We will affirm the district court order.</p>\n<p id=\"b150-17\">On April 15, 1980, Copter, Inc. (\u201cCopter\u201d) made a payment of $17,440. to Gladwin Leasing, Inc. (\u201cGladwin\u201d).<footnotemark>1</footnotemark> On July 23, 1980, 99 days later, Copter filed a voluntary petition under chapter 7 of the Bankruptcy Reform Act of 1978, 11 U.S.C. \u00a7\u00a7 701-66 (Supp. III 1979) (the \u201cBankruptcy Code\u201d); Norman Ackerman was appointed trustee.</p>\n<p id=\"b150-18\">The trustee instituted adversary proceedings against Gladwin in the bankruptcy court seeking to recover the $17,440. payment as a preferential transfer. The trustee had two theories to support his characterization of the transfer as preferential. The first theory was that the transfer was preferential under section 547(b) of the Bankruptcy Code, 11 U.S.C. \u00a7 547(b). The bankruptcy court properly rejected this theory because the transfer was made more than 90 days before the filing of the bankruptcy petition, and section 547(b) provides only that transfers made within 90 days of the filing are preferential.</p>\n<p id=\"b150-19\">The trustee\u2019s second theory was that the transfer was a voidable preference under a Pennsylvania law, 39 Pa.Stat.Ann. \u00a7 151 (Purdons 1954),<footnotemark>2</footnotemark> which provides for a 120-day \u201creach-back\u201d period if the transferor is \u201cinsolvent\u201d at the time of the transfer. The trustee argues that the state statute was incorporated by section 544(b) of the Bankruptcy Code, 11 U.S.C. \u00a7 544(b),<footnotemark>3</footnotemark> which allows a trustee in bankruptcy to void any transfer \u201cvoidable under applica<page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"39\">*39</page-number>ble law by [an unsecured creditor].\u201d The bankruptcy court, in rejecting a motion to dismiss this theory of recovery from Gladwin, concluded that 39 Pa.Stat.Ann. \u00a7 151 was \u201capplicable law\u201d within the meaning of section 544(b) of the Bankruptcy Code.</p>\n<p id=\"b151-5\">.After trial, on April 26, 1982, the bankruptcy judge found that the trustee had established that Copter was insolvent on April 15, 1980. Accordingly, the bankruptcy judge held that the $17,440. payment by Copter to Gladwin was a preferential transfer under 39 Pa.Stat.Ann. \u00a7 151. In the accompanying order, the court voided the transfer and entered judgment in favor of the trustee in the sum of $17,440.</p>\n<p id=\"b151-6\">Gladwin appealed to the district court; on April 8,1983, the district court reversed. The district court held that 39 Pa.Stat.Ann. \u00a7 151 was not \u201capplicable law\u201d within the meaning of section 544(b) of the Bankruptcy Code and, consequently, the trustee could not challenge the alleged preferential transfer under that section.<footnotemark>4</footnotemark></p>\n<p id=\"b151-7\">The allegedly applicable provision of the Bankruptcy Code to the situation presented by this case is the wording in section 544(b), providing that the trustee may avoid a transfer if it is voidable \u201cunder, applicable law\u201d (see note 3 above).</p>\n<p id=\"b151-8\">The trustee argues that any transfer that may be avoided under the state law four-month \u201creach-back\u201d provision of section 151 (see note 2 above) may be avoided in federal bankruptcy proceedings. Before section 151 may apply, \u201cproceedings in insolvency\u201d must be commenced. The trustee argues that a chapter 7 bankruptcy proceeding in federal bankruptcy court is a \u201cproceeding in insolvency\u201d within the meaning of section 151 and that commencement of a chapter 7 proceeding satisfies the Pennsylvania statutory requirement.</p>\n<p id=\"b151-15\">We disagree with the trustee\u2019s argument that section 151 is applicable to this case. As the district court properly recognized, the Pennsylvania legislature was referring to state insolvency proceedings when it addressed voidable preferences in section 151.<footnotemark>5</footnotemark> References throughout the Insolvency Act indicate that the reference to \u201cproceedings in insolvency\u201d in section 151 was intended to incorporate the state insolvency procedure set forth in 39 Pa.Stat.Ann. \u00a7 31; there is no indication that section 151 referred to federal bankruptcy proceedings. <em>See </em>39 Pa.Stat.Ann. \u00a7\u00a7 31, 151, 152. Moreover, there had been no assignment for the benefit of creditors, nor had a state court insolvency proceeding commenced.</p>\n<p id=\"b151-16\">The decision of this court in <em>In Re McEl-wain, </em>296 F. 112 (3d Cir.1924), demonstrates how the Pennsylvania Act of June 4, 1901, was intended to operate in harmony with the Federal Bankruptcy Act.<footnotemark>6</footnotemark> Using this language at page 114, this court stated:</p>\n<blockquote id=\"AV\">\u201c[T]he Pennsylvania Insolvency Act is ... in harmony with the policy of the Bankruptcy Act and in aid of its purpose. * * *</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b151-19\">\u201cIt will thus be seen the state act in question is not a bankruptcy act, but one of insolvency administration, and <em>while all proceedings thereunder are, of course, superseded when a bankrupt [sic] proceeding is begun, </em>yet there is no reason why the bankrupt [sic] court should not avail itself of the status and proceedings <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"40\">*40</page-number>then existing in the state court proceeding where such status or proceedings may aid in the administration by the bankruptcy court, of the bankrupt\u2019s property. This view of the state act finds support in cases, federal and state, in Pennsylvania.\u201d [Emphasis added.]</blockquote>\n<p id=\"b152-4\">Accordingly, the judgment of the district court will be affirmed.</p>\n<footnote label=\"1\">\n<p id=\"b150-13\">. On April 15, 1980, Copter owed Gladwin more than $24,000.</p>\n</footnote>\n<footnote label=\"2\">\n<p id=\"b150-14\">. The state statute, 39 Pa.Stat.Ann. \u00a7 151 (Act of June 4, 1901, P.L. 404, \u00a7 1), provides:</p>\n<blockquote id=\"b150-15\">\u201cIf any person, persons, firm, limited partnership, joint-stock company or corporation, being insolvent or in contemplation of insolvency, with a view to give a preference to any creditor ... shall make any payment, ... either absolutely or as collateral security for a debt then existing, ... such ... payment ... shall inure to the benefit of all the creditors of such insolvent, if an assignment tor the benefit of creditors be made or proceedings in insolvency be commenced within <em>four months </em>after such ... payment ... shall have been ... made .... \u201d (Emphasis added.)</blockquote>\n</footnote>\n<footnote label=\"3\">\n<p id=\"b150-20\">. Title 11 U.S.C. \u00a7 544(b) provides:</p>\n<blockquote id=\"b150-21\">\u201c(b) The trustee may avoid any transfer of an interest of the debtor in property or any obligation incurred by the debtor that is voidable under applicable law by a creditor holding an unsecured claim that is allowable under section 502 of this title .. .. \u201d</blockquote>\n</footnote>\n<footnote label=\"4\">\n<p id=\"b151-9\">. A second basis for the district court\u2019s opinion was that the application of 39 Pa.Stat.Ann. \u00a7 151 was preempted by section 547(b) of the Bankruptcy Code. Because we feel that an interpretation of the Pennsylvania statute is dispositive of this case, we do not reach the preemption issue.</p>\n</footnote>\n<footnote label=\"5\">\n<p id=\"b151-10\">. Judge Broderick noted that:</p>\n<blockquote id=\"b151-11\">\u201cThe language of the state law shows that the Pennsylvania legislature was referring to state insolvency proceedings rather than to federal bankruptcy proceedings .... [A] bankruptcy petition is not a \u2018proceeding in insolvency\u2019 within the meaning of 39 P.S. 151.\u201d</blockquote>\n<p id=\"b151-22\">(District court opinion at 3.)</p>\n</footnote>\n<footnote label=\"6\">\n<p id=\"b151-23\">. Under the Bankruptcy Act of 1898, 11 U.S.C. \u00a7 96, a transfer could be avoided if the trustee could show that the transfer had taken place within four months before the commencement of a case under the statute, when the debtor was insolvent, and the transferee either knew of such insolvency or had reasonable cause to believe that it existed. The Bankruptcy Act of 1898 was repealed by the Bankruptcy Reform Act of 1978, 11 U.S.C. \u00a7 401(a).</p>\n</footnote>\n</opinion>\n</casebody>\n",
