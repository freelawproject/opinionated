Mount Sinai Hospital, </em>703 F.2d 36 (2d Cir.1983), we distinguished <em>United Parcel Service, Inc. v. Mitchell, </em>451 U.S. 56, 101 S.Ct. 1559, 67 L.Ed.2d 732 (1981), and held that in a suit by an employee against an employer for wrongful discharge and against the union for breach of its duty of fair representation brought pursuant to section 301(a) of the Labor Management Relations Act, 29 U.S.C. \u00a7 185(a) (1976), in which no arbitration took place, the more appropriate limitations period for the claim against the employer was the six month period found in section 10(b) of the National Labor Relations Act (NLRA), 29 U.S.C. \u00a7 160(b) (1976). However, we felt bound by <em>Flowers v. Local 2602 of the United Steelworkers, </em>671 F.2d 87 (2d Cir.), <em>cert. granted, </em>459 U.S. 1034, 103 S.Ct. 442, 74 L.Ed.2d 599 (1982), to apply a three year statute of limitations to the claim against the union. Recognizing that our application of disparate limitations periods, created practical problems, we said in <em>Assad: </em>\u201cThe entire panel looks forward to guidance from the Supreme Court when it considers <em>Flowers.\u201d </em>703 F.2d at 44 n. 3. That guidance has now been provided.</p>\n<p id=\"b950-11\">On June 8, 1983 the Supreme Court decided <em>DelCostello v. International Brotherhood of Teamsters, </em>\u2014 U.S. \u2014, 103 S.Ct. 2281, 76 L.Ed.2d 476 (1983), and <em>United Steelworkers v. Flowers, id. </em>In a joint decision the Court announced that a federal statute of limitations, namely, the six month period provided by section 10(b) of the NLRA, should govern both claims against the employer and the union.</p>\n<p id=\"b950-14\">On October 3, 1983 the Supreme Court granted the petition for a writ of certiorari in this case, vacated the judgment and remanded the case to us for further consideration in light of <em>DelCostello. District 1199 v. </em>Assad, \u2014 U.S. \u2014, 104 S.Ct. 54, 78 L.Ed.2d 73 (1983).</p>\n<p id=\"b950-17\">Because Assad failed to commence her action against the employer and the union within the six month period we affirm the order of the district court dismissing the complaint against all defendants.</p>\n</opinion>\n</casebody>\n",
