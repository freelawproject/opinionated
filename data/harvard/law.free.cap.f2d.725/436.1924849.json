Previously Sayles had pled guilty to and served an eighteen-month sentence for robbery and attempted murder committed in 1967 when he was seventeen years old. In response to Sayles\u2019 challenges to two of these denials, brought in federal court by means of successive petitions for writs of habeas corpus, Magistrate Cohn of the United States District Court for the Southern District of Illinois,<footnotemark>1</footnotemark> found the 1981 and the August 1982 parole denials defective and ordered new parole hearings in each case.<footnotemark>2</footnotemark> However, the magistrate found that the December 1982 fourth denial <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"438\">*438</page-number>complied with constitutional requirements. Sayles appeals this decision. We affirm.</p>\n<p id=\"b550-4\">Sayles makes several arguments in his challenge to the Board\u2019s December 1982 decision to deny him parole but essentially they are all restatements of the claim that even the Board\u2019s last rationale violated this Court\u2019s holding in <em>Welsh v. Mizell, </em>668 F.2d 328 (7th Cir.1982), certiorari denied, 459 U.S. 923, 103 S.Ct. 235, 74 L.Ed.2d 186. In that case, we decided that general deterrence concerns, incorporated into Illinois parole law for the first time in 1973 (see Ill.Rev.Stat.1973, ch. 38, \u00a7 1003-3-5(c)(2), were substantially harsher than the specific deterrence criteria used exclusively in parole decisions until that time. Applying general deterrence criteria to convicts like Welsh and Sayles whose crimes were committed before 1973 was held to be a violation of the <em>ex post facto </em>clause of the United States Constitution, U.S. Const, art. I, \u00a7 9, and therefore impermissible.</p>\n<p id=\"b550-5\">It is well settled that decisions to grant or deny parole are within the discretion of the agency created by statute to review such matters. <em>E.g., Greenholtz v. Nebraska Penal Inmates, </em>442 U.S. 1, 99 S.Ct. 2100, 60 L.Ed.2d 668 (1979). Decisions made by such an agency are not to be disturbed by the courts absent a determination that the agency abused its discretion by exceeding the constraints imposed specifically by statute or generally by constitution. See <em>Welsh, </em>668 F.2d 328. There is no basis for such a determination in this case. <em>Welsh </em>clearly required the Board to use specific deterrence criteria in deciding whether to parole Sayles, since Sayles committed the crimes for which he is incarcerated in 1971 before Illinois authorized use of general deterrence criteria. Applying specific deterrence criteria means that the Board had to evaluate the factors in Sayles\u2019 case to determine whether he was by then deterred from committing further criminal acts, rather than considering whether Sayles\u2019 further imprisonment would deter others from criminal activity.</p>\n<p id=\"b550-10\">A review of the Board\u2019s rationale for its December 17, 1982, decision<footnotemark>3</footnotemark> makes it clear that the Board in fact correctly used only specific deterrence criteria in deciding to deny parole to Sayles. Nothing in the rationale indicates that the Board considered whether denying parole to Sayles would deter the general public from committing crimes similar to his. On the other hand, the Board\u2019s reiteration of the factors it considered about Sayles himself evidences its efforts to determine whether Sayles specifically was rehabilitated and therefore deterred from such further criminal conduct. The Board weighed the facts of his criminal episodes of 1967 and 1971 against his exemplary prison conduct, his academic achieve<page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"439\">*439</page-number>ment, and his community and family support. The Board concluded that as positive as these latter factors were, they were not sufficient to convince the Board that Sayles was yet \u201ccapable of again becoming a law-abiding citizen.\u201d Ill.Rev.Stat.1969, ch. 108, \u00a7 203; <em>Welsh, </em>668 F.2d at 330 (quoting Ill.Rev.Stat.1961, eh. 38, \u00a7 806). Thus the decision to deny parole and the rationale explaining that decision were made within the constraints of the parole statute in effect in 1971 and were therefore properly approved by the District Court\u2019s Magistrate.</p>\n<p id=\"b551-5\">Sayles contends, however, that the Board\u2019s reference to the nature of his 1971 crimes shows that its decision was made on impermissible general deterrence grounds. Sayles\u2019 contention misconstrues both the concept of general deterrence and the substance of the parole statute applied to him. As Magistrate Cohn noted, \u201cit is permissible to consider the relationship of crimes committed to the likelihood of rehabilitation.\u201d <em>Sayles </em>v. <em>Welborn, </em>Civil No. 82-3109, slip op. at 2 (S.D.Ill. Jan. 20, 1983). In fact, the then parole statute itself requires the Board to give \u201cdue consideration * * * to the records and professional reports kept by the Department [as well as] all other aspects of the prisoner\u2019s situation.\u201d Ill.Rev.Stat.1969, ch. 108, \u00a7 206. Among the records that must be kept by the Department is a statement by the State\u2019s Attorney which includes \u201cthe facts and circumstances constituting the crime or offense whereof the prisoner * * * was convicted * * * and any other facts or circumstances which may tend to throw light upon the question as to whether such prisoner * * * is capable of again becoming a law-abiding citizen.\u201d <em>Id. </em>at \u00a7 203. It is clear that the State\u2019s Attorney filed such a report in this case, since the Board referred to it in its August 1982 rationale for denying parole (Pet.App. B). Thus the Board was not only permitted to consider the facts surrounding Sayles\u2019 1971 crimes but was required by statute to give these facts \u201cdue consideration\u201d in reaching its decision. The only constraint on the Board\u2019s consideration of these facts was the requirement that its consideration be focused specifically on the question of whether Sayles was rehabilitated rather than on the issue of general societal deterrence. <em>Welsh, supra. </em>As we have already shown, the Board complied with that requirement.</p>\n<p id=\"b551-8\">Sayles claims that even if the Board\u2019s rationale for its December 17, 1982, decision facially complies with <em>Welsh, </em>certain events suggest that the Board in fact relied on general deterrence criteria in reaching the decision and warrant this Court\u2019s finding the rationale illegal. In support of this claim, Sayles cites the fact that the Board did not issue its rationale for its informal November denial until December 17, 1982. It is true that a post-hoc rationale may warrant less judicial deference than a rationale issued simultaneously with the decision. <em>Clement </em>v. <em>Securities and Exchange Commission, </em>674 F.2d 641, 644 (7th Cir.1982). But even when the Board\u2019s decision is subjected to greater scrutiny there is no basis for Sayles\u2019 claim.</p>\n<p id=\"b551-9\">On its own volition, the Board initiated the November 1982 parole review, even before Magistrate Cohn issued his November 22 decision as to the illegality of the Board\u2019s rationale for its August 1982 parole denial. Although Magistrate Cohn ultimately decided that said rationale did not comply with his order of July 22, 1982, he did not say that the August 1982 rationale definitely applied general deterrence criteria. <em>Sayles v. Welborn, </em>Civil No. 82-3109 (S.D. Ill. Nov. 22, 1982). In fact it is clear that the Board had made a good faith effort to base its August 1982 decision on special deterrence criteria.<footnotemark>4</footnotemark> Certainly it would have been preferable for the Board to postpone its informal November 1982 decision <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"440\">*440</page-number>pending the issuance of Magistrate Cohn\u2019s November 22, 1982 order invalidating the Board\u2019s August 31, 1982, parole denial. However, since the Board had made the good faith effort in August to comply with <em>Welsh, </em>there is no basis to conclude that its proper rationale issued on December 17, 1982, was in fact motivated by impermissible general deterrence criteria.<footnotemark>5</footnotemark></p>\n<p id=\"b552-4\">For the reasons stated above, the January 18,1983, order of the magistrate upholding the December 17, 1982, parole denial is affirmed.</p>\n<footnote label=\"1\">\n<p id=\"b549-10\">. The cause was referred to Magistrate Cohn for final determination with the consent of both parties pursuant to 28 U.S.C. \u00a7 636(c).</p>\n</footnote>\n<footnote label=\"2\">\n<p id=\"b549-21\">. Sayles did not seek review of the November 1980 denial of parole and therefore it was not the subject of Magistrate Cohn\u2019s or this Court\u2019s review.</p>\n</footnote>\n<footnote label=\"3\">\n<p id=\"b550-6\">. The rationale for the December 17, 1982, formal denial (confirming its informal November 1982 decision not to grant Sayles parole) was as follows:</p>\n<p id=\"b550-7\">A thorough review of your file reflects that you, after having previously pled guilty to the crimes of robbery and attempt [sic] murder, and having served your sentence in a maximum security institution, were thereafter, in 1971, charged, tried by a jury and found guilty of the murder of two persons, a man and his wife, while engaged in the commission of yet another felony, armed robbery, during a home invasion. For these crime [sic ] you were sentenced to terms of 100-200 years, 20-40 years, 100-200 years and 20-40 years (four concurrent, but the murder sentence involving Edith Snyder to be served consecutively to Arthur Snyder\u2019s two counts.)</p>\n<p id=\"b550-8\">These murders were especially heinous, it being described in the Official Statement of Facts that you took a claw hammer and using both sides of the head of the hammer, \u201cbeat and ripped Edith Snyder\u2019s face, skull and body apart ... literally beat Arthur Snyder\u2019s brains out, leaving the hammer deeply imbedded in Arthur\u2019s skull\u201d, subsequently setting fire to the mattress upon which lay the dead body of Edith Snyder.</p>\n<p id=\"b550-12\">The Prisoner Review Board has considered many factors in your particular case, among which are the personal interview, the representations made by your attorneys and your wife, your lengthy term of incarceration, the fact that you are A Grade and have been involved in educational programs while incarcerated. However, in denying parole at this time, the Board feels that given your two serious departures from acceptable behavi-our in the free community, the factors that weigh against your release outweigh those which would dictate your release.</p>\n<p id=\"b550-13\">(Pet.App. D)</p>\n</footnote>\n<footnote label=\"4\">\n<p id=\"b551-6\">. For instance, the Board indicated that a significant reason for its August 1982 decision was that \u201cthe risk of further nonconforming conduct is too great for release at this time,\u201d a reason indicating a focus on Sayles\u2019 own rehabilitation rather than on general societal deterrence (Pet.App. B). While the Magistrate thought the Board should have been clearer in August 1982 that its denial was based on specific deterrence, he faulted the Board for not having stated \u201cessential facts\u201d for its decision <em>(ibid.).</em></p>\n</footnote>\n<footnote label=\"5\">\n<p id=\"b552-16\">. Petitioner\u2019s other contentions on appeal do not merit discussion, but in the future, the Board should not \u201cjump the gun\u201d by informally announcing a decision without simultaneously including a rationale therefor.</p>\n<p id=\"b552-30\">Respondents\u2019 motion to strike filed herein on June 28, 1983, is granted and the Court <em>sua sponte </em>also strikes Argument IV of petitioner\u2019s reply brief. Petitioner\u2019s November 30, 1983, motion to file clarifying letter was granted on December 2, 1983.</p>\n</footnote>\n</opinion>\n</casebody>\n",
