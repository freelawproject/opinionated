Plaintiffs contend that various provisions of the statute are unconstitutionally overbroad or vague; that the statute\u2019s definition of obscenity varies impermissibly from that established by the Supreme Court; that the statute\u2019s penalty provisions and lack of procedural safeguards serve to chill protected first amendment expression; and that the sanctions imposed by the statute violate the eighth amendment\u2019s prohibition against cruel and unusual punishment. After a trial on the merits, the district court rejected plaintiffs\u2019 challenges and refused to enjoin enforcement of the statute. We find that the anti-obscenity statute is unconstitutional and reverse.</p>\n<p id=\"b596-21\">BACKGROUND</p>\n<p id=\"b596-22\">In 1977 the voters of the state of Washington adopted an initiative measure that established procedures to temporarily and permanently enjoin the operation of moral nuisances. Wash.Rev.Code \u00a7\u00a7 7.48.050-100 (West.Supp.1980). In a decision affirmed by the Supreme Court, we found that this moral nuisance law was unconstitutional because it failed to provide procedural safeguards necessary for the protection of first amendment freedoms. <em>Spokane Arcades, Inc. </em>v. <em>Brockett, </em>631 F.2d 135, 137-39 (9th Cir.1980), <em>aff\u2019d, </em>454 U.S. 1022, 102 S.Ct. 557, 70 L.Ed.2d 468 (1981).</p>\n<p id=\"b596-23\">Apparently in response to the fact that the voters\u2019 initiative measure had been declared unconstitutional, the Washington state legislature enacted into law the statute that plaintiffs challenge here. This statute, known as House Bill 626,<footnotemark>1</footnotemark> establishes a dual system of civil and criminal penalties for those who maintain \u201cmoral nuisances\u201d as defined in Section II.</p>\n<p id=\"b596-24\">House Bill 626 became effective on April 1, 1982. On April 5, 1982, plaintiffs J-R Distributors and Azure Entertainment <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"485\">*485</page-number>Corporation filed separate suits in the United States District Court for the Eastern District of Washington. These suits, brought pursuant to 42 U.S.C. \u00a7 1983 (Supp. IV 1980), sought declaratory and in-junctive relief against the statute\u2019s enforcement. Subsequently, the five other plaintiffs filed similar law suits. All seven cases were consolidated by the district court.<footnotemark>2</footnotemark></p>\n<p id=\"b597-5\">On April 13, 1982, the district court issued a preliminary injunction against enforcement of House Bill 626. The case proceeded to trial before the district judge, and on July 2, 1982, the court rejected plaintiffs\u2019 challenges and affirmed the constitutionality of House Bill 626. <em>Spokane Arcades, Inc. v. Eikenberry, </em>544 F.Supp. 1034 (E.D.Wash. 1982). Although the district judge denied plaintiffs\u2019 motion for an injunction pending appeal, he did stay his judgments to allow plaintiffs to seek a stay pending appeal from this court. Ninth Circuit Rules of Appellate Procedure, Rule 6(i). On October 13, 1982, we granted the motions of plaintiffs J-R and Azure and enjoined the enforcement of House Bill 626 pending resolution of this appeal.</p>\n<p id=\"b597-11\">We exercise jurisdiction under 28 U.S.C. \u00a7 1331 (1976), because plaintiffs\u2019 claims raise federal questions, and under 28 U.S.C. \u00a7 1343(3) (1976), because plaintiffs allege civil rights violations under section 1983.<footnotemark>3</footnotemark></p>\n<p id=\"b597-12\">FACIAL CHALLENGES TO ALLEGEDLY UNCONSTITUTIONAL STATUTES</p>\n<p id=\"A_U\">Plaintiffs\u2019 constitutional attacks on House Bill 626 were launched almost imme<page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"486\">*486</page-number>diately after the statute became effective. Prior to trial, the district court issued an injunction against enforcement of the statute, and we have done the same for the pendency of this appeal. Consequently, Washington state, county and city officials have not yet had the opportunity to enforce House Bill 626.<footnotemark>4</footnotemark> Plaintiffs\u2019 suits thus constitute facial challenges to a statute that has yet to be authoritatively interpreted or enforced.</p>\n<p id=\"b598-4\">The Supreme Court has consistently entertained facial challenges when first amendment rights have been at stake. As Justice Marshall recently emphasized, the Supreme Court has \u201crepeatedly recognized that a statute which sweeps within its ambit a broad range of expression protected by the First Amendment should be struck down on its face.\u201d <em>United States </em>v. Grace, \u2014U.S. \u2014, \u2014, 103 S.Ct. 1702, 1712, 75 L.Ed.2d 736 (1983) (Marshall, J., concurring in part and dissenting in part) (footnote omitted). <em>See, e.g., United States v. Robel, </em>389 U.S. 258, 88 S.Ct. 419, 19 L.Ed.2d 508 (1967); <em>Keyishian </em>v. <em>Board of Regents, </em>385 U.S. 589, 609-610, 87 S.Ct. 675, 687-688, 17 L.Ed.2d 629 (1967); <em>Elfbrandt v. Russell, </em>384 U.S. 11, 19, 86 S.Ct. 1238, 1242, 16 L.Ed.2d 321 (1966); <em>Dombrowski v. Pfister, </em>380 U.S. 479, 486, 85 S.Ct. 1116, 1120, 14 L.Ed.2d 22 (1965); <em>Thornhill v. Alabama, </em>310 U.S. 88, 97-98, 60 S.Ct. 736, 741-742, 84 L.Ed. 1093 (1940); <em>Lovell </em>v. <em>Griffin, </em>303 U.S. 444, 451, 58 S.Ct. 666, 668, 82 L.Ed. 949 (1938). Specifically, the Supreme Court has upheld such overbreadth challenges in cases involving the regulation of obscenity. <em>See, e.g., Interstate Circuit, Inc. v. City of Dallas, </em>390 U.S. 676, 88 S.Ct. 1298, 20 L.Ed.2d 225 (1968); <em>Freedman v. Maryland, </em>380 U.S. 51, 85 S.Ct. 734, 13 L.Ed.2d 649 (1965); <em>Smith v. California, </em>361 U.S. 147, 80 S.Ct. 215, 4 L.Ed.2d 205 (1959).</p>\n<p id=\"b598-7\">Were facial challenges not permitted, overbroad statutes would often restrict protected expression, even though they might ultimately be declared unconstitutional. To begin with, first amendment freedoms \u201care delicate and vulnerable,\u201d and the very \u201cthreat of sanctions may deter their exercise almost as potently as the actual application of sanctions.\u201d <em>NAACP </em>v. <em>Button, </em>371 U.S. 415, 433, 83 S.Ct. 328, 338, 9 L.Ed.2d 405 (1963). Unconstitutionally overbroad statutes can chill protected expression by causing \u201ca continuous and pervasive restraint on all freedom of discussion that might reasonably be regarded as within [their] purview.\u201d <em>Thornhill v. Alabama, </em>310 U.S. at 98, 60 S.Ct. at 742. Only by permitting facial attacks on such statutes can the unfettered exercise of first amendment freedoms be protected.</p>\n<p id=\"b598-12\">Second, facial challenges are necessary because the alternative of awaiting the outcome of individual prosecutions in state courts does not adequately protect first amendment freedoms. Aside from the enormously high costs and lengthy delays involved, <em>see, e.g., Zwickler v. Koota, </em>389 U.S. 241, 252, 88 S.Ct. 391, 397, 19 L.Ed.2d 444 (1967); <em>Dombrowski v. Pfister, </em>380 U.S. at 486-87, 490-91, 85 S.Ct. at 1120-21, 1122-23; <em>Baggett v. Bullitt, </em>377 U.S. 360, 378-79, 84 S.Ct. 1316, 1326-27, 12 L.Ed.2d 377 (1964), a person thinking of engaging in protected behavior may be deterred from acting by the risk of conviction, even though his challenge to the law might eventually be upheld. Consequently, the chill on protected activity deters those whose legal challenges are necessary to narrow an overly broad statute. Absent facial challenges to overbreadth, then, \u201cthe contours of [a statute] would have to be hammered out case by case\u2014and tested only by those hardy enough to risk criminal prosecution to determine the [statute\u2019s] proper scope.\u201d <em>Dombrowski v. Pfister, </em>380 U.S. at 487, 85 S.Ct. at 1121.</p>\n<p id=\"b598-13\">The Supreme Court has indicated that there may sometimes be strong policy reasons against applying the overbreadth doc<page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"487\">*487</page-number>trine in a facial review of a statute\u2019s constitutionality. <em>See Broadrick v. Oklahoma, </em>413 U.S. 601, 93 S.Ct. 2908, 37 L.Ed.2d 830 (1973). A major exception to this approach, however, is in the area of first amendment rights. <em>See, e.g., Stoianoff </em>v. <em>Montana, </em>695 F.2d 1214, 1218 (9th Cir.1983). In the case of an ordinary facial challenge to the over-breadth of a law, \u201ca court\u2019s first task is to determine whether the enactment reaches a substantial amount of constitutionally protected conduct. If it does not, then the overbreadth challenge must fail.\u201d <em>Village of Hoffman Estates v. Flipside, Hoffman Estates, </em>455 U.S. 489, 494, 102 S.Ct. 1186, 1191, 71 L.Ed.2d 362 (1982) (footnote omitted). <em>See also Kolender v. Lawson, </em>\u2014 U.S. \u2014, \u2014 n. 8, 103 S.Ct. 1855, 1859 n. 8, 75 L.Ed.2d 903 (1983); <em>Stoianoff v. Montana, </em>695 F.2d at 1218; <em>Grand Faloon Tavern, Inc. v. Wicker, </em>670 F.2d 943, 946 (11th Cir.), cert. <em>denied, </em>459 U.S. 859, 103 S.Ct. 132, 74 L.Ed.2d 113 (1982). The Supreme Court\u2019s decision in <em>Broadrick, </em>however, \u201cimplies that a finding of substantial over-breadth is necessary only when the challenged statute regulates conduct and not speech.\u201d <em>Turchick v. United States, </em>561 F.2d 719, 722 (8th Cir.1977). In first amendment overbreadth cases, \u201ca challenge to a statute regulating pure speech would succeed on a lesser showing of facial over-breadth.\u201d <em>Id. </em>at 722 n. 6.</p>\n<p id=\"b599-6\">For these reasons, then, we do not hesitate to entertain plaintiffs\u2019 first amendment facial challenges to House Bill 626.<footnotemark>5</footnotemark></p>\n<p id=\"b599-7\">ABSTENTION</p>\n<p id=\"b599-8\">Defendants\u2019 general argument that federal courts should abstain from deciding the constitutionality of House Bill 626 until the Washington state courts first have an opportunity to construe its provisions was rejected by the district court. <em>Spokane Arcade, Inc. </em>v. <em>Eikenberry, </em>544 F.Supp. at 1037. We will reverse the district court on the issue of abstention only when there has been an abuse of discretion. <em>See, e.g., Midkiff v. Tom, </em>702 F.2d 788, 789 n. 1, 799 (9th Cir.1983); <em>Turf Paradise, Inc. v. Arizona Downs, </em>670 F.2d 813, 819 (9th Cir.), <em>cert. denied, </em>456 U.S. 1011, 102 S.Ct. 2308, 73 L.Ed.2d 1308 (1982); <em>Shamrock Dev. Co. v. City of Concord, </em>656 F.2d 1380, 1385 (9th Cir.1981). We find that the district court correctly held that abstention would be inappropriate.</p>\n<p id=\"b599-13\">We begin with the settled proposition that \u201ca federal court must decide the cases properly before it; abstention from the exercise of jurisdiction is the exception to the rule.\u201d <em>Midkiff v. Tom, </em>702 F.2d at 789 n. 1. <em>See also Colorado River Water Conservation Dist. v. United States, </em>424 U.S. 800, 813, 96 S.Ct. 1236, 1244, 47 L.Ed.2d 483 (1976); <em>Shamrock Dev. Co. v. City of Concord, </em>656 F.2d at 1385. Indeed, constitutional challenges based on the first amendment right of free expression are the kind of cases that federal courts are particularly well-suited to hear. That is why abstention is generally inappropriate when first amendment rights are at stake. <em>See Spokane Arcades, Inc. v. Brockett, </em>631 F.2d at 137. <em>See also Vance v. Universal Amusement Co., Inc., </em>445 U.S. 308, 100 S.Ct. 1156, 63 L.Ed.2d 413 (1980); <em>Zwickler v. Koota, </em>389 U.S. at 252, 88 S.Ct. at 397.</p>\n<p id=\"b599-14\">Nonetheless, defendants argue that abstention under the <em>Pullman </em>doctrine is appropriate in this case. <em>Railroad Commission </em>v. <em>Pullman Co., </em>312 U.S. 496, 501, 61 S.Ct. 643, 645, 85 L.Ed. 971 (1941). Even a cursory analysis of the three <em>Pullman </em>factors, however, explains why <em>Pullman </em>abstention is rarely, if ever, appropriate in first amendment cases. To abstain under <em>Pullman, </em>a federal court must find that all three of the following factors are applicable: first, that the suit touches a sensitive area of social policy upon which the federal courts ought not to enter unless no alternative for adjudication exists; second, that a <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"488\">*488</page-number>definitive ruling on the state issue in question would end the controversy; and third, that the possibly determinative issue of state law is doubtful. <em>See, e.g., Midkiff v. Tom, </em>702 F.2d at 789 n. 1; <em>Canton v. Spokane School District No. 81, </em>498 F.2d 840, 845 (9th Cir.1974). <em>See also Colorado River Water Conservation District v. United States, </em>424 U.S. at 814, 96 S.Ct. at 1244; <em>Knudsen Corp. v. Nevada State Dairy Commission, </em>676 F.2d 374, 377 (9th Cir.1982). In first amendment cases, the first of these factors will almost never be present because the constitutional guarantee of free expression is, quite properly, always an area of particular federal concern. <em>See, e.g., C-Y Development Co. v. City of Redlands, </em>703 F.2d 375, 381 (9th Cir.1983) (citations omitted) (\u201c[T]he Supreme Court has demonstrated a reluctance to order abstention in cases involving certain civil rights claims, such as voting rights, racial equality, and first amendments rights of expression.\u201d); <em>Jones v. Metzger, </em>456 F.2d 854, 856 (6th Cir.1972) (\u201cEven if a viable option were available to [plaintiffs] under state law, it is well-established ... that when fundamental civil rights are at issue, federal courts should hesitate to abstain.\u201d); <em>Hobbs v. Thompson, </em>448 F.2d 456, 463 (5th Cir.1971) (\u201c[I]n a facial attack [on first amendment grounds] the special circumstances which have been held to justify abstention ... are usually absent.\u201d).</p>\n<p id=\"b600-4\">Moreover, abstention by federal courts in first amendment cases could often result in the suppression of free speech that is meant to be protected by the Constitution. As the Supreme Court has emphasized, to abstain and thus \u201cforce the plaintiff who has commenced a federal action to suffer the delay of state court proceedings might itself effect the impermissible chilling of the very constitutional right he seeks to protect.\u201d <em>Zwickler v. Koota, </em>389 U.S. at 252, 88 S.Ct. at 397-98. <em>See also Procunier v. Martinez, </em>416 U.S. 396, 405, 94 S.Ct. 1800, 1807, 40 L.Ed.2d 224 (1974) (\u201c[W]e are mindful of the high cost of abstention when the federal constitutional challenge concerns facial repugnance to the First Amendment.\u201d); <em>Gar-vin </em>v. <em>Rosenau, </em>455 F.2d 233, 239 (6th Cir. 1972) (\u201cFurther delay necessitated by abstention would be inconsistent with the policy of protecting the First Amendment against possible chilling influences.\u201d).</p>\n<p id=\"b600-7\">Even if this were a case that did not involve first amendment rights, <em>Pullman </em>abstention would still be inappropriate. The second and third <em>Pullman </em>factors suggest that abstention is only proper when a federal constitutional issue may be avoided or presented differently once a state law issue is resolved or a state statute is construed. <em>See, e.g., Spokane Arcades, Inc. v. Brockett, </em>631 F.2d at 137. In this case, we find that several key provisions of House Bill 626 are not susceptible to such saving constructions. Consequently, <em>Pullman </em>abstention would neither eliminate nor materially change the constitutional issues presented here. <em>See, e.g, Ohio Bureau of Employment Services v. Hodory, </em>431 U.S. 471, 481, 97 S.Ct. 1898, 1904, 52 L.Ed.2d 513 (1976); <em>Spokane Arcades, Inc. v. Brockett, </em>631 F.2d at 137. In short, \u201cthe naked question, uncomplicated by an unresolved state law, is whether the [statute] on its face is unconstitutional.\u201d <em>Wisconsin v. Constantineau, </em>400 U.S. 433, 439, 91 S.Ct. 507, 511, 27 L.Ed.2d 515 (1971). Abstention would not have been appropriate.</p>\n<p id=\"b600-8\">We therefore find that the district court did not abuse its discretion in deciding plaintiffs\u2019 claims on their merits.<footnotemark>6</footnotemark></p>\n<p id=\"b601-4\"><page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"489\">*489</page-number>PLAINTIFFS\u2019 CONSTITUTIONAL CHALLENGES</p>\n<p id=\"b601-5\">I. <em>The Definition of Obscenity in House Bill 626 Unconstitutionally Includes Protected First Amendment Expression.</em></p>\n<p id=\"b601-6\">A.</p>\n<p id=\"b601-7\">The judicial effort to find an acceptable definition for obscenity constitutes one of the longest and most arduous struggles in the history of American jurisprudence. After employing several different definitions, the Supreme Court finally adopted a three-part test in <em>Miller v. California, </em>413 U.S. 15, 93 S.Ct. 2607, 37 L.Ed.2d 419 (1973). Under the <em>Miller </em>test, speech is obscene and thus not protected under the first amendment if three guidelines are satisfied:</p>\n<blockquote id=\"b601-8\">(a) whether \u201cthe average person, applying contemporary community standards\u201d would find that the work, taken as a whole, appeals to the prurient interest;</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b601-9\">(b) whether the work depicts or describes, in a patently offensive way, sexual conduct specifically defined by the applicable state law; and (c) whether the work, taken as a whole, lacks serious literary, artistic, political or scientific value.</blockquote>\n<p id=\"b601-10\">413 U.S. at 24, 93 S.Ct. at 2615 (citations omitted).</p>\n<p id=\"b601-11\">Despite the continued adherence to the <em>Miller </em>test, few would disagree with the view that only a \u201cdim and uncertain line\u201d separates obscenity from constitutionally protected speech. <em>Bantam Books, Inc. v. Sullivan, </em>372 U.S. 58, 66, 83 S.Ct. 631, 637, 9 L.Ed.2d 584 (1963). As Justices Brennan, Stewart and Marshall remarked, \u201cone cannot say with certainty that material is obscene until at least five members of [the Supreme] Court, applying inevitably obscure standards, have pronounced it so.\u201d <em>Jenkins v. Georgia, </em>418 U.S. 153, 164-65, 94 S.Ct. 2750, 2757, 41 L.Ed.2d 642 (1974) (Brennan, Stewart and Marshall, JJ., concurring), <em>quoting Paris Adult Theatre I v. Slaton, </em>413 U.S. 49, 92, 93 S.Ct. 2628, 2652, 37 L.Ed.2d 446 (1973) (Brennan, J., dissenting). Yet, on one side of the <em>Miller </em>line, speech is entitled to the highest form of protection afforded by our laws and constitution, while, on the other side, speech that is held obscene may be punished as a crime.</p>\n<p id=\"b601-15\">Because of the inevitable uncertainty as to where the line will be drawn and the critical importance of not interfering with constitutionally protected speech, courts have insisted that the <em>Miller </em>guidelines be followed without deviation. <em>See, e.g., Hamling v. United States, </em>418 U.S. 87, 114, 94 S.Ct. 2887, 2906, 41 L.Ed.2d 590 (1974) <em>(\u201cMiller ... </em>was speaking in terms of substantive constitutional law of the First and Fourteenth Amendments ... [and establishes] a limit beyond which neither legislative draftsmen nor juries may go .... \u201d).<footnotemark>7</footnotemark> When the <em>Miller </em>guidelines were adopted, the Supreme Court emphasized that \u201c[s]tate statutes designed to regulate obscenity must be <em>carefully limited. </em>As a result, we now <em>confine the permissible scope </em>of such regulation to works\u201d that satisfy the three-part test. <em>Miller, </em>413 U.S. at 23-<page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"490\">*490</page-number>24, 93 S.Ct. at 2614 (emphasis added, citation omitted). To assure that protected speech is not impermissibly regulated, then, even subtle deviations from the <em>Miller </em>standards must be carefully examined.</p>\n<p id=\"b602-4\">The first requirement under <em>Miller </em>is that the average person, applying contemporary community standards, would find \u201cthat the work, taken as a whole, appeals to the prurient interest.\u201d <em>Miller, </em>413 U.S. at 24, 93 S.Ct. at 2615. Section l(2)(a) of the Washington anti-obscenity law tracks the <em>Miller </em>prurient interest requirement almost exactly. Section 1(8), however, defines \u201cprurient\u201d as \u201cthat which incites lasciviousness or lust.\u201d Plaintiffs contend that the inclusion of \u201clust\u201d in the definition of \u201cprurient\u201d impermissibly expands the boundaries of the <em>Miller </em>guidelines and renders House Bill 626 unconstitutional. We agree.</p>\n<p id=\"b602-5\">The Supreme Court first attempted to define \u201cprurient\u201d in a footnote in <em>Roth v. United States, </em>354 U.S. 476, 77 S.Ct. 1304, 1 L.Ed.2d 1498 (1957). The Court began by noting that \u201cmaterial having a tendency to excite lustful thoughts\u201d was an example of material \u201cappealing to prurient interest.\u201d <em>Roth, </em>354 U.S. at 487 n. 20, 487, 77 S.Ct. at 1310 n. 20, 1310. Next the Court referred to the Webster\u2019s New International Dictionary (Unabridged, 2d ed., 1949), which defined \u201cprurient\u201d as \u201c[i]tching; longing; uneasy with desire or longing; of persons, having itching, morbid, or lascivious longings; of desire, curiosity, or propensity, lewd.... \u201d Ultimately, however, the Court concluded its analysis by stating that there was \u201cno significant difference between the meaning of obscenity developed in the case law and the definition of the A.L.I., Model Penal Code, \u00a7 207.10(2) (Tent. Draft No. 6, 1957).\u201d <em>Roth, </em>354 U.S. at 487 n. 20, 77 S.Ct. at 1310 n. 20. That section of the A.L.I.\u2019s Model Penal Code defined an item as obscene \u201cif, considered as a whole, its predominant appeal is to prurient interest, i.e., a shameful or morbid interest in nudity, sex, or excretion.... \u201d</p>\n<p id=\"b602-6\">Both the district court and defendants contend that <em>Roth\u2019s </em>definition of \u201cprurient interest\u201d included the concept of \u201clust.\u201d <em>See, e.g., Spokane Arcades, Inc. v. Eiken-berry, </em>544 F.Supp. at 1038 <em>(\u201cRoth </em>in actuality settled upon a shortened definition [of prurient interest], <em>i.e., </em>\u2018material having a tendency to incite lustful thoughts.\u2019 \u201d). Although there may be some initial appeal to this argument, we note that the discussion in <em>Roth </em>actually <em>concluded </em>with the A.L.I. Model Penal Code definition \u2014 one that defined a \u201cprurient interest\u201d as \u201cshameful or morbid\u201d and that did not include \u201clust\u201d either expressly or within the meaning of the words used in the definition. <em>See, e.g., Goldstein v. Allain, </em>568 F.Supp. 1377 (N.D. Miss.1983) <em>(\u201cRoth </em>and <em>Miller </em>attributed to the term \u2018prurient interest\u2019 a specific judicial meaning \u2014 that of a shameful and morbid interest in nudity, sex, or excretion.\u201d).</p>\n<p id=\"b602-8\">While we do not believe the Supreme Court intended in <em>Roth </em>to equate \u201clust\u201d with \u201cprurient interest,\u201d we also recognize that the meaning of words changes as a result of contemporary usage. Obscenity jurisprudence \u2014 based as it has been on contemporary community standards and changing social mores \u2014 is an extremely fluid area of law. <em>See, e.g., Red Bluff Drive-In, Inc. </em>v. <em>Vance, </em>648 F.2d 1020, 1029 n. 7 (5th Cir.1981), <em>cert. denied, </em>455 U.S. 913, 102 S.Ct. 1264, 71 L.Ed.2d 453 (1982). The connotations that accompanied the word \u201clust\u201d in 1957, when <em>Roth </em>was decided, are not necessarily the same ones that attach to the word today. For example, the most recent edition of Webster\u2019s New International Dictionary (Unabridged, 3d ed., 1976) no longer includes the word \u201clust\u201d in its definition of \u201cprurient.\u201d Indeed, the word has acquired such acceptable connotations that, prior to his election in 1976, presidential candidate Jimmy Carter confessed in a popular national publication that he had \u201clooked on a lot of women with lust [and] ... committed adultery in my heart many times.\u201d \u201cPlayboy Interview: Jimmy Carter,\u201d <em>Playboy, </em>Nov. 1976, at 86. We do not think that President Carter was describing a shameful or morbid interest; rather, he was obviously expressing a healthy, wholesome, human reaction common to millions of well-adjusted persons in our society. Certainly, we think it clear <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"491\">*491</page-number>that is how the country understood his remark, and how the term \u201clust\u201d is generally perceived today.</p>\n<p id=\"b603-5\">Court decisions since <em>Roth </em>have implicitly recognized the changing meanings of the words used to define obscenity. The <em>Miller </em>decision, which supplies the Supreme Court\u2019s most recent definition of obscenity, has replaced the definitions offered in <em>Roth. </em>In <em>Miller, </em>the Supreme Court makes no reference to the term \u201clust.\u201d To the contrary, the <em>Miller </em>Court refers <em>solely </em>to the definition of obscenity offered in the A.L. I.\u2019s 1962 Official Draft of the Model Penal Code. 413 U.S. 18 n. 2, 93 S.Ct. at 2612 n. 2. The section of the Code cited by the Court defines \u201cprurient interest\u201d as \u201ca shameful or morbid interest in nudity, sex or excretion.\u201d A.L.I. Model Penal Code \u00a7 251.4(1) \u201cObscene Defined.\u201d (Official Draft 1962). Other courts that have considered the issue have followed the Supreme Court\u2019s instructions in <em>Miller </em>and defined \u201cprurient interest\u201d as \u201cshameful or morbid\u201d and not as \u201clustful.\u201d <em>See, e.g., Red Bluff Drive-In, Inc. v. Vance, </em>648 F.2d at 1026;<footnotemark>8</footnotemark> <em>United States v. 85 MM.

American Booksellers Association, Inc., </em>582 S.W.2d 738, 749-50 (Tenn. 1979).</p>\n<p id=\"b603-6\">We agree with these decisions and reaffirm that, under the first prong of the <em>Miller </em>test, a \u201cprurient interest\u201d is \u201ca shameful or morbid interest in nudity, sex or excretion.\u201d By including \u201clust\u201d in its definition of \u201cprurient,\u201d the Washington state legislature has clearly exceeded the established \u2014 though sometimes blurred\u2014 boundaries drawn by the Supreme Court to distinguish protected first amendment expression from that which is obscene.</p>\n<p id=\"b603-10\">Indeed, to permit expression that merely excites \u201clust\u201d to be regulated by the state would destroy the boundaries between protected and unprotected speech. To the contemporary jury, \u201clust\u201d is unlikely to connote anything more than \u201csexual desire.\u201d <em>Webster\u2019s Third New International Dictionary </em>(Unabridged, 3d ed., 1976); <em>see also The Random House Dictionary of the English Language </em>(Unabridged, 1979) (\u201clust\u201d defined as \u201csexual desire or appetite\u201d). <em>See, e.g., Goldstein v. Allain, </em>568 F.Supp. 1377, at 1385 (N.D.Miss.1983) (\u201cThe inclusion of the terms lustful and erotic [in the Mississippi anti-obscenity, statute\u2019s definition of prurient interest] would permit the application of the statute to arguably protected materials. Such an intrusion into the area of protected speech is impermissible.\u201d). Expression that may merely stimulate sexual longing or desire is entitled to the full range of first amendment protections and cannot constitutionally be branded as obscene.<footnotemark>9</footnotemark></p>\n<p id=\"b603-11\">We agree with the Second Circuit\u2019s conclusion \u201cthat the Supreme Court has never <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"492\">*492</page-number>intended to brand as \u2018obscene\u2019 representations of sexual matters which do not import a debasing, \u2018shameful or morbid\u2019 quality into the expression or depiction of human sexuality. To conclude otherwise would be to suggest that the human body and its functions are in themselves somehow \u2018dirty\u2019 or unspeakably offensive.\u201d <em>United States v. 35 MM. Motion Picture Film Entitled \u201cLanguage of Love,\u201d </em>432 F.2d at 711.<footnotemark>10</footnotemark> Such an argument is degrading, and, like the Second Circuit, we reject it. In fact, if the arousal of good, old-fashioned, healthy lust \u201cis equated with an appeal to \u2018prurient interest,\u2019 it might be necessary to hale into court our leading couturiers, perfumers and manufacturers of soft drinks, soap suds and automobiles,\u201d 432 F.2d at 712, as well as mainstream stage, movie and television producers, directors and performers. Only by distinguishing between \u201cthe arousal of sexual instincts and the perversion of those instincts to morbidity,\u201d 432 F.2d at 712, can we ever hope to safeguard from state intrusion the already \u201cdim and uncertain\u201d boundary surrounding protected first amendment expression.</p>\n<p id=\"b604-4\">B.</p>\n<p id=\"b604-5\">As in all cases involving facial constitutional challenges to state statutes that have not yet been enforced or authoritatively interpreted, we must consider the possibility of a \u201creadily apparent construction [by a state court] ... as a vehicle for rehabilitating the statute[] in a single prosecution.\u201d <em>Dombrowski v. Pfister, </em>380 U.S. at 491, 85 S.Ct. at 1123. <em>See also Zwickler v. Koota, </em>389 U.S. at 251 n. 14, 88 S.Ct. at 397 n. 14 (\u201cthe state statute\u201d must be \u201cobviously susceptible of a limiting construction\u201d); <em>Harrison v. NAACP, </em>360 U.S. 167, 177, 79 S.Ct. 1025, 1030, 3 L.Ed.2d 1152 (1959); <em>Stoianoff v. Montana, </em>695 F.2d at 1218. If it were obvious from a reading of the statute that a state court could in a single prosecution properly construe the statute in a manner that would render it constitutional, our decision on plaintiffs\u2019 constitutional challenges would be \u201crendered] unnecessary,\u201d <em>Zwickler v. Koota, </em>389 U.S. at 250, 88 S.Ct. at 397, and we would dismiss plaintiffs\u2019 challenges. <em>Broadrick, </em>413 U.S. at 603, 617, 93 S.Ct. at 2911, 2918.</p>\n<p id=\"b604-10\">In this case, we find it crystal clear that the term \u201cprurient,\u201d as used in House Bill 626, includes \u201clust.\u201d It is not possible, under the statute, to give the term a contrary meaning. The statute expressly incorporates the term \u201clust\u201d in its definition of \u201cprurient.\u201d<footnotemark>11</footnotemark> Consequently, a state court <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"493\">*493</page-number>would either have to ignore the statutory definition completely or rewrite the statute in order to narrow its unconstitutional scope.</p>\n<p id=\"b605-6\">Since the state statute is not obviously susceptible to an interpretation that will avoid, the federal constitutional issue raised by plaintiffs, it is our duty to decide the constitutional question presented. <em>See, e.g., Zwickler </em>v. <em>Koota, </em>389 U.S. at 250-51, 88 S.Ct. at 396-97. <em>See also Aptheker v. Sec\u2019y of State, </em>378 U.S. 500, 515, 84 S.Ct. 1659, 1668, 12 L.Ed.2d 992 (1964) (statute held invalid because \u201c[t]he clarity and preciseness of the provision in question make it impossible to narrow its indiscriminately cast and overly broad scope without substantial rewriting.\u201d); <em>Red Bluff Drive-In, Inc. </em>v. Vance, 648 F.2d at 1029 (\u201cIf on its face the statute warned too broadly, deference to the state courts would be inappropriate.\u201d); <em>Turchick </em>v. <em>United States, </em>561 F.2d at 724 (\u201cwe need not rely on ... a saving construction because we believe the language of the statute is clear.\u201d). <em>Cf. Kunz v. New York, </em>340 U.S. 290, 304, 71 S.Ct. 312, 320, 95 L.Ed. 280 (1951) (Jackson, J., dissenting) (\u201cIt may happen that a statute will disclose by its very language that it is impossible of construction in a manner consistent with First Amendment rights.\u201d).</p>\n<p id=\"b605-7\">C.</p>\n<p id=\"b605-8\">Because the definition of obscenity in Washington\u2019s anti-obscenity statute unconstitutionally infringes on protected expression, the entire statute must be declared invalid. The application of both civil and criminal penalties under House Bill 626 depends upon a determination that the materials involved are legally obscene. Consequently, an unconstitutionally overbroad definition of obscenity renders House Bill 626 null and void.</p>\n<p id=\"b605-11\">II. <em>The Civil Fine Provisions of House Bill 626 Unconstitutionally Restrict Protected First Amendment Expression.</em></p>\n<p id=\"azq-dedup-1\">In view of the State of Washington\u2019s previous attempts to deal with obscenity and the fact that the legislature will undoubtedly try again, we believe it advisable to consider one of the other principal aspects of House Bill 626 challenged in these cases: the statute\u2019s civil fine provision. We consider this provision because it contains an obviously unconstitutional feature.<footnotemark>12</footnotemark></p>\n<p id=\"b605-12\">The civil penalty provision of House Bill 626 is set forth in section 4(2). Once it has been determined \u201cthat a defendant has with knowledge maintained a moral nuisance, the court shall impose a civil penalty and judgment of an amount as the court may determine to be appropriate. In imposing the civil penalty, the court shall consider the wilfullness of the defendant\u2019s conduct and the profits made by the defendant attributable to the moral nuisance.\u201d Unlike the general nuisance statute, <em>Wash.Rev.Code Ann., </em>\u00a7 7.48.250 (1961, 1983 Supp.), there is no limit in House Bill 626 on the amount of the civil fine that may be assessed.</p>\n<p id=\"b605-13\">Plaintiffs challenge the civil penalty provision on a variety of grounds. The one we consider here relates to the requirement that a court must take into account \u201cthe profits made by the defendant attributable to the moral nuisance\u201d when setting the amount of the civil fine. The statute defines a \u201cmoral nuisance,\u201d in three of four instances, as a \u201cplace\u201d where obscene mate<page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"494\">*494</page-number>rials or behavior may be found.<footnotemark>13</footnotemark> Thus, the civil fine, which is premised in part on profits \u201cattributable to the moral nuisance,\u201d may be based on profits from the <em>sale of protected materials </em>in a place that is a moral nuisance solely because obscene materials were also sold or exhibited there. For example, the statute would allow a theater owner who sold $1,000,000 worth of admissions to constitutionally protected films and only $100,000 worth of admissions to films judged legally obscene<footnotemark>14</footnotemark> to be fined on the basis of admissions to all of the films shown. Moreover, the amount of profits from the operation of the entire business is one of only two factors that a judge <em>must </em>consider when setting a civil fine.</p>\n<p id=\"b606-4\">The procedure for determining civil fines set forth in House Bill 626 is, in our view, unconstitutional. We hold that it is impermissible, in an anti-obscenity statute, to provide that the amount of a fine shall be based, even in part, on the proceeds from constitutionally protected material.</p>\n<p id=\"b606-5\">We do not question the State of Washington\u2019s right to regulate certain nuisances within its boundaries; what we are concerned with is \u201cthe consequences for constitutionally protected speech\u201d in the State\u2019s efforts. <em>Marcus v. A Search Warrant of Property, </em>367 U.S. 717, 731, 81 S.Ct. 1708, 1716, 6 L.Ed.2d 1127 (1961). Consequently, we apply the familiar requirement that statutes punishing expressive conduct \u201cmust be carefully drawn ... to punish only unprotected speech and not be susceptible of application to protected expression.\u201d <em>Gooding v. Wilson, </em>405 U.S. 518, 522, 92 S.Ct. 1103, 1106, 31 L.Ed.2d 408 (1972). The civil fine provision of House Bill 626 does not satisfy this requirement.</p>\n<p id=\"b606-11\">Far from being narrowly tailored to the achievement of a permissible state goal, the civil fine provision \u201csweep[s] unnecessarily broadly and thereby invade[s] the area of protected freedoms.\u201d <em>NAACP </em>v. <em>Alabama ex rel. Flowers, </em>377 U.S. 288, 307, 84 S.Ct. 1302, 1314, 12 L.Ed.2d 325 (1964). By focusing on the place where the obscene materials are sold or exhibited rather than the unprotected materials themselves, the civil fine provision endangers protected speech. Courts that have addressed similar issues have held that abatement of a moral nuisance \u201cmust be directed to the particular books or films which have been adjudged obscene following a fair and full adversary hearing rather than against the premises in which the material is sold, exhibited, or displayed.\u201d <em>People ex rel. Busch v. Projection Room Theater, </em>17 Cal.3d 42, 56, 130 Cal.Rptr. 328, 338, 550 P.2d 600, 610, <em>cert. denied, </em>429 U.S. 922, 97 S.Ct. 320, 50 L.Ed.2d 289 (1976). A contrary result would allow the government to punish protected first amendment expression simply because obscene speech was also disseminated from the same place.</p>\n<p id=\"b606-12\">In fact, the civil fine provision of House Bill 626 is similar in one important respect to the so-called anti-obscenity \u201cpadlocking statutes\u201d. These padlocking statutes typically provide for the closure of a place of business after a judicial determination that obscene materials have been disseminated from that location. They have consistently been declared unconstitutional because they constitute impermissible prior restraints on <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"495\">*495</page-number>free expression. <em>See, e.g., Universal Amusement Co., Inc. v. Vance, </em>587 F.2d 159, 164-66 (5th Cir.1978) (en banc), and cases cited therein, <em>affd, </em>445 U.S. 308, 100 S.Ct. 1156, 63 L.Ed.2d 413 (1980); <em>People ex rel. Busch v. Projection Room Theater, </em>17 Cal.3d at 42, 130 Cal.Rptr. 328, 550 P.2d 600; <em>General Corp. v. State ex rel. Sweeton, </em>294 Ala. 657, 320 So.2d 668 (1975), <em>cert. denied, </em>425 U.S. 904, 96 S.Ct. 1494, 47 L.Ed.2d 753 (1976); <em>Sanders v. State, </em>231 Ga. 608, 203 S.E.2d 153 (1974); <em>Gulf States Theaters of Louisiana, Inc. v. Richardson, </em>287 So.2d 480 (La.1973); <em>State ex rel. Andrews v. Chateau X, Inc., </em>296 N.C. 251, 250 S.E.2d 603 (1979), <em>vacated on other grounds, </em>445 U.S. 947, 100 S.Ct. 1593, 63 L.Ed.2d 782 (1980); <em>Mitchem v. State ex rel. Schaub, </em>250 So.2d 883 (Fla.1971); <em>New Riviera Arts Theatre v. State ex rel. Davis, </em>219 Tenn. 652, 412 S.W.2d 890 (1967); <em>State v. A Motion Picture Entitled \u201cThe Bet,\" </em>219 Kan. 64, 547 P.2d 760 (1976). Of course, the familiar presumption against prior restraints constitutes the principal rationale for these decisions. <em>See, e.g., Near v. Minnesota, </em>283 U.S. 697, 711-15, 51 S.Ct. 625, 629-30, 75 L.Ed. 1357 (1931); <em>Bantam Books, Inc. v. Sullivan, </em>372 U.S. at 70-71, 83 S.Ct. at 639-640. We also think it crucial, however, that the padlocking statutes have the effect of preventing the dissemination of protected speech simply because obscene speech originated from the same location. In our view, the civil fine provision of House Bill 626 \u2014 which prescribes punishment based on the profits from protected materials that were sold or exhibited in the same place as obscene materials \u2014 is no less objectionable. It may be argued that the protected speech is not being punished but that it only serves as a measure of the appropriate punishment. Such an argument is not persuasive. The crucial point is that free speech is far too sensitive a subject matter to serve as the measurement for civil or criminal penalties.</p>\n<p id=\"b607-5\">Moreover, it appears that the civil fine provision of House Bill 626 treats businesses disseminating both protected and unprotected speech differently from the way other businesses are treated under other statutes imposing civil fines. Defendants do not point to any other Washington State statutes that base the amounts of fines on the profits from an entire business when only a part of that business is unlawful. Although we have not conducted an independent analysis of the entire body of Washington law, our sampling of various civil fine provisions has revealed no provision similar to that contained in House Bill 626. To the contrary, the statutes we have examined, including Washington\u2019s general nuisance statute, <em>Wash.Rev.Code Ann., </em>\u00a7 7.48.250 (1961; 1983 Supp.), merely establish the minimum and maximum amounts of civil penalties.</p>\n<p id=\"b607-7\">Differential treatment of first amendment activity with respect to the imposition of fines is prohibited by the Constitution. In <em>Minneapolis Star &amp; Tribune Co. v. Minnesota Commissioner of </em>Revenue, \u2014 U.S. \u2014, 103 S.Ct. 1365, 1375, 75 L.Ed.2d 295 (1983) the Supreme Court struck down a state use tax that provided for differential treatment of the press. As the Court emphasized, \u201cdifferential treatment, unless justified by some special characteristic of the press, suggests that the goal of the regulation is not unrelated to suppression of expression, and such a goal is presumptively unconstitutional.\u201d <em>Id. </em>at 1372. The Court\u2019s reasoning is as applicable to fines as taxes.</p>\n<p id=\"b607-11\">The basing of fines on profits from the sale or exhibition of constitutionally protected materials is unnecessary to the achievement of any legitimate state goal. Thus, the presumption of unconstitutionality cannot be rebutted here. <em>See, e.g, Minneapolis Star &amp; Tribune Co., </em>103 S.Ct. at 1372 (differential taxation of first amendment businesses is unconstitutional \u201cunless the State asserts a counterbalancing interest of compelling importance that it cannot achieve without differential taxation.\u201d). In support of our conclusion, we note that in the criminal penalty provision of House Bill 626, the Washington legislature authorized monetary sanctions based <em>solely </em>on profits from the sale of constitutionally unprotected materials. The criminal penalty provision requires the court to <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"496\">*496</page-number>consider \u201cthe profits made by the defendant attributable to the felony,\u201d with the felony defined as the promotion of pornography. It is therefore evident that in enacting the civil fine provision, the State of Washington could have achieved its legislative goals by more carefully tailored means that would be less restrictive of free expression. <em>See, e.g., Shelton v. Tucker, </em>364 U.S. 479, 81 S.Ct. 247, 5 L.Ed.2d 231 (1960).</p>\n<p id=\"b608-4\">We do not see any readily apparent construction that could save the civil fine provision. <em>See supra, </em>725 F.2d at 494. As with the statute\u2019s definition of \u201cprurient,\u201d state courts would have to ignore or rewrite the explicit language of the provision in order to salvage House Bill 626. Consequently, we find that the civil fines section of the Washington anti-obscenity law is unconstitutional.</p>\n<p id=\"b608-5\">CONCLUSION</p>\n<p id=\"b608-6\">The Washington state anti-obscenity statute adopts an unconstitutionally broad definition of obscenity. We must therefore hold the statute unconstitutional. We also hold that the statute\u2019s civil fines provision impermissibly restricts protected speech.</p>\n<p id=\"b608-7\">REVERSED.</p>\n<p id=\"b608-8\">APPENDIX</p>\n<p id=\"b608-9\">House Bill 626 provides, in relevant part:</p>\n<p id=\"b608-10\">Section 1. The definitions set forth in this section shall apply throughout this chapter.</p>\n<p id=\"b608-11\">(1) \u201cKnowledge\u201d or \u201cknowledge of such nuisance\u201d means having knowledge of the contents and character of the patently offensive sexual or violent conduct which appears in the lewd matter, or knowledge of the acts of lewdness or prostitution which occur on the premises.</p>\n<p id=\"b608-12\">(2) \u201cLewd matter\u201d is synonymous with \u201cobscene matter\u201d and means any matter:</p>\n<p id=\"b608-13\">(a) Which the average person, applying contemporary community standards, would find, when considered as a whole, appeals to the prurient interest; and</p>\n<p id=\"b608-14\">(b) Which explicitly depicts or describes patently offensive representations or descriptions of:</p>\n<p id=\"b608-15\">(i) Ultimate sexual acts, normal or perverted, actual or simulated; or</p>\n<p id=\"b608-16\">(ii) Masturbation, fellatio, cunnilingus, bestiality, excretory functions, or lewd exhibition of the genitals or genital area; or</p>\n<p id=\"b608-17\">(iii) Violent or destructive sexual acts, including but not limited to human or animal mutilation, dismemberment, rape or torture; and</p>\n<p id=\"b608-18\">(c) Which, when considered as a whole, and in the context in which it is used, lacks serious literary, artistic, political, or scientific value.</p>\n<p id=\"b608-19\">(3) \u201cLewdness\u201d shall have and include all those meanings which are assigned to it under the common law.</p>\n<p id=\"b608-20\">(4) \u201cMatter\u201d shall mean a motion picture film or a publication or both.</p>\n<p id=\"b608-21\">(5) \u201cMotion picture film\u201d shall include any:</p>\n<p id=\"b608-22\">(a) Film or plate negative;</p>\n<p id=\"b608-23\">(b) Film or plate positive;</p>\n<p id=\"b608-24\">(c) Film designed to be projected on a screen for exhibition;</p>\n<p id=\"b608-25\">(d) Film, glass slides, or transparencies, either in negative or positive form, designed for exhibition by projection on a screen;</p>\n<p id=\"b608-26\">(e) Video tape or any other medium used to electronically reproduce images on a screen.</p>\n<p id=\"b608-27\">(6) \u201cPerson\u201d means any individual, partnership, firm, association, corporation, or other legal entity.</p>\n<p id=\"b608-28\">(7) \u201cPlace\u201d includes, but is not limited to, any building, structure, or places, or any separate part or portion thereof, whether permanent or not, or the ground itself.</p>\n<p id=\"b608-29\">(8) \u201cPrurient\u201d means that which incites lasciviousness or lust.</p>\n<p id=\"b608-30\">(9) \u201cPublication\u201d shall include any book, magazine, article, pamphlet, writing, printing, illustration, picture, sound recording, or coin-operated machine.</p>\n<p id=\"b608-31\">(10) \u201cSale\u201d means a passing of title or right of possession from a seller to a buyer <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"497\">*497</page-number>for valuable consideration, and shall include, but is not limited to, any lease or rental arrangement or other transaction wherein or whereby any valuable consideration is received for the use of, or transfer of possession of, lewd matter.</p>\n<p id=\"b609-5\">Section 2. The following are declared to be moral nuisances:</p>\n<p id=\"b609-6\">(1) Any and every place in the state where lewd films are publicly exhibited as a regular course of business, or possessed for the purpose of such exhibition;</p>\n<p id=\"b609-7\">(2) Any and every lewd film which is publicly exhibited, or possessed for such purpose at a place which is a moral nuisance under this section;</p>\n<p id=\"b609-8\">(3) Any and every place of business in the state in which lewd publications constitute a principal part of the stock in trade;</p>\n<p id=\"b609-9\">(4) Every place which, as a regular course of business, is used for the purpose of lewdness or prostitution, and every such place in or upon which acts of lewdness or prostitution are conducted permitted, carried on, continued, or exist.</p>\n<p id=\"b609-10\">Section 3. Any of the following parties may bring a civil action in the superior court of any county where a moral nuisance is alleged to have been maintained:</p>\n<p id=\"b609-11\">(1) The prosecuting attorney for the county where the alleged moral nuisance is located;</p>\n<p id=\"b609-12\">(2) The city attorney for the city where the alleged moral nuisance is located; or</p>\n<p id=\"b609-13\">(3) The attorney general.</p>\n<p id=\"b609-14\">The rules of evidence, burden of proof, and all other rules of court shall be the court rules generally applicable to civil cases in this state: PROVIDED, That the standard of proof on the issue of obscenity shall be clear, cogent, and convincing evidence.</p>\n<p id=\"b609-15\">Section 4. (1) No person shall with knowledge maintain a moral nuisance.</p>\n<p id=\"b609-16\">(2) Upon a determination that a defendant has with knowledge maintained a moral nuisance, the court shall impose a civil penalty and judgment of an amount as the court may determine to be appropriate. In imposing the civil penalty, the court shall consider the wilfulness of the defendant\u2019s conduct and the profits made by the defendant attributable to the moral nuisance.</p>\n<p id=\"b609-18\">Section 5. All civil penalties assessed under section 4 of this act shall be paid into the general treasury of the governmental unit commencing the civil action.</p>\n<p id=\"b609-19\">Section 6. Nothing in this chapter applies to the circulation of any material by any recognized historical society or museum, any library of any college or university, or to any archive or library under the supervision and control of the state, county, municipality, or other political subdivision.</p>\n<p id=\"b609-20\">Section 7. Sections 1 through 6 of this act shall constitute a new chapter in Title 7 RCW.</p>\n<p id=\"b609-21\">Section 8. There is added to chapter 9.68 RCW a new section to read as follows:</p>\n<p id=\"b609-22\">A person who, for profit-making purposes and with knowledge, sells, exhibits, displays, or produces any lewd matter as defined in section 1 of this act is guilty of promoting pornography. Promoting pornography is a class C felony and shall bear the punishment prescribed for that class of felony, except that upon conviction of promoting pornography the court shall impose a fine of not less than five thousand dollars per count nor more than fifty thousand dollars per count. In imposing the criminal penalty, the court shall consider the wilfulness of the defendant\u2019s conduct and the profits made by the defendant attributable to the felony. All fines assessed under this chapter shall be paid into the general treasury of the state.</p>\n<p id=\"b609-23\">Section 9. If any provision of this act or its application to any person or circumstance is held invalid, the remainder of the act or the application of the provision to other persons or circumstances is not affected.</p>\n<p id=\"b609-24\">Section 10. This act is necessary for the immediate preservation of the public peace, health, and safety, the support of the state government and its existing public institutions, and shall take effect immediately.</p>\n<footnote label=\"1\">\n<p id=\"b596-17\">. The relevant portions of House Bill 626 are reprinted in the Appendix to this opinion.</p>\n</footnote>\n<footnote label=\"2\">\n<p id=\"b597-6\">. Throughout these proceedings, various objections have been raised to the standing of a few of the many plaintiffs in the seven consolidated cases. <em>See, e.g., Spokane Arcades, Inc. </em>v. <em>Eikenberry, </em>544 F.Supp. 1034, 1037 n. 1 (E.D. Wash. 1982). In particular, the standing of the American Civil Liberties Union as a plaintiff in one of the cases has been challenged before this Court. The district court\u2019s opinion was that \u201c[i]n view of the disposition of this matter,</p>\n<p id=\"b597-7\">... the question is largely academic.\u201d <em>Id. </em>We share that view. <em>See generally Havens Realty Corp. v. Coleman, </em>455 U.S. 363, 102 S.Ct. 1114, 71 L.Ed.2d 214 (1982), <em>quoting Taggart v. Weinacker\u2019s, Inc., </em>397 U.S. 223, 225, 90 S.Ct. 876, 877, 25 L.Ed.2d 240 (1970) (per curiam); <em>Bullock </em>v. <em>Carter, </em>405 U.S. 134, 92 S.Ct. 849, 31 L.Ed.2d 92 (1972); <em>Gulf Oil Co. v. Federal Regulatory Commission, </em>706 F.2d 444 (3d Cir. 1983).</p>\n<p id=\"b597-8\">It is worth noting however, that the ACLU has standing to sue in this case if any one of its members suffers or is threatened with injuries that would create a justiciable case. <em>See generally Warth v. Seldin, </em>422 U.S. 490, 95 S.Ct. 2197, 45 L.Ed.2d 343 (1975); <em>Black Faculty Association v. San Diego Community College, </em>664 F.2d 1153 (9th Cir.1981). Because we find that House Bill 626 is unconstitutionally over-broad, it seems likely that some of the ACLU\u2019s members would be affected by the statute\u2019s impermissible restrictions on protected speech.</p>\n</footnote>\n<footnote label=\"3\">\n<p id=\"b597-9\">. King County Prosecuting Attorney Norm Maleng, a defendant to two of the suits being appealed, raises several objections to the district court\u2019s assertion of jurisdiction over him. First, Maleng argues that venue in the <em>Kukio Bay Properties </em>case was improperly transferred from the Western District of Washington, where Maleng performs his official duties, to the Eastern District of Washington, where the various other lawsuits were filed. <em>See </em>28 U.S.C. \u00a7 1404(a) (1976). We disagree. The <em>forum non conveniens </em>determination is committed to the sound discretion of the trial court. We will reverse such a determination only when there has been an abuse of discretion. <em>See, e.g., Piper Aircraft Co. v. Reyno, </em>454 U.S. 235, 102 S.Ct. 252, 70 L.Ed.2d 419 (1981). See <em>also Norwood v. Kirkpatrick, </em>349 U.S. 29, 31-32, 75 S.Ct. 544, 546-547, 99 L.Ed. 789 (1955) (trial court has more discretion to transfer to another federal court pursuant to \u00a7 1404(a) than to dismiss on grounds of <em>forum non conveniens). </em>In this case, the district judge for the Western District of Washington correctly found \u201cthat the interests of the parties, convenience to the attorneys, judicial economy, and the public interest are all served by disposing of this matter in one hearing\u201d already scheduled in the Eastern District of Washington.</p>\n<p id=\"b597-14\">Second, Maleng contends that the plaintiff in the <em>Playtime Theaters </em>suit owns no theaters or bookstores in King County and thus could not possibly be subject to prosecution by him. In its brief to this court, however, Playtime Theaters, Inc. asserts that it \u201cis a body corporate of the state of Washington operating 35 mm. motion picture theaters in various counties in the State of Washington exhibiting adult film fare to the adult citizens of and/or visitors to the State of Washington.\u201d King County is not, however, specifically mentioned as one of these counties. The trial judge, after \u201cbeing fully appraised of the parties\u2019 respective positions,\u201d ordered that Playtime \u201cbe granted leave to amend its complaint only to the extent necessary to join Norm Maleng ... as an additional defendant.\u201d In light of our resolution of this case, we see no present need to decide this factual dispute.</p>\n</footnote>\n<footnote label=\"4\">\n<p id=\"b598-8\">. Under Section Three of the statute, enforcement proceedings may be initiated by the \u201cprosecuting attorney for the county where the alleged moral nuisance is located,\u201d by the \u201ccity attorney for the city where the alleged moral nuisance is located,\u201d or by the state attorney general.</p>\n</footnote>\n<footnote label=\"5\">\n<p id=\"b599-9\">. In evaluating a facial challenge, we must also consider whether there are any readily apparent constructions capable of saving the statute, in a single state prosecution, from plaintiffs\u2019 constitutional challenges. We discuss this requirement later. <em>See infra, </em>725 F.2d at pp. 488, 489.</p>\n</footnote>\n<footnote label=\"6\">\n<p id=\"b600-5\">. None of the other traditional grounds for abstention is applicable in this case. Under the <em>Burford </em>doctrine, <em>Burford v. Sun Oil Co., </em>319 U.S. 315, 63 S.Ct. 1098, 87 L.Ed. 1424 (1943), federal courts may decline to exercise jurisdiction when the case involves \u201can essentially local issue arising out of a complicated state regulatory scheme.\u201d <em>International Bhd. of Electrical Workers, Local Union No. 1245 v. Public Serv. Comm\u2019n, </em>614 F.2d 206, 211 (9th Cir.1980). We have traditionally applied the <em>Burford </em>doctrine to cases where suits involving the local issue have been concentrated in an individual state court and where the federal issues are inextricably bound up with state issues \u2022 which state courts may be especially competent to deal with. <em>International Bhd., </em>614 F.2d at 211. Neither of these circumstances is likely to exist in a case involving a first <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"489\">*489</page-number>amendment challenge to a state statute, and neither circumstance applies in this case.</p>\n<p id=\"b601-13\">Abstention may also be appropriate in certain instances when a federal suit seeks to enjoin a pending or ongoing state proceeding in which federal claims could be adjudicated competently. <em>See, e.g., Younger v. Harris, </em>401 U.S. 37, 91 S.Ct. 746, 27 L.Ed.2d 669 (1971); <em>Moore v. Sims, </em>442 U.S. 415, 423, 425, 99 S.Ct. 2371, 2377, 2378, 60 L.Ed.2d 994 (1979); <em>L.H. v. Ja-mieson, </em>643 F.2d 1351, 1352 (9th Cir.1981). It is not necessary to decide whether this is the type of case in which <em>Younger </em>abstention might otherwise be appropriate because, as the State notes, \u201c[n]o one has been prosecuted [and] no civil actions have been filed\u201d pursuant to House Bill 626. <em>See supra, </em>725 F.2d at 487.</p>\n</footnote>\n<footnote label=\"7\">\n<p id=\"b601-16\">. <em>See also Leech v. American Booksellers Ass\u2019n, Inc., </em>582 S.W.2d 738, 745 (Tenn.1979) (a court \u201ccannot give constitutional approval to any law expanding the standards for adjudicating obscenity, <em>vel non, </em>beyond the dictates of <em>Miller </em>and its progeny.\u201d); <em>State v. Princess Cinema of Milwaukee, </em>96 Wis.2d 646, 292 N.W.2d 807, 808, 811 (1980) (it was error for a court to \u201cdeviate[ ] from the <em>Miller v. California </em>standards.\u201d); <em>D &amp; J Enterprises, Inc. v. Mi-chaelson, </em>401 A.2d 440, 442, 446 (R.I.1979) (\u201c[T]he <em>Miller </em>Court set out a new framework of revised standards to guide the states in separating what is obscene ... from what is not obscene .... [Because t]he act fails to meet the <em>Miller </em>blueprint, [it] must be stricken as constitutionally overbroad.\u201d).</p>\n</footnote>\n<footnote label=\"8\">\n<p id=\"b603-7\">. In <em>Red Bluff, </em>the Fifth Circuit held that \u201cthe lack of a definition for the term \u2018prurient interest\u2019 does not render the [Texas obscenity] statute constitutionally deficient.\u201d 648 F.2d at 1026. Defendants argue that <em>Red Bluff </em>is dis-positive here. We disagree. <em>Red Bluff </em>involved a statute that recited, \u201cwith little variation, the familiar three-part <em>Miller </em>test\u201d for obscenity. 648 F.2d at 1026. The statute included the term \u201cprurient interest,\u201d although no definition was offered. The Fifth Circuit found that a specific provision in Texas law required courts construing the term \u201cto apply any \u2018technical or particular meaning\u2019 the term has acquired from prior judicial review.\u201d 648 F.2d at 1026 (citations omitted). Thus, <em>Red </em>Bluff involved a statute that adopted the <em>Miller </em>test exactly but contained <em>no definition whatsoever </em>of \u201cprurient interest;\u201d the proper and constitutional definition was supplied by operation of law. In the case before us, House Bill 626 contains a very explicit definition of \u201cprurient\u201d \u2014one that expressly incorporates an overbroad and unconstitutional definition of that term.</p>\n</footnote>\n<footnote label=\"9\">\n<p id=\"b603-13\">. The dissent\u2019s reliance on the Supreme Court\u2019s order of dismissal in <em>Art Theatre Guild, Inc. v. Ewing, </em>421 U.S. 923, 95 S.Ct. 1649, 44 L.Ed.2d 82 (1975) is misplaced. A review of the papers submitted to the Court by the parties reveals that neither the appellant nor the appellee even mentioned the Ohio statute\u2019s inclusion of the term \u201clust.\u201d Similarly, there is no indication in the Ohio Supreme Court\u2019s opinion in the underlying case that the \u201clust\u201d issue was ever raised before that court. <em>State v. A Motion Picture Film Entitled \u201cWithout a Stitch,\u201d </em>37 Ohio St.2d 95, 307 N.E.2d 911 (1974).</p>\n</footnote>\n<footnote label=\"10\">\n<p id=\"b604-6\">. This Second Circuit decision involved an obscenity challenge to a motion picture called \u201cLanguage of Love.\u201d Even though \u201c[t]o the average person ... certain scenes in \u2018Language of Love\u2019 may present a temporary erotic appeal, and the effect may be temporary sexual arousal,\u201d 432 F.2d at 711-12, the Second Circuit found that the film did not appeal to the prurient interest and thus was not obscene.</p>\n</footnote>\n<footnote label=\"11\">\n<p id=\"b604-7\">. The district court agreed with defendants\u2019 argument that \u00a7 1(8) of House Bill 626 defines only the word \u201cprurient\u201d and not the term \u201cprurient interest.\u201d Consequently, defendants contend that \u00a7 1(2) \u2014 which incorporates the <em>Miller </em>test, including the term \u201cprurient interest\u201d \u2014 can be read independently of the definition of \u201cprurient\u201d in \u00a7 1(8). <em>See, e.g., Spokane Arcades, Inc. v. Eikenberry, </em>544 F.Supp. at 1038-39. If this is the case, defendants argue, the term \u201cprurient interest\u201d can be given its recognized judicial meaning and the word \u201clust\u201d in \u00a7 1(8) can be ignored.</p>\n<p id=\"b604-8\">We find this interpretation of House Bill 626 to be completely implausible. To begin with, the word \u201cprurient\u201d is used only twice in the statute: in \u00a7 1(8), where it is defined, and in \u00a7 l(2)(a), where it is part of the phrase \u201cprurient interest.\u201d It would have made no sense for the framers of House Bill 626 to define \u201cprurient\u201d and then never to use the word in the statute. Thus, the only reasonable conclusion is that the definition of \u201cprurient\u201d in \u00a7 1(8) is intended to refer to the use of that word the only other time it appears in the statute, in \u00a7 l(2)(a). This is also the only conclusion that avoids the untenable result of rendering a portion of the statute \u2014 the definition of \u201cprurient\u201d in \u00a7 1(8) \u2014 completely irrelevant and superfluous.</p>\n<p id=\"b604-12\">In addition, the introduction to \u00a7 1 of House Bill 626 explicitly commands that \u201c[t]he definitions set forth in this section shall apply throughout\u201d the entire statute. It makes little sense to argue, then, that a definition of a word provided in \u00a7 1(8) does not apply when the same word is used in \u00a7 l(2)(a). In fact, the other definitions offered in \u00a7 1(3) &amp; (4) also refer to words used in the statute\u2019s definition of <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"493\">*493</page-number>obscenlty in \u00a7 1(2). We thus reject as utterly without merit defendants\u2019 alternative reading of House BUI 626.</p>\n</footnote>\n<footnote label=\"12\">\n<p id=\"b605-10\">. Our discussion of one aspect of the civil fine provision, and our faUure to discuss other important issues, should not be read as intimating any view on the remaining constitutional challenges raised by plaintiffs. We do not here consider plaintiffs\u2019 other complaints regarding the dual civil-criminal fine system. In particular, we express no opinion on plaintiffs\u2019 other first amendment and eighth amendment challenges to the statute\u2019s civil and criminal penalty provisions. Nor do we indicate any view on the district court\u2019s two-fold decision that (a) the Constitution requires a jury trial in obscenity cases when civil fines are imposed, and (b) the federal courts need not now determine whether persons against whom such fines are sought would be afforded the right to a jury under Washington law. <em>See Spokane Arcades, Inc. v.

United States, </em>354 U.S. 476, 486, 487 n. 20, 77 S.Ct. 1304, 1310 n. 20, 1 L.Ed.2d 1498 (1957) <em>(Roth), </em>used the word \u201clust\u201d to help define prurient interest.. The majority concludes that \u201c[t]he application of both civil and criminal penalties under House Bill 626 depends on a determination that the materials involved are legally obscene. Consequently, an unconstitutionally overbroad definition of obscenity renders House Bill 626 null and void.\u201d Despite having done all it may do as a court, however, the majority goes on to assert that \u201cbecause the legislature will undoubtedly try again, we believe it advisable to discuss ... the statute\u2019s civil fine provision .... because it contains an obviously unconstitutional feature.\u201d</p>\n<p id=\"b610-6\">What follows that statement is merely advisory. Were it a holding, I would concur: the civil fine provision is overbroad and incapable of a saving construction. Even the majority\u2019s prior restraint argument would have force on this issue. <em>See, e.g., </em>Jeffries, <em>Rethinking Prior Restraint, </em>92 Yale L.J. 409, 412 (1983); <em>see generally Vance v. Universal Amusement Co., </em>445 U.S. 308, 100 S.Ct. 1156, 63 L.Ed.2d 413 (1980). But neither this advice to the state legislature, nor the discussion of it, amounts to an alternative holding. The actual holding of the majority strikes down the whole House Bill 626. The majority\u2019s dicta would not reach a similar conclusion; instead, it would strike down only a portion of the statutory scheme, leaving the rest intact. In that sense it is not an alternative way of reaching a result, but an answer to a different, and lesser, question. An outcome-determinative test shows the majority\u2019s conclusion about the unconstitutionality of the civil fines cannot be a true alternative holding. Had the majority correctly decided that the mere use of \u201clust\u201d is not facially overbroad, the remaining \u201calternative holding\u201d would not allow the appeal to come out the same way on the validity of the statute as a whole. <em>See </em>Lucas, <em>The Direct and Collateral Estoppel Effects of Alternative Holdings, </em>50 U.Chi.L.Rev. 701, 703 (1983). Because the civil fine discussion is dictum, I do not vote upon it. I do dissent, however, from the part of the majority opinion that is a holding.</p>\n<p id=\"b610-8\">The current limits on obscenity legislation, state or federal, appear generally in <em>Miller v. California, </em>413 U.S. 15, 93 S.Ct. 2607, 37 L.Ed.2d 419 (1973) <em>(Miller). </em>That case did not reject all that had gone before, or limit scripturally all that would come after. <em>See, e.g., id. </em>at 24 n. 6, 93 S.Ct. at 2615 n. 6. In explaining the term \u201cobscene material,\u201d <em>Miller </em>affirmed that the words \u201chave a specific judicial meaning which derives from the <em>Roth </em>case, <em>i.e., </em>obscene material \u2018which deals with sex.\u2019 <em>Roth, supra, </em>[354 U.S.] at 487 [77 S.Ct. at 1310]. See also ALI Model Penal Code \u00a7 251.4(1) \u2018Obscene Defined.\u2019 (Official Draft 1962).\u201d <em>Miller, </em>413 U.S. at 18 n. 2, 93 S.Ct. at 2612 n. 2. The Court\u2019s opinion, <em>id. </em>at 24, 93 S.Ct. at 2614, also looked back to <em>Roth </em>for help in defining the permissible scope for state regulation of obscene material: \u201cwhether \u2018the average person, applying contemporary community standards,\u2019 would find that the work, taken as a whole, appeals to the prurient interest, <em>Kois </em>v. <em>Wisconsin, supra </em>[408 U.S. 229], at 230 [92 S.Ct. 2245, at 2246, 33 L.Ed.2d 312], quoting <em>Roth </em>v. <em>United States, supra, </em>[354 U.S.], at 489 [77 S.Ct. at 1311].\u201d</p>\n<p id=\"b610-9\">In reaffirming that the first amendment does not protect obscene material, <em>Miller </em>clearly indicates that <em>Roth </em>provides the chief source for understanding \u201cprurient interest.\u201d Only in <em>Roth, </em>and in no other opinion, did the Court explain the term:</p>\n<blockquote id=\"b610-10\">Obscene material is material which deals with sex in a manner appealing to prurient interest.<footnotemark>20</footnotemark></blockquote>\n<p id=\"b611-10\"><page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"499\">*499</page-number>354 U.S. at 487 &amp; n. 20, 77 S.Ct. at 1310 &amp; n. 20 (emphasis added).</p>\n<p id=\"b611-11\">It is thus clear in <em>Roth, </em>unchanged by <em>Miller, </em>that \u201clustful thoughts\u201d can be a part of the \u201cprurient interest\u201d definition. The majority would eliminate that part of <em>Roth </em>in order to arrive at its conclusion that the State of Washington may not constitutionally include \u201clust\u201d as even a part of its definition.</p>\n<p id=\"b611-12\">First, the majority argues that the direct citation to \u201clustful thoughts\u201d means nothing because the <em>Roth </em>footnote ends by citing the Model Penal Code. But why? Would not the reverse of this argument make as much sense: because the Court begins by citing \u201clustful thoughts,\u201d the rest of the footnote means nothing?</p>\n<p id=\"b611-13\">The better interpretation is to read the footnote as a whole. Indeed, as the Court\u2019s reference in the footnote to \u201cno significant difference in meaning\u201d hints, the footnote catalogues different ways to describe the same concept. The reference to lust describes prurient interest as much as does the reference to the Model Penal Code. <em>See, e.g., </em>Feinberg, <em>Pornography and the Criminal Law, </em>40 U.Pitt.L.Rev. 567, 585 (1979) (interpreting obscenity in <em>Roth </em>with reference to the \u201cappeal to prurient interest\u201d clause: obscenity means \u201cwhatever is produced for the sole purpose of arousing lustful thoughts .... \u201d).</p>\n<p id=\"b611-15\">No doubt the Supreme Court has often addressed the Model Penal Code\u2019s definition of prurient interest because states have often enacted it. <em>See, e.g, Ward v. Illinois, </em>431 U.S. 767, 771, 97 S.Ct. 2085, 2088, 52 L.Ed.2d 738 (1977) (Ill.Rev.Stat. c. 38, \u00a7 11-20(b)); <em>S.S. &amp; W., Inc. v. Kansas City, </em>421 U.S. 925, 925, 95 S.Ct. 1650, 1650, 44 L.Ed.2d 83 (1975) (Kansas City Ord. \u00a7 26.-141) (Brennan, J., dissenting from dismissal of the appeal for want of a substantial federal question); <em>Jenkins v. Georgia, </em>418 U.S. 153, 154-55, 94 S.Ct. 2750, 2752, 41 L.Ed.2d 642 (1974) (Ga.Code Ann. \u00a7 26-2101); <em>Paris Adult Theatre I v. Slaton, </em>413 U.S. 49, 51 n. 1, 93 S.Ct. 2628, 2632 n. 1, 37 L.Ed.2d 446 (1973) (Ga.Code Ann. \u00a7 26-2101); <em>Miller, </em>413 U.S. at 16 n. 1, 93 S.Ct. at 2611 n. 1 (Cal.Penal Code \u00a7 311.2(a)). That does not mean the Court has abandoned Milleds adoption of the <em>Roth </em>definition. The Supreme Court has never held that the Model Penal Code provides the only acceptable definition. States may choose other ways to define appeals to the prurient interest. <em>Cf. Smith v. United States, </em>431 U.S. 291, 310, 97 S.Ct. 1756, 1769, 52 L.Ed.2d 324 (1977) (Powell, J., concurring) (states have power to design their obscenity statutes as they see fit; \u201cWithin the boundaries staked out by <em>Miller, </em>the states retain broad latitude .... \u201d). Indeed, that is what has occurred.</p>\n<p id=\"b611-16\">In accepting this latitude to define, some states have not followed the Model Penal Code but have, as identified in <em>Miller </em>itself, 413 U.S. at 24 &amp; n. 6, 93 S.Ct. at 2615 &amp; n. 6, listed particular depictions of physical conduct. <em>See, e.g, id. </em>(1971 Ore.Laws, c. 743, art. 29, \u00a7\u00a7 255-262; 1972 Hawaii Sess. Laws, Act 9, c. 12, pt. II, at 126-29); <em>see also Young v. American Mini Theatres, </em>427 U.S. 50, 53 &amp; n. 4, 96 S.Ct. 2440, 2444 &amp; n. 4, 49 L.Ed.2d 310 (1976) (Detroit zoning ordinance). Other states have chosen, by using <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"500\">*500</page-number>language like that in the <em>Roth </em>footnote, a third way to define appeal to the prurient interest. The Ohio legislature devised the following alternative definitions:</p>\n<blockquote id=\"b612-4\">\u201c(A) Any material or performance is \u2018obscene\u2019 if, when considered as a whole and judged with reference to ordinary adults, any of the following apply:</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b612-5\">\u201c(1) Its dominant appeal is to <em>prurient interest;</em></blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b612-6\">\u201c(2) Its dominant tendency is to arouse <em>lust </em>by displaying or depicting nudity, sexual excitement, or sexual conduct in a way which tends to represent human beings as mere objects of sexual appetite;</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b612-7\">\u201c(3) Its dominant tendency is to arouse <em>lust </em>by displaying or depicting bestiality or extreme or bizarre violence, cruelty, or brutality;</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b612-8\">\u201c(4) It contains a series of displays or descriptions of nudity, sexual excitement, sexual conduct, bestiality, extreme or bizarre violence, cruelty, or brutality, or human bodily functions of elimination, the cumulative effect of which is a dominant tendency to appeal to <em>prurient interest, </em>when the appeal to such interest is primarily for its own sake or for commercial exploitation, rather than for a genuine scientific, educational, sociological, moral, or artistic purpose.\u201d Ohio Rev. Code Ann. \u00a7 2905.34 (Supp.1972), now Ohio Rev.Code Ann. \u00a7 2907.01 (1975).</blockquote>\n<p id=\"b612-9\"><em>See Art Theatre Guild, Inc. v. Ewing, </em>421 U.S. 923, 923-24, 95 S.Ct. 1649, 1649, 44 L.Ed.2d 82 (1975) (Brennan, J., dissenting from dismissal for want of a substantial federal question) (emphasis added). The state courts enjoined the showing of a film under this statute. The Supreme Court dismissed an appeal from the injunction. <em>Id. </em>at 923, 95 S.Ct. at 1649. Although the Court clearly had the \u201cultimate power .. . to conduct an independent review of [any] constitutional claims,\u201d <em>Miller, </em>413 U.S. at 25, 93 S.Ct. at 2615, it saw no substantial federal question raised despite the use of the word \u201clust.\u201d <em>See also State ex rel. Keating v. \u201cVixen\u201d, </em>35 Ohio St.2d 215, 301 N.E.2d 880 (1973) (without construing the Ohio statutes in any way, holding they comport with <em>Miller).</em></p>\n<p id=\"b612-11\">Nebraska\u2019s definition of obscenity, Neb. Rev.Stat. \u00a7 28-926.07 (1964), incorporates language from <em>Roth </em>and the Model Penal Code as alternatives. The statute asks whether the dominant theme of material \u201cappeals to the prurient interest, which is to excite <em>lustful thoughts, </em>or a shameful or morbid interest in nudity, sex, or excretion which goes substantially beyond the customary limits of candor.\u201d <em>Id. </em>(emphasis added). Ordered to reconsider a conviction under section 28-926.07 in light of <em>Miller, </em>the Nebraska Supreme Court found \u201cthe Nebraska statutes fully comply with the requirements of <em>Miller v. California </em>.... We have not given them a new or different construction [to reach that conclusion] . . .. \u201d <em>State </em>v. <em>Little Art Corp., </em>191 Neb. 448, 215 N.W.2d 853, 856, <em>on remand from </em>414 U.S. 1151, 94 S.Ct. 907, 39 L.Ed.2d 105 (1974). <em>See </em>Note, <em>Community Standards, Class Actions, and Obscenity Under </em>Miller v. California, 88 Harv.L.Rev. 1838, 1847 n. 51 (1975). Notably, the court considered \u201clust\u201d and \u201clasciviousness\u201d equivalent: \u201cThe word prurient in its application to obscenity means \u2018tending to excite lasciviousness\u2019 and lasciviousness means the presence or arousal of sexual desire. Similarly applied to obscenity the word lustful refers to sexual desire.\u201d <em>Id.</em></p>\n<p id=\"b612-12\">In Georgia, although the statute tracks the Model Penal Code definition of obscenity, the courts have recently defined material appealing to the prurient interest as \u201cmaterial which has a tendency to excite <em>lustful </em>thoughts.\u201d <em>Spry </em>v. <em>State, </em>156 Ga. App. 74, 274 S.E.2d 2, 5 (Ga.App.1980) (emphasis added). A jury instruction along those lines \u201csimply gave the jury a better understanding of the meaning of prurient appeal. See <em>Roth v. United States, </em>354 U.S. 476, 477(4), 487 [77 S.Ct. 1304, 1310, 1 L.Ed.2d 1498] .. .. \u201d <em>Spry </em>v. <em>State, </em>274 S.E.2d at 5.</p>\n<p id=\"b612-13\">It would appear, therefore, that neither the Supreme Court nor state courts have abandoned the use of the term \u201clust\u201d in proscribing obscenity under the first <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"501\">*501</page-number>amendment. The Model Penal Code definition, although helpful, has not been decreed the only acceptable method of defining prurient interest.</p>\n<p id=\"b613-5\">The majority\u2019s other argument is that the meanings of words change, and \u201clust\u201d no longer aids anyone in defining prurient interest. The scope of obscenity may indeed differ from place to place, time to time, and culture to culture. <em>See, e.g., </em>Richards, <em>Free Speech and Obscenity Law: Toward a Moral Theory of the First Amendment, </em>128 U.Pa.L.Rev. 45, 53 &amp; n. 52 (1974), <em>citing </em>G. Gorer, <em>The Danger of Equality </em>218 (1966), and La Barre, <em>Obscenity, An Anthropological Appraisal, </em>20 Law and Contemp.Prob. 533, 541-42 (1955), (certain southsea island cultures find eating in public obscene). In our obscenity jurisprudence, this concern for changing definitions is met head-on by the criterion of \u201ccontemporary community standards,\u201d <em>Miller, </em>413 U.S. at 24, 93 S.Ct. at 2615; <em>Roth, </em>354 U.S. at 489-90, 77 S.Ct. at 1311-12. <em>See McKinney </em>v. <em>Alabama, </em>424 U.S. 669, 689-90, 96 S.Ct. 1189, 1200, 47 L.Ed.2d 1189 (1976) (Brennan, J., concurring in the result) (\u201ccommunity standards are inherently in a state of flux .... \u201d). <em>Cf. Broadrick v. Oklahoma, </em>413 U.S. 601, 608, 93 S.Ct. 2908, 2913, 37 L.Ed.2d 830 (1973) (\u201cWords inevitably contain germs of uncertainty .... \u201d). The majority, however, finds the Supreme Court\u2019s explicit provision for ascertaining change inadequate. Discarding the term \u201clust\u201d on purely \u201clegal\u201d grounds of changed societal definition usurps the purpose of the \u201ccontemporary community standards\u201d test.</p>\n<p id=\"b613-6\">The majority also forgets that any purely legal definitions in this area are less dependent on particular editions of dictionaries, or on an interview in <em>Playboy </em>magazine,<footnotemark>1</footnotemark> than on the Supreme Court. <em>See, e.g., Miller, </em>413 U.S. at 18 n. 2, 93 S.Ct. at 2612 n. 2 (words \u201cobscene material\u201d have a specific judicial meaning derived from <em>Roth). </em>The Supreme Court has not adopted the definitional change as embraced by the majority. The Court has used \u201clust\u201d to help define \u201cprurient interest.\u201d <em>Roth, </em>354 U.S. at 487 n. 20, 77 S.Ct. at 1310 n. 20. The Court has reconfirmed the vitality of this use by citation to <em>Roth. See Miller, </em>413 U.S. at 18 n. 2, 93 S.Ct. at 2612 n. 2. <em>Cf. Erznoznik v. City of Jacksonville, </em>422 U.S. 205, 213 n. 10, 95 S.Ct. 2268, 2275 n. 10, 45 L.Ed.2d 125 (1975) (\u201c[T]o be obscene, \u2018such expression must be, in some significant way, erotic.\u2019 \u201d), <em>citing Cohen v. California, </em>403 U.S. 15, 20, 91 S.Ct. 1780, 1785, 29 L.Ed.2d 284 (1971), which, in turn, cites solely <em>Roth. </em>The Supreme Court has not subsequently forbidden the use of \u201clust\u201d to help define \u201cprurient interest.\u201d <em>See Art Theatre Guild, Inc. </em>v. <em>Ewing, </em>421 U.S. 923, 95 S.Ct. 1649, 44 L.Ed.2d 82. State courts have upheld the use of \u201clust\u201d since <em>Miller </em>to help define prurient interest. <em>E.g., State v. Little Art Corp., </em>191 Neb. 448, 215 N.W.2d 853. Therefore, I conclude that the majority is wrong in holding as a matter of law that alleged, but unproven, changes in society\u2019s definition of \u201clust\u201d authorize this court to erase the word from a constitutionally permissible definition. If there has been a change in the community view, it will be expressed in the first prong of the <em>Miller </em>test in assessing contemporary community standards.</p>\n<p id=\"b613-9\">Dealing with an obscenity definition is not easy work. Often reasonable minds will differ. Indeed, had I been the drafter of the Washington statute, I would have used a different definition. But the question before us is whether, as a matter of law, use of the word \u201clust\u201d as part of the definition of prurient interest violates the <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"502\">*502</page-number>first amendment. I conclude that the majority was wrong in reading \u201clust\u201d out of the <em>Roth </em>definition as affirmed by <em>Miller </em>and that the majority was wrong in holding, as a matter of law, that the meaning of \u201clust\u201d has changed so that it may not be a part of the <em>Roth-Miller </em>definition of prurient interest.</p>\n<p id=\"b614-4\">At worst, Washington\u2019s use of \u201clust\u201d taken from <em>Roth </em>stands subject to construction in light of <em>Miller, </em>which cited that part of <em>Roth </em>sixteen years later. A \u201climiting\u201d construction is so obvious that, for prudential reasons, we should at least refuse to decide the plaintiffs\u2019 constitutional challenges on the basis of Washington\u2019s mere use of the word \u201clust\u201d until a case arises applying the statute. <em>See, e.g., Broadrick v. Oklahoma, </em>413 U.S. at 613, 93 S.Ct. at 2916; <em>see also </em>Monaghan, <em>Overbreadth, </em>1981 S.Ct.Rev. 1, 35 (in a declaratory judgment action, the litigant in substance asks \u201cwhether the courts will, as a matter of statutory construction, refuse to narrow the statute to constitutional boundaries .... \u201d). <em>Cf. Dombrowski v. Pfister, </em>380 U.S. 479, 491-92, 85 S.Ct. 1116, 1123-24, 14 L.Ed.2d 22 (1965) (no readily apparent construction could repair the vagueness of the state law in question, so, in the face of threatened prosecutions, plaintiffs received \u201cappropriate equitable relief without awaiting declaratory judgments in the state courts\u201d).</p>\n<p id=\"b614-5\">As another court recently observed, \u201c[w]e must not make it impossible to draft legislation by finding facial overbreadth and ambiguity in all words.\u201d <em>Red Bluff Drive-In, Inc. v. Vance, </em>648 F.2d 1020, 1034 (5th Cir.1981), <em>cert. denied, </em>455 U.S. 913, 102 S.Ct. 1264, 71 L.Ed.2d 453 (1982). The majority, by finding facial overbreadth in the word \u201clust,\u201d forbids Washington to draft legislation based on Supreme Court precedent. The majority, I conclude, is wrong.</p>\n<footnote label=\"20\">\n<p id=\"b610-12\"> <em>i.e., material having a tendency to excite lustful thoughts. </em>Webster\u2019s New International</p>\n<p id=\"AIC\"><page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"499\">*499</page-number>Dictionary (Unabridged, 2d ed., 1949) defines <em>prurient, </em>in pertinent part, as follows:</p>\n<blockquote id=\"b611-5\">\u201c...
