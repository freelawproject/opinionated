On Thursday morning, May 28, 1981, at about 11:30 a.m., a number of off-duty employees accompanied by a union organizer entered restaurant 768 and took over the restaurant. Some of the employees on duty, including Cynthia Diane Williams, joined the takeover. As \u00e1 result of the said activity, Burger King suspended certain employees involved in the takeover. However, during the melee ensuing as a result of the takeover of the restaurant, Gregg Barnhardt, who had arrived some IV2 hours after the takeover, asked Cynthia Williams, \u201cWhat happened that made everyone so angry?\u201d She proceeded to answer. Barnhardt then asked what a union could do for the employees. Thereupon the conversation was terminated. Williams testified that she did not feel intimidated by the conversation.</p>\n<p id=\"b1166-16\">On May 28, 1981, Barnhardt noticed that Williams was wearing an unauthorized \u201cULU\u201d button. He asked her if she knew that wearing the button was against company policy. She removed the button. Griggs, a drive-in window employee of Burger King who greeted customers, on hearing the conversation between Barn-hardt and Williams removed her ULU pin.</p>\n<p id=\"b1166-17\">Charges were filed with the National Labor Relations Board. We are concerned with only two of those charges: One, that the conversation between Barnhardt and Williams was coercive in nature, and two, that the enforcement of the rule by Burger <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"1055\">*1055</page-number>King against the unauthorized wearing of buttons and other adornment by employees was improper.</p>\n<p id=\"b1167-5\">The administrative law judge held that the conversation between Barnhardt and Williams was coercive and violated Section 8(a)(1) of the Act. He dismissed the charge regarding button wearing involving employee Griggs. The NLRB sustained the finding that the conversation between Barnhardt and Williams was coercive and reversed his ruling that the company was permitted to require the removal of the labor union buttons.</p>\n<p id=\"b1167-6\">An examination of the record in the case reveals that the environment at the restaurant on May 28, 1981, was confused. The inquiry to determine what had been the catalyst for the events made by a supervising employee IV2 hours after the labor confrontation is innocuous at best. His question to the effect \u201cWhat can a union do for you?\u201d is far from coercive. This court has long held that inquiries alone do not amount to coercion. The test is set forth in <em>N.L.R.B. v. Elias Bros. Big Boy, Inc., </em>325 F.2d 360 (6th Cir.1963) and reaffirmed in <em>National Labor Relations Board </em>v. <em>Streamway Division of the Scott &amp; Fetzer Company, </em>691 F.2d 288 (6th Cir.1982); <em>see also Charge Card Association v. National Labor Relations Board, </em>653 F.2d 272 (6th Cir.1981). The determination by the NLRB regarding coercive interrogation will not be enforced.</p>\n<p id=\"b1167-7\">As to the labor union button worn by Griggs, the employee who had contact with the public, we find that all of the Burger King food-handling employees are provided with identical uniforms which they are required to wear on the job in a neat and well-pressed condition. The policy includes a published regulation that \u201conly company approved name tags, buttons and alterations in uniforms are allowed.\u201d The administrative law judge found:</p>\n<blockquote id=\"b1167-8\">I place little reliance on the general counsel\u2019s alternative argument that the respondent disparately applied its general regulation permitting employees to wear nonunion related buttons and insignia on their uniforms but restricting them in the wearing of union buttons. Two witnesses testified that they have either seen or personally worn buttons to work wearing [sic, bearing] such descriptions as \u201cKiss Me, I\u2019m Polish\u201d or containing fuzzy, smiley faces. These rare and incidental departures from the norm do not establish a company practice, either locally or nationally, of permitting deviations from its published rule. Mrs. Amato testified credibly that she repeatedly warned employees that the wearing of buttons and insignia, even including religious insignia, violated company policy and regularly required employees to remove such insignia while at work.</blockquote>\n<p id=\"b1167-10\">Note 5, App. p. 20. The record supports his finding.</p>\n<p id=\"b1167-11\">Here Burger King has attempted to project a clean, professional image to the public. It has consistently enforced its policy against wearing unauthorized buttons in a nondiscriminatory manner. It is a national fast food chain deriving much of its recognition from its uniform public image. It is not asserted that this policy had its inception because of labor unions or union activities. There are special circumstances which justify this prohibition. <em>See National Labor Relations Board v. Harrah\u2019s Club, </em>337 F.2d 177 (9th Cir.1964); <em>see also, Larand Leisurelies, Inc. v. National Labor Relations Board, </em>523 F.2d 814 (6th Cir.1975); <em>Davi-son-Paxon Company, a Division of R.H. Macy &amp; Company v. National Labor Relations Board, </em>462 F.2d 364 (5th Cir.1972). The NLRB order regarding union buttons will not be enforced insofar as it applies to employees who have contact with the public. We think the rule in this circuit should be that where an employer enforces a policy that its employees may only wear authorized uniforms in a consistent and nondiscriminatory fashion and where those employees have contact with the public, a \u201cspecial circumstance\u201d exists as a matter of law which justifies the banning of union buttons.</p>\n</opinion>\n<opinion data-order=\"10\" data-type=\"opinion\" id=\"x999-3\" type=\"concurring-in-part-and-dissenting-in-part\">\n<author id=\"b1167-12\">ENGEL, Circuit Judge,</author>\n<p id=\"AL72\">concurring in part and dissenting in part.</p>\n<p id=\"b1167-13\">Although I fully agree that the Board was incorrect in finding the ban on <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"1056\">*1056</page-number>buttons to have been a violation of the Act, I disagree with the majority\u2019s treatment of the coercive questioning issue. While I believe that Barnhardt\u2019s questions to Cynthia Williams about the union were, in the abstract, not coercive, the circumstances in which the conversation occurred provide substantial support for the Board\u2019s findings of coercive effect. Those circumstances were: (a) Barnhardt was obviously part of the company management and had come to the particular outlet in response to the local manager\u2019s call for help, and (b) his questioning came at a time when the restaurant was shut down because of the incident and emotions were still running high. Thus, the conditions surrounding the interrogation were very different from the circumstances in <em>National Labor Relations Board v. Streamway Division of the Scott and Fetzer Co., </em>691 F.2d 288 (6th Cir.1982), cited by the majority. In <em>Streamway, </em>we found that the questioning concerning a union was not coercive because it was conducted \u201cnot by the Company but by a professional attitude survey company\u201d and because the questions were asked in a relaxed atmosphere. Given the very different conditions in this case, I am unwilling to disturb the Board\u2019s finding that such inquiries would tend to have a coercive effect upon the employees so questioned.</p>\n</opinion>\n<opinion data-order=\"11\" data-type=\"opinion\" id=\"x999-4\" type=\"concurring-in-part-and-dissenting-in-part\">\n<author id=\"b1168-4\">MERRITT, Circuit Judge,</author>\n<p id=\"AfW\">concurring in part and dissenting in part.</p>\n<p id=\"b1168-5\">Although I agree with Judge Morton that the Board\u2019s determination regarding coercive interrogation should not be enforced, I do not agree with Judge Morton\u2019s and Judge Engel\u2019s decision that the Board\u2019s order regarding union buttons should not be enforced because this case presents a set of facts which constitute \u201cspecial circumstances\u201d as a matter of law justifying Burger King\u2019s banning of union buttons. In my opinion, there is ample case law as well as substantial evidence supporting the Board\u2019s finding that Burger King violated section 8(a)(1) of the Act by prohibiting a restaurant employee from wearing a union button.</p>\n<p id=\"b1168-6\">An employee has a right, protected by section 7 of the Act, 29 U.S.C. \u00a7 157, to wear union buttons and insignia at work, unless the employer demonstrates the existence of \u201cspecial circumstances\u201d which necessitate the banning of such insignia in order to reduce employee dissension or distractions from work, maintain employee safety and discipline, protect machinery or products, or project a certain image to the public. <em>Pay \u2019N Save v. N.L.R.B., </em>641 F.2d 697, 700 (9th Cir.1981). Only the last of these special factors is even arguably present in the instant case; indeed, the Board found and the record supports that the union button involved here is small, innocuous, and unprovocative. There is no evidence in the record indicating even the possibility that customers might complain about such buttons or that these buttons damaged the employees\u2019 image more than the few buttons sanctioned by the employer. Furthermore, Burger King\u2019s ban applies to all of its employees, including those who do not have any public contact; as such, Burger King\u2019s justification for the ban is insufficient <em>See N.L.R.B. v. Montgomery Ward &amp; Co., Inc., </em>554 F.2d 996, 1000 (10th Cir.1977).</p>\n<p id=\"b1168-7\">I simply cannot distinguish this case on any meaningful ground from those cases in which courts have found \u201cspecial circumstances\u201d did not exist to justify banning employees from wearing union buttons while they are working and having public contact at a convenience store; <em>see Pay \u2019N Save v. N.L.R.B., </em>or a department store, <em>see NLRB v. Montgomery Ward. </em>Moreover, the Board\u2019s order regarding union buttons at Burger King is consistent with its earlier order in <em>Glenlynn, Inc., d/b/a McDonald\u2019s Drive-In Restaurant, </em>204 NLRB 299, 310 (1973), prohibiting a restaurant virtually identical to Burger King from banning its employees\u2019 wearing of union buttons.</p>\n</opinion>\n</casebody>\n",
