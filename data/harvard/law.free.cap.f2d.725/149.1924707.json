Appellant argues that the assistance of counsel that he received at the trial was ineffective. Judging counsel\u2019s performance by the \u201creasonably competent assistance\u201d standard, which we adopt in this opinion, we affirm the judgment of the district court.</p>\n<p id=\"b262-15\">I.</p>\n<p id=\"b262-16\">Appellant Trapnell was found guilty in May 1973 after a jury trial before then Chief Judge Mishler on all three counts of an indictment charging him with aircraft piracy, 49 U.S.C. \u00a7 1472(i), interference with an aircraft flight crew, 49 U.S.C. \u00a7 1472(j), and possession of a firearm in the commission of a federal crime, 18 U.S.C. \u00a7 924(c)(2). All three charges stemmed from Trapnell\u2019s hijacking of a TWA airliner on a scheduled flight between Los Angeles and New York, in January 1972. The basic facts relating to the hijacking are set forth in this court\u2019s opinion affirming Trapnell\u2019s conviction. See <em>United States v. Trapnell, </em>495 F.2d 22 (2d Cir.), cert. denied, 419 U.S. 851, 95 S.Ct. 93, 42 L.Ed.2d 82 (1974). We presume general familiarity with that opinion. We note, however, that Trapnell was tried twice: his first trial, before Judge Rosling, resulted in a mistrial because the jury was unable to reach a verdict; his second trial, before Judge Mishler, resulted in his conviction. In both trials, Trapnell presented an insanity defense.</p>\n<p id=\"b262-17\">In this collateral attack on his conviction, Trapnell points out that three witnesses who were not called to testify at the second trial \u2014 Drs. Stanley Portnow, James Cravens and David Hubbard \u2014 had had the most sustained contact with Trapnell immediately after the hijacking and were therefore in the best position to testify about his insanity at the time of the crime. Trapnell argues that the psychiatrists who testified at the second trial did not agree on the question of his insanity, and that if Drs. Port-now, Cravens and Hubbard had testified, the jury would have been likely to find that the government had not proven his sanity beyond a reasonable doubt. In addition, Trapnell argues that his attorney at the second trial relied too heavily on subpoenas to compel testimony, and did not adequately establish the professional qualifications of the expert witnesses. According to appellant, at his second trial he was not accorded <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"151\">*151</page-number>his Sixth Amendment right to \u201ceffective assistance of counsel.\u201d Appellant also urges us to reject the \u201cfarce and mockery\u201d standard used by this court to determine whether the assistance of counsel at a criminal trial was \u201ceffective,\u201d and to adopt instead a standard of \u201creasonable competence.\u201d That issue, as well as the merits of the appeal, was briefed and argued by both parties.</p>\n<p id=\"b263-5\">II.</p>\n<p id=\"b263-6\">Before examining appellant\u2019s specific contentions, we discuss the appropriate standard of competence for a defendant\u2019s attorney in a criminal trial. In the Second Circuit, that standard has been governed for over thirty years by the rule laid down in <em>United States v. Wight, </em>176 F.2d 376, 379 (2d Cir.1949), cert. denied, 338 U.S. 950, 70 S.Ct. 478, 94 L.Ed. 586 (1950): \u201cA lack of effective assistance of counsel must be of such a kind as to shock the conscience of the court and make the proceedings a farce and mockery of justice.\u201d In <em>Wight, </em>this court adopted the standard first formulated by Judge Thurman Arnold for the D.C. Circuit in <em>Diggs v. Welch, </em>148 F.2d 667, 670 (D.C. Cir.), cert. denied, 325 U.S. 889, 65 S.Ct. 1576, 89 L.Ed. 2002 (1945). By 1962, nine of the eleven circuits were applying the <em>Diggs </em>\u201cfarce and mockery\u201d standard. See <em>In re Ernst, </em>294 F.2d 556, 558 (3d Cir.), cert. denied, 368 U.S. 917, 82 S.Ct. 198, 7 L.Ed.2d 132 (1961); <em>Snead v. Smyth, </em>273 F.2d 838, 842 (4th Cir.1959); <em>O\u2019Malley v. United States, </em>285 F.2d 733, 734 (6th Cir.1961); <em>United States ex rel. Feeley v. Ragen, </em>166 F.2d 976, 980-81 (7th Cir.1948); <em>Johnston v. United States, </em>254 F.2d 239, 240 (8th Cir. 1958); <em>Cofield v. United States, </em>263 F.2d 686, 689 (9th Cir.), rev\u2019d per curiam on other grounds, 360 U.S. 472, 79 S.Ct. 1430, 3 L.Ed.2d 1531 (1959); <em>Frand v. United States, </em>301 F.2d 102, 103 (10th Cir.1962). The two remaining circuits adopted the \u201cfarce and mockery\u201d standard in 1965 and 1970, respectively. See <em>Williams v. Beto, </em>354 F.2d 698, 704 (5th Cir.1965); <em>Bottiglio v. United States, </em>431 F.2d 930, 931 (1st Cir. 1970) (per curiam).</p>\n<p id=\"b263-7\">The resulting uniformity in the standard of competence of counsel was disrupted in 1970, when the Fifth Circuit stated: \u201cWe interpret the right to counsel as the right to effective counsel. We interpret counsel to mean not errorless counsel, and not counsel judged ineffective by hindsight, but counsel reasonably likely to render <em>and rendering </em>reasonably effective assistance.\u201d <em>Caraway v. Beto, </em>421 F.2d 636, 637 (5th Cir.1970) (per curiam) (quoting <em>MacKenna v. Ellis, </em>280 F.2d 592, 599 (5th Cir.1960), modified, 289 F.2d 928 (5th Cir.), <em>cert. denied, </em>368 U.S. 877, 82 S.Ct. 121, 7 L.Ed.2d 78 (1961)). That same year, the Third Circuit replaced the \u201cfarce and mockery\u201d standard with a standard of \u201cnormal competency.\u201d <em>Moore v. United States, </em>432 F.2d 730, 737 (3d Cir. 1970) (in banc). Similarly, the D.C. Circuit, apparently the original architect of the \u201cfarce and mockery\u201d test, held in 1973 that \u201ca defendant is entitled to the reasonably competent assistance of an attorney acting as his diligent and conscientious advocate.\u201d <em>United States v. DeCoster, </em>487 F.2d 1197, 1202 (D.C.Cir.1973); see also id. at 1203 (\u201cCounsel should be guided by the American Bar Association Standards for the Defense Function.\u201d). Since 1970, every circuit except this one has adopted a \u201creasonably competent assistance\u201d standard, in one of its many formulations. See <em>United States v. Bosch, </em>584 F.2d 1113, 1120-21 (1st Cir. 1978) (\u201creasonably competent assistance\u201d); <em>Marzullo v. Maryland, </em>561 F.2d 540, 543-44 (4th Cir.1977), cert. denied, 435 U.S. 1011, 98 S.Ct. 1885, 56 L.Ed.2d 394 (1978) (\u201cnormal competency\u201d); <em>Beasley </em>v. <em>United States, </em>491 F.2d 687, 696 (6th Cir.1974) (\u201creasonably effective assistance\u201d); <em>United States ex rel. Williams </em>v. <em>Twomey, </em>510 F.2d 634, 641 (7th Cir.), cert, denied, 423 U.S. 876, 96 S.Ct. 148, 46 L.Ed.2d 109 (1975) (\u201cminimum standard of professional representation\u201d); <em>United States v. Easter, </em>539 F.2d 663, 666 (8th Cir.1976) (\u201ccustomary skills and diligence\u201d of \u201ca reasonably competent attorney\u201d); <em>Cooper v. Fitzharris, </em>586 F.2d 1325, 1328 (9th Cir.1978) (in banc), cert. denied, 440 U.S. 974, 99 S.Ct. 1542, 59 L.Ed.2d 793 (1979) (\u201creasonably competent and effective\u201d assistance); <em>Dyer v. Crisp, </em>613 F.2d <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"152\">*152</page-number>275, 278 (10th Cir.) (in banc), cert. denied, 445 U.S. 945, 100 S.Ct. 1342, 63 L.Ed.2d 779 (1980) (\u201creasonably competent assistance\u201d). The Eleventh Circuit, which adopted Fifth Circuit law as precedent in <em>Bonner v. City of Prichard, </em>661 F.2d 1206, 1207 (11th Cir. 1981) (in banc), recently reaffirmed the Fifth Circuit\u2019s \u201creasonably effective assistance\u201d standard in <em>Douglas v. Wainwright, </em>714 F.2d 1532, 1553 (11th Cir.1983).</p>\n<p id=\"b264-4\">Similarly, only a few state courts now apply the \u201cfarce and mockery\u201d standard. See Note, A Functional Analysis of the Effective Assistance of Counsel, 80 Colum. L.Rev. 1053, 1058 n. 41 (1980). In particular, all three states within this circuit have adopted the new standard for assessing the competence of counsel in criminal trials. In <em>People v. Droz, </em>39 N.Y.2d 457, 463, 384 N.Y.S.2d 404, 348 N.E.2d 880 (1976), the New York Court of Appeals vacated a conviction, stating that \u201cwe cannot say that the representation defendant received was adequate or effective in any meaningful sense of the word.\u201d This case was later interpreted as abandoning the \u201cfarce and mockery\u201d standard that had prevailed in the state. See <em>People v. Aiken, </em>45 N.Y.2d 394, 398, 408 N.Y.S.2d 444, 380 N.E.2d 272 (1978). New York now appears to follow a \u201creasonable competence\u201d standard. See <em>Barnes v. Jones, </em>665 F.2d 427, 434 (2d Cir. 1981), rev\u2019d on other grounds, \u2014 U.S. \u2014, 103 S.Ct. 3308, 77 L.Ed.2d 987 (1983). Vermont adopted a \u201ccustomary skill and knowledge\u201d standard in 1975. See <em>In re Cronin, </em>133 Vt. 234, 240, 336 A.2d 164 (1975). Connecticut embraced a \u201creasonable competence\u201d standard in 1976. See <em>State v. Clark, </em>170 Conn. 273, 365 A.2d 1167, 1172 (Conn.), cert. denied, 425 U.S. 962, 96 S.Ct. 1748, 48 L.Ed.2d 208 (1976).</p>\n<p id=\"b264-10\">The Second Circuit is now the only circuit court that has wrestled with this problem and not embraced the \u201creasonably competent assistance\u201d standard for trials in criminal cases. Members of this court, however, have repeatedly expressed their displeasure or concern over continuing reliance on the <em>Wight </em>rule. For example, Judge Oakes recently urged that \u201cthe Second Circuit at long last join the rest of the federal judiciary, as well as the leading state courts of last resort, in abandoning the contentless, outmoded farce and mockery rule.\u201d <em>Langone v. Smith, </em>682 F.2d 287, 289 (2d Cir. 1982) (Oakes, J., dissenting from denial of rehearing in banc), cert. denied, \u2014 U.S. \u2014, 103 S.Ct. 739, 74 L.Ed.2d 961 (1983); see also <em>Rickenbacker v. Warden, </em>550 F.2d 62, 67-68 (2d Cir.1976) (Oakes, J., dissenting), cert. denied, 434 U.S. 826, 98 S.Ct. 103, 54 L.Ed.2d 85 (1977). Similarly, Judge Mansfield has called for a re-evaluation of the \u201cfarce and mockery\u201d standard. <em>Indiviglio v. United States, </em>612 F.2d 624, 632 (2d Cir.1979) (Mansfield, J., concurring), cert. denied, 445 U.S. 933, 100 S.Ct. 1326, 63 L.Ed.2d 768 (1980); <em>Bellavia v. Fogg, </em>613 F.2d 369, 375-76 n. 1 (2d Cir.1979) (Mansfield, J., concurring and dissenting). And, referring to this standard, Judge Kaufman warned against \u201cfall[ing] prey to the pitfalls of rigid adherence to phrases and formulas which seem to gain strength by ritualistic repetition in <em>haec verba </em>in case after case.\u201d <em>United States ex rel. Marcelin v. Mancusi, </em>462 F.2d 36, 46 (2d Cir.1972) (Kaufman, J., dissenting), cert. denied, 410 U.S. 917, 93 S.Ct. 977,35 L.Ed.2d 279 (1973).</p>\n<p id=\"b264-15\">In addition, members of the Supreme Court have expressed their displeasure with the resulting conflict among the circuits. In 1978, when a few circuits still subscribed to the \u201cfarce and mockery\u201d standard, Justice White argued that the Court \u201cshould attempt to eliminate disparities in the minimum quality of representation required to be provided to indigent defendants.\u201d <em>Maryland v. Marzullo, </em>435 U.S. 1011, 1012-13, 98 S.Ct. 1885, 1886-87, 56 L.Ed.2d 394 (1978) (White, J., joined by Rehnquist, J., dissenting from denial of certiorari). Last year, Justice White stated that while it was possible that a trial attorney\u2019s failure to offer exculpatory testimony given at a suppression hearing and his failure to call favorable witnesses may have \u201csatisfied the more exacting standard the [Second Circuit] has rejected ... there was no holding to that effect, and that question should be answered by the [Second Circuit] after the level of minimum competence required by <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"153\">*153</page-number>the Sixth Amendment is determined by this Court.\u201d <em>Romero v. United States, </em>459 U.S. 926, 103 S.Ct. 236, 237, 74 L.Ed.2d 187 (1982) (White, J., dissenting from denial of certiorari).</p>\n<p id=\"b265-6\">But although this court has not explicitly abandoned the \u201cfarce and mockery\u201d for the \u201creasonably competent assistance\u201d standard, it has justified its failure to reconsider the standard by pointing out that the result in the cases before it would have been the same under either formulation. See <em>United States </em>v. <em>Daniels, </em>558 F.2d 122, 126 (2d Cir.1977); <em>Rickenbacker v. Warden, </em>supra, 550 F.2d at 66; cf. <em>Indiviglio v. United States, </em>supra, 612 F.2d at 632 (Mansfield, J., concurring). For example, in <em>Rickenbaeker, </em>Judge Smith, the author of the <em>Wight </em>opinion, stated that \u201c[i]t may be that this court should reconsider the standard set forth in <em>Wight.\u201d </em>He added, however, that \u201cwe need not decide this issue now, for we conclude that the performance of Rickenbacker\u2019s counsel does not fail to meet any of the suggested standards, all of which involve the heavy burden of establishing incompetence.\u201d 550 F.2d at 66.</p>\n<p id=\"b265-7\">As we show below, in this case too the assistance that defendant received would be deemed \u201ceffective\u201d under either standard. But we think that the time has come to declare that \u201ceffective\u201d assistance means \u201creasonably competent assistance,\u201d which we regard as a shorthand for the standard that the quality of a defense counsel\u2019s representation should be within the range of competence reasonably expected of attorneys in criminal cases. See <em>United States v. Bosch, </em>supra, 584 F.2d at 1121; <em>Marzullo v. Maryland, </em>supra, 561 F.2d at 543-45. It would have been ideal, of course, to adopt the \u201creasonably competent assistance\u201d standard in a case in which the defense counsel\u2019s representation fell below that benchmark but nonetheless did not make the trial a \u201cfarce and mockery.\u201d Undoubtedly, such a case would best elucidate the different nuances of the two standards. But given the manner in which our court has applied the \u201cfarce and mockery\u201d standard in recent years, we are unsure that such a case will ever be before us.</p>\n<p id=\"b265-8\">First, we have repeatedly applied both standards in recent years and never found that the result of a case hinged on the choice of a particular standard. See <em>United States v. Taylor, </em>562 F.2d 1345, 1360 (2d Cir.), cert. denied, 432 U.S. 909, 97 S.Ct. 2958, 53 L.Ed.2d 1083 and 434 U.S. 853, 98 S.Ct. 170, 54 L.Ed.2d 124 (1977); <em>United States v. Medico, </em>557 F.2d 309, 318 &amp; n. 15 (2d Cir.), cert. denied, 434 U.S. 986, 98 S.Ct. 614, 54 L.Ed.2d 480 (1977); <em>United States v. Daniels, </em>supra, 558 F.2d at 126. Indeed, during the last three years, we have applied both standards in every ineffective assistance of counsel case decided by published opinion. And in every case, we found that the result would be the same under either standard. <em>United States v. Maniego, </em>710 F.2d 24, 26-27 (2d Cir.1983) (per curiam); <em>United States </em>v. <em>Helgesen, </em>669 F.2d 69, 71 (2d Cir.), cert. denied, 456 U.S. 929, 102 S.Ct. 1978, 72 L.Ed.2d 445 (1982); <em>United States v. Alessi, </em>638 F.2d 466, 477 (2d Cir. 1980); <em>United States v. Aulet, </em>618 F.2d 182, 187 (2d Cir.1980).</p>\n<p id=\"b265-9\">Second, we note that in applying the \u201cfarce and mockery\u201d standard, this court has in recent years often used language normally associated with the inquiry employed in the \u201creasonably competent assistance\u201d test. For example, in <em>Ennis v. LeFevre, </em>560 F.2d 1072, 1076 (2d Cir.1977), cert. denied, 435 U.S. 976, 98 S.Ct. 1625, 56 L.Ed.2d 70 (1978), Judge Meskill pointed out that if defendant\u2019s counsel failed to press an argument that had obvious merit, act as an advocate, obtain an adequate record or perform a conscientious investigation, the defendant could prevail on an ineffective assistance claim. This enumeration of different elements of a claim of ineffective assistance, together with the listing of objective criteria (e.g., failure to press an argument) is typical of \u201creasonably competent assistance\u201d standards. See <em>United States v. DeCoster, </em>supra, 487 F.2d at 1203-04. Similarly, in <em>Saltys v. Adams, </em>465 F.2d 1023, 1028 (2d Cir.1972), Judge Oakes, joined by Judge Smith, held that the assistance of counsel had been inadequate because the attorney had not explored, at a <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"154\">*154</page-number>suppression hearing in the absence of the jury, the evidence underlying the proposed in-court identification procedure. In support of this conclusion, Judge Oakes noted that this procedure had been described as \u201cproper\u201d by the Connecticut Supreme Court. The inquiry in that case does not appear to be very different from that required to determine whether the assistance was \u201creasonably competent,\u201d that is, whether the attorney took advantage of techniques deemed \u201cproper\u201d for criminal defenses.</p>\n<p id=\"b266-4\">Third, other circuits have found that as the \u201cfarce and mockery\u201d test evolved through the decades, it became little more than a shorthand description of an objective inquiry into \u201creasonable competence.\u201d For example, in moving from one standard to the other, the Ninth Circuit stated that \u201c[t]he reformulation more accurately describes the law as it has actually been applied, in this circuit and in others, for many years.\u201d <em>Cooper v. Fitzharris, </em>supra, 586 F.2d at 1330. Similarly, in adopting a new standard for the competency of counsel, the Eighth Circuit stated:</p>\n<blockquote id=\"b266-5\">As we perceive the standard established in our prior decisions it is that trial counsel fails to render effective assistance when he does not exercise the customary skills and diligence that a reasonably competent attorney would perform under similar circumstances. When he fails in the performance of this duty the proceedings may be said to have been reduced to a \u201cfarce\u201d and \u201cmockery of justice.\u201d</blockquote>\n<p id=\"APr\"><em>United States v. Easter, </em>supra, 539 F.2d at 666 (citations omitted).</p>\n<p id=\"b266-6\">Although the difference between the two standards, as they are now applied in this circuit, may be in large part a matter of semantics, there are nonetheless substantial reasons that call for the explicit adoption of a standard of \u201creasonable competence.\u201d First, such a new standard would be consistent with the Sixth Amendment jurisprudence developed by the Supreme Court in the wake of <em>Gideon v. Wainwright, </em>372 U.S. 335, 83 S.Ct. 792, 9 L.Ed.2d 799 (1963). The \u201cfarce and mockery\u201d standard, first formulated eighteen years before <em>Gideon, </em>was based on the due process clause of the Fifth Amendment. <em>Diggs v. Welch, </em>supra, 148 F.2d at 668-69, had viewed the Sixth Amendment somewhat narrowly to be concerned only with assuring the presence of counsel, leaving the performance of counsel to be tested against the more general \u201cfair trial\u201d standard of the Fifth Amendment\u2019s due process clause. More recently, however, the Sixth Amendment has become the source not only of the right to counsel but also of the standard to be used in determining whether the assistance of counsel is \u201ceffective.\u201d See <em>United States v. DeCoster, </em>supra, 487 F.2d at 1202. In particular, after the Supreme Court decided in <em>Gideon </em>that the Sixth Amendment right to counsel is of sufficiently fundamental importance to be binding on the states under the due process clause of the Fourteenth Amendment, the Court has repeatedly referred to some minimal quality of representation in articulating the level of assistance necessary to assure the constitutional validity of criminal convictions. For example, the Court has stated that a guilty plea can be challenged if counsel did not provide defendant with advice that was \u201cwithin the range of competence demanded of attorneys in criminal cases.\u201d <em>McMann v. Richardson, </em>397 U.S. 759, 770-71, 90 S.Ct. 1441, 1448-49, 25 L.Ed.2d 763 (1970). Similarly, in <em>Cuyler v. Sullivan, </em>446 U.S. 335, 344, 100 S.Ct. 1708, 1716, 64 L.Ed.2d 333 (1980), the Court said that \u201c[a] guilty plea is open to attack on the ground that counsel did not provide defendant with \u2018reasonably competent advice.\u2019 \u201d See also <em>Tollett v. Henderson, </em>411 U.S. 258, 267, 93 S.Ct. 1602, 1608, 36 L.Ed.2d 235 (1973) (defendant may attack plea by showing that counsel\u2019s advice did not meet the <em>McMann </em>standards). And recently, speaking about assistance at trial, Justice O\u2019Connor, writing for the Court, stated that \u201cthe Constitution guarantees criminal defendants ... a competent attorney.\u201d <em>Engle v. Isaac, </em>456 U.S. 107, 134, 102 S.Ct. 1558, 1574, 71 L.Ed.2d 783 (1982). Thus, although the Court has never directly addressed the question of whether \u201creasonably competent assistance\u201d at trial is constitutionally re<page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"155\">*155</page-number>quired, both the holding in <em>Tollett </em>and the dictum in <em>Isaac </em>clearly suggest that this standard is consistent with, and may in fact be required by, the Court\u2019s interpretation of the Sixth Amendment.</p>\n<p id=\"b267-5\">A second reason for adopting a \u201creasonably competent assistance\u201d formulation of the standard for competency of counsel in a criminal trial is that this standard complements current efforts to improve the quality of representation in federal courts. Regardless of the way the standards have been applied by us in recent years, \u201creasonably competent assistance\u201d has traditionally been perceived as a stricter constraint than \u201cfarce and mockery.\u201d Thus, the adoption of the former standard would underscore this court\u2019s concern with the quality of representation. In contrast, if we were to continue to reaffirm the \u201cfarce and mockery\u201d standard, our action could be perceived as undermining this circuit\u2019s salutory policy of attempting to raise the standards of advocacy in general and of criminal advocacy in particular. See Second Circuit Report\u2014 1979, at 20-21. Also, given the pilot program on Admission of Attorneys to Federal Practice, implemented by the Judicial Conference of the United States, which requires that attorneys meet certain special requirements before being deemed qualified to practice before the federal courts, see, e.g., Annual Report of the Director of the Administrative Office of the U.S. Courts\u2014 1979, at 103-05, it would be ironic if the Second Circuit reaffirmed a standard that appeared to be less demanding than that adopted by all of the state courts within its geographic jurisdiction.</p>\n<p id=\"b267-6\">For these reasons, we believe that the time has come for us explicitly to adopt the \u201creasonably competent assistance\u201d standard for criminal trials in this circuit. We do so now, and we note that this opinion has been circulated to all active members of the court, none of whom has requested a rehearing in banc.</p>\n<p id=\"b267-9\">III.</p>\n<p id=\"b267-10\">Applying the standard of reasonable competence, we find that the assistance Trapnell received was not inadequate.<footnotemark>1</footnotemark> We have repeatedly noted our reluctance to second-guess matters of trial strategy simply because the chosen strategy was not successful. See, e.g., <em>United States v. Helgesen, </em>supra, 669 F.2d at 72; <em>United States v. Aulet, </em>supra, 618 F.2d at 189. We find that all of the complaints against counsel concern matters of trial strategy and thus do not form the basis for a finding of ineffective assistance.</p>\n<p id=\"b267-11\">Appellant complains primarily that counsel at his second trial failed to call Drs. Portnow, Hubbard and Cravens, even though the latter two had testified for the defense in the first trial. But at the second trial, Trapnell\u2019s attorney did present three expert witnesses, who testified about Trap-nell\u2019s mental state: Drs. Augustus Kinzel, Jochanan Wiesenfreund and Gurstin Goldin. All three were psychiatrists and held teaching positions: Drs. Kinzel and Goldin at Columbia University, and Dr. Wiesenfreund at New York University. All three presented testimony that was favorable to Trapnell\u2019s insanity defense. Dr. Kinzel stated that Trapnell \u201cwas sufficiently impaired by mental illness not to be aware of what he was doing, the nature of what he was doing and certainly not to be able to control what he was doing.\u201d Dr. Wiesen-freund testified that Trapnell\u2019s conduct on the day of the hijacking was impaired by a mental disease or defect. Similarly, Dr. Goldin stated:</p>\n<blockquote id=\"b268-3\"><page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"156\">*156</page-number>My opinion is that at the time of the offense with which he has been charged his cognative [sic] and volitional capacities were impaired as a result of a psychological decompensatory process and that he was not able at the time, as a result of mental disease, to appreciate the wrongfulness of his behavior or to conform his behavior to the requires [sic] of the law.</blockquote>\n<p id=\"b268-4\">We find that even conceding appellant\u2019s contention that Drs. Portnow, Cravens and Hubbard had had the most sustained contact with Trapnell immediately after the hijacking, the decision not to call them to testify can easily be justified. Dr. Hubbard\u2019s testimony at the first trial was not favorable to Trapnell. He stated that Trapnell \u201cdid have substantial capacity to understand the wrongfulness of his act and to have avoided its performance.\u201d Dr. Cravens was not allowed to testify on the issue of Trapnell\u2019s sanity; Judge Rosling held that he was not qualified to do so. Moreover, the record indicates that the government had contemplated calling Dr. Portnow as a rebuttal witness at the first trial. Trapnell\u2019s attorney may in fact have pursued the most promising strategy available: presenting witnesses who had had less contact with Trapnell but who were willing to make a strong statement about his insanity. And while the insanity defense ultimately did not prevail, that by itself is insufficient reason to find that the assistance was ineffective.</p>\n<p id=\"b268-5\">We have considered all of appellant\u2019s other arguments in support of his contention that he was denied \u201ceffective\u201d assistance of counsel, and we find that they are without merit.<footnotemark>2</footnotemark> We thus affirm the judgment of the district court.</p>\n<footnote label=\"1\">\n<p id=\"b267-7\">. Trapnell\u2019s \u00a7 2255 petition and the govern-' ment\u2019s response to that petition are unaccountably missing from the record. Trapnell\u2019s present attorney has stated that he has been unable to locate these documents, despite repeated efforts. This court has made independent inquiries, but it has also failed to find the missing papers. We do have, however, Judge Mishler\u2019s memorandum decision and order dated January 18, 1982, which makes clear the nature of the issues before him, and we have examined the relevant portions of the transcripts of both trials. We also note that in its brief and at oral argument, the government did not argue that Trapnell was barred from raising these issues at this point. Thus, for the purposes of this appeal, we assume that the issues before us now were properly before Judge Mishler when he denied Trapnell\u2019s petition.</p>\n</footnote>\n<footnote label=\"2\">\n<p id=\"b268-7\">. Trapnell also argues that Judge Mishler was prejudiced at sentencing by an erroneous statement in the presentence investigation report. In denying the petition, Judge Mishler said that he did not rely on this statement. In this appeal, Trapnell does not explain the basis for his disagreement with Judge Mishler\u2019s conclusion, and deals with this argument only in one short footnote in his brief.</p>\n</footnote>\n</opinion>\n</casebody>\n",
