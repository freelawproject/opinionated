Soto, a detective in the Haver-straw, New York, police department. Because we agree with Soto\u2019s contention that he was entitled to qualified immunity in the circumstances of this case, we reverse.</p>\n<p id=\"b990-23\">O\u2019Hagan brought suit against Soto under 42 U.S.C. \u00a7 1983 (Supp. V 1981), alleging a denial of his Sixth Amendment right to counsel. The deprivation allegedly occurred when Soto, questioning O'Hagan at the police station following O\u2019Hagan\u2019s arrest for possession of stolen property, denied him the opportunity to make a telephone call. No incriminating statement was obtained. Subsequently O\u2019Hagan called his father, who came to the police station and secured his son\u2019s release on bail after an arraignment before a Village Justice. The criminal charge was ultimately dismissed.</p>\n<p id=\"b990-24\">Trial of the section 1983 claim resulted in an initial verdict of $25,000 compensatory damages and $25,000 punitive damages. Chief Judge Motley understandably ruled these awards excessive and, upon O\u2019Hagan\u2019s refusal to accept a remittitur down to $1,500, ordered a new trial limited to damages, 565 F.Supp. 422. Upon retrial before Judge Palmieri, the second jury awarded O\u2019Hagan no damages.<footnotemark>1</footnotemark> After subsequent <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"879\">*879</page-number>procedural steps not relevant to this appeal, Chief Judge Motley ordered that the action be discontinued upon plaintiffs agreement to accept $1 as nominal damages.<footnotemark>2</footnotemark> Soto did not agree to pay the dollar, apparently resisting any acknowledgement of wrongdoing.</p>\n<p id=\"b991-5\">Soto contends on appeal, among other things, that O\u2019Hagan\u2019s Sixth Amendment right to counsel had not attached during questioning at the police station and did not attach until the subsequent arraignment which, in his view, marked the commencement of criminal proceedings within the meaning of <em>Kirby v. Illinois, </em>406 U.S. 682, 689, 92 S.Ct. 1877, 1882, 32 L.Ed.2d 411 (1972). In <em>United States ex rel. Robinson v. Zelker, </em>468 F.2d 159 (2d Cir.1972), we held that New York criminal proceedings begin, for Sixth Amendment purposes, with the issuance of an arrest warrant. The state law in effect during the relevant events in <em>Robinson </em>was repealed in 1970 and replaced with the New York Criminal Procedure law (McKinney 1981). The new statute provides that a criminal action is commenced \u201cby the filing of an accusatory instrument with a criminal court.\u201d <em>Id. </em>\u00a7 100.05. Arguably the charging document underlying the warrant on which O\u2019Hagan was arrested sufficed to trigger Sixth Amendment protection, but the matter is clouded by our decision in <em>United States v. Duvall, </em>537 F.2d 15 (2d Cir.1976), which held that the right to counsel attaches in federal cases upon arraignment before a magistrate and not upon an earlier arrest on a warrant supported by a complaint.</p>\n<p id=\"b991-11\">Though Chief Judge Motley ruled in this case that O\u2019Hagan\u2019s right to counsel had attached at the time he was questioned by Soto, she acknowledged that the continued vitality of <em>Robinson </em>was \u201cunclear\u201d in the wake of <em>Duvall. O\u2019Hagan v. Soto, </em>523 F.Supp. 625 (S.D.N.Y.1981). That very uncertainty, which we do not resolve in this decision, is pertinent to Soto\u2019s claim of qualified immunity. Now that the Supreme Court has made the objective component of the qualified immunity defense paramount, <em>Harlow v. Fitzgerald, </em>457 U.S. 800, 817-19, 102 S.Ct. 2727, 2738-2739, 73 L.Ed.2d 396 (1982), a defendant is entitled to prevail when his conduct does not violate \u201cclearly established\u201d rights, <em>id. </em>at 818, 102 S.Ct. at 2739. <em>See Procunier v. Navarette, </em>434 U.S. 555, 565, 98 S.Ct. 855, 861, 55 L.Ed.2d 24 (1978); <em>Woods v. Strickland, </em>420 U.S. 308, 321, 95 S.Ct. 992, 1000, 43 L.Ed.2d 214 (1975); <em>Engblom v. Carey, </em>No. 83-7707, 724 F.2d 28 (2d Cir. Dec. 20, 1983). Though the Sixth Amendment right to counsel is well established, the uncertainty as to whether it had attached at the time Soto questioned O\u2019Hagan entitles Soto to resist liability on the basis of qualified immunity.<footnotemark>3</footnotemark> For this reason, the judgment against him must be reversed.<footnotemark>4</footnotemark></p>\n<p id=\"b991-12\">Appellant\u2019s claim for an award of counsel fees and his lawyer\u2019s request that critical <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"880\">*880</page-number>remarks of the District Judge be expunged are denied.<footnotemark>5</footnotemark></p>\n<p id=\"b992-4\">The judgment is reversed and the cause remanded with directions to dismiss the complaint. No costs.</p>\n<footnote label=\"1\">\n<p id=\"b990-16\">. The difference in outcome from the award of the first jury may have resulted from the fact <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"879\">*879</page-number>that Soto, who had not been a witness at the first trial, testified at the second trial and sharply disputed O\u2019Hagan\u2019s version of the episode.</p>\n</footnote>\n<footnote label=\"2\">\n<p id=\"b991-7\">. The $1 award was a remittitur accepted in lieu of yet a third damage trial. In view of our holding, <em>infra, </em>that Soto has a complete defense to liability, we need not decide whether the $1 would have been properly awarded as a remit-titur or whether the District Court would have had the authority, notwithstanding the second jury\u2019s award of no compensatory damages, to award $1 as nominal damages, <em>see Carey v. Piphus, </em>435 U.S. 247, 266-67, 98 S.Ct. 1042, 1053-54, 55 L.Ed.2d 252 (1978), without encountering a Seventh Amendment obstacle, <em>see Diznick v. Schiedt, </em>293 U.S. 474, 486, 55 S.Ct. 296, 301, 79 L.Ed. 603 (1935).</p>\n<p id=\"b991-13\">The $1 is the only sum at issue. O\u2019Hagan\u2019s motion for counsel fees as the prevailing party in the District Court was denied as untimely. The motion was filed four months after the deadline set by the District Court.</p>\n</footnote>\n<footnote label=\"3\">\n<p id=\"b991-14\">. Though Soto did not plead qualified immunity as an affirmative defense in his answer, the record reveals that he vigorously sought to assert the defense thereafter, and the defense was not rejected as untimely.</p>\n</footnote>\n<footnote label=\"4\">\n<p id=\"b991-15\">. The sufficiency of the qualified immunity defense makes it unnecessary to consider whether a Sixth Amendment violation occurs when no incriminating statement is obtained. <em>Cf. Weatherford v. Bursey, </em>429 U.S. 545, 97 S.Ct. 837, 51 L.Ed.2d 30 (1977).</p>\n</footnote>\n<footnote label=\"5\">\n<p id=\"b992-17\">. Chief Judge Motley properly ruled that even if Soto were the prevailing party, there were not presented the circumstances that might warrant an award of attorney\u2019s fees to a successful defendant. <em>See Nemeroff v. Abelson, </em>704 F.2d 652 (2d Cir.1983).</p>\n</footnote>\n</opinion>\n</casebody>\n",
