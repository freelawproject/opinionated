To aid in its consideration the court would like information concerning whether, given the claimant\u2019s physical ability, education, and work experience (as determined by the Secretary or as alleged on appeal by the claimant), the regulations deny assistance to a person in the claimant\u2019s age group but grant assistance to a person in an older age group. The court also desires a statement addressing whether the claimant can establish that his diminished capacity to adapt to a new work environment is equivalent to that which the regulations presume persons in an older age to have.</p>\n<p id=\"b1385-18\">Comment by a claimant should include the following information:</p>\n<blockquote id=\"b1385-19\">(1) The Secretary\u2019s classification of the claimant\u2019s physical ability, education, and work experience and, where the claimant disputes the Secretary\u2019s classification, the allegedly proper classification.</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b1385-20\">(2) The claimant\u2019s age.</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b1385-21\">(3) Whether, given the classification in (1), the current regulations deny assistance to a person in the claimant\u2019s age group but grant assistance to a person in an older age group.</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b1385-22\">(4) Whether the claimant can establish that his diminished ability to adapt to new jobs because of his age is the equivalent of that which persons in an older age group are presumed by the regulations to have.</blockquote>\n<p id=\"b1385-23\">After April 2, 1984, counsel are responsible for raising on their own motion the issue of the Secretary\u2019s treatment of age as a categorical factor. The mandate in this case is withdrawn for the purpose of issuing <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"1282\">*1282</page-number>this order. The mandate will be re-issued forthwith.</p>\n</opinion>\n</casebody>\n",
