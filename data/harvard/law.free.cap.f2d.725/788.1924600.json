Appellant characterized his action as a claim in the nature of mandamus. 28 U.S.C. \u00a7 1361 (1976 &amp; Supp. V). United States District Judge Louis F. Oberdorfer rejected appellant\u2019s characterization of the action and, instead, viewed appellant\u2019s claim as a petition for a substantive review of the merit pay rating that the Navy had assigned appellant. The district court found that it lacked jurisdiction to make such a substantive review pursuant to 5 U.S.C. \u00a7 5402(b)(2)(C) (1982), and therefore dismissed appellant\u2019s claim. We agree with the district court\u2019s characterization of appellant\u2019s claim and accordingly affirm its order of dismissal for lack of jurisdiction.</p>\n<p id=\"b901-5\">I. Background</p>\n<p id=\"b901-6\">In 1979, the United States Department of the Navy announced that it would implement the merit pay provisions of the Civil Service Reform Act (CSRA), 5 U.S.C. \u00a7\u00a7 5401-5405 (1982), beginning with the 1980-1981 fiscal year. In December 1979, appellant filed a grievance requesting an accurate job description to ensure that he would be appropriately considered for a merit pay increase. Appellant\u2019s position was reclassified in May 1981, though the reclassification came long after the October 1980 deadline for inclusion in the 1980-1981 merit pay program. To compensate for the delay, the Navy assigned appellant a \u201cpresumptive level 4\u201d as the basis for his evaluation in the 1980-1981 merit pay program. Appellant appealed this \u201cpresumptive rating\u201d through the Navy\u2019s administrative process. As final relief, appellant obtained a \u201cmodal rating\u201d for his merit pay system (MPS) group for the appraisal period ending on June 30, 1981.<footnotemark>1</footnotemark></p>\n<p id=\"b901-9\">In April 1982, appellant filed suit in the district court. He requested, <em>inter alia, </em>a mandamus order directing the Navy to review both the manner in which his grievance was processed and the impact that processing had on his performance rating. <em>Bright v. Lehman, </em>No. 82-1036 (D.D.C. Apr. 14, 1982) Complaint, Joint Appendix (J.A.) at 39-40. Appellant asserted jurisdiction for the mandamus claim under 28 U.S.C. \u00a7 1361.<footnotemark>2</footnotemark></p>\n<p id=\"b901-10\">The district court rejected appellant\u2019s characterization of the claim as one in the nature of mandamus and concluded that it lacked jurisdiction under section 1361 to hear the action. The district court rejected appellant\u2019s characterization in part because it found that the Navy\u2019s decision to grant a modal rating as relief for the delay in reclassification was \u201cclearly within the statutory bounds of the CSRA and the discretion of the Navy administrators.\u201d <em>Bright v. Lehman, </em>No. 82-1036 (D.D.C. Oct. 29, 1982) Memorandum Opinion, J.A. at 15. Indeed, the Office of Personnel Management (OPM) has specifically suggested \u201cthat \u2018presumptive\u2019 or \u2018modal\u2019 MPS ratings and distributions would meet the regulatory requirement.\u201d Memorandum Opinion, J.A. at 16 (citing 45 Fed.Reg. 65497 (Oct. 3, 1980)). Since the Navy had followed the relevant statutory mandate, the district court reasoned that appellant\u2019s claim could not legitimately be construed as an action in the nature of mandamus. Memorandum Opinion, J.A. at 13-17.</p>\n<p id=\"b901-11\">The district court then examined the crux of appellant\u2019s claim and found that his actual concern was the substance of the Navy\u2019s decision not to grant him a merit pay increase for the year in which his job classification was in dispute. Memorandum Opinion, J.A. at 14. The court noted:</p>\n<blockquote id=\"b902-3\"><page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"790\">*790</page-number>[Stripped of its procedural trappings, [appellant\u2019s claim] ... challenges a merit pay determination, albeit a retroactive one. Having been afforded an administrative review of this determination by the Navy, [appellant] is barred from review in this Court by operation of the CSRA....</blockquote>\n<p id=\"b902-4\">Memorandum Opinion, J.A. at 19. Because appellant was essentially requesting review of the merits of the Navy\u2019s decision, the district court held that it was barred from hearing appellant\u2019s claim.</p>\n<p id=\"b902-5\">Judge Oberdorfer\u2019s decision that the court was without jurisdiction to review appellant\u2019s substantive claim rested on 5 U.S.C. \u00a7 5402(b)(2)(C). This section, in pertinent part, provides that \u201c[determinations to provide pay increases under this subsection ... shall be subject to review only in accordance with and to the extent provided by procedures established by the head of the agency.. .. \u201d Memorandum Opinion, J.A. at 13. The district court concluded that 5 U.S.C. \u00a7 5402(b)(2)(C) was intended to apply to \u201c \u2018a determination to either increase <em>or not increase </em>the pay\u2019 of a covered employee.\u201d Memorandum Opinion, J.A. at 13 (quoting S.Rep. No. 95-969, 95th Cong., 2d Sess. 90 (1978) U.S.Code Cong. &amp; Admin. News 1978, pp. 2723, 2812 (emphasis added)). Appellant\u2019s claim, thus viewed as an appeal from a determination not to increase his pay, was dismissed for lack of jurisdiction.</p>\n<p id=\"b902-6\">II. Discussion</p>\n<p id=\"b902-7\">We agree with the district court\u2019s characterization of appellant\u2019s alleged mandamus claim. Count III of appellant\u2019s complaint asserts that \u201cdefendants had an affirmative duty to properly classify plaintiff\u2019s position, as well as develop appropriate standards and criteria under the merit pay system.\u201d Complaint, J.A. at 39. Appellant then requested the district court to</p>\n<blockquote id=\"A3z\">order the defendants to undertake a <em>complete review </em>and <em>update </em>of [appellant\u2019s] MPS rating for the appraisal period ending June 30,1981, and specifically include within such review an analysis of the impact which the delay in processing [appellant\u2019s] initial grievance had on the development of [appellant\u2019s] MPS rating, establish the review criteria for evaluation of [appellant\u2019s] performance and compute the MPS entitlement of [appellant].</blockquote>\n<p id=\"b902-10\"><em>Id. </em>at 40 (emphasis added).</p>\n<p id=\"b902-11\">Appellant\u2019s petition plainly requests the district court to vacate the relief already afforded appellant and to order the Navy to reappraise for the third time appellant\u2019s MPS rating. This relief is tantamount to second-guessing a discretionary decision of the Navy that fell within the bounds of governing statutes and regulations.<footnotemark>3</footnotemark> Such review by the district court would violate the jurisdictional restrictions set forth in 5 U.S.C. \u00a7 5402(b)(2)(C). We will not allow appellant to circumvent the appeals procedure defined by Congress simply by casting a mandamus label on his claim.<footnotemark>4</footnotemark></p>\n<p id=\"b902-12\">We emphasize that the district court did not hold that no action in the nature of mandamus could ever lie against the head of an agency regarding merit pay system ratings. Judge Oberdorfer explicitly noted that appellant\u2019s case \u201cis not [one] in which an agency has failed to provide <em>any </em>procedures for internal merit pay system reviews, which could arguably contravene \u00a7 5402(b)(2)(C).\u201d Memorandum Opinion, J.A. at 16 n. 9. Moreover, appellant did not allege that he was a victim of a <em>systematic </em><page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"791\">*791</page-number>denial of individual performance appraisals, or that as a matter of agency policy the Navy assigned presumptive or modal MPS ratings instead of individual performance appraisals.<footnotemark>5</footnotemark> Either action could arguably be construed as a deliberate deviation from the mandate of 5 U.S.C. \u00a7 4302 (1982) and 5 C.F.R. \u00a7\u00a7 430.203, 540.104 (1983). While we do not condone the Navy\u2019s unwarranted delay in handling appellant\u2019s reclassification, the modal rating assigned appellant was an acceptable remedy for what the record shows to be an isolated event.</p>\n<p id=\"b903-5\">We thus conclude the district court correctly characterized appellant\u2019s claim as a petition for a substantive review of the Navy\u2019s discretionary decision. Accordingly, we affirm the district court\u2019s finding that it was without jurisdiction to hear appellant\u2019s claim.</p>\n<p id=\"b903-6\">\n<em>Affirmed.</em>\n</p>\n<footnote label=\"1\">\n<p id=\"b901-7\">. The district court noted that the record does not clearly define either a \u201cpresumptive\u201d or a \u201cmodal\u201d rating, except that each is a substitute for a full performance appraisal. <em>Bright v. Lehman, </em>No. 82-1036 (D.D.C. Oct. 29, 1982) Memorandum Opinion, Joint Appendix (J.A.) at 8 n. 2. The district court also correctly noted, however, that an exhaustive understanding of these ratings and their effects in the evaluation process is not central to the jurisdictional issue at hand. <em>Id.</em></p>\n</footnote>\n<footnote label=\"2\">\n<p id=\"b901-13\">. 28 U.S.C. \u00a7 1361 (1976 and Supp. V) provides: \u201cThe district courts shall have original jurisdiction of any action in the nature of mandamus to compel an officer or employee of the United States or any agency thereof to perform a duty owed to the plaintiff.\u201d</p>\n</footnote>\n<footnote label=\"3\">\n<p id=\"b902-8\">. We agree with the district court that the Navy\u2019s decision to grant appellant a modal rating as a remedy for the delayed reclassification of his position was well within its statutory discretion. 5 U.S.C. \u00a7 4302 (1982), and 5 C.F.R. \u00a7\u00a7 540.104(h), 540.106(a)(3) (1983). <em>See supra </em>pages 789-790. This supports our conclusion that appellant\u2019s claim cannot fairly be characterized as an action in the nature of mandamus.</p>\n</footnote>\n<footnote label=\"4\">\n<p id=\"b902-13\">. Even if the Navy\u2019s granting appellant a \u201cmodal rating\u201d were somehow construed as a \u201creduction in pay,\u201d jurisdiction still would not lie in the district court. Rather, appellant\u2019s appeal would have been with the Merit Systems Protection Board and then with the appropriate United States Court of Appeals. 5 U.S.C. \u00a7\u00a7 7512, 7513(d), 7701, 7703(b)(1) (1982).</p>\n</footnote>\n<footnote label=\"5\">\n<p id=\"b903-15\">. In <em>Carducci v. Regan, </em>714 F.2d 171, 175 (D.C. Cir.1983), this court outlined the circumstances under which the CSRA contemplated judicial review of nonconstitutional claims. We do not interpret that discussion to preclude all actions in the nature of mandamus. In fact, the court in <em>Carducci </em>indicated that judicial review would be available to ensure that administrative review proceedings conformed to statutory mandates. <em>Id. See also Cutts v. Fowler, </em>692 F.2d 138, 140 (D.C.Cir. 1982).</p>\n</footnote>\n</opinion>\n</casebody>\n",
