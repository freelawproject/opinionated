The district court rejected the appellants\u2019 challenges to these practices on the basis of their facial unconstitutionality, and further held that the appellants\u2019 failure to formally and specifically take issue with the appellees\u2019 statement of material facts in their cross-motion for summary judgment justified granting that motion with regard to the constitutional challenges based on the operation of the assignment system. While we agree that the superior court\u2019s assignment system is not unconstitutional on its face, we reverse, in part, because we find that the district court erroneously concluded that no material issue of fact was involved as to the claim that the system\u2019s effect in practice is so burdensome on a small segment of the bar as to constitute a violation of those lawyers\u2019 fifth amendment rights.</p>\n<p id=\"b809-17\">I. Background</p>\n<p id=\"b809-18\">A. <em>The Appointment Practices</em></p>\n<p id=\"b809-19\">Since 1970, the D.C.Code has provided that in child neglect and parental termination proceedings<footnotemark>2</footnotemark> both parents and children <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"698\">*698</page-number>must be provided with appointed counsel if the parents are financially unable to obtain adequate representation. The relevant statute reads:</p>\n<blockquote id=\"b810-4\">(1) When a child is alleged to be neglected or when the termination of the parent and child relationship is under consideration, the parent, guardian or custodian of the child named in the petition or in a motion to terminate is entitled to be represented by counsel at all critical stages of the proceedings, and, if financially unable to obtain adequate representation, to have counsel appointed in accordance with rules established by the Superior Court of the District of Columbia.</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b810-5\">(2) ... The Division shall in every case involving a neglected child which results in a judicial proceeding, including the termination of the parent and child relationship ..., appoint a guardian ad litem who is an attorney to represent the child in such proceedings.<footnotemark>3</footnotemark></blockquote>\n<p id=\"b810-6\">Until October 1,1982, no funds were available to pay counsel appointed to represent indigent parents in neglect cases.<footnotemark>4</footnotemark> Since then, limited funds have been appropriated for this purpose.<footnotemark>5</footnotemark> Presently, counsel for both children and parents in neglect proceedings are paid $30 for each court appearance. Attorney compensation, however, is ' subject to the following limits: $100 per child-neglect case until disposition of the neglect petition; $60 for each review of a child-custody placement pursuant to a finding of neglect if the review is within two years of the original neglect disposition or if the child is under 6 years old; $30 for all other reviews; $100 for termination proceedings. Letter from the Honorable Gladys Kessler, <em>supra </em>note 4. No funds are provided for expert witnesses or investigative services.</p>\n<p id=\"b810-12\">Superior court rules implementing the statutory mandate that counsel be appointed to represent indigent parents provide:</p>\n<blockquote id=\"AcY\">Assignment of counsel shall be made by the Division from a list of attorneys prepared and maintained by the Division. Separate counsel shall be assigned to represent a child alleged to be neglected and his parents, guardian or custodian whenever they are financially unable to obtain adequate representation. In cases where the child and his parents, guardian or custodian are financially able to obtain adequate representation but have not retained counsel, the Division may appoint separate counsel and order the payment of reasonable attorneys\u2019 fees in accordance with SCR-Neglect 27 or may appoint counsel for the child and direct his parents, guardian or custodian to retain private counsel for themselves within a specified period of time. In making appointments the Division shall wherever possi<page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"699\">*699</page-number>ble obtain the same attorneys, if any, who represented the child and the child\u2019s parents, guardian or custodian in previous appearances before the Division.</blockquote>\n<p id=\"b811-4\">D.C. S.C.R.-Neglect 20(b). In practice, counsel are appointed to represent indigent parents from a list of lawyers who, during the previous month, have requested assignments of juvenile delinquency cases for which compensation is provided under the District of Columbia\u2019s Criminal Justice Act (CJA).<footnotemark>6</footnotemark> This list is maintained by the D.C. Public Defender Service.</p>\n<p id=\"b811-5\">When an attorney registers for compensated CJA work in the Family Division, he is notified that he may be appointed to neglect cases on a <em>pro bono publico </em>basis. Affidavit of W. Anthony Fitch, Deputy Director of the Public Defender Service for the District of Columbia (Oct. 20, 1982). The Public Defender Service and the judges of the superior court repeatedly warn attorneys that they will not be appointed to CJA-compensated cases if they do not also agree to represent indigent parents in neglect proceedings.</p>\n<p id=\"b811-6\">B. <em>The Superior Court Proceeding</em></p>\n<p id=\"b811-7\">David Sitomer, an individual attorney-appellant in this case, as the appointed attorney for parents in two neglect proceedings, filed a motion in superior court seeking administrative relief and compensation for services. He alleged that his uncompensated appointment as parents\u2019 counsel in many neglect proceedings was confiscatory and an unconstitutional \u201ctaking\u201d of his property without just compensation. <em>See In the Matters of N.P. and L.W., </em>Nos. 404-79, 418-79 (D.C.Super.Ct. June 14, 1982). Superior Court Judge Block ordered Sitomer to present evidence on how the appointment system in neglect cases actually worked and what its effect on appointed lawyers was. Judge Block also denied petitions to intervene in the proceeding filed by thirteen other lawyers, including the two individual appellants in this case, and by Sitomer in his capacity as President of the Family Division Trial Lawyers Association. Addressing Sitomer\u2019s individual claim, the court concluded that \u201cit simply cannot be said that Mr. Sitomer\u2019s neglect caseload was so excessively burdensome that he was compelled to foresake his regular law practice. Likewise the evidence relating more generally to the practices of the Family Division does not reveal a system so noxious as to violate Mr. Sitomer\u2019s constitutional rights.\u201d <em>Id. </em>at 3-4. Although Judge Block found no violation of Sitomer\u2019s constitutional rights, he did find the practice by which counsel for parties in neglect cases is appointed was inadequate and unfair in several respects:</p>\n<blockquote id=\"b811-10\">While it is obvious that this practice has been bureaucratically expedient, it is just as clear that it has insured neither the delivery of the appropriate level of representation to all parties in neglect actions nor equitably distributed the burdens of <em>pro bono </em>representations among those attorneys who practice before the Family Division. Accordingly, the neglect appointment list should be expanded beyond its present scope.</blockquote>\n<p id=\"b811-11\"><em>Id. </em>at 5.</p>\n<p id=\"b811-12\">Initially, Sitomer appealed the superior court decision denying him relief, but later voluntarily abandoned that appeal claiming he could not afford a transcript and other costs of the appeal. The other appellants <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"700\">*700</page-number>appealed the district court\u2019s denial of intervention but they too abandoned their appeals claiming insufficient funds to cover court costs. <em>See </em>Order Dismissing Appeals, <em>In re N.P., Jr., </em>No. 82-908 (D.C.Ct.App. Aug. 14, 1983); Motion to Withdraw Appeal, <em>In re N.P., Jr., </em>No. 82-908 (D.C.Ct. App. June 15, 1983).</p>\n<p id=\"b812-4\">C. <em>The District Court Decision</em></p>\n<p id=\"b812-5\">Before moving to withdraw their appeals in the D.C. Court of Appeals, Sitomer and the other lawyers, along with the Family Division Trial Lawyers Association, filed a new complaint in federal district court alleging that the practices by which the superior court assigns counsel to represent parents in neglect proceedings constitutes involuntary servitude and a \u201ctaking\u201d of property without just compensation because it requires attorneys to work for nothing. They also claimed that placing the burden of representing indigent parents exclusively on Family Division attorneys who depend on CJA-compensated cases rather than spreading it among other D.C. bar members or even other non-Family Division CJA-compensated attorneys amounts to so disproportionate a burden as, to constitute a \u201ctaking\u201d as well as a denial of equal protection of the law, in violation of the fifth amendment. The appellants seek damages for past financial losses for uncompensated appointments and an injunction against further inadequately compensated appointments.</p>\n<p id=\"b812-6\">The district court dismissed the thirteenth amendment and \u201ctaking\u201d claims stating, first, that compelled public service is not, in and of itself, involuntary servitude, even when imposed on a limited segment of the population. Specifically, requiring attorneys to take <em>pro bono </em>cases is neither involuntary servitude nor a <em>per se </em>\u201ctaking.\u201d</p>\n<p id=\"b812-7\">The district court acknowledged, however, that if a system of compulsory assignments without pay sufficiently burdened individual attorneys so that their ability to earn a livelihood was endangered, it could constitute a prohibitive \u201ctaking\u201d of property. The court, however, noted that Local Rule l-9(h) allows a court to \u201cassume that the facts as claimed by the moving party in his statement of material facts are admitted to exist except as and to the extent that such facts are controverted in a statement filed in opposition to the motion.\u201d D.D.C.Civ.R. l-9(h). Because the appellants filed no specific refutation of the material facts cited in the appellees\u2019 motion for summary judgment \u2014 that \u201cneglect cases do not usually require substantial ... efforts,\u201d and \u201cthe burden placed on an attorney by neglect appointments does not impair the attorney\u2019s ability to engage in remunerative practice\u201d \u2014 and because the appellants\u2019 cross-motion for summary judgment, filed in lieu of the opposition required by Rule l-9(h), did not specifically allege that the superior court appointment system unduly burdened them, the district court granted the appellees\u2019 motion for summary judgment on the \u201ctaking\u201d issue. <em>See Family Division Trial Lawyers of the Superior Court of the District of Columbia, Inc. v. Moultrie, </em>No. 82-1373, slip op. at 7-8 (Dec. 20, 1982).</p>\n<p id=\"b812-9\">Finally, the district court held that the appellants\u2019 complaint did not state a claim for violation of the equal protection clause. It reasoned that \u201cit is entirely rational to select lawyers who have expressed an interest in Family Division appointments to take on neglect cases; lawyers who request appointment to Family Division actions may be presumed to be more experienced in family legal issues and therefore may be presumed capable of providing more skilled counsel.\u201d <em>Id. </em>at 10.</p>\n<p id=\"b812-10\">II. Abstention</p>\n<p id=\"b812-11\">In addition to their argument that the grant of summary judgment in their favor was correct, the appellees also maintain that the district court should have abstained from deciding the merits of the appellants\u2019 claims at all. The appellees say that any federal court decision in this case directly interferes with and undermines local judicial proceedings involving important \u201cstate\u201d interests in which the appellants\u2019 <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"701\">*701</page-number>constitutional claims could have been raised and adequately dealt with. They argue that the progeny of <em>Younger v. Harris, </em>401 U.S. 37, 91 S.Ct. 746, 27 L.Ed.2d 669 (1971), applying its principle of equitable abstention by federal courts to civil as well as criminal proceedings in state courts, should control here.<footnotemark>7</footnotemark> We agree, in the main, with appellees\u2019 position that in the great majority of cases local courts should be free to follow their own schemes of judicial administration, unfettered by directives from the federal courts. However, local judicial administration is not immune from attacks in federal court on the ground that some of its practices violate federal constitutional rights. <em>See District of Columbia Court of Appeals v. Feldman, </em>\u2014 U.S. \u2014, 103 S.Ct. 1303, 75 L.Ed.2d 206 (1983) (claim that D.C. bar admission requirement that applicants graduate from an accredited law school is unconstitutional presents a federal question). In this case, we find that the <em>Younger </em>abstention doctrine, developed to prevent undue federal court interference in local judicial administration, does not apply to bar the district court\u2019s consideration of the appellants\u2019 constitutional challenges.</p>\n<p id=\"b813-7\"><em>Younger </em>held that a federal court should abstain from entertaining suits raising constitutional issues if the federal plaintiff is a defendant in a pending state criminal proceeding and the defendant can raise those issues in state court as defenses to his prosecution. Federalism and comity lie behind <em>Younger: </em>federal courts should respect state courts\u2019 abilities to adjudicate federal constitutional rights where adjudication of those rights will arise normally in the course of the pending state court proceeding. <em>See Trainor v. Hernandez, </em>431 U.S. 434, 441, 97 S.Ct. 1911, 1916, 52 L.Ed.2d 486 (1977). Permitting federal courts to entertain separate.suits involving these federal claims while the state action is pending would not only result in duplicative legal proceedings but might produce the uncomfortable spectacle of federal injunctions prohibiting a state from enforcing its own criminal law or the decisions that emanate from its own state courts. <em>See Huffman v. Pursue, Ltd., </em>420 U.S. 592, 602-03, 95 S.Ct. 1200, 1207-08, 43 L.Ed.2d 482 (1975) (citing <em>Steffel v. Thompson, </em>415 U.S. 452, 462, 94 S.Ct. 1209, 1217, 39 L.Ed.2d 505 (1974)); <em>Kaplan v. Hess, </em>694 F.2d 847, 851 (D.C.Cir. 1982). The only justification for federal court interference during a state proceeding would be a premise that the state courts cannot be trusted to adequately protect federal constitutional rights, a premise unequivocally rejected by the <em>Younger </em>Court. <em>See Middlesex County Ethics Committee v. Garden State Bar Assoc., </em>457 U.S. 423, 431, 102 S.Ct. 2515, 2521, 73 L.Ed.2d 116 (1982); <em>Kaplan, </em>694 F.2d at 851.</p>\n<p id=\"b813-11\">Since its promulgation, the <em>Younger </em>doctrine has been extended beyond criminal proceedings to cover pending civil actions in state courts. It is noteworthy, however, that virtually all post- <em>Younger </em>cases have involved collateral attacks in federal court on state enforcement proceedings <em>brought against the federal plaintiff.</em><footnotemark><em>8</em></footnotemark><em> </em>Thus, <em>Huffman, </em>420 U.S. 592, 95 S.Ct. 1200, upon which the appellees heavily rely, involved an attack in federal courts on the constitution<page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"702\">*702</page-number>ality of a state nuisance statute used to shut down theatres showing obscene movies, where the state had already brought an action under that statute to close the theatres. Similarly, <em>Juidice v. Vail, </em>430 U.S. 327, 97 S.Ct. 1211, 51 L.Ed.2d 376 (1977), involved a collateral attack on the constitutionality of civil contempt proceedings brought by the state against judgment debtors who disobeyed subpoenas. <em>See also Trainor </em>v. <em>Hernandez, </em>431 U.S. 434, 97 S.Ct. 1911, 52 L.Ed.2d 486 (refusing to decide the constitutionality of a state attachment proceeding brought to recover money from public assistance recipients who allegedly concealed assets).</p>\n<p id=\"b814-4\">There is good reason why the <em>Younger </em>abstention policy is best suited to cases where federal plaintiffs are trying to attack state enforcement procedures which have been directly applied to them. For, in such cases, the state has brought the federal plaintiffs before its own courts to protect important policy and resource interests and in such cases the plaintiffs\u2019 federal action are perceived as attempts to divert or circumvent state court adjudication. The need or wisdom of extending <em>Younger </em>to all constitutional claims that <em>might </em>be adjudicated in state as well as federal courts, however, is far more problematical. This extension would make federal courts cin-derellas to their sister state courts in adjudicating federal constitutional rights, their native area of competence and jurisdiction. And it would prevent plaintiffs from exercising their traditional choice of bringing constitutional claims in either forum, even where there is no strong state interest in how or where the claims are decided. <em>See Steffel v. Thompson, </em>415 U.S. at 462-63, 94 S.Ct. at 1217-18; <em>Monroe v. Pape, </em>365 U.S. 167, 183, 81 S.Ct. 473, 481, 5 L.Ed.2d 492 (1961).</p>\n<p id=\"b814-8\"><em>Moore v. Sims, </em>442 U.S. 415, 99 S.Ct. 2371, 60 L.Ed.2d 994 (1979), represents the outer limit to which the Supreme Court has extended <em>Younger </em>abstention. <em>Moore </em>held that a federal court should not entertain a parent\u2019s constitutional challenge to the state practice of removing suspected child abuse victims from parental custody without notice pending a hearing on the abuse charge. While the parent\u2019s challenge to the interim removal procedure was not technically a defense to any charge of child abuse, the temporary removal policies were inextricably tied up with the state interest in protection of its children, the very <em>raison d\u2019etre </em>for the abuse proceedings. <em>See Moore, </em>442 U.S. at 430 n. 12, 99 S.Ct. at 2380 n. 12 (claiming that hinging abstention doctrine on whether federal issue is a \u201cdefense\u201d to state proceeding is a mere \u201csemantic joust\u201d). And, there was no question the parents could raise the constitutional issue in the course of their abuse proceedings.</p>\n<p id=\"b814-9\">This case falls outside the <em>Moore </em>perimeters, and hence we find abstention to be inappropriate. Except for Sitomer, the plaintiff-appellants were not parties to any pending suit in the local courts in which their constitutional challenges could naturally be resolved.<footnotemark>9</footnotemark> The District has brought no proceedings against any of these appellants. This alone distinguishes the case from the reach of <em>Younger </em>situations. <em>See, e.g., Kaplan </em>v. <em>Hess, </em>694 F.2d at 851 <em>(Younger </em>not applicable because no pending proceeding in case where appellants challenged a local court rule requiring them to stand when judges enter or leave the courtroom); <em>New Jersey-Philadelphia Presbytery of the Bible Presbyterian Church v. New </em><page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"703\">*703</page-number><em>Jersey State Board of Higher Education, </em>654 F.2d 868 (3d Cir.1981) <em>(Younger </em>did not bar non-parties to state enforcement proceedings against unlicensed college\u2019s operation from bringing federal suit to enjoin state from continuing enforcement efforts); <em>see also Doran v. Salem Inn, Inc., </em>422 U.S. 922, 95 S.Ct. 2561, 45 L.Ed.2d 648 (1975) (plaintiffs who refrained from criminal activity \u2014 employing topless dancers \u2014 are not barred by <em>Younger </em>from bringing a federal challenge to the criminal statute, although other plaintiffs who committed the crime, and who were represented by common counsel, with similar business activities and problems were barred by pending state criminal proceedings). In addition, the individual neglect cases in which the appellants are counsel are questionable vehicles at best for raising their constitutional claims. The local court here has already said so when it denied intervention by other attorneys in Sitomer\u2019s proceeding. It noted:</p>\n<blockquote id=\"b815-5\">By their very nature neglect proceedings contemplate issues centering on the care of a child by his or her parent. If need be \u201crelated matters involving the same family or household\u201d can be consolidated. SCR-Neglect 2 &amp; 3(b). Anything broader is inconsistent with the nature of the proceedings.</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b815-6\">Mr. Sitomer\u2019s claims touched on issues affecting his representation of parties in the above-captioned cases, but intervention by other attorneys would completely separate the cases from their roots in the original complaints of neglect. <em>In this instance we have already strained the bounds of the neglect proceeding </em>and we cannot allow it to bear the burden of what would amount to an informal class action. Moreover, <em>the Court notes that, in fact, a class action suit has been filed recently in U.S. District Court. That suit will surely provide a better forum for presenting the claims of the attorneys than can be obtained by any bootstrapping efforts here.</em></blockquote>\n<p id=\"b815-7\"><em>In the Matters of N.P. and L.W., </em>slip op. at 2-3 (emphasis supplied). Consistent with the superior court\u2019s reasoning, we find that <em>Younger </em>does not apply to bar claims that are so ancillary to arguably related local court proceedings that even the local court finds the claims disruptive of the resolution of core issues in those proceedings.</p>\n<p id=\"b815-9\">Appellees additionally contend that any relief for the appellants would require the federal courts to interfere in the superior court administration of appointment of counsel in neglect cases. Therefore, even if <em>Younger </em>abstention is technically inappo-site, the district court should stay its hand in this case under the principle discussed in <em>O\u2019Shea v. Littleton, </em>414 U.S. 488, 94 S.Ct. 669, 38 L.Ed.2d 674 (1974), that a federal district court should not consider a claim where granting the prayer for relief would require the federal court to monitor day-today operations of the local courts.</p>\n<p id=\"b815-10\">This case, however, is very different from <em>O\u2019Shea. </em>There, the plaintiffs \u2014 citizens of Cairo, Illinois, who organized and participated in an economic boycott of merchants purportedly engaged in racial discrimination \u2014 alleged a pattern and practice of racial discrimination in discretionary judicial conduct, including sentencing and setting bail, by a state judge and magistrate. The Court held that the plaintiffs had no standing to sue for injunctive relief since their claim asked the Court to presume future constitutional violations against them by state judicial officers. In addition the Court stated that any injunctive relief would violate the rationale of <em>Younger </em>since it would require federal courts to monitor the <em>day-to-day </em>operation of state judicial proceedings. <em>Id. </em>at 501-02, 94 S.Ct. at 678-79. The federal court would have had to directly review the state judge\u2019s and magistrate\u2019s decisions to see if they abused their discretion whenever they sentenced one of the plaintiffs, or set bail in a case involving a plaintiff. In this case, the appellants challenge a non-discretionary method of appointing uncompensated counsel because that method allegedly confiscates their opportunity to practice law. Although the challenged method is established by neither statute nor written rule, it indisputably operates more like a rule, a custom or a usage known to all participants in the <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"704\">*704</page-number>system, than a decision left to the local judiciary\u2019s discretion to be exercised on a case-by-case basis. It follows that if the rule is adjudicated to be unconstitutional, relief can be effected by requiring the superior court to adopt another \u201crule\u201d which more equitably divides the financial burdens attendant to provision of counsel for indigent parents in neglect proceedings. There is no foreseeable need for any \u201cmonitoring\u201d of its day-to-day operations. So, even if the <em>O\u2019Shea </em>\u201cmonitoring\u201d rationale were sufficient by itself to justify abstention, it would not apply here.</p>\n<p id=\"b816-4\">In sum, we are not unmindful of the District\u2019s stance that it has an important local interest in its neglect proceedings, <em>cf. Moore, </em>442 U.S. at 428, 99 S.Ct. at 2377 and that attorney-assignment practices initiated and administered by its judiciary play an important role in its scheme to enforce its neglect laws. But, that interest standing in isolation is not sufficient to block a federal court from considering a claim that the practices operate in an unconstitutional manner to burden unduly or unfairly a small segment of the bar. <em>See Feldman, </em>103 S.Ct. at 1316. In considering the merits of appellants\u2019 claims we see no potential for duplicative litigation, nor for irreverence toward the local courts, and no necessity that relief need interfere with the day-today operation of the superior court. Like the district court, we find abstention inappropriate in this case.</p>\n<p id=\"b816-5\">III. Sitomer\u2019s Claims</p>\n<p id=\"ayl-dedup-0\">We turn now to the merits of the summary judgment decision by the district court. We consider Sitomer\u2019s claims first. Sitomer has already brought and lost an action in superior court which adjudged on the merits several of the issues raised in this case. That court found that Sitomer suffered no constitutional injury prior to filing this suit. Hence, his claim for damages due to allegations that these past appointments abridged his constitutional rights is barred by <em>res judicata. See Kremer v. Chemical Construction Corp., </em>456 U.S. 461, 102 S.Ct. 1883, 72 L.Ed.2d 262 (1982); <em>cf. Allen v. McCurry, </em>449 U.S. 90, 101 S.Ct. 411, 66 L.Ed.2d 308 (1980) (applying collateral estoppel).</p>\n<p id=\"b816-9\">Whether <em>res judicata </em>also bars Sitomer\u2019s broader claims that the system is so unfair it inherently infringes on his constitutional rights, and therefore that he should receive no future neglect appointments, is a tougher question. While we might hesitate to invoke <em>res judicata </em>to bar Sitomer from litigating claims about future appointments that he could have brought but did not,<footnotemark>10</footnotemark> here the superior court judge actually entertained and rejected such claims. It found that the appointment practices of the Family Division are not generally \u201cso noxious as to violate Mr. Sitomer\u2019s constitutional rights.\u201d<footnotemark>11</footnotemark> <em>See In the Matters of N.P. and L.W., </em>slip op. at 4.

Constitutional Claims</p>\n<p id=\"b816-11\">A. <em>The Thirteenth Amendment</em></p>\n<p id=\"b816-12\">The other appellants seek to invalidate under the thirteenth amendment judicial appointments of counsel to represent parties where neither the parties nor the state adequately compensate the appointed attorneys for their services.<footnotemark>12</footnotemark> The <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"705\">*705</page-number>system by which the superior court appoints counsel to represent indigent parents, however, is not forced labor. An attorney who wishes to take no further assignments is free to either stop practicing before the Family Division, or even to continue to practice without taking CJA-compensated juvenile cases. Inability to avoid continued service is the essential ingredient of involuntary servitude. <em>See Flood v. Kuhn, </em>443 F.2d 264 (2d Cir.1971), aff'g 316 F.Supp. 271 (S.D.N.Y.1970), <em>aff\u2019d on other grounds, </em>407 U.S. 258, 92 S.Ct. 2099, 32 L.Ed.2d 728 (1972); <em>Wicks v. Southern Pacific Co., </em>231 F.2d 130, 138 (9th Cir.1956), <em>cert. denied, </em>351 U.S. 946, 76 S.Ct. 845, 100 L.Ed. 1471 (1956). Since the superior court appointment system lacks this ingredient, we agree with the district court that the appellants\u2019 complaint fails to raise a genuine thirteenth amendment issue.</p>\n<p id=\"b817-5\">B. <em>\u201cTaking\u201d of Property Without Just Compensation</em></p>\n<p id=\"b817-6\">The district court also rejected appellants\u2019 constitutional claim that requiring an attorney to perform traditional <em>pro bono </em>service amounts to a \u201ctaking\u201d of property. The leading case, <em>United States v. Dillon, </em>346 F.2d 633 (9th Cir.1965), <em>cert. denied, </em>382 U.S. 978, 86 S.Ct. 550, 15 L.Ed.2d 469 which the district court cited, makes clear the rationale behind the traditional service exception:</p>\n<blockquote id=\"b817-7\">The obligation of the legal profession to serve indigents on court order is an ancient and established tradition, and ... appointed counsel have generally been compensated, if at all, only by statutory fees which would be inadequate under just compensation principles, and which are usually payable only in limited types of cases. Further, ... the vast majority of the courts which have passed on the question have denied claims of appointed counsel for nonstatutory just compensation, pointing out that representation of indigents under court order, without a fee, is a condition under which lawyers are licensed to practice as officers of the court, and that the obligation of the legal profession to serve without compensation has been modified only by statute. An applicant for admission to practice law may justly be deemed to be aware of the traditions of the profession which he is joining, and to know that one of these traditions is that a lawyer is an officer of the court obligated to represent indigents for little or no compensation upon court order. Thus, the lawyer has consented to, and assumed, this obligation and when he is called upon to fulfill it, he cannot contend that it is a \u201ctaking of his services.\u201d</blockquote>\n<p id=\"b817-11\"><em>Id. </em>at 635; <em>see also DeRodulfa v. United States, </em>461 F.2d 1240, 1256 (D.C.Cir.1972) (dicta), <em>cert. denied, </em>409 U.S. 949, 93 S.Ct. 270, 34 L.Ed.2d 220; <em>Williamson v. Vardeman, </em>674 F.2d 1211, 1214 (8th Cir.1982); <em>White v. United States Pipe &amp; Foundry Co., </em>646 F.2d 203, 205 &amp; n. 3 (5th Cir. Unit B 1981). In this case, the argument that <em>pro bono </em>appointments are not <em>per se </em>\u201ctakings\u201d is bolstered by the repeated emphasis by the D.C. Public Defender Service and the superior court that CJA-compensated appointments open the appointed attorneys to the possibility of assignment of cases for no pay. Hence, appellants cannot now maintain that they had an expectation rising to the level of a property right that they would be compensated for their services. Although appellants do make a token claim that any uncompensated service required would be unconstitutional, we do not subscribe to such a position. Thus, there is no facial unconstitutionality to the statute or rules that require appointments in uncompensated cases.</p>\n<p id=\"b817-12\">While we agree with the district court that some <em>pro bono </em>requirements do not constitute a \u201ctaking,\u201d we think it equally clear that an unreasonable amount of required uncompensated service might so qualify. As the scope of the constitutionally mandated right to counsel has expanded, and the concomitant burden of providing <em>pro bono </em>representation imposed on attorneys has grown, several state courts have <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"706\">*706</page-number>recognized that at some point the burden on particular attorneys could become so excessive that it might rise to the level of a \u201ctaking\u201d of property. <em>See, e.g., People ex rel. Conn. v. Randolph, </em>35 Ill.2d 24, 219 N.E.2d 337 (1966); <em>Bias v. State, </em>568 P.2d 1269 (Okla.1977); <em>State ex rel. Partain v. Oakley, </em>227 S.E.2d 314 (W.Va.1976); <em>cf. Menin v. Menin, </em>79 Misc.2d 285, 359 N.Y.S.2d 721 (Sup.Ct.1974) (appointment of counsel in civil case not mandated since such appointment would abridge appointed attorneys\u2019 property rights). And, although the appellants here have no expectation of compensation for their services in appointed cases that rises to the level of a property interest, \u201cthe right to conduct a business and enter a profession is considered a property right within the meaning of various constitutional provisions.\u201d <em>Menin, </em>359 N.Y.S.2d at 729; <em>see also Board of Regents v. Roth, </em>408 U.S. 564, 574, 92 S.Ct. 2701, 2707, 33 L.Ed.2d 548 (1972) (if state denied terminated professor opportunity for all other public employment in state university, that might violate due process clause); <em>Schware v. Board of Bar Examiners, </em>353 U.S. 232, 77 S.Ct. 752, 1 L.Ed.2d 796 (1957) (due process applies to bar licensing, since that is state\u2019s grant of permission to engage in the occupation of lawyer); <em>Joint Anti Fascist Refugee Committee v. McGrath, </em>341 U.S. 123, 185, 71 S.Ct. 624, 655, 95 L.Ed. 817 (1951) (due process applies to denials of opportunity for future government employment). Thus, while the District may enact regulations that affect property interests, where those regulations unreasonably \u201cfrustrate distinct investment-backed expectations\u201d they may \u201camount to a \u2018taking.\u2019 \u201d <em>Penn Central Transportation Co. v. City of New York, </em>438 U.S. 104, 127, 98 S.Ct. 2646, 2660, 57 L.Ed.2d 631 (1978) (citing <em>Pennsylvania Coal Co. v. Mahon, </em>260 U.S. 393, 43 S.Ct. 158, 67 L.Ed. 322 (1922)). In short, if the superior court appointment system effectively denies the appellants the opportunity to maintain a remunerative practice as family lawyers before the Family Division, and that specialty practice is determined to be a \u201cproperty\u201d interest, it might effect an unconstitutional \u201ctaking.\u201d<footnotemark>13</footnotemark></p>\n<p id=\"b818-6\">The dissent and appellees argue that \u201cas a matter of law ... no level of burdensomeness could rise to the level of a taking as long as appellants have volun<page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"707\">*707</page-number>teered their services.\u201d Diss.Op. at 713; <em>see also </em>Brief for Appellees at 22-27. The dissent is anchored in the circumstance that \u201conly by their voluntarily seeking compensated cases were they [the Family Division lawyers] then required to take on uncompensated cases.\u201d Diss.Op. at 713. Although proving a \u201ctaking\u201d in a situation like this one is obviously a formidable task, we are not willing at this point to rule it out as a matter of law. A \u201ctaking\u201d might occur if the following crucial findings were made: First, the attorneys\u2019 expectations of pursuing the specialty practice of family law would have to be shown to be sufficiently established within the norms and traditions of legal practice to constitute a property interest. The dissent takes umbrage at the notion that a protected interest in a specialty practice could ever be legally recognized, although it admits that the practice of law generally might so qualify. <em>See </em>Diss.Op. at 714. We fail to see any inherent reason why the practice of law is protected by the takings clause but the practice of a legal specialty could <em>never </em>be protected. Surely, for instance, it is at best questionable whether the District could declare that henceforth all lawyers practicing before the Family Division may not accept any fees or compensation at all. We rule today only that the existence of a property interest in such practice is a matter calling for material factual development and argument in the district court, not one to be decided by appellate fiat in the absence of any record whatsoever. Second, the number of Family Division cases where the parties can pay for their own counsel would have to be limited enough so that withdrawing from the market of government compensated cases would effectively be a decision to withdraw altogether from practice before the Family Division,<footnotemark>14</footnotemark> contrary to the appellees\u2019 and dissent\u2019s suggestion that the appellants would be \u201cfree to decide whether to conform to the proposed specifications or withdraw from the government market.\u201d <em>See </em>Brief for Appellees at 23 (quoting <em>Control Data Corp. v. Baldridge, </em>655 F.2d 283, 293 (D.C.Cir.1981)); <em>see also </em>Diss.Op. at 713. Finally, the assignment of uncompensated neglect cases attached to \u201cvolunteering\u201d for CJA-compensated cases would have to be so burdensome that it effectively denies the appellants\u2019 ability to earn a living by practicing family law. The record is obviously not sufficiently developed at this point to allow such findings either to be made or entirely discounted.</p>\n<p id=\"b819-7\">The district court ruled for the appellees because it found that the appellants never alleged that the appointment system was sufficiently burdensome to prevent them from engaging in a remunerative practice. It did acknowledge that if the burden the neglect appointments imposed on the appellants was heavy enough their constitutional claims might be valid, but it relied on the appellees\u2019 assertions in their Statement of Material Facts that \u201cneglect cases do not usually require substantial research and investigation and most of the time is waiting time attributed to paying CJA cases,\u201d <em>Family Division Trial Lawyers, </em>slip op. at 7-8, to support its factual conclusion underlying summary judgment, that the burden \u201cdoes not impair the attorney\u2019s ability to engage in remunerative practice.\u201d <em>Id. </em>Our reading of the record, however, does not support the district court\u2019s conclusion that the linchpin fact of nonimpairment was not truly in contest.</p>\n<p id=\"b819-8\">The district court relied for that critical finding on the lack of a formal contravention to the appellees\u2019 Statement of Material Facts, as required by Rule 1-9(h). The appellants\u2019 failure, however, to file such a piece of paper is understandable, <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"708\">*708</page-number>in part at least, in view of the circumstance that the district court, <em>sua sponte, </em>ordered the parties to file cross-motions for summary judgment by a fixed date. Apparently, <em>both parties </em>assumed that the cross-motions would serve as a sufficient indication of what, if any, issues of material facts were still at issue.<footnotemark>15</footnotemark> We are therefore reluctant to affirm a grant of summary judgment based on a key fact which we believe to have been at issue, but which the district court found to be uncontroverted on the technical ground that the appellants had not complied with Rule l-9(h), where there is evidence that both parties believed they were permitted to file only simultaneous cross-motions, not responsive pleadings.</p>\n<p id=\"b820-4\">It is true that the appellants\u2019 own Statement of Material Facts did not specifically allege an unreasonable burden resulting from the assignment system, and that its formal motion for summary judgment repeated the boilerplate that there was no issue of material fact to be decided. We are also at a loss to understand why the appellants agreed at all to file cross-motions for summary judgment when the crux of their \u201ctaking\u201d and equal protection claims hinged on the factual issue of how heavy a burden had been imposed on them. Nonetheless, in the final analysis, we cannot in good conscience square the district court\u2019s finding that the appellants \u201cnowhere controverted\u201d the appellees\u2019 assertion that the neglect appointment system did not impose an undue burden with the record of the case before us, particularly when the appellants\u2019 Points and Authorities in Opposition to Defendants\u2019 Motion for Summary Judgment spent most of its ten pages contesting that critical fact.<footnotemark>16</footnotemark> Moreover, similar documents in the record reveal that the key fact of whether the Family Division Lawyers were unduly burdened was not only at the heart of this case, but was hotly contested from the start. <em>See, e.g., </em>Complaint at 7-8 (\u201cthe burden of representation has driven many attorneys to abandon juvenile practice\u201d); Points and Authorities in Support of Plaintiffs\u2019 Motion For Summary Judgment, at 7 (\u201c[t]he burden for some lawyers is staggering\u201d). No one reading these papers could come away with the impression that the appellants did not generally claim that the sheer number of nonpaying appointments was a great financial burden on them, or that if the burden was not perceived to be great, the case would have been brought in the first place.</p>\n<p id=\"b820-10\">But there is a more fundamental reason why we cannot accept the district court\u2019s grant of summary judgment. The stakes in this case are too great not only for the lawyers and court personnel but also for the <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"709\">*709</page-number>parents and children involved in neglect cases to let stand a judgment mistakenly entered without any judicial inquiry upon \u201cfacts\u201d \u2014 that representation of parents in neglect cases entails minimum time and effort and need exact no substantial premium in time or talent from legal advocates\u2014 which are widely perceived in the local bar and in the community at large, not to be true, and which have been the core of a decade-old controversy.<footnotemark>17</footnotemark> Such a judicial affirmation made without an adequate inquiry into these facts\u2019 truth or falsity would, we fear, invite disrespect of the courts and undermine the credibility of their procedures. As illustrative of the intensity and the high visibility of the controversy, we note a D.C. Bar report in which the present appointment system\u2019s inability to guarantee adequate representation to parents or adequate compensation to assigned lawyers is highlighted.<footnotemark>18</footnotemark> Since professional standards for adequate representation of parents in neglect and termination proceedings obviously require a great deal more than the token representation that the district court assumed neglect cases demand,<footnotemark>19</footnotemark> we do not think it proper for us to dismiss a constitutional claim on the ground that such efforts are all that is called for from assigned counsel. Too much is at stake for too many.</p>\n<p id=\"b821-8\">In short, the district court based its dismissal of the \u201ctakings\u201d claim specifically on a finding that the burden was not a heavy one; we remand for a more complete record on the precise extent of the burden as those services are currently performed and as they should be performed under adequate professional standards, as well as on the status of Family Division attorneys\u2019 expectations of carrying on practice in the Division and their need to rely on government compensated cases to do so.</p>\n<p id=\"b821-9\">C. <em>The Equal Protection Claim</em></p>\n<p id=\"ae-dedup-0\">The district court found that the decision to restrict <em>pro bono </em>appointments to lawyers hoping to receive CJA-compensated appointments was rational and it therefore dismissed this claim. We agree that the appellants\u2019 right to earn a living as lawyers is not so fundamental that <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"710\">*710</page-number>it triggers strict judicial scrutiny of the challenged system; if the system reflects a rational choice aimed at furthering legitimate state interests, a court must uphold it. <em>See Minnesota v. Clover Leaf Creamery Co., </em>449 U.S. 456, 461-64, 101 S.Ct. 715, 722-23, 66 L.Ed.2d 659 (1981); <em>United States Railroad Retirement Board v. Fritz, </em>449 U.S. 166, 174-76, 101 S.Ct. 453, 459-60, 66 L.Ed.2d 368 (1980). We also agree that the district court properly identified the state interest furthered by the appointment system as the guarantee of adequate representation for children and parents in neglect proceedings. But, we cannot conclude, based on the factual record developed thus far, that the District\u2019s choice to implement the system as it did \u2014 in particular its choice to restrict <em>pro bono </em>appointments to attorneys on the Public Defender Services list for CJA appointments in juvenile eases\u2014 was rational.</p>\n<p id=\"b822-4\">Arguments that the District acted rationally in presuming that lawyers who regularly practice before the Family Division are best able to represent parents in neglect proceedings, and in requiring more from recipients of the public fisc than from other attorneys, bring us no more than to the halfway mark in analyzing the appellants\u2019 equal protection claim. At some point, even initially rationally motivated restrictions on the pool of attorneys assigned <em>pro bono </em>cases may result in such enormous demands on the time and energy of these appointed attorneys that they cease to be rational either in the results they engender of ineffective representation for indigent parents, or the burdens they impose on the chosen attorneys:<footnotemark>20</footnotemark> For example, to require the one most experienced neglect lawyer in the local bar to take on all <em>pro bono </em>assignments would surely not survive even a rational means test. It is by no means clear from the sparse record before us whether this point has been reached or even approached. Since the constitutional claim at issue is the discriminatory application of the system, not just its design, further fact-finding is required.</p>\n<p id=\"b822-7\">We realize that since the appellants filed their complaint, the District has begun to pay small but not insignificant sums for representation of indigent parents in neglect proceedings.<footnotemark>21</footnotemark> This new factor could alter any assessment of the effects of restricting the pool of attorneys who are assigned <em>pro bono </em>neglect cases. But, as with the \u201ctakings\u201d issue, we remand for a more accurate assessment of the extent of the remaining burden on the appellants \u2014 to see if the classification meets the rational means test.</p>\n<p id=\"b822-8\">We emphasize that our remand is only to permit the district court to decide on a fuller record the constitutional issues involved in the application of the assigned counsel system \u2014 to elucidate the extent of the burden currently falling on family lawyer practitioners, as well as what that burden would be if they performed their chores in accordance with professional standards. Administration of the local court system is a province we enter hesitantly. We are all too aware of the financial dilemma that the local court system faces in trying to provide assigned counsel for indigent litigants. We assume a great deal of deference must be given to its attempts to keep the system afloat without violating the constitutional and statutory rights of children, parents, or lawyers. At this juncture, however, we feel compelled, as did the district court, to entertain the constitutional claims of the allegedly aggrieved lawyers. Right now, we merely require that a first cut on their claims be made on an adequate record. In the event that any of those claims are upheld, we expect much deference by the district court and much participation by the <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"711\">*711</page-number>local judiciary in formulating an equitable remedy.</p>\n<p id=\"b823-5\">Conclusion</p>\n<p id=\"b823-6\">For the reasons set out above, we reverse the decision of the district court in part, affirm it in part, and remand this case for further proceedings.</p>\n<p id=\"b823-7\">\n<em>It is so ordered.</em>\n</p>\n<footnote label=\"1\">\n<p id=\"b809-13\">.

We believe Parker stretches beyond <em>O\u2019Shea, </em>however, in refusing to consider constitutional challenges to regularized local court practices like failure to appoint counsel whose relief would not require the kind of oversight of inherently discretionary decision-making practices, like setting bail and parole, involved in <em>O\u2019Shea.</em></p>\n</footnote>\n<footnote label=\"9\">\n<p id=\"b814-5\">.

Counsel for parents are <em>drafted </em>on an involuntary basis from the pool of attorneys who pick up juvenile and PINS cases under the CJA program. Drafted attorneys are required to take uncompensated neglect cases as a precondition to receiving Criminal Justice Act fee generating juvenile delinquency appointments, which in many cases provide the attorneys\u2019 livelihood. There are only one hundred attorneys and some 600 neglect cases are petitioned each year. A number of these cases have two parents each requiring separate counsel. As these cases stay in the system for years, many attorneys have very high neglect caseloads. The result of this situation is that the quality of representation of parents is very low although the societal cost and the stakes for all concerned are higher than for many criminal cases for which paid counsel is available. Additionally, the Courtroom hearing calendars back up because of the conflicing [sic] schedules of the attorneys. One-third to one-half of the continu-anees in neglect cases are granted at the request of the defense attorney. The Court Study Committee finds no justification for continuing this system of inadequate representation.</p>\n<p id=\"b821-11\">Neglect Report, <em>supra </em>note 14, at 36 (emphasis in original) (footnote omitted).</p>\n</footnote>\n<footnote label=\"19\">\n<p id=\"b821-12\">. <em>Compare Family Division Trial Lawyers, </em>slip op. at 7 (\u201c[n]eglect cases do not usually require substantial research and investigation efforts\u201d) <em>with Lassiter, </em>452 U.S. at 30, 101 S.Ct. at 2161 (\u201cthe ultimate issues with which a termination hearing deals are not always simple, however commonplace they may be.

In my view the District Court was entirely correct in granting summary judgment in this case. The majority\u2019s ruling mandates further proceedings on constitutional claims that, as a matter of law, should be and properly were rejected. Moreover, the court\u2019s ruling inappropriately erodes the stringent adherence to District Court Local Rule l-9(h) required under this court\u2019s rulings in <em>Gardels v. CIA, </em>637 F.2d 770, 773 (D.C.Cir.1980) and <em>Tarpley v. Greene, </em>684 F.2d 1, 6-7 (D.C.Cir.1982).</p>\n<p id=\"b823-10\">As fully recounted by the majority opinion, this suit was brought against the Chief Judge of the Superior Court of the District of Columbia, the Public Defender Service, and the District of Columbia, alleging that the Family Division appointment process violates the thirteenth amendment\u2019s prohibition against involuntary servitude, the fifth amendment\u2019s prohibition against the taking of private property without just compensation, and the equal protection component of the fifth amendment. The district court granted summary judgment in favor of the defendants, rejecting appellants\u2019 thirteenth and fifth amendment claims and holding that the system of attorney appointments \u201cdoes not so burden the CJA attorneys that it amounts to a constitutional violation.\u201d<footnotemark>1</footnotemark> Memorandum Opinion at 8. The district court also rejected appellants\u2019 equal protection claims, holding that selecting attorneys who regularly practice before the Family Division to represent indigent parents in Family Division neglect cases is \u201centirely rational.\u201d <em>Id. </em>at 10.</p>\n<p id=\"b823-14\">In my view, the majority errs in two respects.<footnotemark>2</footnotemark> First, as a matter of law, appellants\u2019 thirteenth amendment, fifth amendment, and equal protection claims are utterly without merit. Second, even assuming, as I do not, that burdensomeness is a relevant inquiry as to the due process claim, appellants nonetheless failed to raise a genuine issue concerning the alleged burden-someness of the appointments.</p>\n<p id=\"b823-15\">I.</p>\n<p id=\"b823-16\">It is, of course, elementary that summary judgment should be granted only if there is no genuine issue as to any material fact and if the moving party is entitled to prevail as a matter of law. Fed.R.Civ.P. 56(c); <em>Thompson v. Evening Star Newspaper Co., </em>394 F.2d 774, 776-77 (D.C.Cir.), <em>cert. denied, </em>393 U.S. 884, 89 S.Ct. 194, 21 L.Ed.2d 160 (1968). When a party has properly pleaded and supported a motion for summary judgment under Rule 56(e), the opposing party must set forth specific facts showing that a genuine issue of material fact exists. See <em>Tarpley v. Greene, </em>684 F.2d 1, 6 (D.C.Cir. 1982); <em>Crooker v. Bureau of Alcohol, Tobacco &amp; Firearms, </em>670 F.2d 1051, 1054 n. 7 (D.C.Cir.1981). In addition to the requirements of Rule 56, the District Court\u2019s Local Rule l-9(h) requires the party opposing the motion to file a \u201cconcise statement of genuine issues\u201d setting forth all material facts <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"712\">*712</page-number>as to which it is contended there are genuine issues. Local Rule l-9(h) further provides that the court \u201cmay assume that the facts as claimed by the moving party in his statement .. . are admitted to exist except to the extent that they are controverted in a statement filed in opposition to the motion.\u201d This court has enforced this requirement stringently, stating that failure to file a proper Rule l-9(h) statement \u201cmay be fatal to the delinquent party\u2019s position.\u201d <em>Gardels v. CIA, </em>637 F.2d at 771, 773 (D.C. Cir.1980); <em>Tarpley v. Greene, </em>684 F.2d at 6-7 &amp; n. 15. <em>See also </em>10A C. Wright, A. Miller &amp; M. Kane, Federal Practice &amp; Procedure \u00a7 2719, at 12-13 (2d ed. 1983) (local rules requiring filing of statements of genuine issues are more demanding than Rule 56). It is within this undisputed procedural framework that this case, properly analyzed, should be decided.</p>\n<p id=\"b824-4\">A. <em>Thirteenth Amendment Claims</em></p>\n<p id=\"b824-5\">Appellants claim that the appointment system imposes involuntary servitude upon them in violation of the thirteenth amendment. They reason that because the bulk of their practice consists of compensated juvenile appointment cases, they are coerced into accepting the uncompensated neglect appointment cases in contravention of the thirteenth amendment.</p>\n<p id=\"b824-6\">As the majority correctly concludes, the uncontroverted facts of this case demonstrate that this claim is unmeritorious. First, appellants, by their own admission, are not <em>compelled </em>to place themselves on the list for compensated juvenile cases that subjects them to uncompensated neglect appointments. Involuntary servitude, in contrast, exists only when the individual is unable to avoid continued service. <em>See Flood v. Kuhn, </em>316 F.Supp. 271, 280-81 (S.D.N.Y.1970), <em>aff\u2019d, </em>443 F.2d 264, 268 (2d Cir.1971), <em>aff\u2019d on other grounds, </em>407 U.S. 258, 92 S.Ct. 2099, 32 L.Ed.2d 728 (1972); <em>Wicks v. Southern Pacific Co., </em>231 F.2d 130, 138 (9th Cir.1956). The attorneys here are free to stop practicing before the Family Division or to continue practicing without taking compensated juvenile cases. <em>See Flood v. Kuhn, </em>316 F.Supp. at 281. Second, compelling an individual to perform traditional types of public service does not constitute an imposition of involuntary servitude. <em>See Hurtado v. United States, </em>410 U.S. 578 n. 11, 93 S.Ct. 1157 n. 11, 35 L.Ed.2d 508 (1973) (requirement that prisoners serve as witnesses in trial without compensation constitutes public duty and does not constitute involuntary servitude); <em>cf. Powell v. Alabama, </em>287 U.S. 45, 73, 53 S.Ct. 55, 65, 77 L.Ed. 158 (1932) (attorneys are officers of the court and are duty bound to accept appointments to represent indigents charged with capital offenses). Thus, even if appellants were compelled to accept appointments, that service would not amount, under settled law, to involuntary servitude. <em>See Williamson v. Vardeman, </em>674 F.2d 1211, 1214 (8th Cir.1982) (thirteenth amendment has never been applied to various forms of public service and does not apply to uncompensated appointments an attorney may be required to take). To this extent, I fully agree with the majority opinion. As we move, however, from what I deem to be the patently frivolous thirteenth amendment claim to the due process and equal protection contentions, I am constrained to part company with the majority.</p>\n<p id=\"b824-9\">B. <em>\"Taking\u201d Claims</em></p>\n<p id=\"b824-10\">The district court held that appellants have suffered no \u201ctaking\u201d of their services without compensation in violation of the fifth amendment. Appellants\u2019 primary contention in this regard is that the uncompensated neglect appointments either have reached or could reach a level of burden-someness that would amount to a taking cognizable under the fifth amendment. They argue that the district court improperly granted summary judgment on this issue because their Rule l-9(h) statement set forth the number of uncompensated cases each individual attorney had been required to accept over the years, thus giving rise to a genuine issue of material fact on the issue of burdensomeness. Despite this argument, the district court properly granted summary judgment on this fifth amendment claim.</p>\n<p id=\"b825-3\"><page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"713\">*713</page-number>1. The Majority\u2019s Theory of \u201cTaking\u201d</p>\n<p id=\"A6G\">In my view, the burdensomeness of the uncompensated appointments is not material to determining whether a taking has occurred in this case. This case, unlike the cases relied upon by appellants and the authorities cited by the majority, does not involve conditioning the practice of law on the acceptance of uncompensated appointed cases. Indeed, a majority of the cases dealing with such requirements have squarely held that requiring counsel to serve without compensation <em>as a condition of being permitted to practice law </em>does not constitute a taking. <em>See, e.g., Williamson v. Vardeman, </em>674 F.2d 1211, 1214-15 (8th Cir.1982); <em>United States v. Dillon, </em>346 F.2d 633, 635 (9th Cir.1965), <em>cert. denied, </em>382 U.S. 978, 86 S.Ct. 550, 15 L.Ed.2d 469 (1966); <em>Jackson v. State, </em>413 P.2d 488, 489-90 (Alaska 1966); <em>MacKenzie v. Hillsborough County, </em>288 So.2d 200, 201 (Fla.1973); <em>Weiner v. Fulton County, </em>133 Ga.App. 343, 148 S.E.2d 143, 147 (Ga.), <em>cert. denied, </em>385 U.S. 958, 87 S.Ct. 393, 17 L.Ed.2d 304 (1966); <em>In re Meizlish, </em>387 Mich. 228, 196 N.W.2d 129, 134-35 (Mich.1972); <em>State v. Rush, </em>46 N.J. 399, 217 A.2d 441, 446 (N.J.1966).<footnotemark>3</footnotemark> These eases reason, correctly, that the uncompensated representation of individuals in need constitutes an attorney\u2019s duty as an officer of the court. <em>See Williamson v. Vardeman, supra, </em>674 F.2d at 1214 \u2014 15. Some courts have, to be sure, relaxed this absolute obligation, reasoning that although requiring an attorney to accept uncompensated cases as a condition of practicing law does not normally violate due process, the level of appointments may rise to the level of a taking when an attorney is substantially impaired in his ability to engage in remunerative practice. <em>See People ex rel. Conn v. Randolph, </em>35 Ill.2d 34, 219 N.E.2d 337, 341 (Ill.1966); <em>Bradshaw v. Ball, </em>487 S.W.2d 294, 295, 297-98 (Ct.App.Ky.1972); <em>State v. Green, </em>470 S.W.2d 571, 572-73 (Mo.1971) <em>(en banc); Honore v. Washington State Board of Prison Terms, </em>77 Wash.2d 660, 466 P.2d 485, 496-97 (1970) <em>(en banc); State ex rel. Partain v. Oakley, </em>227 S.E.2d 314, 318 (W.Va.1976).</p>\n<p id=\"b825-6\">Although appellants contend, and the majority now holds, that they should be permitted to prove that the Family Division appointments have risen to this level of burdensomeness, this analysis is, in my judgment, inapposite inasmuch as appellants, unlike the attorneys in all of the cases in which a taking has been found, have in no wise been drafted to perform such services. By accepting compensated juvenile cases, appellants agreed each and every month to accept uncompensated neglect cases as well. Only by their voluntarily seeking compensated cases were they then required to take on uncompensated cases. Moreover, appellants made no claim that they were required to continue uncompensated representations in the face of a request to withdraw. As a matter of law, I would conclude that no level of burden-someness could rise to the level of a taking as long as appellants have volunteered their services. In short, the element of voluntar-iness, which the majority fully concedes is present in this case, vitiates any fifth amendment claim of taking just as it does the even more far-fetched claim of involuntary servitude under the thirteenth amendment.</p>\n<p id=\"b825-7\">Although the majority concedes that \u201cproving a taking in a situation like this one is obviously a formidable task,\u201d its outline of the circumstances that would have to be shown in this case reveals that the appellants\u2019 task is not only formidable but impossible. The majority states that appellants would have to demonstrate, on remand, that the attorney\u2019s \u201cexpectations of pursuing a specialty practice before the Family Division are sufficiently established within the norms and traditions of legal practice to constitute a property interest.\u201d Majority Op. at 707. It would be easier for the proverbial camel to pass through the <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"714\">*714</page-number>eye of a needle than to satisfy this fanciful standard.</p>\n<p id=\"b826-4\">First, the notion that an attorney can have a property right in pursuing a <em>specialty </em>practice, as opposed to a property right in pursuing his <em>profession, </em>is completely without precedent. It should thus be emphatically clear that the majority has departed completely from the precincts of pri- or decisional law. <em>See supra </em>p. 713 (citing cases discussing attorneys\u2019 property right in pursuing profession). Second, even assuming that precedential support for the majority\u2019s notion exists, the majority fails to take into account the fact that the system involved here in no way prevents these attorneys from pursuing a specialty practice in the Family Division. To the contrary, only those attorneys who seek compensation from the public are even governed by the system at issue here. Finally, matters handled by the Family Division include not only child neglect and in-trafamily disputes, but also juvenile matters, domestic relations, and mental health matters. <em>See </em>1982 Annual Report of the District of Columbia Courts 68. The majority therefore considers far too narrow a proportion of the types of cases encompassed by Family Division practice in suggesting that the number of compensated cases may be \u201cso small that withdrawing from the market of government compensated cases would effectively be a decision to withdraw from practice before the Family Division.\u201d In sum, I do not believe there is any legal basis for the majority\u2019s theory that the District of Columbia is putting Family Division lawyers to a Hobson\u2019s choice of either not working or working under such a great burden as to amount to a taking.</p>\n<p id=\"b826-5\">More fundamentally, this court recently has repudiated the approach advocated by the majority in defining property under the taking clause of the fifth amendment. In <em>Kizas v. Webster, </em>707 F.2d 524 (D.C.Cir. 1983), this court rejected a claim by FBI employees that special preferences for a training program could give rise to a property right. <em>Id. </em>at 539-40. In that case, the plaintiffs attempted to analogize their interest in the benefits of the training program to a property interest such as that protected from deprivation without due process procedures. <em>Id. </em>at 538-39. Judge Bazelon, writing for the court, squarely rejected the notion that \u201ca claim of deprivation of property, without due process of law [can] be blended as one and the same with the claim that property has been <em>taken </em>for public use without just compensation.\u201d <em>Id. </em>at 539 (emphasis in original). Yet, the majority premises the possibility of appellants\u2019 taking claim on the same erroneous analogy by seeking to import Family Division attorneys\u2019 expectations of practicing before the Family Division into its analysis of property protected by the taking clause.</p>\n<p id=\"b826-7\">2. Standards for Granting Summary Judgment</p>\n<p id=\"b826-8\">But assuming <em>arguendo </em>that the burdensomeness analysis is apposite, appellants nonetheless failed to demonstrate the presence of a genuine issue of material fact. As the district court correctly stated, \u201c[n]othing in the record supports an allegation that \u2018great personal hardship and sacrifice has been imposed upon\u2019 Plaintiffs by their appointment to neglect cases.\u201d Memorandum Opinion at 7. Appellants failed to contest the appellees\u2019 statements in their Rule l-9(h) statement that neglect cases do not involve substantial research or investigation and that the burden imposed by such appointments neither impairs the attorneys\u2019 ability to engage in remunerative practice nor results in substantial out-of-pocket expenditures. Thus, under the well-established law of this circuit \u2014 which the majority does not question but chooses to ignore\u2014 the district court properly assumed the truth of those statements and, accordingly, granted summary judgment for the appellees. <em>See Tarpley v. Greene, </em>684 F.2d 1, 6-7 (D.C.Cir.1982); <em>Gardels v. CIA, </em>637 F.2d 770, 773 (D.C.Cir.1980). As this court stated in <em>Gardels, </em>the failure to challenge statements contained in a Rule 1\u20149(h) statement may be fatal to the delinquent party. 637 F.2d at 773. The majority, by reversing the district court\u2019s grant of summary judgment, <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"715\">*715</page-number>has failed to adhere to this court\u2019s admonishments that the requirements of Rule 1-9(h) be strictly enforced.</p>\n<p id=\"b827-4\">C. <em>Equal Protection Claims</em></p>\n<p id=\"A11\">Finally, the district court correctly granted summary judgment on appellants\u2019 claims that the appointment system violates the equal protection component of the fifth amendment.<footnotemark>4</footnotemark> Economic classifications such as those at issue here merit, under settled authority, only the mildest standard of review. <em>Craig </em>v. <em>Boren, </em>429 U.S. 190, 207, 97 S.Ct. 451, 462, 50 L.Ed.2d 397 (1976); <em>Dan-dridge v. Williams, </em>397 U.S. 471, 90 S.Ct. 1153, 25 L.Ed.2d 491 (1970). The classifications at issue here distinguish between lawyers who are compensated by public funds for Family Division appointments and those who are not; they also distinguish between those who are plainly and indisputably familiar with practice and procedure in the Family Division and those who are not. Each of these classifications bears a reasonable relation to legitimate governmental interests. <em>See United States Railroad Retirement Board v. Fritz, </em>449 U.S. 166, 174-75, 101 S.Ct. 453, 459-60, 66 L.Ed.2d 368 (1980); <em>Dandridge v. Williams, </em>397 U.S. 471, 483-86, 90 S.Ct. 1153, 1160-62, 25 L.Ed.2d 491 (1970). The District of Columbia clearly has a legitimate interest in providing counsel to indigent parents in child neglect cases. A classification resulting in the selection of attorneys familiar with Family Division practice and who have voluntarily sought compensated appointments by placing their names on the Family Division\u2019s list each month is an entirely rational means of furthering this interest. In sum, on the undisputed facts of this case, appellants have not made out an equal protection violation.<footnotemark>5</footnotemark></p>\n<p id=\"b827-7\">II.</p>\n<p id=\"b827-8\">There is undoubtedly genuine wisdom in much of the majority\u2019s expressions of concern and reservation about the Family Division appointments system at issue in this case. The appointments system may indeed be one crying out for reform, as the majority goes to some lengths to suggest in the latter part of its opinion. It is perhaps unenlightened and unsound public policy to perpetuate a system which results in cases arguably being given short shrift, as stated by the District of Columbia Bar Report on which the majority relies. But whatever discomfort on our part may reasonably attend the continuation of a system which treats such highly sensitive and important issues of family relations, that discomfort does not warrant a strained solicitousness for bizarre constitutional claims advanced by self-interested lawyers who could promptly opt out of the system they decry.</p>\n<p id=\"b827-9\">Our mission is not, under the guise of entertaining constitutionally based claims for attorneys\u2019 fees, to constitute ourselves as a Council on Judicial Reform. It is, in my judgment, cases such as this, where a request for reform comes clothed in constitutional garb, that to an unfortunate degree render the increasing workload of the federal judiciary a proximate result of the judiciary\u2019s own imaginative handiwork.</p>\n<p id=\"b827-10\">I respectfully dissent.</p>\n<footnote label=\"1\">\n<p id=\"b823-11\">. The district court also concluded that the fact that the court appoints counsel for some nonin-digent parents did not affect this result. Memorandum Opinion at 5-6. The court reasoned that the superior court\u2019s Neglect Rule 20(b) and D.C.Code \u00a7 16-2326 (1981) provide avenues of relief for attorneys that are appointed to represent parents that the court later determines are not indigent. <em>Id.</em></p>\n</footnote>\n<footnote label=\"2\">\n<p id=\"b823-12\">. 1 agree fully with the majority that the District Court properly refused, under the specific circumstances of this case, to abstain from deciding the federal constitutional issue. Unlike <em>Younger v. Harris, </em>401 U.S. 37, 91 S.Ct. 746, 27 L.Ed.2d 669 (1971), and its civil progeny, in this case there was no pending proceeding in the District of Columbia courts. Moreover, as the majority correctly observes, any remedial order would not, as in <em>O\u2019Shea v. Lit-tleton, </em>414 U.S. 488, 94 S.Ct. 669, 38 L.Ed.2d 674 (1974), impinge upon the day-to-day operations of the superior court.</p>\n</footnote>\n<footnote label=\"3\">\n<p id=\"b825-4\">. In a minority of jurisdictions, requiring an attorney to accept uncompensated appointments as a condition of granting a license to practice law has been considered a taking. <em>See, e.g., State v. Bell, </em>244 Ind. 701, 195 N.E.2d 464, 466 (1964); <em>Bedford v. Salt Lake County, 22 </em>Utah 2d 12, 447 P.2d 193, 195 (1968).</p>\n</footnote>\n<footnote label=\"4\">\n<p id=\"b827-5\">. Equal protection concepts, as the majority correctly notes, are inherent in the fifth amendment\u2019s due process guarantee. <em>See Weinberger v. Wiesenfeld, </em>420 U.S. 636, 638 n. 2, 95 S.Ct. 1225, 1228 n. 2, 43 L.Ed.2d 514 (1975); <em>Bolling v. Sharpe, </em>347 U.S. 497, 74 S.Ct. 693, 98 L.Ed. 884 (1954); <em>Washington v. United States, </em>401 F.2d 915, 922 (D.C.Cir.1968). Equal protection analysis under the fifth amendment follows that under the fourteenth amendment. <em>Buckley v. Valeo, </em>424 U.S. 1, 93, 96 S.Ct. 612, 670, 46 L.Ed.2d 659 (1976).</p>\n</footnote>\n<footnote label=\"5\">\n<p id=\"b827-12\">. Appellants also claim that the district court erred in not finding an equal protection violation because the system discriminates between attorneys who are appointed to represent children and those who are appointed to represent parents in that only attorneys who are appointed to represent children receive compensation. Appellants\u2019 Brief at 19. As appellants concede, however, the existence of such a disparity was not brought to the district court\u2019s attention and thus may not properly be considered by this court.</p>\n</footnote>\n</opinion>\n</casebody>\n",
