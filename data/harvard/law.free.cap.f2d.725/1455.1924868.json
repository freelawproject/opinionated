SKELLY WRIGHT, Circuit Judge:</author>\n<p id=\"b1561-11\">In this Freedom of Information Act (FOIA) case appellant \u2014 a federal prisoner-sought relief in the District Court for the refusal of the United States Parole Commission to release three documents to him: his presentence report, a few lines excised from a letter written by a probation officer to the Commission, and a psychological report written about him. The District Court granted the Commission\u2019s motion for summary judgment and dismissed appellant\u2019s suit. In this opinion we reverse the District Court with respect to the presentence report and the psychological report, and affirm the District Court\u2019s holding that the Commission did not have to release the material excised from the letter.</p>\n<p id=\"b1561-13\">I. Factual Background</p>\n<p id=\"A28\">On October 5, 1981 appellant made a FOIA request to the Parole Commission for a number of documents about himself in the possession of the Commission. After some delays \u2014 allegedly due to the large number of pending requests \u2014 the Commission released some of the documents to appellant on December 18, 1981, and then released additional documents on April 21, 1982. The Commission withheld all or part of three documents:</p>\n<p id=\"b1561-14\">(1) A presentence report originally prepared in 1977 by a probation officer for the District Court for the Eastern District of Virginia (hereinafter referred to as the \u201cVirginia District Court\u201d). The Commission withheld the entire report on the ground that it was a court document rather than an agency record, and that it therefore was not subject to FOIA. <em>See </em>5 U.S.C. \u00a7 552(a)(3) &amp; (4)(B) (1982) (providing that agencies make \u201cagency records\u201d available to the public and granting District Courts authority to order production of \u201cagency records improperly withheld\u201d).</p>\n<p id=\"b1561-15\">(2) Portions of a letter (the \u201cBenoit letter\u201d) from Probation Officer Thyra Benoit to a Parole Commission employee, dated March 3, 1981. The Commission alleges that disclosure of the excised portions of the letter would reveal the identity of a confidential source, and those portions are therefore privileged under Exemptions 7(C) and (D) of FOIA. <em>See </em>5 U.S.C. \u00a7 552(b)(7)(C) &amp; (D) (1982).<footnotemark>1</footnotemark></p>\n<p id=\"b1561-16\">(3) A \u201cpsychological test screening report\u201d (hereinafter referred to as the \u201cpsychological report\u201d), dated December 29, 1977, and prepared by the Bureau of Prisons staff. This report was withheld in its entirety under FOIA Exemptions 5 and 7(C), 5 U.S.C. \u00a7 552(b)(5) &amp; (7)(C) (1982),<footnotemark>2</footnotemark> <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"1458\">*1458</page-number>on the ground that its disclosure would be potentially disruptive to appellant's response to institutional programs.</p>\n<p id=\"b1562-4\">Meanwhile, as the Commission was processing appellant\u2019s request, appellant filed a FOIA complaint in the District Court for the District of Columbia (hereinafter referred to as \u201cD.C. District Court\u201d) on January 11, 1982. On February 22, 1982 he moved for summary judgment, and the government filed a cross-motion for summary judgment on May 17, 1982. The government accompanied its motion with affidavits of Linda Marble, Chief Case Analyst for the National Appeals Board of the Parole Commission (hereinafter the \u201cpublic Marble affidavit\u201d), and Billy Torrans, Chief Probation Officer for the Virginia District Court (hereinafter the \u201cTorrans affidavit\u201d). The D.C. District Court held a hearing on September 23 (in appellant\u2019s absence because appellant was incarcerated and litigating his FOIA case <em>pro </em>se), at which the court requested a supplemental affidavit concerning the Benoit letter and the psychological report. On October 8 the government submitted a second affidavit of Linda Marble (hereinafter the <em>\u201cin camera </em>Marble affidavit\u201d), along with complete copies of the Benoit letter and the psychological report.</p>\n<p id=\"b1562-5\">On October 27, 1982 the D.C. District Court entered a memorandum opinion and order granting the government\u2019s motion for summary judgment. The court held that the presentence report was an agency record and thus subject to FOIA. However, the court held that, because the Virginia District Court \u201cconsiders presentence reports confidential court documents which it loans to the Parole Commission only to enable the Commission to carry out its statutory function,\u201d Memorandum Opinion in D.D.C.Civil Action No. 82-241 (October 25, 1982) (Dist.Ct.Op.) at 4, Joint Appendix (JA) 79, the Parole Commission had not \u201cimproperly\u201d withheld it within the meaning of 5 U.S.C. \u00a7 552(a)(4)(B) (1982) (granting District Courts authority to order release of \u201cagency records improperly withheld\u201d). The court also held that, based in part on the information in the <em>in camera </em>Marble affidavit, the Benoit letter portions were exempt from FOIA for the reasons urged by the government. Finally, the court held that, based again in part on the <em>in camera </em>Marble affidavit, the psychological report also came within the FOIA exemptions urged by the government. Appellant here challenges all of these holdings.<footnotemark>3</footnotemark></p>\n<p id=\"b1562-11\">II. The Presentence Report</p>\n<p id=\"AQmV\">In <em>Carson v. U.S. Dep\u2019t of Justice, </em>631 F.2d 1008 (D.C.Cir.1980), this court held that a presentence report is an agency record for purposes of FOIA. In this case the Parole Commission ignores the rationale underlying our <em>Carson </em>decision and once again advances the argument we rejected in <em>Carson; </em>appellees\u2019 argument reduces to the assertion that, because presentence reports originate in the courts (which are not \u201cagencies\u201d under FOIA), the originating court may under current law continue to control the report after it has been turned over to the Parole Commission. Under the principles developed in <em>Goland v. CIA, </em>607 F.2d 339 (D.C.Cir.1978), <em>vacated in part on other grounds, </em>607 F.2d 367 (D.C.Cir.1979), <em>cert. denied, </em>445 U.S. 927, 100 S.Ct. 1312, 63 L.Ed.2d 759 (1980), such control would be sufficient to make the report <em>a </em>\u201ccourt record,\u201d rather than an \u201cagency record,\u201d and thus outside the scope of FOIA. Furthermore, appellees and the D.C. District Court seem to believe that the Virginia District Court\u2019s assertions of control over the presentence report, if not sufficient to deny the report the status of agency record, should nonetheless be sufficient to make the Parole Commission\u2019s withholding of the report not \u201cimproper.\u201d The result of this line of reasoning would be the same as the result we rejected in <em>Carson: </em>the presentence report would be beyond the scope of FOIA.</p>\n<p id=\"b1563-3\"><page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"1459\">*1459</page-number>We here reaffirm our decision in <em>Carson: </em>a presentence report in the hands of the Parole Commission under current law is an agency record for purposes of FOIA. We once again reject the arguments we rejected in <em>Carson </em>and we also decline to entertain these arguments under the guise of a discussion of what is an \u201cimproper\u201d withholding. We believe that our <em>Carson </em>decision was clear enough on these points. However, if any doubts remain, we hope that our discussion here finally settles the status of presentence reports under FOIA.</p>\n<p id=\"b1563-4\">A. <em>Agency Records</em></p>\n<p id=\"b1563-5\">In <em>Goland v. CIA, supra, </em>this court grappled with the problem of what constitutes an \u201cagency record\u201d for purposes of FOIA. In <em>Goland </em>the CIA had refused to release records concerning the legislative history of the CIA\u2019s organic statutes. This court affirmed the refusal on the ground that the document sought (a transcript of a secret House of Representatives hearing) was a congressional document rather than an agency record. The <em>Goland </em>court stated that the appropriate test to determine whether a public document was an agency record was \u201cwhether under all the facts of the case the document has passed from the control of Congress and become property subject to the free disposition of the agency with which the document resides.\u201d 607 F.2d at 347.</p>\n<p id=\"b1563-6\"><em>Carson </em>applied the <em>Goland </em>test to presen-tence reports. The 10th Circuit, in <em>Cook v. Willingham, </em>400 F.2d 885 (10th Cir.1968) <em>(per </em>curiam), had held with little discussion that presentence reports are not agency records, on the ground that such reports were prepared by courts, which are not</p>\n<p id=\"b1563-8\">\u201cagencies\u201d for purposes of FOIA. <em>See </em>5 U.S.C. \u00a7 551(1)(B) (1982). The <em>Carson </em>court neither approved nor disapproved the <em>Cook </em>result, but held that the law concerning the use of presentence reports had changed substantially in two ways since the time of <em>Cook. </em>First, Rule 32(c) of the Federal Rules of Criminal Procedure required sentencing courts to disclose much of the contents of presentence reports to requesting defendants before imposing sentence. This provision had been added in 1975, and had \u201csubstantially dilute[d] the sentencing court\u2019s control over the presentence report.\u201d <em>Carson, supra, </em>631 F.2d at 1012. Second\u2014 and more importantly \u2014 Congress had recently given the Parole Commission important responsibilities with respect to pre-sentence reports. The Parole Commission and Reorganization Act, Pub.L. 94-233, 90 Stat. 219, had required the Parole Commission to use presentence reports in making parole determinations, see 18 U.S.C. \u00a7 4207 (1982), and had required courts to transmit the reports to the Parole Commission for these purposes, <em>see id. </em>\u00a7 4205(e). The statute had also required the Parole Commission to grant requesting prisoners \u201creasonable access\u201d to presentence reports in most cases. <em>See id. </em>\u00a7 4208(b). Because the pre-sentence reports thus had come to serve an important function in the Commission\u2019s de-cisionmaking process, the <em>Carson </em>court concluded that the Commission exercised considerable control over the reports. Therefore, under <em>Goland, </em>the reports were as a matter of law to be considered agency records.<footnotemark>4</footnotemark></p>\n<p id=\"b1563-10\">It is important to emphasize the scope of the <em>Carson </em>holding. Nowhere in <em>Carson </em>is there so much as a hint that the history of <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"1460\">*1460</page-number>the particular presentence report in question had any bearing on the court\u2019s decision. Rather, the <em>Carson </em>court held that the law, as well as the usage, concerning presen-tence reports gave the Parole Commission considerable control over them.<footnotemark>5</footnotemark> Under <em>Go-land, </em>of course, the existence of this control made the documents into agency records subject to FOIA.</p>\n<p id=\"b1564-4\">Appellees here argue that an originating entity may so restrict use of a presentence report it sends to an agency covered by FOIA that the document remains under the control of the originating agency and never becomes an agency record. In this case the Torrans affidavit claims that it is the Virginia District Court\u2019s \u201cpolicy\u201d that \u201c[a]ll Presentences are deemed to be loaned to the Parole Commission and Bureau of Prisons to enable them to carry out their official functions, and should be returned to the [Virginia District] Court after such use, or upon request. Disclosure of Presentence Reports has been authorized only so far as to comply with 18 U.S.C. [\u00a7] 4208(b)(2).\u201d <em>JA </em>61. According to appellees, the Virginia District Court's assertion of this policy enabled it to retain control over the presen-tence report when it transferred the report to the Parole Commission.</p>\n<p id=\"b1564-5\">In the face of <em>Carson, </em>we find appellees\u2019 argument to be without merit. Given the functions that presentence reports serve in accord with actual usage and congressional enactment, the Virginia District Court\u2019s assertions of control were irrelevant for purposes of determining whether the presentence report was an agency record. As we held in <em>Carson, </em>the fact is that the Virginia District Court \u2014 whatever its policy may be \u2014 does not and cannot control presentence reports after it has turned them over to the Parole Commission.</p>\n<p id=\"b1564-6\">B. <em>Improperly Withheld</em></p>\n<p id=\"AH6\">The D.C. District Court relied on <em>GTE Sylvania, Inc. v. Consumers Union, </em>445 U.S. 375, 100 S.Ct. 1194, 63 L.Ed.2d 467 (1980), to hold that, although the presentence report was an agency record, it had not been \u201cimproperly\u201d withheld. <em>See </em>Dist.Ct.Op. at 4, JA 79. In <em>GTE Sylvania </em>a Delaware District Court had issued an injunction forbidding the Consumer Products Safety Commission (CPSC) from releasing certain documents to the public. After the injunction was issued, Consumers Union filed a suit in D.C. District Court seeking release of the documents under FOIA. CPSC\u2019s defense in that suit was that it had not <em>improperly </em>withheld the documents, because its withholding was merely in obedience to the Delaware court order. The Supreme Court agreed with CPSC that the agency\u2019s withholding of the documents was not improper; since such \u201cimpropriety\u201d is a prerequisite for a court to order release of documents under FOIA, see <em>Kissinger v. Reporters Committee for Freedom of the Press, </em>445 U.S. 136, 150, 100 S.Ct. 960, 968, 63 L.Ed.2d 267 (1980), the Supreme Court held that the D.C. District Court could not grant such relief.</p>\n<p id=\"b1564-9\">According to the D.C. District Court, the Virginia District Court\u2019s \u201cpolicy\u201d forbidding the Parole Commission to release presentence reports is analogous to the injunction that was issued by the Delaware District Court in <em>GTE Sylvania. </em>However, the reasoning of <em>GTE Sylvania </em>in fact undermines the D.C. District Court\u2019s holding. As the Supreme Court noted, <em>GTE Sylvania </em>was an application of the \u201cestablished doctrine that persons subject to an injunctive order issued by a court with jurisdiction are expected to obey that decree until it is modified or reversed, even if they have proper grounds to object to the order.\u201d 445 U.S. at 386,100 S.Ct. at 1201. The rationale of that decision, as elucidated in such well-known cases as <em>United States v. United Mine Workers, </em>330 U.S. 258, 67 S.Ct. 677, 91 L.Ed. 884 (1947), and <em>Walker v. City of Birmingham, </em>388 U.S. 307, 314-321, 87 S.Ct. 1824, 1828-1832, 18 L.Ed.2d 1210 (1967), is that those who object to a court order are expected to <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"1461\">*1461</page-number>make their objection by means of the rules and procedures in accord with which the judicial system operates, for a court\u2019s ability to command adherence to its procedures and to resolve disputes depends on its ability to compel obedience to orders properly issued. Those rules and procedures provide a fair opportunity to object to or appeal mistaken rulings, and even interested individuals who are not parties to the proceedings have the opportunity to intervene under the modern Federal Rules of Civil Procedure. <em>See, e.g., </em>Fed.R.Civ.P. 24.</p>\n<p id=\"b1565-5\">In this case, however, there were no formal judicial proceedings, no opportunity for Mr. Lykins to object to the court\u2019s \u201cpolicy,\u201d no chance for intervention, and no concrete case or controversy before the Virginia District Court.<footnotemark>6</footnotemark> In these circumstances \u2014 very different from <em>GTE Sylvania\u2019s </em>formal injunction issued after a proceeding to which Consumers Union could easily have become a party \u2014 the Virginia District Court\u2019s \u201cpolicy\u201d deserves no greater deference than the expressed desires of any other governmental body. To the extent that the Parole Commission has control of the presentence report \u2014 as we held in <em>Carson </em>\u2014 the \u201cpolicies\u201d of the Virginia District Court do not override appellant\u2019s right under FOIA to see the report. Whatever may be the power of the Virginia District Court to order its own business on the basis of \u201cpolicies\u201d of this character, that court cannot by articulating its desires on its own motion determine the rights of third parties not before it and over whom it has no jurisdiction.</p>\n<p id=\"b1565-9\">The consequence of accepting the D.C. District Court\u2019s understanding of <em>GTE Syl-vania </em>would be once again to let in through the back door the arguments we rejected in <em>Carson. </em>The Virginia District Court\u2019s \u201cpolicy\u201d is relevant, if at all, only to the question whether it has retained control of the pre-sentence report and thus prevented it from becoming an agency record subject to FOIA. As we discussed above, in <em>Carson </em>we answered that question by holding that a District Court cannot so retain control. The inquiry into whether a document is \u201cimproperly\u201d withheld is a very different inquiry, directed .not at the desires of the originating agency (whether it be a court, Congress, or other governmental body not covered by FOIA), but at the question whether a court of competent jurisdiction over the subject matter and over the parties has issued a valid injunction.<footnotemark>7</footnotemark> Considera<page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"1462\">*1462</page-number>tions relevant to the application of the <em>Go-land </em>control test would rarely, if ever, be relevant to the latter inquiry into the jurisdiction of a court. We refuse to transform the latter inquiry into an opportunity for the parties to re-litigate issues of control over documents that should be properly resolved in terms of the <em>Goland </em>control test for agency records.</p>\n<p id=\"b1566-4\">III. The Benoit Letter and the Psychological Report</p>\n<p id=\"AHjS\">The trial court held that the excised portion of the Benoit letter was properly withheld under Exemptions 7(C) and 7(D) of FOIA, 5 U.S.C. \u00a7 552(b)(7)(C) &amp; (D) (1982), and that the psychological report was properly withheld under Exemptions 5 and 7(C), 5 U.S.C. \u00a7 552(b)(5) &amp; (7)(C) (1982). The District Court found these exemptions applicable in part on the basis of information contained in the <em>in camera </em>Marble affidavit. <em>See </em>Dist.Ct.Op. at 2-3, JA 77-78. Appellant does not seem to challenge the Commission\u2019s right to withhold information to protect the identities of confidential sources in general under Exemptions 7(C) and 7(D). Appellant argues instead that the court committed error (1) in relying upon <em>in camera </em>affidavits, (2) in failing to require more detailed and particularized public information from the agency about the contents of the materials withheld and the possible seg-regability of privileged parts from nonprivi-leged parts, and (3) in failing to explicate more specifically the findings necessary to demonstrate that the claimed exemptions are applicable. The Benoit letter and the psychological report merit somewhat different analyses, and in what follows we affirm the District Court\u2019s holding with respect to the Benoit letter and reverse with respect to the psychological report.</p>\n<p id=\"b1566-8\">A. <em>The Benoit Letter</em></p>\n<p id=\"afv-dedup-1\">The public Marble affidavit stated that \u201c[fjive sentences and a reference to a source were excised from a letter from U.S. Probation Officer Thyra R.J. Benoit to Michael J. Santella, Case Analyst of the Northeast Region, dated March 3, 1981. The purpose was to protect a confidential source of information which would become known through disclosure of the person\u2019s identity or the information supplied.\u201d JA 48. The remainder of the letter was released. For the reasons that follow, we hold that this information \u2014 coupled with the District Court\u2019s <em>in camera </em>inspection of the deleted portions of the letter \u2014 was sufficient to justify the excisions.</p>\n<p id=\"b1566-9\">The seminal case of <em>Vaughn v. Rosen, </em>484 F.2d 820 (D.C.Cir.1973), <em>cert. denied, </em>415 U.S. 977, 94 S.Ct. 1564, 39 L.Ed.2d 873 (1974), established that the government must supply to a FOIA requester any reasonably segregable, nonexempt portions of documents that are in part exempt from FOIA\u2019s disclosure requirements. <em>Id. </em>at 825-827; <em>see also Yeager v. DEA, </em>678 F.2d 315, 322 &amp; n. 16 (D.C.Cir.1982) (discussing meaning of term \u201creasonably segregable\u201d); 5 U.S.C. \u00a7 552(b) (1982) (\u201cAny reasonably segregable portion of a record shall be provided to any person requesting such record <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"1463\">*1463</page-number>after deletion of the portions which are exempt under this subsection.\u201d). The government then bears the burden of justifying nondisclosure of any withheld documents or portions of documents, <em>see Yeager, </em>678 F.2d at 320; <em>Jordan v. U.S. Dep\u2019t of Justice, </em>591 F.2d 753, 779 (D.C.Cir.1978) (en <em>banc); </em>5 U.S.C. \u00a7 552(a)(4)(B) (1982). The government must supply the requester with detailed indexes itemizing each item withheld, the exemptions claimed for that item, and the reasons why the exemption applies to that item. <em>Vaughn, </em>484 F.2d at 827-828. To the extent necessary, the government must supply affidavits in support of its claims of exemption.</p>\n<p id=\"b1567-5\">This detailed procedure serves at least three purposes: it forces the government to analyze carefully any material withheld, it enables the trial court to fulfill its duty of ruling on the applicability of the exemption, and it enables the adversary system to operate by giving the requester as much information as possible, on the basis of which he can present his case to the trial court. Because this last purpose can only be served if the detailed indexes and justifications are available to the requester, we have required that as much information as possible be made public. However, in cases in which a look at the withheld material itself would be useful, we have fully approved <em>in camera </em>examination of the withheld material by the trial court. <em>See Phillippi </em>v. <em>CIA, </em>546 F.2d 1009, 1012-1013 (D.C.Cir.1976) (\u201cIt is clear that the FOIA contemplates that the courts will resolve fundamental issues in contested cases on the basis of <em>in camera </em>examinations of the relevant documents.\u201d); <em>Allen </em>v. <em>CIA, </em>636 F.2d 1287, 1294-1300 (D.C.Cir.1980) (discussing the utility of <em>in camera </em>review of withheld material). Of course, such <em>in camera </em>examination is not a substitute for the government\u2019s obligation to provide detailed public indexes and justifications whenever possible. Rather, it will in most cases assist the District Court as a supplement to the detailed public record and adversary testing of the government\u2019s justifications for withholding information.</p>\n<p id=\"b1567-6\">t5] These principles are sufficient to dispose of the Benoit letter. The Parole Commission released virtually the entire contents of appellant\u2019s file (including over 138 documents). In addition, the Commission segregated the exempt portions of the Be-noit letter (approximately five sentences) from the nonexempt portions of the letter (approximately 12 sentences). Although the Commission did not formally prepare a <em>Vaughn </em>index to the letter, the public Marble affidavit in fact provided all of the information that such an index would have disclosed: the amount of material excised, the exemptions claimed for the material, and the justification supporting the application of the exemptions to the material. The District Court properly examined <em>in camera </em>the entire Benoit letter, which was affixed to the <em>in camera </em>Marble affidavit. The District Court concluded that release of the five additional sentences would have compromised a legitimately confidential source, and therefore ruled that Exemptions 7(C) and 7(D) applied. We hold that the District Court followed a reasonable procedure with respect to the Benoit letter, and we have no reason to believe that it reached an incorrect result.</p>\n<p id=\"b1567-8\">Appellant seems to object to the somewhat conclusory nature of the justification offered in the public Marble affidavit, and would therefore have us remand this issue to the District Court with instructions that the government should be required to make public further information about the deleted portions of the Benoit letter. To be sure, one of the square holdings of <em>Vaughn </em>was that the government may not justify withholding information in FOIA cases on the basis of sweeping or conclusory statements concerning the applicability of FOIA exemptions. But we do not believe that appellant can demonstrate on the facts of this case that the government\u2019s justification was improper under <em>Vaughn.</em></p>\n<p id=\"b1567-9\">This court has recognized that there are occasions when extensive public justification would threaten to reveal the very information for which a FOIA exemption is claimed. <em>See, e.g., Hayden v. NSA, </em>608 F.2d 1381, 1384-1385 (D.C.Cir.1979), <em>cert. denied, </em>446 U.S. 937, 100 S.Ct. 2156, 64 L.Ed.2d 790 (1980). Particularly in cases in <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"1464\">*1464</page-number>which the identity of a confidential source under Exemption 7(D) is at issue, the government may be unable to divulge more information publicly without giving away the information it is trying to withhold. In this kind of case, in which an agency has released most of the contents of a document and has otherwise met its FOIA obligations in good faith, a public statement that the remaining small portions would reveal a confidential source \u2014 coupled with <em>in camera </em>review of the excised portions of the document by the trial court, <em>see Allen v. CIA, supra, </em>636 F.2d at 1298 (\u201cSufficiently detailed justifications [in public affidavits] for the agency\u2019s withholding is often impossible * * * because such justifications would reveal the very information sought to be protected.\u201d) \u2014 is sufficient to meet <em>Vaughn\u2019s </em>requirements. We hold that this principle governs the Benoit letter, and affirm the District Court on this basis.<footnotemark>8</footnotemark></p>\n<p id=\"b1568-4\">Our holding in this case should not be construed to grant approval to agencies and trial courts to ignore <em>Vaughn\u2019s </em>standards and to justify nondisclosure by means of general and conclusory statements; we remain fully committed to the procedures specified in <em>Vaughn. </em>However, when an agency has disclosed a great deal of a document and withholds only a few lines that would reveal the identity of a confidential source, and when the trial court\u2019s <em>in camera </em>review confirms that such a confidential source would be revealed, the kind of justification proffered in the public Marble affidavit does not violate <em>Vaughn\u2019s </em>strictures against overly sweeping and conclusory invocation of FOIA exemptions. <em>Cf. Lesar v. U.S. Dep\u2019t of Justice, </em>636 F.2d 472, 492 (D.C.Cir.1980). In short, we do not here make an exception to <em>Vaughn\u2019s </em>requirements; rather, we hold that those requirements were met in this case.</p>\n<p id=\"b1568-9\">B. <em>The Psychological Report</em></p>\n<p id=\"b1568-10\">The psychological report raises more serious problems. The entire document was withheld from appellant, who thus has had little opportunity to discover even the kinds of material contained in the document. Moreover, the public Marble affidavit states only that \u201c[a] psychological test screening report dated December 29, 1977, prepared by Bureau of Prison\u2019s [sic] Staff, was denied as it contains diagnostic material and conclusions of a psychological or psychiatric nature which, if known to Mr. Lykins, would be potentially disruptive to his response to institutional programs.\u201d The affidavit does not discuss the question of what parts of the report might be segrega-ble and therefore subject to disclosure, nor does it relate particular parts of the report to particular FOIA exemptions, nor does it reveal any significant information about the length of the report or the circumstances surrounding its production.<footnotemark>9</footnotemark> Therefore, the public affidavit is clearly insufficient as a <em>Vaughn </em>index.<footnotemark>10</footnotemark></p>\n<p id=\"b1569-3\"><page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"1465\">*1465</page-number>The legitimacy of accepting <em>in camera </em>affidavits (as opposed to <em>in camera </em>review of withheld documents) has troubled this court in the past. Although <em>in camera </em>review of withheld documents is permissible (and even encouraged), we have held that a trial court should not use <em>in camera </em>affidavits unless necessary and, if such affidavits are used, it should be certain to make the public record as complete as possible. <em>See Arieff v. Dep\u2019t of Navy, </em>712 F.2d 1462, 1470-1471 (D.C.Cir.1988); <em>Campbell v. Dep\u2019t of HHS, </em>682 F.2d 256, 265 (D.C.Cir. 1982); <em>Yeager v. DEA, supra, </em>678 F.2d at 324-325; <em>Allen v. CIA, supra, </em>636 F.2d at 1298 n. 63; <em>Ray v. Turner, </em>587 F.2d 1187, 1211 n. 43 (D.C.Cir.1978) (Wright, J., concurring in the remand); <em>Phillippi v. CIA, supra, </em>546 F.2d at 1013. We have permitted such <em>in camera </em>affidavits in national security cases, <em>see Hayden </em>v. <em>NS A, supra, </em>608 F.2d at 1384, and have stated that the use of such affidavits is at the discretion of the trial court, <em>Campbell, supra, </em>682 F.2d at 260. As appellees contend, we have never limited the use of <em>in camera </em>affidavits to national security cases, but we have expressed reservations about such use in cases which do not involve national security. <em>See Campbell, supra, </em>682 F.2d at 265; <em>Yeager, supra, </em>678 F.2d at 324-325; <em>Allen, supra, </em>636 F.2d at 1298 n. 63 (procedures \u201cshould be employed only where absolutely necessary\u201d); <em>Ray, supra, </em>587 F.2d at 1211 n. 43 (\u201cprocedure must be reserved for unusual and especially sensitive circumstances\u201d). When a trial court does make use of <em>in camera </em>affidavits, it must see to it that such use is justified to the greatest extent possible on the public record, <em>see Yeager, supra, </em>678 F.2d at 325; <em>Phillippi, supra, </em>546 F.2d at 1013,<footnotemark>11</footnotemark> and must then make available to the adverse party as much as possible of the <em>in camera </em>submission, <em>see Hayden, supra, </em>608 F.2d at 1388.</p>\n<p id=\"b1569-7\">The above standards concerning the use of <em>in camera </em>affidavits arise from the judicial system\u2019s interest in an effective adversary system. In <em>Vaughn </em>we emphasized the crucial importance of providing as much information as possible to FOIA plaintiffs, so that the adversary system can function effectively in assisting the trial court to make a determination and producing a record that is susceptible to appellate review. <em>See Vaughn, supra, </em>484 F.2d at 823-826; <em>accord Yeager, supra, </em>678 F.2d at 324; <em>Phillippi, supra, </em>546 F.2d at 1013. Even in cases in which we have permitted <em>in camera </em>affidavits, we have noted that they are only permissible if \u201cthe interests of the adversary process are outweighed\u201d by other crucial interests. <em>Hayden, supra, </em>608 F.2d at 1385.</p>\n<p id=\"b1569-8\">In this case the District Court\u2019s failure to hold the government to the accepted standards for submission of <em>in camera </em>affidavits made it impossible for the adversary system to function effectively in the District Court. The record does not show any effort by the court or the government to supply appellant with a <em>Vaughn </em>index; appellant was given no information concerning which exemptions were claimed for the report, the circumstances surrounding the report\u2019s creation, the length of the report, the possibility of segregating exempt portions from nonexempt portions, or the identity of the author of the report. <em>Cf. Pollard v. FBI, </em>705 F.2d 1151, 1155 (9th Cir.1983) <em>(in camera </em>affidavit accepted in case in which public affidavit had provided \u201cdetailed description of the withheld document\u201d). In short, appellant had rio oppor<page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"1466\">*1466</page-number>tunity to challenge the government\u2019s claim of exemption. Furthermore, there was no finding (and no basis in the record for a finding) that the government had a crucial interest in secrecy in this case that outweighed the importance of an effectively functioning adversary system and that would therefore justify circumvention of that system in this case. We therefore hold that the proper predicates for acceptance of <em>in camera </em>affidavits were not met in this case, and the District Court should not have relied upon the <em>in camera </em>Marble affidavit in reaching its decision.<footnotemark>12</footnotemark></p>\n<p id=\"b1570-4\">IV. Conclusion</p>\n<p id=\"b1570-5\">Because we here reverse the District Court\u2019s holding that the presentence report was not an agency record, we remand this case to the District Court. In filings with the District Court the government does not seem to have asserted that any particular FOIA exemptions would apply to all or part of the presentence report. The District Court should therefore consider carefully whether any new government claims of exemption are permissible under <em>Ryan v. Dep\u2019t of Justice, </em>617 F.2d 781, 791-792 (D.C. Cir.1980), <em>Jordan </em>v. <em>U.S. Dep\u2019t of Justice, supra, </em>591 F.2d at 779-781, and <em>Carson v. U.S. Dep\u2019t of Justice, supra, </em>631 F.2d at 1015 n. 29. We also reverse the District Court\u2019s holding that the psychological report was exempt under FOIA. Our decision is based entirely on the District Court's failure to require an adequate public record with respect to this report, and we express no opinion as to whether some portions of the report may be exempt. However, on remand the District Court should require the agency to comply with the ordinary standards in FOIA cases, including release of any reasonably segregable portions of the report and preparation of an index relating any withheld portions to specific FOIA exemptions. Finally, we affirm the District Court\u2019s holding that the excised portions of the Benoit letter were exempt from release.</p>\n<p id=\"b1570-7\">\n<em>Affirmed in part and reversed and remanded in part.</em>\n</p>\n<footnote label=\"1\">\n<p id=\"b1561-12\">. Insofar as is relevant here, these provisions state that FOIA does not apply to \u201cinvestigatory records compiled for law enforcement purposes, but only to the extent that the production of such records would * * * (C) constitute an unwarranted invasion of personal privacy, [or] (D) disclose the identity of a confidential source and, in the case of a record compiled by a criminal law enforcement authority in the course of a criminal investigation, * * * confidential information furnished only by the confidential source * *</p>\n</footnote>\n<footnote label=\"2\">\n<p id=\"b1561-18\">. Section 552(b)(5) excludes from FOIA \u201cinter-agency or intra-agency memorandums or letters which would not be available by law to a party other than an agency in litigation with the agency[.].\u201d The relevant portions of \u00a7 552(b)(7)(C) are quoted in note 1 <em>supra.</em></p>\n</footnote>\n<footnote label=\"3\">\n<p id=\"b1562-6\">. The District Court also rejected allegations in appellant\u2019s complaint that he was entitled to some of the materials pursuant to the Privacy Act of 1974, 5 U.S.C. \u00a7 552a (1982). Because appellant does not raise any Privacy Act issues in his brief or argument on appeal, the District Court\u2019s decisions on these issues are not before this court.</p>\n</footnote>\n<footnote label=\"4\">\n<p id=\"b1563-7\">. The government argues that, contrary to the conclusion of the <em>Carson </em>court, the language of Rule 32(c) in fact militates against the conclusion reached there \u2014 that a presentence report is an agency record. The government points out that the amended language of Rule 32(c) requires that a judge disclose to a defendant much of the presentence report before imposing sentence, but still requires return of all copies of the report \u201cunless the court, in its discretion!,] otherwise permits.\u201d The government argues that to hold the report discoverable under FOIA would render meaningless the sentencing court\u2019s ability to forbid the defendant to retain a copy of the report after sentencing. Brief for appellees at 9 n. 3. The <em>Carson </em>court, in reaching its result, necessarily disposed of this argument. But we note that, even under our holding today, the court\u2019s discretion to require return of part or all of the report is far from a nullity. For, even if the report is an agency record, it is not <em>thereby </em>discoverable; the possibility remains, as <em>Carson </em>recognized, that all or part of the report may remain confidential under FOIA\u2019s exemptions.</p>\n</footnote>\n<footnote label=\"5\">\n<p id=\"b1564-7\">. It is true that <em>Goland </em>had referred to \u201call the facts of the case\u201d in formulating the control test. <em>See 607 </em>F.2d at 347. By using this language, the court evidently intended to point out that no particular indicia of control will be dispositive in every case. It would be a mistake to read this language to foreclose the possibility that law and usage make certain types of documents agency records, regardless of minor factual variations in particular cases.</p>\n</footnote>\n<footnote label=\"6\">\n<p id=\"b1565-6\">. In fact, outsiders evidently had no way of knowing of the supposed \u201cpolicy\u201d until some time in March of 1981 (long after Lykins\u2019 report had been transmitted to the Parole Commission) when the Virginia District Court began stamping presentence reports released to other agencies with a rubber stamp stating its \u201cpolicy\u201d of confidentiality. Torrans affidavit, JA 61. Given our holdings in this case, it is clear that the presence or absence of the rubber stamp on Lykins\u2019 own presentence report is irrelevant. In accord with our <em>Carson </em>holding re-affirmed here, the rubber stamp would have failed to keep the report from becoming an agency record. However, the very secrecy of the Virginia District Court\u2019s \u201cpolicy\u201d illustrates one reason why that \u201cpolicy\u201d is not entitled to the kind of undeviating obedience the Supreme Court ordered in <em>Mine Workers </em>and <em>Walker.</em></p>\n</footnote>\n<footnote label=\"7\">\n<p id=\"b1565-7\">. In a post-argument submission the government has informed us that the \u201cpolicy\u201d of the Virginia District Court is now enshrined in an \u201corder\u201d dated December 9, 1983. The issuance of this order does not affect our analysis or our conclusion that the presentence report is being improperly withheld. The Virginia District Court\u2019s \u201corder\u201d was not an injunction of the kind at issue in <em>GTE Sylvania, </em>because it was not issued as a part of a concrete case or controversy before the court. And if the Virginia District Court had no jurisdiction to issue an injunction binding the Parole Commission, the \u201corder\u201d therefore cannot be of the kind that would make the Commission\u2019s withholding of the report \u201cproper\u201d under <em>GTE Sylvania.</em></p>\n<p id=\"b1565-11\"><em>United Mine Workers </em>lends no support to the claim that the \u201corder\u201d here was a valid injunction deserving of the unyielding obedience that the Supreme Court required in that case. For the principle of <em>United Mine Workers </em>is not that any pronouncement of a court \u2014 regardless whether the court has subject matter jurisdiction or whether there is an Article III case or controversy \u2014 must be absolutely followed upon penalty of a contempt citation. Rather, the case stands for the more modest proposition that a court has inherent jurisdiction to determine its own jurisdiction in a case, and that an order it issues while it makes this determination is binding. <em>See </em>330 U.S. at 290, 292-293, 67 S.Ct. at 694, 695. There is no indication that the Virginia District Court\u2019s order had anything to do with any concrete case or controversy before it, and <em>United Mine Workers </em>therefore cloaks it with no additional dignity. Of course, as we state in text, we are not here questioning the ability of the Virginia <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"1462\">*1462</page-number>District Court to issue housekeeping \u201corders\u201d of this type to organize its own business. Rather, we are holding that an \u201corder\u201d of this type does not have the legal effect of the injunctions in <em>GTE Sylvania </em>or <em>United Mine Workers.</em></p>\n<p id=\"b1566-6\">We note that the result we reach here is supported by significant policy considerations. If the Virginia District Court\u2019s \u201corder\u201d were treated as a full-scale injunction, then Mr. Ly-kins may be denied his statutory right of action, for it is very unclear how a plaintiff like Lykins could challenge that order as unjustified; although a petition for intervention comes to mind, there is no ongoing proceeding in which he could intervene. Moreover, even if there were a mechanism by which a FOIA plaintiff like Lykins could appear before the court to challenge the \u201corder,\u201d the effect would be to permit the Virginia District Court to force FOIA plaintiffs seeking presentence reports originating in that district to bring their FOIA complaints there. But Congress explicitly laid venue in FOIA cases in \u201cthe district in which the complainant resides, or has his principal place of business, or in which the agency records are situated, or in the District of Columbia.\u201d 5 U.S.C. \u00a7 552(a)(4)(B) (1982). Thus the plaintiff would be denied his right to venue in accord with the express statutory intention. At any rate, there is no reason why the Virginia District Court \u2014 which has its own interests in the report at stake \u2014 should be a preferred forum to hear this case.</p>\n</footnote>\n<footnote label=\"8\">\n<p id=\"b1568-5\">. If the public Marble affidavit is sufficient under <em>Vaughn </em>standards, then the trial court\u2019s own somewhat conclusory findings that release would endanger a confidential source are similarly appropriate: further justification of such a small excision in this context would itself endanger the source.</p>\n</footnote>\n<footnote label=\"9\">\n<p id=\"b1568-6\">. The affidavit goes on to state that \u201cMr. Ly-kins is presently an inmate in the Arlington County Detention Center. The Commission\u2019s regulations at 28 C.F.R. \u00a7 2.56(c)(1) protects [sic] diagnostic material, and staff members in preparing such reports do so under a promise of confidentiality per 28 C.F.R. \u00a7 2.56(c)(2). The document is stamped \u2018FOI EXEMPT\u2019 meaning that the Bureau of Prisons would deny it to a requester under the Freedom of Information Act as an inter-agency memorandum containing work product of the professional staff and containing opinions and conclusions.\u201d JA 49. This is all of the information in the public record concerning the psychological report.</p>\n</footnote>\n<footnote label=\"10\">\n<p id=\"b1568-12\">. The government suggests that the public record is sufficient to justify withholding the entire psychological report under Exemptions 5 and 7(C), because \u201cCommission regulations at 28 C.F.R. \u00a7 2.56(c)(l)-(3) (1981) permit withholding of diagnostic material and material obtained under a promise of confidentiality, and * * * staff members prepare such diagnostic material under such a promise.\u201d Brief for ap-pellees at 16. So far as we are able to tell from the record in this case, appellant first learned that the government was claiming Exemption 5 when the government filed its motion for summary judgment and first learned that the government was claiming Exemption 7(C) when he read the District Court\u2019s opinion in this case. As we point out below, it is the function of a <em>Vaughn </em>index in part to notify a FOIA plaintiff of the exemption being claimed, <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"1465\">*1465</page-number>so that he can litigate the issues involved in that exemption.</p>\n</footnote>\n<footnote label=\"11\">\n<p id=\"b1569-5\">. Even in circumstances in which the use of an in camera affidavit has been fully justified, the District Court still would retain the obligation to see to it that materials withheld under FOIA exemptions genuinely qualify for those exemptions. In this case, for instance, the name of the author of the psychological report appears to be a segregable part of the report. After an examination of the <em>in camera </em>affidavit and the report itself, we are unable to find any legitimate justification for withholding the name of the author. However, because we remand to the District Court for further proceedings with respect to this report, and because the issue of whether exemptions were properly claimed with respect to the psychological report was never litigated, <em>see </em>note 10 <em>supra, </em>we do not pass on whether any given portions of the report should be released to appellant.</p>\n</footnote>\n<footnote label=\"12\">\n<p id=\"b1570-6\">. Because the public Marble affidavit was sufficient to meet <em>Vaughn\u2019s </em>standards with respect to the Benoit letter, the District Court did not have to rely on the <em>in camera </em>Marble affidavit in ruling on the Benoit letter, and the trial court\u2019s apparent reliance would be at worst harmless error. <em>Cf. Salisbury v. United States, 690 </em>F.2d 966, 973 n. 3 (D.C.Cir.1982).</p>\n</footnote>\n</opinion>\n<opinion data-order=\"11\" data-type=\"opinion\" id=\"x999-2\" type=\"concurring-in-part-and-dissenting-in-part\">\n<author id=\"b1570-8\">HARRY T. EDWARDS, Circuit Judge,</author>\n<p id=\"AG3\">dissenting in part and concurring in part:</p>\n<p id=\"b1570-9\">I dissent with respect to the majority\u2019s treatment of the psychological report. In analyzing this case under the Freedom of Information Act, I find absolutely no material distinction between the psychological report and the Benoit letter. The majority cites no significant differences between these two documents and, yet, affirms as to one but not the other. I would affirm as to both documents.</p>\n<p id=\"b1570-10\">The record in this matter clearly indicates that Lykins did not receive a list of claimed Freedom of Information Act exemptions as to either the psychological report or the Benoit letter. It is equally plain, however, that the contents of the public Marble affidavit adequately informed Lykins of the nature of the claimed FOIA exemptions, thus enabling him to litigate any issues raised by either document. Therefore, to the extent that the public affidavit was deficient at all, it was equally deficient as to both documents. Nonetheless, because Lykins had adequate notice of the Government\u2019s proposed exemptions for both documents, and because, in any event, I can find no basis whatsoever for disclosure of the psychological report, I dissent from the decision to remand. The Government\u2019s failure in this case to adhere to the strict technical requirements of a <em>Vaughn </em>Index was at worst harmless error. In my view, to remand under these circumstances is merely to engage in empty formality and to require an already overburdened District Court to do the same.</p>\n</opinion>\n</casebody>\n",
