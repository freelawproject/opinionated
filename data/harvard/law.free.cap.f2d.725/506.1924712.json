We affirm.</p>\n<p id=\"b620-5\">I. <em>Facts</em></p>\n<p id=\"b620-6\">On June 26, 1978, a barge and tug owned by Bohemia collided with a small boat on the Umpqua River in Oregon. Albert Balkema and his wife were fishing from the boat, and Albert drowned in the accident. His wife allegedly suffered personal injuries. Bohemia was covered by two insurance policies \u2014 a primary policy issued by Home and an excess policy by Employer\u2019s. Home immediately retained a Portland law firm to investigate the accident, and the firm assigned Clemens E. Ady to the case. Balkema\u2019s estate brought a $1 million dollar wrongful death action in state court against Bohemia. Home considered its policy limit to be $100,000 and, through Ady, offered $20,000 prior to trial and $50,000 on the first day of trial to settle the case. The estate\u2019s attorney proposed a settlement for $100,000, but the district court found that the estate at no time made a definite offer to settle within the policy limit. The case went to trial, and the jury awarded $250,-000, reduced to $175,000 by Balkema\u2019s 30% contributory negligence. Home paid $100,-000 less defense costs, and Employer\u2019s paid the balance including $5,000 to settle all potential claims by Mrs. Balkema personally-</p>\n<p id=\"b620-7\">II. <em>Proceedings in District Court</em></p>\n<p id=\"b620-8\">Bohemia and Employer\u2019s then brought an admiralty action against Home in federal district court under 28 U.S.C. \u00a7 1333 alleging that (1) Home\u2019s policy limit was $200,000; (2) Home owed Employer\u2019s and Bohemia the same duty of good faith and due care in its evaluation and settlement of the Balkema claims; and (3) Home breached its duty by (a) negligently evaluating the claims, (b) failing to inform Employer\u2019s of settlement progress, (c) failing to settle the claims within the primary policy limits, and (d) failing to recognize and settle Mrs. Balkema\u2019s personal claims.</p>\n<p id=\"b620-10\">The district court granted partial summary judgment on the policy limit issue, holding that the limit was $100,000. The court tried the remaining issues without a jury. In detailed findings of fact and conclusions of law the court determined that: (1) \u201cHome owed a good faith duty to Employer\u2019s to consider Employer\u2019s interests while evaluating its settlement decisions, and a duty to balance those interests as if Home were liable for any excess judgment . .. \u201d; (2) while Ady misjudged the settlement value of the case, neither he nor Home was negligent or acted in bad faith during their evaluation of the claims and the settlement negotiations; (3) Home owed no duty to keep Employer\u2019s informed of the progress of the ease after initially notifying Employer\u2019s of the claims, absent requests from Employer\u2019s for information; and (4) Home\u2019s failure to settle Mrs. Balkema\u2019s claim before trial caused Employer\u2019s no \u2022 damage.</p>\n<p id=\"b620-11\">Employer's and Bohemia contend on appeal that each of the foregoing findings was clearly erroneous. In its cross-appeal, Home contends (1) that Bohemia and Employer\u2019s breached a duty to participate in the evaluation and defense of the claims, and (2) that Bohemia was not injured by Home\u2019s alleged negligent conduct and therefore could not subrogate a claim on which. Employer\u2019s could sue.</p>\n<p id=\"b620-12\">III. <em>Standard of Review</em></p>\n<p id=\"b620-13\">With respect to the summary judgment on the policy limit issue, we conduct de novo review, viewing the evidence in the light most favorable to the losing party, to determine if the prevailing party was clearly entitled to judgment as a matter of law. <em>Roberts v. Elaine Powers Figure Salons, Inc., </em>708 F.2d 1476, 1478 (9 Cir.1983).</p>\n<p id=\"b620-14\">With respect to the remaining issues, in reviewing the findings of the district court we are \u201cbound by the \u2018clearly erroneous\u2019 standard of Rule 52(a), Federal Rules of <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"509\">*509</page-number>Civil Procedure.\u201d <em>Inwood Laboratories v. Ives Laboratories, </em>456 U.S. 844, 855, 102 S.Ct. 2182, 2188,72 L.Ed.2d 606 (1982). Unless we are \u201cleft with the \u2018definite and firm condition that a mistake has been committed,\u2019 <em>United States v. United States Gypsum Co., </em>333 U.S. 364, 395, 68 S.Ct. 525, 542, 92 L.Ed. 746 (1948), [we] must accept the trial court\u2019s findings.\u201d <em>Id.</em></p>\n<p id=\"b621-6\">IV. <em>Primary Policy Limit</em></p>\n<p id=\"b621-7\">The policy separately named and insured each of Bohemia\u2019s vessels for liability up to $100,000. The policy limited coverage \u201cin respect to any one accident or occurrence ... to the <em>amount </em>hereby insured,\u201d which, Employer\u2019s contends, equals $200,000 since two vessels were involved \u2014 the barge and the tug. (emphasis added). As Home points out, however, Bohemia\u2019s underlying liability arises from its ownership of the negligent tugboat \u2014 not from ownership of the barge. Similarly, the policy specifically indemnified Bohemia for damages that it \u201cshall as owners of the vessel named herein have become liable to pay... . \u201d From these provisions, Home contends, and the district court held, that policy coverage is limited to the tugboat ($100,000) since ownership of the tug is the sole source of Bohemia\u2019s liability.<footnotemark>1</footnotemark></p>\n<p id=\"b621-8\">In concluding that the coverage was limited to $100,000 insurance on the tug, the district court relied primarily on <em>St. Paul Fire &amp; Marine Insurance v. Vest Transportation Co., </em>500 F.Supp. 1365, 1372-77 (N.D. Miss.1980), <em>aff\u2019d per curiam, </em>666 F.2d 932 (5 Cir.1982). In <em>Vest </em>a barge being towed by a tug collided with a bridge and sank. The question arose whether the insurance policy covering the barge and tug would pay the cost of removing the sunken barge. The critical language of the policy was identical to the provisions now before us. The court held that the policy indemnified the vessel owner only for liability arising from his ownership of the insured vessel. Since liability arose solely from ownership of the tug, the policy did not cover removal of the sunken barge. The court supported its conclusion with an exhaustive review of the federal case law which, we conclude, sufficiently establishes a federal admiralty rule governing the policy provisions at issue here.</p>\n<p id=\"b621-12\">Employer\u2019s and Bohemia contend that the court erred in applying federal admiralty law rather than state law for interpreting insurance policies. They argue that <em>Wilburn Boat Co. v. Fireman\u2019s Fund Insurance Co., </em>348 U.S. 310, 75 S.Ct. 368, 99 L.Ed. 337 (1955) requires this court to apply state rules for construing contracts in the absence of a controlling federal rule.<footnotemark>2</footnotemark></p>\n<p id=\"b621-13\">In <em>Kalmbach, Inc. v. Insurance Co. of Pennsylvania, </em>529 F.2d 552, 554-55 (9 Cir. 1976), we observed that \u201c[w]hether federal or local law applies to a maritime insurance contract can present a troublesome question.\u201d There we applied state law \u201cbecause both parties urge us to do so and because there is no statutory or judicially established federal admiralty rule governing the provisions in question.\u201d <em>Id. </em>Similarly, when we considered an equal protection' attack on a state statute affecting marine indemnity policies, we noted that \u201cthis matter is not substantively governed by a federal admiralty rule, and that state law therefore applies to the regulation of marine insurance indemnity contracts.\u201d <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"510\">*510</page-number><em>Ahmed v. American Steamship Mutual Projection &amp; Indemnity Assoc., </em>640 F.2d 993, 996 (9 Cir.1981) (dictum), <em>cert. </em>denied, \u2014U.S. \u2014, 104 S.Ct. 98, 78 L.Ed.2d 103 (1983).<footnotemark>3</footnotemark> Our decisions rely on <em>Wilburn Boat Co., supra, </em>348 U.S. at 313-14, 75 S.Ct. at 370, and <em>Kossick v. United Fruit Co., </em>365 U.S. 731, 741-42, 81 S.Ct. 886, 893-94, 6 L.Ed.2d 56 (1961) which, when read together, hold that state law will control the interpretation of a marine insurance policy only in the absence of a federal statute, a judicially fashioned admiralty rule, or a need for uniformity in admiralty practice. As noted above, we conclude that a federal admiralty rule governs the policy provisions at issue here. We therefore affirm the district court\u2019s summary judgment setting the policy limit at $100,000.</p>\n<p id=\"a-k-dedup-0\">V. <em>Negligence in Evaluating and Processing Claim</em></p>\n<p id=\"b622-8\">The district court found that neither Home nor its attorney was negligent in \u201cevaluating, handling, and processing\u201d the Balkema claim. We conclude that this finding is not clearly erroneous and is supported by substantial evidence.</p>\n<p id=\"b622-9\">Employer\u2019s and Bohemia rely on <em>Portland Electric Co. v. Pacific Indemnity Co., </em>574 F.2d 469, 474 (9 Cir.1978) and <em>Rova Farms Resort v. Investors Ins. Co. of Amer., </em>323 A.2d 495, 65 N.J. 474 (1974) in support of their contentions that the district court erred in its findings that Home \u2018did not act negligently or in bad faith. In <em>Portland Electric </em>we mentioned as factors which should be considered during the evaluation of a claim: (1) potential for a plaintiff\u2019s verdict exceeding primary coverage; (2) elements and extent of loss; (3) jury appeal of parties, witnesses, and the case; and (4) local verdict history. 574 F.2d at 474.</p>\n<p id=\"b622-10\">After receiving expert testimony at trial, the district court found \u201cthe reasonable settlement value of this case was between $75,000 and $125,000.\u201d Ady, Home\u2019s attorney, evaluated the case at $20,000, but the court held that \u201cto misjudge the settlement value of a claim\u201d is not negligence. \u201cWhen an attorney had diligently gathered all necessary information,\u201d the court reasoned, \u201cand has made a good faith pretrial evaluation of the settlement value of that claim, he cannot be deemed negligent simply because that evaluation is wrong.\u201d Accord, <em>North River Insurance Co. v. St. Paul Fire &amp; Marine Insurance Co., </em>600 F.2d 721, 724 (8 Cir.1979) (interpreting South Dakota law).</p>\n<p id=\"b622-13\">We find substantial evidence in the record to support the district court\u2019s finding that Ady \u201cpromptly and diligently investigated and evaluated the claim, and at all times handled the litigation in a competent and professional manner.\u201d It is also clear that Ady considered all the factors set out in <em>Portland General Electric, supra. </em>On June 26, 1978, the day of the accident, Ady investigated the accident site and on July 7 sent a six page report to Home, including photographs of the site. The report expressed Ady\u2019s belief that Home risked \u201csubstantial exposure in this case\u201d based on the following conclusions drawn from his investigation: (1) the skipper of the tug \u201cwas negligent in failing to post a lookout on the bow of the barge, especially where the channel is so close to the shore and around a blind corner\u201d; (2) the skipper not only was \u201cnegligent for failing to climb the [elevated navigation] platform,\u201d but in fact was relieving himself over the side when the accident occurred; (3) Bohemia was also \u201cnegligent in failing to provide adequate controls on the elevated platform ... (4) the skipper \u201cmakes a rather poor appearance as a witness but is rather articulate. .. . \u201d Ady also concluded, however, that the Balkemas were contributorily negligent for being on the river without life jackets, anchored in a commercial channel frequented by tugs and barges, and obscured by a bend in the river. Ady also reported interviewing a witness to <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"511\">*511</page-number>the accident who was sympathetic to the Bohemia. Ady finally advised Home to set up a reserve of $45,000 to $50,000.</p>\n<p id=\"b623-5\">Ady issued a second report on March 30, 1979, after most of the depositions were completed. He assessed the witnesses\u2019 appeal and reviewed the facts, concluding that negligence would \u201cprobably be weighted against Bohemia ... in that they are a large company and are obviously target defendants.\u201d Ady also noted that damages were particularly difficult to predict because lost support was minimal, and damages consisted almost solely of love and affection lost to Balkema\u2019s five adult children. \u201cIt is not unlikely,\u201d Ady reported, \u201cthat we could obtain a settlement in the area of $30,000. However, it is our opinion that the likelihood of receiving an extremely large verdict is not there.\u201d Ady recommended settlement \u201cin the neighborhood of $20,000.\u201d</p>\n<p id=\"b623-6\">The parties agree that the district court misread part of Ady\u2019s March 30 report. In the report, Ady stated that federal maritime law and its \u201cpure\u201d comparative negligence provisions would apply to the case, thus assuring the estate of a recovery regardless of the contributory negligence assigned to Balkema. The district court erroneously found, however, that Ady suggested \u201csettlement in the area of $20,000 would probably be reasonable because under Oregon law if the Balkema\u2019s were more than 50% negligent they could recover nothing.\u201d</p>\n<p id=\"b623-7\">While the parties agree that this finding is clearly erroneous, they disagree on the effect the error had on the district court\u2019s finding that neither Ady nor Home negligently evaluated the case. Employer\u2019s speculates that the court considered Ady\u2019s evaluation of the case non-negligent because it erroneously believed a defense verdict was possible. We need not speculate with Employer\u2019s since we may affirm the district court on the basis of any record evidence that supports its judgment. <em>Southwestern Publishing Co. v. Simons, </em>651 F.2d 653, 656 n. 2 (9 Cir.), <em>cert. denied, </em>455 U.S. 1018, 102 S.Ct. 1714, 72 L.Ed.2d 136 (1981). The evidence we have reviewed amply supports the court\u2019s finding, notwithstanding its misreading of Ady\u2019s report,<footnotemark>4</footnotemark> that Ady \u201cpromptly and diligently investigated and evaluated the claim.... \u201d</p>\n<p id=\"b623-11\">The court also found that insurers often \u201cmust place substantial reliance on local counsel\u201d in evaluating a case,<footnotemark>5</footnotemark> and that Home, having retained competent counsel, was entitled to rely on his non-negligent evaluation. We agree. Furthermore, while Ady diligently gathered and reported all the necessary information to Home, it is also clear, as the district court found, that \u201cHome responded to the information it received in a prompt and diligent manner, and it actively sought periodic reports.\u201d There is no evidence here of negligence arising from the insurer\u2019s \u201cbureaucratic bungling and assembly-line inefficiency.\u201d <em>Cf. Robertson v. Hartford Accident &amp; Indemnity Co., </em>333 F.Supp. 739, 742 (D.Or. 1970); <em>O\u2019Keefe v. Safeco Insurance Co., </em>55 Or.App. 811, 639 P.2d 1312, 1314-15 (1982). The district court\u2019s finding that Home was not negligent was not clearly erroneous.</p>\n<p id=\"b623-12\">VI. <em>Good Faith in Evaluating and Failure to Settle the Claim</em></p>\n<p id=\"b623-13\">It is well settled in Oregon that the insurer owes its insured a duty to exercise good faith in evaluating and settling a <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"512\">*512</page-number>claim. <em>Portland General Electric, supra, </em>574 F.2d at 473; <em>Eastham v. Oregon Auto Insurance Co., </em>273 Or. 600, 540 P.2d 364, 367, <em>reh\u2019g denied, </em>273 Or. 610, 542 P.2d 895 (1975); <em>Radcliffe v. Franklin National Insurance Co., </em>208 Or. 1, 298 P.2d 1002, 1020 (1956); <em>Kriz v. Government Employees Insurance Co., </em>42 Or.App. 339, 600 P.2d 496, 500 (1979). We held in <em>Portland General Electric, supra, </em>574 F.2d at 473, that the excess insurer also has a \u201cright to have [the primary insurer] act in good faith.\u201d See also <em>Maine Bonding &amp; Casualty Co. </em>v. <em>Centennial Insurance Co., </em>64 Or.App. 97, 667 P.2d 548 (1983) (court assumed but expressly refused to decide that primary insurer owed good faith duty to excess insurer). We later explained the origin of the excess insurer\u2019s \u201cright\u201d in <em>Portland General Electric, Co., v. Pacific Indemnity Co., </em>579 F.2d 514, 516 (9 Cir.1978):</p>\n<blockquote id=\"b624-4\">We think that the Oregon court would follow the Minnesota court [in <em>Continental Casualty Co. v. Reserve Insurance Co., </em>307 Minn. 5, 238 N.W.2d 862 (1979) ] and our interpretation of California law [in <em>Valentine v. Aetna Insurance Co., </em>564 F.2d 292, 296-98 (9 Cir.1977) ] and hold that [the excess insurer] was subrogated to all of PGE\u2019s rights if PGE had not had an excess carrier.</blockquote>\n<p id=\"b624-5\">(citing <em>Groce v. Fidelity General Insurance Co., </em>252 Or. 296, 298, 448 P.2d 554, 557 (1968)). Since the Oregon court still has not faced this question, we continue to follow the foregoing reasoning and hold that Employer\u2019s acquired by equitable subrogation whatever rights Bohemia might have had against Home for breach of its duty of good faith.</p>\n<p id=\"b624-6\">The district court held that Home owed a good faith duty \u201cto consider Employer\u2019s interests while evaluating its settlement decisions, and a duty to balance those interests as if Home were liable for any excess judgment over the policy limit.\u201d This is an accurate statement of the good faith duty as applied in Oregon. See <em>Eastham v. Oregon Auto Insurance Co., supra, </em>273 Or. 600, 540 P.2d at 367.<footnotemark>6</footnotemark> In concluding that Home did not breach its duty, the district court relied on four specific findings: (1) \u201cat no time did the estate actually present Home with a definite offer to settle within the policy limit\u201d; (2) even if Home had offered its policy limit, it was not clear the estate would have accepted; (3) \u201cHome\u2019s possible gain by not settling was not grossly disproportionately small compared to the risk to the excess insurer\u201d; and (4) Home\u2019s reliance on the advice of its counsel was evidence of good faith. Employer\u2019s attacks these findings as clearly erroneous and additionally contends that Home failed to consider Employer\u2019s interests in the settlement negotiations.</p>\n<p id=\"b624-9\">The district court correctly noted that a firm settlement offer \u201cis not a prerequisite to recovery in every case\u201d but is an important factor in determining whether the insurer refused in bad faith to settle a claim within its policy limits. Compare <em>Baton </em>v. <em>Transamerica Insurance Co., </em>584 F.2d 907, 913 (9 Cir.1978), with <em>Maine Bonding &amp; Casualty Co. v. Centennial Insurance Co., supra, </em>64 Or.App. at 101-02, 667 P.2d at 550-51. The court considered conflicting testimony on this point: Ady repeatedly reported receiving an \u201coffer\u201d to settle for $100,000; but testimony at trial suggested that the offers were not firm proposals but merely the attorneys\u2019 opinions on what amount might settle the case. The testimony of the estate\u2019s attorney also supports the court\u2019s uncertainty over whether the estate would have accepted the policy limit had it been offered. The attorney felt \u201cquite certain\u201d that such an offer would have been accepted, but he added that his opinion was at best \u201can educated guess\u201d and that the estate\u2019s personal representative, the decedent\u2019s son, \u201cfrankly wanted to go to trial.\u201d<footnotemark>7</footnotemark> <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"513\">*513</page-number>Given the conflicting evidence, the district court\u2019s finding is not clearly erroneous.</p>\n<p id=\"b625-4\">The third finding derives from a test set out in <em>Eastham, supra, </em>540 P.2d at 367: \u201cBad faith is normally demonstrated by proving that the risks of unfavorable results were out of proportion to the chances of a favorable outcome.\u201d Here the court found that the possibility of a favorable result \u201cwas not grossly disproportionately small compared to the risk to the excess insurer.\u201d Although the district court perhaps framed the test too leniently, the record sufficiently supports a finding that the relative risks were not \u201cout of proportion\u201d. Having established a reserve of $50,-000, Home offered $20,000 and reasonably relied on its counsel\u2019s opinion that a verdict exceeding the policy limit was highly unlikely. The evidence indicates that Home reasonably believed the risk to Employer\u2019s was minimal.<footnotemark>8</footnotemark> The facts of this case are distinguishable from those in <em>Portland General Electric, supra, </em>where the primary insurer clearly perceived but ignored the almost certain risks to the excess insurer.</p>\n<p id=\"b625-5\">The court also found that Home\u2019s reliance on Ady\u2019s advice was evidence of good faith. We agree that when an insurer reasonably relies on a diligent, good faith evaluation by its counsel, the court may treat such reliance as evidence of the insurer\u2019s good faith.</p>\n<p id=\"b625-6\">Finally, Employer\u2019s contends that Home failed to consider the interests of the insured and excess insurer by refusing to offer its policy limit and \u201csacrifice its own interest in favor of its insured.\u201d The Oregon court in <em>Eastham, supra, </em>273 Or. at 608, 540 P.2d at 368, recognized that:</p>\n<blockquote id=\"AVLj\">an insurer <em>may be </em>found to have acted in bad faith in failing to make or in unduly delaying an offer or counteroffer to settle. Also, when there is clear liability it <em>may be </em>bad faith for the insurer to refuse to settle.</blockquote>\n<p id=\"b625-10\">(emphasis in original)</p>\n<p id=\"b625-11\">In <em>Eastham </em>the policy limit was $25,000. The insurer\u2019s attorney evaluated the claim at $6,000 or $7,000 and testified that the maximum verdict which could reasonably be expected was $15,000. Plaintiff\u2019s attorney evaluated the claim at $12,000 to $14,-000. Neither party ever made a formal offer to settle except for plaintiff\u2019s offer to settle for the policy limit of $25,000. Plaintiff contended that the insurer was guilty of bad faith in failing to make a counteroffer to the demand for the policy limit. The jury awarded $50,000. Finding insufficient evidence to submit the question of bad faith to a jury, the <em>Eastham </em>court held that \u201cthe company was justified in electing to try the case rather than making the gesture of extending a counteroffer.\u201d <em>Id.</em></p>\n<p id=\"b625-12\">While plaintiff\u2019s modest evaluation of his own case distinguishes <em>Eastham </em>from the facts in this case, we are still left with a case where the parties were widely divided based on their good faith evaluations of the claim. As the <em>Eastham </em>court observed, the parties \u201csometimes reach a figure which is considered mutually advantageous. If so, the case is settled; if not, it is tried.\u201d <em>Id. </em>So here, having found that Home conducted a non-negligent, good faith evaluation of its case, the district court was justified in finding that Home did not breach its duty of good faith in failing to settle prior to trial.</p>\n<p id=\"b625-13\">VII. <em>Duty to Inform Excess Insurer</em></p>\n<p id=\"b625-14\">The district court found (1) that Home notified Employer\u2019s that the Balkema claim might affect their excess policy and (2) that such notice was all \u201cHome was required to provide Employer\u2019s absent further requests for information by Employer\u2019s.\u201d The court <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"514\">*514</page-number>further concluded as a matter of law that \u201cHome was under no duty to keep Employer\u2019s informed of the progress of the litigation .. . after Home initially informed Employer\u2019s of the existence of the litigation, absent any requests by Employer\u2019s for such information.\u201d Employer\u2019s contends that the district court\u2019s statement of law is wrong and based on clearly erroneous findings. We disagree.</p>\n<p id=\"b626-4\">Home communicated at least three times with Employer\u2019s prior to trial, each time through its agent, Gene Sause &amp; Co., who was also Employer\u2019s broker. In September of 1978 Sause sent Employer\u2019s a complete copy of the file, notifying Employer\u2019s that the claim might involve its excess policy; Sause updated the file in January of 1979; finally, while negotiating renewal of Bohemia\u2019s excess policy, Sause suggested that the claim would probably be settled within Home\u2019s policy limits.<footnotemark>9</footnotemark> Employer\u2019s at no time prior to trial requested information nor was Employer\u2019s ever denied information. The parties apparently agree, however, that Home, through Ady and Sause, kept Bohemia adequately informed of the progress of the litigation.</p>\n<p id=\"b626-5\">It is undisputed that Employer\u2019s was entitled to notice of the claim against its insured Bohemia. Its policy specifically required that Bohemia, \u201cupon knowledge of any occurrence likely to give rise to a claim hereunder, shall give immediate written notice thereof to the Company.\u201d Employer\u2019s received such notice and more. Appellants contend, however, that in addition to notice of the accident and claim, Home owed an independent duty to Employer\u2019s to keep Employer\u2019s advised as to the progress of the case, settlement negotiations, and trial date.<footnotemark>10</footnotemark> We reject this contention for two reasons. First, as against Home we have decided that Employer\u2019s acquired whatever rights Bohemia had and nothing more. Home owed a clear duty to inform Bohemia of significant developments in the case. See <em>Radcliffe v. Franklin National Insurance Co., supra, </em>208 Or. 1, 298 P.2d at 1024; <em>Young </em>v. <em>American Casualty Co., </em>416 F.2d 906, 910 (2 Cir.1969), (applying New York law) <em>cert, dismissed sub nom. Myles v. Procurer, </em>396 U.S. 997, 90 S.Ct. 580, 24 L.Ed.2d 490 (1970). Home did not breach its duty to Bohemia, and Employer\u2019s therefore has no claim against Home for failure to inform Bohemia. Second, the considerations requiring Home to inform its insured do not require equal treatment of the excess insurer. The insured is generally ignorant of insurance practices and legal procedure; he has a contract with the insurer under which he usually relinquishes his rights to select and control counsel and negotiate a settlement. The excess insurer, however, is well versed in insurance and legal practice and retains independent legal representation; it relinquishes no rights, has no contract with the primary insurer, and usually, as here, reserves the right to participate with the primary insurer in the control and defense of the claim. Under such circumstances, if Employer\u2019s desired information about the progress of litigation, it had the right to request it and should have done so. The district court was correct in holding that \u201cHome was under no duty to keep Employer\u2019s informed on the progress of the litigation .. . after Home <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"515\">*515</page-number>initially informed Employer\u2019s of the existence of the litigation absent any requests by Employer\u2019s for such information.\u201d</p>\n<p id=\"b627-5\">VIII. <em>Failure to Settle Personal Injury Claim</em></p>\n<p id=\"b627-7\">Mrs. Balkema did not file suit for personal injuries, but Employer\u2019s settled her potential claim for $5,000 and contends that Home\u2019s failure to recognize and settle the claim caused Employer\u2019s $5,000 damage. The district court, assuming that Home was negligent in failing to act upon Mrs. Balkema\u2019s claim, found no injury to Employer\u2019s. A payment by Home on this claim would simply have reduced the amount available under the primary policy and increased by that amount Employer\u2019s excess payment on the judgment. Given the court\u2019s findings that Home did not act in bad faith by refusing to settle the wrongful death claim and that Employer\u2019s was liable for the excess judgment in any event, we agree that settlement of Mrs. Balkema\u2019s claim would not have altered the sum Employer\u2019s ultimately paid to discharge its liability.</p>\n<p id=\"b627-8\">IX. <em>Contentions on Cross-Appeal</em></p>\n<p id=\"b627-9\">Home first contends that the district court erred in failing to find appellants negligent by reason of their failure to participate in the investigation, evaluation and defense of the Balkema claim. Having decided the case on other grounds, the district court did not consider this contention, and we see no need to address it here.</p>\n<p id=\"b627-10\">Home next contends that it was not required to defend against the Balkema claim under the terms of the Bohemia policy, and, therefore, \u201cit cannot be charged with a non-delegable duty to defend\u201d in good faith. This contention is simply moot because Home <em>did </em>undertake Bohemia\u2019s defense; and under its policy Home reserved the right to control the legal proceedings:</p>\n<blockquote id=\"b627-11\">The right to control the litigation in all of its aspects carries with it the correlative duty to exercise diligence, intelligence, good faith, honest and conscientious fidelity to the common interests of the parties.</blockquote>\n<p id=\"b627-12\"><em>Radcliffe, supra, </em>208 Or. 1, 298 P.2d at 1020 (quoting <em>Traders &amp; General Insurance Co. v. Rudco Oil, </em>129 F.2d 621, 627 (10 Cir. 1942)).</p>\n<p id=\"b627-13\">Finally, Home contends that the insured must suffer some damage before the excess insurer acquires a cause of action by subrogation. Because Bohemia was indemnified by its excess insurer, Home argues, it suffered no damage. We dismissed the same contention in <em>Valentine v. Aetna Insurance Co., </em>564 F.2d 292, 296-97 (9 Cir. 1977) (applying California law), observing that equitable subrogation permits the excess insurer to assume the position of the insured as if he lacked excess coverage. Standing in Bohemia\u2019s position under such circumstances, Employer\u2019s damages would have been clear had it proved Home negligent or guilty of bad faith.</p>\n<p id=\"b627-14\">X. <em>Conclusion</em></p>\n<p id=\"b627-15\">We conclude that the district court properly held in granting partial summary judgment that the policy limit was $100,000, and that the court did not err in finding, following trial, that (1) neither Home nor Ady was negligent or acted in bad faith in evaluating, investigating, or processing the wrongful death claim; (2) Home did not act in bad faith in refusing to settle the claim within its policy limits; (3) Home owed no duty to inform Employer\u2019s of the progress of the litigation after initially notifying it of the existence of the litigation with all essential information, absent requests by Employer\u2019s for further information; and (4) Home\u2019s failure to recognize and settle the personal injury claim did not cause Employer\u2019s any damage. We, therefore, affirm the judgment of the district court.</p>\n<footnote label=\"1\">\n<p id=\"b621-9\">. The district court noted that the \u201cbarge was not at fault\u201d and \u201cBohemia\u2019s liability as owner of the tug does not trigger coverage on the barge.\u201d</p>\n</footnote>\n<footnote label=\"2\">\n<p id=\"b621-10\">. State rules of construction do not differ significantly from those applied in most admiralty courts. Compare <em>First Far West Transportation v. Carolina Casualty Insurance Co., </em>47 Or.App. 339, 614 P.2d 1187, 1190 (1980) (ambiguities in insurance policy construed against insurer) <em>with Navieros Oceanikos </em>v. <em>S.T. Mobil Trader, </em>554 F.2d 43, 47 (2 Cir.1977) (ambiguities in maritime contract construed against drafter).</p>\n<p id=\"b621-15\">Employer\u2019s argued to the district court that the policy is ambiguous and ought to be construed against the insurer. The district court implicitly rejected this contention by relying on <em>Vest Transportation Co., supra, </em>in which the court considered identical provisions of a marine indemnity policy and concluded they \u201cleave no room for doubt or ambiguity as to who is insured, in what capacity he is insured, and for which losses he will be indemnified.\u201d 500 F.Supp. at 1374.</p>\n</footnote>\n<footnote label=\"3\">\n<p id=\"b622-11\">. <em>Cf. Nordeutscher Lloyd v. Jones Stevedoring Co., </em>490 F.2d 648, 649 (9 Cir.1973) (stevedoring indemnity policy is maritime in nature and controlled by federal, not state law). Some circuits hold as a general rule that interpretation of marine insurance policies is governed by federal law. See, <em>e.g., Corbitt v. Diamond M. Drilling Co., </em>654 F.2d 329, 332 (5 Cir.1981); <em>Navieros Oceanikos v. S.T. Mobil Trader, </em>554 F.2d 43, 47 (2 Or. 1977).</p>\n</footnote>\n<footnote label=\"4\">\n<p id=\"b623-8\">. The court placed no apparent weight on its erroneous finding in succeeding findings and conclusions. The court further noted that Ady anticipated a plaintiff\u2019s verdict well below the policy limits. We may infer as well that the high settlement value set by the court does not reflect a serious belief in the possibility of a defense verdict.</p>\n</footnote>\n<footnote label=\"5\">\n<p id=\"b623-9\">. The court correctly observed that \u201c[m]uch of the information needed to formulate settlement strategy, such as local jury verdict history in similar cases, local perception of the defendant, the competence of opposing counsel, knowledge of the trial judge, and so on, must come from the local defense counsel.\u201d In fact, insurers are sometimes negligent in ignoring the advice of competent counsel. Compare <em>Robertson v. Hartford Accident &amp; Indemnity Co., </em>333 F.Supp. 739, 740 (D.Or. 1970) (attorney recommended prompt settlement, insurer refused) <em>with Allen v. Allstate Insurance Co., </em>656 F.2d 487, 489 (9 Cir.1981) (insurer\u2019s reliance on attorney was \u201cwishful thinking\u201d).</p>\n</footnote>\n<footnote label=\"6\">\n<p id=\"b624-7\">. We emphasize, however, that Home did not owe an independent duty to Employer\u2019s but rather a single duty to Bohemia whose rights, if any, Employer\u2019s acquired through equitable subrogation. See, <em>e.g., Valentine v. Aetna Insurance Co., supra, </em>564 F.2d at 298; <em>Peter v. Travelers Insurance Co., </em>375 F.Supp. 1347, 1350 (C.D.Cal.1974).</p>\n</footnote>\n<footnote label=\"7\">\n<p id=\"b624-12\">. It is significant also that under the indemnity policy defense costs were paid before applying the balance to satisfy the claim. Thus once a <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"513\">*513</page-number>defense was undertaken, the exact policy limit was no longer available, and as the defense continued, the amount available for settlement continued to diminish.</p>\n</footnote>\n<footnote label=\"8\">\n<p id=\"b625-8\">. Home raised its offer to $50,000 when a juror gave damaging answers during voir dire. The court found that when that offer was rejected Ady intended to seek authority for $75,000 but was advised that the estate wanted to proceed to trial. As the Oregon court held in <em>Eastham, </em>\u201cThe conduct must be evaluated in the circumstances in which the company acted or failed to act.\u201d <em>Eastham, supra, </em>273 Or. at 608, 540 P.2d at 368.</p>\n</footnote>\n<footnote label=\"9\">\n<p id=\"b626-6\">. The district court erroneously found that Alex Parks, Ady\u2019s senior partner, negotiated the renewal and advised Employer\u2019s to set up a $50,-000 reserve to cover the claim. The parties agree that Doug Parks, Alex\u2019s son, negotiated the renewal while working for Sause and did not recommend creating a reserve. Although clearly erroneous, the court\u2019s finding neither belies its other related findings nor undermines its conclusion of law.</p>\n<p id=\"b626-7\">Employer\u2019s argues that it was misled by Sause\u2019s suggestion that the case would likely be settled. We do not think the insurance agent\u2019s opinion was so misleading as to relieve</p>\n<p id=\"Akr\">Employer\u2019s of all obligation to seek confirmation from the Home itself, to request further information from its insured, or to actually join in the defense in order to protect its interests.</p>\n</footnote>\n<footnote label=\"10\">\n<p id=\"b626-10\">. Employer\u2019s policy provided that it shall have the right and be given the opportunity to associate with the assured and primary carrier \u201cin the defense and control of any claim, suit or proceeding which involves or appears likely to involve the Company.\u201d Although fully advised regarding the accident and claim, Employer\u2019s made no request to participate in the defense of the claim.</p>\n</footnote>\n</opinion>\n</casebody>\n",
