The sole issue on appeal is whether the stipulated record es<page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"81\">*81</page-number>tablishes that the grain shipments in question constitute interstate commerce. The Minnesota commission concedes that it may not regulate trucking rates if the carriage has been in interstate commerce.</p>\n<p id=\"b193-5\">According to the stipulation of facts, more than 98% of the grain received at the river and lake terminals to which the \u201cdetention charge\u201d applies is shipped from those terminals to points outside Minnesota. Citing this fact, and applying the relevant case law, the district court in a thorough opinion concluded that the truck shipments of grain from the country elevators to the terminals \u201cconstitute the first leg of a large and constantly recurring course of interstate commerce,\u201d at 25, and as such fall beyond the scope of the state\u2019s regulatory power. The court rejected the contention of the Minnesota commission that the truck shipments were intrastate commerce because the initial shipper \u2014 the country elevator \u2014 intended no destination other than the terminal elevator located in Minnesota.</p>\n<p id=\"b193-6\">On the stipulated record, no error of law or fact appears on the part of the district court. Accordingly, we affirm the judgment of the district court and adopt the rationale of its opinion.</p>\n<footnote label=\"1\">\n<p id=\"b192-21\">. The Honorable Paul A.
