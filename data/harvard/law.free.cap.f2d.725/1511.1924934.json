The appellant waived his right to jury sentence recommendation. After a sentencing hearing, the Florida circuit judge sentenced him to death. The Florida Supreme Court affirmed the conviction and sentence, and the United States Supreme Court denied certiorari, <em>Palmes v. State, </em>397 So.2d 648 (Fla.), <em>cert. denied, </em>454 U.S. 882, 102 S.Ct. 369, 70 L.Ed.2d 195 (1981).</p>\n<p id=\"b1617-26\">On May 18, 1982 the Governor of Florida signed a death warrant for appellant\u2019s execution. On June 7, 1982 appellant initiated a federal habeas corpus petition in the United States District Court for the Middle District of Florida. The district court stayed appellant\u2019s execution and granted leave to amend the petition.<footnotemark>1</footnotemark> The petition was <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"1514\">*1514</page-number>amended in August 1982. The district court stayed the proceedings and ordered appellant to exhaust state remedies on the new claims. Appellant then filed a motion to vacate in the state trial court which was denied in October, 1982. In January, 1983, the Florida Supreme Court affirmed the trial judge\u2019s denial of the motion. <em>Palmes v. State, </em>425 So.2d 4 (Fla.1983).</p>\n<p id=\"b1618-4\">In January, 1983, appellant filed a Second Amended Petition for a Writ of Habeas Corpus in the district court for the Middle District of Florida. The district judge denied the petition and this appeal was taken. We affirm the district judge\u2019s denial of relief.</p>\n<p id=\"b1618-5\">Appellant raises eleven issues, but only seven are properly before this court. The remaining four issues are barred from review according to <em>Wainwright v. Sykes, </em>433 U.S. 72, 97 S.Ct. 2497, 53 L.Ed.2d 594 (1977) <em>(See infra </em>Part IY). The issues properly before this court are:</p>\n<blockquote id=\"b1618-6\">I. (a) Whether the admission into evidence of the appellant\u2019s statements and confessions violate his constitutional rights in that the statements were not voluntarily made; and</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b1618-7\">(b) Whether the admission into evidence of such statements denied the appellant a fair trial.</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b1618-8\">II. Whether appellant was denied the effective assistance of counsel when:</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b1618-10\">(a) First appointed counsel failed to render any legal assistance on behalf of the appellant at a critical stage of his case.</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b1618-11\">(b) Second appointed counsel failed to raise the issue concerning the appellant\u2019s illegal arrest.</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b1618-12\">(c) Second appointed counsel failed to object to the court\u2019s excusing for cause jurors expressing death penalty scruples.</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b1618-13\">(d) Counsel failed to object to comments touching upon appellant\u2019s fifth amendment rights.</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b1618-16\">III. Whether the trial judge\u2019s sentence of death is contrary to the eighth and fourteenth amendments.</blockquote>\n<p id=\"b1618-17\">FACTS</p>\n<p id=\"b1618-18\">In August or September 1976, the appellant and Ronald Straight offered to collect the victim\u2019s delinquent business accounts for him. The victim refused to employ the appellant, prompting the appellant to say, \u201cYou know, I am going to kill him.\u201d<footnotemark>2</footnotemark> On October 3, 1976 the appellant with his girlfriend, Jane Alpert, and Ronald Straight purchased lumber, hardware, and cement with which the appellant built a heavy box large enough to hold a man.</p>\n<p id=\"b1618-19\">The next day the group implemented their murder plan. Jane Alpert lured the victim into an apartment where the appellant and Ronald Straight were waiting for him. The appellant and Straight hit the victim on the head three times with a blunt instrument and stabbed him fourteen times. The victim\u2019s body was placed in the box, cement was added and it was dumped in the St. John\u2019s River. The appellant, Straight, and Alpert fled, taking the victim\u2019s car, money, and personal effects with them. Appellant, Alpert, and Straight were apprehended in California. On October 14, 1976 Ms. Alpert was returned to Jacksonville, Florida. She was given immunity from prosecution in exchange for her testimony in the prosecution of the appellant and Ronald Straight.</p>\n<p id=\"b1618-20\">Appellant was returned to Jacksonville on October 22, 1976. He was advised of his constitutional rights and then questioned by police. At appellant\u2019s first appearance on October 23rd a public defender was appointed to represent him. On October 24th appellant was again advised of his rights and further interrogated. He did not request counsel and answered the police questions. Appellant did, however, refuse to sign a written waiver of rights and refused to make any statement until he had spoken with Jane Alpert. After speaking with Al<page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"1515\">*1515</page-number>pert, appellant directed police officers to the place where the victim\u2019s body was thrown into the river.</p>\n<p id=\"b1619-5\">On October 28th appellant was indicted for first degree murder. On October 29th he asked to speak with the police. He was again advised of his rights and specifically stated he did not want a lawyer. Appellant then signed a written waiver of rights and gave his confession. Also on October 29th the public defender\u2019s office requested and was granted permission to withdraw as appellant\u2019s counsel due to conflict. Between October 23rd and October 29th the public defender\u2019s office had no contact with appellant. He was never interviewed or advised by any attorney during this period.</p>\n<p id=\"b1619-6\">The appellant\u2019s defense was largely his own testimony. He testified that Jane Alpert, acting alone, murdered the victim. His involvement was only to aid her after she had committed the murder.</p>\n<p id=\"b1619-7\">I. USE OF APPELLANT\u2019S CONFESSION AT TRIAL</p>\n<p id=\"b1619-8\">(a) Was the Confession Voluntarily Given?</p>\n<p id=\"b1619-9\">Appellant asserts that the incriminating statements and confession were not voluntarily and freely made. This contention belies the facts adduced at the hearing on the Motion to Suppress. On October 22nd, upon arrival in Jacksonville, appellant was given his <em>Miranda </em>warnings and was briefly questioned. On October 24th at 2:40 p.m. questioning resumed after appellant was again informed of his rights. Appellant indicated then that he was willing to speak with the officers. The interrogation ended at 6:30 p.m., after appellant indicated he wished to talk to his girlfriend, Jane Alpert, before he would be willing to give a statement.</p>\n<p id=\"b1619-10\">At 7:40 p.m. that evening police officers resumed the interrogation while attempting to contact the state attorney\u2019s office to obtain permission for Jane Alpert to telephone the appellant. Before this session, appellant was again informed of his constitutional rights and police officers questioned him \u201coff and on\u201d until midnight when Jane Alpert called. Appellant spoke to Alpert briefly and hung up after she told him she was getting her life in order and she was through with him. Appellant then said he would take the police to the location of the victim\u2019s body. At 12:30 a.m. on October 25th appellant was again informed of his constitutional rights before he led police officers to the site where the victim\u2019s body had been dumped into the St. John\u2019s River. After pointing out the location the appellant was driven back to jail. On the ride back to the county jail the appellant related some of the facts of the murder to police officers. At no time during the questioning between October 22nd and October 25th did the appellant state that he wanted an attorney or that he did not want to speak to the police officers. However, he did refuse to sign a written waiver of rights form.</p>\n<p id=\"b1619-12\">After returning the appellant to jail in the early morning hours of October 25th, police personnel made no attempt to contact or further question him. On October 28th he was indicted for first degree murder. On October 29th appellant told jailhouse trustees that he wished to speak with police officers. The officers were not immediately contacted so appellant prevailed upon the jail chaplain to phone the police requesting that they meet with him.</p>\n<p id=\"b1619-13\">At 4:00 p.m. on October 29th the police met with appellant. He indicated he wanted to make a statement. He was again informed of his rights and exhaustively questioned about whether he wanted an attorney. He said he did not, and signed a written waiver of rights form. It took an hour for appellant to relate his statement which was transcribed and notarized by a court reporter. During that hour appellant was again read his <em>Miranda </em>rights after he had taken a break to go to the bathroom.</p>\n<p id=\"b1619-14\">The district court found that the uncon-troverted testimony indicated that petitioner was mentally alert during all of these interrogations. The physical circumstances of the questioning were comfortable and the appellant was given food and water and allowed to use the bathroom. The physical <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"1516\">*1516</page-number>circumstances and manner of interrogation do not suggest coercion.</p>\n<p id=\"b1620-4\"><em>Miranda v. Arizona, </em>384 U.S. 436, 86 S.Ct. 1602, 16 L.Ed.2d 694 (1966) established that incriminating statements made by a defendant during a custodial interrogation are admissible into evidence if adequate measures are taken to apprise the defendant of his privilege against self-incrimination. The defendant must \u201cvoluntarily, knowingly, and intelligently\u201d waive his privilege. The voluntariness of appellant\u2019s confession is gauged by the totality of the circumstances. <em>Edwards v. Arizona, </em>451 U.S. 477, 482, 101 S.Ct. 1880, 1884, 68 L.Ed.2d 378 (1981).</p>\n<p id=\"b1620-5\">The record is clear that the transcribed confession taken on October 29th was voluntary. Appellant initiated the interview, was exhaustively made aware of his rights,<footnotemark>3</footnotemark> and signed the written waiver form. Perhaps most indicative of the voluntariness is that for four days prior to October 29th police officers had not contacted appellant and that it was the appellant who initiated the contact. <em>See Edwards v. Arizona, </em>451 U.S. at 483, 101 S.Ct. at 1884. At each level of review in the state and federal courts, it has been found that the appellant\u2019s statements were voluntary. The record fully supports this conclusion. On October 25th the appellant initially refused to discuss the crime until after he spoke with Ms. Alpert. Such action is a clear indication that he knew and understood his right to remain silent. After learning that Ms. Alpert had been given immunity from prosecution and had cooperated with the law enforcement representatives, Palmes willingly confessed all. The totality of the circumstances supports the finding that appellant\u2019s statements and confession were voluntarily given.</p>\n<p id=\"b1620-20\">The district court found that the appellant had waived his right to counsel and we agree. Appellant was repeatedly informed of his right to counsel. There has been no suggestion that he did not understand. To the contrary, the record indicates that he fully understood his rights and chose to speak with police officers. The appellant attempts to counter the state\u2019s showing of waiver by suggesting that his initial refusal to sign a written waiver of rights form <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"1517\">*1517</page-number>should be construed as an invocation of the right to counsel. If appellant did invoke the right to counsel interrogation would have to stop under <em>Miranda. </em>The record indicates that on October 24th the appellant said he would speak to police without counsel yet he refused to sign the waiver of rights form. On Friday October 29th, before appellant gave the crucial written statement, he did sign the waiver of rights form. This court is asked to turn this statement, \u201cI will talk to you without counsel, but I won\u2019t sign a written waiver form,\u201d into \u201cI want an attorney.\u201d We are unwilling to construe appellant\u2019s refusal to sign as a request for counsel.</p>\n<p id=\"b1621-5\">In <em>Fare v. Michael C., </em>442 U.S. 707, 99 S.Ct. 2560, 61 L.Ed.2d 197 (1979) the Court decided that a juvenile suspect\u2019s statement that he wanted to see his probation officer was not to be construed as a request to remain silent or for his attorney. The juvenile in <em>Fare, </em>after asking to speak with his probation officer, went on to speak freely with police and incriminate himself. The Court\u2019s rationale was its perception of the role of a lawyer as distinguished from a probation officer and the <em>Miranda </em>doctrine. The Court explained:</p>\n<blockquote id=\"b1621-6\">The fact that a relationship of trust and cooperation between a probation officer and a juvenile might exist, however, does not indicate that the probation officer is capable of rendering effective legal advice sufficient to protect the juvenile\u2019s rights during interrogation by the police, or of providing the other services rendered by a lawyer. To find otherwise would be \u201can extension of the <em>Miranda </em>requirements [that] would cut this Court\u2019s holding in that case completely loose from its own explicitly stated rationale.\u201d <em>Beckwith v. United States, </em>425 U.S. 341, 345 [96 S.Ct. 1612, 1615, 48 L.Ed.2d 1] (1976). Such an extension would impose the burdens associated with the rule of <em>Miranda </em>on the juvenile justice system and the police without serving the interests that rule was designed simultaneously to protect. If it were otherwise, a juvenile\u2019s request for almost anyone he considered trustworthy enough to give him reliable advice would trigger the rigid rule of <em>Miranda.</em></blockquote>\n<p id=\"b1621-7\"><em>Id. </em>442 U.S. at 722-23, 99 S.Ct. at 2570-71. The Court\u2019s concern with keeping <em>Miranda </em>true to its purpose leads us to decline to construe appellant\u2019s refusal to sign the waiver form as a request for counsel.</p>\n<p id=\"b1621-8\">In <em>North Carolina v. Butler, </em>441 U.S. 369, 373 n. 5, 99 S.Ct. 1755, 1758 n. 5, 60 L.Ed.2d 286 (1978), the Supreme Court noted that the then eleven United States Courts of Appeal had unanimously rejected the argument that refusal to sign a waiver form precludes a finding of waiver. Therefore, there is no independent significance to the appellant\u2019s refusal to sign the waiver form. The record demonstrates that appellant knew of and understood his right to have counsel present at the interrogations. We affirm the district court\u2019s finding that the appellant waived his right to counsel and voluntarily confessed.</p>\n<p id=\"b1621-9\">(b) Did Allowing the Confession into Evidence Deny Appellant a Fundamentally Fair Trial?</p>\n<p id=\"b1621-10\">Appellant argues that he was denied a fair trial for two reasons. First, the trial judge did not find the confession voluntary prior to allowing it into evidence. Second, the judge erred in not allowing appellant to testify before the jury about his state of mind when he gave the confession. We easily dispose of the first part of this argument. <em>Jackson v. Denno, </em>378 U.S. 368, 84 S.Ct. 1774, 12 L.Ed.2d 908 (1964), requires a trial judge to determine the voluntariness of a confession before it is admitted into evidence. In <em>Sims v. Georgia, </em>385 U.S. 538, 544, 87 S.Ct. 639, 643, 17 L.Ed.2d 593 (1967) the Court explained that \u201c[although the judge need not make formal findings of fact or write an opinion, his conclusion that the confession is voluntary must appear from the record with unmistakable clarity.\u201d In this case the trial judge conducted a hearing according to <em>Jackson v. Denno. </em>During the hearing counsel argued and offered evidence on the question of voluntariness. The judge denied the motion to suppress. Although her order simply denied <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"1518\">*1518</page-number>the motion without specifically enunciating that the confession was found voluntary, inherent in the denial of the motion is a finding of voluntariness. The record in this case is \u201cunmistakably clear\u201d and we find no reason to require state trial judges to articulate all the reasons why a motion to suppress is denied.</p>\n<p id=\"b1622-4\">The second portion of this issue, whether refusing to allow the appellant to testify before the jury about the circumstances of his confession is reversible error, is more difficult to resolve. The trial judge did rule that the appellant could not testify about his state of mind when he gave the confession.<footnotemark>4</footnotemark> Nonetheless, appellant was allowed to testify that his motive for confessing was to protect Jane Alpert. (Ex.Vol. IX at 810-818). Even though the trial judge determines admissibility of a confession it is up to the jury to decide the weight it will give the confession. Trial testimony about the circumstances and voluntariness of the confession would have aided the jury in deciding what weight to accord appellant\u2019s confession.</p>\n<p id=\"b1622-5\">The Florida Supreme Court found that under Florida law the trial judge erred in refusing to allow the appellant to testify about the circumstances of the confession. <em>Palmes v. State, </em>397 So.2d at 653-56. Precedent in this circuit agrees with the Florida Supreme Court\u2019s decision. <em>Calloway v. Wainwright, </em>409 F.2d 59, 65 (5th Cir.), <em>cert. denied, </em>395 U.S. 909, 89 S.Ct. 1752, 23 L.Ed.2d 222 (1969). Appellant has phrased this issue as one of constitutional fairness dimensions, however, the basic error is an evidentiary question properly resolved by reference to Florida law.<footnotemark>5</footnotemark> We agree with the Florida Supreme Court\u2019s conclusion that under Florida law it was error to exclude this testimony. <em>See State v. Oyarzo, </em>274 So.2d 519 (Fla.1973); <em>Graham v. State, </em>91 So.2d 662 (Fla.1956); <em>Bates v. State, </em>78 Fla. 672, 84 So. 373 (1919).</p>\n<p id=\"b1622-11\">The Florida Supreme Court and the United States district court both went beyond the initial finding of error to conclude, based on all the evidence at trial, that this error was harmless.<footnotemark>6</footnotemark> We therefore must determine if this error is harmless or so substantial as to deny the appellant a fair trial. The doctrine of harmless error allows affirmance of criminal convictions if the non-constitutional error did not substantially influence the verdict and there was sufficient evidence to support the verdict apart from the error. <em>Kotteakos v. United States, </em>328 U.S. 750, 764-65, 66 S.Ct. 1239, 1247-48, 90 L.Ed. 1557 (1946); <em>United States v. Martinez, </em>700 F.2d 1358, 1367 (11th Cir.1983); <em>United States </em>v. <em>Phillips, </em>664 F.2d 971, 1027 &amp; n. 84 (5th Cir.1981) (Unit B).</p>\n<p id=\"b1622-12\">In analyzing whether this error was harmless, the Florida Supreme Court noted that although the trial judge improperly sustained the state objection, the appellant in fact did testify to the circumstances of his directing the police to the body and the series of conversations with police officers during the week of October 22, 1976.<footnotemark>7</footnotemark> Thus <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"1519\">*1519</page-number>the scope of the trial judge\u2019s ruling limiting testimony about the circumstances was narrow. Substantial testimony about the circumstances was allowed. The jury had a good impression of appellant\u2019s state of mind at the time he confessed.</p>\n<p id=\"b1623-5\">The trial judge had already determined the confession was voluntary. The erroneously excluded testimony would have only gone to the weight the jury should give the confession, for the confession was properly admitted into evidence. The district court and the Florida Supreme Court found substantial other evidence aside from the statement upon which appellant could have been convicted. Based on all the other evidence introduced and the fact that appellant was allowed to testify to some of the circumstances of the confession, we find that the trial judge\u2019s error was harmless.</p>\n<p id=\"b1623-6\">II. EFFECTIVENESS OF COUNSEL</p>\n<p id=\"b1623-7\">The appellant asserts he was denied effective assistance of counsel in four ways:</p>\n<p id=\"b1623-8\">a) During the week of October 22nd-29th the public defender\u2019s office, although appointed as appellant\u2019s counsel, never contacted him in any way and ultimately withdrew as counsel on October 29th due to conflict. Because of this, appellant argues that the confessions made during that week should have been suppressed.</p>\n<p id=\"b1623-9\">b) Trial counsel failed to argue that appellant\u2019s confession should have been suppressed due to an illegal arrest.</p>\n<p id=\"b1623-10\">c) Trial counsel failed to object to the court\u2019s excusal for cause of venirepersons expressing death penalty scruples in violation of <em>Witherspoon v. Illinois, </em>391 U.S. 510, 88 S.Ct. 1770, 20 L.Ed.2d 776 (1968).</p>\n<p id=\"b1623-11\">d) Trial counsel failed to object to the prosecutor\u2019s comments that touched upon appellant\u2019s fifth amendment rights.</p>\n<p id=\"b1623-12\">The sixth amendment promises criminal defendants the effective assistance of counsel. The standard for effectiveness is one of reasonableness: counsel must have rendered reasonably effective assistance given the totality of the circumstances. <em>King v. Strickland, </em>714 F.2d 1481, 1485 (11th Cir.1983); <em>Goodwin v. Balkcom, </em>684 F.2d 794, 804 (11th Cir.1982), <em>cert. denied, </em>\u2014 U.S. \u2014, 103 S.Ct. 1798, 76 L.Ed.2d 364 (1983). The appellant must carry the burden of proof that counsel was ineffective and that actual prejudice resulted. <em>Washington v. Strickland, </em>693 F.2d 1243, 1262 (5th Cir.1982) (Unit B, <em>en banc), cert. </em>granted, \u2014 U.S. \u2014, 103 S.Ct. 2451, 77 L.Ed.2d 1332 (1983). Whether appellant has been denied the effective assistance of counsel is a mixed question of law and fact. <em>Cuyler v. Sullivan, </em>446 U.S. 335, 341-42, 100 S.Ct. 1708, 1714-15, 64 L.Ed.2d 333 (1980); <em>Washington v. Watkins, </em>655 F.2d 1346, 1354 (5th Cir.1981). To decide this issue we must examine the totality of the circumstances and the entire record. <em>Goodwin v. Balkcom, </em>684 F.2d 794, 804 (11th Cir.1982), <em>cert. denied, </em>\u2014 U.S. \u2014, 103 S.Ct. 1798, 76 L.Ed.2d 364 (1983).</p>\n<p id=\"b1623-22\">a) The Week of October 22nd \u2014 29th</p>\n<p id=\"b1623-23\">Appellant\u2019s argument on this issue has two discrete components: first, was appellant denied the effective assistance of counsel during the police interrogations and second, was the public defender\u2019s failure to contact the appellant during this crucial week a violation of appellant\u2019s sixth amendment right.</p>\n<p id=\"b1623-24\">Appellant submits that he had a sixth amendment right to have counsel informed of and present at the police interrogations because the criminal process had shifted from investigation to accusation. <em>Massiah v. United States, </em>377 U.S. 201, 84 S.Ct. 1199, 12 L.Ed.2d 246 (1964). In <em>United States v. Brown, </em>569 F.2d 236 (5th Cir. 1978) <em>(en banc)</em><footnotemark><em>8</em></footnotemark><em> </em>the court found such an interpretation of <em>Massiah </em>to be too broad and refused to extend the sixth amendment right to counsel beyond instances of surreptitious or secret interrogation as in <em>Massiah. </em>569 F.2d at 238. Here, like <em>Brown, </em>the appellant knew he was being interrogated, was repeatedly advised of his rights, and <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"1520\">*1520</page-number>chose not to request counsel. The extraordinary rule in <em>Massiah </em>does not apply when the police are forthright in their interrogation. When appellant knew he was being questioned by the police and understood the consequences of his speech it was up to him to act in some manner to invoke his right to counsel. We have already concluded that the appellant waived his right to counsel during that week. Appellant was not denied the effective assistance of counsel during the police interrogations because he never invoked and voluntarily waived his right to counsel.</p>\n<p id=\"b1624-4\">Appellant also contends he was denied effective assistance of counsel during the week of October 22, 1976 because the public defender who was appointed to represent him on October 22nd never undertook that task. No one from the public defender\u2019s office ever contacted the appellant. On October 29th, one day after appellant's indictment, the public defender withdrew from appellant\u2019s case due to conflict. The Supreme Court of Florida found that \u201cthe formal appointment of the Public Defender at first appearance did not initiate legal representation since nothing was done toward actually providing legal counsel.\u201d <em>Palmes v. State, </em>397 So.2d at 652. Since no representation was undertaken, it could not have been ineffective. The district court ruled that the appellant waived his right to counsel so that there could be no issue of effectiveness.</p>\n<p id=\"b1624-5\">From appellant\u2019s standpoint it is lamentable that the Public Defender could not represent him. We acknowledge that the events during the first week after appellant\u2019s return to Florida were crucial to the state\u2019s case. If counsel had been able to represent appellant perhaps the inculpatory statements would have never been made.<footnotemark>9</footnotemark> We must, however, determine if the public defender\u2019s inaction violates the right to effective assistance of counsel. We find that the district court\u2019s conclusion, that because appellant waived his right to counsel there could be no question of effectiveness, embodies the wrong rationale. Waiver of counsel for a specific interrogation does not waive effectiveness of counsel in other instances. Here appellant claims counsel should have interviewed him during that week and advised him about his statements to police which is unrelated to the presence or absence of counsel during the custodial interrogations.</p>\n<p id=\"b1624-8\">The Florida Supreme Court reached the same result as the district court by concluding that the public defender never undertook to represent the appellant. This is supported by the record. Because of a conflict the public defender could not and did not represent the appellant. It is probable that had the public defender undertaken to give even the most preliminary advice to the appellant, this court would have to decide whether appellant was denied effective assistance of counsel during this period due to the conflict. The public defender had no choice but to withdraw from appellant\u2019s case. There are no allegations that the public defender was dilatory in seeking the court\u2019s permission to withdraw and the appointment of other counsel.</p>\n<p id=\"b1624-9\">We agree with the Florida Supreme Court that there could be no ineffective assistance of counsel because the public defender never undertook to represent the appellant. Had the appellant at any point during this five day period asked to see an attorney perhaps new counsel could have been appointed sooner. Appellant also sug<page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"1521\">*1521</page-number>gests that the police should have inquired as to who was representing the appellant and had the attorney present before any interrogation or waiver occurred. We have already concluded that the sixth amendment right explained in <em>Massiah </em>does not extend that far. In conclusion, none of the sixth amendment doctrines that appellant relies on allow a finding of ineffective assistance of counsel during the week of October 22nd-29th.</p>\n<p id=\"b1625-5\">b) Failure to Argue Suppression Due to Illegal Arrest</p>\n<p id=\"b1625-6\">Appellant contends that he was denied the effective assistance of counsel because his trial counsel failed to argue that the confession should be suppressed as the fruit of an illegal arrest. The appellant contends the arrest was illegal because there was no probable cause. Trial counsel did argue forcefully that the confession should be suppressed because it was not voluntarily made. The district court ruled that trial counsel made an informed decision, based on his professional expertise, to not pursue the illegal arrest basis for suppression. Alternatively, the district court found the argument meritless because so much time lapsed between the appellant\u2019s arrest and the confessions that the taint, if any, had dissipated.</p>\n<p id=\"b1625-7\">In this circuit \u201ca strategic decision to pursue less than all plausible lines of defense will rarely, if ever, be deemed ineffective if counsel first adequately investigated the rejected alternatives.\u201d <em>Adams v. Wainwright, </em>709 F.2d 1443, 1445 (11th Cir.1983), <em>citing, Westbrook v. Zant, </em>704 F.2d 1487, 1500 (11th Cir.1983). Trial counsel testified at the state hearing on this issue that he did not argue the confession was the product of an illegal arrest because he thought appellant was arrested for grand theft and that, in any event, a gun battle occurred prior to the arrest which alone would have constituted probable cause. Ex.Vol. XYII at 53-54. Appellant argues that if the federal district court had allowed an evidentiary hearing it would have been shown that appellant was in fact arrested in California for the Florida murder one day before the warrant for grand theft issued and that trial counsel\u2019s professional opinion was based on inadequate investigation.</p>\n<p id=\"b1625-12\">Trial counsel traveled to California to depose all the people involved in the California arrest. Certainly such a trip was sufficient investigation to meet the effectiveness of counsel standard. <em>See Washington </em>v. <em>Strickland, </em>693 F.2d at 1255 n. 21. Further, this was at least trial counsel\u2019s tenth murder defense. A motion to suppress was made but for other, perhaps more persuasive, reasons. We cannot say that trial counsel\u2019s decision was \u201cso patently unreasonable that no competent attorney would have chosen it.\u201d <em>Adams v. Wainwright, </em>709 F.2d at 1445, <em>citing, Washington v. Strickland, </em>693 F.2d at 1254.</p>\n<p id=\"b1625-13\">c) Failure to Object to Excusal for Cause</p>\n<p id=\"b1625-14\">Appellant asserts that trial counsel was ineffective because he failed to object to the court\u2019s dismissal of four venirepersons for death penalty scruples in violation of <em>Witherspoon v. Illinois, </em>391 U.S. 510, 88 S.Ct. 1770, 20 L.Ed.2d 776 (1968).<footnotemark>10</footnotemark> The record shows that trial counsel agreed to collective examination of prospective jurors and that the trial judge adequately explained the requirements of <em>Witherspoon </em>to the prospective jurors.<footnotemark>11</footnotemark> Trial counsel\u2019s failure to assert a <em>Witherspoon </em>violation <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"1522\">*1522</page-number>could have been the product of a reasonable conclusion that no violation had occurred. Given the totality of the voir dire, it is clear that counsel was \u201creasonably effective\u201d even though he did not raise a <em>Witherspoon </em>violation.</p>\n<p id=\"b1626-4\">d) Failure to Raise Fifth Amendment Violation</p>\n<p id=\"b1626-5\">Appellant\u2019s final claim of ineffective assistance of counsel stems from trial counsel\u2019s failure to object to statements by the prosecutor that allegedly infringed upon appellant\u2019s fifth amendment right to remain silent. Appellant points to two statements that he contends violate his fifth amendment privilege. The first occurred during defense counsel\u2019s cross-examination of a state witness.</p>\n<blockquote id=\"b1626-6\">Q: What did she tell you about if Mr. Stone was coming back?</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b1626-7\">PROSECUTOR: Excuse me, Your Hon- or. I\u2019m not sure what day we are referring to.</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b1626-8\">DEFENSE COUNSEL: I\u2019m talking about October 4th.</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b1626-10\">PROSECUTOR: I object, Your Honor. It\u2019s beyond the scope of direct examination.</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b1626-11\">DEFENSE COUNSEL: Your Honor, I think that he has testified he was working there on that date and it\u2019s extremely relevant what occurred on that date.</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"AmZZ\">PROSECUTOR: He didn\u2019t. He didn\u2019t testify he worked there on direct examination on October 4th.</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b1626-15\">I only \u2014 direct examination dealt only with September 25th.</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b1626-16\">\n<em>The Prosecutor can call him as his own witness if he wishes.</em>\n</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b1626-17\">The second statement occurred at the conclusion of the testimony of a key state witness, Pat Miles.</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b1626-18\">THE COURT: All right, gentlemen.</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"Axrn\">PROSECUTOR: Nothing further.</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b1626-19\">THE COURT: Any further questions by the State?</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b1626-20\">PROSECUTOR: Nothing further, Your Honor.</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b1626-21\">DEFENSE COUNSEL: Nothing further from the defense, Your Honor.</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b1626-22\">THE COURT: All right.</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"AxEX\">Do you anticipate needing this witness for further testimony, Mr. Greene?</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"AzQS\">PROSECUTOR: <em>It\u2019s possible, Your Hon- or, the State may need him in rebuttal.</em></blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"AW0\">THE COURT: Sargeant Miles, you are going to be excused. <em>However, remain available in the event you are needed for recall. </em>(R.Vol. II at 333).</blockquote>\n<p id=\"b1626-24\">Only a very keen trial attorney could have perceived that these statements might infringe upon the appellant\u2019s fifth amendment privilege by elliptical reference to the appellant\u2019s future testimony. Appellant\u2019s brief cites no authority that supports the substantive fifth amendment claim. Quite frankly, it is difficult for the court to see any merit in the contention. Appellant <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"1523\">*1523</page-number>chose to testify in his own defense, therefore, his fifth amendment privilege was probably waived. Trial counsel certainly cannot be deemed to have been ineffective for failing to raise this tenuous objection.</p>\n<p id=\"b1627-5\">Attorneys have many legal tools to use in their <em>discretion </em>to properly defend a person. The sixth amendment right to effective assistance of counsel does not require counsel to raise every objection without regard to its merits. The sixth amendment standard is one of reasonable effectiveness. We find that appellant\u2019s trial counsel was not ineffective.</p>\n<p id=\"b1627-6\">III. IS APPELLANT\u2019S SENTENCE OF DEATH CONTRARY TO THE EIGHTH AND FOURTEENTH AMENDMENTS</p>\n<p id=\"b1627-7\">Appellant argues that the sentencing procedure used in his case and the Florida Statute\u2019s aggravating factor of \u201cheinous, atrocious, and cruel\u201d conduct are unconstitutional. Fla.Stat. \u00a7 921.141(5)(h) (1975). Appellant waived the jury for the penalty phase of his trial and was sentenced to death after a hearing before the trial judge. At the sentencing hearing appellant\u2019s attorney attacked perceived inaccuracies and bias in the presentence investigation that was presented to the court and called six character witnesses to testify about the appellant. Appellant\u2019s counsel argued statutory and non-statutory mitigating factors and pointed out the disparity in treatment between the appellant and Jane Alpert, who was granted full immunity from prosecution. A psychiatric report that discussed the possible effect of drugs on appellant\u2019s behavior was also introduced. At the conclusion of the hearing the trial judge read a prepared sentence of death.</p>\n<p id=\"b1627-8\">Appellant does not assert any flaw in the sentencing procedure. He does not contend that there was a systemic bias or prejudice or even that this trial judge was biased. His argument is that the trial judge did not render a reasoned decision based on the evidence presented during the sentencing hearing. In support of this contention, appellant points out that the sentence was meted out immediately following the conclusion of the sentencing hearing. Appellant offers no evidence of this contention and probably could not produce any. The nature of this assertion is inherently unreviewable. We cannot review the thinking of a trial judge for such would be pure conjecture. We may only examine the procedure and the written order. None of the numerous cases appellant cites to this court would have otherwise. <em>See Proffitt v. Florida, </em>428 U.S. 242, 96 S.Ct. 2960, 49 L.Ed.2d 913 (1976); <em>Woodson v. North Carolina, </em>428 U.S. 280, 96 S.Ct. 2978, 49 L.Ed.2d 944 (1976).</p>\n<p id=\"b1627-11\">Appellant contends that the trial judge erred in not considering non-statutory mitigating factors that were presented during the sentencing hearing. In her judgment and order of death the trial judge discusses only the statutory aggravating and mitigating factors in <em>Fla.Stat. </em>\u00a7 921.-141. Again we cannot conclude that because the order discusses only the statutorily mandated factors that the other evidence in mitigation was not considered. Appellant\u2019s citation to <em>Eddings v. Oklahoma, </em>455 U.S. 104, 102 S.Ct. 869, 71 L.Ed.2d 1 (1982), in which the Court held that a trial judge may not as a matter of law refuse to consider evidence of mitigation, is not persuasive. Here the trial judge patiently heard all of the evidence appellant had to offer. The weight the trial judge gave to any one factor was wholly within her discretion. <em>See Barclay v. Florida, </em>\u2014 U.S. \u2014, 103 S.Ct. 3418, 3430 n. 2, 77 L.Ed.2d 1134 (1983) (Stevens and Powell, JJ. concurring). Our review is completed once it is established that a full hearing was conducted in which appellant\u2019s counsel was given an opportunity to present all of the mitigation evidence. There is no indication whatsoever that the trial judge did not conscientiously consider everything presented.</p>\n<p id=\"b1627-15\">Appellant also contends that the statutory aggravating factor of \u201cheinous, atrocious, and cruel\u201d conduct is unconstitutionally vague in its application.\u201d<footnotemark>12</footnotemark> This <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"1524\">*1524</page-number>contention was rejected in <em>Proffitt v. Florida, </em>428 U.S. at 255-56, 96 S.Ct. at 2968 (Stewart, Powell and Stevens, JJ.). <em>See also, Barclay v. </em>Florida, \u2014 U.S. \u2014, 103 S.Ct. 3418, 77 L.Ed.2d 1134 (1983). We find that the trial judge properly applied this factor. We conclude based on the record that the trial judge met the constitutional sentencing standard of an <em>\u201cindividualized </em>determination on the basis of the character of the individual and the circumstances of the crime.\u201d 103 S.Ct. at 3428.</p>\n<p id=\"b1628-6\">Finally, appellant claims that his sentence violates the eighth and fourteenth amendments because it is so disproportionate to the grant of immunity to Jane Alpert. Ronald Straight, another actor in this murder scheme was also sentenced to death. The Supreme Court has stated that discretionary decisions of state prosecutors to grant immunity to some participants of a crime and not others is not arbitrary or cruel and unusual under the constitution. <em>See Gregg v. Georgia, </em>428 U.S. 153, 199, 96 S.Ct. 2909, 2937, 49 L.Ed.2d 859 (1976) (Justices Stewart, Powell, and Stevens); <em>Proffitt </em>v. <em>Florida, </em>428 U.S. at 254, 96 S.Ct. at 2967. Appellant\u2019s claim that Jane Alpert was not similarly punished is not a cognizable basis for relief.</p>\n<p id=\"b1628-7\">IV. ISSUES BARRED FROM REVIEW DUE TO PROCEDURAL DEFAULT</p>\n<p id=\"b1628-8\">Appellant raises four additional substantive issues:</p>\n<p id=\"b1628-11\">(1) Whether appellant\u2019s statements and confession were the product of an illegal arrest and detention;</p>\n<p id=\"b1628-12\">(2) Whether prospective jurors were improperly excused for cause because of conscientious concerns about the death penalty in violation of <em>Witherspoon </em>v. <em>Illinois;</em></p>\n<p id=\"b1628-13\">(3) Whether the prosecutor improperly commented upon the appellant\u2019s fifth amendment right to remain silent; and</p>\n<p id=\"b1628-14\">(4) Whether the appellant was denied a fair trial by the conduct of certain jurors who allegedly formed and expressed opinions concerning guilt before hearing all of the evidence.</p>\n<p id=\"b1628-15\">All of these issues have been addressed as bases for the ineffective assistance of counsel claim, however, the standard of review is different if we must review these issues on their substantive merits. These issues were raised initially in the first amended habeas corpus petition in the district court. Pursuant to the district court\u2019s order to exhaust state remedies these issues were raised in the Florida courts in the Motion to Vacate. The Florida Supreme Court ruled that, under Florida law, all four of these issues should have been raised on direct appeal and could not be raised in a collateral proceeding. <em>Palmes v. State, </em>425 So.2d 4 (Fla.1983). The district court then found that these issues were barred from habeas corpus review under <em>Wainwright v. Sykes, </em>433 U.S. 72, 97 S.Ct. 2497, 53 L.Ed.2d 594 <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"1525\">*1525</page-number>(1977) and <em>Ford v. Strickland, </em>696 F.2d 804 (11th Cir.1983) <em>(en banc).</em></p>\n<p id=\"b1629-4\">The rule of <em>Wainwright v. Sykes </em>prohibits a federal court from entertaining a constitutional claim in a habeas corpus petition if that claim is barred by the state law due to a procedural default. The rule furthers comity and helps assure that the state trial is the primary adjudication and not just a prelude to a federal adjudication. In this case, these issues are barred due to default under Florida law. Relief may be had from the rule only upon a showing of \u201ccause and prejudice.\u201d In this circuit \u201ccause\u201d to excuse a procedural default must be avoidance of \u201ca miscarriage of justice,\u201d and prejudice is \u201cactual prejudice.\u201d <em>Ford v. Strickland, </em>696 F.2d at 817.</p>\n<p id=\"b1629-5\">Appellant attempts to show cause for the failure to argue that his arrest was illegal by asserting that trial counsel\u2019s failure to raise this issue was the result of ignorance of the facts and in no way was a deliberate attempt to bypass the state procedure. Appellant urges the court to define \u201ccause\u201d as any reason other than a strategic decision to forego state adjudication of the claim, <em>citing, Huffman v. Wainwright, </em>651 F.2d 347, 351 (5th Cir.1981) (Unit B). Such a broad standard of \u201ccause\u201d would vitiate the rule of <em>Wainwright v. Sykes </em>and disregard its purposes of comity, of providing federal courts a state court adjudication of constitutional issues, and encouraging state courts to enforce procedural rules strictly. <em>Huffman </em>did not so read the \u201ccause\u201d factor and we too reject this interpretation.</p>\n<p id=\"b1629-6\">The district court found little probability that the arrest was illegal. It further noted that because so much time lapsed between appellant\u2019s arrest and the confessions, the taint, if any, had dissipated. We found that the failure to raise this issue at trial was not ineffective assistance of counsel. In determining whether sufficient \u201ccause\u201d exists to meet the manifest injustice standard, our purpose is not to reach the merits of the very issue barred by procedural default. We find no ignorance by counsel which yielded a manifest injustice, therefore, the illegality of appellant\u2019s arrest is barred from review.</p>\n<p id=\"b1629-8\">Appellant attempts to show cause for trial counsel\u2019s failure to object to the manner of jury selection by asserting that (1) such an objection would have been futile due to the policy of the Fourth Judicial Circuit of Florida that excludes every juror expressing death penalty scruples and (2) counsel believed the trial judge\u2019s actions were proper and didn\u2019t want to make a dubious objection that would emphasize the death sentence potential to the jurors. These assertions do not meet the \u201ccause\u201d criterion. In <em>Engle v. Isaac, </em>456 U.S. 107, 102 S.Ct. 1558, 71 L.Ed.2d 783 (1982) the Supreme Court-noted that \u201cthe futility of presenting an objection to the state courts cannot alone constitute cause for failure to object at trial.\u201d <em>Id. </em>at 130, 102 S.Ct. at 1572. The second part of appellant\u2019s case for cause here suggests a strategic decision not to raise this issue. Issues not raised for strategic reasons are certainly barred by the rule in <em>Wainwright v. Sykes.</em></p>\n<p id=\"b1629-9\">Appellant moved for a mistrial after learning of the juror\u2019s discussion of the evidence. The trial judge denied the motion and this issue was not raised on direct appeal. The Florida Supreme Court ruled it was barred from collateral review. Appellant\u2019s only assertion of cause is the same as that argued in the first issue, namely, that since the decision not to appeal this issue was not a tactical choice to avoid the state courts the federal courts should hear this issue. For the already enunciated reasons we reject this argument and hold this issue barred under <em>Wainwright v. Sykes.</em></p>\n<p id=\"b1629-10\">Finally, appellant argues that the right to remain silent free from adverse comment is such a fundamental right that its exalted constitutional stature alone should be sufficient \u201ccause\u201d for relief from the <em>Sykes </em>rule. In <em>Engles v. Isaac, supra, </em>the Court acknowledged that \u201c[w]hile the nature of a constitutional claim may affect the calculation of cause and actual prejudice, it does not alter the need to make that threshold showing.\u201d 456 U.S. at 129, 102 S.Ct. at 1572. Because appellant has made no show<page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"1526\">*1526</page-number>ing of cause we hold that this issue too is barred. We do not examine the prejudice, if any, that resulted from the failure to raise these issues because the <em>Sykes </em>standard for relief from its rule is in the conjunctive. Having failed to show \u201ccause,\u201d appellant necessarily fails the conjunctive.</p>\n<p id=\"b1630-4\">For all of the foregoing reasons the decision of the district court is AFFIRMED.</p>\n<footnote label=\"1\">\n<p id=\"b1617-17\">. In September 1980, the appellant joined other death row inmates in challenging the Florida Supreme Court\u2019s review of certain materials outside the record. Relief was denied. <em>Brown v.

When defense counsel attempted to elicit testimony of voluntariness during direct examination of the appellant the state objected. A recess was ordered during which the state argued that because the issue of voluntariness had been decided at the suppression hearing and because the appellant chose not to testify at that hearing, he should not be allowed to testify at trial on this issue.

Illinois, </em>378 U.S. 478, 488, 84 S.Ct. 1758, 1763, 12 L.Ed.2d 977 (1964). We agree with the statement, however, the prophy-latic rules of <em>Miranda </em>and <em>Massiah </em>have yet to be extended to such a degree that criminal defendants are presumed to lack the rational facilities of choice. Appellant chose not to have counsel present during the interrogation. Many might wonder why anyone being questioned would make statements incriminating themselves in criminal activity. The response is that \u201cconfession is good for the soul.\u201d Some suggest that remorse motivates such confessions. These are among the very few issues courts need not decide. Regardless of why, the appellant made what has been found to be an informed voluntary choice.</p>\n</footnote>\n<footnote label=\"10\">\n<p id=\"b1625-8\">. The substantive <em>Witherspoon </em>issue is barred because it was not raised on direct appeal or in the state habeas proceedings. <em>See infra </em>\u00a7 IV.</p>\n</footnote>\n<footnote label=\"11\">\n<p id=\"b1625-9\">. The following is the trial judge\u2019s explanation of the <em>Witherspoon </em>doctrine:</p>\n<p id=\"b1625-10\">The Court will now explain to you the standard by which a qualification to serve as a jury is to be measured. The Court will then ask you to search your own conscience and to tell the Court whether measured by that standard you feel that you are qualified to serve as a juror. The fact that you may have reservations about, or conscious or religious scruples against capital punishment, does not disqualify you to serve as a juror. It is entirely possible that a juror who believes that capital punishment should never be inflicted, and who is irrevocably committed to its abolition, could nevertheless subordinate his personal views to what he perceives to be his duty to abide by his oath as a juror and to obey the law of the State. If you are willing to consider rendering a verdict that might result in the death penalty and are not irrevocably committed, before the trial <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"1522\">*1522</page-number>begins, to vote against a verdict that may result in the penalty of death, regardless of the facts and circumstances that might emerge in the course of the proceedings, you are qualified to serve as a juror. However, if you would automatically vote against a verdict that might result in the penalty of death without regard to any evidence that might be developed at trial, or if your attitude toward the penalty of death would prevent you from making an impartial decision as to the defendant\u2019s guilt, then you are not qualified to serve as a juror.</p>\n<p id=\"b1626-13\">Please examine your own conscience and tell the Court whether measured by that standard you feel that you are qualified to serve as a juror.</p>\n<p id=\"b1626-14\">In summary, if after searching your conscience you would automatically vote against a verdict of guilty despite the facts and circumstances merely because it could result in the penalty of death, then you would not be qualified to serve as a juror. On the other hand, if your attitude towards the death penalty would prevent you from making an impartial decision, an impartial decision as to the defendant\u2019s guilt, I would now like for you to raise your hands. Does anybody sitting in the jury box feel that despite any facts and circumstances which may be proved that you would automatically vote against a verdict if you were convinced that the defendant is guilty; you would automatically vote against a verdict which could result in the penalty of death?</p>\n<p id=\"b1626-26\">Tr.T.Vol. Ill at 37-40.</p>\n<p id=\"b1626-27\">We find that this was an adequate statement.</p>\n</footnote>\n<footnote label=\"12\">\n<p id=\"b1627-9\">. On this statutory aggravating factor the trial judge found:</p>\n<p id=\"b1627-16\">The evidence showed that a premeditated design to effect the death of the victim com<page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"1524\">*1524</page-number>menced well in advance of its execution. The defendant with accomplices, schemed for a minimum of two weeks preparing to take the victim\u2019s money, murder him, and dispose of his body. The preliminaries included construction of a sturdy casket by the defendant, the involvement of a six year old child in the crime by keeping her home from school on the appointed day and instructing her to answer the door when the victim knocked and invite him into the residence where he was killed, and scheduling the crime around the first of the month when cash collections from the victim\u2019s business would be greatest.</p>\n<p id=\"b1628-10\">The chief medical examiner for the Fourth Judicial Circuit testified that there were fourteen (14) stab wounds on the victim\u2019s chest and shoulder area, six (6) of which penetrated into the body cavity perforating the lungs and each of these six (6) was potentially fatal. He further testified that the victim\u2019s hands and feet were tied by a single link of wire, that the head showed three injuries which were caused by a blunt instrument, that the back of the victim\u2019s right hand showed another four stab wounds, and there had been partial amputation of the index finger. In the medical examiner\u2019s opinion, the victim was tied and bound with wire before he was stabbed.</p>\n<p id=\"b1628-17\">During the pre-death tortures, the victim begged to be freed and offered money to the defendant. The method by which the victim was murdered reflects a strong determination to kill. This murder was committed in a cold, cruel, atrocious and heinous manner.</p>\n<p id=\"b1628-18\">ORDER OF JUDGMENT AND SENTENCE, June 22, 1977.</p>\n</footnote>\n</opinion>\n</casebody>\n",
