Merchants National </em>Bank, 670 F.2d 548 (5th Cir.1982). In the prior case the Merchants Bank insisted it was only a collecting bank, and it was held to be that because its depositor did not demand or direct Merchants to pay the instrument. The mill manager for Southern Cotton Oil Co. prepared the draft on its customer and the draft was forwarded, without any acceptance by customer, to customer\u2019s bank. In our case the customer of Covington Bank signed the draft and directed it \u201cto\u201d the Covington Bank, giving the number of customer\u2019s account in that Bank. That made Covington Bank a drawee and payor bank. The case turns not so much on whether the draft was addressed both to Cattle Co. and the bank, but upon whether Cattle Co. demanded its Bank pay the item.</p>\n<p id=\"b1119-11\">The Petition for Rehearing is DENIED and no member of this panel nor Judge in regular active service on the Court having requested that the Court be polled on rehearing en banc, (Federal Rules of Appellate Procedure and Local Rule 35) the Suggestion for Rehearing En Banc is DENIED.</p>\n</opinion>\n</casebody>\n",
