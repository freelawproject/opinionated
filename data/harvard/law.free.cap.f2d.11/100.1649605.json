St. Ann. Supp. 1919, \u00a7 6287g); and that the second count, which is drawn under the Narcotic Drug Act of 1922 (Comp. St. Ann. Supp. 1923, \u00a7 8800 et s'eq.), is fatally defective in that it does not advise defendant what offense he is charged with.</p>\n<p id=\"b129-7\">Upon the authority of our decisions in Wong Lung Sing v. United States (C. C. A.) 3 F.(2d) 780, and Lee Tung v. United States (C. C. A.) 7 F.(2d) 111, we hold both counts sufficient.</p>\n<p id=\"b129-9\">There is no merit in the assignment that the counts were improperly joined in the indictment. The crimes charged were of the same class, and under section 1024 of the Revised Statutes (Comp. St. \u00a7 1690) joinder in one indictment in separate counts was proper. Perez v. United States (C. C. A.) 10 F.(2d) 352, Feb. 8, 1926,</p>\n<p id=\"b129-10\">It is contended that the court erred in overruling a motion for the exclusion of certain evidence. The bill of exceptions shows that when the ease was called for trial the defendant filed \u201ca motion for the exclusion of certain evidence on the ground that the evidence had been obtained contrary to defendant\u2019s rights under the Fourth and Fifth Amendments to the Constitution.\u201d What the contents of the motion were, or what was the nature of the evidence or facts upon wMeh the motion was based, does not appear in the bill of exceptions.</p>\n<p id=\"b129-12\">During the examination of a witness for the government, the court overruled an objection to the introduction of a package of morpMne that was taken from defendant\u2019s pocket when he was arrested. Exception was preserved. The objection was based upon the ground that defendant\u2019s constitutional rights were invaded, in that no crime was committed in the presence of the officers and that no search warrant had been issued. But as the fact showed that before the arrest of the defendant the officers had reasonable ground to believe that he had violated the Narcotic Drug Act and committed a felony in so doing, the arrest and search were lawful. Cline v. United States (C. C. A. Nov. 1925) 9 F.(2d) 621.</p>\n<p id=\"b129-13\">Defendant argues that the evidence was insufficient to justify the verdict. Stated in briefest way, there was testimony that a marked $20 bill was given to an informer who purchased morpMne from the defendant Foster; that defendant was arrested and a bindle of morphine was found in his vest pocket; that immediately upon Ms arrest he dropped two bindles of cocaine on the sidewalk; that afterwards he admitted that he had received the $20 bill and that he had given it to Ida Higgins, who was jointly indicted with defendant. Defendant testified in his own behalf but failed to rebut the statutory presumption that possession of the drugs was a violation of the act under which the first count was drawn (Act Dee. 17, 1914, 38 St. 785, \u00a7 1, 40 St. 1131, 42 St. 299, Comp. St. Ann. Supp. 1923, \u00a7 6287g, and section 8 [Comp. St. \u00a7 6287n]), and also failed to explain his possession of the drugs to the satisfaction of the jury as required by the act under wMeh the second count was drawn (Act Feb. 9, 1909, 35 St. 615, as amended January 17, 1914, 38 St. 275, as amended May 26, 1922, 42 St. 596 [Comp. St. Ann. Supp. 1923, \u00a7 8800 et seq.]).</p>\n<p id=\"b129-14\">We find no error and affirm the judgment.</p>\n</opinion>\n</casebody>\n",
