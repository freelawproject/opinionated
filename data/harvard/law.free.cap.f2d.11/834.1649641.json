The bill contained allegations to the effect that in 1878 appellant adopted the words \u201cPost-Dispatch\u201d as the trade-mark or trade-name of its daily and Sunday newspaper, published at St. Louis, Mo.; that appellant has continuously used that trademark since its adoption; that, on appellant\u2019s application, it was admitted to registration in the United States Patent Office on July 10, 1924; and that appellee, after acquiring control of two newspapers published in Houston, Tex., called, respectively, the \u201cPost,\u201d and the \u201cDispatch,\u201d in August, 1924, combined or consolidated them under the name of the \u201cPost-Dispatch,\u201d or the \u201cHouston Post-Dispatch,\u201d and since that time has published, circulated, and distributed its newspaper under that name.</p>\n<p id=\"b863-11\">Evidence adduced showed the following: In the year 1878, Joseph Pulitzer, through whom appellant holds, acquired control of two daily newspapers in St. Louis, one called the \u201cPost\u201d and the other the \u201cDispatch.\u201d Soon after those two papers were consolidated in December, 1878, the name \u201cPost-Dispatch\u201d was given to the consolidated paper. Since long prior to 1878 the words \u201cPost\u201d and \u201cDispatch\u201d have been in common use throughout the English-speaking world as names for newspapers; many papers having different owners being designated by each of those names. At the time of the trial of this ease approximately one out of every 14 daily newspapers sold in the United States was called the \u201cPost\u201d or the \u201cDispatch,\u201d or had a name of which one of those words is a part.</p>\n<p id=\"b863-13\">Since long prior to 1878 it has been a common practice throughout the United States for a newspaper formed by the consolidation of two papers to be given a name consisting of the names of the former papers separated by a hyphen, as the \u201cPost-Dispatch,\u201d the \u201cGlobe-Democrat,\u201d the \u201cCourier-Journal,\u201d the \u201cTimes-Pieayune,\u201d etc. Such names have come to -signify newspapers which are successors of two or more publications which have been merged into one. Since 1897 a weekly newspaper called the \u201cDardanelle Post-Dispatch\u201d has been continuously published at Dardanelle, Ark., its circulation being mostly in Yell county, Ark., some copies of it going to subscribers and exchanges in other States. For several years prior to the institution of this suit three other newspapers having the name \u201cPost-Dispatch\u201d have been continuously published in Pennsylvania, Colorado, and North Carolina, respectively.</p>\n<p id=\"b863-14\">Appellant\u2019s paper, styled at the top of each page \u201cSt. Louis Post-Dispatch,\u201d is essentially different in type, get-up, and general appearance from appellee\u2019s paper, which is called the Houston Post-Dispatch. The Sunday edition of the St. Louis Post-Dispatch is printed several days prior to its date of issue. The Sunday editions of each of those papers were sold at a number of newsstands in the territory in which the Houston Post-Dispatch circulates. Frequently customers asked for the Post-Dispatch, without indicating whether the paper desired was the St. Louis Post-Dispatch or the Houston Post-Dispatch, and, to avoid a mistake, the dealer asked which paper was wanted. No evidence adduced tended to prove that any one bought appellee\u2019s paper when he intended to get appellant\u2019s. The circulation of the week-day issues of the St. Louis Post-Dispatch in any territory reached by the Houston PostiDispateh is negligible.</p>\n<p id=\"b863-15\">When the appellant adopted for its newspaper the name \u201cPost-Dispatch,\u201d and before and since that time, that name indi<page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"836\">*836</page-number>(iated a newspaper which was the result of the combination or consolidation of two previously existing newspapers, one called the \u201cPost\u201d and the other the \u201cDispatch,\u201d but did not by itself indicate what newspapers called, respectively, the \u201cPost\u201d and the \u201cDispatch,\u201d were consolidated, or the ownership of the paper resulting from the consolidation. The name was and is so far descriptive that its adoption is to be regarded as having been for a purpose other than a reference to or indication of the origin or ownership of the newspaper to which it was given. It was settled long prior to the Trade-Mark Act of February 20, 1905 (33 Stat. 728 [Comp. St. \u00a7 9485 et seq.]), that one is not entitled to the exclusive use of a trade-mark consisting merely of words which are descriptive of the qualities or characteristics of an article of trade. Columbia Mill Co. v. Alcorn, 14 S. Ct. 151,150 U. S. 460, 37 L. Ed. 1144; United Drug Co. v. Rectanus, 39 S. Ct. 48, 248 U. S. 90, 63 L. Ed. 141; Warner &amp; Co. v. Lilly &amp; Co., 44 S. Ct. 615, 265 U. S. 526, 68 L. Ed. 1161; Searle &amp; Hereth Co. v. Warner, 112 F. 674, 50 C. C. A. 321.</p>\n<p id=\"b864-5\">Under section 5 of the just-mentioned act (Comp. St. \u00a7 9490), the fact that a word, when it was first used to designate an article, was descriptive of it, or indicative of its character or qualities, does not prevent the registration of that word as a trade-mark, if, in foreign or interstate commerce, it was in actual and exclusive use as a trade-mark of the applicant or his predecessors in title for 10 years next preceding February 20, 1905. That provision evidences the intention of Congress to recognize such exclusive use for the period mentioned as a sufficient assurance that the word had acquired a secondary meaning as the designation of the origin or ownership of the goods to which it was affixed. Thaddeus Davids Co. v. Davids, 34 S. Ct. 648, 233 U. S. 461, 470, 58 L. Ed. 1046, Ann. Cas. 1915B, 322. Appellant did not have exclusive use in interstate or foreign commerce of the name \u201cPost-Dispatch\u201d for a newspaper for 10 years next preceding February 20, 1905, nor at any time subsequent to that date and prior to the bringing of this suit. A prior exclusive use for the period mentioned was a prerequisite to an effective registration as a trade-mark of a name or word which by itself at the time of its adoption described or meant a newspaper without indicating whose newspaper it was. The claim to relief on the ground of trade-mark infringement was not sustainable, because appellant failed to prove a stat\u00a9 of facts entitling it to the exclusive use of the words \u201cPost-Dispatch\u201d as the designation of a newspaper.</p>\n<p id=\"b864-7\"> The evidence adduced did not warrant the granting of relief on the ground of unfair competition. So far as appears, appellee did not intend or attempt to palm off its paper as that of the appellant, and such deception was not a natural and probable result of its conduct. The two papers are readily distinguishable, as they do not resemble each other in type, get-up or general appearance. The evidence adduced failed to prove wrongful conduct on the part of the appellee, or actual or probable deception of ordinary buyers of newspapers, having the effect of bringing about purchases of appellee\u2019s paper by persons desiring appellant\u2019s. Relief on the ground of unfair competition cannot properly be awarded, in the absence of proof of wrongful conduct and at least probable substantial injury therefrom to the business of the complaining party.</p>\n<p id=\"b864-8\">The decree is affirmed.</p>\n</opinion>\n</casebody>\n",
