We are of opinion that a preponderance of the evidence shows that an agent of the Shipping Board employed the towboat company to do the work, and did not authorize it to act for the Shipping Board in making a contract with appellant.</p>\n<p id=\"b1047-42\">The decree is affirmed.</p>\n</opinion>\n</casebody>\n",
