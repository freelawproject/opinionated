He assigns error to the overruling of a plea in abatement, the overruling of a .demurrer, and the overruling of a motion in arrest of judgment. No other errors are assigned.</p>\n<p id=\"b634-33\">The plea in abatement was on the ground that the foreman of the grand jury returning the indictment was vice president of a national bank, and hence was a United States official, and ineligible to serve as a juror under the laws of Florida. Conceding that the qualifications of jurors in federal courts are <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"607\">*607</page-number>measured by the laws of the states wherein they sit, and that United States officials are ineligible in Florida, to say that an officer of a national bank is a United States official, within the meaning of the law, is a reduetio ad absurdum.</p>\n<p id=\"b635-5\">The other assignments are equally without merit.</p>\n<p id=\"b635-6\">Affirmed.</p>\n</opinion>\n</casebody>\n",
