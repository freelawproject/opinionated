Shubert and William D. Tatlow, and announced ready for trial, and also appeared the defendant by his attorneys, Shirk, Danner <em>&amp; </em>Fowler, and announced ready for trial.</p>\n<p id=\"b388-13\">\u201cIt appearing to the court that in law case No. 2441 the contract is admitted and the only issues for determination in the ease are in equity as to the cancellation of the contract, but, inasmuch as the case had been assigned on the law docket, and the jury being present, the court at the request of the defendant, Edward R. Wilson, submitted to the jury the equitable issues in the case as advisory only to the court.</p>\n<p id=\"b388-14\">\u201cThereupon there was duly impaneled a jury of twelve good and lawful jurors, who being duly sworn and qualified to try the issues thus submitted to them and a true deliverance make between the plaintiff and defendant according to the law and the evidence; whereupon the jury was excused under proper instructions to return into court on the 11th day of June, 1924.</p>\n<p id=\"b388-15\">\u201cWhereupon, the jury having returned to the court and heard the evidence offered by the defendant in opposition to the contract, and the evidence offered by the plaintiff in support of the contract, was again excused and permitted to separate under the instructions of the court until Thursday morning, June 12, 1924, at 9 o\u2019clock a. m., and thereupon, after having heard the arguments of the respective counsel and being duly charged by the court, the jury retired in the custody of the bailiff to consider their verdict, and, after having deliberated thereon, returned into court with their verdict on Friday, the 13th of June, 1924, wherein they found that said contract should be canceled and set aside.</p>\n<p id=\"b388-16\">\u201cWhereupon the plaintiff, Clement A. Clement, by his attorney, filed in open court a motion to petition the court to disregard the verdict of the jury and to find the issues -in the case in favor of the plaintiff sustaining the validity of said contract, which motion the court then and there overruled, and confirmed and adopted the verdict of the jury. To the action of the court in so doing, the said Clement A. Clement then and there duly and properly objected and excepted thereto, and still so objects and excepts thereto.</p>\n<p id=\"b388-17\">\u201cIt is therefore ordered, considered, adjudged, and decreed that the contract by and between the said plaintiff, Clement A. Clement, and the defendant Edward R. Wil<page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"361\">*361</page-number>son be and. is hereby canceled, annulled, and set aside, and it is further ordered, considered, and adjudged that the plaintiff, Clement A. Clement, is not entitled to recover in his said action on said contract, but the said Edward R. Wilson is hereby permitted to go hence without day.</p>\n<p id=\"b389-5\">\u201cIt is further ordered, adjudged, and decreed that the said Edward R. Wilson is not entitled to recover the sum of <em>$5,500 </em>or any other sum, on his said cross-petition or cross-bill, but the said Clement A. Clement is permitted to go hence without day on said cross-bill, except the payment of all costs in the suit.</p>\n<p id=\"b389-6\">\u201cIt is further ordered, adjudged, and decreed that the plaintiff, Edward R. Wilson, have and recover of and frdm the said Clement A. Clement all costs properly taxed in this case and that execution may be issued therefor.\u201d</p>\n<p id=\"b389-7\">In his brief, counsel for plaintiff says:</p>\n<p id=\"b389-8\">\u201cThis case, while begun as an action at law, was converted into an action in equity under the Act of Congress of March 3, 1915 (38 St. at L. 956). This fact is affirmatively shown in the judgment, as well as in the certification of the evidence. Both parties tried the case on this theory, and, under the elementary rules governing appellate procedure, they are bound hereby. Baker v. Kaiser, 126 F. 317, 61 C. C. A. 303 (C. C. A. 8th Cir.). But even if it should have been tried as an action at law, it was well tried as such, with the exception of the result, and, as the question for decision is whether there was any evidence to support the decree or to carry the case to the jury if it was at law, this question is open, and properly here for decision, under the Act of September 6, 1916 (39 St. at L. 727).\u201d</p>\n<p id=\"b389-9\">Therefore the only question is whether there was any evidence (a) to support the decree, or (b) to carry the ease to the jury if it was at law.</p>\n<p id=\"b389-10\">The cross-bill alleged false representations made by plaintiff, which induced defendant to enter into the contract. Plaintiff's reply denied these allegations.</p>\n<p id=\"b389-11\">Negotiations between the parties were begun by plaintiff writing to defendant the following letter under date of April 15,1922:</p>\n<p id=\"b389-12\">\u201cMr. Edward R.

E: Rose, has requested me to send you a report on the lands in Colombia on which I took options to purchase, and I am sending this with accompanying map with the tracts marked.</p>\n<p id=\"b389-13\">\u201cI spent nearly a year in Colombia, and took with me a man of rather high rank in that country, through whom I was able to get these contracts, as the valuable lands there are owned by a well-to-do class of people who are not anxious to transact business of any character. These options must be renewed in July for another year, and I have already made the arrangements for this by cable and find the owners will agree to extend upon payment of $10,000 or notification from a bank here that their draft for this amount will be honored if attached to the proper legal extensions of the contract. The total amount of my investment in obtaining these options, traveling, etc., is $10,000 to date or I might say the rock bottom to put this deal in force covering everything is $20,000.</p>\n<p id=\"b389-14\">\u201cMy proposition on this is that you will arrange for the payment of this $10,000 draft from Colombia for the renewals for one year from July, 1922, and reimburse me the $10,000 I have spent in the trip to Colombia, for which I am to assign you a half interest in the whole deal, including the three options we are particularly dealing on and other contracts I have there which are to come up later. This money will be handled by you, and the renewal money paid on presentation of the draft with the extensions in good shape at a bank in the States which will be-some time in July, the other ten thousand covering my investment will be paid to me when the extensions have been found satisfactory and as they should be. We will then own the contracts jointly for the negotiation of such business as you may recommend.</p>\n<p id=\"b389-15\">\u201cThe amount of my expenses represent the actual money I have paid on the trip and everything incident to same, including all the expenses of carrying Manuel A. Montoya and wife from New York to Colombia and their upkeep all the time I was there.</p>\n<p id=\"b389-16\">\u201cAs to the renewals, there will be no question about making the extension, as I have arranged this with my lawyer in Bogota, and have his cable and letters that assure me this can be done if the money is forthcoming on their draft.</p>\n<p id=\"b389-17\">\u201cOwing to the amount of time required in communication with Colombia, I would like to have you let me know from New York on this, so I can order the paper sent on if your parties will be interested and I can meet you to personally go into all the details that are difficult to include in a letter.</p>\n<p id=\"b389-18\">\u201cYours very truly, C. A. Clement.\u201d</p>\n<p id=\"b390-3\"><page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"362\">*362</page-number>On May 6, 1922, plaintiff sent to defendant the following telegram:</p>\n<p id=\"b390-4\">\u201cReceived cablegram today from my lawyers and landowners in Colombia stating they will renew options as asked in my former cable March first stop on account of other parties trying to get these lands have had difficult time to get my people to renew for the ten thousand dollars offered them, but this relieves the worry of the situation stop this requires that we assure them of five thousand dollars immediately balance to be paid later stop can we notify them this five thousand dollars will be paid upon delivery of the renewal paper at banks in United States.\u201d</p>\n<p id=\"b390-5\">On the same day, plaintiff wrote to the defendant the following letter:</p>\n<p id=\"b390-6\">\u201cMr. Edward R. Wilson, Oklahoma City, Oklahoma \u2014 Dear Sir: I sent you a wire this morning after receiving a cable from my lawyers and landowners in Colombia; this will advise you of the situation to date and may be of use in your business east. This matter of renewal is vital to the success of our project as the time of the present options is entirely too short to do anything and by sending a man there, to secure extensions, the price would be out of reason, knowing the way those people trade. It is an easier matter to transact this by cable, and I am relieved to learn the terms have been finally agreed by all parties concerned for tracts ABC.</p>\n<p id=\"b390-7\">\u201cMy offer to them has been standing for several months, but they have written and cabled for an increase in same as several parties from oil companies have been after them to take over these options at their expiration; in order to secure the inside favor in this matter I cabled money to my lawyer on my own account that he could use to rather soften up the feelings of these owners and turn the business to me.</p>\n<p id=\"b390-8\">\u201cI do not wish to rush this matter unduly, and my purpose in sending you the wire was not so, but I want you to keep posted on the matter fully and to realize we now have these properties at our disposal and the assurance of another year to July, 1923, if we elect to order the document out covering the renewals. This will cost the $10,000, but we can start the deal by assuring them of the deposit of the money in bank here, if you have made arrangements to take over this proposition and can assure me of the half of the amount ($5,000) I will put up the rest and have the bank here cable their bank in Bogota that the money will be paid upon delivery of the papers. It will take a month or more for the papers to come as I have to send my lawyer a special power of attorney to act in this for me and it will require two weeks to prepare this as it has to be signed by six different officials before being sent, including the Secretary of State of the United States and the Minister of the Colombia Legation at Washington, at present the document is in the hands of the Secretary of State of Texas for authentication of the signature of the local circuit judge.</p>\n<p id=\"b390-10\">\u201cAwaiting your further advice in the matter and with kindest regards,</p>\n<p id=\"b390-11\">\u201cVery truly yours, Clement A. Clement.\u201d</p>\n<p id=\"b390-12\">In his testimony, plaintiff stated that $6,-000 had been paid for the renewal of the options. Defendant testified that he never knew that the renewals were obtained for less than $10,000 until after he had paid the sums of $4,000, $1,000, and $500, and that, when he learned the actual cost of the renewals, he refused to make any other payments to the plaintiff. The court instructed the jury that the burden of proof was on the defendant. The court said further:</p>\n<p id=\"b390-13\">. \u201cThe law properly holds <em>&amp; </em>contract to be a solemn and serious affair, and so the rule arises, gentlemen, that, in order to warrant a cancellation of that contract, the evidence must be clear and convincing and not open to any question or serious doubt. The law puts that burden upon the party attacking the contract. Now what must the evidence prove, gentlemen, to upset the contract; that is, to the extent I have stated? What are the facts that the defendant must establish by clear, cogent showing to your satisfaction? They are as follows:</p>\n<p id=\"b390-14\">\u201cFirst. That the plaintiff, Clement, made the misrepresentations before the contract was executed that the cost of these renewals would be $10,000.</p>\n<p id=\"b390-15\">\u201cSecond. That such representation was false in fact, or, in other words, .that the cost would not be $10,000, but a substantially less sum.</p>\n<p id=\"b390-16\">\u201cThird. That such misrepresentation was made by Clement when he knew it was false, and not a mere expression of opinion on the subject.</p>\n<p id=\"b390-17\">\u201cFourth. That the plaintiff, Clement, made the representations with the intention they should be acted upon by the defendant, Wilson, in signing up the contract.</p>\n<p id=\"b390-18\">\u201cFinally, that it was a material representation that was one, at least, of the in-<page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"363\">*363</page-number>during causes for the execution of the contract by the defendant, Wilson.\u201d</p>\n<p id=\"b391-5\">The jury was fully warranted in finding from the testimony that plaintiff made false representations. The chancellor was warranted in accepting the verdict. Doss v. Tyack, 14 How. 297, 312, 14 L. Ed. 428.</p>\n<p id=\"b391-6\">The plaintiff contends that the decree was inconsistent. That may be true. But the inconsistency lies in the fact that the verdict was not followed to its logical conclusion in the rendition of a judgment against plaintiff for defendant for the amount paid by him under the contract. But the plaintiff cannot complain that such judgment was not rendered.</p>\n<p id=\"b391-7\">Therefore the decree is affirmed.</p>\n</opinion>\n</casebody>\n",
