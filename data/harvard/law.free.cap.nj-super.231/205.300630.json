The Township appeals.</p>\n<p id=\"b237-13\">I.</p>\n<p id=\"b237-14\">Galvao, a mechanic employed by the Township and a member of the Union, pleaded guilty to two counts of possession of methamphetamine with intent to distribute. <em>N.J.S.A. </em>24:21-19a(1); <em>N.J.S.A. </em>24:21-19b(3) (repealed by <em>L. </em>1987, c. 106, \u00a7 25). He was sentenced to concurrent two-year probationary terms <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"208\">*208</page-number>with special conditions that he enter and complete an out-patient drug treatment program.</p>\n<p id=\"b238-4\">Just before sentence was imposed, the Township dismissed Galvao, apparently relying on Township Ordinance 3-3.3, which lists among \u201ccauses for removal\u201d the \u201ccommission of a criminal act\u201d and \u201cconduct unbecoming a public employee.\u201d The Union promptly filed a grievance, which led to the arbitration. By decision issued December 81, 1987, the arbitrator held that Galvao\u2019s dismissal was without \u201cjust cause\u201d within the meaning of Article III of the collective bargaining agreement between the Union and the Township. He directed that Galvao \u201cis to be reinstated to his former position forthwith, but without any back pay or benefits.\u201d</p>\n<p id=\"b238-5\">The record does not indicate that any reference was made to <em>N.J.S.A. </em>2C:51-2 either before or at the arbitration. On February 4, 1988, however, the Township business administrator advised Galvao that \u201ca judgment of conviction for a third-degree offense under New Jersey Statute 2C:51-2 serves as an automatic basis for forfeiture of public office, position or employment,\u201d that the Monmouth County Prosecutor advised that \u201cyour conviction ... is of a nature which compares to a third-degree offense\u201d and accordingly that \u201cyou are deemed to have forfeited your employment as ... of this date.\u201d The Union then filed this action.</p>\n<p id=\"b238-6\">II.</p>\n<p id=\"b238-7\">The core question presented in the trial court and here is whether Galvao\u2019s convictions trigger the mandatory forfeiture of employment provided by <em>N.J.S.A. </em>2C:51-2a(1):</p>\n<blockquote id=\"b238-8\">A person holding any public office, position, or employment, elective or appointive, under the government of this State or any agency or political subdivision thereof, who is convicted of an offense shall forfeit such office or position if: (1) He is convicted under the laws of this State of an offense involving dishonesty or of \u00e1 crime of the third degree or above or under the laws of another state or of the United- States of an offense or a crime which, if committed in this State, would be such an offense or crime.</blockquote>\n<p id=\"b239-4\"><page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"209\">*209</page-number>The trial judge held that Galvao was not convicted of \u201ca crime of the third degree or above\u201d because his offenses, like other Title 24 crimes, are ungraded. We find that reading of the forfeiture statute too narrow.</p>\n<p id=\"b239-5\">Each of Galvao\u2019s offenses exposed Mm to a custodial sentence of up to five years, the same maximum sentence authorized for a third degree offense under Title 2G. <em>N.J.S.A. </em>24:21-19b(8); <em>N.J.S.A. </em>2C:48\u201c6a(3). Galvao\u2019s offenses were characterized as high misdemeanors, which Title 2C equates to third degree crimes for sentencing purposes. <em>N.J.S.A. 24:21-</em>19b(3); <em>N.J.S.A. </em>2C:1-4e; <em>N.J.S.A. </em>2C:43-lb. We also note that upon the 1987 transfer of the offense into Title 2C, the legislature made simple possession of less than one ounce of methamphetamine a third degree crime. <em>N.J.S.A. </em>2C:35-5a(1); <em>N.J.S.A. </em>2C:35-5b(9). Although ungraded, Galvao\u2019s offenses are thus in all respects the equivalent of third degree crimes.</p>\n<p id=\"b239-6\"> In finding that Galvao\u2019s convictions did not activate the forfeiture provision, the trial judge relied largely on <em>N.J.S. A. </em>2C:43-1(b) as it existed before the adoption of <em>L. </em>1987, <em>e. </em>106, \u00a7 8:</p>\n<blockquote id=\"b239-7\">Notwithstanding any other provision of law, a crime defined by any statute of this State other than this code and designated as a high misdemeanor shall constitute for the purpose of sentence a crime of the third degree. Except as provided in sections 2C:1-4c and 2C:1-5b and notwithstanding any other provision of law, a crime defined by any statute of this State other than this code and designated as a misdemeanor shall constitute for the purpose of sentence a crime of the fourth degree. The provisions of this subsection shall not, however, apply to the sentences authorized by the \u201cNew Jersey Controlled Dangerous Substances Act,\u201d P.L. 1970, c. 226 (C. 24:21-1 through 45), which shall be continued in effect.</blockquote>\n<p id=\"b239-8\">Based upon the final sentence of that section, as explicated in <em>State v. Sobel, </em>188 <em>N.J.Super. </em>478 (App.Div.1982), the judge concluded that <em>N.J.S.A. </em>2C:51-2 was inapplicable because sentencing provisions of the Code which are applicable solely to degree-classified offenses are inapplicable to Title 24 offenses.</p>\n<p id=\"b239-9\">That conclusion misperceives the nature of the forfeiture sanction. Forfeiture is not a sentencing disposition, but a civil penalty which is a collateral consequence of conviction. <em>State </em><page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"210\">*210</page-number><em>v. Heitzman, </em>107 <em>N.J. </em>603, 604 (1987). <em>N.J.S.A. </em>2C:43-2b sets forth the kinds of dispositions that a court may make in sentencing under the Code. While a judgment or order imposing a civil penalty may be incorporated in the sentence, it remains a civil remedy. <em>N.J.S.A. </em>2C:43-2d. The limitations imposed in <em>N.J.S.A. </em>2C:43-1(b) are thus inapplicable here.</p>\n<p id=\"b240-4\">The legislature did provide, however, that \u201c[t]he provisions of subtitle 3,\u201d in which <em>N.J.S.A. </em>2C:51-2 appears, \u201care applicable to offenses defined by other statutes but [with certain exceptions not here relevant].\u201d <em>N.J.S.A. </em>2C:1-5b. That provision certainly suggests that the forfeiture section can be applicable to ungraded offenses. To be sure, <em>N.J.S.A. </em>2C:51-2 directs forfeiture upon conviction \u201cof a crime of the third degree or above.\u201d But it also directs that forfeiture shall result from conviction of an equivalent offense, <em>i.e., </em>one \u201cunder the laws of another state or of the United States ... which, if committed in this State, would be [a crime of the third degree or above].\u201d We are satisfied that the legislature thereby intended that forfeiture should follow upon conviction of a crime of the specified level of seriousness, whether that conviction arises under the laws of New Jersey or under the laws of another state or the United States. If a crime committed in another jurisdiction is sufficient to call for forfeiture of New Jersey public employment, surely a comparable ungraded crime in New Jersey was also intended to yield that result. That inference as to the probable legislative intent is particularly powerful in light of the fact that some Title 24 offenses could result in a life sentence. <em>N.J.S.A. </em>24:21-19b(2) (repealed by <em>L. </em>1987, <em>c. </em>106, \u00a7 25). Moreover, the fact that Galvao\u2019s crimes would now be third degree offenses plainly subject to <em>N.J.S.A. </em>2C:51-2 further confirms the legislative intent. <em>See Heitzman, </em>107 <em>N.J. </em>at 605 (O\u2019Hern and Stein, JJ., concurring).</p>\n<p id=\"b240-5\">III.</p>\n<p id=\"b240-6\">We conclude, therefore, that Galvao\u2019s convictions under <em>N.J.S.A. </em>24:21-19a(1) and 19b(3), being equivalent to convictions <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"211\">*211</page-number>of third degree crimes, required invocation of the forfeiture provision of <em>N.J.S.A. </em>2C:51-2. The arbitrator could not lawfully contravene the statutory mandate that Galvao\u2019s public employment \u201cshall\u201d be forfeited. <em>Jersey City Ed. Ass\u2019n v. Bd. of Ed., </em>218 <em>N.J.Super. </em>177, 188 (App.Div.1987). We find no merit in the Union\u2019s contention that, since the Township is not barred from rehiring Galvao, an arbitration award ordering his reinstatement does not conflict with public policy. The arbitrator did not purport to order the Township to hire Galvao anew; in any event, the selection of new personnel is a matter of management prerogative. <em>Id. </em>at 187; <em>Teaneck Bd. of Educ. v. Teaneck Teachers Ass\u2019n, </em>94 <em>N.J. </em>9, 16 (1983).</p>\n<p id=\"b241-6\">The judgment is reversed. The matter is remanded to the Chancery Division for entry of judgment vacating the arbitration award.</p>\n</opinion>\n</casebody>\n",
