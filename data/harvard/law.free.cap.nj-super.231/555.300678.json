In the second count the same parties were charged with possession of a weapon, to wit, \u201ca razor knife or piece of glass\u201d with purpose to use it unlawfully against Charles Stewart contrary to the provisions of <em>N.J.S.A. </em>2C:39-4d and <em>N.J.S.A. </em>2C:2-6.<footnotemark>1</footnotemark> After a jury trial defendant was convicted on both counts of the indictment. Michael Prater was found not guilty on all counts while Louis Daniels and Timothy Daniels were found guilty of <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"558\">*558</page-number>the lesser included offense of simple assault on the first count and not guilty on the second count.</p>\n<p id=\"b588-5\">Defendant was sentenced to a term of seven years on count one and to a concurrent three year term on count two. A Violent Crimes Compensation Board Penalty of $50.00 was assessed and defendant was given appropriate credit for time served. Defendant appeals and raises the following issues:</p>\n<blockquote id=\"b588-6\">POINT I: THE TRIAL COURT\u2019S INSTRUCTIONS TO THE JURY ON THE \u201cUNLAWFUL PURPOSE\u201d ELEMENT OF N.J.S.A. 2C:39-4(d) FAILED TO ADEQUATELY CONVEY THE FACT THAT A PERSON\u2019S ORIGINAL PURPOSE OR INTENT IN POSSESSING A WEAPON HAD TO BE UNLAWFUL. (Not Raised Below).</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b588-7\">POINT II: THE TRIAL COURT\u2019S DENIAL OF THE DEFENDANT\u2019S MOTION FOR A MISTRIAL SHOULD BE REVERSED BECAUSE THE IMPROPER ACTIONS OF THE PROSECUTOR CAUSED GREAT PREJUDICE TO THE DEFENDANT, RESULTING IN MANIFEST INJUSTICE.</blockquote>\n<p id=\"b588-8\">We shall address the issues in the order that they were raised by defendant.</p>\n<p id=\"b588-9\"> To convict a person under <em>N.J.S.A. </em>2C:39-4d, a jury must find that: 1) the item possessed was a \u201cweapon\u201d within the meaning of <em>N.J.S.A. </em>2C:39-1(r); 2) the defendant \u201cpossessed\u201d it, which requires knowledge of awareness of his control over the item <em>(N.J.S.A. </em>2C:2-1c); 3) the defendant\u2019s purpose in possessing the weapon was to use it against the person or property of another; and 4) the defendant intended to use the weapon in a manner that was unlawful. <em>State v. Harmon, </em>104 <em>N.J. </em>189, 212 (1986). Defendant contends that the trial judge did not correctly apply the <em>Harmon </em>principles in his instructions to the jury. He argues that the \u201copinion makes meticulously clear the fact that the person\u2019s <em>original </em>intent in possessing the (weapon) must be unlawful.\u201d Defendant relies upon a passage from <em>State v. Mieles, </em>199 <em>N.J.Super </em>29, 41 (App.Div.1985), cert. den. 101 <em>N.J. </em>265 (1985), quoted in <em>Harmon, Id. </em>104 <em>N.J. </em>at 205, in making his argument. The relevant passage is as follows:</p>\n<blockquote id=\"b588-10\">[T]he verdict here may simply have reflected a finding by the jury that while defendant did not originally possess the weapon for unlawful use the difficul<page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"559\">*559</page-number>ties between defendant and Casagrande [the victim] triggered the aggravated assault and armed robbery. There would be no inconsistency in the verdict, for the possession count related to the purpose for which defendant possessed the gun and not how he used it. 199 <em>N.J.Super. </em>at 41.</blockquote>\n<p id=\"b589-6\">The quote from <em>Mieles </em>must be understood in the context of the issues raised on appeal in that case. Mieles\u2019 contention was that his acquittal for possession of a weapon for the unlawful purpose of using it against Casagrande negated an essential element required for his convictions of armed robbery and aggravated assault using the very same weapon, thus requiring reversal of his conviction on those counts. In that factual context we discern that the <em>Mieles </em>court intended only to observe that the jury apparently had insufficient evidence to convict Mieles of possession of a weapon for an unlawful purpose, but the \u201cpurpose\u201d for which <em>Mieles </em>possessed the gun was not a required element of proof to convict him of armed robbery and aggravated assault.</p>\n<p id=\"b589-7\">In <em>Harmon </em>the passage was used simply to point out that possession of the weapon by Mieles standing alone \u201cdid not in and of itself constitute a purpose to commit a substantive crime other than the regulatory offense; nor did the eventual pointing of the weapon (in the jury\u2019s mind) constitute the unlawful purpose of the possession.\u201d 104 <em>N.J. </em>at 205. In our view, the use of the parenthetical phrase \u201cin the jury\u2019s mind\u201d by the Supreme Court illustrates that, although a jury may ultimately find it unpersuasive, the use of the weapon by a defendant may be used by the State as proof of the \u201cunlawful purpose of the possession.\u201d There is nothing in <em>Harmon </em>to suggest that the State must prove, as defendant contends, that \u201cTyrone Daniels\u2019 <em>original </em>purpose in possessing a knife or piece of glass had to be unlawful.\u201d In fact, <em>Harmon </em>suggests otherwise. The Court said:</p>\n<blockquote id=\"b589-8\">The criminal purpose or state of mind must exist at <em>whatever time </em>the State claims that the possessory offense took place. <em>Id. </em>104 <em>N.J. </em>at 210. (emphasis added)</blockquote>\n<p id=\"b590-4\"><page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"560\">*560</page-number>The issue in <em>Harmon </em>did not arise from the original charge to the jury but from a supplemental charge in response to the jury\u2019s request for a clarification resulting from their misunderstanding of the distinction between the purpose to commit an unlawful act and the purpose in pointing a gun at someone. In his supplemental charge the trial judge equated the unlawful act of <em>Harmon\u2019s </em>pointing the gun at the victim with the specific intent requirement of <em>N.J.S.A. </em>2C:39-4d requiring proof that the purpose for the possession was to commit an unlawful act. <em>Id. </em>104 <em>N.J. </em>at 194-195. As the Supreme Court pointed out, the \u201creal issue\u201d was \u201cnot whether the <em>possession </em>was unlawful; the question is whether the <em>purpose </em>of the <em>possession </em>was unlawful.\u201d <em>Id. </em>at 196.</p>\n<p id=\"b590-5\">There is no evidence in the record that Judge Barlow misled the jury by suggesting that, if it found that defendant possessed a weapon and used it against Stewart, the use of the weapon by the defendant, standing alone, would be sufficient to prove he had possessed it for an unlawful purpose. The judge specifically stated that in order for the defendant to be found guilty, the jury had to conclude that the defendant\u2019s purpose in possessing the knife was to use it unlawfully against Stewart. Cf. <em>State v. Martinez, </em>229 <em>N.J.Super. </em>593 (App.Div.1989).</p>\n<p id=\"b590-6\">Moreover, there was sufficient evidence presented from which a jury could conclude that defendant\u2019s purpose for possessing the knife was for an unlawful purpose. Edith Williams testified that she saw defendant pull the razor knife out of his pocket and cut Stewart\u2019s head. Although the weapon was described as something that is used to open cardboard boxes, there was no evidence in this case that the knife was possessed by defendant for that lawful purpose. In fact, defense counsel\u2019s argument to the jury was that defendant was in possession of neither a knife nor a piece of glass. In addition to Ms. William\u2019s direct testimony concerning possession and use of the <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"561\">*561</page-number>knife, there was circumstantial evidence sufficient to establish defendant\u2019s purpose for possessing the knife. Defendant\u2019s brother Timothy testified that on the day before the incident in question Stewart and Louis Daniels had been involved in a card game in which Louis won approximately $500.00. Louis and Stewart apparently left the place where they were playing cards to purchase some beer. Louis took all his money with him. When they did not return, Timothy went looking for them and was told by someone in the neighborhood that Stewart had set Louis up, meaning that Stewart had apparently arranged to have Louis beaten and robbed. Timothy also testified that, on the day of the subject incident, defendant was aware of what had happened between his brother and Stewart. On the basis of that testimony and the absence of any evidence that the knife was in defendant\u2019s possession for a lawful purpose, a jury could determine that the defendant\u2019s purpose in possessing the knife at some point in time was with the specific intent of using it unlawfully against Stewart. As the Supreme Court in <em>Harmon </em>noted: \u201cWe are confident that juries in most cases will have little problem inferring the accused\u2019s subjective state of mind from the circumstances attendant to his possession of a dangerous weapon. See <em>State v. Ingram, </em>supra. 98 <em>N.J. </em>[489] at 499-500 (juries may infer the existence of an essential element of crime from circumstances attendant to conduct); <em>State v. Latimore, </em>197 <em>N.J.Super. </em>197, 211 (App.Div.1984) (inference of unlawful purpose may be drawn from surrounding circumstances).\u201d <em>Id. </em>at 211.</p>\n<p id=\"b591-6\">We have also reviewed the record in detail in light of the second issue raised by the defendant and conclude that it is clearly without merit. <em>R. </em>2:ll-3(e)(2).</p>\n<p id=\"b591-7\">Affirmed.</p>\n<footnote label=\"1\">\n<p id=\"b587-12\">In the original indictment, the second count identified the weapon as a razor knife. The court permitted an amendment to the indictment to add \"or a piece of glass\u201d based upon the statement given to the police by defendant after he was arrested in which he admitted that he had accidentally cut Stewart by hitting him with a glass. The State agreed not to use the statement unless defendant testified. Defendant did not testify.</p>\n</footnote>\n</opinion>\n</casebody>\n",
