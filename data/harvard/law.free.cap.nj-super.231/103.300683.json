The two boys and a third young boy, Chris Hague, were using gasoline to make a fire in a wooded area behind the Murray home. The boys had obtained the gasoline from an unlocked storage shed on the Murray property. Plaintiff was injured when the gasoline ignited. We granted defendant\u2019s motion for leave to appeal an order denying his motion for summary judgment. The issue is whether defendant is protected from suit by the doctrine of parental immunity.</p>\n<p id=\"b135-9\">The current state of the law in New Jersey appears in <em>Foldi v. Jeffries, </em>93 N.J. 533 (1983). There the Court made it clear that the doctrine of parental immunity has been abolished except \u201cin areas involving the exercise of parental authority or the provision of customary child care.\u201d <em>Id. </em>at 546. The Court carved an exception from that exception \u201cin one discrete area of parental authority\u201d where an injury results from \u201cthe absence or inadequacy of a parent\u2019s supervision over his or her children.\u201d <em>Ibid. </em>In such a case, the parent is liable but only if the lack of parental supervision is willful or wanton. <em>Id. </em>at 549.</p>\n<p id=\"b135-10\">In denying defendant\u2019s motion for summary judgment in the present case, the trial judge ruled, on the basis of interrogatory answers and deposition excerpts, that plaintiff\u2019s injury was not the result of the absence or inadequacy of defendant\u2019s supervi<page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"106\">*106</page-number>sion. Inferentially, he concluded that the immunity did not apply because the accident did not involve the exercise of parental authority or the provision of customary child care. The issue to be tried as he saw it was simply whether defendant was negligent:</p>\n<blockquote id=\"b136-4\">... whether the parent under such circumstances should have reasonably foreseen that leaving a can of gasoline unattended given ten year-old boys and their propensity, whether that is negligence now on his part.</blockquote>\n<p id=\"b136-5\">The motion was properly denied, but the judge ruled prematurely that parental immunity was not implicated.</p>\n<p id=\"b136-6\">The first step in applying the <em>Foldi </em>analysis requires the judge to determine what acts or omissions by the parent a fact finder could reasonably find were the proximate cause of the child\u2019s injury. The next step is to determine whether that conduct is protected by parental immunity, i.e., whether it involves the exercise of parental authority or the provision of customary child care. If it does, the next step is to determine whether the conduct constitutes a lack of parental supervision. If it does, the final step is to determine whether a fact finder could reasonably find that the conduct was willful or wanton thereby removing it from the immunity.</p>\n<p id=\"b136-7\">We first examine how the injury occurred in order to determine what acts or omissions by defendant might reasonably have proximately caused plaintiff\u2019s injury. Plaintiff gave the following account of the accident in an interrogatory answer:</p>\n<blockquote id=\"AjK\">Patrick Shimalla usually carried matches and liked to make fires. Before the incident, the three boys collected wood and grass and decided to build a fire on an over-the-road vehicle trail to the rear and to the left of the plaintiffs home slightly into the woods. Patrick Shimalla had the matches to light the fire. There was difficulty starting the fire and the infant plaintiff and Christopher Hague went to a shed on the Murray property which is to the rear of the Murray house, and got some gasoline out of a can and put it into a peanut can and brought it back to the fire they were trying to start. The boys had easy access to the shed in that it was not locked. Finally, the fire got started by dipping grass into the gasoline can and throwing the gasoline and grass onto the fire. Finally, the gas ran out, and the infant plaintiff and Christopher made a second trip to the shed to get more gasoline. Again, the same procedure was repeated. Immediately before the incident, Patrick Shimalla had the gasoline can in his hand, and the gasoline in it caught fire. Patrick then threw the can, <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"107\">*107</page-number>which was aflame, up in the air, in the direction of the infant plaintiff and the flaming gasoline then poured down and on the infant plaintiff which caused his severe burns.</blockquote>\n<p id=\"b137-5\">Patrick Shimalla described the accident in answer to an interrogatory as follows:</p>\n<blockquote id=\"b137-6\">Plaintiff, Keith Murray, was burned by gasoline that exploded from a can he was holding. While Keith Murray was pouring gasoline onto a piece of wood I was holding, Chris Hague touched a smoking stick to the stream of gas that Keith Murray was pouring from the can he was holding.</blockquote>\n<p id=\"b137-7\">Chris Hague<footnotemark>2</footnotemark> gave the following account of the accident in his interrogatory answer:</p>\n<blockquote id=\"b137-8\">Before the accident, Keith Murray, Patrick Shimalla and myself, Chris Hague, were together on Keith Murray\u2019s porch, eating. During that time, I was playing with a lighter. Keith Murray then stated he wanted to make a fire. All three of us began collecting wood and leaves in which to build the fire. The pile of woods and leaves was set on fire when someone threw a match on it. I am not sure who threw the match on the pile. We all continued to place wood and leaves on the fire. Keith Murray then stated we should get some gasoline from his shed. Keith Murray and I went to the shed three (3) times and each time everyone took turns putting some gasoline on the fire. But the third time, the can of gasoline was not returned to the shed, instead it remained within inches from the fire. Before I knew it, a log had rolled off the pile and hit the can of gasoline, and like fluid lighter being sprayed over an open grill, the can caught on fire [and burned plaintiff]____</blockquote>\n<p id=\"b137-9\">Evidence of defendant\u2019s role in causing the accident also appears in plaintiff\u2019s deposition:</p>\n<blockquote id=\"b137-10\">Q Where was the can of gasoline kept in the shed?</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b137-11\">A Right in the front.</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b137-12\">Q Was it on a shelf or on the floor?</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b137-13\">A On the floor.</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b137-14\">Q Was there at that time a lock on the shed?</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b137-15\">A Yeah, but it was unlatched.</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b137-16\">Q For what period of time, and Pm talking as of the time of your accident\u2014 was it unlatched at the time of your accident?</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b137-17\">A Yeah.</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b137-18\">Q For what period of time had there been no locked shed?</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b138-4\"><page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"108\">*108</page-number>A Mostly all the time except when we went outside and went on vacation or something.</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b138-5\">********</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b138-6\">Q Who had the key or keys to that lock on the shed?</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b138-7\">A My father.</blockquote>\n<p id=\"b138-8\">Plaintiff also testified in his deposition about having his father\u2019s permission to fill the gas tank of his all terrain vehicle (ATV) with the gasoline that was stored in the shed:</p>\n<blockquote id=\"b138-9\">Q Whose ATV was that?</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b138-10\">A Mine.</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b138-11\">********</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b138-12\">Q When you needed to have the ATV filled, normally who would fill it? A My father.</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b138-13\">Q Were there times when your father wasn\u2019t around and you filled it yourself?</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b138-14\">A Yes, a couple of times.</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b138-15\">Q Where did you go to get the gasoline?</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b138-16\">A In my shed.</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b138-17\">********</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b138-18\">Q Did your father ever instruct you in how to pour gasoline into your ATV?</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"ASl\">A Yeah, he taught me how to do it, but he said not unless you really need it and unless he\u2019s \u2014 if he\u2019s not around and unless I really need it.</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b138-19\">Q So he told you that if he wasn\u2019t around and you needed to fill up your ATV, then you could do it?</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b138-20\">A Yeah.</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b138-21\">*****#.*#</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b138-22\">Q You were ten years old at the time?</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b138-23\">A Yes.</blockquote>\n<p id=\"b138-24\">From this evidence, a jury could reasonably find that plaintiff\u2019s injury was proximately caused by defendant\u2019s negligence in two distinct though related respects. First, a jury could find that defendant unreasonably exposed children, including plaintiff, to the risk of injury when he stored gasoline, an extremely d\u00e1ngerous substance when misused by children, on the floor of a shed that he left unlocked. Second, a jury could find that defendant unreasonably exposed plaintiff to the risk of injury from the misuse of gasoline by permitting him <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"109\">*109</page-number>access to and the use of gasoline for his ATV without parental supervision.</p>\n<p id=\"b139-6\">After identifying defendant\u2019s acts or omissions that may proximately have caused the accident, the next step is to determine whether that conduct is protected by the doctrine of parental immunity, i.e., whether it involves the exercise of parental authority or the provision of customary child care.</p>\n<p id=\"b139-7\">Storing gasoline on the floor of an unlocked shed does not involve the exercise of parental authority or the provision of customary child care. To be sure, any allegedly negligent act or omission by a parent that causes his child injury may in some sense \u201cinvolve\u201d the exercise of parental authority. However, abolition of the immunity would be of little effect if the immunity were to attach whenever a parent negligently causes his child injury. Where a parent\u2019s alleged negligence does not focus on the child\u2019s upbringing, the fact that in a particular instance a child happens to be injured by a parent\u2019s negligence does not immunize the parent from liability. Storing gasoline in a manner that gives children access to it is not an exercise of parental authority and therefore is not protected by parental immunity.</p>\n<p id=\"b139-8\">On the other hand, if a jury finds that defendant\u2019s only negligence was giving his child permission to use gasoline without supervision to fill his ATV, giving that permission, though negligence, is protected by parental immunity as an exercise of parental authority because it focused on the child\u2019s upbringing. Discussing the reason for retaining the immunity for that kind of parental judgment, <em>Foldi </em>states:</p>\n<blockquote id=\"b139-9\">There is no recognized correct theory on how much freedom a parent should allow his or her children. Some parents believe that a child must be made self-reliant at an early age and accordingly give their children a great deal of independence. To outsiders, such independence may look like indifference or neglect. On the other hand, some parents believe that their children must be vigilantly monitored from infancy through adolescence. To outsiders, such vigilance and concern may appear to shelter the children from the world and to thwart their development. <em>[Id. </em>at 546.]</blockquote>\n<p id=\"b140-3\"><page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"110\">*110</page-number>Even if defendant thereby qualifies for the immunity, however, he would still be liable if his conduct may fairly be characterized as bearing on his supervision of plaintiff and his conduct is found to be willful or wanton. <em>Foldi </em>dealt with a mother who became momentarily preoccupied and literally failed to supervise her two-year-old daughter. The child wandered onto neighbors\u2019 property and was bitten by their dog. However, <em>Foldi </em>envisions parental supervision in a broader sense than keeping one\u2019s child in sight:</p>\n<blockquote id=\"b140-4\">In addition, we can conceive of few accidental injuries a child might sustain that could not have been prevented by closer supervision by his or her parents. Hindsight invariably will expose some slight oversight, some failure to take yet another precaution that somehow contributed to the child\u2019s mishap. <em>[Id. </em>at 547.]</blockquote>\n<p id=\"b140-5\">It is at least as much a failure of supervision to knowingly permit a 10-year-old to be exposed to the known risks of gasoline as it is to inadvertently allow a toddler to wander off and be exposed to unknown risks. We conclude that giving a 10-year-old unsupervised access to gasoline to fill his ATV, constitutes a form of parental supervision that will subject the parent to liability if the finder of fact determines that the conduct was willful or wanton, and a proximate cause of the child\u2019s injury.</p>\n<p id=\"b140-6\">We are not prepared on this record to conclude that plaintiff will be unable to prove that defendant\u2019s conduct was willful or wanton. <em>Foldi </em>describes the concept as an \u201cintermediary position between simple negligence and the intentional infliction of harm,\u201d <em>id. </em>at 549, and endorses the following definition expressed in <em>McLaughlin v. Rova Farms, Inc., </em>56 <em>N.J. </em>288, 305-306 (1970):</p>\n<blockquote id=\"b140-7\">[I]t must appear that the defendant with knowledge of existing conditions, and conscious from such knowledge that injury will likely or probably result from his conduct, and with reckless indifference to the consequences, consciously and intentionally does some wrongful act or omits to discharge some duty which produces the injurious result.</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b140-8\">ft***#*#*</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b140-9\">[Wjillful [or] wanton misconduct signifies something less than an intention to hurt. To establish that condition it is not necessary that the defendant himself recognize his conduct as being extremely dangerous; it is enough that he know, <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"111\">*111</page-number>or has reason to know, of circumstances which would bring home to the realization of the ordinary reasonable man the highly dangerous character of his conduct.</blockquote>\n<p id=\"b141-6\">We note that though belated, during the pendency of this appeal plaintiff gave notice to take defendant\u2019s deposition. In view of plaintiff\u2019s burden to establish that defendant\u2019s conduct was willful or wanton, plaintiff should be permitted to take defendant\u2019s deposition before trial. Defendant may thereafter move for partial summary judgment respecting plaintiff\u2019s parental supervision claim.</p>\n<p id=\"b141-7\">To summarize, if there is evidence at trial that defendant stored gasoline in a manner that made it accessible to children, the jury may consider whether that conduct was negligent and if so whether it proximately caused plaintiff\u2019s injury. If the jury finds that defendant is not liable on that theory of negligence, but there is also evidence at trial that defendant acted willfully and wantonly by permitting plaintiff to use gasoline for his ATV without supervision, the jury may consider whether that conduct was willful and wanton and if so whether it proximately caused plaintiff\u2019s injury.</p>\n<p id=\"b141-8\">The order denying defendant\u2019s motion for summary judgment is affirmed as modified herein and the matter is remanded for trial.</p>\n<footnote label=\"1\">\n<p id=\"b135-11\">The complaint does not explain why the guardian ad litem is entitled to damages as an individual.</p>\n</footnote>\n<footnote label=\"2\">\n<p id=\"b137-19\">At one time Chris Hague and his parents had been third-party defendants in this action. Chris\u2019s parents obtained a summary judgment. As far as we know, Chris is still a party although not named in the caption.</p>\n</footnote>\n</opinion>\n</casebody>\n",
