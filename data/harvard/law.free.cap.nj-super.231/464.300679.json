In a reported opinion at 222 <em>N.J.Super. </em>636 (Law Div.1987), Judge Haines found that defendant was a first offender and sentenced him to a six-month revocation of his driving privileges together with a fine of $250.</p>\n<p id=\"b496-14\">On appeal, defendant claims that his breathalyzer test results should have been suppressed because the breathalyzer utilized by the State Police, a National Draeger, Model 900, has not <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"467\">*467</page-number>been certified pursuant to <em>N.J.A.C. </em>13:51-3.2 as an approved method of breath testing. He also argues that the applicable regulations for testing and certifying methods and instruments for breath testing are void for vagueness. Finally, he contends that the trial court abused its discretion in denying his discovery demand that the State produce \u201crelevant and material\u201d evidence pertaining to the Breathalyzer, Model 900. On its cross-appeal, the State asserts that the trial court erred in not sentencing defendant as a second offender. We now affirm.</p>\n<p id=\"b497-6\">Defendant was arrested in 1985 in North Hanover Township for driving while under the influence. He was transported to the Fort Dix Police Barracks where the State Police administered two breath tests utilizing the Draeger Breathalyzer, Model 900. Defendant stipulated that the results of these tests revealed a blood-alcholol level in excess of 0.10%. <em>See N.J.S.A. </em>39:4-50(a).</p>\n<p id=\"b497-7\">Defendant moved to suppress the breath test results, contending that the State failed to have the Draeger machine tested and certified as required by <em>N.J.A.C. </em>13:51-3.2. At the hearing, it was determined that Draeger had purchased the patent and manufacturing rights to the \u201cbreathalyzer\u201d from Smith &amp; Wesson Corporation, which had acquired the rights from Stephenson Corporation. Defendant initially stipulated that the Draeger machine was identical to the machine manufactured by Smith &amp; Wesson. Because <em>N.J.A.C. </em>13:51-3.5 and <em>N.J.A.C. </em>13:15-3.6 approve the \u201cBreathalyzer, Model 900\u201d as an instrument and method for chemical breath testing, the trial court concluded, based in part on defendant\u2019s stipulation, that independent testing and certification of the Draeger Model 900, were not required \u201cmerely because of a change of manufacturer.\u201d The trial court therefore denied the motion to suppress.</p>\n<p id=\"b497-8\">Defendant moved for reconsideration, arguing that he had \u201cnew evidence\u201d that there were differences between the Draeger and Smith &amp; Wesson machines. He also moved for discovery, demanding that the State produce all records of its <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"468\">*468</page-number>testing and certification of the Smith &amp; Wesson and Stephenson Model 900\u2019s, and of all records of repairs, malfunctions, and \u201cretirements\u201d of Model 900 machines. The trial court denied this request, but ordered the State to produce any schematic drawings of the Draeger machine and further ordered that the breathalyzer utilized to test defendant be made available for inspection by defendant\u2019s expert.</p>\n<p id=\"b498-5\">On the trial date, defendant repeated his principal contention that the State\u2019s failure to retest and recertify the Draeger Model 900 compelled suppression of the breath test results. However, defendant was unable to produce any evidence, expert or otherwise, demonstrating a difference between the Draeger and Smith &amp; Wesson machines. Concluding that defendant failed to rebut the presumptive validity afforded the Attorney General\u2019s actions, the trial court again denied the motion to suppress.</p>\n<p id=\"b498-6\">Defendant thereupon entered a conditional plea of guilty to a violation of <em>N.J.S.A. </em>39:4-50(a). Prior to sentencing, he testified that in 1982 he had entered a guilty plea without counsel to a driving while under the influence charge. He stated that the municipal court did not then advise him of his right to retain counsel and thus he was unaware of that right when he entered the plea. Concluding that defendant had met his burden of proving the absence of counsel at the time of his first conviction, Judge Haines, sitting as a municipal court judge, found that the first conviction could not be considered for sentence enhancement purposes under <em>N.J.S.A. </em>39:4-50(a)(2). <em>See State v. Laurick, supra, </em>222 <em>N.J.Super. </em>at 640.</p>\n<p id=\"b498-7\">Defendant again argues before us that while the Smith &amp; Wesson Breathalyzer, Model 900, may be an approved instrument and method of breath testing, the Model 900 manufactured by Draeger has never been independently tested and approved by the State Police and Attorney General, and thus cannot be considered \u201cvalid\u201d as a breath testing technique.</p>\n<p id=\"b499-5\"><page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"469\">*469</page-number><em>N.J.S.A. </em>39:4-50.3 provides that chemical analysis of a person\u2019s breath, \u201cto be considered valid under the provisions of this act,\u201d must be performed \u201caccording to methods approved by the Attorney General, and by a person certified for this purpose by the Attorney General.\u201d Rules promulgated by the Attorney General regulating chemical breath testing are codified at <em>N.J.A.C. </em>13:51-1.1, <em>et seq. </em>Specifically, <em>N.J.A.C. 1</em>3:51-3.5(a), as amended in 1982, states, in relevant part, that:</p>\n<blockquote id=\"b499-6\">The <em>Breathalyzer, Model 900, </em>is an instrument approved by the Attorney General ... and this subchapter, for the testing of a person\u2019s breath by chemical analysis. [Emphasis supplied].</blockquote>\n<p id=\"b499-7\">The Breathalyzer, Model 900, is also an approved <em>method </em>for performing chemical analysis of a person\u2019s breath. <em>See N.J.A.C. </em>13:51-3.6(a).</p>\n<p id=\"b499-8\">Approval of instruments utilized for breath testing is governed by <em>N.J.A.C. </em>13:51-3.2, which designates the Superintendent of State Police as the official to test the instrument and method for \u201cspecificity, precision and accuracy.\u201d Upon completion of testing, the Superintendent recommends approval to the Attorney General, who, upon review, may certify the instrument or method pursuant to law. <em>N.J.A.C. </em>13:51-3.2(d).</p>\n<p id=\"b499-9\">Defendant notes that Draeger\u2019s acquisition of Smith &amp; Wesson\u2019s patent right to the Model 900 simply protects Draeger from competitors producing the same machine, but does not prohibit Draeger from altering or modifying the instrument and making the Model 900 less reliable. He therefore argues that separate testing and certification of the instrument produced by each manufacturer is required under <em>N.J.A.C. </em>13:51-3.2 to assure the requisite \u201cspecificity, precision and accuracy.\u201d To require less, defendant contends, violates <em>N.J.S.A. </em>39:4-50.3 and his due process rights under the Fourteenth Amendment.</p>\n<p id=\"b499-10\">Defendant\u2019s argument ignores the fact that the regulations certify the \u201cBreathalyzer, Model 900\u201d as an approved instrument and method for breath testing without reference to specific manufacturers of the instrument. The apparent legislative intent of the regulations was to approve a generic instrument <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"470\">*470</page-number>and method for the testing of a person\u2019s breath as developed and perfected by Robert F. Borkenstein, as originally approved by the Attorney General in 1966. <em>See State v. Yerkes, </em>189 <em>N.J.Super. </em>147, 150 (Law Div.1983). The Breathalyzer, Model 900, was the first Borkenstein machine used in New Jersey and approved by the Attorney General. <em>Id. </em>at 151. The clear and unambiguous language of the present regulations, approved in 1982, adopts this instrument and method without reference to a name of the specific manufacturer.</p>\n<p id=\"b500-5\">The legislative history of <em>N.J.A.C. </em>13:51-3.5 and <em>N.J.A.C. </em>13:51-3.6 supports this conclusion. In September 1966, the Attorney General approved as a method of chemical analysis of breath for determining blood-alcohol content \u201c[t]he breathalyzer as developed and perfected by Robert F. Borkenstein.\u201d <em>See State v. Yerkes, supra, </em>189 <em>N.J.Super. </em>at 150. In 1969, <em>N.J.A.C. </em>13:51-21, now repealed, listed \u201capproved methods and instruments\u201d as including \u201c[t]he breathalyzer as invented by Professor Robert Borkenstein____\u201d As published in February 1980, <em>N.J.A.C. </em>13:51-3.5 included the following \u201capproved methods and instruments\u201d:</p>\n<blockquote id=\"b500-7\">(a) The Breathalyzer as invented by Professor Robert Borkenstein[.]</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b500-8\">(b) The Dominator Albreath manufactured by the Stephenson Company!.]</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b500-9\">(c) The Alco-Tector as manufactured by Decatur Electronics!.]</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b500-10\">(d) The Breathalyzer, Model 100, manufactured by Smith &amp; Wesson/General Ordinance Equipment Company.</blockquote>\n<p id=\"b500-11\">In 1982, <em>N.J.A.C. </em>13:51-3.5 was amended as follows:</p>\n<blockquote id=\"b500-12\">Approved instruments for performing chemical analysis of a person's breath</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b500-13\">(a) The Breathalyzer, Model 900!.]</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b500-14\">(b) The Breathalyzer, Model 900A[.]</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b500-15\">(c) The Dominator Albreath[.]</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b500-16\">(d) The Alco-Tector!.]</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b500-17\">(e) The Breathalyzer, Model 1000[.]</blockquote>\n<p id=\"b500-18\">Summarizing reasons for the proposed 1982 amendment, the Attorney General stated:</p>\n<blockquote id=\"b500-19\">The proposed rule deletes the existing text of <em>N.J.A.C. </em>13:51 and replaces it with new language to accomplish necessary revision, up-dating and clarification <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"471\">*471</page-number>of the terms and conditions applicable to ... forms and methods by which the Attorney General certifies chemical breath test equipment and the methods for the use of these devices.</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b501-5\">The new language will also assist the various courts in this State by providing definitions and clearer application of these rules and regulations thus avoiding potential misinterpretation.</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b501-6\">The principal changes in the proposed language include: ... clarification of the approved devices and methods for their use. [14 <em>N.J.R. </em>376 (1982)].</blockquote>\n<p id=\"b501-7\">We view the 1982 amendments deleting reference to manufacturers as reflecting a clear intent on the Attorney General\u2019s part to approve the generic breathalyzer, Model 900, originally invented by Borkenstein. Implicit in the amendments is the Attorney General\u2019s satisfaction that the method of chemical analysis and components of the instrument are reliable and accurate, regardless of which company holds the patent and manufacturing rights. The Law Division in <em>Yerkes, </em>in a different context, so held. The court concluded that although the Model 900A was not expressly approved by the regulations when defendant was arrested and tested, it was essentially the same method of chemical breath testing approved by the Attorney General when he certified \u201cThe Breathalyzer as invented by Professor Robert Borkenstein[.]\u201d <em>See </em>189 <em>N.J.Super. </em>at 151-152.<footnotemark>1</footnotemark></p>\n<p id=\"b501-8\">Further, a long period of consistent construction by an agency of its own regulations is entitled to great weight in ascertaining the meaning or intent of the language used. <em>See N.J. Bldrs. v. Dept. of Environmental Protec., </em>169 <em>N.J.Super. </em>76, 89-90 (App.Div.), certif. den. 81 <em>N.J. </em>402 (1979); <em>In re Plain-</em><page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"472\">*472</page-number><em>field-Union Water Co., </em>57 <em>N.J.Super. </em>158, 177 (App.Div.1959). The State Police have utilized the Draeger instrument since Draeger acquired the patent and manufacturing rights from Smith &amp; Wesson. Pursuant to <em>N.J.A.C. </em>13:51-3.4, the Draeger Model 900 is inspected periodically by a Breath Test Coordinator to assure its specificity, precision and accuracy. The inspection certificate filed after inspection certifies that the instrument inspected was a \u201cBreathalyzer 900,\u201d as approved by the regulations. The fact that the Attorney General has not considered a change in the manufacturer of the Model 900 as a sufficient basis to retest and recertify the machine is persuasive evidence that the State Police and Attorney General have examined the instruments and have found no difference in the Model 900 as manufactured by Draeger since it acquired the rights from Smith &amp; Wesson.</p>\n<p id=\"b502-5\">Moreover, requiring retesting and recertification upon change in manufacturers leads to an absurd result. <em>See State v. Gill, </em>47 <em>N.J. </em>441, 444 (1966). If defendant is correct, retesting and recertification may indeed be required when the manufacturer of the machine merges with another company, or if it changes its trade name or, as the trial court noted, if there are changes in the personnel who manufacture the instrument.</p>\n<p id=\"b502-6\">Finally, a presumption of reasonableness must be afforded the Attorney General\u2019s interpretation of the regulations. <em>See Barone v. D. of Human Serv., Div. of Med. Asst, </em>210 <em>N.J.Super. </em>276, 285 (App.Div.1986), aff\u2019d 107 <em>N.J. </em>355 (1987). Where the Legislature, as here, entrusts an agency with the responsibility of \u201cselecting the means of achieving an articulated statutory policy, the relation or nexus between the remedy and the goal sought to be accomplished is peculiarly a matter for administrative competence.\u201d <em>NJPDES Permit No. NJ 0055247, </em>216 <em>N.J.Super. </em>1, 11 (App.Div.), certif. den. 108 <em>N.J. </em>185 (1987). The burden is on the party who challenges the validity of the action as being arbitrary, or as being contrary to the legislative purpose. <em>Smith v. Ricci, </em>89 <em>N.J. </em>514, 525 app. dis. 459 <em>U.S. </em>962, 103 <em>S.Ct. </em>286, 74 L.Ed.2d 272 (1982).</p>\n<p id=\"b503-5\"><page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"473\">*473</page-number>Here, the trial court gave defendant ample opportunity to demonstrate how the Draeger Breathalyzer, Model 900, was different than the instrument manufactured by Smith &amp; Wesson. Defendant had the schematic of the Model 900 and his expert had the opportunity to inspect the Draeger instrument utilized for defendant\u2019s testing.<footnotemark>2</footnotemark> Neither defendant nor his expert was able to present any evidence that Draeger had altered or modified the Breathalyzer, Model 900 since the time it had acquired the patent and manufacturing rights from Smith &amp; Wesson. We agree with the trial court that, without more, no reasonable inference can be reached that the Draeger instrument was any different than that manufactured by Smith &amp; Wesson.</p>\n<p id=\"b503-6\">We also reject defendant\u2019s contention that the trial court erred in denying his demand for discovery. Defendant requested records of repairs, malfunctions and \u201cretirement\u201d of all Breathalyzer Model 900 instruments, presumably since 1966, as well as records of the testing and certification of the Smith &amp; Wesson and Stephenson Model 900\u2019s. While our system recognizes a defendant\u2019s right to have complete discovery, \u201callowing a defendant to forage for evidence without a reasonable basis is not an ingredient of either due process or fundamental fairness in the administration of the criminal laws.\u201d <em>State v. R. W., </em>104 <em>N.J. </em>14, 28 (1986). Beyond being unreasonably burdensome and far-reaching, these records were not relevant to the issue before the trial court. <em>See R. </em>3:13-3(a). The records at best were relevant as to the issue of reliability of the Model 900, not whether there were differences in the machine as manufactured <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"474\">*474</page-number>by Draeger and Smith &amp; Wesson.<footnotemark>3</footnotemark> The trial court pressed defendant to show how these records would be relevant to establish differences, and defendant failed to do so. The trial court ordered the relevant schematics be produced and also directed that defendant\u2019s expert be permitted to examine the machine in question. We find no abuse of discretion in the trial court\u2019s denial in the remainder of defendant\u2019s demand.</p>\n<p id=\"b504-5\">Finally, we find no merit to defendant\u2019s contention that the regulations are void for vagueness. \u201cA law is void as a matter of due process if it is so vague that persons \u2018of common intelligence must necessarily guess at its meaning and differ as to its application\u2019.\u201d <em>Town Tobacconist v. Kimmelman, </em>94 <em>N.J. </em>85, 118 (1983), quoting <em>Connally v. General Constr. Co., </em>269 <em>U.S. </em>385, 391, 46 <em>S.Ct. </em>126, 127, 70 <em>L.Ed. </em>322, 328 (1926). <em>N.J.A.C. </em>13:51-3.5 is designed to give law enforcement officers notice of what breath-testing devices have already been approved by the Attorney General. The State Police and other law enforcement officers have had no problem in understanding the scope and intendment of the regulation. <em>N.J.A.C. </em>13:51-3.2 leaves no doubt that the regulation requires <em>new </em>methods and instruments to be tested and certified by the State Police and Attorney General. Defendant\u2019s vagueness argument was therefore properly rejected by the trial court.</p>\n<p id=\"b504-6\">On the State\u2019s cross-appeal, it contends that the trial court erred in sentencing defendant as a first offender.<footnotemark>4</footnotemark> It argues that since defendant did not receive a custodial sentence in 1982, his Sixth Amendment right to counsel was not violated as a result of the municipal court\u2019s failure to advise him of his <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"475\">*475</page-number>right to counsel. <em>See Scott v. Illinois, </em>440 <em>U.S. </em>367, 99 <em>S.Ct. </em>1158, 59 L.Ed.2d 383 (1979); <em>Argersinger v. Hamlin, </em>407 <em>U.S. 25, </em>92 <em>S.Ct. </em>2006, 32 <em>L.Ed.2d </em>530 (1972). It also argues that <em>Rodriguez v. Rosenblatt, et al., </em>58 <em>N.J. </em>281, 295 (1971), which requires a municipal court to assign counsel to indigent defendants in cases involving a \u201cconsequence of magnitude,\u201d does not preclude use of a prior uncounseled conviction where, as here, there is no evidence that defendant was indigent at the time of his 1982 conviction. The State therefore contends that defendant\u2019s 1982 uncounseled conviction may be used for enhancement purposes even if he had not been advised of his right to counsel. We disagree.</p>\n<p id=\"b505-6\">In a plurality opinion in <em>Baldasar v. Illinois, </em>446 <em>U.S. </em>222, 100 <em>S.Ct. </em>1585, 64 <em>L.Ed.2d </em>169, reh. den. 447 <em>U.S. </em>930, 100 <em>S.Ct. </em>3030, 65 <em>L.Ed.2d </em>1125 (1980), five justices, in three concurring opinions, concluded that the Sixth Amendment prohibited the use of a prior uncounseled conviction to enhance defendant\u2019s subsequent conviction from a misdemeanor to a felony. Justice Stewart reasoned that since defendant was sentenced to an increased term of imprisonment <em>\u201conly </em>because\u201d he had been previously convicted without the assistance of counsel, the enhanced sentence violated the rule of <em>Scott v. Illinois, supra, </em>440 <em>U.S. </em>at 373-374, 99 <em>S.Ct. </em>at 1162, 59 <em>L.Ed.2d </em>at 373-74, which adopted actual imprisonment as the line defining the constitutional right to appointment of counsel. <em>Baldasar v. Illinois, supra, </em>446 <em>U.S. </em>at 224, 100 <em>S.Ct. </em>at 1586, 64 <em>L.Ed.2d </em>at 172-173. In his concurring opinion, Justice Marshall reasoned that while the first uncounseled conviction may not have violated <em>Scott, </em>it could not be used for enhancement purposes where the enhanced sentence is imposed as \u201ca direct consequence of that uncounseled conviction[.]\u201d <em>Id. </em>at 227, 100 <em>S.Ct. </em>at 1588, 64 <em>L.Ed.2d </em>at 174.</p>\n<p id=\"b505-7\">In <em>State v. Sweeney, </em>190 <em>N.J.Super. </em>516 (App.Div.1983), we considered whether any of the opinions in <em>Baldasar </em>apply to a defendant convicted as a second offender under <em>N.J.S.A. </em>39:4-<page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"476\">*476</page-number>50, but whose enhanced penalty involved a noncustodial term. We concluded:</p>\n<blockquote id=\"b506-5\">[n]one of the views expressed by the justices precludes using the present defendants\u2019 prior convictions to impose enhanced <em>noncustodial penalties </em>for a second driving under the influence conviction. <em>[Id. </em>at 523; emphasis in original].</blockquote>\n<p id=\"b506-6\">Here defendant faces a custodial term from 2 to 90 days as a second offender under the present statute. <em>See N.J.S.A. </em>39:4\u2014 50(a)(2). However, <em>N.J.S.A. </em>39:4-50(a) affords the trial court the option of permitting a defendant, as a second offender, to serve the term at an Intoxicated Driver Resource Center instead of the county jail. There may at least be a question as to whether the two days of treatment at the center constitutes a \u201ccustodial term.\u201d Thus, <em>Sweeney\u2019s </em>reasoning that no Sixth Amendment right is implicated may still apply.</p>\n<p id=\"b506-7\">However, aside from Sixth Amendment considerations, we agree with Judge Haines that State law bars use of the prior conviction for purposes of imposing an enhanced term under <em>N.J.S.A. </em>39:4-50. Our Supreme Court in <em>Rodriguez v. Rosenblatt, et al., supra, </em>held that:</p>\n<blockquote id=\"b506-8\">... as a matter of simple justice, no indigent defendant should be subjected to a conviction entailing imprisonment in fact or other <em>consequence of magnitude </em>without first having had due and fair opportunity to have counsel assigned without cost. [58 <em>N.J. </em>at 295; emphasis supplied].</blockquote>\n<p id=\"b506-9\">Citing the <em>Rodriguez </em>public policy consideration, we held in <em>Sweeney </em>that \u201cwhere a defendant is in danger of incurring a substantial loss of driving privileges as a result of an alleged motor vehicle violation, he is entitled to counsel.\u201d 190 <em>N.J.Super. </em>at 524. We made no distinction between indigent and non-indigent defendants. <em>See also Beckworth, et al. v. N.J. State Parole Bd., </em>62 <em>N.J. </em>348, 365 certif. den. 63 <em>N.J. </em>583 (1973). Indeed, <em>R. </em>3:27-2 provides that:</p>\n<blockquote id=\"b506-10\"><em>[ejoery person </em>charged with a non-indictable offense shall be advised by the court of his right to retain counsel or, if indigent and constitutionally or otherwise entitled by law to counsel, of his right to have counsel assigned without cost. [Emphasis supplied].</blockquote>\n<p id=\"b506-11\">In our view, a municipal court's failure to adhere to either the public policy pronounced in <em>Rodriguez </em>or the mandate of <em>R. </em><page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"477\">*477</page-number>3:27-2 disqualifies the State\u2019s use of the 1982 uncounseled conviction for enhancement purposes. Without adherence to <em>Rodriguez </em>and <em>R. </em>3:27-2, the prior conviction is not sufficiently reliable to trigger the severe sanctions under the enhancement statute. Defendant\u2019s prior uncounseled conviction does not become \u201cmore reliable merely because [he] has been validly convicted of a subsequent offense.\u201d <em>Baldasar v. Illinois, supra, </em>446 <em>U.S. </em>at 228, 100 <em>S.Ct. </em>at 1588, 64 L.Ed.2d at 175, (Marshall, J., concurring). Our recent opinion in <em>State v. Carey, </em>230 <em>N.J.Super. </em>402 (App.Div.1989) is in accord. As we stated in <em>Carey, </em>\u201c[t]he policy embodied in <em>Rodriguez </em>and <em>R. </em>3:27-2 would have no meaning or impact if our conclusion were otherwise.\u201d <em>Id. </em>at 409.<footnotemark>5</footnotemark></p>\n<p id=\"b507-6\"><em>Sweeney </em>properly places the burden of proving the lack of legal representation at the time of the first conviction upon the defendant. 190 <em>N.J.Super. </em>at 525-526; <em>see also State v. Carey, supra, </em>230 <em>N.J.Super. </em>at 409-10; <em>State v. Regan, </em>209 <em>N.J.Super. </em>596, 606 (App.Div.1986); <em>State v. Bowman, </em>135 <em>N.J.Super. </em>210, 211 (App.Div.1975). Here, there is no question that defendant met that burden by giving uncontradicted testimony under oath that he entered a guilty plea to the 1982 offense without counsel and without being advised of his right to retain counsel as required by <em>R. </em>3:27-2. In fact, the prosecutor conceded at the time of sentencing, in view of defendant\u2019s testimony, that defendant should be sentenced as a first offender.</p>\n<p id=\"b507-7\">We cannot presume, without some contravailing proofs presented by the State, that simply because <em>R. </em>3:27-2 requires the court to advise a defendant of his right to counsel, the municipal judge did so. Nor can we conclude, particularly since <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"478\">*478</page-number>the trial court accepted defendant\u2019s testimony as believable, <em>see State v. Johnson, supra, </em>42 <em>N.J. </em>at 161 that defendant perjured himself in testifying that he did not know of his right to counsel in 1982. We therefore agree with the trial court that the 1982 conviction cannot be used for enhancement purposes.</p>\n<p id=\"b508-5\">We are mindful of the State\u2019s assertion that it may have difficulty producing records of counsel representation in prior convictions. Sound recordings and stenographic records of proceedings in municipal courts are kept for only three years. <em>See R. </em>7:4-5(a). However, the difficulty may be resolved by noting hereafter compliance with <em>R. </em>3:27-2 and <em>Rodriguez </em>in the record of conviction.</p>\n<p id=\"b508-6\">Affirmed.</p>\n<footnote label=\"1\">\n<p id=\"b501-9\">ln <em>Romano v. Kimmelman, </em>96 <em>N.J. </em>66, 72 (1984), the Supreme Court conclusively determined by order that the Breathalyzer, Models 900 and 900A, are scientifically reliable. <em>See also State v. Downie, </em>229 <em>N.J.Super. </em>207 (App.Div.1988), leave to appeal granted 114 <em>N.J. </em>498 (1989). Although the order refers only to the Smith &amp; Wesson model, it also states that \"[t]he results of the administration of the <em>Model 900 </em>can be received in evidence in accordance with the standards under <em>State v. Johnson, </em>42 <em>N.J. </em>146 (1964)[.]\u201d <em>Romano, supra, </em>96 <em>N.J. </em>at 72 [emphasis supplied]. We read the order and opinion as referring to the generic Model 900, and not intending to limit its application to a specific manufacturer.</p>\n</footnote>\n<footnote label=\"2\">\n<p id=\"b503-7\">Pursuant to the trial court\u2019s discovery order, the Attorney General submitted two pamphlets to defendant, one bearing a 1968 Stephenson Corporation copyright and the other being a \u201cBreathalyzer Model 900 Instruction Manual, National Draeger, Inc.,\u201d 1979 edition. The Draeger manual was in fact a Smith &amp; Wesson manual with a National Draeger corporate label affixed. Within the manual were a number of schematic drawings of the Breathalyzer, Model 900. As far as we can determine from the record, no other Draeger schematic is in the possession of the Attorney General.</p>\n</footnote>\n<footnote label=\"3\">\n<p id=\"b504-7\">The records may not have even been relevant as to the issue of reliability in view of the Supreme Court\u2019s holding and order in <em>Romano. </em>96 <em>N.J. </em>at 72.</p>\n</footnote>\n<footnote label=\"4\">\n<p id=\"b504-8\">The State has the right to cross-appeal to seek correction of an illegal sentence. <em>See State v. Sheppard, </em>125 <em>N.J.Super. </em>332, 336 (App.Div.), certif. den. 64 <em>N.J. </em>318 (1973). If defendant was a second offender, the sentence imposed was illegal. <em>See N.J.S.A. </em>39:4-50(a)(2).</p>\n</footnote>\n<footnote label=\"5\">\n<p id=\"b507-8\">In <em>State v. McGrew, </em>127 <em>N.J.Super. </em>327 (App.Div.1974), we affirmed a three-month jail term imposed upon a second offender under <em>N.J.S.A. </em>39:4-50(a) despite the fact that defendant, at the time of his first conviction, was indigent and uncounseled. However, <em>McGrew </em>is distinguishable since there defendant\u2019s first conviction was prior to <em>Rodriguez, see </em>127 <em>N.J.Super. </em>at 329 and we observed \"there is nothing in <em>Rodriguez </em>to suggest an intent that the holding should apply retroactively.\u201d <em>Ibid.</em></p>\n</footnote>\n</opinion>\n</casebody>\n",
