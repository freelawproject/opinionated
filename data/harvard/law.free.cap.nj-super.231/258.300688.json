Defendant is charged with possession of less than 25 grams of marijuana, a disorderly persons offense. <em>N.J.S.A. </em>24:21-20a(4). The marijuana was in plain view on a bureau in his bedroom. The issue is whether shortly before he saw the marijuana, police officer Michael Mathis, the only witness at the suppression hearing, had lawfully arrested defendant pursuant to the Prevention of Domestic Violence Act (the act), <em>N.J.S.A. </em>2C:25-1 <em>et seq., </em>and therefore had the right to accompany defendant to his bedroom.</p>\n<p id=\"b290-11\">Officer Mathis was on patrol in his radio car on Saturday, June' 6, 1987, when at about 2 p.m. he was dispatched to defendant\u2019s home in response to a domestic dispute complaint made by defendant's sister, Dolores. The dispatcher advised Officer Mathis that Dolores had called the police to say that she had a domestic violence restraining order against defendant and \u201cshe felt that her life was being threatened by Rory being inside the house.\u201d</p>\n<p id=\"b290-12\">Acting on Dolores\u2019s complaint, a Superior Court judge on May 28 had issued ex parte a temporary restraining order barring defendant from their home<footnotemark>1</footnotemark> and prohibiting him from <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"261\">*261</page-number>\u201chaving any contact with the plaintiff or harassing plaintiff or plaintiffs relatives in any way..,.\u201d<footnotemark>2</footnotemark></p>\n<p id=\"b291-6\">The order required defendant and his sister to appear for a hearing on June 2. The sheriff officer\u2019s return of service at the foot of a copy of the filed order shows that only Dolores was served. The dispatcher did not tell Officer Mathis, presumably because she did not know, that the court had vacated the temporary restraining order on June 2 because neither party appeared.</p>\n<p id=\"b291-7\">When the officer arrived at defendant\u2019s home,<footnotemark>3</footnotemark> he waited for another officer who also had been dispatched there. Departmental procedures call for dispatching at least two officers to the scene of a domestic dispute because of the potential for sudden violence. Officer Mathis described those procedures in his direct examination:</p>\n<blockquote id=\"b291-8\">Q What is the procedure when you are called to a domestic dispute? A Separate both parties, calm things down, find out the stories, make sure they\u2019re aren\u2019t any cuts, people aren\u2019t beat up and basically find out what\u2019s going on. And if there\u2019s any restraining order on either party, go from there.</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b291-9\">Q What is your responsibility with respect to the individuals involved as far as safety?</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b292-4\"><page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"262\">*262</page-number>A To protect them from being harmed by each other, separate them and also protect ourselves. We have to keep our eyes on them because they can turn on you at any time.</blockquote>\n<p id=\"b292-5\">When the other officer arrived, Officer Mathis left his patrol car and they both walked up the driveway. As they neared the house, the officers \u201cheard two individuals arguing, male and female, two voices as we approached the front door.\u201d Officer Mathis testified that the voices were \u201cloud,\u201d \u201cshouting.\u201d</p>\n<blockquote id=\"b292-6\">Q Describe it besides shouting, if you can?</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b292-7\">A I kept hearing Dolores saying, \u201cI want you out of the house. I want you out of the house.\u201d</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b292-8\">I can\u2019t recall what Rory was saying. He\u2019s hard to understand at times.</blockquote>\n<p id=\"AX1\">After Officer Mathis knocked on the door, Dolores invited him in and \u201cadvised me as we entered that there was a restraining order on Rory and she said she wanted him out of the house at that time.\u201d</p>\n<p id=\"b292-9\">Defendant was standing quietly in the living room in his pajamas. His sister sat down on a couch.</p>\n<blockquote id=\"b292-10\">Q When you entered the house and you saw that Dolores had sat back down to the couch and Rory was calm, were you satisfied that any danger that might have been was suppressed?</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b292-11\">A No.</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b292-12\">Q Why?</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b292-13\">A Dolores actually didn\u2019t \u2014 she sat on the couch but she still kept shouting she wanted Rory out of the house.</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b292-14\">Q She didn\u2019t say anything else?</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b292-15\">A No.</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b292-16\">********</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b292-17\">Q What action did you take after that?</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b292-18\">A I advised Rory that he would have to come back to headquarters with me.</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b292-19\">He asked me if he could get his clothes because he was partially dressed, all he was wearing was pajama bottoms, no shirt, no shoes.</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b292-20\">********</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b292-21\">Q After Dolores Scott requested that her brother be taken out of the house did Rory say anything?</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b292-22\">A No, he was very cooperative, willing to leave.</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b292-23\">Q He offered no resistance?</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b292-24\">A None at all.</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b293-5\"><page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"263\">*263</page-number>Q Did you ask Rory any questions at that time?</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b293-6\">A No, I just told Rory he had to come back to headquarters with me. He requested to get some clothes, comb his hair.</blockquote>\n<p id=\"b293-7\">Officer Mathis followed defendant into his bedroom because department procedure is to follow \u2014 whenever domestic, to follow the individuals around the house for our own protection in case they pick up a gun or knife.</p>\n<p id=\"b293-8\">When he entered the bedroom, Officer Mathis saw the marijuana on defendant\u2019s bureau.</p>\n<p id=\"b293-9\">The officer neither saw nor heard evidence that defendant had been violent. Although not in his report of the incident, he testified that Dolores told him that she feared for the life of her year-old baby if defendant was not removed from the house because he was \u201ckind of crazy.\u201d</p>\n<blockquote id=\"b293-10\">THE COURT: Did she give any indication, \u201ccrazy,\u201d in what way that would make him dangerous?</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b293-11\">THE WITNESS: No, she didn\u2019t.</blockquote>\n<p id=\"b293-12\">The officer testified that before he became a police officer, he had been a dispatcher and that as a dispatcher he \u201cdid send the cars to the house.\u201d</p>\n<blockquote id=\"b293-13\">THE COURT:. Do you have any violence that you heard?</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b293-14\">THE WITNESS: I believe not violence but about eight months prior to this incident, he was \u2014 he pulled his pants down to his next door neighbor, a female. The lady lived next door to him. And grabbed his genitals and waved to the next door lady that lives next door.</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b293-15\">THE COURT: And was there ever any threat of harm to anybody in a physical sense other than their sensitivities?</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b293-16\">THE WITNESS: No, not that I can recall.</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b293-17\">THE COURT: What made you think he was threatening? Was there something about it or was it simply \u2014 you understand. We\u2019re trying to find out simply because there was a restraining order that you felt required his removal or was there, in fact, besides that some actual threat that you felt that he posed through something you saw or something that you had any basis for believing.</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b293-18\">********</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b293-19\">THE WITNESS: Dolores didn\u2019t actually state anything that he physically abused her or threatened her but by the way she was acting and the way she wanted him removed from the house, she felt her life was threatened. She wouldn\u2019t actually come out and say why she felt her life was threatened but just kept saying she felt she was in danger because of her baby. Her baby is only one year old.</blockquote>\n<p id=\"b294-4\"><page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"264\">*264</page-number>When Officer Mathis returned to headquarters with defendant he learned that the order on which he relied in making the arrest had been vacated.</p>\n<blockquote id=\"b294-5\">Q Was there a valid restraining order?</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b294-6\">A There was a restraining order signed by Dolores on Eory at the time.</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b294-7\">I was informed by headquarters they had reason to believe the restraining order was still in effect.</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b294-8\">When we got back to headquarters we looked at it and found out the days had expired for the number of days to go down to court and have it signed by the judge. And they never went to the court to have it signed by the judge, so it actually wasn\u2019t.</blockquote>\n<p id=\"b294-9\">No one asked the officer what he had looked at that made him realize that the order had been vacated. It is not clear from the record whether the dispatcher had a basis, other than Dolores\u2019s assertion, for her statement to Officer Mathis that the temporary restraining order was in effect.</p>\n<p id=\"b294-10\">In <em>State v. Bruzzese, </em>94 <em>N.J. </em>210 (1983), police executed a valid arrest warrant at the defendant\u2019s home. The arresting officers permitted the defendant to go to his bedroom to dress before taking him to police headquarters. When they accompanied him there they saw and seized incriminating evidence that was in plain view. The Court held that the police acted reasonably in accompanying the defendant to his bedroom.</p>\n<blockquote id=\"b294-11\">Accordingly, we rule that once a defendant is placed under <em>lawful arrest, </em>the arresting officer has the right to remain at his side and to follow him wherever he chooses to go. The officer need not posit any special need for the accompaniment <em>so long as the arrest is lawful. </em>The accompaniment is purely a precautionary measure. <em>[Id. </em>at 232. Emphasis supplied.]</blockquote>\n<p id=\"b294-12\">The issue presented in the present case is whether defendant\u2019s warrantless arrest was lawful.</p>\n<p id=\"b294-13\">The trial judge analogized defendant\u2019s arrest to an arrest based on an arresting officer\u2019s erroneous but good faith belief that there is an existing arrest warrant. In such a case the arrest is not lawful even if the officer\u2019s belief was engendered by the statements of other police officers. <em>Whiteley v. Warden of Wyoming Penitentiary, </em>401 <em>U.S. </em>560, 568, 91 <em>S.Ct. </em>1031, 1037, 28 <em>L.Ed.2d </em>306, 313 (1971); <em>State v. Cullars, </em>224 <em>N.J.Super. </em>32, 37-38 (App.Div.1988).</p>\n<p id=\"b295-5\"><page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"265\">*265</page-number>In evaluating the lawfulness of an arrest, the analogy between an arrest warrant and a temporary restraining order issued pursuant to the act is not as apt as it may first appear. To be lawful an arrest must be based upon probable cause to believe that the person arrested had committed or was committing an offense. Where an arrest is based upon a warrant, the evidence of probable cause was perceived by the judge who issued the warrant; if there is no warrant, the arrest is unlawful because there is no probable cause.</p>\n<p id=\"b295-6\">Where exigent circumstances authorize a warrantless arrest, the arrest is based upon the evidence of probable cause that is perceived by the arresting officer. If the officer does not perceive evidence giving him probable cause to believe that the person arrested had committed or was committing a crime, the arrest is unlawful. <em>State v. Cook, </em>47 <em>N.J. </em>402, 414 (1966). A warrantless arrest for a disorderly persons offense is lawful only if the offense was committed in the arresting officer\u2019s presence. <em>Bauer v. Borough of Cliffside Park, </em>225 <em>N.J.Super. </em>38, 46 (App.Div.1988); <em>State in Interest of J.B., Jr., </em>131 <em>N.J.Super. </em>6, 13 (J. &amp; D.R.Ct.1974).</p>\n<p id=\"b295-7\">The question here is not whether at the time of the arrest there was an existing temporary restraining order evidencing probable cause that defendant had once committed an act of domestic violence. Rather, the question is whether the arresting officer had probable cause to believe that defendant had knowingly violated a court order that barred him from the home.</p>\n<p id=\"b295-8\">At the time of this incident, violation of a temporary restraining order issued pursuant to the act was prosecuted as fourth-degree contempt, <em>N.J.S.A. </em>2C:29-9:</p>\n<blockquote id=\"b295-9\">A person is guilty of a crime of the fourth degree if he purposely or knowingly disobeys a judicial order or hinders, obstructs or impedes the effectuation of a judicial order or the exercise of jurisdiction over any person, <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"266\">*266</page-number>thing or controversy by a court, administrative body or investigative entity.<footnotemark>4</footnotemark></blockquote>\n<p id=\"b296-5\">The essential elements of the crime are that a person with a purposeful or knowing culpability, disobeys or hinders the effectuation of a court order.</p>\n<p id=\"b296-6\">Reflecting those elements, the act permits a police officer to make a warrantless arrest if the officer has probable cause to believe that the person arrested had been served with and violated an order issued pursuant to the act. <em>N.J.S.A. </em>2C:25-5 provides:</p>\n<blockquote id=\"b296-7\">a. A law enforcement officer shall arrest a person if a victim exhibits sign of injury caused by an act of domestic violence.</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b296-8\">b. A law enforcement officer may arrest a person:</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b296-9\">(1) When the officer has probable cause to believe that a person has violated, the terms of an order issued pursuant to section 10, 11, 13 or 14 of this act and that service has been effected either in person or by substituted service. The officer may verify, if necessary, the existence of an order with the appropriate law enforcement agency; or</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b296-10\">(2) When there is other probable cause to believe that an act of domestic violence has been committed. [The Legislature added paragraph a. by enacting L.1987, <em>c. </em>356, \u00a7 1, effective April 4, 1988.]</blockquote>\n<p id=\"b296-11\">The State relies on the discretionary arrest provisions of what are presently designated subparagraphs b(l) and b(2).</p>\n<p id=\"b296-12\">For the arrest here to be lawful under subparagraph b(l), Officer Mathis must have had probable cause to believe that (1) defendant had violated the temporary restraining order and (2) the order had been served upon him.</p>\n<p id=\"b296-13\">Dolores\u2019s statement gave the officer probable cause to believe that an existing temporary restraining order had been issued under the act. However, the officer did not know what relief the order provided and therefore did not have probable cause to believe that defendant violated it merely by his presence in the home. Dolores\u2019s demand that defendant be re<page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"267\">*267</page-number>moved from the home did not give the officer a reasonable basis for knowing whether defendant\u2019s presence in the home violated the order, whether defendant had done something else that violated the order or whether defendant had done nothing that violated the order. The officer failed to ask Dolores or anyone at headquarters what the order provided.</p>\n<p id=\"b297-6\">Although the act does not require an arresting officer to verify the existence of a temporary restraining order, he must have some reasonable basis for knowing what conduct the order proscribes or prescribes in order to have probable cause to believe that a person violated it. The arrest was unlawful because the State failed to prove that Officer Mathis had probable cause to believe that defendant violated the provisions of an order issued pursuant to the act.</p>\n<p id=\"b297-7\">Even if our dissenting colleague is correct in concluding that the officer had probable cause to believe that the court had restrained defendant from being in the home, the State did not sustain its burden to prove that the officer had probable cause to believe that defendant had been served with the order, a separate and distinct predicate to a lawful arrest under subparagraph b(l). Without probable cause to believe that defendant had been served with the order, the officer had no basis for believing that defendant violated the order purposefully or knowingly, the culpability necessary to commit a contempt.</p>\n<p id=\"b297-8\">Defendant\u2019s silence cannot be interpreted as an acknowledgment that he had been served with the order. In addition to defendant\u2019s general right to remain silent in the presence of an arresting police officer, there was no occasion for him to deny that he had been served. We cannot tell from Officer Mathis\u2019s testimony whether defendant heard Dolores tell the officer as she let him in that she had obtained the court order and there is no evidence that the officer advised defendant before the arrest that there was a court order. Officer Mathis testified that the only thing he said to defendant was that he had to come to police headquarters.</p>\n<p id=\"b298-4\"><page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"268\">*268</page-number>The dissent appears to proceed from the mistaken assumption that the officer was responding to a domestic violence complaint. Dolores\u2019s complaint was not that defendant had committed an act of domestic violence but that he had violated a court order. The trial judge expressly found that there had been no act of domestic violence and that the officer did not have probable cause to believe otherwise. We have quoted generously from Officer Mathis\u2019s testimony to demonstrate that he perceived little if any evidence to give him probable cause to believe that defendant had committed an act of violence so as to render the arrest lawful under subparagraph b(2). We sustain the trial judge\u2019s conclusion that the officer did not have probable cause to believe that defendant had been violent, because his findings that the officer neither saw nor heard evidence of an act of domestic violence \u201ccould reasonably have been reached on sufficient credible evidence present in the record.\u201d <em>State v. Johnson, </em>42 <em>N.J. </em>146, 162 (1964).</p>\n<p id=\"b298-5\">We share our dissenting colleague\u2019s concern that we not discourage police from arresting a person where there is probable cause to believe that he has knowingly violated a restraining order issued pursuant to the act or has committed an act of domestic violence that prompted the complaint to which the police are responding. At the same time we must not lose sight of legislative limitations on the authority of police officers to arrest a person accused of violating a domestic violence restraining order where the officer does not have probable cause to believe that the order prohibited what would otherwise be lawful conduct, where the officer does not have probable cause to believe that the order had been served on the person accused, or where the officer does not have probable cause to believe that the complaint to which he is responding had been prompted by an act of domestic violence.</p>\n<p id=\"b298-6\">Affirmed.</p>\n<footnote label=\"1\">\n<p id=\"b290-13\">N.J.S.A 2C:25-14d provides:</p>\n<p id=\"b291-10\"><page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"261\">*261</page-number>Emergency relief may include forbidding the defendant from returning to the scene of the domestic violence together with any other appropriate relief.</p>\n</footnote>\n<footnote label=\"2\">\n<p id=\"b291-11\">The act gives the court authority to issue temporary restraining orders that may provide a wide range of unspecified \"emergency relief.\u201d <em>N.J.S.A. </em>2C:25-14b provides:</p>\n<p id=\"b291-12\">If it appears that the plaintiff is in danger of domestic violence, the judge shall, upon consideration of the plaintiffs domestic violence complaint, order emergency relief including ex parte relief, in the nature of a temporary restraining order.

Mathis had been the police dispatcher for two years. He knew that the police had responded to the premises \u201cnumerous times,\u201d not only on \u201cdomestic problems with Rory and his sister,\u201d but also \u201cRory and his father.\u201d Rory Scott was \u201cjust very well known\u201d for trouble at that family.<footnotemark>1</footnotemark> When Mathis got there, he waited for assistance from another officer.</p>\n<p id=\"b299-7\">Mathis heard Rory shouting through the door \u201cmaybe louder\u201d than Dolores, although \u201c[h]e\u2019s hard to understand at times.\u201d Upon entry Mathis found Rory standing and his sister sitting. Although it was afternoon, Rory was clad only in pajama bottoms. Mathis was aware that Rory had previously exposed himself to a neighbor. Dolores reiterated that there was a restraining order, that Rory was \u201ckind of not sane,\u201d that her baby was not safe. Mathis credited Dolores\u2019 statement that she felt she was in danger. Although Rory was passive at the time, Mathis was not satisfied that any danger might have been suppressed. Rory agreed to accompany Mathis to the station, but he had to dress. Mathis kept Rory within his view as Rory went to the end of the small living room beyond a tied-back sheet.<footnotemark>2</footnotemark> Although Mathis\u2019s eye was on Rory, he saw the marijuana which was the subject of the suppression motion.</p>\n<p id=\"b299-8\">From the evidence the motion judge found as a fact:</p>\n<blockquote id=\"b300-4\"><page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"270\">*270</page-number>The officer said he felt he was dangerous, so overall view of the man, even though there are no actual \u2014 I\u2019m not sure anything specific on which the officer felt \u2014 he knew they weren\u2019t getting along. He knew this person was some what erratic in his behavior in the past and displaying himself to the neighbor and multiple calls to the police department, <em>he certainly felt that there was a claim that he was endangering the life of not only the sister but the child.</em></blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b300-5\">The question is: Is that a reasonable suspicion that would give him the right to accompany the defendant to keep him under view.</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b300-6\">There\u2019s paucity, I admit, of any real indication from the officer that he was \u2014 that he, the officer, felt there was any danger that he could see with his own eyes of threatening conduct.

Such surveillance is not an impermissible invasion of the privacy or personal liberty of an individual who has been arrested.

In January 1981, the New Jersey Advisory Committee to the United States Commission on Civil Rights <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"271\">*271</page-number>issued a report called \u201cBattered Women in New Jersey\u201d (Report). In the Report the Commission said that in most New Jersey cities, the police dispatcher screened calls for assistance, two officers responded, but neither had the power to arrest for an offense. New Jersey Advisory Committee, U.S. Comm\u2019n on Civil Rights, Battered Women in New Jersey 11 (1981). The Committee reported a widespread guideline to the police not to arrest. Report, <em>supra, </em>at 10. The Report further detailed many examples and criticisms in which police representatives were quoted as saying that their hands were tied by the law as it was then written. Report, <em>supra, </em>at 13.</p>\n<p id=\"b301-6\">In 1981, when the Legislature responded by enacting New Jersey\u2019s first domestic violence law (L.1981, <em>c. </em>426), it allocated the blame for the inadequacy of the prior law to the \u201csystem\u2019s inability to generate a prompt response in an emergency situation.\u201d <em>N.J.S.A. </em>2C:25-2 (legislative findings and declarations). Following the passage of chapter 426, other reports emphasized the need of emergency response by the police. <em>See </em>Working Group on the Enforcement of the Prevention of Domestic Violence Act, Report (June 1, 1984) (Working Group Report).<footnotemark>3</footnotemark> Without exception, it was the position of concerned groups that the police historically had not responded appropriately to family violence emergencies. <em>See also </em>Finesmith, \u201cPolice Response to Battered Women: Critique and Proposals for Reform,\u201d 14 <em>Seton Hall L.Rev. </em>74 (1983).</p>\n<p id=\"b301-7\">The statute has been amended several times since 1981. An early draft of <em>L. </em>1987, c. 356, changed the officer\u2019s duty under <em>N.J.S.A. </em>2C:25-5b(l) from \u201cmay verify\u201d the existence of a restraining order to \u201cshall verify\u201d its existence. This change was eliminated in the final draft of that amendment. Thus, the legislature recently retained the present statutory language.</p>\n<p id=\"b302-4\"><page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"272\">*272</page-number>I recite this history for two reasons: first, to support this court\u2019s apparent ruling that Mathis need not check upon the dispatcher\u2019s radio assertion, \u201cthat there is a temporary restraining order on Scott, the brother of the complainant,\u201d to have probable cause to believe the order was in effect. In responding to a radio call for help, Mathis was entitled to rely upon the information he was given as sufficient to meet the necessary statutory elements of probable cause to arrest. Respecting the content of the restraining order which Mathis was told existed, Mathis also had a right to believe that the order restrained defendant from the house.<footnotemark>4</footnotemark></p>\n<p id=\"b302-5\">The legislative history is also relevant to the court\u2019s reason for affirmance. The trial court ruled that if there was no restraining order, there was no valid arrest, and if no arrest, there was no plain view of the contraband.<footnotemark>5</footnotemark> While this court does not rely upon the trial court\u2019s finding concerning Mathis\u2019s probable cause to arrest, it would nonetheless affirm, based primarily upon a lack of evidence that Mathis had probable cause to believe the restraining order had been served. I dissent from this view.</p>\n<p id=\"b302-6\">The issue was never raised before the Law Division. Moreover, while no one asked Mathis if he had advised Rory of the existence of the order, it is a reasonable inference from the evidence that the existence of the order was referred to in <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"273\">*273</page-number>Rory\u2019s presence by his sister as well as by Mathis and that Rory never denied its existence.<footnotemark>6</footnotemark> There is no evidence that Mathis had cause to believe the order was <em>not </em>served. While the court does not suggest exactly what Mathis should have done to verify service, other than to advise Rory, I believe Mathis had probable cause to believe the order was served (as he had probable cause to believe that it had been issued) from what the dispatcher told him, as well as from Rory\u2019s silence.</p>\n<p id=\"b303-6\">Although much emphasis has been placed upon Mathis\u2019s acting to enforce a restraining order, in my view, Mathis was also responding to a present domestic violence complaint. Thus there was an issue concerning whether Mathis had a right to arrest under <em>N.J.S.A. </em>2C:25-5b(2). The court\u2019s affirmance on this issue rests on the trial court\u2019s finding that Mathis did not have probable cause to believe that Rory had engaged in any act of domestic violence.<footnotemark>7</footnotemark></p>\n<p id=\"b303-7\">I agree with the court that the trial judge found that Mathis did not see evidence of violence, and that this finding was credibly supported in the record. For purposes of the suppression motion, however, I do not consider that finding material. Mathis was a policeman called to a domestic violence scene. If from all of the circumstances Mathis had cause to believe that Rory had previously engaged in a course of alarming conduct and now presented an immediate danger to Dolores and the <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"274\">*274</page-number>child, Mathis had the right to observe Rory in the minimally intrusive way that he did. I disagree with the trial judge and the court in their apparent view that. Mathis had to see or hear evidence of domestic violence to observe Rory without violating his Fourth Amendment rights.</p>\n<p id=\"b304-5\">I would, moreover, not rest Mathis\u2019s right to observe on his right to arrest under either <em>N.J.S.A. </em>2C:25-5b(1) or <em>N.J.S.A. </em>2C:25-5b(2). Whether he was investigating a domestic violence complaint or waiting to enforce an order, Mathis was following reasonable procedures directed toward protecting police officers as well as domestic violence victims.<footnotemark>8</footnotemark> Acknowledging a self-protective exception from the warrant requirement for keeping a domestic violence defendant in the sight of the officer has the same rationale as permitting the officer to \u201cstop and frisk\u201d a suspect for weapons, that the officer need not risk the officer\u2019s life to protect Fourth Amendment rights. <em>See State v. Thomas, </em>110 <em>N.J. </em>673, 683 (1988).</p>\n<p id=\"b304-6\">In addition to a search incidental to arrest, and the right of the officer to \u201cpursue his investigation without fear of violence,\u201d <em>ibid., </em>the \u201cemergency aid\u201d doctrine is an exception to the warrant requirement.</p>\n<blockquote id=\"b304-7\">Perhaps the most commonly cited statement of the doctrine is found in <em>United States v. Barone, </em>330 <em>F.2d </em>543, 545 (2nd Cir.1964), <em>cert </em>den. 377 <em>U.S. </em>1004, 84 <em>S.Ct. </em>1940, 12 L.Ed.2d 1053 (1964), where the court said: \u2018The right of the police to enter and investigate in an emergency without the accompanying intent to either search or arrest is inherent in the very nature of their duties as police officers, and derives from the common law.' <em>[Gallmeyer v. State, </em>640 P.2d 837, 841 (Alaska Ct.App.1982) (footnote omitted)].</blockquote>\n<p id=\"b304-8\">See generally 2 <em>W.

State, </em>640 P.2d at 841 n. 5. In order to justify a warrantless search based on the police rendering \u201cemergency aid,\u201d there must be (1) the existence of an emergency as viewed objectively (2) a search not motivated by a desire to find evidence and (3) a nexus between the search and the emergency. <em>People v. Mitchell, </em>39 <em>N.Y.2d </em>173, 177, 347 <em>N.E.2d </em>607, 609, 383 <em>N.Y.S.2d </em>246, 248 (Ct.App.1976), <em>cert. </em>den. 426 <em>U.S. </em>953, 96 <em>S.Ct. </em>3178, 49 <em>L.Ed.2d </em>1191 (1976).</p>\n<p id=\"b305-6\">In <em>Gallmeyer v. State </em>evidence was found admissible where police entered the home without defendant\u2019s consent (but without active opposition) in response to a domestic violence call.

Koniecki, </em>135 <em>Ill.App.3d </em>394, 399-401, 90 <em>Ill.Dec. </em>173, 178-79, 481 <em>N.E.2d </em>973, 978-980 (App.Ct.1985) (evidence found by police would have been admissible when one of the house occupants made police reasonably believe the other occupant could be injured and police saw suspected contraband while searching the premises for the injured person; because police reentered the house to identify the contraband, they went beyond the proper reason for unwarranted police entry, and the evidence was not admissible); <em>People v. Schrantz, </em>50 <em>Mich.App. </em>227, 232-233, 213 N.W.2d 257, 260 (Ct.App.1973) (evidence admissible where police forceably entered the house following a neighbor\u2019s report of screams; police knew of defendant\u2019s prior mental commitment and his previous history of violence which they used to obtain a current commitment order); <em>State v.

In <em>State v. Bridewell, </em>306 <em>Or. </em>231, 238, 759 P.2d 1054, 1059 (Sup.Ct.1988), the Oregon Supreme Court rejected a \u201cplain view\u201d argument in support of the admission of contraband as evidence following a police officer\u2019s intrusion into a dwelling to investigate the owner\u2019s disappearance. The court referred to the community \u201ccaretaking\u201d police function, citing <em>Cady v. Dombrowski, </em>413 <em>U.S. </em>433, 93 <em>S.Ct. </em>2523, 37 <em>L.Ed.2d </em>706 (1973), saying,</p>\n<blockquote id=\"b306-6\">[t]here is no <em>generic </em>\u201ccommunity caretaking function.\u201d Whether law enforcement officers have specific functions is a matter of <em>statutory law. </em>[emphasis added].</blockquote>\n<p id=\"b306-7\">In a dissenting opinion, joined by two other members of the court, Chief Justice Peterson presented a comprehensive history of the \u201ccaretaking\u201d function of the police and its relation to the Fourth Amendment (going back to 1335). The Chief Justice concluded that contraband viewed by police while investigating an emergency should not be viewed as the result of a search. Justice Peterson said,</p>\n<blockquote id=\"b306-8\">I maintain that the initial entry upon the defendant\u2019s property was not a search. The entry on the premises was to investigate the report of a concerned person, fearful that her friend was hurt or injured. Entering property to find whether the concerns were well founded was not a \u201csearch\u201d as that term was understood in the state and federal constitutions in 1791 and 1859 and is not a search within the present day meaning of that term.</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b307-5\"><page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"277\">*277</page-number>If the majority rule prevails, the assistance role of law enforcement personnel in this society will go downhill from here. [306 <em>Or. </em>at 253-254, 759 P.2d at 1067-1068].</blockquote>\n<p id=\"b307-6\"><em>N.J.S.A. </em>2C:25-5 codifies an \u201cemergency aid\u201d and a \u201ccommunity caretaking\u201d police function. While Mathis\u2019s reasonable belief is not determinative, there is no doubt that Mathis considered himself a \u201ccaretaker.\u201d<footnotemark>9</footnotemark> Mathis testified that he did not consider his action in enforcing the restraining order (as he understood it), or in asking Rory to go to the station, as an \u201carrest.\u201d Mathis\u2019s stated purpose was merely to \u201cescort\u201d Rory to headquarters to enforce the order. To Mathis, Rory was only \u201carrested\u201d after he saw the marijuana. While that is too narrow a meaning of \u201carrest,\u201d Mathis\u2019s view of his function was objectively reasonable. He was responding to an emergency call for police aid. His observation of contraband was inadvertent and directly connected to his police duty.<footnotemark>10</footnotemark> <em>People v. Mitchell, </em>39 <em>N.Y.2d </em>at 177, 347 <em>N.E.2d </em>at 609, 383 <em>N.Y.S.2d </em>at 248. He also was taking reasonable self-protective measures. <em>State v. Thomas, </em>110 <em>N.J. </em>at 683.</p>\n<p id=\"b307-7\">I would resolve the appeal from the order granting the suppression motion, therefore, by applying legal principles independent of Mathis\u2019s right to arrest to the facts as found by the trial judge. Applying those principles, including the doctrines of \u201cemergency aid,\u201d \u201ccommunity caretaking\u201d and <em>Terry v. Ohio, </em>392 <em>U.S. </em>1, 21-22, 88 <em>S.Ct. </em>1868, 1879-1880, 20 <em>L.Ed.2d </em>889 (1968), I would find that Mathis\u2019s actions accorded objectively with approved police procedure and the Act; his inadvertent observation of marijuana in the process was not an impermissible search and the evidence should not have been suppressed. Accordingly, I respectfully dissent.</p>\n<footnote label=\"1\">\n<p id=\"b299-9\">Mathis said he was involved in or heard incidents between Dolores and Rory Scott.
