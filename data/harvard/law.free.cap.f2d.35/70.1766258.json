M. Berg, 1,364,829, January 4, 1921, 81/53. Additional useful modifications have been made over the Berg patent, but there is no ornamentation possessing'originality and beauty sufficient to justify granting a design patent under the statute, the purpose of which has oftimes been declared to be to encourage art and decoration which appeals to the esthetic sense.

D. 251.</p>\n<p id=\"b99-8\">The rejection of the application by the Commissioner seems to he based upon well-settled principles. Nothing has been shown to us to indicate that the decision was erroneous. The Commissioner\u2019s decision is therefore affirmed.</p>\n<p id=\"b99-9\">Affirmed.</p>\n</opinion>\n</casebody>\n",
