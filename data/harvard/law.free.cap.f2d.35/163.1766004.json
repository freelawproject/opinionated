that the Improvement Association for Blind People, incorporated in 1910 as a corporation not for pecuniary profit, maintains in Chicago a trade school for training blind people, designated as \u201cThe Chicago lighthouse\u201d; that from 1922 to 1926, with blind people as weavers, it had produced rugs at the rate of approximately 250 a week; that similarly designated training schools for blind people are being operated in other cities, including Duluth, Minneapolis, New Orleans, Syracuse, New York, and Seattle, in which rugs made by blind people are produced; and that \u201cthe word \u2018Lighthouse\u2019 when used in connection with rugs or other articles is understood by a substantial portion of the publie to indicate that they were produced by the work of blind people.\u201d</p>\n<p id=\"b192-15\">It was further alleged that petitioner had purchased and resold the rugs of the Chicago Lighthouse until October 19, 1926, when the latter\u2019s superintendent and the 16 blind people employed in the Lighthouse in making rugs were employed by petitioner in its factory for similar work; that petitioner manufactures upon power looms, operated by people who are not blind, other rugs similar in every way to those manufactured by the blind people; that petitioner labels all of said rugs \u201cLight House Rugs,\u201d wi^h the depiction of a lighthouse, and issues advertising matter containing the words, \u201cSole Distributors of The Chicago Lighthouse, an Institution for the Blind,\u201d a cut of a lighthouse, illustrations of rugs and photographs of scenes showing blind persons weaving rugs; that said labels and advertising matter falsely imply that all of said rugs are produced by the labor of blind people, deceive a substantial portion of the purchasing public into the erroneous belief that all the rugs manufactured by the petitioner are produced by the labor of blind people, induce purchasers thereof to purchase the same in that belief and divert trade from the purchasers of truthfully marked rugs.</p>\n<p id=\"b192-16\">After petitioner had filed in this court its petition to review the order above set forth, the respondent commission filed an answer in the nature of a cross-bill, asking for an order of compliance, to which the petitioner filed an answer admitting that it had not complied with the order.</p>\n<p id=\"b192-17\">The petitioner admits that it may not use the words forbidden in paragraph 2 of the order, \u201cSole Distributors of The Chicago Lighthouse, an Institution for the Blind,\u201d <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"165\">*165</page-number>and that it may not in any way imply that its products are made by blind people when such is not the fact, as forbidden in paragraph 4; but it contends that it may lawfully use the word \u201cLight House\u201d and the symbol thereof.</p>\n<p id=\"b193-5\">Whether the use of the word \u201cLight House,\u201d alone or in. combination as a corporate trade-name, and the picture of the lighthouse, as forbidden by paragraphs 1 and 3, is legally wrongful depends primarily upon whether or not the finding of the respondent, to the effect, in substance, that the word \u201cLight House,\u201d as a term applied to rugs, has acquired amongst a substantial portion of the trade a secondary meaning, i. e., rugs made by the blind in charitable or quasi charitable institutions for the blind, called \u201cLighthouses,\u201d has the substantial support by evidence required by the law. Philip Carey Mfg. Co. v. Federal Trade Commission (C. C. A.) 29 F.(2d) 49; Chamber of Commerce of Minneapolis v. Federal Trade Commission (C. C. A.) 280 F. 45; and Arkansas Wholesale Grocers\u2019 Ass\u2019n v. Federal Trade Commission (C. C. A.) 18 F.(2d) 866.</p>\n<p id=\"b193-6\">Such findings of facts, if substantially supported by the evidence, are, under section 5 of the Federal Trade Commission Act (15 USCA \u00a7 45), conclusive. The Supreme Court in Federal Trade Commission v. Curtis Publishing Co., 260 U. S. 568, 43 S. Ct. 210, 213, 214, 67 L. Ed. 408, says: \u201cManifestly, the court must inquire whether the Commission\u2019s findings of fact are supported by evidence. If so supported, they are conclusive. * * \u00ae I think it of high importance that we should scrupulously comply with the evident intention of Congress that the Federal Commission be made the fact-finding body and that the Court should in its rulings preserve the Board\u2019s character as such, and not interject its views of the facts where there is any conflict in the evidence.\u201d</p>\n<p id=\"b193-8\">An examination of the record discloses that in 1910 the New York institute for the blind named and designated its building \u201cThe Lighthouse.\u201d Its founder later established the Paris \u201cLighthouse\u201d for men blinded in the World War. Similar associations, known and designated as \u201cLighthouses,\u201d have been established in many cities of the United States and have come to be known by the public as workshops in which blind people are instructed in useful occupations, particularly rug weaving, as that work has been found to be the most practical and suitable for such persons. The New York institute, in connection with the word \u201cLighthouse,\u201d since 1910 has used the picture of a lighthouse as a symbol to designate its workshops, its summer place in Cornwall, and its camp in New Jersey, all maintained for blind people. It has used the word \u201cLighthouse\u201d and the symbol upon its advertising, literature, labels, stationery, folders, and rugs, which have reached apparently thousands of people.</p>\n<p id=\"b193-10\">The workshop conducted by the St. Louis County Association for the Blind, in Duluth, Minn., since 1919, and similar workshops for blind people operated in Seattle, Wash., Buffalo, and Syracuse, have used and are using the word \u201cLighthouse\u201d upon labels, tags, and stationery. All of them make rugs by the work of blind people and so indicate on the tags used. These institutions have for a long time caused the word \u201cLighthouse\u201d to be associated in the public mind with work for or in the interest of blind people and their products. The Improvement Association for Blind People has conducted the \u201cChicago Lighthouse\u201d since 1915. It adopted, as a symbol, a picture of a lighthouse, which it placed upon its stationery, labels and literature. Its rugs, woven by blind people, bore tags upon which were the words, \u201cWoven by the Blind of the Chicago Lighthouse;\u201d and until 1922 these rugs were sold through the Artists\u2019 Guild and similar outlets. Between 1922 and 1926 the rugs were sold to Morris Kline, who resold them as rugs produced by the blind at \u201cThe Chicago Lighthouse.\u201d</p>\n<p id=\"b193-11\">There was evidence that the word \u201cLighthouse,\u201d in the understanding of the public, has become firmly associated with blind people and the rugs made by them. Witnesses for respondent testified that they had been familiar, since 1915, with the use of the word \u201cLighthouse\u201d to describe products of the blind; that \u201cthe term used in connection with the manufacture of fugs is quite generally the word \u2018Lighthouse\u2019 \u201d; and that \u201cthe general public is quite generally associating the word \u2018Lighthouse\u2019 with works that are products of the blind.\u201d There was extensive evidence of other facts in addition to those recited, material to be considered in connection therewith.</p>\n<p id=\"b193-12\">In this situation it is obvious that the finding of the commission as to the secondary meaning of the word \u201cLighthouse,\u201d has substantial support in the evidence before the commission, and under the statute and the Supreme Court\u2019s interpretation is conclusive upon this court.</p>\n<p id=\"b193-13\">There was substantial evidence to the <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"166\">*166</page-number>contrary offered by petitioner, and, if tbe finding of tbe commission had been to the contrary, such finding likewise would have been conclusive upon this court.</p>\n<p id=\"b194-4\">There remains the further inquiry as to whether the finding of the commission as to unfair competition has substantial support in the evidence. The rugs produced by blind people as heretofore mentioned come in competition with petitioner\u2019s product. The record discloses that agents of petitioner and of its dealers, soliciting purchases of rugs in various districts likewise supplied by institutions for the blind, repeatedly misrepresented that the rugs made by petitioner were made by the blind at Duluth Lighthouse for the Blind, or at the \u201cLighthouse\u201d for the blind at Milwaukee, or by the blind at Chicago, or by the blind at Minneapolis, and made other similar representations; that in New York, Duluth, Milwaukee, Minneapolis, and elsewhere, purchasers of rugs were repeatedly confused as to \u201cLighthouse\u201d rugs sold by petitioner, in that they purchased rugs upon such representations as created the impressions and beliefs that they were buying the product of the blind made at \u201cLighthouses\u201d for the blind maintained at various places. These latter institutions, in attempting to sell their rugs, frequently lost their sales because people solicited had previously purchased petitioner\u2019s rugs upon the belief that they were the products of the charitable \u201cLighthouses\u201d of Duluth, Milwaukee, New York, Chicago, or elsewhere. After giving orders to petitioner some purchasers, discovering that petitioner\u2019s rugs were factory made at Chicago, refused to accept same. Petitioner\u2019s agents frequently did not know whether their samples were machine made or made by the blind, but represented them as made by the blind or finished by the blind.</p>\n<p id=\"b194-5\">There was 'other and substantial evidence of confusion, deception, and unfair competition, to such an extent that the finding of the commission is amply supported thereby and is therefore conclusive upon this court.</p>\n<p id=\"b194-6\">With conclusive findings of the commission to the effeet that the word \u201cLighthouse,\u201d when used in connection with the sale of rugs, has acquired a secondary meaning, i. e., rugs made by blind people in institutions for the blind, and that unfair competition is being conducted by the petitioner with respect thereto, it is apparent that the order of the commission is justified under the law, unless it be that such order is broader than is proper. Baglin v. Cusenier Co., 221 U. S. 580, 31 S. Ct. 669, 55 L. Ed. 863; Computing Scale Co. v. Standard Computing Scale Co. (C. C. A.) 118 F. 965; Buzby v. Davis, (C. C. A.) 150 F. 275, 10 Ann. Cas. 68; Trappey v. McIlhenny Co. (C. C. A.) 281 F. 23; Photoplay Pub. Co. v. La Verne Pub. Co. (C. C. A.) 269 F. 730; British-American Tobacco Co. v. British-American Cigar Stores Co. (C. C. A.) 211 F. 933, Ann. Cas. 1915B, 363; Rosenberg v. Elliott (C. C. A.) 7 F.(2d) 962; Florence Mfg. Co. v. Dowd <em>&amp; </em>Co. (C. C. A.) 178 F. 73.</p>\n<p id=\"AUX\">Petitioner contends that it should not be enjoined from using the word \u201cLighthouse\u201d in conjunction with its corporate name in advertising' its articles for distribution in interstate commerce. In British-American Tobacco Co. v. British-American Cigar Stores Co., 211 F. 933, 935, Ann. Cas. 1915B, 363, the Court of Appeals for the Second Circuit held that the defendant should be enjoined from the use of the word \u201cBritish-American\u201d in its corporate name, saying: \u201cIf there were any valid reason for adopting the name, or if the business were other than tobacco, there might be some reason for the defendant\u2019s action, but no honest reason can be suggested for appropriating the name of the old and long established company. In the absence of any plausible explanation we have a right to assume that the reason was to secure the advantages which would result from a supposed connection with the well known company.\u201d</p>\n<p id=\"b194-9\">In Juvenile Shoe Co. v. Federal Trade Commission, 289 F. 57, 58, the Court of Appeals for the Ninth Circuit approved an order of the commission enjoining the Juvenile Shoe' Company from using the word \u201cJuvenile,\u201d in view of the prior use of the same by the Juvenile Shoe Corporation. The court said: \u201cThe petitioner went into the business of manufacturing and selling children\u2019s shoes and took a name so similar to a senior corporation that was engaged in precisely the same business and in the same field-that confusion of the two corporations in the public mind was inevitable. The names \u2018Juvenile Shoe Corporation\u2019 and \u2018Juvenile Shoe Company, Inc.,\u2019 are practically identical. The reported eases in which injunction has been sustained against the use of a corporate name afford few instances of names so similar and so likely to create confusion as those which these two corporations used. In assuming its name, a corporation acts at its peril.\u201d Of similar purport is Computing Scale Co. v. Standard Computing Scale Co. (C. C. A.) 118 F. 965.</p>\n<p id=\"b194-10\">Here the petitioner, incorporated under the name of \u201cThe Light House Rug Com<page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"167\">*167</page-number>pany,\u201d engaged in manufacturing rugs for profit, and adopted a facsimile of the symbol of the Chicago Lighthouse for the blind. This symbol it placed upon all its literature and labels. It knew that prior to such incorporation the Chicago Lighthouse had adopted said symbol; that other institutions for the blind had likewise adopted the name \u201cLighthouse\u201d and a similar symbol. Of the secondary meaning, as found to exist by the commission, it was bound to have notice. It made rugs both by sighted people and by blind people. It went into competition with, institutions for the blind. Its rugs made by blind people admittedly cost more to produce than those made by looms. It produced twice as many rugs by looms operated by sighted people as it did by the work of blind people. It is obvious that, inasmuch as it was not an eleemosynary institution, the employment of blind people, the deceptive name \u201cLighthouse,\u201d and the use of the facsimile picture of the lighthouse of the institution for the blind, were intended to and did tend to promote its competition with institutions for the blind by inducing in the minds of purchasers the belief that the product was made by the blind in an institution for the blind known as a \u201cLighthouse.\u201d The reasoning of the two eases cited applies directly to the situation in the instant case; and' the order to desist from the use of such corporate name is authorized and proper.</p>\n<p id=\"b195-4\">The petitioner contends that it has ceased the practice mentioned in paragraph 3 of the order, and that therefore the Commission should not have included that paragraph. Under the facts shown the commission was justified in its action in that respect. Sears, Roebuck &amp; Co. v. Federal Trade Commission (C. C. A.) 258 F. 307, 6 A. L. R. 358.</p>\n<p id=\"b195-5\">There will be a decree in accordance with the commission\u2019s order and providing for compliance therewith as prayed by respondent.</p>\n</opinion>\n</casebody>\n",
