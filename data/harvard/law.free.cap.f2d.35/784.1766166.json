Tbe trade-mark sought to be registered consists of the words \u201cWashington Park,\u201d arranged in a somewhat rectangular border, with what is presumed to be an outline of tbe bead of George Washington arranged at tbe lower part of tbe border.</p>\n<p id=\"b812-17\">The marks of appellant upon which tbe opposition is based consist of tbe words \u201cFashion Park,\u201d \u201cFashion Park Clothes,\u201d and \u201cTailored at Fashion Park\u201d; all of the registrations, in addition to tbe words used, have a figure of two men on horseback. Tbe goods of both parties to which tbe marks are applied are tbe same, namely, men\u2019s outer clothing.</p>\n<p id=\"b812-18\">Tbe only question in tbe ease is whether applicant\u2019s mark so resembles that of opposer that confusion in trade is likely from their use. None of the testimony of opposer tended to show such confusion, and the matter must be determined from a consideration of tbe marks themselves.</p>\n<p id=\"b812-19\">The only common feature of appellant\u2019s and appellee\u2019s marks is tbe word \u201cPark.\u201d Appellant has not acquired tbe exclusive use of the word \u201cpark\u201d in a trade-mark, and therefore tbe question' is: Do tbe words \u201cWashington Park\u201d so nearly resemble the words \u201cFashion Park\u201d as to cause confusion or mistake in tbe mind of tbe public, or to deceive purchasers?</p>\n<p id=\"b812-20\">We agree with tbe Commissioner that tbe words \u201cFashion\u201d and \u201cWashington\u201d have nothing in common in appearance, sound, or significance, and we do not believe that tbe use of tbe words \u201cWashington Park\u201d would be confused by purchasers of men\u2019s outer clothing with tbe words \u201cFashion Park.\u201d</p>\n<p id=\"b812-21\">Tbe decision of the Commissioner is affirmed.</p>\n<p id=\"b812-22\">Affirmed.</p>\n</opinion>\n</casebody>\n",
