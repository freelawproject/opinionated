In general configuration, except as to the degree or slant of the curves or angles, there is very little difference between applicant\u2019s design and the Whitehead design of the sectional clock ease. In the front of the ease is a circular opening of substantially the same size as in the Whitehead design. In applicant\u2019s design the opening is covered by a grill, instead of a clock face, through which sounds from the radio are transmitted. In the Wright design of the prism plate we find substantially the same configuration as in the grill work of applicant\u2019s design.</p>\n<p id=\"b91-22\">In other words, if the Whitehead clock case was fitted with the Wright prism plate and used for a radio reproducer, substantially the same result in purpose and ornamentation would be accomplished. Applicant has combined two old features without new ornamentation. There is no such new invented beauty of artistic conception as to be patentable. Baker et al. v. Hughes-Evans Co. (C. C. A.) 270 F. 97.</p>\n<p id=\"b91-23\">We see no invention in applicant\u2019s design.</p>\n<p id=\"b91-24\">The decision of the Board of Patent Appeals is affirmed.</p>\n<p id=\"b91-25\">Affirmed.</p>\n</opinion>\n</casebody>\n",
