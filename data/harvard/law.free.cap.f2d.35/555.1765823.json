The bill also sought an accounting.</p>\n<p id=\"b584-14\">Jurisdiction depends as to the first claim upon the trade-mark laws and as to the second upon diverse citizenship and the amount in controversy. The defendant, the Dumore Company of Dayton, Ohio, denied (1) the jurisdiction of the court upon the claim for unfair competition; (2) the valid! ty of the trade-marks; and (3) any infringement. The court sustained the trademarks as valid, and held that they were not infringed, but found that the word \u201cDu-more,\u201d plaintiff\u2019s alleged trade-mark, had acquired a secondary meaning, and, as incidental to its jurisdiction under the trademark laws, enjoined defendant from using it in connection with its corporate name, the Dumore Company. In compliance defendant changed its name to \u201cDayton Washer Company,\u201d and did not appeal. Plaintiff appealed.</p>\n<p id=\"b584-16\">The trade-mark 119,596, over which is the chief controversy, adopted by plaintiff in 1913, and registered November 27,1917, consisted of the word \u201cDumore,\u201d and had been used on its products, to wit, electric sewing machine motors, electric polishers and buffers, portable electric grinders, portable electric grills, electric cloth cutters, electric hair driers, electric shoe driers, and electric drink mixers. It was made up from the words \u201cDo\u201d (misspelled) and \u201cmore.\u201d The defendant company was organized in August, 1926, for manufacturing electric washing machines. It went into production in January, 1927, and over notice and protest from plaintiff adopted the same word in the same form for its trade-mark.</p>\n<p id=\"b584-17\">The primary question upon plaintiff\u2019s claim of unfair competition is, of course, that of jurisdiction. The court declined jurisdiction upon this feature upon the idea that \u201cthe right in controversy is the right to use the trade-mark \u2018Dumore\u2019 upon washing machines, or, conversely stated, perhaps, the value in controversy may be said to be the damage to the complainant from such alleged wrongful use.\u201d The court held that this alleged right of defendant was not shown to be in excess of $3,000 in value, and indeed not shown to be valuable at all, because defendant had just started in business, and that, because there was no competition between plaintiff and defendant in the same class of merchandise, plaintiff had not suffered damages in any substantial amount. We think jurisdiction depends, not alone upon the pecuniary damage resulting from the acts complained of, but also upon the value of the rights which plaintiff seeks to .have protected. Hunt v. New York Cotton Exchange, 205 U. S. 332, 335, 27 S. Ct. 529, 51 L. Ed. 821; Bitterman v. L. &amp; N. R. R. Co., 207 U. S. 205, 225, 28 S. Ct. 91, 52 L. Ed. 171, 12 Ann. Cas. 693; Glenwood Light &amp; Water Co. v. Mutual Light, Heat &amp; Power Co., 239 U. S. 121, 125, 36 S. Ct. <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"557\">*557</page-number>30, 60 L. Ed. 174; Western &amp; A. R. R. Co. v. Railroad Comm\u2019n, 261 U. S. 264, 267, 43 S. Ct. 252, 67 L. Ed. 645.</p>\n<p id=\"b585-5\">The plaintiff alleged the requisite jurisdictional amount, \u2014 the defendant denied it in its answer only. There was no formal plea to the jurisdiction, and it was not therefore incumbent upon the plaintiff to offer proof in support of it. Bitterman v. L. &amp; N. R. R. Co., supra, at page 224 of 207 U. S., 28 S. Ct. 91, 52 L. Ed. 171, 12 Ann. Cas. 693. Nevertheless, plaintiff\u2019s proof tended to show value in the word as applicable to its business, and, even upon the assumption that the denial in the answer presented an issue, the burden fell upon defendant to establish, by a preponderance of the evidence, that the jurisdictional amount was not involved. Hunt v. N. Y. Cotton Exchg., supra, at page 333, of 205 U. S., 27 S. Ct. 529, 51 L. Ed. 821. We find no merit in the attack upon the court\u2019s jurisdiction.</p>\n<p id=\"b585-6\">As to the validity of the word \u201cDu-more\u201d as a trade-mark: The District Court inclined to the belief, and our judgment is, that this \u201cmade up\u201d word was descriptive of the characteristics of the electric tools and appliances manufactured and sold by plaintiff. It rather clearly signified to any <em>prospective </em>purchaser that these tools had superior capabilities. See Delaware <em>&amp; </em>H. Canal Co. v. Clark, 80 U. S. 311, 328, 20 L. Ed. 581; Standard Paint Co. v. Trinidad Asph. Mfg. Co., 220. U. S. 451, 454, 31 S. Ct. 456, 55 L. Ed. 536; Barton et al. v. Rex-Oil Co., Inc. (C. C. A.) 2 F.(2d) 403, 404; Ungles-Hoggette Co. v. Farmers\u2019 Hog <em>&amp; </em>Cattle Powder Co., 232 F. 116, 118 (C. C. A. 8); Lawrence Mfg. Co. v. Tenn. Mfg. Co., 138 U. S. 537, 547, 11 S. Ct. 396, 34 L. Ed. 997; Jell-Well Dessert Co. v. Jell-X-Cell Co. (C. C. A.) 22 F.(2d) 522, 523; Computing Scale Co. v. Standard Computing Scale Co., 118 F. 965, 967 (C. C. A. 6); A. J. Krank Mfg. Co. v. Pabst, 277 F. 15, 18 (C. C. A. 6).</p>\n<p id=\"b585-7\">It falls in the class with such terms as \u201cComputing\u201d as applied to scales (Computing Scale Co. v. Standard Computing Scale Co., supra); \u201cHappy\u201d as applied to horse feed (Alfocorn Milling Co. v. Edgar-Morgan Co., 282 F. 394 [C. C. A. 8]); \u201cKeep Clean\u201d as applied to tooth brushes (Florence Mfg. Co. v. Dowd &amp; Co., 178 F. 73 [C. C. A. 2]); \u201cStabrite\u201d as applied to polish (In re Chas. R. Long, Jr., Co., 51 App. D. C. 399, 280 F. 795); \u201cDyanshine\u201d as applied to leather dressing (Barton v. Rex Oil Co., supra); \u201cInstantaneous\u201d as applied to tapioca (Bennett v. McKinley [C. C. A.] 65 F. 505); \u201cDry Dip\u201d as applied to vermin powder (Ungles-Hoggette Mfg. Co. v. Farmers\u2019 Hog &amp; Cattle Powder Co., supra); and \u201cInfallible\u201d as applied to smokeless powder (Hercules Powder Co. v. Newton, 266 F. 169 [C. C. A. 2]). Any other manufacturer of electrically driven tools might employ the word with equal right. Plaintiff\u2019s trade-mark being held invalid, this feature of its suit must fail.</p>\n<p id=\"b585-9\">This leaves for consideration plaintiff\u2019s elaim of unfair competition. There was never any competition between the parties in their manufactured products. The plaintiff never made or sold washing machines, and the defendant never made or sold anything else. But this equitable doctrine is not confined to eases of actual market competition between similar products of the parties. It extends to all eases in which one party fraudulently seeks to sell his goods as those of another. Vogue Co. v. Thompson-Hudson Co., 300 F. 509, 512 (C. C. A. 6); Kellogg Toasted Corn Flake Co. v. Quaker Oats Co., 235 F. 657, 664 (C. C. A. 6); Peninsular Chemical Co. v. Levinson, 247 F. 658, 661 (C. C. A. 6); Akron-Overland Tire Co. v. Willys-Overland Tire Co., 273 F. 674, 676 (C. C. A. 3); Wall v. Rolls-Royce of America, 4 F.(2d) 333, 334 (C. C. A. 3).</p>\n<p id=\"b585-10\">Prima facie there is no fraud or misrepresentation in using as a mark upon his goods any word one chooses, even though another dealer in the same line has already adopted it. This is so because, ordinarily, all have equal rights in the use' of language, but, if through its long use as applicable to a particular product or business a word has come to have , a \u201csecondary meaning,\u201d he who has thus adopted it is entitled to protection. It is unnecessary to dwell on the phrase \u201csecondary meaning.\u201d It has been accurately defined in Merriam v. Saalfield, 198 F. 369, 373 (C. C. A. 6). See, also, Upjohn Co. v. Wm. S. Merrell Chem. Co., 269 F. 209 (C. C. A. 6); Kellogg Toasted Corn Flake Co. v. Quaker Oats Co., supra; Standard Paint Co. v. Rubberoid Roofing Co., 224 F. 695 (C. C. A. 7).</p>\n<p id=\"b585-11\">Controlled by these cases, we conclude that, although invalid as a technical trademark, the word \u201cDumore\u201d is abundantly shown to have acquired a secondary meaning as applicable to plaintiff\u2019s business. Plaintiff has used it as a trade-mark since its organization in 1913. It has placed it on all its products, except on such of its small motors as it sold to other manufaetur<page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"558\">*558</page-number>ers. Plaintiff\u2019s gross business for the fourteen years of its existence has been more than $5,000,000. During the year 1926 it amounted to $1,132,000. About 65 per cent, of this represented products to which the word \u201cDumore\u201d was applied. These products had acquired an enviable reputation for superior excellence and quality. The name of. its home office building is the Du-more building. It frequently receives letters addressed to the Dumore Company. It advertises extensively in magazines and trade journals. For this advertising it has expended in the last few years more than $35,000 annually. The word \u201cDumore\u201d is always displayed in bold type in these advertisements. Their products are generally known in the trade as \u201cDumore\u201d products, and are advertised and called for as such by the retail trade. Their representatives are frequently referred to as \u201cthe Dumore men.\u201d</p>\n<p id=\"b586-4\">While there can be no recovery in an action for unfair competition except upon proof of fraud or wrongful intent in fact (Samson Cordage Works v. Puritan Cordage Mills, 211 F. 603, 608, L. R. A. 1915F, 1107 [C. C. A. 6]; Kellogg Toasted Corn Flake Co. v. Quaker Oats Co., supra), yet that intent may be established by circumstances (M. C. Peters Milling Co. v. Internat. Sugar Feed No. 2 Co. [C. C. A.] 262 F. 336, 340; O. <em>&amp; </em>W. Thum Co. v. Dickinson, 245 F. 609, 610, 621 [C. C. A. 6]). Judge Warrington, delivering the opinion in the latter ease, said:</p>\n<blockquote id=\"b586-5\">\u201cScarcely anything of an evidential nature, for example, could more certainly characterize intent than repeated imitation of material parts of another person\u2019s trade tokens; the imitations themselves reveal the object.\u201d</blockquote>\n<p id=\"b586-6\">See, also, Wall v. Rolls-Royce of America, supra; S. S. Kresge Co. v. Champion Spark Plug Co., 3 F.(2d) 415, 419 (C. C. A. 6).</p>\n<p id=\"b586-7\">Defendant was incorporated in. August, 1926. Out of all the corporate names it might have chosen, it styled itself \u201cThe Dumore Company.\u201d Out of the entire field of trade-names it chose the same word \u201cDu-more,\u201d which plaintiff had used for sixteen years. It made up this word from the words \u201cDo\u201d and \u201cmore\u201d just as plaintiff had done. It used capital letters as in the drawing in plaintiff\u2019s application for the mark. Before it went into production it was given notice of the strong probability of confusion in the trade due to its adoption of the word. After production began, it was again notified, but persisted in its use. It designed and used a label for its products in which the word \u201cDumore\u201d is given prominence. On the label is printed the words \u201cThe Du-more Company, Dayton, Ohio, U. S. A.,\u2019\u2019 but this name and address inconspicuous as compared with the word \u201cDumore.\u201d Its product was electrically driven by small motors with lamp socket attachment just as were plaintiff\u2019s products. It was, of course, for domestic use, just as were many of plaintiff\u2019s appliances. Products similar to those of plaintiff are often found in the same stores with electric washing machines. Defendant sold about 400 of its machines up to November, 1927. It is true that the vice president of defendant testifies that he had never heard of the name \u201cDumore\u201d as a trade-mark before he adopted it but the reeoyd sh'eds no light as to what any other officer or agent of the company knew. If he had never heard of it, it is a strange coincidence, not only that he selected plaintiff\u2019s word, but that he made it up from the same words in the same form and misspelled in the same way. It was not essential that plaintiff prove any particular injury or that any purchaser was misled. Bickmore Gall Cure Co. v. Karns, 134 F. 833, 835 (C. C. A. 3). It is sufficient if there was manifest liability to deceive, Ralston Purina Co. v. Western Grain Co., 23 F.(2d) 253, 255 (C. C. A. 5), or, if there was reasonable probability of injury, Peninsular Chem. Co. v. Levinson, supra. That there was such reasonable probability is obvious. Illustrations may be found in Vogue Co. v. Thompson-Hudson Co., supra; Peninsular Chemical Co. v. Levinson, supra, and Wall v. Rolls-Royce, supra.</p>\n<p id=\"b586-9\">That plaintiff is entitled to relief is clear. The relief granted by the District Court was incidental te the jurisdiction it assumed in determining the validity of the word \u201cDumore\u201d as a technical trade-mark. We conclude that it- should be based upon the theory herein set forth. The District Court enjoined the defendant from the further use of the name \u201cDumore\u201d as a trademark on its washing machines in connection With the corporate name, \u201cthe Dumore Company,\u201d or any other corporate name or business title which includes the word \u201cDumore.\u201d The effect is to allow defendant to use the' word \u201cDumore\u201d alone. But the word, in substantially the same form, has been so long associated in the trade with plaintiff\u2019s goods that there is a likelihood shading almost into certainty that any electrically driven device labeled \u2018.\u2018Dumore\u201d only <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"559\">*559</page-number>would be regarded as plaintiff\u2019s product. To obviate such manifest probability, tbe defendant may use the word \u201cDumore\u201d only when accompanied with its present corporate name, Dayton Washer Company. It may not use it otherwise.</p>\n<p id=\"b587-4\">Thus modified, the decree is affirmed.</p>\n</opinion>\n</casebody>\n",
