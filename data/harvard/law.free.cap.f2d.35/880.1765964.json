On February 10, 1920, appellant entered into a verbal agreement with the White Marble Lime Company (hereinafter called the lime company) for the purchase of 4,000,000 feet of box lumber; the agreement was confirmed under the same date, as follows:</p>\n<blockquote id=\"b908-24\">\u201cWhite Marble Lime Co., Manistique,, Mich. Attention Mr. W. B. Thomas. My dear Mr. Thomas: Confirming the writer\u2019s conversation with you.

Thomas, Mgr.\u201d</blockquote>\n<p id=\"Aebv\">On September 16, 1920, the lime company addressed a communication to appellant, in part as follows; \u201c * * * Referring to the contract of date February 10th. We will not be enabled to furnish four million feet due to the strike conditions whereby we were not enabled to start our mill until late in July, whereas at the time of making the contract, I expected to start in April. \u00bb * * Owing to the labor conditions and strike which are beyond our control, I would estimate that our 1920 cut will be in the neighborhood of 2% million feet. You understand this is simply an estimate as I do not know what the conditions from now to January first will be. * 9 * \u201d</p>\n<p id=\"b909-12\">Mr. Parr, the president and general manager of appellant, made an inspection from time to time of the lumber covered by the contract, including \u201can inspection on or immediately before December 31, 1920.\u201d He found that the lumber purchased under the contract had been placed in pile and was marked in accordance with the trade custom as being sold to appellant.</p>\n<p id=\"b909-13\">On' December 30, 1920, appellant wrote the lime company as follows:</p>\n<blockquote id=\"b909-14\">\u201cWe would like to have you mail us a blanket invoice for the box lumber that we have on order from you.</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b909-15\">\u201cEnclosed you will find a Memo of the charge that we have put through our books.

The value of the invoiced lumber then in the yard of the lime company was included in appellant\u2019s inventory of December 31, 1920, at $50,429'.85, which was the fair market value of the lumber on that date.</p>\n<p id=\"b909-35\">Under date of February 26,1921, the lime company addressed a communication to appellant as follows:</p>\n<blockquote id=\"b909-36\">\u201cAttached you will find estimate of lumber in pile cut in the months \u00f3f July, August and September.</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b909-37\">\u201cI have with-held asking for settlement on any of this lumber appreciating your condition. But it has now come to a point where I must have funds to take care of camp labor\u2019 orders, and I will be obliged if you will send us trade acceptances to the amount of $15,-000.00 to be made in amounts of $2,500.00 each. Lumber to cover to be marked up with your name.</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b909-38\">\u201cI would be obliged if these would reach me by return mail.\u201d</blockquote>\n<p id=\"b909-39\">The difference between the cost of the lumber in pile in the yard of the lime company as of December 31, 1920, $70,601.80, and the market,value thereof, $50,429.85, was claimed by appellant in its income tax returns in 1920 as a deductible loss. This claim was disallowed by the Commissioner, and his decision was affirmed by the Board.</p>\n<p id=\"b909-40\">The lumber covered by the above invoice and in pile at the yard of the lime company on December 31, 1920, was charged to appellant and received and accepted by it from time to time during 1921 and 1922. In August, 1921, appellant \u201cprevailed upon the <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"882\">*882</page-number>White Marble Lime Company to adjust the contract price to $16.25 per M ft. of lumber. All the shipments from lumber in pile on December 31, 1920, were settled on that basis.\u201d</p>\n<p id=\"Aof\">Counsel for appellee contends that \u201cthe decision of the Board of Tax Appeals complained of in this appeal was upon an issue of fact, which this court lacks jurisdiction to review,\u201d and in support of the contention cites our opinion in Henderson Iron Works <em>&amp; </em>Supply Co. v. Blair, 58 App. D. C. 114, 25 F.(2d) 538, 539. In that case this court pointed out that the record contained certain testimony which doubtless was heard by the Board, but which was not verified either by stipulation or bill of exceptions. After stating that the issue in the ease was one of fact on which the burden of proof rested upon the taxpayer, and that the only evidence introduced to prove that fact was the testimony of one witness whose testimony \u201cwas so indefinite as to justify the Board\u2019s decision against appellant,\u201d the Court observed: \u201cMoreover a decision of the Board of Tax Appeals, when based upon testimony taken at the trial of an issue of fact, should not be reversed by an appellate court because of a difference of opinion as to the mere weight of the evidence.\u201d In the present ease, as already observed, the facts are not in dispute. We are concerned here merely with the legal effect of those facts; that is, whether under those facts the title to the invoiced lumber had passed to appellant on or before December 31, 1920. Clearly, we not only have jurisdiction, but it is our duty to determine, this question.</p>\n<p id=\"b910-4\">Counsel for appellant, in a scholarly and helpful brief, concedes that the contract under consideration \u201cis admittedly one \u2018to sell\u2019 rather than \u2018of sale\u2019 \u201d; that \u201cit also clearly involves \u2018unascertained or future goods\u2019 \u201d; and that, \u201cas to such contracts, the statute (the Uniform Sales Act of Michigan, where the contract was entered into and performed) provides among other things, and in effect, that <em>unless a different intention appears, </em>where the delivery terms are F. O. B., title passes when the property involved is delivered free on board.\u201d Counsel then cites section 19, rule 4(1), Uniform Sales Act, Michigan Laws of 1913, No. 100, p. 148, 3 Compiled Laws of Michigan 1915, p. 4211, \u00a7 11850, reading as follows: \u201cWhere there is a contract to sell unascertained or future goods by description, and goods of that description and in a deliverable state are unconditionally appropriated to the contract, either by the seller with the assent of the buyer, or by the buyer with the assent of the seller, the property in the goods thereupon passes to the buyer. Such assent may be expressed or implied, and may be given either before or after the appropriation is made.\u201d</p>\n<p id=\"AA9\">After all, the actual, intent of the parties must be determined from the terms of the contract, the conduct of the part\u2019es, and all the circumstances of the case. The contract here involved required the seller to saw and pile lumber of the required dimensions. When the lumber was sufficiently dry, orders were \u201cto be given for shipment\u201d hy the purchaser. Whereupon it became the duty of the seller to put the lumber on board cars at Manistique, when the title would pass from the seller to the buyer. United States v. Andrews, 207 U. S. 229, 28 S. Ct. 100, 52 L. Ed. 185; Yockey v. Norn, 101 Mich. 193, 60 N. W. 685, 26 L. R. A. 145; Dow Chemical Co. v. Chemical Works, 208 Mich. 157, 175 N. W. 269, 14 A. L. R. 1200.</p>\n<p id=\"b910-6\">In the event of a failure of the purchaser to order shipment when the lumber became sufficiently dry, the contract required settlement to be made by the purchaser on the estimate of the lumber in piles on the seller\u2019s premises, and the piles then were required to be \u201cmarked up\u201d; that is, marked with appellant\u2019s name. Undoubtedly title to lumber thus settled for and marked would pass to the purchaser, but this did not occur, because no lumber was settled for in 1920, nor was any shipped in 1920. Lumber was sawed and piled during the year, and Mr. Parr, president and general manager of the appellant company, \u201cmade inspection of the lumber covered by the contract from time to time. He made an inspection on or immediately before December 31, 1920. In this inspection he found that the lumber purchased under the contract * * * had been placed in pile and was marked in accordance with the trade custom as.being sold to the Brown Lumber Company.\u201d It will be observed that the purpose and extent of this inspection is left to conjecture. Manifestly we may not assume that the inspection went further than the ascertainment of the quality of the lumber and the manner in which it had been sawed. Certainly there is nothing to indicate any waiver on the part of the seller of the requirement that lumber not seasonably ordered should be settled for on estimate. It is, we think, plain that there was no transfer of title by the mere inspection of piled lumber and the notation on the piles that it had been sold to appellant. That the parties did not understand that it had been <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"883\">*883</page-number>\u201cunconditionally appropriated to the contract\u201d is manifest from what followed.</p>\n<p id=\"b911-4\">Nothing further was done until December 30th, when appellant requested \u201ca blanket invoice for the box lumber <em>that we have on order from you.\u201d* </em>(Italics ours.) The purpose of this request was stated to be that appellant wished \u201cto have an invoice as a mat\" ter of record\u201d so that <em>its books might disclose </em>\u201ca loss of $10.00 per M on this stuff.\u201d The request closed with the statement that \u201cthis blanket invoice should be dated not later than December 31st, 1920.\u201d The invoice was not forthcoming until January 5,1921, but it was postdated as of December 23,1920.</p>\n<p id=\"b911-5\">On February 26, 1921, the, lime company in a communication addressed to appellant, and notwithstanding the invoice, said: \u201cAttached you will find estimate of lumber in pile cut in the months of July, August and September;\u201d that the lime company had theretofore \u201cwithheld asking for settlement on <em>any </em>of this lumber\u201d; that the lime company needed funds, and would be \u201cobliged if you would send us trade acceptances to the amount of $15,000.00 to be made in amounts of $2,500.-00 each. <em>Lumber to cover to be marked up with your name. </em>(Italics ours.) In our view, this communication demonstrates that the seller still regarded the title to the lumber as not having passed to the purchaser. The words, \u201clumber to cover to be marked up with your name,\u201d are inconsistent with any other theory. In other words, the lime company recognized that the title to this lumber had not passed, and proposed that, to the extent that appellant would comply with the terms of the contract requiring it to \u201csettle for on estimate,\u201d lumber to cover would be marked up with appellant\u2019s name, when title to that lumber would thereupon pass to appellant. It does not even appear that this request of February 26,1921, of the lime company, was productive of any payments by appellant, but it does appear that \u201cin August, 1921, petitioner (appellant) prevailed upon the White Marble Lime Company to adjust the contract price to $16.25 per M ft. of lumber,\u201d and that all the shipments from lumber in pile on December 31, 1920, were settled on that basis. In other words, all of the lumber covered by the invoice of December 23, 1920, on which appellant \u201cput through\u201d a loss of $10 per thousand on its books, on the theory that it was to pay $35 per thousand for it, was settled for on the basis of $16.25 per thousand; so that there was, in fact, no loss at all.</p>\n<p id=\"b911-6\">Decision affirmed, with costs.</p>\n<p id=\"b911-7\">Affirmed.</p>\n</opinion>\n</casebody>\n",
