This action was considered on the briefs and oral arguments of the parties. The court has afforded the issues full consideration and has determined that they do not warrant a published opinion. <em>See </em>D.C. C\u00ede. R. 36(d). It is</p>\n<p id=\"b44-6\">ORDERED AND ADJUDGED that the order of the United States District Court for the District of Columbia be affirmed.</p>\n<p id=\"b44-7\">Anthony Maurice Suggs was found guilty after a jury trial of one count of conspiracy to distribute and possess with intent to distribute one kilogram of PCP (Phencyclidine) and one count of unlawful possession with intent to distribute one kilogram or more of PCP. <em>See United States v. Suggs, </em>146 F.Supp.3d 151, 154-155 (D.D.C. 2015). We affirmed his conviction. <em>See United States v. Ernest Glover, </em>681 F.3d 411, 416 (D.C. Cir. 2012).</p>\n<p id=\"b44-8\">The following year; we reversed convictions in two cases arising out of the same criminal conspiracy. First, in <em>United States v. Lonnell Glover, </em>736 F.3d 509 (D.C. Cir. 2013), this court held that evidence obtained from an audio recording device (commonly referred to as a \u201cbug\u201d) placed in Lonnell Glover\u2019s truck should have been suppressed because the warrant for such electronic monitoring was issued by a judge in the District of Columbia, but the bug was attached to the truck in Maryland. <em>See id, </em>at 512-516.</p>\n<p id=\"b44-9\">Second, in <em>United States v. Hampton, </em>718 F.3d 978 (D.C. Cir. 2013), this court held that FBI Agent John Bevington\u2019s trial testimony exceeded the permissible bounds of lay witness opinion testimony under Federal Rule of Evidence 701, <em>see id. </em>at 983. Specifically, Agent Bevington improperly offered interpretations of evidence to the jury that depended upon and reflected his knowledge of the entire investigation, even though only a small portion of that underlying information was presented to the jury. <em>Id, </em>at 982-983. That informational imbalance between Agent Bevington and the jury left the jury without any practicable \u201cway of verifying his inferences or of independently reaching its own interpretations\u201d of the evidence. <em>Id. </em>at 983.</p>\n<p id=\"b44-11\">Because evidence from the electronic monitoring of Glover\u2019s truck and testimony by Agent Bevington were both admitted in his case, Suggs filed a motion to overturn his conviction under 28 U.S.C. \u00a7 2255. Suggs argued that he was denied his Sixth Amendment right to effective counsel because his attorney failed to object to the admission of the \u201ctruck bug\u201d evidence, and raised only an initial, general objection to the admission of Agent Bevington\u2019s testimony without objecting to specific statements during the Agent\u2019s testimony. <em>Suggs, </em>146 F.Supp.3d at 159-161.</p>\n<p id=\"b44-12\">The district court ruled that the failure to challenge the \u201ctruck bug\u201d evidence constituted deficient performance, but that the failure to object to some of Agent Bevington\u2019s testimony did not constitute deficient performance, <em>Suggs, </em>146 F.Supp.3d at 159-161. The district court further concluded that any errors were not prejudicial because the overwhelming weight of properly admitted evidence supported Suggs\u2019 conviction. <em>Id. </em>at 161-164. The district court granted Suggs a certificate of appealability. <em>See </em>28 U.S.C. \u00a7 2253(c); <em>see also </em>Fed R. App. P. 22.</p>\n<p id=\"b44-13\">We review ineffective assistance of counsel claims <em>de novo. See, e.g., United States v. Stubblefield, </em>820 F.3d 445, 448 (D.C. Cir. 2016). Applying that standard, we hold <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"19\">*19</page-number>that Suggs has failed to demonstrate that any alleged deficiencies by trial counsel prejudiced his defense.</p>\n<p id=\"b45-5\">To establish constitutionally ineffective representation, Suggs must demonstrate both that \u201c(i) \u2018counsel\u2019s representation fell below an objective standard of reasonableness\u2019 and (ii) \u2018the deficient performance prejudiced the defense.\u2019 \u201d <em>United States v. Nwoye, </em>824 F.3d 1129, 1134 (D.C. Cir. 2016) (quoting <em>Strickland v. Washington, </em>466 U.S. 668, 687-688, 104 S.Ct. 2052, 80 L.Ed.2d 674 (1984)). We- can start our analysis with either prong, bypassing the question of deficient performance by counsel altogether if no prejudice has been shown. That is because the purpose of the constitutional inquiry \u201cis not to grade counsel\u2019s performance,\u201d but instead to determine if the defendant\u2019s right to a fair trial was denied. <em>Strickland, </em>466 U.S. at 697, 104 S.Ct. 2052; <em>see also United States v. Udo, </em>795 F.3d 24, 30 (D.C. Cir. 2015) (\u201cIf the defendant fails to demonstrate prejudice, we may affirm the conviction without deciding whether counsel\u2019s performance was deficient.\u201d).</p>\n<p id=\"b45-6\">Prejudice exists when there is a \u201creasonable probability that, but for counsel\u2019s unprofessional errors, the result of the proceeding would have been different.\u201d <em>Strickland, </em>466 U.S. at 694, 104 S.Ct. 2052. A \u201creasonable probability\u201d is less than a preponderance, but is a \u201cprobability sufficient to undermine confidence in the outcome.\u201d <em>Idr, see also id. </em>(\u201cThe result of a proceeding can be rendered unreliable, and hence the proceeding itself unfair, even if the errors of counsel cannot be shown by a preponderance of the evidence to have determined the outcome.\u201d).</p>\n<p id=\"b45-7\">The problem for Suggs is that, even subtracting out the \u201ctruck bug\u201d evidence and the arguably impermissible portions of Agent Bevington\u2019s testimony, a solid wall of evidence demonstrating Suggs\u2019 guilt remains, including:</p>\n<blockquote id=\"b45-9\">(1) A controlled buy of PCP from Suggs by a government cooperator, <em>Suggs, </em>146 F.Supp,3d at 163;</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b45-10\">(2) A controlled buy of PCP by a cooperator ft\u2019om one of Suggs\u2019 alleged co-conspirators during which the alleged co-conspirator told the cooperator that he needed to make a call. The call was to Suggs, as confirmed by pen register evidence, <em>id. </em>at 161;</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b45-11\">(3) At least two calls between Suggs and an alleged co-conspirator that led to video surveillance of meetings between the two later on the same day, <em>id. </em>at 163; and</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b45-12\">(4) A call from Suggs\u2019 girlfriend about a strong odor emanating from their house, which led to a search warrant that uncovered thirteen bottles of PCP weighing 7.7 kilograms, a bucket that tested positive for PCP residue, air fresheners, a measuring cup, a funnel, $7,000 cash in Suggs\u2019 jacket, and a bank withdrawal receipt confirming that the cash was from Suggs\u2019 account, <em>id. </em>at 163-164,167.</blockquote>\n<p id=\"b45-13\">That evidence by itself convincingly supports the jury\u2019s determination that Suggs participated in a conspiracy to distribute and possess at least one kilogram of PCP, and unlawfully possessed with intent to distribute at least one kilogram of PCP. Accordingly, even assuming the performance of Suggs\u2019 counsel was deficient, Suggs\u2019 defense was not prejudiced by the failure to object to the truck bug evidence or Agent Bevington\u2019s testimony.</p>\n<p id=\"b45-14\">For those reasons, we affirm the district court\u2019s denial of Suggs\u2019 petition challenging his conviction under 28 U.S.C. \u00a7 2255.</p>\n<p id=\"b45-15\">Pursuant to D.C. Circuit Rule 36, this disposition will not be published. The Clerk is directed to withhold issuance of the mandate herein until seven days after resolution of any timely petition for re<page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"20\">*20</page-number>hearing or rehearing en banc. <em>See </em>Fed. R. Aff. P. 41(b); D.C. Cir. R. 41(a)(1).</p>\n</opinion>\n</casebody>\n",
