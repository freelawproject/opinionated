R. App. P. 36; D.C. Cir. R. 36(d). It is</p>\n<p id=\"b34-6\">ORDERED and ADJUDGED that the judgment of the District Court be AFFIRMED.</p>\n<p id=\"b34-7\">Appellant Ricky Nelson Page appeals from the District Court\u2019s denial of his motion for reversal of the January 9, 2014, decision by an Administrative Law Judge denying Page\u2019s applications for supplemental security income and disability insurance benefits.</p>\n<p id=\"b34-8\">An ALJ, tasked with evaluating a claim of disability, must conduct a five-step inquiry to determine if an individual is disabled as defined in 20 C.F.R. \u00a7 404.1506. First, the individual must show that he is not presently engaged in \u201csubstantial gainful activity.\u201d 20 C.F.R. \u00a7 404.1520(a)(4)(i). Second, the ALJ must determine whether the individual has a \u201csevere impairment\u201d that \u201csignificantly limits\u201d his \u201cability to do basic work activities\u201d for no less than 12 months. <em>Id. </em>\u00a7\u00a7 404.1520(a)(4)(ii), 404.1520(c), 404.1509. Third, the ALJ must determine whether the individual\u2019s impairment \u201cmeets or equals\u201d an impairment listed in the regulations. <em>Id. </em>\u00a7\u00a7 404.1520(a)(4)(iii), 404.1520(d). Fourth, the individual must demonstrate that he is incapable of performing his previous work. <em>Id. </em>\u00a7\u00a7 404.1520(a)(4)(iv), 404.1520(f). Fifth and finally, the ALJ must determine whether the individual \u201ccan make an adjustment to other work,\u201d considering his age, education, past work experience, and residual functional capacity. <em>Id. </em>\u00a7\u00a7 404.1520(a)(4)(v), 404.1520(g). If, at the end of the analysis, the ALJ finds that the individual can work, the ALJ will also find that the claimant is not disabled. <em>See id. </em>\u00a7\u00a7 404.1520(a)(4)(v), 404.1520(g).</p>\n<p id=\"b34-10\">Here, in a detailed analysis, the ALJ found \u2014 at step five of the analysis \u2014 that Page was not disabled within the meaning of the Social Security Act because Page could make an adjustment to work other than the work that Page had done in the past. In reaching that decision, the ALJ considered Page\u2019s testimony, Page\u2019s medical records, information about Page\u2019s work activities, and the opinions of medical professionals. After reviewing that evidence, the ALJ found that Page was limited by several impairments, including major depressive disorder, anxiety disorder, and post-traumatic stress disorder. Nevertheless, the ALJ found that Page retained the ability to perform a range of unskilled work involving simple, routine tasks; occasional social interactions; simple decision-making; and limited stress. Because a vocational expert confirmed that even with those restrictions, a person of Page\u2019s age, education, and work experience, and residual functional capacity could perform a number of jobs that were abundant in the economy, the ALJ found that Page was not entitled to supplemental security income and disability insurance benefits.</p>\n<p id=\"b34-11\">Page then appealed to the Social Security Administration\u2019s Appeals Council. But the Appeals Council denied Page\u2019s request for review. Therefore, the ALJ\u2019s decision is the final decision of the Commissioner of the Social Security Administration in this case. Page sought review of that decision <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"9\">*9</page-number>in the District Court. <em>See </em>42 U.S.C. \u00a7\u00a7 405(g), 1383(c)(3). The District Court denied Page\u2019s motion for reversal of the Commissioner\u2019s decision. Page now appeals to this Court.</p>\n<p id=\"b35-5\">We review the District Court\u2019s denial of Page\u2019s motion \u201cde novo, as if the agency\u2019s decision had been appealed to this court directly.\u201d <em>Jones v. Astrue, </em>647 F.3d 350, 355 (D.C. Cir. 2011) (internal quotation marks omitted). In so doing, we consider whether the decision of the Commissioner of the Social Security Administration is \u201cbased on substantial evidence in the record and correctly applies the relevant legal standards.\u201d <em>Butler v. Barnhart, </em>353 F.3d 992, 999 (D.C. Cir. 2004); <em>see also </em>42 U.S.C. \u00a7 405(g). Substantial-evidence review is deferential to the agency fact-finder, requiring \u201csuch relevant evidence as a reasonable mind might accept as adequate to support a conclusion.\u201d <em>Pierce v. Underwood, </em>487 U.S. 552, 565, 108 S.Ct. 2541, 101 L.Ed.2d 490 (1988) (internal quotation marks omitted). Because disability cases of this sort are so fact-intensive and fact-dependent, the standard of review poses a high bar to clear in order to overturn the agency\u2019s decision.</p>\n<p id=\"b35-6\">Page challenges the Commissioner\u2019s final decision on two grounds. Neither argument is convincing.</p>\n<p id=\"b35-7\"><em>First, </em>Page contends that the ALJ misapplied the legal standards for medical opinion evidence because the ALJ did not defer to the opinion of Page\u2019s treating physician \u2014 Dr. Podell \u2014 regarding Page\u2019s ability to work. As this Court has explained in the past, \u201c[bjecause a claimant\u2019s treating physicians have great familiarity with [his] condition, their reports must be accorded substantial weight.\u201d <em>Butler, </em>353 F.3d at 1003 (quoting <em>Williams v. Shalala, </em>997 F.2d 1494, 1498 (D.C. Cir. 1993)); <em>see also </em>20 C.F.R. \u00a7\u00a7 416.927(c)(2), 404.1527(c)(2). An \u201cALJ who rejects the opinion of a treating physician\u201d must \u201cexplain his reasons for doing so.\u201d <em>Jones, </em>647 F.3d at 355 (internal quotation marks omitted).</p>\n<p id=\"b35-9\">The ALJ in this case satisfied the legal standards for rejecting Dr. Podell\u2019s opinion. As the ALJ explained, substantial evidence contradicted Dr. Podell\u2019s bottom-line opinion that Page is unable to work. Dr. Podell\u2019s treatment records indicated that Page had a \u201cmedium or mild\u201d global assessment of functioning score and \u201cgenerally normal mental status examinations.\u201d J.A. 16. Dr. Podell\u2019s own treatment notes also stated that Page\u2019s condition was consistently improving. Most notably, Dr. Po-dell had stated in a separate assessment that Page was capable of \u201clow stress\u201d work. <em>Id. </em>at 243. Similarly, multiple State agency psychologists found that Page could work so long as Page was not required to perform a stressful job. Thus, as the ALJ concluded, Dr. Podell\u2019s opinion that Page is unable to work was \u201coverly drastic.\u201d <em>Id. </em>at 16. Because Dr. Podell\u2019s opinion that Page is unable to work was contradicted by substantial evidence in the record (including Dr. Podell\u2019s own records), and because the ALJ explained why he chose not to credit Dr. Page\u2019s opinion, the ALJ adhered to the relevant legal standards in evaluating the medical opinion evidence in Page\u2019s case.</p>\n<p id=\"b35-10\"><em>Second, </em>Page argues that the ALJ failed to properly' evaluate the credibility of Page\u2019s testimony about his symptoms. Pursuant to Social Security Administration policy statements, an ALJ must engage in a two-step process to assess the credibility of a claimant\u2019s evaluation of the limiting effects of the claimant\u2019s symptoms. First, the ALJ must consider whether there is an <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"10\">*10</page-number>\u201cunderlying medically determinable\u201d impairment that \u201ccould reasonably be expected to produce\u201d the individual\u2019s \u201csymptoms.\u201d <em>See </em>Titles II &amp; XVI: Evaluation of Symptoms in Disability Claims: Assessing the Credibility of an Individual\u2019s Statements, Social Security Ruling 96-7p, 1996 WL 374186, at *2 (July 2, 1996).<footnotemark>1</footnotemark> Second, the ALJ \u201cmust evaluate the intensity, persistence, and limiting effects of the individual\u2019s symptoms to determine the extent to which the symptoms limit the individual\u2019s ability to do basic work activities.\u201d <em>Id, </em>At the second step, the ALJ evaluates the claimant\u2019s credibility regarding the alleged limiting effects of his symptoms \u201cbased on a consideration of the entire case record.\u201d <em>Id.</em></p>\n<p id=\"b36-4\">Because the ALJ found that Page\u2019s complaints were not consistent with the record, the ALJ did not credit Page\u2019s statements about the \u201cintensity, persistence and limiting effects\u201d of Page\u2019s symptoms. J.A. 14. In reaching that decision, the ALJ analyzed Page\u2019s treatment notes, activities, and work history, methodically and carefully noting inconsistencies between Page\u2019s testimony and the record. While the ALJ found that some of Page\u2019s testimony about his symptoms was consistent with the record, the ALJ found that other claimed symptoms were not fully supported by Page\u2019s doctors\u2019 treatment decisions and Page\u2019s activities. For example, Page claimed that he could not work due to blurred vision from his medications. But Page\u2019s medical treatment records noted that Page consistently denied experiencing any side effects from his medications. Therefore, the ALJ decided not to credit Page\u2019s testimony about his blurred vision. Similarly, Page claimed that he had violent dreams and had once harmed his fianc\u00e9e in his sleep. But the ALJ observed that circumstances had changed since Page experienced violent dreams. Most notably, Page had begun receiving mental health treatment for his dreams. Page\u2019s medical records revealed that, following the start of Page\u2019s mental health treatment, Page slept better and had fewer dreams. Therefore, the ALJ decided not to credit Page\u2019s testimony about his trouble sleeping. The ALJ properly evaluated the credibility of Page\u2019s testimony about his symptoms.</p>\n<p id=\"b36-7\">In sum, the Social Security Administration\u2019s final decision is supported by substantial evidence in the record and was reached through the proper application of law. We therefore affirm the District\u2019s Court\u2019s judgment.</p>\n<p id=\"b36-8\">Pursuant to D.C. Circuit Rule 36, this disposition will not be published. The Clerk is directed to withhold issuance of the mandate herein until seven days after the resolution of any timely petition for rehearing or rehearing en banc. <em>See </em>Fed. R. App. P. 41(b); D.C. Cir. R. 41(a)(1).</p>\n<footnote label=\"1\">\n<p id=\"b36-5\">. Social Security Ruling 96-7p was rescinded by the Commissioner on March 16, 2016. See Titles II &amp; XVI: Evaluation of Symptoms in Disability Claims, Social Security Ruling 16-3p, 2016 WL 1119029 (March 16, 2016). However both parties agree that Social Security Ruling 96-7p applies here because it was still in effect at the time of the ALJ's decision in this case.</p>\n</footnote>\n</opinion>\n</casebody>\n",
