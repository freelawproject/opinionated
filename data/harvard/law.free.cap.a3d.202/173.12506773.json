Requester presents three issues for this Court's review: (1) whether the trial court erred by finding that the Request lacked specificity; (2) whether the trial court erred by finding that the content requested was exempt under the RTKL and the Criminal History Record Information Act (CHRIA);\n   <footnotemark>\n    2\n   </footnotemark>\n   and (3) whether the trial judge erred by failing to recuse himself.

By January 25, 2016 letter, the Borough submitted a response with references to the RTKL and an affidavit by\n   Borough Police Chief F. Richard Drumheller (Drumheller) (Affidavit).\n   <em>\n    See\n   </em>\n   O.R. Petition Ex. D. Requester did not supplement the record.

Specificity\n   </strong>\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-17\">\n   Requester first argues that the trial court erred by finding the Request insufficiently specific under the RTKL. Section 703 of the RTKL requires that \"[a] written request should identify or describe the records sought with sufficient specificity to enable the agency to ascertain which records are being requested ....\" 65 P.S. \u00a7 67.703.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-18\">\n   \"When considering a challenge to the specificity of a request under Section 703 of the RTKL, this Court employs a three-part balancing test[.]\"\n   <em>\n    Pa.

FOF at 10. However, after review, this Court holds that the Request clearly identifies the subject matter of the request (Department activity and Requester), the scope of records sought (video surveillance footage) and a specific timeframe (October 4, 2015 - a single day).\n   <em>\n    See\n   </em>\n   <em>\n    Easton Area Sch.

D (Affidavit) \u00b6 11.\n   <footnotemark>\n    10\n   </footnotemark>\n   Thus, \"the [R]equest was obviously sufficiently specific because the [Borough] has already identified potential records included within the [R]equest.\"\n   <em>\n    Easton Area Sch.

Exemptions\n   </strong>\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-21\">\n   Requester next argues that the trial court erred in finding that the information requested was exempt under the RTKL and CHRIA.

He explained that the police station consists of areas that, for security reasons, are neither open nor accessible to the general public. He explained that the doors to the secure areas are always locked and can only be opened by officers and detectives with specifically-programmed key access cards.\n   <footnotemark>\n    12\n   </footnotemark>\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-28\">\n   Drumheller further reported that the entire Department is under video surveillance recorded by approximately 13 cameras located \"virtually everywhere but the bathroom.\" O.R. Item 5, Statement, Notes of Testimony, September 16, 2016 (N.T.) at 20. Drumheller explained that the cameras cover the Department's entrances, including the sally port entrance where detainees are taken from patrol cars to the cellblocks, the public area, the hallways and\n   the cellblocks. He related that the cameras' live feeds are monitored 24 hours a day, 7 days a week by both dispatch and the detective division.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-29\">\n   Drumheller added that the Department does not advertise the cameras' specific positions. Drumheller specified that to do so could compromise:\n  </p>\n  <blockquote id=\"p-30\">\n   A. Security, safety, and, quite frankly, you would[ ] reveal information that would be damaging -- cameras have blind spots to them in locations. We wouldn't want anybody to know that they could stand here and not be on camera or that type of event. So we don't advertise that.\n  </blockquote>\n  <blockquote id=\"p-31\">\n   Q. Do you believe there would be a risk to the officers if the general public were aware of the location of the cameras and the camera angles within the [Department]?\n  </blockquote>\n  <blockquote id=\"p-32\">\n   A. Absolutely.\n  </blockquote>\n  <blockquote id=\"p-33\">\n   Q. And do you believe there would be safety issues for detainees within the [Department] if the general public were to know the position and blind spots of those cameras?\n  </blockquote>\n  <blockquote id=\"p-34\">\n   A. Yes. And I reference that to [sic] recently we had a prisoner attempt to hang [him/herself], and we managed to catch that on camera and get [him/her] help before [he/she] complete [sic] that.\n  </blockquote>\n  <p id=\"p-35\">\n   N.T. at 18-19.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-36\">\n   Further, Drumheller described the safety concerns inherent in allowing the public access to view the Department's transport procedures:\n  </p>\n  <blockquote id=\"p-37\">\n   A. Well, for me personally, that's the most paralyzing thought of all this, because we have a strict policy on no guns in the cellblock, because we believe that with the cameras, that you stand a better chance of not having a weapon in the cellblock, the same reason they don't like weapons in court. One of the things that they would be able to do is they would be able to watch our movement inside the sally port. They would be able to see where we locked our weapons. They would be able to see how we lock our weapons. They would be able to see ... where we keep the electronic opening device for the door. They would virtually have access to everything by being able to review the video and see our procedures as we locked up somebody.\n  </blockquote>\n  <blockquote id=\"p-38\">\n   Q. And by the general public having access to everything, as you just noted, including the procedures, do you believe that that would create a substantial risk of harm to the officers, the detainees, and anyone else within that building?\n  </blockquote>\n  <blockquote id=\"p-39\">\n   A. I believe that's an understatement, but yes. I would be very fearful of that.\n  </blockquote>\n  <p id=\"p-40\">\n   N.T. at 21-22.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-41\">\n   Drumheller emphasized that public access to view the Department's transport procedures would create a real risk of detainees being better equipped to escape from the Department:\n  </p>\n  <blockquote id=\"p-42\">\n   Q. Would the camera images also capture not only the areas of ingress to the [Department] but areas of being able to exit the [Department]?\n  </blockquote>\n  <blockquote id=\"p-43\">\n   A. ... Our hallways are littered with doors and stuff like that, and if you understand which [ ] they are [sic], you'll get to them. But if you just ran loose, like you were trying to escape the building, the likelihood of you catching the right door to be able to get yourself out of the building would be minimal. However, if you had advance knowledge of that, you'd have access to move within the [Department] at your leisure.\n  </blockquote>\n  <blockquote id=\"p-44\">\n   Q. Does the video capture, for example, if a detainee is brought into a holding cell, where the keys are maintained?\n  </blockquote>\n  <blockquote id=\"p-45\">\n   A. Yes.\n  </blockquote>\n  <blockquote id=\"p-46\">\n   ....\n  </blockquote>\n  <blockquote id=\"p-47\">\n   Q. What risk could that cause?\n  </blockquote>\n  <blockquote id=\"p-48\">\n   A. Well, one of the things, the simple risk would be to escape, and one of the things, the easiest access, is my swipe card. Now, if this card was taken from me, in my case, they would have access to virtually the entire building. So it wouldn't take much to figure out, if you watched us coming in and out of the building all the time. And try to remember that you're capturing the whole - they're asking for the entire day's activity of our movement in the building. So you're going to see when officers come in. You're going to know when our shifts are. You're going to know who goes where within the building. You pretty much have the entire information in the entire building.\n  </blockquote>\n  <blockquote id=\"p-49\">\n   ....\n  </blockquote>\n  <blockquote id=\"p-50\">\n   Q. And in this day and age, we know certain things have happened out in the world, unfortunately, involving police officers. Is there concern about giving the general public a videotape of your police procedures?\n  </blockquote>\n  <blockquote id=\"p-51\">\n   A.

FOF at 9-10. However, the record is clear that the Borough failed to prove that the footage at issue was more than merely connected to Requester's\n   criminal investigation.

Section 67A02(a) of the Judicial Code states that the new provisions and \"not the [RTKL], shall apply to any audio recording or video recording made by a law enforcement agency.\" 42 Pa.C.S. \u00a7 67A02(a). Section 67A02(b) of the Judicial Code provides: \"\n    <strong>\n     Nothing in this chapter nor the\n    </strong>\n    [\n    <strong>\n     RTKL\n    </strong>\n    ]\n    <strong>\n     shall establish a right to production of an audio recording or video recording made inside a facility owned or operated by a law enforcement agency\n    </strong>\n    or to any communications between or within law enforcement agencies concerning an audio or video recording.\" 42 Pa.C.S. \u00a7 67A02(b) (emphasis added). Under Section 67A06 of the Judicial Code, appeals from a law enforcement agency's denial are not taken to the OOR, but to the court of common pleas. 42 Pa.C.S. \u00a7 67A06. Section 67A06(e) of the Judicial Code specifies:\n   </p>\n   <blockquote id=\"p-117\">\n    A court of common pleas with jurisdiction may grant a petition under this section, in whole or in part, and order the disclosure of the audio recording or video recording only if the court determines that the petitioner has established all of the following by a preponderance of the evidence:\n   </blockquote>\n   <blockquote id=\"p-118\">\n    (1) The request was not denied under [S]ection 67A04 [of the Judicial Code] (relating to law enforcement review) or the request was denied under section 67A04 and the court of common pleas with jurisdiction determines that the denial was arbitrary and capricious.\n   </blockquote>\n   <blockquote id=\"p-119\">\n    (2) The public interest in disclosure of the audio recording or video recording or the interest of the petitioner outweighs the interests of the Commonwealth, the law enforcement agency or an individual's interest in nondisclosure. In making a determination under this paragraph, the court of common pleas may consider the public's interest in understanding how law enforcement officers interact with the public, the interests of crime victims, law enforcement and others with respect to safety and privacy and the resources available to review and disclose the audio recording or video recording.\n   </blockquote>\n   <p id=\"p-120\">\n    42 Pa.C.S. \u00a7 67A06(e).
