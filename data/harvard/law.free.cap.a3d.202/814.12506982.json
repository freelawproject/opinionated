Sivick (Sivick) petitions for review of the State Ethics Commission's (Commission) February 1, 2018 final adjudication and order,\n   <footnotemark>\n    1\n   </footnotemark>\n   wherein the Commission concluded that Sivick violated Section 1103(a) of the Public Official and Employee Ethics Act\n   <footnotemark>\n    2\n   </footnotemark>\n   (Ethics Act), Section 1104(d) of the Ethics Act,\n   <footnotemark>\n    3\n   </footnotemark>\n   and Section 1105(a) and 1105(b)(5) of the Ethics Act,\n   <footnotemark>\n    4\n   </footnotemark>\n   and ordered Sivick to make restitution in the amount of $ 30,000.00 and amend his Statements of Financial Interests (SFI) for the years 2011 and 2014. Sivick presents four issues for this Court's review: (1) whether the Commission erred by ruling that Sivick violated Section 1103(a) of the Ethics Act when, as Lehman Township\n   <footnotemark>\n    5\n   </footnotemark>\n   (Township) Supervisor (Supervisor) and Public Works Director, he engaged in activity for the purpose of encouraging the Township to repeal its nepotism policy and hire his son, J. Justin Sivick (Sivick's Son); (2) whether Sivick's participation in verifying Township payroll records for Township employees, including Sivick's Son, constituted a prohibited conflict of interest in violation of Section 1103(a) of the Ethics Act; (3) whether Sivick violated Section 1105(a) and 1105(b)(5) of the Ethics Act when he omitted certain information in his 2011 and 2014 SFIs; and (4) whether the Commission erred by ordering restitution. After review, we affirm.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-10\">\n   The Township is a second class township with a three-member Board of Supervisors (Board). Sivick served as a Board member from January 1994 until December 2017, and as Board Chairman since 2004. Sivick has also held the full-time Roadmaster position since 1995. In 2005, the Board assigned him the additional responsibilities of Public Works Director. Other Supervisors during the subject time periods included Richard C. Vollmer (Vollmer), Robert H. Rohner (Rohner) and Paul D. Menditto (Menditto). Vollmer became a Supervisor on July 5, 2000 and, at the time of this proceeding, was serving his third term.\n   <footnotemark>\n    6\n   </footnotemark>\n   Vollmer has been Board Vice Chairman since January 2004. Rohner, who had been Township Secretary/Treasurer since 1995, became a Supervisor in January 2014. Menditto served as a Supervisor from January 2004 through January 2014, when he resigned\n   his position following his election as a Magisterial District Judge. Rohner replaced Menditto on the Board.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-11\">\n   In 2009, Menditto substantially upgraded the Township's existing 3-page employee pamphlet to an employee handbook (Handbook), which included detailed rules and regulations and contained a policy that prohibited the hiring of an individual if that person would supervise or be supervised by a member of the person's immediate family (Nepotism Policy).\n   <footnotemark>\n    7\n   </footnotemark>\n   The Board approved the Handbook, including the Nepotism Policy.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-12\">\n   The Township did not have a formal hiring process, and Sivick conducted all of the Township's hiring. In late 2012, Sivick verbally expressed to his fellow Supervisors in one-on-one discussions that he wanted the Township to employ his Son. During these conversations, Sivick and the other Supervisors acknowledged that the Nepotism Policy would need to be removed from the Handbook before Sivick's Son could be hired.\n   <footnotemark>\n    8\n   </footnotemark>\n   Menditto, in consultation with the Supervisors, including Sivick, revised the Handbook to remove the Nepotism Policy. On January 7, 2013, at a Township reorganizational meeting, Menditto moved to approve the \"employee benefits and information,\" that included the revised Handbook without the Nepotism Policy.\n   <footnotemark>\n    9\n   </footnotemark>\n   Vollmer seconded Menditto's motion, and it was approved. Although present at the meeting, Sivick abstained from voting on the revision as instructed by the Township's Solicitor. Despite the Board's general practice of preparing an errata sheet reflecting Handbook changes, Sivick told Menditto not to prepare an errata sheet, and no errata sheet was created.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-13\">\n   As Roadmaster, Sivick coordinated and scheduled training classes for Township road crew employees. On March 20, 2013, Rohner submitted a registration form on the Township's behalf enrolling six individuals in a traffic control flagger training course that the Pennsylvania Department of Transportation mandated for individuals with flagging duties. Although Sivick's Son had not yet applied for Township employment,\n   his name was among those included in the Township's flagger course enrollment form. The Township submitted payment of $ 300.00 reflecting a $ 50.00 enrollment fee for each enrollee. On the same date, Sivick issued a $ 50.00 check to the Township wherein the memo line read: \"Flagging Class.\" Reproduced Record (R.R.) at 172a.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-14\">\n   On June 3, 2013, Sivick's Son applied for Township employment in public works maintenance.\n   <footnotemark>\n    10\n   </footnotemark>\n   In early June 2013, Sivick again approached the Supervisors about hiring his Son. Although both Vollmer and Menditto admitted that they voted to approve Sivick's Son's employment at a June 2013 meeting,\n   <footnotemark>\n    11\n   </footnotemark>\n   June 2013 Township meeting minutes do not reflect an official Board vote approving Sivick's Son's hiring.\n   <footnotemark>\n    12\n   </footnotemark>\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-15\">\n   Sivick's Son began Township employment on June 10, 2013. His initial pay rate was $ 15.00 per hour for regular work hours and $ 22.50 for overtime. The starting pay rate was consistent with pay rates for new Township employees. In 2014, Sivick's Son's regular pay rate was $ 16.20 per hour and his overtime rate was $ 24.30. In 2015, his regular pay rate was $ 17.45 and his overtime rate was $ 26.18. In 2016, his regular pay rate was $ 18.20 and his overtime rate was $ 27.30.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-16\">\n   Township road crew employees completed time sheets, upon which they were paid. Sivick's duties included reviewing, verifying and signing the time sheets and forwarding them to the Township's administrative secretary and Secretary/Treasurer for additional review before paychecks were issued.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-17\">\n   The Township employed Sivick's Son for 81 pay periods from June 2, 2013 to July 9, 2016, during which time his gross earnings totalled $ 126,552.24 (he netted $ 87,949.36). The Township discharged Sivick's Son's on June 30, 2016.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-18\">\n   On November 15, 2015, the Commission's Investigative Division (Investigative Division) received a signed, sworn complaint wherein it was alleged that Sivick had violated the Ethics Act. On January 19, 2016, the Investigative Division initiated a preliminary inquiry and, thereafter, a full investigation, and notified Sivick accordingly. On September 13, 2016, the Investigative Division mailed Sivick an Investigative Complaint/Findings Report, to\n   which Sivick filed an answer on November 12, 2016. The parties filed a Stipulated Record in lieu of an evidentiary hearing and filed briefs. On February 1, 2018, the Commission issued its final adjudication, wherein it determined that Sivick violated the conflict of interest provisions of Section 1103(a) of the Ethics Act, that Sivick filed timely but deficient SFIs for calendar years 2011 and 2014 in violation of Section 1105(a) and 1105(b)(5) of the Ethics Act, and that Sivick violated Section 1104(d) of the Ethics Act because he received compensation from the Township when he did not have accurate and complete SFIs on file with the Township. Specifically, the Commission ruled:\n  </p>\n  <blockquote id=\"p-19\">\n   [Sivick] used the authority of his public positions for the private pecuniary benefit of his [S]on ... when he participated in discussions and actions of the Board to eliminate the Township's Nepotism Policy with the intent and for the purpose of having his [S]on hired as a Township road crew employee; when he discussed, recommended, lobbied, influenced, or sought the support of the Board to effectuate the hiring of his [S]on as a Township employee; and when he verified Township records enabling and/or otherwise directing the payment of salary/wage to his [S]on from public monies.\n  </blockquote>\n  <blockquote id=\"p-20\">\n   ....\n  </blockquote>\n  <blockquote id=\"p-21\">\n   [Sivick] used the authority of his public office as a Supervisor by participating in the aforesaid discussions as well as later discussions with his fellow Supervisors regarding the changes to the [Handbook] to remove the Nepotism Policy. [Sivick]'s discussions/actions to effectuate the removal of the Nepotism Policy - a policy that [Sivick] had voted to approve only a few years earlier - were undertaken with the specific intent, motivation, and purpose of enabling the hiring of [Sivick]'s [S]on ... by the Township. Although [Sivick] abstained from the January 7, 2013[ ] vote of the Board that approved the revised [Handbook], he had already used the authority of his office to effectuate the removal of the Nepotism Policy from the [Handbook] prior to the vote.\n  </blockquote>\n  <blockquote id=\"p-22\">\n   ....\n  </blockquote>\n  <blockquote id=\"p-23\">\n   [Sivick] used the authority of his public office as a Supervisor when he discussed, recommended, lobbied, influenced, or sought the support of the Board to effectuate the hiring of his [S]on as a Township employee. [Sivick] 'pled his case' to Vollmer about seeing his [S]on 'get a chance.' Fact Finding 35 d(2);\n   <em>\n    Stipulated Record\n   </em>\n   , at 75, lines 23-24. After the Nepotism Policy had been removed from the [Handbook], [Sivick] again asked Vollmer if it would be alright if he brought his [S]on in to be a Township employee. When Vollmer asked [Sivick] if [his Son] had qualifications for the Township position, [Sivick] responded affirmatively and informed Vollmer of his [S]on's qualifications.\n  </blockquote>\n  <p id=\"p-24\">\n   Commission Adj. at 20-21. Finally, the Commission held:\n  </p>\n  <blockquote id=\"p-25\">\n   [Sivick] used the authority of his public office when he used the actual power he had by being a Township Supervisor to access and influence his fellow Township Supervisors to effectuate both the elimination of the Township's Nepotism Policy and the hiring of [Sivick]'s [S]on. Given that the Nepotism Policy would have precluded the hiring of [Sivick]'s [S]on, and given that at least one of the Supervisors (Vollmer) raised concerns regarding hiring [Sivick]'s [S]on, it is clear that [Sivick's Son] would not have been hired as a Township employee but for [Sivick]'s use of the authority of his public office as a Supervisor to engage in discussions with and make recommendations\n   to his fellow Supervisors and to lobby/influence or seek the support of those Supervisors with regard to eliminating the Nepotism Policy and hiring his [S]on. But for being a Supervisor, [Sivick] would not have been in a position to engage in such communications and to exert such influence to effectuate the hiring of his [S]on. [Sivick] was consciously aware of the private pecuniary benefit his [S]on would receive if hired by the Township, and [Sivick]'s actions in getting the Nepotism Policy eliminated and his [S]on hired were steps to secure that private pecuniary benefit.\n  </blockquote>\n  <p id=\"p-26\">\n   <em>\n    Id.\n   </em>\n   at 21-22.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-27\">\n   The Commission ordered Sivick to pay $ 30,000.00 in restitution to the Commonwealth of Pennsylvania and to file complete and accurate SFIs for 2011 and 2014.

Section 1102 of the Ethics Act defines \"[c]onflict\" or \"conflict of interest\" as:\n  </p>\n  <blockquote id=\"p-35\">\n   <strong>\n    Use by a public official\n   </strong>\n   or public employee\n   <strong>\n    of the authority of his office or employment\n   </strong>\n   or any confidential information received through his holding public office or employment\n   <strong>\n    for the private pecuniary benefit of himself, a\n   </strong>\n   <strong>\n    member of his immediate family\n   </strong>\n   <sup>\n    <strong>\n     [\n    </strong>\n   </sup>\n   <footnotemark>\n    14\n   </footnotemark>\n   <sup>\n    <strong>\n     ]\n    </strong>\n   </sup>\n   or a business with which he or a member of his immediate family is associated.

In support, Sivick claims that he \"took no action whatsoever to move, second or vote during the Board's public January 2013 decision to remove the [N]epotism [P]olicy from the [Handbook].\" Sivick Br. at 14. He further asserts that with respect to his Son's hiring, he requested the Supervisors to vote on the hiring,\n   <footnotemark>\n    16\n   </footnotemark>\n   and he abstained from voting. In short, Sivick maintains that, rather than using the authority of his public office, he merely exercised his free speech rights under the First Amendment to the United States Constitution and\n   <em>\n    suggested\n   </em>\n   to his fellow Supervisors that the Township remove the Nepotism Policy and hire his Son.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-38\">\n   With respect to the\n   <em>\n    use\n   </em>\n   of the authority of office necessary to violate Section 1103(a) of the Ethics Act, the Pennsylvania Supreme Court has explained:\n  </p>\n  <blockquote id=\"p-39\">\n   The word 'use' is not defined in the Ethics Act. The dictionary definition of the noun 'use' is '[t]he act of using or putting to a purpose[,\n   <em>\n    e.g.\n   </em>\n   ,] the use of a car;' analogously, the definition of the verb 'use' is '1.

Instead, the totality of the circumstances make clear that Sivick violated Section 1103(a) of the Ethics Act when he took those actions.\n   <footnotemark>\n    23\n   </footnotemark>\n   Accordingly, the Commission properly determined that Sivick violated Section 1103(a) of the Ethics Act's conflict of interest prohibition.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-61\">\n   Sivick next contends that the Commission erred when it concluded that he committed a conflict of interest violation by verifying Township payroll records for Sivick's Son because there is no evidence that Sivick's Son acquired a pecuniary benefit to which he was not entitled and because Sivick's Son was a member of a class/subclass of employees subject to Sivick's supervision. Sivick argues that this Court has interpreted the Ethics Act to require pecuniary gain to be something to which the individual is not entitled, and the record is devoid of any such gain since there is no evidence that Sivick's Son failed to perform his employment duties.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-62\">\n   In support, Sivick first cites to\n   <em>\n    Kraines v.

In\n   <em>\n    Kraines\n   </em>\n   , this Court reversed the Commission's adjudication declaring that a county controller violated the Ethics Act's conflict of interest provisions when she signed payroll checks to her husband, a forensic pathologist who provided services to her county. This Court found that Kraines did not improperly use her office to gain pecuniary benefits to which her husband was not entitled because he had been performing autopsies for the county years before Kraines was county controller. In addition, Kraines had no role in the county coroner's decision to use her husband's services and had no involvement in the amount her husband and other pathologists were paid. This Court further explained: \"While Kraines approved payments via her stamped signature on [c]ounty checks to her husband for pathologist fees, such action in and of itself does not constitute an ethics violation as [Kraines' husband] was\n   <strong>\n    entitled\n   </strong>\n   to these fees.\"\n   <em>\n    <extracted-citation case-ids=\"11434743\" index=\"14\" url=\"https://cite.case.law/a2d/805/677/\">\n     Id.\n    </extracted-citation>\n   </em>\n   <extracted-citation case-ids=\"11434743\" index=\"14\" url=\"https://cite.case.law/a2d/805/677/\">\n    at 681\n   </extracted-citation>\n   (emphasis added).\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-63\">\n   Unlike in\n   <em>\n    Kraines\n   </em>\n   , where Kraines' husband had been performing county autopsies before Kraines was hired, Sivick initiated the improper scheme to have the Township's Nepotism Policy repealed and his Son hired, which directly resulted in the Township employing his Son and Sivick\n   approving his Son's payroll records. Thus,\n   <em>\n    Kraines\n   </em>\n   is inapposite.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-64\">\n   Sivick also contends that, because his Son's pecuniary gain was the salary his Son earned for performing Township work,\n   <em>\n    i.e.\n   </em>\n   , \"compensation provided by law[,]\" no conflict exists. Sivick relies on the language in Section 3(a) of the former Ethics Law, that: \"No public official or public employee shall use his public office ... to obtain financial gain\n   <strong>\n    other than compensation provided by law\n   </strong>\n   for himself, a member of his immediate family, or a business with which he is associated.\"\n   <em>\n    Formerly\n   </em>\n   65 P.S. \u00a7 403(a), Act of October 4, 1978, P.L. 883 (emphasis added).\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-65\">\n   In contrast, the current Ethics Act prohibits a public official from engaging in conduct constituting a conflict of interest, 65 Pa.C.S. \u00a7 1103(a), which is defined in part as using the authority of office \"for the\n   <strong>\n    private pecuniary benefit\n   </strong>\n   of himself, [or] a member of his immediate family ....\" 65 Pa.C.S. \u00a7 1102 (emphasis added). Therefore, the current Ethics Act's conflict of interest provision applicable here no longer uses the \"other than compensation provided by law\" language. Section 3(a) of the Ethics Law,\n   <em>\n    formerly\n   </em>\n   65 P.S. \u00a7 403(a).\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-66\">\n   Based on this distinction, the Commission contends that the use of official authority for any \"private pecuniary benefit,\" 65 Pa.C.S. \u00a7 1102, is a prohibited conflict of interest, even if the benefit is \"compensation provided by law[.]\"\n   <em>\n    Formerly\n   </em>\n   65 P.S. \u00a7 403.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-67\">\n   In response, Sivick argues that the \"other compensation provided by law\" language remains in Section 1101.1(a) of the Ethics Act, wherein the General Assembly declared \"that public office is a public trust and that any effort to realize personal financial gain through public office\n   <strong>\n    other than compensation provided by law\n   </strong>\n   is a violation of that trust.\" 65 Pa.C.S. \u00a7 1101.1(a) (emphasis added).

Cmwlth. 1996), this Court clearly stated that, given the Ethics Act's amendments, \"the current conflict of interest standard ... makes\n   <strong>\n    any private pecuniary gain to a public official a violation,\n    <em>\n     whether or not such compensation is otherwise provided for by law\n    </em>\n    .\n   </strong>\n   \" (Emphasis added).\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-69\">\n   Sivick's Son was hired as a direct result of Sivick using his official authority to change the Handbook to achieve that specific goal. Because the Township hired Sivick's Son as a direct consequence of Sivick's conduct, Sivick's participation in\n   approving his Son's payroll time sheets so as to obtain pecuniary benefit violated the Ethics Act's conflict of interest provision. Accordingly, Sivick's argument fails.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-70\">\n   Sivick also asserts that reviewing his Son's time sheets and forwarding them for payment did not violate the Ethics Act because\n  </p>\n  <blockquote id=\"p-71\">\n   [t]he definition of 'conflict of interest' does not include an action '\n   <em>\n    which affects to the same degree a class consisting of the general public or a subclass consisting of an industry, occupation or other group which includes the public official or public employee, a member of his immediate family or a business with which he or a member of his immediate family is associated.'\n   </em>\n   Section 1102 of the Ethics Act (emphasis added).\n  </blockquote>\n  <p id=\"p-72\">\n   <em>\n    Kraines\n   </em>\n   ,\n   <extracted-citation case-ids=\"11434743\" index=\"16\" url=\"https://cite.case.law/a2d/805/677/\">\n    805 A.2d at 682\n   </extracted-citation>\n   . The Commission rejected this argument, explaining:\n  </p>\n  <blockquote id=\"p-73\">\n   Although [Sivick] contends that the class/subclass exclusion to the definition of 'conflict' or 'conflict of interest' would be applicable to the aforesaid actions, that argument fails. The review of each individual employee's time[ ]sheets and the subsequent approval of that individual's payroll as part of the total payroll for Township employees would not fall under the class/subclass exclusion because the review and approval as to each employee would be separate and specific to that individual based upon his/her time[ ]sheet.\n  </blockquote>\n  <blockquote id=\"p-74\">\n   [Sivick's] use of the authority of his public positions to have the Nepotism Policy eliminated, to have his [S]on hired, and to sign time[ ]sheets and effectuate payments to his [S]on for hours of work claimed resulted in a private pecuniary benefit consisting of the compensation [his Son] received from the Township for a job he would not otherwise have held.\n  </blockquote>\n  <p id=\"p-75\">\n   Commission Adj. at 22. Sivick's actions were not broad conduct generally affecting a class - his employees. Instead, he reviewed each employee's individual time sheet presumably to consider whether it accurately reflected that employee's working hours. Thereafter, he issued approvals based on each such individual's time sheet. We discern no error in the Commission's analysis. Thus, Sivick's argument is unfounded.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-76\">\n   Sivick next argues that he did not violate Section 1105(a) and 1105(b)(5) of the Ethics Act when he omitted certain information from his 2011 and 2014 SFIs.

An elector filed a petition to set aside Benninghoff's nomination petition. On appeal, the Supreme Court concluded that although Benninghoff's receipt of a Commonwealth salary was not included, he substantially complied with the requirements of the Ethics Act.

Thus, the reference to \"a finding that a public official or public employee\n   <strong>\n    has obtained a financial gain in violation of this chapter\n   </strong>\n   \" in Section 1107(13) of the Ethics Act, 65 Pa.C.S. \u00a7 1107(13) (emphasis added), refers to a financial gain \"benefit[ting the public official or public employee], [or] a member of his immediate family[.]\" 65 Pa.C.S. \u00a7 1102. Any other interpretation would be illogical and result in an inconsistent application of the Ethics Act based solely upon who happened to benefit from the prohibited conduct. More importantly, this Court has already concluded that Sivick violated the Ethics Act by using the authority of his office for his Son's private pecuniary benefit. Had Sivick not engaged in the improper conduct, the Board would not have rescinded the Nepotism Policy or hired his Son. Because Sivick's Son's salary was a direct consequence of Sivick's use of his authority of office, it was \"financial gain in violation of [the Ethics Act]\" for which the Commission could order restitution. 65 Pa.C.S. \u00a7 1107(13). Accordingly, this Court rejects Sivick's argument.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-92\">\n   Next, Sivick claims that the Commission improperly ordered restitution be paid to the Commonwealth rather than to the Township. He argues \"the appropriate governmental body\" described in Section 1107(13) of the Ethics Act refers to the Township since the Township hired and paid Sivick's Son. Sivick further asserts that there is no evidence of any articulated loss to the Commonwealth. The Commission responds that this Court has consistently sanctioned the Commission's authority to order restitution and that restitution to the\n   <strong>\n    Commonwealth\n   </strong>\n   is appropriate because permitting such promotes \"confidence in government.\" Commission Br. at 38.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-93\">\n   The Pennsylvania Superior Court has explained that, in criminal matters, an offender \"has no standing to question contractual or subrogation rights which govern disposition of moneys paid via restitution to the victim.\"\n   <em>\n    Commonwealth v. Kerr\n   </em>\n   ,\n   <extracted-citation case-ids=\"187868\" index=\"22\" url=\"https://cite.case.law/pa-super/298/257/\">\n    298 Pa.Super. 257\n   </extracted-citation>\n   ,\n   <extracted-citation case-ids=\"187868\" index=\"23\" url=\"https://cite.case.law/pa-super/298/257/\">\n    444 A.2d 758\n   </extracted-citation>\n   , 761 (1982). In\n   <em>\n    Kerr\n   </em>\n   , the Superior Court rejected the offender's argument that a \"right of subrogation transforms the sentence [ordering restitution] into an order directing payment to one who was not the victim of the crime.\"\n   <em>\n    Id.\n   </em>\n   at 760-61. This Court finds\n   <em>\n    Kerr\n   </em>\n   instructive. In the instant matter, there is no question that Sivick's improper conduct resulted in Sivick's Son's receipt of significant pecuniary benefit. Thus, restitution is appropriate and, for reasons similar to those in\n   <em>\n    Kerr\n   </em>\n   , this Court concludes that Sivick may not seek to invalidate the Commission's order by challenging that restitution has been ordered to the wrong party.\n   <footnotemark>\n    30\n   </footnotemark>\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-94\">\n   For all of the above reasons, the Commission's final adjudication and order is affirmed.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-95\">\n   <em>\n    ORDER\n   </em>\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-96\">\n   AND NOW, this 3\n   <sup>\n    rd\n   </sup>\n   day of January, 2019, the State Ethics Commission's February 1, 2018 final adjudication and order is affirmed.\n  </p>\n  <footnote label=\"1\">\n   <p id=\"p-99\">\n    The order is Commission Order No. 1731.

As such, they merely accepted what was given to them and did not use their office for personal financial gain.\n   </blockquote>\n   <p id=\"p-139\">\n    <em>\n     McGuire\n    </em>\n    ,\n    <extracted-citation case-ids=\"11945891\" index=\"35\" url=\"https://cite.case.law/a2d/657/1346/\">\n     657 A.2d at 1352\n    </extracted-citation>\n    .\n   </p>\n  </footnote>\n  <footnote label=\"25\">\n   <p id=\"p-140\">\n    Right-to-Know Law, Act of February 14, 2008, P.L. 6, 65 P.S. \u00a7\u00a7 67.101 -67.3104.\n   </p>\n  </footnote>\n  <footnote label=\"26\">\n   <p id=\"p-141\">\n    Section 1105(b) of the Ethics Act provides:\n   </p>\n   <blockquote id=\"p-142\">\n    The [SFI] shall include the following information for the prior calendar year with regard to the person required to file the statement:\n   </blockquote>\n   <blockquote id=\"p-143\">\n    (1) Name, address and public position.\n   </blockquote>\n   <blockquote id=\"p-144\">\n    (2) Occupation or profession.\n   </blockquote>\n   <blockquote id=\"p-145\">\n    (3) Any direct or indirect interest in any real estate which was sold or leased to the Commonwealth, any of its agencies or political subdivisions, or purchased or leased from the Commonwealth, any of its agencies or political subdivisions, or which was the subject of any condemnation proceedings by the Commonwealth, any of its agencies or political subdivisions.\n   </blockquote>\n   <blockquote id=\"p-146\">\n    (4) The name and address of each creditor to whom is owed in excess of $ 6,500 and the interest rate thereon....\n   </blockquote>\n   <blockquote id=\"p-147\">\n    (5) The name and address of any direct or indirect source of income totaling in the aggregate $ 1,300 or more....\n   </blockquote>\n   <blockquote id=\"p-148\">\n    (6) The name and address of the source and the amount of any gift or gifts valued in the aggregate at $ 250 or more and the circumstances of each gift....\n   </blockquote>\n   <blockquote id=\"p-149\">\n    (7) The name and address of the source and the amount of any payment for or reimbursement of actual expenses for transportation and lodging or hospitality received in connection with public office or employment where such actual expenses for transportation and lodging or hospitality exceed $ 650 in an aggregate amount per year....\n   </blockquote>\n   <blockquote id=\"p-150\">\n    (8) Any office, directorship or employment of any nature whatsoever in any business entity.\n   </blockquote>\n   <blockquote id=\"p-151\">\n    (9) Any financial interest in any legal entity engaged in business for profit.\n   </blockquote>\n   <blockquote id=\"p-152\">\n    (10) The identity of any financial interest in a business with which the reporting person is or has been associated in the preceding calendar year which has been transferred to a member of the reporting person's immediate family.\n   </blockquote>\n   <p id=\"p-153\">\n    65 Pa.C.S. \u00a7 1105(b).\n   </p>\n  </footnote>\n  <footnote label=\"27\">\n   <p id=\"p-154\">\n    The Commission did\n    <strong>\n     not\n    </strong>\n    require disgorgement of Sivick's 2011 and 2014 compensation as a result of his deficient SFIs, but merely required that he amend them.\n   </p>\n  </footnote>\n  <footnote label=\"28\">\n   <p id=\"p-155\">\n    The Commission did not explain in its opinion why it chose restitution in the amount of $ 30,000.00.\n   </p>\n  </footnote>\n  <footnote label=\"29\">\n   <p id=\"p-156\">\n    Section 1102 of the Ethics Act defines \"public employee[,]\" in relevant part, as:\n   </p>\n   <blockquote id=\"p-157\">\n    Any individual employed by the Commonwealth or a political subdivision who is responsible for taking or recommending official action of a nonministerial nature with regard to:\n   </blockquote>\n   <blockquote id=\"p-158\">\n    (1) contracting or procurement;\n   </blockquote>\n   <blockquote id=\"p-159\">\n    (2) administering or monitoring grants or subsidies;\n   </blockquote>\n   <blockquote id=\"p-160\">\n    (3) planning or zoning;\n   </blockquote>\n   <blockquote id=\"p-161\">\n    (4) inspecting, licensing, regulating or auditing any person; or\n   </blockquote>\n   <blockquote id=\"p-162\">\n    (5) any other activity where the official action has an economic impact of greater than a de minimis nature on the interests of any person.\n   </blockquote>\n   <p id=\"p-163\">\n    65 Pa.C.S. \u00a7 1102.\n   </p>\n  </footnote>\n  <footnote label=\"30\">\n   <p id=\"p-164\">\n    This Court observes that the Township has not intervened to challenge the Commission's restitution order.\n   </p>\n  </footnote>\n </opinion>\n</casebody>\n"
