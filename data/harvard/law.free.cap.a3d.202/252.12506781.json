Jeffrey G. Oden (applicant) appeals the decision of the Vermont Board of Bar Examiners (Board) to deny his application to sit for the Vermont bar exam. We affirm.\n   <footnotemark>\n    *\n   </footnotemark>\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-10\">\n   \u00b6 2. In September 2017, applicant requested to sit for the February 2018 Vermont bar exam. Applicant had previously failed the Maryland bar exam six times before passing it in February 2014. The Board denied applicant's request based on Vermont Rule of Admission to the Bar 9(b)(4), which states, \"An Applicant who has failed the bar examination four times will not be permitted to sit for the [Uniform Bar Examination] in Vermont.\" Applicant appealed.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-11\">\n   \u00b6 3. Before considering the parties' arguments, we review the context for admission to the bar in Vermont. The Vermont Constitution grants this Court regulatory authority over the practice of law in Vermont. Vt. Const. ch. II, \u00a7 30 ; see also\n   <em>\n    In re Grundstein\n   </em>\n   ,\n   <extracted-citation index=\"0\" url=\"https://cite.case.law/citations/?q=2018%20VT%2010\">\n    2018 VT 10\n   </extracted-citation>\n   , \u00b6 23, --- Vt. ----,\n   <extracted-citation case-ids=\"12495831\" index=\"1\" url=\"https://cite.case.law/a3d/183/574/\">\n    183 A.3d 574\n   </extracted-citation>\n   . As an exercise of this authority, we have promulgated the Vermont Rules of Admission to the Bar, which are intended to ensure that attorneys granted admission to practice law in Vermont meet our standards for professional competence. V.R.A.B. 1 (\"The public interest is best served and protected and the integrity of the Bar of the Vermont Supreme Court is best maintained when applicants for admission are fairly, impartially, and thoroughly examined as to their professional competence as attorneys ....\"); see also\n   <em>\n    In re Conner\n   </em>\n   ,\n   <extracted-citation case-ids=\"3587930\" index=\"2\" url=\"https://cite.case.law/vt/181/555/\">\n    2006 VT 131\n   </extracted-citation>\n   , \u00b6 6,\n   <extracted-citation case-ids=\"3587930\" index=\"3\" url=\"https://cite.case.law/vt/181/555/\">\n    181 Vt. 555\n   </extracted-citation>\n   ,\n   <extracted-citation case-ids=\"3587930\" index=\"4\" url=\"https://cite.case.law/vt/181/555/\">\n    917 A.2d 442\n   </extracted-citation>\n   (mem.) (\"Courts maintain a strong interest in ensuring the competency\n   of legal practitioners within their jurisdiction, and to this end enjoy broad power to establish licensing standards for lawyers as officers of the court.\"). The rules also address an applicant's \"moral character and fitness\" to practice law. V.R.A.B. 1.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-12\">\n   \u00b6 4. We established the Board of Bar Examiners to assess professional competence. V.R.A.B. 1. We committed to the Board the \"duty to determine whether each Applicant has made the necessary showing of Minimal Professional Competence in accordance with these rules warranting the Applicant's admission to the Bar to engage in the practice of law.\" V.R.A.B. 1, 3(b). We established the Character and Fitness Committee to assess \"applicants' moral character and fitness.\" V.R.A.B. 1.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-13\">\n   \u00b6 5. One way an applicant may show sufficient professional competence is by obtaining a satisfactory score on the Uniform Bar Exam (UBE) administered in Vermont. V.R.A.B. 5(b), 9. However, an applicant may not sit for the UBE in Vermont if the applicant \"has failed the bar examination four times.\" V.R.A.B. 9(b)(4). The rules provide that \"[t]he four-attempt limitation may be waived upon a strong showing, to the Board's satisfaction, that the Applicant has substantially improved his or her Exam preparation and there is good cause warranting the requested waiver.\" V.R.A.B. 9(b)(4). According to the Board's Notes, the rules do \"not allow the Board to grant permission for an Applicant to sit a sixth time.\" Board's Notes-2017 Amendment, V.R.A.B. 9. The Board's Notes are advisory only.\n   <em>\n    Order Promulgating Amendments\n   </em>\n   , at 2 (June 1, 2017) (unpub. mem.), http://www.vermontjudiciary. org/sites/default/files/documents/PROMULGATED% 20Rules% 209% 28b% 29% 284% 29% 2012 % 28b% 29% 20and% 2013% 28d% 29% 20of% 20the% 20Rules% 20of% 20Admission.pdf [https:// perma.cc/QNY5-YM44].\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-14\">\n   \u00b6 6. The arguments in this appeal center on Rule 9(b)(4). Applicant contends that the term \"bar examination\" is ambiguous and that it refers to the UBE only, not to non-UBE bar exams. The bar examinations he attempted in Maryland were not UBE exams, so he argues the rule does not apply to him. He also claims the rule violates his due-process rights because the four-attempt limitation does not have a rational connection to his fitness or capacity to practice law. The Board counters that Rule 9(b)(4), by its plain language, refers to any bar examination, not only the UBE. The Board also defends the rule as rationally connected to the State's interest in protecting the public. Applicant did not request a waiver of the four-attempt limit, so there is no waiver decision to review, but both he and the Board address whether the Board has authority to grant a waiver after an applicant fails the bar exam five times.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-15\">\n   \u00b6 7. Our review is not deferential. We have granted the Board \"broad discretion in enforcing the rules of admission,\" and thus, generally, \"we will not set aside its decision unless there is strong showing of abuse of discretion ....\"\n   <em>\n    Ball v.

As with statutory construction, we look first to the rule's \"plain language,\" and we construe it \"as a whole, looking to the reason and spirit of the law and its consequences and effects to reach a fair and rational result.\"\n   <em>\n    In re Margaret Susan P.\n   </em>\n   ,\n   <extracted-citation case-ids=\"174286\" index=\"16\" url=\"https://cite.case.law/vt/169/252/#p262\">\n    169 Vt. 252\n   </extracted-citation>\n   , 262,\n   <extracted-citation case-ids=\"174286\" index=\"17\" url=\"https://cite.case.law/vt/169/252/#p262\">\n    733 A.2d 38\n   </extracted-citation>\n   , 46 (1999).\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-17\">\n   \u00b6 9. The Board correctly held that Rule 9(b)(4) does not permit an applicant to sit for the UBE in Vermont after the applicant has failed any state's bar examination or a combination of states' bar examinations at least four times. According to the rule, \"[a]n Applicant who has failed the bar examination four times will not be permitted to sit for the UBE in Vermont.\" V.R.A.B. 9(b)(4). There is nothing in the rule to indicate that the four-attempt restriction applies only to failures to pass the UBE, as opposed to bar examinations generally. Rule 13(a), which governs transfers of UBE scores, refers specifically to the \"UBE\" throughout and does not use the term \"bar examination.\" Thus, the rules use the term \"UBE\" when distinguishing between the UBE and bar examinations generally.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-18\">\n   \u00b6 10. Addressing applicant's due-process argument, we hold there is a rational connection between a four-attempt limit and our obligation to protect the public by ensuring professional competence.

Applicant may disagree with the policy-and not every state's bar has adopted such a restriction-but that does not make it irrational. See\n   <em>\n    Younger v. Colo.

We also consider the parties' arguments regarding whether the Board has authority to waive the four-attempt limitation for applicant, even though he has not requested a waiver. This is counter to our usual practice.

Rule 9(b)(4) does not limit the Board's authority to grant a waiver after the applicant has failed the bar examination at least five times. The rule itself contains no such limitation. The Board's Notes do: \"The [rule] does not allow the Board to grant permission for an Applicant to sit a sixth time.\" Board's Notes-2017 Amendment, V.R.A.B. 9. The Board's Notes, like Reporter's Notes for our court procedural rules, are helpful to interpretation. See, e.g.,\n   <em>\n    State v.

But they are advisory only.\n   <em>\n    Order Promulgating Amendments\n   </em>\n   , at 2. Where the Board's Notes explain a rule in a way that is inconsistent with the plain terms of the rule, we are free to disregard it. Here the Board's Notes impose a limitation that exists nowhere in the rule itself. We therefore hold that the Board does have authority to waive the four-attempt limitation, regardless of how many times the applicant has failed the bar exam, where the Board is satisfied that the applicant has shown substantial improvement in exam preparation and \"good cause warranting the requested waiver.\" V.R.A.B. 9(b)(4). If the Board finds this authority unwarranted, it may provide us with a recommended amendment to the rule that plainly limits its authority. See V.R.A.B. 3(c) (requiring Board to submit annual report to Court including \"rule changes considered or proposed by the Board\").\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-21\">\n   <em>\n    Affirmed\n   </em>\n   .\n  </p>\n  <footnote label=\"*\">\n   <p id=\"p-24\">\n    Applicant requested that we permit him to file supplemental briefing.
