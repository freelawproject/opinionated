That period of limitations is currently reflected in Maryland Code, Courts &amp; Judicial Proceedings Article (\"CJ\"), \u00a7 5-101. In recent decades, the question has arisen whether the period of limitations for such an action may be\n   extended to 12 years by converting a residential lease into a \"contract under seal\" so that it might be regarded as a \"specialty\" - a type of action for which another statute, CJ \u00a7 5-102, provides the longer period of limitations. In\n   <em>\n    Tipton v. Partner's Management Co\n   </em>\n   .,\n   <extracted-citation case-ids=\"1279911\" index=\"0\" url=\"https://cite.case.law/md/364/419/\">\n    364 Md. 419\n   </extracted-citation>\n   ,\n   <extracted-citation case-ids=\"1279911\" index=\"1\" url=\"https://cite.case.law/md/364/419/\">\n    773 A.2d 488\n   </extracted-citation>\n   (2001), this Court said \"no,\" but that answer was a partial one, as it was based on the\n   characteristics of the particular lease in that case. This is the sequel.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-12\">\n   In 2007, Petitioner Gregory Smith entered into a month-to-month lease for an apartment in Baltimore City. It is undisputed that he remained in the apartment only a few months before vacating it and ceasing to pay rent. The circumstances under which he left are in dispute. According to the landlord, Respondent Wakefield, LP (\"Wakefield\"), Mr. Smith was evicted for failure to pay rent in 2008; according to Mr. Smith, he gave appropriate notice for terminating the lease and left voluntarily.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-13\">\n   Seven years later, in 2015, Wakefield brought suit against Mr. Smith seeking to recover unpaid rent that it claimed Mr. Smith owed from 2008. When the case finally came to trial in 2018, Mr. Smith asserted that Wakefield had not filed suit within the three-year period of limitations in CJ \u00a7 5-101 that applies to actions seeking back rent. Wakefield argued that the lease qualified as a \"contract under seal\" and that the 12-year statute of limitations set forth in CJ \u00a7 5-102 applied. If Wakefield is correct, its suit was timely; if Mr. Smith is correct, it was not.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-14\">\n   The District Court sitting in Baltimore City agreed with Wakefield's argument and entered a judgment in its favor. On appeal, the Circuit Court for Baltimore City reached the same conclusion.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-15\">\n   We reverse. We hold that actions for back rent under residential leases are subject to a three-year period of limitations - as they have been for the past three centuries in Maryland - regardless of whether the lease includes provisions that purport to convert it into a contract under seal. To the extent that such provisions might be considered an agreement to modify the otherwise applicable period of limitations, such an agreement would be contrary to the State's landlord-tenant law and unreasonable under the particular circumstances of this case.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-16\">\n   <strong>\n    I\n   </strong>\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-17\">\n   <strong>\n    Background\n   </strong>\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-18\">\n   <strong>\n    <em>\n     A.

CJ \u00a7 5-101 and CJ \u00a7 5-102\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-20\">\n   Two statutes that set forth limitations periods are relevant to this case. First, the general statute of limitations for civil actions prescribes a three-year limitations period. It states:\n  </p>\n  <blockquote id=\"p-21\">\n   A civil action at law shall be filed within three years from the date it accrues unless another provision of the Code provides a different period of time within which an action shall be commenced.\n  </blockquote>\n  <p id=\"p-22\">\n   CJ \u00a7 5-101. Another statute provides a longer 12-year period of limitations for bringing certain types of actions classified as \"specialties.\" It states, in pertinent part:\n  </p>\n  <blockquote id=\"p-23\">\n   (a) An action on one of the following specialties shall be filed within 12 years after the cause of action accrues, or within 12 years from the date of the death of the last to die of the principal debtor or creditor, whichever is sooner:\n  </blockquote>\n  <blockquote id=\"p-24\">\n   ...\n  </blockquote>\n  <blockquote id=\"p-25\">\n   (5) Contract under seal ...\n  </blockquote>\n  <p id=\"p-26\">\n   CJ \u00a7 5-102(a)(5).\n   <footnotemark>\n    1\n   </footnotemark>\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-27\">\n   2. The\n   <em>\n    Tipton\n   </em>\n   Case\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-28\">\n   This Court considered the possible application of these two statutes of limitations\n   to an action seeking to recover back rent nearly two decades ago in\n   <em>\n    Tipton v. Partner's Management Co.\n   </em>\n   ,\n   <extracted-citation case-ids=\"1279911\" index=\"2\" url=\"https://cite.case.law/md/364/419/\">\n    364 Md. 419\n   </extracted-citation>\n   ,\n   <extracted-citation case-ids=\"1279911\" index=\"3\" url=\"https://cite.case.law/md/364/419/\">\n    773 A.2d 488\n   </extracted-citation>\n   (2001). That case concerned a residential lease. The landlord and tenant entered into a one-year lease beginning in January 1992. Just above the signature lines on the pre-printed lease form appeared the legend: \"IN WITNESS WHEREOF the parties hereto have\n   set their hands and\n   <em>\n    seals\n   </em>\n   the day and year first above written.\"\n   <extracted-citation case-ids=\"1279911\" index=\"4\" url=\"https://cite.case.law/md/364/419/\">\n    364 Md. at 423\n   </extracted-citation>\n   ,\n   <extracted-citation case-ids=\"1279911\" index=\"5\" url=\"https://cite.case.law/md/364/419/\">\n    773 A.2d 488\n   </extracted-citation>\n   (emphasis added). In addition, the word \"SEAL\" appeared in parentheses at the end of the signature line.\n   <em>\n    <extracted-citation case-ids=\"1279911\" index=\"6\" url=\"https://cite.case.law/md/364/419/\">\n     Id.\n    </extracted-citation>\n   </em>\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-29\">\n   The tenant was evicted from the property in November 1992 for failure to pay rent. The landlord sent the tenant a letter requesting payment, but did not take any legal action to collect the back rent for approximately seven years. In 1999, an agent of the landlord filed a complaint in the District Court. The tenant raised a defense that the suit had been filed well after the three-year period of limitations provided in CJ \u00a7 5-101. The landlord responded that the lease was a \"contract under seal\" and that, accordingly, the 12-year period of limitations provided in CJ \u00a7 5-102(a)(5) applied. The District Court, in a decision affirmed by the Circuit Court on appeal, agreed with the landlord and denied the tenant's motion to dismiss the complaint.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-30\">\n   This Court granted a writ of\n   <em>\n    certiorari\n   </em>\n   to consider whether the lease in question was a contract under seal -\n   <em>\n    i.e\n   </em>\n   ., a specialty - and, if so, whether application of the period of limitations under CJ \u00a7 5-102(a)(5) would be \"repugnant\" to certain provisions of the State landlord-tenant law providing protections to tenants in residential leases.\n   <extracted-citation case-ids=\"1279911\" index=\"7\" url=\"https://cite.case.law/md/364/419/\">\n    364 Md. at 422\n   </extracted-citation>\n   ,\n   <extracted-citation case-ids=\"1279911\" index=\"8\" url=\"https://cite.case.law/md/364/419/\">\n    773 A.2d 488\n   </extracted-citation>\n   . The Court ultimately concluded that the lease in question was not a \"contract under seal\" and, therefore, the 12-year period of limitations for specialty actions did not supersede the three-year period of limitations set forth in CJ \u00a7 5-101 in that case. The Court was careful to say that it was not resolving whether application of the 12-year period of limitations would conflict with provisions of the State landlord-tenant law.\n   <em>\n    <extracted-citation case-ids=\"1279911\" index=\"9\" url=\"https://cite.case.law/md/364/419/\">\n     Id.\n    </extracted-citation>\n   </em>\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-31\">\n   In reaching its disposition of the case, the Court observed that documents and instruments concerning the conveyancing of real property, such as leases, had long been executed \"under seal\" without any intention of creating a specialty action.\n   <extracted-citation case-ids=\"1279911\" index=\"10\" url=\"https://cite.case.law/md/364/419/\">\n    364 Md. at 425-34\n   </extracted-citation>\n   ,\n   <extracted-citation case-ids=\"1279911\" index=\"11\" url=\"https://cite.case.law/md/364/419/\">\n    773 A.2d 488\n   </extracted-citation>\n   . The Court also recounted, in elaborate detail, the legislative history of\n   CJ \u00a7 5-101 and observed that historically Maryland law had applied a three-year period of limitations to actions for back rent since colonial times. It noted that the enactment of CJ \u00a7 5-101 was a product of code revision and that there was no evidence that the General Assembly intended to change the longstanding period of limitations applicable to actions for back rent.\n   <em>\n    <extracted-citation case-ids=\"1279911\" index=\"12\" url=\"https://cite.case.law/md/364/419/\">\n     Id.\n    </extracted-citation>\n   </em>\n   <extracted-citation case-ids=\"1279911\" index=\"12\" url=\"https://cite.case.law/md/364/419/\">\n    at 434-45\n   </extracted-citation>\n   ,\n   <extracted-citation case-ids=\"1279911\" index=\"13\" url=\"https://cite.case.law/md/364/419/\">\n    773 A.2d 488\n   </extracted-citation>\n   . The Court stated that \"[w]ithout evidence of [legislative] intent, we will not ... hold that the statute of limitations was changed in respect to leases during a general recodification.\"\n   <em>\n    <extracted-citation case-ids=\"1279911\" index=\"14\" url=\"https://cite.case.law/md/364/419/\">\n     Id.\n    </extracted-citation>\n   </em>\n   <extracted-citation case-ids=\"1279911\" index=\"14\" url=\"https://cite.case.law/md/364/419/\">\n    at 446\n   </extracted-citation>\n   ,\n   <extracted-citation case-ids=\"1279911\" index=\"15\" url=\"https://cite.case.law/md/364/419/\">\n    773 A.2d 488\n   </extracted-citation>\n   .\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-32\">\n   The Court reiterated the results of its analysis in three separate sentences beginning \"We hold ....\" A difference in the language of one of those sentences may have significance for this case. First, at the outset of the opinion, the Court previewed what was to come:\n  </p>\n  <blockquote id=\"p-33\">\n   We hold that a residential lease agreement, even if the lease agreement has\n   the word seal affixed, is subject to the three-year limitation period enunciated in [ CJ \u00a7 5-101 ].\n  </blockquote>\n  <p id=\"p-34\">\n   <extracted-citation case-ids=\"1279911\" index=\"16\" url=\"https://cite.case.law/md/364/419/\">\n    364 Md. at 422\n   </extracted-citation>\n   ,\n   <extracted-citation case-ids=\"1279911\" index=\"17\" url=\"https://cite.case.law/md/364/419/\">\n    773 A.2d 488\n   </extracted-citation>\n   . In a footnote appended to that sentence, the Court observed that parties could agree to waive an otherwise applicable statute of limitations, but that a seal alone would not effect such a waiver.\n   <em>\n    <extracted-citation case-ids=\"1279911\" index=\"18\" url=\"https://cite.case.law/md/364/419/\">\n     Id.\n    </extracted-citation>\n   </em>\n   at 422 n.3,\n   <extracted-citation case-ids=\"1279911\" index=\"19\" url=\"https://cite.case.law/md/364/419/\">\n    773 A.2d 488\n   </extracted-citation>\n   .\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-35\">\n   Second, at the beginning of the \"Discussion\" section of the opinion, the Court again summarized its holding in similar language:\n  </p>\n  <blockquote id=\"p-36\">\n   We hold that actions for rent arrears under any kind of residential lease must be filed in compliance with [ CJ \u00a7 5-101 ].\n  </blockquote>\n  <p id=\"p-37\">\n   <extracted-citation case-ids=\"1279911\" index=\"20\" url=\"https://cite.case.law/md/364/419/\">\n    364 Md. at 425\n   </extracted-citation>\n   ,\n   <extracted-citation case-ids=\"1279911\" index=\"21\" url=\"https://cite.case.law/md/364/419/\">\n    773 A.2d 488\n   </extracted-citation>\n   . A footnote appended to that sentence cross-referenced the footnote concerning waiver that appeared with the prior statement of the holding.\n   <em>\n    <extracted-citation case-ids=\"1279911\" index=\"22\" url=\"https://cite.case.law/md/364/419/\">\n     Id.\n    </extracted-citation>\n   </em>\n   at 425 n.9,\n   <extracted-citation case-ids=\"1279911\" index=\"23\" url=\"https://cite.case.law/md/364/419/\">\n    773 A.2d 488\n   </extracted-citation>\n   .\n   <footnotemark>\n    2\n   </footnotemark>\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-38\">\n   Thus, the first two iterations of the holding in\n   <em>\n    Tipton\n   </em>\n   simply state that actions for back rent are subject to the three-year period of limitations in CJ \u00a7 5-101, that limitations periods may be waived, and that a seal does not suffice to effect such a waiver.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-39\">\n   Finally, in the concluding paragraph of the\n   <em>\n    Tipton\n   </em>\n   opinion, the Court reprised its holding in a passage that sets the stage for this case. The Court stated:\n  </p>\n  <blockquote id=\"p-40\">\n   We hold that claims for arrearages of rent under a residential lease, even a lease to which a seal is affixed, must be filed within the three-year limitation period unless the parties to the lease agree, in the body of the lease, that the lease is subject to the twelve-year limitation period of section 5-102.\n  </blockquote>\n  <p id=\"p-41\">\n   <extracted-citation case-ids=\"1279911\" index=\"24\" url=\"https://cite.case.law/md/364/419/\">\n    364 Md. at 445\n   </extracted-citation>\n   ,\n   <extracted-citation case-ids=\"1279911\" index=\"25\" url=\"https://cite.case.law/md/364/419/\">\n    773 A.2d 488\n   </extracted-citation>\n   . As is evident, the first clause of that sentence restated the Court's conclusion concerning the lease that was before it. Unlike the previous two instances, however, the Court did not qualify its holding with a reference to the possibility of waiver of limitations. Instead, the second clause of the sentence following the word \"unless\" addressed a somewhat distinct question: whether a lease could be converted into a contract under seal and thus be made subject to the 12-year period of limitations in CJ \u00a7 5-102. This seemed to predict the Court's opinion about a hypothetical lease that might appear in a future case - the kind of prediction that is often referred to as dicta, as it was unnecessary to the decision in\n   <em>\n    Tipton\n   </em>\n   .\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-42\">\n   The dicta in\n   <em>\n    Tipton\n   </em>\n   generates several questions. It is not clear how that dicta related to the Court's reasoning in the case before it. The dicta seems at odds with the Court's indication that it would require evidence of legislative intent to extend the statute of limitations applicable to actions for back rent. It may be that the Court intended the dicta to illustrate a situation in which the parties waived the otherwise applicable period of limitations of CJ \u00a7 5-101, although it is not clear why such a waiver would need to involve CJ \u00a7 5-102. In addition, there also remained the question that the Court in\n   <em>\n    Tipton\n   </em>\n   said that it was\n   <em>\n    not\n   </em>\n   answering - whether such an extension\n   of the period of limitations would be \"repugnant\" to the State landlord-tenant law.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-43\">\n   This case presents the hypothetical future lease imagined in the\n   <em>\n    Tipton\n   </em>\n   dicta. We are now called upon to answer those questions.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-44\">\n   <strong>\n    <em>\n     B. Wakefield's Action Against Mr. Smith for Back Rent\n    </em>\n   </strong>\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-45\">\n   <em>\n    The Lease\n   </em>\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-46\">\n   On March 6, 2007, Mr. Smith entered into a lease agreement with Wakefield\n   <footnotemark>\n    3\n   </footnotemark>\n   to rent an apartment in Baltimore City.\n   <footnotemark>\n    4\n   </footnotemark>\n   A one-page cover sheet identified the address of the property and the tenant, specified the term (month-to-month) and the monthly rent, and set forth the basic lease agreement, incorporating an attached preprinted form entitled \"Lease Covenants.\" The cover page included signature lines for the tenant and landlord's agent followed by \"(Seal).\" The attached Lease Covenants form consisted of seven pages of 90 numbered\n   sections of varying lengths that stated various conditions of the lease and obligations of the tenant. Among those provisions was a paragraph, which stated (in a font considerably smaller than what appears below):\n  </p>\n  <blockquote id=\"p-47\">\n   <strong>\n    <em>\n     STATUTE OF LIMITATIONS\n    </em>\n   </strong>\n   : This lease is under seal and is subject to the twelve-year limitation period of Section 5-102 of the Courts and Judicial Proceedings Article of the Annotated Code of Maryland.\n  </blockquote>\n  <p id=\"p-48\">\n   This provision of the lease appeared to echo the dicta in the\n   <em>\n    Tipton\n   </em>\n   decision quoted earlier.\n   <footnotemark>\n    5\n   </footnotemark>\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-49\">\n   <em>\n    Complaint, Motion to Dismiss, and Trial in District Court\n   </em>\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-50\">\n   On September 22, 2015, Wakefield filed a complaint in the District Court sitting in Baltimore City. In an attachment to the complaint, Wakefield alleged that Mr. Smith had failed to pay rent on December 1, 2007, and had been evicted as of the end of January 2008 - more than seven and a half years before the filing of the complaint. Wakefield sought to recover $ 4,035.42 (for unpaid rent and related costs) from Mr. Smith plus interest, attorney's fees, and court costs.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-51\">\n   Nearly two more years passed before Wakefield served Mr. Smith with the complaint on August 14, 2017. Mr. Smith filed a notice of intent to defend (later amended), in which he stated, among other things, that he had given the landlord 90 days advance notice of his intent to vacate the property and that he owed no rent as of that time. In a written submission to the District Court, Mr. Smith also argued that Wakefield had failed to file its action within the three-year period of limitations applicable to an action for back rent. In response, Wakefield asserted that the lease was a contract under seal and that the applicable period of limitations was therefore 12 years pursuant to CJ \u00a7 5-102. At the trial on December 18, 2017, the District Court rejected Mr. Smith's limitations\n   defense\n   and entered judgment for Wakefield in the amount it had requested.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-52\">\n   De Novo\n   <em>\n    Appeal in Circuit Court\n   </em>\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-53\">\n   Mr. Smith pursued a\n   <em>\n    de novo\n   </em>\n   appeal in the Circuit Court for Baltimore City. In that court, he moved to dismiss the complaint on the basis of the statute of limitations. On April 20, 2018, the Circuit Court heard argument on the motion and denied it. After conducting a\n   <em>\n    de novo\n   </em>\n   trial that same day, the Circuit Court entered judgment in favor of Wakefield.\n   <footnotemark>\n    6\n   </footnotemark>\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-54\">\n   Mr. Smith then filed a petition for a writ of\n   <em>\n    certiorari,\n   </em>\n   which we granted on July 12, 2018.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-55\">\n   <strong>\n    II\n   </strong>\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-56\">\n   <strong>\n    Discussion\n   </strong>\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-57\">\n   <strong>\n    <em>\n     A.

The relevant facts are undisputed and the Circuit Court based that ruling on its understanding of the limitations period applicable to an action for back rent under Mr. Smith's lease with Wakefield. Thus, the issue before us is a question of law.

The Revisor's Note explained the simplified format of the new section: \"Rather than listing the various forms of action, it is decided that a blanket three year provision, with exceptions for other limitations, be substituted.\" Chapter 2, First Special Session, Laws of Maryland 1973 at 204.

Two years later, the revised Article 21 was adopted with minor changes (together with a few provisions transferred from other articles) as the new Real Property Article (\"RP\"). Chapter 12, Laws of Maryland 1974. As part of the 1972 revision, the Legislature eliminated the requirement of a seal for conveyances of real property and leases.\n   <em>\n    See\n   </em>\n   Maryland Code, Article 21, \u00a7 4-101 (1972).

Revision of the Landlord-Tenant Law\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-81\">\n   Coincident with the early years of code revision that produced the Courts and Judicial Proceedings Article and the Real Property Article, the General Assembly also revised the landlord-tenant law applicable to residential leases. In particular, it enacted RP \u00a7 8-208, which enumerates certain protections for tenants.\n   <em>\n    See\n   </em>\n   Chapter 375, Laws of Maryland 1974. Among those protections was an anti-waiver provision now codified, with minor amendments, in RP \u00a7 8-208(d)(2) :\n  </p>\n  <blockquote id=\"p-82\">\n   (d) A landlord may not use a lease or form of lease containing any provision that:\n  </blockquote>\n  <blockquote id=\"p-83\">\n   * * *\n  </blockquote>\n  <blockquote id=\"p-84\">\n   (2) Has the tenant agree to waive or to forego any right or remedy provided by applicable law;\n  </blockquote>\n  <p id=\"p-85\">\n   Any provision in a lease prohibited by this section is unenforceable.

Although the purpose of this dicta is not clear, it is evident that the Court could not have been conclusively deciding the question of whether CJ \u00a7 5-102 could apply to an action for back rent arising from a residential\n   lease, as the Court explicitly declined to decide, and left for another day, the question of whether a 12-year period of limitations would be contrary to RP \u00a7 8-208(d)(2).\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-90\">\n   The reasoning that underlies the actual holding in\n   <em>\n    Tipton\n   </em>\n   points to a conclusion contrary to that which Wakefield wishes us to draw - at least in the absence of legislative action. The\n   <em>\n    Tipton\n   </em>\n   Court reviewed the case law and legislative history and determined that CJ \u00a7 5-101, rather than CJ \u00a7 5-102, was applicable in that case. It noted that \"since 1715 ... all claims for rent arrears have been subject to a three-year statute of\n   limitations,\" and concluded the analysis section by highlighting that a \"clear intent of the legislature to substantively modify the law is missing from the legislative history of the relevant statutes at issue in the case\n   <em>\n    sub judice.\n   </em>\n   \" In other words, the law had always applied a three-year statute of limitations to back rent claims, and there is no legislative history suggesting that the Legislature had intended to change that longstanding period of limitations. Contrary to the notion that\n   <em>\n    Tipton\n   </em>\n   created a road map for quadrupling the statute of limitations for residential leases, the analysis in that opinion all but closed the door to the possibility that residential leases could ever become a specialty without further legislative action.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-91\">\n   5. Summary\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-92\">\n   Prior to the early 1970s, residential leases were commonly executed under seal, and an action for back rent owed under such a lease had to be filed within a three-year statute of limitations. The largely non-substantive revision of the statutes governing limitations periods retained that three-year period of limitations for such actions. The concurrent revision of the statutes governing real property eliminated the need for a seal in residential leases. As the Court noted in\n   <em>\n    Tipton\n   </em>\n   , there is no indication in the code revision of the early 1970s that the Legislature intended to provide for an extension of the longstanding three-year period of limitations for back rent actions. Indeed, it would seem odd to conclude that a landlord's decision to add an unnecessary seal to a residential lease form - or an additional sentence that invoked the concept of a \"contract under seal\" - would quadruple that period of limitations when the previous use of the seal in such leases did not signify a longer period of limitations. Moreover, such a conclusion is at odds with legislative enactments contemporaneous with the code revision of the early 1970s that expanded protections for residential tenants and precluded waiver of those protections in a lease. In the absence of legislative action, the reasoning of the Court in\n   <em>\n    Tipton\n   </em>\n   does not counsel\n   otherwise.\n   <footnotemark>\n    15\n   </footnotemark>\n   So the \"road map\" does not get Wakefield to where it wants to go. There may be an alternative route to the result that Wakefield seeks - a more generous period of limitations for a landlord seeking to collect back rent from a residential tenant. Like a contemporary navigational device,\n   <em>\n    Tipton\n   </em>\n   may offer a way to re-route. We consider that alternative path in the next section of this opinion.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-93\">\n   <strong>\n    <em>\n     C. Whether There Was an Enforceable Agreement to Alter the Statute of Limitations\n    </em>\n   </strong>\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-94\">\n   As noted earlier, the Court in\n   <em>\n    Tipton\n   </em>\n   observed, in the first two statements of its holding, that parties to a contract may agree to waive a statute of limitations.\n   <extracted-citation case-ids=\"1279911\" index=\"52\" url=\"https://cite.case.law/md/364/419/\">\n    364 Md. at\n   </extracted-citation>\n   422 n.3, 425 n.9,\n   <extracted-citation case-ids=\"1279911\" index=\"53\" url=\"https://cite.case.law/md/364/419/\">\n    773 A.2d 488\n   </extracted-citation>\n   . Other than stating that \"[g]enerally, affixation of a seal, alone, will not constitute such a waiver,\" the Court did not explicitly discuss the concept of waiver with respect to the facts of the case before it. However, the dicta at the conclusion of the opinion might be understood as the\n   Court's speculation as to how parties might waive the three-year period of limitations in CJ \u00a7 5-101 and extend the period of limitations by doing something other than simply affixing a seal. At the time it decided\n   <em>\n    Tipton\n   </em>\n   , the Court did not have the benefit of our subsequent decision in\n   <em>\n    Ceccone v.

Although the question in that case was whether the relevant period of limitations could be shortened from three years (as provided in statute) to one year (as provided in the contract), the Court discussed the criteria for recognizing any private agreement to alter a statutory period of limitations. Endorsing a formula offered in a prior opinion of the Court of Special Appeals, this Court held that parties may agree to a provision that modifies the period of limitations that would otherwise apply to a cause of action, provided (1) there is no controlling statute to the contrary, (2) the modification is reasonable, and (3) the modification is not subject to other defenses such as fraud, duress, or misrepresentation.\n   <extracted-citation case-ids=\"12315229,12490326\" index=\"56\" url=\"https://cite.case.law/md/454/680/\">\n    454 Md. at 693-94\n   </extracted-citation>\n   ,\n   <extracted-citation case-ids=\"12315229,12490326\" index=\"57\" url=\"https://cite.case.law/md/454/680/\">\n    165 A.3d 475\n   </extracted-citation>\n   .\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-96\">\n   With respect to the first issue - whether there is a controlling statute that precludes waiver of the three-year statute of limitations - Mr. Smith points to RP \u00a7 8-208(d)(2). As noted earlier, that statute provides, in pertinent part, that a lease may not provide that \"the tenant agree to waive or to forego any right or remedy provided by applicable law.\" Whether an extension of the three-year period of limitations for a back rent action is precluded by RP \u00a7 8-208(d) was one of the questions raised, but not answered, in\n   <em>\n    Tipton\n   </em>\n   .\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-97\">\n   The longstanding three-year period of limitations for a back rent action based on a residential lease is clearly \"provided by applicable law\" - CJ \u00a7 5-101 and its predecessors.\n   <footnotemark>\n    16\n   </footnotemark>\n   The\n   question is whether it is a \"right or remedy.\" It does not appear to fit the ordinary definition of \"remedy.\"\n   <footnotemark>\n    17\n   </footnotemark>\n   The\n   statute of limitations may be considered a \"right,\" however, in the sense that it confers on a potential defendant the right to be free of litigation based on the particular cause of action.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-98\">\n   Even if RP \u00a7 8-208(d) did not preclude an agreement to extend the statute of limitations pertinent to such actions, there remains the question of whether such an extension is reasonable in circumstances such as these. In\n   <em>\n    Ceccone\n   </em>\n   , the Court suggested that the following factors bear on that question: the length of the modified period of limitations, its relation to the statutory period, the relative bargaining power of the parties, the subject matter of the contract, and whether the modification is one-sided in effect, among other things.\n   <extracted-citation case-ids=\"12315229,12490326\" index=\"58\" url=\"https://cite.case.law/md/454/680/\">\n    454 Md. at 697-98\n   </extracted-citation>\n   ,\n   <extracted-citation case-ids=\"12315229,12490326\" index=\"59\" url=\"https://cite.case.law/md/454/680/\">\n    165 A.3d 475\n   </extracted-citation>\n   .\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-99\">\n   Here the modification would quadruple the period of time within which an action for back rent could be brought - from three years to 12 years. Notably, in this case, the matter did not come to trial until nearly a decade after the termination of the lease. Many businesses or government agencies would not have retained records relating to a contractual relationship that ended so long ago. It seems even more unlikely that an individual tenant like Mr. Smith would have retained the necessary records to defend against such a claim.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-100\">\n   With respect to the relative bargaining power of the parties, this Court has acknowledged that residential leases are less likely to be the product of arms-length negotiation than commercial leases.\n   <em>\n    See\n   </em>\n   <em>\n    Lockett v. Blue Ocean Bristol, LLC\n   </em>\n   ,\n   <extracted-citation case-ids=\"4165727\" index=\"60\" url=\"https://cite.case.law/md/446/397/#p419\">\n    446 Md. 397\n   </extracted-citation>\n   , 419,\n   <extracted-citation case-ids=\"4165727\" index=\"61\" url=\"https://cite.case.law/md/446/397/#p419\">\n    132 A.3d 257\n   </extracted-citation>\n   (2016). In this case, the lease provision lengthening the period of limitations appears in a preprinted form addendum to the lease. There is no apparent\n   option for the tenant to opt out of it when entering into the lease. While the modification is not one-sided on its face, we have not been pointed to any potential action that a tenant would likely bring under the lease a decade after its termination. In our view, the effect of this provision is to quadruple the period of time for the landlord to pursue a collection action for back rent, without providing any similar benefit to the other party to the contract.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-101\">\n   Finally, the subject matter of the contract - rental of a housing unit - is unlikely to generate causes of action for which an extended period of limitations would be necessary. For example, the basis for an action for back rent - failure to pay rent - will be known immediately to the injured party and is unlikely to require extensive investigation. In our view, a nine-year extension of the period for bringing a back rent action is not a reasonable modification of the applicable period of limitations chosen by the Legislature.\n   <footnotemark>\n    18\n   </footnotemark>\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-102\">\n   In sum, even if the preprinted paragraph of the lease addendum in this case were considered an agreement to modify the period of limitations, it is not enforceable.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-103\">\n   <strong>\n    III\n   </strong>\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-104\">\n   <strong>\n    Conclusion\n   </strong>\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-105\">\n   Sometimes, when a court says more than is necessary to decide a case, what is unnecessary is also unexamined and not always a good predictor of future decisions. Perhaps that is why courts tend to discount dicta and eschew advisory opinions. The Court in\n   <em>\n    Tipton\n   </em>\n   thoroughly analyzed the issue before it and we adhere to its holding in that case; however, we do not\n   adopt its suggestion as to how to decide a future case like this one.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-106\">\n   For the reasons explained above, we hold:\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-107\">\n   (1) The three-year period of limitations set forth in CJ \u00a7 5-101 governs actions for back rent under residential leases, regardless of whether the lease includes provisions that purport to convert it into a contract under seal.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-108\">\n   (2) The three-year period of limitations that applies to a back rent action under a residential lease is not subject to waiver, in light of RP \u00a7 8-208(d)(2).\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-109\">\n   <strong>\n    JUDGMENT OF THE CIRCUIT COURT FOR BALTIMORE CITY REVERSED AND CASE REMANDED TO THAT COURT WITH DIRECTION TO DISMISS THE COMPLAINT.

Moreover, the policy decision to except residential leases from specialty status is properly within the authority of the General Assembly and not this Court. I also find unpersuasive the Majority's conclusion that, although CJ \u00a7 5-101 no longer specifically references residential leases as did its statutory predecessor, residential leases have been subject to a three-year statute of limitations based on this Court's decision in\n   <em>\n    Henry's Drive-In, Inc. v.

In my view, the Majority relies upon dicta from\n   <em>\n    Henry's Drive-In\n   </em>\n   , that is inclusive because it can be interpreted to support both positions, i.e. either treating residential leases as specialties subject to the twelve-year statute of limitations or applying the blanket three-year statute of limitations.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-114\">\n   To explain my dissent, I begin with the precedent on specialty contracts that has been clearly articulated by this Court.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-115\">\n   <strong>\n    <em>\n     A.

Now, in their opinion, the Majority concludes that any reliance upon this language is ultimately unjustified. Majority Op. at 731-32, 202 A.3d at 1250-51. The Majority relies on\n   <em>\n    Tipton\n   </em>\n   for the proposition that the statutory framework surrounding leases and the associated statutes\n   of limitation did not change throughout recodification. Majority Op. at 720 n. 3, 202 A.3d at 1244 n. 3. However, if this was the case, it is inconsistent that the\n   <em>\n    Tipton\n   </em>\n   Court then offered guidance that residential leases may be transformed into specialties and therefore subject to the associated twelve-year statute of limitations.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-127\">\n   In consideration of the common-law definition of a contract under seal, it becomes evident that all the hallmarks of a contract under seal are present within the lease at issue in the instant appeal. First, the lease contained the word \"Seal\" adjacent to the signatures of the parties. Second, the body of the lease indicated that \"[t]his [l]ease is under seal and is subject to the twelve-year limitations period of Section 5-102 of the Courts &amp; Judicial proceedings Article of the Annotated Code of Maryland.\"\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-128\">\n   Therefore, Wakefield in crafting their residential leases abided by the construct established by this Court as set forth in\n   <em>\n    Tipton\n   </em>\n   .

Clearly, excepting residential leases from specialty status is an appropriate task for the General Assembly and not this Court.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-137\">\n   It is true that the General Assembly has wrestled with this very issue. In 2014, it passed legislation to except certain agreements from the twelve-year limitations period of CJ \u00a7 5-102(a). Specifically, the new statute excepted \"[a] deed of trust, mortgage, or promissory note that has been signed under seal and secures or is secured by owner-occupied residential property...\" 2014 Md. Laws ch. 592; CJ \u00a7 5-102(c)(2). Essentially, the General Assembly determined that parties should not be able to transform these three instruments, in situations where they are secured by residences, into contracts under seal. Thus, the twelve-year limitations period of CJ \u00a7 5-102(a) shall not apply to these specific items. Yet, the General Assembly did not include a residential lease exception in the 2014 legislation even though this Court's opinion in\n   <em>\n    Tipton\n   </em>\n   , which indicated that a residential lease properly formulated as a contract under seal would be subject to the twelve-year limitations period of CJ \u00a7 5-101, had been decided thirteen years earlier.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-138\">\n   Essentially, the Majority's opinion engrafts upon CJ \u00a7 5-102(c) a new residential lease exception absent any indication of the General Assembly's intent to enact such an exception. In fact, bills to craft a residential lease carve-out have been introduced during the 2016 and 2017 sessions of the legislature but have failed.\n   <em>\n    See\n   </em>\n   H.B. 971, 2016 Leg., 436th Sess.

Accordingly, the Majority ultimately relies on dicta far more removed from the underlying action than the dicta in\n   <em>\n    Tipton\n   </em>\n   . Overall, the Majority's rejection of the dicta in\n   <em>\n    Tipton\n   </em>\n   , while relying on dicta from\n   <em>\n    Henry's Drive-In\n   </em>\n   ,\n   <em>\n    Inc.\n   </em>\n   for the proposition that undergirds much of their argument is inconsistent.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-146\">\n   Next, I turn to the question of whether statutes of limitations constitute a right or remedy under \u00a7 8-208 of the Real Property Article (\"RP\").\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-147\">\n   <strong>\n    <em>\n     C.

More specifically, the statute provides that landlords may not include provisions in leases that \"ha[ve] the tenant agree to waive or forego any right or remedy provided by applicable law[.]\" RP \u00a7 8-208(d)(2). Thus, the question of whether the statute of limitations for a particular claim constitutes a \"right or remedy\" within the meaning of RP \u00a7 8-208(d)(2) remains.

In sum, statutes of limitations are procedural mechanisms that may limit an individual's rights, but statutes of limitations do not constitute rights in and of themselves as the majority concludes.\n   <em>\n    Id.\n   </em>\n   Furthermore, the case\n   <em>\n    sub judice\n   </em>\n   is distinct in that it involves a clause which attempts to lengthen the statute of limitations.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-150\">\n   It is simply untenable to conclude that the provision extending the statute of limitations to twelve years found within the lease in the present case is tantamount to an impermissible provision that waives a right or remedy pursuant to RP \u00a7 8-208(d)(2). The lease does not indicate that the extended limitations period only applies to Mr. Smith or Wakefield. Therefore, rather than limiting potential rights or remedies, the provision at issue has the potential to expand a tenant's rights or remedies, as a tenant would have twelve years (instead of three years) to bring any claims arising out of the lease against a landlord. Although the Majority indicates that it is unable to ascertain any situations in which a tenant would bring suit against a landlord \"under the lease a decade after\n   its termination[,]\" it does not follow that no such situations exist. Majority Op. at 735, 202 A.3d at 1253. In sum, there is no conflict between the lease provision at issue and RP \u00a7 8-208(d)(2) because statutes of limitations are procedural devices and not rights. Therefore, RP \u00a7 8-208(d)(2) should not limit a landlord's ability to insert a provision within a lease that lengthens the statute of limitations for claims arising out of that lease.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-151\">\n   In conclusion, the Majority's decision represents a departure from the precedent established by this Court in interpreting the statutes governing specialty contracts. The residential lease in this case fell squarely within the requirements of the statute as interpreted by this Court in\n   <em>\n    Tipton\n   </em>\n   . Any exception for the specialty of a residential lease under seal and with language within the body that evinces an intent to create a contract under seal from the twelve-year statute of limitations is a policy decision within the authority of the General Assembly and not this Court. For these reasons, I respectfully dissent from the Majority's decision.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-152\">\n   Judge Adkins has authorized me to state that she joins in this opinion.\n  </p>\n  <footnote label=\"1\">\n   <p id=\"p-155\">\n    Other \"specialties\" listed in the statute include such things as a promissory note or other instrument under seal, a bond, and a judgment. Certain promissory notes and instruments under seal were excluded from that statute in 2014.

In the hard copy of volume 364 of the Maryland Reports, footnote 9 of the\n    <em>\n     Tipton\n    </em>\n    opinion cross-references\n    <em>\n     footnote 3\n    </em>\n    , which concerns waiver.

Footnote 2 of the\n    <em>\n     Tipton\n    </em>\n    opinion simply states that references to \"section 5-101\" are to CJ \u00a7 5-101 - which would be an unnecessary and perhaps even puzzling cross-reference in this context.

It points to recent proposed legislation that, in several different ways, would have made clear that the 12-year period of limitations for specialties in CJ \u00a7 5-102 does not apply to a residential lease or, in some bills, to anything defined as a \"consumer contract.\"\n    <em>\n     See\n    </em>\n    Senate Bill 837 (2018), House Bill 635 (2018); Senate Bill 1077 (2017), House Bill 994 (2017); House Bill 971 (2016). None of those bills passed the General Assembly and Wakefield infers that the General Assembly therefore intended to allow an extension of the longstanding period of limitations governing actions for back rent from three years to 12 years.\n   </p>\n   <p id=\"p-170\">\n    However, the General Assembly's recent decision not to pass a particular bill does not alter the intent of past sessions of the Legislature when it initially adopted the three-year period of limitations for rent arrearage actions in 1715, and repeatedly retained that period of limitations in subsequent recodifications. Nor does it alter the understanding of the Legislature that retained that period of limitations in the recodification in the 1970s. No action by the General Assembly since that recodification has evidenced any intent to enlarge the period of limitations for actions for back rent. In that context, reliance on the General Assembly's inaction on bills that, in many respects, confirm existing law seems a \"weak reed\" on which to rely.\n    <em>\n     E.g.,\n    </em>\n    <em>\n     Automobile Trade Ass'n of Maryland, Inc. v.
