CONCLUSION...324\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-33\">\n   On December 14, 2012, twenty year old Adam Lanza forced his way into Sandy Hook Elementary School in Newtown and, during the course of 264 seconds, fatally shot twenty first grade children and six staff members, and wounded two other staff members.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-34\">\n   Lanza carried out this massacre using a Bushmaster XM15-E2S semiautomatic rifle that was allegedly manufactured, distributed, and ultimately sold to Lanza's mother by the various defendants' in this case. There is no doubt that Lanza was directly and primarily responsible for this appalling series of crimes. In this action, however, the plaintiffs-administrators of the estates of nine of the decedents-contend that the defendants' also bear some of the blame. The plaintiffs assert a number of different legal theories as to why the defendants' should be held partly responsible for the tragedy. The defendants' counter that all of the plaintiffs' legal theories are not only barred under Connecticut law, but also precluded by a federal statute, the Protection of Lawful Commerce in Arms Act (PLCAA), Pub. L. No. 109-92,\n   <extracted-citation index=\"0\" url=\"https://cite.case.law/citations/?q=119%20Stat.%202095\">\n    119 Stat. 2095\n   </extracted-citation>\n   (2005), codified at\n   <extracted-citation index=\"1\" url=\"https://cite.case.law/citations/?q=15%20U.S.C.%20%C2%A7%C2%A7%207901\">\n    15 U.S.C. \u00a7\u00a7 7901\n   </extracted-citation>\n   through 7903 (2012), which, with limited exceptions, immunizes firearms manufacturers, distributors, and dealers from civil liability for crimes committed by third parties using their weapons. See\n   <extracted-citation index=\"2\" url=\"https://cite.case.law/citations/?q=15%20U.S.C.%20%C2%A7%C2%A7%207902\">\n    15 U.S.C. \u00a7\u00a7 7902\n   </extracted-citation>\n   (a) and 7903 (5) (2012).\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-35\">\n   For the reasons set forth in this opinion, we agree with the defendants' that most of the plaintiffs' claims and legal theories are precluded by established Connecticut law and/or PLCAA. For example, we expressly reject the plaintiffs' theory that, merely by selling semiautomatic rifles-which were legal at the time\n   <footnotemark>\n    1\n   </footnotemark>\n   -to the civilian population, the defendants' became responsible for any crimes committed with those weapons.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-36\">\n   The plaintiffs have offered one narrow legal theory, however, that is recognized under established Connecticut law. Specifically, they allege that the defendants' knowingly marketed, advertised, and promoted the XM15-E2S for civilians to use to carry out offensive,\n   military style combat missions against their perceived enemies. Such use of the XM15-E2S, or any weapon for that matter, would be illegal, and Connecticut law does not permit advertisements that promote or encourage violent, criminal behavior. Following a scrupulous review of the text and legislative history of PLCAA, we also conclude that Congress has not clearly manifested an intent to extinguish the traditional authority of our legislature and our courts to protect the people of Connecticut from the pernicious practices alleged in the present case. The\n   regulation of advertising that threatens the public's health, safety, and morals has long been considered a core exercise of the states' police powers. Accordingly, on the basis of that limited theory, we conclude that the plaintiffs have pleaded allegations sufficient to survive a motion to strike and are entitled to have the opportunity to prove their wrongful marketing allegations. We affirm the trial court's judgment insofar as that court struck the plaintiffs' claims predicated on all other legal theories.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-37\">\n   I\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-38\">\n   PROCEDURAL HISTORY\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-39\">\n   The plaintiffs brought the present action in 2014, seeking damages and unspecified injunctive relief.\n   <footnotemark>\n    2\n   </footnotemark>\n   The\n   defendants' include the Bushmaster defendants' (Remington),\n   <footnotemark>\n    3\n   </footnotemark>\n   one or more of which is alleged to have manufactured the Bushmaster XM15-E2S semiautomatic rifle that was used in the crimes; the Camfour defendants',\n   <footnotemark>\n    4\n   </footnotemark>\n   distributors that allegedly purchased the rifle from Remington and resold it to the Riverview defendants'; and the Riverview defendants',\n   <footnotemark>\n    5\n   </footnotemark>\n   retailers that allegedly sold the rifle to Adam Lanza's mother, Nancy Lanza, in March, 2010.\n   <footnotemark>\n    6\n   </footnotemark>\n   The gravamen of the plaintiffs' claims, which are brought pursuant to this state's wrongful death statute, General Statutes \u00a7 52-555,\n   <footnotemark>\n    7\n   </footnotemark>\n   is that the defendants' (1) negligently entrusted to civilian consumers an AR-15 style assault rifle\n   <footnotemark>\n    8\n   </footnotemark>\n   that is suitable\n   for use only by military and law enforcement personnel, and (2) violated the Connecticut Unfair Trade Practices Act (CUTPA), General Statutes \u00a7 42-110a et seq.,\n   <footnotemark>\n    9\n   </footnotemark>\n   through the sale or wrongful marketing of the rifle.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-40\">\n   The defendants' moved to strike the plaintiffs' complaint, contending that all of the plaintiffs' claims are\n   barred by PLCAA. The defendants' also argued that, to the extent that the plaintiffs' claims sound in negligent entrustment, the plaintiffs failed to state a legally valid negligent entrustment claim under Connecticut common law, and, to the extent that their claims are predicated on alleged CUTPA violations, they are legally insufficient because, among other things, (1) the plaintiffs lack standing to bring a CUTPA action, (2) the plaintiffs' claims are time barred by CUTPA's three year statute of limitations; see General Statutes \u00a7 42-110g (f) ; (3) personal injuries and death are not cognizable CUTPA damages, and (4) the plaintiffs' CUTPA claims are simply veiled product liability claims and, therefore, are barred by General Statutes \u00a7 52-572n (a), the exclusivity provision of the Connecticut Product Liability Act (Product Liability Act).\n   <footnotemark>\n    10\n   </footnotemark>\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-41\">\n   In response, the plaintiffs argued that PLCAA does not confer immunity on the defendants' for purposes of this case because two statutory exceptions to PLCAA immunity-for claims alleging negligent entrustment (negligent entrustment exception)\n   <footnotemark>\n    11\n   </footnotemark>\n   and for claims alleging a violation of a statute applicable to the sale or marketing of firearms (predicate exception)\n   <footnotemark>\n    12\n   </footnotemark>\n   -apply to their claims. The plaintiffs further argued that, for various reasons, the defendants' state law negligent entrustment and CUTPA arguments were ill founded.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-42\">\n   Although the trial court rejected most of the defendants' arguments, the court concluded that (1) the plaintiffs' allegations do not fit within the common-law tort of negligent entrustment, (2) PLCAA bars the plaintiffs' claims insofar as those claims sound in negligent\n   entrustment, and (3) the plaintiffs lack standing to bring wrongful death claims predicated on CUTPA violations because they never entered into a business relationship with the defendants'. Accordingly, the court granted in their entirety the defendants' motions to strike the plaintiffs' amended complaint.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-43\">\n   On appeal, the plaintiffs challenge each of those conclusions.\n   <footnotemark>\n    13\n   </footnotemark>\n   For their part, the\n   defendants' contend, as alternative grounds for affirmance, that the trial court improperly rejected their other CUTPA arguments. We conclude that the majority of the plaintiffs' claims were properly struck insofar as those claims are predicated on the theory that the sale of the XM15-E2S rifle to Lanza's mother or to the civilian market generally constituted either negligent entrustment; see part III of this opinion; or an unfair trade practice. See part IV B of this opinion. We also conclude, however, that the plaintiffs have standing to prosecute their CUTPA claims under\n   Connecticut law. See part IV A of this opinion. We further conclude that PLCAA does not bar the plaintiffs from proceeding on the single, limited theory that the defendants' violated CUTPA by marketing the XM15-E2S to civilians for criminal purposes, and that those wrongful marketing tactics caused or contributed to the Sandy Hook massacre.\n   <footnotemark>\n    14\n   </footnotemark>\n   See part V of this opinion. Accordingly, we affirm in part and reverse in part the judgment of the trial court and remand the case for further proceedings.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-44\">\n   II\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-45\">\n   ALLEGED FACTS\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-46\">\n   Because we are reviewing the judgment of the trial court rendered on a motion to strike, we must assume the truth of the following facts, as alleged by the plaintiffs.\n   <footnotemark>\n    15\n   </footnotemark>\n   Lanza carried out the Sandy Hook massacre using a Bushmaster XM15-E2S rifle. That rifle is Remington's version of the AR-15 assault rifle, which is substantially similar to the standard issue M16 military service rifle used by the United States Army and other nations' armed forces, but fires only in semiautomatic mode.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-47\">\n   The AR-15 and M16 are highly lethal weapons that are engineered to deliver maximum carnage with extreme efficiency. Several features make these rifles especially well suited for combat and enable a shooter to inflict unparalleled carnage. Rapid semiautomatic fire \"unleashes a torrent of bullets in a matter of seconds.\" The ability to accommodate large capacity magazines allows for prolonged assaults. Exceptional muzzle velocity makes each hit catastrophic. Indeed, the plaintiffs contend, bullets fired from these rifles travel at such a high velocity that they cause a shockwave to pass through the body upon impact, resulting in catastrophic injuries even in areas remote to the direct wound. Finally, the fact that the AR-15 and M16 are lightweight, air-cooled, gas-operated, and magazine fed, enabling rapid fire with limited recoil, means that their lethality is not dependent on good aim or ideal combat conditions.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-48\">\n   These features endow the AR-15 with a lethality that surpasses even that of other semiautomatic weapons. \"The net effect is more wounds, of greater severity, in more victims, in less time.\" That lethality, combined with the ease with which criminals and mentally unstable individuals can acquire an AR-15, has made the rifle the weapon of choice for mass shootings, including school shootings.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-49\">\n   The particular weapon at issue in this case was manufactured and sold by the Bushmaster defendants'. Sometime prior to March, 2010, the Bushmaster defendants' sold the rifle to the Camfour defendants'. The Camfour defendants' subsequently sold the rifle to the Riverview defendants', who operate a retail gun store located in the town of East Windsor.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-50\">\n   In March, 2010, Lanza's mother purchased the rifle from the Riverview defendants'. Lanza, who was seventeen years old at the time, had expressed a desire to join the elite United States Army Rangers unit. His mother\n   bought the rifle to give to or share with him in order to connect with him. However, when Lanza turned eighteen on April 22, 2010, he did not enlist in the military. Still, he gained unfettered access to a military style assault rifle.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-51\">\n   Eight months later, on the morning of December 14, 2012, Lanza retrieved the rifle and ten 30 round magazines. Using a technique taught in the first person shooter video games that he played, he taped several of those magazines together to allow for faster reloading. He then drove to Sandy Hook Elementary School.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-52\">\n   Just before 9:30 a.m., Lanza shot his way into the locked school using the XM15-E2S. He immediately shot and killed Mary Joy Sherlach as well as the school's principal. He subsequently shot and wounded two staff members.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-53\">\n   Lanza next entered Classroom 8, where he used the rifle to kill two adults and fifteen first grade children, including five of the plaintiffs. Finally, he entered Classroom 10, where he used the rifle to kill two adults and five first grade children, including three of the plaintiffs. Nine children from Classroom 10 were able to escape when Lanza paused to reload with another magazine.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-54\">\n   In total, the attack lasted less than four and one-half minutes, during which Lanza fired at least 154 rounds from the XM15-E2S, killing twenty-six and wounding two others.\n   <footnotemark>\n    16\n   </footnotemark>\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-55\">\n   The plaintiffs filed the present action in 2014 seeking damages and injunctive relief. Each of the counts in\n   the operative first amended complaint is predicated on two distinct theories of liability. First, the plaintiffs contend that the AR-15 is a military grade weapon that is \"grossly ill-suited\" for legitimate civilian purposes such as self-defense and recreation. They also allege that the AR-15 has become the weapon of choice for mass shootings and, therefore, that the risks associated with selling the weapon to the civilian market far outweigh any potential benefits. The defendants' continued to sell the XM15-E2S despite their knowledge of these facts. Therefore, the plaintiffs contend, it was both negligent and an unfair trade practice for each of the defendants' to sell the weapon, knowing that it eventually would be purchased by a civilian customer who might share it with other civilian users.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-56\">\n   The plaintiffs' second theory of liability is that the defendants' advertised and marketed the XM15-E2S in an unethical, oppressive, immoral and unscrupulous manner. They contend that the defendants' have sought to grow the AR-15 market by extolling the militaristic and assaultive qualities of their AR-15 rifles and, specifically, the weapon's suitability for offensive combat missions. The plaintiffs argue that the defendants' militaristic marketing reinforces the image of the AR-15 as a combat weapon that is intended to be used for the purposes of waging war and killing human beings. Consistent with that image, the defendants' further promoted the XM15-E2S as a combat weapon system by designating in their product catalogues that the rifle comes \"standard\" with a 30 round magazine which, the plaintiffs allege, differs from how the defendants' promote and sell rifles for legal civilian purposes such as hunting and sport shooting.\n   <footnotemark>\n    17\n   </footnotemark>\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-57\">\n   The plaintiffs further contend that the defendants' unethically promoted their assault weapons for offensive, military style missions by publishing advertisements and distributing product catalogs that (1) promote the AR-15 as \"the uncompromising choice when you demand a rifle as mission adaptable as you are,\" (2) depict soldiers moving on patrol through jungles, armed with Bushmaster rifles, (3) feature the slogan \"[w]hen you need to perform under pressure, Bushmaster delivers,\" superimposed over the silhouette of a soldier holding his helmet against the backdrop of an American flag, (4) tout the \"military proven performance\" of firearms like the XM15-E2S, (5) promote civilian rifles as \"the ultimate combat weapons system,\" (6) invoke the unparalleled destructive power of their AR-15 rifles, (7) claim that the most elite branches of the United States military, including the United States Navy\n   SEALs, the United States Army Green Berets and Army Rangers, and other special forces, have used the AR-15, and (8) depict a close-up of an AR-15 with the following slogan: \"Forces of opposition, bow down. You are single-handedly outnumbered.\"\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-58\">\n   Finally, with respect to this second, wrongful marketing theory of liability, the plaintiffs contend that the defendants' marketing of the XM15-E2S to civilians for offensive assault missions was a substantial factor in causing the plaintiffs' injuries. Specifically, they contend that Lanza had dreamed as a child of joining the elite Army Rangers unit of the United States Army and was, therefore, especially susceptible to militaristic marketing. They further contend that he selected the\n   XM15-E2S for his assault from among an arsenal that included various less lethal arms-at least three handguns, one shotgun, two bolt action rifles, and three samurai swords-and that he specifically chose the XM15-E2S not only for its functional capabilities, including its assaultive qualities and efficiency in inflicting mass casualties, but also because of its marketed association with the military.\n   <footnotemark>\n    18\n   </footnotemark>\n   Finally, they contend that Lanza was a devoted player of first person shooter games featuring variants of the XM15-E2S and that he employed techniques taught in those games to enhance the lethality of his assault on the school. In other words, the plaintiffs allege that the attack, had it occurred at all, would have been less lethal and the carnage less grievous if Lanza had not been encouraged by the defendants' marketing campaign to select the XM15-E2S as his weapon of choice and taught by violent video games how to kill with it most efficiently. Additional facts and procedural history will be set forth as necessary.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-59\">\n   III\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-60\">\n   NEGLIGENT ENTRUSTMENT\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-61\">\n   In opposition to the defendants' motions to strike, the plaintiffs argued that their claims were not barred by PLCAA because the claims are predicated on allegations of negligent entrustment and CUTPA violations, both of which satisfy statutory exceptions to PLCAA immunity. In this part of the opinion, we consider whether the trial court correctly concluded that the plaintiffs' claims were legally insufficient to the extent that those claims are predicated on a theory of negligent entrustment. The trial court concluded both that the\n   plaintiffs had not sufficiently pleaded a cause of action in negligent entrustment under Connecticut common law and, in the alternative, that the plaintiffs' allegations did not satisfy PLCAA's statutory definition of negligent entrustment. See\n   <extracted-citation index=\"3\" url=\"https://cite.case.law/citations/?q=15%20U.S.C.%20%C2%A7%207903\">\n    15 U.S.C. \u00a7 7903\n   </extracted-citation>\n   (5) (B) (2012).\n   <footnotemark>\n    19\n   </footnotemark>\n   The plaintiffs challenge both conclusions on appeal. Because we agree with the trial court that the plaintiffs have not pleaded a legally sufficient cause of action in negligent entrustment under our state's common law, we need not consider whether negligent entrustment claims must meet stricter requirements in\n   order to satisfy the federal statutory exception.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-62\">\n   The following additional procedural history is relevant to this issue. In response to the defendants' motions to strike, the plaintiffs argued that their claims are not precluded by PLCAA because each of their claims is predicated in part on a theory of negligent entrustment and PLCAA does not confer immunity on sellers of firearms in actions for negligent entrustment. See\n   <extracted-citation index=\"4\" url=\"https://cite.case.law/citations/?q=15%20U.S.C.%20%C2%A7%207903\">\n    15 U.S.C. \u00a7 7903\n   </extracted-citation>\n   (5) (A) (ii) (2012).\n   <footnotemark>\n    20\n   </footnotemark>\n   In its decision granting the defendants' motions to strike, the trial court concluded that an action for negligent entrustment will lie only when the supplier of a dangerous instrumentality such as a firearm knows or has reason to know that the\n   <em>\n    direct entrustee\n   </em>\n   is likely to use the item unsafely. Because the plaintiffs did not allege that there was any specific reason to believe that the Camfour\n   defendants' (as direct entrustees of the Remington defendants'), the Riverview defendants' (as direct entrustees of the Camfour defendants'), or Lanza's mother (as a direct entrustee of the Riverview defendants') was incompetent to operate the XM15-E2S or had a propensity to use the weapon in an unsafe manner, the court granted all of the defendants' motions to strike with respect to the plaintiffs' negligent entrustment theories of liability.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-63\">\n   We commence our review of this issue with a brief discussion of the history of and principles that animate the tort of negligent entrustment. The cause of action for negligent entrustment represents a departure from the general rule that an individual cannot be held liable for the conduct of others. It reflects a legitimate societal concern that a person in possession of a dangerous instrument should bear the responsibility of exercising care when entrusting that instrument to another, given the serious risk to society if items like firearms or automobiles should fall into unfit hands. See J. Fisher, Comment, \" So How Do You Hold This Thing Again?: Why the Texas Supreme Court Should Turn the Safety off the Negligent Entrustment of a Firearm Cause of Action,\"\n   <extracted-citation index=\"5\" url=\"https://cite.case.law/citations/?q=46%20Tex.%20Tech%20L.%20Rev.%20489\">\n    46 Tex. Tech. L. Rev. 489\n   </extracted-citation>\n   , 495, 501 (2014). The primary question that we must resolve is whether these principles apply only when the entrustor believes or has specific reason to believe that the\n   <em>\n    direct entrustee\n   </em>\n   is likely to use the item unsafely or, rather, whether they also apply when it is reasonably foreseeable that the entrustment ultimately will lead to injurious use, whether by the direct entrustee or by some unknown third party.\n   <footnotemark>\n    21\n   </footnotemark>\n   If the former, then the trial court properly\n   found for the defendants' on this issue as a matter of law; if the latter, then the plaintiffs are correct that the plaintiffs' claim presents an issue of fact to be decided by a jury.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-64\">\n   Although the idea that it may be wrong to entrust a weapon or other dangerous item to one likely to misuse it is as old as civilization,\n   <footnotemark>\n    22\n   </footnotemark>\n   the common-law tort of negligent\n   entrustment traces its origins to\n   <em>\n    Dixon\n   </em>\n   v.\n   <em>\n    Bell\n   </em>\n   , 105 Eng. Rep. 1023 (K.B. 1816). See B.

Rev. 467\n   </extracted-citation>\n   , 467 and n.1 (1983). In\n   <em>\n    Dixon\n   </em>\n   , the defendant sent a preadolescent girl to retrieve a loaded gun, resulting in the accidental shooting of the plaintiff's son. See\n   <em>\n    Dixon\n   </em>\n   v.\n   <em>\n    Bell\n   </em>\n   , supra, 1023.

Most jurisdictions that have recognized a cause of action in negligent entrustment likewise require that the actor have actual or constructive knowledge that the specific person to whom a dangerous instrumentality is directly entrusted is unfit to use it properly.

Section 390, which further defines the tort of negligent entrustment, provides that \"[o]ne who supplies ... a chattel for the use of another whom the supplier knows or has reason to know to be likely because of his youth, inexperience, or otherwise, to use it in a manner involving unreasonable risk of physical harm to himself and others ... is subject to liability for physical harm resulting to them.\" 2\n   <extracted-citation index=\"24\" url=\"https://cite.case.law/citations/?q=6%20Hamline%20L.%20Rev.%20467\">\n    id.,\n   </extracted-citation>\n   \u00a7 390, p. 314; see also B.

We take it as well established, then, that, in order to prove negligent entrustment, a plaintiff must demonstrate that (1) the defendant has entrusted a potentially dangerous instrumentality to a third person (2) whom the entrustor knows or should know intends or is likely to use the instrumentality in a manner that involves unreasonable risk of physical harm, and (3) such use does in fact cause harm to the entrustee or others.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-70\">\n   The rule that a cause of action for negligent entrustment will lie only when the entrustor knows or has reason to know that the direct entrustee is likely to use a dangerous instrumentality in an unsafe manner would bar the plaintiffs' negligent entrustment claims. Specifically, there is no allegation in this case that there was any reason to expect that Lanza's mother was likely to use the rifle in an unsafe manner.\n   <footnotemark>\n    23\n   </footnotemark>\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-71\">\n   The plaintiffs, recognizing that they cannot prevail under this rule, invite us to adopt a different framework, one \"that focuses on the existence of a nexus between the defendant and the dangerous\n   user-rather than the number of steps between them ....\" In other words, their proposal is that a party alleging negligent entrustment need prove only that it was reasonably foreseeable that, following the initial entrustment of a\n   dangerous instrumentality, that instrumentality ultimately would come into the possession of someone who would use it in an unsafe manner. A jury could find that standard satisfied in this case, they contend, because (1) Remington allegedly marketed its assault rifles to young men who play violent, first person shooter video games and who, as a class, have a history of using such rifles in real mass shootings, and (2) there is evidence that individuals who legally purchase weapons such as the AR-15 often share the weapons with family members, including young men.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-72\">\n   We decline the plaintiffs' invitation to stretch the doctrine of negligent entrustment so far beyond its historical moorings. We recognize that some of our sister state courts have permitted negligent entrustment actions to proceed when, although there was no indication that the direct entrustee was incompetent to use a dangerous item, there was reason to believe that the entrustee would in turn share the item with a\n   <em>\n    specific\n   </em>\n   third party who would misuse it. This has been the case, for example, when a parent or other agent purchased a weapon or vehicle for a child who was present at the place and time of sale.\n   <footnotemark>\n    24\n   </footnotemark>\n   We need not decide whether and to what extent Connecticut would recognize a cause of action for negligent entrustment under such circumstances, however, because, in the present case, the plaintiffs do not allege that any of the defendants' possessed any knowledge or had any specific reason to believe either that Lanza's mother would share the XM15-E2S with her son or that he was especially likely to operate it unsafely or illegally. In any event, the plaintiffs have failed to cite to a single case, from any\n   jurisdiction, that allowed an action for negligent entrustment to proceed when the nexus between a manufacturer of a product and the person who ultimately used that product in an unsafe manner was as attenuated as it is in the present case.\n   <footnotemark>\n    25\n   </footnotemark>\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-73\">\n   We also recognize that there is authority for the proposition that entrustment may be deemed negligent when the entrustor has no specific knowledge regarding the entrustee's personal competence or character but knows that the entrustee is a member of a class that is notoriously unfit to safely utilize the entrusted item. See 2 Restatement (Second), supra, \u00a7 308, comment\n   (b), p. 100. The plaintiffs argue that we should apply that principle in this case because (1) gun buyers as a class are known to sometimes share their weapons with family members, including young males, and (2) young males, in turn, are known to sometimes use assault weapons to commit mass shootings. Once again, we decline the invitation to so dramatically expand the scope of negligent entrustment liability.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-74\">\n   As we noted, the tort of negligent entrustment saw its florescence, if not its modern genesis, in the advent of the mass produced automobile. See B. Todd, supra,\n   <extracted-citation index=\"26\" url=\"https://cite.case.law/citations/?q=6%20Hamline%20L.%20Rev.%20467\">\n    6 Hamline L. Rev. 467\n   </extracted-citation>\n   ; A. Cholodofsky, Note, \"\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-75\">\n   Torts: Does the Negligent Entrustment Doctrine Apply to Sellers?\"\n   <extracted-citation index=\"27\" url=\"https://cite.case.law/citations/?q=39%20U.%20Fla.%20L.%20Rev.%20925\">\n    39 U. Fla. L. Rev. 925\n   </extracted-citation>\n   , 928 (1987). In some instances, a person may be unsuited to drive an automobile because he is reckless, or inebriated, or otherwise distinctly unfit to drive safely on the public roads. See A. Cholodofsky, supra, 926 and nn. 5-6. It also is a matter of common sense and common knowledge, however, that certain classes of people-e.g., young children and blind persons-are inherently unfit to drive. Our laws recognize as much. See General Statutes \u00a7 14-36 (c) and (e) (establishing, among other things, age and vision screening requirements for motor vehicle operator's permit or license). Accordingly, one may be negligent for entrusting an automobile to such users even in the absence of any particular knowledge about their individual driving skills, experience, or temperament. A jury reasonably might conclude that the same is true with respect to firearms and other weapons and dangerous equipment. See B. Todd, supra, 468-69.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-76\">\n   The plaintiffs' theory, however, is fundamentally different. They do not contend that all gun buyers such as Lanza's mother, or young men such as Lanza, are incapable of safely operating an AR-15. The plaintiffs do not even contend that such users usually or even frequently operate such weapons unsafely or unlawfully. Rather, the plaintiffs contend that it is objectively unreasonable to legally sell an assault weapon to an adult buyer, for no other reason than that some small subset of buyers will share weapons with their young adult sons and some much smaller subset of young adult males will use those weapons to commit terrible, random crimes. The only plausible way to construe that claim-and we do not understand the plaintiffs to deny this-is that any commercial sale of assault weapons to civilian users constitutes negligent entrustment because the social costs of such sales outweigh the perceived benefits. Other courts have rejected such a\n   theory, as do we.

Because we have concluded that\n   the plaintiffs have not pleaded a legally sufficient negligent entrustment claim under Connecticut common law, PLCAA will bar the present action unless (1) the plaintiffs have pleaded a cognizable CUTPA violation, and (2) CUTPA constitutes a predicate statute for purposes of\n   <extracted-citation index=\"34\" url=\"https://cite.case.law/citations/?q=15%20U.S.C.%20%C2%A7%207903\">\n    15 U.S.C. \u00a7 7903\n   </extracted-citation>\n   (5) (A) (iii).\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-80\">\n   In their motions to strike, the defendants' argued, among other things, that (1) the plaintiffs' claims were barred by CUTPA's three year statute of limitations, (2) damages for personal injuries and death resulting therefrom are not cognizable under CUTPA, (3) the plaintiffs' CUTPA claims are precluded by the Product Liability Act; see General Statutes \u00a7 52-572n (a) ; and (4) CUTPA is not a valid predicate statute for purposes of PLCAA. The trial court rejected each of these arguments. The court agreed with the defendants', however,\n   that CUTPA does not afford protection to persons who do not have a consumer or other commercial relationship with the alleged wrongdoer. Accordingly, the court concluded that the plaintiffs lacked standing to pursue wrongful death claims predicated on CUTPA violations.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-81\">\n   On appeal, the plaintiffs contend that the trial court improperly struck their claims for lack of standing to pursue them under CUTPA. For their part, the defendants' claim that the trial court's judgment can be affirmed on the alternative ground that the court's other determinations were improper.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-82\">\n   As an initial matter, we reiterate that the plaintiffs' CUTPA based wrongful death claims are predicated on at least two fundamentally distinct theories of liability. First, the plaintiffs contend that the defendants' violated CUTPA by selling the XM15-E2S to the civilian market despite their knowledge that there is no legitimate civilian use for such a weapon, that assault weapons such as the AR-15 pose unreasonable risks when used by civilians, and that individuals unfit to operate such weapons likely would gain access to them. In other words, the plaintiffs allege, in essence, that any sale of any assault weapon to any civilian purchaser in Connecticut is, ipso facto, an unfair trade practice under CUTPA.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-83\">\n   Second, the plaintiffs contend that the defendants' violated CUTPA by advertising and marketing the XM15-E2S in an unethical, oppressive, immoral, and unscrupulous manner that promoted illegal offensive use of the rifle. Specifically, they allege that the defendants':\n  </p>\n  <blockquote id=\"p-84\">\n   \u2022 promoted use of the XM15-E2S for offensive, assaultive purposes-specifically, for \"waging war and killing human beings\"-and not solely for self-defense, hunting, target practice, collection, or other legitimate civilian firearm uses\n   \u2022 extolled the militaristic qualities of the XM15-E2S\n  </blockquote>\n  <blockquote id=\"p-85\">\n   \u2022 advertised the XM15-E2S as a weapon that allows a single individual to force his multiple opponents to \"bow down\"\n  </blockquote>\n  <blockquote id=\"p-86\">\n   \u2022 marketed and promoted the sale of the XM15-E2S with the expectation and intent that it would be transferred to family members and other unscreened, unsafe users after its purchase.\n  </blockquote>\n  <p id=\"p-87\">\n   The plaintiffs further allege in this regard that such promotional tactics were causally related to some or all of the injuries that were inflicted during the Sandy Hook massacre.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-88\">\n   For the reasons that follow, we conclude that the trial court improperly granted the defendants' motion to strike these allegations in their entirety. We agree with the plaintiffs that the trial court improperly concluded that they lack standing to pursue\n   any of their CUTPA claims against the defendants'. With respect to the plaintiffs' first theory of CUTPA liability-that the sale of AR-15s to the civilian population is ipso facto unfair-we agree with the defendants' that the trial court's judgment can be affirmed on the alternative ground that the plaintiffs' claim is time barred under the CUTPA statute of limitations. Cf. footnote 14 of this opinion. However, with respect to the plaintiffs' second theory of liability-that the defendants' wrongful marketing of the XM15-E2S for illegal, offensive purposes was a causal factor in increasing the casualties of the Sandy Hook massacre-we find the defendants' various alternative bases for affirmance unpersuasive.\n   A\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-89\">\n   CUTPA Standing\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-90\">\n   Although the plaintiffs brought their claims pursuant to the wrongful death statute; General Statutes \u00a7 52-555 ; a wrongful death action will lie only when the deceased person could have brought a valid claim for the injuries that resulted in death if he or she had survived. See part IV B of this opinion. Accordingly, to survive a motion to strike, the plaintiffs must be able to establish that they have standing to pursue a CUTPA claim for their injuries. We first consider whether the trial court properly concluded that the plaintiffs lacked standing to bring the present action under CUTPA because they were third-party victims who did not have a direct consumer, commercial, or competitor relationship (business relationship or privity requirement) with the defendants'. Because the principal evils associated with unscrupulous and illegal advertising are not ones that necessarily arise from or infect the relationship between an advertiser and its customers, competitors, or business associates, we hold that a party directly injured by conduct resulting from such advertising can bring an action pursuant to CUTPA even in the absence of a business relationship with the defendant. Accordingly, we agree with the plaintiffs that the trial court improperly struck their CUTPA based wrongful death claims.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-91\">\n   Whether one must have entered into a consumer or commercial relationship with an alleged wrongdoer in order to have standing to bring a CUTPA action presents a question of statutory interpretation. The plain meaning of the statutory text must be our lodestar. See General Statutes \u00a7 1-2z.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-92\">\n   General Statutes \u00a7 42-110g (a) creates a private right of action for persons injured by unfair trade practices and provides in relevant part: \"\n   <em>\n    Any person\n   </em>\n   who suffers\n   any ascertainable loss of money or property, real or personal, as a result of the use or employment of a method, act or practice prohibited by section 42-110b, may bring an action ... to recover actual damages....\" (Emphasis added.) On its face, the statute plainly and unambiguously authorizes\n   <em>\n    anyone\n   </em>\n   who has suffered an ascertainable financial loss as a result of an unfair trade practice to bring a CUTPA action. Nothing in the text of the statute indicates that the right afforded by \u00a7 42-110g (a) is enjoyed only by persons who have done business of some sort with a defendant.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-93\">\n   Even if we were to conclude that the statute is ambiguous in this regard, we perceive nothing in the legislative history or purpose of the statute that would support the defendants' theory that something more than an ascertainable financial loss caused by a prohibited act is necessary to confer standing under CUTPA. When CUTPA originally was enacted in 1973, the statute authorized private actions for \"[a]ny person who\n   <em>\n    purchases or leases\n   </em>\n   <em>\n    goods or services from a seller or lessor primarily for personal, family or household purposes and thereby\n   </em>\n   suffers any ascertainable loss of money or property, real or personal, as a result ....\" (Emphasis added.) Public Acts 1973, No. 73-615, \u00a7 7 (P.A. 73-615), codified as amended at General Statutes (Rev. to 1975) \u00a7 42-110g (a). It is clear, then, that a direct consumer relationship initially was required in order to bring a CUTPA action.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-94\">\n   Over the following decade, however, a series of amendments eliminated that privity requirement. Of particular note are the 1975 and 1979 amendments. In 1975, the legislature amended the statute to confer standing on two distinct classes of plaintiffs. See Public Acts 1975, No. 75-618, \u00a7 5 (P.A. 75-618). As amended, the statute provided that CUTPA actions can be brought either by \"any person who purchases or leases goods or services from a seller or lessor primarily for personal,\n   family or household purposes and thereby suffers any ascertainable loss ... as a result\" or by \"[a]ny person who suffers any ascertainable loss of money or property, real or personal, as a result [of a prohibited practice] ....\" P.A. 75-618, \u00a7 5, codified as amended at General Statutes (Rev. to 1977) \u00a7 42-110g (a). In other words, the legislature conferred standing on an additional category of plaintiffs, namely, those whose injuries were not the result of a direct consumer purchase or lease of goods or services. Presumably recognizing that the original category of CUTPA plaintiffs (consumer direct purchasers and lessors) had become redundant insofar as it was merely a subset of the new, broader category that had been added in the 1975 amendments-i.e., any person who suffers an injury as a result of a prohibited practice-the legislature amended the statute again in 1979 to eliminate the reference to direct purchasers. See Public Acts 1979, No. 79-210, \u00a7 1, codified at General Statutes (Rev. to 1981) \u00a7 42-110g (a). As we previously have explained; see\n   <em>\n    Vacco\n   </em>\n   v.\n   <em>\n    Microsoft Corp.\n   </em>\n   ,\n   <extracted-citation case-ids=\"831998\" index=\"35\" url=\"https://cite.case.law/conn/260/59/\">\n    260 Conn. 59\n   </extracted-citation>\n   , 86-87 and n.30,\n   <extracted-citation index=\"36\" url=\"https://cite.case.law/citations/?q=793%20A.2d%201048\">\n    793 A.2d 1048\n   </extracted-citation>\n   (2002) ; it is clear from this history that, although a business relationship initially was required to bring a CUTPA action, the legislature chose to eliminate that privity requirement and instead conferred standing on any person who could establish an ascertainable loss as a result of an unfair trade practice.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-95\">\n   This conclusion finds additional support in the legislative proceedings pertaining to the various 1970s amendments. From the start, CUTPA prohibited unfair trade practices associated not only with the actual sale and distribution of products and services, but also with the advertising and offering of those products and services for sale.\n   <footnotemark>\n    26\n   </footnotemark>\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-96\">\n   However, when the House of Representatives debated Substitute House Bill No. 5613, the bill that ultimately became No. 78346 of the 1978 Public Acts, several representatives expressed concerns that the original file copy of that bill might be understood to mean that unfair advertising would no longer constitute a prohibited trade practice. In explaining the need to amend the bill, Representative Raymond C. Ferrari cautioned that CUTPA should not be watered down so as to \"require the actual sale of an item as opposed to simply allow[ing] the enforcement under an advertisement ....\" 21 H.R. Proc., Pt. 10, 1978 Sess., p. 3987. Representative Robert F. Frankel expressed similar sentiments.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-97\">\n   See 21 H.R. Proc., Pt. 11, 1978 Sess., p. 4319 (\"we would actually be rolling back some of the coverage of [CUTPA] wherein we would be requiring a sale of advertised products before the Commissioner [of Consumer Protection] could become involved\"). The fact that the legislature sought to ensure that advertising alone-even advertising that never results in a sale-could constitute a prohibited practice suggests that an actual business relationship was not deemed to be a precondition for a CUTPA action following the 1975 amendments.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-98\">\n   It is true that the primary concern of those representatives during the 1978 hearings was to prevent the Department of Consumer Protection (department) from being stripped of its authority to aggressively enforce CUTPA violations relating to false or misleading advertising. It is, of course, possible that the legislature wanted the department to be able to curtail wrongful advertising campaigns at their inception, without having to wait until consumers were harmed before taking legal action, but intended that private individuals not have standing to sue unless and until they had purchased goods or services in reliance on such advertisements. It bears emphasis, however, that the legislative history of CUTPA is replete not only with references\n   to the broad scope and remedial nature of the act\n   <footnotemark>\n    27\n   </footnotemark>\n   but also with statements specifically indicating a legislative awareness that the department and the Office of the Attorney General were not equipped to prosecute every unfair trade practice and a concomitant belief that it was important to incentivize broad enforcement action by private litigants.\n   <footnotemark>\n    28\n   </footnotemark>\n   See, e.g.,\n   <em>\n    Hinchliffe\n   </em>\n   v.\n   <em>\n    American Motors Corp.\n   </em>\n   ,\n   <extracted-citation case-ids=\"556250\" index=\"37\" url=\"https://cite.case.law/conn/184/607/\">\n    184 Conn. 607\n   </extracted-citation>\n   , 615 and nn. 4-5, 618,\n   <extracted-citation index=\"38\" url=\"https://cite.case.law/citations/?q=440%20A.2d%20810\">\n    440 A.2d 810\n   </extracted-citation>\n   (1981).\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-99\">\n   More directly on point is the testimony of Assistant Attorney General Arnold Feigen, which was offered on behalf of Attorney General Carl Ajello and Commissioner of Consumer Protection Mary Heslin, before the General Law Committee.

Accordingly,\n   <em>\n    Vacco\n   </em>\n   stands for the proposition that standing to bring a CUTPA claim will lie only when the purportedly unfair trade practice is alleged to have directly and proximately caused the plaintiff's injuries. This remoteness requirement serves the same function as a privity requirement, as it mitigates any concerns associated with imposing limitless liability on CUTPA defendants'.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-103\">\n   Although our decision in\n   <em>\n    Ventres\n   </em>\n   could be read to suggest that the plaintiff must have a business relationship with the defendant, a closer review indicates that it does not stand for this sweeping proposition. In that case, a land trust and a conservancy (property owners) alleged that the named defendant, Goodspeed Airport, LLC, among other defendants', had violated CUTPA by trespassing on the property owners' land. See\n   <em>\n    Ventres\n   </em>\n   v.\n   <em>\n    Goodspeed Airport, LLC\n   </em>\n   , supra,\n   <extracted-citation case-ids=\"3150610\" index=\"60\" url=\"https://cite.case.law/conn/275/105/\">\n    275 Conn. at 109, 112\n   </extracted-citation>\n   ,\n   <extracted-citation index=\"61\" url=\"https://cite.case.law/citations/?q=881%20A.2d%20937\">\n    881 A.2d 937\n   </extracted-citation>\n   . We concluded, as a matter of law, that, even if the property owners had been able to prove their allegations,\n   none of the alleged conduct would have risen to the level of a CUTPA violation. See id., at 156-58,\n   <extracted-citation index=\"62\" url=\"https://cite.case.law/citations/?q=881%20A.2d%20937\">\n    881 A.2d 937\n   </extracted-citation>\n   .\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-104\">\n   As an alternative, independent basis for upholding the trial court's decision to strike the property owners' CUTPA claims, we briefly considered the property owners' contention that a CUTPA plaintiff is not required to allege any business relationship with a defendant, summarily rejecting that claim on the ground that the property owners had provided no authority for the proposition. Id., at 157-58,\n   <extracted-citation index=\"63\" url=\"https://cite.case.law/citations/?q=881%20A.2d%20937\">\n    881 A.2d 937\n   </extracted-citation>\n   . Significantly, in contrast to the present case,\n   <em>\n    Ventres\n   </em>\n   did not involve allegations that a business relationship between the defendants' and a third party had resulted in the harm alleged. Therefore, we had no occasion to discuss or apply the proximate cause analysis set forth in\n   <em>\n    Vacco\n   </em>\n   . See\n   <em>\n    Vacco\n   </em>\n   v.\n   <em>\n    Microsoft Corp.\n   </em>\n   , supra,\n   <extracted-citation case-ids=\"831998\" index=\"64\" url=\"https://cite.case.law/conn/260/59/\">\n    260 Conn. at 90-92\n   </extracted-citation>\n   ,\n   <extracted-citation index=\"65\" url=\"https://cite.case.law/citations/?q=793%20A.2d%201048\">\n    793 A.2d 1048\n   </extracted-citation>\n   . In other words, there was no business relationship that could result in any causal connection to the injury alleged.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-105\">\n   Accordingly, the court in\n   <em>\n    Ventres\n   </em>\n   did not hold that every CUTPA claim requires a business relationship between a plaintiff and a defendant. Indeed, we did not analyze that issue, and at no point did we examine either the text or the legislative history of the statute, both of which, as we previously explained, strongly suggest that the legislature did not intend to impose a privity requirement. We thus conclude that the principles of stare decisis and legislative acquiescence do not preclude us from construing \u00a7 42-110g (a) de novo in the present case to address this question.

The defendants' contend that similar policy rationales counsel in favor of imposing a business relationship requirement. In two of the cases that the defendants' cite in support of this proposition, however, this court concluded that CUTPA simply did not govern the conduct at issue, and, therefore, we did not consider the question of standing.

Accordingly, the cases that the defendants' cite, which address unique professional service contexts and relationships, provide little support for the general proposition that CUTPA does not confer standing outside the limited confines of a business relationship between the CUTPA plaintiff and defendant.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-107\">\n   We need not decide today whether there are other contexts or situations in which parties who do not share a consumer, commercial, or competitor relationship with an alleged wrongdoer may be barred, for prudential or policy reasons, from bringing a CUTPA action. What is clear is that none of the rationales that underlie the standing doctrine, either generally or\n   in the specific context of unfair trade practice litigation, supports the denial of standing to the plaintiffs in this case. \"Standing ... is a practical concept designed to ensure that courts and parties are not vexed by suits brought to\n   vindicate nonjusticable interests and that judicial decisions [that] may affect the rights of others are forged in hot controversy, with each view fairly and vigorously represented.\" (Internal quotation marks omitted.)\n   <em>\n    Slimp\n   </em>\n   v.\n   <em>\n    Dept. of Liquor Control\n   </em>\n   ,\n   <extracted-citation case-ids=\"300332\" index=\"76\" url=\"https://cite.case.law/conn/239/599/#p609\">\n    239 Conn. 599\n   </extracted-citation>\n   , 609,\n   <extracted-citation index=\"77\" url=\"https://cite.case.law/citations/?q=687%20A.2d%20123\">\n    687 A.2d 123\n   </extracted-citation>\n   (1996).

Second, recognizing claims by the indirectly injured would require courts to adopt complicated rules apportioning damages among plaintiffs removed at different levels of injury from the violative acts, in order to avoid the risk of multiple recoveries.

Moreover, we observed that one easily could identify several sets of potential plaintiffs who were more directly harmed by the defendants' alleged misconduct than was the city: \"[A]ll [of] the\n   homeowners in Bridgeport who have been deceived by the defendants' misleading advertising, all of the persons who have been assaulted or killed by the misuse of the handguns, and all of the families of the persons who committed suicide using those handguns.\" Id., at 359,\n   <extracted-citation index=\"83\" url=\"https://cite.case.law/citations/?q=780%20A.2d%2098\">\n    780 A.2d 98\n   </extracted-citation>\n   .\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-109\">\n   In the present case, by contrast, the plaintiffs allege that the defendants' wrongful advertising magnified the lethality of the Sandy Hook massacre by inspiring Lanza or causing him to select a more efficiently deadly weapon for his attack. Proving such a causal link at trial may prove to be a Herculean task.\n   <footnotemark>\n    29\n   </footnotemark>\n   But if it can be proven-and the posture in which this case reaches us requires that we assume it can\n   <footnotemark>\n    30\n   </footnotemark>\n   -the link between the allegedly\n   wrongful conduct and the plaintiffs' injuries would be far more direct and less attenuated than in\n   <em>\n    Ganim\n   </em>\n   .\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-110\">\n   More fundamentally, in this case, unlike in\n   <em>\n    Ganim\n   </em>\n   , it is the direct victims of gun violence who are challenging\n   the defendants' conduct; no private party is better situated than the plaintiffs to bring the action. A claim that a defendant's advertisements unethically promote illegal conduct is fundamentally different from one alleging false or misleading advertising. The primary harm associated with the latter is that a consumer will rely to his or her detriment on the advertiser's representations; it is in the misinformed purchase of the product or service that the wrong becomes fully manifest. Actual customers, then, typically will be the parties most directly and adversely impacted by the alleged wrong.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-111\">\n   The gravamen of a wrongful advertising claim, by contrast, is that an advertisement models or encourages illegal or unsafe behavior. In such instances, the immediate victims are just as likely to be third parties who are not customers, whether it be individuals who engage in inappropriate conduct inspired by the advertisements or the direct victims of that conduct. For example, when an especially racy sports car commercial disclaims, \"professional driver, closed course, do not attempt this at home,\" the perceived risk is not merely-or even primarily-that viewers will purchase that particular vehicle and drive it unsafely as a result of the commercial. Of at least equal concern is the possibility that noncustomer viewers will emulate the commercial when driving their own vehicles, violating motor vehicle laws, and possibly causing injury to themselves or others, including passengers or pedestrians.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-112\">\n   In the present case, the wrong charged is that the defendants' promoted the use of their civilian assault rifles for offensive, military style attack missions. The most directly foreseeable harm associated with such advertising is that innocent third parties could be shot as a result. The decedents are the ones who got shot.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-113\">\n   If the defendants' marketing materials did in fact inspire or intensify the massacre, then there are no\n   more direct victims than these plaintiffs; nor is there any customer of the defendants' with a better claim to standing. That is to say, if these plaintiffs cannot test the legality of the defendants' advertisements pursuant to \u00a7 42-110g, then no one can. For these reasons, we conclude that the trial court improperly determined that the plaintiffs lack standing to assert wrongful death claims predicated on the defendants' alleged CUTPA violations.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-114\">\n   B\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-115\">\n   Statute of Limitations\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-116\">\n   Having concluded that the plaintiffs have standing to bring the present action, we must turn our attention to whether the judgment of the trial court dismissing the plaintiffs' action may be affirmed on an alternative ground. Although its determination that the plaintiffs lacked standing to\n   bring wrongful death claims predicated on alleged CUTPA violations disposed of the case before it, the trial court considered, in the interest of completeness, the defendants' arguments regarding the legal sufficiency of the plaintiffs' CUTPA claims. We first consider the defendants' argument that the plaintiffs' claims are time barred because they did not comply with CUTPA's three year statute of limitations.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-117\">\n   1\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-118\">\n   Procedural History\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-119\">\n   The following additional procedural history is relevant to this claim. The complaint alleges that Lanza's mother purchased the rifle in question in March, 2010, and that it was manufactured and distributed sometime prior to that date. Lanza carried out the Sandy Hook massacre on December 14, 2012, on which date all of the decedents died. The plaintiffs delivered their summons and complaint to a state marshal on December 13, 2014.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-120\">\n   The defendants' moved to strike the plaintiffs' wrongful death claims on the theory that those claims are predicated on underlying CUTPA violations and that private actions brought pursuant to CUTPA are subject to a three year statute of limitations. See General Statutes \u00a7 42-110g (f).\n   <footnotemark>\n    31\n   </footnotemark>\n   They argued that, because all of the relevant transfers of the rifle occurred no later than March, 2010, and because the present action was not initiated until more than four years later, in December, 2014, the plaintiffs' CUTPA claims are time barred.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-121\">\n   The trial court, like the defendants', proceeded on the theory that the date of the alleged CUTPA violations was, at the very latest, March, 2010, when the Riverview defendants' sold the rifle to Lanza's mother. The court was not persuaded, however, that CUTPA is the controlling statute of limitations for purposes of the present action. Rather, the court emphasized that, although the plaintiffs' claims were predicated on a theory of liability sounding in unfair trade practices, those claims were\n   <em>\n    brought\n   </em>\n   pursuant to \u00a7 52-555, the wrongful death statute. That statute has its own statute of limitations, which requires that a wrongful death action \"be brought ... within two years from the date of death,\" and its own statute of repose, which requires that a wrongful death action \"be brought [no] more than five years from the date of the act or omission complained of.\" General Statutes \u00a7 52-555 (a). Because process was served within two years of the date of the decedents' deaths and within five years of the date on which the rifle was sold, the court concluded that the action would not be time barred if the statute of limitations contained in \u00a7 52-555 (a) controls.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-122\">\n   The trial court therefore sought to resolve the apparent conflict between the statutes of limitations contained\n   in \u00a7\u00a7 42-110g (f) and 52-555 (a).

Because the court concluded that the CUTPA statute of limitations did not apply, and because the action was brought within two years of the\n   decedents' deaths and within five years of the initial sale of the rifle, the court also concluded that the plaintiffs' wrongful death claims were timely. Accordingly, the court did not have reason to consider whether the plaintiffs' claims predicated on a wrongful advertising theory of liability, which could be premised on conduct postdating the sale of the rifle, were timely.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-123\">\n   2\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-124\">\n   Legal Principles\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-125\">\n   Turning to the governing legal principles, we first consider whether the trial court correctly determined that, when a wrongful death claim is predicated on an underlying theory of liability that is subject to its own statute of limitations, the plaintiffs need only satisfy the statute of limitations contained in \u00a7 52-555 (a). The trial court was correct that, in the ordinary case, \u00a7 52-555 (a) supplies the controlling statute of limitations regardless of the underlying theory of liability.

The legislative history of the 1991 amendments to the wrongful death statute reflecting the current statutory language; Public Acts 1991, No. 91-238, \u00a7 1; makes clear that\n   <em>\n    Giambozi\n   </em>\n   continues to accurately reflect the intent of the legislature in this respect.

For such statutes, we have said that the limitations provision \"embodies an essential element of the cause of action created-a condition attached to the right to sue at all. The liability and the remedy are created by the same statutes, and the limitations of the remedy are, therefore, to be treated as limitations of the right.... It follows that the statutory provision or provisions prescribing the limitation must be strictly observed if liability is to attach to the claimed offender.

Rather, their claims are wrongful death claims, for which CUTPA merely provides the underlying theory of wrongfulness.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-127\">\n   That argument, although perhaps facially attractive, is precluded by a long line of cases holding that Connecticut's wrongful death statute does not create a new cause of action, independent of any claims that the decedent might have had during his or her life. Rather, the wrongful death statute merely allows the administrator of an estate to append to an already valid claim an additional element of damages consisting of costs associated with the decedent's death.

A necessary consequence of this principle is that a cause of action for wrongful death predicated on a CUTPA violation will lie only insofar as the decedent, had he or she survived, could have satisfied all of the essential elements of the CUTPA claim.

Keeton et al., Prosser and Keeton on the Law of Torts (5th Ed. 1984) \u00a7 127, p. 955 (\"[t]he wrongful death action for the benefit of survivors is, like other actions based on injuries to others, derivative in nature, arising out of and dependent [on] the wrong done to the injured person and thus barred when his claim would be barred\" [footnote omitted] ). It is clear, then, that the plaintiffs' wrongful death claims must comply not only with the statute of limitations that governs wrongful death actions but also with CUTPA's statute of limitations. Accordingly, because it is undisputed that the manufacture, distribution, and final sale of the rifle to Lanza's mother all occurred at least three years prior to the commencement of the present action, we conclude that the trial court should have struck as time barred the plaintiffs' wrongful death claims predicated on a theory that any sale to the civilian market of military style assault weapons such as the AR-15 represents an unfair trade practice. Cf. footnote 14 of this opinion.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-128\">\n   That determination, however, is not fatal to all of the plaintiffs' claims. As we discussed, the plaintiffs also pleaded, in the alternative, that the defendants' violated CUTPA by advertising and marketing the XM15-E2S in an unethical, oppressive, immoral, and unscrupulous manner. Although the complaint does not specifically\n   allege on what dates or over what period of time such marketing activities occurred, most of the plaintiffs' wrongful marketing claims are phrased in the present tense and, therefore, may be understood\n   to allege that those activities continued through the time the complaint was filed. In addition, the plaintiffs' allegation that Lanza selected the XM15-E2S on the morning of the assault \"because of its marketed association with the military\" reasonably could be interpreted to mean that such marketing schemes remained in place at the time of the massacre, during the limitation period. Accordingly, because we are compelled to construe the complaint liberally, in the manner most favorable to sustaining its legal sufficiency, we conclude that, for present purposes, the plaintiffs' wrongful advertising theory is not barred by CUTPA's statute of limitations.\n   <footnotemark>\n    32\n   </footnotemark>\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-129\">\n   C\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-130\">\n   Connecticut Product Liability Act Preemption\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-131\">\n   We next consider whether the trial court correctly determined that \u00a7 52-572n (a), the exclusivity provision of the Product Liability Act, does not bar the plaintiffs' CUTPA claims. Section 52-572n (a) provides that \"[a] product liability claim as provided in [the Product Liability Act] may be asserted and shall be in lieu of all other claims against product sellers, including actions of negligence, strict liability and warranty, for harm caused by a product.\" The defendants' contend that all of the plaintiffs' CUTPA claims ultimately boil down to the argument that the XM15-E2S is unreasonably dangerous for sale to the civilian market and, therefore, that manufacturers and distributors of that weapon should be held strictly liable for any injuries resulting\n   from its misuse.

See part IV B of this opinion. For that reason, the plaintiffs\n   can prevail on their CUTPA based wrongful death claims only if CUTPA permits the recovery of damages for the decedents' injuries. As a matter of first impression, we hold that CUTPA permits recovery for personal injuries that result directly from wrongful advertising practices.\n   <footnotemark>\n    35\n   </footnotemark>\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-140\">\n   Whether personal injuries give rise to cognizable CUTPA damages presents a question of statutory interpretation. We begin by setting forth the relevant statutory language. Subsection (a) of \u00a7 42-110g contains two clauses potentially relevant to the issue before us. First, subsection (a) creates a private right of action for \"[a]ny person who suffers any ascertainable loss of money or property, real or personal, as a result of the use or employment of a method, act or practice prohibited by section 42-110b....\" This provision is known as the ascertainable loss clause. Second, subsection (a) provides that any person so injured \"may bring an action ... to recover actual damages.\" This provision of subsection (a) is known as the actual damages clause.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-141\">\n   The view of the plaintiffs is that these two clauses serve distinct, independent functions within the statute and that only the actual damages clause restricts the types of damages that are available. Specifically, they contend that, although one must suffer some ascertainable loss of money or property in order to have\n   <em>\n    standing\n   </em>\n   to bring a CUTPA action, once the standing requirements set by the ascertainable loss clause have been satisfied, a successful plaintiff may\n   <em>\n    recover\n   </em>\n   not only for those financial losses but for any and all actual damages.

Certainly, they contend, that term is sufficiently expansive to encompass personal injuries.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-142\">\n   The defendants', by contrast, argue that the ascertainable loss clause modifies and cabins the meaning of the actual damages clause. In their view, the fact that a plaintiff must have suffered some manner of financial loss to bring a CUTPA action implies that the legislature intended to limit recovery to damages of that sort. Insofar as both of these interpretations of the statutory language are facially plausible,\n   <footnotemark>\n    36\n   </footnotemark>\n   we conclude that the statute is ambiguous\n   and that we may properly look to extratextual sources to ascertain the intent of the legislature. See General Statutes \u00a7 1-2z.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-143\">\n   The legislative histories of CUTPA and of the model legislation on which CUTPA is based are largely silent with respect to the question of personal injury damages. R. Langer et al., 12 Connecticut Practice Series: Connecticut Unfair Trade Practices, Business Torts and Antitrust (2018-19 Ed.) \u00a7 6.7, pp. 849, 851. Nevertheless, four considerations persuade us that the legislature did not intend to bar plaintiffs from recovering for personal injuries resulting from unfair trade practices, at least under circumstances such as those presented here.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-144\">\n   First, although both the plaintiffs' and the defendants' interpretations of the statutory language are facially plausible, the plaintiffs' reading of \u00a7 42-110g (a) is more reasonable. While the term \"actual damages\" is not defined in CUTPA, the term is used in other statutes in such a manner as to leave no doubt that actual damages include personal injuries. For example,\n   General Statutes \u00a7 53-452 (a) provides in relevant part that \"[a]ny person whose property\n   <em>\n    or person\n   </em>\n   is injured by [a computer crime committed in violation of] section 53-451 may bring a civil action in the Superior Court to enjoin further violations and to recover the\n   <em>\n    actual damages\n   </em>\n   sustained by reason of such violation ....\" (Emphasis added.)\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-145\">\n   In addition, the plaintiffs' interpretation of the statute better comports with our analysis in\n   <em>\n    Hinchliffe\n   </em>\n   v.\n   <em>\n    American Motors Corp.\n   </em>\n   , supra,\n   <extracted-citation case-ids=\"556250\" index=\"148\" url=\"https://cite.case.law/conn/184/607/\">\n    184 Conn. at 612-20\n   </extracted-citation>\n   ,\n   <extracted-citation index=\"149\" url=\"https://cite.case.law/citations/?q=440%20A.2d%20810\">\n    440 A.2d 810\n   </extracted-citation>\n   . In that case, we considered the closely related question of whether the \"ascertainable loss\" requirement means that a CUTPA plaintiff must be able to prove that he or she has suffered actual damages in a particular amount. Id., at 612-13,\n   <extracted-citation index=\"150\" url=\"https://cite.case.law/citations/?q=440%20A.2d%20810\">\n    440 A.2d 810\n   </extracted-citation>\n   . We rejected that reading of the statute, concluding that the ascertainable loss and actual damage clauses of \u00a7 42-110g (a) serve distinct purposes and that the legislature did not intend the term \"ascertainable\" to modify \"actual damages.\" Id., at 613-15,\n   <extracted-citation index=\"151\" url=\"https://cite.case.law/citations/?q=440%20A.2d%20810\">\n    440 A.2d 810\n   </extracted-citation>\n   . We also cited favorably the view of one legal scholar that \"the only function served by a threshold 'loss' requirement in a consumer protection statute is to guard against vicarious suits by self-constituted attorneys general when they spot an apparently deceptive advertisement in the newspaper, on television or in a store window.\"\n   <extracted-citation index=\"152\" url=\"https://cite.case.law/citations/?q=440%20A.2d%20810\">\n    Id.,\n   </extracted-citation>\n   615 n.6,\n   <extracted-citation index=\"153\" url=\"https://cite.case.law/citations/?q=440%20A.2d%20810\">\n    440 A.2d 810\n   </extracted-citation>\n   , citing D. Rice, \"New Private Remedies for Consumers: The Amendment of Chapter 93A,\" 54 Mass. L.Q. 307, 314 (1969). That view, if correct, strongly supports the conclusion that the presence of the ascertainable loss clause in the statute in no way restricts the damages that are available to plaintiffs who have been directly and personally injured by an unfair trade practice.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-146\">\n   Second, we frequently have remarked that \"CUTPA's coverage is broad and its purpose remedial.\" (Internal quotation marks omitted.)\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-147\">\n   <em>\n    Cheshire Mortgage Service, Inc.\n   </em>\n   v.\n   <em>\n    Montes\n   </em>\n   ,\n   <extracted-citation case-ids=\"527670\" index=\"154\" url=\"https://cite.case.law/conn/223/80/#p113\">\n    223 Conn. 80\n   </extracted-citation>\n   , 113-14,\n   <extracted-citation index=\"155\" url=\"https://cite.case.law/citations/?q=612%20A.2d%201130\">\n    612 A.2d 1130\n   </extracted-citation>\n   (1992) ; see also 12 R. Langer et al., supra, \u00a7 2.5, p. 81. As we explained in part IV A of this opinion, whereas unfair trade practices such as false advertising and other forms of commercial deception tend to result primarily in financial harm, a principal evil associated with unethical and unscrupulous advertising is that viewers or innocent third parties will be physically injured as a result of dangerous or illegal conduct depicted\n   in the advertisements. See, e.g.,\n   <em>\n    Lorillard Tobacco Co.\n   </em>\n   v.\n   <em>\n    Reilly\n   </em>\n   ,\n   <extracted-citation case-ids=\"9313455\" index=\"156\" url=\"https://cite.case.law/us/533/525/#p556\">\n    533 U.S. 525\n   </extracted-citation>\n   , 556-61,\n   <extracted-citation case-ids=\"9313455\" index=\"157\" url=\"https://cite.case.law/us/533/525/#p556\">\n    121 S.Ct. 2404\n   </extracted-citation>\n   ,\n   <extracted-citation case-ids=\"9313455\" index=\"158\" url=\"https://cite.case.law/us/533/525/#p556\">\n    150 L.Ed.2d 532\n   </extracted-citation>\n   (2001). That is precisely what the plaintiffs in the present case allege. If personal injuries are not recoverable under those circumstances, then no recovery will be available for a substantial category of unfair trade practices, and the threat of private litigation will not serve as a deterrent to such conduct. That outcome would be inconsistent with the stated intent of the legislature to provide broad protection from unfair trade practices and to incentivize private enforcement of the law.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-148\">\n   Third, it is well established that the legislature intended that Federal Trade Commission (FTC) rulings and cases decided under the Federal Trade Commission Act (FTC Act),\n   <extracted-citation index=\"159\" url=\"https://cite.case.law/citations/?q=15%20U.S.C.%20%C2%A7%2041\">\n    15 U.S.C. \u00a7 41\n   </extracted-citation>\n   et seq.

The FTC concluded that such marketing activities had the tendency to induce behavior that involves an unreasonable risk of harm to person or property and, therefore, constituted unfair trade practices.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-151\">\n   In 1997, Federal Trade Commissioner Roscoe B. Starek III underscored the FTC's interest in combating unfair trade practices that may result in physical injuries to children: \"Although injury must be both substantial and likely\" to draw the FTC's attention, \"unwarranted health or safety risks can suffice.\" R. Starek III, \"The ABCs at the FTC: Marketing and Advertising to Children,\" Address at the Minnesota Institute of Legal Education (July 25, 1997), available at https://www.ftc.gov/public-statements/1997/07/abcs-ftc-marketing-and-advertising-children (last visited March 8, 2019). More recently, the FTC has taken an interest in the marketing of violent movies, songs, and video games to children. See, e.g., Federal Trade Commission, Report to Congress, \"Marketing Violent Entertainment to Children: A Sixth Follow-up Review of Industry Practices in the Motion Picture, Music Recording &amp; Electronic Game Industries (December, 2009), available at\n   <extracted-citation index=\"171\" url=\"https://cite.case.law/citations/?q=2009%20WL%205427633\">\n    2009 WL 5427633\n   </extracted-citation>\n   . It is clear, then, that wrongful advertising that poses a genuine risk of physical harm falls under the broad purview of the FTC Act and, by incorporation, CUTPA.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-152\">\n   Fourth, we observe that courts in several of our sister states have concluded that victims of unfair trade practices may recover for personal injuries. See, e.g.,\n   <em>\n    Pope\n   </em>\n   v.\n   <em>\n    Rollins Protective Services Co.\n   </em>\n   ,\n   <extracted-citation case-ids=\"1851772\" index=\"172\" url=\"https://cite.case.law/f2d/703/197/#p203\">\n    703 F.2d 197\n   </extracted-citation>\n   , 203 (5th Cir. 1983) (applying Texas law) ;\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-153\">\n   <em>\n    Maurer\n   </em>\n   v.\n   <em>\n    Cerkvenik-Anderson Travel, Inc.\n   </em>\n   ,\n   <extracted-citation case-ids=\"1466317\" index=\"173\" url=\"https://cite.case.law/ariz/181/294/#p297\">\n    181 Ariz. 294\n   </extracted-citation>\n   , 297-98,\n   <extracted-citation case-ids=\"1466317\" index=\"174\" url=\"https://cite.case.law/ariz/181/294/#p297\">\n    890 P.2d 69\n   </extracted-citation>\n   (App. 1994) ;\n   <em>\n    Maillet\n   </em>\n   v.\n   <em>\n    ATF-Davidson Co.\n   </em>\n   ,\n   <extracted-citation case-ids=\"3886538\" index=\"175\" url=\"https://cite.case.law/mass/407/185/#p192\">\n    407 Mass. 185\n   </extracted-citation>\n   , 192,\n   <extracted-citation index=\"176\" url=\"https://cite.case.law/citations/?q=552%20N.E.2d%2095\">\n    552 N.E.2d 95\n   </extracted-citation>\n   (1990). Although we recognize that the statutory language at issue in those cases was not identical to the language at issue in this case, we nevertheless find it significant that sister courts have understood personal injuries to fall within the scope of the harms to which broadly worded consumer protection statutes are directed. In addition, we note that a majority of Connecticut trial courts addressing the issue have concluded that damages for personal injuries can be recovered under CUTPA. 12 R. Langer et al., supra, \u00a7 6.7, p. 850. For all of these reasons, we conclude that, at least with respect to wrongful advertising claims, personal injuries alleged to have resulted directly from such advertisements are cognizable under CUTPA.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-154\">\n   V\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-155\">\n   WRONGFUL DEATH AND CUTPA: ISSUES OF FEDERAL LAW\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-156\">\n   Having concluded that the plaintiffs have pleaded legally cognizable CUTPA claims sounding in wrongful marketing, we next consider whether the trial court properly determined that PLCAA does not bar the plaintiffs' wrongful death claims. Our review of the federal statute persuades us that the trial court correctly concluded that CUTPA, as applied to the plaintiffs' allegations, falls within one of PLCAA's exceptions.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-157\">\n   A\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-158\">\n   PLCAA Overview\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-159\">\n   PLCAA generally affords manufacturers\n   and sellers of firearms\n   <footnotemark>\n    39\n   </footnotemark>\n   immunity from civil liability arising from the criminal or unlawful use of their products by third\n   parties.\n   <extracted-citation index=\"177\" url=\"https://cite.case.law/citations/?q=15%20U.S.C.%20%C2%A7%C2%A7%207902\">\n    15 U.S.C. \u00a7\u00a7 7902\n   </extracted-citation>\n   (a) and 7903 (5) (A) (2012).\n   <footnotemark>\n    40\n   </footnotemark>\n   Congress carved out six exceptions to this immunity, pursuant to which firearms sellers may be held liable for third-party crimes committed with their products.

In this part of the opinion, we explain why the plaintiffs' interpretation of the statutory language is plainly the more reasonable one.

See, e.g.,\n   <em>\n    Maslenjak\n   </em>\n   v.\n   <em>\n    United States\n   </em>\n   , --- U.S. ----,\n   <extracted-citation case-ids=\"12605053\" index=\"197\" url=\"https://cite.case.law/s-ct/137/1918/#p1924\">\n    137 S.Ct. 1918\n   </extracted-citation>\n   , 1924,\n   <extracted-citation case-ids=\"12605053\" index=\"198\" url=\"https://cite.case.law/s-ct/137/1918/#p1924\">\n    198 L.Ed.2d 460\n   </extracted-citation>\n   (2017). Looking to dictionaries that were in print around the time PLCAA was enacted, we find that the principal definition of \"applicable\" is simply \"[c]apable of being applied ....\" Black's Law Dictionary (10th Ed. 2014) p. 120; accord Webster's Third New International Dictionary (2002) p. 105.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-168\">\n   If Congress had intended to create an exception to PLCAA for actions alleging a violation of any law that is capable of being applied to the sale and marketing of firearms, then there is little doubt that state consumer protection statutes such as CUTPA would qualify as predicate statutes. CUTPA prohibits \"unfair methods of competition and unfair or deceptive acts or practices in the conduct of\n   <em>\n    any trade or commerce.\n   </em>\n   \" (Emphasis added.) General Statutes \u00a7 42-110b (a). Accordingly, the statute clearly is capable of being applied to the sale and marketing of firearms. The only state appellate court to have reviewed the predicate exception construed it in this manner; see\n   <em>\n    Smith &amp; Wesson Corp.\n   </em>\n   v.\n   <em>\n    Gary\n   </em>\n   ,\n   <extracted-citation case-ids=\"8371265\" index=\"199\" url=\"https://cite.case.law/ne2d/875/422/#p431\">\n    875 N.E.2d 422\n   </extracted-citation>\n   , 431, 434-35 and n.12 (Ind.

Webster's Third New International Dictionary, for example, also defines \"applicable\" as \"fit, suitable, or right to be applied: appropriate ... relevant ....\" Webster's Third New International Dictionary, supra, p. 105. Pursuant to such definitions, the Ninth Circuit concluded, it would not be unreasonable to read PLCAA to exempt only those state laws that are\n   <em>\n    exclusively\n   </em>\n   relevant to the sale or marketing of firearms.

The predicate exception expressly provides that the \"qualified civil liability actions\" from which firearms sellers are immune shall not include \"an action in which a manufacturer or seller of a [firearm] knowingly violated a State or Federal statute applicable to the sale or\n   <em>\n    marketing\n   </em>\n   of the [firearm] ....\"\n   <footnotemark>\n    42\n   </footnotemark>\n   (Emphasis added.)\n   <extracted-citation index=\"207\" url=\"https://cite.case.law/citations/?q=15%20U.S.C.%20%C2%A7%207903\">\n    15 U.S.C. \u00a7 7903\n   </extracted-citation>\n   (5) (A) (iii) (2012).\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-176\">\n   Importantly, however, at the time PLCAA was enacted, no federal statutes directly or specifically\n   regulated the marketing or advertising of firearms. In addition, only a handful of states have enacted firearm specific laws that address in any way the marketing function, and none of those purports to comprehensively regulate the advertising of firearms.\n   <footnotemark>\n    43\n   </footnotemark>\n   It would have made little sense for the drafters of the legislation to carve out an exception for violations of laws applicable to the marketing of firearms if no such laws existed.\n   <footnotemark>\n    44\n   </footnotemark>\n   If Congress intended the predicate exception to encompass laws that prohibit the wrongful marketing of firearms, and if no laws expressly and directly do so, then the only logical reading of the statute is that Congress had some other type of law in mind. What type?

CUTPA falls squarely into both of these categories.\n   Statutes such as the FTC Act and state analogues that prohibit the wrongful marketing of dangerous consumer products such as firearms represent precisely the types of statutes that implicate and have been applied to the sale and marketing of firearms.

In his dissenting opinion, Justice Robinson reads this statement to support the position of the defendants'. On balance, however, we conclude, for the following reasons, that the congressional findings and purposes also lend support to the plaintiffs' interpretation of the statute.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-189\">\n   First, Title 15 of the 2012 edition of the United States Code, \u00a7 7901 (a) (4), provides that \"[t]he\n   <em>\n    manufacture, importation, possession, sale, and use\n   </em>\n   of firearms and ammunition in the United States are heavily regulated by Federal, State, and local laws ... [s]uch [as] ... the Gun Control Act of 1968, the National Firearms Act ... and the Arms Export Control Act ....\" (Citations omitted; emphasis added.) Notably, this provision, which expressly references various firearms specific laws, makes no mention of the marketing function. By contrast, the very next finding expressly references the \"lawful ... marketing ... of firearms ....\"\n   <footnotemark>\n    54\n   </footnotemark>\n   <extracted-citation index=\"228\" url=\"https://cite.case.law/citations/?q=15%20U.S.C.%20%C2%A7%C2%A7%207901\">\n    15 U.S.C. \u00a7 7901\n   </extracted-citation>\n   (a) (5) (2012). Reading these two findings in concert, it is clear that Congress chose not to abrogate the well established duty of firearms sellers to market their wares legally and responsibly, even though no federal laws specifically govern the marketing of firearms.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-190\">\n   Second, although the findings indicate that Congress sought to immunize the firearms industry from liability for third-party criminal conduct, they emphasize that that immunity extended only to \"harm that is\n   <em>\n    solely\n   </em>\n   caused by others ....\" (Emphasis added.)\n   <extracted-citation index=\"229\" url=\"https://cite.case.law/citations/?q=15%20U.S.C.%20%C2%A7%C2%A7%207901\">\n    15 U.S.C. \u00a7 7901\n   </extracted-citation>\n   (a) (6) (2012) ; see also\n   <extracted-citation index=\"230\" url=\"https://cite.case.law/citations/?q=15%20U.S.C.%20%C2%A7%C2%A7%207901\">\n    15 U.S.C. \u00a7 7901\n   </extracted-citation>\n   (b) (1) (2012) (principal purpose of PLCAA is to prohibit causes of action \"for the harm\n   <em>\n    solely\n   </em>\n   caused by the criminal or unlawful misuse of firearm products\" [emphasis added] );\n   <em>\n    Ileto\n   </em>\n   v.\n   <em>\n    Glock, Inc.\n   </em>\n   , supra,\n   <extracted-citation case-ids=\"3641664\" index=\"231\" url=\"https://cite.case.law/f3d/565/1126/#p1133\">\n    565 F.3d at 1158\n   </extracted-citation>\n   (Berzon, J., concurring in part and dissenting in part) (same). The statement of findings and purposes further provides that the purpose of PLCAA is \"[t]o preserve a citizen's access to a supply of firearms and ammunition for all\n   <em>\n    lawful\n   </em>\n   purposes, including hunting, self-defense, collecting, and competitive or recreational shooting.\" (Emphasis added.)\n   <extracted-citation index=\"232\" url=\"https://cite.case.law/citations/?q=15%20U.S.C.%20%C2%A7%C2%A7%207901\">\n    15 U.S.C. \u00a7 7901\n   </extracted-citation>\n   (b) (2) (2012). In the present case, the plaintiffs allege that the defendants'\n   <em>\n    illegally\n   </em>\n   marketed the XM15-E2S by promoting its criminal use for offensive civilian assaults, and that this wrongful advertising was a direct cause of the Sandy Hook massacre. At no time and in no way does the congressional statement indicate that firearm sellers should evade liability for the injuries that result if they promote the illegal use of their products.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-191\">\n   Third, the findings make clear that Congress sought to preclude only novel civil actions that are \"based on theories without foundation in hundreds of years of the common law and jurisprudence of the United States and do not represent a bona fide expansion of the common law,\" recognition of which \"would expand civil liability in a manner never contemplated ... by Congress ... or by the legislatures of the several States.\"\n   <extracted-citation index=\"233\" url=\"https://cite.case.law/citations/?q=15%20U.S.C.%20%C2%A7%C2%A7%207901\">\n    15 U.S.C. \u00a7 7901\n   </extracted-citation>\n   (a) (7) (2012). As we previously discussed, however, it is well established that the FTC Act and state analogues such as CUTPA not only govern the marketing of firearms, but\n   also prohibit advertisements\n   that promote or model the unsafe or illegal use of potentially dangerous products. Accordingly, there is simply no reason to think that the present action represents the sort of novel civil action that Congress sought to bar.\n   <footnotemark>\n    55\n   </footnotemark>\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-192\">\n   The dissent relies on one other provision of the statement of findings and purposes that purportedly disqualifies CUTPA, as applied to the plaintiffs' wrongful marketing theory, as a potential predicate statute. Specifically, the statement emphasizes the importance of preserving the rights enshrined in the second amendment to the United States constitution. See\n   <extracted-citation index=\"234\" url=\"https://cite.case.law/citations/?q=15%20U.S.C.%20%C2%A7%C2%A7%207901\">\n    15 U.S.C. \u00a7 7901\n   </extracted-citation>\n   (a) (1), (2) and (6) (2012).\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-193\">\n   There is no doubt that congressional supporters of PLCAA were committed to Americans' second amendment freedoms and sought to secure those freedoms by immunizing firearms companies from frivolous lawsuits.

Accordingly, Judge Berzon's argument appears to be predicated on the assumptions that (1) most states have public nuisance statutes or similar laws, such as the California nuisance statutes at issue in\n   <em>\n    Ileto\n   </em>\n   , and (2) virtually any action seeking to hold firearms sellers liable for third-party gun violence could allege a colorable violation of those statutes because the mere act of selling the weapons involved might be deemed to create a public nuisance.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-197\">\n   We will assume, without deciding, that Judge Berzon is correct that, as a general matter, the predicate exception cannot be so expansive as to fully encompass laws such as public nuisance statutes insofar as those laws reasonably might be implicated in any civil action arising from gun violence.\n   <footnotemark>\n    57\n   </footnotemark>\n   Although we believe that\n   the plaintiffs' primary allegations-that any sale of assault weapons to the civilian market constitutes an unfair trade practice-would falter on this shoal, we need not address that issue more fully in light of our determination that those allegations are time barred. See part IV B of this opinion. What is clear, however, is that the plaintiffs' wrongful marketing allegations may proceed without crippling PLCAA. Those claims allege only that one specific family of firearms sellers advertised one particular line of assault weapons in a uniquely unscrupulous manner, promoting their suitability for illegal, offensive assaults. As we have stated throughout this opinion, we do not know whether the plaintiffs will be able to prove those allegations to a jury. But we are confident that this sort of specific, narrowly framed wrongful marketing claim alleges precisely the sort of illegal conduct that Congress did not intend to immunize. For this reason, CUTPA's prohibition against such conduct appears to fall squarely within the predicate exception and does not lead to an absurd result.\n   C\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-198\">\n   Extrinsic Evidence of Congressional Intent\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-199\">\n   Other courts that have construed the predicate exception are divided as to whether the exception unambiguously encompasses laws, such as CUTPA, that do not expressly regulate firearms sales and marketing but are nevertheless capable of being and have been applied thereto.

Accordingly, we will find the plaintiffs' CUTPA action to be superseded by PLCAA only if that is the clearly expressed intent of Congress.\n   <footnotemark>\n    58\n   </footnotemark>\n   In the case of PLCAA, there is no indication in the statutory text or statement of findings and purposes that Congress intended to restrict the power of the states to regulate wrongful advertising, particularly advertising that encourages consumers to engage in egregious criminal conduct. Indeed, sponsors of the legislation repeatedly emphasized during the legislative hearings that they did\n   <em>\n    not\n   </em>\n   intend to abrogate well established legal principles.\n   <footnotemark>\n    59\n   </footnotemark>\n   Accordingly, in the absence of a clear statement in the statutory text or legislative history that Congress intended to supersede the states' traditional authority to regulate the wrongful advertising of dangerous products such as firearms, we are compelled to resolve any textual ambiguities in favor of the plaintiffs.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-206\">\n   b\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-207\">\n   Ejusdem Generis\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-208\">\n   The defendants' contend that a different canon of construction, namely, ejusdem generis, essentially resolves any statutory ambiguity in their favor. Specifically, from the fact that PLCAA provides two examples of predicate federal statutes,\n   both of which specifically relate to firearms, the defendants' infer that all predicate\n   statutes must be of that same ilk.\n   <footnotemark>\n    60\n   </footnotemark>\n   We are not persuaded.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-209\">\n   When it drafted the predicate exception, Congress set forth two examples of statutes that are applicable to the sale or marketing of firearms. PLCAA provides that entities engaged in the firearms business are not immune from liability with respect to \"an action in which a manufacturer or seller of a [firearm] knowingly violated a State or Federal statute applicable to the sale or marketing of the [firearm] ... including-\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-210\">\n   \"(I) any case in which the manufacturer or seller knowingly made any false entry in, or failed to make appropriate entry in, any record required to be kept under Federal or State law with respect to the [firearm], or aided, abetted, or conspired with any person in making any false or fictitious oral or written statement with respect to any fact material to the lawfulness of the sale or other disposition of a [firearm]; or\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-211\">\n   \"(II) any case in which the manufacturer or seller aided, abetted, or conspired with any other person to sell or otherwise dispose of a [firearm], knowing, or having reasonable cause to believe, that the actual buyer of the [firearm] was prohibited from possessing or receiving a firearm ... under subsection (g) or (n) of section 922 of title 18 [of the United States Code] ....\"\n   <footnotemark>\n    61\n   </footnotemark>\n   <extracted-citation index=\"282\" url=\"https://cite.case.law/citations/?q=15%20U.S.C.%20%C2%A7%207903\">\n    15 U.S.C. \u00a7 7903\n   </extracted-citation>\n   (5) (A) (iii) (2012) (setting forth record keeping and unlawful buyer exceptions).\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-212\">\n   The defendants' argue that we can discern the scope of the predicate exception by applying ejusdem generis. That canon applies when a statute sets forth a general category of persons or things and then enumerates specific examples thereof. In those cases, when the scope of the general category is unclear, a presumption, albeit a rebuttable one, may arise that the general category encompasses only things similar in nature to the specific examples that follow. See, e.g., 2A N. Singer &amp; S. Singer, Statutes and Statutory Construction (7th Ed. 2014) \u00a7 47:17, pp. 364-68. Several courts have acknowledged the potential relevance of the canon when construing the predicate exception. See, e.g.,\n   <em>\n    New York\n   </em>\n   v.\n   <em>\n    Beretta U.S.A. Corp.\n   </em>\n   , supra,\n   <extracted-citation case-ids=\"3823104\" index=\"283\" url=\"https://cite.case.law/f3d/524/384/#p400\">\n    524 F.3d at 401-402\n   </extracted-citation>\n   .\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-213\">\n   It is well established, however, that ejusdem generis, like other canons of construction, is merely a tool to assist us in gleaning the intent of Congress; it should not be applied in the face of a contrary\n   manifestation of legislative intent.\n   <em>\n    Helvering\n   </em>\n   v.\n   <em>\n    Stockholms Enskilda Bank\n   </em>\n   ,\n   <extracted-citation case-ids=\"3925589\" index=\"284\" url=\"https://cite.case.law/us/293/84/#p88\">\n    293 U.S. 84\n   </extracted-citation>\n   , 88-89,\n   <extracted-citation case-ids=\"3925589\" index=\"285\" url=\"https://cite.case.law/us/293/84/#p88\">\n    55 S.Ct. 50\n   </extracted-citation>\n   ,\n   <extracted-citation case-ids=\"3925589\" index=\"286\" url=\"https://cite.case.law/us/293/84/#p88\">\n    79 L.Ed. 211\n   </extracted-citation>\n   (1934) ; 2A N. Singer &amp; S. Singer, supra, \u00a7 47:22, pp. 400-404. This is particularly true, for example, when the legislative history of a statute reveals a contrary intent. See 2A N. Singer &amp; S. Singer, supra, \u00a7 47:22, pp. 404-405.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-214\">\n   In the case of PLCAA, the legislative history of the statute makes clear why Congress specifically chose to include the record keeping and unlawful buyer exceptions when drafting the final version of the predicate\n   exception. Bills substantially similar to PLCAA had been introduced in both the 107th Congress and the 108th Congress. See S. 1805, 108th Cong. (2003), H.R. 1036, 108th Cong. (2003); H.R. 2037, 107th Cong. (2001). Those bills contained the same exemption for \"State or Federal statute[s] applicable to the sale or marketing of [firearms]\" that ultimately was codified at\n   <extracted-citation index=\"287\" url=\"https://cite.case.law/citations/?q=15%20U.S.C.%20%C2%A7%207903\">\n    15 U.S.C. \u00a7 7903\n   </extracted-citation>\n   (5) (A) (iii). H.R. 2037, supra, \u00a7 4; accord S. 1805, supra, \u00a7 4; H.R. 1036, supra, \u00a7 4. Notably, however, they did not include the record keeping or the unlawful buyer exception. Indeed, they did not offer any specific examples of predicate statutes.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-215\">\n   The legislative history indicates that the record keeping and unlawful buyer illustrations were added to the bill that became law during the 109th Congress not to define or clarify the narrow scope of the exception but, rather, because, in 2002, two snipers had terrorized the District of Columbia and surrounding areas. One of the snipers allegedly stole a Bushmaster XM-15 semiautomatic rifle identical or similar to the one at issue in the present case from a gun dealer with a history of lax inventory control procedures.\n   <footnotemark>\n    62\n   </footnotemark>\n   In 2003, the families of the victims of the sniper attacks brought a civil action against the gun dealer that ultimately resulted in a $ 2.5 million settlement.\n   <footnotemark>\n    63\n   </footnotemark>\n   During the legislative debates, many of the members who spoke in opposition to the bill that ultimately became PLCAA argued that the bill would have prevented victims of the sniper attacks from bringing an action against that gun dealer, even though the dealer's carelessness had allowed the snipers to obtain the assault weapon.\n   <footnotemark>\n    64\n   </footnotemark>\n   Indeed, it was in part for\n   that very reason, and the public outcry over the sniper attacks, that prior versions of the bill failed to pass.\n   <footnotemark>\n    65\n   </footnotemark>\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-216\">\n   To deflect these potent political attacks, the author and other supporters of the 2005 incarnation of the bill pointed to the recently added record keeping and illegal buyer exception language as evidence that victims of the sniper attacks would not have been barred from pursuing their action under the predicate exception.\n   <footnotemark>\n    66\n   </footnotemark>\n   Indeed,\n   several legislators strongly suggested that these examples of predicate statutes were specifically added to PLCAA to make clear that the lawsuits arising from the sniper attacks would not have been barred by PLCAA.\n   <footnotemark>\n    67\n   </footnotemark>\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-217\">\n   The most reasonable interpretation of this legislative history, then, is that the record keeping and unlawful\n   buyer illustrations were included in the final version of PLCAA not in an effort to define, clarify, or narrow the universe of laws that qualify as predicate statutes but, rather, simply to stave off the politically potent attack that PLCAA would have barred lawsuits like the one that had arisen from the widely reported Beltway sniper attacks. There is no other plausible explanation for why Congress chose to modify the predicate exception language contained in the 2001 and 2003 bills, which otherwise was \"virtually identical\" to the language in PLCAA. 151 Cong. Rec. 2561 (2005), remarks of Senator Larry Edwin Craig; see also id., 18,096, remarks of Senator Craig (indicating that bill is same for all intents and purposes as version introduced during 108th Congress, with addition of clarifying examples).\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-218\">\n   This conclusion is bolstered by the fact that Congress was fully aware that there are many types of federal statutes and regulations, filling \"hundreds of pages,\" that specifically govern the firearms industry. 151 Cong. Rec. 18,059 (2005), remarks of Senator Thomas Allen Coburn.

Instead, the author of PLCAA opted to highlight only the two specific subsections of\n   <extracted-citation index=\"290\" url=\"https://cite.case.law/citations/?q=18%20U.S.C.%20%C2%A7%20922\">\n    18 U.S.C. \u00a7 922\n   </extracted-citation>\n   -subsection (g) and (n) -that would have barred the Beltway snipers from obtaining the weapon used in the shootings.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-219\">\n   Under similar circumstances, when it is clear that examples have been included in a statute for purposes of emphasis or in response to recent, high profile events, rather than to restrict the scope of coverage, both the United States Supreme Court and the lower federal courts have declined to apply canons, including ejusdem generis, to construe a statutory provision overly\n   narrowly.\n   <footnotemark>\n    68\n   </footnotemark>\n   For similar reasons, we conclude that the ejusdem generis\n   canon is not applicable to the predicate exception.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-220\">\n   c\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-221\">\n   Statutory Exceptions To Be Construed Narrowly\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-222\">\n   Citing\n   <em>\n    Commissioner of Internal Revenue\n   </em>\n   v.\n   <em>\n    Clark\n   </em>\n   ,\n   <extracted-citation case-ids=\"12033290\" index=\"291\" url=\"https://cite.case.law/us/489/726/#p739\">\n    489 U.S. 726\n   </extracted-citation>\n   , 739,\n   <extracted-citation case-ids=\"12033290\" index=\"292\" url=\"https://cite.case.law/us/489/726/#p739\">\n    109 S.Ct. 1455\n   </extracted-citation>\n   ,\n   <extracted-citation case-ids=\"12033290\" index=\"293\" url=\"https://cite.case.law/us/489/726/#p739\">\n    103 L.Ed.2d 753\n   </extracted-citation>\n   (1989), the defendants' rely on another canon, contending that the predicate exception, like other statutory exceptions, must be construed narrowly to preserve the primary purpose of PLCAA. As we explained, however, our review of the statutory language strongly suggests that the defendants' have misperceived the primary purpose of PLCAA, which is not to shield firearms sellers from liability for wrongful or illegal conduct. If Congress had intended to supersede state actions of this sort, it was required to make that purpose clear.\n   <footnotemark>\n    69\n   </footnotemark>\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-223\">\n   2\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-224\">\n   Related Legislation\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-225\">\n   We also find it instructive that, in early 2005, at approximately the same time that the proposed legislation that ultimately became PLCAA was introduced, bills were introduced in both the House of Representatives\n   and the Senate that would have bestowed PLCAA-type immunity on fast food restaurant companies to protect them from lawsuits seeking to hold them liable for consumers' obesity and related health problems.\n   <footnotemark>\n    70\n   </footnotemark>\n   Both bills contained language that was substantially similar to PLCAA's predicate exception: \"A qualified civil liability action shall not include ... an action based on allegations that ... a manufacturer or seller of [food] knowingly violated a Federal or State statute applicable to the marketing, advertisement, or labeling of [food] with intent for a person to rely on that violation ....\" S. 908, 109th Cong. \u00a7 4 (2005); accord H.R. 554, 109th Cong. \u00a7 4 (2005). The House Report accompanying H.R. 554 made clear that \"applicable\" statutes for purposes of that bill were not limited to laws, such as the Federal Food, Drug and Cosmetic Act;\n   <extracted-citation index=\"294\" url=\"https://cite.case.law/citations/?q=21%20U.S.C.%20%C2%A7%20301\">\n    21 U.S.C. \u00a7 301\n   </extracted-citation>\n   et seq. (2012) ; that directly and specifically regulate the food industry. Rather, the report indicated that state consumer protection laws, such as CUTPA, also qualified as predicate statutes, even though they are laws of general applicability that do not expressly address food and beverage marketing or labeling: \"Every state has its own deceptive trade practices laws, and a knowing violation of any of such state laws could allow suits to go forward under the legislation if the criteria specified ... are met.\"\n   <footnotemark>\n    71\n   </footnotemark>\n   H.R. Rep. No. 109-130, p. 8 (2005).\n   We recognize that these bills never became law and also that food and firearms are different types of products that implicate different risks and concerns.

Although the extensive history of the statute presents something of a mixed bag, our review persuades us that Congress did not intend to limit the scope of the predicate exception to violations of firearms specific laws or to confer immunity from all claims alleging that firearms sellers violated unfair trade practice laws.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-229\">\n   During the legislative debates, opponents of the proposed legislation that became PLCAA repeatedly questioned why it was necessary to confer immunity on the firearms industry when, in their view, only a very small number of gun violence related lawsuits had been filed against firearms manufacturers and distributors, most of which had been dismissed at the trial court level.\n   <footnotemark>\n    73\n   </footnotemark>\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-230\">\n   In response, PLCAA's sponsor and several of PLCAA's cosponsors described the specific types of lawsuits that the legislation was intended to prohibit. See footnotes 74 and 76 of this opinion. They emphasized that their primary concern was not with lawsuits such as the present action, in which individual plaintiffs who have been harmed in a specific incident of gun violence seek to hold the sellers responsible for their specific misconduct in selling the weapons involved. See\n   <extracted-citation index=\"296\" url=\"https://cite.case.law/citations/?q=15%20U.S.C.%20%C2%A7%207903\">\n    id.\n   </extracted-citation>\n   Many proponents indicated that their intent was to preclude the rising number of instances in which municipalities and \"anti-gun activists\" filed \"junk\" or \"frivolous\" lawsuits targeting the entire firearms industry.\n   <footnotemark>\n    74\n   </footnotemark>\n   As one cosponsor of the legislation explained, \"[t]his bill is only intended to protect law-abiding members of the firearms industry from nuisance suits that have no basis in current law, that are only intended to regulate the industry or harass the industry or put it out\n   of business ... which are [not] appropriate purposes for a lawsuit.\"\n   <footnotemark>\n    75\n   </footnotemark>\n   151 Cong. Rec. 18,104 (2005), remarks of Senator Max Sieben Baucus.\n   <footnotemark>\n    76\n   </footnotemark>\n   In the present action, by contrast,\n   the private victims of one specific incident of gun violence seek compensation from the producers and distributors of a single firearm on the basis of alleged misconduct in the specific marketing of that firearm. Few if any of the bill's sponsors indicated that cases of this sort were what PLCAA was intended to preclude.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-231\">\n   In addition, during the course of the legislative debates, many legislators either expressly stated or clearly implied that the only actions that would be barred by PLCAA would be ones in which a defendant bore absolutely no responsibility or blame for a plaintiff's injuries and was, in essence, being held strictly liable for crimes committed with firearms that it had merely produced or distributed. See\n   <em>\n    Ileto\n   </em>\n   v.\n   <em>\n    Glock, Inc.\n   </em>\n   , supra,\n   <extracted-citation case-ids=\"3641664\" index=\"297\" url=\"https://cite.case.law/f3d/565/1126/#p1133\">\n    565 F.3d at 1159\n   </extracted-citation>\n   (Berzon, J., concurring in part and dissenting in part). One cosponsor, for example, emphasized that \"the heart of this bill\" was that one can be held liable for violating a statute during the production, distribution, or sale of firearms, \"[b]ut we are not going to extend it to a concept where you are responsible,\n   <em>\n    after you have done everything right,\n   </em>\n   for what somebody else may do who bought your product and they did it wrong and it is their fault, not yours.\" (Emphasis added.) 151 Cong. Rec. 18,920 (2005), remarks of Senator Lindsey O. Graham. Another cosponsor explained the essential evil to which the bill was directed: \"It is out of that fear and concern that we have mayors and cities passing laws that create strict liability .... [Firearms sellers have] become ... insurer[s] against criminal activity by criminals.\" Id., 18,924, remarks of Senator Jefferson Beauregard Sessions III. Senator Sessions added: \"That is what we are trying to curtail here-this utilization of the legal system ....\" Id.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-232\">\n   A common theme running through supporters' statements was that holding a firearms seller liable for third-party gun violence for which the seller is wholly blameless is no different from holding producers of products such as automobiles, matches, baseball bats, and knives strictly liable when those ubiquitous but potentially dangerous items are inappropriately or illegally used to commit crimes. As the author of PLCAA, Senator Craig, explained: \"If a gun manufacturer is held liable for the harm done by a criminal who misuses a gun, then there is nothing to stop the manufacturers of any product used in crimes from having to bear the costs resulting from the actions of those criminals. So as I mentioned earlier, automobile manufacturers will have to take the blame for the death of a bystander who gets in the way of the drunk driver. The local hardware store will have to be held responsible for a kitchen knife it sold, if later that knife is used in the commission\n   of a rape. The baseball team whose bat was used to bludgeon a victim will have to pay the cost of the crime. The list goes on and on.\" Id., 18,085. The implication of this argument is that legislators' primary concern was that liability should not be imposed in situations in which the producer or distributor of a consumer product bears absolutely no responsibility for the misuse of that product in the commission of a crime. There is no indication that the sponsors of PLCAA believed that sellers of those consumer products should be shielded from liability if, for example, an automobile manufacturer advertised that the safety features of its vehicles made them ideally suited for drunk driving, or if a sporting goods dealer ran advertisements encouraging high school baseball players to hurl their bats at the opposing pitcher in retaliation for an errant pitch. That is, in essence, what the plaintiffs have alleged in the present case.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-233\">\n   To the extent that supporters of PLCAA were concerned with lawsuits other than those seeking to hold\n   firearms sellers strictly liable for gun violence, they consistently expressed that their intention was to foreclose novel legal theories that had been developed by anti-gun activists with the goal of putting firearms sellers out of business.\n   <footnotemark>\n    77\n   </footnotemark>\n   The author of the legislation explained as follows: \"As we have stressed repeatedly, this legislation will not bar the courthouse doors to victims who have been harmed by the negligence or misdeeds of anyone in the gun industry. Well recognized causes of action are protected by the bill. Plaintiffs can still argue their cases for violations of law .... The only lawsuits this legislation seeks to prevent are novel causes of action that have no history or grounding in legal principle.\" Id., 18,096, remarks of Senator Craig. In addition, a number of lawmakers emphasized that the legislation was primarily directed at heading off unprecedented\n   <em>\n    tort\n   </em>\n   theories,\n   <footnotemark>\n    78\n   </footnotemark>\n   which explains why the predicate exception expressly preserved liability for statutory violations. See\n   <em>\n    Ileto\n   </em>\n   v.\n   <em>\n    Glock, Inc.\n   </em>\n   , supra,\n   <extracted-citation case-ids=\"3641664\" index=\"298\" url=\"https://cite.case.law/f3d/565/1126/#p1133\">\n    565 F.3d at 1135\n   </extracted-citation>\n   (\"Congress clearly intended to preempt common-law claims, such as general tort theories of liability\");\n   <extracted-citation case-ids=\"3641664\" index=\"299\" url=\"https://cite.case.law/f3d/565/1126/#p1133\">\n    id., at 1160-61\n   </extracted-citation>\n   (Berzon, J., concurring in part and dissenting in part) (\"[PLCAA] was viewed essentially as a [tort reform] measure, aimed at restraining the supposed expansion of tort liability\").\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-234\">\n   As we discussed previously, the plaintiffs' theory of liability is not novel; nor does it sound in tort.\n   <footnotemark>\n    79\n   </footnotemark>\n   The\n   plaintiffs\n   allege that the defendants' engaged in unfair trade practices in violation of CUTPA, a statute that was enacted in 1973. See P.A. 73-615. Furthermore, CUTPA, by its express terms, is modeled on the FTC Act; see General Statutes \u00a7 42-110b (b) ; which has been in effect for more than one century. See Act of September 26, 1914, Pub. L. No. 63-203,\n   <extracted-citation index=\"300\" url=\"https://cite.case.law/citations/?q=38%20Stat.%20717\">\n    38 Stat. 717\n   </extracted-citation>\n   . As we explained, the FTC Act and its state counterparts have long been used to regulate not only the sale and marketing of firearms but also claims that sellers of other dangerous products have advertised their wares in a manner that modeled or promoted unsafe behavior and created an unreasonable risk that viewers would engage in unsafe or illegal conduct.\n   <footnotemark>\n    80\n   </footnotemark>\n   The defendants', purporting to rely on the decision of the Ninth Circuit in\n   <em>\n    Ileto\n   </em>\n   , argue that the legislative history of PLCAA supports a more restrictive view of the scope of the predicate exception. We read\n   <em>\n    Ileto\n   </em>\n   differently. As we noted; see footnote 47 of this opinion; the court in that case concluded that \"congressional speakers' statements concerning the scope of ... PLCAA reflected the understanding that manufacturers and sellers of firearms would be liable only for statutory violations concerning firearm[s] regulations\n   <em>\n    or sales and marketing regulations\n   </em>\n   .\" (Emphasis added.)\n   <em>\n    Ileto\n   </em>\n   v.\n   <em>\n    Glock, Inc.\n   </em>\n   , supra,\n   <extracted-citation case-ids=\"3641664\" index=\"301\" url=\"https://cite.case.law/f3d/565/1126/#p1133\">\n    565 F.3d at 1137\n   </extracted-citation>\n   . Because CUTPA specifically regulates commercial sales and marketing activities such as those at issue in the present case; see, e.g.,\n   <em>\n    Izzarelli\n   </em>\n   v.\n   <em>\n    R.J. Reynolds Tobacco Co.\n   </em>\n   ,\n   <extracted-citation case-ids=\"11223173\" index=\"302\" url=\"https://cite.case.law/f-supp-2d/117/167/#p178\">\n    117 F.Supp.2d 167\n   </extracted-citation>\n   , 178 (D. Conn. 2000) ; it falls squarely within the predicate exception, as\n   <em>\n    Ileto\n   </em>\n   construed the legislative history.\n   We do not dispute that, over the course of the hundreds of pages of coverage of the legislative debates, a few congressional supporters of PLCAA made a few brief references to predicate statutes as being firearms specific.\n   <footnotemark>\n    81\n   </footnotemark>\n   What the defendants' have overlooked, however,\n   are the dozens of statements by PLCAA's drafter and cosponsors that imply or directly state that the predicate exception applies far more broadly, such that firearms companies may be held liable for violation of\n   <em>\n    any\n   </em>\n   applicable law, and not only those laws that specifically govern the firearms trade. Indeed, in the vast majority of instances in which the predicate exception was discussed during the legislative debates, proponents spoke in broad, general terms, indicating that the bill would not immunize firearms companies that had engaged in\n   <em>\n    any\n   </em>\n   illegal activity.\n   <footnotemark>\n    82\n   </footnotemark>\n   Several cosponsors of the bill that became PLCAA specifically explained that it would not preclude victims of gun violence from holding firearms companies accountable for injuries resulting from their\n   gross negligence or reckless conduct, because, essentially, any such conduct would be in violation of some state or federal law. See, e.g., 151 Cong. Rec. 18,919 (2005), remarks of Senator Jon Llewellyn Kyl (\"[M]ost of the acts that would meet the definition of gross negligence would already be in violation of law. And if they are in violation of law, they are not exempted from this legislation. We don't try to exempt any gun manufacturer for conduct [that] is in violation of law. So by definition that would be an exemption from the provisions of the bill .... The bottom line here is that if there really is a problem, that is to say, the conduct is so bad that it is a violation of law, no lawsuit is precluded under our bill in any way.... So in fact if the gross negligence or reckless conduct of a person was the proximate cause of death or injury-that is the allegation-you are in court irrespective of this bill ....\"); id., 18,922, remarks of Senator Orrin Grant Hatch (\"[v]irtually any act that would meet the definition of gross negligence ... would already be a violation of [f]ederal, [s]tate or local law, and therefore would not receive the protection of this law anyway\"). The clear implication of these comments is that the\n   predicate exception extends beyond firearms specific laws and encompasses laws such as CUTPA, which prohibit wholly irresponsible conduct such as the wrongful advertising of potentially dangerous products for criminal or illegal purposes.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-235\">\n   The strongest support for the defendants' reading of the legislative history is a passing statement by the author of PLCAA, Senator Craig, that \"[t]his bill does not shield ... [those who] have violated existing law ... and I am referring to the [f]ederal firearms laws ....\" Id., 18,085. That statement was made, however, in the context of a discussion of the federal record keeping requirements that govern sales of firearms, requirements that are indisputably specific to that industry. At no point did Senator Craig suggest that, in his opinion, the only\n   <em>\n    state\n   </em>\n   laws that qualify as predicate statutes are those that specifically regulate the firearms industry. Rather, on numerous occasions during the legislative debates, Senator Craig categorically stated that the bill was intended to protect only law abiding firearms companies that had not violated\n   <em>\n    any\n   </em>\n   federal or state law.\n   <footnotemark>\n    83\n   </footnotemark>\n   \"As we have stressed repeatedly,\"\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-236\">\n   Senator\n   Craig emphasized, \"this legislation will not bar the courthouse doors to victims who have been harmed by the negligence or misdeeds of anyone in the gun industry. Well recognized causes of action are protected by the bill. Plaintiffs can still argue their cases for violations of law ....\"\n   <footnotemark>\n    84\n   </footnotemark>\n   Id., 18,096. Accordingly, we conclude that the legislative history of PLCAA does not support the defendants' contention that Congress intended to shield them from potential liability for the types of CUTPA violations that the plaintiffs have alleged.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-237\">\n   VI\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-238\">\n   CONCLUSION\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-239\">\n   It is, of course, possible that Congress intended to broadly immunize firearms sellers from liability for the sort of egregious misconduct that the plaintiffs have alleged but failed to effectively express that intent in the language of PLCAA or during the legislative hearings. If that is the case, and in light of the difficulties that\n   the federal courts have faced in attempting to distill a clear rule or guiding principle from the predicate exception, Congress may wish to revisit the issue and clarify its intentions.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-240\">\n   We are confident, however, that, if there were credible allegations that a firearms seller had run explicit advertisements depicting and glorifying school shootings, and promoted its products in video games, such as \"School Shooting,\" that glorify and reward such unlawful conduct,\n   <footnotemark>\n    85\n   </footnotemark>\n   and if a troubled young man who watched those advertisements and played those games were inspired thereby to commit a terrible crime like the ones involved in the Sandy Hook massacre, then even the most ardent sponsors of PLCAA would not have wanted to bar a consumer protection lawsuit seeking to hold the supplier accountable for the injuries wrought by such unscrupulous marketing practices. That is not this case, and yet the underlying legal principles are no different. Once we accept the premise that Congress did not intend to immunize firearms suppliers who engage in truly unethical and irresponsible marketing practices promoting criminal conduct, and given that statutes such as CUTPA are the only means available to address those types of wrongs, it falls to a jury to decide whether the promotional schemes alleged in the present case rise to the level of illegal trade practices and whether fault for the tragedy can be laid at their feet.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-241\">\n   For the foregoing reasons, we conclude that the trial court properly determined that, although most of the plaintiffs' claims should have been dismissed, PLCAA does not bar the plaintiffs' wrongful marketing claims and that, at least to the extent that it prohibits the unethical advertising of dangerous products for illegal\n   purposes, CUTPA qualifies as a predicate statute.

(\"[i]t is not disputed that [the criminal nuisance statute] is a statute of general applicability that has never been applied to firearms suppliers for conduct like that complained of by the [c]ity\"). The city argued that the predicate exception saved its action \"because [the criminal nuisance statute] is a statute 'applicable to the sale or marketing of [firearms].'

[3] that do not expressly regulate firearms but that clearly can be said to implicate the purchase and sale of\n   firearms.\" Id., at 404. In reaching that conclusion, the court stated that it found \"nothing in the [arms act]\n   that requires any express language regarding firearms to be included in a statute in order for that statute to fall within the predicate exception\" and declined \"to foreclose the possibility that, under certain circumstances, state courts may apply a statute of general applicability to the type of conduct that the [c]ity complains of, in which case such a statute might qualify as a predicate statute.\" Id., at 399-400. Accordingly, the court concluded that \"while the mere absence in [the criminal nuisance statute] of any express reference to firearms does not, in and of itself, preclude that statute's eligibility to serve as a predicate statute under the [arms act, the criminal nuisance statute] is a statute of general applicability that does not encompass the conduct of firearms manufacturers of which the [c]ity complains.

This ultimate conclusion is simply inconsistent with the court's more detailed analysis of the relevant statutory text and legislative history, which suggests a narrower reading of that exception. Specifically, the court considered the statements of purpose, as well as the list of example predicate statutes set forth in\n   <extracted-citation index=\"362\" url=\"https://cite.case.law/citations/?q=15%20U.S.C.%20%C2%A7%207903\">\n    15 U.S.C. \u00a7 7903\n   </extracted-citation>\n   (5) (A) (iii) (I) and (II), which are \"said to include statutes regulating [record keeping] and those prohibiting participation in direct illegal sales,\" and stated that \"construing the term 'applicable to' to mean statutes that clearly can be said to regulate the firearms industry more accurately reflects the intent of Congress.\"\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-267\">\n   <extracted-citation index=\"363\" url=\"https://cite.case.law/citations/?q=15%20U.S.C.%20%C2%A7%207903\">\n    Id., at 402\n   </extracted-citation>\n   .

In contending that the arms act does not reduce \"personal accountability\" for firearms manufacturers, given its exceptions, Senator Coburn emphasized that \"gun manufacturers and sellers are already policed enough, too much, through hundreds of pages of statutes, hundreds of pages of regulations. To name a few sources of regulations of guns and ammunition: the Internal Revenue Code, including the National Firearms Act postal regulations restricting shipping of handguns; [f]ederal explosive law; regulations for gunpowder and ammunition manufacture; the Arms Export Control Act; the Commerce Department export regulations; the Department of Transportation regulations on ammunition explosives and hazardous material transport. In addition to keeping explicit records that can be inspected by ... the Bureau of Alcohol, Tobacco, Firearms, and Explosives, licensed dealers have to conduct a [f]ederal criminal background check .... All retail gun buyers are screened to the best of the [g]overnment's ability.\" Id., 18,059-60; see also id., 19,119, remarks of Senator Sessions (emphasizing that arms act \"allows lawsuits for violation of contract, for negligence, in not following the rules and regulations and for violating any law or regulation that is part of the complex rules that control sellers\n   and manufacturers of firearms\"). Similarly, when introducing the final Senate bill in the House, Representative Phil Gingrey explained that the predicate exception \"would specifically allow lawsuits against firearms dealers such as the dealer whose firearm ended up in the hands of the [beltway] snipers who failed to maintain a required inventory list necessary to ensure that they are alerted to any firearm thefts.\" Id., 23,020.\n   Moreover, the majority does not cite, and my independent research has not revealed, any legislative history indicating that state unfair trade practice statutes were within the contemplation of Congress in enacting the predicate exception. Other statements indicate that such statutes were not contemplated as predicates, and that supporters of the arms act specifically rejected the viability of claims arising from the advertising of firearms. For example, arguing in support of the arms act, Senator Hatch criticized pending actions against gun manufacturers, observing that these \"lawsuits,\n   <em>\n    citing deceptive marketing or some other pretext\n   </em>\n   , continue to be filed in a number of [s]tates, and they continue to be unsound.\n   <em>\n    These lawsuits claim that sellers give the false impression that gun ownership enhances personal safety or that sellers should know that certain guns will be used illegally\n   </em>\n   . That is pure bunk. Let's look at the truth. The fact is that none of these lawsuits are aimed at the actual wrongdoer who kills or injures another with a gun-none. Instead, the lawsuits are focused on legitimate, law-abiding businesses.\"\n   <footnotemark>\n    18\n   </footnotemark>\n   (Emphasis added.) 151 Cong. Rec. 18,073; see also id. (noting that arms act \"provides carefully\n   tailored protections for legitimate lawsuits, such as those where there are knowing violations of gun sale laws\").\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-285\">\n   Finally, congressional concerns about vague standards leading to liability also support a reading of the predicate exception that is limited to firearms industry-specific statutes, rather than statutes of general applicability such as CUTPA. For example, in arguing in the House Judiciary Committee-seemingly inexplicably-\n   <em>\n    against\n   </em>\n   an amendment that would clarify that the arms act allows actions against gun dealers who knowingly sell firearms to a person who is on the violent gang and terrorist watch list maintained by the Department of Justice, Representative Christopher B. Cannon argued that \"the vast number of cosponsors of this bill would agree that the burden here should be on the [g]overnment to identify people and not create a vague standard that could be used again to destroy gun manufacturers with lawsuits that don't have clarity, but cost a great deal of money.\" H.R. Rep. No. 109-124, supra, p. 126. Likewise, arguing in\n   support of the arms act, Senator John Thune emphasized that the exceptions, including for violating the law in the production or sale of a firearm, \"are not arbitrary standards ....\" 151 Cong. Rec. 19,119 (2005).\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-286\">\n   Similarly, in opposing a bill amendment that would provide an exception to the arms act for \"gross negligence\" or \"reckless conduct,\" Senator John Cornyn argued that the breadth of those terms \"would actually gut the very underlying purpose of this legislation\" because the pleading of such claims would broaden the scope of the discovery involved, and allow for greater harassment of the manufacturers via the litigation process. Id., 18,918. Senator Jon Llewellyn Kyl described the amendment as \"a poison pill for the entire bill because, in effect ... if you allege gross negligence or recklessness, then the exemption the bill provides\n   evaporates. So you are a lawyer. All you do is allege gross negligence or recklessness and, bingo, you are back in court again. So it totally undercuts the purpose of this legislation.\"\n   <footnotemark>\n    19\n   </footnotemark>\n   Id., 18,919; see also id., 18,921, remarks of Senator Craig (arguing that gross negligence exception would render arms act \"relatively meaningless as to where we are in relation to the kind of junk or dilatory lawsuits that are currently being filed against gun manufacturers and gun dealers who not only produce a legal product to the market but sell it in the legal context\"). Senator Graham similarly emphasized how statutes affect a manufacturer's duty of care, stating that the arms act \"doesn't let a seller or a distributor off the hook for violating a statute or making a sale illegally because it says, if you violate the law that exists, then you have broken a duty. Duty can be established by relationships. It can [also] be established by a statute. So this bill does not allow someone to sell a gun without following the procedures that we have set out to sell a gun. It doesn't allow someone to make a gun that is unsafe. You are on the hook, and you can be held accountable based on a simple negligence theory or a\n   negligence per se theory if you violate a specific statute during the sale of a gun or manufacturing of a gun. But what this bill prevents, and I think rightfully so, is establishing a duty along this line: That you have a responsibility, even if you do a lawful transaction or make a safe gun, for an event that you can't control, which is the intentional misuse of a weapon in a criminal fashion by another person. That is the heart of this bill. It doesn't relieve you of duties that the law imposes upon you to safely manufacture and to carefully sell. But we are not going to extend it to a concept where you are responsible, after you have done everything right, for what\n   somebody else may do who bought your product and they did it wrong and it is their fault, not yours. So it does not matter whether you use a gross negligence standard, a simple negligence standard, you have blown by the concept of the bill in my opinion. The debate should be, is there a duty owed in this country for people who follow the law, manufacture safely, sell within the confines of the laws we have written at the [s]tate and [f]ederal level to the public at large if an injury results from the criminal act of another? If that ever happens, this country has made a major change in the way we relate to each other and a major change in the law.\" Id., 18,920. Accordingly, I conclude that the legislative history demonstrates that Congress contemplated that only those statutes providing clear standards with respect to the sale and marketing of firearms would serve as predicate statutes.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-287\">\n   V\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-288\">\n   CONCLUSION\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-289\">\n   On the basis of my review of the text, case law, canons of construction, and legislative history, I conclude that predicate statutes under the predicate exception to the arms act,\n   <extracted-citation index=\"436\" url=\"https://cite.case.law/citations/?q=15%20U.S.C.%20%C2%A7%207903\">\n    15 U.S.C. \u00a7 7903\n   </extracted-citation>\n   (5) (A) (iii), are limited to\n   those specific to the sale and manufacture of firearms.\n   <footnotemark>\n    20\n   </footnotemark>\n   Compare\n   <em>\n    Phillips\n   </em>\n   v.\n   <em>\n    Lucky Gunner, LLC\n   </em>\n   ,\n   <extracted-citation case-ids=\"4291950\" index=\"437\" url=\"https://cite.case.law/f-supp-3d/84/1216/#p1226\">\n    84 F.Supp.3d 1216\n   </extracted-citation>\n   , 1219-20, 1224 (D.

See, e.g.,\n    <em>\n     United States\n    </em>\n    v.\n    <em>\n     Dauray\n    </em>\n    , supra,\n    <extracted-citation case-ids=\"11210088\" index=\"703\" url=\"https://cite.case.law/f3d/215/257/#p262\">\n     215 F.3d at 264\n    </extracted-citation>\n    (\"our role as a court is to apply the provision as written, not as we would write it\" [internal quotation marks omitted] ).\n   </p>\n  </footnote>\n  <footnote label=\"15\">\n   <p id=\"p-442\">\n    As a general matter, I also agree with the observation of Judge Marsha S.

Judge Berzon aptly observed that \"individual legislators at times suggested divergent views of what sorts of lawsuits the [arms act] would affect if it were passed into law. Some of those views appear perhaps implausibly narrow or implausibly broad, likely because the bill excited strong emotions from both its supporters and its opponents.

See, e.g., 151 Cong. Rec. 18,065 (2005), remarks of Senator Dianne Feinstein (\"[The arms act] has nothing to do with protecting lawful commerce; rather, it protects one segment of industry against the lawful interests of our [s]tates in remedying and deterring negligent conduct.... Its proponents argue that lawsuits need to be stopped in order to defend their view of the [s]econd [a]mendment. But that is pretense. This bill is a simple giveaway to one industry-the gun lobby. It is a special interest windfall.\"); id., 18,902, remarks of Senator Edward Moore Kennedy (\"Instead of addressing the real issues that can make our country and our communities safer, we are considering a bill that will close the courthouse door to victims of gun crimes and give a free pass to the handful of gun dealers and gun manufacturers who sell firearms to terrorists and criminals.

McGovern (\"While the proponents of this bill claim that the intent of this legislation is to protect jobs at mom-and-pop gun stores from reckless lawsuits, the truth is that the bill is all about protecting profits for the gun industry. Ensuring its yearly profits, not protecting jobs nor safeguarding gun sales, is atop the priorities of the gun industry.\"); id., 19,217, remarks of Senator Charles Ellis Schumer (\"[I]t is shocking that we would spend our time giving unwarranted and unprecedented immunity to an industry whose products, when allowed into the hands of the wrong people, do incredible harm to innocent Americans. We even put off working on a defense bill to do this favor to the gun lobby.\").\n   </p>\n  </footnote>\n  <footnote label=\"17\">\n   <p id=\"p-444\">\n    I disagree with the majority's circular reliance on statements of legislators indicating that the arms act protects \" 'law-abiding' \" gun dealers and manufacturers, as suggesting that encompasses those who do not engage in violations of unfair trade practices acts. See, e.g., 151 Cong. Rec. 18,057 (2005), remarks of Senator Craig (observing that actions against firearms industry \"all seek the same goal of forcing law-abiding businesses selling a legal product to pay for damages from the criminal misuse of that product\"); id., 19,137, remarks of Senator Craig (\"[w]hat we have crafted is a very narrow exemption from predatory lawsuits seeking to hold legitimate, law-abiding people responsible for the harm done by the misdeeds of people over whom they have no control\"); id., 23,024, remarks of Representative Charles Foster Bass (arguing that arms act \"protects licensed and law abiding firearms and ammunitions manufacturers and sellers from lawsuits that seek to hold them responsible for the crimes that third party criminals commit\"). These statements, which are ambiguous and no more illuminating than the purpose of eliminating \"frivolous\" lawsuits, prove too much, as the arms act by its very terms shields gun manufacturers and dealers from the consequences of violating numerous laws, both common and statutory in nature, such as California's general tort statutes.

Accordingly, this court's decision in\n    <em>\n     Ganim\n    </em>\n    about the plaintiffs' standing in that case has absolutely no precedential value with respect to the viability of a CUTPA claim founded on the \"immoral advertising\" of firearms.\n   </p>\n   <p id=\"p-455\">\n    The Superior Court's decision in\n    <em>\n     Salomonson\n    </em>\n    is even more inapposite than\n    <em>\n     Ganim\n    </em>\n    .\n    <em>\n     Salomonson\n    </em>\n    , which is a report of an attorney trial referee rather than a decision of a judge of the Superior Court, does not involve crime or victims of crime, but instead is a routine business dispute, in which the court held that a gun fabricator violated CUTPA by failing to perform under a contract to convert three semi-automatic rifles to fully automatic weapons, including by obtaining necessary federal regulatory approvals.

Once we accept the premise that Congress did not intend to immunize firearms suppliers who engage in truly unethical and irresponsible marketing practices promoting criminal conduct, and given that statutes such as CUTPA are the only means available to address those types of wrongs, it falls to a jury to decide whether the promotional schemes alleged in the present case rise to the level of illegal trade practices and whether fault for the tragedy can be laid at their feet.\" I do not share the majority's apparent optimism about the 109th Congress, which passed the arms act; specifically, until those who ply their judicial craft at One First Street tell me differently, I do not believe that they would have been inclined to allow the use of a broadly drafted statute like CUTPA to hold a firearm manufacturer or seller involved in such a hypothetical liable for anything more than thoughts and prayers.
