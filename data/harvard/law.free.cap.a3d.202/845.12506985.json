For the following reasons, we affirm.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-10\">\n   <strong>\n    Background\n   </strong>\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-11\">\n   The facts are undisputed. In July 2006, Isle of Capri Associates, L.P. (IOC) created a condominium complex, known as the Waterfront Square Condominium (Master Condominium), by recording a declaration of condominium (Master Declaration) under the Pennsylvania Uniform Condominium Act (Condominium Act).\n   <footnotemark>\n    2\n   </footnotemark>\n   The Master Declaration provided for the development of five undeveloped pad sites,\n   <em>\n    i.e\n   </em>\n   ., Pad Units 1 to 5. Phase I called for IOC's construction of two condominium towers, called the Peninsula and the Regatta, and a parking garage on Pad Units 1 and 2. The Master Declaration provided that the parking garage was a common element of the Master Condominium and that IOC, as declarant, or \"the declarant of such residential condominiums, if not [IOC],\" may grant parking licenses to the purchasers of the condominium units. Reproduced Record at 33a (R.R. ----). Phase II called for the construction of a tower, called the Reef, on Pad Unit 3 by IOC-Reef. In April 2009, IOC-Reef recorded a declaration under the Condominium Act for the Reef Condominium (Reef Declaration). IOC planned to construct additional towers on Pad Units 4 and 5, to be known, respectively, as the Horizon and the Tides; these two pad sites were never developed.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-12\">\n   In May 2007, IOC borrowed $39,265,840 from Union Labor Life Insurance Company (Lender) to finance construction of the condominium complex. The mortgage agreement (IOC Mortgage Agreement) identifies \"mortgaged property\" as follows:\n  </p>\n  <blockquote id=\"p-13\">\n   2.1.1 All that certain Pad Unit 3 (as defined in the [Master Declaration] ) in the Master Condominium\n   <em>\n    and the undivided twenty percent (20%) ownership interest in the Common Elements appurtenant to Pad Unit 3\n   </em>\n   under the terms of the [Master Declaration], all as more particularly described in Exhibit \"A\" attached hereto and made a part hereof,\n   <sup>\n    [\n   </sup>\n   <footnotemark>\n    3\n   </footnotemark>\n   <sup>\n    ]\n   </sup>\n   upon which Mortgagor intends\n   to construct a residential condominium project to be known as the Reef Condominium and Spa at Waterfront Square (hereinafter collectively referred to as the \"Reef Pad Unit\");\n  </blockquote>\n  <blockquote id=\"p-14\">\n   2.1.2 All that certain Pad Unit 4 (as defined in the [Master Declaration] ) in the Master Condominium\n   <em>\n    and the undivided twenty percent (20%) ownership interest in the Common Elements appurtenant to Pad Unit 4\n   </em>\n   under the terms of the [Master Declaration], all as more particularly described in Exhibit \"A\" attached hereto and made a part hereof, upon which Mortgagor intends to construct a residential condominium project to be known as the Horizon Condominium and Spa at Waterfront Square (hereinafter collectively referred to as the \"Horizon Pad Unit\");\n  </blockquote>\n  <blockquote id=\"p-15\">\n   2.1.3 All that certain Pad Unit 5 (as defined in the [Master Declaration] ) in the Master Condominium\n   <em>\n    and the undivided twenty percent (20%) ownership interest in the Common Elements appurtenant to Pad Unit 5\n   </em>\n   under the terms of the [Master Declaration], all as more particularly described in Exhibit \"A\" attached hereto and made a part hereof, upon which Mortgagor intends to construct a residential condominium project to be known as the Tide Condominium and Spa at Waterfront Square (hereinafter collectively referred to as the \"Tide Pad Unit\");\n  </blockquote>\n  <blockquote id=\"p-16\">\n   2.1.4 The Peninsula Units,\n   <em>\n    together with the undivided ownership in the Common Elements appurtenant to such Peninsula Units\n   </em>\n   , all as more particularly described in Exhibit \"A\" attached hereto and made a part hereof;\n  </blockquote>\n  <blockquote id=\"p-17\">\n   2.1.5 The Regatta Units,\n   <em>\n    together with the undivided ownership in the Common Elements appurtenant to such Regatta Units\n   </em>\n   , all as more particularly described in Exhibit \"A\" attached hereto and made a part hereof;\n  </blockquote>\n  <blockquote id=\"p-18\">\n   2.1.6 [A]ll structures, improvements, buildings and any additions and alterations thereto or replacements thereof, now or hereafter erected upon the Reef Pad Unit, the Horizon Pad Unit and the Tide Pad Unit (hereinafter collectively referred to as the \"Master Condominium Units\"),\n   <em>\n    including but not limited to parking facilities and other infrastructure\n   </em>\n   , or constructed within the Peninsula Units or the Regatta Units (all of the foregoing being collectively referred to as the \"Improvements\") ...\n  </blockquote>\n  <blockquote id=\"p-19\">\n   * * *\n  </blockquote>\n  <blockquote id=\"p-20\">\n   2.1.12\n   <em>\n    All of Mortgagor's right, title and interest in and to\n   </em>\n   all trade leases, subleases, lettings,\n   <em>\n    licenses\n   </em>\n   and other occupancy agreements, and guarantee\n   thereof, for the Premises or any part thereof ...\n  </blockquote>\n  <blockquote id=\"p-21\">\n   * * *\n  </blockquote>\n  <blockquote id=\"p-22\">\n   2.1.15\n   <em>\n    All licenses\n   </em>\n   , permits, and warranties attributable or\n   <em>\n    allocable to all or any portion of the Premises\n   </em>\n   , both real and personal;\n  </blockquote>\n  <blockquote id=\"p-23\">\n   * * *\n  </blockquote>\n  <blockquote id=\"p-24\">\n   2.1.19\n   <em>\n    All of Mortgagor's right, title and interest in and to the [Master Declaration]\n   </em>\n   , the Peninsula Condominium Declaration, the Regatta Condominium Declaration and any Declaration of Condominium hereafter recorded in connection with the Reef Pad Unit, the Horizon Pad Unit and/or the Tide Pad Unit ... or any interest therein or rights thereunder, now owned or hereafter acquired.\n  </blockquote>\n  <p id=\"p-25\">\n   IOC Mortgage Agreement at 4-7; R.R. 429a-432a (emphasis added).\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-26\">\n   To finance Phase II of the construction, in November 2007, IOC-Reef borrowed $97,300,000 from Lender, secured by IOC-Reef's interest in the condominium complex. This included Pad Unit 3; the Reef Condominium units; the associated common elements; and IOC-Reef's \"right, title and interest in and to the Master [ ] Declaration and all other Condominium Documents.\" IOC-Reef Mortgage Agreement at 6; R.R. 495a.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-27\">\n   IOC and IOC-Reef defaulted on the loans. On September 26, 2011, Lender commenced two foreclosure actions in the Philadelphia County Court of Common Pleas. Against IOC, it sought $25,337,351.88, plus costs, taxes and interest; against IOC-Reef it sought $79,020,015.54, plus costs, taxes and interest.\n   <footnotemark>\n    4\n   </footnotemark>\n   That same day, Lender petitioned for the appointment of a receiver over the mortgaged property.

Receivership Order, 12/20/2011, at 1, \u00b6 2; R.R. 224a, 235a.

The court also entered a consent judgment against IOC-Reef in the amount of $79,020,015.54, plus costs, taxes and interest. Subsequently, in March 2012, writs of execution were filed, and a sheriff's sale was scheduled for June 5, 2012.

Gior is the owner of a commercial unit in the Reef Condominium.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-40\">\n   On June 5, 2012, at the sheriff's sale, Waterfront purchased Regatta Condominium Unit R 2801, the undeveloped Pad Units 4 and 5, and over 100 units in the\n   Reef Condominium. In both foreclosure actions, Lender assigned its claims to Waterfront. After the sheriff's sale, IOC-Reef sold 88 parking licenses to Gior.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-41\">\n   In October 2013, Gior and IOC-Reef initiated an action against Waterfront, the Association, and Receiver in the Commerce Court, a division of the Philadelphia County Court of Common Pleas,\n   <footnotemark>\n    7\n   </footnotemark>\n   to validate Gior's ownership of the parking licenses it purchased from IOC and IOC-Reef. Waterfront, the Association, and Receiver filed a motion for summary judgment asserting that IOC and IOC-Reef lacked the power to transfer the parking licenses and that their attempt to do so violated the receivership order. In its counterclaim, Waterfront asserted that it owned all of the parking places transferred to Gior by IOC and IOC-Reef.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-42\">\n   <strong>\n    Commerce Court Decision\n   </strong>\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-43\">\n   By order of August 31, 2015, the Commerce Court granted the motion for summary judgment with respect to the 88 parking licenses that IOC-Reef sold after the sheriff's sale. The Commerce Court reasoned that the right of IOC and IOC-Reef to issue parking licenses \"was a special declarant right that terminated at the foreclosure sale and fell within the definition of Mortgaged Property.\" Commerce Court Order, 8/31/2015, at 1-2 n.1; R.R. 4121a-4122a. The Commerce Court denied summary judgment with regard to the 91 licenses that IOC transferred to Gior prior to the foreclosure sale, concluding that there were unresolved factual issues. The Commerce Court concluded that \"the receivership court\" was the proper tribunal to address the factual issues surrounding the 91 parking licenses.\n   <em>\n    Id.\n   </em>\n   at 2 n.1; R.R. 4122a. Lender, Waterfront and Receiver then filed a motion in the receivership proceeding (Receivership Court) to void the transfer of the 91 parking licenses.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-44\">\n   <strong>\n    Receivership Court Decision\n   </strong>\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-45\">\n   On April 18, 2016, the Receivership Court granted the motion to void the transfer of the 91 parking licenses as violative of the receivership order. In support, the Receivership Court relied upon the IOC Mortgage Agreement, which stated that the mortgaged property includes (1) the physical structure of the parking garage; (2) the undivided interests in the parking garage as a common element; (3) parking licenses; (4) any right, title or interest in any parking license; and (5) the specific right to grant a parking license as permitted by the Master Declaration. Receivership Court op. at 853-54. As such, the Receivership Court held that IOC could not transfer the 91 parking licenses without court approval in the receivership proceeding. On May 16, 2016, IOC and its affiliates appealed the Receivership Court's decision regarding the transfer of the 91 parking licenses.\n   <footnotemark>\n    8\n   </footnotemark>\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-46\">\n   Following the April 18, 2016, Receivership Court order, the parties stipulated that the remaining claims before the Commerce Court should be dismissed so that the Commerce Court's grant of summary judgment with respect to the 88 parking licenses could be appealed. On July 20, 2016, the Commerce Court signed the stipulation\n   and order,\n   <footnotemark>\n    9\n   </footnotemark>\n   and Gior and IOC-Reef appealed.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-47\">\n   <strong>\n    Commerce Court 1925(a) Opinion\n   </strong>\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-48\">\n   In support of its August 31, 2015, order, the Commerce Court filed an opinion pursuant to Rule 1925(a) of the Pennsylvania Rules of Appellate Procedure, PA. R.A.P. 1925(a). The court explained that under the Superior Court's decision in\n   <em>\n    MetroClub Condominium Association v. 201-59 North Eighth Street Associates, L.P\n   </em>\n   .,\n   <extracted-citation case-ids=\"7312450\" index=\"0\" url=\"https://cite.case.law/a3d/47/137/\">\n    47 A.3d 137\n   </extracted-citation>\n   (Pa. Super. 2012) (\n   <em>\n    MetroClub\n   </em>\n   ), IOC and IOC-Reef's right to issue parking licenses was a special declarant right that terminated at the foreclosure sale. It further noted that a Uniform Law Comment states that the list of special declarant rights set forth in Section 3103 of the Condominium Act is not exclusive. Commerce Court 1925(a) opinion at 16-18 (quoting 68 Pa. C.S. \u00a7 3103, Uniform Law Comment 13).\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-49\">\n   The Commerce Court explained that the parking licenses were mortgaged property subject to the receivership order.

The Master Declaration further provided that IOC, as declarant, or \"the declarant of such residential condominiums, if not [IOC],\" may grant parking licenses to the purchasers of the condominium units. R.R. 33a. Simply, the sheriff's sale on June 5, 2012, divested IOC and IOC-Reef of all their interest in the mortgaged property, including the parking garage and the right to issue licenses to the garage.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-50\">\n   <strong>\n    Appeal\n   </strong>\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-51\">\n   On appeal,\n   <footnotemark>\n    10\n   </footnotemark>\n   Gior and IOC-Reef raise two issues for our consideration. First, they argue that the Commerce Court erred in determining that IOC and IOC-Reef's interest in issuing parking licenses was a special declarant right under the Condominium Act. Second, they argue that the Commerce Court erred in holding that the parking licenses and the right to issue such licenses were mortgaged property subject to the receivership in the foreclosure action.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-52\">\n   <strong>\n    I.

IOC and IOC-Reef's interest in issuing parking licenses is a special declarant right under Section 3103 of the Condominium Act.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-70\">\n   Nevertheless, Gior and IOC-Reef argue that the Master Declaration gave IOC and IOC-Reef an ownership interest in \"intangible personal property,\" which must be distinguished from \"special declarant rights\" in Section 3103 of the Condominium Act.

The successor declarant argued that it was not obligated to pay these charges because \"it only acquired a successor declarant status, not the ownership of the twelve townhouse units.\"\n   <em>\n    <extracted-citation case-ids=\"11636392\" index=\"4\" url=\"https://cite.case.law/a2d/724/389/\">\n     Id.\n    </extracted-citation>\n   </em>\n   <extracted-citation case-ids=\"11636392\" index=\"4\" url=\"https://cite.case.law/a2d/724/389/\">\n    at 392\n   </extracted-citation>\n   . The declaration made each parking space in the garage a limited common element when it was assigned to a townhouse unit. In holding that the successor declarant was obligated to pay for the maintenance of the parking spaces, this Court explained as follows:\n  </p>\n  <blockquote id=\"p-72\">\n   Section 3304(c) of the [Condominium] Act, 68 Pa. C.S. \u00a7 3304(c), provides that in case of sale by a bankruptcy trustee, a person acquiring title to the units succeeds to \"all special declarant rights\" upon request. Our review of the June 4, 1991 Agreement of Sale and the February 10, 1992 Assignment indicates that\n   <em>\n    the bankruptcy trustee assigned the special declarant rights reserved by [the original declarant] in the [d]eclaration to [the successor declarant]\n   </em>\n   . However,\n   <em>\n    [the successor declarant] totally disregards the fact that it acquired not only the special declarant rights but also the title to the twelve townhouse units and the exclusive right to use the parking spaces\n   </em>\n   designated for those units by accepting the 1992 deed. Even assuming\n   <em>\n    arguendo\n   </em>\n   that the twelve parking spaces have never been allocated to either the [a]ssociation or [the successor declarant], as [the successor declarant] asserts, [the successor declarant] would be still liable for the parking space expenses as a successor declarant under ... the [d]eclaration.\n  </blockquote>\n  <p id=\"p-73\">\n   <em>\n    <extracted-citation case-ids=\"11636392\" index=\"5\" url=\"https://cite.case.law/a2d/724/389/\">\n     Id.\n    </extracted-citation>\n   </em>\n   <extracted-citation case-ids=\"11636392\" index=\"5\" url=\"https://cite.case.law/a2d/724/389/\">\n    at 394\n   </extracted-citation>\n   (emphasis added).\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-74\">\n   Gior and IOC-Reef argue that by virtue of the above-quoted passage, this Court has \"recognized that the ownership rights to the parking spaces - which, according to the [Master] Declaration here took the form of the right to issue Parking Licenses - were separate and apart from the 'special declarant rights' identified in [the Condominium Act].\" Gior Brief at 39. Stated otherwise, they contend that the Master Declaration gave IOC and IOC-Reef ownership of the right to issue parking spaces, which they describe as a form of intangible personal personalty. We disagree.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-75\">\n   <em>\n    Mayflower\n   </em>\n   is limited to its facts; the issue decided in that case was whether the successor declarant was liable for the maintenance of a parking garage that had been built in advance of the townhouse units assigned to that garage. The successor declarant owned those yet-to-be constructed townhouse units and the parking spaces appurtenant thereto. We held, accordingly, that the successor declarant was liable for the maintenance of the garage because of its status both as declarant and as owner of the 12 townhouse units for which the parking spaces had been designated.\n   <em>\n    Mayflower\n   </em>\n   did not establish, as Gior and IOC-Reef argue, that the right to issue parking licenses is personal property that can be separated from the real property that makes up the condominium and its common elements.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-76\">\n   Further, this argument of Gior and IOC-Reef ignores the language of the Master Declaration, which provides in pertinent part:\n  </p>\n  <blockquote id=\"p-77\">\n   (b) If residential condominiums are constructed on the Pad Units, [IOC] (or the declarant of such residential condominiums, if not [IOC] ) may grant Parking Licenses to the purchasers of Residential Units and Commercial Units in the condominiums developed on the Pad Units.\n   <em>\n    When each buyer of a Residential Unit or Commercial Unit in a Building is conveyed title to its Unit, that buyer may receive a non-exclusive license to park one car in the Parking Garage (a \"Parking License\") for no additional consideration. The Declarant reserves the right to grant to buyers of Units Parking Licenses for no consideration, and reserves the right to grant to the buyers of certain Units one or more additional Parking Licenses for additional consideration\n   </em>\n   ....\n  </blockquote>\n  <blockquote id=\"p-78\">\n   (c)\n   <em>\n    The holders of Parking Licenses must be owners or tenants of Units\n   </em>\n   ....\n  </blockquote>\n  <p id=\"p-79\">\n   Master Declaration, Section 4.4(b); R.R. 33a (emphasis added). This language establishes that the ownership of the parking spaces belongs to condominium unit owners. The parking garage is a common element specified under Section 4.4(a) of the Master Declaration, which is \"intended to be used in common by all residents of the Pad Units.\" R.R. 29a, 33a. As declarants, IOC and IOC-Reef had the right to issue parking licenses to condominium unit purchasers who needed to access the parking garage. The right to issue parking licenses derived from the Master Declaration and is a special declarant right; it is not an intangible personal property interest.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-80\">\n   In dismissing Gior's claim as to the 88 parking licenses transferred from IOC-Reef after the sheriff's sale, the Commerce Court held that IOC-Reef's special declarant rights, including its right to issue parking licenses, terminated at the foreclosure sale. We agree. Section 3304(d) of the Condominium Act states in pertinent part:\n  </p>\n  <blockquote id=\"p-81\">\n   Upon foreclosure, tax sale, judicial sale, sale by a trustee under a deed of trust or sale under 11 U.S.C. (relating to bankruptcy) or receivership or similar proceedings of all units and other real estate in a condominium owned by a declarant: (1) the declarant ceases to have any special declarant rights....\n  </blockquote>\n  <p id=\"p-82\">\n   68 Pa. C.S. \u00a7 3304(d). The sheriff's sale, which occurred in June of 2012, terminated all of IOC-Reef's special declarant rights, including the right to transfer 88 parking licenses to Gior.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-83\">\n   <strong>\n    II. Mortgaged Property\n   </strong>\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-84\">\n   Gior and IOC-Reef argue, next, that Gior's ownership of the parking licenses and IOC-Reef's right to issue those parking licenses were not mortgaged property because they were not included in either of the Mortgage Agreements. Section 2.1.15 of the IOC Mortgage Agreement\n   and Section 2.1.12 of the IOC-Reef Mortgage Agreement stated that licenses \"attributable or allocable to all or any portion of the Premises\" are mortgaged property, but licenses that are acquired or created in the future are not included. R.R. 431a, 495a. Further, the right to issue parking licenses falls within the scope of \"permitted exceptions\" to the definition of \"mortgaged property,\" as provided under Section 2.1 in both Mortgage Agreements. R.R. 432a, 495a. Gior and IOC-Reef argue that in construing the Mortgage Agreements, the Commerce Court failed to consider the parties' course of conduct over four years, during which the parties never treated parking license rights as mortgaged property. They further argue that the Commerce Court failed to construe ambiguities in favor of Gior and IOC-Reef, which did not draft the Mortgage Agreements.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-85\">\n   The documentary evidence supports the Commerce Court's conclusion that the parking licenses and the right to issue such licenses were mortgaged property. Both Mortgage Agreements encumbered pad units, condominium units, and the associated common elements which, according to the Master Declaration, include the parking garage. The mortgaged property also includes IOC and IOC-Reef's \"right, title and interest in and to all trade leases, subleases, lettings, licenses and other occupancy agreements\" as well as their \"right, title and interest in and to the [Master Declaration].\" R.R. 431a-432a, 494a-495a. One right so encumbered was the declarant's right to issue parking licenses to condominium unit owners for consideration. In short, the relevant documents fully support the Commerce Court's holding that the parking garage, the licenses to the parking garage, and IOC and IOC-Reef's right to issue those licenses constituted mortgaged property. The foreclosure divested IOC and IOC-Reef of any interest in the parking garage, including the right to issue parking licenses.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-86\">\n   A receiver is considered an officer and agent of the court that appoints the receiver, and it is a \"usual and ordinary duty of a receiver\" to sell property on the court's order.\n   <em>\n    Lewistown Trust Company v. Nestler\n   </em>\n   ,\n   <extracted-citation case-ids=\"1150706\" index=\"6\" url=\"https://cite.case.law/pa/312/484/\">\n    312 Pa. 484\n   </extracted-citation>\n   ,\n   <extracted-citation index=\"7\" url=\"https://cite.case.law/citations/?q=167%20A.%20354\">\n    167 A. 354\n   </extracted-citation>\n   , 355 (1933) (\"A receiver is an executive officer of the court which appoints him, and his acts with regard to the property in his custody, when authorized, are the acts of the court in whose hands, in contemplation of law, the property actually is.\"). Here, the receivership order provided that Receiver \"shall, as of the date of this Order, enter upon, receive and take complete possession\" of all of the mortgaged property, \"including without limitation, ... all of [IOC and IOC-Reef's] interest in the Condominium Associations.\" Consent Order \u00b6 3; R.R. 225a, 236a. The receivership order also required IOC and IOC-Reef to \"forthwith surrender possession of the Mortgaged Property\" and enjoined IOC and IOC-Reef from \"interfering in any way with the management of the Mortgaged Property.\" Consent Order \u00b6\u00b6 12, 13; R.R. 228a-229a, 239a. These requirements were violated when IOC transferred the 91 parking licenses to Gior before the foreclosure sale without seeking the Receivership Court's approval.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-87\">\n   Alternatively, Gior and IOC-Reef argue that the right to issue parking licenses falls within the scope of \"permitted exceptions\" to the definition of \"mortgaged property,\" as provided under Section 2.1 in both Mortgage Agreements. R.R. 432a. Section 2.1 states in pertinent part:\n  </p>\n  <blockquote id=\"p-88\">\n   TO HAVE AND TO HOLD the Mortgaged Property unto Mortgagee and its substitutes or successors forever, and Mortgagor does hereby bind itself, its successors, assigns, executors and administrators\n   to warrant and forever defend all and singular the Mortgaged Property unto Mortgagee, its successors and assigns, against every person whomsoever lawfully claiming or to claim an interest in the same, or any part thereof.\n   <em>\n    Subject only to (i) the specific matters, if any, set forth in Exhibit B attached hereto and hereby made a part hereof and any future matters approved in writing by Mortgagee as Permitted Exceptions (collectively, \"Permitted Exceptions\")\n   </em>\n   , and (ii) any other future matters expressly permitted hereunder.\n  </blockquote>\n  <p id=\"p-89\">\n   R.R. 432a, 495a (emphasis added). Exhibit B of the Mortgage Agreements, in turn, provides that \"[t]erms, conditions, restrictions, and obligations\" created by the Master Declaration is a \"permitted exception.\" R.R. 482a, 540a.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-90\">\n   Gior and IOC-Reef contend that one of the \"terms, conditions, and obligations\" under the Master Declaration relates to the issuance of the parking licenses. Gior Brief at 44. This argument lacks merit. The Master Declaration did not obligate IOC and IOC-Reef to issue parking licenses; rather, it states that they \"\n   <em>\n    may\n   </em>\n   grant Parking Licenses to the purchasers of Residential Units and Commercial Units.\" R.R. 33a (emphasis added). In short, the \"permitted exceptions\" language quoted above relates to the mortgagor's obligation to defend on behalf of the mortgagee against any claim relating to the mortgaged property. It does not provide an exception to the definition of \"mortgaged property.\"\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-91\">\n   Gior and IOC-Reef argue that the Commerce Court erred by ignoring the parties' course of conduct over four years, during which time the parties never treated parking licenses as mortgaged property. They also assert that the Commerce Court should have construed ambiguities in the definition of \"mortgaged property\" in favor of Gior and IOC-Reef, and it did not.
