Parrillo, Administratrix of the Estate of Daniel Santos (Parrillo or plaintiff), appeals from the entry of summary judgment in favor of the defendant, Shea Gregg, M.D. A justice of the Superior Court dismissed the action against Dr. Gregg because the statutory period for filing a wrongful death action had expired. After thoroughly reviewing the record and after carefully considering the arguments of the parties, we affirm the entry of summary judgment.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-10\">\n   <strong>\n    I\n   </strong>\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-11\">\n   <strong>\n    Facts and Travel\n   </strong>\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-12\">\n   In the early hours of Friday, February 17, 2012, Daniel Santos was returning home from an event celebrating his boss's birthday when he lost control of his vehicle and collided with a utility pole. Mr. Santos was transported to Rhode Island Hospital, where he was admitted to the Trauma Intensive Care Unit with multiple injuries, including six fractured ribs and other injuries to his right knee and right foot. Over the next three days, Santos's condition stabilized, and he even showed some signs of improvement. That improvement caused the medical staff to move Mr. Santos to the medical floor for further monitoring and treatment. There, he expressed his eagerness to go home.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-13\">\n   Optimism proved to be fleeting, however, and Mr. Santos's condition soon took a drastic turn for the worse. On February 21, Mr. Santos developed chest pain, and x-rays revealed that excess fluid had accumulated around his left lung. Mr. Santos was quickly transferred back to the Trauma Intensive Care Unit, where a chest tube was inserted and antibiotics were administered. That evening Mr. Santos suffered two cardiac arrests, but he regained vital signs after two minutes of cardiopulmonary resuscitation (CPR). He was then sedated in an effort to improve oxygenation and ventilation. Unfortunately, however, Mr. Santos's condition continued to deteriorate. On the morning of February 22, his family made the difficult decision to withdraw treatment. Mr. Santos was pronounced dead later that morning.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-14\">\n   On May 17, 2012, Dawn Parrillo, Mr. Santos's domestic partner and the administratrix of his estate, requested his medical records from Rhode Island Hospital because she believed that the records might reveal evidence of negligent treatment.\n   <footnotemark>\n    1\n   </footnotemark>\n   The hospital delivered those records three months later, on August 23, 2012.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-15\">\n   On January 9, 2014, nearly two years after Mr. Santos died and nearly a year and a half after she received his medical records, Parrillo filed a complaint against the hospital, as well as Charles Adams, M.D. and Whitney Young, M.D., two physicians who had been involved in Mr. Santos's care, alleging negligent treatment leading to the wrongful death of Mr. Santos.\n   <footnotemark>\n    2\n   </footnotemark>\n   Parrillo filed a first amended complaint on February 20, 2014, which was nearly identical to the original complaint, except that it omitted the allegations against Dr. Young.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-16\">\n   In February 2015, three years after Mr. Santos's death, Parrillo first propounded requests for production of documents and interrogatories upon both Rhode Island Hospital and Dr. Adams. Relevant to this appeal, the interrogatories to Rhode Island Hospital requested that the hospital provide the name, address, and a description of \"each and every person known to you to have treated the Plaintiff [\n   <em>\n    sic\n   </em>\n   ] while inpatient at the Rhode Island Hospital from the time of his admission through to the time of his death on February 22, 2012.\" The hospital responded with a boilerplate objection that the interrogatory sought privileged information and that it was \"ambiguous, overly broad and unduly burdensome.\" Nevertheless, the hospital stated further that \"[w]ithout waiving this objection, Plaintiff is referred to the medical records[.]\"\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-17\">\n   In November 2015, Parrillo propounded additional interrogatories upon Rhode Island Hospital, asking the hospital to \"identify by name(s), address(es) and date(s) of care and treatment of all physicians, including the attending physicians responsible for the medical treatment and care rendered to Mr. Santos from the date of his admission to the Rhode Island Hospital on February 17, 2012, through February 22, 2012.\" The hospital also objected to this interrogatory, again claiming that it was \"overly broad, irrelevant and burdensome[,]\" but again, without waiving that objection, referred Parrillo to Mr. Santos's \"Rhode Island Hospital chart.\" Parrillo did not file a motion to compel more responsive answers.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-18\">\n   Nevertheless, Rhode Island Hospital agreed to provide the names of the attending physicians during Mr. Santos's hospital stay, and, on February 3, 2016, the hospital sent Parrillo's attorney an email identifying, for the first time, Dr. Gregg as the attending physician in the Trauma Intensive Care Unit on February 20, 2012.\n   <footnotemark>\n    3\n   </footnotemark>\n   Armed with this information, on April 1, 2016, Parrillo moved for leave to amend her complaint a second time. That motion was granted on May 9, 2016. The second\n   amended complaint added several new defendants, including Dr. Gregg.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-19\">\n   Dr. Gregg filed a motion for summary judgment on May 23, 2016, claiming that the statute of limitations for wrongful death had expired before he had been added as a defendant. The Superior Court agreed, the motion was granted, and judgment was entered soon thereafter in favor of Dr. Gregg. Parrillo timely appealed.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-20\">\n   <strong>\n    II\n   </strong>\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-21\">\n   <strong>\n    Standard of Review\n   </strong>\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-22\">\n   This Court reviews a decision granting summary judgment\n   <em>\n    de novo\n   </em>\n   .\n   <em>\n    DeLong v.

We answer that it is not.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-26\">\n   In Rhode Island, actions seeking recovery for a wrongful death must be commenced within three years of the date of death, except in situations where the wrongful death is alleged to have been \"caused by any wrongful act, neglect or default which is not known at the time of death[.]\" Section 10-7-2. In those circumstances, the statute of limitations may be tolled and the action may be considered timely if \"commenced within three years of the discovery of the wrongful act, neglect or default or within three years of when, in the exercise of reasonable diligence, the wrongful conduct should have been discovered.\"\n   <em>\n    Pari v. Corwin\n   </em>\n   ,\n   <extracted-citation case-ids=\"7351716\" index=\"5\" url=\"https://cite.case.law/a2d/620/86/#p87\">\n    620 A.2d 86\n   </extracted-citation>\n   , 87 (R.I. 1993) ;\n   <em>\n    see\n   </em>\n   \u00a7 10-7-2. Significantly, \"the Wrongful Death Act's focus [is] on the\n   <em>\n    act\n   </em>\n   that caused the death rather than the\n   <em>\n    actors\n   </em>\n   [.]\"\n   <em>\n    O'Connell v. Walmsley\n   </em>\n   ,\n   <extracted-citation case-ids=\"12323075\" index=\"6\" url=\"https://cite.case.law/a3d/156/422/#p428\">\n    156 A.3d 422\n   </extracted-citation>\n   , 428 (R.I. 2017) (emphases added) (internal parentheses omitted).\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-27\">\n   It is significant that Parrillo did not name Dr. Gregg as a defendant in this wrongful death action until she filed her second amended complaint in April 2016, more than four years after Mr. Santos's death.\n   <footnotemark>\n    4\n   </footnotemark>\n   She argues, however, that the statute of limitations set forth in \u00a7 10-7-2 should be tolled because she could not, in the exercise of reasonable diligence, have discovered the \"wrongful act, neglect or default\" of Dr. Gregg until February 2016, when he was finally identified by counsel for Rhode Island Hospital as an attending\n   physician during what is claimed to be a critical portion of Mr. Santos's fateful stay at Rhode Island Hospital. We do not agree.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-28\">\n   <strong>\n    A\n   </strong>\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-29\">\n   <strong>\n    The Wrongful Act, Not the Wrongful Actor\n   </strong>\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-30\">\n   Because it appears to us that Parrillo incorrectly interprets the arc of \u00a7 10-7-2, we begin our analysis with an examination of the text of the statute as well as our previous interpretations of it. As we have set forth\n   <em>\n    supra\n   </em>\n   , the fulcrum of the discovery rule in \u00a7 10-7-2 is \"the\n   <em>\n    act\n   </em>\n   that caused the death rather than the\n   <em>\n    actors\n   </em>\n   [.]\"\n   <em>\n    O'Connell\n   </em>\n   ,\n   <extracted-citation case-ids=\"12323075\" index=\"7\" url=\"https://cite.case.law/a3d/156/422/#p428\">\n    156 A.3d at 428\n   </extracted-citation>\n   (emphases added) (internal parentheses omitted). We therefore have no hesitation in concluding that Parrillo's focus on the identification of Dr. Gregg as a potential tortfeasor is misdirected. This is so because Parrillo's knowledge of the\n   <em>\n    wrongful conduct\n   </em>\n   began the running of the statute of limitations, not her belief that Dr. Gregg may have been the actor responsible for that conduct.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-31\">\n   Section 10-7-2 reads, in pertinent part:\n  </p>\n  <blockquote id=\"p-32\">\n   \"Except as otherwise provided, every action brought pursuant to this chapter shall be commenced within three (3) years after the death of the person. With respect to any death caused by any wrongful act, neglect or default which is not known at the time of death, the action shall be commenced within three (3) years of the time that the wrongful act, neglect or default is discovered or, in the exercise of reasonable diligence, should have been discovered.\"\n  </blockquote>\n  <p id=\"p-33\">\n   Importantly, it is clear from a reading of the text of the statute that it is a potential plaintiff's knowledge of the \"wrongful act, neglect or default\" that triggers the statute of limitations. Notably absent from the text of the statute is any mention of a potential plaintiff's knowledge of the\n   <em>\n    identity\n   </em>\n   of the alleged tortfeasor.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-34\">\n   Moreover, the date the plaintiff discovered the allegedly wrongful conduct has always been our lodestar when determining whether or not the statutory period for filing a wrongful death suit has expired. For example, in\n   <em>\n    Ashey v. Kupchan\n   </em>\n   ,\n   <extracted-citation case-ids=\"7371348\" index=\"8\" url=\"https://cite.case.law/a2d/618/1268/\">\n    618 A.2d 1268\n   </extracted-citation>\n   (R.I. 1993), the plaintiffs argued that, although they suspected at the time of their son's death that his demise had been caused by medical malpractice, it was not until they obtained an expert opinion on the matter, almost a year after the death, that their suspicions were confirmed.\n   <em>\n    Ashey\n   </em>\n   ,\n   <extracted-citation case-ids=\"7371348\" index=\"9\" url=\"https://cite.case.law/a2d/618/1268/\">\n    618 A.2d at 1269\n   </extracted-citation>\n   . The plaintiffs thus argued that \u00a7 10-7-2 should be tolled until the date the plaintiffs received that expert opinion.\n   <em>\n    <extracted-citation case-ids=\"7371348\" index=\"10\" url=\"https://cite.case.law/a2d/618/1268/\">\n     Id.\n    </extracted-citation>\n   </em>\n   We disagreed, reasoning that the operative date was not when the plaintiffs \"tracked down an expert to confirm their suspicions[.]\"\n   <em>\n    <extracted-citation case-ids=\"7371348\" index=\"11\" url=\"https://cite.case.law/a2d/618/1268/\">\n     Id.\n    </extracted-citation>\n   </em>\n   Instead, we held that \" Section 10-7-2 states that the discovery date is the date that the plaintiffs knew or should have known of the 'wrongful act' that is the basis of their lawsuit.\"\n   <em>\n    <extracted-citation case-ids=\"7371348\" index=\"12\" url=\"https://cite.case.law/a2d/618/1268/\">\n     Id.\n    </extracted-citation>\n   </em>\n   Because the plaintiffs were aware of the wrongful conduct shortly after their son's death but waited more than three years to file suit, \u00a7 10-7-2 time barred their claim.\n   <em>\n    <extracted-citation case-ids=\"7371348\" index=\"13\" url=\"https://cite.case.law/a2d/618/1268/\">\n     Id.\n    </extracted-citation>\n   </em>\n   <extracted-citation case-ids=\"7371348\" index=\"13\" url=\"https://cite.case.law/a2d/618/1268/\">\n    at 1270\n   </extracted-citation>\n   .\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-35\">\n   Similarly, in\n   <em>\n    Pari\n   </em>\n   , the plaintiffs were \"almost immediately aware\" that delays in referring their minor child to surgery had contributed to the child's death, but they nevertheless waited more than four years to file a wrongful death claim.\n   <em>\n    Pari\n   </em>\n   ,\n   <extracted-citation case-ids=\"7351716\" index=\"14\" url=\"https://cite.case.law/a2d/620/86/#p87\">\n    620 A.2d at 86-87\n   </extracted-citation>\n   .

To determine whether the plaintiff's claim was time barred by \u00a7 10-7-2, we were tasked with determining the date on which the plaintiff should have discovered the wrongful conduct that caused her husband's death-the date of her husband's accident or the date an expert opined on the sufficiency of the highway safety features.\n   <em>\n    <extracted-citation case-ids=\"11291604\" index=\"19\" url=\"https://cite.case.law/a2d/641/332/\">\n     Id.\n    </extracted-citation>\n   </em>\n   <extracted-citation case-ids=\"11291604\" index=\"19\" url=\"https://cite.case.law/a2d/641/332/\">\n    at 334\n   </extracted-citation>\n   .

Indeed, the conduct that Parrillo attributes to Dr. Gregg in the second amended complaint is in fact the very same conduct, pled almost word for word, that was alleged against the other defendants in Parrillo's original complaint.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-50\">\n   It cannot be gainsaid, therefore, that Parrillo knew what conduct she believed caused Mr. Santos's death within the three-year statutory period set by \u00a7 10-7-2. When she was deposed, Parrillo acknowledged that she had suspected shortly after Mr. Santos's death that his death had been caused by malpractice, and it was that suspicion that drove her to request his medical records from Rhode Island Hospital. She simply failed to name all of the potentially responsible parties, including Dr. Gregg, before the three-year statutory period for filing a wrongful death claim had expired. It is our conclusion, therefore, that Parrillo's wrongful death claim against Dr. Gregg is time barred.\n   <footnotemark>\n    9\n   </footnotemark>\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-51\">\n   In the face of a looming statute of limitations, plaintiffs are not devoid of options when they do not know the identity of all parties responsible for tortious conduct that they believe caused an injury. Mechanisms are available outside of \u00a7 10-7-2 that may preserve a claim while a plaintiff's investigation is ongoing. For example, G.L. 1956 \u00a7 9-5-20 allows plaintiffs to \"toll an applicable statute of limitations against a known but then unidentifiable defendant * * * by designating that unidentified defendant by means of a fictitious name, such as John Doe.\"\n   <em>\n    Grossi v. Miriam Hospital\n   </em>\n   ,\n   <extracted-citation case-ids=\"11924794\" index=\"44\" url=\"https://cite.case.law/a2d/689/403/#p404\">\n    689 A.2d 403\n   </extracted-citation>\n   , 404 (R.I. 1997) ;\n   <em>\n    see\n   </em>\n   \u00a7 9-5-20. It is true that, as Parrillo argues, she was in no way\n   <em>\n    required\n   </em>\n   to employ John Doe defendants or to make use of the rules of civil procedure to compel more responsive answers to the discovery requests that she maintains were answered in an opaque, confusing, and incomplete manner. Unfortunately, however, because Parrillo did not avail herself of these mechanisms, she was unprepared when the statutory period for filing a wrongful death claim against Dr. Gregg expired. Rhode Island's statute of limitations on wrongful death claims cannot be circumvented to accommodate Parrillo's failure to make use of the tools available to her.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-52\">\n   Our holding today underscores the importance of promptly and assiduously investigating the facts of one's claim. Despite obtaining Mr. Santos's medical records within months of his death, Parrillo did not file a wrongful death suit until January 2014 and did not even begin the process of discovery until February 2015-almost three years to the day after Mr. Santos's death. While a plaintiff's reasonable\n   diligence is not a prerequisite to tolling under \u00a7 10-7-2, as it is for other statutes of limitations, such as that for medical malpractice,\n   <em>\n    see\n   </em>\n   <em>\n    O'Sullivan\n   </em>\n   ,\n   <extracted-citation case-ids=\"8951447\" index=\"45\" url=\"https://cite.case.law/a2d/874/179/\">\n    874 A.2d at 185-86\n   </extracted-citation>\n   , plaintiffs must nevertheless \"investigate diligently who may or may not have had any exposure to liability during treatment\" lest the statute of limitations expire before they have filed claims against all of the responsible parties.\n   <em>\n    Dionne v.

As we said in\n   <em>\n    Benner\n   </em>\n   , \"[w]ithout question, [a potential plaintiff] must carry out both factual and legal investigations of varying durations. * * * This does not mean that the statute of limitations will be tolled until the investigation is complete.

However, as we observed in\n    <em>\n     O'Sullivan\n    </em>\n    and reiterate above in footnote six, \"[i]n the usual situation, the plaintiff would be aware of the wrong (or the reasonably suspected wrong) at or immediately following the death and would know at that time which defendants should be named.\"\n    <em>\n     O'Sullivan\n    </em>\n    ,\n    <extracted-citation case-ids=\"8951447\" index=\"62\" url=\"https://cite.case.law/a2d/874/179/\">\n     874 A.2d at 187\n    </extracted-citation>\n    . Nonetheless, because Parrillo did not name Dr. Gregg as a defendant until more than three years after both Mr. Santos's death and Parrillo's receipt of the medical records, we need not, and do not, express an opinion as to whether the statute of limitations began running on the date of Mr. Santos's death or on the date that Parrillo received Mr. Santos's medical records.\n   </p>\n  </footnote>\n  <footnote label=\"9\">\n   <p id=\"p-68\">\n    Parrillo also briefly, and without citing any caselaw, contends that Rhode Island Hospital's answers to interrogatories were so unclear that they amounted to intentional obfuscation of Dr. Gregg's role in Mr. Santos's medical care. Parrillo cites to G.L. 1956 \u00a7 9-1-20, which, she contends, tolls the statute of limitations if the defendant acted in any way to conceal the existence of a cause of action.\n    <em>\n     See\n    </em>\n    \u00a7 9-1-20. Assuming, without deciding, that this bare bones argument was sufficiently developed in Parrillo's brief, we nonetheless observe that \u00a7 9-1-20 applies only where \"the party asserting the statute-of-limitations defense attempted by fraud or misrepresentation to conceal the existence of the cause of action.\"\n    <em>\n     Renaud\n    </em>\n    ,\n    <extracted-citation case-ids=\"7864241\" index=\"63\" url=\"https://cite.case.law/a2d/662/711/#p715\">\n     662 A.2d at 714\n    </extracted-citation>\n    (internal punctuation omitted). It is not sufficient to allege that one defendant has acted to conceal a cause of action against another defendant.\n    <em>\n     See\n     <extracted-citation case-ids=\"7864241\" index=\"64\" url=\"https://cite.case.law/a2d/662/711/#p715\">\n      id.\n     </extracted-citation>\n    </em>\n    Parrillo takes issue only with the discovery provided by Rhode Island Hospital, and does not allege any obfuscation on the part of Dr. Gregg, the party asserting the statute of limitations defense. Therefore, even though we agree with Parrillo that Rhode Island Hospital's interrogatory answers were not particularly transparent, we nonetheless conclude that \u00a7 9-1-20 is inapplicable to this case.\n   </p>\n  </footnote>\n </opinion>\n</casebody>\n"
