Accordingly, we affirm the judgments.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-15\">\n   I.

The children have the same mother but different fathers. The children now reside in the safe and healthy home of their maternal grandmother. A District Court parental rights and responsibilities order regarding Riahleigh and a Probate Court guardianship order regarding MyAnnah placed the children in the grandmother's care. In early 2015, the grandmother filed petitions in the Probate Court to adopt the two children and petitions to terminate each parent's parental rights.\n   <footnotemark>\n    2\n   </footnotemark>\n   The court appointed counsel for the mother and each father.\n   <em>\n    See\n   </em>\n   18-A M.R.S. \u00a7 9-106(a) (2017).\n   <footnotemark>\n    3\n   </footnotemark>\n   It also appointed a guardian ad litem in each matter.\n   <em>\n    See\n   </em>\n   18-A M.R.S. \u00a7 9-204(c) (2017).\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-18\">\n   [\u00b65] The mother and both fathers unsuccessfully moved for the court to order the provision of rehabilitation and reunification services consistent with the services that would have been available if a court had found abuse or neglect or the children had been placed in foster care in a child protection matter.\n   <em>\n    Cf.\n   </em>\n   22 M.R.S. \u00a7\u00a7 4036-B, 4041 (2017). Neither of the fathers specified in his motion what specific services he wanted to receive, apart from a generic request by the father of MyAnnah that services include \"visitation, parenting counseling, and mental health counseling.\" Neither motion requested payment for the services from any specific party or from the State, nor did either father argue that any specific services were designed to remedy particular parenting deficits.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-19\">\n   [\u00b66] The court scheduled separate trials on the two termination petitions, but before either trial was held, the mother consented to the termination of her parental rights to both children to enable the grandmother to adopt the children. The trials were therefore limited to the question of whether the fathers' parental rights should be terminated.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-20\">\n   [\u00b67] After each trial, the court entered a judgment\n   <footnotemark>\n    4\n   </footnotemark>\n   terminating that father's parental rights upon finding that the father was unwilling or unable to protect his child from jeopardy and that these circumstances were unlikely to change within a time reasonably calculated to meet her needs, that he was unwilling or unable to take responsibility for his child within a time reasonably calculated to meet her needs, and that termination of the father's parental rights was in his child's best interest.\n   <em>\n    See\n   </em>\n   22 M.R.S. \u00a7 4055(1)(A)(2), (B)(2)(a), (b)(i)-(ii) (2017). Each father timely appealed, and we invited amicus briefs on the constitutional issues raised by the fathers in their briefs. We now consider both appeals.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-21\">\n   II. DISCUSSION\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-22\">\n   [\u00b68] In this opinion, we first summarize the statutory basis for the Department's obligation to provide rehabilitation and reunification services to parents in title 22 child protection matters. We then address the fathers' arguments that the Due Process and Equal Protection Clauses of the federal and state constitutions require that parents be provided with similar services by court order in private adoption matters in which petitions to terminate parental rights have been filed. Finally, we review the court's findings and discretionary determinations in support of the termination judgments.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-23\">\n   A. Statutory Obligation to Provide Rehabilitation and Reunification Services\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-24\">\n   [\u00b69] The Department's obligation to provide rehabilitation and reunification services is triggered in a title 22 child protection matter when a parent is found to have subjected a child to abuse or neglect or a child has been removed from the home for sixty days. 22 M.R.S. \u00a7 4041(1-A). In those circumstances, the Department is ordinarily\n   <footnotemark>\n    5\n   </footnotemark>\n   required to formulate a rehabilitation and reunification plan that includes the following:\n  </p>\n  <blockquote id=\"p-25\">\n   <strong>\n    (iv)\n   </strong>\n   Services that must be provided or made available to assist the parent in rehabilitating and reunifying with the child, as appropriate to the child and family, including, but not limited to, reasonable transportation for the parent for visits and services, child care, housing assistance, assistance with transportation to and from required services and other services that support reunification; [and]\n  </blockquote>\n  <blockquote id=\"p-26\">\n   <strong>\n    (v)\n   </strong>\n   A schedule of and conditions for visits between the child and the parent designed to provide the parent and child time together in settings that provide as positive a parent-child interaction as can practicably be achieved while ensuring the emotional and physical well-being of the child when visits are not detrimental to the child's best interests.\n  </blockquote>\n  <p id=\"p-27\">\n   22 M.R.S. \u00a7 4041(1-A)(A)(1)(c).\n   <footnotemark>\n    6\n   </footnotemark>\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-28\">\n   [\u00b610] It is the parent, however, who ultimately bears the responsibility to rehabilitate\n   and reunify with the child.\n   <em>\n    See\n   </em>\n   22 M.R.S. \u00a7 4041(1-A)(B). The parental responsibilities identified in that statute require the parent to \"[r]ectify and resolve problems that prevent the return of the child to the home,\" to \"[s]eek and utilize appropriate services to assist in rehabilitating and reunifying with the child,\" and to \"[p]ay reasonable sums toward the support of the child within the limits of the parent's ability to pay.\"\n   <em>\n    <extracted-citation case-ids=\"12328376\" index=\"2\" url=\"https://cite.case.law/a3d/169/914/\">\n     Id.\n    </extracted-citation>\n   </em>\n   \u00a7 4041(1-A)(B)(1), (5), (6).\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-29\">\n   [\u00b611] Thus, the parent has the obligation to remedy the parenting deficits that resulted in the removal or the finding of abuse or neglect, and the Department bears a responsibility to \"make reasonable efforts to rehabilitate and reunify the family,\" including by making services available to the family. 22 M.R.S. \u00a7 4036-B(4) ;\n   <em>\n    see also\n   </em>\n   <em>\n    <extracted-citation case-ids=\"12328376\" index=\"3\" url=\"https://cite.case.law/a3d/169/914/\">\n     id.\n    </extracted-citation>\n   </em>\n   \u00a7 4041(1-A)(A), (B).\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-30\">\n   [\u00b612] In the absence of a judicial finding of abuse or neglect or removal from the home, however, the Department does not bear the same statutory responsibilities. When a dispute exists between or among private parties in a family matter, including in an adoption proceeding, neither the Department nor any of the other parties has a statutorily created obligation to provide or participate in rehabilitation and reunification services for a parent whose rights are at stake.\n   <em>\n    Adoption of Isabelle T.\n   </em>\n   ,\n   <extracted-citation case-ids=\"12422499\" index=\"4\" url=\"https://cite.case.law/a3d/175/639/\">\n    2017 ME 220\n   </extracted-citation>\n   , \u00b6 12,\n   <extracted-citation case-ids=\"12422499\" index=\"5\" url=\"https://cite.case.law/a3d/175/639/\">\n    175 A.3d 639\n   </extracted-citation>\n   .

Each father could have, but did not, complete a batterer intervention program to satisfy the court-ordered condition to any contact he could have with his child. Each father remained inattentive to his child's needs after engaging in violent acts against the mother-one father's violence causing the mother to seek medical care and resulting in trauma to Riahleigh, and the other father's violence having been inflicted during and after the mother's pregnancy with MyAnnah. In short, both fathers could have taken steps to be better able to challenge the grandmother's assertion that they are parentally unfit, but neither of them did so.\n   </p>\n  </footnote>\n  <footnote label=\"19\">\n   <p id=\"p-99\">\n    The California Supreme Court cited this case with approval in\n    <em>\n     In re Nolan W.\n    </em>\n    ,\n    <extracted-citation case-ids=\"3893080\" index=\"126\" url=\"https://cite.case.law/cal-4th/45/1217/\">\n     45 Cal.4th 1217\n    </extracted-citation>\n    ,\n    <extracted-citation index=\"127\" url=\"https://cite.case.law/citations/?q=91%20Cal.%20Rptr.%203d%20140\">\n     91 Cal.Rptr.3d 140\n    </extracted-citation>\n    ,\n    <extracted-citation index=\"128\" url=\"https://cite.case.law/citations/?q=203%20P.3d%20454\">\n     203 P.3d 454\n    </extracted-citation>\n    , 460 (2009).\n   </p>\n  </footnote>\n </opinion>\n</casebody>\n"
