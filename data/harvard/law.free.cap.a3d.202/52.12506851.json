After careful review, we hold that the declaration did not establish the extent or effect of the taking. Accordingly, the failure to file preliminary objections within thirty days of service did not result in waiver of the right to assert ownership and seek just compensation, and therefore we affirm the decision of the Commonwealth Court to\n   remand the matter for an evidentiary hearing.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-8\">\n   Appellees, Steven and Mary Szabo, own real property located at 3101 Washington Road, McMurry, Pennsylvania where they operate a hair salon and skin care business. The property, which abuts both Route 19 and Old Washington Road, is improved with a parking lot and commercial structure. Appellant, the Pennsylvania Department of Transportation (PennDOT or Department) developed a road expansion plan to connect Route 19 with Old Washington Road by means of an exit ramp that would run across a section of the Szabos land, identified in the declaration of taking as Parcel 5. The Department attempted to purchase the property from the Szabos; however, the parties could not come to an agreement.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-9\">\n   On January 10, 2013, after six months of negotiations, PennDOT served the Szabos with a declaration of taking for a 1.040 acre right of way, and a 1.729 acre temporary construction easement on Parcel 5, for the purpose of expanding State Route 19. Declaration of Taking Property Plan, 12/3/12 at Sheet 1 of 2. The plot plan stated that Parcel 5 had an effective size of 3.128 acres, and the declaration of taking marked the right of way seized from Parcel 5 as required under Section 305.\n   <footnotemark>\n    1\n   </footnotemark>\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-10\">\n   The plot plan served with the declaration also listed two adjacent parcels of land, Parcels 1 and 9. The owners of Parcel 1 were listed as Edward A. Courtney, Jr. and Susan H. Courtney, H &amp; W (1/2 Interest) &amp; Heirs of Eveline H. Roach; Being Bessie A. Fife Her Heirs and Assigns (1/2 Interest), and the owner of Parcel 9 was listed as The Home Rule Municipality of Peters Township.\n   <em>\n    Id.\n   </em>\n   at Sheet 1 of 2. Lines demarcating Parcel 5 from Parcels 1 and 9 were labeled \"probable [sic] correct\" and a property note indicated that \"the Gerrick\n   <footnotemark>\n    2\n   </footnotemark>\n   plan, dated September 1996 ... was not used for the Szabo boundary lines.\"\n   <em>\n    Id.\n   </em>\n   The note described several errors discovered within the chain of title, including a distance line of 178.2 feet, mislabeled as 270 feet, and an unrecorded outsale to the Montour Railroad Company, which was then transferred to the Home Rule Municipality of Peters Township in 1985.\n   <em>\n    Id.\n   </em>\n   The lower portion of both plans stated the \"private property lines are plotted from the deed of record,\" but noted those lines \"were not surveyed by the professional land surveyor responsible for the project\" and advised \"this property plot is not to be substituted for a boundary survey.\"\n   <em>\n    Id.\n   </em>\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-11\">\n   Importantly, the plot plans attached to the declaration of taking did not indicate that any portions of Parcels 1 and 9 were condemned. Moreover, the plot plan failed to illustrate that Parcel 1 was condemned on November 8, 2012, and Peters Township conveyed Parcel 9 to PennDOT by deed in lieu of condemnation, recorded on June 26, 2012. Thus, the Szabos were provided with notice solely of the portion of Parcel 5, which was correctly marked as owned by the Szabos, that was to be condemned.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-12\">\n   Correspondence attached to the notice of condemnation advised the Szabos that they had the right to receive estimated just compensation for land taken from\n   Parcel 5 in the amount of $ 587,000 and their acceptance of payment would in no way jeopardize their right to petition the court to appoint a board of viewers to determine the precise amount of compensation to which they were entitled. A memorandum of law attached to the declaration informed the Szabos they could, within 30 days, file preliminary objections to challenge the declaration of taking.\n   <footnotemark>\n    3\n   </footnotemark>\n   Because the Szabos had no objection to the portion of Parcel 5 indicated as condemned, the Szabos did not file preliminary objections.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-13\">\n   On April 8, 2013, PennDOT deposited $ 587,000 estimated just compensation with the Court of Common Pleas of Washington County (Trial Court). On December 12, 2013, the Szabos filed a petition for the appointment of viewers pursuant to Section 502\n   <footnotemark>\n    4\n   </footnotemark>\n   to determine just compensation for the condemnation of Parcel 5. Petition for Evidentiary Hearing, 5/13/15, at \u00b6\u00b6 4-5. The trial court appointed a board of viewers and the Szabos requested and received their estimated just compensation of $ 587,000 from the trial court. A hearing before the board of viewers was scheduled for May 21, 2015.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-14\">\n   On May 13, 2015, the Szabos asserted for the first time that the ownership interests provided in the declaration of taking were incorrect and filed a petition for an evidentiary hearing with the trial court. The petition informed the court that the Szabos had recently hired a registered surveyor to prepare a plan depicting their property. The surveyor's plan demonstrated that the plan attached to the declaration of taking was inaccurate in that it failed to show the entire property owned by the Szabos prior to condemnation. Petition for Evidentiary Hearing, 5/13/15, at \u00b6 7. The Szabos notified PennDOT of the error, produced the survey prepared for them by the registered surveyor, offered to meet with PennDOT to demonstrate the results of the title search performed by the Commonwealth Land Title Company, and requested the official plan be changed. In response, PennDOT denied that its plans were erroneous, and all attempts at remedy failed. The Szabos therefore requested, \"due to the issue of fact regarding the extent and nature of the property interest condemned and the owners thereof, an evidentiary hearing ... to resolve said issue.\"\n   <em>\n    Id.\n   </em>\n   at 9.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-15\">\n   In its answer to the petition, PennDOT admitted that while Section 504(d)(5)\n   <footnotemark>\n    5\n   </footnotemark>\n   of the Code mandates that an evidentiary hearing be conducted by the court and not the board of viewers, it was inapplicable in this instance because Section 504(d)(5) does so only in the specific context in which issues are raised through preliminary objections. Further, PennDOT denied that the plans included with the declaration of taking were inaccurate, stating that strict proof is demanded at the time of hearing demonstrating ownership. Notwithstanding the request for proof, PennDOT argued that the trial court did not have jurisdiction to address the averments raised by the Szabos because the Szabos admittedly had not raised these issues within thirty days of service of the declaration of taking. Consequently, issues related to the extent and nature of the property interest condemned were waived under Section 306. The trial court directed the parties to file briefs.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-16\">\n   In their brief to the trial court, the Szabos repeated that the plan did not adequately establish the extent or effect of the taking because it did not show the entirety of their property interests prior to the condemnation. Accordingly, they argued their claim should not be subject to waiver under Section 306.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-17\">\n   PennDOT, in response, emphasized waiver under Section 306, and asserted that the trial court did not have jurisdiction over these issues because they had not been raised within thirty days of receipt of the declaration of taking. It stated \"substantial prejudice\" to the Department would result from raising an issue \"which is so basic to the case\" beyond the span of thirty days. Brief in Opposition to Plaintiffs' Petition for Evidentiary Hearing, 6/12/2015, at 8.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-18\">\n   On August 17, 2015, the trial court denied the Szabos' Petition for Evidentiary Hearing. In ruling against the Szabos, the court noted that \"there [was] no dispute as to what property PennDOT desire[d] to take -- the Szabos [did] not argue that the geographical boundaries of PennDOT's plan [were] ambiguous.\" Trial Ct. Op., 8/17/15, at 3. Further, the court concluded that \"there [was] no dispute about the effect of the taking, i.e. what impact it would have on the remainder of the Szabos' property interest.\"\n   <em>\n    Id.\n   </em>\n   Characterizing a failure in \"extent or effect\" as fundamentally a question of notice to the landowner at the time the declaration is filed, and citing\n   <em>\n    In re Commonwealth, Department of General Services\n   </em>\n   ,\n   <extracted-citation case-ids=\"11720041\" index=\"0\" url=\"https://cite.case.law/a2d/714/1159/\">\n    714 A.2d 1159\n   </extracted-citation>\n   (Pa.

Com., Dep't of Transp.\n   </em>\n   ,\n   <extracted-citation case-ids=\"12329784\" index=\"2\" url=\"https://cite.case.law/a3d/159/604/#p606\">\n    159 A.3d 604\n   </extracted-citation>\n   , 606 (Pa. Cmwlth. 2017).\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-20\">\n   The Commonwealth Court reversed the decision of the trial court in a unanimous opinion and remanded for an evidentiary hearing to determine the property interests affected by the taking and the proper compensation for the condemned property. The Commonwealth Court explained that Section 305 requires the condemnor to provide written notice within thirty days of the filing of a declaration of taking. To comply with the Code, notice must contain a reasonable identification of the property. 26 Pa.C.S. \u00a7 305(c)(8). The court explained that in\n   <em>\n    Department of General Services\n   </em>\n   , it held that a landowner did not waive the issue of\n   <em>\n    de facto\n   </em>\n   taking by failing to raise that issue in preliminary objections where \"the Declaration of Taking did not adequately establish the extent or effect of the taking.\"\n   <em>\n    Szabo\n   </em>\n   ,\n   <extracted-citation case-ids=\"12329784\" index=\"3\" url=\"https://cite.case.law/a3d/159/604/#p606\">\n    159 A.3d at\n   </extracted-citation>\n   608 (citing\n   <em>\n    Dep't of Gen. Servs.\n   </em>\n   ,\n   <extracted-citation case-ids=\"11720041\" index=\"4\" url=\"https://cite.case.law/a2d/714/1159/\">\n    714 A.2d at\n   </extracted-citation>\n   1162 ). In that case, the Department of General Services (DGS) seized a right of way from a condemnee's riverfront property, limiting access to the section of remaining property which adjoined the river. DGS agreed to perform a site survey, but did not do so, and the condemnee requested an evidentiary hearing. DGS asserted that the issue of\n   <em>\n    de facto\n   </em>\n   condemnation should have been raised through preliminary objections and was therefore waived. The Commonwealth Court held otherwise, citing the holding in\n   <em>\n    Greenfield Township\n   </em>\n   that \"landowners who were unaware at the time a declaration of taking was filed that a portion of their property would be landlocked as a result of the condemnation, did not waive the issue in preliminary objections to the declaration of taking.\"\n   <em>\n    Dep't of Gen. Servs.\n   </em>\n   ,\n   <extracted-citation case-ids=\"11720041\" index=\"5\" url=\"https://cite.case.law/a2d/714/1159/\">\n    714 A.2d at 1162\n   </extracted-citation>\n   .\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-21\">\n   Here, PennDOT filed plans which illustrated the proposed taking and identified the parties and their affected property interests. The Commonwealth Court explained that the plans incorrectly identified property owned by the Szabos as owned by other parties. The Szabos only discovered this error after PennDOT began construction and the Szabos hired a surveyor. Accordingly, because the Department failed to accurately identify the property that was part of the taking, the Commonwealth Court concluded PennDOT took from the Szabos more than was indicated in the plans without providing adequate compensation.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-22\">\n   Addressing the second argument, that of waiver, the Commonwealth Court noted that because PennDOT did not provide adequate notice, the Szabos' subsequent discovery resulted in a\n   <em>\n    de facto\n   </em>\n   taking.\n   <footnotemark>\n    7\n   </footnotemark>\n   The Szabos argued that under the trial court's holding, they, not PennDOT, bore the burden of preparing accurate plans. This would force a condemnee to file\n   preliminary objections in every case regardless of whether a basis existed at the time, so as to avoid waiver. PennDOT reiterated that it had provided proper notice and argued that Section 306 provides that preliminary objections are the exclusive means of challenging the nature and extent of the property interest by the condemnee. Accordingly, the Szabos should not be afforded an evidentiary hearing. Again, citing\n   <em>\n    Department of General Services\n   </em>\n   , the Commonwealth Court noted that \"the courts have recognized that a condemnee does not waive such issues where the declaration of taking does not adequately establish the extent or effect of the taking.\"\n   <em>\n    Szabo\n   </em>\n   ,\n   <extracted-citation case-ids=\"12329784\" index=\"6\" url=\"https://cite.case.law/a3d/159/604/#p606\">\n    159 A.3d at 608\n   </extracted-citation>\n   . Here, PennDOT did not adequately identify the property. Therefore, the plans did not adequately establish the extent or effect of the taking, and the Szabos did not waive their right to raise the issue. Accordingly, the Commonwealth Court remanded for an evidentiary hearing.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-23\">\n   PennDOT filed a petition for allowance of appeal raising two questions, which this Court granted. The Department asks this Court:\n  </p>\n  <blockquote id=\"p-24\">\n   (1) By failing to file preliminary objections pursuant to section 306 of the Eminent Domain Code, 26 Pa.C.S. 306, did [Appellees] waive their right to assert ownership and seek additional just compensation for the condemnation of two parcels which were allegedly mistakenly depicted as belonging to two other legal entities in plans attached to the declaration of taking?\n  </blockquote>\n  <blockquote id=\"p-25\">\n   (2) Did [Appellant's] alleged mistake in the plans attached to a declaration of taking, constitute the failure to adequately establish the extent or effect of the taking, thereby excusing [appellees] from filing preliminary objections under section 306 of the Eminent Domain Code.

In\n   <em>\n    Bernstein Appeal\n   </em>\n   , the Commonwealth filed preliminary objections to the condemnee's petition for appointment of viewers, asserting waiver. The matter began in 1971 when PennDOT condemned an easement interest for construction of the Vine Street Expressway. PennDOT revised the plan and filed a second taking on July 25, 1984, taking the fee title underlying the easement. The condemnees did not file preliminary objections and instead petitioned for the appointment of a board of viewers. PennDOT filed preliminary objections, and the condemnees answered, averring that PennDOT had abandoned the original easement by changing its planned use, and that the new use as a parking garage was not a valid transportation purpose. At issue in that case was whether these claims were waived for failure to file preliminary objections. The court noted that \"the nature of the property interest a party possesses, if any, in an eminent domain proceeding is properly raised by way of preliminary objections. And the failure to raise the issue by means of preliminary objections constitutes a waiver of such issues.\"\n   <em>\n    Bernstein Appeal\n   </em>\n   ,\n   <extracted-citation case-ids=\"1368055\" index=\"20\" url=\"https://cite.case.law/pa-commw/112/368/#p1214\">\n    535 A.2d at 1214\n   </extracted-citation>\n   (internal citations omitted). Because the issues challenged the condemnor's power to acquire the premises, they should have been raised by way of preliminary objections and the court found them waived.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-50\">\n   In\n   <em>\n    West Whiteland\n   </em>\n   , the Commonwealth Court was asked to determine whether a condemnee was required to raise the unity of purpose doctrine set forth in then-Section 605\n   <footnotemark>\n    8\n   </footnotemark>\n   through preliminary objections. In 1989, PennDOT filed a notice of taking for 23.866 acres of unimproved property from a 71.526 acre parcel. The condemnee did not file preliminary objections. Four years later, the condemnee petitioned for the appointment of a board of viewers. At the hearing, the condemnee's witness testified that the property before condemnation was actually 179 acres based upon the unity of purpose doctrine. The board based its report upon the 179 acre parcel, and the trial court affirmed. The Commonwealth Court reversed, accepting PennDOT's argument that it had \"served on Condemnee a plot plan and property plat which showed the Condemnee's entire property before condemnation was 71.526 acres, the area taken was 23.866 acres, and the after condemnation area was 47.66\n   acres.\"\n   <em>\n    West Whiteland\n   </em>\n   ,\n   <extracted-citation case-ids=\"11926460\" index=\"21\" url=\"https://cite.case.law/a2d/690/1266/\">\n    690 A.2d at 1268\n   </extracted-citation>\n   . Noting that \"[t]he plot plans and property plat filed with the declaration of taking and served upon a condemnee are part of and indeed, the heart of a declaration of taking,\" and with citation to\n   <em>\n    Bernstein Appeal\n   </em>\n   , the court held that the trial court erred in allowing the condemnee to assert unity of purpose after thirty days.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-51\">\n   Here, PennDOT asserts the plans clearly depict Edward Courtney, Jr. and Susan Courtney and Peters Township to be the owners, respectively, of Parcels 1 and 9. Thus, this clear error should have been resolved through preliminary objections. PennDOT further avers notice was proper because it adequately established the extent or effect of the taking. It contends the Szabos had notice of the property to be condemned for the highway project after six months of prior settlement negotiations from June 2012 until the declaration of taking was filed in January 2013. Because the original and revised plans depict the parcels to be condemned, they satisfy the Section 305(c)(8)-(11) requirements for notice. Further, PennDOT distinguishes the instant case from\n   <em>\n    Department of General Services\n   </em>\n   and\n   <em>\n    Greenfield Township\n   </em>\n   , which involved\n   <em>\n    de facto\n   </em>\n   takings. It avers that in each case, the condemnees failed to file preliminary objections because they were unaware and could not have known at the time of the taking that their properties would become landlocked. PennDOT summarizes the holdings as such: \"a condemnee may file preliminary objections more than 30 days after a taking if condemnees could not have known that additional property not identified in the declaration of taking would be taken as a consequence of being landlocked.\" Appellant's Brief at 21. Returning to the instant factual situation, PennDOT recounts that the Szabos were aware of the property being condemned, filed a petition for appointment of board of viewers, accepted compensation for Parcel 5, and did not raise any issue regarding the ownership of Parcels 1 and 9 until May 13, 2015, seventeen months after they had filed for appointment of a board of viewers.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-52\">\n   The Szabos contend that PennDOT perpetrated a\n   <em>\n    de facto\n   </em>\n   taking of Parcels 1 and 9 when it did not include them in the\n   <em>\n    de jure\n   </em>\n   declaration of taking for Parcel 5 and identified them as being owned by other parties. They note that PennDOT complied with Section 305 notice when it filed the Declaration of Taking for Parcel 5 on January 10, 2013. However, Parcel 1 was condemned on November 8, 2012, and Peters Township conveyed Parcel 9 to PennDOT by deed in lieu of condemnation, recorded on June 26, 2012. The Szabos explain that their declaration of taking did not mention either of these dates, or comply with the requirements of Section 305 for Parcels 1 and 9. They note that whether service of a notice of condemnation complied with the explicit requirements of the Code is a pure question of law, and the evidence shows that the declaration of taking filed on January 10, 2013, condemned portions of Parcel 5 only.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-53\">\n   The Szabos assert that errors inherent in the plans provided by PennDOT failed to provide notice and adequately establish the extent or effect of the taking. They note that \"a landowner's failure to file preliminary objections to a declaration of taking of one portion of his property does not preclude the subsequent allegation of a\n   <em>\n    de facto\n   </em>\n   taking of another portion of his property.\"\n   <em>\n    Snitzer, Pennsylvania Eminent Domain\n   </em>\n   , \u00a7 3.6.1, p. 69 (2017 ed.) (citing\n   <em>\n    In re Condemnation by Com., Dep't of Transp.

When a landowner is unaware at the time the declaration of taking is filed that a subsequent\n   <em>\n    de facto\n   </em>\n   taking of another property they owned would occur,\n   the declaration of taking failed to adequately establish the extent or effect of the taking.\n   <em>\n    In re Com., Dep't of Gen. Servs.\n   </em>\n   ,\n   <extracted-citation case-ids=\"11720041\" index=\"23\" url=\"https://cite.case.law/a2d/714/1159/\">\n    714 A.2d 1159\n   </extracted-citation>\n   (Pa. Cmwlth. 1998). The Szabos contend that PennDOT's argument is based upon two faulty premises. The first is that the issues raised are related to the declaration of taking and filing which condemned Parcel 5, and the second is that the Parcel 5 condemnation plan provided proper notice of the condemnation for Parcel 1 and 9. The Szabos explain that the declaration of taking filed on January 10, 2013, never stated or implied that Parcels 1 and 9 were related to the\n   <em>\n    de jure\n   </em>\n   condemnation action. Thus, their issue of ownership is not related to the Parcel 5 declaration of taking.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-54\">\n   Second, the Szabos assert the revised acquisition plan did not provide constructive notice that PennDOT condemned Parcels 1 and 9. \"[L]imitation on owner's right to claim damages in condemnation cannot begin to run until after the owner has had notice, actual or constructive, that his property has been condemned.\"\n   <em>\n    Strong Appeal\n   </em>\n   ,\n   <extracted-citation case-ids=\"1292514\" index=\"24\" url=\"https://cite.case.law/pa/400/51/\">\n    400 Pa. 51\n   </extracted-citation>\n   ,\n   <extracted-citation index=\"25\" url=\"https://cite.case.law/citations/?q=161%20A.2d%20380\">\n    161 A.2d 380\n   </extracted-citation>\n   , 384 (1960). Further, the Szabos emphasize that the state and federal constitutions protect property rights.\n   <footnotemark>\n    9\n   </footnotemark>\n   They equate this case with\n   <em>\n    Strong Appeal\n   </em>\n   and\n   <em>\n    Pagni v. Commonwealth\n   </em>\n   ,\n   <extracted-citation case-ids=\"727595\" index=\"26\" url=\"https://cite.case.law/pa-super/179/213/\">\n    179 Pa.Super. 213\n   </extracted-citation>\n   ,\n   <extracted-citation index=\"27\" url=\"https://cite.case.law/citations/?q=116%20A.2d%20294\">\n    116 A.2d 294\n   </extracted-citation>\n   (1955), where statutes of limitations were deemed inapplicable due to improper notice.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-55\">\n   In\n   <em>\n    Strong Appeal\n   </em>\n   , the Commonwealth approved a highway expansion plan in 1924, but did not act upon the plan until 1950. Under then-existing law, Section 61 allowed the Commissioner of Highways to divert a \"dangerous\" or \"inconvenient\" road with a plan approved by the governor and filed with the Department of Highways in Harrisburg. 36 P.S. \u00a7 61. The Commonwealth argued that the six-year statute of limitations barred the petition for damages, and the condemnees countered that they did not have adequate notice of the taking, which was filed in Harrisburg. Noting that Article 1, Section 10 of our Constitution provides that just compensation must be secured under authority of law for the public taking of property, this Court held that a limitation upon an owner's right to claim damages in condemnation cannot begin to run until he has had notice, actual or constructive, that his property has been condemned. This Court explained \"[w]e are of the opinion that the constitutional requirements of just compensation outweigh the Statute of Limitations in this type of case and require actual notice such as entry on the land or the giving of a bond to the landowner.\"\n   <em>\n    Strong Appeal\n   </em>\n   ,\n   <extracted-citation index=\"28\" url=\"https://cite.case.law/citations/?q=161%20A.2d%20380\">\n    161 A.2d at 383\n   </extracted-citation>\n   .

However, it did not act upon those plans until 1948, by which time the six-year statute of\n   limitations to challenge the taking had run. The Commonwealth argued that resulting challenges were waived. The Superior Court held otherwise, noting that \"[s]tatutes concerning eminent domain are to be strictly construed,\" and \"[i]t is a fundamental provision of both our state and federal constitutions that no person shall be deprived of property except by the law of the land or due process of law.

Accordingly, the Superior Court held that the claim was not barred.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-57\">\n   The Szabos, assert that here, as in\n   <em>\n    Strong Appeal\n   </em>\n   and\n   <em>\n    Pagni\n   </em>\n   , the Commonwealth agency did not adequately provide notice of the taking. As a result, their petition for an evidentiary hearing should not have been denied for failure to raise it within the thirty-day timeframe for filing of preliminary objections.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-58\">\n   We find this argument compelling given the fundamental protections of a person's property enumerated in our Constitution. Article 1, Section 1 includes \"[a]cquiring, possessing and protecting property\" among the inherent rights of mankind, and Article 1 Section 10, dictates that \"private property [shall not] be taken or applied to public use without authority of law and without just compensation being first made or secured.\" Pa. Const. Art. 1 \u00a7\u00a7 1, 10. These tenets have been codified by the General Assembly, which directs that \"provisions conferring the power of eminent domain\" are to be strictly construed under the rules of statutory interpretation. 1 Pa.C.S. \u00a7 1928(b)(4). The Eminent Domain Code must be applied in concert with these principles.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-59\">\n   Section 305 states that written notice shall be given to the condemnee within thirty days of the filing of a declaration of taking. 26 Pa.C.S. \u00a7 305. Notice shall include \"in the case of a partial taking, a plot plan showing the condemnee's entire property and the area taken.\" 26 Pa.C.S. \u00a7 305(9). The Szabos state, and we agree, that PennDOT did not satisfy this requirement when it served a plot plan informing them of the section of property taken from Parcel 5, but not Parcels 1 and 9. The plans provided to the Szabos did not show which portions of Parcels 1 and 9 were to be condemned, and did not identify that land as owned by the Szabos.\n   <footnotemark>\n    10\n   </footnotemark>\n   As the\n   <em>\n    Pagni\n   </em>\n   court explained, \"where, as here, the party (Commonwealth) setting up the limitation has been solely responsible for\n   the delay it will be prevented from taking this advantage.\"\n   <em>\n    Pagni\n   </em>\n   ,\n   <extracted-citation index=\"37\" url=\"https://cite.case.law/citations/?q=116%20A.2d%20294\">\n    116 A.2d at 296\n   </extracted-citation>\n   . \"Ordinarily in this type of case the person deceived has been led into a sense of security ... by actions or statements of the party setting up the statute.\"\n   <em>\n    <extracted-citation index=\"38\" url=\"https://cite.case.law/citations/?q=116%20A.2d%20294\">\n     Id.\n    </extracted-citation>\n   </em>\n   Given the extensive period of time in which the parties were negotiating for purchase, and the language of Section 305 providing that condemnees' entire property must be shown to them with the condemned portions outlined, we conclude that just such an event occurred in this case.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-60\">\n   Further, PennDOT's reliance on\n   <em>\n    West Whiteland\n   </em>\n   is misplaced. Significantly, in that case, PennDOT correctly identified the owner of the condemned property in the property plans and plat it provided in accordance with then-Section 405.\n   <em>\n    West Whiteland\n   </em>\n   ,\n   <extracted-citation case-ids=\"11926460\" index=\"39\" url=\"https://cite.case.law/a2d/690/1266/\">\n    690 A.2d at 1267\n   </extracted-citation>\n   . This effectively placed the condemnee on notice of his property interests which were impacted by the proposed taking. Four years later, the condemnee attempted to attach un-condemned property to the existing taking via the unity of purpose doctrine as provided in then-Section 605. The condemnee, although cognizant of both the taking and its property interests at stake, failed to challenge unity of purpose in timely preliminary objections. Under those circumstances, the Commonwealth Court held that the condemnee was required to file preliminary objections to the size of the property taken, demonstrating that un-condemned property should nonetheless be included. Accordingly, there, the court limited the evidence to the property plan and property plat filed by PennDOT and served on the condemnee.\n   <em>\n    West Whiteland\n   </em>\n   ,\n   <extracted-citation case-ids=\"11926460\" index=\"40\" url=\"https://cite.case.law/a2d/690/1266/\">\n    690 A.2d at 1271\n   </extracted-citation>\n   .\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-61\">\n   Here, PennDOT bore the burden of accurately notifying the owners of land subject to the taking so that they could protect their interests and secure just compensation.\n   <footnotemark>\n    11\n   </footnotemark>\n   Although harmless procedural irregularities \"will not set aside a condemnation decision,\"\n   <em>\n    Norberry One Condominium Association v.

Had PennDOT's declaration of taking informed the Szabos that the plan entailed utilizing portions of parcels 1 and 9, the Szabos reasonably might have been charged with recognizing sooner what only the commencement of construction ultimately revealed: that the plan did not accurately reflect the possible incursion upon their interests in the parcels designated 1 and 9, rendering PennDOT's proposed compensation insufficient.\n   <footnotemark>\n    2\n   </footnotemark>\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-69\">\n   Notably, PennDOT's own plan hinted at uncertainty regarding the relevant boundaries and titles to the three parcels at issue. As the Opinion Announcing the Judgment of the Court (\"OAJC\") relates, PennDOT acknowledged in its plan that the depicted boundaries separating the three parcels were \"probable [\n   <em>\n    sic\n   </em>\n   ] correct,\" that PennDOT had discovered errors in the chain of title, and that, despite these uncertainties, the lines \"were not surveyed by the professional land surveyor responsible for the project.\" OAJC at 54 (quoting Declaration of Taking Property Plan, 12/3/2012, at Sheet 1 of 2). As well, the plan did not indicate that, before PennDOT served notice of the condemnation of parcel 5 upon the Szabos, parcel 1 previously had been condemned by PennDOT, and Peters Township had sold parcel 9 to PennDOT in lieu of condemnation.\n   <em>\n    <extracted-citation case-ids=\"1406777\" index=\"44\" url=\"https://cite.case.law/pa-commw/135/113/\">\n     Id.\n    </extracted-citation>\n   </em>\n   <extracted-citation case-ids=\"1406777\" index=\"44\" url=\"https://cite.case.law/pa-commw/135/113/\">\n    at 54-55\n   </extracted-citation>\n   .\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-70\">\n   Under the Eminent Domain Code, 26 Pa.C.S. \u00a7\u00a7 101,\n   <em>\n    et seq.\n   </em>\n   (\"the Code\"), PennDOT bore the legal burden of informing the Szabos of the full scope of the taking of their property.\n   <em>\n    See\n   </em>\n   26 Pa.C.S. \u00a7 302(b) ;\n   <em>\n    see also\n   </em>\n   OAJC at 58-59. Given its acknowledged uncertainty regarding the property boundaries, PennDOT should have conducted a more penetrating investigation before filing the declaration. At a minimum, its plan should have indicated the full scope of the work upon all three parcels, if any, as a hedge against the plan's possibly flawed or inaccurate account of the three parcels' ownership. Instead, PennDOT served upon the Szabos a plan that informed them only of the portion of parcel 5 to be taken, leaving the Szabos no\n   reason to anticipate that portions of parcels 1 and 9 also would be taken. To deny the Szabos just compensation for the entirety of their interests subject to the taking as a consequence of PennDOT's errors or omissions would turn the statutory scheme on its head in derogation of the time-honored rigor we demand of condemnors in exercising their constitutionally circumscribed power of eminent domain.\n   <footnotemark>\n    3\n   </footnotemark>\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-71\">\n   I write separately because I believe that the OAJC's learned analysis identifies, but does not clearly resolve, irregularities in the case law under the Code that cannot be avoided in this case. The compensation issue here hinges upon a factual determination of the Szabos' property interest relative to PennDOT's taking. The Commonwealth Court has held generally that questions pertaining to the nature and scope of property to be taken must be adjudicated by the Court of Common Pleas upon the timely filing of preliminary objections to the declaration of taking, and that the failure to raise such questions in that pleading, within the time constraints that apply, will result in waiver.\n   <em>\n    See\n   </em>\n   <em>\n    West Whiteland Assoc. v.

However, the\n   <em>\n    relief\n   </em>\n   the Szabos seek, just compensation, is a matter excluded from the statutory procedure governing such preliminary objections. Instead, the power to determine compensation is delegated by statute in the first instance to a court-appointed board of viewers, and is subject to a distinct set of procedures under the Code. Further complicating matters, a board of viewers' jurisdiction is statutorily limited to assessing the value of a defined property interest that has been taken, and does not extend to fact-finding regarding the fact and extent of the taking itself.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-72\">\n   Commonwealth Court case law under the Code sets something of a trap for the unsuspecting condemnee proceeding in good faith. Where, as here, the condemnee is provided no reason to raise a frontal challenge to the declaration of taking, the condemnee has no statutory warrant for filing preliminary objections, even if the condemnee anticipates the possibility of a subsequent challenge to the compensation that the condemnor provides. However, taking certain Commonwealth Court cases at face value, should subsequent events call into question the fairness of the compensation provided, the condemnee will find the courthouse door closed if his claim for compensation is founded upon a discrepancy in the original declaration and plan that implicates questions of ownership.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-73\">\n   To cure this problem, we must look to the Eminent Domain Code, which by its terms \"provides a complete and exclusive procedure and law to govern all condemnations of property for public purposes and the assessment of damages.\" 26 Pa.C.S. \u00a7 102.

If an answer to those preliminary objections is filed and \"an issue of fact is raised,\n   <em>\n    the court shall conduct an evidentiary hearing or order that evidence be taken by deposition or otherwise, but in no event shall evidence be taken by the viewers on this issue\n   </em>\n   .\"\n   <em>\n    <extracted-citation index=\"60\" url=\"https://cite.case.law/citations/?q=390%20A.2d%201373\">\n     Id.\n    </extracted-citation>\n   </em>\n   \u00a7 504(d)(5) (emphasis added). Thus, a condemnor is entitled to challenge,\n   <em>\n    inter alia\n   </em>\n   , the factual underpinnings of a condemnee's claim for compensation only by preliminary objections to a petition for the appointment of viewers. Once the petition is granted-or after thirty days if no objections are filed-the party objecting to the appointment of viewers waives its opportunity to do so and there exists no express statutory basis for an evidentiary hearing.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-87\">\n   Conspicuously absent from these complementary provisions is a clear account of how to proceed under these circumstances. The plan provided to the Szabos allegedly misstated or omitted information critical to the Szabos' understanding of the property subject to the taking, principally by omitting any illustration of the effect of the intended construction upon parcels 1 and 9. Thus, without any reason to suspect that PennDOT's plans implicated interests beyond those designated on the plan with respect to parcel 5, the Szabos did not file preliminary objections, leaving them only the option to challenge the compensation for the property\n   <em>\n    as delineated in the plan\n   </em>\n   . In due course, the Szabos filed a petition for the appointment of viewers. However, in that petition, which evidently was filed before PennDOT commenced construction, the Szabos made no mention of any interests outside parcel 5. When construction activities raised questions regarding their possible interests in parcels 1 and 9, the Szabos promptly filed a petition for an evidentiary hearing to address those questions.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-88\">\n   Although the OAJC admirably seeks to reconcile available Commonwealth Court case law with the Code, I am unpersuaded. While the Code's structure suggests that the form of relief sought should dictate the procedure utilized, the case law more clearly focuses upon the basis upon which relief is sought. The Code plainly distinguishes\n   structurally and by its terms between challenges seeking reversal of a condemnation and \"issues of compensation.\"\n   <em>\n    Compare\n   </em>\n   <em>\n    id\n   </em>\n   . \u00a7\u00a7 306(a)(3)(i)-(iv)\n   <em>\n    with\n   </em>\n   <em>\n    id\n   </em>\n   . \u00a7 306(b). Notably, the chapter pertaining to each provides a distinct process for addressing factual issues that arise in resolving the respective challenges. In each chapter, fact-finding is entrusted to the Court of Common Pleas. The board of viewers, vested only with authority to calculate compensation, expressly is precluded from addressing issues of fact that arise in connection with that inquiry. 26 Pa.C.S. \u00a7 504(d)(5).\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-89\">\n   The distinction between these two functions comports with the policy reflected in the Code, which seeks to balance the condemnor's authority to take land expeditiously for the public good against the property owner's right to just compensation. In furtherance of these goals, the Code requires a condemnee to raise any direct challenge to a condemnation within thirty days of notice via preliminary objections, ensuring expeditious determination of the condemnor's right to title. However, the Code provides a separate framework for a condemnee to challenge the amount of just compensation without the strictures of a compressed time period. In this way, the Code balances expeditiousness in the transfer of title where it serves the public interest with an adequate process for determining just compensation for landowners who are deprived of their property rights. Thus, the form of relief, rather than the particular factual or legal predicates upon which relief is sought, must dictate the procedure.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-90\">\n   This analysis is in tension with the trial court's and PennDOT's reliance upon\n   <em>\n    West Whiteland\n   </em>\n   . At issue in that case was the condemnee's desire to apply the unity of purpose doctrine, which provided that, \"[w]here all or a part of several contiguous tracts owned by one owner is condemned or a part of several non-contiguous tracts owned by one owner which are used for a unified purpose is condemned, damages shall be assessed as if such tracts were one parcel.\" 26 P.S. \u00a7 1-605 (repealed).\n   <footnotemark>\n    6\n   </footnotemark>\n   PennDOT filed a declaration of taking indicating its intention to condemn approximately twenty-four acres of a seventy-one-acre parcel owned by the condemnee, leaving the condemnee approximately forty-seven acres. The condemnee did not file preliminary objections to the declaration. Several years later, condemnee filed a timely petition for the appointment of viewers, wherein condemnee requested additional compensation, but did not suggest any dispute regarding the size of the affected parcel. However, before the board of viewers, condemnee's witnesses testified that the size of the relevant property prior to the taking in fact comprised 179 acres, based upon the unity of purpose doctrine, and sought on that basis to modify compensation in condemnee's favor.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-91\">\n   PennDOT argued that condemnee should have raised the unity of purpose doctrine in preliminary objections to the declaration, because it implicated the nature of the property subject to the taking. Thus, PennDOT argued, the condemnee's invocation of the doctrine was untimely and waived. The Commonwealth Court agreed, quoting its earlier decision in\n   <em>\n    Appeal of Bernstein\n   </em>\n   for the proposition that \"the nature of the property interest a party possesses, if any, in an eminent domain proceeding is properly raised by preliminary objections, and the failure to raise the issue by means of preliminary objections constitutes a waiver of such issues.\"\n   <em>\n    West Whiteland Assocs.\n   </em>\n   ,\n   <extracted-citation case-ids=\"11926460\" index=\"61\" url=\"https://cite.case.law/a2d/690/1266/\">\n    690 A.2d at 1269\n   </extracted-citation>\n   (quoting\n   <em>\n    Appeal of Bernstein\n   </em>\n   ,\n   <extracted-citation case-ids=\"1368055\" index=\"62\" url=\"https://cite.case.law/pa-commw/112/368/#p1214\">\n    535 A.2d at\n   </extracted-citation>\n   1214 ).\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-92\">\n   Thus, notwithstanding that condemnee's claims pertained\n   <em>\n    only\n   </em>\n   to just compensation, the court effectively held that any property-related concerns that might later inform a compensation claim must be raised in preliminary objections to the declaration, even though a court hearing such objections may not consider questions of compensation.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-93\">\n   Notably, while it has never expressly embraced the remedy-dictates-procedure approach that I believe best reflects the legislative intent reflected in the Code, this Court nonetheless has leaned toward it, and it did so in a case that postdates\n   <em>\n    West Whiteland\n   </em>\n   by over fifteen years.

Despite the frontage, Sluciak did not have his own driveway; instead, he accessed the main road by using a driveway running over the corner of his neighbor's adjacent property. Seeking to expand an interstate on-ramp, PennDOT filed a declaration condemning all of Sluciak's property fronting the road. Sluciak did not file preliminary objections to the declaration of taking. PennDOT provided compensation as required, but Sluciak petitioned the court to appoint viewers, arguing that the compensation was insufficient because the taking landlocked his property. The board of viewers found that Sluciak's property was not landlocked because he held an easement by necessity in his neighbor's driveway, and the board upheld the compensation provided.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-94\">\n   Sluciak appealed the board's decision to the Court of Common Pleas. PennDOT moved to dismiss Sluciak's appeal on the basis that Sluciak had waived his claims because he had not raised the landlocking and access issues in preliminary objections to the declaration of taking. The court denied the motion to dismiss, but ultimately agreed with the viewers that Sluciak's property was not landlocked and set a date for a jury trial as to damages. Sluciak appealed. Again, PennDOT argued waiver, but the Commonwealth Court held that Sluciak had not waived his request for additional compensation by failing to raise it by preliminary objection. The Commonwealth Court also ruled in Sluciak's favor on the merits, and PennDOT sought allowance of appeal in this Court, which we granted.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-95\">\n   In again pressing its waiver argument, PennDOT relied upon the Commonwealth Court's ruling in\n   <em>\n    West Whiteland\n   </em>\n   , which it argued compelled the conclusion that, because Sluciak's challenge depended on the property interests taken, it amounted to a challenge to the declaration of taking, which he failed to raise by preliminary objection. Sluciak disagreed, arguing that, because he sought to challenge the compensation, he neither was obligated nor permitted to raise his claim in preliminary objections.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-96\">\n   This Court agreed generally that \"[p]reliminary objections under ... the Code are intended as a procedure to resolve expeditiously all legal and factual challenges to the declaration of taking,\"\n   <em>\n    Sluciak\n   </em>\n   ,\n   <extracted-citation case-ids=\"163549,163616,9434973,9434925\" index=\"65\" url=\"https://cite.case.law/a2d/798/725/\">\n    798 A.2d at 731\n   </extracted-citation>\n   . However, the Court nonetheless rejected PennDOT's waiver argument because Sluciak's \"claim went to the value of his remaining property after the condemnation.\"\n   <em>\n    <extracted-citation case-ids=\"163549,163616,9434973,9434925\" index=\"66\" url=\"https://cite.case.law/a2d/798/725/\">\n     Id.\n    </extracted-citation>\n   </em>\n   <extracted-citation case-ids=\"163549,163616,9434973,9434925\" index=\"66\" url=\"https://cite.case.law/a2d/798/725/\">\n    at 732\n   </extracted-citation>\n   . Specifically, Sluciak contended that the value of his remaining property was diminished due to a lack of legal access to the road.

In so doing, PennDOT effectively insists that the predicate for relief sought, rather than the nature of that relief, determines when a condemnee must raise a challenge, on peril of waiver.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-98\">\n   The OAJC rejects PennDOT's reliance upon\n   <em>\n    West Whiteland\n   </em>\n   by attempting to distinguish it from the instant case. The OAJC observes that, in\n   <em>\n    West Whiteland\n   </em>\n   , the condemnee undisputedly knew all of the information necessary to seek application of the unity of purpose doctrine within the time allotted for preliminary objections to the declaration. OAJC at 64. While the Szabos seek relief specifically due to a deficiency in the declaration, in\n   <em>\n    West Whiteland\n   </em>\n   PennDOT undisputedly had accurately described the parcel, and the portion thereof, that it sought to condemn. Thus, the OAJC concludes that the condemnee in\n   <em>\n    West Whiteland\n   </em>\n   was not similarly situated to the Szabos in this case, where their core contention is that the declaration did\n   <em>\n    not\n   </em>\n   give them all of the information they required to understand the full effect of the intended taking. In my view, while this distinction has some superficial appeal, it ultimately lacks any material difference.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-99\">\n   In both cases, the condemnee effectively accepted the\n   <em>\n    fact\n   </em>\n   of the taking, and acceded to PennDOT's authority to effectuate it. Thus, neither party objected to the validity of the taking or the vesting of title in PennDOT, which are the proper subjects of preliminary objections to the declaration, as noted in\n   <em>\n    Sluciak\n   </em>\n   . Rather, in each case, the condemnee raised matters ancillary to the taking solely in connection with calculating compensation. I discern no statutory basis to suggest that the mere ability to identify compensation-related questions during the short time period for objecting to the taking is dispositive of whether the condemnee must raise (or is even permitted by statute to raise) such questions in a context reserved for challenges to the taking\n   <em>\n    itself\n   </em>\n   .\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-100\">\n   Moreover, it is not at all clear to me that the OAJC's attempt to distinguish\n   <em>\n    West Whiteland\n   </em>\n   can be reconciled with our later decision in\n   <em>\n    Sluciak\n   </em>\n   . The facts in\n   <em>\n    Sluciak\n   </em>\n   strike me as more consistent with\n   <em>\n    West Whiteland\n   </em>\n   than with this case. In\n   <em>\n    Sluciak\n   </em>\n   , as in\n   <em>\n    West Whiteland\n   </em>\n   , the condemnee possessed all of the information at the time of the taking that he later relied upon in seeking to modify compensation. The property lines, the extent of the taking, even the long-standing utilization of the neighbor's driveway, all were within the condemnee's knowledge when the declaration of taking was served. Ultimately, we rejected waiver not because some critical fact had been omitted or was unavailable at the time of the declaration, but rather because the question of legal access was of concern solely for purposes of valuing the condemnee's remaining property, and therefore was \"not a matter that ... must be raised by preliminary objections.\"\n   <em>\n    Sluciak\n   </em>\n   ,\n   <extracted-citation case-ids=\"163549,163616,9434973,9434925\" index=\"68\" url=\"https://cite.case.law/a2d/798/725/\">\n    798 A.2d at 732\n   </extracted-citation>\n   . While it did not do so explicitly, I believe that\n   <em>\n    Sluciak\n   </em>\n   effectively abrogated\n   <em>\n    West Whiteland\n   </em>\n   , at least to the extent that\n   <em>\n    West Whiteland\n   </em>\n   can be read to require that title and use-related questions that are raised solely in connection with determining just compensation nonetheless must be raised in the first instance in preliminary objections to the declaration of taking.\n   <footnotemark>\n    7\n   </footnotemark>\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-101\">\n   Realizing belatedly that they had failed to apprehend the full effect of PennDOT's taking, the Szabos chose the best of only bad options. Presumably recognizing that their issues concerning the imposition upon their interests in parcels 1 and 9 entailed factual claims that PennDOT would dispute, they did not ask the viewers to answer those questions. Instead, they filed a petition for an evidentiary hearing before the Common Pleas Court. This necessarily improvisational step did not depart substantially in effect from a hypothetical scenario in which they discovered the issue with parcels 1 and 9 before filing their petition for the appointment of viewers and included in their petition factual assertions about PennDOT's incursions upon interests not delineated. PennDOT then would have been on notice of the factual claims and could have filed preliminary objections to that petition pursuant to 26 Pa.C.S. \u00a7 504(d). At that point, or upon the Szabos' filing of an answer to the preliminary objections, the dispute would have come to the fore and the Court of Common Pleas would have stepped in to resolve the issue, as anticipated in Chapter 5 of the Code.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-102\">\n   The fact remains that the Szabos seek not to adjudicate title or the validity of the taking, properly the province of Chapter 3 of the Code, but only to challenge the compensation for the property interests that PennDOT actually took, which is governed by Chapter 5. For that reason alone, I agree with the OAJC that the Szabos are entitled to a judicial determination by the Common Pleas Court concerning the nature and scope of PennDOT's taking. However, I disagree that our holding in that regard can be reconciled with\n   <em>\n    West Whiteland\n   </em>\n   .\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-103\">\n   Finally, while affirming the Commonwealth Court's decision in substantial part, the OAJC elaborates on, or perhaps departs from, the Commonwealth Court's proposed disposition. While the Commonwealth Court remanded with instructions to the trial court \"for an evidentiary hearing consistent with this opinion,\" it left unclear whether it intended that the trial court thereafter assess compensation in the first instance or that the trial court, upon completion of the evidentiary hearing, relinquish the matter to the board of viewers for the determination of compensation in light of its findings.\n   <em>\n    Szabo v.

Cmwlth. 2017). Clarifying that the Common Pleas Court, upon completion of the evidentiary hearing, should pass the case to the board of viewers to determine just compensation, the OAJC's mandate is most consistent with the Code's intended procedure.\n   <em>\n    See\n   </em>\n   OAJC at 64.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-104\">\n   Case law provides scant guidance in this regard, but what there is, viewed in light of the Code's design, supports the OAJC's approach. In\n   <em>\n    Millcreek Twp. v. N.E.A. Cross Co.\n   </em>\n   , 152 Pa.Cmwlth. 576,\n   <extracted-citation case-ids=\"1439889\" index=\"70\" url=\"https://cite.case.law/pa-commw/152/576/\">\n    620 A.2d 558\n   </extracted-citation>\n   (1993), the Commonwealth Court considered an alleged\n   <em>\n    de facto\n   </em>\n   taking. When such a claim is raised in a petition for the appointment of viewers and disputed by preliminary objections, a dispute concerning the fact and scope of the infringement arises, which by statute must be resolved by the Court of Common Pleas. 26 Pa.C.S. \u00a7 504(d)(5). The\n   <em>\n    Millcreek\n   </em>\n   court explained that, if the court determines that a\n   <em>\n    de facto\n   </em>\n   taking has occurred, \"the case is then sent to a board of viewers to determine damages.\"\n   <em>\n    Millcreek\n   </em>\n   ,\n   <extracted-citation case-ids=\"1439889\" index=\"71\" url=\"https://cite.case.law/pa-commw/152/576/\">\n    620 A.2d at\n   </extracted-citation>\n   560 (citing\n   <em>\n    In re Ramsey\n   </em>\n   , 31 Pa.Cmwlth. 182,\n   <extracted-citation index=\"72\" url=\"https://cite.case.law/citations/?q=375%20A.2d%20886\">\n    375 A.2d 886\n   </extracted-citation>\n   (1977) ).\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-105\">\n   In this case, the parties dispute that the declaration and plan that PennDOT provided the Szabos contained any errors pertaining to ownership or the relevant scope of the project.

Indeed, in order to consider excusing their failure to file preliminary objections to the declaration of taking, one must either presume their ignorance of ownership of parcels 1 and 9, or their ignorance of the boundaries of parcel 5, because the maps attached to the declaration of taking clearly set forth the boundaries of all three properties, identified Szabos as the owners of parcel 5 only, and identified other individuals and entities as the owners of parcels 1 and 9. Of course, given what the maps revealed, if one presumes Szabos knew what they owned and knew the boundaries of their land, which they now claim includes all of parcels 1, 5 and 9, then their failure to file preliminary objections to the alleged inaccuracies is easily seen as a failure on their part to inspect adequately the declaration of taking and its attachments.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-111\">\n   From the record, including Szabos' submissions to the lower courts and this Court, it is impossible to tell whether Szabos knew what they owned when the declaration of taking was filed.\n   <footnotemark>\n    1\n   </footnotemark>\n   It is my view,\n   if Szabos knew what they owned, then the notice provided was clearly adequate to alert them to file preliminary objections and their subsequent attempt to challenge the extent and effect of the taking was properly deemed waived by the trial court. Moreover, if Szabos knew what they owned, the Commonwealth Court's determination Szabos received insufficient notice would be error, because the notice they received explicitly indicated they did not own parcels 1 and 9. Conversely, if Szabos did not know what they owned, when confronted with a declaration of taking, it was incumbent upon them to take immediate action to determine precisely what they owned in order to preserve their property interests.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-112\">\n   Nevertheless, Justice Mundy, in the Opinion Announcing the Judgment of the Court (OAJC), determines notice to Szabos was deficient, given the fundamental protections of a person's property enumerated under our Constitution, and the fact the maps and declaration of taking did not state that parcels 1 and 9 were to be\n   <strong>\n    condemned\n   </strong>\n   . I am constrained to disagree, in part because I question whether appellant (PennDOT) was required to give Szabos notice of the condemnation of an adjacent property owner's parcel. Also, I believe the law recognizes the existence of potential prejudice to the Commonwealth and its taxpayers if any dispute as to the size of the property to be condemned is not raised by the condemnee at the time of the condemnation. Here, by the time Szabos made any objection, they had already accepted $ 587,000 estimated just compensation for parcel 5, PennDot had secured use of parcels 1 and 9 from the owners of record, and construction work had already begun. This is precisely the type of prejudice to the condemnor that can arise when the size of the property condemned is not challenged by the condemnee at the outset of proceedings.\n   <em>\n    See\n   </em>\n   26 Pa.C.S. \u00a7 306(a) (preliminary objections filed within 30 days after being served with notice of condemnation shall be exclusive method of challenging the declaration);\n   <em>\n    see also\n   </em>\n   26 Pa.C.S. \u00a7 307(c)(3) (\"In no event shall the condemnee be compelled to pay back to the condemnor the [estimated just] compensation paid [to condemnee]..., even if the amount of just compensation as finally determined is less than the compensation paid.\");\n   <em>\n    West Whiteland Assocs. v.

In\n   <em>\n    West Whiteland\n   </em>\n   , PennDOT filed a declaration of taking in June 1989 that included a plot plan and property plat showing property consisting of 71.526 acres before condemnation and 23.866 acres after the taking. The condemnee did not file preliminary objections. Almost four years later, the condemnee petitioned for the appointment of a board of viewers, and requested additional compensation based on the allegation that his property before the taking actually consisted of 179 acres. PennDOT\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-114\">\n   argued that because the condemnee failed to file preliminary objections pursuant to Section 406(a) of the former Code, 26 P.S. \u00a7 1-406 (repealed),\n   <footnotemark>\n    2\n   </footnotemark>\n   condemnee had waived the right to raise this claim.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-115\">\n   The Commonwealth Court agreed.

The court concluded the issue condemnee sought to contest,\n   <em>\n    i.e.\n   </em>\n   , \"the size of [c]ondemnee's entire property,\" related to \"information that must be included in the declaration of taking and notice of condemnation,\" and was so basic to the case that it had to be decided at the earliest possible stage by the filing of preliminary objections.\n   <em>\n    Id.\n   </em>\n   at 1269.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-117\">\n   In my view,\n   <em>\n    West Whiteland\n   </em>\n   is instructive for the present case and supports PennDOT's position. Here, Szabos did not file preliminary objections to the declaration of taking, but years later claimed they actually owned parcel 5 and parcels 1 and 9 despite the plot plans and maps attached to the declaration of taking clearly listing parcels 1 and 9 as being owned by other entities. As previously explained, plot plans are essentially the heart of a declaration of taking. Because the plot plans set forth the boundaries of parcels 1, 5 and 9, explained how the boundaries were drawn, and identified other parties as the owners of parcels 1 and 9, the trial court correctly determined Szabos were placed on notice of any alleged error long before amorphous circumstances prodded them to hire a surveyor and file their petition for evidentiary hearing in May 2015.\n   <em>\n    See\n   </em>\n   Tr. Ct. Op. at 4 (\"Szabos knew precisely what property was being taken[.]\").\n   <footnotemark>\n    3\n   </footnotemark>\n   The disclosures\n   in the plans, together with the notice accompanying PennDOT's declaration which advised Szabos of a thirty-day time frame within which to object, were sufficient to put Szabos on notice of what property was being taken and condemned, even if they actually did not know the extent and boundaries of their land. Szabos were clearly on notice further timely investigation would be required to support preliminary objections in the event they disagreed with PennDOT's information.\n   <footnotemark>\n    4\n   </footnotemark>\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-118\">\n   I also question the OAJC's determination PennDOT did not adequately identify the extent or effect of the taking. Szabos have maintained throughout all phases of this litigation that they did not waive their challenge by failing to file preliminary objections. Szabos argue an exception to waiver exists where the declaration of taking fails to adequately establish the extent or effect of the taking such that the condemnation amounts to a\n   <em>\n    de facto\n   </em>\n   taking. Although the OAJC acknowledges this argument, and ultimately accepts Szabos' view the declaration failed to establish the extent or effect of the taking, the OAJC does not expressly conclude a\n   <em>\n    de facto\n   </em>\n   taking occurred here. I would squarely address the issue, and determine there was no\n   <em>\n    de facto\n   </em>\n   taking which would excuse the failure to file preliminary objections.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-119\">\n   With respect to this issue, PennDOT asserts the declaration of taking in this case adequately established the extent and effect of the taking. It asserts a\n   <em>\n    de facto\n   </em>\n   taking - for purposes of excusing the requirement of preliminary objections - occurs only when a condemnee could not have known that ownership interests in additional property unidentified in the declaration will be negatively affected. PennDOT distinguishes this case from the facts presented in\n   <em>\n    In re Commonwealth Dep't of Gen. Servs.\n   </em>\n   ,\n   <extracted-citation case-ids=\"11720041\" index=\"89\" url=\"https://cite.case.law/a2d/714/1159/\">\n    714 A.2d 1159\n   </extracted-citation>\n   (Pa.

PennDOT asserts both\n   <em>\n    Greenfield Twp.\n   </em>\n   and\n   <em>\n    Dep't Gen. Servs.\n   </em>\n   involved allegations of a taking \"beyond what was stated in the declaration of taking's description of property condemned and associated plans.\" Appellant's Brief at 21.

PennDOT accordingly asserts \"the exceptions in these cases [ (\n   <em>\n    Greenfield Twp.\n   </em>\n   <em>\n    and\n   </em>\n   <em>\n    Dep't Gen. Servs.\n   </em>\n   ) ] do not apply to this case, and therefore, do not excuse Szabos from filing preliminary objections to the declaration of taking pursuant to Section 306 of the Eminent Domain Code.\"\n   <em>\n    Id.\n   </em>\n   at 20.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-120\">\n   I would first note, despite this Court's express inclusion of the citation to both cases in the second question upon which we granted review, Szabos do not cite to or discuss\n   <em>\n    Dep't Gen. Servs.\n   </em>\n   at all, and only briefly assert the holding in\n   <em>\n    Greenfield Twp.\n   </em>\n   \"is on all fours\" with the facts of the present case.\n   <em>\n    Id.\n   </em>\n   at 27. In short, Szabos' position is that because they did not know parcels 1 and 9 were to be condemned when the declaration of taking was filed on January 10, 2013, the PennDOT activity on parcels 1 and 9 in 2015 amounted to a\n   <em>\n    de facto\n   </em>\n   taking which excused their failure to file preliminary objections. I reiterate that the record makes clear Szabos had actual notice the declaration of taking listed other persons and entities as the record owners of parcels 1 and 9 triggering the requirement to file preliminary objections if they disagreed with the plans.\n   <em>\n    See\n   </em>\n   <em>\n    supra\n   </em>\n   at 74-76. I would expressly analyze whether the actual taking of parcels 1 &amp; 9 for the purposes of the highway widening and improvement project was a\n   <em>\n    de facto\n   </em>\n   taking of Szabos' property that could not have been foreseen, thus excusing their failure to file preliminary objections. I would conclude there was no\n   <em>\n    de facto\n   </em>\n   taking.\n   <footnotemark>\n    5\n   </footnotemark>\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-121\">\n   \"[A]\n   <em>\n    de facto\n   </em>\n   taking occurs when an entity clothed with the power of eminent domain substantially deprives an owner of the beneficial use and enjoyment of his property.\"\n   <em>\n    In re De Facto Condemnation &amp; Taking of Lands of WBF Assocs.\n   </em>\n   ,\n   <em>\n    L.P.\n   </em>\n   ,\n   <extracted-citation case-ids=\"3788381\" index=\"91\" url=\"https://cite.case.law/pa/588/242/\">\n    588 Pa. 242\n   </extracted-citation>\n   ,\n   <extracted-citation case-ids=\"8411032,3788381\" index=\"92\" url=\"https://cite.case.law/a2d/903/1192/\">\n    903 A.2d 1192\n   </extracted-citation>\n   , 1199 (2006).\n   <em>\n    See also\n   </em>\n   <em>\n    Appeal of D.R.E.

The trial court denied DGS's preliminary objections following submission of briefs and oral argument.\n   <em>\n    <extracted-citation case-ids=\"11720041\" index=\"110\" url=\"https://cite.case.law/a2d/714/1159/\">\n     Id.\n    </extracted-citation>\n   </em>\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-127\">\n   On appeal, DGS argued\n   <em>\n    , inter alia\n   </em>\n   , that Curry waived the issue of a\n   <em>\n    de facto\n   </em>\n   taking by failing to raise the issue in preliminary objections to the declaration of taking. The panel relied on\n   <em>\n    Greenfield Twp.\n   </em>\n   to reject that argument by DGS, and determined \"[t]he record here supports the conclusion that the [d]eclaration of [t]aking did not adequately establish the extent or effect of the taking. Therefore, this issue is not waived.\"\n   <em>\n    <extracted-citation case-ids=\"11720041\" index=\"111\" url=\"https://cite.case.law/a2d/714/1159/\">\n     Id.\n    </extracted-citation>\n   </em>\n   <extracted-citation case-ids=\"11720041\" index=\"111\" url=\"https://cite.case.law/a2d/714/1159/\">\n    at 1162\n   </extracted-citation>\n   .\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-128\">\n   As\n   <em>\n    Greenfield Twp.\n   </em>\n   and\n   <em>\n    Dep't Gen. Servs.\n   </em>\n   demonstrate, Pennsylvania jurisprudence recognizes a\n   <em>\n    de facto\n   </em>\n   taking occurs when there has been a substantial deprivation of a party's use of his or her land even though there has been no physical intrusion upon it. The Commonwealth Court has confirmed, \"[t]he theory of\n   <em>\n    de facto\n   </em>\n   taking has been developed in response to\" circumstances in which a government improvement project may \"so substantially interfere with one's use and enjoyment of his property as to inflict a compensable injury ... even though the power of eminent domain has not been formally exercised against the property in question and there has been no physical intrusion of it.\"\n   <em>\n    Filbert Ltd. Partnership Appeal\n   </em>\n   , 64 Pa.Cmwlth. 605,\n   <extracted-citation index=\"112\" url=\"https://cite.case.law/citations/?q=441%20A.2d%201345\">\n    441 A.2d 1345\n   </extracted-citation>\n   , 1352 (1982). This principle is illustrated in\n   <em>\n    Greenfield Twp.\n   </em>\n   , where there had been no physical intrusion upon the southern portion of DeMarcos' property. Instead, that portion had become landlocked, and thus unusable, due to the roadway construction project that took place on the condemned portion of DeMarcos' property, resulting in a\n   <em>\n    de facto\n   </em>\n   taking.\n   <em>\n    Greenfield Twp.\n   </em>\n   ,\n   <extracted-citation case-ids=\"1406777\" index=\"113\" url=\"https://cite.case.law/pa-commw/135/113/\">\n    582 A.2d at 44\n   </extracted-citation>\n   . Similarly, in\n   <em>\n    Dep't Gen. Servs.\n   </em>\n   , even though there had been no physical intrusion, Curry lost access to timber and riparian rights on its property adjacent to the condemned property upon which the hike/bike trail had been constructed, and thus, the court determined there were sufficient facts of a\n   <em>\n    de facto\n   </em>\n   taking of the adjacent property to warrant an evidentiary hearing on the matter, despite the failure to file preliminary objections.\n   <em>\n    Dep't Gen. Servs.\n   </em>\n   ,\n   <extracted-citation case-ids=\"11720041\" index=\"114\" url=\"https://cite.case.law/a2d/714/1159/\">\n    714 A.2d at 1162\n   </extracted-citation>\n   . Importantly, in both cases, the extent and effect of the taking were not known, in part, because condemnees were unaware at the time their property was condemned that unintended consequences affecting their rights would follow.\n   <em>\n    <extracted-citation case-ids=\"11720041\" index=\"115\" url=\"https://cite.case.law/a2d/714/1159/\">\n     Id.\n    </extracted-citation>\n   </em>\n   ,\n   <em>\n    discussing generally\n   </em>\n   <em>\n    Greenfield Twp.\n   </em>\n   ,\n   <extracted-citation case-ids=\"1406777\" index=\"116\" url=\"https://cite.case.law/pa-commw/135/113/\">\n    582 A.2d 41\n   </extracted-citation>\n   .\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-129\">\n   With these principles in mind, I observe there was an actual intrusion upon parcels 1 and 9 by the condemnor here: PennDOT took direct, observable occupation of the land via physical construction and widening of the roadway as part of its condemnation and\n   <em>\n    de jure\n   </em>\n   taking of those parcels from persons and entities other than Szabos. Szabos seek to convert PennDOT's plainly\n   <em>\n    de jure\n   </em>\n   taking of parcels 1 &amp; 9 (from the owners of record as set forth on the plans contained in the declaration of taking for parcel 5) into a\n   <em>\n    de facto\n   </em>\n   taking of parcels 1 &amp; 9 from themselves, in order to excuse their failure to file preliminary objections to the declaration of taking. Szabos ask us to conclude the taking was\n   <em>\n    de facto\n   </em>\n   with respect to them in part because they allegedly did not know in January 2013 that parcels 1 &amp; 9 had been condemned, and because they did not know at that time the roadway construction would even impact parcels 1 &amp; 9.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-130\">\n   I would conclude Szabos' arguments in this regard are unavailing. Indeed, Szabos' assertion the plans attached to PennDOT's declaration of taking did not indicate parcels 1 and 9 were related to or a part of the\n   <em>\n    de jure\n   </em>\n   condemnation of parcel 5 is misleading. First, my review of the plans attached to the declaration show parcels 1 and 9 are in closest proximity to the site of the planned construction. Any careful review of the plans would lead a reasonable person to conclude, particularly one in purported possession of the land, the greatest effect of the proposed construction would occur on parcels 1 and 9. Second, despite their arguments to the contrary, Szabos appear to acknowledge they understood parcels 1 and 9 would be condemned in addition to parcel 5. Tellingly, their brief states, \"A party is not required to assert ownership to condemned property by filing preliminary objections when the declaration of taking says the property condemned is owned by another.\"\n   <em>\n    Id.\n   </em>\n   at 11. Under the facts of this case, I would conclude there was no\n   <em>\n    de facto\n   </em>\n   taking as the plans and attachments adequately revealed the effect and extent of the taking such that there were no unanticipated consequences of PennDOT's proposed condemnation. I would decline to expand the range of circumstances establishing a\n   <em>\n    de facto\n   </em>\n   taking to include unsubstantiated averments of mistake on the face of plans attached to a declaration of taking which clearly set forth the parcels, their owners, their boundaries, and explained underlying distance errors and anomalies in the chain of title upon which the plans are drawn.\n   <footnotemark>\n    6\n   </footnotemark>\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-131\">\n   Moreover, it is clear the size of the condemned property is a basic and fundamental aspect of a taking that must be finally determined at the earliest opportunity. Thus, in my view, it is incumbent upon the condemnee to investigate further and, if in disagreement with the plans attached to the declaration of taking, to file timely preliminary objections. 26 Pa.C.S. \u00a7 306(a).\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-132\">\n   Accordingly, I respectfully dissent.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-133\">\n   Justice Donohue joins this dissenting opinion.\n  </p>\n  <footnote label=\"1\">\n   <p id=\"p-181\">\n    <em>\n     See\n    </em>\n    PA.
