They are the very means by which we live out our creed to \"promote the general Welfare, and secure the Blessings of Liberty to ourselves and our Posterity.\" U.S. Const. pmbl. To discontinue such aid is no small matter and has consequences well beyond the single individual for whom the assistance has been terminated. In this case, we evaluate housing voucher termination procedures and consider whether they are both adequately protective of public housing voucher recipients and limitedly burdensome on public housing officials.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-11\">\n   Today we resolve two questions:\n   <footnotemark>\n    1\n   </footnotemark>\n   (1) whether Respondent Harford County Housing Agency (\"HCHA\") terminated Petitioner Karen McDonell's voucher without affording appropriate procedures under Maryland law and the United States Constitution; and (2) whether the HCHA's decision to terminate McDonell's voucher was supported by substantial evidence in the record.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-12\">\n   We shall hold that the HCHA complied with procedural due process, that Maryland law required no additional process, and that the record contained substantial evidence.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-13\">\n   <strong>\n    BACKGROUND\n   </strong>\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-14\">\n   <em>\n    Factual Overview and Procedural Posture\n   </em>\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-15\">\n   On November 4, 2011, Karen McDonell was enrolled in the Housing Choice Voucher Program (\"HCVP\" or \"Voucher Program,\" but commonly \"Section 8\"). The HCVP is a federally-funded housing assistance program, administered by the HCHA\n   <footnotemark>\n    2\n   </footnotemark>\n   in Harford County, Maryland. Families enrolled in the HCVP must abide by a set of guidelines, explained in detail below, or risk termination of their monthly rental assistance.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-16\">\n   McDonell participated in the Voucher Program without issue for more than three years. In February 2015, she fell behind on her obligation to reimburse the HCHA for an overpayment and entered into a Restitution Agreement. Under the agreement, she was required to make monthly payments of $42.22. The amount of the payments was ultimately lowered because McDonell struggled to afford the first-prescribed amount. Even so, she failed to make payments in August and September of 2015.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-17\">\n   In June 2015, McDonell was involved in an altercation involving her sister, a neighbor, and the neighbor's daughter. McDonell\n   was found guilty on two counts of second-degree assault and was incarcerated at the Harford County Detention Center. While McDonell was incarcerated, her mother twice informed the HCHA that McDonell and her family were not residing in the home: once on October 1 and once on an unknown date. During her incarceration, McDonell was allegedly denied access to her medication, and consequently, fell into a diabetic coma and was taken to Upper Chesapeake Medical Center. The HCHA was made aware of this.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-18\">\n   McDonell was released from jail on October 15, 2015. Days after her release, McDonell's unit failed a Housing Quality Inspection due to a rodent infestation, and she was ordered to\n   make repairs by November 10. But on November 10, McDonell was not present at the home for the reinspection.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-19\">\n   On November 30, 2015, the HCHA sent McDonell a letter notifying her that her Housing Voucher was being terminated for the following reasons:\n  </p>\n  <blockquote id=\"p-20\">\n   1. Failure to provide access to your unit for the required Housing Quality Standard (HQS) Inspection scheduled for November 10, 2015.\n  </blockquote>\n  <blockquote id=\"p-21\">\n   2. Failure to notify the Housing Agency that your family was not residing in the assisted unit. (According to the Maryland Judiciary Case Search, you were incarcerated from September 8, 2015, through October 14, 2015.)\n  </blockquote>\n  <blockquote id=\"p-22\">\n   3. On June 9, 2015, you were charged with two counts of Second Degree Assault in the District Court for Harford County. On September 8, 2015, the District Court of Harford County listed the disposition for both charges as guilty.\n  </blockquote>\n  <blockquote id=\"p-23\">\n   4. Failure to pay restitution to the Housing Agency in accordance with the restitution agreement you signed on February 5, 2015. The last payment made on your accoun[t] was October 19, 2015.\n  </blockquote>\n  <p id=\"p-24\">\n   The letter also advised McDonell that her housing assistance would terminate December 31, 2015 and that she had the right to request an informal hearing within 14 days. McDonell requested an informal hearing, which was held on December 21, 2015. The Hearing Officer (\"HO\") issued a decision upholding the termination on January 6, 2016, which is excerpted at length below.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-25\">\n   McDonell sought judicial review in the Circuit Court for Harford County. McDonell argued that: the hearing was \"unfair,\" she never received notice of the reinspection, her mother promptly notified the HCHA of McDonell's incarceration, she was \"caught up\" on her restitution payments, and she was \"falsely\" charged with two counts of second-degree assault. The Circuit Court determined that the record contained substantial evidence to justify the HCHA's decision to terminate\n   McDonell's voucher. The judge upheld the termination on all four grounds listed in the notice.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-26\">\n   In an unreported decision, the Court of Special Appeals affirmed the decision of both the Circuit Court and the HO. While finding the due process issues unpreserved, the intermediate appellate court went on to hold that, even if the issue was properly before it, \"the Housing Agency did not violate appellant's due process rights.\" It also held that \"the [HCHA's] decision to terminate appellant's Housing Vouchers was supported by substantial evidence in the record and not premised upon an erroneous legal conclusion.\"\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-27\">\n   <em>\n    HUD Regulations and the Informal Hearing Procedure\n   </em>\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-28\">\n   Congress established the HCVP with the express purpose of \"promot[ing] the\n   general welfare of the Nation ....\"\n   <extracted-citation index=\"3\" url=\"https://cite.case.law/citations/?q=42%20U.S.C.%20%C2%A7%201437\">\n    42 U.S.C. \u00a7 1437\n   </extracted-citation>\n   (a)(1).

The crux of McDonell's argument is that because\n   <em>\n    Walker\n   </em>\n   held that voucher recipients in State-administered programs must receive contested case hearings,\n   <extracted-citation case-ids=\"3702368\" index=\"105\" url=\"https://cite.case.law/md/422/80/\">\n    422 Md. at 104\n   </extracted-citation>\n   ,\n   <extracted-citation case-ids=\"3702368\" index=\"106\" url=\"https://cite.case.law/md/422/80/\">\n    29 A.3d 293\n   </extracted-citation>\n   , recipients in locally-administered programs should receive these hearings, as well. Additionally, McDonell maintains that failure to provide her with a contested case hearing would produce an absurd result, because those in State-administered programs would receive greater protections than those in locally-administered programs.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-59\">\n   The HCHA responds that, as an agency operating in a single county, it falls outside the scope of the MD APA. It argues that contested case hearings only apply to proceedings before an \"agency,\"\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-60\">\n   State Gov't \u00a7 10-202(d)(1), and that under the MD APA, the HCHA is not an agency.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-61\">\n   We believe this issue presents a relatively straightforward question of statutory interpretation. State Gov't \u00a7 10-203 provides a list of \"general exclusions\" from the contested case hearing procedures. One of the enumerated exceptions includes:\n  </p>\n  <blockquote id=\"p-62\">\n   (4) an officer or unit not part of a principal department of State government that: [i] is created by or pursuant to the Maryland Constitution or general or local law; [ii] operates in only 1 county; and [iii] is subject to the control of a local government or is funded wholly or partly from local funds.\n  </blockquote>\n  <p id=\"p-63\">\n   <em>\n    <extracted-citation case-ids=\"3680114\" index=\"107\" url=\"https://cite.case.law/f2d/425/853/#p867\">\n     Id.\n    </extracted-citation>\n   </em>\n   \u00a7 10-203(a)(4). Clearly, as a county governmental unit, the HCHA is not \"part of a principal department of State government.\" Moreover, it (i) was created pursuant to local law, Harford Cty. Code \u00a7 9-188(H); (ii) operates only in Harford County,\n   <em>\n    <extracted-citation case-ids=\"3702368\" index=\"108\" url=\"https://cite.case.law/md/422/80/\">\n     id.\n    </extracted-citation>\n   </em>\n   \u00a7 9-186; and (iii) is subject to the control of the County Executive,\n   <em>\n    <extracted-citation case-ids=\"3702368\" index=\"109\" url=\"https://cite.case.law/md/422/80/\">\n     id.\n    </extracted-citation>\n   </em>\n   Consequently, the HCHA, and organizations like it, are excluded from the contested case hearing requirements under the terms of the MD APA.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-64\">\n   Likewise, the HCHA falls outside the definition of \"agency.\" Under the statute, a \" 'contested case' means a proceeding\n   before an\n   <strong>\n    agency\n   </strong>\n   to determine ... a right, duty, statutory entitlement, or privilege of a person\" that, under the Constitution, can only be \"determined\" once given the opportunity for a hearing. State Gov't \u00a7 10-202(d)(1) (emphasis added). The term \"agency\" means \"a unit that: (i) is created by general law; (ii) operates in at least 2 counties;\n   <strong>\n    and\n   </strong>\n   (iii) is authorized by law to adjudicate contested cases.\"\n   <em>\n    <extracted-citation case-ids=\"3702368\" index=\"110\" url=\"https://cite.case.law/md/422/80/\">\n     Id.\n    </extracted-citation>\n   </em>\n   \u00a7 10-202(b)(2) (emphasis added).\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-65\">\n   As discussed, the HCHA only operates in one county: Harford County. The Administrative Plan specifically states that the HCHA's jurisdiction includes \"Harford County, Maryland\" and no other location.\n   <em>\n    Admin. Plan\n   </em>\n   , at 1. Thus, the HCHA is not an \"agency\" under the statute, and a contested case hearing could never come before it. In this way, McDonell's case markedly differs from\n   <em>\n    Walker\n   </em>\n   , in which the parties stipulated that the Department of Housing and Community Development was \"a State agency to which the [MD APA] applies.\"\n   <extracted-citation case-ids=\"3702368\" index=\"111\" url=\"https://cite.case.law/md/422/80/\">\n    422 Md. at 92\n   </extracted-citation>\n   ,\n   <extracted-citation case-ids=\"3702368\" index=\"112\" url=\"https://cite.case.law/md/422/80/\">\n    29 A.3d 293\n   </extracted-citation>\n   . Based on this stipulation, we held that the HCVP participant was entitled to a contested case hearing.\n   <em>\n    See\n   </em>\n   <em>\n    <extracted-citation case-ids=\"3702368\" index=\"113\" url=\"https://cite.case.law/md/422/80/\">\n     id.\n    </extracted-citation>\n   </em>\n   <extracted-citation case-ids=\"3702368\" index=\"113\" url=\"https://cite.case.law/md/422/80/\">\n    at 104\n   </extracted-citation>\n   ,\n   <extracted-citation case-ids=\"3702368\" index=\"114\" url=\"https://cite.case.law/md/422/80/\">\n    29 A.3d 293\n   </extracted-citation>\n   .\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-66\">\n   McDonell calls the dichotomy between the MD APA covering some housing voucher recipients, but not others, \"absurd,\"\n   <footnotemark>\n    6\n   </footnotemark>\n   but she offers no plausible legal rationale as to why this arrangement is unlawful. Nor do we see any. We do not concur with McDonell's view of this legislation as a choice to cover some voucher recipients but not others. Rather, the General Assembly apparently chose to impose the more formal APA requirements on larger, state-wide agencies, but not on local ones. This may reflect a legislative concern that the more formal procedures required by the MD APA are too costly and inefficient for a local government to bear-certainly not an absurd rationale. The General Assembly has often demonstrated\n   caution and restraint when imposing mandates on local government, especially those involving additional costs that are not funded by the State.\n   McDonell also offers a three-factor analysis, allegedly prescribed by our administrative common law that, if met, entitles a voucher recipient to a contested case hearing. She asserts that if a hearing involves disputed facts, an adverse impact to liberty or property interests, and no emergency decision is required, then MD APA contested case protections must be provided. But McDonell cites no authority to support this proposition, although the factors she highlights seem to be derived from\n   <em>\n    Goldberg\n   </em>\n   . Even assuming this is an appropriate synthesis and application of the\n   <em>\n    Goldberg\n   </em>\n   requirements, satisfying these elements would only entitle a recipient to a hearing consistent with the Constitution's due process protections, not relief under a statutory scheme from which she is plainly foreclosed.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-67\">\n   For the above reasons, we hold that recipients in locally-administered housing voucher programs, like the one in this case, are not entitled to contested case hearings under the MD APA. This leaves unanswered the question-which we consider next-of whether the HCHA's procedures, as applied here, meet the due process guarantee.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-68\">\n   <em>\n    Procedural Due Process\n   </em>\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-69\">\n   McDonell makes three arguments in support of her claim that she was deprived of procedural due process. First, and most easily resolved, is McDonell's assertion that the Hearing Officer's final decision failed to inform her of her right to seek judicial review. McDonell bases this argument on the MD APA requirement that agencies provide a \"written statement of appeal rights.\" State Gov't \u00a7 10-221(b)(2). But, as we said above, the MD APA does not apply, and so this argument fails.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-70\">\n   Next, McDonell argues that the HCHA failed to maintain an adequate record of the informal hearing. McDonell avers that whatever happened at the informal hearing is\n   entirely unclear from the record and insists that the HCHA is required to maintain a more comprehensive accounting. Yet, McDonell cites no cases providing support for her assertion that due process requires that the hearing be recorded. Indeed, there is case law to the contrary.\n   <em>\n    See\n   </em>\n   <em>\n    Montgomery v. Hous. Auth. of Balt. City\n   </em>\n   ,\n   <extracted-citation case-ids=\"4206916\" index=\"115\" url=\"https://cite.case.law/f-supp-2d/731/439/#p442\">\n    731 F.Supp.2d 439\n   </extracted-citation>\n   , 442 (D.

Generally, we agree with these federal decisions. Neither a recording nor a transcript is mandatory in instances when a reviewing court can determine that due process was accorded and there was substantial evidence to support the decision.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-71\">\n   <em>\n    Adequacy of the HO's Written Decision\n   </em>\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-72\">\n   Finally, McDonell argues that the HCHA failed to issue an adequate decision in light of federal law and its own Administrative Plan. For one, McDonell asserts that the HO's decision did not contain adequate conclusions of law because the only regulation referenced was\n   <extracted-citation index=\"117\" url=\"https://cite.case.law/citations/?q=24%20C.F.R.%20%C2%A7%20982.555\">\n    24 C.F.R. \u00a7 982.555\n   </extracted-citation>\n   (f). Moreover, she alleges, the HO failed to resolve factual disputes based on the evidence presented at the hearing. Rather, she says, the decision was conclusory, merely reciting McDonell's contentions and stating summary disagreement. McDonell claims she was entitled to \"meaningful\" findings, not a repetition of statutory criteria. For these reasons, she maintains that the ultimate decision was\n   inadequate, violating her right to due process. Unlike the others, this argument requires more scrutiny.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-73\">\n   First, we address McDonell's argument, based solely upon\n   <em>\n    Turner v.

In denying the exemption, the Zoning Board used a pre-printed \"ordinance,\" simply filling in the blanks and choosing between \"will\" or \"will not\" options regarding the necessary findings.\n   <em>\n    See\n   </em>\n   <em>\n    id.\n   </em>\n   at 45-46,\n   <extracted-citation index=\"120\" url=\"https://cite.case.law/citations/?q=310%20A.2d%20543\">\n    310 A.2d 543\n   </extracted-citation>\n   .

In\n   <em>\n    Hyson v.

Thus, our zoning cases are inapt, as they are governed by requirements more closely aligned with contested case hearings under the MD APA than with the due process requirement of an informal hearing.

The inspection was completed, but the unit failed to pass the inspection. Restitution is currently paid up to date, although letters were presented from the Housing Agency Accounting Department showing numerous late pays during the term of the Restitution Agreement. Evidence was presented that notification did occur regarding the family not residing in the unit during the term of incarceration, however, this notification was not within the time requirements given by the Housing Agency. Evidence was presented that you were a victim of the assault and not the aggressor, however, it was not refuted that the incarceration did occur per a court order. You testified that you are working to have the charges overturned through the court system, but at this time, your record shows that you have been found guilty by the courts.\n  </blockquote>\n  <blockquote id=\"p-91\">\n   A determination must be made based on the evidence presented at the Hearing.

There is no reason to believe that the HO relied on any inappropriate evidence-e.g.,\n   <em>\n    ex parte\n   </em>\n   evidence, etc.-in his decision. Nor does McDonell claim to the contrary. So, we examine whether the HO appropriately considered and responded to the evidence presented at the hearing.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-93\">\n   \"[T]he decisionmaker's conclusion as to the recipient's eligibility must rest solely on the legal rules and evidence adduced at the hearing.\"\n   <em>\n    Goldberg\n   </em>\n   ,\n   <extracted-citation case-ids=\"12052726\" index=\"161\" url=\"https://cite.case.law/us/397/254/#p265\">\n    397 U.S. at 271\n   </extracted-citation>\n   ,\n   <extracted-citation case-ids=\"12052726\" index=\"162\" url=\"https://cite.case.law/us/397/254/#p265\">\n    90 S.Ct. 1011\n   </extracted-citation>\n   . The HO's decision contains few explicit references to evidence presented during the hearing, but it does contain some. Specifically noted are \"letters presented from the [HCHA] Accounting Department,\" McDonell's testimony\n   that she \"was working to have the [assault] charges overturned,\" and a general allusion to McDonell's \"record\" showing that she \"[had] been found guilty by the courts.\"\n   <footnotemark>\n    9\n   </footnotemark>\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-94\">\n   Some aspects of the decision fall short. One example is the HO's discussion of whether McDonell provided adequate notice to the HCHA regarding her family's absence from the unit. The HO states that \"[e]vidence was presented that notification did occur regarding the family not residing in the unit during the term of incarceration ....\" Yet, he concludes that \"this notification was not within the time requirements given by the Housing Agency.\" The record reveals that McDonell's mother called twice-one message dated and the other undated-to notify the HCHA of McDonell's absence. Yet we cannot tell from the written decision why the HO concluded there was insufficient notice. Accordingly, if the lack of notice of McDonell's absence from the unit were the\n   <em>\n    only\n   </em>\n   grounds for termination, we would be loath to uphold the decision.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-95\">\n   But there is more. The HO also grounded his decision on evidence that McDonell was convicted of assault.\n   <footnotemark>\n    10\n   </footnotemark>\n   The written decision informed McDonell that her participation in the HCVP was terminated because, among other reasons, \"[she was] charged with two counts of Second Degree Assault in the District Court for Harford County\" and that the \"disposition for both charges [was] guilty.\" The decision provides the exact dates for both above instances. Moreover, the HO did not ignore McDonell's claim that she \"was the victim of the assault and not the aggressor,\" or that she \"testified that [she was] working to have the charges overturned.\" The HO paired each piece of evidence back-to-back, intimating that they were weighed against each other. In the end, though, the HO chose to rely on McDonell's criminal conviction in the District Court and uphold termination.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-96\">\n   The HCHA Administrative Plan sets forth that the types of credible evidence to be weighed include \"evidence obtained from police and/or court records.\"\n   <em>\n    Admin. Plan\n   </em>\n   , at 162. Although some information from these sources no doubt would be unreliable or inconclusive, we see no logic in rejecting a judicial verdict of guilt as legitimate grounds for the HO to decide that the assault occurred. In her District Court trial, the State was required to prove McDonell's guilt beyond a reasonable doubt and the panoply of rights accorded criminal defendants was accorded her. The administrative record contains the docket entries, which reflect that McDonell was represented by counsel and entered a plea of Not Guilty.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-97\">\n   We are not persuaded otherwise by McDonell's exercise of her right to a\n   <em>\n    de novo\n   </em>\n   appeal to the Circuit Court pursuant to Md. Code (1974, 1982 Repl. Vol.), \u00a7 12-401 of the Courts and Judicial Proceedings Article, or the subsequent decision by the Circuit Court to vacate the judgment in favor of entering a verdict of probation before judgment.\n   <footnotemark>\n    11\n   </footnotemark>\n   The HO was required\n   to decide whether McDonell committed the assault based on a preponderance of the evidence presented to him at the time of the informal hearing. Evidently, the HO was persuaded that McDonell committed the acts underlying the criminal conviction.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-98\">\n   The HO was not required to defer his decision until after McDonell exhausted her appeal. To hold otherwise would unjustifiably delay prompt and efficient administration of the Voucher Program-not just in this case, but in the potentially countless other cases in which a criminal conviction is a ground for termination. With McDonell's assault conviction as the foundation for the HO's decision, we conclude both that the written decision is adequate, and that due process does not require a recording or transcript of the informal hearing.\n   <footnotemark>\n    12\n   </footnotemark>\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-99\">\n   <strong>\n    Legal Grounds For Termination\n   </strong>\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-100\">\n   A separate question remains-whether the assault conviction or McDonell's underlying actions afforded an appropriate legal basis for termination from the program. We start with\n   the regulatory law that termination from the program is permissible even if only one of the charges is sustained.\n   <em>\n    See\n   </em>\n   <extracted-citation index=\"163\" url=\"https://cite.case.law/citations/?q=24%20C.F.R.%20%C2%A7%20982.552\">\n    24 C.F.R. \u00a7 982.552\n   </extracted-citation>\n   (c)(1).\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-101\">\n   <em>\n    Substantial Evidence Arguments\n   </em>\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-102\">\n   We granted\n   <em>\n    certiorari\n   </em>\n   on several questions that revolve around whether the record contains substantial evidence to support termination for a given offense. \"[T]he PHA may at any time ... terminate program assistance for a participant[ ] for\n   <strong>\n    <em>\n     any\n    </em>\n   </strong>\n   \" of the allowable grounds under the regulation.\n   <extracted-citation index=\"164\" url=\"https://cite.case.law/citations/?q=24%20C.F.R.%20%C2%A7%20982.552\">\n    24 C.F.R. \u00a7 982.552\n   </extracted-citation>\n   (c)(1) (emphasis added).

McDonell argues that second-degree assault does not constitute \"violent criminal activity\" to\n   warrant voucher termination. She points to HUD's definition of \"violent criminal activity\" as a crime with one of its elements being the use or threatened use of force \"substantial enough to cause ... serious bodily injury or property damage,\"\n   <extracted-citation index=\"191\" url=\"https://cite.case.law/citations/?q=24%20C.F.R.%20%C2%A7%205.100\">\n    24 C.F.R. \u00a7 5.100\n   </extracted-citation>\n   , and states that second-degree assault does not have a serious bodily injury requirement as one of its elements. Finally, McDonell argues that the HCHA abused its discretion by \"ignoring\" HUD guidelines that allow PHAs to consider \"other relevant circumstance\" in termination decisions.\n   <footnotemark>\n    14\n   </footnotemark>\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-109\">\n   The HCHA responds that McDonell's reading of the HUD regulations is too\n   limiting. Rather, they say that an agency may terminate a voucher if it finds, by a preponderance of the evidence, that \"the family has been engaged in criminal activity or alcohol abuse as described in [ 24 C.F.R.] \u00a7 982.553,\" regardless of conviction.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-110\">\n   Both parties recognize that criminal activity, generally, is an acceptable ground upon which the HCHA may terminate assistance, as specified in\n   <extracted-citation index=\"192\" url=\"https://cite.case.law/citations/?q=24%20C.F.R.%20%C2%A7%20982.552\">\n    24 CFR \u00a7 982.552\n   </extracted-citation>\n   (c)(1)(xi), which alludes to the definition provided in \u00a7 982.553.\n   <footnotemark>\n    15\n   </footnotemark>\n   Yet, under \u00a7 982.553, \"violent\" criminal activity is not the only criminal activity for which a voucher can be terminated.

The assault charges stem from an incident involving McDonell, her sister, a neighbor, and the neighbor's daughter. We have no transcript of testimony-from either the District Court trial or the HCHA informal hearing-and rely largely on the dual Applications For Statement of Charges-one filed by Joann Douglas against McDonell, and the other filed by McDonell against Douglas. As McDonell describes the events, she was leaving the HCHA property to run errands with her sister when the neighbor and her daughter attacked them. During the altercation, the neighbor and her daughter physically injured both McDonell and her sister and damaged their personal property. Also, in a \"Tenant Complaint Form,\" submitted after her incarceration, McDonell asserts that the neighbor \"assaulted\" her again on two separate occasions.\n   <footnotemark>\n    16\n   </footnotemark>\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-112\">\n   The neighbor, in her Application for Statement of Charges, describes the events differently. She reported that McDonell initiated the confrontation by directing \"racial slurs\" at her and her daughter, and then drove with her sister to the neighbor's home to continue to harass her. Allegedly, McDonell exited her car and attempted to punch the neighbor\n   multiple times, ultimately striking her on the shoulder. The daughter and sister also allegedly began to fight. The neighbor also claims that McDonell pulled out her daughter's braids and scratched her face.\n   When the altercation ended, the neighbor called the police.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-113\">\n   On June 8, 2015, the day of the assault, McDonell pressed charges against her neighbor. On June 11, the neighbor also pressed charges against McDonell for two counts of second-degree assault. Although the State dismissed all charges against the neighbor on August 10, it pursued them against McDonell, and after a September 9 trial, McDonell was found guilty on both charges. McDonell's sister was also found guilty of second-degree assault.\n   <footnotemark>\n    17\n   </footnotemark>\n   The record demonstrates that McDonell appealed her convictions on December 16, 2015, but the judge ordered that the \"terms or conditions of probation not be stayed.\" There is no indication as to the result of the appeal.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-114\">\n   All the above was in the record before the HO during the informal hearing, as well as McDonell's conviction. The HO noted some of these facts in his decision, as described above. The HCHA was not required to prove guilt beyond a reasonable doubt. Instead, the HCHA need only establish, by a preponderance of the evidence, that McDonell committed the violent act or threatened resident health, safety, or peaceable enjoyment for which her voucher was terminated. We concluded earlier that the HO did not ignore McDonell's claim that she \"was the victim of the assault and not the aggressor,\" or that she \"testified that [she was] working to have the charges overturned,\" but decided to rely on the conviction itself to tip the scales. A reviewing court \"must review the agency's decision in the light most favorable to it; the agency's decision is prima facie correct and presumed valid and it is the agency's province to resolve conflicting evidence ....\"\n   <em>\n    Marzullo v.

For this reason, we uphold the HCHA's decision to terminate McDonell's voucher.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-116\">\n   <strong>\n    SUMMARY\n   </strong>\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-117\">\n   In sum, we hold that the HCHA is not an \"agency\" for the purposes of the MD APA, and therefore, McDonell is not entitled to a contested case hearing. McDonell was entitled to due process, which she was accorded by the HCHA through the informal hearing and written decision. The HCHA provided adequate notice before the hearing, and was not required to include notice of her right to appeal. She was not entitled to a transcript of the informal hearing. The Hearing Officer's decision was supported by substantial evidence of qualifying criminal activity. We need not reach the other substantial evidence issues because the above-enumerated reasons are sufficient to uphold the HCHA's decision to terminate McDonell's housing voucher. We disagree with the Court of Special Appeals as to its conclusion that McDonell's due process claim was not adequately preserved. But, we affirm the intermediate appellate court on Petitioner's substantive issues, although, as explained, on somewhat different grounds.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-118\">\n   <strong>\n    JUDGMENT OF THE COURT OF SPECIAL APPEALS IS AFFIRMED.

The recipient is thus aware of the voucher program requirements, even though she might not necessarily be familiar with specific federal regulations at play. McDonell affirmed that she received such a briefing, as indicated by her various signatures on the \"Program Regulation Sheet.\" The informal list of suspected violations provided a sufficient legal basis for the action taken in this circumstance, as it allowed for sufficient notice regarding the regulations alleged to have been violated and, thus, protection against misapplication of the law.\n   </p>\n  </footnote>\n  <footnote label=\"13\">\n   <p id=\"p-143\">\n    <em>\n     See also\n    </em>\n    Maryland Rule 7-401\n    <em>\n     et seq\n    </em>\n    .
