Their household includes their adult son plaintiff Lledon James, who was a licensed driver at all times relevant to this case.\n   <footnotemark>\n    1\n   </footnotemark>\n   Lynval purchased an automobile policy from defendant State Farm Insurance Company (State Farm) listing his wife and son as additional insureds. Plaintiffs claim that when Lynval purchased this policy from State Farm, he requested the maximum Personal Injury Protection (PIP) benefits of $250,000, and designated PIP as primary for medical expenses. After Lledon and his mother Lurline were involved in a car accident, plaintiffs claimed they discovered that the State Farm policy provided only $15,000 in PIP coverage and designated a private health insurance provider as the primary for PIP benefits.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-12\">\n   Plaintiffs filed a verified complaint and an order to show cause seeking to reform the State Farm policy to provide the maximum $250,000 PIP benefits. Plaintiffs argued that the insurance policy as written was invalid because Lledon was covered by Medicaid, not by a private health insurance carrier. Plaintiffs also alleged that State Farm's actions were willful, wanton, intentional, grossly negligent and in reckless disregard of their legal rights.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-13\">\n   State Farm filed a responsive pleading in which it argued it was immune from civil liability as a matter of law pursuant to N.J.S.A. 17:28-1.9(a). Alternatively, State Farm claimed the PIP benefits coverage in the policy is the coverage Lynval requested at the time he purchased the policy. Plaintiffs filed a motion for partial summary\n   judgment, requesting judicial reformation of the policy\n   to reflect $250,000 in PIP coverage. State Farm cross-moved for summary judgment relying on the immunity provided by the Legislature in N.J.S.A. 17:28-1.9(a).\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-14\">\n   The Law Division judge assigned to this case granted summary judgement in favor of State Farm, finding it was immune from liability in this case under N.J.S.A. 17:28-1.9(a). The judge found the record indisputably showed Lynval signed the coverage selection form that contained a $15,000 limitation on PIP benefits coverage and designated the health insurance provider as primary. The motion judge also found that at the time Lynval requested this automobile policy from State Farm, he presented his private health insurance card and his declarations page from his previous automobile insurance policy with Geico, which provided coverage that \"was exactly the same as what was selected from State Farm in this case.\" Finally, the judge noted that Lynval renewed the State Farm automobile policy multiple times over a two-year period without objection or modification.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-15\">\n   In light of these undisputed facts, the judge concluded plaintiffs had not presented evidence that shows State Farm's conduct in this case was willful, wanton, or grossly negligent. The judge held State Farm did not have a legal obligation to determine whether each member of an insured's household is covered by private health insurance at the time the insured signs the coverage selection form. The motion judge granted State Farm's cross-motion for summary judgment and dismissed plaintiffs' verified complaint with prejudice pursuant to the immunity provisions in N.J.S.A. 17:28-1.9(a).\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-16\">\n   In this appeal, plaintiffs argue the Law Division erred when it found State Farm immune from liability under N.J.S.A. 17:28-1.9(a). The New Jersey Association for Justice, appearing as amicus curiae, argues that plaintiffs' policy should be reformed to reflect the maximum PIP benefits available because State Farm's policy violates both State administrative regulations and the federal Medicare Secondary Payer Act. We reject these arguments and affirm substantially for the reasons expressed by the motion\n   judge. We gather the following facts from the record developed before the Law Division.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-17\">\n   I\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-18\">\n   On October 11, 2012, Lynval obtained an auto insurance policy from Joseph Adamo's State Farm Insurance Office in North Arlington. This policy covered Lynval, his wife Lurline, and his adult son Lledon. Lynval gave the insurance agent: (1) a copy of the declarations page from an automobile insurance policy he had with Geico, which contained $15,000 in PIP coverage and a $2,500 deductible; and (2) his private health insurance card. Lynval's private health insurance did not cover his adult son or his wife. Lurline had her own health insurance through United Healthcare/Oxford; Lledon had health insurance with New Jersey Family Care, otherwise known as Medicaid.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-19\">\n   During this initial encounter, Lynval claims he told the State Farm agent that he wanted standard PIP coverage of up to $250,000 and a $2,500 deductible. With respect to the primary coverage for payment of medical expenses, Lynval claims he told the agent he did not want his private health insurance to be the primary medical coverage provider for PIP. According to Lynval, the coverage selection form document was blank when he signed it. He claims he was presented with only the fifth page of the coverage selection form which contained only an area for signatures. He signed the form accordingly. Lynval also\n   claims the remaining pages of the coverage selection form were filled out by the State Farm agent after he signed the form and returned to work. Specifically, Lynval claims the handwriting on the top of the second page of the coverage selection form is not his handwriting; he also did not see this handwriting or the selections contained therein at the time he applied for insurance. Finally, Lynval claims he did not date the document that afternoon and the date reflected at the bottom of page five of the coverage selection form, (which is directly beneath his signature), is not in his handwriting.\n   State Farm refutes these allegations. According to State Farm, its agent provided Lynval with the New Jersey Standard Policy Coverage Selection form that outlines the various types of coverage available for an insured to select. The record shows Lynval signed the coverage selection form and selected $15,000 in PIP coverage with a $2,500 deductible, the same coverage he had previously with Geico. The coverage selection form also shows Lynval selected his personal health insurance policy as the primary for PIP by name and policy number. Lynval authorized this coverage arrangement, effective October 2012. State Farm emphasizes that this policy was automatically renewed several times from October 2012 to September 2014. The automatic renewal documents stated that the PIP medical expense benefit limit was $15,000 with a $2,500 deductible. The documents also included language instructing insureds that \"[i]f the above information is incomplete or inaccurate, or if you want to confirm the information we have in our records please contact your agent.\" Plaintiffs did not take any action to correct or modify this information.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-20\">\n   On September 10, 2014, Lurline and Lledon were both injured in a car accident. Lynval reported the accident to State Farm and submitted a claim for PIP benefits. Although Lynval acknowledged that the policy's declarations page indicated he had selected the option with a $2,500 deductible and a $15,000 PIP limit, he refuted the accuracy of these limitations. Lynval alleged he actually selected $250,000 in PIP coverage. As provided by plaintiffs' automobile policy, State Farm initially referred medical expenses related to the accident to their private health insurance carriers. Later on, a State Farm representative learned that Lledon did not have private health insurance but was covered through New Jersey Family Care, or Medicaid. As required by N.J.S.A. 39:6A-4.3(f), State Farm thereafter provided Lledon with PIP benefits and processed his claims as though he did not have private health insurance at the time of the accident. State Farm applied a deductible of $3,250, comprised of the $2,500 deductible included in the policy and a $750 statutory penalty because Lledon did not have private health insurance.\n   <em>\n    Ibid.\n   </em>\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-21\">\n   II\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-22\">\n   The trial court must grant a motion for summary judgment when \"the pleadings, depositions, answers to interrogatories and admissions on file, together with the affidavits, if any, show that there is no genuine issue as to any material fact challenged and that the moving party is entitled to a judgment or order as a matter of law.\"\n   <em>\n    Templo Fuente De Vida Corp. v.

Here, plaintiffs presented only Lynval's assertions in the form of a deposition and certifications as evidence that Lynval chose the maximum PIP coverage available. By contrast, State Farm produced the completed coverage selection form, its insurance application page, the subsequent policy renewal documents of the policies issued from 2012 through 2014, its payment log, and Adamo's certification showing Lynval requested the $15,000 PIP coverage with a $2,500 deductible.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-30\">\n   Plaintiffs contend that Lynval presented the Geico declarations page only in response to the State Farm agent's request to see what type of insurance policy he had at the time. However, Lynval claims he specifically told the agent that he did not want a policy similar to the original Geico policy. State Farm claims that at this initial meeting, Lynval requested the same coverage he had under his then-current insurance policy with Geico. The State Farm agent alleges that to avoid any misunderstanding, Lynval presented a copy of the declarations page of the Geico policy, which included a $15,000 PIP limit and a $2,500 deductible. During this meeting, Lynval signed the blank coverage selection form, but he did not personally select his coverage on the form because he was on his lunch break and had to quickly return to work. However, even if Lynval did not receive the coverage he allegedly requested, it is not disputed that he did not review the documents State Farm sent him that contained his insurance policy and automatic renewal\n   forms. The only explanation Lynval offered for his failure to review these documents is that he is not \"astute enough to go through\" the forms.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-31\">\n   Willful blindness is not a defense.

Lynval had multiple opportunities to correct this alleged error long before the 2014 accident by reviewing the automatic renewal pages and other documents State Farm provided to him. These documents were specifically designed to apprise consumers like Lynval about the content of their insurance policy and the coverages available. Stated differently, Lynval was obligated to alert State Farm of the inconsistencies between what he allegedly requested and what the policy provided.

Plaintiffs nevertheless argue that the State Farm agent who interacted with Lynval during the initial meeting had the opportunity to ask Lynval to identify the type of health insurance carried by each member of his household. Plaintiffs note that the agent asked Lynval about each potential insured's previous driving history and requested information about each vehicle that would be covered under the policy. The record shows, however, that in response to the agent's request for information about Lynval's health insurance, Lynval presented his private health insurance card. Furthermore, questions about personal health insurance are not among the questions State Farm agents are required to ask potential insureds. At the time plaintiffs acquired the State Farm policy, there was no reasonable basis that would have prompted State\n   Farm to investigate plaintiffs' health insurance status. The State Farm agent did not have a legal obligation to investigate each potential insured's personal health insurance. The Law Division correctly granted State Farm's motion for summary judgment pursuant to the immunity provisions in N.J.S.A. 17:28-1.9.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-47\">\n   Affirmed.\n  </p>\n  <footnote label=\"1\">\n   <p id=\"p-50\">\n    Because plaintiffs have the same last name, we will refer to them by their first names.
