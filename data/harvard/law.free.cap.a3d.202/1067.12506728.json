Carey, appeals from the judgment of conviction, rendered after a jury trial, of murder in violation of General Statutes \u00a7 53a-54a (a).\n   <footnotemark>\n    1\n   </footnotemark>\n   On appeal, the defendant claims that (1) the trial court improperly admitted hearsay testimony, (2) the state engaged in prosecutorial impropriety that deprived her of a fair trial, and (3) the trial court's instruction on witness credibility improperly misled the\n   jury. We disagree and, accordingly,\n   affirm the judgment of the trial court.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-10\">\n   The jury reasonably could have found the following facts. The defendant and the victim, Edward Landry, began dating in May, 1999. Between 1999 and the victim's death in January, 2012, the defendant and the victim had a tumultuous relationship. In 2008, the victim moved into the defendant's house in Glastonbury, where the two lived together until 2011. Many of those acquainted with the defendant and the victim, including their relatives and neighbors, described their relationship as volatile and testified that the two often argued and fought.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-11\">\n   On December 12, 2011, the defendant's twin sister, Johanna Carey-Lang, learned that the victim was having an affair with Jodi D'Onofrio when she walked into the defendant's home and found the victim and D'Onofrio together. That same day, the victim called the defendant and informed her of his infidelity. Nevertheless, later in the day, Carey-Lang saw the defendant and the victim \"cuddling\" on a couch in the defendant's house.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-12\">\n   On December 14, 2011, the victim moved out of the defendant's house and moved to the Carrier Motor Lodge in Newington (motel). On that day, the victim removed his belongings from the defendant's house and left his keys in the house, which, according to D'Onofrio, was an attempt by the victim to communicate to the defendant that their relationship was over. D'Onofrio also testified that the victim told her that he did not want to be in a relationship with the defendant any longer and that he hoped the breakup would be amicable.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-13\">\n   After the victim moved to the motel, he and the defendant remained in contact. Between December 15, 2011 and January 2, 2012, the two exchanged over ninety-five phone calls and twenty-five text messages. Additionally,\n   the defendant and the victim saw each other in person several times during that period.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-14\">\n   On December 18, 2011, the defendant checked into the motel and rented a room close to the victim's. The defendant called Carey-Lang from the motel room and asked her to set up a three way phone call with the victim. D'Onofrio was with the victim when he received the defendant's call. According to D'Onofrio, the defendant asked the victim whether he still loved her, to which the victim responded that he loved D'Onofrio. The victim subsequently informed his friend, Jessica Montano, of his interaction with the defendant on December 18, 2011. According to Montano, the victim recounted that the defendant begged him not to end their relationship and that, as a result of this interaction, the victim feared the defendant.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-15\">\n   On January 2, 2012, the defendant and Carey-Lang went to the shooting range at Hoffman's Gun Center (gun center) in Newington. Leon Brazalovich, Carey-Lang's boyfriend, accompanied the sisters to the gun center, but did not shoot while he was there. The defendant and Carey-Lang, both of whom had gun permits, signed in at the front desk and proceeded to shoot at the range for approximately thirty minutes to an hour. The defendant used her gun, a pink .380 Ruger light pistol, to shoot. After the defendant and Carey-Lang left the range, the defendant asked Brazalovich to load ammunition she had just purchased at the gun center into two magazines.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-16\">\n   At 1:33 p.m., while the defendant was at the shooting range, she received a call from the victim. After speaking to the victim, the defendant told Carey-Lang that she planned to bring him lunch at the motel. At around 2 p.m., the defendant drove Carey-Lang and Brazalovich to Boston Market, where the defendant ordered lunch. The defendant then drove to the\n   motel, where she got\n   out of the car and went to the victim's room, carrying the food and her purse, which contained her gun.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-17\">\n   About forty-five minutes after the defendant arrived at the motel, Carey-Lang sent the defendant a text message, informing her that she and Brazalovich had finished lunch. The defendant responded that she would like to spend another hour at the motel, and Carey-Lang told her to call when she was ready to be picked up.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-18\">\n   Three hours later, at approximately 4:20 p.m., the defendant sent Carey-Lang a text message, asking: \"When will you be here.\" Approximately one minute later, the defendant again texted Carey-Lang, asking: \"When can you pick me up? After dance?\" Between 5:35 and 6:51 p.m., the following text message exchange took place:\n  </p>\n  <blockquote id=\"p-19\">\n   \"[The Defendant]: How long before you get here\n  </blockquote>\n  <blockquote id=\"p-20\">\n   \"[Carey-Lang]: I [don't] know. Why\n  </blockquote>\n  <blockquote id=\"p-21\">\n   \"[The Defendant]: Because he is yelling and threatening me.\n  </blockquote>\n  <blockquote id=\"p-22\">\n   \"[Carey-Lang]: Why\n  </blockquote>\n  <blockquote id=\"p-23\">\n   \"[The Defendant]: He hate[s] me\n  </blockquote>\n  <blockquote id=\"p-24\">\n   \"[Carey-Lang]: What happened\n  </blockquote>\n  <blockquote id=\"p-25\">\n   \"[The Defendant]: How long before you get here\n  </blockquote>\n  <blockquote id=\"p-26\">\n   \"[Carey-Lang]: [I'm] at [Dani's] g class. [Can't] leave\n  </blockquote>\n  <blockquote id=\"p-27\">\n   \"[Carey-Lang]: I [don't] know\n  </blockquote>\n  <blockquote id=\"p-28\">\n   \"[The Defendant]: How long?\n  </blockquote>\n  <blockquote id=\"p-29\">\n   \"[The Defendant]: ? ? ?\n  </blockquote>\n  <blockquote id=\"p-30\">\n   \"[The Defendant]: Hello....\n  </blockquote>\n  <blockquote id=\"p-31\">\n   \"[Carey-Lang]: Just leaving\n  </blockquote>\n  <blockquote id=\"p-32\">\n   \"[The Defendant]: How long\"\n  </blockquote>\n  <p id=\"p-33\">\n   Between 7:02 and 7:04 p.m., Carey-Lang sent the defendant text messages instructing the defendant to meet her at an Aldi market near the motel in five minutes. Approximately eight minutes later, Carey-Lang sent the defendant a text message stating that she was at Aldi. About eighteen minutes after that, at approximately 7:30 p.m., the defendant called Carey-Lang and asked her to come to the victim's room. Sometime during the period in which the defendant and Carey-Lang discussed meeting at Aldi, the defendant shot and killed the victim.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-34\">\n   When Carey-Lang arrived at the motel, the defendant invited her into the room and informed her that \"[the victim] came after [the defendant] with a knife, and that he put a hit on [their] family, and he was going to take care of [the defendant] himself.\" The victim's body was on the floor when Carey-Lang entered the room, but she did not recall seeing a knife near the victim. She checked the victim's pulse and could not detect one. Carey-Lang then instructed the defendant to call 911, but the defendant refused to do so.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-35\">\n   At approximately 8 p.m., the defendant and Carey-Lang left the motel room. The defendant took the shell casings, which she placed in her pocket, with her purse, her cell phone, and the bag of food from Boston Market. The two drove from the motel directly to the home of their brother, Joseph Carey, in Wethersfield.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-36\">\n   During the drive to Wethersfield, Carey-Lang continued to encourage the defendant to call 911. Once they arrived in Wethersfield, Carey-Lang and Joseph Carey urged the defendant to return to the motel and call 911.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-37\">\n   Eventually, the defendant agreed, and Carey-Lang drove her back to the motel. Once they reached the motel, however, the defendant changed her mind and refused to go back into the victim's room. Carey-Lang drove to a nearby parking lot and called Joseph Carey\n   to ask if he would join them. When Joseph Carey arrived at the parking lot, Carey-Lang called their father, who also encouraged the defendant\n   to call 911. After Joseph Carey spoke with the defendant, Carey-Lang drove the defendant back to the motel, where she \"sort of tried to push [the defendant] out of the car\" and drove away.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-38\">\n   After being dropped off at the motel, the defendant returned to the victim's room, where she called Carey-Lang three more times, once at 9:35 p.m. and twice at 9:50 p.m. During the second 9:50 p.m. call, the defendant asked Carey-Lang to come back to the motel and pick her up, but Carey-Lang refused to do so.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-39\">\n   Finally, at approximately 10 p.m., almost three hours after the defendant shot the victim, the defendant called 911. The defendant told the 911 operator: \"My boyfriend and I were, you know, just talking and all of a sudden he got real angry, he came at me with a knife, and I was scared. I shot him.\" The operator asked whether the victim was moving, and the defendant responded, \"I don't think so.\" The defendant also told the operator that she \"didn't even know if [she] hit him\" and, when asked whether she was injured, the defendant said: \"I don't know. I don't think so.\"\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-40\">\n   The police arrived at the motel at approximately 10:13 p.m. and instructed the defendant to exit the victim's room. Once the defendant had exited the room, the police placed her in the back of a police vehicle. The police then entered the room, where they found the victim's body on the floor between two beds. Matthew D'Esposito, an officer with the Newington Police Department, \"noticed that [the victim] was not breathing, [and that] he had no carotid pulse.\" D'Esposito testified that \"[t]here was some slight rigor mortis in [the victim's] pinky fingers ....\" After efforts to resuscitate the victim at the scene failed, he was transported to Hartford Hospital, where he was pronounced dead on arrival.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-41\">\n   When the police searched the room, they found, on the floor, the defendant's gun and three shell casings that were subsequently determined to have been fired from that gun. They also found the defendant's purse, which contained a gun holster and case, as well as a magazine containing six .380 caliber bullets. The defendant's purse also contained a pair of latex gloves. The defendant's DNA was found on the exterior of the gloves.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-42\">\n   After the defendant was placed in the back of the police vehicle, she was transported to the Hospital of Central Connecticut (hospital), in New Britain, because she was verbally unresponsive. When the defendant arrived at the hospital around 10:45 p.m., she was still unresponsive. From 12:30 a.m. to 7:30 a.m., on January 3, 2012, the defendant failed to respond to painful stimuli. Finally, around 7:30 a.m., she was revived by a sternal rub. Hamid Ehsani, an emergency physician at the hospital, diagnosed the defendant with conversion disorder, which is \"a change in the neurologic status of a patient which cannot be explained easily by any obvious medical condition.\" Ehsani was unable to rule out a diagnosis of malingering, which, in Ehsani's words, \"is when one acts in a certain way ... to suit [his or her] purposes at the time.\" At approximately 8 a.m., on January 3, 2012, the defendant was discharged into police custody.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-43\">\n   The jurors heard evidence from various witnesses at trial. Jason Daniel Elkins, who was in the room next to the victim's on the night of the shooting, testified that he heard three gunshots between 7:16 and 7:38 p.m., but that he did not hear any noises from the room prior to the gunshots.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-44\">\n   Ira Kanfer, a medical examiner employed by the Office of the Chief Medical Examiner for the state of Connecticut, testified that the victim had been shot\n   three times-once in his left shoulder, once in his lower left abdomen and once in the left side of his chest. Three bullets\n   matching the caliber of the defendant's gun were found inside the victim's body. Kanfer estimated that the victim's death was instantaneous or would have occurred within thirty to forty-five seconds of the time of the shooting.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-45\">\n   John Brunetti, a fingerprint examiner employed by the state forensic lab, testified that he was unable to find latent fingerprints on any of the six knives belonging to the victim that were found inside the victim's room. Fung Kwok, a forensic examiner employed by the state forensic lab, testified that gunshot residue was found on both the defendant's and the victim's hands.\n   <footnotemark>\n    2\n   </footnotemark>\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-46\">\n   This appeal followed. Additional facts and procedural history will be set forth as necessary.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-47\">\n   I\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-48\">\n   The defendant first argues that the trial court erred in admitting the testimony of Mark Manganello, a friend of the victim, to explain the victim's fear of the defendant and to rebut the defendant's claim of self-defense. Specifically, the defendant argues that Manganello's testimony was inadmissible hearsay and that she was prejudiced by the admission of the statements. The state argues that the court did not abuse its discretion in admitting Manganello's testimony under the residual hearsay exception. The state further argues that, even if the trial court erred in admitting Manganello's testimony, the error was harmless. We agree with the state that, even if the trial court erred in admitting Manganello's testimony, any such error was harmless.\n   <footnotemark>\n    3\n   </footnotemark>\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-49\">\n   The following additional facts and procedural history are relevant to the resolution of this claim. Before trial, the defendant filed a motion in limine to preclude Manganello from testifying about conversations he had had with the victim. The defendant argued that the statements were double hearsay and that, even if the defendant's statements to the victim fell within the state of mind exception to the hearsay rule, the second layer of hearsay-the victim's statements to Manganello-did not fall within any recognized hearsay exception. The state objected to the defendant's motion, arguing that the statements were admissible under the state of mind exception to show that the victim feared the defendant.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-50\">\n   The court denied the defendant's motion, stating: \"The state is offering this evidence as to a prior bad act of the defendant, and [it is] claiming that it is relevant with respect to intent and motive. Testimony of the victim's fear of the defendant is relevant, especially in a case where there is a homicide that involves ... a domestic situation where there's evidence of a deteriorating relationship. It's also relevant to intent and motive and to rebut a defendant's self-defense claim. Again, this evidence will be subject to a limiting instruction to the jury that [it is] not to consider the evidence as establishing a predisposition on the part of the defendant to commit the crime charged or to demonstrate a criminal propensity but, rather, that it bears on the issue of the defendant's intent and motive in the case.\"\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-51\">\n   At trial, Manganello testified that the victim told him that he went to the defendant's house on December 24, 2011, to retrieve some belongings. The victim told Manganello that he thought the defendant\n   was not at home, and that he entered the house by crawling through a window. Once he got inside, the victim encountered the defendant, who pointed a gun at him and told him\n   that if he ever returned \"she would blow his f'ing brains out.\"\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-52\">\n   We begin by briefly setting forth the relevant standard of review and legal principles for this claim. \"To the extent a trial court's admission of evidence is based on an interpretation of the Code of Evidence, our standard of review is plenary.... We review the trial court's decision to admit evidence, if premised on a correct view of the law, however, for an abuse of discretion.\" (Citations omitted.)\n   <em>\n    State\n   </em>\n   v.\n   <em>\n    Saucier\n   </em>\n   ,\n   <extracted-citation case-ids=\"5730505\" index=\"0\" url=\"https://cite.case.law/conn/283/207/#p218\">\n    283 Conn. 207\n   </extracted-citation>\n   , 218,\n   <extracted-citation index=\"1\" url=\"https://cite.case.law/citations/?q=926%20A.2d%20633\">\n    926 A.2d 633\n   </extracted-citation>\n   (2007).\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-53\">\n   \"[W]hen an improper evidentiary ruling is not constitutional in nature, the defendant bears the burden of demonstrating that the error was harmful.... [W]hether [the improper admission of a witness' testimony] is harmless in a particular case depends upon a number of factors, such as the importance of the witness' testimony in the prosecution's case, whether the testimony was cumulative, the presence or absence of evidence corroborating or contradicting the testimony of the witness on material points, the extent of cross-examination otherwise permitted, and, of course, the overall strength of the prosecution's case.... Most importantly, we must examine the impact of the [improperly admitted] evidence on the trier of fact and the result of the trial.... [T]he proper standard for determining whether an erroneous evidentiary ruling is harmless should be whether the jury's verdict was substantially swayed by the error.... Accordingly, a nonconstitutional error is harmless when an appellate court has a fair assurance that the error did not substantially affect the verdict.\" (Internal quotation marks omitted.)\n   <em>\n    State\n   </em>\n   v.\n   <em>\n    LeBlanc\n   </em>\n   ,\n   <extracted-citation case-ids=\"12415378\" index=\"2\" url=\"https://cite.case.law/conn-app/148/503/#p508\">\n    148 Conn.

After shooting the victim sometime between 7:16 and 7:38 p.m., the defendant did not call 911. Instead, the defendant called and texted Carey-Lang, asking her to come to the motel. When Carey-Lang came to the room, she encouraged the defendant to call 911, but the defendant refused. Ultimately, the defendant retrieved the shell casings off of the floor and gathered her belongings, including her cell phone, her purse, and the bag of food she had brought, and left the motel with Carey-Lang. After leaving the motel, the defendant continued to refuse to call 911, despite being urged to do so by her brother and her father.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-55\">\n   The defendant also ignored her family members' entreaties that she return to the scene of the shooting. In fact, the defendant returned to the motel only after being physically pushed out of Carey-Lang's car. Even after the defendant returned to the motel room, she called Carey-Lang and begged her to return to the motel and pick her up. Then, before the defendant finally called 911 at approximately 10:20 p.m., she staged the scene, putting the shell casings she had earlier picked up back on the floor.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-56\">\n   Moreover, the defendant misled the 911 operator when she reported the shooting. Almost three hours had elapsed since the shooting, but the defendant suggested that the shooting had just occurred. Additionally, even though the defendant knew that the victim had died hours earlier, she told the operator: \"I don't\n   <em>\n    think\n   </em>\n   [he's moving].\" (Emphasis added.) In response to the operator's\n   inquiry as to where the victim had been shot, the defendant said: \"I didn't even know if I hit him.\" On the basis of the foregoing, we conclude that any error\n   in the admission of Manganello's testimony did not substantially affect the verdict and, therefore, was harmless.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-57\">\n   II\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-58\">\n   The defendant next argues that the state engaged in prosecutorial impropriety that deprived her of a fair trial.\n   <footnotemark>\n    4\n   </footnotemark>\n   Specifically, the defendant claims that the state engaged in prosecutorial impropriety when the prosecutor made certain comments during (1) the defendant's direct examination and (2) the prosecutor's closing argument. In response, the state argues that the prosecutor's comments were not improper and contends that, even if they were, they did not deprive the defendant of a fair trial. We conclude that there is no evidence in the record that the state engaged in prosecutorial impropriety.\n   <footnotemark>\n    5\n   </footnotemark>\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-59\">\n   We begin by setting forth the applicable standard of review and legal principles for claims of prosecutorial impropriety. \"In analyzing claims of prosecutorial [impropriety], [the reviewing court] engage[s] in a two step analytical process. The two steps are separate and distinct: (1) whether [an impropriety] occurred in the first instance; and (2) whether that [impropriety] deprived a defendant of [her] due process right to a fair trial.\" (Internal quotation marks omitted.)\n   <em>\n    State\n   </em>\n   v.\n   <em>\n    Warholic\n   </em>\n   ,\n   <extracted-citation case-ids=\"3665956\" index=\"6\" url=\"https://cite.case.law/conn/278/354/#p361\">\n    278 Conn. 354\n   </extracted-citation>\n   , 361,\n   <extracted-citation index=\"7\" url=\"https://cite.case.law/citations/?q=897%20A.2d%20569\">\n    897 A.2d 569\n   </extracted-citation>\n   (2006). \"[W]hen a defendant raises on appeal a claim that improper remarks by the prosecutor deprived the defendant of his constitutional right to a fair trial, the burden is on the defendant to show, not only that the remarks were improper, but also that, considered in light of the\n   whole trial, the improprieties were so egregious that they amounted to a denial of due process.... On the other hand ... if the defendant raises a claim that the prosecutorial improprieties infringed a specifically enumerated constitutional right, such as the fifth amendment right to remain silent or the sixth amendment right to confront one's accusers, and the defendant meets his burden of establishing the constitutional violation, the burden is then on the state to prove that the impropriety was harmless beyond a reasonable doubt.\" (Citation omitted.)\n   <em>\n    State\n   </em>\n   v.\n   <em>\n    Payne\n   </em>\n   ,\n   <extracted-citation case-ids=\"12174344\" index=\"8\" url=\"https://cite.case.law/conn/303/538/#p562\">\n    303 Conn. 538\n   </extracted-citation>\n   , 562-63,\n   <extracted-citation index=\"9\" url=\"https://cite.case.law/citations/?q=34%20A.3d%20370\">\n    34 A.3d 370\n   </extracted-citation>\n   (2012).\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-60\">\n   A\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-61\">\n   First, the defendant argues that the state engaged in prosecutorial impropriety when, during direct examination of the defendant, the prosecutor stated that defense counsel was \"cheating.\" The defendant argues that this comment impugned the credibility and trustworthiness of defense counsel and, therefore, was impermissible. We disagree.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-62\">\n   The following additional facts are relevant to this claim. During the defendant's direct examination, the following exchange occurred:\n  </p>\n  <blockquote id=\"p-63\">\n   \"[Defense Counsel]: Now, do you know how many calls you received from December 14, [2011], from [the victim] up until the point of January 2, [2012]?

In the present case, the prosecutor's comment was not addressed to the jury, and while defense counsel speculated that the jury might have heard the prosecutor, there is no evidence that anyone, other than defense counsel, heard the comment. In fact, the court reporter did not record the comment. Indeed, the comment might not have been heard by any members of the jury had defense counsel not repeated it by stating, on the record, that the prosecutor had just accused him of cheating. Furthermore, instead of moving for a mistrial when the prosecutor made the comment at issue, the defendant proceeded with trial and did not move for a mistrial until the eve of jury deliberations.

While a prosecutor may argue the state's case forcefully, such argument must be fair and based upon the facts in evidence and the reasonable inferences to be drawn therefrom....

The prosecutor's comment was permissible under this court's decision in\n   <em>\n    Gordon\n   </em>\n   . Additionally, defense counsel raised the matter when he opined on D'Onofrio's credibility. The prosecutor's\n   comment in the present case, like that of the prosecutor in\n   <em>\n    Brown\n   </em>\n   , responded directly to the statements of defense counsel.

Although defense counsel insisted that the prosecutor used the term \"disregard\" when discussing the extreme emotional disturbance instruction during closing argument, the use of this verb is not borne out by the record. The transcript reflects that the prosecutor merely pointed out that there was not a factual basis for the jury to find that the defendant proved the affirmative defense of extreme emotional disturbance. In so doing, the prosecutor\n   did not tell the jury to disregard the court's charge; rather, he remarked on the lack of evidence available to the members of the jury in their consideration of the affirmative defense of extreme emotional disturbance instruction. On this basis, we conclude that the prosecutor did not improperly direct the jury to ignore the court's instructions\n   with regard to the affirmative defense of extreme emotional disturbance.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-89\">\n   3\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-90\">\n   Third, the defendant claims that the prosecutor improperly argued facts not in evidence twice during closing argument-once when he said that the defendant did not take her car to the motel because she was trying to avoid being caught on surveillance cameras, and again, when he said that Carey-Lang impermissibly spoke with the defendant during trial. The state argues that these comments supported reasonable inferences that the jury could have drawn from the evidence presented. We agree with the state.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-91\">\n   The following additional facts and procedural history are relevant to this claim. At trial, the jury heard a tape recorded conversation between the defendant and Carey-Lang. In this conversation, the defendant asked Carey-Lang to send photographs of her home to her counsel, which Carey-Lang said she could not do because there was a sequestration order in place. The court informed the jury that the recording was to be used for impeachment purposes only, not to show that Carey-Lang violated the sequestration order. During closing argument, the prosecutor said: \"[The defendant] brings in her sister again, [Carey-Lang], who we already know has violated the court's order about not talking about the evidence when she talked to her sister about the case.\"\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-92\">\n   The jury also heard evidence that the motel where the victim was shot had been the site of criminal activity in the past. The defendant testified that she brought her gun with her to the motel because she believed it was in a dangerous area. During closing argument, the prosecutor said that the defendant did not drive her own car to the motel because \"[s]he [could] reasonably expect there'd be video cameras\" at the motel.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-93\">\n   It is well established that \"[c]ounsel may comment upon facts properly in evidence and upon reasonable inferences to be drawn from them.... Counsel may not, however, comment on or suggest an inference from facts not in evidence.\" (Internal quotation marks omitted.)\n   <em>\n    State\n   </em>\n   v.\n   <em>\n    Lopez\n   </em>\n   ,\n   <extracted-citation case-ids=\"5730490\" index=\"32\" url=\"https://cite.case.law/conn/280/779/#p803\">\n    280 Conn. 779\n   </extracted-citation>\n   , 803,\n   <extracted-citation index=\"33\" url=\"https://cite.case.law/citations/?q=911%20A.2d%201099\">\n    911 A.2d 1099\n   </extracted-citation>\n   (2007) ; see, e.g., id., at 804,\n   <extracted-citation index=\"34\" url=\"https://cite.case.law/citations/?q=911%20A.2d%201099\">\n    911 A.2d 1099\n   </extracted-citation>\n   (\"the prosecutor did not rely on a fact not in evidence when he drew the jury's attention to the fact that the testimony of the witnesses who could not specifically identify the defendant was not inconsistent with the testimony of the two witnesses who did identify him\").\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-94\">\n   In the present case, the comments the prosecutor made during closing argument asked the jury to draw reasonable inferences from facts that were properly in evidence. When the prosecutor commented on Carey-Lang's violation of the sequestration order, the jury had already heard the recording of the phone call that supported that assertion. Similarly, the prosecutor's comment regarding surveillance cameras was based on inferences the jury could draw from evidence that the defendant believed that the motel was in a dangerous area. As the prosecutor pointed out, the defendant could \"reasonably expect\" that there were surveillance cameras at the motel because it was in an area where criminal activity might occur. Additionally, the prosecutor did not explicitly state that the motel had surveillance cameras. Rather, he said that the defendant could \"reasonably expect\" that the motel had them.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-95\">\n   We conclude, therefore, that the prosecutor did not improperly argue facts that were not in evidence.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-96\">\n   4\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-97\">\n   Fourth, the defendant argues that the prosecutor impermissibly gave his personal opinion regarding her credibility during closing argument. We disagree.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-98\">\n   The following additional facts and procedural history are relevant to this claim. During closing argument, the prosecutor said the following to the jury: \"I submit that the defendant's credibility is nonexistent. Her claim of self-defense is incredible and ... the state has disproved it beyond a reasonable doubt.\" The prosecutor then discussed evidence from the defendant's testimony in support of the state's argument that the defendant was not a credible witness. When defense counsel moved for a mistrial, he argued that the prosecutor, during closing argument, had called the defendant a \"liar\" and accused her of \"deliberately\" lying.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-99\">\n   \"[A] prosecutor may not express his [or her] own opinion, directly or indirectly, as to the credibility of the witnesses.... Such expressions of personal opinion are a form of unsworn and unchecked testimony, and are particularly difficult for the jury to ignore because of the prosecutor's special position.... Put another way, the prosecutor's opinion carries with it the imprimatur of the [state] and may induce the jury to trust the [state's] judgment rather than its own view of the evidence.... Moreover, because the jury is aware that the prosecutor has prepared and presented the case and consequently, may have access to matters not in evidence ... it is likely to infer that such matters precipitated the personal opinions.... However, [i]t is not improper for the prosecutor to comment upon the evidence presented at trial and to argue the inferences that the jurors might draw therefrom .... We must give the jury the credit of being able to differentiate between argument on the evidence and attempts to persuade [it] to draw inferences in the state's favor, on one hand, and improper unsworn testimony, with the suggestion of secret knowledge, on the other hand.\" (Citation omitted; internal quotation marks omitted.)\n   <em>\n    State\n   </em>\n   v.\n   <em>\n    Stevenson\n   </em>\n   , supra,\n   <extracted-citation case-ids=\"8458155\" index=\"35\" url=\"https://cite.case.law/conn/269/563/#p583\">\n    269 Conn. at 583\n   </extracted-citation>\n   ,\n   <extracted-citation index=\"36\" url=\"https://cite.case.law/citations/?q=849%20A.2d%20626\">\n    849 A.2d 626\n   </extracted-citation>\n   ; see, e.g., id., at 584,\n   <extracted-citation index=\"37\" url=\"https://cite.case.law/citations/?q=849%20A.2d%20626\">\n    849 A.2d 626\n   </extracted-citation>\n   (\"The assistant state's attorney's remark during\n   closing argument describing the defendant's explanation as to how he obtained money to buy drugs as 'totally unbelievable' did not necessarily express her personal opinion.

Like the prosecutor's comment in\n   <em>\n    Stevenson\n   </em>\n   , the prosecutor's comments regarding the defendant's credibility in the present case were based on reasonable inferences that could be made based on the defendant's testimony and demeanor at trial. In fact, the prosecutor specifically cited evidence in support of his comments about the defendant's lack of credibility, including the defendant's testimony regarding text messages that she exchanged with the victim on December 31, 2011,\n   <footnotemark>\n    8\n   </footnotemark>\n   and \"her story, what she claims actually happened in [the victim's room]\" prior to the shooting.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-101\">\n   Moreover, at the outset of closing argument, the prosecutor cautioned the jury to ignore any expressions of personal opinion he might make, stating: \"I don't intend to offer you my personal opinion on this case. My personal opinion is completely irrelevant. So, if there's ever a point in my argument ... that you feel I'm expressing a personal opinion, please disregard that. That is not my intention.\" Based on the foregoing, we conclude that the prosecutor did not improperly express his personal opinion as to the defendant's credibility.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-102\">\n   III\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-103\">\n   Finally, the defendant claims that the trial court abused its discretion and misled the jury by giving a falsus in uno instruction.\n   <footnotemark>\n    9\n   </footnotemark>\n   Specifically, the defendant argues that, because falsus in uno instructions are not mandatory in Connecticut and other courts have advised against them, the court erred in giving such an instruction.

We agree with the state.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-104\">\n   We begin by setting forth the standard of review relevant to this claim. \"Our review of [a jury instruction] claim requires that we examine the [trial] court's entire charge to determine whether it is reasonably [probable] that the jury could have been misled ....

If a requested charge is in substance given, the [trial] court's failure to give a charge in exact conformance with the words of the request will not constitute a ground for reversal.... As long as [the instructions] are correct in law, adapted to the issues and sufficient for the guidance of the jury ... we will not view the instructions as improper.... Additionally, we have noted that [a]n [impropriety] in instructions in a criminal case is reversible ... when it is shown that it is reasonably possible for [improprieties] of constitutional dimension or reasonably probable for nonconstitutional [improprieties] that the jury [was] misled....

The following instruction was included in the court's proposed jury instructions: \"If you conclude that a witness has deliberately testified falsely in some respect, you should carefully consider whether you should rely on any of that person's testimony.\" The defendant objected to the proposed jury instructions twice and requested that the quoted sentence be removed. The defendant argued that this instruction was prejudicial because the case \"turn[ed] so tightly on whether [the jury] believe[d] her testimony ....\" The state argued that the instruction ought to be given in the present case because it believed that the defendant testified falsely about a series of text messages that she exchanged with the victim on December 31, 2011.\n   <footnotemark>\n    10\n   </footnotemark>\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-106\">\n   The court's final instructions included the sentence to which the defendant had objected. The court qualified this instruction by including the following language in the jury charge: \"In deciding whether or not to believe a witness, keep in mind that people sometimes forget things. You need to consider, therefore, whether a contradiction is an innocent lapse of memory or an intentional falsehood, and that may depend on whether it has to do with an important fact or with only a small detail.\"\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-107\">\n   \"Connecticut recognizes the maxim falsus in uno, falsus in omnibus as a permissive instruction....\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-108\">\n   Instruction on the maxim is a matter resting in the sound discretion of the trial judge....

Like the trial court in\n   <em>\n    Opotzner\n   </em>\n   , the court in the present case correctly stated the falsus in uno maxim and informed the jury that it could, in its judgment, choose whether to believe a witness. The falsus in uno instruction provided by the court in the present case correctly stated the law and merely advised the members of the jury as to their task of weighing witness credibility.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-109\">\n   The defendant cites decisions from other courts, including state courts in Florida, Alabama, and Rhode Island, and two federal circuit courts of appeal, which advise against the use of falsus in uno instructions. These decisions, however, are merely potentially persuasive authority, and the defendant has failed to cite any Connecticut case law that disapproves generally of the use of falsus in uno instructions. Indeed, the charge has been used in Connecticut for many years.

We, therefore, are not persuaded that we should overrule such an established practice. Moreover, the defendant has not demonstrated how the instruction misled the jury in the present case.
