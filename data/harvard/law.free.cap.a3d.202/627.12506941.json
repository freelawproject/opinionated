We also consider if an insurer may exclude UIM coverage for an accident involving a vehicle owned by the insured but not covered under the subject policy.

Prior to settling with the other driver for his policy limit of $25,000, plaintiff submitted a UIM claim under three insurance policies he maintained: a motorcycle policy issued by defendant Rider Insurance Company (Rider), a commercial auto policy issued by defendant Farmers Insurance Company of Flemington (Farmers), and a personal auto policy issued by defendant\n   Government Employees Insurance Company (GEICO).\n   <footnotemark>\n    1\n   </footnotemark>\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-15\">\n   In response, GEICO \"disclaim[ed] coverage\" based on an exclusion in its policy. In its disclaimer letter, GEICO identified the relevant policy language supporting its decision.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-16\">\n   Section IV of GEICO's policy, which addresses both UM and UIM coverages, provides, in relevant part:\n  </p>\n  <blockquote id=\"p-17\">\n   LOSSES WE PAY\n  </blockquote>\n  <blockquote id=\"p-18\">\n   We will pay damages for\n   <em>\n    bodily injury\n   </em>\n   and\n   <em>\n    property damage\n   </em>\n   caused by an accident which the insured is legally entitled to recover from the owner or operator of an\n   <em>\n    uninsured motor vehicle\n   </em>\n   or\n   <em>\n    underinsured motor vehicle\n   </em>\n   arising out of the ownership, maintenance[,] or use of that vehicle.\n  </blockquote>\n  <p id=\"p-19\">\n   However, Section IV excludes coverage for \"\n   <em>\n    bodily injury\n   </em>\n   sustained by an\n   <em>\n    insured\n   </em>\n   while occupying a motor vehicle owned by an\n   <em>\n    insured\n   </em>\n   and not described in the [d]eclarations and not covered by the Bodily Injury and Property Damage liability coverages of this policy.\" Because the motorcycle, although owned by plaintiff, was not listed on the policy it issued, GEICO determined it did not constitute an \"owned auto,\" which the policy defined as a \"vehicle described in this policy for which a premium charge is shown for these coverages.\" Based upon this determination, GEICO denied plaintiff's claim.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-20\">\n   Upon receiving GEICO's disclaimer, plaintiff filed a complaint against all three defendant insurance carriers, seeking a declaratory judgment that the UIM coverage of all three carriers applied to the subject accident. GEICO then filed a motion for a declaratory judgment, urging the court to find its owned-motor-vehicle exclusion \"valid, unambiguous, and enforceable.\" The motion court denied GEICO's motion, viewing the language of GEICO's policy as ambiguous, and holding that GEICO failed \"to comply with the statutory requirements [of] N.J.S.A. 17:28-1.1.\"\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-21\">\n   The parties thereafter came to an agreement that Rider and Farmers would pay their pro-rata share of the $975,000 in UIM coverage owed to plaintiff, and GEICO would take this appeal; if GEICO does not prevail, it would pay its pro-rata share as well. Plaintiff, Rider, and Farmers (respondents) all oppose GEICO's appeal and urge us to affirm.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-22\">\n   II.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-23\">\n   We review the interpretation of a contract de novo.\n   <em>\n    Manalapan Realty, L.P. v.

GEICO asserts its exclusion unambiguously bars UIM coverage for a loss sustained by plaintiff while operating a motor vehicle he owned but did not insure under GEICO's policy. We agree.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-28\">\n   Respondents argue GEICO's policy, which addresses both UM and UIM coverage in the same section, violates the statutory mandate that all motor vehicle liability policies, except basic automobile insurance policies, shall include coverage \"for payment of all or part of the sums which the insured or his legal representative shall be legally entitled to recover as damages from the operator or owner of an uninsured motor vehicle ....\" N.J.S.A. 17:28-1.1. This violation of the statutory mandate regarding UM coverage, respondents assert, renders the entire section ambiguous.\n   <em>\n    See\n   </em>\n   <em>\n    Rider Ins. Co. v. First Trenton Cos.\n   </em>\n   ,\n   <extracted-citation case-ids=\"1166485\" index=\"16\" url=\"https://cite.case.law/nj-super/354/491/#p498\">\n    354 N.J.

Respondents\n   further argue the lack of a distinction between UM and UIM will either cause a policyholder to believe that UM coverage is not available, or will leave the policyholder confused as to when UM benefits apply.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-29\">\n   Respondents' arguments lack merit. This case does not involve UM coverage. Plaintiff did not present a claim for UM benefits, only UIM benefits. Whether the clause is ambiguous as to the UM benefits has no bearing on whether the clause is ambiguous in regards to UIM benefits.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-30\">\n   Additionally, we do not find the policy's definitions or lack of definitions of certain terms render it ambiguous. The policy excludes UIM coverage when an insured suffers injuries in a \"motor vehicle\" owned by the insured but not covered by the policy. Plaintiff asserts the failure to define \"motor vehicle\" results in an ambiguity as to the difference between \"autos\" and \"motor vehicles,\" despite the fact that the exclusion only uses the term \"motor vehicle.\" While GEICO could have included a definition of \"motor vehicle\" in its policy, if the words used in an exclusionary clause are clear and unambiguous, \"a court should not engage in a strained construction to support the imposition of liability.\"\n   <em>\n    Longobardi\n   </em>\n   ,\n   <extracted-citation case-ids=\"1367221\" index=\"18\" url=\"https://cite.case.law/nj/121/530/#p537\">\n    121 N.J. at 537\n   </extracted-citation>\n   ,\n   <extracted-citation case-ids=\"1367221\" index=\"19\" url=\"https://cite.case.law/nj/121/530/#p537\">\n    582 A.2d 1257\n   </extracted-citation>\n   .\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-31\">\n   The challenged exclusion explicitly states UIM coverage is not provided for an insured's injuries sustained in a motor vehicle owned by the insured but not covered by the policy. Any ordinary reasonable person understands a motorcycle is a type of motor vehicle. Of note, the legal definition of motor vehicle includes a motorcycle.\n   <em>\n    See\n   </em>\n   N.J.S.A. 39:1-1 (defining \"motor vehicle\" to include \"all vehicles propelled otherwise than by muscular power, excepting such vehicles as run only upon rails or tracks and motorized bicycles\").\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-32\">\n   In addition, plaintiff would have specifically understood that his motorcycle constituted a motor vehicle when he registered it with the State since the registration application calls for \"the name of the insurer of the vehicle and the policy number.\" N.J.S.A. 39:3-4\n   (requiring owners to register vehicles driven on public roadways, including motorcycles, and to obtain separate insurance).\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-33\">\n   Respondents also argue the exclusion in the policy is inconsistent with the intent and underlying policy of the UIM\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-34\">\n   statute because the policy's declaration page gave no warning of the exclusion and it improperly ties the UIM coverage to the insured vehicle rather than the insured person.

Because we do not find the language ambiguous, we need not consider plaintiff's claimed reasonable expectations.

According to the majority, therefore, if the car is not covered then the insured is not covered. The Department of Banking and Insurance Auto Insurance Buyers Guide does not reference any such nuanced type of exclusion for UIM.\n  </p>\n  <blockquote id=\"p-66\">\n   Underinsured Motorist Coverage pays\n   <em>\n    you\n   </em>\n   if you are in an auto accident caused by a driver who is insured, but who has less coverage than your underinsured motorist coverage. Damages greater than the limits of the other driver's policy are covered by your policy up to the difference between the limits of your underinsured motorist coverage and the other driver's policy limit.\n  </blockquote>\n  <blockquote id=\"p-67\">\n   [\n   <em>\n    New Jersey Auto Insurance Buyer's Guide\n   </em>\n   8 https://www.state.nj.us/dobi/division_consumers/pdf/autoguide02.pdf (last visited December 21, 2018) (emphasis added).]\n  </blockquote>\n  <p id=\"p-68\">\n   The Declarations page does not hint at an exclusion either.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-69\">\n   The majority attempts to provide examples to prove their point that UIM coverage will continue, after this opinion, to follow the person and not the vehicle. For instance, the majority implies coverage will still apply where the \"plaintiff suffered injuries while in a rental car or another vehicle he did not own\" or if plaintiff were \"struck by a vehicle while walking down the street.\" We are not tasked with interpreting this policy for factual situations that are not before us, but the exclusion in paragraph six of Section IV should be considered before assuming that coverage will continue to follow the insured. Exclusion six provides that coverage does not apply \"[t]o\n   <em>\n    bodily injury\n   </em>\n   sustained by an\n   <em>\n    insured\n   </em>\n   while\n   <em>\n    occupying\n   </em>\n   a motor vehicle not owned by, and furnished for the regular use of the\n   <em>\n    insured\n   </em>\n   when involved in an accident with an\n   <em>\n    underinsured motor vehicle\n   </em>\n   .\" This seems to exclude a plaintiff from UIM coverage in a vehicle he does not own.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-70\">\n   The majority opinion provides that \"whether the clause is ambiguous as to the UM benefits has no bearing on whether\n   the clause is ambiguous in regard to UIM benefits.\" This appears to concede that the policy exclusion in question would be construed as ambiguous if we were dealing with UM coverage, but is \"clear and unambiguous\" for UIM coverage. It is error to conclude that\n   the very same sentence in an exclusion is clear for one type of coverage and not for another. Respectfully, it is the same policy, the same sentence, and the same ambiguities.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-71\">\n   This is not a question of which UIM policy is primary or excess as referenced by the majority in its citation to\n   <em>\n    Royal Insurance Co. v. Rutgers Cas. Ins. Co.\n   </em>\n   ,\n   <extracted-citation case-ids=\"609756\" index=\"93\" url=\"https://cite.case.law/nj-super/271/409/#p419\">\n    271 N.J.

The question is whether the insured would understand from the Declarations page and policy provisions that UIM coverage was limited. As the Court stated in\n   <em>\n    Kievit v.
