(Employer).\n   <footnotemark>\n    1\n   </footnotemark>\n   Claimant petitions for review of the Board's Order that, in relevant part, modified a Workers' Compensation Judge's (WCJ) decision awarding Claimant ongoing workers' compensation (WC) benefits to reflect an award of benefits for a closed period between June 21, 2012, and August 14, 2012, and directed the recalculation of Claimant's average weekly wage (AWW). Employer petitions for review of the Board's Order, which reversed the WCJ's decision denying Claimant's Penalty Petition and awarded Claimant a 10-percent penalty.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-11\">\n   <strong>\n    I. Background\n   </strong>\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-12\">\n   <em>\n    A. Proceedings before the WCJ\n   </em>\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-13\">\n   Claimant, a union bricklayer, worked for Employer on various job sites, most recently in the Spring of 2012. In April 2012, while working for Employer, Claimant broke out into a rash on various parts of his body. He left work on April 16, 2012, and did not return at the instruction of his physician, Joel Laury, M.D. Dr. Laury diagnosed Claimant with allergic contact dermatitis arising from Claimant's long-term work exposure to chromium, which is found in bricks, concrete, and mortar. On\n   June 21, 2012, Claimant filed a Claim Petition and a Penalty Petition, alleging, respectively, that he suffered the above injury and that Employer violated the WC Act\n   <footnotemark>\n    2\n   </footnotemark>\n   (Act) by not timely accepting or denying liability for that injury. In addition to ongoing WC benefits and a penalty, Claimant sought attorneys' fees, alleging Employer's contest became unreasonable following a November 6, 2012 Independent Medical Examination (IME) that indicated Claimant's condition was work-related and he could not return to his position as a bricklayer. Employer filed answers denying the material allegations in the Petitions.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-14\">\n   The Petitions were consolidated, and the WCJ held hearings, at which Claimant testified as follows. Claimant began working as a bricklayer when he left high school, approximately 18 years prior to the December 4, 2012 hearing. (Reproduced Record (R.R.) at 21a.) Thus, he has worked as a bricklayer since approximately 1994. Claimant first experienced a rash in 2007 while working as a bricklayer for a different employer. Claimant sought treatment with his dermatologist in 2008, who did patch testing, which \"revealed that Claimant was allergic to nickel sulfate, potassium dichromate [ (chromium) ], balsam of Peru[,] and cobalt dichloride.\" (WCJ Decision, May 1, 2014, Finding of Fact (FOF) \u00b6 14.) When his position with that employer ended, Claimant began working for Employer in 2009, but was subject to layoffs when Employer did not have work for him. (R.R. at 34a-35a.) On his most recent layoff, Claimant did non-bricklaying work for a different employer until Employer recalled him. (\n   <em>\n    Id.\n   </em>\n   at 44a.)\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-15\">\n   While working as a bricklayer, Claimant continued to get the rash intermittently, with the symptoms worsening with each break out. In April 2012, while laying brick for Employer, he again developed a rash. After seeking treatment with Dr. Laury, Claimant informed Employer's foreman (Foreman) that his physician removed him from work due to the rash. Claimant did not recall specifically what he told Foreman regarding the cause of the rash. (\n   <em>\n    Id.\n   </em>\n   at 43a, 46a.) He continued to treat with Dr. Laury and has not returned to work. Claimant agreed that he was not working for another employer while working for Employer in April 2012. (\n   <em>\n    Id.\n   </em>\n   at 35a.) Claimant received unemployment compensation benefits when he stopped working in April 2012.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-16\">\n   Claimant presented the deposition of Dr. Laury, who is board-certified in allergies/immunology and internal medicine and with whom Claimant initially sought treatment for a rash in February 2009. Dr. Laury indicated that the medical records of Claimant's treating dermatologist reflected that, per prior diagnostic testing, Claimant had allergies to cobalt and chromium. (FOF \u00b6 14; R.R. at 103a-04a.) Dr. Laury explained that, \"[a]s a bricklayer, Claimant was regularly exposed to both cobalt and chromium in the course of [his] employment.\" (FOF \u00b6 14.) After Dr. Laury treated Claimant with oral steroids, Claimant's symptoms improved and Claimant returned for treatment only as needed. Claimant returned to Dr. Laury on April 19, 2012, with a rash on his forehead, hands, and legs. Claimant told Dr. Laury that the rash went away when he was not working. Based on the history provided by Claimant, Claimant's medical records, the results of Claimant's diagnostic tests, and his physical examination of Claimant, Dr. Laury opined \"that Claimant's symptoms were the result of occupational exposure\" and \"diagnosed Claimant with allergic contact dermatitis as a result of occupational\n   exposure to chromium.\" (\n   <em>\n    Id.\n   </em>\n   \u00b6 15.) Dr. Laury recommended that Claimant not return to work as a bricklayer, noting that Claimant's condition was worsening and he could not continue to take the prescribed systemic oral steroid without it having long-term effects on Claimant's health, some of which could be life threatening. (R.R. at 106a-07a, 109a, 135a.) Dr. Laury acknowledged that, as of his August 14, 2012 examination, Claimant's rash had \"cleared up.\" (\n   <em>\n    Id.\n   </em>\n   at 110a-11a.)\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-17\">\n   Claimant also introduced the IME physician's medical report, not to prove that he suffered a work-related injury as set forth in that report, but to support his claim that Employer's contest became unreasonable in November 2012. After performing the IME on November 6, 2012, the IME physician indicated in her medical report that Claimant had \"chromium induced occupational contact dermatitis, chronic and severe.\" (FOF \u00b6 16.) The medical report stated, \"Claimant's allergy to chromates would be permanent and that 'he absolutely cannot have a job as a bricklayer ever again.' \" (\n   <em>\n    Id.\n   </em>\n   (quoting R.R. at 175a).)\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-18\">\n   Employer did not present any medical evidence, but did present Foreman's testimony. Foreman explained Claimant began working for Employer in October 2009, Claimant would be temporarily laid off when Employer had little work, Claimant was eligible for unemployment compensation during these layoffs, and Claimant remained Employer's employee during these layoffs. (R.R. at 73a-75a.) Foreman was Claimant's supervisor and was aware Claimant had a rash. Claimant informed him on April 16, 2012, that Claimant would not be returning to work because of the rash issue, but he did not remember if Claimant stated that the rash was work-related. Foreman received a text message from Claimant on April 20, 2012, in which Claimant again stated he was not able to return to work. When Foreman subsequently spoke with Claimant, Claimant said \"he was allergic to 'most everything in the construction industry' and would probably need to find a different job.\" (FOF \u00b6 12 (quoting Hr'g Tr. at 14, R.R. at 71a).)\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-19\">\n   Employer also presented evidence regarding Claimant's wages with Employer, which supported an AWW of $682.37 and a corresponding compensation rate of $454.81. It also offered evidence of Claimant's receipt of unemployment compensation benefits in the net amount of $516 per week for weeks ending June 9, 2012, through March 8, 2013. Claimant challenged Employer's wage information by presenting, as evidence of his wages, copies of his tax returns for the years 2010 and 2011, which included $43,630 from Employer and $12,246 from a concurrent employer. Claimant also testified that, in his most recent work for Employer, he was earning $30.90 per hour for a 40-hour work week, resulting in a weekly wage of $1236. The WCJ accepted Claimant's evidence and found that Claimant's AWW was $1236.\n   <footnotemark>\n    3\n   </footnotemark>\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-20\">\n   After reviewing the evidence, the WCJ found Claimant's testimony credible and persuasive and found Foreman's testimony credible on the issue of when Employer received notice that Claimant's injury was work related. The WCJ credited Dr. Laury's testimony, observing Dr. Laury is\n   Claimant's treating physician and his opinions were supported by his multiple examinations of Claimant, diagnostic testing, and the evidence as a whole. While the WCJ noted the IME medical report was not offered or entered into evidence to prove that Claimant suffered a work-related injury, but to support Claimant's request for unreasonable contest attorneys' fees, the medical report \"unequivocally relate[d] Claimant's condition to his employment.\" (FOF \u00b6 28.) Based on these findings, the WCJ concluded Claimant met his burden of proof on the Claim Petition by \"establish[ing] the causal connection between Claimant's employment and the aggravation of Claimant's preexisting dermatitis which resulted in [his] removal from employment as a bricklayer as of April 19, 2012.\" (WCJ Decision, Conclusion of Law (COL) \u00b6 2.) The WCJ further held Claimant's \"work-related injury in the nature of allergic contact dermatitis\" \"rendered him incapable of returning to work as a bricklayer,\" and Employer did not present evidence that it had work available that would not require Claimant to be exposed to chromium. (\n   <em>\n    Id.\n   </em>\n   \u00b6 3.) According to the WCJ, Claimant gave Employer timely notice of the work injury, having filed the Claim Petition within the required 120-day notice period. Therefore, the WCJ granted the Claim Petition and directed Employer to pay Claimant WC benefits of $824 per week, based on an AWW of $1236, from April 16, 2012, forward with credit for the unemployment compensation benefits Claimant received. (WCJ Order, April 28, 2014.) The WCJ denied the Penalty Petition \"[u]pon [his] review of the evidence of record in its entirety.\"\n   <footnotemark>\n    4\n   </footnotemark>\n   (\n   <em>\n    Id.\n   </em>\n   )\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-21\">\n   <em>\n    B. The Board's September 10, 2015 Opinion\n   </em>\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-22\">\n   Both Employer and Claimant appealed to the Board. Employer first challenged the WCJ's award of ongoing benefits beginning April 16, 2012. It asserted, relevant here, that Claimant did not give it notice within 21 days of the injury; thus, his receipt of benefits could not begin until the date he gave notice. The Board concluded a remand on this issue was necessary. It observed that Section 311 of the Act, 77 P.S. \u00a7 631, requires a claimant to give notice of an injury within 120 days and provides that unless a claimant gives notice within 21 days after the injury, no compensation is due until notice is given. The Board noted a claimant's compliance with these notice requirements was a question of fact for the WCJ, but the WCJ did not make a finding regarding when Claimant advised Employer that his rash was work related. Accordingly, the Board remanded for the WCJ to do so and, if necessary, adjust the date from whence Claimant's WC benefits should begin.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-23\">\n   Employer further argued that Claimant had fully recovered from his work-related aggravation of the preexisting dermatitis as of August 14, 2012, and, therefore, ongoing benefits should not have been awarded. The Board agreed, citing\n   <em>\n    Bethlehem Steel Corporation v. Workers' Compensation Appeal Board (Baxter)\n   </em>\n   ,\n   <extracted-citation case-ids=\"281186\" index=\"0\" url=\"https://cite.case.law/pa/550/658/\">\n    550 Pa. 658\n   </extracted-citation>\n   ,\n   <extracted-citation case-ids=\"11820480,281186\" index=\"1\" url=\"https://cite.case.law/a2d/708/801/\">\n    708 A.2d 801\n   </extracted-citation>\n   (1998). The Board held that, under\n   <em>\n    Baxter\n   </em>\n   ,\n  </p>\n  <blockquote id=\"p-24\">\n   if exposure results in an ongoing disabling condition, benefits may continue; however, where no restrictions from the work-related injury exist, and only the threat of future recurrences prevents the claimant from performing [the] pre-injury\n   job, the claimant no longer is entitled to benefits when his condition returns to baseline. Like the claimant in\n   <em>\n    Baxter\n   </em>\n   , Claimant's injury was an aggravation injury and the medical evidence presented and accepted established that Claimant recovered from the work-related injury.\n  </blockquote>\n  <p id=\"p-25\">\n   (Board Opinion (Op.) at 10.) Because Dr. Laury did not testify to any ongoing or permanent work injury and agreed that Claimant had essentially recovered from the rash as of August 14, 2012, the Board held that Claimant had returned to his pre-injury baseline condition and his entitlement to benefits ended as of that date. Accordingly, the Board modified the WCJ's decision \"to reflect a termination of benefits as of August 14, 2012.\" (\n   <em>\n    Id.\n   </em>\n   at 11.)\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-26\">\n   Finally, Employer asserted the WCJ erred in finding that Claimant had concurrent employment and increasing Claimant's AWW based on that employment. Employer argued that because Claimant testified that he did not work for anyone else at the same time he was working for Employer, his AWW should have been calculated using his wages from \"the 4 completed 13-week periods immediately preceding the date of injury.\" (\n   <em>\n    Id.\n   </em>\n   ) The Board agreed that the WCJ's finding that Claimant had \"concurrent employment\" was not supported by Claimant's credited testimony and Claimant could not \"be deemed [as] hav[ing] had concurrent employers.\" (\n   <em>\n    Id.\n   </em>\n   at 12.) The Board, therefore, vacated the WCJ's calculation and remanded for a new calculation of Claimant's AWW and corresponding compensation rate in accordance with Section 309 of the Act, 77 P.S. \u00a7 582.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-27\">\n   In his appeal, Claimant argued the WCJ erred in denying the Penalty Petition. After reviewing the penalty provisions of the Act, Section 435 of the Act, 77 P.S. \u00a7 991,\n   <footnotemark>\n    5\n   </footnotemark>\n   and the Act's requirement that an employer timely investigate an injury, Section 406.1(a) of the Act, 77 P.S. \u00a7 717.1(a),\n   <footnotemark>\n    6\n   </footnotemark>\n   the Board observed that the WCJ had summarily denied the Penalty Petition without discussion. Because Section 422(a) of the Act, 77 P.S. \u00a7 834, required a reasoned decision on this issue, the Board remanded for a determination that would satisfy the reasoned decision requirements.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-28\">\n   <em>\n    C. The WCJ's Remand Decision\n   </em>\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-29\">\n   The WCJ issued a new decision addressing the issues remanded to him. First, with regard to notice, the WCJ found it was undisputed that Claimant advised Employer in April 2012 that he could not return to work due to his severe rash. However, the WCJ found Claimant did not inform Employer that this condition was related to his work with Employer at that time. Instead, the WCJ found Claimant later informed Foreman that the rash was due to his \"exposure to materials in the construction industry.\" (WCJ Remand Decision, Finding of Fact (Remand FOF) \u00b6 6.) The WCJ found that this statement did not place Employer on notice that the rash was related to Claimant's work for Employer because Claimant had worked for other employers in the construction industry. On this basis, the WCJ found that, for the purpose of Section 311 of the Act, Employer received notice of Claimant's injury on June 21, 2012, the date Claimant filed the Claim Petition.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-30\">\n   Second, with regard to Claimant's AWW, the WCJ reviewed the evidence regarding Claimant's wages from the last 4 completed 13-week periods of employment with Employer, without considering any alleged concurrent employment. Based only on the evidence related to Claimant's\n   work for Employer during those periods, the WCJ added Claimant's highest three quarters and divided that number by three, resulting in an AWW of $728.38 with a compensation rate of $485.58.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-31\">\n   Finally, in addressing the Penalty Petition, the WCJ noted that Claimant bore the burden of proving a violation of the Act and the asserted violation here was that Employer failed to timely accept or deny liability for Claimant's injury. The WCJ held, however, that Employer's obligation to do so arose only after it received notice of the injury. Because notice was not received until Claimant filed the Claim Petition in June 2012 and Employer filed a timely answer denying the pertinent allegations and had Claimant submit to an IME, the WCJ concluded Claimant did not establish Employer's violation of the Act and denied the Penalty Petition.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-32\">\n   <em>\n    D. The Board's January 12, 2018 Opinion\n   </em>\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-33\">\n   Claimant appealed the WCJ's remand decision to the Board, arguing the WCJ erred in terminating his benefits as of August 14, 2012, and in recalculating Claimant's AWW, because Claimant continued to disagree with the Board's prior decision. Noting that the Board had addressed these issues in its prior opinion, the Board declined to revisit those determinations, while acknowledging that Claimant had preserved those issues for further appeal purposes.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-34\">\n   Claimant also challenged the WCJ's conclusion that Employer did not violate the Act by virtue of its late response and by not issuing a notice of compensation payable (NCP) once the IME physician found that a work-related injury had occurred. The Board concluded that, pursuant to Section 406.1, Employer was required to promptly investigate Claimant's injury and begin making payments \"not later than the twenty-first day after [it] ha[d] notice or knowledge of\" Claimant's disability, or, if it disputed the right to compensation, to promptly notify Claimant of its decision. 77 P.S. \u00a7 717.1(a), (c) ;\n   <em>\n    see also\n   </em>\n   <extracted-citation index=\"2\" url=\"https://cite.case.law/citations/?q=34%20Pa.%20Code%20%C2%A7%20121.13\">\n    34 Pa. Code \u00a7 121.13\n   </extracted-citation>\n   . The failure of Employer to issue the appropriate document within 21 days of receiving notice of a work injury is a technical violation of the Act.\n   <em>\n    Johnstown Hous. Auth. v. Workers' Comp. Appeal Bd. (Lewis)\n   </em>\n   ,\n   <extracted-citation case-ids=\"9036457\" index=\"3\" url=\"https://cite.case.law/a2d/865/999/#p1004\">\n    865 A.2d 999\n   </extracted-citation>\n   , 1004 (Pa. Cmwlth. 2005). The Board found no authority to support the WCJ's conclusion that, because Employer filed an answer denying the Claim Petition's allegations, Employer was excused from its obligations under Section 406.1. Although the amount of penalties is generally within the discretion of the WCJ, the Board found a 10-percent penalty was, as a matter of law, appropriate under Section 435(d) due to Employer's technical violation of the Act. Accordingly, the Board reversed the WCJ's denial of the Penalty Petition and awarded Claimant a 10-percent penalty, and reaffirmed its prior determinations regarding the termination of Claimant's benefits and calculation of Claimant's AWW.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-35\">\n   Both Claimant and Employer petition this Court for review.\n   <footnotemark>\n    7\n   </footnotemark>\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-36\">\n   <strong>\n    II. Appeal to this Court\n   </strong>\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-37\">\n   Claimant raises two arguments before this Court. First, he argues his WC benefits should not have been terminated as of August 14, 2012, because he established his entitlement to ongoing WC benefits\n   notwithstanding the cessation of the symptoms associated with his work-related chromium allergy. Second, he asserts his AWW was miscalculated and that wages from his work with a different employer while he was laid off should have been considered concurrent employment in order to reflect his economic reality. Employer raises one argument, which is that the amount of a penalty is a matter for the WCJ and the Board's\n   <em>\n    sua sponte\n   </em>\n   imposition of the 10-percent penalty improperly infringed upon the WCJ's discretion.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-38\">\n   <em>\n    A. The Termination of Claimant's Benefits\n   </em>\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-39\">\n   <em>\n    1.\n   </em>\n   <em>\n    The Parties' Arguments\n   </em>\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-40\">\n   Claimant argues the Board erred in terminating his benefits as of August 14, 2012, because he did not suffer from a preexisting condition and had no work-related medical restrictions at the time he developed his chromium allergy. Rather, he maintains, the medical evidence establishes that his underlying allergy to chromium was the result of his prolonged exposure to that substance in the course and scope of his work, and this allergy, which manifests as contact dermatitis, prevents him from ever working as a bricklayer again. Claimant argues that Dr. Laury and the IME physician both opined that he could never return to work as a bricklayer due to the risk of chromium exposure, and, therefore, he has suffered a loss of earnings due to his work-related injury. Although his allergy initially manifested during his work for a previous employer, he was able to continue working as long as he wore gloves and other safety equipment. However, during his time working for Employer, his injury progressed and he is no longer able to work at all. The fact that he is asymptomatic when he is not exposed to chromium does not preclude the receipt of ongoing WC benefits because his condition will recur, and continue to become more dangerous, when he is again exposed at work. In other words, according to Claimant, his work injury has become disabling because he can now no longer perform the job that he had been able to perform when he started his employment with Employer. Thus, he has not returned to the condition he was in when he began working for Employer, and he should not have to continue to expose himself to a substance that is toxic to him, in order to be eligible for benefits. Claimant argues that our Supreme Court's opinions in\n   <em>\n    Lash v. Workmen's Compensation Appeal Board (General Battery Corporation)\n   </em>\n   ,\n   <extracted-citation case-ids=\"1765610\" index=\"4\" url=\"https://cite.case.law/pa/491/294/\">\n    491 Pa. 294\n   </extracted-citation>\n   ,\n   <extracted-citation case-ids=\"1765610\" index=\"5\" url=\"https://cite.case.law/pa/491/294/\">\n    420 A.2d 1325\n   </extracted-citation>\n   (1980), and\n   <em>\n    Farquhar v.

Employer argues Claimant's chromium allergy, diagnosed in 2008, is a preexisting condition that was not caused by his work for Employer, which did not begin until 2009. It began when he worked for a previous employer. The aggravation of this work injury he experienced while working for Employer was resolved, and he returned to his baseline condition on August 14, 2012, when he stopped working. Then, the compensable injury ended, and his entitlement to WC benefits ceased. Here, Claimant's work-related condition was caused by his work for a previous employer. Therefore, the cases that Claimant relies upon are inapplicable, because in those cases, the condition was caused by the claimants' employment with the employer against whom the claims were being filed. Employer argues the Board correctly terminated\n   Claimant's benefits based on\n   <em>\n    Baxter\n   </em>\n   as of August 14, 2012.\n   <footnotemark>\n    8\n   </footnotemark>\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-42\">\n   <em>\n    2.\n   </em>\n   <em>\n    Discussion\n   </em>\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-43\">\n   In a claim petition proceeding, the claimant bears the burden of establishing all of the elements necessary to support an award of WC benefits, including the existence of an injury and disability, and a causal relationship between the injury and the claimant's work.\n   <em>\n    Giant Eagle, Inc. v.

After she received WC benefits for that injury, she returned to work at the same position and experienced a flare up of her thrombosis. The claimant's physician told her not to perform the strenuous work duties again and that she was permanently unfit to perform those duties. Following her discharge for refusing to follow the employer's directive that she perform those strenuous duties, the claimant sought the reinstatement of her WC benefits.

Because there had been no ongoing changes, the Supreme Court held that once the claimant had fully recovered from the work-related aggravation of his preexisting, non-work-related asthma and his condition returned to its baseline, the claimant was ineligible for benefits because his disability was no longer related to the conditions of his workplace.\n   <em>\n    <extracted-citation case-ids=\"11820480,281186\" index=\"26\" url=\"https://cite.case.law/a2d/708/801/\">\n     Id.\n    </extracted-citation>\n   </em>\n   To hold otherwise, the Supreme Court reasoned, would \"undermine[ ] the principles of the [WC] Act [by] impos[ing] liability on an employer for the existence of a condition present from childhood when\n   <strong>\n    no residual work-related injury is demonstrated\n   </strong>\n   .\"\n   <em>\n    <extracted-citation case-ids=\"11820480,281186\" index=\"27\" url=\"https://cite.case.law/a2d/708/801/\">\n     Id.\n    </extracted-citation>\n   </em>\n   (emphasis added).\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-50\">\n   Unlike the claimant's asthma in\n   <em>\n    Baxter,\n   </em>\n   which was not work-related but developed while that claimant was a child, Claimant's severe allergy to chromium was caused by his long-term exposure to chromium working as a bricklayer. Thus, Claimant has a work-related condition. Because Claimant here worked as a bricklayer for a prior employer, during which time his allergy manifested, Employer argues that the allergy is a preexisting condition that merely was aggravated by his work for Employer. Employer argues\n   <em>\n    Baxter\n   </em>\n   applies and Claimant should not receive ongoing benefits because Claimant, having become asymptomatic as of August 14, 2012, had returned to his baseline condition. However, Claimant was able to perform the bricklaying job when he started\n   working for Employer. While he did have to use gloves, and eventually started taking systemic steroids to control his symptoms, his condition has now progressed and worsened such that it is not safe for him to continue to do so. (Dr. Laury's Dep. at 43, R.R. at 107a, 109a-10a, 135a.) Both Dr. Laury and the IME doctor have credibly opined that Claimant has an allergy to chromium due to his long-term work exposure to that substance, which the IME doctor described as \"chronic and severe\" and \"permanent,\" and that \" 'he absolutely cannot have a job as a bricklayer ever again.' \" (FOF \u00b6\u00b6 14-16 (quoting IME physician's medical report at 2, R.R. at 175a); R.R. at 103a-04a, 113a-14a.) Dr. Laury agreed with the IME doctor's observations. (R.R. at 114a.) Under these circumstances, we cannot conclude that Claimant's condition has returned to its baseline.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-51\">\n   Claimant's current restriction from working as a bricklayer is a result of his continued exposure to chromium, which occurred while working for Employer.

The decision to impose a penalty falls within the discretion of the WCJ and, here, Employer asserts, the WCJ found, based on the credible testimony of Foreman, that Employer's timely filed answer denying that Claimant suffered from a work-related injury and promptly scheduled IME provided Claimant with notice that Employer was denying his claim. According to Employer, issuing a Notice of Compensation Denial (NCD), the lack of which the Board found was a \"technical violation of the Act,\" would simply have reiterated what it stated in its timely answer.

Based on these facts, Employer argues, the WCJ exercised his discretion to determine that no penalty was warranted, and the Board erred by usurping that discretion.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-76\">\n   Claimant responds it is well-settled that an employer's failure to timely issue the appropriate WC Bureau document accepting or denying an alleged work injury is a violation of the Act and should result in an award of penalties.

Employer's refusal to acknowledge its liability, Claimant maintains, continued for months after the IME, and reflects Employer's decision not to comply with the Act notwithstanding it being apparent that Claimant had sustained a disabling work-related injury.

Having reversed the termination of Claimant's benefits as of August 14, 2012, the WCJ will have to consider whether a technical violation of the Act warrants the imposition of a penalty on what is now an award of ongoing benefits.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-84\">\n   <strong>\n    III. Conclusion\n   </strong>\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-85\">\n   For the foregoing reasons, we find that Claimant is entitled to ongoing benefits, and therefore we reverse that part of the Board's Order affirming the termination of Claimant's WC benefits as of August 14, 2012. We affirm that part of the Board's Order affirming the calculation of Claimant's AWW as $728.38, and that part of the Board's Order reversing the denial of the Penalty Petition. However, we must vacate the award of a 10-percent penalty and remand the matter to allow the WCJ to exercise his discretion on whether to award a penalty based on Employer's technical violation of the Act.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-86\">\n   <strong>\n    <em>\n     ORDER\n    </em>\n   </strong>\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-87\">\n   <strong>\n    NOW\n   </strong>\n   , January 18, 2019, the Order of Workers' Compensation Appeal Board (Board) entered in the above-captioned matter is\n   <strong>\n    REVERSED\n   </strong>\n   to the extent it affirmed the termination of Thomas Kurpiewski's\n   (Claimant) workers' compensation benefits as of August 14, 2012,\n   <strong>\n    AFFIRMED\n   </strong>\n   to the extent it affirmed the calculation of Claimant's average weekly wage as $728.38, and\n   <strong>\n    AFFIRMED\n   </strong>\n   to the extent it reversed the denial of Claimant's Penalty Petition. The imposition of a 10-percent penalty is\n   <strong>\n    VACATED\n   </strong>\n   , and the matter is\n   <strong>\n    REMANDED\n   </strong>\n   for further proceedings consistent with the foregoing opinion.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-88\">\n   Jurisdiction relinquished.\n  </p>\n  <footnote label=\"1\">\n   <p id=\"p-91\">\n    The petitions for review were consolidated by this Court.\n   </p>\n  </footnote>\n  <footnote label=\"2\">\n   <p id=\"p-92\">\n    Act of June 2, 1915, P.L. 736,\n    <em>\n     as amended\n    </em>\n    , 77 P.S. \u00a7\u00a7 1 - 1041.4, 2501 -2708.\n   </p>\n  </footnote>\n  <footnote label=\"3\">\n   <p id=\"p-93\">\n    In finding that Claimant's AWW was $1236, the WCJ apparently multiplied Claimant's most recent hourly wage by the number of hours Claimant was expected to work on the current project for Employer.
