On appeal, the defendant claims that (1) \"[t]he evidence supports a finding that ... \u00a7 22-357 does not apply as the dog's conduct was innocent,\" and (2) \"[t]he evidence does not support a finding of proximate cause.\" We affirm the judgment of the trial court.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-10\">\n   On the basis of the evidence presented at trial, the trial court found the following facts, which it set forth in a July 18, 2017 memorandum of decision. \"On April 14, 2013, the plaintiff, who worked as a personal care assistant to elderly and disabled people, was carrying certain items into a motel room in East Hartford from a motor vehicle. The defendant, who was a long distance truck driver, was playing fetch with his dog on a grassy area next to the motel building. The defendant's dog was a one year old medium-sized Labradoodle named Lilly, with whom the defendant sometimes traveled. At the end of their exercise, the defendant and Lilly intended to return to the motel room where they were staying. Lilly, with no leash attached, bounded toward the motel ahead of the defendant.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-11\">\n   \"The plaintiff saw Lilly coming, became startled and frightened, and tripped and fell as she tried to avoid the dog's advance. Lilly never actually made physical contact with the plaintiff, but came close and stood over the plaintiff as the plaintiff lay on the ground.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-12\">\n   \"The defendant attempted to help the plaintiff up off the ground but words were exchanged about the presence of the dog. The defendant put Lilly in his motel room, away from the plaintiff, and helpfully called 911 for an ambulance.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-13\">\n   \"It was obvious that the plaintiff was injured. She had fallen backwards with her right arm and wrist under her body as she landed. The plaintiff was in great pain. She was taken by ambulance to Manchester Memorial Hospital where she was examined, x-rayed, and treated.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-14\">\n   Her right wrist was fractured in two places. The plaintiff was discharged from the hospital with a cast on her right wrist.\"\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-15\">\n   The court further found \"that the exuberant, unleashed Lilly was a proximate cause of the plaintiff falling and injuring herself. There is no dispute that the defendant was, and still is, the owner and keeper of the dog. The court finds that the plaintiff has met her burden of proving all of the essential elements of a claim for damages under ... \u00a7 22-357.\" Thereafter, on the basis of the evidence submitted on the question of damages the court entered the following damages award, subject to any applicable collateral source reduction: \"[F]or physical and emotional pain and suffering, for loss of use of right hand and wrist for a temporary period during treatment and rehabilitation, and for current 8 [percent] permanent partial impairment\n   which the court finds is related to this incident. Total: $ 45,000.\" This appeal followed.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-16\">\n   The defendant claims that (1) \"[t]he evidence supports a finding that ... \u00a7 22-357 does not apply as the dog's conduct was innocent,\" and (2) \"[t]he evidence does not support a finding of proximate cause.\" We are not persuaded.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-17\">\n   We first address our standard of review. The defendant contends that \"the standard of review in this case is limited to the standard of plain error.\" We disagree with this assertion and conclude that the plain error doctrine is not implicated in this case.\n   <footnotemark>\n    2\n   </footnotemark>\n   Rather, the\n   defendant's claims involve a challenge to the court's factual findings. Accordingly, we review the defendant's claims under the clearly erroneous standard of review.\n   <footnotemark>\n    3\n   </footnotemark>\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-18\">\n   \"On appeal, it is the function of this court to determine whether the decision of the trial court is clearly erroneous.... This involves a two part function: where the legal conclusions of the court are challenged, we must determine whether they are legally and logically correct and whether they find support in the facts set out in the memorandum of decision; where the factual basis of the court's decision is challenged we must determine whether the facts set out in the memorandum of decision are supported by the evidence or whether, in light of the evidence and the pleadings in the whole record, those facts are clearly erroneous.... In a case tried before a court, the trial judge is the sole arbiter of the credibility of the witnesses and the weight to be given specific testimony.... On appeal, we will give the evidence the most favorable reasonable construction in support of the verdict to which it is entitled....

He argues that under\n   <em>\n    Atkinson\n   </em>\n   v.\n   <em>\n    Santore\n   </em>\n   ,\n   <extracted-citation case-ids=\"6778957\" index=\"8\" url=\"https://cite.case.law/conn-app/135/76/#p78\">\n    135 Conn.

We conclude that the court properly applied \u00a7 22-357 to the facts of this case. Although the court did not use the word mischievous or vicious in describing the dog's behavior, it found that the \"exuberant\" dog \"bounded\" toward the motel, where the plaintiff was removing things from her vehicle, which frightened the plaintiff. Accordingly, it implicitly found that the dog's actions were not passive, innocent or involuntary.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-23\">\n   Merriam-Webster's Collegiate Dictionary (10th Ed. 2001) defines \"mischievous\" as: \"Harmful, injurious ... able or tending to cause annoyance, trouble, or minor injury ... irresponsibly playful ....\" The fact that the unleashed dog bounded toward her in an exuberant manner fits within the definition of mischievous. Accordingly, the defendant's claim that the dog's actions were innocent is without merit.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-24\">\n   The defendant's second claim contests the court's finding on the element of proximate cause, which we also review under the clearly erroneous standard.

The plaintiff saw Lilly coming, became startled and frightened, and tripped and fell as she tried to avoid the dog's advance. Lilly never actually made physical contact with the plaintiff, but came close and stood over the plaintiff as the plaintiff lay on the ground.\"\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-30\">\n   The plaintiff testified that as she was getting things out of her vehicle to bring into her daughter's motel room, which was approximately four feet from the vehicle, she saw the defendant and his unleashed dog across the yard. She further testified that the dog then \"start[ed] galloping. Coming, coming, coming towards me. So [she] was coming. I was scared. So I was trying to turn and run, and that's when I fell on my hand on the ground. And the dog ... came over to me.\" The plaintiff was afraid that the dog was going to bite her as she quickly ran toward her. She then indicated that the dog charging toward her was what caused her to fall.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-31\">\n   The plaintiff was asked if she had spoken with the East Hartford Police Department about the incident. She responded that she had spoken with them and informed them that \"the dog was charging at me, and I was scared, and I was trying to run and I tripped and fell. And [the officer] asked me [if] the dog [was] on a leash, and I said no.\" She then indicated that she fell backward while trying to avoid the dog. The plaintiff was asked by her attorney whether the dog could have been going someplace else. The plaintiff responded: \"No, [she] was coming. [She] was coming straight where I was, and when I was on the ground, [she] was right there.\" She also testified that after she fell to the ground, the dog \"came close to me.... The only thing [was that the dog] just was over me.\"\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-32\">\n   On the basis of this evidence, the court reasonably could have found that the dog\n   charging toward the\n   plaintiff set in motion a chain of events that brought about her injuries.
