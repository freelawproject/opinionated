We reverse and remand.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-10\">\n   On November 5, 2015, Pennsylvania State Police Trooper Jason Kaczor followed Appellee's vehicle for a span of five miles on Interstate 83 in York County. Trooper Kaczor stopped Appellee because he believed he observed Appellee's vehicle cross the fog line multiple times. Dash cam video from Trooper Kaczor's police cruiser failed to confirm that Appellee crossed the fog line. Additionally, Trooper Kaczor used his vehicle's speedometer to clock Appellee at 70 miles per hour in a 55-mile-per-hour zone over a span of four miles, in violation of 75 Pa.C.S.A. \u00a7 3362(a)(2).\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-11\">\n   Appellee's vehicle contained a quantity marijuana, including a partially burned cigar and several unburned cigars. The Commonwealth charged Appellee with, among other things, possession of a small amount of marijuana for personal use, possession of drug paraphernalia, and driving under the influence of a controlled substance.\n   <footnotemark>\n    1\n   </footnotemark>\n   After the trial court granted Appellee's motion to suppress the drugs and paraphernalia because of an unlawful vehicle stop, the Commonwealth filed a timely appeal.\n   <footnotemark>\n    2\n   </footnotemark>\n   A three-judge panel of this court affirmed the order on August 2, 2017. Subsequently, we granted reargument\n   <em>\n    en banc\n   </em>\n   and withdrew the prior memorandum. The Commonwealth presents the following questions:\n  </p>\n  <blockquote id=\"p-12\">\n   1. Did the lower court err in granting [Appellee's] motion to suppress when the trooper had probable cause to effectuate a traffic stop where uncontradicted evidence showed that the trooper clocked [Appellee] driving at a rate of speed of 70 miles per hour in a 55 mile per hour zone and the trial court credited this evidence?\n  </blockquote>\n  <blockquote id=\"p-13\">\n   2. Did sufficient probable cause exist to arrest [Appellee] for DUI where the trooper smelled burnt marijuana emanating from [Appellee's] car, [Appellee] was the sole occupant of the vehicle, and [Appellee] displayed other classic indicia of impairment?\n  </blockquote>\n  <p id=\"p-14\">\n   Commonwealth's Brief at 4.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-15\">\n   On review from an order suppressing evidence, we \"consider only the evidence from the defendant's witnesses together with the evidence of the prosecution that, when read in the context of the entire record, remains uncontradicted.\"\n   <strong>\n    <em>\n     Commonwealth v.

As we already noted uncontradicted evidence indicates that Trooper Kaczor observed Appellee's vehicle travelling 70 miles per hour in a 55 mile-per-hour zone. Trooper Kaczor therefore had probable cause to stop Appellee for speeding.\n   <footnotemark>\n    3\n   </footnotemark>\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-16\">\n   Trooper Kaczor testified that he stopped Appellee for crossing the fog line, not for speeding. The trial court found the stop to be unlawful because: (1) Trooper Kaczor testified that he stopped Appellee for swerving, (2) the officer's account of the swerving was not credible, and (3) the fact the officer did not activate his lights to initiate the stop led the trial court to conclude that speeding was not the legal basis for the stop. Trial Court Opinion, 5/6/16, at 4-5. For the reasons that follow, we conclude the trial court erred in deciding the suppression motion based on what it perceived to be Trooper Kaczor's subjective reason for effecting the vehicle stop.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-17\">\n   The proper analysis, when considering whether a police officer's actions violated the Fourth Amendment to the United States Constitution, is an objective one.

The Majority states the suppression transcript does not reflect a finding that Trooper Kaczor's testimony was not credible. As such, the Majority assumes Trooper Kaczor's credibility without a determination by the trial court. In my view, that assumption is mistaken. The trial court did\n   <em>\n    not\n   </em>\n   credit Trooper Kaczor's testimony that his speedometer showed Johnson was driving 70 miles per hour in a 55 mile per hour zone.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-42\">\n   In\n   <strong>\n    <em>\n     Commonwealth v.

Neither of these violations of the Vehicle Code required further investigation. Accordingly, in order to effectuate a legal stop of Johnson's vehicle, Trooper Kaczor required probable cause.\n   <strong>\n    <em>\n     See\n    </em>\n   </strong>\n   <strong>\n    <em>\n     Commonwealth v.

Suppression Hearing, 5/4/16, at 6. He further testified that while following Johnson's car for about four miles, he \"clocked it with [his] patrol unit, which is certified, going 70 in a 55 mile[ ] per hour zone.\"\n   <strong>\n    <em>\n     Id.\n    </em>\n   </strong>\n   At that point, he and Trooper Kabacinski, who was riding with him, decided to initiate a traffic stop.\n   <strong>\n    <em>\n     Id.\n    </em>\n   </strong>\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-48\">\n   When questioned on cross-examination, however, Trooper Kaczor acknowledged that he had nothing to prove that his speedometer was actually certified.\n   <strong>\n    <em>\n     Id.\n    </em>\n   </strong>\n   at 11.\n   <footnotemark>\n    1\n   </footnotemark>\n   Further, Trooper Kaczor could not recall how far Johnson's wheels went over the fog line.\n   <strong>\n    <em>\n     Id.\n    </em>\n   </strong>\n   at 14.

Contrary to the Majority's statement that because Johnson was speeding, there was probable cause, regardless of the Trooper Kaczor's state of mind, Johnson's speed was not the legal basis for Trooper Kaczor's stop. He did not initially communicate to his partner that he was pulling Johnson over for speeding and he did not activate his lights when he observed Johnson exceed the speed limit.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-50\">\n   The trial court viewed the dash cam video and determined that it did not bear out any of the trooper's testimony. Trial Court Opinion, 5/6/16, at 5.

I note that the Commonwealth argues that the trial court \"credited\" the \"evidence\" that \"the trooper clocked [Johnson] driving at a rate of speed of 70 miles per hour in a 55 mile per house zone[.]\" Commonwealth's Brief, at 4, 10, 14-17. The Commonwealth avers, therefore, that it logically follows that the trooper had probable cause to stop Johnson's vehicle for speeding. I disagree, not with the proposed legal conclusion, but with the Commonwealth's assertion that the court credited the trooper's statement as true. The court acknowledged that the trooper testified to this, but the court repeatedly did not find that this was the basis of the stop. The court stated:\n  </p>\n  <blockquote id=\"p-52\">\n   In reviewing the video recording of the vehicle stop from Trooper Kaczor's patrol car,\n   <em>\n    this Court did not find evidence that Trooper Kaczor initially communicated to [Johnson] that he was being pulled over for exceeding the speed limit\n   </em>\n   .
