The defendant appeals from orders of the Superior Court denying its Motion to Stay Litigation in Favor of Arbitration pursuant to G.L. 1956 \u00a7 10-3-3. These consolidated appeals came before the Supreme Court pursuant to an order directing the parties to appear and show cause why the issues raised in this appeal should not summarily be decided. After hearing the arguments of counsel and examining the memoranda filed on behalf of the parties, we conclude that cause has not been shown and that this case may be decided without further briefing or argument. For the reasons set forth in this opinion, we vacate the order of the Superior Court and remand the case to the Superior Court for entry of an order staying litigation pending arbitration proceedings.\n </opinion>\n <opinion id=\"p-7\">\n  <strong>\n   I\n  </strong>\n </opinion>\n <judges id=\"p-8\">\n  <strong>\n   Facts and Travel\n  </strong>\n </judges>\n <summary id=\"p-9\">\n  In 2005, the University of Rhode Island and the Rhode Island Board of Governors for Higher Education\n  <footnotemark>\n   1\n  </footnotemark>\n  agreed to lease a parcel of land on the Kingston campus of the University of Rhode Island to the Hellenic Society Paideia - Rhode Island Chapter (the Society or defendant) for the purpose of building and maintaining a Center for Hellenic Studies, which also was to house the Hellenic Studies Program at the University and the University of Rhode Island Center for Humanities. The initial term of the Lease was for ninety-nine years following completion of the building, and the Lease gave defendant the option to extend the initial Lease term for four additional ninety-nine year terms.\n  <footnotemark>\n   2\n  </footnotemark>\n </summary>\n <attorneys id=\"p-10\">\n  Although excavation was completed and a foundation was laid, construction of the building was halted in 2012 and, for reasons outside the scope of this appeal, construction was never recommenced. In November 2012, plaintiffs sent a Notice of Default and Termination of Ground Lease to the Society, advising it of plaintiffs' intent to terminate the Lease because construction had not been completed within thirty months of the commencement of construction, as required by the Lease. In June 2013, plaintiffs sent another letter to\n  the Society, demanding that defendant restore the property to its former condition.\n </attorneys>\n <opinion id=\"p-11\">\n  After years of back and forth between the parties, plaintiffs brought a petition in the Superior Court to appoint a special master to resolve the issues between the parties in relation to the failed project. Plaintiffs soon thereafter filed a first amended complaint seeking,\n  <em>\n   inter alia\n  </em>\n  , a declaratory judgment that defendant was in breach of the Lease. The amended complaint also sought an order directing defendant to restore the premises to its former condition or, in the alternative, to require defendant to reimburse plaintiffs for doing so themselves. While the case was in its early stages, defendant moved for a stay of litigation pursuant to \u00a7 10-3-3, arguing that Section 14.3 of the Lease, entitled \"Conciliation; Arbitration,\" required that all disputes be resolved by arbitration. The hearing justice ruled, for reasons discussed in more detail below, that the language of that provision did not mandate arbitration in this case, and consequently he denied defendant's motion for a stay of the litigation. The hearing justice later reaffirmed that ruling after defendant moved for reconsideration of the order denying the motion for a stay.\n  <footnotemark>\n   3\n  </footnotemark>\n </opinion>\n <footnote label=\"1\">\n  <p id=\"p-69\">\n   The Rhode Island Council on Postsecondary Education is the statutory successor to the Rhode Island Board of Governors for Higher Education and is a public corporation that holds \"legal title (in trust for the state) to all property, real and personal,\" owned by and/or under control of the University of Rhode Island and other public colleges in the state.

The plaintiffs argue, however, that orders denying a motion to stay litigation, although brought pursuant to \u00a7 10-3-3, deny by their very nature the existence of an issue \"referable to arbitration\" and that, in the absence of an arbitrable issue, the Arbitration Act as a whole, including \u00a7 10-3-19, simply does not apply. Thus, plaintiffs submit, an order\n   <em>\n    denying\n   </em>\n   a motion to stay litigation pending arbitration is not final and is reviewable only by writ of certiorari.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-22\">\n   Significantly, \u00a7 10-3-19 provides that \"[a]ny party aggrieved by any ruling or order\" as authorized in chapter 3 of title 10 of the General Laws \"may obtain review as in any civil action, and upon the entry of any final order provided in \u00a7 10-3-3 * * * he or she may appeal to the supreme court as provided for appeals in civil actions[.]\" By specifying that \"\n   <em>\n    any\n   </em>\n   party\" may bring a direct appeal if aggrieved by \"\n   <em>\n    any\n   </em>\n   ruling\" authorized by chapter 3 of title 10, the General Assembly clearly intended to permit direct appeals from orders both granting and denying motions to stay brought pursuant to \u00a7 10-3-3.

We conclude that a party who has sought a stay on the basis of an arbitrable issue is certainly aggrieved by an order denying the existence of such an issue and that such an order is final in nature. Therefore, it is our opinion that a party aggrieved by an order denying a motion to stay litigation brought pursuant to \u00a7 10-3-3 may appeal as of right from that order, pursuant to \u00a7 10-3-19.\n   <footnotemark>\n    4\n   </footnotemark>\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-23\">\n   <strong>\n    B\n   </strong>\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-24\">\n   <strong>\n    The Arbitrable Issue\n   </strong>\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-25\">\n   We turn now to the meat of the issue-whether the parties \"agree[d] to arbitration in clear and unequivocal language[.]\"\n   <em>\n    Rhode Island Brotherhood of Correctional Officers\n   </em>\n   ,\n   <extracted-citation case-ids=\"9040996\" index=\"9\" url=\"https://cite.case.law/a2d/866/1241/#p1247\">\n    866 A.2d at 1247\n   </extracted-citation>\n   . The defendant argues that the parties explicitly agreed to refer any dispute arising from an alleged breach of the Lease to arbitration, and defendant relies in support of this argument on a provision entitled \"Conciliation; Arbitration.\" The relevant language is as follows:\n  </p>\n  <blockquote id=\"p-26\">\n   \"14.3\n   <em>\n    Conciliation; Arbitration\n   </em>\n   .\n  </blockquote>\n  <blockquote id=\"p-27\">\n   \"14.3.1\n   <em>\n    Conciliation\n   </em>\n   In the event of any controversy, claim or dispute arising out of or relating to this Lease or with respect to any breach hereof, the parties shall seek to resolve the matter amicably through mutual discussions * * *.\n  </blockquote>\n  <blockquote id=\"p-28\">\n   \"14.3.2\n   <em>\n    Arbitration\n   </em>\n   - If the parties fail to resolve any such controversy, claim or dispute by amicable arrangement and compromise within the thirty (30) day\n   period immediately following the date of the notice initiating such discussions referred to in subsection (a) [\n   <em>\n    sic\n   </em>\n   ] above * * * the aggrieved party shall submit the controversy, claim or dispute to arbitration * * *.\"\n  </blockquote>\n  <p id=\"p-29\">\n   <strong>\n    1\n   </strong>\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-30\">\n   <strong>\n    The Arbitration Clause\n   </strong>\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-31\">\n   The underpinning of the hearing justice's bench decision was what he referred to as \"a conspicuous difference\" between the language of the conciliation clause in Section 14.3.1 and that of the arbitration clause in Section 14.3.2. He pointed out that the conciliation clause referred to \"any controversy, claim or dispute arising out of or relating to this Lease or with respect to any breach hereof[.]\" He noted that, on the other hand, the arbitration clause omits the language \"with respect to any breach hereof.\" The consequence of this difference, he ruled, was a limitation in the scope of the arbitration clause. In other words, the hearing justice reasoned that, because the arbitration clause omitted the words \"with respect to any breach hereof,\" the parties did not intend to arbitrate issues involving a breach of the Lease.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-32\">\n   To reach this conclusion, the hearing justice applied the canon of construction known as the \"specific-over-general\" rule. That canon applies when two statutory or contractual provisions cannot be reasonably construed to avoid a conflict between them.\n   <em>\n    See\n   </em>\n   <em>\n    Park v.

The hearing justice believed that the absence of the words \"with respect to any breach hereof\" in the arbitration clause created a conflict with the conciliation clause, and, applying the specific-over-general rule, he ruled that \"in order for there to be arbitration, there had to be [a] controversy, claim, or dispute other than a breach of the [Lease]\" because only the conciliation clause specifically referred to incidents of breach.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-33\">\n   We review the Lease\n   <em>\n    de novo\n   </em>\n   to determine whether the parties' dispute is arbitrable.\n   <em>\n    Rhode Island Council 94\n   </em>\n   ,\n   <extracted-citation case-ids=\"12321807\" index=\"13\" url=\"https://cite.case.law/a3d/159/83/#p85\">\n    159 A.3d at 85\n   </extracted-citation>\n   .

This is true especially when the contract provisions are so closely linked by their appearance together, one after the other, in Section 14.3 \"Conciliation; Arbitration.\" Their proximity to one another in the same section of the Lease leads us to the inevitable conclusion that the two provisions \"are associated with and take color from each other[.]\"\n   <em>\n    Industrial National Bank v.

For the reasons expanded upon below, when Section 14.3 \"Conciliation; Arbitration\" is read as a whole, as it must be, it is apparent that the conciliation and arbitration provisions create a seamless two-step dispute resolution process, rather than two mutually exclusive processes pertaining to separate issues.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-34\">\n   Consequently, we do not agree with the analysis of the hearing justice. This is so because the two contractual clauses can reasonably be construed so as to avoid conflict with one another, thus making the specific-over-general rule inapplicable.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-35\">\n   <em>\n    Park\n   </em>\n   ,\n   <extracted-citation case-ids=\"9268676\" index=\"18\" url=\"https://cite.case.law/a2d/844/687/#p694\">\n    844 A.2d at 694\n   </extracted-citation>\n   . We will not apply the canon to create a conflict.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-36\">\n   The conciliation clause, Section 14.3.1, requires the parties to attempt an amicable resolution of \"any controversy, claim or dispute arising out of or relating to this Lease or with respect to any breach hereof[.]\" The Lease describes the contemplated conciliation process as \"mutual discussions to be initiated by written notice by the aggrieved party to the other party[,]\" which \"may be conducted over the telephone, or at a meeting, or meetings, held at the principal offices of Landlord or Tenant or at such other location as the parties may agree.\" In short, the conciliation clause does no more than obligate the parties to engage in frank and good faith discussions in an effort to hash out their differences before resorting to a third party to resolve them.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-37\">\n   However, should those amicable discussions fail to resolve the \"controversy, claim or dispute,\" the Lease provides the next step in the very next subsection. Section 14.3.2, the arbitration clause, begins with the following dependent clause:\n  </p>\n  <blockquote id=\"p-38\">\n   \"If the parties fail to resolve any such controversy, claim or dispute by amicable arrangement and compromise within the thirty (30) day period immediately following the date of the notice initiating such discussions referred to in subsection (a) [\n   <em>\n    sic\n   </em>\n   ] above * * *.\"\n  </blockquote>\n  <p id=\"p-39\">\n   The use of the word \"such\" in that dependent clause clearly refers back to the immediately preceding conciliation clause. The word \"such\" is an adjective defined by Black's Law Dictionary as \"That or those; having just been mentioned.\"\n   <em>\n    Black's Law Dictionary\n   </em>\n   1661 (10th ed. 2014). In line with that definition, \"[t]he word 'such,' when used in a contract or statute, must, in order to be intelligible, refer to some antecedent, and will generally be construed to refer to the last antecedent in the context[.]\"\n   <em>\n    American Smelting and Refining Company v.

Accordingly, the phrase \"such controversy, claim or dispute\" in the arbitration clause must refer to some antecedent. As this is the first appearance of the phrase \"controversy, claim or dispute\" in Section 14.3.2, we must cast our eyes to the preceding Section 14.3.1 to find that antecedent, and the only one we find is \"any controversy, claim or dispute arising out of or relating to this Lease or with respect to any breach hereof[.]\"\n   <footnotemark>\n    5\n   </footnotemark>\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-40\">\n   Therefore, we are driven to the conclusion that, by using the adjective \"such\" in the arbitration clause to describe \"controversy, claim or dispute,\" the drafters of the Lease intended the arbitration clause to be read in conjunction with the immediately preceding conciliation clause, and the two are not irreconcilable. Read as a whole, Section 14.3 provides that any \"controversy, claim or dispute,\" including claims of alleged breaches of the Lease, are to be arbitrated pursuant to Section 14.3.2, provided that the parties have attempted, and failed, to resolve those disputes through amicable mutual discussions, as contemplated in Section 14.3.1.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-41\">\n   <strong>\n    2\n   </strong>\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-42\">\n   <strong>\n    Landlord's Reservation of Rights and Remedies\n   </strong>\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-43\">\n   The plaintiffs also argue that the arbitration clause is neither \"exclusive, nor\n   mandatory, nor 'clearly written and expressed' \" because Article X of the Lease provides for specific remedies in the event of several defined \"Events of Default.\" Specifically, Section 10.2, entitled \"Remedies,\" contains the following language:\n  </p>\n  <blockquote id=\"p-44\">\n   \"10.2.1 Upon the occurrence of any Event of Default, Landlord may terminate this Lease upon thirty (30) days written notice to Tenant and, in addition to any right or remedy set forth herein, shall have all rights and remedies allowed at law or in equity or by statute or otherwise.\"\n  </blockquote>\n  <p id=\"p-45\">\n   The plaintiffs argue that, even if the arbitration clause in Section 14.3.2 provides for arbitration in the case of a breach of the Lease, the language in Section 10.2.1 gives them an additional, or alternative, option of pursuing litigation at their election.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-46\">\n   To support their argument, plaintiffs rely on our decision in\n   <em>\n    AVCORR Management, LLC\n   </em>\n   , where the Central Falls Detention Facility Corporation disputed claims for certain fees allegedly owed for administrative services that had been performed by AVCORR.\n   <em>\n    AVCORR Management, LLC\n   </em>\n   ,\n   <extracted-citation case-ids=\"7315676\" index=\"21\" url=\"https://cite.case.law/a3d/41/1007/#p1010\">\n    41 A.3d at 1009\n   </extracted-citation>\n   .

In considering the Lease at issue in this case in its entirety, as we must, I believe that the parties intended to exclude from the arbitration clause disputes relating to an alleged breach of the agreement. Accordingly, I respectfully dissent.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-62\">\n   As the majority notes, Section 14.3.1 of the Lease provides a mechanism for the conciliation of \"any controversy, claim or dispute arising out of or relating to this Lease or with respect to any breach hereof[.]\" Section 14.3.2 follows with a requirement that \"[i]f the parties fail to resolve any such controversy, claim or dispute by amicable arrangement[,]\" then \"the aggrieved party shall submit the controversy, claim or dispute to arbitration * * *.\"\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-63\">\n   What are we to make, however, of the conspicuous absence from the latter clause of the language \"or with respect to any breach hereof[?]\" The majority posits that the word \"such\" in Section 14.3.2 is sufficient to bring the entire antecedent phrase \"any controversy, claim or dispute arising out of or relating to this Lease with respect to any breach hereof\" under this umbrella of the arbitration clause-a perfectly reasonable proposition, I should think, were it not for other provisions of the Lease.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-64\">\n   Article X of the Lease spells out a number of occurrences that \"shall constitute an event of default\" and provides remedies for such defaults. Significantly, Section 10.1.3 designates as an event of default: \"Tenant shall have abandoned the Building or Premises[,]\" and Section 10.1.6 designates as an event of default: \"Tenant shall fail to commence construction of the Building within twelve (12) months of the date hereof or shall fail to complete the building within thirty (30) months after commencing construction of the same.\" The dispute at the heart of plaintiff's complaint in the present case is defendant's alleged failure to complete construction of the building within thirty months and its abandonment of the partially completed structure. In the event of default, Section 10.2.1 allows plaintiff to terminate the Lease upon thirty days written notice to defendant and, \"in addition to any right or remedy set forth [in the Lease],\" plaintiff \"shall have all rights and remedies allowed at law or in equity or by statute or otherwise.\"\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-65\">\n   In my opinion, the sweeping language of this provision, reserving to the plaintiff all rights and remedies at law or in equity, is broad enough to encompass recourse to the courts in the event of a default or breach of the Lease. It convinces me that the parties did not explicitly agree to arbitrate issues related to the defendant's breach of contract. \"[A] duty to arbitrate a dispute arises only when a party agrees to arbitration in clear and unequivocal language; and, even then, the party is only obligated to arbitrate issues that it explicitly agreed to arbitrate.\"\n   <em>\n    Weeks v. 735 Putnam Pike Operations, LLC\n   </em>\n   ,\n   <extracted-citation case-ids=\"7271275\" index=\"56\" url=\"https://cite.case.law/a3d/85/1147/#p1152\">\n    85 A.3d 1147\n   </extracted-citation>\n   , 1152 (R.I. 2014) (quoting\n   <em>\n    State Department of Corrections v.

On the contrary, the Lease provides in Section 10.2.1 that the plaintiff \"shall have all rights and remedies allowed at law or in equity[,]\" specifically, in Sections 10.1.3 and 10.1.6, in the event that the defendant abandons the premises and/or fails to complete construction within thirty months.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-66\">\n   I believe the hearing justice was correct to deny the defendant's motion to stay litigation in favor of arbitration.

Thus, the scopes of the conciliation and arbitration clauses are identical and, therefore, even if a conflict existed, the specific-over-general rule would be of little help in resolving a conflict between the two clauses.\n   </p>\n  </footnote>\n  <footnote label=\"6\">\n   <p id=\"p-74\">\n    The phrase \"rights or remedies\" is also used in Section 11.3, which provides that \"[i]n addition to any other right or remedy available to Landlord hereunder for breach of this Lease by Tenant, Landlord shall be entitled to specific performance of the provisions set forth in this Article XI.\" Specific performance is an equitable remedy. Here, again, the parties used the phrase \"right or remedy\" to refer to the redress available, not the method of achieving that redress. Of particular note is that Section 14.3.2 specifies that arbitration is to be conducted in accordance with the rules of the American Arbitration Association. Those rules provide arbitrators with the authority to order equitable remedies, including, but not limited to, specific performance.\n    <em>\n     See\n    </em>\n    American Arbitration Association Commercial Arbitration Rules and Mediation Procedures, Rule 47(a) (effective Oct. 1, 2013).\n   </p>\n  </footnote>\n </opinion>\n</casebody>\n"
