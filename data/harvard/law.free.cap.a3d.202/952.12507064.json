The respondent was provided notice that the Petition would be heard by this Court on March 14, 2019.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-9\">\n   We considered the Petition at our conference on March 14, 2019. The respondent failed to appear and show cause why the Petition should not be granted. Having heard the representations of disciplinary counsel, we deem that the Petition should be granted.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-10\">\n   Accordingly, it is ordered, adjudged, and decreed that the respondent, Peter Leach, is hereby suspended from the practice of law in this state, effective immediately and until further order of this Court.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-11\">\n   It is further ordered that David D. Curtin, Chief Disciplinary Counsel, be appointed as Special Master to take possession of and inventory the respondent's client files and accounts, and take whatever steps necessary to protect the clients' interests; including, but not limited to, returning the files to the clients or new counsel of the clients' choice. The Special Master is further authorized to have access to respondent's office and files in order to carry out these duties.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-12\">\n   Entered as an Order of this Court this 15\n   <sup>\n    th\n   </sup>\n   Day of March, 2019.\n  </p>\n </opinion>\n</casebody>\n"
