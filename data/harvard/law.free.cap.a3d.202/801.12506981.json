(PLS) appeals from the order entered on December 22, 2016, in the Court of Common Pleas of Beaver County, that determined the contractual no-hire provision in the Motor Carriage Services Contract (MCSC) between PLS and BeeMac Trucking, LLC and BeeMac Logistics, LLC (BeeMac)\n   <footnotemark>\n    1\n   </footnotemark>\n   was unenforceable as a matter\n   of law. A panel of this Court previously affirmed the trial court decision. PLS sought reargument before a court\n   <em>\n    en banc\n   </em>\n   on the issue of whether the trial court erred in denying a request for a preliminary injunction that sought to enforce a no-hire provision in a contract between PLS and BeeMac. PLS's request was granted and substituted briefs were filed by both parties. The case was submitted to the\n   <em>\n    en banc\n   </em>\n   panel without oral argument. After a thorough review of the submissions by the parties, relevant law, and the certified record, we affirm.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-10\">\n   PLS is a third party logistics provider. Essentially, it is a facilitator between those who need items shipped and those who are shippers. In its Appellant's Brief, PLS has provided a hypothetical transaction demonstrating its business model.\n  </p>\n  <blockquote id=\"p-11\">\n   - PLS will be retained by a potential shipper or existing customer to ship freight from its facility to certain specified locations;\n  </blockquote>\n  <blockquote id=\"p-12\">\n   - PLS's employee is well-trained to recognize the type of truck necessary for particular freight, and to know what \"lane\" the shipment must take to get to its destination;\n  </blockquote>\n  <blockquote id=\"p-13\">\n   - PLS's employee knows which reliable trucking companies can offer the needed transportation in the designated lane and under certain cost parameters;\n  </blockquote>\n  <blockquote id=\"p-14\">\n   - PLS arranges the shipment with the carrier.\n  </blockquote>\n  <p id=\"p-15\">\n   PLS's Brief, at 9-10.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-16\">\n   BeeMac is a shipping company that does non-exclusive business with PLS. As a non-exclusive shipper, BeeMac was required to enter into the MCSC with PLS. This contract is at the heart of the instant litigation. Paragraph 14.6 of the contract\n   <footnotemark>\n    2\n   </footnotemark>\n   is a no-hire provision that prohibits BeeMac from directly or indirectly hiring, soliciting for employment, inducing or attempting to induce, any employee of PLS or any of its affiliates to leave their employment with PLS or the affiliate. This prohibition is ostensibly in place for the duration of the contract, which is self-renewing,\n   <footnotemark>\n    3\n   </footnotemark>\n   and for two years post-contract.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-17\">\n   While the contract was still in force, four employees of PLS, Mary Colman, Racquel Pakutz, Michael Ceravolo,\n   <footnotemark>\n    4\n   </footnotemark>\n   and Natalia Hennings, left PLS and took employment with BeeMac.\n   <footnotemark>\n    5\n   </footnotemark>\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-18\">\n   PLS filed suit against both BeeMac and PLS's former employees, seeking an injunction preventing BeeMac from employing any former employees and to prevent BeeMac from soliciting business directly from other entities that had done business with PLS. The trial court granted PLS relief in part, preventing BeeMac from soliciting other PLS customers for the two-year period established by the Motor Carriage Services Contract. However, the trial court refused to grant PLS the injunctive\n   relief it sought regarding BeeMac's employment of the former PLS employees. PLS appealed.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-19\">\n   With this background in place, we turn our attention to the substance of our review. Our standard of review for an order granting or denying a preliminary injunction is as follows:\n  </p>\n  <blockquote id=\"p-20\">\n   We have emphasized that our review of a trial court's order granting or denying preliminary injunctive relief is \"highly deferential\".\n   <strong>\n    <em>\n     Summit Towne Centre, Inc. v.

Accordingly, the trial court looked to case law from other jurisdictions for guidance and followed the logic of those jurisdictions that do not allow such provisions between companies. The trial court determined the no-hire provision would violate public policy by preventing persons from seeking employment with certain companies without receiving additional consideration for the prohibition, or even necessarily having any input regarding or knowledge of the restrictive provision. Additionally, the trial court reasoned the no-hire provision was overly broad in that the enforceable no-solicitation provision between PLS and BeeMac sufficiently protected PLS from the loss of its clients, which was the ultimate purpose of all the relevant restrictions. Based upon the nature and limitations of our review, we agree with the trial court.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-24\">\n   Initially, we quote the relevant language from the MCSC:\n  </p>\n  <blockquote id=\"p-25\">\n   14.3 The parties acknowledge that during the term of the Contract there may be disclosed to CARRIER [BeeMac Trucking, LLC] confidential information concerning PLS' operations including, but not limited to, the names and addresses\n   of Shippers and others who are clients of PLS, volumes of traffic and rate data. During the term of this Contract and for a period of one year after termination of this Contract, CARRIER hereby agrees that it will not, either directly or indirectly, solicit any individual Shipper or other client of PLS, back-solicit and/or transport for itself, without the involvement of PLS, and freight that CARRIER handles pursuant to this Contract or freight which first becomes known to CARRIER as a result of CARRIER'S past, present or future dealings with PLS.\n   <sup>\n    [\n   </sup>\n   <footnotemark>\n    6\n   </footnotemark>\n   <sup>\n    ]\n   </sup>\n  </blockquote>\n  <blockquote id=\"p-26\">\n   ...\n  </blockquote>\n  <blockquote id=\"p-27\">\n   14.6 CARRIER agrees that, during the term of this Contract and for a period two (2) years after the termination of this Contract, neither Carrier nor any of its employees, agents, independent contractors or other persons performing services for or on behalf of CARRIER in connection with CARRIER's obligations under this Contract will, directly or indirectly, hire, solicit for employment, induce or attempt to induce any employees of PLS or any of its Affiliates to leave their employment with PLS or any Affiliate for any reason.\n  </blockquote>\n  <p id=\"p-28\">\n   MCSC, 8/30/2010, at 9-10.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-29\">\n   The trial court set forth its reasoning regarding the restrictive provisions of the MCSC, as follows:\n   <footnotemark>\n    7\n   </footnotemark>\n  </p>\n  <blockquote id=\"p-30\">\n   We now address the terms of the Motor Carrier [sic] Services Contract (Carrier Contract) between PLS and BeeMac Trucking. PLS is seeking an injunction with respect to two of the provisions of this contract, namely section 14.3, the non-solicitation of PLS customers, and section 14.6, the no-hiring of PLS employees. We will address each of these provisions.\n  </blockquote>\n  <blockquote id=\"p-31\">\n   First, with respect to section 14.3 of the parties' Carrier Contract, we note that such restrictions on trade are not always favored by the courts. Indeed, the Pennsylvania Supreme Court acknowledged that \"it has long been the rule at common law, that contracts in restraint of trade made independently of a sale of a business or contract of employment are void as against public policy regardless of the valuableness of the consideration exchanged.\"\n   <strong>\n    <em>\n     Jacobson &amp; Co. v.

We believe that if an employer wishes to limit its employees from future competition, this matter should be addressed directly between the employer and the employee, not between competing businesses. Moreover, in this case, such a restriction goes beyond the protected interest of PLS, which is its customers. So long as the former employee, or any employee of BeeMac, does not contact former customers of PLS, for the time period in the contract, in this case one year under section 14.3 of the Carrier Contract, there is no need to enforce the no-hire provision contained in section 14.6. For these reasons, we do not believe PLS has a substantial likelihood of success on the merits of its claim under section 14.6, and we will vacate the injunction prohibiting BeeMac Trucking from hiring former PLS employees.\n  </blockquote>\n  <p id=\"p-37\">\n   Trial Court Opinion, 12/22/2016, at 11-14.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-38\">\n   The trial court supported its decision by examining various decisions from\n   other jurisdictions and concluding the reasoning of those cases that disfavor such restrictions better represents the current state of Pennsylvania law.

Here, there is no proof that the employees knew of the clause between the companies. While there was a restrictive covenant in the employees' contracts with PLS, the trial court determined it was unenforceable as being oppressive or an attempt to foster a monopoly, thereby demonstrating unclean hands on the part of PLS.\n   <strong>\n    <em>\n     See\n    </em>\n   </strong>\n   Trial Court Opinion, 12/22/206 at 7.\n   <strong>\n    <em>\n     See also\n    </em>\n   </strong>\n   ,\n   <strong>\n    <em>\n     PLS v.

An example of how such covenants can produce harm is demonstrated by the following application of Paragraph 14.6. The PLS MCSC ostensibly prevents BeeMac from hiring any PLS employee for the term of the agreement, which is self-renewing,\n   <footnotemark>\n    9\n   </footnotemark>\n   and for an additional two years thereafter. Accordingly, each MCSC contract with a new carrier, results in a new restriction upon current employees from obtaining employment in the same or similar field of work. Employment restrictions are valid, in certain circumstances, in contracts between employer and employee.\n   <footnotemark>\n    10\n   </footnotemark>\n   As a general rule, those restrictions are in place, in an agreement between the employer and employee, at the time of initial employment. When a new restriction is added, to be enforceable, that restriction must be supported by additional consideration.\n   <strong>\n    <em>\n     See generally\n    </em>\n   </strong>\n   ,\n   <strong>\n    <em>\n     Insulation Corp. of America v.

If additional restrictions to the agreement between employer and employee are rendered unenforceable by a lack of additional consideration, PLS should not be entitled to circumvent that outcome through an agreement with a third party.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-45\">\n   Finally, the caselaw that supports such inter-company employment provisions generally uphold narrowly tailored restrictions. For example, in\n   <strong>\n    <em>\n     H &amp; M Commercial Driver Leasing v. Fox Valley Containers, Inc., supra\n    </em>\n   </strong>\n   , the provision at issue prevented Fox Valley from hiring only those drivers who had been supplied to Fox Valley by H &amp; M. It did not prevent Fox Valley from hiring any other driver who was working for H &amp; M. Here, Paragraph 14.6 prevents BeeMac, or any agent or independent contractor of BeeMac who is involved with providing services related to PLS, from hiring any PLS employee. By the plain reading of the language of this restrictive provision, it was meant to have effect in the broadest possible terms. This fact, coupled with the trial court's finding\n   that Paragraph 14.6 was largely superfluous in light of the enforceable non-solicitation clause, further supports our determination that the trial court's decision was based upon reasonable grounds.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-46\">\n   The scope of our review for a preliminary injunction is to determine if the trial court's ruling regarding injunctive relief had a sound basis.

Hence, my analysis is limited to a discussion of the fourth prong as it relates to the no-hire provision.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-53\">\n   It is undisputed that the laws of this Commonwealth are silent as to the enforceability of a no-hire provision, such as the condition provided in \u00a7 14.6 of BeeMac's contract with PLS (\"MCSC\").\n   <footnotemark>\n    3\n   </footnotemark>\n   Notwithstanding the lack of authority on point, I would hold that PLS has established a likelihood of success on the merits because I am persuaded that the no-hire provision is valid and enforceable.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-54\">\n   \"The legal effect or enforceability of a contract provision presents a question of law accorded full appellate review and is not limited to an abuse of discretion standard.\"\n   <strong>\n    <em>\n     Midwest Fin.

Super. 2003) (\"Absent fraud or unconscionability, courts should not set aside terms on which sophisticated parties agreed.\"). Here, the record suggests that PLS and BeeMac engaged in arm's length negotiations and exchanged valuable consideration in arriving at the agreement set forth in the MCSC. The record is devoid of allegations that PLS perpetrated a fraud or that the terms of the MCSC were unconscionable. Rather, the record reflects that BeeMac appreciated the consequences of entering into the MCSC with PLS, including its promise to refrain from hiring any PLS employee during the term of the contract, and for two years following its termination. Accordingly, Pennsylvania law generally supports a finding that the agreement is enforceable on its face.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-56\">\n   The question thus becomes whether \u00a7 14.6 is unenforceable as contrary to another aspect of Pennsylvania law. In resolving the issue, this Court must examine the provision actually before us, namely, BeeMac's agreement not to hire PLS's employees during the performance of the contract or for two years afterwards. This is a no-hire provision that binds BeeMac, not a non-compete clause binding PLS's employees. In my view, the majority errs in conflating the two, as there is no basis in Pennsylvania law for treating a no-hire provision as a restrictive covenant between an employer and an employee.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-57\">\n   By way of background, in a separate action not implicated in this appeal, PLS sued former employees for alleged violations of non-compete agreements. The trial court held the provisions to be unenforceable as overly-broad, as they were unlimited in geographic scope.\n   <strong>\n    <em>\n     See\n    </em>\n   </strong>\n   Trial Court Opinion, 12/22/16, at 8, 10. Further, the trial court declined to modify the scope of the provisions, concluding that PLS had unclean hands, as the overbreadth evidenced an intent to oppress the employees.\n   <strong>\n    <em>\n     Id.\n    </em>\n   </strong>\n   at 6-8.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-58\">\n   The majority seizes upon these holdings to find that \"[i]t would be incongruous to strike the employees' restrictive covenant, finding PLS to have unclean hands, yet allow PLS to achieve the same result via a\n   contract between companies.\" Majority Opinion at 807. The majority opines that the no-hire provision \"is similarly overbroad, preventing any PLS employee from working for any PLS customer.\"\n   <strong>\n    <em>\n     Id.\n    </em>\n   </strong>\n   The majority further confuses the issues by relying upon a New Mexico federal district court's discussion of a Texas court's invalidation of an agreement between the buyer and seller of a company that included a provision purporting to prevent employees of the company from participating in a competing business, although the employees were not parties to the contract.\n   <strong>\n    <em>\n     Id.\n    </em>\n   </strong>\n   at 807-08 (quoting\n   <strong>\n    <em>\n     Richards Energy Compression, LLC v.

The provisions are in separate agreements, with distinct rights and responsibilities, made by different parties for different purposes. This is not at all akin to the Texas case above in which a company made an agreement to bind individuals who were not parties to the contract. Further, the no-hire provision does not prevent any PLS employee from working for any PLS customer as the majority suggests; rather, it prevents only the hire of PLS employees by BeeMac, and thus is far narrower in scope than the non-compete agreements included in the employees' contracts. The majority's apparent assumption that such no-hire provisions are contained in every agreement PLS reaches with a new customer is simply not supported by the record, and is not a proper basis for consideration of the issue before us.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-60\">\n   Accordingly, it is inappropriate to construe \u00a7 14.6 at issue as a back-door restrictive covenant through which an employer signs away rights of its employees without supplying consideration. The no-hire provision does not restrict the employees' actions, but rather is a concession from BeeMac that, in exchange for its access to PLS's specialized industry knowledge and contacts through PLS's employees, BeeMac would not thereafter appropriate those employees and obviate the need for PLS's services. BeeMac's contract with PLS does nothing to restrict PLS's employees from seeking employment with any other company.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-61\">\n   The proper analysis of the issue in this appeal is whether the no-hire provision in the PLS-BeeMac contract is a reasonable restraint upon trade.

Where the parties are both sophisticated and in equal bargaining positions, where the provision is clear and mutually binding, and where the provision does not impose an overly broad restraint, the Court is unwilling to declare the provision unreasonable because one party determines\n   <em>\n    ex ante\n   </em>\n   that the bargain struck was not desirable.\n  </blockquote>\n  <p id=\"p-68\">\n   <strong>\n    <em>\n     Id.\n    </em>\n   </strong>\n   at *7 (citation omitted).\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-69\">\n   The only relevant distinction I discern between the no-hire provision at issue in\n   <strong>\n    <em>\n     GeoDecisions\n    </em>\n   </strong>\n   and that of the instant case is that the one in\n   <strong>\n    <em>\n     GeoDecisions\n    </em>\n   </strong>\n   was mutually-applicable while the instant provision was not. However, that difference does not\n   warrant a different result. I would hold that the restraint on trade presented in \u00a7 14.6 of the MCSC is a reasonable, and thus valid and enforceable, restraint upon trade for the reasons discussed by the court in\n   <strong>\n    <em>\n     GeoDecisions\n    </em>\n   </strong>\n   .\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-70\">\n   I further disagree with the majority's conclusion that the no-hire provision violates public policy. Our Supreme Court has cautioned against finding a contract violates public policy unless that violation is clear:\n  </p>\n  <blockquote id=\"p-71\">\n   [p]ublic policy is to be ascertained by reference to the laws and legal precedents and not from general considerations of supposed public interest. As the term \"public policy\" is vague, there must be found definite indications in the law of the sovereignty to justify the invalidation of a contract as contrary to that policy .... Only dominant public policy would justify such action. In the absence of a plain indication of that policy through long governmental practice or statutory enactments, or of violations of obvious ethical or moral standards, the Court should not assume to declare contracts ... contrary to public policy. The courts must be content to await legislative action.\n  </blockquote>\n  <p id=\"p-72\">\n   <strong>\n    <em>\n     Safe Auto Ins. Co. v.

However, as discussed above, BeeMac received valuable consideration for its promise not to hire PLS employees, thereby limiting its own pool of applicants from which it could hire. Although this agreement had an indirect effect on those PLS employees seeking employment away from PLS, that effect, insofar as the MCSC is concerned, prohibited those employees only from seeking employment with BeeMac and its affiliates who deal with PLS. I discern no strong public policy against such a limitation, and I suggest that the dearth of Pennsylvania statutory or case law invalidating such an agreement supports the conclusion that it does not violate \"dominant public policy.\"\n   <strong>\n    <em>\n     <extracted-citation case-ids=\"475505,7874309,7874198,475549\" index=\"60\" url=\"https://cite.case.law/a2d/648/755/\">\n      Id.\n     </extracted-citation>\n    </em>\n   </strong>\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-74\">\n   We have long held that the purpose of injunctive relief is \"to prevent irreparable injury or gross injustice by preserving the\n   <em>\n    status quo\n   </em>\n   as it exists or as it previously existed before the acts complained of in the complaint.\n   <strong>\n    <em>\n     Ambrogi v.

By denying PLS's petition for injunctive relief, the trial court effectively permitted BeeMac to enjoy the benefit of its purported breach while the issue proceeded through litigation. In the interim, BeeMac is free to leverage the specialized knowledge that PLS's former employees acquired while under its employment. Even if PLS were to succeed on the merits following trial, BeeMac still gained a competitive advantage.
