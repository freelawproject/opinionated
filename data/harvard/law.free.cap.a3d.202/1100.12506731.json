Shortly after Santiago's birth in 2009, the petitioner, utilizing both a birth certificate that falsely listed her, and her husband at that time, as Santiago's parents and a fraudulent United States passport, illegally brought him into the United States.\n   <footnotemark>\n    4\n   </footnotemark>\n   Santiago remained in the petitioner's care until October, 2012, when the Superior Court,\n   <em>\n    Heller, J.\n   </em>\n   , granted the respondent's motion for an order of temporary custody.\n   <em>\n    In re Santiago G.\n   </em>\n   ,\n   <extracted-citation index=\"0\" url=\"https://cite.case.law/citations/?q=318%20Conn.%20449\">\n    318 Conn. 449\n   </extracted-citation>\n   , 456-57,\n   <extracted-citation index=\"1\" url=\"https://cite.case.law/citations/?q=121%20A.3d%20708\">\n    121 A.3d 708\n   </extracted-citation>\n   (2015). After initially removing Santiago to a temporary foster home in November, 2012, the Department of Children and Families (department) placed him in another foster home in December, 2012, where he remains today. Id., at 457,\n   <extracted-citation index=\"2\" url=\"https://cite.case.law/citations/?q=121%20A.3d%20708\">\n    121 A.3d 708\n   </extracted-citation>\n   .\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-11\">\n   On November 8, 2013, the petitioner filed a petition for a writ of habeas corpus seeking to regain custody of Santiago. The petitioner alleged that the department's refusal to release Santiago to her custody violated her and Santiago's federal and state constitutional rights to due process and was contrary to Santiago's best interest. On July 3, 2014, the respondent filed a motion to dismiss the petition claiming that the petitioner lacked\n   standing because she was neither the biological parent nor a properly declared adoptive parent of Santiago, and she had not otherwise claimed to be Santiago's legal guardian. The petitioner filed an objection to the motion to dismiss, claiming that on September 19, 2013, a Guatemalan court had recognized the validity of the admittedly false birth certificate and, therefore, recognized her as Santiago's parent. On October 23, 2014, the court issued a memorandum of decision in which it found that \"the mere assertion by the petitioner that she is the legal guardian of the child under [Guatemalan] law, without more, is insufficient to confer standing.\" As a result of this finding, the court ordered the petitioner to offer proof, at a preliminary evidentiary hearing on her standing, that she was Santiago's legal guardian.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-12\">\n   On June 17, 2015, prior to the evidentiary hearing, Santiago's biological mother\n   filed a declaratory action with a Guatemalan court asking the court to grant custody of Santiago to the petitioner. One day later, on June 18, 2015, the Guatemalan court issued a declaratory judgment granting the petitioner \"parental rights, custody, and representation [of Santiago] ....\" The Guatemalan court relied on the false birth certificate as well as an affidavit from Santiago's biological mother in granting custody of Santiago to the petitioner.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-13\">\n   On November 17, 2015, the court held the evidentiary hearing. During the hearing, the petitioner submitted a copy of the judgment file from the Guatemalan court proceedings as a full exhibit and presented testimony of the Guatemalan attorney who had represented Santiago's biological mother regarding the Guatemalan court's decree. The court subsequently allowed both parties to file posthearing briefs. The respondent argued in her brief that the Guatemalan decree did not deserve\n   recognition by Connecticut courts because (1) the process underlying that decree contained procedural irregularities fatal to recognition, and (2) the substance of the decree was based on an admittedly false birth certificate.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-14\">\n   The court,\n   <em>\n    Colin, J.\n   </em>\n   , rendered its decision on February 16, 2016, and found that the petitioner had established prima facie evidence of her standing,\n   <footnotemark>\n    5\n   </footnotemark>\n   but noted that \"[t]he determination that a prima facie case has been established in denying a motion to dismiss does not necessarily mean that the court, at the time of the final hearing on the merits, is required to take as true the evidence offered by the petitioner at the standing hearing.\" On March 7, 2016, the respondent filed a motion to reargue. The court thereafter granted the respondent's motion in part, denied it in part, and reaffirmed its decision on the issue of standing.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-15\">\n   The parties subsequently filed separate motions for summary judgment. The petitioner argued in her motion that the court's previous recognition of prima facie evidence of standing established that there was no genuine issue of material fact as to the petitioner's legal right to custody of Santiago. The respondent argued in her motion that the Guatemalan court decree was not entitled to recognition because it was based on a false birth certificate, and notice of the Guatemalan proceedings had not been provided to the respondent.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-16\">\n   On January 12, 2017, the court granted the respondent's motion for summary judgment, denied the petitioner's motion for summary judgment, and dismissed the habeas petition.\n   <footnotemark>\n    6\n   </footnotemark>\n   In rendering its decision, the court applied the Uniform Child Custody Jurisdiction and Enforcement Act, General Statutes \u00a7 46b-115 et seq. (act), and determined that the Guatemalan court decree was not entitled to recognition because it was based on the petitioner's fraudulent and illegal conduct that was repugnant to the public policy of this state, it relied on the false birth certificate, and it was secured without adequate notice to the respondent. The court, therefore, concluded that the petitioner could not demonstrate\n   that she is the biological parent or legal guardian of Santiago and dismissed the habeas petition. On February 1, 2017, the petitioner filed a motion to reargue, and the court reaffirmed its decision on June 20, 2017. See footnote 1 of this opinion. This appeal followed.\n   <footnotemark>\n    7\n   </footnotemark>\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-17\">\n   We first set forth the applicable standard of review. \"Our review of the trial court's decision to grant [a] motion for summary judgment is plenary.... In seeking summary judgment, it is the movant who has the burden of showing the nonexistence of any issue of\n   fact. The courts are in entire agreement that the moving party for summary judgment has the burden of showing the absence of any genuine issue as to all the material facts, which, under applicable principles of law, entitle him to a judgment as a matter of law. The courts hold the movant to a strict standard. To satisfy his burden the movant must make a showing that it is quite clear what the truth is, and that excludes any real doubt as to the existence of any genuine issue of material fact.... As the burden of proof is on the movant, the evidence must be viewed in the light most favorable to the opponent.... When documents submitted in support of a motion for summary judgment fail to establish that there is no genuine issue of material fact, the non-moving party has no obligation to submit documents establishing the existence of such an issue.... Once the moving party has met its burden, however, the opposing party must present evidence that demonstrates the existence of some disputed factual issue.\" (Citation omitted; internal quotation marks omitted.)\n   <em>\n    Rickel\n   </em>\n   v.\n   <em>\n    Komaromi\n   </em>\n   ,\n   <extracted-citation case-ids=\"12416261\" index=\"3\" url=\"https://cite.case.law/conn-app/144/775/#p779\">\n    144 Conn.

Specifically, the petitioner argues that, despite the admittedly false birth certificate, the Guatemalan court's decree created a genuine issue of material fact that she was the legal guardian or custodian of Santiago. The respondent claims that the court properly determined that there was no genuine issue of material fact that the Guatemalan decree was not entitled to recognition, arguing that the petitioner's participation in the fraud regarding the\n   birth certificate made enforcement of the decree repugnant to the public policy of this state.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-20\">\n   We first note that the false birth certificate cannot be the basis for the petitioner's claim for custody because it clearly was fraudulent, and the petitioner has conceded that the birth certificate falsely listed her and her former husband as Santiago's biological parents. Moreover, our Supreme Court determined that the birth certificate has no legal effect in the United\n   States. See\n   <em>\n    In re Santiago G.\n   </em>\n   , supra,\n   <extracted-citation index=\"5\" url=\"https://cite.case.law/citations/?q=318%20Conn.%20449\">\n    318 Conn. at 471-72\n   </extracted-citation>\n   ,\n   <extracted-citation index=\"6\" url=\"https://cite.case.law/citations/?q=121%20A.3d%20708\">\n    121 A.3d 708\n   </extracted-citation>\n   (\"[A]lthough [the petitioner] was in possession of a birth certificate naming her as Santiago's mother, she ultimately conceded that that birth certificate was fraudulent. As we previously have explained, [a] birth certificate is a vital record that must accurately reflect legal relationships between parents and children-it does not create those relationships.... In sum, it was absolutely correct that Santiago had no legal guardian in the United States, and neither the parties nor the court was mistaken in this regard.\" [Citation omitted; internal quotation marks omitted.] ).\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-21\">\n   The crux of the petitioner's claim, therefore, is that, despite the previous ruling of our Supreme Court acknowledging the fraudulent nature of the birth certificate, the Guatemalan court's decree was entitled to recognition under the rules of comity, and summary judgment in favor of the respondent should not have been rendered because there was a genuine issue of material fact as to whether the decree was obtained by fraud.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-22\">\n   \"[C]omity is a flexible doctrine, the application of which rests in the discretion of the state where enforcement of a foreign order is sought....

Additionally, the petitioner does not dispute that the Guatemalan court relied on the same false birth certificate in issuing its judgment confirming the petitioner's parental guardianship rights to Santiago. The trial court also listed the following undisputed facts set forth in the petition: \"The petitioner is a citizen of Argentina and a legal resident of the United States .... [The] Guatemalan birth certificate identifies the petitioner and her estranged husband as the child's parents. She brought him to the United States shortly after his birth.... She admitted that she obtained custody of a newborn that was not legally adopted and that she illegally brought the child into the United States with a false birth certificate and a fraudulent United States passport.\" (Footnote omitted.)\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-27\">\n   The petitioner, however, presented additional evidence during the summary judgment proceeding that she had disclosed to the Guatemalan court that she was not Santiago's biological mother, and that the birth certificate was falsified. This included the sworn affidavit of Santiago's biological mother, as well as DNA evidence confirming that the petitioner was not Santiago's biological mother. The respondent, in the summary judgment proceeding, did not submit any contrary evidence that the petitioner made false representations to the Guatemalan court about those matters. Construing the evidence in the light most favorable to the petitioner, a factfinder could conclude that by providing such information to the Guatemalan court, she was attempting to correct her earlier fraud and have the Guatemalan court, after considering all of the evidence, confirm that the birth certificate, despite its factual flaws, was entitled to legal recognition under Guatemalan law. Because the facts relied upon by the petitioner regarding the Guatemalan court proceedings are undisputed, the remaining legal issue is whether the Guatemalan decree, like the birth certificate on which it is\n   based, is void as\n   against Connecticut public policy as found by the trial court.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-28\">\n   The petitioner argues that the respondent failed to satisfy her burden of proof on summary judgment that there was no genuine issue of material fact that the Guatemalan decree was not entitled to recognition under comity. Specifically, the petitioner argues that there is a genuine issue of material fact as to whether the Guatemalan court could conclude that she still had parental rights to Santiago, \"despite the initial misrepresentation that she was Santiago's biological mother.\"\n   <footnotemark>\n    9\n   </footnotemark>\n   We conclude, however, that this purported genuine issue of material fact is in reality a legal question about the enforcement of the Guatemalan court decree in Connecticut. On appeal, the petitioner relies on the Guatemalan court decree to satisfy the legal guardianship requirement of Connecticut law, and asks that we recognize that decree through the principle of comity.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-29\">\n   In Connecticut, a petitioner in a habeas corpus petition for custody of a child, in order to set forth a cognizable claim, must establish that she is the child's biological parent, his adoptive parent through a proper adoption, or his legal guardian through a recognized court procedure.

The problem here is not so much that the statutory framework is inadequate, but that it was not designed to accommodate individuals who have chosen to operate outside of the strictures of the law, regardless of their reasons. It was because the [biological mother] and [the petitioner] knowingly agreed to effectuate an illegal international adoption that [the petitioner] was vulnerable to the cruel act of a vindictive individual ... and all of the subsequent occurrences that that act set in motion. Because [the petitioner] lacked the status of a legal parent, she also lacked the constitutional and statutory rights attendant to that status. Additionally, the illegalities involved in [the petitioner] obtaining Santiago and\n   transporting him, using a fraudulent passport, to the United States resulted in significant delay in the discernment of the truth, during which the interests of Santiago in stability and permanency began to diverge, as it turns out inexorably, from\n   the interests of the [biological mother] and [the petitioner].

The court did not err in rendering summary judgment in favor of the respondent, who had met her burden of establishing the lack of any factual dispute concerning the invalidity of the Guatemalan court decree which was admittedly based, at least in part, on the false birth certificate.\n   <footnotemark>\n    10\n   </footnotemark>\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-33\">\n   In the present case, the petitioner merely refers to the court's finding after the evidentiary hearing on the motion to dismiss that there was some factual dispute as to the propriety of the Guatemalan court decree.

Accordingly, we conclude that the trial court, in construing the evidence in a light most favorable to the petitioner, properly concluded that the Guatemalan court's reliance on the fraudulently obtained birth certificate and Santiago's biological mother's sworn affidavit, in which she avers that she conferred legal authority to the petitioner over Santiago,\n   did not require its judgment to be enforced as a matter of comity.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-36\">\n   II\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-37\">\n   Additionally, the petitioner argues that the Guatemalan proceedings were adequately noticed or, at the very least, there was a genuine issue of material fact that adequate notice was provided.

The Guatemalan declaratory action, however, was not filed until June 17, 2015, and a hearing was held the next day on June 18, 2015. The respondent could not have been provided with notice of the proceedings prior to June 17, 2015, because the action had not yet been filed. If the petitioner knew on June 3, 2015, that a petition for custody and legal guardianship was going to be filed in the Guatemalan court on June 17, 2015, that filing was not disclosed to the court and the parties at the preevidentiary hearing, and no documents relating to the planned filing were provided at such hearing. Moreover, the petitioner does not dispute that notice to the respondent, as described in \u00a7 46b-115g (a), was not provided in the period between the filing of the proceeding and when the hearing took place one day later. As such, we conclude that the respondent met her burden of establishing that there was no genuine issue of material fact that adequate notice was not provided pursuant to \u00a7 46b-115ii.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-41\">\n   III\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-42\">\n   In sum, the petitioner has not established that there is any genuine issue of material fact that the court erroneously failed to accept and apply a Guatemalan court's decree, purportedly granting her parental guardianship rights over, and custody of, Santiago, on the\n   grounds set forth in her appeal, i.e., that the court erroneously concluded that (1) public policy prohibited recognition of a decree premised on a false birth certificate, and (2) the decree was obtained without proper notice to the respondent. The court properly ruled as a matter of law that such decree was against the public policy of, and not entitled to be enforced in, Connecticut. The court also correctly determined that any notice of the Guatemalan proceedings that was provided to the respondent was insufficient as a matter of law.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-43\">\n   Because we conclude that there was no genuine issue of material fact that the Guatemalan decree was not entitled to recognition in Connecticut, and that the respondent was entitled to summary judgment as a matter of law, we conclude that the trial court properly granted the respondent's\n   motion for summary judgment and dismissed the petitioner's habeas corpus petition.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-44\">\n   The judgment is affirmed.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-45\">\n   In this opinion the other judges concurred.\n  </p>\n  <footnote label=\"1\">\n   <p id=\"p-49\">\n    Both parties have at times referred to the trial court's rendering of summary judgment as premised on the petitioner's lack of standing to bring the habeas petition. The trial court, however, did not make reference to any standing issue in its memorandum of decision. In its memorandum of decision on the petitioner's motion to reargue her motion for summary judgment, the court set forth that it previously had concluded that the petitioner's prima facie claim of standing could not form a basis for the finding, without more, that a 2015 Guatemalan decree conclusively awarded custody to her and must be recognized. In that memorandum, the court also rejected the petitioner's claim under the Hague Convention first mentioned in her motion for summary judgment.\n   </p>\n   <p id=\"p-50\">\n    The court's conclusion in its memorandum of decision rendering summary judgment was as follows: \"If neither the birth certificate nor the 2015 decree purporting to award the petitioner parental guardianship and custody can be legally recognized, the crux of the habeas claim cannot be proven. If the gravamen of a habeas petition is that the petitioner must establish that she is the parent or the legal guardian of the child she seeks, then [Maria G.] cannot establish her claim under any set of facts she has brought forth. The respondent has demonstrated through counter affidavits, other submissions, and the law a legally sufficient defense to this action. Summary judgment in favor of the defendant is properly granted if the defendant in its motion raises at least one legally sufficient defense that would bar the plaintiff's claim and involves no triable issue of fact.... The court finds that there remains no triable issue of fact and the petitioner's request for relief therefore fails.\" (Citation omitted; internal quotation marks omitted.)
