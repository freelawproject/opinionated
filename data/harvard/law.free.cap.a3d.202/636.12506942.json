Each appellant challenges certain conditions of PSL that the Board has imposed upon them. Most of the challenged conditions involve restrictions on appellants' Internet use. The instant appeals follow in the wake of the New Jersey Supreme Court's decision in\n   <em>\n    J.I. v. N.J.

Additionally, a general condition requires PSL offenders to \"[r]efrain from using any computer and/or device to create any social networking profile or to access any social networking service or chat room in the offender's name or any other name for any reason unless expressly authorized by the District Parole Supervisor.\" N.J.A.C. 10A:71-6.12(d)(25).\n   <footnotemark>\n    2\n   </footnotemark>\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-62\">\n   While these appeals were pending, the Board proposed and adopted new regulations regarding the imposition of special conditions restricting Internet access in response to the Court's decision in\n   <em>\n    J.I\n   </em>\n   . N.J.A.C. 10A:72-14.1 to 14.4 ; 49 N.J.R. 3408(a) (Oct. 16,\n   2017) (proposed); 50 N.J.R. 1154(a) (Apr. 16, 2018) (adopted). The Board sought to \"codif[y] the procedures for the imposition of a special condition prohibiting a community or parole supervision for life offender from accessing the Internet, including the criteria, procedure, and review process.\" 49 N.J.R. 3408(a). The Board adopted the regulations with minor amendments on April 16, 2018. 50 N.J.R. 1154(a).\n   <footnotemark>\n    3\n   </footnotemark>\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-63\">\n   The regulations adopted after\n   <em>\n    J.I\n   </em>\n   . establish new criteria and procedures for the imposition of a special condition restricting Internet access. The adopted regulations \"appl[y] to the imposition of a special condition prohibiting an offender access to the Internet[.]\" N.J.A.C. 10A:72-14.1(a). Under the regulations, a District Parole Supervisor may impose an Internet-access condition if:\n  </p>\n  <blockquote id=\"p-64\">\n   1. There is a specific and articulable reason and a clear purpose for the imposition of the Internet access condition; and\n  </blockquote>\n  <blockquote id=\"p-65\">\n   2. The imposition of the Internet access condition will act as an aid to the offender's re-entry effort, will promote the rehabilitation of the offender, is deemed necessary to protect the public, or will reduce recidivism by the offender.\n  </blockquote>\n  <blockquote id=\"p-66\">\n   [ N.J.A.C. 10A:72-14.1(b)(1) to (2).]\n  </blockquote>\n  <p id=\"p-67\">\n   Next, the regulations codify the restrictions that may be imposed on a PSL offender's Internet access:\n  </p>\n  <blockquote id=\"p-68\">\n   (c) The Internet access condition shall include, but not be limited to, the following:\n  </blockquote>\n  <blockquote id=\"p-69\">\n   1. The offender is to refrain from the possession and/or utilization of any computer and/or device that permits access to the Internet unless specifically authorized by the District Parole Supervisor or designee. If the District Parole Supervisor or designee permits use of a computer and/or device that is capable of accessing the Internet, the offender shall be subject to the following restrictions and conditions:\n  </blockquote>\n  <blockquote id=\"p-70\">\n   i. The offender is to refrain from accessing the Internet from any computer and/or device at any time or for any reason unless authorized by the District Parole Supervisor or designee;\n  </blockquote>\n  <blockquote id=\"p-71\">\n   ii. The offender is prohibited from possessing or using any data encryption techniques and/or software\n   programs that conceal, mask, alter, eliminate, and/or destroy information, and/or data from a computer and/or device;\n  </blockquote>\n  <blockquote id=\"p-72\">\n   iii. The offender agrees to install on the computer and/or device, at his or her expense, one or more hardware or software system(s) to monitor computer and/or device use if such hardware or software system(s) is(are) determined to be necessary by the District Parole Supervisor or designee;\n  </blockquote>\n  <blockquote id=\"p-73\">\n   iv. The offender agrees to permit the monitoring of the computer and/or device activity by a parole officer and/or computer/device specialist through the use of electronic means;\n  </blockquote>\n  <blockquote id=\"p-74\">\n   v. The offender is subject to periodic unannounced examinations of the computer and/or device by a parole officer or designated computer/device specialist, including the retrieval and copying of all data from the computer and/or device and any internal or external peripherals and removal of such equipment to conduct a more thorough inspection; and\n  </blockquote>\n  <blockquote id=\"p-75\">\n   vi. The offender is to disclose all usernames and passwords used by him or her to access any computer/device, e-mail address, and approved social networking service or chat room, as well as any other username(s) and password(s) used by him or her to access any data, information, image, program, signal, or file on the computer/device deemed necessary by a parole officer to ensure compliance with the conditions of supervision.\n  </blockquote>\n  <blockquote id=\"p-76\">\n   [ N.J.A.C. 10A:72-14.1(c)(1)(i) to (iv).]\n  </blockquote>\n  <p id=\"p-77\">\n   In addition, the regulations detail the procedure for imposing a special condition restricting Internet access. N.J.A.C. 10A:72-14.2. A District Parole Supervisor must provide \"written notice of the imposition of an Internet access condition[,] ... includ[ing] the basis for imposition of the condition.\" N.J.A.C. 10A:72-14.2(a). The offender must also be \"provided with a written informational statement that details the procedure for the imposition of the Internet access condition.\" N.J.A.C. 10A:72-14.2(b). \"The offender shall indicate in writing whether he or she contests the allegations, the conclusions to be drawn from the allegations, or the justification supporting the imposition of the Internet access condition.\" N.J.A.C. 10A:72-14.2(c).\n   <footnotemark>\n    4\n   </footnotemark>\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-78\">\n   A contesting offender has \"[ten] business days to submit a written statement or documentation to the District Parole Office to be considered before the Internet access condition becomes\n   effective.\" N.J.A.C. 10A:72-14.2(e)(1). If the offender submits a written statement or documentation within ten business days, the condition does not become effective until it is reviewed by a Board panel. N.J.A.C. 10A:72-14.2(e)(3). The Board panel shall review the basis for the imposition of the condition and the written statement of the offender and notify the offender and the District Parole Supervisor in writing whether it affirms or vacates the imposition of the condition. N.J.A.C. 10A:72-14.3(a) to (c).\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-79\">\n   Finally, the regulations provide that a District Parole Supervisor will annually review the Internet-access condition. N.J.A.C. 10A:72-14.4(a). On review, the following criteria will be considered:\n  </p>\n  <blockquote id=\"p-80\">\n   1. There is a reasonable basis to preclude access to the Internet;\n  </blockquote>\n  <blockquote id=\"p-81\">\n   2. Internet use is consistent with the continued rehabilitation of the offender and will not compromise public safety;\n  </blockquote>\n  <blockquote id=\"p-82\">\n   3. The offender is in compliance with the conditions of supervision;\n  </blockquote>\n  <blockquote id=\"p-83\">\n   4. The offender has met the goals listed in his or her Case Plan Agreement and is progressing in a pro-social manner; and\n  </blockquote>\n  <blockquote id=\"p-84\">\n   5. The offender's treatment provider, if the offender is presently participating in counseling, is of the opinion that Internet access will promote the rehabilitation of the offender and assist the offender's re-entry efforts.\n  </blockquote>\n  <blockquote id=\"p-85\">\n   [ N.J.A.C. 10A:72-14.4(c)(1) to (5).]\n  </blockquote>\n  <p id=\"p-86\">\n   If the offender contests the justification for continuation of the condition, the condition remains in effect pending review by a Board panel. N.J.A.C. 10A:72-14.4(e).\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-87\">\n   We note that by adopting these new regulations, the Board has filled some regulatory gaps and has provided greater protections to PSL offenders than were available when these appeals were filed. We also reiterate that the statutory and regulatory scheme governing PSL is tempered by administrative and constitutional protections afforded to parolees. With these principles in mind, we now turn to the cases at hand.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-88\">\n   II.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-89\">\n   (Factual and Procedural Background)\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-90\">\n   <em>\n    K.G.\n   </em>\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-91\">\n   On February 15, 2013, K.G. pled guilty of one count of endangering the welfare of a child, N.J.S.A. 2C: 24-4(a). K.G. had sex\n   with a fifteen-year-old neighbor who became pregnant. He did not, however, use the Internet in the commission of the offense. K.G. was sentenced to PSL, which commenced immediately upon his conviction because K.G. was not sentenced to a term of incarceration. K.G. was subjected to general conditions under PSL, including a condition that he would refrain from using social-networking websites (\"social-networking general condition\") and that he was prohibited from leaving the state without permission.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-92\">\n   On August 20, 2015, parole authorities discovered that K.G. had been using Facebook, Instagram, and Snapchat. The parole authorities seized and searched K.G.'s cell phone, revealing that K.G. had used the online dating applications Tinder and Badoo and that K.G. had nude photographs of himself and other women, some involving sexual acts, on his cell phone. Additionally, K.G. admitted to traveling out of state without permission on two occasions. K.G. was arrested for these violations and was detained in jail pending a hearing.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-93\">\n   The Board conducted a parole revocation hearing on September 17, 2015, and concluded that K.G.'s PSL would continue with K.G. being subject to the Electronic Monitoring Program. K.G. was released on October 12, 2015. On November 9, 2015, the local parole office imposed a special condition of PSL prohibiting K.G. from accessing \"any computer and/or device that permits access to the Internet unless authorized by the District Parole Supervisor\" (\"no-Internet special condition\"). If authorized to use such a device by the District Parole Supervisor, K.G. was required to (1) refrain from using any techniques or programs that concealed or destroyed information on his computers or devices, (2) install, at his own expense, software that allows for the monitoring of his computers or devices, if determined necessary by the District Parole Supervisor, (3) permit the Board to monitor his computers or devices through electronic means, (4) allow for periodic unannounced\n   examinations of his computers or devices, and (5) disclose all passwords used to access any data, information, image, or\n   program on file on his computers or devices (\"monitoring special conditions\").\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-94\">\n   In December 2015, K.G. wrote to the District Parole Supervisor, seeking rescission of the no-Internet and monitoring special conditions. Alternatively, K.G. requested permission to use the Internet and electronic devices for ten specific purposes. In January 2016, the Division of Parole affirmed the imposition of the special conditions, but authorized K.G. to use the Internet for nine of the ten requested purposes, except that K.G. was prohibited from using social-networking websites even for business purposes. The Board required K.G. to install monitoring software on his devices and to disclose all passwords.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-95\">\n   K.G. administratively appealed the conditions to a Board panel, which affirmed the conditions. K.G. appealed the panel's decision to the full Board, which affirmed the conditions in a final agency decision on July 27, 2016. In its written decision, the Board found that the imposition of the special conditions was warranted based on K.G.'s failure to adhere to the social-networking general condition. It noted that \"this behavior can be considered high risk and could be considered a trigger for possible re-offense given the ages of the users are not always known.\" Additionally, considering K.G.'s description of his offense in an October 14, 2015 psychological evaluation, the Board found that \"the opportunistic and exploitive elements of [K.G.]'s crime underscore the concerns [the Board] has for permitting social networking access.\"\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-96\">\n   K.G. appealed the final agency decision.\n   <footnotemark>\n    5\n   </footnotemark>\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-97\">\n   <em>\n    C.C.\n   </em>\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-98\">\n   On January 29, 2007, C.C. pled guilty to attempted sexual assault, N.J.S.A. 2C:14-2(c)(4), and luring/enticing a child victim by various means, N.J.S.A. 2C:13-6. C.C.'s offense involved using an AOL public chat room to contact an undercover detective posing as a fourteen-year-old girl, sending sexually explicit photos of himself, and arranging to meet in person to have sex. C.C. was sentenced to four years' incarceration and was granted parole on February 5, 2008, subject to PSL. Upon his release, C.C. was subjected to the social-networking general condition and the no-Internet and monitoring special conditions.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-99\">\n   On December 15, 2015, C.C. was arrested for violating the conditions of his PSL, including having unsupervised contact with two minors, maintaining a Facebook account and a personal advertisement on Craigslist, using an iPhone to access the Internet without permission, and lying to his parole officer about his employment. On December 15, 2016, C.C. was released under PSL, subject to the social-networking general condition and the no-Internet and monitoring special conditions.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-100\">\n   On February 27, 2017, C.C. filed an administrative appeal seeking to vacate the general and special conditions restricting his Internet access. On March 22, 2017, a Board panel affirmed the imposition of these conditions. On May 31, 2017, the full Board issued a final agency decision affirming the imposition of the conditions. In\n   its written decision, the Board found that the conditions were justified based on the nature of C.C.'s underlying offense and his previous violations of conditions of PSL.

On February 28, 2013, J.L. pled guilty to one count of endangering the welfare of a child, N.J.S.A. 2C:24-4(a), and was sentenced to three years' incarceration and PSL. In the underlying incident, J.L. friend-requested a fifteen-year-old girl on Facebook and exchanged instant messages and nude photographs with the girl. J.L. arranged to meet the girl at a movie theater. After meeting at the movie theater, J.L. used his phone to show the girl pornography and had sex with her.\n   <footnotemark>\n    8\n   </footnotemark>\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-102\">\n   On July 16, 2014, J.L. was granted parole under PSL and was subjected to special conditions. One special condition prohibited J.L. from purchasing, possessing, or consuming alcohol and \"from frequenting establishments whose primary purpose is the sale of alcohol (i.e. bars and liquor stores).\" (\"no-alcohol special condition\"). J.L. was also subject to the no-Internet special condition and a condition prohibiting him from \"purchasing, viewing, downloading, possessing and/or creating a picture, photograph, negative, film, movie, videotape, Blu-ray, DVD, CD, CD-ROM, streaming video, video game, computer generated or virtual image or other representation, publication, sound recording or live performance that is predominately orientated to descriptions or depictions of sexual activity.\"\n   <footnotemark>\n    9\n   </footnotemark>\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-103\">\n   On June 1, 2015, J.L. was arrested for violating conditions of his PSL regarding out-of-state travel and consuming alcohol. The Board revoked J.L.'s parole, and J.L. was released from incarceration on May 31, 2016 after serving a one-year term. Upon his release, the Board re-imposed the no-alcohol special condition, but did not re-impose the no-Internet or pornography special conditions.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-104\">\n   On September 12, 2016, J.L. submitted an administrative appeal seeking removal of the no-alcohol condition, as well as the no-Internet and pornography special conditions, both of which had not actually been re-imposed. In response to this appeal, the District Parole Supervisor affirmed the no-alcohol special condition and found that the no-Internet and no-pornography conditions had never been re-imposed. The District Parole Supervisor instead imposed the notify-computer special condition, which required J.L. to notify his\n   parole officer before purchasing, possessing or utilizing any computer or device that permits access to the Internet and to adhere to the monitoring special conditions on all devices.\n   <footnotemark>\n    10\n   </footnotemark>\n   The District Parole Supervisor additionally imposed a special condition prohibiting J.L. \"from accessing any sexually-oriented websites, material, information or data.\"\n   <footnotemark>\n    11\n   </footnotemark>\n   In February 2017, J.L. requested the rescission of the social-networking general condition, the notify-computer special condition, the monitoring special condition, the special condition restricting access to sexually-oriented materials, and the no-alcohol special condition. Both a private psychologist and a treatment center had evaluated J.L. and determined that he did not need substance abuse treatment. A District Parole Supervisor denied J.L.'s requests to rescind these conditions.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-105\">\n   In March 2017, a Board panel affirmed the conditions. J.L. appealed to the full Board, which affirmed the conditions in a final agency decision on May 31, 2017. In its written decision, the Board found that the social-networking general condition and the notify-computer special condition were justified based on J.L.'s use of social-networking websites and the Internet in his underlying offense. The Board also found that \"sexually-oriented materials\" was clearly defined in the language of the special condition and that this special condition was justified based on the fact that J.L. showed his victim pornography during the underlying offense. Finally, the Board found that the no-alcohol condition did not inhibit J.L.'s business and that J.L. had not demonstrated a long enough period of sobriety to warrant the discharge of this condition.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-106\">\n   J.L. appealed the final agency decision.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-107\">\n   <em>\n    D.C.\n   </em>\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-108\">\n   On June 25, 2008, D.C. pled guilty to second-degree sexual assault, N.J.S.A. 2C:14-2(c)(4), for engaging in sexual acts with a fourteen-year-old girl with the assistance of her aunt. D.C. did not use the Internet in the commission of this offense. D.C. was sentenced to three years' incarceration and was released under PSL on August 31, 2009. Upon his release, D.C. was subject to the social-networking general condition.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-109\">\n   In December 2009, parole authorities found D.C. in possession of a computer and video gaming console. D.C. admitted that he had been using AOL Instant Messenger to communicate with\n   friends, had been using X-Chat (a social-networking website) to get technical assistance on his computer's operating system, and had a YouTube Account. Upon reviewing D.C.'s devices, the parole authorities did not discover any sexually deviant online activity. On January 28, 2010, in lieu of charging D.C. with a parole violation, the Board imposed the no-Internet special condition.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-110\">\n   Since 2010, the Board granted D.C. exceptions to the no-Internet special condition\n   to allow D.C. to use the Internet in relation to his profession as an IT professional, including allowing D.C. to apply for employment online, create an online portfolio, use LinkedIn, and purchase a personal laptop computer to use for job training on web programming. The Board required D.C. to install monitoring software on his personal laptop.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-111\">\n   In December 2016, D.C. appealed the no-Internet and social-networking conditions to the Board, arguing that as he was employed in the IT field, he may need to access other people's computers while making repairs and may need to use blogs, video websites, and social-networking applications to stay up to date with technology and to network himself. In February 2017, a Board panel determined that the social-networking restriction would be held in abeyance and that D.C. would be permitted to access any social-networking service, provided that D.C. disclosed all user names and passwords for every profile. The panel also relaxed the no-Internet condition, instead imposing the notify-computer special condition. Additionally, if D.C. chose to use a computer or Internet-capable device, he was subject to the monitoring special conditions.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-112\">\n   D.C. administratively appealed the panel's decision to the full Board, which affirmed the panel's decision in a final agency decision on May 31, 2017. In its written decision, the Board found that the monitoring special conditions were \"necessary and appropriate to provide for the safety of the public, and minors in particular\" and that \"these provisions are the least restrictive means by which the Division of Parole can monitor [D.C.] for inappropriate Internet and social networking use.\" Further, the\n   Board found that the monitoring special conditions required that D.C. install monitoring software on a device only when the District Parole Supervisor deemed it necessary, and that the Division of Parole had already determined that it was unnecessary to monitor D.C.'s work devices. The Board concluded \"while D.C. has demonstrated a substantial compliance with supervision in general, the time elapsed during which [D.C.] has been responsibly using the Internet and social networking is insufficient to allow for the discharge of the monitoring and password requirements at this time.\"\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-113\">\n   D.C. appealed the final agency decision.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-114\">\n   III.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-115\">\n   (Legal Discussion)\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-116\">\n   \"Our review of the Parole Board's determination[s] is deferential in light of its expertise in the specialized area of parole supervision[.]\"\n   <em>\n    J.I.\n   </em>\n   ,\n   <extracted-citation case-ids=\"12304174\" index=\"57\" url=\"https://cite.case.law/nj/228/204/\">\n    228 N.J. at 230\n   </extracted-citation>\n   ,\n   <extracted-citation case-ids=\"12304174\" index=\"58\" url=\"https://cite.case.law/nj/228/204/\">\n    155 A.3d 1008\n   </extracted-citation>\n   .

In assessing whether C.C. was entitled to a hearing, we consider \"the timing of and justification for the Internet restriction, the severity and length of the restriction, whether facts are contested or uncontested, and whether credibility determinations must be made.\"\n   <em>\n    J.I.\n   </em>\n   ,\n   <extracted-citation case-ids=\"12304174\" index=\"128\" url=\"https://cite.case.law/nj/228/204/\">\n    228 N.J. at 233\n   </extracted-citation>\n   ,\n   <extracted-citation case-ids=\"12304174\" index=\"129\" url=\"https://cite.case.law/nj/228/204/\">\n    155 A.3d 1008\n   </extracted-citation>\n   . These factors distinguish C.C.'s case from the circumstances in\n   <em>\n    J.I.\n   </em>\n   that warranted a hearing. The Board initially imposed the Internet restrictions upon C.C.'s release from incarceration in 2008 for an offense in which he used the Internet to lure a minor. Additionally, in 2016, the Board re-imposed the conditions upon C.C.'s release from incarceration for violating the conditions of his PSL that restricted Internet access. This timing is distinguishable from\n   <em>\n    J.I.\n   </em>\n   , where \"J.I. complied for thirteen months with the Internet conditions set on his release date, and the Parole District Supervisor justified imposing extreme restrictions based on conduct that predated his release.\"\n   <em>\n    <extracted-citation case-ids=\"12304174\" index=\"130\" url=\"https://cite.case.law/nj/228/204/\">\n     Id.\n    </extracted-citation>\n   </em>\n   <extracted-citation case-ids=\"12304174\" index=\"130\" url=\"https://cite.case.law/nj/228/204/\">\n    at 232\n   </extracted-citation>\n   ,\n   <extracted-citation case-ids=\"12304174\" index=\"131\" url=\"https://cite.case.law/nj/228/204/\">\n    155 A.3d 1008\n   </extracted-citation>\n   . Moreover, C.C. did not allege any factual disputes in his administrative appeal to the Board. For these reasons, we conclude that C.C. was not entitled to a hearing to contest the imposition of the conditions.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-148\">\n   We finally reject C.C.'s argument that he was entitled to discovery, as neither the Court in\n   <em>\n    J.I.\n   </em>\n   nor the Board's regulations establish a right to discovery in the agency appeals process.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-149\">\n   C.C. also claims that he was deprived procedural due process because he received an entirely redacted copy of the Board panel's decision sheet in March 2017 and therefore could not adequately challenge the specific factual or legal basis for the\n   panel's decision in his appeal to the Full Board. On the facts of this case, we find that C.C. had sufficient notice of the justification for the imposition of the special conditions, as the conditions were imposed upon his release from incarceration for previous violations of conditions of PSL restricting the use of the Internet and social networking. We note, however, that the Board should ordinarily provide the offender with an unredacted decision sheet, unless it has a substantial security or safety need that requires redaction.\n   <footnotemark>\n    15\n   </footnotemark>\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-150\">\n   <em>\n    J.L.\n   </em>\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-151\">\n   J.L. argues that the social-networking general condition and the notify-computer special condition, as applied to him, violate\n   constitutional protections.

J.L. also contends that all of the aforementioned conditions violate due process under the void for vagueness doctrine. Finally, J.L. argues that the conditions were imposed upon him without sufficient procedural due process because he did not receive a hearing or discovery during the administrative appeal.

We again turn to the factors described in\n   <em>\n    J.I.\n   </em>\n   Like C.C., J.L. used the Internet and social-networking websites to commit the underlying offense. Thus, the Board's need to restrict J.L.'s Internet use is more significant than in\n   <em>\n    J.I.\n   </em>\n   <em>\n    See\n   </em>\n   <extracted-citation case-ids=\"12304174\" index=\"132\" url=\"https://cite.case.law/nj/228/204/\">\n    228 N.J. at 229\n   </extracted-citation>\n   ,\n   <extracted-citation case-ids=\"12304174\" index=\"133\" url=\"https://cite.case.law/nj/228/204/\">\n    155 A.3d 1008\n   </extracted-citation>\n   . Additionally, unlike the no-Internet condition in\n   <em>\n    J.I.\n   </em>\n   , J.L. faces the less restrictive notify-computer special condition and is not currently required to install monitoring software on his devices.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-154\">\n   Under the notify-computer special condition, the Board may authorize J.L. to access the Internet for purposes conducive to rehabilitative needs. In this regard, the notify-computer special condition is a \"less restrictive alternative[ ] ...

The record indicates that two clinical evaluations have deemed that J.L. did not need substance abuse treatment. Further, although J.L's 2009 offense involved the use of alcohol, there is no indication in the record that J.L. has subsequently engaged in offenses involving alcohol or has violated the no-alcohol special condition since June 2015. Moreover, the special condition is broad, prohibiting not only consuming alcohol, but also purchasing alcohol for\n   others and frequenting establishments whose primary purpose is the sale of alcohol.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-161\">\n   In affirming the no-alcohol special condition, the Board found that the condition did not inhibit J.L.'s business activities and that J.L. had not demonstrated a long enough period of sobriety to warrant the discharge of this condition. In light of the clinical evaluations finding that J.L. did not need substance abuse treatment, however, we conclude that these justifications are insufficient to reasonably support such a comprehensive restriction on consuming alcohol, purchasing alcohol, and attending establishments whose primary purpose is the sale of alcohol. We therefore find that the no-alcohol special condition is arbitrary, capricious, and unreasonable as applied to J.L. and reverse the Board's imposition of this condition.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-162\">\n   <em>\n    Void for Vagueness\n   </em>\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-163\">\n   We next consider whether the terms of any of the conditions challenged by J.L. violate due process under the void for vagueness doctrine. Specifically, J.L. contends that the terms \"Internet-capable device,\" \"social networking service,\" \"frequenting establishments whose primary purpose is the sale of alcohol,\" and \"sexually-oriented websites, material, information or data\" are unconstitutionally vague and overbroad.

As to the term \"Internet-capable device,\" common intelligence supports that the term means\n   <em>\n    any\n   </em>\n   device capable of accessing the Internet, whether it be a computer, cell phone, wristwatch, or other device.\n   <footnotemark>\n    17\n   </footnotemark>\n   As to the term \"social networking service,\" the Board's regulations clearly define the terms \"Social networking service,\" \"Chat room,\" \"Internet website or application,\" and \"Peer-to-peer network.\" N.J.A.C. 10A:71-6.12(d)(25)(i) to (iv). As to the terms of the no-alcohol special condition, the second sentence of the provision reads, \"I am to refrain from frequenting establishments whose primary purpose is the sale of alcohol (i.e. bars and liquor stores).\" A plain reading of the provision and the example indicates that the prohibition only applies to bars and liquor stores, not any establishment that sells alcohol. Further, as discussed above, a plain reading of the term \"sexually-oriented materials\" and the corresponding definition in the special condition clearly indicates that the prohibition applies to any medium that contains any actual or simulated description or depiction of sexual intercourse, whether it be a movie, television show, novel, or pornographic website.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-166\">\n   For these reasons, we conclude that none of the challenged terms violate due process under the void for vagueness doctrine. To the extent that any of these conditions are overbroad as applied to an individual offender, that offender may seek that the Board grant an exception to the plain meaning of the condition and may in turn seek judicial review of the Board's decision.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-167\">\n   <em>\n    Procedural Due Process\n   </em>\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-168\">\n   We next address J.L.'s contention that he was deprived procedural due process because the Board denied him a hearing during the administrative appeal. Considering the factors in\n   <em>\n    J.I.\n   </em>\n   , we find that the circumstances did not warrant a hearing. Most notably, J.L.'s underlying offense involved using Facebook to lure a fourteen-year-old girl. J.L. also did not have an extended period of compliance with the conditions of his supervision prior to the October 6, 2016 imposition of the special conditions at issue in this appeal. J.L. was released from a one-year term of incarceration for previous parole violations on May 31, 2016, so he had roughly a five-month period of compliance prior to the imposition of the special conditions. In this regard, the Board's delay in imposing the special conditions is not as egregious as the thirteen-month gap in\n   <em>\n    J.I.\n   </em>\n   <em>\n    See\n   </em>\n   <extracted-citation case-ids=\"12304174\" index=\"161\" url=\"https://cite.case.law/nj/228/204/\">\n    228 N.J. at 232\n   </extracted-citation>\n   ,\n   <extracted-citation case-ids=\"12304174\" index=\"162\" url=\"https://cite.case.law/nj/228/204/\">\n    155 A.3d 1008\n   </extracted-citation>\n   . Moreover, J.L. did not allege any factual disputes in the administrative appeal. For these reasons, we\n   conclude J.L. was not entitled to a hearing in the administrative appeal.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-169\">\n   Finally, as in\n   <em>\n    C.C.\n   </em>\n   , we reject J.L.'s contention that he was entitled to discovery during the administrative appeal. While the Board provided J.L. only with an entirely redacted copy of the panel's decision sheet, J.L. had sufficient notice of the justifications for the imposition of the special conditions through the \"Notice of Special Condition\" forms he was provided when the conditions were imposed.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-170\">\n   <em>\n    D.C.\n   </em>\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-171\">\n   D.C. argues that the notify-computer and monitoring special conditions are both arbitrary and unreasonable, as well as unconstitutional,\n   as applied to him. He also contends that the conditions were imposed upon him without sufficient procedural due process. We agree that the notify-computer and monitoring special conditions are arbitrary and unreasonable as applied to D.C.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-172\">\n   <em>\n    Internet-Access Conditions\n   </em>\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-173\">\n   Turning to the factors in\n   <em>\n    J.I.\n   </em>\n   , we first emphasize that D.C. never used the Internet to commit any crimes. Additionally, as in\n   <em>\n    K.G.\n   </em>\n   , the Board's primary justification for the imposition of the monitoring conditions is D.C.'s previous violations of the social-networking general condition in 2009, but the Board never provided a justification supporting that the social-networking condition was reasonably tailored when it was initially imposed. Moreover, using the monitoring software, the parole authorities have not detected any inappropriate Internet use by D.C. since the monitoring condition was imposed in 2010, significantly diminishing the need for the Board to continue monitoring D.C.'s Internet use.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-174\">\n   Importantly, D.C. also presented the Board with evidence supporting the rehabilitative need for unrestricted Internet access based on his profession in the IT field. In his administrative appeal, D.C. certified, among other things, that: (1) his prospective work in the IT field would require the use of virtual machines that allowed access to other people's servers and computers, (2) running the Board's monitoring software on these machines would create a security risk for clients and possibly interfere with the functioning of the virtual machines, and (3) he would necessarily use encryption software when working for clients. Although the Division of Parole has not yet required D.C. to install monitoring software on his work devices, we find that a parole officer's discretion to relax the monitoring special conditions does not remedy this unnecessary restriction.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-175\">\n   In sum, the record reflects that D.C. did not use the Internet to commit an offense, the Board's monitoring detected no unauthorized Internet use in the seven years prior to its final agency decision, the Board has advanced no significant public safety concern to justify these conditions, and D.C. has presented a\n   rehabilitative need for unrestricted Internet use. For these reasons, we hold that the notify-computer and monitoring special conditions are arbitrary and unreasonable as applied to D.C. and reverse the Board's imposition of these conditions.\n   <footnotemark>\n    18\n   </footnotemark>\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-176\">\n   C.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-177\">\n   (Summary of Conclusions)\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-178\">\n   In summary, in\n   <em>\n    K.G.\n   </em>\n   , (A-0042-16), we reverse the Board's imposition of the no-Internet\n   special condition, the monitoring special conditions, and the social-networking general condition.
