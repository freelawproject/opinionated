In both cases, the trial court held the PIP\n   <footnotemark>\n    1\n   </footnotemark>\n   medical fee schedule does not provide for payment to an ambulatory surgical center (ASC) for procedures not listed\n   as reimbursable when performed at an ASC.

In November 2015, Fiore underwent a lumbar discectomy at the ASC operated by defendant Specialty Surgical Center of North Brunswick (Specialty Surgical). Following the procedure, Specialty Surgical sought $ 32,500 in reimbursement from NJM under CPT code 63030; however, NJM denied payment, claiming the treatment was not medically necessary and further asserting \"the CPT code charged by the facility - 63030 - had no reimbursement value for the ASC on the [F]ee [S]chedule.\"\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-18\">\n   In the second case, Martino Chizzoniti also sustained injury to her lower back in a May 2014 accident involving an automobile. In November 2015, Chizzoniti underwent lumbar decompression surgery at an ASC operated by defendant Surgicare Surgical Associates\n   of Fair Lawn (Surgicare). Following the procedure, Surgicare sought $ 49,000 in reimbursement under Chizzoniti's PIP coverage with NJM for the procedure under CPT code 63030; however, NJM denied reimbursement because \"the CPT code charged by the facility - 63030 - had no reimbursement value for the ASC on the [F]ee [S]chedule.\"\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-19\">\n   In each case, the ASC filed a demand for arbitration with Forthright, Inc. (Forthright),\n   <footnotemark>\n    5\n   </footnotemark>\n   and the parties proceeded to binding arbitration pursuant to N.J.A.C. 11:3-5.1(a) and the PIP endorsement in NJM's policy. After a Forthright DRP and a Forthright appellate panel found against NJM in each case,\n   <footnotemark>\n    6\n   </footnotemark>\n   NJM filed Law Division\n   actions seeking to vacate each award under N.J.S.A. 2A:23A-13 of the Alternative Procedure for Dispute Resolution Act (APDRA),\n   <footnotemark>\n    7\n   </footnotemark>\n   alleging the awards resulted \"from an erroneous and prejudicial application of the law to the facts.\" On August 14, 2017, the trial court filed a final order and written decision in each case, vacating each award and holding that the ASC \"shall receive no reimbursement, of any kind[,] in connection with [ASC] fees for CPT code 63030\" for the surgical procedure in each case. These appeals followed.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-20\">\n   II.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-21\">\n   We first address the applicable jurisdictional constraint set forth in the APDRA. Pursuant to N.J.S.A. 2A:23A-13, a party seeking to vacate, modify, or correct an award may bring \"a summary application\" in the trial court. According to the statute,\n   that judicial scrutiny by the trial court should constitute the final level of appellate review. N.J.S.A. 2A:23A-18(b) provides that \"[u]pon the granting of an order confirming, modifying[,] or correcting an award, a judgment or decree shall be entered by the [trial] court in conformity therewith and be enforced as any other judgment or decree.\n   <em>\n    There shall be no further appeal or review of the judgment or decree.\n   </em>\n   \" (Emphasis added).\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-22\">\n   Based on the explicit language in the statute, \"appellate review is generally not available\" to challenge a trial judge's order issued in cases arising under the APDRA; however, \"there are exceptions.\"\n   <em>\n    Morel v.

Specifically, NJM relies upon N.J.A.C. 11:3-29.4(e), which provides:\n  </p>\n  <blockquote id=\"p-35\">\n   Except as noted in (e)[ (1) ] through (3) below, the insurer's limit of liability for any medical expense benefit for any service or equipment not set forth in or not covered by the fee schedules shall be a reasonable amount considering the [F]ee [S]chedule amount for similar services or equipment in the region where the service or equipment was provided .... The amount that the insurer pays for the service shall be in accordance with this subsection. Where the [F]ee [S]chedule does not contain a reference to similar services or equipment as set forth in the preceding sentence, the insurer's limit of liability for any medical expense benefit for any service or equipment not set forth in the fee schedules shall not exceed the usual, customary[,] and reasonable fee.\n  </blockquote>\n  <blockquote id=\"p-36\">\n   ....\n  </blockquote>\n  <blockquote id=\"p-37\">\n   3. Codes in [the Fee Schedule] that do not have an amount in the ASC facility fee column are not reimbursable if performed in an ASC and are not subject to the provision in (e) above concerning services not set forth in or covered by the fee schedules.\n  </blockquote>\n  <p id=\"p-38\">\n   NJM supports its position by citing the Department's responses to commenters during the notice and comment period for the Fee Schedule, as well as the following question and answer posted on the Department's website, under \"Auto Medical Fee Schedule Frequently Asked Questions\":\n  </p>\n  <blockquote id=\"p-39\">\n   [Question] 6. There is no fee in the ASC facility fee column of [the Fee Schedule] for the service I want to provide in an ASC.\n  </blockquote>\n  <blockquote id=\"p-40\">\n   [Department Response.] N.J.A.C. 11:3-29.5(a) and 29.4(e)(3) state that when there is no fee in the ASC facility fee column of [the Fee Schedule] for a service, the facility fee for that service is not reimbursable if performed in an ASC. Stated another way, the only facility fees that are reimbursable for services performed in an ASC are those CPT and HCPCS codes that have facility fees listed in the ASC Facility Fee Column of [the Fee Schedule]. The fact that, subsequent to the promulgation of the fee schedule rule, CMS may have authorized additional procedures to be performed in an ASC does not permit an ASC to be reimbursed for those services unless there is an amount listed in the ASC Fee Column on [the Fee Schedule] for the corresponding CPT code ....\n  </blockquote>\n  <p id=\"p-41\">\n   Thus, NJM argues:\n  </p>\n  <blockquote id=\"p-42\">\n   [W]hile an ASC may receive payment for hosting a spine surgery for a CMS/Medicare patient, these services are not payable to ASCs under New Jersey PIP. Stated another way, an ASC may host a procedure utilizing the \"new\" spine surgery codes[,] but it cannot be paid by a No-Fault insurer.\n  </blockquote>\n  <p id=\"p-43\">\n   NJM further asserts that because of this court's deference to an agency's interpretation of its own rules, the Department guidance \"definitely resolves\" the instant matter.\n   <em>\n    See\n   </em>\n   <em>\n    N.J.

Significantly, that proposal included CPT code 63030; however, it provided for reimbursement to physicians only - it did not provide for reimbursement to ASCs.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-47\">\n   The regulation was reproposed on February 21, 2012, with substantial changes, apparently based on comments the Department received. The Department then excluded 117 CPT codes relating to neurosurgery, and provided the following explanation:\n  </p>\n  <blockquote id=\"p-48\">\n   Amendments are also proposed to ... the Physicians' and Ambulatory Surgical Center Facility Fee Schedule, to delete physician fees for 117 CPT codes for low-frequency, high-cost procedures performed by neurosurgeons and spinal surgeons that were added in the proposal. Comments submitted on the proposal provided data indicating that there are only approximately [eighty] such specialists currently practicing in New Jersey. Consequently, and as was noted in the proposal, the available data on the fees paid to these providers for these low-frequency procedures is limited. For this reason, the Department has determined that caution is warranted and further study of more comprehensive data is needed before a final conclusion is reached to include these codes on the Physicians' Fee Schedule. Accordingly, [the Fee Schedule] is proposed to be amended upon adoption to delete the physician fees for the 117 CPT codes referenced above. CPT codes for which there is no amount in the Physicians' Fee column of [the Fee Schedule] are reimbursed at the usual, customary, and reasonable fee for the service. Forty-two of the 117 codes remain in [the Fee Schedule] because, although there is no physician fee for the code, there is an ASC facility fee for that code. The Department will make a further study of the issues raised in these comments as part of its biennial review of the fee schedules required by N.J.S.A. 39:6A-4.6.\n  </blockquote>\n  <blockquote id=\"p-49\">\n   [44 N.J.R. 383(a).]\n  </blockquote>\n  <p id=\"p-50\">\n   In November 2012, after the adoption of the Fee Schedule at issue, the Department responded to a comment as follows:\n  </p>\n  <blockquote id=\"p-51\">\n   Upon review of the comments received, the Department has determined that additional\n   study of the physician fees for 117 CPT codes on the Physicians' Fee Schedule for spinal and neurosurgical procedures is required. As was noted in the proposal, the available data on the fees paid to providers for these low-frequency procedures is limited. As was referenced in the notice of proposed substantial changes, the Department is removing the fees for these codes from the Physicians' Fee Schedule upon adoption until this issue can be studied further.\n  </blockquote>\n  <blockquote id=\"p-52\">\n   [44 N.J.R. 2652(c).]\n  </blockquote>\n  <p id=\"p-53\">\n   Thus, when the regulation was proposed originally, CPT code 63030 provided for reimbursement to doctors but not to ASCs. Then the Department removed code 63030 and other codes from the Fee Schedule for doctors because it did not have enough experience to have confidence that the reimbursement numbers were sound. This history indicates the Department did not intend to require that ASC's should receive reimbursement for code\n   63030 procedures. That position is consistent with the Department's answer to frequently-asked question number six.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-54\">\n   We conclude that ASCs should not receive reimbursement for CPT code 63030 procedures because no reimbursement was listed in the ASC columns in the Fee Schedule, as originally proposed. This omission provides a clear indication of the Department's intent not to reimburse ASCs for CPT code 63030 procedures. The fact that Medicare now includes the CPT code does not result in the automatic amendment of the Fee Schedule; instead, we conclude it is the Department, not Medicare, that amends the Fee Schedule.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-55\">\n   Any arguments not specifically addressed lack sufficient merit to warrant discussion in a written opinion.\n   <em>\n    R.\n   </em>\n   2:11-3(e)(1)(E).\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-56\">\n   Affirmed.\n  </p>\n  <footnote label=\"1\">\n   <p id=\"p-59\">\n    PIP refers to personal injury protection coverage, which auto insurers must provide in \"every standard automobile liability insurance policy.\" N.J.S.A. 39:6A-4.\n   </p>\n  </footnote>\n  <footnote label=\"2\">\n   <p id=\"p-60\">\n    Exhibit 1 is titled \"Physician's &amp; Ambulatory Surgical Center (ASC) Facility Fee Schedule\" (the Fee Schedule).\n   </p>\n  </footnote>\n  <footnote label=\"3\">\n   <p id=\"p-61\">\n    CPT stands for Current Procedural Terminology.\n   </p>\n  </footnote>\n  <footnote label=\"4\">\n   <p id=\"p-62\">\n    CPT code 63030 does appear in Exhibit 7 of the Appendix, which lists \"hospital outpatient facility fees.\" N.J.A.C. 11:3-29.5(b).\n   </p>\n  </footnote>\n  <footnote label=\"5\">\n   <p id=\"p-63\">\n    Forthright is \"the organization that contractually provides the State with [Dispute Resolution Professionals ( ]DRPs[ ) ] who hear PIP matters ....\"\n    <em>\n     Kimba Med.
