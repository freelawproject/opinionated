On appeal, the defendant claims that the court erred by concluding that he had failed to satisfy his burden of proving that the mortgage broker was an agent or employee of the original mortgagee and concluding, on that basis, that he had failed to prove any of his special defenses, all of which were based on the alleged conduct of the broker. The defendant further claims that the trial court incorrectly concluded that he had failed to sustain his burden of proving that the mortgage was unconscionable.\n   <footnotemark>\n    2\n   </footnotemark>\n   We\n   disagree with the defendant and, accordingly, affirm the judgment of the trial court.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-11\">\n   The following facts and procedural history are relevant to the resolution of the defendant's claims on appeal. The plaintiff filed this action in August, 2013, seeking to foreclose a residential mortgage on property located at 80 Oakwood Street in Bridgeport. According to the complaint, on March 20, 2006, the defendant executed\n   the mortgage in favor of Mortgage Electronic Registration Systems, Inc., as nominee for Mortgage Capital Group, LLC (Mortgage Capital), as security for a $ 267,750 promissory note payable to the order of Mortgage Capital. The complaint alleged that the note was in default and that the plaintiff, which was in possession of the note, was exercising its option to declare the entire balance of the note due and payable.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-12\">\n   On June 25, 2015, the defendant filed an amended answer and six special defenses. The special defenses alleged fraudulent inducement, negligent misrepresentation, equitable estoppel, unconscionability, duress and unclean hands. Each of the special defenses alleged misconduct by David J. Bigley, an alleged employee and/or agent of the original lender and mortgagee, Mortgage Capital.\n   <footnotemark>\n    3\n   </footnotemark>\n   On May 5, 2016, the plaintiff filed its reply,\n   denying each of the defendant's special defenses. Following a trial on April 18 and 19, 2017, the court rendered a judgment of strict foreclosure.\n   <footnotemark>\n    4\n   </footnotemark>\n   In its oral decision, the court found that the plaintiff had presented prima facie evidence to support the judgment of strict foreclosure. The court rejected the defendant's special defenses, finding that the defendant had not satisfied his burden of proving that Bigley was an agent or employee of Mortgage Capital. The defendant then filed the present appeal.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-13\">\n   We first set forth our standard of review. \"The standard of review of a judgment of ... strict foreclosure is whether the trial court abused its discretion....

Curcio also referred the defendant to Attorney Thomas V. Battaglia, Jr., to represent him in the purchase of the property. Bigley, a mortgage broker doing business as Main Street Mortgage, LLC, assisted the defendant with securing financing to purchase the house.\n   <footnotemark>\n    6\n   </footnotemark>\n   Bigley obtained a lender, Mortgage Capital, who was not disclosed to the defendant until the date of the closing.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-21\">\n   The defendant testified that he paid $ 40,000 as a deposit on the property. He testified that when he first met Bigley, he told Bigley that he could only afford a mortgage in the amount of $ 1250 per month. On the date of the closing, however, he was told that his monthly payment would be $ 2618.16 per month and that if he did not proceed with the transaction, he would lose $ 20,000 of his deposit. At that point, Bigley agreed to loan the defendant the shortfall of $ 16,000 to complete the closing. The defendant was not informed that Bigley held a mortgage on the property from Sunrise Contracting, LLC, the seller of the property, in the amount of $ 249,600, that would be paid off with the proceeds of the sale to the defendant. The mortgage from Sunrise Contracting, LLC, to Bigley was witnessed by Battaglia who, unbeknownst to the defendant, was Bigley's cousin.\n   <footnotemark>\n    7\n   </footnotemark>\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-22\">\n   In addition to the defendant's testimony, the court considered several exhibits that were admitted into evidence. Specifically, the mortgage loan origination agreement, signed by the defendant on January 30, 2006, identified Main Street Mortgage, LLC, as an independent contractor and licensed mortgage broker under the laws\n   of the state of Connecticut. This document provided in relevant part: \"In connection with this mortgage loan we are acting as an independent contractor and not as your agent. We will enter into separate independent contractor agreements with various lenders.\" Similarly, the mortgage broker fee disclosure, signed by the defendant on January 30, 2006, provided in relevant part: \"The mortgage broker will submit your application for a residential mortgage loan to a participating lender with which it from time to time contracts upon such\n   terms and conditions as you may request or a lender may require.... The mortgage broker may be acting as an independent contractor and not as your agent. If you are unsure of the nature of your relationship, please ask the mortgage broker for clarification.... The mortgage broker has entered into separate independent contractor agreements with various lenders.\" Finally, the mortgage broker fee disclosure also provided: \"You may work with the mortgage broker to select the method [by] which it receives its compensation depending on your financial needs, subject to the lender's program requirements and credit underwriting guidelines.\" The \"Good Faith Estimate,\" also signed by the defendant on January 30, 2006, provided that it was \"being provided by Main Street Mortgage, LLC, a mortgage broker, and no lender has yet been obtained.\"\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-23\">\n   On cross-examination, the defendant testified that he had no evidence that Mortgage Capital set Bigley's hours or supplied any office supplies to Bigley. He further testified that he had no evidence that Mortgage Capital provided or told Bigley who to get as customers. Finally, the defendant testified that he did not read any of the closing documents.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-24\">\n   In its oral decision at the conclusion of the trial, the court stated: \"The defenses basically rely on an allegation that Bigley induced the defendant to enter into this mortgage. In order to prove each or any of the special defenses, the defendant had to prove that Bigley [was] an agent or employee of the originating lender, the originating lender being Mortgage Capital ... [and] the court will find that the evidence showed that Bigley, at that time, was not an agent or employee of Mortgage Capital .... Bigley acted as an independent contractor who worked for and owned, according to Battaglia's statement, Main Street Mortgage, LLC, and that's who Bigley was working for. The defendant, in order to make out or prove any of these special\n   defenses, had to establish a link, connection between Bigley, the broker, and the lender. And the evidence, credible evidence, just didn't show that.\"\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-25\">\n   The court further stated that Mortgage Capital \"had little control over the actions of ... Bigley. Bigley was not acting for the sole benefit of [Mortgage Capital] and [it] did not ... provide the instrumentalities, the tools, or place of work for the broker and all of that tends to prove the lack of an agency relationship.\" The court continued by stating that \"another important factor ... is that neither the plaintiff nor [Mortgage Capital], according to the evidence, told the defendant anything. All the allegations, which [the defendant] testified to, are against Bigley, and there's no evidence that the plaintiff or [Mortgage Capital] made any representations to [the defendant] at all. Now the court is not unsympathetic to the position and the predicament that [the defendant] found himself in, but based upon the evidence and the credible evidence that's been presented, again, the ... special defenses simply aren't supported. And the fact that [the defendant] has testified that he didn't read these various documents is not a defense.\"\n   <footnotemark>\n    8\n   </footnotemark>\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-26\">\n   In support of its decision, the court relied on\n   <em>\n    CitiMortgage, Inc.\n   </em>\n   v.\n   <em>\n    Coolbeth\n   </em>\n   , supra,\n   <extracted-citation case-ids=\"12415270\" index=\"30\" url=\"https://cite.case.law/conn-app/147/183/#p192\">\n    147 Conn.

Although the defendant argues that Mortgage Capital communicated with him exclusively through Bigley and that Mortgage Capital had the power to control the means by which such communications were to be made, there is no evidence that it knew of or promoted the line of communication between Bigley and the defendant. Furthermore, there is no evidence indicating that the defendant knew of or relied upon any statement or action of Mortgage Capital when he entered into the transaction at issue; the defendant, rather, testified that he did not learn that Mortgage Capital was the lender until the date of the closing. \"It is not within the province of this court to 'connect the dots' \" to find that Bigley was an agent of Mortgage Capital.\n   <em>\n    CitiMortgage, Inc.\n   </em>\n   v.\n   <em>\n    Coolbeth\n   </em>\n   , supra,\n   <extracted-citation case-ids=\"12415270\" index=\"37\" url=\"https://cite.case.law/conn-app/147/183/#p192\">\n    147 Conn.

The special defenses did not allege that Battaglia was an agent or employee of Mortgage Capital. Furthermore, the court's decision focused solely on whether Bigley was an agent or employee of Mortgage Capital, and did not make a finding regarding whether Battaglia was an agent or employee of Mortgage Capital. The defendant did not file a motion for articulation regarding whether Battaglia was an agent or employee of Mortgage Capital. \"Without the necessary factual and legal conclusions furnished by the trial court, either on its own or in response to a proper motion for articulation, any decision made by us ... would be entirely speculative.\" (Internal quotation marks omitted.)\n    <em>\n     Bayview Loan Servicing, LLC\n    </em>\n    v.\n    <em>\n     Park City Sports, LLC\n    </em>\n    ,\n    <extracted-citation case-ids=\"12496016\" index=\"40\" url=\"https://cite.case.law/a3d/184/1277/#p781\">\n     180 Conn.

They were signed. Some of them signed in multiple places and multiple times, and the documents speak for themselves and ... contradict the special defenses.\" According to the defendant, these statements indicate that, because the documents \"speak for themselves,\" the court failed to consider the credibility of the defendant's testimony in light of all of the evidence presented. We disagree with the defendant's narrow reading of the court's decision, which states that \"based upon the ... credible evidence that's been presented,\" the defendant had not proven his special defenses.\n   </p>\n  </footnote>\n  <footnote label=\"9\">\n   <p id=\"p-39\">\n    This conclusion is dispositive of the defendant's separately briefed claims that the court's finding that Bigley was not an agent of Mortgage Capital was clearly erroneous and that the court's ultimate conclusion that he had failed to satisfy his burden of proving each of his special defenses was improper. The defendant further argues, however, that the court incorrectly concluded that he had failed to sustain his burden of proving that the mortgage was unconscionable. In support of this argument, the defendant attempts to distinguish the present case from\n    <em>\n     CitiMortgage, Inc.\n    </em>\n    v.\n    <em>\n     Coolbeth\n    </em>\n    , supra,\n    <extracted-citation case-ids=\"12415270\" index=\"44\" url=\"https://cite.case.law/conn-app/147/183/#p192\">\n     147 Conn.

The defendant further points out that\n    <em>\n     CitiMortgage, Inc.\n    </em>\n    , involved a refinance rather than the purchase of a home, while in this case, the defendant lost his home and the $ 40,000 he paid because the mortgage was completely unaffordable. Under these circumstances, the defendant argues that a finding of procedural unconscionability was not required and the status of Bigley as an agent was irrelevant. We disagree.\n   </p>\n   <p id=\"p-40\">\n    \"The doctrine of unconscionability, as a defense to contract enforcement, generally requires a showing that the contract was both procedurally and substantively unconscionable when made-i.e., some showing of an absence of meaningful choice on the part of one of the parties together with contract terms which are unreasonably favorable to the other party ....\" (Internal quotation marks omitted.)\n    <em>\n     Hirsch\n    </em>\n    v.\n    <em>\n     Woermer\n    </em>\n    ,\n    <extracted-citation case-ids=\"12502481\" index=\"46\" url=\"https://cite.case.law/a3d/195/1182/#p588\">\n     184 Conn.
