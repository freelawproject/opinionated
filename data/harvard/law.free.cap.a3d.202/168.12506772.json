Breyan (Breyan) petitions this Court for review of a December 20, 2017 letter issued by the Department of Conservation and Natural Resources (DCNR) refusing to grant him a hearing to contest DCNR's refusal to provide him benefits pursuant to the law commonly known as the Heart and Lung Act (HLA), Act of June 28, 1935, P.L. 477,\n   <em>\n    as amended\n   </em>\n   , 53 P.S. \u00a7\u00a7 637 - 638. Upon review, we conclude that DCNR's December 20th letter is not an appealable adjudication because Breyan does not have a personal or property right that DCNR affected when it informed him that he is not entitled to benefits under the HLA. Accordingly, we dismiss Breyan's petition for review.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-10\">\n   DCNR is an administrative agency\n   <footnotemark>\n    1\n   </footnotemark>\n   of the Commonwealth of Pennsylvania which employed Breyan as a ranger. Petition \u00b6\u00b6 2-3. On March 9, 2017, Breyan was injured in the performance of his duties as a ranger and temporarily disabled from performing his duties. Petition \u00b6 10. On September 29, 2017, Breyan submitted a request\n   to DCNR requesting that he be compensated in accordance with the HLA during his period of disability or, alternatively, requesting that a hearing be held on his claim. Petition \u00b6 11. By letter dated October 11, 2017, Breyan was informed that he is not eligible for HLA benefits but, as a ranger, is eligible for \"work-related disability leave\" under the Pennsylvania State Rangers Association contract.\n   <em>\n    See\n   </em>\n   10/11/17 letter from Work-Related Injury Specialist with the Office of Administration, Judy K. Watterson. In response, Breyan, through counsel, by letter dated October 17, 2017, requested a hearing pursuant to the Administrative Agency Law, 2 Pa. C.S. \u00a7\u00a7 501 - 508, 701 - 704.\n   <em>\n    See\n   </em>\n   10/17/17 letter by Attorney Sean T. Welby to Secretary of DCNR, Cindy Adams Dunn. DCNR responded to Breyan's request advising him that the HLA \"does not identify DCNR [r]anger as a position eligible\" for benefits and, therefore, he was not entitled to benefits or a hearing on the matter.\n   <em>\n    See\n   </em>\n   12/20/17 letter by Deputy Secretary of DCNR, Michael A. Walsh.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-11\">\n   Breyan petitioned this Court for review. DCNR responded with an application for relief seeking dismissal due to lack of jurisdiction. In its application, DCNR argued that Breyan does not have a property interest in the benefits, and therefore, the December 20th letter does not constitute an adjudication and, consequently, it is not appealable.\n   <em>\n    See\n   </em>\n   Application for Relief in the Form of a Motion to Dismiss for Want of Jurisdiction \u00b6 16. By order dated April 9, 2018, this Court denied DCNR's request to dismiss the matter, explaining that \"DCNR's argument is inextricably intertwined with the merits of whether or not DCNR [p]ark [r]angers are eligible for benefits under the Act.\" Cmwlth. Ct. Order dated 4/9/18. This Court ordered further briefing and asked the parties to address whether the December 20th letter is an adjudication and to address the merits of Breyan's claim that he is entitled to benefits under the HLA.\n   <footnotemark>\n    2\n   </footnotemark>\n   <em>\n    Id.\n   </em>\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-12\">\n   In his brief, Breyan asserts that DCNR's December 20th letter constituted an \"invalid adjudication under the Administrative Agency Law\" because DCNR refused to provide him with a hearing to determine his eligibility for HLA benefits. Breyan's Brief at 7. Breyan contends that he is eligible for HLA benefits because, as a DCNR ranger, he has \"all of the authority and all of the rights of a member of a police force of a city of the first class.\"\n   <em>\n    Id.\n   </em>\n   DCNR responds that Breyan is not entitled to HLA benefits because \"only those classes of employees specifically enumerated in the HLA are entitled to HLA benefits\" and rangers are not one of those classes of employees. DCNR's Brief at 6. DCNR asserts that because Breyan is not entitled to HLA benefits, he lacks a property interest in the benefits and \"[a]bsent an affected property interest,\" DCNR's December 20th letter does not constitute an \"appealable adjudication,\" and therefore, the petition for review must be dismissed.\n   <footnotemark>\n    3\n   </footnotemark>\n   <em>\n    Id.\n   </em>\n   Upon review, we agree.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-13\">\n   The Administrative Agency Law requires that an administrative agency provide an aggrieved party with an opportunity to be heard at a hearing before issuing an adjudication or final order. 2 Pa. C.S. \u00a7 504 (providing, \"no\n   <em>\n    adjudication\n   </em>\n   of a\n   <em>\n    Commonwealth agency shall be valid\n   </em>\n   as to\n   any party unless he shall have been afforded reasonable notice of a hearing and an opportunity to be heard\");\n   <em>\n    see also\n   </em>\n   <em>\n    Callahan v.

C.S. \u00a7 702 ;\n   <em>\n    see\n   </em>\n   <em>\n    Malehorn v.

Cmwlth. 2015) (noting correspondence is not an adjudication). An \"adjudication\" is defined as:\n  </p>\n  <blockquote id=\"p-14\">\n   [a]ny final order, decree, decision, determination or ruling\n   <em>\n    by an agency affecting personal or property rights,\n   </em>\n   privileges, immunities, duties, liabilities or obligations of any or all of the parties to the proceeding in which the adjudication is made.\n  </blockquote>\n  <p id=\"p-15\">\n   2 Pa. C.S. \u00a7 101 (emphasis added). As plainly stated, for the action of an agency to be deemed an \"adjudication,\" a two-prong test must be met. First, the agency must have issued a \"final order, decree, decision, determination or ruling\" and, second, that \"final order, decree, decision, determination or ruling\" must affect the \"personal or property rights\" of a party. 2 Pa. C.S. \u00a7 101 ;\n   <em>\n    NHS Human Servs. of Pa. v. Dep't of Pub.

Cmwlth. 2009).\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-16\">\n   We conclude that the December 20th letter was not an \"adjudication\" because DCNR did not render a decision \"affecting [Breyan's] personal or property rights\" when it refused to provide Breyan with a hearing because, as a matter of law, Breyan is not entitled to HLA benefits.\n   <em>\n    See\n   </em>\n   <em>\n    Malehorn\n   </em>\n   ,\n   <extracted-citation case-ids=\"6897418\" index=\"4\" url=\"https://cite.case.law/a3d/106/816/6897418/#p820\">\n    106 A.3d at 819\n   </extracted-citation>\n   (stating, \"[t]o have a property interest in a benefit or a privilege that is protected by procedural due process,\" one must have more than a unilateral expectation, but rather \"a legitimate claim of entitlement to it\");\n   <em>\n    Greenstein v.

There is no legitimate basis in the law to equate a Commonwealth ranger with a policeman of a county, city, borough, town or township.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-17\">\n   The HLA expressly enumerates 13 types of employees that are entitled to a \"full rate of salary\" while temporarily incapacitated until the disability arising from a work-related injury has ceased. 53 P.S. \u00a7 637.\n   <footnotemark>\n    4\n   </footnotemark>\n   Of the employees listed, Breyan\n   asserts that, as a ranger, he is a \"policeman\" as that term is used in Section 1(a)(10) of the HLA. 53 P.S. \u00a7 637(a)(10). Breyan argues that Section 303(a)(7)(ii) of the Conservation and Natural Resources Act, Act of June 28, 1995, P.L. 89,\n   <em>\n    as amended\n   </em>\n   , provides DCNR rangers with \"all the powers and prerogatives conferred by law upon members of the police force of cities of the first class.\" 71 P.S. \u00a7 1340.303(a)(7)(ii).\n   <footnotemark>\n    5\n   </footnotemark>\n   Breyan argues that the Conservation and Natural Resources Act therefore extends the benefits of the HLA \"as a universal protection for hazardous public safety employees to those it appoints as police.\" Breyan's Brief at 12.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-18\">\n   The provision of the HLA upon which Breyan relies applies only to \"any policeman\" of \"\n   <em>\n    any county, city, borough, town or township\n   </em>\n   .\" 53 P.S. \u00a7 637(a)(10) (emphasis added). Its plain language does not include DCNR rangers.\n   <em>\n    See\n   </em>\n   53 P.S. \u00a7 637(a)(10) ; 1 Pa. C.S. \u00a7 1921(b) (stating, \"[w]hen the words of a statute are clear and free from all ambiguity, the letter of it is not to be disregarded under the pretext of pursuing its spirit\");\n   <em>\n    Jones v. County of Washington\n   </em>\n   ,\n   <extracted-citation case-ids=\"11636583\" index=\"6\" url=\"https://cite.case.law/a2d/725/255/\">\n    725 A.2d 255\n   </extracted-citation>\n   (Pa. Cmwlth. 1999) (applying strict construction to HLA and holding that a deputy sheriff was not entitled to benefits because his position was not among the enumerated class of employees). Further, the HLA specifically provides that a policeman \"shall be paid ...\n   <em>\n    by the county, township or municipality, by which he is employed\n   </em>\n   , his full rate of salary.\" 53 P.S. \u00a7 637(a) (emphasis added). Breyan, by his own assertion, is employed by DCNR, which is a Commonwealth administrative agency, not a county, township or municipality. Petition \u00b6 2. Regardless of the nature of his duties and the powers he possesses as a DCNR ranger, Breyan cannot claim benefits under the HLA because he is not employed by a \"county, city, borough, town or township.\" A hearing to make findings of fact would not aid DCNR or this Court in reaching an alternate conclusion given that the plain language of the HLA does not entitle Breyan to the requested benefits as a matter of law.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-19\">\n   Because Breyan had no property right to be affected, we conclude that DCNR did not issue an adjudication when it informed Breyan, through the December 20th letter, that he had no legitimate claim or entitlement to the requested HLA benefits or to a hearing on the matter. Given that Breyan is not aggrieved by an adjudication of DCNR, there is no basis upon which an appeal may lie. 2 Pa.
