Following oral argument, however, this court stayed the appeal pending the decision of the United States Supreme Court in\n   <em>\n    Carpenter\n   </em>\n   and ordered the parties to submit supplemental briefs concerning the relevance of that decision to this appeal. In light of the court's holding in\n   <em>\n    Carpenter\n   </em>\n   , we conclude that, because the state obtained the defendant's historical CSLI solely on the basis of a reasonable and\n   articulable suspicion, rather than on a warrant supported by probable cause, the records were obtained in violation of the defendant's fourth amendment rights. We further conclude that the trial court properly determined that suppression of both the historical and prospective CSLI-which the state concedes it obtained in violation of \u00a7 54-47aa-was the appropriate remedy. Finally, we conclude that the trial court properly rejected the state's reliance on the inevitable discovery doctrine. Accordingly, we affirm the judgments of the trial court.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-10\">\n   The record reveals the following facts and procedural background. From July 30 through November 23, 2010,\n   Connecticut State Police Detective Patrick Meehan was a member of a task force investigating a series of burglaries and attempted burglaries at a variety of gas stations and convenience stores in the New Haven, Waterbury and Fairfield areas. In the late night and early morning hours, the thieves targeted businesses that had freestanding ATMs inside a windowed store-front. Using a stolen vehicle, in many instances a Dodge Caravan minivan, the thieves backed the vehicle into the building when the business was closed, smashing through the glass and, in many cases, knocking over the ATM. The thieves would then load the ATM into the back of the vehicle, from which the rear seats had been removed, and drive away. Several of the ATMs had subsequently been recovered; those machines appeared to have been cut open with a reciprocating saw. Three of the ATMs were recovered in a cemetery not far from where the defendant lived. The stolen vehicles were later abandoned in different locations from where the ATMs had been discarded.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-11\">\n   Following a task force meeting on September 15, 2010, Meehan learned that, on or about May 26, 2009, a police officer patrolling in the town of Monroe had observed a Dodge Caravan swerve over the double yellow line in the road several times. The officer pulled the Caravan over and, because there was heavy traffic, directed the driver to a nearby parking lot. As the driver of the Caravan began to pull into the parking lot, a Lincoln Navigator pulled up alongside the Caravan. The Lincoln's driver briefly spoke to the driver of the Caravan, then drove away. The Caravan continued into the parking lot but, while the van was still in gear, the driver opened the door and fled on foot. Although the officers attempted to pursue the driver, he was never apprehended or identified. The rear seats of the Caravan, which had been stolen in Bridgeport just prior to the incident, had been removed. The Lincoln Navigator was\n   stopped moments later. At the time of the stop, the defendant, who was driving that vehicle, informed the officers that he was a student at Southern Connecticut State University (Southern) and played for the football team. After being questioned by the officers, the defendant was allowed to leave.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-12\">\n   Meehan subsequently began investigating the defendant. From the campus police at Southern, Meehan obtained the defendant's cell phone number and his address in New Haven, a location not far from where a couple of the stolen vehicles had been recovered. When Meehan ran a criminal history check on the defendant, he discovered that he previously had been convicted of burglary and larceny. Specifically, the defendant had been convicted of committing two burglaries over the course of several weeks at a gun shop. Of particular interest to Meehan was the fact that the defendant had used a vehicle to smash through the front door to enter the shop.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-13\">\n   On October 4, 2010, Meehan and other police officers conducted overnight surveillance of the defendant. Sometime after 10\n   p.m., they observed the defendant leave his house, get into his car and drive to the cemetery where three of the stolen ATMs had been recovered approximately two weeks earlier. The officers followed him to the cemetery, where he remained for a few minutes. He then returned to his home and did not leave for the rest of the night.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-14\">\n   On the basis of all of this information, Meehan obtained the first of the three ex parte orders that are the subject of this appeal and which was the sole order that authorized the disclosure of historical cell phone records. In this first ex parte order, issued on October 22, 2010, the court,\n   <em>\n    Holden, J.\n   </em>\n   , directed T-Mobile Communications\n   (T-Mobile)\n   <footnotemark>\n    4\n   </footnotemark>\n   to disclose telephone records, including basic subscriber information and call identifying information, pertaining to the defendant's cell phone number for the period of July 29 to September 29, 2010. The order specified that basic subscriber information included \"name, address, local and long distant telephone connection records, records of session times and durations, length of service (including start date, and types of service utilized), telephone or instrument number, other subscriber number or identity, assigned internet protocol addresses, and means and source of payment for such service including any credit card or bank account number.\" \"Call identifying information\" included \"dialing or signaling information that identifies the origin, direction, destination or termination of each communication generated or received by a subscriber or customer by means of any equipment, facility or service of telecommunications carrier.\" The order also directed the disclosure of \"cellular site/tower information including addresses of cellular towers ....\"\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-15\">\n   The remaining two ex parte orders were prospective in nature. In the second order, issued on November 15, 2010, the court,\n   <em>\n    Shaban, J.\n   </em>\n   , directed T-Mobile to disclose call identifying information for the defendant's cell phone number, including live updates from T-Mobile on cell phone pings every ten minutes between midnight and 6 a.m. on both November 16 and 17, 2010. In the third order, issued on November 22, 2010, the court,\n   <em>\n    Cremins, J.\n   </em>\n   , directed T-Mobile to disclose call identifying information for the defendant's cell phone number, including \"E911 pings,\" every ten minutes from midnight on November 23, 2010 until 7 a.m. on November 25, 2010.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-16\">\n   From the records disclosed as a result of the October 22, 2010 order, following consultation with other officers who assisted in the analysis of the records, Meehan noticed that, during the period between July 29 and September 29, 2010, the defendant's daily cell phone calls ordinarily stopped sometime between 10 and 11 p.m. There were some exceptions to that general pattern-certain days when the defendant made several phone calls between 2 and 4 a.m. Those dates and times coincided with the dates on which there had been attempted or completed ATM burglaries. In addition, Meehan observed that the location information recovered from the cell phone records often \"match[ed] ... up\" with the location of the burglaries or attempts that had occurred on a given date. That is, during the time period of the burglaries, the defendant's cell phone records showed that his phone was pinging off of nearby cell towers.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-17\">\n   Meehan particularly focused on the defendant's phone records for the early morning hours of September 28, 2010, when two attempted or completed ATM burglaries had occurred, both of which had involved stolen vans smashing through storefronts. An ATM was removed from a business in Shelton at approximately 2:15 a.m., and there was an attempt to steal an ATM in Ansonia at 5:04 a.m. At the time that these two incidents occurred, six phone calls were exchanged between the defendant's cell phone and a New Jersey telephone number. Meehan discovered that the New Jersey telephone number was registered under the name \"Ollie Twig.\"\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-18\">\n   On November 23, 2010, Meehan reported to the Wallingford Police Department, where a suspect, Ramon Johnson, had been arrested and taken into custody in connection with an ATM burglary. The police had located Johnson as a result of the real time tracking of the defendant's CSLI on that date, pursuant to the\n   prospective ex parte order granted on November 22, 2010. During his interview of Johnson, Meehan learned that Johnson, like the defendant, was a student at Southern and a member of the school's football team. Johnson informed Meehan that, when not at school, he lived in New Jersey with his grandmother, Ollie Twig. At that point, Meehan showed Johnson the defendant's phone log for September 28, 2010, which he had obtained pursuant to the October 22, 2010 order, and in the margins of which Meehan had written \"Ollie Twig\" and drawn arrows pointing to the New Jersey phone number that the defendant had been calling when the Shelton burglary and the Ansonia attempted burglary were taking place. Johnson admitted that the phone number in the log was his and gave a statement implicating himself and the defendant in connection with the series of ATM burglaries and attempted burglaries.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-19\">\n   The defendant was subsequently arrested and charged in thirteen separate informations under thirteen different docket numbers, with committing numerous offenses, including burglary, attempt to commit burglary, conspiracy to commit burglary, larceny, conspiracy to commit larceny, criminal mischief and possession of burglar tools. See footnote 2 of this opinion. The defendant filed motions to suppress any and all \"cellular-telephone-derived location information,\" both historical and prospective in nature, as well as any evidence found to be the fruit of such information, including any potential testimony by Johnson.\n   <footnotemark>\n    5\n   </footnotemark>\n   Included in the evidence considered by the trial court during the suppression hearing were stipulated facts submitted by the parties, including: \"As a result of the real time\n   tracking of the defendant through the monitoring of [his] cell site location data, the police were able to track the defendant's activities on November 23, 2010, and to thereby locate [Johnson].... But for the ability of the police to track [the defendant's] movements by monitoring [his] cell phone on a real time basis, Johnson would never have been stopped, detained, arrested or interrogated by the police on November 23, 2010.\"\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-20\">\n   Following the suppression hearing, the trial court granted the defendant's motions to suppress in all of the cases pending against him. In its memorandum of decision, the court acknowledged that the defendant's motions implicated both statutory\n   and constitutional principles, but, because the constitutional question of whether the ex parte orders violated the defendant's fourth amendment rights had not yet been clearly settled, the court first considered whether the ex parte orders violated \u00a7 54-47aa, and, if so, whether suppression was the proper remedy.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-21\">\n   As to the prospective ex parte orders, issued on November 15 and 22, 2010, the state conceded that those orders violated \u00a7 54-47aa. The first part of the court's inquiry focused, therefore, on whether the October 22, 2010 order, which authorized the disclosure of the defendant's historical cell phone records, violated \u00a7 54-47aa, a question that the court answered in the affirmative. The court then addressed the second issue-whether suppression was the appropriate remedy for evidence that the state had obtained in violation of \u00a7 54-47aa. The court acknowledged that suppression was not always required for evidence obtained in violation of state law. The court observed, however, that, because \u00a7 54-47aa implicates important fourth amendment privacy interests and because the failure to apply the exclusionary rule would encourage further violations, suppression was the appropriate remedy.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-22\">\n   Finally, the court considered the defendant's claim that, because the state had conceded that, in the absence of the illegally obtained CSLI, it would not have interviewed Johnson and obtained his statement implicating himself and the defendant on November 23, 2010, the court should suppress Johnson's statement and potential trial testimony. The court observed that there was ample evidence in the record to sustain the defendant's burden to prove that Johnson's arrest was tainted. The remaining question for the court was whether the state had proven that one of the exceptions to the exclusionary rule applied. The court began with the observation that, because Johnson did not testify at the suppression hearing, \"the record is utterly barren concerning the circumstances of [his] interrogation and [his] willingness or unwillingness to give his statements or to testify.\" Although the court credited the testimony and evidence presented by the state that supported a finding that the state eventually would have identified and located Johnson even without the CSLI, it noted that it was unclear whether Johnson would have confessed if he had not been confronted with the damning CSLI evidence. In light of that lacuna in the record, the court concluded that the state had failed to prove that it inevitably would have obtained the statement from Johnson incriminating himself and the defendant.\n   <footnotemark>\n    6\n   </footnotemark>\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-23\">\n   Following the granting of the defendant's motions to suppress, the state entered nolles prosequi on all of the charges against the defendant in the pending cases. In response, the defendant made an oral motion to dismiss\n   all charges, which the trial court granted. This appeal followed.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-24\">\n   We consider the question of whether the trial court properly granted the defendant's motions to suppress the CSLI records in two parts. First, we conclude that those records were obtained illegally. The state's concession that the prospective orders were issued in violation of \u00a7 54-47aa\n   resolves that question for the two prospective orders. As for the October 22, 2010 ex parte order authorizing the disclosure of approximately three months of the defendant's historical CSLI, we conclude that the order violated his fourth amendment rights. See\n   <em>\n    Carpenter\n   </em>\n   v.\n   <em>\n    United States\n   </em>\n   , supra,\n   <extracted-citation case-ids=\"12612910\" index=\"2\" url=\"https://cite.case.law/s-ct/138/2206/#p2217\">\n    138 S.Ct. at 2206\n   </extracted-citation>\n   . Second, we conclude that the trial court properly determined that suppression was the appropriate remedy as to all three sets of illegally obtained records. Finally, we conclude that the trial court properly determined that the suppression of those records also required that Johnson's statement and potential testimony be suppressed.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-25\">\n   I\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-26\">\n   We first consider whether the trial court properly concluded that the state obtained the defendant's CSLI illegally. Before proceeding to the substance, we set forth the applicable standard of review of a trial court's decision on a motion to suppress. \"A finding of fact will not be disturbed unless it is clearly erroneous in view of the evidence and pleadings in the whole record .... [W]hen a question of fact is essential to the outcome of a particular legal determination that implicates a defendant's constitutional rights, [however] and the credibility of witnesses is not the primary issue, our customary deference to the trial court's factual findings is tempered by a scrupulous examination of the record to ascertain that the trial court's factual findings are supported by substantial evidence.... [W]here the\n   legal conclusions of the court are challenged, [our review is plenary, and] we must determine whether they are legally and logically correct and whether they find support in the facts set out in the memorandum of decision ....\" (Internal quotation marks omitted.)\n   <em>\n    State\n   </em>\n   v.\n   <em>\n    Kendrick\n   </em>\n   ,\n   <extracted-citation index=\"3\" url=\"https://cite.case.law/citations/?q=314%20Conn.%20212\">\n    314 Conn. 212\n   </extracted-citation>\n   , 222,\n   <extracted-citation index=\"4\" url=\"https://cite.case.law/citations/?q=100%20A.3d%20821\">\n    100 A.3d 821\n   </extracted-citation>\n   (2014). Because the state's claim that the trial court improperly concluded that law enforcement obtained the CSLI illegally challenges the trial court's legal conclusions, we exercise plenary review. See\n   <extracted-citation index=\"5\" url=\"https://cite.case.law/citations/?q=100%20A.3d%20821\">\n    id.\n   </extracted-citation>\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-27\">\n   We begin, as did the trial court, with the state's concession of the illegality of the two prospective ex parte orders. Given that concession, we need only resolve the legality of the October 22, 2010 ex parte order, which authorized the disclosure of the defendant's historical CSLI. That question is resolved by the recent decision of the United States Supreme Court in\n   <em>\n    Carpenter\n   </em>\n   v.\n   <em>\n    United States\n   </em>\n   , supra,\n   <extracted-citation case-ids=\"12612910\" index=\"6\" url=\"https://cite.case.law/s-ct/138/2206/#p2217\">\n    138 S.Ct. at 2206\n   </extracted-citation>\n   . In\n   <em>\n    Carpenter\n   </em>\n   , the court considered whether the state \"conducts a search under the [f]ourth [a]mendment when it accesses historical cell phone records that provide a comprehensive chronicle of the user's past movements.\"\n   <extracted-citation case-ids=\"12612910\" index=\"7\" url=\"https://cite.case.law/s-ct/138/2206/#p2217\">\n    Id., at 2211\n   </extracted-citation>\n   . The court answered that question in the affirmative and held that \"an individual maintains a legitimate expectation of privacy in the record of his physical movements as captured through CSLI.\"\n   <extracted-citation case-ids=\"12612910\" index=\"8\" url=\"https://cite.case.law/s-ct/138/2206/#p2217\">\n    Id., at 2217\n   </extracted-citation>\n   . Accordingly, the state \"must generally obtain a warrant supported by probable cause before acquiring such records.\"\n   <extracted-citation case-ids=\"12612910\" index=\"9\" url=\"https://cite.case.law/s-ct/138/2206/#p2217\">\n    Id., at 2221\n   </extracted-citation>\n   .\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-28\">\n   It is undisputed that the state did not obtain a warrant supported by probable cause in order to procure the defendant's historical CSLI. Instead, the state relied on \u00a7 54-47aa (b) to obtain the ex parte order authorizing the disclosure of those records. At the time of the offenses, \u00a7 54-47aa (b) authorized a judge of the Superior Court to issue an ex parte order compelling a telecommunications carrier to disclose call identifying information and/or basic subscriber information pertaining\n   to a customer if the law enforcement official seeking the order swore under oath that there was a \"reasonable and articulable suspicion that a crime has been or is being committed or that exigent circumstances exist and such call-identifying or\n   basic subscriber information is relevant and material to an ongoing criminal investigation.\"\n   <footnotemark>\n    7\n   </footnotemark>\n   General Statutes (Rev. to 2009) \u00a7 54-47aa (b). Accordingly, because the record is clear that the state obtained the defendant's historical CSLI in the absence of a warrant supported by probable cause, the disclosure of those records violated the defendant's fourth amendment rights.\n   <footnotemark>\n    8\n   </footnotemark>\n   II\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-29\">\n   We next address the question of whether the trial court properly concluded that suppression of the historical and real time CSLI was the appropriate remedy. The issue presents a question of law over which we have plenary review. See, e.g.,\n   <em>\n    State\n   </em>\n   v.\n   <em>\n    Kendrick\n   </em>\n   , supra,\n   <extracted-citation index=\"10\" url=\"https://cite.case.law/citations/?q=314%20Conn.%20212\">\n    314 Conn. at 222\n   </extracted-citation>\n   ,\n   <extracted-citation index=\"11\" url=\"https://cite.case.law/citations/?q=100%20A.3d%20821\">\n    100 A.3d 821\n   </extracted-citation>\n   . Because the illegality of the historical CSLI is grounded on our conclusion that the seizure of those records violated the defendant's fourth amendment rights, we first consider whether those records properly were suppressed. The state contends that, because the officers acted in reasonable reliance on the court's ex parte\n   order, they acted in good faith and the purpose of the exclusionary rule-to deter police misconduct-does not apply. In response, the defendant relies on the greater protection provided under the state constitution for fourth amendment violations. That is, relying on this court's decision in\n   <em>\n    State\n   </em>\n   v.\n   <em>\n    Marsala\n   </em>\n   ,\n   <extracted-citation case-ids=\"520741\" index=\"12\" url=\"https://cite.case.law/conn/216/150/#p171\">\n    216 Conn. 150\n   </extracted-citation>\n   , 171,\n   <extracted-citation index=\"13\" url=\"https://cite.case.law/citations/?q=579%20A.2d%2058\">\n    579 A.2d 58\n   </extracted-citation>\n   (1990), the defendant responds that Connecticut has rejected the good faith exception to the application of the exclusionary rule.

Accordingly, because the\n   only exception on which the state relies is one that this court expressly and consistently has held is not recognized in Connecticut, the trial court properly suppressed the CSLI obtained pursuant to the October 22, 2010 ex parte order.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-32\">\n   As to the two prospective ex parte orders issued on November 10 and 22, 2010, once again we begin with the state's concession that those two orders were obtained in violation of \u00a7 54-47aa.\n   <footnotemark>\n    9\n   </footnotemark>\n   Notwithstanding that\n   concession, the state contends that, because \u00a7 54-47aa does not identify suppression as an available remedy for a violation of the statute, the trial court improperly granted the motion to suppress the CSLI obtained as a result of those two orders. The defendant responds that the trial court properly concluded that, because \u00a7 54-47aa implicates important fourth amendment interests, suppression of the CSLI obtained as a result of the two prospective orders is required. We conclude that, although the plain language of \u00a7 54-47aa is unclear as to whether suppression is available as a remedy for a violation of the statute, the legislative history provides strong, albeit not conclusive, support for the conclusion that the legislature intended the remedy to be available for violations. We find further support for interpreting \u00a7 54-47aa to provide for suppression as the appropriate remedy in the policy principles underlying the exclusionary rule itself. That is, we conclude that the real time tracking of the defendant's cell phone, in the absence of a showing of probable cause and in violation of \u00a7 54-47aa, implicated important fourth amendment interests, requiring the application of the exclusionary rule. We therefore conclude that the trial court properly determined that the violation of \u00a7 54-47aa required the suppression of the CSLI obtained from the two prospective ex parte orders.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-33\">\n   The question of whether \u00a7 54-47aa provides suppression as a remedy for a violation presents a question of\n   statutory interpretation, over which we exercise plenary review, guided by well established principles regarding legislative intent. See, e.g.,\n   <em>\n    Kasica\n   </em>\n   v.\n   <em>\n    Columbia\n   </em>\n   ,\n   <extracted-citation index=\"40\" url=\"https://cite.case.law/citations/?q=309%20Conn.%2085\">\n    309 Conn. 85\n   </extracted-citation>\n   , 93,\n   <extracted-citation index=\"41\" url=\"https://cite.case.law/citations/?q=70%20A.3d%201\">\n    70 A.3d 1\n   </extracted-citation>\n   (2013) (explaining plain meaning rule under General Statutes \u00a7 1-2z and setting forth process for ascertaining legislative intent). We turn first to the statutory text, which does not clarify whether the legislature intended to require or allow suppression for a violation of \u00a7 54-47aa. The statute neither expressly identifies nor precludes\n   <em>\n    any\n   </em>\n   remedies for violations of the statute. See footnote 3 of this opinion. By contrast, as the state points out, General Statutes \u00a7 54-41m expressly provides that a person aggrieved by a communication that was allegedly \"unlawfully intercepted\"\n   pursuant to chapter 959a, which governs wire-tapping and electronic surveillance, may file a motion to suppress.\n   <footnotemark>\n    10\n   </footnotemark>\n   The state contends that the provision of suppression as a remedy for a violation of the wiretapping statutes,\n   <footnotemark>\n    11\n   </footnotemark>\n   contrasted with the absence of a similar provision for a violation of \u00a7 54-47aa, supports its position\n   that suppression is not available as a remedy pursuant to \u00a7 54-47aa.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-34\">\n   We observe, however, that a comparison of \u00a7 54-47aa with the federal Stored Wire and Electronic Communications and Transactional Records Access Act (SCA), one of the statutory schemes on which \u00a7 54-47aa generally was modeled, yields a different contrast. Unlike \u00a7 54-47aa, the SCA lists the remedies available for a violation of that act. See\n   <extracted-citation index=\"42\" url=\"https://cite.case.law/citations/?q=18%20U.S.C.%20%C2%A7%202707\">\n    18 U.S.C. \u00a7 2707\n   </extracted-citation>\n   (b) (2012) (authorizing persons aggrieved by violations of SCA to bring civil action and listing \"appropriate relief,\" including equitable or declaratory relief, damages and attorney's fees). Suppression of illegally obtained evidence is not one of the listed remedies. Furthermore, the SCA includes an exclusivity of remedies provision: \"The remedies and sanctions described in this chapter are the only judicial remedies and sanctions for nonconstitutional violations of this chapter.\"\n   <extracted-citation index=\"43\" url=\"https://cite.case.law/citations/?q=18%20U.S.C.%20%C2%A7%202708\">\n    18 U.S.C. \u00a7 2708\n   </extracted-citation>\n   (2012). By contrast, as we have noted, \u00a7 54-47aa neither specifies available remedies nor limits them. The legislature easily could have incorporated the SCA's limited list of remedies into \u00a7 54-47aa, along with the SCA's exclusivity of remedies provision. The failure to do so supports the conclusion that the legislature did not intend to limit the remedies available for a violation of \u00a7 54-47aa.\n   <footnotemark>\n    12\n   </footnotemark>\n   At best, therefore, the plain language\n   of the\n   statute is ambiguous as to whether suppression is an available remedy.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-35\">\n   Because the plain language of the statute is ambiguous, we turn to the legislative history, which provides at least some support for the conclusion that the legislature intended that suppression would be available as a remedy for abuses of \u00a7 54-47aa. Section 54-47aa was first enacted through No. 05-182 of the 2005 Public Acts in order to address the difficulties encountered by law enforcement in gaining access to the basic subscriber information associated with a telephone number. Previously, that information had been readily obtained from local telephone companies. With the expansion of the telecommunications industry and the increasing prevalence of cell phones, however, law enforcement personnel increasingly found themselves dealing with out of state providers that were less cooperative in providing that basic information. See 48 S. Proc., Pt. 11, 2005 Sess. pp. 3435-36, remarks of Senator Andrew J. McDonald.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-36\">\n   One of the primary concerns in crafting the legislation was to strike the proper balance between the need for law enforcement to have access to such information and the need to safeguard the legitimate privacy interests of citizens. See 48 H.R. Proc., Pt. 26, 2005 Sess., pp. 7869, 7871, remarks of Representative Michael P. Lawlor. During the public hearing on the bill, Fanol Bojka, an attorney speaking on behalf of the Connecticut Criminal Defense Lawyers Association, spoke in opposition to the bill, expressing concern that the standard required in the proposed legislation was merely a reasonable suspicion rather than probable cause. Conn. Joint Standing Committee Hearings, Judiciary, Pt. 14, 2005 Sess., pp. 4122, 4124-25. In light of the lower standard and the absence of any express language specifying any recourse available to aggrieved parties, Bojka questioned: \"What is the remedy under this bill ... if\n   there are abuses?\"\n   <extracted-citation index=\"44\" url=\"https://cite.case.law/citations/?q=18%20U.S.C.%20%C2%A7%202708\">\n    Id., 4125\n   </extracted-citation>\n   . Representative Robert Farr responded immediately that suppression would be the appropriate remedy.\n   <extracted-citation index=\"45\" url=\"https://cite.case.law/citations/?q=18%20U.S.C.%20%C2%A7%202708\">\n    Id.\n   </extracted-citation>\n   Nothing in the legislative history counters that representation.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-37\">\n   Representative Farr's assertion that suppression is available as a remedy for a violation of \u00a7 54-47aa is consistent with the legal principles governing suppression. As the trial court correctly noted, the \"Connecticut Code of Evidence does not prescribe a specific rule governing the admissibility of evidence obtained under these circumstances. 'Where the code does not prescribe a rule governing the admissibility of evidence, the court shall be governed by the principles of common law as they may be interpreted in the light of reason and experience.' Conn. Code Evid. \u00a7 1-2 (b).\" Reason and experience counsel that the exclusionary rule requires the suppression of prospective CSLI obtained in violation of \u00a7 54-47aa. Although the United States Supreme Court has applied \"the exclusionary rule primarily to deter constitutional violations\";\n   <em>\n    Sanchez-Llamas\n   </em>\n   v.\n   <em>\n    Oregon\n   </em>\n   ,\n   <extracted-citation case-ids=\"3500432\" index=\"46\" url=\"https://cite.case.law/us/548/331/#p348\">\n    548 U.S. 331\n   </extracted-citation>\n   , 348,\n   <extracted-citation case-ids=\"3500432\" index=\"47\" url=\"https://cite.case.law/us/548/331/#p348\">\n    126 S.Ct. 2669\n   </extracted-citation>\n   ,\n   <extracted-citation case-ids=\"3500432\" index=\"48\" url=\"https://cite.case.law/us/548/331/#p348\">\n    165 L.Ed.2d 557\n   </extracted-citation>\n   (2006) ; it has identified narrow circumstances under which the rule properly applies to exclude evidence obtained in violation of statutory law. The circumstances under which the exclusionary rule may be applied to statutory violations, however, has been limited to those violations that implicate \"important [f]ourth [or] [f]ifth [a]mendment interests.\"\n   <extracted-citation case-ids=\"3500432\" index=\"49\" url=\"https://cite.case.law/us/548/331/#p348\">\n    Id.\n   </extracted-citation>\n   <footnotemark>\n    13\n   </footnotemark>\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-38\">\n   In the present case, the evidence obtained in violation of \u00a7 54-47aa-the prospective CSLI yielded from the real time tracking of the defendant's cell phone-implicates important privacy interests that are traditionally the type protected by the fourth amendment. In fact, as one court has observed, much of the rationale that the court relied on in\n   <em>\n    Carpenter\n   </em>\n   to hold that accessing historical CSLI implicates legitimate privacy interests applies with equal force to CSLI obtained by real time tracking, because the two types of records are not \"meaningfully different ....\"\n   <em>\n    Sims\n   </em>\n   v.\n   <em>\n    State\n   </em>\n   ,\n   <extracted-citation case-ids=\"12659152\" index=\"50\" url=\"https://cite.case.law/sw3d/569/634/\">\n    569 S.W.3d 634\n   </extracted-citation>\n   , 645 n.15,\n   <extracted-citation index=\"51\" url=\"https://cite.case.law/citations/?q=2019%20WL%20208631\">\n    2019 WL 208631\n   </extracted-citation>\n   , *7 n.15 (Tex. 2019).

The trial court found that the state had established that it would have identified and located Johnson. The court grounded its rejection of the state's reliance on the inevitable discovery doctrine, however, on the state's failure to prove that, if found by legal means and if questioned without the reliance on the illegally obtained CSLI, Johnson would have cooperated to the same extent. Johnson's cooperation was a contingency upon which the procurement of a statement incriminating himself and the defendant depended.

Because the state failed to present any evidence regarding the likelihood of Johnson's cooperation under different circumstances, the trial court properly reasoned that any conclusion regarding Johnson's cooperation would have rested on pure speculation.

The majority rejected that characterization, responding that \"we need not decide whether there is a limited period for which the [g]overnment may obtain an individual's historical CSLI free from [f]ourth [a]mendment scrutiny, and if so, how long that period might be. It is sufficient for our purposes ... to hold that accessing seven days of CSLI constitutes a [f]ourth amendment search.\"\n    <extracted-citation case-ids=\"12612910\" index=\"88\" url=\"https://cite.case.law/s-ct/138/2206/#p2217\">\n     Id.,\n    </extracted-citation>\n    at 2217 n.3. We believe that a fair reading of the decision is that accessing CSLI for seven days or more is clearly a search for purposes of the fourth amendment. What the court left unsettled is whether accessing CSLI for fewer than seven days constitutes a search. At best, therefore,\n    <em>\n     Carpenter\n    </em>\n    leaves unanswered the question of whether an order targeting a very short time frame would be permitted under the fourth amendment. More importantly for purposes of the present case, however, is that, even if the state were correct that\n    <em>\n     Carpenter\n    </em>\n    is limited to cases in which the state accesses more than six days of CSLI, the October 22, 2010 ex parte order falls well within that rule. As the state acknowledges, that order authorized the disclosure of sixty-two days of historical CSLI, from July 29 to September 29, 2010.\n   </p>\n   <p id=\"p-69\">\n    Finally, we observe that the state appears to suggest that, if it is correct that the holding in\n    <em>\n     Carpenter\n    </em>\n    is limited to instances in which the state has accessed seven days or more of historical CSLI, this court should remand to the trial court for a hearing to determine which six days of historical CSLI the state\n    <em>\n     would have sought\n    </em>\n    if they had been aware of the supposed six day limit. Even if we agreed with the state's reading of\n    <em>\n     Carpenter\n    </em>\n    , we would categorically reject that claim. We find the procedure requested by the state to be inappropriate in the present case, in which the state seeks the opportunity to return to the trial court so that it may belatedly attempt to \"correct\" the infringement with the benefit of having reviewed all the data for the critical pieces of evidence.\n   </p>\n  </footnote>\n  <footnote label=\"9\">\n   <p id=\"p-70\">\n    As we noted previously in this opinion, the state's concession that the two prospective orders violated \u00a7 54-47aa has rendered it unnecessary to resolve whether those orders also violate the fourth amendment. Moreover, it is at best unclear whether the holding in\n    <em>\n     Carpenter\n    </em>\n    would extend to the two prospective orders. Neither of the two orders authorized the release of more than three days of CSLI and both applied prospectively. Although we see no difficulty in extending the rationale of\n    <em>\n     Carpenter\n    </em>\n    as applied to historical CSLI to prospective orders, the court expressly declined to resolve whether its holding would extend to orders authorizing the disclosure of fewer than seven days of CSLI.\n    <em>\n     Carpenter\n    </em>\n    v.\n    <em>\n     United States\n    </em>\n    , supra,\n    <extracted-citation case-ids=\"12612910\" index=\"89\" url=\"https://cite.case.law/s-ct/138/2206/#p2217\">\n     138 S.Ct. at\n    </extracted-citation>\n    2217 n.3.

Accordingly, in light of the state's concession and the court's failure in\n    <em>\n     Carpenter\n    </em>\n    to provide a clear resolution of the constitutional question-at least as to the two prospective orders-we confine our analysis to considering whether application of the exclusionary rule is the proper remedy for a violation of \u00a7 54-47aa.\n   </p>\n  </footnote>\n  <footnote label=\"10\">\n   <p id=\"p-71\">\n    General Statutes \u00a7 54-41m provides: \"Any aggrieved person in any trial, hearing or proceeding in or before any court, department, officer, agency, regulatory body or other authority of the state of Connecticut, or of a political subdivision thereof, may move to suppress the contents of any intercepted wire communication, or evidence derived therefrom, on the grounds that the communication was unlawfully intercepted under the provisions of this chapter; the order of authorization or approval under which it was intercepted is insufficient on its face; or the interception was not made in conformity with the order of authorization or approval. Such motion shall be made before the trial, hearing or proceeding unless there was no opportunity to make such motion or the person was not aware of the grounds of the motion, in which case such motion may be made at any time during the course of such trial, hearing or proceeding. If the motion is granted, the contents of the intercepted wire communication, or evidence derived therefrom, shall be treated as having been obtained in violation of this chapter and shall not be received in evidence in any such trial, hearing or proceeding.

See General Statutes (Rev. to 2009) \u00a7 54-47aa (g) (6).\n   </p>\n   <p id=\"p-74\">\n    The state's suggestion, however, that a motion to vacate could serve as a remedy for an order granted in violation of \u00a7 54-47aa, cannot be reconciled with the nature of the order-it is ex parte. Notice of the order is only required to be provided to the subscriber forty-eight hours after the order is issued, and there are numerous bases upon which a law enforcement officer may request that notice not be given. See General Statutes (Rev. to 2009) \u00a7 54-47aa (d). Given the delayed notice available to a subscriber, a motion to vacate can hardly be considered an efficacious remedy.\n   </p>\n  </footnote>\n  <footnote label=\"13\">\n   <p id=\"p-75\">\n    We find unpersuasive the state's reliance on\n    <em>\n     Virginia\n    </em>\n    v.\n    <em>\n     Moore\n    </em>\n    ,\n    <extracted-citation case-ids=\"3674054\" index=\"92\" url=\"https://cite.case.law/us/553/164/\">\n     553 U.S. 164\n    </extracted-citation>\n    ,\n    <extracted-citation case-ids=\"3674054\" index=\"93\" url=\"https://cite.case.law/us/553/164/\">\n     128 S.Ct. 1598\n    </extracted-citation>\n    ,\n    <extracted-citation case-ids=\"3674054\" index=\"94\" url=\"https://cite.case.law/us/553/164/\">\n     170 L.Ed.2d 559\n    </extracted-citation>\n    (2008), for the proposition that this court cannot conclude that suppression is an appropriate remedy for a violation of a statute that implicates the same important interests that are protected by the fourth amendment. The state's argument relies on a misreading of\n    <em>\n     Moore\n    </em>\n    . That case involved the question of whether \"a police officer violates the [f]ourth [a]mendment by making an arrest based on probable cause but prohibited by state law.\"\n    <extracted-citation case-ids=\"3674054\" index=\"95\" url=\"https://cite.case.law/us/553/164/\">\n     Id., at 166\n    </extracted-citation>\n    ,\n    <extracted-citation case-ids=\"3674054\" index=\"96\" url=\"https://cite.case.law/us/553/164/\">\n     128 S.Ct. 1598\n    </extracted-citation>\n    .

Under applicable state law, however, the officers should have issued the defendant a summons instead of arresting him.\n    <extracted-citation case-ids=\"3674054\" index=\"99\" url=\"https://cite.case.law/us/553/164/\">\n     Id.\n    </extracted-citation>\n    In a search incident to the arrest, the officers discovered that the defendant had crack cocaine on his person.\n    <extracted-citation case-ids=\"3674054\" index=\"100\" url=\"https://cite.case.law/us/553/164/\">\n     Id.\n    </extracted-citation>\n    The defendant sought suppression of the crack cocaine on the basis that, because the arrest violated state statutory law, it automatically violated the defendant's fourth amendment rights, and, therefore, he was entitled to the protection of the exclusionary rule.\n    <extracted-citation case-ids=\"3674054\" index=\"101\" url=\"https://cite.case.law/us/553/164/\">\n     Id., at 167-68\n    </extracted-citation>\n    ,\n    <extracted-citation case-ids=\"3674054\" index=\"102\" url=\"https://cite.case.law/us/553/164/\">\n     128 S.Ct. 1598\n    </extracted-citation>\n    .

The court explained further that the problem is that \"the [f]ourth [a]mendment's meaning [does] not change with local law enforcement practices-even practices set by rule.

The defendant's argument is that the violation of \u00a7 54-47aa triggers the rule's protections because of the\n    <em>\n     important nature of the interests\n    </em>\n    implicated by the statute, interests that are also protected by the fourth amendment. Accordingly, the concerns expressed by the court in\n    <em>\n     Moore\n    </em>\n    do not apply in the present case, in which we hold only that suppression is required for a violation of \u00a7 54-47aa because the statute implicates important interests protected by the fourth amendment. It is the importance of the protected interests-not the force of the fourth amendment itself-that requires suppression in the present case. Our decision does not reduce the fourth amendment to a redundancy; it simply recognizes that the fourth amendment is not the only means by which those important interests are protected.\n   </p>\n  </footnote>\n  <footnote label=\"14\">\n   <p id=\"p-77\">\n    To the extent that the state's brief may be read to suggest that the good faith exception to the exclusionary rule applies in Connecticut when the basis for the rule's application is a statutory, rather than a constitutional violation, we reject that argument.
