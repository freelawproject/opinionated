Hill, Kenneth C. White, and Lisa M. Brannock petition this Court under \u00a7 593(f) of the Ethics in Government Act of 1978, as amended, 28 U.S.C. \u00a7\u00a7 591-599 (1994), for reimbursement of attorneys\u2019 fees incurred during, and as a result of, the inves<page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"435\">*435</page-number>tigation conducted by Independent Counsel Daniel S. Pearson. Although the investigation has been terminated by the Independent Counsel, it continues under the Department of Justice. We therefore deny the petitions at this time.</p>\n<p id=\"b459-5\">Background</p>\n<p id=\"b459-6\">On July 6, 1995, Daniel S. Pearson was appointed as Independent Counsel (\u201cIC\u201d) to investigate certain matters related to Secretary of Commerce<footnotemark>1</footnotemark> Ronald H. Brown\u2019s finances. The investigation was proceeding when, on April 3, 1996, the Secretary was killed in an airplane accident. IC Pearson subsequently determined that, in light of the Secretary\u2019s death, \u201cthe original reason for the appointment of an Independent Counsel ... no longer existed,\u201d Final Report of the Independent Counsel In re: Ronald H. Brown at 7 (submitted June 10, 1996) (hereinafter Final Report), and it would be \u201cin the public\u2019s best interest to transfer the investigation\u201d to the Department of Justice, <em>id. </em>at 1. The Department agreed to the transfer, which was completed by May 31, 1996. <em>Id. </em>On June 10, 1996, IC Pearson submitted his Final Report to this court. Thereafter, petitioners filed applications with this court, seeking reimbursement of attorneys\u2019 fees assertedly incurred in connection with the IC\u2019s investigation.</p>\n<p id=\"b459-7\">Analysis</p>\n<p id=\"b459-8\">28 U.S.C. \u00a7 593(f)(1) provides:</p>\n<blockquote id=\"b459-9\">Upon the request of an individual who is the subject of an investigation conducted by an independent counsel pursuant to this chapter, the division of the court may, if no indictment is brought against such individual pursuant to that investigation, award reimbursement for those reasonable attorneys\u2019 fees incurred by that individual during that investigation which would not have been incurred but for the requirements of this chapter.</blockquote>\n<p id=\"b459-10\">Our first consideration is the \u201cno indictment\u201d requirement of the statute. In <em>In re North (Gadd Fee Application), </em>842 F.2d 340, 341 (D.C.Cir. Spec. Div.1988) (per curiam), we held that a determination concerning this requirement could not be made before the end of the IC\u2019s investigation. Gadd applied for reimbursement of attorneys\u2019 fees even though the IC\u2019s investigation had not been completed. He asserted that the \u201cno indictment\u201d requirement was fulfilled because he had not been indicted and had been given transactional immunity. We disagreed, noting that the investigation was continuing and indictments could still be brought against him (for perjury or for criminal conduct not covered by the immunity grant). <em>Id. </em>at 341-42.</p>\n<p id=\"b459-13\">The same holds true in the present case. Petitioners argue that the \u201cno indictment\u201d requirement is satisfied because the independent counsel did not bring any indictments against them. It is true that no indictments were brought against petitioners by the IC.<footnotemark>2</footnotemark> However, as in <em>Gadd, </em>the investigation remains active and ongoing, and indictments may yet be issued, albeit by the Department of Justice. <em>See </em>Department of Justice\u2019s Evaluation of Nolanda S. Hill\u2019s Application for Attorney\u2019s Fees at 3, In re: Ronald H. Brown (Mar. 3,1997) (Div. No. 95-2). .</p>\n<p id=\"b459-14\">We agree with the Department that \u201cawarding fees and expenses incurred in connection with an investigation that ultimately leads to the indictment (and possible conviction) of the petitioning subject\u201d would be an absurd result, inconsistent with the apparent intent of Congress. <em>Id. </em>at 5. Support for this position comes from the Senate Report that accompanied the initial enactment of the attorneys\u2019 fees provision; the Report states that the provision is intended for persons who incur the fees \u201cduring [an independent counsel\u2019s] investigation <em>which eventually absolves them of any wrongdoing.\u201d </em>S.Rep. No. 97-496, at 19 (1982), <em>reprinted in </em>1982 U.S.C.C.A.N. 3537, 3555 (emphasis added). Absolution in the form of non-indictment must come, not from an unforeseen event precipitating transfer of the investigation to <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"436\">*436</page-number>the Department of Justice, but rather from determinations made concerning the petitioners\u2019 substantive conduct. Any such determinations will now have to await the completion of the investigation by the Department of Justice.</p>\n<p id=\"b460-3\">Additionally, beyond non-indictment, \u00a7 593(f)(1) requires the applicant to establish that 1) she was the subject of an investigation; 2) the attorneys\u2019 fees sought for reimbursement were incurred during that investigation; 3) the fees would not have been incurred but for the existence of the Act; and 4) the fees are reasonable. <em>In re Mullins (Tamposi Fee Application), </em>84 F.3d 1439, 1441 (D.C.Cir. Spec. Div.1996) (per curiam). In <em>In re Pierce (Olivas Fee Application), </em>102 F.3d 1264, 1265 (D.C.Cir. Spec. Div.1996) (per curiam), we noted that making determinations concerning these requirements would be difficult without a \u201cfull account\u201d of the investigation from the IC\u2019s final report. Although IC Pearson filed his Final Report, it is far from being a \u201cfull account.\u201d Indeed, the Report specifically states that \u201cany recounting of the evidence relating to Secretary Brown or anyone else at this juncture could compromise th[e] continuing investigation and potential future prosecutions.\u201d Final Report at 2. Consequently, we hold that these additional requirements cannot be properly considered until the Department of Justice has finished its investigation and all the evidence is in.</p>\n<p id=\"b460-4\">IC Request for Relief</p>\n<p id=\"b460-5\">IC Pearson has requested that we issue an order relieving him of all further obligations related to his appointment. Under \u00a7 593(f)(2), the IC has an obligation to evaluate any attorneys\u2019 fees applications submitted to this court. Athough he has filed his remarks regarding the petitioners\u2019 present fee applications, it is possible that one or more of the petitioners (and perhaps others) will submit, at the conclusion of the Department of Justice\u2019s investigation, applications containing new information upon which the IC will then have to comment. Therefore, we cannot presently issue the order he requests.</p>\n<p id=\"b460-6\">Conclusion</p>\n<p id=\"b460-7\">For the reasons stated above, we conclude that petitioners\u2019 requests for attorneys\u2019 fees are premature; the applications are therefore denied without prejudice to renewal after the completion of the investigation by the Department of Justice. The Independent Counsel\u2019s request for relief from further obligations is also denied.</p>\n<footnote label=\"1\">\n<p id=\"b459-11\">.
