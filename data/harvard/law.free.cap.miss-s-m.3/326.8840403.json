Steen, sheriff of Rankin county, and John Lawrence, Elias Steen, John ,W. Webb, and Hardy Dear, Sen\u2019r., his sureties, at the June term, 1842, of the Circuit Court.of Rankin county,- for failing to make due return of a writ of <em>fieri fiadas </em>placed in <em>the hands of said </em>sheriff. Upon the trial of the motion, the plaintiff proved, that a writ of <em>fieri </em>facias', in their favor, against Thomas J. Coffee, William H. Washington, Henry K. Moss, and William H. Shelton, for $8870.60, with interest and costs, was placed in the hands of said sheriff, commanding him, &amp;c. ; which 'writ was returnable to the December term, 1841, of said Court; they, the sheriff\u2019s bond, proved service of notice of the motion, and that the writ of <em>fieri facias </em>was returned one day after the middle of the return term, to wit, on the 29th day of December, 1841. The defendants then read the following indorsement, made on said writ by the sheriff: \u201c There is no property in my county, so that I can make the money, or any part thereof; \u201d and proved that the indorsement was on the writ when it was 'returned into the clerk\u2019s office ; they also proved that when said writ issued, neither of the defendants named therein had any property out of which the money, or any part of it, could be made, and that they have had none since. This' being all the evidence adduced on either side, the Court rendered <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"327\">*327</page-number>judgment against the sheriff and his sureties, for the $8870.60, mentioned in said writ, with interest, damages and costs. The defendants filed their bill of exceptions, and now bring the case to this Court by writ of error.</summary>\n<attorneys data-order=\"5\" data-type=\"attorneys\" id=\"b323-4\">Hughes, for plaintiffs in error.</attorneys>\n<summary data-order=\"6\" data-type=\"legal\" id=\"b323-5\">1st.

By the Act of 1838, edition of Laws of 1838, page 892, the sheriff is given until the middle of the term to make his return. There <em>were two </em>weeks to the term. The middle of the term was Sunday, and the execution was deposited on Monday in the office, with the return of <em>nulla bona. </em>Leigh\u2019s Reports.</summary>\n<opinion data-order=\"8\" data-type=\"opinion\" id=\"x999-1\" type=\"majority\">\n<author id=\"b323-7\">Mr. Justice Thacher</author>\n<p id=\"AQF\">delivered the opinion of the Court.</p>\n<p id=\"b323-8\">This case is brought here by writ of error from the Circuit Court of Rankin county.</p>\n<p id=\"b323-9\">The defendants in error entered their motion in the Court below against Steen, the sheriff, for failing to return an execution in due time. The execution was issued at the June term, 1841, and returned upon the seventh judicial day of the succeeding December term of the Court of, Rankin county. The motion was made at the June term, 1842, and a judgment given in favor of the motion.</p>\n<p id=\"b323-10\">The judgment of the Court below is claimed to be erroneous ; lsf, because the motion was made too late, having been made at a term subsequent to that of the \u25a0 return of the execution ; and 2d, because the execution was returned seasonably.</p>\n<p id=\"b323-11\">The law regulating the return of executions was enacted February 15, 1828, by which it was provided, that if any sheriff should fail to return any execution to him directed on the return day thereof, the plaintiff in the execution may recover judgment against such sheriff and his sureties, for the amount of such execution, &amp;c., by motion before the Court to which such execution is returnable ; and by the act of February 16, 1838, the sheriff of the connty of Rankin had \u201c until the middle of each term of the Circuit Court of said county, <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"328\">*328</page-number>to make a return of all executions returnable to said Court; \u201d and by the act of February 2d, 1838, the- Circuit Court of Rankin county was permitted to continue twelve judicial days, and no longer.</p>\n<p id=\"b324-4\">By the phrase in the statute, \u201c the Court to which such execution is returnable,\u201d it does not seem that the legislature designed to restrict such matters against the sheriff to the term at which the execution, upon which such motion is founded, is returnable. The language of the act does not require such an interpretation. Sucfi motions may be made at a subsequent term. But was the execution returned seasonably in accordance with law ? The law gives the sheriff until the middle of the term to make such returns, which, we conceive, means to the middle of the term, and up to that event. The sheriff, in this case, had to the expiration of the sixth day of the term to make his return, and the return upon the seventh day was too late, and subjected him to the penalties of the statute in such case provided.</p>\n<p id=\"b324-5\">The judgment of the Court below is therefore affirmed.</p>\n</opinion>\n</casebody>\n",
