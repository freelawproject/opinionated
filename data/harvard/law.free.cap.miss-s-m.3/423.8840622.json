See How. &amp; Hutch. 540, sec. 47. This limitation of three years is interposed by the act of 1830, which gives the writ of error as a writ of right, upon filing in the office of the clerk of the Supreme Court a transcript of the record. In such case, the clerk of the Supreme Court was directed to issue the writ.</summary>\n<summary data-order=\"13\" data-type=\"legal\" id=\"A6A\">By the act of 13th May, 1837, however, the limitation of three years is repealed by implication, and the law entirely changed ; or, in other words, an entirely new law is enacted on the subject, directing the clerk of the Circuit Court to issue the writ, as a writ of right, in all coming time, without limitation. The language of the statute is, that, \u201chereafter, when any party, plaintiff or defendant, to.any judgment or decree, rendered in any Court in this State, shall desire to have such judgment or decree revised by the High Court of Errors and Appeals,\u2019 he, she or they, may apply by petition to the clerk\u201d of the Circuit Court, who is directed to issue the writ, without limitation. How. &amp; Hutch. 540, sec. 50.</summary>\n<summary data-order=\"14\" data-type=\"legal\" id=\"b420-7\">The judgment of the Court, against a party not in Court, is a judgment without jurisdiction ; and, if a Court render a judgment when it has not jurisdiction of the parties, the judgment is void, and it cannot be made good by the lapse of time, or the statute of limitation.</summary>\n<opinion data-order=\"15\" data-type=\"opinion\" id=\"x999-1\" type=\"majority\">\n<author id=\"b420-8\">Per Curiam.</author>\n<p id=\"ALh\">The only question presented in this cause, is, whether a writ of error, issued by the clerk of the Circuit Court, under the act of 1837, is subject to the statute of limitations of three .years. We see no reason to doubt that it is. Plow. &amp; Hutch. 540, sec. 47. In this case, the writ of error not having been sued out within three years of the rendition of the judgment in the Circuit Court, it must, for that reason, be dismissed. &lt;</p>\n</opinion>\n</casebody>\n",
