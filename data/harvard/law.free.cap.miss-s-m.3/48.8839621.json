Payne, and Peter Little, as the maker and indorsers of a promissory note. The declaration was in the usual form. The defendant, Little, pleaded the general issue ; and the other defendants also pleaded the general issue, and three pleas of payment. The first, averring payment to the plaintiffs ; the second, to William Fauver, while the note was <em>bona fide </em>his property; and the third, to Fauver &amp; Farnsworth.

Any other construction would defeat the intention of the statute, which was enacted evidently to protect parties from imposition by assignment of notes, &amp;c.</summary>\n<summary data-order=\"20\" data-type=\"legal\" id=\"b46-10\">We have been able, after a tolerably laborious search, to find but one authority against us on the point in controversy ; and that is the case of <em>Mandeville </em>v. <em>Union , Bank of Georgetown, </em>9 .Crancb, R. 1. Mandeville made his note in favor of Nourse, <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"51\">*51</page-number>negotiable at the Union Bank, Georgetown, dated 15th January, 1811, payable sixty days after date. The bank discounted the note on the same day for the use of Nourse.</summary>\n<summary data-order=\"21\" data-type=\"legal\" id=\"b47-4\">On the 30th January, Mandeville was informed of the discount of the note, made no objections, and said he had funds to meet it.</summary>\n<summary data-order=\"22\" data-type=\"legal\" id=\"b47-5\">On the day after the date of the note, Nourse gave Mandeville his note for $400 at sixty days. And on the 30th of the same month, became further indebted to Mandeville.</summary>\n<summary data-order=\"23\" data-type=\"legal\" id=\"b47-6\">On the 2d of February, Mandeville gave notice not to take the assignment of any notes made by him in favor of Nourse.</summary>\n<summary data-order=\"24\" data-type=\"legal\" id=\"b47-7\">Marshall, C. J. said, by making the note negotiable in .bank, the maker authorized the bank to advance on his credit, to the owner of the note, the sum expressed on its face,.</summary>\n<summary data-order=\"25\" data-type=\"legal\" id=\"b47-8\">It would-be a fraud on the bank to set up offsets against this note, in consequence of any transactions between the parties. These offsets are waived, and cannot, after the note is discounted, be again set up.</summary>\n<summary data-order=\"26\" data-type=\"legal\" id=\"b47-9\">The note was subject to the law of Virginia, which is the sam.e as ours.</summary>\n<summary data-order=\"27\" data-type=\"legal\" id=\"b47-10\">That case does not resemble the case now before the Court in any important feature. The note in this case was not such as are usually discounted by banks, it having several years to run to maturity. It was not offered for discount at the bank until long after its date ; and neither the maker, nor his accommodation-indorsers, ever assented to the discount of it by the bank ; and the defence set up existed at the time the note was discounted by the bank. All of which facts are contrary in Mandeville\u2019s case.</summary>\n<summary data-order=\"28\" data-type=\"legal\" id=\"b47-11\">Besides, Mandeville\u2019s case was decided without argument, to any extent, without authority, and without any analytical examination of the statute. It seems to have been decided, in fact, upon what appeared to be the intention of the parties ; and from all the circumstances, may be a very correct view of the law, except that the Chief Justice gives more weight to- the circumstance, that the note was negotiable at the bank, than it would seem to deserve. If making a note negotiable at a particular place, will authorize the assignment of it at that place, so as to defeat all defences existing at the time, it would appear but reasonable, that making a note negptia-. <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"52\">*52</page-number>ble, generally, would enable the holder to assign it when he pleased, and thereby defeat the defence which might exist; and as all notes are negotiable by assignment, it would follow, that a. new assignment would deprive the maker of his defence ; which is in direct conflict with the statute, and is therefore absurd.</summary>\n<summary data-order=\"29\" data-type=\"legal\" id=\"b48-4\">This question has never fully engaged the attention of our courts of last resort, although the point was made in the case, <em>Parham, et al. </em>v. <em>Randolph, et al. </em>4 How. R. 453, in which no, opinion is given.</summary>\n<summary data-order=\"30\" data-type=\"legal\" id=\"b48-5\">It would be difficult, indeed, to conceive of any reason why a bank should be exempt from the general rule. When it is understood, from all the circumstances of the case, that the parties, at the time of making \u00e1 note, had it in contemplation to get it discounted at a bank, and it was in fact afterwards discounted at the bank, it would be equitably construed to be a contract direct with the bank, and no defence should be admitted on account of dealings between the parties. The transactions between the maker and indorsers should be regarded as inducements to become mutually bound to the bank ; but when it is plain the bank was selected as the place of negotiability of the note, without any view of transferring the note at the time, no such reason exists for so liberal a construction in favor of the bank.</summary>\n<summary data-order=\"31\" data-type=\"legal\" id=\"b48-6\">The special verdict fully shows, that the note was liquidated and satisfied before it was assigned to the bank, and was in fact assigned to the bank by a person having no right whatever to use it, and in fraud of the maker and the proper holder. For which reasons we think the judgment should be reversed.</summary>\n<attorneys data-order=\"32\" data-type=\"attorneys\" id=\"b48-7\"><em>Eustis, </em>for appellees.</attorneys>\n<summary data-order=\"33\" data-type=\"legal\" id=\"b48-8\">The English rule is, that a party taking a negotiable instrument <em>before it' is due, </em>receives it on its own intrinsic credit; nor is he bound to inquire into any circumstances existing between the assignor and any of the previous parties to the bill, as he will not be affected by them, unless, indeed, the circumstances under which the transferee takes the bill be such as would naturally have excited the suspicion of a prudent and careful man.

How. &amp; Hutch, p. 373, s. <em>12.</em></summary>\n<summary data-order=\"37\" data-type=\"legal\" id=\"b49-6\">To this we reply \u2014</summary>\n<summary data-order=\"38\" data-type=\"legal\" id=\"b49-7\">I. The record shows that, at the time of the settlement, Fauver &amp; Farnsworth could not produce the note ; that the maker was apprized that he was incurring a risk in making the settlement ; and that he required and received an indemnity against that risk. He proceeded to make the settlement after his suspicions were aroused, and therein, if he was not acting <em>mala fide, </em>he was at all events not vigilant, and therefore is not within the statute as against an innocent third party. The statute must not be so construed as to authorize the commission of frauds, or the omission of common care and prudence. Here the party omitted to insist upon, the production of the note. This was gross negligence ; and if he has acted innocently, the present holder of the note is equally innocent.</summary>\n<summary data-order=\"39\" data-type=\"legal\" id=\"b49-8\">It may be laid down as a general principle, that, whenever one- of two innocent persons must suffer by the act of a third, he, who has enabled such third person to occasion the loss, must sustain it. <em>Lickbarroio </em>v. Mason, <em>2 </em>Term R. 70.</summary>\n<summary data-order=\"40\" data-type=\"legal\" id=\"b49-9\">II. It has been established by repeated decisions, that a demand of payment, without producing the note, is not a sufficient demand of payment of that note to bind an indorser. By analogy, paying when the note is not produced, is not paying the note ; it is in fact only puting the payee in funds, and. relying upon him that he will pay the note. It is not a <em>payment </em>of the note, which is now in the hands of an innocent holder, without notice. And if it be urged <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"54\">*54</page-number>as a set-off, we say that there is another fund out of which the amount of the set-off should be made, viz., the bond of indemnity. Set-off, having its origin in equity, must not be applied so as to operate inequitably. A. having two funds, B. having but one of them, A. must be confined to one, so as to leave the other for the benefit of B. 1 Story, Eq. 528, and cases cited ; <em>Ratlelagh </em>v. Hayes, 1 Verm. 90.</summary>\n<summary data-order=\"41\" data-type=\"legal\" id=\"b50-4\">III. The form of the note is a waiver in writing of the benefit of the statute of set-off. Making a note negotiable in a bank, is issuing a letter of credit to that bank to advance money in the note. Here the note was negotiable and payable in the Agricultural Bank. They discounted it, <em>before it was due.' </em>The record shows no publication by the parties against the note ; .no circumstance of any kind to arouse a suspicion, or anywise rebutting the authority given in the note, to the bank, to discount it. <em>Mandeville </em>v. <em>Union Bank of </em>Georgetown, 9 Cranch, 1 ; <em>McMurran </em>v. <em>Soria, </em>4 How. R. <em>154; Parham </em>v. <em>Randolph, 4 </em>How. R..435. For the Virginia statute, see Tait\u2019s Digest,'173.</summary>\n<summary data-order=\"42\" data-type=\"legal\" id=\"b50-5\">IV. We deny the fact that Fauver &amp; Farnsworth had the note at the time of \u201c liquidation.\u201d The non-production of it at that time raises a presumption to the contrary. How is this <em>presumption </em>rebutted ? by showing that after the death of one of the partners, it was in the possession of his widow. This is long after the liquidation in point of time ; and even if it proved that Fauver bad the note at the time of his death (whichitdoes not), it by no means proves that Fauver &amp; Farnsworth had the note in possession at the time of \u201cliquidation.\u201d In fact, by the rule that possession of a note is <em>prima facie </em>evidence of title to it, the note was the private property of Mrs. Fauver on the very day when the settlement was made by the maker with Fauver &amp; Farnsworth.</summary>\n<summary data-order=\"43\" data-type=\"legal\" id=\"b50-6\">V. The fraudulent assignment by Besangon does not affect this action. <em>Robertson </em>v. <em>Williams, 5 </em>Munf. 381 ; <em>McNeil </em>v. <em>Baird, </em>6 Munf. 316 ; <em>Holy </em>v. <em>Lane, </em>2 Atk. 181 ; 1 Russ. 412.</summary>\n<attorneys data-order=\"44\" data-type=\"attorneys\" id=\"b50-7\"><em>Quitman </em>and <em>McMurran, </em>on the same side.</attorneys>\n<summary data-order=\"45\" data-type=\"legal\" id=\"b50-8\">The decision of the\u2018 Court below is founded on an agreed case. The suit was founded on a promissory note, and the Court on the <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"55\">*55</page-number>facts gave judgment in favor of the plaintiffs below for the amount of the claim. The defendants have prosecuted their writ of error for the purpose of reversing the judgment. We insist that it shall be affirm'ed.</summary>\n<summary data-order=\"46\" data-type=\"legal\" id=\"b51-4\">1st. Because the note sued on is payable and negotiable at the Agricultural Bank of Mississippi ; and that bank having discounted it in good faith, and become the holders of iffor a valuable.consideration, they cannot be defeated in a recovery. Failure of consideration, or payment before the maturity of the note, to a third person, who may have once been the holder of it, cannot interfere with the right of the bank. This point has been so decided by the Supreme Court of the United States, in the case of <em>Mandeville </em>v. <em>The Union Bank of </em>Georgetown, 9 Cranch, 1, and was fully recognized by this Court in the case of <em>McMurran </em>v. Soria, <em>et </em>al., 4 Howard\u2019s Rep. 154.</summary>\n<summary data-order=\"47\" data-type=\"legal\" id=\"b51-5\">Besides, the very fact of Fauver &amp; Farnsworth giving an agree-' ment and indemnity to Allein against the note sued on, when they made the alleged arrangement with him, shows that they did not then hold or control the note, or it would have been delivered up to Allein. It bad then passed out of the hands of Fauver &amp; Farns-worth, and never returned ; and a payment, under the circumstances, by Allein to Fauver &amp; Farnsworth, .was no payment of the note ; and the taking of the agreement and indemnity to Allein, at the time, from them, shows that he so understood it.</summary>\n<summary data-order=\"48\" data-type=\"legal\" id=\"b51-6\">And this brings us to the second leading point upon which we rely. Allein has furnished himself with an indemnity, taken from Fauver &amp; Farnsworth, against the payment of the note sued on, to the Agricultural Bank or any other owner of it. And with this indemnity, exhibited by himself, will he be allowed to resist the payment of this note to the bank, notwithstanding the indemnity ? Shall the bank lose her recourse against him and his indorsers on the note sued on, and thereby be deprived of their claim <em>? </em>for they, or Peter Little, who \u2022 had the note discounted, must lose the debt, unless a recovery can be had in this case against Allein and his indorsers. And shall he and his indorsers be discharged in this action, when the indemnity was taken with reference -to such a 'recovery ? Our statute allowing offsets, failure of consideration, &amp;c., to be pleaded against the <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"56\">*56</page-number>indorsee of a note, previous to the maker\u2019s notice of the transfer to the indorsee, cannot avail in this case upon the facts.</summary>\n<summary data-order=\"49\" data-type=\"legal\" id=\"b52-4\">In this case, the maker of the note entered into a settlement of it <em>before it loas </em>due, and when the persons with whom the settlement was made had not the note, or it would have been delivered up. Besides, he took an indemnity, and upon that he must rely ; it was an implied waiver of any offset of this kind to the note in' the hands of a third person. The plaintiffs being the <em>bona fide </em>holders of the note, the Court will not allow the defence set up in the Court below to avail against them, when Allein and his indorsers have Fauver &amp; Farns-worth\u2019s guarranty to protect them against this very judgment, which they are now seeking to reverse. 1 Vern. 190 ; 2 Atk. R. 181.</summary>\n<summary data-order=\"50\" data-type=\"legal\" id=\"b52-5\">As to the point that Besanqon, through Dumax, may have got the note improperly from, Mrs. Fauver, the holder of it, after Fauver &amp; Farnsworth got it from Allein, these defendants, or plaintiffs in error, cannot avail themselves, as it was received by Little, the last indorser, and discounted by the bank in good faith, <em>before its maturity. </em>Chitty on Bills, 190, 191-; 7 Term R. 427 <em>; 4 </em>Taunt. 114 ; Dougl. 611, 633 ; 1 Burr. 452 ; 4 Esp. 56.</summary>\n<summary data-order=\"51\" data-type=\"legal\" id=\"b52-6\">And our statute as to offsets, <em>failure of consideration, </em>&amp;c., between the maker and remote indorser, does not touch or affect the position just taken and supported by authority.</summary>\n<opinion data-order=\"52\" data-type=\"opinion\" id=\"x999-1\" type=\"majority\">\n<author id=\"b52-7\">Mr. Justice Thacher</author>\n<p id=\"AO\">delivered the opinion of the Court.</p>\n<p id=\"b52-8\">This was an appeal from the judgment of the .Circuit Court of Jefferson county, upon an agreed special verdict. On the 9th day of April, 1836, Thomas Allein made his promissory note, negotiable and payable at the Agricultural Bank of Mississippi, four years aft\u00e9r its date, which was, on the day of its date, indorsed by James Wood and James Payne, for the accommodation of the maker, and by him passed to Fauver &amp; Farnsworth. On the 2d day of January, 1838,-Fauver &amp; Farnsworth gave Allein an obligation, with a full penalty, to deliver up the note now in suit, acknowledging therein that the said note had been liquidated by him. Fauver deceased some time in the summer or fall of 1838, after which event the note was in the possession of his widow, indorsed by Wood and Payne, and was taken out of her possession <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"57\">*57</page-number>without her consent. Subsequently, and before its maturity, the note was indorsed by Peter Little, and was discounted to his credit by the Agricultural Bank, on the 25th day of February, 1839. The note was regularly protested for non-payment, and due notice given to all the indorsers. Upon a finding of facts, of which the foregoing is an abstract, the Court below rendered a judgment for the Agricultural Bank, against all the parties to the note.</p>\n<p id=\"b53-4\">The appellants rely upon the statute regulating the assignment of promissory notes, &amp;c., How. &amp; Hutch. 373, s. 12, as affording them the benefit in this action^of the liquidation of the note, by the maker, with Fauver &amp; Farnsworth. This payment was complete, although the note was not surrendered up at that time. A demand of payment, without a presentation of the note, is an insufficient demand ; but a payment of a note, without its delivery, but also in the absence of notice to its maker, of its assignment, is good, and is protected by the very operation of this statute. It does not appear that the note had been assigned at the time of the arrangement with Fauver &amp; Farnsworth. The fact of its nondelivery, at that time, might possibly raise such a presumption ; but in a defence of the kind under consideration, the proof of notice to the maker of the assignment, is a matter requiring a higher degree of evidence than that of presumption. The obligation of the indemnity extended merely to a future delivery of the note. The fact of taking the indemnity, might be considered as a presumptive notice of assignment, but still of no higher grade of evidence than that which arises from the non-delivery of the note, and so far as it was intended as a protection against payment in the hands of other holders, was entirely unnecessary; because such payment could not be enforced by them, by the terms of the statute, without proof of notice of the assignment to them.</p>\n<p id=\"b53-5\">The statute in question allows the defendant in all actions upon such instruments, whether negotiable or not, the benefit of all want of lawful consideration, failure of consideration, payments, discounts, and set-offs, made, had, or possessed against the same, previous to notice of assignment. This has the effect to change the rule in many particulars, as established by the Law Merchant. The assignee takes the note, subject to all the objections and in-<page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"58\">*58</page-number>cumbrances that may appertain to it, of the kind described in the statute, up to the time of the notice of assignment.</p>\n<p id=\"b54-4\">The appellees rely chiefly upon the opinion of C. J. Marshall,, in the case of <em>Mandeville </em>v. <em>The Union Bank of Georgetown, </em>9 Cranch, 1. It is there laid down, that by making a note negotiable in bank, the maker authorizes the bank to advance on his credit, to the owner of the note, the sum expressed on its face ; that it would be a fraud on the bank to set up offsets against this note, in consequence of any transactions between the parties, and that such offsets are waived, and cannot, after the. note has been discounted, be again set up. But, passing over the points of difference in the facts which seem to exist between that case and the one now under examination, the principle there established, although made in view of a statute similar to our own, appears to us totally irreconcilable with the spirit and object of the statute. And while the opinion expressed by this Court in the case of <em>McMurran </em>v. <em>Soria, et al., </em>4 H. 154, does not amount to a recognition of that decision, it has already been seriously questioned in <em>Parham, et al. v. Randolph, et al., </em>4 H. 435. The authority turns exclusively upon the position, that the maker of a note, by making it negotiable in bank, authorizes the bank to advance its amount upon his credit. Such is by ho means the custom in this State, where notes are made thus negotiable and payable, simply as a convenience to the maker in paying, and to the holder in receiving payment. <em>On the </em>other hand, the statute is express and without exception. There is no statutory exception to set-offs, existing under such circumstances, and the introduction of such exceptions by the courts, might entirely defeat the intent of the statute. _</p>\n<p id=\"b54-5\">Though the facts of this case, by virtue of this statute, afford a sufficient defence to Ailein, Wood, and Payne, they do not avail the indorser, Little. He did not become an indorser until subsequent to the arrangement made by Ailein with Fauver &amp; Farns-worth ;' but as between him and the Agricultural Bank, the contract was new and separate, nor does anything appear which can prevent <em>k </em>recovery from him by the Agricultural Bank. Under the act of May, 1837, regulating actions founded upon bills of exchange and promissory notes, it is lawful to render a verdict against part of the defendants, when the evidence requires such a verdict.</p>\n<p id=\"b55-4\"><page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"59\">*59</page-number>The judgment, therefore, of the Court below, is reversed as to the defendants, Allein, Wood, and Payne, but affirmed as to the defendant Little ; and this Court, proceeding to pronounce the judgment which the Court below should have given, directs that a judgment be entered up in favor of the said defendants, Allein, Wood, and Payne.</p>\n</opinion>\n</casebody>\n",
