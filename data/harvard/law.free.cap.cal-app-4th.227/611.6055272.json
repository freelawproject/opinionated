The trial court concluded it had committed instructional error, and granted Iraheta\u2019s motion. Plaintiff and appellant the People of the State of California appeal the trial court\u2019s ruling. In the published portion of this opinion, we agree with the People that the court properly declined to instruct on imperfect self-defense on the charge of shooting at an occupied motor vehicle, and therefore its ruling granting a new trial was an abuse of discretion. In the unpublished portion, we conclude that the other grounds raised in the new trial motion do not support the trial court\u2019s ruling. Accordingly, we reverse the trial court\u2019s order and remand for further proceedings.</p>\n<p id=\"b562-3\"><page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"614\">*614</page-number>FACTUAL AND PROCEDURAL BACKGROUND</p>\n<p id=\"As9G\">1. <em>Facts</em></p>\n<p id=\"b562-4\">A. <em>People\u2019s evidence</em></p>\n<p id=\"b562-5\">Viewed in accordance with the usual rules governing appellate review, the evidence relevant to the issues raised on appeal established the following.<footnotemark>2</footnotemark></p>\n<p id=\"b562-6\">(1) <em>The December 2002 shooting of Michael Orozco</em></p>\n<p id=\"b562-7\">On December 20, 2002, at approximately 5:30 p.m., Noe Martinez drove his white Honda Civic to the Jr. Market in Inglewood. Inside the market, Jose Tovar, whom Martinez did not know, kept staring at him, giving him a bad feeling. When Martinez left the market, Tovar walked toward Martinez\u2019s Honda, and pulled out a cellular telephone when a police car pulled up. Tovar was a member of the Inglewood 13 criminal street gang.</p>\n<p id=\"b562-8\">Martinez drove to his friend Michael Orozco\u2019s home, where he socialized and drank beer. At approximately 8:30 that evening, Orozco and Martinez headed for another friend\u2019s home. Because Martinez was feeling \u201cbuzzed,\u201d Orozco drove Martinez\u2019s Honda. Their route took them past the Jr. Market.</p>\n<p id=\"b562-9\">Meanwhile, Iraheta drove his girlfriend Melody Maciel, his younger brother Richard Iraheta,<footnotemark>3</footnotemark> and his stepbrother Alexis Moreno to the Jr. Market in his Camaro. Once there, he stopped to talk to his friend, Tovar. Martinez\u2019s car passed by the market, and Tovar pointed at it. Martinez saw Tovar\u2019s gesture, and told Orozco to \u201cstep on it.\u201d</p>\n<p id=\"b562-10\">When Martinez and Orozco drove away, Iraheta followed them in his Camaro. Orozco drove to 65th Street and, at Martinez\u2019s direction, stopped the car. Martinez exited the Honda to talk to the people in the Camaro. He was wearing a red hat and a dark red jacket or shirt. The Camaro pulled up slowly. Iraheta was driving. Martinez lifted up his hands and said, \u201cwhat\u2019s going on?\u201d As the Camaro passed the Honda, Iraheta fired a single gunshot at the Honda, and sped off. The shot shattered the Honda\u2019s driver\u2019s side window and hit Orozco in the neck, fatally wounding him. Neither Orozco nor Martinez was armed.</p>\n<p id=\"b562-11\">(2) <em>The investigation</em></p>\n<p id=\"b562-12\">Officers stopped the Camaro shortly after the shooting. Iraheta was driving. One of the officers found a gun under the Camaro\u2019s front passenger seat, <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"615\">*615</page-number>obscured by trash. The gun was loaded with six rounds, one of which was expended. Forensic testing revealed that the bullet that killed Orozco had been fired from the gun. At a field showup conducted shortly after the shooting, Martinez identified the Camaro and Iraheta. Officers did not find a gun in the Honda.</p>\n<p id=\"b563-5\">(3) <em>Statements by the other occupants of the Camaro</em></p>\n<p id=\"b563-6\">Moreno and Maciel testified that as it passed the Jr. Market, the Honda slowed and then sped off. En route to Maciel\u2019s house, the group came upon the Honda stopped in the middle of the road, blocking their path. Maciel asked Orozco to move. Martinez approached the back of the Camaro. Both Maciel and Moreno heard Richard say, \u201che\u2019s got a gun.\u201d Iraheta then pulled a gun from under the seat and fired a single shot at the Honda. In a recorded police interview, Moreno stated that Iraheta had followed the Honda after leaving the market.</p>\n<p id=\"b563-7\">(4) <em>Gang evidence</em></p>\n<p id=\"b563-8\">A gang expert testified regarding the characteristics and activities of the Inglewood 13 gang. Among other things, he opined that Iraheta was an Inglewood 13 gang member, based on his \u201cWest L.A.\u201d tattoo, attire, and association with other gang members. When given a hypothetical based on the facts of the case, the expert opined that the motive for the shooting was gang related.</p>\n<p id=\"b563-9\">B. <em>Defense evidence</em></p>\n<p id=\"b563-10\">Iraheta testified in his own defense. At the time of the shooting, he was 19 years old, had no criminal record, was in the military reserves, and was not a gang member. He and Maciel were planning on getting married, and he had just been hired by Bank of America and was enrolled to start classes at ITT Tech. His \u201cWest L.A.\u201d tattoo was not a gang tattoo. He had the gun for protection because he had been beaten up near his house by gang members a few months before the shooting.</p>\n<p id=\"b563-11\">On the night of the shooting, he drove by the Jr. Market and his friend Tovar flagged him down. While he and Tovar were talking, the Honda passed by. Tovar warned Iraheta that the occupants of the Honda had been \u201ccruising around and looking for trouble\u201d and had \u201cmad-dogg[edj\u201d him earlier that day. Iraheta left the Jr. Market a few minutes later. His route took him to 65th Street. The Honda was stopped in the street, blocking it. Martinez was standing outside the car, staring at Iraheta. Iraheta signaled to Martinez to move the car. Martinez then put up his hands up as if to say \u201cWhat\u2019s up?\u201d <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"616\">*616</page-number>Iraheta tried to go around the Honda. Martinez approached the back of the Camaro. When the Camaro was approximately parallel to the Honda, Richard said, \u201ckeep going. He gots a gun.\u201d Iraheta saw Orozco looking at him and saying something. Orozco had a small pistol in his hand and was tapping it on the Honda\u2019s window. Iraheta fired one round while simultaneously hitting the gas pedal. On cross-examination, Iraheta admitted he had previously testified that he was unsure whether Orozco had a gun or a cellular telephone in his hand.<footnotemark>4</footnotemark></p>\n<p id=\"b564-4\">2. <em>Procedure</em></p>\n<p id=\"b564-5\">An information filed on May 1, 2003, charged Iraheta with murder (\u00a7 187, subd. (a)). It also alleged that Iraheta personally and intentionally used and discharged a firearm, causing death (\u00a7 12022.53, subds. (b), (c) &amp; (d)). Iraheta was tried by a jury, convicted of second degree murder with the firearm enhancement, and sentenced to 40 years to life in prison. We affirmed his conviction in an unpublished opinion. <em>(People </em>v. <em>Iraheta </em>(Apr. 30, 2008, B173223.)<footnotemark>5</footnotemark> Among other things, we held Iraheta was properly convicted of second degree felony murder. <em>(People v. Iraheta, supra, </em>B173223.)</p>\n<p id=\"b564-6\">The California Supreme Court subsequently granted Iraheta\u2019s petition for review and, on June 10, 2009, transferred the case back to us with directions to vacate our decision and reconsider the cause in light of <em>People v. Chun </em>(2009) 45 Cal.4th 1172 [91 Cal.Rptr.3d 106, 203 P.3d 425], Upon reconsideration, we concluded <em>Chun </em>required reversal of Iraheta\u2019s murder conviction. <em>(People v. Iraheta </em>(Nov. 20, 2009, B173223) [nonpub. opn.].)<footnotemark>6</footnotemark></p>\n<p id=\"b564-7\">The People filed an amended information on October 5, 2010, again . charging Iraheta with murder (\u00a7 187, subd. (a); count 1), and a second amended information on October 3, 2011, adding a second count of shooting at an occupied motor vehicle (\u00a7 246; count 2). Iraheta\u2019s retrial commenced in March 2013. The jury found Iraheta guilty of shooting at an occupied motor vehicle, and found true the allegation he had personally and intentionally used and discharged a firearm, causing Orozco\u2019s death. It deadlocked on count 1, the murder charge, and the court declared a mistrial on that count. <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"617\">*617</page-number>Before sentencing, Iraheta filed motions for a new trial and arrest of judgment on a variety of grounds. On May 9, 2013, the trial court granted the new trial motion on the ground that it had erred in failing to instruct the jury on imperfect self-defense in regard to count 2, shooting at an occupied motor vehicle in violation of section 246.</p>\n<p id=\"b565-5\">On May 31, 2013, the People appealed the trial court\u2019s order. (\u00a7 1238, subd. (a)(3).) On July 24, 2013, we granted the People\u2019s petition for a writ of supersedeas and issued a stay of proceedings pending finality of this appeal.</p>\n<p id=\"b565-6\">DISCUSSION</p>\n<p id=\"b565-7\">1. <em>The trial court correctly declined to instruct on imperfect self-defense on count 2, shooting at an occupied motor vehicle.</em></p>\n<p id=\"b565-9\">A. <em>Additional facts</em></p>\n<p id=\"b565-10\">The defense requested that the court instruct the jury on \u201cimperfect\u201d self-defense as to both charged counts.<footnotemark>7</footnotemark> Defense counsel also requested an instruction on mistake of fact.<footnotemark>8</footnotemark> Defense counsel urged that imperfect self-defense could negate malice, an element of shooting at an occupied motor vehicle in violation of section 246. The People objected. The prosecutor pointed out that imperfect self-defense was not actually a defense, but operated only to reduce a murder to manslaughter, and was inapplicable to crimes other than murder. The trial court concluded the imperfect self-defense instruction was inapplicable to the charge of shooting at an occupied motor vehicle. It further reasoned that \u201cmistake of fact is basically imperfect self-defense,\u201d and declined to give that instruction because it was cumulative of the self-defense instructions already given.</p>\n<p id=\"b566-4\"><page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"618\">*618</page-number>Thereafter, the trial court instructed the jury on \u201cperfect\u201d self-defense as to both the murder and the shooting at an occupied motor vehicle charges.<footnotemark>9</footnotemark> It instructed on imperfect self-defense as to the murder charge only, as well as the difference between \u201cperfect\u201d and \u201cimperfect\u201d self-defense.<footnotemark>10</footnotemark></p>\n<p id=\"b566-5\">During deliberations, two jurors sent a note to the court asking whether, in regard to the section 246 charge and the lesser included offense of shooting a firearm in a grossly negligent manner, \u201cthe term self-defense include[s] both imperfect and complete self defense? [f] Or in those instances does \u2018self-defense\u2019 only mean complete self-defense?\u201d Consistent with its earlier ruling, and over a defense objection, the trial court informed the jury: \u201cImperfect self[-]defense does not apply to [section] 246 (willful and malicious shooting <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"619\">*619</page-number>into an occupied motor vehicle) or [section] 246.3 (negligently shooting into an occupied motor vehicle), [f] Only self-defense, or defense of another apply to these two charges.\u201d</p>\n<p id=\"b567-5\">Iraheta argued in his new trial motion that the jury should have been instructed that imperfect self-defense applied to the section 246 charge. Iraheta urged, as he had earlier, that an unreasonable belief in the need for self-defense could negate malice, an element of section 246. The People countered that the theory of imperfect self-defense is inapplicable to the crime of shooting at an occupied motor vehicle, and the legal principles relevant to mistake of fact were covered by other instructions.</p>\n<p id=\"b567-6\">Relying on <em>People v. McKelvy </em>(1987) 194 Cal.App.3d 694 [239 Cal.Rptr. 782], the trial court granted the new trial motion on the ground it had erred by failing to instruct on imperfect self-defense in regard to count 2, shooting at an occupied vehicle. The court reasoned that the authorities cited by the People <em>(People v. Watie </em>(2002) 100 Cal.App.4th 866 [124 Cal.Rptr.2d 258]; <em>People v. Sekona </em>(1994) 27 Cal.App.4th 443 [32 Cal.Rptr.2d 606]) held only that an imperfect self-defense instruction need not be given sua sponte, whereas here the defense requested the instruction. The court explained: \u201c[T]he reasoning in <em>McKelvy </em>makes sense to me. . . . [I]f this were a case where there were no cars involved and somebody is on one side of the sidewalk and another person is on the other side, and the exact same facts where somebody exhibits arguably a gun which in retrospect may not have been a gun, and the assailant shoots and kills that person, you have murder or manslaughter depending if it\u2019s imperfect self-defense, [f] But if [you] put walls around the people in a car or a house, you don\u2019t get the benefit of that argument. [f] And it\u2019s hard conceptually for me to grasp or associate any common sense with that argument unless there\u2019s some policy reasons I\u2019m just not considering.\u201d</p>\n<p id=\"b567-7\">B. <em>Discussion</em></p>\n<p id=\"b567-8\">A criminal defendant may move for a new trial on specified grounds, including instructional error. (\u00a7 1181; <em>People </em>v. <em>Ault </em>(2004) 33 Cal.4th 1250, 1260 [17 Cal.Rptr.3d 302, 95 P.3d 523]; <em>People </em>v. <em>Masotti </em>(2008) 163 Cal.App.4th 504, 507 [77 Cal.Rptr.3d 483].) The trial court has broad discretion in ruling on a new trial motion, and its decision will be disturbed only for clear abuse of that discretion. <em>(Ault, </em>at p. 1260; see generally <em>People v. Richmond </em>(1991) 2 Cal.App.4th 610, 618 [3 Cal.Rptr.2d 252].) Such an abuse of discretion arises if the court\u2019s decision is based on an incorrect legal standard. <em>(People v. Knoller </em>(2007) 41 Cal.4th 139, 156 [59 Cal.Rptr.3d 157, 158 P.3d 731].)</p>\n<p id=\"b568-3\"><page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"620\">*620</page-number>The People urge the trial court abused its discretion by granting a new trial here, because an imperfect self-defense theory cannot apply to crimes other than murder. Iraheta, on the other hand, urges that the trial court\u2019s ruling was correct, because imperfect self-defense can operate as \u201ca theory in mitigation to negate the element of malice.\u201d</p>\n<p id=\"b568-4\">\u201cThe doctrine of self-defense embraces two types: perfect and imperfect.\u201d <em>(People </em>v. <em>Rodarte </em>(2014) 223 Cal.App.4th 1158, 1168 [168 Cal.Rptr.3d 12].) \u201cPerfect\u201d self-defense requires that a defendant have an honest and reasonable belief in the need to defend himself or another. <em>(Ibid.) </em>Imperfect self-defense, sometimes referred to as a <em>\u201cFlannel </em>defense\u201d <em>(People </em>v. <em>Flannel </em>(1979) 25 Cal.3d 668 [160 Cal.Rptr. 84, 603 P.2d 1]; <em>People </em>v. <em>Quintero </em>(2006) 135 Cal.App.4th 1152, 1166 [37 Cal.Rptr.3d 884]), \u201cis the killing of another human being under the actual but unreasonable belief that the killer was in imminent danger of death or great bodily injury. [Citation.] Such a killing is deemed to be without malice and thus cannot be murder.\u201d <em>(People v. Booker </em>(2011) 51 Cal.4th 141, 182 [119 Cal.Rptr.3d 722, 245 P.3d 366]; see <em>People v. Duff (2014) </em>58 Cal.4th 527, 561-562 [167 Cal.Rptr.3d 615, 317 P.3d 1148].) Imperfect self-defense is therefore a \u201c \u2018theor[y] of partial exculpation\u2019 that reduce[s] murder to manslaughter by negating the element of malice.\u201d <em>(People v. Moye </em>(2009) 47 Cal.4th 537, 549 [98 Cal.Rptr.3d 113, 213 P.3d 652].) As explained by our Supreme Court: \u201c \u2018[Ujnreasonable self-defense\u2019 is . . . not a true defense; rather, it is a shorthand description of one form of voluntary manslaughter. And voluntary manslaughter, whether it arises from unreasonable self-defense or from a killing during a sudden quarrel or heat of passion, is not a defense but a crime; more precisely, it is a lesser offense included in the crime of murder.\u201d <em>(People v. Barton </em>(1995) 12 Cal.4th 186, 200-201 [47 Cal.Rptr.2d 569, 906 P.2d 531]; see <em>People v. Elmore </em>(2014) 59 Cal.4th 121, 134 [172 Cal.Rptr.3d 413, 325 P.3d 951].)</p>\n<p id=\"b568-5\">\u201cIt is settled that a violation of section 246 is a general intent crime.\u201d <em>(People v. Hernandez </em>(2010) 181 Cal.App.4th 1494, 1500 [105 Cal.Rptr.3d 597]; see <em>People v. Ramirez </em>(2009) 45 Cal.4th 980, 985, fn. 6 [89 Cal.Rptr.3d 586, 201 P.3d 466]; <em>People v. Overman </em>(2005) 126 Cal.App.4th 1344, 1356 [24 Cal.Rptr.3d 798]; <em>People v. Watie, supra, </em>100 Cal.App.4th at p. 879; <em>People v. Jischke </em>(1996) 51 Cal.App.4th 552, 556 [59 Cal.Rptr.2d 269].) Section 246 provides in pertinent part: \u201cAny. person who shall <em>maliciously and willfully </em>discharge a firearm at an . . . occupied motor vehicle ... is guilty of a felony. . . .\u201d (Italics added.) \u201cConviction under a statute proscribing conduct done \u2018willfully and maliciously\u2019 does not require proof of a specific intent. [Citation.]\u201d <em>(People </em>v. <em>Licas </em>(2007) 41 Cal.4th 362, 366 [60 Cal.Rptr.3d 31, 159 P.3d 507]; see <em>People </em>v. <em>Rodarte, supra, </em>223 Cal.App.4th at p. 1168; <em>Hernandez, </em>at p. 1500; <em>People v. Atkins </em>(2001) 25 Cal.4th 76, 85-86 [104 Cal.Rptr.2d 738, 18 P.3d 660]; <em>People </em>v. <em>Alvarado </em>(2005) 125 Cal.App.4th 1179, 1188 [23 Cal.Rptr.3d 391].) \u201cSection 7, subdivision 1, <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"621\">*621</page-number>states: \u201cwillfully,\u201d . . . implies simply a purpose or willingness to commit the act . . . referred to. It does not require any intent to violate law, or to injure another, or to acquire any advantage.\u2019 \u2018Maliciously\u2019 is defined as \u2018a wish to vex, annoy, or injure another person, or an intent to do a wrongful act, established either by proof or presumption of law.\u2019 (\u00a7 7, subd. 4.)\u201d <em>(Licas, </em>at p. 366.) \u201c \u2018 \u201cWhen the definition of a crime consists of only the description of a particular act, without reference to intent to do a further act or achieve a future consequence, we ask whether the defendant intended to do the proscribed act. This intent is deemed to be a general criminal intent. . . . The only intent required for a general intent offense is the purpose or willingness to do the act or omission. [Citation.]\u201d \u2019 \u201d (Rodarte, at p. 1168; see <em>Hernandez, </em>at p. 1500; <em>People v. Verlinde </em>(2002) 100 Cal.App.4th 1146, 1166-1167 [123 Cal.Rptr.2d 322].) Thus, for section 246, \u201c \u2018[a]s for all general intent crimes, the question is whether the defendant intended to do the proscribed act.\u2019 [Citation.] \u2018In other words, it is sufficient for a conviction (of section 246] if the defendant intentionally did that which the law declares to be a crime.\u2019 [Citation.]\u201d <em>(Overman, </em>at p. 1356; see <em>Jischke, </em>at p. 556.)</p>\n<p id=\"b569-5\">In granting Iraheta\u2019s new trial motion, the trial court relied primarily on <em>People </em>v. <em>McKelvy, supra, </em>194 Cal.App.3d 694. In <em>McKelvy, </em>a single justice concluded the unreasonable self-defense doctrine applied to the general intent crime of mayhem, and the court had a sua sponte duty to instruct on the doctrine. <em>(Id. </em>at pp. 702-704.) <em>McKelvy </em>reasoned that inclusion of the word \u201cmaliciously\u201d in the mayhem statute required proof of something more than an intentional act. The lead opinion reasoned: \u201cAlthough the \u2018malice\u2019 required for the offense of mayhem differs from the \u2018malice aforethought\u2019 with which <em>Flannel </em>was concerned, it is equally true in both cases that the requisite state of mind is inconsistent with a genuine belief in the need for self-defense. One who truly believes there is a need for self-defense cannot be said to act with intent to \u2018vex, injure or annoy\u2019 and may be found guilty of no more than an assault or battery.\u201d <em>(Id. </em>at p. 702, fn. omitted.)</p>\n<p id=\"b569-6\"><em>McKelvy </em>is not persuasive for several reasons. First, the lead opinion did not command a majority for its conclusion because the two nonauthoring justices concurred only in the result. (See <em>People </em>v. <em>Vallejo </em>(2013) 214 Cal.App.4th 1033, 1040 [154 Cal.Rptr.3d 341] [the <em>McKelvy </em>lead opinion \u201cis not binding authority\u201d]; <em>People v. Quintero, supra, </em>135 Cal.App.4th at p. 1166; <em>People v. Sekona, supra, </em>27 Cal.App.4th at p. 451.) Second, the lead opinion\u2019s conclusion regarding the imperfect self-defense instruction \u201cwas dictum, because the court affirmed the defendant\u2019s conviction despite the absence of a Flannel instruction.\u201d <em>(People </em>v. <em>Hayes </em>(2004) 120 Cal.App.4th 796, 801-802 [15 Cal.Rptr.3d 884].) Third, no other reported decision has followed <em>McKelvy, </em>and its reasoning \u201chas been uniformly rejected.\u201d <em>(People v. Rodarte, supra, </em>223 Cal.App.4th at p. 1169; see <em>People </em>v. <em>Szadziewicz </em>(2008) 161 Cal.App.4th 823, 835 [74 Cal.Rptr.3d 416].) Indeed, appellate courts <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"622\">*622</page-number>since <em>McKelvy </em>have held imperfect self-defense instructions are inapplicable or need not be given sua sponte when the defendant is charged with mayhem.</p>\n<p id=\"b570-4\"><em>People v. Sekona, supra, </em>27 Cal.App.4th 443, held that a trial court has no sua sponte duty to instruct on unreasonable self-defense in relation to a mayhem charge. <em>(Id. </em>at pp. 450, 457.) In a scholarly opinion, <em>Sekona </em>explained that no statute required, and no Supreme Court case had held, that an unreasonable belief in the need for self-defense negated mayhem\u2019s malice element. Because application of the imperfect self-defense doctrine to mayhem was not a general principle of law, a trial court had no sua sponte duty to instruct on it. <em>(Id. </em>at pp. 450-451.) Further, the California Supreme Court had not held such a sua sponte duty existed \u201cin any context other than murder.\u201d <em>(Id. </em>at p. 451.) <em>People </em>v. <em>Flannel, supra, </em>25 Cal.3d 668, considered only the \u201c \u2018malice aforethought\u2019 \u201d required for murder, not the \u201c \u2018malice\u2019 \u201d required for mayhem, which are legally distinct concepts. <em>(Sekona, </em>at pp. 452-453.) The concept of malice under section 7, subdivision 4 was distinguishable from the malice aforethought required for murder. <em>(Sekona, </em>at p. 453; <em>People v. Rodarte, supra, </em>223 Cal.App.4th at p. 1169.) <em>Sekona </em>traced the development of the crime of mayhem under the English common law and California\u2019s statutory scheme, and concluded that unlike the crime of murder, \u201cmayhem involves a different requisite mental state and has no statutory history recognizing a malice aforethought element or the availability of the <em>Flannel </em>defense.\u201d <em>(Sekona, </em>at p. 457.)</p>\n<p id=\"b570-5\"><em>People v. Hayes, supra, </em>120 Cal.App.4th at page 801, similarly concluded the doctrine of imperfect self-defense \u201chas no application to a charge of mayhem.\u201d The court explained: \u201cWe do not agree that a belief in the necessity for self-defense can negate an \u2018intent to vex, injure or annoy.\u2019 Such an intent lacks the crucial characteristic of \u2018malice aforethought\u2019 said in <em>Flannel </em>to justify the defense, i.e., awareness that one\u2019s conduct does not conform to the expectations of society.\u201d <em>(Id. </em>at p. 802.) \u201c[Mjalice aforethought reflects or embodies a realization by the actor that his or. her conduct <em>violates social expectations. </em>It is this realization that cannot be reconciled with an actor\u2019s belief that he or she is acting in self-defense, because society approves the reasonable use of force to that end. [][] This rationale cannot be extended to the more general concept of \u2018malice\u2019 as defined in section 7 and incorporated in the statutory definition of mayhem. That definition connotes no element of knowing violation of social norms. It requires only [an] intent to vex, injure, or annoy. A belief that one is acting in self-defense, whether reasonable or unreasonable, has no tendency to negate the element of malice. Indeed the intent to vex, injure, or annoy may be present when one acts in <em>reasonable </em>self-defense. Such a circumstance affords a defense not because it negates the element of malice but because it <em>excuses or justifies </em>the conduct in question despite the intent to injure.\u201d <em>(Id. </em>at p. 803, fn. omitted.) The court summed up: \u201c[W]hereas \u2018malice aforethought\u2019 betokens a willingness to <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"623\">*623</page-number>violate social standards of conduct, \u2018malice\u2019 under section 7, subdivision 4 requires only an intent to injure, vex, or annoy. One who believes his or her conduct is necessary for self-defense does not manifest a willingness to violate social norms, but may very well manifest a desire to injure. It follows that the <em>Flannel </em>defense has no application to a charge of mayhem.\u201d <em>(Id. </em>at p. 804.)</p>\n<p id=\"b571-5\">Other cases are in accord. (See <em>People </em>v. <em>Quintero, supra, </em>135 Cal.App.4th at p. 1167 [the <em>Sekona </em>and <em>Hayes </em>rationale that imperfect self-defense is inapplicable to the crime of mayhem also pertains to aggravated mayhem]; <em>People </em>v. <em>Szadziewicz, supra, </em>161 Cal.App.4th at p. 836 [\u201cBecause the theory of unreasonable self-defense does not apply to a charge of aggravated mayhem, the trial court had no duty to instruct on that theory . . . either sua sponte or on request.\u201d].)</p>\n<p id=\"b571-6\">Several cases have likewise held an imperfect self-defense instruction need not be given sua sponte or is inapplicable to section 246 \u00e1nd similar crimes. In <em>People v. Watie, supra, </em>100 Cal.App.4th 866, as here, the defendant was charged with violation of section 246, among other offenses. <em>Watie </em>rejected the contention that the trial court erred by failing to sua sponte instruct on imperfect self-defense: \u201cAt the time of trial, as now, no authority suggests that the nondefense of imperfect, or unreasonable, self-defense could apply in a prosecution for violation of section 246. Such a legal theory would be at odds with <em>Barton\u2019s </em>characterization of unreasonable self-defense as a species of voluntary manslaughter.\u201d <em>(Watie, </em>at p. 882.) Because no authority so held, application of unreasonable self-defense to a section 246 charge was not a general principle of law requiring sua sponte instruction. (100 Cal.App.4th at p. 882.)</p>\n<p id=\"b571-7\">In <em>People </em>v. <em>Vallejo, supra, </em>214 Cal.App.4th 1033, the defendant was convicted of, inter alia, shooting from a motor vehicle (former \u00a7 12034, subd. (c), now \u00a7 26100, subd. (c)), which, like section 246, required proof the defendant acted maliciously. Relying on <em>Sekona </em>and <em>Hayes, Vallejo </em>rejected <em>McKelvy\u2019s </em>analysis. <em>(Vallejo, </em>at p. 1041.)</p>\n<p id=\"b571-8\">Most recently\u2014and after the trial court\u2019s ruling in the instant matter\u2014our colleagues in Division One held that a trial court did not err by failing to instruct on imperfect self-defense on a charge of shooting from a motor vehicle (\u00a7 26100, subds. (c) &amp; (d).) <em>(People v. Rodarte, supra, </em>223 Cal.App.4th at p. 1171.) In <em>Rodarte', </em>as here, the defendant\u2019s request for an imperfect self-defense instruction was denied. <em>(Id. </em>at p. 1167.) During deliberations the jury asked for clarification of the difference between perfect and imperfect self-defense, and the court advised that imperfect self-defense was inapplicable to the shooting from a motor vehicle counts. <em>(Ibid.) Rodarte </em><page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"624\">*624</page-number>explained that the doctrine of imperfect self-defense \u201cis limited to the negation of the malice element of murder.\u201d <em>(Id. </em>at p. 1168.) The court reasoned: \u201cThe \u2018malice\u2019 required for mayhem as well as a section 26100, subdivision (c) offense is the \u2018wish to vex, annoy, or injure another person.\u2019 (\u00a7 7, subd. 4.)\u201d <em>(Rodarte, </em>at p. 1171.) Relying on <em>Vallejo, Rodarte </em>explained: \u201cThe unreasonable self-defense theory for murder is based on the principle that a person who believes in the need for self-defense \u2018lacks the crucial characteristic of \u201cmalice aforethought\u201d [which is the] awareness that one\u2019s conduct does not conform to the expectations of society.\u2019 [Citation.] In contrast, the wish to \u2018vex, injure, or annoy\u2019 connotes a knowing violation of social norms, and is likely to be present even when one acts in reasonable self-defense. [Citation.] As a result, unreasonable self-defense simply has no application to the malicious discharge of a firearm from a motor vehicle. Because the jury was not asked to find defendant harbored \u2018malice aforethought\u2019 in his shooting from a motor vehicle, instruction with CALCRIM No. 604 [(imperfect self-defense)] would have been inappropriate. Shooting from a motor vehicle requires only the general concept of malice as defined in section 7;. therefore, instruction [on] imperfect self-defense would have been inappropriate.\u201d <em>(Rodarte, </em>at p. 1171.)</p>\n<p id=\"b572-5\">Based on the foregoing, we conclude the trial court did not err by declining to instruct on imperfect self-defense. <em>Rodarte, </em>in particular, is on all fours with the instant matter. Although <em>Rodarte </em>involved section 26100, subdivision (c) (shooting from a motor vehicle) and the instant case involves section 246 (shooting at an occupied motor vehicle), the statutes contain the same language requiring that the defendant willfully and maliciously discharge a firearm. Indeed, the predecessor to section 26100, subdivision (c), former section 12034, subdivision (c), was patterned after section 246.<footnotemark>11</footnotemark> <em>(People </em>v. <em>Licas, supra, </em>41 Cal.4th at p. 368, fn. 2; see <em>People </em>v. <em>Hernandez, supra, </em>181 Cal.App.4th at p. 1500 [the crimes proscribed by \u00a7 246 and former \u00a7 12Q34 are analogous].) We agree with the analysis in <em>Rodarte </em>and the cases upon which it relied, and adopt their reasoning here.
