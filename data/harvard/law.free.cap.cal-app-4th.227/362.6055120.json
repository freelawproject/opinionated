Code, \u00a7 191.5, subd. (a)) (count 2), driving under the influence causing injury (Veh. Code, <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"365\">*365</page-number>\u00a7 23153, subd. (a))<footnotemark>1</footnotemark> (count 3), driving with a measurable blood-alcohol level causing injury (\u00a7 23153, subd. (b)) (count 4), and driving with a suspended license for an alcohol-related offense with a prior conviction (\u00a7 14601.1, subd. (a)) (count 5). With respect to counts 2 through 4, the jury also found that Diaz caused bodily injury or death to more than one victim, within the meaning of section 23558, and that he personally caused great bodily injury, within the meaning of Penal Code section 12022.7, subdivision (b). With respect to counts 3 and 4, the jury also found that Diaz had suffered two or more prior offenses for driving under the influence (\u00a7\u00a7 23626, 23546) and that he drove 20 or more miles per hour over the posted speed limit (\u00a7 23582, subd. (a)). With respect to count 5, the jury found that Diaz had suffered a prior conviction for violating section 14601.5, subdivision (a) within the previous five years. The jury was unable to reach a verdict on the charge of murder (Pen. Code, \u00a7 187) (count 1), and the trial court declared a mistrial as to that count.</p>\n<p id=\"b353-5\">The People later retried Diaz on the murder count, and the jury in the retrial found Diaz guilty of murder. The trial court sentenced Diaz to an aggregate term of 23 years to life. The court imposed a sentence of 15 years to life on count l.'The court also sentenced Diaz to a consecutive eight-year term on count 3, consisting of a three-year term on the underlying offense and an additional five years for the great bodily injury enhancement. The court imposed and stayed sentences on counts 2 and 4 pursuant to Penal Code section 654, and sentenced Diaz to time served on count 5.<footnotemark>2</footnotemark></p>\n<p id=\"b353-6\">On appeal, Diaz claims that the trial court erred in permitting the jury in the retrial on the murder charge to view two videos concerning the consequences of alcohol-related driving offenses. The videos include numerous tearful testimonials from the families of victims of alcohol-related offenses, statements from a prosecutor and a defense attorney concerning the high rates of convictions for such offenses, and statements from a judge to the effect that punishment is needed and is effective for alcohol-related driving offenses.</p>\n<p id=\"b353-7\">We conclude that the trial court erred in permitting the jury to view the videos. We further conclude that the error was prejudicial. Not only did the prosecutor repeatedly refer to the videos during closing argument, the jury asked questions during deliberations concerning subjects that were discussed only in the videos. Moreover, the record clearly indicates that the jury viewed <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"366\">*366</page-number>this as a close case, having twice reported to the judge that it was deadlocked. Finally, in the first trial, a jury that was not shown the videos was unable to reach a verdict on the murder charge. Under these circumstances,' there is a reasonable probability that Diaz would have received a more favorable result, but for the trial court\u2019s error in permitting the jury to view the videos.<footnotemark>3</footnotemark></p>\n<p id=\"b354-5\">Diaz also claims that his convictions on counts 3 and 4 must be reversed because they are lesser included offenses of count 2. In the unpublished .portion of this opinion, we conclude that reversal is not required on either count 3 or count 4 because the People presented evidence that the offenses charged in counts 3 and 4 were committed against different victims from the offense in count 2.</p>\n<p id=\"b354-6\">Accordingly, we reverse the murder conviction, affirm the convictions on the remaining counts, and remand the matter to the trial court with directions to permit the People to retry Diaz on the murder charge.</p>\n<p id=\"b354-7\">II.</p>\n<p id=\"b354-8\">FACTUAL BACKGROUND<footnotemark>4</footnotemark></p>\n<p id=\"AVf\">A. <em>Diaz\u2019s drinking prior to the crash</em></p>\n<p id=\"b354-9\">On August 28, 2008, Diaz drove his friends, Rolf Alvarez, Sergio Martinez, and Victor Sanchez, to a grocery store to purchase a 12-pack of beer, and then to a bar. On the way to the grocery store, Diaz was driving fast. Alvarez told him to slow down. The group drank beer on the way to the bar, and finished the 12-pack in the parking lot of the bar. They entered the bar at around 12:00 a.m.</p>\n<p id=\"b354-10\">While at the bar, Diaz consumed several mixed drinks. Martinez estimated that Diaz and Sanchez went to the bar to get drinks about six times. They stayed at the bar until approximately 1:00 or 1:30 a.m. According to Alvarez, by that time, Diaz was \u201cdrunk.\u201d Martinez decided to leave the bar with his girlfriend. Before leaving, Martinez told Alvarez to take the car keys away from Diaz.</p>\n<p id=\"b354-11\">In the parking lot of the bar, Alvarez twice asked Diaz if Alvarez could drive. Diaz insisted on driving and began to drive the three men from the bar. <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"367\">*367</page-number>Diaz drove to a house party a couple of miles from the bar. During the ride to the party, Diaz drove so fast that Alvarez asked him to slow down twice. Each time, Diaz slowed down and then sped up again.</p>\n<p id=\"b355-5\">B. <em>The crash</em></p>\n<p id=\"b355-6\">Alvarez, Sanchez, and Diaz stayed at the party for approximately 20 minutes. When they left the party, Diaz started to drive the group to a fast-food restaurant. Diaz was driving fast again. Alvarez told Diaz to slow down several times, but Diaz would slow down only briefly. Alvarez told Diaz to slow down one last time, but Diaz did not slow down. Diaz struck a curb and lost control of the car. The car became airborne, slid on its side, and hit a pole and a fence.</p>\n<p id=\"b355-7\">Rescue personnel arrived at the scene. They determined that Sanchez was dead.<footnotemark>5</footnotemark> Diaz did not appear to be injured, but did appear to be intoxicated.</p>\n<p id=\"b355-8\">C. <em>The investigation of the crash</em></p>\n<p id=\"b355-9\">An inspection of Diaz\u2019s car after the crash did not reveal any mechanical failures that would have caused the crash. In addition, it appeared that Diaz had not applied the brakes at the time of the crash.</p>\n<p id=\"b355-10\">An expert in accident reconstruction testified that, just prior to the crash, Diaz\u2019s car was traveling at approximately 102 miles per hour and that it appeared that Diaz had pushed the accelerator to the floor.</p>\n<p id=\"b355-11\">D. <em>Diaz\u2019s intoxication</em></p>\n<p id=\"b355-12\">Diaz\u2019s blood was drawn at the scene of the crash. Testing determined that he had a 0.21 percent blood-alcohol level. An expert testified that Diaz would have had to consume about 14 standard drinks to reach that level. The expert also testified that Diaz\u2019s blood-alcohol level was likely between 0.22 and 0.23 percent at the time of the crash.</p>\n<p id=\"b355-13\">E. <em>Diaz\u2019s prior convictions for drinking and driving and his participation in mandatory alcohol education programs</em></p>\n<p id=\"b355-14\">At the time of the crash, Diaz\u2019s driver\u2019s license was suspended. He had suffered two prior convictions for driving with an elevated blood-alcohol level. Diaz pled guilty in both prior cases. In connection with both prior <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"368\">*368</page-number>convictions, Diaz initialed a form that warned of the dangers of drinking and driving, including a statement that provided, \u201cIf I continue to drive while under the influence of alcohol or drugs, or both, and as a result of my driving, someone is killed, I can be charged with murder.\u201d</p>\n<p id=\"b356-5\">After suffering his first conviction, Diaz was ordered to attend a mandatory alcohol education program offered by an entity called Maximizing Access to Advance Our Communities (MAAC). Diaz registered for the MAAC program on December 3, 2007, but did not complete the program and was terminated in May of 2008. Prior to his termination from the program, Diaz had completed the first three education sessions, one group session, eight one-on-one sessions, and 12 self-help meetings.</p>\n<p id=\"b356-6\">During one of the MAAC sessions that Diaz attended, he viewed a video entitled \u201cCrossing the Line\u201d (MAAC Video). The video focused on the consequences of alcohol-related driving offenses in Delaware. Diaz also attended a mandatory education class offered by Mothers Against Drunk Driving (MADD) in which he viewed a video (MADD Video) that concerned the impact that two alcohol-related traffic fatalities had on the victims\u2019 families. The prosecution played both the MAAC Video and the MADD Video for the jury.</p>\n<p id=\"b356-7\">III.</p>\n<p id=\"b356-8\">DISCUSSION</p>\n<p id=\"b356-9\">A. <em>The trial court committed reversible error in permitting the jury to view the MAAC Video and the MADD Video</em></p>\n<p id=\"b356-10\">Diaz claims that the trial court committed reversible error in permitting the jury to view the MAAC Video and the MADD Video.</p>\n<p id=\"b356-11\">1. <em>Factual and procedural background</em></p>\n<p id=\"b356-12\">a. <em>Proceedings concerning the admissibility of the videos</em></p>\n<p id=\"b356-13\">Prior to Diaz\u2019s retrial on the murder charge, the People filed a motion in limine seeking permission to offer evidence that, prior to the crash in this case, Diaz had attended portions of the two mandatory alcohol education programs referred to in part H.E., <em>ante. </em>The People also sought permission to offer in evidence the' two videos that Diaz had viewed at the classes that he had attended. The People did not describe the content of the videos in their motion, but provided the court with transcripts of the MAAC Video and the MADD Video.</p>\n<p id=\"b357-4\"><page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"369\">*369</page-number>The People argued that the videos were relevant to demonstrate that Diaz was aware of the dangers of drinking and driving. The People further argued that the \u201ccontent of videos and lectures\u201d had been found to be admissible \u201cto the extent [they] contributed to the defendant\u2019s awareness of the danger of [driving under the influence].\u201d (Citing <em>People </em>v. <em>Murray </em>(1990) 225 Cal.App.3d 734, 745 [275 Cal.Rptr. 498] <em>(Murray).) </em>The People maintained that the trial court should not exclude either video from evidence pursuant to Evidence Code section 352 because \u201cthe People need to show what [Diaz] knew about the perils of driving impaired when he got into his vehicle on [the night of the crash.]\u201d</p>\n<p id=\"b357-5\">After conducting an off-the-record discussion concerning the admissibility of the videos, the trial court held a hearing on the subject. The court stated at the outset of the hearing that it had read transcripts of both videos, but that it had not viewed the MADD Video.<footnotemark>6</footnotemark> The court stated that its tentative ruling was to permit the People to \u201cuse both the [MAAC] and the MADD videos.\u201d The court indicated that it agreed with the prosecutor that the videos depicted two different perspectives concerning the consequences of consuming alcohol and driving. According to the trial court, the MAAC Video focused primarily on the defendant\u2019s perspective \u201cin terms of what he experiences,\u201d after committing an alcohol-related driving offense, while the MADD Video \u201cwas looking at. . . the damage that can be done\u201d as a result of an alcohol-related driving offense.</p>\n<p id=\"b357-6\">Defense counsel \u201cstrenuously objected\u201d to the admission of the videos. Counsel argued that the MADD Video contained highly emotional content, and that to permit the People to show the video at trial would allow the People to \u201cplay[] to the sentiment and heart strings of the jury.\u201d Counsel also argued; \u201cIt\u2019s talking about . . . [how the victim\u2019s] surviving family was devastated, this is a travesty, I could go on and on. I went through and underlined all the emotional words, it seems like a good third of the transcript has been underlined by me.\u201d</p>\n<p id=\"b357-7\">Defense counsel also argued that the circumstances of one of the cases discussed in the MADD Video were \u201ceerily similar to the facts in this case,\u201d thereby increasing the potential for prejudice. In addition, counsel argued that the MADD Video was cumulative to other evidence that demonstrated Diaz\u2019s awareness of the dangers of drinking and driving.</p>\n<p id=\"b357-8\">The People argued that the videos were admissible to show the \u201cstate of mind of [Diaz],\u201d in order to prove malice aforethought. The People further <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"370\">*370</page-number>argued that case law established that \u201cvideos and lectures are . . . admissible to the extent that [they] contributed to the [defendant\u2019s] awareness.\u201d The prosecutor also contended that the MADD Video was not cumulative in that it contained \u201ca completely different perspective.\u201d</p>\n<p id=\"b358-5\">Defense counsel reiterated his arguments that the prosecutor had numerous other ways to prove that Diaz was aware of the dangers of drinking and driving, and that the circumstances of one of the cases discussed in the video were very similar to the circumstances of the charged offense and therefore highly prejudicial. Defense counsel also argued that the video \u201cexcerpts from these two parents who lost their kids [(on the MADD Video)] is absolutely more prejudicial than probative in the sense that it inflames the passions of the jury.\u201d Counsel noted that at one point in the video, a mother of a deceased victim of a drunk driving crash discusses:, \u201cgoing to the mortuary and talking about feeling pain and desperation and then this mother who wanted to change her dead son\u2019s clothing at the mortuary and wasn\u2019t allowed to. Just reading in the hallway, I mean, it caused me to almost tear up. I just don\u2019t think that it\u2019s proper in a murder trial to bring that in . . . .\u201d</p>\n<p id=\"b358-6\">After hearing argument from counsel, the trial court ruled that it would not exclude the videos pursuant to Evidence Code section 352 and that the People would be permitted to show the videos at trial. The court acknowledged that one of the cases discussed in the video was \u201cvery similar\u201d to the circumstances of the charged offense, that the video was \u201cemotional,\u201d and that it pulled at \u201cheart strings.\u201d The court stated, \u201cI could go either way because there are so many issues in terms of would it be too prejudicial.\u201d<footnotemark>7</footnotemark> However, the court ultimately reasoned that the videos were \u201cmore probative than prejudicial\u201d in that Diaz had watched the videos, and had nevertheless done \u201cthe exact same thing that he saw in the video.\u201d</p>\n<p id=\"b358-7\">b. <em>The MAAC Video</em></p>\n<p id=\"b358-8\">During the trial, the People played for the jury an unedited version of the MAAC Video. The video, entitled \u201cCrossing the Line,\u201d<footnotemark>8</footnotemark> is approximately 29 minutes in duration. It shows the aftermath of several car crashes that occurred in the State of Delaware, including an alcohol-related crash in which a passenger was killed and a second victim was seriously injured, and another alcohol-related collision in which a drunk driver was rendered permanently brain damaged. Graphic crime scene photographs, newspaper headlines, and photographs of the injured and of the deceased while they were alive are displayed throughout the video.</p>\n<p id=\"b359-4\"><page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"371\">*371</page-number>The video begins with an inmate, David Bond, discussing an alcohol-related crash in which he was the driver, his former girlfriend Jill Sauder was seriously injured, and his friend Debbie De Santo was killed. Bond is depicted in a jail cell with the words \u201cCriminal Negligent Homicide\u201d printed on the screen. At one point, Bond states that he had been pulled over on several occasions before the crash, but that he had passed sobriety tests.</p>\n<p id=\"b359-5\">In describing the crash, Bond states, \u201cI definitely did not have the proper frame of mind ... to operate a motor vehicle that night. One beer would-be too many. Um, I know this now, but four to five, I shouldn\u2019t have even thought about it.\u201d A state trooper also discusses the crash and the evidence that he gathered after the crash. De Santo\u2019s sister and Sauder tearfully speak about De Santo\u2019s death, while the video displays newspaper headlines and grave markers. Bond\u2019s father talks about the crash and says, \u201cIt almost pales by comparison when you look at what happened to [De Santo\u2019s] family and what happens to our family, by comparison, because [my son] will be with us.\u201d</p>\n<p id=\"b359-6\">Bond\u2019s defense counsel states, \u201c[I]t\u2019s pretty clear in Delaware at least, that no matter who you are or where you come from, if you go to trial and you get convicted, you\u2019re gonna go to jail for a considerable period of time and the jail sentences are getting longer and longer.\u201d He also states, \u201c[N]o matter how good of a lawyer that you get, if the facts aren\u2019t in your favor and if there\u2019s nothing to work with . . . and if the jury rejects what your arguments are, it doesn\u2019t matter. It doesn\u2019t matter how much you pay that lawyer, it doesn\u2019t matter whether you bring somebody from, uh, California . . . who makes millions of dollars. Uh, the bottom line is the same in Delaware. If you get convicted of this type of a crime, you\u2019re gonna go to jail no matter who you are.\u201d</p>\n<p id=\"b359-7\">A Delaware deputy attorney general states, \u201cI would say that for the most part, if we seek an indictment in the case, there is about a 95 percent chance that you are going to ultimately be convicted.\u201d</p>\n<p id=\"b359-8\">In discussing his situation, Bond states that he has \u201ccriminally negligent homicide\u201d on his record, and that he has to \u201cdeal with the situation for [four] years of being incarcerated.\u201d Bond also somberly discusses how he has to \u201cdeal with\u201d the fact that he killed his friend who had \u201ca real bright future.\u201d Sauder tearfully remembers her friend, discussing her favorite music and a sweater that she once owned.</p>\n<p id=\"b359-9\">The second segment features Wade Collins, who is introduced with the word \u201cManslaughter\u201d displayed under his name on the screen. Collins discusses a drag race in which he killed a woman in a car that was not <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"372\">*372</page-number>involved in the race. The other driver in the race, Jason Jacono, also discusses the collision and the severe injuries that he suffered as a result. A state trooper discusses the severity of the crash and the manner in which the state police investigate such crashes generally, stating, \u201cAny scene we respond to, we treat it as it is. In our opinion it\u2019s, it\u2019s like homicide, it\u2019s a murder investigation until all of the elements are there.\u201d</p>\n<p id=\"b360-5\">At this point in the video, a Delaware judge appears and states, \u201cThe court is beginning to treat . . . juveniles the same as adults when it comes to death or serious physical injury caused by gross reckless driving, or driving while under the influence . . . .\u201d The judge then says, \u201c[Tjhe only message people truly understand is the punishment in those type[s] of cases. . . . That ... is the clearest message that the courts can send ... to the public, is to look at the sentences imposed upon these individuals . . . .\u201d The.judge adds, \u201c[Pjeople who get behind the wheel while they\u2019re drinking are people, a lot of them read the newspaper, understand the particular punishment and I think the punishment in this area has more deterrence than punishment for a lot of other crimes.\u201d The video then shows Collins talking about the \u201cnightmare\u201d of being incarcerated.</p>\n<p id=\"b360-6\">The third segment features a man, Tom Golden, sitting next to his flane\u00e9, Lauri Hanulik, who is in a hospital bed. Hanulik\u2019s name is placed on the screen with the words \u201cPermanently Brain Damaged\u201d printed below. Hanulik\u2019s eyes are open, but she appears to be in a comatose state. Golden explains that he had warned Hanulik that her drinking and driving would result in her death, but that she continued to drink and drive and that she was involved in an alcohol-related crash from which she became permanently brain damaged. Golden describes in graphic detail Hanulik\u2019s current physical state and the medical treatment that she receives in order to keep her alive.</p>\n<p id=\"b360-7\">A fourth segment discusses the aftermath of a crash in which the driver was driving between 90 and 95 miles per hour and four of five people in the speeding car were killed. The mother of one of the dead victims tearfully discusses going to the hospital and finding out that her daughter had been killed. A father discusses the loss of his son. The driver appears on the screen with the word \u201cManslaughter\u201d below his name. The driver discusses the mental anguish that he feels, knowing that he is responsible for his friends\u2019 deaths. A state trooper discusses the psychological trauma that both the perpetrators and the families of victims of drunk driving crashes suffer.</p>\n<p id=\"b360-8\">Near the end of the video, Sauder discusses riding in cars with people who have been drinking. She says, \u201c[Tjhe people in your car, they trust you with their life. I mean I trusted someone with my life and I almost lost it.\u201d Bond then talks about how those watching the video may dismiss it as just a <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"373\">*373</page-number>\u201cmovie about a kid that messed up.\u201d Bond closes by stating, \u201c[If] you get in that car and you\u2019ve had a drink, one drink, and someone hits you, and there\u2019s a fatality or there\u2019s an injury, you\u2019re at fault and you\u2019re exactly where I am. And it can happen. It has happened. I\u2019m proof.\u201d</p>\n<p id=\"b361-5\">c. <em>Defense counsel\u2019s renewed objection to the MAAC Video</em></p>\n<p id=\"b361-6\">At the conclusion of the playing of the video, outside the presence of the jury, defense counsel renewed his objection to the video, stating, \u201cI objected to this back in motions in limine . . . [and] the Court mled, over my objection, that it was admissible. I think . . . that\u2019s a major problem. I think it\u2019s going to be grounds for reversal.\u201d Defense counsel argued that the video contained \u201cmisstatements of law throughout that video.\u201d For example, counsel noted that one of the defendants on the video indicated that he would be incarcerated for four years for committing an alcohol-related driving homicide. Counsel argued that such a statement would \u201cleave this jury with the impression that their decision really doesn\u2019t make that big of a difference, look, all he\u2019s looking at is four years anyway.\u201d Counsel also objected to the Delaware prosecutor\u2019s statement concerning the extremely high conviction rates for alcohol-related driving offenses in that state and a defense attorney\u2019s statement suggesting that defendants who go to trial for alcohol-related driving offenses are likely to be convicted. Defense counsel also objected to the \u201cgross misstatement of the law\u201d made by Bond at the end of the video pertaining to the consequences of being involved in a crash after having just one drink.</p>\n<p id=\"b361-7\">The prosecutor responded by stating that she did not think that the video was \u201coverly prejudicial,\u201d and that the jury could be \u201cinstructed that laws are different from state to state and that their role isn\u2019t in the punishment.\u201d</p>\n<p id=\"b361-8\">After clarifying with the prosecutor that she had not sought admission of either the MAAC Video or the MADD Video at the first trial, the trial court stated that when the People had sought admission of the videos prior to this trial, \u201cthey had enough case law to support the position that the videos that the defendant sees in terms of his mental state . . . are . . . admissible.\u201d The court also stated, \u201cI wouldn\u2019t have ruled differently had I seen the [MAAC] Video\u201d prior to ruling on the People\u2019s motion in limine that the MAAC Video could be played for the jury at the trial.<footnotemark>9</footnotemark> The court further indicated that it would be willing to provide the jury with a curative instruction explaining that the \u201claw is different\u201d in California from the Delaware law described in the video.</p>\n<p id=\"b362-4\"><page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"374\">*374</page-number>After further discussions during which the court agreed that defense counsel had objected, prior to the trial, to the showing of the MAAC Video, defense counsel stated, \u201cI don\u2019t think that you can cure it. I think that it\u2019s reversible error.\u201d The court responded that, to the extent defense counsel was making a motion for a mistrial, the court would deny the motion.</p>\n<p id=\"b362-5\">d. <em>The curative instruction</em></p>\n<p id=\"b362-6\">At the next court session, the court addressed the jury, stating:</p>\n<p id=\"b362-7\">\u201cThe video you saw last Thursday was shown for a specific purpose. The video was made out of [the] State of Delaware, and did not properly state California law or punishment. You are ordered to disregard any statement made or identifying titles used concerning what the participants in the video were charged with or the punishment imposed, or what the law in Delaware is concerning drinking and driving and causing injury or death.</p>\n<p id=\"b362-8\">\u201cAnd you are further ordered to disregard any statements by the judge, prosecutor and defense attorney in the video concerning what happens to individuals charged with drinking and driving offenses in Delaware. You may not for any reason at all discuss or consider these issues during your deliberations, or let them influence your decision in any way.\u201d</p>\n<p id=\"b362-9\">e. <em>The trial court\u2019s ruling that the MAAC Video would not be received in evidence</em></p>\n<p id=\"b362-10\">That same day, the People moved to admit the MAAC Video in evidence. Defense counsel objected. The trial court indicated that it would consider the issue at a later time.</p>\n<p id=\"b362-11\">Later that day, outside the presence of the jury, the trial court held a further hearing on the admissibility of the MAAC Video. Defense counsel renewed his objection to the admission of the video pursuant to Evidence Code section 352. Defense counsel added that the court had given the curative instruction' over defense counsel\u2019s objection and that the instruction was not sufficient to cure the prejudice caused by the jury having viewed the MAAC Video. Defense counsel argued that the video should not be admitted in evidence for the additional reason that if it were admitted, the jury would be \u201cfree to view it in their deliberations.\u201d</p>\n<p id=\"b362-12\">The prosecutor reiterated that the MAAC Video was relevant to show Diaz\u2019s \u201cknowledge of the dangers of drinking and driving.\u201d The prosecutor also noted that the jury would be instructed at the close of the case that punishment is \u201cnot their purview.\u201d</p>\n<p id=\"b363-4\"><page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"375\">*375</page-number>The court expressed concern that if it were to admit the video in evidence, the jury could view the video again during deliberations, stating: \u201cMy problem with allowing them to see the movie again is that it did have a specific purpose, and that was to show\u2014at least arguably\u2014the intent and knowledge of the defendant. That\u2019s fine. The rest of the [video] and why I gave the curative instruction I do think falls within the realm of [Evidence Code] section 352; that it is much more prejudicial than it is probative. Because it brings up a lot of issues that are not part and parcel with knowledge, but it brings up a lot of issues of what happens in Delaware versus what happens in California. The down side of receiving it is that the jury has a right to request to see it again. The down side of not receiving it is almost minimal, because then it is categorized as demonstrative only. They\u2019ve see it once, they won\u2019t have a chance to see it again. And my inclination is not to allow them to see this again. So I am going to, with defense objection, sustain that. We\u2019re not receiving [the MAAC Video]. It\u2019s demonstrative only.\u201d</p>\n<p id=\"b363-5\">The prosecutor responded in part: \u201cYour honor, if I may, if it was demonstrative only, then it should not have been shown to the jury at all. They\u2019ve seen this. It\u2019s a piece of evidence that was marked. The People laid the foundation for it. And this goes to the heart of this case, which is what the defendant knew.\u201d</p>\n<p id=\"b363-6\">The prosecutor and the court then engaged in a lengthy discussion of whether the court\u2019s ruling precluded the prosecutor from discussing the video during closing argument. The court stated that the prosecutor would not be precluded from referring to the video during closing argument. The court also clarified that it had provided the curative instruction over defense counsel\u2019s objection.</p>\n<p id=\"b363-7\">f. <em>The MADD Video</em></p>\n<p id=\"b363-8\">Later during the trial, the People played the MADD Video. The video was shown without sound because the people who appear in the video speak in Spanish.<footnotemark>10</footnotemark> As the prosecutor played the video for the jury, an interpreter read the jury a transcript of the video in English. The court also provided the jury with transcripts of the video in both English and Spanish.</p>\n<p id=\"b363-9\">The MADD Video is approximately 33 minutes long and features two individuals, each of whom had a son who was killed in an alcohol-related crash. In the first segment, a mother discusses her son\u2019s death in a drunk <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"376\">*376</page-number>driving crash and the impact that his death had on her and the rest of the family. The mother is somber and cries through portions of the video. She begins by describing her son, saying \u201che liked jokes,\u201d \u201che liked to laugh,\u201d and \u201che was the happiest one in the family.\u201d The mother describes feeling \u201cparalyzed\u201d upon being told that her son had been killed, and how the man who informed her of her son\u2019s death gave her the son\u2019s crucifix and wallet. She describes \u201cbegg[ingj\u201d a woman at the mortuary to allow her to put different clothes on her son\u2019s body, and having her request denied: \u201c[Wjhen he was bom, when I took him home from the hospital, I changed him, and now that I wasn\u2019t going to have him, it was going to be the last time I would see him. I wanted to change him. And they told me no.\u201d</p>\n<p id=\"b364-5\">The woman also explains that the drank driver of the truck in which her son was killed was her son\u2019s friend: \u201cThat\u2019s why it was hard to accept that a friend could take the lives of . . . friends like that. To say, \u2018Let\u2019s go, I\u2019ll drive.\u2019 Friends should protect one another .... He will never know the pain we had.\u201d</p>\n<p id=\"b364-6\">The segment closes with the mother discussing the impact of her son\u2019s death on the rest of her family, explaining \u201cGabriel [(her son)] wasn\u2019t the only victim; there were a lot of us.\u201d She closes by stating, \u201c[G]ur lives will never be the same.\u201d The video contains photographs of the victim taken throughout his life, as well as a photograph of his grave marker.</p>\n<p id=\"b364-7\">The MADD Video also features a father who lost \u201chis only son\u201d to a drunk driver. The father reminisces about his son as a young boy and describes visiting his son in the hospital after the crash: \u201cAt first if I grabbed his hands, he would sometimes squeeze my hand. But doctors told me it was possible he was responding to me, or it was possible that it was just his muscles doing that without it having anything to do with his feelings. But I\u2019ll never, never know that.\u201d</p>\n<p id=\"b364-8\">The father also discusses the procedures and decisions made regarding his son\u2019s medical treatment, as well the family\u2019s decision to terminate life support. He speaks emotionally about the pain that he felt and the impact that his son\u2019s death had on his family and friends. The father\u2019s demeanor is somber throughout the video, and tearful at times.</p>\n<p id=\"b364-9\">2. <em>Standard of review</em></p>\n<p id=\"b364-10\">We review for an abuse of discretion the trial court\u2019s decision to permit the jury to view the videos. (See, e.g., <em>People v.

Evidence Code section 352 provides: \u201cThe court in its discretion may exclude evidence if its probative value is substantially outweighed by the probability that its admission will (a) necessitate undue consumption of time or (b) create substantial danger of undue prejudice, of confusing the issues, or of misleading the jury.\u201d</p>\n<p id=\"b365-8\">\u201c \u2018The \u201cprejudice\u201d referred to in Evidence Code section 352 applies to evidence which uniquely tends to evoke an emotional bias against the defendant as an individual and which has very little effect on the issues.\u2019 \u201d <em>(People v.

In such a circumstance, the evidence is unduly prejudicial because of the substantial likelihood the jury will use it for an illegitimate purpose.\u2019 \u201d <em>(People v.

California has followed the rule in vehicular homicide cases that \u2018when the conduct in question can be characterized as a wanton disregard for <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"378\">*378</page-number>life, and the facts demonstrate a subjective awareness of the risk created, malice may be implied . . . .\u2019 <em>(People </em>v. <em>Watson </em>(1981) 30 Cal.3d 290, 298 [179 Cal.Rptr. 43, 637 P.2d 279].)\u201d <em>(People v. Ortiz </em>(2003) 109 Cal.App.4th 104, 110 [134 Cal.Rptr.2d 467] <em>(Ortiz).) </em>California courts have also held on numerous occasions that, in proving implied malice, an accused\u2019s \u201c[p]rior convictions [for driving under the influence] and exposure to mandatory educational programs are admissible to show the accused\u2019s awareness of the life threatening risks of driving under the influence.\u201d <em>(People </em>v. <em>David </em>(1991) 230 Cal.App.3d 1109, 1115 [281 Cal.Rptr. 656]; see, e.g., <em>Ortiz, </em>supra, at pp. 112-113 [collecting numerous cases].)</p>\n<p id=\"b366-5\">In <em>Murray, supra, </em>225 Cal.App.3d at page 737, the defendant was convicted of four counts of murder after killing four people in a head-on collision while driving under the influence of alcohol. The <em>Murray </em>court noted that the People presented the following evidence related to the content of a mandatory alcohol education course that the defendant had attended as a result of a prior conviction for \u201calcohol-related reckless driving\u201d: \u201cCharles Lemke, a deputy sheriff, taught the alcohol education classes in appellant\u2019s 1983 traffic school. In his 10 hours of lessons, Lemke covered legal aspects of driving under the influence, historical and contemporary use of alcohol, and the long-term effects of alcohol on organs of the body. He taught that even small amounts of alcohol could impair the nervous system, the muscles, and the brain and lead to problems of judgment and lack of coordination. He taught that alcohol impairs the ability to make rational decisions and to judge distance and speed. He taught that alcohol reduces inhibitions and causes drivers to take abnormal chances, such as speeding and dodging in and out of traffic. He used films which demonstrated how driving performance declines as the blood-alcohol level increases, showed actual accidents involving drunk driving, and displayed the effect of alcohol on the brain. He used charts and curves demonstrating the number of drinks which average persons of different weights would require to reach prohibited blood-alcohol percentages, and he taught that beer has the same effects as liquor and wine.\u201d <em>(Id. </em>at p. 739.)</p>\n<p id=\"b366-6\">In concluding that the \u201ctrial court properly admitted evidence that in connection with appellant\u2019s three prior convictions of drunk driving and alcohol-related reckless driving, appellant completed mandatory education programs on the dangers of drunk driving,\u201d the <em>Murray </em>court reasoned that several courts had \u201cheld such evidence is relevant to show the accused\u2019s awareness of the life-threatening risks of drunk driving.\u201d <em>(Murray, supra, 225 </em>Cal.App.3d at pp. 744-745.) The <em>Murray </em>court also relied on evidence of the defendant\u2019s prior alcohol-related driving convictions and attendance at mandatory alcohol education programs in concluding that the People had presented sufficient evidence of implied malice to support the murder convictions. <em>(Id. </em>at p. 748.)</p>\n<p id=\"b367-4\"><page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"379\">*379</page-number>4. <em>The trial court erred in permitting the jury to view both the MAAC Video and the MADD Video</em></p>\n<p id=\"b367-5\">As an initial matter, the trial court should have viewed the videos prior to ruling that the People would be permitted to play them for the jury at trial. (See <em>People v. Holford </em>(2012) 203 Cal.App.4th 155, 174 [136 Cal.Rptr.3d 713] <em>(Holford) </em>[\u201cDefendant criticizes the trial court for not reviewing the video before mating its [Evidence Code] section 352 ruling. We do not condone this practice. The trial court should have reviewed the video before ruling on its admissibility.\u201d].) As the <em>Holford </em>court explained, \u201cThe nature of discretion requires that the court\u2019s decision be an informed one and not \u2018 \u201ca shot in the dark.\u201d \u2019 \u201d <em>(Ibid.) </em>While the People correctly note that the trial court stated that it had reviewed the transcripts of the videos prior to ruling that the videos could be shown at trial, a review of the transcripts should have alerted the court to the need to view the videos, in light of the potential for prejudice that the content of the transcripts conveys.<footnotemark>11</footnotemark> Viewing the videos, in turn, would have permitted to the court to assess the potentially extremely prejudicial impact of the videos\u2014an impact that one cannot fully appreciate from merely reading the cold transcripts.</p>\n<p id=\"b367-6\">The trial court\u2019s decision to permit the jury to view the MAAC Video and the MADD Video permitted the prosecution to present to the jury evidence unlike that which has previously been held to be admissible by any court in California. Despite the numerous vehicular homicide cases in which California courts have upheld the admission of evidence that a defendant participated in an alcohol education program prior to the commission of the charged murder, we are aware of no authority that would provide support for the admission of videos that contain highly emotional footage of victims and their families discussing the impact of alcohol-related crashes, unrelated to the charged offense.</p>\n<p id=\"b367-7\">On appeal, the People do not contend that there is any such authority.<footnotemark>12</footnotemark> Rather, the People argue, \u201cThe content of the [MAAC and MADD] <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"380\">*380</page-number>videos, describing the experiences of both defendants and victims of driving under the influence, are indistinguishable from the [driving under the influence] educational programs universally found to be admissible in a case like this.\u201d We disagree. The videos at issue in this case contain a large amount of extremely prejudicial material presented in a format uniquely likely to elicit precisely the type of prejudice that Evidence Code section 352 is designed to prevent.</p>\n<p id=\"b368-5\">To begin with, both videos contain the testimonials of multiple somber and tearful individuals discussing numerous alcohol-related vehicle crashes in which their loved ones were killed. The speakers on the videos describe in vivid detail both the crashes and the impact that the crashes had on them and their families. After having viewed the videos, we can say with near certainty that the jurors in this case would have felt sympathy for the families of the victims of the alcohol-related crashes discussed in the videos.</p>\n<p id=\"b368-6\">Allowing the jury to view the videos created a substantial danger of inflaming the jury\u2019s passions by engendering similar feelings of sympathy for the victims of the charged offenses and their families. (Cf. <em>People </em>v. <em>Arias </em>(1996) 13 Cal.4th 92, 160 [51 Cal.Rptr.2d 770, 913 P.2d 980] [\u201cIt is \u2018settled that an appeal to the jury to view the crime through the eyes of the victim\u2019 \u201d and \u201c \u2018an appeal for sympathy for the victim is out of place during an objective determination of guilt.\u2019 \u201d].) The likelihood of this type of undue prejudice was particularly high in light of the fact that speakers portrayed in both the MADD Video and the MAAC Video described alcohol-related traffic fatalities that shared many similarities with the charged offense. In the MADD Video, a mother describes a scenario in which her son went out with a group of friends and the driver, who had been drinking alcohol, crashed the vehicle. Her son, a passenger, was killed in the crash. In the MAAC Video, Bond described going to a bar with friends, consuming alcohol at the bar, driving while intoxicated, crashing the vehicle, and injuring one passenger and killing another passenger.</p>\n<p id=\"b368-7\">The videos contain numerous images that serve to heighten the emotional impact of the videos. The MADD Video contains several images of the deceased victims taken throughout their lives, as well as a grave marker for one of the victims, while the MAAC Video contains multiple photographs of crime scenes that depict severely damaged vehicles, debris and blood spatter, newspaper headlines, and photographs of grave markers. In addition, the <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"381\">*381</page-number>MAAC Video contains video footage of a brain damaged woman who was injured in a drunk driving collision, as well as a graphic discussion of the medical procedures that are required in order to keep her alive. These depictions heightened the possibility that the emotions of the jury would be inflamed and would cause the jury to feel scorn and hostility toward Diaz as the perpetrator of an alcohol-related driving offense.</p>\n<p id=\"b369-5\">The MAAC Video also contains numerous statements that were entirely irrelevant to the case, and were highly prejudicial in that they suggested to the jury that it would be acting in an aberrant fashion if it were to find Diaz not guilty. For example, on the MAAC Video, both a prosecutor and a defense attorney make statements that suggest that those who are charged with alcohol-related driving offenses are likely to be found guilty.<footnotemark>13</footnotemark> Perhaps even more wrought with the potential for prejudice is footage in the MAAC Video of a judge stating that punishment is the \u201conly message people truly understand ... in [these] type[s] of cases,\u201d and that \u201cpunishment in this area has more deterrenft] [effect] than punishment for a lot of other crimes.\u201d As Diaz argues in his brief, \u201cThere simply is no relevance to the conviction rates, defense probabilities and sentences in any case much less those from another jurisdiction.\u201d (See, e.g., <em>People v. Honeycutt </em>(1977) 20 Cal.3d 150, 157, fn. 4 [141 Cal.Rptr. 698, 570 P.2d 1050] [\u201cA defendant\u2019s possible punishment is not, of course, a proper matter for juror consideration . . . .\u201d].)</p>\n<p id=\"b369-6\">In addition, one of the inmates in the MAAC Video, David Bond, states that he would be incarcerated for four years.<footnotemark>14</footnotemark> Not only is this punishment-related comment entirely irrelevant to proving the charged offense, it was also uniquely likely to cause prejudice in that the statement implicitly suggested that Diaz would be incarcerated for a similar, relatively short, period of time if convicted since Bond, like Diaz, was responsible for an alcohol-related crash in which one of his friends died and a second friend was seriously injured.</p>\n<p id=\"b369-7\">In short, the videos are highly inflammatory, appeal to the jurors\u2019 sense of sympathy and passion, improperly depict jail conditions, contain discussions of potential sentences, and include statements of law that have no relevance <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"382\">*382</page-number>to the case and that were likely to mislead the jury.<footnotemark>15</footnotemark> While the videos may have had probative value in demonstrating Diaz\u2019s awareness of the dangers of drinking and driving in proving implied malice, the People had ample other evidence that would have established this element and that would not have presented the substantial risk of severe prejudice that allowing the jury to view the videos did. In addition to evidence of Diaz\u2019s extreme intoxication and reckless driving, such evidence included certified court records showing Diaz\u2019s two prior convictions for alcohol-related driving offenses, documents from the prior convictions in which Diaz acknowledged the dangers of drunk driving, other evidence of Diaz\u2019s participation in alcohol education programs, and Alvarez\u2019s and Martinez\u2019s testimony that they attempted to dissuade Diaz from driving and repeatedly asked Diaz to slow down. (See pt. II., <em>ante.)</em></p>\n<p id=\"b370-5\">Having the jury view the highly inflammatory content of the two videos for the purpose of establishing Diaz\u2019s knowledge of the dangers of drinking and driving exposed the jury to evidence that would otherwise be patently and indisputably inadmissible. Given the near certain potential for undue prejudice and the marginal legitimate probative value of the videos, the trial court should have exercised its discretion in the only reasonable manner, and ruled the videos inadmissible.<footnotemark>16</footnotemark> While we are cognizant that it is the rare case in which a trial court\u2019s evidentiary rulings are determined to be erroneous, for the reasons stated above, we conclude that this is such a case. (See <em>People v. Lang </em>(1989) 49 Cal.3d 991, 1050 [264 Cal.Rptr. 386, 782 P.2d 627] [observing that the abuse of discretion standard of review in the evidentiary context \u201ccalls for deference\u2014but it does not, and cannot, require abdication\u201d].)</p>\n<p id=\"b370-6\">Accordingly, we conclude that the trial court erred in permitting the jury to view the videos.</p>\n<p id=\"b370-7\">5. <em>The error requires reversal</em></p>\n<p id=\"APP\">a. <em>Standard of prejudice</em></p>\n<p id=\"b370-8\">Diaz claims that permitting the jury to view the videos violated his due process right to a fair trial and thus, that the <em>Chapman </em>standard of prejudice applies. (See <em>Chapman v. California </em>(1967) 386 U.S. 18, 24 [17 L.Ed.2d 705, <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"383\">*383</page-number>87 S.Ct. 824] [\u201cbefore a federal constitutional error can be held harmless, the court must be able to declare a belief that it was harmless beyond a reasonable doubt\u201d].) The People argue that the <em>Watson</em><footnotemark><em>17</em></footnotemark><em> </em>standard of prejudice applies because the mere erroneous exercise of discretion under the ordinary rules of evidence generally does not implicate the federal Constitution. (See, e.g., <em>People v. Samuels </em>(2005) 36 Cal.4th 96, 114 [30 Cal.Rptr.3d 105, 113 P.3d 1125].) Under <em>Watson, </em>the reviewing court must affirm the judgment if it is \u201cnot reasonably probable that a result more favorable to defendant would have been reached in the absence of the error . . . .\u201d <em>(Watson, supra, </em>46 Cal.2d at p. 837.)</p>\n<p id=\"b371-5\">We assume for purposes of this decision that the trial court\u2019s error did not rise to the level of a federal constitutional violation because it is clear that even under the more lenient <em>Watson </em>standard, reversal is required.</p>\n<p id=\"b371-7\">b. <em>Application</em></p>\n<p id=\"b371-8\">As noted above, the videos were extremely likely to inflame the jury\u2019s passions against Diaz. While the trial court provided a curative instruction after the jury viewed the MAAC Video in an attempt to lessen the prejudice from having exposed the jury to irrelevant \u201cstatements by the judge, prosecutor and defense attorney in the video concerning what happens to individuals charged with drinking and driving offenses in Delaware,\u201d the instruction was inadequate. To begin with, the primary point of the MAAC Video was, in fact, to illustrate \u201cwhat happens to individuals charged with drinking and driving offenses in Delaware.\u201d Thus, the trial court\u2019s curative instruction was an attempt to unring not just a bell, but an entire carillon.<footnotemark>18</footnotemark> (See <em>People v. Hill </em>(1998) 17 Cal.4th 800, 845-846 [72 Cal.Rptr.2d 656, 952 P.2d 673] [\u201c \u2018It has been truly said: \u201cYou can\u2019t unring a bell.\u201d \u2019 [Citation.] Here, the jury heard not just a bell, but a constant clang . . . .\u201d].) In addition, the trial court\u2019s curative instruction did not address the substantial danger that the jury\u2019s passions would be inflamed by showing emotional testimonials of the families of victims of alcohol-related driving offenses that were similar to the charged offense. The trial court\u2019s subsequent refusal to admit the MAAC Video in evidence did not, and could not, eliminate the prejudice caused by having shown the video to the jury. As the prosecutor stated in arguing for the <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"384\">*384</page-number>MAAC Video\u2019s admission, \u201c[I]t should not have been shown to the jury at all,\u201d if the court was unwilling to admit the MAAC Video in evidence.<footnotemark>19</footnotemark></p>\n<p id=\"b372-5\">Compounding the prejudice caused by allowing the jury to view the videos, the prosecutor referred to the videos <em>five </em>times during closing argument. The prosecutor read quotations of statements made in both videos, and even referred to statements made by the Delaware prosecutor and judge in the video despite the court\u2019s instruction to the jury that it should disregard those statements.<footnotemark>20</footnotemark> A prosecutor\u2019s reference to evidence that should not have been presented to the jury increases the potential for prejudice flowing from the error. (See, e.g., <em>People v. Cruz </em>(1964) 61 Cal.2d 861, 868 [40 Cal.Rptr. 841, 395 P.2d 889] [\u201cThere is no reason why we should treat this evidence as any less \u2018crucial\u2019 than the prosecutor\u2014and so presumably the jury\u2014treated it.\u201d]; compare with <em>People v. Gonzales </em>(2013) 56 Cal.4th 353, 391 [154 Cal.Rptr.3d 38, 296 P.3d 945] [concluding erroneous admission of evidence was harmless where \u201cin his closing argument, the district attorney did not emphasize the evidence affected by the trial court error . . .\u201d].)</p>\n<p id=\"b372-6\">The record also contains several additional indicia of prejudice caused by the showing of the videos. During deliberations, the jury asked two questions about \u201cmanslaughter,\u201d a charge that was not presented in the case, and that was mentioned only in the MAAC Video. These questions suggest that the jury discussed the MAAC Video during deliberations, as the prosecutor acknowledged in the trial court while discussing with the court and defense counsel how the court should respond to one of the jury\u2019s questions: \u201cThe concern is the fact that they are bring[ing] up or talking about stuff that is not in evidence in this case .... Because they are obviously talking about manslaughter, which is not in evidence or any charge in this case. They have one charge. . . . Because ... the issue of manslaughter, I mean, that came up only in the [MAAC] [V]ideo, which the Court instructed them not to consider. ...\u201d</p>\n<p id=\"b372-7\">Further, the record unequivocally indicates that the jury viewed this as a close case. The jury asked for a readback of both Alvarez\u2019s testimony and <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"385\">*385</page-number>closing arguments, asked two questions concerning the meaning of implied malice, deliberated for a lengthy period of time, and reported itself deadlocked on more than one occasion.<footnotemark>21</footnotemark> (See <em>People v. West </em>(1983) 139 Cal.App.3d 606, 610 [189 Cal.Rptr. 36] [\u201cThe closeness of this case is demonstrated by the fact that the jury asked for rereading of a substantial portion of the testimony, asked for a rereading of some instructions and at one point reported itself deadlocked.\u201d].) In addition, one juror requested to be excused because he or she had \u201cdoubt,\u201d and two other jurors sent notes to the trial court indicating that several jurors were unwilling to find Diaz guilty of murder <footnotemark>22</footnotemark> These manifestations of the closeness of the case in the jury\u2019s eyes establish that Diaz may have obtained a more favorable result but for the trial court\u2019s error in allowing the jury to view the videos. (See <em>People </em>v. <em>Soojian </em>(2010) 190 Cal.App.4th 491, 520 [118 Cal.Rptr.3d 435] [\u201c[U]nder the <em>Watson </em>standard a hung jury is considered a more favorable result than a guilty verdict.\u201d].)</p>\n<p id=\"b373-5\">Finally, the previous trial resulted in a hung jury on the murder charge. This, too, supports a finding of prejudice in light of the fact that the evidence presented at both .trials was similar, with the significant exception that the videos were <em>not </em>shown at the first trial. (See, e.g., <em>People </em>v. <em>Kelley </em>(1967) 66 Cal.2d 232, 245 [57 Cal.Rptr. 363, 424 P.2d 947] [\u201cNot only is the prejudicial nature of the erroneously admitted evidence obvious, but it is also the fact that at the first trial when such evidence was excluded the jury was unable to agree but at this trial when the evidence was admitted a unanimous verdict resulted. The two trials being otherwise substantially similar, such fact demonstrates almost to a certainty the prejudicial nature of the error.\u201d].)</p>\n<p id=\"b373-6\">We acknowledge, as the People argue in.their brief, that the prosecution presented strong evidence of Diaz\u2019s guilt. Not only did the People present overwhelming evidence that .Diaz drove extremely recklessly while having a very high blood-alcohol level, the People presented considerable other evidence, apart from the videos, that Diaz harbored implied malice. (See pt. III.A.4., <em>ante.) </em>However, in light of the overwhelming indicia of prejudice discussed above, we conclude that it is reasonably probable that Diaz would have received a more favorable result but for the trial court\u2019s error.</p>\n<p id=\"b374-4\"><page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"386\">*386</page-number>Under these circumstances, we are compelled to reverse the judgment. <em>(Watson, supra, </em>46 Cal.2d at p. 837.)</p>\n<p id=\"b374-5\">B. <em>Diaz\u2019s convictions on counts 3 and 4 are not precluded as lesser included offenses to count 2</em><footnotemark><em>*</em></footnotemark></p>\n<p id=\"b374-6\">IV.</p>\n<p id=\"b374-7\">DISPOSITION</p>\n<p id=\"b374-8\">Diaz\u2019s conviction on count 1, for murder, is reversed and his sentence is vacated.

If Diaz is retried and found guilty of murder, the trial court shall resentence Diaz on the murder conviction and counts 2 through 5. If Diaz is found not guilty of murder, the trial court shall resentence Diaz on counts 2 through 5.</p>\n<p id=\"b374-10\">In the event that the People elect not to retry Diaz on a charge of murder, the trial court shall resentence Diaz on counts 2 through 5. The trial court may conduct any necessary ancillary proceedings consistent with this opinion.</p>\n<p id=\"b374-11\">Nares, Acting P.

(a)).</p>\n</footnote>\n<footnote label=\"3\">\n<p id=\"b354-12\"> In light of our reversal of Diaz\u2019s murder conviction, we need not consider Diaz\u2019s contention that the trial court improperly coerced the jury\u2019s guilty verdict on the murder charge through the manner in which the court responded to various questions that the jury posed during deliberations.</p>\n</footnote>\n<footnote label=\"4\">\n<p id=\"b354-13\"> Because Diaz\u2019s primary argument on appeal pertains to an error that allegedly occurred in his second trial, we base our factual background on evidence presented at that trial.</p>\n</footnote>\n<footnote label=\"5\">\n<p id=\"b355-15\"> During the first trial, the People presented evidence that Alvarez was rendered a quadriplegic as a result of the crash.</p>\n</footnote>\n<footnote label=\"6\">\n<p id=\"b357-9\"> The court later indicated that it also had not viewed the MAAC Video prior to ruling on its admissibility.</p>\n</footnote>\n<footnote label=\"7\">\n<p id=\"b358-9\"> At another point in its ruling, the trial court stated, \u201c[T]here are strong arguments on both sides,\u201d and \u201cI don\u2019t disagree there are elements you could argue very strenuously the other way. . . .\u201d</p>\n</footnote>\n<footnote label=\"8\">\n<p id=\"b358-10\"> The video has been transmitted to this court as an exhibit.</p>\n</footnote>\n<footnote label=\"9\">\n<p id=\"b361-9\"> The trial court also stated, \u201cI didn\u2019t recall seeing this video .... But I would have allowed it.\u2019</p>\n</footnote>\n<footnote label=\"10\">\n<p id=\"b363-10\"> Prior to the showing of the MADD Video, defense counsel renewed his objection to the video. The trial court overruled the objection and ruled that the video could be played and would be received in evidence.</p>\n</footnote>\n<footnote label=\"11\">\n<p id=\"b367-8\"> We emphasize that we do not hold that a trial court necessarily commits reversible error by failing to view a video before ruling that the video may be shown to the jury. (See <em>Holford, supra, </em>203 Cal.App.4th at p. 174 [trial court may rely on an offer of proof in considering whether to permit jury to view a video at trial].) Rather, we conclude that in light of the People\u2019s offer of proof in this case, which consisted of the actual transcripts of the videos, it was incumbent upon the trial court to view the videos prior to ruling that they could be shown to the jury, because the transcripts contain many statements that should have alerted the court to the potential for extreme prejudice if the jury were to be shown the videos.</p>\n</footnote>\n<footnote label=\"12\">\n<p id=\"b367-9\"> In the trial court, the prosecutor argued that in <em>Murray, supra, </em>225 Cal.App.3d 734, the court held that the \u201ccontent of videos\u201d shown in a mandatory alcohol education class was admissible to demonstrate a defendant\u2019s knowledge of the dangers of drinking and driving. In fact, as described in part IU.A.S.b., <em>ante, </em>in <em>Murray </em>the prosecution presented testimony that <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"380\">*380</page-number>genetically <em>described </em>the types of information provided in the defendant\u2019s alcohol education class. (225 Cal.App.3d at p. 739.) The admissibility of actual videos similar to those shown to the jury in this case is not discussed in the opinion. However, based on the prosecutor\u2019s argument, the court was apparently under the misimpression that the <em>Murray </em>court had approved the admission of the videos.</p>\n</footnote>\n<footnote label=\"13\">\n<p id=\"b369-8\"> The MAAC Video also shows Bond making statements in which he suggests that a person would be guilty of an alcohol-related driving offense after having had a single drink and driving.</p>\n</footnote>\n<footnote label=\"14\">\n<p id=\"b369-9\"> Several inmates on the MAAC Video refer to their incarceration and the conditions of imprisonment, while depicted in prison garb in penal institutions with captions stating the offenses for which they had been convicted. As noted above, punishment is not a proper consideration for the jury.

Code, \u00a7 352), they were approximately an hour in combined length and thus were far from \u201cbrief and fleeting.\u201d <em>(People v.
