He contends his convictions should be reversed, as (1) the trial court committed misconduct during voir dire; (2) the court admitted testimonial hearsay in violation of his right to confront the witness under the Sixth Amendment of the federal Constitution; and (3) there was insufficient evidence to support the vandalism conviction. He further contends <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"208\">*208</page-number>the court lacked authority to issue a protective order forbidding him to contact his son and stepdaughter for the next 10 years, except through counsel. The People request that this court amend the abstract of judgment to correct appellant\u2019s presentence custody credits and otherwise affirm the judgment.</p>\n<p id=\"b196-4\">In the unpublished portion of our decision, we affirm the convictions and remand the matter with directions to the superior court to modify the abstract of judgment to correct the amount of presentence custody credits. In the published portion of our decision, we conclude the court lacked authority to issue that portion of the protective order barring appellant from having contact with his son and stepdaughter, as they were not \u201cvictim[sj\u201d within the meaning of Penal Code sections 136.2, subdivision (i)(l) and 273.5, subdivision (j).<footnotemark>1</footnotemark> Nor was the postconviction protective order authorized under section 136.2, subdivision (a)(6). Accordingly, on remand, the court is directed to vacate the protective order with respect to them.</p>\n<p id=\"b196-5\">PROCEDURAL HISTORY</p>\n<p id=\"b196-6\">An information charged appellant with corporal injury to a spouse or cohabitant, Mirian Jackeline Baquedano (\u00a7 273.5, subd. (a); count 1), assault by means likely to produce great bodily injury (\u00a7 245, subd. (a)(4); count 2), assault with a deadly weapon (\u00a7 245, subd. (a)(1); count 3), and misdemeanor vandalism (\u00a7 594, subd. (a); count 4). As to count 1, it further alleged that appellant personally used a deadly and dangerous weapon, a rope (\u00a7 12022, subd. (b)(1)). Appellant pled not guilty and denied the allegation.</p>\n<p id=\"b196-7\">Trial was by jury. During voir dire, the trial court made certain remarks to the jury in response to comments by some prospective jurors. The court asked the jurors if they were comfortable with the concept that some victims of violence may be reluctant to assist in prosecuting the person who committed the violent acts, that victims may be reluctant to testify for or against the accused perpetrator, and that they may still have feelings of love and loyalty for the accused. During a recess, defense counsel objected to the court\u2019s remarks, and moved for a mistrial. The court denied the motion.</p>\n<p id=\"b196-8\">The jury found appellant guilty as charged, and found true the deadly weapon allegation as to count 1. The trial court sentenced appellant to a total of five years in prison and one year in county jail. As to count 1, the court imposed the upper term of four years, plus one year for the deadly weapon enhancement (\u00a7 12022, subd. (b)(1)). As to counts 2 and 3, the court imposed the upper term of four years on each count, but stayed the sentences pursuant <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"209\">*209</page-number>to section 654. As to count 4, the court sentenced appellant to one year in county jail, consecutive to the prison sentence. Appellant was awarded 652 days of presentence custody credit, consisting of 326 days of actual custody and 326 days of conduct credit. The court also imposed various fines and assessments.</p>\n<p id=\"b197-5\">Finally, the court issued a criminal protective order as to Baquedano and her two children for the duration of 10 years. Among other provisions, appellant was ordered not to contact the protected parties, except through defense counsel.</p>\n<p id=\"b197-6\">Appellant timely filed a notice of appeal.</p>\n<p id=\"b197-7\">FACTUAL BACKGROUND<footnotemark>*</footnotemark></p>\n<p id=\"b197-8\">DISCUSSION</p>\n<p id=\"b197-9\">Appellant contends (1) the trial court committed misconduct when it made remarks during voir dire that tainted the jury pool; (2) he was denied his fundamental right to confront an adverse witness when the court permitted the prosecutor to present the hearsay statements of Kiarah (appellant\u2019s stepdaughter); and (3) there was insufficient evidence of appellant\u2019s malicious intent to support the vandalism conviction. Appellant further contends the court lacked authority to issue a protective order prohibiting him from having contact with his son Jeffrey and his stepdaughter Kiarah for the next 10 years, except through counsel. The People contend there was no reversible error, but request that this court amend the abstract of judgment to correct appellant\u2019s presentence custody credits.</p>\n<p id=\"b197-10\">A.-C.*</p>\n<p id=\"b197-11\">D. <em>Criminal Protective Order</em></p>\n<p id=\"A0\">1. <em>Relevant Proceedings</em></p>\n<p id=\"b197-12\">At sentencing, the trial court issued a criminal protective order as to Baquedano, Kiarah, and Jeffrey for the duration of 10 years. Among other provisions, appellant was ordered not to contact the protected parties, except through defense counsel.</p>\n<p id=\"b198-3\"><page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"210\">*210</page-number>After the appellate record was filed, counsel filed a written ex parte motion with the trial court to correct the criminal protective order. At the hearing on the motion, appellant argued that the court was not authorized under either section 136.2 or 273.5 to issue the protective order as to Kiarah and Jeffrey because they were not domestic violence victims. The court indicated that its tentative ruling was to allow Kiarah and Jeffrey to remain on the protective order pursuant to section 136.2, subdivision (a)(6). The court found that as to Kiarah, although she was not a direct victim of domestic violence, she was a \u201ccollateral\u201d victim because she witnessed the incident. Additionally, as an \u201cimmediate family member[],\u201d the court believed she qualified under section 136.2, subdivision (a)(6). As to Jeffrey, the court ruled that it might be inclined to lift the protective order as to him if appellant obtained a family court order allowing him contact with Jeffrey. The court denied the motion, but ordered that the protective order be modified to include a reference to section 136.2.</p>\n<p id=\"b198-4\">2. <em>Analysis</em></p>\n<p id=\"b198-5\">The parties agree that the court lacked authority to issue a protective order as to Kiarah and Jeffrey under section 136.2, subdivision (a)(6), as that statutory provision does not authorize postconviction protective orders. (See <em>People </em>v. <em>Selga </em>(2008) 162 Cal.App.4th 113, 118-119 [75 Cal.Rptr.3d 453].) The People argue, however, that the court had authority to issue the protective order under section 136.2, subdivision (i)(l) or 273.5, subdivision (j). Appellant disagrees, arguing that those statutory provisions apply only to \u201cvictims,\u201d and Kiarah and Jeffrey were not victims of the charged offenses.</p>\n<p id=\"b198-6\">\u201cIssues of statutory interpretation are questions of law subject to our independent or de novo review. [Citations.] \u2018The fundamental purpose of statutory construction is to ascertain the intent of the lawmakers so as to effectuate the purpose of the law. [Citations.] In order to determine this intent, we begin by examining the language of the statute. [Citations.] But \u201c[i]t is a settled principle of statutory interpretation that language of a statute should not be given a literal meaning if doing so would result in absurd consequences which the Legislature did not intend.\u201d [Citations.] Thus, \u201c[t]he intent prevails over the letter, and the letter will, if possible, be so read as to conform to the spirit of the act.\u201d [Citation.] Finally, we do not construe statutes in isolation, but rather read every statute \u201cwith reference to the entire scheme of law of which it is part so that the whole may be harmonized and retain effectiveness.\u201d \u2019 [Citation.]\u201d <em>(Babalola </em>v. <em>Superior Court </em>(2011) 192 Cal.App.4th 948, 956 [121 Cal.Rptr.3d 740] [interpreting \u00a7 136.2].)</p>\n<p id=\"b199-4\"><page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"211\">*211</page-number>a. <em>Protective Order Under Section 136.2, Subdivision (i)(l)</em></p>\n<p id=\"b199-5\">Section 136.2, subdivision (i)(l) provides in pertinent part: \u201cIn all cases in which a criminal defendant has been convicted of a crime of domestic violence . . . , the court, at the time of sentencing, shall consider issuing an order restraining the defendant from any contact with the victim. The order may be valid for up to 10 years, as determined by the court. ... It is the intent of the Legislature in enacting this subdivision that the duration of any restraining order issued by the court be based upon the seriousness of the facts before the court, the probability of future violations, and the safety of the victim and his or her immediate family.\u201d As used in the chapter containing section 136.2, subdivision (i)(l), \u201c \u2018[vjictim\u2019 means any natural person with respect to whom there is reason to believe that any crime as defined under the laws of this state ... is being or has been perpetrated or attempted to be perpetrated.\u201d (\u00a7 136, subd. (3).)</p>\n<p id=\"b199-6\">Under the plain language of section 136.2, subdivision (i)(l), a postconviction protective order is limited to restraining the defendant from contact with a \u201cvictim,\u201d that is, a \u201cnatural person with respect to whom there is reason to believe that any crime ... is being or has been perpetrated or attempted to be perpetrated.\u201d (\u00a7 136, subd. (3).) Appellant was convicted of assaulting Baquedano. On the record before the trial court, there was no reason to believe that any crime was being or had been perpetrated or attempted to be perpetrated against Jeffrey or Kiarah. Baquedano testified that appellant \u201cnever touched\u201d the children, and no evidence suggests that appellant ever attempted to harm them. Baquedano thought the children were in another room at the time of the incident, and she never saw Kiarah in the bedroom. Thus, section 136.2, subdivision (i)(l) does not provide statutory authorization for the issuance of a protective order forbidding appellant any contact with Jeffrey or Kiarah.</p>\n<p id=\"b199-7\">Relying on <em>People v. Clayburg </em>(2012) 211 Cal.App.4th 86 [149 Cal.Rptr.3d 414] <em>(Clayburg), </em>the People contend that Jeffrey and Kiarah were \u201cvictims,\u201d as they were members of Baquedano\u2019s immediate family and were harmed by appellant\u2019s actions. The People\u2019s reliance on <em>Clayburg </em>is misplaced for several reasons. First, <em>Clayburg </em>involved a different statute, section 646.9, subdivision (k), although the language in that statute is substantially similar to the language in section 136.2, subdivision (i)(l).</p>\n<p id=\"b199-8\">More importantly, we must disagree with the <em>Clayburg </em>majority\u2019s interpretation of the language in section 646.9, subdivision (k). That statute provides: \u201c \u2018The . . . court. . . shall consider issuing an order restraining the defendant from any contact with the victim, that may be valid for up to 10 years, as determined by the court. [(First sentence.)] It is the intent of the <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"212\">*212</page-number>Legislature that the length of any restraining order be based upon the seriousness of the facts before the court, the probability of future violations, and the safety of the victim and his or her immediate family. [(Second sentence.)]\u2019 \u201d <em>(Clayburg, supra, </em>211 Cal.App.4th at pp. 88-89.) The <em>Clayburg </em>majority held that the second sentence modified the first sentence, and expanded the meaning of \u201cvictim\u201d in the first sentence to include \u201ca member of the immediate family of a stalking victim . . . who suffers emotional harm.\u201d <em>(Id. </em>at p. 88, citation omitted.) We read the second sentence to mean what it says: the court should consider, among other factors, the \u201csafety of the victim and his or her immediate family\u201d in determining the length of the restraining order authorized in the first sentence. Nothing suggests the second sentence also modifies the scope of the restraining order. As noted by Justice Perren in the <em>Clayburg </em>dissent, if the term \u201cvictim\u201d in the first sentence included a child of the family, the second sentence would have no need to refer to \u201c \u2018the victim and his or her immediate family.\u2019 \u201d <em>(Id. </em>at pp. 94-95 (dis. opn. of Perren, J.).)</p>\n<p id=\"b200-4\">For similar reasons, we conclude in the instant case that the statutory language in section 136.2, subdivision (i)(l) providing that \u201cthe duration of any restraining order issued by the court be based upon ... the safety of the victim and his or her immediate family\u201d does not modify the term \u201cvictim\u201d in the first sentence. Thus, any restraining order issued under this provision must be limited to prohibiting contact with the victim.</p>\n<p id=\"b200-5\">Finally, <em>Clayburg </em>is factually distinguishable. There, the evidence established that the defendant stalked the named victim and the victim\u2019s child, causing both to suffer emotional harm. On those facts, a protective order could have been issued covering the child under section 136.2, subdivision (i)(l), as the child was a \u201cnatural person with respect to whom there is reason to believe that any crime as defined under the laws of this state ... is being or has been perpetrated or attempted to be perpetrated.\u201d (\u00a7 136, subd. (3).) In contrast, here, no evidence suggests Jeffrey and Kiarah were similarly targeted or harmed.</p>\n<p id=\"b200-6\">In sum, absent evidence from which the trial court could reasonably conclude that appellant had harmed or attempted to harm Jeffrey or Kiarah, the court lacked authority to issue the no-contact protective order as to the children under section 136.2, subdivision (i)(l).</p>\n<p id=\"b200-7\">b. <em>Protective Order Under Section 273.5, Subdivision (j)</em></p>\n<p id=\"b200-8\">Section 273.5, subdivision (j) contains language similar to section 136.2, subdivision (i)(l). It provides: \u201cUpon conviction under subdivision (a) [for willful infliction of a corporal injury upon a victim], the sentencing court <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"213\">*213</page-number>shall also consider issuing an order restraining the defendant from any contact with the victim, which may be valid for up to 10 years, as determined by the court. It is the intent of the Legislature that the length of any restraining order be based upon the seriousness of the facts before the court, the probability of future violations, and the safety of the victim and his or her immediate family.\u201d (\u00a7 273.5, subd. (j).) Section 273.5, subdivision (b) provides that section 273.5, subdivision (a) applies if the victim is or was one or more of the following: (1) the offender\u2019s spouse or former spouse, (2) the offender\u2019s cohabitant or former cohabitant, (3) the offender\u2019s fianc\u00e9e, or (4) the mother or father of the offender\u2019s child. (\u00a7 273.5, subd. (b).)</p>\n<p id=\"b201-5\">Under the plain language of section 273.5, the court lacked authority to issue a protective order as to Jeffrey and Kiarah. First, Jeffrey and Kiarah are not victims under section 273.5, subdivision (j). Baquedano confirmed that appellant never used physical force against them (see <em>People </em>v. <em>Johnson </em>(2007) 150 Cal.App.4th 1467, 1477 [59 Cal.Rptr.3d 405] [a violation of \u00a7 273.5 occurs only where a direct application of force on the victim results in corporal injury]). Second, for the reasons stated above, the second sentence of section 273.5, subdivision (j)\u2014addressing the length of the restraining order\u2014does not modify the term \u201cvictim\u201d in the first sentence or expand it to include the children. Our interpretation is bolstered by the fact that the children do not fall within one or more of the categories of victims listed in section 273.5, subdivision (b). That statutory section limits the applicability of section 273.5, subdivision (a) to certain victims (spouses, cohabitants, fianc\u00e9es, or parents of the offender\u2019s child), and correspondingly limits the scope of the restraining order authorized by section 273.5, subdivision (j). Thus, section 273.5, subdivision (j) does not authorize the court to issue a protective order as to Jeffrey and Kiarah.</p>\n<p id=\"b201-6\">In short, neither section 136.2, subdivision (i)(l), nor section 273.5, subdivision (j) provides legal authority for the issuance of a protective order forbidding appellant from any contact with Jeffrey or Kiarah. Accordingly, the protective order must be modified to remove their names.</p>\n<p id=\"b201-7\">E. <em>Presentence Custody </em>Credits<footnotemark>*</footnotemark></p>\n<p id=\"b201-8\">DISPOSITION</p>\n<p id=\"b201-9\">The convictions are affirmed, and the matter is remanded with directions to the superior court to modify the abstract of judgment to correct the amount of <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"214\">*214</page-number>presentence custody credits, and to modify the protective order to remove Jeffrey and Kiarah. As modified, the judgment is affirmed.</p>\n<p id=\"b202-4\">Epstein, P. J., and Willhite, J., concurred.</p>\n<p id=\"b202-5\">Appellant\u2019s petition for review by the Supreme Court was denied September 24, 2014, S220276.</p>\n<footnote label=\"1\">\n<p id=\"b196-9\"> All further statutory citations are to the Penal Code, unless otherwise stated.</p>\n</footnote>\n<footnote label=\"*\">\n<p id=\"b197-13\">See footnote, <em>ante, </em>page 205.</p>\n</footnote>\n<footnote label=\"*\">\n<p id=\"b201-10\">See footnote, <em>ante, </em>page 205.</p>\n</footnote>\n</opinion>\n</casebody>\n",
