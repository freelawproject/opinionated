Such an appeal, while pending, stays the hands of the state and of the state authorities. (U. S. Rev. Stats., secs. 763-66; <em>In re Jugiro, </em>140 U. S. 291.)</p>\n<p id=\"b92-4\"><page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"56\">*56</page-number>Against the evidence thus offered no counter-showing whatever was made. It thus having been established that the appeal is pending, it will be presumed to be still pending until the presumption is legally overcome. (Code Civ. Proc., sec. 1963, subd. 32.) Therefore, so far as the record now before us discloses, the defendant was subjected to proceedings in a matter involving a federal question which was <em>sub judice </em>before the supreme court of the United States. Such proceedings are null and void. (U. S. Rev. Stats., sec. 766.)</p>\n<p id=\"b92-5\">The question here presented differs from that considered in the Jugiro case, <em>supra. </em>In the latter case Jugiro\u2019s appeal from an order of the circuit court denjdng his application for a writ of <em>habeas corpus </em>had been decided adversely to him upon November 24, 1890. Upon December 1, 1890, the mandate of the supreme court not having been issued, he was brought before the court of oyer and terminer in New York, and there by order a day was fixed for his execution. Upon a second appeal under <em>habeas corpus </em>proceedings, the contention was made before the supreme court of the United States that this order of the court of oyer and terminer was absolutely void. The supreme court of the United States, stating that it took judicial knowledge of its own decisions, and that therefore itself knew that the former decision had become final, declared that, while \u201cit would have been more appropriate and orderly if the state court had deferred final action until our mandate was issued and filed,\u201d it did not \u201cfeel authorized to say that the order of the New York court was absolutely void.\u201d</p>\n<p id=\"b92-6\">In the present case the question is not, What judicial knowledge has the supreme court of the United States of its own decisions? but it is, What legal evidence was adduced before the judge of the superior court to justify him in pronouncing the order in question after a showing by appellant that his appeal staying the hands of the state authorities was still pending? If he had no evidence warranting his act (and none appears in the record presented), then the order is certainly erroneous, and as such reversible upon this appeal; while in the Jugiro case mere matters of error could not be and were not considered.</p>\n<p id=\"b92-7\">There is yet another and independent consideration calling for the issuance of the certificate. The order here under con<page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"57\">*57</page-number>sideration is an order made after final judgment. From such an order an appeal to this court lies. (Pen. Code, sec. 1237.) From the date of the making of the order the appellant is guaranteed by the law ten days in which to prepare and present his bill of exceptions. (Pen. Code, sec. 1174.) It is not for one moment to be contemplated that this right, so secured to a defendant, may be cut down and destroyed by an ord\u00e9r of court fixing the date of execution of a defendant within this period. Under the law of this state it is a violation of a defendant\u2019s rights and a gross abuse of discretion so to shorten the time.</p>\n<p id=\"b93-5\">For these reasons a certificate of probable cause will issue.</p>\n<p id=\"b93-6\">Temple, J., Van Fleet, J., Harrison, J., Beatty, C.
