The contention of appellant is, that the calls of the description in the resolution of intention do not include any district or piece of land whatsoever\u2014that they do not close at the initial point. It is clear that the diagram prepared by the official surveyor and attached to the assessment does show <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"26\">*26</page-number>l,he exterior boundaries of the alleged assessment district, and includes a definite piece of land; but it is contended that the surveyor could not properly produce the diagram from the description in the resolution of intention. We do not think, however, that this contention can be maintained.</p>\n<p id=\"b62-5\">In construing a description, monuments and fixed points control courses, distances, and angles. In the case at bar, there is no question as to the initial point; it is \u201ca point on the east side of Kentucky street one hundred and five (105) feet northerly from the northeaserly corner of Kentucky street and Second avenue south.\u201d The first course is \u201cthence running southeasterly and parallel with Second avenue south four hundred (400) feet,\u201d and there is no dispute as to this course. The second course is \u201cthence at right angles southwesterly and parallel with Railroad avenue to the center line of Eighteenth avenue south.\u201d This line, if run at right angles with the first course, would not be parallel with Railroad avenue; if run parallel with said avenue it makes an angle with the first course somewhat greater than a right angle. But here the monument is the street\u2014Railroad avenue; and the surveyor properly run the line southwesterly and parallel with the street, rejecting the term \u201cat right angles\u201d as controlled by the monument. The same thing was done with respect to the third course, which is \u201cthence at right angles northwesterly and parallel with Eighteenth avenue south eight hundred and eighty (SSO) feet\u201d; the line was run parallel with the avenue, although the angle thus made with the previous course was somewhat less than a right angle. The fourth course is: \u201cthence at right angles northeasterly and parallel with Railroad avenue,\u201d to a definitely fixed point, to wit: \u201cto a point four hundred (400) feet northwesterly from the westerly line of Kentucky street and one hundred and five (105) feet northeasterly from the northeasterly line of Second avenue south.\u201d This line, in order to reach the said fixed point, varies a very little from an exact parallel with Railroad avenue; but here the fixed point controls the other calls, and the surveyor properly ran from the end of the previous course in a direct line to the said fixed point. The fifth and last course is: \u201cthence at right angles southeasterly and parallel with Second avenue south to the point of com<page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"27\">*27</page-number>mencement.'\"\u2019 A line from the said fixed point at the end of the fourth course to the point of commencement is very slightly out of parallel with Second avenue; but the same rule which we have applied to the fourth course applies here, and the surveyor properly ran the line straight from the one fixed point to the other.</p>\n<p id=\"b63-5\">The judgment and order appealed from are affirmed.</p>\n<p id=\"b63-6\">Henshaw, J., and Temple, J. concurred.</p>\n<p id=\"b63-7\">Hearing in Bank denied.</p>\n</opinion>\n</casebody>\n",
