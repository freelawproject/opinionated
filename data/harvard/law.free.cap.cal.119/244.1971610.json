Accompanying the note rvas an agreement executed by the patties of which the following is a copy:</p>\n<blockquote id=\"b281-5\">\u201cAgreement.</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b281-6\">\u201cThis agreement, made by and between H. B. Havens and A. G. Platt, both of San Francisco, Cal., witnesseth:</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b281-7\">\u201cThat the said H. B. Havens hereby sells to said A. G.

The balance, six thousand two hundred and fifty shares of stock, Avill be placed in escroAV with Mr. A. IC.

PLATT.</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b282-9\">\u201cWitness:</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b282-10\">\u201c(Signed) A. K. Durbrow.</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b282-11\">\u201cWitness to signature of A. G. Platt:</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b282-12\">\u201c(Signed) J. B. Palmer.</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b282-13\">\u201cThat on the margin of said agreement, opposite the clause referring to said promissory note, was a further stipulation between plaintiff and defendant made at the same time, in words as follows:</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b282-14\">\u201c \u2018This note is not to be transferred or used without maker\u2019s permission, but is to be canceled upon the canceling of this agreement or payment of amount named.</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b282-15\">\u201c\u2018(Signed) H. B. HAVENS.</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b282-16\">\u201c \u2018(Signed) A. G. PLATT.\u2019 \u201d</blockquote>\n<p id=\"b282-17\">The first point made by appellant for reversal was that the cause of action was one at law, and that the court below erred in denying to defendant a jury trial. The facts bearing on the question are as follows:</p>\n<blockquote id=\"b282-18\">The cause was pending in Department 4 of the superior court. On the twentieth day of December, 1895, the attorneys for the respective parties stipulated as follows: \u201cIt is hereby stipulated between the parties to the above-entitled action that said action may be set down for trial at such time as will suit the convenience of the court on any day after the 15th of January, 1896.\u201d</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b282-19\">The action was set for trial March 3, 1896, and not being reached was reset for March 13, 1896.</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b283-4\"><page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"247\">*247</page-number>Again, it was apparent that the cause would not be reached, and the attorneys for the respective parties met the judge of the court at his chambers to arrange a future day for trial, and then and there counsel for defendant announced that he had not waived a jury trial, and insisted upon his right to a trial by jury. The judge then postponed the trial for one week, and directed counsel \u201cto make his demand for a jury trial in open court.\u201d</blockquote>\n<p id=\"b283-5\">Thereupon, and in open court, on March 13, 1896, such demand for a jury trial was made. The court, on the 16th of the same month, denied the application for a jury trial, \u201con the ground that the action was one in which the parties were not entitled to a jury trial.\u201d Defendant excepted.</p>\n<p id=\"b283-6\">It may be stated, also, that Department 4 of the superior court was and for two years had been engaged in the trial of court cases, and had not during that period had a jury in attendance, and that the regulation to this effect was notorious.</p>\n<p id=\"b283-7\">The action, is to all intents and purposes one at law to recover money upon a promissory note, and for the breach of the contract entered into simultaneously therewith.</p>\n<p id=\"b283-8\">Plaintiff averred that he had complied with all the conditions to he by him kept and performed, but that defendant had violated the contract, etc. The contention of the respondent that plaintiff might have enforced a lien upon the stock mentioned in the agreement cannot be upheld, for the reason that there are no facts stated in the complaint going to uphold any such lien, but, on the contrary, the whole theory of the complaint is, that plaintiff rescinded the agreement, as he had a right to do, by tendering a return of the stock and demanding payment of the note, and he offers to return the stock to defendant, to surrender it in court, etc.</p>\n<p id=\"b283-9\">There was no case that could be made consistent with the issues that would entitle plaintiff to equitable relief.</p>\n<p id=\"b283-10\">We think, therefore, that the court erred in holding, as it did, that the cause was one in which the parties were not entitled to a jury trial.</p>\n<p id=\"b283-11\">. Despondent contends, however, that if it be conceded that the court was wrong in the reason which it gave for refusing a jury to defendant, it was still right in its conclusion, because defendant had by the stipulation in effect waived a jury. Trial by jury <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"248\">*248</page-number>may be waived: \u201c1. By failing to appear at the trial; <em>2. </em>By written consent .... filed with the clerk;- 3. By oral consent, in open court, entered in the minutes.\u201d (Code Civ. Proc., sec. 631.)</p>\n<p id=\"b284-5\">The stipulation of the attorneys was entirely consistent with the idea of a trial either with a jury or by the court. It is only by ingrafting therein the, fact that there was no jury for that department of the court, and that such fact was notorious, that the stipulation becomes of any force.</p>\n<p id=\"b284-6\">We think this too vague and uncertain a basis upon which, in the face of our code, to found a waiver. It was held in an early case <em>(Smith v. Polack, </em>2 Cal. 92) that the right of trial by jury cannot be waived by implication.</p>\n<p id=\"b284-7\">In <em>Swasey </em>v. <em>Adair, </em>88 Cal. 179, it was held that a jury trial can only be waived in one of the modes prescribed in section 631, <em>supra.</em></p>\n<p id=\"b284-8\">In <em>Biggs v. Lloyd, </em>70 Cal. 447, it was held that the right to a jury trial is not waived by neglecting to demand a jury at the time the case is called to be set for trial, notwithstanding a rule of court that a jury shall then be demanded.</p>\n<p id=\"b284-9\">- For the reasons given in these cases, we think there was no waiver of a jury in the manner prescribed by law, and that the Court below erred in its ruling.</p>\n<p id=\"b284-10\">We recommend that the judgment be reversed and the cause remanded.</p>\n<p id=\"b284-11\">Haynes, C., and Belcher, C., concurred.</p>\n<p id=\"b284-12\">For the reasons given in the foregoing opinion the judgment is reversed and the cause remanded.</p>\n<p id=\"b284-13\">McFarland, J., Temple, J., Henshaw, J.</p>\n<p id=\"b284-14\">Hearing in Bank denied.</p>\n</opinion>\n</casebody>\n",
