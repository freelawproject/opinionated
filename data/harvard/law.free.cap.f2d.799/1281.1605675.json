We conclude that it does not. Winston Lewy, a Southern Pacific Transportation Company employee, was injured in a collision in'the company\u2019s Los Angeles switching yard, and subsequently was discharged by Southern Pacific for other reasons. Lewy brought an FELA action against Southern Pacific to recover for the injuries he sustained in the collision and for the aggravation of those injuries resulting from his discharge. He appeals a jury award of $15,000.</p>\n<p id=\"b1359-18\">Lewy challenges the trial court\u2019s exclusion of all evidence relating to his discharge by Southern Pacific. He also claims that the trial court erroneously excluded evidence concerning the bias of one of Southern Pacific\u2019s witnesses and claims that its jury instructions were repetitive and slanted against him. We have jurisdiction under 28 U.S.C. \u00a7 1291 (1982). We conclude that the Railway Labor Act (RLA), 45 U.S.C. \u00a7\u00a7 151-188 (1982), precludes courts from awarding the type of discharge-related damages sought by Lewy, and find his other challenges to be without merit. We therefore affirm.</p>\n<p id=\"b1359-19\">FACTUAL BACKGROUND</p>\n<p id=\"b1359-20\">Lewy was injured in March, 1980 when a locomotive he was operating was struck from the rear by a locomotive operated by another Southern Pacific employee. Following the collision, he experienced pain in his head, neck, lower back, and right leg, and was hospitalized for eight days. His back condition appeared to deteriorate over the next year, and he underwent a lumbar laminectomy to remove a portion of his spinal disc tissue in April, 1981. Lewy was hospitalized for two weeks following the surgery. His total medical bills resulting from the accident were $12,665.37.</p>\n<p id=\"b1359-21\">In August, 1980, when Lewy was convalescing from his original injury, Southern Pacific began to suspect that he was malingering, and ordered him to undergo a physical examination with a company phy<page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"1284\">*1284</page-number>sician. Lewy refused, and Southern Pacific charged him with insubordination and misrepresenting his physical condition, convened a disciplinary hearing, and discharged him in October, 1980. Lewy appealed his dismissal to the National Railroad Adjustment Board (NRAB). In December, 1981, the NRAB ruled that Southern Pacific had introduced irrelevant evidence at Lewy\u2019s disciplinary hearing, and had improperly refused to permit two of his treating physicians to testify. The NRAB ordered Lewy to be reinstated based on these procedural errors, expressly noting that it was not ruling on the merits of his claim:</p>\n<blockquote id=\"b1360-4\">[Irrespective of what we might think of the merits or of the Claimant\u2019s [Lewy\u2019s] testimony, we do not pass thereon. Claimant will be reinstated to service with all rights unimpaired, but without pay for time lost as Claimant has yet to be discharged from [his current treating physician\u2019s] care.</blockquote>\n<p id=\"b1360-5\">Lewy\u2019s physician gave him permission to return to work in February 1982, but advised that he should avoid prolonged sitting. As a result, Lewy was prevented from returning to his former position as an engineer, and was limited instead to yard service, a lower-paying job. Before returning to work, however, Lewy was required to pass Southern Pacific\u2019s standard rules examination, and he failed it a number of times. He returned to work in September, 1982.</p>\n<p id=\"b1360-6\">At trial, Southern Pacific introduced evidence that the collision in which Lewy was injured was not very severe, that Lewy had a history of back problems prior to the collision, and that Lewy may have been malingering. The engineer operating the other locomotive in the collision testified that the two trains \u201cdidn\u2019t hit that hard,\u201d and that the collision \u201cwas just like coupling into a car.\u201d Moreover, Southern Pacific elicited testimony that Lewy had injured his back in a 1964 automobile accident, and that that injury left him unable to play tennis, which he had regularly done up to that time, and resulted in his being excused from military service. Lewy attempted in his testimony to minimize the severity of his prior back injury, but he was impeached based upon answers to interrogatories he had provided in his personal injury action arising out of the 1964 accident. His sister, Jere Brown, testified that he had consulted her following the 1964 accident concerning whether he should have back surgery, and had specifically told her that he no longer played tennis and could not serve in the military because of his injury. Furthermore, two of Lewy\u2019s treating physicians testified tlrat they doubted his veracity concerning his description of his physical condition and suspected him of malingering.</p>\n<p id=\"b1360-8\">Lewy sought $117,400 in lost wages and benefits, $236,400 in lost future wages and benefits, and $12,665.37 in medical expenses he had incurred. The jury deliberated for two hours, found for Lewy, but awarded him only $15,000. Lewy contends that the jury\u2019s low verdict was attributable to three errors by the trial court: (1) its exclusion of evidence relating to his discharge; (2) its exclusion of evidence demonstrating his sister\u2019s bias against him; and (3) its slanted jury instructions, which, he claims, overemphasized the possibility that he was contributorily negligent for the collision.</p>\n<p id=\"b1360-9\">\n<em>A. Exclusion of Evidence Relating to Lewy\u2019s Discharge</em>\n</p>\n<p id=\"b1360-10\">At trial, Lewy testified that following his accident, he developed a fear and anxiety that he would be unable to work and would remain unemployed. He sought to introduce testimony that his \u201cwrongful discharge\u201d by Southern Pacific aggravated this anxiety and emotional anguish, and claimed he was entitled to recover damages for this aggravation of his preexisting emotional condition, based upon the Second Circuit\u2019s decision in <em>Sharkey v. Penn Central Transportation Co., </em>493 F.2d 685 (2d Cir.1974), which authorized the award of such damages. Southern Pacific filed a pretrial motion to preclude Lewy from introducing any evidence or testimony regarding his <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"1285\">*1285</page-number>discharge, reinstatement, or resulting damages, maintaining that any claims relating to Lewy\u2019s discharge had to be brought under the grievance and arbitral procedures established by the RLA, and therefore, evidence concerning Lewy\u2019s discharge would be irrelevant in his FELA action.</p>\n<p id=\"b1361-5\">The original district judge in this action denied Southern Pacific\u2019s motion, and ruled, based upon <em>Sharkey, </em>that although the NRAB had \u201cexclusive jurisdiction\u201d to \u201cdetermine whether [Lewy\u2019s] discharge was proper,\u201d it had already determined that Lewy was wrongfully discharged, albeit for purely procedural reasons. The judge concluded, therefore, that Lewy was entitled to recover damages under the FELA \u201cfor aggravation of [his preexisting emotional] condition due to [the] improper discharge.\u201d</p>\n<p id=\"b1361-6\">A different judge presided at trial. Although he felt compelled to follow this pretrial ruling, he expressed serious doubts about applying Sharkey\u2019s principles in Lewy\u2019s action. The trial judge noted the extremely complex, almost metaphysical proximate-cause analysis that the jury would be required to undertake under <em>Sharkey: </em>they would be required, in effect, to distinguish between the \u201cnew\u201d emotional distress caused exclusively by Lewy\u2019s discharge, for which they <em>could not </em>award damages, and the \u201caggravation\u201d of Lewy\u2019s preexisting emotional distress and anxiety, for which they <em>could </em>award damages. Moreover, the trial judge noted that under <em>Sharkey, </em>before awarding any discharge-related damages, the jury would also be required to determine whether or not Lewy had \u201ccaused\u201d his own discharge by refusing to see Southern Pacific\u2019s company physician.</p>\n<p id=\"b1361-7\">The trial judge ultimately determined that allowing Lewy to advance his aggravation theory would result in \u201cundue delay\u201d and a \u201cconfusion of the issues.\u201d He therefore excluded evidence relating to Lewy\u2019s discharge under Federal Rule of Evidence 403, and ruled that Lewy could present evidence relating to his emotional distress \u201cattributable only to the accident\u201d itself, Lewy challenges this ruling as an abuse of discretion.<footnotemark>1</footnotemark></p>\n<p id=\"b1361-9\">\n<em>B. Exclusion of Evidence Relating to Jere Brown\u2019s Bias</em>\n</p>\n<p id=\"b1361-10\">Jere Brown\u2019s testimony concerning the severity of Lewy\u2019s 1964 back injury was damaging to Lewy\u2019s case. Lewy attempted to impeach Brown by demonstrating that she was biased against him, because he had had her removed as executrix of their father\u2019s estate in 1977, supposedly for embezzlement. Lewy\u2019s counsel cross-examined Brown extensively about her removal as executrix and the embezzlement charges against her, and even raised the possibility that Brown had contacted Southern Pacific herself and volunteered to testify against Lewy. Lewy testified that there was \u201cbad blood\u201d between him and his sister, that she was \u201cremoved as executrix\u201d of their father\u2019s estate \u201cbecause of her inability to handle th[e] estate,\u201d and that he was \u201cput in as executor, to investigate her dealings,\u201d which \u201ccaused a flare-up in [their] relationship.\u201d</p>\n<p id=\"b1361-11\">The trial judge excluded certain testimony under Rule 403 on the \u201cside issue[s]\u201d of whether Brown actually embezzled funds from the estate and whether her share of the estate was ultimately withheld from her. Lewy maintains that the exclusion of this evidence prevented him from effectively establishing Brown\u2019s bias and lack of credibility, and therefore constituted an abuse of discretion.</p>\n<p id=\"b1361-12\">\n<em>C. The Trial Court\u2019s Jury Instructions</em>\n</p>\n<p id=\"b1361-13\">In its jury instructions, the trial court explained the principles of negligence, causation, and contributory negligence, and in-<page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"1286\">*1286</page-number>eluded one final instruction defining causation:</p>\n<blockquote id=\"b1362-4\">An injury is caused by an act or omission whenever it appears that the act or omission played any part, no matter how small, in actually bringing about or causing that injury. So if you find from the evidence that any negligence on the part of any party contributed in any way or manner toward any claimed injury or damages, you will find that injury was caused by such act or omission.</blockquote>\n<p id=\"b1362-5\">Lewy objected to this instruction at trial, and now challenges it on appeal, claiming that it was repetitive and that because it directly followed an instruction on contributory negligence,<footnotemark>2</footnotemark> it \u201cunduly emphasize[d]\u201d Southern Pacific\u2019s contention that he was contributorily negligent and that any judgment in his favor should consequently be reduced. Nevertheless, as can be seen, the instruction does not contain the words \u201cplaintiff\u201d or \u201cLewy,\u201d but instead refers merely to the negligence of \u201cany party.\u201d</p>\n<p id=\"b1362-6\">ANALYSIS</p>\n<p id=\"b1362-7\">We conclude as a threshold matter that the RLA precludes courts from awarding the type of discharge-related damages sought by Lewy in FELA actions. As a result, the evidence relating to Lewy\u2019s discharge that he sought to introduce at trial was not relevant to his FELA claims, and should have been excluded under Federal Rule of Evidence 402. <em>See </em>Fed.R.Evid. 402 (\u201c[e]vidence which is not relevant is not admissible\u201d). Since we may affirm the trial court\u2019s decision on any ground supported by the record,<footnotemark>3</footnotemark> <em>Lofton v. Heckler, </em>781 F.2d 1390, 1392 (9th Cir.1986); <em>accord Smith v. Block, </em>784 F.2d 993, 996 n. 4 (9th Cir.1986); <em>Bloom v. General Truck Drivers, Office, Food &amp; Warehouse Union, Local 952, </em>783 F.2d 1356, 1363 n. 16 (9th Cir.1986), we need not address the merits of the trial court\u2019s ruling excluding this evidence under Rule 403.<footnotemark>4</footnotemark> We also conclude that Lewy\u2019s remaining challenges to the trial court\u2019s judgment are without merit.</p>\n<p id=\"b1362-12\">\n<em>A. Standard of Review</em>\n</p>\n<p id=\"b1362-13\">We examine de novo any questions relating to the district court\u2019s subject-matter jurisdiction under the FELA, or relating to statutory interpretation of the FELA and RLA. <em>See Davy v. SEC, </em>792 F.2d 1418, 1421 (9th Cir.1986) (statutory interpretation); <em>Pro Sales, Inc. v. Texaco, </em><page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"1287\">*1287</page-number><em>U.S.A., </em>792 F.2d 1394, 1396 (9th Cir.1986) (subject-matter jurisdiction); <em>Jones v. Gordon, </em>792 F.2d 821, 824 (9th Cir.1986) (subject-matter jurisdiction); <em>Semar v. Platte Valley Federal Savings &amp; Loan Association, </em>791 F.2d 699, 703 (9th Cir.1986) (statutory interpretation).</p>\n<p id=\"b1363-5\">We review the trial court\u2019s rulings under Federal Rule of Evidence 403 for abuse of discretion. <em>See Maddox v. City of Los Angeles, </em>792 F.2d 1408, 1412 (9th Cir.1986); <em>United States v. Feldman, </em>788 F.2d 544, 557 (9th Cir.1986). Finally, in addressing Lewy\u2019s challenge to the trial court\u2019s jury instructions, we review the instructions as a whole, in the context of the entire trial, to determine whether they were \u201c \u2018misleading or ... inadequate to guide the jury\u2019s deliberations.\u2019 \u201d <em>United States v. Shortt Accountancy Corp., </em>785 F.2d 1448, 1454 (9th Cir.1986), <em>cert. denied, </em>\u2014 U.S. -, 106 S.Ct. 3301, 92 L.Ed.2d 715 (1986); <em>accord Maddox, </em>792 F.2d at 1412; <em>Los Angeles Memorial Coliseum Commission v. National Football League, </em>791 F.2d 1356, 1360 (9th Cir.1986); <em>see Carvalho v. Raybestos-Manhattan, Inc., </em>794 F.2d 454, 455-56 (9th Cir.1986). We may reverse only for an abuse of discretion, and must give the trial judge \u201csubstantial latitude in tailoring the instructions so long as they fairly and adequately cover the issues presented.\u201d <em>United States v. Benny, </em>786 F.2d 1410, 1416 (9th Cir.1986); <em>accord Carvalho, </em>794 F.2d 455-56; <em>Los Angeles Memorial Coliseum, </em>791 F.2d at 1360.</p>\n<p id=\"b1363-8\">\n<em>B. Exclusion of Evidence Relating to Lewy\u2019s Discharge</em>\n</p>\n<p id=\"b1363-9\">In reviewing the trial court\u2019s decision to exclude Lewy\u2019s evidence relating to his discharge, we must examine the relative scope and purposes of the FELA and RLA, and must determine the extent to which the FELA authorizes parties to recover damages for discharge-related injuries, and the extent to which the RLA precludes courts from addressing such claims. The parties do not dispute that Lewy was entitled to recover damages under the FELA for the emotional distress and anxiety he suffered as a direct result of the March, 1980 collision. <em>See generally Taylor v. Burlington Northern Railroad Co., </em>787 F.2d 1309, 1313 (9th Cir.1986). Nor do they dispute that he cannot recover damages in court for his emotional distress and financial losses attributable exclusively to his October, 1980 discharge. <em>See Crusos v. United Transportation Union, Local 1201, </em>786 F.2d 970, 972 (9th Cir.1986); <em>Buell v. Atchison, Topeka and Santa Fe Railway Co., </em>771 F.2d 1320, 1323 (9th Cir.1985), ce<em>rt. granted, </em>\u2014 U.S. -, 106 S.Ct. 1946, 90 L.Ed.2d 356 (1986). The parties\u2019 dispute in this appeal concerns only whether Lewy can recover damages under the FELA for the aggravation, resulting from his discharge, of the emotional condition and anxiety he originally developed because of the collision. We conclude that such claims are not cognizable under the FELA, and therefore, evidence relating to Lewy\u2019s discharge was not relevant in the present action, and was properly excluded by the trial court. <em>See </em>Fed.R.Evid. 402.</p>\n<p id=\"b1363-13\">\n<em>1. Scope of the FELA\u2019s Coverage</em>\n</p>\n<p id=\"b1363-14\">The FELA was originally enacted by Congress in 1906 in order to \u201ccreate[ ] a tort remedy for railroad workers injured on the job.\u201d <em>Lancaster v. Norfolk and Western Railway Co., </em>773 F.2d 807, 812 (7th Cir.1985); <em>see Yawn v. Southern Railway Co., </em>591 F.2d 312, 317 (5th Cir.), <em>cert. denied, </em>442 U.S. 934, 99 S.Ct. 2869, 61 L.Ed.2d 304 (1979). The statute\u2019s main purpose was to enable injured railroad workers to overcome a number of traditional defenses to tort liability that had previously operated to bar their actions, including contributory negligence, contractual waiver of liability, the fellow-servant rule, and assumption of the risk. <em>See Lancaster, </em>773 F.2d at 813; 45 U.S.C. \u00a7\u00a7 51, 53-55; H.R.Rep.

It was passed in \u201cresponse to the special needs of railroad workers,\u201d <em>Sinkler v. Missouri Pacific </em><page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"1288\">*1288</page-number><em>Railroad Co., </em>356 U.S. 326, 329, 78 S.Ct. 758, 762, 2 L.Ed.2d 799 (1958), and must \u201cbe construed liberally for [their] protection.\u201d <em>Fox v.

Chesapeake and Ohio Railway Co., </em>580 F.2d 713, 714 (4th Cir.1978). As the Supreme Court has stated,</p>\n<blockquote id=\"A6bh\">restriction[s] as to the kinds of employees covered, the degree of negligence required, or the particular sorts of harms inflicted, would be contradictory to the wording, the remedial and humanitarian purpose, and the constant and established course of liberal construction of the Act followed by this Court.</blockquote>\n<p id=\"b1364-4\"><em>Urie v.

We have recently interpreted FELA section 1 to cover a railroad employee\u2019s \u201cwholly mental injury,\u201d specifically an emotional breakdown, that resulted from his supervisor\u2019s and co-workers\u2019 \u201charassment, threats, and intimidation [which] he suffered while employed.\u201d <em>Buell, </em>771 F.2d at 1321, 1324;<footnotemark>6</footnotemark> <em>accord Taylor, </em>787 F.2d at 1313; <em>but see Lancaster, </em>773 F.2d at 813, 815 (\u201c[T]he FELA does not create a cause of action for tortious harms brought about by acts that lack any physical contact or threat of physical contact.\u201d).</p>\n<p id=\"b1364-9\">Yet regardless of how broadly courts have interpreted the scope of the FELA <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"1289\">*1289</page-number>section 1, they have, with one exception,<footnotemark>7</footnotemark> authorized the award of damages under the provision only for injuries sustained by workers \u201con the job\u201d and in the general course of their work-related duties. <em>See, eg., Taylor, 787 </em>F.2d at 1313-16; <em>Buell, 771 </em>F.2d at 1321-24; <em>Lancaster, 778 </em>F.2d at 812-16; <em>Yawn, </em>591 F.2d at 314-17; <em>see also McSorley v.

Courts have not treated injuries resulting from allegedly wrongful discharges and other labor law violations as \u201con the job\u201d injuries in this context, and therefore, with the single exception noted above, they have not authorized the award of damages under FELA section 1 for such injuries. <em>See generally Crasos, </em>786 F.2d at 971-72 (holding that there is no basis for federal subject-matter jurisdiction over wrongful discharge claim against railroad).</p>\n<p id=\"b1365-5\">\n<em>2. Scope of the RLA\u2019s Coverage</em>\n</p>\n<p id=\"A8H\">Congress enacted the RLA in 1926 in order to promote stability in the railroad industry and to provide for prompt and efficient resolution of labor-management disputes arising out of railroad collective bargaining agreements. <em>See Union Pacific Railroad Co. v. Sheehan, </em>439 U.S. 89, 94, 99 S.Ct. 399, 402, 58 L.Ed.2d 354 (1978) (per curiam). Whereas the FELA is \u201ca statutory mechanism designed [by Congress] to give railroad employees a federal right to sue [their employers],\u201d <em>Fox, </em>739 F.2d at 931, and therefore guarantees them access to the courts, Congress specifically intended in the RLA to keep railroad labor disputes <em>out of the courts </em>and instead requires the use of grievance procedures and arbitration:</p>\n<blockquote id=\"b1365-6\">In enacting [the RLA], Congress endeavored to promote stability in labor-management relations in this important national industry by providing effective and efficient remedies for the resolution of railroad-employee disputes arising out of the interpretation of collective-bargaining agreements. The NRAB was created as a tribunal consisting of workers and management to secure the <em>prompt, orderly and final settlement of grievances </em>that arise daily between employees and carriers regarding <em>rates of pay, rules and working conditions. Congress considered it essential to keep these so-called \u201cminor\u201d disputes within the NRAB and out of the courts.</em></blockquote>\n<p id=\"b1365-9\"><em>Sheehan, </em>439 U.S. at 94, 99 S.Ct. at 402 (citations omitted and emphasis added).</p>\n<p id=\"b1365-10\">Thus, RLA section 3 First (i), 45 U.S.C. \u00a7 153 First (i), provides that all \u201cdisputes between [railroad] employees and ... carriers growing out of grievances or out of the interpretation or application of agreements concerning rates of pay, rules, or working conditions\u201d \u2014 so-called \u201cminor disputes\u201d\u2014 cannot be litigated in court, but must instead be referred to the NRAB for compulsory arbitration. 45 U.S.C. \u00a7 153 First (i); <em>see Crasos, </em>786 F.2d at 972; <em>Graf v.

Allowing employees to bring actions based upon such state tort claims would undermine two significant policy determinations Congress made in enacting the RLA: (1) that railroad labor disputes should be resolved through grievance procedures and arbitration, rather than litigation in the state and federal courts, <em>see Sheehan, </em>439 U.S. at 94, 99 S.Ct. at 402; <em>see also Lan</em><page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"1291\">*1291</page-number><em>caster, </em>773 F.2d at 815 (\u201cThe courts see such suits [based on state tort theories] ... as end runs around the Railway Labor Act\u2019s policy of channeling employment disputes to arbitration.\u201d); and (2) that railroad employees who are wrongfully discharged are entitled to reinstatement and back pay, but should not recover damages for any resulting emotional injuries. <em>See Buell, </em>771 F.2d at 1323; <em>see also Peterson, </em>759 F.2d at 1169 (\u201cThe scheme of remedies and procedures carefully crafted in the RLA [which does not include remedies for emotional distress] has long been interpreted as evidence of congressional intent specifically to limit an aggrieved party\u2019s right to resort to state law as an alternative remedy for a wrongful discharge.\u201d).</p>\n<p id=\"b1367-5\">For the same reasons, courts have permitted employees to litigate federal law claims relating to discharges or terms of employment, and thus to circumvent the RLA\u2019s grievance and arbitral procedures, only when their claims are <em>\u201cpremised on a specific federal statutory section,\u201d Jackson, </em>717 F.2d at 1050 (emphasis added), <em>accord Landfried v.

Courts have recognized that to adopt a broader approach and permit freer access to the courts by employees asserting discharge- or employment-related claims based on federal statutes would undermine Congress\u2019s determination that the RLA\u2019s grievance and arbitral procedures should be exclusive and its decision to limit the remedies available to railroad employees asserting employment-related claims. <em>See Jackson, </em>717 F.2d at 1050-51; <em>see also Lancaster, </em>773 F.2d at 813-14. Moreover, it would enable employees effectively to circumvent the Supreme Court\u2019s and other courts\u2019 decisions finding RLA preemption of state tort remedies, simply by recharacterizing their state tort claims as implicating the policies or purposes underlying various federal statutes. <em>See generally Jackson, </em>717 F.2d at 1048-51.</p>\n<p id=\"b1367-7\">Thus, courts have permitted actions by railroad employees challenging discharges or employment conditions when such challenges have been explicitly authorized by the Universal Military Training and Service Act, 50 U.S.C.App. \u00a7 459(d) (repealed 1974), <em>see McKinney v.

The Relationship of the FELA and RLA to Lewy\u2019s Discharge-Related Claims</em>\n</p>\n<p id=\"b1368-9\">Thus, in the present action, for Lewy to assert his discharge-related claims in court under the FELA and avoid the preclusive effect of the RLA, his claims must be based upon a specific provision of the FELA, and Congress must have intended that such claims be litigated in FELA actions. <em>See Gonzalez, </em>773 F.2d at 643; <em>Jackson, </em>717 F.2d at 1050. Since neither of these requirements is satisfied, we conclude that the RLA precludes Lewy from raising these claims as part of his FELA action, and that they can be asserted only through the grievance and arbitral procedures prescribed by the RLA.</p>\n<p id=\"b1368-10\">First, no provision of the FELA directly supports Lewy\u2019s claims for wrongful discharge or for emotional distress damages resulting from his discharge. In determining whether particular FELA provisions authorize employees to bring discharge-re<page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"1293\">*1293</page-number>lated claims despite the preclusive effect of the RLA, our court and others have carefully scrutinized the language of those provisions and their legislative history. Only in the case of FELA section 10, 45 U.S.C. \u00a7 60, has any court found explicit authorization for employees to challenge allegedly wrongful discharges. <em>See Gonzalez, </em>773 F.2d at 641-42, 644-45; <em>accord Hendley, </em>609 F.2d at 1150-53; <em>see also Woodrum, </em>571 F.Supp. at 357-58. Moreover, no court, including those authorizing discharge-related claims to be brought under FELA section 10, has permitted employees to seek damages under the FELA for the emotional distress resulting from their discharges. <em>See, e.g., Hendley, </em>609 F.2d at 1150-53.</p>\n<p id=\"b1369-5\">FELA section 10 provides that \u201c[a]ny contract, rule, regulation, or device whatsoever, the purpose, intent, or effect of which [is] to prevent employees of any common carrier from furnishing voluntarily information to a person in interest as to the facts incident to the injury or death of any employee, shall be void.\u201d 45 U.S.C. \u00a7 60. The Fifth Circuit has ruled that although this provision does not explicitly establish a cause of action for railroad employees who are wrongfully discharged or disciplined, it provides federal statutory authority sufficient to overcome the preclusive effect of the RLA, and authorizes courts to enjoin ongoing disciplinary proceedings, order reinstatement, and award back pay to employees who have been discharged or disciplined in retaliation for furnishing information to potential FELA plaintiffs or other similarly \u201cinterested\u201d persons. <em>See Gonzalez, </em>773 F.2d at 641-42, 644-45; <em>Hendley, </em>609 F.2d at 1150-53; <em>see also Woodrum, </em>571 F.Supp. at 357-58. However, the Fifth Circuit has not suggested that section 10 would authorize an award of money damages to such employees for other injuries, such as emotional distress, resulting from their discharges or from being disciplined. <em>See Gonzalez, </em>773 F.2d at 641-42, 644; <em>Hendley, </em>609 F.2d at 1152-53. Nor would section 10\u2019s language (\u201c[a]ny ... device [for preventing employees from furnishing information] ... <em>shall be void\u201d) </em>support such an interpretation: at most, it appears to authorize courts to exercise equitable jurisdiction over retaliation claims, and thus to award back pay, but not additional money damages. 45 U.S.C. \u00a7 60 (emphasis added); <em>see Gonzalez, </em>773 F.2d at 641-42, 644; <em>Hendley, </em>609 F.2d at 1152-53 &amp; n. 5.</p>\n<p id=\"b1369-7\">Moreover, section 10 applies only to railroad employees discharged or disciplined <em>tor furnishing information to others; </em>it does not encompass employees who are discharged or disciplined because <em>they themselves initiate FELA actions. See Jackson, </em>717 F.2d at 1050-51; <em>see also Landfried, </em>721 F.2d at 256; 45 U.S.C. \u00a7 60. Thus, even accepting the Fifth Circuit\u2019s interpretation of FELA section 10, Lewy is not within the class of persons that the provision protects, nor are his claims for emotional distress damages cognizable under it.</p>\n<p id=\"b1369-8\">Except for section 10, no other FELA provision has been held to provide federal statutory authorization for railroad employees seeking to litigate wrongful discharge claims in court. In <em>Bay v. Western Pacific Railroad, </em>595 F.2d 514 (9th Cir.1979), we specifically rejected the claim that FELA section 5, 45 U.S.C. \u00a7 55, establishes a private right of action for employees discharged in retaliation for bringing FELA claims. <em>See id. </em>at 515-16; <em>accord Davidson v. Long Island Railroad Co., </em>617 F.Supp. 67, 68-70 (S.D.N.Y.1985); <em>see also Jackson, </em>717 F.2d at 1051. Section 5 provides that \u201c[a]ny contract, rule, regulation, or device whatsoever, the purpose or intent of which [i]s to enable any common carrier to exempt itself from [FELA] liability ... shall to that extent be void.\u201d 45 U.S.C. \u00a7 55. We noted in <em>Bay </em>that \u201c[o]n its face [section 5] does not create a private cause of action,\u201d and concluded, based on the provision\u2019s legislative history and that of its predecessor, that Congress did not intend section 5 to establish a right of action for railroad employees separate from that under FELA section 1. <em>Bay, </em>595 F.2d at 515-16. We concluded that Con<page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"1294\">*1294</page-number>gress enacted section 5 instead to prevent employers being sued under section 1 from claiming as a defense that the employees bringing suit had contracted away their rights under the FELA, and therefore were not eligible to recover damages under the Act. <em>See id. </em>at 516; <em>see also Landfried, </em>721 F.2d at 256. Thus, since section 5 was enacted to eliminate a potential defense to section 1 actions, and not to create a separate right of action, it does not provide a basis for Lewy\u2019s discharge-related claims.</p>\n<p id=\"b1370-4\">The only remaining FELA provision that could possibly provide statutory authority for Lewy\u2019s discharge-related claims is section 1 itself. <em>See </em>45 U.S.C. \u00a7 51; 45 U.S.C. \u00a7\u00a7 52-60. As we have previously noted, although courts have often interpreted this provision broadly, only one court \u2014 the Second Circuit in the <em>Sharkey </em>decision \u2014 has ever ruled that section 1 covers discharge- or employment-related claims. <em>See </em>Analysis, Section B-l, <em>supra; Sharkey, </em>493 F.2d at 690-92; <em>see also Brown v. World Airways, Inc., </em>539 F.Supp. 179, 181 (S.D.N.Y. 1982) (dictum). Moreover, three circuit courts \u2014 the Sixth, Seventh, and Eighth\u2014 have expressly ruled that section 1 does not establish a private right of action for employees discharged in retaliation for filing actions under the FELA. <em>See Jackson, </em>717 F.2d at 1050-51; <em>accord Minehart, </em>731 F.2d at 343-45; <em>Landfried, </em>721 F.2d at 254-56; <em>see Gonzalez, </em>773 F.2d at 644 &amp; n. 28; <em>Lancaster, </em>773 F.2d at 815; <em>see also Graf, </em>790 F.2d at 1348. These courts have concluded that the language of section 1 does not explicitly authorize actions for retaliatory discharge, and that even though such actions would vindicate \u201cthe policies underlying the FELA,\u201d that is not sufficient to \u201covercome the RLA mandate that [railroad employees\u2019] exclusive remedy [for wrongful discharge lies] with administrative grievance [and arbitral] procedures.\u201d <em>Jackson, </em>717 F.2d at 1051; <em>accord Land-fried, </em>721 F.2d at 256; <em>see Minehart, </em>731 F.2d at 344-45; <em>see also Gonzalez, </em>773 F.2d at 644 &amp; n. 28. As the Seventh Circuit stated in <em>Jackson v. Consolidated Rail Corp., </em>717 F.2d 1045 (7th Cir.1983), <em>cert. denied, </em>465 U.S. 1007, 104 S.Ct. 1000, 79 L.Ed.2d 233 (1984), \u201c[i]n a case ... involving a railway worker subject to the RLA, yet entitled to rely upon the FELA, there is a tension between the two federal statutes [, and] ... a court must be particularly reluctant to elevate an FELA policy to the status of a federal right.\u201d <em>Id. </em>at 1051 (citing <em>Bay).</em></p>\n<p id=\"b1370-6\">We conclude that in light of section l\u2019s language and courts\u2019 prior interpretations of the provision, section 1 does not provide a basis for Lewy\u2019s discharge-related claims. To the extent that Lewy claims he was discharged in retaliation for initiating his FELA action against Southern Pacific, we agree with the Sixth, Seventh, and Eighth Circuits that such a claim is not actionable under section 1. <em>See id. </em>at 1050-51; <em>accord Minehart, </em>731 F.2d at 343-45; <em>Landfried, </em>721 F.2d at 254-56. Section 1 mentions nothing about the right of employees to challenge or recover damages for a retaliatory discharge or for any discharge, for that matter. <em>See </em>45 U.S.C. \u00a7 51; <em>see also Jackson, </em>717 F.2d at 1050-51; <em>Landfried, </em>721 F.2d at 256.</p>\n<p id=\"b1370-7\">To the extent that Lewy claims that section 1 entitles him to recover damages for the aggravation of his preexisting injuries caused by his discharge, merely because his original injuries are compensable under that provision, <em>see generally Sharkey, </em>493 F.2d at 690-92, we also reject that contention. Section 1 authorizes employees \u201csuffering injury <em>while ... employed </em>\u201d to recover damages <em>\u201cfor such injury or death </em>\u201d; it does not authorize an award of damages for the subsequent aggravation of such an injury. 45 U.S.C. \u00a7 51 (emphasis added). Moreover, as noted above, in light of the provision\u2019s reference to \u201cinjuries] while ... employed,\u201d and its requirement that those injuries be caused by the \u201cnegligence\u201d of railroads and their employees, or by equipment \u201cdefect[s] or insufficiency,\u201d our court and others have interpreted section 1 to authorize an award of damages only for injuries sustained in the course of work-related duties, not for injuries arising outside the workplace or resulting from wrongful discharges. <em>Id.; </em><page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"1295\">*1295</page-number><em>see, e.g., Taylor, </em>787 F.2d at 1313-16; <em>Cra-sos, </em>786 F.2d at 971-72; <em>Buell, </em>771 F.2d at 1321-24; <em>Lancaster, </em>773 F.2d at 812 \u2014 16; <em>Yaum, </em>591 F.2d at 314-17. Thus, even though section 1 plainly authorizes Lewy to recover damages for the emotional distress and anxiety he sustained as a direct result of the March, 1980 collision, it does not authorize him to recover damages for the subsequent aggravation of that condition caused by his discharge. As a result, Lewy\u2019s discharge-related claims are not directly supported by any provision of the FELA.</p>\n<p id=\"b1371-5\">Moreover, Lewy\u2019s discharge-related claims do not satisfy the second requirement necessary to avoid the preclusive effect of the RLA: that those claims vindicate rights which Congress intended to be judicially enforced through FELA actions, rather than enforced through the RLA\u2019s grievance and arbitral procedures. <em>See Gonzalez, </em>773 F.2d at 643. Determining Congress\u2019s intent as to the relative scope of the FELA and RLA in this context \u201cinvolve[s] the same underlying issue\u201d that the Supreme Court and our court have addressed in cases involving RLA preemption of state tort remedies: \u201cwhether the defendant\u2019s [alleged] misconduct, although tortious, is the sort of conduct that Congress, if it had thought about the matter, would have wanted to channel through the grievance machinery set up by the RLA; or [is] instead the sort of conduct that Congress would have wanted to leave, concurrently or exclusively, to state or federal tort remedies.\u201d <em>Lancaster, </em>773 F.2d at 813-14. Congress\u2019s intent regarding the FELA\u2019s and RLA\u2019s coverage of wrongful discharge claims should be consistent with its intent concerning the RLA\u2019s preemption of state tort remedies for wrongful discharge. <em>See id. </em>at 813.</p>\n<p id=\"b1371-6\">If employees like Lewy are permitted to assert wrongful discharge claims under the FELA, they will be entitled to bring actions based on such claims in state or federal court, 45 U.S.C. \u00a7 56, and the actions they initiate in state court will not be removable to federal court. 28 U.S.C. \u00a7 1445(a) (1982); <em>see Lancaster, </em>773 F.2d at 814. Moreover, they will be entitled in such actions to the full range of remedies available under the FELA, including damages for emotional distress. <em>See Taylor, </em>787 F.2d at 1313; <em>Buell, </em>771 F.2d at 1324; <em>see also Urie, </em>337 U.S. at 181-82, 69 S.Ct. at 1030. However, as noted above, the Supreme Court and our court have concluded in a series of cases that in enacting the RLA, Congress consciously intended to minimize litigation of railroad labor disputes in the state and federal courts and to limit wrongfully discharged employees to the remedies of reinstatement and back pay. <em>See Shee-han, </em>439 U.S. at 94, 99 S.Ct. at 402; <em>Andrews, </em>406 U.S. at 325, 92 S.Ct. at 1565; <em>Buell, </em>771 F.2d at 1323; <em>Beers, </em>703 F.2d at 429; <em>Magnuson, </em>576 F.2d at 1369-70; <em>see also </em>Analysis, Section B-2, <em>supra. </em>Allowing employees like Lewy to challenge their discharges in court under the FELA will directly undermine these objectives, and will enable employees effectively to circumvent the Supreme Court\u2019s and our decisions holding that the RLA preempts most state-created judicial remedies for wrongful discharge. <em>See, e.g., Andrews, </em>406 U.S. at 323-326, 92 S.Ct. at 1564-65; <em>Beers, </em>703 F.2d at 429; <em>Magnuson, </em>576 F.2d at 1369-70; <em>see also </em>Analysis, Section B-2, <em>supra. </em>We cannot conclude that Congress intended such a result.</p>\n<p id=\"b1371-8\">Furthermore, permitting wrongful discharge claims to be litigated in courts under the FELA will undermine the integrity and independence of the NRAB in resolving such claims. Even in cases like the present one, where the NRAB reviewed Lewy\u2019s wrongful discharge claim and ordered him to be reinstated prior to any court litigation under the FELA, allowing courts to supplement the remedies ordered by the NRAB will necessarily infringe upon its decision-making authority and its ability to effect binding resolutions of \u201cminor\u201d disputes. The Supreme Court has indicated that in enacting the RLA, Congress \u201ccreated [the NRAB] as a tribunal consisting of workers and management to secure the prompt, orderly and <em>final </em>settlement of grievances that arise daily between <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"1296\">*1296</page-number>employees and carriers,\u201d and the Court has noted that the <em>NRAB\u2019s \u201ceffectiveness ... in fulfilling its task depends on the finality of its determinations. \u201d Sheehan, </em>439 U.S. at 94, 99 S.Ct. at 402 (emphasis added). Yet if employees are permitted to bring FELA actions whenever the NRAB rules that they have been wrongfully discharged, or when the NRAB rejects such claims, the NRAB\u2019s determinations of such issues will never effectively be \u201cfinal.\u201d</p>\n<p id=\"b1372-4\">In Lewy\u2019s case, for example, the NRAB ordered him reinstated based purely upon procedural grounds, and did not reach the merits of his wrongful discharge claims; it thus achieved an equilibrium in Lewy\u2019s case without interpreting the collective bargaining agreement or determining which party was at fault as to his discharge. However, if Lewy is permitted to litigate his discharge-related claims under the FELA, the NRAB\u2019s resolution of these claims will not have concluded the dispute \u2014 the trial court will still be required to determine the lawfulness of his discharge. We find it unlikely that Congress intended such a result, given its desire that in most cases, the NRAB should provide a final, and hopefully peaceful, resolution of \u201cminor\u201d disputes. <em>See Sheehan, </em>439 U.S. at 94, 99 S.Ct. at 402.</p>\n<p id=\"b1372-5\">Finally, to the extent that Lewy claims only that employees like himself, who sustain physical and emotional injuries com-pensable under the FELA, can also recover FELA damages for the aggravation of those injuries caused by wrongful discharges, we conclude that such a result would not be consistent with Congress\u2019s intent in enacting the FELA and RLA. There is no coherent basis for singling out the discharges of these employees and treating them differently from all other discharges under the RLA, simply because of the fortuity that the discharged employees were also injured in \u201caccidents\u201d covered by the FELA. We conclude that in a case like Lewy\u2019s, the underlying purposes and principles of both the FELA and the RLA will be accommodated if Lewy is fully compensated under the FELA for the damages directly flowing from the March, 1980 collision, and yet limited to the RLA\u2019s procedures and remedies for his claims arising directly out of his October, 1980 discharge.</p>\n<p id=\"b1372-8\">For all these reasons, we conclude that Congress did not intend for railroad employees like Lewy to assert discharge-related claims in the courts under the FELA. We conclude that the RLA precludes employees from litigating such claims in the courts and requires them to raise these claims exclusively through its grievance and arbitral procedures.</p>\n<p id=\"b1372-9\">Nor are we persuaded otherwise by the Second Circuit\u2019s 1974 decision in <em>Sharkey v. Penn Central Transportation Co., </em>493 F.2d 685 (2d Cir.1974), upon which Lewy relies. <em>Sharkey </em>involved a railroad ticket collector-conductor who was injured in a head-on train collision, developed a \u201cpost-traumatic conversion hysteria,\u201d and was subsequently discharged following a hearing concerning his possible responsibility for the accident. <em>Id. </em>at 687-88. The employee filed an FELA action in federal district court, and initiated a proceeding before the NRAB seeking reinstatement and back pay under RLA section 153 First (i). The principal question on appeal before the Second Circuit was whether the employee could recover damages in his FELA action for the aggravation of his psychological condition caused by his discharge, since he could not recover such damages in the NRAB proceeding. <em>Id. </em>at 688.</p>\n<p id=\"b1372-10\">The Second Circuit noted that the doctrines of proximate and intervening cause apply under the FELA, and that under these doctrines, negligent actors can be held liable for \u201ccertain kinds of aggravation of the injuries\u201d they cause, as long as the events producing the aggravation are \u201creasonably foreseeable.\u201d<footnotemark>9</footnotemark> <em>Id. </em>at 690-91; <em>see </em>Prosser &amp; Keeton, <em>The Law of Torts </em><page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"1297\">*1297</page-number>\u00a7 44, at 301-19 (1984). As the court pointed out, these \u201cforeseeable\u201d causes of aggravation could presumably include acts committed intentionally by a defendant railroad itself, such as a discharge. <em>See Shar-key, </em>493 F.2d at 691. Thus, the Second Circuit concluded in <em>Sharkey </em>that to the extent the injured employee\u2019s discharge and its aggravating effect were \u201creasonably foreseeable\u201d at the time of the collision, they were proximately caused by the collision. <em>See id. </em>at 690-91. Moreover, the court concluded that if the NRAB found the discharge to be \u201cwrongful\u201d \u2014 that is, primarily attributable to improper actions by the railroad, as- opposed to the employee \u2014 the discharge must be considered a \u201cnormal intervening cause,\u201d the railroad\u2019s liability under the FELA would not be \u201csuperseded,\u201d and therefore, the employee could recover under the FELA for the aggravating effect of his discharge.<footnotemark>10</footnotemark> <em>Id. </em>at 691-92.</p>\n<p id=\"b1373-5\">However, in its analysis in <em>Sharkey, </em>the Second Circuit appears not to have considered the preclusive effect of the RLA, the fact that Congress intended most railroad labor disputes to be resolved outside the courts, or the possibility that Congress may not have intended the FELA to supplement the RLA\u2019s remedies of back pay and reinstatement. Although, as noted above, virtually every other court to have considered the issue has concluded that federal law claims relating to discharges of railroad employees can be litigated in court only if they are based upon \u201ca specific federal statutory section,\u201d <em>Jackson, </em>717 F.2d at 1050, and involve \u201crights intended by Congress to be judicially enforced,\u201d <em>Gonzalez, </em>773 F.2d at 643; <em>see </em>Analysis, Section B-2, <em>supra, </em>the <em>Sharkey </em>court never addressed either of these requirements, and instead based its decision upon general tort principles and a policy-oriented desire to provide railroad employees with full recovery for all their injuries. <em>See Sharkey, </em>493 F.2d at 690-92. However, as we have noted, our court and others have held that claims alleging \u201conly a violation of the policy underlying a federal statute,\u201d rather than a violation of explicit statutory provisions, are not sufficient to overcome the RLA\u2019s preclusive effect. <em>Jackson, </em>717 F.2d at 1050; <em>accord Railway Labor Executives, </em>430 F.2d at 997; <em>see </em>Analysis, Section B-2, <em>supra. </em>As we have indicated, no reported decision appears to have followed <em>Sharkey\u2019s </em>conclusion that discharge-related damages may be recoverable under the FELA. <em>But cf. Brown, </em>539 F.Supp. at 181 (dictum).</p>\n<p id=\"b1373-9\">For all these reasons, we reject the Second Circuit\u2019s conclusion in <em>Sharkey. </em>We conclude that the RLA precludes Lewy from raising claims relating to his discharge under the FELA.</p>\n<p id=\"b1373-10\">Because Lewy\u2019s discharge-related claims are not cognizable under the FELA, the trial court should have excluded all evidence relating to his discharge on the ground that it was irrelevant under Federal Rule of Evidence 402. <em>See </em>Fed.R.Evid. 402. We therefore affirm the trial court\u2019s decision to exclude that evidence. <em>See Lof-ton, </em>781 F.2d at 1392 (court of appeals may affirm trial court ruling on any ground supported by the record).</p>\n<p id=\"b1373-11\">\n<em>C. Exclusion of Evidence Relating to Jere Brown\u2019s Bias</em>\n</p>\n<p id=\"b1373-12\">Lewy\u2019s remaining claims are meritless. He contends that the trial court abused its discretion when it limited his testimony concerning Jere Brown\u2019s bias against him and his cross-examination of Brown, based upon Federal Rule of Evidence 403. Lewy maintains that the exclusion of this evi<page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"1298\">*1298</page-number>dence effectively prevented him from establishing Brown\u2019s bias and her lack of credibility.</p>\n<p id=\"b1374-4\">We reject Lewy\u2019s contention. The Supreme Court has indicated that \u201c[p]roof of [a witness\u2019s] bias is almost always relevant [under Federal Rule 401, and therefore admissible under Federal Rule 402,] because the jury, as finder of fact and weigher of credibility, has historically been entitled to assess all evidence which might bear on the accuracy and truth of a witness\u2019 testimony\u201d; moreover, a \u201cshowing of bias ... would have a tendency to make the facts to which [the witness] testified less probable in the eyes of the jury than [they] would be without such testimony.\u201d<footnotemark>11</footnotemark> <em>United States v. Abel, </em>469 U.S. 45, 105 S.Ct. 465, 468-69, 83 L.Ed.2d 450 (1984); <em>see also Delaware v. Van Arsdall, </em>\u2014 U.S. -, 106 S.Ct. 1431, 1435, 89 L.Ed.2d 674 (1986). Thus, Lewy was entitled to introduce evidence of Brown\u2019s bias both by cross-examining her and through presentation of extrinsic evidence \u2014 in this case, Lewy\u2019s own testimony. <em>See Abel, </em>105 S.Ct. at 468-69; <em>see also Van Arsdall, </em>106 S.Ct. at 1435; <em>Reiger v. Christensen, </em>789 F.2d 1425, 1433 (9th Cir.1986); 3 Weinstein and Berger, <em>Weinstein\u2019s Evidence </em>\u00a7 607[03], at 607-23 (1986).</p>\n<p id=\"b1374-7\">However, the Supreme Court and our court have held that while parties are usually entitled to introduce some evidence of witnesses\u2019 biases, courts have \u201cwide discretion\u201d under Rule 403 to impose limits on the quantity and type of evidence that they introduce. <em>Abel, </em>105 S.Ct. at 470; <em>accord Van Arsdall, </em>106 S.Ct. at 1435; <em>see Reiger, </em>789 F.2d at 1433; <em>see also United States v.

As long as a jury is provided \u201csufficient information [overall] to appraise the bias and motives of [a] witness,\u201d we have generally not found the trial court to have abused its discretion.<footnotemark>12</footnotemark> <em>United States v. Ray, </em>731 F.2d 1361, 1364-65 (9th Cir.1984); <em>accord Jackson, </em>756 F.2d at 707; <em>Skinner v. Cardwell, </em>564 F.2d 1381, 1389 (9th Cir.1977), <em>cert. denied, </em>435 U.S. 1009, 98 S.Ct. 1883, 56 L.Ed.2d 392 (1978).</p>\n<p id=\"b1374-13\">In the present action, the trial court permitted Lewy to introduce testimony that there was \u201cbad blood\u201d between him and Brown, and that her removal as executrix of their father\u2019s estate and his subsequent appointment as executor \u201cto investigate her dealings\u201d had \u201ccaused a flare-up in [their] relationship.\u201d Moreover, it permitted extensive cross-examination of Brown concerning her removal as executrix and the charges of embezzlement against her. The trial court restricted testimony only involving the \u201cside issue[s]\u201d of whether Brown actually embezzled funds from the estate and whether her share of the estate was ultimately withheld from her: the court ostensibly wanted to avoid debating and relitigating these matters in Lewy\u2019s FELA action.</p>\n<p id=\"b1374-14\">Thus, the trial court accorded Lewy ample opportunity to demonstrate that he and Brown had a hostile relation<page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"1299\">*1299</page-number>ship, and that Brown might therefore be inclined to slant her testimony against him. <em>See Abel, </em>105 S.Ct. at 469. It is not clear that further testimony indicating that Brown actually embezzled funds, which might have been extremely time-consuming and confusing to the jury, would have made the likelihood that she slanted her testimony against Lewy appear any greater in the jury\u2019s eyes; the jury already had a basis to conclude that Brown was biased against Lewy regardless of whether she was in fact an embezzler whom he discovered or an innocent person whom he unjustly accused of embezzlement.<footnotemark>13</footnotemark> We conclude that the jury had \u201csufficient information to appraise [Brown\u2019s] bias and motives\u201d in testifying against Lewy, <em>Ray, </em>731 F.2d at 1364-65; <em>accord Jackson, </em>756 F.2d at 707, and therefore conclude that the trial court's limited exclusion of evidence relating to Brown\u2019s alleged embezzlement did not constitute an abuse of discretion. <em>See Abel, </em>105 S.Ct. at 470.</p>\n<p id=\"b1375-5\">\n<em>D. The Trial Court\u2019s Jury Instructions</em>\n</p>\n<p id=\"b1375-6\">Finally, Lewy challenges the trial court\u2019s jury instructions, claiming that they were repetitive and unduly emphasized Southern Pacific\u2019s contention that he was guilty of contributory negligence and that any judgment in his favor should therefore be reduced. We disagree.</p>\n<p id=\"A7I\">We have recently stated that \u201c[s]o long as [jury] instructions fairly and adequately cover the issues presented, the judge\u2019s formulation of those instructions or choice of language is a matter of discretion.\u201d <em>United States v. Echeverry, </em>759 F.2d 1451, 1455 (9th Cir.1985); <em>accord Carvalho, </em>794 F.2d at 455-56. Lewy does not contend that any of the jury instructions were erroneous. He maintains only that a single instruction, which defined the principle of causation, was \u201cunnecessary\u201d and \u201crepetitive,\u201d and focussed the jury\u2019s attention upon his possible contributory negligence. However, the mere fact that an instruction is repetitive is not a basis for reversal, as long as the legal principles it enunciates are correct: we have specifically held, albeit in a slightly different context, that a judge\u2019s repetition to the jury of an instruction that correctly states the law is not reversible error. <em>See Gebhard v. United States, </em>422 F.2d 281, 288-89 (9th Cir.1970). Moreover, as noted above, although Lewy contends that the challenged instruction focussed undue attention upon his conduct, it nowhere contains the words \u201cplaintiff\u201d or \u201cLewy,\u201d and simply refers to the \u201cnegligence <em>...of any party.\u201d</em></p>\n<p id=\"b1375-10\">Lewy contends that because the challenged instruction immediately followed an instruction discussing contributory negligence, the jury would logically interpret it as referring primarily to him. <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"1308\">*1308</page-number>However, the preceding instruction also mentioned the possibility that the jury could find Southern Pacific negligent. As a result, we conclude that the jury logically would have interpreted the challenged instruction to refer to <em>both </em>parties. Based upon our review of the instructions as a whole, we conclude that they were not \u201c \u2018misleading or ... inadequate to guide the jury\u2019s deliberations,\u2019 \u201d <em>Shortt Accountancy, </em>785 F.2d at 1454, and that the trial court did not abuse its discretion in formulating the instructions as it did. <em>See Benny, </em>786 F.2d at 1416; <em>accord Carvalho, </em>794 F.2d at 455-56; <em>Los Angeles Memorial Coliseum, </em>791 F.2d at 1360.</p>\n<p id=\"b1376-4\">CONCLUSION</p>\n<p id=\"b1376-5\">We conclude that the RLA precluded Lewy from recovering damages based upon his discharge in his FELA action. As a result, we conclude that the trial judge properly excluded Lewy\u2019s evidence relating to his discharge. We also conclude that the trial judge did not abuse his discretion either in limiting the presentation of evidence relating to Jere Brown\u2019s bias or in instructing the jury as he did. We therefore affirm the judgment of the district court.</p>\n<p id=\"b1376-6\">AFFIRMED.</p>\n<footnote label=\"1\">\n<p id=\"b1361-8\">. Because we conclude that the RLA precluded the district court from awarding Lewy damages resulting from his discharge, <em>see </em>Analysis, Section B-3, <em>infra, </em>we need not review the trial judge's ruling excluding evidence relating to Lewy\u2019s discharge under Rule 403. This evidence was simply not relevant in Lewy\u2019s FELA action, and therefore should have been excluded under Federal Rule of Evidence 402. <em>See </em>Fed. R.Evid. 402.</p>\n</footnote>\n<footnote label=\"2\">\n<p id=\"b1362-8\">. The instruction on contributory negligence that immediately preceded the challenged instruction was as follows:</p>\n<blockquote id=\"b1362-9\">Section 3 of the Federal Employer\u2019s [sic] Liability Act provides [that] ... the fact that [an injured] employee may have been guilty of contributory negligence shall not bar a recovery but the damages shall be diminished by the jury in proportion to the amount of negligence attributable to such employee. So if you should find from a preponderance of the evidence in this case that the defendant was guilty of negligence which caused in whole or in part any injury or damage to the plaintiff, and if you should further find from a preponderance of the evidence in the case that the plaintiff, himself, was guilty of some contributory negligence which contributed toward bringing about all or part of his own injury, then the total award of damages to the plaintiff must be reduced by an amount equal to the percentage of fault or contributory negligence chargeable to the plaintiff.</blockquote>\n</footnote>\n<footnote label=\"3\">\n<p id=\"b1362-10\">. The parties originally did not raise the issue of whether the RLA bars Lewy\u2019s claim for discharge-related damages in this appeal. However, as noted above, Southern Pacific raised the issue in a pretrial motion at the district court. Because it relates to whether the district court could exercise subject-matter jurisdiction over Lewy\u2019s claim, <em>see Crusos v. United Transportation Union, Local 1201, </em>786 F.2d 970, 972-73 (9th Cir.1986); <em>see also Jackson v. Consolidated Rail Corp., </em>717 F.2d 1045, 1054-55 (7th Cir.1983), ce<em>rt. denied, </em>465 U.S. 1007, 104 S.Ct. 1000, 79 L.Ed.2d 233 (1984); <em>de la Rosa Sanchez v.

In <em>Beanland </em>v. <em>Chicago, Rock Island and Pacific Railroad Co., </em>480 F.2d 109 (8th Cir.1973), the Eighth Circuit was required to determine, as we are in the present case, whether discharge-related damages are recoverable under the FELA. It concluded that such damages are not recoverable, because \u201c[d]amages resulting from <em>intentional </em>acts, such as [a] discharge, have no place in a personal injury F.E.L.A. action which deals exclusively with <em>negligence.\u201d Id. </em>at 113 (citing 45 U.S.C. \u00a7 51) (emphasis in original); <em>accord Fullerton v.

First, as noted in the text, <em>supra, </em>we do not agree that the FELA section l\u2019s reference to \"negligence\" can be read so restrictively as to exclude all intentional torts from the provision\u2019s coverage. Second, the Eighth Circuit\u2019s opinion in <em>Beanland </em>does not address the preclusive effect of the RLA, which we consider critical in determining the scope of the FELA\u2019s coverage.</p>\n</footnote>\n<footnote label=\"6\">\n<p id=\"b1364-11\">.

The Supreme Court has defined bias as \"the relationship between a party and a witness which might lead the witness to slant, unconsciously or otherwise, his testimony in favor or against a party. Bias may be induced by a witness\u2019 like, dislike, or fear of a party, or by the witness' self-interest.\u201d <em>United States </em>v. <em>Abel, </em>469 U.S. 45, 105 S.Ct. 465, 469, 83 L.Ed.2d 450 (1984).</p>\n</footnote>\n<footnote label=\"12\">\n<p id=\"b1374-9\">. <em>United States v. Harvey, </em>547 F.2d 720 (2d Cir.1976), the primary case upon which Lewy relies concerning his right to introduce evidence of Brown\u2019s bias against him, is inapposite. In <em>Harvey, </em>the Second Circuit reversed the trial court for completely excluding testimony that the sole witness implicating the defendant in a particular bank robbery had previously accused him of fathering her child and refusing to support it. <em>Id. </em>at 722. The Second Circuit held that although the trial court had discretion to limit the evidence of bias a party introduces, the total exclusion of such evidence in Harvey\u2019s case prevented him from advancing a possible defense. <em>Id. </em>at 723; <em>see also Delaware v. Van Arsdall, </em>\u2014 U.S. -, 106 S.Ct. 1431, 1435-36, 89 L.Ed.2d 674 (1986). In contrast, in Lewy\u2019s case, the trial court did not totally exclude evidence of Brown's possible bias.</p>\n</footnote>\n<footnote label=\"13\">\n<p id=\"b1375-7\">. Lewy\u2019s counsel maintained both at trial and in his original appellate brief that he sought to introduce testimony concerning the embezzlement charges against Brown solely to demonstrate her bias. As we have noted, Lewy was permitted to introduce sufficient testimony at trial to establish that Brown may have been biased against him.</p>\n<p id=\"b1375-8\">However, in Lewy\u2019s reply brief, he contends for the first time that the testimony relating to Brown\u2019s alleged embezzlement should have been permitted on the ground that it related to the issue of Brown\u2019s credibility. This contention is meritless. Federal Rule of Evidence 608(b) prohibits the use of extrinsic evidence to prove specific instances of conduct on the part of a witness that are intended to undermine her credibility. Fed.R.Evid. 608(b); <em>see Abel, </em>105 S.Ct. at 470-71; 3 Weinstein and Berger, \u00a7 608[05], at 608-21-22. Thus, Rule 608(b) would not have authorized Lewy to testify in his direct examination concerning Brown\u2019s alleged embezzlement in order to demonstrate her <em>lack of credibility, see </em>Fed.R.Evid. 608(b), and he was permitted to offer such testimony only to demonstrate her <em>bias. See Abel, </em>105 S.Ct. at 470-71. Moreover, although Rule 608(b) authorized Lewy to cross-examine Brown on specific instances of her conduct that would be probative on the issue of her credibility, the rule expressly authorizes courts to limit such questioning \u201cin [their] discretion.\u201d Fed.R.Evid. 608(b); <em>see also </em>3 Weinstein and Berger, 608[05], at 608-33-35. As noted above, the trial court permitted Lewy to cross-examine Brown to a certain extent about the embezzlement charges against her. Thus, even if Lewy had timely claimed that the evidence of Brown\u2019s alleged embezzlement was offered to demonstrate her lack of credibility, we would conclude that the trial court did not abuse its discretion in limiting that evidence as it did. <em>See </em>Fed.R.Evid. 608(b).</p>\n</footnote>\n</opinion>\n</casebody>\n",
