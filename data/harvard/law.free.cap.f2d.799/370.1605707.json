GIBSON, Senior Circuit Judge.</author>\n<p id=\"b449-13\">The Secretary of Health and Human Services (\u201cSecretary\u201d) appeals from the district court\u2019s<footnotemark>1</footnotemark> order directing the Secretary to pay an attorney\u2019s fee from past-due supplemental security income (SSI) benefits awarded to the attorney\u2019s client Mary Alice Galbreath, under Title XVI of the Social Security Act (\u201cAct\u201d). The Secretary argues that the Act does not authorize the withholding of past-due SSI benefits for the payment of attorney\u2019s fees. We affirm the district court\u2019s order.</p>\n<p id=\"b449-17\">Mary Alice Galbreath applied for SSI benefits on May 26, 1982. The Secretary denied Galbreath\u2019s application; on August 10, 1983 Galbreath appealed this administrative decision to the federal district court. On February 15, 1985 the district court reversed the Secretary\u2019s denial of Gal-breath\u2019s claim, and the Secretary proceeded to effectuate the court\u2019s decision. Gal-breath was sent a check dated July 23, 1985 in the amount of $7,954.00. Gal-breath\u2019s attorney, Anthony W. Bartels, then moved the court for attorney\u2019s fees in the amount of $1,988.50, or 25% of Gal-breath\u2019s past-due benefits. In its order, the district court determined that the amount requested by Bartels was reasonable, and ordered the Secretary \u201cto compute, certify and pay\u201d Bartels his requested fee.</p>\n<p id=\"b449-18\">On appeal to this court, the Secretary argues that neither the Act nor the Secretary\u2019s regulations authorized the withholding of past-due benefits for payment of attorney\u2019s fees in SSI cases, and that therefore the district court was without the power to order the Secretary to withhold attorney\u2019s fees from Galbreath\u2019s benefits for payment to Bartels.<footnotemark>2</footnotemark> The Secretary asserts that the section of the Act relied on by the district court in its order, 42 U.S.C. \u00a7 406(b)(1), pertains only to attorney\u2019s fees for services before the court in Title II (disability benefits) cases, and that no counterpart for section 406(b)(1) exists in Title XVI. Without such statutory authority, the Secretary contends that he is obligated to authorize full payment of SSI benefits to a claimant on establishment of his or her entitlement to such benefits, without diverting part of the benefits in payment of an attorney\u2019s fee.</p>\n<p id=\"b449-19\">Before we reach the merits of the issue in dispute, some discussion of the differences between Titles II and XVI of the Act <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"372\">*372</page-number>is warranted. Title II of the Act provides benefits for insured individuals suffering from a disability rendering them unable to engage in substantial gainful activity. 42 U.S.C. \u00a7 423(a) and (d)(1)(A) (1982). Title XVI, on the other hand, which was enacted in 1972, affords benefits to persons who are aged, blind, or disabled and whose financial resources fall below minimum levels, regardless of whether they have insured status under Title II. 42 U.S.C. \u00a7 1382(a) (1982).</p>\n<p id=\"b450-4\">Before 1965, Title II did not expressly authorize a district court to award attorney\u2019s fees to a claimant\u2019s attorney. In <em>Celebrezze v. Sparks, </em>342 F.2d 286, 290 (5th Cir.1965), the Fifth Circuit held that the district court acted within its judicial power in providing that attorney\u2019s fees be paid out of past-due benefits recovered by a claimant. The court stated that section 205(g)<footnotemark>3</footnotemark> of the Act, 42 U.S.C. \u00a7 405(g), gave the district court \u201cfull judicial power to deal with the litigation * * * including the power * * * to provide for the payment from the past due benefits recovered by the claimant in the litigation of counsel fees for conducting it.\u201d 342 F.2d at 288. The court reasoned that giving the district court the authority to make attorney\u2019s fee awards out of past-due benefits would foster the important policy of assuring disability claimants of adequate legal representation. <em>Id. </em>at 289. Later in 1965 Congress, \u201cin effect, incorporated the <em>Sparks </em>rationale into Title II by an amendment,\u201d <em>Reid v. Heckler, </em>735 F.2d 757, 761 (3d Cir.1984), which was codified at 42 U.S.C. \u00a7 406(b)(1).<footnotemark>4</footnotemark></p>\n<p id=\"b450-8\">In 1972 Congress enacted Title XVI of the Act. 86 Stat. 1465 (1972) (current version at 42 U.S.C. \u00a7\u00a7 1381-1383 (1982)). Although Title XVI incorporates many sections of Title II, section 406(b)(1) is not expressly incorporated, nor does Title XVI, make any other provision for the direct payment of attorney\u2019s fees for representation before the district court. In regard to attorney\u2019s fees for representation before the agency under Title XVI, the House Ways and Means Committee stated its belief that the \u201cwithholding of attorney fees from [an] individual\u2019s benefits * * * * would be contrary to the purpose of the program.\u201d H.R.Rep. No. 231, 92d Cong., 2d Sess. 3, <em>reprinted in </em>1972 U.S.Code Cong. &amp; Ad.News 4989, 5142.-</p>\n<p id=\"b450-9\">As enacted, Title XVI called for hearing procedures \u201cthe same as under section 405(g) of Title II except that determinations of fact made by the Secretary would be conclusive and not subject to judicial review.\u201d <em>Reid, </em>735 F.2d at 761; 86 Stat. 1476. In 1976, however, Congress amended Title XVI to include judicial review of the Secretary\u2019s final determination in SSI cases. 42 U.S.C. \u00a7 1383(c)(3) provides: \u201cThe final determination of the Secretary after a hearing under paragraph (1) shall be subject to judicial review as provided in section 405(g) of this title to the same extent as the Secretary\u2019s final determinations under section 405 of this title.\u201d Thus the amendment was intended to result in the application of \u201cthe same rules of judicial review to title XVI cases as apply to title II cases.\u201d S.Rep. No. 550, 94th Cong., 1st Sess. 2, <em>reprinted in </em>1975 U.S.Code Cong. &amp; Ad.News 2347, 2350.</p>\n<p id=\"b451-4\"><page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"373\">*373</page-number>With this legislative history in mind, we take a look at those cases that have addressed the question of the district court\u2019s authority to award attorney\u2019s fees for services before the court in Title XVI cases. The Sixth Circuit, the Northern District of Florida, the Eastern District of Michigan, and the Northern District of Ohio have held that the district court is without authority to order the payment of attorney\u2019s fees from past-due SSI benefits. <em>See McCarthy v. Secretary of Health and Human Services, </em>793 F.2d 741, 744-45 (6th Cir.1986); <em>Brown v. Bowen, </em>No. PCA 84-4284-RV, slip op. at 3 (N.D.Fla. May 22, 1986) [Available on WESTLAW, DCTU database]; <em>Franklin v. Secretary of Health and Human Services, </em>525 F.Supp. 398, 399 (E.D.Mich.1981); <em>Baim v. Harris, </em>515 F.Supp. 227 (N.D.Ohio 1981). In so holding, these courts have relied on the lack of express authority in Title XVI for such fee awards, and especially on the failure of Congress to incorporate into Title XVI section 406(b)(1) of Title II, permitting the withholding of attorney\u2019s fees from past-due benefits. Further, in <em>McCarthy </em>the Sixth Circuit believed that the House Ways and Means Committee\u2019s position that the withholding of attorney\u2019s fees from benefits for representation before the agency \u201cwould be contrary to the purpose of the program,\u201d would apply equally to representation before the court. <em>McCarthy, </em>at 744.</p>\n<p id=\"b451-5\">The Third Circuit, the Eastern District of Kentucky, the Northern District of New York, the District of Maryland, and the Eastern District of Tennessee have all held that the district court does possess the authority to make an award of attorney\u2019s fees in SSI cases. <em>Reid v. Heckler, </em>735 F.2d at 762; <em>Mullanix v. Heckler, </em>624 F.Supp. 529, 530-31 (E.D.Ky.1986); <em>Adams v. Secretary of Health and Human Services, </em>596 F.Supp. 449, 453 (N.D.N.Y.1984); <em>Dolin v. Harris, </em>501 F.Supp. 97, 98 (D.Md. 1980); <em>Vaughn v. Califano, </em>442 F.Supp. 185, 188 (E.D.Tenn.1977).<footnotemark>5</footnotemark> These courts acknowledge the lack of express statutory authority for a court award of attorney\u2019s fees in SSI cases, but look to the legislative history of Title XVI to find that Congress intended the same treatment on representation and attorney fees as that provided for Title II claimants, and that courts possess an implied and inherent power to make such awards. Just as the Fifth Circuit in <em>Celebrezze v. Sparks, </em>342 F.2d at 288, held that section 405(g) gave courts the power to provide for the payment of attorney\u2019s fees from past-due Title II benefits, the Third Circuit in <em>Reid </em>reasoned that the 1976 amendment to Title XVI incorporating section 405(g) into Title XVI gives district courts the implied authority to grant attorney\u2019s fees in SSI cases. <em>See Reid, </em>735 F.2d at 761-62 (\u201c[S]ection 405(g) has been carried over into Title XVI and with that provision goes the implied and inherent power of the court set out in the <em>Sparks </em>case\u201d). Further, the court in <em>Vaughn </em>stated, \u201cAn integral part of the court\u2019s review under 42 U.S.C. \u00a7 405(g) relates to the attorney\u2019s fee provisions of 42 U.S.C. \u00a7 406(b).\u201d 442 F.Supp. at 187. <em>See also Mullanix, </em>624 F.Supp. at 531 (quoting Vaughn); <em>Adams, </em>596 F.Supp. at 452 (same).</p>\n<p id=\"b451-10\">In response to the Secretary\u2019s argument that Congress\u2019 failure to expressly incorporate \u00a7 406(b) into Title XVI was deliberate and militates against applying its provisions in Title XVI cases, the court in <em>Vaughn </em>stated:</p>\n<blockquote id=\"b451-11\">The defendant is obviously correct in its assertion that the Congress has expressly incorporated by reference certain sections of title II into title XVI. <em>See </em>42 U.S.C. \u00a7 1383(d)(1). However, this incorporation was not a part of the aforementioned 1976 amendment to title XVI, which provided for the judicial review of final administrative determinations denying this category of benefits. These statutory sections were incorporated thereinto by reference long before the Congress acted to grant this Court jurisdiction to review title XVI claims. Accordingly, such expressed incorporation <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"374\">*374</page-number>cannot be viewed as a congressional expression that the attorney fee provisions of 42 U.S.C. \u00a7 406(b) should not be applicable to the title XVI review procedure. Had the Congress, in passing the 1976 amendments to title XVI, <em>then </em>expressly incorporated by reference certain provisions of title II, but without mentioning \u00a7 406(b), <em>supra, </em>then the defendant\u2019s contention in this regard might have merit.</blockquote>\n<p id=\"b452-4\">442 F.Supp. at 187. The court in <em>Adams </em>made a similar response to the Secretary\u2019s citation to the House Report on the original Title XVI amendments that stated that withholding attorney\u2019s fees for representation before the Secretary in Title XVI cases \u201cwould be contrary to the purpose of the program.\u201d The court reasoned that \u201cthe Secretary\u2019s reliance on legislative history concerning the 1972 amendments cannot outweigh the clear legislative intent of the 1976 amendment making SSI cases subject to the same judicial review as disability cases.\u201d 596 F.Supp. at 453.</p>\n<p id=\"b452-5\">We find the position taken by the courts in <em>Reid </em>and <em>Vaughn </em>and their progeny, that the district court does have the power to award attorney\u2019s fees from past-due SSI benefits, more compelling than the opposite position taken by the Secretary. Absent express statutory prohibition, the district court possesses the inherent power to withhold and certify for payment an attorney\u2019s fee from SSI benefits. Congress made it very clear in amending Title XVI in 1976 to incorporate section 405(g) that the scope of judicial review under Title XVI was to be \u201cvirtually identical\u201d to that under Title II. <em>See </em>S.Rep. No. 550, 94th Cong., 1st Sess. 2, <em>reprinted in </em>1975 U.S.Code Cong. &amp; Ad. News 2347. Because we think that the authority to provide for the payment of attorney\u2019s fees is an integral part of the court\u2019s power of judicial review under section 405(g) and not contrary to the express intent of Congress, we hold that the district court did not err in directing the Secretary to pay attorney Bartels\u2019 fee from claimant Galbreath\u2019s past-due SSI benefits. In so holding, we acknowledge the conclusions of other courts that this result will promote the important policy of assuring adequate legal representation of SSI claimants. First, an award of fees to successful counsel furthers the congressional goal of providing SSI benefits through judicial review to those claimants who otherwise would not obtain such benefits. <em>See Reid, </em>735 F.2d at 760, 762; <em>Mullanix, </em>624 F.Supp. at 531; <em>Adams, </em>596 F.Supp. at 453. Second, adoption of the 25% ceiling provides some compensation and hence an incentive to counsel, while simultaneously barring higher fees through private contingency agreements. <em>Mullanix, </em>624 F.Supp. at 531; <em>Adams, </em>596 F.Supp. at 453.</p>\n<p id=\"b452-7\">The district court\u2019s order is affirmed.</p>\n<footnote label=\"1\">\n<p id=\"b449-15\">.

In case of any such judgment, no other fee may be payable or certified for payment for such representation except as provided in this paragraph.</blockquote>\n</footnote>\n<footnote label=\"5\">\n<p id=\"b451-6\">.
