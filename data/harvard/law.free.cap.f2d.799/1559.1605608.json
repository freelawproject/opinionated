(SEI) and sold in the United States by Sumitomo Electric U.S.A., Inc. (SEUSA) (collectively Sumitomo) did not violate section 337 of the Tariff Act of 1930, as amended, 19 U.S.C. \u00a7 1337 (1982).<footnotemark>1</footnotemark> Although the subject imports were found to infringe Coming\u2019s U.S. Patent No. 3,659,-915 covering certain optical waveguide fibers and to have been made abroad using a process claimed in Coming\u2019s U.S. Patent No. 3,933,454 covering a flame hydrolysis method for making optical waveguide fibers, the Commission found no effect or tendency to substantially injure a domestic industry within the meaning of section 337 because the quantity of imports had been, and were likely to remain, <em>de minimis. </em>Corning asserts that the Commission has misinterpreted the statutory injury requirement and erred in its findings of facts on this issue. Our jurisdiction over the appeal is found in 19 U.S.C. \u00a7 1337(c) (1982) and 28 U.S.C. \u00a7 1295(a)(6) (1982). We affirm. In view of our disposition of the appeal on the issues related to the determination of no injury, resolution of the patent issues is not necessary to this decision and we do not address them. That part of the decision below is vacated.</p>\n<p id=\"b1614-16\">I.</p>\n<p id=\"b1614-17\">\n<em>Procedural Background</em>\n</p>\n<p id=\"ali-dedup-1\">The Commission instituted the investigation at issue on April 5, 1984, on the basis <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"1563\">*1563</page-number>of a complaint by Corning. Corning alleged that Sumitomo was engaged in an unfair method of competition in the importation and sale of certain optical waveguide fibers. In particular, Coming ch\u00e1rged Sumitomo with direct infringement of claims 1 and 2 of Coming\u2019s U.S. Patent No. 3,659,915, which claims certain optical waveguide fibers, and with unauthorized importation and sale of fibers manufactured abroad using a process claimed in claims 1, 3 and 8 of Coming\u2019s U.S. Patent No. 3,933,-454, which claims a method for making optical waveguide fibers.<footnotemark>2</footnotemark></p>\n<p id=\"b1615-4\">The Commission referred the case to an administrative law judge for an evidentiary hearing and initial determination. On January 22, 1985, the AU issued his initial determination. He found that both patents were not proved to be invalid, or unenforceable, and were infringed by Sumitomo. The parties stipulated that the domestic industries operating under each patent were efficiently and economically operated. However, the AU found no effect or tendency to destroy or substantially injure the relevant industries. In this connection, he found that the optical waveguide fiber market in the United States had been expanding, and would continue to expand, faster than the capacity of the domestic industry to meet the demand. He also found that Sumitomo\u2019s imports had had no appreciable effect on the sales or prices of domestic producers and that such imports were likely to diminish in the years ahead.</p>\n<p id=\"b1615-5\">Both Corning and Sumitomo petitioned the Commission for review of various portions of the initial determination. On March 8, 1985, the Commission ordered review of the initial determination, but only with respect to the issue of whether Sumi-tomo\u2019s importation or sales had the <em>tendency </em>to substantially injure an industry in the United States.</p>\n<p id=\"b1615-6\">On April 18, 1985, the Commission completed its review, determined that there was no violation of section 337, and terminated the investigation. 50 Fed.Reg. 16,171 (1985). The Commission subsequently issued a written opinion. <em>In re Certain Optical Waveguide Fibers, </em>No. 337-TA-189 (May 20, 1985). In that opinion, the Commission affirmed the portion of the initial determination finding no tendency to substantially injure the relevant industries. The effect of the Commission\u2019s March, 1985 order and May, 1985 opinion was specifically declared to affirm the AU\u2019s initial determination in its entirety. 19 C.F.R. \u00a7 210.53(h).</p>\n<p id=\"b1615-9\">II.</p>\n<p id=\"b1615-10\">\n<em>The Commission Decision</em>\n</p>\n<p id=\"AD5G\">The Commission\u2019s decision holds that there are two domestic industries, corresponding to the subject matter of each of Coming\u2019s patents. The industry under the \u2019915 patent, that is, the patent claiming optical waveguide fibers, was found to consist of Corning and its licensees, AT &amp; T, ITT and SpecTran; the industry under the '454 patent for a process for making the fibers solely of Coming. Although licensed under the \u2019454 process, AT &amp; T, ITT and SpecTran do not produce their fiber by the patented process. With respect to members of either domestic industry, the Commission refused to include Northern Telecom, Inc. (NTI), which sells fiber in the United States imported from its parent Northern Telecom, Ltd. (NTL) which manufactures the fiber in Canada under a license from Corning. The Commission also excluded American Fiberoptics and Light-wave Technologies Co., alleged by Coming to be infringers of its patents, and Valtec Corporation, an alleged infringer which has become a licensee.</p>\n<p id=\"b1615-11\">Optical waveguide fiber is sold in both cabled and uncabled form. Uncabled fiber is sold to firms which cable the fiber for use in telecommunications and other applications. Corning makes and sells uncabled <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"1564\">*1564</page-number>fiber' only. AT &amp; T sells only cabled fiber. ITT makes both uncabled and cabled fiber, but its license contains restrictions on its sale of uncabled fiber. SpecTran sells only uncabled fiber. Sumitomo sells both cabled and uncabled fiber, competing with Corning in sales of uncabled fiber.</p>\n<p id=\"b1616-4\">In 1980, Sumitomo began importing and selling optical waveguide fiber in the United States. The U.S. market for optical waveguide fiber has grown with increasing rapidity since 1982 and is expected to double in size from 1985 to 1988. Detailed findings were made concerning the domestic producers\u2019 failed attempts to expand their production capacity to supply the burgeoning market. Corning itself has had to import fiber from overseas to meet its needs, as have other domestic manufacturers. Demand has outstripped supply across the industry. Coming\u2019s licensees and some of the cablers who sell Coming fiber testified that they are unaware of any business lost to Sumitomo. Sumitomo\u2019s sales efforts have been hampered by a lack of adequate product support service and marketing, and by an inability to offer quick delivery. The record indicates that its market share from imports has remained well under 1%.<footnotemark>3</footnotemark></p>\n<p id=\"b1616-5\">Sumitomo\u2019s inability to gain a significant share of the United States market was a principal reason behind Sumitomo\u2019s decision to build a facility in this country for research, development and production of optical waveguide fiber and cable. Sumito-mo began construction of its United States facility, Sumitomo Electric Research Triangle (SERT), in October, 1983, with production projected to begin in late 1985. It was found that SERT is intended to serve as Sumitomo\u2019s principal source of fiber and cable for the United States market. In conjunction with the start-up of SERT, Sumitomo intends to develop a sales, marketing and field engineering staff.</p>\n<p id=\"b1616-6\">The Commission determined that the record does not establish that Sumitomo\u2019s importation and sale of the accused optical waveguide fibers have \u201cthe effect or tendency to destroy or substantially injure\u201d the domestic industries, as required for exclusion under section 337. It rejected Coming\u2019s argument that sales activities related to Sumitomo\u2019s manufacture of fibers in the United States are relevant in determining injury. Rather, the Commission limited the injury inquiry to Sumitomo\u2019s sales of imported fibers. Finally, the Commission concluded that it would be speculative to find both that Sumitomo intended to substantially increase sales of imported fiber <em>and </em>that the domestic industry would be able to meet the rapidly expanding market on the evidence of record. While a lower quantum of proof of injury or tendency to injure is permitted in a patent-based section 337 case, per the Commission, mere speculation is not permitted.</p>\n<p id=\"b1616-11\">III.</p>\n<p id=\"b1616-12\">\n<em>The Standard of Appellate Review</em>\n</p>\n<p id=\"b1616-13\">Corning states the issues in this appeal in the following terms:</p>\n<blockquote id=\"b1616-14\">1. Was the Commission wrong in determining that SEI and SEUSA\u2019s importation and sale of optical waveguide fiber, held by the Commission to infringe Coming\u2019s valid patents, had no effect of substantially injuring an efficiently and economically operated United States industry?</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b1616-15\">2. Was the Commission wrong in determining that SEI and SEUSA\u2019s continued importation and sale of such optical waveguide fiber will have no tendency to injure substantially an efficiently and economically operated United States industry?</blockquote>\n<p id=\"b1616-16\">These statements of the issues misdirect the focus of the appeal. Like numerous other appellants, Corning essentially argues its case to this court as it did to the tribunal from which the appeal was taken. We are asked to decide the original issues <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"1565\">*1565</page-number>of the ease as if they had not already been decided.</p>\n<p id=\"b1617-4\">The appellate function is not to determine whether the findings and conclusions of the Commission were right or wrong, in the sense that the judges of this court would or would not reach the same result if they were to decide the matter in the first instance. Issues should be framed and addressed by parties to the appeal in the terms mandated by the standard of review. In this case, the standard of review is statutory. 19 U.S.C. \u00a7 1337(c) provides: \u201cAny person adversely affected by a final determination of the Commission under subsection (d), (e), or (f) may appeal such determination to the United States Court of Appeals for the Federal Circuit for review in accordance with chapter 7 of title 5, United States Code ... \u201d<footnotemark>4</footnotemark></p>\n<p id=\"b1617-5\">Under the above standard of review, a reviewing court \u201cshall decide all relevant questions of law.\u201d 5 U.S.C. \u00a7 706; <em>see SSIH Equipment S.A. v. United States, </em>718 F.2d 365, 371-72, 218 USPQ 678, 684 (Fed.Cir.1983). Thus, this court is not bound by the Commission\u2019s interpretation of statutory provisions. However, even though an issue may be denominated one of law, the court is not free simply to substitute its view for that of the Commission. Deference must be given to an interpretation of a statute by the agency charged with its administration. <em>United States v. Riverside Bayview Homes, Inc., </em>\u2014 U.S. -, 106 S.Ct. 455, 461, 88 L.Ed.2d 419 (1985). With respect to the meaning of the statutory requirements that an unfair method of competition must have \u201cthe effect or tendency ... to destroy or substantially injure a domestic industry ... in the United States,\u201d it is particularly within the province and expertise of the Commission to define those phrases.<footnotemark>5</footnotemark> Our function then becomes to decide whether the Commission\u2019s definitions or standards are <em>reasonable </em>in light of the language, policies and legislative history of the statute. <em>Id.; NLRB v. Transportation Management Corp., </em>462 U.S. 393, 402-03, 103 S.Ct. 2469, 2474-75, 76 L.Ed.2d 667 (1983); <em>see Bally/Midway Manufacturing Co. v. U.S. International Trade Commission, </em>714 F.2d 1117, 1121-22, 219 USPQ 97, 100 (Fed.Cir.1983) (Commission\u2019s interpretation overturned because of \u201canomalous results\u201d and \u201cbizarre effect\u201d).</p>\n<p id=\"b1617-18\">In contrast, with respect to issues of fact, our scope of review is narrowly limited. We may overturn a factual finding only if it is unsupported by substantial evidence. 5 U.S.C. \u00a7 706(2)(E); <em>American Hospital Supply Corp. v. Travenol Laboratories, Inc., </em>745 F.2d 1, 9, 223 USPQ 577, 583 (Fed.Cir.1984); <em>General Motors Corp. v. U.S. International Trade Commission, </em>687 F.2d 476, 479-80, 215 USPQ 484, 487-88 (CCPA 1982), <em>cert. denied, </em>459 U.S. <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"1566\">*1566</page-number>1105, 103 S.Ct. 729, 74 L.Ed.2d 953 (1983). This is the same as the stringent standard applicable to a trial court in taking a case from a jury or in review of a jury verdict on a JNOV. As stated in <em>Consolo v. Federal Maritime Commission, </em>383 U.S. 607, 619-20, 86 S.Ct. 1018, 1026, 16 L.Ed.2d 131 (1966):</p>\n<blockquote id=\"b1618-4\">We have defined \u201csubstantial evidence\u201d as \u201csuch relevant evidence as a reasonable mind might accept as adequate to support a conclusion.\u201d <em>Consolidated Edison Co. v. Labor Board, </em>305 U.S. 197, 229 [59 S.Ct. 206, 216, 83 L.Ed. 126]. \u201c[I]t must be enough to justify, if the trial were to a jury, a refusal to direct a verdict when the conclusion sought to be drawn from it is one of fact for the jury.\u201d <em>Labor Board v. Colombian Enameling &amp; Stamping Co., </em>306 U.S. 292, 300 [59 S.Ct. 501, 505, 83 L.Ed. 660]. This is something less than the weight of the evidence, and the possibility of drawing two inconsistent conclusions from the evidence does not prevent an administrative agency\u2019s finding from being supported by substantial evidence.</blockquote>\n<p id=\"b1618-5\">383 U.S. at 620, 86 S.Ct. at 1026; <em>see also Atlantic Sugar, Ltd. v. United States, </em>744 F.2d 1556, 1562 (Fed.Cir.1984); <em>SSIH, </em>718 F.2d at 381, 218 USPQ at 691 (additional views of Judge Nies); <em>Bally/Midway, </em>714 F.2d at 1125, 219 USPQ at 103 (uncontra-dicted evidence established injury).</p>\n<p id=\"b1618-6\">With these considerations in mind, we turn to Coming\u2019s arguments which, it asserts, warrant overturning the ITC\u2019s determination that Sumitomo\u2019s imports have no effect or tendency to substantially injure the domestic industries operating under Coming\u2019s patents.</p>\n<p id=\"b1618-7\">IV.</p>\n<p id=\"b1618-8\">\n<em>Section 337 Standard of Injury</em>\n</p>\n<p id=\"AaW\">A.</p>\n<p id=\"b1618-9\">Corning argues that the Commission erred, as a matter of law, in interpreting the statutory injury requirement. The test for determining injury in a patent-based section 337 action, per Corning, is whether the acts of the infringer have resulted or will result in \u201cconceivable losses of sales.\u201d The argument made by Corning here is a familiar refrain. A similar argument was made, for example, in <em>Textron, Inc. v. U.S. International Trade Commission, </em>753 F.2d 1019, 224 USPQ 625 (Fed.Cir.1985), where, despite a finding of infringement of a registered trademark in the importation and sale of certain goods, no exclusion order was issued because of a negative injury determination. In essence, owners of rights in. patents, trademarks and copyrights have argued, as Corning does, that infringement of such rights inevitably has the effect or tendency to substantially injure its business by reason of loss of sales or lower profits since its rights are exclusive, and that no further inquiry into the statutory requirement for injury is necessary or appropriate.</p>\n<p id=\"b1618-11\">In affirming the Commission\u2019s interpretation that satisfaction of the statutory injury requirement did not automatically follow from proof of infringement of rights in intellectual property, this court held in <em>Tex-tron:</em></p>\n<blockquote id=\"b1618-12\">Contrary to Textron\u2019s assertion, section 337 does not function merely as the international extension of our patent, trademark and copyright laws. <em>See In-the-Ear Hearing Aids, </em>Tariff Commission Pub. No. 182 at 28 (July 1966). Instead, section 337 has consistently been interpreted to contain a distinct injury requirement of independent proof. <em>Id. </em>Congress may well have included this separate requirement in the original 1930 version of section 337 to insure that the extreme and internationally provocative remedy contemplated therein \u2014 exclusion of imports from particular countries\u2014 would be implemented only when this is compelled by strong economic reasons. <em>See, e.g., </em>S.Rep. No. 93-1298, 93rd Cong., 2d Sess. 199 (1974); <em>reprinted in </em>1974 <em>U.S. Code Cong. &amp; Ad:News </em>7186, 7331. Although the contemplated range of remedies was expanded by the Trade Act of 1974 to include \u201csofter\u201d sanctions such as cease-and-desist orders, Congress has never altered the statute\u2019s injury requirement. In fact, Congress expressly rejected a Nixon Administration attempt to <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"1567\">*1567</page-number>eliminate the injury requirement in its proposed Trade Reform Act of 1973. <em>See </em>H. Kaye, <em>et al., International Trade Practice </em>\u00a7 6.05 n. 1 (1984).</blockquote>\n<p id=\"b1619-7\">753 F.2d at 1028-29, 224 USPQ at 631-32; <em>accord Warner Brothers, Inc. v. U.S. International Trade Commission, </em>787 F.2d 562, 564, 229 USPQ 126, 127 (Fed.Cir.1986) (no injury found notwithstanding copyright infringement).</p>\n<p id=\"b1619-8\">Because section 337 does not function merely as an international extension of private rights under the patent statute, the statements of this court on the showing of injury required for the grant of an injunction in a patent infringement suit cannot be taken out of context and applied to the issuance of an exclusion order in a section 337 proceeding. Upon a patentee\u2019s proof of continuing infringement of a valid enforceable patent, \u201cimmediate irreparable harm is presumed\u201d in connection with a request to a district court for injunctive relief. <em>Smith International, Inc. v. Hughes Tool Co., </em>718 F.2d 1573, 1581, 219 USPQ 686, 692-93 (Fed.Cir.), <em>cert. denied, </em>464 U.S. 996, 104 S.Ct. 493, 78 L.Ed.2d 687 (1983). Congress has, however, required more for an exclusion order against imports, as recognized by this court unequivocally in <em>Textron. </em>The Commission is, thus, correct in its statement, \u201c[S]ection 337 has elements in addition to the establishment of the existence of unfair practices such as patent infringement which must be satisfied before relief [i.e., an exclusion order] can be granted.\u201d <em>In re Certain Optical Waveguide Fibers, </em>slip op. at 21.</p>\n<p id=\"b1619-9\">Corning cannot be faulted in its analysis that a patentee is entitled to benefit from all sales in the United States of products covered by its patent and that diversion of any sales by an infringer without payment of royalties is legally and in fact an economic loss to the patentee. However, a section 337 proceeding is not designed simply to protect a patent owner from loss. That truism is readily apparent from the statutory scheme which provides no protection for a patent owner in the absence of a domestic industry. The pat-entee in that situation suffers a real loss from infringing imports, at least to the extent of the loss of possible royalties, but is relegated to private remedies.</p>\n<p id=\"b1619-13\">There is no question here that there is a domestic industry. However, to accept proof of a conceivable or actual loss of sales or profits of any amount by the patentee as sufficient proof of an effect or tendency to <em>substantially </em>injure the domestic industry would eliminate the \u201cindependent proof\u201d of the \u201cdistinct injury requirement\u201d held to be necessary in <em>Tex-tron. </em>Even if one equates the patent owner with the domestic industry, the statutory injury provision speaks not of <em>any </em>injury but of an effect or tendency \u201cto destroy or substantially injure.\u201d Clearly, Coming\u2019s argument that, as a matter of law, proof of even a single lost sale of a patented item establishes a sufficient level of injury must be rejected. Congress has directed that the remedy of section 337, involving as it does the act of the sovereign in closing our borders to certain imports, be exercised only in those instances where at least there is proof of a tendency to <em>substantially </em>injure the subject industry.</p>\n<p id=\"b1619-14\">In <em>In re Von Clemm, </em>229 F.2d 441, 444-45, 108 USPQ 371, 373-74 (CCPA 1955), the Court of Customs and Patent Appeals, a predecessor of this court,<footnotemark>6</footnotemark> approved the Commission\u2019s interpretation that a section 337 violation could be found based solely on the likelihood of future injury, that is, despite a finding that imports had had no \u201ceffect\u201d on the industry at the time of the investigation. Thus, the Commission was correct in making a separate inquiry in this case with respect to the likelihood of future injury even though the record did not support a finding of past injury. A patent owner need not suffer actual past injury from infringing imports before pursuing the relief afforded by section 337. On the other hand, where the asserted injury is based on projections of future injury, <em>i.e., </em>on a \u201ctendency\u201d to sub-</p>\n<p id=\"ar0-dedup-0\"><page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"1568\">*1568</page-number>stantially injure, the record must establish the existence of relevant conditions or circumstances from which probable future substantial injury can reasonably be inferred. In <em>Von Clemm, </em>the Commission found such circumstances on the record before it and the court affirmed that finding under the substantial evidence standard. <em>Id. </em>at 443, 108 USPQ at 372. The significance of the case is the approval of the dual injury inquiry. No legal standard with respect to the threshold of injury required to establish a \u201ctendency\u201d to substantially injure is set forth.<footnotemark>7</footnotemark></p>\n<p id=\"b1620-4\">The argument is made here that in <em>Bally/Midway, </em>this court adopted the standard that unfair methods or acts that result in even \u201cconceivable losses of sales\u201d establish injury to the domestic industry.<footnotemark>8</footnotemark> That precise argument was also made in <em>Textron </em>and firmly rejected. <em>Textron, </em>753 F.2d at 1028, 224 USPQ at 631. Even if this panel had the inclination to accept Coming\u2019s argument, we are bound by the court\u2019s holding in <em>Textron. See Kimberly-Clark Corp. v. Fort Howard Paper Co., </em>772 F.2d 860, 863, 227 USPQ 36, 37 (Fed.Cir.1985).</p>\n<p id=\"b1620-5\">B.</p>\n<p id=\"b1620-6\">While Coming\u2019s proposed \u201ctest\u201d for injury may be easily rejected as statutorily impermissible, it would be difficult to articulate positively what quantum of injury is legally required. Indeed, the question of quantum of injury is not one on which it would be appropriate for this court to put forth a legal standard. The statement in <em>Textron </em>that \u201cthe infringer holds, or threatens to hold, a significant share of the domestic market in the covered articles or has made a significant amount of sales of the articles\u201d gives guidance, but it is not definitive of the considerations relevant to the injury inquiry.</p>\n<p id=\"b1620-11\">In any event, determination of injury is precisely the type of question for which the Commission has the expertise and has been given the responsibility to answer. Moreover, the determination of injury necessarily must be based upon the particular facts of each case.<footnotemark>9</footnotemark> In view of these considerations, the appropriate function of this court is to review an injury determination to decide whether substantial evidence supports the facts relied on and whether the Commissioner\u2019s determination, on the record, is arbitrary, capricious, or an abuse of discretion. In other words, we must decide \u201cwhether the decision was based on a consideration of the relevant factors and whether there has been a clear error of judgment.\u201d <em>Citizens to Preserve Overton Park, Inc. v. Volpe, </em>401 U.S. 402, 416, 91 S.Ct. 814, 823, 28 L.Ed.2d 136 (1971). \u201cAlthough this inquiry into the facts is to be searching and careful, the ultimate standard of review is a narrow one. The court is not empowered to substitute its judgment for that of the agency.\u201d <em>Id.</em></p>\n<p id=\"b1621-3\"><page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"1569\">*1569</page-number>V.</p>\n<p id=\"b1621-4\">Turning to Coming\u2019s arguments that past injury was proved,<footnotemark>10</footnotemark> Corning asserts that Sumitomo\u2019s past sales have caused substantial injury because the amount of Sumitomo\u2019s sales has totalled several million dollars. Corning asserts that this amount <em>ipso facto </em>meets the \u201ctest\u201d of <em>Textron </em>that an injury is shown where sales are of a \u201csignificant amount.\u201d As indicated above, the amount of sales is highly relevant to the injury determination; however, whether the amount is \u201csignificant\u201d cannot be determined by the dollar amount <em>in vacuo. </em>\u201cSignificant\u201d requires some further inquiry once the amount of sales is found. Coming\u2019s comparison of the dollar amount of Sumitomo\u2019s sales to Spec-Tran\u2019s investment in its plant and to ITT\u2019s profit figures is unpersuasive as a basis for deciding whether the amount of the infringing sales is \u201csignificant.\u201d Conversely, the AU\u2019s comparison of Sumitomo\u2019s sales with the total sales of fiber in the U.S. market, as well as with the volume of sales of Corning and its domestic licensees, is meaningful and the conclusion that Sumitomo\u2019s sales were <em>de minimis </em>in those contexts is rational. Thus, there is no basis for holding that this part of the Commission\u2019s decision is arbitrary or capricious.</p>\n<p id=\"b1621-5\">Corning asserts that a more lenient standard of injury or a lesser quantum of proof should be required for \u201cnewly emerging, high technology industries\u201d than for stable, mature industries. In such new industries, \u201cexcess demand over supply\u201d and \u201cdeclining prices\u201d are normal growth patterns, per Corning, and should not give Sumitomo \u201ca right to take advantage of rising demand to make inroads into the U.S. markets and to establish customer/supplier relationships which ultimately enable Sumito-mo to seize a bigger share of the market as that market matures.\u201d Also, Corning argues, lost sales retard the patentee\u2019s growth, the patentee\u2019s recoupment of research and development costs and its achievement of full efficient operation. These are, of course, valid propositions, but they do not answer the question whether the sales by Sumitomo were so significant that they have had any of those effects. In this connection, the AU found not only that the domestic industry did not decline but also that Corning and its licensees could not satisfy demand for the product, despite increasing their capacities; that they had put customers on allocation; and, indeed, that they were themselves importing fiber in order to fill orders. Thus, the AU could not say that a sale by Sumitomo represented a lost sale to the domestic industry. In addition, the presence of non-licensed United States producers of fiber and of a licensed foreign producer (NTL) whose products were permitted by Corning to be sold in the United States by its subsidiary (NTI), also tended to negate Coming\u2019s position that Sumitomo\u2019s sales and market share were gained at the expense of the <em>domestic </em>industry. Thus, the evidence, per the AU, did not establish a nexus between Sumitomo\u2019s sales and any past injury to the domestic industry.</p>\n<p id=\"b1621-8\">Corning argues that NTI/NTL were placed on the wrong side of the injury equation \u2014 that their licensed sales are part of the domestic industry even though the product is manufactured abroad. The Commission\u2019s interpretation that only operations within the United States constitute the domestic industry is reasonable and is supported by the precedent of this court.<footnotemark>11</footnotemark> <em>Schaper Manufacturing Co. v. U.S. International Trade Commission, </em>717 F.2d 1368, 1370, 219 USPQ 665, 667 (Fed.Cir.1983) and cases cited therein. Any other view would mean that a patent owner could merely license the importation of products from abroad and claim injury within the meaning of section 337 to exclude unlicensed imports, despite having contributed little or nothing in the way of opportunities for employment of our industrial workers, <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"1570\">*1570</page-number>one of the stated objectives of the Tariff Act of 1930. Tariff Act of 1930, ch. 497, preamble, Title III, 46 Stat. 590 (1930) (\u201cAn Act To ... encourage the industries of the United States, to protect American labor....\u201d) Moreover, we reject Coming\u2019s argument that <em>Schaper </em>is distinguishable on the ground that the foreign manufacturer and U.S. distributor would constitute only part, not the entirety of the domestic industry. The Commission held otherwise and the distinction appears to us to be a difference without significance. Thus, we uphold the Commission\u2019s refusal to include the capacity of the licensed Canadian manufacturer in considering the ability of the <em>domestic industry </em>to meet demand or the loss of sales of imported goods by NTI.</p>\n<p id=\"b1622-5\">Corning argues that competitors who allegedly infringe its patents also constitute part of the domestic industry operating under its patents, and, thus, their loss of sales should have been taken into account in determining past injury. However, the Commission is not in a position to try a multiplicity of infringement actions against <em>domestic </em>producers as part of an investigation into unfair trade practices in the importation of goods. On the record here, its decision to exclude the alleged domestic infringers from the domestic industry operating <em>under </em>the patent is not arbitrary or capricious. Nor has this factor, which \u201ccomplicated\u201d the evaluation of injury, been shown to be decisive in any way.</p>\n<p id=\"b1622-6\">Similarly, other factors specifically mentioned by the ALJ, <em>e.g., </em>the aggressive pricing policy of other, much larger, licensed competitors, were seen as the cause of the reduction of domestic prices of optical fiber. While noting three isolated instances in which Sumitomo had underbid a cable competitor on a particular contract, (Sumitomo was not uniformly the low bidder), the AU found that such isolated instances would not have caused the massive nationwide, across-the-board price reductions in the domestic industry. That finding is supported by substantial evidence.</p>\n<p id=\"b1622-10\">Corning also claims injury by loss of royalties from Sumitomo. This is rather a transparent attempt to clothe in different garb the argument that patent infringement <em>per se </em>constitutes injury. Also, we must note that the damage here, assuming infringement, is not a total loss of royalties but deferment of payment. The record indicates that Corning is pursuing an infringement action against Sumitomo. Civil Action No. 84 Civ. 9155 (S.D.N.Y.).<footnotemark>12</footnotemark> Coming\u2019s coffers will be justly enriched by damages no less than a reasonable royalty if it is successful in that action. 35 U.S.C. \u00a7 284 (1982).</p>\n<p id=\"b1622-11\">VI.</p>\n<p id=\"b1622-12\">With respect to Sumitomo\u2019s sales having a tendency to substantially injure the domestic industry in the future, the only projected major change in circumstances foreseen by the Commission was Sumito-mo\u2019s expected production of optical fiber in the United States at its SERT facility in North Carolina beginning in mid-to-late <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"1571\">*1571</page-number>1985.<footnotemark>13</footnotemark> The expected capacity from that plant is projected to exceed five times the amount sold by Sumitomo between 1980-1984. Corning argues first that SERT and Sumitomo\u2019s imports will have a \u201csynergistic relationship \u2014 imports spurring SERT sales and SERT increasing imports.\u201d Corning also points to evidence of an \u201cunderstanding\u201d between SERT and a prospective purchaser of cabled fiber which it claims would not have come about had Sumitomo \u201cnot proven itself to [the customer] through past sales.\u201d Finally, it is argued that, as a result of Sumitomo\u2019s sales and marketing efforts in the United States to date, Sumitomo has unfairly gained a \u201ctoe-hold\u201d in the domestic market from which it can more easily increase its share in the future.</p>\n<p id=\"b1623-4\">The Commission considered the first argument unsupported by evidence and Corning merely urges us to adopt its view, which we decline to do. The Commission refused to consider the evidence of prospective sales by SERT, holding that \u201conly sales of imports ... can be taken into account in finding a tendency to substantially injure.\u201d We find this interpretation of the statutory injury requirement reasonable. Further, no error is shown in the findings that any increase in Sumitomo\u2019s market share would be largely attributable to Sumitomo\u2019s SERT facility.</p>\n<p id=\"b1623-5\">VII.</p>\n<p id=\"b1623-6\">Numerous additional disagreements with the Commission\u2019s factual findings appear in appellant\u2019s brief with citations to evidence to the contrary in the record. No attempt is made, however, by Coming\u2019s counsel, to meet its burden on appeal of showing that a particular finding is unsupported by substantial evidence, that is, that no reasonable person could make the particular finding considering the evidence offered by <em>both </em>sides.<footnotemark>14</footnotemark> Rather than dismiss these factual challenges out of hand because of the inadequacies of their presentation, the court has attempted to review the voluminous record on its own. Not only does it impose on the time of the court to have to engage in this exercise, but also the chances of a successful appeal are diminished. The court cannot ever become as familiar with the record as counsel for the parties.<footnotemark>15</footnotemark></p>\n<p id=\"b1623-10\">In any event, the factual challenges of Corning not specifically addressed herein have been considered. All findings are affirmed, appellant not having carried its burden on appeal of persuading this court that any findings are unsupported by substantial evidence.</p>\n<p id=\"b1623-11\">Finally, Coming\u2019s assertion of procedural error in that the Commission refused to consider post-hearing evidence is meritless.</p>\n<p id=\"b1623-12\">VIII.</p>\n<p id=\"b1623-13\">\n<em>Conclusion</em>\n</p>\n<p id=\"b1623-14\">The factors considered by the Commission in its determination of no injury in this investigation are relevant. Its findings are supported by substantial evidence. None of the usual indices of injury, <em>e.g., </em>declines in sales, production, investment, profits, or employment, are present. Similarly, its evaluation of the future levels of imports and their likely effect is amply supported by the record.</p>\n<p id=\"b1623-15\">As the Commission stated, its decision here does not sanction the infringement of <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"1572\">*1572</page-number>U.S. patents by importers, nor does the affirmance by this court. This court, which hears all appeals in both civil infringement actions and section 337 investigations, cannot ignore that Congress established different standards for injunctions and for exclusion orders.</p>\n<p id=\"b1624-4\">The determination of the International Trade Commission that no violation of section 337 resulted from the importation from Japan and sale in this country of certain optical waveguide fibers by Sumito-mo is affirmed. The patent issues being mooted by affirmance on the grounds of no injury, we vacate the portion of the Commission\u2019s decision dealing with those issues.</p>\n<p id=\"b1624-5\">AFFIRMED IN PART; VACATED IN PART.</p>\n<footnote label=\"1\">\n<p id=\"b1614-10\">. 19 U.S.C. \u00a7 1337(a) provides:</p>\n<blockquote id=\"b1614-11\">(a) <em>Unfair methods of competition declared unlawful.</em></blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b1614-12\">Unfair methods of competition and unfair acts in the importation of articles into the United States, or in their sale by the owner, importer, consignee, or agent of either, the <em>effect or tendency of which is to destroy or substantially injure an industry, </em>efficiently and economically operated, in the United States, or to prevent the establishment of such an industry, or to restrain or monopolize trade and commerce in the United States, are declared unlawful, and when found by the Commission to exist shall be dealt with, in addition to any other provisions of law, as provided in this section.
