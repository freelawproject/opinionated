Riles, is scheduled to be executed on September 17, 1986 for a murder he committed in 1974. Having had his motions for a certificate of probable cause to appeal and stay of execution denied by the district court, Riles moves this Court for the same relief. Having heard oral argument on the motions, the Court finds that there has been no substantial showing by Riles of a denial of a federal right, and his motion for a certificate of probable cause is therefore DENIED.</p>\n<p id=\"b1024-21\">I. FACTS</p>\n<p id=\"b1024-22\">On December 11, 1974, Riles robbed and shot thirty-one year-old John Thomas Henry.<footnotemark>1</footnotemark> Two days later, Henry died and Riles was charged with his murder. Riles was subsequently tried before a jury, convicted of capital murder, and sentenced to death. Upon appeal, the conviction was reversed and the case remanded for a new trial. <em>Riles v. State, </em>557 S.W.2d 95, 99 (Tex.Crim. App.1977). The second trial also resulted in Riles\u2019s conviction for capital murder; <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"949\">*949</page-number>punishment again was death. Appeal of the second conviction, however, was not met with success. <em>Riles v. State, </em>595 S.W.2d 858 (Tex.Crim.App.1980) (en banc). Thereafter, Riles sought indirect relief via a writ of habeas corpus in the state trial court and Texas Court of Criminal Appeals, but both applications were denied.</p>\n<p id=\"b1025-4\">Having exhausted his state remedies, Riles applied for a writ of habeas corpus in the United States District Court for the Southern District of Texas, and its denial precipitates this appeal. In support of his current motions for a certificate of probable cause and a stay of execution, Riles asserts several grounds of error.</p>\n<p id=\"b1025-5\">II. CERTIFICATE OF PROBABLE CAUSE</p>\n<p id=\"b1025-7\">Before Riles can prosecute his appeal in this court, he must obtain a certificate of probable cause. Fed.R.App.P. 22(b). <em>Barefoot v. Estelle, </em>463 U.S. 880, 893, 103 S.Ct. 3383, 3394, 77 L.Ed.2d 1090 (1983). The district court has already denied Riles a certificate, and unless he is able to establish a \u201csubstantial showing of the denial of [a] federal right,\u201d we will also deny his motion for the certificate. <em>Barefoot, </em>463 U.S. at 893, 103 S.Ct. at 3394 (quoting <em>Stewart v. Beto, </em>454 F.2d 268, 270 n. 2 (5th Cir.1971), <em>cert. denied, </em>406 U.S. 925, 92 S.Ct. 1796, 32 L.Ed.2d 126 (1972)). To make his showing, Riles \u201cmust demonstrate that the issues are debatable among jurists of reason; that a court could resolve the issues [in a different manner]; or that the questions are \u2018adequate to deserve encouragement to proceed further.\u2019 \u201d <em>Id. </em>at 893 n. 4, 103 S.Ct. at 3394-95 n. 4 (quoting <em>Gordon v. Willis, </em>516 F.Supp. 911, 913 (N.D.Ga.1980) (emphasis in original)).</p>\n<p id=\"b1025-17\">III. EXCLUSION OF VENIRE-MEMBERS.</p>\n<p id=\"b1025-18\">Riles\u2019s first complaint concerns the state trial court\u2019s decision to exclude for cause two veniremembers- because of their views on capital punishment. The first veniremember excused by the court admitted that his deliberations would be influenced by a possible death sentence, and that given a choice, he would choose a sentence other than death.<footnotemark>2</footnotemark></p>\n<p id=\"b1025-19\">The other excluded veniremember, Ms. Simpson, unequivocally stated that she could not impose capital punishment for a murder that occurred during the course of an armed robbery. In fact, anything short of a brutal \u201cbutcher\u201d of a victim would result in her answering the special verdicts in such a way so as to defeat a penalty of death.<footnotemark>3</footnotemark></p>\n<p id=\"b1026-3\"><page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"950\">*950</page-number>Riles contends that the standards for exclusion of prospective jurors announced in <em>Adams v. Texas, </em>448 U.S. 38, 100 S.Ct. 2521, 65 L.Ed.2d 581 (1980) and <em>WitheRSpoon v. Illinois, </em>391 U.S. 510, 88 S.Ct. 1770, 20 L.Ed.2d 776 (1968) should be applied over those set out in <em>Wainwright v. Witt, </em>469 U.S. 412, 105 S.Ct. 844, 83 L.Ed.2d 841 (1985). This argument is unpersuasive, because the Supreme Court in <em>Witt </em>merely clarified <em>Witherspoon </em>and reaffirmed <em>Adams </em>as the proper standard to use when considering the exclusion of a potential juror. <em>Wicker v. McCotter, </em>783 F.2d 487, 493 (5th Cir.1986), <em>cert. denied, </em>\u2014 U.S. -, 106 S.Ct. 3310, 92 L.Ed.2d 723 (1986). There is no inconsistency among the tests. <em>Adams </em>prohibits a veniremember from being challenged for cause due to his views on the death penalty \u201cunless those views would prevent or substantially impair the performance of his duties as a juror in accordance with his instructions and his oath.\u201d <em>Adams, </em>448 U.S. at 45, 100 S.Ct. at 2526. Here, both veniremembers unequivocally stated that they could not perform their duties impartially in accordance with the court\u2019s instructions. Given these veniremembers\u2019 principles, they would have been unable to satisfactorily perform their duties as jurors.</p>\n<p id=\"b1026-22\">Further support for this conclusion arises from the deference and presumption of correctness afforded to a state court\u2019s factfindings concerning exclusion of potential jurors. <em>Wainwright v. Witt, </em>469 U.S. at 426-30, 105 S.Ct. at 853-55. Reviewing the two veniremembers\u2019 testimony and the state court\u2019s decision to exclude these individuals from the jury in this light, it is evident that Riles has failed to make a \u201csubstantial showing of the denial of [a] federal right\u201d with respect to this particular issue.<footnotemark>4</footnotemark></p>\n<p id=\"b1027-4\"><page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"951\">*951</page-number>IV. VOIR DIRE EXAMINATION OF THE JURY</p>\n<p id=\"b1027-5\">Riles complains that the voir dire examination was conducted in such a manner that the State\u2019s burden of proof on the punishment issue was significantly reduced. Specifically, Riles alleges that the trial court stressed the proof needed to support the aggravating circumstances and disregarded the effect of possible mitigating evidence. By so doing, he contends, the court committed a number of the jurors in advance to return affirmative answers on the two punishment issues.</p>\n<p id=\"b1027-6\">Because Riles failed to object to the state trial court\u2019s lengthy and comprehensive voir dire, and because Riles\u2019s counsel was given an opportunity to conduct his own examination of the jurors (thus allowing him to cure any prejudice created by the court), the district court, relying on <em>Wainwright v. Sykes, </em>433 U.S. 72, 97 S.Ct. 2497, 53 L.Ed.2d 594 (1977), denied federal habeas review on this issue.</p>\n<p id=\"b1027-7\">We agree with the district court\u2019s decision. In Texas, a party must voice his objection to the conduct he considers erroneous at the time it occurs. \u201cFailure to object waives error, if any, that is presented.\u201d <em>Eg. Green v. State, </em>682 S.W.2d 271, 275 (Tex.Crim.App.1984), <em>cert. denied, </em>470 U.S. 1034, 105 S.Ct. 1407, 84 L.Ed.2d 794 (1985), By failing to object timely during voir dire to the instructions or questions he deemed inappropriate, Riles is barred from federal habeas review on this issue \u201cabsent a showing of \u2018cause\u2019 and \u2018prejudice.\u2019 \u201d <em>Sykes, </em>433 U.S. at 87, 97 S.Ct. at 2506.</p>\n<p id=\"b1027-8\">\u201c[C]ause for a procedural default must ordinarily turn on whether the prisoner can show that some objective factor external to the defense impeded counsel\u2019s efforts to comply with the State\u2019s procedural rule.\u201d <em>Murray v. Carrier, </em>\u2014 U.S. -, 106 S.Ct. 2639, 2646, 91 L.Ed.2d 397 (1986). Other than Riles\u2019s claim of ineffective assistance of counsel, which is discussed in Section VII, <em>infra, </em>of this opinion, there is nothing in the record which would establish cause for the default. Riles does not even allege that any external factor hindered or prevented him from complying with the contemporaneous objection rule.</p>\n<p id=\"b1027-15\">Application of the procedural default rule is particularly appropriate to an alleged error in voir dire because, if an error is then made, it may readily be corrected before a jury is empanelled. Moreover, no objection is made to the court\u2019s instructions to the jury in this regard, and the jury\u2019s oath requires them to return a verdict in accordance with those instructions, not the preliminary examination. If despite the procedural default bar to Riles\u2019s voir dire challenge, we reached the issue, we would find that the examination conducted by the state trial court did not deprive Riles of any constitutional right. As part of the voir dire examination, courts in Texas are required by statute to \u201cpropound to the entire panel of prospective jurors questions concerning the principles, as applicable to the case on trial, of reasonable doubt, burden of proof, return of indictment by grand jury, presumption of innocence, and opinion.\u201d Tex.Code Crim.Proc.Ann. art. 35.17, \u00a7 2 (Vernon Supp.1986). When reviewed as a whole, the record of the voir dire examination reveals the court\u2019s sincere attempts to comply with this statute; the court explained the standards involved in the case, the burdens of proof on the parties, and the insanity defense raised by Riles.</p>\n<p id=\"b1027-16\">Instead of looking at the record as a whole, however, Riles focuses on the court\u2019s attempts to explain the two issues submitted during the penalty phase of trial.<footnotemark>5</footnotemark> With respect to these two issues, how<page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"952\">*952</page-number>ever, the court did nothing more than explain the standards and provide the jury with guidelines to use in their deliberations. Riles has demonstrated nothing which would indicate the court abused its discretion in its examination. <em>See Milton v. Procunier, </em>744 F.2d 1091, 1096 (5th Cir.1984), ce<em>rt. denied, </em>471 U.S. 1030, 105 S.Ct. 2050, 85 L.Ed.2d 323 (1984); <em>Weaver v. State, </em>476 S.W.2d 326 (Tex.Crim.App.1972); <em>Cook v. State, </em>398 S.W.2d 284 (Tex.Crim.App.1965), cer<em>t. denied, </em>384 U.S. 966, 86 S.Ct. 1599, 16 L.Ed.2d 678 (1966).<footnotemark>6</footnotemark></p>\n<p id=\"b1028-5\">Because Riles failed to raise his challenge to the court\u2019s voir dire examination in a timely manner, it is waived. Even had he not waived this argument, he has made no substantial showing of the denial of a federal right as a result of the state trial court\u2019s voir dire examination.</p>\n<p id=\"b1028-6\">V. INSTRUCTIONS ON MITIGATING CIRCUMSTANCES AND CONSTITUTIONALITY OF TEX.CODE CRIM. PROC.ANN. ART. 37.071</p>\n<p id=\"b1028-7\">Riles unsuccessfully raised the insanity defense at trial. Riles now argues that even if the psychiatric evidence presented at trial was insufficient to convince the jury he was insane when he murdered Henry, it may have been sufficient to show he was mentally ill. Mental illness, according to Riles, is a mitigating factor which would have \u201cdiminished\u201d his criminal responsibility in the penalty phase of the trial. Even though he did not request an instruction on this mitigating factor during the penalty phase, it is Riles\u2019s belief that the trial court erred by failing to bring it to the jury\u2019s attention.<footnotemark>7</footnotemark></p>\n<p id=\"b1028-12\">A defendant will be \u201cbarred from raising his claim about the absence of a mitigating circumstance instruction\u201d if there is no request for such an instruction at trial or if a contemporaneous objection to the court\u2019s charge on this ground is not made. <em>O\u2019Bryan v. Estelle, </em>714 F.2d 365, 385 (5th Cir.1983), <em>cert. denied, </em>465 U.S. 1013, 104 S.Ct. 1015, 79 L.Ed.2d 245 (1984). <em>See also Wainwright v. Sykes, </em>433 U.S. 72, 97 S.Ct. 2497, 53 L.Ed.2d 594 (1977), and Tex.Code Crim.Proc.Ann. arts. 36.14, 36.15 (Vernon Supp.1986). Under <em>Sykes, </em>Riles was required to establish \u201ccause\u201d for the procedural default, and he has not done this. <em>Id. </em>at 90-91, 97 S.Ct. at 2508.</p>\n<p id=\"b1028-13\">Riles also asserts a constitutional challenge to Article 37.071, stating that, as applied to his case, it prevented the jury from considering his mental illness as a mitigating factor. In a case factually similar to this one, this Court has found article <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"953\">*953</page-number>37.071 in compliance with the Eighth and Fourteenth Amendments. <em>Granviel v. Estelle, </em>655 F.2d 673, 675 (5th Cir.1981), ce<em>rt. denied, </em>455 U.S. 1003, 102 S.Ct. 1636, 71 L.Ed.2d 870 (1982). The Texas statute has previously withstood constitutional attack in the Supreme Court. <em>Jurek v. Texas, </em>428 U.S. 262, 276, 96 S.Ct. 2950, 2958, 49 L.Ed.2d 929 (1976). In fact, the Supreme Court held that \u201c[b]y authorizing the defense to bring before the jury at the separate sentencing hearing whatever mitigating circumstances relating to the individual defendant can be adduced, Texas has ensured that the sentencing jury will have adequate guidance to enable it to perform its sentencing function.\u201d <em>Id.</em></p>\n<p id=\"b1029-6\">The trial court never <em>prevented </em>Riles from re-urging evidence of mental illness to mitigate the penalty. Indeed, the trial court instructed the jury that they could consider <em>all </em>evidence submitted during <em>both </em>phases of the trial when answering the penalty issues. Record at 140. Moreover, there is nothing in the record which indicates the jury failed or refused to consider any of the considerable evidence in the guilt phase record with respect to mental illness. Failure of the trial court to give a specific instruction on mental illness did not rise to a constitutional error.</p>\n<p id=\"b1029-7\">VI. PSYCHIATRIC TESTIMONY</p>\n<p id=\"b1029-8\">To support his insanity defense, Riles offered expert testimony of several experts who diagnosed a history of psychosis and schizophrenia and purported to demonstrate that Riles was insane when he committed the murder in 1974. In rebuttal, the state\u2019s experts offered an \u201calternate diagnosis\u201d for Riles\u2019s behavior \u2014 that he was a sociopath, one suffering from a personality disorder, not insanity.</p>\n<p id=\"b1029-9\">Riles first argues that the rights guaranteed him under the Fifth and Sixth Amendments were abridged under the standards set forth in <em>Estelle v. Smith, </em>451 U.S. 454, 101 S.Ct. 1866, 68 L.Ed.2d 359 (1981) because: (1) the state\u2019s medical experts interviewed him absent counsel; (2) he was not advised of his right to remain silent; and (3) he was not informed that the results of the interviews could be used against him.</p>\n<p id=\"b1029-12\">The district court noted Riles\u2019s failure to object at trial to the state\u2019s expert testimony and disposed of this complaint by applying the procedural default doctrine. <em>Wainwright v. Sykes, supra. </em>It has been brought to our attention, however, that in some post-Smith cases, the Texas courts have waived the procedural default theory. <em>Ex Parte Chambers, </em>688 S.W.2d 483, 484 (Tex.Crim.App.1985), <em>cert. denied, </em>\u2014 U.S. -, 106 S.Ct. 181, 88 L.Ed.2d 150 (1985). As will be discussed below, Riles\u2019s claim does not fit the <em>Smith </em>analysis. Moreover, Riles has not shown \u201ccause\u201d for this default which would overcome his procedural default. For these reasons, we approve the district court\u2019s decision to dispose of this claim under a procedural default theory-</p>\n<p id=\"b1029-15\">18,9] In any event, this case is distinguishable from <em>Smith, </em>where the prosecution introduced harmful psychiatric evidence during the punishment phase of the trial and the defendant had no clue, because he had never raised a defense of insanity, that such evidence would be introduced. The damaging testimony was based on an unrequested court-ordered psychiatric interview of the defendant conducted without the benefit of Miranda<footnotemark>8</footnotemark> warnings. Because advance notice as to the purpose of the examination was not provided to the defendant\u2019s counsel, the Court in <em>Smith </em>held that the defendant was also denied assistance of counsel in making a decision of whether to submit to the examination. Here, the record reflects that Riles, represented by counsel, requested most (if not all) of the psychiatric examinations, the results of which he now finds objectionable. Moreover, unlike the defendant in <em>Smith, </em>Riles raised the insanity defense; the state, therefore, had every right to rebut that defense. By pursuing this avenue of defense, and by offering psychiatric evidence to support this de<page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"954\">*954</page-number>fense, Riles opened the door to the state\u2019s evidence and waived his Fifth Amendment privilege against self-incrimination. <em>Vardas v. Estelle, </em>715 F.2d 206, 208 (5th Cir.1983), ce<em>rt. denied, </em>465 U.S. 1104, 104 S.Ct. 1603, 80 L.Ed.2d 133 (1984). Neither was Riles\u2019s Sixth Amendment right to assistance of counsel abridged. Finally, a defendant has \u201cno constitutional right to have his attorney present <em>during </em>the psychiatric examination.\u201d <em>Vardas, </em>715 F.2d at 209 (citing <em>United States v. Cohen, </em>530 F.2d 43, 48 (5th Cir.1976), <em>cert. denied, </em>429 U.S. 855, 97 S.Ct. 149, 50 L.Ed.2d 130 (1976) (emphasis added)).</p>\n<p id=\"b1030-4\">Riles\u2019s second objection to the state\u2019s psychiatric evidence involves the state\u2019s expert testimony given during the guilt/innocence phase of the trial. The state\u2019s experts described the characteristics of a sociopath and one expert testified that \u201cthis man is an extremely dangerous person who is a threat to society.\u201d Riles maintains that this testimony contributed to the jury\u2019s finding in the <em>penalty phase </em>that he \u201cwould constitute a continuing threat to society.\u2019,\u201d Tex.Code Crim.Proc. Ann. art. 37.071(b)(2) (Vernon Supp.1986). We observe however, that a state is free to offer an \u201calternative diagnosis\u201d for a defendant\u2019s behavior when an insanity defense is raised. <em>Vardas, </em>715 F.2d at 210. When offering this alternate diagnosis to explain a defendant\u2019s behavior, the state may demonstrate that the defendant\u2019s behavior conforms with the alternate diagnosis by offering a description of the disorder. <em>Id.</em></p>\n<p id=\"b1030-5\">VII. ASSISTANCE OF COUNSEL</p>\n<p id=\"b1030-6\">Riles finally argues that he was denied effective assistance of counsel during all stages of his trial (including voir dire examination, the guilt/innocence phase, and the punishment phase) and on appeal. Specifically, Riles maintains his counsel was ineffective because his attorneys neglected to:</p>\n<blockquote id=\"b1030-7\">(1) Raise on direct appeal the trial court\u2019s improper exclusion of venire-members. (See section III of this opinion, <em>supra).</em></blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b1030-9\">(2) Object to the trial court\u2019s improper and prejudicial voir dire examination during the examination and on appeal. (See section IV of this opinion, <em>supra).</em></blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b1030-10\">(3) Object to the introduction of the state\u2019s psychiatric evidence which was admitted in violation of <em>Estelle v. Smith, </em>451 U.S. 454, 101 S.Ct. 1866, 68 L.Ed.2d 359 (1981). (See section VI of this opinion, <em>supra).</em></blockquote>\n<p id=\"b1030-11\">All of these alleged omissions on the part of Riles\u2019s counsel involve procedural defaults either at trial or on appeal. As noted earlier in this opinion, habeas relief will be denied in a situation involving procedural default unless the defendant can demonstrate good cause for the default and actual resulting prejudice. <em>Wainwright v. Sykes, </em>433 U.S. 72, 90-91, 97 S.Ct. 2497, 2508, 53 L.Ed.2d 594 (1977). In <em>Murray v. Carrier, </em>\u2014 U.S.-, 106 S.Ct. 2639, 91 L.Ed.2d 397 (1986), the Supreme Court recently held that \u201cthe mere fact that counsel failed to recognize the factual or legal basis for a claim, or failed to raise the claim despite recognizing it, does not constitute cause for a procedural default.\u201d <em>Id. </em>at -, 106 S.Ct. at 2645-46. If, however, a defendant\u2019s counsel is constitutionally ineffective, such <em>will </em>constitute cause for a procedural default. <em>Id. </em>As a result, we must determine whether the performance of Riles\u2019s attorneys was constitutionally defective.</p>\n<p id=\"b1030-16\">The two-part constitutional standard governing effectiveness of counsel was announced in <em>Strickland v. Washington, </em>466 U.S. 668, 104 S.Ct. 2052, 80 L.Ed.2d 674 (1984). <em>Strickland </em>places on the defendant the burden of showing that counsel\u2019s performance was seriously deficient and such deficiency was so prejudicial as to deprive the defendant of a reliable result at trial.</p>\n<p id=\"b1030-17\">Having found each of the contentions asserted by Riles to be meritless irrespective of the procedural default, we cannot, consistently therewith, find incompetence of Riles\u2019s attorneys. <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"955\">*955</page-number>Similarly we find no error in the district court\u2019s denying Riles an evidentiary hearing on his ineffective assistance of counsel claim. A hearing is not required if it \u201cwould not produce further evidence in support of specific, nonconclusory allegations.\u201d <em>Celestine v. Blackburn, 750 </em>F.2d 353, 358 (5th Cir.1984). Riles has not demonstrated how a hearing would have aided either the district court or this Court.</p>\n<p id=\"b1031-5\">VIII. CONCLUSION</p>\n<p id=\"b1031-6\">We find no showing of a denial of a federal right which would entitle Riles to a certificate of probable cause to appeal; therefore, the petition for probable cause is DENIED. Accordingly, the motion for a stay of execution is DENIED, and this appeal is DISMISSED.</p>\n<p id=\"b1031-7\">ALVIN B. RUBIN, Circuit Judge, concurring:</p>\n<p id=\"b1031-8\">I concur in the opinion because, as a judge of an inferior court, I am bound by the decisions of the Supreme Court, and, as a judge of this court, I am bound by the law of this circuit. If I were free to do so, I would order an evidentiary hearing on the effectiveness of counsel. To me, a sufficient showing has been made that trial counsel did not provide this accused with the quality of defense essential to adequate representation in any serious felony case, and particularly in a capital case.</p>\n<p id=\"b1031-9\">It is probably true that any error made by court-appointed counsel in the guilt-innocence phase of the trial was harmless in the sense that it does not appear likely to have affected the result. The briefs and argument of current counsel, however, together with the record, indicate that, if Riles\u2019 trial counsel had been able, the jury might not have imposed the death penalty.</p>\n<p id=\"b1031-10\">Precedent requires me to agree that this is not enough to justify a certificate of probable cause. The Constitution, as interpreted by the courts, does not require that the accused, even in a capital case, be represented by able or effective counsel.

The colloquy between the court and venire-member, Mr. Nix, was as follows:</p>\n<blockquote id=\"b1025-11\">COURT: Let me ask it this way: Would the fact that you know that the death penalty is a possibility in the event of a finding of guilty of capital murder, would the fact that you now know that that is a possibility, would that affect your deliberation on any issue of fact throughout the case? Do you understand my question?</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b1025-12\">MR. NIX: I understand it, but it is not that easy to answer.</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b1025-13\">COURT: No, I know it is not easy. But it is just like this: On the one hand, you tell me that you have this religious scruple against the infliction of death as punishment for crime. So, what I am asking you is, if that is the case, would the fact that the death penalty is a possibility affect the way you would answer any question involved in this lawsuit, up to and including, let\u2019s say, on the guilt or innocence \u2014 might you find it murder instead of capital murder so you wouldn\u2019t be faced with the death penalty?</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"Adr\">MR. NIX: I am afraid I would have to say it would influence my way of thinking.</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"A8W\">COURT: And that is true regardless of the nature and character of the case? Regardless of how bad the case is?</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"AH9\">MR. NIX: Yes, I think so. It would still be in my mind, that it, that it would be to me, I would think I am doing wrong if I commit the guy.</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"apj-dedup-0\">COURT: We accept your feelings. Nobody is arguing with you. The only reason I am asking it in so many different ways is I must be absolutely sure that under no circumstances could you participate in a death penalty. If you had the choice, you would choose something less than death?</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"AkY\">MR.

The relevant voir dire of Ms. Simpson was:</p>\n<blockquote id=\"Ani\">COURT: If both of those questions are answered yes by the jury, that is a mandate to me to give him the death penalty. If either of those questions is answered no, this is a mandate to me to give him life in the penitentiary. Since <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"950\">*950</page-number>you have expressed your opposition to the death penalty as a punishment, I need to ask you this: If the State had proven beyond a reasonable doubt that each of these questions that I have just cited to you should be answered yes, could you and would you answer them yes, knowing that it would result in the death penalty?</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"arg-dedup-1\">A. No.</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"Ab8K\">COURT: You would be more than likely to answer one of them no, so it would be life imprisonment as opposed to the death penalty; is that correct statement?</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"aae-dedup-0\">A. Yes, sir.</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"ast-dedup-2\">COURT: And this is, I assume, true regardless of the crime that might be involved? In other words, a bloody and brutal crime is involved, would your answer still be the same?</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"ada-dedup-1\">A. No, I think I could change my mind then.</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"aeb-dedup-0\">COURT: All right. Then you are not opposed to the death penalty?</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"Abu\">A. Well, it depends, then, I guess on the facts.</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"Ar9\">COURT: Nothing unusual about that. So, if the facts were sufficient in your mind, you could vote for the death penalty. If, having heard the facts, you felt it was a proper punishment for the crime, you could vote for the death penalty; is that correct or not?</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"ArKB\">A. I think it depends on the type of crime.</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"afh-dedup-0\">A. Yes, exactly what the defendant did.</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"AlKh\">COURT: Well, how about a murder committed during the course of a robbery? That is exactly what we are talking about.</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"aoe-dedup-1\">A.

Yes, sir.</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"Av8D\">COURT: And are you saying that in a case of \u2014 let's put it where it is a him. All right you are saying that in a case of murder during the course of a robbery, that unless somebody is butchered up, you could not find the death penalty; is that what you are telling me? A. Yes.</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"Az_n\">COURT: Regardless of any other facts?</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"A9Z\">A. Yes.</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"AvT1\">COURT: Let me ask it another way. Not that you know the death penalty is a possibility and that mandatory life or death is an absolute proposition in the event of a finding of guilty of capital murder, would that fact affect your deliberations on any issue of fact during the course of the trial?</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"akk-dedup-0\">A.

Riles failed to object at trial or on direct appeal to the exclusion of either veniremember. Under <em>Wainwright v. Sykes, </em>433 U.S. 72, 97 S.Ct. 2497, 53 L.Ed.2d 594 (1977) this failure to timely object bars Riles from now complaining of the trial court\u2019s conduct.

Riles selected a few excerpts from the entire voir dire examination to fortify his challenge. When these excerpts are viewed in context with the rest of the testimony, Riles\u2019s argument with respect to \"prejudice\" borders on frivolous. Riles distorts the \"prejudicial\" colloquy that supposedly passed between the court, prosecutor, and a juror. Riles\u2019s brief implies that one conversation in particular involved a juror when it in fact involved a conversation between the court, prosecutor, and Riles\u2019s attorney. Moreover, the particular conversation occurred because of a question posed by Riles\u2019s attorney to a veniremember who <em>was not even selected as a juror. </em>The conversation complained of involved the meaning of the term \"deliberate\u201d as used in the first special issue in the punishment stage of the trial. Contrary to Riles\u2019s version of the examination, the only statement made by the court in front of the veniremember was that the \u201ccourts have spoken on this issue [the distinction between the meaning of the words \"deliberate\" and \"intentional\"].\u201d Record at 2095-96.
