LEON HIGGINBOTHAM, Jr., Circuit Judge.</author>\n<p id=\"b199-12\">This is an appeal from a final judgment of the district court for Prince Macaroni of New Jersey, Inc. (\u201cPrince\u201d), dismissing the complaint of appellant Lynwood J.R. Herring. For the reasons that follow, we will reverse the judgment of the district court and remand for further proceedings.</p>\n<p id=\"b199-16\">I.</p>\n<p id=\"b199-17\">On March 8, 1983, appellant was injured in the course of his employment with Prince. Shortly thereafter, he began receiving worker\u2019s compensation benefits. Appellant alleges that on July 12, 1984, his doctor notified Prince that he could return to work as of August 1, 1984. On July 16, 1984, however, Prince sent appellant a telegram informing him that he had been discharged.</p>\n<p id=\"b199-18\">Throughout the period of his employment with Prince, appellant was a member of the Prince Employees\u2019 Union, and his relationship with Prince was governed by a series of collective bargaining agreements that provided that Prince could discharge employees for \u201cjust and proper cause.\u201d The collective bargaining agreement that came into effect on August 1, 1983 also provided that:</p>\n<blockquote id=\"b199-19\">An employee\u2019s seniority shall terminate and he shall no longer be considered an employee upon ...</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b199-20\">Absence of 12 consecutive months in the case of an industrial illness or accident arising out of or in the course of employment with the employer herein.</blockquote>\n<p id=\"b199-21\">Prince relied on this provision in discharging appellant. Appellant, however, brought this diversity suit alleging that he had been wrongfully discharged in retaliation for filing a worker\u2019s compensation claim, in violation of N.J.Stat.Ann. \u00a7 34:15-39.1 (Supp.1986).<footnotemark>1</footnotemark></p>\n<p id=\"b200-3\"><page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"122\">*122</page-number>That statute does not, by its terms, create a private cause of action for damages. For that appellant relied on the newly recognized New Jersey common law cause of action for wrongful discharge in violation of public policy. <em>See Pierce v. Ortho Pharmaceutical Corp., </em>84 N.J. 58, 417 A.2d 505 (1980). The district court predicted, however, that if presented with the question, the Supreme Court of New Jersey would hold that employees, like appellant, who are covered by collective bargaining agreements containing \u201cjust cause\u201d clauses, do not enjoy the common law right of action. The court went on to hold that appellant could not now proceed under \u00a7 301 of the Labor-Management Relations Act, because he had not exhausted his extra-judicial remedies. Accordingly, the district court dismissed the complaint. <em>Herring v. Prince Foods-Canning Div., </em>611 F.Supp. 177 (D.N.J.1985). This appeal followed.</p>\n<p id=\"b200-4\">II.</p>\n<p id=\"b200-5\">In <em>Pierce v. Ortho Pharmaceutical Corp., supra, </em>the Supreme Court of New Jersey considered \u201cwhether we should adopt an exception to the rule allowing an employer to discharge an at will employee without cause.\u201d 84 N.J. at 61, 417 A.2d at 506. That case involved a medical doctor who was employed at will as Director of Medical Research/Therapeutics by a pharmaceutical concern, and who objected to working on development of a product containing saccharin. She alleged that she was entitled to damages for the termination of her employment because:</p>\n<blockquote id=\"b200-6\">The Defendant, its agents, servants and employees requested and demanded Plaintiff follow a course of action and behavior which was impossible for Plaintiff to follow because of the Hippocratic oath she had taken, because of the ethical standards by which she was governed as a physician, and because of the regulatory schemes, both federal and state, statutory and case law, for the protection of the public in the field of health and human well-being, which schemes Plaintiff believed she should honor.</blockquote>\n<p id=\"b200-7\">84 N.J. at 64, 417 A.2d 508 (quoting the complaint).</p>\n<p id=\"b200-8\">The <em>Pierce </em>opinion surveys in some detail the rise and fall of the employment at will rule, 84 N.J. at 65-70, with particular attention to the recent recognition by many states of a \u201ccommon law cause of action <em>for employees at will </em>who were discharged for reasons that were in some way \u2018wrongful.\u2019\u201d 84 N.J. at 67, 417 A.2d at 509 (emphasis added). The court observed that \u201c[f]ormerly there was a clear delineation between employers, who frequently were owners of their own businesses, and employees. The employer in the old sense has been replaced by a superior in the corporate hierarchy who is himself an employee. We are a nation of employees. Growth in the number of employees has been accompanied by increasing recognition of the need for stability in labor relations.\u201d 84 N.J. at 66, 417 A.2d at 509. Noting the capacity of the common law to adapt to current needs, the <em>Pierce </em>court held:</p>\n<blockquote id=\"b200-9\">The interests of employees, employers, and the public lead to the conclusion that the common law of New Jersey should limit the right of an employer to fire an employee at will.</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b200-10\">... Employees have an interest in knowing they will not be discharged for exercising their legal rights. Employers have an interest in knowing they can run their businesses as they see fit as long as their conduct is consistent with public policy. The public has an interest in employment stability and in discouraging frivolous lawsuits by dissatisfied employees.</blockquote>\n<p id=\"b200-11\">84 N.J. at 71, 417 A.2d at 511. Thus, the court held that wrongfully discharged employees have a cause of action in both contract and tort, with punitive damages available under the latter theory. 84 N.J. at 72, 417 A.2d at 512. The court went on to dismiss Pierce\u2019s wrongful discharge claim, holding that she had failed to demonstrate that the research she refused to undertake was violative of any \u201cclear mandate of public policy.\u201d 84 N.J. at 76, 417 A.2d at 514.</p>\n<p id=\"b201-3\"><page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"123\">*123</page-number>The district court recognized that <em>Pierce </em>was distinguishable from the present case in that it involved an at will employee, rather than \u2014 as here \u2014 an employee covered by a collective bargaining agreement containing a \u201cjust cause\u201d provision. Noting, however, that the New Jersey courts have yet to decide whether an employee in appellant\u2019s situation has a common law cause of action for wrongful discharge, the district court turned to <em>Pierce </em>to predict how the New Jersey Supreme Court would rule:</p>\n<blockquote id=\"ak-dedup-0\">The decision in <em>Pierce </em>involved an at-will employee, and the entire discussion leading up to the holding dealt with the need to provide some protections for at-will employees: that is, employees who could be terminated with or without cause at any time, due to the absence of contractual provisions restricting termination to \u201cjust cause\u201d or otherwise providing a definite term of employment. The decision is predicated, it seems on the <em>absence of any other remedies </em>for this class of employees and the realization that, in limited circumstances there must be limits to an employer\u2019s authority over its employees.</blockquote>\n<p id=\"b201-4\">611 F.Supp. at 179 (emphasis in original).</p>\n<p id=\"b201-5\">Though we cannot dispute the district court\u2019s characterization of the discussion in <em>Pierce, </em>we have no occasion to consider whether the district court was correct in holding that <em>Pierce </em>would not be extended <em>generally </em>to contractual employees. In our view, the cause of action asserted by appellant for discharge in retaliation for making a worker\u2019s compensation claim is, if not wholly distinct from the <em>Pierce </em>cause of action, then at the very least a special subcategory that is available to both at will and contractual employees.</p>\n<p id=\"b201-6\">We find it significant that at the time of the <em>Pierce </em>decision the New Jersey Supreme Court stated that it was already \u201cwell established that an employee has a cause of action where he is discharged in retaliation for filing a worker\u2019s compensation claim, even if the worker\u2019s compensation statute does not provide such a remedy.\u201d 84 N.J. at 68, 417 A.2d at 510 (citing <em>Lally v. Copygraphics, </em>173 N.J.Super. 162, 413 A.2d 960 (App.Div.1980)). This statement does not suggest any limitation to at will employees, nor does the subsequent per curiam affirmance of the Appellate Division\u2019s decision in <em>Lally. Lally v. Copygraphics, </em>85 N.J. 668, 428 A.2d 1317 (1981). Nor can it be said that <em>Lally, </em>like <em>Pierce, </em>was predicated on a lack of other remedies. Indeed, it specifically notes the availability of other statutory remedies:</p>\n<blockquote id=\"b201-8\">[T]he penal and administrative remedies that are provided ... to rectify this form of illegal employment practice will clearly be augmented by recognition of an alternative or supplemental judicial right to secure civil redress. A common law action for wrongful discharge in this context will effectuate statutory objectives and complement the legislative and administrative policies which undergird the workers\u2019 compensation laws.</blockquote>\n<p id=\"b201-9\">428 A.2d at 1318. It seems to us that <em>Lally, </em>insofar as it created an additional remedy, is premised on the overriding importance of protecting the right of employees \u2014 at will or otherwise \u2014 to seek worker\u2019s compensation.</p>\n<p id=\"b201-10\">More important, we think there is a logical distinction between the <em>Pierce </em>and <em>Lally </em>causes of action. <em>Pierce </em>recognized a right of action for discharges in violation of \u201cclear mandates of public policy\u201d that do not necessarily relate directly to employer-employee relations, as, for example', a professional code of ethics. In <em>Lally </em>and the instant case, in contrast, the plaintiffs sought damages for a discharge specifically declared to be unlawful by a statute applicable by its terms to <em>all </em>employees. \u201cThe statutory declaration of the illegality of such a discharge underscores its wrongful and tortious character for which redress should be available. Such a cause of action is strongly founded in public policy which, in this case, is reflected in the statutory prohibitions themselves.\u201d 428 A.2d at 1318. We think it is unlikely where the legislature has declared an employment practice unlawful as to all employees, and the courts have recognized an action at law <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"124\">*124</page-number>to enforce that declaration, that contractual employees as a class would, or could, be relegated to any remedies provided under their collective bargaining agreements for the selfsame illegal practices.<footnotemark>2</footnotemark></p>\n<p id=\"b202-4\">We therefore predict that with respect to discharges in retaliation for filing worker\u2019s compensation claims, the Supreme Court of New Jersey would extend the individual right of action for damages to contractual employees covered by \u201cjust cause\u201d clauses. We make no prediction as to whether contractual employees would generally be afforded a common law cause of action for discharge in violation of public policy.</p>\n<p id=\"b202-5\">CONCLUSION</p>\n<p id=\"b202-6\">For the foregoing reasons, we will reverse the judgment of the district court and remand for further proceedings consistent with this opinion.</p>\n<footnote label=\"1\">\n<p id=\"b199-13\">. This statute provides in relevant part:</p>\n<blockquote id=\"b199-14\">It shall be unlawful for any employer or his duly authorized agent to discharge or in any other manner discriminate against an employee as to his employment because such employee has claimed or attempted to claim workmen\u2019s compensation benefits from such employer, or because he has testified, or is about to testify, in any proceeding under the chapter to which this act is a supplement.</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b199-22\">Appellant\u2019s complaint also contained counts alleging violations of N.J.Stat.Ann. \u00a7 34:14-44 (1959), a provision limited by its terms to public employees, as well as federal constitutional claims. Appellant later conceded that as a nonpublic employee the New Jersey statute did not apply to him, and that there was no state action involved. Accordingly, these additional counts were dismissed.</blockquote>\n</footnote>\n<footnote label=\"2\">\n<p id=\"b202-15\">. Because worker\u2019s compensation rights are rooted in state law, rather than the collective bargaining agreement, and because the cause of action in question is part-and-parcel of the state\u2019s worker\u2019s compensation scheme, we do not believe it is pre-empted by federal labor law. <em>See also Peabody Gallon v. Dollar, </em>666 F.2d 1309, 1316 (10th Cir.1981) (cause of action has nothing to do with union organization or collective bargaining, nor is there tendency to conflict with federal labor law). For the same reasons, we do not agree with the district court that an employer has a right to rely on the contract grievance procedure \"exclusive of any other\u201d in this case, 611 F.2d at 180.</p>\n</footnote>\n</opinion>\n</casebody>\n",
