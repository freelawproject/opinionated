MOORE, Circuit Judge.</author>\n<p id=\"b713-13\">This is an appeal from the granting of a motion to dismiss in an action for breach of the duty of fair representation instituted by a former federal employee against her union. The trial court held it had no subject matter jurisdiction over the action because in the adoption of the Civil Service Reform Act of 1978, Congress had restricted to the Federal Labor Relations Authority exclusive jurisdiction over disputes between federal employees and their unions. We conclude such was not the intent of Congress and reverse.</p>\n<p id=\"b713-14\">I.</p>\n<p id=\"b713-15\">After seven years of employment by the United States Department of the Air Force, appellant Sharon K. Pham was notified she was to be removed from her position as \u00e1 supply clerk at Tinker Air Force Base. She contacted a representative of her union, defendant American Federation of Government Employees, Local 916, AFL-CIO (Union or defendant). Because the Union had entered into a collective bargaining agreement with the Air Force, Ms. Pham sought advice on the procedure to invoke a grievance over her removal.</p>\n<p id=\"b713-16\">Ms. Pham was advised she could either proceed through the scheme established in the collective bargaining agreement, or she could initiate a grievance with the Merit System Protection Board (MSPB). Ms. Pham elected to follow the statutory procedure before the MSPB and prepared the necessary forms for the Union to submit. For some reason unexplained in the record, though the papers were completed, they were not promptly filed by the Union. When the error was discovered, the papers were mailed, but the mailing was ninety days late and untimely under 5 C.F.R. \u00a7 1201.115(b) (1986). Consequently, the grievance was dismissed, and an appeal by the Union was denied by the MSPB. Although Ms. Pham was informed of these circumstances, the record is unclear about when she learned the Union had failed to timely file her grievance.</p>\n<p id=\"b713-17\">Ms. Pham subsequently initiated a complaint in state court against the Union averring the Union had breached its contract with her and its duty of fair representation owed to her under the collective bargaining agreement. The action was removed to the United States District Court by the Union, which then moved to dismiss on jurisdictional grounds.</p>\n<p id=\"b713-18\">In its motion to dismiss, the Union argued that the complaint brought by Ms. Pham was within the exclusive remedy of the Civil Service Reform Act of 1978 (CSRA). Describing the duty of fair representation as an express component of a complex federal regulatory scheme, the <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"636\">*636</page-number>Union argued Ms. Pham\u2019s private suit was preempted by the Labor-Management and Employee Relations Act, 5 U.S.C. \u00a7 7101 <em>et seq. </em>(the Act), which codifies part of the CSRA and establishes the Federal Labor Relations Authority (the Authority). Alternatively, the Union argued Ms. Pham\u2019s suit was barred by a six-month statute of limitations described in <em>DelCostello v. International Brotherhood of Teamsters, </em>462 U.S. 151, 103 S.Ct. 2281, 76 L.Ed.2d 476 (1983).</p>\n<p id=\"b714-4\">In granting the motion to dismiss, the district court did not rule upon the statute of limitations issue. Instead, it interpreted the Act to provide a presumption of federal labor preemption, thus mandating the conclusion that Congress intended the Authority to exercise exclusive jurisdiction over Ms. Pham\u2019s grievance.</p>\n<p id=\"b714-5\">Key to the court\u2019s analysis was the absence of an equivalent to \u00a7 301 of the Labor Management Relations Act (LMRA) in the Act.<footnotemark>1</footnotemark> Moreover, the court believed deference to the Authority\u2019s power to regulate labor-management relations in the federal sector required entrusting these matters to its expertise.</p>\n<p id=\"b714-6\">II.</p>\n<p id=\"b714-7\">While this case presents an issue of first impression in this circuit, we are constrained to indicate we break no new ground in holding there is subject matter jurisdiction in suits of this nature. Our conclusion is hinged not only on an examination of the Act but also on that precedent which must nourish our understanding of a union\u2019s duty of fair representation. Finally, we cannot perceive of a just reason, in the absence of clear legislative direction, to barricade the only remaining avenue of relief for the appellant. Although we are reluctant to interfere with the otherwise complex labor-management scheme at issue, we cannot find a justification for preemption under the circumstances present in this case.</p>\n<p id=\"b714-13\">The statutory scheme at issue is the CSRA, Pub.L. No. 95-454, 92 Stat. 1111 (1978),<footnotemark>2</footnotemark> which \u201cconstitute[s] the most comprehensive reform of the Federal work force since passage of the Pendleton Act in 1883.\u201d S.Rep. No. 969, 95th Cong., 2d Sess. 1 (1978), <em>reprinted in </em>1978 U.S. Code Cong. &amp; Ad. News 2723. The CSRA aspired to \u201cpromote a more efficient civil service while preserving the merit principle in Federal employment.\u201d <em>Id. </em>These merit principles represent a continuing concern for a politically neutral, merit-based administration of the Civil Service system.<footnotemark>3</footnotemark> Conjoined with the enunciation of merit principles is the CSRA\u2019s enumeration of prohibited personnel practices, a \u201cBill of Rights\u201d for federal employees.<footnotemark>4</footnotemark> The CSRA was not intended to supplant or alter constitutional rights but to define a procedure under which those rights could be asserted. <em>Carter v. Kurzejeski, </em>706 F.2d 835, 841 (8th Cir.1983).</p>\n<p id=\"b714-14\">Title VII of the CSRA, the Act, governs labor-management relations in the federal service. In the statement of purpose of the Act, Congress announced that \u201cexperience in both private and public employment\u201d indicates that the statutory protection of the right of employees to organize, bargain collectively, and participate through labor organizations of their own choosing (a) safeguards the public interest; (b) enhances the conduct of public business; and (c) facilitates and encourages amicable settlements of disputes between employees and employers. 5 U.S.C. \u00a7 7101(a). To effectuate these goals, Title VII establishes grievance and arbitration procedures for federal employees organized in collective bargaining units.</p>\n<p id=\"b715-4\"><page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"637\">*637</page-number>This comprehensive scheme to manage the relations between the employer, the federal government, and its employees, collectively organized into bargaining units, did not arise in a vacuum. The Legislative History of the Act states, \u201cIt is intended that unfair labor practice complaints will be handled by the General Counsel of the Authority in a manner essentially identical to the National Labor Relations Board practices in the private sector.\u201d S.Rep. No. 95-969, 95th Cong., 2d Sess. 106, <em>reprinted in </em>(1978), U.S. Code Cong. &amp; Ad. News 2828.<footnotemark>5</footnotemark></p>\n<p id=\"b715-5\">Under the Act, an aggrieved employee may choose a negotiated grievance procedure or a statutory procedure in which an adverse personnel action is appealed directly to the MSPB. 5 U.S.C. \u00a7 7121(d). Although each procedure is exclusive, an employee may petition the MSPB for review of the personnel action undertaken in the negotiated grievance procedure. 5 U.S.C. \u00a7 7121(d). Judicial review of final orders of the Authority is available in the United States courts of appeal. 5 U.S.C. \u00a7 7123(a).<footnotemark>6</footnotemark></p>\n<p id=\"b715-6\">Employee-management relations in the public sector, thus, draw their analog from the private sector as governed by the LMRA, 29 U.S.C. \u00a7\u00a7 151-169, and the Railway Labor Act, 45 U.S.C. \u00a7\u00a7 151-181. Both schemes are premised on the exclusive recognition of a labor organization that has been properly selected by federal employees. 5 U.S.C. \u00a7 7111(a). Because the union becomes the sole representative of federal employees in contract negotiation and enforcement of the collective bargaining agreement, the Act requires the union to represent all members of the bargaining unit fairly. This requirement, referred to as a statutory duty of fair representation, embodies a continuing judicial concern with protecting individual interests statutorily subordinated to the union\u2019s representation of the bargaining unit.</p>\n<p id=\"b715-11\">The Supreme Court first recognized the duty of fair representation in <em>Steele v. Louisville &amp; Nashville &amp; N.R. Co., </em>323 U.S. 192, 202-03, 65 S.Ct. 226, 232, 89 L.Ed. 173 (1944), a case arising under the Railway Labor Act, and later extended the doctrine to unions certified pursuant to the National Labor Relations Act in <em>Ford Motor Co. v. Huffman, </em>345 U.S. 330, 337-38, 73 S.Ct. 681, 685-86, 97 L.Ed. 1048 (1953). Later, in <em>Vaca v. Sipes, </em>386 U.S. 171, 182, 87 S.Ct. 903, 912-13, 17 L.Ed.2d 842 (1967), the Court recognized \u201cthe duty of fair representation has stood as a bulwark to prevent arbitrary union conduct against individuals stripped of traditional forms of redress by the provisions of federal labor law.\u201d Accordingly, the Court concluded, \u201c[a] breach of the statutory duty of fair representation occurs only when a union\u2019s conduct toward a member of the collective bargaining unit is arbitrary, discriminatory, or in bad faith.\u201d <em>Id. </em>at 190, 87 S.Ct. at 916.<footnotemark>7</footnotemark></p>\n<p id=\"b715-12\">While recognizing that the LMRA reflected important governmental interests by entrusting labor-management relations in an exclusive agency, the <em>Vaca </em>court found preemption of a claim for breach of the duty of fair representation was not warranted. The Court reasoned that the primary justification for preemption \u2014 the need to avoid conflicting rules of substan<page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"638\">*638</page-number>tive law in the labor relations area and the desirability of leaving the development of such rules to the agency \u2014 were not present in this instance given the \u201cnature of the particular interests being asserted and the effect upon the administration of national labor policies.\u201d <em>Id. </em>at 180-81, 87 S.Ct. at 912. Unwilling to characterize a breach of the duty of fair representation as an unfair labor practice, the <em>Vaca </em>court decided that the National Labor Relations Board did not have exclusive jurisdiction to resolve the claim. \u201c[T]he unique role played by the duty of fair representation doctrine in the scheme of federal labor laws, and its important relationship to the judicial enforcement of collective bargaining agreements in the context presented here, render the <em>Garmon </em>preemption<footnotemark>8</footnotemark> doctrine inapplicable.\u201d <em>Id. </em>at 188, 87 S.Ct. at 916.</p>\n<p id=\"b716-4\">The Act, however, postdates <em>Vaca. </em>The district court in the instant action dismissed the implications of <em>Vaca </em>not only because the decision predated the Act but also because <em>Vaca </em>involved labor-management in the private sector. Given the analysis of the right involved and the scrutiny of the policy issues by the Supreme Court, we believe <em>Vaca </em>continues to provide an analytical model for our present inquiry.</p>\n<p id=\"b716-5\">Key to the district court\u2019s resolution is the absence of a \u00a7 301 parallel in the Act and the policy assumption that public interests are vastly different from those in the private sector. We cannot agree with either proposition. Nevertheless, interpretation of the absence of a \u00a7 301 from the Act has become the basis for disagreement when the question of jurisdiction is raised. Hence, however meager the decisions in this area, there appears to be a split among the circuits on whether a federal district court can exercise jurisdiction over the breach of a duty of fair representation claim.</p>\n<p id=\"b716-6\">In <em>Warren v. Local 1759, Am. Federation of Gov. Emp., </em>764 F.2d 1395 (11th Cir.), <em>cert. denied, </em>\u2014 U.S. -, 106 S.Ct. 527, 88 L.Ed.2d 459 (1985), the Eleventh Circuit concluded that the absence of a provision in the Act similar to \u00a7 301 indicated the clear intention of Congress to confer exclusive jurisdiction in the Authority over a federal employee\u2019s duty of fair representation claim. In contrast, the Fourth Circuit, without a written opinion, affirmed the district court\u2019s holding in <em>Naylor v. American Fed. of Govt. Emp. Loc. 446, </em>580 F.Supp. 137 (W.D.N.C.1983), <em>aff'd, </em>727 F.2d 1103, <em>cert. denied, </em>469 U.S. 850, 105 S.Ct. 169, 83 L.Ed.2d 105 (1984), that the Act tracks the LMRA to permit <em>Vaca </em>jurisdiction over a duty of fair representation suit. Similarly, in <em>Karahalios v. Defense Language Institute, </em>534 F.Supp. 1202 (N.D.Cal.), <em>reconsideration denied, </em>544 F.Supp. 77 (N.D.Cal.1982), the district court held it could exercise subject matter jurisdiction over the plaintiff\u2019s duty of fair representation suit.</p>\n<p id=\"b716-10\">The Supreme Court has recently cast a new light on this impasse and indicated a resolution of the problem. In <em>DelCostello, </em>462 U.S. at 164, 103 S.Ct. at 2290, deciding which statute of limitations applied in an employee\u2019s action against an employer and a union, the court clarified that:</p>\n<blockquote id=\"b716-11\">Such a suit, as a formal matter comprises two causes of action. The suit against the employer rests on \u00a7 301, since the employee is alleging a breach of the collective bargaining agreement. The suit against the union is one for breach of the union\u2019s duty of fair representation, which is <em>implied </em>under the scheme of the National Labor Relations Act.</blockquote>\n<p id=\"b716-12\">(Emphasis added.) Thus, two principles are now clarified. First, for the purpose of subject matter jurisdiction in fair representation suits, we look not to the specific language of the LMRA but to its implication. Second, the duty of fair representation, which is a judicial creation, finds its source in federal law predating <em>Vaca.</em></p>\n<p id=\"b716-13\">Given this concept of duality in an employee\u2019s \u201chybrid\u201d suit, it becomes simple to recognize why Congress did not enact a \u00a7 301 parallel in the Act. Since the first facet of the employee\u2019s action is against <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"639\">*639</page-number>the employer, the parallel would create a waiver of sovereign immunity in the field of federal labor-management relations. While reasons exist for Congress not to insulate a private employer from a damage suit by an aggrieved employee, those same reasons do not apply to the United States. Yet, recalling the distinct analogies between the LMRA and the Act and the principle that fair representation is a judicially created, implied duty, it does not follow that Congress intended to proscribe private actions by federal employees against their unions simply because it did not create a \u00a7 301 twin in the Act. The important public interest inherent in the duty of fair representation is too great to draw such a conclusion, and a contrary view negates the statutory history tying the remedial provisions of the Act to the LMRA.</p>\n<p id=\"b717-4\">The duty of the union which is the focus of this suit is not the same as the union\u2019s statutory mandate not to discriminate on the basis of union membership found in 5 U.S.C. \u00a7 7114(a)(1). That section does not encompass the same duty that has been described as the duty of fair representation. The duty of fair representation is much broader than a simple prohibition against treating union members differently from other employees in the same bargaining unit.</p>\n<p id=\"b717-5\">In short, we find a union representing federal employees is under the same constraints of fair representation as one representing private employees, and to the extent private employees have access to federal courts to redress grievances against their unions for breach of fair representation, so, too, have federal employees. <em>Vaca, </em>386 U.S. 171, 87 S.Ct. 903; <em>Karahalios v. Defense Language Institute, </em>534 F.Supp. 1202 (N.D.Cal.); <em>reconsideration denied, </em>544 F.Supp. 77 (N.D. Cal.1982).<footnotemark>9</footnotemark></p>\n<p id=\"b717-7\">Although the district court can exercise jurisdiction, we do not imply the Union\u2019s conduct was a breach of the duty of fair representation. This determination must await a presentation on the merits.</p>\n<p id=\"b717-8\">REVERSED.</p>\n<footnote label=\"1\">\n<p id=\"b714-8\">.
