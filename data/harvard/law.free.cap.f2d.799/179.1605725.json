Because petitioners failed to exhaust their administrative remedies by perfecting an appeal to the Board of Immigration Appeals, we are without jurisdiction to review the denial of asylum.</p>\n<p id=\"b258-23\">I</p>\n<p id=\"b258-24\">Petitioners, Benjamin Clarence Townsend and Julia Mydea Randall Townsend, are natives and citizens of Liberia who entered the United States in 1979 as nonim-migrant visitors. In April 1980, the Liberian government was toppled by a coup, and Townsend\u2019s father, national chairman of the ruling True Whig party, was executed along with twelve other top officials of the deposed Liberian government \u201con a sun-baked Atlantic beach ... before a crowd of hundreds of cheering soldiers and thousands of civilians.\u201d</p>\n<p id=\"b258-25\">In October 1980, Townsend and his fiancee (now wife) submitted applications for asylum to the Immigration and Naturalization Service, which were denied by the INS District Director in December 1983. In May 1984, they were charged with deportability under section 241(a)(9) of the Immigration and Nationality Act, 8 U.S.C. \u00a7 1251(a)(9). At a hearing before an immigration judge, the Townsends conceded deportability, and renewed their applications for asylum. <em>See </em>8 U.S.C. \u00a7 1158.</p>\n<p id=\"b258-26\">At the hearing, the Townsends\u2019 original 1980 applications for asylum were admitted into the record. On the forms, in answer to questions which asked whether Townsend had \u201cbelong[ed] to any organization(s) which were considered hostile to the interests of your Home Country,\u201d and whether <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"181\">*181</page-number>he \u201cever expressed political opinions or acted in a manner which was regarded by the authorities as opposed to the interests of your Home Government,\u201d Townsend checked the \u201cno\u201d boxes.</p>\n<p id=\"b259-5\">At the hearing itself, Townsend testified that he was an American-Liberian, a descendant of the American blacks who became expatriates in Africa following the abolition of slavery in the United States, and who ruled Liberia through the True Whig party until the 1980 revolution. Townsend testified that the True Whig party is now viewed as an oppressor of the masses, and that anyone considered sympathetic to the party poses a threat to the current regime. He also testified that before leaving Liberia he was chairman of the youth movement of the party, and that because political ideologies are assumed to be family-held, in Liberia he would be expected to follow in his father\u2019s political footsteps.</p>\n<p id=\"b259-6\">In his decision, the immigration judge stated that \u201cat first blush ... it would appear that what happened to [Townsend\u2019s] father and other political leaders of the ruling True Whig Pary [sic] may well show his fear that sooner or later he also will become a victim of persecution is well-founded.\u201d However, the immigration judge found Townsend\u2019s testimony concerning his political activities and the threat he posed to the present government not credible because it conflicted with answers in his original asylum application that stated he had not belonged to any organizations hostile to the interests of the current Doe regime.<footnotemark>1</footnotemark> Relying on an advisory opinion of the State Department that expressed the view that \u201cnearly all Liberians could return without fear of persecution,\u201d the immigration judge found that Townsend had failed to establish a \u201cwell-founded fear\u201d of persecution.</p>\n<p id=\"b259-7\">Townsend and his wife appealed the denial of their applications to the Board of Immigration Appeals. On the requisite form under \u201creasons for this appeal,\u201d Townsend stated only that \u201cmale respondent has sufficiently established his \u2018well founded fear of persecution\u2019 according to present case law.\u201d Although he indicated the desire to file an accompanying brief, none was ever filed, even though an extension of time to do so was granted by the Board. Consequently, the Board summarily dismissed the appeal under 8 C.F.R. \u00a7 3.1(d)(l-a), because \u201cthe reasons for the appeal have not been meaningfully identified on the Notice of Appeal.\u201d Townsend and his wife now appeal the denial of their applications for asylum to this court pursuant to 8 U.S.C. \u00a7 1105a.</p>\n<p id=\"b259-11\">II</p>\n<p id=\"b259-12\">The statute providing for judicial review in this case provides that \u201c[a]n order of deportation ... shall not be reviewed by any court if the alien has not exhausted the administrative remedies available to him as of right under the immigration laws and regulations.\u201d 8 U.S.C. \u00a7 1105a(c). When exhaustion is statutorily mandated, the requirement is jurisdictional. <em>Eluska v. Andrus, </em>587 F.2d 996, 999 (9th Cir.1978).</p>\n<p id=\"b259-13\">The regulations governing appeals to the Board from an order of an immigration judge provide for summary dismissal of any case where \u201cthe party concerned fails to specify the reasons for his appeal on Form I-290A (Notice of Appeal).\u201d 8 C.F.R. \u00a7 3.1(d)(l-a). In order to comply with this regulation, the Board has held that \u201cgeneralized statements of the reasons for these appeals ... are totally inadequate [because t]hey do not tell us what aspect of the special inquiry officer\u2019s order they consider incorrect and for what reason.\u201d <em>Matter of Holguin, </em>13 I &amp; N Dec. 423, 425 (BIA 1969). Recently, and more specifically, the Board has held that:</p>\n<blockquote id=\"b260-3\"><page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"182\">*182</page-number>It is ... insufficient to merely assert that the immigration judge improperly found that deportability had been established or denied an application for relief from deportation____ Where eligibility for discretionary relief is at issue, it should be stated whether the error relates to grounds of statutory eligibility or to the exercise of discretion. Furthermore, it should be clear whether the alleged impropriety in the decision lies with the immigration judge\u2019s interpretation of the facts or his application of legal standards. Where a question of law is presented, supporting authority should be included, and where the dispute is on the facts, there should be a discussion of the particular details contested.</blockquote>\n<p id=\"b260-6\"><em>Matter of Valencia, </em>Interim Decision No. 3006 (BIA 1986) (citation omitted). Townsend\u2019s statement of reasons for his appeal to the Board consisted of a conclusory statement that he had \u201csufficiently established his \u2018well founded fear of persecution\u2019 according to present case law.\u201d Clearly this was inadequate under the Board\u2019s established construction of its regulation. Moreover, while Townsend was given an opportunity to file a brief explaining in further detail the reasons for his appeal, he failed to do so. The Board did not abuse its discretion in dismissing his appeal.</p>\n<p id=\"b260-7\">Though it appears that petitioner\u2019s application for asylum may have had substantial merit, we are constrained to view their neglect in not perfecting their appeal to the Board as a failure to exhaust available administrative remedies.<footnotemark>2</footnotemark> To hold otherwise, and reach the merits in a case that has been summarily dismissed by the Board, would effectively eliminate one tier of \u00e1dministrative review. We conclude that we are without jurisdiction to review petitioners\u2019 arguments regarding the immigration judge\u2019s denial of their asylum applications. <em>See Hernandez v. INS, </em>539 F.2d 384 (5th Cir.1976). Accordingly, this appeal is DISMISSED.</p>\n<footnote label=\"1\">\n<p id=\"b259-8\">. We do not reach the issue, but observe that the immigration judge\u2019s conclusion on this point is dubious, at best. Townsend\u2019s testimony was consistent with the answers in his application, since the questions asked whether Townsend had committed any acts hostile to the government of his \"Home Country,\u201d and which Townsend understandably would have read in 1980 as referring to the True Whig government.</p>\n</footnote>\n<footnote label=\"2\">\n<p id=\"b260-8\">. The apparent harshness of applying the exhaustion requirement in this case is somewhat mitigated by the fact that on August 15, 1986, Townsend may have become eligible to apply for suspension of deportation under 8 U.S.C. \u00a7 1254, provided his seven-year presence in this country has been continuous.</p>\n</footnote>\n</opinion>\n</casebody>\n",
