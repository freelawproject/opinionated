Most of his contentions are of a sort with that complaining that his motion was assigned a civil docket number, rather than filed in the original criminal action, and do not merit discussion. Among them are complaints of failure to appoint counsel to represent him in connection with the motion, failure to permit discovery and hold an evidentiary hearing, failure to grant a general \u201cMotion to Inspect,\u201d and the refusal of a magistrate to stand recused.</p>\n<p id=\"b261-10\">Shaid\u2019s chief complaint is of a failure of Judge Justice to stand recused <em>sua sponte, </em>in view of his friendship with named persons connected with two banks that Shaid had defrauded. Judge Steger found, however, in passing on Shaid\u2019s present motion, that Judge Justice knew nothing of his friends\u2019 connection with these banks until Shaid\u2019s present motion was filed, a finding which is not erroneous \u2014 clearly or otherwise. As for Shaid\u2019s claim that his 35-year sentence was so harsh as to constitute ostensible evidence of the trial judge\u2019s want of impartiality. Judge Steger determined that Judge Justice merely followed the probation officer\u2019s recommendation in this respect \u2014 one which, in view of Shaid\u2019s lurid exploits, prior criminal record, and 101-year sentencing exposure, was not disproportionately severe.</p>\n<p id=\"b261-11\">AFFIRMED.</p>\n</opinion>\n</casebody>\n",
