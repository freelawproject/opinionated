The action was brought to remedy conditions of confinement at the Rocky Butte Jail (RBJ) and to challenge proposed conditions at the Downtown Detention Center (DDC), which was planned to replace RBJ. Plaintiffs had also challenged population limits and length of stay limits at the Multnomah County Booking Facility (MCBF). <em>See Jordan v. Multnomah County, </em>694 F.2d 1156 (9th Cir.1982) (per curiam).</p>\n<p id=\"b1339-18\">Plaintiffs now appeal the district court\u2019s award of attorneys\u2019 fees for legal services rendered on behalf of the plaintiff class between September 28, 1982, and October 26, 1983. These services were for the purposes of preventing the early opening of 1-205, a freeway constructed adjacent to RBJ, and of obtaining an order holding defendants in contempt for violation of the injunction limiting population and length of stays at MCBF.<footnotemark>1</footnotemark></p>\n<p id=\"b1339-19\">Plaintiffs contend that the district court abused its discretion in awarding them attorneys\u2019 fees in the amount of $43,500, substantially less than the $160,130 that they requested.<footnotemark>2</footnotemark> We affirm in part, and reverse in part and remand.</p>\n<p id=\"b1339-20\">FACTS:</p>\n<p id=\"b1339-21\"><em>The 1-205 Issue. </em>Plaintiffs submitted a fee application that requested compensation for 110.9 hours for the time of their lead attorney, Mr. LaBarre, at the rate of $140 per hour. They sought compensation for 72.7 hours of associate time at $80 per hour. The total request was for $19,382 before application of a multiplier. The district court awarded $7,500, finding that much of the work undertaken by plaintiffs\u2019 <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"1264\">*1264</page-number>counsel was not \u201clegal in nature.\u201d<footnotemark>3</footnotemark> The court found that the range of time necessary for the type of work performed by counsel on the 1-205 issue was 50 to 150 hours and that the fees for work of this nature ranged from $65 to $100 per hour. The court\u2019s finding was based in part upon rates paid to plaintiffs\u2019 counsel in the past for similar services. The court denied the request for a multiplier.</p>\n<p id=\"b1340-4\"><em>Contempt Proceeding. </em>Multnomah County violated the court\u2019s order with regard to the length of stay and population limits at MCBF. Plaintiffs\u2019 counsel instituted contempt proceedings and eventually prevailed. Plaintiffs requested compensation for 403.4 hours at hourly rates of $80 per hour for associate time and $140 per hour for Mr. LaBarre\u2019s time. The total fee request on the contempt issue was $45,544 before application of the requested multiplier. The district court awarded $30,000 in attorneys\u2019 fees, finding</p>\n<blockquote id=\"AdF\">that the number of hours for which plaintiffs seek recovery is high. However, far fewer hours would have been spent had the County been more cooperative in the investigative phase of the case. I find that the range of hours reasonable to be spent in such a matter is from 300 to 400 hours. I find that $100 to $125 an hour is a reasonable hourly rate for compensation in such matters.</blockquote>\n<p id=\"b1340-5\">The court denied plaintiffs\u2019 request for a multiplier.</p>\n<p id=\"b1340-6\"><em>Attorneys\u2019 Fees Applications. </em>Plaintiffs sought compensation for time expended by counsel in pursuit of their attorneys\u2019 fees applications on the 1-205 and contempt matters. Plaintiffs\u2019 counsel initially submitted an application for 36.3 hours of time on attorneys\u2019 fees matters. However, the district court requested additional documentation on the 1-205 issue because that matter had been handled outside the purview of the court. Plaintiffs\u2019 counsel spent a substantial amount of time preparing the requested documentation. After voluntarily reducing the fee request by over 37 hours, plaintiffs requested compensation for a total of 153.6 hours for fee application matters. The requested fee totaled $19,059 at $80 per hour for associate time and $140 per hour for Mr. LaBarre\u2019s time. The district court found that 50 to 75 hours was a reasonable amount of time to expend on this matter and awarded a fee of $6,000. The court did not grant plaintiffs\u2019 request for a multiplier.</p>\n<p id=\"b1340-10\">DISCUSSION:</p>\n<p id=\"b1340-11\">In a federal civil rights action or proceeding, \u201cthe court, in its discretion, may allow the prevailing party, other than the United States, a reasonable attorney\u2019s fee as part of the costs.\u201d 42 U.S.C. \u00a7 1988. We review the district court\u2019s determination of the amount of attorneys\u2019 fees awarded pursuant to \u00a7 1988 for an abuse of discretion. <em>See Ackerley Communications, Inc. v. City of Salem, </em>752 F.2d 1394, 1396 (9th Cir.), <em>cert. denied, </em>\u2014 U.S. -, 105 S.Ct. 3503, 87 L.Ed.2d 634 (1985); <em>Sethy v.

The district court\u2019s discretion to award attorney\u2019s fees under \u00a7 1988 has, however, been narrowly construed, <em>Ackerley Communications, </em>752 F.2d at 1396, and is circumscribed by decisions of the Supreme Court and this circuit. <em>See, e.g., Pennsylvania v. Delaware Valley Citizens\u2019 Council for Clean Air, </em>\u2014 U.S. -, 106 S.Ct. 3308, 92 L.Ed.2d 737 (1986); <em>Blum v.

The district court should clearly and concisely explain the grounds for its decision. <em>See Hensley, </em>461 U.S. at 437, 103 S.Ct. at 1941; <em>Probe v. State Teachers\u2019 Retirement System, </em>780 F.2d 776, 785 (9th Cir.), <em>cert. denied, </em>\u2014 U.S. -, 106 S.Ct. 2891, 90 L.Ed.2d 978 (1986).</p>\n<p id=\"b1341-8\">I. <em>Reasonableness of Attorney\u2019s Fee.</em></p>\n<p id=\"b1341-9\">Congress provided for an award \u00f3f reasonable attorneys\u2019 fees to successful civil rights plaintiffs \u201cto ensure \u2018effective access to the judicial process\u2019 for persons with civil rights grievances.\u201d <em>Hensley, </em>461 U.S. at 429, 103 S.Ct. at 1937 (quoting H.R.Rep. No. 94-1558, p. 1 (1976)). While \u00a7 1988 does not explain what constitutes a reasonable fee, the legislative history expressly endorses the guidelines developed by the Fifth Circuit in <em>Johnson v. Georgia Highway Express, Inc., </em>488 F.2d 714 (5th Cir.1974).<footnotemark>4</footnotemark> <em>See </em>S.Rep. No. 94-1011, p. 6 (1976); H.R.Rep. No. 94-1558, p. 8 (1976) U.S.Code Cong. &amp; Admin.News 1976, pp. 5908, 5913; <em>City of Riverside v. Rivera, </em>\u2014 U.S. -, ---, 106 S.Ct. 2686, 2691-92, 91 L.Ed.2d 466 (1986).</p>\n<p id=\"b1341-14\">The Supreme Court has adopted a \u201chybrid approach\u201d to the question of the proper manner by which to determine a reasonable attorneys\u2019 fee. <em>See Pennsylvania, </em>\u2014 U.S. at---, 106 S.Ct. at 3097-99; <em>Hensley, </em>461 U.S. 424, 103 S.Ct. 1933. This approach combines elements of the <em>Johnson </em>12-factor analysis and the lodestar method of calculation developed by the Third Circuit in <em>Lindy Bros. Builders, Inc. v. American Radiator &amp; Standard Sanitary Corp., </em>487 F.2d 161 (3d Cir.1973).<footnotemark>5</footnotemark> The lodestar determination has emerged as the predominate element of the analysis. <em>See Pennsylvania, </em>\u2014 U.S. at---, 106 S.Ct. at 3095-99.</p>\n<p id=\"b1341-19\">\u201c \u2018The most useful starting point for determining the amount of a reasonable fee is the number of hours reasonably expended on the litigation multiplied by a reasonable hourly rate.\u2019 \u201d <em>Pennsylvania, </em>\u2014 U.S. at -, 106 S.Ct. at 3097 (quoting <em>Hensley, </em>461 U.S. at 433, 103 S.Ct. at 1939). This product may then be adjusted on the basis of \u201cother considerations.\u201d <em>Id. </em>(quoting <em>Hensley, </em>461 U.S. at 434,103 S.Ct. at 1940). <em>Hensley </em>viewed the \u201cother considerations\u201d to include the <em>Johnson </em>factors, but noted that \u201cmany of these factors usually are <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"1266\">*1266</page-number>subsumed\u201d within the lodestar calculation.<footnotemark>6</footnotemark> A \u201cstrong presumption\u201d exists that the lodestar figure represents a \u201creasonable\u201d fee, <em>Pennsylvania, </em>\u2014 U.S; at -, 106 S.Ct. at 3098, and upward adjustments of the lodestar are proper only in \u201crare\u201d and \u201cexceptional\u201d cases, supported by specific evidence on the record and detailed findings by the district court. <em>Blum, </em>465 U.S. at 898-901, 104 S.Ct. at 1548-50.</p>\n<p id=\"b1342-6\">Consequently, a critical inquiry in determining a reasonable attorneys\u2019 fee for purposes of \u00a7 1988 is the reasonable hourly rate. <em>Blum, </em>465 U.S. at 895 n. 11, 104 S.Ct. at 1547 n. 11. The prevailing market rate in the community at the time services were rendered is indicative of a reasonable hourly rate.<footnotemark>7</footnotemark> <em>Id. </em>at 895, 104 S.Ct. at 1547. The fee applicant has the burden of producing satisfactory evidence, in addition to the affidavits of its counsel, that the requested rates are in line with those prevailing in the community for similar services of lawyers of reasonably comparable skill and reputation. <em>See id. </em>at 895-97 and n. 11, 104 S.Ct. at 1547-48 and n. 11. If the applicant satisfies its burden of showing that the claimed rate and number of hours<footnotemark>8</footnotemark> are reasonable, the resulting product is presumed to be the reasonable fee contemplated by \u00a7 1988. <em>Id. </em>at 897, 104 S.Ct. at 1548. <em>Pennsylvania, </em>\u2014 U.S. at ---, 106 S.Ct. at 3097-99.</p>\n<p id=\"b1342-19\">Plaintiffs presented the district court with evidence in addition to the affidavits of Mr. LaBarre to show that the claimed rates were in line with those prevailing in the community.<footnotemark>9</footnotemark> Plaintiffs also submitted records \u201csufficiently] detailed] that a neutral judge [could] make a fair evaluation of the time expended, the nature and need for the service, and the reasonable fees to be allowed.\u201d <em>Hensley, </em>461 U.S. at 441, 103 S.Ct. at 1943 (Burger, C.J., concurring). Yet the district judge made no finding on the sufficiency of the evidence. He applied an unsupported \u201crange\u201d hourly rate to a \u201crange\u201d of hours to arrive at a fee that he deemed reasonable.<footnotemark>10</footnotemark> While the district court is in the best position to judge the reasonableness of the fee award, <em>see Harmon v. San Diego County, </em>736 F.2d 1329, 1331 (9th Cir.1984) <em>(Harmon </em><page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"1267\">*1267</page-number><em>II), </em>\u201cjudges awarding fees must make certain that attorneys are paid the full value that their efforts would receive on the open market in non-civil-rights cases....\u201d <em>Hensley, </em>461 U.S. at 447, 103 S.Ct. at 1947 (citations omitted). We therefore reverse the award of attorneys\u2019 fees and remand for redetermination of a reasonable fee in accordance with this opinion.</p>\n<p id=\"b1343-7\">II. <em>Multiplier.</em></p>\n<p id=\"b1343-8\">Plaintiffs requested that the court upwardly adjust the fee awards by applying a multiplier of two. Plaintiffs argue that they are entitled to a multiplier on each matter because the issues were unpopular in the community and because of the risk that counsel would not be paid if plaintiffs did not succeed. The district court refused to award an upward enhancement, finding that one was not required. Although the district court did not explain the basis for this conclusion, we find that the district court did not abuse its discretion, because, based on the record before us, plaintiffs \u201cfailed to carry [their] burden of justifying entitlement to an upward adjustment.\u201d <em>Blum, </em>465 U.S. at 901-02, 104 S.Ct. at 1550. <em>See also Pennsylvania, </em>\u2014 U.S. at ---, 106 S.Ct. at 3099-3100.</p>\n<p id=\"b1343-9\">Plaintiffs introduced no evidence that an enhancement was necessary to provide fair and reasonable compensation. <em>See Blum </em>465 U.S. at 901, 104 S.Ct. at 1550 (upward adjustment is appropriate only where enhancement is necessary to provide fair and reasonable compensation). The 1-205 and the contempt matters sought enforcement of the protections provided by injunctive relief that plaintiffs had previously obtained. The risk<footnotemark>11</footnotemark> of non-payment due to lack of success was accordingly low. Public anger that the opening of a much-needed freeway section might be delayed by the prisoners\u2019 opposition does not constitute the sort of unpopularity that entitles a civil rights plaintiff to fee enhancement in the absence of evidence that plaintiffs or their counsel were adversely affected by that unpopularity. <em>See Planned Parenthood v. Arizona, </em>789 F.2d 1348, 1354 (9th Cir.1986). Plaintiffs have failed to show by specific evidence on the record that receipt of a reasonable hourly rate times the number of hours reasonably spent on these matters does not constitute a fully compensatory fee. <em>See id. See also Blum, </em>465 U.S. at 898-90, 104 S.Ct. at 1548-50. We, therefore, affirm the denial of a multiplier.</p>\n<p id=\"b1343-14\">This matter is remanded to the district court for a redetermination of a reasonable attorneys\u2019 fee to compensate plaintiffs\u2019 counsel for their efforts in the 1-205, contempt, and fee application matters. Plaintiffs are also entitled to a reasonable fee for their attorneys\u2019 services in prosecuting this appeal. On remand, the district court should determine the time spent and fees to be awarded on this appeal. <em>See Probe, </em>780 F.2d at 785-86; <em>Williams v. Alioto, </em>625 F.2d 845, 849-50 (9th Cir.1980) (per curiam), <em>cert. denied, </em>450 U.S. 1012, 101 S.Ct. 1723, 68 L.Ed.2d 213 (1981); <em>Rosenfeld v. Southern Pacific Co., </em>519 F.2d 527, 530 (9th Cir.1975) (allowing compensation for services rendered solely to obtain the allowance of attorney\u2019s fees). <em>See also Manhart v. City of Los Angeles, Dept. of Water &amp; Power, </em>652 F.2d 904, 909 (9th Cir.1981), <em>vacated on other grounds, </em>461 U.S. 951, 103 S.Ct. 2420, 77 L.Ed.2d 1310 (1983).</p>\n<p id=\"b1344-3\"><page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"1268\">*1268</page-number>AFFIRMED IN PART; REVERSED AND REMANDED IN PART.</p>\n<footnote label=\"1\">\n<p id=\"b1339-16\">. After entry of its original orders in this action, the district court retained jurisdiction in the case. In August 1982, the court <em>sua sponte </em>ordered the action to be dismissed, finding that it was no longer necessary to retain jurisdiction. Counsel for the plaintiff class successfully obtained reinstatement of the action. The district court denied plaintiffs' application for attorneys\u2019 fees in the amount of $3,312 for services relating to the reinstatement proceeding. Plaintiffs do not appeal that ruling.</p>\n</footnote>\n<footnote label=\"2\">\n<p id=\"b1339-23\">. Plaintiffs based their application for $160,130 in attorneys\u2019 fees on the current hourly rates billed by their counsel multiplied by the total <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"1264\">*1264</page-number>number of hours submitted, modified by a multiplier of two.</p>\n</footnote>\n<footnote label=\"3\">\n<p id=\"b1340-8\">. Mr. LaBarre's activities with regard to the 1-205 issue were undertaken because he believed his role as attorney for the class in an action over which the district court had retained jurisdiction imposed a \"watchdog\" function on him. When it became apparent that the 1-205 freeway might open before the inmates at RBJ could be moved to the new downtown facility, Mr. LaBarre was approached by \"a responsible public official privy to the facts.\u201d Mr. LaBarre undertook an investigation of the impact of the early opening of the freeway upon the inmates. However, neither the court nor Mr. LaBarre\u2019s client, the class, requested that he undertake the investigation.</p>\n<p id=\"ayq-dedup-0\">In the course of his activities with regard to the 1-205 issue, Mr. LaBarre obtained environmental data and had it analyzed, reviewed press clippings, responded to public officials and the press, attended public meetings, and negotiated with county officials. No motion or proceeding was brought before the court with regard to the 1-205 issue, which was not directly within the scope of the original order. While we commend Mr. LaBarre\u2019s diligence on behalf of his client class, we believe that, under the circumstances, it would have been appropriate for him to seek guidance from the court. <em>See Hensley v. Eckerhart, </em>461 U.S. 424, 447, 103 S.Ct. 1933, 1946-47, 76 L.Ed.2d 40 (1983) (Brennan, J., concurring in part, dissenting in part).</p>\n</footnote>\n<footnote label=\"4\">\n<p id=\"b1341-10\">. The <em>Johnson </em>court posited a twelve factors to be considered in calculating a reasonable attorneys\u2019 fee: (1) the time and labor required; (2) the novelty and difficulty of the questions; (3) the skill required; (4) the preclusion of other employment by the attorney; (5) the customary fee; (6) whether the fee is fixed or contingent; (7) time limitations imposed by the client or the circumstances; (8) the amount involved and the results obtained; (9) the experience, reputation, and ability of the attorneys; (10) the \"undesirability\" of the case; (11) the nature and length of the professional relationship with the client; and (12) awards in similar cases. <em>Johnson, </em>488 F.2d at 717-19. These factors derive directly from the American Bar Association Code of Professional Responsibility, Disciplinary Rule 2-106 (1980). <em>See Hensley, </em>461 U.S. at 430 n. 3, 103 S.Ct. at 1937 n. 3.</p>\n</footnote>\n<footnote label=\"5\">\n<p id=\"b1341-23\">. The lodestar is calculated by multiplying the hours spent by each attorney by a reasonable hourly rate. <em>Pennsylvania, </em>\u2014 U.S. at ---, 106 S.Ct. at 3095-97. Under the Third Circuit\u2019s approach, the court could then make adjustments to the lodestar figure based on the \"riskiness\u201d of the lawsuit and the quality of the attorney\u2019s work. <em>Id. </em>at ---, 106 S.Ct. at 3097-99. While this approach provided a more analytical framework for lower courts to follow than the <em>Johnson </em>factors, the Supreme Court noted that it could still produce inconsistent attorneys\u2019 fees awards. <em>Id.</em></p>\n</footnote>\n<footnote label=\"6\">\n<p id=\"b1342-8\">. Among the <em>Johnson </em>factors that cannot serve as independent bases for adjusting fee awards are: (1) the novelty and complexity of the issues, (2) the special skill and experience of counsel, (3) the quality of representation, and (4) the results obtained. <em>Blum v. Stenson, </em>465 U.S. 886, 898-900, 104 S.Ct. 1541, 1548-49, 79 L.Ed.2d 891 (1984), <em>Pennsylvania, </em>\u2014 U.S. at ---, 106 S.Ct. at 3097-99 (superior performance is not a proper basis for adjusting the lodestar).</p>\n</footnote>\n<footnote label=\"7\">\n<p id=\"b1342-9\">.

It is not sufficient for prevailing counsel to opine that all of the time claimed was usefully spent, and the district court should not uncritically accept counsel\u2019s representations concerning the time expended. <em>Sealey, Inc. v. Easy Living, Inc., </em>743 F.2d 1378, 1385 (9th Cir.1984). The fee claimant must show that the time spent was reasonably necessary and that its counsel made \"a good faith effort to exclude from [the] fee request hours that are excessive, redundant, or otherwise unnecessary.\" <em>Id. </em>at 1385 (quoting <em>Hensley v. Eckerhart, </em>461 U.S. 424, 434, 103 S.Ct. 1933, 1939-40, 76 L.Ed.2d 40 (1983)).</p>\n</footnote>\n<footnote label=\"9\">\n<p id=\"b1342-21\">. Plaintiffs submitted the affidavit of Charles J. Merten a member of the Oregon bar since 1963. In the affidavit, Mr. Merten states, \"I believe that these hourly rates are reasonable and consistent with those being charged by attorneys of comparable skill and experience on comparable matters in this community.\u201d While we do not consider here the sufficiency of the evidence necessary to support the claimed fee rate, we note that Mr. Merten did not indicate that the rates sought were comparable to his rates, and that plaintiffs did not submit evidence to support Mr. Merten\u2019s belief.</p>\n</footnote>\n<footnote label=\"10\">\n<p id=\"b1342-22\">. Even if the chosen ranges had been supported by the evidence, the district court offered no explanation why its award for the 1-205 services fell in the lower part of the chosen \"reasonable\u201d ranges, while the award for contempt services fell at the absolute bottom of its ranges. Thus plaintiffs sought compensation for 403.4 hours spent on the contempt proceeding; the district court found 300-400 hours to be in the reasonable range; yet the court appears to have awarded fees for only 300 hours.</p>\n</footnote>\n<footnote label=\"11\">\n<p id=\"b1343-10\">.
