RE, Chief Judge of the United States Court of International Trade, sitting by designation.</p>\n<opinion data-order=\"8\" data-type=\"opinion\" id=\"x999-1\" type=\"majority\">\n<author id=\"b96-7\">PER CURIAM:</author>\n<p id=\"b96-8\">After appellant\u2019s arrest on the basis of a complaint charging him with conspiracy to distribute heroin and distribution of heroin in violation of 21 U.S.C. \u00a7\u00a7 841(a), (b)(1)(A), 846 (1982), the government moved on February 14, 1986 pursuant to the Bail Reform Act of 1984, 18 U.S.C. \u00a7\u00a7 3141-3156, for an order detaining appellant without bail pending trial. In so moving, the government relied on the statutory presumptions of flight and dangerousness that arise when a judicial officer finds there is probable cause to believe the defendant has committed a federal drug-related offense for which a maximum prison sentence of ten years is prescribed. <em>See Id. </em>\u00a7 3142(e).</p>\n<p id=\"b96-9\">After a hearing, Magistrate Buchwald granted the government\u2019s motion, ruling that although appellant had rebutted the presumption of risk of flight, he failed to rebut the presumption of dangerousness. The United States District Court of the Southern District of New York, Robert L. Carter, <em>Judge, </em>reviewed appellant\u2019s bail status on three occasions, the most recent of which occurred at a hearing on July 17, 1985, during which the government presented extensive testimonial evidence concerning appellant\u2019s engagement in criminal activity-including hijacking, extortion, and narcotics distribution \u2014 over a five year period. At the conclusion of the hearing, Judge Carter ordered that appellant be detained pending trial because of dangerousness.</p>\n<p id=\"b96-11\">Appellant now ehall\u00e9nges the constitutionality of his pretrial detention, relying upon <em>United States v. Salerno, </em>794 F.2d 64, 71 (2d Cir.1986). There, a majority of the panel held that substantive due process prohibits pretrial detention on the ground of danger to the community, regardless of the duration of the detention. <em>See id. </em>at 71.</p>\n<p id=\"b96-12\">Accordingly, we are constrained to vacate Judge Carter\u2019s order of pretrial detention and remand the matter to the district court to set appropriate conditions of bail. However, because the issuance of the mandate in <em>Salerno </em>was stayed pending application by the government to the Supreme Court for a writ of certiorari, <em>see </em>Fed.R. App.P. 41, we withhold issuance of the mandate in this appeal pending issuance of the mandate in <em>Salerno. See United States v. Frisone, </em>795 F.2d 1, 2 (2d Cir.1986).</p>\n<p id=\"b96-13\">Vacated and remanded with instructions.</p>\n</opinion>\n</casebody>\n",
