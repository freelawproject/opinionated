Appellants Steven J. Sawyer, a principal of SMC, and Alan C. Leavitt, an SMC <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"1498\">*1498</page-number>salesman, were convicted after a jury trial on eleven counts of mail and wire fraud, 18 U.S.C. \u00a7\u00a7 1341 and 1343 (1982); commodity fraud, 7 U.S.C. \u00a7\u00a7 6o(1) and 13(b) (1982); interstate transportation of a security taken by fraud, 18 U.S.C. \u00a7 2314 (1982); and one count of conspiracy under 18 U.S.C. \u00a7 371 (1982). Prior to trial, appellant Harvey M. Bloch, SMC\u2019s president, entered a conditional plea of guilty to one count of commodity fraud and one count of conspiracy. Appellants raise the following issues on appeal: (1) whether the evidence was sufficient to support the convictions of Sawyer and Leavitt; (2) whether the district court abused its discretion by denying Sawyer\u2019s and Leavitt\u2019s motions for severance; (3) whether the district court abused its discretion in certain evidentiary rulings; (4) whether the district court erred in refusing to grant judicial use immunity for a proposed witness of Sawyers\u2019; (5) whether the government\u2019s opening statement constituted prosecutorial misconduct requiring reversal of Sawyer\u2019s conviction; (6) whether the district court erred in denying Bloch\u2019s motion to suppress evidence seized pursuant to the execution of a search warrant at SMC; and (7) whether Bloch\u2019s guilty plea was involuntary. Finding no error, we affirm.</p>\n<p id=\"b1550-4\">I. BACKGROUND</p>\n<p id=\"b1550-5\">On March 8, 1983, a grand jury in the Southern District of Florida returned an eighteen count indictment charging appellants and four codefendants <footnotemark>2</footnotemark> with devising and promoting a scheme to defraud members of the public who were induced to invest in commodity pools operated by SMC. The indictment specifically charged that the defendants falsely represented that SMC\u2019s commodity pools operated profitably and involved relatively low risk, when in fact, the great majority of the pools lost money; and that they intentionally concealed information regarding SMC\u2019s operating losses, large commissions and fees charged, and the actual value of investors\u2019 accounts. It was further charged that a false and misleading disclosure statement was distributed to SMC\u2019s investors. The evidence at the ensuing twenty-four day trial, which included the testimony of appellant Bloch, various SMC employees, SMC\u2019s lawyer and a parade of disgruntled SMC investors, provided the following background on SMC\u2019s troubled history and operations.</p>\n<p id=\"b1550-9\">The SMC saga began in 1979 when Bloch, a former New York restauranteur, was invited to Florida to join a commodities business that his cousin, appellant Steven J. Sawyer was putting together. Early in 1980, Bloch became Sawyer\u2019s partner in a branch office of David H. Siegel &amp; Company (DHS), a commodities pool operation. Bloch held the title of vice-president; David Siegel was the trader; William Zipkin and appellant Leavitt were in sales; and Sawyer was in charge of administration. Sie-gel and Michael King also owned SMC, which was not in use, thought it had a Futures Commission Merchant license.<footnotemark>3</footnotemark> This license, which DHS did not have, would allow SMC to solicit individual clients for individual commodities accounts, rather than just for pools. In June of 1980, Sawyer arranged for Bloch to purchase one hundred percent of SMC stock from Siegel and King. Bloch thus became SMC\u2019s sole record shareholder and its president. Bloch testified, however, that he and Sawyer were actually partners with Sawyer getting sixty percent of the profits and assets of SMC. There was no written document to this effect as Sawyer told Bloch he did not want to be a named owner of SMC because of personal problems, including the pendency of a million dollar lawsuit and other matters unrelated to the commodities business.</p>\n<p id=\"b1551-3\"><page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"1499\">*1499</page-number>After Bloch\u2019s acquisition of SMC, it replaced DHS but kept the same offices and employees. SMC began actively doing business in July 1980. Reflecting his controlling interest, Sawyer was integrally involved in SMC\u2019s operations from routine matters of office administration to matters of financial management. The latter included setting up SMC\u2019s sales programs; hiring salesmen; setting commissions; reviewing salesmen\u2019s performances and scripts used in sales solicitations; keeping track of money coming in from investors; and, thereafter, determining which dissatisfied investors should receive a return of their management fees. Sawyer also disbursed corporate funds and used them as his own.</p>\n<p id=\"b1551-4\">SMC employed about one hundred twenty salesmen who solicited investors and sold interests via Watts lines in two kinds of commodity contracts, long-term futures pools<footnotemark>4</footnotemark> and managed account pools,<footnotemark>5</footnotemark> through the use of \u201cboiler-room\u201d sales tactics, <em>see supra </em>n. 1. Salesmen attended daily motivational sales meetings held by Bloch. They were eligible to win prizes for sales performance such as silver dollars, Krugerrands, or leased Cadillacs. During the course of one of Bloch\u2019s meetings, which was taped and played at trial, Bloch was heard to say that customers would be led to the slaughterhouse, and that salesmen should avoid direct questions from customers and keep their answers in the \u201cgray\u201d area.</p>\n<p id=\"b1551-10\">In December of 1980, Sawyer and Bloch learned that SMC had incurred huge losses as a result of David Siegel\u2019s unsuccessful trades. Siegel was fired and Michael King was hired as the trader. King would subsequently prove as unsuccessful a trader as Siegel. Initially, Bloch and Sawyer thought the SMC pools had suffered losses of $200,000; by February 1981, they discovered that the pools had lost over $954,-000.00 in 1980. Sawyer and Bloch never informed their salesmen, their investors<footnotemark>6</footnotemark> or the Commodities Futures Trading Commission (CFTC) of the amount or nature of these losses.</p>\n<p id=\"b1551-11\">In January 1981, Bloch directed that SMC\u2019s pools be consolidated into a smaller number of large pools. Investor\u2019s funds were transferred into these pools without their authorization or knowledge, and frequently, contrary to their instructions.<footnotemark>7</footnotemark> In spite of SMC\u2019s losses, in February of 1981, Sawyer gave Bloch a check payable to Bloch in the amount of $50,000.00, which they cashed and split sixty/forty\u2014 $30,000.00 for Sawyer, $20,000.00 for Bloch. In addition, numerous SMC checks <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"1500\">*1500</page-number>were written to Score Realty, a company from whose account Sawyer paid his personal bills. There were checks to Sawyer\u2019s wife, his mother-in-law, his children\u2019s live-in governess, his maid and a female friend, none of whom performed any services for SMC.</p>\n<p id=\"b1552-4\">Numerous investor complaints began coming into SMC. Investors complained that they were in the wrong pools, not in pools at all when they thought they were in, or that they did not know the net asset value (NAY) of their account and could not get that information. In particular, a number of complaints came in with respect to salesman Philip Gold. Gold consistently told his customers that their accounts had made money when, in fact, they lost money, and frequently were not even in the market. Gold also told his customers that they had purchased managed accounts with a ten percent management fee, and not futures pools which were charged a commission of between thirty-five and forty percent. He also concealed the poor performance of the SMC pools. At one point, around August or September of 1981, Bloch tried to fire Gold for lying to customer Richard Lassig. Shortly thereafter, however, Sawyer intervened, telling Bloch that Gold knew what he was doing and that Gold was staying and would report to Sawyer. In the middle of the sales room, Sawyer remarked that Bloch did not know how to handle Gold, and that Gold should go directly to Sawyer with any problems. In February 1982, Bloch tried once again to fire Gold for lying to customer Joseph Oli-vio, who had made a tape recording of Gold\u2019s misrepresentations. Sawyer said he would handle the problem and reinstated Gold, advising him to come to him if there were any more problems. Gold remained at SMC under Sawyer\u2019s supervision and sold pool interests to sixty-one investors after Sawyer defeated Bloch\u2019s attempts to fire him.</p>\n<p id=\"b1552-5\">Four salesmen, including appellant Leav-itt were assigned by Sawyer and Bloch to handle investor complaints. One SMC salesman testified that it was his understanding that these complaint \u201cspecialists\u201d were supposed to mislead investors. At times, Sawyer and Bloch also handled complaints. When Sawyer did take calls from investors, he frequently used the aliases Sloan and Stern, Bloch would use the aliases Boatwright and Lehrer. In addition, each also sold to investors, with Sawyer responsible for handling the accounts of SMC\u2019s largest investors, Carl and Mary Lou Schulte and her brother Michael Kneifl. Sawyer personally solicited several hundred thousand dollars from both the Schultes and Kneifl but at no time did he tell them of the huge losses SMC\u2019s pools had suffered nor the money they were losing on their accounts. Sawyer\u2019s secretary testified that Sawyer said he could not believe the Schultes were dumb enough to keep putting their money in SMC.</p>\n<p id=\"b1552-8\">In March 1981, attorney John Field was retained to deal with matters between SMC and the CFTC. From his observations of SMC salesmen, Field believed they did not understand how commodity pools operated. He, therefore, suggested to Bloch that SMC establish a compliance taping program, which is used by many commodities firms to ensure that customers understand the terms of investment contracts, including management fees and the risks involved in investing in commodities. Field prepared an outline for the compliance call and SMC began compliance taping in July 1981. Racquel Gil usually conducted the taping. She would call the investor and confirm the required information using a script. At one point, Sawyer decided that there was too much investor participation on the tapes, and he changed the script. Gil testified that she lied to investors about the number of brokers and traders at SMC and the management fees. She told people they were in the market before they really were, and she told them that their accounts had higher NAV\u2019s than they had. If asked a hard question, she turned off the tape.</p>\n<p id=\"b1552-9\">Field was also asked to help revise SMC\u2019s existing disclosure statement.<footnotemark>8</footnotemark> <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"1501\">*1501</page-number>Field suggested that the statement be amended to include a \u201ctrack record\u201d<footnotemark>9</footnotemark> and to disclose Sawyer as a \u201cprincipal\u201d<footnotemark>10</footnotemark> of SMC. A revised disclosure statement was subsequently prepared which correctly disclosed that Sawyer was a principal, and that SMC had operated pools over the past year, and which detailed SMC\u2019s trading results. It also revealed that SMC had reparations proceedings filed against it and that Sawyer had been the subject of a consent decree for a CFTC violation and paid a fine.<footnotemark>11</footnotemark> Bloch and Sawyer, who reviewed the statement, expressed concern over disclosing SMC\u2019s heavy trading losses. Sawyer made extensive changes and revisions. Following Sawyer\u2019s revisions and after consultation with Field, SMC filed a revised statement with the CFTC in February 1982. At Sawyer\u2019s direction, however, any reference to him or to reparations filed against SMC were deleted. This disclosure statement was never sent to prospective investors.</p>\n<p id=\"b1553-9\">II. SUFFICIENCY OF THE EVIDENCE</p>\n<p id=\"b1553-10\">Appellants Sawyer and Leavitt contend that the evidence was insufficient to support their convictions. Our review of the government\u2019s evidence is limited to a determination as to whether \u201ca reasonable trier of fact could find that the evidence establishes guilt beyond a reasonable doubt.\u201d <em>United States v. Bell, </em>678 F.2d 547, 549 (5th Cir. Unit B 1982) (en banc) (footnote omitted),<footnotemark>12</footnotemark> <em>aff'd on other grounds, </em>462 U.S. 356, 103 S.Ct. 2398, 76 L.Ed.2d 638 (1983). It is not required that the evidence \u201cexclude every reasonable hypothesis of innocence or be wholly inconsistent with every conclusion except that of guilt.\u201d <em>Id. </em>All evidence must be viewed in the light most favorable to the government, and all reasonable inferences must be drawn in favor of supporting the jury\u2019s verdict. <em>Glasser v. United States, </em>315 U.S. 60, 80, 62 S.Ct. 457, 469, 86 L.Ed. 680 (1942).</p>\n<p id=\"b1553-11\">To warrant conviction under the mail and wire fraud statutes, the government must prove that the defendant partici<page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"1502\">*1502</page-number>pated in a scheme to defraud involving the use of the mails or interstate communications in furtherance of the scheme. <em>See, e.g., United States v. Hewes, </em>729 F.2d 1302, 1320 (11th Cir.1984) (mail fraud), <em>cert. denied, Caldwell v. U.S., </em>469 U.S. 1110, 105 S.Ct. 790, 83 L.Ed.2d 783 (1985); <em>United States v. Cowart, </em>595 F.2d 1023, 1031 n. 10 (5th Cir.1979) (wire fraud).<footnotemark>13</footnotemark> These are also the essential elements under the transportation of a security obtained by fraud and fraud by a commodity pool operator statutes. Fraudulent conduct that will establish a \u201cscheme to defraud\u201d includes knowingly making false representations, <em>United States v. Scott, </em>701 F.2d 1340, 1344 (11th Cir.), <em>cert. denied, </em>464 U.S. 856, 104 S.Ct. 175, 78 L.Ed.2d 158 (1983), or concealing material facts, <em>United States v. O\u2019Malley, </em>707 F.2d 1240, 1247 (11th Cir.1983). It also includes statements made with reckless indifference to their truth or falsity. <em>United States v. Frick, </em>588 F.2d 531, 536 (5th Cir.), <em>cert. denied, </em>441 U.S. 913, 99 S.Ct. 2013, 60 L.Ed.2d 385 (1979). Taking the evidence as a whole, we find it was more than sufficient for the jury to find that Sawyer and Leavitt participated in a scheme to defraud investors in SMC through misrepresentation and concealment of material facts.</p>\n<p id=\"b1554-4\">1. Steven Sawyer</p>\n<p id=\"b1554-5\">Sawyer argues that the government held him responsible for SMC\u2019s fraudulent activity solely by attempting to prove he was a principal at SMC. He asserts that the government never proved that Sawyer willfully participated in a scheme with knowledge of its fraudulent nature. Sawyer says he was a mere consultant at SMC, not a principal, and argues that even if he was a principal, he is not liable for the acts of SMC salesmen. These arguments, however, are meritless. Sawyer is liable because of his fraudulent conduct, not his position as a principal. The evidence shows he set up, supervised and benefitted from the fraudulent sales program from its inception, ratified and encouraged Philip Gold\u2019s fraud, defrauded the Schultes and Kneifl, and was instrumental in the dissem-\u00a1nation of SMC\u2019s deceptive disclosure statement. Sawyer helped establish and control SMC, receiving more money, directly for his benefit, than any other individual.</p>\n<p id=\"b1554-9\">The evidence is clear that instead of instructing the sales force to tell the truth when he learned that SMC\u2019s pre-1981 pools lost over $900,000, Sawyer remained silent. Despite knowing these facts, the evidence shows Sawyer drafted a letter to be sent to investors that attributed the failure to inform them of their accounts to SMC\u2019s new computer program. The correspondence never informed investors about the poor performance of SMC\u2019s pools. [Sawyer also personally defrauded the Schultes and Kneifl by directly soliciting their investments but never telling them about SMC\u2019s losses or the deteriorating value of their accounts.^</p>\n<p id=\"b1554-10\">Although Sawyer asserts he is not responsible for the fraudulent practices of the salesmen, he ignores the Philip Gold episodes, when on two separate occasions, Sawyer rehired Gold after Bloch had fired him for lying to investors, Lassig and Oli-vio. Sawyer severely criticized Bloch, not Gold, for these incidents. Under Sawyer\u2019s supervision, Gold continued to lie to more customers. Sawyer knew of Gold\u2019s misconduct and explicitly assumed responsibility for any problem involving Gold.</p>\n<p id=\"b1554-11\">The evidence at trial further established that Sawyer, using the aliases Sloan and Stern, responded to inquiries of other customers. Although Sawyer argues there are no \u201cbadges of fraud\u201d on his conduct, courts have recognized that the use of aliases when dealing with the public is a \u201cbadge of fraud.\u201d <em>See e.g., United States v. Pearlstein, </em>576 F.2d 531, 535 (3d Cir.1978) (use of aliases as circumstantial evidence of conscious deception). Finally, the evidence at trial firmly establishes Sawyer\u2019s central role in drafting the disclosure statement. He personally reviewed the drafts as soon as they came out of the typewriter and deleted material disclosures that SMC\u2019s attorney directed him to put in <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"1503\">*1503</page-number>the document, including his role as a principal at SMC. Through the false disclosure statements, Sawyer concealed from investors that the pools suffered severe losses, that Sawyer was subject to a CFTC consent decree and that there were numerous claims filed against SMC. This concealment created a fraudulent appearance that SMC was a profitable, successful, well-run company. Concealment of such material information from investors constitutes fraud. <em>United States v. O\u2019Malley, </em>707 F.2d at 1247.</p>\n<p id=\"b1555-4\">2. Alan Leavitt</p>\n<p id=\"b1555-5\">The evidence shows Leavitt personally defrauded at least three investors, Lola Dugger, Reverend Clayton and Richard Lassig, by misrepresenting profits and concealing actual losses of SMC\u2019s pools. Leavitt argues that since he did not make the initial fraudulent representations to Dugger and Clayton, he cannot be held responsible. However, Leavitt defrauded Dugger and Clayton in two ways: (1) he misled them to induce them not to withdraw their funds in order to allow SMC\u2019s brokerage commissions to dissipate their accounts for several additional months; and (2) he fraudulently attempted to solicit additional funds from each investor.</p>\n<p id=\"b1555-6\">From the net asset value (NAV) print outs on Raquel Gil\u2019s desk that Leavitt examined on a daily basis, Leavitt was aware of the losses of SMC\u2019s pools. Yet Leavitt told Dugger that she was up $1633 when, in fact, she had lost over $5000. Leavitt also falsely told Dugger she owned individual futures contracts. He aggressively sought more money from Dugger, recommending that she borrow another $20,000 in order to make \u201creal money.\u201d He never told her that her account, and SMC\u2019s pools, were losing money. Leavitt lied to Clayton to induce him to keep his money in SMC, saying SMC\u2019s managed accounts did 77 percent last year, when, in fact, they lost money. Leavitt\u2019s statements to Clayton, that SMC\u2019s managed accounts had made money in the past and that the reason for the large brokerage commissions was the small number of participants in the pool, were similarly false and fraudulent.</p>\n<p id=\"b1555-8\">Finally, Leavitt defrauded investor Richard Lassig by telling him that his account was up to $1100, $1937 and $1600 on three separate days, when, in fact, Lassig had no account and was not in the market until October 9, 1981. Leavitt blames Bloch and Raquel Gil for placing Lassig in a long term futures pool rather than the managed account pool Leavitt promised him. The evidence is otherwise, however, since Leav-itt wrote the Lassig order ticket placing him in the long term futures Metals pool on October 2, 1981. In so doing, Leavitt and Gold split a higher commission from Lassig than they would have on the managed account pool, the investment originally offered.</p>\n<p id=\"b1555-9\">Leavitt asserts he should not be held liable for mere \u201cpuffing\u201d or over enthusiasm. However, Leavitt was held liable not for mere predictions, but rather for the lies he told investors about facts such as the value of their investments, the profits already made, and the nature of their accounts and fees. Such deliberate misrepresentations are not \u201cpuffing\u201d but fraud. <em>Manufacturing Research Corp. v. Greenlee Tool Co., </em>693 F.2d 1037, 1040-41 (11th Cir.1982). The district court granted Leavitt\u2019s request for a \u201cpuffing\u201d instruction. At most, therefore, Leavitt\u2019s claim of simple \u201cpuffing\u201d was an alternate hypothesis of the evidence which the jury had the right to consider and reject. <em>See Bell, </em>678 F.2d at 549.</p>\n<p id=\"b1555-10\">III. SEVERANCE</p>\n<p id=\"b1555-11\">Appellants Sawyer and Leavitt contend that the district court abused its discretion in refusing to grant their motions for severance under Fed.R.Crim.P. 14. Both argue that the mutually antagonistic defenses presented by SMC\u2019s management and salesmen created prejudice resulting in an unfair trial. Leavitt also claims that he suffered additional prejudice due to his inability to call codefendants at trial to give exculpatory testimony, and by the spillover effect of damaging testimony concerning codefendant Philip Gold. We disagree.</p>\n<p id=\"b1556-3\"><page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"1504\">*1504</page-number>We note at the outset the general rule that coconspirators should be tried jointly. <em>United States v. Esle, </em>743 F.2d 1465, 1476 (11th Cir.1984). Under Fed.R. Crim.P. 14, the decision to deny a severance lies within the sound discretion of the trial judge, <em>United States v. Berkowitz, </em>662 F.2d 1127, 1132 (5th Cir. Unit B 1981), and absent a clear showing of abuse it will not be overturned on appeal, <em>United States v. Pepe, </em>747 F.2d 632, 649 (11th Cir.1984). Rule 14 requires a trial judge in reaching his decision, to balance the prejudice inherent in a joint trial against the interests of judicial economy and efficiency. <em>Id. </em>Therefore, to establish an abuse of discretion requiring severance, appellants must demonstrate that they \u201csuffered compelling prejudice against which the trial court was unable to afford protection.\u201d <em>United States v. Riola, </em>694 F.2d 670, 672 (11th Cir.) (quoting <em>United States v. Berkowitz, </em>662 F.2d at 1132), <em>cert. denied, </em>460 U.S. 1073, 103 S.Ct. 1532, 78 L.Ed.2d 117 (1983).</p>\n<p id=\"b1556-4\">To meet the test of compelling prejudice based upon antagonistic defenses, the defenses must be \u201cmutually exclusive ... or irreconcilable.\u201d <em>United States v. Riola, </em>694 F.2d at 672 (quoting <em>United States v. Berkowitz, </em>662 F.2d at 1133). The defenses reach that level of antagonism \u201cif the jury, in order to believe the core of testimony offered on behalf of [one] defendant, must necessarily disbelieve the testimony offered on behalf of his co-defendant.\u201d <em>United States v. Berkowitz, </em>662 F.2d at 1134. \u201cUltimately the test is whether the defendant received a fair trial.\u201d <em>Id.</em></p>\n<p id=\"b1556-5\">Appellants argue that the essence of each defense was to attempt to shift the blame for fraudulent activity either to the salesmen or to management, and to minimize the involvement of the individual concerned. However, while these defenses may be antagonistic, they do not satisfy the <em>Berkowitz </em>test of being irreconciliable or mutually exclusive. The record shows that appellants attempted to demonstrate their own limited involvement in the affairs of SMC by pointing to others in the firm with more specific knowledge or control, particularly targeting the government\u2019s witness Harvey Bloch. These defenses, however, would not have required the jury to find either appellant guilty of the fraudulent activity. The jury could consistently have accepted both Sawyer\u2019s defense that he had no responsibility for sales and trading and Leavitt\u2019s defense that as a mere salesman he only followed the instructions of SMC\u2019s management. The jury, instead, could have rejected the government\u2019s case and found Harvey Bloch fully responsible. \u201cIn short, \u2018[t]he jury could have believed both [sets of] defendants' theories of defense.\u2019 \u201d <em>United States v. Magdaniel-Mora, </em>746 F.2d 715, 720 (11th Cir.1984) (quoting <em>United States v. Stephenson, </em>708 F.2d 580, 582 (11th Cir.1983)); <em>cf; United States v. Crawford, </em>581 F.2d 489 (5th Cir.1978); <em>United States v. Johnson, </em>478 F.2d 1129 (5th Cir.1973). Appellants have, therefore, failed to establish the \u2018compelling prejudice\u2019 necessary to warrant severance.</p>\n<p id=\"b1556-7\">We also reject appellant Leavitt\u2019s additional claims of prejudice resulting from his inability to call codefendants on his behalf and prejudicial spillover. As regards the former claim, Leavitt asserts that had he been tried separately, he would have introduced testimony from his codefendants that he had followed the internal company policies at SMC and never misled any investors. However, as our predecessor court noted in <em>Tillman v. United States, </em>406 F.2d 930, 936 (5th Cir.) (quoting <em>Smith v. United States, </em>385 F.2d 34, 38 (5th Cir.1967)), <em>vacated in part, </em>395 U.S. 830, 89 S.Ct. 2143, 23 L.Ed.2d 742 (1969), \u201c[a]n intention of the movant to have his codefendant testify has never been considered grounds for severance.\u201d In order to warrant severance based on a codefendant\u2019s potential testimony, a defendant must \u201cdemonstrate (1) a bona fide need for the testimony, (2) the substance of the testimony, (3) its exculpatory nature and effect and (4) that the co-defendant will in fact testify if the cases are severed....\u201d <em>United States v. Pepe, </em>747 F.2d at 651 n. 20 (quoting <em>United States v. DeSimone, </em>660 F.2d 532, 539 (5th Cir. Unit B 1981), <em>cert. denied, </em>455 U.S. 1027, 102 S.Ct. 1732, 72 <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"1505\">*1505</page-number>L.Ed.2d 149 (1982)). Leavitt has failed to meet these requirements. In his proffer, offered for the first time on appeal, he indicates neither whom he would call on his behalf nor the likelihood that such testimony would be forthcoming. Moreover, he presents no \u201cspecific exonerative facts,\u201d <em>United States v. Pepe, </em>747 F.2d at 651, to which any codefendant would testify, beyond the mere assertion that codefendants would be able to testify that Leavitt had no fraudulent intent.</p>\n<p id=\"b1557-5\">Leavitt\u2019s second claim of prejudice based on the spillover effect of testimony concerning codefendant Gold is similarly unavailing. Leavitt specifically objects to statements which SMC saleswoman Mary Jane Seide testified were made by codefendant Gold. Twice, Seide testified that Gold had remarked to her and others that they were working for a \u201cscam.\u201d On both occasions, the trial court granted Leavitt\u2019s motions to strike the testimony, and gave the jury instructions to disregard it. The trial also polled the jury individually to be sure each member could disregard that statement. Seide also testified that Gold referred to himself as \u201cDr. Gold.\u201d When asked why he did so, she testified Gold had told her, that \u201chis specialty was performing cashierrectomies, which is the removal of money from one person\u2019s pocket to another.\u201d The court, however, struck the phrase \u201cwhich is the removal of money from one person\u2019s pocket to another,\u201d allowing only the balance of the statement to come in.</p>\n<p id=\"b1557-6\">In determining whether Leavitt was unfairly prejudiced by the testimony in question, the applicable test is whether, \u201cunder all the circumstances of the particular case ... the jurors [were able] to follow the court\u2019s admonitory instructions and accordingly to collate and appraise the independent evidence against each defendant solely upon that defendant\u2019s own acts, statements and conduct.\u201d <em>United States v. Cole, </em>755 F.2d 748, 762 (11th Cir.1985) (quoting <em>Tillman, </em>406 F.2d at 935). Based on the record before us we are satisfied that Leavitt has failed to demonstrate the requisite compelling prejudice. Certainly by striking the \u201cscam\u201d references, excluding parts of the \u201cDr. Gold\u201d testimony and cautioning the jury not to consider these statements in its deliberations, the court was able to \u201cafford protection\u201d against any unfair prejudice to Gold\u2019s codefendants. <em>See United States v. Berkowitz, </em>662 F.2d at 1132. Moreover, the fact that after five days of deliberations, the jury convicted three of the defendants while acquitting two others satisfies us that the jurors were able to follow the court\u2019s admonitory instructions and evaluate the evidence separately and independently against each defendant. <em>See United States v. Cole, </em>755 F.2d at 762; <em>Tillman, </em>406 F.2d at 936. Accordingly, we find no abuse of discretion in the district court\u2019s denial of appellant\u2019s motions for severance.</p>\n<p id=\"b1557-8\">IV. EVIDENTIARY RULINGS</p>\n<p id=\"adm-dedup-0\">Leavitt claims he was denied a fair trial by: (1) the failure of the district court to grant a mistrial when Mary Jane Seide testified about the statements made by Gold; and (2) the admission into evidence of appellant\u2019s handwritten notes concerning his conversations with SMC clients. We reject both claims.</p>\n<p id=\"b1557-9\">1. The Seide Testimony</p>\n<p id=\"ApEW\">Seide\u2019s testimony about \u201cDr. Gold\u201d and his characterization of SMC as a \u201cscam\u201d did not require the district court to declare a mistrial. As previously discussed, to prevent any unfair prejudice to the other defendants, the court struck the \u201cscam\u201d references, excluded parts of the \u201cDr. Gold\u201d testimony, and cautioned the jury not to consider these statements in its deliberations. In <em>United States v. Tenorio-Angel, </em>756 F.2d 1505 (11th Cir.1985) we restated the rule in this circuit regarding evidence withdrawn from the jury:</p>\n<blockquote id=\"b1557-10\">An instruction to disregard evidence withdrawn from the jury is sufficient grounds for an appellate court to uphold a trial court\u2019s denial of a motion for mistrial unless the evidence is so highly prejudicial as to be incurable by the trial court\u2019s admonition. Such a level of prejudicial effect exists where there is a \u2018significant possibility ... that ... the <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"1506\">*1506</page-number>stricken statement had a substantial impact upon the verdict of the jury.\u2019</blockquote>\n<p id=\"b1558-4\"><em>Id. </em>at 1512 (quoting <em>United States v. Slocum, 708 </em>F.2d 587, 598 (11th Cir.1983)) (citations omitted).</p>\n<p id=\"b1558-5\">Although Leavitt argues that the introduction of Seide\u2019s testimony was a \u201cdeliberate attempt to prejudice [him] in the eyes of the jury,\u201d we find that any potential prejudice concerning Gold\u2019s statements would have affected all of the defendants. The fact, therefore, that the jury acquitted two defendants, while convicting the others leads us to conclude the jury did not allow the statements in question to influence its verdicts improperly. Accordingly, we find the district court did not err in refusing to grant a mistrial.</p>\n<p id=\"b1558-6\">2. Leavitt\u2019s Handwritten Notes</p>\n<p id=\"b1558-7\">Leavitt prepared and maintained handwritten notes documenting his conversations with SMC investors! The notes concerning two of those investors \u2014 Richard Lassig and Lola Dugger \u2014 were admitted into evidence, under Fed.R.Evid. 801(d)(2)(A) as an admission against a party opponent. Leavitt argues that two sentences in these notes, where he had written that Dugger was a \u201cpain in the ass\u201d and that he had her \u201ceating out of [his] hand,\u201d were highly prejudicial and distracted the jury from the real issues and, therefore, should have been excluded under Fed.R. Evid. 403.</p>\n<p id=\"b1558-8\">Because Rule 403 permits a trial court to exclude probative evidence, it is an extraordinary remedy which \u201cshould be applied sparingly.\u201d <em>United States v. Cole, </em>755 F.2d 748, 766 (11th Cir.1985). The standard in this Circuit for exclusion of evidence under Rule 403 is clear:</p>\n<blockquote id=\"b1558-9\">Relevant evidence is inherently prejudicial; but it is only <em>unfair </em>prejudice <em>substantially </em>outweighing probative value, which permits exclusion of relevant matter under Rule 403. Unless trials are to be conducted on scenarios, on unreal facts tailored and sanitized for the occasion, the application of Rule 403 must be cautious and sparing. Its major function is limited to excluding matter of scant or cumulative probative force, dragged in by the heels for the sake of its prejudicial effect.</blockquote>\n<p id=\"b1558-12\"><em>United States v. Thevis, </em>665 F.2d 616, 633-634 (5th Cir. Unit B) (quoting <em>United States v. McRae, </em>593 F.2d 700 (5th Cir.), <em>cert. denied, </em>444 U.S. 862, 100 S.Ct. 128, 62 L.Ed.2d 83 (1979)), <em>cert. denied, </em>456 U.S. 1008, 102 S.Ct. 2300, 73 L.Ed.2d 1303 (1982). \u201cIn making this decision, the trial court has broad discretion which is reviewable only for abuse.\u201d <em>Id.</em></p>\n<p id=\"b1558-13\">Based on this standard, we are unpersuaded that the district court abused its discretion in admitting the notes. Contrary to appellant\u2019s assertion, both challenged statements are probative of his motive, intent and knowledge concerning the fraudulent conduct with which he was charged. <em>See United States v. McDonald, </em>576 F.2d 1350, 1356 (9th Cir.), <em>cert. denied, </em>439 U.S. 927, 99 S.Ct. 312, 58 L.Ed.2d 320 (1978) (defendant\u2019s statement to the effect that persons investing in high risk ventures \u201cdeserved to be screwed\u201d admissible to show motive, intent and knowledge). We do not find that any prejudice resulting to Leavitt \u201csubstantially\u201d outweighed this probative value.</p>\n<p id=\"b1558-14\">V. JUDICIAL USE IMMUNITY</p>\n<p id=\"b1558-15\">Sawyer sought to call as his sole witness David Siegel, the trader who was responsible for SMC\u2019s losses in 1980 of approximately $900,000.00. Siegel, however, asserted his fifth amendment right against self-incrimination and refused to testify. The district court denied Sawyer\u2019s subsequent motion to provide judicial immunity for Siegel or to compel the government to do so. Sawyer\u2019s argument that this was error is meritless.</p>\n<p id=\"b1558-16\">In <em>United States v. Thevis, </em>665 F.2d 616, 639 (5th Cir. Unit B), <em>cert. denied, </em>456 U.S. 1008, 102 S.Ct. 2300, 73 L.Ed.2d 1303 (1982), our predecessor court, after considering various policy arguments, concluded that district courts have no authority to grant immunity to a defense witness simply because that witness may possess exculpatory information. We are bound by <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"1507\">*1507</page-number>the decision in <em>Thevis, United States v. Gottesman, </em>724 F.2d 1517, 1524 (11th Cir.1984), and accordingly find no error in the court\u2019s refusal to grant Siegel use immunity. Moreover, although we recognized in <em>Gottesman </em>that a compelling argument could be made for judicially compelled use immunity in cases of governmental abuse of the immunity process, we declined to address that argument because we found no evidence of such misconduct. <em>Id. </em>at n. 9. We likewise find no evidence of governmental abuse in the handling of the immunity process in the instant case.</p>\n<p id=\"b1559-4\">VI. PROSECUTORIAL MISCONDUCT</p>\n<p id=\"ArDn\">Sawyer also asserts that in its opening statement the government engaged in pros-ecutorial misconduct requiring reversal. Sawyer challenges the remark made at the conclusion of the prosecutor\u2019s statement, when he informed the jury that: \u201cYou will hear evidence that Steven Sawyer told a representative of the CFTC in 1982, that Steven Sawyer was guilty.\u201d No confession was ever introduced nor did the government offer any evidence at trial that Sawyer made this statement to anyone in 1982 or at any other time.<footnotemark>14</footnotemark> Sawyer did not object or move to strike this statement and he did not request a mistrial on this basis.</p>\n<p id=\"b1559-5\">We note at the outset that because Sawyer never moved for a mistrial or requested cautionary instructions at trial, he is entitled to a reversal of his conviction only if the prosecutorial conduct in question constitutes plain error under Fed.R.Crim.P. 52(b). See <em>United States v. Lacayo, </em>758 F.2d 1559, 1564 (11th Cir.), <em>cert. denied, </em>\u2014 U.S. -, 106 S.Ct. 568, 88 L.Ed.2d 553 (1985). The Supreme Court has recently emphasized, in a case involving prosecutorial misconduct, that the \u201cplain error\u201d rule should be used sparingly and invoked only when a review of the entire record convinces the court that \u201ca miscarriage of justice would otherwise result.\u201d <em>United States v. Young, </em>470 U.S. 1, 105 S.Ct. 1038, 1047, 84 L.Ed.2d 1 (1985) (quoting <em>United States v. Frady, </em>456 U.S. 152, 163 n. 14, 102 S.Ct. 1584, 1592 n. 14, 71 L.Ed.2d 816 (1982)).</p>\n<p id=\"b1559-10\">We fully agree with appellant that the prosecutor\u2019s remark that Sawyer had confessed to the crimes charged and that there would be testimony to this effect, when none was in fact introduced, was highly improper. Our predecessor court has consistently condemned the practice whereby a prosecutor refers in his opening to a confession which may not be introduced. <em>See United States v. Stone, </em>472 F.2d 909, 914 (5th Cir.1973) (such conduct on part of prosecutor was a \u201cbreach of propriety\u201d), <em>cert. denied, </em>449 U.S. 1020, 101 S.Ct. 586, 66 L.Ed.2d 482 (1980); <em>United States v. Killian, </em>524 F.2d 1268, 1275 (5th Cir.1975) (prosecutor\u2019s remark referred to as \u201cimproper conduct\u201d), <em>cert. denied, </em>425 U.S. 935, 96 S.Ct. 1667, 48 L.Ed.2d 177 (1976). Nevertheless, within the context of the record before us, the prosecutor\u2019s remark did not amount to plain error requiring reversal. As <em>Young </em>makes clear, improper prosecutorial remarks standing alone would not justify the reversal of a conviction unless they undermined \u201cthe fairness of the trial and contributed to a miscarriage of justice.\u201d 105 S.Ct. at 1047 n. 14. We find that the remarks did not do so for two reasons. First, immediately before the opening statement, and at least six times during trial, the court instructed the jury that statements made by government or defense counsel were not evidence in the case. We believe these repeated cautionary instructions cured any prejudice resulting from the remark. <em>See United States v. Cole, </em>755 F.2d 748, 769 (11th Cir.1985); <em>United States v. Nickerson, </em>669 F.2d 1016, 1020 (5th Cir. Unit B 1982). Second, and more importantly, is the overwhelming independent evidence of Sawyer\u2019s guilt. This evidence \u201celiminates any lingering doubt that the prosecutor\u2019s remarks unfairly prejudiced the jury\u2019s deliberations.\u201d <em>Young, </em>105 S.Ct. at 1049.</p>\n<p id=\"b1560-3\"><page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"1508\">*1508</page-number>VII. MOTION TO SUPPRESS</p>\n<p id=\"b1560-4\">Appellant Bloch entered a conditional plea of guilty to two counts of the indictment, reserving the right to appeal an adverse decision on his motion to suppress evidence. Bloch contends that the court erred by denying his motion to suppress evidence seized pursuant to the execution of a search warrant at SMC. First, Bloch argues that the warrant itself lacked particularity. Second, Bloch challenges the execution of the search, and asserts that the agents involved engaged in a \u201cgeneral exploratory rummaging\u201d in violation of the Fourth Amendment. We disagree.</p>\n<p id=\"b1560-5\">1. Particularity of the Search Warrant</p>\n<p id=\"b1560-6\">As we observed in <em>United States v. Wuagneux, </em>683 F.2d 1343, 1349 (11th Cir.1982), <em>cert. denied, </em>464 U.S. 814, 104 S.Ct. 69, 78 L.Ed.2d 83 (1983), the particularity requirement of the Fourth Amendment must be applied with a practical margin of flexibility, taking into account the nature of the items to be seized and the complexity of the case under investigation. The Supreme Court has recognized that a complex criminal investigation may require piecing together \u201c[l]ike a jigsaw puzzle\u201d a number of items of evidence that may not appear incriminating when taken alone. <em>Andresen v. Maryland, </em>427 U.S. 463, 481, n. 10, 96 S.Ct. 2737, 2749, n. 10, 49 L.Ed.2d 627 (1976). Moreover, in cases involving a pervasive scheme to defraud, all the business records of the enterprise may properly be seized. <em>See e.g., United States v. Accardo, </em>749 F.2d 1477, 1479, n. 3, (11th Cir.), <em>cert. denied, </em>\u2014 U.S. -, 106 S.Ct. 314, 88 L.Ed.2d 295 (1985); <em>United States v. Brien, </em>617 F.2d 299, 308-09 (1st Cir.) (approving warrant authorizing seizure of materials that made up \u201cmost of the business records\u201d of investment firm), <em>cert. denied, </em>446 U.S. 919, 100 S.Ct. 1854, 64 L.Ed.2d 273 (1980).</p>\n<p id=\"b1560-11\">Applying these standards, we find no merit to Bloch\u2019s contention that the search warrant<footnotemark>15</footnotemark> should have been narrowed to include only the twenty-five customer transactions specifically described in the accompanying affidavits. The affidavits supporting the search warrant set forth repeated instances of misrepresentations, concealment of material facts and other fraudulent conduct in which defendants and their associates at SMC engaged. The affidavits identified a number of SMC salesmen or principals who participated in deceptive high pressure sales techniques and enumerated many unauthorized transfers of customer funds from one commodity pool to another to generate large commissions or management fees. We find these facts provided probable cause to believe SMC was a \u201cboiler room\u201d operation that was permeated with fraud and that this fraud affected <em>all </em>SMC\u2019s customers, not just the twenty-five specifically described. Fraudulent conduct in twenty-five separate instances made it probable that SMC sales personnel used identical deceptive and misleading sales techniques with other investors. <em>See Brien, </em>617 F.2d at 308 (similarity in sales techniques reported by 250 complaints showed evidence of a scheme to defraud). Similarly, the government here had no obligation to restrict the search to specific documents where the evidence, detailed fully in the accompanying affidavits, demonstrated widespread efforts to defraud customers through a varie<page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"1509\">*1509</page-number>ty of misleading disclosures and representations.</p>\n<p id=\"b1561-5\">Thus, based on the pattern of illegal conduct in evidence at SMC, we hold the search warrant described items to be seized with sufficient particularity to meet the requirements of the Fourth Amendment.</p>\n<p id=\"b1561-6\">2. Execution of the Search Warrant</p>\n<p id=\"b1561-7\">Bloch also argues that as a result of the allegedly overbroad search warrant, the FBI agents had unlimited discretion and engaged in a general exploratory search in violation of the fourth amendment. He claims that the executing agents \u201csimply seized everything existing on the premises,\u201d including entire file cabinets and boxes filled with documents.</p>\n<p id=\"b1561-8\">The magnitude of the search, however, is not sufficient to establish a constitutional violation. <em>Wuagneux, </em>683 F.2d at 1352. Instead, the search \u201cmay be as extensive as reasonably required to locate and seize items described in the warrant.\u201d <em>Id. </em>The reasonableness of the search depends upon the complexity of the crime being investigated and the difficulty involved in determining whether certain documents evidence fraud. <em>Id.</em></p>\n<p id=\"b1561-9\">Here, the record shows executing agents carefully confined the search to the scope of the warrant. Initially, the FBI case agent instructed the executing agents that personal records of individuals and other businesses may be on the premises and should not be seized. Moreover, during the search, the case agent did review items seized and determined a quantity of records reviewed were not those of SMC and left them on the premises. Also, SMC employees were allowed to segregate and remove their personal items. Finally, the documents seized consisted only of business records likely to reveal a pervasive scheme to defraud investors as specified in the warrant. Accordingly, we find the execution Qf the warrant did not violate the fourth amendment.</p>\n<p id=\"b1561-10\">VIII. BLOCH\u2019S GUILTY PLEA</p>\n<p id=\"b1561-11\">Bloch also moves to withdraw his guilty plea as involuntary pursuant to Fed.R. Crim.P. 32(d). He alleges that the trial judge induced him to enter his conditional plea of guilty by promising that his motion to suppress evidence would be heard at an evidentiary hearing, when, in fact, no hearing was ever held.</p>\n<p id=\"b1561-13\">After sentencing, a plea may be set aside only on direct appeal or by motion under 28 U.S.C. \u00a7 2255 (1982). A defendant has the burden of proving that to allow his plea to stand would result in \u201cmanifest injustice.\u201d <em>United States v. Lake, 709 </em>F.2d 43, 45 (11th Cir.1883).</p>\n<p id=\"b1561-14\">Having carefully reviewed the entire record of the guilty plea proceedings we are satisfied that Bloch entered his plea voluntarily and that he did not act under the misapprehension that his plea was contingent upon a hearing. We find the following colloquy between the trial judge and Bloch demonstrates that his plea was subject only to the condition that he would have a right to appeal a denial of his motion to suppress evidence:</p>\n<blockquote id=\"b1561-15\">THE COURT: I Have approved and the Government has consented for you to enter a conditional plea of guilty.</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b1561-16\">What that means simply is this: Your attorney has filed a motion to suppress certain evidence, and that motion will be heard by the Court.</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b1561-17\">If there should be an adverse ruling by the Court and the motion is denied \u2014 in other words, you would have received a ruling adverse to your contentions \u2014 that specific ruling may be appealed.</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b1561-18\">I am not approving anything else but that.</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b1561-19\">Do you understand that, sir?</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b1561-20\">You have a little hesitancy. Do you want me to go over it again?</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b1561-21\">THE DEFENDANT: I follow it.</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b1561-22\">THE COURT: What they are doing is, rather than closing the whole ball game and we walk out, one thing is being retained for appellate purposes \u2014 if I rule adversely to you \u2014 that is, the motion to suppress.</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b1561-23\">Do you understand that?</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b1561-24\">THE DEFENDANT: Yes.</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b1562-3\"><page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"1510\">*1510</page-number>THE COURT: But only that.</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b1562-4\">THE DEFENDANT: Yes.</blockquote>\n<p id=\"b1562-5\">Bloch never requested, nor did the court promise that an evidentiary hearing would be held or indicate it would follow any specific procedure in ruling on his motion. We, therefore, find Bloch has failed to establish the requisite \u201cmanifest injustice\u201d that would entitle him to withdraw his guilty plea.</p>\n<p id=\"b1562-6\">IX. CONCLUSION</p>\n<p id=\"b1562-7\">For the foregoing reasons, the judgment of the district court is AFFIRMED.</p>\n<footnote label=\"1\">\n<p id=\"b1549-14\">. In <em>United States v. Brien, </em>617 F.2d 299, 302 n. 5 (1st Cir.), <em>cert. denied, </em>446 U.S. 919, 100 S.Ct. 1854, 64 L.Ed.2d 273 (1980) (quoting <em>S.E.C. v. R.J. Allen &amp; Assocs., </em>386 F.Supp. 866, 874 (S.D.Fla.1974), the court offered the following description of a \u201cboiler room\u201d:</p>\n<blockquote id=\"A3Ci\">\u2018Boiler room\u2019 activity consists essentially of offering to customers securities of certain issuers in large volume by means of an intensive selling campaign through numerous salesmen by telephone or direct mail, without regard to the suitability to the needs of the customer, in such a manner as to induce a hasty decision to buy the security being offered without disclosure of the material facts about the issuer.</blockquote>\n</footnote>\n<footnote label=\"2\">\n<p id=\"b1550-6\">. The four co-defendants were, like appellant Leavitt, SMC salespeople. Philip H. Gold was tried and convicted, but has not appealed; Arthur P. Allen and William L. Zipkin were also tried but acquitted on all counts; Mary Jane Seide pleaded guilty before trial and, thereafter, testified, as did appellant Bloch, for the government. SMC itself was not named as a defendant.</p>\n</footnote>\n<footnote label=\"3\">\n<p id=\"b1550-11\">. SMC was registered with the Commodity Futures Trading Commission (CFTC) as a commodity pool operator and commodity trading advisor pursuant to the Commodity Exchange Act, 7 U.S.C. \u00a7 6n (1982).</p>\n</footnote>\n<footnote label=\"4\">\n<p id=\"b1551-5\">. A long-term futures pool traded in a single commodity. SMC which made the trading decisions, charged each participant a management fee which averaged thirty-five to forty percent of the total investment.</p>\n</footnote>\n<footnote label=\"5\">\n<p id=\"b1551-6\">. In a managed account pool SMC traded futures contracts for a variety of commodities and charged each pool participant an initial management fee of ten percent of his investment. The pool was charged a commission of $95 for each transaction by the pool. Of this amount, SMC paid the executing salesman between $18-$25 and retained the balance for itself. Each pool participant paid a pro rata share of these commissions according to his proportional interest in the pool. Thus, an investor could be charged repeated commissions although his initial investment had not changed.</p>\n</footnote>\n<footnote label=\"6\">\n<p id=\"b1551-7\">. Investors only learned of these losses when they received monthly statements. SMC put in a new computer system and monthly statements were not available on it until February 1981, when investors received statements of their positions as of December 30, 1980; statements from January 1981 were received in March 1981.</p>\n</footnote>\n<footnote label=\"7\">\n<p id=\"b1551-13\">. The history of one commodity pool, \"Managed 81\u201d (8102), illustrates this activity. The first massive transfer of customer funds into 8102 occurred in January 1981 and involved the accounts of 139 investors totalling $33,956.60. On January 29, 1981, a much larger transfer of investor funds into 8102 totalling $396,993.81 occurred, again without their knowledge or permission. On February 5, 1981, when trading began, 8102 had an equity balance of $581,-008.83. SMC collected management fees of $53,716.00 from these transfers. Although SMC salesmen told inquiring investors that 8102 was operating profitably, this pool never operated at a profit during any month of its existence. While 8102 showed some trading gains, the enormous commissions absorbed the minuscule profits and all of the equity. In February, 8102 lost over $250,000; in March, it lost $268,000. By June 30, 1981, the remaining capital in 8102 was $.03.</p>\n</footnote>\n<footnote label=\"8\">\n<p id=\"b1552-6\">. CFTC regulations require that disclosure documents provide information to a prospective participant before he sends in his money. 17 C.F.R. \u00a7 4.21 (1985). Barbara Stern, special <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"1501\">*1501</page-number>counsel to the CFTC testified that the disclosure statement is designed to protect unsophisticated investors and, therefore, must contain information the CFTC believes material to an investment decision. SMC required each investor to fill out a \"Disclosure Statement and Account Agreement Form\" which, in small print, purportedly made all disclosures required by the CFTC. SMC used the same Disclosure Statement from September 1980 through May 1982.</p>\n</footnote>\n<footnote label=\"9\">\n<p id=\"b1553-5\">.

As regards SMC\u2019s track record, by February 1981 Sawyer and Bloch had direct information from computer runs and audited financial statements about the huge losses in SMC\u2019s pools occasioned by Siegel\u2019s unsuccessful trades. <em>See supra </em>p. 1500. Sawyer and Bloch, however, were at a sales meeting in late April 1981 where SMC saleswoman Mary Jane Seide testified she questioned the Disclosure Statement\u2019s false representation that SMC had no track record. In response the SMC sales manager instructed the salespeople to lie and tell investors \"that prior to January of 1981, the pools were non-existent ...
