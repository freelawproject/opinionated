RUBIN, Circuit Judge:</author>\n<p id=\"b297-25\">A law firm and its members contend that they are insured under a legal malpractice binder covering losses resulting from claims made within the effective term of the policy, but resulting from errors and omissions committed prior to that time, provided that the insured did not know before the binder was issued of \u201cany circumstance\u201d that might result in a claim being made against the firm or any of its partners. On the basis of the evidence adduced by the firm in opposition to the insurer\u2019s motion for summary judgment, viewed in the manner most favorable to it, we affirm the summary judgment holding that members of the firm knew when the binder was issued of just such circumstances relating to a specific claim and that the insured, therefore, were not entitled to coverage as to that claim.</p>\n<p id=\"b298-3\"><page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"220\">*220</page-number>I.</p>\n<p id=\"b298-4\">The law firm of Fawer, Brian, Hardy &amp; Zatzkis, in which Michael S. Fawer and A. Morgan Brian were partners, obtained a conditional binder to issue a policy of professional liability insurance from Fremont Indemnity Company (\u201cFremont\u201d) covering claims made after October 29, 1982, for errors and omissions in rendering legal services. Although the policy was never in fact issued and the conditions of the binder may not have been fulfilled, for purposes of this appeal it is presumed that the binder remained effective until its rescission on December 1, 1982, and that it provided the same coverage over that period as the contemplated policy would have provided. The policy for which the Fawer firm applied would have provided claims-made coverage, that is it would have covered claims asserted during the policy period even for errors and omissions that had occurred \u201cprior to the effective date of the policy, provided that ... no insured had knowledge of any circumstance which might result in a claim at the effective date of the ... policy ....\u201d</p>\n<p id=\"b298-5\">Edward R. Drury, a lawyer who had been unsuccessfully defended by Fawer in a criminal case at a time prior to issuance of Fremont\u2019s policy, filed suit in state court on November 23, 1982, after the binder had been issued, asserting a malpractice claim against Fawer based on Fawer\u2019s alleged errors and omissions while representing him in that trial. Fawer\u2019s lawyer sent a copy of the complaint to Fremont, requesting that Fremont defend and insure Fawer and his law firm. Fremont responded with this suit, seeking a declaratory judgment against both the Fawer firm and Drury that the policy does not afford coverage for Drury\u2019s claim.</p>\n<p id=\"b298-6\">The issue at the heart of this appeal is whether Fawer and his firm had knowledge, at the time the binder was issued, of circumstances surrounding Fawer\u2019s representation of Drury that might result in a claim. The district court considered Fremont\u2019s motion for summary judgment on the basis of evidence brought to its attention in regard to previous motions for summary judgment. This included two memo-randa, one by Brian and the other by Fawer, for the Fawer firm\u2019s files. Brian\u2019s file memorandum, prepared on October 27, 1982 before Drury filed suit, recounted various developments in his efforts to obtain professional liability insurance for the law firm, which had been formed only a short time earlier. Discussing a telephone conference with an insurance broker, this memorandum stated:</p>\n<blockquote id=\"b298-8\">He [Berry, the insurance broker] also asked me, or Mike Fawer, to let him know further details about the case in which Mike has been told by opposing counsel Drury [sic] that, if we sue for the unpaid fee, Drury intends to counterclaim for professional negligence in the handling of the case. I gave that message to MSF [Fawer] and he said that he would telephone Berry and discuss it directly.</blockquote>\n<p id=\"b298-9\">The binder was issued two days later.</p>\n<p id=\"b298-10\">The second file memorandum, prepared by Fawer after Drury had filed suit, confirms that before Fremont issued its binder a serious dispute with Drury had erupted. Fawer\u2019s memo states that, following Dru-ry\u2019s trial and conviction, Drury\u2019s \u201cdispleasure with what had occurred mounted.\u201d After Fawer had filed an appeal from the Drury conviction and while he was working on the appellate brief, the memorandum continues, he met a number of times with Drury and Drury\u2019s law partner, Clark Richard. \u201cThroughout this period Ed [Drury] was becoming increasingly antagonistic in the sense that he was terribly frustrated by [the district judge\u2019s] ruling and was looking to blame everyone but himself for the difficulties he then found himself in.\u201d</p>\n<p id=\"b298-11\">According to the memorandum, Drury had complained of the amount of Fawer\u2019s bill when it was tendered in mid-June, 1982, and, in meetings to discuss the bill, had \u201ccomplained about a number of items such as his not being sent copies of certain pleadings prior to the trial, about our failure to file a motion for a new trial, about his failure to be notified in advance of our request for additional time within which to <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"221\">*221</page-number>file the brief,\u201d and about the lack of detail in the time records Fawer submitted with his bill.</p>\n<p id=\"b299-4\">The memorandum continues:</p>\n<blockquote id=\"b299-5\">In the course of this meeting, at which Ronda Lustman, my associate, was present, Ed stated that because of these problems he would not pay us until after the Fifth Circuit had rendered its decision and would, at that time decide how much he would remit. At this time he also suggested that he wanted Clark Richard, his partner and an individual who had absolutely no experience in the trial or appeal of criminal cases, to argue the matter. The discussion ended in a very acrimonious way and it was clear to me that we were going to have substantial difficulty collecting our fee....</blockquote>\n<p id=\"b299-6\">Upon Drury\u2019s instructions, Fawer withdrew from the case, and the appeal was taken over by Richard. Ultimately, Dru-ry\u2019s conviction was affirmed.</p>\n<p id=\"b299-7\">Relying upon the information contained in these memoranda, the district court concluded that the Fawer firm knew that the facts of the Drury case presented \u201ca \u2018ticking bomb\u2019 situation\u201d and, accordingly, granted summary judgment in Fremont\u2019s favor. Fawer and the Fawer firm immediately moved for rehearing, contending that they had not been given ample opportunity to present evidence clarifying what was written in their file memoranda. The district court agreed to consider new evidence, and the firm submitted additional affidavits.</p>\n<p id=\"b299-8\">An affidavit submitted by Brian explains the statements contained in his October 27 memorandum. In that affidavit, he asserts that he</p>\n<blockquote id=\"b299-9\">had no first hand knowledge of what Drury had told Fawer about his intentions if a suit for attorney\u2019s fees were filed. Any information which deponent had about this was obtained as second hand, hearsay from Fawer. At the time when the memo about insurance was written, deponent was under the impression that Drury himself had threatened to counter-sue Fawer if a claim for fees was made. Deponent later learned from discussions with Fawer that his impression was due to a misunderstanding as to what Fawer told deponent. Fawer never reported any direct threat by Drury that he would counter-sue. Fawer had been told by another attorney who knew Drury that if Fawer sued Drury for attorney\u2019s fees, the other attorney wouldn\u2019t be surprised if Drury counter-sued. Fawer considered this to be an unfounded rumor without any substance and, therefore, this was not disclosed in the Fremont application.</blockquote>\n<p id=\"b299-11\">Fawer also filed an affidavit explaining his earlier memorandum. Fawer\u2019s affidavit states that Drury\u2019s complaints \u201cconcerned the number of hours and amount of fee I was charging only____ At no time did I have knowledge of any circumstances which might result in a claim being made against me by Mr. Drury for actions covered by Fremont\u2019s policy.\u201d</p>\n<p id=\"b299-14\">The district court, however, adhered to its conclusion that, at the time the binder was issued, the Fawer firm \u201cwas aware of problems presented by the Drury case----\u201d The court, therefore, maintained the summary judgment in Fremont\u2019s favor and issued a final judgment granting Fremont relief against the Fawer firm, but dismissing Fremont\u2019s complaint against Drury without prejudice and preserving Drury\u2019s rights against Fawer and the Fawer law firm as asserted in his state court action. Fawer and the Fawer firm appeal the summary judgment, and Fremont appeals the denial of its motion for summary judgment against Drury.</p>\n<p id=\"b299-16\">II.</p>\n<p id=\"b299-17\">Summary judgment procedure has provoked a galaxy of opinions and myriad commentaries. The purpose of the procedure has sometimes been misunderstood, perhaps in part because the motion for summary judgment has often been used improperly: as a discovery device; to educate the trial judge; in the hope, however <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"222\">*222</page-number>faint, of quick victory; and in the expectation, frequently realized of retarding the progress of a suit and making litigation more expensive. Trial court reluctance to grant summary judgment has been increased by frequent appellate reversals.</p>\n<p id=\"b300-4\">Professor Moore in his Treatise on Federal Practice aptly states, \u201cIn its broadest scope the summary judgment procedure is in the nature of a pre-trial inquiry, brought on by motion of either a claimant or a defending party for a favorable determination that a trial is unnecessary because there is no genuine issue as to any material fact.\u201d<footnotemark>1</footnotemark> As Judge William W. Schwarzer has pointed out, \u201cSummary adjudication of claims or defenses is one of the means for implementing the fundamental policy of the Federal Rules stated in Rule 1: \u2018to secure the just, speedy and inexpensive determination of every action.\u2019 \u201d<footnotemark>2</footnotemark> It complements Rule 11, which requires good faith investigation and good faith pleading;<footnotemark>3</footnotemark> and Rule 12, permitting dismissals for failure to state a claim for which relief can be granted. By permitting partial summary judgment, it facilitates the definition of issues for trial. Thus, \u201cThe primary function of summary judgment,\u201d as Professor Martin B. Louis has commented, \u201cis to intercept factually deficient claims and defenses in advance of trial.\u201d<footnotemark>4</footnotemark></p>\n<p id=\"b300-13\">Although Rule 56 is peculiarly adapted to the disposition of legal questions, it is not limited to that role. The rule states that judgment \u201cshall be rendered ... if the pleadings, depositions, answers to interrogatories, and admissions on file, together with the affidavits, if any, show that there is no genuine issue as to any material fact and that the moving party is entitled to a judgment as a matter of law.\u201d The mere existence of a disputed factual issue, therefore, does not foreclose summary judgment. The dispute must be genuine, and the facts must be material.</p>\n<p id=\"b300-14\">An issue is genuine if the evidence supporting its resolution in favor of the party opposing summary judgment, together with any inferences in such party\u2019s favor that the evidence allows,<footnotemark>5</footnotemark> would be sufficient to support a verdict in favor of that party. If, on the other hand, the evidence offered by both the moving and opposing parties would support only one conclusion and, even if all the evidence to the contrary is fully credited, a trial court would be obliged to direct a verdict in favor of the moving party, the issue is not genuine.<footnotemark>6</footnotemark> Trial of such an issue would be wasted effort.<footnotemark>7</footnotemark> Thus employed to decide cases in which there is no genuine issue, Rule 56 is a means of disposing of meretricious disputes <footnotemark>8</footnotemark> and serves the \u201cvery mission\u201d attributed to it by the Advisory Committee: <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"223\">*223</page-number>\u201cto pierce the pleadings and to assess the proof to see whether there is a genuine issue for trial.\u201d<footnotemark>9</footnotemark></p>\n<p id=\"b301-4\">Thus, as the Supreme Court recently said in <em>Anderson v. Liberty Lobby, Inc., </em>affirming a summary judgment rendered by a trial court: \u201cThe inquiry performed is the threshold inquiry of determining whether there is a need for trial \u2014 whether, in other words, there are any genuine factual issues that can be resolved only by a finder of fact because they may reasonably be resolved in favor of either party.\u201d<footnotemark>10</footnotemark></p>\n<p id=\"b301-5\">The standard, the Court said, \u201cmirrors the standard for directed verdict under Federal Rule of Civil Procedure 50(a), which is that the trial judge must direct a verdict if, under the governing law, there can be but one reasonable conclusion as to the verdict.\u201d<footnotemark>11</footnotemark> The question, therefore, is whether there is a triable issue, not whether some scintilla of evidence might be interposed.<footnotemark>12</footnotemark> In <em>Celotex Corporation v. Catrett,</em><footnotemark><em>13</em></footnotemark><em> </em>another case decided last term, the Court repeated, \u201c \u2018[t]h[e] standard [for granting summary judgment] mirrors the standard for a directed verdict under Federal Rule of Civil Procedure 50(a),\u2019 \u201d and, in the same fashion, in nonjury cases it mirrors the standards for dismissals provided by Rule 41(b).</p>\n<p id=\"b301-6\">This court has enunciated the same standard: a party is entitled to defeat summary judgment and \u201cgo to the jury only if\u201d there is evidence reasonably affording an inference that would sustain its position.<footnotemark>14</footnotemark> This directed verdict/judgment n.o.v. analysis necessarily accounts for the effect of rules allocating the burden of proof on the issues.<footnotemark>15</footnotemark></p>\n<p id=\"b301-17\">The Fawer firm contends that it might win a jury verdict. That, of course, is true. The question for the district court was not, however, whether advocacy would prevail despite insufficient evidence, but whether the case should even be submitted to a jury or whether, if it were, a finding in the firm\u2019s favor could withstand a motion to set the verdict aside.</p>\n<p id=\"b301-18\">III.</p>\n<p id=\"b301-19\">Reviewing the evidence presented to the trial court, we agree that no genuine issue exists about whether members of the Fawer firm knew that the circumstances surrounding Fawer\u2019s representation of Drury might result in a claim against the insured. At the time the Fremont binder was issued, Brian thought (and therefore had \u201cknowledge\u201d) that, if Fawer sued Drury for his fee, Drury intended to \u201ccounterclaim\u201d for negligence, even though Brian learned sometime later that he had misinterpreted what Fawer had told him. Fawer also knew that Drury was \u201cantagonistic\u201d and \u201cwas looking to blame everyone but himself for the difficulty he then found himself in.\u201d Fawer\u2019s own memo states that Drury was so dissatisfied with Fawer\u2019s services that he replaced Fawer \u2014 an experienced and, indeed, renowned defense lawyer \u2014 as counsel on appeal with \u201cClark Richard, [Drury\u2019s] partner and an individu<page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"224\">*224</page-number>al who had absolutely no experience in the trial or appeal of criminal cases____\u201d</p>\n<p id=\"b302-5\">This, then, was not merely a difference about a fee. There was beyond genuine dispute a \u201ccircumstance that might result in a claim\u201d being made. Nor can it be said that Brian and Fawer may not have understood the significance of the facts that they knew. Brian had been admitted to the bar for twenty-eight years, had previously been a senior partner in two law firms, and was rated \u201ca-v\u201d in Martindale-Hubbell Law Directory. Fawer had been admitted to the bar for twenty-four years, had been a trial attorney in the Department of Justice and an Assistant U.S. Attorney for the Southern District of New York, had practiced in Louisiana for more than eighteen years actively engaging in the trial of civil and criminal cases, and was rated \u201ca-v\u201d in Mar-tindale-Hubbell. They were, then, both experienced and well regarded by the bar. They were also in a position to appreciate the difference between a client who simply asserts he has been overcharged and wishes a reduction in the fee and one who is so disgruntled that he may assert a claim for improper representation. If the facts known to Fawer and Brian were only that Drury was angry about the quality of his representation and might counter-claim if sued for a fee, this was knowledge of the circumstance that eventually did result in a claim being made. It was not necessary to defeat coverage that suit have been filed or that a claim have been made.</p>\n<p id=\"b302-6\">IV.</p>\n<p id=\"b302-7\">The Fawer firm asserts that the knowledge provision incorporated by Fremont into its policy is ambiguous and, therefore, must be written out of the policy or, at least, be construed in the light most favorable to the insured. The trial judge did not find the provision ambiguous, nor do we. Determination of what constitutes knowledge is a question of fact that might be resolved differently by different triers of fact, but that circumstance does not make the contractual provision itself ambiguous. Moreover, as we have pointed out, some information may be so clearly sufficient to instill knowledge in a party that a verdict to the contrary could not stand.</p>\n<p id=\"b302-10\">Unambiguous provisions of an insurance contract subject to Louisiana law must be enforced unless they conflict with statute- or public policy,<footnotemark>16</footnotemark> and Louisiana courts have enforced policies issued with \u201cclaims made\u201d coverage.<footnotemark>17</footnotemark></p>\n<p id=\"b302-11\">The Fawer firm also contends that the questioned provision in the policy is best characterized as an insurer\u2019s demand for a \u201cwarranty\u201d or \u201crepresentation\u201d by the insured that no circumstances indicating imminence of a claim are known to the insured at the time that he applies for the policy. Because a Louisiana statute<footnotemark>18</footnotemark> makes warranties or representations by the insured a ground for voiding a policy only if made with \u201cintent to deceive,\u201d the firm argues that summary judgment is not proper when, as here, no intent to deceive has been shown.</p>\n<p id=\"b302-12\">To support their characterization of the provision as a \u201cwarranty\u201d or \u201crepresentation,\u201d the Fawer firm emphasizes both that questions concerning knowledge of past and impending claims were included on the insurance application and that the application \u2014 as well as the contemplated policy \u2014 expressly state that coverage is granted in reliance upon those representations. Although the information on the application may have served as a warranty or representation supplying Fremont with a basis for evaluating the risk associated with insuring the Fawer firm, the specific policy provision in question is patently a <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"225\">*225</page-number>limitation on coverage. Fremont does not rely on any alleged false statements in the application for insurance or in any declarations made a part of the policy.<footnotemark>19</footnotemark> For purposes of this appeal, the claim Fremont raises is not that the policy is entirely void due to false representations, but only that Drury\u2019s claim would not be covered even if the policy remains enforceable. Therefore, here, as in <em>Compass Insurance Companies v. Vanguard Insurance </em>Company<footnotemark>20</footnotemark> we look only to the terms of the policy because the issue before us relates only to the scope of the insurance it affords.<footnotemark>21</footnotemark></p>\n<p id=\"b303-5\">V.</p>\n<p id=\"b303-6\">Since the policy did not cover the asserted liability of Fawer or the Fawer firm to Drury, it could not cover Drury\u2019s potential claim against Fremont under the Louisiana Direct Action statute,<footnotemark>22</footnotemark> regardless of the outcome of Drury\u2019s state court suit.<footnotemark>23</footnotemark> Therefore, the judgment is amended to declare that Fremont is not liable to Drury, without prejudice to any claim Drury may have against Fawer.</p>\n<p id=\"b303-7\">For these reasons the judgment in favor of Fremont against Fawer and the firm of Fawer, Brian, Hardy &amp; Zatzkis is AFFIRMED. The judgment is amended, however, to include judgment in favor of Fremont and against Drury.</p>\n<footnote label=\"1\">\n<p id=\"b300-5\">. 6 Moore\u2019s Federal Practice 56.15[8], 56-638; <em>Bruce v.
