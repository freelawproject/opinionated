Adams appeals the district court\u2019s order dismissing her complaint for lack of jurisdiction. Because we find that the Appeals Council\u2019s decision to dismiss Adams\u2019 appeal for untimeliness is not a \u201cfinal decision of the Secretary,\u201d we affirm the district court\u2019s holding that the court lacks jurisdiction to review the merits of Adams\u2019 disability claim. We also agree with the court below that the Appeals Council\u2019s refusal to find \u201cgood cause\u201d to extend the filing deadline should not be disturbed. Accordingly, the district court is affirmed.</p>\n<p id=\"b210-18\">I.</p>\n<p id=\"b210-19\">Adams began receiving Social Security disability benefits in November 1975. Thereafter, the Social Security Administration reviewed her claim and determined that her benefits should have ceased as of October 1981. She requested and received a hearing before an Administrative Law Judge (AU). The ALJ issued a decision that was partly favorable to Adams: she should have received benefits until March 1982, but not thereafter.</p>\n<p id=\"b210-20\">Adams received this decision with accompanying notice, entitled \u201cNotice of Favorable Decision Please Read Carefully.\u201d The first sentence of the notice stated: \u201cThe enclosed decision is favorable to you, either wholly or partly.\u201d Jt.App. at 7. The notice also stated that the claimant had sixty days to request Appeals Council review.</p>\n<p id=\"b210-21\">Adams contacted her attorney on several occasions during the sixty-day period, concerned that the decision was not \u201cfavorable.\u201d The attorney assured her each time that the decision was favorable, that she would continue to receive benefits, and thus there was no need to appeal. Thereafter, Adams stopped receiving disability benefits.</p>\n<p id=\"b210-22\">She secured a new attorney, who immediately filed for review by the Appeals Council, after realizing that the AU\u2019s decision was only partly favorable. The filing, however, was some eighty days after the AU\u2019s decision was rendered, and thus twenty days after the filing deadline for review by the Appeals Council. The new attorney requested that the Appeals Council extend <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"133\">*133</page-number>the filing deadline. He reasoned that the notice, entitled \u201cNotice of Favorable Decision,\u201d was misleading and thus constituted good cause to excuse the late filing. The Appeals Council rejected the extension request, finding no good cause, and dismissed Adams\u2019 request for review on the ground that it was not timely filed.</p>\n<p id=\"b211-4\">Adams appealed to the district court. The Ser retary moved to dismiss, contending that Adams failed to properly exhaust her administrative remedies with respect to her claim for benefits, and therefore there had been no \u201cfinal decision of the Secretary\u201d as required by \u00a7 205(g) of the Social Security Act, 42 U.S.C. \u00a7 405(g). The Secretary argued that the court was therefore without jurisdiction to review either the merits of Adams\u2019 disability claim or the Appeals Council\u2019s refusal of Adams\u2019 request for an extension of time to request review. Adams contended that the court had jurisdiction and that the Appeals Council\u2019s decision should be remanded since it did not consider the argument that the failure to file a timely appeal was attributable to misadvice of counsel.</p>\n<p id=\"b211-5\">The district court, adopting the Magistrate\u2019s Findings and Recommendations, dismissed Adams\u2019 complaint for lack of subject matter jurisdiction to address the merits of the disability claims. The court refused to remand or reverse the Appeals Council\u2019s good cause determination, finding that it was supported by fact and law. This appeal followed, with both parties raising the same arguments as were asserted to the district court.</p>\n<p id=\"b211-6\">II.</p>\n<p id=\"b211-7\">The first issue we must address is whether the Appeals Council\u2019s refusal to consider Adams\u2019 untimely request for review constitutes a final decision by the Secretary on the merits of her disability claim. Only final decisions may receive judicial review. <em>See </em>42 U.S.C. \u00a7 405(g) and (h).</p>\n<p id=\"b211-8\">This court, addressing a similar issue in <em>Shope v. Schweiker, </em>705 F.2d 445 (4th Cir.1983), held that refusal to review for failure to file a timely request did not constitute a final decision by the Secretary. Other circuits have explicitly held that under circumstances akin to those of the instant case, no final decision has been rendered. <em>See Smith v. Heckler, </em>761 F.2d 516 (8th Cir.1985); <em>Dietsch v. Schweiker, </em>700 F.2d 865 (2d Cir.1983); <em>Watters v. Harris, </em>656 F.2d 234 (7th Cir.1980). Only one circuit has rejected the majority trend. <em>See Bloodsworth v. Heckler, </em>703 F.2d 1233 (11th Cir.1983).</p>\n<p id=\"b211-11\">We reject the reasoning of <em>Bloodsworth, </em>and find the majority view more compelling. The Eighth Circuit expressed sound justification for finding no final decision in the dismissal of an appeal for failure to timely file:</p>\n<blockquote id=\"b211-12\">The Appeals Council may dismiss a request for review if it is not filed within the stated time. 20 C.F.R. \u00a7 404.971 (1984). Such dismissal is binding and not subject to further review. <em>Id. </em>404.972. Such action does not address the merits of the claim, and thus cannot be considered appealable, as can the Appeals Council\u2019s decisions and denials of <em>timely </em>requests for review. <em>See id. </em>\u00a7 404.981. As we stated in <em>Sheehan, </em>\u201cIf the claimant may obtain review in this situation [late filing of an appeal] the Secretary\u2019s orderly procedures for processing disability claims mean little or nothing. If claimant may avoid the timely exhaustion of remedies requirement, any claimant could belatedly appeal his claim at any time and always obtain district court review of an AU\u2019s decision.\u201d</blockquote>\n<p id=\"b211-13\"><em>Smith v. Heckler, </em>761 F.2d at 518 (quoting <em>Sheehan v. Secretary, </em>593 F.2d 323, 326-27 (8th Cir.1979)). We therefore affirm the district court\u2019s conclusion that no final decision by the Secretary has been presented by the facts herein and thus no jurisdiction for judicial review of the merits of Adams\u2019 disability claim exists.</p>\n<p id=\"b211-14\">The second issue on appeal is whether we can and should remand this action to the Appeals Council for further consideration of Adams\u2019 request to extend <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"134\">*134</page-number>the filing deadline.<footnotemark>1</footnotemark> Assuming without deciding that we have jurisdiction to review the Appeals Council\u2019s decision to dismiss and refusal to find good cause, we find no grounds to reverse or remand.</p>\n<p id=\"b212-4\">Adams\u2019 primary contention is that the action should be remanded so that she may argue to the Appeals Council that her first attorney\u2019s erroneous advice constituted good cause for extending the deadline. She failed to raise this contention when she originally sought an extension for good cause. Her sole argument then was that the notice, entitled \u201cNotice of Favorable Decision,\u201d was misleading.</p>\n<p id=\"b212-5\">We must reject Adams\u2019 request. She should have raised the attorney error argument when she originally requested an extension. She and her new attorney were aware at that time that her predicament was partly due to her first attorney\u2019s misadvice. Accordingly, it is her fault that the Appeals Council was not originally asked to consider whether attorney error is \u201cgood cause\u201d for excusing a late filing. Adams had her opportunity to be heard; errors in that hearing from her own negligence is not ground for a remand or reversal. An individual is entitled to her day in court, but no more. <em>Cf. Hooper v. United States, </em>326 F.2d 982, 985, 164 Ct.Cl. 151, <em>cert. denied, </em>377 U.S. 977, 84 S.Ct. 1882, 12 L.Ed.2d 746 (1964).</p>\n<p id=\"b212-6\">Finally, we find no error in the Appeals Council\u2019s determination that the allegedly misleading notice did not constitute good cause. The notice accompanying the AU\u2019s decision, although entitled \u201cNotice of Favorable Decision,\u201d clearly stated that the decision was favorable either wholly or partly. Moreover, it stated \u201cPlease Read Carefully.\u201d Thus, the title, \u201cNotice of Favorable Decision,\u201d was sufficiently qualified to give warning that the text of the decision should be read and relied upon, not the title.</p>\n<p id=\"b212-9\">For the reasons stated above, we affirm the decision below to dismiss Adams\u2019 complaint.</p>\n<p id=\"b212-10\">AFFIRMED.</p>\n<footnote label=\"1\">\n<p id=\"b212-7\">. The Secretary argues that we lack jurisdiction to review the Appeals Council\u2019s decision. We need not address this argument because of our conclusion on the merits.</p>\n</footnote>\n</opinion>\n</casebody>\n",
