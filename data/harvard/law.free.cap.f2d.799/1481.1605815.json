Because we conclude that Code received ineffective assistance of counsel as defined in <em>Strickland v. Washington, </em>466 U.S. 668, 104 <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"1482\">*1482</page-number>S.Ct. 2052, 80 L.Ed.2d 674 (1984), we reverse and remand.</p>\n<p id=\"b1534-4\">I. BACKGROUND</p>\n<p id=\"b1534-5\">In 1976, Code was convicted in state court of an armed robbery that had occurred two and a half years earlier at a residence near Bainbridge, Georgia.<footnotemark>1</footnotemark> While incarcerated in Macon on an unrelated charge, Code received three weeks\u2019 notice of his impending trial in Bainbridge for the armed robbery offense. He was transferred to Bainbridge one week before the trial. Code steadfastly maintained that he had never before set foot in the Bain-bridge area. On Friday, December 10, 1976, three days prior to trial, Code first met George Stacy, his court appointed counsel.<footnotemark>2</footnotemark> Stacy\u2019s trial preparation primarily consisted of calling Code\u2019s mother and suggesting that she attend the upcoming trial. On Monday, December 13, 1976, Code was tried despite his protests that his attorney was unprepared. When no witnesses, other than the defendant, appeared on Code\u2019s behalf, his attorney failed to move for a continuance. Although Code\u2019s sole defense was an alibi, at trial Stacy never asked Code where he was on the day of the robbery.</p>\n<p id=\"b1534-10\">Code\u2019s first state habeas petition was dismissed because he had escaped custody. It was refiled and relief was denied. He filed a federal habeas corpus petition which the district court denied. This court, however, remanded for an evidentiary hearing on Code\u2019s ineffective assistance of counsel claim. <em>Code v. Montgomery, </em>725 F.2d 1316 (11th Cir.1984).<footnotemark>3</footnotemark></p>\n<p id=\"b1534-11\">In his evidentiary hearing in the federal district court, Code presented alibi testimony placing him in Macon throughout the day of the crime. The district court specifically rejected Code\u2019s assertions that he told Stacy that he had been at an April Fool\u2019s Day party at the Central Hotel in Macon on the day of the robbery and that Estella Taylor, a co-worker, would so testify.<footnotemark>4</footnotemark> Accordingly, the district court denied Code\u2019s ineffective assistance claim.</p>\n<p id=\"b1534-12\">II. ANALYSIS</p>\n<p id=\"b1534-13\">In this appeal, Code continues to assert that he was denied a fair trial due to the ineffective assistance of counsel rendered by Stacy. To prevail on an ineffective assistance of counsel claim, a habeas corpus petitioner must show that (1) his <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"1483\">*1483</page-number>attorney\u2019s performance was deficient and (2) that the deficient performance prejudiced the defense. <em>Strickland, </em>104 S.Ct. at 2064. Accordingly, we first inquire as to \u201cthe reasonableness of counsel\u2019s challenged conduct on the facts of the particular case, viewed as of the time of counsel\u2019s conduct.\u201d 104 S.Ct. at 2066. If counsel erred, we next inquire whether \u201cthere is a reasonable probability that, but for counsel\u2019s unprofessional errors, the result of the proceeding would have been different.\u201d 104 S.Ct. at 2068. A petitioner need not show that but for counsel\u2019s errors, the outcome of the proceeding would more likely than not have been different: \u201c[A] reasonable probability is a probability sufficient to undermine confidence in the outcome.\u201d <em>Id., see also Nix v. Whiteside, </em>\u2014 U.S. \u2014, 106 S.Ct. 988, 999, 89 L.Ed.2d 123 (1986). The \u201c \u2018benchmark\u2019 of an ineffective assistance claim is the fairness of the adversary proceeding.\u201d <em>Nix, </em>106 S.Ct. at 999.</p>\n<p id=\"b1535-4\">Code alleges two specific instances of ineffective assistance: inadequate pretrial investigation and failure to request a continuance.</p>\n<p id=\"b1535-5\">A. <em>Pretrial Investigation</em></p>\n<p id=\"aog-dedup-1\">1. Attorney Performance</p>\n<p id=\"acb-dedup-0\">Undisputed facts establish that Code\u2019s counsel\u2019s performance fell below established competency standards. Attorney Stacy interviewed one defense witness: he telephoned Code\u2019s mother. He attempted to phone Code\u2019s girl friend, Mary Jackson, and testified that he \u201cmight have\u201d interviewed one of the five prosecution witnesses. Although he knew that Code\u2019s exclusive defense was based on an alibi, Stacy never asked Code\u2019s mother where Code was on April 1, 1974, the day of the robbery. Had he asked, he would have learned that although Code\u2019s mother had no personal knowledge of Code\u2019s whereabouts on April 1, she could have provided him with leads regarding alibi witnesses.<footnotemark>5</footnotemark> Moreover, during the phone conversation, Code\u2019s mother indicated she could not attend Code\u2019s trial that coming Monday. Stacy made no attempt to subpoena her even though she was the only potential defense witness with whom he spoke and he erroneously believed she could provide Code\u2019s alibi. Instead, he suggested to Code, who was incarcerated, that Code secure his mother\u2019s presence at trial.</p>\n<p id=\"b1535-8\">In his deposition in the district court, Stacy testified that he didn\u2019t think it necessary to go to Macon to locate Code\u2019s girl friend or other alibi witnesses or to ensure Mrs. Code\u2019s presence at trial: \u201cI just don\u2019t think I\u2019m required as a practicing attorney to be a taxi boy.\u201d Stacy also testified that due to a personality clash, he had to \u201cswallow his pride\u201d in order to represent Code.</p>\n<p id=\"b1535-9\">The adequacy of a pretrial investigation turns on the complexity of the case and trial strategy. <em>Washington v. Strickland, </em>693 F.2d 1243, 1251 (11th Cir.1982) (en banc), <em>rev\u2019d on other grounds, </em>466 U.S. 688, 104 S.Ct. 2052, 80 L.Ed.2d 674 (1984). Here there was only one strategy: an alibi defense. By not inquiring as to Code\u2019s whereabouts on the day of the robbery, Stacy\u2019s investigation was inadequate. <em>See Nealy v. Cabana, </em>764 F.2d 1173 (5th Cir.1985); <em>Gomez v. Beto, </em>462 F.2d 596, 597 (5th Cir.1972) (failure to investigate sole defense; failure to subpoena requested alibi witnesses established ineffectiveness); <em>cf. Aldrich v. Wainwright, 777 </em>F.2d 630, 637 (11th Cir.1985) (failure to conduct meaningful pretrial investigation satisfies first prong of <em>Strickland </em>test).</p>\n<p id=\"b1535-10\">Under these circumstances we conclude that a competent attorney relying on an alibi defense would have asked Code\u2019s mother if she could corroborate the alibi; would have subpoenaed a reluctant witness whom he thought could provide an alibi and would have asked either the witness or the defendant if there were other alibi witnesses.<footnotemark>6</footnotemark> Moreover, a reasonably effective at<page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"1484\">*1484</page-number>torney would have broadened his investigation once Mrs. Code indicated she was unavailable to testify. Even if Mrs. Code had appeared, Stacy had not investigated to the point where he would have discovered that she was not an alibi witness. <em>See United States v. Moore, </em>554 F.2d 1086, 1093 (D.C.Cir.1976) (\u201ccounsel\u2019s anticipation of what a potential witness would say does not excuse the failure to find out\u201d). <em>Strickland </em>embraced this court's prior ineffective assistance analysis to the extent that:</p>\n<blockquote id=\"AMNF\">strategic choices made after thorough investigation of law and facts relevant to plausible options are virtually unchallengeable; and strategic choices made after less than complete investigation are reasonable precisely to the extent that reasonable professional judgments support the limitations on investigation.</blockquote>\n<p id=\"b1536-4\">104 S.Ct. at 2066. Here, Stacy did not contact both of the alibi leads Code had provided him. Stacy\u2019s limitation on his pretrial investigation is wholly unsupported by reasonable professional judgment: although his sole strategy was to present an alibi defense, he terminated his investigation without determining whether the one witness he contacted could provide an alibi. In short, Stacy attempted to present an alibi defense with no alibi witnesses.</p>\n<p id=\"b1536-6\">2. Prejudice</p>\n<p id=\"b1536-7\">As in <em>Nealy, </em>where prejudice was established, Code\u2019s trial was a mere swearing match. In <em>Nealy, </em>the defendant claimed an alibi, although the prosecution\u2019s witness claimed he and the defendant acted as accomplices. As in <em>Nealy, </em>Code argues that the testimony of an alibi witness \u201cmight have affected\u201d the jury\u2019s comparison of the alleged accomplice\u2019s testimony with the defendant\u2019s. <em>Nealy, </em>764 F.2d at 1174. The state distinguishes <em>Nealy </em>arguing that because two victims identified Code, the jury did not have to rely solely on a credibility choice between Code and his alleged accomplice. Accordingly, unlike <em>Nealy, </em>it is less certain that alibi witnesses might have swayed the jury. Nonetheless, Code\u2019s defense was sufficiently prejudiced by Stacy\u2019s ineffectiveness to the extent that our \u201cconfidence in the [trial] outcome\u201d is undermined. <em>Strickland, </em>104 S.Ct. at 2068.</p>\n<p id=\"b1536-11\">Code was tried in December, 1976 for a robbery that occurred in April 1974. The state\u2019s case primarily entailed the testimony of the three victims and an alleged accomplice. Although they had only seen the robber during the course of a robbery that occurred two and a half years earlier, two of the victims identified Code.<footnotemark>7</footnotemark> We do not determine whether, despite the eyewitness testimony, alibi testimony <em>would </em>have resulted in Code\u2019s acquittal. <em>See Strickland, </em>104 S.Ct. at 2068 (rejecting outcome determinative test for evaluating ineffective assistance claims). We conclude that, in this case, Stacy\u2019s failure to adequately investigate and present Code\u2019s alibi defense deprived Code of a fundamentally fair trial. <em>See id. </em>at 2071. The state correctly points out that Code\u2019s case is distinguishable from <em>Nealy </em>in that here the jury could have rejected the alleged accomplice\u2019s testimony and still have convicted. Code\u2019s case and <em>Nealy </em>are identical, however, in a more important regard: in both cases appointed counsel\u2019s shortcomings effectively deprived defendants of any defense whatsoever. Failure to conduct a pretrial investigation and interview witnesses is not a per se sixth amendment violation. <em>See Aldrich, 777 </em>F.2d at 636. We cannot confidently say, however, that the case against Code <em>could </em>have withstood the introduction of the alibi testimony readily discoverable at the time of trial and subsequently proffered in habeas corpus proceedings.</p>\n<p id=\"b1537-3\"><page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"1485\">*1485</page-number>B. <em>The Continuance</em></p>\n<p id=\"b1537-4\">Code argues that Stacy\u2019s failure to move for a continuance when no defense witnesses other than himself appeared for trial is an alternative, independent instance of ineffective assistance. Had Stacy conducted a pretrial investigation and concluded that there were no credible alibi witnesses, Stacy would not be ineffective for failing to move for a continuance. <em>See Jones v. Smith, </em>772 F.2d 668, 673-74 (11th Cir.1985) (failure to request continuance not ineffective where there was no showing that alibi witnesses existed), <em>cert. denied, </em>\u2014 U.S. \u2014, 106 S.Ct. 838, 88 L.Ed.2d 809 (1986); <em>Gravenmeir v. United States, </em>399 F.2d 677 (9th Cir.1968) (same). Here, however, Code has shown that at least one alibi witness, Estella Taylor, did exist and would have testified. Because Code relied entirely on an alibi defense, competent counsel would have moved for a continuance when <em>no </em>alibi witnesses other than the defendant appeared on the day of the trial.<footnotemark>8</footnotemark></p>\n<p id=\"b1537-5\">Code was transported to Bainbridge on December 4, 1976 and tried exactly one week later. He first met with his attorney on the Friday preceding his Monday trial. It is debatable whether counsel could have adequately prepared Code\u2019s alibi defense over a weekend. It is not debatable, however, that an attorney who has neither adequately interviewed nor subpoenaed <em>any </em>witnesses further compounds error by failing to move for a continuance. We conclude, therefore, that the failure to move for a continuance was both professionally deficient and prejudicial, and further abridged Code\u2019s sixth amendment rights.</p>\n<p id=\"b1537-6\">III. CONCLUSION</p>\n<p id=\"b1537-7\">We express no opinion as to Code\u2019s guilt or innocence. We grant relief because we cannot say that Code has had a fair trial: he had a substantial alibi defense and but for his attorney\u2019s deficient performance, he would have presented it.</p>\n<p id=\"acv-dedup-0\">In light of the above we REVERSE and REMAND with instructions to grant the writ of habeas corpus.</p>\n<footnote label=\"1\">\n<p id=\"b1534-6\">. Code consistently has maintained that, at the time of the robbery, he was in Macon \u2014 a two and a half hour drive away.</p>\n</footnote>\n<footnote label=\"2\">\n<p id=\"b1534-7\">. In a deposition filed in state habeas proceedings, Stacy twice states that \u201c[m)y records disclose that I was appointed on this case and talked to the defendant on April 1, 1976.\u201d It is difficult to imagine that Stacy was appointed to represent Code several months before Code\u2019s arraignment in Bainbridge or arrest in Macon. In his deposition in federal court, Stacy, relying on his records, testified that he was appointed on either Monday, December 6th; Tuesday, December 7th; or Wednesday, December 8th and met with Code sometime later when he interviewed \"four or five\u201d other incarcerated indigents whom he had been appointed to represent. We have previously noted that Stacy \u201cdid nothing with respect to [Code\u2019s] case until his December 10, 1976, meeting with [Code].\u201d <em>Code v. Montgomery, </em>725 F.2d 1316, 1317 n. 1 (11th Cir.1984).</p>\n</footnote>\n<footnote label=\"3\">\n<p id=\"b1534-8\">. Pursuant to several concerns raised by this court, the district court determined:</p>\n<blockquote id=\"b1534-9\">(1) Although Code claimed otherwise, he had not informed Stacy that he worked at the Central Hotel in Macon and was working there on the day of the robbery;</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"AIHz\">(2) Although Code claimed otherwise, he had not provided Stacy the names of any Central Hotel employees who might serve as witnesses and;</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"aun-dedup-1\">(3) Although Code may have moved for a continuance between his December 6 arraignment and December 13 trial, he did not do so through counsel and counsel did not request a continuance because he thought such a request futile.</blockquote>\n</footnote>\n<footnote label=\"4\">\n<p id=\"b1534-17\">. We agree with the explanation advanced by Code\u2019s counsel at oral argument: it is not unusual for a person asked to recall who he was with during a six hour period two and a half years earlier to respond with general leads and not specific names.</p>\n<p id=\"b1534-18\">The district court noted that Code\u2019s assertion that he worked at the Central Hotel was inconsistent with his trial testimony that he had been a cement worker since he was 15. Code points out that his state habeas transcript indicates that he worked as a cement worker after the Central Hotel closed.</p>\n</footnote>\n<footnote label=\"5\">\n<p id=\"b1535-6\">. Mrs. Code\u2019s undisputed testimony in the district court indicates that she contacted Estella Taylor shortly after Stacy\u2019s call. Had Mrs. Code known the date of the robbery, she might have mentioned it to Taylor who testified that she was with Code in Macon at the time of the robbery.</p>\n</footnote>\n<footnote label=\"6\">\n<p id=\"b1535-13\">. Code has maintained throughout these collateral proceedings that he told Stacy that his coworkers at the Central Hotel in Macon could <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"1484\">*1484</page-number>vouch for his whereabouts. The district court found, however, that Code had only supplied Stacy with two leads: his mother, Olivia Code, and his girl friend, Mary Jackson.</p>\n</footnote>\n<footnote label=\"7\">\n<p id=\"b1536-9\">. Dock Gibson, who was shot during the robbery, identified Code in court testifying \"that is a face I\u2019ll never forget.\u201d He could not recall, however, whether Code had a beard at the time of the robbery. Gibson also testified that Code had shot him; however, another prosecution witness, alleged accomplice Sammy Bell, testified that a third accomplice shot Gibson.</p>\n</footnote>\n<footnote label=\"8\">\n<p id=\"b1537-8\">. Code suggests that Stacy\u2019s failure to request a continuance was the product of Stacy\u2019s conflict of interest. Had Stacy requested the continuance, the court would have realized that Stacy\u2019s pretrial investigation was inadequate because he would have had to request the continuance due to the absence of <em>unsubpoenaed </em>witnesses; one of whom he had never spoken with.</p>\n</footnote>\n</opinion>\n</casebody>\n",
