The plaintiffs are seven low-income women who applied under the Section 8 housing assistance payments program, 42 U.S.C. \u00a7 1437f (1982), for admission to two privately owned apartment complexes in the St. Louis metropolitan area. Plaintiffs allege that the denial of their applications violated their federal constitutional rights to procedural due process and equal protection, their rights under Section 8 and the Administrative Procedure Act, 5 U.S.C. \u00a7\u00a7 702 &amp; 706, and their contractual rights as third party beneficiaries. For the reasons discussed below, we affirm the judgment of the District Court.</p>\n<p id=\"b464-19\">I.</p>\n<p id=\"b464-20\">Plaintiffs applied for admission to the Hidden Valley Estates Apartments and the Murphy-Blair Townhouses, both of which are privately owned apartment complexes that participate in the Section 8 low-income housing assistance program. Between September 1983 and May 1984 each of the plaintiffs\u2019 applications was denied by the private owners.<footnotemark>2</footnotemark> Allegedly, though the <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"387\">*387</page-number>District Court made no findings on this issue, each of the plaintiffs satisfied the family and income eligibility requirements of the Section 8 program. Some of the plaintiffs requested and were granted an informal interview with the private owner to discuss the reasons for their denials.</p>\n<p id=\"b465-5\">Plaintiffs brought suit seeking injunctive and declaratory relief against the private owners and operators of the apartment complexes and various state and federal housing agency officials. In particular, plaintiffs alleged that (1) defendants\u2019 failure to provide applicants with uniform, ascertainable admissions standards, adequate and specific written reasons for rejection of their applications for admission, and a prompt and meaningful opportunity for a hearing violated their rights to procedural due process; (2) the failure to accord Section 8 applicants the same procedural protections accorded applicants for conventional public housing under 42 U.S.C. \u00a7 1437 <em>et seq. </em>has no rational basis, and thus violates plaintiffs\u2019 rights to equal protection of the law; (3) defendants\u2019 rejection of plaintiffs\u2019 applications for admission violated their rights under Section 8, 42 U.S.C. \u00a7 1437f (1982); (4) defendants\u2019 rejection of plaintiffs' applications violated their rights as third party beneficiaries of the housing assistance payments contracts between the private owners and the federal and state housing agencies; and (5) the federal defendants\u2019 failure to take affirmative action to enforce the obligations of the private owners under Section 8 fairly and rationally to administer the Section 8 program in accordance with federal constitutional and statutory standards is arbitrary, capricious, and an abuse of discretion in violation of the federal Administrative Procedure Act, 5 U.S.C. \u00a7\u00a7 702 &amp; 706.</p>\n<p id=\"b465-6\">The District Court, upon motion by defendants, dismissed plaintiffs\u2019 complaint without prejudice. <em>Hill v. Group Three Housing Development Corp., </em>620 F.Supp. 355 (E.D.Mo.1985). The court reviewed the statutory scheme, the regulations, and the administrative guidelines developed by the Department of Housing and Urban Development (HUD), and held that they did not create a legitimate claim of entitlement to housing or benefits for Section 8 applicants. <em>Id. </em>at 357. Thus, plaintiffs had no \u201cproperty\u201d right entitled to due process protection. The court dismissed plaintiffs\u2019 other federal statutory claims and the breach of contract claim also on the ground that plaintiffs had no legitimate claim of entitlement under the Section 8 program. <em>Id. </em>at 358. Finally, the court dismissed the equal protection claim on the ground that applicants for Section 8 housing and applicants for conventional public housing are not similarly situated; thus, different treatment of the two classes does not violate equal protection. The court alternatively held that the difference in treatment was rationally related to a legitimate governmental purpose. <em>Id. </em>Plaintiffs appeal from the dismissal of each of their claims.</p>\n<p id=\"b465-12\">II.</p>\n<p id=\"b465-13\">Section 8 was enacted as part of the Housing and Community Development Act of 1974, Pub.L. No. 93-383, 88 Stat. 633 (codified as amended at 42 U.S.C. \u00a7 1437f). The stated purpose of the Section 8 program is to aid lower-income families in obtaining a decent place to live and to promote economically mixed housing. 42 U.S.C. \u00a7 1437f(a); <em>see </em>24 C.F.R. \u00a7 883.101(a) (1984). To that end, the Secretary of HUD is authorized to enter into contracts to make housing assistance payments to private owners of housing in which some or all of the units shall be leased to lower-income families. 42 U.S.C. \u00a7 1437f(b)(l) &amp; (2) (1982).<footnotemark>3</footnotemark> The Secretary also is authorized to enter into annual contributions contracts with public housing agencies pursuant to which such agencies may contract to <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"388\">*388</page-number>make assistance payments to private owners. <em>Id. </em>Under these contracts, the amount of the monthly assistance payment is the difference between the maximum monthly rent provided in the contract between the private owner and the Secretary and the amount the tenant is required to pay as rent. <em>Id. </em>\u00a7 1437f(c)(3).</p>\n<p id=\"b466-4\">The statutory scheme clearly indicates that Congress desired to place responsibility for the operation and management of the Section 8 program, including the selection of tenants, with the private owner. Where the Secretary has contracted directly with the private owner, the statute directs that the contract \u201cshall provide that all ownership, management, and maintenance responsibilities, including the selection of tenants ... shall be assumed by the owner....\u201d <em>Id. </em>\u00a7 1437f(e)(2). Similarly, the statute mandates that contracts between a state public housing agency and a private owner \u201cshall provide ... that the selection of tenants for such unit shall be the function of the owner....\u201d <em>Id. </em>\u00a7 1437f(d)(l)(A). The statutory language clearly evidences a congressional itnent to encourage the participation of the private sector in providing low-income housing by leaving management decisions (which includes the selection of tenants) to the private owner.</p>\n<p id=\"b466-9\">Further evidence of this congressional intent is found in the legislative history to the 1979 amendments to Section 8. The amendments to subsections (d)(1)(A) and (e)(2) reaffirmed the private owner\u2019s exclusive responsibility for tenant selection, but provided that \u201ctenant selection criteria used by the owner shall give preference to families which occupy substandard housing or are involuntarily displaced at the time they are seeking assistance....\u201d Housing and Community Development Amendments of 1979, Pub.L. No. 96-153, \u00a7 206(b)(1) &amp; (2), 93 Stat. 1101, 1108 (amending 42 U.S.C. \u00a7 1437f). The House Report explains, however, that this preference</p>\n<blockquote id=\"ata-dedup-0\">is not intended nor should it be used to allow the Department to direct an owner ... to select certain tenants. It would be unacceptable and clearly not authorized by this provision for the Department to require a[n] ... owner to select tenants from a list developed by the Department. This provision is not intended to alter the basic responsibility over tenant selection which, under current law, rests solely with the ... owner.</blockquote>\n<p id=\"b466-12\">H.R.Rep. No. 154, 96th Cong., 1st Sess. 16 (1979), <em>reprinted in </em>1979 U.S. Code Cong. &amp; Ad. News 2317, 2332.</p>\n<p id=\"b466-13\">The regulations promulgated by HUD for the various Section 8 subprograms<footnotemark>4</footnotemark> also recognize the private owner's discretion in the selection of tenants. <em>See </em>24 C.F.R. \u00a7\u00a7 880.103(d) (stating that \u201cthe owner is responsible for all management functions, including ... selection of tenants....\u201d), 883.103(d), 883.702(b), 886.119(a)(3) (1984). The private owner is responsible for determining whether an applicant satisfies HUD\u2019s income and family eligibility criteria, <em>see </em>24 C.F.R. Parts 812 &amp; 889 (1984), and for the selection of families as tenants. <em>See </em>24 C.F.R. \u00a7\u00a7 880.603(b), 883.101(f), 883.704(b), 886.119(a)(3) (1984). The language used in the regulations clearly makes a distinction between \u201celigibility\u201d and \u201cselection.\u201d Although an applicant may be \u201celigible\u201d in the sense of meeting the threshold statutory income and family criteria, the applicant also must be \u201cotherwise acceptable\u201d to the private owner in order to be selected. <em>See id. </em><page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"389\">*389</page-number>\u00a7\u00a7 880.603(b)(2) &amp; (3), 883.704(b)(2) &amp; (3) (1984).</p>\n<p id=\"b467-4\">HUD also distributes to private owners a handbook, entitled HUD Transmittal Handbook No. 4350.3 (\u201cHUD Handbook\u201d or \u201cHandbook\u201d), which HUD describes as a \u201cone-source rule book,\u201d explaining the administrative policies and procedures governing the Section 8 program. The Handbook suggests that owners should develop a written tenant-selection plan setting forth the reasons for which applicants may be rejected. HUD Handbook U 2-15(c). The Handbook lists permitted screening criteria and states that owners should consider at least the four factors listed, but that they may establish other criteria not otherwise prohibited. Among the permitted screening criteria are (1) demonstrated ability to pay rent on time; (2) comments from former landlords; (3) poor credit references; and (4) housekeeping habits. <em>Id. </em>H 2-16. An owner must comply with all federal, state, and local fair housing and civil rights laws and with all Equal Opportunity requirements. <em>Id. </em>112-18.<footnotemark>5</footnotemark> An owner also is required to comply with various preference rules established by statute, regulation, or otherwise adopted by the owner. <em>Id. </em>112-19.</p>\n<p id=\"b467-5\">Subject to those limitations, the Handbook states that an owner may reject an applicant if the \u201capplicant does not meet the owner\u2019s tenant selection criteria.\u201d <em>Id. </em>H 2-21(a)(4). If an applicant is rejected, the owner is required promptly to notify the applicant in writing of the rejection, explain the reasons for the rejection, and advise the applicant that he or she has 14 days to respond in writing or to request an informal meeting to discuss the rejection with a member of the owner\u2019s staff. <em>Id. </em>112-21(b)-(d); <em>see also </em>24 C.F.R. \u00a7 883.704(b)(3) (1984). There is no formal review procedure by HUD or any other federal or state agency of a private owner\u2019s rejection of an applicant.<footnotemark>6</footnotemark></p>\n<p id=\"b467-8\">III.</p>\n<p id=\"b467-9\">A.</p>\n<p id=\"b467-10\">Plaintiffs first contend that applicants acquire a \u201cproperty\u201d right in the receipt of Section 8 housing benefits at the time they establish their income and family eligibility. Plaintiffs\u2019 due process argument is premised on a combination of two different propositions. First, plaintiffs assert that the Section 8 housing program was intended to benefit low-income families. Plaintiffs further assert that they meet the statutory income and family eligibility requirements of the Section 8 program, and therefore are within the class of persons for whom the Section 8 program was intended to benefit. Thus, their argument goes, because they are members of the class of intended beneficiaries of the Section 8 program, their likelihood of receiving Section 8 benefits is substantial enough to merit due process protection. Second, plaintiffs contend that although income and family eligibility alone does not guarantee receipt of Section 8 benefits, the statute, the regulations, and the HUD Handbook use such mandatory language and impose such significant, substantive limitations on a private owner\u2019s discretion in the tenant-selection process that an eligible applicant\u2019s likelihood of receiving Section 8 benefits is sufficient to create a property interest entitled to due process protection.</p>\n<p id=\"b468-3\"><page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"390\">*390</page-number>Under the current two-prong procedural due process analysis, plaintiffs first must establish that they have a protected \u201cproperty\u201d interest in the benefits sought. The Supreme Court articulated the proper standard to determine the existence of a property interest in the seminal case of <em>Board of Regents v. Roth, </em>408 U.S. 564, 577, 92 S.Ct. 2701, 2709, 33 L.Ed.2d 548 (1972): \u201cTo have a property interest in a benefit, a person clearly must have more than an abstract need or desire for it. He must have more than a unilateral expectation of it. He must, instead, have a legitimate claim of entitlement to it.\u201d Thus, plaintiffs must establish that applicants have a \u201clegitimate claim of entitlement\u201d to Section 8 benefits merely upon a showing that they satisfy the statutory income and family eligibility requirements.<footnotemark>7</footnotemark></p>\n<p id=\"b468-4\">Plaintiffs rely primarily on two cases to support their position. In <em>Ressler v. Pierce, </em>692 F.2d 1212, 1214-16 (9th Cir.1982), the Ninth Circuit held that applicants have a constitutionally protected property interest in Section 8 benefits entitling them to procedural safeguards in the application and tenant-selection process. The Ninth Circuit based its holding on two factors. First, the court stated that private owners \u201cha[ve] only limited discretion in the Section 8 application and selection process.\u201d <em>Id. </em>at 1215. The court distinguished one of its prior cases finding no property interest on the ground that in that case the entity charged with dispensing the governmental benefits had \u201cunbridled discretion\u201d in the selection process. <em>Id. </em>(distinguishing <em>City of Santa Clara v. Andrus, </em>572 F.2d 660 (9th Cir.1978)). In contrast, although apparently conceding that the statute itself imposed no limitations, the <em>Ressler </em>court stated that the regulations and HUD Handbook guidelines \u201cclosely circumscribe an owner\u2019s discretion\u201d in the Section 8 tenant-selection process. 692 F.2d at 1215. Second, the <em>Ressler </em>court found a property interest in Section 8 benefits \u201cby virtue of [an applicant\u2019s] membership in a class of individuals whom the Section 8 program was intended to benefit.\u201d <em>Id.</em></p>\n<p id=\"b468-7\">The second case on which plaintiffs rely is <em>Greenholtz v. Inmates of Nebraska Penal and Correctional Complex, </em>442 U.S. 1, 99 S.Ct. 2100, 60 L.Ed.2d 668 (1979). In <em>Greenholtz </em>the Supreme Court held that a Nebraska parole statute provided a sufficient expectancy of release to create a \u201cliberty\u201d interest entitled to some constitutional protection. <em>Id. </em>442 U.S. at 12, 99 S.Ct. at 2106. The statute provided that the Board of Parole \u201cshall\u201d release an eligible inmate \u201cunless\u201d one of four statutory factors was applicable. The statute also listed fourteen factors (including one \u201ccatch-all\u201d factor allowing consideration of any other relevant matter) that the Board was required to consider in making its parole release decision. The Court, however, was quick to emphasize the \u201cunique structure and language\u201d of the Nebraska parole statute, and noted that other statutes should be considered on a case-by-case basis. <em>Id. </em>The Court also noted that the mere <em>possibility </em>of parole did not create a protected interest. <em>Id. </em>at 11, 99 S.Ct. at 2105.</p>\n<p id=\"b468-8\">Plaintiffs argue that the Section 8 regulations and HUD Handbook contain similar structure and mandatory language in their tenant-selection provisions. Specifically, plaintiffs cite to regulations providing that</p>\n<blockquote id=\"aqt-dedup-0\">[i]f the owner determines that the family is eligible and is otherwise acceptable and units are available, the owner will assign the family a unit____ If no suitable unit is available, the owner will place the family on a waiting list for the project and notify the family of when a suitable unit may become available.</blockquote>\n<p id=\"b469-3\"><page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"391\">*391</page-number>24 C.F.R. \u00a7\u00a7 880.603(b)(2), 883.704(b)(2); <em>see also </em>HUD Handbook \u00b6 2-20. In addition, plaintiffs cite to the Handbook provisions regarding applicant preferences, selection criteria, and restrictions on private owners in the tenant-selection process, <em>see supra </em>Part II, at 389-90, to support their contention that an owner\u2019s discretion is sufficiently limited to establish an applicant\u2019s legitimate claim of entitlement to Section 8 benefits.</p>\n<p id=\"b469-4\">We reject plaintiffs\u2019 contention that Section 8 applicants possess a property right simply by virtue of their membership in the class (low-income families) that Section 8 was intended to benefit. As noted above, this factor was relied upon by the Ninth Circuit in <em>Ressler. </em>Although this factor is a starting point for due process analysis, in our view it is far from dispositive of the question whether an individual applicant has a legitimate claim of entitlement to Section 8 benefits. No individual applicant, though perhaps <em>eligible </em>for Section 8 benefits, is necessarily <em>entitled </em>to such benefits. The private owner retains broad discretion to select a tenant from among the eligible applicants, and is free within wide limits to turn away eligible applicants. Thus, we cannot agree that proof of membership in the class to be benefitted satisfies the plaintiffs\u2019 burden of establishing a legitimate claim of entitlement to Section 8 housing.</p>\n<p id=\"b469-5\">Nor do we agree with plaintiffs\u2019 contention that the Section 8 regulations and HUD Handbook use such mandatory language and impose such significant, substantive limitations on a private owner\u2019s discretion in the tenant-selection process that applicants acquire a property interest at the time they establish income and family eligibility. In rejecting plaintiffs\u2019 argument, we expressly note our agreement with the reasoning of the Seventh Circuit in <em>Eidson v. Pierce, </em>745 F.2d 453 (7th Cir.1984). The Seventh Circuit noted that the Section 8 statute, regulations, and HUD Handbook guidelines \u201ccircumscribe to some extent the owner\u2019s discretion in selecting tenants.\u201d <em>Id. </em>at 459. But that fact alone was not sufficient to create a property interest in view of the broad discretion vested in the owner in the tenant-selection process.</p>\n<blockquote id=\"b469-7\">The selection of tenants is obviously not left to the owner\u2019s unfettered discretion. Section 8 requires the owner to apply the eligibility criteria based on income and family size. In addition, preference must be given to certain subclasses of eligible applicants.... Nevertheless, Section 8 contemplates a selection process involving other, less tangible factors in addition to statutory eligibility. The owner may determine that a family is eligible and \u201cotherwise acceptable,\u201d or the owner may reject an application based on statutory criteria or for \u201cother reasons.\u201d The HUD Handbook makes it clear that the program contemplates private owners determining whether eligible applicants are likely to be responsible tenants.</blockquote>\n<p id=\"b469-10\">\n<em>Id.</em>\n</p>\n<p id=\"b469-11\">The <em>Eidson </em>court expressly rejected the Ninth Circuit\u2019s analysis in <em>Ressler </em>on this point.</p>\n<blockquote id=\"b469-12\">The cited limitations [relied upon by the <em>Ressler </em>court] affect the allocation of Section 8 benefits among certain subclasses of eligible persons.... These criteria which benefit certain subclasses of eligible [applicants] do not, however, affect an owner\u2019s choice between two similar, eligible <em>individual </em>applicants. The law does not tell the owner how to decide who is more likely to be a responsible tenant, and the law does not question the owner\u2019s decision so long as it does not involve invidious discrimination. Although ... the statute and HUD\u2019s administrative guidelines provide some standards of eligibility, reliance on these alone does not take into account an owner\u2019s discretion and therefore can hardly furnish an adequate framework for due process hearings to distinguish \u201cworthy\u201d from \u201cunworthy\u201d applicants.</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b469-14\">We believe \u2014 without appraising the merits of its decision \u2014 that Congress intended that a rent subsidy be paid on behalf of only those tenants whom an <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"392\">*392</page-number>owner has selected. But broad discretion was left in the owner to make the selection.</blockquote>\n<p id=\"b470-4\"><em>Id. </em>at 463.</p>\n<p id=\"b470-5\">Like the <em>Eidson </em>court, we do not believe that the procedures and limitations imposed by the Section 8 regulations and the HUD guidelines on an owner\u2019s discretion in the tenant-selection process rise to the level required to establish a property interest.<footnotemark>8</footnotemark> The Section 8 statute, regulations, and HUD guidelines do not use \u201clanguage of an unmistakably mandatory character,\u201d <em>Hewitt v. Helms, </em>459 U.S. 460, 471, 103 S.Ct. 864, 871, 74 L.Ed.2d 675 (1983), similar in substance or form to those statutes found sufficient to create a protected interest. Nor do they contain \u201cparticularized substantive standards or criteria which significantly guide\u201d an owner\u2019s discretion in tenant selection. <em>Parker v. Corrothers, </em>750 F.2d 653, 656 (8th Cir.1984). The substantive limitations on an owner\u2019s discretion are minimal. There remains much room for an owner\u2019s exercise of discretion and business judgment. <em>See Phelps v. Housing Authority, </em>742 F.2d 816, 822-23 (4th Cir.1984); <em>cf. Olim v. Wakinekona, </em>461 U.S. 238, 249, 103 S.Ct. 1741, 1747, 75 L.Ed.2d 813 (1983); <em>Connecticut Board of Pardons v. Dumschat, </em>452 U.S. 458, 467, 101 S.Ct. 2460, 2465, 69 L.Ed.2d 158 (1981) (Brennan, J., concurring). As the <em>Eidson </em>court noted, \u201cSection 8 entitlements depend on discretionary judgments which, in some respects, are not constrained by any legal criteria.\u201d 745 F.2d at 462. Finally, the fact that certain procedures are mandated for the processing of Section 8 applications does not establish a constitutionally protected property right. <em>See Olim, </em>461 U.S. at 250, 103 S.Ct. at 1748 (\u201cProcess is not an end in itself.\u201d); <em>Hewitt, </em>459 U.S. at 471, 103 S.Ct. at 871 (stating that \u201cthe creation of procedural guidelines to channel the decision-making\u201d of state officials does not alone create a property or liberty interest); <em>Hogue v. Clinton, </em>791 F.2d 1318, 1324 (8th Cir.1986) (suggesting that the procedures mandated must place \u201csignificant substantive restrictions on the decision-making\u201d); <em>Lyon v. Farrier, </em>727 F.2d 766, 768 (8th Cir.) (stating that \u201cprocedural protections alone, absent an underlying substantive entitlement, do not constitute substantive, protected interests\u201d), <em>cert. denied, </em>469 U.S. 839, 105 S.Ct. 140, 83 L.Ed.2d 79 (1984); <em>Vruno v. Schwarzwalder, </em>600 F.2d 124, 130 (8th Cir.1979) (holding that although statute provided for procedures and guidelines for state and local officials to follow, it did not establish property right or claim of entitlement to public employment).</p>\n<p id=\"b470-11\">The <em>Eidson </em>court found other fatal deficiencies in the plaintiff-applicants\u2019 due process theory.</p>\n<blockquote id=\"b470-12\">The plaintiffs\u2019 central difficulty may be framed by asking, as a practical matter, what would be at issue in the hearings plaintiffs seek.</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b470-13\">The plaintiffs\u2019 applications were rejected on the basis of unfavorable information from prior landlords and credit checks. At first blush, such information appears to be similar to that involved in the termination of plaintiffs\u2019 welfare payments in <em>Goldberg v. Kelly </em>[, 397 U.S. 254, 90 S.Ct. 1011, 25 L.Ed.2d 28]. The information may well be of questionable reliability, and the plaintiffs here might, at hearings, be able to refute the damaging information which was ostensibly the <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"393\">*393</page-number>basis for the rejections. But even if the plaintiffs proved that the information was false, they would still not be entitled to Section 8 housing. They are <em>entitled </em>to housing, as opposed to eligible for it, only after a private owner accepts their applications. The owner\u2019s decision is subject to some statutory, regulatory and contractual limits, but those limits apply only to <em>classes </em>of potential tenants. The law does not tell the owner how to choose between two eligible individuals. The owner remains free to accept applications only from those persons he or she expects to be responsible tenants, and the Section 8 program does not constrain the owner\u2019s judgment on that question.</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b471-5\">That is the controlling difference between these cases and <em>Goldberg v. Kelly, </em>for a mandatory hearing would do little either to benefit the applicant or to promote the public interest. In <em>Goldberg </em>and numerous other public benefit cases, the law established eligibility criteria, and any person who satisfied those factual criteria was entitled to the benefits. A hearing would thus be an effective remedy for the individual because it would provide a reliable means for resolving disputed facts entitling the person to benefits. Section 8 is not, however, a simple entitlement program. The eligible [applicant] must be accepted by a private landlord in order to receive benefits. Factual findings at a hearing could therefore not entitle these plaintiffs to Section 8 benefits.</blockquote>\n<p id=\"b471-6\">745 F.2d at 460-61.</p>\n<p id=\"b471-7\">We agree with this reasoning.<footnotemark>9</footnotemark> Even if Section 8 applicants rejected by an owner were to receive a hearing, there still is nothing that legally would <em>require </em>the owner to accept the applicant. To borrow from the language in <em>Greenholtz, </em>the tenant-selection process is</p>\n<blockquote id=\"And\">subtle and depends on an amalgam of elements, some of which are factual but many of which are purely subjective appraisals by the [private owners] based upon their experience with the difficult and sensitive task of evaluating the [responsibility of tenant applicants]____ [T]here is no set of facts which, if shown, mandate a decision favorable to the individual.</blockquote>\n<p id=\"b471-12\">442 U.S. at 9-10, 99 S.Ct. at 2104-05. In short, while the selection of tenants is not left to the private owner\u2019s unfettered discretion, absent invidious discrimination the actual selection of individual tenants from among the class of otherwise eligible applicants is left exclusively to the owner\u2019s business judgment and discretion.</p>\n<p id=\"b471-13\">For the reasons stated above, we hold that applicants do not acquire a \u201clegitimate claim of entitlement\u201d to or a \u201cproperty\u201d interest in the receipt of Section 8 benefits merely upon proof that they satisfy the statutory income and family eligibility requirements. We therefore affirm the District Court\u2019s dismissal of plaintiffs\u2019 procedural due process claim in count I of the complaint.</p>\n<p id=\"b471-14\">B.</p>\n<p id=\"b471-15\">Plaintiffs next contend that the failure to accord Section 8 applicants the same procedural safeguards accorded applicants for <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"394\">*394</page-number>conventional public housing under 42 U.S.C. \u00a7 1437 <em>et seq. </em>is not rationally related to any legitimate governmental objective, and thus violates plaintiffs\u2019 rights to equal protection of the laws.</p>\n<p id=\"b472-4\">We agree with the District Court that equal protection analysis is not applicable here since the two groups of applicants are not similarly situated. The two classifications result from two separate statutes representing two different approaches to the provision of housing for low-incom\u00e9 persons. Each statute on its face admits of only one class \u2014 low-income families. What plaintiffs in essence are complaining about is a policy choice made by the same body politic within whose jurisdiction this dispute properly and exclusively belongs \u2014 Congress. We therefore affirm the District Court\u2019s dismissal of plaintiffs\u2019 equal protection claim in count II of the complaint.</p>\n<p id=\"b472-5\">C.</p>\n<p id=\"b472-6\">Plaintiffs next contend that defendants\u2019 refusal to rent apartments to them, notwithstanding the fact that they met all the statutory eligibility criteria, violated their rights under Section 8. We note that plaintiffs failed to specify in their complaint exactly what \u201crights\u201d under Section 8 defendants allegedly violated by rejecting their applications. In any event, we do not believe that Congress intended to permit an implied private right of action under Section 8 by rejected applicants.</p>\n<p id=\"b472-7\">In determining whether there is an implied private right of action under a federal statute not expressly providing for one, the Supreme Court has developed a four-factor test. The plaintiff must show that (1) he is a member of the class for whose especial benefit the statute was enacted and that the statute creates a federal right in his favor; (2) there is some indication of legislative intent to create such a remedy; (3) it is consistent with the underlying purposes of the legislative scheme to imply such a remedy; and that (4) the cause of action is not one traditionally relegated to state law such that it would be inappropriate to infer a cause of action based solely on federal law. <em>Cort v. Ash, </em>422 U.S. 66, 78, 95 S.Ct. 2080, 2087, 45 L.Ed.2d 26 (1975).<footnotemark>10</footnotemark> The focus is on congressional intent.</p>\n<p id=\"b472-10\">After reviewing the statute, the regulations, and the HUD Handbook guidelines governing the Section 8 program, we are of the opinion that Congress did not intend to create enforceable rights for individual applicants nor to allow private enforcement of the Section 8 program. Thus, we hold that plaintiffs have no implied private right of action under Section 8.</p>\n<p id=\"b472-11\">First, we agree with the Fourth Circuit\u2019s reasoning in a similar case that, although the Section 8 statute and regulations clearly manifest congressional intent to benefit low-income families generally, <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"395\">*395</page-number><em>Phelps v. Housing Authority, </em>742 F.2d 816, 821 (4th Cir.1984). As the Fourth Circuit noted, HUD is involved in some way in nearly every aspect of the Section 8 program, and possesses power commensurate with its responsibility for effective enforcement of the program. <em>See, e.g., </em>24 C.F.R. \u00a7\u00a7 880.504, 880.505, 880.603, 883.-605, 883.713(b), 886.129, 886.130 (1984) (specifying HUD\u2019s power to enforce sanctions for noncompliance with Section 8 contracts, its powers of review, and its responsibilities for the administration of Section 8 contracts).</p>\n<blockquote id=\"AK2\"><page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"394\">*394</page-number>its chosen means of accomplishing that end is plainly that HUD, rather than private litigants, is to be the enforcer of the statutory directive. Apart from the obvious lack of any affirmative statutory language indicating a Congressional intention to allow private remedial suits, the statute is replete with indications of an intention to entrust HUD with the means and the responsibility for effective enforcement____ In sum, the whole of the legislative scheme ... indicates Congress\u2019s intention that HUD should continue to enforce required conditions by means of asserting its rights under the [housing assistance payments contracts], thereby intending \u201cto foreclose private enforcement\u201d of the requirements of the Housing Act.</blockquote>\n<p id=\"b473-5\"><page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"395\">*395</page-number>Second, our holding in Part III.A., <em>supra, </em>that Section 8 applicants possess no property right to housing benefits necessarily disposes of plaintiffs\u2019 claim to rights under the statute itself. If applicants had any legitimate claim of entitlement to housing under the statute, they <em>ipso facto </em>would have a protected property right for purposes of due process analysis. We agree with the <em>Eidson </em>court that \u201cthere is nothing to suggest that Congress intended potential tenants [applicants] of Section 8 projects to have enforceable rights to Section 8 housing in particular projects.\u201d 745 F.2d at 462.</p>\n<p id=\"b473-6\">Holding that plaintiffs have neither an enforceable right to Section 8 housing nor an implied private right of action under the statute, we affirm the District Court\u2019s dismissal of plaintiffs\u2019 claim under Section 8 in count III of the complaint.</p>\n<p id=\"b473-7\">D.</p>\n<p id=\"b473-8\">Plaintiffs\u2019 next claim is that the private owners\u2019 rejection of their applications for admission, notwithstanding the fact that plaintiffs met the statutory income and family eligibility criteria, violated plaintiffs\u2019 rights as third party intended beneficiaries of the housing assistance payments contracts between the private owners and the federal and state housing agencies.</p>\n<p id=\"b473-11\">We find this claim to be without merit. As discussed above, individual applicants have no right of admission to any particular Section 8 housing project, regardless of the fact that they may satisfy the threshold eligibility criteria. In all cases, the individual applicant still must be \u201cotherwise acceptable\u201d to the private owner. Plaintiffs have not referred us to any provision in the contract or elsewhere that is to the contrary.<footnotemark>11</footnotemark> Thus, even assuming <em>arguendo </em>that plaintiffs as Section 8 applicants could be considered intended third party beneficiaries of the housing contract, an issue we do not decide, <em>compare Holbrook v. Pitt, </em>643 F.2d 1261, 1271-73 (7th Cir.1981) (holding that existing <em>tenants </em>\u2014not applicants \u2014 had enforceable rights under contracts as intended third party beneficiaries) <em>with Perry v. Housing Authority, </em>664 F.2d 1210, 1218 (4th Cir.1981) (holding that existing tenants were not intended third party beneficiaries), the right plaintiffs seek to have judicially recognized and enforced simply does not exist. We therefore affirm the District Court\u2019s dismissal of plaintiffs\u2019 breach of contract claim in count IV of the complaint.</p>\n<p id=\"b473-12\">E.</p>\n<p id=\"b473-13\">Plaintiffs\u2019 final contention is that defendant federal and state housing officials have failed to enforce the obligations of the private owners fairly and rationally to administer the Section 8 program in accordance with federal statutory and constitutional standards. This failure, plaintiffs contend, was arbitrary, capricious, and an abuse of discretion and has resulted in plaintiffs\u2019 federal statutory and constitutional rights being violated, thus entitling plaintiffs to relief under the federal Administrative Procedure Act (APA), 5 U.S.C. \u00a7\u00a7 702 &amp; 706.</p>\n<p id=\"b474-3\"><page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"396\">*396</page-number>The APA\u2019s comprehensive provisions for judicial review of \u201cagency actions\u201d are contained in 5 U.S.C. \u00a7\u00a7 701-706. Any person \u201cadversely affected or aggrieved\u201d by final agency action, including a failure to act, is entitled to judicial review thereof. 5 U.S.C. \u00a7 702. Defendants, however, maintain that, even assuming there has been a violation of plaintiffs\u2019 rights, which they deny, HUD\u2019s decision not to take enforcement action in this case against the private owners is a decision committed to the agency\u2019s absolute discretion, and thus is not subject to judicial review under the APA. <em>See </em>5 U.S.C. \u00a7 701(a)(2).</p>\n<p id=\"b474-4\">Section 701(a)(2) of the APA precludes judicial review of any action or decision by an administrative agency to the extent that \u201cagency action is committed to agency discretion by law.\u201d The Supreme Court has stated, however, that \u00a7 701(a)(2) \u201cis a very narrow exception\u201d that only applies \u201cin those rare instances where \u2018statutes are drawn in such broad terms that in a given case there is no law to apply.\u2019 \u201d <em>Citizens to Preserve Overton Park v. Volpe, </em>401 U.S. 402, 410, 91 S.Ct. 814, 820, 28 L.Ed.2d 136 (1971) (quoting S.Rep. No. 752, 79th Cong., 1st Sess. 26 (1945)). In other words, judicial review is precluded only when \u201cthe statute is drawn so that a court would have no meaningful standard against which to judge the agency\u2019s exercise of discretion.\u201d <em>Heckler v. Chaney, </em>470 U.S. 821, 105 S.Ct. 1649, 1655, 84 L.Ed.2d 714 (1985).</p>\n<p id=\"b474-5\">However, in cases involving an agency\u2019s decision not to take enforcement action, the Court in <em>Chaney </em>created a \u201cpresumption of unreviewability.\u201d <em>Id. </em>105 S.Ct. at 1657; <em>see also id. </em>at 1656 (stating that \u201can agency\u2019s decision not to prosecute or enforce, whether through civil or criminal process, is a decision generally committed to an agency\u2019s absolute discretion\u201d and \u201cshould be presumed immune from judicial review under \u00a7 701(a)(2)\u201d). The Court explained that</p>\n<blockquote id=\"b474-6\">the presumption may be rebutted where the substantive statute has provided guidelines for the agency to follow in exercising its enforcement powers. Thus, in establishing this presumption in the APA, Congress did not set agencies free to disregard legislative direction in the statutory scheme that the agency administers. Congress may limit an agency\u2019s exercise of enforcement power if it wishes, either by setting substantive priorities, or by otherwise circumscribing an agency\u2019s power to discriminate among issues or cases it will pursue____</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b474-11\">... If [Congress] has indicated an intent to circumscribe agency enforcement discretion, and has provided meaningful standards for defining the limits of that discretion, there is \u201claw to apply\u201d under \u00a7 701(a)(2), and courts may require that the agency follow that law; if it has not, then an agency refusal to institute proceedings is a decision \u201ccommitted to agency discretion by law\u201d within the meaning of that section.</blockquote>\n<p id=\"b474-12\"><em>Id. </em>at 1656-58. Thus, the question presented is whether Congress has provided \u201cmeaningful standards for defining the limits\u201d of HUD\u2019s enforcement discretion under Section 8 such that there is \u201claw to apply\u201d under \u00a7 701(a)(2) for purposes of judicial review.</p>\n<p id=\"b474-13\">We note that plaintiffs again have failed to specify exactly what \u201cobligations of the [private] owners\u201d under Section 8 HUD allegedly has refused to enforce. Significantly, plaintiffs have not alleged any form of discrimination expressly prohibited by the Section 8 statute, regulations, or HUD Handbook guidelines. <em>See, e.g., </em>24 C.F.R. \u00a7 883.704(b)(1) (1984) (limiting the use of local residency requirements); 24 C.F.R. \u00a7\u00a7 880.210, 880.601, 883.312, 883.702, 886.-114, 886.119 (1984) (requiring compliance with federal fair housing and equal opportunity laws and other federal statutes); HUD Handbook \u00b6 2-18 (same). Moreover, we already have found plaintiffs\u2019 allegations of federal constitutional and statutory-violations to be without merit. Thus, plaintiffs\u2019 claim boils down to an argument that HUD and state housing officials were required under Section 8 to ensure that the private owners gave full and fair considera<page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"397\">*397</page-number>tion to their applications in the tenant-selection process and complied with all provisions of the statute, regulations, and HUD\u2019s administrative rules.</p>\n<p id=\"b475-5\">The fatal flaw in plaintiffs\u2019 claim is that it again assumes a nonexistent right and fails to take into account the fact that a private owner has broad discretion in the tenant-selection process of the Section 8 program. Absent an allegation of unlawful discrimination or a \u201ccolorable claim ... that the agency\u2019s refusal to institute proceedings violated any constitutional rights,\u201d <em>Chaney, </em>105 S.Ct. at 1659; <em>see also id. </em>at 1660 (Brennan, J., concurring), courts simply are not guided by any \u201cmeaningful standards\u201d in the statute, regulations, or HUD guidelines by which to assess either the private owner\u2019s rejection of an applicant found \u201cunacceptable\u201d or HUD\u2019s refusal to take enforcement action. There is, in other words, no \u201claw to apply.\u201d Congress has not provided for HUD review of a private owner\u2019s rejection of an applicant based on the owner\u2019s business judgment and subjective appraisal of the responsibility of the applicant. Thus, we conclude that the enforcement provisions of Section 8 do not contain \u201cmeaningful standards\u201d sufficient to rebut the presumption of unreviewability under \u00a7 701(a)(2). It follows that HUD\u2019s failure to take enforcement action against the private owners in this case is not subject to judicial review. We affirm the District Court\u2019s dismissal of plaintiffs\u2019 claim under the APA in count V of the complaint.</p>\n<p id=\"b475-6\">IV.</p>\n<p id=\"b475-7\">For the reasons stated above, we hold that (1) plaintiffs have no \u201cproperty\u201d right to Section 8 housing benefits that entitles them to procedural due process when private owners make their tenant selections; (2) applicants for Section 8 housing and applicants for conventional public housing are not similarly situated; therefore Section 8 applicants are not denied equal protection when they are not accorded the same procedural safeguards accorded applicants for conventional public housing; (3) plaintiffs have no implied private right of action under Section 8; (4) plaintiffs have no enforceable rights as third party beneficiaries under the housing assistance payments contracts between the private owners and the federal and state housing agencies since those contracts establish no entitlement to housing for any particular applicant; and (5) HUD\u2019s failure to take action to enforce the obligations of private owners under Section 8 in regard to the tenant-selection process is not subject to judicial review under the APA.

The provision in \u00a7 1437f(b)(2) regarding assistance payments on behalf of tenants in newly constructed or substantially rehabilitated housing was repealed in the Housing and Urban-Rural Recovery Act of 1983, Pub.L.

There is disagreement between the parties regarding which Section 8 subprograms are at issue in this case. Plaintiffs alleged in their complaint that the two housing projects in question received assistance payments under the Section 8 New Construction subprogram, 24 C.F.R. Part 880 (1984). Defendants, however, maintain that the Hidden Valley project involves the Part 883 subprogram (under which financing for privately owned housing projects is made through public housing agencies) and that the Murphy-Blair project involves the Part 886 \u201cSection 8 Set-Aside\u201d subprogram (under which assistance payments are made to private owners of housing with mortgages insured by the Federal Housing Administration). Regardless of the subprograms involved, the tenant selection rights of private owners are the same for all three subprograms.</p>\n</footnote>\n<footnote label=\"5\">\n<p id=\"b467-6\">. Thus, an owner may not discriminate on the basis of race, color, religion, sex, national origin, age, or handicap. In addition, the HUD Handbook prohibits discrimination against members of certain classes. For example, an owner may not discriminate against families with children or certain socioeconomic classes <em>(e.g., </em>welfare recipients, single parent households, etc.). <em>See </em>HUD Handbook f 2-18 and Figure 2-2.</p>\n</footnote>\n<footnote label=\"6\">\n<p id=\"b467-11\">. The Handbook, however, does provide that complaints alleging violations of the nondiscrimination provisions (i.e., the fair housing and civil rights laws) must be referred to the HUD Regional Office of Fair Housing and Equal Opportunity. HUD Handbook 1f 2-18(c). Plaintiffs do not allege in their complaint that the private owners were guilty of any form of discrimination prohibited by federal, state, or local statute or by HUD rules or regulations in rejecting their applications.</p>\n</footnote>\n<footnote label=\"7\">\n<p id=\"b468-5\">.

We agree with plaintiffs that in determining whether such \u201crules or understandings\u201d are present in the instant case, we properly may look to the statute, the regulations, and the HUD Handbook. <em>See Parker v.

The same provision in the regulations cited by plaintiffs in support of their argument clearly exposes the fatal weakness in their argument.

Those cases dealt with the Section 8 Certificate of Family Participation \"Finders Keepers\u201d program. The relevant regulations there required that applicants who satisfied the specific, objective eligibility criteria be issued a certificate. The <em>Baker </em>and <em>Vandermark </em>courts held that eligible applicants have a property interest in the certificate. Significantly, however, the <em>Baker </em>court expressly noted that a right to Section 8 housing did not attach upon issuance of the certificate.

Private owners retained discretion in tenant selection, and rejection by the owner may deprive the applicant of Section 8 housing even though a certificate had been issued. 490 F.Supp. at 532.

A similar two-factor inquiry is made in determining whether the violation of a particular federal statute gives rise to liability under 42 U.S.C. \u00a7 1983.
