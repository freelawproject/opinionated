(\u201cCello\u201d), a company founded and partially managed by him, which produces audio equipment designed by him, appeal an order of the District of Connecticut, Warren W. Eginton, <em>Judge, </em>enjoining Cello and Levinson from, among other things, publicizing the fact that Levinson works for Cello. Plaintiff, Madrigal Audio Laboratories, Inc. (\u201cMadrigal\u201d), purchased the Levinson trade name and trademark from Mark Levinson Audio Systems, Inc. (\u201cMLAS\u201d), a company Levinson had founded in the early 1970\u2019s to produce audio equipment and which was forced into bankruptcy in late 1984.</p>\n<p id=\"b892-12\">In this action by Madrigal for trademark infringement and unfair competition Judge Eginton in May 1985 enjoined Cello and Levinson from using the Levinson name and mark (\u201cthe 1985 injunction\u201d). Neither Cello nor Levinson appealed from that order. In February, 1986, however, Judge Eginton issued a second preliminary injunction (\u201cthe 1986 injunction\u201d) (1) barring Lev-inson and Cello \u201cfrom generating any publicity\u201d regarding Levinson\u2019s relationship with Cello or past relationship with MLAS, (2) enjoining Levinson from communicating with dealers or customers on Cello\u2019s behalf, and (3) ordering Cello to inform all persons who had received Cello publicity brochures advertising Levinson\u2019s designing of products for Cello that Madrigal owned the Levinson trade name and trademark. We reverse the district court\u2019s order and dismiss Madrigal\u2019s cross-appeal.</p>\n<p id=\"b892-16\">BACKGROUND</p>\n<p id=\"b892-17\">In 1971 Mark Levinson founded MLAS to produce \u201chigh-end\u201d audio equipment to his design. In the audio industry \u201chigh-end\u201d products are expensive and relatively sophisticated. Levinson incorporated MLAS in 1976. Though Levinson\u2019s designs were of high quality, by 1980 MLAS was in serious financial troubled Levinson then asked Sanford Berlin, a retired executive in the audio industry, to invest in MLAS and to aid in the management of the company, which' Berlin did, personally investing $480,000 in the company and persuading several others to invest an additional $300,-000.</p>\n<p id=\"b892-18\">At Berlin\u2019s request, Levinson entered into an \u201cEmployment Agreement\u201d with MLAS in December 1980, under which Lev-inson agreed to work exclusively for MLAS as an advisor to management and as a developer of audio equipment in exchange for an annual salary of $15,000. He also agreed that, should he leave MLAS\u2019 employ, he would not engage in the audio business \u201canywhere in the world\u201d until December 31, 1988. Finally, the Agreement stated that if Levinson \u201ccease[d] to be employed by [MLAS]\u201d he would \u201cnot thereafter use or permit the use of the name \u2018Mark Levinson,\u2019 \u2018Mark Levinson Audio,\u2019 or any other name including \u2018Mark Levinson\u2019 <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"817\">*817</page-number>in the name or trademark of any corporation\u201d engaged in a business similar to that of MLAS.</p>\n<p id=\"b893-4\">Less than two years later, in March 1982, Levinson entered into a second agreement with MLAS. In it MLAS agreed to increase his salary to $25,600 per year \u201ceffective as of July 1, 1982\u201d and $38,600 per year \u201ceffective as of January 1, 1984.\u201d In return, Levinson agreed to continue to work exclusively for MLAS, to convey \u201cto MLAS the permanent and exclusive right, title and interest to the trade name \u2018Mark Levinson\u2019, and all variations thereof, in connection with the sale [and] distribution\u201d of audio equipment and not to use or permit the use of the Levinson trade name, other than by MLAS, in connection with the audio business. The parties defined use of the Levinson trade name as \u201cuse of such trade name, or variation thereof, (a) as part of the name of a corporation, partnership, joint venture, proprietorship, firm or business or (b) as the name, symbol or identification of any product.\u201d Under Berlin\u2019s management, MLAS produced a series of audio products under the \u201cMark Levinson\u201d label.</p>\n<p id=\"b893-5\">Despite the 1982 agreement, Levinson\u2019s relationship with MLAS\u2019 new management deteriorated. In early 1983 Berlin placed Levinson\u2019s salary in escrow. In the summer of 1984 Levinson left MLAS and founded another company to produce audio equipment, defendant Cello, Ltd. Levinson became president and was one of the three directors of Cello. His father and stepmother were the other two directors, and his father owned 75% of Cello\u2019s shares. MLAS never claimed that Levinson\u2019s conduct violated his agreement not to compete against it in the audio business.</p>\n<p id=\"b893-6\">In October, 1984, three creditors forced MLAS into bankruptcy. Shortly after-wards, Berlin founded Madrigal. MLAS\u2019 assets were auctioned on January 31, 1985. The \u201cNotice of Sale of Debtor\u2019s Property at Public Auction\u201d listed \u201cthe trade name, Mark Levinson Audio Systems, Ltd.\u201d, among the assets to be auctioned. There was no mention of Levinson\u2019s employment contract with MLAS or of its non-competition terms. Madrigal, bidding against Cello, acquired, in the words of the bankruptcy trustee\u2019s bill of sale, \u201call of [MLAS\u2019] equipment, inventory, parts, finished and semi-finished goods, office furniture, blueprints and trademark and tradename rights inculding [sic] those arising under agreement dated December 30, 1980 and March 4, 1982 between Mark Levinson ... and [MLAS]\u201d for $150,000. Once again, there was no mention of Levinson\u2019s agreement not to compete against MLAS.</p>\n<p id=\"b893-8\">Cello began marketing its first product, the \u201caudio palette\u201d, in February, 1985. The palette sells for $9,000 and is similar to an equalizer. It is designed to restore tonal balance to a recording by overcoming distortions which may be caused by the recording itself, the listening room or the equipment used to play the recording. Cello attached a silver label to each audio palette stating \u201cCello by Mark Levinson\u201d and issued a promotional brochure entitled \u201cCello by Mark Levinson\u201d. The brochure began with a one page \u201cNote from Mark Levinson\u201d and contained several photographs of Levinson.</p>\n<p id=\"b893-9\">Madrigal opened for business shortly after Cello\u2019s product hit the market. It produced the same products MLAS had made and marketed them as the \u201cMark Levin-son\u201d line.</p>\n<p id=\"b893-10\">On May 15, 1985 Madrigal brought suit in Connecticut state court accusing Cello and Levinson of trademark and trade name infringement in violation of the Lanham Act, 15 U.S.C. \u00a7\u00a7 1114, 1125, common law unfair competition, and violation of Connecticut\u2019s Unfair Trade Practices Act, Conn.Gen.Stats. \u00a7\u00a7 35-1, 35 \u2014 lli(c). Levin-son and Cello removed the case to the United States District Court for the District of Connecticut. In the proceedings that followed, Madrigal did not press its common law or Connecticut state law claims and they did not figure in the district court\u2019s decision. They, accordingly, play no part in this appeal.</p>\n<p id=\"b893-11\">On May 29, 1985 Judge Eginton appointed F. Eugene Davis IV as Special <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"818\">*818</page-number>Master to hear testimony on Madrigal\u2019s claims, stating:</p>\n<blockquote id=\"b894-4\">\u201cI don\u2019t understand anything about the merits of any patent or trademark case. I\u2019m not about to educate myself in that jungle. I appoint routinely Special Masters who know what this is all about ... I would have no confidence in my ability to do any justice in that thicket of patent and trademark, which I never understood when I was trying to practice law, and I wouldn\u2019t begin to understand it now.</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b894-5\">\u201c ... So this Court\u2019s jurisdiction is invoked strictly on the Federal Trademark Act, and that means that it\u2019s got to be trademark issues that this Court would consider, and I\u2019m not about to consider those.</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b894-6\">\u201cSo we\u2019re going to get it into the hands of a Special Master who hopefully will be able to hear you this week so that some proper order can be issued.</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b894-8\"><em>\u201c </em>[Y]ou\u2019re not going to get any expertise from me in [the] field [of trademark law].\u201d<footnotemark>1</footnotemark></blockquote>\n<p id=\"b894-9\">Cello, Madrigal and Levinson did not object to Judge Eginton\u2019s appointment of the Special Master.</p>\n<p id=\"b894-10\">Special Master Davis heard testimony on Madrigal\u2019s claim on May 30 and 31. After hearing evidence of Cello\u2019s use of the \u201cCello by Mark Levinson\u201d brochure and the \u201cCello by Mark Levinson\u201d label on the audio palette, Davis reported to Judge Egin-ton on the afternoon of May 31. He found that \u201cthere is a likelihood of confusion, mistake and deception in the trade by the simultaneous use of Mark Levinson by the two companies; and that, therefore, the use of the defendant is an infringement of the plaintiff\u2019s rights\u201d. Judge Eginton accepted the Special Master\u2019s factual findings and enjoined (i) Cello from using the promotional brochures linking Levinson to Cello; (ii) Cello and Levinson from using the Levinson trademark or trade name, and (iii) Levinson from \u201cattending the International Summer Consumer Electronic Show in Chicago II.\u201d Neither Cello nor Levinson appealed from this order.</p>\n<p id=\"b894-13\">Madrigal, dissatisfied with the injunction, on July 15 requested that it be modified (1) to bar Cello and Levinson from using the name \u201c \u2018Mark Levinson\u2019 ... in connection with any product manufactured or distributed by Cello\u201d or from \u201cissuing press releases or advertising or generating any publicity, oral or written\u201d concerning Lev-inson\u2019s connection with Cello and (2) to require Cello to mail a letter to all recipients of Cello\u2019s publicity brochures indicating that Madrigal owned the Levinson trade name. In August, Madrigal filed a motion accusing Cello and Levinson of contempt for allegedly violating the May injunction. The present record does not reveal what became of the contempt motion, and the matter is not at issue on this appeal.</p>\n<p id=\"b894-14\">The Special Master held hearings on Madrigal\u2019s motions on September 24 and October 2, 1985. Berlin, one other Madrigal executive, and several dealers in audio equipment testified on Madrigal\u2019s behalf. Levinson and personnel from Cello testified for Cello. All the witnesses agreed on several points. First, after the May 1985 injunction, Cello had removed the \u201cCello by Mark Levinson\u201d plate from its products and discontinued use of the enjoined brochures.</p>\n<p id=\"b895-3\"><page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"819\">*819</page-number>Second, the dealers testified, and Levin-son agreed, that after the May injunction he had helped in the marketing of Cello\u2019s audio palette. He testified that he had personally contacted dealers who sold \u201chigh end\u201d audio equipment to encourage them to carry Cello products. He also admitted that he spoke to journalists for two American audio magazines. <em>Audio </em>and <em>The Absolute Sound, </em>and one British journal, the <em>Hi-Fi News, </em>that he had attended a trade show in England and that he had given a \u201cseminar\u201d on Cello for one dealer.</p>\n<p id=\"b895-4\">Third, Berlin and the two dealers, both of whom were called by Madrigal, testified that Madrigal and Cello produced different products. Madrigal was not marketing an \u201caudio palette\u201d or an equalizer. Furthermore, they agreed that the products looked very different and that, since Cello had removed the \u201cCello by Mark Levinson\u201d label from the audio palette after the May injunction, there was little chance that a consumer would think that the products sold by Madrigal and Cello, respectively, were produced by or came from the same source. Both dealers testified that they had explained to their customers that Madrigal owned the Mark Levinson trade name but that Levinson himself was designing products for Cello. Madrigal introduced no evidence that customers purchased, or were in danger of purchasing, Cello products in the belief that they had been produced by Madrigal, or vice versa.</p>\n<p id=\"b895-5\">Berlin, Mark Glazier (the President of Madrigal) and the dealers did testify, however, that Levinson\u2019s connection with Cello might cause \u201cconfusion\u201d in the high-end audio market. It was apparent that they were referring to confusion among dealers as to Levinson\u2019s legal right to help Cello produce and sell audio equipment. Both dealers explained that the \u201cconfusion\u201d they feared would arise if a competing dealer began carrying Cello products and marketing them as the \u201creal\u201d Mark Levinson line. Both admitted, however, that since they were the only dealers carrying both Cello and Madrigal for their respective areas no such problem had arisen. Madrigal introduced no evidence that any Cello dealers were using the marketing ploy feared by the dealers.</p>\n<p id=\"b895-7\">Though there was virtually no evidence that any one was \u201cconfused\u201d as to which company Levinson worked for, or which company produced which product, there was overwhelming evidence that Levinson had a very substantial personal reputation among consumers of high-end audio products as a designer of audio equipment. Robert Goddard, one of the dealers Madrigal called as a witness, explained that he wanted to carry both Cello and Madrigal products because of Levinson\u2019s reputation in the marketplace. He explained:</p>\n<blockquote id=\"b895-8\">\u201cThe high end audio market is driven enormously by personality. It\u2019s true at the manufacturing and design level in terms of high end audio products____ [N]ot a lot of people care who runs Sony, for example, but many people care who runs Mark Levinson, who runs Audio Research, that sort of thing. If Mr. Johnson, for example, were to leave Audio Research, there would be an enormous concern with what he was going to do next. And it would be very questionable whether Audio Research would continue and be significant. And its [sic] important on the sales floor, day in and day out, in terms of the way these products are presented, and I think important in the customers\u2019 minds.\u201d</blockquote>\n<p id=\"b895-11\">A second dealer called by Madrigal, Peter McGrath, made the same point. He explained that if it became known that Levin-son was designing Cello\u2019s products, not Madrigal\u2019s, he would be concerned that he \u201cwould, in fact, have products that bear [Levinson\u2019s] name and not his involvement, and that my competitor has products which don\u2019t bear his name but his involvement.\u201d Any customer buying products of the quality produced by Madrigal or Cello, McGrath continued, would \u201cplace great value\u201d on Levinson\u2019s involvement, not on the fact that a product bore his name.</p>\n<p id=\"b895-12\">Evidence of Levinson\u2019s very substantial personal reputation in the high end audio market was not limited to the testimony of <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"820\">*820</page-number>the dealers. Madrigal\u2019s chief investor, Berlin, admitted that news that Levinson was designing products for Cello, not for Madrigal, \u201cwould destroy [Madrigal\u2019s] distribution in the United Kingdom or virtually destroy it.\u201d An English trade show even advertised itself with the words: \u201cGroupies take notice. Mark Levinson will be at the [show].\u201d</p>\n<p id=\"b896-4\">On October 7, Madrigal filed an \u201cAmended Motion to Modify and Clarify the Injunction\u201d and a brief responding to the \u201cObjections of Mark Levinson.\u201d The new motion sought an injunction barring Levinson from \u201ccommunicating\u201d in any way with dealers, customers or journalists in the high end audio industry and ordering \u201cMark Levin-son, every Tuesday, to file with the court a notarized statement confirming his compliance with the foregoing.\u201d Madrigal also asserted that it had purchased Levinson\u2019s agreement not to compete from MLAS at the bankruptcy auction. Only in the course of argument did it contend that the Levin-son case was similar to a Second Circuit decision, <em>Levitt Corp. v. Levitt, </em>593 F.2d 463 (1979), in which sweeping injunctive relief had been granted against an individual who attempted to use his personal name in connection with his business after selling the right to use the name as a trademark or trade name.</p>\n<p id=\"b896-5\">On December 30, 1985, the Special Master submitted a written report to Judge Eginton on the motion to modify the preliminary injunction. The report asserted that there was confusion among ultimate consumers of audio products as to whether Madrigal\u2019s or Cello\u2019s products \u201cemanate from Mark Levinson\u201d and that Cello was \u201cliterally doing business as Mark Levin-son\u2019s company.\u201d The Special Master, relying heavily on our decision in <em>Levitt, supra, </em>therefore concluded that Cello and Levinson\u2019s conduct violated Madrigal\u2019s right to the Levinson trade name and trademark and recommended that Levinson and Cello be barred from publicizing Levinson\u2019s connection with Cello.</p>\n<p id=\"b896-6\">Judge Eginton accepted the Special Master\u2019s recommendations on February 24, 1986 and modified the May injunction accordingly. As modified the injunction (i) barred Cello and Levinson \u201cuntil further ord\u00e9r of the court, from generating any publicity, oral or written, from issuing any press releases or advertising, and from communicating in any manner with any dealer or distributor of audio or hi-fidelity equipment, throughout the world, about the defendant Mark Levinson\u2019s connection with Cello, Ltd.\u201d or past connection with MLAS; (ii) barred Levinson from serving as Cello\u2019s sales representative; and (iii) ordered Cello to notify all who had received its promotional brochures mentioning Mark Levinson that those brochures infringed Madrigal\u2019s right to the Levinson trademark and trade name.</p>\n<p id=\"b896-8\">Cello and Levinson appeal from the district court\u2019s order as a violation of their rights. Madrigal cross-appeals from the order as insufficient.</p>\n<p id=\"b896-9\">DISCUSSION</p>\n<p id=\"b896-10\">Madrigal\u2019s Cross-Appeal: Should the District Court have Enjoined Levinson from Violating the Agreement Not to Compete?</p>\n<p id=\"b896-11\">Madrigal\u2019s argument that Judge Eginton should have enjoined Levinson from violating the agreement not to compete which Madrigal claims to have with Levinson merits little attention. Madrigal never requested any such injunction in the lower court. Its mere reference to the agreement in its brief submitted to the Special Master on October 7, 1985, hardly constituted a motion to enforce the agreement not to compete. It simply mentioned the agreement in an effort to analogize Levin-son\u2019s conduct to that enjoined by this court in <em>Levitt, supra. </em>It did not ask that the agreement not to compete be enforced.</p>\n<p id=\"b896-12\">A party \u201cmay not raise claims on appeal which it failed to raise before the trial court\u201d unless \u201cmanifest injustice\u201d will result. <em>Schmidt v. Polish People\u2019s Republic, </em>742 F.2d 67, 70 (2d Cir.1984). <em>See also Air et Chaleur, S.A. v. Janeway, </em>757 F.2d 489, 493 (2d Cir.1985); <em>Terkildsen v. Wa</em><page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"821\">*821</page-number><em>ters, </em>481 F.2d 201, 204 (2d Cir.1973). Madrigal\u2019s cross-appeal implicates \u201cfactual questions ... as to which the judge made no findings because the issue was not directly raised\u201d. It further raises a \u201csubtle legal issue\u201d which \u201ccould have been exposed and distilled by the ... district court so as to facilitate ... consideration of this court.\u201d <em>Id. </em>at 204-05. It must therefore be dismissed.</p>\n<p id=\"b897-4\">The factual question raised by the cross-appeal is whether Madrigal has any right to enforce Levinson\u2019s agreement with MLAS not to compete against MLAS. That agreement is not among the properties listed in the Bankruptcy Trustee\u2019s \u201cNotice of Sale of Debtor\u2019s Property\u201d or in the \u201cBill of Sale\u201d. Nor is there any evidence that Madrigal purchased the agreement not to compete against MLAS. Indeed, there is some evidence that the agreement was not among the assets auctioned off. Madrigal\u2019s delay in raising the enforceability of the agreement not to compete, when it was aware of the agreement\u2019s existence, suggests that its present belated claim is a weak one at best.</p>\n<p id=\"b897-5\">Furthermore, it is uncertain whether the agreement with MLAS would be legally enforceable by Madrigal. It is true that Connecticut adheres to the view, rejected in most jurisdictions, <em>see </em>2 Callmann, <em>Unfair Competition, Trademarks &amp; Monopolies, </em>\u00a7 16.15 at 62 (4th ed. 1983, 1986 Supp.); Comment, \u201cAssignability of Employees\u2019 Covenants Not to Compete,\u201d 19 U.Chi.L.R. 97, 106 (1951), that an employee\u2019s covenant not to compete is an assignable asset of the employer, <em>Torrington Creamery Inc. v. Davenport, </em>126 Conn. 515, 12 A.2d 780, 783 (1940). However, that state also requires that the agreement \u201cbe partial or restrictive in its operation in respect either to time or place, be on some good consideration and ... be reasonable \u2014 that is, it should afford only a fair protection to the interest of the party in whose favor it is made and must not be so large in its operation as to interfere with the interests of the public.\u201d <em>Id., </em>12 A.2d at 783. <em>See also Scott v. General Iron &amp; Welding Co., </em>171 Conn. 132, 368 A.2d 111, 115 (1976); <em>Mattis v. Lally, </em>138 Conn. 51, 52, 82 A.2d 155 (1951); <em>Timenterial Inc. v. Dagata, </em>29 Conn.Sup. 180, 277 A.2d 512, 513 (1971); <em>Welles v. O\u2019Connell, </em>23 Conn.Sup. 335, 183 A.2d 287, 288 (1962). Upon the present record Levinson could argue, with some force, that the agreement not to compete, because of its worldwide reach and the minimal consideration Levinson received for it, fails to satisfy those requirements.</p>\n<p id=\"A6bp\">\n<em>The Appeal by Cello and Levinson</em>\n</p>\n<p id=\"b897-8\">Initially, Cello and Levinson claim that the injunction is void because the case was improperly submitted to a Special Master. However, neither party made that argument before the district court, either before or after the submission of the case to the Special Master, and they therefore may not raise it for the first time here. <em>Hayes v. Foodmaker, Inc., </em>634 F.2d 802, 803 (5th Cir.1981); <em>Cruz v. Hauck, </em>515 F.2d 322, 330-31 (5th Cir.1975).<footnotemark>2</footnotemark></p>\n<p id=\"b897-9\">Th\u00e9 determinative issue on the appeal of Cello and Levinson is whether an individual who sold the right to use his personal name as a trade name may be enjoined from advertising the fact that he is now connected with a company competing against the purchaser of the trade name. On this issue Madrigal, in seeking a preliminary injunction, assumed \u201cthe burden of showing irreparable harm <em>and </em>(1) either probable success on the merits <em>or </em>(2) sufficiently serious questions going to the merits to make them a fair ground for litigation <em>plus </em>a <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"822\">*822</page-number>balance of hardships tipping decidedly in the plaintiff\u2019s favor.\u201d <em>Texaco, Inc. v.

The injunction cannot, however, be justified as protection for Madrigal\u2019s interest in the Levinson <em>trademark, </em>which is a word, name, symbol or device \u201cadopted and used by a manufacturer or merchant to identify his goods and distinguish them from those manufactured or sold by others.\u201d 11 U.S.C. \u00a7 1127. <em>See also </em>3 Callmann, <em>supra, </em>\u00a7 17.05. A preliminary injunction barring a party from using a mark or symbol similar to a registered trademark may be issued only when \u201cthere is any likelihood that an appreciable number of ordinarily prudent purchasers are likely to be misled, or indeed simply confused, as to the source of the goods in question.\u201d <em>Joseph Scott Co. v. Scott Swimming Pools, Inc., </em>764 F.2d 62, 66 (2d Cir.1985) (quoting <em>McGregor-Doniger, Inc. v. Drizzle Inc., </em>599 F.2d 1126, 1130 (2d Cir.1979)); <em>Mushroom Makers, Inc. v. R.G.

Such a showing satisfies a trademark holder\u2019s burden, when seeking a preliminary injunction, of establishing both likelihood that he will succeed on the merits and that he will suffer irreparable harm if an injunction is not granted. <em>Standard &amp; Poor\u2019s Corp.

Bully Hill Vineyards, Inc., </em>569 F.2d 731, 733 at n. 1 (2d Cir.1978).</p>\n<p id=\"b898-7\">No such showing was made here. Although Cello had used the phrase \u201cby Mark Levinson\u201d on its products and brochures prior to May 1985, there is <em>no </em>evidence that after the district court\u2019s May 31, 1985, injunction it applied any type of mark to its products that would lead a consumer to mistake the item for Madrigal\u2019s. To the contrary, all witnesses agreed that the equipment produced by each company was distinct. Indeed, Madrigal now explicitly concedes that the district court\u2019s later 1986 injunction cannot be justified as necessary to protect Madrigal\u2019s \u201cMark Levinson\u201d trademark. It argues, however, that that injunction was necessary to protect Madrigal\u2019s right to the \u201cMark Levinson\u201d <em>trade name. </em>We disagree.</p>\n<p id=\"b898-9\">Just as trademarks identify a product, trade names are \u201cused by manufacturers ... and others to <em>identify their business \u201d </em>15 U.S.C. \u00a7 1127 (emphasis added). <em>See also </em>3 Callmann, <em>supra </em>\u00a7 17.05.

But even when a personal name has become a trade name it continues to serve the important function to its bearer of acting as a symbol of that individual\u2019s personality, reputation and accomplishments as distinguished from that of the business, corporation or otherwise, with which he has been associated. 3 Callmann, <em>supra, </em>at \u00a7 17.06. Accordingly, though an individual may sell the right to use his personal name, <em>Levitt, supra; Guth v. Guth Chocolate Co., </em>224 F. 932, 933-34 (4th Cir.1915); <em>The Lepage Co. v. Russia Cement Co., </em>51 F. 941, 943 (1st Cir.1892), a court will not bar him from using that name unless his \u201cintention to convey an exclusive right to the use of [his] own name\u201d is \u201cclearly shown.\u201d <em>Guth Chocolate Co. v.

When an individual sells no more than the right to use his name as a trade name or trademark he is precluded only from using his personal name as part of that of another company or on other products, <em>Levitt, supra, </em>593 F.2d at 468; <em>Taylor Wine Co. v. Bully Hill Vineyards, Inc., </em>569 F.2d 731, 735 (2d Cir.1978), and not from taking advantage of his individual reputation (as opposed to the reputation of the company which bore his personal name as a trade name) by establishing a company which competes against the purchaser of the trade name, 3 Callmann, <em>supra, </em>\u00a7 19.60 at 236; <em>see also Guth Chocolate Co., supra, </em>215 F. at 767, 772; <em>The Lepage Co., supra, </em>51 F. at 944-46, or from advertising, in a not overly intrusive manner, that he is affiliated with a new company. 3 Callmann, <em>supra, </em>\u00a7 19.60 at 236. <em>See also Guth Chocolate Co., supra, </em>215 F. at 767; <em>Auto Hearse Mfg. Co. v. Bateman, </em>109 A. 735, 736 (N.J.Ch. 1920).</p>\n<p id=\"b899-5\">In the present case, Levinson sold MLAS the right to \u201cuse\u201d the Levinson trade name and defined \u201cuse\u201d to be \u201cuse ... (a) as part of a name of a corporation, partnership, joint venture, proprietorship, firm or business or (b) as the name, symbol or identification of any product.\u201d By its terms, therefore, the sale of the trade name did not preclude Levinson from engaging in the audio business through a company other than Madrigal or from advertising his affiliation with such a company. In short, he did not sell or forfeit his right to use his own personal name as long as he did not use it as the trade name of another business.</p>\n<p id=\"b899-8\">Madrigal does not seriously contend that the sale of the trade name, in and of itself, bars Levinson from informing the public that he is now designing audio equipment for Cello.<footnotemark>3</footnotemark> Rather, it argues that the advertisement of Levinson\u2019s affiliation with Cello infringes on Madrigal\u2019s right to the Levinson trade name by presenting Cello to consumers as \u201cthe Mark Levinson Company\u201d and the true successor to MLAS. It is true that an individual who sells a trade name may not thereafter falsely designate the origin of newly-produced products by using his name in such a way as to mislead the public into believing that those products are produced by the company which purchased the trade name. Such \u201cfalse designation of origin\u201d is impermissible. <em>Vibrant Sales, supra, </em>652 F.2d at 303; <em>Levitt, supra, </em>593 F.2d at 468; <em>Guth Chocolate Co., supra, </em>215 F. at 762. Moreover, when accusing the trade name seller of this offense, the trade name purchaser need not \u201cprove that the buying public was actually deceived ... only a likelihood of confusion or deception need be shown in order to obtain equitable relief.\u201d <em>Warner Bros., Inc. v. Gay Toys, Inc., </em>658 F.2d 76, 79 (2d Cir.1981) (cites omitted). <em>See also Dallas Cowboys, Etc. v. Pussycat Cinema, Ltd., </em>604 F.2d 200, 204 (2d Cir.1979).</p>\n<p id=\"b899-9\">The record here, however, fails to support a \u201cfalse designation of origin\u201d theory. On the contrary, there is no evidence that Cello and Levinson\u2019s conduct after the May, 1985 injunction was likely to confuse consumers as to the origin of Cello\u2019s products. All witnesses agreed that the products sold respectively by Madrigal and Cello did not appear to come from the same source. Each of the dealers who testified for Madrigal made it clear that Levinson, in <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"824\">*824</page-number>his dealings with them, explained that Cello and Madrigal were different companies and that he worked for the former. The dealers also testified that they made the same point to their customers. None of Madrigal\u2019s witnesses testified that customers might be confused by Cello's conduct. The confusion to which they referred was over whether Levinson had the legal right to work for Cello or what might happen if a Cello dealer began marketing the audio-palette as part of the \u201creal\u201d Mark Levinson line. However, none of the witnesses suggested that any such dealer existed or that Cello had ever used such a marketing technique. Accordingly, the evidence was totally insufficient to \u201ccreate a fair ground for litigation\u201d over whether consumers were likely to mistake Cello for Madrigal.<footnotemark>4</footnotemark></p>\n<p id=\"b900-4\">The second theory relied upon by the Special Master, impermissible \u201carrogation of goodwill\u201d, <em>see Levitt, supra, </em>is likewise inapplicable to this case. It is, of course, an accepted principle that when a business purchases a trade name the essence of what it pays for is the goodwill associated with that trade name. <em>Levitt, supra, </em>593 F.2d at 468. <em>See generally, </em>Greenfield, \u201cGood Will as a Factor in Trademark Assignments \u2014 A Comparative Study,\u201d 60 TMR 173 (1970). To be protectible, the trade name must have acquired a \u201csecondary meaning\u201d which represents to consumers the past accomplishments, special experience, and particular skills of the business with which it is connected, <em>Levitt, supra, </em>593 F.2d at 468, and therefore the \u201cgoodwill\u201d which consumers have toward that business. <em>See, e.g., Menendez v. Holt, </em>128 U.S. 514, 522, 9 S.Ct. 143, 144, 32 L.Ed. 526 (1888) (goodwill means \u201cevery positive advantage that has been acquired by the old firm in the progress of its business\u201d); <em>Levitt, supra, </em>593 F.2d at 468 (when business purchases trademark it purchases right to inform public that it owns special skill of the business which originally held the trade name); Greenfield, \u201cGood will as a Factor in Trademark Assignments \u2014 A Comparative Study,\u201d 60 TMR 173, 173-75 (1970) (Anglo-American courts define goodwill in terms of business reputation). Since it is the \u201csecondary meaning\u201d that is protected against infringement, the degree of protection afforded a trade name depends upon the \u201cstrength\u201d of its secondary meaning. <em>Amstar Corp. v. Domino\u2019s Pizza, Inc., </em>615 F.2d 252, 259 (5th Cir.), <em>rehearing denied, </em>617 F.2d 295 (5th Cir.1980), <em>cert. denied, </em>449 U.S. 899, 101 S.Ct. 268, 66 L.Ed.2d 129 (1981); <em>J.B. Williams Co., Inc. v. Le Conte Cosmetics, Inc., </em>523 F.2d 187, 192 (9th Cir.1975); 3A Callmann, <em>supra, </em>at \u00a7 20.43; Lunsford, \u201cTrademark Basics,\u201d 59 TMR 873, 878 (1969). <em>Cf. Joseph Scott Co. v. Scott Swimming Pools, Inc., </em>764 F.2d 62, 67 (2d Cir.1985) (scope of injunction in trademark infringement determined by trademark holders\u2019 property interest in mark).</p>\n<p id=\"b900-7\">The value of a trade name, and therefore of the goodwill it represents, is diluted if another business, by adopting a name similar to the trade name, causes confusion \u201cin the mind of the public over the source of the reputable goods or services.\u201d <em>Levitt, supra, </em>593 F.2d at 468. Similarly, an individual may not \u201ckeep for himself the essential thing he sold, and also keep the price he got for it\u201d, <em>id.; Guth v. Guth Chocolate Co., supra, </em>224 F. at 934, by selling the right to use his personal name as a trade name, then advertising his connection with another company in such a way as to arrogate \u201cto himself the trade reputation for which he received valuable consideration,\u201d <em>Levitt, supra, </em>593 F.2d at 468.</p>\n<p id=\"b901-3\"><page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"825\">*825</page-number>Applying these fundamental principles here, it is clear that Madrigal at most acquired such goodwill as was associated with the use of the trade name \u201cLevinson\u201d by MLAS and not the right to use Levin-son\u2019s personal name as a symbol of his individual reputation.<footnotemark>5</footnotemark> The record, moreover, reveals that the secondary meaning attached to the trade name was weak, that there was little business goodwill associated with its use by MLAS, who purchased it from Levinson for a token amount, and that it therefore merited little protection. The real value in the \u201cLevinson\u201d name lay in Mark Levinson\u2019s very substantial individual reputation. Madrigal\u2019s own witnesses admitted that the \u201chigh-end\u201d audio business, especially companies such as MLAS, is \u201cdriven\u201d by personality, that Madrigal\u2019s sales would plummet if the consumers knew Levinson was no longer designing its products and that consumers looked for Levinson's \u201cinvolvement\u201d with a product rather than for his name on its label.</p>\n<p id=\"b901-4\">Nor is there any evidence that after the 1985 injunction Levinson arrogated to himself the value of the goodwill sold to Madrigal. Madrigal\u2019s dealers testified that Lev-inson\u2019s sales pitch to them and their customers focused on the quality of the audio palette and on Levinson\u2019s own individual reputation. There was virtually no evidence that Levinson was attempting to boost Cello\u2019s sales or increase his own reputation by reference to his past ties to MLAS. Levinson did admit that he told a \u201cseminar\u201d of customers that he had been associated with MLAS. There was no evidence, however, that he went beyond that simple factual statement or in any way attributed MLAS\u2019 past success to his own activities. Madrigal also introduced an article from the small audio magazine, <em>High Performance, </em>which closed with the statement that Levinson had said that \u201cCello Ltd. would produce [audio-equipment] in the Mark Levinson tradition.\u201d Though Levinson\u2019s comment, if quoted correctly, could arguably have been improper, it, in isolation, is not evidence enough to suggest that Levinson must be enjoined from \u201ckeeping for himself\u201d the goodwill he sold with the Levinson trade name.</p>\n<p id=\"b901-6\">Madrigal has failed to \u201craise a fair ground for litigation\u201d on its claim that the conduct of Levinson and Cello after the May 31, 1985 injunction violated Madrigal\u2019s trade name and trademark rights and must, therefore, be enjoined. Accordingly, we reverse in their entirety the February 1986 modifications to the 1985 injunction.<footnotemark>6</footnotemark></p>\n<footnote label=\"1\">\n<p id=\"b894-11\">. We must express our firm disagreement with the district judge\u2019s concept of his duties. Having by his oath of office accepted the task of adjudicating all issues falling within the court\u2019s federal jurisdiction, he is obligated, whenever faced with unfamiliar factual or legal issues (including those involving trademark and copyright matters), to educate himself in those fields with the aid of counsel, colleagues on the bench, law clerks, and published texts and decisions. This has been the path traditionally followed by respected members of the federal judiciary. See, e.g., Medina, \"A New Judge Tries His First Patent Case,\u201d 34 Cornell L.Q. 220 (1949); Rif-kind, \"The Romance Discoverable in Patent Cases,\u201d 16 F.R.D. 253. Resort to a Special Master is permissible only when \"some exceptional condition requires it.\" Fed.R.Civ.P. 53(b). No such circumstance or condition existed here.</p>\n</footnote>\n<footnote label=\"2\">\n<p id=\"b897-6\">. Had Cello and Levinson made a timely objection, Judge Eginton\u2019s decision to submit the case to a Special Master might well have called for a reversal on the ground that he had exceeded his powers. See footnote 1, <em>supra. </em>The present case would not satisfy the requirement that \u201cexceptional circumstances\u201d permitting such reference first be found. <em>Bradshaw </em>v. <em>Thompson, </em>454 F.2d 75, 80 (6th Cir.), <em>cert. denied, </em>409 U.S. 878 (1972); <em>Wilver v. Fisher, </em>387 F.2d 66, 69 (10th Cir.1967). \u201c[T]he fact that \u2018the case involves complex issues of fact and law is no justification for reference to a Master, but rather is a [com]pelling reason for trial before an experienced judge.\u2019 \u201d <em>Moore, supra, </em>454 F.2d at 80 (quoting <em>Bartlett-Collins Co. v. Surinam Nav. Co., </em>381 F.2d 546, 551 (10th Cir.1967).</p>\n</footnote>\n<footnote label=\"3\">\n<p id=\"b899-6\">. Madrigal suggests that Levinson\u2019s contract with MLAS incorporated an agreement not to compete. But, as we have noted, there is substantial doubt whether Madrigal, as the purchaser of various MLAS assets, has any right to that agreement and whether the agreement is enforceable if it does. In any event Madrigal did not argue below that it held any right to that agreement and the district court issued the injunction based solely on the Special Master\u2019s finding of trade name and trademark infringement. The crucial point, therefore, is that, when selling the right to use his name as a trade name, Levinson only sold the right to use \u201cLev-inson\u201d in the name of a business or of a product.</p>\n</footnote>\n<footnote label=\"4\">\n<p id=\"b900-5\">. The paucity of evidence supporting Madrigal\u2019s \u201cconfusion\" claim is illustrated by the fact that Madrigal, on appeal, repeatedly quotes a passage from an article which appeared in the small West-Coast audio magazine, <em>High Performance. </em>Madrigal claims that the article\u2019s statement, \u201cMark Levinson, the person, announced to us ... that his Cello, Ltd. would produce ... components in the Mark Levinson tradition\u201d, demonstrates that confusion existed. Read as a whole, however, the article demonstrates the opposite. The sentence Madrigal relies on is the very last in the article, and appears in parentheses. The import of the article, and the point it made in its opening paragraph, is that Madrigal had purchased MLAS\u2019 assets, including the \u201cLevinson\u201d trademark, and was producing \u201cMark Levinson audio products\u201d in MLAS\u2019 old factory.</p>\n</footnote>\n<footnote label=\"5\">\n<p id=\"b901-18\">. Indeed, it is unclear that Levinson could have sold his personal name after becoming associated with Cello. Levinson held a reputation for skill as a designer of audio products. Madrigal might commit a fraud of sorts on the public if it represented itself as possessing Levinson\u2019s personal skill when that skill was, in fact, dedicated to Cello. 3 Callmann, <em>supra, </em>at \u00a7 19.60.</p>\n</footnote>\n<footnote label=\"6\">\n<p id=\"b901-20\">.
