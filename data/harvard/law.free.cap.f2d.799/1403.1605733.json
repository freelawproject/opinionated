Cotton contends that: (1) the Administrative Law Judge (\u201cAU\u201d) erred in his consideration of her subjective complaints; (2) substantial evidence does not support the AU\u2019s decision that she has the residual functional capacity to perform a wide range of light work; (3) the AU erred in his consideration of a treating physician\u2019s evidence; (4) the ALJ erred in applying the medical-vocational guidelines (\u201cthe grids\u201d); and (5) the district court erred by refusing to remand for consideration of new evidence.</p>\n<p id=\"b1457-13\">We have jurisdiction pursuant to 28 U.S.C. \u00a7 1291 and 42 U.S.C. \u00a7 405(g). We reverse the Secretary\u2019s decision and remand for further findings.</p>\n<p id=\"b1457-16\">BACKGROUND</p>\n<p id=\"b1457-17\">Clementine Cotton applied for disability insurance benefits and supplemental security income in June 1982. She claimed to be disabled since October 31, 1981, because of a broken left ankle, gout, and arthritis. Her applications were denied initially and on reconsideration. After a hearing, an AU determined that Cotton was not disabled. He found that, although Cotton was unable to perform her past work, she retained the residual functional capacity to perform a wide range of light work. The district court affirmed the Secretary\u2019s decision, and Cotton filed a timely appeal. DISCUSSION</p>\n<p id=\"b1457-18\">To qualify for disability benefits, the claimant must establish that a medically determinable physical or mental impairment prevents her from engaging in substantial gainful activity and that the impairment is expected to result in death or to last for a continuous period of at least 12 months. 42 U.S.C. \u00a7 423(d)(1)(A); <em>Jones v. Heckler, </em>760 F.2d 993, 995 (9th Cir.1985); <em>Gallant v. Heckler, </em>753 F.2d 1450, 1452 (9th Cir.1984). Additionally, the impairment must result from anatomical, physiological, or psychological abnormalities that are demonstrable by medically acceptable clinical or laboratory diagnostic techniques. 42 U.S.C. \u00a7 423(d)(3); <em>Gallant, </em>753 F.2d at 1452.</p>\n<p id=\"b1457-19\">The claimant has the burden of proving that she is disabled. <em>Swanson v. Secretary of Health &amp; Human Services, </em>763 F.2d 1061, 1064 (9th Cir.1985); <em>Gallant, </em>753 F.2d at 1452. The claimant establishes a prima facie case of disability by showing that her impairment prevents her from performing her previous occupation. <em>Gallant, </em>753 F.2d at 1452. The burden then shifts to the Secretary to show that the claimant can perform other types of work that exist in the national economy, given her residual functional capacity,<footnotemark>1</footnotemark> age, education, and work experience. <em>Id.; </em>20 C.F.R. \u00a7\u00a7 404.1505(a); 404.1520(f); 404.1560.1568 (1986).</p>\n<p id=\"b1458-3\"><page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"1406\">*1406</page-number>The Secretary\u2019s decision denying benefits will be disturbed only if it is not supported by substantial evidence or if it is based on legal error. 42 U.S.C. \u00a7 405(g); <em>Nyman v. Heckler, </em>779 F.2d 528, 530 (9th Cir.1985).</p>\n<p id=\"b1458-4\">I</p>\n<p id=\"b1458-5\">Consideration of Subjective Complaints</p>\n<p id=\"b1458-6\">A. Claimant\u2019s Testimony</p>\n<p id=\"b1458-7\">Cotton was 48 years old at the time of the hearing. She has a ninth-grade education and has worked primarily as a maid and a cook. She fractured her left foot and ankle when she fell off a cable car in September 1981. She testified that she experiences severe pain in her leg when she stands or walks. She also suffers severe constant lower back pain. Cotton testified that her pain restricts her usual daily activities. She cannot sweep, vacuum or mop because of her back pain. She has to sit on a chair to reach low objects, because bending over is too painful. She cannot push a grocery cart or carry more than one five-pound bag of groceries.</p>\n<p id=\"b1458-8\">B. Medical Evidence</p>\n<p id=\"b1458-9\">Dr. McChesney treated Cotton for post-traumatic arthritis in her left ankle following the September 1981 accident. In a July 1982 progress note, Dr. McChesney stated that \u201csome degree [of] pain and swelling remains in left ankle.\u201d He concluded that Cotton\u2019s ankle \u201cdoes limit her activities and ability to perform her usual occupation.\u201d</p>\n<p id=\"AQ1t\">An August 1982 musculoskeletal examination by Dr. Stroot revealed muscle weakness and atrophy in the lower left leg. Dr. Stroot noted pain and swelling in the left ankle.</p>\n<p id=\"b1458-10\">A September 1982 report by Dr. Cohen noted that although Cotton said \u201cthat she could only raise her leg a few inches off the floor,\u201d she \u201cdenies any difficulty walking, climbing stairs, getting out of chairs, or doing any daily activities.\u201d Dr. Cohen found:</p>\n<blockquote id=\"b1458-12\">There is a diffuse weakness of the left leg, both proximal and distal, with a give-way quality; this is evident on direct manual testing. However, functional testing reveals the strength in the left leg to be entirely intact. The patient is able to move around in bed and get out of chairs without any difficulty, at which time she is able to lift her leg very well. She is able to do deep knee bends without any problems. Gait is quite normal except for an occasional limp, and heel walk is done quite well.</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b1458-13\">I am unable to detect any organic neurological problem at the present time____ I believe her primary problem is pain, which may well limit her activities. The etiology of this is obscure to me, but does not seem to be neuropathic in nature.</blockquote>\n<p id=\"b1458-15\">In an October 1982 letter to Cotton, Dr. Cohen stated: \u201cYou appear to be in great discomfort from the pain, and are thus unable to work.\u201d In a November 1982 office note, Dr. Cohen stated that Cotton found that \u201cthe transcutaneous nerve stimulator is working very well and her ankle pain is now quite bearable.\u201d <footnotemark>2</footnotemark> An examination was \u201cagain within normal limits\u201d and he could \u201cnot detect any clear weakness.\u201d</p>\n<p id=\"b1458-16\">Dr. Sciaroni began treating Cotton in February 1983 \u201cfor chronic, intractable, low back and left lower extremity pain and complaints of left lower extremity weakness and numbness.\u201d Although a lumbar CT scan was normal, a bone scan \u201crevealed irregularly increased uptake throughout the entire lumbar spine.\u201d Dr. Chin, who did the bone scan, noted that \u201c[t]he changes in the lumbar spine would be compatible with a degenerative process.\u201d Dr. Sciaroni concluded that Cotton had lumbar spinal osteoarthritis, causing an inability to \u201cweight bear for over 30 minutes or sit for over 30 minutes.\u201d Dr. Sciaroni stated that Cotton \u201cis totally and permanently dis<page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"1407\">*1407</page-number>abled\u201d and he expected her symptoms to worsen with the passage of time.</p>\n<p id=\"b1459-5\">C. AU\u2019s Report</p>\n<p id=\"b1459-6\">The AU found that Cotton was impaired by left ankle arthritis and left leg weakness, but concluded that the symptoms and limitations she described were disproportionate to the objective medical evidence. The AU found that although Cotton could no longer work as a cook or a maid,<footnotemark>3</footnotemark> she had the residual functional capacity to perform a wide range of light work. Applying the grids, the AU determined that Cotton was not disabled.</p>\n<p id=\"b1459-7\">D. Consideration of Excess Pain</p>\n<p id=\"b1459-8\">The Secretary is not required to believe a claimant\u2019s pain testimony, and the Secretary may decide to disregard such testimony entirely whenever the claimant fails to submit objective medical findings establishing a medical impairment that could reasonably be expected to produce the claimed pain. 42 U.S.C. \u00a7 423(d)(5)(A);<footnotemark>4</footnotemark> <em>Taylor v. Heckler, </em>765 F.2d 872, 876 (9th Cir.1985). If the claimant submits objective medical findings establishing a medical impairment that would normally produce a certain amount of pain, but testifies that she experiences pain at a higher level (hereinafter referred to as the claimant\u2019s \u201cexcess pain\u201d), the Secretary is free to decide to disbelieve that testimony, <em>Nyman, </em>779 F.2d at 531, but must make specific findings justifying that decision, <em>Miller v. Heckler, </em>770 F.2d 845, 848 (9th Cir.1985); <em>Bellamy v. Secretary of Health and Human Services, </em>755 F.2d 1380, 1382 (9th Cir.1985).</p>\n<p id=\"b1459-9\">\u201cExcess pain\u201d is, by definition, pain that is unsupported by objective medical findings. If the Secretary were free to disbelieve excess-pain testimony solely on the ground that it was not supported by objective medical findings, then the Secretary would be free to reject all excess-pain testimony. This court has rejected that interpretation of \u00a7 423(d)(5)(A). \u201c[W]e have never required that the medical evidence identify an impairment that would make the pain inevitable.\u201d <em>Howard v. Heckler, </em>782 F.2d 1484, 1488 (9th Cir.1986). Requiring full objective confirmation of pain complaints before believing them \u201cwould overlook the fact that pain is a highly idiosyncratic phenomenon, varying according to the pain threshold and stamina of the individual victim,\u201d and it would trivialize the importance that we have consistently ascribed to pain testimony, rendering it, in the final analysis, almost superfluous. <em>Id. </em>In enacting the Social Security Disability Reform Act, Congress did not intend to render the claimant\u2019s pain testimony irrelevant. \u201cInstead, Congress clearly meant that so long as the pain is <em>associated </em>with a clinically demonstrated impairment, credible pain testimony should contribute to a determination of disability.\u201d <em>Id. </em>at 1488 n. 4.</p>\n<p id=\"b1459-14\">Thus it is improper as a matter of law for an AU to discredit excess pain testimony solely on the ground that it is not fully corroborated by objective medical findings. Yet this is what the AU appears to have done in this case. We therefore reverse and remand with instructions that the Secretary make proper findings regarding Cotton\u2019s allegations of disabling pain.</p>\n<p id=\"b1459-15\">The record contains objective medical, clinical and laboratory evidence that Cotton suffered physical conditions that could reasonably be expected to produce some degree of pain and limitation. Dr. McChes-ney diagnosed post-traumatic arthritis of the ankle. Dr. Stroot found muscle weakness and atrophy in the lower leg. Dr. Cohen found diffuse leg weakness on man<page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"1408\">*1408</page-number>ual testing. Dr. Sciaroni diagnosed lumbar spinal osteoarthritis. A bone scan revealed lumbar spine changes compatible with a degenerative process. Yet the only reason given by the AU for finding Cotton not disabled was that her subjective complaints were disproportionate to the medical evidence. This constitutes legal error and requires reversal.<footnotemark>5</footnotemark></p>\n<p id=\"b1460-4\">II</p>\n<p id=\"b1460-5\">Treating Physician\u2019s Evidence</p>\n<p id=\"ATPy\">Cotton contends that the AU erred in disregarding Dr. Sciaroni\u2019s evidence about her back problems. This contention has merit and constitutes an independent ground requiring reversal of this case and a remand for further findings by the Secretary.</p>\n<p id=\"b1460-6\">If the AU chooses to disregard uncontroverted medical evidence, he must set forth clear and convincing specific reasons for doing so. <em>Day v. Weinberger, </em>522 F.2d 1154, 1156 (9th Cir.1975). If the ALJ chooses to disregard a treating physician\u2019s medical opinion, he must set forth specific, legitimate reasons for doing so, and this decision must itself be based on substantial evidence. <em>Jones v. Heckler, </em>760 F.2d 993, 995, 997 (9th Cir.1985); <em>Murray v. Heckler, </em>722 F.2d 499, 501-02 (9th Cir.1983). The AU can meet this burden by setting out a detailed and thorough summary of the facts and conflicting clinical evidence, stating his interpretation thereof, and making findings. <em>Swanson v. Secretary, </em>763 F.2d 1061, 1065 (9th Cir.1985).</p>\n<p id=\"b1460-7\">Dr. Sciaroni had been treating Cotton for four months for lumbar spinal osteoarthritis. This diagnosis was at least partially confirmed by a bone scan. Dr. Sciaroni stated that due to the \u201cconstancy and severity of her symptoms [Cotton] cannot weight bear for over 30 minutes or sit for over 30 minutes.\u201d Sciaroni concluded that Cotton was \u201ctotally and permanently disabled.\u201d</p>\n<p id=\"b1460-10\">Although the AU recited this evidence in the discussion portion of his decision, he failed to find that Cotton suffered any impairment connected to her back.<footnotemark>6</footnotemark> The only reason given by the ALJ for disregarding Dr. Sciaroni\u2019s evidence was that \u201ca statement made by the claimant\u2019s physician does not mean that the Administration will determine that the claimant is disabled.\u201d</p>\n<p id=\"b1460-11\">While it is true that the Secretary is not obligated to award disability solely on the basis of a treating physician\u2019s conclusion, 20 C.F.R. \u00a7 404.1527 (1986), the Secretary must provide a reasoned rationale for disregarding a particular treating physician\u2019s findings. Even if Dr. Sciaroni\u2019s evidence was controverted, the AU had to provide at least \u201cspecific, legitimate reasons\u201d for rejecting it. <em>Jones, </em>760 F.2d at 995; <em>Murray, </em>722 F.2d at 501-02. And even if the ALJ reasonably disregarded Dr. Sciaroni\u2019s conclusion that Cotton was disabled, the AU was still required to provide reasons for disregarding Dr. Sciaroni\u2019s diagnosis of lumbar spinal osteoarthritis.</p>\n<p id=\"b1460-12\">The AU\u2019s findings completely disregarded Dr. Sciaroni\u2019s medical findings: the AU acknowledged Cotton\u2019s leg and ankle problems, but ignored her back problems. The AU did not give any reason for doing this, and thereby committed legal error. Therefore, on remand of this case, <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"1409\">*1409</page-number>the Secretary must give proper consideration to Dr. Sciaroni\u2019s evidence.</p>\n<p id=\"b1461-4\">Ill</p>\n<p id=\"b1461-5\">New Evidence</p>\n<p id=\"b1461-6\">Cotton contends that the district court erred by refusing to consider new evidence. This contention lacks merit.</p>\n<p id=\"b1461-7\">A reviewing court may remand a case to the Secretary for consideration of new evidence where: (1) the new evidence is material; and (2) good cause exists for the claimant\u2019s failure to incorporate the evidence in a prior proceeding. 42 U.S.C. \u00a7 405(g); <em>Key v. Heckler, </em>754 F.2d 1545, 1551 (9th Cir.1985). To be material, the new evidence must bear directly and substantially on the matter in issue. <em>Key, </em>754 F.2d at 1551. Also, there must be a reasonable possibility that the new evidence would have changed the outcome if it had been before the Secretary. <em>Booz v. Secretary of Health and Human Services, </em>734 F.2d 1378, 1380-81 (9th Cir.1984). The question of materiality of the new evidence is one of law reviewed de novo by this court. <em>Id. </em>at 1380. To show good cause, the claimant must establish that she could not have obtained the evidence at the time of the administrative proceeding. <em>Key, </em>754 F.2d at 1551.</p>\n<p id=\"b1461-8\">Cotton contends that the district court erred in refusing to consider a January 1985 electromyogram that demonstrated that she had bilateral carpal tunnel syndrome. This finding was made almost 18 months after the AU\u2019s decision was made. Hence, to meet the materiality requirement, Cotton would be required to show that she had this condition for at least a year and a half before it was diagnosed. <em>See Ward v. Schweiker, </em>686 F.2d 762, 765 (9th Cir.1982). Cotton, however, did not complain of any problems with her hands either in her disability applications or at the hearing. Moreover, the January 1985 medical report stated that Cotton had \u201cdifficulty grasping and holding things <em>recently </em>\u201d (emphasis added). Thus, the evidence indicates that Cotton\u2019s carpal tunnel syndrome is a recent development that did not contribute to the problems she initially asked the Secretary to consider.</p>\n<p id=\"b1461-10\">The new evidence offered by Cotton does not warrant consideration on remand because it is not material to the Secretary\u2019s decision denying benefits.</p>\n<p id=\"b1461-11\">CONCLUSION</p>\n<p id=\"b1461-12\">We conclude that the AU erred both in his consideration of Cotton\u2019s pain testimony and in his rejection of Dr. Sciaroni\u2019s evidence. Accordingly, we remand the case to the Secretary for further proceedings consistent with this opinion.</p>\n<footnote label=\"1\">\n<p id=\"b1457-14\">. A claimant\u2019s residual functional capacity is what she can still do despite her physical or mental limitations. 20 C.F.R. \u00a7 404.1545(a) (1986).</p>\n</footnote>\n<footnote label=\"2\">\n<p id=\"b1458-11\">. Cotton testified that a nerve stimulator had lessened her leg pain by 80 percent. She also testified, however, that she had to cease this treatment because she could not afford to purchase her own machine. She tried the nerve stimulator on her back, but it gave her no relief.</p>\n</footnote>\n<footnote label=\"3\">\n<p id=\"b1459-10\">. To have reached this finding, the ALJ necessarily had to believe that Cotton suffered some degree of pain and functional limitation as a result of her medical condition.</p>\n</footnote>\n<footnote label=\"4\">\n<p id=\"b1459-11\">. 42 U.S.C. \u00a7 423(d)(5)(A), as amended in 1984, requires medical findings demonstrating an impairment \"which could reasonably be expected to produce the pain or other symptoms alleged.\u201d Cotton contends that the amended statute, is inapplicable here because it was enacted after the ALJ\u2019s decision. The amendment, however, applies to \"determinations made prior to January 1, 1987.\u201d Eub.L. 98-460 \u00a7 3(a)(3). Thus, the amended statute applies here.</p>\n</footnote>\n<footnote label=\"5\">\n<p id=\"b1460-8\">. Two further conclusions flow from our finding that the ALJ erred in his consideration of Cotton's subjective complaints. First, the AU's conclusion that Cotton had the residual functional capacity to perform a wide range of light work is not supported by substantial evidence. Cotton testified that she could not carry more than a single five pound grocery bag at one time. She testified that due to leg and back pain she could walk only two and a half blocks before having to rest. She testified that she suffers severe pain if she stands or sits for more than 30 minutes. This evidence demonstrates that Cotton could not perform a wide range of light work as defined by 20 C.F.R. \u00a7 404.1567(b) (1986). Second, the AU erred by relying exclusively on the grids and not taking account of Cotton\u2019s significant nonexertional limitations. See <em>Perminter v. Heckler, </em>765 F.2d 870, 871-72 (9th Cir.1985); <em>Allen v. Secretary of Health and Human Services, </em>726 F.2d 1470, 1472-73 (9th Cir.1984).</p>\n</footnote>\n<footnote label=\"6\">\n<p id=\"b1460-14\">. The AU\u2019s Finding No. 3 stated: \u201cThe medical evidence establishes that the claimant has severe hypertension, arthritis of the left ankle and left leg weakness.\"</p>\n</footnote>\n</opinion>\n</casebody>\n",
