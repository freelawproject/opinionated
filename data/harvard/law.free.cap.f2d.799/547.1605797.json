WRIGHT, Circuit Judge.</author>\n<p id=\"AEc\">This action was instituted in April of 1982. Plaintiffs-appellees are a labor union, five employers and nine employees of Hispanic ancestry. They complain of the manner in which the Immigration and Naturalization Service (INS) conducted searches and made arrests in factories and other places where it believed illegal aliens were employed. Specifically, plaintiffs challenge the constitutionality of \u201cfactory surveys\u201d occurring in northern California during the week of April 16, 1982, as part of \u201cProject Jobs,\u201d a nation-wide enforcement action against undocumented aliens.</p>\n<p id=\"b628-16\">Four years have passed since the inception of this action, but it has not yet been brought to trial.

Eighteen months after the motion was filed, the district court granted the requested preliminary injunction. 643 F.Supp. 884. It denied a motion by INS requesting a stay pending appeal.

INS focuses its challenge on the two provisions requiring that warrants specifically identify persons targeted in its factory searches. It also challenges the remainder of the injunction as an improper restriction on INS enforcement, arguing plaintiffs failed to show \u201csystematic misconduct contrary to official INS policy.\u201d</p>\n<p id=\"b629-9\">II. <em>Propriety of Injunctive Relief</em></p>\n<p id=\"ap8-dedup-0\">The first issue confronting us is whether the preliminary injunction was warranted. We conclude that the district court did not abuse its discretion in granting preliminary injunctive relief.</p>\n<p id=\"b629-13\">INS raises a weak argument that injunctive relief is unwarranted here because the evidence shows \u201cmerely sporadic violations of official policy by individual agents.\u201d The record supports the district court\u2019s finding of an \u201cevident systematic policy and practice of fourth amendment violations\u201d by INS. The extensive evidence of INS agents exceeding official policy can hardly be characterized as \u201c[a]n ambiguous, isolated incident [not warranting] injunctive relief.\u201d <em>INS v. Delgado, </em>466 U.S. 210, 218 n. 6, 104 S.Ct. 1758, 1764 n. 6, 80 L.Ed.2d 247 n. 6 (1984).<footnotemark>3</footnotemark></p>\n<p id=\"b629-14\">Plaintiffs observe correctly that INS has raised no specific challenges to the detailed factual findings on which the district court based the injunction.</p>\n<p id=\"b629-15\">INS argues that injunctive relief should not have been granted because plaintiffs failed to show a \u201csubstantial risk of repetition of past incidents.\u201d The district court made an explicit finding that, absent an injunction, \u201cplaintiffs are quite likely to suffer irreparable harm\u201d from continued fourth amendment violations by INS. \u201c[P]roof of past injury, especially of a repetitive character, is not immaterial to the issue of likely recurrence.\u201d <em>LaDuke v. Nelson, </em>762 F.2d 1318, 1324 n. 8 (9th Cir.1985), <em>amended on other grounds, </em>796 F.2d 309 (9th Cir.1986).</p>\n<p id=\"b629-16\">INS is correct that courts are reluctant to enjoin law enforcement agencies entitled to \u201cthe widest latitude in the \u2018dispatch of [their] own internal affairs,\u2019 \u201d <em>Riz-</em><page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"552\">*552</page-number><em>zo v. Goode, </em>423 U.S. 362, 378-79, 96 S.Ct. 598, 607-08, 46 L.Ed.2d 561 (1976) (quoting <em>Cafeteria Workers v. McElroy, </em>367 U.S. 886, 896, 81 S.Ct. 1743, 1749, 6 L.Ed.2d 1230 (1961)). However, the INS has \u201cno discretion with which to violate constitutional rights.\u201d <em>LaDuke, </em>762 F.2d at 1325. The district court\u2019s findings of fourth amendment violations were sufficient to support the decision to grant some preliminary injunctive relief.</p>\n<p id=\"b630-4\">III. <em>Restrictions on Entry Warrants</em></p>\n<p id=\"b630-5\">Next we must decide whether the specific provisions in the preliminary injunction order were proper and whether the terms of the injunction resulted from a proper application of substantive law.</p>\n<p id=\"b630-6\">A. <em>Specificity of the Entry Warrant</em></p>\n<p id=\"b630-7\">The INS contends that paragraphs two and three of the injunction<footnotemark>4</footnotemark> are invalid. It relies on the District of Columbia Circuit\u2019s decision in <em>Blackie\u2019s House of Beef v. Castillo, </em>659 F.2d 1211 (D.C.Cir.1981), <em>cert. denied, </em>455 U.S. 940, 102 S.Ct. 1432, 71 L.Ed.2d 651 (1982), for the proposition that a factory search may be based on a warrant that identifies <em>no </em>illegal aliens by name.</p>\n<p id=\"b630-12\"><em>Blackie\u2019s </em>rejected the contention that the INS open-ended warrant was comparable to the routine administrative inspection warrant upheld in <em>Marshall v. Barlow\u2019s, Inc., </em>436 U.S. 307, 98 S.Ct. 1816, 56 L.Ed.2d 305 (1978). 659 F.2d at 1218. Instead, it defined a hybrid standard of probable cause applicable to INS enforcement. <em>See </em>659 F.2d at 1222-25. A showing less than that required for criminal warrants was deemed appropriate because (1) Congress contemplated vigorous INS enforcement, including entries onto private premises to question aliens, and (2) INS activities are \u201cnot analogous to a criminal investigation\u201d where the <em>employer </em>faces \u201cno sanctions of any kind\u201d for employing illegal aliens. 659 F.2d at 1218.</p>\n<p id=\"b630-13\">The court in <em>Blackie\u2019s, </em>while accepting a hybrid probable cause standard for INS entry warrants,<footnotemark>5</footnotemark> emphasized the need for \u201csufficient safeguards to assure that nothing impermissible would be left to the discretion of the INS agents.\u201d 659 F.2d at 1226. We have held that an application for a search warrant \u201cmust have sufficient specificity to enable the judge to make an <em>independent determination </em>of whether probable cause exists and to prevent the agents from having uncontrolled discretion to rummage everywhere in search of seizable items once lawfully with<page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"553\">*553</page-number>in the premises.\u201d <em>United States v. Condo, </em>782 F.2d 1502, 1505 (9th Cir.1986) (emphasis in original).</p>\n<p id=\"b631-5\">Here, the district court stopped short of requiring the INS to identify all suspected illegal aliens by name to obtain an entry warrant. But, it required the INS, through \u201cthe warrant <em>and its supporting affidavits,\u201d </em>to provide information of sufficient specificity to assure that finding such persons is \u201creasonably likely.\u201d (Emphasis added).</p>\n<p id=\"b631-6\">At oral argument, we pressed plaintiffs counsel to propose a particularity standard for the INS to use in obtaining entry warrants for factory raids targeted at undocumented aliens. Counsel\u2019s inability to propose a workable standard reflects the difficulty of enforcing immigration laws where little documentary or descriptive information is available concerning suspected undocumented aliens.</p>\n<p id=\"b631-7\">The requirement to \u201cidentify the suspect(s) by name\u201d or to provide \u201cenough specific identifying information to assure that the search for that person is reasonably likely to result in finding that person\u201d imposes an unreasonable and impractical burden on the INS. We agree with the District of Columbia Circuit that \u201cwarrants and accompanying affidavits [that] narrow down the field of potentially vulnerable persons to those employees whom INS agents might reasonably believe to be aliens,\u201d 659 F.2d at 1226, satisfy the requirements of the Fourth Amendment even where the targeted persons are not identified by name.<footnotemark>6</footnotemark> The specificity that paragraphs two and three of the injunction order demand for entry warrants is not required under the Fourth Amendment.</p>\n<p id=\"b631-8\">B. <em>Restrictions on Consensual Questioning</em></p>\n<p id=\"b631-9\">Paragraph two also requires that every INS warrant contain a specific description of each suspect to be <em>questioned </em>and be based on \u201cprobable cause to believe each such person is an [illegal alien].\u201d An <em>arrest </em>requires probable cause to believe that the worker is an illegal alien, <em>see Tejeda-Mata v. INS, </em>626 F.2d 721, 724-25 (9th Cir.1980), <em>cert. denied, </em>456 U.S. 994, 102 S.Ct. 2280, 73 L.Ed.2d 1291 (1982), and a worker may not be <em>detained </em>absent \u201creasonable suspicion of illegal alienage,\u201d <em>Benitez-Mendez v. INS, </em>760 F.2d 907, 909 (9th Cir.1983). But, non-detentive questioning is permitted based solely on a reasonable suspicion that the person is an alien. <em>See LaDuke, </em>762 F.2d at 1327. Such \u201cconsensual encounters\u201d do not implicate the employee\u2019s Fourth Amendment rights. <em>Delgado, </em>466 U.S. at 221, 104 S.Ct. at 1765.</p>\n<p id=\"b631-15\">The Court in <em>Delgado </em>stated that no detention occurs in a factory survey as long as INS agents\u2019 conduct has \u201cgiven [workers] no reason to believe that they would be detained if they gave truthful answers to the questions put to them or if they simply refused to answer.\u201d 466 U.S. at 218, 104 S.Ct. at 1764. Where a worker merely \u201crefuses to answer,\u201d <em>id. </em>at 216, 104 S.Ct. at 1763, but does not attempt \u201cto flee or evade the agents,\u201d <em>id. </em>at 220, 104 S.Ct. at 1765, any \u201cadditional steps\u201d taken by the agents must be supported by \u201csome minimal level of objective justification to validate the detention or seizure.\u201d <em>Id. </em>at 216-17, 104 S.Ct. at 1763.</p>\n<p id=\"b631-16\">We find paragraphs two and three of the injunction order to have been improvidently entered. We strike these paragraphs from the injunction order because they exceed the particularity requirements of the Fourth Amendment and unduly restrict INS\u2019s ability to engage in consensual questioning.</p>\n<p id=\"b631-17\">Because of our conclusions as to paragraphs two and three of the injunction order, it is necessary also to strike para<page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"554\">*554</page-number>graph five.<footnotemark>7</footnotemark> The procedures specified in paragraph five make no sense in the absence of a warrant specifically identifying the targeted workers. Moreover, the restriction on generalized questioning is inconsistent with the holding of <em>Delgado, </em>at least where the INS agents have a reasonable suspicion that those questioned are aliens. <em>See LaDuke, </em>762 F.2d at 1327.</p>\n<p id=\"b632-4\">C. <em>Provocation of Flight</em></p>\n<p id=\"b632-5\">INS objects also to the restrictions in paragraph six of the injunction order which provides in part: \u201cWhen agents have no warrant, but intend to obtain consent upon arrival at the worksite rather than ahead of time, they must not arrive or conduct themselves in a manner that would <em>foreseeably </em>provoke flight by workers, or that would leave a reasonable person with the belief that he had no choice but to consent to the raid.\u201d (Emphasis added).</p>\n<p id=\"b632-6\">INS contends that this provision is unreasonable and overbroad since flight by workers is virtually always a \u201cforeseeable\u201d consequence of INS agents\u2019 arrival at a factory.</p>\n<p id=\"b632-7\">We note that the court used the word \u201cdeliberately\u201d in stating a similar restriction in paragraph seven. That appears to us to be a more understandable and enforceable standard than \u201cforeseeable\u201d provocation.</p>\n<p id=\"b632-8\">We direct that paragraph six be modified to substitute \u201cdeliberately\u201d for the word \u201cforeseeably.\u201d</p>\n<p id=\"b632-9\">IV. <em>Scope of Injunctive Relief</em></p>\n<p id=\"b632-10\">We construe the dispute over plaintiff employees\u2019 \u201cstanding\u201d as an attempt by INS to limit the injunction to workplaces of the named <em>employers </em>rather than the workplaces of the employee class. INS suggests that the district court lacked jurisdiction to enter an injunction order affecting non-party employers. Its reliance on <em>Zepeda, </em>753 F.2d 719, is misplaced. This court in <em>Zepeda </em>limited the injunction \u201cto apply only to the individual plaintiffs unless the district judge certifies a class of plaintiffs.\u201d <em>Id. </em>at 727. That holding does not limit the court\u2019s power to bind the INS when it has necessary personal and subject matter jurisdiction. <em>Id.</em></p>\n<p id=\"b632-14\">\u201c[A]n injunction benefiting nonparties is permissible \u2018if such breadth is necessary to give prevailing parties the relief to which they [individually] are entitled.\u2019 \u201d <em>Id. </em>at 729 n. 1 (quoting <em>Professional Association of College Educators v. El Paso County Community College District, </em>730 F.2d 258, 274 (5th Cir.), <em>cert. denied, </em>469 U.S. 881, 105 S.Ct. 248, 83 L.Ed.2d 186 (1984).</p>\n<p id=\"b632-15\">We find that the provisions of the preliminary injunction properly apply to workplaces of the employee class. Such injunctive relief is not overbroad, does not needlessly benefit nonparty plaintiffs, and is necessary to provide effective relief to the prevailing party.</p>\n<p id=\"b632-16\">V. <em>Evidentiary Hearing</em></p>\n<p id=\"b632-17\">INS contends that the district court erred in granting injunctive relief \u201csolely on the basis of affidavits or depositions.\u201d It contends that an evidentiary hearing was required to resolve disputed facts. <em>Dopp v. Franklin National Bank, </em>461 F.2d 873, 879 (2d Cir.1972). Rule 65(a)(1), Fed.R.Civ.P., has been interpreted to mean that parties have a right to be heard in opposition to a motion for a preliminary injunction, and that the right includes presenting <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"555\">*555</page-number>oral testimony when the pleadings and affidavits are conflicting. <em>Sims v. Greene, </em>161 F.2d 87, 88-89 (3d Cir.1947).</p>\n<p id=\"b633-5\">We choose not to follow the <em>Sims </em>presumption in favor of evidentiary hearings. <em>San Francisco-Oakland Newspaper Guild v. Kennedy, </em>412 F.2d 541, 546 &amp; n. 6 (9th Cir.1969) (Presentation of many affidavits and the oral argument constituted \u201csufficient opportunity to present [the] case [opposing preliminary injunction] without using oral testimony.\u201d).</p>\n<p id=\"b633-6\">Where sharply disputed the facts are simple and little time would be required for an evidentiary hearing, proceeding on affidavits alone might be inappropriate. <em>See Aguirre v. Chula Vista Sanitary Service and Sani-Tainer, Inc., </em>542 F.2d 779, 781 (9th Cir.1976) (citing <em>SEC v. Frank, </em>388 F.2d 486, 490-91 (2d Cir.1968)). But an evidentiary hearing should not be held when the magnitude of the inquiry would make it impractical. <em>Frank, </em>388 F.2d at 490.</p>\n<p id=\"b633-7\">The language of Rule 65(a) does not require a purely technical rule on this point. One authority suggests:</p>\n<blockquote id=\"b633-8\">Such requirements as there may be for hearings in applications for preliminary injunctions must stem, therefore, from general concepts of fairness, the underlying practice, the nature of the relief requested, and the circumstances of the particular cases.</blockquote>\n<p id=\"b633-9\">7 J. Moore, J. Lucas &amp; K. Sinclair, <em>Moore\u2019s Federal Practice </em>\u00b6 65.04[3] at 65-59 n. 12 (2d ed. 1986).</p>\n<p id=\"b633-10\">Here, some facts are in dispute, but the real problem involves the application of correct substantive law to those facts. The INS apparently never requested an opportunity to present oral testimony. In at least one circuit, failure to request an evi-dentiary hearing constitutes a waiver. <em>See Jacobson &amp; Co., Inc. v. Armstrong Cork Co., </em>548 F.2d 438, 442 (2d Cir.1977).</p>\n<p id=\"b633-11\">INS has not been unfairly deprived of the chance to show opposition to the issuance of a preliminary injunction. The district court did not abuse its discretion in granting the preliminary injunction without an evidentiary hearing.</p>\n<p id=\"b633-13\">VI. <em>Duration of Preliminary Injunction</em></p>\n<p id=\"AOi\">Finally, we consider the duration of this preliminary injunction. We note with concern the delay that has accompanied the dispute. At oral argument we asked counsel whether a trial date had been fixed or was reasonably foreseeable. We were given no encouraging assurances that the case would proceed to trial on the merits in the near future.</p>\n<p id=\"b633-14\">It is clear that plaintiffs have received all, indeed more than, the relief to which they are entitled. Having obtained this relief, they appear to have little or no incentive to press for a trial on the merits. We do not countenance such delay. This case should have been tried and decided long ago.</p>\n<p id=\"b633-15\">We do not suggest that the district judge was responsible for any of this delay because we suspect that the parties are to blame.</p>\n<p id=\"b633-16\">We have previously pointed out that we can assist very little in the final resolution of critical legal and factual issues until a <em>permanent </em>injunction is granted or denied. <em>Zepeda, </em>753 F.2d at 723. Our observations in <em>Zepeda </em>apply here:</p>\n<blockquote id=\"b633-17\">Furthermore, in many cases, appeal of a district court\u2019s preliminary injunction order will result in unnecessary delay to the parties and inefficient use of judicial resources. We think it likely that this case, for instance, could have proceeded to a disposition on the merits in far less time than it took to process this preliminary appeal. The parties, apparently, have made no effort in the district court to finalize this litigation____ In addition, our disposition of this appeal will affect the rights of the parties only until the district court renders judgment on the merits of the case, at which time the losing party may appeal again. One properly may wonder whether this is an efficient use of limited judicial facilities.</blockquote>\n<p id=\"ARX\"><em>Id. </em>at 724 (citation omitted).</p>\n<p id=\"b634-3\"><page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"556\">*556</page-number>From statements made at oral argument, we concluded that this case had been unduly delayed and terminated the injunction to prevent further delay. Subsequent review of the record has convinced us that this conclusion was unwarranted.</p>\n<p id=\"b634-4\">It appears that discovery will be completed by May 1, 1987 and trial will commence later that summer. This schedule, while not ideal, is not unexpected in a case of this scope and complexity. The injunction will not be terminated on October 28,1986.</p>\n<p id=\"b634-5\">The district court should ensure that this action proceeds to trial or other final resolution as rapidly as possible. If the district court, in its discretion, determines that plaintiffs are not prosecuting this action with all due diligence, it should dissolve the preliminary injunction.</p>\n<p id=\"b634-6\">We remand with instructions to modify the injunction as directed by this opinion.</p>\n<footnote label=\"1\">\n<p id=\"b628-14\">. An abuse of discretion will be found if the district court: (1) applied incorrect substantive law or an incorrect preliminary injunction standard; (2) based the decision on a clearly erroneous finding of a material fact; or (3) applied an acceptable preliminary injunction standard in a manner that results in an abuse of discretion. <em>Zepeda v. United States INS, </em>753 F.2d 719, 724 (9th Cir.1983).</p>\n</footnote>\n<footnote label=\"2\">\n<p id=\"b629-10\">. Although this formulation appears to state two separate tests, \u201cin fact there is only one, best described as a continuum in which the required showing of harm varies inversely with the required showing of meritoriousness.\u201d <em>San Diego Comm.

A warrant may not provide that \u2018others\u2019 may be searched and seized, if such 'others\u2019 are unnamed or only conclusorily described by any supporting affidavits.\u201d</blockquote>\n</footnote>\n<footnote label=\"5\">\n<p id=\"b630-11\">. The district court found that a typical warrant authorized not only entry into and search of the premises, but <em>seizures of persons </em>\u201csuspected of being aliens.\" Although, this finding is amply supported by the record, the INS concedes that the warrants could properly authorize only entry into the workplace to question suspected aliens. Thus, it is unnecessary for us to decide whether the hybrid probable cause standard that <em>Blackie\u2019s </em>applied to entry warrants should apply to warrants that, on their face, authorize seizure of suspected illegal aliens.</p>\n<p id=\"A9B\">Having now taken this position, INS cannot object to a permanent injunction that prohibits warrants to seize suspected aliens unless the warrants meet the particularity requirements applied to arrest warrants. To the extent the warrants authorize INS to seize employees, the Supreme Court\u2019s holding in <em>Ybarra v. Illinois, </em>444 U.S. 85, 100 S.Ct. 338, 62 L.Ed.2d 238 (1979), requires \"probable cause <em>particularized with respect to that person.\" Id. </em>444 U.S. at 91, 100 S.Ct. at 342 (emphasis added). \"This requirement cannot be undercut or avoided by simply pointing to the fact that coincidentally there exists probable cause to search or seize another or to search the premises where the person may happen to be.\" <em>Id.</em></p>\n</footnote>\n<footnote label=\"6\">\n<p id=\"b631-10\">. We recognize that the Supreme Court in <em>INS v. Delgado, </em>466 U.S. 210, 104 S.Ct. 1758, 80 L.Ed.2d 247 (1984), did not expressly decide the particularity requirement for an entry warrant used in INS factory raids. Yet the Court made explicit reference to the agents\u2019 lawful presence in the factories based on warrants that did not identify <em>any </em>suspected illegal aliens by name. <em>See </em>466 U.S. at 212, 217 n. 4, 104 S.Ct. at 1760, 1762 n. 4</p>\n</footnote>\n<footnote label=\"7\">\n<p id=\"b632-11\">. Paragraph five of the injunction order provides:</p>\n<blockquote id=\"b632-12\">\u201cEach warrant must provide that the agents executing the warrant, before searching any work area, must show the warrant to an authorized company representative, and ask that representative to produce the suspect(s) named or described in the warrant. Before the suspects are produced, agents may position themselves at exits and question or detain any workers attempting to flee. If the representative is unwilling or unable to produce those suspects within a reasonable time, agents may then enter the work area to search for the suspects. Such searches must be directed at finding the named or described suspects as quickly as possible, rather than for general questioning of the entire workforce. This does not preclude agents from questioning or detaining workers who attempt to hide or flee.\u201d</blockquote>\n</footnote>\n</opinion>\n</casebody>\n",
