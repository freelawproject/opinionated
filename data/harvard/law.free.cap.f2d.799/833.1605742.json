Korner, III, <em>Judge, </em>upholding the Commissioner of Internal Revenue\u2019s finding that the club had made inadequate tax payments on the portion of its 1979 and 1980 earnings subject to income tax under 26 U.S.C. \u00a7 511 (1982).<footnotemark>1</footnotemark> The club had avoided paying any income tax by using losses it suffered in providing meals to non-members to offset its investment income. The Tax Court concluded that 26 U.S.C. \u00a7 512(a)(3)(A)<footnotemark>2</footnotemark> permitted the club to deduct from income only those expenses which were directly related to the generation of that income. Since The Brook\u2019s losses in providing meals to non-members were un<page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"835\">*835</page-number>related to the generation of the investment income, the court held they were nondeductible. We reject the Tax Court\u2019s interpretation of the Tax Code, but affirm the court\u2019s decision on a different ground. Under \u00a7 512(a)(3)(A) a social club may take a deduction only if that deduction is allowed by some provision of Chapter 1 of the Code. Since the Brook\u2019s deduction of the losses it suffered in providing food to nonmembers is not authorized by any provision of Chapter 1, it was properly disallowed.</p>\n<p id=\"b911-5\">The facts are not in dispute. The Brook qualifies as a private social club under 26 U.S.C. \u00a7 501(c)(7). Accordingly, it is subject to income tax only on its \u201cunrelated business taxable income.\u201d 26 U.S.C. \u00a7 511(a)(1). The phrase \u201cunrelated business taxable income\u201d as applied to social clubs is defined in 26 U.S.C. \u00a7 512(a)(3)(A) as \u201cthe gross income (excluding any exempt function income) less the deductions allowed by this chapter [Chapter I] which are directly connected with the production of the gross income (excluding exempt function income) ... \u201d. Exempt function income is \u201cthe gross income from dues, fees, charges, or similar amounts paid by members of the organization as consideration for providing such members or their dependents or guests [with] goods, facilities, or services in furtherance of the purposes constituting the basis for the exemption of the organization to which such income is paid.\u201d 26 U.S.C. \u00a7 512(a)(3)(B).</p>\n<p id=\"b911-6\">During the 1979 and 1980 tax years The Brook had two sources of non-member unrelated business taxable income: (i) investments and (ii) food and beverages sold to non-members at private dinner parties hosted by club members. In both years the club showed substantial investment income, but avoided paying any income tax on this taxable income by deducting from it losses incurred in the sale of meals to non-members. On its returns the Brook attributed the \u201cdirect\u201d expenses of feeding the non-members (food, beverages, payroll, etc.) and a portion of the general overhead expenses of running the club to the activity of providing meals to non-members. The Commissioner concedes that the estimate of \u201cdirect expenses\u201d was accurate and that the overhead costs were \u201cproperly attributable to and directly connected with the generation of nonmember income.\u201d <em>Parties\u2019 Stipulation of Facts </em>at 5. Once the expenses were allocated, however, it became evident that The Brook suffered substantial losses from serving meals to nonmembers. In fact, in both 1979 and 1980 its expenses, including the portion of general overhead allocated to the activity of providing food to non-members, were almost twice the income the non-members brought to the club. Furthermore, those years were no fluke. The Brook concedes that it incurred similar losses \u201cfor tax purposes from the sale of food and beverages to non-members\u201d for every year between 1972 and 1983. <em>Id.</em></p>\n<p id=\"b911-8\">The club lost money each year because it intentionally chose to charge non-members less for meals than it cost to provide them. Though members and non-members paid the same prices for meals, the club admits that the meal prices were \u201cinsufficient to recover the full costs [of serving those meals] including overhead.\u201d <em>Id. </em>at 2. The members indirectly made up part of the shortfall, at least as regards the meals they ate, through use of their non-taxable dues, which constituted \u201ca substantial subsidy to the Club\u2019s food and beverage business.\u201d <em>Plaintiffs Petition to Tax Court </em>at 2. There was no similar, indirect way by which non-members paid the club the full cost of the meals the club provided. Accordingly the club concedes that it simply did not intend to make money from selling food and beverages to non-members. In its words, it \u201cdid not sell food and beverages to non-members with an intention that revenues from such sales would exceed all costs relating to such sales including overhead.\u201d <em>Parties\u2019 Stipulation of Facts </em>at 3.</p>\n<p id=\"b911-9\">In 1981 the Commissioner issued Rev. Rui. 81-69, 1981-1 Cum.Bull. 351, holding that when \u201c[a] social club operates a food and beverage concession catering to nonmembers and has consistently sold the food and beverages at prices insufficient to recover the cost of sales[, t]he club may not, <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"836\">*836</page-number>in determining its unrelated business taxable income, reduce its net investment income by the losses from these sales to nonmembers.\u201d The Commissioner audited The Brook\u2019s 1979 and 1980 returns, and, relying on Rev.Rul. 81-69, concluded that, though the club had reported its \u201cgross income\u201d correctly, it owed $5,000 in back taxes. The Commissioner held that the club could only deduct expenses incurred in feeding non-members up to the amount of income the club received from that activity. The Commissioner rested his finding on the fact that, since the club had not intended to profit from the sales of food and beverages to non-members, the deductions were not allowable under 26 U.S.C. \u00a7 162<footnotemark>3</footnotemark> as a trade or business expense. The Brook never suggested that the expenses were deductible under any other provision of the Code.</p>\n<p id=\"b912-4\">The Brook petitioned the Tax Court for review of the Commissioner\u2019s decision. The Tax Court upheld the Commissioner, but on a theory the Commissioner had never advocated. The Court found that \u00a7 512(a)(3)(A) required that there be a nexus between an expense and the income it was used to offset. Since there was no nexus between the food expenses and the investment income, the court disallowed the deduction. Both the Commissioner and The Brook sought reconsideration, arguing that the Court\u2019s reading of \u00a7 512 conflicted with prior Tax Court decisions, the plain meaning of the statute and the Treasury Department\u2019s proposed regulations. The Tax Court, however, issued a Supplemental Decision on December 17, 1985 affirming its earlier holding.</p>\n<p id=\"b912-10\">The Brook appealed.</p>\n<p id=\"b912-11\">DISCUSSION</p>\n<p id=\"b912-12\">The determinative question on this appeal is how \u00a7 512(a)(3)(A) should be interpreted. In construing a statute we usually adopt the plain and literal meaning of its language, <em>United States v. Locke, </em>471 U.S. 84, 105 S.Ct. 1785, 1792, 85 L.Ed.2d 64 (1985); <em>Consumer Product Safety Commission v. GTE Sylvania, Inc., </em>447 U.S. 102, 108, 100 S.Ct. 2051, 2056, 64 L.Ed.2d 766 (1980), unless it produces an interpretation which makes little sense, <em>Chemical Mfrs. Ass\u2019n v. Natural Res. Defense Council, </em>470 U.S. 116, 105 S.Ct. 1102, 1108, 84 L.Ed.2d 90 (1985); <em>United States v. Turkette, 452 </em>U.S. 576, 587, 101 S.Ct. 2524, 2530, 69 L.Ed.2d 246 (1981) , does violence to the purposes Congress sought to serve by the statute, <em>Chapman v. Houston Welfare Rights Organization, </em>441 U.S. 600, 608, 99 S.Ct. 1905, 1911, 60 L.Ed.2d 508 (1979), or is otherwise \u201cdemonstrably at odds with the intentions of [the statute\u2019s] drafters.\u201d <em>Griffin v. Oceanic Contractors, Inc., </em>458 U.S. 564, 571, 102 S.Ct. 3245, 3250, 73 L.Ed.2d 973 (1982). <em>See also Bread Political Action Committee v. F.E.R.C., </em>455 U.S. 577, 580, 102 S.Ct. 1235, 1237, 71 L.Ed.2d 432 (1982).<footnotemark>4</footnotemark></p>\n<p id=\"b913-4\"><page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"837\">*837</page-number>Section 512(a)(3)(A) defines a social club\u2019s \u201cunrelated business taxable income\u201d as \u201cgross income (excluding any exempt function income) less the deductions allowed by this chapter which are directly connected with the production of the gross income.\u201d The Tax Court read the \u201cdirectly connected\u201d language to create a requirement that a deduction may only be offset against income it directly helped to generate. Since the expenses The Brook incurred in serving meals to non-members had nothing to do with generating its investment income, the Tax Court concluded that they could not be used to offset that income and should therefore be disallowed. Under this theory a social club\u2019s earnings from a specific activity in a given year would place a ceiling on the deductions that activity can generate in that year. Losses from one taxable activity could not be used to offset gains from another. We disagree with this interpretation of the statute.</p>\n<p id=\"b913-5\">In plain unambiguous language, \u00a7 512(a)(3)(A) provides that allowable deductions should be taken against <em>\u201cgross </em>income\u201d and only requires that the deductions be related to the generation of that <em>\u201cgross </em>income.\u201d (Emphasis added). The Code defines \u201cgross income\u201d as \u201call income from whatever source derived.\u201d 26 U.S.C. \u00a7 61. The term refers to the sum total of the taxpayer\u2019s income \u201cexcept [for that which is] specifically exempted.\u201d <em>Commissioner v. Kowalski, </em>434 U.S. 77, 83, 98 S.Ct. 315, 319, 54 L.Ed.2d 252 (1978); <em>Commissioner v. Glenshaw Glass Co., </em>348 U.S. 426, 429-30, 75 S.Ct. 473, 475-76, 99 L.Ed. 483 (1955). <em>See also Commissioner v. Jacobson, </em>336 U.S. 28, 46-47, 69 S.Ct. 358, 367-68, 93 L.Ed. 477 (1949). Accordingly, on its face, \u00a7 512(a)(3)(A) authorizes deductions to be taken from the sum total of a club\u2019s non-exempt gross income, not merely from the portion of that income connected to the particular deduction. The \u201cdirectly connected\u201d language simply requires that the deductions arise from the production of gross income, \u201cexcluding any exempt function income\u201d, i.e., that the deduction be related to the generation of some portion of the club\u2019s total taxable gross income.</p>\n<p id=\"b913-7\">The foregoing meaning of the statute\u2019s plain language is reinforced by its legislative history. The Treasury Department noted, when proposing \u00a7 512(a)(3)(A) to the House and Senate, that \u201cgross income\u201d as used in \u00a7 512(a)(3)(A) meant <em>\u201call </em>income, other than that from members in exchange for exempt function facilities.\u201d <em>Tax Reform Studies and Proposals, </em>U.S. Treasury Department, House Comm, on Ways and Means and Senate Comm, on Finance, Jt. Publication, 91st Cong., 1st Sess., Pt. 3 at 325 (emphasis added). There was no suggestion that deductions would only be allowable to the extent they did not exceed the income generated by the activity for which the deduction was taken. To the contrary, the Treasury Department emphasized that \u201cdeductions would be allowable if directly connected with <em>an activity generating income </em>subject to tax,\u201d <em>id. </em>(emphasis in original).</p>\n<p id=\"b913-8\">To limit a social club\u2019s deductions to those related to the specific activity generating the income against which they are offset (in this case the income from service of meals to non-members) would be inconsistent with Congress\u2019 intent in adopting \u00a7 512(a)(3)(A) as part of the Tax Reform Act of 1969, Pub.L. No. 91-172, 83 Stat. 487, which was to insure that members of social clubs should not receive tax benefits or suffer tax losses simply because they had \u201cjoined together [in a social club] for recreation or pleasure.\u201d S.Rep. No. 91-152, 91st Cong., 1st Sess. 71 (1969-3 Cum. Bull. 423, 469-70); H.R.Rep. No. 91-413 (Pt. 1), 91st Cong., 1st Sess. 47 (1969-3 Cum.Bull. 200, 231) U.S.Code Cong. &amp; Admin.News 1969 pp. 1645, 1693, 2027, 2100. The House and Senate Reports stated that Congress hoped \u201cto allow individuals to join together to provide recreational or social facilities on a mutual basis, <em>without tax consequences </em>... [so that] the individual is in substantially the same position as if he had spent his income on pleasure or recreation (or other benefits) without the intervening separate organization.\u201d S.Rep. 91-552, <em>supra, </em>at 71; H.R.Rep. No. 91-413, <em>supra, </em>at 48 U.S.Code Cong. &amp; Admin. <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"838\">*838</page-number>News at 1693, 2100 (emphasis added). <em>See also Tax Reform Studies and Proposals, supra, </em>Pt. 3 at 315. If the club members had functioned as individuals or a non-exempt corporation they would be permitted to deduct the cost of carrying on an activity for profit from their total gross income without any requirement that the income in any given year from a particular business activity exceed the deductible expenses of that activity. 26 U.S.C. \u00a7\u00a7 162, 212. The effect of the Tax Court\u2019s reading of \u00a7 512(a)(3)(A), however, would be to penalize social clubs by not permitting them to aggregate deductions and income arising out of unrelated business activity as permitted by \u00a7 162 to other taxpayers.</p>\n<p id=\"b914-4\">Although the plain language and legislative history of \u00a7 512(a)(3)(A) do not support the Tax Court\u2019s interpretation of the law, The Brook was still required to establish that \u00a7 162 of Chapter 1, which is incorporated by reference in \u00a7 512(a)(3)(A), authorizes its deduction from its investment income of the losses suffered from its serving of meals to non-members. This it failed to do. Section 162 allows \u201cas a deduction all the ordinary and necessary expenses paid or incurred during the taxable year in carrying on any trade or business.\u201d An activity qualifies as a \u201ctrade or business\u201d capable of generating deductions under \u00a7 162 only if the taxpayer engaged in the activity with the intention of making a profit. <em>See United States v. American Bar Endowment, </em>106 S.Ct. 2426, 91 L.Ed.2d 89 (1986) (quoting <em>Brannen v. Commissioner, </em>722 F.2d 695, 705 (11th Cir.1984)); <em>Lamont v. C.I.R., </em>339 F.2d 377, 380 (2d Cir.1964); <em>Bessenyey v. C.I.R., </em>379 F.2d 252, 256 (2d Cir.), <em>cert. denied, </em>389 U.S. 931, 88 S.Ct. 293, 19 L.Ed.2d 283 (1967); <em>Porter v. C.I.R., </em>437 F.2d 39, 40-41 (2d Cir.1971).<footnotemark>5</footnotemark> The Brook has stipulated that it had no such profit motive when it engaged in the unrelated activity of selling meals to non-members. Accordingly, since the plain language of \u00a7 512(a)(3)(A) requires that a social club may only deduct an expense if Chapter 1 authorizes that deduction, The Brook improperly used its losses from serving meals to non-members to write off a portion of its gross income from its investment activity.</p>\n<p id=\"b914-7\">The Brook, however, contends that Congress did not intend \u00a7 512(a)(3)(A) to require that social clubs satisfy all the requirements of \u00a7 162 in order to take deductions under the provision. A social club, The Brook argues, may deduct expenses arising from activities which it did not engage in for profit so long as the club engaged in the activity with \u201ca basic purpose of economic gain.\u201d The Brook then asserts that a taxpayer intends to realize \u201ceconomic gain\u201d if it expects to receive some money from that activity, even though the taxpayer knows or indeed intends (as in the present case) that the expense of carrying out the activity (selling meals to non-members) will exceed any income the activity generates. Since The Brook\u2019s reading of \u00a7 512 has been accepted by the Sixth Circuit, <em>Cleveland Athletic Club, Inc. v. United States, </em>779 F.2d 1160, 1165 (6th Cir.1985), it is with some reluctance that we reject it.</p>\n<p id=\"b914-8\">The Brook\u2019s proposed reading of \u00a7 512(a)(3)(A) would negate Congress\u2019 express purpose that social clubs be treated neutrally with respect to their unrelated business income and neither suffer nor benefit under the Code.<footnotemark>6</footnotemark> The club\u2019s inter<page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"839\">*839</page-number>pretation would grant social clubs a tax advantage by allowing them to take \u00a7 162 deductions unavailable to other taxpayers, i.e., for expenses incurred in activities not engaged in for a profit. Indeed, under the Sixth Circuit\u2019s view a social club could avoid paying any income tax whatsoever by using otherwise taxable investment income to subsidize the meals of non-members (who would normally be friends or acquaintances of the members, eating at the club at the members\u2019 invitation).</p>\n<p id=\"b915-5\">The Sixth Circuit suggests that adoption of the \u201ceconomic gain\u201d test in lieu of the \u201cprofit motive\u201d test does not necessarily give the club a tax advantage because under \u00a7 162 \u201c[t]he profit factor is really only significant insofar as it is a means of distinguishing between an enterprise carried on in good faith as a \u2018trade or business\u2019 and an enterprise carried on merely as a hobby.\u201d <em>Cleveland Athletic Club, supra, </em>779 F.2d at 1165 (quoting <em>Trustees of Graceland Cemetery Improvement Fund v. United States, </em>515 F.2d 763, 768 (1975) (quoting 4A Mertens, <em>Law of Federal Income Taxation, </em>\u00a7 25.08 (1972) ).<footnotemark>7</footnotemark> We disagree and are persuaded that a switch to an \u201ceconomic gain\u201d test would give social clubs a tax advantage not enjoyed by other taxpayers. <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"840\">*840</page-number>\u00a7 183). Indeed, it is precisely the existence of a profit motive which distinguishes activities taxed under \u00a7 162 from those taxed as \u201chobbies\u201d under \u00a7 183. <em>See, e.g., Eastman v. United States, </em>635 F.2d 833, 837 (Ct.Cl.1980); <em>Carter v. C.I.R., </em>645 F.2d 784, 786 (9th Cir.1981); <em>Dreicer v. C.I.R., </em>665 F.2d 1292, 1294-99 (D.C.Cir.1983); <em>Nickerson v. C.I.R., </em>700 F.2d 402, 404 (7th Cir.1983); <em>Brannen, supra, </em>722 F.2d at 702-04; <em>Estate of Power v. C.I.R., </em>736 F.2d 826, 827-28 (1st Cir.1984); <em>Faulconer v. C.I.R., </em>748 F.2d 890, 893 (4th Cir.1984).</p>\n<p id=\"b915-12\"><page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"839\">*839</page-number>The advantage becomes readily apparent when one examines the Code\u2019s \u201chobby loss\u201d provision, \u00a7 183, which applies to \u201cactivities] not engaged in for profit\u201d, including \u201cany activity other than one with respect to which deductions are allowable ... under section 162 or under paragraph (1) or (2) of section 212\u201d. The mere fact that hobbies generate receipts, or \u201ceconomic gain\u201d, does not entitle them to \u00a7 162 tax treatment. <em>See </em>26 U.S.C. \u00a7 183(b)(2) (taxpayer may deduct expenses incurred in not-for-profit activity only up to the amount of the income received from the activity); <em>Brdnnen, supra, </em>722 F.2d at 705 (activity generating some economic return taxable under \u00a7 183); <em>Nickerson, supra, </em>700 F.2d at 403 (same); <em>Dreicer, supra, </em>665 F.2d at 1295 (assuming activity which generates economic return could be taxed under</p>\n<p id=\"b916-4\"><page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"840\">*840</page-number>Accordingly, the taxpayer engaged in an activity from which he does not intend to profit may only take deductions up to the amount of the income generated by the activity. Under the Sixth Circuit\u2019s reading of \u00a7 512(a)(3)(A), however, social clubs would be permitted to take such deductions under \u00a7 162 regardless of the amount of income generated by the underlying \u201cnot-for-profit\u201d activity. In the present case, for instance, although the not-for-profit activity (selling meals to non-members) generated income far below the cost of that activity, the club did not limit itself to offsetting that income against its cost but used income from a profitable activity (private investments) to make up the loss. Thus replacement of \u00a7 162\u2019s \u201cprofit motive\u201d requirement by an \u201ceconomic gain\u201d test would give social clubs a tax advantage not enjoyed by other taxpayers. Such subsidization departs from Congress\u2019 declared purpose in enacting \u00a7 512(a)(3)(A).</p>\n<p id=\"b916-5\">The Sixth Circuit also rests its interpretation of \u00a7 512(a)(3)(A) on the fact that \u00a7 512(a) contains two definitions of \u201cunrelated business taxable income\u201d. One (with which we are concerned here) applies to social clubs, certain \u201cvoluntary employees\u2019 beneficiary associations\u201d, certain \u201ctrusts forming part of a plan providing for the payment of supplemental unemployment compensation benefits\u201d and organizations \u201cthe exclusive function of which is to form part of a qualified group legal services plan.\u201d 26 U.S.C. \u00a7\u00a7 501(c), 512(a)(3)(A). The second definition, set out in \u00a7 512(a)(1), applies to all other tax-exempt groups, including charitable corporations, corporations run by religious groups, and non-profit civic leagues \u201coperated exclusively for the promotion of social welfare\u201d. It defines \u201cunrelated business taxable income\u201d as \u201cthe gross income derived by any organization from any unrelated trade or business (as defined in Section 513) regularly carried on by it, less the deductions allowed by this chapter which are directly connected with the carrying on of such trade or business.\u201d 26 U.S.C. \u00a7 512(a)(1).</p>\n<p id=\"b916-7\">The major difference between these two definitions is that in \u00a7 512(a)(3)(A) Congress removed the \u201ctrade or business\u201d requirement from the definition of unrelated business taxable income and available deductions of social clubs and other \u00a7 512(a)(3)(A) entities, substituting the phrase \u201cless the deductions allowed by this chapter [Chapter 1] which are directly connected with the production of gross income (excluding exempt function income)...\u201d. Since \u00a7 162 only allows deduction of \u201cexpenses paid or incurred during the taxable year in carrying on any trade or business\u201d, the Sixth Circuit reasoned that applying the section literally to social clubs would read the \u201ctrade and business\u201d requirement back into \u00a7 512(a)(3)(A) and thereby render meaningless Congress\u2019 deletion of the \u201ctrade or business\u201d language from that section\u2019s definition of \u201cunrelated business taxable income\u201d. <em>Cleveland Athletic Club, supra, </em>779 F.2d at 1665. We do not find this reasoning persuasive.</p>\n<p id=\"b916-8\">The difference in language between \u00a7 512(a)(3)(A) and \u00a7 512(a)(1) does not in our view suggest that Congress intended to amend \u00a7 162 for the benefit of social clubs. On the contrary, the difference is rooted in Congress\u2019 intent to tax entities such as social clubs more comprehensively than charitable and religious organizations, which are dedicated to more altruistic purposes. <em>Tax Reform </em>(Pt. 1), <em>supra, </em>at 42. Section 512(a)(1) taxes the latter\u2019s income only if it is derived from a \u201ctrade or business the conduct of which is not substantially related ... to the exercise or performance by [the tax-exempt organization] of its charitable, educational, or other pur<page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"841\">*841</page-number>pose.\u201d \u00a7\u00a7 512(a)(1), 513(a). As a result, entities covered by \u00a7 512(a)(1) are permitted to exclude \u201call dividends, interest, payments with respect to securities loans ... and annuities\u201d from their taxable income, \u00a7 512(b)(1), as well as income from rents, \u00a7 512(b)(3), and, in the case of universities, income derived from certain types of research. \u00a7 512(b)(7). Indeed, income is only taxable under \u00a7 512(a)(1) if it (i) arises from a trade or business; (ii) which is regularly carried on; and (iii) is not substantially related to the taxpayer\u2019s tax-exempt purposes. <em>American Bar Endowment, supra, </em>106 S.Ct. at 2429-30; <em>American College of Physicians, supra, </em>106 S.Ct. at 1594-95.</p>\n<p id=\"b917-5\">In contrast, \u00a7 512(a)(3)(A) organizations, including social clubs, are subject to a much more far-reaching tax than charitable organizations. Social clubs are taxed on all of their income except that portion which comes \u201cfrom dues, fees, charges, or similar amounts paid by members of the organization as consideration for providing such members or their dependents or guests goods, facilities, or services in furtherance of the purposes constituting the basis for the exemption of the organization to which such income is paid.\u201d \u00a7\u00a7 512(a)(3)(A), 512(a)(3)(B). Indeed, the House, Senate and Treasury Department expressly stated in their reports on \u00a7 512 that the investment income of \u00a7 512(a)(3)(A) organizations should be taxed. H.R.Rep. No. 91-412 (Pt. 1), <em>supra, </em>at 47-48, S.Rep. No. 91-552, <em>supra, </em>at 71; <em>Tax Reform </em>(Pt. 3), <em>supra </em>at 316.</p>\n<p id=\"b917-6\">Having provided that the taxable income of social clubs and other \u00a7 512(a)(3)(A) organizations should be broader in type and scope than that of \u00a7 512(a)(1) entities, Congress accordingly tailored the deductions allowable to each type of organization according to the income to be taxed. Since only \u201ctrade or business\u201d income was taxed under \u00a7 512(a)(1), Congress provided that \u00a7 512(a)(1) organizations could only take deductions \u201cdirectly connected with the carrying on of that trade or business\u201d. It specifically excluded deductions \u201cdirectly connected\u201d with generating income from dividends, interest, security loans, etc., \u00a7 512(b)(1), for the reason that such income was not taxable to charitable corporations. Since \u00a7 512(a)(3)(A) taxed the income of social clubs more broadly, however, it also allowed a wider range of deductions to be taken by organizations covered by it (i.e., those \u201cdirectly connected with the production of the gross income\u201d), including many deductions unavailable to \u00a7 512(a)(1) entities. For example, social clubs may deduct under \u00a7 212 a range of expenses incurred \u201cin profit seeking activities that do not rise to a level of a \u2018trade or business\u2019 \u201d, <em>Faulconer, supra, </em>748 F.2d at 892, including deduction of expenses related to the production of income from investments, rental of real property, sales of property, and research.</p>\n<p id=\"b917-8\">It may not, therefore, be inferred from the difference in language between \u00a7 512(a)(3)(A) and \u00a7 512(a)(1) that Congress intended social clubs to be relieved from the requirements of \u00a7 162 so that they would receive an advantage over other taxpayers claiming deductions under that provision. No such intent is expressed in the legislative history. On the contrary, the difference exists because \u00a7 512(a)(3)(A) taxes entities covered by it on income not taxed in the case of \u00a7 512(a)(1) organizations, and, accordingly, allows \u00a7 512(a)(3)(A) organizations deductions related to that broader income, which would be inappropriate under \u00a7 512(a)(1). Applying \u00a7 162 to social clubs in the same manner as it is applied to other taxpayers does not erode the distinction between the differing provisions of \u00a7 512. Like everyone else, social clubs may claim \u00a7 162 deductions for expenses they incur when carrying out a \u201ctrade or business\u201d (i.e., engaging in an activity with a profit motive). They may also claim deductions under provisions, such as \u00a7 212, which do not have a \u201ctrade or business\u201d requirement and which may be unavailable to \u00a7 512(a)(1) entities. They may not, however, under \u00a7 162 deduct from otherwise taxable income losses suffered in an activity not engaged in for profit.</p>\n<p id=\"b918-3\"><page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"842\">*842</page-number>Since the language of \u00a7 512(a)(3)(A) is clear and The Brook\u2019s claimed deductions do not qualify for allowance under Chapter 1 of the Tax Code, the finding of the Tax Court that The Brook\u2019s tax payments were deficient in 1979 and 1980 is affirmed.</p>\n<footnote label=\"1\">\n<p id=\"b910-12\">. 26 U.S.C. \u00a7 511 provides in pertinent part:</p>\n<blockquote id=\"afg-dedup-0\">\u201c\u00a7 511.

We do not ignore the fact that \u00a7\u00a7 511-13 of the Code are also designed to serve other purposes, including the elimination of unfair competition between tax-exempt and taxable commercial enterprises that had occurred under the laws as they previously stood. Congress first taxed business income not \"substantially related\" to the objectives of a tax exempt organization in the Revenue Act of 1950, Pub.L. No. 81-814, \u00a7 301, 64 Stat. 906, 947 (1950) (codified at 26 U.S.C. \u00a7\u00a7 511-13), because \u201c[pjrior law <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"839\">*839</page-number>had required only that the profits garnered by exempt organizations be used in furtherance of tax-exempt purposes, without regard to the source of those profits.... As a result, tax-exempt organizations were able to carry on full-fledged commercial enterprises in competition with corporations whose profits were fully taxed ... Congress perceived a need to restrain th[is] unfair competition fostered by the tax laws.\u201d <em>United States v.

In 1969, Congress, for similar reasons, expanded \u00a7\u00a7 511-13 to tax the unrelated business income of certain tax-exempt groups not covered by the Revenue Act of 1950, including churches, social welfare organizations, fraternal beneficiary societies, and social clubs. <em>See </em>Tax Reform Act of 1969, Pub.L.

The passage from Mertens does not eliminate a \"profit motive\u201d test from \u00a7 162. Indeed, read as a whole it states that deductions are only available under \u00a7 162 if they stem from an activity carried on for profit. The passage, now appearing at 4A Mertens, <em>Law of Federal Income Taxation, </em>\u00a7 25.10 at 34 (1986), states: \"In order that the taxpayer\u2019s activities may constitute the carrying on of a 'trade or business,\u2019 he need not have a reasonable expectation of a profit.

If so, the case espouses a view which has been expressly rejected, as far as we know, in every other circuit or court of claims decision that has considered it, <em>see supra, </em>at 10, n. 5 However, the decision may not be so extreme. It held that an incorporated improvement fund, whose principal purpose was to care for and maintain a cemetery for a company which operated the cemetery for profit, was carrying on a \"trade or business\u201d and could, therefore, take deductions under \u00a7 162. The case may mean no more than that, under its particular facts, the subsidiary enterprise took on the tax status (and profit-motive) of its controlling parent. <em>See Northern Cal. Cent.
