He sought relief from a 1980 state court conviction of two counts of first degree robbery, accompanied by a special finding that he was armed with a deadly weapon. We affirm.</p>\n<p id=\"b1402-13\">BACKGROUND</p>\n<p id=\"b1402-14\">On June 15, 1979, the Seattle police arrested Pil\u00f3n for the robbery of a pharmacy that took place six days earlier. The next day the police conducted a lineup in which Pil\u00f3n and five other inmates of the local jail participated. Five witnesses viewed the lineup. Pil\u00f3n was identified positively by one of the lineup witnesses, tentatively by another, and alternatively by a third witness. At a pretrial hearing, Pil\u00f3n moved to suppress the lineup identification. He claimed the circumstances surrounding the robbery and the eyewitness identification procedure rendered his identification as the robber impermissibly suggestive and unreliable. Pilon\u2019s suppression motion was denied and he proceeded to trial.</p>\n<p id=\"b1402-16\">At trial, four of the witnesses to the lineup identified Pil\u00f3n as the robber. The robbery had been committed by a man and a woman. The woman testified at Pilon\u2019s trial. She admitted she had participated in the robbery. She testified, however, that the person with whom she had committed the robbery was not Pil\u00f3n but someone else. Pil\u00f3n did not testify. A jury returned a special verdict finding Pil\u00f3n guilty of two counts of first degree robbery while armed with a deadly weapon. Pil\u00f3n was sentenced to two concurrent life terms. The Washington Court of Appeals affirmed his conviction and the Washington Supreme Court denied review.</p>\n<p id=\"b1402-17\">Having exhausted his state remedies, Pi-Ion petitioned the federal district court for a writ of habeas corpus alleging that the state court had committed errors of federal constitutional dimension in admitting the eyewitnesses\u2019 identification testimony at trial, in denying his <em>in limine </em>motion to exclude evidence of two prior convictions, and in failing to give the jury a separate instruction that it had to find beyond a reasonable doubt that the weapon used at the time of the robbery was a deadly weapon. Without holding an evidentiary hearing, the district court granted summary judgment denying Pilon\u2019s habeas corpus petition.</p>\n<p id=\"b1402-18\">Pil\u00f3n filed a timely appeal and applied for a certificate of probable cause. The district court issued a certificate with respect to the eyewitness identification claim but denied the certificate as to all other claims. A motions panel of this court referred to this panel the question of whether, as a matter of law, a certificate of probable cause may be limited.</p>\n<p id=\"b1403-4\"><page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"1335\">*1335</page-number>ANALYSIS</p>\n<p id=\"b1403-5\">I</p>\n<p id=\"b1403-6\">\n<em>Limited Certificate of Probable Cause</em>\n</p>\n<p id=\"AeWV\">We address an issue of first impression in this circuit: does a district court\u2019s issuance of a limited certificate of probable cause restrict our review only to those issues stated in the certificate? <footnotemark>1</footnotemark> The Third and Sixth Circuits hold that a limitation in a certificate has no legal effect. <em>See United States ex rel. Hickey v. Jeffes, </em>571 F.2d 762, 765 (3d Cir.1978); <em>Houston v. Mintzes, </em>722 F.2d 290 (6th Cir.1983). The Second Circuit holds to the contrary. <em>Barber v. Scully, </em>731 F.2d 1073, 1075 (2d Cir.1984).<footnotemark>2</footnotemark> As the Sixth Circuit stated in <em>Houston,</em></p>\n<blockquote id=\"aqn-dedup-1\">[T]he question as to the legal effect of the attempt by the district court to limit its certificate to specific issues is, we recognize, less than momentous; this is a prime example of a situation in which it may not be of great importance what the law is but it is important that the law be clear.</blockquote>\n<p id=\"b1403-7\"><em>Houston, </em>722 F.2d at 292.</p>\n<p id=\"b1403-8\">We agree with the Third and Sixth Circuits that the scope of our review cannot be limited by a certificate of probable cause. Nothing in the language or legislative history of 28 U.S.C. \u00a7 2253 suggests that Congress intended this provision to permit a judge to limit the issues on appeal. Section 2253 provides that an appeal may not be taken \u201cfrom the <em>final order </em>in a habeas corpus proceeding ... unless the justice or judge who rendered the order or a circuit justice or judge issues a certificate of probable cause\u201d (emphasis added). This language is consistent with the general rule that appeals lie from final judgments or orders, not from determinations of legal issues. <em>See Hickey, </em>571 F.2d at 765; <em>cf. New York City Health and Hospitals Corp. v. Blum, </em>678 F.2d 392, 396-97 (2d Cir.1982) (28 U.S.C. \u00a7 1292(b), which speaks of interlocutory appeal of certain orders, allows appeal of orders, not of issues).</p>\n<p id=\"b1403-13\">Moreover, the purpose of the requirement of a certificate of probable cause is to prevent abuse of the writ through frivolous appeals. <em>Barefoot v. Estelle, </em>463 U.S. 880, 892-93 n. 3, 103 S.Ct. 3383, 3394 n. 3, 77 L.Ed.2d 1090 (1983). To obtain a certificate of probable cause, the petitioner must make a \u201csubstantial showing of the denial of [a] federal right.\u201d <em>Id. </em>at 893, 103 S.Ct. at 3394 <em>(iquoting Stewart v. Beto, </em>454 F.2d 268, 270 n. 2 (5th Cir.1971), cert. <em>denied, </em>406 U.S. 925, 92 S.Ct. 1796, 32 L.Ed.2d 126 (1972)). By issuing a certificate, the district court notifies this court that in its opinion the petitioner is not abusing the writ through frivolous litigation. The requirement of a certificate, therefore, tends to screen out frivolous appeals.<footnotemark>3</footnotemark></p>\n<p id=\"b1404-3\"><page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"1336\">*1336</page-number>To the extent that <em>limited </em>certificates of probable cause represent an effort to eliminate frivolous issues from consideration on appeal, they have little practical effect. A single circuit judge may issue a certificate that dissolves the limited certificate. <em>See </em>28 U.S.C. \u00a7 2253. As the Second Circuit has recognized, circuit judges by statute may broaden the scope of an appeal that was limited by a district judge if it is just under the circumstances. <em>Barber, </em>731 F.2d at 1075; <em>see </em>28 U.S.C. \u00a7 2106; <em>see also Vicaretti, </em>645 F.2d at 102 (limitation in certificate is not jurisdictional and it authoritatively limits issues only when acted upon by a panel of three circuit judges). Also, whenever the district judge denies a request for a certificate of probable cause and the applicant files a notice of appeal, the application is automatically forwarded to the judges of this court for our consideration. Fed.R.App.P. 22(b). Presumably, if the district judge does not deny, but limits the certificate, the application will receive similar treatment: the notice of appeal will be forwarded to this court and will be construed, as it was here, as a request to expand the certificate. Thus, whether the district judge denies or limits a certificate, this court will in any event be called upon to assess the substantiality of the issues. Appellants will likely raise uncertified issues in the hope that we will exercise our authority to broaden the scope of the appeal in the interests of justice, just as they frequently appeal after the district judge denies a certificate entirely.</p>\n<p id=\"b1404-4\">Because we decline to give legal effect to the district court\u2019s limitation in the certificate of probable cause, we must address all of Pilon\u2019s assertions of error in addition to his claim that the eyewitness identifications were improperly admitted.</p>\n<p id=\"b1404-5\">II</p>\n<p id=\"b1404-6\">\n<em>Eyewitness Identification Evidence</em>\n</p>\n<p id=\"b1404-7\">Pil\u00f3n contends the district court erred by granting summary judgment on his challenge to the eyewitness identification procedures without granting an evidentiary hearing and viewing photographs of the pretrial lineup. He claims his identification as the robber was impermissibly suggestive and unreliable. Specifically he argues: (1) he did not sufficiently resemble lineup coparticipants; (2) an officer at the lineup unduly focused the witnesses\u2019 attention on him by interrupting the lineup to adjust tape which had been placed on his face; and (3) the prosecution arranged for the identification witnesses to be present at a pretrial suppression hearing at which Pil\u00f3n was also present.</p>\n<p id=\"b1404-9\">A. <em>Standard of Review</em></p>\n<p id=\"b1404-10\">We review de novo the denial of habeas corpus relief. <em>Tatum v. Christensen, </em>786 F.2d 959, 963 (9th Cir.1986) (per curiam). We must presume the correctness of any underlying state court findings of historical fact. 28 U.S.C. \u00a7 2254(d); <em>Sumner v. Mata, </em>449 U.S. 539, 547, 101 S.Ct. 764, 769, 66 L.Ed.2d 722 (1981); <em>Austad v. Risley, </em>761 F.2d 1348, 1350 (9th Cir.) (en banc), <em>cert. denied, </em>\u2014 U.S. -, 106 S.Ct. 163, 88 L.Ed.2d 135 (1985). The presumption does not apply when one of the defects enumerated in 28 U.S.C. \u00a7 2254(d)(1)-(7) is present or when the district court in a habeas proceeding concludes that the state court finding of fact is not fairly supported by the record. <em>Sumner </em>449 U.S. at 550, 101 S.Ct. at 770; <em>Adamson v. Ricketts, </em>789 F.2d 722, 727-28 n. 5 (9th Cir.1986) (en banc); <em>Austad, </em>761 F.2d at 1350; <em>Bashor v. Risley, </em>730 F.2d 1228, 1232 (9th Cir.), <em>cert. denied, </em>469 U.S. 838, 105 S.Ct. 137, 83 L.Ed.2d 77 (1984).</p>\n<p id=\"b1404-13\">The ultimate question of the constitutionality of pretrial identification procedures is a mixed question of law and fact, <em>Sumner v. Mata, </em>455 U.S. 591, 597, 102 S.Ct. 1303, 1306, 71 L.Ed.2d 480 (1982) (per curiam), which this court reviews de novo. <em>United States v. Bagley, </em>772 F.2d 482, 492 (9th Cir.1985), <em>cert. denied, </em>\u2014 U.S. -, 106 S.Ct. 1215, 89 L.Ed.2d 326 (1986); <em>Ponce v. Cupp, </em>735 F.2d 333, 336 (9th Cir.1984).</p>\n<p id=\"b1404-16\">B. <em>Background</em></p>\n<p id=\"b1404-17\">The lineup witnesses included the two robbery victims (John and Judith Groen), a <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"1337\">*1337</page-number>customer who entered the pharmacy during the robbery (Elsie Vanderpol), a person who worked in an office next to the pharmacy (Thomas Lever), and a construction worker who had been working near the scene of the robbery (James O\u2019Hara). The lineup was conducted in two viewing sessions. The record does not reveal whether any witness identified any lineup participant during the first viewing. The witnesses then requested that tape and gauze be placed over the noses of all the lineup participants because the robber had worn a bandage over his nose at the time of the robbery. That was done and a second lineup viewing was conducted. Each of the participants was asked to step out and turn to the left and then to the right before stepping back into place. As the third man in the lineup was going through this routine, the tape which had been applied to Pilon\u2019s face slipped. Pil\u00f3n was participant number 5. One of the police officers thereupon said: \u201cHold it, hold it, stop everything. This man, Number 5, your tape is falling off.\u201d The officer then walked over to Pil\u00f3n and reapplied the tape to his face. This was done in front of the witnesses to the lineup.<footnotemark>4</footnotemark> After the second lineup viewing, John Groen, one of the victims, unequivocally identified Pil\u00f3n as the robber. His wife, Judith Groen, alternatively identified Pil\u00f3n and another lineup participant. One of the other witnesses tentatively identified Pil\u00f3n as the robber. Of the remaining two witnesses, one identified someone other than Pil\u00f3n and the other did not identify anyone.</p>\n<p id=\"b1405-5\">Forty-nine days after the lineup, and ten days before trial, a pretrial hearing was held on Pilon\u2019s motion to suppress his identification by the lineup witnesses. The prosecution had the lineup witnesses attend that hearing in case they were needed as witnesses. They observed Pil\u00f3n in jail clothing, heard that he had been charged with escape from a prison, and that he had a prior criminal record. The state court at the suppression hearing viewed photographs of the lineup participants which had been taken during the lineup and found that the participants sufficiently resembled one another so as not to render the lineup impermissibly suggestive. Pilon\u2019s motion to suppress was denied. The state court at that proceeding also noted that Pil\u00f3n had suffered no prejudice from the witnesses\u2019 presence at the suppression hearing.</p>\n<p id=\"b1405-8\">At the trial, the Groens, Vanderpol, and O\u2019Hara all positively identified Pil\u00f3n as the robber. It is not disputed that the eyewitnesses\u2019 in-court and pretrial identifications of Pil\u00f3n constituted virtually the entire case against him.</p>\n<p id=\"b1405-9\">C. <em>Photographs</em></p>\n<p id=\"b1405-10\">We address first the argument that the district court erred by failing to view the photographs.</p>\n<p id=\"b1405-11\">The district court had no obligation to view the lineup photographs for dissimilarity among the participants, a question of historical fact which the state trial and appellate courts had resolved, because the photographs were not part of the district court record and because Pilon did not demonstrate any inability to have the photographs produced. <em>Austad, </em>761 F.2d at 1351-55. Indeed, not only did Pil\u00f3n fail to produce the photographs which he claims the district court should have viewed, he opposed the motion of the state defendants to augment the record on appeal before this court with copies of the photographs. The motions panel that heard the motion to augment the record on appeal permitted the photographs to be lodged with the clerk of this court and determined that the merits panel should give such consideration to the photographs as it deemed appropriate. We have viewed the photographs and conclude, as did the state trial court and the state court of appeals, that the defendant <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"1338\">*1338</page-number>and the other lineup participants sufficiently resembled one another so as not to render the lineup impermissibly suggestive.</p>\n<p id=\"b1406-4\">D. <em>Evidentiary Hearing</em></p>\n<p id=\"b1406-5\">In habeas proceedings under 28 U.S.C. \u00a7 2254, an evidentiary hearing is required when: (1) the petitioner\u2019s allegations, if proved, would establish the right to relief (prima facie case); and (2) the state court trier of fact has not, after a full and fair hearing, reliably found the relevant facts. <em>Townsend v. Sain, </em>372 U.S. 293, 312-13, 83 S.Ct. 745, 756-57, 9 L.Ed.2d 770 (1963); <em>Bashor, </em>730 F.2d at 1233.</p>\n<p id=\"b1406-6\">1. <em>Prima Fade Case</em></p>\n<p id=\"b1406-7\">Pilon\u2019s allegations, if proved, would establish the right to relief. In-court identification testimony is inadmissible as a violation of due process whenever: (1) a pretrial encounter is so impermissibly suggestive as to give rise to a very substantial likelihood of irreparable misidentification, <em>Simmons v. United States, </em>390 U.S. 377, 384, 88 S.Ct. 967, 971, 19 L.Ed.2d 1247 (1968); and (2) the identification is not sufficiently reliable to outweigh the corrupting effects of the suggestive procedure. <em>Manson v. Brathwaite, </em>432 U.S. 98, 114, 97 S.Ct. 2243, 2253, 53 L.Ed.2d 140 (1977).</p>\n<p id=\"b1406-8\">2. <em>Reliable Factfinding</em></p>\n<p id=\"b1406-9\">The next question is whether the state court reliably found the relevant facts. The state cannot be deemed to have conducted the full and fair hearing necessary to reliable fact finding if it did not actually reach and decide the issues of fact tendered by the defendant. <em>Townsend, </em>372 U.S. at 313-14, 83 S.Ct. at 757.</p>\n<p id=\"b1406-10\">Pil\u00f3n contends the district court failed to resolve the following factual issues: (1) whether the photographs of the pretrial lineup reveal substantial dissimilarities in appearance between Pil\u00f3n and the others; (2) whether the witnesses made any identifications in the first of the two lineup sessions; (3) whether the witnesses were permitted to discuss their thoughts and impressions among themselves between the two lineups and their choices afterwards; (4) whether the witnesses were present when the officer interrupted the second lineup to adjust the tape on Pilon\u2019s face; (5) whether officers told the witnesses anything about the suspects after the lineup; (6) the nature of any initial description the witnesses gave to the police; and (7) how tentative the witnesses were in their selection.</p>\n<p id=\"b1406-12\">The district court had no obligation to hear evidence on the first and fourth issues mentioned above. As to the first issue, the photographs were not part of the record and Pil\u00f3n did not demonstrate any inability to produce them. <em>Austad, </em>761 F.2d at 1351-55. As to the fourth issue, that was resolved in Pilon\u2019s favor by the state trial court and state court of appeals when they accepted Pilon\u2019s contention that the tape incident had occurred in the lineup witnesses\u2019 presence. Although the state court did not expressly resolve the remaining five factual issues tendered by Pilon, those issues were implicitly resolved against him by the state court\u2019s denial of his suppression motion. As we stated in <em>Knaubert v. Goldsmith, </em>791 F.2d 722 (9th Cir.1986):</p>\n<blockquote id=\"A17\">[N]ot every finding of fact need be stated on the record in infinite detail and clarity. In certain circumstances we will recognize that a factual determination is implicit in the actions taken by a state court. When a state trial court holds a hearing on a motion to suppress evidence and rules on the motion, a federal district court may assume that the state court found the facts necessary to support the state court\u2019s decision, unless there is some indication that the state court applied an incorrect legal standard.</blockquote>\n<p id=\"b1406-13\"><em>Id. </em>at 727.</p>\n<p id=\"b1406-14\">Pilon points to nothing that suggests the state court applied the wrong standard. Indeed, the record shows that both the state trial court and the state court of appeals expressly applied the standard mandated by <em>Simmons, </em>390 U.S. at 384-85, 88 S.Ct. at 971 and determined that the eyewitnesses\u2019 identification of Pil\u00f3n was reliable.</p>\n<p id=\"b1407-4\"><page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"1339\">*1339</page-number>Courts consider the following five factors when determining reliability: (1) the opportunity of the witness to view the criminal at the time of the crime, (2) the witness\u2019s degree of attention, (3) the accuracy of the witness\u2019s prior description, (4) the level of certainty demonstrated at the confrontation, and (5) the length of time between the crime and the confrontation. <em>Manson, </em>432 U.S. at 114, 97 S.Ct. at 2253; <em>Neil v. Biggers, </em>409 U.S. 188, 199-200, 93 S.Ct. 375, 382, 34 L.Ed.2d 401 (1972).</p>\n<p id=\"b1407-5\">The record reflects that the two victims, John and Judith Groen, viewed the robber for almost five minutes at close range in well-lighted conditions while he commanded their attention. John Groen testified he made a special effort to remember the robber\u2019s features. He also identified Pil\u00f3n unequivocally at the lineup only one week after the robbery. Judith Groen initially was less certain in her identification of Pil\u00f3n, but \u201c ... after I got home there was no more doubt.\u201d (Transcript of state court proceedings, pages 32-33). The witness O\u2019Hara tentatively identified Pil\u00f3n at the lineup and positively identified him at trial. He had been approximately twenty feet from the robber and had seen him twice, once headed toward the pharmacy and once headed away. The pharmacy customer, Vanderpol, saw the robber briefly and while she did not identify him at the lineup, she identified him in court at the time of trial.</p>\n<p id=\"b1407-6\">Because the record fairly supports the conclusion that the identifications were reliable, the district court correctly denied relief without a hearing even after assuming for the purpose of argument that the encounter at the suppression hearing was suggestive. <em>See United States v. Love, </em>746 F.2d 477, 478 (9th Cir.1984) (per cu-riam) (recognizing that court may assume suggestiveness arguendo and review reliability); <em>Ponce, </em>735 F.2d at 336 (assuming suggestiveness and reviewing reliability).</p>\n<p id=\"b1407-9\">Ill</p>\n<p id=\"b1407-10\">\n<em>Motion In Limine</em>\n</p>\n<p id=\"b1407-11\">Pilon contends that by denying his motion <em>in limine </em>to exclude evidence of prior convictions the trial court effectively deprived him of his constitutional right to testify in his own behalf.<footnotemark>5</footnotemark> Our review of the district court\u2019s determination of this question of law is de novo. <em>United States v. McConney, </em>728 F.2d 1195, 1201 (9th Cir.) (en banc), <em>cert. denied, </em>469 U.S. 824, 105 S.Ct. 101, 83 L.Ed.2d 46 (1984). We agree with the district court that Pil\u00f3n was procedurally barred from raising this issue in his habeas petition.</p>\n<p id=\"b1407-12\">Pilon moved <em>in limine </em>to exclude evidence of prior convictions. A criminal motions judge declined to rule on the motion in advance of trial, noting that the issue was \u201cto be handled at trial because it ... would be more appropriately handled by the Trial Judge than the Criminal Motions Department.\u201d Pil\u00f3n never renewed the motion. At trial he declined to testify in his own behalf. The state court of appeals refused to review Pilon\u2019s challenge to the denial of his motion <em>in limine, </em>stating that under <em>State v. Wilson, </em>29 Wash.App. 895, 626 P.2d 998 (1981), by failing at trial to renew his objection to the denial of the motion, Pilon had failed to preserve the issue for appeal.</p>\n<p id=\"b1407-13\">A prisoner who under state law has waived the right to appeal a constitutional claim may not obtain federal habeas corpus relief on that issue without demon<page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"1340\">*1340</page-number>strating cause for, and actual prejudice from, the default. <em>Reed v.

Koloske, </em>100 Wash.2d 889, 896, 676 P.2d 456, 459-61 (1984), the Washington Supreme Court resolved an apparent conflict in the decisions of that state\u2019s intermediate appellate courts and held that unless the trial court informs the defendant that further objections at trial are necessary, the court\u2019s denial of a motion <em>in limine </em>to exclude evidence of prior convictions is final and the defendant has a standing objection to the denial. This rule applies when the trial judge makes a clear, nontentative ruling. <em>State v. Latham, </em>100 Wash.2d 59, 65, 667 P.2d 56, 59 (1983). When, however, the court refuses to rule on the motion before trial, the movant must raise the issue at the appropriate time during trial in order to preserve the issue for review. If, as here, the defendant decides not to testify following the denial of his motion <em>in limine, </em>the defendant must renew his motion at the time of trial and make an offer of proof on the record to preserve any error for appellate review. <em>Koloske, </em>100 Wash.2d at 896, 676 P.2d at 461.</p>\n<p id=\"b1408-7\">Pilon\u2019s counsel failed to renew his motion <em>in limine </em>at trial and failed to make an offer of proof. Pil\u00f3n argues, however, that his counsel may have had cause to believe the court\u2019s pretrial decision on his motion was final and that the issue was therefore preserved. He suggests that any error on his part in failing to preserve the issue for appeal was justified by confusing and inconsistent case law on the issue in the state of Washington at the time of his trial. His trial preceded <em>Kelly </em>and <em>Koloske.</em></p>\n<p id=\"b1408-8\">Pil\u00f3n may not rely on the claimed former inconsistency in Washington law to establish cause for his failure to preserve this issue for appeal. The inconsistency had to do with whether the denial of a motion <em>in limine </em>was a final ruling that could be challenged on appeal without further evidentiary objections at trial. Washington courts in some cases had suggested that all rulings on motions <em>in limine </em>were tentative and that defendants had to renew their objection to the denial of such motions in order to preserve the issue for review. <em>State v. Austin, </em>34 Wash.App. 625, 627, 662 P.2d 872, 874 (1983), <em>aff'd on other grounds sub nom State v. Koloske, </em>100 Wash.2d 889, 676 P.2d 456 (1984); <em>State v. Wilson, </em>29 Wash.App. 895, 898, 626 P.2d 998, 1001 (1981). Other Washington appellate courts had held that some motions <em>in limine </em>could and should be finally decided before trial, and defendants did not have to renew their objections to rulings on those motions or to evidence admitted as a result of such rulings. <em>State v. Moore, </em>33 Wash.App. 55, 59-60, 651 P.2d 765, 768 (1982); <em>State v. Latham, </em>30 Wash.App. 776, 780, 638 P.2d 592, 595 (1981), <em>aff'd, </em>100 Wash.2d 59, 667 P.2d 56 (1983). <em>See Kelly, </em>102 Wash.2d at 191, 685 P.2d at 568 (recognizing conflict).</p>\n<p id=\"b1408-9\">Here, however, Pilon can find no comfort even in the line of cases stating the more generous <em>Moore-Latham </em>standard, because no judge ever ruled on his <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"1341\">*1341</page-number>motion.<footnotemark>6</footnotemark> We know of no Washington case holding that when a judge specifically declines to rule on a motion <em>in limine </em>and the defendant does not renew the motion at trial, the judge\u2019s inaction can be construed as a final denial and the defendant has preserved the issue for review. This rule would obviously make no sense, because there would be no ruling to review.</p>\n<p id=\"b1409-5\">Because Pilon did not renew his motion <em>in limine </em>at trial and has failed to show cause for his failure to do so, we need not consider whether he suffered prejudice from the alleged error. <em>See Engle, </em>456 U.S. at 129, 102 S.Ct. at 1572. We conclude that Pilon\u2019s waiver under state law of the right to appeal the issue precludes federal habeas corpus review.</p>\n<p id=\"b1409-6\">IV</p>\n<p id=\"b1409-7\">\n<em>Failure to Give Deadly Weapon Instruction</em>\n</p>\n<p id=\"b1409-8\">Pilon finally contends that the state trial court denied him due process by failing to give a separate jury instruction that to enhance his sentence for being armed with a deadly weapon during commission of the robbery, the jury had to find beyond a reasonable doubt that he was armed at the time of the robbery with a weapon which in fact was a deadly weapon.</p>\n<p id=\"b1409-9\">A. <em>Pilon\u2019s Failure to Request Instruction</em></p>\n<p id=\"b1409-10\">Although Pilon failed to request this separate instruction at trial, he is not procedurally barred from raising the issue. Under Washington law, failure to give this separate deadly weapon instruction is an error of state constitutional dimension and may be raised for the first time on appeal. <em>State v. Hall, </em>95 Wash.2d 536, 627 P.2d 101, 103 (1981). We decline to apply the procedural default rule of <em>Wainwright v. Sykes, </em>433 U.S. 72, 87-91, 97 S.Ct. 2497, 2506-08, 53 L.Ed.2d 594 (1977), when under state law constitutional errors can be raised for the first time on appeal. <em>See Huffman v. Ricketts, </em>750 F.2d 798, 800-01 (9th Cir.1984); <em>Quigg v. Crist, </em>616 F.2d 1107, 1111 n. 4 (9th Cir.), <em>cert. denied, </em>449 U.S. 922, 101 S.Ct. 323, 66 L.Ed.2d 150 (1980).</p>\n<p id=\"b1409-13\">B. <em>The Instructions and Verdict</em></p>\n<p id=\"b1409-14\">The jury was instructed by jury instruction No. 11:</p>\n<blockquote id=\"b1409-15\">To convict the defendant, Gary Van Pi-Ion, of the crime of robbery in the first degree, as alleged in Count I, each of the following elements of the crime must be proved beyond a reasonable doubt:</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b1409-16\">(5) That in the commission of these acts or in immediate flight therefrom the defendant, or the accomplice was armed with a deadly weapon or displayed what appeared to be a firearm or other deadly weapon;</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b1409-17\">If you find from the evidence that each of these elements have been proved beyond a reasonable doubt, then it will be your duty to return a verdict of guilty.</blockquote>\n<p id=\"b1409-18\">The jury was provided with a special verdict form in which the jurors were asked to determine whether, if they found Pil\u00f3n guilty, he was actually armed with a deadly weapon. The jury found Pil\u00f3n guilty of two counts of armed robbery and specially found that he had been armed with a deadly weapon. Pilon\u2019s sentence was enhanced under Rev. Code Wash. \u00a7 9.95.040 based on the jury\u2019s special verdict that he was armed with a deadly weapon. The state court of appeals determined that the failure to give the separate \u201cbeyond a reasonable doubt\u201d jury instruction as to the finding that Pil\u00f3n was armed with a deadly weapon at the time of the robbery was harmless error because there was no dispute that a deadly <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"1342\">*1342</page-number>weapon in fact had been used. The state court of appeals stated:</p>\n<blockquote id=\"b1410-4\">Here, both robbery victims testified that Pil\u00f3n had been armed with a gun. The pharmacist testified he was familiar with firearms from his military training and recognized the gun as a .38 calibre pistol. Pilon\u2019s co-defendant testified only that she did not see a gun from her vantage point or know that a gun was going to be used. \u00d1o evidence controverts the victims\u2019 testimony that the male robber was armed, nor was the fact disputed at trial. In the absence of any evidence that would create a reasonable doubt about the presence of the gun, failure to instruct the jury on the state\u2019s burden of proof was harmless error.</blockquote>\n<p id=\"b1410-5\">C. <em>No Due Process Denial</em></p>\n<p id=\"b1410-6\">A state prisoner may obtain federal habeas corpus relief only if he is held in custody in violation of the Constitution, laws, or treaties of the United States. <em>Engle v. Isaac, </em>456 U.S. 107, 119, 102 S.Ct. 1558, 1567, 71 L.Ed.2d 783 (1982); <em>Gutierrez v. Griggs, </em>695 F.2d 1195, 1197 (9th Cir.1983); 28 U.S.C. \u00a7 2254(a). Claims that merely challenge the correctness of jury instructions under state law cannot reasonably be construed to allege a deprivation of federal rights. <em>Givens v. Housewright, </em>786 F.2d 1378, 1381 (9th Cir.1986); <em>Gutierrez, </em>695 F.2d at 1197. To prove a due process violation based on jury instructions, a habeas petitioner must show that the \u201cinstruction by itself ... infected the entire trial....\u201d <em>Henderson v. Kibbe, </em>431 U.S. 145, 154, 97 S.Ct. 1730, 1736, 52 L.Ed.2d 203 (1977) <em>(quoting Cupp v. Naughten, </em>414 U.S. 141, 147, 94 S.Ct. 396, 400, 38 L.Ed.2d 368 (1973)); <em>see Camitsch v. Risley, </em>705 F.2d 351, 355 (9th Cir.1983) (instruction that renders trial fundamentally unfair justifies habeas relief).

The failure to give that instruction did not infect Pilon\u2019s trial nor render it fundamentally unfair. <em>Cam-itsch, </em>705 F.2d at 355; <em>see Henderson, </em>431 U.S. at 154, 97 S.Ct. at 1736.</p>\n<p id=\"b1410-11\">The judgment is AFFIRMED.</p>\n<footnote label=\"1\">\n<p id=\"b1403-9\">. Although we have at least twice limited our review to those issues to which a district court has limited a certificate of probable cause, we have not squarely addressed the issue of whether we are bound by such a limitation. <em>See United States ex rel.

Wilson, </em>363 F.2d 543, 545 (9th Cir.1966). <em>But see Choate, </em>363 F.2d at 546 (Hamley, J., concurring) (expressing view that certificate of probable cause may not effectively limit issues on appeal because certificate serves to confer jurisdiction, not to specify issues).</p>\n</footnote>\n<footnote label=\"2\">\n<p id=\"b1403-10\">.
