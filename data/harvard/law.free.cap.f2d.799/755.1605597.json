This case calls upon us to review the Federal Energy Regulatory Commission\u2019s interpretation of a contract executed in 1957 concerning the sale of electric power in Massachusetts. For the reasons that follow, we defer to the Commission\u2019s interpretation of the contract and deny the petition for review.</p>\n<p id=\"b832-3\"><page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"756\">*756</page-number>I</p>\n<p id=\"b832-4\">In the mountains of Western Massachusetts is situated the 148-megawatt Mt. Tom electric generating facility. The plant is owned and operated by the Holyoke Water Power Company (HWP). HWP sells the entire output of the Mt. Tom plant to its wholly-owned subsidiary, Holyoke Power and Electric Company (HP &amp; E), which under the terms of the same agreement sells 39% of Mt. Tom\u2019s output back to its parent company, HWP. Under a separate contract, HP &amp; E sells 23% of the Mt. Tom facility\u2019s output to Western Massachusetts Electric Company, an affiliate of the two Holyoke Companies (Holyoke) and a wholly-owned subsidiary of Northeast Utilities situated to the south in Hartford, Connecticut. Under the third and last contract, HP &amp; E sells the remaining 38% of Mt. Tom\u2019s output to New England Power Co., which is neither an affiliate nor otherwise a part of the Northeast Utilities system. In the background is the final member of the cast of characters, the First National Bank of Boston. First National is a party to each of the three power contracts as trustee under a mortgage indenture and deed of trust between Mt. Tom\u2019s owner, HWP, and the Old Colony Trust Company, which provided the original construction financing for the facility and to whose duties and privileges First National has succeeded.</p>\n<p id=\"b832-5\">Each of the power contracts prescribes monthly rates based on a demand charge and an energy charge.<footnotemark>2</footnotemark> Thirty pages of the contract are devoted to specifying the components of the cost-related formula for determining those charges. The contract formula rate proved satisfactory to all the parties from the inception of Mt. Tom\u2019s operations in 1960 until the last day of July 1984,<footnotemark>3</footnotemark> when Holyoke filed a proposed unilateral rate increase with the Commission. Holyoke justified its proposed rate on the ground that the rate formula agreed upon by the parties caused it \u201cto earn an inadequate rate of return.\u201d Brief for Petitioners at 11.</p>\n<p id=\"b832-8\">While the affiliated companies all fell into line with respect to the price hike, as did First National as trustee, New England Power objected. In its filings of protest, New England Power contended that Ho-lyoke\u2019s proposed unilateral rate increase was not permitted under the contract and was thus illegal under the <em>Mobile-Sierra </em>doctrine. First, New England Power argued that the contract provides for a specified rate formula not subject to unilateral modification by Holyoke. Second, it argued that the contract specifically provides for only one situation, not applicable, in which the seller could effect a unilateral rate increase. In response, Holyoke argued that the contract authorized the challenged price hike by virtue of a contractual provision expressly incorporating Massachusetts law, including a provision of state law permitting unilateral rate increases subject to temporary suspension and subsequent modification by the governing regulatory authority.</p>\n<p id=\"b832-9\">Acting with dispatch, the Commission suspended the proposed rate increases pending review of the contract in light of the <em>Mobile-Sierra </em>arguments advanced by New England Power. Shortly thereafter, the Commission adopted an interpretation of the contract that partly incorporated the competing positions of both Holyoke and New England Power. The Commission agreed with New England Power that the rate formula contained in the contract would, standing alone, prohibit any rate changes not agreed upon by the parties. But the Commission also agreed with Ho-lyoke that the contractual reference to state law reflected the parties\u2019 intent that the contract rate be subject to review and determination by the pertinent regulatory body. The Commission declined, however, <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"757\">*757</page-number>to embrace Holyoke\u2019s position that the contractual reference to state law conferred upon Holyoke the right to change rates <em>prior </em>to approval of the governing regulatory body. On the heels of the Commission\u2019s denial of rehearing in January 1985, Holyoke filed the present petition for review.</p>\n<p id=\"b833-4\">II</p>\n<p id=\"b833-5\">Holyoke\u2019s principal argument before us is that the Commission misinterpreted the significance of the reference to Massachusetts law in section 6.06(a) of the contract.<footnotemark>4</footnotemark> It is undisputed, however, that in construing this contractual provision FERC applied the proper legal principle that \u201cstate law is relevant only to the extent intended by the parties.\u201d Joint Appendix (J.A.) at 219 (Supplemental Order at 4); <em>see Appalachian Power Co. v. FPC, </em>529 F.2d 342, 347 n. 35 (D.C.Cir.), <em>cert. denied, </em>429 U.S. 816, 97 S.Ct. 58, 50 L.Ed.2d 76 (1976).</p>\n<p id=\"b833-6\">The Commission crafted a reasonable construction of section 6.06(a) in rejecting Holyoke\u2019s view that this provision incorporated Massachusetts\u2019 procedural mechanism permitting unilateral rate increases. FERC concluded that the reference in section 6.06(a) to \u201cChapter 164 of the General Laws of Massachusets\u201d triggered the application of section 94A of that chapter. As Holyoke concedes, the Commission\u2019s conclusion in this respect was fully justified since under Chapter 164 contracts such as those at issue here are expressly governed by section 94A. <em>See </em>Brief for Petitioners at 21. The Commission also adopted Ho-lyoke\u2019s position (and rejected New England Power\u2019s contrary view) that section 6.06(a) of the agreement subjected the contract rate to review and determination by the regulatory body having jurisdiction. In our view, no other reading of section 6.06(a) was possible in light of the clear language in that provision mandating regulatory oversight and in light of the requirement in section 94A of Chapter 164 that utility contracts provide for such oversight or else be rendered void.</p>\n<p id=\"b833-12\">Holyoke faults FERC, however, for failing to draw the inference that the contractual reference to Chapter 164 also unequivocally evinces the intent of the parties to subject the contractual rate formula to section 94 of that chapter, which provides for unilateral rate increases effective upon filing (subject to temporary suspension and later alteration by the regulatory authority). But, as the Commission emphasized in both its orders under review, section 6.06 of the contract by its express terms \u201conly incorporates the provisions of Chapter 164 \u2018insofar as the same <em>may </em>be applicable to this agreement.\u2019 \u201d J.A. at 219 (Supplemental Order at 4) (emphasis added by Commission); <em>see also </em>J.A. at 236 (Order Denying <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"758\">*758</page-number>Rehearing at 2). Moreover, Holyoke expressly conceded before the Commission and this court that the requirement for regulatory oversight in section 94A of Chapter 164 may be satisfied by subjecting the contract price to review and determination under <em>either </em>section 94 or section 93. <em>See </em>Brief for Petitioners at 22-24, 27, 29; J.A. at 197, 225.<footnotemark>5</footnotemark> Holyoke\u2019s admission that Massachusetts law permitted \u201cthe parties [to] include Section 93 as the only rate review mechanism in their contract,\u201d Brief for Petitioners at 27, is quite significant because Section 93 provides for rate changes effective only upon regulatory approval. Thus, this case is entirely distinguishable from those in which the contract incorporated state law and state law allowed for only <em>one </em>type of filing. <em>Cf. Richmond Power &amp; Light v. FPC, </em>481 F.2d 490, 500 (D.C.Cir.) (finding contractual reference to state law controlling on issue of whether utility could unilaterally raise rates when state law provided for one rate review procedure), <em>cert. denied, </em>414 U.S. 1068, 94 S.Ct. 578, 38 L.Ed.2d 473 (1973).</p>\n<p id=\"b834-7\">Under these circumstances, the Commission quite reasonably looked to the remainder of the agreement to determine whether the parties intended to incorporate section 94. As the Commission correctly observed, the agreement contains no provision authorizing Holyoke to file rate increases with an immediate effective date (after notice and suspension) whenever it chooses. The absence of such a provision is not surprising in view of the elaborate fixed rate formula set out in the contract. Rather, section 6.06(b) of the agreement allows Ho-lyoke to file a rate increase with an immediate effective date only when the contract rate has been reduced by government order and only in an amount not to exceed the reduction.<footnotemark>6</footnotemark> Those conditions, as all readily <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"759\">*759</page-number>admit, are not present here. As a result, we are persuaded by the conclusion of the Commission that its textual analysis of section 6.06(a) was \u201cbolstered\u201d by the specific unilateral-increase vehicle expressly agreed to by the parties in section 6.06(b). J.A. at 220 (Supplemental Order at 5).</p>\n<p id=\"b835-4\">In our view, therefore, section 6.06(a) of the contract can reasonably be interpreted to provide for the regulatory oversight required by section 94A of applicable state law without granting Holyoke the right to effect a unilateral modification of the rate formula set forth with great detail elsewhere in the contract. <em>Cf. Kansas Cities v. FERC, </em>723 F.2d 82, 88 (D.C.Cir.1983) (contractual provisions subjecting agreed-upon rates to regulatory oversight are generally construed to authorize rate changes upon approval of the Commission applying a \u201cjust and reasonable\u201d standard). Although Holyoke\u2019s more expansive interpretation of section 6.06(a) may also be reasonable, we nonetheless cannot overturn a Commission interpretation that is, without doubt, \u201camply supported both factually and legally.\u201d<footnotemark>7</footnotemark> <em>Gulf States Utilities Co. v.

The dissent would grant Holyoke\u2019s petition for review on the ground that the Commission failed to recognize that Holyoke\u2019s own interpretation of the statute was, in point of fact, erroneous. Dissent at 765-766. We do not, however, reach the merits of the dissent\u2019s statutory analysis. This court lacks jurisdiction to reverse the Commission on the basis of an error raised by the court <em>sua sponte </em>if the error was not \"urged\" before the Commission in the rehearing application. 16 U.S.C. \u00a7 825/(b) (1982); <em>see, e.g., Federal Power Comtn\u2019n v. Colorado Interstate Gas Co., </em>348 U.S. 492, 498-99, 75 S.Ct. 467, 471, 99 L.Ed. 583 (1955) (construing identical provision in section 19(b) of the Natural Gas Act); <em>Rhode Island Consumers\u2019 Council v. Federal Power Comm\u2019n, </em>504 F.2d 203, 212 (D.C.Cir. 1974) (same). <em>A fortiori, </em>we may not reverse the Commission for relying on petitioners\u2019 own interpretation of Massachusetts law.</p>\n<p id=\"b834-5\">Although this point was never argued by petitioners, the dissent also chooses to elucidate at length on its conclusion that \"no utility can initiate a rate change under \u00a7 93.\" Dissent <em>infra, </em>at 770 (emphasis deleted). Even assuming this conclusion is correct, we believe it provides no basis for reversing the portion of the Commission\u2019s decision which is before us. If rate increases cannot be initiated by a utility under section 93, the Commission arguably erred by allowing Holyoke to seek a prospective rate increase from the Commission. But as all the parties and the dissent recognize, \u201d[t]his important ruling ... is not challenged on appeal.\u201d Dissent at 764; <em>see also </em>Reply Brief for Petitioners at vii n. 4.</p>\n<p id=\"Agpf\">The dissent fears that our failure to reach out and decide these issues may create \"precedent that saddles the agency, the reviewing court, and perhaps even future litigants with an incorrect construction of the statute.\u201d Dissent at 769. To the contrary, our express refusal to resolve issues on which the dissent opines creates no precedent except for that of deference to the statutory bar on judicial resolution of errors not urged before the agency. Of course, our decision will not bar the Commission from considering the points raised by the dissent if they are presented in a future filing request. Moreover, the dissent wrongly assumes that a court reviewing an administrative decision must resolve all issues of pure law arguably bearing on the correctness of that decision. For example, under settled principles a court will not consider legal bases for affirming an agency\u2019s decision that were not relied upon in the agency's decision. <em>SEC v. Chenery, </em>318 U.S. 80, 63 S.Ct. 454, 87 L.Ed. 626 (1943). The dissent recognizes as much when it refuses to consider New England Power\u2019s arguments that specific language in sections 94 and 94A contradicts Holyoke\u2019s view that section 94 authorizes unilateral rate increases for purposes of this type of contract. <em>See </em>Brief for New England Power at 14, 19.</p>\n</footnote>\n<footnote label=\"6\">\n<p id=\"b834-9\">. Holyoke argues that the office of section 6.06(b) was exceedingly limited in nature, aimed it is said at protecting the trustee \u2014 First National \u2014 by securing New England Power\u2019s express waiver of the right to contest the specific sort of unilateral hike envisioned by that subsection. Assuming this waiver theory should not be avoided as contrary to public policy, <em>cf. Papago Tribal Utility Auth. v. FERC, </em>723 F.2d 950, <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"759\">*759</page-number>954 (D.C.Cir.1983), <em>cert. denied, </em>467 U.S. 1241, 104 S.Ct. 3511, 82 L.Ed.2d 820 (1984), neither the plain language of the provision nor the contract as a whole requires such an interpretation. At any rate, we cannot reject the Commission\u2019s reasonable interpretation of section 6.06(b) because Holyoke offers a plausible, albeit less than compelling, alternative. <em>See United Gas Pipe Line Co. v. Memphis Light, Gas &amp; Water Div., </em>358 U.S. 103, 114-15, 79 S.Ct. 194, 200-01, 3 L.Ed.2d 153 (1958); <em>Kansas Cities v.

We recognize full well that the task of interpretation is rendered all the more difficult by the considerable passage of time since the contracts were framed and the rather different legal milieu obtaining then. Nevertheless, the difficulty of the task of divining the parties\u2019 intent under changed circumstances is all the more reason for this court to defer \"to the judgment of the expert agency that deals with agreements of this sort on a daily basis.\u201d <em>Kansas Cities, </em>723 F.2d at 87.</p>\n</footnote>\n</opinion>\n<opinion data-order=\"12\" data-type=\"opinion\" id=\"x999-2\" type=\"dissent\">\n<author id=\"b835-8\">MacKINNON, Senior Circuit Judge</author>\n<p id=\"afv-dedup-0\">(dissenting):</p>\n<p id=\"b835-9\">The Federal Energy Regulatory Commission (the \u201cCommission\u201d) interpreted the power contract between Holyoke Water Power Co. and Holyoke Power &amp; Electric Company (\u201cHolyoke\u201d) and New England Power Co. (\u201cNew England\u201d), to permit Ho-lyoke to initiate rate changes upon a filing with the Commission. However, the Commission held that such rate changes could not be obtained under \u00a7 205 of the Federal Power Act, which authorizes unilateral filings, but only under \u00a7 206 following a hearing and order of the Commission. The Commission achieved this result by a bizarre construction of the provision of the contract that incorporates the public utility laws of Massachusetts and by ignoring the intent of the parties that is obvious from the sections of the Massachusetts statute that are incorporated into the contract.<footnotemark>1</footnotemark> The majority opinion adopts the Commission\u2019s construction of the contract. I therefore dissent.</p>\n<p id=\"b835-10\">I. Background</p>\n<p id=\"b835-11\">A. <em>Federal Statutory Background</em></p>\n<p id=\"b835-12\">The Federal Power Act provides that utilities may obtain rate increases by either of two methods. First, \u00a7 205<footnotemark>2</footnotemark> of the Act <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"760\">*760</page-number>authorizes utilities unilaterally to file proposed rate schedules with the Commission. The Commission may approve the rate to become effective immediately, or it may, upon complaint or upon its own initiative, suspend the operation of the schedule for up to five months, pending the Commission\u2019s hearing and decision on the validity of the proposed rate. After the suspension period the rate goes into effect subject to refund if the Commission eventually determines the rate increase to be excessive.</p>\n<p id=\"b836-4\">The other method of obtaining a rate increase is prescribed by \u00a7 206.<footnotemark>3</footnotemark> Under this section, the Commission must first hold a hearing, in which it finds and determines the \u201cjust and reasonable\u201d rate. The rate change is effective only upon order of the Commission.</p>\n<p id=\"b836-5\">Both of the above methods require final approval of the rate by the Commission. However, a utility ordinarily may obtain revenue from a rate increase <em>sooner </em>under \u00a7 205 than under \u00a7 206, because currently the hearing procedure generally takes longer than the maximum five-month suspension period. Since rates cannot be imposed retroactively, if the \u00a7 206 procedure is followed the utility will never secure an increase for the period it takes the Commission to hold the hearing and announce its decision, even though the rate is found to be just and reasonable as of the earlier date of the financial data filed with the request for the rate increase.</p>\n<p id=\"b836-7\">B. <em>The Contractual Background</em></p>\n<p id=\"b836-8\">Under the <em>Mobile-Sierra </em>doctrine<footnotemark>4</footnotemark> the statutory method to be followed by the Commission is controlled by the terms of the contract between a utility and its customers. It is thus necessary to examine the 1957 power contract between Holyoke and the New England Power Company. This examination brings out two provisions of the contract, set forth in subsections (a) and (b) of \u00a7 6.06, that the Commission found to be relevant.</p>\n<p id=\"b836-9\">Section 6.06(a) of the contract incorporates Massachusetts utility law:</p>\n<blockquote id=\"b836-10\">[T]he <em>prices </em>to be paid for electricity to be delivered hereunder ... <em>shall </em>be subject to review and <em>determination </em>by the Massachusetts Department of Public Utilities in <em>any proceeding </em>brought under <em>Chapter 164 </em>of the General Laws of Massachusetts, as amended, <em>to the extent provided for and in accordance with the provisions of said chapter, insofar as the same may be applicable to this agreement.</em></blockquote>\n<p id=\"b836-11\">(J.A. 86) (emphasis added).</p>\n<p id=\"b836-12\">Section 6.06(b) establishes the procedures to be followed in the event the utility requests a rate increase after a mandatory rate <em>reduction:</em></p>\n<blockquote id=\"b836-13\">If any <em>reduction in the charges for electricity </em>that would otherwise be payable hereunder is required, at any time <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"761\">*761</page-number>or from time to time, by law or by order of any governmental regulatory body having jurisdiction, including courts, HWP [Holyoke Water Power Co.] and/or HP &amp; E [Holyoke] <em>shall be free to take any steps necessary or appropriate in accordance with the then laws and rules, regulations and orders of governmental regulatory bodies having jurisdiction, including the filing of new rate schedules, </em>in order to receive from NEP-CO [New England] for the electricity sold hereunder amounts <em>no greater than those which would be payable by NEP-CO in the absence of such reduction </em>and such amounts shall be paid by NEP-CO.</blockquote>\n<p id=\"b837-4\"><em>Id. </em>(emphasis added).</p>\n<p id=\"b837-5\">The provision of \u00a7 6.06(a) of the contract that the \u201cprices to be paid for electricity ... <em>shall </em>be subject to review and <em>determination </em>by the Massachusetts Department of Public Utilities in <em>any proceeding </em>brought under Chapter 164 of the General Laws of Massachusetts,\u201d as its plain language indicates, incorporates <em>all </em>the stat-\u00fates that may be relevant to \u201cany proceeding brought under Chapter 164\u201d and requires a thorough examination of that regulatory statute.</p>\n<p id=\"b837-6\">1. The Referenced Statutes of Massachusetts</p>\n<p id=\"b837-7\">Chapter 164 is a comprehensive compilation of Massachusetts law regulating companies selling natural gas and electricity. Three sections are particularly relevant here because of the \u201cproceedings\u201d they authorize. Section 94A provides:</p>\n<blockquote id=\"b837-8\">No gas or electric company shall hereafter enter into a contract for the purchase of gas or electricity covering a period in excess of one year ... unless such contract contains a provision subjecting the price to be paid ... to review and determination in <em>any proceeding </em>brought under <em>section ninety-three or ninety-four </em>____ In any such proceeding the department may review and determine the price to be thereafter paid for gas or electricity under a contract containing said provision for review.</blockquote>\n<p id=\"b837-9\">Mass.Gen.Laws Ann. ch. 164, \u00a7 94A (1976) (emphasis added).</p>\n<p id=\"b837-10\">The clear intent of this section of the statute is to authorize and require <em>all </em>power contracts to provide for review and <em>determination </em>under the procedures prescribed both by \u00a7 93 <em>and </em>\u00a7 94.

Sands, Sutherland Statutory Construction \u00a7 21.14 at 127, and cases cited at 127-34, n. 6 (4th ed. 1985). The Commission so interprets \u00a7 94 when it applies that statute in conformance with \u00a7 6.06(b) of <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"762\">*762</page-number>the contract. It was to comply with the requirement of \u00a7 94A that the parties agreed to incorporate Chapter 164 in its entirety into contract. Thus <em>both </em>sections are part of the contract.</p>\n<p id=\"b838-4\">2. Section 93 of the Massachusetts Statute</p>\n<p id=\"aob-dedup-1\">Section 93 generally regulates consumer complaints. It provides that the Massachusetts Attorney General, local officials, and consumers may complain to the Massachusetts Department (the Department may also act upon its own motion) of the price or service, and the Department after hearing may order a \u201creduction or change in the price\u201d or service. Specifically the state provides:</p>\n<blockquote id=\"b838-5\">On written <em>complaint of the attorney general, of the mayor of a city or the selectmen of a town </em>... <em>or of twenty customers thereof, </em>either as to the quality or price of the gas or electricity sold and delivered, the department shall ... give a public hearing to such complainant and said company, and after such hearing may order any <em>reduction or change </em>in the price ... or an improvement in the quality [of the gas or electricity]____ Such an order may likewise be made by the Department ... upon its own motion. <em>The price or prices fixed by any such order shall not thereafter be changed by said company except as provided in section ninety-four.</em></blockquote>\n<p id=\"b838-8\"><em>Id. </em>\u00a7 93 (emphasis added). Holyoke, as with any private utility, is not a public person or a consumer and hence is not authorized by this section to initiate a rate increase. The last sentence of \u00a7 93, which is italicized above, is very significant to this case. It authorizes a utility to file for a rate increase immediately after the Department has ordered a rate reduction, provided, that any change in the rate thereafter <em>must </em>proceed under \u00a7 94. The plain import of the last sentence of \u00a7 93 is to recognize that \u00a7 94 provides the general procedure for utilities to seek rate increases.</p>\n<p id=\"b838-9\">3. Section 94 of the Massachusetts Statute</p>\n<p id=\"b838-10\">The full text of \u00a7 94 is set forth in the margin so that there may be no doubt about its full meaning.<footnotemark>5</footnotemark> The following ex<page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"763\">*763</page-number>tracts from \u00a7 94 provide that utilities seeking a rate increase shall proceed in a manner substantially similar to the <em>unilateral </em>method provided by \u00a7 205. In fact, this is the <em>only </em>method provided by the statute for a utility to initiate a rate increase. However, the Department if it intervenes \u201cbefore ... such contract has become effective\u201d may cause a rate increase to be granted only after a public hearing, similar to \u00a7 206.</p>\n<blockquote id=\"b839-4\">... Rates, prices and charges in [existing rate schedules filed by electric companies] may, from time to time, be changed by any such company by filing a schedule setting forth the changed rates, prices and charges, but until the effective date of any such change no different rate, price or charge shall be charged, received or collected by the company filing such a schedule from those specified in the schedule then in effect____ Whenever the department receives notice of any changes proposed to be made in any schedule filed under this chapter which represent a general increase in rates, prices and charges for gas or electric service, it shall notify the attorney general of the same forthwith, and shall thereafter hold a public hearing and make an investigation as to the propriety of such proposed changes after first causing notice of the time, place and the subject matter of such hearing to be published at least twenty-one days before such hearing in such local newspapers as the department may select. <em>Unless the department otherwise authorizes, the rates, prices and charges set forth in such a schedule shall not become effective until the first day of the month next after the expiration of fourteen days from the filing thereof....</em></blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b839-9\">The department, either upon complaint or upon its own motion, may investigate the propriety of any proposed rate, price or charge and may, pending such investigation and decision thereon, by order served upon the company affected thereby, suspend the taking effect thereof, from time to time, but not for a period longer than ten months beyond the time when such rate, price or charge would otherwise become effective____</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b839-10\">Unless the department otherwise orders, all contracts for the sale of gas or electricity by gas or electric companies, except contracts for sale by a company whose sole business in this commonwealth is the supply of electricity in bulk, shall be filed with the department and shall not become effective until thirty days after filing. <em>The department may investigate the propriety of any such contract, both before and after such contract has become effective, </em>and may, after notice and a public hearing, make such order relative to the rates, prices, charges and practices covered by such contract as the public interest requires.</blockquote>\n<p id=\"b840-3\"><page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"764\">*764</page-number>Mass.Gen.Laws Ann. ch. 164, \u00a7 94 (1976) (emphasis added). The portions of the statute italicized above provide that rate increases may take effect <em>without departmental approval </em>on the first day of the month next after the expiration of fourteen days from the filing of the new rate schedule, but the department may \u201cotherwise authorize,\u201d i.e., advance the effective date or suspend it for a period up to ten months. That the statute is authorizing <em>unilateral </em>rate increases is obvious because it provides: \u201cThe department may investigate the propriety of any such contract, <em>both before and after such contract has become effective ...\u201d </em>(emphasis added). That the Department is authorized to investigate the rate in any contract <em>\u201cafter </em>such contract has become effective\u201d (emphasis added) clearly indicates that the Act authorizes increased rates to become effective prior to any investigation, hearing, or order of the Department, <em>i.e., unilaterally.</em></p>\n<p id=\"b840-4\">Authority for the Massachusetts Department to require a utility to proceed in a manner tantamount to \u00a7 206 stems from its authority under the statute, if it acts promptly, \u201cupon its own motion [to] investigate the propriety of any proposed rate ... and ... pending such investigation and decision thereon [but without any required hearing, to] suspend the taking effect thereof ... [for up to] ten months ... and may, after notice and a public hearing, make such order relative to the rates ... as the public interest requires.\u201d Proceedings authorized by \u00a7 94 of Chapter 164 are therefore analogous in many respects to proceedings authorized under \u00a7 205 and \u00a7 206 of the Federal Power Act. However, the principal procedure for obtaining a rate increase under \u00a7 94 is practically a carbon copy of that under \u00a7 205 except for the longer suspension period \u2014 ten months under the Massachusetts statute as compared to five months under \u00a7 205.</p>\n<p id=\"b840-5\">II. The Decision of the Federal Commission</p>\n<p id=\"b840-6\">With the statutory scheme and the relevant portions of the contract set forth above, the decision of the Commission can be assessed. At the outset, the Commission rejected the contention of New England Power that the contract provided for a fixed rate formula and that its rate provisions could be changed only through bilateral modification, FERC Supplemental Order of Nov. 13, 1984 at 4 (J.A. 219), and held that Holyoke could request rate increases from the Commission under the contract provision in \u00a7 6.06(a) \u201cwhich subjects the contract rate to review <em>and determination </em>by the regulatory body having jurisdiction.\u201d <em>Id. </em>This important ruling is based on the plain wording of the contract and is not challenged on appeal. It authorizes a procedure that was clearly agreed to by the parties when they incorporated Chapter 164 into the power contract to satisfy the requirement of \u00a7 94A. The Commission and the majority seem to overlook the fact that \u00a7 94A of the Massachusetts statute requires the incorporation of \u00a7 94 into the contract for the \u201creview and determination\u201d of the price to be paid for electricity. In addition, the Commission ruled that the state-law procedures referred to in the contract would <em>not </em>authorize Holyoke to file rate changes in a unilateral fashion similar to that of \u00a7 205 of the Federal Power Act.</p>\n<p id=\"b840-8\">A. <em>The Substance of the Commission\u2019s Decision</em></p>\n<p id=\"b840-9\">The position of the Commission upon this point, which was controlling in its disposition of this case, is set forth in the following four sentences of its Supplemental Order on rehearing:</p>\n<blockquote id=\"b840-10\">Since chapter 164 [of Massachusetts General Laws] applies to either procedure [section 93 or section 94 of that chapter] it is not helpful in determining which procedure \u201cmay be applicable to this agreement.\u201d [2] Further, no provision in the contract specifically provides for general unilateral rate filings. [3] However, the contract clearly envisions prospective regulatory determination of the appropriate rate. [4] Thus, we conclude that the contract contemplates an increase in rates prospective only; that <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"765\">*765</page-number>is, amended contract rates may become effective [only] from the date of a Commission order entered at the conclusion of a section 206 proceeding.</blockquote>\n<p id=\"b841-5\"><em>Id. </em>at 5 (J.A. 220) (sentences numbered and discussed below).</p>\n<p id=\"b841-6\">From the quoted portion of the Commission\u2019s Supplemental Order it appears that FERC presumed that the power contract must <em>specifically </em>provide that the utility may unilaterally file rate changes in order to permit the utility to file under \u00a7 205. While the Commission may apply this more rigorous standard to more recent power contracts, we have specifically declined to apply the presumption retroactively. See, for example, <em>Cities of Bethany v. FERC, </em>727 F.2d 1131, 1144 (D.C.Cir.1984), where we said with respect to a 1965 power contract:</p>\n<blockquote id=\"b841-7\">FERC\u2019s tendency in recent years to require an explicit expression in private contracts of the parties\u2019 intention to permit unilateral filings under \u00a7 205 is not highly relevant to the meaning of a provision executed in 1965.</blockquote>\n<p id=\"b841-8\">Nothing would be gained by applying the presumption to the contract here, which was executed in 1957. Following is a review of the bases the Commission gave for its decision.</p>\n<p id=\"b841-9\">B. <em>The First Sentence</em></p>\n<p id=\"b841-10\">In its first sentence above [1] the Commission erroneously construes the Massachusetts statute by interpreting \u00a7 94A of Chapter 164 as being satisfied if the contract authorizes \u201cprice ... review and determination under either procedure\u201d \u2014 \u00a7 93 or \u00a7 94 \u2014 when what should be recognized is that it authorizes proceedings under <em>both </em>\u00a7 93 and \u00a7 94, though \u00a7 93 is in no way relevant to a rate <em>increase </em>being sought by a utility. <em>See supra </em>at 758-759. The Commission\u2019s construction of the contract and Chapter 164 is devoid of logical or factual support and completely fails to recognize the provisions of the contract and the scheme of regulation set forth in the Massachusetts statute which is incorporated into the contract by \u00a7 6.06(a).</p>\n<p id=\"b841-11\">First of all, the terms of the contract <em>are </em>specific. To partially repeat, the parties agreed as follows in \u00a7 6.06(a):</p>\n<blockquote id=\"b841-12\">The prices to be paid for electricity ... <em>shall </em>be subject to review and <em>determination </em>by the Massachusetts Department ... in <em>any proceeding </em>brought under Chapter 164 ... to the extent provided for and <em>in accordance with the provisions of said chapter, insofar as same may be applicable to this agreement.</em></blockquote>\n<p id=\"A4M0\">The Commission admits that this contractual provision incorporated \u00a7 94A into the contract but overlooks the fact that, as a consequence, such section automatically incorporates both \u00a7 93 and \u00a7 94. What could be more specific than the parties agreeing that the price of electricity shall be determined in any proceeding brought under Chapter 164? Since \u201cproceeding[s] ... under Chapter 164\u201d may be brought under both \u00a7 93 <em>and </em>\u00a7 94, the above provision plainly incorporates both \u00a7 93 <em>and </em>\u00a7 94 into the contract. And since the Commission has held that Holyoke may initiate rate changes, \u00a7 94, which authorizes utilities to initiate rate changes, \u201cmay be applicable,\u201d and it is the <em>only </em>section of the statute that may be applicable to any such proceeding initiated by a utility.</p>\n<p id=\"b841-13\">Except for recognizing that \u00a7 94 is included as a necessary part of any request for a rate increase, the principal focus of \u00a7 93 is to permit consumers and public officials (including the Massachusetts Department of Public Utilities) to file complaints regarding the price of electricity, and for the Department to hold a hearing thereon resulting in a possible price <em>reduction. </em>Significantly, \u00a7 93 provides that any subsequent <em>change </em>in the price fixed in accordance with \u00a7 93 \u201cshall not thereafter be changed by said company <em>except as provided in section ninety-four.\u201d </em>This statutory reference to \u00a7 94 constitutes a legislative command that \u00a7 94 complements \u00a7 93. Section 94 is the only statutory provision that directly authorizes utilities to file for <em>rate increases, </em>since \u00a7 93 is generally concerned with rate reductions and is only triggered by public complaints.</p>\n<p id=\"b842-3\"><page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"766\">*766</page-number>Section 94A is equally unequivocal. It provides generally that all contracts must provide that utility prices be subject \u201cto review and determination in any proceeding brought under section ninety-three or ninety-four.\u201d As pointed out above, this authorizes the Department to proceed under either statute. Thus, \u00a7 94A makes utility prices subject to both sections of the statute, and every contract must so provide. Section 6.06(a) of the power contract complies with this statutory requirement that all power contracts authorize proceedings under \u00a7 93 or \u00a7 94 and uses the same words as the <em>statute </em>\u2014 \u201cin <em>any proceeding\u201d </em>\u2014 but instead of providing that \u201cproceedings\u201d would only be subject to \u00a7 93 and \u00a7 94 of Chapter 164 the contract incorporates both of those sections by a broader provision that includes \u201cany proceeding brought under Chapter 164 ... to the extent provided for and in accordance with the provisions of said chapter, insofar as same may be applicable to this agreement.\u201d</p>\n<p id=\"b842-4\">There is no difficulty in interpreting this as including \u00a7 93, \u00a7 94, and \u00a7 94A in the contract, and possibly expanding the incorporation even beyond that to include other provisions in the Massachusetts statute. It is absurd to conclude that the parties intended to exclude \u00a7 94, the <em>exclusive provision for rate increases, </em>when <em>both </em>\u00a7 93 and \u00a7 94A <em>specifically </em>adopt \u00a7 94, and \u00a7 94A requires that \u201cany proceeding\" for a price increase be subject to review and determination under \u00a7 94. The three sections are <em>in pari materia </em>and must be read together. <em>See United States v. American Trucking Ass\u2019ns, Inc., </em>310 U.S. 534, 542-43, 60 S.Ct. 1059, 1063-64, 84 L.Ed. 1345 (1940); <em>FTC v. Manager, Retail Credit Co., </em>515 F.2d 988, 995 (D.C.Cir. 1975).</p>\n<p id=\"b842-5\">To restrict the application of \u00a7 94 to the rare instances where rate increases are sought after a rate reduction, thus eliminating its application to requests for all normal rate increases, would violate the terms of the statute. <em>Nothing in the record supports such construction of the statute. </em>And even if two interpretations were possible \u2014 one that incorporates \u00a7 94 as required by \u00a7 94A, and one that incorporates it only in part for the limited purpose of \u00a7 6.06(b) \u2014 that interpretation should be adopted which complies with the law rather than one that would make the contract illegal by not including \u00a7 94. <em>Great Northern Ry. v. Delmar Co., </em>283 U.S. 686, 691, 51 S.Ct. 579, 581, 75 L.Ed. 1349 (1931); <em>Eddy v. Prudence Bonds Corp., </em>165 F.2d 157, 161 (2d Cir.1947), <em>cert. denied, </em>333 U.S. 845, 68 S.Ct. 664, 92 L.Ed. 1128 (1948); <em>American Machine &amp; Metals, Inc. v. De-Bothezat Impeller Co., </em>180 F.2d 342, 347 (2d Cir.) (because of doubts as to a contract\u2019s legality \u201cthe court will presume that the parties did not intend to make an illegal contract\u201d), <em>cert. denied, </em>339 U.S. 979, 70 S.Ct. 1025, 94 L.Ed. 1383 (1950); Restatement (Second) of Contracts \u00a7 203 (courts prefer an interpretation which gives a reasonable and lawful meaning to all terms in a contract to an interpretation which leaves a part unreasonable or unlawful).</p>\n<p id=\"b842-7\">C. <em>The Second Sentence</em></p>\n<p id=\"b842-8\">The second sentence of the Commission\u2019s opinion [2] is similarly mistaken in asserting: \u201cFurther, no provision in the contract <em>specifically </em>provides for general unilateral rate filings.\u201d (J.A. 220) (emphasis added). However, \u00a7 6.06(a) of the contract specifically provides for general unilateral rate filings when it states that prices for electricity shall \u201cbe subject to <em>review and determination\u201d </em>by the Department in <em>\u201cany </em>proceeding\u201d under Chapter 164. The contract thereby incorporates \u00a7 94, which is a part of Chapter 164, and that section specifically authorizes general unilateral rate filings as pointed out <em>supra </em>at pp. 758-759.</p>\n<p id=\"b842-9\">D. <em>The Third Sentence</em></p>\n<p id=\"b842-10\">In the third sentence [3] the Commission states that \u201cthe contract clearly envisions prospective regulatory determination of the appropriate rate.\u201d This language of the Commission means amended contract rates may become effective only from the date of a Commission order entered at the conclu<page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"767\">*767</page-number>sion of a \u00a7 206 proceeding. <em>See </em>sentence [4]. Section 93 which by its terms is available only to public officials and consumers is clearly a regulatory determination of this order. But recognizing the existence of prospective rate determinations under \u00a7 93 does not justify failing to recognize that the very same statute specifically authorizes and requires <em>other </em>rate changes to follow the \u00a7 94 procedure. And \u00a7 94 is even clearer in recognizing that rate increases may be <em>unilateral </em>when it provides: \u201cThe department may investigate the propriety of any such contract, both before <em>and after </em>such contract has become effective ...\u201d (J.A. 233) (emphasis added). Failing to recognize the applicability of \u00a7 94 is erroneous, to repeat, because the parties agreed in \u00a7 6.06(a) of the contract that \u201cprices ... shall be subject to ... <em>determination </em>... in <em>any proceeding </em>brought under Chapter 164...\u201d That provision incorporates \u00a7 94 and its unilateral method of securing a rate increase. <em>Supra </em>at 763. The fourth and final quoted sentence [4] is simply a reiteration of the erroneous result based on the incorrect premises set forth above.</p>\n<p id=\"b843-5\">III. This Court\u2019s Jurisdiction Under the Petition for Rehearing</p>\n<p id=\"asm-dedup-0\">Prior to addressing the majority\u2019s arguments, the jurisdictional posture of this case must be clarified. The majority responds to the interpretation of the contract in this opinion by asserting in a footnote that the court lacks jurisdiction to pursue such an inquiry, to wit:</p>\n<blockquote id=\"b843-8\">The dissent would grant Holyoke\u2019s petition for review on the ground that the Commission failed to recognize that Ho-lyoke\u2019s own interpretation of the statute was, in point of fact, erroneous---- We do not, however, reach the merits of the dissent\u2019s statutory analysis. This court lacks jurisdiction to reverse the Commission on the basis of an error raised by the court <em>sua sponte </em>if the error was not \u201curged\u201d before the Commission in the rehearing application____ <em>A fortiori, </em>we may not reverse the Commission for relying on petitioner\u2019s own interpretation of Massachusetts law.</blockquote>\n<p id=\"b843-13\">Maj. Op. at n. 5 (emphasis added).<footnotemark>6</footnotemark> <em>But the error was urged in the rehearing application. </em>Holyoke specifically raised the issue <em>in its Request for Rehearing, </em>from which is taken the following quotation:</p>\n<blockquote id=\"b843-14\">The Commission\u2019s disallowance of the right to file unilateral rate increases is in error and is unsupported by both a fair reading of the applicable language of the Power Contracts and an analysis of the rate review mechanisms of Chapter 164 of the General Laws of Massachusetts.</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b843-15\">... [T]he parties inserted a <em>broad </em>rate review mechanism by referring in Section 6.06(a) to <em>\u201cany </em>proceeding\u201d under Chapter 164; thereby incorporating <em>both </em>the Section 93 <em>and </em>the Section 94 rate review mechanisms. As the Commission <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"768\">*768</page-number>acknowledged in the Supplemental Order, Section 93 reflects a rate change procedure similar to Section 206 of the Act and <em>Section 94 is a unilateral rate change mechanism parallel to that found in Section 205 of the Act.</em></blockquote>\n<p id=\"b844-4\">(J.A. 224-25) (emphasis added). The italicized language clearly raised the <em>exact </em>point that Holyoke urges here. Holyoke could not more specifically have indicated its reliance on \u00a7 94 of Chapter 164, and the contract between the parties, to support its claimed right to file a unilateral rate increase as is authorized by \u00a7 94 and \u00a7 205.</p>\n<p id=\"b844-5\">Of course, the relevant statute does require that \u201c[n]o objection to the order of the [Federal Energy Regulatory] Commission shall be considered by the court unless such objection shall have been urged before the Commission in the application for rehearing ...\u201d 16 U.S.C. \u00a7 <em>8251 </em>(b) (1982).

In other words, a party who contests solely the amount of a rate filing before the Commission under \u00a7 205, for example, cannot for the first time on appeal challenge the legality of the filing under <em>Mobile-Sierra. </em>The exhaustion requirement does not prohibit an appellate court from considering more elaborate legal arguments on properly preserved grounds of error, but even this expansion of the general rule need not be relied on here.</p>\n<p id=\"b844-9\">It is plain that Holyoke\u2019s Request for Rehearing (J.A. 222-28) provided adequate notice to alert the Commission to its primary assignment of error \u2014 namely, that the rate filing should have been accepted as a unilateral filing under \u00a7 205 of the Federal Power Act.</p>\n<p id=\"b844-10\">The majority opinion does not dispute that the above asserted error was urged before the Commission. Rather, the majority asserts that \u201cHolyoke expressly conceded before the Commission and this court that the requirement for regulatory oversight in section 94A of Chapter 164 may be satisfied by subjecting the contract price to review and determination under <em>either </em>section 94 or section 93.\u201d Maj. Op. at 758 (emphasis in original). It hardly amounts to much of a concession for Holyoke to reiterate the express terms of \u00a7 94A, <em>see supra, </em>but this otherwise irrelevant point is accorded significance only because of the majority's implicit, and surely wrong-headed, assumption that a utility can file for rate increases under either \u00a7 93 or \u00a7 94 of Chapter 164. That the majority makes this erroneous assumption is obvious considering the majority\u2019s subsequent statement distinguishing this case from that of <em>Richmond Power &amp; Light v. FPC, </em>481 F.2d 490, 500 (D.C.Cir.), <em>cert. denied, </em>414 U.S. 1068, 94 S.Ct. 578, 38 L.Ed.2d 473 (1973), a reference that implies that the present power contract would permit a <em>utility </em>to file for a <em>rate increase </em>under both \u00a7 93 and \u00a7 94. In fact, Holyoke <em>never </em>so conceded before either the Commission or this court. Holyoke asserted that \u201creview of rate changes\u201d could be accomplished \u201cunder Section 93 or 94\u201d but never admitted that a utility could <em>initiate </em>a rate increase under \u00a7 93, for the obvious reason that \u00a7 93 does not authorize <em>utilities </em>to invoke the complaint procedure or to initiate rate increases. Holyoke so alleged in its Answer to the Pleading of August 23, 1984 of New England Power Company, to wit:</p>\n<blockquote id=\"b845-4\"><page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"769\">*769</page-number>Within Chapter 164, Sections 93 and 94 provide the procedural framework for accomplishing rate revisions in Massachusetts, as well as the substantive standards for acting upon applications for rate revisions. <em>Section 93 provides for a DPU [Department of Public Utilities] proceeding initiated upon complaint by certain buyers, and other [public] persons </em>and is a mechanism equivalent to Section 206 of the Federal Power Act.</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b845-5\">Most importantly, <em>Section 94 provides for unilateral filings by public utilities selling energy, </em>subject to the review of the DPU____ In essence, Section 94 is (and was in 1957 when the relevant contract was agreed to) a rate change mechanism almost identical to Section 205 of the Federal Power Act.</blockquote>\n<p id=\"b845-8\">(J.A. 198-99) (footnote omitted) (emphasis added). In its brief to this court Holyoke makes the same point:</p>\n<blockquote id=\"b845-9\"><em>Section 93 provides for a DPU proceeding initiated upon complaint by buyers and other persons </em>and provides for prospective regulatory determination of reductions or changes in existing rates. <em>Section 94, on the other hand, provides for unilateral rate filings by public utilities </em>subject to DPU review.</blockquote>\n<p id=\"b845-10\">Holyoke Brief at 24 (emphasis added). To repeat, \u00a7 93 is not available to Holyoke or any utility seeking a rate increase and its relevance to this case, if any, is minimal at best; \u00a7 94 is the only authority for a utility to <em>initiate </em>a rate increase.</p>\n<p id=\"b845-11\">The error assigned by petitioner, as indicated above, was that the rate filing should have been accepted under \u00a7 205 of the Federal Power Act as the parties had agreed to a similar procedure by incorporating \u00a7 94 into the contract as part of Chapter 164. In order to resolve this question the Commission was required by <em>Mobile-Sierra </em>to consult the power contract. The power contract in turn required the Commission to determine what type of filing was permitted under Chapter 164 of Massachusetts General Laws because such laws were incorporated into the contract, and \u00a7 93 and \u00a7 94 are part of that chapter. The argument proffered by this dissent flows not from a new or obscure source, but from the plain reading of the Massachusetts law that was <em>necessarily considered by the Commission. </em>Moreover, no court should accept the majority\u2019s implicit conclusion that a party may \u201cconcede\u201d an erroneous construction of a pure matter of law, thereby creating a precedent that saddles the agency, the reviewing court, and perhaps even future litigants with an incorrect interpretation of the statute.</p>\n<p id=\"b845-13\">IV. The Majority Opinion</p>\n<p id=\"b845-14\">Untroubled by analysis, the majority affirms the Commission in an opinion that compensates in brevity for what it lacks in substance. The majority addresses what it characterizes as Holyoke\u2019s chief assignment of error, namely that Chapter 164 \u201cunequivocally evinces the intent of the parties to subject the contractual rate formula to [the unilateral rate filing method of] section 94.\u201d Maj. Op. at 757. The majority rejects the clarity proffered by Holyoke for two reasons. First, the majority construes the <em>mutatis mutandis </em>clause of \u00a7 6.06(a) (\u201cinsofar as the same may he applicable to this agreement\u201d) as evidence of equivocation. Second, the majority contends that \u201cHolyoke expressly conceded before the Commission and this court that the requirement for regulatory oversight in section 94A of Chapter 164 may be satisfied by subjecting the contract price to review and determination under <em>either </em>section 94 or section 93.\u201d Maj. Op. at 758. Having thus persuaded itself by its mistaken construction that the power contract does not \u201cunequivocally\u201d incorporate \u00a7 94, the majority undiscriminatingly asserts that the specific allowance of a unilateral rate filing under certain circumstances, provided in \u00a7 6.06(b) of the contract, falls within the interpretive doctrine of <em>expressio unius est exclusio alterius, i.e., </em>that which was not included in the contract is excluded. Maj. Op. at 758-59.</p>\n<p id=\"b845-15\">In my opinion none of these contentions withstand even the most cursory analysis. Consider the paucity of support for the <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"770\">*770</page-number>majority\u2019s contention that the contract does not include the unilateral rate filing mechanism of \u00a7 94. The majority inexplicably relies on the <em>mutatis mutandis </em>clause (\u201cinsofar as the same may be applicable\u201d) in order to contravene the specific terms of the agreement. This argument is reminiscent of the man arrested for walking on the courthouse lawn where the sign said, \u201cKeep Off the Grass.\u201d In defense he argued, \u201cBut the sign doesn\u2019t say positively.\u201d The majority surely cannot intend that this standard contractual phrase (\u201cinsofar as the same may be applicable\u201d) will hereafter be included in power contracts at the expense of the specific terms of the contract, yet this is the import of their opinion.</p>\n<p id=\"b846-4\">Makeweight arguments like the majority\u2019s attack on the <em>mutatis mutandis </em>clause might be unobjectionable if joined with arguments of greater substance, but that unfortunately does not characterize the majority opinion. Immediately following the <em>mutatis mutandis </em>assertion the majority opinion relies on Holyoke\u2019s reiteration of the terms of \u00a7 94A in order to undermine Holyoke\u2019s argument that the contract incorporated \u00a7 94. If the \u201cconcession\u201d that the procedures required by \u00a7 94A govern the instant power contract is grounds for the Commission\u2019s exclusion of \u00a7 94, one might extend the majority\u2019s logic to ask whether the inclusion of \u00a7 94A in Chapter 164 itself provides cause to doubt that \u00a7 94 indeed is a viable part of that chapter. The answer is obvious.</p>\n<p id=\"b846-5\">Following this unsupported \u201cconcession,\u201d the majority attempts to wring out a relevant \u201cadmission\u201d with respect to \u00a7 93 by contending:</p>\n<blockquote id=\"b846-6\">Holyoke\u2019s <em>admission </em>that Massachusetts law permitted \u201cthe parties [to] include Section 93 as the only rate review mechanism in their contract,\u201d Brief for Petitioner at 27, is quite significant because Section 93 provides for rate changes effective only upon regulatory approval.</blockquote>\n<p id=\"AOY2\">Maj. Op. at 758 (emphasis added). Actually there is nothing \u201csignificant\u201d about Ho-lyoke\u2019s statement because, as the majority fails to state and as is stated elsewhere in the contract, \u00a7 93 is <em>not </em>the <em>only </em>rate review mechanism in the contract. The issue raised by the Commission is <em>not </em>the plain meaning of \u00a7 93 but the extent to which the incorporation of Chapter 164 into the contract included \u00a7\u00a7 93, 94, and 94A. Holyoke\u2019s brief at pages 27-28 does <em>not </em>make any \u201cadmission\u201d that supports the above quoted assertion in the majority opinion. The full statement in Holyoke\u2019s brief at pages 27-28 follows:</p>\n<blockquote id=\"b846-8\">Had the parties included Section 93 as the only rate review mechanism in their contract, the Holyoke Companies\u2019 right to seek immediate effectiveness for changes to the Power Contracts would have been limited. To the contrary, the parties did not so limit the Holyoke Companies\u2019 rights to secure contract changes. By including the language of Section 6.06(a) in the Power Contracts, and thereby providing for the entire range of regulatory review available pursuant to Chapter 164, the parties agreed to permit unilateral filings by the Holyoke Companies under Section 94 procedures, as well as complaint proceedings initiated under Section 93. When the jurisdiction of the Commission over the contract subsequently was established, the Power Contracts therefore expressly recognized that filings could be made under Section 205 of the Act, as well as complaints under Section 206.</blockquote>\n<p id=\"b846-9\">Holyoke Brief at 27-28 (footnote omitted).</p>\n<p id=\"b846-10\">It seems clear therefore that the majority has disregarded the scheme for securing rate increases that is specifically provided for in the Massachusetts statute. Starting with the uncontested holding of the Commission that the power contract permits utilities to <em>initiate </em>rate changes, the relevant procedure under Massachusetts Chapter 164 is clear. Section 94A provides that rates shall be determined \u201cin <em>any proceeding </em>brought under section ninety-three <em>or </em>ninety-four\u201d (emphasis added). Although \u00a7 94A permits rate changes under either \u00a7 93 or \u00a7 94, it is quite clear that <em>no utility can initiate a rate change under \u00a7 93. </em>Section 93 procedures can be used only by <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"771\">*771</page-number>\u201cthe [state] attorney general, or the mayor of a city, or the selectmen of a town, or of twenty customers thereof ...\u201d or the Department. Therefore, since Holyoke admittedly has the right to initiate rate increases, as the Commission held, and \u00a7 <em>93 is not </em>available to utilities for such purposes, the <em>only </em>applicable statutory procedure available when Holyoke proposes a rate increase in the unilateral filing method provided by \u00a7 94. This case, then, is precisely the type of case in which state law permits a <em>utility </em>seeking a rate increase to make only one type of initial filing, <em>i.e., </em>that under \u00a7 94. <em>See Richmond Power &amp; Light v. FPC, </em>481 F.2d 490, 500 (D.C.Cir.), <em>cert. denied, </em>414 U.S. 1068, 94 S.Ct. 578, 38 L.Ed.2d 473 (1973).</p>\n<p id=\"b847-5\">The rough analogy between \u00a7 93 and \u00a7 94 of Chapter 164 and the Federal Power Act thus collapses because \u00a7 94 does not authorize <em>initial </em>filings for rate increases by utilities. Under the Federal Power Act a utility can file a rate change under either \u00a7 205 or \u00a7 206, the major practical difference being the time at which the rate increase takes effect. By contrast, \u00a7 93 of Chapter 164 is limited to providing the means by which consumers and public representatives can petition for rate <em>reductions </em>and changes. <em>See </em>Note, <em>State Administrative Practice: An Illustrative Survey of the Procedure of the Massachusetts Department of Public Utilities, </em>67 Harv.L.Rev. 845, 848-52 (1954). The only procedure under Massachusetts law by which a utility may <em>initiate </em>rate increases is the method provided by \u00a7 94 which in its initial stages is essentially unilateral. That the contract does not refer <em>specifically </em>(not \u201cunequivocally\u201d to use the majority\u2019s characterization) to \u00a7 94, is no more relevant than that it does not refer specifically to \u00a7 93 or \u00a7 94A, because initial rate filings by a utility under Massachusetts law can <em>only </em>be effected through the procedures of \u00a7 94. And \u00a7 94, along with \u00a7 93 and \u00a7 94A, are effectively incorporated by the contractual inclusion of Chapter 164 \u201cinsofar as the same <em>may </em>be applicable to this agreement\u201d (emphasis added). There is no doubt that <em>both </em>\u00a7 93 and \u00a7 94 \u201cmay be applicable to [the] agreement.\u201d And it is important to note that the power contract limited any deviation from the Massachusetts statute by providing that <em>all rate determinations </em>under Chapter 164 must be <em>\u201cin accordance with the provisions of said chapter,\u201d </em>\u00a7 6.06(a) (J.A. 86) (emphasis added), and \u00a7 94A of the chapter requires that price determination proceedings be subject \u201cto review and determination\u201d under either \u00a7 93 or \u00a7 94 as same may be applicable. Thus, the power contract cannot reasonably be construed to limit compliance with \u00a7 94 solely to proceedings involving rate increases following ordered rate reductions.</p>\n<p id=\"b847-7\">The third point relied on by the majority \u2014 the unilateral rate filing permitted by \u00a7 6.06(b) of the contract \u2014 cannot alone bear the weight of the disposition in this case. This clause is intended for, and is limited to, the rare situation where a rate increase is requested right after a mandatory rate reduction has been ordered, and is perfectly consonant with \u00a7 93 of Chapter 164. Indeed, the status of the complaint procedures specified in \u00a7 93 are <em>inseparable </em>from the rate filing procedures specified in \u00a7 94, since the language of \u00a7 93 specifically provides, in the event of a rate reduction by order of the Massachusetts Department of Public Utilities, that \u201c[t]he price or prices fixed by any such order shall not thereafter be changed by said company <em>except as provided in section ninety-four.\u201d </em>This recognizes that \u00a7 94 is the <em>only </em>provision available to a utility to file for a rate increase. The scheme of the Act thus puts each section in its proper place \u2014 \u00a7 93 for rate complaints and \u00a7 94 for utilities <em>initiating </em>rate increases. There is thus no sound basis for the Commission and the majority to assert that the parties intended that \u00a7 6.06(b) of the contract should preclude Holyoke from filing for a unilateral rate increase under \u00a7 94.</p>\n<p id=\"b847-8\">It is obvious that the intent of the parties in \u00a7 6.06(b) was to allow Holyoke to file for a rate increase following a mandatory rate reduction, <em>but to limit Holyoke to an increase in an \u201camount no greater than </em><page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"772\">*772</page-number><em>[befare the] reduction. </em>\u201d In this provision the contract recognizes that without this contractual restriction Holyoke could permissibly file for a greater rate increase under \u00a7 94. Contractually limiting a subsequent application for a rate increase after a rate reduction to an amount not to exceed the prior rate is a perfectly reasonable provision that provides mutual protection to the parties. Holyoke is afforded an opportunity to recoup its loss and the customer is guaranteed that the prior rate will not be exceeded. There is no reasonable basis, however, and no support in the record, for construing \u00a7 6.06(b) so as to distort the entire contract and prevent Ho-lyoke in other circumstances from using the exclusive statutory method for obtaining a rate increase, <em>when the Commission has held, as here, that Holyoke may file for rate increases. </em>As stated above, there is no support in the record, or in law, for the crabbed construction that the Commission and the majority give to \u00a7 6.06(b) of the contract, which does gross violence to the plain intent of the parties and the requirements of the Massachusetts statute.</p>\n<p id=\"b848-4\">V. Conclusion</p>\n<p id=\"b848-5\">As the Commission held, the contract authorizes Holyoke to initiate rate increases pursuant to Massachusetts law. The only procedure for initiating rate changes available to a utility under Massachusetts law is the method prescribed by \u00a7 94, under which a utility may unilaterally initiate a rate change to take effect immediately, or after a ten-month period if suspension is ordered. This unilateral procedure is prescribed by the plain language of the Massachusetts statute which is incorporated into the contract, and our analysis under <em>Mobile-Sierra </em>must be in accord.</p>\n<p id=\"b848-7\">It is my opinion, therefore, that the court should reverse the decision of the Commission holding that the rate filing by Holyoke under \u00a7 205 of the Federal Power Act was illegal and remand the case to the Commission for further consideration not inconsistent with this opinion. Because the Commission\u2019s decision is based on an erroneous interpretation of law and of the contract, our deference is neither required nor advisable. I respectfully dissent.</p>\n<footnote label=\"1\">\n<p id=\"b835-14\">. The contract was entered into between the parties in 1957 when doubt existed whether state law or federal law would apply. It is now settled that federal statutes apply, but Massachusetts law is relevant because, by the incorporation of Chapter 164 in its entirety into the contract, it expresses the intent of the parties as to whether rate increases may be obtained unilaterally or whether a hearing and approval of the application must first occur.</p>\n</footnote>\n<footnote label=\"2\">\n<p id=\"b835-15\">.
