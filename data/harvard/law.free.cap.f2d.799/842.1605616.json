Platt, Jr., Judge, in connection with the importation into the United States from Colombia of 4,920 pounds of marijuana in March of 1984 and the distribution of cocaine. Count One of the indictment charged Serna and Cinnante with conspiring to import, possess, and distribute marijuana and to possess and distribute cocaine in violation of 21 U.S.C. \u00a7 846 (1982); Count Two charged Serna with directing the importation of the marijuana in <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"844\">*844</page-number>violation of 21 U.S.C. \u00a7\u00a7 952(a), 960(a)(1) (1982) and 18 U.S.C. \u00a7 2 (1982); Count Three charged both Serna and Cinnante with the crime of possession of marijuana with the intent to distribute it in violation of 21 U.S.C. \u00a7 841(a)(1) (1982) and 18 U.S.C. \u00a7 2. Each defendant was found guilty on all counts charged. Judge Platt sentenced Serna to concurrent twelve-year terms of imprisonment on Counts One and Two and a concurrent five-year term on Count Three, to be followed by concurrent lifetime special parole terms, as well as a cumulative fine of $65,000; Cinnante was sentenced to a twelve-year prison term on Count One and a concurrent ten-year prison term on Count Three, to be followed by a concurrent lifetime special parole term, and a cumulative fine of $80,000. Appellants challenge four evidentiary rulings of the trial court. Cinnante also claims that the evidence was insufficient to support his conviction and that the trial court should have granted his motion for a new trial on the basis of newly discovered evidence. We affirm.</p>\n<p id=\"b920-4\">BACKGROUND</p>\n<p id=\"b920-5\">On March 13, 1984, United States Customs inspectors at the Brooklyn seaport discovered sixty-eight bales of marijuana weighing about two and one-half tons secreted inside a false compartment of a shipping container loaded with furniture that arrived aboard a vessel from Colombia. According to the ship\u2019s manifest, the furniture was destined for a Marco Castell\u00f3n at a Corona, Queens, address. Customs and Drug Enforcement Administration (\u201cDEA\u201d) officials removed the marijuana from the container, except for a small quantity deliberately left inside the false compartment. The furniture was placed back into the container, which was left on the Brooklyn waterfront to be claimed in the normal course by a customs broker. On March 29, Atlantic &amp; Pacific Transport, Inc. (\u201cA &amp; P\u201d), a brokerage firm, effected customs clearance for the container and transported it by truck to its lot in Queens. A &amp; P personnel advised DEA agents that someone would arrive on April 2, 1984, to transport the container.</p>\n<p id=\"b920-7\">On the morning of April 2, Kenneth Neal Chupurdy drove a tractor to the A &amp; P lot; shortly thereafter, Marco Castell\u00f3n arrived at the A &amp; P offices. After Castell\u00f3n completed payment, Chupurdy hooked up the container to his tractor and, followed by surveillance agents, drove to a truck stop in South Kearney, New Jersey. Cas-tell\u00f3n took a taxi from A &amp; P to LaGuardia Airport and was arrested as he was about to board a flight to Florida. Agents stopped Chupurdy after he was observed driving away from the truck stop in his tractor without the container and then arrested him as a result of information Cas-tell\u00f3n provided to the DEA following his arrest. Thereafter DEA agents, pursuant to a search warrant, obtained a black bag belonging to Chupurdy from a New Jersey motel where he had been registered at the time of his arrest. Inside the bag was a telephone address book with various names and numbers, including the name \u201cCian-nante [sic]\u201d without any first name, telephone number, or address.</p>\n<p id=\"b920-8\">Castell\u00f3n agreed to cooperate immediately following his arrest. He did so and eventually testified at trial. Castell\u00f3n advised the DEA agents that the marijuana importation scheme had been conceived and directed by Jorge Serna and by a man named \u201cSteven,\u201d whose last name Castel-l\u00f3n did not know. Castell\u00f3n described Steven as about thirty-five to forty years old, between five feet ten inches and six feet two inches tall, about 200 pounds, with dirtyish blond hair, a moustache, blue eyes, and \u201cvery nice teeth.\u201d He stated that Ser-na had recruited him to act as consignee for the container for $50,000, and provided details of the importation scheme.</p>\n<p id=\"b920-9\">During the previous few months Castel-l\u00f3n had purchased some five kilograms of cocaine from Serna on a consignment basis for resale, for which he owed Serna about $20,000. On several occasions in late 1983 and early 1984, Castell\u00f3n, when delivering sums of money to Serna for cocaine, observed Serna making notations in a black <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"845\">*845</page-number>notebook or ledger comprised of entries for various customers. Customers were designated by a code name or first name, and a detailed balance sheet for each customer recorded deliveries of kilograms of cocaine, payments made and balances due; a separate section listed accounts in Miami and Bahamian banks.</p>\n<p id=\"b921-5\">With respect to the marijuana container, Serna gave Castell\u00f3n the bills of lading and other necessary documents and instructed him to travel to New York and hire a customs broker to handle the customs clearance. Castell\u00f3n made three trips to New York in March 1984, retained the A &amp; P brokerage firm, and paid for its services with money that Serna provided. A &amp; P reported delays and during one of the trips Castell\u00f3n telephoned Serna, who advised him that an \u201cAmerican gentleman by the name Steven\u201d would call him at his hotel to ask about the delays. A few minutes later, Castell\u00f3n received a telephone call from a man who identified himself as Steven and asked Castell\u00f3n questions about the lack of progress in clearing the container.</p>\n<p id=\"b921-6\">On March 29, 1984, Serna and Castell\u00f3n met in a Miami restaurant to discuss the delays. Serna remarked to Castell\u00f3n that his \u201cAmerican friends will not believe him any more.\u201d He also confided that \u201cthis gentleman Steven ... has the customer for this marijuana\u201d and remarked that they would now refer to Steven as \u201cJohn.\u201d Later the same day, A &amp; P cleared the container and told Castell\u00f3n he had to collect it from the lot as soon as possible. After learning of this news, Serna told Castell\u00f3n to go to a House of Pancakes restaurant in Miami the following morning to meet Steven and Steven\u2019s truckdriver. At the restaurant Serna introduced Cinnante to Castell\u00f3n only as \u201cSteven\u201d; Chupurdy was identified simply as the truckdriver. Cinnante sat down next to Serna and across from Castellon and Chupurdy, about two to three feet from Castell\u00f3n. Because of language difficulties Castell\u00f3n, who spoke both English and Spanish, acted as interpreter. Castell\u00f3n reported to \u201cSteven\u201d that A &amp; P wanted the container moved from its lot \u201cas soon as possible\u201d because of a recent snowstorm. Discussing transportation, Cinnante told Serna that, before delivering the marijuana to the customer in Philadelphia, he planned to leave the container overnight in a rest area in New Jersey to \u201csee if the feds are watching.\u201d He explained that on a prior occasion the container was found to be \u201cfull of bugs,\u201d i.e., electronic devices. Serna told Cinnante that it was \u201cgood\u201d to have snow covering the container because \u201cthat way the marijuana will not smell.\u201d Castell\u00f3n, hesitant to use the word \u201cmarijuana\u201d in a public place, incongruously used the word \u201cpot\u201d to convey this message in English. Cin-nante remarked to Serna that \u201cyou will not believe how fast you\u2019re going to get your money.\u201d Serna replied that \u201cmoney is the last thing [I\u2019m] worried about.\u201d He stressed that he wanted Steven to be in Philadelphia when the deal was consummated to avoid dispute about the quantity and quality of the merchandise.</p>\n<p id=\"b921-8\">At this stage in the House of Pancakes conversation, Serna and Cinnante began to speak about other transactions. Serna asked, \u201c[H]ow about a little money[?]\u201d and Cinnante replied that he could probably get $50,000 or $75,000. Serna and Cinnante also discussed Serna\u2019s recent purchase of a DC-3 airplane, which was ready for a \u201ctest flight down there.\u201d Serna told Cinnante that he \u201cmust not forget that next week they have [another] container coming into San Francisco.\u201d The entire conversation lasted about thirty to thirty-five minutes.</p>\n<p id=\"b921-9\">After the meeting, Castell\u00f3n asked Serna whether he was sure that \u201cSteven\u201d and the truckdriver were not \u201cpolicemen.\u201d Serna assured Castell\u00f3n that \u201cSteven,\u201d who resided in the Boca Raton area, was a longstanding business associate in cocaine trafficking who owed Serna $800,000 for cocaine already delivered and was asking for more cocaine.</p>\n<p id=\"b921-10\">Castell\u00f3n also cooperated after his arrest by telephoning Serna while DEA agents tape-recorded the conversation. In all, seven such telephone conversations in Spanish were recorded. Using a cover story provid<page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"846\">*846</page-number>ed by the DEA agents, Castell\u00f3n told Serna that he was still in New York because he had missed his flight as a result of a weapons check by airport police. Castell\u00f3n asked Serna whether he had spoken to \u201cSteven.\u201d Serna responded, \u201cNo, I\u2019m waiting for him to call me,\u201d and suggested that the airport stop \u201ccould be a coincidence.\u201d The following day Serna informed Castel-l\u00f3n that he learned from \u201cJohn\u201d that the \u201cchauffeur was in jail\u201d and added that it was \u201cstrange\u201d for Castell\u00f3n not to have been arrested. Serna also instructed Cas-tell\u00f3n that if he was caught he should claim lack of knowledge about the marijuana and assert that a fictitious Pedro Gonzalez had hired him to act as consignee. Serna promised to provide a lawyer for Castellon\u2019s defense, admonished him to be loyal and discreet, and warned him that \u201ceverything is going to get complicated\u201d if he revealed that Serna was the marijuana\u2019s owner.</p>\n<p id=\"b922-4\">Later that day, Serna informed Castell\u00f3n that \u201cJohn\u201d was accusing Castell\u00f3n of cooperating with the authorities, whereas Serna had told \u201cJohn\u201d that he was \u201cleery of ... his chauffeur,\u201d who Serna suspected was involved in a scheme to \u201crip off\u201d John. Serna added that he believed that the \u201cchauffeur\u201d had cooperated with the authorities because \u201cthat stuff [was] welded together very well.\u201d In relating his conversations with \u201cJohn,\u201d Serna several times referred to John as Steven, at one point immediately correcting himself.</p>\n<p id=\"b922-5\">On April 4, 1984, DEA agents, armed with an arrest warrant for Serna, accompanied Castell\u00f3n to Miami. Castell\u00f3n telephoned Serna\u2019s beeper and in two recorded conversations advised Serna that he had returned to Miami and wished to meet with him to obtain more money. Serna demanded to know about Castellon\u2019s \u201cbalance with me for twenty,\u201d an apparent reference to the $20,000 Castell\u00f3n owed for cocaine delivered. Although Serna told Castell\u00f3n to call back to set up a meeting, Castellon\u2019s subsequent calls to Serna\u2019s beeper went unanswered.</p>\n<p id=\"b922-6\">On April 6, Nubia Serna, Serna\u2019s wife, left their residence in Key Biscayne and drove to the parking lot of a Burger King restaurant in Miami where she gave two men an attache case and a shopping bag. DEA agents who had her under surveillance stopped the men, who handed over the attache case, a black notebook, and the shopping bag, which contained men\u2019s clothing. Looking in the black notebook, one of the agents recognized it as a narcotics ledger reflecting large-scale cocaine transactions. Upon opening the attache case, the agents discovered numerous items of identification with Serna\u2019s name and photograph, a card containing the beeper number that Castell\u00f3n had dialed to contact Serna for the agents, and a handwritten list containing names and telephone numbers identical to some of those found in the black ledger. The two men told the agents that all of these items \u201cbelonged to Mr. Serna.\u201d An analysis of the ledger revealed that it recorded deliveries of more than 200 kilograms of cocaine between April 1983 and March 1984 to twenty-one major customers for which the customers had already paid approximately $5 million, with several million dollars still outstanding. Serna was finally located and arrested on June 26, 1984. In his possession were several identification documents, all in a false name.</p>\n<p id=\"b922-8\">DEA Group Supervisor Raymond Tripic-chio decided that the defendant Steven John Cinnante, who resided in the Boca Raton area, was likely the \u201cSteven\u201d Castel-l\u00f3n had met. The agent obtained a copy of Cinnante\u2019s 1980 driver\u2019s license bearing his photograph, which showed Cinnante to have dark hair and no moustache. He reproduced that photo and showed it in a photograph array of seven other clean-shaven men to Castell\u00f3n. Castell\u00f3n said that Cinnante\u2019s photograph \u201clook[s] very much like ... Steven,\u201d but declined to make a positive identification because the man pictured had no moustache, had darker hair, and appeared to be younger than \u201cSteven.\u201d At Castellon\u2019s suggestion, he drew a mous-tache on a copy of Cinnante\u2019s photo, stating that it \u201clooks like ... this Steven that I have met in the House of Pancakes,\u201d but he could not be \u201ctotally sure\u201d without see<page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"847\">*847</page-number>ing a \u201cbetter picture.\u201d Thereafter, Tripic-chio obtained a copy of Cinnante\u2019s May 1984 driver\u2019s license, which had a photo of him with light brown hair and a full mous-tache. The agent then prepared a photographic array comprised of ten photos, including Cinnante\u2019s, of moustached men with some similar facial features. He also prepared a photo array that did not include Cinnante; it consisted of ten men without moustaches, one of whom was a subject of a DEA investigation and named Steven. Castell\u00f3n recognized none of the photographs in the latter array. After looking for about ten minutes at the former photo array, he asked for the photo array from July, compared the two, and identified Cin-nante\u2019s recent and earlier photos as \u201cSteven.\u201d Cinnante was arrested on September 25, 1984.</p>\n<p id=\"b923-5\">On June 17, 1985, the date of jury selection, Castell\u00f3n went to the courthouse cafeteria and joined the long line of people waiting to buy lunch. As the man ahead of him turned, Castell\u00f3n was \u201cshocked\u201d to see that he was \u201cSteven.\u201d Castell\u00f3n had believed \u201cSteven\u201d was in jail. Castell\u00f3n testified that \u201che looked at me very angry,\u201d and Castell\u00f3n looked away from the \u201ctwin representation of Steven.\u201d That individual, however, repeatedly turned around, looked angrily at him and then spoke with intermittent nervous laughter to the woman who accompanied him. The man in line ahead of Castell\u00f3n was Cinnante.</p>\n<p id=\"b923-6\">Neither defendant testified, the principal defense focusing on Castellon\u2019s credibility, and especially on his admitted cocaine involvement and his cooperation agreement.</p>\n<p id=\"b923-7\">DISCUSSION</p>\n<p id=\"b923-8\">Although Cinnante does not challenge on appeal the denial of the motion to suppress Castellon\u2019s photo identification, his appeal rests in large part on the assertion that the identification was unreliable. We therefore address first Castellon\u2019s identification of Cinnante. We point out that we have examined the photo arrays and the various photographs in this case. These photo arrays are not overly suggestive and the trial court\u2019s denial of the suppression motion was proper. Before he saw the photos, Castellon\u2019s physical description of Cinnante was an accurate one \u2014 about six feet tall, light colored hair, thick mous-tache, blue eyes, bright teeth. Castell\u00f3n was within two to three feet of Cinnante for at least half an hour at the House of Pancakes. Remarkably, he was able to select Cinnante\u2019s 1980 photograph out of an array of eight clean-shaven people. The accuracy of Castellon\u2019s recollection is underscored by the fact that after drawing a moustache on a photocopy of that photo, he said that it looked like \u201cSteven\u201d but would not make a positive identification because the photo depicted a younger man than the one he had met. When he saw an up-to-date photo of Cinnante in a non-suggestive array of ten, he identified it as \u201cSteven,\u201d although he first compared the two arrays containing Cinnante\u2019s photo. There is no evidence that the cafeteria encounter was prearranged; not surprisingly Castell\u00f3n was shocked to find himself standing behind the man against whom he was to testify. Moreover, it is a fact that Cin-nante\u2019s first two names are Steven and John. While the taped conversations between Serna and Castell\u00f3n were admitted only against Serna, they substantiate Cas-tellon\u2019s testimony that the man he met at the House of Pancakes was known as \u201cSteven\u201d and \u201cJohn.\u201d Thus, the possibility that Castell\u00f3n was framing Cinnante, as Cinnante suggests in connection with his motion for a new trial, is remote at best.</p>\n<p id=\"b923-10\">Cinnante claims that his motion for a new trial based on newly discovered evidence was improperly denied. The newly discovered evidence relates to \u201cBenji,\u201d whom appellant\u2019s counsel alleges to be Benjamin Lee Weinstein, a Boca Raton resident who has a moustache somewhat similar to Cinnante\u2019s. The Government recovered a telephone message slip in Chupurdy\u2019s New Jersey motel room noting that a \u201cBenji\u201d with the phone number 766-4177 had called him, apparently from San Francisco, on the morning of April 2, while Chupurdy was picking up the container. <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"848\">*848</page-number>Chupurdy\u2019s address book, also confiscated by the DEA, contains the name Ben B. and the same number, which indeed is the beeper number of Mr. Weinstein.</p>\n<p id=\"b924-4\">All of these things are very interesting and there is a considerable resemblance between Weinstein and Cinnante, at least as the two men appear in their driver\u2019s license photographs, and as Weinstein appears in a photograph taken at a party with cocktail glass in hand. Unlike Cinnante, however, Weinstein does not match Castel-lon\u2019s original description of \u201cSteven\u201d as about six feet tall with dirtyish blond hair; Weinstein appears to have darker hair and is about five feet eight inches.</p>\n<p id=\"b924-5\">Cinnante argues that if he had known of the message slip and had been able to locate \u201cBenji\u201d before trial he might well have created reasonable doubt in the mind of at least one juror. He claims that the Government\u2019s failure to turn over the message slip violated <em>Brady v. Maryland, </em>373 U.S. 83, 83 S.Ct. 1194, 10 L.Ed.2d 215 (1963). But <em>Brady </em>applies only to evidence favorable to the accused. <em>Id. </em>at 87, 83 S.Ct. at 1196-97. Prior to Cinnante\u2019s new trial motion, the Government, which had been unable to discover Benji\u2019s identity, simply had no basis to believe the slip had any relevance to this case. Moreover, in light of Castellon\u2019s certain identification of Cinnante, the appellant has failed to show \u201ca reasonable probability that, had the evidence been disclosed to the defense, the result of the proceeding would have been different.\u201d <em>United States v. Bagley, </em>\u2014 U.S.-, 105 S.Ct. 3375, 3384, 87 L.Ed.2d 481 (1985). Having failed to meet <em>Bagley\u2019s </em>\u201creasonable probability\u201d standard, Cinnante also fails to meet the higher standard for a new trial based on newly discovered evidence \u2014 that the new evidence \u201cwould probably lead to an acquittal.\u201d <em>United States v. Gilbert, </em>668 F.2d 94, 96 (2d Cir.1981), ce<em>rt. denied, </em>456 U.S. 946, 102 S.Ct. 2014, 72 L.Ed.2d 469 (1982); <em>see also United States v. Alessi, </em>638 F.2d 466, 479 (2d Cir.1980).</p>\n<p id=\"b924-11\">We also reject appellants\u2019 claim that certain hearsay evidence was improperly excluded. Cinnante argues that he should have been permitted to offer into evidence Serna\u2019s comment to a DEA agent that Cinnante was the \u201cwrong man.\u201d After a pretrial hearing Judge Platt found that this comment was inadmissible under Fed.R.Crim.P. 11(e)(6)(D) because it was made in the course of plea negotiations.<footnotemark>1</footnotemark> Whether a party is engaged in plea discussions is a factual question that must be determined on a case-by-case basis. <em>See United States v. Grant, </em>622 F.2d 308, 312 (8th Cir.1980). We have little difficulty in concluding that Serna had entered into plea discussions with the Government at the time he made the statement. Prior to trial, Serna and his retained counsel met with an Assistant United States Attorney and two DEA agents to discuss the possibility of Serna\u2019s cooperation with the Government. General guidelines were discussed at this meeting, but Serna was not questioned on his role as a drug dealer. The AUSA indicated that statements made by Serna would not be used against him and Serna was informed that his cooperation would be made known to the sentencing judge, but that the cooperation had to be total. To determine Serna\u2019s sincerity in cooperating, a DEA agent interviewed him in the presence of his counsel. No Government attorney was present. Serna was less than forthcoming, although he did admit his involvement in importing the container. When asked about Cinnante\u2019s involvement, according to the agent, Serna shook his head and \u201cmay have said, you have the wrong person or indicated that no, no, you\u2019re talking about the wrong man.\u201d At this point the agent decided that Serna\u2019s <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"849\">*849</page-number>professed cooperation was a sham and terminated the interview, and no further plea discussions were held. In light of the initial meeting with the AUSA, this preliminary discussion must be considered as part of the overall plea bargaining process. A requirement that such negotiations be more formal would contravene Rule 11(e)(6) by discouraging plea bargaining. <em>See United States v. Levy, </em>578 F.2d 896, 901 (2d Cir.1978); <em>see also Santobello v. New York, </em>404 U.S. 257, 261, 92 S.Ct. 495, 498, 30 L.Ed.2d 427 (1971). Although the rule prohibits use of statements only \u201cagainst the defendant who ... was a participant in the plea discussion,\u201d and the statement was sought to be admitted only in favor of a codefendant, if Cinnante had been allowed to introduce the statement into evidence there is a strong likelihood that the jury would have considered it as evidence against Serna. A limiting instruction would have been ineffective to protect Serna from the devastating impact of the statement that was tantamount to a confession. Cf<em>. Bruton v. United States, </em>391 U.S. 123, 129, 88 S.Ct. 1620, 1624, 20 L.Ed.2d 476 (1968). Of course, had Cinnante been tried separately from his codefendant, Rule 11 would not have prevented introduction of Serna\u2019s statement.</p>\n<p id=\"b925-5\">A somewhat more difficult question is raised by the absence of a Government attorney when the excluded statement was made, since Rule 11(e)(6)(D) requires that the statement be made \u201cin the course of plea discussions with <em>an attorney </em>for the government\u201d (emphasis added). The Notes of the Advisory Committee on Rules to the 1979 amendments indicate that the requirement of an attorney\u2019s presence was added to prevent the exclusion of statements made to Government agents when there has been no participation of a Government attorney. <em>See, e.g., United States v. Herman, </em>544 F.2d 791 (5th Cir.1977). We think the rule can be fairly read to require the <em>participation </em>of a Government attorney in the plea discussions, but not necessarily his physical <em>presence </em>when a particular statement is made to agents whom the attorney has authorized to engage in plea discussions. <em>See Grant, </em>622 F.2d at 313. Because the agents were acting under the AUSA\u2019s authority in determining whether Serna would in fact cooperate, Serna\u2019s statement was properly excluded. We thus have no need to reach the Government\u2019s alternative contention that the statement was inadmissible under Fed.R.Evid. 804(b)(3).</p>\n<p id=\"b925-7\">Cinnante and Serna also argue that the trial judge erred in excluding hearsay evidence from the transcript of Chupurdy\u2019s testimony at his trial. Chupurdy had testified that he did not attend any meeting at the House of Pancakes and that he did not know either Serna or \u201cSteven.\u201d The same Assistant United States Attorney prosecuted both Chupurdy and Serna and Cinnante, and Castell\u00f3n testified in both trials about the House of Pancakes meeting. Appellants contend that Chupurdy\u2019s testimony fits within the hearsay exception of Fed.R.Evid. 804(b)(1). However, the rule requires that the declarant be unavailable as a witness and the Government have had an opportunity and similar motive to cross-examine the witness at the previous trial. Cinnante\u2019s counsel served Chupurdy with a trial subpoena, and Chupurdy indicated through his attorney that he would invoke the Fifth Amendment. Judge Platt apparently accepted the representation that Chupurdy was unavailable, although he held no hearing on this question. Because Castellon\u2019s credibility was a key issue in Chupurdy\u2019s case, the prosecutor arguably had a motive to cross-examine Chupurdy on his claim that he had not attended a House of Pancakes meeting. However, since cross-examination was unlikely to shake Chupurdy\u2019s denial of such a meeting, the prosecutor, wisely, we think, chose to focus his cross-examination on the details of Chupurdy\u2019s transportation of the container to show that his claim of ignorance of its contents was unbelievable, rather than to emphasize to the jury Chupurdy\u2019s denial of any House of Pancakes meeting. Thus, exclusion of Chupurdy\u2019s statements was not an abuse of the trial court\u2019s discretion <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"850\">*850</page-number>since the prosecutor had no real motive to explore Chupurdy\u2019s earlier statements.</p>\n<p id=\"b926-4\">Judge Platt, however, did not categorically exclude the statements under Rule 804(b)(1). Instead, he offered to admit them conditioned on informing the jury that Chupurdy\u2019s \u201cjury didn\u2019t believe him and found him guilty and he\u2019s doing five years in jail.\u201d Defense counsel rejected this offer. Under Fed.R.Evid. 806 the credibility of such hearsay \u201cmay be attacked ... by any evidence which would be admissible for those purposes if [the] declarant had testified as a witness.\u201d Since the conviction cast doubt on the credibility of Chupurdy\u2019s statements, conditioning admission of that hearsay evidence on informing the jury of the conviction was not an abuse of discretion. <em>See, e.g., United States v. Noble, </em>754 F.2d 1324, 1331 (7th Cir.), <em>cert. denied, </em>\u2014 U.S. -, 106 S.Ct. 63, 88 L.Ed.2d 51 (1985).</p>\n<p id=\"b926-7\">Cinnante and Serna also claim that the trial court improperly excluded expert witness testimony proffered on Castellon\u2019s identification of Cinnante. We have carefully examined the expert\u2019s voir dire and find that the ruling was not clearly erroneous. <em>See United States v. Brown, </em>776 F.2d 397, 400 (2d Cir.1985). A trial judge is accorded broad discretion in admitting or excluding expert testimony under Fed.R.Evid. 702 and in excluding testimony under Fed. R. Evid. 403 because of the danger of jury confusion or unfair prejudice. <em>See id. </em>at 400, 401 &amp; n. 6 (citing <em>United States v. Young, </em>745 F.2d 733, 765-66 (2d Cir.1984) (Newman, J., concurring), <em>cert. denied, </em>\u2014 U.S. -, 105 S.Ct. 1842, 85 L.Ed.2d 142 (1985)). The expert here was ignorant of the conditions under which Castellon identified Cinnante\u2019s photograph and his proposed testimony basically consisted of general pronouncements about the lack of reliability of eyewitness identification, particularly cross-racial identification. He also acknowledged that many of his conclusions coincided with common sense. This court is fully aware of the dangers of testimony based purely on eyewitness identification, and we have often commented on those dangers. <em>See, e.g., Kampshoff v. Smith, </em>698 F.2d 581, 585-86 (2d Cir.1983). Nevertheless, we do not think that this expert\u2019s proffered testimony would have done anything other than to muddy the waters.</p>\n<p id=\"b926-11\">Given that Castellon\u2019s photo identification of Cinnante was properly admitted, Cinnante\u2019s sufficiency argument is without merit. The evidence shows that Cinnante was a broker for the sale of the two and one-half ton marijuana shipment, hired the truckdriver, directed the transportation, and set up the contemplated sale of the shipment; he was also a major cocaine customer of Serna\u2019s and owed the latter $800,000 for cocaine delivered. This evidence is more than sufficient to uphold his conviction on the possession and conspiracy charges, given the appellant\u2019s very heavy burden on a sufficiency of the evidence claim.</p>\n<p id=\"b926-12\">Finally, Serna claims that the trial court improperly admitted the drug ledger in evidence against him. Although Jairo Perez, who handed over the drug ledger and who was carrying the briefcase filled with Serna\u2019s papers, did not testify at trial, Tripicchio testified that Perez told the agents that the ledger was Serna\u2019s and Castell\u00f3n testified that he recognized it as Serna\u2019s because on several occasions he had seen it in Serna\u2019s possession when delivering money to Serna for previous cocaine deliveries. Indeed, Castell\u00f3n identified a section in the ledger referring to \u201cMarco\u201d as the account of his own cocaine purchases. Under Fed.R.Evid. 901(a) the Government \u201cneed only prove a rational basis from which the jury may conclude that the exhibit did, in fact, belong to the appellant[].\u201d <em>United States v. Natale, </em>526 F.2d 1160, 1173 (2d Cir.1975), <em>cert. denied, </em>425 U.S. 950, 96 S.Ct. 1724, 48 L.Ed.2d 193 (1976). Here, the testimony of Tripicchio and Castell\u00f3n made out a prima facie case connecting the exhibit to the defendant; the evidence was thus properly submitted to the jury for a determination on its authenticity. <em>See United States v. Goichman, </em>547 F.2d 778, 784 (3d Cir.1976). We <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"851\">*851</page-number>think the ledger was duly authenticated and properly admitted.</p>\n<p id=\"b927-5\">Judgment affirmed.</p>\n<footnote label=\"1\">\n<p id=\"b924-8\">.
