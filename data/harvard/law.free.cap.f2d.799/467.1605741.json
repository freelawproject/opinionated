The district court denied Morgan\u2019s motion to suppress evidence obtained through a warrant-less search prior to formal arrest. The district court concluded that the search was valid as incident to arrest because, before the search occurred, the police officer had probable cause to arrest Morgan. We affirm.</p>\n<p id=\"b545-23\">BACKGROUND</p>\n<p id=\"b545-24\">On June 6, 1985, a savings and loan in Marysville, California was robbed. The tellers at the savings and loan described the robber as a white male over six feet tall, wearing a plaid shirt, of medium build, with blue eyes, unkempt brown hair and beard, and with an odor of wine about his person. Based upon the robber\u2019s appearance and odor, the tellers concluded that the robber was a transient. Witnesses followed the robber to an area of Marysville known as the \u201criver bottom,\u201d which serves as a hobo camp for transients. That evening, a cab driver reported to Marysville Police Officer Nason that he had heard the description of the robber on his scanner radio and had taken a passenger matching the robber\u2019s description from near the river bottom area to Veda\u2019s Motel in Yuba City. Nason communicated this information to Yuba City Police Sergeant Conklin and Police Officer Cotton, who both accompanied Nason to Veda\u2019s Motel. All three officers were in uniform and armed.</p>\n<p id=\"b546-3\"><page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"468\">*468</page-number>The motel manager confirmed that a person answering the robber\u2019s description had recently checked in, and gave Nason the suspect\u2019s room number. Cotton stationed himself behind the motel to cover the rear windows. Conklin and Nason then went to the suspect\u2019s room. Nason knocked on the door and Morgan answered. Nason explained to Morgan that they were investigating the savings and loan robbery and asked Morgan\u2019s permission to enter the room. Morgan unchained the door and allowed the officers into the room. Nason then asked whether he could look around the room and Morgan consented. While Nason briefly searched the room and the bathroom, Conklin remained inside the room between Morgan and the door. The district court found that, at this time, Morgan was not free to leave the motel room. The search yielded nothing of evidentiary value.</p>\n<p id=\"b546-4\">Conklin observed a bulge in Morgan\u2019s pocket, and, fearing that Morgan might be armed,<footnotemark>1</footnotemark> conducted a pat-down search. In conducting the pat-down, Conklin squeezed the bulge in Morgan\u2019s pocket to make sure it was not a weapon. Conklin asked Morgan what the bulge was, and Morgan replied that it was \u201cmy money.\u201d Conklin testified that he accepted Morgan\u2019s explanation that what he had felt was a roll of money and not a weapon. Conklin then reached into Morgan\u2019s pocket and pulled out a large roll of money with a $100 bill secured around the outside by a rubber band. Conklin asked Morgan how much money there was, and Morgan replied that there was around $1300. When asked where the money came from, Morgan stated that he had quit his job and had cashed a check at a bank in Santa Barbara. Na-son asked Morgan whether he had been in Marysville that day and whether he had taken a cab from Marysville to the motel. Morgan answered \u201cno\u201d to both questions.</p>\n<p id=\"b546-5\">Nason then asked Morgan if he would accompany the officers to the Marysville Police Department for fingerprinting and photographing. Morgan asked if he was under arrest and Nason told him that he was not. Morgan replied that if he was not under arrest, he would prefer not to go to the Police Department. Nason then arranged for the cab driver to come to the motel. When the cab driver arrived, he identified Morgan as the man he had driven from Marysville earlier that day. At that point, Nason formally arrested Morgan.</p>\n<p id=\"b546-8\">Nason then requested Cotton to take Morgan down to the police car. By radio, Nason asked Cotton to \u201cMirandize\u201d Morgan, and also indicated that there was still some money missing. Informed of his rights, Morgan told Cotton that he did not want to make a statement. Cotton then removed Morgan\u2019s wallet and found money that was later determined to be \u201cbait\u201d money from the robbery.</p>\n<p id=\"b546-9\">At trial, Morgan argued that there was no probable cause for his arrest, and moved to suppress the money obtained from the search of his pocket in the motel and all other incriminating evidence that followed the search and arrest. The district court denied Morgan\u2019s motion. Morgan entered a conditional guilty plea pursuant to Fed.R.Crim.P. 11(a)(2), and was subsequently sentenced. Morgan timely appealed.</p>\n<p id=\"b546-10\">STANDARD OF REVIEW</p>\n<p id=\"b546-11\">The district court\u2019s conclusion that Conklin had probable cause to arrest Morgan at the time of the warrantless search is a mixed question of law and fact which we review <em>de novo. United States v. Fouche, </em>778 F.2d 1398, 1403 (9th Cir.1985). However, we review only for clear error the factual findings on which the district court based its conclusion of probable cause. <em>United States v. Merriweather, 777 </em>F.2d 503, 505 (9th Cir.1985), <em>cert. denied, </em>\u2014 U.S. -, 106 S.Ct. 1497, 89 L.Ed.2d 898 (1986).</p>\n<p id=\"b546-14\">ANALYSIS</p>\n<p id=\"b546-15\">The fourth amendment generally requires that police officers obtain a search <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"469\">*469</page-number>warrant before searching a suspect\u2019s person or property. Conklin did not have a warrant to search Morgan\u2019s person. To uphold the search, therefore, some exception to the warrant requirement must apply. <em>United States v. Al-Azzawy, </em>784 F.2d 890, 894 (9th Cir.1985), <em>cert. denied, </em>\u2014 U.S. -, 106 S.Ct. 2255, 90 L.Ed.2d 700 (1986).</p>\n<p id=\"b547-7\">Before the district court, the government argued that Conklin\u2019s search of Morgan\u2019s pocket was either a consensual search or a valid pat-down sanctioned by <em>Terry v. Ohio, </em>392 U.S. 1, 27, 88 S.Ct. 1868, 1883, 20 L.Ed.2d 889 (1968). The district court rejected both asserted justifications and the government does not press either here on appeal. Rather, the government urges us to accept the district court\u2019s rationale that Conklin had probable cause to arrest Morgan before the search, and that Conklin seized the money pursuant to a valid search incident to arrest.</p>\n<p id=\"b547-8\"><em>Chimel v. California, </em>395 U.S. 752, 762-63, 89 S.Ct. 2034, 2039-40, 23 L.Ed.2d 685 (1969), established that a police officer may conduct a warrantless, full search of a suspect\u2019s person incident to a lawful arrest. The precise timing of the search incident to arrest is not critical. In <em>Rawlings v. Kentucky, </em>448 U.S. 98, 100 S.Ct. 2556, 65 L.Ed.2d 633 (1980), officers discovered controlled substances that Rawlings claimed to be his. The officers then searched Rawl-ings and found cash and a knife in his pocket. <em>Id. </em>at 101, 100 S.Ct. at 2559. The Supreme Court upheld the seizure of the knife and cash as a valid search incident to arrest. \u201cOnce [Rawlings] admitted ownership of the sizable quantity of drugs found in Cox\u2019s purse, the police clearly had probable cause to place [Rawlings] under arrest. Where the formal arrest followed quickly on the heels of the challenged search of [Rawlings\u2019] person, we do not believe it particularly important that the search preceded the arrest rather than vice versa.\u201d <em>Id. </em>at 111, 100 S.Ct. at 2564.</p>\n<p id=\"b547-9\">Of course, an arrest that follows a search must be supported by probable cause independent of the fruits of the search. <em>See Rawlings, </em>448 U.S. at 111 n. 6, 100 S.Ct. at 2564 n. 6; <em>Sibron v. New York, </em>392 U.S. 40, 63, 88 S.Ct. 1889, 1903, 20 L.Ed.2d 917 (1968). Thus, here, the role of money and all other evidence obtained from Morgan as a result of Conklin\u2019s search may not be used to establish probable cause for Morgan\u2019s arrest. Therefore, in reviewing the validity of the search we must decide whether Conklin had probable cause to arrest Morgan <em>immediately before </em>the search.</p>\n<p id=\"b547-11\">Probable cause is a practical, nontechnical concept. <em>Brinegar v. United States, </em>338 U.S. 160, 175-76, 69 S.Ct. 1302, 1310-11, 93 L.Ed. 1879 (1949). Conklin had probable cause to arrest Morgan if \u201cunder the totality of the circumstances known to the arresting officers, a prudent person would have concluded that there was a fair probability\u201d that Morgan had committed a crime. <em>United States v. Smith, </em>790 F.2d 789, 792 (9th Cir.1986). <em>See also Illinois v. Gates, </em>462 U.S. 213, 230-46, 103 S.Ct. 2317, 2328-36, 76 L.Ed.2d 527 (1983) (applying \u201ctotality of the circumstances\u201d test to probable cause determination).</p>\n<p id=\"b547-12\">We think Conklin had probable cause to arrest Morgan before he searched Morgan\u2019s pocket. Morgan\u2019s physical appearance and odor conformed closely to the tellers\u2019 general description of the robber of the savings and loan. The officers\u2019 consented-to search of Morgan\u2019s room revealed a wine bottle, a few personal possessions and no luggage, all consistent with a conclusion that Morgan was a transient. Conklin knew that the taxi driver had identified the person he had taken to the motel as someone who closely matched the tellers\u2019 description of the robber. The motel manager had made a similarly positive identification. Conklin also knew that the taxi driver had taken his fare from near the river bottom area, where the suspect had been last seen heading, to Veda\u2019s Motel. Finally, in a justified pat-down, Conklin had squeezed the large bulge in Morgan\u2019s pocket, and had accepted Morgan\u2019s explanation that it was money. From his experience, Conklin could reasonably conclude that <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"470\">*470</page-number>Morgan had a substantial sum, and that it was improbable, though admittedly not impossible, that someone of Morgan's appearance would have acquired that much money lawfully. Given the totality of the circumstances \u2014 the taxi driver\u2019s assertion that his fare\u2019s description matched that of the robber, the motel manager\u2019s independent corroborating identification, Morgan\u2019s appearance and odor, the absence of luggage, and Morgan\u2019s possession of a substantial cash sum \u2014 Conklin, at that moment, had sufficient probable cause to arrest Morgan for the savings and loan robbery.</p>\n<p id=\"b548-4\">That the officers did not formally arrest Morgan at once but waited for the additional corroboration of the taxi driver shows commendable caution on their part. However, it does not vitiate the presence of sufficient probable cause to justify an arrest earlier than the officers apparently considered appropriate in the circumstances. Because we conclude that Conklin in fact had probable cause to arrest Morgan before he removed the money from Morgan\u2019s pocket, the search was valid under <em>Rawlings </em>as incident to an arrest. The money found in Morgan\u2019s pocket was, therefore, admissible as evidence.</p>\n<p id=\"b548-5\">Apart from the money Conklin took from Morgan\u2019s pocket, Morgan also sought to suppress three other items of evidence. The discovery of the bait money and the bank tellers\u2019 later identifications of Morgan both occurred after the officers had formally arrested Morgan and warned him of his <em>Miranda </em>rights. Because we conclude there was probable cause to arrest Morgan earlier than the formal arrest, this evidence, <em>a fortiori, </em>must be admissible. The government stipulated to the district court that Morgan\u2019s statements made immediately after Conklin seized the money were inadmissible as they occurred before Cotton had administered the <em>Miranda </em>warning to Morgan. There is ample evidence to support Morgan\u2019s conviction without these statements.</p>\n<p id=\"b548-6\">AFFIRMED.</p>\n<footnote label=\"1\">\n<p id=\"b546-6\">.
