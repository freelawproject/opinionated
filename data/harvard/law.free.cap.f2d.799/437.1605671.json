Appellees, E.B. Bennett and his wholly owned company, Enterprise Tools, Inc., purchased a \u201ccomprehensive services export credit insurance policy\u201d in 1980 in connection with petroleum hauling operations to be conducted in Mexico. In order to conduct the fuel transport servic<page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"439\">*439</page-number>es, appellees created a Mexican entity, Sociedad Transportadora de Gas y Diesel de Reynosa, S.A. (Gas Transport), which contracted directly with the Mexican government-owned oil monopoly, Petroleos Mexicanos (Pemex), which needed the transport services. Appellees provided ten trucks for the purposes of the enterprise and held a financial interest in Gas Transport.</p>\n<p id=\"b517-5\">Within less than a year after hauling operations began, most of the trucks were seized by agencies of the Mexican government, and appellees have been unable to recover them. Appellees, as the insured,<footnotemark>2</footnotemark> sought to recover the value of the confiscated trucks from Eximbank under the policy. Eximbank denied coverage on the ground that the insurance policy covered only credit losses caused by any of a comprehensive list of enumerated risks such as customer default, currency inconvertibility, war or expropriation, but did not cover the value of the insured\u2019s assets (other than accounts receivable) lost through any of the enumerated hazards. The district court found the policy ambiguous and construed it as asset protection as well as credit protection insurance. Because we conclude that the policy did not provide coverage for the value of the insured\u2019s confiscated equipment, we reverse.</p>\n<p id=\"b517-12\">Normal principles of contract interpretation apply to the construction of insurance policies. 2 COUCH, CYCLOPEDIA OF INSURANCE LAW \u00a7 15:1 (2d ed. 1984). Words and clauses are to be given their ordinary meaning and effect, and resort to extrinsic evidence is appropriate only to resolve ambiguities. <em>Id. </em>\u00a7 15:3. Whether an insurance contract is ambiguous is a question of law. <em>Id. </em>Policy language is ambiguous if it is \u201creasonably susceptible of two interpretations.\u201d <em>Pearce v. General American Life Insurance Co., </em>637 F.2d 536, 539 (8th Cir.1980). On the other hand, where a term is defined in the policy, the court is bound by the policy definition. <em>Id. Accord </em>2 COUCH, <em>supra, </em>at \u00a7 15:4. Clauses must be read in context. <em>Verlo v. Equitable Life Assurance Society of the United States, </em>562 F.2d 1034, 1036 (8th Cir.1977). Ascertaining the parties\u2019 intent as expressed in the policy is the object of construction of the document. 2 COUCH, <em>supra, </em>at \u00a7\u00a7 15:9-15:11. While ambiguities are to be construed in favor of the insured, a court may not rewrite the contract. <em>Id. </em>at \u00a7 15:10.</p>\n<p id=\"b517-13\">The Eximbank policy provided two types of coverage: \u201cCoverage A \u2014 Commercial Credit Risks\u201d and \u201cCoverage B \u2014 Political Risks.\u201d Coverage A indemnified the insured for \u201closs\u201d<footnotemark>3</footnotemark> incurred in connection <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"440\">*440</page-number>with \u201ccovered services\u201d caused by the \u201ccustomer\u2019s\u201d (1) insolvency or (2) substantially overdue payment of amounts owed the insured under the \u201cservice contract.\u201d A reading of the contract in its entirety, particularly the definitions, establishes that \u201ccovered services\u201d referred to the petroleum hauling services undertaken for Pemex; that the \u201ccustomer\u201d meant Pemex, and that the \u201cservice contract\u201d referred to the agreement between the insured (via Gas Transport) and Pemex.</p>\n<p id=\"b518-4\">Coverage B included two subsections: \u201c1. Transfer Risk\u201d and \u201c2. Other Political Risks.\u201d Transfer risk contemplated the loss of contract payments to the insured caused by the inability of the customer\u2019s government to transfer local currency into United States currency. The Coverage A commercial credit risks and Coverage B(l.) currency convertibility risk are not at issue in this case. However, Coverages A and B(l.) unambiguously indemnified the insured only for unpaid contract payments, i.e., accounts receivable, rendered uncollectible or remaining uncollected by the insured from Pemex because of commercial and convertibility events. These sections included no language which could possibly be construed to extend beyond credit losses to indemnification of equipment losses.</p>\n<p id=\"b518-5\">Appellees rely on portions of Coverage B(2.) \u201cOther Political Risks\u201d for their position that the policy covered the value of expropriated mobile assets. Coverage B(2.) stated:</p>\n<blockquote id=\"b518-6\">2. Other Political Risks</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b518-7\">a. Eximbank will indemnify the Insured in United States dollars for the percentage stated in the Declarations of the amount of the Insured\u2019s <em>loss </em>incurred in connection with <em>covered services </em>following the occurrence, after <em>commencement of services, </em>of any of the following events:</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b518-12\">(1) [revocation of export license]; or</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b518-13\">(2) the cancellation, under circumstances not due to the fault of the <em>customer </em>or any of its agents, of previously issued and valid authority to import into or to perform such services, or the equipment and material necessary to render the services, in the <em>customer\u2019s </em>country; or</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b518-14\">(3) the imposition of any law or of any order, decree or regulation having the force of law or any other governmental action of a like nature which, under circumstances not due to the fault of the <em>customer </em>or any of its agents, prevents the import into or the performance of such services in the <em>customer\u2019s </em>country.</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b518-15\">b. Eximbank will indemnify the Insured in United States dollars for the percentage stated in the Declarations of the amount of the Insured\u2019s <em>loss </em>incurred in connection with <em>covered services </em>and caused by:</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b518-16\">(1) the occurrence after <em>commencement of services </em>of any of the following events:</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b518-17\">(a) war [and other similar] disturbance^]; or</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b518-18\">(b) requisition, expropriation or confiscation of or intervention in the business of the <em>customer </em>or guarantor by a governmental authority occurring on or before the <em>due date; </em>or</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b518-19\">(c) the imposition of any law or of any order, decree or regulation having the force of law which, under circumstances not due to the fault of the <em>customer </em>or any of its agents, prevents the deposit described in Cover<page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"441\">*441</page-number>age B, paragraph 1, from being made; * * *</blockquote>\n<p id=\"b519-5\">(All emphasis in original.)</p>\n<p id=\"b519-6\">While the foregoing language may be slightly ambiguous, (see, e.g., the reference to equipment in subsection 2.a.(2) and to expropriation or confiscation in subsection 2.b(l)(b)) the key to the nature and extent of the insurer\u2019s liability lies in the definition of \u201closs.\u201d<footnotemark>4</footnotemark> \u201cLoss,\u201d as defined in the definitions section of the policy, meant with respect to fully performed services, the \u201ccontract payment\u201d value less certain offsets.<footnotemark>5</footnotemark> \u201cContract payment\u201d referred to the contract price in United States dollars owed by the insured\u2019s customer for the services rendered by the insured. Thus, the \u201closs\u201d for which the insured was indemnified under Coverage B(2.) was intended to be measured by the dollar amounts owed to the insured under its contract with its customer when political events (e.g., war or confiscation) resulted in nonpayment of the contract price.</p>\n<p id=\"b519-7\">Considering the contract in its entirety, an interpretation of Coverage B which limits Eximbank\u2019s exposure to reimbursing the insured\u2019s uncollectible accounts receivable is consistent with the character of coverage unambiguously established in Coverage A. Similarly, a common sense reading of the policy indicates that the single definition of \u201closs\u201d in the definitions section had the same meaning for Coverages A, B(l.) and B(2.), although loss of accounts receivable could be triggered by different kinds of events or \u201crisks.\u201d</p>\n<p id=\"b519-8\">Furthermore, credit insurance policies typically cover only overdue or uncollecL ible accounts and do not provide asset protection coverage. <em>See </em>9 J. APPLEMAN, INSURANCE LAW AND PRACTICE \u00a7 5241, at 126-27 (1981), describing credit insurance as follows: \u201cIt relates strictly to indemnification of the insured for certain types of overdue accounts, particularly where insolvency of the debtor is concerned . [It is] usually purchased by manufacturers or sellers of products to insure that the sudden insolvencies, or failures to pay on the part of purchasers, will not wholly strip them of operating capital and put them out of business.\u201d <em>See also Manhattan Factoring Corp. v. Orsburn, </em>238 Ark. 947, 385 S.W.2d 785, 789 (1965): \u201cThe business of credit insurance (originally called \u2018commercial insurance\u2019) has existed for many years. The usual form is that for a stated premium paid by the insured, the insurer guarantees the payment, in whole or in part, of the account which the insured has listed under the policy.\u201d</p>\n<p id=\"b519-12\">The manner in which the premium was computed and its amount are also circumstances to be considered in determining the character of the risk which the parties intended the insurer to assume. 9 J. APPLEMAN, <em>supra, </em>\u00a7 5241, at 129-30. <em>Accord U.P. Terminal Federal Credit Union v. Employers Mutual Liability Insurance Co., </em>172 Neb. 190, 196-97, 109 N.W.2d 115, 119 (1961). Premium costs for the Eximbank policy were expressly tied to accounts receivable. Bennett agreed to pay premiums based on a percentage of one-half of one percent of the aggregate contract payment value of the covered services (i.e., of the insured transactions). The policy required him to prepare monthly reports of his gross invoice value from which premium payments were calculated at the rate of $.50 per $100 of then outstanding debt owed to the insured by Pemex. The premiums bore absolutely no relationship to the value of the trucks to be used in the hauling operations.</p>\n<p id=\"b519-13\">In addition, the policy limits were based on Bennett\u2019s anticipated billings, not on the value of equipment used in the insured transactions. Bennett chose a policy limit of $600,000, representing the maximum in receivables he expected to have outstand<page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"442\">*442</page-number>ing at any particular time during the transport operations.</p>\n<p id=\"b520-4\">In fact, the services for Pemex grossed only $33,000 during the eight months of operations, resulting in a fee of $166.13 to which an additional $83.87 was added to meet the minimum annual premium of $250 to keep the policy in force. As opposed to the $250 premium which Bennett actually paid for the Eximbank policy, Bennett\u2019s insurance agent had received a quotation from a competing insurance group, American International Companies, which did offer expropriation insurance. The annual premium for the American International Companies\u2019 expropriation coverage was quoted at $4,894 for Bennett\u2019s ten trucks valued at $750,000. The premium for expropriation coverage by American International Companies was calculated as a percentage of the actual cash value of the equipment less the insured\u2019s deductible and was unrelated to receivables. Similarly, the liability limit was expressly tied to the value of the equipment, unlike the Exim-bank policy.</p>\n<p id=\"b520-5\">While we are charged with resolving policy ambiguities in accordance with the reasonable expectations of the insured, <em>Auto-Owners Insurance Co. v. Jensen, </em>667 F.2d 714, 721 (8th Cir.1981), Bennett and his insurance agent concededly never even read the Eximbank policy before purchasing it. Had they done so, they would have been alerted by subsection IV.C., \u201cLimitations of Liability,\u201d that \u201c * * * the amount of the Insurer\u2019s liability with respect to any one <em>customer </em>[would] in no event with respect to either Coverage A or Coverage B exceed the value of the <em>contract payment, </em>with respect to which the <em>loss </em>has occurred [plus certain costs] * * Once again, this provision linked liability to receivables.</p>\n<p id=\"b520-12\">Robert L. Charamella, Deputy Vice-President of the export division of Eximbank testified that Eximbank and FCIA offer insurance to United States exporters of goods and services covering billings invoiced by the exporters to their overseas customers, but that neither Eximbank nor FCIA offers any policy covering the exporters\u2019 loss of plant or equipment.<footnotemark>6</footnotemark> According to Charamella, other government agencies, e.g., the Overseas Private Investment Corporation, have programs which insure investments in tangible assets overseas as do private insurers, but not Eximbank or its agent FCIA. Nor does Eximbank offer overseas kidnap and ransom coverage which is available privately such as from American International Companies. Thus, Eximbank\u2019s \u201ccomprehensive\u201d export credit insurance contemplates a multitude of possible events, commercial or political, which could precipitate an insured\u2019s credit losses abroad, but does not provide comprehensive coverage for noncredit kinds of losses.</p>\n<p id=\"b520-13\">John Willyard, a vice-president with FCIA during 1980-81, similarly explained the character of credit insurance available from FCIA:</p>\n<blockquote id=\"b520-14\">FCIA\u2019s insurance is designed to protect a company\u2019s receivables. And receivables <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"443\">*443</page-number>in this case would have been the billings for services actually performed under the contract. Now, receivables can be confiscated, expropriated and nationalized through the buyers being confiscated, expropriated or nationalized or in some other way an eligible claim could occur. However, in the sense of having mobile assets confiscated, expropriated or nationalized, we do not deal in any sort of what we call fixed assets, mobile equipment, overseas plant or other types of fixed assets that might be subject to confiscation, nationalization or expropriation overseas.</blockquote>\n<p id=\"b521-5\">Having considered the language of the insurance policy and the extrinsic evidence bearing on the parties\u2019 intent concerning the nature and extent of coverage, the miniscule premium paid and Bennett\u2019s rejection of an opportunity to purchase insurance relating to confiscation of equipment at a much higher price, we conclude that the district court erroneously interpreted the policy. We have also considered appellees\u2019 other contentions regarding fraud and admissions by a party opponent and find them to be without merit.<footnotemark>7</footnotemark> Accordingly, we reverse and remand with directions to dismiss the complaint with prejudice.</p>\n<footnote label=\"1\">\n<p id=\"b516-21\">.

In an exchange with the district court, Chara-mella explained the only circumstance in which the value of expropriated equipment would be covered by an Eximbank/FCIA policy:</p>\n<blockquote id=\"b520-7\">THE COURT: Do you have any policies that cover the equipment?</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b520-8\">CHARAMELLA: No, sir.</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b520-9\">THE COURT: In other words, the equipment is \u2014 let\u2019s just say it's expropriated \u2014 it\u2019s confiscated when it\u2019s down there. There is no policy \u2014 in your view, this policy doesn\u2019t nor do you understand that Exim provides any coverage against that political risk?</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b520-10\">CHARAMELLA: Not so long as the equipment is still in the exporter\u2019s hands. It still\u2014 the title remains with the exporter. <em>If the title of the goods are with the foreign buyer and the products are expropriated by the government and that expropriation leads to an inability of the buyer to pay the invoices, then that particular event is covered. The cover relates to billing invoices. </em>If the exporter has equipment in the country, the Export-Import Bank has no policy which covers the exporter against expropriation of the equipment while it\u2019s in the foreign country.</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"AGL\">THE COURT: I\u2019m having trouble with that. You mean that the Americans, the people who own and have the title to it, if their property is confiscated there's no insurance \u2014 that\u2019s not a political risk as far as you\u2019re concerned?</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"AWS\">CHARAMELLA: That\u2019s correct.</blockquote>\n<p id=\"AP3\">(Emphasis added.)</p>\n</footnote>\n<footnote label=\"7\">\n<p id=\"b521-9\">.
