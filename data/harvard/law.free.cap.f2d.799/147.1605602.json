Ryan was denied surviving child\u2019s insurance benefits under the Social Security Act. This Court, limited in its review to determining whether substantial evidence exists on the record, considering it as a whole, to support the findings below, AFFIRMS. <em>Segovia v. Heckler, </em>768 F.2d 596, 597 (5th Cir.1985).</p>\n<p id=\"b226-15\">This Court has carefully reviewed the administrative record, and it notes that there is ground for difference of opinion on the issue whether Lance Ryan was living with or was supported by his father at the time of his father\u2019s death in 1966. His mother, now deceased, applied for surviving child\u2019s benefits in 1968, at which time she denied both that Lance\u2019s father was living with him at the time of his death and that he was contributing to the support of Lance. In a later application for surviving child\u2019s benefits, filed by Lance\u2019s aunt with whom he lived, there is a suggestion that Lance\u2019s mother lived with Raymond Van Matre during 1966. Lance\u2019s father, in the meantime, was married to another woman, by whom he sired a child in 1963, a year after Lance\u2019s birth.</p>\n<p id=\"b226-16\">On Lance\u2019s side, both he (who was four years old at the time) and his half-bother state their recollection of having lived with Lance\u2019s father. A letter written by Lance\u2019s mother in March, 1969, indicates that she lived with Lance\u2019s father in New Orleans and in Atlanta, but the dates of cohabitation are not specified.</p>\n<p id=\"b226-17\">In short, there is conflicting evidence on the issue (not all of which is recited above), and the administrative law judge\u2019s determination must be respected because it is supported by substantial credible evidence.</p>\n<p id=\"b226-18\">We AFFIRM the judgment of the district court.</p>\n</opinion>\n</casebody>\n",
