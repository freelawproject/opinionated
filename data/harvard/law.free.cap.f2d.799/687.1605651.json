(\u201cGardinier\u201d), is engaged in mining and processing phosphate ore and manufacturing fertilizers and other chemical products at its Tampa Chemical plant located in Hillsborough County, Florida. On June 30, 1977, the United States Environmental Protection Agency (\u201cEPA\u201d or \u201cAgency\u201d) issued Gardinier a five-year National Pollution Discharge Elimination System (\u201cNPDES\u201d) permit regulating discharges from this facility.<footnotemark>1</footnotemark></p>\n<p id=\"b764-17\">On May 17, 1979, Gardinier notified the EPA of its plan to make process modifications and to expand plant capacity by 20 per cent. Gardinier also noted that continued operations would require the future development of a disposal area for \u201cphos-phogypsum,\u201d a waste product of the phosphate process. Gardinier proposed that environmental review of the disposal area be conducted simultaneously with that for the plant process modifications and capacity expansion and, on October 4, requested that the EPA make a formal initial determination as to whether its proposed process modifications constituted a \u201cnew source.\u201d<footnotemark>2</footnotemark> EPA issued its initial determination that <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"689\">*689</page-number>the plant modifications constituted a new source for NPDES permitting purposes on November 1, 1979.<footnotemark>3</footnotemark></p>\n<p id=\"arc-dedup-1\">On October 30, 1980, the EPA issued an environmental assessment (\u201cEA\u201d) and a \u201cfinding of no significant impact\u201d (\u201cFON-SI\u201d) concerning both Gardinier\u2019s plant modifications and proposed phosphogypsum disposal area.<footnotemark>4</footnotemark> The Agency concluded that no significant impact on environmental quality was present.<footnotemark>5</footnotemark> The EPA also issued public notice initiating a thirty-day public comment period on its initial new source determination, its environmental review and its draft proposed modified NPDES permit. The notice contained information on procedures for making both public hearing requests to supplement written corn-ments, and for requesting an evidentiary hearing subsequent to the Agency\u2019s final <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"690\">*690</page-number>determination on issuance of the proposed modified permit.<footnotemark>6</footnotemark></p>\n<p id=\"b766-4\">On November 15, 1980, Manasota-88, Inc. (\u201cManasota-88\u201d), a non-profit, environmental organization, submitted its written comments, directing the Agency\u2019s attention to a technical support document prepared in August, 1979, by EPA\u2019s Office of Radiation Programs (\u201cORP\u201d) regarding emissions of \u201cradionuclides\u201d into the atmosphere. On February 24,1981, EPA issued Gardinier a modified NPDES permit effective March 26, 1981, with an expiration date of August 15, 1982. Manasota-88 did not pursue further review of the Agency\u2019s issuance of the modified NPDES permit to Gardinier.</p>\n<p id=\"b766-5\">Prior to the expiration of its modified NPDES permit, Gardinier applied for reis-suance on February 11, 1982. On March 29, 1984, the EPA issued public notice commencing a thirty-day comment period on reissuance of Gardinier\u2019s NPDES permit. Manasota-88 submitted written comments requesting that the Agency prepare an EIS prior to reissuing Gardinier\u2019s NPDES permit. Specifically, Manasota-88 asserted that the Agency\u2019s 1980 FONSI \u201cwas based upon limited and inaccurate information\u201d and cited data from the ORP document to which it had referred in submitting its November 15, 1980, comments on the adequacy of the Agency\u2019s environmental review. On May 9, 1984, 'Manasota-88 submitted additional comments combined with a request for an informal public hearing.</p>\n<p id=\"b766-8\">On September 20, 1984, the Agency held a public hearing in which Manasota-88 presented additional comments with respect to radon emissions from the proposed phosphogypsum disposal area. The EPA agreed with Manasota-88 that the Agency\u2019s 1980 FONSI, \u201calthough it was adequate at the time of issuance, does not reflect [what] appears to be additional information ... [and that, the Agency would] study the specific issue regarding radioactivity emissions from ... gyp stacks\u201d. However, a week later, on September 28, 1984, the EPA reissued Gardinier\u2019s NPDES permit effective November 1,1984, with an expiration date of October 31, 1989. Written notice of this permit determination was issued on October 22, 1984.</p>\n<p id=\"b766-9\">Manasota-88 responded to the Agency\u2019s notice of its final determination by filing a Request for Evidentiary Hearing on November 19, 1984. Manasota-88 contended that the 1980 FONSI was erroneous and required the Agency to develop a full-scale EIS prior to reissuance of Gardinier\u2019s NPDES permit. The Agency\u2019s Region IV Administrator concluded that the request failed to raise any material issue of fact, <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"691\">*691</page-number>and that the relevant legal objections were not well taken. Accordingly, he denied Ma-nasota-88\u2019s evidentiary hearing request on April 18,1985. The EPA Administrator, on appeal, denied review of the permit reis-suance determination on August 2, 1985. Manasota-88 timely filed its petition for review in this court on October 29, 1985.</p>\n<p id=\"b767-5\">STANDARD OF REVIEW</p>\n<p id=\"b767-6\">Generally speaking, the court\u2019s review of an agency\u2019s final decision is governed by the Administrative Procedure Act (\u201cAPA\u201d), 5 U.S.C. \u00a7\u00a7 701 <em>et seq. </em>Under this statute, the \u201creviewing court shall ... hold unlawful and set aside agency actions, findings and conclusions found to be \u2014 arbitrary, capricious, an abuse of discretion, or otherwise not in accordance with law.\u201d 5 U.S.C. \u00a7 706(2)(A). This deferential standard presumes the validity of the agency action and prohibits a reviewing court from substituting its judgment for that of the agency. <em>See Citizens to Preserve Overton Park v. Volpe, </em>401 U.S. 402, 413-14, 91 S.Ct. 814, 822, 28 L.Ed.2d 136 (1971). \u201cAdministrative decisions should be set aside in this context, as in every other, only for substantial procedural or substantive reasons as mandated by statute ... not simply because the court is unhappy with the result reached.\u201d <em>Vermont Yankee Nuclear Power Corp. v. Natural Resources Defense Council, Inc., </em>435 U.S. 519, 558, 98 S.Ct. 1197, 1219, 55 L.Ed.2d 460 (1979).</p>\n<p id=\"b767-7\">The courts\u2019 proper function in reviewing an agency\u2019s action is to determine whether the agency has \u201cconsidered the relevant factors and articulated a rational connection between the facts found and the choices made.\u201d <em>Baltimore Gas &amp; Electric Co. v. Natural Resources Defense Council, Inc., </em>462 U.S. 87, 105, 103 S.Ct. 2246, 2256, 76 L.Ed.2d 437 (1983); <em>Bowman Transportation, Inc. v. Arkansas-Best Freight System, Inc., </em>419 U.S. 281, 285, 95 S.Ct. 438, 441, 42 L.Ed.2d 447 (1974). To affirm, a court must only determine that the agency had a rational basis for its decision. \u201cWhile we may not supply a reasoned basis for the agency\u2019s action that the agency itself has not given, <em>SEC v. Chen-ery Corp., </em>332 U.S. 194, 196, 67 S.Ct. 1575, 1577, 91 L.Ed. 1995 (1947), we will uphold a decision of less than ideal clarity if the agency\u2019s path may reasonably be discerned.\u201d <em>Bowman, </em>419 U.S. at 285-86, 95 S.Ct. at 442. In the NEPA context \u201c[t]he role of the courts is simply to ensure that the agency has adequately considered and disclosed the environmental impact of its actions and that its decision is not arbitrary or capricious.\u201d <em>Baltimore Gas, </em>462 U.S. at 97-98, 103 S.Ct. at 2252.</p>\n<p id=\"b767-9\">Manasota-88 has urged this court to apply a \u201creasonableness\u201d standard of review to the Agency\u2019s decision to reissue Gardinier\u2019s NPDES permit. According to Manasota-88, the EPA\u2019s decision not to prepare an EIS prior to reissuance requires a higher degree of judicial scrutiny. Although this circuit has not heretofore articulated the standard of review applicable to an agency\u2019s decision not to prepare an EIS, the former Fifth Circuit has held that a reasonableness standard is appropriate. <em>Save Our Ten Acres v. Kreger, </em>472 F.2d 463 (5th Cir.1973).</p>\n<p id=\"b767-10\">In <em>Kreger </em>the court noted that</p>\n<blockquote id=\"AP-f\">[t]he spirit of [NEPA] would die aborning if a facile, ex parte decision that the project was minor or did not significantly affect the environment were too well shielded from impartial review. Every such decision pretermits all consideration of that which Congress has directed be considered \u2018to the fullest extent possible.\u2019 The primary decision to give or bypass the consideration required by [NEPA] must be subject to inspection under a more searching standard.</blockquote>\n<p id=\"b767-11\"><em>Id. </em>at 466. The Fifth Circuit has recently reaffirmed the reasonableness standard of review for an agency decision not to prepare an EIS. <em>See Fritiofson v. Alexander, </em>772 F.2d 1225, 1237 (5th Cir.1985). We, therefore, agree with Manasota-88 that a reasonableness standard is appropriate for <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"692\">*692</page-number>reviewing an agency\u2019s decision not to prepare an EIS.<footnotemark>7</footnotemark></p>\n<p id=\"b768-4\">We cannot, however, agree with Manasota-88\u2019s characterization of the issue in this case as one merely involving the EPA\u2019s refusal to prepare an EIS. The EPA found that Gardinier\u2019s proposed phosphogypsum disposal area was not a new source within the meaning of 33 U.S.C. \u00a7 1316(a)(2). Specifically, the Region IV Administrator found</p>\n<blockquote id=\"b768-5\">that the major modifications proposed by Gardinier have all been completed except for the proposed new gypsum disposal area, which <em>considered alone, </em>would not now, nor in 1979, have resulted in a determination that the Gardinier facility was a new source; hence, no environmental assessment would have been mandated by NEPA, if only a new gypsum disposal area had been proposed.</blockquote>\n<p id=\"b768-6\">As the Agency points out, the pertinent statutory and regulatory provisions make clear that the obligation to prepare an EIS under NEPA does not apply to the NPDES permitting process <em>except as to new sources.</em></p>\n<blockquote id=\"b768-7\">Except for ... the issuance of a permit under section 1342 of this title for the discharge of any pollutant by a new source as defined in section 1316 of this title, <em>no action of the Administrator taken pursuant to this chapter shall be deemed a major federal action significantly affecting the quality of the human environment within the meaning of </em>[NEPA]....\u201d</blockquote>\n<p id=\"b768-10\">33 U.S.C. \u00a7 1371(c)(1) (emphasis added). 40 C.F.R. \u00a7 124.9(b)(6) provides that \u201cNPDES permits, other than permits to new sources ... are not subject to the [EIS] provisions of ... [NEPA].\u201d <em>Cf., Mahelona v. Hawaiian Electric Co., Inc., </em>418 F.Supp. 1328, 1334 (D.Haw.1976) (\u201cThere is no dispute that EPA was required to prepare an EIS only if the discharge facility is a \u2018new source\u2019 \u201d); <em>See generally, Save the Bay, Inc. v. United States Corps of Engineers, </em>610 F.2d 322, 326 (5th Cir.1980); <em>Simons v. Gorsuch, </em>715 F.2d 1248, 1251-52 (7th Cir.1983); Conference Report 92-1236, 92d Cong.2d Sess., <em>reprinted in </em>1972 U.S. CODE CONG. &amp; ADMIN.NEWS, 3668, 3826. Thus, we find that the Agency\u2019s determination that Gardinier\u2019s proposed phosphogypsum facility is not a new source, and hence, its decision to reissue Gardinier\u2019s modified NPDES permit without preparing a full-scale EIS, though subject to a reasonableness standard, would also necessarily withstand an attack under the arbitrary and capricious standard of review as well.<footnotemark>8</footnotemark></p>\n<p id=\"b769-4\"><page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"693\">*693</page-number>DISCUSSION</p>\n<p id=\"b769-5\">I.</p>\n<p id=\"b769-6\">Manasota-88 contends that the EPA\u2019s determination that Gardinier\u2019s proposed phosphogypsum disposal area is not a new source is arbitrary and capricious. Manasota-88 argues that the proposed disposal area constitutes construction activity resulting in a new source within the meaning of the regulations. 40 C.F.R. \u00a7 122.-29(b)(1) provides:</p>\n<blockquote id=\"b769-7\">Except as otherwise provided in an applicable new source performance standard, a source is a \u201cnew source\u201d if it meets the definition of \u201cnew source\u201d in \u00a7 122.2, and</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b769-8\">(i) It is constructed at a site at which no other source is located; or</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b769-9\">(ii) It totally replaces the process or production equipment that causes the discharge of pollutants at an existing source; or</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b769-10\">(iii) Its processes are substantially independent of an existing source at the same site. In determining whether these processes are substantially independent, the Director shall consider such factors as the extent to which the new facility is integrated with the existing plant; and the extent to which the new facility is engaged in the same general type of activity as the existing source.<footnotemark>9</footnotemark></blockquote>\n<p id=\"adv-dedup-0\">Manasota-88 claims that Gardinier\u2019s proposed disposal area will replace the existing disposal area in seven years.</p>\n<p id=\"b769-21\">Manasota-88\u2019s argument is flawed for several reasons. First, as the EPA and Gardinier note, Gardinier\u2019s proposed disposal area and its original proposal for plant capacity expansion were both the subject of EPA\u2019s environmental review in 1980. It follows that the proposed disposal area cannot logically be viewed apart from Gardinier\u2019s plant and entire modification scheme of 1979, since the field will handle phosphogypsum waste from both the original and expanded plant facilities. Second, as is obvious from the record before us, Gardinier has undertaken and completed construction of its expanded plant facilities in reliance on the EPA\u2019s approval in 1981 of the proposed disposal area.<footnotemark>10</footnotemark></p>\n<p id=\"b769-22\">Finally, Gardinier\u2019s plans with respect to the proposed disposal area have not changed since the EPA issued Gardinier\u2019s <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"694\">*694</page-number>modified NPDES permit in 1981. It is apparent that modifications to the proposed disposal facility would support Manasota88\u2019s contention that the area should be viewed as a new source. However, the same proposed disposal facility before the EPA during the Agency\u2019s environmental review in 1980 and issuance of the modified NPDES permit in 1981 continued to be before the EPA during reissuance of the permit in 1984, and continues to be before this court at the present time. Based on the foregoing, we cannot say that the EPA\u2019s determination that the proposed phosphogypsum disposal area is not a new source was arbitrary or capricious, and therefore, that the Agency\u2019s decision not to prepare an EIS was unreasonable. <em>Cf., Burbank Anti-Noise Group v. Goldschmidt, </em>623 F.2d 115, 116 (9th Cir.1980), <em>cert. denied, </em>450 U.S. 965, 101 S.Ct. 1481, 67 L.Ed.2d 614 (1981) (\u201cAn EIS is not required, however, when the proposed federal action will effect no change in the status quo\u201d); <em>Committee for Auto Responsibility v. Saloman, </em>603 F.2d 992, 1002-03 (D.C.Cir.1979), cer<em>t. denied, </em>445 U.S. 915, 100 S.Ct. 1274, 63 L.Ed.2d 599 (1980) (same).</p>\n<p id=\"b770-4\">II.</p>\n<p id=\"b770-5\">Manasota-88 also argues that the EPA has a continuing obligation to implement NEPA as to Gardinier\u2019s proposed phosphogypsum disposal facility and to prepare an EIS because \u201cnew facts\u201d have undermined the adequacy of the EPA\u2019s 1980 environmental review, in general, and the FONSI, in particular. Specifically, Manasota-88 draws this court\u2019s attention to: (1) the EPA\u2019s 1979 ORP report on radionuclide emissions; (2) a statement of the EPA\u2019s Region IY Water Management Division Director during the September 20, 1984, hearing that the Agency\u2019s 1980 FON-SI did not reflect \u201cadditional information\u201d; (3) the EPA\u2019s October 31, 1984, Federal Register notice stating the lifetime risks to health from exposure to air emissions from phosphogypsum sites, including the risk of one fatal cancer per year; and (4) the close proximity (less than 600 feet) of the proposed disposal area to the home of Mr. Dan Lyons.</p>\n<p id=\"b770-7\">We note that Manasota-88 did not challenge the adequacy of the Agency\u2019s environmental review, the scope of the initial new source determination, or the decision to issue Gardinier a modified NPDES permit. Although Manasota-88 has properly challenged the EPA\u2019s decision to reissue the permit, it is barred from attacking the Agency\u2019s determinations which formed the basis of its decision to issue Gardinier a modified permit or the permit decision itself. It follows that the decision to reissue Gardinier\u2019s permit may not be challenged to the extent it is based on the <em>same </em>EPA environmental determinations.</p>\n<p id=\"b770-8\">We do acknowledge, however, that the discovery of new facts or information bearing on the EPA\u2019s decision to issue a NPDES permit could require the Agency to reassess its prior determinations before reissuing the permit. <em>Cf. </em>40 C.F.R. \u00a7 1502 (i)(l) (requiring agencies to prepare a supplemental EIS if there are substantial changes in the proposed action relevant to environmental concerns, or if there are significant new circumstances or information relevant to environmental concerns and bearing on the proposed action or its impacts). Our review of the record discloses no new facts sufficient to require the EPA to reassess its prior determinations, to find that Gardinier\u2019s proposed disposal facility is a new source for NPDES permitting purposes, or to prepare an EIS before reissuing Gardinier\u2019s permit.</p>\n<p id=\"b770-9\">CONCLUSION</p>\n<p id=\"b770-10\">Because we see no grounds on which to disturb the action of the EPA in reissuing Gardinier\u2019s NPDES permit, we dismiss Ma-nasota-88\u2019s petition for review.</p>\n<p id=\"b770-11\">PETITION DISMISSED.</p>\n<footnote label=\"1\">\n<p id=\"b764-13\">. As part of the Clean Water Act (\"CWA\u201d), 33 U.S.C. \u00a7\u00a7 1251 <em>et seq., </em>Congress created the NPDES permit scheme to regulate the discharge of any pollutant to navigable waters. 33 U.S.C. \u00a7 1342(a). \"Discharge of a pollutant\" is defined as \"any addition of any pollutant to navigable waters from any point source.\" 33 U.S.C. \u00a7 1362(12)(A). \"Pollutant\u201d is defined broadly to encompass numerous substances, including all industrial, municipal and agricultural wastes. 33 U.S.C. \u00a7 1362(6). \"Navigable waters\u201d are defined as \"the waters of the United States, including the territorial seas.\u201d 33 U.S.C. \u00a7 1362(7). \u201cPoint source\u201d is defined broadly as \"any discernible, confined and discrete conveyance ... from which pollutants are or may be discharged.\u201d 33 U.S.C. \u00a7 1362(14).

The review is based upon an environmental information document prepared by the permit applicant, from which a written \u201cenvironmental assessment\u201d is prepared. 40 C.F.R. \u00a7 6.604(b) and (c).</p>\n<p id=\"b765-15\">NEPA requires the EPA to determine whether issuance of an initial NPDES permit constitutes a \u201cmajor Federal action significantly affecting the quality of the human environment,\u201d and thus whether an \"environmental impact statement\" must be prepared to assess fully the overall environmental impact of the facility\u2019s operations. 42 U.S.C. \u00a7 4332(2)(C); 40 C.F.R. \u00a7 6.604. The EIS evaluates the significance of the project\u2019s environmental impact by utilizing the specific criteria set out at 40 C.F.R. \u00a7 6.605(b). \"When the environmental review indicates no significant impacts are anticipated or when the proposed project is changed to eliminate the significant adverse impacts, a [FONSI] shall be issued which lists any mitigation measures necessary to make the recommended alternative environmentally acceptable.\u201d 40 C.F.R. \u00a7 6.604(d)(1).

The air quality impacts were assessed as follows:</p>\n<blockquote id=\"b765-19\">The uppermost, exposed section of the proposed gypsum disposal field may become an intermittent source of particulates by wind blown fugitive dust. However, the quantity would be small and the particle weight would preclude significant dispersion. Since the gypsum waste contains the bulk of the radium-226 originally present in the phosphate ore, the gypsum stack would also serve as a source of airborne radiation by direct emanation of radon gas produced by the decay of radium-226.

The processing and substantive review of the permit application is initiated by the preparation of a draft permit and explanatory fact sheet. 40 C.F.R. \u00a7\u00a7 124.6, 124.8 and 124.56. These documents are based upon the administrative record as defined in 40 C.F.R. \u00a7 124.9, including environmental review documents. <em>See </em>40 C.F.R. \u00a7 124.9(b)(6). Once the draft permit and support documents have been prepared, public notice of this action is given, initiating a 30-day period for receipt of public comment. 40 C.F.R. \u00a7 124.10(a)(l)(ii) and (b)(1). During this period, written comments may be submitted by \"any interested person\u201d, and a request for a discretionary public hearing may be filed. 40 C.F.R. \u00a7\u00a7 124.11 and 124.12. After the close of the comment period, the Regional Administrator bases his final permit decision on the administrative record defined at 40 C.F.R. \u00a7 124.18. That decision, accompanied by a response to comments received, is then issued. 40 C.F.R. \u00a7\u00a7 124.15(a) and 124.17. A notice of this decision, including information as to procedures for challenging the decision, is directed to \"the applicant and each person who has submitted written comments or requested notice of the final permit decision.\u201d 40 C.F.R. \u00a7 124.-15(a).</p>\n<p id=\"afr-dedup-1\">Review of the final permit decision is obtained by filing a request for an evidentiary hearing within thirty days after service of the decision. 40 C.F.R. \u00a7 124.74(a). The Regional Administrator must act upon the evidentiary hearing request within an additional 30 days. 40 C.F.R. \u00a7 124.75(a)(1). Any denial of the request may be appealed to the EPA Administrator; any such appeal to the EPA Administrator must be taken within 30 days, and is a prerequisite to review of the denial as a final agency action. 40 C.F.R. \u00a7 124.91(a)(1) and (e). Finally, once EPA has made its final decision as to whether to issue or deny an NPDES permit, \"any interested person\u201d may obtain judicial review of that decision by filing an application for such review \"in the Circuit Court of Appeals of the United States for the Federal judicial district in which such person resides____\u201d 33 U.S.C. \u00a7 1369(b)(1).</p>\n</footnote>\n<footnote label=\"7\">\n<p id=\"b768-8\">.

By contrast, the First, Second, Fourth and Seventh Circuits will reverse an agency\u2019s failure to prepare an EIS only if it is arbitrary and capricious. <em>See Grazing Fields Farm v.

As a practical matter, we note that the differences between the \"reasonableness\u201d and \"arbitrary and capricious\u201d standards of review are often difficult to discern <em>Cf.

We note that Manasota-88 did not pursue its administrative remedies following issuance of the modified NPDES permit in 1981. Because Gardinier proceeded with construction of its expanded plant facilities based on the EPA\u2019s approval of its entire plant modification scheme, the doctrine of laches could preclude the requirement that an EIS be prepared, even if NEPA were applicable. <em>See Save Our Wetlands, Inc. v.
