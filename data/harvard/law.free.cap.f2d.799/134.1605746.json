Johnson, </em>584 F.2d 148, 155 (6th Cir.1978), <em>cert. denied, </em>440 U.S. 918, 99 S.Ct. 1239, 59 L.Ed.2d 469 (1979) (quoting <em>United States v. Anderson, </em>562 F.2d 394, 398 (6th Cir.1977)); <em>see also United States v. Segal, </em>534 F.2d 578 (3rd Cir.1976) (citing <em>Ristaino v. Ross, </em>424 U.S. 589, 96 S.Ct. 1017, 47 L.Ed.2d 258 (1976)). Although the trial court has broad discre<page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"136\">*136</page-number>tion in the conduct of voir dire, an abuse with resulting reversible error will occur where the court\u2019s restriction hindered defendant\u2019s opportunity to make reasonable use of his challenges. <em>See United States v. Rucker, </em>557 F.2d 1046, 1049 (4th Cir.1977).<footnotemark>3</footnotemark></p>\n<p id=\"b214-4\">In <em>United States v. Baldwin, </em>607 F.2d 1295 (9th Cir.1979), the Ninth Circuit found reversible error where a district court refused to ask the venirepersons whether they were acquainted with the prospective witnesses. The <em>Baldwin </em>court held that \u201c \u2018[t]he defendant had a right to have the question answered to afford him an opportunity to exercise his ... challenges intelligently\u2019 \u201d. <em>Baldwin, </em>607 F.2d at 1297 (quoting <em>Cook v. United States, </em>379 F.2d 966, 971 (5th Cir.1967)). Similarly, other circuits have held that determining whether any of the prospective jurors know the witnesses is clearly important to the question of the jurors\u2019 impartiality. <em>See United States v. Anderson, </em>626 F.2d 1358 (8th Cir.1980), <em>cert. denied, </em>450 U.S. 912, 101 S.Ct. 1351, 67 L.Ed.2d 336 (1981); <em>United States v. Jackson, </em>508 F.2d 1001 (7th Cir.1975); <em>see also Cook v. United States, </em>379 F.2d 966 (5th Cir.1967). Indeed, this circuit previously stated that the better practice in voir dire is to permit the names of the witnesses to be read. <em>See United States v. Brown, </em>767 F.2d 1078, 1084 n. 2 (4th Cir.1985) <em>(Brown </em>7).<footnotemark>4</footnotemark> In light of that admonishment, the circumstances of this case, and the law of other circuits, we find that the trial court abused its discretion, resulting in reversible error, when it refused to ask the prospective jurors if they knew any of the witnesses.</p>\n<p id=\"b214-7\">The list of witnesses consisted of only fourteen names. Thus, very little time would have been required in asking and responding to the requested question. <em>See Baldwin, </em>607 F.2d at 1297-98 (\u201cThe few minutes which would be consumed by the asking of the question, the reading of the witness lists, and the answering of the question is outweighed by the importance of the question to the ... exercise of the ... challenge____\u201d) In addition, the facts herein necessitated that Brown obtain the desired information in order to determine whether the prospective jurors could render a fair and impartial judgment.<footnotemark>5</footnotemark></p>\n<p id=\"b214-10\">Nine of the fourteen witnesses were employees of the Navy. Three witnesses were law enforcement officers. At least five of the venirepersons were also naval employees and one was a law enforcement employee. This created the likelihood that the prospective jurors knew some of the witnesses. Furthermore, the jurors, having a common employment relationship with the witnesses, may have unduly given more credibility to those witnesses\u2019 testimonies. Cf<em>. Segal, </em>534 F.2d at 581. The inability to clarify these uncertainties prevented Brown from meaningfully and intelligently exercising his challenges. Accordingly, we find that the trial court erroneously limited the scope of voir dire so as to <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"137\">*137</page-number>preclude any reasonable assurance that bias and partiality would be discovered if present. We therefore remand the case for a new trial.</p>\n<p id=\"b215-4\">VACATED AND REMANDED.</p>\n<footnote label=\"1\">\n<p id=\"b213-12\">. Brown was charged with stealing government property in violation of 18 U.S.C. \u00a7\u00a7 641 and 2 at a naval base in Norfolk, Virginia. Other relevant facts are set forth in our earlier opinion at <em>United States v. Brown, </em>767 F.2d 1078 (4th Cir.1985). We see no reason to repeat those facts here.</p>\n</footnote>\n<footnote label=\"2\">\n<p id=\"b213-21\">. Brown argues that: (1) his double -jeopardy claims did not receive proper review; (2) the prospective jurors should have been asked at voir dire whether they knew any of the government witnesses; (3) the district court erred in admitting tape recordings and transcripts at trial, and allowing the jury to rehear and reread the materials; and (4) the district court improperly reinstructed the jury.</p>\n</footnote>\n<footnote label=\"3\">\n<p id=\"b214-5\">. Likewise, other circuits have held that the trial court abuses its discretion in voir dire when the parties are denied the right to some surface information about prospective jurors which might furnish a basis for challenge. <em>United States v. Baldwin, </em>607 F.2d 1295, 1297 (9th Cir.1979) (\u201cDiscretion is not properly exercised if the questions are not reasonably sufficient to test the jury for bias or partiality.\u201d); <em>United States v. Segal, </em>534 F.2d 578, 581 (3rd Cir.1976); <em>United States v. Jackson, </em>542 F.2d 403, 413 (7th Cir.1976). Such abuse results in reversible error since the number of meaningful challenges is reduced, and \"the inhibition of the right to challenge for cause or peremptorily is in that instance deemed to be prejudical\u201d to the defendant. <em>Baldwin, </em>607 F.2d at 1298 (citing <em>United States v. Dellinger, </em>472 F.2d 340, 366-77 (7th Cir.), <em>cert. denied, </em>410 U.S. 970, 93 S.Ct. 1443, 35 L.Ed.2d 706 (1972); <em>United States v. Rucker, </em>557 F.2d 1046, 1047-49 (4th Cir.1977)).</p>\n</footnote>\n<footnote label=\"4\">\n<p id=\"b214-12\">. We expressed doubt in <em>Brown I </em>that it was reversible error in that trial due to the extensive voir dire involved therein. The trial in issue here, however, did not involve a voir dire of comparable extensiveness. Accordingly, <em>Brown I </em>is distinguishable from the instant case.</p>\n</footnote>\n<footnote label=\"5\">\n<p id=\"b214-13\">. Indeed, under the current facts, without knowing the prospective witnesses' names, the venire-persons did not have sufficient knowledge to respond accurately to the question: Do you have any bias or prejudice which would prevent you from rendering a fair and impartial verdict? <em>See </em>discussion <em>supra.</em></p>\n</footnote>\n</opinion>\n</casebody>\n",
