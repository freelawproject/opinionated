Rochon was at all times during the pendency of this action incarcerated in the Louisiana State Penitentiary at Angola, Louisiana. Because of his incarceration, Rochon was dependent upon the United States Marshal\u2019s Service for service of process in this cause. Rochon asserts on appeal that his suit was improperly dismissed due to the fact that the Marshal\u2019s Service had failed to effectively serve Dr. Dawson with process. We reject Rochon\u2019s contentions and affirm the district court\u2019s dismissal.</p>\n<p id=\"b1180-11\">I. FACTS AND PROCEDURAL HISTORY</p>\n<p id=\"b1180-12\">Rochon was convicted of aggravated rape on December 7, 1979, and is currently serving a sentence of imprisonment at Angola State Penitentiary in Louisiana for that crime. Rochon filed suit against Dr. Mark Dawson on May 15,1985, pursuant to 42 U.S.C. \u00a7\u00a7 1981, 1983, and 1985, seeking to obtain documentary evidence to attack his rape conviction and to sue the prosecutor and the physician who treated the victim for conspiring against him. While styled as a civil rights suit, the district court recognized that Rochon\u2019s suit was in fact \u201can independent action against a person not a party for production of documents and things____\u201d Fed.R.Civ.P. 34(c).</p>\n<p id=\"b1180-14\">The district court granted leave to proceed in forma pauperis to Rochon, whereupon the U.S. Marshal\u2019s Service mailed a summons and complaint to Dr. Dawson at the location provided by Rochon \u2014 American Legion Hospital. The summons was marked \u201cmailed\u201d on June 11, 1985, but the Marshal\u2019s Service noted that as of August 28, 1985, no acknowledgement of receipt of process was received.</p>\n<p id=\"b1180-15\">On October 23, 1985, Rochon amended and supplemented his original complaint, adding American Legion Hospital as a defendant. American Legion was the hospital where Dr. Dawson apparently was employed. Pursuant to Rule 14 of the Local Rules of the Western District of Louisiana, Rochon\u2019s suit was ordered dismissed without prejudice on August 7, 1986. Rochon promptly filed an objection and notice of appeal to the dismissal order which was construed by the district court as a motion to reinstate his cause. The district court reinstated Rochon\u2019s suit noting that \u201cfor reasons unknown, defendant has never been properly served with plaintiff\u2019s amended pleading\u201d and ordering that service of Rochon\u2019s amended complaint be perfected upon the proper defendant by the clerk of the court. The clerk of the court then issued a summons and amended complaint, which were effectively served upon American Legion Hospital, but not Dr. <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"1109\">*1109</page-number>Dawson. In a subsequent order granting American Legion Hospital\u2019s motion for a more definite statement, the district court recited that \u201cthe record shows that Dr. Mark Dawson was never served with the complaint and that the American Legion Hospital was served on October 20, 1986.\u201d Despite this recitation, plaintiff took no further steps to properly serve Dr. Dawson.</p>\n<p id=\"b1181-4\">Eventually, the district court granted summary judgment for American Legion Hospital. Rochon does not appeal that ruling. However, on April 3, 1987, the clerk again dismissed the suit against Dr. Dawson pursuant to Local Rule 14 for failure to prosecute. Rochon filed a motion to reinstate which was denied by the district court. Thereafter, Rochon filed a notice of appeal.</p>\n<p id=\"b1181-5\">II. DISCUSSION</p>\n<p id=\"b1181-6\">Federal Rule of Civil Procedure 4(c)(2)(B)(i) provides that a party proceeding in forma pauperis is entitled to service by the U.S. Marshal.<footnotemark>1</footnotemark> In this case, since Rochon was proceeding in forma pauperis, he was dependent upon the Marshal\u2019s Service to effectively serve Dr. Dawson. Rule 4(c)(2)(C)(ii) permits service by mail, but dictates that personal service be utilized if no acknowledgement of service by mail is received within twenty days after the date of mailing. The initial issue presented before this Court is the extent to which a plaintiff proceeding in forma pauperis may rely upon the U.S. Marshal\u2019s Service to effect proper service of process on a defendant.</p>\n<p id=\"b1181-7\">Thus far, only the Second Circuit has addressed the above issue. <em>Romandette v. Weetabix, </em>807 F.2d 309 (2d Cir.1986). In <em>Romandette, </em>the defendant, while receiving actual notice of the plaintiff\u2019s suit, asserted the affirmative defense of improper service in accordance with state law. The district court rejected the defendant\u2019s affirmative defense of improper service reasoning that it would not be in the interest of justice to penalize the plaintiff for his reliance on the actions of the U.S. Marshal\u2019s Service, especially in light of the fact that the defendant was not prejudiced. After the case was reassigned to another district court, the defendant moved to dismiss on the grounds that personal service had never been effected. The district court, to which the case had now been reassigned, granted the defendant\u2019s motion.</p>\n<p id=\"b1181-14\">The Second Circuit held that the dismissal was an abuse of discretion, recognizing that the plaintiff had done everything he could to effect personal service through the Marshal\u2019s Service. The court held that:</p>\n<blockquote id=\"Azh\">As an incarcerated pro se litigant proceeding in forma pauperis, [the plaintiff] was entitled to rely upon service by the U.S. Marshals. He indicated to the court his reliance on service by the Marshals and he timely requested that the Marshals effect personal service.</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b1181-15\">... Moreover, the interests of justice, informed by a liberal interpretation of Rule 4, are best served by allowing this litigant to rely upon the personal service, albeit untimely, ultimately effected by the Marshal Service.</blockquote>\n<p id=\"b1181-16\"><em>Id. </em>at 311.</p>\n<p id=\"b1181-17\">In accord with the reasoning of the Second Circuit in <em>Romandette, </em>we hold <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"1110\">*1110</page-number>that a plaintiff proceeding in forma pauper-is is entitled to rely upon service by the U.S. Marshals and should not be penalized for failure of the Marshal\u2019s Service to properly effect service of process, where such failure is through no fault of the litigant. Thus, the inquiry in the instant case now becomes whether the failure of the Marshal\u2019s Service to properly serve Dr. Dawson was due to any dilatoriness or fault on the part of Rochon.</p>\n<p id=\"b1182-4\">Rochon initially listed American Legion Hospital as the address where Dr. Dawson could be served. Rochon also indicated that Dr. Dawson may have been the coroner in Acadia Parish, Louisiana. The Marshal\u2019s Service sent process by mail to Dr. Dawson at American Legion Hospital, but no acknowledgment was received. When the district court reinstated Rochon\u2019s cause of action after it had been dismissed for failure to prosecute for the first time, the court directed that service be perfected upon the proper defendant by the clerk of the court. A copy of the order was sent to Rochon on October 7, 1986. In attempted compliance with that order, the clerk directed service to American Legion Hospital by mail. Thereafter, Rochon directed his correspondence in the cause toward American Legion Hospital and not Dr. Dawson.</p>\n<p id=\"b1182-5\">In a subsequent order by the district court granting a motion by American Legion Hospital for a more definite statement, the court noted that \u201cthe record shows that Dr. Mark Dawson was never served with the complaint and that the American Legion Hospital was served on October 20, 1986.\u201d A copy of the above order was filed on January 9, 1987, and sent to Rochon on January 12, 1987, approximately twenty months after the original complaint was filed against Dr. Dawson by Rochon. Despite this notation in the district court\u2019s order, Rochon did not request that the Marshal\u2019s Service properly serve, either by mail or personal service, the appropriate defendant, Dr. Dawson. Thereafter, a summary judgment was granted by the district court in favor of American Legion Hospital. Subsequent to that ruling, the clerk of the court dismissed Rochon\u2019s claim against Dr. Dawson pursuant to Local Rule 14. The clerk\u2019s order of dismissal was filed April 3, 1987.</p>\n<p id=\"b1182-7\">While Rochon and other incarcerated plaintiffs proceeding in forma pauperis may rely on service by the U.S. Marshals, a plaintiff may not remain silent and do nothing to effectuate such service. At a minimum, a plaintiff should request service upon the appropriate defendant and attempt to remedy any apparent service defects of which a plaintiff has knowledge.</p>\n<p id=\"b1182-8\">In this case, Rochon was aware that Dr. Dawson had not been served as of August 21, 1986, as evidenced by Rochon\u2019s first motion to reinstate after dismissal of his suit, apparently for failure to timely effect service. Despite this knowledge, Rochon failed to request service on Dr. Dawson after the district court\u2019s admonition on January 9, 1987, that the proper defendant, Dr. Dawson, had not yet been served. As a result, when Rochon\u2019s claim was dismissed for failure to prosecute, he was not being penalized for the failure of the U.S. Marshals and the clerk of the court to effect service on Dr. Dawson, but instead because of inaction and dilatoriness on his part. Therefore, we are constrained to conclude that the clerk of the court properly dismissed Rochon\u2019s claim.</p>\n<p id=\"b1182-9\">Because we find that Rochon\u2019s claim was properly dismissed at the district court level, we do not find that the facts and circumstances of this case warrant the appointment of counsel. Accordingly, plaintiff\u2019s motion for counsel at the appellate level is DENIED. The dismissal of Rochon\u2019s claim is</p>\n<p id=\"b1182-10\">AFFIRMED.</p>\n<footnote label=\"1\">\n<p id=\"b1181-8\">.
