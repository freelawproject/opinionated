RUBIN, Circuit Judge:</author>\n<p id=\"b389-11\">The district court denied a request under the Equal Access to Justice Act by a successful Social Security benefits applicant for attorney\u2019s fees on the ground that the Secretary\u2019s position in denying benefits, while erroneous, was substantially justified. The issue is close, and we could not fault the district court had it awarded the fees sought. Our standard of review for such decisions, however, is abuse of discretion, and we can find no such egregious fault in the decision. We therefore affirm.</p>\n<p id=\"b389-12\">I.</p>\n<p id=\"b389-13\">Harold Broussard had received disability benefits since 1971 because of mental disorders. In 1980, the Secretary terminated his benefits. Broussard protested, and in 1983 an Administrative Law Judge held a hearing on his complaint. The Administrative Law Judge found that Broussard was capable of performing some type of work that would not require regular and intimate contact with the general public or subject him to stressful conditions. In 1984, on Broussard\u2019s appeal to the United States District Court, the district judge found that the AU\u2019s decision was not supported by substantial evidence and must be remanded for further proceedings.</p>\n<p id=\"b389-18\">Subsequent to the decision of the district court, Congress enacted the Social Security Disability Benefits Reform Act of 1984,<footnotemark>1</footnotemark> pursuant to which the Secretary adopted new regulations. With certain exceptions, these regulations require the Secretary to determine, before terminating benefits, that there has been a decrease in the medical severity of the recipient\u2019s condition.<footnotemark>2</footnotemark> Such a determination must be based on improvement in symptoms, medical signs, or laboratory findings.<footnotemark>3</footnotemark> The Secretary\u2019s conclusion on remand, that Broussard\u2019s disability had not ceased, was reached after the adoption of these regulations.</p>\n<p id=\"b389-19\">II.</p>\n<p id=\"b389-20\">After the district court remanded the case for further proceedings, Broussard filed an application with the district court for attorney\u2019s fees pursuant to the Equal Access to Justice Act (\u201cEAJA\u201d).<footnotemark>4</footnotemark> According to the EAJA, the court must award attorney\u2019s fees to a successful Social Security benefits claimant unless the Secretary proves that its position was \u201csubstantially justified.\u201d<footnotemark>5</footnotemark> Broussard contends that the Secretary was not substantially justified in defending this case because the Secretary lacked a reasonable basis for arguing that Broussard was no longer disabled.</p>\n<p id=\"b389-21\">A detailed review of the evidence before the ALJ is unnecessary. The district court correctly held the evidence not substantial enough to sustain the result. Whether the evidence was substantial enough to sustain the ALJ\u2019s determination, however, is a different inference from whether the Secretary\u2019s position was substantially justified.</p>\n<p id=\"b389-22\">The substantial-evidence standard and the without-reasonable-justification standard are neither semantic nor legal equivalents. Support by substantial evidence im<page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"312\">*312</page-number>plies a stronger basis than exacted by a decision with reasonable justification. In <em>Federal Election Commission v. Rose</em><footnotemark><em>6</em></footnotemark><em> </em>the D.C. Circuit observed:</p>\n<blockquote id=\"b390-4\">Thus, at the EAJA stage, the court is not wedded to the underlying judgment on the merits in assessing either the Government\u2019s litigation position or its underlying conduct. To the contrary, Congress\u2019 inclusion of the discrete legal standard makes clear that an independent evaluation through an EAJA perspective is required____ Only through a fresh look occasioned by application of the \u201csubstantially justified\u201d standard can the court honor Congress\u2019 intent, manifest in the inclusion of this standard, not to permit a prevailing party automatically to recover fees.</blockquote>\n<p id=\"b390-6\">The \u201csubstantial evidence\u201d standard, used to consider the merits of the agency decision, has been defined by the Supreme Court as \u201cmore than a mere scintilla,\u201d and \u201csuch relevant evidence as a reasonable mind might accept as adequate to support a conclusion.\u201d<footnotemark>7</footnotemark> On the other hand, the \u201csubstantial justification\u201d standard, used to determine whether the government was justified in continuing to defend its position in court, requires only that there be a reasonable basis in law and in fact for the position taken. As this Court noted in <em>Herron v. Bowen,</em><footnotemark><em>8</em></footnotemark><em> </em>the government\u2019s mere loss of the case gives rise to no presumption that the government\u2019s position was not substantially justified, and a finding of no substantial evidence does not mandate an award of EAJA fees or complete the court\u2019s inquiry.</p>\n<p id=\"b390-7\">The determination whether the government\u2019s position was substantially justified involves both legal and factual aspects. If the government can show that its position has a reasonable basis both in law and in fact, fees should be denied.<footnotemark>9</footnotemark> We may, however, reverse a district court order denying fees under the EAJA only if we find that the district court abused its discretion when it decided that the government\u2019s position had a reasonable basis.<footnotemark>10</footnotemark> Thus, in determining whether a lower court abused its discretion, we may, pursuant to Fed.R. Civ.P. 52(a), overturn findings of fact only if \u201cclearly erroneous,\u201d while we may review conclusions of law <em>de novo.</em><footnotemark><em>11</em></footnotemark></p>\n<p id=\"b390-13\">Broussard asserts that, when the district court remanded the case to the Secretary for further proceedings, the district judge found the position of the Secretary to be \u201cunreasonable\u201d and not supported by substantial evidence. The district court opinion, however, does not state that the position of the government was \u201cunreasonable,\u201d but only that there was not substantial evidence to support the decision.</p>\n<p id=\"b390-14\">The district court\u2019s review of the facts was not clearly erroneous.<footnotemark>12</footnotemark> The principles of law it applied were correct, and its final decision was well within the limits of judicial discretion.</p>\n<p id=\"b390-15\">In <em>Buckley v. Heckler,</em><footnotemark><em>13</em></footnotemark><em> </em>the Fifth Circuit held that in termination-of-benefits cases the Secretary is required to specifically demonstrate medical improvement. Although the <em>Buckley </em>opinion had not yet been rendered when the district court decided this case, the district court imposed a similar requirement. The court stated:</p>\n<blockquote id=\"b390-16\">It is clear that the Secretary may terminate disability benefits whenever she obtains evidence that a claimant\u2019s disability has ceased. However, ... \u201conce evidence has been presented which supports a finding that a condition exists, it is presumed, in the absence of proof to the contrary, that the condition has remained unchanged.\u201d</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b391-4\"><page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"313\">*313</page-number>... [W]e must ascertain whether the Secretary\u2019s finding of improvement to the point of no disability is supported by substantial evidence____</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b391-5\">;.. [T]his Court is unable to justify a finding that Mr. Broussard\u2019s disabling condition has <em>improved </em>since he was initially awarded disability benefits.<footnotemark>14</footnotemark></blockquote>\n<p id=\"Acz\">Even measured against this standard, we find no clear error in the district court\u2019s determination that there was a reasonable basis in fact for the Secretary\u2019s position. The evidence presented before the Administrative Law Judge showed that Broussard had not seen a mental health doctor in seven years, had not seen his personal physician for long periods of time, and was taking medication to allay his symptoms only sporadically. Two consultative examinations had been performed, both of which showed that he was well-oriented and had an adequate memory. The examining psychiatrist found him to have a moderately severe personality disorder, but felt that he was capable of handling his own affairs. Although it is clear that Broussard did not enjoy perfect mental health, the district court did not commit clear error in finding the Secretary\u2019s position to be reasonable.</p>\n<p id=\"b391-6\">Because the Secretary\u2019s' argument that there was an improvement in Broussard\u2019s condition had a reasonable basis in fact, we need not address the Secretary\u2019s alternative argument \u2014 raised on appeal but not in the record of proceedings before the district court \u2014 that a finding of medical improvement was unnecessary before the Fifth Circuit rendered the <em>Buckley </em>decision.</p>\n<p id=\"b391-7\">At the time the Secretary terminated Broussard\u2019s benefits, the legal requirements for vocational expert testimony in cases like Broussard\u2019s \u2014 where the claimant has solely nonexertional impairments \u2014 was unclear.<footnotemark>15</footnotemark> Indeed, in remanding this case, the district court suggested that a vocational expert be called. In doing so he stated,</p>\n<blockquote id=\"AcS\">The Fifth Circuit Court of Appeals, in the case of <em>Salinas v. Schweiker, </em>662 F.2d 345 (1981)[,] did not rule out utilization of vocational experts testimony. In <em>Salinas </em>the Court only held that the use of vocational experts to determine the existence of jobs is not mandatory.<footnotemark>16</footnotemark></blockquote>\n<p id=\"b391-12\">The Secretary\u2019s belief that such testimony was not mandatory was therefore not unreasonable.</p>\n<p id=\"b391-13\">In referring to the medical-vocational guidelines, the Secretary\u2019s regulations state:</p>\n<blockquote id=\"b391-14\">Since the rules are predicated on an individual\u2019s having an impairment which manifests itself by limitations in meeting the strength requirements of jobs, they may not be fully applicable where the nature of an individual\u2019s impairment does not result in such limitations, e.g., certain mental, sensory, or skin impairments ____</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b391-15\">(1) In the evaluation of disability where the individual has solely a nonexertional type of impairment, determination as to whether disability exists shall be based on the principles in the appropriate sections of the regulations, giving consideration to the rules for specific case situations in this Appendix 2. The rules do not direct factual conclusions of disabled or not disabled for individuals with solely nonexertional types of impairments.<footnotemark>17</footnotemark></blockquote>\n<p id=\"b391-16\">Recent case law has emphasized that, when the claimant has a solely nonexertional impairment, use of the medical-vocational guidelines in reaching a decision is improper.<footnotemark>18</footnotemark> However, it was not until after <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"314\">*314</page-number>this case was remanded that this court clearly and specifically required vocational expert testimony or similar evidence in such cases.<footnotemark>19</footnotemark></p>\n<p id=\"b392-4\">While we have summarized the support for the government\u2019s position, we are aware of the fact that Broussard prevailed and should have prevailed, and that the Secretary\u2019s original position was hardly objective. Nonetheless, the question of substantial justification is essentially for the district court and we do not substitute our view.</p>\n<p id=\"b392-5\">For these reasons, the judgment is AFFIRMED.</p>\n<footnote label=\"1\">\n<p id=\"b389-14\">.
