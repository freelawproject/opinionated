The plaintiff elected to receive back the leases which had been commandeered. During the period the commandeer order was in effect the possession of the plaintiff was not disturbed and no losses incurred anticipating removal. The defendant never entered into physical possession and the plaintiff remained in possession under its original leases many months after the leases had been returned to it. There is no value proved for the temporary taking during the life of the commandeer order, and, doubtless, no value can be proved for such an insignificant temporary disturbance of physical possession. This case is materially different from the case of <em>William </em>Wrigley, Jr., <em>Co. </em>v. <em>The United </em>States, 75 C. Cls. 569. and that case has no application. The plaintiff is suing for just compensation for the taking of its leases and must prove the value of the thing taken. This it has failed to do.</p>\n<p id=\"b487-5\"><page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"461\">*461</page-number>This cause of action is for the taking of private property for public use and is within the general jurisdiction of this \u25a0court. <em>Barnes </em>v. <em>United </em>States, 46 C.
