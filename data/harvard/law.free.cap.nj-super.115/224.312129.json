A. D.</author>\n<p id=\"AWa\">This is a consolidated dependency action under the Workmen\u2019s Compensation Act, <em>N. J. S. A. </em>34:15-7 <em>et seq., </em>brought by the widow and mother of John Wesley Sturdivant who on February 20, 1967 suffered a fatal heart attack while working at respondent\u2019s plant.</p>\n<p id=\"b243-12\">The judge of compensation, and the County Court on appeal, determined that decedent\u2019s death resulted from a compensable accident which arose out of and during the course of his employment. On July 17, 1970 a judgment was en<page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"226\">*226</page-number>tered in favor of both petitioners awarding compensation benefits to them, the amounts of which are not in dispute.</p>\n<p id=\"b244-4\">Prior to the formal entry of judgment on July 17, 1970 respondent\u2019s counsel wrote to petitioner\u2019s counsel on June 16, 1970 as follows:</p>\n<blockquote id=\"b244-5\">We are in receipt of Judge DiBuono\u2019s opinion affirming the judgment of the Division of Workmen\u2019s Compensation in the above captioned matter.</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b244-6\">Please forward an Order for Judgment for our consent. Upon the signing and filing of same, you may forward us warrants to satisfy judgment and we will see that the same are paid.</blockquote>\n<p id=\"b244-7\">In due course warrants for satisfaction of the July 17, 1970 judgment were mailed to respondent\u2019s counsel, who filed them with the Union County Clerk by July 27, 1970. Presumably, respondent\u2019s insurance carrier had mailed cheeks to respondent\u2019s counsel in full payment of the judgments for delivery to counsel for petitioners. However, before the checks were delivered to counsel for petitioners, a synopsis of the opinion in <em>Walck v. Johns-Manville Products Corp., </em>56 <em>N. J. </em>533 (1970) appeared in the August 20, 1970 issue of the <em>New Jersey Lem Journal </em>(93 <em>N. J. L. J. </em>603). On August 25, 1970 respondent\u2019s counsel wrote petitioners\u2019 counsel that in their opinion <em>Walck </em>represented a change in the decisional law in heart cases, and they intended to appeal. A notice of appeal was filed the following day August 26, 1970.</p>\n<p id=\"b244-8\">On September 14, 1970 respondent moved before Judge DiBuono to get back the warrants for satisfaction of judgment previously filed. The; basis of the motion was that the warrants were \u201c\u2018inadvertently filed.\u201d The motion was granted on September 25, 1970. While the record contains only a notice of cross-appeal by the decedent\u2019s widow of the September 25, 1970 order, we will proceed on the basis that both petitioners have cross-appealed.</p>\n<p id=\"b244-9\">We have recited the foregoing undisputed procedural history because we have determined that the County Court was without jurisdiction to make the September 25, 1970 order, <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"227\">*227</page-number>and that the judgments should be paid. In so doing, we do not reach the merits of the appeal.</p>\n<p id=\"b245-5\">When respondent filed its notice of appeal, the County Court lost jurisdiction in the matter since the supervision and control of the proceedings on appeal rested with the Appellate Division. <em>B. </em>2:9-1 (a). However, we prefer to treat with the merits of the application for a return of the warrants for satisfaction of judgment as though made directly to us.</p>\n<p id=\"b245-6\">The procedure used in this case to finalize the County Court\u2019s judgment affirming the compensation awards is in common daily usage throughout the State. The legal effect of what transpires is that a contract is entered into between the parties, to terminate the litigation. In actual practice, respondent\u2019s counsel and the insurance carrier have reviewed the county judge\u2019s decision and have decided not to appeal but to pay the judgment. Petitioner\u2019s counsel is requested to submit a warrant for satisfaction of judgment, and respondent\u2019s counsel expressly, or impliedly, agrees to pay the judgment before filing the warrant for satisfaction. Petitioner\u2019s counsel, before preparing and sending the warrant for satisfaction, has presumably consulted with his client and they have determined not to appeal from the award made to petitioner or the allowances to counsel. In short, the parties have recognized the validity of the judgment and have voluntarily entered into a contract to waive or surrender their respective right to appeal. While no- New Jersey ease in point has been brought to our attention \u2014 nor have we found any \u2014 we are in accord with the, views expressed in 4 <em>Am. Jur. </em>2d, <em>Appeal and Error, </em>\u00a7242 at 737:</p>\n<blockquote id=\"b245-7\">It has been broadly asserted that any act on the part of a party by which he impliedly recognizes the validity of a judgment against him operates as a waiver of his right to appeal therefrom, or to bring error to reverse it, and clearly one who voluntarily acquiesces in or ratifies a judgment against him cannot appeal from it. The acquiescence which prohibits an appeal, or destroys it when taken, is the doing or giving of the tiling which the decree commands to be done or given.</blockquote>\n<p id=\"b246-3\"><page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"228\">*228</page-number>See also Annotation, \u201cAppeal - Payment of Judgment-Effect,\u201d 39 <em>A. L. R. </em>2d 153 (1955), wherein conflicting views are set forth, depending upon individual fact patterns.</p>\n<p id=\"b246-4\">Courts look with favor upon contracts which terminate litigation. See <em>Bauer v. Griffin, </em>104 <em>N. J. Super. </em>530, 545 (Law Div. 1969), aff\u2019d 108 <em>N. J. Super. </em>414 (App. Div. 1970), certif. den. 56 <em>N. J. </em>245 (1970); <em>Jannarone v. </em>W. <em>T. </em>Co., 65 <em>N. J. Super. </em>472, 476 (App. Div. 1961), certif. den. 35 <em>N. J. </em>61 (1961). When counsel requested and received the warrants for satisfaction, and thereafter filed them, his client was legally obligated to pay the judgment. On the facts in this case, to argue they were inadvertently filed is specious. No reasons are advanced by respondent, legal or equitable, which justify exercising our discretion to nullify the contract terminating this litigation.</p>\n<p id=\"b246-5\">By what we have said it is not to be interpreted that we agree with respondent\u2019s contention that <em>W alele </em>changed the existing law in heart cases, or that we disagree with the conclusions reached by the judge of compensation or Judge DiBuono on the compensability of the heart attack.</p>\n<p id=\"b246-6\">The order of September 25, 1970 is reversed and respondent\u2019s appeal is dismissed.</p>\n</opinion>\n</casebody>\n",
