The jury recommended life imprisonment on each conviction, and King was sentenced to terms of life imprisonment on each, to he served consecutively.</p>\n<p id=\"b160-6\"># sji <em>% </em>jj: ij\u00ed <em>% </em># <em>%</em></p>\n<p id=\"b160-7\">[Here the court discusses the testimony of various witnesses to the case]</p>\n<p id=\"b160-8\">The most important State witness was Beverly Peters, a/k/a Vevlyn Jackson. Between 11 p.m. and midnight on the night of the murders, Miss Peters was standing on the corner outside Sid\u2019s Bar. After about 20 minutes, she saw two white men emerge from Skopa\u2019s Bar across the street. As the men were crossing the street to the corner diagonally opposite the corner on which Miss Peters stood, she saw Glover [a companion of the defendants] and defendants King, Clark and Allen emerge from Skopa\u2019s Bar. The four ran up to the two white men, and King stuck his gun up at the older man\u2019s (Beismann\u2019s) head. The younger man (Mueller), upon seeing this, fled down Brunswick Avenue towards Sanford Street. King thereupon took his gun from Beismann\u2019s head, and ran after Mueller; he shot at the fleeing Mueller, apparently twice, and Miss Peters saw Mueller fall down in the street. At this, Clark, Allen, and Glover ran into Sid\u2019s Bar, while King took Beismann down Old Rose Street. Miss Peters did not see what King did with Beismann, because she also went into Sid\u2019s Bar at that point. Miss Peters\u2019 boyfriend, Curtis Jackson, the father of her son, was in Sid\u2019s Bar at the time. <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"143\">*143</page-number>Miss Peters told Jackson about what she had seen, and Jackson suggested that they leave because Jackson had been in trouble with the law, as had Miss Peters, and he was afraid that she would be called as a witness in this matter. Jackson and Miss Peters left Sid\u2019s Bax and went home together.</p>\n<p id=\"b161-5\">3; $ 4? 3*</p>\n<p id=\"b161-6\">[Here the court discusses additional testimony of witnesses in the case.]</p>\n<p id=\"b161-7\">The principal ground of appeal is the contention that the court erred in allowing the State at the conclusion of its case, over strenuous defense objection, to adduce in evidence Miss Peters\u2019 testimony given before the Grand Jury on April 29, 1969 and a statement she gave the police March 14, 1969 which in substance were to the same effect as her testimony to the trial. (The case was tried from November 5 through November 13, 1969). In so doing, the trial judge accepted the State\u2019s contention that it was entitled to bolster Miss Peters\u2019 credibility because her cross-examination was designed to suggest to the jury that her testimony was a recent fabrication. See <em>Evidence Rule </em>20 which states: * * No evidence to support the credibility of a witness shall be admitted except to meet a charge of recent fabrication of testimony.\u201d</p>\n<p id=\"b161-9\">Prior to the promulgation of the evidence rules in 1967 this State allowed somewhat broader latitude in supporting by prior consistent statements the credibility of a witness assailed on cross-examination.</p>\n<blockquote id=\"b161-10\">\u201cIt is well established that previous statements of a witness are ordinarily not admissible to strengthen and corroborate his testimony, but the general rule is that when a witness has been impeached by an attack upon Ms credibility, tending to show that bis testimony is a fabrication of recent date or is colored, distorted, and falsified through the influence of some strong personal motive, his statements made on occasions so near to the event involved, and so long anterior to the litigation that the effect of his speech could not have been foreseen, are admissible.\u201d</blockquote>\n<p id=\"b161-11\"><em>State v. </em>Neiman, 123 <em>N. J. L. </em>341, 344 (Sup. Ct. 1939), aff\u2019d o. b. 124 <em>N. </em>J. <em>L. </em>562 (E. &amp; A. 1940).</p>\n<p id=\"b162-3\"><page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"144\">*144</page-number>See also <em>State v. Kane, </em>9 <em>N. J. Super. </em>254, 262-264 (App. Div. 1950).</p>\n<p id=\"b162-4\">The version of <em>Bule </em>20 first adopted by the Supreme Court (September 14, 1964) but which never became effective, read, in pertinent part:</p>\n<blockquote id=\"b162-5\">\u201c* *\u25a0 * evidence to support the credibility of a witness shall be admitted except to meet a charge of willful falsification of testimony.\u201d</blockquote>\n<p id=\"b162-6\">The change to the now-existing version was accomplished at a conference of the Legislative Commission serving pursuant to SCR 28 (1966) and SCR 1 (1967) with the Supreme Court. See Report of the Rules of Evidence Study Commission (1967) p. 7.</p>\n<p id=\"b162-7\">The express limitation in <em>Evidence Bule </em>20 to charges of \"recent fabrication\u201d should, in the light of the prior history of the rule and the evolution of <em>Rule </em>20 as it now stands, ordinarily call for adherence to that formulation as the only criterion for admissibility of prior consistent statements of the witness assailed to support credibility. However, we find that the cross-examination of the witness Peters by the several defense counsel here was such as to permit the trial court properly to determine that it met the criterion of charge of recent fabrication.</p>\n<p id=\"b162-8\">In ruling in favor of admission of the evidence the trial court relied largely upon the following portions of the cross-examinations of Miss Peters:</p>\n<blockquote id=\"b162-9\">\u201cQ. <em>Isn\u2019t it </em>true you made up this story to help protect [your boyfriend] Curtis?</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b162-10\">A.

No. I had already made my statement. I said I was going to lie in Court and change my statement.\u201d (Emphasis by court.)</blockquote>\n<p id=\"b164-21\">A \u201ccharge\u201d of recent fabrication can be effected through implication by the cross-examiner as well as by direct accusation of the witness. In fact that is the usual way in which the charge is made. See <em>State v. Kane, supra </em>(9 <em>N. J. Super., </em>at 263-265). Defendant argues that the cross-examination did not bring out any <em>recent </em>fabrication by Miss Peters but only suggested that her testimonial version of the affair was a lie from the time of the very first statement of the witness to the police and that it was contrived by her to protect Jackson. We think the trend of the cross-examinations, especially toward their conclusion, went considerably beyond that. The allusion to the threat by the witness to the detectives a week before trial that she intended to lie at the trial, coupled closely with the outright assertion of the examiner that she was in fact lying in implicating King, could fairly have been held by the trial judge to have conveyed the impression to the jury that the witness had recently decided to lie to involve King. Eor present purposes, it is the <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"147\">*147</page-number>impression the cross-examiner makes upon the jury in the heat of the trial rather than what an appellate court would discern from a coldly analytical study of the testimony which must control review of the somewhat discretionary exercise of judgment made by the trial judge in the matter. We find no error.</p>\n<p id=\"b165-5\">Beyond the foregoing, a finding of prejudice would be dubious even were the admission of the evidence technically erroneous. The cross-examination was fairly rife with implications that Miss Peters had given statements to the police inculpating King.</p>\n<p id=\"b165-6\">Moreover, the other unexceptionable evidence adduced by the State, direct and circumstantial, of King\u2019s guilt was overwhelming.</p>\n<p id=\"b165-7\">[The court here considers and rejects other grounds of' appeal.]</p>\n<p id=\"b165-8\">Judgment affirmed.</p>\n</opinion>\n</casebody>\n",
