J. A. D.</author>\n<p id=\"Abq\">Petitioner, a nontenure teacher, had been employed by respondent North Wildwood Board of Education under a contract which expired on June 30, 1969. About January 2, 1969 she was advised by the superintendent of schools of the district that he would not recommend a renewal of her teaching contract for the 1969-1970 term. A renewal contract would-have conferred tenure upon petitioner. The superintendent\u2019s recommendation not to renew petitioner\u2019s contract was accepted by the local board of education; petitioner\u2019s contract was not renewed.</p>\n<p id=\"b248-6\">Petitioner filed her petition to review the local board\u2019s action with the State Commissioner of Education. On August 21, 1969 the Commissioner dismissed the petition upon the ground that it failed to state a claim upon which relief could be granted. Thereafter, on appeal to the State Board of Education, the Commissioner\u2019s decision was affirmed. This appeal by petitioner from the final determination of the State Board of Education followed.</p>\n<p id=\"b248-7\">The question before us is whether a nontenure teacher whose contract is not renewed, thus precluding her from obtaining tenure under <em>N. J. S. A. </em>18A:28-1 <em>et seq., </em>has a constitutional right (a) to be furnished with a statement of reasons for the nonrenewal, and (b) to be heard before the board in regard to those reasons.</p>\n<p id=\"b248-8\"><em>Zimmerman v. Board of Education, Newark, </em>38 <em>N. J. </em>65 (1962), is dispositive of this issue. As stated therein:</p>\n<blockquote id=\"b248-9\">Except for statutory conditions, a teacher is retained solely on a contract basis during Ms probationary employment. At the expiration of an annual contract period, the employment relationsMp ceases to exist unless a new contract has been entered into. * * * And except to the extent of constitutional or statutory limitations, there is no <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"231\">*231</page-number>legal duty on the part o\u00ed a board to re-employ a teacher at the end of a contract term, [at 75].</blockquote>\n<p id=\"b249-5\"><em>Zimmerman </em>cites (at 70) the historical view expressed in cases snch as <em>People v. Chicago, </em>278 <em>Ill. </em>318, 116 <em>N. E. </em>158 (Sup. Ct. 1917) :</p>\n<blockquote id=\"b249-6\">No person has a right to demand that he or she shall be employed as a teacher. The board has the absolute right to decline to employ or to re-employ any applicant for any reason whatever or for no reason at all.</blockquote>\n<p id=\"b249-7\">This statement is subject in our State to the statutory right of tenure. It is also subject to the constitutional guarantee against discrimination. No such claim has been made in this case.</p>\n<p id=\"b249-8\">Unless and until our Legislature or Supreme Court adopts a different public policy, we feel bound by <em>Zimmerman, supra, </em>and the long standing interpretation of our Education Laws by the State Department of Education to conclude that nontenure teachers have no legal right to a renewal of a teaching contract, or to a statement or explanation of the reasons for nonrenewal, or to a hearing as to the reasonableness of reasons for nonrenewal, absent a showing of unconstitutional discrimination.</p>\n<p id=\"b249-9\">The decision of the State Board of Education is affirmed.</p>\n</opinion>\n</casebody>\n",
