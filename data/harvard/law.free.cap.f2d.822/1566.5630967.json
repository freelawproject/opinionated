Auto-Ordnance appeals from an order of the United States Claims Court, which granted the defendant\u2019s motion for summary judgment and dismissed its complaint.</p>\n<p id=\"b942-11\">The questions presented on this appeal are whether the Claims Court erred in finding that the adjustable rear sights and front sight and compensator units, manufactured and sold with the Auto-Ordnance carbines, were component parts of a complete firearm and subject to the excise tax imposed by 26 U.S.C. \u00a7 4181, or whether the sights and compensators were tax-exempt \u201caccessories\u201d of firearms. This is a question of first impression for this Court.</p>\n<p id=\"b942-12\">Since we hold that the adjustable rear sights and front sight and compensator units are \u201caccessories,\u201d they are exempt from the tax imposed on their \u201cadded value\u201d pursuant to 26 C.F.R. \u00a7 48.4181-l(a)(2) (1986). Accordingly, the judgment of the Claims Court is reversed.</p>\n<p id=\"b942-13\">The Auto-Ordnance carbines were sold with two types of rear sights: (1) a plain, nonadjustable rear sight, and (2) a deluxe, adjustable rear sight. The carbines were also offered for sale with or without a front sight and compensator unit. In essence, Auto-Ordnance maintains that the applicable statute, 26 U.S.C. \u00a7 4181, and the pertinent treasury regulation, 26 C.F.R. \u00a7 48.4181-1, impose a manufacturer\u2019s excise tax on firearms, but specifically exempt \u201caccessories of firearms.\u201d 26 C.F.R. \u00a7 48.4181-l(a)(2). Auto-Ordnance contends that the sights and compensators are clearly accessories because the articles or units are readily removable, merely enhance the utility or appearance of the gun, and are not required to enable the carbine to fire a bullet.</p>\n<p id=\"b942-14\">The defendant maintains that the adjustable rear sights, and the front sight and compensator units, are component parts of the carbines, and, therefore, are subject to the excise tax imposed pursuant to 26 U.S.C. \u00a7 4181 and 26 C.F.R. \u00a7 48.4181-1. The defendant asserts that the items are component parts of the firearm because the deluxe carbine, with the adjustable rear sight and front-sight compensator unit attached, was marketed and sold as a \u201cdiscrete\u201d model. Also, defendant reasons that the items in this case \u201cserve a major, and not a secondary, purpose in that they enable the \u2018Deluxe Model\u2019 carbine to resemble more closely the original Thompson gun.\u201d Moreover, defendant contends that the Treasury Regulations do not state that the component parts of a firearm are limited to those parts that are necessary to fire a bullet.</p>\n<p id=\"b943-3\"><page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"1568\">*1568</page-number>Background</p>\n<p id=\"b943-4\">The parties submitted the case to the United States Claims Court on the following stipulated facts. Auto-Ordnance manufactured and sold two models of semi-automatic carbines. These carbines, one a \u201cstandard\u201d model and the other a \u201cdeluxe\u201d model, were patterned after the Thompson submachine gun. The models were offered for sale with two types of rear sights: a plain, nonadjustable sight, and a Lyman-type adjustable sight. The carbines are designed to accept either the standard rear sight or the adjustable rear sight, and, in about 5 minutes, using standard tools, each can be exchanged for the other.</p>\n<p id=\"b943-5\">The carbines were also offered for sale with a plain front sight, or a \u201cfront sight and compensator\u201d unit. The front sight and compensator of the deluxe model are two pieces specially designed to be fitted together. A compensator is a tube-like device which is screwed onto the muzzle. It contains holes to vent gases, and \u201ccould have an effect on muzzle rise\u201d or recoil of the firearm to which it is attached. There was no proof, however, that, other than appearance, the compensator sold by Auto-Ordnance had any actual effect on the carbines. Using standard tools, the standard front sight can be exchanged for the compensator unit in about 20 minutes.</p>\n<p id=\"b943-6\">It was also stipulated that the front sight enabled an average marksman to aim the carbine more accurately than without the front sight, and that the combination of the front and rear sight enabled an average marksman to aim more accurately than with no sight or one sight. The record does not indicate whether the adjustable rear sight would enable a person to aim more accurately than when using a plain rear sight. The carbines can be fired and used without any sights.</p>\n<p id=\"b943-7\">Auto-Ordnance paid an excise tax on the value of the standard version of the front and rear sights on all carbines that it sold from January 1, 1976 through December 31,1978. Upon reviewing Auto-Ordnance\u2019s tax returns, the Internal Revenue Service (IRS) assessed an additional tax in the amount of $44,038.58,<footnotemark>1</footnotemark> plus interest, on the \u201cadded value\u201d of the adjustable rear sights and the front sight and compensator units of the deluxe model carbines.</p>\n<p id=\"b943-11\">After paying this additional tax, Auto-Ordnance filed a claim for a refund with the IRS, contending that the sights and compensators were \u201caccessories\u201d to firearms. Plaintiff sought a refund for the tax imposed on the difference in value of the standard sights and the adjustable sights and compensators. Upon rejection of its claim by the IRS, Auto-Ordnance filed suit in the United States Claims Court.</p>\n<p id=\"b943-12\">In dismissing Auto-Ordnance\u2019s complaint, the Claims Court held that the \u201cstatutory language, the relevant Treasury Regulations, and the IRS administrative practice confirm that the sights of a portable weapon capable of discharging a bullet by means of an explosive are not excluded from the definition of a firearm.\u201d <em>Auto-Ordnance Corp. v. United States, </em>10 Cl.Ct. 281, 286 (1986). In interpreting treasury regulation 48.4181-1(a)(2), the Claims Court stated: \u201cItems which are component parts or accessories ... when included in a complete firearm, even when in a knockdown condition, are taxable.\u201d The Claims Court also concluded that the items \u201cwere necessary to promote the appearance that the carbine included copies of the components that made up the original Thompson submachine gun,\u201d and that \u201cthe Deluxe Model could not be a complete firearm without the items at issue.\u201d <em>Id. </em>at 286.</p>\n<p id=\"b943-13\">Discussion</p>\n<p id=\"b943-14\">Section 4181 of the Internal Revenue Code imposes a tax of 11 percent \u201cupon the sale by the manufacturer, producer, or importer\" of firearms, other than pistols and revolvers. 26 U.S.C. \u00a7 4181 (1982). The applicable treasury regulation defines firearms as \u201cany portable weapons, such as rifles, carbines, machine guns, shotguns, or fowling pieces, from which a shot, bullet, <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"1569\">*1569</page-number>or other projectile may be discharged by an explosive.\u201d 26 C.F.R. \u00a7 48.4181-2(c). Regulation 48.4181-1(a)(2), however, specifically exempts from taxation \u201cparts or accessories of firearms.\u201d Another regulation provides that \u201c[wjhere a taxable article and a nontaxable article are sold by the manufacturer as a unit, the tax attaches to that portion of the manufacturer\u2019s sale price of the unit which is properly allocable to the taxable article.\u201d <em>Id. </em>\u00a7 48.4216(a)-1(e).</p>\n<p id=\"b944-4\">The questions presented in this case pertain to the meaning of the term \u201caccessory\u201d as used in the regulations, and whether the \u201cdeluxe\u201d items of the Auto-Ordnance carbine are accessories under this definition. The parties agree that the question is one of \u201cclassification,\u201d that is, whether the articles are \u201caccessories\u201d or component parts of firearms. If the added items are accessories, the existing regulations exempt them from tax, even if the accessories are sold with a complete firearm. 26 C.F.R. \u00a7 48.4181-l(a)(2).</p>\n<p id=\"b944-5\">Regulation 48.4181-l(a)(2) provides:</p>\n<blockquote id=\"b944-6\">(2) <em>Parts or accessories. No tax is imposed by section 4181 on </em>the sale of parts or <em>accessories </em>of firearms, pistols, revolvers, shells, and cartridges when sold separately, or <em>when sold with a complete firearm. </em>Thus, <em>no tax attaches to </em>the sale of telescopic mounts, rubber recoil pads, <em>rifle sights, and similar parts for firearms </em>when sold separately, or <em>when sold with complete firearms for use as spare parts or accessories. </em>The tax does attach, however, to sale of complete firearms, pistols, revolvers, shells, and cartridges, or to sale of such articles which, although in a knockdown condition, are complete as to all component parts.</blockquote>\n<p id=\"b944-7\">26 C.F.R. \u00a7 48.4181-1(a)(2) (1986) (emphasis added).</p>\n<p id=\"b944-8\">The plain language of section 4181, and the first sentence of the regulation, would seem to resolve the questions presented. The statute imposes a tax on firearms, and the regulation expressly states that \u201c[n]o tax is imposed by section 4181 on the sale of parts or accessories of firearms ... when sold with a complete firearm.\u201d 26 C.F.R. \u00a7 48.4181-l(a)(2). It may be noted that the Claims Court was in error when it stated that \u201c[ijtems which are component parts or accessories ... when included with a complete firearm ... are taxable.\u201d 10 Cl.Ct. 281, 286 (1986).</p>\n<p id=\"b944-10\">The Claims Court was in error because the pertinent regulations make clear that, if the added items are accessories, they are exempt from tax. The Claims Court was also in error when it determined that \u201cthe Deluxe Model could not be a complete firearm without the items in issue.\u201d This statement would seem to inject or introduce into the existing regulations a concept of \u201ccommercial completeness.\u201d The existing regulations, however, do not speak of \u201ccommercial completeness.\u201d Under the present regulations the question is whether the added items were component parts of a firearm or accessories to a firearm. For the defendant to maintain that the carbines are not complete firearms without the adjustable rear sights and front sight and compensator units is inaccurate because it is clear that they are added solely for the purpose of appearance. Hence, if accessories are added to a complete firearm, they are exempt from tax. The question, therefore, is whether the adjustable rear sights and front sight and compensator units are accessories.</p>\n<p id=\"b944-11\">The term \u201caccessory,\u201d however, is not defined in either the statute or the treasury regulations. Plaintiff urges that the term be interpreted and applied as it is commonly defined in standard lexicographic sources. Defendant makes no attempt to define the word \u201caccessory.\u201d</p>\n<p id=\"b944-12\">Since the regulations neither specify what are the component parts of a complete firearm, nor define the term \u201caccessory,\u201d it is appropriate for the Court to look beyond the language of the regulation in order to ascertain the meaning of the term \u201caccessories.\u201d <em>E.g., United States v. C.F. Liebert, </em>59 C.C.P.A. 43, 45 n. 5, 450 F.2d 1405, 1406 n. 5 (1971) (accessory defined by dictionary).</p>\n<p id=\"b944-13\">An accessory is commonly defined as \u201ca thing of secondary or subordinate impor-tance____ An object or device that is not <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"1570\">*1570</page-number>essential in itself but adds to the beauty, convenience or effectiveness of something else.\u201d <em>Webster\u2019s Third New International Dictionary </em>11 (1981). Another source defines accessory as \u201cequipment, usually demountable and replaceable,\u201d that is added \u201cfor convenience, comfort, safety or completeness.\u201d <em>Webster\u2019s New Universal Unabridged Dictionary </em>11 (2d ed. 1983).</p>\n<p id=\"b945-4\">Although not dispositive, the meaning or definition of the terms \u201cparts\u201d and \u201caccessories\u201d has been frequently litigated in tariff or customs classification cases. <em>See, e.g., United States v. C.F. Liebert, </em>59 C.C.P.A. 43, 450 F.2d 1405 (1971), <em>aff'g </em>63 Cust.Ct. 357, C.D. 3919, 305 F.Supp. 1400 (1969); <em>Gallagher &amp; Ascher Co. v. United States, </em>52 C.C.P.A. 11, C.A.D. 849 (1964); <em>Olympus Corp. v. United States, </em>72 Cust.Ct. 176, C.D. 4538 (1974). In customs classification cases, for an article to be considered a \u201cpart,\u201d rather than an accessory, it must be an integral, constituent, or component part, without which the article to which it is to be joined could not function. <em>See, e.g., United States v. Willoughby Camera Stores, Inc., </em>21 C.C.P.A. 322, T.D. 46851 (1933) (tripods are not component parts of view cameras). \u201cThe mere fact that two articles are designed and constructed to be used together, does not necessarily make either a part of the other.\u201d <em>Id. </em>at 323.</p>\n<p id=\"b945-5\">It also has been held that a device may be a \u201cpart\u201d of an article even though its use is optional and the article will function without it, if the device is \u201cdedicated irrevocably for use\u201d with the article, and, once installed, the article cannot be used without it. <em>See Trans Atlantic Co. v. United States, </em>48 C.C.P.A. 30, 33, C.A.D. 758 (1960); <em>United States v. Pompeo, </em>43 C.C.P.A. 9, 14, C.A.D. 602 (1955). Certain devices or objects, however, despite their usefulness in conjunction with other articles, retain a separateness of identity and a functional self-sufficiency which precludes their classification as component parts. <em>See, e.g., Schick X-Ray Co. v. United States, </em>271 F.Supp. 305 (Cust.Ct.1967). More simply stated, \u201can element which is not essential to the operation of an article for its intended purpose is not part of an article.\u201d <em>United States v. Cody Manufacturing Co., </em>44 C.C.P.A. 67, 72, C.A.D. 639 (1957).</p>\n<p id=\"b945-8\">Plaintiff contends that the sights and compensators are not component parts of the carbine because they are not essential to its functioning as a firearm. It further contends that they are \u201caccessories\u201d to firearms because the items are readily demountable and replaceable, are added for comfort, convenience, or appearance, and are of secondary value. The defendant, however, maintains that the regulations do not state that component parts are only those necessary to fire a bullet, and that the \u201ccircumstances of the marketing and manufacture of the carbines clearly demonstrate that the Lyman sight and compensator/front unit are component parts of a complete firearm.\u201d</p>\n<p id=\"b945-9\">Whether Auto-Ordnance marketed or advertised the carbines as a \u201cdiscrete\u201d model with an adjustable rear sight, or a front sight and compensator unit, is not controlling under the existing regulations. Were the court to decide the question presented on the basis of Auto-Ordnance\u2019s advertising or marketing methods, in effect, it would be rewriting the regulations by including the notion of \u201ccommercial completeness.\u201d Nor can the court adopt an interpretation which would conflict with a fair reading of the existing regulations, which expressly exempt accessories from tax, even if they are sold with a complete firearm. <em>See </em>26 C.F.R. \u00a7 48.4181-l(a)(2).</p>\n<p id=\"b945-10\">The stipulated facts make clear that the items in question are of \u201csecondary or subordinate importance.\u201d For example, although the compensator\u2019s theoretical function is to reduce recoil by venting escaping gases, there is no proof that it actually performs this function. Its addition to the firearm is merely one of appearance, to have the carbine resemble the Thompson submachine gun. Both the adjustable rear sight and the compensator unit can be removed from the carbine for use without sights, or can be exchanged for standard sights. Furthermore, the carbine may be <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"1571\">*1571</page-number>fired whether or not the sights are attached.</p>\n<p id=\"b946-4\">The sights and compensators, when attached to the carbine, do not merge with, or become an integral, constituent, or component part of the carbine. Indeed, it is stipulated that they are readily removable with standard tools, and that the carbine will fire without the sights or compensator. Moreover, even if a sight is attached to the carbine, it does not have to be used by the marksman, since the carbine may be \u201cfired from the hip.\u201d</p>\n<p id=\"b946-5\">In this case, although the pertinent regulations do not specify what are the component parts of firearms, a regulation does define the meaning of firearms. Regulation 48.4181-2(c) defines the term firearms as \u201cany portable weapons, such as rifles, carbines, machine guns, shotguns or fowling pieces, from which a shot, bullet, or other projectile may be discharged by an explosive.\u201d 26 C.F.R. \u00a7 48.4181-2(c). From this definition, it is clear that a firearm is complete without the items in question, and does not require adjustable rear sights or front sights and compensator units. Consequently, in view of the common meaning of the word accessory, an accessory to a firearm is an item which is of \u201csecondary or subordinate importance\u201d to the function of the firearm.</p>\n<p id=\"b946-6\">This determination is further supported by 26 C.F.R. \u00a7 48.4181-l(a)(2), which lists as examples of accessories, rifle sights, telescopic mounts, and rubber recoil pads, and similar parts of firearms when sold with complete firearms for use as accessories. Rifle sights are specifically mentioned, and the compensator would seem to be similar to the recoil pads. The doctrine of <em>noscitur a sociis </em>permits the Court to ascertain the meaning of ambiguous terms by reference to the terms with which they are associated in the statute or regulations. <em>See, e.g., Nomura (America) Corp. v. United States, </em>62 Cust.Ct. 524, 299 F.Supp. 535 (1969), <em>aff'd, </em>58 C.C.P.A. 82, 435 F.2d 1319 (1971). Any ambiguity as to whether the compensators are accessories, therefore, may be resolved by reference to the specifically named examples of accessories contained in 26 C.F.R. \u00a7 48.-4181-1.</p>\n<p id=\"b946-7\">The best that can be said for the position of the defendant is that there may be some doubt as to the meaning of the word accessories in the pertinent regulation. Even assuming the existence of doubt, it is established that, in a tax refund case, the doubt should be resolved in favor of the taxpayer. <em>See White v. Aronson, </em>302 U.S. 16, 20, 58 S.Ct. 95, 97, 82 L.Ed. 20 (1937); <em>see also Farmar v. United States, </em>689 F.2d 1017, 1020 (Ct.Cl.1982).</p>\n<p id=\"b946-8\">Finally, defendant asserts that the decision of the Claims Court is in accord with the \u201cconsistent\u201d administrative practice of the IRS. Plaintiff concedes that \u201cwhere an accessory is affixed in a permanent manner it becomes indistinguishable from the underlying firearm and is, therefore, rendered taxable.\u201d Plaintiff, however, stresses that \u201c[njever has the government issued a revenue ruling that readily removable and replaceable adjustable rear sights or compen-sators were component parts of firearms and taxable.\u201d</p>\n<p id=\"b946-9\">The administrative rulings cited by the government do not address the specific issues presented in this case. <em>See, e.g., </em>Rev. Rui. 64-201, 1964-2 C.B. 430 (permanently attached part of a shotgun). The cited rulings do not cover a case in which the sights and compensators are <em>not </em>permanently attached. Hence, the weight to be accorded to the IRS rulings is not presented here because the rulings deal with items that are <em>permanently </em>attached or affixed to the article. If the adjustable sights and front sight and compensator unit were permanently attached, the court would have to address the question of the weight to be accorded the rulings, and whether there was a longstanding or clear administrative practice. The court is not persuaded that to hold the items in question to be accessories would be inconsistent with the administrative practice.</p>\n<p id=\"b946-10\">The agreed statement of facts makes clear that both models of carbines are complete without the added items, and are fully functional firearms without them. <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"1572\">*1572</page-number>Hence, since they are not component parts of the firearms, they are accessories. Since the added items are accessories, they are exempt from tax under the existing regulations.</p>\n<p id=\"b947-4\">In view of plaintiffs specific request for relief, the court is not presented with the question as to whether any tax paid on the readily removable standard sights is to be refunded.</p>\n<p id=\"b947-5\">Conclusion</p>\n<p id=\"b947-6\">It is the holding of the court that the adjustable rear sights and the front sight and compensator units of the Auto-Ordnance carbines are accessories within the meaning \u00f3f section 48.4181-l(a)(2), and that the excise tax does not apply to the added value of those parts.</p>\n<p id=\"b947-7\">The order of the Claims Court granting the defendant\u2019s motion for summary judgment is reversed, and the case is remanded for a determination of the specific amount to be refunded.</p>\n<p id=\"b947-8\">REVERSED and REMANDED.</p>\n<footnote label=\"1\">\n<p id=\"b943-8\">. This sum included additional excise taxes on the sale of pistols. Auto-Ordnance has not challenged the portion of the additional tax which pertains to the sale of the pistols.</p>\n</footnote>\n</opinion>\n<opinion data-order=\"9\" data-type=\"opinion\" id=\"x999-3\" type=\"dissent\">\n<author id=\"b947-9\">FRIEDMAN, Circuit Judge,</author>\n<p id=\"AqJj\">dissenting.</p>\n<p id=\"b947-10\">I would affirm the judgment of the Claims Court.</p>\n<p id=\"b947-11\">The issue before this court is a narrow one: whether the Commissioner properly imposed the excise tax on firearms on the additional value of the adjustable rear sight (rear sight) and the front sight and compensator that were part of the appellant\u2019s Deluxe Model carbine. The stipulated facts are that the appellant \u201cadvertised the Deluxe Model and the Standard Model as separate models\u201d of the carbine; that its price list showed separate prices for each of those models; and that in the Deluxe Model the rear sight was \u201cpop riveted\u201d to the carbine at the factory, and the front sight and compensator were installed at the factory. The stipulated facts also are that the Deluxe Model has three additional features not present in the Standard Model.</p>\n<p id=\"b947-12\">In other words, the Deluxe Model was sold as a single unit that included as two of its features the rear sight and the front sight and compensator that the Standard Model did not have. This is not a case where the product is sold in a stripped-down standard version to which the purchaser could add various refinements. The two elements in dispute here were integral parts of the complete weapon sold as the Deluxe Model.</p>\n<p id=\"b947-14\">Neither the statute nor the regulations define the term \u201caccessories,\u201d which are excluded from the excise tax on firearms. Section 48.4181-l(a)(2) of the regulations, however, states that no tax is imposed on the sale of \u201cparts or accessories ... when sold separately or when sold with a complete firearm.\u201d It then explains that no tax attaches to \u201cvarious parts,\u201d which it lists, \u201cwhen sold separately, or when sold with complete firearms for use as spare parts or accessories.\u201d</p>\n<p id=\"b947-15\">Although the rear sight and the front sight and compensator of the Deluxe Model may be viewed as having been \u201csold with complete firearms,\u201d they were not sold \u201cfor use as spare parts or accessories.\u201d They were integral elements of the Deluxe Model, which was sold as a single unit.</p>\n<p id=\"b947-16\">The fact that the carbine could be fired without either the rear sight or the front sight and compensator on it, or that it could be fired from the hip without sighting, does not support the conclusion that those two elements were accessories. There is no reason to believe that the Deluxe Model is not designed and intended to be fired in the usual manner, namely, by aiming at the target through the sights. One of the stipulated facts is that \u201c[t]he combination of the front sight and the rear sight of the Deluxe Model enabled an average marksman to aim the Deluxe Model more accurately than he could with no sight or just one sight.\u201d</p>\n<p id=\"b947-17\">The rear sight and front sight and compensator of the Deluxe Model are not merely accessories, the use of which facilitates, improves, or alters the performance of the carbine. They are integral parts of the weapon that have a significant role in its performance and that presumably influence people to select that model rather than the <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"1573\">*1573</page-number>Standard Model that does not have those features.</p>\n</opinion>\n</casebody>\n",
