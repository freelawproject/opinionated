See N. L. R. B. v. Benevento, 297 F.2d 873 (C.A.l, 1961). Pursuant to our remand the Board recommitted the case to a trial examiner who, after taking further evidence, filed a supplemental intermediate report wherein, on the facts as found, he concluded that during the year preceding the issuance of the complaint in this case the respondent\u2019s \u201coperations affected commerce within the meaning of the Act.\u201d The Board affirmed and has again petitioned this court for enforcement of its original order.</p>\n<p id=\"b277-11\">The respondent has not challenged the findings of fact made by the trial examiner in his supplemental intermediate report and affirmed by the Board in its supplemental decision. We therefore accept the facts found as true. And on them it seems to us clear that the Board\u2019s assertion of jurisdiction is well founded, particularly in view of the Per Curiam reversal by the Supreme Court of the United States, N. L. R. B. v. Reliance Fuel Oil Corp., 371 U.S. 224, 83 S.Ct. 312, 9 L.Ed.2d 279 (1963), of N. L. R. B. v. Reliance Fuel Oil Corp., 297 F.2d 94 (C. A.2, 1961), upon which we in part relied in our earlier opinion.</p>\n<p id=\"b277-14\">The Board in its original order found the respondent guilty of violations of \u00a7 8(a) (1) and (5) of the Act. We have reviewed the original record and briefs and, according due weight to the trial examiner\u2019s and the Board\u2019s resolutions of questions of credibility, it is quite apparent to us that there is substantial evidence in the record considered as a whole to support the Board\u2019s findings of the above violations.</p>\n<p id=\"b277-15\">A decree will be entered enforcing the order of the Board.</p>\n</opinion>\n</casebody>\n",
