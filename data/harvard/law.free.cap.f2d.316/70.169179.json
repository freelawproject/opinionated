Among the scheduled claims was that of the appellee, Industrial Rayon Corporation (\u201cIndustrial\u201d) in the amount of $10,284.33. Industrial subsequently filed a Proof of Claim in the amount of $12,803.99 to which was attached a negotiable promissory note dated March 31, 1959, in the amount of $15,-426.50, payable with interest at <em>&amp;% </em>in sixty days.</p>\n<p id=\"b123-15\">On November 29, 1960, following a 21-A examination of the bankrupt on November 23,1960, Industrial filed Specification of Objections to Discharge asserting that the bankrupt had (1) knowingly and fraudulently concealed assets belonging to the bankrupt estate from the trustee ,and creditors; (2) falsified books of accounts and records; and (3) transferred property within one year preceding the filing of his bankruptcy petition with intent to hinder, delay or defraud his creditors. On December 1, I960 the bankrupt filed Exception to the Specification of Objections on the ground that Industrial was not a creditor of the estate and thus was not qualified to be heard in opposition to the bankrupt\u2019s discharge.</p>\n<p id=\"b123-16\">On June 8, 1961, at an adjourned meeting on Industrial\u2019s Objections, the bankrupt asked, and was granted, (1) leave to amend his Schedule A-3 to delete Industrial as a listed creditor; and (2) to file objections to Industrial\u2019s Proof of Claim. At the close of the June 8th hearing, which was limited to the issue as to Industrial\u2019s status as a creditor, the Referee granted the bankrupt\u2019s application <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"72\">*72</page-number>to amend his Schedule A-3 so as to delete Industrial as a creditor and sustained the bankrupt\u2019s objections to Industrial\u2019s Proof of Claim and his exceptions to Industrial\u2019s Objections to Discharge. In each instance the Referee\u2019s action was grounded on his view that Industrial was not a creditor of the bankrupt by virtue of his signing of the March 31, 1959 promissory note, subsequently to be discussed in detail. On August 11, 1961 the Referee filed Orders giving effect to the rulings above stated and granting the bankrupt his discharge.</p>\n<p id=\"b124-4\">Industrial petitioned for Review of the Referee\u2019s Orders and following hearing thereon the District Court on April 17, 1962 entered its Order vacating all of the Referee\u2019s Orders. This appeal followed.</p>\n<p id=\"b124-5\">It must immediately be stated that the District Court, as evidenced by its Opinion, reported at 204 F.Supp. 106 (E.D.Pa. 1962), directed its attention only to the issue as to whether Industrial did or did not enjoy the status of a creditor by virtue of the March 31, 1959 note and the parties have likewise done so on this appeal.</p>\n<p id=\"b124-6\">The note in controversy reads as follows:</p>\n<blockquote id=\"b124-7\">\u201c$15,426.50 March 31, 1959. \u201cSixty days - after date \u25a0-promise to pay to the order of Industrial Rayon Corporation - Fifteen Thousand Four Hundred Twenty-six and 50/100 Dollars Payable at Cleveland, Ohio with interest at 6'% per annum Value Received</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"AkA\">\u201cLaskin Bros, of Phila. Inc.</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b124-12\">\u201cHarold Laskin</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b124-13\">\u201cNo. K-71730 Due May 30, 1959\u201d</blockquote>\n<p id=\"b124-14\">The names \u201cLaskin Bros, of Phila. Inc.\u201d and \u201cHarold Laskin\u201d were in the bankrupt\u2019s handwriting \u2014 the other portions of the note were printed and typewritten.</p>\n<p id=\"b124-19\">At the time the bankrupt was president of Laskin Brothers of Philadelphia, Inc.</p>\n<p id=\"b124-20\">The District Court held that under the provisions of Section 3-403(2) of the Uniform Commercial Code, as enacted by Pennsylvania,<footnotemark>1</footnotemark> which prevailed when the note was executed, the bankrupt became individually liable on the note when he signed it after writing in. the firm name without any indication that his name was affixed in a representative capacity, and that evidence outside the note was not admissible to show that the bankrupt was not personally liable.</p>\n<p id=\"b124-21\">It was for that reason that the District \u00dcourt held that the Referee had erred in going beyond the contents of the note itself in determining whether or not the bankrupt had become personally liable when he signed it without indicating that his signature was in his capacity as president of Laskin Brothers of Philadelphia, Inc. (\u201cLaskin, Inc.\u201d).</p>\n<p id=\"b124-22\">The record of the proceedings before the Referee evidences that he was of the view that the Bankruptcy Act and not the Uniform Commercial Code controlled and that under the Bankruptcy Act he was empowered to go beyond the borders of the note to ascertain the capacity in which the bankrupt signed it.</p>\n<p id=\"b124-23\">We are of the opinion that the Referee was correct in this respect and for reasons which will subsequently appear we hold that he properly held that the bankrupt\u2019s signature on the note did not result in the creation of a debtor-creditor status between the bankrupt and Industrial.</p>\n<p id=\"b124-24\">One of the primary purposes of the Bankruptcy Act is the equitable distribution of the bankrupt\u2019s estate among its creditors.</p>\n<p id=\"b125-3\"><page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"73\">*73</page-number>These principles are well-settled:</p>\n<blockquote id=\"b125-4\">\u201c * * * [C]ourts of bankruptcy are essentially courts of equity, and their proceedings inherently proceedings in equity.\u201d <footnotemark>2</footnotemark></blockquote>\n<p id=\"b125-5\">The bankruptcy court in passing on claims \u201csits as a court of equity\u201d, and \u201cIn the exercise of its equitable jurisdiction the bankruptcy court <em>has the power to sift the circumstances surrounding any claim </em>to see that injustice or unfairness is not done in the administration of the bankrupt estate.\u201d <footnotemark>3</footnotemark> (emphasis supplied)</p>\n<p id=\"b125-6\">To the foregoing must be added the specific provision of Section 57, sub. k of the Bankruptcy Act that \u201cClaims which have been allowed may be reconsidered for cause and reallowed or rejected in whole or in part <em>according to the equities of the case, </em>before * * * the estate has been closed.\u201d (emphasis supplied)</p>\n<p id=\"b125-7\"> Applying the principles stated it is clear that the Referee properly sifted the circumstances attending the execution of the March 31, 1959 note in the exercise of the equitable jurisdiction vested in him, and that his fact-finding that it was the intention of Industrial and the bankrupt to make only Laskin, Inc. liable on the obligation is amply supported by the evidence.</p>\n<p id=\"b125-8\">On this score it must be stated parenthetically that the District Court did not consider the question as to whether the evidence supported the Referee\u2019s fact-finding and that it premised its reversal of his Order with respect to it only on its view that the Referee was precluded by Pennsylvania law from considering anything but the note itself.</p>\n<p id=\"b125-9\">These facts are undisputed:</p>\n<p id=\"b125-10\">On March 31, 1959 Laskin, Inc. was indebted to Industrial in the amount of $15,246.50 for merchandise. On the same date Industrial sent the following letter:</p>\n<blockquote id=\"b125-17\">\u201cMr. Harold Laskin, President Laskin Bros, of Philadelphia, Inc.

Green et al., 329 U.S. 156, 67 S.Ct. 237, 91 L.Ed. 162 (1946), it was held that in determining whether a claim was allowable the Bankruptcy Court was not bound to apply state law.</p>\n<p id=\"b126-20\">In doing so the Court stated (pp. 162-163, 67 S.Ct. pp. 239-240, 91 L.Ed. 162):</p>\n<blockquote id=\"b126-21\">\u201cIn determining what claims are allowable and how a debtor\u2019s assets shall be distributed, a bankruptcy court does not apply the law of the state where it sits. Erie R. R. v. <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"75\">*75</page-number>Tompkins, 304 U.S. 64 [58 S.Ct. 817, 82 L.Ed. 1188], has no such implication. That case decided that a federal district court acquiring jurisdiction because of diversity of citizenship should adjudicate controversies as if it were only another state court. See Holmberg v. Armbrecht, 327 U.S. 392 [66 S.Ct. 582, 90 L.Ed. 743]. <em>But bankruptcy courts must administer and enforce the Bankruptcy Act as interpreted by this Court in accordance with authority granted by Congress to determine how and what claims shall be allowed under equitable principles.\u201d </em>(emphasis supplied)</blockquote>\n<p id=\"b127-5\">To the same effect see Heiser v. Woodruff, 327 U.S. 726, 732, 66 S.Ct. 853, 90 L.Ed. 970 (1946).</p>\n<p id=\"b127-6\">In Prudence Realization Corp. v. Geist, Trustee, 316 U.S. 89, 62 S.Ct. 978, 86 L.Ed. 1293 (1942) where a state rule established legal consequences to a written undertaking on the ground of \u201cpresumed intention\u201d (just as the Pennsylvania statute here involved did) it was held that a bankruptcy court is not bound by the state rule but can apply equitable principles to determine the actual intent of the parties.</p>\n<p id=\"b127-7\">Said the Court at page 95, 62 S.Ct. at page 982, 86 L.Ed. 1293:</p>\n<blockquote id=\"b127-8\">\u201c[W]e are unable to say that the rule laid down is other than one of state law governing the relative rights of claimants in a state liquidation. Nothing decided in Erie R. Co. v. Tompkins, 304 U.S. 64 [58 S.Ct. 817, 82 L.Ed. 1188], requires a court of bankruptcy to apply such a local rule governing the liquidation of insolvent estates. The bankruptcy act prescribes its own criteria for distribution to creditors. In the Interpretation and application of federal statutes, federal not local law applies.\u201d</blockquote>\n<p id=\"b127-9\">The Bankruptcy Act\u2019s \u201cown criteria for distribution to creditors\u201d was spelled out in Pepper v. Litton, 308 U.S. 295 pp. 304, 305, 60 S.Ct. 238 pp. 244-245, 84 L.Ed. 281 (1939) as follows:</p>\n<blockquote id=\"b127-11\">\u201cBy virtue of \u00a7 2 a bankruptcy court is a court of equity at least in the sense that in the exercise of the jurisdiction conferred upon it by the Act, it applies the principles and rules of equity jurisprudence. * * Among the granted powers are the allowance and disallowance of claims; the collection and distribution of the estates of bankrupts and the determination of controversies in relation thereto; the rejection in whole or in part \u2018according to the' equities of the case\u2019 of claims previously allowed; and the entering of such judgments \u2018as may be necessary for the enforcement of the provisions\u2019 of the Act. * * *</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b127-12\">\u201cThe bankruptcy courts have exercised these equitable powers in passing on a wide range of problems arising out of the administration of bankrupt estates. They have been invoked to the end that fraud will not prevail, <em>that substance mil not give way to form, that technical considerations will not prevent substantial justice from being done.\u201d </em>(emphasis supplied)</blockquote>\n<p id=\"b127-13\">It must be here observed that even under the 1953 provisions of the Pennsylvania Uniform Commercial Code parol evidence was admissible to effect a reformation of a note so as to show that it was signed in a representative capacity where an \u201cinjustice\u201d resulted because of the Code proviso that \u201c[a]n authorized representative who signs his own name to an instrument is also personally obligated unless the instrument names the person represented and shows that the signature is made in a representative capacity.\u201d Section 3-403(2).</p>\n<p id=\"b127-14\">In the Uniform Commercial Code Comment, paragraph 3 (12A P.S. \u00a7 3-403. p. 582) it is said:</p>\n<blockquote id=\"b127-15\">\u201cSubsection (2) is intended to provide a rule of law for the determination of the effect of the representative\u2019s signature from the face of the <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"76\">*76</page-number>instrument. It excludes parol evidence for any purpose except reformation. * * *</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b128-4\">\u201cThe rule here stated is that the representative is liable personally unless the instrument itself clearly shows that he has signed only on behalf of another named on the paper. If he does not sign in such a way as to make that clear the responsibility is his. If there is injustice to him he may have the remedy of reformation, subject to the rules of the particular jurisdiction; * *</blockquote>\n<p id=\"b128-5\">It is necessary that we direct our attention to the problem presented by the circumstance that the District Court\u2019s Order, from which this appeal was taken, not only vacated separate Orders of the Referee amending the appellant\u2019s Schedule A-3 by deleting the name of Industrial as a creditor of the estate and disallowing Industrial\u2019s claim, but also vacated the Referee\u2019s third Order which not only sustained the appellant\u2019s exceptions to the Specification of Discharge filed by Industrial and dismissed the Objections, but also granted the appellant his discharge.</p>\n<p id=\"b128-6\">The record of the proceedings before the Referee discloses that there was a 21-A examination of the appellant. In Industrial\u2019s Specification of Objections to Discharge it was alleged that the 21-A examination established \u201cthat the bankrupt [appellant] knowingly and fraudulently concealed from the trustee and creditors * * * property belonging to the estate of the bankrupt, and knowingly and fraudulently made a false oath or account in relation to a bankruptcy.\u201d</p>\n<p id=\"b128-8\">The Referee apparently was of the view that the sustaining of the appellant\u2019s exceptions to the Specification of Objections on the ground that Industrial had no standing to object to the appellant\u2019s discharge in view of its lack of creditor status obviated the necessity of his further consideration or disposition of the serious charges of misconduct made in the Specification. The Referee erred in this respect. He was duty bound to inquire into the merit of the charges of fraud made in the Objections although he had properly sustained exceptions to them by reason of his correct holding that Industrial lacked the status, to make the Objections. The allegations of fraudulent conduct made in the Objections were not lost to the bankruptcy court by reason of their having been struck down under the circumstances here existing.</p>\n<p id=\"b128-10\">A charge of fraud is not an issue merely between the bankrupt and a given creditor \u201c * * * but involves the integrity of the law itself; only such bankrupts are entitled to procure a discharge as have not <em>offended </em>against certain provisions of the Act, and in the administration of the discharge sections, the courts rest under a duty of inquiry.\u201d In re Povill, 30 F.Supp. 161 (E.D.N.Y. 1939). In In re Sims, 26 F.Supp. 933 (N.D.W.Va.1939) it was held that it was the duty of a bankruptcy court to require an investigation where Objections disclose acts of fraud even though the objecting creditor withdraws them. In that case the District Court ordered that the United States Attorney be requested to investigate the conduct of the bankrupt even though the Referee had granted the bankrupt his discharge after Objections had been withdrawn and no creditor had opposed confirmation of the discharge.</p>\n<p id=\"b128-12\">The appellant contends \u201cthat the issue of fraud is properly before this Appellate Court and that on the evidence this court should reverse the District Court and reinstate the order granting the discharge.\u201d</p>\n<p id=\"b128-13\">The issue of fraud was not before the District Court inasmuch as the Referee in his certification to it did not include the Notes of Testimony of the 21-A proceeding and for that reason we cannot dispose of it on this appeal.</p>\n<p id=\"b128-14\">Accordingly, upon remand the District Court should direct that the Referee supplement his certification by the inclusion of the Notes of Testimony of the 21-A proceeding. When the record is so sup<page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"77\">*77</page-number>plemented the District Court will be in a position to make an evaluation of the charges of fraudulent conduct on the part of the appellant bankrupt and to take such action as it may deem requisite under the circumstances.</p>\n<p id=\"b129-4\">If it finds the charges sufficiently serious it may instruct the trustee in bankruptcy or the United States Attorney to proceed with them in accordance with the provisions o\u00ed the Bankruptcy Act.<footnotemark>6</footnotemark></p>\n<p id=\"b129-5\">The Order of the District Court will be vacated and the cause will be remanded with directions to proceed in accordance with this Opinion.</p>\n<footnote label=\"1\">\n<p id=\"b124-15\">.
