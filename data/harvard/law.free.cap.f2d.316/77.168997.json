Concededly, under the policy here in suit, appellant assumed no liability for \u201cProducts\u2014 Completed Operations.\u201d Appellees do not assert that it did. They affirm that the \u201coccurrence\u201d in question arose from \u201cbusiness operations\u201d hazards created by appellant\u2019s \u201cNamed Insured\u201d in relation to the \u201cownership, maintenance or <em>use </em>of premises and <em>all </em>operations,\u201d as those hazards are defined and coverage provided therefor in appellant\u2019s policy.</p>\n<p id=\"b130-9\">Since there is no dispute between the parties as to the facts leading up to. the \u201coccurrence\u201d in question; and District Judge Miller in his memorandum opinion, found at 204 F.Supp. 713, has set forth all the stipulated facts giving rise thereto, as well as a verbatim copy of the relevant \u201ccoverage\u201d and \u201cInsuring agreements\u201d contained in the policy of insurance here to be considered, we appropriate his statement of the facts there made and incorporate the same herein by reference \u2014 thereby shortening what would otherwise require an extended opinion from us in the disposition of this appeal.</p>\n<p id=\"b130-12\">But, to give some continuity to the instant opinion, we think these background facts should be related: On June 6, 1961, an inboard motorboat owned by William T. Stover caught fire and burned on Lake Hamilton, near Hot Springs National Park, Arkansas. Seven passengers were in that boat, in addition to Stover. All the occupants thereof suffered personal injuries as a result of the fire. As a consequence, suits were filed in the courts of the State of Arkansas by all those injured parties, naming appellee Willis- P. Coleman, d/b/a Lake Hamilton Marine Service, and Morgan Agar, an employee of Coleman, as defendants. It was alleged in each of the complaints filed in those lawsuits that the fire and resulting injuries to the occupants of the boat were proximately caused by negligence on the part of Agar, which specific claim of negligence was imputed to Coleman, appellant\u2019s named insured. In due course, Coleman called upon appellant to defend the lawsuits arising out of that \u201coccurrence\u201d and to pay any judgments that might be recovered in the actions commenced against him, up to the limits of liability provided by its policy. . Appellant, after denying that the \u201coccurrence\u201d was within the coverage of its policy, brought the instant action in the United States District Court for the Western District of Arkansas, seeking a declaratory judgment to have that issue determined with finality. The District Court denied appellant declaratory relief as prayed. It ruled that under the particular circumstances here established, coverage for the above \u201coccurrence\u201d was provided by appellant\u2019s insurance policy.</p>\n<p id=\"b130-13\">The agreed-to facts establish that, prior to the fire, Stover had moored his boat at Coleman\u2019s boat-dock for the purpose of refueling. Agar, Coleman\u2019s em<page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"79\">*79</page-number>ployee, acting in the scope of his employment, undertook to perform that operation. In so doing, when he removed the cap from the gas tank of Stover\u2019s boat, he also disconnected the pipe between the cap and the gasoline tank. As a consequence, in performing the operation of refueling, a portion of the intended fuel missed the tank and ran down into the bilge of the boat. It is Agar\u2019s negligent performance of that operation which is asserted by appellees to be the proximate cause of their injuries and a \u201chazard\u201d within the ambit of \u201cPremises \u2014 Operations\u201d coverage afforded by appellant\u2019s policy.</p>\n<p id=\"b131-4\">The gist of appellant\u2019s assertion of non-coverage for the \u201coccurrence\u201d is that the above facts establish appellees\u2019 claims to be within the \u201cProducts \u2014 Completed Operations\u201d coverage of its policy. That coverage has an exclusion contained therein that \u201cif the accident occurs after possession of such goods or products (i. e. those \u2018manufactured, sold, handled or distributed by the Named Insured\u2019) has been relinquished to others * * * and if an accident occurs away from premises owned, rented or controlled by the Named Insured\u201d coverage for such an \u201coccurrence\u201d is not afforded by its policy. Appellant factually buttresses its argument as to that contention in item 10 of the stipulated facts (1. c. 716) and \u201cDivision 4 * * * Products \u2014 Completed Operations\u201d (1. c. 718) set forth in Judge Miller\u2019s opinion, supra. That is to say * * * solely because Stover\u2019s boat had drifted a distance of seventy-three feet from the dock when it caught fire as a result of the negligent refueling \u201coperation\u201d by Agar, appellant contends that such \u201coccurrence\u201d was not on property \u201cowned, rented or controlled\u201d by the named insured. However, appellant conceeds that Coleman at times had \u201cused the waters\u201d of Lake Hamilton where the fire occurred, for the \u201cmooring\u201d of boats and had a right to so use those waters in the \u201coperations\u201d of his \u201cbusiness\u201d. But it says, \u201csuch right of use does not establish that Coleman \u2018controlled\u2019 the waters\u201d where the fire occurred. It is from that singular premise of \u201ccontrol\u201d that appellant asserts \u201cnon-coverage\u201d under its liability policy. We do not believe that the place where the Stover boat was located when it caught fire as a result of Agar\u2019s negligence, is decisive of appellant\u2019s liability coverage under the facts here and the insuring provisions of its policy.</p>\n<p id=\"b131-7\">To bring that basic issue into clearer mental focus it should be noted that there are several different classifications or \u201cdivisions\u201d of risks set forth in appellant\u2019s policy as reproduced at 204 F.Supp., l. c. 717. We are here concerned only with \u201cPremises \u2014 Operations\u201d and \u201cProducts \u2014 Completed Operations.\u201d It should be clearly understood that appellees make no claim of coverage under appellant\u2019s policy for \u201cProducts \u2014 Completed Operations\u201d hazard as defined therein. It is appellant alone who undertakes to steer the personal injury claims made against its \u201cNamed Insured\u201d into that channel of coverage. It asserts that the decision of the District Court is premised in a ruling that coverage for the above \u201coccurrence\u201d was within \u201cProducts \u2014 Completed Operations\u201d because the opinion of the trial court contains the statement that \u201cthe gasoline was never delivered to the operator of the boat\u201d and that \u201cas a practical matter the gasoline\u201d that found its way into \u201cthe bilge of the boat could not be construed as being in possession of the operator of the boat.\u201d As a consequence, appellant states:</p>\n<blockquote id=\"b131-8\">\u201cIn spite of these statements, (by the District Court) it seems quite clear that the accident occurred \u2018after possession of such goods or products has (sic) been relinquished to others by the Named Insured,\u2019 and, if the injur\u00e9d parties alleged a claim against the insured because of the <em>nature </em>or <em>condition </em>of the Product, it would still be necessary to determine only whether the <em>accident </em>occurred \u2018away from the premises owned, rented or controlled by the Named Insured,\u2019 <em>which is the same question presented under the \u2018Com</em><page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"80\">*80</page-number><em>pleted Operations\u2019 hazard\u201d of its policy. </em>(Par. and Emp. added.)</blockquote>\n<p id=\"b132-5\">We consider the above argument to be not only a misinterpretation of Judge Miller\u2019s opinion, supra, but also the italicized parts thereof are an erroneous interpretation of the \u201cInsuring Agreements\u201d contained in its policy of insurance. First, because the appellees do not make any claim that they were injured \u201cbecause of the <em>nature </em>or <em>condition\u201d </em>of the gasoline sold to Stover. Secondly, it appears from Judge Miller\u2019s opinion that he found the negligent act of Agar which occurred at Coleman\u2019s dock to be in relation to \u201cBusiness Operations\u201d of Coleman, and that such was the proximate cause of the fire and injury to those in Stover\u2019s boat. True, his opinion contains the statements <em>ante, </em>but it is apparent from his opinion considered as a whole that such statements were made in relation to his consideration of the facts, that the fire occurred within the confines of an area of the waters of Lake Hamilton used by Coleman in doing business as \u201cLake Hamilton Marine Service.\u201d That is, in an area where Coleman had \u201cmoored\u201d boats of some customers in the course of his business operations. We need not sound out the \u201carea\u201d of Coleman\u2019s business operations as Judge Miller apparently did. All we here note is that the \u201clocation of all premises owned, rented or controlled by the Named Insured\u201d is not defined in appellant\u2019s policy. From the facts in the case at bar, a reasonable inference can be made that the policy as issued was intended to cover all of Coleman\u2019s business \u201coperations\u201d ; and that appellant knew or should have known that he \u201cused\u201d the waters of Lake Hamilton where the fire occurred, in the operations of his business and had a right to do so. Regardless, the place where the fire \u201coccurred\u201d is not here controlling under the \u201cPremises \u2014 Operations\u201d coverage afforded by appellant\u2019s policy.</p>\n<p id=\"b132-6\">An examination of the divisions of coverage of that policy reveals \"Premises \u2014 Operations\u201d to be a hazard and risk listed separate and apart from \u201cProducts \u2014 Completed Operations.\u201d That establishes that there is a recognized difference between those two defined coverages. Such difference is further recognized in the fact that the policy provides for a different rate of premium to be paid for those divisions of coverage. Further, in the \u201cDefinition of Hazards\u201d (204 F.Supp., l. c. 718) as related to \u201cPremises \u2014 Operations,\u201d the policy specifically reveals that hazards insured thereunder are related to \u201cthe ownership, maintenance or <em>use </em>of premises, and <em>all operations.\u201d </em>(Emp. added.) From this latter provision alone it is established that the term \u201call operations\u201d was intended to include \u201cactivities\u201d performed in relation to \u201cuse of premises\u201d by the named insured in relation to his business operations, namely: \u201cBoat Yards \u2014 Public\u2014including sale of boats, accessories, gasoline and oil, boat building and repair \u2014 Boat storage and moorage including ship or dock rental\u201d as defined in the declaration of the Policy. As to the above-stated \u201cPremises \u2014 Operations\u201d hazards, there is no provision of the policy coupling the definition thereof with that of \u201cProducts \u2014 Completed Operations.\u201d Appellant by its brief does not undertake to factually demonstrate that \u201cPremises \u2014 Operations\u201d and \u201cProducts \u2014 Completed Operations\u201d are correlated, defined hazards. All that it does is articulate \u201cthat the same question presented under the Products \u2014 Completed Operations of its policy applies to Premises \u2014 Operations.\u201d We do not believe its policy is subject to that interpretation.</p>\n<p id=\"b132-8\">Under the terms of appellant\u2019s policy, \u201cProducts \u2014 Completed Operations\u201d is the only coverage related to \u201caway from premises\u201d exclusion. There is no such limitation or exclusion from coverage as to \u201cPremises \u2014 Operations.\u201d Appellant\u2019s attempt to read that limitation into the \u201cPremises \u2014 Operations\u201d coverage is not justified by any rule of construction known to us. An unbiased reading of appellant\u2019s policy must convince a reasonable mind that such is not a proper legal interpretation thereof. <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"81\">*81</page-number>For certain, the most that can be said regarding appellant\u2019s contention is, that if its policy is to be so construed, then it is certainly \u201cambiguous\u201d and any such ambiguity is to be resolved against it. O\u2019Connor v. Great Lakes Pipe Line Co., 63 F.2d 523 (8 Cir. 1933); Axt v. London &amp; Lancaster Indemnity Co., 7 Cir., 131 F.2d 370; Zurich General Accident &amp; Liability Co. v. Simms, 194 Ark. 676, 109 S.W.2d 933. We reject appellant\u2019s contention that coverage for the \u201coccurrence\u201d in question is within \u201cProducts\u2014 Completed Operations\u201d hazards as defined in its policy; and, that the exclusions relating to that hazard are to be read into the \u201cPremises \u2014 Operations\u201d coverage of its policy.</p>\n<p id=\"b133-4\">The sum and substance of appellant\u2019s contention of noncoverage under the latter hazard is that * * * assuming the gasoline transferred from Coleman\u2019s pumps to Stover\u2019s boat by Agar was a negligent operation, yet it says the fire resulting from that operation, having occurred after Stover\u2019s boat moved some seventy feet from the Coleman dock, was not within the coverage of its policy because it was \u201caway from the premises owned, rented or controlled by the Named Insured.\u201d That is tantamount to saying that negligent \u201cPremises \u2014 Operations\u201d being the proximate cause of an injury is the same as \u201cProducts \u2014 Completed Operations.\u201d That is not so. The differences between \u201cPremises \u2014 Operations\u201d and \u201cProducts \u2014 Completed Operations\u201d are clearly defined as separate hazards in appellant\u2019s policy. By the terms thereof a specific exclusion appears for occurrences away from premises when related to \u201cProducts \u2014 Completed Operations\u201d hazards. But language so providing does not avoid coverage provided therein for the specifically defined \u201cPremises \u2014 Operations\u201d hazard. Appellant has not sustained the burden of establishing that the negligent \u201cPremises \u2014 Operation\u201d performed by Agar, which is established to be the proximate cause of the \u201coccurrence\u201d in question, is excluded from coverage under its policy. Zurich General Accident &amp; Liability Ins. Co., Ltd. v. Simms, supra.</p>\n<p id=\"b133-8\">Appellant\u2019s contention that the exclusion, \u201caway from the premises owned, rented or controlled\u201d by its \u201cNamed Insured\u201d should be construed as being within the coverage of \u201cPremises \u2014 Operations\u201d hazards afforded by its policy under the facts here is wholly without merit.
