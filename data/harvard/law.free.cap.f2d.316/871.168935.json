Nearly a year later, plaintiffs served notice of a motion, stated to be pursuant to F.R.Civ.Proc. 60, asking \u201cthat the said judgment be vacated and set aside on the ground that such judgment was contrary to the law and contrary to the evidence upon which the said judgment was entered,\u201d or, in the alternative, that it \u201cbe resettled and re-entered in order to permit the plaintiffs to file a notice of appeal therefrom.\u201d In addition to re-arguing the merits, and claiming that under Rule 58 the Clerk had no power to enter the judgment, the moving affidavit alleged that plaintiffs\u2019 attorney was on vacation when the judgment was entered and did not learn of its entry until after the time to appeal had expired. An opposing affidavit stated that notice of the decision had appeared in the New York Law Journal on July 3, 1961, and that the Government had received postcard notice of entry of judgment from the Clerk on that day. From Judge Bryan\u2019s denial of their motion, plaintiffs appeal; their brief in this Court suggests that the Clerk\u2019s notice to their attorney may have been sent to a former office address and may thus have miscarried. The order denying the motion under Rule 60(b) is appealable under 28 U.S.C. \u00a7 1291, but the appeal brings up only the denial of the motion and not the judgment itself. 7 Moore, Federal Practice (2d ed. 1955), JT 60.30[3].</p>\n<p id=\"b924-12\">The catch-all clause of Rule 60 (b) (6), authorizing the court to relieve a party from a judgment for \u201cany other reason justifying relief,\u201d cannot be read to encompass a claim of error for which appeal is the proper remedy; such a reading would emasculate the provisions of Rule 73(a), now codified in 28 U.S.C. \u00a7 2107, which strictly limit the time for appeal, and which are reinforced by the last clause of Rule 6(b) and the last sentence of Rule 77(d). Elgin Nat\u2019l Watch Co. v. Barrett, 213 F.2d 776, 779-780 (5 Cir. 1954). Appellants\u2019 reliance on Hill v. Hawes, 320 U.S. 520, 64 S.Ct. 334, 88 L.Ed. 283 (1944), in support of their alternative request for resettlement of the judgment ignores the fact that, as explained in our recent opinion in Lieberman v. Gulf Oil Corp., 315 F.2d 403 (2 Cir., 1963), the purpose of the 1946 amendments of Rule 73(a) and 77(d) was to substitute for the open-ended possibilities suggested by that decision the strictly limited relief now authorized by Rule 73(a). We need not consider whether this was a case of \u201cexcusable neglect based on a failure of a party to learn of the entry of the judgment\u201d as that Rule requires. For the Rule also limits the power of the district court to grant relief on such a showing to an extension of 30 days from the expiration of the original time for appeal, and here the district court has granted no extension and could not lawfully have done so, since the request therefor was not made until nearly ten months after the time to appeal had expired. Any moderation of the rigors of the \u201cexcusable neglect\u201d clause worked by Harris Trunk Lines, Inc. v. Cherry Meat Packers, Inc., 371 U.S. 215, 83 S.Ct. 283, 9 L.Ed.2d 261 (1963), or by our decision in Lieberman v. Gulf Oil Corp., supra, responsive to our understanding of the Harris case, goes only to the \u201cdeference\u201d declared by the <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"873\">*873</page-number>Supreme Court to be due to certain orders of the district courts <em>within </em>the time limits stated in the Rule.</p>\n<p id=\"b925-5\">The 1946 amendment of Rule 58 substituted the words \u201call relief be denied\u201d for the former phrase \u201cthere [shall] be no recovery\u201d and thus broadened the authority of the Clerk to enter a judgment without the need of settlement by the court. See the Advisory Committee\u2019s Notes. The contention that this had the unexpected effect of narrowing the Rule so as to eliminate the Clerk\u2019s power to enter a grant of summary judgment dismissing a complaint is so patently frivolous that statement is a sufficient answer.</p>\n<p id=\"b925-6\">Affirmed.</p>\n</opinion>\n</casebody>\n",
