Baldwin, a person designated in Section 1114 of Title 18 of the United States Code while said William H. Baldwin was engaged in the performance of his official duties and on account of the performance of his official duties, all in violation of Title 18, United States Code, Section 111.\u201d</p>\n<p id=\"b539-12\">Defendant pleaded not guilty and seasonably moved to dismiss the indictment because of a failure to allege that defendant was aware, at the time of the alleged offense, that Baldwin (1) \u201cwas an officer of the United States\u201d and (2) \u201cwas engaged in the performance of his official duties.\u201d This motion was denied.</p>\n<p id=\"b539-14\">The case proceeded to trial and following the close of the prosecution\u2019s opening statement \u2014 wherein the prosecutor alluded to no prospective proof that the defendant knew the official status of Baldwin \u2014 defendant moved for a judgment of acquittal. The trial judge denied this motion also.</p>\n<p id=\"b539-15\">At the trial the Government offered testimony that the defendant had virtually run over \u2014 with his automobile \u2014 a Deputy United States Marshal who had tried to serve him with a subpoena. There was evidence from which a jury could properly have concluded that the defendant had been made aware of the official status of the Deputy Marshal and that he had deliberately plunged his car forward \u2014 heedless of the possibility of bodily harm to the Marshal \u2014 in order to avert being served.</p>\n<p id=\"b539-16\">In this court, defendant raises three contentions. Initially he argues that the indictment was fatally defective because of the failure to allege that defendant knew that Baldwin was a government officer engaged in the performance of his official duties. Second, it is argued that the trial judge erred in denying defendant\u2019s motion for judgment of acquittal following the Government\u2019s opening statement because of the prosecutor\u2019s failure to state that the Government would prove that Baldwin was a Government officer engaged in the performance of his official duties. Finally, defendant urges that the evidence is insufficient to sustain a conviction.</p>\n<p id=\"b539-17\">In our view there is no question that there was abundant evidence from which the jury properly could have found the defendant guilty as charged and, consequently, we pass quickly over the defendant\u2019s argument as to the sufficiency of the evidence.</p>\n<p id=\"b539-18\">The major issue posed by defendant is where an indictment alleging an assault on a federal officer under 18 U.S.C. \u00a7 111, is deficient if it does not allege that the <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"488\">*488</page-number>defendant was aware that his victim was a federal officer. The Government argues that scienter on the part of the defendant, as to the official character of the victim, is not an essential element of this type of offense. It argues that the gist of the offense resides in the fact that the defendant has engaged in a certain course of illegal <em>conduct </em>\u2014 malum <em>in se </em>\u2014 and the additional fact that the victim happens to be a federal officer is relevant only for jurisdictional purposes. In support of this argument, the Government relies largely on the recent decision of the United States Court of Appeals for the Fifth Circuit in Bennett v. United States, 285 F.2d 567, 570 (1960), which squarely sustains the position for which the Government here contends.</p>\n<p id=\"b540-3\">The defendant, on the other hand, while recognizing the fact that Bennett is highly apposite, attempts to discredit the result on the basis that the holding is out of consonance with a significant line of cases starting with Pettibone v. United States, 148 U.S. 197, 13 S.Ct. 542, 37 L.Ed. 419 (1893), holding that knowledge of the official character of the officer is an essential element of the offense charged, and an indictment which failed to allege this element is fatally defective. See, e. g., Sparks v. United States, 90 F.2d 61 (6th Cir., 1937); United States v. Miller, 17 F.R.D. 486 (D.C.Vt.1955). Defendant further contends that the authority of Bennett is weakened by the faet that there the court failed even to mention its two prior rulings holding that seienter was an essential element of this type of offense. See, Hall v. United States, 235 F.2d 248 (5th Cir., 1956); Hargett v. United States, 183 F.2d 859 (5th Cir., 1950).</p>\n<p id=\"b540-4\">While it may be possible to reconcile these authorities, in our view, it is not essential for us to do so in the instant case. Rather, here we need not reach the question of whether an indictment which failed to allege scienter would be defective because in our view the present indictment did in fact fairly charge the defendant with knowledge of the marshal\u2019s official status.</p>\n<p id=\"b540-5\">It is a cardinal principle of our criminal law that an indictment is sufficient which apprises a defendant of the crime with which he is charged so as to enable him to prepare his defense and to plead judgment of acquittal or conviction as a plea to a subsequent prosecution for the same offense. United States v. Cruikshank, 92 U.S. 542, 23 L.Ed. 588 (1895); United States v. Crummer, 151 F.2d 958 (10th Cir., 1945); United States v. Pope, 189 F.Supp. 12 (S.D.N.Y.1960).</p>\n<p id=\"b540-6\">An examination of Section 111 shows that it defines the instant offense as assault upon a federal officer \u201cwhile engaged in <em>or on account of the performance of his official duties.\u201d </em>(Emphasis supplied). Following the words of the statute, the indictment in this case charged that the defendant assaulted the marshal \u201cwhile (he) was engaged in the performance of his official duties <em>and </em>on account of the performance of his official duties * * We believe that an allegation averring that a defendant embarked upon a given course of conduct \u201con account of\u201d \u2014or for the reason that \u2014 his victim was performing official duties must necessarily imply the defendant\u2019s knowledge or awareness of the cloak of officiality with which his victim was garbed at the critical moment. In other words, it is difficult for us to perceive how an assault could be made \u201con account of\u201d the performance of the victim\u2019s official duties, without knowledge that the victim either was performing, or had performed official duties which were indeed the impelling motive for the assault. See, Sparks v. United States, supra; see also, Parsons v. United States, 189 F.2d 252, 253 (5th Cir., 1951).</p>\n<p id=\"b540-7\">In sum, we believe that the instant indictment fairly apprised the defendant of all the elements of the offense with which he was charged and against which he had to defend. In this day, more than this an accused may not ask. As was stated in Parsons v. United States, supra: \u201cThe cynically technical approach which formerly enshrouded the consideration of even the plainest and simplest indictments, <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"489\">*489</page-number>and, in many instances, made a mockery of simple justice, no longer governs their consideration.\u201d Id. at 253.</p>\n<p id=\"Ajg\">There remains the question of whether the trial judge erred in denying appellant\u2019s motion for judgment of acquittal following the Government\u2019s opening statement because of the prosecutor\u2019s asserted failure to state that the defendant knew that his victim was a federal officer.</p>\n<p id=\"b541-7\">We have carefully considered defendant\u2019s contention but believe that where the indictment alleges the elements of the offense and the evidence adduced at the trial touches these elements, the defendant cannot claim prejudicial error for failure of the trial judge to acquit on the basis of a prosecutor\u2019s opening statement.</p>\n<p id=\"b541-8\">Judgment will be entered affirming the judgment of the district court.</p>\n</opinion>\n</casebody>\n",
