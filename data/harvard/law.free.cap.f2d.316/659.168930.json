In this petition for review, Panhandle\u2019s only complaint relates to the rate allowed on the reserves.</p>\n<p id=\"b713-3\"><page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"661\">*661</page-number>These reserves are generated by Panhandle\u2019s use of \u00a7 167 of the Internal Revenue Code<footnotemark>2</footnotemark> which authorizes taxpayers to write off depreciable property more quickly than is permitted under the \u201cstraight-line\u201d method of depreciation. The liberalized method provides higher depreciation deductions and therefore lower taxes during the early part of the life of a given property, and lower deductions and higher taxes in the later years of the life of the property. The total depreciation deductions available to a company over the entire life of a facility are the same using either method. The comparative advantage provided by liberalized depreciation is that it defers to the later life of a given property a portion of the taxes on income that would be payable in the early years under straight-line depreciation, and gives the company the use of such moneys in the interval. Liberalized depreciation under \u00a7 167 is thus said to result in tax deferrals rather than tax savings. Cf. City of Detroit, Mich. v. Federal Power Comm., 97 U.S.App.D.C. 260, 230 F.2d 810 (1955); El Paso Natural Gas Co. v. Federal Power Comm., 281 F.2d 567, 573 (5th Cir.1960). But see Eisner, Depreciation under the New Tax Law, 33 Harv.Bus.Rev.No. 1, pp. 66-74.</p>\n<p id=\"b713-4\">In City of Detroit, we sustained the \u2022Commission\u2019s action in permitting Panhandle (1) to use the straight-line method of depreciation in fixing its .rates, while using the accelerated method for computing its tax expense, .and (2) to include reserves for deferred taxes in its rate base. We rejected -a rate-payer\u2019s objection that such treatment did not produce the \u201clowest reason.able rates\u201d required by \u00a7 5(a) of the Natural Gas Act.<footnotemark>3</footnotemark> But the question of what return, if any, should be allowed \u2022on reserve funds included in the rate base was not before us in City of Detroit. It is the sole question presented in this case.</p>\n<p id=\"b713-5\">Here the Commission, following its \u2022decision in Northern Natural Gas Co., 25 F.P.C. 431 (1961), \u201cdivided the benefits of liberalized depreciation between the regulated company and the rate-payer\u201d giving the \u201cmajor portion of the benefits to the rate-payer.\u201d It permitted Panhandle \u201conly so much of [a return on funds generated by the use of liberalized depreciation] as is necessary to provide it with a sufficient incentive to continue to use liberalized depreciation.\u201d Thus, a substantially lower rate of return was attributed to those funds than to other capital.</p>\n<p id=\"b713-8\">Panhandle insists that Congress intended all the benefits of liberalized depreciation for the taxpayer and none for the rate-payer. Accordingly, it urges that the tax statute assures a \u201cfull return\u201d on the deferred tax reserves equivalent to the rate of return of 6.46 percent which the Commission allowed on other investment.</p>\n<p id=\"b713-9\">In their briefs, the Commission and some of the State Commissions suggest that the regulatory treatment of tax benefits is entirely a matter of discretion and policy within the administrative competence of the agencies charged with regulating rates, and that consequently the Commission would have power to deny the company <em>any </em>return on the funds generated by liberalized depreciation and to <em>require </em>the companies to continue to utilize such depreciation. But the Commission did not follow that course. Instead, it sought to give \u201csuch effect to the purposes of the tax statute as is appropriate within the principles of regulatory law expressed in the Natural Gas Act.\u201d We therefore intimate no opinion concerning the validity of the course proposed in the briefs, and consider only the Commission\u2019s action under review.</p>\n<p id=\"b713-10\">In reviewing that action, we must first decide whether the congressional purposes underlying the tax and gas acts are effectuated by permitting a rate of return on the funds generated by the use of liberalized depreciation no higher than that required to provide the company with \u201ca sufficient incentive to continue <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"662\">*662</page-number>to use liberalized depreciation.\u201d And if they are, we must then decide whether 1.5 per cent constitutes such a rate of return.</p>\n<p id=\"b714-4\">We now briefly consider the policy underlying \u00a7 167 of the tax statute. Nothing in the language or legislative history indicates that Congress considered its regulatory consequences. Thus, to infer that the statute materially altered fundamental principles of rate regulation \u2014 which require rates to reflect actual costs of capital \u2014 it must clearly appear that Congress intended to benefit producers to the exclusion of consumers. It does not so appear: the legislative history reveals that Congress intended the statute \u201cto have far-reaching economic effects\u201d extending to \u201call segments of the American economy.\"<footnotemark>4</footnotemark> Liberalized depreciation was seen as a means toward a broad economic goal; it was expected to \u201cassist modernization and expansion of industrial capacity, with resulting economic growth, increased production, and a higher standard of living.\u201d (House and Senate Reports accompanying Internal Revenue Code of 1954, reprinted in U.S.Code Cong. &amp; Ad. News, 83d Cong., 2d Sess. Vol. 3, 4046-48, 4655, 4835.)</p>\n<p id=\"b714-6\">To set this economic spiral in motion, producers must, of course, be willing to invest in plant and incur the attendant risks. Congress permitted \u201cacceleration in the speed of the tax-free recovery of costs [because it considered this] of critical importance in the decision of management to incur [such], risks.\u201d Ibid. The Commission\u2019s decision does not disturb this acceleration; it relates only to the rate of return allowed a regulated company on the reinvestment of the money thus recovered. Although Congress was not directly concerned with this rate, it may be argued that to the extent that this rate influences the company\u2019s initial decision to invest in plant, it does touch upon the congressional purpose underlying the tax act. But even under this view, the congressional purpose could not be adversely affected unless the regulated companies were prevented from re-employing recovered funds at a sufficient profit to provide incentive to initial investment.</p>\n<p id=\"b714-7\">The Commission explicitly rested its determination on the judgment that the rate of return it allowed on the recovered funds, taken with the other \u201cmaterial advantages,\u201d<footnotemark>5</footnotemark> would provide the company \u201cwith a sufficient incentive to con<page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"663\">*663</page-number>tinue to use liberalized depreciation * * *_\u00bb This implicitly recognizes that, since the recovered funds were acquired at no cost to the company, and since the risks involved in their reinvestment are minimal as compared with the risks generally encountered by non-regulated producers, a return of 1.5 per cent provides sufficient profit incentive for the company to continue generating these funds by investing in plant and utilizing accelerated depreciation.</p>\n<p id=\"b715-4\">Since there is no indication that \u2022Congress intended to bestow upon the producers <em>qua </em>producers any benefits beyond those necessary to provide incentives to investment, we conclude that, if a return of 1.5 per cent taken with the other advantages does provide such incentive, the Commission\u2019s decision would be \u2022consistent with the congressional policy underlying the tax statute.</p>\n<p id=\"b715-5\">Next we consider \u201cthe principles of regulatory law expressed in the Natural Gas Act,\u201d which impelled the Commission to allow no more of a return on these funds than that necessary to effectuate the tax act. These principles include the requirement that a public \u2022utility must operate on the most economical basis consistent with good service and sound finance. Implicit in this requirement is the rule that the rates \u2022charged must reflect the company\u2019s actual total costs, including its cost of capital. Since the capital represented by the funds generated by accelerated depreciation cost the company nothing, sound principles of rate regulation support the Commission\u2019s decisions to permit the company no more of a return on these funds than that necessary to effectuate the congressional policy underlying the tax statute. See Cities of Lexington, et al. v. Federal Power Comm., 295 F.2d 109 (4th Cir.1961); El Paso Natural Gas Co. v. Federal Power Comm., 281 F.2d 567 (5th Cir.1960).</p>\n<p id=\"b715-9\">The Commission, \u201c[a]fter careful consideration of the various factors involved\u201d decided that a specific return of 1.5 per cent on the recovered funds, coupled with the other advantages derived from the use of liberalized depreciation, provides sufficient incentive for the continued use of liberalized depreciation. This conclusion was \u201clargely a matter of judgment based upon such factors as [the Commission\u2019s] knowledge of the money market, and [its] estimate as to what course most regulated companies will elect to pursue in the future.\u201d Since these evaluations are within the expert competence of the Commission, we do not disturb the conclusions derived from them.</p>\n<p id=\"b715-10\">Affirmed.</p>\n<footnote label=\"1\">\n<p id=\"b712-20\">. 15 U.S.C. \u00a7 717c (e).</p>\n</footnote>\n<footnote label=\"2\">\n<p id=\"b713-6\">. 26 U.S.C. \u00a7 167.</p>\n</footnote>\n<footnote label=\"3\">\n<p id=\"b713-11\">. 15 U.S.C. \u00a7 717d(a).</p>\n</footnote>\n<footnote label=\"4\">\n<p id=\"b714-5\">. Insofar as the opinion in City of Detroit, supra, indicates tliat the intent of Congress in the revenue act was to benefit taxpaying producers and not their consumers, we may regard it as limited to the circumstances of that case, where the petitioning consumer sought to have the amounts recovered as depreciation expense deducted entirely from the producer\u2019s rate base. We held that the Commission properly included such reserves in the rate base. The present case is distinguishable. Here the Commission seeks only to limit the rate of return on such reserves. And since the opinion in City of Detroit uses language broader than required for the decision on this aspect of the case, we are not constrained to read the case as deciding that in all circumstances and in the light of greater experience with the operation of \u00a7 167 the greatest possible benefit should inure to the producer and none at all permitted to the consumer. Furthermore, the additional advantages to the taxpaying producer in using accelerated depreciation urged in this case appear to be more substantial than those discussed in City of Detroit. See note 5, infra.</p>\n</footnote>\n<footnote label=\"5\">\n<p id=\"b714-9\">. The other \u201cmaterial advantages\u201d which the Commission found would result from \u201cthe use of deferred taxes to supply a portion of the company\u2019s capital requirements,\u201d are as follows:</p>\n<blockquote id=\"b714-10\">\u201cThe substantial sums involved are readily available without resort to the market, and such additions to capital serve to reduce the company\u2019s debt ratio. The acquisition of plant by use of deferred taxes provides additional security not subject to lien on which new loans can be based, perhaps at lower interest rates than would otherwise be possible. Furthermore, deferred tax funds accumulated between rate cases and invested in plant may, during that period, increase the company\u2019s earnings. Finally, the accumulation of deferred taxes increases the company\u2019s funds available for expansion without issuing additional common stock.\u201d</blockquote>\n</footnote>\n</opinion>\n<opinion data-order=\"14\" data-type=\"opinion\" id=\"x999-2\" type=\"dissent\">\n<author id=\"b715-11\">WILBUR K. MILLER, Circuit Judge, with whom DANAHER, BASTIAN and BURGER, Circuit Judges,</author>\n<p id=\"Amo\">join (dissenting).</p>\n<p id=\"b715-12\">The erroneous order now affirmed by the majority derived largely from two sources: (a) the mistaken notion that, as to industries regulated by it, the Commission has power to limit the effect of the plain mandate of Congress expressed in Sections 167 and 168,<footnotemark>1</footnotemark> and (b) the <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"664\">*664</page-number>Commission\u2019s refusal, contrary to its own precedents and in defiance of our City of Detroit opinion,<footnotemark>2</footnotemark> to recognize that the statutory accelerated amortization and liberalized depreciation are essentially bookkeeping entries for federal income tax purposes, in which the ratepayers have no interest. They stand apart from these transactions between the Government and the taxpaying pipeline company, and continue to pay rates based on straight-line depreciation throughout the useful life of depreciable facilities, no more and no less. Thus, to give the ratepayers the lion\u2019s share of accelerated amortization and liberalized depreciation during the earlier years of useful life without requiring them to bear a corresponding share in the disadvantages of the later years when there is no amortization and smaller depreciation, is to confer on them an unfair advantage which is directly contrary to what Congress commanded. It also unfairly takes from the pipeline company a portion of the total depreciation it is entitled to recover.</p>\n<p id=\"b716-4\">A statement of the case\u2019s background will place these points in proper perspective, and will serve to introduce my subsequent discussion of the majority opinion\u2019s infirmities. Such a statement follows.</p>\n<p id=\"b716-5\">In August, 1952, soon after the enactment of the accelerated amortization statute \u2014 Section 124A (now Section 168) \u2014Panhandle initiated a proceeding before the Commission for a declaratory order as to whether it would be allowed to retain the tax benefits which would result if it were to adopt accelerated amortization under that section. On December 4, 1953, after expanding the proceeding into a rule-making determination in which Panhandle participated, the Commission issued its Opinion No. 264, Treatment of Federal Income Taxes as Affected by Accelerated Amortization, 12 F.P.C. 369. It there announced the general rule that pipeline companies would be allowed to retain all the benefits resulting from accelerated amortization and that none of these benefits would be passed on to utility customers.</p>\n<p id=\"b716-8\">In the course of its opinion, the Commission said, at pages 370, 371 of 12 F.P.C.:</p>\n<blockquote id=\"b716-9\">\u201c * * * The former section 124 of the Code having been made applicable to certified emergency facilities constructed by utility companies, as well as others, and the new section 124A [now 168] having the same jurisdictional language and the same basic objectives, the new section, of course, is applicable to electric public utilities and natural gas companies and we have no alternative but to construe it so. In fact, no one who argued before us disputed this point.</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b716-10\">\u201cUnder the accelerated amortization provision of section 124A, any taxpayer who has received a certificate of necessity issued by the proper defense agency for the construction of an emergency facility may elect to take a deduction from gross income over a period of 60 months for the amortization of a specified percentage of the cost of such emergency facilities in lieu of equal annual deductions for exhaustion, wear and tear, and obsolescence during the estimated life of the facilities. Congress sought by this <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"665\">*665</page-number>accelerated amortization provision to encourage the construction with private capital of those facilities which were deemed of sufficient value to the national defense to warrant the issuance of a certificate of necessity.</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b717-4\">\u201cThus, the recipient of a certificate of necessity obtains substantial deductions against the net income for income tax purposes during each of the first 5 years, and much smaller deductions therefrom during the remainder of the norma} amortization period. If the income tax rates remained the same during the entire life of the facilities, the same amount of taxes ultimately would be paid under either accelerated or normal amortization. By the enactment of this law, Congress did not forgive the payment of any income taxes; it merely allowed payment of some of them to be deferred. This has the precise effect of a grant by our Government to a certificate holder of an interest-free loan.</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b717-5\">\u201cAlthough all parties concede that certificates of necessity issued to electric public utilities and natural gas companies are perfectly valid and lawful, it has been strenuously argued that this Commission should nullify them by reducing the rates of such companies during the 5-year period of rapid amortization and thereby pass on to the customers of such companies the money which otherwise would inure to these companies by reason of their being permitted to defer payment of a portion of their income taxes.</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b717-6\">\u201cThe answer to this contention is that Congress obviously did not intend to make cash donations to the particular persons who happen to be, during the 5-year period of accelerated amortization, the customers of the particular utilities which have received the certificates of necessity. Such a result would be inconsistent with the effort of Congress to aid our national defense.\u201d</blockquote>\n<p id=\"b717-8\">The Commission added, at page 373 of 12 F.P.C.:</p>\n<blockquote id=\"b717-9\">\u201cNot infrequently the depreciation methods allowed and recognized by a regulatory agency are not the same as those used by the utility for computing income taxes. We will recognize normal depreciation where a public utility or natural gas company has the privilege of accelerated amortization under section 124A [now 168] of the Internal Revenue Code. We will use all safeguards at our command to insure that the ratepayer [sic] is protected from bearing any burden greater than normal depreciation after the period of accelerated amortization has expired. * * *</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b717-11\">\u201c * * * [I]t is clear to us that Congress, by the enactment of this law, did not intend to make gifts to the customers of the public utilities and natural gas companies which received certificates * *</blockquote>\n<p id=\"b717-12\">Against that background, Panhandle elected to use accelerated amortization for federal income tax purposes and constructed new facilities with funds thereby accumulated.</p>\n<p id=\"b717-13\">On April 15, 1954, the Commission entered an order prescribing certain rates and charges for Panhandle. With respect to the latter\u2019s use of accelerated amortization, the Commission said.<footnotemark>3</footnotemark></p>\n<blockquote id=\"b717-14\"><em>\u201c </em>* * * We have computed the tax payments which would have been required without the accelerated amortization which Panhandle is permitted, and for the purposes of the rate schedules under study have considered that Panhandle will be allowed as operating expenses such normalized taxes. This does not allow Panhandle for rate purposes more than a fair return over the long period, but does recognize the grant by Congress of certain temporary <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"666\">*666</page-number>tax savings under Section 124A [168].\u201d</blockquote>\n<p id=\"b718-4\">Since Section 124A (168) was not intended to reduce but only to defer tax liability, the Commission further stated :<footnotemark>4</footnotemark></p>\n<blockquote id=\"AqSA\">\u201c * * * [T] he accruals for taxes in excess of those actually paid should logically be treated by Panhandle, not as free and unrestricted income, but earmarked to provide for the future meeting of such liability.\u201d</blockquote>\n<p id=\"b718-5\">The City of Detroit and County of Wayne, customers of Panhandle, petitioned this court for review of the order of April 15, 1954, on the ground, <em>inter alia, </em>that the Commission erred in \u201cnormalizing\u201d income tax expense as if amortization had not been accelerated. They contended that the saving effected by the accelerated amortization should inure, partly at least, to the benefit of consumers.</p>\n<p id=\"b718-6\">We held the Commission had correctly concluded \u201cthat the intent of Congress reflected in section 124A [168] is not to benefit consumers but rather the taxpayer in order to encourage construction of certain emergency types of facilities.\u201d <footnotemark>5</footnotemark> We added the following:<footnotemark>6</footnotemark></p>\n<blockquote id=\"b718-7\">\u201c * <em>* </em>* were the tax savings deducted from the rate base, the taxpayer here would not receive the intended benefit. The valuations upon which it is entitled to earn a fair rate of return would be decreased by the amount of the savings. In placing the savings at the disposal of Panhandle under the limitations specified, the Congressional intent is effectuated. The funds go into a reserve account for the payment of the deferred taxes to accrue after the five year amortization period. Though thus earmarked, the funds are available for income-producing purposes. Unless this is permitted, it is difficult to see how Panhandle could benefit substantially from section 124A [168]. This statute, unlike the Natural Gas Act itself, is not for consumer benefit. It has a different public policy and should be given effect as intended by Congress. Furthermore, the solution of the Commission does not result in higher rates to the consumer. It simply does not operate to reduce them. It aids Panhandle but neither aids nor harms petitioners. We think this is the result sought by Congress.\u201d</blockquote>\n<p id=\"b718-12\">As the opinion of this court thus recognized, the purpose of Congress in enacting the accelerated amortization statute was to encourage industry, including natural gas companies, to invest more capital in fixed assets and thereby to increase productivity and spur the national-economy. If the economic advantage arising out of the accelerated amortization is to be largely passed on to the ratepayers \u2014 which is the effect of the Commission\u2019s order \u2014 the purpose of Congress will be defeated as far as public utilities are concerned.</p>\n<p id=\"b718-13\">It will be observed that the City of Detroit case dealt only with accelerated amortization under what is now Section 168. With respect to Section 167, the Commission ruled in Amere Gas Utilities Co., et al., 15 F.P.C. 760, at 781 (1956), that liberalized depreciation should be accorded the same treatment as that given to accelerated amortization. It said, at pages 781-782:</p>\n<blockquote id=\"b718-14\">\u201cWe are in agreement with the decision of the presiding examiner. We can find no legal difference between the problem now before us and that which was presented to us by section 124A (now section 168) of the Internal Revenue Code, pertaining to 5-year amortization of defense facilities pursuant to a certificate issued by a defense agency of the United States. Therefore, what was said in our opinion No. 264 in docket No. R-126, and in our opinion <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"667\">*667</page-number>'No. 269 in Panhandle Eastern Pipe Line Co., docket No. G-1116, et al., and what was said by the United States Court of Appeals for the District of Columbia Circuit in City of Detroit v. Federal Power Commission, on December 15, 1955 ([97 U.S.App.D.C. 260], 230 F.2d 810), in which the Commission\u2019s treatment of accelerated depreciation [sic] in the Panhandle case was fully approved, <em>is completely controlling in this matter.</em></blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b719-4\">\u201cAdmittedly, section 167 of the Internal Revenue Code contains no \u25a0specific mandate to create a reserve account for the deferred taxes. Nevertheless, we know of no way to \u25a0effectuate the clear and obvious Congressional intent, except by doing so, just as we did in our two prior opinions above mentioned. The argument that the sums in the reserve account will rightfully belong to the rate payers, or that the rate payers will bear any burden they do not now bear, by reason of the creation \u2022of the reserve, is wholly erroneous, as was lucidly explained by the United States Court of Appeals for the District of Columbia, above cited:</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b719-5\">\u201c \u2018 * * * The funds go into a reserve account for the payment of the deferred taxes to accrue after the 5-year amortization period. Though thus earmarked, the funds .are available for income-producing purposes. Unless this is permitted, it is difficult to see how Panhandle could benefit substantially from section 124A [now 168]. This statute, unlike the Natural Gas Act itself, is not for consumer benefit. It has a different public policy and should be given effect as intended by Congress. Furthermore, the solution of the Commission does not result in higher rates to the consumer. It simply does not operate to reduce them. It aids Panhandle but neither aids nor harms petitioners. We think this is the result sought by Congress. * * * \u2019</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b719-7\">\u201cIt is clear that the charging of greater depreciation during the early life of property and the charging of less during the later life operates to create a deferral of income taxes. The fact that there may be continuing additions to plant, year by year, with the result that there will be a balance in the reserve account at all times in the foreseeable future, does not prove that there is no tax deferral. On the contrary, it proves that there is a continuing tax deferral so long as additional facilities are being installed. This is precisely what Congress intended.</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b719-8\"><em>\u25a0X </em>#\u25a0 <em>* </em># # #</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b719-9\"><em>\u201cWe cannot strike down an act of Congress if we think it unwise, or unnecessary to a particular industry, and enforce it only if it is in accord with our economic and regulatory philosophy. </em>It is undisputed that section 167 of the Internal Revenue Code does apply, and was intended to apply to regulated natural gas companies, such as the petitioners.\u201d (Emphasis added.)</blockquote>\n<p id=\"b719-10\">Thereafter, Panhandle elected to use liberalized depreciation for federal income tax purposes and decided to build numerous facilities with funds so derived. Through the two methods of tax deferral, Panhandle accumulated $11,076,954,<footnotemark>7</footnotemark> which the Commission, true to its promise in its Opinion No. 264 <footnotemark>8</footnotemark> required it to record in a special account entitled \u201cAccumulated Deferred Taxes on Income\u201d so it would be available to pay the larger taxes during the later years when little or no depreciation deduction for tax purposes could be taken. Thus, the ratepayers were assured that, throughout the useful life of the facili<page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"668\">*668</page-number>ties, they would contribute no more than the income taxes based on normal straight-line depreciation.</p>\n<p id=\"b720-3\">On September 28, 1960, while the present proceeding was pending before it, the Commission again decided, in Phillips Petroleum Co., 24 F.P.C. 537, that the benefits resulting from the use of accelerated amortization were intended for \u00cdnd should be retained by the taxpayer nd not passed on to its customers. There 'it rejected its staff\u2019s proposal to artificially treat the accrued taxes as though they were a part of the company\u2019s capitalization and allow a return thereon at less than the full over-all rate. The Commission said, at page 570:</p>\n<blockquote id=\"b720-5\">\u201cThere was no dispute about these figures, but the staff contended that Phillips\u2019 actual debt ratio and actual cost of debt should be adjusted to reflect as an interest-free loan an item of deferred Federal income tax liability in the amount of $19,162,-355, arising from the accelerated amortization provisions of Section 168 of the Internal Revenue Code. This would decrease Phillips\u2019 cost of debt to 2.76 percent. The examiner refused to make this adjustment, and we agree. <em>The accelerated amortization provisions were to benefit the taxpayer, not the consumers. </em>They represent an advantage bestowed by Congress to encourage the construction of emergency facilities, and <em>we are not authorized to take away this advantage. </em>City of Detroit v. F. P. C., [97 U.S.App.D.C. 260, 272,] 230 F.2d 810, 822 (CADC), certiorari denied [Panhandle Eastern Pipe Line Co. v. City of Detroit, Mich.] 352 U.S. 829 [77 S.Ct. 34, 1 L.Ed.2d 48]. * * * (Emphasis added.)</blockquote>\n<p id=\"b720-7\">On March 7, 1961, however, the Commission\u2019s decision in Northern Natural Gas Co., 25 F.P.C. 431, reversed its former position, which we had approved, and refused to follow the City of Detroit case. It said, at page 437:</p>\n<blockquote id=\"b720-10\">\u201cThe Panhandle (City of Detroit) case was' considered by us shortly after the enactment of Section 168. At that time, neither we nor the courts were fully aware of all of the consequences which would result if moneys in the deferred tax accounts were considered as belonging solely to the company. Thus, the statement in the above quotation from the City of Detroit case that to permit the company to use the funds for income-producing purposes would not result in higher rates to the consumer has on more careful consideration [by the Commission] been disclosed to be erroneous.\u201d</blockquote>\n<p id=\"b720-11\">The City of Detroit case was decided by the Commission on December 4, 1953, so it was not considered \u201cshortly after\u201d the enactment of Section 168, which was in 1950; and our opinion in the City of Detroit case was handed down in 1955. The Commission took the same position in its Phillips Petroleum decision on September 28, 1960. It appears, therefore, that after eight years of experience, the Commission must have been \u201cfully aware of all of the consequences which would result if moneys in the deferred tax accounts were considered as belonging solely to the company,\u201d when it wrote its Phillips Petroleum opinion on September 28, 1960. Yet, less than six months thereafter, the Commission wrote the Northern Natural opinion reversing the position it had consistently taken from December, 1953, to late September, 1960; and the majority now approve their change of heart \u201cin the light of greater experience with the operation of \u00a7 167.\u201d <footnotemark>9</footnotemark></p>\n<p id=\"b720-12\">As the Commission\u2019s initial ruling in December, 1953, was followed by it several times and as late as September 28, 1960, after eight years of experience <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"669\">*669</page-number>with the depreciation statutes, clearly the Commission\u2019s departure from it on March 7, 1961, was not due to greater experience with their operation. It was merely an abrupt change of mind. Moreover, this court has had no experience with this problem since the City of Detroit case, so I conclude the majority are acting on the erroneous impression that its change of view was justified by the Commission\u2019s fanciful \u201cgreater experience.\u201d</p>\n<p id=\"b721-4\">After saying in the above quotation that our City of Detroit opinion was erroneous, the Commission\u2019s Northern Natural decision continued thus, at page 439 of 25 F.P.C.:</p>\n<blockquote id=\"b721-5\">\u201cIn our view, <em>the best solution to this problem is to divide the benefits of liberalized depreciation between the regulated company and the ratepayer. </em>In dividing these benefits between the ratepayer and the company, we are guided by the principle that it is our duty to protect the consumer, and adopt ratemaking principles which will assure the lowest possible rates. Accordingly, we believe that the major portion of the benefits accruing from the use of liberalized depreciation should go to the ratepayer, and the company should be allowed only so much of the benefits accruing from the use of liberalized depreciation as is necessary to provide it with a sufficient incentive to continue to use liberalized depreciation, and not return to the use of straight-line depreciation in the computation of its income taxes. * * * \u201d (Emphasis added.)<footnotemark>10</footnotemark></blockquote>\n<p id=\"b721-7\">Chairman Kuykendall of the Commission dissented from the paragraph just quoted from the Northern Natural decision. After reproducing it, he said, at page 446 of 25 F.P.C.:</p>\n<blockquote id=\"b721-10\">\u201cIt is our duty to apply the law (that is section 167 of the Internal Revenue Code), and not our discretion, to the facts before us. We have only the legislative powers which Congress has given us, and have no power to amend section 167, distributing as we see fit the advantages given to the taxpayer by this statute.</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b721-11\">\u201cWe should, as the language of the Court of Appeals in the City of Detroit case, supra, quoted by the majority, clearly states, allow the taxpayer the full advantage of the tax deferral, but without any disadvantage to the ratepayer. The fact that the court did not mention, and may not, in fact, have considered the possible tax deduction arising by virtue of payment of interest on borrowed money does not alter the principle involved.</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b721-12\">\u201cMy colleagues seem to assume that the amounts accumulated through the deferral of taxes would otherwise be obtained through borrowing, or that, in any event such sums should be treated as the equivalent of debt capital. In my opinion, this is error. Such funds actually are as much or more akin to equity than to debt capital. We recognized this fact in our Order No. 203 amending our uniform system of accounts, 19 FPC 826, where we considered the possibility of setting up the reserve account as earmarked surplus. Our prohibition against payment of dividends from these funds would seem to presuppose that such sums are included in surplus.\u201d</blockquote>\n<p id=\"b721-13\">After distinguishing the El Paso case,<footnotemark>11</footnotemark> relied on by the majority of the Commission, by pointing out that the problem <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"670\">*670</page-number>there was whether liberalized depreciation constitutes a tax saving or a tax deferral, Chairman Kuykendall concluded by saying, at page 447 of 25 F.P.C.:</p>\n<blockquote id=\"AEO\">\u201cThe views I have expressed herein are, I believe, consistent with section 167 and its legislative history, with the only two court decisions which are controlling (City of Detroit and El Paso, supra), and are fair to the ratepayer; yet they do not constitute a usurpation of the constitutional power of Congress.\u201d</blockquote>\n<p id=\"b722-4\">In the El Paso case the Fifth Circuit discussed the treatment given by the Commission to the tax \u201csaving\u201d or deferral resulting from the use by the taxpayer of the declining balance method of depreciation of new equipment and said, at pages 573-574 of 281 F.2d:</p>\n<blockquote id=\"b722-5\">\u201c * * * In practical effect this works a tax deferral rather than a tax savings. If the company were charged for rate making purposes with such \u2018savings\u2019 during the year in which the depreciable assets were acquired, and the rate resulting from such treatment of the taxes was thereafter used for later years, as is here the ease, it is clear that the company would be paying higher taxes in subsequent years than in the test year, <em>but would not be entitled to cm adjustment in rates to cover the increase. </em>Therefore, we approve the Commission\u2019s treatment of the \u2018saving\u2019 resulting from using the declining balance method of depreciation for tax purposes but computing its taxes for rate making purposes on the staight line method of depreciation, placing such \u2018savings\u2019 in a special reserve to be used to equalize tax payments in later years. These amounts can never represent added return to the company because of the restriction as to their use.\u201d (Emphasis added.)</blockquote>\n<p id=\"b722-6\">The only restriction as to the use of the tax deferrals is that they may not be disbursed by way of dividend. They may be invested in facilities which become a part of the rate base just as any other equipment. When the Fifth Circuit said, \u201cThese amounts [tax deferrals] can never represent added return to the company [because they may not be paid out as dividends],\u201d it was of course not saying the company could not earn a fair return on the facilities in which \u201cthese amounts [the tax deferrals]\u201d are invested. For, if that were not permitted, a regulated company, forbidden by the Commission to distribute tax deferrals as dividends, could obtain no benefit whatever from Sections 167 and 168, and the Congressional intention to give it the sole benefit would be completely frustrated. That intention is proportionately defeated when, as here, a part of the benefit is taken away from the regulated company and given to its customers.</p>\n<p id=\"b722-8\">I come now to the proceeding in which the order presently under review was entered. On September 10, 1959, Panhandle filed with the Commission proposed increased rates including the usual rate of return upon the facilities acquired with tax accruals. As outlined above, this treatment of such accruals had been established for several years and was reaffirmed by the Commission on September 28, 1960, while Panhandle\u2019s proposal was pending. After hearings, the Commission abandoned the position previously taken in several cases and issued an order March 20, 1961, disallowing the proposed rates. It found proper a 6.25 per cent return on transmission facilities and said the finding was based, in part, upon its determination \u201cthat a factual statement of a pipeline company's capital should include the amounts accumulated in the restricted account for deferred taxes, and that a net return of 1.5 percent should be attributed to such amounts.\u201d <footnotemark>12</footnotemark></p>\n<p id=\"b722-9\">This was, of course, a division of the benefits of accelerated amortization and liberalized depreciation between the regulated company and its customers, which the Commission had said in the Northern <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"671\">*671</page-number>Natural case is the \u201cbest solution.\u201d In the City of Detroit case, however, the question whether the benefits resulting from accelerated amortization should be divided between the company and the ratepayers was presented, and was answered in the negative by the Commission and by this court.</p>\n<p id=\"b723-4\">From this it is clear that in answering the question differently in its Northern Natural opinion, the Commission deliberately refused to follow this court\u2019s City of Detroit holding which sustained its former position. It has done the same thing in the present case. In argument here, the Commission asserts and attempts to show that the order under review is \u201centirely consistent with\u201d our City of Detroit decision. Yet it says:</p>\n<blockquote id=\"AjLR\">\u201c * * * The breadth of some of the Court\u2019s language must be assumed to have resulted from the parties\u2019 and the Court\u2019s failure fully to anticipate the issue of the present case and thus fully to appreciate the potential future ramifications of the tax normalization treatment approved in City of Detroit.\u201d</blockquote>\n<p id=\"AB3\">and adds that:</p>\n<blockquote id=\"b723-5\">\u201c * * * [W]hile the decision in City of Detroit was sound, the opinion should be reexamined with a view to recognition of the <em>basically dynamic and fluid effect </em>of accelerated amortization and liberalized depreciation. * * * (Emphasis added.)</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b723-7\">***\u00ab\u2022\u25a0\u00bb*</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b723-8\">\u201c * * * The Court should make it clear that the law does not prohibit regulatory action which would allow ratepayers to participate in the benefit from a utility\u2019s use of accelerated amortization and liberalized depreciation for federal income tax purposes. * * * \u201d</blockquote>\n<p id=\"b723-9\">The majority opinion now declares the law to be as contended for by the Commission in the paragraph last quoted. I suggest this cannot be done without expressly overruling the City of Detroit case, which the majority have not done. Instead, they seek to distinguish it by saying,</p>\n<blockquote id=\"b723-12\">\u201c * * * But the question of what return, if any, should be allowed on reserve funds included in the rate base was not before us in City of Detroit. It is the sole question presented in this case.\u201d</blockquote>\n<p id=\"b723-14\">This is not an accurate statement of the tax deferral question presented in the City of Detroit case and in this case. In the former, the question was whether the benefits resulting from accelerated amortization should be divided between the pipeline company and its customers. As I have pointed out \u2014 and I repeat the quotation for emphasis \u2014 we answered the question in the negative by saying, 97 U.S.App.D.C. at 272, 230 F.2d at 822:</p>\n<blockquote id=\"AaW\">\u201c * * * [T]he Commission * * * concluded, we think correctly, that the intent of Congess reflected in section 124A [168] is not to benefit consumers but rather the taxpayer in order to encourage construction of certain emergency types of facilities. Were the tax savings deducted from the rate base, the taxpayer here would not receive the intended benefit. The valuations upon which it is entitled to earn a fair rate of return would be decreased by the amount of the savings. In placing the savings at the disposal of Panhandle under the limitations specified, the Congressional intent is effectuated. The funds go into a reserve account for the payment of the deferred taxes to accrue after the five year amortization period. Though thus earmarked, the funds are available for income-producing purposes. Unless this is permitted, it is difficult to see how Panhandle could benefit substantially from section 124A. This statute, unlike the Natural Gas Act itself, is not for consumer benefit. It has a different public policy and should be given effect as intended by Congress. Furthermore, the solution of the Commission does not result in higher rates to the consumer. It simply <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"672\">*672</page-number>does not operate to reduce them. It aids Panhandle but neither aids nor harms petitioners. We think this is the result sought by Congress.\u201d</blockquote>\n<p id=\"b724-4\">The question in this case is not, as the majority states, \u201cwhat return, if any, should be allowed on reserve funds included in the rate base.\u201d It is, rather, whether the Commission was correct in dividing the benefit resulting from accelerated amortization and liberalized depreciation between Panhandle and its customers in the face of our City of Detroit opinion. There can be no question that the Commission did exactly that. In the first place, it is obvious that the allowance of a return of 1.5 percent on facilities acquired with tax deferrals amounts to dividing the benefit between Panhandle and its customers. In the second place, the Commission said in its Northern Natural decision that it had decided \u201cto divide the benefits of liberalized depreciation between the regulated company and the ratepayer\u201d; as the order under review was based on the Commission\u2019s Northern Natural case, it is of course true that the restrictive return of 1.5 per cent was fixed in pursuance of the Commission\u2019s determination to divide the benefit between Panhandle and its customers.</p>\n<p id=\"b724-5\">This truth cannot be escaped by saying the question was merely \u201cwhat return, if any, should be allowed on reserve funds included in the rate base.\u201d By allowing a return of only 1.5 per cent on facilities acquired with tax deferrals, the Commission has in effect withdrawn a substantial portion of those facilities from Panhandle\u2019s rate base, and has given to the ratepayer a large part of the benefit of the tax deferral program which Congress intended to give to the taxpayer. As I have said, it is obvious that 1.5 per cent is not the full return which would have been allowed if the Commission had not decided to divide the benefit between Panhandle and the i-atepayers.</p>\n<p id=\"b724-6\">The majority opinion, in saying the \u201csole question\u201d in this case is \u201cwhat return, if any, should be allowed on reserve funds included in the rate base,\u201d rejects what both the Commission and Panhandle agreed was the issue. In a pre-hearing stipulation the parties agreed this question was presented:</p>\n<blockquote id=\"Ai4\">\u201cWas it error for the Federal Power Commission to allow a return of 1.5% on the portion of the rate base financed by funds representing the difference between the income taxes which Panhandle would have been required to pay without liberalized depreciation and accelerated amortization, as provided by Sections 167 and 168 of the Internal Revenue Code of 1954, and the taxes actually paid, which funds are recorded in restricted accounts entitled \u2018Accumulated Deferred Income Taxes\u2019?\u201d</blockquote>\n<p id=\"b724-8\">That is to say, was it error for the Commission to allow a return of 1.5 per cent on the portion of the rate base financed by tax deferrals and thus divide the benefit resulting from Sections 167 and 168 between Panhandle and its customers ? That is the true question here, and I suggest it was answered by our City of Detroit opinion.</p>\n<p id=\"b724-9\">In another attempt to distinguish this case from that one, the majority say in their footnote 4:</p>\n<blockquote id=\"b724-10\">\u201c * * * We held [in the City of Detroit case] that the Commission properly included such reserves in the rate base. The present case is distinguishable. Here the Commission seeks only to limit the rate of return of such reserves. * * * \u201d</blockquote>\n<p id=\"b724-11\">The statement from the City of Detroit opinion, which I have already quoted twice, was much more than a decision that the Commission properly included the tax reserves in the rate base. We affirmed the Commission\u2019s conclusion that the intent of Congress in Section 124A [168] was not to benefit consumers, as was explicitly recognized in the City of Detroit case, but to encourage all taxpayers, both regulated and unregulated, to modernize and expand their facilities. That conclusion was the basis of the Commission\u2019s rejection of Detroit\u2019s con<page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"673\">*673</page-number>tention that the benefit should go to Panhandle\u2019s customers or be divided with them \u2014 a rejection which we affirmed in unequivocal language because we recognized the Congressional intention to give all the benefit to the taxpaying company. But now the majority necessarily limit the plain language of the City of Detroit opinion in order to limit the operation of the statutes. In footnote 4, the majority not only attempt to distinguish that case, as I have said; they also brand its holding as dictum by saying it \u201cuses language broader than required for the decision on this aspect of the case.\u201d Because of this branding \u2014 or misbranding \u2014 the majority say:</p>\n<blockquote id=\"b725-4\">\u201c * * * [W] e are not constrained to read the case as deciding that in all circumstances and in the light of greater experience with the operation of \u00a7 167 the greatest possible benefit should inure to the producer [sic] and none at all permitted to the consumer. * * * \u201d</blockquote>\n<p id=\"b725-5\">They also say:</p>\n<blockquote id=\"b725-6\">\u201c * * * Nothing in the language or legislative history [of Section 167] indicates that Congress considered its regulatory consequences. * * * \u201d</blockquote>\n<p id=\"b725-8\">By the same token, nothing in the language or legislative history of Sections 167 and 168 indicates that Congress did <em>not </em>consider their regulatory consequences. Congress made those sections general in application, with their benefits available to regulated companies as well as unregulated businesses; this is beyond dispute. Indeed, it was admitted by the Commission in the Amere case, 15 F.P.C. at 782:</p>\n<blockquote id=\"b725-9\">\u00ab* * * js undisputed that section 167 of the Internal Revenue Code does apply, and was intended to apply to regulated natural gas companies, such as the petitioners.\u201d</blockquote>\n<p id=\"b725-10\">The majority err, I think, and go beyond their province when they say the sections, though general in language, do not apply literally to regulated companies because their language and legislative history do not show Congress considered their \u201cregulatory consequences.\u201d</p>\n<p id=\"b725-13\">Before the Commission changed its position, it said in its Amere opinion, supra at 782, of 15 F.P.C.:</p>\n<blockquote id=\"b725-14\">\u201c * * * The argument that the sums in the reserve account will rightfully belong to the rate payers, or that the rate payers will bear any burden they do not now bear, by reasons of the creation of the reserve, is wholly erroneous. * * * \u201d</blockquote>\n<p id=\"b725-15\">Then it added this significant language:</p>\n<blockquote id=\"ACfT\">\u201cWe cannot strike down an act of Congress if we think it unwise, or unnecessary to a particular industry, and enforce it only if it is in accord with our economic and regulatory philosophy. * * * \u201d</blockquote>\n<p id=\"b725-16\">Yet in the Northern Natural ease, and in the order in the present case, the Commission substantially amended Sections 167 and 168 by denying their full benefit to regulated companies. Its brief in this case says the City of Detroit case \u201cshould be reexamined with a view to recognition of the basically dynamic and fluid effect of accelerated amortization and liberalized depreciation.\u201d And the majority opinion supports that position by saying that Congress did not consider the regulatory consequences of Sections 167 and 168. This amounts to saying that Congress made a mistake in making those sections fully applicable to regulated natural gas companies \u2014 as it clearly and admittedly did \u2014 and that the Commission and this court have the right to amend the sections in accord with their \u201ceconomic and regulatory philosophy.\u2019'\" I cannot agree to either of these propositions.</p>\n<p id=\"b725-17\">The majority cannot escape the plain and simple fact that their action actually reduces the rates to the customers, because it gives them the benefit of the tax deferrals in the early years without requiring them to bear a corresponding burden in the later years. So, Sections 167 and 168 are transformed into rate-reducing provisions as to regulated companies, although the unregulated com<page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"674\">*674</page-number>pa\u00f1\u00edes enjoy the full benefit conferred by them. In this way, the Congessional enactments are amended by the majority, and the City of Detroit case is overridden, although not expressly overruled. It is sheer sophistry to pretend that the court is not overruling the City of Detroit case.</p>\n<p id=\"b726-4\">Congress intended in these sections, as the majority admit, to \u201cassist modernization and expansion of industrial capacity, with resulting economic growth, increased production, and a higher standard of living.\u201d It sought to accomplish that by offering to the taxpaying company accelerated amortization and liberalized depreciation. But the Commission and the majority of this court are saying that, with respect to regulated companies, this objective may be attained by offering to them only a small part of the advantages of accelerated amortization and liberalized depreciation\u2014 only as much as they think will encourage regulated companies to modernize and expand capacity.</p>\n<p id=\"b726-5\">My point here is that the Commission and the majority of this court do not have authority to decide that, although Congress offered unequivocally a definite benefit to encourage taxpayers to modernize and expand their facilities, the same result may be achieved by offering only a part \u2014 indeed, a small part \u2014 of the designated benefit to regulated companies. After all, it is for Panhandle, and not for the Commission and this court, to decide whether to take advantage of Sections 167 and 168. Panhandle had the right to say, as it did, that it would not elect to compute its income taxes under those sections unless it could retain the benefit accruing therefrom. But now the majority are holding that 1.5 per cent return on the facilities acquired by reliance on the Commission\u2019s assurances is enough to cause Panhandle to make the election. To me, this is patently beyond the power of the Commission and the court, and contrary to the clear language of the statutes.</p>\n<p id=\"b726-6\">The majority further say:</p>\n<blockquote id=\"b726-7\">\u201c * * * The Commission\u2019s decision does not disturb this acceleration; it relates only to the rate of return allowed a regulated company on the reinvestment of the money thus recovered. * * * \u201d</blockquote>\n<p id=\"b726-8\">In other words, they are saying to Panhandle, \u201cYou may still use the accelerated depreciation sections, but you may not derive therefrom the benefit Congress intended to confer thereby.\u201d This is worse than consoling a widow, when the dividends upon which she is dependent are passed, by saying to her, \u201cAfter all, you still have your stocks.\u201d The widow\u2019s dividends may be resumed, but Panhandle can never get more than a fraction of the benefit of the statutes.</p>\n<p id=\"b726-9\">In its footnote 5, the majority speaks of \u201cother material advantages\u201d which the Commission thought Panhandle will enjoy from being forced to share the benefits of the statutes with its customers. These \u201cother material advantages\u201d do not compensate Panhandle for the loss of a fair return on facilities acquired with tax deferrals.</p>\n<p id=\"b726-10\">In addition to what precedes, I suggest that the Commission\u2019s action in its Northern Natural case and in this case exceeded its authority. Its determination in an earlier Panhandle case, pursuant to a rule it had previously announced, that Section 168 confers benefits on the regulated companies and not on their customers, as a consequence of which it could not divide the benefits between them, was affirmed by our City of Detroit case. The present case involves the same parties, the same sort of facilities, and the same issues. It would seem that our prior decision should control. But the Commission, having thereafter decided it best \u201cto divide the benefits of liberalized depreciation between the regulated company and the ratepayer,\u201d for the second time rejected our City of Detroit case as erroneous, and gave a major portion of the benefits to Panhandle\u2019s customers.</p>\n<p id=\"b727-4\"><page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"675\">*675</page-number>A similar reversal of a prior administrative determination which had been judicially approved was forbidden by the Eighth Circuit in National Labor Relations Bd. v. Brown &amp; Root.<footnotemark>13</footnotemark> In an initial proceeding, the Labor Board treated two corporations as separate employers, and in the ensuing review the Eighth Circuit\u2019s decision was based upon its conclusion that the two companies were not a single employer. Despite this, the Board, in a second proceeding, held that the two corporations were a single employer. But the Eighth Circuit held that the question whether they were one employer or two employers was necessarily involved in the prior proceeding in which both the Board and the court treated them as two; that therefore the Board was precluded from holding in the later proceeding that they constituted a single employer. The court quoted the general rule on the conclusiveness of judgments which was thus stated in Henderson v. United States Radiator Corp.:<footnotemark>14</footnotemark></p>\n<blockquote id=\"b727-5\">\u201c * * * Any right, fact or matter in issue and directly adjudicated, or necessarily involved in the determination of an action before a competent court in which a judgment or decree has been rendered upon the merits, is conclusively settled by the judgment therein and cannot again be litigated between the same parties and their privies, whether the claim, demand, purpose or subject-matter of the two suits is the same or not.\u201d</blockquote>\n<p id=\"b727-6\">As has been shown, Panhandle sought, obtained and relied upon the Commission\u2019s determination <em>in a rule-making proceeding </em>that it would be permitted to retain the benefits of Sections 167 and 168, before electing to adopt the accelerated amortization and liberalized depreciation authorized therein. It made clear to the Commission it would not feel justified in making the elections without official assurance of full benefit therefrom. For the Commission, in any circumstances, to repudiate its assurances to Panhandle seems at least inequitable; to do it by presuming to overrule a decision of this court, is, I think, unconscionable. Why the majority aid and abet the Commission\u2019s act while asserting they are not repudiating the City of Detroit case is difficult to fathom.</p>\n<p id=\"b727-8\">For these reasons, it seems clear to me that the order under review is erroneous and should be reversed. Therefore, I dissent.</p>\n<footnote label=\"1\">\n<p id=\"b715-6\">. 26 U.S.C. \u00a7\u00a7 167 and 168. Section 168, providing for accelerated amortization, was originally enacted in 1950 as Section 124A. Section 167, the liberalized depreciation measure, was adopted in 1954.</p>\n<p id=\"AhJ\">Under <em>these </em>sections a company may elect to employ, in computing its income taxes, accelerated amortization or liberalized depreciation of certain facilities instead of normal straight-line depreciation. Obviously, this treatment of depreciation results in greater annual deductions therefor during the early years of the property\u2019s anticipated useful life than does the straight-line method, and so reduces the tax payments during those years. It is equally obvious that, after enhanced depreciation is taken during the early years, depreciation deductions during the later years will be correspondingly smaller, so that income tax payments will then be higher than if normal straight-line depreciation had been used for income tax purposes throughout the useful life.</p>\n<p id=\"AWN\">It is thus seen that accelerated amortization and liberalized depreciation produce only temporary tax savings: a portion of the tax payments which would be due in the early years under straight-line depreciation is merely deferred until <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"664\">*664</page-number>the later years. In the meantime, however, if the taxpayer is actually accumulating a reserve for income taxes based on straight-line depreciation, it has during the early years an excess of reserve over actual current payments which it can use for plant expansion or other investment purposes until it is needed to make the larger tax payments of the later years. This is the principal benefit Congress intended to confer on the taxpaying company by enacting Sections 167 and 168. It is plain, I think, that the payer of rates calculated on straight-line depreciation during the whole useful life is not affected by, and therefore has no interest in, these statutory provisions.</p>\n</footnote>\n<footnote label=\"2\">\n<p id=\"b716-12\">.

The majority speak only of Section 167, the liberalized depreciation provision, enacted in 1954. Section 168, dealing with accelerated amortization, was enacted in 1950. The principles governing the application of the two sections to regulated companies is admittedly the same. Both sections are involved here because Panhandle\u2019s tax reserves come from both sources. See footnote 7.</p>\n</footnote>\n<footnote label=\"10\">\n<p id=\"b721-8\">.
