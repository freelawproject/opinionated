Thereafter his conviction was affirmed by this court. Heinecke v. United States, 111 U.S.App.D.C. 98, 294 F.2d 727 (1961), cert. denied, 368 U.S. 901, 82 S.Ct. 173, 7 L.Ed.2d 96.</p>\n<p id=\"b738-16\">Appellant\u2019s primary claim for relief under 28 U.S.C. \u00a7 2255 is based on an alleged violation of due process of law resulting from the conduct of his trial. On the third day of his trial, appellant\u2019s co-defendant Womack entered a guilty plea. Thereafter the trial judge explained to the jury that the co-defendant Womack would not appear in the courtroom because his case had been disposed of. Appellant made no objection to the court\u2019s explanation of the disposition of Womack\u2019s case, did not move for a mistrial or move after conviction for a new trial on this ground. Nor did he raise the point on his direct appeal referred to above. The point was raised for the first time in his collateral attack on the sentence under \u00a7 2255, wherein he claims that the trial judge\u2019s explanation to the jury of the disposition of Womack's case was plain error, that inevitably the jury was bound to know Womack pleaded guilty and that because of such knowledge appellant was denied due process of law. He suggests but is unable to demonstrate record support, that the District Judge \u201cby his conduct made sure the jury knew what had happened.\u201d <footnotemark>1</footnotemark> We need not reach the issue whether the jury\u2019s knowledge of these <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"687\">*687</page-number>facts would constitute a denial of due process so as to warrant relief under \u00a7 2255, because the record does not support that contention. See Dauer v. United States, 204 F.2d 141 (10th Cir. 1953), cert. denied, 346 U.S. 889, 74 S.Ct. 141, 98 L.Ed. 393.</p>\n<p id=\"b739-4\">Appellant\u2019s second point is that the material found obscene at his trial could not be found obscene under a Supreme Court opinion<footnotemark>2</footnotemark> which intervened between conviction and this collateral motion. This allegation, even if supported by the record, affords no basis for relief under \u00a7 2255. Cf. Warring v. Colpoys, 74 App.D.C. 303, 122 F.2d 642, 136 A.L.R. 1025, cert. denied, 314 U.S. 678, 62 S.Ct. 184, 86 L.Ed. 543 (1941).</p>\n<p id=\"AACW\">Affirmed.</p>\n<footnote label=\"1\">\n<p id=\"b738-12\">. \u201cThe Court: Ladies and gentlemen of the jury, you may be wondering why there has been a cessation of proceedings for a little while and what has happened. While I shall not go into details because it is not necessary or desirable to do so, I think you should be informed, as you will observe, the defendant Womack is no longer in the courtz\u2019oom. The case as to him has been disposed of. From now on the case will go on only as to the co-defendant Alfred Heinecke, who you see seated at tbe couzzsel table with his counsel, Mr. Deitz.\u201d</p>\n<p id=\"AMs\">Izz Ms charge the Judge told the jury:</p>\n<p id=\"ATj\">\u201cThe indictment in this case names two defendants, Herman L. Womack and Alfred J. Heinecke. Alfred J. Heinecke is now on trial. After the trial started, the case involving Herman L. Womack was otherwise disposed of. The manner of the disposition of course, does not concern you. * * *\u201d</p>\n</footnote>\n<footnote label=\"2\">\n<p id=\"b739-20\">. Manual Enterprises, Inc. v.
