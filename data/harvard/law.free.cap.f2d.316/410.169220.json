Despite a long history of apparently harmonious labor relationships with the charging party, the petitioner was said to have discriminated against two employees named Compton and'Boone. One initially mishandled episode arising out of chance remarks on a Friday afternoon resulted: (1) in the, employer\u2019s imposing an improper condition for the retention of employment by Compton and Boone; and (2) almost as rapidly, overnight, in the employer\u2019s unconditional offer the next morning to reinstate the two men with full pay for the few hours\u2019 lost time. The men did not accept the offer. The Board\u2019s Decision and Order, 136 N.L.R.B. No. 30, observed that the Saturday offer was \u201cmade in good faith.\u201d</p>\n<p id=\"b463-22\">The employer renewed the offer of reinstatement on the following Monday. Again, Compton and Boone did not accept <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"412\">*412</page-number>and return to work with the afternoon shift. Notwithstanding, the Board ordered reinstatement with back pay. The principal issue \u2014 although there are others which will be mentioned \u2014 is whether or not the law requires that an employer at his peril must keep open his bona fide offer of reinstatement until the <em>union </em>decides whether or not the offer is to be accepted.</p>\n<p id=\"b464-4\">\n<em>Background</em>\n</p>\n<p id=\"b464-5\">The petitioner, White Sulphur Springs Company, at all times mentioned herein, operated the Greenbrier Hotel in the small town of White Sulphur Springs, West Virginia, and there employed about 1,000 persons. Since about 1948, most employees were represented by six unions, one of which was United Association of Journeymen Plumbers and Pipe-fitters and Apprentices of North America, Local Union 651, AFL-CIO, the charging party. The Local\u2019s business agent, Hunt, had headquarters at Charleston, West Virginia, about 125 miles from the Greenbrier Hotel. Local 651 had about 117 members scattered throughout various West Virginia counties, but only six such members were employed at the Greenbrier. The other 111 plumbers had no voice in contracts for the Greenbrier plumbers. Perhaps because of the distance factor, \u201cit was always the practice of the Union\u201d as the Trial Examiner found, for Hunt \u201cto let the six [or] seven plumbers employed by [the Greenbrier] decide under what terms and conditions they were to be employed.\u201d</p>\n<p id=\"b464-15\">The record, including Hunt\u2019s own testimony, overwhelmingly \u201cestablishes that the Union acquiesced in the local unit\u2019s [Greenbrier plumbers] negotiation of their own contract with [petitioner], and merely required it to notify Union headquarters [Hunt] of the results thereof by a letter of intent.<footnotemark>1</footnotemark> ******It was after this information was received and presumably with full knowledge of how accord was achieved, that the formal written contracts were signed by Union officials.\u201d <footnotemark>2</footnotemark> The Trial Examiner so found, and the record supports him.</p>\n<p id=\"b464-16\">\u201cUntil this [instant] proceeding was instituted,\u201d said the Trial Examiner in his Intermediate Report, \u201cnot a single voice was uttered in protest thereof by any union official, nor was there any suggestion that Respondent\u2019s meetings and negotiations with the men was in derogation of the Union\u2019s status as collective bargaining representative.\u201d</p>\n<p id=\"b465-4\"><page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"413\">*413</page-number>He concluded that the Local had authorized its White Sulphur Springs unit [the Greenbrier plumbers] to continue that practice in 1960, and that the petitioner\u2019s conduct in these last negotiations was not violative of the Act. The Trial Examiner knew there had been no labor dispute between the employer and the Greenbrier plumbers. They had not crossed the picket line after several hundred other workers went on strike June 23,1960. The Examiner knew that upon termination of the strike as of July 19th, the plumbers reported for work, including Compton at noon on July 20, and Boone at 8 A.M. on July 21. He knew that the plumbers then hoped to be accorded the. raise which had been granted to the others, such as the electrical workers.</p>\n<p id=\"b465-5\">The employer knew that since the 1959 contract with the plumbers had nearly a year to run, it was in no position to grant a unilateral increase. When the plumbers on July 21, 1960 sought the increase, the employer met with them and gave them their choice to be exercised <em>by noon </em>of July 25, either to continue under the 1959 contract, or to initiate steps to work out a new contract.</p>\n<p id=\"b465-6\">Against that background and in light of other details, the Trial Examiner appraised the evidentiary showing on the whole record made before him and summed up as follows:</p>\n<blockquote id=\"b465-7\">\u201cThough I am mindful of the well-established principle that where a collective bargaining representative of employees has been chosen by them, it is incumbent upon the employer to bargain with that representative and no other I am nevertheless convinced that, <em>under the circumstances existing here, </em>Respondent\u2019s conduct was not violative of \u25a0 the Act. (Emphasis in the original.)</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b465-11\">\u201cI find no evidence in this record that Respondent engaged in negotiations with the employees \u2018to the exclusion of the employees\u2019 collective bargaining representative,\u2019 as claimed by the General Counsel. Indeed, the letter of intent, the very document which occasioned this entire proceeding and upon which the General Counsel relies, was prepared for the plumbers by Respondent and states \u2018that a contract will be executed on their behalf between [the] Union\u2019 and Respondent.\u201d</blockquote>\n<p id=\"b465-12\">The sequence of events in the critical period, July 21-25, 1960, will later be developed. Importantly for the present, on Friday, July 22, the employer\u2019s chief engineer, Way, brought to the plumbers\u2019 shop the document prepared the previous day and now known as the letter of intent.<footnotemark>3</footnotemark> .</p>\n<p id=\"b465-13\">He had been informed that a majority of the men \u201cwere in favor of receiving the wage increases and other benefits.\u201d He placed the letter on a table with a copy of the proposed new contract, with changes marked in red so that the men might readily note new items. He left the documents with the men that the business might be discussed. When he later returned with the plumbers\u2019 foreman,. Walton, he found that four of the men had already signed the letter. Compton and Boone had not yet done so. Compton' uttered a critical comment. Way vented <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"414\">*414</page-number>what should have been taken as an irrelevant rejoinder. But as can happen, Compton ascribed to it greater importance. Thereafter an impasse developed from the erroneous emphasis accorded to the verbal exchange. As a result, Compton was presently to telephone Hunt in Charleston to report that the employer was then treating the contract as having been breached. The employer in fact had offered to enter into a new contract only if the men voted to do so. The alternative was open to them to continue under the 1959 contract \u2014 which they finally did. We can understand the employer\u2019s desire to get the hotel reopened, and that the work of the plumbers was essential, but Way never should have put pressure on Compton and Boone. It is clear that Way told Compton and Boone that unless they signed the letter, they could not work.</p>\n<p id=\"AmN\">That last circumstance created a violation of section 8(a) (1), and we so hold despite petitioner's claim to the contrary. As the record supports the findings and conclusions of the Examiner on this aspect of the case, such conduct by Way may be construed as restraining and coercing the plumbers in the exercise of their rights, protected both by their contract and by the Act.<footnotemark>4</footnotemark> The Board correctly so agreed. Medo Photo Supply Corp. v. National Labor Relations Board, 321 U.S. 678, 683, 684, 64 S.Ct. 830, 88 L.Ed. 1007 (1944); Lion Oil Company v. National Labor Relations Board, 245 F.2d 376 (8 Cir., 1957); D. H. Holmes Co. v. National Labor Relations Board, 179 F.2d 876, 879 (5 Cir., 1950).</p>\n<p id=\"b466-9\">As to the section 8(a) (3) and 8(a) (5) charges, the Board in its Decision and Order, noted that the \u201cfacts are accurately stated by the Trial Examiner,\u201d but it rejected his conclusions. We grant that the employer should not have threatened Compton and Boone with discharge.<footnotemark>5</footnotemark> We observe at once that the record supports the Examiner\u2019s finding that next day \u201cboth men were offered reinstatement and back pay on July 23, and were again offered reinstatement on July 25, both of which offers were rejected.\u201d He added: \u201cUnder these circumstances, I find no authority which authorizes me to require that Respondent repeat its offer to these two men.\u201d (See note 10 infra.)</p>\n<p id=\"b466-10\">\n<em>Issues</em>\n</p>\n<p id=\"b466-11\">Our issues really arise from the lack of substance to sustain the conclusions predicating the Board\u2019s order. Critical items of purported fact are not supported, as we shall develop. To the contrary, the entire record, in support of the Examiner, shows that the employer\u2019s offers, both on Saturday, July 23,<footnotemark>6</footnotemark> and Monday, July 25,1960, were unequivocal and without condition of any kind. Even were we to say that technically, the Friday discharge was discriminatory and so violated section 8(a) (3), that factor here presents no real issue. The employer moved promptly to dissipate the effect of the mistaken action of its employee Way. The Board\u2019s Decision expressly set forth that since the Saturday offer was \u201cmade in good faith, we shall not hold [the employer] liable for back pay from Saturday, July 23 * *</p>\n<p id=\"b467-4\"><page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"415\">*415</page-number>The law required the employer to do no more than it did on Saturday morning. Hunt by telephone Saturday morning told 'Murphy, a former shop steward, that he and the other three men were to go back to work provided they did so under the \u201cold contract\u201d and that Compton and Boone were reinstated with back pay. Murphy so advised the employer, and he and the other plumbers accordingly went back to work, abandoned the letter of intent, and the employer by 11 A.M. notified both Compton and Boone to report for the afternoon shift, with back pay for their lost time. The record does not support a conclusion that the Friday discrimination thereafter continued.</p>\n<p id=\"b467-5\">Confronted with such a record, the Board in its Decision said that a section 8(a) (3) violation occurred because the employer held open its offer of reinstatement for \u201can unreasonably <footnotemark>7</footnotemark> short time.\u201d The Board\u2019s language may be interpreted to mean, as Board counsel orally argued, that the bona fide offer of reinstatement to Compton and Boone must as a matter of right be held open until their <em>union </em>might decide whether or not the unconditional offer was to be accepted. We find no language in the Act for that proposition and no authority which has so reasoned, whether with respect to the Saturday offer, the Monday offer, or the employer\u2019s final refusal to reinstate after acceptance had come too late. From the beginning, Monday noon had been fixed as the deadline for decision. The employer certainly was entitled to know where it stood, especially when the whole situation had evolved in the first place from the desire of the plumbers to secure a raise</p>\n<p id=\"b467-6\">The record thus sustains the Examiner. It is barren of evidence that the employer was guilty of unlawful discrimination where it promptly offered to reinstate Compton and Boone and to reimburse them for the time lost. That is particularly true since the Board, as it did, was bound to recognize and concede the employer\u2019s good faith in seeking to make amends.</p>\n<p id=\"b467-10\">The remaining issue has to do with the Board\u2019s conclusion that section 8(a) (5) was violated in that the employer dealt \u201cdirectly with the employees in the bargaining unit.\u201d Of course, in one sense, it did so, but under circumstances we have already noted and <em>not </em>to the exclusion of the Union. The Board recognized, as the Examiner had made abundantly clear, that these six Green-brier plumbers, their Local and its business agent in dealing with this employer, had established what the Examiner had called a \u201cpattern of conduct,\u201d satisfactory to all parties. Yet, it was \u201cdifferent\u201d this time, said the Board, because the employer \u201cwas seeking to <em>modify </em>the [presently outstanding] agreement by presenting the business agent with a <em>contract </em>already approved by the employees, without his intervention or representation.\u201d (Emphasis added.) The record taken as a whole does not sustain the Board.</p>\n<p id=\"b467-11\">First, there was no such 1960 \u201ccontract.\u201d No party was bound. The Board itself said the employer was seeking to \u201cmodify\u201d the 1959 agreement, obviously recognizing it was still in force. No such 1960 \u201ccontract\u201d was thereafter consummated, and the men who remained on the job continued to work under the 1959-1961 agreement. What was signed by four of the men was a letter, which expressly and in so many words contemplated \u201cthat <em>a contract will be executed on their behalf between the said Local Union and the said White Sulphur Springs </em>Company.\u201d The device of utiliz<page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"416\">*416</page-number>ing such a writing previously had been created, the record shows, not by the Company, but by the Local\u2019s business agent, Hunt, and for his information.</p>\n<p id=\"b468-4\">Next, the Board recited in its reconstruction of the situation that the employer\u2019s chief engineer \u201cexplained to the six plumbers that if they signed the letter of intent indicating approval of the new contract, the Employer would put the new wage provisions into effect.\u201d We have scoured the transcript without finding a line of evidence to sustain the Board\u2019s finding to any such effect. There is nothing to show that the letter in 1960, as in 1958 and 1959, had or was intended to have any greater purpose than to indicate to the business agent Hunt the basis upon which a new contract was to be evolved.<footnotemark>8</footnotemark></p>\n<p id=\"b468-5\">In any such situation involving what Compton called \u201cbusiness,\u201d Hunt, the business agent, either in person or by mail, had procured over the years a canvass of the men. He then relied upon and followed the majority position upon receipt of advices as to what it was. Hunt testified that when he \u201cmet with the [Greenbrier] men, they would give me permission to open it or tell me what they wanted.\u201d Thus in February, 1959, he acted \u201cto open the contract provision pertaining to wages.\u201d So in 1960, the plumbers voted <em>not </em>to reopen the 1959-1961 contract, and Compton sent word to Hunt they would \u201cleave her like she is, the majority said, and if Mr. Wright gives anybody a raise, he will give us all .a raise.\u201d Again, as recently as July, 1959, Hunt acted in accordance with the letter of intent, supra note 2, pursuant to which he \u201csigned the contract.\u201d \u201cQ. Did you do that because a majority of the men in the local unit at the hotel had indicated they wanted this contract signed? A. I would say yes.\u201d \u201cQ. Did you ever complain of the fact that the men had signed this letter of intent? [supra note 2] A. Not to my knowledge.\u201d</p>\n<p id=\"b468-9\">The record simply does not sustain the Board\u2019s findings in the mentioned respects upon which it rested its conclusions. There was no suggestion at any time by the employer that it would unilaterally \u2014 and without negotiation with Hunt \u2014 grant wage increases, or otherwise reject the 1959-1961 contract. Called as a witness by the General Counsel, the employer\u2019s general manager Wright, was corroborated by Compton and Boone. Wright\u2019s exact testimony ran thus:</p>\n<blockquote id=\"b468-10\">\u201cQ. By [General Counsel] Did you tell the six plumber employees that they could receive wage increases and other benefits given to the other hotel employees represented by the labor organizations other than the charging party if the plumbers so desired? A. If they so desired and negotiated a new contract through their Business Agent.</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b468-11\">\u201cQ. Did you tell the plumber employees that if they chose to receive the new wages and the benefits that a new collective bargaining agreement would have to be had between the hotel company and the charging party ? A. Yes, sir.</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b468-12\">\u201cQ. Did you tell the six plumber employees that they always had a choice of working under the terms and conditions of their contract which was effective June 16, 1959, which is General Counsel\u2019s Exhibit No. 2? A. Yes, sir.\u201d</blockquote>\n<p id=\"b468-13\">The plumbers were given the period July 21-July 25 within which to make their own decision. Except for that Friday afternoon\u2019s mischanced episode, there would be nothing whatever to this case,<footnotemark>9</footnotemark> and such \u201cdiscrimination\u201d or other un<page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"417\">*417</page-number>toward result as might be attributed to that circumstance, was cured by the employer\u2019s bona fide offer to reinstate Compton and Boone with pay for the time they had lost. It might even have been concluded that the employer so acted- \u2014 not in derogation of the Local\u2019s position under the 1959-1961 agreement \u2014 but because of it. Hunt told Murphy and the latter told his superiors, the plumbers were to go back to work Saturday morning under the \u201cold\u201d contract, provided Compton and Boone were reinstated with back pay. The offer followed.</p>\n<p id=\"b469-5\">\n<em>Conclusion</em>\n</p>\n<p id=\"b469-6\">Since the Board\u2019s action had here been challenged as shown, it devolved upon us to review the whole record. That we have done with scrupulous care. A reviewing court is not \u201cbarred from setting aside a Board decision when it cannot conscientiously find that the evidence supporting that decision is substantial, when viewed in the light that the record in its entirety furnishes, including the body of evidence opposed to the Board\u2019s view.\u201d Universal Camera Corp. v. National Labor Relations Board, 340 U.S. 474, 488, 71 S.Ct. 456, 464, 95 L.Ed. 456 (1951); cf. United Wholesale, etc., Emp., etc. v. N. L. R. B., 108 U.S.App.D.C. 341, 282 F.2d 824 (1960).</p>\n<p id=\"b469-7\">Neither on the law nor on the evidence, taking the record as a whole, can we sustain the Board with reference to the issues we have outlined. We are persuaded that the Board erred in ordering the reinstatement<footnotemark>10</footnotemark> of Compton and Boone.</p>\n<p id=\"b469-8\">Additionally we have concluded that taking into consideration all aspects of the relationships between this employer and its unions representing many hundreds of employees, and particularly the long-pursued course of dealings with Local 651, the Examiner correctly evaluated the over-all problem.<footnotemark>11</footnotemark></p>\n<p id=\"b469-12\">The Board\u2019s order will be modified in conformity with this opinion and, as modified, will be enforced.</p>\n<footnote label=\"1\">\n<p id=\"b464-6\">.

In June, 1959, the Greenbrier plumbers after a three day walk-out, returned to work without a contract. When the employer later sought to formalize their status, Hunt himself requested during a long distance telephone conference, that he be given advices from the men by letter. The personnel manager then called the men, informed them of Hunt\u2019s desire, and Boone and all the other plumbers except Compton signed the following letter:</p>\n<p id=\"AbAf\">\u201cMr. J. L.

On July 21, 1960, the Company\u2019s vice president told the plumbers that they could secure increases only if they would accept contracts similar to those that had been concluded with the other unions. In the alternative, they could continue work under their old contract, then in force. Compton, who was shop steward and one of the two employees soon to be discharged, called the Union\u2019s business agent, who expressed the view that the contract then in effect could not be changed at that point. The next morning, a Friday, the Company\u2019s chief engineer \u2014 -Way-\u2014brought a \u201cletter of intent\u201d and a new contract to the plumbing shop and explained what the letter, which indicated approval of the new contract, <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"418\">*418</page-number>\u201cwas supposed to do.\u201d While the record fails to elucidate the meaning or details of Way\u2019s statement, it is clear that the men understood that they could not have the wage increase unless they signed the letter. Four of the six men in the shop signed but Compton and Boone refused, relying on the advice of the Union\u2019s business agent. Later in the day, Way returned and informed Compton and Boone that if they did not sign the letter of intent they \u201ccould not work.\u201d No work was assigned to the men for the rest of the day.</p>\n<p id=\"b470-4\">The next morning Way called Compton at his home and instructed him and Boone to report for work at 12:30 p. m'. Way stated that the men would be given back pay for the work they had missed. Compton expressed confusion and told Way that he would like to talk to the business agent before deciding whether to follow the order to report to work. He called the business agent but was unable to reach him over the weekend. Way called again on Monday morning at 11 a. m. and told Compton that he and Boone must return to work by 12:30 that day. Compton told Way that he had not yet reached the business agent and that he was still confused about what to do in view of the business agent\u2019s instruction the previous Friday to wait until he heard from him before taking any action. The men did not report to work at 12:30, but Compton did call Way at 2.30 that afternoon, immediately after he had spoken to the business agent and been told by the latter that everything was straightened out and that they should go back to work. Way told him, however, that he and Boone could not return to work because of their failure to comply with the 12:30 deadline.</p>\n<p id=\"b470-5\">All of the findings set forth above were \u2014-in my view \u2014 clearly supported by substantial evidence. On the basis thereof, the Board concluded that the Company had violated Sections 8(a) (1), 8(a) (3), and 8(a) (5), and ordered that the men be reinstated with back pay. The majority opinion, as I understand it, enforces only that part of the Board\u2019s order finding a violation of Section 8(a) (1). I would enforce the order in its entirety.</p>\n<p id=\"b470-7\">There is little question in my mind that the Company, by telling Compton and Boone on Friday that they must sign the letter of intent or they could not work, and then refusing to assign work to them when they would not comply with that demand, violated the prohibition of Section 8(a) (3). If there were any doubt on this score, the Company\u2019s conduct on Monday certainly removed it. In light of Compton\u2019s position that he had been instructed by the Union not to sign, the Company\u2019s action clearly tended to discourage union membership within the meaning of the Act. See National Labor Relations Board v. Ra-Rich Mfg. Corp., 276 F.2d 451, 454 (2d Cir., 1960).</p>\n<p id=\"b470-8\">With respect to the alleged violation of Section 8(a) (5), the Board\u2019s decision stated:</p>\n<blockquote id=\"b470-9\">\u201c3. We also conclude that the Respondent violated Section 8(a) (5) by its demand that Compton and Boone sign the letter of intent and by attempting to deal directly with the employees in the bargaining unit, without notice to the Union and without regard for its right to act as their representative.\u201d</blockquote>\n<p id=\"b470-10\">It seems to me to be beyond dispute that the coercive actions of the Company violated Section 8(a) (5), since they bore an immediate relation to the effort to obtain approval of proposed contractual modifications. Merely because they also amounted to a violation of Sections 8(a) (1) and 8(a) (3) does not render them irrelevant to the Section 8(a) (5) determination. Moreover, I cannot separate the Company\u2019s submission of the letter of intent from its coercive effort to obtain unanimous approval of the letter from the employees in the bargaining unit. Whatever practices the Union may reasonably be thought to have acquiesced in, I cannot reach the conclusion, on the basis of the record before us, that it acquiesced in the course of conduct pursued by the <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"419\">*419</page-number>Company in this instance. Consequently, I think the Board\u2019s finding that-the Company violated Section 8(a) (5) should be affirmed.</p>\n<p id=\"b471-4\">The remaining question for decision is, as I view the case, whether the Board exceeded its power in ordering reinstatement as a remedy for these violations. The source of the Board\u2019s authority to order reinstatement with or without back pay is Section 10(c) of the Act, which reads, in relevant part, \u201cIf upon the preponderance of the testimony taken the Board shall be of the opinion that any person named in the complaint has engaged in or is engaging in any such unfair labor practice, then the Board shall state its findings of fact and shall issue -x- * * an order requiring such person to cease and desist from such unfair labor practice, and to take such affirmative action including reinstatement of employees with or without back pay, <em>as will effectuate the policies of this Act </em>* (Emphasis supplied.) This language is clearly designed to give the Board the widest latitude in its selection of remedies once it has duly found that an unfair labor practice has been committed. See National Labor Relations Board v. Seven-Up Bottling Co., 344 U.S. 344, 346, 73 S.Ct. 287, 97 L.Ed. 377 (1953); Virginia Electric &amp; Power Co. v. National Labor Relations Board, 319 U.S. 533, 63 S.Ct. 1214, 87 L.Ed. 1568 (1943). In the Virginia Electric &amp; Power Company case the Court stated that the Board\u2019s choice of remedy \u201cshould stand unless it can be shown that the order is a patent attempt to achieve ends other than those which can fairly be said to effectuate the policies of the Act.\u201d Id., at 540, 63 S.Ct. at 1218. The majority opinion does not specifically conclude that the order of reinstatement with back pay in this case was \u201ca patent attempt to achieve ends other than those which can fairly be said to effectuate the policies of the Act,\u201d and I think such a conclusion could not be justified on this record. I would accordingly uphold that portion of the Board\u2019s order, and in fact the order as a whole.</p>\n</opinion>\n</casebody>\n",
