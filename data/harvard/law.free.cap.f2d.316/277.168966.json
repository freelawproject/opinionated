Since he lived and had his headquarters in Pittsburgh, defendant had the option under its contract of transferring plaintiff to Youngstown and requiring him to pay his own expenses there or it could leave his headquarters in Pittsburgh and pay his expenses at Youngstown. Defendant chose the latter course and arranged for plaintiff and his gang to stay at the \u201crailroad \u2018Y\u2019 \u201d at Campbell. Plaintiff lived there during the week, eating two meals a day at its restaurant and taking out a lunch supplied by the \u201cY\u201d. He went home to Pittsburgh on weekends. This routine was followed for several months prior to May 3, 1957, the date of the accident.</p>\n<p id=\"b330-12\">Initially, we are faced with the question of whether Carney was covered by the provisions of the Federal Employers\u2019 Liability Act at the time he fell: was he \u201cemployed\u201d within the meaning of \u00a7 51.<footnotemark>1</footnotemark> Very nearly on all fours on the point is the case of Mostyn v. Delaware, L. &amp; W. R. R., 160 F.2d 15 (2 Cir., 1947). Mostyn involved a track worker who was housed and fed in a \u201cbunk car\u201d by a third party that was under contract with the railroad. Because of the verminous condition of his bunk plaintiff took his blankets and slept outside near the track, where he was subsequently struck by a passing train. The opinion-indicates that although the plaintiff Mostyn was privileged to sleep in the-bunk car (at his own expense), he could' also, if he wished, have slept in other accommodations available in the town. Although the contention of the railroad that plaintiff had quit his job prior to-the accident was not accepted, apparently he was not \u201con call\u201d. The court held, that the function of housing and feeding the plaintiff under these circumstances was one of those activities \u201cwhich,, though literally not part of the work, are-necessary to its performance\u201d and stated, 160 F.2d at 17-18:</p>\n<blockquote id=\"b330-13\">\u201cIt seems to us that when a railroad provides shelter or food or both for its employees, and they are using the accommodations so provided to prepare themselves for their work, or to-rest and recuperate, they must be regarded as in its \u2018employ\u2019 \u201d.</blockquote>\n<p id=\"b330-14\">We later approved of the principles laid\u2019 down in Mostyn in Casso v. Pennsylvania R. R. 219 F.2d 303 (3 Cir., 1955), where plaintiff was hit by a passing train while-walking back to his bunk house from a. day off.</p>\n<p id=\"b330-15\">The facts here are, in some respects,, stronger than those in Mostyn and Casso. Plaintiff\u2019s expenses at the Y.M.C.A. were-billed directly to defendant and paid on a. monthly basis. There was conflicting testimony as to whether plaintiff, in the pe-<page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"279\">*279</page-number>riod prior to his accident, was free to live in other accommodations having rates similar to those of the \u201cY\u201d and be reimbursed therefor by the railroad. Apparently at oral argument before the district court on its motion for judgment n. o. v. defendant conceded that it would not have paid or reimbursed plaintiff for his living expenses unless he stayed at the \u201cY\u201d. In any event, we have the essential common elements of Mostyn and Casso in that defendant provided plaintiff with shelter and food, which by custom and the economic realities of the situation he and his work group were encouraged to use. The case clearly comes within the framework of Mostyn and is in harmony with those decisions which have found related activities to be \u201cnecessarily incident\u201d to one\u2019s employment.<footnotemark>2</footnotemark></p>\n<p id=\"b331-4\">Our second problem is whether the trial court correctly ruled under the facts that the \u201c * * * defendant was responsible for any negligence in the maintenance of the facilities which resulted in the injuries sustained by plaintiff in this case.\u201d The railroad had sent Carney and seven other of its communication linemen specially from Pittsburgh to Campbell, Ohio for the purpose of \u201c * * * putting a new job down there, a big job.\u201d Carney\u2019s particular work was \u201cstringing cable.\u201d The task was intended to last for some period of time; \u201cthis wasn\u2019t a temporary job\u201d. As the trial judge stated in his opinion: \u201cAlthough defendant could have transferred plaintiff to Youngstown and required him to pay his own expenses it decided that plaintiff\u2019s station should remain at Pittsburgh and that it would pay plaintiff\u2019s living expenses while working on the project away from his station. Defendant made arrangements for plaintiff and his fellow linemen to stay at the Pittsburgh &amp; Lake Erie Railroad Y.M.C.A. at Campbell, Ohio. Plaintiff and other members of his gang slept at the Y.M.C.A. during the work-week, ate two meals a day at its restaur\u00e1nt, and had their lunch packed by Y.M.C.A. employees. Although about 97% -98% of the men who used these facilities paid for them all charges for plaintiff\u2019s room and board were billed directly to and paid for by defendant on a monthly basis. At oral argument on its motion, defendant conceded that it would not have paid for or reimbursed plaintiff for his living expenses unless he stayed at the Y.M.C.A. Plaintiff\u2019s daily working hours were from 8:00 A.M. to 4:30 P.M. and he was not \u2018on call\u2019 at other times.\u201d</p>\n<p id=\"b331-6\">The situation regarding the Y.M.C.A. and its relationship to the railroad need not be detailed. Regarding this the district court stated \u201cUnder these circumstances it cannot be disputed that defendant had some measure of control over the operation and maintenance of Y.M.C.A. facilities, whether or not it chose to exercise it.\u201d There is a lot to be said for this position but we prefer to base our decision primarily upon the proposition that plaintiff\u2019s residence and lodging at the Y.M.C.A. was part of the operational activities of the railroad; that the Y.M. C.A. in supplying those services to plaintiff by arrangement with the railroad, was performing operational activities of plaintiff\u2019s employer and in that capacity was an agent for the employer in accordance with Section 1 of the Employers\u2019 Liability Act. (45 U.S.C.A. \u00a7 51). Carney, when he fell, was in his room at the Y.M.C.A. where he was staying. He was there under the specific agreement with his employer that he would retain his out of town status and that the railroad would pay for his living expenses. As we have seen under the settled Mostyn, Casso principle, Carney was in the course of his employment when he was hurt. And under Sinkler v. Missouri Pacific R. R., 356 U.S. 326, 78 S.Ct. 758, 2 L.Ed.2d 799 (1958) the negligence of the Y.M. C.A. (found by the jury responsible in whole or part for the accident) was the negligence of its principal, the defendant <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"280\">*280</page-number>railroad. In Sinkler the plaintiff was an employee of the defendant Missouri Pacific Railroad. He was working on one of the latter\u2019s cars while it was being switched by a crew of the Belt Railway in the Union Station at Houston, Texas. The ear collided with another car in the station through the fault of the switching crew and plaintiff was injured. The switching railroad was organized by the Missouri Pacific and other rail carriers running into Union Station. They owned the Railway\u2019s stock and were represented on the Board of Directors in proportion to their holdings. Missouri Pacific owned half the stock and designated one-half of the directors. The Railway received some income from non stockholding carriers but the carrier stockholders otherwise shared the net expense of its operations according to an agreed formula. The Railway employed its own switching crews and other personnel and owned and operated the facilities and rolling stock used in the switching operations. The Supreme Court held, 356 U.S. 331-332, 78 S.Ct. 762-763:</p>\n<blockquote id=\"b332-4\">\u201cIn the present case the respondent, rather than doing the necessary switching incident to its business in the Houston Terminal area, arranged that the Belt Railway should supply the crews and equipment to perform this operation on its behalf. But the evidence clearly establishes that the respondent\u2019s trains, when under the control of the Belt Railway\u2019s switching crews, were being handled to further the task of the respondent\u2019s enterprise. While engaged in switching and handling respondent\u2019s cars and trains about the terminal area, the Belt Railway employees on the job were, for purposes of the FELA, as much a part of the respondent\u2019s total enterprise as was the petitioner while engaged in his regular work on the respondent\u2019s car.</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b332-5\">\u201cIt is manifest that the corporate autonomy of the Belt Railway, and its freedom from detailed supervision of its operations by respondent are irrelevant inasmuch as the switching crew of the Belt' Railway Company at the moment of the collision in the station was engaged in furthering the operational activities of respondent. We therefore hold that when a railroad employee\u2019s injury is caused in whole or in part by the fault of others performing, under contract, operational activities of his employer, such others are \u2018agents\u2019 of the employer within the meaning of \u00a7 1 of FELA.\u201d</blockquote>\n<p id=\"b332-7\">Ward v. Atlantic Coast Line R. Co., 362 U.S. 396, 80 S.Ct. 789, 4 L.Ed.2d 820 (1960) reaffirmed the Sinkler doctrine. There the plaintiff was employed by the railroad as a laborer in a section gang with a regular work week from Monday through Friday. On a Saturday, his day off, he with others of his gang worked for a customer of the railroad, a private concern, repairing the railroad siding into its property. The customer was bound to make the repairs at its own expense under its agreement with the railroad. Through the gang foreman, it hired the gang at overtime wages which the foreman paid the men with funds supplied him by the customer. Plaintiff was hurt during the work. The Supreme Court held pages 397, 398, 80 S.Ct. 790, 791:</p>\n<blockquote id=\"AIQ\">\u201cThis was not a situation, as in Sinkler, in which the railroad engaged an independent contractor to perform operational activities required to carry out the franchise. This was a siding privately owned by the Turpentine Company and established to service it alone. In maintaining it, we do not see how it can be said under the proofs that the Turpentine Company was \u2018engaged in furthering the operational activities of respondent.\u2019 \u201d</blockquote>\n<p id=\"b332-8\">Baker v. Texas &amp; P. R. Co., 359 U.S. 227, 229, 79 S.Ct. 664, 665, 3 L.Ed.2d 756 (1959) indicates strongly that in the kind of situation before us where the employment relationship at the time of the accident was controverted \u201cAn issue for determination by the jury was presented. \u2018The very essence of * * * [the jury\u2019s] function is to select from <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"281\">*281</page-number>among conflicting inferences and conclusions that which it considers most reasonable Tennant v. Peoria &amp; Pekin Union R. Co., 321 U.S. 29, 35 [64 S.Ct. 409, 88 L.Ed. 520].\u201d</p>\n<p id=\"b333-4\">Leek v. B. &amp; O. R. Co., 200 F.Supp. 368 (N.D.W.Va. 1962) is the latest reported decision we have found which follows Sinkler. It presents a close factual parallel to this appeal. Employees of the B. &amp; O. railroad, after completion of their day\u2019s work as a switching crew were being transported in a taxicab from where they had been employed to the railroad yard twelve miles away. That transportation was part of a shuttle arrangement between the railroad and the cab company for which the latter was paid by the railroad on a monthly arrangement. During the trip the taxicab went off the road, struck a pole and overturned. Plaintiff was injured. The accident occurred through the fault of the cab driver. Regarding the operational activity point involved the court held pages 370, 371:</p>\n<blockquote id=\"Asm\">\u201cCertainly, there must be many services performed by others under contract with a railroad, which are incidental or even necessary to the corporate purposes of the railroad, which are not \u2018operational activities\u2019 within the meaning of those words as employed in the Sinkler case. Just where the line should be drawn, I am neither prepared nor called upon to specify. However, I do not believe that the line should be drawn short of the activities which the taxicab company was performing for the railroad in this case.</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b333-5\">******</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b333-10\">\u201cThe obligation of the railroad to its employees created by the F.E.L.A. is imposed (in the words of the opinion in the Sinkler case), \u2018not because the employer is himself to blame, but because justice demands that one who gives his labor to the furtherance of the enterprise should be assured that all combining their exertions with him in the common pursuit will conduct themselves in all respects with sufficient care that his safety while doing his part will not be endangered.\u2019 One may quarrel with the congressional policy, as found and determined by the Supreme Court, in shifting the burden of economic loss caused, in whole or in part, by the negligence of someone acting in furtherance of the railroad\u2019s enterprise, from the individual to the enterprise, but the trend of the Court\u2019s decisions is too clear for this district court to disregard it.\u201d <footnotemark>3</footnotemark></blockquote>\n<p id=\"AG_\">What we have here is that the lodging of Carney at the railroad Y.M.C.A. was an integral part of the Pittsburgh &amp; Lake Erie\u2019s particular and important project in the vicinity. By that means the railroad made sure that Carney was on location and readily available during the period of the Campbell undertaking. The railroad handled Carney\u2019s board and lodging through the Y.M.C.A. \u201c * * * to further the task of [its] enterprise.\u201d And it was just as much a part of that enterprise as when Carney was actually stringing cable, for it put him in Campbell and kept him there to do that phase of the work. What he did was no separate engagement of the Y.M.C.A. as was the situation regarding the Turpentine Com-<page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"282\">*282</page-number>party in Ward, supra. In this instance it was solely Pittsburgh &amp; Lake Brie construction, alterations or repairs which were involved and for which his employer wanted Carney to be and remain at the scene. That objective under the facts was fully as much a part of the Campbell project as was the transportation of employees to and from their job in Leek, supra.</p>\n<p id=\"b334-4\">Even under common law there is substantial authority, as the Supreme Court states in Sinkler, supra at 329, 78 S.Ct. at 761, which \u201c * * * supported recovery by the railroad employee from his employer for injuries caused by the fault of employees of an independent contractor performing a part of the employer\u2019s railroad operations.\u201d But as that opinion firmly holds there is no need of relying on those principles where, as in this suit, we are governed by the F.E.L.A. whose \u201c * * * broad purpose controls our decision in determining whether the Belt Railway and its switching crew were \u2018agents\u2019 of the respondent within the meaning of the section. Plainly an accommodating scope must be given to the word \u2018agents\u2019 to give vitality to the standard governing the liability of carriers to their workers injured on the job.\u201d Pp. 330, 331, 78 S.Ct. p. 762.</p>\n<p id=\"b334-5\">From all of the above, in our view, the service the Y.M.C.A. performed for the railroad in taking care of Carney was part of the Pittsburgh &amp; Lake Erie\u2019s operational activities and therefore the Y. M.C.A. is to be treated in this instance as the agent of the railroad within the meaning of the F.E.L.A.</p>\n<p id=\"b334-6\">Appellant also contends that the release given by plaintiff to defendant is a bar to his action. There is no need of discussing this point at any length. We agree completely with the district court that the document did not apply to the injuries sustained in the accident of May 3, 1957 (the one before us) and that plaintiff\u2019s acceptance of further medical treatment for his earlier hernial condition after he had executed said release did not ratify it so as to include within it the accident before us.</p>\n<p id=\"b334-11\">The judgment of the district court will be affirmed.</p>\n<footnote label=\"1\">\n<p id=\"b330-10\">.

New York Central R. Co., 148 F.2d 575, 577 (6 Cir., 1945), regarding this type of litigation, \u201cEach case must be decided on its peculiar facts and ordinarily no one feature of the relationship is determinative.\u201d</p>\n</footnote>\n</opinion>\n<opinion data-order=\"10\" data-type=\"opinion\" id=\"x999-2\" type=\"dissent\">\n<author id=\"b334-13\">HASTIE, Circuit Judge</author>\n<p id=\"AEJ\">(dissenting).</p>\n<p id=\"Aja\">Essential to the majority decision is the conclusion that a Young Men\u2019s Christian Association, in furnishing lodging to employees of the defendant railroad, acted as an \u201cagent\u201d of the railroad within the meaning of section 1 of the F.E.L.A.<footnotemark>1</footnotemark> Otherwise, the railroad could not be held liable for negligence of the Y.M.C.A. in improperly making up the bed from which plaintiff fell in his sleep.<footnotemark>2</footnotemark> I am unable to agree that the Y.M.C.A. was the railroad\u2019s \u201cagent\u201d, as that term is used in the controlling statute.</p>\n<p id=\"AkzP\">The leading case is Sinkler v. Missouri Pacific R. R. Co., 1958, 356 U.S. 326, 78 S.Ct. 758, 2 L.Ed.2d 799, rehearing denied, 356 U.S. 978, 78 S.Ct. 1133, 2 L.Ed. 2d 1152. There the Supreme Court held that section 1 of the F.E.L.A. has created a statutory conception of agency broad enough to include \u201cothers performing, under contract, operational activities\u201d of the railroad. 356 U.S. at 331, 78 S.Ct. at 762. The key phrase is \u201coperational activities\u201d. The Court viewed the statute as \u201ca response to the special needs of railroad workers who are daily exposed to the risks inherent in railroad work and are helpless to provide adequately for their own safety.\u201d 356 U.S. at 329, 78 S.Ct. at 761. The phrase \u201coperational activities\u201d seems to have been used by the Court to describe the area within which these <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"283\">*283</page-number>\u2022characteristic \u201crisks inherent in railroad work\u201d are experienced. Under this rationale, the switching of the defendant\u2019s \u2022car at a railroad station, which the negligent third person was performing in the Sinkler case, was obviously an \u201coperational activity\u201d of the defendant\u2019s railroading. By the same token, the providing of sleeping accommodations for off-duty railroad men seems to be the type \u25a0of collateral activity which may facilitate railroading but is not \u201coperational\u201d in character.</p>\n<p id=\"b335-4\">This has been made clearer by the more precise articulation in Ward v. Atlantic Coast Line R. R. Co., 1960, 362 U.S. 396, 80 S.Ct. 789, 4 L.Ed.2d 820, where a third person maintaining a privately owned siding was held not to be engaged in an \u25a0\u201coperational activity\u201d of the railroad and, hence, not to be an agent of the railroad within the meaning of the statute. In Ward, the Court added significant words to the key phrase, limiting the special agency concept to independent contractors performing \u201coperational activities required to carry out the franchise\u201d of the railroad. 362 U.S. at 397, 80 S.Ct. at 790. Actually, this very phrase was used by Mr. Justice Brennan in Sinkler to describe a common-law extension of vicarious liability which exists in some jurisdictions. It is evident from the illustrative cases cited therein that the Court understood that extension as being limited to the actual movement of cars and freight and maintenance of operating equipment.<footnotemark>3</footnotemark> The language used in Ward makes explicit that the Sinkler doctrine is no broader than this limited common-law extension of respondeat superior. We recognized the restrictive effect of the Ward case in Mazzucola v. Pennsylvania R. R. Co., 3d Cir.,1960, 281 F.2d 267, 270 n. 4. Accord, Garrett v. Southern Ry. Co., E.D.Tenn.1959, 173 F.Supp. 915, 918-919, aff\u2019d, 6th Cir.,1960, 278 F.2d 424, cert. denied, 364 U.S. 833, 81 S.Ct. 49, 5 L.Ed.2d 59. Any contrary intimation in Leek v. Baltimore &amp; O. R. R. Co., N.D.W.Va.1962, 200 F.Supp. 368, upon which the majority rely, is, in my judgment, unwarranted. I can find no rationale under which the Y.M.C.A. supplying hotel accommodations can be brought within the conception of a contractor performing an \u201coperational activity\u201d of the railroad, \u201crequired to carry out the franchise\u201d.</p>\n<p id=\"b335-12\">The majority opinion lays some stress upon the character of the injured employee\u2019s activity and the fact that the railroad paid the cost of the employee\u2019s lodging. But it is the negligent third person who must have been performing an operational activity of the carrier in order to impose' liability on the railroad. The nature of the injured workman\u2019s activity and the railroad\u2019s willingness to pay for his overnight accommodations both go to an entirely separate problem: whether, within the meaning of the F.E.L.A., the workman was \u201cemployed\u201d at the time of his injury.</p>\n<p id=\"b335-13\">Apart from concepts peculiar to the F.E.L.A., I think it clear that the so-called \u201crailroad\u201d Y.M.C.A. was not a common-law agent of the defendant railroad. They were separate corporations performing distinct functions. This \u201cY\u201d was one of more that 100 similar units organized in various parts of the country by the national Y.M.C.A. to provide lodging and recreational, religious and educational activities for railroad workers <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"284\">*284</page-number>away from home. The railroad had no authority over the Y.M.C.A. It did not select or appoint the directors or the employees of the Y.M.C.A. It did not supervise or interfere with \u201cY\u201d activities. True, since the Y.M.C.A. served railroad men primarily, the local \u201cY\u201d directors were railroad employees. But they were not policy making officers of the railroad and there is no indication whatever that the railroad influenced their decisions as Y.M.C.A. board members in any way.</p>\n<p id=\"b336-4\">The only other connection of the railroad with the Y.M.C.A. took the form of substantial donations of money and facilities. But a large donor to such a benevolent organization as a Y.M.C.A. is not for that reason related to the donee as a principal is to an agent. Here again there is no evidence that the railroad used its position as a donor as a means of exercising any control over the Y.M.C.A.</p>\n<p id=\"b336-5\">For these reasons I think this court and the court below have erred in holding the railroad responsible for the way in which the Y.M.C.A. made up its beds.
