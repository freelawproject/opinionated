The suit was brought by a medical doctor on appellee\u2019s group health and accident insurance policy, issued to members of the Oklahoma Medical Association. Under Part II, the policy pertinently provides for the payment of $600 per month for total disability due to accident, when the injury \u201cwholly and continuously disables and prevents the insured from performing each and every duty pertaining to his occupation * * * not to exceed 60 consecutive months.\u201d And, thereafter, \u201cso long as the insured lives and is wholly and continuously disabled * * * from engaging in each and every gainful oc-. cupation for which he is reasonably fitted * * Under Part III, the policy pertinently provides for the same monthly indemnity, due to sickness, while. \u201cwholly and continuously\u201d disabled from performing the duties of his occupation, provided that no indemnity under this part is payable for disability beyond the insured\u2019s seventy-second birthday.</p>\n<p id=\"b58-11\">Appellant alleges that an accidental injury has rendered him wholly and continuously disabled within the terms of the policy; that the appellee has paid him thereunder, at the rate of $600 per month, totaling $10,200, for total and continuous disability; and, that the Company has since tendered payments of $600 per month, totaling $6,000, but has endorsed on the cheeks, \u201cPayment under Part III\u201d of the policy, i. e., monthly sickness indemnity \u2014 under which payments will terminate at the expiration of three years. He specifically alleges \u201ctotal and permanent disability\u201d and claims monthly indemnity under Part II of the policy for the period of his life expectancy, calculated to be $106,128.</p>\n<p id=\"b58-13\">If, of course, the declaration on the policy is properly for the sum of $106,128, the requisite amount in controversy is present. And, the Court\u2019s jurisdiction is usually measured by the averments of the complaint, but as the declaration is necessarily on the policy, its pertinent provisions must govern appellant\u2019s right to recovery under applicable Oklahoma law, and the jurisdictional amount in controversy must be governed accordingly. For, a suit which is not maintainable for the jurisdictional amount <em>in the </em>Oklahoma courts cannot be maintained in the federal court. Henderson v. National Fidelity Life Insurance Co., 10 Cir., 257 F.2d 917.</p>\n<p id=\"b58-14\">In the first place, the policy does not provide indemnity for total and permanent disability, but only for monthly payments so long as the insured is wholly and continuously disabled. But even so, this is not a case for declaration of non-liability for invalidity, justifying \u201ctotal damages for total breach\u201d measured by the present value of the contract. See: Pacific Mut. Life Ins. Co. of California v. Parker, et ux, 4 Cir., 71 F.2d 872; Bell v. Philadelphia Life Ins. Co., 4 Cir., 78 F.2d 322; Mutual Benefit Health &amp; Accident Ass\u2019n v. Fortenberry, 5 Cir., 98 F.2d 570; and Guardian Life Ins. Co. of America v. Kortz, 10 Cir., 151 F.2d 582. And see also: N. Y. Life Ins. Co. v. Viglas, 297 U.S. 672, 56 S.Ct. 615, 80 L.Ed. 971; and Henderson v. National Fidelity Life Ins. Co., supra. Our contract simply provides for the payment of a stipulated monthly indemnity, contingent upon continuous total disability. <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"7\">*7</page-number>Our actual controversy turns on a construction of the policy, which conditions the Company\u2019s liability, depending upon whether the tendered benefits are payable under Part II (accident) or Part III (sickness).</p>\n<p id=\"b59-5\">The appellant would aggregate the $10,200 already paid and accepted by him, and the $6,000 tendered but not accepted by him, to make up the jurisdictional amount, but the $10,200 has been unconditionally paid and accepted by the complainant, apparently under Part II of the policy, and in any event, is not in controversy. The question whether the tendered $6,000 is applicable to complainant\u2019s disability under Part II or Part III of the contract does, indeed, present a justiciable controversy for declaratory relief. But, whether the insured or the insurer is the suitor, the controversy does not involve in excess of the accrued amount. If the declaration should be for the plaintiff-appellant, the amount of his recovery would be limited to the accrued monthly payments. See: Mutual Life Ins. Co. of New York v. Moyle, 4 Cir., 116 F.2d 434; and Mid-Continent Life Ins. Co. v. Christian, 164 Okl. 161, 23 P.2d 672.</p>\n<p id=\"b59-6\">The judgment is affirmed.</p>\n</opinion>\n</casebody>\n",
