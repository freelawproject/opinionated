Waters and Isabel P. Waters, to the Veterans Administration of the United <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"303\">*303</page-number>States of America, for the proceeds of said policy of insurance, pursuant to the terms thereof, but the Veterans Administration of the United States of America denied said claim and refused to pay such proceeds as demanded unless and until your petitioner agreed to file proceedings in court specifically authorizing her to receive such funds, and to conserve such funds and refrain from expending any part thereof without prior approval of the Veterans Administration, and to refrain from intermingling such funds with other funds of said minors, and to file an annual accounting of such proceeds with the Veterans Administration, and to present said minors in person at the office of the Veterans Administration for observation annually, upon request, all of which said requirements of the Veterans Administration were made improperly and without authority.\u201d</blockquote>\n<p id=\"b355-5\">The United States moved to dismiss on the following grounds:</p>\n<blockquote id=\"b355-6\">\u201c1. The Court lacks jurisdiction in that there has been no 'disagreement\u2019 or denial of plaintiff\u2019s claim.</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b355-7\">\u201c2. The Consent to Suit Statute (38 U.S.C. 784) makes such a disagreement or denial of claim a prerequisite to a suit on a National Service Life Insurance policy.\u201d</blockquote>\n<p id=\"b355-8\">After hearing argument of counsel the district court rendered a memorandum opinion from which it concluded: \u201cThe dispute in this matter falls short of being a disagreement as defined by the statute, and absent such disagreement, this Court is without jurisdiction.\u201d</p>\n<p id=\"b355-9\">The court accordingly dismissed the action for lack of jurisdiction.</p>\n<p id=\"b355-10\">The complaint must contain \u201ca short and plain statement of the grounds upon'which the court\u2019s jurisdiction depends.\u201d Rule 8(a) (1), Federal Rules of Civil Procedure. \u201cWhenever the question of jurisdiction of the federal District Court is presented it will be presumed that the court is without jurisdiction unless the contrary affirmatively appears.\u201d Le Mieux Bros. v. Tremont Lumber Co., 5 Cir., 1944, 140 F.2d 387, 389.</p>\n<p id=\"b355-12\">We agree with the plaintiff that a fair reading of the complaint shows that the plaintiff\u2019s claim has been considered on its merits by the Veterans\u2019 Administration, and payment has been denied unless plaintiff agrees to the requirements set forth in the complaint. We agree further that the imposition of unlawful and unauthorized requirements as a condition precedent to payment of a claim amounts to a denial of the claim. Compare Shaull v. United States, 1947, 82 U.S.App.D.C. 174, 161 F.2d 891, 894.</p>\n<p id=\"b355-13\">As authority for the requirements, the defendant relies on certain rules and regulations appearing in Part 13 of Chapter 1 of Title 38 of the Code of Federal Regulations \u201cissued under 72 Stat. 1114, 38 U.S.C. 210.\u201d That statute vests broad rule-making power in the Administrator of Veterans\u2019 Affairs:</p>\n<blockquote id=\"b355-14\">\u201c(c) The Administrator has authority to make all rules and regulations which are necessary or appropriate to carry out the laws administered by the Veterans\u2019 Administration and are consistent therewith, including regulations with respect to the nature and extent of proofs and evidence and the method of taking and furnishing them in order to establish the right to <em>benefits </em>under such laws, the forms of application by claimants under such laws, the methods of making investigations and medical examinations, and the manner and form of adjudications and awards.\u201d (Emphasis supplied.)</blockquote>\n<p id=\"b355-15\">The regulations referred to were issued \u201cto implement 38 U.S.C. 3202, 3203 and 3311, as amended by Public Laws 86-146 and 86-211,\u201d Sec. 13.1. Only 38 U.S.C. \u00a7 3202 is pertinent here. That section gives the Administrator broad discretion as to payments to and supervision of guardians in cases \u201cwhere any payment of <em>benefits </em>under any law administered by the Veterans' Admin<page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"304\">*304</page-number>istration is to be made to a minor.\u201d (Emphasis supplied.) The plaintiff insists that the use of the word \u201cbenefits\u201d in section 3202 denotes gratuitous payments rather than payments under contractual obligation. We do not agree that \u201cbenefits\u201d is so limited. Indeed, the entire National Service Life Insurance Act is codified under Title 38 of the United States Code, which is broadly captioned \u201cVeterans\u2019 Benefits.\u201d See 38 U.S. C.A. \u00a7 701 et seq. With particular reference to \u201cbenefits\u201d to minors, 38 U.S. C.A. \u00a7 783 provides:</p>\n<blockquote id=\"b356-4\">\u201c\u00a7 783. <em>Settlements for minors or incompetents</em></blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b356-5\">\u201cWhen an optional mode of settlement of National Service Life Insurance or United States Government life insurance heretofore or hereafter matured is available to a <em>beneficiary </em>who is a minor or incompetent, such option may be exercised by his fiduciary, person qualified under section 14 of title 25, or person recognized by the Administrator as having custody of the person or the estate of such <em>beneficiary, </em>and the obligation of the United States under the insurance contract shall be fully satisfied by payment of <em>benefits </em>in accordance with the mode of settlement so selected.\u201d (Emphasis supplied.)</blockquote>\n<p id=\"b356-6\">It will be observed that the statute vesting rule-making power in the Administrator uses the word \u201cbenefits\u201d in its broad sense. 38 U.S.C.A. \u00a7 210(c), quoted supra.</p>\n<p id=\"b356-7\">It further appears from the predecessor statutes, 38 U.S.C.A. \u00a7 450, 1952 edition, and 38 U.S.C.A. \u00a7 816, 1952 edition, as well as from the present 38 U.S.C.A. \u00a7 788, that the supervisory authority of the Administrator over payments of benefits to minors includes supervision over the payment of National Service Life Insurance.</p>\n<p id=\"b356-8\">The requirements of the Veterans\u2019 Administration as set out in the complaint appear to be authorized by 38 C.F.R. Part 13, and particularly by sections 13.59(b) (6) and (7), 13.101, 13.104 and 13.106. It would unduly prolong this opinion to quote extensively from those regulations.</p>\n<p id=\"b356-10\">We conclude that the complaint shows that the requirements imposed upon the claimant were lawful, and hence fails to show \u201ca denial of the claim.\u201d 38 U.S.C.A. \u00a7 784(h).</p>\n<p id=\"b356-11\">The judgment is therefore Affirmed.</p>\n</opinion>\n</casebody>\n",
