In March 1961, on petition of the National Labor Relations Board\u2019s Regional Director, the District Court for the Southern District of New York issued a preliminary injunction against the Union under 29 U.S.C. \u00a7 160 (\u00cd). Kaynard for and on behalf of N. L. R. B. v. New York Mailers Union, D.C., 191 F.Supp. 880. In March 1962, the Board ordered the Union (a) to cease inducing \u201cany individual employed by any person engaged in * * * an industry affecting commerce, including employees of\u201d the three newspapers, to refuse to use or handle \u201cmaterials or products * * * with an object of forcing or requiring any person,\u201d including the three newspapers, to cease doing business with Neo-Gravure or to cease handling its products, \u201cor with an object of forcing or requiring Neo-Gravure\u201d to \u201crecognize or bargain with\u201d the Union unless it \u201chas been certified as the representative of such employees\u201d; and (b) to cease \u201cThreatening, coercing, or restraining any person * * * in an industry affecting commerce,\u201d including the three newspapers, \u201cwith an object of having them cease doing business with Neo-Gravure * * * or to cease handling or otherwise dealing in the products of Neo-Gravure * * * or with an object of forcing or requiring Neo-Gravure * * * to recognize or bargain with\u201d the Union unless \u201ccertified as the representative of such employees\u201d. In support of the order, the Board found that the Union had violated the corresponding provisions of \u00a7\u00a7 8(b) (4) (i) (B) and 8 (b) (4) (ii) (B) of the National Labor Relations Act as amended, 73 Stat. 542 (1959), 29 U.S.C., Supp. III, \u00a7 158.136 NLRB No. 19.</p>\n<p id=\"b424-9\">The Union asks us to set aside the Board\u2019s order and the Board asks us to enforce it. Most of the facts are undisputed.</p>\n<p id=\"b424-10\">The Union\u2019s \u201cobject\u201d may be inferred from its acts. Local 761, Electrical Workers v. National Labor Relations Board, 366 U.S. 667, 674, 81 S.Ct. 1285, 6 L.Ed.2d 592 (1961). Cf. Los Angeles Mailers Union v. National Labor Relations Board, 114 U.S.App.D.C. -, 311 F.2d 121 (1962). The Union urges that \u00a7 8(b) (4) of the Act impliedly excepts refusals to handle \u201cstruck work\u201d. But the cited legislative history shows at most an intent to preserve an \u201cexception\u201d regarding <em>farmed-out </em>struck work. Such work is not strictly an exception. Farming-out extends the primary situs to the second employer. In the present case, the Neo-Gravure plant continued to be the only primary situs. The Act intends to confine labor disputes to their primary situs. Cf. Local 1976, Carpenters Union v. National Labor Relations Board, 357 U.S. 93, 100, 78 S.Ct. 1011, 2 L.Ed.2d 1186 (1958). The newspapers are secondary or neutral employers. It is immaterial that the same union represents employees of both the primary and the secondary employers, National Labor Relations Board v. Highway Truckdrivers, 300 F.2d 317 (3d Cir., 1962); that the union\u2019s contract says it need not handle struck work, Local 1976, Carpenters Union v. National Labor Relations Board, supra; and that other employees are available to handle the work, Los Angeles Mailers Union v. National Labor Relations Board, supra.</p>\n<p id=\"b425-3\"><page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"373\">*373</page-number>Though the Board did not find that the Union had violated the Act as against any employer except the three newspapers, it ordered the Union, within stated limits, to cease violations directed against \u201cany person engaged in * * * an industry affecting commerce * * * \u201d \u201cWe think the order should be modified * * * to correspond to the violations actually found to have been committed.\u201d United Steelworkers of America, AFL-CIO v. National Labor Relations Board, 111 U.S.App.D.C. 60, 64, 294 F.2d 256, 260 (1961). Communications Workers of America v. National Labor Relations Board, 362 U.S. 479, 480, 80 S.Ct. 838, 4 L.Ed.2d 896 (1960). As modified, the order will be enforced.</p>\n<p id=\"b425-4\">So ordered.</p>\n</opinion>\n</casebody>\n",
