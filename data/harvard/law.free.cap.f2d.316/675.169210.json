Jeffords appeal from an order of the United States District Court holding a Probate Court which granted appellee\u2019s motion to withdraw as counsel for the executors, ordered judgment for $10,000 in his favor and against the estate for services rendered, and \u201cauthorized and directed\u201d the executors to pay this judgment.</p>\n<p id=\"b728-20\">We think the court erred. D.C. Code \u00a7 20-605 (Fifth), which authorizes executors to pay attorneys\u2019 fees and the probate court to allow such fees in the executors\u2019 accounts, does not authorize the probate court to order executors to pay the fees.<footnotemark>1</footnotemark> An attorney may have a claim against the executors or the estate which he can collect in an action at law in the District Court. Brandenburg v. Dante, 49 App.D.C. 141, 261 F. 1021 (1919). But \u201cIt is settled in this District that the probate court is without jurisdiction to compel an executor or administrator to pay a claim asserted against a decedent\u2019s estate.\u201d Miniggio v. Hutchins, 43 App.D.C. 117, 119 (1915). The general rule has long been to the same effect. 1 Woerner: American Law of Administration \u00a7 152 (2d ed. 1899), 2 id., \u00a7 356; cf. 3d ed. (1923); 34 C.J.S. Executors and Administrators \u00a7 446a. The probate court\u2019s approval, however expressed, of a claim against the estate, is in legal effect an order that the claim will pass when paid. The order relieves the executor or administrator of liability if he elects to pay the claim. \u201cIn no case shall the order made by the probate court that an account or claim will pass when paid be deemed of validity to establish such claim or account; but in case the executor or administrator thinks fit to contest the same such account or claim shall derive no validity from the order aforesaid, but shall be proved in the same manner as if no such order had been made.\u201d D.C.Code \u00a7 18-517. If the executor or administrator contests the <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"677\">*677</page-number>claim, the probate court\u2019s order approving it is \u201cdeprived of even evidential effect.\u201d Miniggio v. Hutchins, supra.</p>\n<p id=\"b729-4\">The judgment is vacated and the cause remanded to the probate court with directions to delete the word \u201cdirected\u201d from its order or take other action consistent with this opinion.</p>\n<p id=\"b729-5\">Judgment vacated and cause remanded.</p>\n<footnote label=\"1\">\n<p id=\"b728-18\">. Hutchins v. Hutchins, 48 App.D.C. 286 (1919), is not to the contrary. It decided only that the probate court might decree to the executors an allowance on account of legal fees. The case did not involve the question of requiring executors to pay legal fees. Nor is Rule 47 of the District Court to the contrary. That Rule refers to the allowance of attorneys\u2019 fees, i. e., declarations that fees will pass when paid.</p>\n</footnote>\n</opinion>\n</casebody>\n",
