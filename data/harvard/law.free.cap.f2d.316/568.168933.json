It established its principal office and place of business in Great Neck, Long Island, New York, and embarked in the business of designing, procuring and distributing lines of household articles and equipment such as radios, phonographs, television sets, vacuum cleaners, sewing machines, typewriters and so forth under the trade name and mark \u201cGolden Shield.\u201d In April 1960 it qualified to do business in <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"570\">*570</page-number>Puerto Rico where it established an office and warehouse, and where, under contracts with the manufacturers, it was the exclusive distributor of a number of well known products such as Sylvania television sets, Gibson refrigerators, Barton electric washing machines, Perfection gas and electric appliances, Smith-Corona typewriters and other products which it marketed under its own name, with or without identification of the manufacturer. It soon developed a substantial and profitable business in Puerto Rico selling to five or six hundred retail concerns for the most part in the credit furniture field.</p>\n<p id=\"b622-4\">Soon after the plaintiff corporation was organized it employed the defendant William Israel, at first as Credit Manager and later as Vice President and controller, and shortly afterward it employed the defendant Alvin Gross, at first as a commission salesman and later as its Sales Manager in Puerto Rico. Both were employed for calendar years under written agreements, the last of which were renewed on February 10, 1961, and as of January 3, 1961, respectively. In these contracts Israel and Gross agreed to faithfully serve and to devote their whole time, attention and energies to Golden Shield\u2019s business and they also agreed that within one year from the date of the termination of. their employment they would not j'work for or assist any persons, firm or corporation engaged in, nor himself engage, directly or indirectly, in any line of business carried on at the time of his termination of employment by the Company, nor furnish any information to anyone engaged or interested in such line of business concerning the business transactions or business secrets of the Company or a subsidiary thereof.\u201d <em>^</em></p>\n<p id=\"b622-5\">Israel and Gross voluntarily terminated their employment with plaintiff on January 31 and February 3, 1962, respectively, and their resignations were promptly accepted.<footnotemark>1</footnotemark></p>\n<p id=\"b622-9\">On February 9, 1962, Golden Shield, invoking jurisdiction under 48 U.S.C. \u00a7 863, filed a complaint in the court below in which it alleged that Israel and Gross, being in effect in charge of its business in Puerto Rico, had become well acquainted with its suppliers, customers and personnel and with its arrangements with all of them, and charged the two with violating the trust and confidence reposed in them as employees and with violating the restrictive covenants in their employment agreements by early in 1962 secretly and surreptitiously conspiring to set up a competitive business and in pursuance of that objective causing the incorporation under the laws of Puerto Rico on January 24, 1962, of the corporate defendant, Universal Electric Corporation.</p>\n<p id=\"b622-10\">The court below acting on the complaint and supporting affidavits first issued a temporary restraining order under Rule 65 of the Federal Rules of Civil Procedure and a few days later, on notice, held a hearing on the plaintiff\u2019s application for a temporary injunction. Following that hearing, at which both individual defendants testified, the court filed a memorandum in which it said: \u201cIt would be difficult to find in the field of equity a case more typical of piracy toward a former employer so successfully accomplished by its former trusted employee than that resulting from the evidence in this action on the own admission of the culprits.\u201d On the next day the court filed formal findings of fact, two of which are as follows:</p>\n<blockquote id=\"b622-11\">\u201c(2) The individual defendant [s] secretively and unlawfully, prior to the termination of their employment by the plaintiff, organized the defendant corporation in Puerto Rico to operate a business competitive with the plaintiff, and in furtherance thereof wrongfully utilized the plaintiff\u2019s facilities and unlawfully appropriated records of the plaintiff, and while still in the plaintiff\u2019s em<page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"571\">*571</page-number>\u25a0ploy or immediately following the termination thereof on or about January 31, 1962, wrongfully approached suppliers and dealers of the plaintiff to advise such suppliers and \u25a0dealers of the establishment of such \u25a0competitive undertaking and to solicit their termination of relations with the plaintiff and the transfer of their business arrangements to the corporate defendant, and also solicited and enticed salesmen and other employees of the plaintiff from its \u25a0employ to enter the employ of the \u25a0corporate defendant.</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b623-5\">\u201c(3) The said acts of the defendants were designed, intended and calculated to damage the plaintiff irreparably and were in fact calculated to destroy its business.\u201d</blockquote>\n<p id=\"b623-6\">Then, brushing aside the defendants\u2019 -contention that the plaintiff had come into court with unclean hands and ruling that a preliminary injunction was necessary to avoid irreparable injury to the plaintiff from the continuation or resumption of the acts complained of, the court issued a preliminary injunction restraining the defendants in sweeping terms from competing with or in any way interfering with the plaintiff\u2019s business in Puerto Rico until further order of the court.</p>\n<p id=\"b623-7\">The defendants thereupon appealed under Title 28 U.S.C. \u00a7 1292(a) (1).</p>\n<p id=\"b623-8\">It clearly appears from the testimony of the individual appellants themselves that early in January 1962 they conceived the idea, which they did not disclose to their superiors, of taking over the plaintiff\u2019s lucrative Puerto Rican business for themselves, and that in furtherance of their plan caused the incorporation of the corporate appellant.<footnotemark>2</footnotemark> And Gross testified that before he resigned he approached a number of Golden Shield\u2019s salesmen and service employees in Puerto Rico with the view of obtaining their services for the corporate defendant and also approached some of Golden Shield\u2019s retail outlets with the view of inducing them to do business with his new organization. Moreover, he also testified that immediately after he resigned he solicited the business of a number of Golden Shield\u2019s customers. In short, the appellants do not deny the conduct attributed to them by the court below. Their contention is that their conduct does not warrant the legal consequences applied by that court, which ruled that the \u201c * * * acts of the defendants are improper and unlawful per se, as well as in violation of the individual defendants\u2019 express covenants with the plaintiff.\u201d</p>\n<p id=\"b623-10\">We quite agree with the court below. It seems to us clear that the conduct of the individual appellants as high officers of the plaintiff corporation who were in charge of its Puerto Rican business in joining forces to deprive their employer of its customers and employees in Puerto Rico not only violates the appellants\u2019 contracts of employment but also falls substantially below the standard imposed by law' upon persons acting as agents or employees of others.</p>\n<p id=\"b623-11\">The contracts of employment were signed in New York. And performance by Israel was to be in New York. Although performance by Gross was contemplated in Puerto Rico, we are' content, in the absence of any showing of a different legal rule in Puerto Rico, that New York law governs the interpretation of the contracts of employment, as the appellants contend. But in our opinion the appellants can draw no comfort from the law of that jurisdiction.</p>\n<p id=\"b623-12\">They strenuously contend that\" agreements not to compete should be looked upon with disfavor by the courts and should be strictly construed. However, it cannot be doubted that such agreements are valid if reasonable, the general rule as stated in Comment (a) to \u00a7 396 of the American Law Institute, Restatement, Agency being: \u201cA contract by an agent not to compete with his principal during such time as may reasonably be necessary for the protection of the <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"572\">*572</page-number>employer or principal is valid if it does not impose undue hardship on the agent (see Restatement, Contracts, \u00a7 516). Whether or not a particular contract imposes an undue hardship on the employee or is necessary for the employer\u2019s protection is a question of judgment.\u201d And this, in effect, is the rule in New York.<footnotemark>3</footnotemark> See Clark Paper &amp; Mfg. Co. v. Stenacher, 236 N.Y. 312, 140 N.E. 708, 29 A.L.R. 1325 (1923), in which in a case of this kind the New York Court of Appeals said: \u201cEach case must depend upon its own facts and circumstances.\u201d</p>\n<p id=\"AV6\"> Tested by the criterion of reasonableness the case at bar is clear. The contractual restriction is for only a year after termination of employment, which is certainly not an unreasonable length of time. And while the geographical area in which the restriction is applicable is not defined in the contracts of employment, we are here concerned only with Puerto Rico where the alleged conduct took place and where the injunction by its terms is only applicable. Clearly the restrictions are not unreasonable as to either time or area. Nor are they unreasonable in the restrictions they impose the appellants\u2019 business activities.</p>\n<p id=\"b624-7\">The appellants are not technically trained craftsmen in a narrow field, or like specialists, who are being deprived of their only means of livelihood. They are high level business executives whose talents may realistically be assumed to be useful in fields of endeavor other than in the specific line of business in which the plaintiff was engaged at the time of termination of employment. Nothing in their contracts prevents them from using their executive skills in allied fields of business or merchandising. We must assume that the appellants, as top echelon executives, knew what they were doing when they signed their contracts of employment, and we cannot assume that compliance with their contractual obligations would work unreasonable hardship upon them by depriving them of their only means of livelihood for a year.</p>\n<p id=\"b624-12\">From the plaintiff-employer\u2019s standpoint the contractual restrictions are equally reasonable. Indeed, the restrictions seem almost modest, for they serve to protect the plaintiff from, as events show, the very real danger of an instantaneous take-over, a virtual seizure, of the plaintiff\u2019s profitable Puerto Rican business by its high executives. We see nothing unreasonable in a contractual deterrent to that eventuality. In short, the contractual arrangement seems to us entirely reasonable from the point of view of the contracting parties.</p>\n<p id=\"b624-13\">But the appellants advanced a number of arguments directed to the proposition that for one reason or another the restrictive agreements are not binding upon them. We have canvassed these arguments and find them without merit. Indeed, only one of them, having to do with Gross\u2019s contract, impresses us as serious enough to warrant any discussion at all.</p>\n<p id=\"b624-14\">The pertinent provision of Gross\u2019s contract as originally drafted read: \u201cIn the event that Gross\u2019s employment is terminated at any time after December 31, 1961, at his option, Gross covenants that he will not, within one (1) year from the date of termination of his employment by the Company * * * work for or assist * * * \u201d etc. as quoted at the outset of this opinion. <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"573\">*573</page-number>However, in the agreement as signed everything prior to \u201cGross covenants\u201d was deleted so that as executed the provision reads \u201cGross covenants that he will not within one (1) year from the date of termination of his employment by the Company * * * \u201d etc. Contending that the phrase \u201cby the Company\u201d as used in the contract as executed has reference to \u201ctermination,\u201d Gross takes the position that the restrictive covenant applies only in the event that the Company terminated his employment and leaves him free to compete at once in the event that he should terminate his employment himself, as he did. The district court rejected this argument. It construed \u201cemployment <em>by </em>the Company\u201d as the equivalent in meaning to \u201cemployment <em>with </em>the Company\u201d and we agree.</p>\n<p id=\"b625-5\">\u201cEmployment by\u201d and \u201cemployment with\u201d are commonly used interchangeably. And one can hardly assume that the plaintiff would ever have agreed to let Gross, by electing whether or not to terminate his employment, to unilaterally determine the applicability of his agreement not to compete. The construction contended for by Gross is strained to say the least. To give the provision practical application as well as to follow the ordinary principle of grammar we hold the phrase \u201cby the Company\u201d to refer to the word \u201cemployment\u201d which immediately precedes it, not to refer to the more distant word \u201ctermination.\u201d</p>\n<p id=\"b625-6\">The other arguments advanced by the appellants on this phase of the litigation are too insubstantial to warrant discussion.</p>\n<p id=\"b625-7\">We are also of the view that the individual defendants\u2019 conduct, considered apart from their express contractual commitments, constituted actionable wrongs to their employer, Golden Shield.</p>\n<p id=\"b625-8\">At common law the employee owes a duty of loyalty to his employer. \u201cHe must not, while employed, act contrary to the employer\u2019s interests and, in general terms, owes a duty of loyalty as one of the incidents of the employer-employee relationship.\u201d Midland-Ross Corp. v. Yokana, 293 F.2d 411, 412 (C.A. 3, 1961), citing Restatement of Agency, Second, \u00a7 387. For full discussion of both common and civil law authorities in accord see McCormick v. Gonzalez, 49 P.R.R. 460, 466 (1936), in which the court said with reference to the law in Puerto Rico: \u201cThere is no doubt that the contract of agency is one of strict confidence and that the relation created by virtue of such contract is of a fiduciary character.\u201d It is clear to us, as it was to the court below, that the individual defendants on their own testimony convicted themselves of violating their duty of loyalty to their employer before they resigned. Their duties after resignation are another matter to which the court below did not address its attention with particularity since the restrictive agreements at that time were of paramount importance. We shall not discuss that matter either but only refer to Duane Jones Co., Inc., v. Burke, 306 N.Y. 172, 117 N.E.2d 237 (1954), which is closely in point and fully expounds the applicable law of New York.</p>\n<p id=\"b625-10\">We pass the question of the nature and scope of the individual defendants\u2019 post-employment duty to their employer apart from their contractual obligations because it is now over a year since their employments terminated and the one-year terms of their contractual obligations have expired. Wherefore modification of the broad terms of the preliminary injunction may well be in order since the injunction is couched in terms, of the defendants\u2019 strict contractual obligations rather than in terms of their perhaps less restricted duties independent of their contracts. The court below is, of course, open to the defendants to seek modification of the injunction outstanding against them should they be so advised.</p>\n<p id=\"b625-11\">The appellants\u2019 arguments that the plaintiff comes into court with unclean hands and that it has failed to show irreparable damage from the appellants\u2019 conduct are too lacking in merit to call for discussion.</p>\n<p id=\"b625-12\">Judgment will be entered affirming the order of the District Court.</p>\n<footnote label=\"1\">\n<p id=\"b622-6\">. Although Israel\u2019s contract provided for voluntary termination by either party upon thirty days\u2019 written notice, both sides appear throughout this litigation to have treated both resignations as effective immediately.</p>\n</footnote>\n<footnote label=\"2\">\n<p id=\"b623-13\">. Israel and Gross owned all of its stock.</p>\n</footnote>\n<footnote label=\"3\">\n<p id=\"b624-8\">.
