Eventually, the district court ordered \u201cthat the Motion for a Preliminary Injunction and all complaints and motions of Plaintiffs filed herein be and same are hereby dismissed.\u201d</p>\n<p id=\"b826-25\">The plaintiffs then filed several motions ; such as, to amend that order, for <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"775\">*775</page-number>a rehearing, and to correct the record. In ruling upon those motions the learned district judge patiently explained:</p>\n<blockquote id=\"b827-5\">\u201cAt the time of entering said order, rendering the same from the bench in open court, the Court made it clear to the plaintiff Marjorie Williamson why he was without jurisdiction: simply because a Federal court had neither appellate nor supervisory control over a State district judge. The plaintiff Marjorie Williamson is a lady who commands the respect of the Court and of the public, but she is before the Court here asking for something that the Court is without power to grant.</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b827-6\">\u201cPlaintiffs filed a suit in the State court of Dallas County, Texas, which came up for hearing before the Honorable Paul Peurifoy, Judge of the 95th Judicial District Court in Dallas County. The ruling of the Court was not acceptable to the plaintiffs and they come to the Federal court for a correction of such ruling and for instruction of the Federal judge as to how the case should be tried.</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b827-7\">\u201cIn deference to the fact that the plaintiff is a lady deserving consideration at our hands or the hands of any court we will again undertake to make clear to her why this court has no jurisdiction.</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b827-8\">\u201cIn the first place, the State courts are older than the Federal courts. They were here administering justice and functioning between litigants for 150 years before the Federal Government was organized. When the Constitution was written and adopted these State courts were not abolished nor subordinated to the national courts created by the Constitution of the new nation. The national courts have jurisdictipn only of those things conferred upon them by law. And at the time of the creation of the national courts and at time of writing the Constitution itself the State courts were kept as a separate and distinct judicial institution. As a result all cases that originate in the State court must be appealed to an appellate court of the State and thence to the Supreme Court of the State. All cases originating in the United States court must be appealed to the Circuit Court of the United States or to the Supreme Court of the United States. Nowhere has a Federal trial court been given supervisory or appellate jurisdiction over State judges.</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b827-10\">\u201cThis Court sitting as a Federal judge has no more authority to tell Judge Peurifoy how he must try your lawsuit than he has to tell us how we must run our court.</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b827-11\">\u201cSuch being the case the plaintiffs have mistaken their forum and have come to this court for relief that we are powerless to grant. Their case was originally dismissed for this reason and for the same reason the three motions that are now before us are also dismissed.</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b827-12\">\u201cThe case no longer holds any place upon the docket of the court and the Clerk is instructed to file nothing further herein unless expressly instructed by the Court.\u201d</blockquote>\n<p id=\"b827-13\">We cannot make the matter any clearer. It is perfectly plain that Section 2283 of Title 28, United States Code,<footnotemark>1</footnotemark> denies jurisdiction to a federal court to enjoin proceedings in a State court except in unusual circumstances not here present.</p>\n<p id=\"b827-14\">The judgment is Affirmed.</p>\n<footnote label=\"1\">\n<p id=\"b827-17\">. \u201c2283. <em>Stay of State court proceedings </em>\u201cA court of the United States may not grant an injunction to stay proceedings in a State court except as expressly authorized by Act of Congress, or where necessary in aid of its jurisdiction, or to protect or effectuate its judgments.\u201d</p>\n</footnote>\n</opinion>\n<opinion data-order=\"9\" data-type=\"opinion\" id=\"x999-2\" type=\"rehearing\">\n<p id=\"b827-15\">On Petition for Rehearing</p>\n<author id=\"AeR\">PER CURIAM.</author>\n<p id=\"b827-16\">The petition for rehearing and each of the other petitions filed therewith, that is, the petition to be allowed to amend the allegation of jurisdiction, the petition for this Court to issue a writ of injunction, and the amended petition for removal of a case from the 95th District Court in Dallas County, Texas, to the United States District Court, are hereby</p>\n<p id=\"AHb\">Denied.</p>\n</opinion>\n</casebody>\n",
