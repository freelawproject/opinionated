The agent\u2019s testimony was sufficient to send the issue to the jury, and the jury resolved it against the defendant, Thomas.</p>\n<p id=\"b239-24\">The appellant argues that the agent might have been mistaken, but as to this it was the province of the jury, not ours, to judge, and its finding is not reviewable on appeal.</p>\n<p id=\"b239-25\">Affirmed.</p>\n</opinion>\n</casebody>\n",
