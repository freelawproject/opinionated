It is a diversity case. (Facts supporting diversity jurisdiction were pleaded, but not that it was such a case.) Defendant-appellee herein originally (in another action) sued plaintiff-appellant herein to enjoin Frolich\u2019s use of the trademark \u201cMilk-O-Seltzer,\u201d alleging infringement with Miles Laboratories\u2019 \u201cAlka-Seltzer\u201d trademark. The district court found no infringement (195 F. Supp. 256). This court affirmed in a split decision (296 F.2d 740). Petition to the Supreme Court of the United States for certiorari was denied (369 U.S. 865, 82 S.Ct. 1030, 8 L.Ed.2d 84).</p>\n<p id=\"b139-24\">Frolich then filed this \u201cdamage suit\u201d against Miles Laboratories, arising from the unsuccessful action for infringement filed by Miles Laboratories, and the cost to Frolich of defending that suit, both in \u201cvaluable time and much money.\u201d Frolich \u201cprays\u201d for no relief, but his complaint asks for over a million dollars in damages, and contains a \u201cConclusion\u201d.<footnotemark>1</footnotemark> Appellant Miles Laboratories, Inc., pleaded in defense:</p>\n<p id=\"b139-25\">(a) Its previous successful attacks, either in the courts or before the Patent Office, on the use, as an infringing use, <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"88\">*88</page-number>of \u201cCarba-Seltzer\u201d (Miles Laboratories, Inc. v. Goodfriend, 1955, 106 U.S.P.Q. 336); \u201cFoam-O-Seltzer\u201d (Miles v. Starek, N.D.Ill., No. 15,544, 1938); \u201cVita-Seltzer\u201d (Miles v. Vita-Seltzer Co., 1941, 48 U.S.P.Q. 427, 1943, American Bio-Chemical Corp. v. Coe, D.C., 51 F.Supp. 430); \u201cPremo- Seltzer\u201d (Miles v. Blackman &amp; Blackman, 1935, Sup.Ct.N.Y., No. 11,704); and that it filed opposition to the registration of \u201cPepso-Seltzer\u201d which was unsuccessful and dismissed. Miles Laboratories v. Pepsodent, 1939, 104 F.2d 205, 26 CCPA 1272.</p>\n<p id=\"b140-4\">(b) That it had \u201cprobable cause\u201d in initiating civil proceedings, without any request for restraining orders.</p>\n<p id=\"b140-5\">(c) That it had a lack of malice.</p>\n<p id=\"b140-6\">In support of its motion for summary judgment based upon the failure of plaintiff to set forth a cause of action, and the lack of any genuine issue of fact, Miles Laboratories alleged:</p>\n<p id=\"b140-7\">(1) It had probable cause to believe it had a cause of action;</p>\n<p id=\"b140-8\">(2) it had sought to adjudicate its claim to trademark protection only;</p>\n<p id=\"b140-14\">(3) it acted upon advice of counsel;</p>\n<p id=\"b140-15\">(4) it acted without malice;</p>\n<p id=\"b140-16\">(5) it had successfully prosecuted at least six somewhat similar trademark infringement cases, some of which were-enumerated in its answer;</p>\n<p id=\"b140-17\">(6) this court had affirmed the trial court, but by a split decision.</p>\n<p id=\"b140-18\">The court below made Findings: as to jurisdiction, the nature of the pending action (for malicious prosecution) based on the action allegedly wrongfully filed (for trademark infringement and unfair competition); that the Miles Laboratories had probable cause and acted on advice of counsel; and that \u201cplaintiff appearing in propria persona stated orally in opposition to the motion for summary judgment that he knew that Miles-Laboratories, Inc., did not maliciously-bring the prior action that he was not. relying upon malice to prove his cause of action.\u201d <footnotemark>2</footnotemark></p>\n<p id=\"b140-19\">As Conclusions of Law, the court found defendant had probable cause to seek to adjudicate its claim; that there was no <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"89\">*89</page-number>malice; and no other material fact at issue.<footnotemark>3</footnotemark></p>\n<p id=\"b141-5\">Plaintiff-appellant has throughout all litigation mentioned herein acted as his own attorney. He has done this shrewdly, and at least during part of it, successfully. At the hearing below of the motion for summary judgment,<footnotemark>4</footnotemark> he did \u2022state:</p>\n<blockquote id=\"b141-6\">\u201cNow I\u2019m not going to try to prove in court that there was any malice by the directors of the company. I intend to prove that they did unjustly sue me * * * \u201d</blockquote>\n<p id=\"b141-7\">On oral argument before us, Mr. Frolich first says he did not say he did not intend to rely on malice, but if he did, he did not mean to say that \u2014 he intended to say there was no <em>criminal </em>malice. Further, that he was cut-off by the trial court when he tried to explain his layman\u2019s idea of the difference between \u201cmalice\u201d and \u201ccriminal malice\u201d in a civil suit \u201cin the nature of a suit for malicious prosecution.\u201d</p>\n<p id=\"b141-8\">What Mr. Frolich\u2019s understanding of the difference might be is of little consequence here, because of the court\u2019s finding that probable cause existed for Miles Laboratories\u2019 bringing the litigation, and its finding of a lack of malice resting on much more than Mr. Frolich\u2019s inadvertent statement.</p>\n<p id=\"b141-9\">Mr. Frolich earnestly believes that because he won the first suit that there was no probable cause for Miles Laboratories\u2019 bringing it, and that its institution had to be the result of \u201cnoncriminal\u201d malice. Not only did the court below find otherwise, but in our opinion it could have found in no other way, on the facts then before it and the applicable law. Rule 56(c) Fed.R.Civ.P. California law is applicable. Erie R. Co. v. Tompkins, 1938, 304 U.S. 64, 58 S.Ct. 817, 82 L.Ed. 1188. Cf. Restatement of Torts, \u00a7 674, et seq. Eastin v. Bank of Stockton, 1884, 66 Cal. 123, 4 P. 1106; Lotts v. Whitworth, 1946, 76 Cal.App.2d 601, 173 P.2d 823.</p>\n<p id=\"b141-15\">Actions for malicious prosecution are a disfavored action, for reasons of public policy. Haydel v. Morton, 1935, 8 Cal.App.2d 730, 48 P.2d 709; Sebastian v. Crowley, 1940, 38 Cal.App.2d 194, 202, 101 P.2d 120.</p>\n<blockquote id=\"b141-16\">\u201cThere is nothing improper in bringing a civil suit for personal ends, and consequently it is necessary to prove either actual ill will or some ulterior purpose distinct from that of enforcement of the alleged cause of action.\u201d Restatement of Torts, \u00a7 676.</blockquote>\n<p id=\"b141-17\">Witkin, Summary of California Law (6th Ed., p. 669).</p>\n<p id=\"b141-18\">Advice of counsel has \u201cthe usual effect of supplying probable cause.\u201d Restatement of Torts, \u00a7 675(b). Citizens State Bank v. Hoffman, 44 Cal.App.2d 854, 113 P.2d 221.</p>\n<p id=\"b141-19\">Mr. Frolich is as wrong now as he was right, in the opinion of the majority of this court, when he was heard on the ap<page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"90\">*90</page-number>peal of the original action. The trial court is as right on this appeal, when it ruled against Mr. Frolich, as it was in the opinion of the majority of this court when it originally favored him.</p>\n<p id=\"b142-4\">The summary judgment is <em>affirmed.</em></p>\n<footnote label=\"1\">\n<p id=\"b139-15\">. \u201cCONCLUSION\u201d</p>\n<p id=\"AQN\">\u201cThe Defendant has broken almost every Law of justice ever dreamed of in these United States.</p>\n<p id=\"A7r\">\u201cIf people like Miles Laboratories, Inc., would be allowed to continue these unlawful actions against the citizens of the United States at random on such stupid and childishly ridiculous charges as the Defendant sued the Plaintiff on, we the people of the United States have already lost our freedom.</p>\n<p id=\"AyS\">\u201cPlaintiff repeats again. How of all people the Miles Laboratories, Inc., who took the \u2018Alka\u2019 from \u2018Alka Zane\u2019 and the \u2018Seltzer\u2019 from \u2018Bsomo Seltzer\u2019 and almost overnight created a multi-million dollar business in the dead of the depression, could sue the Plaintiff for his use of the very common word \u2018Seltzer\u2019 is beyond <em>any </em>normal comprehension.</p>\n<p id=\"Aq5\">\u201cENCINO CHEMICALS</p>\n<p id=\"Aih\">\u201cBy HENRY J.
