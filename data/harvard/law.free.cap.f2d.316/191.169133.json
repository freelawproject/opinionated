The question/ arises on this appeal of plaintiff Thompson from an order of the District Court granting a motion to dismiss and directing a verdict for the defendant, Brotherhoood of Sleeping Car Porters.</p>\n<p id=\"b244-18\">Initiated on October 18, 1958,<footnotemark>1</footnotemark> in the Court of Common Pleas of Florence County, South Carolina, the action was removed to the federal District Court. There the defendant moved to quash service, and on June 16, 1960, the motion was denied pending the trial, but the question of service has not been pursued in this court. The trial was begun before a petit jury on December 11, 1961, and the verdict for the defendant was di<page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"193\">*193</page-number>rected at the conclusion of the plaintiff\u2019s case on December 13, 1961.<footnotemark>2</footnotemark></p>\n<p id=\"b245-4\">The complaint appears on its face to raise both federal and state causes of action. The theory of the federal cause of action was not explicated until late in the trial, and then never very clearly; but the crux of Thompson\u2019s allegations is that the Brotherhood was remiss in fulfilling its obligation, under the collective bargaining agreement between it and the Atlantic Coast Line Railroad and <em>under the Railway Labor Act, </em>45 U.S.C.A. \u00a7\u00a7 151-164, 181-188, \u201cto represent the Plaintiff in claims and grievances against the \u2018Railroad\u2019 and to protect the seniority rights of the Plaintiff as provided for by the Agreement setting forth said rights.\u201d <footnotemark>3</footnotemark> Only on review of the evidence does it begin to appear that the federal claim Thompson has attempted l to present is that the Brotherhood dis~| criminated against him in failing to prosecute conscientiously his claims to seniority, because he was not constant in his union membership. Thereby, says the plaintiff, the Brotherhood breached its statutory duty to represent him fairly and in good faith.</p>\n<p id=\"b245-6\">The plaintiff claimed that the acts of the Brotherhood caused him to lose his seniority as a Mail Porter, with resulting deprivation of his rightful tours of duty and opportunities for employment with the Railroad. He sought actual damages of $10,000 for past losses, plus allowance for such losses as might accrue pending a final determination, as well as punitive damages of $75,000.</p>\n<p id=\"b245-16\">FACTS</p>\n<p id=\"b245-17\">Thompson came to work for the Railroad in 1946. Until 1948, when he was given a regular assignment as a Train Porter (the higher classification), he worked \u201coff the extra board\u201d both as Mail and as Train Porter. He asserts that he also made occasional runs as a Mail Porter in 1951, 1953 and 1955. Although first listed on the Train Porters\u2019 Seniority Roster on January 1,1947, with seniority from January 18, 1946, the date of his initial run, he was not listed on the Mail Porters\u2019 Seniority Roster until January 1, 1957, with seniority from October 22, 1956. The delay in his listing on the Mail Porter roster occurred despite the apparently established practice under the collective bargaining agreements in effect from 1944 through 1956 <footnotemark>4</footnotemark> for a man to <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"194\">*194</page-number>acquire seniority from the first day he worked in a given classification and to be listed on both rosters if he worked in both classifications.<footnotemark>5</footnotemark></p>\n<p id=\"b246-4\">Thompson testified that he first received a copy of the Mail Porters\u2019 Seniority Roster in 1950 and only then discovered that he was not listed. Claim-\"' ing seniority from 1948, he protested to the Trainmaster and then to the Chairman of the Brotherhood\u2019s Local Lodge. Nothing was done in his behalf. The <em>\u00a1\u00a1 </em>reason assigned at the trial was that he had waived his right to seniority by not complaining within 60 days of the posting of the first roster listing Mail Porter seniority from 1948. See n. 4, supra. Subsequently, Thompson made persistent protests in 1952, 1953,1954,1955 and 1956 when the Mail Porters\u2019 Seniority Rosters were posted. In 1953, he apparently filed his first written complaint, still claiming seniority from 1948. He was unsuccessful in inducing action in his behalf by Railroad or by Local or international Brotherhood personnel, ostensibly because he was said to have waived his rights by failing to raise timely complaint.</p>\n<p id=\"b246-19\">In 1956 the job of Train Porter was in the process of being abolished in Thompson\u2019s district. Only then, after more than five years of repeated complaints, was a conference arranged between Thompson and representatives of the Brotherhood and of the Railroad. The evidence shows that the Railroad was agreeable to whatever arrangement its employees and the union might reach. At the conclusion of the conference, the Railroad agreed to a proposal to establish Thompson\u2019s seniority as Mail Porter from 1948. This proposal, however, was subject to the condition that the men who would thereby be made junior to Thompson / would agree. This they refused to do\u00bf Thompson then asserted a specific claim to seniority as of 1953. \u00a1Another^con? ference was held on October 22, 1956. The Railroad accepted a proposal to estab<page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"195\">*195</page-number>lish Mail Porter seniority as of 1953, but again the proposal was coupled with the condition that the men who would be made junior should agree. Again they refused.</p>\n<p id=\"b247-4\">On November 7, 1956, A. Philip Randolph, President of the Brotherhood, wrote the Superintendent of the Railroad suggesting that Thompson be placed on the Mail Porters\u2019 Seniority Roster with seniority from October 22, 1956, making him the \u201cyoungest\u201d Mail Porter on that roster. On November 16th, Randolph wrote Thompson advising him to agree to this settlement and to waive his more ambitious claims. On November 26th, Randolph informed the Superintendent that Thompson had agreed to the waiver and settlement.</p>\n<p id=\"b247-5\">Despite his having been placed on the Mail Seniority Roster, Thompson soon found that, since he was the \u201cyoungest\u201d on the list, he was rarely in line to make runs. In 1958 he made no runs at all; by 1961 his name no longer appeared on either the Mail or Train Porters\u2019 Seniority Roster.</p>\n<p id=\"b247-6\">\n<em>Evidence of Discrimination</em>\n</p>\n<p id=\"b247-7\">There is no intimation in the record that racial considerations entered the case, but at the trial the plaintiff adduced/ substantial evidence tending to show that,<footnotemark>7</footnotemark> because he adhered to the Brotherhood/ as a member only occasionally and not<footnotemark>7</footnotemark> regularly, it discriminated against him/ in processing and securing his seniority<footnotemark>7</footnotemark> rights, or rather in failing to represent\" him properly in these matters.<footnotemark>7</footnotemark> Thompson himself testified that he had joined the Brotherhood for a short period sometime between 1952 and 1954 only after warnings by the local chairman and an international organizer that he \u201cwould have to be in the union before they could do anything to help\u201d him. Although he also testified that he was a member for three months in 1951 and again briefly in 1956, he claimed that he joined on each occasion because the Brotherhood made it clear that this was the only way to gain its help in obtaining the seniority rights to which he was entitled.</p>\n<p id=\"b247-9\">A. J. Pringle, Secretary-Treasurer of the Local for six or seven years prior to the trial and Acting Chairman at the time of the trial, gave extensive testimony which strongly indicates a general policy of the Brotherhood not to recognize full responsibility as representative of a man unless he was in the organization. He testified further that Thompson\u2019s lack of steady membership was one reason the union did not accord him wholehearted support in the pursuit of his seniority claims. The impact of Pringle\u2019s and Thompson\u2019s testimony was cogently corroborated by a letter of May 8, 1956, addressed to Thompson by B. F. Mc-Laurin, International Field Organizer of the Brotherhood. He wrote:</p>\n<blockquote id=\"b247-10\">\u201cJ <em>am sure you were aware that there was nothing 1 could do until you became a full fledged member; now that you have followed through on your responsibility, rest assured that we will do the same at this end. </em>I have instructed your local chairman to request a formal hearing on your case. I trust that you will cooperate in every way possible to get this case started in order that we may be able to process it into the Railroad.\u201d (Emphasis added.)</blockquote>\n<p id=\"b247-12\">Nowhere in the record is the sharp point of this statement blunted.</p>\n<p id=\"b247-13\">Certain unexplained circumstances have a further bearing on the accusation of improper discrimination.</p>\n<p id=\"b247-14\">The Brotherhood claims that Thompson was the author of his own misfortune. It says that in not raising his grievances formally within the time limited by the collective bargaining agreements, he waived his claims to seniority. See n. 4, supra. The Brotherhood does not, however, explain how it happened that four other employees, who according to its argument likewise would appear to have failed to make timely claims, nevertheless <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"196\">*196</page-number>were not deemed to have waived their rights to seniority.<footnotemark>6</footnotemark></p>\n<p id=\"b248-4\">The Brotherhood\u2019s position is that not until 1956 did Thompson in specific language articulate his claim to seniority as of 1953 (and his claim to seniority as of 1955 not until the trial) and therefore, under a literal reading of the collective bargaining agreements, he waived these rights. Yet the record is barren of any legitimate circumstance to explain why the Brotherhood, put on notice by Thompson\u2019s determined insistence that he was entitled to seniority from 1948, was not itself moved earlier to secure him seniority rights, at least as of 1953 or 1955. The Brotherhood now interposes an expression of concern for several individuals whose seniority rights it permitted through its inaction, according to Thompson, to intervene ahead of him.</p>\n<p id=\"b248-5\">THE DISTRICT COURT\u2019S RULING</p>\n<p id=\"b248-6\">The District Court recognized as a matter of law that the Brotherhood \u201cowes the obligation to all the employees that they represent \u2014 to represent each and every employee regardless of whether he belongs to the union or not * * * [and that] the union owes the obligation to represent in good faith, that is, not to show partiality to one employee as against another employee in their representation of the respective employees.\u201d The District Court nevertheless directed a verdict for the defendant and dismissed the case at the close of the plaintiff\u2019s testimony.</p>\n<p id=\"b248-7\">First, the court appropriately observed that, under the Railway Labor Act, it was not empowered to \u201cpass upon the question of whether the seniority rights were rightly or wrongly concluded.\u201d But then it added:</p>\n<blockquote id=\"b248-11\">\u201cIn order for this plaintiff to have a cause of action under the theory that he has brought his action here, he in effect would have to affirmatively, by competent testimony in this case, establish fraud on the part of the union in its dealings with him as an individual.\u201d</blockquote>\n<p id=\"b248-12\">Treating Thompson\u2019s specific allegations of fraud and deceit, conspiracy, and misrepresentation as an attempt \u201cto make out a case under the theory of fraud,\u201d the court, \u201coperating under the law of South Carolina,\u201d concluded that the plaintiff had failed to make out a case. In its order the court stated:</p>\n<blockquote id=\"b248-13\">\u201cAt the conclusion of plaintiff\u2019s evidence, defendant moved for dismissal or directed verdict in its favor upon several specified grounds. The only one necessary for decision here being that there is no evidence upon which it could reasonably be found that the defendant has been guilty of the misconduct alleged in the complaint.\u201d</blockquote>\n<p id=\"b248-14\">It is not clear whether the court meant by this that, having first disposed of a federal cause of action, it was now dealing, either under the doctrine of pendent jurisdiction<footnotemark>7</footnotemark> or under diversity jurisdiction, with a state cause of action, or that it was treating a federal cause of action under the impression that it was governed by state law. Whatever may have been its reasoning, we are compelled to the conclusion that the court erred in its treatment of the federal cause which arises under the Railway Labor Act. <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"197\">*197</page-number>Either it mistakenly concluded that the plaintiff did not sufficiently allege or offer proof of a federal right within the jurisdiction of the court to protect, or it improperly concluded that plaintiff\u2019s federal right could not be sustained without proof of fraud under state law.<footnotemark>8</footnotemark></p>\n<p id=\"b249-4\">THE DUTY OF FAIR REPRESENTATION</p>\n<p id=\"b249-5\">Paradoxically, it is Thompson who questions whether he has properly stated and offered proof of a federal cause of action. He argues in the alternative: First he insists that the case was improvidently removed. Not only, says he, is there no diversity of citizenship but there is no justiciable federal question because, unlike the cases of Steele v. Louisville &amp; Nashville R. R., 323 U.S. 192, 65 S.Ct. 226, 89 L.Ed. 173 (1944), and Tunstall v. Brotherhood of Locomotive Firemen, 323 U.S. 210, 65 S.Ct. 235, 89 L.Ed. 187 (1944), the Brotherhood has not been accused of racial discrimination. As we understand it, however, his argument then continues: if there is federafl jurisdiction, he has proved a prima facie case of \u201cinvidious discrimination\u201d in breach of the Brotherhood\u2019s statutory duty of fair representation, a duty first recognized in the Steele decision. It is with the appellant\u2019s second proposition^ that we agree.</p>\n<p id=\"Akj\">we a&lt;imimstration of collective aYreements.<footnotemark>11</footnotemark> Furthermore, the jurisdiction of the National Railroad Adjustment Board to resolve \u201c[t]he disputes between an employee or group of em~ ployees and a carrier or carriers growing out of grievances or out of the interpreta As this court recently had occasion to say, \u201c[i]t is well established that, under both the Railway Labor Act and the National Labor Relations Act, 29 U.S.C.A. \u00a7 151 et seq., a bargaining agent must fairly and without discrimination represent all employees in the bargaining unit, and that employees discriminatorily treated have recourse to the federal courts.\u201d Hostetler v. Brotherhood of Railroad Trainmen, 287 F.2d 457, 458 (4th Cir., 1961), cert. denied, 368 U.S. 955, 82 S.Ct. 397, 7 L.Ed.2d 387 (1962). Characterized as the duty of fair repre- ^ sentation, the bargaining agent\u2019s obligation arises under the federal labor acts, <em>r </em>Professor Summers has observed: \u201cThe' source of the union\u2019s duty to the individual is * * * its statutory power to bargain and make binding agreements which in fact govern the individual\u2019s employment.\u201d <footnotemark>9</footnotemark> Initially formulated in^ class actions involving racial discrimination in the negotiation of collective bargaining agreements,<footnotemark>10</footnotemark> the duty of fair representation has been held to extend as or application of agreements con<page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"198\">*198</page-number>cerning rates of pay, rules, or working conditions * * 45 U.S.C.A. \u00a7 153 First (i), is not a bar to employees\u2019 court actions \u201cagainst the bargaining agent to enforce their statutory right not to be unfairly discriminated against by it in bargaining.\u201d <footnotemark>12</footnotemark></p>\n<p id=\"b250-5\">At a relatively early stage in the development of this doctrine, this court expressed the opinion that the judicially * enforceable duty of fair representation^ was limited to cases involving racial discrimination and that the National Railroad Adjustment Board was the proper-body to resolve claims of non-racial discrimination.<footnotemark>13</footnotemark> Yet in Hostetler, supra, we expressly recognized the duty of fair representation and examined, without reference to the earlier decisions in our circuit, an alleged breach of the duty that was wholly unrelated to race. \\</p>\n<p id=\"b250-17\">An overwhelming body of judicial opinion and learned commentary, appearing principally after Alabaugh v. Baltimore &amp; O. R. R. n. 13, supra, now persuades us that that decision represents too narrow a view. The Supreme Court\u2019s adjudications touching this judicially en&gt; forceable statutory duty<footnotemark>14</footnotemark> should be interpreted as also prohibiting invidious discrimination that is not based upon race<footnotemark>15</footnotemark> At least in the absence of a valid <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"199\">*199</page-number>union shop agreement \u2014 there is no such agreement here \u2014 disparate treatment .in representation cannot be tolerated when based on the disadvantaged individual\u2019s or group\u2019s non-membership in the statutory bargaining agent. Such disparity in treatment constitutes a conspicuous example of forbidden discrimination that is not necessarily related to race. Depending upon the facts, it may violate the bargaining agent\u2019s statutory duty of fair representation.<footnotemark>16</footnotemark> A union has no more justification to discriminate injuriously in its representation on the ground of non-membership, or instability of membership, or even because of persistent and vocal complaints or other obnoxious behavior, than it has to discriminate on account of skin pigmentation. None of these circumstances is relevant to the fair and proper discharge of a union\u2019s duty to those it is empowered to represent and whose employment is governed by. its binding agreements.</p>\n<p id=\"b251-5\">Although the District Court correctly concluded that it was without general power to review the correctness of the seniority rights accorded to the plaintiff, sufficient, even if inartful, allegations were made of a claim that the Brotherhood breached its statutory obligation to represent him fairly and to accord him- equality with Brotherhood members in respect to his seniority rights as a Mail Porter. Litigation of this particular claim, merely seeking damages from the Brotherhood, involves only incidentally a consideration of the collective bargaining agreements and Thompson\u2019s seniority rights. See Conley v. Gibson, 355 U.S. 41, 44-45, 78 S.Ct. 99, 2 L.Ed.2d 80 (1957).</p>\n<p id=\"b251-11\">We have been admonished that to \u201cadequately set forth a claim upon which relief could be granted,\u201d it is not necessary that the claim be well developed in the complaint for \u201ca complaint should not be dismissed for failure to state a claim unless it appears beyond doubt that the plaintiff can prove no set of facts in support of his claim which would entitle him to relief.\u201d See Conley v. Gibson, supra at 45-46, 78 S.Ct. at 101-102, 2 L.Ed.2d 80. It cannot be said that Thompson\u2019s complaint is deficient under this test.</p>\n<p id=\"b251-12\"> Thompson\u2019s theory posits a federal right, and therefore federal rather than state law governs.<footnotemark>17</footnotemark> State law may sometimes provide useful guides in deter<page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"200\">*200</page-number>mining this federal right. Cf. Textile Workers Union v. Lincoln Mills, 353 U.S. 448, 457, 77 S.Ct. 923, 1 L.Ed.2d 972 (1957). But in this case, to speak in terms of \u201cfraud and deceit,\u201d \u201cconspiracy,\u201d and \u201cmisrepresentation\u201d \u2014 state common law concepts \u2014 is not particularly useful and is misleading. The Supreme Court has, in fact, already enunciated the broad doctrinal standards for determining whether the duty of fair representation has been breached. \u201c[H]ostile discrimination,\u201d \u201cinvidious\u201d discrimination or \u201cdiscriminations not based on * * * relevant differences\u201d is prohibited.</p>\n<blockquote id=\"b252-5\">\u201cThis does not mean that the statutory representative of a craft is barred from making contracts which may have unfavorable effects on some of the members of the craft represented. Variations in the terms of the contract based on differences relevant to the authorized purposes of the contract in conditions to which they are to be applied, such as differences in seniority, the type of work performed, the competence and skill with which it is performed, are within the scope of the bargaining representation of a craft, all of whose members are not identical in their interest or merit.\u201d</blockquote>\n<p id=\"b252-6\">Steele v. Louisville &amp; Nashville R. R., 323 U.S. 192, 203, 65 S.Ct. 226, 89 L.Ed. 173 (1944). But, any discrimination in treatment must be based upon relevant, non-invidious distinctions for, while \u201c [a] wide range of reasonableness must be allowed a statutory bargaining representative in serving the unit it represents, [it is] subject always to complete good faith and honesty of purpose in the exercise of its discretion.\u201d Ford Motor Co. v. Huffman, 345 U.S. 330, 338, 73 S.Ct. 681, 686, 97 L.Ed. 1048 (1953).</p>\n<p id=\"b252-9\">In the present case, it appears neces-H sary to pursue only one line of inquiry to resolve the questions of \u201cinvidious <em>discrimination,\" </em>\u201creasonableness,\u201d \u201cgood faith and honesty\u201d: Did the plaintiff \\ show that he received different or sub- j stantially sub-standard representation at the hands of the Brotherhood? If so, I was it because of some improper reason, | such as his unsatisfactory union statusXi Did this treatment cause him injury? If the answers of the trier of fact to the three questions are in the affirmative, the plaintiff is entitled to relief.</p>\n<p id=\"b252-10\">\n<em>The Defense of \u201cWaiver and Settlement\u201d</em>\n</p>\n<p id=\"b252-11\">In its answer the Brotherhood interposed the defense that the plaintiff, by authorizing the Brotherhood to make an agreement with the Railroad acknowledging his Mail Porter seniority as of October 22, 1956, had entered into a \u201cfull accord and satisfaction for the claim alleged in the complaint, and that the plaintiff in so authorizing the defendant to act, waived his seniority rights.\u201d <footnotemark>18</footnotemark> In its brief the Brotherhood contends that \u201cthe record disproves the allegation [of coercion] of the complaint. The record shows only that the defendant advised plaintiff to accept the proposal that defendant had obtained from the Railroad in his behalf. He was not threatened, he was not cajoled. He was perfectly free to accept or not, as he wished. * # <em>*\u00bb</em></p>\n<p id=\"b252-13\">We think the plaintiff is not barred from bringing this suit. His federal cause of action, as we have seen, is based on an alleged breach of the defendant\u2019s statutory obligation to represent him <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"201\">*201</page-number>fairly. Although the Supreme Court has not explicitly characterized this obligation by the very term \u201cfiduciary relationship,\u201d its treatment of the subject is tantamount thereto. It has in fact said that \u201c [b] argaining agents who enjoy the advantages of the Railway Labor Act\u2019s provisions <em>must execute their trust </em>without lawless invasions of the rights of other workers.\u201d (Emphasis added.)<footnotemark>19</footnotemark> While it is not always appropriate to transplant common law concepts to the field of labor relations, it is plain that in the Supreme Court\u2019s view the federal statutory duty of fair representation is not unlike a common law fiduciary obligation.<footnotemark>20</footnotemark> It would be anomalous to bar as a matter of law the plaintiff\u2019s suit for an alleged breach of the union\u2019s \u201cfiduciary obligation\u201d because, finding himself in economic straits due to the \u201cfiduciary\u2019s\u201d alleged misfeasance, or nonfeasance, he executed, upon its advice, a waiver of rights that it should have secured for him. Cf. Restatement of the Law of Trust \u00a7 216-18 (2d. ed. 1959).</p>\n<p id=\"b253-5\">\n<em>Other Defenses: Intervening Rights and Role of the Railroad</em>\n</p>\n<p id=\"AGp\">On the merits the defendant contends that in 1956 it did all that it could for the plaintiff, since (1) it had to protect the interests of other individuals whose seniority rights had intervened and to whom it also owed a duty of fair representation and (2) the Railroad, not the Brotherhood, administered seniority rights. Were the focus of attention only upon the Brotherhood\u2019s efforts in Thompson\u2019s behalf in 1956, it might be possible to conclude, as a matter of law, that its conduct did not fall short of its duty, for the intervening rights of other employees would be paramount. But the conferences conducted in 1956 must be examined in the light of events that according to Thompson occurred in the earlier years. The question as to the conferences is whether the Brotherhood in 1956 could or should have acted more positively to remedy its earlier omissions, if there were omissions as claimed.</p>\n<p id=\"b253-7\">In this regard, it is relevant not only that administration of seniority rights was subject to contract grievance procedures (see n. 4, supra), but also that there is evidence supporting the Railroad\u2019s insistence that it had little interest in the way the Brotherhood adjusted grievances involving the competitive interests of employees. The Railroad was <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"202\">*202</page-number>ruled in its attitude chiefly by a desire to maintain good relations with the Brotherhood. It was content to allow the Brotherhood to act as judge in the adjustment of seniority questions among the employees. The Brotherhood\u2019s role was not one of mere passivity.</p>\n<p id=\"b254-4\">In these circumstances, it could well be concluded that telling the plaintiff he could have his seniority rights, at least in part, provided they were acquiesced in by the very employees who stood to gain from withholding agreement, was less than the kind of support he had the right to expect from his representative. It may well be that if the Brotherhood declined in 1956 to take a more affirmative position to vindicate plaintiff\u2019s rights, which according to the plaintiff had been put in jeopardy by the Brotherhood\u2019s own earlier defaults, this would not be an adequate discharge of its duty as plaintiff\u2019s representative. It could not shield itself behind either the claim that technically the Railroad administers seniority rights, or that other employees\u2019 rights had intervened.</p>\n<p id=\"b254-5\">\n<em>Legal Effect of the Evidence</em>\n</p>\n<p id=\"Agi\">.We are in complete accord with the Sixth Circuit Court of Appeals\u2019 recent observation that in passing upon allegations charging that a union breached its duty of fair representation \u201c[whether the bargaining representative has acted fairly and impartially and without hostile discrimination depends upon the facts of each case.\u201d Trotter v.

The court concluded, in these cases, that there had been no' factual demonstration of breach of the duty of fair representation. Upon the showing made in the instant case, however, it could reasonably be found that the plaintiff was not remiss in the assertion of his rights but from 1950 had made timely protests, repetitious''to the point of monotony, to representatives of the Railroad and of the Brotherhood. It could be found that the Brotherhood was unwilling to protect him equally with others it represented because he was a nonmember or only an occasional member. Upon the record, it could well be concluded that the Brotherhood, pursuing a policy, sometimes openly declared, of favoring its more loyal adherents, ignored the plaintiff\u2019s protests or presented them feebly with no genuine effort to establish his rights. In short, the testimony would support a finding that the Brotherhood\u2019s conduct evidenced a purpose not to press the plaintiff\u2019s complaints effectively, but to stifle them.</p>\n<p id=\"b254-8\">On the other hand, of course, the trier of facts could, in the choice made of the items of testimony to be believed and in their interpretation, accept the defendant\u2019s version and reach the opposite conclusion. Yet the record cannot be said to admit of that conclusion only. A verdict on the facts was called for rather than a determination as a matter of law.</p>\n<p id=\"b254-9\">Viewing the evidence most favorably to the plaintiff, and in the doctrinal framework examined above, it was sufficient to present a prima facie case of a breach of his federal right. Therefore, the District Court had federal question jurisdiction and the defendant should not have been nonsuited. Thompson is entitled to a new trial. Cf. Crowell v. Palmer, 134 Conn. 502, 58 A.2d 729 (1948).</p>\n<p id=\"b254-10\">\n<em>Amendment of Pleadings and Evidence at New Trial</em>\n</p>\n<p id=\"b254-11\">At such new trial, the plaintiff should be permitted, as he requested in the District Court, to amend his complaint to plead 1953, 1955, or any other appropriate year as to which he can allege, in good faith, that had the Brotherhood acted with sufficient regard for his rights .he would have been entitled and able to secure seniority as a Mail Porter. The \u201ctime tickets,\u201d offered in evidence but- rejected below, and. any other valid documentary .proof that he made runs as a Mail .Porter.during.the year's covered by the amendment, or. otherwise relating <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"203\">*203</page-number>to his seniority, should-be admitted. At a minimum, such proof bears upon the question whether the Brotherhood had knowledge of the fact that Thompson may have been entitled to Mail Porter seniority as of dates other than 1948 or 1956. This in turn bears on the question whether the Brotherhood, put on notice by the plaintiff\u2019s unremitting pleas for seniority as of 1948, should have attempted to secure seniority for him as of 1953, 1955, or some other date earlier than October 22, 1956.<footnotemark>21</footnotemark></p>\n<p id=\"b255-5\">Reversed and remanded for a new trial in accordance with the opinion of this court.</p>\n<footnote label=\"1\">\n<p id=\"b244-11\">.

On appeal, counsel for the defendant contended that senioi'ity would not accrue until an employee had a regular assignment in the given category. The testimony on this point was in conflict. Thompson, however, was in fact listed on the Train Porters\u2019 Seniority Roster before he was regularly assigned, when -he still worked \u201coff the extra board\u201d both as Train and as Mail Porter. In addition, the seniority rosters introduced in evidence show that J. G. Reed was credited with both Train and Mail Porter seniority as of December 18, 1947, and R. A. Anderson was credited with seniority in both categories as of November 15, 1950, which was the very date he entered the Railroad\u2019s service. At least until explained otherwise, the above roster entries might properly be interpreted by the trier of facts as demonstrating that an individual could be listed simultaneously on both rosters without holding regular jobs in both categories.</p>\n</footnote>\n<footnote label=\"6\">\n<p id=\"b248-8\">. According to the seniority rosters in evidence : J. G-. Reed was first credited with Mail Porter Seniority from December 18, 1947, on the roster of July 1, 1953; R. A. Anderson was first credited with both Mail and Train Porter Seniority from November 15, 1950, on the roster of July 1, 1953; Amos Maxwell was first credited with Train Porter Seniority from April 15, 1953, on the \u201crevised\u201d roster of July 1, 1955; and Joe Singletary, Jr., was first credited with Train Porter Seniority from October 14, 1955, on the roster of January 1, 1957.</p>\n</footnote>\n<footnote label=\"7\">\n<p id=\"b248-16\">.

May punitive damages be awarded in this action arising under the Railway Labor Act? This court abstains for the present from passing upon the question. It was not raised on appeal nor apparently in the District Court, but our research discloses that at least one district court has addressed itself to this issue. See Brady v. Trans World Airlines, Inc., 196 F.Supp. 504 (D.Del.1961).
