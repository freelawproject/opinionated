The Union was allowed every opportunity to present its views on the question of compliance and in disapproval of the settlement. The settlement agreement is in substantial accord with the provisions of the decree in our No. 12,912. The petition before us is clearly ancillary to that cause. There has been no abuse of discretion by the Board in working out the settlement of the obligations under our decree. In its settlement of the problems presented, the Board reached an admirable, practical result under all of the difficult circumstances. See Piasecki Aircraft Corporation v. National Labor Relations Board, No. 12,912. (International Union, etc., et al. v. National Labor Relations Board) 280 F.2d 575 (3 Cir. 1960).</p>\n<p id=\"b291-15\">The petition will be denied.</p>\n</opinion>\n</casebody>\n",
