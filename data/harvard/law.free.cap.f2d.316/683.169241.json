That amount was paid to appellant in January 1959. Subsequently, however, the Court of Claims and the Comptroller General rendered opinions which the Navy Department interpreted to the effect that a decision of the Corrections Board could not operate to supersede statutes of limitation. Accordingly, appellant was notified in March 1961 that the $809.93 payment was erroneous. To recover this amount, monthly installments of $75.00 were withheld from appellant\u2019s retirement pay.<footnotemark>4</footnotemark></p>\n<p id=\"b736-15\">Appellant instituted the present suit in November 1961, alleging that the decision of the Corrections Board pursuant to 10 U.S.C. \u00a7 15G2 \u201cis final and conclusive on all officers of the United States.\u201d<footnotemark>5</footnotemark> In March 1962, while this suit was pending in the District Court and when the monthly installments withheld totaled $750.00, further withholding of the final installment of $59.93 was suspended pending final disposition. Thereafter, the District Court granted appellee\u2019s motion to dismiss which alleged that (1) since the United States is an indispensable party, there is lack of jurisdiction over all indispensable parties; and (2) this is an action by a Government officer for compensation for official services, over which the District Court is expressly denied jurisdiction by 28 U.S.C. \u00a7 1346 (d). Since we think the judgment below may be sustained on the second ground, it is unnecessary to consider the first.</p>\n<p id=\"b737-4\"><page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"685\">*685</page-number>The Tucker Act<footnotemark>6</footnotemark> contains the basic waiver of sovereign immunity to contract actions against the United States. Jurisdiction over actions authorized by the Act is vested in the Court of Claims, with concurrent jurisdiction in the district courts over claims not exceeding $10,000 in amount. However, 28 U.S.C. \u00a7 1346 (d) specifically excludes from the jurisdiction of the district courts</p>\n<blockquote id=\"b737-5\">\u201c(1) Any civil action or claim for a pension;</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b737-6\">\u201c (2) Any civil action or claim to recover fees, salary, or compensation for official services of officers or employees of the United States.\u201d</blockquote>\n<p id=\"b737-7\"> Appellant urges that this exclusion is inapplicable because he is not seeking recovery of back retirement pay but rather a declaration that appellee acted beyond the scope of statutory authority in withholding the $750.00 from retirement pay, and an injunction against withholding the $59.93 in the future. Clearly, \u00a7 1346(d) bars the District Court from entertaining any claim for the recovery of the $750.00 already withheld. Nor is the bar removed by clothing the \u2022claim in a complaint for declaratory relief. DiBenedetto v. Morgenthau, 80 U.S.App.D.C. 34, 148 F.2d 223 (1945); Almour v. Pace, 90 U.S.App.D.C. 63, 193 F.2d 699 (1951). The District Court may declare individual rights of a suitor who also possesses a monetary claim cognizable solely in the Court of Claims only if such declaration \u201cwould affect his \u00a1status or establish his rights <em>as to the future </em>vis-a-vis some governmental agency.\u201d Almour v. Pace, supra. Any declaration of rights concerning the $750.00 in question would not have such effect \u2022since it involves \u201cretirement pay for a fixed past period \u2014 a claim over which the Court of Claims has exclusive jurisdiction * * Ibid.</p>\n<p id=\"b737-8\">The question remaining is whether the appellant\u2019s request for relief from the threatened withholding of $59.93 in the future is a sufficient basis for District Court jurisdiction. This request is ancillary to the main objective of recovering $750.00, and as to which the Court of Claims has full power to decide all the questions of statutory authority urged by appellant in this suit. Moreover, it may be fairly argued that the amount of the threatened withholding borders on de minimis. Hurley v. Shanley, 61 App.D.C. 237, 60 F.2d 335 (1932). In similar circumstances we have previously held that the District Court has discretion to decline the exercise of whatever jurisdiction is arguably open to it. Di Benedetto v. Morgenthau, <em>supra; </em>Almour v. Pace, supra. We find no abuse of that discretion in the present case.</p>\n<p id=\"b737-12\">Affirmed.</p>\n<footnote label=\"1\">\n<p id=\"b736-11\">. 28 U.S.C. \u00a7 2501.</p>\n</footnote>\n<footnote label=\"2\">\n<p id=\"b736-12\">.
