The plaintiff contends that the Labor-Management Reporting and Disclosure Act, \u00a7 101(a) (4), 29 U.S.C.A. \u00a7 411(a) (4) (1959), gives him the right to bring an action in the District Court against the Union to make the Union enforce or assist him in enforcing his rights to benefits against the trustees of the United Mine Workers of America Welfare and Retirement Fund.</p>\n<p id=\"b527-21\">The District Court dismissed the action below on the grounds that it did not have jurisdiction and that the complaint did not state a cause of action. We affirm. Horn v. Amalgamated Ass\u2019n of Street, Elec. Ry. &amp; Motor Coach Emp., 194 F.Supp. 560 (E.D.Mich.1961); Allen v. Armored Car Chauffeurs and Guards, etc., 185 F.Supp. 492 (D.N.J.1960).</p>\n</opinion>\n</casebody>\n",
