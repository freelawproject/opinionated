Apart from all other considerations, we find no support for the contention that admiralty will not entertain a suit by an assignee; the contrary sensible rule seems well-established. Cobb v. Howard, 5 Fed.Cas.No. 1133, No. 2924 (S.D.N.Y.1856); Henry Admiralty Jurisdiction and Procedure (1885), \u00a7 108; American Steel Barge Co. v. Chesapeake &amp; Ohio Coal Agency Co., 115 F. 669, 673-674 (1 Cir. 1902); The Mandu, 102 F.2d 459, 461-462 (2 Cir. 1939). We affirm the judgment in open court.</p>\n</opinion>\n</casebody>\n",
