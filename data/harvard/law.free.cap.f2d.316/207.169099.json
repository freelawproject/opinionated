Cobb v. Cavell, 161 F.Supp. 174 (1958). This decision was affirmed by us per curiam, 3 Cir., 258 F.2d 946 (1958). We are of the view now as we were then that the relator\u2019s position is not meritorious. Moreover in respect to his present application the relator has not filed any notice of appeal in the court below and therefore it would be a futile gesture to grant him a certificate of probable cause. Accordingly the application for the certificate will be denied.</p>\n</opinion>\n</casebody>\n",
