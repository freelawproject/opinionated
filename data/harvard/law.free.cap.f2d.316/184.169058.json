The libellee-mortgagor conceded that he had failed to provide insurance as he had covenanted to do in the mortgage. He rested his defence on two grounds, first that the vessel was uninsurable when he purchased it from the mortgagee-libellant and second that the libellant ought to have insured the vessel himself, as the mortgage authorized him to do in the event the mortgagor did not.</p>\n<p id=\"b237-9\">The court below after a hearing found the libellee\u2019s evidence that the vessel was uninsurable at the time it was sold \u201cnot convincing.\u201d It said: \u201cOn the contrary, I find it a fact that the vessel on that date was insurable in the hands of the libellant.\u201d With respect to the other defence the court said: \u201cThe right that the libellant reserved to insure at the expense of the libellee was a personal right and one to be exercised or not at the libellant\u2019s discretion. If the libellee could not secure insurance from companies acceptable to the libellant, it can hardly be supposed that the libellant was in any better position where the care and custody of the boat were left to the libellee.\u201d</p>\n<p id=\"b237-12\"> On this appeal from a decree of foreclosure the appellant cannot challenge the basic finding on which the court below based its decree, for he has not included the evidence in the record appendix to his brief. The finding of fact made by the court below supports its conclusion of breach by the mortgagorlibellee of his covenant to insure.</p>\n<p id=\"b237-13\">Judgment will be entered affirming the decree of the District Court.</p>\n</opinion>\n</casebody>\n",
