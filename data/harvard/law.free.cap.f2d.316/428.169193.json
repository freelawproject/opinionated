McKee (no relation to the trustee), the \u201csole stockholder and the dominant factor in its (the bankrupt corporation) operation during the effective period of the bond,\u201d (language of the complaint) it appearing further that the trustee notified the defendant only after the expiration of 18 months from the termination date of the bond (approximately the date the trustee was appointed), and it appearing that the trustee did not notify the surety within 90 days of the alleged date of discovery, we conclude:</p>\n<p id=\"b481-20\">That the obligee under the bond, the bankrupt, had \u201cdiscovered\u201d the loss within the twelve months\u2019 period by reason of the fact that Robert A. McKee, the principal officer and sole stockholder who perpetrated the fraud, as a matter of law was the alter ego of the <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"430\">*430</page-number>obligee-bankrupt, and that no notice having been given within 90 days after this imputed discovery by the obligee, the trustee who has no more rights than the bankrupt itself, may not maintain the suit. The fact that McKee took the corporation\u2019s money does not insulate it from the knowledge he possessed since there was no adverse interest between McKee and the corporation wholly owned by him. Cf. Franklin Savings &amp; Loan Co. v. American Employees Ins. Co., 5 Cir., 99 F.2d 494. Furthermore, we find that by the plaintiff\u2019s own allegations the \u201cdiscovery\u201d did not occur until after the expiration of the allowable twelve months\u2019 period, so that the trustee is precluded by the first condition precedent to maintaining an action on this bond.</p>\n<p id=\"b482-4\">The judgment is</p>\n<p id=\"A7\">Affirmed.</p>\n</opinion>\n</casebody>\n",
