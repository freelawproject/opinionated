Respondent refused to entertain consideration of the applications on their merits on the ground that he was without jurisdiction to grant the relief sought.</p>\n<p id=\"b279-14\">The application of petitioner here will be permitted to be docketed without prepayment of fee, but the request for issuance of a writ against respondent will be denied.</p>\n<p id=\"b279-15\">The communications addressed to respondent are, as has been indicated, somewhat informal and unclear, but one of them appears to be an attempt to have the court consider and \u201crender judgment\u201d on a claim for benefits or payments which had been denied by the Veterans\u2019 Administration. The other appears to seek to have the court require \u201cR. V. Lee, Major General, U.S.A., The Adjutant General\u201d to sign and cause to be notarized a letter written by him to Congressman Philip J. Philbin, of Massachusetts, which the Congressman had transmitted to petitioner. General Lee\u2019s letter contained his stamped instead of written signature. The contents of the letter dealt with the facts underlying petitioner\u2019s claim for veterans\u2019 disability benefits. Petitioner desired the letter signed and notarized in order, as he says, to be able to use it as a \u201cdocument of proof\u201d in the judicial challenge which he desired to make to the Veterans\u2019 Administration\u2019s action on his claim.</p>\n<p id=\"b279-16\">Under 38 U.S.C.A. \u00a7 211, the decision of the Veterans\u2019 Administration on petitioner\u2019s claim for benefits or payments is \u201cfinal and conclusive and no * * * court of the United States shall have power or jurisdiction to review any such decision\u201d. Corollarially, and without regard to other grounds which might exist for denial of jurisdiction to compel signing and notarization of the letter on the part of General Lee, there could be no basis for requesting the court to perfect evidence in relation to a suit which there existed no right to bring.</p>\n<p id=\"b279-17\">Application for writ denied.</p>\n</opinion>\n</casebody>\n",
