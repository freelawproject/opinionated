An appeal from this judgment was timely filed in this court and was here affirmed on June 18, 1962. Noah v. United States, 304 F.2d 317. In the prosecution of that appeal petitioner was represented by counsel.</p>\n<p id=\"b212-12\">On February 28, 1963, petitioner filed in this court in <em>pro. per. </em>what he describes as \u201cPetition for a Writ of Error.\u201d The opinion of this court in Noah v. United States, supra, determined adversely to petitioner the first four points set out by petitioner in this proceeding.</p>\n<p id=\"b212-18\">In Point No. V, appellant alleges \u201ca prejudicial error was committed by this court because of the presence of the Honorable William T. Beeks, District Court Judge, sitting as a member of this tribunal. An indictment, Criminal No. 50460 was issued in the Western District of Washington, U. S. District Court, charging the Appellant and seven (7) other persons with conspiring to violate U. S. Narcotics Laws. The indictment is petitioner\u2019s Exhibit \u2018A\u2019. The indictment was returned to the Court of the Honorable Judge Beeks.\u201d</p>\n<p id=\"b212-19\">In Point V petitioner may be trying to raise an issue under sections 47 or 455 of Title 28 U.S.C.<footnotemark>1</footnotemark> We have examined the district court record in case No. 50460 referred to by petitioner. It shows that petitioner was never tried in that case and that the indictment as to petitioner was dismissed by Judge Beeks on the motion of the United States Attorney on August 27, 1962. It thus appears that in the determination of petitioner\u2019s appeal from his judgment of conviction, Judge Beeks was not called upon to \u201chear or determine an appeal from the decision of a case or issue tried by him.\u201d The record fails to disclose anything that would indicate that Judge Beeks was in any way disqualified by the provisions of either section 47 or section 455, Title 28 U.S.C.</p>\n<p id=\"b212-20\">Treating the present petition either as one for a \u201cwrit of error\u201d or \u201cto recall the mandate of the court\u201d or one of \u201ccoram nobis\u201d or as a petition for a rehearing, petitioner is entitled to no relief.</p>\n<p id=\"AU2\">The petition is denied.</p>\n<footnote label=\"1\">\n<p id=\"b212-13\">. \u201c\u00a7 47.
