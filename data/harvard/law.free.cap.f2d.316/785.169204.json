As evidence of appellant\u2019s initial deportation, the government offered the Warrant of Deportation, endorsed as having been executed. Appellant objected to the admission of the document on the ground that in reciting the basis for appellant\u2019s deportation the warrant disclosed that appellant had been convicted of illegal possession of a narcotic drug (see 8 U.S.C.A. \u00a7 1251 (a) (11)) \u2014 a crime unrelated to that for which appellant was then being tried. The objection was overruled. The government later introduced, without objection, a statement signed by appellant admitting in detail commission of the offense charged under 8 U.S.C.A. \u00a7 1326, which also included a recitation of the prior narcotics conviction. The admission of these two references to the prior conviction is the sole basis of the present appeal.</p>\n<p id=\"b838-8\">We will assume that the admission of these references was error. We also recognize \u201cthat admission of such material is treated as obviously prejudicial and admonitory instructions are commonly considered inefficacious.\u201d Thurman v. United States, 9th Cir., 1963, 316 F.2d 205, 206. Nonetheless, we conclude that in the circumstances of this case appellant\u2019s \u201csubstantial rights\u201d were not affected. Fed.R.Crim. P. 52(a).</p>\n<p id=\"b838-10\">Appellant\u2019s sole defense was that he may have been naturalized during his service in the Armed Forces of the United States. It was undisputed that appellant was admitted to the United States as an alien on March 9, 1954. It was admitted that he was an alien when inducted into the Armed Forces on November 8, 1955. He was honorably discharged on August 12, 1957. He testified that while in the armed service, before embarking for overseas duty, he and other non-citizens in his unit were asked to sign \u201csome kind of papers.\u201d He did not read or understand English well at the time and did not know what the papers were, and, specifically, did not know whether they were an application for citizenship. He further testified that he had made no application for naturalization on any other occasion. A document issued to appellant at the time of his discharge had a typewritten \u201cX\u201d in the block marked \u201cyes\u201d following the heading \u201cU.S. Citizen.\u201d The government introduced various other official records indicating that appellant was an alien at all pertinent times and had not been naturalized, and presented oral testimony to show how error might have occurred in completing the blanks in the discharge document.</p>\n<p id=\"b838-11\">The jury was instructed that appellant could not have met the requirements for naturalization unless he had (1) resided continuously in the United States for five years (8 U.S.C.A. \u00a7 1427(a)), or (2) served honorably in the Armed Forces of the United States for three years (8 U.S.C.A. \u00a7 1439(a)), or (3) served honorably in an active duty status during the period between June 25, 1950, and July 1, 1955 (8 U.S.C.A. \u00a7 1440). Appellant has not challenged the accuracy of those instructions in this court.</p>\n<p id=\"b838-12\">On the basis of the instructions the evidence of appellant\u2019s guilt was more than overwhelming; it was conclusive. It was undisputed that: (1) appellant had resided in the United States only <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"787\">*787</page-number>three years and four months at the time of his discharge from the Armed Forces; (2) he served in the Armed Forces only twenty-one months; and (3) he was not inducted until after July 1, 1955. Since there was no rational basis upon which the jury could have reached any verdict but that of guilty, the error complained of could not have affected appellant\u2019s substantial rights. See Lutwak v. United States, 344 U.S. 604, 619-620, 73 S.Ct. 481, 97 L.Ed. 593 (1953); Kotteakos v. United States, 328 U.S. 750, 764-765, 66 S.Ct. 1239, 90 L.Ed. 1557 (1946); Sawyer v. United States, 112 U.S.App.D.C. 381, 303 F.2d 392, 395 (1962); Homan v. United States, 279 F.2d 767, 773 (8th Cir., 1960); United States v. Sheba Bracelets, 248 F.2d 134, 144-145 (2d Cir., 1957); United States v. Spadafora, 181 F.2d 957, 959 (7th Cir., 1950).</p>\n<p id=\"b839-4\">Finally, although it would not be curative if possible prejudice otherwise appeared, we should in fairness note that the government sought to minimize the adverse effect of the references to appellant\u2019s prior conviction. Government counsel omitted any reference to it in reading the Warrant of Deportation to the jury and made no mention of the matter in cross-examination of appellant or at any other time during trial prior to summation. It was referred to in government counsel\u2019s closing argument only to emphasize the limited purpose for which the documents containing the references were to be considered by the jury.<footnotemark>*</footnotemark></p>\n<p id=\"b839-5\">Affirmed.</p>\n<footnote label=\"*\">\n<p id=\"b839-6\"> The references by government counsel were as follows:</p>\n<blockquote id=\"A5yT\">\u201cThe Warrant of Deportation reads on its face \u2018alien\u2019 and also recites the crime of which he was convicted. You are not here to determine whether or not he was guilty of that crime or whether or not he should be guilty of the crime charged in this indictment because he may or may not have been guilty of a crime in I960. That is not before you for concern. The only reason that Warrant of Deportation was put in evidence by the Government is to show that the man was deported.\u201d</blockquote>\n<p id=\"Avf\">And with respect to the confession:</p>\n<blockquote id=\"AWLG\">\u201cWe are not looking to see if the man\u2019s character or morals are good or bad, and for all intents and purposes the Government would submit that this man\u2019s moral character is fine. We are not trying him \u2014the evidence isn\u2019t being submitted to you for any other purpose than to prove the charges in the indictment that were read to you at the outset of this trial, and that is that the defendant was arrested and deported from the United States in 1960.\u201d</blockquote>\n</footnote>\n</opinion>\n</casebody>\n",
