Appellant, John T. Handy Co., Inc., appeals from a verdict rendered by a jury in the Circuit Court for Somerset County in which James Carman, Ward and Wade Walker, and Jack Howard, appellees and Crisfield crabbers,<footnotemark>1</footnotemark> were awarded $78,850 in damages. The cause of action arose out of, and damages were awarded in respect to, the alleged negligence and/or breach of contract by appellant in <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"191\">*191</page-number>failing to keep shedding shanties operating in a proper fashion causing the deaths of tens of thousands of peelers, busters and, presumably, soft crabs.</p>\n<p id=\"b221-5\">Before proceeding to appellant\u2019s questions, a rudimentary understanding of the soft shell crab process may be helpful. We will identify some of the stages and types of crabs, first noting that shedding is a vital part of the reproduction process, <em>i.e., </em>mating occurs during the female crab\u2019s soft shell stage and males, being caring and attentive creatures, grab, restrain and enclose the females and thus protect them during the peeler, buster, and vulnerable soft shell stages.<footnotemark>2</footnotemark></p>\n<p id=\"b221-6\">Peelers are hard crabs thinking about shedding. They are distinguished by colorations. Busters have gone further than thinking about it; they are literally \u201cbusting\u201d at the seams. Soft crabs have \u201cbusted\u201d out or shed their hard shells and their new shells have not yet begun to harden. Paper shells (buckrams) represent an intermediate stage, after the soft shell of the crab has begun to harden from the minerals in the water. Paper shells have little marketable value, though it is not uncommon for them to be eaten. The last stage is the return to the hard crab stage. There is a brief period during which time the soft crab must be removed from water, after the buster has completed the process of busting out, so it does not transmogrify into a paper shell and become a hard crab once again.</p>\n<p id=\"b221-7\">In order to monitor the process, female peelers are caught in open water, often enticed by hardshell male \u201cJimmy\u201d crabs,<footnotemark>3</footnotemark> and transferred to floats (usually, now in shanties) <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"192\">*192</page-number>where fresh salt water is continually pumped in (or, in some instances, naturally passes through floats that are anchored in waterways). This keeps the crabs alive as they pass through the various stages of the shed. During this process, the crabs (1,000 to 1,200 a float) require constant monitoring (tending) so that the soft shells may be immediately removed (fished) from the water in order to keep them in a soft state and to otherwise protect them from predation by other crabs.</p>\n<p id=\"A7A\">Appellant presents five questions:</p>\n<blockquote id=\"b222-5\">1. Did the Trial Court commit reversible error by instructing the Jury on the law of bailments?</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b222-6\">2. Even if it was not erroneous for the Trial Court to have instructed the Jury on the law of bailments, was it reversible error not to also give the requested instruction that before the theory of bailment could be considered, the Jury must first find that the crabs had been delivered to John T. Handy Co., Inc., which thereafter had exclusive control of the crabs at the time of the alleged loss of crabs?</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b222-7\">3. Did the Trial Court commit reversible error when, over objection, it admitted evidence of a compromise and settlement of a disputed claim in 1988 offered to show that <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"193\">*193</page-number>the intention of the parties in 1991 was that John T. Handy Co., Inc. would pay such claims?</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b223-4\">4. Did the Trial Court commit reversible error when, over objection, it admitted into evidence the 1992 agreement between John T. Handy Co., Inc. and other crabbers to show the intent of the parties in 1991, where the 1992 agreement had been materially changed from 1991 to address the problems which had arisen with the Plaintiff Crabbers in 1991?</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b223-5\">5. Did the Trial Court commit reversible error when, over objection, it permitted the Plaintiff Crabbers to appeal to the ethnic and racial biases of the Jurors by blaming the uninvolved Japanese owners of John T. Handy Co., Inc. for the problems alleged?</blockquote>\n<p id=\"b223-6\">We shall address these questions as necessary. First, however, we shall note certain facts pertinent to our inquiry.</p>\n<p id=\"b223-7\">Facts</p>\n<p id=\"b223-8\">Appellant is a soft crab processor, <em>ie., </em>it is in the business of purchasing and processing soft crabs that it receives live (or \u201cstill\u201d) from crabbers, and then reselling the processed crabs, frozen or alive. The shedding season runs roughly from May through September. One of, it' not the major, \u201cruns\u201d of soft shells occurs in the mid-May to early June period.</p>\n<p id=\"b223-9\">In earlier days of the industry, and to some extent even today, shedding was done by the crabbers in individual shanties or numerous floats actually situated in bay waters where the persons tending the floats would do so by way of catwalks over the water or from boats. Because of the necessity to \u201ctend\u201d the floats around the clock, they were luminated. It was not at all unusual to see strings of low intensity lights strung out over the water of many of the creeks, harbors, and crabbing centers of the lower shore.</p>\n<p id=\"b223-10\">Relatively recently, however, processors, such as appellant and others, began to construct \u201cfloats\u201d that were not floated but, rather, were constructed out of the water and compart<page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"194\">*194</page-number>mentalized in shanties,<footnotemark>4</footnotemark> some containing scores of individual floats and most with a capacity of 1,000 to 1,200 crabs per float. Water is then pumped from the water source to the floats in a continual cycle to provide fresh salt water and, thus, oxygen in which the peelers and busters, are placed to complete the cycle to soft crab stage. A denial of water, or a breakdown in the pumping system, can cause massive kills, which is what allegedly occurred in the case <em>sub judice. </em>Some shanties that processors provide are rented out to crabbers who must provide their own pumps and water supply system to the leased floats. Other shanties, including the ones at issue here, are rented to the crabbers under arrangements that require the lessor, appellant here, to provide the water system to the shanties and floats. Under either type of arrangement, the processor\u2019s primary purpose is. to have a ready supply of soft crabs available for purchasing, processing, and resale. Some arrangements,<footnotemark>5</footnotemark> including those at issue here, require the crabbers to sell all of the marketable crabs shed in the shanties and floats rented from the processor to that processor. If the crabber does not do so, the arrangements require that the crabbers vacate the premises.<footnotemark>6</footnotemark></p>\n<p id=\"b224-5\">Additionally, as part of the interaction between processors and \u201cits\u201d watermen,<footnotemark>7</footnotemark> the processors regularly lend start up money to the watermen for new pots, repairs, etc., at the beginning of the season. The loans and the rental payments for the shanties and floats are deducted from the sums due the <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"195\">*195</page-number>watermen for the soft shells sold to the processor. Sales culminate when the soft shells are delivered to the processor\u2019s \u201cdock\u201d throughout each day as they are removed from the floats. They are immediately placed in coolers to await further processing. A system of tickets has been devised to keep track of the source of the soft shells received.</p>\n<p id=\"b225-5\">In the case at bar, appellant paid the watermen once weekly, on Friday or Saturday, for soft shells delivered throughout the week. The price was set each Friday or Saturday solely by appellant for all the soft shells sold during the preceding week. The sums borrowed and rental sums due for shanty and float rental were then deducted from the amounts due according to a formula based upon previous year\u2019s catch records and other factors.</p>\n<p id=\"b225-6\">In the case <em>mb judice, </em>appellees filed suit claiming that appellant\u2019s water provision system had become inoperative, resulting in the premature death of most of the crabs in the floats. Appellee Howard offered evidence that at the time of the problem, he had between 80,000 and 96,000 crabs in his floats.<footnotemark>8</footnotemark> He was able to salvage \u201c406 dozen crabs (4,872).\u201d Appellee Carman had \u201c76,800 crabs\u201d in his floats and was able to salvage 7,346. The Walkers had between 56,000 and 72,000 crabs. They salvaged 6,744 crabs. After further allowances were made for normal mortality losses, the jury awarded damages to each appellant, apparently based upon an average price paid the watermen of $.50 per crab. Based upon the figures they presented to the jury, appellees claimed that Mr. Howard was entitled to damages in excess of $45,000; Mr. Carman was entitled to damages in excess of $32,800, and the Walkers to damages in excess of $30,000. Howard received an award of $30,000; Carman $26,500, and the Walkers $22,600. <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"196\">*196</page-number>None of the parties has appealed the amount of damages the jury awarded to the respective appellees.</p>\n<p id=\"b226-5\">At the conclusion of the evidentiary stage, the trial judge presented copies of the special verdict sheet he proposed to furnish the jury to each party. Appellant\u2019s attorney responded, \u201cIt looks fine just the way it is.\u201d</p>\n<p id=\"b226-6\">The parties did not designate or include that verdict sheet in the extract. The record includes at least two special verdict sheets. However, the completed verdict sheet contained in the record, which we presume was the one presented to the jury, provides as follows:</p>\n<p id=\"b226-7\">SPECIAL VERDICT SHEET</p>\n<blockquote id=\"b226-8\">1. Do you find for the Plaintiff, James Carman?</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b226-9\">Yes x No _</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b226-10\">2. If you find for the Plaintiff, James Carman, what if any, damages do you award?</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b226-12\">$26,250.00</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b226-13\">3. Do you find for the Plaintiffs, Wade Walker and Ward Walker?</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b226-15\">Yes x No</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b226-16\">4. If you find for the Plaintiffs, Wade Walker and Ward Walker, what if any, damages do you award?.</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b226-18\">$22,600.00</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b226-19\">5. Do you find for the Plaintiff, Jack Howard?</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b226-20\">Yes x No _</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b226-21\">6. If you find for the Plaintiff, Jack Howard, what if any, damages do you award?</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b226-23\">$30,000.00</blockquote>\n<p id=\"b226-24\">From the verdict sheet, there is no way to determine whether the jury\u2019s verdicts were based on bailment principles, negligence principles, or contract, <em>i.e., </em>lessorfiessee breach of contract principles.</p>\n<p id=\"b227-4\"><page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"197\">*197</page-number>Prior to submitting the case to the jury, the trial judge gave his charge. His instructions included an instruction on bailment that appellant asserts was in error:</p>\n<blockquote id=\"b227-5\">Bailment is the delivery and acceptance or obtaining of possession of property for a particular purpose without transfer of ownership. The bailor is the party who delivers the property. The bailee is the party who receives or has possession of the property and is required to return the property when the purpose for the delivery or obtaining possession is accomplished.</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b227-6\">A bailment for hire is one from which both the bailor and the bailee benefit. To recover damages, the bailor must prove that a bailment for hire existed and that the bailee did not return the property in the condition it was when received, ordinary wear and tear excepted. Even though the bailee shows that the loss resulted from an alleged accident or action beyond his or her control, the bailor may, nevertheless, recover if the alleged accident or action beyond the bailee\u2019s control could have been avoided by the bailee\u2019s use of reasonable care. The bailor has the burden of proving that the loss could have been avoided had the bailee exercised reasonable care over the property.</blockquote>\n<p id=\"b227-7\">At the conclusion of the trial court\u2019s charge, appellant\u2019s counsel approached the bench and stated:</p>\n<blockquote id=\"b227-8\">Your Honor, as you know, my exceptions are to all of the instructions with regard to bailment. My basic position is this. The concept of bailment is one which arises in the law to permit parties who have turned over the exclusive control of property to another party, called a bailee, to recover by shifting the burden or the burden of going forward to the party, the bailee, to prove that they were not negligent if the property was damaged by the time the bailor got the property back.</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b227-9\">In order to accomplish that, I believe all the case law on bailment is confusing in some respects. But I believe it is crystal clear on this point, as illustrated by Broadview Apartments, that where the control of the property that is <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"198\">*198</page-number>subject to the bailment is not subject to\u2014has not been delivered to the exclusive control of the bailee, then it cannot be a bailment.</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b228-5\">And so, for that reason, I except to all of the instructions that bring bailment into issue. I think it\u2019s simply going to confuse the jury on an issue which is not in this case, because the evidence is clear that the crabbers put the crabs in, the crabbers tended them while they were in the floats, the crabbers took them out, and the only time that Handy got the exclusive control of that property was when it was sold to them as a soft crab. The only reason that Handy had any access at all to their premises was solely for maintenance purposes.</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b228-6\">Even, I would go one step further, however, with the exception. Even with respect to the bailment instructions given, they do not include an instruction which I had included within my earlier summation, where I had included bailment before all the evidence was in, which makes it clear that the jury has to decide whether or not the property was subject to the control of the bailee, in this case Handy, since the jury is not even aware that that is an issue they have to determine. It suggests to them that\u2014it could suggest to them, certainly, that there is a bailment here where there is, at the very minimum, a factual dispute and, of course, I don\u2019t believe it\u2019s even a factual dispute.</blockquote>\n<p id=\"b228-7\">Those are my exceptions, Your Honor.</p>\n<p id=\"b228-8\">Question 1. Did the Trial Court commit reversible error by instructing the Jury on the law of bailments?</p>\n<p id=\"b228-9\">We have exhaustively reviewed the evidence presented at trial and can come to no other conclusion but that no bailment of the type suggested by the appellees possibly existed under the facts of this case.<footnotemark>9</footnotemark> It was, thus, error for the trial court to instruct the jury on bailment. It was prejudicial error in that it, in and of itself, created for appel<page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"199\">*199</page-number>lees a <em>prima facie </em>case and shifted the initial burden to appellant to establish a lack of its negligence. Moreover, because of the special verdict sheet used and the bailment instruction given, we are unable to determine whether the jury rendered its verdict because the crabs somehow were not returned in satisfactory condition to appellees (bailment) or because it found appellant negligent, or because it found that appellant had breached its duties under the lease. If based solely upon a failure to return the crabs, the verdict would not be supported by the evidence adduced. We shall, however, remand the case for retrial because there existed sufficient evidence for the submission to the jury of the causes of action in breach of contract, and, perhaps, even in negligence, as the damages claimed might be, under <em>A.J. Decoster Co. v. Westinghouse Electric Corp., </em>333 Md. 245, 634 A.2d 1330 (1994), considered damages to the property of appellant.<footnotemark>10</footnotemark></p>\n<p id=\"b229-4\">We shall first address the general law of bailments. The early types of bailments were divided into five classes:</p>\n<blockquote id=\"Aj8\">(1) depositum, (2) mandatum, (3) commodatum, (4) pignori acceptum, or vadium, and (5) locatum.</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b229-5\">Depositum.\u2014Depositum, or a deposit, is a naked bailment, without reward, of goods to be kept for the bailor, by one usually called a depositary. Custody, as opposed to service, is said to be the chief purpose thereof. But there is a large class of deposits in which there is no actual delivery to keep and no actual agreement to accept the goods or to keep or take care of them, and the contract of the depositary is implied from the nature of the transaction or occurrence by which the property comes into the hands of one not the owner, and from the principles of equity and justice that ought to govern the conduct of men toward each other.</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b229-6\">Mandatum.\u2014Mandatum, a mandate or commission, may be defined as a bailment of goods without recompense, where the mandatary, or person to whom the property is <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"200\">*200</page-number>delivered, undertakes to do some act with respect to the thing bailed, as simply to carry it. It is a bailment of something for mere gratuitous service on it by the bailee.</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b230-5\">Commodatum.\u2014A commodatum consists in the gratuitous lending of personal property to be used by the bailee and returned in specie.</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b230-6\"><em>Pignori Acceptum or </em>Pignus.\u2014Pignori acceptum, or pig-nus, sometimes called vadium, and, in English, a pawn or a pledge, occurs when goods or chattels are delivered to another in pledge, to be security to him for money borrowed or another engagement entered into with him by the bailor.</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b230-7\">Locatum.\u2014Locatum, sometimes designated as locatio et conductio, or a hiring, arises when goods are left with the bailee for some use or service by him, and is always for some reward. This species of bailment has been subdivided as follows: (1) locatio rei, or the hire of a thing, whereby the hirer gains its temporary use; (2) locatio operis faciendi, or the hiring of work or labor on a thing; (3) locatio custodiae, or the hiring of care and pains, or services, to be performed or bestowed on the thing delivered; and (4) locatio operis, mercium vehendarum, or the hiring of the carriage of goods, when they are bailed, either to a public carrier or to a private person for the purpose of being carried from place to place.</blockquote>\n<p id=\"b230-8\">8 Am.Jur.2d <em>Bailments </em>\u00a7 16 (1980) (footnotes omitted).</p>\n<p id=\"b230-9\">Modern usage, however, divides bailments into three types:</p>\n<blockquote id=\"b230-11\">(1) for the sole benefit of the bailor; (2) for the sole benefit of the bailee; and (3) for the mutual benefit of both. This modern classification is comprehensive and includes every kind of bailment. Under it the old Roman divisions group themselves readily. Thus, in the first class-bailments for the bailor\u2019s benefit-come depositum and mandatum. Commodatum is embraced by the second class, as it is a bailment for the bailee\u2019s sole benefit. And the third class, bailments for the mutual benefit of both parties, comprises <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"201\">*201</page-number>locatum, with its subdivisions, and pignori acceptum or vadium.</blockquote>\n<p id=\"b231-4\">8 Am.Jur.2d <em>Bailments </em>\u00a7 17 (1980).</p>\n<p id=\"b231-5\">In the case <em>sub judice, </em>a bailment, <em>if any exists, </em>would come under the third modern classification, <em>ie., </em>a bailment for the mutual benefit of both. Thus, it is our function to determine whether, based upon the facts of this case, a bailment existed in the first instance.</p>\n<p id=\"b231-6\">The Court of Appeals discussed one of the definitions of a bailment in <em>General Refining Co. v. International Harvester Co., </em>173 Md. 404, 414-15, 196 A. 131 (1938):</p>\n<blockquote id=\"b231-7\">A bailment is said, in <em>Dobie on Bailment and Carriers, </em>to be: \u201cThe relation created <em>through the transfer of the possession </em>of goods or chattels, by a person called the bailor to a person called the bailee, without a transfer of ownership, for the accomplishment of a certain purpose, whereupon the goods or chattels are to be dealt with according to the instructions of the bailor.\u201d Other definitions cited by Dobie are these: \u201cBailment is defined by Sir William Jones <em>{Jones, Bailments, </em>1) <em>as being a delivery of goods </em>in trust, on a contract, express or implied, that the trust shall be duly executed, <em>and the goods redelivered </em>as soon as the time or use for which they were bailed shall have elapsed or been performed. According to Judge Story <em>{Story, Bailments, </em>ch. 1, sec. 2) a <em>bailment is \u2018a delivery of a thing </em>in trust, for some special object or purpose, and upon a contract, express or implied, to conform to the object or purpose of the trust.\u2019 In <em>Kent\u2019s Commentaries </em>(2 Kent, Comm. [4th Ed.] sec. 40, p. 558) a bailment is said to be \u2018a <em>delivery of goods on trust, </em>upon a contract, express or implied, that the trust shall be duly executed, <em>and the goods restored by the bailee, </em>as soon as the purpose of the bailment shall be answered.\u2019 \u201d</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b231-8\">To constitute a bailment there must be an existing subject-matter, a contract with reference to it <em>which involves possession of it by the bailee, delivery, </em>actual or construe<page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"202\">*202</page-number>tive, and acceptance, actual or constructive. 6 <em>Amer.Juris. </em>190 <em>et seq. </em>[Emphasis added.]</blockquote>\n<p id=\"b232-5\">The effect of a mutual bailment, if one exists, is that upon a mere showing that the item bailed has not been returned, then</p>\n<blockquote id=\"b232-6\">in such case, [where] a demand and an unexplained refusal to [re]deliver are proven, a <em>prima facie </em>case of negligence is made out; yet, when the loss ... is ... occasioned by a cause which would excuse the bailee, ... then the defense is complete, unless the bailor follows by showing that the bailee, by the exercise of ordinary care and diligence might have avoided the loss or injury.</blockquote>\n<p id=\"b232-7\"><em>Fox Chevrolet Sales, Inc. v. Middleton, </em>203 Md. 158, 161, 99 A.2d 731 (1953). <em>See also Charles J. Miller, Inc. v. McClung-Logan Equip. Co., </em>40 Md.App. 585, 392 A.2d 1153 (1978), where the late Judge Liss, for the Court, discussed the historical origins of the law of bailments and condensed the body of a law to its simplest components.</p>\n<blockquote id=\"b232-8\">The law of bailments is ancient\u2014extending back to Biblical times and before. The Biblical law of bailments, as so many other facets of the law, filtered through the ecclesiastical courts into the common law and was adopted here in Maryland. It is amazing how little change has occurred in the law of bailments over the intervening centuries since the time of Moses. In a long series of cases factually similar to the case at bar, Maryland has stated the controlling principles of bailment law: when the subject matter of a mutual bailment for hire <em>is delivered by the bailor to the bailee, it must be returned by </em>the bailee in substantially the same condition ordinary wear and tear excepted. When the bailed chattel is <em>either not returned or returned in a damaged condition </em>without legal excuse, a prima facie case of lack of due care or negligence is made out. It is then the duty of the bailee to go forward with proof that the loss or injury was occasioned by a cause which excuses the bailee, thereby providing a complete defense as the bailee is not an insurer. The bailor is then, by reason of his burden of <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"203\">*203</page-number>proof, required to overcome this defense by establishing by a preponderance of the evidence that the bailee failed to use ordinary care and diligence to safeguard the bailor\u2019s property, and that failure to perform his duty caused the loss to the bailor.</blockquote>\n<p id=\"b233-5\"><em>Id. </em>at 588, 392 A.2d 1153 (emphasis added, footnote omitted). <em>See also Stehle Equip.

The company argued: \u201c[T]he meter and its connections are its property ... the law gives to it the sole control and management ... and that ... [no one] has the right to disturb or interfere with the meter ... without [its] consent....\u201d <em>Id. </em>at 744, 43 A. 817. Blondell argued that the placement of the meter constituted a bailment with the property owners and that, as bailees, they had the right to \u201cuse them for any reasonable purpose.\u201d The Court responded: \u201cIt is apparent ... that the apparatus ... is not <em>delivered </em>to the consumer for any purpose whatever. It is true, it is \u201cplaced\u201d ... <em>for the purpose of measuring the gas </em>consumed.... In order to effect a bailment <em>there must he a delivery </em>either real or constructive.

At trial, Broadview rested its case without putting on any evidence, asserting that the plaintiff failed to establish that the car in issue had been delivered to it, and, thus, it was not the bailee of the car. The trial court <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"204\">*204</page-number>did not agree and held Broadview to be the bailee. We noted the importance of the bailment issue at 152-54, 350 A.2d 707:</p>\n<blockquote id=\"A1\">[I]t is readily apparent that the answer to the threshold question of whether a bailment exists will have not only a procedural but often times a substantive impact on the outcome of the case. If no bailment is shown, and the owner of the property is a mere licensee or lessee of the storage space, then in order to recover against the defendant garage owner the plaintiff would have to prove specific acts of negligence on the part of the defendant proximately \u25a0causing loss or injury of plaintiff's property. Absent a bailor-bailee relationship, the plaintiff would not have the benefit of any inference or presumption of negligence that arises from a <em>mere showing of non-return of </em>his property if that relationship existed.</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b234-4\">In the instant case we think the evidence is legally insufficient to establish that a bailor-bailee relationship existed. Appellee merely rented a parking space monthly; he parked his own car, locked the car and took the keys with him. There was no testimony that Broadview had a set of keys for the car or had any right or authority to move or exercise any control over the car. The parking garage was laid out in such a manner that it was possible for appellee to park his car without any attendant even being aware of his presence in the garage. Appellee entered into the monthly lease arrangement with full knowledge of how the garage operated. He was not required to check his car in or out, and there was no evidence whatsoever that control of the car was ever turned over to the operators of the garage, or that they ever accepted delivery or control. Nor was there any evidence that Broadview expressly contracted or asserted that the car would be safe from theft while in the garage. [Emphasis added, footnotes omitted.]</blockquote>\n<p id=\"b234-5\">Similarly, in the case at bar, according to the letter agreement and pursuant to the evidence adduced at trial, appellees merely rented a shanty and its floats on a seasonal basis, the peelers were placed in the floats by the appellees and were <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"205\">*205</page-number>tended by the appellees, and the soft crabs and dead crabs were \u201cfished\u201d out by the appellees. During that entire process, the crabs, in whatever stage, were in the possession of appellees. Appellant had no right to use the floats, once rented to appellees, for any purpose other than maintenance without first contacting the appellees. Nor did appellant have any right to exercise control at any stage of the tending process. Moreover, the appellees did not check in with appellant prior to entering the shanties, but had their own keys, and came and went as they chose without appellant necessarily having any knowledge that they were there. Appellees had full knowledge of the letter agreement or arrangement. More importantly, there was absolutely no evidence of any delivery of any crabs until the soft crabs had been removed from the floats and shanties and delivered to appellant at another location\u2014\u201cthe dock.\u201d Moreover, under the arrangement here, of which appellees had full knowledge, the soft crabs, once delivered to appellant, were not intended to be returned to appellees. There was, thus, never any delivery to, or possession by, appellant prior to the transfer of the soft shells to appellant\u2019s dock. Even then, there was never any intention by either party that the soft shells would be returned to appellees. At that point, appellant got the soft shells and appellees got money\u2014that is a buy-sell arrangement.</p>\n<p id=\"b235-4\">The letter document clearly supports this as a non-bailment arrangement. It provides:</p>\n<blockquote id=\"b235-5\">HANDY SOFT SHELL CRABS</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b235-6\">April 29, 1991</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b235-7\">Another soft crab season is almost here.

We do not want to cause you any problems because of a situation that you have not created. Therefore, we will supply you with a certain number of boxes free at the beginning of each season (the number of boxes will be determined by the number of crabs you brought us last year). Every time you bring us crabs, <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"210\">*210</page-number>we will give you exactly the same number of boxes you bring us.</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b240-4\">This should work all season and you should have no problems. If for some reason, you need more boxes than we have given you, we will have to charge for them. The charge will be $4.50 per box. This is our cost. [Emphasis added.]</blockquote>\n<p id=\"b240-5\">The evidence is uncontradicted that no delivery of soft crabs (or any crabs) to appellant was ever intended prior to the time appellees <em>delivered and sold </em>the soft crabs to appellant and, when doing so, delivered them to appellant at \u201cthe dock\u201d after the shedding process was completed and the soft crabs were removed from the shanties. Until that time, appellant did not possess any of the soft shells or exert any control over the shedding process. It is equally clear that, once the soft crabs were sold and delivered to appellant, they were not intended to be returned to appellees. The mere existence of a leasing arrangement whereby crabbers lease shanties in which they shed <em>their </em>crabs and ultimately remove them for later sale to a processor, after which there is no intention that the crabs ever be returned to the watermen, is not changed to a bailment because the processor is the entity that leased the shanty to the crabber. While such an arrangement may well create relationships giving rise to other contractual and/or tortious causes of action, it does not create a bailment.</p>\n<p id=\"b240-6\">Neither the letter nor the other evidence presented at trial was sufficient to present the issue of bailment to the jury. We hold in the case <em>sub judice, </em>as we did in <em>Broadview, </em>that</p>\n<blockquote id=\"A7O\">there is insufficient evidence to warrant a finding of a bailor-bailee relationship between the parties. The trial court was wrong in finding there was such a relationship. There being no bailment, the burden was upon the plaintiff below (appellee here) to produce sufficient evidence of specific acts of negligence on the part of [Handy] or its employees (unaided by any inference of negligence from the fact that the ... [crabs died]) from which the trier of fact could predicate a judgment in [their] favor.</blockquote>\n<p id=\"b241-4\"><page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"211\">*211</page-number><em>Id. </em>at 155, 350 A.2d 707. <em>See also Commodities Reserve Corp. v.

Warner, <em>Beautiful Swimmers: Watermen, Crabs and the Chesapeake Bay, </em>136-37 (1976). Once a female becomes sexually mature and mates it is believed that she no longer moults or sheds. It is during this last shed to sexual maturity that the female\u2019s apron changes from v-shaped to circular and mating occurs. Thereafter, females are known as \u201csooks.\u201d \"Sooks\u201d spawn generally the following spring or summer, and then are believed to go to sea to die.</p>\n<p id=\"b222-10\">\"Jimmy\u201d crabbing is distinguishable from \"Jimmy\u201d potting and refers to a Smith Island practice of tying a line around one of a Jimmy crab's swimming legs, returning it to the water where it grabs female peeler crabs that it has enticed. The courting crabs are then pulled in reach of a net and netted, with the Jimmy crab being returned to the water to grab other females. As Captain Kitchy noted, \"I remember one Jimmy I had on the line ... he caught seven wives just as fast as he could get them.... [A]ll of a sudden he wouldn\u2019t catch any more.
