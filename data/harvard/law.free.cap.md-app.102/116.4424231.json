Brandis and Jo Ann K. Marsh (Marshes), appeal from an Order of the Circuit Court for St. Mary\u2019s County (Raley, J.) granting the motion of appellee, Loffler Housing Corporation (Loffler), to modify an arbitrator\u2019s award in a contract dispute so as to include costs and attorneys\u2019 fees.<footnotemark>1</footnotemark> We have re-ordered appellants\u2019 issues as follows:</p>\n<p id=\"b149-10\">\n<em>Issues</em>\n</p>\n<blockquote id=\"b149-11\">I. Did the lower court have the authority to award Loffler attorneys\u2019 fees where the Uniform Arbitration Act authorizes attorneys\u2019 fees only if so provided in the arbitration agreement between the parties?</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b149-12\">II. Did the lower court have authority to modify the arbitrator\u2019s award to reallocate the costs of the arbitration and to include attorneys\u2019 fees incurred by Loffler where none of the three enumerated bases set forth in the Uniform Arbitration Act for modification of an award by a court were satisfied by the facts of this case?</blockquote>\n<p id=\"b150-3\">\n<page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"120\">*120</page-number>\n<em>Facts</em>\n</p>\n<p id=\"b150-4\">In September 1988, appellants purchased a three-story house on Knight Road, Leonardtown, Maryland in St. Mary\u2019s County. Appellants decided to renovate and expand their house, and solicited bids from various contractors for the renovation. Appellants ultimately selected appellee to serve as general contractor on the project.</p>\n<p id=\"b150-5\">On 4 October 1989, appellants and appellee entered into an American Institute of Architects (AIA) standard construction contract (AIA Contract), with the attendant AIA General Conditions of the Contract for Construction (General Conditions). Article 16.1.7 of the AIA Contract, entitled \u201cOther Documents, if any, forming part of the Contract Documents are as follows:\u201d, provided:</p>\n<blockquote id=\"b150-6\">It is agreed that the documents listed below and attached to this contract routinely used by Loffler Housing Corporation, shall be executed by the appropriate respective parties to this agreement and shall become part of this agreement. Where there are conflicts between this document and those listed below, this document shall supersede those listed below....</blockquote>\n<p id=\"b150-7\">The first document listed and attached was the Home Improvement Contract, duly signed and executed by appellants at the same time as the AIA Contract. The Home Improvement Contract provided, in pertinent part, that:</p>\n<blockquote id=\"b150-8\">In the event that payment under this contract is enforced through legal action, or other collection action, homeowner agrees to pay contractor\u2019s costs and attorney\u2019s fees related to said action.</blockquote>\n<p id=\"b150-9\">Article 4.5 of the General Conditions set forth the agreement to arbitrate any dispute arising out of or relating to the AIA Contract. It stated:</p>\n<blockquote id=\"b150-10\">Any controversy or claim arising out of or related to the contract, or the breach thereof, shall be settled by arbitration in accordance with the Construction Industry Arbitration Rules of the American Arbitration Association....</blockquote>\n<p id=\"b151-4\"><page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"121\">*121</page-number>Paragraph six of the Construction Industry Arbitration Rules (Rules) in effect at the time the contract was executed stated that the initiating party shall provide written notice setting forth the nature of the dispute to the other party. Paragraph eight explained that once a claim is filed, any new or different claims or counterclaims shall also be made in writing.</p>\n<p id=\"b151-5\">Once the contract was executed, appellee began construction on appellants\u2019 home. Subsequently, a dispute developed regarding the final three payments remaining to be made by appellants to appellee pursuant to the AIA Contract. On 15 April 1992, appellee filed a mechanic\u2019s lien petition in the circuit court against appellants\u2019 property, seeking $3993.38, plus interest. In response, appellants, among other things, filed a petition for arbitration based on the arbitration clause in the General Conditions. On 22 May 1992, the circuit court stayed the mechanic\u2019s lien action and ordered the parties to arbitrate their dispute.</p>\n<p id=\"b151-6\">In July 1992, appellants filed a written claim against appellee with the American Arbitration Association (AAA) alleging that appellee performed defective workmanship and requested improper and excessive charges for the work performed.<footnotemark>2</footnotemark> Appellants requested $151,000 in damages. Appellee counterclaimed, seeking $50,000 for an unpaid balance, lost revenue, and items not previously billed. During twelve days of hearings, both sides presented substantive evidence regarding their written issues submitted to the arbitrator. Appellee also apparently offered documentation of its attorneys\u2019 fees.<footnotemark>3</footnotemark> Both sides were then granted leave to file post-hearing briefs.</p>\n<p id=\"b152-4\"><page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"122\">*122</page-number>On 12 August 1993, the arbitrator awarded appellee $2791 and denied appellants\u2019 claims in their entirety. Specifically, the award stated: 1) all subcontractor warranties would be honored; 2) the parties would split administrative fees and. expenses of the AAA as well as the compensation and expenses of the arbitrator; and 3) the award was in full settlement of all claims and counterclaims submitted by the parties. There was no mention of attorneys\u2019 fees.</p>\n<p id=\"b152-5\">On 3 September 1993, appellants filed with the arbitrator a motion to clarify his award as to three issues: 1) what was included in \u201cadministrative fees and expenses;\u201d<footnotemark>4</footnotemark> 2) which defective workmanship was to be covered by \u201cwarranties;\u201d and 3) whether appellee was required to submit \u201cas-built\u201d plans as provided for in the AIA Contract. Appellee filed a response to the motion to clarify, generally opposing appellants\u2019 motion, but also requesting that the award be clarified to order appellants to pay costs and expenses plus appellee\u2019s attorneys\u2019 fees. Citing Md.Code Ann., Cts. &amp; Jud.Proc. \u00a7 3-221,<footnotemark>5</footnotemark> appellee renewed its argument that because the clause in the Home Improvement Contract awarded costs and attorneys\u2019 fees if appellee enforced payment via legal action or other collection action, the arbitrator should have included costs and attorneys\u2019 fees in his award. On 5 October 1993, the arbitrator filed a clarified award generally reaffirming his award of 12 August 1993. Again, however, the award was silent as to attorneys\u2019 fees.</p>\n<p id=\"b153-4\"><page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"123\">*123</page-number>On 17 September 1993, while the motions to clarify were pending, appellants filed in the Circuit Court for St. Mary\u2019s County a motion to vacate the arbitrator\u2019s award, arguing that the award was \u201ccompletely irrational when viewed against the twelve days of hearings and thousands of pages of documentation presented by the parties and the substantive contract provisions.\u201d On 20 October 1993, appellee filed an opposition to the motion to vacate and a petition to correct or modify the award. Appellee\u2019s motion to correct or modify the award argued, pursuant to Md.Code Ann., Cts. &amp; Jud.Proc. \u00a7 3-223(b)(2) (1989 Replacement Volume &amp; 1993 Supp.) and <em>Bernard v. Kuhn, </em>65 Md.App. 557, 501 A.2d 480 (1985),<footnotemark>6</footnotemark> that the circuit court must modify the arbitrator\u2019s award to include appellee\u2019s costs and attorneys\u2019 fees. Appellants filed an opposition to appellee\u2019s petition to correct or modify and a reply to appellee\u2019s opposition to the petition to vacate the award. Appellants argued that none of the statutory bases set forth in \u00a7 3-223(b)(2) was met in this case, and that <em>Bernard </em>was distinguishable because in that case the issue of attorneys\u2019 fees was not submitted to the arbitrator for consideration. Therefore, argued appellants, because the issue of costs and attorneys\u2019 fees was submitted to the arbitrator, \u00a7 3\u2014223(b)(2) and <em>Bernard </em>were inapplicable to the case <em>sub judice.</em></p>\n<p id=\"b153-5\">On 15 November 1993, the circuit court held a hearing on the various motions. At the close of oral argument, the court denied appellants\u2019 motion to vacate and granted appellee\u2019s motion to modify. The court found that \u00a7 3-223(b)(2) empowered it to modify the award in accordance with the Home Improvement Contract language, because the arbitrator ruled on an issue not submitted for arbitration, namely costs and attorneys\u2019 fees. Because this issue was never formally sub<page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"124\">*124</page-number>mitted to the arbitrator, the court ruled that the award must be modified to include attorneys\u2019 fees as per the agreement between the parties. The court then conducted an evidentiary hearing on the amount of attorneys\u2019 fees incurred by appellee and the costs of arbitration, and awarded appellee $53,676.48 plus costs. Appellants filed a timely appeal to this Court.</p>\n<p id=\"b154-4\">\n<em>Discussion</em>\n</p>\n<p id=\"b154-5\">The Maryland Uniform Arbitration Act (Act), Md.Code Ann., Cts. &amp; Jud.Proc. \u00a7\u00a7 3-201 to 3-234 (1989 Replacement Volume &amp; 1993 Supp.), was enacted in 1965 as an alternative method of dispute resolution. The Act embodies a legislative policy favoring enforcement of executory agreements to arbitrate. <em>Gold Coast Mall, Inc. v. Larmar Corp., </em>298 Md. 96, 103, 468 A.2d 91 (1983). The arbitration process, in turn, provides a speedy, informal, relatively inexpensive, and private procedure for resolving controversies arising out of commercial transactions. <em>Bel Pre Medical Ctr., Inc. v. Frederick Contractors, Inc., </em>21 Md.App. 307, 315, 320 A.2d 558 (1974) , <em>rev\u2019d on other grounds, </em>274 Md. 307, 334 A.2d 526 (1975) . Indeed, the General Assembly has established a policy in favor of the settlement of disputes through arbitration, and thus has severely limited the role of the courts in this process. <em>O-S Corp. v. Samuel A. Kroll, Inc., </em>29 Md.App. 406, 409, 348 A.2d 870 (1975).</p>\n<p id=\"b154-8\">The Act does provide, however, that once a court obtains jurisdiction over an arbitration, it retains jurisdiction to correct or modify the award or to vacate the award. <em>C.W. Jackson &amp; Assocs. v. Brooks, </em>289 Md. 658, 426 A.2d 378 (1981). Modification of an arbitrator\u2019s award is governed by \u00a7 3-223(b). If the petition to correct or modify is granted, then \u00a7 3-223(c) requires the court to modify or correct the award to effect its intent and to confirm the award as modified or corrected. Otherwise, the court must confirm the award as made.</p>\n<p id=\"b154-9\">Appellants contend that the circuit court did not have the authority to award attorneys\u2019 fees because the arbitration <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"125\">*125</page-number>agreement did not provide for such fees. Appellants also assert that the circuit court improperly modified the arbitrator\u2019s award to include attorneys\u2019 fees and costs pursuant to \u00a7 3\u2014223(b)(2). Each argument will be considered in turn.</p>\n<p id=\"b155-4\">I.</p>\n<p id=\"b155-5\">Litigants in the United States must follow the so-called \u201cAmerican rule\u201d with regard to attorneys\u2019 fees. A court cannot award attorneys\u2019 fees to the prevailing party unless a statute or contract provision provided for the award, or the losing party brought suit in bad faith. <em>Rice v. Biltmore Apartment Co., </em>141 Md. 507, 517, 119 A. 364 (1922); <em>Maxima Corp. v. Cystic Fibrosis Found,., </em>81 Md.App. 602, 622, 568 A.2d 1170, <em>cert. denied, </em>319 Md. 582, 573 A.2d 1337 (1990). An arbitration award, however, may lawfully include an award of attorneys\u2019 fees if the underlying agreement between the parties so provides. <em>See </em>Md.Code Ann., Cts. &amp; Jud.Proc. \u00a7 3-221(b) (1989 Replacement Volume &amp; 1993 Supp.).</p>\n<p id=\"b155-6\">In arbitration matters, \u00a7 3-221(b) of the Maryland Uniform Arbitration Act governs the award of counsel fees. It provides:</p>\n<blockquote id=\"b155-7\">(b) <em>Counsel </em>fees.\u2014Unless the arbitration agreement provides otherwise, the award may not include counsel fees.</blockquote>\n<p id=\"b155-8\">Therefore, we must first decide what constitutes the \u201carbitration agreement,\u201d and then decide whether that agreement provided for attorneys\u2019 fees.</p>\n<p id=\"b155-9\">Focusing on the language, \u201c[u]nless the arbitration agreement provides otherwise,\u201d appellants contend that the \u201carbitration agreement\u201d in the case <em>sub judice </em>did not otherwise provide for the allocation of attorneys\u2019 fees, and therefore the court had no authority to award such fees. Appellants assert that the arbitration agreement was composed of only what was set forth in Article 4.5 of the General Conditions. That Article stated:</p>\n<blockquote id=\"b155-10\">Any controversy or claim arising out of or related to the contract, or the breach thereof, shall be settled by arbitra<page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"126\">*126</page-number>tion in accordance with the Construction Industry Arbitration Rules of the American Arbitration Association....</blockquote>\n<p id=\"AX_\">Because there is no provision there making either party responsible for attorneys\u2019 fees, appellants argue that the arbitration agreement did not provide for attorneys\u2019 fees and therefore \u00a7 3-221(b) precludes such fees from being awarded in the instant case.</p>\n<p id=\"b156-4\">Appellants also contend, without supporting authority, that even if the arbitration agreement is read more broadly than Article 4.5, the attorneys\u2019 fees provision of the Home Improvement Contract cannot be considered part of the arbitration agreement as it does not apply to arbitration. That provision provides:</p>\n<blockquote id=\"b156-5\">In the event that payment under this contract is enforced through legal action, or other collection action, homeowner agrees to pay contractor\u2019s costs and attorney\u2019s fees related to said action.</blockquote>\n<p id=\"b156-6\">Appellants contend that an arbitration proceeding is not a \u201clegal action, or other collection action\u201d for which they would be responsible for costs and attorneys\u2019 fees.</p>\n<p id=\"b156-7\">Appellee, on the other hand, argues that there was no singular arbitration agreement, but rather numerous clauses throughout the totality of the contract that worked together to establish the arbitration rights of the respective parties. Moreover, appellee contends that because an arbitration is both a legal action and a collection action, the attorneys\u2019 fees provision of the Home Improvement Contract is applicable in the instant case and must be read as part of the agreement to arbitrate.</p>\n<p id=\"b156-8\">While the intent of the parties to award attorneys\u2019 fees for any legal or collection action is readily discernible from the clear and unambiguous language of the Home Improvement Contract, we nevertheless think it appropriate to stress that the intention of the parties to an agreement must be garnered from the terms considered as a whole, and not from the clauses considered separately. <em>Delmarva Drilling Co. v. Tuckahoe Shopping Ctr., Inc., </em>268 Md. 417, 423, 302 A.2d 37 <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"127\">*127</page-number>(1973); <em>Kasten Constr. Co. v. Rod Enters., </em>268 Md. 318, 329, 301 A.2d 12 (1973). It would be contrary to modern contract law to read the arbitration agreement to include only the express authority to arbitrate set forth in Article 4.5. Indeed, Article 4.5 of the General Conditions was only one of several clauses throughout the AIA Contract that related to arbitration.<footnotemark>7</footnotemark></p>\n<p id=\"b157-5\">Maryland courts have long held that \u201cin ascertaining the true meaning of a contract ... the contract must be construed in its entirety and, if reasonably possible, effect must be given to each clause so that a court will not find an interpretation which casts out or disregards a meaningful part of the language of the writing.\u201d <em>Sagner v. Glenangus Farms, Inc., </em>234 Md. 156, 167, 198 A.2d 277 (1963); <em>see also Kimmel v. W.T. Grant Co., </em>233 Md. 466, 469, 197 A.2d 122 (1963); <em>Mattingly Lumber Co. v. Equitable Bldg. &amp; Sav. Ass\u2019n, </em>176 Md. 403, 407, 5 A.2d 458 (1939). One paragraph of special provisions in a contract may not be read alone, without reference to the other paragraphs of special provisions elsewhere in the contract. <em>Kelley Constr. Co. v. Washington Suburban Sanitary Comm\u2019n, </em>247 Md. 241, 249, 230 A.2d 672 (1966); <em>Wheaton Triangle Lanes, Inc. v. Rinaldi, </em>236 Md. 525, 530-31, 204 A.2d 537 (1964); <em>Schapiro v. Jefferson, </em>203 Md. 372, 378, 100 A.2d 794 (1953). Thus the various clauses pertaining to arbitration scattered throughout the AIA Contract must be read <em>in pari materia </em>to comprise the \u201carbitration agreement.\u201d</p>\n<p id=\"b157-6\">The Home Improvement Contract expressly provided that appellee is entitled to costs and attorneys\u2019 fees if it must enforce payment by \u201clegal action, or other collection action.\u201d <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"128\">*128</page-number>Article 4.5 of the General Conditions, however, provided for arbitration in lieu of legal action to resolve a dispute arising out of the ALA Contract. Therefore, by virtue of the agreement to arbitrate contained in the contract, appellants could, and did, confine appellee\u2019s only available means of collection to arbitration. The Court of Appeals has held that \u201c[w]here several instruments are made a part of a single transaction they will all be read and construed together as evidencing the intention of the parties in regard to the single transaction.\u201d <em>Rocks v. Brosius, </em>241 Md. 612, 637, 217 A.2d 531 (1965). Thus the language of the Home Improvement Contract, read <em>in pari materia </em>with the dispute resolution provisions contained elsewhere in the ALA Contract, applies to collection actions such as arbitration. Appellee\u2019s aborted effort to collect via a mechanic\u2019s lien petition, coupled with its counterclaim in arbitration, constituted \u201cother collection actions,\u201d as those terms are used in the Home Improvement Contract. Appellee instituted the action to collect an unpaid balance and was required to pursue its claim through arbitration. Appellants\u2019 petition for arbitration changed the forum of the claim, but did not change the nature of the action. Therefore, we hold that the arbitration proceeding constituted a collection action, thereby vesting authority in the arbitrator and the court to award attorneys\u2019 fees.<footnotemark>8</footnotemark></p>\n<p id=\"b158-4\">II.</p>\n<p id=\"b158-5\">Appellants also contend that the circuit court erred in modifying the arbitrator\u2019s award pursuant to \u00a7 3-223(b)(2) to include costs and attorneys\u2019 fees. As that section permits modification of an award only if the arbitrator ruled upon an issue not submitted for arbitration, appellants argue that the issue of costs and attorneys\u2019 fees was, in fact, submitted for <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"129\">*129</page-number>arbitration and ruled upon by the arbitrator. We consider costs and attorneys\u2019 fees separately to facilitate our analysis.</p>\n<p id=\"b159-4\">\n<em>Attorneys\u2019 Fees</em>\n</p>\n<p id=\"b159-5\">In support of the contention that the issue of attorneys\u2019 fees was submitted for arbitration, appellants highlight several instances in the Joint Record Extract where appellee requested attorneys\u2019 fees. These include, <em>inter alia, </em>appellee\u2019s post-hearing brief directed to the arbitrator, appellee\u2019s response to appellants\u2019 motion to clarify before the arbitrator, and appellee\u2019s petition before the circuit court to correct or modify the award.</p>\n<p id=\"b159-6\">Appellee, on the other hand, argues that the issue of attorneys\u2019 fees was never submitted to the arbitrator. Appellee emphasizes that neither appellants\u2019 written submission of claims for arbitration, nor appellee\u2019s written list of counterclaims, both submitted prior to the commencement of hearings before the arbitrator, contained a request for attorneys\u2019 fees, and the arbitrator\u2019s failure to award attorneys\u2019 fees was, in effect, a ruling on an issue not submitted for arbitration. Therefore, \u00a7 3-223(b)(2) empowered the circuit court, in the exercise of its equitable powers, to modify the award to comply with the express language of the Home Improvement Contract.</p>\n<p id=\"b159-7\">The issues submitted to the arbitrator for determination are clearly enunciated in appellants\u2019 arbitration claim and appellee\u2019s counterclaim. Appellants\u2019 original claim was for defective workmanship and excessive charges. Appellee\u2019s counterclaim was for an unpaid balance, lost revenue, and items not previously billed. There was no claim by either party for attorneys\u2019 fees, and neither party questioned the applicability of the attorneys\u2019 fees provision contained in the Home Improvement Contract. The arbitration agreement plainly provided that all claims for arbitration must be submitted in writing. Article 4.3.1 of the General Conditions required that \u201c[c]laims must be made by written notice.\u201d Paragraph six of the Construction Industry Arbitration Rules (Rules) provided <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"130\">*130</page-number>that the initiating party shall provide written notice setting forth the nature of the dispute to the other party. Paragraph eight explained that, once a claim is filed, any new or different claims or counterclaims shall also be made in writing.<footnotemark>9</footnotemark> While it is apparent from appellee\u2019s post-hearing brief submitted to the arbitrator that it presented evidence during the arbitration proceedings regarding the <em>amount </em>of its attorneys\u2019 fees, the issue of <em>liability </em>for attorneys\u2019 fees was never raised. There is no evidence in the record indicating that either party submitted the issue of liability for attorneys\u2019 fees to the arbitrator.</p>\n<p id=\"b160-4\">Having decided that the issue of liability for attorneys\u2019 fees was not submitted to the arbitrator, we now consider the circuit court\u2019s application of \u00a7 3-223(b). That section provides:</p>\n<blockquote id=\"b160-5\">(b) <em>Conditions for modification or correction of </em>award.\u2014 The court shall modify or correct the award if:</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b160-6\">(1) There was an evident miscalculation of figures or an evident mistake in the description of any person, thing, or property referred to in the award;</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b160-7\">(2) The arbitrators have awarded upon a matter not submitted to them and. the award may be corrected without <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"131\">*131</page-number>affecting the merits of the decision upon the issues submitted; or</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b161-4\">(3) The award is imperfect in a matter of form, not affecting the merits of the controversy.</blockquote>\n<p id=\"b161-5\">The trial judge concluded that subsections (1) and (3) were inapplicable to the case at bar, but that subsection (2) vested the court with authority to modify the award to comply with the attorneys\u2019 fees provision of the Home Improvement Contract. The trial judge explained:</p>\n<blockquote id=\"b161-6\">So, the Court believes the language, \u201cIn the event the payment under this contract is enforced through legal action, or other collection action, homeowner agrees to pay contractor\u2019s costs and attorney\u2019s fees related to said action\u201d that is not something that has been submitted to the Arbitrator for decision.</blockquote>\n<p id=\"b161-7\">It is not apparent from the record, however, whether the judge also found that the arbitrator actually ruled on the issue of attorneys\u2019 fees. Section 3\u2014223(b)(2) permits a court to modify an award only if the arbitrator <em>ruled on </em>an issue not submitted. It is clear that the arbitrator made no reference to attorneys\u2019 fees in either the initial award or the clarified award. Both appellants and appellee, in their briefs as well as at oral argument, agree that such silence constituted a ruling on the issue of attorneys\u2019 fees. We perceive, however, that the arbitrator\u2019s silence as to attorneys\u2019 fees could be construed as either a failure to rule on the issue or a denial of attorneys\u2019 fees to appellee. In either case, we affirm the circuit court\u2019s decision.</p>\n<p id=\"b161-8\">\u201cArbitration\u201d is defined as \u201cthe voluntary submission of a dispute to a disinterested person or persons for final determination.\u201d <em>McKinney Drilling Co. v. Mach I Ltd. Partnership, </em>32 Md.App. 205, 205-06, 359 A.2d 100 (1976) (footnote omitted). The universe of arbitration is therefore defined by those issues that are in dispute. <em>Crown Oil &amp; Wax Co. v. Glen Constr. Co., </em>320 Md. 546, 578 A.2d 1184 (1990); <em>Rosecroft Trotting &amp; Pacing Ass\u2019n v. Electronic Race Patrol, Inc., </em>69 <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"132\">*132</page-number>Md.App. 405, 518 A.2d 137 (1986). An issue not in dispute is not arbitrable.</p>\n<p id=\"b162-4\">The issue of attorneys\u2019 fees in the instant case was not disputed, and therefore not arbitrable. <em>See Bernard, v. Kuhn, </em>65 Md.App. 557, 565-66, 501 A.2d 480 (1986) (quoting <em>Agnew v. Lacey Co-Ply, </em>33 Wash.App. 283, 654 P.2d 712, 715, <em>review denied, </em>99 Wash.2d 1006 (1983)) (\u201c \u2018The question of whether or not attorney\u2019s fees should be awarded to the prevailing party was not an issue submitted to the tribunal for arbitration with the other claims and disputes; having already been decided by the parties by agreement, it was not arbitrable.\u2019 \u201d). The Home Improvement Contract clearly provided that appellee was entitled to costs and attorneys\u2019 fees if it had to enforce payment by legal action or other collection action. The arbitrator, however, ordered the parties to split the costs and remained silent as to attorneys\u2019 fees, in direct contravention of the Home Improvement Contract language. We conclude from the record before us that the arbitrator erroneously deemed this provision inapplicable to an arbitration proceeding and thus awarded costs, but no attorneys\u2019 fees, in accordance with \u00a7 3-221 of the Maryland Uniform Arbitration Act. Consequently, the arbitrator\u2019s failure to award attorneys\u2019 fees was, in effect, a ruling that the \u201cAmerican rule\u201d prevailed, i.e., both sides bear their own attorneys\u2019 fees.</p>\n<p id=\"b162-5\">Assuming that the arbitrator did rule on the issue of attorneys\u2019 fees, we conclude that the circuit court was correct in modifying the award pursuant to \u00a7 3-223(b)(2). In <em>Bernard v. Kuhn, </em>65 Md.App. 557, 501 A.2d 480 (1986), cited by appellee and apparently relied upon by the circuit court, this Court held that a court shall modify an arbitration award to conform to the unambiguous requirements of an arbitration agreement.<footnotemark>10</footnotemark> In <em>Bernard, </em>appellant and appellee entered into a Shareholder\u2019s Agreement whereby appellee agreed to sell <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"133\">*133</page-number>and appellant agreed to purchase 1600 shares of stock in a corporation, B-K Dynamics. Appellee also was granted a right of first refusal if certain specified events occurred. Ultimately, a dispute arose between the parties as to whether a third-party offer to buy company stock triggered appellee\u2019s right of first refusal. Appellee made a demand for arbitration in accordance with the arbitration agreement in the Shareholder\u2019s Agreement. That arbitration agreement provided:</p>\n<blockquote id=\"b163-4\">The cost of said arbitration, including all reasonable attorney\u2019s fees and other proper expenses incident thereto incurred by the winning party, will be borne by the losing party relative to said arbitration, and this fact will be reflected in the arbitrator\u2019s decision.</blockquote>\n<p id=\"b163-5\">The demand for arbitration did not mention the allocation of costs and fees as an issue to be decided.</p>\n<p id=\"b163-6\">Prior to the commencement of the arbitration hearing, the parties stipulated that the arbitrator shall include in the award an allocation of the arbitrator\u2019s expenses in accordance with the arbitration agreement. After a hearing, the arbitrator found for appellant and ordered the parties to share the costs of his fee including the other fees and expenses incurred. Each party was further ordered to pay his own legal fees.</p>\n<p id=\"b163-7\">Appellant filed a motion to modify the award pursuant to \u00a7 3-223(b)(2) alleging that the costs and fees were not a matter submitted for arbitration, and that the division of costs and fees was contrary to the arbitration agreement. The circuit court denied his motion and found that the issue of costs and counsel fees was submitted for arbitration. Reversing the trial court, this Court held that the issue of costs and counsel fees was not submitted for arbitration. <em>Id. </em>at 563, 501 A.2d 480. This Court explained that the issue submitted for arbitration related only to whether a third-party offer to purchase stock triggered appellee\u2019s right of first refusal. <em>Id. </em>Moreover, this Court concluded that \u201c[a]ll that the arbitrator is directed to do with reference to costs is to compute the amount and assess the costs against the non-prevailing party. <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"134\">*134</page-number>The function of the arbitrator in these circumstances is purely ministerial.\u201d <em>Id. </em>at 562, 501 A.2d 480.</p>\n<p id=\"b164-4\">In support of its conclusion in <em>Bernard, </em>this Court cited <em>In re Shapiro, </em>197 Misc. 241, 97 N.Y.S.2d 644 (N.Y.App.Div.1949), <em>modified sub nom. Shapiro v. Gordon, </em>277 A.D. 927, 98 N.Y.S.2d 451 (N.Y.App.Div.1950); <em>Messina &amp; Briante, Inc. v. Blitman Constr. Co., </em>32 Misc.2d 21, 223 N.Y.S.2d 533 (N.Y.App.Div.1961), <em>aff'd, </em>19 A.D.2d 862, 245 N.Y.S.2d 985 (N.Y.1963); and <em>Agnew v. Lacey Co-Ply, </em>33 Wash.App. 283, 654 P.2d 712, <em>review denied, </em>99 Wash.2d 1006 (1983) for the proposition that \u201can arbitrator\u2019s failure to conform an award to the unambiguous requirements of an arbitration agreement is a proper basis for modification of the award.\u201d <em>Id. </em>at 564, 501 A.2d 480. Most apposite to the case at bar is the language of <em>Agnew, </em>quoted by <em>Bernard, </em>65 Md.App. at 565-66, 501 A.2d 480. The Court of Appeals of Washington explained:</p>\n<blockquote id=\"ANm\">The attorney\u2019s fees clause stated that if either party undertook arbitration \u201cthen the prevailing party shall be entitled to reasonable attorney\u2019s fees.\u201d We do not believe that this language, agreed to by both parties <em>prior </em>to arbitration, gave the arbitrators discretion with regard to attorney\u2019s fees except for the amount of the award____ The question of whether or not attorney\u2019s fees should be awarded to the prevailing party was not an issue submitted to the tribunal for arbitration with the other claims and disputes; having already' been decided by the parties by agreement, it was not arbitrable. To hold otherwise would require us to ignore the express language of a contract, something that courts may not do.</blockquote>\n<p id=\"b164-7\">In <em>Bernard </em>and <em>Agnew, </em>the arbitrator ruled upon an issue not submitted for arbitration, thereby empowering the court to modify the award to conform to the contract provision allocating attorneys\u2019 fees and costs. We think the reasoning of these cases is directly applicable to the case <em>sub judice. </em>As we explained in <em>Bernard: </em>\u201cTo hold otherwise would undermine this highly favored method of resolving disputes if contracting parties perceived that contractual provisions mu<page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"135\">*135</page-number>tually agreed upon could be ignored by the arbitration tribunal.\u201d <em>Bernard, </em>65 Md.App. at 566, 501 A.2d 480.</p>\n<p id=\"b165-4\">This conclusion, however, does not end our inquiry. It is equally plausible that the arbitrator\u2019s silence as to attorneys\u2019 fees could be interpreted as a declination to rule on that issue. It is possible that the arbitrator, finding the Home Improvement Contract language inapplicable to the arbitration proceeding, could have decided that he had no authority to award attorneys\u2019 fees pursuant to \u00a7 3-221(b),<footnotemark>11</footnotemark> and therefore declined to rule on that issue. In that event, \u00a7 3-223(b)(2) would be inapplicable, and the circuit court would have been in error in modifying the award pursuant to that section. Yet by extending the reasoning of <em>Bernard </em>and <em>Agnew, </em>we hold that the circuit court, in this instance, would be right for the wrong reasons. When the parties to an arbitration agreement expressly provide for the allocation of costs and counsel fees, and that issue is not in dispute, i.e., not arbitrable, that agreement must be upheld in an arbitration proceeding, and reflected in the award. As explained in <em>Bernard, </em>\u201c[t]he function of the arbitrator in these circumstances is purely ministerial.\u201d <em>Bernard, </em>65 Md.App. at 562, 501 A.2d 480. Should an arbitrator fail to conform the award to the unambiguous requirements set forth in the arbitration agreement, a court shall modify the award to conform to the contract requirements.</p>\n<p id=\"b165-5\">\n<em>Costs</em>\n</p>\n<p id=\"b165-6\">The issue of costs was similarly not submitted for arbitration. It is clear from the face of the award, however, that the arbitrator did rule on this issue. The clarified award stated:</p>\n<blockquote id=\"b165-7\">The administrative fees and expenses of the American Arbitration Association as well as the compensation and expenses of the Arbitrator shall be borne equally by the <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"136\">*136</page-number>parties. Said fees, compensation and expenses shall be paid as directed by the Association.</blockquote>\n<p id=\"b166-5\">Therefore, \u00a7 3-223(b)(2) is applicable, as the arbitrator ruled upon an issue not submitted for arbitration. Consequently, the trial court was not clearly erroneous in modifying the award to order that costs be paid by appellants. Section 3-221(a) provides that \u201c[u]nless the arbitration agreement provides otherwise, the award shall provide for payment of the arbitrators\u2019 expenses, fees, and any other expense incurred in the conduct of the arbitration.\u201d The Home Improvement Contract, as subsumed in the arbitration agreement, expressly provided that the prevailing party in a collection action was to be awarded costs and expenses. Thus the court was correct in invoking its equitable powers to modify the award pursuant to \u00a7 3-223(b)(2).</p>\n<p id=\"b166-6\">JUDGEMENT AFFIRMED; COSTS TO BE PAID BY APPELLANTS.</p>\n<footnote label=\"1\">\n<p id=\"b149-13\">. The circuit court also denied appellants' motion to vacate the arbitrator\u2019s award. Appellants, however, have limited their appeal only \u201cto the issue of whether the court below had authority to modify the arbitration decision and award attorneys\u2019 fees to Loffler.\u201d</p>\n</footnote>\n<footnote label=\"2\">\n<p id=\"b151-7\">. Although Article 4.3.2 provided that all claims \"shall be referred initially to the Architect for action,\u201d that Article also provided that \"[t]he decision by the Architect in response to a Claim shall not be a condition precedent to arbitration ... in the event ... the Claim relates to a mechanic\u2019s lien.\u201d Therefore, appellants initial filing for arbitration, as opposed to filing with the Architect, was arguably proper. In any event, no waiver claim was made below.</p>\n</footnote>\n<footnote label=\"3\">\n<p id=\"b151-8\">. Although no transcripts of the twelve days of hearings are part of the record before the circuit court or us, we are able to conclude that appellee presented evidence to the arbitrator of its attorneys' fees by <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"122\">*122</page-number>virtue, of references appearing in its post-hearing brief alluding to such evidence having been presented to the arbitrator.</p>\n</footnote>\n<footnote label=\"4\">\n<p id=\"b152-7\">. Appellants contended that the cost of the court reporter should be paid by both parties.</p>\n</footnote>\n<footnote label=\"5\">\n<p id=\"b152-8\">. Section 3-221 provides:</p>\n<blockquote id=\"b152-9\">(a) Arbitrators.\u2014Unless the arbitration agreement provides otherwise, the award shall provide for payment of the arbitrators\u2019 expenses, fees, and any other expenses incurred in the conduct of the arbitration.</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b152-10\">(b) <em>Counsel </em>fees.\u2014Unless the arbitration agreement provides otherwise, the award may not include counsel fees.</blockquote>\n</footnote>\n<footnote label=\"6\">\n<p id=\"b153-6\">. Section 3-223(b)(2) provides that \"[t]he court shall modify or correct the award if ... [t]he arbitrators have awarded upon a matter not submitted to them and the award may be corrected without affecting the merits of the decision upon the issues submitted.\u201d <em>Bernard </em>held that pursuant to \u00a7 3-223(b)(2), \"an arbitrator\u2019s failure to conform an award to the unambiguous requirements of an arbitration agreement is a proper basis for modification of the award.\u201d <em>Bernard, </em>65 Md.App. at 564, 501 A.2d 480.</p>\n</footnote>\n<footnote label=\"7\">\n<p id=\"b157-7\">. Article 4 contained several provisions regarding when and how arbitration was to be conducted. Other documents incorporated by reference into the AIA Contract also contained arbitration provisos. For example, the Addendum to Restoration of and Alteration to the Residence of H. Brandis and Joanne K. Marsh, Knight Road, Leonardtown, Maryland (Addendum) contained a clause awarding costs of arbitration to the homeowner if the contractor requested arbitration. That Addendum also gave either party the authority to proceed to arbitration in the event one party was unsatisfied with the Architect\u2019s final decision.</p>\n</footnote>\n<footnote label=\"8\">\n<p id=\"b158-6\">. Appellee cites <em>B &amp; H Constr. &amp; Supply Co. v. District Bd. of Trustees, </em>542 So.2d 382 (Fla.Dist.Ct.App.), <em>review denied, </em>549 So.2d 1013 (Fla. 1989) for the proposition that arbitration is a legal action. Because we hold that arbitration is a collection action under the Home Improvement Contract, however, we need not reach that issue.</p>\n</footnote>\n<footnote label=\"9\">\n<p id=\"b160-8\">. Article 4.5.2 of the General Conditions provided that the Rules \"currently in effect\u201d would govern any arbitrable claims, unless the \"parties mutually agreed otherwise.\u201d The language \"currently in effect\u201d would normally be construed to mean in effect at the time the contract was executed in October 1989. The parties\u2019 arbitration claims, however, were not filed until July-August 1992. The hearings before the arbitrator commenced in December 1992 and concluded in July 1993. In the circuit court, appellee represented that the Rules applied by the arbitrator were those for arbitration cases filed \"on or after May 1, 1992.\u201d Appellants did not contravene that assertion. To the extent that this situation raises the potential for confusion as to which version of the Rules should have been applied by the arbitrator, our research reveals that the apparent discrepancy is not meaningful.</p>\n<p id=\"b160-9\">Only paragraphs six and eight of the Rules appearing in the Joint Record Extract (applying to cases filed on or after May 1, 1992) are of particular relevance to our discussion.
