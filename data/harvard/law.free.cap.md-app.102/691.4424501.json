Appellant poses the following questions:</p>\n<blockquote id=\"b723-13\">I. Whether the self-imposed or self-created hardship discussed in the Maryland case law on variances <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"694\">*694</page-number>requires an intentional act, such as ignoring or flaunting [sic] the zoning regulations.</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"A3_\">II. Does the record before the Honorable Lawrence Daniels support a finding that had the accessory building been built in accordance with the height regulations of Baltimore County, the accessory building would necessarily require a different pitch from all other buildings on the property?</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"AnQ\">III. Can a difference in roof\u2019pitches between an accessory budding and a home constitute a \u201cpractical difficulty or unreasonable hardship\u201d within the meaning of \u00a7 307 of the Baltimore County Zoning Regulations?</blockquote>\n<p id=\"b724-6\">While those questions are limited, appellant expands in his arguments supporting the questions and argues that</p>\n<blockquote id=\"Aqd\">[t]he restrictions of the applicable ordinance, <em>taken in conjunction with the unique circumstances affecting the property, </em>must be the proximate cause of the hardship [Emphasis added.]</blockquote>\n<p id=\"AHz\">and</p>\n<blockquote id=\"b724-7\">Section 307.1 requires that variances only be granted in cases where special circumstances or conditions exist <em>that are peculiar to the land or structure </em>which is the subject of the variance request____ [Emphasis added.]</blockquote>\n<p id=\"b724-9\">and</p>\n<blockquote id=\"b724-10\">Mr. Ward\u2019s property <em>is not unique </em>from the others in the Ruxton area. [Emphasis added.]</blockquote>\n<p id=\"b724-11\">Although somewhat indirectly, appellant has pointed out an important aspect of the nature of the <em>variance </em>process, <em>i.e., </em>it is at least a two-step process. The first step requires a finding that the property whereon structures are to be placed (or uses conducted) is\u2014in and of itself\u2014unique and unusual in a manner different from the nature of surrounding properties such that the uniqueness and peculiarity of the subject property causes the zoning provision to impact disproportionately upon that property. Unless there is a finding that the property is unique, unusual, or different, the process stops here and <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"695\">*695</page-number>the variance is denied without any consideration of practical difficulty or unreasonable hardship. If that first step results in a supportable finding of uniqueness or unusualness, then a second step is taken in the process, <em>ie., </em>a determination of whether practical difficulty and/or<footnotemark>1</footnotemark> unreasonable hardship, resulting from the disproportionate impact of the ordinance <em>caused by </em>the property\u2019s uniqueness, exists. Further consideration must then be given to the general purposes of the zoning ordinance.</p>\n<p id=\"b725-5\">What we have recently observed in Baltimore County, and in other jurisdictions as well, and what occurred in the case at bar, is a reversal of the required process. Instead of first determining whether the subject property is unusual or unique, the zoning authorities are first determining whether a practical difficulty or unreasonable hardship exists. That determination is then used to create a unique and unusual situation as to the subject property because surrounding properties do not experience the hardship or difficulty.</p>\n<p id=\"b725-6\">In the case <em>sub judice, </em>appellee\u2019s act of constructing a building of such a height as to produce a roof pitched at the angle he desired caused the roof to extend above the fifteen-foot height limit. This fact alone was found by the Board (and affirmed by the trial court) to make the property\u2019s problems unique. Simply stated, the variance that is desired (and the difficulties that would exist if it is not granted) cannot be the source of the first prong of the variance process\u2014an inherent uniqueness of the subject property not shared by surrounding properties.</p>\n<p id=\"b726-4\"><page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"696\">*696</page-number>The Facts</p>\n<p id=\"b726-5\">Appellee\u2019s contractor, Donald S. Huber and Company, Inc. (Huber), prepared plans for a garage, wine cellar, and storage area on appellee\u2019s property. Using these plans, Huber, on appellee\u2019s behalf, applied for a building permit, noting on the application that it was to construct a two story \u201cgarage and wine cellar;\u201d \u201c[second] story to be used as storage, [first] floor for garage and wine testing room. Cellar will be for wine.\u201d The application indicates that some prior height indication was marked over on the application for a permit and a new mark was made indicating the anticipated height of the structure to be fourteen feet. Huber admitted that he had little experience with the zoning requirements for accessory buildings and was unaware of the height limitations. The County\u2019s automated tracking system, in creating its general permit application data on the subject property, noted: \u201cHeight: 14\u2019 \u201d and \u201cStories: 2+ CELL.\u201d</p>\n<p id=\"b726-6\">The plans presented to the County included a \u201cLeft Side Elevation\u201d but no height is shown on the elevation plan. Neither, as far as we have been able to find, does the plan contain a scale from which the \u201cLeft Side elevation\u201d can be determined. The plans also include a \u201cFront Elevation\u201d from which actual proposed heights are also conspicuously, almost suspiciously, absent given that all other dimensions appear to be included on the plans.</p>\n<p id=\"b726-7\">We have, however, extrapolated from a horizontal distance indicated on the lower right-hand corner of the \u201cSecond Floor Plan\u201d that fourteen feet five and one-half inches equals slightly over three and one-half inches on our ruler. It would appear that the front elevation plan indicates five and one-fourth inches on our ruler or approximately twenty-one and one-half feet in height. When measured in similar fashion, the left side elevation indicates a similar height. Thus, if the other measurements are correct, a method existed in which, even absent a scale, rough height elevations might have been discernable, though we are at a loss to understand why the <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"697\">*697</page-number>elevations were not given in feet and why the plans contained no scale.<footnotemark>2</footnotemark></p>\n<p id=\"b727-4\">After receiving a building permit, appellee proceeded to construct the building that violated the fifteen foot height requirement. During the building process, inspections were made of footings, foundations, framing, and electrical service. Final occupancy was then given. Later, the building was discovered to be twenty-one feet in height.<footnotemark>3</footnotemark> Appellee then successfully applied for an after the fact variance. Appellant appealed to the Board of Appeals and it, in a two to one decision, granted the variance that the circuit court ultimately affirmed.</p>\n<p id=\"b727-5\">The Law</p>\n<p id=\"b727-6\">The State Zoning Enabling Act was first passed in 1927 by Chapter 705 of the Acts of 1927. It has since been codified as Article 66B of the Annotated Code of Maryland (1957, 1988 Repl.Vol., 1994 Cum.Supp.). While it was generally believed that local subdivisions did not have to enact zoning regulations (and some did not), if enacted, they normally had to conform to the provisions of Article 66B.</p>\n<p id=\"b727-7\">Baltimore County, however, is a charter county and is exempt from many of the provisions in Md.Code Art. 66B. See Md.Code Art. 66B \u00a7 7.03 which provides \u201cExcept as provided in [sections not pertinent here] ... this article does not apply to the chartered counties of Maryland.\u201d Nevertheless, the language of Art. 66B relating to variances is virtually identical to the provisions of the Baltimore County ordinance.</p>\n<p id=\"b728-4\"><page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"698\">*698</page-number>The Article 66B provision that provides for variance authority in local zoning ordinances is section 1.00(j). As relevant to an area variance, this section defines a variance under Art. 66B as follows:</p>\n<blockquote id=\"b728-5\">[Modification only of density, bulk, or area requirements in the zoning ordinance ... where <em>owing to conditions peculiar to the property, and not the result of any action taken by the applicant, </em>a literal enforcement ... would result in either, as specified by the local governing body in a zoning ordinance, unnecessary hardship or practical difficulty. [Emphasis added.]</blockquote>\n<p id=\"b728-6\">The Baltimore County Zoning Ordinance in section 307, \u201cVariances,\u201d provides, in relevant part, that variances from the ordinances provision, <em>i.e., </em>height, may be granted</p>\n<blockquote id=\"Aod\">only in cases where special circumstances or conditions exist <em>that are peculiar to the land or structure </em>which is the subject of the variance request <em>and </em>where strict compliance ... would result in practical difficulty or unreasonable hardship. [Emphasis added.]</blockquote>\n<p id=\"b728-7\">Accordingly, we shall, in our discussion of cases, refer extensively to cases under the provisions relating to Art. 66B as well as cases under the Baltimore County provisions.</p>\n<p id=\"b728-8\">The Baltimore County ordinance requires \u201cconditions ... peculiar to the land ... and ... practical difficulty.... \u201d Both must exist. But the terms \u201cpractical difficulty\u201d and \u201cunreasonable hardship\u201d are stated in the ordinance disjunctively. Thus, at least as to variances other than use variances,<footnotemark>4</footnotemark> if the property is found to be unique, the practical difficulty standard would then apply. We address practical difficulty at some length hereafter. However, as is clear from the language of the Baltimore County ordinance, the initial factor <em>* </em>that must be established before the practical difficulties, if any, are addressed, is the abnormal impact the ordinance has on a specific piece of property because of the peculiarity and <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"699\">*699</page-number>uniqueness of <em>that </em>piece of property, not the uniqueness or peculiarity of the practical difficulties alleged to exist. It is only when that uniqueness is first established that we then concern ourselves with the practical difficulties (or unnecessary hardships in use variance cases).</p>\n<p id=\"b729-5\">Because we have discerned that some of the confusion in this and other jurisdictions may have arisen because of a tendency to intermingle the concepts of special exceptions/conditional uses<footnotemark>5</footnotemark> (where normally an applicant has an easier burden) and variances, we shall first discuss the cases (local as well as foreign) and treatises in which the terms are distinguished. We shall then discuss our cases and certain of those elsewhere in which the proper (and, on occasion, improper) applications of variance law have been applied. The Baltimore County statute will then be restated and applied to the facts and circumstances of the case <em>sub judice.</em></p>\n<p id=\"b729-6\">Special Exceptions (and Conditional Uses) and Variance\u2014Distinguished</p>\n<p id=\"b729-7\">The treatise writers define the concept as:</p>\n<blockquote id=\"b729-8\">A variance is an authorization for [that] ... which is prohibited by a zoning ordinance....</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b729-9\">... [T]he difference between the two [variances and special exceptions] ... is of practical significance....</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b729-10\">\u201c... [T]he variance and exception are designed to meet two entirely different needs. The variance contemplates a departure from the terms of the ordinance in order to preclude confiscation of property, while the exception <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"700\">*700</page-number>contemplates a permitted use ... [once] the prescribed conditions therefor are met.\u201d</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b730-5\">... [A] variance is \u201cauthority ... to use his property in a manner forbidden ...,\u201d while an exception \u201callows him to put his property to a use which the enactment expressly permits.\u201d</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b730-6\">... [T]he standards for ... exceptions are usually less stringent than in the case of variances. A Maryland court summarized this difference and the reason for it.</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b730-7\">\u201cA special exception ... is one which is controlled and ... permissible in a given zone.

Additionally, it has been a necessary prerequisite almost since the inclusion of variance practice in zoning laws\u2014and, before that, it was a part of Maryland case law. That case law is in accord generally with the case law elsewhere as we shall later discuss.</p>\n<p id=\"b733-10\">Early on, prior to the State specifically empowering local governments to delegate the granting of variances to zoning boards, the Maryland Court of Appeals found that the delegation of power to an administrative board to grant variances from the terms of a zoning \u201ctype\u201d ordinance was improper because</p>\n<blockquote id=\"b733-11\">the board of zoning appeals is in effect given the power to set aside or annul the ordinance ... with no more definite standard or guide than that such action may only be taken when there are \u201cpractical difficulties or unnecessary hardships\u201d ....

Mayor and City Council of Baltimore, </em>164 Md. 146, 151, 164 A. 220, <em>appeal dismissed, </em>290 U.S. 585, 54 S.Ct. 56, 78 L.Ed. 517 (1933) (though it questioned the variance provisions under which the appellant sought a variance to operate a funeral home, it upheld the restriction prohibiting the funeral home in the first instance). In <em>Sugar v. North Baltimore Methodist Protestant Church, </em>164 Md. 487, 165 A. 703 (1933), the Court likewise found the board\u2019s powers to grant special exceptions to permit a confectionery store where otherwise prohibited to be invalid for the same reasons.</p>\n<p id=\"b734-6\">In moving towards an acceptance of variance procedures, the Court noted that the \u201cincreasing need for garages in the cities was one of the main reasons for the rapid spread of zoning in this country.\u201d <em>Heath v. Mayor and City Council of Baltimore, </em>187 Md. 296, 300, 49 A.2d 799 (1946). By the time of its decision <em>in Heath, </em>the Court had accepted the inevitable need for formal variance and special exception provisions, noting that \u201c[c]haos would result if [a building engineer] were allowed to make exceptions or variances in his own discretion.\u201d 187 Md. at 301, 49 A.2d 799. The Court further pointed to the special exception powers of the Board of Zoning Appeals as a legally acceptable alternative. The Court also observed that, in response to its decisions in <em>Jack Lewis </em>and <em>Sugar, </em>the city had amended the Baltimore City ordinance to incorporate additional standards to guide the Board. The Court then correctly defined an exception as \u201ca dispensation permissible where the Board ... finds ... those facts ... specified in the ordinance....\u201d <em>Id. </em>187 Md. at 303, 49 A.2d 799.</p>\n<p id=\"b734-7\">It was then that the court, for the first time that we can discern, combined exceptions and variances when discussing conformity to the rules in' regard to the grant of either. This is the first instance where the two concepts were intermingled with respect to the Baltimore City ordinance. To a certain extent, this intermingling has, from time to time, created some <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"705\">*705</page-number>confusion in the cases arising out of Baltimore City. Because of the proportionately larger number of cases arising out of that jurisdiction, that confusion can be seen in subsequent cases arising from other jurisdictions. This intermingling increased over the years and, during this time, Baltimore City amended its ordinance and eventually became subject to an ordinance that does not distinguish between variances and exceptions except as to the title of their respective sections. In other words, Baltimore City, by the terms of its ordinance, applies the same standards to both variances and special exceptions; this standard is the one used elsewhere for variances. Thus, the Baltimore City special exceptions procedure is one only by title. For all practical purposes, it is also a variance procedure.</p>\n<p id=\"b735-5\">Caution should always be used therefore when a court is concerned with special exceptions, as reliance on the cases from Baltimore City may well lead one to rely on inapposite zoning concepts and cases. Judge Marbury, for the Court of Appeals, noticed this unusual circumstance in <em>Dampman v. Mayor and City Council of Baltimore, </em>231 Md. 280, 285, 189 A.2d 631 (1963) (\u201cIn Baltimore City there appears to be no distinction between the two terms.... \u201d).<footnotemark>7</footnotemark> We also attempted to indicate the problem in <em>North v. St. Mary\u2019s County, </em>99 Md.App. 502, 510, 638 A.2d 1175 (1994), in footnote 3:</p>\n<blockquote id=\"b735-6\">Baltimore City\u2019s zoning code makes no distinction between special exceptions and variances. Its code treats special exceptions as if they were variances.... [I]t is generally inexact to rely on Baltimore City cases when a special exception is at issue in another jurisdiction, but would be appropriate when a variance is at issue.</blockquote>\n<p id=\"b735-7\">In any event, as to variances, the Court of Appeals, applying the uniqueness standard, stated:</p>\n<blockquote id=\"b736-4\"><page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"706\">*706</page-number>[I]t was incumbent upon the Marinos to have shown ...

The Court first quoted from 2 Rathkopf, <em>The Law of Zoning and Planning, </em>\u00a7 48-1, and then noted:</p>\n<blockquote id=\"b736-9\">\u201cWhere property, due to unique circumstances applicable to it, cannot reasonably be adopted to use in conformity with the restrictions ... hardship arises....

It was established that a number of attractive trees along the western boundary would have to be destroyed absent a variance. The Court noted that \u201cthere was considerable evidence to show the natural beauty of these trees and their importance to the ecology.\u201d 270 Md. at 211, 310 A.2d 783. The Court, seeming to acknowledge that it was making a detour from Maryland variance law, opined:</p>\n<blockquote id=\"b738-5\">Given the unique facts of this case, we think those criteria are met by this evidence: That the construction of the buildings in strict compliance with the sideyard requirements would result in the destruction of the trees; that the preservation of trees in the construction of the first section had contributed to full occupancy ... that the benefits of retaining the trees would accrue to the general public; that greater density would result from strict compliance____</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b738-6\">Concededly, this is a close case, but it is nevertheless sufficient....</blockquote>\n<p id=\"b738-7\"><em>Id. </em>at 215, 310 A.2d 783. We would have to agree that it is a close case. The opinion does not make mention that the practical difficulty resulted from the fact that the uniqueness of the property caused the ordinance to have a different impact on it than on adjoining property. Also, there was no evidence that the neighboring properties were in any way different than the subject property. If the presence of trees on a particular lot was unique, that might have been a basis, but the court did not make that connection. Thus, this case, coupled with <em>Loyola Federal Savings &amp; Loan Assoc. v. Buschman, </em>227 Md. 243, 176 A.2d 355 (1961), and <em>Frankel v. Mayor &amp; City Council of Baltimore, </em>223 Md. 97, 162 A.2d 447 (1960), is among the affirmances of variances that we perceive to be, at best, extremely close calls and, as we shall indicate, exceedingly rare.</p>\n<p id=\"b739-4\"><page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"709\">*709</page-number>The Court in the sludge storage case of <em>AD + Soil, Inc. v.

The variances were necessary to satisfy the requirements for a conditional use permit to operate the sludge storage and distribution operation. The Court of Appeals noted that the trial court, in affirming the agency\u2019s denial of a variance, agreed that \u201cthe only hardships facing Ad + Soil were of its own making.\u201d 307 Md. at 317, 513 A.2d 893. After addressing the important preemption issues therein raised, the Court directed its attention to the area variances sought and, referring to the Board\u2019s findings, stated that, in Queen Anne\u2019s County, the Board\u2019s authority to grant variances was limited to a situation where \u201cthere are exceptional or extraordinary circumstances or special conditions applying to the property in question ... that do not apply generally to other properties ... in the ... district.\u201d <em>Id. </em>at 340, 513 A.2d 893.

We noted that, in regards to area variances, we were only concerned that the conditions peculiar to the land in question presented practical difficulties. In concluding that the Board had not acted wrongly in denying the variance at issue (a sign variance), we noted: \u201cZoning matters, including sign variance requests, depend upon the unique facts and circumstances <em>of a particular location </em>and must be analyzed individually.\u201d <em>Id. </em>at 227-28, 624 A.2d 1281 (emphasis added).</p>\n<p id=\"b740-8\">In <em>North v.

The cases are <em>McLean, supra; Stacy, supra; Sapero, supra; Loyola Federal Savings &amp; Loan Assoc., supra, </em>(a Baltimore County case); and <em>Frankel, supra. </em>All of these cases were decided over a twelve-year period and the last of them was decided more than twenty-one years ago. Three of them, <em>Frankel, Loyola, </em>and <em>McLean </em>appear to be somewhat at odds with accepted Maryland law. <em>McLean </em>was described by the Court as a \u201c[cjoncededly ... close case.... \u201d <em>Frankel </em>has caused some confusion in that it has later been viewed by some as lowering the standards for the granting of variances. <em>Mayor and City Council of Baltimore v. Borinsky, </em>239 Md. 611, 212 A.2d 508 (1965), involved one of the same issues that was presented in <em>Frankel, i.e., </em>whether a zoning restriction so compromised the use of property as to constitute an unconstitutional taking absent the granting of a variance\u2014a variance Frankel was granted. The Court noted that the trial court had found <em>Frankel </em>controlling. The Court of Appeals disagreed. The Court acknowledged <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"712\">*712</page-number>that Borinsky had the \u201csame expert witness,\u201d \u201che was asked the same general questions ... and gave the same answers,\u201d and that the \u201ceconomic suicide\u201d present in <em>Frankel </em>was \u201cdoubly true in this instance.\u201d <em>Id. </em>239 Md. at 624, 212 A.2d 508. The Court, nevertheless, made a factual distinction and declined to apply <em>Frankel. </em>Judge Barnes opined in dissent that, based on what the Court had done in <em>Frankel, </em>the facts for variances were stronger in <em>Borinsky. Sapero </em>and <em>Stacy </em>met traditional standards for the granting of variances. <em>Frankel, Loyola, </em>and <em>McLean </em>were anomalous cases.</p>\n<p id=\"b742-5\">In any event, nowhere in those five cases, or any others, has the Court of Appeals ever changed the Maryland rule relating to uniqueness and peculiarity of the subject property.</p>\n<p id=\"b742-6\">Cases from other jurisdictions are generally in accord.</p>\n<p id=\"Ao9\">The Supreme Court of Nebraska in <em>Bowman v. City of York, </em>240 Neb. 201, 482 N.W.2d 537 (1992), reversed the grant of a variance for a structure after, pursuant to the variance, the structure was constructed.

The zoning board, approving the variance, determined that she had applied for the permit in good faith. The Skagit County ordinance, as does the instant statute, provided that a variance had to be \u201cbecause of special circumstances applicable to subject property, including size, shape, topography, location or surroundings.... \u201d 715 P.2d at 167. The code also required that an application for a variance include a narration that \u201cspecial conditions and circumstances exist ... peculiar to the land.... \u201d <em>Id. </em>The court then noted that the applicant had done there what Ward attempts to do in the case <em>sub judice:</em></p>\n<blockquote id=\"AsL\">[The appellant] relied primarily upon the fact that the County issued a building permit ... and that she acted in good faith____</blockquote>\n<p id=\"b743-7\"><em>Id. </em>at 168.

In the case <em>sub judice, </em>the <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"714\">*714</page-number>Baltimore County fifteen foot height limitation for accessory buildings does not affect Ward\u2019s property alone; it applies to all of the properties in the neighborhood.</p>\n<p id=\"b744-5\">In <em>Walkingstick v. Board of Adjustment, </em>706 P.2d 899 (Okla.1985), the zoning board, having failed to comply with notice requirements, granted a permit for an oil drilling well. Amoco had expended considerable sums before the board\u2019s omission was discovered. The relevant part of the ordinance involved was similar to the one in the instant case. After the court noted that the hardships alleged were not peculiar to the subject site, it stated the general rule that \u201ca hardship created by the owner ... constitutes no valid basis for a variance.... [Deprivation of an advantage does not constitute an unnecessary hardship.\u201d 706 P.2d at 904. It concluded:</p>\n<blockquote id=\"b744-6\">The need to expose tools to the ravages of the environment may be peculiar to Amoco. But, the language of section 44-107(2) [as does the language in the Baltimore County ordinance] clearly refers to conditions peculiar to the property, <em>not to activities peculiar to the owner of such property.</em></blockquote>\n<p id=\"Axi\"><em>Id. </em>at 904-05 (emphasis added).</p>\n<p id=\"b744-7\">In a decision somewhat difficult to understand, which carried the variance limitations to the extreme and predated the 1992 case of <em>Lucas v. South Carolina Coastal Council, </em>\u2014 U.S. -, 112 S.Ct. 2886, 120 L.Ed.2d 798 (1992), but had facts similar to <em>Lucas, </em>the Supreme Court of Delaware in <em>Baker v. Connell, </em>488 A.2d 1303 (Del.Supr.1985), upheld a trial court\u2019s reversal of the grant of a variance even though the ordinance limited the use of applicant\u2019s entire lot to open space only. The zoning board had found that the property was unique because the entire property was zoned open space and <em>nothing </em>could be constructed there. The board permitted a variance to allow two semi-detached dwellings. The trial court reversed on the grounds that the 0-1 zoning did not make the property unique. The trial court noted that a need for a variance arises only when the plight of the property is unique in that it cannot reasonably be put to a conforming use. The trial court found that there was no evidence that the <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"715\">*715</page-number>property could not conform to open space land. The appellate court affirmed, stating:</p>\n<blockquote id=\"b745-4\">[F]inancial return ... alone, never justifies a variance. As to the unique character of the land, the mere fact that it sits entirely within the 0-1 zone does not make it unique. There is no evidence that this lot is the only one of its type in Rehoboth. Nor does it become unique because it adjoins the R-2 zone containing multi-family units.</blockquote>\n<p id=\"b745-5\">488 A.2d at 1309.

Board of Adjustment, </em>685 P.2d 1032 (Utah 1984), involved a factual scenario similar to the case <em>sub judice. </em>The Xanthoses received notice that they were in violation of the city zoning code. The building of a duplex by the Xanthoses caused a pre-existing dwelling to lose frontage on a public street and to violate set-back and parking requirements. The Xanthoses requested variances in reference to the violations. The court initially noted that, \u201cin order to justify a variance ... the applicant [must] show ... that there are special conditions with regard to the property....\u201d 685 P.2d at 1035-36. The court continued:</p>\n<blockquote id=\"b745-8\">What must be shown ... is that the property itself contains some special circumstance that relates to the hardship complained of....</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b745-9\">... The property is neither unusual topographically or by shape, nor is there anything extraordinary about the piece of property itself. Simply having an old building on land upon which a new building has been constructed does not constitute special circumstances.</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b745-10\">Hardship is not demonstrated by economic loss alone. It must be tied to the special circumstances, none of which have been proven here. Every person requesting a variance can indicate some economic loss. To allow a variance anytime any economic loss is alleged would make a mockery of the zoning program. Further, the Xanthos[es] brought <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"716\">*716</page-number>their losses upon themselves. The application affirmatively alleged ... that no dwelling existed.....<footnotemark>[8]</footnotemark></blockquote>\n<p id=\"b746-6\"><em>Id. </em>at 1036-37 (footnotes omitted).</p>\n<p id=\"b746-7\">The Xanthoses also argued, in a fashion similar to the argument in the case <em>sub judice, </em>that the city should be estopped because the plot plan submitted to the city showed the dwelling and the fact that the city failed to realize it misled them to their detriment. The court noted, in rejecting the Xanthoses\u2019 argument: \u201c[T]o hold that the city should have been put on notice ... in the face of an affirmative statement that no such dwelling existed, would put a premium on prevarication ... and ... shift the burden of proof in variance cases to the city. None of these results is acceptable.\u201d <em>Id. </em>at 1038. In the case at bar, appellants\u2019 application for the permit contained a clear statement that he would comply with the zoning requirements. His plan\u2019s elevation schematics contained neither elevation dimensions nor scale. While the zoning inspectors might have been able to extrapolate dimensions from other schematics, they certainly were not required to do so in light of appellants\u2019 affirmative statement of compliance.</p>\n<p id=\"b746-8\"><em>See also Chambers v. Smithfield City, </em>714 P.2d 1133, 1135 (Utah 1986), where the court stated: \u201c[TJhere is no evidence of special conditions attached to the property itself which do not also attach to other property in the vicinity. The property is neither unusual topographically or by shape, nor is there anything extraordinary about the piece of property itself.\u201d (Footnote omitted.)

The court noted that the conversion was underway when the Bonds discovered a need and applied for a variance. It opined that, <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"717\">*717</page-number>in order to grant a variance, the hardship allegedly created by the ordinance must \u201cnot [be] shared generally by other properties in the same zoning district and the same vicinity.\u201d 300 S.E.2d at 783.

Before applying the facts of the instant case to the law and, thus, resolving the case <em>sub judice, </em>we must touch upon two other aspects of the process, <em>i.e., </em>the self-inflicted injury and the zoning authorities\u2019 acquiescence in issuing a building permit based on plans that left unclear the elevation of the structure and the subsequent inspection.</p>\n<p id=\"b751-8\">Self-Inflicted Hardship</p>\n<p id=\"b751-9\">We have before referred to <em>Marino v. Mayor and City Council of Baltimore, </em>215 Md. 206, 137 A.2d 198. There, the Court said, \u201cit was incumbent [on the applicant] to [show] ... that the hardship was not the result of the applicants\u2019 own actions.\u201d <em>Id. </em>at 218, 137 A.2d 198. The Court of Appeals <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"722\">*722</page-number>noted in <em>AD + Soil, Inc. v.

MacGill, </em>196 Md. 77, 75 A.2d 91 (1950), a property owner sought equitable injunctive relief. The facts <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"723\">*723</page-number>were that while the enactment of a zoning ordinance was pending, the property owner obtained a building permit to construct that which would not be permitted after the enactment of the ordinance. After the ordinance was enacted, the owner constructed, pursuant to the permit, a building that had become prohibited by reason of the passage of the ordinance. The Court noted:</p>\n<blockquote id=\"b753-5\">\u201cAdoption of zoning ordinance <em>ipso facto </em>revokes permit for construction ... where no construction has begun.\u201d</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"AvP\">... They completely ignored the Zoning Regulations, and they were engaged in an unlawful act.</blockquote>\n<p id=\"b753-6\">196 Md. at 85, 75 A.2d 91 (citation omitted). The Court affirmed the revocation of the building permit.</p>\n<p id=\"b753-7\">The Court noted, pursuant to a timely appeal, in <em>Mayor and City Council of Baltimore v. Shapiro, </em>187 Md. 623, 634, 51 A.2d 273 (1947), <em>overruled on other grounds in Nutter v.

Parr, </em>164 Md. 222, 164 A. 743 (1933), a case seeking injunctive relief by way of a restraining order, a city officer mistakenly issued a building permit for an ice factory when the statute prohibited ice factories. The Court there held:</p>\n<blockquote id=\"b754-6\">A municipality may be estopped by the act of its officers if done within the scope and in the course of their authority or employment, but estoppel does not arise should the act be in violation of law---- [T]he ordinance forbade the officials ... to grant the permit which the plaintiff asked and obtained....</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"A3z4\">... [I]t was therefore unlawful for the officers ... to grant the permit, and it would be unlawful for the licensee to do what the purporting permit apparently sanctioned.

Assateague House Condominium Assoc., </em>313 Md. 413, 545 A.2d 1296 (1988), a case seeking specific performance and injunctive relief, and also cited <em>City of Hagerstown v.

In <em>Inlet Associates, </em>the Court opined that \u201cConsequently, \u2018[e]veryone dealing with officers and agents of a municipality is charged with knowledge of the nature of their duties and the extent of their powers, and therefore such a person cannot be considered to have been deceived or misled by their acts when done without legal authority.\u2019 \u201d 313 Md. at 437, 545 A.2d 1296. The Court added: \u201c[T]he doctrine of equitable estoppel \u2018cannot be ... invoked to defeat the ... enforcement of ... ordinances, because of an error or mistake committed by one of its officers ... which has been relied on by the third party to his detriment.\u2019 \u201d <em>Id.</em></p>\n<p id=\"b755-5\">Accordingly, it appears clear that the mistake of a county official cannot be the \u201cpractical difficulty\u201d unique to the subject property required in order to authorize the grant of the variance sought and obtained by Ward.</p>\n<p id=\"b755-6\">The authorities elsewhere are in accord.</p>\n<blockquote id=\"b755-7\">The master also erred in finding that unnecessary hardship resulted from the plaintiffs\u2019 reliance upon representations by the selectmen. This finding disregards the principal that hardship relates to the special character of the <em>land, </em>not to the circumstances of the <em>owner.</em></blockquote>\n<p id=\"b755-8\"><em>Richardson, </em>455 A.2d at 1062.</p>\n<blockquote id=\"b755-9\">[Rjelator argues the Board should be estopped from denying the height variance because a city building inspector visited the premises several times and observed the construction taking place but made no complaint----</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b755-10\">In any case there is no authority on the part of a building inspector to grant a variance----</blockquote>\n<p id=\"b755-11\"><em>Katz v.

In essence, the impact would be the same. The first step of the variance process was thus not met. Had there been evidence before the Board indicating that the subject property was peculiar or unusual and, thus, disproportionately affected by, the height restriction, then we might have been able to conclude that the Board was correct. There was, however, no such evidence presented. Therefore, the Board\u2019s granting of the variance was arbitrary and illegal.</p>\n<p id=\"b756-6\">It is not the purpose of variance procedures to effect a legalization of a property owner\u2019s intentional or unintentional violations of zoning requirements. When administrative entities such as zoning authorities take it upon themselves to ignore the provisions of the statutes enacted by the legislative branch of government, they substitute their policies for those of the policymakers. That is improper.. We shall reverse.</p>\n<p id=\"b756-7\">JUDGMENT REVERSED; COSTS TO BE PAID BY APPETJ.EE.</p>\n<footnote label=\"1\">\n<p id=\"b725-7\">. Some ordinances use the conjunctive, \"and,\u201d creating a requirement that both practical difficulty \"and\u201d unreasonable hardship exist. Because hardship is the most severe standard, this means that it is the standard used regardless of whether an area or use variance is sought. Some ordinances use the disjunctive, \"or,\u201d to separate the two standards. These jurisdictions construe the ordinance to require the unreasonable hardship standard to be used when \"use\u201d variances are sought, because use variances are believed to be more disruptive of zoning goals and purposes, but require the lesser \"practical difficulty\u201d standard when \"area\u201d variances are sought.</p>\n</footnote>\n<footnote label=\"2\">\n<p id=\"b727-8\">.

Because both concepts envision that they are permitted so long as certain conditions are met, the indiscriminate use of the two terms has created little difficulty. In a pure sense, however, \"conditional uses\u201d refer to uses while exceptions normally apply to area, <em>i.e., </em>yard, height, and density matters.
