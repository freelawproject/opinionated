In <em>In re Chmura, </em>461 Mich 517; 608 NW2d 31 (2000) <em>(Chmura I), </em>we held that Canon 7(B)(1)(d) was facially unconstitutional. We thereupon narrowed the language of Canon 7(B)(1)(d), holding that a judicial candidate \u201cshould not knowingly, or with reckless disregard, use or participate in the use of any form of public communication that is false.\u201d We further held that, in determining whether a judicial candidate' engaged in a public communication with reckless disregard of its truth or falsity, the communication must be analyzed to determine if the communication was supported by reasonable facts. Finally, we remanded the present matter to the JTC to determine whether respondent\u2019s conduct violated Canon 7(B)(1)(d), as narrowed. The jtc subsequently determined that respondent\u2019s communications violated the amended version of Canon 7(B)(1)(d). Upon review, however, we respectfully <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"61\">*61</page-number>disagree with the jtc and conclude that such communications were not false. Accordingly, we reject the JTC\u2019s recommendation to suspend respondent from the performance of his judicial duties without pay for ninety days. MCR 9.225.</p>\n<p id=\"b247-4\">I. PROCEDURAL HISTORY</p>\n<p id=\"b247-5\">This judicial disciplinary matter concerns certain advertising disseminated by respondent\u2019s campaign committee during his 1996 election contest for 37th District Court Judge in Warren and Center Line. In this contest, respondent ran against, and defeated, 37th District Court Administrator/Magistrate James R Conrad.</p>\n<p id=\"b247-6\">In April 1998, the jtc filed a complaint against respondent alleging that four of his campaign communications contained \u201cfalse, fraudulent, deceptive, and misleading\u201d statements in violation of the Code of Judicial Conduct Canon 7(B)(1)(d).<footnotemark>1</footnotemark> At the time the JTC filed its complaint against respondent, Canon 7(B)(1)(d) stated in pertinent part:</p>\n<blockquote id=\"b247-7\">(1) A candidate, including an incumbent judge, for a judicial office:</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b247-8\">* * *</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b247-9\">(d) should not use or participate in the use of any form of public communication that the candidate knows or reasonably should know is false, fraudulent, misleading, deceptive, or which contains a material misrepresentation of fact or law or omits a fact necessary to make the statement considered as a whole not materially misleading, or which is <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"62\">*62</page-number>likely to create an unjustified expectation about results the candidate can achieve.</blockquote>\n<p id=\"b248-4\">A. FINDINGS</p>\n<p id=\"b248-5\">As a result of the jtc\u2019s complaint against respondent, this Court appointed the Honorable John P. Kir-wan to serve as master. Following an evidentiary hearing, Judge Kirwan issued a two-part report. In the first part of the report, Judge Kirwan determined that Canon 7(B)(1)(d) was facially unconstitutional because it was overbroad and vague. He concluded that, although the state has the power to regulate a judicial candidate\u2019s speech, the propriety of a regulation hinges upon whether a compelling state interest exists and whether the regulation is narrowly crafted to avoid the infringement of constitutional rights of free speech. Judge Kirwan determined that the state had a compelling interest in overseeing and regulating judicial elections; however, he also determined that the text of Canon 7(B)(1)(d) was not sufficiently specific to clearly apprise judicial candidates regarding the boundaries of what they could and could not permissibly say. He then reasoned that, in cases involving restrictions upon political speech, the judicial canons should restrict only public communications that are false or made with reckless disregard for their truth or falsity, i.e., that Canon 7(B)(1)(d) should only prohibit public communications made with \u201cactual malice,\u201d citing <em>New York Times Co v Sullivan, </em>376 US 254; 84 S Ct 710; 11 L Ed 2d 686 (1964).</p>\n<p id=\"b248-6\">The second part of Judge Kirwan\u2019s report assumed the constitutionality of Canon 7(B)(1)(d). In so assuming, he explained that allegedly deceptive or mis<page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"63\">*63</page-number>leading public communications must be evaluated in the context of whether a voter of average intelligence would have been misled by the communication. Judge Kirwan further asserted that statements must be \u201cclearly\u201d untrue and that obvious statements of opinion did not violate Canon 7(B)(1)(d). After an examination of the communications in question, he concluded that they did not violate Canon 7(B)(1)(d) because an \u201caverage intelligent voter would not have been misled by the messages conveyed to the electorate.\u201d</p>\n<p id=\"b249-4\">Respondent and the jtc examiner both filed written objections to Judge Kirwan\u2019s report with the jtc. The JTC then conducted a hearing and thereafter determined that respondent\u2019s campaign communications, viewed individually and as a whole, revealed a \u201cconscious effort to use false, fraudulent, misleading, and deceptive statements as part and parcel of his campaign strategy.\u201d The JTC therefore recommended that this Court suspend respondent from performance of all judicial duties without pay for a period of ninety days. With regard to Judge Kirwan\u2019s conclusion that Canon 7(B)(1)(d) was overbroad, the jtc disagreed and instead determined that Canon 7(B)(1)(d) was drafted with sufficient precision. In particular, the jtc asserted that Canon 7(B)(1)(d) only applied when a judicial candidate \u201chas knowledge [that] a communication is false, fraudulent, misleading, or deceptive.\u201d</p>\n<p id=\"b249-5\">Moreover, the jtc determined that Canon 7(B)(1)(d) was not constitutionally vague. It asserted that there was no case law holding unconstitutional a judicial canon prohibiting \u201cfalse, fraudulent, deceptive, or misleading\u201d political speech by judges, and that states possess the authority to regulate mislead<page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"64\">*64</page-number>ing statements made in the course of judicial campaigns. The jtc expressed doubt about whether any \u201cactual malice\u201d standard applied to judicial disciplinary matters, but alternatively determined that, in the event such a standard applied, respondent nevertheless acted with \u201cactual malice.\u201d Respondent filed a petition with this Court to reject the jtc\u2019s decision.</p>\n<p id=\"b250-5\">B. CHMURA I</p>\n<p id=\"b250-6\">In <em>Chmura I, </em>we examined whether Canon 7(B)(1)(d) violated the First Amendment of the United States Constitution, applicable to the states through the Fourteenth Amendment. <em>Gitlow v New York, </em>268 US 652, 666; 45 S Ct 625; 69 L Ed 1138 (1925).</p>\n<p id=\"b250-7\">We began our analysis by focusing on whether Canon 7(B)(1)(d) was unconstitutionally overbroad on its face. <em>Chmura I, supra </em>at 530. Upon examination of Canon 7(B)(1)(d), we determined that respondent properly challenged the canon on overbreadth grounds because the canon potentially authorized disciplinary action on the basis of the substantive content of a candidate\u2019s speech. Because Canon 7(B)(1)(d) implicated a First Amendment issue, we accordingly applied an exacting scrutiny analysis to determine if the canon was sufficiently narrowly tailored to serve compelling state interests. <em>Id. </em>at 531-532.</p>\n<p id=\"b250-8\">Although we identified numerous compelling interests in support of the canon, especially the state\u2019s interest in preserving the integrity of the judiciary and its election process, we nevertheless determined that the canon was insufficiently narrowly drawn. <em>Id. </em>at <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"65\">*65</page-number>534-535. Specifically, we noted that Canon 7(B)(1)(d) applied to any statement that the candidate \u201creasonably should know is false, fraudulent, misleading, [or] deceptive,\u201d statements that \u201ccontainf] a material misrepresentation of fact or law,\u201d or that \u201comit a fact necessary to make the statement considered as a whole not materially misleading,\u201d and statements that are \u201clikely to create an unjustified expectation about results the candidate can achieve.\u201d <em>Id. </em>at 536-537. While such prohibitions were equivalent to the types of prohibitions placed on commercial speech, such as attorney advertising, Canon 7(B)(1)(d) does not regulate commercial speech but instead regulates political speech. Political speech is \u201c \u2018at the core of our electoral process and of the First Amendment freedoms\u2019 . . . an area of public policy where protection of robust discussion is at its zenith.\u201d <em>Meyer v Grant, </em>486 US 414, 425; 108 S Ct 1886; 100 L Ed 2d 425 (1988). Because the central purpose of the First Amendment speech clause is to protect core political speech, we determined that political speech may not be regulated in the same manner that commercial speech is regulated.</p>\n<blockquote id=\"b251-4\">[T]o require a parity of constitutional protection for commercial and noncommercial speech alike could invite dilution, simply by a leveling process, of the force of the Amendment\u2019s guarantee with respect to the latter kind of speech. <em>[Chmura I, supra </em>at 538.]</blockquote>\n<p id=\"b251-5\">Therefore, more latitude must necessarily be given for political speech than for commercial speech. We then turned to Canon 7(B)(1)(d) and concluded that it covered \u201call statements, not merely those statements that bear on the impartiality of the judiciary.\u201d <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"66\">*66</page-number><em>Id. </em>at 539. In so doing, the canon reached too far. Our concern was that, under the existing canon, judicial candidates, rather than engaging in robust political give-and-take, might well conclude that the safer course of action was to remain silent on controversial issues lest the canon be inadvertently breached. <em>Id. </em>This concern has been shared by the United States Supreme Court, which has remarked in the context of a discussion of political speech that the state cannot \u201c \u2018select which issues are worth discussing or debating\u2019 ... in the course of a political campaign.\u201d <em>Brown v Hartlage, </em>456 US 45, 60; 102 S Ct 1523; 71 L Ed 2d 732 (1982). The reason is that free political speech is, in effect, a structural protection for democracy. <em>Richmond Newspapers, Inc v Virginia, </em>448 US 555, 587; 100 S Ct 2814; 65 L Ed 2d 973 (1980) (Brennan,. J., concurring). In sum, core political speech cannot be chilled by the subtle deterrent effects of vague and ambiguous limitations.</p>\n<p id=\"b252-5\">Yet, clearly there is something different about judicial campaign speech that all the courts that have dealt with this issue have recognized. There is a tension that exists between the regulation of judges as officers of the court, and the regulation of judges as candidates in the political process.<footnotemark>2</footnotemark> This Court, for example, is obligated to ensure that a judge acts with the \u201chighest standards of personal and professional conduct\u201d so that the administration of justice is not <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"67\">*67</page-number>compromised. <em>In re Bennett, </em>403 Mich 178, 193; 267 NW2d 914 (1978) (citing the Code of Judicial Conduct); Const 1963, art 6, \u00a7 30. At the same time, with regard to a judge who has assumed the role of a political candidate (a role that the people of Michigan by their constitution have made clear that they wish periodically to cast upon members of their judiciary), there are demands of the democratic process that must also be respected. The \u201cFirst Amendment \u2018has its fullest and most urgent application\u2019 to speech uttered during a campaign for political office.\u201d <em>Eu v San Francisco Co Democratic Central Comm, </em>489 US 214, 223; 109 S Ct 1013; 103 L Ed 2d 271 (1989), quoting <em>Monitor Patriot Co v Roy, </em>401 US 265, 272; 91 S Ct 621; 28 L Ed 2d 35 (1971). Thus, we believe that a rule, such as the revised Canon 7(B)(1)(d), prohibiting a judicial candidate from only knowingly or recklessly making a false communication, strikes a reasonable constitutional balance between the candidate\u2019s First Amendment rights and the state\u2019s interest in preserving the integrity of the judicial system.<footnotemark>3</footnotemark> <em>Chmura I, supra </em>at 544. Moreover, First Amendment concerns are substantially different in a system in which the judiciary is selected in a democratic process by the electorate. Allowing elected judges relatively unfettered breathing room ensures that the electorate acts as the primary, although not exclusive, check on judicial integrity and fitness for office.<footnotemark>4</footnotemark></p>\n<p id=\"b254-4\"><page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"68\">*68</page-number>With this in mind, and because the existing Canon 7(B)(1)(d) was not sufficiently narrowly tailored, we revised the canon to state that a judicial candidate \u201cshould not knowingly, or with reckless disregard, use or participate in the use of any form of public communication that is false.\u201d <em>Chmura I, supra </em>at 541. Limiting the reach of the canon, in our judgment, ensured that judicial candidates would have the \u201cnecessary breathing space for freedom of expression\u201d and ensured that the citizenry ultimately would sit as arbiters of undesirable speech that falls short of being false. <em>Id. </em>at 542.</p>\n<p id=\"b254-5\">In <em>Chmura I, </em>we further held that in determining whether a candidate recklessly disregarded the truth or falsity of a public communication, the communication is to be analyzed by an \u201cobjective person\u201d standard. <em>Id. </em>at 542. We opined \u2014 that application of a subjective standard was inappropriate because a subjective test \u201cwould immunize all accusations, however reckless or irresponsible, from censure as long as the attorney uttering them did not actually entertain serious doubts as to their truth . . . .\u201d <em>Chmura </em>/, <em>supra </em>at 543. Under an \u201cobjective person\u201d standard, a judicial candidate may make \u201cstatements that are supported by a reasonable factual basis, even if the candidate turns out to be mistaken.\u201d <em>Id. </em>at 544. We therefore remanded this case to the JTC for a determination of whether respondent engaged in misconduct under Canon 7(B)(1)(d), as modified. <em>Id. </em>at 545.</p>\n<p id=\"b254-6\">C. AFTER REMAND</p>\n<p id=\"b254-7\">After remand, the JTC reaffirmed its previous findings of fact and concluded that respondent\u2019s conduct violated Canon 7(B)(1)(d), as narrowed by this Court <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"69\">*69</page-number>in <em>Chmura I. </em>The JTC began its analysis by asserting that judges are held to the \u201chighest standards of personal and professional conduct.\u201d In accordance with this principle, Canon 7(B)(1)(d) places limits on the boundaries of judicial campaign conduct. '</p>\n<p id=\"b255-4\">As a threshold matter, the JTC stated that respondent, at the time of the campaign, was aware of the obligations imposed by Canon 7(B)(1)(d) and was accountable for the contents of his campaign literature. The JTC then reviewed the four campaign communications in question and determined that, individually and collectively, they revealed a \u201cconscious effort [by respondent] to use false statements and to use them with reckless disregard for their truth or falsity as part and parcel of his campaign strategy.\u201d According to the JTC, respondent\u2019s strategy was to \u201cwage a \u2018brass knuckles\u2019 campaign\u201d to retain judicial office because respondent \u201cregardfed] himself as an outsider faced with a hostile environment at the 37th District Court.\u201d Offended by this, the JTC concluded that respondent\u2019s conduct constituted misconduct in office, with such conduct being clearly prejudicial to the administration of justice. In so concluding, the JTC recommended that this Court suspend respondent from the performance of all judicial duties without pay for ninety days. Respondent again petitioned this Court to reject the jtc\u2019s decision and recommendation.</p>\n<p id=\"b255-5\">n. appellate standards</p>\n<p id=\"A2\">A. STANDARD of review</p>\n<p id=\"b255-6\">We review the jtc\u2019s decision and recommendation de novo. <em>In re Mikesell, </em>396 Mich 517, 520; 243 NW2d <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"70\">*70</page-number>86 (1976), citing <em>In re Somers, </em>384 Mich 320, 323; 182 NW2d 341 (1971). Thus, it is necessary to review the record in the present case in its entirety to determine whether respondent\u2019s public communications violated Canon 7(B)(1)(d).<footnotemark>5</footnotemark></p>\n<p id=\"b256-5\">B. BURDEN AND STANDARD OF PROOF</p>\n<p id=\"b256-6\">The language used in Canon 7(B)(1)(d) has its roots in defamation law. <em>New York Times Co, supra. </em>Thus, we examine defamation case law for guidance in analyzing whether a judicial candidate knowingly, or with reckless disregard, has used or participated in the use of any form of public communication that is false.</p>\n<p id=\"b256-7\">As a preliminary matter, however, it is necessary to identify the applicable burden and standard of proof. At early common law, the defendant bore the burden of proving the truthfulness of an allegedly defamatory statement. <em>Philadelphia Newspapers, Inc v Hepps, </em>475 US 767, 776; 106 S Ct 1558; 89 L Ed 2d 783 (1986). However, this common-law rule came to be viewed as overly restrictive of free speech.</p>\n<blockquote id=\"b256-8\">A rule compelling the critic of official conduct to guarantee the truth of all his factual assertions \u2014 and to do so on pain of libel judgments virtually unlimited in amount \u2014 leads <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"71\">*71</page-number>to a comparable \u201cself-censorship.\u201d Allowance of the defense of truth, with the burden of proving it on the defendant, does not mean that only false speech will be deterred .... Under such a rule, would-be critics of official conduct may be deterred from voicing their criticism, even though it is believed to be true and even though it is in fact true, because of doubt whether it can be proved in court or fear of the expense of having to do so. . . . The rule thus dampens the vigor and limits the variety of public debate. <em>[New York Times, supra </em>at 279.]</blockquote>\n<p id=\"b257-4\">Thus, the common-law rule requiring a defendant to prove the truthfulness of his statements was superseded by the constitutional rule (of the First Amendment) that the plaintiff, in a defamation action, must show the falsity of a statement. <em>Philadelphia Newspapers, Inc, supra </em>at 776; <em>New York Times Co, supra </em>at 279-280. Moreover, the plaintiff was required to show, by clear and convincing evidence, that the defendant acted with \u201cactual malice\u201d when he related the defamatory falsehood. See, e.g., <em>Harte-Hanks Communications, Inc v Connaughton, </em>491 US 657, 686; 109 S Ct 2678; 105 L Ed 2d 562 (1989); <em>Bose Corp v Consumers Union of United States, Inc, </em>466 US 485, 511; 104 S Ct 1949; 80 L Ed 2d 502 (1984). \u201cJudges, as expositors of the Constitution, have a duty to independently decide whether the evidence in the record is sufficient to cross the constitutional threshold that bars the entry of any judgment that is not supported by clear and convincing proof of \u2018actual malice\u2019.\u201d <em>Harte-Hanks Communications, Inc, supra </em>at 686, quoting <em>Bose Corp, supra </em>at 511.</p>\n<p id=\"b257-5\">In light of this, we are persuaded that, in cases involving a violation of Canon 7(B)(1)(d), the jtc, as the moving party, has the burden of proving, by clear and convincing evidence, that the communications in <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"72\">*72</page-number>question are proscribed by the canon. Clear and convincing evidence is evidence that \u201cproduce[s] in the mind of the trier of fact a firm belief or conviction as to the truth of the allegations sought to be established, evidence so clear, direct, and weighty and convincing as to enable [the factfinder] to come to a clear conviction, without hesitancy, of the truth of the precise facte in issue.\u201d <em>In re Martin, </em>450 Mich 204, 227; 538 NW2d 399 (1995), quoting <em>In re Jobes, </em>108 NJ 394, 407-408; 529 A2d 434 (1987).</p>\n<p id=\"b258-5\">m. \u201cFALSE\u201d COMMUNICATIONS</p>\n<p id=\"b258-6\">When analyzing whether a judicial candidate has violated Canon 7(B)(1)(d), it is necessary that the communication be false.<footnotemark>6</footnotemark> <em>Chmura I, supra </em>at 541. However, before a judicial candidate\u2019s public communication is tested for falsity, the communication at issue must involve objectively factual matters. <em>Milkovich v Lorain Journal Co, </em>497 US 1, 18-19; 110 S Ct 2695; 111 L Ed 2d 1 (1990). Speech that can reasonably be interpreted as communicating \u201crhetorical hyperbole,\u201d \u201cparody,\u201d or \u201cvigorous epithet\u201d is constitutionally protected. <em>Id. </em>at 17. Similarly, a statement of opinion is protected as long as the opinion \u201cdoes not contain a provably false factual connotation . . . .\u201d <em>Id. </em>at 20. We are mindful that in protecting hyperbole, parody, epithet, and expressions of opinion, some <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"73\">*73</page-number>judicial candidates may inevitably engage in \u201cvehement, caustic, and sometimes unpleasantly sharp attacks on government and public officials.\u201d <em>New York Times Co, supra </em>at 270. As a result of these attacks, \u201cpolitical speech by its nature will sometimes have unpalatable consequences.\u201d <em>McIntyre v Ohio Elections Comm, </em>514 US 334, 357; 115 S Ct 1511; 131 L Ed 2d 426 (1995). Indeed, as is arguably true in the present case, even potentially misleading or distorting statements may be protected.<footnotemark>7</footnotemark> However, we believe that these rules are necessary in light of our \u201cprofound national commitment to the principle that debate [by judicial candidates] on public issues should be uninhibited, robust, and wide-open . . . .\u201d <em>New York Times Co, supra </em>at 270.<footnotemark>8</footnotemark> Once it has been determined that a communication contains objectively factual matters, those matters must then be tested to determine whether they are true or false.</p>\n<p id=\"b259-4\">The concept of falsity was discussed by the United States Supreme Court in <em>Masson v New Yorker Magazine, Inc, </em>501 US 496; 111 S Ct 2419; 115 L Ed 2d 447 (1991). See also <em>Milkovich, supra. </em>\u201cThe common law of libel takes but one approach to the question of falsity, regardless of the form of the communication <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"74\">*74</page-number>.... It overlooks minor inaccuracies and concentrates upon substantial truth.\u201d <em>Masson, supra </em>at 516, citing Restatement Torts, 2d, \u00a7 563, at 163, comment C (1977); Prosser &amp; Keeton, Torts (5th ed), \u00a7 111, at 776. As long as \u201cthe substance, the gist, the sting\u201d of the communication is true, minor inaccuracies do not amount to falsity. <em>Masson, supra </em>at 517. In other words, the communication \u201cis not considered false unless it would have a different effect on the mind of the reader from that which the pleaded truth would have produced.\u201d <em>Id. </em>This test has been commonly referred to as the \u201csubstantial truth doctrine.\u201d <em>Rouch v Enquirer &amp; News of Battle Creek Michigan (After Remand), </em>440 Mich 238, 260; 487 NW2d 205 (1992). This Court applied this doctrine in <em>Rouch, </em>asserting that the constitutional requirement for testing falsity mirrors Michigan\u2019s common law. <em>Id. </em>As the Court held, \u201cThe common law has never required defendants to prove that a publication is literally and absolutely accurate in every minute detail.\u201d <em>Id. </em>at 258.</p>\n<p id=\"b260-5\">The \u201csubstantial truth doctrine\u201d has in substance, if not in name, been applied to cases in which the defendant gets the details or particulars correct but conveys a <em>potentially </em>false communication. See, e.g., <em>Locricchio v Evening News Ass\u2019n, </em>438 Mich 84, 123-127; 476 NW2d 112 (1991) (discussing defamation by imphcation); <em>Hawkins v Mercy Health Services, Inc, </em>230 Mich App 315; 583 NW2d 725 (1998); see also Prosser, Torts (5th ed), \u00a7 116 at 117 (1988 supp). However, we believe that because a judicial candidate\u2019s communication could be interpreted in \u201cnumerous, nuanced ways, a great deal of uncertainty would arise as to the message conveyed.\u201d See, e.g., <em>Auvil v CBS \u201c60 </em>Minutes,\u201d 67 F3d 816, 822 (CA 9, 1995) (dis<page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"75\">*75</page-number>cussing uncertainty that can arise regarding messages conveyed by broadcast media). This type of uncertainty would often make it difficult for judicial candidates to predict whether their communications would be encompassed within the proscriptions of Canon 7(B)(1)(d). Such uncertainty, as we have discussed earlier in this opinion, \u201craises the spectre of a chilling effect on speech.\u201d <em>Id.</em></p>\n<p id=\"b261-4\">Accordingly, we conclude that in analyzing whether a judicial candidate has violated Canon 7(B)(1)(d), the public communication must be analyzed to determine whether the statements communicated are literally true. If so, the judicial candidate will not be in violation of Canon 7(B)(1)(d). However, if the communication conveys an inaccuracy, the communication as a whole must be analyzed to determine whether \u201cthe substance, the gist, the sting\u201d of the communication is true despite the inaccuracy. In other words, we must decide whether the communication is substantially true. If so, the judicial candidate will not be in violation of the canon. However, if \u201cthe substance, the gist, the sting\u201d of the communication is false, then it can be said that the judicial candidate \u201cused or participated in the use of a false communication.\u201d Once this has been determined, the inquiry then turns to whether a judicial candidate\u2019s communication was made knowingly or with reckless disregard. <em>Chmura I, supra </em>at 544. If it was, the candidate has acted in violation of Canon 7(B)(1)(d).</p>\n<p id=\"b261-5\">IV. APPLICATION</p>\n<p id=\"b261-6\">Although legitimate questions might be raised about the seemliness of some of respondent\u2019s communications, it is ultimately not our task to pass upon <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"76\">*76</page-number>such matters because we have no greater competence in this regard than does the citizenry as a whole. Neither we, nor the jtc, are arbiters of propriety. Rather, that assignment belongs to \u201cWe the People.\u201d This Court\u2019s responsibility is the more narrow one of determining whether respondent\u2019s campaign communications violated Canon 7(B)(1)(d). In doing so, we apply the aforementioned principles of falsity to determine whether respondent\u2019s public communications were clearly shown by the jtc to be knowingly false or used with reckless disregard as to their truth or falsity.</p>\n<p id=\"b262-5\">Because the four campaign communications at issue were sufficiently described by this Court in <em>Chmura I, </em>we quote, in turn, their descriptions before our discussion on each.</p>\n<p id=\"b262-6\">A. EXHIBIT 1</p>\n<blockquote id=\"b262-7\">Exhibit 1 is a two-page flier entitled \u201cRobin Hood?\u201d The cover portrays former Detroit Mayor Coleman Young as a Robin Hood figure. The left page inside the flier contains a photograph of Mayor Young above the following text: \u201cColeman Young wanted your money, but one man stood in the way . . . Judge John Chmura.\u201d The right page contains a photograph of respondent. The text on that page states that \u201cColeman Young and the Lansing crowd cooked up a plan to take your tax dollars and spend them on Detroit\u2019s school districts. They called it Robin Hood \u2014 they stole from our taxpayers, our schools and our children to help prop up Coleman Young.\u201d It describes respondent\u2019s actions as \u201cstanding up to Coleman Young\u201d and \u201cstanding up for your children.\u201d The text characterizes respondent\u2019s role in the lawsuit challenging the statutory scheme as taking \u201cthe state to court, arguing one appeal after another, until the state backed down and allowed your kids to benefit from your hard-earned tax dollars.\u201d Under the subheading \u201cOne <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"77\">*77</page-number>Tough Judge,\u201d the text relates respondent\u2019s involvement in term limits and anti-taxation causes before taking the bench. It further states that, as a judge, respondent has conducted himself in accordance with his prior actions by taking \u201cone criminal after another off our streets.\u201d The flier then repeats that respondent is \u201calways standing up for what\u2019s right.\u201d It also reiterates that respondent is \u201cone tough judge.\u201d The back page of the flier contains a photograph of respondent with his family and lists his professional and civic affiliations. <em>[Chmura I, supra </em>at 520.]</blockquote>\n<p id=\"b263-4\">In its decision, the JTC asserted that respondent inaccurately characterized Detroit Mayor Coleman Young\u2019s role in the property tax base sharing (ptbs) legislation<footnotemark>9</footnotemark> \u2014 legislation that respondent described as \u201cRobin Hood\u201d legislation. In particular, the jtc stated that there was \u201cno credible evidence that Coleman Young, with or without the help of others from Lansing, planned, drafted or even actively supported the measure.\u201d However, in citing this lack of evidence on the respondent\u2019s part, the jtc improperly shifted the burden of proof to respondent on this issue. The burden of proof here does not lie with respondent but with the JTC. They failed to present clear and convincing evidence that proved the <em>falsity </em>of the communication. That is, they did not make any showing that Young did <em>not </em>support the PTBS legislation.<footnotemark>10</footnotemark> See, e.g., <em>Harte-Hanks Communication Inc, supra </em>at 686.</p>\n<p id=\"b264-4\"><page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"78\">*78</page-number>Next, the jtc determined that exhibit 1 falsely communicated that respondent had \u201cprevented Coleman Young and others from taking tax . . . [revenue] from Warren and Center Line property owners to spend on the Detroit school system.\u201d<footnotemark>11</footnotemark> The jtc again referenced the ptbs legislation and explained that, under the provisions of the act, tax revenue from the Warren and Center Line School Districts could not be directly shifted to the Detroit School District.</p>\n<p id=\"b264-5\">Further, on the basis of these two findings \u2014 that Warren and Center Line tax revenue could not, in the jtc\u2019s view, be directly shifted to the city of Detroit, and that there was no proof that Coleman Young was involved with the legislation \u2014 the jtc concluded that the brochure was an effort on the part of respondent to appeal to \u201cracist attitudes among the electorate.\u201d It noted, however, that the use of the allegedly racist advertisement, alone, did not fall within the prohibitions of Canon 7(B)(1)(d), but concluded that because it was \u201ccoupled with the false statements, the ad is convincing and clear evidence of the [respondent's reckless disregard for the truth.\u201d</p>\n<p id=\"b264-6\">Contrary to the jtc, we find that respondent did not \u201cfalsely\u201d communicate that he prevented Coleman Young and others from taking tax dollars from the cities of Warren and Center Line to spend on the Detroit school system. In 1991, the ptbs legislation was enacted by the Michigan Legislature in an effort to <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"79\">*79</page-number>address disparities in school spending that resulted from a variance in the property tax base in Michigan school districts. MCL 380.751 <em>et seq. </em>To accomplish this, subsections 751(l)(h) and (i) classified state school districts into two regions, region 1 and region 2. Within each region, a school district would be classified as an \u201cout-of-formula\u201d or an \u201cin-formula\u201d school district. MCL 380.751(l)(e)(f). The \u201cout-of-formula\u201d school districts were those that generally had higher property tax revenues, while the \u201cin-formula\u201d school districts were those that generally had lower property tax revenues. Because the \u201cout-of-formula\u201d districts typically generated more tax revenues, \u00a7 752 of the legislation required that such school districts share a portion of their tax revenues with the \u201cin-formula\u201d school districts in their own regions. Under the legislation, the Warren and Center Line School Districts were located in region 1 and were determined to be \u201cout-of-formula\u201d school districts. The Detroit School District, on the other hand, was located in region 2 and was an \u201cin-formula\u201d school district. Thus, at first blush, it appears that Warren\u2019s and Center Line\u2019s tax revenues would be shared with \u201cin-formula\u201d school districts within region 1, which did not include the Detroit School District. However, subsection 752(3) further provided that in the event that</p>\n<blockquote id=\"b265-4\">the department determines that the total amount of aid per in-formula district pupil paid under subsection (2)(a) and (b) in a region in a state fiscal year varied by more than 10% from the state average amount paid per in-formula district pupil paid under subsection (2) (a) and (b) in that state fiscal year, the department shall submit a report [to the legislature and the governor] .... Unless the legislature enacts legislation . . . that redefines the boundaries of each region to reduce the variance to 10% or less . . . each <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"80\">*80</page-number>out-of-formula district shall make payments to the chief financial officer . . . and that individual shall make payments to each in-formula district as if the entire state were a single region ....</blockquote>\n<p id=\"b266-5\">On the basis of the above provision, it is clear that the ptbs legislation clearly contemplated that tax revenue potentially could be shifted directly from the Warren and Center Line School Districts to the Detroit School District. The fact that Warren\u2019s and Center Line\u2019s tax revenues would not have <em>initially </em>been transferred directly to the city of Detroit does not make respondent\u2019s communication false, given the overall legislative scheme of the act. Accordingly, respondent\u2019s claim that he \u201cprevented\u201d Coleman Young and others from taking tax revenue from Warren and Center Line property owners is not false.<footnotemark>12</footnotemark></p>\n<p id=\"b266-6\">We further believe that the jtc improperly found, as \u201cracist,\u201d the Robin Hood caricature, which had, as its head, a photograph of Coleman Young. Instead, we conclude that the mayor\u2019s image was used merely as a well-understood <em>symbol </em>for the city of Detroit and its school district. Further, we believe that the use of Coleman Young\u2019s photograph can be seen as an effort to convey a \u201csuburban\u201d versus \u201curban\u201d tension implicated by the ptbs legislation. Even assuming that the <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"81\">*81</page-number>photograph evinced some form of subliminal racial expression \u2014 an assumption that we do not necessarily accept \u2014 such an expression would not fall within the proscription of Canon 7(B)(1)(d).<footnotemark>13</footnotemark> <em>Milkovich, supra </em>at 13.</p>\n<p id=\"b267-4\">Lastly, the jtc contends that respondent\u2019s use of the word \u201cstole\u201d in exi\u00fabit 1 falsely conveyed to the electorate criminal behavior on the part of Coleman Young. Again, we respectfully disagree. The word \u201cstole\u201d in respondent\u2019s communication did not reasonably communicate a statement of fact concerning criminal activity. Instead, it was merely a colloquial reference unquestionably, in our judgment, understood by readers in the context of a political brochure. It was, in the language of <em>Milkovich, supra </em>at 17-20, \u201crhetorical hyperbole.\u201d Viewing the word in context suggests that respondent chose the word to summarize the effect of the ftbs legislation. The task was obviously to convey the view that this legislation would redistribute school funds from one district to <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"82\">*82</page-number>another. This is the language of the rough-and-tumble world of politics. It is core political speech. It is consumed by an often skeptical and wary electorate and it does not, in our judgment, fairly implicate the proscriptions set forth in Canon 7(B)(1)(d).<footnotemark>14</footnotemark></p>\n<p id=\"b268-6\">Because exhibit 1 does not convey a false communication, it is unnecessary to determine whether respondent\u2019s communication was supported by reasonable facts. <em>Chmura I, supra </em>at 544.</p>\n<p id=\"b268-7\">B. EXHIBIT 3</p>\n<blockquote id=\"b268-8\">Exhibit 3 is a one-page circular, folded in half, entitled \u201cIt didn\u2019t have to be this way.\u201d The cover contains a photograph of a partially obscured police officer in a patrol car. The inside of the flier contains a depiction of a mug shot with the caption \u201cMurder . . . Rape . . . Dismemberment . . . Innocent Victims . . . Could Jim Conrad\u2019s Court have stopped it?\u201d The accompanying text states that James Craig Cristini had appeared at least four times in 37th District Court during Conrad\u2019s tenure as court administrator and magistrate and had \u201creceived only a slap on the wrist\u201d each time. It states that Cristini was \u201clet back out for only $100\u201d after being charged with assault and battery. The flier further states that \u201cafter being released on a second Assault and Battery charge, Cristini went on a rampage of murder and mayhem,\u201d resulting in \u201c[i]nnocent victims, raped, murdered and dismembered.\u201d The text concludes with the following: \u201cThat\u2019s what happens when you put bureaucrats in charge of a court. Jim Conrad . . . He\u2019s just a bureaucrat.\u201d <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"83\">*83</page-number>The back of the circular contains the text \u201cEnd the Fear.\u201d <em>[Chmura I, supra </em>at 520-521.]</blockquote>\n<p id=\"b269-5\">With regard to exhibit 3, the JTC determined that respondent\u2019s communication swept too broadly by falsely attaching blame to James Conrad for certain decisions made by 37th District Court judges \u2014 specifically, that Conrad was responsible for releasing criminal defendant James Craig Cristini numerous times after imposing only minor punishments. Although we agree with the JTC that this statement could be interpreted as communicating that Conrad was specifically responsible (when he was not) for the subsequent crimes committed by Cristini, the brochure nevertheless is also subject to a more benign interpretation.<footnotemark>15</footnotemark></p>\n<p id=\"b269-6\">It is often the case that affiliation is described by a possessive construction. In describing an institution as \u201cJohn Doe\u2019s,\u201d one interpretation might be that John Doe is in charge of, and responsible for, that institution; an alternative interpretation might be that John Doe is merely associated in some manner with the institution. The JTC determined that the rhetorical question \u201ccould Jim Conrad\u2019s Court have stopped it?\u201d could only mean that Conrad himself was the individual responsible for the judicial decisions made in the Cristini matter. We agree that such a reference would be false. However, an alternative interpretation is that respondent\u2019s rhetoric was merely to communicate Conrad\u2019s significant association with a court which, in <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"84\">*84</page-number>respondent\u2019s judgment, had conducted itself irresponsibly in its dealings with Cristini. As court administrator, Conrad had significant administrative duties within the court and was an integral part of its day-today operations. Indeed, respondent\u2019s political message was, in essence, a response to what was the primary political thrust of the Conrad candidacy, namely, that Conrad as court administrator and magistrate, had significant administrative and quasi-judicial duties within the 37th District Court that would recommend his promotion to judge.<footnotemark>16</footnotemark> By this understanding, it was not altogether inaccurate to refer to the court as \u201cJim Conrad\u2019s Court.\u201d As it is the case, as earlier discussed, when a statement is found to have a potentially non-false interpretation, the inquiry under Canon 7(B)(1)(d) must end.</p>\n<p id=\"b270-5\">Next, the advertisement stated \u201cJames Craig Cris-tini appeared in the 37th District Court at least 4 times while Jim Conrad was Court Administrator and Magistrate. Each time, he received only a slap on the wrist.\u201d A review of the evidence showed that at the time of the 1996 election, Cristini did appear in the <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"85\">*85</page-number>37th District Court numerous times on various misdemeanor and felony charges including disturbing the public peace, disorderly intoxication, and assault and battery charges. When Cristini\u2019s disturbance of the public peace and disorderly intoxication charges proceeded to trial, the court approved the dismissal of the former charge in exchange for Cristini\u2019s plea of guilty to the latter charge. Cristini was sentenced to seventy-five days in jail and $200 in costs and fines. With regard to Cristini\u2019s assault and battery charge, his bond was set at $100. Additionally, the statement accurately communicated that James Conrad was a court administrator and magistrate when Cristini appeared in the 37th District Court; the statement did not indicate that Cristini personally appeared before Conrad. In light of this history, we find that the communication did not relate a false statement of fact.</p>\n<p id=\"b271-4\">The jtc also found that respondent improperly referenced that Cristini was \u201clet back out for only $100\u201d by Conrad after Cristini was charged with assault and battery. According to the JTC, Conrad did not preside over this case, and Cristini was released pursuant to an interim bond. Unlike the jtc, we find that this communication did not contain a false statement of fact. A review of the 37th District Court Criminal Case Inquiry revealed that on September 5, 1993, Cristini was charged with assault and battery, and a $100 bond was set. The fact that the advertisement failed to set forth the particulars of the bond is of no consequence as long as the statement was literally true. Further, the advertisement does not specifically name Conrad as the person who released Cristini. Thus, we conclude that this communication does not make a false statement of fact. Masson, <em>supra </em>at 496.</p>\n<p id=\"b272-5\"><page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"86\">*86</page-number>Because exhibit 3 does not convey a false communication, it is unnecessary to determine whether respondent\u2019s communication was supported by reasonable facts. <em>Chmura I, supra </em>at 544.</p>\n<p id=\"b272-6\">C. EXHIBIT 4</p>\n<blockquote id=\"b272-7\">Exhibit 4 is a two-page flier entitled \u201cWe shouldn\u2019t have to worry about sexual harassment at work or violence at home!\u201d The cover of the flier contains a photograph of a young woman sitting at a typewriter with a male hand touching her shoulder and a photo of a [bruised] young woman with a young girl. The upper half of the inside of the flier is captioned \u201cMagistrate Jim Conrad is facing trial for sexual harassment of a female court employee!\u201d It includes a photograph of Conrad with a woman identified as a \u201cformer court reporter\u201d leaning on his shoulder. The woman\u2019s face is obscured. Also included is a reduced image of a pleading described as a \u201cSexual Harassment complaint filed against Magistrate Jim Conrad.\u201d The text states \u201cConrad tries to dodge trial by claiming \u2018government immunity.\u2019 \u201d It explains in smaller type that Conrad \u201cis accused of intimidating and firing a female court employee because she complained of being sexually harassed on the job. Papers filed with the court by Conrad\u2019s lawyers say that he can\u2019t be tried because, as Magistrate, he has governmental immunity!\u201d It further states that the complaint had cost Warren and Center Line taxpayers \u201cthousands of tax $$$ to defend! Now, he wants your vote for District Court judge!\u201d</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"Ate\">The bottom half of the inside of the flier is entitled \u201cJudge John Chmura .... One Tough Judge\u201d and contains two photographs of him on the bench, one of which shows him exchanging papers with Macomb County Prosecutor Carl Marlinga. The text states \u201cTough on domestic violence and stalkers!\u201d It explains that respondent is \u201ctough on criminals who prey on women\u201d and \u201cwon\u2019t stand for acts of domestic violence or allow stalkers to run wild.\u201d It further states that respondent \u201cwon\u2019t tolerate sexual harassment of court employees,\u201d explaining that respondent \u201cthinks your <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"87\">*87</page-number>peace of mind comes first!\u201d The bottom half of the flier also includes a favorable quote about respondent from Prosecutor Marlinga. The back of the flier contains a photograph of respondent with his family, a list of professional and civic affiliations, and a list of ten endorsers. The text also describes respondent as \u201cone tough judge.\u201d <em>[Chmura I, supra </em>at 521-522.]</blockquote>\n<p id=\"b273-4\">With regard to exhibit 4, the JTC concluded that respondent falsely communicated that James Conrad was charged with sexual harassment. The JTC noted that at the time the communication was disseminated, the sexual harassment charge was no longer viable because it was dismissed pursuant to a summary disposition hearing. We respectfully disagree. On May 28, 1993, Carrie Meyer, the sexual harassment complainant, filed a complaint against James Conrad and others alleging, among other things, sex discrimination and sexual harassment. And while it is true that the sexual harassment count was eventually dismissed pursuant to summary disposition, other claims remained that included the sexual harassment allegations. One such claim was Meyer\u2019s retaliatory discharge claim. A review of the complaint revealed that this claim incorporated by reference the pertinent paragraphs of the sexual harassment claim, in essence, paragraphs 28-32. Paragraphs 28-32 asserted that Conrad owed a duty not to discriminate against the complainant because of her sex and that, despite this duty, Conrad had engaged in numerous instances of sex discrimination and harassment.</p>\n<p id=\"b273-5\">Next, the JTC determined that respondent falsely conveyed the nature of the sexual harassment engaged in by Conrad. The JTC determined that, when one viewed the totality of the advertisement, includ<page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"88\">*88</page-number>ing the pictures and captions, the advertisement falsely communicated that Conrad was facing potential sexual harassment charges involving unwanted physical contact. We again respectfully disagree. The front page of exhibit 4 stated that the Warren and Center Line electorate \u201cshouldn\u2019t have to worry about sexual harassment at work and violence at home.\u201d This text was accompanied by two photographs. One photograph shows a young woman sitting at a typewriter with a male hand touching her shoulder and the other photograph shows a bruised woman with a young child. We believe that the photographs were us\u00e9d as a visual tool to convey to a layman respondent\u2019s positions against sexual harassment and domestic violence, and could not lead a reasonable person to conclude that the circumstances shown in the sexual harassment photograph were reflective of the circumstances of James Conrad\u2019s particular sexual harassment suit.</p>\n<p id=\"b274-5\">The jtc next found that exhibit 4 falsely communicated that James Conrad was accused of firing Meyer after she complained about the sexual harassment at work. The jtc found that Conrad, as a court administrator and magistrate, possessed no authority to fire court personnel and instead found that Meyer was fired by the 37th District Court judges. Although it is true that Conrad, as a court administrator and magistrate, did not have the authority to hire or fire court employees, Meyer, in her complaint, asserted that Conrad <em>did </em>fire her. In pertinent part, the complainant asserted that defendants, including Conrad, had discriminated against her and that, on the basis of this discrimination, she suffered numerous injuries including loss of employment. Therefore, respondent <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"89\">*89</page-number>did not inaccurately communicate that James Conrad was accused of firing a female court employee.</p>\n<p id=\"b275-4\">Finally, the jtc found that respondent improperly used a photograph of Lisa Burgor, a freelance court reporter, to falsely represent Meyer. Moreover, they concluded that the caption under Burgor\u2019s photograph falsely stated that she was a former court reporter. The photograph at issue showed Conrad with a woman whose face is concealed. Below the photograph, it reads: \u201cMagistrate Jim Conrad with a former court reporter.\u201d This is not false.. Lisa Burgor testified that she was a freelance court reporter at the time the photograph was taken and that she had appeared in the 37th District Court numerous times. Nowhere does respondent claim that the individual in the photo was complainant. Further, we find that the reference to Burgor as a former court reporter is not false. As stated above, Burgor testified that she had appeared in the 37th District Court numerous times as a freelance court reporter. Thus, respondent correctly described the woman as \u201cformer court reporter.\u201d</p>\n<p id=\"b275-5\">Because exhibit 4 does not convey a false communication, it is unnecessary to determine whether respondent\u2019s communication was supported by reasonable facts. <em>Chmura I, supra </em>at 544.</p>\n<p id=\"b275-6\">D. EXHIBIT 5</p>\n<blockquote id=\"b275-7\">Exhibit 5 is a one-page circular, folded in half, that includes a drawing on its cover of a man leaving a courthouse asking the question \u201cWhere is my Courtroom?\u201d The left half of the inside of the flier contains the \u201canswer\u201d: \u201cJim Conrad is not a Judge, he has no courtroom.\u201d</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b276-5\"><page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"90\">*90</page-number>The right half of the inside of the flier is captioned \u201cSo what has Jim Conrad been doing as Court Administrator for the past 7 years?\u201d The text below the question states \u201cMurders and Stalkers . . . , back on the streets . . . commit crimes again . . . It explains: \u201cIn case after case . . . Murderer James Craig Cristini . . . Stalker Edward Lightfoot . . . Hardened, violent criminals appeared in the 37th District Court again and again only to be let out to commit more crimes.\u201d Under the heading \u201cCorruption and Inefficiency,\u201d the flier states that federal investigators were looking into charges that the 37th District Court Probation Department \u201cwas running a scam under which court employees were receiving kickbacks, making big money off people\u2019s misery.\u201d</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b276-6\">Under the heading \u201cSued for Sexual Harassment,\u201d the text states that \u201c[w]hen court employee Carrie Meyer complained about the way she was treated at work, Jim Conrad threatened her job, demoted her, and harassed her.\u201d It further states that \u201cConrad\u2019s actions have resulted in a major sexual harassment lawsuit which has cost Warren and Center Line thousands to defend. But what\u2019s Conrad\u2019s defense? That he shouldn\u2019t be prosecuted because of government immunity.\u201d The text concludes with the statement \u201cThat\u2019s what happens when you put bureaucrats in charge of a court. Jim Conrad . . . He\u2019s just a bureaucrat.\u201d The text on the back of the flier states \u201cNo More Bureaucrats.\u201d <em>[Chmwra I, supra </em>at 522-523.]</blockquote>\n<p id=\"b276-7\">The JTC concluded that exhibit 5 falsely suggested that James Conrad was responsible for felonies committed by criminal defendants James Craig Cristini and Edward Lightfoot after these two individuals had appeared in the 37th District Court on misdemeanor charges, when in fact Conrad had limited involvement with each of these individuals. The communication, in pertinent part, stated that \u201c[i]n case after case . . . Murderer James Craig Cristini . . . Stalker Edward Lightfoot . . . Hardened, violent criminals appeared in the 37th District Court again and again <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"91\">*91</page-number>only to be let out to commit more crimes.\u201d As discussed previously in exhibit 3, the evidence demonstrated that Cristini was charged and convicted of numerous misdemeanors and felonies and was subsequently released after arguably modest penalties were imposed upon him. Court documents then identify that, shortly thereafter, Cristini was charged with open murder. Additionally, court documents indicate that Edward Lightfoot had been charged with making a telephone call with the intent to \u201cterrorize, frighten, intimidate, threaten, harass, molest, annoy, or disturb the peace and quiet\u201d of a complainant in violation of MCL 750.540e(l)(e). Bond was set by James Conrad in the amount of $3,500. At the time Lightfoot\u2019s bond was set for $3,500, he had been previously charged with several misdemeanors in the 37th District Court. In light of this record, we find that respondent\u2019s statement that Cristini and Lightfoot \u201cappeared in the 37th District Court again and again only to be let out to commit more crimes\u201d was not false.</p>\n<p id=\"b277-4\">The JTC also contends that exhibit 5 falsely communicated that numerous 37th District Court probation department employees were being investigated for allegedly illegal activities. Specifically, the jtc determined that the investigation extended to only one employee and not to numerous employees as stated in the advertisement. In pertinent part, the communication states that \u201c[fjederai officers are looking into charges that the 37th District Court Probation department was running a scam under which court employees were receiving kickbacks, making big money off people\u2019s misery.\u201d A review of the record shows that the statement was inaccurate. The record reveals that the investigation of the 37th District Court Probation Department involved a single individual, Orba Under<page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"92\">*92</page-number>wood. However, this inaccuracy does make the substance of the communication false. <em>Masson, supra </em>at 517. The \u201csubstance\u201d or \u201cgist\u201d of the statement was to communicate the fact of the investigation of the 37th District Court probation department, including the allegedly illegal activities that had occurred within the department. The fact that the communication inaccurately stated that the investigation involved multiple employees does not, in our judgment, alter the substance of what respondent communicated. We believe that if the communication had correctly identified that the investigation involved only one individual, the effect on the mind of the reader would be no different \u2014 the \u201cgist\u201d of the communication would still be that the probation department was being investigated for allegedly illegal activities. Thus, the communication is not false for purposes of Canon 7(B)(1)(d).</p>\n<p id=\"b278-5\">Finally, the JTC expressed that the statement concerning the probation investigation falsely held Conrad responsible for the allegedly illegal activities of the probation department. We disagree. Nowhere does the communication cite James Conrad as the person responsible for the allegedly illegal activity. The advertisement merely highlighted that there was an investigation of the department, and set forth the specific allegations, in essence, that illegal \u201ckickbacks\u201d were involved.</p>\n<p id=\"b278-6\">Because exhibit 5 does not convey a false communication, it is unnecessary to determine whether respondent\u2019s communication was supported by reasonable facts. <em>Chmura I, supra </em>at 544.</p>\n<p id=\"b278-7\">V. CONCLUSION</p>\n<p id=\"b278-8\">The Code of Judicial Conduct, Canon 7(B)(1)(d), states that a judicial candidate \u201cshould not knowingly, <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"93\">*93</page-number>or with reckless disregard, use or participate in the use of any form of public communication that is false.\u201d When analyzing whether a judicial candidate has violated the canon, we conclude that the communication at issue must have conveyed an objectively factual matter. Thus, speech that can be reasonably interpreted as communicating hyperbole, epithet, or parody is protected, at least under Canon 7(B)(1)(d). Similarly, an expression of opinion is protected under the canon as long as it does not contain provably false factual connotations. If the communication at issue sets forth objectively factual matters, the communication must then be analyzed to determine whether the statements communicated are literally true. If they are, the judicial candidate will not be in violation of Canon 7(B)(1)(d). However, if the public communication conveys an inaccurate statement, the communication, as a whole, must be analyzed to determine whether \u201cthe substance, the gist, the sting\u201d of the communication is true despite such inaccuracy. Once it has been determined that a judicial candidate has, in fact, made a false public communication, the inquiry then focuses on whether such communication was made knowingly or with reckless disregard.</p>\n<p id=\"b279-4\">Pursuant to the above rules regarding false communications, we conclude that respondent did not violate Canon 7(B)(1)(d). A review of the four exhibits reveal that the communications were either literally true, substantially true despite their inaccuracies, or communicated mere rhetorical hyperbole. Thus, we reject the jtc\u2019s recommendation to suspend respondent from all judicial activities without pay for a period of ninety days.

It is not at all obvious to this Court why the mayor of the largest city in Michigan would <em>not </em>have been involved in encouraging the enactment of legislation resulting in the transfer of substantial amounts of tax revenues into that city in order to bolster school finances. Upon a closer review, it may well be shown that neither the mayor nor his representatives or lobbyists, either directly or indirectly, communicated the views of the city to either the Governor or to members of the Legislature; <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"78\">*78</page-number>however, it would hardly be surprising if such a review demonstrated the contrary. In any event, this is a matter for the jtc to prove, not for the respondent to disprove.</p>\n</footnote>\n<footnote label=\"11\">\n<p id=\"b264-8\"> The jtc acknowledges that respondent, as a private attorney, challenged the constitutionality of the ptbs legislation. The jtc contends that it is respondent\u2019s statements about the means by which the legislation shifted money from one school district to another that was false.</p>\n</footnote>\n<footnote label=\"12\">\n<p id=\"b266-7\"> Because of the specific language of subsection 752(3), it is unnecessary to determine whether respondent\u2019s statements might still fall outside the scope of Canon 7(B)(1)(d) on the ground that the details of the administrative arrangements under the ptbs statute should not obscure the larger truth that tax revenues are flowing out of district A (Warren and Center Line) and into district B (Detroit). Presumably, if this inflow and outflow did not balance in any of the legislatively created \u201cregions,\u201d such regions would be adjusted in order that this occur. By this view, the gravamen of the statute is that it is essentially a \u201czero-sum\u201d game in which benefits derived from one district must necessarily be compensated for by costs incurred by another.</p>\n</footnote>\n<footnote label=\"13\">\n<p id=\"b267-5\"> This, of course, does not mean that expressions of racial bias are to be tolerated among members of the judiciary.

To emphasize this latter record, Conrad highlighted numerous cases where a defendant\u2019s bond had been set by him at $50,000 or higher. For example, one advertisement identified six separate such instances and stated in part \u201c$100,000 cash bond on a person arrested for assault with intention to murder;\u201d \u201c$250,000 cash bond on a person arrested with intention to rob with a firearm;\u201d \u201c$50,000 cash bond on a person arrested for assault with intention to murder;\u201d \u201c$100,000 cash bond on a person arrested for armed robbery;\u201d \u201c$100,000 cash bond on a person arrested for delivery of heroin, assault with deadly weapon and fleeing police;\u201d \u201c$100,000 cash bond on a person arrested for operating under the influence of liquor causing death and incapacitation injury.\u201d On the basis of such advertising, it was not altogether unexpected that respondent would reply with communications that characterized Conrad\u2019s close association with the district court in a less positive light.</p>\n</footnote>\n</opinion>\n<opinion data-order=\"8\" data-type=\"opinion\" id=\"x999-2\" type=\"dissent\">\n<author id=\"b280-6\">Cavanagh, J.</author>\n<p id=\"Aijj\">(dissenting). Though I do not disagree with the majority\u2019s articulation of the standard for falsity under Canon 7(B)(1)(d) and its application of that standard to exhibits 3, 4, and 5, I disagree with the application to exhibit 1 in this case. Because I believe that exhibit 1 conveys a false communication, I would impose some level of discipline on respondent. I, therefore, must respectfully dissent.</p>\n<p id=\"b280-7\">Among other matters, exhibit 1 advertised respondent\u2019s role in challenging property tax base sharing legislation. Respondent stated that the legislation \u201cstole from our taxpayers, our schools and our children to help prop up Coleman Young,\u201d and stated that, in the course of \u201cstanding up for your children,\u201d he took \u201cthe state to court, arguing one appeal after another, until the state backed down and allowed your kids to benefit from your hard-earned tax dollars.\u201d<footnotemark>1</footnotemark> The Judicial Tenure Commission concluded that this exhibit falsely communicated that respondent had \u201cprevented Coleman Young and others from taking tax dollars from Warren and Center Line property owners to spend on the Detroit school system.\u201d In contrast with the majority, I agree.</p>\n<p id=\"b280-8\">As the majority opinion explains, Warren and Center Line were placed in region 1 under the tax legislation, and Detroit was placed in region 2. <em>Ante </em>at 79. Because the legislation provided that school districts would only share revenue with other districts within the same region, tax revenue from Warren and Center Line could not actually have been directed to Detroit. The majority concludes that respondent\u2019s <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"95\">*95</page-number>statement that he prevented Warren and Center Line\u2019s tax revenue from being directed to Detroit is nevertheless not false because the overall legislative scheme provided that if several contingencies had arisen, Warren and Center Line\u2019s tax revenues could have been directed to Detroit. See <em>id. </em>at 79-80; see also MCL 380.752(3), repealed 1993 PA 175.</p>\n<p id=\"b281-4\">That conclusion, however, does not consider what respondent actually communicated. Importantly, in exhibit 1 respondent stated that Coleman Young and his supporters <em>\u201cstole </em>from our taxpayers\u201d to \u201chelp prop up Coleman Young.\u201d Though I take no issue with respondent\u2019s hyperbolic use of the term \u201cstole,\u201d it nonetheless refers to a completed act, not a potential act that depended on a chain of contingencies, as the majority concludes.<footnotemark>2</footnotemark> Here, respondent did not state that the legislation \u201cwould steal,\u201d \u201ccould steal,\u201d or \u201cwas going to steal\u201d Warren and Center Line\u2019s tax revenue. Instead, by stating that the legislation \u201cstole\u201d from Warren and Center Line, respondent communicated that the perceived wrong had already been perpetrated. Further, he communicated that the lawsuit he handled corrected that wrong when \u201cthe state backed down.\u201d Because of the statutory region classifications, though, revenue from Warren and Center Line had not, and could not have, gone to Detroit. By communicating that he brought a lawsuit that prevented Detroit from receiving tax revenue that had <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"96\">*96</page-number>been stolen to benefit Detroit, then, respondent conveyed an \u201cinaccurate statement,\u201d that is, a false communication.</p>\n<p id=\"b282-6\">With that false communication, the analysis must proceed to step two, which considers whether the gist, substance, or sting of the communication is true despite the factual inaccuracy. That is, the analysis must consider whether the inaccuracy \u201calters the complexion of the affair, and would have no different effect on the reader than that which the literal truth would produce . . . .\u201d <em>Rouch v Enquirer &amp; News of Battle Creek (After Remand), </em>440 Mich 238, 259; 487 NW2d 205 (1992), quoting <em>McAllister v Detroit Free Press Co, </em>85 Mich 453, 461; 48 NW2d 612 (1891); see also <em>ante </em>at 73-74.</p>\n<p id=\"b282-7\">For largely the same reasons that the communication was false, the gist, sting, and substance of the communication is also false. Respondent stated that \u201cColeman Young and the Lansing crowd\u201d completed an act-they \u201cstole\u201d from Warren and Center Line-and that respondent handled a lawsuit, the result of which was that they \u201cbacked down and allowed your kids to benefit from your hard-earned tax dollars.\u201d The literal truth, however, is that when respondent was handling the lawsuit he referenced, no revenue had been, and no revenue could be, directed from Warren and Center Line to Detroit. This literal truth would have a different effect on the reader than respondent\u2019s inaccurate statement. The effect of the literal truth was that respondent was counsel on a case challenging legislation that, at most, might have sent revenue from Warren and Center Line to Detroit if certain facts had come to be, but was not sending any revenue from Warren and Center Line to Detroit. On the other hand, the effect of respondent\u2019s inaccurate <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"97\">*97</page-number>statement was that the legislation \u201cstole\u201d from Warren and Center Line, sent the revenue to Detroit to \u201cprop up\u201d its mayor, and that the suit respondent handled was necessary to force the state to back down and allow school children in Warren and Center Line to benefit from those cities\u2019 tax dollars and stop sending those tax dollars to Detroit. Because the pleaded truth would have had a different effect on the mind of the reader than the inaccurate statement, the statement was not substantially true, and therefore violated Canon 7(B)(1)(d).</p>\n<p id=\"b283-4\">This violation of the Canon provides a basis for imposing discipline on respondent. Recently, this Court set forth a nonexhaustive list of factors that should be applied when determining the sanction for judicial misconduct. See <em>In re Brown, </em>461 Mich 1291, 1292-1293 (2000). However, absent a majority favoring disciplining respondent, an analysis of those factors would have no effect in this case, so I will refrain from discussing them. Suffice it to say that I conclude that respondent has violated Canon 7(B)(1)(d). I, therefore, respectfully dissent.</p>\n<judges id=\"b283-5\">Kelly, J., concurred with Cavanagh, J.</judges>\n<footnote label=\"1\">\n<p id=\"b280-9\"> <em>Ante </em>at 76-77, for a full description of exhibit 1.</p>\n</footnote>\n<footnote label=\"2\">\n<p id=\"b281-5\"> As the msgority states, respondent used \u201cstole\u201d to colorfully describe the effect of the legislation. <em>Ante </em>at 81. \u201cColorfully\u201d also euphemistically describes the racial overtones this flier intended to convey. However, had respondent used a less inflammatory phrase, perhaps saying that the legislation \u201cappropriated revenue from\u201d or \u201credistributed money from\u201d Warren and Center Line to Detroit, this point would nevertheless remain true. The focus is not the connotation of the term respondent used to describe the act, but that the term he used described a completed act rather than a pending act.</p>\n</footnote>\n</opinion>\n</casebody>\n",
