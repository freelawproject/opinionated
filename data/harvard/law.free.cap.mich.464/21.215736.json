Plaintiff, Yellow Freight System, Inc., alleges that defendants collected registration fees in excess of the amount allowed under the 1991 Intermodal Surface Transportation Efficiency Act (istea), 49 USC 11506, which restricts a state\u2019s registration fees to an amount \u201cequal to the fee . . . that such state collected or charged as of November 15, 1991,\u201d 49 USC 11506(c) (2) (B) (iv) (III). Specifically, plaintiff contends that in determining the amount of the fee charged or collected on November 15, 1991, one must consider the effect that any then existing reciprocity agreements had on the fees.</p>\n<p id=\"b210-5\">We reject plaintiff\u2019s claims and hold that in determining the \u201cfee . . . collected or charged\u201d under 49 USC 11506(c)(2)(B)(iv)(III), Michigan\u2019s reciprocity agreements are irrelevant. We reverse the Court of Appeals decision affirming the Court of Claims order for. summary disposition in favor of plaintiff and remand this case to the Court of Claims for further proceedings consistent with this opinion.</p>\n<p id=\"b210-6\">i</p>\n<p id=\"b210-7\">Congress has' the power to \u201cregulate Commerce . . . among the several States\u201d and \u201c[t]o make all Laws which shall be necessary and proper for carrying into Execution\u201d that power to regulate commerce. US Const, art I, \u00a7 8. Under the Commerce Clause, states can impose significant regulatory burdens on interstate motor carriers only when authorized to do so by Congress. <em>Michigan Pub Utility Comm, v Duke, </em>266 US 570, 577; 45 S Ct 191; 69 L Ed 445 (1925). Over the years Congress has authorized the states to require registration of interstate motor earners, sub<page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"25\">*25</page-number>ject to the supervision of the Interstate Commerce Commission. See Motor Carrier Act of 1935, PL 74-265, 49 USC 301 <em>et seq. </em>In 1991, Congress passed the istea,<footnotemark>1</footnotemark> which directed the Interstate Commerce Commission (icc) to restructure the then existing regulations governing vehicle registration and registration fees. 49 USC 11506. As a result, the ICC issued the \u201csingle state\u201d registration system (SSRS) in 1993, 49 CFR 1023.<footnotemark>2</footnotemark></p>\n<p id=\"b211-5\">A brief overview of the previous interstate motor carrier registration system is helpful in understanding the dispute now before this Court. Before 1991, states could require interstate motor carriers to annually register and pay fees on each vehicle that operated within its borders. Thirty-nine states, including Michigan, elected to participate in a \u201cbingo card\u201d system.<footnotemark>3</footnotemark> Under the \u201cbingo card\u201d system interstate motor carriers attached a \u201cbingo card\u201d to each of their motor vehicles. States through which the vehicle traveled then issued each vehicle a registration \u201cstamp\u201d which was placed in a designated area on the bingo card. Participating states were allowed to charge no more than $10 per stamp.</p>\n<p id=\"b211-6\">While operating under the prior \u201cbingo card\u201d registration system, some states entered into reciprocity agreements, under which a state would discount or waive the registration fee for carriers based in the <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"26\">*26</page-number>other\u2019s state. The motor carrier\u2019s principal place of business was most commonly used as the basis for determining reciprocity. Michigan, however, initially based its reciprocity agreements on the state in which the vehicle was \u201cbase-plated,\u201d i.e., where it was registered or license-plated.<footnotemark>4</footnotemark></p>\n<p id=\"b212-5\">Seeking to \u201cbenefit the interstate carriers by eliminating unnecessary compliance burdens\u201d and \u201cto preserve revenues for the states which had participated in the bingo program,\u201d Congress replaced the old system by enacting the istea.<footnotemark>5</footnotemark> The ssrs was intended to serve as the sole avenue for state registration of interstate carriers.<footnotemark>6</footnotemark> <em>Nat'l Ass\u2019n of Regulatory Utility Comm\u2019rs v Interstate Commerce Comm, </em>309 US App DC 325; 41 F3d 721 (1994). Under the ssrs a motor carrier registers annually with only one state. This \u201cregistration state\u201d is responsible for collecting the per-vehicle fees and distributing them to any participating states through which the carrier runs its motor vehicles. 49 USC 11506(c)(2)(A)(iii).</p>\n<p id=\"b212-6\">The section of the istea at issue in the present case is subsection 11506(c)(2)(B)(iv). It provides that each state \u201cshall establish a fee system\u201d that \u201cresult[s] in a fee for each participating state that is equal to the fee, not to exceed $10 per vehicle, that such State collected or charged as of November 15, 1991 . . . .\u201d</p>\n<p id=\"b212-7\">In 1991, before the implementation of the ssrs, the Michigan Public Service Commission (mpsc) altered <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"27\">*27</page-number>its reciprocity agreements. The mpsc adopted the more common \u201cplace of business\u201d method of determining reciprocity, instead of the \u201cbase-plated\u201d system that the mpsc had been using. This change was scheduled to become effective in February 1992. The MPSC mailed renewal applications reflecting this change to all interstate motor carriers, including the plaintiff, in September 1991. Plaintiff paid its 1992 fees<footnotemark>7</footnotemark> in September of 1991, under protest. Subsequently, plaintiff instituted this litigation.</p>\n<p id=\"b213-5\">Plaintiff contended that Michigan could not alter its reciprocity agreements, arguing that under the federal statute those agreements were frozen at their November 15, 1991, levels. Ruling on cross motion, the Court of Claims agreed with plaintiff and granted its motion, in part, for summary disposition.<footnotemark>8</footnotemark> In a two-to-one decision, the Court of Appeals affirmed the Court of Claims ruling. 231 Mich App 194; 585 NW2d 762 (1998). This Court granted leave to appeal, 461 Mich 1009 (2000).</p>\n<p id=\"b213-6\">ii</p>\n<p id=\"b213-7\">There is no dispute that 49 USC 11506(c)(2)(B)(iv)(III) froze the registration fees that <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"28\">*28</page-number>a state can charge as of November 15, 1991. The parties dispute the proper interpretation of a key phrase in that section of the istea: \u201cequal to the fee, not to exceed $10 per vehicle, that such State collected or charged as of November 15, 1991.\u201d The fundamental question before us is whether Michigan\u2019s reciprocity agreements should be considered in determining what fees were charged or collected as of November 15, 1991. We conclude that under the plain language of the statute, reciprocity agreements are not relevant in making that determination.</p>\n<p id=\"b214-6\">A</p>\n<p id=\"b214-7\">This is an issue of first impression for this Court; nor have any other state courts addressed it. The only court that has considered it is the District of Columbia Circuit Court of Appeals, <em>Nat'l Ass\u2019n of Regulatory Utility Comm\u2019rs, supra. </em>That court followed the ice\u2019s decision<footnotemark>9</footnotemark> to ban states from charging registration fees in excess of preexisting reciprocal discounts, saying:</p>\n<blockquote id=\"b215-4\"><page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"29\">*29</page-number>[W]e think the Commission was correct in concluding that the plain language of the statute precludes petitioners\u2019 interpretation. It does not matter whether Congress actually focused on the reciprocal discount practice or even was aware of it. Nor is it of any significance that the Commission initially misread the statute; that is what comment periods are for. <em>Id. </em>at 729.</blockquote>\n<p id=\"b215-5\">We are not bound to follow that decision,<footnotemark>10</footnotemark> and, for the reasons given below, we do not agree with the federal court\u2019s decision to defer to the ice\u2019s interpretation of the istea.</p>\n<p id=\"b215-6\">B</p>\n<p id=\"b215-7\">Plaintiff contends that in interpreting the istea we must give deference to the ice\u2019s interpretation. Because the issue is the interpretation of a federal statute and the deference due a federal agency\u2019s construction of that statute, we will apply the rules of construction set out by the federal judiciary.<footnotemark>11</footnotemark> The <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"30\">*30</page-number>seminal case is <em>Chevron, USA, Inc v Natural Resources Defense Council, Inc, </em>467 US 837; 104 S Ct 2778; 81 L Ed 2d 694 (1984). There the United States Supreme Court established that a court must first determine whether the statute\u2019s meaning is clear; if so, then the court must apply the statute as written. If the statute is ambiguous, then the court must give deference to the agency\u2019s interpretation.</p>\n<blockquote id=\"b216-6\">When a court reviews an agency\u2019s construction of the statute which it administers, it is confronted with two questions. First, always, is the question whether Congress has directly spoken to the precise question at issue. If the intent of Congress is clear, that is the end of the matter; for the court, as well as the agency, must give effect to the unambiguously expressed intent of Congress. If, however, the court determines Congress has not directly addressed the precise question at issue, the court does not simply impose its own construction on the statute, as would be necessary in the absence of an administrative interpretation. Rather, if the statute is silent or ambiguous with respect to the specific issue, the question for the court is whether the agency\u2019s answer is based on a permissible construction of the statute. <em>Id. </em>at 842-843.</blockquote>\n<p id=\"b216-7\">Here we find that the plain meaning of the terms of the istea is clear, and we apply the statute as written. Because we find that the statute is not ambiguous,<footnotemark>12</footnotemark> we need not proceed to the second step of <em>Chevron, </em><page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"31\">*31</page-number><em>supra, </em>and we do not reach the agency\u2019s interpretation.</p>\n<p id=\"b217-5\">c</p>\n<p id=\"b217-6\">The question before us is whether any then-existing reciprocity agreements should be considered when determining what fee the state charged or collected as of November 15, 1991. The ISTEA itself refers only to the fee collected or charged, and contains no reference to reciprocity agreements. 49 USC 11504(c)(2)(B)(iv)(III) directs the ICC to \u201cestablish a fee system\u201d that \u201cresult[s] in a fee for each participating State that is equal to the fee, not to exceed $10 per vehicle, that such State collected or charged as of November 15, 1991.\u201d The new \u201cfee system\u201d is based not on the fees collected from one individual company, but on the fee system that the state had in place on November 15, 1991. We must look not at the fees paid by plaintiff in any given year, but at the generic fee Michigan charged or collected from carriers as of November 15, 1991.</p>\n<p id=\"b217-7\">To determine what registration fee Michigan charged on November 15, 1991, we examine MCL 478.7(4) in the Motor Carrier Act. Since 1989 that statute has provided for a fee of $10 to be charged for those motor carrier vehicles operating in Michigan and licensed in another state or province of Canada:</p>\n<blockquote id=\"b217-8\">The annual fee levied on each interstate or foreign motor carrier vehicle operated in this state and licensed in another state or province of Canada shall be $10.00.</blockquote>\n<p id=\"b218-4\"><page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"32\">*32</page-number>The same statute, MCL 478.7(4), also gives the commission the ability to waive the $10 fee under certain circumstances:</p>\n<blockquote id=\"b218-5\">The commission may enter into a reciprocal agreement with a state or province of Canada that does not charge vehicles licensed in this state economic regulatory fees or taxes and may waive the fee required under this subsection.</blockquote>\n<p id=\"b218-6\">Thus, under MCL 478.7(4), the fee charged as of November 15, 1991, was $10. While that fee may be waived, and thus not \u201ccharged or collected,\u201d <em>for a particular carrier </em>under a reciprocity agreement, such voluntary agreements to waive the fee that happen to benefit a particular carrier do not affect the <em>generic </em>per vehicle fee in place on November 15, 1991. As stated, the clear focus of 49 USC 11506(c)(2)(B)(iv)(III) is on the generic \u201cfee\u201d that Michigan charged or collected as of November 15, 1991, and not on whether that fee was charged to or collected from a particular carrier.</p>\n<p id=\"b218-7\">The ice\u2019s position that \u201cparticipating States must consider fees charged or collected under reciprocity agreements when determining the fees charged or collected as of Nov 15, 1991, as required by \u00a7 11506(c)(2)(B)(iv),\u201d<footnotemark>13</footnotemark> added a concept not within the express language of the statute. It added consideration of voluntary agreements between the states to waive or reduce the fees imposed. It is not for the ICC, or this Court, to insert words into the statute.</p>\n<p id=\"b219-3\"><page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"33\">*33</page-number>m</p>\n<p id=\"b219-5\">We hold that Michigan\u2019s reciprocity agreements are not relevant in determining what fee was \u201ccharged or collected\u201d as of November 15, 1991. The lower courts erred in granting summary disposition for plaintiffs. We reverse the Court of Appeals decision, and remand this case to the Court of Claims for further proceedings consistent with this opinion.</p>\n<judges id=\"b219-6\">Corrigan, C.J., and Taylor, Young, and Markman, JJ., concurred with Weaver, J.</judges>\n<footnote label=\"1\">\n<p id=\"b211-7\"> Provisions similar to those in this section are now contained in 49 USC 14504.</p>\n</footnote>\n<footnote label=\"2\">\n<p id=\"b211-8\"> This was redesignated in 1996 as 49 CFR 367.</p>\n</footnote>\n<footnote label=\"3\">\n<p id=\"b211-9\"> The \u201cbingo card\u201d system served three main purposes: (1) to make it easier to determine whether a specific vehicle had been registered by simply looking at the \u201cbingo card,\u201d (2) to ensure compliance by interstate motor carriers to register all vehicles in operation, and (3) to prevent carriers from operating uninsured vehicles.</p>\n</footnote>\n<footnote label=\"4\">\n<p id=\"b212-8\"> In other words, Michigan would waive its registration fee for vehicles base-plated in a state that waived its fee for vehicles that were base-plated in Michigan.</p>\n</footnote>\n<footnote label=\"5\">\n<p id=\"b212-10\"> H R Conf Rep No 102-404, 102nd Cong, 1st Sess 437 (1991), reprinted in 1991 U S Code Cong &amp; Admin News, 1526, 1679, 1817.</p>\n</footnote>\n<footnote label=\"6\">\n<p id=\"b212-11\"> Participation in the SSRS was limited to the thirty-nine states that had elected to participate in the \u201cbingo card\u201d program. 49 USC 11506(c)(2)(D).</p>\n</footnote>\n<footnote label=\"7\">\n<p id=\"b213-8\"> At that time plaintiffs principal place of business was in Kansas, and it had 3,730 vehicles base-plated in Illinois and Indiana. Under Michigan\u2019s old reciprocity agreements, Michigan\u2019s fees for those 3,730 vehicles base-plated in Illinois and Indiana would have been waived. However, after Michigan changed its method for determining reciprocity to one based on a company\u2019s principal place of business, plaintiff was required to pay a $10 vehicle registration fee for each of the 3,730 vehicles. Thus, rather than paying nothing under the old reciprocity method, plaintiff was required to pay $37,300 annually under Michigan\u2019s new system.</p>\n</footnote>\n<footnote label=\"8\">\n<p id=\"b213-9\"> Plaintiff\u2019s complaint also sought attorney fees under 42 USC 1988. The Court of Claims did not grant this relief, and plaintiff has not appealed that decision to this Court.</p>\n</footnote>\n<footnote label=\"9\">\n<p id=\"b214-8\"> The ICC has taken varying positions on this issue. In its Advance Notice of Proposed Rulemaking, 57 Fed Reg 20,072 (1992), and its Notice of Proposed Rulemaking, 58 Fed Reg 5951 (1993), the ICC found that the reciprocity agreements were made voluntarily, and that there was no good reason for the ice\u2019s involvement in them. The ICC had noted that \u201cit might place a heavy administrative burden on a registration State were we to require that it collect from different carriers different fees from the same State depending on the various reciprocal agreements negotiated by the various states in which each carrier operates.\u201d 9 ICC2d 610, 617 (1993).</p>\n<p id=\"b214-9\">However, the ICC subsequently reversed its position, and now says \u201cwe have concluded that participating States must consider fees charged or collected under reciprocity agreements when determining the fees charged or collected as of Nov 15, 1991, as required by \u00a7 11506(c)(2)(B)(iv).\u201d Single State Insurance Registration Exparte No MC-100 (Sub-No 6), 9 ICC2d 610, 618-619 (1993).</p>\n</footnote>\n<footnote label=\"10\">\n<p id=\"b215-8\"> Michigan adheres to the rule that a state court is bound by the authoritative holdings of federal courts upon federal questions, including interpretations of federal statutes. See <em>Bement v Grand Rapids &amp; Indiana R Co, </em>194 Mich 64; 160 NW 424 (1916), and <em>In re Hopps Estate, </em>324 Mich 256; 36 NW2d 908 (1949). However, where there is no United States Supreme Court decision upon the interpretation in question, the lower federal courts\u2019 decisions, while entitled to respectful consideration, are not binding upon this Court. See <em>Winger v Grand Trunk W R Co, </em>210 Mich 100, 117; 177 NW 273 (1920), <em>Schueler v Weintrob, </em>360 Mich 621; 105 NW2d 42 (1960), and 21 CJS, Courts, \u00a7 159, pp 195-197.</p>\n</footnote>\n<footnote label=\"11\">\n<p id=\"b215-9\"> This Court has not previously determined what deference the courts of this state owe to a federal agency\u2019s interpretation of a federal statute. However, in that circumstance the Court of Appeals has applied the federal standards of deference as set out in <em>Chevron, supra </em>at 2778. See <em>Walker v Johnson &amp; Johnson Vision Products, Inc, </em>217 Mich App 705, 713; 552 NW2d 679 (1996), <em>Gibbs v General Motors Corp, </em>134 Mich App 429, 432; 351 NW2d 315 (1984), and 231 Mich App 200. This is also the approach taken by several other state courts. See for example: <em>Totemoff v State, </em>905 P2d 954, 967 (Alas, 1995), <em>Delorme v North Dakota Dep\u2019t of Human Services, </em>492 NW2d 585, 587, n 2 (ND, 1992), <em>Rodriguez v </em><page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"30\">*30</page-number><em>Perales, </em>86 NY2d 361, 367; 657 NE2d 247; 633 NYS2d 252 (1995), and <em>Bell Atlantic Mobile, Inc v Dep\u2019t of Public Utility Control, </em>253 Conn 453, 470; 754 A2d 128 (2000).</p>\n</footnote>\n<footnote label=\"12\">\n<p id=\"b216-9\"> The dissent contends that the statute is ambiguous, asserting that this is demonstrated by \u201cthe several interpretations of its wording advanced by the parties.\u201d If the parties\u2019 conflicting interpretations were the measure of a statute\u2019s ambiguity, then almost every statute litigated would be deemed ambiguous.

Consequently, I would affirm the decisions of the Court of Appeals and the Court of Claims.</p>\n<p id=\"b219-8\">The istea replaced the bingo card system of registering interstate motor carriers with a single state registration system. <em>Nat'l Ass\u2019n of Regulatory Utility Comm\u2019rs v Interstate Commerce </em>Comm, 309 US App DC 325, 328; 41 F3d 721 (1994). Under the istea system, a state can charge a fee \u201cthat is equal to the fee, not to exceed $10 per vehicle, that such State collected or charged as of November 15, 1991.\u201d 49 USC 11506(c)(2)(B)(iv)(III). The question in this case is <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"34\">*34</page-number>what effect reciprocity agreements have on determining the fee that Michigan can charge under the single state registration system.</p>\n<p id=\"b220-6\">As an initial point, I disagree with the majority\u2019s conclusion that the meaning of the language in the statute is plain, reasonably susceptible of only one interpretation. Rather, I find it ambiguous. A statute is ambiguous when reasonable minds could differ as to its meaning. <em>In re MCI Telecommunications Complaint, </em>460 Mich 396, 411; 596 NW2d 164 (1999). That the istea is ambiguous as regards the reciprocity agreements is demonstrated by the several interpretations of its wording advanced by the parties and by justices on this Court. The language of the statute supports both positions, allowing for opposing and similarly plausible constructions. Despite careful attention and analysis, reasonable minds can and do differ with respect to the statute\u2019s meaning concerning reciprocity agreements.</p>\n<p id=\"b220-7\">Alternatively, if the statute\u2019s language were plain, the meaning of the words \u201ccollected or charged\u201d must lead to a result opposite that reached by the majority. The majority concludes that Michigan was entitled to charge plaintiff a registration fee, but the majority\u2019s interpretation of the ISTEA depends on addition to the statute of words not present there. Whether the state of Michigan could have collected or charged a \u201cgeneric\u201d per vehicle fee is not pertinent. The statute specifies \u201cfees . . . collected or charged as of November 15, 1991.\u201d It does not say \u201cfees that the state could have collected or charged.\u201d</p>\n<p id=\"b220-8\">WTiile the istea does not expressly make reference to reciprocity agreements, the fee system in place on November 15, 1991, does. MCL 478.7(4) provides:</p>\n<blockquote id=\"b221-4\"><page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"35\">*35</page-number>The annual fee levied on each interstate or foreign motor carrier vehicle operated in this state and licensed in another state or province of Canada shall be $10.00. The commission may enter into a reciprocal agreement with a state or province of Canada that does not charge vehicles licensed in this state economic regulatory fees or taxes and may waive the fee required under this subsection.</blockquote>\n<p id=\"b221-5\">A plain reading of this provision leads to the conclusion that reciprocity agreements are an inherent part of the state\u2019s registration fee system. The generic fee levied under the statute is not absolute, but subject to reciprocity agreements that waive the fee. Thus, the fee charged as of November 15, 1991, was $10.00, unless a reciprocity agreement pertained. Voluntary agreements to waive the fee are relevant in determining the per vehicle fee system in place on November 15, 1991, as well as the fee collected or charged pursuant to that system.</p>\n<p id=\"b221-6\">The parties do not dispute that Michigan had a reciprocity agreement with Illinois that, by its terms, waived Michigan registration fees for interstate motor carriers licensed in Illinois. Pursuant to the agreement, the state did not charge registration fees for plaintiff\u2019s vehicles in 1990 and in 1991. It was not until Michigan revised its reciprocity system in 1991 that it charged plaintiff a registration fee.</p>\n<p id=\"b221-7\">This change in the reciprocity system did not become effective until the 1992 registration year. Plaintiff was not charged a registration fee in Michigan, nor was one collected from it in Michigan for the 1991 registration year. The fact that the state had a right to or could have charged a \u201cgeneric\u201d registration fee does not change the fact: it did not charge plaintiff a fee until the 1992 registration year.</p>\n<p id=\"b222-5\"><page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"36\">*36</page-number>The majority\u2019s characterization of the language of the statute as \u201cplain\u201d is belied by the fact that the majority is obliged to construe the phrase \u201ccollected or charged\u201d to reach its result. Only a strained reading of \u201ccollected or charged\u201d leads to the conclusion that the state charged a fee when it did not do so. That the statute does not expressly mention reciprocity agreements does not change the fact that reciprocity agreements were an inherent part of the fee system in place on November 15, 1991. In this case, the reciprocity agreement with Illinois in effect during the 1991 registration year caused Michigan to waive the fees it might have imposed under MCL 478.7. As a consequence, no fees had been \u201ccollected or charged as of November 15, 1991.\u201d</p>\n<p id=\"b222-6\">The Court should give deference, as did the District of Columbia Circuit Court of Appeals,<footnotemark>2</footnotemark> to the Interstate Commerce Commission\u2019s construction of the language in question, because it is based on a permissible construction of the istea. <em>Chevron, USA, Inc v Natural Resources Defense Council, Inc, </em>467 US 837, 842-844; 104 S Ct 2778; 81 L Ed 2d 694 (1984).

I disagree with the majority\u2019s conclusion that the relevant provision of the federal Intermodal Surface Transportation Efficiency Act (istea), 49 USC 11506(c)(2)(B)(iv)(III), is unambiguous and that this Court is free to decide that the section does not take into account reciprocity agreements. Rather, I conclude that this provision is ambiguous, and that the Interstate Commerce Com<page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"37\">*37</page-number>mission (ICC) has permissibly construed it to take into account reciprocity agreements. Under <em>Chevron, USA, Inc v Natural Resources Defense Council, Inc, </em>467 US 837; 104 S Ct 2778; 81 L Ed 2d 694 (1984), then, this Court should defer to the ice\u2019s interpretation of that provision. I, therefore, would affirm the judgment of the Court of Appeals, and must respectfully dissent.</p>\n<p id=\"b223-4\">In this case, the Court is called on to review a federal statute that was administered by the ICC when this case arose.<footnotemark>1</footnotemark> As the majority points out, under the Supreme Court\u2019s decision in <em>Chevron, </em>when a court reviews an agency\u2019s construction of a statute the agency administers, the court faces a two-part inquiry. First, the court must determine whether the statute clearly and unambiguously expresses the legislative intent. If so, it then must give effect to the statute as written. However, if the statute is not clear and unambiguous, the court \u201cdoes not simply impose its own construction on the statute,\u201d but instead reviews whether the agency has permissibly construed the statute. If it has, the court should defer to the agency\u2019s construction. <em>Chevron </em>at 842-843. As alluded, the ICC, in <em>Single State Insurance Registration, </em>9 ICC2d 610, 618-619 (1993), construed the statute in question to take into account reciprocity agreements that exempted some interstate carriers from state fees, a conclusion opposite to that reached by the majority.</p>\n<p id=\"b224-5\"><page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"38\">*38</page-number>To determine whether a statute clearly and unambiguously expresses legislative intent, courts begin with the statutory language. If the words of a statute are clear and unambiguous, the court must apply them as written, and no further judicial construction is required or permitted. See, e.g., <em>Tryc v Michigan </em>Veterans\u2019 <em>Facility, </em>451 Mich 129, 135; 545 NW2d 642 (1996) . However, when there can be reasonable disagreement over a statute\u2019s meaning, see <em>People v Adair, </em>452 Mich 473, 479; 550 NW2d 505 (1996), or, as others have put it, when a statute is capable of being understood by reasonably well-informed persons in two or more different senses, that statute is ambiguous. See 2A Singer, Statutes &amp; Statutory Construction (6th ed), \u00a7 45.02, pp 11-12. For example, this Court has concluded that statutes have been ambiguous when one word in the statute has an unclear meaning, see <em>Perez v Keeler Brass Co, </em>461 Mich 602, 610; 608 NW2d 45 (2000), when a statute\u2019s interaction with another statute has rendered its meaning unclear, see <em>People v Denio, </em>454 Mich 691, 699; 564 NW2d 13 (1997) , or when application of the statute to facts has rendered the correct application of the statute uncertain, see <em>Elias Bros v Treasury Dep\u2019t, </em>452 Mich 144, 150; 549 NW2d 837 (1996).</p>\n<p id=\"b224-8\">In this case, the majority concludes that the governing istea provision is plain and unambiguous. In the words of our prior decisions, then, the majority concludes that there cannot be reasonable disagreement over the statute\u2019s meaning, and that reasonably well-informed people cannot understand the statute in two or more different senses. Before amendment, the governing section provided that the ICC, and through it, states</p>\n<blockquote id=\"b225-3\"><page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"39\">*39</page-number>shall establish a fee system for the filing of proof of insurance as provided under subparagraph (A)(ii) of this paragraph that (I) will be based on the number of commercial motor vehicles the carrier operates in a State and on the number of States in which the carrier operates, (II) will minimize the costs of complying with the registration system, and (III) will result in a fee for each participating State that is equal to the fee, not to exceed $10 per vehicle, that such State collected or charged as of November 15, 1991 .... [49 USC 11506(c)(2)(B)(iv).]</blockquote>\n<p id=\"b225-4\">I cannot agree that the meaning of this language is clear and unambiguous. Rather, it is subject to reasonable disagreement.</p>\n<p id=\"b225-5\">The majority concludes that the fee \u201ccollected or charged\u201d refers only to the fee system a state had in place on November 15, 1991, and that this is clear from the plain meaning of \u00a7 11506(c)(2)(B)(iv). See <em>ante </em>at 31-32. However, the conclusion that the fee \u201ccollected or charged\u201d refers only to the fee system requires that \u201ccollected or charged\u201d include the possibility that the fee \u201ccharged\u201d can be simultaneously \u201cwaived.\u201d <em>Id. </em>at 32. Otherwise, there would be no question that the state had not collected or charged anything from plaintiff until the changes in the reciprocity system became effective in 1992, after the cutoff date provided in \u00a7 11506. The conclusion that a fee can be \u201ccharged,\u201d yet concurrently \u201cwaived,\u201d though, is not consistent with this Court\u2019s approach to plain language.</p>\n<p id=\"b225-6\">When construing a statute according to its plain language, unless the statute itself dictates otherwise, this Court generally turns to dictionary definitions of the statutory terms to find those terms\u2019 ordinary and generally accepted meanings. See, e.g., <em>Denio </em>at 699. Applying this approach to the instant case calls the <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"40\">*40</page-number>majority\u2019s conclusion that a fee can be simultaneously \u201ccharged\u201d and waived into question. \u201cCharge\u201d is defined variably as (1) \u201cTo hold financially liable; demand payment from,\u201d (2) \u201cTo demand or ask payment,\u201d (3) \u201cA financial burden, as a tax or lien,\u201d (4) \u201cTo set or ask (a given amount) as a price,\u201d (5) \u201cExpense; cost,\u201d or (6) \u201cThe price set or asked for something.\u201d <em>The American Heritage Dictionary </em>(2d College ed, 1982).</p>\n<p id=\"b226-4\">The problem in this case is that the ordinary and generally accepted meanings of the term \u201ccharge\u201d do not dictate the majority\u2019s conclusion. Rather, the definitions of \u201ccharge\u201d present a spectrum of concepts ranging from those that might encompass the majority understanding that a fee can be \u201ccharged\u201d but concurrently \u201cwaived\u201d \u2014 definitions 4, 6, and arguably 5\u2014 to those that do not encompass that understanding because they require that the charge be a \u201cdemand\u201d or a \u201cburden.\u201d Definitions 1, 2, and 3 do not support the majority\u2019s conclusion because, under those meanings of \u201ccharge,\u201d the state would have to waive a fee, yet also hold a carrier financially liable for it, or demand or ask for payment of a fee that had been waived. Similarly, if a fee has been \u201cwaived,\u201d it is not a financial burden on the party responsible for the fee. In this case, plaintiff was not made financially liable for, or financially burdened with, the waived fee, and the state did not demand the waived fee before November 15, 1991. Thus, although several accepted definitions of \u201ccharge\u201d support the majority conclusion, several others weigh against it.</p>\n<p id=\"b226-5\">As mentioned above, the meaning of a facially unambiguous term can be ambiguous in certain circumstances. See <em>Denio </em>at 699; <em>Perez </em>at 610. Thus, <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"41\">*41</page-number>although \u201ccharged\u201d may not at first blush appear ambiguous, in the context of a fee that was established in a fee system, but never demanded because of a reciprocity agreement, \u201ccharged\u201d is ambiguous because the fee may or may not fit the definition of a fee that is \u201ccharged.\u201d If the statutory term \u201ccharged\u201d is narrow and requires a demand for payment, the state had not charged plaintiff the fees before November 15, 1991, and cannot charge plaintiff for later years. On the other hand, if \u201ccharged\u201d is broad and requires only the setting of a fee, the state had charged the fee by the cutoff date, and plaintiff cannot avoid payment. Compare <em>Perez </em>at 610 (\u201crefuses\u201d could have a broa.d or narrow meaning).</p>\n<p id=\"b227-4\">Although it does so without explanation, the majority chooses the latter meaning, concluding that even when the fee was waived for particular carriers, it still had been charged in general. <em>Ante </em>at 32. I do not contend that the majority has chosen the wrong definition of \u201ccharge,\u201d or that its conclusion about \u00a7 11506\u2019s meaning is unreasonable. However, for the majority to come to its conclusion, it had to resolve the ambiguity surrounding the meaning of the statutory term \u201ccharged,\u201d specifically, whether \u201ccharged\u201d was used in its broad or narrow sense.<footnotemark>2</footnotemark> Normally, this <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"42\">*42</page-number>Court has a duty to make such a decision. In this case, however, the different possible meanings of \u201ccharged\u201d present an ambiguity in \u00a7 11506. Under <em>Chevron, </em>rather than this Court imposing its own construction on the statute, we must consider whether the ICC, the agency responsible for administering this statute and which has already resolved this ambiguity in \u00a7 11506, did so permissibly.</p>\n<p id=\"b228-6\">I conclude that the ICC did permissibly construe the statute, and, therefore, I would defer to that agency. In <em>Single State, </em>the ICC considered whether the freeze on registration fees enacted through the istea should take reciprocity agreements into account. It decided that the istea does take reciprocity agreements into account when freezing the fees that states \u201ccharged.\u201d Thus, an interstate carrier that was not charged any fees before November 15, 1991, because it was operating under a reciprocity agreement, could not be charged fees after that time. See <em>Single State, supra </em>at 617-619. This interpretation evidences that the ICC preferred the narrow approach to \u201ccharged,\u201d concluding that an interstate carrier had not been \u201ccharged\u201d a registration fee unless a state had made a demand for the fee, or unless the carrier had been held financially liable for the fee. Under reciprocity agreements, states did not make demands for fees, and did not hold carriers hable for fees. Hence, carriers operating under those agreements were not \u201ccharged\u201d before the cutoff date, and could not be charged after it. <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"43\">*43</page-number>Though this Court may not prefer the ice\u2019s inteipretation of \u00a7 11506 or the narrow approach to the term \u201ccharged,\u201d in light of the different possible meanings of the statute, the ICC approach is certainly a permissible construction. I would, therefore, defer to that agency\u2019s interpretation of this section.</p>\n<p id=\"b229-4\">In sum, I disagree with the majority\u2019s conclusion that 49 USC 11506 is not reasonably subject to different understandings. Whether the statutory term \u201ccharged\u201d is understood narrowly or broadly affects this statute\u2019s meaning. Because the statute can be understood differently, this Court\u2019s only role is to consider whether the federal agency responsible for administering this statute, which has already considered the question before this Court, permissibly answered that question. The ICC took a narrow view of the meaning of \u201ccharged,\u201d but nevertheless a view that is supported by \u00a7 11506. I would defer to that agency\u2019s view and, therefore, must respectfully dissent.</p>\n<footnote label=\"1\">\n<p id=\"b223-5\"> The ICC was abolished in 1996, and the references to the ICC in the governing statute, which was recodified, were changed to refer to the Secretary of Transportation. See 49 USC 14505; see also PL 104-88, 109 Stat 803, tit I, \u00a7 103.</p>\n</footnote>\n<footnote label=\"2\">\n<p id=\"b227-5\"> To conclude that the fee \u201ccharged\u201d refers only to the fee set by the fee system, the majority must nevertheless conclude that \u201ccharged\u201d is broad, meaning only that the state \u201cset a price\u201d for carriers but did not hold a carrier liable for that price. Such an understanding comports only with definitions 4 and 6 above, but not the narrower meaning of \u201ccharge\u201d in definitions 1, 2, and 3. Otherwise, the fee \u201ccharged\u201d could refer to only a particular fee and not the system itself.</p>\n<p id=\"b227-6\">Further, if the majority is correct that the fee charged refers only to the fee system in place, but not the fees charged of particular carriers, then apparently Michigan could waive fees for every carrier operating in the state, under reciprocity agreements or not, but nevertheless continue to <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"42\">*42</page-number>be said to \u201ccharge\u201d a generic fee. In such a scenario, the majority would apparently conclude that Michigan \u201ccharged\u201d a fee even though it held no carrier financially liable for any fee.</p>\n<p id=\"AVj\">Again, there is room for reasonable disagreement over the proper understanding of these statutory terms. That room for disagreement, though, indicates that we should defer to the icc understanding.</p>\n</footnote>\n</opinion>\n</casebody>\n",
