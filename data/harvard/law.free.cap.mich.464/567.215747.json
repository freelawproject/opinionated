The Court of Appeals reversed defendant\u2019s convictions because of testimony from a police detective that referenced defendant\u2019s refusal to submit to police questioning. While the testimony was inappropriate, we conclude that it did not amount to a violation of defendant\u2019s constitutional right to due process and that the trial court did not abuse its discretion by denying defendant\u2019s motion for a mistrial. Accordingly, we reverse the judgment of the Court of Appeals and reinstate defendant\u2019s convictions.</p>\n<p id=\"b755-6\">i</p>\n<p id=\"b755-7\">On the afternoon of August 23, 1997, defendant was a passenger in a van that was stopped by the police. A police officer observed that defendant was sitting with an object that turned out to be a safe between his legs. Eventually, the police called for a drug sniffing dog to be brought to the scene. At that point, defendant became \u201cextremely enraged\u201d and was placed in the back of a police car. After being placed in the police car, defendant kicked out its rear window, completely shattering the window. Eventu<page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"570\">*570</page-number>ally, the dog was brought inside the van, and it alerted to the safe. Later, the police opened the safe and found several packets of cocaine, a small amount of marijuana, a loaded \u201cTech Nine\u201d handgun, and over $2,000 in cash.<footnotemark>1</footnotemark> This led to the present charges and convictions against defendant.</p>\n<p id=\"b756-5\">At issue now is the following testimony from defendant\u2019s trial that transpired during the direct examination of police detective Kent Cooper by the prosecutor after eliciting testimony that defendant had been arrested:</p>\n<blockquote id=\"b756-6\"><em>Q. </em>What type of investigation follow-up did you do with regard to this?</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b756-7\"><em>A. </em>I went out and attempted to interview [defendant], and at that time it was refused. He wished to speak to an attorney prior to me asking him any questions.</blockquote>\n<p id=\"b756-8\">We note that the trial record does not include any express mention that defendant had been advised of his Miranda<footnotemark>2</footnotemark> rights to remain silent and to have an attorney present during custodial interrogation. However, the prosecution has effectively stipulated that defendant was in police custody following his arrest at the time of the attempted questioning and had been advised of his <em>Miranda </em>rights before rejecting Detec<page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"571\">*571</page-number>tive Cooper\u2019s attempt to interview him.<footnotemark>3</footnotemark> Accordingly, our decision presumes that defendant\u2019s refusal to submit to police questioning constituted <em>\u201cpost-Miranda*\u2019 </em>silence.</p>\n<p id=\"b757-5\">Defense counsel requested a mistrial on the basis of Detective Cooper\u2019s testimony about defendant refusing to be questioned before speaking with an attorney. The trial court denied this request, stating that it was convinced the prosecutor did not intend to elicit testimony on this point and that it did not think \u201cthe jury picked it up or caught it in any way.\u201d</p>\n<p id=\"b757-6\">In its final instructions to the jury, the trial court provided the following curative instruction with regard to Detective Cooper\u2019s testimony referencing defendant\u2019s refusal to submit to a police interview:</p>\n<blockquote id=\"b757-7\">Also, at one time Detective Cooper made mention of the fact that when we [sic] went out to the jail to talk to [defendant], [defendant] did not want to talk to him and [defendant] said that he wanted a lawyer.</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b757-8\">This is an absolute right that every citizen of this country has. In fact, if Officer Cooper had talked to [defendant], he would have had to tell [defendant] before he even started talking that [defendant] had a right to refuse to talk, and [defendant] had a right to have a lawyer present when he was talking to the officer.</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b757-9\">So the fact that [defendant] said he wanted a lawyer and didn\u2019t want to talk to the officer cannot be used by you in any way and is not any indication of anything. It\u2019s a constitutional right that every citizen of this country has.</blockquote>\n<p id=\"Avm\"><page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"572\">*572</page-number>n</p>\n<p id=\"b758-5\">Defendant argued before the Court of Appeals that the trial court improperly denied his motion for a mistrial. The Court of Appeals agreed with that conclusion. It treated the improper testimony from Detective Cooper as constituting a preserved claim of constitutional error that requires reversal unless it was harmless beyond a reasonable doubt. The Court stated that it could not conclude the error was harmless beyond a reasonable doubt and, accordingly, held that the trial court abused its discretion by denying defendant\u2019s motion for a mistrial. Unpublished opinion per curiam, issued April 14, 2000 (Docket No. 215244).</p>\n<p id=\"b758-6\">In its appeal to this Court, the prosecution argues that there was no constitutional violation because the prosecution did not attempt to use defendant\u2019s post-<em>Miranda </em>silence against him and that the trial court did not abuse its discretion by denying defendant\u2019s motion for a mistrial. As we will explain below, we agree.</p>\n<p id=\"b758-7\">HI</p>\n<p id=\"b758-8\">We review a trial court\u2019s decision to deny a motion for a mistrial for an abuse of discretion. See, e.g., <em>People v Grove, </em>455 Mich 439, 475-476; 566 NW2d 547 (1997).</p>\n<p id=\"b758-9\">In <em>Miranda v Arizona, </em>384 US 436; 865 S Ct 1602; 16 L Ed 2d 694 (1966), the United States Supreme Court articulated the rule that the police must advise a suspect before custodial interrogation that the suspect has the right to remain silent, that anything the suspect says may be used against him, and that the <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"573\">*573</page-number>suspect has a right to the presence of retained or, if indigent, appointed counsel during questioning.<footnotemark>4</footnotemark> To be clear, the present case does not involve any allegation of a violation of <em>Miranda </em>itself because there is no claim that defendant was interrogated by the police without being afforded the warnings required by <em>Miranda. </em>Neither does this case involve any other type of claim under the Self-Incrimination Clause of the Fifth Amendment, inasmuch as there is no claim that any involuntary statement by defendant was used against him.</p>\n<p id=\"b759-5\">Rather, properly understood, the present case involves a question regarding whether the testimony at issue from Detective Cooper violates defendant\u2019s constitutional right to due process under the Fourteenth Amendment. In <em>Doyle v Ohio, </em>426 US 610, 619; 96 S Ct 2240; 49 L Ed 2d 91 (1976), the United States Supreme Court held that the use of a criminal defendant\u2019s silence \u201cat the time of arrest and after receiving <em>Miranda </em>warnings\u201d for impeachment purposes violates the Due Process Clause of the Fourteenth Amendment of the United States Constitution.</p>\n<p id=\"b759-6\">The <em>Doyle </em>Court explained that silence in the face of <em>Miranda </em>warnings cannot be used as evidence<footnotemark>5</footnotemark> to cast doubt on the defendant\u2019s credibility for two basic reasons. First, silence in the face of <em>Miranda </em>wam-<page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"574\">*574</page-number>ings may reflect nothing more than an exercise of <em>Miranda </em>rights (as opposed to being any implicit acknowledgment of guilt):</p>\n<blockquote id=\"b760-5\">Silence in the wake of these warnings may be nothing more than the arrestee\u2019s exercise of these <em>Miranda </em>rights. Thus, every post-arrest silence is insolubly ambiguous because of what the State is required to advise the person arrested. <em>[Doyle, supra </em>at 617.]</blockquote>\n<p id=\"b760-6\">Second, the <em>Miranda </em>warnings carry an implicit assurance that silence in reliance on those warnings will not be penalized:</p>\n<blockquote id=\"b760-7\">Moreover, while it is true that the <em>Miranda </em>warnings contain no express assurance that silence will carry no penalty, such assurance is implicit to any person who receives the warnings. In such circumstances, it would be fundamentally unfair and a deprivation of due process to allow the arrested person\u2019s silence to be used to impeach an explanation subsequently offered at trial. <em>[Doyle, supra </em>at 618.]</blockquote>\n<p id=\"b760-8\">Accordingly, the <em>Doyle </em>Court quoted with approval the statement in Justice White\u2019s concurrence in <em>United States v Hale, </em>422 US 171, 183-184; 95 S Ct 2133; 45 L Ed 2d 99 (1975), that \u201cit seems to me that it does not comport with due process to permit the prosecution during the trial to call attention to [the defendant\u2019s] silence at the time of arrest . . after the defendant has received <em>Miranda </em>warnings. <em>Doyle, supra </em>at 620. The <em>Doyle </em>Court reversed the convictions of the defendants on the basis of the prosecution\u2019s conduct in using their <em>post-Miranda </em>silence against them.</p>\n<p id=\"b760-9\">The circumstances of the present case differ greatly from those of <em>Doyle. </em>In <em>Doyle, </em>the prosecution unabashedly used the silence of each of the two <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"575\">*575</page-number>defendants in the face of <em>Miranda </em>warnings against them at their respective trials. The prosecution repeatedly asked each defendant questions to emphasize that he did not provide an exculpatory version of events to the police after being arrested. In contrast, the present case involves a single question and answer in which Detective Cooper revealed in response to an open-ended question that defendant had refused to be interviewed by the detective before speaking with an attorney.</p>\n<p id=\"Abo\">We recognize that Detective Cooper\u2019s answer may not reasonably be viewed as nonresponsive to the prosecutor\u2019s open-ended question asking about the \u201ctype of investigation follow-up\u201d pursued by the detective. Detective Cooper\u2019s reply about his attempt to interview defendant described something that he did in attempting to investigate the case after defendant was arrested. On the other hand, there is nothing to reasonably support a conclusion that the prosecutor intended for this question to elicit a reference to the attempted interview. Immediately after the detective\u2019s answer referencing defendant\u2019s refusal of the police interview, the detective began testifying about his other investigative efforts. In our view, it is evident that the prosecutor\u2019s question, while it may have been inartfully phrased, was aimed at eliciting testimony about these investigative efforts, not about the defendant\u2019s refusal of a police interview.<footnotemark>6</footnotemark></p>\n<p id=\"b762-4\"><page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"576\">*576</page-number>In considering the implication of the substantial difference between this case and <em>Doyle, </em>we are guided by the intervening decision of the United States Supreme Court in <em>Greer v Miller, </em>483 US 756; 107 S Ct 3102; 97 L Ed 2d 618 (1987). In <em>Greer, </em>the defendant<footnotemark>7</footnotemark> testified at his trial, claiming that he was innocent of the murder and related crimes charged and providing an exculpatory version of events that implicated two others as the perpetrators. <em>Id. </em>at 758. During the prosecutor\u2019s cross-examination of the defendant, he asked, \u201cwhy didn\u2019t you tell this story to anybody when you got arrested?\u201d <em>Id. </em>at 759. Defense counsel immediately objected, and the trial court sustained the objection and instructed the jury to ignore the question. Importantly, the prosecution did not pursue the inquiry further or mention it during closing argument. In its jury instructions, the trial court told the jury to disregard questions about which objections were sustained. <em>Id.</em></p>\n<p id=\"b762-5\">The United States Supreme Court in <em>Greer </em>held that, despite the prosecutor asking an improper question, no actual violation of <em>Doyle </em>occurred. <em>Greer, supra </em>at 764-765. The Court explained:</p>\n<blockquote id=\"b762-6\">[T]he trial court in this case did not permit the inquiry that <em>Doyle </em>forbids. Instead, the court explicitly sustained an</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b763-4\"><page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"577\">*577</page-number>objection to the only question that touched upon Miller\u2019s postarrest silence. No further questioning or argument with respect to Miller\u2019s silence occurred, and the court specifically advised the jury that it should disregard any questions to which an objection was sustained. Unlike the prosecutor in <em>Doyle, </em>the prosecutor in this case was not \u201callowed to undertake impeachment on,\u201d or \u201cpermit[ted] ... to call attention to,\u201d Miller\u2019s silence. The fact of Miller\u2019s postarrest silence was not submitted to the jury as evidence from which it was allowed to draw any permissible inference, and thus no <em>Doyle </em>violation occurred in this case. <em>[Id., </em>citation omitted.]</blockquote>\n<p id=\"b763-5\">Thus, the Court held that the prosecutor\u2019s improper question did not require reversal of the defendant\u2019s convictions. <em>Id. </em>at 761. Notably, the <em>Greer </em>Court emphasized that \u201c[i]t is significant that in each of the cases in which this Court has applied <em>Doyle, </em>the trial court has permitted specific inquiry or argument respecting the defendant\u2019s <em>post-Miranda </em>silence.\u201d <em>Id. </em>at 764.</p>\n<p id=\"b763-6\">We conclude that the circumstances of this case are analogous to <em>Greer </em>and that no <em>Doyle </em>violation actually occurred. Indeed, the conduct of the prosecutor in <em>Greer </em>was far worse in that he attempted to directly inject the defendant\u2019s silence into the defendant\u2019s trial while the prosecutor in the present case inadvertently elicited testimony about the present defendant\u2019s refusal to submit to a police interview. As in <em>Greer, </em>apart from the single impropriety, the prosecution did not call attention to defendant\u2019s silence. While the dissent essentially hypothesizes that the jury may have drawn some type of negative inference from the willingness of other witnesses to speak to Detective Cooper, the prosecution never made such an argument to the jmy. In our view, it would be <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"578\">*578</page-number>strained to believe that the prosecution intended to draw \u2014 or that the jury actually drew \u2014 such an implicit \u201ccomparison\u201d from Detective Cooper\u2019s testimony which was overwhelmingly focused on presenting expert testimony about the drug trade. There was no further questioning or argument regarding defendant\u2019s silence. Thus, the trial court did not allow (or have occasion to allow) any specific inquiry or argument about defendant\u2019s <em>post-Miranda </em>silence. Further, because defendant in the present case did not testify, there was obviously no attempt to.use his prior silence for impeachment purposes.<footnotemark>8</footnotemark> Moreover, the trial court gave a forceful curative instruction to the jury that defendant saying he wanted a lawyer and did not wish to talk with the officer \u201ccannot be used by you in any way and is not an indication of anything.\u201d Thus, as in <em>Greer, </em>\u201c[t]he fact of [the defendant\u2019s] postarrest silence was not submitted to the jury as evidence from which it was allowed to draw any permissible inference . . . .\u201d <em>Id. </em>at 764.</p>\n<p id=\"b764-5\">Critical to our conclusion is that <em>Doyle </em>prohibits \u201cthe use for impeachment purposes of [a defendant\u2019s] silence, at the time of arrest and after receiving <em>Miranda </em>warnings . . . .\u201d <em>Doyle, supra </em>at 619. Because defendant did not testify, the testimony at issue by Detective Cooper could not possibly have been used against defendant for impeachment purposes. Thus, this is not a case like <em>Doyle </em>in which the prosecution essentially attempted to use a defendant\u2019s <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"579\">*579</page-number><em>post-Miranda </em>silence to further an argument that the defendant presented a fabricated version of events on the basis of hearing the evidence presented by the prosecution at trial. This reinforces that the prosecution did not use defendant\u2019s <em>post-Miranda </em>silence against him in this case.</p>\n<p id=\"b765-4\">We note that our conclusion that no <em>Doyle </em>violation occurred in this case is supported by the decision of the United States Court of Appeals for the Eleventh Circuit in <em>United States v Stubbs, </em>944 F2d 828 (CA 11, 1991). That case similarly involved improper testimony by a witness in response to an open-ended question. The prosecutor asked a prosecution witness what happened after she talked to a federal agent. In her answer, the witness said that the agent told her that the defendant would not \u201csay anything.\u201d <em>Id. </em>at 834. As in the present case, the prosecution in <em>Stubbs </em>did not attempt to draw out further information about the defendant\u2019s cooperation with the police and never mentioned the issue during closing argument. However, the defendant argued on appeal that the testimony improperly commented on her postarrest refusal to talk with the police in violation of <em>Doyle. </em>The Eleventh Circuit concluded that no <em>Doyle </em>violation occurred:</p>\n<blockquote id=\"b765-5\">While a single comment alone may sometimes constitute a <em>Doyle </em>violation,[<footnotemark>9</footnotemark>] the Supreme Court\u2019s opinion in <em>Greer </em>makes clear that a single mention does not automatically suffice to violate defendant\u2019s rights when the government does not specifically and expressly attempt to <em>use </em>\u2014 as was <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"580\">*580</page-number>attempted in <em>Doyle </em>and in <em>Greer</em>\u2014the improper comment to impeach the defendant See <em>Lindgren v Lane, </em>925 F2d 198, 201 (CA 7, 1991) (\u201cAs explained in <em>Greer v Miller, </em>it is the use of an accused\u2019s silence against him at trial by way of <em>specific inquiry or impeachment </em>that forms the basis for a violation of the Fourteenth Amendment.\u201d) (emphasis added). As was the case in <em>Greer, </em>the prosecutor here \u201cwas not allowed to undertake impeachment on, or permitted to call attention to [defendant\u2019s] silence.\u201d <em>Greer, </em>483 US at 764 (citation omitted). The prosecution made no \u201cspecific inquiry or argument\u201d about defendant\u2019s postarrest silence. <em>Id. </em>Accordingly, we conclude there was no <em>Doyle </em>violation in this case. <em>[Stubbs, supra </em>at 835 (emphasis in original).]</blockquote>\n<p id=\"b766-8\">As in <em>Stubbs, </em>the present case involved no specific inquiry by the prosecution regarding defendant\u2019s silence or any attempt to use that silence for impeachment purposes. Accordingly, <em>Stubbs </em>reinforces our conclusion that there was no violation of defendant\u2019s constitutional right to due process under <em>Doyle </em>in the present case.<footnotemark>10</footnotemark></p>\n<p id=\"b766-9\">We acknowledge that, as argued by defendant, this case differs from <em>Greer </em>in that a witness actually testified in the presence of the jury that defendant re<page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"581\">*581</page-number>fused to submit to police questioning. Essentially, defendant contends that this circumstance makes this case worse than <em>Greer </em>and involves an actual <em>Doyle </em>violation because evidence of the defendant\u2019s silence was actually placed before the jury as opposed to a question that merely insinuated such silence. However, we do not accept this argument. The prosecutor in the present case made no effort to use the testimony about defendant\u2019s silence against him. In contrast, the prosecutor in <em>Greer </em>insinuated that the defendant\u2019s testimony in that case was questionable because he did not provide his story to the police at an earlier point. If the prosecutor\u2019s conduct in <em>Greer </em>did not constitute \u201cuse\u201d of the defendant\u2019s silence against him, then neither did the inadvertently elicited testimony in this case.<footnotemark>11</footnotemark></p>\n<p id=\"b767-5\">In light of our conclusion that there was no violation of defendant\u2019s due process rights under <em>Doyle, </em>we hold that the trial court did not abuse its discretion in denying defendant\u2019s motion for a mistrial. As the <em>Greer </em>Court stated, \u201cwe normally presume that a jury will follow an instruction to disregard inadmissible evidence inadvertently presented to it, unless there is an \u2018overwhelming probability\u2019 that the jury will be unable to follow the court\u2019s instructions, and a strong likelihood that the effect of. the evidence would be \u2018devastating\u2019 to the defendant.\u201d <em>Id. </em>at 767, n 8 (citations omitted). The trial court in the present <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"582\">*582</page-number>case emphatically instructed the jury to place no weight on defendant\u2019s invocation of his <em>Miranda </em>rights. Thus, it was reasonable for the trial court to conclude that any possible prejudice from the improper testimony from Detective Cooper could be cured with a cautionary instruction and that a mistrial was not required.<footnotemark>12</footnotemark></p>\n<p id=\"b768-6\">For the foregoing reasons, we disagree with the Court of Appeals decision to reverse defendant\u2019s convictions.<footnotemark>13</footnotemark></p>\n<p id=\"b768-7\">Our judgment that the circumstances of the present case do not warrant reversal of defendant\u2019s convictions should in no way be taken as condoning the inappropriate injection of a defendant\u2019s exercise of the <em>Miranda </em>rights into a trial by either prosecutors <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"583\">*583</page-number>or the police. In the present case, considering (1) the limited nature of the improper testimony, (2) the lack of any effort by the prosecution to improperly use defendant\u2019s invocation of the <em>Miranda </em>rights against him, (3) the strong curative instruction used by the trial court, and (4) that defendant did not testify so there is no concern of his <em>post-Miranda </em>silence having been used for impeachment purposes, we conclude that there was no constitutional violation and that the trial court did not abuse its discretion by declining to order a mistrial.</p>\n<p id=\"b769-5\">IV</p>\n<p id=\"b769-6\">In sum, we conclude that the inadvertent elicitation of testimony that defendant exercised his <em>Miranda </em>right to decline police questioning without the presence of counsel did not constitute a violation of defendant\u2019s constitutional right to due process under <em>Doyle. </em>The circumstances of this case did not involve use by the prosecution of defendant\u2019s <em>post-Miranda </em>silence against him within the meaning of <em>Doyle </em>and <em>Greer. </em>Thus, we reverse the judgment of the Court of Appeals and reinstate defendant\u2019s convictions.</p>\n<judges id=\"b769-7\">Corrigan, C.J., and Weaver, Young, and Markman, JJ., concurred with Taylor, J.</judges>\n<footnote label=\"1\">\n<p id=\"b756-9\"> Notably, defendant had also been a passenger in another vehicle that was stopped earlier that day.

We merely note that the fact that the testimony at issue was obviously not used for impeachment purposes is one factor suggesting that there was no \u201cuse\u201d of defendant\u2019s <em>post-Miranda </em>silence against him in the present case.</p>\n</footnote>\n<footnote label=\"9\">\n<p id=\"b765-6\"> Accordingly, contrary to the dissent\u2019s indication, we do not suggest that a single comment may never constitute a <em>Doyle </em>violation. <em>Post </em>at 588, n 4. We merely conclude that the single isolated incident at issue in the present case did not constitute a <em>Doyle </em>violation.</p>\n</footnote>\n<footnote label=\"10\">\n<p id=\"b766-10\"> Our decision is also consistent with the holding of the Indiana Supreme Court in <em>Cook, v State, </em>544 NE2d 1359, 1363 (Ind, 1989), that testimony by a federal agent that there was no further contact with the defendant at a certain point because he \u201chad made a request to speak to an attorney\u201d did not constitute a <em>Doyle </em>violation. Similar to the present case, the remark was an \u201cisolated statement,\u201d and there was no specific inquiry or argument from the prosecution regarding the defendant\u2019s post-<em>Miranda </em>silence. <em>Cook, supra. </em>See also <em>Pulley v Commonwealth, </em>31 Va App 600, 605; 525 SE2d 51 (2000) (holding that there was no <em>Doyle </em>violation from a police officer\u2019s nonresponsive comment that the defendant invoked his right to counsel where the prosecution did not exploit the issue); <em>State v Baccam, </em>476 NW2d 884, 886-887 (Iowa App, 1991) (finding no abuse of discretion in the trial court\u2019s denial of a mistrial on the basis of a single comment related to the defendant\u2019s <em>post-Miranda </em>silence where trial court gave curative instruction and the silence was not used against the defendant).</p>\n</footnote>\n<footnote label=\"11\">\n<p id=\"b767-6\"> We note that, in light of our conclusion that no constitutional error occurred, the \u201charmless beyond a reasonable doubt\u201d test used by the Court of Appeals is inapposite. Like the Eleventh Circuit in <em>Stubbs, </em>\u201c[w]e do not reach the issue of harmless error because we conclude that, absent <em>use </em>by the prosecution of the comment on defendant\u2019s postarrest silence, there was no <em>Doyle </em>violation.\u201d <em>Stubbs, supra </em>at 835, n 10 (emphasis in original).</p>\n</footnote>\n<footnote label=\"12\">\n<p id=\"b768-8\"> Indeed, this analysis is consistent with <em>Greer. </em>The <em>Greer </em>Court stated that it had no reason to believe that the jury was incapable of obeying curative instructions and that, far from being \u201cdevastating,\u201d evidence of the defendant\u2019s postarrest silence was at most \u201cinsolubly ambiguous.\u201d <em>Id. </em>at 767, n 8. As a further consideration, Detective Cooper\u2019s testimony did not state that defendant absolutely refused to be interviewed by the police, but rather only that he wanted to speak to an attorney before being questioned. A desire to involve an attorney in a police interview or interrogation could well be understood by a juror as reflecting a concern for being treated fairly and wishing the assistance of a sophisticated advocate to respond to any unfair questioning that might seek to turn the suspect\u2019s words against himself. A typical citizen should understand such concerns and not regard the request for an attorney before questioning as being \u201csuspicious\u201d in the same way that an absolute refusal to speak with the police might be taken. Accordingly, the present opinion does not address a situation in which police testimony makes clear that a defendant has absolutely refused to be interviewed by the police.</p>\n</footnote>\n<footnote label=\"13\">\n<p id=\"b768-9\"> We also note that we are puzzled at that Court\u2019s decision to reverse defendant\u2019s conviction of malicious destruction of police property. From the record, and even from the recitation of facts in the Court of Appeals opinion, there was undisputed evidence that defendant openly kicked out the window of a police car in the presence of police officers. Accordingly, it is evident that any possible error was harmless beyond a reasonable doubt with regard to the malicious destruction charge in light of the overwhelming evidence of guilt regarding that charge.</p>\n</footnote>\n</opinion>\n<opinion data-order=\"8\" data-type=\"opinion\" id=\"x999-2\" type=\"dissent\">\n<author id=\"b769-8\">Kelly, J.</author>\n<p id=\"A0C\"><em>{dissenting). </em>I find that the prosecutor in this case used defendant\u2019s post-Miranda<footnotemark>1</footnotemark> silence against him. He asked a series of questions that compared and contrasted defendant\u2019s refusal to submit to a police interview with the acquiescent responses of <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"584\">*584</page-number>other witnesses in similar circumstances. By doing so, the prosecutor submitted defendant\u2019s <em>post-Miranda </em>silence to the jury as evidence from which it was allowed to draw an inference of guilt, thereby violating due process. Thus, I would affirm the Court of Appeals decision to reverse defendant\u2019s convictions and hold that the trial court\u2019s refusal to grant a mistrial was an abuse of discretion.</p>\n<p id=\"b770-5\">I. <em>DOYLE </em>AND ITS PROGENY</p>\n<p id=\"b770-6\">In finding no due process violation below, the majority takes solace in the fact that the prosecutor did not \u201cuse\u201d defendant\u2019s invocation of <em>Miranda </em>rights to impeach him. I think that this is an overly narrow view of due process protections.</p>\n<p id=\"b770-7\">A defendant\u2019s due process right not to have his <em>post-Miranda </em>silence used against him exists in more situations than where a prosecutor uses the silence to impeach. To be sure, <em>Doyle v Ohio</em><footnotemark><em>2</em></footnotemark><em> </em>held that due process is violated where a prosecutor impeaches a defendant with evidence of his <em>post-Miranda </em>silence. But, the point of <em>Doyle </em>is \u201cthat it is fundamentally unfair to promise an arrested person that his silence will not be used against him and thereafter . . . us[e] the silence to impeach [him]\u201d or otherwise \u201cmake use of the . . . exercise of those rights in obtaining his conviction.\u201d <em>Wainright v Greenfield, </em>474 US 284, 292; 106 S Ct 634; 88 L Ed 2d 623 (1986). \u201cWhat is impermissible is the evidentiary use of . . . his constitutional rights after the . . . assurance\u201d of <em>Miranda. Id. </em>at 295.</p>\n<p id=\"b771-5\"><page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"585\">*585</page-number>I believe that it is also fundamentally unfair, and therefore, a deprivation of due process, for the prosecution to use a defendant\u2019s <em>post-Miranda </em>silence as affirmative proof at trial. This conclusion is consistent with that in several decisions that applied <em>Doyle </em>to references made to a defendant\u2019s <em>post-Miranda </em>silence during the prosecution\u2019s case in chief. See, e.g., <em>United States v Moreno, </em>185 F3d 465, 473 (CA 5, 1999); <em>People of Territory of Guam v Veloria, </em>136 F3d 648, 651-653 (CA 9, 1998); <em>United States v Massuet, </em>851 F2d 111, 114 (CA 4, 1988); <em>United States v Elkins, </em>774 F2d 530, 537 (CA 1, 1985); <em>State v Treesh, </em>90 Ohio St 3d 460, 479; 739 NE2d 749 (2001).</p>\n<p id=\"b771-6\">The issue in this case is whether defendant\u2019s trial was fundamentally unfair. It is whether the prosecutor used defendant\u2019s <em>post-Miranda </em>silence against him so that it was submitted to the jury as evidence from which the jury could infer guilt.</p>\n<p id=\"b771-7\">n. THE PROSECUTION\u2019S \u201cUSE\u201d OF DEFENDANT\u2019S <em>TOS\u00cd-MIRANDA </em>SILENCE</p>\n<p id=\"b771-8\">Although the majority acknowledges that Detective Cooper\u2019s testimony was \u201cinappropriate,\u201d it nevertheless finds that there was no improper \u201cuse\u201d of defendant\u2019s <em>postMiranda </em>silence against him in this case. It cites the \u201climited nature\u201d of the improper testimony and asserts that the prosecutor neither pursued the matter further nor raised the issue during oral argument. I disagree and maintain that the prosecutor did impermissibly use defendant\u2019s <em>post-Miranda </em>silence against him.</p>\n<p id=\"b771-9\">In my view, the majority arrives at an erroneous conclusion in part because it fails to consider Detective Cooper\u2019s testimony in context. With this in mind, <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"586\">*586</page-number>I will provide a brief review of the facts surrounding this case.</p>\n<p id=\"b772-5\">On the afternoon of August 23, 1997, defendant telephoned his grandmother and asked that she send someone to get him in an automobile. She sent her daughter, Nancy Kennebrew, and defendant\u2019s half-sister, Evonne Ezell, in the grandmother\u2019s van.<footnotemark>3</footnotemark> After defendant got into the van, Grand Rapids Police Officers Beckett and Anderson saw it fail to stop at a stop sign. They stopped the van and found that Ezell was driving, Nancy Kennebrew was in the passenger seat, and defendant was in the back seat apparently straddling a safe.</p>\n<p id=\"b772-6\">The officers asked permission to search the occupants. Defendant and Nancy Kennebrew refused, while Ezell agreed. Although no contraband was found on Ezell\u2019s person, the officers detained her, directed Nancy Kennebrew and defendant to wait inside the officers\u2019 cruiser, then searched the van. Inside, they discovered a locked safe, prompting them to call for assistance from a police dog to determine whether there were prohibited substances inside the safe. Meanwhile, while in the police cruiser, defendant kicked out its rear window. A subsequent search of the safe revealed a handgun, cocaine, marijuana, and a large amount of cash.</p>\n<p id=\"b772-7\">At trial, the prosecutor called Grand Rapids Detective Kent Cooper as an expert witness on the subject of controlled substances. After several preliminary questions, the trial court qualified him as an expert. Although one would expect the prosecutor then to <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"587\">*587</page-number>query him regarding his expert opinion on certain matters of evidence, the prosecutor opted not to do so immediately. Instead, he questioned Cooper regarding his investigation of the case and engaged in the following colloquy:</p>\n<blockquote id=\"b773-5\"><em>Q. </em>[The prosecutor]: Detective, you in fact were the assigned detective for the investigation after the arrest of [defendant], is that correct?</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b773-6\"><em>A. </em>[Cooper]: Correct.</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b773-7\"><em>Q. </em>Can you tell the jury how you initially came into contact with this case?</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b773-8\"><em>A. </em>I was assigned to the Vice Unit day team, and on the day team we are assigned the cases from the previous night of arrest or from the weekend prior to the day that we work.</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b773-9\"><em>Q. </em>And this arrest occurred on Saturday afternoon, actually, of the 23rd of August?</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b773-10\"><em>A. </em>Right, and on Monday I received the case.</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b773-11\"><em>Q. What type of investigation follow-up did you do with regard to </em>this?</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b773-12\">\n<em>A. I went out and attempted to interview [defendant], and at that time it was refused. He wished to speak to an attorney prior to me asking him any questions.</em>\n</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b773-13\"><em>Q. Did you speak with the other persons in this particular </em>case?</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b773-14\">\n<em>A. I believe it was the next day that I went to the Ken-nebrew residence and spoke with Nancy Kennebrew, the younger one. I spoke with the grandmother, and I spoke with Evonne Ezell.</em>\n</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b773-15\"><em>Q. And did they give you statements as to their knowledge or lack of knowledge of this </em>incident?</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b773-16\">\n<em>A. Yes.</em>\n</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b773-17\"><em>Q. And then you obtained warrants in this particular </em>matter\u25a0?</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b773-18\"><em>A. Yes. </em>[Emphasis added.]</blockquote>\n<p id=\"b774-4\"><page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"588\">*588</page-number>Cooper\u2019s testimony unequivocally communicated to the jurors that defendant \u201crefused\u201d to submit to police questioning after his arrest and \u201cwished to speak to an attorney\u201d before answering any questions. Whereas the majority labels this as testimony of a \u201climited nature,\u201d it is, in fact, an explicit statement that defendant invoked his <em>Miranda </em>rights. It enabled the jury to infer guilt from defendant\u2019s silence, thereby violating his due process rights.<footnotemark>4</footnotemark></p>\n<p id=\"AM9\">Even if Cooper\u2019s reference to defendant\u2019s post-Miranda silence did not constitute a \u201cuse\u201d of post-Miranda silence by itself, in subsequent questions the prosecutor did use defendant\u2019s <em>post-Miranda </em>silence against him. Immediately after Cooper told the jury of the \u201crefusal\u201d to speak, the prosecutor asked Cooper if he spoke with \u201cthe other persons in this particular case.\u201d Cooper related that he spoke with defendant\u2019s grandmother, as well as Nancy Kennebrew and Evonne Ezell. The prosecutor then asked Cooper whether those witnesses gave statements to him. Cooper replied that they did, and then explained that those witnesses\u2019 statements led to the issuance of arrest warrants.<footnotemark>5</footnotemark></p>\n<p id=\"b775-4\"><page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"589\">*589</page-number>Viewed in context, the prosecutor\u2019s questions and Detective Cooper\u2019s answers demonstrate how the prosecutor compared defendant\u2019s willingness to be interviewed by police with the willingness of the other witnesses directly involved. The prosecutor conveyed that defendant refused to speak, but that others who were in the van when it was stopped, and the van\u2019s owner, agreed to speak to police. Given that the others were initially implicated with the safe, questions regarding the degree of cooperation by defendant and the others in Cooper\u2019s investigation implied that defendant\u2019s silence evidenced guilt.<footnotemark>6</footnotemark></p>\n<p id=\"b775-5\">Everything considered, I believe it reasonable to conclude that the prosecutor\u2019s line of questioning was intended to call attention to defendant\u2019s post-<em>Miranda </em>silence and use it against him. The tactics rendered the trial \u201cfundamentally unfair.\u201d<footnotemark>7</footnotemark></p>\n<p id=\"b776-4\"><page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"590\">*590</page-number>My conclusion is not altered by the cautionary instruction given in the instant case. A curative instruction does not always eradicate a due process violation brought about by the use of a defendant\u2019s <em>post-Miranda </em>silence.<footnotemark>8</footnotemark> The instruction here did not address the prosecutor\u2019s juxtaposition of defendant\u2019s response to Cooper\u2019s request for an interview and the other witnesses\u2019 responses. Thus, notwithstanding the instruction, the effect of the comparison remained unassailed in the juiy\u2019s perception. Therefore, the curative instruction does not preclude a finding that the prosecutor used defendant\u2019s <em>post-Miranda </em>silence against him.<footnotemark>9</footnotemark></p>\n<p id=\"b776-5\">The impermissible use of defendant\u2019s <em>post-Miranda </em>silence in this case makes the majority\u2019s reliance on <em>Greer, </em>supra, inapposite. Here, unlike in <em>Greer, </em>there was a series of <em>questions and answers </em>that focused on defendant\u2019s <em>post-Miranda </em>silence.<footnotemark>10</footnotemark> Thus, there was actual testimony presented here that conveyed to the jury that defendant \u201crefused\u201d to speak to an investigating officer and wanted to speak to an attorney.</p>\n<p id=\"b776-6\">Additionally, the trial court in <em>Greer </em>gave two cautionary instructions; the trial court in the present case <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"591\">*591</page-number>gave merely one. See <em>Greer, supra </em>at 759. The trial court\u2019s instructions in <em>Greer </em>did not specifically mention the earlier impropriety.<footnotemark>11</footnotemark> By contrast, here the trial court\u2019s instruction expressly cited Cooper\u2019s improper testimony, highlighting the earlier testimonial error and reminding the jury of defendant\u2019s refusal to submit to a police interview.</p>\n<p id=\"b777-5\">Finally, unlike in <em>Greer, </em>the record here supports the conclusion that there was an improper use of defendant\u2019s <em>post-Miranda </em>silence against him. Here, the prosecutor highlighted for the jury the fact that defendant chose not to speak to an investigating officer, whereas other persons, possibly associated with the safe, did speak. Because there was a far greater burdening of defendant\u2019s rights in the instant case than in <em>Greer, </em>I believe that the majority errs in finding <em>Greer </em>analogous. See <em>Moreno, supra </em>at 474, limiting <em>Greer </em>to cases wher\u00e9 no answer is given to an improper question; <em>Newman, supra </em>at 1157-1158.</p>\n<p id=\"b777-6\">I would find the prosecutor\u2019s use of defendant\u2019s <em>post-Miranda </em>silence violative of due process and the trial court\u2019s refusal to grant a mistrial an abuse of its discretion.<footnotemark>12</footnotemark></p>\n<p id=\"ArC\"><page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"592\">*592</page-number>in. CONCLUSION</p>\n<p id=\"b778-5\">The prosecutor used defendant\u2019s <em>post-Miranda </em>silence against him by calling the jury\u2019s attention to it and by inferring defendant\u2019s guilt from it. This rendered defendant\u2019s trial \u201cfundamentally unfair\u201d and violated defendant\u2019s due process rights. Thus, I would affirm the Court of Appeals decision to reverse defendant\u2019s convictions.</p>\n<judges id=\"b778-6\">Cavanagh, J., concurred with Kelly, J.</judges>\n<footnote label=\"1\">\n<p id=\"b769-9\"> <em>Miranda v Arizona, </em>384 US 436; 86 S Ct 1602; 16 L Ed 2d 694 (1966).</p>\n</footnote>\n<footnote label=\"2\">\n<p id=\"b770-8\"> 426 US 610, 618; 96 S Ct 2240; 49 L Ed 2d 91 (1976).</p>\n</footnote>\n<footnote label=\"3\">\n<p id=\"b772-8\"> Defendant\u2019s grandmother and her daughter are both named \u201cNancy Kennebrew.\u201d To help avoid confusion, I will refer to the elder Kennebrew as \u201cthe grandmother,\u201d and the junior Kennebrew as \u201cNancy Kennebrew.\u201d</p>\n</footnote>\n<footnote label=\"4\">\n<p id=\"Ar1d\"> Contrary to the majority\u2019s inherent suggestion, a single improper comment about a defendant\u2019s <em>post-Miranda </em>silence may rise to the level of a due process violation.
