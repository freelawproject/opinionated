Having granted leave to appeal and heard oral,argument, this Court finds as follows:</p>\n<p id=\"b551-12\">(1) The power of referendum of the Michigan Constitution \u201cdoes not extend to acts making appropriations for state institutions . . . .\u201d Const 1963, art 2, \u00a7 9.</p>\n<p id=\"b552-4\"><page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"366\">*366</page-number>(2) 2000 PA 381 states that \u201cone million dollars is appropriated from the general fund to the department of state police . . .

I write to emphasize that the intervening defendant retains a direct remedy, the ini<page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"367\">*367</page-number>tiative process. Under our state constitution, this remedy is available even when the Legislature has made an appropriation to a state institution.</p>\n<p id=\"b553-5\">I also wish to emphasize that the Legislature\u2019s subjective motivation for making a $1,000,000 appropriation in 2000 PA 381 \u2014 assuming one can be accurately identified<footnotemark>1</footnotemark> \u2014 is irrelevant. Intervening defendant contends that despite the appropriation in 2000 PA 381 and the plain language of Const 1963, art 2, \u00a7 9, the act is subject to the referendum process because the \u201cpurpose\u201d of the appropriation, as purportedly revealed by the legislative history, was to evade a referendum. This argument is misplaced. This Court has repeatedly held that courts must not be concerned with the alleged motives of a legislative body in enacting a law, but only with the end result \u2014 the actual language of the legislation. See <em>Kuhn v Dep\u2019t of Treasury, </em>384 Mich 378, 383-384; 183 NW2d 796 (1971); <em>C F Smith Co v Fitzgerald, </em>270 Mich 659, 681; 259 NW 352 (1935); <em>People v Gibbs, </em>186 Mich 127, 134-135; 152 NW 1053 (1915).</p>\n<p id=\"b553-6\">Our cases follow Justice Cooley\u2019s powerful exposition of this doctrine in his seminal work on constitutional law. It is as persuasive to us as it was to our predecessors:</p>\n<blockquote id=\"b553-7\">The validity of legislation can never be made to depend on the motives which have secured its adoption, whether <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"368\">*368</page-number>these be public or personal, honest or corrupt. There is ample reason for this in the fact that the people have set no authority over the legislators with jurisdiction to inquire into their conduct, and to judge what have been their purposes in the pretended discharge of the legislative trust. This is a jurisdiction which they have reserved to themselves exclusively, and they have appointed frequent elections as the occasions and the means for bringing these agents to account. A further reason is, that to make legislation depend upon motives would render all statute law uncertain, and the rule which should allow it could not logically stop short of permitting a similar inquiry into the motives of those who passed judgment. Therefore the courts do not permit a question of improper legislative motives to be raised, but they will in every instance assume that the motives were public and befitting the station. They will also assume that the legislature had before it any evidence necessary to enable it to take the action it did take. [Cooley, Constitutional Law, pp 154-155.]</blockquote>\n<footnote label=\"1\">\n<p id=\"b553-8\"> The parties and amicus curiae have asserted contradictory positions regarding the legislative motive for the appropriation in 2000 PA 381. It is a dubious proposition to suggest that a legislative body comprised of individual persons can have a single motivation for enacting any piece of legislation. Even assuming that such a motive could be ascertained, there is no testimonial record in this original action. Accordingly, we have no means by which to decide these disputed claims regarding legislative motivation.</p>\n</footnote>\n</opinion>\n<opinion data-order=\"14\" data-type=\"opinion\" id=\"x999-3\" type=\"concurrence\">\n<author id=\"b554-6\">Young, J.</author>\n<p id=\"AgA\">I join and fully concur in the admirably concise majority opinion. I write separately to provide the rationale and analysis for my conclusion that 2000 PA 381 is exempt from the referendum power of art 2, \u00a7 9 of our 1963 state constitution and why I take exception to the constitutional exegesis offered by my dissenting colleagues.</p>\n<p id=\"b554-7\">I. THE QUESTION BEFORE THE COURT</p>\n<p id=\"b554-8\">There is no gainsaying that 2000 PA 381 has become the focus of a heated debate among various segments of Michigan\u2019s citizens; Justice Cavanagh\u2019s dissent is generous in providing his own extensive personal views on the public controversy surrounding 2000 PA 381. However important, this political issue\u2014 the merits or demerits of the underlying act \u2014 is <em>not </em><page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"369\">*369</page-number>before this Court. The sole question we are to decide in this case is a legal one: Is 2000 PA 381 subject to the referral process under the provisions of art 2, \u00a7 9? If it is, 2000 PA 381 will not become effective until the next general election \u2014 if a majority of the voters then approve it. Const 1963, art 2, \u00a7 9; MCL 168.477(2). If the stated limitation on the people\u2019s referral power contained in art 2, \u00a7 9 applies, the act is not subject to the referendum process at all.</p>\n<p id=\"b555-5\">n. FACTUAL AND PROCEDURAL BACKGROUND</p>\n<p id=\"b555-6\">In December 2000, the Legislature enacted 2000 PA 381, MCL 28.421 <em>et seq., </em>which modifies the standards for the issuance of concealed weapons permits. The effective date of the law is July 1, 2001.</p>\n<p id=\"b555-7\">Intervening defendant is a group that filed with defendants Secretary of State and Board of State Canvassers a petition, signed by approximately 260,000 Michigan voters,<footnotemark>1</footnotemark> requesting a referendum on the new law. Although the Board of Canvassers initially, by a two-to-two vote, declined to certify the petition on the basis that the law may not be subject to referendum, on May 21, 2001, the board certified the petition. Approximately 230,000 valid signatures sup<page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"370\">*370</page-number>ported the petition (80,000 more than the number required).<footnotemark>2</footnotemark></p>\n<p id=\"b556-5\">On March 23, 2001, plaintiffs \u2014 two organizations that lobbied for the law and three individuals who want to apply for concealed weapons permits \u2014 filed a complaint for mandamus in the Court of Appeals, seeking to prevent the Board of State Canvassers from proceeding with the canvass of the petitions. Plaintiffs argued that 2000 PA 381 is not subject to referendum because it contains an appropriation to a state institution, the Department of State Police, and the Michigan Constitution provides that \u201c[t]he power of referendum does not extend to acts making appropriations for state institutions . . . .\u201d Const 1963, art 2, \u00a79.</p>\n<p id=\"b556-6\">As stated, plaintiffs contended that two provisions in 2000 PA 381 make appropriations for a state institution within the meaning of art 9, \u00a7 2. The first, \u00a7 5v of the act, (1) creates a concealed weapon enforcement fund in the state treasury, (2) allows the state treasurer to receive money or other assets from any source for deposit into the fund and to direct the investment of the fund, (3) provides that money in the fund at the close of the fiscal year shall remain in the fund and not lapse to the general fund, and (4) directs the Department of State Police to expend money from the enforcement fund only to provide training to law enforcement personnel in connection <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"371\">*371</page-number>with the act.<footnotemark>3</footnotemark> The second, \u00a7 5w(l) of the act, provides that \u201c[o]ne million dollars is appropriated from the general fund to the department of state police for the fiscal year ending September 30, 2001\u201d for such activities as distributing free safety devices to the public and creating and maintaining a database of individuals applying for a concealed weapons license.<footnotemark>4</footnotemark></p>\n<p id=\"b557-5\">Plaintiffs further argued that defendants Secretary of State and the Board of Canvassers had a threshold duty to determine whether the petition on its face meets the constitutional prerequisites for acceptance and canvassing, and that, until this determination was made, canvassing should cease.</p>\n<p id=\"b558-3\"><page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"372\">*372</page-number>In an order dated April 9, 2001, the Court of Appeals granted People Who Care About Kids permission to intervene and accepted the amicus curiae brief of the Michigan Association of Chiefs of Police. The panel then dismissed plaintiffs\u2019 complaint for mandamus, holding \u2014 on a ground not raised by the parties \u2014 that</p>\n<blockquote id=\"b558-4\">the matter is not ripe for this Court\u2019s consideration. The Board of State Canvassers has not completed its canvass of the referendum petitions. MCL 168.479.[<footnotemark>5</footnotemark>]</blockquote>\n<p id=\"b558-7\">On plaintiffs\u2019 application for leave to appeal, this Court remanded the matter to the Court of Appeals for plenary consideration of the complaint for mandamus.<footnotemark>6</footnotemark> 463 Mich 1009 (2001).</p>\n<p id=\"b558-8\">On remand, the Court of Appeals denied plaintiffs\u2019 request for mandamus, holding that \u201c2000 PA 381 is not an act making appropriations for state institutions as contemplated by Const 1963, art 2, \u00a7 9,\u201d and that it therefore was subject to referendum. 246 Mich App 82; 630 NW2d 376 (2001).</p>\n<p id=\"b559-4\"><page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"373\">*373</page-number>We granted plaintiffs\u2019 application for leave to appeal from the decision of the Court of Appeals. 464 Mich 855 (2001).<footnotemark>7</footnotemark></p>\n<p id=\"b559-5\">in. controlling rules of constitutional construction</p>\n<p id=\"b559-6\">Of preeminent importance in addressing the matter at hand is an understanding of the particularized rules of textual construction that apply to constitutional provisions. \u201cEach provision of a State Constitution is the direct word of the people of the State, not that of the scriveners thereof,\u201d <em>Lockwood v Nims, </em>357 Mich 517, 565; 98 NW2d 753 (1959) (Black, J., concurring), and therefore \u201c[w]e must never forget that it is a Constitution we are expounding,\u201d <em>id., </em>quoting <em>McCulloch v Maryland, </em>17 US (4 Wheat) 316, 407; 4 L Ed 579 (1819).</p>\n<p id=\"b559-7\">Our primary goal in construing a constitutional provision \u2014 in marked contrast to a statute or other texts \u2014 is to give effect to the <em>intent of the people </em>of the state of Michigan who ratified the constitution, by applying the rule of \u201ccommon understanding.\u201d Recently, in <em>People v Bulger, </em>462 Mich 495, 507; 614 NW2d 103 (2000), we explained the rule of common understanding:</p>\n<blockquote id=\"b559-8\">In construing our constitution, this Court\u2019s object is to give effect to the intent of the people adopting it. . . . \u201cHence, the primary source for ascertaining its meaning is <em>to examine its plain meaning as understood by its ratifiers </em>at the time of its adoption.\u201d [Citations omitted; emphasis supplied.]</blockquote>\n<p id=\"b560-4\"><page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"374\">*374</page-number>I agree with Justice Cavanagh\u2019s reliance on Justice Cooley\u2019s explanation of the rule of \u201ccommon understanding\u201d:</p>\n<blockquote id=\"b560-5\">A constitution is made for the people and by the people. <em>The interpretation that should be given it is that which reasonable minds, the great mass of the people themselves, would give it. </em>\u201cFor as the Constitution does not derive its force from the convention which framed, but from the people who ratified it, <em>the intent to be arrived at is that of the people, </em>and it is not to be supposed that they have looked for any dark or abstruse meaning in the words employed, <em>but rather that they have accepted them in the sense most obvious to the common understanding, </em>and ratified the instrument in the belief that that was the sense designed to be conveyed.\u201d <em>[Federated Publications, Inc v Michigan State Univ Bd of Trustees, </em>460 Mich 75, 85; 594 NW2d 491 (1999), quoting 1 Cooley, Constitutional Limitations (6th ed), p 81 (emphasis added).]</blockquote>\n<p id=\"b560-6\">See also <em>American Axle &amp; Mfg, Inc v Hamtramck, </em>461 Mich 352, 362; 604 NW2d 330 (2000); <em>State Highway Comm v Vanderkloot, </em>392 Mich 159, 179; 220 NW2d 416 (1974); <em>Traverse City Sch Dist v Attorney General, </em>384 Mich 390, 405; 185 NW2d 9 (1971); <em>Michigan Farm Bureau v. Secretary of State, </em>379 Mich 387, 391; 151 NW2d 797 (1967); <em>Lockwood, supra </em>at 569.</p>\n<p id=\"b560-7\">As expounded by Justice Cooley and this Court, the \u201ccommon understanding\u201d principle of construction is essentially a search for the original meaning attributed to the words of the constitution by those who ratified it. This rule of construction acknowledges the possibility that a provision of the constitution may rationally bear multiple meanings, but the rule is concerned with ascertaining and giving effect only to the construction, consistent with the language, that the <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"375\">*375</page-number>ratifiers intended. Thus, our task is not to impose on the constitutional text at issue here the meaning we as judges would prefer, or even the meaning the people of Michigan today would prefer, but to search for contextual clues about what meaning the people who ratified the text <em>in 1963 </em>gave to it.</p>\n<p id=\"b561-5\">Our analysis, of course, must begin with an examination of the precise language used in art 2, \u00a7 9 of our 1963 Constitution. See <em>American Axle, supra </em>at 362. Art 2, \u00a7 9 provides, in relevant part:</p>\n<blockquote id=\"b561-6\">The people reserve to themselves the power to propose laws and to enact and reject laws, called the initiative, and the power to approve or reject laws enacted by the legislature, called the referendum. The power of initiative extends only to laws which the legislature may enact under this constitution. <em>The power of referendum does not extend to acts making appropriations for state institutions or to meet deficiencies in state funds </em>and must be invoked in the manner prescribed by law within 90 days following the final adjournment of the legislative session at which the law was enacted. To invoke the initiative or referendum, petitions signed by a number of registered electors, not less than eight percent for initiative and five percent for referendum of the total vote cast for all candidates for governor at the last preceding general election at which a governor was elected shall be required.</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b561-7\">No law as to which the power of referendum properly has been invoked shall be effective thereafter unless approved by a majority of the electors voting thereon at the next general election. [Emphasis supplied.]</blockquote>\n<p id=\"b561-8\">As is apparent from the text of art 2, \u00a7 9, the people\u2019s right of referral is expressly limited. The limitation relevant here is the first: There is no right of referral for \u201cacts making appropriations for state institutions.\u201d There is no dispute here that the Department of State Police is a \u201cstate institution\u201d within the <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"376\">*376</page-number>meaning of art 2, \u00a7 9. Nor is there any dispute that 2000 PA 381 \u201callocated\u201d one million dollars of public funds to the state police for responsibilities that the act requires the state police to perform. The contested issue is whether the million-dollar allocation made in 2000 PA 381 constitutes an \u201cappropriation\u201d within the meaning of art 2, \u00a7 9.</p>\n<p id=\"b562-5\">IV. APPLICATION</p>\n<p id=\"b562-6\">A. WAS THE COMMON UNDERSTANDING OF THE ARTICLE 2, SECTION 9 LIMITATION ON THE RIGHT OF REFERRAL AT THE TIME OF RATIFICATION DIFFERENT FROM THE PLAIN MEANING OF THE LANGUAGE?</p>\n<p id=\"b562-7\">The majority construes the language of art 2, \u00a7 9 in a plain and natural manner. Thus, it concludes that 2000 PA 381 is an act making an appropriation to a state institution and is thus exempt from the referral power. To read the hmiting language of art 2, \u00a7 9 in any other manner would incorporate into that constitutional provision a meaning that is not apparent on its face. Accordingly, unless we are able to determine that this provision had some other particularized meaning in the collective mind of the 1963 electorate, we must give the effect to the natural meaning of the language used in the constitution.</p>\n<p id=\"b562-8\">Justice Cavanagh asserts that the common understanding of art 2, \u00a7 9 is different from the plain meaning given to this constitutional provision by the majority. Those who suggest that the meaning to be given a provision of our constitution varies from a natural reading of the constitutional text bear the burden of providing the evidence that the ratifiers subscribed to such an alternative construction. Otherwise, the constitution becomes no more than a <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"377\">*377</page-number>Rorschach<footnotemark>8</footnotemark> exercise in which judges project and impose their personal views of what the constitution <em>should have said.</em><footnotemark><em>9</em></footnotemark></p>\n<p id=\"b563-5\">Interestingly, no one \u2014 not the dissents, the parties, or even the amici curiae \u2014 has attempted to provide a scintilla of historically based evidence that provides support for the belief that in 1963 the people of this state understood the limiting language of art 2, \u00a7 9 to mean something other than what it naturally and plainly says. The reason for this omission is simple: There is not much historical background on the provision to report in the first instance. Moreover, that which exists fails to demonstrate that the people attributed a meaning other than the construction the majority gives to art 2, \u00a7 9.</p>\n<p id=\"b563-6\">Within the limited time constraints occasioned by the exigencies of having to decide this case by the July 1, 2001, effective date of 2000 PA 381, we have searched for evidence that the common understanding is that proposed by Justice Cavanagh. We have found no such historical evidence in the record of the constitutional convention, at the time of our constitu<page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"378\">*378</page-number>tion\u2019s ratification, or in contemporaneous news articles that provide support for the dissent\u2019s asserted \u201cspecial\u201d common understanding of art 2, \u00a7 9.</p>\n<p id=\"b564-5\">Indeed, one might expect that the framers of our 1963 Constitution \u2014 the participants of the constitutional convention that drafted the constitutional text that was eventually ratified \u2014 would have provided some gloss on or construction of the intended meaning of the art 2, \u00a7 9 limitation on the right of referral. In point of fact, the framers provided none.</p>\n<p id=\"b564-6\">Surprisingly, during the entire constitutional convention, excepting references to the convention\u2019s successive procedural approvals of the provision at issue, the framers never discussed the substance of art 2, \u00a7 9.<footnotemark>10</footnotemark> Especially important, nothing in the convention record has any bearing on what the framers, much less the public, \u201ccommonly understood\u201d about the limitation on the referral power created by the constitutional language selected \u2014 \u201cacts making appropriations for state institutions.\u201d</p>\n<p id=\"b564-7\">Particularly noteworthy in this regard is the \u201cAddress to the People\u201d accompanying Const 1963, art 2, \u00a7 9. The address, officially approved by the members of the constitutional cdnvention, provides the text of each provision of the proposed constitution the people ratified in 1963 and a commentary, written in simple language, explaining the import of each provision and any changes the proposed constitution made to comparable provisions of the 1908 Constitution. That address was widely distributed to <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"379\">*379</page-number>the public before the ratification vote.<footnotemark>11</footnotemark> The address was intended as a vehicle to educate the public about the proposed constitution.</p>\n<p id=\"b565-5\">Significantly, in the \u201cAddress to the People\u201d accompanying Const 1963, art 2, \u00a7 9, the framers advise the people that this provision constitutes only a \u201crevision\u201d of Const 1908, art 5, \u00a7 1, and that the revision \u201celiminatfes] much language of a purely statutory character.\u201d 2 Official Record, p 3367. The address also notes that the revision \u201cspecifically reserves the initiative and referendum powers to the people [and] <em>limits them </em>as noted . . . .\u201d<footnotemark>12</footnotemark> <em>Id. </em>(emphasis added). There is no further reference to the art 2, \u00a7 9 \u201climits\u201d on the power of referral or any explanation regarding how those limitations were expected to function in practice.</p>\n<p id=\"b565-6\">Thus, the 1963 constitutional record provides no basis for concluding that the people were led to believe (or actually entertained the notion) that the art 2, \u00a7 9 limitation on the right of referral \u2014 \u201cacts making appropriations for state institutions\u201d \u2014 meant or was intended to mean anything other than what it <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"380\">*380</page-number>plainly says. Similarly, I have been unable to locate (and no one has provided to the Court) any contemporaneous news articles or other documents circulated in the public domain that suggest that the public in 1963 had a specific or \u201ccommon\u201d understanding of art 2, \u00a7 9 that diverged from the natural and plain meaning of its text.<footnotemark>13</footnotemark></p>\n<p id=\"b566-6\">The absence of any evidence from the 1963 constitutional convention record or other contemporaneous articles in the public domain suggesting support for some kind of special \u201ccommon understanding\u201d about art 2, \u00a7 9 consistent with the dissents\u2019 view (or any other) ought to be conclusive.

He is able to so conclude because he is convinced that the natural construction the majority gives to art 2, \u00a7 9 produces an \u201cabsurd result\u201d:<footnotemark>14</footnotemark></p>\n<blockquote id=\"A9K\">I am confident that the constitutional right of referendum, in this narrow context, should not be taken away by so transparent an artifice. Justice Cooley\u2019s \u201cgreat mass of the people\u201d would, if asked, surely suppose that \u201cacts making appropriations for state institutions,\u201d which deny the people\u2019s reserved power of referendum, are general appropriations bills containing substantial grants to state agencies. Those grants would have to ensure the viability of the agencies or, as the Court of Appeals put it, support the agencies\u2019 \u201ccore functions.\u201d 246 Mich App 82; 630 NW2d 376 (2001). The people of Michigan, I am certain, never intended to authorize the 2000 lame duck Legislature\u2019s legerdemain. <em>[Post </em>at 411.][<footnotemark>15</footnotemark>]</blockquote>\n<p id=\"b567-6\">I believe that Justice Cavanagh\u2019s presumption is unfounded because (1) it is not grounded in an assessment of what the voters <em>in 1963 </em>understood art 2, \u00a7 9 to mean, and (2) it does not give sufficient weight or meaning to the expressly stated competing language and values embodied in our constitution or the differences between the power of initiative and referral.</p>\n<p id=\"b568-4\"><page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"382\">*382</page-number>In this regard, it is important to consider the relationship between the constitutional power accorded to the Legislature, Const 1963, art 4, \u00a7 1, and the specific means chosen in the initiative and referendum provisions that check the power of the Legislature.<footnotemark>16</footnotemark> Without question, art 4, \u00a7 1 gives the Legislature plenary power to enact laws for the benefit of Michigan citizens. Equally clearly, art 2, \u00a7 9 provides a means for citizens directly to challenge legislative action or inaction. I believe that it is a matter of constitutional significance that the <em>initiative </em>power contains no limitation (save procedural requirements such as those concerning when the initiative process can be commenced and the number of people who must support it), but that the <em>referendum </em>power is expressly limited by two substantive restrictions \u2014 an exception to the power of referral for acts \u201cmaking appropriations for state institutions,\u201d and an exception for those acts enacted to \u201cmeet deficiencies in state funds.\u201d<footnotemark>17</footnotemark></p>\n<p id=\"b568-5\">Stated otherwise (leaving aside momentarily the question of what the people understood in 1963 the art 2, \u00a7 9 term \u201cappropriations\u201d meant), it appears unchallenged that \u201cacts making appropriations\u201d are <em>always </em>subject to nullification by initiative, but such acts are <em>exempted </em>from the referral power. Because <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"383\">*383</page-number>exercise of both the referral and initiative powers may result in the nullification of a law enacted by the Legislature, one may well ask: Why, when the people enacted two provisions that are clearly intended as checks on the constitutional power of the Legislature, would the people substantially limit their power of referral, but not their power of initiative? Based upon the structure of these provisions, the answer appears obvious that the people feared more the circumstance of preventing acts involving \u201cappropriations\u201d from becoming law (the referral power) than they feared a nullification vote on the very same bill <em>after </em>it became effective. Otherwise they would not have imposed an exception to their power of referral.</p>\n<p id=\"b569-5\">Justice Cavanagh asserts that the \u201cappropriations\u201d limitation on the people\u2019s referral power could only have been intended to mean \u201cgeneral appropriations bills containing substantial grants to state agencies.\u201d <em>Post </em>at 411. I question why that conclusion is justified, particularly given that even the dissent notes the framers\u2019 drafting precision concerning matters involving the <em>general budget. </em>See <em>post </em>at 409-410. I wholeheartedly agree with Justice Cavanagh that the framers intended to improve and increase legislative accountability for legislative <em>general budgeting </em>processes and were very precise in their draftsmanship to accomplish this goal. See, e.g., Const 1963, art 4, \u00a7 31 (general appropriation bills, priority, statement of estimated revenue).<footnotemark>18</footnotemark> Justice Cavanagh assumes, <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"384\">*384</page-number>without providing support, that the people believed that only general appropriation acts were referenced in art 2, \u00a7 9.</p>\n<blockquote id=\"b570-12\">appropriations- for the current fiscal year\u2019s operation. Any bill requiring an appropriation to carry out its purpose shall be considered an appropriation bill. One of the general appropriation bills as passed by the legislature shall contain an itemized statement of estimated revenue by major source in each operating fund for the ensuing fiscal period, the total of which shall not be less than the total of all appropriations made from each fund in the general appropriation bills as passed.</blockquote>\n<p id=\"b570-5\">Concerning art 4, \u00a7 31, in the Address to the People the framers advised:</p>\n<blockquote id=\"b570-6\">This is a new section designed to accomplish two major purposes:</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b570-7\">1. To focus legislative attention on the general appropriation bill or bills to the exclusion of any other appropriation bills, except those supplementing appropriations for the current year\u2019s operation.</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b570-8\">2. To require the legislature (as well as the governor by a subsequent provision) to set forth by major item its own best estimates of revenue.</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b570-9\">The legislature frequently differs from executive estimates of revenue. It is proper to require that such differences as exist be specifically set forth for public understanding and future judgment as to the validity of each. [2 Official Record, p 3375.]</blockquote>\n<p id=\"b570-11\">Thus, the people were specifically advised in 1963 that the focus of this provision was to ensure accountability for the making of the entire state budget. A reciprocal provision applicable to the Governor, art 5, \u00a7 18,<footnotemark>19</footnotemark> was also added in 1963. These <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"385\">*385</page-number>were entirely new provisions added to the 1963 Constitution whereas the language of art 2, \u00a7 9 was carried forward from the 1913 amendment to the 1908 Constitution. The 1908 Constitution had no provisions comparable to art 4, \u00a7 31 and art 5, \u00a7 18.</p>\n<p id=\"b571-5\">The point is that, contrary to Justice Cavanagh\u2019s suggestion, none of these <em>general budget </em>provisions added in 1963 were connected by the framers to the older language of art 2, \u00a7 9. More important for our prnpose of discerning whether there was a \u201cspecial\u201d common understanding of art 2, \u00a7 9 as the dissent supposes, it is noteworthy that <em>the framers clearly never communicated to the people </em>that the new general budget provisions had any bearing on other legislative acts, such as 2000 PA 381, that merely made an appropriation of public funds to a state institution. In short, the general budget provisions of the 1963 Constitution do not appear to be related to other kinds of bills that simply \u201cappropriate\u201d for purposes other than the general budget process.<footnotemark>20</footnotemark></p>\n<p id=\"b572-4\"><page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"386\">*386</page-number>Most important to my conclusion that Justice Cavanagh is simply wrong in supposing that art 2, \u00a7 9 refers to <em>general appropriation bills </em>is the fact that art 4, \u00a7 31 provides a definition of \u201cappropriation bill,\u201d<footnotemark>21</footnotemark> and only this category of bills is tied to the annual budget process. Thus, had the framers intended that the art 2, \u00a7 9 \u201cappropriations\u201d limitation on the right of referral mean \u201ca general appropriations bill\u201d as urged by the dissent, then I believe that the framers would have done two things that they clearly did not do. First, I think the framers would have used in art 2, \u00a7 9 the art 4, \u00a7 31 definition of \u201cappropriation bill.\u201d Second, I believe the framers would have advised the public in the Address to the People of the relationship between the newly added general budget provisions (including the definition of appropriation bill) and the older language of art 2, \u00a7 9 limiting the power of referendum.</p>\n<p id=\"b572-5\">When it is so apparent throughout the 1963 Constitution that the framers sought to clarify the budget-related appropriations process, I think that the above-noted omissions underscore that the kind of \u201cappropriations\u201d referenced in art 2, \u00a7 9 have nothing to do with those referenced in art 4. Further, there is no evidence of which we are aware that in 1963 the people had a contrary \u201ccommon understanding.\u201d</p>\n<p id=\"b572-6\">Moreover, greater assurance that there was no \u201ccommon understanding\u201d contrary to the plain language of art 2, \u00a7 9 is derived from the controversy that culminated in this Court\u2019s split decision in <em>Todd v Hull, </em>288 Mich 521; 285 NW 46 (1939). In <em>Todd, </em>this <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"387\">*387</page-number>Court was called upon to determine whether 1939 PA 3<footnotemark>22</footnotemark> was properly given immediate effect pursuant to Const 1908, art 5, \u00a7 21,<footnotemark>23</footnotemark> notwithstanding that, by giving the act immediate effect, the Legislature had encroached upon Const 1908, art 5, \u00a7 1 (the precursor of Const 1963, art 2, \u00a7 9). Four members of the <em>Todd </em>Court agreed, with little explanation, with the plaintiffs\u2019 assertion that 1939 PA 3 was not in the category of \u201cacts making appropriations\u201d within the meaning of art 5, \u00a7 21. However, four other justices observed that</p>\n<blockquote id=\"b573-3\">[t]here is no question but that the act makes an appropriation. An act making an appropriation as used in the Constitution is a legislative act which sets apart or assigns to a particular purpose or use a sum of money out of what may <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"388\">*388</page-number>be in the treasury of the State for a specific purpose and objects, \u2014 an act authorizing the expenditure of public funds for a public purpose. <em>[Todd </em>at 531.]</blockquote>\n<p id=\"b574-5\">Regarding the referral question, these four justices additionally opined that</p>\n<blockquote id=\"b574-6\">[t]he claim that plaintiffs are entitled to a referendum is effectually disposed of by the language of the Constitution itself because if the legislature had a right to give the act in question immediate effect, then it negatived the idea of a referendum. <em>[Todd, supra </em>at 535.]</blockquote>\n<p id=\"b574-7\">The significance of <em>Todd </em>is not that it conclusively construed the same language at issue in this case. The fact is, <em>Todd </em>\u2014 a split decision \u2014 has no preceden-tial value. <em>Todd </em>is nevertheless highly relevant because it involves a claim, similar to the one made here, that the Legislature\u2019s inclusion of an appropriation in 1939 PA 3 was a \u201cmere subterfuge,\u201d <em>Todd </em>at 531, to place it within the category of acts that could be given immediate effect and thus be immune to referendum.</p>\n<p id=\"b574-8\"><em>Todd </em>demonstrates that the people were aware in 1963 that the Legislature had exercised what it believed to be its appropriation prerogative in such a fashion as to diminish the people\u2019s right of referral. Notwithstanding, the people did not seek to change the constitutional referral language to preclude the Legislature from capriciously exercising its po wer of appropriation.</p>\n<p id=\"b574-9\">V. CONCLUSION</p>\n<p id=\"b574-10\">Determining the people\u2019s \u201ccommon understanding\u201d of a relatively obscure constitutional provision rati-<page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"389\">*389</page-number>fled nearly forty years ago is admittedly a challenging deductive enterprise \u2014 one that must be grounded in the available evidence. Above all, it is not a psychic exercise. On the basis of the evidence we have independently sought, I conclude that there is no reliable evidence that the people commonly understood anything other than what art 2, \u00a7 9 plainly says: that the people\u2019s power of referral is precluded concerning any act that makes an appropriation for a state institution. Accordingly, 2000 PA 381 falls within the category of \u201cacts making appropriations for state institutions\u201d and is thus not amenable to the people\u2019s right of referral under art 2, \u00a7 9.</p>\n<p id=\"b575-5\">The majority\u2019s decision today will undoubtedly disappoint those who passionately believe that 2000 PA 381 represents bad public policy. While it will be of no consolation, it bears restating that the serious underlying political question is <em>not </em>before the Court.</p>\n<p id=\"b575-6\">In the current charged political environment, the dissent makes an emotionally appealing argument: Why not just let the people decide? Simply answered, the people\u2019s ability to decide by the referendum process is not infinite; rather, it is circumscribed by the limitations placed in the Michigan Constitution. While perhaps less satisfying to those who oppose 2000 PA 381, our answer is that the people are still free to directly challenge the propriety of the legislation by initiative. Const 1963, art 2, \u00a7 9; MCL 168.471, 168.472. Additionally, if the people believe that the Legislature has abused its powers by capriciously precluding their power of referral, the traditional means of voter sanction remain recall and the ballot box. However, the limitations imposed in art 2, \u00a7 9 on the people\u2019s <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"390\">*390</page-number>right of referral preclude that they do so by means of referendum.</p>\n<p id=\"b576-5\">Finally, while it may be attractive to some, I believe that the dissenter\u2019s approach is not only at odds with the constitution, but destroys the Legislature\u2019s direct accountability to the people for its acts by interposing the judiciary as an arbiter of essentially political questions that are fundamentally legislative in character. Consider Justice Cavanagh\u2019s tests of what he believes constitutes \u201cappropriations\u201d that do preclude referrals under art 2, \u00a7 9: (1) grants that \u201censure the viability of [state] agencies\u201d; or (2) grants that \u201csupport the agencies\u2019 \u2018core functions.\u2019 \u201d <em>(Post </em>at 411.) Exactly how large an \u201cappropriation\u201d constitutes one sufficient to ensure the \u201cviability\u201d of a state agency or, for that matter, its \u201ccore function\u201d? What <em>is </em>a state agency\u2019s \u201ccore\u201d function, what constitutes its \u201cviability,\u201d and who gets to decide these questions \u2014 the Board of Canvassers, the Secretary of State, the courts? The dissenters are eager to have the courts decide these questions. Perhaps there are members of the public who believe that the courts are competent to address these issues. I submit that these are Delphic questions that neither a judge nor the judicial system itself is best equipped to answer. More to the point, the tests the dissenters urge to assess whether an act making an appropriation is nonetheless amenable to referral <em>despite </em>the express constitutional limitation are simply ones made up from whole cloth and which have no basis in the text of our constitution. The judiciary is not authorized to create ways of evading the terms of our constitution; nor should the courts manufacture tests that amount to no more than providing a means of promoting sitting judges\u2019 personal prefer-<page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"391\">*391</page-number>enees to accomplish such goals. Neither is a judicial function, and the public should never be confused on this issue. Our courts must refrain from engaging in such endeavors because they are beyond our constitutional authority and competence.</p>\n<footnote label=\"1\">\n<p id=\"b555-8\"> According to a letter written by Christopher Thomas, Director of Elections for the Department of State, an effective referendum petition requires 151,136 valid signatures (comprising five percent of voters in the last gubernatorial election).

The issue before this Court is whether it will act as a court of law and read the constitution in accord with its plain language, or whether it will effect what many, perhaps even most, in this state view as a \u201cgood\u201d thing. The majority opinion, in which I fully join, sets forth its analysis simply and straightforwardly. It does so because the constitutional issue before us is simple and straightforward. I offer this concurrence only to emphasize the extremely important points of disagreement between the majority opinion, and the opinions of the Court of Appeals and my dissenting colleagues.</p>\n<p id=\"b577-6\">I. COURT OF APPEALS</p>\n<p id=\"b577-7\">Concerning the opinion of the Court of Appeals in this matter, I offer the following thoughts:</p>\n<p id=\"b577-8\">(1) The Michigan Constitution excepts from the referendum process \u201cacts making appropriations for state institutions.\u201d It may well have been preferable for the constitution instead to have excepted from the referendum process: (a) merely acts that are necessary in order for the state to \u201cexercise its various functions free from financial embarrassment\u201d; (b) merely acts appropriating monies without which state agencies \u201cwould cease to function,\u201d or without which their \u201ccontinued existence\u201d would be in jeopardy; or (c) merely acts that pertain to the \u201ccore functions,\u201d or that are not \u201cperipheral to the core purpose,\u201d of state <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"392\">*392</page-number>agencies.<footnotemark>1</footnotemark> However, the constitution did none of these. Rather, it excepted from the referendum process \u201cacts making appropriations for state institutions.\u201d In reading into the constitution these alternative limitations upon the referendum process, the Court of Appeals has, without warrant, substituted its own judgment concerning how the constitution <em>ought </em>to read in place of the judgment of those who actually proposed and ratified the constitution.</p>\n<p id=\"b578-5\">(2) In particular, the Court of Appeals has, without warrant, substituted its own judgment for that of \u201cWe, the people of the State of Michigan\u201d who \u201chave ordain[ed] and established] <em>this </em>constitution.\u201d<footnotemark>2</footnotemark> \u201cThis\u201d constitution is one that, for better or worse, excepts from the referendum process \u201cacts making appropriations for state institutions.\u201d It is not one that excepts from the referendum process a greater or a lesser range of legislative acts, depending upon the personal preferences of individual judges or the political imperatives of the moment.</p>\n<p id=\"b578-6\">(3) In a truly remarkable statement, the Court of Appeals asserts:</p>\n<blockquote id=\"b579-4\"><page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"393\">*393</page-number>[E]ven if we were to conclude that the statutory expenditures constituted appropriations for state institutions as contemplated by [the constitution], we would nevertheless hold that the overarching right of the people to their \u201cdirect legislative voice\u201d . . . requires that 2000 PA 381 be subject to referendum.</blockquote>\n<p id=\"b579-5\">I would respectfully suggest that the \u201coverarching right of the people\u201d is to have the constitution that they have ratified given respect and accorded its proper meaning. The fundamental flaw in the Court of Appeals statement is evident in its very assertion. Who is to say, for example, that this particular \u201coverarching right,\u201d \u201cthe right to a direct legislative voice,\u201d is <em>more </em>\u201coverarching\u201d than the right of the people to have the legislative judgment of their elected representatives given effect over the objections of five percent of the electorate? In truth, in a system of constitutional government, we examine the language of the constitution itself to determine which rights are \u201coverarching.\u201d Whether the referendum process or the legislative judgment should prevail in a particular case does not depend upon which right or which value is perceived to be more \u201coverarching\u201d by a judge, but rather upon which result is required by the terms of the constitution itself. There is, in fact, an \u201coverarching right\u201d to a referendum, but only in accordance with the standards of the constitution; otherwise, there is an \u201coverarching right\u201d to have public policy determined by a majority of the people\u2019s democratically elected representatives.</p>\n<p id=\"b579-6\">(4) It is hard to imagine a single statement more fundamentally at odds with the <em>genuinely </em>\u201coverarching right\u201d of the people to responsible constitutional government than that of the Court of Appeals. I repeat it, for it evidences a profound misunderstand<page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"394\">*394</page-number>ing about the proper role of the judiciary that demands response:</p>\n<blockquote id=\"b580-5\">[E]ven if we were to conclude that the statutory expenditures constituted appropriations for state institutions as contemplated by [the constitution], we would nevertheless hold that the overarching right of the people to their \u201cdirect legislative voice\u201d . . . requires that 2000 PA 381 be subject to referendum.</blockquote>\n<p id=\"b580-6\">What this apparently means is that, \u201c[e]ven if we were to conclude\u201d that the constitution stated one thing, the Court of Appeals panel would <em>still </em>abide by its own views in holding that the constitution meant a different thing. Thus, it could be that \u201c[e]ven if we were to conclude\u201d that the constitution prohibited prior restraints on the press, we would \u201cnevertheless hold\u201d that the \u201coverarching right\u201d of persons to a fair trial requires that newspapers not write irresponsibly about high-profile criminal cases. Or it could be that, \u201c[e]ven if we were to conclude\u201d that the constitution prohibited denying criminal defendants a right to a jury trial, we would \u201cnevertheless hold\u201d that the \u201coverarching right\u201d of judicial efficiency requires that exceptions sometimes be made to this requirement. In other words, no matter what the actual language of the constitution, the Court of Appeals panel will, in effect, create a \u201chigher\u201d constitutional law whose requirements will supersede those of the constitution ratified by \u201cwe, the people.\u201d This is not law; it is a prescription for judicial domination.</p>\n<p id=\"b580-7\">n. JUSTICE CAVANAGH\u2019S DISSENT</p>\n<p id=\"b580-8\">Concerning the dissent of Justice Cavanagh in this matter, I offer the following thoughts:</p>\n<p id=\"b581-4\"><page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"395\">*395</page-number>(1) In addition to the various standards fashioned by the Court of Appeals in replacing those set forth by the Michigan Constitution, the dissent adds the standard of \u201cgreat public significance.\u201d Apparently, the* greater the \u201cpublic significance\u201d of a law, the more essential it is that a referendum be allowed to proceed, notwithstanding the language of the constitution. For what it is worth, I am in complete agreement that 2000 PA 381 is a matter of \u201cgreat public significance\u201d and can easily appreciate why its opponents wish to make it the subject of a referendum. Nevertheless, it can be assumed that any measure that becomes the focus of a serious referendum effort will be a matter of \u201cgreat public significance\u201d and, in any event, the constitution does not make distinctions between those legislative enactments that some justices may view as of \u201cgreat public significance\u201d and those that are viewed as of lesser significance.</p>\n<p id=\"b581-5\">(2) Equally irrelevant to this Court\u2019s constitutional analysis are the dissent\u2019s various references to the \u201clame-duck\u201d character of the Legislature<footnotemark>3</footnotemark>; the fact that \u201cfirearms advocates and persons interested in hunting\u201d are \u201cpitted\u201d against a \u201ccoalition of law enforcement, religious, and educational interest\u201d; and the fact that some individual members of the Legislature view their colleagues as having improper motives in attaching an appropriations provision to 2000 PA 381.</p>\n<p id=\"b582-4\"><page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"396\">*396</page-number>(3) The dissent chastises the majority for having \u201cneglected to recite\u201d certain facts in its opinion. With all due respect, the majority has done no such thing. It has merely neglected to \u201crecite\u201d facts that are wholly irrelevant to its legal analysis, as is typically the case in our opinions. The majority, for example, views it as irrelevant for purposes of its legal analysis that the law under consideration is of \u201cgreat public significance,\u201d or, in particular, that the law relates to a highly divisive political controversy. Rather, the constitution means exactly the same thing whether the law at issue pertains to firearms, to farming irrigation, or to any other conceivable subject matter. Therefore, reciting the details or the political or legislative history of the statute before us, beyond identifying the appropriations that it makes, would add nothing to the constitutional analysis. Furthermore, contrary to what would have been the case if the dissent\u2019s position had prevailed, \u201cfuture litigants,\u201d concerning whom the dissent expresses such concern, will henceforth be apprised of the unvarying meaning of the constitution, and will not be required to count noses about how many justices view the law at issue in <em>their </em>future case as being of \u201cgreat public significance,\u201d or whether the appropriations made in <em>their </em>future case involve a \u201ccore function\u201d or are essential to the \u201ccontinued existence\u201d of some state agency.</p>\n<p id=\"b582-5\">(4) The dissent describes the majority\u2019s constitutional analysis as one that \u201cfocuses narrowly on the superficially straightforward question,\u201d as being \u201clegalistic,\u201d as being \u201cpinched,\u201d and as being \u201coverly literal.\u201d Such descriptions are typical of those uttered when a judge is frustrated in his ability to reach a particular result by the actual language of the law. <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"397\">*397</page-number>Contrary to the dissent, the majority does not interpret the constitution \u201cliterally\u201d or \u201clegalistically.\u201d There is simply no reasonable alternative interpretation to the words \u201cacts making appropriations for state institutions.\u201d Again, it may well be that the dissent\u2019s formulation of the right of referendum is preferable to that of the constitution. However, such a determination is not for this Court to make \u2014 no matter how \u201cpublicly significant\u201d a law. As Chief Justice Marshall recognized in <em>Marbury v </em>Madison, nearly two centuries ago, it is the responsibility of the judiciary to say what the law \u201cis,\u201d not what it believes that it \u201cought\u201d to be.<footnotemark>4</footnotemark></p>\n<p id=\"b583-5\">(5) The dissent\u2019s reference to Justice Cooley\u2019s rules of constitutional interpretation is apt, but misses the point. Constitutional interpretation varies from statutory interpretation principally because constitutional language tends to be more concise, and to relate to broader expressions of principle, than does statutory language. The language of constitutions, therefore, also tends to be more susceptible to multiple interpretations than does the more precise and more thorough language of statutes. Justice Cooley\u2019s rules make clear how, in a constitutional context, broad language and general words are to be given reasonable meaning. When, however, constitutional language <em>is </em>straightforward, such as the eligibility requirements for a member of Congress,<footnotemark>5</footnotemark> or the procedural requirements of the legislative process,<footnotemark>6</footnotemark> we accord such language its plain and ordinary meaning. <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"398\">*398</page-number>\u201c[Reasonable minds, the great mass of the people themselves\u201d tend to accord words such plain and ordinary meanings. Contrary to the dissent, Justice Cooley did not assert, in effect, that \u201capple\u201d can mean \u201corange,\u201d if a group of citizens could be found who understood it in this sense. Rather, what he asserted was that <em>ambiguous </em>terms, those fairly susceptible to multiple understandings, should be assessed by his rules. The \u201ccommon understanding\u201d of most words is that they possess their plain and ordinary meanings.<footnotemark>7</footnotemark></p>\n<p id=\"b584-5\">(6) It should be noted that the dissent does not ultimately rest its interpretation upon any specific language or phrase contained in the constitution, since it cannot do so. Instead, it relies upon such amorphous concepts as \u201cthe overall approach\u201d to legislation taken by the constitution\u2019s framers and the people who ratified it. But, rather than taking the framers and ratifiers of the constitution at face value and assuming that they intended what they plainly wrote, the dissent manages creatively to conclude that the framers and ratifiers meant something other than what they wrote. On what basis does it reach <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"399\">*399</page-number>such a conclusion? Does the dissent identify convincing statements in support of that proposition by the framers? Does the dissent point to evidence that \u201cwe, the People\u201d were misled into believing that \u201cacts\u201d or \u201cappropriations\u201d really did not mean \u201cacts\u201d or \u201cappropriations?\u201d Does the dissent offer new historical information that the ratifiers understood that <em>Detroit Automobile Club, </em>and other earlier decisions of this Court, were being reversed by the Constitution of 1963? No, there is no argument of this kind.<footnotemark>8</footnotemark> All that we are left with is that the dissent believes that the drafters of the constitution, and \u201cWe, the People\u201d who ratified it, <em>should have </em>adopted the referendum provision that it prefers.<footnotemark>9</footnotemark></p>\n<p id=\"b585-5\">m. JUSTICE WEAVER\u2019S DISSENT</p>\n<p id=\"b585-6\">Concerning the dissent of Justice Weaver in this matter, I offer the following thoughts:</p>\n<p id=\"b586-4\"><page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"400\">*400</page-number>(1) The dissent asserts that <em>Detroit Automobile Club </em>stands for the proposition that only appropriations that \u201cenable the state to exercise its various functions free from financial embarrassment,\u201d or without which state agencies would \u201ccease to function,\u201d are excepted from the referendum process. However, <em>Detroit Automobile Club, </em>does not say this at all; rather, it merely stands for the proposition that the Michigan Highway Department is a \u201cstate institution.\u201d It does not even purport to address the issue of what constitutes \u201cacts making appropriations.\u201d Of course, even if the decision <em>had </em>said what the dissent asserts, no decision of this Court can permanently transform the plain language of the constitution.</p>\n<p id=\"b586-5\">(2) The dissent asserts that \u201cthe majority fails to recognize the importance of the referendum, and this Court\u2019s responsibility to protect the people\u2019s power of the referendum, derived from the constitution . . . .\u201d However, a better characterization of this Court\u2019s \u201cresponsibility,\u201d in my judgment, is that we have a responsibility to protect the people\u2019s power of referendum as set forth by the constitution, <em>and </em>we have a responsibility to protect the people\u2019s power of representative self-government as set forth by the constitution. Indeed, the principal \u201cresponsibility\u201d of this Court is to read the language of the constitution faithfully. If the people wish to modify their constitution, they may do so under the terms of article 12, and the majority will attempt to interpret the modified constitution faithfully. But the majority will not act as a continuing constitutional convention and dilute the people\u2019s right to have their supreme law mean what it says.</p>\n<p id=\"b587-4\"><page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"401\">*401</page-number>IV. JUSTICE KELLY\u2019S DISSENT</p>\n<p id=\"b587-5\">Concerning the dissent of Justice Kelly in this matter, I offer the following thoughts:</p>\n<p id=\"b587-6\">(1) The dissent contends that the majority \u201cignores\u201d the meaning of the word \u201cfor\u201d as used in the constitutional provision \u201cacts making appropriations for state institutions.\u201d I respectfully disagree. The relevant meaning of \u201cfor\u201d in the instant context is \u201cintended to belong to.\u201d<footnotemark>10</footnotemark> Clearly, in this case, the appropriation was \u201cintended to belong to\u201d the Department of State Police. Demonstrating that no word is too straightforward not to be transmuted beyond recognition, the dissent manages to conclude that what the framers and the people meant by using the word \u201cfor\u201d was that only \u201cappropriations aimed at satisfying the purpose or reason for which a state institution exists\u201d are excepted from the referendum process. The premise of this interpretation appears to be that there is a meaningful distinction between an agency <em>qua </em>agency, and the functions that are performed by such agency, i.e., that there is some disembodied assemblage of functions that are carried out by an agency that define its \u201cessence\u201d or \u201ccore\u201d as distinct from the total array of functions that it is charged by the law with carrying out. This is plainly without any basis. If the Legislature determined tomorrow that the Department of State Police should, in addition to its current responsibilities, be assigned new responsibilities now belonging to the Department of Corrections, monies appropriated for such new responsibilities would be every bit as much \u201cfor\u201d the Department of <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"402\">*402</page-number>State Police as monies appropriated \u201cfor\u201d its current responsibilities. I am aware of no textual or other basis for understanding \u201cfor\u201d to mean anything at all different in these circumstances.</p>\n<p id=\"b588-5\">(2) The dissent accurately asserts that \u201c[w]e start by examining the provision\u2019s plain meaning as understood by its ratifiers at the time of its adoption.\u201d I agree with that statement and I believe that this is exactly what the majority has done. The dissent has failed to produce a scintilla of evidence to demonstrate that the people of this state in 1963 understood the language \u201cacts making appropriations for state institutions\u201d to mean anything other than what it plainly says.</p>\n<p id=\"b588-6\">(3) Because the dissent is unable to produce evidence to contradict the idea that the people intended their constitution to mean what its words convey, in the end, it also relies upon such amorphous concepts as \u201cthe fundamental purpose of the general power of referendum\u201d to justify its interpretation of the law. However, there is no \u201cgeneral power\u201d of referendum in Michigan, but only a specific power of referendum as defined by the constitution. And whatever \u201cfundamental purpose\u201d can be discerned to the referendum power, such a purpose must be subordinate to the \u201cfundamental purpose\u201d of a constitution itself, which is that it establishes the ground rules for a system of self-government, and its words, where plain, must be taken seriously.</p>\n<p id=\"b588-7\">V. FINAL QUERY FOR THE DISSENTERS</p>\n<p id=\"b588-8\">Finally, I would address the following question to each of my dissenting colleagues: Had those who pro<page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"403\">*403</page-number>posed and ratified our constitution truly intended to limit the referendum power as the majority interprets it, how should they, how could they, have fashioned it any more clearly than they did in article 2, \u00a7 9? That is, what words should they have used that they did not?<footnotemark>11</footnotemark></p>\n<p id=\"b589-5\">VI. CONCLUSION</p>\n<p id=\"b589-6\">I respectfully believe that the Court of Appeals and my dissenting colleagues, by transforming the plain meaning of the words of the constitution, would engage the judiciary in an exercise far beyond its competence and authority. While I can certainly understand the frustrations of those who disapprove of the substance of 2000 PA 381, such frustrations should not be viewed as a justification for giving a meaning to the constitution that is so irreconcilable with its language.<footnotemark>12</footnotemark></p>\n<footnote label=\"1\">\n<p id=\"b578-7\"> The Court of Appeals asserts that these alternative formulations, each of which it has incorporated in its opinion, were set forth by this Court in <em>Detroit Automobile Club v Secretary of </em>State, 230 Mich 623; 203 NW 529 (1925), in the course of our interpreting the predecessor version of the current Michigan Constitution. However, such language, to the extent that it can be discerned at all in <em>Detroit Automobile Club, </em>was set forth in the altogether different context of determining whether the state highway department was or was not a \u201cstate institution.\u201d It was not done in the context of determining whether an enactment of the Legislature was an \u201cact[] making appropriations.\u201d Furthermore, this Court in 1925, as in 2001, could not alter the language of the constitution, and it did not purport to do so.</p>\n</footnote>\n<footnote label=\"2\">\n<p id=\"b578-8\"> Const 1963, Preamble (emphasis added).</p>\n</footnote>\n<footnote label=\"3\">\n<p id=\"b581-6\"> The dissent describes the majority as \u201cgranting the lame-duck legislative majority the prize it apparently sought . . . .\u201d However, as the dissent well appreciates, judges are not in the business of \u201cgranting prizes\u201d to either side of a controversy; rather, they are in the business of interpreting the language of the law and letting the chips fall where they may.</p>\n</footnote>\n<footnote label=\"4\">\n<p id=\"b583-6\"> <em>Marbury v Madison, </em>5 US (1 Cranch) 137; 2 L Ed 60 (1803).</p>\n</footnote>\n<footnote label=\"5\">\n<p id=\"b583-7\"> <em>Powell v McCormack, </em>395 US 486; 89 S Ct 1944; 23 L Ed 2d 491 (1969).</p>\n</footnote>\n<footnote label=\"6\">\n<p id=\"b583-8\"> <em>Clinton v New York City, </em>524 US 417; 118 S Ct 2091; 141 L Ed 2d 393 (1998).</p>\n</footnote>\n<footnote label=\"7\">\n<p id=\"b584-6\"> The dissent\u2019s \u201cgenerous\u201d reading of the constitution is only \u201cgenerous\u201d if one starts with the point of view that a referendum should proceed on the law in controversy. If, on the other hand, one wishes to have the law take normal effect, without awaiting the next general election, then perhaps the dissent\u2019s reading might be characterized by some as somewhat less \u201cgenerous.\u201d Although, in my judgment, the constitution should be interpreted \u201cfaithfully,\u201d rather than \u201cgenerously\u201d or \u201cnon-generously,\u201d it is difficult for me to understand how <em>any </em>interpretation can be drawn from the language of the referendum clause, no matter how \u201cgenerous,\u201d that leads to the conclusion reached by the dissent. It is unclear whether the dissent believes that the msyority has misconstrued \u201cacts\u201d or \u201cmaking\u201d or \u201cappropriations\u201d or \"for\u201d or \u201cstate\u201d or \u201cinstitutions,\u201d or how such words have been misconstrued.

I do not know whether the dissent is right or wrong in this proposition, for it sets forth no evidence in this regard and I am aware of no such evidence. However, at the very least, the dissent is obligated to demonstrate in regard to its assertion: (a) why it should be assumed that the \u201cgreat mass of the people\u201d did not understand that their words would be taken seriously and accorded their common understanding; and (b) why a substantial majority of the people\u2019s representatives in the Legislature, the overwhelming number of whom had just been reelected and who had been fully apprised by opponents of 2000 PA 381 of the latter\u2019s views on the impropriety of attaching an appropriations provision to this measure, cannot be assumed to have been representing the actual sentiments of the \u201cgreat mass of the people.\u201d</p>\n</footnote>\n<footnote label=\"9\">\n<p id=\"b585-8\"> The dissent is harsh in its characterization of the Legislature\u2019s \u201clegerdemain\u201d in attaching an appropriations provision to 2000 PA 381. Possibly, this is a deserved characterization. But, any such skills in this regard by the Legislature can hardly compare to the \u201clegerdemain\u201d (or, indeed, the alchemy) on the part of the dissent in transforming an otherwise clear and straightforward statement of law into something of altogether different meaning.</p>\n</footnote>\n<footnote label=\"10\">\n<p id=\"b587-7\"> <em>Random House Webster\u2019s College Dictionary </em>(1991) at 519.</p>\n</footnote>\n<footnote label=\"11\">\n<p id=\"b589-8\"> In this regard, I can recall the member of Congress who, in frustration over a judicial interpretation of a statute that, in his opinion, ignored its plain language, reintroduced the identical statute, but appended at its conclusion, \u201cand we mean it this time!\u201d</p>\n</footnote>\n<footnote label=\"12\">\n<p id=\"b589-9\"> In light of the confusion generated, let me make clear, for what it is worth, that I, as a part of the citizenry of Michigan, would also prefer a broader referendum clause in our constitution, one less susceptible to avoidance by appropriations of the type contained in 2000 PA 381. However, until such a referendum clause is adopted by the prescribed constitutional process, see Const 1963, art 12, I will continue to interpret, as best as I can, the referendum clause that has actually been ratified by the people. Furthermore, let me make clear that I am not oblivious to the debate over the motives of the Legislature in attaching the instant appropriations to 2000 PA 381.

This case presents issues involving the Legislature\u2019s constitutional authority and the authority of the people of Michigan \u2014 expressly <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"404\">*404</page-number>reserved in our 1963 Constitution \u2014 to vote on matters of great public significance. The statute in this case affects just such an issue of great public significance, involving the delicate balance between the free exercise of Second Amendment rights and the fundamental obligation of government to protect its citizens\u2019 physical safety. Understandably, this case has energized opposing groups of citizens to a degree rarely seen in public debate.<footnotemark>1</footnotemark></p>\n<p id=\"b590-4\">Similarly, this case has energized this Court, prompting each justice to offer an opinion. I join in and agree with the reasoning offered in the dissenting opinions by Justice Kelly and Justice Weaver. However, I offer this opinion to address my specific concerns with the majority\u2019s decision.</p>\n<p id=\"b590-5\">The facts, which the actual majority opinion has neglected to recite to either explain its opinion or to serve future litigants as precedent, and which appear only in the seriatim concurrences, are not in dispute. For many years, Michigan has restricted citizens\u2019 <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"405\">*405</page-number>rights to carry concealed weapons. To obtain a permit to carry a concealed weapon from a county concealed weapons board, a person has needed to demonstrate \u201cproper reasons\u201d to carry a concealed weapon. See MCL 28.426, repealed by 2000 PA 381. Under the former system, the popular perception was that the permits were difficult to obtain.</p>\n<p id=\"b591-5\">Proposed legislation to change this system was introduced in the 90th Legislature, but it had few prospects for approval. However, a legislative majority discovered new prospects after the November 2000 election, when the Legislature reconvened to conduct its biennial \u201clame duck\u201d session.<footnotemark>2</footnotemark> In 2000 PA 381, the Legislature adopted what is popularly known as \u201cshall issue\u201d legislation, providing that county boards must issue concealed weapons permits to applicants when certain unremarkable conditions are met. See MCL 28.425b(7).</p>\n<p id=\"b591-6\">Despite the timing of its passage, this profound change in Michigan law did not go unnoticed. Opposition quickly formed, but to no immediate avail. However, opponents of the new law realized the great public interest in this measure, and the likelihood that Michigan citizens on both sides of the issue would want to make their views known. Therefore, opponents began publicly to discuss invoking the referendum process that the people of Michigan reserved for themselves in Const 1963, art 2, \u00a7 9.</p>\n<p id=\"b591-7\">In that constitutional provision, the people kept the right to vote on laws enacted by the Legislature. The people of Michigan have long reserved this right, first <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"406\">*406</page-number>providing for it in Michigan\u2019s 1908 Constitution. See Const 1908, art 5, \u00a7 1. Recent examples of the people exercising this right occurred with the controversial legislation discussed in <em>Doe v Dep\u2019t of Social Services, </em>439 Mich 650, 658; 487 NW2d 166 (1992), and with the measures discussed in <em>Bingo Coalition for </em>Charity\u2014<em>Not Politics v Bd of State Canvassers, </em>215 Mich App 405; 546 NW2d 637 (1996).</p>\n<p id=\"b592-4\">The referendum power is not unlimited, however. The framers of the constitution \u2014 and the people of Michigan when they ratified the constitution \u2014 wisely limited the referendum power so that it would not \u201cextend to acts making appropriations for state institutions . . .,\u201d Const 1963, art 2, \u00a7 9. For obvious reasons, the state\u2019s fulfillment of its financial obligations cannot be subject to the delay and uncertainty inherent in the referendum process. Indeed, as this Court has stated, the limitation is designed to \u201cenable the State to exercise its various functions free from financial embarrassment.\u201d <em>Detroit Automobile Club v Secretary of State, </em>230 Mich 623, 625; 203 NW 529 (1925).</p>\n<p id=\"b592-5\">The concealed weapons legislation that is the subject of this suit acquired, late in the enactment process, some language that provided for a $1 million grant to the Michigan State Police. See MCL 28.425w. Intervening defendant People Who Care About Kids seeks to establish that the monetary provision of 2000 PA 381 will have no effect on the state\u2019s ability to function normally, and is not necessary to save the state from financial embarrassment. Rather, intervening defendant suggests that the monetary provision of the act was added specifically to evade the people\u2019s right to review the wisdom of the concealed weapons <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"407\">*407</page-number>provisions in that act.<footnotemark>3</footnotemark> That is, intervening defendant states that although 2000 PA 381 will fundamentally change Michigan law governing concealed weapons permits, a legislative majority acted with the specific intent to deny Michigan citizens their right to decide whether most people should be legally allowed to carry concealed firearms.</p>\n<p id=\"b593-5\">In answering this argument, the majority focuses narrowly on the superficially straightforward question whether 2000 PA 381 fits within the phrase \u201cacts making appropriations for state institutions.\u201d <em>Ante </em>at 365. As the reader has seen, the majority has no problem answering that question affirmatively, granting the lame-duck legislative majority the prize it apparently sought: freedom to change the concealed weapons law without public review through the referendum process.</p>\n<p id=\"b593-6\">Despite the legalistic temptation to focus on the seemingly literal language of a single phrase in a single sentence, the pertinent sentence here is but one sentence in our state constitution. Constitutional analysis must not be overly literal; it is an undertaking <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"408\">*408</page-number>that must be approached in an entirely different light. Long ago, Michigan\u2019s great constitutional scholar Justice COOLEY set forth for his many successors on this Court the primary rule of constitutional interpretation, the rule of \u201ccommon understanding,\u201d described in his treatise Constitutional Limitations, p 81, to which this Court has turned so frequently. This Court gave a fully developed explanation of the rule in <em>Traverse City Sch Dist v Attorney General, </em>384 Mich 390, 405-406; 185 NW2d 9 (1971):</p>\n<blockquote id=\"b594-6\">This case requires the construction of a constitution, where the technical rules of statutory construction do not apply. <em>McCulloch v Maryland, </em>17 US (4 Wheat) 316, 407; 4 L Ed 579 (1819).</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b594-7\">The primary rule is the rule of \u201ccommon understanding\u201d described by Justice Cooley:</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b594-8\">\u201cA constitution is made for the people and by the people. <em>The interpretation that should be given it is that which reasonable minds, the great mass of the people themselves, would give it. </em>\u2018For as the Constitution does not derive its force from the convention which framed it, but from the people who ratified it, <em>the intent to be arrived at is that of the people, </em>and it is not to be supposed that they have looked for any dark or abstruse meaning in the words employed, <em>but rather that they have accepted them in the sense most obvious to the common understanding, </em>and ratified the instrument in the belief that that was the sense designed to be conveyed.\u2019 (Cooley\u2019s Const Lim 81.) (Emphasis added.)\u201d</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b594-9\">A second rule is that to clarify meaning, the circumstances surrounding the adoption of a constitutional provision and the purpose sought to be accomplished may be considered. On this point this Court has said the following:</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"AqY\">\u201cIn construing constitutional provisions where the meaning may be questioned, the court should have regard to the <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"409\">*409</page-number>circumstances leading to their adoption and the purpose sought to be accomplished. <em>Kearney v Bd of State Auditors </em>[189 Mich 666, 673; 155 NW 510 (1915)].\u201d</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b595-5\">A third rule is that wherever possible an interpretation that does not create constitutional invalidity is preferred to one that does. Chief Justice Marshall pursued this thought fully in <em>Marbury v Madison </em>[5 US (1 Cranch) 137, 175; 2 L Ed 60 (1803)], which we quote in part:</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b595-6\">\u201cIf any other construction would render the clause inoperative, that is an additional reason for rejecting such other construction . . . .\u201d</blockquote>\n<p id=\"b595-7\">These are the principles we must apply when interpreting our state constitution.</p>\n<p id=\"b595-8\">The first and second principles stated in <em>Traverse City Sch Dist </em>greatly help in answering the question presented in this case. Under those rules, we are to set aside the \u201ctechnical rules of statutory construction\u201d and the quest for \u201cdark or abstruse meaning\u201d in favor of the interpretation that \u201creasonable minds, the great mass of the people themselves,\u201d would give the state constitution. Without question, that exercise must be carried out in light of the whole document. Further, it must involve a generous reading of the people\u2019s will, freed of a lawyer\u2019s instinct toward pinched constructions of narrow phrases.</p>\n<p id=\"b595-9\">When considered as a whole, the constitution provides various explanations of, and restrictions on, the legislative process. A broad examination of the provisions of article 4 evidences that the framers and the people placed an extremely high value on the integrity and accountability of this process. There, the constitution prohibits the Legislature from playing deceptive games in the course of enacting legislation,<footnotemark>4</footnotemark> and <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"410\">*410</page-number>further seeks to assure that legislation is given meaningful consideration before it is adopted.=<footnotemark>5</footnotemark> Article 4 also notes the special nature of appropriations bills.<footnotemark>6</footnotemark> Finally, the reserved role of the people is noted in article 4,<footnotemark>7</footnotemark> as well as in other provisions of the Constitution. See Const 1963, art 2, \u00a7 9; art 12, \u00a7 2.</p>\n<p id=\"b597-4\"><page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"411\">*411</page-number>In light of these provisions and the overall approach to legislation taken by the constitution\u2019s framers and the people who ratified it, I am convinced that the Court of Appeals correctly decided this case. I am confident that the constitutional right of referendum, in this narrow context, should not be taken away by so transparent an artifice. Justice Cooley\u2019s \u201cgreat mass of the people\u201d would, if asked, surely suppose that \u201cacts making appropriations for state institutions,\u201d which deny the people\u2019s reserved power of referendum, are general appropriations bills containing substantial grants to state agencies. Those grants would have to ensure the viability of the agencies or, as the Court of Appeals put it, support the agencies\u2019 \u201ccore functions.\u201d 246 Mich App 82; 630 NW2d 376 (2001). The people of Michigan, I am certain, never intended to authorize the 2000 lame-duck Legislature\u2019s legerdemain.</p>\n<p id=\"b597-5\">Additionally, the third principle stated in <em>Traverse City Sch Dist </em>provides further support for this conclusion. That principle is that when possible, we must prefer an interpretation that does not create a constitutional invalidity over an interpretation that does.<footnotemark>8</footnotemark></p>\n<p id=\"b598-3\"><page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"412\">*412</page-number>The referendum power, of course, is the people\u2019s reserved check on the Legislature. In <em>Kuhn v Dep\u2019t of Treasury, </em>384 Mich 378, 385, n 10; 183 NW2d 796 (1971), this Court, ironically, referred to the referendum power as a \u201cgun-behind-the-door to be taken up on those occasions when the legislature itself does not respond to popular demands.\u201d However, with its decision in this case, the majority removes the people\u2019s check, taking the gun from behind the door and handing it to the Legislature. By holding that the money inserted into 2000 PA 381 circumvents the people\u2019s reserved referendum power, the majority holds that the referendum power exists at the Legislature\u2019s pleasure. Whenever the Legislature wants to avoid the people\u2019s check on its power, it need only insert some money into a bill, apparently even a de minimis amount, to get around that power. The people\u2019s check on the Legislature will thus become invalid because the people will only have the \u201cgun-behind-the-door\u201d when the Legislature gives it to them. Such an interpretation is certainly at odds with this Court\u2019s commitment to liberally construe constitutional provi<page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"413\">*413</page-number>sions reserving for the people a direct legislative voice, see <em>Kuhn, supra </em>at 385, but further leaves the people\u2019s reserved referendum power, in a word, useless.</p>\n<p id=\"b599-5\">In its short opinion, the majority cites \u201can unbroken line of decisions of this Court interpreting [the referendum power].\u201d <em>Ante </em>at 366. The line is unbroken because it reflects this Court\u2019s dual commitments to the people\u2019s right to vote on matters of great public significance and to the taxpayers\u2019 right to a state government that maintains responsible and functional taxation and appropriation policies. At times, the latter commitment has required that we give effect to the constitutional insulation against referring appropriations measures and related financial enactments. Never, though, has the \u201cunbroken line\u201d veered in the direction approved in this case.</p>\n<p id=\"b599-6\">Also, I find it as inevitable as night following day that the concurrences would characterize the lengthy, thoughtful majority opinion as \u201cadmirably concise,\u201d <em>ante </em>at 368 (Young, J., concurring), and as setting \u201cforth its analysis simply and straightforwardly\u201d and doing so because \u201cthe constitutional issue before us is simple and straightforward.\u201d <em>Ante </em>at 391 (Makkman, J., concurring). Yet, as self-evident as the majority believes its result to be, the orchestrated, explanatory concurrences appeared following this dissent. In my view, these serial apologias do nothing to alter the majority\u2019s disembowelment of the public\u2019s constitutionally guaranteed right to referendum.</p>\n<p id=\"b599-7\">So, despite the constitutional structure and the people\u2019s desire for a check on the Legislature, the majority concludes that the Legislature can decide when the people will have that check. I reiterate that rea<page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"414\">*414</page-number>sonable minds may differ about the underlying substance of this case. Some say public safety and ordinary social intercourse will be disturbed by a radical switch in state concealed weapons policy, while others say that public safety will be enhanced when responsible citizens can carry weapons. I say, and do not believe reasonable minds can dispute, that the constitution says that the people must be allowed to vote.</p>\n<judges id=\"b600-6\">Kelly, J., concurred with Cavanagh, J.</judges>\n<footnote label=\"1\">\n<p id=\"b590-6\"> The many concerned citizens on both sides defy easy description. To oversimplify, the background dispute over the place of weapons in our society pits firearm advocates and persons interested in hunting against a coalition of law enforcement, religious, and educational interests.</p>\n<p id=\"b590-7\">In his concurrence, Justice Young characterizes my observations as a \u201cgenerous\u201d statement of my own \u201cextensive personal views\u201d of the \u201cpolitical issue\u201d underlying this case. <em>Ante </em>at 368-369 (Young, J., concurring). While he is certainly correct that this \u201cpolitical issue\u201d is not before the Court, his conclusion that I have somehow aired my views of the matter is baffling. This dissent merely states that the underlying matter, which led to the referendum drive, is significant and that thoughtful people may disagree about it. If that is a \u201cgenerous\u201d statement of my \u201cextensive personal views,\u201d then apparently Justice Young is equally copious about the matter, see <em>id,., </em>and one can only wonder what Justice Young would conclude about Justice Markman\u2019s generosity. See <em>ante </em>at 395 (Markman, J., concurring) (\u201cFor what it is worth, I am in complete agreement that 2000 PA 381 is a matter of \u2018great public significance\u2019 and can easily appreciate why its opponents wish to malee it the subject of a referendum\u201d).</p>\n</footnote>\n<footnote label=\"2\">\n<p id=\"b591-8\"> Because of its timing, the lame-duck session is understood to be a period of diminished public accountability. See, e.g., Farber &amp; Frickey, <em>Public choice revisited, </em>96 Mich L R 1715, 1729 (1998).</p>\n</footnote>\n<footnote label=\"3\">\n<p id=\"b593-7\"> Various Michigan legislators would agree with intervening defendant. For example, protesting the new law, Senator Byrum stated that \u201cwe know that the only reason there was an appropriation . . . was to block the referendum, block the people\u2019s right to disagree with the action of their Legislature,\u201d 2000 Journal of the Senate 2125, and Senator Gast said that the appropriation \u201cwas put in to make it bulletproof and ballot-proof, and I think it\u2019s kind of deceptive.\u201d White, <em>Lawyers, guns and money: weapons petitions go to court, </em>Grand Rapids Press, June 10, 2001 at A18. Similarly, Representative Wojno stated that \u201cthe reason that the proponents of this legislation added this appropriation ... is inappropriate and insidious. They apparently believe that in doing so they can circumvent Article II, Section 9 of the Michigan Constitution, and silence the voices of the majority of the people of this State,\u201d while Representative Jellema added that the eleventh-hour addition of the appropriation \u201cfurther diminishes the right of voters to express their views on this very important issue.\u201d 2000 Journal of the House 2682, 2683.</p>\n</footnote>\n<footnote label=\"4\">\n<p id=\"b595-10\"> Const 1963, art 4, \u00a7\u00a7 24 and 25, provides this protection, stating:</p>\n<blockquote id=\"Arrg\"><page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"410\">*410</page-number>No law shall embrace more than one object, which shall be expressed in its title.

This language was retained by them in the 1963 Constitution without modification in response to the earlier decisions. Under well-established principles, it is not open to us to place a new construction on this language. <em>[Bds of Co Rd Comm\u2019rs, supra </em>at 676.]</blockquote>\n<p id=\"b604-6\">Because the reasoning in <em>Detroit Automobile Club </em>was the sole and uncontradicted interpretation of \u201cacts making appropriations for state institutions,\u201d I believe that its reasoning is the best evidence of the framers understanding of this language and perhaps the explanation why there is so little discussion of its meaning in the record of the convention.</p>\n<p id=\"b604-7\">Applying <em>Detroit Automobile Club </em>to the facts of this case, the money appropriated in 2000 PA 381 is not necessary for the State Police to \u201cexercise its various functions free from financial embarrassment,\u201d but rather is necessary only to implement the act itself. <em>Detroit Automobile Club, supra </em>at 625-626. The State Police would not cease to function without the appropriation. The effect of referendum on 2000 PA 381 on the functioning of the State Police stands in contrast to the concerns of the Court in the \u201cgas tax cases.\u201d <em>Moreton, supra; Good Roads, supra; </em>and <em>Co Rd Ass\u2019n of Michigan, supra. </em>In the \u201cgas tax cases,\u201d the Court concluded that the building of good roads is an important state function. Further, the Court concluded the appropriations at issue in the \u201cgas tax cases\u201d were made to \u201cenable it to function in that regard, and, being made for that purpose, . . . are not subject to referendum.\u201d <em>Moreton, supra </em>at 592.<footnotemark>5</footnotemark></p>\n<p id=\"b605-2\"><page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"419\">*419</page-number>Further, I believe that the majority fails to recognize the importance of the referendum, and this Court\u2019s responsibility to protect the people\u2019s power of the referendum, as derived from the constitution and as outlined in <em>Michigan Farm Bureau v Hare, </em>379 Mich 387, 393; 151 NW2d 797 (1967):</p>\n<blockquote id=\"b605-3\">There is nevertheless an overriding rule of constitutional construction which requires that the commonly understood referral process, forming as it does a specific power the people themselves have expressly reserved, be saved if possible as against conceivable if not likely evasion or parry by the legislature.

I cannot believe that this outcome is the interpretation that \u201creasonable minds, the great <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"420\">*420</page-number>mass of the people themselves, would give it.\u201d <em>Traverse City Sch Dist v Attorney General, </em>384 Mich 390, 405; 185 NW2d 9 (1971), quoting Cooley\u2019s Const Lim 81. I agree with Justice Cavanagh that by determining that the inclusion of a monetary provision in 2000 PA 381 circumvents the people\u2019s reserved referendum power, the majority effectively holds \u201cthat the referendum power exists at the Legislature\u2019s pleasure.\u201d <em>Ante </em>at 412.</p>\n<p id=\"b606-5\">Finally, it is essential to recognize that the issue before us is one of constitutional interpretation. My opinion on the issue of constitutional law in this case does not address and should not be read to reflect one way or the other a position on the merits of the concealed weapons act passed by the Legislature.</p>\n<p id=\"b606-6\">I would affirm the result of the Court of Appeals.</p>\n<footnote label=\"1\">\n<p id=\"b600-10\"> In 1974 this Court held that \u201cThe referendary provision and exceptions of the 1908 Constitution were retained in the 1963 Constitution as art 2, \u00a7 9 <em>without change in the pertinent language.\u201d Bds of Co Rd Comm\u2019rs v Bd of State Canvassers, </em>391 Mich 666, 674-675; 218 NW2d 144 (1974) (emphasis added).</p>\n</footnote>\n<footnote label=\"2\">\n<p id=\"b601-8\"> Art 5, \u00a7 21 provided in pertinent part:</p>\n<blockquote id=\"b601-9\">No act shall take effect or be in force until the expiration of ninety days from the end of the session at which the same is passed, except that the legislature may give immediate effect to acts making appropriations and acts immediately necessary for the preservation of the public peace, health or safety by a % vote of the members elected to each house.</blockquote>\n</footnote>\n<footnote label=\"3\">\n<p id=\"b603-7\"> The 1939 decision in <em>Todd v Hull, </em>288 Mich 521; 285 NW 46 (1939), did briefly discuss art 5, \u00a7 1 of the 1908 Constitution (the predecessor to Const 1963, ait 2, \u00a7 9), although <em>Todd\u2019s </em>primary focus was on whether 1939 PA 3 was immediately necessary for the preservation of the public peace, health, or safety within the contemplation of art 5, \u00a7 21, of the 1908 Constitution.

Thus, I would affirm the decision of the Court of Appeals and hold the act subject to referendum. I write separately, however, to make several points.</p>\n<p id=\"b606-8\">I. THE CONSTITUTIONAL MEANING OF \u201cACTS MAKING APPROPRIATIONS FOR STATE INSTITUTIONS\u201d</p>\n<p id=\"b606-9\">In Const 1963, art 2, \u00a7 9, the people reserved the power of referendum. They limited it, saying it \u201cdoes not extend to acts making appropriations for state institutions . . . .\u201d The question in the present case is whether a referendum of Act 381 is possible, because the act makes \u201cappropriations for state institutions.\u201d</p>\n<p id=\"b606-10\">When construing provisions of our constitution, this Court uses the rale of \u201ccommon understanding.\u201d <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"421\">*421</page-number>See <em>American Axle &amp; Mfg, Inc v Hamtramck, </em>461 Mich 352, 362; 604 NW2d 330 (2000); <em>Federated Publications, Inc v Michigan State Univ Bd of Trustees, </em>460 Mich 75, 84; 594 NW2d 491 (1999). The rule requires \u201cascertain[ing] as best the Court may the general understanding and therefore the uppermost or dominant purpose of the people when they approved the provision or provisions . . . .\u201d <em>Michigan Farm Bureau v Secretary of State, </em>379 Mich 387, 390-391; 151 NW2d 797 (1967); <em>Traverse City Sch Dist v Attorney General, </em>384 Mich 390, 405-406; 185 NW2d 9 (1971).</p>\n<p id=\"b607-5\">We start by examining the provision\u2019s plain meaning as understood by its ratifiers at the time of its adoption. See <em>American Axle &amp; Mfg, Inc, supra </em>at 362. Article 2, \u00a7 9 provides:</p>\n<blockquote id=\"b607-6\">The people reserve to themselves the power to propose laws and to enact and reject laws, called the initiative, and the power to approve or reject laws enacted by the legislature, called the referendum. The power of initiative extends only to laws which the legislature may enact under this constitution. The power of referendum does not extend to acts making appropriations for state institutions or to meet deficiencies in state funds and must be invoked in the manner prescribed by law within 90 days following the final adjournment of the legislative session at which the law was enacted. To invoke the initiative or referendum, petitions signed by a number of registered electors, not less than eight percent for initiative and five percent for referendum of the total vote cast for all candidates for governor at the last preceding general election at which a governor was elected shall be required.</blockquote>\n<p id=\"b607-7\">In deciding this case, the majority makes much of the fact that Act 381 allocates $1,000,000 \u201cto the department of state police . . . .\u201d <em>Ante </em>at 366. It concludes that the $1,000,000 is an \u201cappropriation\u201d and <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"422\">*422</page-number>that the Department of State Police is a \u201cstate institution.\u201d See <em>ante </em>at 366. Thus, it reasons, the power of referendum does not extend to Act 381. I disagree.</p>\n<p id=\"b608-5\">The majority\u2019s error, in my view, arises in part because it fails to examine carefully the meaning of the phrase \u201cacts making appropriations for state institutions.\u201d In particular, it ignores the use of the word \u201cfor\u201d in that phrase. In essence, it interprets art 2, \u00a7 9 to exempt from referendum any act that makes an appropriation \u201cto\u201d a state institution. This interpretation not only lacks support from the plain language of the article, it fails to appreciate the critical difference between the meanings of \u201cto\u201d<footnotemark>1</footnotemark> and \u201cfor.\u201d</p>\n<p id=\"b608-6\">I would interpret art 2, \u00a7 9 to give effect to the words contained in it. The provision indicates that an act making an appropriation is exempt from referendum only if the appropriation is made \u201cfor\u201d state institutions. The dictionary definition of \u201cfor,\u201d in pertinent part, is \u201csuiting the purposes or needs of,\u201d \u201cwith the object or purpose of.\u201d<footnotemark>2</footnotemark> \u201cPurpose\u201d is defined as \u201cthe reason for which something exists.\u201d<footnotemark>3</footnotemark> Thus, a reasonable interpretation of art 2, \u00a7 9 is that legislation that contains an appropriation aimed at satisfying the purpose or reason for which a state institution exists is referendum-proof. Unless the appropriation is intended to support the core function of a state institution, it does not prevent the people from voting on the legislation in referendum.</p>\n<p id=\"b609-4\"><page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"423\">*423</page-number>I would adopt this as the most reasonable interpretation of art 2, \u00a7 9.<footnotemark>4</footnotemark> Applying it to this case, I would conclude that Act 381 does not make an appropriation for a state institution.\u201d Of the $1,000,000 that it allocates to the Department of State Police not a penny serves the central function for which the department exists. Instead, the appropriation implements the specific substantive provisions of the act.<footnotemark>5</footnotemark> None of the items funded relates to a core function of the state police department.<footnotemark>6</footnotemark> Thus, giving the words of art 2, \u00a7 9 and of Act 381 their plain meaning, the Act does not make appropriations \u201cfor state institutions\u201d within the meaning of the constitution.<footnotemark>7</footnotemark></p>\n<p id=\"b609-5\">My interpretation is consistent with this Court\u2019s mandate that the right of referendum should be liberally construed. See, e.g., <em>Kuhn v Dep\u2019t of Treasury, </em>384 Mich 378, 385; 183 NW2d 796 (1971). Further<page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"424\">*424</page-number>more, it prevents the Legislature from easily circumventing the people\u2019s constitutional referendum power. With that end in mind, I agree with the views expressed by the Arizona Supreme Court in <em>Warner v Secretary of State:</em><footnotemark><em>8</em></footnotemark></p>\n<blockquote id=\"b610-6\">To hold that an act may not be referred because incidentally it provides the funds to accomplish the ends it seeks would have the effect of practically nullifying the referendum provision of the Constitution, because many of the measures passed carry appropriations of this character, and it would be an easy matter to include such a provision in others and bring about the same result.</blockquote>\n<p id=\"b610-7\">\u00dc. THE MAJORITY\u2019S UNPRECEDENTED INTERPRETATION OF ART 2, \u00a7 9: A DEPARTURE FROM DECISIONS IN THE \u201cGAS TAX\u201d CASES<footnotemark>9</footnotemark></p>\n<p id=\"b610-8\">The majority asserts that its conclusion, that Act 381 makes appropriations for state institutions, is consistent with \u201can unbroken line of decisions from this Court\u201d in the gas tax cases. See <em>ante </em>at 366. Upon close inspection, one finds the assertion untrue. Rather, as will be seen, it is my interpretation, and that of my two dissenting colleagues, that is consistent with the gas tax cases.</p>\n<p id=\"b610-9\">To be sure, the gas tax cases are \u201cunbroken\u201d in the sense that all constitute proclamations from this Court that the challenged gas tax was nonreferable, <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"425\">*425</page-number>meaning that it could not be subject to a referendum vote. Notwithstanding, they do not support the majority\u2019s conclusion.</p>\n<p id=\"b611-5\">In the earliest gas tax case, this Court stated that the appropriation exception in our constitution was intended to allow the state to exercise its various core functions free from financial embarrassment. See <em>Detroit Automobile Club v Secretary of State, </em>230 Mich 623, 625; 203 NW 529 (1925). We explained:</p>\n<blockquote id=\"b611-6\">It is clear that, <em>by permitting immediate effect to be given to appropriation acts for state institutions, it was their purpose to enable the state to exercise its various functions free from financial embarrassment. </em>The highway department exercises state functions. It was created by the Legislature for that purpose. It must have money to carry on its activities. <em>Without the money appropriated by this act for its immediate use, it would cease to function. The constitutional purpose was to prevent such a contingency. [Id. </em>at 625-626 (emphasis added).][<footnotemark>10</footnotemark>]</blockquote>\n<p id=\"b611-8\">This interpretation was reiterated in the second gas tax case. See <em>Moreton v Secretary of State, </em>240 Mich 584, 592; 216 NW 450 (1927). <em>Moreton </em>stated that an act that contained appropriations to enable state agencies \u201cto function\u201d was nonreferable. <em>Detroit Automobile Club </em>and <em>Moreton </em>contain the most thorough discussion of this Court\u2019s interpretation of the <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"426\">*426</page-number>appropriation exception to the referendum power.<footnotemark>11</footnotemark> These cases demonstrate that the appropriation exception within art 2, \u00a7 9, was prompted by a fear of financial embarrassment. That could occur if, by referendum petition, an appropriation for a state institution were suspended pending a vote on a legislative act. See <em>Moreton, supra </em>at 592; <em>Detroit Automobile Club, supra </em>at 625.</p>\n<p id=\"b612-4\">The majority\u2019s interpretation of art 2, \u00a7 9, impliedly rejects this Court\u2019s \u201ccore function\u201d interpretation of the phrase in our constitution exempting from referendum \u201cacts making appropriations for state institutions.\u201d<footnotemark>12</footnotemark> Therefore, its decision is not consistent with our prior decisions, at all. In fact, it seriously departs from them.</p>\n<p id=\"b612-5\">Given that <em>Detroit Automobile Club </em>represents the only substantive interpretation by this Court of \u201cacts making appropriations for state institutions,\u201d I agree with Justice Weaver that we should follow it. Doing so further supports the conclusion I have articulated: art 2, \u00a7 9 was intended to exempt from referendum only those acts containing grants that ensure the viability of state agency recipients, or as the Court of Appeals said, that support the agencies\u2019 \u201ccore functions.\u201d 246 Mich App 82; 630 NW2d 376 (2001).</p>\n<p id=\"b613-4\"><page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"427\">*427</page-number>This interpretation renders the referendum exception consistent with the fundamental purpose of the general power of referendum. If the appropriation provision in an act is essential to a core purpose of a state institution, the act may not be referred. The risk is too great that the delay caused by a referendum vote would embarrass government and be detrimental to the public. On the other hand, where the appropriation provision is for a lesser function, not essential to the purpose of the department, the embarrassment problem does not arise. In the latter case, the people\u2019s right to decide policy issues for themselves, which is the core purpose for which the people reserved the referendum power, should survive.</p>\n<p id=\"b613-5\">m. COURT CONSIDERATION OF THE LEGISLATURE\u2019S motives</p>\n<p id=\"b613-6\">In one of the three concurring opinions joining the majority, my colleague \u201cemphasize[s]\u201d that the Legislature\u2019s subjective motivation for making a $1,000,000 appropriation in Act 381 \u201cis irrelevant.\u201d Chief Justice Corrigan\u2019s opinion at 367. In my view, this is an unfortunate exaggeration.</p>\n<p id=\"b613-7\">I acknowledge that, as a general rule, courts do not inquire into the motives of the Legislature in passing legislation. See <em>Young v Ann Arbor, </em>267 Mich 241, 243; 255 NW 579 (1934). However, \u201c[c]ourts are not supposed to be blinded bats.\u201d <em>Todd v Hull, </em>288 Mich 521, 543; 285 NW 46 (1939) (opinion of Bushnell, J.), quoting <em>State ex rel Pollock v Becker, </em>289 Mo 660, 684; 233 SW 641, 646 (1921) (Graves, J., concurring).<footnotemark>13</footnotemark> <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"428\">*428</page-number>Hence, I would not be so quick to eliminate categorically the possibility that this Court may consider, where pertinent, relevant, and ascertainable, the Legislature\u2019s motives in enacting a statute.</p>\n<p id=\"b614-4\">IV. REFERENDUM v INITIATIVE</p>\n<p id=\"b614-5\">I find objectionable, also, the palliation offered by two of my colleagues in the majority that the intervening defendant retains the direct remedy of the initiative process. Chief Justice Corrigan\u2019s opinion at 366-367; Justice Young\u2019s opinion at 389. Although I agree that the initiative process is available here, I find their observation misplaced.</p>\n<p id=\"b614-6\">First, any alternative remedy that exists is irrelevant to the issue before us: whether Act 381 constitutes an act \u201cmaking appropriations for state institutions\u201d within the meaning of art 2, \u00a7 9. Moreover, there are real and heightened practical difficulties associated with pursuing an initiative process, as compared with referendum. Not only does the initiative process require far more petition signatures than the referendum process, it also involves much more complicated procedures. Const 1963, art 2, \u00a7 9.</p>\n<p id=\"b614-7\">Also, this case presents the exact situation for which the referendum power was created. The power exists to permit citizens to suspend or annul laws passed by the Legislature until the people can vote on the merits of the law. See <em>Alabama Freight v Hunt, </em>29 Ariz 419, 424; 242 P2d 658 (1926); see also Const 1963, art 2, \u00a7 9. Thus, if Act 381 is referable, it would not become effective until the people voted it should be the law of this state. Const 1963, art 2, \u00a7 9.</p>\n<p id=\"b615-4\"><page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"429\">*429</page-number>The power of initiative, on the other hand, is intended to protect against a Legislature that fails to act.<footnotemark>14</footnotemark> It does not suspend the effective date of a law passed by the Legislature. Const 1963, art 2, \u00a7 9. Therefore, even if a successful initiative drive were pursued, the people would not vote on the law until at least November 2002. By then, Act 381 would have been operative for over sixteen months and potentially thousands of additional concealed weapons would be carried by thousands more Michiganians. Thus, from intervening defendant\u2019s perspective, the availability of the initiative process is an unsatisfactory remedy.<footnotemark>15</footnotemark></p>\n<p id=\"b615-5\">V. CONCLUSION</p>\n<p id=\"b615-6\">For these reasons, and for the reasons given by my two dissenting colleagues, I believe that Act 381 does not constitute \u201cacts making appropriations for state institutions\u201d within the meaning of art 2, \u00a7 9. Accordingly, I would affirm the decision of the Court of Appeals.</p>\n<footnote label=\"1\">\n<p id=\"b608-7\"> \u201cTo\u201d is defined, inter alia, as \u201cused for expressing destination or appointed end.\u201d <em>Random House Webster\u2019s College Dictionary, </em>p 1401 (1995).</p>\n</footnote>\n<footnote label=\"2\">\n<p id=\"b608-8\"> <em>Id. </em>at 519.

My response is that no wording change is needed. Art 2, \u00a7 9 means what it says. However, it would have to be reworded to accurately convey the meaning that Justice Markman and the majority give it. It would have to be changed to read: The power of referendum \u201cdoes not extend to acts making appropriations <em>to </em>state institutions . . . .\u201d</p>\n</footnote>\n<footnote label=\"5\">\n<p id=\"b609-8\"> Act 381 directs that the $1,000,000 be used, inter alia, to distribute trigger locks, provide permit application kits, take photographs of applicants, conduct a public safety campaign regarding Act 381\u2019s requirements, and conduct fingerprint analysis and comparison reports required under the Act.</p>\n</footnote>\n<footnote label=\"6\">\n<p id=\"b609-9\"> Although Justice Young opines that the judiciary is ill-equipped to resolve what a state institution\u2019s \u201ccore function\u201d is, see <em>ante </em>at 390,1 have every confidence in the judiciary\u2019s capabilities in this regard.</p>\n</footnote>\n<footnote label=\"7\">\n<p id=\"b609-10\"> Justice Markman creates a hypothetical example whereby the Legislature enacts a law that assigns to the Department of State Police responsibilities belonging to the Department of Corrections, and then allocates money to that end. See Justice Markman\u2019s opinion at 401-402. I find his hypothetical example inapplicable. Act 381 does not transfer functions belonging to any other agency.</p>\n</footnote>\n<footnote label=\"8\">\n<p id=\"b610-10\"> 39 Ariz 203, 215-216; 4 P2d 1000 (1931).</p>\n</footnote>\n<footnote label=\"9\">\n<p id=\"b610-11\"> <em>Detroit Automobile Club v Secretary of State, </em>230 Mich 623; 203 NW 529 (1925); <em>Moreton v Secretary of State, </em>240 Mich 584, 592; 216 NW 450 (1927); <em>Good Rds Federation v State Bd of Canvassers, </em>333 Mich 352, 360; 53 NW2d 481 (1952); <em>Bds of Co Rd Comm\u2019rs v Bd of State Canvassers, </em>391 Mich 666; 218 NW2d 144 (1974); <em>Co Rd Ass\u2019n of Michigan v Bd of State Canvassers, </em>407 Mich 101, 116-118; 282 NW2d 774 (1979).</p>\n</footnote>\n<footnote label=\"10\">\n<p id=\"b611-9\"> In <em>Detroit Automobile Club, </em>the issue was whether 1925 PA 1 was subject to referendum under Const 1908, Art 5, \u00a7 1, amendment of 1913 (the predecessor to Const 1963, art 2, \u00a7 9), i.e., whether it made an appropriation \u201cfor [a] state institution]].\u201d In his concurring opinion in this case, Justice Markman accurately notes that the portion of <em>Detroit Automobile Club </em>quoted above is taken from this Court\u2019s discussion regarding the meaning of the term \u201cstate institution.\u201d Nevertheless, it is clear that that discussion contained, also, an interpretation of the entire referendum exception provision. For this reason, I find the Court\u2019s discussion in <em>Detroit Automobile Club </em>useful here.</p>\n</footnote>\n<footnote label=\"11\">\n<p id=\"b612-6\"> In two of the three later gas tax cases, this Court merely quoted or cited, then followed, our interpretation in <em>Detroit Automobile Club </em>of the appropriation exception to the power of referendum.
