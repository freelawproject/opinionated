The trial court found defendant guilty of both offenses, and the Court of Appeals affirmed.</p>\n<p id=\"b411-11\">We originally granted leave to consider whether the lower courts properly determined that it was defendant\u2019s burden to establish his diminished capacity defense by a preponderance of the evidence under <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"226\">*226</page-number>MCL 768.21a. However, we are now persuaded by the prosecution\u2019s argument that, by enacting a comprehensive statutory scheme setting forth the requirements for and the effects of asserting a defense based on either mental illness or mental retardation, the Legislature has signified its intent not to allow a defendant to introduce evidence of mental abnormalities short of legal insanity to avoid or reduce criminal responsibility by negating specific intent.<footnotemark>1</footnotemark> Therefore, we affirm the decision of the Court of Appeals on that basis.</p>\n<p id=\"b412-5\">I. FACTUAL AND PROCEDURAL BACKGROUND</p>\n<p id=\"b412-6\">The events giving rise to defendant\u2019s convictions took place in the early morning of July 9, 1995. After attending a dance at a local community hall, complainants Audrey Thomas and Aron Blakely returned to Thomas\u2019 home in Saginaw at approximately 2:00 A.M.<footnotemark>2</footnotemark></p>\n<p id=\"b412-7\">Thomas and Blakely were sitting in the family room when Thomas heard the doorbell ring. Thomas discovered that defendant was at the door. Defendant demanded to be let in, yelling that Blakely should \u201ccome on out\u201d and that Thomas was his \u201cwoman.\u201d When Thomas refused to admit him, defendant eventually crashed through a window. Defendant produced a handgun and fired two shots in the general direction of Thomas and Blakely. Neither was hit. Blakely then announced that he was leaving. As <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"227\">*227</page-number>defendant opened the door for him, defendant struck Blakely in the face with his fist. Although defendant initially walked out the front door with Blakely, he immediately returned to the house where he confronted Thomas, striking her head with the butt of his gun. The blow apparently caused the gun to discharge a third time. Blakely heard the shot and went next door to call the police.</p>\n<p id=\"b413-5\">Defendant eventually fled the scene and drove to his nearby home. He immediately called Thomas and threatened her. Several police officers arrived at defendant\u2019s home a short time later. A stand-off ensued, during which defendant threatened to shoot himself and any officers who attempted to enter the house. Saginaw Police Sergeant Tern Johnson-Wise established telephone contact with defendant and spoke with him several times. She testified that defendant was yelling and screaming initially, and that when he calmed down he began talking about demons and \u201cmoney that was stolen from him.\u201d</p>\n<p id=\"b413-6\">At some point, defendant asked for some heart medication that was in his truck. Saginaw Police Officer Daniel Kuhn lured him to a window by offering to give defendant his medication. When Officer Kuhn tried to grab defendant through the open window, defendant got free and slammed the window on Officer Kuhn\u2019s fingers. Defendant eventually allowed the officers to enter and he was placed under arrest. He was subsequently charged with first-degree home invasion, MCL 750.110a(2), two counts of assault with intent to commit murder, MCL 750.83, being a felon in possession of a firearm, MCL 750.224f, possession of a firearm during the commission of a felony, MCL <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"228\">*228</page-number>750.227b, and resisting and obstructing a police officer, MCL 750.479.</p>\n<p id=\"b414-4\">At his bench trial, defendant presented a diminished capacity defense. In addition to several lay witnesses that testified that he had been drinking before the incident and that he appeared intoxicated, defendant presented a report from Kingswood Hospital, where he had been treated approximately a month after the incident. The report described him as being \u201cdelusional\u201d and indicated that he suffered from organic brain damage. The report further described his conduct upon admission to the hospital:</p>\n<blockquote id=\"b414-5\">He stated that his son had been killed in April 1995 and \u201cthey had broken into my computer.\u201d He says that he has special forces that are guarding him; that people are stealing money from his son\u2019s records. He also hears voices telling him that people are looking and laughing at him. . . . He is afraid that someone is trying to poison him. He talks of the organization that is manipulating him and that someone has put \u201cvoodoo dolls\u201d on him.</blockquote>\n<p id=\"b414-7\">Defendant also presented expert testimony from Dr. Michael Abramsky, a board-certified clinical and forensic psychologist. Dr. Abramsky testified that defendant\u2019s bizarre behavior at the time of the shooting and ensuing stand-off \u201csuggests that he was mentally ill at the time\u201d and that defendant\u2019s drug-induced organic brain damage,<footnotemark>3</footnotemark> combined with his ingestion of alcohol and various prescription drugs, was the likely cause not only of his behavior but his claimed loss of memory of the incident. In sum, Dr. Abramsky believed that defendant suffered from diminished <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"229\">*229</page-number>capacity and that he therefore could not formulate a specific intent.</p>\n<p id=\"b415-4\">In rebuttal, the prosecution presented the testimony of Dr. George Watson of the Center for Forensic Psychiatry. Although he acknowledged defendant\u2019s apparent organic brain damage, Dr. Watson .did not believe defendant to be obviously and acutely psychotic. Instead, on the basis of his clinical interview, Dr. Watson believed \u201cthat the possibility of Mr. Carpenter exaggerating appeared to be more likely</p>\n<p id=\"b415-5\">In a comprehensive written opinion, the trial court issued its findings. The court found defendant guilty of resisting and obstructing a police officer and being a felon in possession of a firearm. Regarding the two counts of assault with intent to commit murder, the court found that the prosecution had failed to prove that defendant intended to kill either victim. Instead, the court found that the evidence only supported a finding of guilt on the lesser offense of felonious assault. Finally, the trial court found defendant guilty as charged of both first-degree home invasion and possession of a firearm during the commission of . a felony.</p>\n<p id=\"b415-6\">The court proceeded to address and reject defendant\u2019s diminished capacity defense:</p>\n<blockquote id=\"b415-7\">The [c]ourt does not find that the defendant has supported his burden of proof of diminished capacity by a preponderance of the evidence: His actions seem very' \u201cgoal oriented\u201d .... His actions in driving to Ms. Thomas\u2019s home, his ringing the door bell, the epitaphs [sic] of displeasure, his entry into Ms. Thomas\u2019s home, his aiming the gun, his shots into the ceiling and near the ceiling scaring the victims, his striking Mr. Blakely and Ms. Thomas, his departure from the home, and significantly, his threatening phone <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"230\">*230</page-number>call back to [Ms.] Thomas, all suggest very goal oriented actions consistent with the capacity to form a specific intent.</blockquote>\n<p id=\"b416-5\">The trial court eventually sentenced defendant to the fo\u00fcowing prison terms: twenty-eight months to twenty years for the home invasion conviction, twenty-eight months to four years for each of the felonious assault convictions, twenty-eight months to five years for the felon-in-possession conviction, and one to two years for the resisting and obstructing conviction. The court further ordered that these sentences be served consecutive to the mandatory two-year term for the felony-firearm conviction.</p>\n<p id=\"b416-6\">In affirming defendant\u2019s convictions and sentences, the Court of Appeals rejected defendant\u2019s argument that the trial court erred in shifting the burden to defendant to prove his claim of diminished capacity by a preponderance of the evidence.<footnotemark>4</footnotemark></p>\n<p id=\"b416-7\">This Court granted defendant\u2019s application for leave to appeal. 462 Mich 912 (2000).</p>\n<p id=\"b416-8\">H. STANDARD OF REVIEW</p>\n<p id=\"b416-9\">The proper application of MCL 768.21a is a question of law subject to de novo review. <em>People v Rodriguez, </em>463 Mich 466, 471; 620 NW2d 13 (2000).</p>\n<p id=\"b416-10\">m. THE TRADITIONAL INSANITY DEFENSE</p>\n<p id=\"b416-11\">In Michigan, use of the insanity defense has been governed by statute since 1975. 1975 PA 180. Legal insanity is an affirmative defense requiring proof that, <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"231\">*231</page-number>as a result of mental illness or being mentally retarded as defined in the mental health code, the defendant lacked \u201csubstantial capacity either to appreciate the nature and quality or the wrongfulness of his or her conduct or conform his or her conduct to the requirements of the law.\u201d MCL 768.21a(l).<footnotemark>5</footnotemark> Importantly, the statute provides that \u201c[t]he <em>defendant </em>has the burden of proving the defense of insanity by a preponderance of the evidence.\u201d MCL 768.21a(3) (emphasis added).</p>\n<p id=\"b417-5\">There are also several procedural requirements that must be satisfied before an insanity defense may be raised. We recently summarized those requirements in <em>People v Toma, </em>462 Mich 281, 292, n 6; 613 NW2d 694 (2000):</p>\n<blockquote id=\"b417-6\">A defendant in a felony case who wishes to interpose an insanity defense, must serve written notice on the court and the prosecutor not less than thirty days before trial and submit to a court-ordered examination, relating to the claim of insanity, by personnel for the center for forensic psychiatry or other qualified personnel. MCL 768.20a(l) and (2); MSA 28.1043(1)(1) and (2). A defendant or the prosecutor may also obtain independent psychiatric examinations. MCL 768.20a(3); MSA 28.1043(1)(3). The failure by the defendant to fully cooperate in either the court-directed or independent examinations, bars the defendant from presenting testimony relating to insanity at trial. MCL 768.20a(4); MSA 28.1043(1)(4).</blockquote>\n<p id=\"b417-7\">Finally, MCL 768.36 sets forth the consequences of a jury\u2019s finding that a defendant is guilty of an offense <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"232\">*232</page-number>and that, although the defendant was mentally ill at the time the offense charged was committed, the defendant was <em>not </em>legally insane. If a defendant is found \u201cguilty but mentally ill,\u201d the trial court \u201cshall impose any sentence which could be imposed pursuant to law upon a defendant who is convicted of the same offense.\u201d MCL 768.36(3). If incarcerated, the defendant must \u201cundergo further evaluation and be given such treatment as is psychiatrically indicated for his mental illness or retardation.\u201d <em>Id. </em>If the defendant is placed on probation, \u201cthe trial judge, upon recommendation of the center for forensic psychiatry, shall make treatment a condition of probation.\u201d MCL 768.36(4).</p>\n<p id=\"b418-5\">IV. THE \u201cDIMINISHED CAPACITY\u201d DEFENSE</p>\n<p id=\"b418-6\">As defined by our Court of Appeals, the so-called \u201cdiminished capacity\u201d defense allows a defendant, even though legally sane, to offer evidence of some mental abnormality to negate the specific intent required to commit a particular crime. See, e.g., <em>People v Jones, </em>151 Mich App 1, 5-6; 390 NW2d 189 (1986). \u201c[T]he theory is that if because of mental disease or defect a defendant cannot form the specific state of mind required as an essential element of a crime, he may be convicted only of a lower grade of the offense not requiring that particular mental element.\u201d <em>Chestnut v State, </em>538 So 2d 820, 822 (Fla, 1989) (citation omitted).</p>\n<p id=\"b418-7\">This Court has several times acknowledged in passing the concept of the diminished capacity defense. See, e.g., <em>People v Lloyd, </em>459 Mich 433; 590 NW2d 738 (1999) (holding that defense counsel was not constitutionally ineffective for presenting a diminished ca<page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"233\">*233</page-number>pacity defense as opposed to a defense of legal insanity); <em>People v Pickens, </em>446 Mich 298; 521 NW2d 797 (1994) (holding that the defendant was not prejudiced by counsel\u2019s failure to pursue a diminished capacity defense); <em>People v Griffin, </em>433 Mich 860; 444 NW2d 139 (1989) (remanding for a hearing on the defendant\u2019s claim that trial counsel was ineffective for failing to explore defenses of diminished capacity and insanity). However, we have never specifically authorized its use in Michigan courts.</p>\n<p id=\"b419-5\">Instead, it was our Court of Appeals, in <em>People v Lynch, </em>47 Mich App 8; 208 NW2d 656 (1973), that introduced to Michigan the diminished capacity defense. The defendant in <em>Lynch </em>was charged with having murdered her baby by starvation. As part of her defense, the defendant sought to have admitted into evidence testimony from two psychiatrists supporting her claim that she did not possess the requisite intent to be convicted of first-degree murder, MCL 750.316. The trial court refused to admit the evidence on the ground that the defendant had never raised an insanity defense and did not give the required statutory notice.<footnotemark>6</footnotemark></p>\n<p id=\"b419-6\">In reversing the defendant\u2019s jury conviction, the Court of Appeals rejected the prosecution\u2019s argument that allowing evidence of mental illness less than insanity as bearing on the defendant\u2019s capacity to form the intent required to commit a particular crime would \u201csanction a subterfuge\u201d avoiding the standards of the insanity defense enunciated by this Court in <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"234\">*234</page-number><em>People v Durfee, </em>62 Mich 487; 29 NW 109 (1886).<footnotemark>7</footnotemark> The Court also disagreed that recognizing a diminished capacity defense separate from legal insanity \u201cwould permit the defense to in effect sneak in the insanity defense without labeling it as such and without the necessity of complying with the notice statute as to the insanity defense.\u201d <em>Lynch, supra </em>at 20. While it acknowledged that some states viewed mental capacity as \u201can all or nothing matter and that only insanity . . . negates criminal intent,\u201d the Court of Appeals concluded that proof of diminished capacity is admissible as \u201cbearing on intent generally or at least on those special states of mind where a specific intent is required or whether the state of mind by definition determines the degree of offense as here.\u201d <em>Id.</em></p>\n<p id=\"b420-6\">In <em>People v Mangiapane, </em>85 Mich App 379; 271 NW2d 240 (1978), the Court of Appeals had occasion to address the diminished capacity concept under the current statutory framework established by 1975 PA 180. In <em>Mangiapane, </em>the defendant sought to introduce psychiatric testimony on the issue of his capac<page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"235\">*235</page-number>ity to form the specific intent to commit assault with intent to commit murder in violation of MCL 750.83. The trial court denied the request on the ground that the defendant did not raise the defense and give the prosecution notice under MCL 768.20a.</p>\n<p id=\"b421-5\">The Court of Appeals affirmed, explaining that, by enacting 1975 PA \u00cd80, the Legislature intended \u201cto bring under one procedural blanket all defenses to criminal charges that rest upon legal insanity as defined in the statute,\u201d and that \u201cthe defense known as diminished capacity comes within th[e] codified definition of legal insanity.\u201d <em>Id. </em>at 394-395. Thus, the Court held that, in order to introduce evidence that, although not legally insane, the defendant lacked mental capacity to form specific intent, the defendant had to fully comply with the statutory insanity defense provisions. <em>Id. </em>at 395-396.</p>\n<p id=\"b421-6\">The Court of Appeals decision in <em>Mangiapane </em>was then followed by a series of decisions continuing to address diminished capacity defense as a form of the statutory insanity defense. See, e.g., <em>People v Denton, </em>138 Mich App 568; 360 NW2d 245 (1984); <em>People v Anderson, </em>166 Mich App 455; 421 NW2d 200 (1988).</p>\n<p id=\"b421-7\">Consistent with this line of cases, the Court of Appeals held that a defendant seeking to present a diminished capacity defense bears the burden of establishing such a defense by a preponderance of the evidence under MCL 768.21a(3), which took effect on October 1, 1994. Defendant challenges that holding, arguing that nothing in the language of \u00a7 21a suggests a legislative intent to place on defendants the burden of proving diminished capacity.</p>\n<p id=\"b421-8\">We agree with defendant that there is no indication in \u00a7 21a that the Legislature intended to make dimin<page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"236\">*236</page-number>ished capacity an affirmative defense. However, that is only because, as explained below, the Legislature\u2019s enactment of a comprehensive statutory scheme concerning defenses based on either mental illness or mental retardation demonstrates the Legislature\u2019s intent to preclude the use of <em>any </em>evidence of a defendant\u2019s lack of mental capacity short of legal insanity to avoid or reduce criminal responsibility by negating specific intent.</p>\n<p id=\"b422-6\">V. THE CONTINUED VIABILITY OF THE DIMINISHED CAPACITY DEFENSE IN MICHIGAN</p>\n<p id=\"b422-7\">Since its inception in the United States, the diminished capacity defense has been the subject of much debate.<footnotemark>8</footnotemark> At present, there is a wide divergence of views among the states concerning the admissibility of evidence of mental illness short of insanity. See, generally, 1 Robinson, Criminal Law Defenses, \u00a7 64(a), pp 272-279. A common criticism is that the subtle gradations of mental illness recognized in the psychiatric field are of little utility in determining criminal responsibility:</p>\n<blockquote id=\"b422-8\">\u201c[T]o the psychiatrist mental cases are a series of imperceptible gradations from the mild psychopath to the extreme psychotic, whereas criminal law allows for no gradations. It requires a final decisive moral judgment of the <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"237\">*237</page-number>culpability of the accused. For the purposes of conviction there is no twilight zone between abnormality and insanity. An offender is wholly sane or wholly insane.\u201d <em>[State v </em>Bouwman, 328 NW2d 703, 706 (Minn, 1982) (citations omitted).]</blockquote>\n<p id=\"b423-5\">In <em>State v Wilcox, </em>70 Ohio St 2d 182, 192-193; 436 NE2d 523 (1982), the court expressed a similar view:</p>\n<blockquote id=\"b423-6\">Theoretically the insanity concept operates as a bright line test separating the criminally responsible from the criminally irresponsible. The diminished capacity concept on the other hand posits a series of rather blurry lines representing gradations of culpability.</blockquote>\n<p id=\"b423-7\">We need not join the affray because we agree with the prosecution that our Legislature, by enacting the comprehensive statutory framework described above, has already conclusively determined when mental incapacity can serve as a basis for relieving one from criminal responsibility. We conclude that, through this framework, the Legislature has created an all or nothing insanity defense. Central to our holding is the fact that the Legislature has already contemplated and addressed situations involving persons who are mentally ill or retarded yet not legally insane. As noted above, such a person may be found \u201cguilty but mentally ill\u201d and must be sentenced in the same manner as any other defendant committing the same offense and subject to psychiatric evaluation and treatment. MCL 768.36(3). Through this statutory provision, the Legislature has demonstrated its policy choice that evidence of mental incapacity short of insanity cannot be used to avoid or reduce criminal responsibility by negating specific intent.</p>\n<p id=\"b424-5\"><page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"238\">*238</page-number>As a final matter, we note that even persons <em>acquitted </em>of an offense by reason of insanity may be confined and required to undergo evaluation and treatment. MCL 330.2050. As we explained in <em>People v Webb, </em>458 Mich 265, 281; 580 NW2d 884 (1998), MCL 330.2050 is \u201ca measure to promote public safety. Persons acquitted by reason of insanity, particularly where the facts are grave, cannot be allowed simply to walk out the front door of the courthouse. The statute is clearly designed to establish a procedure by which it can be determined whether the person can safely reenter society.\u201d We agree with the Supreme Court of Wisconsin that</p>\n<blockquote id=\"b424-6\">[w]here . . . the statutes provide that a person found not guilty by reason of insanity is to be committed to a mental treatment facility until recovered and until his return to society presents no danger to the public, the introduction of evidence of mental condition on the question of impaired capacity to form intent during the guilt phase of the trial could well be required to acquit the defendant, sane or insane, without ever inquiring into the issue of sanity and without regard to the provisions of the statute requiring treatment of those pleading and establishing insanity. <em>[Steele v State, </em>97 Wis 2d 72, 91; 294 NW2d 2 (1980) (citation omitted).]</blockquote>\n<p id=\"b424-7\">Similar sentiments were expressed in <em>Bethea v United States, </em>365 A2d 64, 90-91 (DC App, 1976), a decision that is widely cited for the view that the diminished capacity defense should be rejected:</p>\n<blockquote id=\"b424-8\">Under the present statutory scheme, a successful plea of insanity avoids a conviction, but confronts the accused with the very real possibility of prolonged therapeutic confinement. If, however, psychiatric testimony were generally admissible to cast a reasonable doubt upon whatever degree of mens rea was necessary for the charged offense, <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"239\">*239</page-number>thus resulting in outright acquittal, there would be scant reason indeed for a defendant to risk such confinement by arguing the greater form of mental deficiency. Thus, quite apart from the argument that the diminished capacity doctrine would result in a considerably greater likelihood of acquittal for those who by traditional standards would be held responsible, the future safety of the offender as well as the community would be jeopardized by the possibility that one who is genuinely dangerous might obtain his complete freedom merely by applying his psychiatric evidence to the threshold issue of intent.</blockquote>\n<p id=\"b425-5\">Like the Supreme Court of Ohio, we decline to adopt an alternative defense to legal insanity \u201cthat could swallow up the insanity defense and its attendant commitment provisions.\u201d <em>Wilcox, supra </em>at 189. \u201c[T]he concepts of both diminished capacity and insanity involve a moral choice by the community to withhold a finding of responsibility and its consequence of punishment.\u201d <em>Bethea, supra </em>at 90, n 55.<footnotemark>9</footnotemark> Accordingly, we hold that the insanity defense as established by the Legislature is the sole standard for determining criminal responsibility as it relates to mental illness or retardation.<footnotemark>10</footnotemark></p>\n<p id=\"b426-3\"><page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"240\">*240</page-number>Defendant, however, maintains that it would violate due process to preclude a defendant from introducing evidence that, although not legally insane, he lacked the mental capacity to form a specific intent. The United States Supreme Court\u2019s decision in <em>Fisher v United States, </em>328 US 463; 66 S Ct 1318; 90 L Ed 1382 (1946), dispositively answers this contention in the negative. The defendant in <em>Fisher </em>sought an instruction in his District of Columbia murder trial that would have permitted the jury \u201cto weigh evidence of his mental deficiencies, which were short of insanity in the legal sense, in determining the fact of and the accused\u2019s capacity for premeditation and deliberation.\u201d <em>Id. </em>at 470. In upholding the refusal of the trial court to give such an instruction, the Supreme Court noted that \u201c[f]or this Court to force the District of Columbia to adopt such a requirement for criminal trials would involve a fundamental change in the common law theory of responsibility.\u201d <em>Id. </em>at 476. The Court concluded that</p>\n<blockquote id=\"b426-4\">[s]uch a radical departure from common law concepts is more properly a subject for the exercise of legislative power or at least for the discretion of the courts of the District. The administration of criminal law in matters not affected by Constitutional limitations or a general federal law is a matter peculiarly of local concern. <em>[Id. </em>at 476.]</blockquote>\n<p id=\"b426-5\">Given the clear message of the Court\u2019s decision in <em>Fisher, </em>the reliance by both defendant and the dissent on other United States Supreme Court decisions not <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"241\">*241</page-number>addressing the issue presented here is not persuasive. Indeed, the Seventh Circuit Court of Appeals relied on <em>Fisher </em>to reach the same decision we do today: \u201c[A] state is not constitutionally compelled to recognize the doctrine of diminished capacity and hence a state may exclude expert testimony offered for the purpose of establishing that a criminal defendant lacked the capacity to form a specific intent.\u201d <em>Muench v Israel, </em>715 F2d 1124, 1144-1145 (CA 7, 1982); see also <em>Mott, supra </em>at 541 <em>(\u201cFisher </em>stands for the proposition that state legislatures, without violating the constitution, may preclude defendants from offering evidence of mental and psychological deficiencies to challenge the elements of a crime\u201d).</p>\n<p id=\"b427-4\">VI. CONCLUSION</p>\n<p id=\"b427-5\">The Legislature has enacted a comprehensive statutory scheme setting forth the requirements for and the effects of asserting a defense based on either mental illness or mental retardation. We conclude that, in so doing, the Legislature has signified its intent not to allow evidence of a defendant\u2019s lack of mental capacity short of legal insanity to avoid or reduce criminal responsibility by negating specific intent.

Thus, I respectfully dissent.<footnotemark>1</footnotemark></p>\n<p id=\"b428-6\">I. DUE PROCESS RIGHTS</p>\n<p id=\"b428-7\">The state may not deprive any person \u201cof life, liberty, or property, without due process of law . . . .\u201d US Const, Am XIV; Const 1963, Art 1, \u00a7 17. Although an accused has no absolute right to present evidence relevant to his defense, a limitation on his ability to present a defense may, under some circumstances, violate due process. See <em>Rock v Arkansas, </em>483 US 44, 55; 107 S Ct 2704; 97 L Ed 2d 37 (1987); <em>Chambers v Mississippi, </em>410 US 284, 294; 93 S Ct 1038; 35 L Ed 2d 297 (1973). Rules excluding evidence contravene the due process right to present a defense when they <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"243\">*243</page-number>infringe a weighty interest of an accused or significantly undermine a fundamental element of the defense. See <em>United States v Scheffer, </em>523 US 303, 308; 118 S Ct 1261; 140 L Ed 2d 413 (1998), citing <em>Rock, supra </em>at 58; <em>Chambers, supra </em>at 302.</p>\n<p id=\"b429-4\">Several United States Supreme Court cases have addressed an accused\u2019s right to present evidence in support of his defense. In <em>Chambers,</em><footnotemark><em>2</em></footnotemark><em> </em>the Supreme Court held that Mississippi\u2019s evidentiary rules deprived the defendant of a fair trial. They prevented him from calling witnesses who would have testified that another witness made trustworthy, inculpatory statements on the night of the crime. The Court reasoned that \u201cwhere constitutional rights directly affecting the ascertainment of guilt are implicated, the hearsay rule may not be applied mechanically to defeat the ends of justice.\u201d <em>Id. </em>at 302.</p>\n<p id=\"b429-5\">In <em>Washington v Texas,</em><footnotemark><em>3</em></footnotemark><em> </em>the trial court denied the defendant\u2019s request to have a defense witness testify. The court relied on Texas statutes providing that persons charged or convicted as coparticipants in the same crime could testify for the state but not for one another. Defendant sought to call a witness who would have offered relevant and material evidence for the defense. The Supreme Court held that the categorical exclusion of the witness was an unconstitutional and arbitrary denial of the defendant\u2019s rights. <em>Id. </em>at 23.</p>\n<p id=\"b429-6\">Later, in <em>Crane v </em>Kentucky,<footnotemark>4</footnotemark> the Supreme Court held that the defendant\u2019s right to have a fair opportu<page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"244\">*244</page-number>nity to present a defense was violated by the trial court\u2019s blanket exclusion of evidence. The Court found that the evidence was competent and reliable, that it bore on the reliability of a confession, and that it was central to the defendant\u2019s claim of innocence.</p>\n<p id=\"b430-5\">The common thread of <em>Chambers, Washington, </em>and <em>Crane </em>is the due process requirement that an accused be permitted a fair opportunity to defend against any and all state accusations. A fair opportunity to defend, if meaningful, must entail adversarial testing of the state\u2019s case against the accused. It must mean that the state may not prevent an accused from raising an effective defense. The state may not impede a defendant\u2019s right to put on a defense by imposing either mechanical or arbitrary rules of evidence. See <em>Montana v Egelhoff, </em>518 US 37, 63-64; 116 S Ct 2013; 135 L Ed 2d 361 (1996) (O\u2019Connor, J., dissenting, joined by Stevens, Souter, and Breyer, JJ.).</p>\n<p id=\"b430-6\">Today, the majority creates a rule per se prohibiting an accused from introducing evidence that, because of mental abnormality or illness, he lacked the specific intent to commit the crime. Under my view of controlling United States Supreme Court authority, this exclusion denies an accused his due process right to present a defense.</p>\n<p id=\"b430-7\">Although, as noted, the right is not entirely limitless, an essential component of procedural fairness is an opportunity to be heard. That opportunity becomes an empty one when the state is permitted to exclude competent, reliable evidence directly affecting the ascertainment of guilt. See <em>Crane, supra </em>at 690 (citations omitted); see also <em>Chambers, supra </em>at 302; <em>State v Ellis, </em>136 Wash 2d 498, 527; 963 P2d 843 (1998); <em>United States v Pohlot, </em>827 F2d 889, 900-901 <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"245\">*245</page-number>(CA 3, 1987). Hence, by foreclosing challenges to the state\u2019s proof concerning an essential element of the crime charged, the majority\u2019s broad rule impermissi-bly undermines a fundamental element of an accused\u2019s defense. It denies defendants with mental abnormalities their due process right to present a defense.</p>\n<p id=\"b431-5\">Moreover, the majority has impermissibly diminished the constitutional requirement of prosecutorial proof of guilt beyond a reasonable doubt on each element of the charged offense. The United States Supreme Court held in <em>In re Winship,</em><footnotemark><em>5</em></footnotemark><em> </em>that due process protects an accused against conviction except upon proof beyond a reasonable doubt of every element of the charged criminal offense. Where a certain mental state is an element of the crime, the government must allege and prove that mental state. See <em>Morissette v United States, </em>342 US 246, 275; 72 S Ct 240; 96 L Ed 288 (1952).</p>\n<p id=\"b431-6\">The case of <em>Martin v Ohio,</em><footnotemark><em>6</em></footnotemark><em> </em>is instructive. There, the United States Supreme Court considered an Ohio statute that placed on a defendant the burden of proving by a preponderance of the evidence an affirmative defense like self-defense. The Court held that the statute did not violate due process; however, it noted, it would have been error to instruct the jury that \u201cself-defense evidence could not be considered in determining whether there was a reasonable doubt about the state\u2019s case\u201d where Ohio\u2019s definition of the intent element made self-defense evidence the state\u2019s burden. <em>Id. </em>at 233-234. Such an instruction would have <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"246\">*246</page-number>been improper because it would have relieved the state of its burden and \u201cplainly run afoul of Winship\u2019s mandate.\u201d <em>Id. </em>at 234.</p>\n<p id=\"b432-4\">Here, although the Legislature has required proof beyond a reasonable doubt of mens rea,<footnotemark>7</footnotemark> the majority has rendered inadmissible evidence relevant to negating the mens rea. In so doing, it has foreclosed any meaningful challenge to the prosecution\u2019s proofs. With respect to specific intent crimes, at least, I believe that this \u201ccut[s] against our traditional concept of the adversary system\u201d and \u201cdowngrades the prosecution\u2019s burden to something less than that mandated by due process of law.\u201d <em>People v Hendershott, </em>653 P2d 385, 393 (Colo, 1982).</p>\n<p id=\"b432-5\">The majority asserts that <em>Fisher v United States,</em><footnotemark><em>8</em></footnotemark><em> </em>dispositively answers in the negative the question whether its holding today violates due process. In <em>Fisher, </em>the defendant was charged with first-degree premeditated murder arising from an incident inside a Washington, D.C., library. The defendant was the library\u2019s janitor. The evidence showed that on the fatal morning, the librarian told the defendant that he was not doing the work for which he was being paid, and in the course of her scolding called him a \u201cblack nigger.\u201d <em>Id. </em>at 479 (Frankfurter, J., dissenting). In anger, the defendant slapped the librarian \u201cimpulsively,\u201d causing her to scream. He then retrieved a piece of wood and struck her with it, after which he seized her by the throat until she went limp.</p>\n<p id=\"b433-4\"><page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"247\">*247</page-number>The defense theory was that he never wanted to kill the librarian, but wanted to stop her screaming, which unnerved him. <em>Id. </em>at 479-480 (Frankfurter, J., dissenting). At the close of proofs, the trial court instructed on insanity, irresistible impulse, malice, deliberation, and premeditation. Over defense counsel\u2019s objection, the trial court refused to give the following instruction:</p>\n<blockquote id=\"b433-5\">The jury is instructed that in considering the question of intent or lack of intent to kill on the part of the defendant, the question of premeditation or no premeditation, deliberation or no deliberation, whether or not the defendant at the time of the fatal acts was of sound memory and discretion, it should consider the entire personality of the defendant, his mental, nervous, emotional and physical characteristics as developed by the evidence in the case. <em>[Id. </em>at 470-471, n 6.1<footnotemark>9</footnotemark>]]</blockquote>\n<p id=\"b433-6\">Defendant was convicted as charged of first-degree murder.</p>\n<p id=\"b433-7\">The Supreme Court affirmed the conviction. It upheld the refusal to give the defendant\u2019s requested instruction. The Court noted that the defendant was challenging a local evidentiary rule that was long established and deeply rooted in the District of <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"248\">*248</page-number>Columbia. <em>Id. </em>at 477. It declined to force the District of Columbia to enact the rule of responsibility that the defendant sought, labeling the request \u201ca fundamental change in the common law theory of responsibility.\u201d <em>Id. </em>at 476.<footnotemark>10</footnotemark></p>\n<p id=\"b434-6\">The majority is correct that the Supreme Court in <em>Fisher </em>approved of the refusal to give an instruction bearing on whether a defendant acted with the requisite specific intent. However, I disagree that it resolves the instant defendant\u2019s due process challenge.</p>\n<p id=\"b434-7\">First, while the Supreme Court has never explicitly overruled <em>Fisher, </em>it has arguably done so by implication. <em>Fisher </em>must be interpreted in light of subsequent Supreme Court decisions. In my view, the line of cases starting with <em>In re Winship </em>and ending with <em>Martin </em>creates the inference that the rule of <em>Fisher </em>has been implicitly overruled.<footnotemark>11</footnotemark></p>\n<p id=\"b434-8\">In addition, more recent and, in my view, persuasive authority exists demonstrating the constitutional <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"249\">*249</page-number>infirmity of barring evidence of one\u2019s mental abnormalities short of insanity to negate specific intent. See, e.g., <em>Pohlot, supra </em>at 901,<footnotemark>12</footnotemark> stating that \u201ca rule barring evidence [of the defendant\u2019s mental abnormality] on the issue of mens rea may be unconstitutional so long as we determine criminal liability in part through subjective states of mind;\u201d see also <em>Ellis, supra </em>at 523; <em>Hendershott, supra </em>at 393.</p>\n<p id=\"b435-5\">In light of the above, I believe that <em>Fisher </em>does not control the instant case. Rather, I maintain that the majority\u2019s rule of exclusion violates due process. As the Colorado Supreme Court so astutely stated:</p>\n<blockquote id=\"b435-6\">While it may be permissible to permit a jury to infer an essential ingredient of a crime from a proven fact so long as there is a rational connection between the proven fact and the inferred fact, e.g., <em>Barnes v United States, </em>412 US 837; 93 S Ct 2357; 37 L Ed 2d 380 (1973); <em>Tot v United States, </em>319 US 463; 63 S Ct 1241; 87 L Ed 1519 (1943), it is quite another matter to insulate this ingredient from disproof by defense evidence. A rule precluding the defendant from contesting the culpability element of the charge would render the prosecution\u2019s evidence on that issue uncontestable as a matter of law, in derogation of the presumption of innocence and the constitutional requirement of prose-cutorial proof of guilty beyond a reasonable doubt. E.g., <em>Sandstrom v Montana, </em>442 US [510, 520-524; 99 S Ct 2450; 61 L Ed 2d 39 (1979)]; <em>Morissette [supra </em>at 274-275], <em>[Hen-dershott, supra </em>at 391.]</blockquote>\n<p id=\"b436-4\"><page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"250\">*250</page-number>There can be no question that the majority\u2019s holding affixes a heavy burden on defendants\u2019 due process rights. Because the majority provides no plausible justification, I think its holding violates due process.</p>\n<p id=\"b436-5\">H. NO PLAUSIBLE JUSTIFICATION FOR THE MAJORITY\u2019S BROAD RULE OF EXCLUSION</p>\n<p id=\"b436-6\">According to the majority, by enacting the insanity<footnotemark>13</footnotemark> and guilty but mentally ill (gbmi)<footnotemark>14</footnotemark> statutes, the Legislature created a scheme. It provided the requirements for and the effects of asserting a defense based on mental illness or retardation. The majority deduces from the scheme an intent to bar evidence of a defendant\u2019s lack of mental capacity short of insanity to negate specific intent. I disagree, and find its statutory interpretation analysis unpersuasive.</p>\n<p id=\"b436-7\">The first step in statutory interpretation is to give effect to the intent of the Legislature. See <em>Tryc v Michigan Veterans\u2019 Facility, </em>451 Mich 129, 135; 545 NW2d 642 (1996). To do so, we examine first the specific language of the statute. If the language is clear and unambiguous, we assume that the Legislature intended its plain meaning, and we will enforce the statute as written. See <em>In re MCI Telecommunications Complaint, </em>460 Mich 396, 411; 596 NW2d 164 (1999). This Court should reject an interpretation of a statute that speculates about legislative intent and requires us to add language into the statute. See <em>id. </em>at 414.</p>\n<p id=\"b437-4\"><page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"251\">*251</page-number>Here, importantly, neither the insanity statute nor the GBMI statute mentions the permissibility of using evidence of mental abnormality to negate specific intent. Rather, both statutes concern affirmative defenses available to a legally insane defendant.<footnotemark>15</footnotemark> These two statutes, by their plain language, apply only if a defendant seeks to introduce evidence of a mental illness to justify or excuse an otherwise criminal act.</p>\n<p id=\"b437-5\">This clearly contrasts with the introduction of diminished capacity evidence. The use of such evidence does not constitute an affirmative defense. See <em>Pohlot, supra </em>at 897. A defendant claiming diminished capacity does not admit guilt of the crime charged or assert that he is legally insane. Rather, he denies the prosecution\u2019s prima facie case by challenging its claim that he possessed the requisite mens rea at the time of the crime.<footnotemark>16</footnotemark> Hence, insanity evidence to prove the affirmative defense of legal insanity is distinct from diminished capacity evidence to disprove the requisite mens rea of a specific intent crime. See <em>United States v Gonyea, </em>140 F3d 649, 651 (CA 6, 1998).<footnotemark>17</footnotemark></p>\n<p id=\"b437-6\">I consider the distinction between the two,<footnotemark>18</footnotemark> coupled with the absence of language in the insanity and <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"252\">*252</page-number>gbmi statutes addressing the use of evidence of mental abnormality to negate the mens rea. And I cannot conclude that the Legislature intended to bar the use of evidence of one\u2019s mental abnormality short of insanity to negate specific intent when it enacted the insanity and gbmi statutes. See <em>MCI Telecommunica</em>tions, <em>supra </em>at 414.<footnotemark>19</footnotemark></p>\n<p id=\"b438-6\">I share the majority\u2019s concern that the accused who successfully show that their mental illness negated the requisite mens rea may be set free without treatment or imprisonment. However, that cannot justify reading into legislation a rule of exclusion per se where none exists.</p>\n<p id=\"b438-7\">By contrast, our Legislature has made it clear that a person may not be punished for a crime if the prosecution is unable to prove the necessary mens rea.<footnotemark>20</footnotemark> <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"253\">*253</page-number>Indeed, as one scholar explained in rejecting a concern similar to the one the majority presents here:</p>\n<blockquote id=\"b439-5\">Some may argue that persons who gain a failure of proof defense through the absence of a culpability requirement, through mistake or mental illness negating a required mental element, for example, are nonetheless dangerous. Special deterrence, then, is undercut when such failure of proof defenses are relied upon. The response is simple: if significant purposes of the criminal law are satisfied by a criminal conviction in this situation, then the offense should be redefined without the mental element requirements. If the purposes of conviction and punishment would not be satisfied by such an alteration, then the defense remains appropriate. [1 Robinson, Criminal Law Defenses, \u00a7 32(b), p 123, n 8.]</blockquote>\n<p id=\"b439-6\">Moreover, in most cases, defendants who successfully negate prosecutors\u2019 proofs will be convicted of a lesser, general intent offense. Even if lesser offenses are inapplicable, procedures exist for civil commitment of those acquitted of crimes who are considered potentially dangerous.<footnotemark>21</footnotemark> In any event, the proper resolution of this concern is not to bar relevant evidence.<footnotemark>22</footnotemark></p>\n<p id=\"b439-7\">The majority also attempts to justify its holding by asserting that a contrary rule would render the insanity defense superfluous. That a defendant has the <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"254\">*254</page-number>right to introduce psychiatric evidence to support the affirmative defense of insanity does not justify barring relevant evidence negating the prosecutor\u2019s case in chief. See <em>Pohlot, supra </em>at 901. Also, because evidence supporting an insanity defense and evidence negating specific intent address distinct questions, the breadth of the former is irrelevant to the question of the latter\u2019s admissibility.</p>\n<p id=\"AGQ\">The majority has taken the extreme step of barring defendants from introducing psychiatric evidence of mental abnormality to negate the mens rea of the crime charged. Because the rule it creates lacks sound justification, and because it renders the prosecution\u2019s proofs on the intent element essentially uncontestable, it violates defendant\u2019s due process rights. See, generally, <em>Sandstrom, supra </em>at 520-524; <em>Morissette, supra </em>at 275; <em>Martin, supra </em>at 233-234.<footnotemark>23</footnotemark></p>\n<p id=\"b440-6\">m. AUTHORITY FROM OTHER JURISDICTIONS</p>\n<p id=\"b440-7\">Several jurisdictions that have considered the admissibility of evidence of mental abnormality to negate mens rea have reached a conclusion contrary to that of the majority today. See Compton, <em>Expert witness testimony and the diminished capacity defense, </em>20 Am J Trial Advoc 381, 387-388, n 63 (1996-1997); <em>State v Mott, </em>187 Ariz 536, 555; 931 P2d 1046 (1997) (Feldman, J., dissenting). Nearly every federal circuit court has concluded that the insanity defense <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"255\">*255</page-number>reform act<footnotemark>24</footnotemark> does not bar evidence of mental abnormality to negate mens rea. See <em>Pohlot, supra </em>at 900-901; <em>United States v Marenghi, </em>893 F Supp 85, 89 (D Me, 1995) (collecting cases).</p>\n<p id=\"b441-5\">I would follow this persuasive authority, and conclude that evidence of mental abnormality or illness is admissible to negate specific intent. Such a position merely reaffirms three concepts basic to our system of jurisprudence: the right to present a meaningful defense, the requirement that the state prove beyond a reasonable doubt each and every element of a charged offense, and the presumption of innocence.</p>\n<p id=\"b441-6\">IV. CONCLUSION</p>\n<p id=\"b441-7\">The majority categorically excludes relevant and material evidence that directly concerns an essential element of specific intent crimes. This violates a defendant\u2019s due process right to present a defense, ignores the requirement of proof of guilt beyond a reasonable doubt, and derogates the presumption of innocence. Because the majority fails to justify its heavy burdening of defendant\u2019s due process rights, I am unable to join its opinion.</p>\n<p id=\"b441-8\">I write, also, because I am troubled that the majority is deciding this case on a ground that the prosecutor never argued until its brief on appeal to this <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"256\">*256</page-number>Court. To the extent that this Court rejects arguments not raised below by criminal defendants, it should reject those not raised below by the prosecution. Adding insult to injury, the majority has turned the prosecution\u2019s tardy argument into a rule of exclusion that, I believe, cannot withstand constitutional scrutiny.

The assertion is simply inaccurate. Put most simply, one who uses diminished capacity evidence seeks merely to ensure that no conviction occurs except upon proof beyond a reasonable doubt of every element of the offense. See <em>Morse, supra </em>at 6. If diminished capacity evidence creates a reasonable doubt regarding one of the elements of the crime charged, the defendant is not \u201cavoiding responsibility\u201d for that crime. Rather, he is attaining that to which he is constitutionally entitled: an acquittal of that offense. See <em>Morissette, supra </em>at 275. In my view, this distinction is significant, and persuades me that the insanity and gbmi statutes evidence no clear legislative intent to exclude diminished capacity evidence.</p>\n</footnote>\n<footnote label=\"19\">\n<p id=\"b438-9\"> Notably, this Court has acknowledged that the legislative intent in enacting the gbmi statute was to \u201climit the number of persons who, in the eyes of the Legislature, were <em>improperly </em>being relieved of all criminal responsibility by way of the insanity verdict.\u201d <em>People v Ramsey, </em>422 Mich 500, 512; 375 NW2d 297 (1985) (emphasis in original).
