On review of the incompatible offices act as a whole, we conclude that the phrase \u201cpublic offices held by a public official,\u201d MCL 15.181(b), encompasses positions of public employment. However, we conclude that defendant\u2019s positions are not inherently incompatible because only a potential breach of duty of public office arises from the ability of the township to contract with the county for the collection of its delinquent personal property taxes. We therefore reverse the decision of the Court of Appeals and remand to the circuit court for entry of an order granting summary disposition for defendant.</p>\n<p id=\"b337-5\">i. factual background and procedural posture</p>\n<p id=\"b337-6\">Defendant is an elected trustee of Harrison Township. She is also the delinquent personal property tax coordinator in the Macomb County treasurer\u2019s office. Under MCL 211.56(3), a township board of trustees and the board of county commissioners, with the concurrence of the county treasurer, may agree that the county treasurer will collect the township\u2019s delinquent personal property taxes. The Harrison Township Board of Trustees considered such an arrange<page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"152\">*152</page-number>ment in March 1994. A trustee eventually moved that the township continue to collect its delinquent taxes. Defendant supported that motion. The motion carried.</p>\n<p id=\"b338-5\">The possibility of having the county treasurer collect the township taxes was, however, raised again five months later. A trustee requested additional information about the revenue generated if the township were to collect its own delinquent taxes. In light of this development, the board requested plaintiff Macomb County Prosecuting Attorney\u2019s opinion whether defendant had a conflict of interest because of her dual positions.</p>\n<p id=\"b338-6\">Plaintiff opined that defendant\u2019s offices were \u201cnot necessarily incompatible, but . . . will be deemed to be incompatible if the township trustee is presented with a situation in which he or she is required to vote on a proposal to have the county collect delinquent personal property taxes.\u201d In this case, plaintiff concluded that even though the board had already voted to continue collecting the taxes, defendant\u2019s offices were incompatible because the board was still exploring the possibility of entering into an agreement with the county. Defendant declined to follow plaintiff\u2019s suggestion that she resign from one of her positions.</p>\n<p id=\"b338-7\">Plaintiff then sought a declaratory ruling that defendant had violated the incompatible offices act by breaching a duty of public office. The trial court granted summary disposition for plaintiff under MCR 2.116(C)(10). The court concluded that defendant\u2019s positions were incompatible offices because the board of. trustees had considered the question whether the county treasurer should collect delinquent taxes and defendant\u2019s vote affected her. interest <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"153\">*153</page-number>as tax coordinator. The trial court directed that defendant vacate one of the positions. The court denied defendant\u2019s motion for reconsideration, but stayed enforcement of its order pending appeal.</p>\n<p id=\"b339-4\">The Court of Appeals granted defendant\u2019s delayed application for leave to appeal and affirmed.<footnotemark>1</footnotemark> The Court concluded that a breach of duty arises when a public official \u201c \u2018cannot protect, advance, or promote the interest of both offices simultaneously.\u2019 \u201d 233 Mich App 381, quoting OAG, 1997-1998, No 6931, p 5 (February 3, 1997). The Court further reasoned that a breach occurs when an \u201cissue arises in which one constituency\u2019s interests may conflict with the interests of a separate constituency represented by the official.\u201d <em>Id. </em>at 382. It rejected defendant\u2019s arguments that the extent of conflict between her positions was minimal and that a question of fact existed regarding how a township-county agreement would affect her position as tax coordinator. The Court also concluded that the trial court properly found that defendant voted on a proposal to have the county collect the township taxes. The Court reasoned that defendant implicitly voted not to enter into an agreement with the county when she voted in favor of the township collecting its own taxes.<footnotemark>2</footnotemark></p>\n<p id=\"b339-5\">This Court granted defendant\u2019s application for leave to appeal. 462 Mich 854 (2000).</p>\n<p id=\"af-dedup-0\"><page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"154\">*154</page-number>II. DISCUSSION</p>\n<p id=\"b340-6\">The question presented is whether defendant violated the incompatible offices act by simultaneously holding positions as the delinquent personal property tax coordinator in the Macomb County treasurer\u2019s office and as an elected member of the Harrison Township Board of Trustees. We conclude that defendant\u2019s positions are not inherently incompatible because only a potential breach of duty of public office arises from the ability of the township to contract with the county for the collection of its delinquent personal property taxes.</p>\n<p id=\"b340-7\">A. THE INCOMPATIBLE OFFICES ACT</p>\n<p id=\"b340-8\">The incompatible offices act,<footnotemark>3</footnotemark> at MCL 15.182, contains the general prohibition against holding incompatible offices. It provides that \u201c[e]xcept as provided in [MCL 15.183], a public officer or public employee shall not hold 2 or more incompatible offices at the same time.\u201d<footnotemark>4</footnotemark></p>\n<p id=\"b341-4\"><page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"155\">*155</page-number>The Legislature defined the phrase \u201cincompatible offices\u201d for purposes of the act. MCL 151.181(b) provides:</p>\n<blockquote id=\"b341-5\">\u201cIncompatible offices\u201d means public offices held by a public official which, when the official is performing the duties of any of the public offices held by the official, results in any of the following with respect to those offices held:</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b341-6\">(i) The subordination of 1 public office to another.</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b341-7\">(\u00fc) The supervision of 1 public office by another.</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b341-8\">(iii) A breach of duty of public office.</blockquote>\n<p id=\"b341-9\">The Legislature also created exceptions to the general prohibition on holding incompatible offices. MCL 15.183<footnotemark>5</footnotemark> now generally allows public officers and em<page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"156\">*156</page-number>ployees to serve on boards of institutions of higher education and permits a school superintendent to serve as a member of a school board of another dis<page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"157\">*157</page-number>trict. The statute also allows public officers and employees of local units of government to serve as members of boards of tax increment finance authorities, downtown development authorities, and local development finance authorities. Finally, the statute generally allows public officers and employees of units of local government having small populations to serve as emergency medical services personnel, firefighters, and perform other services for that unit of government.</p>\n<p id=\"b343-4\">The act does not create a private cause of action. MCL 15.184. Rather, it grants the Attorney General and county prosecuting attorneys the authority to apply to the circuit court \u201cfor injunctive or other appropriate judicial relief or remedy.\u201d <em>Id. </em>A violation of the act does not render an action of a public officer or public employee absolutely void. MCL 15.185. Instead, the decision to void an action lies within the discretion of the circuit court. <em>Id.</em></p>\n<p id=\"b343-5\">B. PUBLIC OFFICES HELD BY A PUBLIC OFFICIAL</p>\n<p id=\"b343-6\">We reject defendant\u2019s initial argument<footnotemark>6</footnotemark> that her positions are not \u201cincompatible offices\u201d because her position as delinquent personal property tax coordinator is not a \u201cpublic office.\u201d The question is one of statutory construction, which we review de novo. <em>The Herald Co v Bay City, </em>463 Mich 111, 117; 614 NW2d 873 (2000). Our task is made difficult by the Legislature\u2019s inartful draftsmanship. In particular, the Legis<page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"158\">*158</page-number>lature used the undefined term \u201cpublic official\u201d in defining the phrase \u201cincompatible offices\u201d instead of the defined terms \u201cpublic officer\u201d and \u201cpublic employee.\u201d Construing the act as a whole, however, we conclude that the phrase \u201cpublic offices held by a public official\u201d encompasses public employment.</p>\n<p id=\"b344-5\">In considering a question of statutory construction, this Court begins by examining the language of the statute. <em>Sun Valley Foods Co v Ward, </em>460 Mich 230, 236; 596 NW2d 119 (1999). We read the statutory language in context to determine whether ambiguity exists. <em>Id. </em>at 237; see <em>Consumers Power Co v Public Service Comm, </em>460 Mich 148, 163, n 10; 596 NW2d 126 (1999). If the language is unambiguous, judicial construction is precluded. <em>Frankenmuth Mut Ins Co v Marlette Homes, Inc, </em>456 Mich 511, 515; 573 NW2d 611 (1998). We enforce an unambiguous statute as written. <em>Sun Valley Foods, supra </em>at 236. Where ambiguity exists, however, this Court seeks to effectuate the Legislature\u2019s intent through a reasonable construction, considering the purpose of the statute and the object sought to be accomplished. <em>Frankenmuth Mut Ins, supra </em>at 515.</p>\n<p id=\"b344-6\">The statute involved in this case defines the phrase \u201cincompatible offices\u201d as \u201cpublic offices held by a public official which, when the official is performing the duties of any of the public offices held by the official, results in\u201d the subordination of one public office to another, the supervision of one public office by another, or a breach of duty of public office. MCL 151.181(b).</p>\n<p id=\"b344-7\">We construe the undefined terms \u201cpublic office\u201d and \u201cpublic official\u201d according to the common usage of the language. <em>Consumers Power, supra </em>at 163. The dictionary definitions of the words \u201cpublic,\u201d \u201cofficial,\u201d <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"159\">*159</page-number>and \u201cofficer\u201d suggest that the terms \u201cpublic official\u201d and \u201cpublic officer\u201d are synonymous.<footnotemark>7</footnotemark> Words, however, are given meaning by context or setting. <em>Id. </em>at 163, n 10. In defining the phrase \u201cincompatible offices,\u201d the Legislature used the term \u201cpublic official,\u201d rather than the term it defined in the statute\u2014 \u201cpublic officer.\u201d The Legislature\u2019s use of this undefined term when it could have easily employed the defined term suggests that the terms are not synonymous for purposes of this statute. See 82 CJS, Statutes, \u00a7 310, pp 400-401. We therefore conclude that the statutory language \u201cpublic offices held by a public official\u201d is ambiguous.</p>\n<p id=\"b345-4\">To resolve this ambiguity, we examine the other provisions of the act to ascertain whether the Legislature intended to include positions of public employment within the prohibition on incompatible offices. We construe an act as a whole to harmonize its provisions and carry out the purpose of the Legislature. <em>Farrington v Total Petroleum, Inc, </em>442 Mich 201, 209; <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"160\">*160</page-number>501 MW2d 76 (1993); <em>Gusler v Fairview Tubular Products, </em>412 Mich 270, 291; 315 NW2d 388 (1981), reh gtd 414 Mich 1102 (1982), app dis 414 Mich 1102 (1983). \u201c[T]he interpretation to be given to a particular word in one section [is] arrived at after due consideration of every other section so as to produce, if possible, a harmonious and consistent enactment as a whole.\u201d <em>Grand Rapids v Crocker, </em>219 Mich 178, 182-183; 189 NW 221 (1922).</p>\n<p id=\"b346-5\">We conclude that \u00a7\u00a7 2 and 3 of the incompatible offices act evince a legislative intent to include positions of public employment within the scope of the act. MCL 15.182 provides that \u201ca public officer <em>or public employee </em>shall not hold 2 or more incompatible offices at the same time.\u201d The section prohibits particular individuals from holding two or more incompatible offices at the same time. The Legislature could have simply omitted any reference to public employees if it intended that the prohibition apply only to positions held by public officers. The statute would have provided that \u201ca public officer shall not hold 2 or more incompatible offices at the same time.\u201d Under this alternate language, a public employee would not have been prohibited from holding one public office because the employee would not become a \u201cpublic officer\u201d until elected or appointed to the first office. The employee would then only hold one public office, not two. Accordingly, on review of \u00a7 2 of the act, we conclude that the Legislature\u2019s inclusion of public employees within the prohibition evinces an intent that positions of public employment are \u201cpublic offices held by a public official.\u201d<footnotemark>8</footnotemark></p>\n<p id=\"b347-4\"><page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"161\">*161</page-number>The exceptions contained in the act, MCL 15.183, similarly reveal a legislative intent that positions of public employment fall within the scope of the act.</p>\n<p id=\"b347-5\">Exceptions (1), (3) and (4) expressly apply to public officers or <em>public employees. </em>Moreover, the prefatory phrase of those exceptions (\u201cSection 2 does not . . .\u201d) signals that the prohibition contained in \u00a7 2 generally applies to both public officers and public employees. If the prohibition did not apply to public employees, no need would exist to include public employees within the exception.</p>\n<p id=\"b347-6\">On review of the statute as a whole, we thus conclude that the phrase \u201cpublic offices held by a public official\u201d encompasses positions of public employment. Although the Legislature could have evinced its intent in clearer terms, we join the Attorney General<footnotemark>9</footnotemark> and the Court of Appeals<footnotemark>10</footnotemark> in adopting this reasonable construction of the statutory language because it best furthers the Legislature\u2019s intent, as reflected in the other provisions of the act.<footnotemark>11</footnotemark> We therefore conclude <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"162\">*162</page-number>that defendant\u2019s positions as delinquent property tax coordinator and township trustee both are \u201cpublic offices held by a public official\u201d for purposes of the incompatible offices act. We thus turn to the question whether defendant\u2019s performance of the duties of one of the offices resulted in one of the three situations set forth in MCL 151.181(b).</p>\n<p id=\"b348-5\">C. BREACH OF DUTY OF PUBLIC OFFICE</p>\n<p id=\"b348-6\">The statute defines \u201cincompatible offices\u201d as \u201cpublic offices held by a public official which, when the official is performing the duties of any of the public offices held by the official, results in\u201d the subordination of one public office to another, the supervision of one public office by another, or \u201c[a] breach of duty of public office.\u201d MCL 151.181(b). The parties agree that this case does not involve the first two prohibited situations. We therefore limit our review to determining whether defendant\u2019s performance of her duties resulted in a breach of duty of public office. We conclude that defendant\u2019s positions are not inherently incompatible because only a potential breach of duty of public office arises from the ability of the township to contract with the county for the collection of its delinquent personal property taxes.</p>\n<p id=\"b348-7\">Under the statute, incompatibility exists only when the performance of the duties of one of the public <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"163\">*163</page-number>offices \u201cresults in\u201d one of the three prohibited situations. By using the phrase \u201cresults in,\u201d the Legislature clearly restricted application of the statutory bar to situations in which the specified outcomes or consequences of a particular action actually occur.<footnotemark>12</footnotemark> That a breach of duty <em>may </em>occur in the future or that a <em>potential </em>conflict exists does not establish incompatible offices. The official\u2019s performance of the duties of one of the offices must actually result in a breach of duty.</p>\n<p id=\"b349-4\">The Attorney General recognized this limitation in 1979-1980 OAG No 5626, pp 537-542 (January 16, 1980). The Attorney General explained:</p>\n<blockquote id=\"b349-5\">[I]n many situations the public official may be able to perform the functions of two public offices without breaching a duty of either office by simply not performing a function which may constitute a breach of duty.</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b349-6\">By way of illustration, under the common law the authority of two public entities to contract with each other would prohibit the same person from serving both in positions of influence in determining whether to approve, amend or implement the contract since the person could not give complete loyalty to one entity without some sacrifice of loyalty to the other. This would be true even if the two public entities had not contracted with each other in the past or contemplated doing so in the foreseeable future. It was the potential for conflict which was determinative, even though no actual conflict of duties has occurred. . . .</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b349-7\">Where, however, incompatibility arises only when the <em>performance of the duties </em>of the two offices <em>results </em>in a breach of duty of a public office, there is not incompatibility until the two public entities actually enter into contractual negotiations with each other. Also, in such cases, the <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"164\">*164</page-number>public officer or employee may avoid breaching his or her duty of loyalty by abstaining from participating in the consideration of the contract.</blockquote>\n<p id=\"b350-5\">We agree with the Court of Appeals that a breach of duty arises when a public official holding dual offices cannot protect, advance, or promote the interest of both offices simultaneously. Public officers and employees owe a duty of loyalty to the public. 63C Am Jur 2d, Public Officers and Employees, \u00a7 247, p 690. \u201cAll public officers are agents, and their official powers are fiduciary. They are trusted with public functions of the good of the public; to protect, advance and promote its interests . . . .\u201d <em>People ex rel Plugger v Twp Bd of Overyssel, </em>11 Mich 222, 225 (1863) (opinion of Manning, J.).</p>\n<p id=\"b350-6\">The Court of Appeals, however, erroneously held that a breach of duty exists when \u201can issue arises in which one constituency\u2019s interests may conflict with the interests of a separate constituency represented by the official.\u201d 233 Mich App 382. In so concluding, the Court failed to recognize that the statute focuses on the manner in which the official actually performs the duties of public office. The Court thus disregarded the statutory language requiring an actual breach of duty.<footnotemark>13</footnotemark> <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"165\">*165</page-number>In this case, the circuit court erred in granting summary disposition for plaintiff under MCE 2.116(C)(10).<footnotemark>14</footnotemark> The township and the county unquestionably may contract for the collection of delinquent personal property taxes. MCL 211.56(3). Defendant coordinates the division of the county. treasurer\u2019s office that handles day-to-day collection matters.

In light of the absence of any genuine issue of material fact, the court should have granted summary disposition for defendant under MCR 2.116(I)(2).

CONCLUSION</p>\n<p id=\"b352-7\">We conclude that defendant\u2019s positions are not inherently incompatible because only a potential breach of duty of public office arises from the ability of the township to contract with the county for the <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"167\">*167</page-number>collection of its delinquent personal property taxes. Under the circumstances of this case, defendant\u2019s holding of dual offices did not violate the incompatible offices act because the governmental entities never entered into contractual negotiations.

In OAG, 1963-1964, No 4309, p 459 (September 11, 1964), the Attorney General opined that the common-law rule against incompatibility extended to public employment or position. The Attorney General reiterated that conclusion in OAG, 1967-1968, No 4620, pp 278, 279 (August 7,1968), stating that \u201c[t]he rule of incompatibility has been extended to public employment where the duties of the public employment and the public office are incompatible so that they may not be simultaneously exercised by the same person.\u201d</p>\n</footnote>\n<footnote label=\"9\">\n<p id=\"b347-8\"> OAG, 1979-1980, No 5626, pp 537, 541 (January 16, 1980).</p>\n</footnote>\n<footnote label=\"10\">\n<p id=\"b347-9\"> <em>Wayne Co Prosecutor v Kinney, </em>184 Mich App 681, 683; 458 NW2d 674 (1990).</p>\n</footnote>\n<footnote label=\"11\">\n<p id=\"b347-10\"> Our construction of the statutory language is also consistent with the words chosen by the Legislature in amending the act. The Legislature has amended the incompatible offices act three times. 1984 PA 72; 1992 PA 10; 1994 PA 317. The 1984 amendment added an exception that allows public officers and employees of a city, school district, community college district or county to serve as a member of the board of tax increment finance authority. The 1992 amendment extended that exception to membership on downtown development authorities and local development <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"162\">*162</page-number>finance authorities. The 1992 amendment also added an exception for public officers and public employees of local units of government having populations less than 25,000. The 1994 amendment made stylistic changes and extended the exception for development and finance authorities to employees and officers of villages and townships. As with the exceptions contained in the original act, these exceptions use language that suggests that public employment constitutes a public office for purposes of the prohibition on holding incompatible offices.</p>\n</footnote>\n<footnote label=\"12\">\n<p id=\"b349-8\"> <em>Random House Webster\u2019s College Dictionary, </em>p 1148, defines the verb \u201cresult\u201d as \u201c1. to arise or proceed as a consequence from actions, circumstances, premises, etc.; be the outcome. 2. to terminate or end in a specified manner or thing: <em>to result in failure.\"</em></p>\n</footnote>\n<footnote label=\"13\">\n<p id=\"b350-7\"> The dissent would \u201cfocus\u201d the breach of duty inquiry beyond contract negotiations or contract formation. The dissent asserts that contract negotiations and formation are merely examples of situations where conflicts of interest and breaches of duty may occur. The dissent concedes that an actual, not potential, conflict of interest must exist. <em>Post </em>at 170-171. It finds nothing in the statutory language of the act that justifies, much less compels, the contract-or-negotiation limitation on the breach of duty inquiry, and thus the inquiry must transcend that artificial barrier.</p>\n<p id=\"b350-8\">The dissent\u2019s interpretation of the act is an invitation for political mischief. If the act reaches potential conflicts of interest, the likelihood of political shenanigans escalates. For example, a township board member could compel the removal of another board member who is also an <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"165\">*165</page-number>employee of a public university by forcing a vote on a proposal that the board consider entering into a contract with the university for the study of grass diseases around the township hall. The dissent would hold that a mere proposal to consider entering into negotiations for such a contract raises a potential conflict of interest requiring that board member to choose which position to abandon.</p>\n<p id=\"A92\">On the contrary, the statutory language defining \u201cincompatible offices\u201d as offices that, \u201cwhen the official <em>is performing the duties of.. . office . . . results in .. . </em>(iii) a breach of duty\u201d reflects a legislative intent to eschew the common-law focus on <em>potential </em>conflicts in favor of <em>actual </em>breaches of duty. This legislative choice encourages civic-minded individuals to engage in public service in as many capacities as they choose, without limiting their involvement through concerns about <em>potential </em>conflicts of interest. The Legislature has focused on <em>actual </em>breaches, recognizing the value of enabling public employees to serve in public offices when they are off duty. The act is, in effect, a public employees enabling act. Thus, our interpretation is consistent with the plain language of the statute.</p>\n<p id=\"AhL\">The dissent asserts that defendant\u2019s vote constitutes a breach of duty <em>even if </em>the contract-or-negotiation limitation is valid, characterizing the vote essentially as a contract or negotiation decision. We reject the dissent\u2019s characterization of defendant\u2019s preliminary vote as a negotiation-or-contract decision.</p>\n</footnote>\n<footnote label=\"14\">\n<p id=\"b351-8\"> In reviewing a motion for summary disposition under MCR 2.116(C)(10), the trial court considers the documentary evidence submitted by the parties in a light most favorable to the party opposing the motion. <em>Smith v Globe Life Ins Co, </em>460 Mich 446, 454; 597 NW2d 28 (1999). The trial court may grant the motion if the documentary evidence creates no genuine issue of material fact for trial and the moving party is entitled to judgment as a matter of law. <em>Id. </em>at 454455. We review de novo the trial court\u2019s ruling on a motion for summary disposition. <em>Id. </em>at 454.</p>\n</footnote>\n<footnote label=\"15\">\n<p id=\"b352-8\"> Defendant should have abstained from voting on the motion that the township continue to collect its delinquent personal property taxes. By voting on the motion, defendant breached a duty of loyalty to Macomb County. We do not, however, view this action as necessitating that defendant vacate one of her positions because the township never negotiated with the county and has not entered into an agreement with the county. Under these circumstances, the circuit court had discretion whether to void the defendant\u2019s action in voting on the motion. MCL 15.185. In light of the passage of time and the absence of any indication in the record that defendant cast the deciding vote, we conclude that the circuit court should not void defendant\u2019s action.</p>\n<p id=\"b352-9\">The dissent asserts that if the contract-or-negotiation limitation is invalid, the vote manifests an actual conflict of interest and thus a violation of the incompatible offices act (part n). We decline to characterize defendant\u2019s vote as a negotiation-or-contract decision. Moreover, although MCL 211.56(3) allows a county treasurer to reimburse itself for the costs of collecting the delinquent taxes, and to transfer to the county\u2019s general fund any funds exceeding the costs of collection, the record in this case contains no proof the Macomb County Treasurer\u2019s best interest was to contract with the township.</p>\n</footnote>\n</opinion>\n<opinion data-order=\"10\" data-type=\"opinion\" id=\"x999-2\" type=\"concurring-in-part-and-dissenting-in-part\">\n<author id=\"b353-5\">Cavanagh, J.</author>\n<p id=\"AMvr\"><em>(concurring in part and dissenting in part). </em>I agree with the majority that the phrase \u201cpublic offices held by a public official\u201d encompasses positions of public employment. Also, I agree that the defendant\u2019s positions as delinquent property tax coordinator and township trustee both constitute \u201cpublic offices held by a public official\u201d as defined in the incompatible offices act (ioa), MCL 15.181(b). Therefore, I join parts h(a) and n(B) of the majority opinion. However, I disagree with the majority\u2019s conclusion that the defendant\u2019s holding of dual offices did not violate the IOA. Rather, I agree with the courts below that the defendant\u2019s offices were impermissibly incompatible, and would affirm summary disposition in favor of the plaintiff. Therefore, I respectfully dissent from part n(c) and the result of the majority opinion.</p>\n<p id=\"b353-6\">i</p>\n<p id=\"b353-7\">Section (2) of the incompatible public offices act prohibits a public officer or public employee from holding two or more incompatible offices simultane<page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"168\">*168</page-number>ously. MCL 15.182. \u201cIncompatible public offices\u201d are defined at MCL 15.181(b) as follows:</p>\n<blockquote id=\"b354-5\">\u201cIncompatible offices\u201d mean public offices held by a public official which, when the official is performing the duties of any of the public offices held by the official, results in any of the following with respect to those offices held:</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b354-6\">(i) The subordination of one public office to another.</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b354-7\">(ii) The supervision of one public office by another.</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b354-8\">(iii) A breach of duty of public office.</blockquote>\n<p id=\"b354-9\">Only subsection (iii) is presently at issue. Specifically, we are faced with whether a violation of the IOA occurred when the defendant, in her capacity as township trustee, chose to vote in favor of a motion to have the township continue to collect its own taxes.</p>\n<p id=\"b354-10\">The majority holds that the defendant did not breach a duty of public office by voting in favor of allowing the township to continue collecting its own taxes because the vote did not result in contractual negotiations or create a contractual relationship between the county and the township. The majority\u2019s position springs from 1979-1980 OAG No 5626, 537 (January 16, 1980), in which the Attorney General distinguished the common law from the IOA. According to the Attorney General, the common law prohibited a single person from holding dual positions of influence with public entities that had authority to contract with one another, whereas the IOA finds incompatibility only when the performance of the duties of the offices results in a breach of duty of public office. The primary distinction, the Attorney General opined, is that the common law focused on the offices themselves, while the IOA focuses on the officer\u2019s actions. As such, the Attorney General rea<page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"169\">*169</page-number>soned that incompatibility does not arise until the two public entities actually enter into contractual negotiations with each other. Also, the Attorney General noted that, in such cases, the public officer can avoid breaching the duty of loyalty by abstaining from consideration of the contract.</p>\n<p id=\"b355-4\">I cannot agree with the majority that the statutory violation in this case arose merely from the fact that the township and the county had the ability to contract with one another. Further, I disagree with 1979-1980 OAG No 5626, 537 (January 16, 1980), to the extent that it implies that, in cases involving an officer who holds positions with two entities that have.the ability to contract with one another, the performance of an officer\u2019s duties can only result in a breach at the point at which two entities enter into contract negotiations with each other. Nowhere does the ioa provide that public offices will be incompatible only when a party holding the public offices is placed on the competing ends of a contract or contract negotiations. The focus is instead on whether a duty has been breached.</p>\n<p id=\"b355-5\">Public officials are charged with a variety of duties, the breach of which may potentially result in an ioa violation. Though a public official\u2019s decision to participate in contract negotiations is one example of a situation where a breach of duty of public office may arise, the statutory language simply does not support the assertion that it is the only example.</p>\n<p id=\"b355-6\">Even assuming that subsection (iii) supports a finding of incompatibility only when an officer\u2019s performance of his duties bears upon the competing entities\u2019 abilities to contract with one another, the majority fails to recognize that a vote to decide whether the township should be allowed to continue collecting its <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"170\">*170</page-number>own taxes is a decision against entering a contract to have someone else collect taxes. Though the vote in question did not explicitly mention the possibility that the township could alternatively enter into a contract allowing Macomb County to collect taxes, the result of the vote was the same as if the question had been \u201cshould the township collect its own taxes or should the township cohtract with Macomb County?\u201d In either case, the vote foreclosed the possibility that the county would be enabled to collect taxes.</p>\n<p id=\"b356-5\">For these reasons, I believe that our focus must extend beyond the question whether a contractual relationship has been entered between the county and the township. Instead, we should consider whether the contested action, here a vote to decide who is responsible for collecting taxes, amounts to the performance of one duty and the breach of another.<footnotemark>1</footnotemark></p>\n<p id=\"b356-6\">n</p>\n<p id=\"b356-7\">Having decided that our focus should be on the statutory language, we must next determine what constitutes a breach and whether a breach occurred in this case. The majority adopts the Court of Appeals view that \u201ca breach of duty arises when a public official holding dual offices cannot protect, advance, or promote the interest of both offices simultaneously.\u201d <em>Ante </em>at 164. The cited basis for this premise is that public officers are fiduciaries who owe a duty of loyalty to the public. The majority then concludes that two public offices will not be deemed incompatible simply because one official represents two constitu<page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"171\">*171</page-number>encies, each of which may have interests that conflict with the other\u2019s interests. Instead, the majority holds, an actual breach must exist.</p>\n<p id=\"b357-4\">I agree with the majority that the question under subsection (iii) of the ioa is not whether a particular officer might potentially face a conflict of interest or breach of duty at some undetermined point in the future. The statutory use of the word \u201cbreach\u201d and the phrase \u201cis performing the duties\u201d imply that an officer\u2019s performance is relevant to whether an ioa violation has occurred. Similarly, the use of the word \u201cresults\u201d implies that a situation actually must have arisen in which the officer has breached one duty through the performance of another. For this reason, the ioa does seem to support the proposition that an actual event must trigger the breach contemplated by subsection (iii). For example, had the township never considered whether it should collect its own taxes, the defendant\u2019s duties as tax coordinator would only potentially conflict with her duties as township trustee. However, at the moment the township took up the tax question, the vote that occurred had an effect on the township itself and on the township\u2019s relationship (or nonrelationship) with the county. I believe that the majority errs in concluding that no breach existed in this case.</p>\n<p id=\"b357-5\">The circuit court recognized a problem that the majority does not. It held:</p>\n<blockquote id=\"b357-6\">In the instant matter, a situation has arisen involving both of defendant\u2019s offices which has resulted in a breach of her public duty. The issue of whether to allow Macomb County to collect delinquent property taxes \u2014 and related fees, expenses, interest, penalties and other <em>charges </em>\u2014 has <em>been presented </em>to the Harrison Township Board of Trustees. <em>Defendant\u2019s vote on this issue as a township trustee </em><page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"172\">*172</page-number><em>impacts her interests </em>as a delinquent personal property tax coordinator for the county. This conflict is unavoidable and defendant can not protect, advance, or promote the interests of both her offices with disinterested skill, zeal and diligence. [Emphasis added.]</blockquote>\n<p id=\"b358-6\">The circuit court decision was based on the premise that the defendant\u2019s decision to vote on the measure resulted in the breach of her duty to the county.<footnotemark>2</footnotemark>1 do not believe that the circuit court committed an error requiring reversal in holding that the defendant\u2019s decision to vote in her capacity as trustee affected her duties as delinquent property tax coordinator.</p>\n<p id=\"b358-7\">Even the majority acknowledges that \u201c[b]y voting on the motion, defendant breached a duty of loyalty to Macomb County.\u201d <em>Ante </em>at 166, n 15. The majority further implicitly recognizes the predicament created by the vote when it submits that the defendant \u201cshould have abstained from voting on the motion.\u201d <em>Id. </em>However, the majority summarily dismisses the defendant\u2019s breach in a footnote. <em>Id.</em><footnotemark><em>3</em></footnotemark></p>\n<p id=\"b358-8\">I cannot join the majority\u2019s dismissal of the defendant\u2019s breach.<footnotemark>4</footnotemark> Given the statutory language, I fail to <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"173\">*173</page-number>see how the breach can be excused. Rather, the defendant\u2019s actions constitute a breach under the majority\u2019s own test. She could not \u201cprotect, advance, or promote the interest of both offices simultaneously\u201d as the majority purports to require. <em>Ante </em>at 164. Unlike the majority, I believe that the defendant\u2019s decision to vote triggered the ioa, and that her offices are incompatible. Therefore, I would affirm summary disposition in favor of the plaintiffs.</p>\n<judges id=\"b359-3\">Weaver and Kelly, JJ., concurred with Cavanagh, J.</judges>\n<footnote label=\"1\">\n<p id=\"b356-8\"> While the majority believes that my approach invites mischief, I believe that it is an approach required by the legislative language. Cries of mischief should, therefore, be directed toward the Legislature.</p>\n</footnote>\n<footnote label=\"2\">\n<p id=\"b358-9\"> As the circuit court recognized, a township trustee is duty bound to carry out the business of the township as an agent and fiduciary of the township. See <em>People v Hirschfield, </em>271 Mich 20, 25; 260 NW 106 (1935). In the present controversy, the question is whether the defendant\u2019s decision to carry out the business of the township by voting on a motion to continue the township\u2019s tax collection policy breached a duty she owed either to the township or to the county.</p>\n</footnote>\n<footnote label=\"3\">\n<p id=\"b358-10\"> Contrary to the majority\u2019s assertion, I believe that an actual, rather than potential, breach occurred in this case.</p>\n</footnote>\n<footnote label=\"4\">\n<p id=\"b358-11\"> Similarly, I cannot agree that the harm can be remedied by declaring that the defendant \u201cshould have abstained.\u201d In so concluding, the majority implicates a number of questions that are not before this Court. Arguably, the defendant became unable to avoid a breach of duty once the <em>vote </em>arose. It is also arguable that a decision to abstain would have, in itself, illustrated the defendant\u2019s inability to serve the interests of the township. See, e.g., <em>Contesti v Attorney General, </em>164 Mich App 271; 416 NW2d 410 (1987), quoting OAG 1979-1980, No 5626, 545 (January 16, 1980), for the <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"173\">*173</page-number>proposition that abstention may eliminate a conflict of interest, but not incompatibility of offices. In any event, we need not decide the issue because the defendant did actually vote.</p>\n</footnote>\n</opinion>\n</casebody>\n",
