Further, the parties agreed that a public hearing on the remaining allegations contained in paragraphs 18 through 25 of the complaint would be held before the full nine-member commission rather than the appointed master. This hearing occurred on March 13, 2000. On July 18, 2000, the commission issued its decision regarding misconduct, finding that Judge Moore had committed various instances of misconduct.<footnotemark>2</footnotemark> In its recommendation for order of discipline, filed October 10, 2000, the commission recommended that Judge Moore be suspended for nine months without pay.</p>\n<p id=\"b285-6\">On de novo review,<footnotemark>3</footnotemark> we conclude that Judge Moore committed misconduct. However, we disagree that a nine-month suspension is warranted. Instead, we order Judge Moore suspended for six months without pay.</p>\n<p id=\"AMv\"><page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"100\">*100</page-number>i</p>\n<p id=\"b286-6\">The allegations that form the basis of the commission\u2019s findings of misconduct and recommendation of discipline stem from incidents occurring during eight separate criminal cases over which Judge Moore presided, spanning the years 1994-1997.<footnotemark>4</footnotemark> The commission made the following factual findings in relation to each case.</p>\n<p id=\"b286-7\">A</p>\n<p id=\"b286-8\">Paragraph 18 of the complaint concerns <em>People v White, </em>Recorder\u2019s Court Case No. 94-3885. The defendant in this matter was charged with first-degree murder and possession of a firearm during the commission of a felony.<footnotemark>5</footnotemark> The commission found six instances of misconduct arising from this case.</p>\n<p id=\"b286-9\">First, the commission determined that Judge Moore created sympathy for the victim when, during jury selection, he compared the \u201cviable\u201d defendant with the murder victim, stating:</p>\n<blockquote id=\"b286-10\">Ladies and gentlemen, you are going to to [sic] meet shortly the defendant in this matter. He is a very viable individual. Meaning he is alive and well like you and I. He walks and talks and sleeps and eats and does all of the <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"101\">*101</page-number>other fimction[s] that live human beings are wont to do. However, ladies and gentlemen, it is, there is an allegation that one Ronald Pemberton, Jr.[,] is no longer alive because it is alleged that he was shot to death, I believe, by the defendant premeditatedly, designedly. And obviously, you won\u2019t see or hear him, from him in terms of seeing or hearing from him, ladies and gentlemen.</blockquote>\n<p id=\"b287-5\">Second, in response to a prospective juror\u2019s comments that he was biased against the prosecution because his brother had been convicted of carrying a concealed weapon, Judge Moore asked the juror to explain how he would demonstrate his bias, stating, \u201cHow would you do it? When you leave here, hiss or boo at her [the prosecutor]?\u201d<footnotemark>6</footnotemark> When this juror was dismissed for cause, Judge Moore made the following remark:</p>\n<blockquote id=\"b287-6\">Of course, now, when anybody is out there with a gun and wants to use it, you tell them, come and see brother Nunley [the dismissed prospective juror].. He understands that. He understands you having a gun and putting it to his head.[<footnotemark>7</footnotemark>] I couldn\u2019t quite get with it myself. But different strokes for different folks, I guess.</blockquote>\n<p id=\"b287-7\">Third, the commission found that a hypothetical example given by Judge Moore during jury selection, which named the defendant and was modeled on the facts of the case, improperly encouraged the prospective jurors to find the defendant guilty.</p>\n<p id=\"b288-4\"><page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"102\">*102</page-number>Fourth, the commission found that Judge Moore had commented spontaneously on the defendant\u2019s personal interest in the case and the effect of his interest on his credibility.</p>\n<p id=\"b288-5\">Fifth, the commission determined that Judge Moore had improperly interjected himself into the proceedings in a manner favorable to the prosecution by asserting an objection to the defense counsel\u2019s leading question and criticizing the prosecutor for failing to do so. Further, Judge Moore commented that the defense counsel was asking for conclusions that were really up to the jury to make.</p>\n<p id=\"b288-6\">Sixth, the commission found that Judge Moore unfairly criticized the Court of Appeals during sentencing when he stated in part:</p>\n<blockquote id=\"b288-7\">Because I say, and I am going to put this on whether the Court of Appeals likes it or not. See, Court of Appeals, a lot of you folks up there who are white and middle class, you don\u2019t know. You don\u2019t have relatives who live in the ghetto. You don\u2019t have black relatives who live in the ghetto who are trying to get over who are not that way. So you may think what I am saying, you shouldn\u2019t interject that. I have to, because that is where I come from. That is where I go to. These are the People I talk to.[<footnotemark>8</footnotemark>]</blockquote>\n<p id=\"b288-8\">B</p>\n<p id=\"b288-9\">The two allegations in paragraph 19 of the complaint stem from <em>People v Eklour, </em>Recorder\u2019s Court Case No. 94-4189. The defendant was accused of attempting to defraud an insurance company by <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"103\">*103</page-number>falsely claiming that his business was robbed. The defendant was acquitted.</p>\n<p id=\"b289-5\">The commission determined that Judge Moore would not permit defense counsel to assert objections or make a record and that he made derogatory comments toward counsel in the presence of the jury. Further, the commission found that during a trial recess, when the court was off the record, Judge Moore commented to the prosecutor that the only reason he wanted to cross-examine the witness is because she was not wearing a bra.</p>\n<p id=\"b289-6\">c</p>\n<p id=\"b289-7\">The incidents on which the allegations of paragraph 20 of the complaint were based occurred during <em>People v Payton, </em>Recorder\u2019s Court Case No. 95-006206. The defendant, who was charged with first-degree murder, was acquitted. The commission found six instances of misconduct during this matter.</p>\n<p id=\"b289-8\">First, the commission found that Judge Moore ridiculed a prospective juror, who did not think that he could sit on a jury because he had a difficulty with memory, by mispronouncing the juror\u2019s name and joking with him about whether he could remember his name or where he worked.</p>\n<p id=\"b289-9\">Second, the commission determined that Judge Moore, for no apparent reason, inquired about whether a potential juror used drugs, asking her when she had last \u201csmoked a joint or something.\u201d</p>\n<p id=\"b289-10\">Third, the commission found that Judge Moore had become argumentative with defense counsel after the attorney attempted to explain the basis for a particular line of questioning. Judge Moore instructed coun<page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"104\">*104</page-number>sel that he should not whine and cry, and stated that he sounded like \u201ca little spoiled kid.\u201d The jury was not present when this exchange occurred.</p>\n<p id=\"b290-5\">Fourth, the commission determined that Judge Moore had deferred his role as judge to the prosecutor by inviting the prosecutor to join in a disagreement with defense counsel, asking the prosecutor to explain if he [Judge Moore] was in error some way. This exchange also occurred outside the presence of the jury.</p>\n<p id=\"b290-6\">Fifth, the commission found that Judge Moore made a prosecutorial objection and ordered defense counsel to proceed with another question without permitting defense counsel to respond to the objection or to Judge Moore\u2019s statement concerning another objection asserted by the prosecutor.</p>\n<p id=\"b290-7\">Sixth, the commission determined that after the jury acquitted the defendant, Judge Moore insinuated that he believed that the defendant was culpable, and after the jury was excused, chastised the defendant.</p>\n<p id=\"b290-8\">D</p>\n<p id=\"b290-9\">The allegations set forth in paragraph 21 of the complaint arose during <em>People v Ford, </em>Recorder\u2019s Court Case No. 95-08616. The defendant was charged with arson of a dwelling and as being an habitual offender. He was convicted by the jury.<footnotemark>9</footnotemark> The commission determined that this case gave rise to seven instances of misconduct.</p>\n<p id=\"b291-4\"><page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"105\">*105</page-number>First, Judge Moore made the following comment when a witness from the Detroit Fire Department was excused:</p>\n<blockquote id=\"b291-5\">No, all right. He says he\u2019s finished with you Lieutenant. Thanks for coming. You\u2019re free to leave. Go back and fight some more fires. Don\u2019t do like my man, don\u2019t light no fires, fight your fires.</blockquote>\n<p id=\"b291-6\">Second, the commission found that Judge Moore advised an eight-year-old boy who testified<footnotemark>10</footnotemark> that if anyone should try to chastise him about testifying, he should tell them to see Judge Moore.</p>\n<p id=\"b291-7\">Third, the commission found that Judge Moore objected to defense counsel\u2019s questioning the defendant\u2019s ex-wife about whether she paid rent to the defendant, with whom she lived for a short time, finding the question \u201cirrelevant, incompetent, immaterial.\u201d Fourth, the commission determined that Judge Moore improperly suggested evidence to the jury when he advised the jury, during cross-examination of the defendant\u2019s ex-wife, when school started in 1995. The witness could not recall when school began that year, and Judge Moore stated that his wife was a school teacher and that he believed school began in August of that year. At the end of his explanation, he instructed the jury not to \u201ctake it as testimony.\u201d</p>\n<p id=\"b291-8\">Fifth, the commission found that the following statement, made outside the presence of the jury, indicated that Judge Moore had reached a conclusion about the testimony of a witness and the guilt of the defendant:</p>\n<blockquote id=\"b292-4\"><page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"106\">*106</page-number>Come on. I mean, Jesus, I mean, how did he know what was in the gas can when he stuck the paper in and lit it afire? I mean, for real.</blockquote>\n<p id=\"b292-5\">Sixth, the commission found that after the verdict was rendered, Judge Moore commented three times that the defendant should have entered a plea to avoid requiring his eight-year-old son to testify. Two of these comments were made in the presence of the jury, and one was made after the jury was excused.</p>\n<p id=\"b292-6\">Seventh, the commission found that Judge Moore berated the defendant during sentencing, calling him a \u201clow life,\u201d \u201ca despicable person,\u201d and the \u201cmeanest man\u201d he had seen all year.</p>\n<p id=\"b292-7\">E</p>\n<p id=\"b292-8\">Paragraph 22 of the complaint concerned <em>People v Anderson, </em>Recorder\u2019s Court Case No. 95-012333. The defendant was charged with first-degree murder and felony-murder. The jury convicted the defendant of second-degree murder.<footnotemark>11</footnotemark> The commission determined that four instances of misconduct occurred during this case.</p>\n<p id=\"b292-9\">First, the commission found that during voir dire, Judge Moore discoursed about how \u201cugly people\u201d are not liked and how being \u201ccute\u201d helps you get along in the world.</p>\n<p id=\"b293-4\"><page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"107\">*107</page-number>Second, the commission found that during voir dire, Judge Moore commented that an insurance company must be \u201cout of their sick mind\u201d for refusing to provide coverage. This comment was made in response to explanation from a potential juror who had been a victim of a crime that the crime was not prosecuted because of a lack of evidence and that insurance would not provide coverage.</p>\n<p id=\"b293-5\">Third, the commission determined that Judge Moore spontaneously asserted an objection and summarized the prior testimony of a witness. Judge Moore failed to acknowledge defense counsel's point that it was the prosecutor\u2019s role to object and then proceeded to question the witness.</p>\n<p id=\"b293-6\">Fourth, the commission found that the following exchange, which occurred between Judge Moore and the defendant\u2019s girlfriend when he addressed her regarding her improper discussions with two jurors, was misconduct:</p>\n<blockquote id=\"b293-7\"><em>The </em>Court: Come on out here. Now, listen. You may think you all cute and everything because you\u2019re not cute worth a rip of anything.</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b293-8\">I\u2019m going to send you home and I\u2019m not going to allow you back.</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b293-9\">Look at me.</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b293-10\">You understand that?</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b293-11\"><em>Ms. Smith: </em>Yes.</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b293-12\"><em>The Court: </em>How old are you?</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b293-13\">Ms. <em>Smith: </em>Nineteen.</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b293-14\"><em>The Court: </em>Nineteen. Well, you take you and them 19 years and you-how many babies you got without a husband?</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b293-15\">Ms. <em>Smith: </em>One.</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b293-16\"><em>The Court: </em>Well, take your 19 years and that one baby and you stay at home.</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b294-5\"><page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"108\">*108</page-number>I don\u2019t want you down here tomorrow, you understand. You show up here tomorrow and you\u2019re going to spend the rest of the 29 days in jail.</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b294-6\">You look at me.</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b294-7\">You understand what I\u2019m saying?</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b294-8\"><em>Ms. Smith: </em>Yes.</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b294-9\"><em>The Court: </em>You think I\u2019m kidding with you?</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b294-10\"><em>Ms. Smith: </em>No.</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b294-11\"><em>The Court: </em>Yes. And if you say anything to anybody, if you stand out front, if I see you anywhere around this courtroom \u2014 look at me \u2014 you will be going to jail.</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b294-12\">You understand that?</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b294-13\"><em>Ms. Smith: </em>Yes.</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b294-14\"><em>The Court: </em>If you want to know what the verdict is, you call back here.</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b294-15\">Now, you go home.</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b294-16\">Give her her Social Security Card.</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b294-17\"><em>Ms. Smith: </em>Thank you.</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b294-18\"><em>The Court: </em>Only thing she ever had with her name typed on it probably besides a welfare check probably.</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b294-19\"><em>Ms. Smith: </em>I work.</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b294-20\"><em>The Court: </em>I know you work.</blockquote>\n<p id=\"b294-21\">F</p>\n<p id=\"b294-22\"><em>People v Holmes, </em>Recorder\u2019s Court Case No. 96-00101, formed the basis for the allegations in paragraph 23 of the complaint. The defendant was charged with two counts of armed robbery and two counts of felony-firearm and was convicted on all counts.<footnotemark>12</footnotemark> The commission made six findings of misconduct in relation to this case.</p>\n<p id=\"b295-4\"><page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"109\">*109</page-number>First, the commission found that Judge Moore excessively interfered and improperly questioned witnesses to the detriment of the defense.</p>\n<p id=\"b295-5\">Second, the commission determined that Judge Moore made various objections to defense counsel\u2019s questioning of witnesses throughout the trial.</p>\n<p id=\"b295-6\">Third, the commission found that on three occasions, Judge Moore interrupted the examination of witnesses and summarized testimony on his own initiative.</p>\n<p id=\"b295-7\">Fourth, the commission found that Judge Moore was argumentative with defense counsel and that he prohibited both the prosecutor and defense counsel from addressing certain issues. Further, he was abusive and sarcastic toward counsel.</p>\n<p id=\"b295-8\">Fifth, the commission determined that Judge Moore made inappropriate remarks concerning the Detroit Free Press and other judges from the Recorder\u2019s Court. In response to a juror\u2019s question whether Judge Moore had read an article on someone Judge Moore had mentioned, Judge Moore responded that he did not \u201cread the scab rag, I haven\u2019t read it since they went on strike.\u201d In explaining the reason for a brief delay, Judge Moore stated:</p>\n<blockquote id=\"b295-9\">And we\u2019re happy to have you back again. Again, I apologize for the 15 minutes or so delay, but we\u2019re still in the picture-taking. We take individual pictures, we take individual things, we take group pictures, and there\u2019s nothing like getting .... Getting all judges together is like getting the United Nations together, everybody\u2019s a king, you know what I mean, and nobody tells the king what to do. And <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"110\">*110</page-number>especially if they\u2019re queens. What do you mean? Would you .... And don\u2019t mess with these queens, you talk about stinging you to death. Anyway so I apologize once again.</blockquote>\n<p id=\"b296-6\">Sixth, the commission found that at sentencing, Judge Moore made stereotypical comments on the basis of race:</p>\n<blockquote id=\"b296-7\">I mean, there were two women who identified him pretty good and their circumstances led right on down to getting him. This is not some white women out there who think that all black men look alike or Chinese women. They are black women who got a good look at him while he was poking his gun at 'em and taking their coats and so forth, and so there\u2019s no . . . they do not seem to have any kind of special grievance against your client.</blockquote>\n<p id=\"b296-8\">G</p>\n<p id=\"b296-9\">The allegations in paragraph 24 of the complaint were based on Judge Moore\u2019s conduct during <em>People v Johnson </em>and <em>Brock, </em>Wayne Circuit Court, Criminal Division Case No. 97-03614. Each defendant was charged with assault with intent to rob while armed and felony-firearm. Defendant Johnson was also charged with assault with intent to commit murder.<footnotemark>13</footnotemark> The commission made eight findings of misconduct in this case.</p>\n<p id=\"b296-10\">First, the commission found that Judge Moore questioned witnesses in a manner favorable to the <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"111\">*111</page-number>prosecution. Judge Moore interrupted defense counsel\u2019s questioning of a witness concerning lineup procedures and then discussed the difference between refreshed recollection and past recollection recorded for the benefit of some students who were observing the trial. Further, Judge Moore interrupted defense counsel and questioned a witness regarding the reading of rights to defendant Brock.</p>\n<p id=\"b297-5\">Second, the commission determined that Judge Moore made objections during defense counsel\u2019s questioning of witnesses, summarized prior testimony of a witness, and discussed the anticipated testimony of other witnesses.</p>\n<p id=\"b297-6\">Third, the commission found that Judge Moore improperly limited defense counsels\u2019 presentation of their case by summarily determining that the anticipated testimony of a witness they wished to call was not relevant to the trial and prohibiting the witness from being called. The commission believed that this action indicated that Judge Moore \u201cwas more concerned with the length of the trial than with providing defense counsel with a full opportunity to present its case.\u201d</p>\n<p id=\"b297-7\">Fourth, the commission determined that Judge Moore made an abusive remark to counsel when he stated that the attorneys sounded like \u201ca bunch of old women,\u201d who didn\u2019t know the Rules of Evidence.</p>\n<p id=\"b297-8\">Fifth, the commission found that Judge Moore summarized the subject matter of the testimony that he believed the attorneys intended to pursue and berated counsel rather than discussing the necessity of the anticipated testimony.</p>\n<p id=\"b297-9\">Sixth, the commission determined that Judge Moore raised his voice at defendant Johnson while he <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"112\">*112</page-number>was testifying. The following exchange ensued when defense counsel objected:</p>\n<blockquote id=\"b298-6\"><em>Mr. Lusby (defense counsel): </em>Excuse me, Your Honor.</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b298-7\"><em>The Court: </em>Yes, what is it sir?</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b298-8\"><em>Mr. Lusby: </em>My objection really goes to the Court, inadvertently I assume, but, you know, my client . . .</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b298-9\"><em>The Court: </em>What?</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b298-10\"><em>Mr. Lusby: </em>Raised your voice at my client.</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b298-11\"><em>The Court: </em>I\u2019m a raise voice person, sir.</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b298-12\"><em>Mr. Lusby: </em>Judge, I understand that.</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b298-13\"><em>The Court: </em>Well, fine, sir. I\u2019m not telling him to do anything wrong. I\u2019m just telling him to realize ....</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b298-14\">Listen, I want to get this case over with, gentlemen.</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b298-15\"><em>Mr. Lusby: </em>Judge, listen to yourself now, please.</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b298-16\"><em>The Court: </em>I\u2019m listening to myself and I\u2019m listening to you too.</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b298-17\"><em>Mr. Lusby: </em>Okay, okay.</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b298-18\"><em>The Court: </em>Just want to get this case over.</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b298-19\"><em>Mr. Lusby: </em>Okay.</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b298-20\"><em>The Court: </em>You can scream all you want. Now you gonna cry Sit down, Mr. Lusby.</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b298-21\"><em>Mr. Lusby: </em>I need some water.</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b298-22\"><em>The Court: </em>I can\u2019t believe this. Crying. Ask your question, sir. Let him get his water.</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b298-23\">Sir, listen to the question. Answer the question that is asked of you, please, so we can get on with this case. Carry on, Mr. Prosecutor.</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b298-24\">Now, I\u2019m gonna tell you something, Ladies and Gentlemen, and I want you .... If you think that I am screaming and hollering, whatever, then you note it. Part of this, see, is to build this record so that when it goes to the Court of Appeals, if it ever gets there, gonna say well, Judge, you sat there screaming at my client. I don\u2019t believe I\u2019ve talked to this man any different than I\u2019ve talked to anyone else. If so, you tell me, have I? Have I talked to this man any different than I have? Well, that\u2019s my intent is not to talk to him any different than anybody else. Just get this case over with.</blockquote>\n<p id=\"b299-4\"><page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"113\">*113</page-number>Seventh, the commission determined that the following exchange occurred between Judge Moore and defendant Brock\u2019s father, who was a Detroit police officer, when Mr. Brock left the courtroom during sentencing:</p>\n<blockquote id=\"b299-5\"><em>The Court: </em>Listen, Lieutenant .... Hey, tell him to come back here. Your father can think whatever he wants about it. He can jump up and do whatever he wants there if he doesn\u2019t like it. I don\u2019t like his attitude. Just because he ... . That\u2019s part of tire problem that\u2019s involved. Go out there, tell \u2018em if he\u2019s out there, tell \u2018em I\u2019m ordering him as a police officer to come back in here.</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b299-6\">* * *</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b299-7\">Sir, you have a seat here, lieutenant, or whatever rank you are. I don\u2019t like your attitude, sir. You as an officer, you are a police officer, sir, you come into this court, you treat this court with respect. You understand me, sir? Stand up, sir, stand up. You understand me?</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b299-8\"><em>Mr. Brock: </em>Yes, sir.</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b299-9\"><em>The Court: </em>Well, now you walk out of here. I didn\u2019t create this situation. I don\u2019t know if you did or not. He\u2019s been your son all your life. All I know is that the jury .... He had a good trial with a good lawyer and a good verdict, sir, and he\u2019s going to jail. And I don\u2019t need to have your arrogance, sir.</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b299-10\"><em>Mr. Brock: </em>Do I have a right to walk out?</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b299-11\"><em>The Court: </em>You have a right to walk out of here, sir. But you have a right also, you, sir, have to respect this Court of all people.</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b299-12\"><em>Mr. Brock: </em>I respect the Court.</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b299-13\"><em>The Court: </em>Okay then. You just leave here with the respect that you deserve this court. And I don\u2019t need any of your side glances either, sir. You took care of \u2018em all your life. If he\u2019s bad, it\u2019s your problem.</blockquote>\n<p id=\"b299-14\">Eighth, the commission found that Judge Moore was also abusive when he sentenced defendant <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"114\">*114</page-number>Johnson during a separate proceeding immediately thereafter.</p>\n<p id=\"b300-5\">H</p>\n<p id=\"b300-6\">The allegations contained in paragraph 25 of the complaint were based on <em>People v Turner, </em>Wayne Circuit Court, Criminal Division Case No. 97-2664. The defendant was charged with attempted home invasion and as an habitual offender. He chose to represent himself during trial, with his appointed attorney available to act as his legal advisor. The jury convicted the defendant.<footnotemark>14</footnotemark> The commission made eleven findings of misconduct in this matter.</p>\n<p id=\"b300-7\">The first five findings of the commission concern threats made by Judge Moore to gag the defendant and his ordering defendant to be gagged with tape at various points during the trial.</p>\n<p id=\"b300-8\">Next, the commission found that during the pretrial conference, Judge Moore made disparaging remarks to the defendant when he inquired about obtaining relief because he had been imprisoned since March. Judge Moore stated:</p>\n<blockquote id=\"b300-9\">What kind of relief? You better go over there and get you an aspirin or Alka Seltzer or maybe some Kaopectate \u2018cause that\u2019s the only relief you\u2019re getting. We\u2019ll see you when you get back here the 13th.</blockquote>\n<p id=\"b300-10\">Third, the commission found that Judge Moore insulted the defendant when the defendant offered to <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"115\">*115</page-number>hand him the questions he had mapped out by replying, \u201cI don\u2019t need you to hand me anything, diddley boy. My boy, just read what you have.\u201d</p>\n<p id=\"b301-5\">Fourth, the commission determined that Judge Moore almost immediately thereafter made another derogatory remark, directing the defendant to shut up and telling him that he had \u201cdiarrhea of the mouth.\u201d</p>\n<p id=\"b301-6\">Fifth, the commission found that Judge Moore directed other derogatory remarks toward defendant, calling him a \u201clow life\u201d and a \u201crat,\u201d and inferring that the defendant knew how to commit break-ins by commenting, \u201cWhy don\u2019t you [defendant] ask a question. You know a lot more about it apparently than some of the rest of us\u201d<footnotemark>15</footnotemark> when the defendant attempted to question complainant about pulling iron bars off a window.</p>\n<p id=\"b301-7\">Sixth, the commission found that Judge Moore frequently interjected during the defendant\u2019s presentation of his defense, displaying an antidefense sentiment with his abrasive manner and repeated interruptions.</p>\n<p id=\"b301-8\">Seventh, the commission determined that Judge Moore took over the questioning concerning the location of the crime.</p>\n<p id=\"b301-9\">Eighth, the commission determined that Judge Moore instructed the prosecutor to object.</p>\n<p id=\"b301-10\">n</p>\n<p id=\"b301-11\">The commission made the following conclusions of law, stating that the conduct identified in its findings <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"116\">*116</page-number>of fact, individually and collectively, constituted one or more of the following:</p>\n<blockquote id=\"b302-6\">(1) Misconduct in office, as defined by the Michigan Constitution of 1963, as amended, Art. 6, \u00a7 30, and MCR 9.205;</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b302-7\">(2) Conduct clearly prejudicial to the administration of justice, as defined by the Michigan Constitution of 1963, as amended, Art. 6, \u00a7 30, and MCR 9.205(C)(4);</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b302-8\">(3) A persistent incompetence or neglectfulness in the performance of judicial duties, contrary to MCR 9.205(C)(5);</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b302-9\">(4) A persistent failure to treat persons fairly with courtesy and respect[,] pursuant to MCR 9.205(C)(6);</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b302-10\">(5) Treatment of persons unfairly, discourteously, or disrespectfully because of race, gender or other protected personal characteristic, contrary to MCR 9.205(C)(7);</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b302-11\">(6) A failure to observe high standards of conduct so that the integrity and independence of the judiciary may be preserved, contrary to the Code of Judicial Conduct, Canon 1;</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b302-12\">(7) Conduct involving impropriety and the appearance of impropriety, thereby eroding public confidence in the judiciary, in violation of the Code of Judicial Conduct, Canon 2A;</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b302-13\">(8) A failure to respect and observe the law and to conduct oneself at all times in a manner which would enhance the public\u2019s confidence in the integrity and impartiality of the judiciary, contrary to the Code of Judicial Conduct, Canon 2B;</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b302-14\">(9) A failure to be patient, dignified and courteous to a juror, in violation of the Code of Judicial Conduct, Canon 3A(3);</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b302-15\">(10) A failure to be patient, dignified and courteous to litigants, lawyers and others with whom Respondent dealt in an official capacity, contrary to the Code of Judicial Conduct, Canon 3A(3);</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b302-16\">(11) Undue interference, impatience and participation in the examination of witnesses; demonstrating a severe attitude toward witnesses; tending to prevent proper presentation of the cause and ascertainment of the truth; failure to <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"117\">*117</page-number>avoid a controversial manner and tone in addressing counsel, litigants and witnesses; failing to avoid interruptions of counsel in their arguments; and reaching a premature judgement, in violation of the Code of Judicial Conduct, Canon 3A(8);</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b303-5\">(12) Non-adherence to the usual and accepted methods of doing justice, contrary to the Code of Judicial Conduct, Canon 3A(9); and</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b303-6\">(13) Failure to treat every person fairly, with courtesy and respect, without regard to a person\u2019s race, gender or other protected personal characteristic, contrary to the Code of Judicial Conduct, Canons 2B and 3A(10).</blockquote>\n<p id=\"b303-7\">in</p>\n<p id=\"b303-8\">The commission recommended that Judge Moore be suspended for nine months without pay. The commission explained that this recommendation was based on the collective acts of Judge Moore throughout his judicial career, noting that he had received two admonitions and a public censure.<footnotemark>16</footnotemark> The first admonition, which was issued May 22, 1986, arose from five criminal proceedings. Judge Moore was admonished for \u201cdisplaying obvious sarcasm,\u201d demonstrating \u201ca predisposition [for] the guilt of the defendants,\u201d \u201cinappropriately expressing sympathy for complainants in criminal cases,\u201d \u201cdisparaging\u201d defense <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"118\">*118</page-number>counsel and denigrating an attorney\u2019s professional ability, and improperly treating a witness with \u201cdiscourtesy, impatience, and a severe attitude.\u201d Judge Moore was again admonished on September 7, 1989, for having a private conversation with a police detective during a trial in which the detective was a witness. Judge Moore was publically censured in 1995 for causing a disturbance in the Chief Judge\u2019s courtroom while the Chief Judge was conducting a court proceeding. Further, the commission noted that Judge Moore had been reversed or criticized on appeal numerous times for his conduct.<footnotemark>17</footnotemark></p>\n<p id=\"b304-5\">While discussing the standards to be considered in making a recommendation for discipline, the commission noted that the purpose of judicial discipline is not to punish but to maintain the integrity of the judicial process. The commission then examined the factors from <em>In re Deming</em><footnotemark><em>18</em></footnotemark><em> </em>that this Court cited in its order in <em>In re </em>Brown<footnotemark>19</footnotemark> and applied them to the present case.<footnotemark>20</footnotemark> Considering each factor, the commission stated as follows:</p>\n<blockquote id=\"b305-3\"><page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"119\">*119</page-number>(a) Respondent\u2019s misconduct is not an isolated instance. It represents a pattern of misconduct continuing throughout Respondent\u2019s career and resulting in admonitions, public censure, and repeated criticisms and reversals by reviewing courts. Respondent was warned repeatedly that his conduct was improper. He cannot justifiably assert ignorance of the error of his ways. He has failed to acknowledge the criticisms were valid and has failed to alter conduct.</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b305-5\">(b) Respondent\u2019s egregious conduct included abusive, berating, and sarcastic remarks; excessive interjections and interference in trial proceedings; assuming a prosecutorial role; expressing pro-prosecutorial and anti-defense sentiment; prejudicing juries; and lack of judicial demeanor. The improper acts were frequent, as reflected by the numerous cases cited in the attached appendix. In some instances, his conduct directly resulted in reversals of convictions of criminal defendants, although as the Court of Appeals specifically noted, there was sufficient, strong, or even overwhelming evidence of a defendant\u2019s guilt. <em>People v Williams, </em>Michigan Court of Appeals Docket Number 83920, April 16, 1986; <em>People v Lippett, </em>Michigan Court of Appeals Docket Number 153716, March 23, 1994; <em>People v Ford, </em>Michigan Court of Appeals Docket Number 195964, December 1, 1998.</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b305-6\">(c) All incidents of misconduct in the present complaint, except one, occurred in the courtroom while court was in session. The exception occurred in the courtroom during a recess when a few individuals were present. Many incidents were in the presence of the jury.</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b305-7\">(d) All acts of misconduct occurred in his official capacity and not in his private life. Therefore, all acts were open to public view.</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b305-8\">(e) Except for the comment concerning a witness who supposedly was not wearing a bra, Respondent does not dispute the underlying facts. Respondent has repeatedly denied that any of the acts constitute misconduct. With the <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"120\">*120</page-number>benefit of hindsight, Respondent acknowledged at the Formal Hearing on March 13, 2000, that a few of his comments could or possibly should have been worded differently.</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b306-6\">(f) Respondent has made no noticeable effort to change or modify his conduct. He received warnings from the Commission and the Court of Appeals and has ignored them. Respondent once expressed a desire to avoid having the Examiner, or the Commission, \u201ccoming back at\u201d him and \u201cto avoid a problem\u201d in the future. However, he denied that the specific conduct that was the subject of his statement was \u201cwrong. ...\u201d</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b306-7\">The Commission acknowledges that, in his sanctions brief, Respondent expressed regret. He admits that several of his comments \u201cwere inappropriate or ill timed or spoken without thinking, or at the very least, in the limited context presented, do now upon reading or hearing appear to be unacceptable.\u201d For those statements he made a \u201cheartfelt and sincere apology.\u201d The Commission notes this attempt at damage control follows a finding that Respondent had engaged in serious and continued acts of misconduct.</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b306-8\">(g) Respondent has served on the bench for approximately 20 years. Considering his experience and frequent criticisms and reprimands, he should know the requisite standards. He has failed to adhere to the directives of the Commission or alter his conduct in response to criticisms by reviewing courts. Respondent has repeatedly violated those standards.</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b306-9\">(h) There have been many prior complaints regarding Respondent as reflected in prior disciplinary proceedings and appellate criticism detailed above.</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b306-10\">(i) Respondent\u2019s conduct has tainted the integrity of and respect for the judiciary. His abusive comments and demeaning nature have a great negative impact upon members of the public with infrequent exposure to the courts. That other judges typically strive to maintain an unbiased, professional, courteous and dignified manner while on the bench is lost to those whose experience is limited to encounters with Respondent in his courtroom.</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b306-11\">(j) There is no charge that Respondent abused his office for personal gain or to satisfy personal desires.</blockquote>\n<p id=\"b307-4\"><page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"121\">*121</page-number>The commission then considered the mitigating and aggravating factors in reaching its recommendation. In addressing the mitigating factors, it noted that Judge Moore had been a \u201cdiligent jurist during his 20 years on the bench\u201d and recognized that he often means well. Farther, it noted that he had been transferred to the civil division, where he would likely encounter \u201cfewer examples of the darker side of human conduct.\u201d In considering aggravating factors, the commission stated that Judge Moore \u201cfrequently has failed to distinguish his role as an impartial arbitrator with that of a <em>quasi </em>social worker and partisan advocate.\u201d Because no previous discipline, criticism, or reversal by a higher court had altered his conduct in any way, and because he had occasionally expressed disdain for the commission and the Court of Appeals, the commission opined that a significant sanction was required.</p>\n<p id=\"b307-5\">IV</p>\n<p id=\"b307-6\">The Michigan Constitution provides:</p>\n<blockquote id=\"b307-7\">On recommendation of the judicial tenure commission, the supreme court may censure, suspend with or without salary, retire or remove a judge for a conviction of a felony, physical or mental disability which prevents the performance of judicial duties, misconduct in office, persistent failure to perform his duties, habitual intemperance or conduct that is clearly prejudicial to the administration of justice.

[MCR 9.225.]</blockquote>\n<p id=\"b308-6\">In reviewing the record de novo, we consider whether the conduct charged and found by the commission is established by the record, whether the conduct is of a nature warranting discipline, and whether the discipline recommended by the commission or some other form of discipline should be imposed. <em>In re Seitz, </em>441 Mich 590, 594; 495 NW2d 559 (1993).</p>\n<p id=\"b308-7\">MCR 9.205(A) provides that a \u201cjudge is personally responsible for his or her own behavior and for the proper conduct and administration of the court in which he or she presides.\u201d Further, a judge is guilty of misconduct in office if:</p>\n<blockquote id=\"b308-8\">(1) the judge is convicted in the United States of conduct which is punishable as a felony under the laws of Michigan or federal law;</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b308-9\">(2) the judge persistently fails to perform judicial duties;</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b308-10\">(3) the judge is habitually intemperate within the meaning of Const 1963, art 6, \u00a7 30;</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b308-11\">(4) the judge\u2019s conduct is clearly prejudicial to the administration of justice;</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b308-12\">(5) the judge is persistently incompetent or neglectful in the performance of judicial duties;</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b308-13\">(6) the judge persistently fails to treat persons fairly, with courtesy and respect; or</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b308-14\">(7) the judge treats a person unfairly, discourteously, or disrespectfully because of the person\u2019s race, gender, or other protected personal characteristic.

The question in every case is whether the conduct complained of constitutes misconduct in office, conduct that is clearly prejudicial to the administration of justice, or another ground of discipline listed in Const 1963, art 6, \u00a7 30, not whether a particular canon or disciplinary rule has been violated. All the circumstances are to be considered in deciding whether action by the commission is warranted. [MCR 9.205(E).]</blockquote>\n<p id=\"b309-5\">V</p>\n<p id=\"b309-6\">Judge Moore filed a petition to reject or modify the commission\u2019s recommendation, arguing that the commission\u2019s findings of fact and conclusions of law were against the great weight of the evidence, that the commission erred in failing to dismiss the formal complaint, and that he was denied procedural due process by the examiner and the commission. We will address each argument in turn.</p>\n<p id=\"b309-7\">A</p>\n<p id=\"b309-8\">Judge Moore first argues that the commission\u2019s findings of fact and conclusions of law are contrary to the great weight of the evidence. Specifically, Judge Moore disputes that there was any evidence to support the commission\u2019s finding in <em>Eklour </em>that he had commented that the only reason the prosecution wanted to cross-examine a witness was because she was not wearing a bra. We disagree.</p>\n<p id=\"b310-4\"><page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"124\">*124</page-number>Three witnesses were called during the hearing before the commission to testify concerning this matter: Corrine Shoop, George Serkian, and John Bianco. Ms. Shoop, who was an attorney representing the insurance company the defendant was accused of defrauding, attended the criminal trial. She testified that during a break in the trial, she heard Judge Moore remark to the prosecutor, John Bianco, that the only reason that the prosecutor wanted to cross-examine the witness was because she was not wearing a bra and that Judge Moore was joking and laughing when he made the remark. She further testified that she did not believe that there was anyone in the courtroom when the remark was made besides herself, Mr. Bianco, Judge Moore, and perhaps, a Wayne County sheriff. She stated that she believed that she discussed the comment with Mr. Bianco. She also filed a grievance with the commission concerning the remark.<footnotemark>21</footnotemark></p>\n<p id=\"b310-5\">George Serkian represented defendant Eklour during the criminal trial before Judge Moore. He testified that he did not hear Judge Moore make the remark. When asked whether he was in the courtroom during the recess in which the remark was made, he responded that if the prosecutor was in the courtroom, he was in the courtroom. He testified that this representation was based on both his policy of always being in the courtroom when the prosecutor is present and his memory. However, he acknowledged that when he met with the examiner, he indicated that he had no present recollection of some of the <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"125\">*125</page-number>specific things from the trial about which he was asked during the meeting.</p>\n<p id=\"b311-5\">John Bianco, the prosecutor who tried the <em>Eklour </em>matter, testified that he \u201cabsolutely did not hear that comment.\u201d He further stated that he had some vague recollection of Ms. Shoop being upset about something that she thought the judge had said, but he could not recall any specifics regarding her concern or their conversation. He vaguely remembered making a motion to recall the witness.</p>\n<p id=\"b311-6\">Having reviewed the testimony, we cannot find any fault with the commission\u2019s implicit determination that Ms. Shoop\u2019s testimony was the most credible. Consequently, its finding that Judge Moore made this remark was not against the great weight of the evidence.</p>\n<p id=\"b311-7\">B</p>\n<p id=\"b311-8\">Judge Moore next argues that the preponderance of the evidence fails to support a finding that his comments and participation in the eight trials constituted misconduct or conduct prejudicial to the administration of justice and that the commission erred in failing to dismiss the formal complaint. Judge Moore alleges that the commission failed to review the incidents within the full context of the trial proceedings and that his statements, comments, and questions are taken out of context. We agree that the larger context of a few of the remarks calls the commission\u2019s findings concerning these remarks into question. However, we disagree that the complaint should have been dismissed because there is sufficient evidence to <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"126\">*126</page-number>sustain the commission\u2019s remaining findings of misconduct.</p>\n<p id=\"b312-5\">Two of the findings that are questionable stemmed from <em>People v White.</em><footnotemark><em>22</em></footnotemark><em> </em>The commission found that Judge Moore committed misconduct during jury selection by giving a hypothetical example that named the defendant and was modeled on the facts of the case. We think it important to note that this example occurred during the trial court\u2019s attempt to distinguish between the quality and quantity of evidence and an extended discussion concerning whether the jurors would be able to convict or acquit on the basis of one witness\u2019 testimony or ten witnesses\u2019 testimony. While the trial court could have more carefully and effectively made this point, we do not believe that the example, when considered within the context in which it was made, improperly encouraged the prospective jurors to find the defendant guilty.</p>\n<p id=\"b312-6\">The commission also determined that Judge Moore had spontaneously commented on the defendant\u2019s personal interest in the case and the effect it would have on his credibility. This comment was made during the preliminary instructions to the jury, as Judge Moore was explaining how to judge the weight and credibility of the witnesses\u2019 testimony. We disagree with the commission\u2019s characterization of this remark as a \u201cspontaneousf]\u201d comment on the defendant\u2019s personal interest in this case and do not find that it constituted misconduct.</p>\n<p id=\"b313-4\"><page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"127\">*127</page-number>Another finding that we believe is questionable is the commission\u2019s determination that in <em>People v Payton, </em>Judge Moore improperly deferred his role as judge to the prosecutor by asking the prosecutor if he was in error in some way. See part n(c). This remark was made during a discussion of whether one could impeach a witness with something the witness did not mention in an earlier statement. At the beginning of this discussion, Judge Moore asked both defense counsel and the prosecutor to correct him if he was wrong. In the midst of the discussion, he asked defense counsel to tell him if he was wrong. Further, it appears that defense counsel may have partially prevailed in his argument because he was permitted to question the witness about an \u201cunknown man\u201d mentioned in his statement. Therefore, we disagree that this remark constituted an instance of improperly deferring to the prosecution.</p>\n<p id=\"b313-5\">The last finding that we question is the commission\u2019s determination that Judge Moore committed misconduct by advising the eight-year-old witness who testified that if anyone gave him difficulties about testifying, he should refer that person to Judge Moore.<footnotemark>23</footnotemark> While, in the future, Judge Moore should be cognizant of the impression that such actions might give the jury, we find that Judge Moore\u2019s conduct in this instance was motivated by his concern for a young child required to testify against his father concerning a crime the father committed against the child\u2019s mother. Therefore, we do not consider these <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"128\">*128</page-number>actions to be misconduct for which Judge Moore should be sanctioned.</p>\n<p id=\"b314-5\">Apart from these specific findings that we question, we hold that there is sufficient evidence to support the remaining findings of fact made by the commission. Therefore, the commission did not err in failing to dismiss the formal complaint.</p>\n<p id=\"b314-6\">c</p>\n<p id=\"b314-7\">Judge Moore also argues that he was denied procedural due process by the examiner and the commission. This argument is premised on five separate allegations.<footnotemark>24</footnotemark></p>\n<p id=\"b314-8\">First, Judge Moore contends that he was denied due process by the examiner\u2019s unsolicited and premature filing of a sanctions brief. We determine that this argument is without merit. There is nothing to suggest that the receipt of the sanctions brief before the commission\u2019s decision regarding misconduct improperly influenced the commission in any way. Further, while the commission and Judge Moore agreed to dismiss many of the allegations in the complaint and proceed on the remaining allegations, these other matters were certainly relevant to determining the appropriate sanction to be awarded upon a finding of misconduct.</p>\n<p id=\"b314-9\">Second, Judge Moore asserts that he was denied due process by the commission\u2019s failure to consider any of the eight underlying criminal jury trial transcripts as a whole. We find that this argument is also <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"129\">*129</page-number>without merit. While we disagree with a few of the commission\u2019s findings because of the context of the remarks, the complete transcripts from all eight trials were part of the record considered by the commission.</p>\n<p id=\"b315-5\">Third, Judge Moore argues that he was denied due process by the commission\u2019s failure to limit the issues considered to those delineated in the November 1999 agreement. Specifically, Judge Moore challenges the references to appellate cases that have criticized Judge Moore because he had no opportunity to address or refute these other cases. We disagree that defendant was denied due process by the consideration of these cases in the determination of the appropriate sanction. Several of the factors we have identified as relevant in making a recommendation of discipline refer to previous conduct on the part of the judge, including whether the conduct is an isolated incident or part of a pattern; the nature, extent, and frequency of the conduct, whether there have been prior complaints about the judge, and whether the judge has demonstrated an effort to modify his conduct. <em>In re Deming, </em>108 Wash 2d 82, 119-120; 736 P2d 639 (1987). The commission therefore appropriately considered these relevant prior matters in its sanction determination. Nothing in the November 1999 agreement between the examiner and Judge Moore prohibited consideration of those matters for purposes of determining the sanction.</p>\n<p id=\"b315-6\">The commission\u2019s findings of fact do not support Judge Moore\u2019s claim that the misconduct determination was contaminated by consideration of matters outside the complaint in violation of the November 1999 agreement. The commission\u2019s findings of fact <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"130\">*130</page-number>provide adequate support for both the finding of misconduct and for the sanction we impose, without taking into account the prior extraneous matters.</p>\n<p id=\"b316-5\">Fourth, Judge Moore contends that he was denied due process by Judge William Murphy\u2019s participation in the commission proceedings because Judge Murphy was a member of the Court of Appeals panel that decided <em>People v Johnson, </em>one of the eight criminal cases upon which the findings of misconduct in the present matter are based.<footnotemark>25</footnotemark> The <em>Johnson </em>decision was issued on July 21, 2000, three days after the commission issued its decision regarding misconduct. We note that paragraph one of the agreement entered into by the parties specifically provided:</p>\n<blockquote id=\"b316-6\">The Examiner and Respondent, through his counsel, shall stipulate and request that any members of the Commission who may have previously recused themselves from participating in any discussion or decision-making relating to Formal Complaint No. 58 be relieved of such recusal and hereinafter participate and vote on all matters. The Commission\u2019s Decision shall be made pursuant to MCR 9.221.</blockquote>\n<p id=\"b316-7\">Pursuant to this provision, Judge Moore consented to the participation of all members in all matters. Therefore, we hold that Judge Moore was not denied due process by Judge Murphy\u2019s participation in the proceedings.</p>\n<p id=\"b316-8\">Fifth, Judge Moore contends that he was denied due process by the examiner\u2019s attempt to solicit other claims or grievances against him by way of a letter mailed to an unknown number of members of the <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"131\">*131</page-number>criminal appellate bar. The commission granted Judge Moore\u2019s motion to restrain the examiner from soliciting claims and ruled that the examiner would not be permitted to utilize any of that information during the hearing.<footnotemark>26</footnotemark> Therefore, we conclude that Judge Moore was not denied due process.</p>\n<p id=\"b317-5\">VI</p>\n<p id=\"b317-6\">Having, in our review of Judge Moore\u2019s arguments, primarily addressed whether the commission\u2019s factual findings are supported by the record, we now consider whether the conduct is of a nature warranting discipline and, if so, what level of discipline should be imposed.</p>\n<p id=\"b317-7\">A</p>\n<p id=\"b317-8\">The commission determined that Judge Moore\u2019s conduct violated numerous provisions of the court rules and Code of Judicial Conduct. We agree with some, but not all, of the Judicial Tenure Commission\u2019s conclusions of law. In particular we disagree that Judge Moore\u2019s conduct constituted \u201cpersistent incompetence [and] neglectfulness.\u201d</p>\n<p id=\"b317-9\">Specifically, the Code of Judicial Conduct provides that \u201c[a]t all times, the conduct and manner of a judge should promote public confidence in the integrity and impartiality of the judiciary\u201d and that \u201ca judge should treat every person fairly, with courtesy and respect.\u201d Canon 2(B). Further, \u201c[a] judge should be patient, dignified, and courteous to litigants, jurors, witnesses, <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"132\">*132</page-number>lawyers, and others with whom the judge deals in an official capacity . . . Canon 3(A)(3). Additionally, Canon 3(A)(8) provides:</p>\n<blockquote id=\"b318-6\">A judge may properly intervene in a trial of a case to promote expedition, and prevent unnecessary waste of time, or to clear up some obscurity, but the judge should bear in mind that undue interference, impatience, or participation in the examination of witnesses, or a severe attitude on the judge\u2019s part toward witnesses, especially those who are excited or terrified by the unusual circumstances of a trial, may tend to prevent the proper presentation of the cause, or the ascertainment of truth in respect thereto.</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b318-7\">Conversation between the judge and counsel in court is often necessary, but the judge should be studious to avoid controversies that are apt to obscure the merits of the dispute between litigants and lead to its unjust disposition. In addressing counsel, litigants, or witnesses, the judge should avoid a controversial tone.</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b318-8\">A judge should avoid interruptions of counsel in then-arguments except to clarify their positions, and should not be tempted to the unnecessary display of learning or a premature judgment.</blockquote>\n<p id=\"b318-9\">We conclude that Judge Moore\u2019s conduct frequently violated the Code of Judicial Conduct and demonstrates, on those occasions, a lack of judicial temperament. While the incidents vary in severity, and some may ostensibly seem innocuous, misconduct may be proven by \u201cevidence of an accumulation of small and ostensibly innocuous incidents which, when considered together, emerge as a pattern of hostile conduct unbecoming a member of the judiciary.\u201d <em>In re Mikesell, </em>396 Mich 517, 539; 243 NW2d 86 (1976), quoting <em>In re Kelly, </em>238 So 2d 565, 566 (Fla, 1970). Judge Moore\u2019s conduct demonstrates a pattern of persistent interference in and frequent interruption of the <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"133\">*133</page-number>trial of cases; impatient, discourteous, critical, and sometimes severe attitudes toward jurors, witnesses, counsel, and others present in the courtroom; and use of a controversial tone and maimer in addressing litigants, jurors, witnesses, and counsel. This conduct frequently resulted in appellate reversal of trials over which he had presided. Such behavior undermines public confidence in the integrity and impartiality of the judiciary and is clearly prejudicial to the administration of justice. Therefore, we conclude the conduct is of a nature that warrants discipline.</p>\n<p id=\"b319-5\">B</p>\n<p id=\"b319-6\">The commission recommended that Judge Moore be suspended for nine months without pay. In so recommending, the commission assessed previous discipline imposed on Judge Moore and applied the <em>Denting </em>factors cited by this Court in <em>In re Brown, </em>461 Mich 1291, 1292-1293 (2000). See part m. We principally agree with the commission\u2019s analysis of the case under the <em>Denting </em>factors and that Judge Moore\u2019s history of such behavior requires a significant sanction. However, we have disagreed with a few of the findings of misconduct on which the sanction was based. Further, we agree with the commission that Judge Moore has been a diligent jurist during his twenty years on the bench and that he often, means well, even where his judicial behavior has been inappropriate. Therefore, we modify the commission\u2019s recommendation and order that Judge Moore be suspended for six months without pay.</p>\n<p id=\"b319-7\">Pursuant to MCR 7.317(C)(3), the Clerk is directed to issue the judgment order forthwith.</p>\n<judges id=\"b320-3\"><page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"134\">*134</page-number>Corrigan, C.J., and Taylor, Young, and Markman, JJ., concurred with Weaver, J.</judges>\n<footnote label=\"1\">\n<p id=\"b285-7\"> The commission was established by Const 1963, art 6, \u00a7 30.</p>\n</footnote>\n<footnote label=\"2\">\n<p id=\"b285-8\"> Although the decision regarding misconduct was issued on July 18, 2000, it was not filed until October 10, 2000.</p>\n</footnote>\n<footnote label=\"3\">\n<p id=\"b285-9\"> <em>In re Seitz, </em>441 Mich 590, 594; 495 NW2d 559 (1993); <em>In re Bennett, </em>403 Mich 178, 184; 267 NW2d 914 (1978).</p>\n</footnote>\n<footnote label=\"4\">\n<p id=\"b286-11\"> Six of the trials occun-ed in the Detroit Recorder\u2019s Court, which later became part of the Third Circuit Court.

This Court\u2019s review of the commission\u2019s findings of fact and ultimate finding of misconduct involves only the events in those eight cases and not the past behavior of Judge Moore discussed in part ni of this opinion.
