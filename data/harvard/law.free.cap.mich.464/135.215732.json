In <em>In re </em>Brown, 461 Mich 1291 (2000), this Court set forth several factors that were among the criteria to be used in evaluating judicial discipline cases. We then remanded the present matter to the jtc for an application of the suggested factors to the facts of this case. The JTC, in a June 23, 2000 supplemental decision and recommendation, found that respondent was \u201cattempting to use the prestige of [his] office to gain a personal advantage\u201d and, thus, recommended a sanction of suspension from the discharge of all judicial and administrative duties without pay for a period of fifteen days. Upon review, we hereby adopt the jtc\u2019s recommended sanction of suspension from the discharge of all judicial and administrative duties without pay for a period of fifteen days.</p>\n<p id=\"b322-8\">i</p>\n<p id=\"b322-9\">These proceedings arise out of statements made by 50th District Court Judge Christopher C. Brown, respondent, following an automobile accident involving respondent and another driver. The jtc filed a <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"137\">*137</page-number>complaint and an evidentiary hearing was held. Following the hearing, the master concluded in a report that respondent did not abuse his office. The jtc\u2019s examiner then filed written objections to the report with the JTC. On review, the jtc made the following findings of fact:</p>\n<p id=\"b323-4\">(1) Respondent, at all times hereinafter mentioned, was a Judge of the 50th District Court in the City of Pontiac, County of Oakland, State of Michigan.</p>\n<p id=\"b323-5\">(2) Respondent was involved in an automobile accident with Sue Lambouris on April 26, 1996.</p>\n<p id=\"b323-6\">(3) The Pontiac Police Department was notified of the accident, and that officers Darryl Cosby and Craig Pesco responded to the location of the accident.</p>\n<p id=\"b323-7\">(4) Respondent knew police officer Darryl Cosby.</p>\n<p id=\"b323-8\">(5) Respondent told the police officers that Sue Lambouris was speeding. Specifically, Respondent stated that Mrs. Lambouris was \u201cdoing 85 miles per hour.\u201d</p>\n<p id=\"b323-9\">(6) Respondent requested that Mrs. Lambouris\u2019 name be \u201crun on L.E.I.N. [Law Enforcement Information Network] and ticketed.\u201d</p>\n<p id=\"b323-10\">On the basis of its findings of fact, which we adopt for purposes of this per curiam opinion, the JTC determined that respondent was \u201cattempting to use the prestige of [his] office to gain a personal advantage\u201d and that such conduct was \u201cclearly prejudicial\u201d to the administration of justice in violation of the Code of Judicial Conduct, Canons 1, 2A, 2B and 2C. The JTC then recommended that respondent be suspended from the discharge of all judicial and administrative duties without pay for fifteen days.</p>\n<p id=\"b323-11\">Upon review of the jtc\u2019s decision and recommendation, this Court remanded this matter to the jtc for <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"138\">*138</page-number>the \u201carticulation of standards of judicial discipline, and for the application of those standards to the instant case.\u201d <em>In re Brown, supra. </em>As we stated in that case, the development of standards by the jtc will better enable the jtc to respond to \u201cequivalent cases in an equivalent manner.\u201d Furthermore, the application of standards by the jtc will allow this Court to more meaningfully review the jtc\u2019s disciplinary recommendations. In <em>Brown, supra, </em>we articulated several factors that were <em>among </em>the criteria to be used in evaluating judicial discipline cases. The recommended factors are as follows:</p>\n<blockquote id=\"b324-6\">(1) misconduct that is part of a pattern or practice is more serious than an isolated instance of misconduct;</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b324-7\">(2) misconduct on the bench is usually more serious than the same misconduct off the bench;</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b324-8\">(3) misconduct that is prejudicial to the actual administration of justice is more serious than misconduct that is prejudicial only to the appearance propriety;</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b324-9\">(4) misconduct that does not implicate the actual administration of justice, or its appearance of impropriety, is less serious than misconduct that does;</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b324-10\">(5) misconduct that occurs spontaneously is less serious than misconduct that is premeditated or deliberated;</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b324-11\">(6) misconduct that undermines the ability of the justice system to discover the truth of what occurred in a legal controversy, or to reach the most just result in such a case, is more serious than misconduct that merely delays such discovery;</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b324-12\">(7) misconduct that involves the unequal application of justice on the basis of such considerations as race, color, ethnic background, gender, or religion are more serious than breaches of justice that do not disparage the integrity of the system on the basis of a class of citizenship. [461 Mich 1292-1293.]</blockquote>\n<p id=\"b325-3\"><page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"139\">*139</page-number>After remand, the jtc filed a supplemental recommendation. In this recommendation, the jtc determined that respondent was \u201cattempting to use the prestige of [his] office to gain a personal advantage.\u201d Consequently, the JTC again recommended that this Court suspend respondent from the discharge of all judicial and administrative duties for a period of fifteen days. The JTC, however, did not expressly apply the recommended factors as set forth in <em>In re Brown </em>for the reason that its membership had changed between the original recommendation and the remand. Therefore, before we \u201cadopt, reject, or modify\u201d the JTC\u2019s recommended discipline, we will engage in a brief analysis of the <em>Brown </em>factors as applied to Judge Brown himself.</p>\n<p id=\"b325-4\">n</p>\n<p id=\"b325-5\">Upon review, we conclude that factors 1, 2, 4, and 5 are relevant to this case. In particular, factors 1 and 4 support the JTC\u2019s recommended discipline of respondent. Pursuant to factor 1, we find that respondent\u2019s conduct was part of a pattern or practice of misconduct rather than an isolated instance of misconduct. As the jtc stated in its recommendation for discipline, respondent had been admonished by the JTC on four prior occasions for acts of misconduct.<footnotemark>1</footnotemark> Additionally, pursuant to factor 4, respondent\u2019s conduct implicated the appearance of impropriety. The record shows that respondent knew one of the investigating officers who arrived at the scene. This existing relationship, <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"140\">*140</page-number>coupled with respondent\u2019s attempted direction to the officer concerning the type of investigation that he should conduct with regard to the other driver, gave rise to an appearance of impropriety and had the potential to erode the public\u2019s confidence in the judiciary.<footnotemark>2</footnotemark></p>\n<p id=\"b326-5\">On the other hand, factors 2 and 5 mitigate against increasing respondent\u2019s sanction. Pursuant to factor 2, it is important to highlight that the misconduct at issue arose out of statements made pursuant to an automobile accident. The misconduct did not occur while respondent was on the bench. Additionally, pursuant to factor 5, the remarks made by respondent appear to have been made spontaneously and under at least some stress, with respondent having just been involved in an automobile accident. When the police officers arrived, respondent told the officers that Mrs. Lambouris was speeding at eighty-five miles an hour. With regard to this remark, the JTC found that \u201c[Respondent knowingly made a false statement.\u201d However, pursuant to the circumstances of this case, this Court concludes that this remark was merely a speculation concerning the rate of speed of the other driver. Concerning respondent\u2019s request that the <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"141\">*141</page-number>officers search Mrs. Lambouris\u2019 name in the LEIN system and ticket her, we reach the same conclusion. Respondent\u2019s remark was merely a spontaneous reaction in the immediate aftermath of an automobile accident. After weighing the above factors, and applying them to the circumstances of this case, we believe that respondent\u2019s past disciplinary indiscretions, as well as the appearance of impropriety that resulted from respondent\u2019s statements to the police officers, one of whom he knew, regarding the type of investigation that the officers should engage in was sufficient misconduct to warrant the adoption of the JTC\u2019s recommendation of discipline. Thus, we hold that respondent be suspended from the discharge of all judicial and administrative duties without pay for a period of fifteen days.</p>\n<p id=\"b327-4\">Pursuant to MCR 7.317(C)(3), the Clerk is directed to issue the judgment order forthwith.</p>\n<judges id=\"b327-5\">Cavanagh, Weaver, Kelly, Taylor, Young, and Markman, JJ., concurred.</judges>\n<footnote label=\"1\">\n<p id=\"b325-6\"> Even if the dissent is correct that respondent\u2019s behavior is not properly characterized as part of a \u201cpattern or practice\u201d of misconduct, there is nothing at all inappropriate in the jtc taking into consideration in its proportionality decisions altogether unrelated instances of misconduct.</p>\n</footnote>\n<footnote label=\"2\">\n<p id=\"b326-6\"> We do not disagree with the dissent\u2019s characterization of the rules of conduct with regard to \u201cjudge-victims.\u2019-\u2019 <em>Post </em>at 145. However, unlike the dissent, we believe that respondent\u2019s conduct went well beyond a mere \u201creportjing] the underlying facts involved in the crime.\u201d <em>Post </em>at 145. Rather, in this case, the respondent directed the officer to take two very specific actions: (a) run Ms. Lambouris\u2019 name through the lein system, and (b) issue Ms. Lambouris a ticket. Though a fine line cannot always be drawn in these matters, the respondent\u2019s direction to the officer, in our judgment, was not in the nature of a mere call to investigation, it was not simply a spontaneous expression of anger or pique, and it was more than a generalized call to the officer to do something about an unfortunate situation. Rather, when made to an officer who was aware of respondent\u2019s judicial status, such direction, in our opinion, invoked respondent\u2019s judicial status in an inappropriate manner.</p>\n</footnote>\n</opinion>\n<opinion data-order=\"8\" data-type=\"opinion\" id=\"x999-2\" type=\"dissent\">\n<author id=\"b327-6\">Corrigan, C.J.</author>\n<p id=\"AKY\">I respectfully dissent from the majority\u2019s decision to suspend respondent for fifteen days for certain statements he made in the aftermath of an automobile accident. I would hold that respondent\u2019s actions, while certainly not exemplary, did not constitute judicial misconduct because his conduct was not clearly prejudicial to the administration of justice.</p>\n<p id=\"b327-7\">i</p>\n<p id=\"b327-8\">These proceedings arise from a car accident involving respondent and another driver in Pontiac. Pontiac police officers responded to a call for assistance and investigated. Respondent told an officer with whom <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"142\">*142</page-number>he was acquainted that the other driver had been traveling at eighty-five miles an hour. He then requested that the officer run the other driver\u2019s name on the Law Enforcement Information Network (lein), and urged the officer to ticket the other driver. The officer did not, however, issue a ticket. The owner of the other car later brought an action in 50th District Court to recover his insurance deductible.</p>\n<p id=\"b328-4\">The Judicial Tenure Commission (JTC) complaint alleged misconduct arising from (1) respondent\u2019s conduct at the accident scene, (2) respondent\u2019s transfer of the district court action to another judge, and (3) respondent\u2019s conduct during the hearing on the district court lawsuit. The complaint also alleged misconduct arising from respondent\u2019s conduct during an unrelated criminal case and his unrelated actions in presiding over uncontested and default matters involving his court officer.</p>\n<p id=\"b328-5\">At the conclusion of an evidentiary hearing, the master determined that the examiner failed to establish judicial impropriety and that respondent did not violate the code of judicial conduct, court rules, or the constitution. The master found that respondent \u201cinformed the officers of [the other driver\u2019s] excessive speed (the testimony varies between 85 and 50 miles per hour) and . . . stated his desire to have [the other driver] run on a lien [sic] machine and ticketed . . . .\u201d The master further found that reason existed to believe that the other driver had been speeding, although the evidence did not support respondent\u2019s claim that the car had been traveling at eighty-five miles an hour. The master characterized respondent\u2019s statement that the other car was traveling \u201c85 miles per hour\u201d as a \u201chyperbolic exaggeration and not a deliberate falsification, similar perhaps to <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"143\">*143</page-number>claiming that \u2018she was going like a bat out of Hell.\u2019 \u201d The master rejected all the remaining allegations in the complaint.</p>\n<p id=\"b329-4\">The jtc affirmed the master\u2019s finding that respondent made the statements at the accident scene, but rejected the master\u2019s conclusion that respondent had not abused the prestige of his office. The jtc found that respondent\u2019s conduct violated Canons 1 and 2(A)-(C) of the Code of Judicial Conduct.<footnotemark>1</footnotemark> It found that respondent\u2019s conduct constituted misconduct under MCR 9.205(C)(4) because it was clearly prejudicial to the administration of justice. The JTC adopted the master\u2019s findings and conclusions regarding the other allegations of misconduct. It recommended that this Court suspend respondent for fifteen days.</p>\n<p id=\"AtB\"><page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"144\">*144</page-number>n</p>\n<p id=\"b330-5\">In this case, the jtc recommends discipline solely on the basis of respondent\u2019s conduct at the accident scene. Thus, while the complaint certainly alleged other misconduct, I have confined my review solely to judicial misconduct arising from respondent\u2019s statements to the investigating officers because this Court may discipline a judge only \u201c[o]n recommendation of the judicial tenure commission.\u201d Const 1963, art 6, \u00a7 30; see <em>In re Mikesell, </em>396 Mich 517, 524-527; 243 NW2d 86 (1976). I conclude that the jtc failed to prove by a preponderance of the evidence<footnotemark>2</footnotemark> that respondent attempted to use the prestige of his office to gain a personal advantage and that his conduct was <em>clearly </em>prejudicial to the administration of justice.</p>\n<p id=\"b330-6\">In my view, the determination whether respondent\u2019s conduct was clearly prejudicial to the administration of justice hinges on respondent\u2019s intent in making statements to the officers at the accident scene. The master found that respondent was \u201cshaken, excited and emotional\u201d after the accident. The master further characterized respondent\u2019s statement regarding the speed of the other driver\u2019s car as \u201chyperbole.\u201d I would defer to those findings because, although this Court reviews the record de novo, <em>In re Loyd, </em>424 Mich 514, 521; 384 NW2d 9 (1986), we accord deference to the master\u2019s ability to observe witnesses\u2019 demeanor and evaluate their credibility. <em>Id. </em>at 535. I thus defer to the master\u2019s credibility finding that respondent did not intentionally lie to the officer. I am frankly puzzled by the JTC majority\u2019s finding of <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"145\">*145</page-number>an intentional falsehood. They gave no reason for concluding that the master erred in his contrary credibility determination.<footnotemark>3</footnotemark></p>\n<p id=\"b331-4\">I further agree with the majority\u2019s characterization of respondent\u2019s statement at the accident scene as a \u201cspontaneous speculation\u201d induced by \u201cstress\u201d in the immediate aftermath of an automobile accident. I accept and see no clear error in the finding of the Master that Judge Brown\u2019s statement was hyperbole. Further, I accept the master\u2019s finding that Judge Brown had no insidious motive.</p>\n<p id=\"b331-5\">In light of this conclusion, I would not hold that Judge Brown knowingly and intentionally attempted to use the prestige of his office to gain a personal advantage. I cannot say with any degree of certainty that he attempted to misuse the prestige of his office to gain a personal advantage. His conduct seems to me equally likely the spontaneous reaction of a shaken accident victim.</p>\n<p id=\"b331-6\">The majority rule is that a judge-victim who is acquainted with the police officers who are conducting an investigation may provide a report about the relevant facts, but cannot recommend any action on the basis of those facts. Thus, a judge who is a victim of an armed robbery may report the underlying facts involved in the crime, but may not say, \u201cThere\u2019s <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"146\">*146</page-number>the robber \u2014 arrest that man.\u201d<footnotemark>4</footnotemark> The direction to arrest may demonstrate a misuse of office to advance personal interests in recovering the judge\u2019s stolen property.</p>\n<p id=\"b332-6\">Next, I cannot join the conclusion that Judge Brown\u2019s statements at the accident scene were part of a \u201cpattern and practice\u201d of misconduct on the basis of prior jtc admonitions against Judge Brown. Judge Brown\u2019s excited utterances at the accident scene were unique, isolated events, different in kind from the events and statements that formed the basis of the prior jtc admonitions. I cannot join the conclusion that Judge Brown\u2019s conduct at the accident scene demonstrates a pattern and practice of misconduct.</p>\n<p id=\"b332-7\">I would reject the jtc recommendation in this case because respondent\u2019s conduct at the accident scene was not clearly prejudicial to the administration of justice. The record does not reflect that the other driver heard respondent\u2019s remarks. Nor does it establish that respondent\u2019s statements influenced the officer\u2019s decision to issue a ticket. That a motorist whose vehicle has been struck in an accident would request in the immediate aftermath that the responding officer ticket the driver of the other car is not unusual. That a judge, still shaken from the accident, would make a similar request is not prejudicial to the administration of justice. Moreover, respondent\u2019s comment requesting a LEIN check does not, under the circumstances of this case, elevate respondent\u2019s conduct to a level that clearly prejudices the administration of justice. The master found that respondent <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"147\">*147</page-number>acted without an insidious motive. Accordingly, I would decline to impose discipline on the basis of respondent\u2019s conduct at the scene of the accident.<footnotemark>5</footnotemark></p>\n<p id=\"AWJ\"><page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"148\">*148</page-number>in</p>\n<p id=\"b334-5\">I conclude that respondent\u2019s actions were not clearly prejudicial to the administration of justice. I would therefore reject the jtc recommendation to discipline respondent. Accordingly, I dissent.</p>\n<footnote label=\"1\">\n<p id=\"b329-5\"> Canon 1 provides in part that \u201c[a] judge should participate in establishing, maintaining, and enforcing, and should personally observe, high standards of conduct so that the integrity and independence of the judiciary may be preserved.\u201d</p>\n<p id=\"b329-6\">Canon 2(A)-(C) provides:</p>\n<blockquote id=\"b329-7\">A. Public confidence in the judiciary is eroded by irresponsible or improper conduct by judges. A judge must avoid all impropriety and appearance of impropriety. A judge must expect to be the subject of constant public scrutiny. A judge must therefore accept restrictions on conduct that might be viewed as burdensome by the ordinary citizen and should do so freely and willingly.</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b329-8\">B. A judge should respect and observe the law. At all times, the conduct and manner of a judge should promote public confidence in the integrity and impartiality of the judiciary. Without regard to a person\u2019s race, gender, or other protected personal characteristic, a judge should treat every person fairly, with courtesy and respect.</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b329-9\">C. A judge should not allow family, social, or other relationships to influence judicial conduct or judgment. A judge should not use the prestige of office to advance personal business interests or those of others. A judge should not appear as a witness in a court proceeding unless subpoenaed.</blockquote>\n</footnote>\n<footnote label=\"2\">\n<p id=\"b330-7\"> <em>In re Loyd, </em>424 Mich 514, 521; 384 NW2d 9 (1986).</p>\n</footnote>\n<footnote label=\"3\">\n<p id=\"b331-7\"> Under MCR 9.221(B), the jtc must make written findings of fact and conclusions of law along with its recommendations for action, but may adopt the master\u2019s findings, in whole or in part, by reference. In light of the master\u2019s superior position for purposes of evaluating the credibility of witnesses, however, it is incumbent on the jtc to explain its reasons for rejecting a master\u2019s finding that turns on such a determination. Moreover, absent a hearing at which the witnesses actually testify before the jtc, MCR 9.219, I question whether this Court should reject the master\u2019s finding in favor of a contrary finding by the jtc.</p>\n</footnote>\n<footnote label=\"4\">\n<p id=\"b332-8\"> While an armed robbery is a <em>crime, </em>not an <em>accident, </em>both are startling events likely to trigger in the victim spontaneous, excited utterances.</p>\n</footnote>\n<footnote label=\"5\">\n<p id=\"AQM\"> Assuming that respondent\u2019s actions constituted misconduct, the misconduct would not warrant a suspension. I also part company from my colleagues in their application of the governing principles set out in our prior order to these facts:</p>\n<blockquote id=\"ar-dedup-0\">While we do not purport to substitute our judgment for that of the jtc in this regard, some of these standards are obvious. For example, everything else being equal:</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"AjQ\">(1) misconduct that is part of a pattern or practice is more serious than an isolated instance of misconduct;</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"A1X\">(2) misconduct on the bench is usually more serious than the same misconduct off the bench;</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"AKB\">(3) misconduct that is prejudicial to the actual administration of justice is more serious than misconduct that is prejudicial only to the appearance of propriety;</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"Az-\">(4) misconduct that does not implicate the actual administration of justice, or its appearance of impropriety, is less serious than misconduct that does;</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"An\">(5) misconduct that occurs spontaneously is less serious than misconduct that is premeditated or deliberated;</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"ABc\">(6) misconduct that undermines the ability of the justice system to discover the truth of what occurred in a legal controversy, or to reach the most just result in such a case, is more serious than misconduct that merely delays such discovery;</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"AuM\">(7) misconduct that involves the unequal application of justice on the basis of such considerations as race, color, ethnic background, gender, or religion are more serious than breaches of justice that do not disparage the integrity of the system on the basis of a class of citizenship. [461 Mich 1292-1293.]</blockquote>\n<p id=\"AoZ\">Application of these factors to this case suggests the lightest form of discipline for those members of this Court who conclude that respondent was engaged in judicial misconduct \u2014 a censure. Respondent\u2019s acts were spontaneous, isolated, occurred off the bench, and, at most, gave the appearance of impropriety. Respondent\u2019s conduct did not implicate the actual administration of justice, and did not affect the ability of the justice system to discover the truth in a case. Moreover, the alleged misconduct does not involve the unequal application of justice. Under the circumstances of this case, a suspension is not appropriate.</p>\n</footnote>\n</opinion>\n</casebody>\n",
