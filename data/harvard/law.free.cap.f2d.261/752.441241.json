The Commissioner moved to dismiss the complaint on the ground that the court lacked jurisdiction over the parties and the subject matter. The court dismissed the complaint pursuant to the motion and at the same time denied a motion of appellants for leave to amend their complaint. This appeal followed.</p>\n<p id=\"b808-19\">We find no abuse of discretion in the denial of the motion for leave to amend the complaint and we think the motion to dismiss was properly granted since appellants\u2019 complaint was not timely filed. See 35 U.S.C. \u00a7 145 (1952) and Rule 304 of the Rules of Practice in Patent Cases, 35 U.S.C. Appendix, 22 Fed.Reg. <em>5770 </em>(1957), amending 37 C.F.R. \u00a7 1.304 (1952).</p>\n<p id=\"b808-20\">Affirmed.</p>\n</opinion>\n</casebody>\n",
