Commissioner of Internal Revenue, 5 Cir., 257 F.2d 595. Having decided that on such similar facts the sale of the breeding herd in Carter was the sale of Section 117(j), 26 U.S.C.A. \u00a7 117 (j) property we also hold here that the sale of the breeding herd at a loss did not produce a loss \u201cattributable to the operation of a trade or business regularly carried on by the taxpayer\u201d within the terms of the loss carry-back provisions of the Internal Revenue Code of 1939.</p>\n<p id=\"b323-18\">The decision of the Tax Court is affirmed on the opinion of the Tax Court, 29 T.C. 7, and on the authority of Carter v. Commissioner of Internal Revenue, supra.</p>\n</opinion>\n</casebody>\n",
