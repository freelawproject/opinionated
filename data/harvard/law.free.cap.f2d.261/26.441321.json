The defendant interposed a counterclaim.</p>\n<p id=\"b83-4\">In Count I of his amended petition, plaintiff alleged that on October 13, 1954, as the result of defendant\u2019s duress, threats and coercion, he was compelled to sign an agreement with respect to his employment. Plaintiff prayed for re-cision and cancellation of the contract, and for $25,000 actual damages. On this count the jury awarded plaintiff $100 as damages. Count III was based on plaintiff\u2019s contribution to a profit-sharing plan. Jury verdict for plaintiff was for $97.65. In Count V, plaintiff prayed for the amount of his last week\u2019s draw and obtained verdict for $175. In Count VIII plaintiff sought commissions due him from his St. Louis accounts and recovered verdict for $4800. Count IX sought punitive damages and the jury awarded plaintiff $20,000. Other counts of plaintiff\u2019s petition are not involved in this appeal. On defendant\u2019s counterclaim for $25,246.20, representing overdrafts by plaintiff over and above his actual commission earnings, the jury found for plaintiff and against the defendant.</p>\n<p id=\"b83-5\">The trial court sustained defendant\u2019s after-trial motion for judgment as to Counts I and IX of plaintiff\u2019s petition and entered judgment for defendant thereon. The court also sustained defendant\u2019s motion for new trial as to all five counts of the petition on which plaintiff had recovered jury verdicts.<footnotemark>1</footnotemark> The reason assigned by the court for this action was that the verdict was against the weight of the evidence. Defendant\u2019s motion for new trial as to the counterclaim was sustained on the same ground and for the additional reason that the instructions dealing with this phase of the case were erroneous in that they did not properly submit the issue of duress to the jury.</p>\n<p id=\"b83-10\">Plaintiff appealed from the order</p>\n<blockquote id=\"Ah1\">\u201cgranting judgment for defendant notwithstanding the verdict on Counts I and IX of the amended petition, and further appeals from the District Court\u2019s order granting a new trial on Counts III, V and VIII of the above-mentioned amended petition * * <footnotemark>2</footnotemark></blockquote>\n<p id=\"b83-11\">At the outset, we raise, <em>sua sponte, </em>the question of our jurisdiction to entertain this appeal. For impelling legal reasons, which we shall presently point out, we are driven to the conclusion that the case is not properly before us, and jurisdiction remains in the trial court.</p>\n<p id=\"b83-12\">The after-trial action by the court did not finally dispose of all of the issues so as to constitute a final decision within the meaning of Title 28 U.S.C.A. \u00a7 1291, which provides that courts of appeal shall have jurisdiction of appeals from all <em>final </em>decisions of the district courts. As we have seen, defendant\u2019s motion for judgment notwithstanding the verdict was sustained as to Counts I and IX, and judgment rendered accordingly. But as to the three remaining counts upon which plaintiff had prevailed, and defendant's counterclaim, the Court directed a new trial.</p>\n<p id=\"b83-13\"> It is a firmly entrenched principle of federal jurisprudence that a motion for new trial is directed to the sound discretion of the trial court, Stofer v. Montgomery Ward &amp; Co., 8 Cir., 249 F.2d 285, 288; Agnew v. Cox, 8 Cir., 254 F.2d 263, 267-268; Hobart v. O\u2019Brien, 1 Cir., 243 F.2d 735, 744, certiorari denied 355 U.S. 830, 78 S.Ct. 42, 2 L.Ed.2d 42, rehearing denied 355 U.S. 879, 78 S.Ct. 139, 2 L.Ed.2d 110; Phoenix Indemnity Co. v. Girouard, 5 Cir., 252 F.2d 146, 148, and the granting or denial of a new trial is not an appealable order. In Buder v. Fiske, 8 Cir., <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"28\">*28</page-number>174 F.2d 260, at page 265, modified 177 F.2d 907, this Court, in so holding, stated: \u201cSuch determination may be challenged \u2014 on the ground of abuse of discretion \u2014 in an appeal from the <em>final judgment. </em>Marshall\u2019s U. S. Auto Supply, Inc. v. Cashman, 10 Cir., 111 F.2d 140, 141.\u201d (Emphasis supplied.) In Koppal v. Transcontinental &amp; Western Air., 8 Cir., 199 F.2d 117, reversed on other grounds 345 U.S. 653, 73 S.Ct. 906, 97 L.Ed. 1325, the trial court\u2019s after-trial action was similar to the course pursued herein. Judgment n. o. v. was entered for defendant, and in the alternative a new trial was granted. On appeal, we were asked in effect to pass upon the order granting the new trial. In declining to rule, Judge Johnsen, speaking for the Court, stated, 199 F.2d at page 124: \u201cWe are asked by plaintiff to make expression upon the correctness of these views of the trial court. The granting of a new trial is of course not as such a reviewable order.\u201d See also Moore\u2019s Federal Practice, Second Edition, Vol. 5, \u00a7 50.14, and cf. Cudahy Packing Co. v. City of Omaha, 8 Cir., 24 F.2d 3, 7, certiorari denied 278 U.S. 601, 49 S.Ct. 9, 73 L.Ed. 530; Kansas City Stockyards Co. of Maine v. Anderson, 8 Cir., 199 F.2d 91, 95, 36 A.L.R.2d 1; Citizens National Bank of Lubbock v. Speer, 5 Cir., 220 F.2d 889; Kanatser v. Chrysler Corp., 10 Cir., 199 F.2d 610, 615, certiorari denied 344 U.S. 921, 73 S.Ct. 388, 97 L.Ed. 710.</p>\n<p id=\"b84-5\">Provision has been made whereby an appeal could have been properly prosecuted froip the judgment on Counts I and IX. Rule 54(b), Federal Rules of Civil Procedure, 28 U.S.C.A., provides:</p>\n<blockquote id=\"b84-6\">\u201cWhen more than one claim for relief is presented in an action * * * the court may direct the entry of a final judgment upon one or more but less than all of the claims <em>only upon an express determination that there is no just reason for delay and upon an express direction for the entry of judgment. </em>In the absence of such determination and direction, any order or other form of decision, however designated, which adjudicates less than all the claims shall not terminate the action as to any of the claims, and the order or other form of decision is subject to revision at any time before the entry of judgment adjudicating all the claims.\u201d (Emphasis supplied.)</blockquote>\n<p id=\"b84-9\">However, the course authorized by the foregoing rule was not pursued, as the trial court did not make an \u201cexpress determination that there is no just-reason for delay\u201d nor \u201can express direction for the entry of judgment.\u201d In this-situation, and inasmuch as the order-sustaining the motion for new trial is-not as such appealable, it necessarily follows that the entire case rests in the-trial court. Being without jurisdiction,, the appeal must be dismissed.
