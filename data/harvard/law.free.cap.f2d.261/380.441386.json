The action was for an injunction and treble damages, based upon an alleged violation of the antitrust laws.</p>\n<p id=\"b436-22\">Briefly stated, plaintiff asserted that defendants (appellees) had entered into a mutually devised plan or conspiracy to hold back the film availability of plaintiff\u2019s motion picture theatre to an absolute minimum of twenty-one days; that no clearance over the theatre was justified since it was claimed there was no substantial competition between first-run houses and plaintiff\u2019s theatre; and that, even if there were substantial competition between the first-run theatres and plaintiff\u2019s theatre, the long delayed availability was wholly unjustified.</p>\n<p id=\"b437-3\"><page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"381\">*381</page-number>The ease was tried before the District Court without a jury. That court directed that the issue of liability be heard first, and announced that, if the plaintiff prevailed, the trial would be resumed for the purpose of ascertaining the amount of damages, if any. After the conclusion of the hearing on the issue of liability, the District Court took the case under advisement, and thereafter filed its opinion<footnotemark>1</footnotemark> and entered judgment dismissing the complaint on the merits and with prejudice.</p>\n<p id=\"b437-4\">On examination of the record, we find no reason to disturb the trial court\u2019s ruling on the question of evidence complained of by plaintiff or the result reached by the trial judge.</p>\n<p id=\"b437-5\">Afiirmed.</p>\n<footnote label=\"1\">\n<p id=\"b437-14\">. 1957, 156 F.Supp. 770.
