Internal Revenue Code of 1939, \u00a7 3672(b)(1), 26 U.S.C. \u00a7 3672.</p>\n<p id=\"b649-18\">The burden of proof was on the Government to establish such notice or knowledge on the part of the pledgee by a preponderance of the evidence.</p>\n<p id=\"b649-19\">The District Judge found that the evidence was insufficient to establish such knowledge and that the pledgee had priority. A review of the record convinces us that this finding of fact was correct and the judgment of the District Court is, therefore, affirmed.</p>\n</opinion>\n</casebody>\n",
