He has never been represented by counsel as he shall choose at any hearing, and has had no intelligent, reasonable opportunity to explain the detailed circumstances relative to the offense committed in the country of Holland which gives rise to the deportation proceeding.</p>\n<p id=\"b885-16\">It is impossible to determine intelligently under the record as it now exists whether the order of deportation is based upon reasonable, substantial and probative evidence as required by law. 8 U.S.C.A. \u00a7 1252(b)(4).</p>\n<p id=\"b885-17\">It appears that Immigration and Naturalization Service has not offered appellant the rights and privileges provided by law. The judgment of the District Court is reversed, and the cause is remanded with direction that the proceedings be stayed so that appellant will have the right and opportunity, after due notice, to be represented by counsel of his choice and to offer evidence in his own behalf before an appropriate representative of Immigration and Naturalization Service.</p>\n</opinion>\n</casebody>\n",
