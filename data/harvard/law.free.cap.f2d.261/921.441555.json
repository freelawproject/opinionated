The district court granted the defendant\u2019s motion holding that the oral contract fell within the lifetime provision of \u00a7 31(1) of the New York Personal Property Law, McKinney\u2019s Consol.Laws, c. 41 which provides ;</p>\n<blockquote id=\"b978-20\">\u201cEvery agreement, promise or undertaking is void, unless it or some note or memorandum thereof be in <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"923\">*923</page-number>writing, and subscribed by the party to be charged therewith, or by his lawful agent, if such agreement, promise or undertaking:</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b979-5\">\u201c1. By its terms is not to be performed within one year from the making thereof or the performance of which is not to be completed before the end of a lifetime; * * *\u2022\u201d</blockquote>\n<p id=\"b979-6\">The plaintiff contends in this appeal that the decision of the district court was erroneous and contrary to the interpretation of \u00a7 31(1) adopted by the court in Eckhart v. Plastic Film Corporation, D.C.Conn.1955,129 F.Supp. 277 which interpretation was followed in Cary v. U. S. Hoffman Machinery Corporation, D.C. 1957, 148 F.Supp. 748, 752. However, we are of the opinion that insofar as the Eekhart case conflicts with the decision of the court below it is in error. In the Eekhart case the district court suggested that \u00a7 31(1) was not intended to invalidate lifetime employment contracts and cited as authority for this proposition Brown v. Babcock, 4th Dep\u2019t 1943, 265 App.Div. 596, 40 N.Y.S.2d 428; Trickey v. J. M. Pitkin &amp; Co., 4th Dep\u2019t 1936, 249 App.Div. 707, 291 N.Y.S. 430 and Weiner v. Pictorial Paper Package Corp., 1939, 303 Mass. 123, 20 N.E.2d 458. Both the Brown and Weiner cases involve contracts for permanent employment, and under the decision in Arentz v. Morse Dry Dock &amp; Repair Co., 1928, 249 N.Y. 439, 164 N.E. 342, 62 A.L.R. 231 the words \u201cpermanent employment\u201d standing alone and by themselves do not mean lifetime employment but rather indicate only an agreement that the employment is to continue indefinitely and until one or the other of the parties wishes for some good reason to sever the relation. There is no question that in the instant case the contract was for lifetime employment. In the Trickey ease the contract was entered into in 1929 and therefore prior to the 1933 amendment to the Personal Property Law of New York which added the provision relating to lifetime performance contracts and consequently it did not come under the provisions of this amendment. See Ralph v. Cronk, Sup.Ct.1934, 150 Misc. 69, 268 N.Y.S. 429, affirmed 266 N.Y. 428, 195 N.E. 139; Fredenburg v. Fredenburg, Sup.Ct.1936, 159 Misc. 525, 288 N. Y.S. 377. Moreover, the contract in the Trickey case was also for permanent rather than lifetime employment. Thus these cases cannot be considered on any ground as authority for the proposition that lifetime employment contracts are without the provisions of \u00a7 31(1).</p>\n<p id=\"b979-8\">As further ground for its decision, the court in the Eckhart case pointed to dictum in In re Quigley\u2019s Estate, Sur.Ct.1942, 179 Misc. 210, 38 N.Y.S.2d 330; Bayreuther v. Reinisch, 1st Dep\u2019t 1942, 264 App.Div. 138, 34 N.Y.S.2d 674, affirmed 290 N.Y. 553, 47 N.E.2d 959; In re Ditson\u2019s Estate, Sur.Ct.1941, 177 Misc. 648, 31 N.Y.S.2d 468, that the purpose of the 1933 amendment was to prevent assertions of oral claims against the funds of deceased persons who after their death are unable to make a denial. That this amendment should be so limited seems quite doubtful, however, in view of the words of the Court of Appeals of New York in Meltzer v. Koenigsberg, 1951, 302 N.Y. 523, 99 N.E.2d 679 that \u201cThe language found in the statute is clear and unambiguous, and, as this court long ago declared, and frequently repeated, in the construction of statutes, the intent of the framers \u2018is to be sought first of all, in the words and language employed, and if the words are free from ambiguity and doubt, and express plainly, clearly and distinctly, the sense of the framers of the instrument, there is no occasion to resort to other means of interpretation. It is not allowable to interpret what has no need of interpretation, and when the words have a definite and precise meaning, to go elsewhere in search of conjecture in order to restrict or extend the meaning. * * * \u2019 \u201d In the Meltzer case an oral agreement by prom-isors to share equally the proceeds of the deceased\u2019s estate with the plaintiff in consideration of the plaintiff\u2019s having paid certain of the deceased\u2019s expenses during his lifetime was held to be unenforceable. It is to be noted that the statute of frauds <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"924\">*924</page-number>was applied even though the promisors were alive at the date of the litigation. It would, therefore, follow that the statute cannot be interpreted as solely for the prevention of claims against the funds of deceased persons who after their death are unable to make a denial.</p>\n<p id=\"b980-4\">As additional support for the decision of the district court in the instant case, appellee cites four cases decided by the New York courts where \u00a7 31(1) has been applied so as to render lifetime contracts unenforceable. Tinto v. Howard, Sup.Ct. 1944, 52 N.Y.S.2d 245, affirmed App.Div., 2d Dep\u2019t, 269 App.Div. 990, 59 N.Y.S.2d 152; Owens v. Owens, App.Div., 2d Dep\u2019t, 1954, 205 Misc. 506, 132 N.Y.S.2d 215; Weiss v. Weiss, App.Div., 2d Dep\u2019t 1945, 268 App.Div. 1058, 52 N.Y.S.2d 557; Roth v. Patino, Sup.Ct.1945, 185 Misc. 235, 56 N.Y.S.2d 853. In our opinion, these cases clearly support the decision of the district court.</p>\n<p id=\"b980-7\">Plaintiff\u2019s brief seems to suggest that as the one year provision is held inapplicable to lifetime contracts because of the possibility of complete performance within the year through the death of one of the parties, so this contract which by its terms is for a lifetime is not rendered unenforceable because of \u00a7 31(1) as there is a possibility that performance will be completed before the end of a lifetime through the plaintiff\u2019s inability to continue rendering her services as a companion or because her performance may not meet the reasonable approval of the defendant. However, plaintiff has not alleged that there was any express agreement as to a right of termination of the contract because of these contingencies. Cf. Blake v. Voight, 1892,134 N.Y. 69, 31 N.E. 256. Moreover, neither the inability of the plaintiff to continue to render her services nor the refusal of the defendant to accept those services result in performance of the contract. Both are breaches of the contract but liability for such a breach may not be incurred because of circumstances excusing the completion of the promised performance. See 2 Williston on Contracts, \u00a7 496 (1936 ed.) By the terms of the contract the defendant\u2019s liability is to endure to the instant of death of the plaintiff (see Owens v. Owens, supra, 205 Misc. at page 507, 132 N.Y.S.2d 215), and the. endurance of the defendant\u2019s liability is the deciding factor. See Martocci v. Greater New York Brewery, 1950, 301 N.Y. 57, 92 N.E.2d 887. Consequently as the defendant cannot complete performance of the contract before the end of the plaintiff\u2019s lifetime, the contract clearly falls within the provisions of \u00a7 31(1) of the New York Personal Property Law.</p>\n<p id=\"b980-9\">A judgment will be entered affirming the judgment of the district court.</p>\n</opinion>\n</casebody>\n",
