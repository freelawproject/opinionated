That order granted amended certificates of public convenience and necessity which were to become effective on November 29, 1958, but were stayed by the Board through December 6, 1958, so that this court might in the meantime hear and dispose of the petitions for stay presented to it. The granting of the requested stay is opposed by the Board and by the intervening airlines, Northwest, Delta, and Capital.</p>\n<p id=\"b886-24\">Section 1006(d) of the Civil Aeronautics Act, 49 U.S.C.A. \u00a7 646(d), authorizes the court to grant a stay \u201cupon good cause shown.\u201d The petitioners also rely upon Section 10(d) of the Administrative Procedure Act, 5 U.S.C.A. \u00a7 1009(d).</p>\n<p id=\"b886-25\">The Court of Appeals for the District of Columbia has recently held in Virginia Petroleum Jobbers Association v.
