It is upon this clause that plaintiff relies in bringing its suit.</p>\n<p id=\"b925-15\">The City answered that the agreement of February 4, 1941, and particularly the option to purchase the property at-any time during the life of the instrument, which the plaintiff sought to enforce, is invalid and unenforceable. By counter claim, it sought possession of the property.</p>\n<p id=\"b925-16\">The cause was submitted to the court on a stipulation, and the district judge, in a thoughtful and well considered opinion,<footnotemark>1</footnotemark> fully setting out the facts and giving his reasons for so determining, determined and held: (1) that the contract of February 4, 1941, insofar as it purports to grant the right or option to renew the purported lease for an additional twenty years from its original expiration is null and void; (2) that it is also null and void insofar as it purports to grant an option to purchase; and (3) that the City is entitled to the possession of the property.</p>\n<p id=\"b925-17\">Because we find ourselves in full agreement with these conclusions and with the <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"870\">*870</page-number>reasons given by the district judge in support thereof, we will not undertake to restate here what has been so well stated by him in his opinion, but, simply noting our concurrence therein, we order the judgment Affirmed.</p>\n<footnote label=\"1\">\n<p id=\"b925-18\">.
