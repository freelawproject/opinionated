This grant permits Seaboard to carry United States mail across the Atlantic while the Board considers and determines Seaboard\u2019s application for certificate of authority to carry such mail. Pan American World Airways, Inc.<footnotemark>2</footnotemark> and Trans World Airlines, Inc.,<footnotemark>3</footnotemark> the only United States airlines presently certified for transatlantic mail carriage, separately petition this court for review of the exemption grant. Civil Aeronautics Act, \u00a7 1006, 52 Stat. 1024 (1938), 49 U.S.C.A. \u00a7 646. The cases were consolidated and came on for hearing.</p>\n<p id=\"b812-4\">Both petitioners contend that this exemption grant contravenes the certification requirements of \u00a7 401 of the Act, 52 Stat. 987 (1938), 49 U.S.C.A. \u00a7 481, because it is not supported by requisite findings. TWA additionally contends that the exemption was invalid because it lacked the President\u2019s signature. Civil Aeronautics Act, \u00a7 801, 52 Stat. 1014 (1938), 49 U.S.C.A. \u00a7 601.</p>\n<p id=\"b812-5\">I. \u2014 Presidential Approval.</p>\n<p id=\"b812-6\">We are obliged first to consider TWA\u2019s contention that the exemption authorization, which is an exemption <em>from </em>the requirement for a certificate, is invalid because it did not have presidential approval under \u00a7 801 of the Act. The Board and intervenor urge such approval is not required. No court has passed directly on this question.</p>\n<p id=\"b812-7\">Section 801 of the Act deals in terms of \u201cissuance, denial, transfer, amendment, cancellation, suspension, or revocation of, and the terms, conditions, and limitations contained in, any certificate authorizing an air carrier to engage in overseas or foreign air transportation * * and these require presidential approval. The Waterman case<footnotemark>4</footnotemark> makes clear that Board action affected by this provision (\u00a7 801) is not subject to judicial review. Hence, if \u00a7 801 applies, these petitions must be dismissed for lack of jurisdiction.</p>\n<p id=\"b812-14\">We are not persuaded, however, that an <em>exemption </em>which for a limited period authorizes a carrier to transport overseas mail between points already receiving certified cargo service from the same carrier is subject to the restrictions of \u00a7 801. Section 801 contains no reference to exemptions although it recites explicitly a whole series of Board actions relative to certificates affected by the statute. True, the exemption has operative effects not unlike an amendment of a certificate, but the extraordinary power vested in the Executive by this statute should not be expanded beyond the needs of the foreign relations considerations which have been relied on to justify the grant. Chicago &amp; Southern Air Lines, Inc. v. Waterman S.S. Corp., note 4 supra, 333 U.S. at page 111, 68 S.Ct. at page 436.</p>\n<p id=\"b812-15\">These factors \u2014 the uniqueness of the statutory provision, its drastic impact, the precise definition of the statute, and the Board\u2019s interpretations fortify the conclusion that Congress did not intend to include exemptions in \u00a7 801. The enduring and continuing character of the operations under a certificate as contrasted with the temporary and limited character of the exemption supply the most important basis for distinction.</p>\n<p id=\"b812-16\">II. \u2014 Validity of the Exemption.</p>\n<p id=\"b812-17\">Section 416(b) of the Act<footnotemark>5</footnotemark> permits the Board to exempt an air carrier from the certificate requirements of \u00a7 <em>401 </em>if, <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"757\">*757</page-number>but only if it first finds that enforcement of those requirements would have certain specified results because of the existence of certain specified conditions. The Board must find that the \u201coperations\u201d of the air carrier seeking the exemption are either (1) of \u201climited extent\u201d or (2) affected by \u201cunusual circumstances.\u201d Aside from finding that one of these conditions is present, the Board must also find that that condition <em>causes </em>enforcement of the certificate requirements to work \u201can undue burden\u201d on the carrier. Finally, the Board must find that enforcement of the requirements \u201cis not in the public interest.\u201d In the absence of any one of these findings the Board is not authorized to suspend the normal statutory requirements of notice, hearing and requisite findings for issuance of a certificate of public convenience and necessity.</p>\n<p id=\"b813-4\">Nor may these findings be merely a recital of \u00a7 416(b). The Board \u201cmust find what the statute requires it to find, not in conclusory fashion in the statutory language but in such fashion that a reviewing court can test the validity of the finding.\u201d American Airlines, Inc. v. Civil Aeronautics Board, 1956, 98 U.S.App.D.C. 348, 356, 235 F.2d 845, 853.</p>\n<p id=\"b813-5\">The Board\u2019s findings in this case are short and somewhat cursory, consisting of but three paragraphs. It found that \u201cSeaboard\u2019s financial situation is acute,\u201d and that \u201cSeaboard\u2019s existence is in jeopardy.\u201d With no further preliminaries it found that</p>\n<blockquote id=\"b813-6\">\u201cTo deprive the carrier of the opportunity to earn these revenues [from mail carriage] pending decision on its certificate application would impose an undue burden on it and would not be in the public interest.\u201d</blockquote>\n<p id=\"b813-11\">It found that the diversion of mail revenues from Pan American and TWA would be slight but that \u201cthe benefit to Seaboard will be relatively substantial.\u201d From these premises the Board concluded \u201cthat the authority conferred by exemption is limited in extent and in the public interest.\u201d<footnotemark>6</footnotemark> Finally the Board\u2019s order recited the language of \u00a7 416(b) in concluding that the exemption should be granted.</p>\n<p id=\"b813-12\">Without considering the problem of whether these findings are supported by the record, we hold them inadequate to meet the statutory requirements. The \u201cundue burden\u201d the Board has found is deprivation of revenues during the course of certification proceedings. This \u201cburden\u201d is found to be \u201cundue\u201d because of the financial straits in which Seaboard finds itself. Obviously, any carrier not granted an exemption will be \u201cdeprived\u201d of an opportunity to earn revenues from a particular carriage until it is awarded a certificate therefor. The Board has found only one circumstance here that is not present in every certification proceeding: Seaboard\u2019s financial distress. This is insufficient. If Congress had wanted to exclude economically marginal carriers from certification requirements, it would have done so in more explicit terms than those of \u00a7 416(b).<footnotemark>7</footnotemark> Of course, an unusual circumstance which causes final distress may be such a circumstance as to warrant relief under this exemption provi<page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"758\">*758</page-number>sion. But financial distress in and of itself, unrelated to circumstances which would render the carrier eligible, is not enough.</p>\n<p id=\"b814-4\">In the Surface Mail Experiment Case <footnotemark>8</footnotemark> we upheld an exemption grant, but even there the decision was close under circumstances far more compelling than those here. That exemption permitted certain all-cargo air carriers to participate in a Post Office experiment to determine whether it would be economical and feasible to send some surface mail by air. It was found that certification proceedings, even on an interim basis, could not be completed in time to enable the exempted carriers to participate in the experiment. The court plainly relied heavily on this finding, and Judge Pretty-man in concurring said: \u201cIn such event denial of an exemption would be a total and final deprivation of participation. That is not the case in the usual application for exemption.\u201d<footnotemark>9</footnotemark></p>\n<p id=\"b814-5\">Additionally, in the Surface Mail Experiment Case the Post Office recommended an exemption, reasoning that (a) additional mail volume was anticipated; (b) the cargo carriers would provide protection against service interruptions; and (c) by participation in the experiment the carriers would gain valuable experience. In the present case the Post Office has taken a position that at best might be called neutral. It has said that \u201cthere is more capacity than currently needed for the transportation of airmail from the New York Gateway to European points and consequently there is not the peculiar need for exemption which existed because of the airlift experiment * * These comments by the Post Office Department tend to weaken the Board\u2019s conclusory finding in this case that enforcement of the certificate requirements would not be in the public interest. It is not necessary to hold, however, that this finding has \u201cno rational basis.\u201d We hold only that financial distress is not a circumstance which, standing alone, meets the requirements of \u00a7 416(b). Accordingly, we set aside the order granting an exemption to Seaboard.</p>\n<p id=\"b814-10\">Order set aside.</p>\n<footnote label=\"1\">\n<p id=\"b811-22\">.

The Board seems to have misunderstood the \u201climited extent\u201d requirement.
