The district court, on motion under 28 U.S.C. \u00a7 1404(a), entered an order on February 5, 1958 (Civ.Action No. 57-168-S) transferring the case to the United States District Court for the Northern District of Florida. Though the obvious purpose of appellant is now to have us review the merits of this old order of transfer, we have no means of knowing, on the present record, whether or not the district court \u201cabused its discretion\u201d in entering such order.</p>\n<p id=\"b209-24\">In any event, such order of transfer could not have been reviewed by us upon appeal. Jiffy Lubricator Co., Inc., v. Stewart-Warner Corp., 4 Cir., 1949, 177 F.2d 360 certiorari denied 1950, 338 U.S. 947, 70 S.Ct. 484, 94 L.Ed. 584. Nor would we have reviewed it upon a <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"154\">*154</page-number>writ of mandamus issued by us under the \u201call writs\u201d section of the Judicial Code, 28 U.S.C: \u00a7 1651(a). See In re Josephson, 1 Cir., 1954, 218 F.2d 174.</p>\n<p id=\"b210-4\">Subsequently, the plaintiffs filed a new complaint in the court below, predicated on the identical cause of action set forth in the first complaint. Defendant filed a motion to dismiss this second complaint, on the ground that the transferred case was still pending in the United States District Court for the Northern District of Florida. Pursuant thereto, the district court entered its judgment dismissing the second complaint.</p>\n<p id=\"b210-5\">It is clear that this court has no jurisdiction to review this case on appeal, in view of 28 U.S.C. \u00a7 2105 which reads: \u201cThere shall be no reversal in the Supreme Court or a court of appeals for error in ruling upon matters in abatement which do not involve jurisdiction.\u201d See Stephens v. Monongahela Bank, 1884, 111 U.S. 197, 4 S.Ct. 336, 28 L.Ed. 399; Green v. Underwood, 8 Cir., 1898, 86 F. 427; McHie v. McHie, 7 Cir., 1935, 78 F.2d 351; Bowles v. Wilke, 7 Cir., 1949, 175 F.2d 35.</p>\n<p id=\"b210-6\">A judgment will be entered dismissing the appeal for lack of jurisdiction.</p>\n</opinion>\n</casebody>\n",
