Rev.Stat.1957, c. 83, par. 13 \u00a7 12; S.H.

Suit commenced in U. S. District Court, below, by plaintiff against defendant.</p>\n<p id=\"b469-13\">District Judge dismissed action.</p>\n<p id=\"b469-14\">When sustaining defendant\u2019s motion to dismiss No. 57C2084, the Judge below, after noting the absence of Illinois decisions on point, crystallized the key question in this fashion: \u201c * * * [Wjhether * * * [the] statute, extending the period of the original statute of limitations, authorizes a plaintiff to bring another action within a year after his first action under the * * * statute fails for a reason within the statutory provision.\u201d Resolving that issue against plaintiff\u2019s contentions was sound judgment. For plaintiff is urging, in substance, that \u00a7 24a authorizes filing of an action \u201cwithin one year after an involuntary nonsuit\u201d and plaintiff filed a suit, in the District Court, within one year after No. 57539 was dismissed in the Will County Circuit Court. Illinois aimed the two years statute of limitations at the primary cause of action when it accrued and the statutory relief by way of the one year period of grace is geared to that one.</p>\n<p id=\"b469-17\">Section 24a mentions only \u201ca new action\u201d not multiple new. actions and significantly reads in terms of relief following in the wake of an initial action. Clearly \u00a7 15 S.H.A. ch. 83 and \u00a7 24a must be read against the backdrop of \u00a7 13 S.H.A. ch. 83 which runs, in part pertinent, \u201cThe following actions <em>can only </em>be <em>commenced </em>within the periods hereinafter prescribed * * *\u201d (Italics added). The balance of \u00a7 13 covers \u00a7 24a situations, but we find nothing in this statutory language authorizing repeated commencement of lawsuits such as at bar. Rather than simply liberal construction of remedial statutes, plaintiff\u2019s thesis would have us legislate authority for interminable pendency of lawsuits \u2014 from nonsuit to refiling in endless monotonous cycles \u2014 all within tidy yearly units of time. Plaintiff\u2019s alacrity in filing lawsuits is unmatched by his laxness resulting in a nonsuit and dismissal for want of prosecution.</p>\n<p id=\"b469-18\">Judgment affirmed.</p>\n<footnote label=\"1\">\n<p id=\"b468-15\">. Sections 13 and 15 S.H.A. ch. 83 are of ancient vintage having been enacted in 1872, April 4, Laws 1871-72, p. 556, \u00a7 12 and \u00a7 14 and have remained unaltered to date.</p>\n</footnote>\n</opinion>\n</casebody>\n",
