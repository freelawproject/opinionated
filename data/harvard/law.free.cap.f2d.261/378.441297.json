SIGLER, Appellant, v. MT. VERNON BOTTLING COMPANY, Inc., a corporation, Appellee.</parties>\n<docketnumber data-order=\"1\" data-type=\"docketnumber\" id=\"b434-21\">No. 14393.</docketnumber>\n<court data-order=\"2\" data-type=\"court\" id=\"b434-22\">United States Court of Appeals District of Columbia Circuit</court>\n<otherdate data-order=\"3\" data-type=\"otherdate\" id=\"b434-23\">Argued Oct. 16, 1958.</otherdate>\n<decisiondate data-order=\"4\" data-type=\"decisiondate\" id=\"b434-24\">Decided Oct. 30, 1958.</decisiondate>\n<attorneys data-order=\"5\" data-type=\"attorneys\" id=\"b435-7\"><page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"379\">*379</page-number>Mr. Herman Miller, Washington, D.

The defense raised is the statute of limitations<footnotemark>1</footnotemark> and the issue is whether the note is a sealed instrument. If it is a sealed instrument, it is not barred by the statute of limitations ; if it is not a sealed instrument, it is so barred. The District Court ruled<footnotemark>2</footnotemark> that the note was not a sealed instrument and judgment was entered for the appellee.</p>\n<p id=\"b435-18\">The note was signed \u201cMount Vernon Bottling Co. By Andrew G. Kavounis, Sec.-Treas.\u201d and the corporate seal was impressed through the name of the corporation and that of the secretary-treasurer. The instrument was on a printed stationer\u2019s form headed \u201cPromissory Note.\u201d Nowhere does the word or symbol \u201cSeal\u201d or \u201cL.S.\u201d appear; nowhere is there a recital that the instrument is \u201csigned and sealed.\u201d The District Court ruled that whether the note was or was not a sealed instrument was a question for determination by the court and not by the jury, and that where a seal is used the intention of the maker is controlling and is to be determined by the court from an examination by the court of the instrument itself.

Hooper, 1896, 160 U.S. 514, 515, 16 S.Ct. 379, 40 L.Ed. 515.</p>\n<p id=\"b435-19\">An examination of the note leads us to conclude, as did the District Court, that under the circumstances of this case \u201cthe intention of the maker was not to create <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"380\">*380</page-number>a specialty with its attendant liability for twelve years, but that the seal was impressed for identification and as a mark of genuineness, and also to give certain knowledge that the note was an obligation of the corporation and no one else.\u201d [158 F.Supp. 236.] Cf., Brown v.
