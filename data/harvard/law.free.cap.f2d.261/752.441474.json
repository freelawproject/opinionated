Appellant asked that the court issue a preliminary and permanent mandatory injunction requiring appellees (defendants) to restore appellant to his employment in the United States Post Office Department, retroactive to the date of his dismissal. Appellant was dismissed by a Notification of Personnel Action emanating from the Post Office Department, the grounds stated therein being:</p>\n<blockquote id=\"b809-14\">\u201cFor false and misleading statements in your civil service papers concerning separations from previous employments and experience, and other evidence of unsuitability for Government employment.\u201d</blockquote>\n<p id=\"b809-15\">It is conceded that the Civil Service Commission directed the removal action complained of.</p>\n<p id=\"b809-16\">While the suit was pending in the District Court, two of the defendant Civil Service Commissioners resigned from the Commission and their successors were not substituted as parties defendant within six months after taking oath of office, as required by Fed.R.Civ.P. 25(d), 28 U.S.C.A.<footnotemark>1</footnotemark> On motion, based on the failure to substitute indispensable parties, the District Court dismissed the complaint but without prejudice. Appellant contends that the complaint should not have been dismissed because the members of the Civil Service Commission were not in fact indispensable parties.</p>\n<p id=\"b809-17\">We believe that under the circumstances of this case the Civil Service Commissioners were indispensable parties to the suit and, they not being be<page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"754\">*754</page-number>fore the court, the action was properly-dismissed.
