The appeal was dismissed pursuant to a notice of election by appellee to have all further proceedings conducted as provided in 35 U.S.C. \u00a7 146.</p>\n<p id=\"b495-20\">The instant appeal was taken from a decision of the Assistant Commissioner reversing a decision of the Examiner of Interferences and dismissing appellant\u2019s opposition to the registration by appellee of the word \u201cJuliette\u201d as a trademark for ladies\u2019 electric razors. The opposition was based on various registrations owned by appellant including No. 371,-424 for \u201cGillette\u201d and No. 409,066 for \u201cJilet,\u201d applied to electric shavers.</p>\n<p id=\"b495-21\">In the decision appealed from the Assistant Commissioner stated that:</p>\n<blockquote id=\"b495-22\">\u201cThe sole question presented is whether or not applicant\u2019s mark \u2018Juliette,\u2019 when used on ladies\u2019 electric razors so resembles opposer\u2019s \u2018Gillette\u2019 marks as to be likely to cause confusion, mistake or deception\u201d and that:</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b495-23\">\u201c * * * it is concluded that applicant\u2019s mark is not likely to cause purchaser confusion, or mistake.\u201d</blockquote>\n<p id=\"b495-24\">Prior to the quoted statements, however, the decision contains the following:</p>\n<blockquote id=\"ahq-dedup-0\">\u201cOpposer\u2019s record establishes pri-ma facie abandonment of \u2018Gillette\u2019 <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"440\">*440</page-number>for electric shavers, as set forth in Reg. 371,424, and of \u2018Jilet\u2019 as shown by Reg. No. 409,066.\u201d</blockquote>\n<p id=\"b496-4\">The reasons of appeal to which the instant request for reconsideration relates are directed to the last-quoted portion of the decision. It is contended by appellant that the question of abandonment of registrations Nos. 371,424 and 409,066 was not before the Assistant Commissioner inter partes and that the last-quoted statement is therefore an ex parte decision as to which the election provision in 35 U.S.C. \u00a7 141 and 15 U.S.C. \u00a7 1071 is inapplicable, citing Baxter Laboratories v. Don Baxter, Inc., 186 F.2d 511, 38 C.C.P.A., Patents, 786.</p>\n<p id=\"b496-5\">It appears, however, from the above-quoted portions of the decision, that no actual holding was made that either of the marks of registrations 371,424 and 409,066 was abandoned.</p>\n<p id=\"b496-7\">Under the circumstances above set forth, we are of the opinion that there is no ex parte question presented which would justify the retention by this court of any part of the instant appeal.</p>\n<p id=\"b496-8\">The order of dismissal has been reconsidered as requested but no reason is found for modifying it and appellant\u2019s motion for modification of it is accordingly denied.</p>\n<p id=\"b496-9\">Pursuant to appellant\u2019s motion to stay mandate, which accompanied the request for reconsideration, the mandate has been withheld until the date of the instant decision.</p>\n</opinion>\n</casebody>\n",
