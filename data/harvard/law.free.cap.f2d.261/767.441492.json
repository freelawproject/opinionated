The court expressly determined, however, in accordance with Rule 54(b) of the Federal Rules of Civil Procedure,<footnotemark>1</footnotemark> there was no just reason for delay as to the counterclaim. This appeal is from the judgment awarded on the matured notes.</p>\n<p id=\"b823-19\">The claims of the appellants remain undetermined, and are not affected by the judgment on the counterclaim.
