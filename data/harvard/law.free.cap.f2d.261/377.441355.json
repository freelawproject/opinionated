This appeal followed.</p>\n<p id=\"b434-12\">The liability of an employer for injuries to employees is limited to the compensation provided in the Compensation Act. To allow recovery by the wife, under the circumstances of this case, would extend that liability contrary to the plain provisions of the Act. Cf., Smither &amp; Co. v. Coles, 1957, 100 U.S.App.D.C. 68, 242 F.2d 220; Underwood v. United States, 10 Cir., 1953, 207 F.2d 862. We agree with the District Court that appellant has no right to maintain her action against the employer.</p>\n<p id=\"b434-16\">It is not necessary for us to pass upon appellee\u2019s claim that \u201c [acceptance of consideration in return for an unconditional release to a tortfeasor constitutes a bar to an action against any other person who may be severally or jointly liable.\u201d</p>\n<p id=\"b434-17\">Affirmed.</p>\n<footnote label=\"1\">\n<p id=\"b434-13\">. \u00a7 36-501, D.C.Code (1951). It is not disputed that appellee employer had secured insurance for the payment of compensation to its employees, including appellant\u2019s husband, as required by the statute.</p>\n</footnote>\n</opinion>\n</casebody>\n",
