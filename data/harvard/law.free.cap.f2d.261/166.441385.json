Emil Anderson and Son, Inc., to build an addition to its plant. Anderson subcontracted the major construction work to Fruin-Colnon Contracting Company and subcontracted certain tank work to Wendnagel &amp; Company, including the manufacture and erection of an outside wooden tank. Fruin-Colnon employs members of Carpenters Local 60, a respondent, herein called the Carpenters; Wendnagel is under contract with Local 67 of the Coopers International Union of North America, AFL-CIO, and employs members of that union, herein called the Coopers.</p>\n<p id=\"b223-10\">The contract between Wendnagel and the Coopers does not assign and is not an agreement to assign the disputed work (erection of tanks or towers) to members of the Coopers. Rather, it provides that in localities where the Coopers have no membership the disputed work may be carried on with such men as are available, with union preference, provided one member of the Coopers is employed.</p>\n<p id=\"b223-13\">Wendnagel\u2019s principal plant is in Chicago, Illinois. The work dispute arose in Indianapolis, Indiana. It is not denied that the Wendnagel employees assigned to the disputed work were employees of Wendnagel in Chicago. There is no evidence that the Coopers had any members in the locality of Indianapolis.</p>\n<p id=\"b223-14\">On April 10, 1956, Wendnagel\u2019s employees began to erect an outside wooden tank. Paul Bear, steward of Carpenters Local 60 and a carpenter employee of Fruin-Colnon, telephoned the local\u2019s business agent, Chester A. Bereman, and asked him to investigate the job because Wendnagel was installing the tank without carpenters. Bereman promptly came to the job site, looked the tank over, and then telephoned Cecil Shuey, representative of respondent Carpenters\u2019 International. Acting pursuant to Shuey\u2019s instructions, Bereman then told Wendnagel foreman Charles Wawak that the work on the tank belonged to the Carpenters. Wawak offered to do the job with a composite crew of carpenters and coopers but Bereman, after further advice from Shuey, rejected the compromise and stated that, if the Coopers went on the job, the Carpenters would not work at the job site. Bereman then instructed steward Bear to pull the Carpenters off the job the next morning if the Coopers resumed work on the tank.</p>\n<p id=\"b223-15\">Bereman also told Pierson, vice-president of Fruin-Colnon, of the Carpenters\u2019 decision to quit work unless given the tank job. Pierson and Bereman then drove to the office of Shuey who reiterated that the Carpenters would not work alongside the Coopers. Pierson trans<page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"168\">*168</page-number>mitted this information to the prime contractor, Anderson, who in turn urged Wendnagel to straighten the matter out so that the employees of Fruin-Colnon, members of the Carpenters, would not be pulled off the job. Later that day, Wend-nagel\u2019s attorney, John T. Van Aken, called Shuey and repeated foreman Wawak\u2019s earlier offer to compromise the dispute by hiring carpenters to work with Wendnagel\u2019s coopers. He reminded Shuey that past disputes between the Carpenters and the Coopers had been so handled. Shuey insisted, however, that except for supervision, the work had to foe done exclusively by carpenters. The next morning, April 11, the Coopers resumed work on the wooden tank and steward Bear ordered Fruin-Colnon\u2019s carpenters off the job.</p>\n<p id=\"b224-4\">Sometime between April 11 and April 18,1956, R. R. Smith, president of the respondent Carpenters\u2019 District Council, offered to call off the strike if certain millwright work on the job site was given to members of the Carpenters. Nothing came of this offer and on April 17, the Carpenters received notice of the unfair labor practice charges filed by Wendnagel in this case. Thereupon, pursuant to advice from Shuey, Bereman and Smith directed steward Bear to put the Carpenters back to work. The Carpenters reported for work the next morning and the Coopers completed the tank work.</p>\n<p id=\"b224-5\">Respondents in this court contend that the record establishes that respondents\u2019 object in removing members of respondent Local 60 employed by Fruin-Colnon from their jobs was to obtain assignment of the disputed work by Wendnagel to members of respondent Local 60 and further that there is no evidence in the record of any other object of respondents, and in particular there is no evidence that respondents had as an object the replacement of Wendnagel as a subcontractor on the job.</p>\n<p id=\"b224-6\">The unfair labor practice charges filed in April 1956 alleged that respondents and their named agents had violated section 8(b)(4)(D), 29 U.S.C.A. \u00a7 158(b) (4) (D), the \u201cjurisdictional disputes\u201d section, as well as section 8(b)(4)(A), the \u201csecondary boycott\u201d section, of the Act.</p>\n<p id=\"b224-8\">Pursuant to the statutory scheme for the handling of jurisdictional disputes, the Board in June 1956 held the hearing prescribed by section 10(k), 29 U.S.C.A. \u00a7 160 (k) \u201cto hear and determine the dispute\u201d out of which the charge of a section 8(b)(4)(D) violation arose.</p>\n<p id=\"b224-9\">On the basis of the foregoing facts, the Board found that the record \u201cdoes not show that Wendnagel\u2019s assignment of the wooden tank work was in contravention of any Board order or certificate; nor does it show that the Carpenters had any bargaining contract with Wendnagel which would entitle the Carpenters to represent such employees\u201d, and that, on the contrary, \u201cCoopers, whose members were employd by Wendnagel, was under contract with Wendnagel as the recognized bargaining representative for these employees.\u201d</p>\n<p id=\"b224-10\">Under the heading \u201cMerits of the Dispute\u201d, the Board said that it is \u201cwell established that an employer is free to make work assignments without being subjected to pressures proscribed by section 8 (b) (4) (D), \u2018unless such employer is failing to conform to an order or certification of the Board determining the bargaining-representative for employees performing such work.\u2019 \u201d</p>\n<p id=\"b224-11\">The Board\u2019s decision reads in part, as follows:</p>\n<blockquote id=\"b224-12\">\u201cWe therefore find that the Carpenters was not entitled by means proscribed by section 8(b) (4) (D) to force or require Wendnagel to assign the disputed work to carpenters, to the exclusion of other employees.\u201d Under the heading \u201cDetermination of</blockquote>\n<p id=\"as-dedup-0\">Dispute\u201d, the decision reads:</p>\n<blockquote id=\"b224-13\">\u201cOn the basis of the foregoing findings of fact and upon the entire record in this case, the Board makes the following determination of dispute, pursuant to section 10 (k) of the Act.</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b224-14\">\u201c1. [Respondents] and their agents, are not and have not been lawfully entitled to force or require <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"169\">*169</page-number>Wendnagel &amp; Company to assign the work of constructing or erecting wood tanks or vats to members of said labor organizations rather than to Wendnagel\u2019s own employees.</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"Ast\"><em>\u201c2. </em>Within ten (10) days from the date of this Decision and Determination of Dispute, said unions and their agents, as named above, shall notify the Regional Director for the Ninth Region, in writing whether or not they will refrain from forcing or requiring Wendnagel &amp; Company, by means proscribed by Section 8(b) (4) (D) of the Act, to assign the work in dispute to members of the Carpenters rather than to employees of Wendnagel.\u201d</blockquote>\n<p id=\"b225-6\">The Board\u2019s General Counsel filed an amended consolidated complaint charging respondents with unfair labor practices within the meaning of \u00a7 8(b) (4) (A) and \u00a7 8(b)(4)(D) of the Act. The charges were denied by respondents\u2019 answer.</p>\n<p id=\"b225-7\">After an interim report was made by a trial examiner, a review was had by the Board, which found that respondents had violated the Act as charged. The Board ordered <footnotemark><em>2</em></footnotemark><em> </em>respondents to cease and desist</p>\n<blockquote id=\"A75\">\u201cfrom engaging in, or inducing or encouraging the employees of Fruin-Colnon Contracting Company or the employees of any other employer to engage in, a strike or concerted refusal in the course of their employment to use, manufacture, process, transport, or otherwise handle or work on any goods, articles, materials, or commodities, or to perform any services where an object thereof is (a) to force Fruin-Colnon Contracting Company or any other employer to cease doing business with Wendnagel &amp; Company or any other employer, or (b) to force or require Wendnagel &amp; Company or any other employer to assign particular work to members of the Respondents rather than to other employees, except insofar as any such action is permitted under Section 8(b) (4) (D) of the Act.\u201d</blockquote>\n<p id=\"b225-12\">Section 8(b) (4) (D) of the Act,<footnotemark>3</footnotemark> so far as here relevant, makes it an unfair labor practice for a labor organization or its agents</p>\n<blockquote id=\"b225-13\">\u201cto engage in, or to induce or encourage the employees of any employer to engage in, a strike * * * where an object thereof is: * * * forcing or requiring any employer to assign particular work to employees in a particular labor organization or in a particular trade, craft, or class rather than to employees in another labor organization or in another trade, craft, or class, unless such employer is failing to conform to art order or certification of the Board determining the bargaining representative for employees performing such work * *</blockquote>\n<p id=\"b225-16\">Section 10(k) <footnotemark>4</footnotemark> of the Act, reads:</p>\n<blockquote id=\"AbE\">\u201cWhenever it is charged that any person has engaged in an unfair labor practice within the meaning of paragraph (4)(D) of section 158 (b) of this title, the Board is empowered and directed to hear and, determine the dispute out of which such unfair labor practice shall have arisen, unless, within ten days after notice that such charge has been filed, the parties to such dispute submit to the Board satisfactory evidence that they have adjusted, or agreed upon methods for the voluntary adjustment of, the dispute. Upon compliance by the parties to the dispute with the decision of the Board or upon such voluntary adjustment of the dispute, such charge shall be dismissed.\u201d</blockquote>\n<p id=\"b225-17\">1. Insofar as the charge against respondents is based on alleged violation of \u00a7 8(b) (4) (D), it was necessary for the Board to hold a hearing as prescribed by \u00a7 10 (k). This was done. It was necessary that this hearing should culminate <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"170\">*170</page-number>in an order determining the dispute out of which the charged violation of \u00a7 8(b) (4) (D) arose. N. L. R. B. v. United Ass\u2019n of Journeymen, 3 Cir., 242 F.2d 722, 724.</p>\n<p id=\"b226-4\">In deciding whether the Board so determined the dispute, we are required to consider not only the language of \u00a7 10 (k), but also the relevant rules of the Board.</p>\n<p id=\"b226-5\">These rules, which were in effect at the time of the \u00a7 10 (k) hearing herein,<footnotemark>5</footnotemark> provide, as follows:</p>\n<blockquote id=\"b226-6\">\u201c\u00a7 102.73 <em>Proceedings before the Board; further hearings; briefs; certification. </em>Upon the close of the hearing, the Board shall proceed * * * to <em>certify </em>the labor organization or the <em>particular </em>trade, craft, or class of employees, as the case may be, which shall perform the particular work tasks in-issue, or to make other disposition of the matter.</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"Aqr\">* *. \u25a0 *</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b226-9\">\u201c\u00a7 102.74 <em>Compliance with certification; further proceedings. </em>If, after issuance of <em>certification </em>by the Board, the parties submit to the regional director satisfactory evidence that they have complied with the <em>certification, </em>the regional director shall dismiss the charge.. If no satisfactory evidence of compliance is submitted, the regional director may proceed with the charge under paragraph (4)(D) of section 8(b) and section 10 of the act * * *.</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b226-10\">\u201c\u00a7 102.75 <em>Review of certification. </em>The record of the proceedings under section 10 (k) and the <em>certification </em>of the Board thereon, shall become a part of the record in such unfair labor practice proceeding and shall be subject to judicial review insofar as it is in issue, in proceedings to enforce or review the final order of the Board under 10(e) and (f) of the act.\u201d 29 U.S.C.A.Appendix. (Italics in body of rules supplied for emphasis.)</blockquote>\n<p id=\"b226-11\">These rules, insofar as they are consistent with the Act, are embodied in the law governing this case. \u00a7 102.73, supra, necessarily required the Board at the close of the \u00a7 10 (k) hearing to determine the labor organization or the particular trade, craft, or class of employees, as the case may be, which shall perform the particular work tasks in issue. This is true because \u00a7 102.73 requires the Board to certify its determination in that respect. While the rule offers an alternative to this certification by the language which permits the Board \u201cto make other disposition of the matter\u201d, nothing in the record suggests that the Board attempted or intended to make any disposition of the matter other than to determine it.</p>\n<p id=\"b226-12\">It is not disputed that the record fails to show that the Board certified its determination or any other action taken by it upon the close of the \u00a7 10 (k) hearing.</p>\n<p id=\"b226-13\">While the rationale of its decision is in part reflected by its statement that an employer is free to make work assignments, except as indicated, its Determination of Dispute fails to measure up to its own rule \u00a7 102.73, because it does not determine the labor organization or the particular trade, craft, or class of employees, as the case may be, which shall perform the particular work tasks in issue. This rule was as binding upon the Board itself as it was upon any other person or organization.</p>\n<p id=\"b226-14\">If it is to be assumed that the Board\u2019s determination definitely excluded the use of members of the Carpenters from the work on the tanks or vats, the order in the \u00a7 10 (k) proceeding lacks clarity in identifying who should perform the work. In effect, it excludes the Carpenters from the work and only obliquely suggests by the language \u201crather than to Wendnagel\u2019s own employees\u201d, who should do the work. Are these to be union men? Are they to be members of any particular union? Are they to be coopers? Could they be maintenance men, bricklayers, clerks, etc.?</p>\n<p id=\"b227-3\"><page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"171\">*171</page-number>An order under \u00a7 10 (k) must be clear and specific and actually be certified in such form, before a violation of \u00a7 10 (k) based upon such order will constitute an unfair labor practice. Such an order must be complete in itself; its incompleteness cannot be overcome by a resort to the reasoning of the decision which led to its entry.</p>\n<p id=\"b227-4\">Believing that the Board has not complied with \u00a7 10 (k) and its own rules applicable thereto, we hold that no violation of \u00a7 8(b)(4)(D) was established in this case.</p>\n<p id=\"b227-5\">2. In the order which we are now asked to enforce, the Board also concluded, contrary to the trial examiner, that respondents had violated \u00a7 8(b) (4) (A) of the Act.</p>\n<p id=\"b227-7\">In support of the Board\u2019s petition, it relies on the following part of \u00a7 8(b)(4) (A), which makes it an unfair labor practice for a labor organization or its agents</p>\n<blockquote id=\"b227-8\">\u201cto engage in, or to induce or encourage the employees of any employer to engage in, a strike * * * where an object thereof is: (A) forcing or requiring * * * any employer or other person * * * to cease doing business with any other person.\u201d</blockquote>\n<p id=\"b227-12\">We now state the Board\u2019s argument. Respondents\u2019 sole quarrel was with Wendnagel because Wendnagel refused to employ members of the Carpenters to perform the work called for by its subcontract. Respondents had no quarrel with Fruin-Colnon. Nevertheless, respondents brought about a cessation of the latter\u2019s operations and inevitably involved both Fruin-Colnon and Anderson, the prime contractor responsible for the completion of the project, in a controversy in which they had no part. It is of no moment whether respondents\u2019 ultimate goal in calling the strike was to bring pressure upon Wendnagel through Fruin-Colnon and Anderson to reassign the tank work to members of the Carpenters or whether the ultimate goal was to replace Wendnagel with a different subcontractor who would utilize members of the Carpenters. In either case the statutory prerequisites for a \u00a7 8(b)(4)(A) violation are satisfied.</p>\n<p id=\"b227-14\">However, we fail to find any evidence that the object of respondents was to force Anderson to replace Wendnagel with a different subcontractor who would use members of the Carpenters. The Board in this case said that</p>\n<blockquote id=\"b227-15\">\u201cthe record in fact clearly indicates that the Respondents alternatively intended their strike against Fruin to be the means of forcing Wend-nagel\u2019s replacement. Thus the Respondents at all times insisted that their members would not work so long as Wendnagel\u2019s Coopers remained on the job.\u201d</blockquote>\n<p id=\"b227-16\">There is no evidence in the record that respondents ever requested or suggested Wendnagel\u2019s replacement. It is true that the evidence shows that respondents insisted that their members would not work so long as <em>Wendnagel\u2019s coopers </em>remained on the job, but that is quite a different thing from their insisting that they would not work so long as <em>Wendnagel </em>remained on the job. In short, there is no evidence<footnotemark>6</footnotemark> to justify the Board\u2019s conclusion that the above-quoted language from \u00a7 8(b)(4)(A) was violated by respondents.</p>\n<p id=\"b227-17\">The Board is mistaken in relying on N. L. R. B. v. Denver Bldg. &amp; Const. Trades Council, 341 U.S. 675, 71 S.Ct. 943, 95 L.Ed. 1284. In that case there was a long standing labor dispute between the Building Council and Gould &amp; Preisner due to the latter\u2019s practice of employing <em>non-union </em>men on construction jobs in Denver. Doose &amp; Lintner was the general contractor for the construction of a commercial building. Gould &amp; Preisner was a subcontractor thereon and its employees were the only non-union workmen on the project. The Building Council commenced a strike at the project and Doose &amp; Lintner notified Gould &amp; Preisner to get off the job. Its <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"172\">*172</page-number>workmen were denied entrance. On charges by Gould &amp; Preisner, the Board issued a complaint against respondents, alleging that the object of the strike was to force the general contractor to cease to do business with Gould &amp; Preisner on that project. The court said, at page 688 of 341 U.S., at page 951 of 71 S.Ct.:</p>\n<blockquote id=\"b228-4\">\u201cThe only way that respondents could attain their purpose was to force Gould &amp; Preisner itself off the job. This, in turn, could be done only through Doose &amp; Lintner\u2019s termination of Gould &amp; Preisner\u2019s subcontract. The result is that the Council\u2019s strike, in order to attain its ultimate purpose, must have included among its objects that of forcing Doose &amp; Lintner to terminate that subcontract.\u201d</blockquote>\n<p id=\"b228-5\">And, in conformity with a Board finding, the court said at page 689 of 341 U.S., at page 951 of 71 S.Ct.:</p>\n<blockquote id=\"b228-6\">\u201cIt was an object of the strike to force the contractor to terminate Gould &amp; Preisner\u2019s subcontract.\u201d</blockquote>\n<p id=\"b228-7\">In contrast, in the case at bar we are not dealing with a non-union subcontractor. Wendnagel\u2019s coopers are union men. No reason existed in the case at bar for the replacement of Wendnagel, and respondents never demanded it. That was not their object in striking against Fruin-Colnon. They demanded only that members of Carpenters be employed by Wendnagel on the work in question rather than members of Coopers. That was their object in striking against Fruin-Colnon. They believed that their strike, by means of Anderson\u2019s influence over Wendnagel, would cause the replacement of the coopers by respondents\u2019 carpenters.</p>\n<p id=\"b228-8\">In Douds v. International Longshoremen\u2019s Ass\u2019n, 2 Cir., 224 F.2d 455, 459, Judge Hand said:</p>\n<blockquote id=\"b228-9\">\u201c * * * The \u2018object\u2019 of an action is the concluding state of things that the actor seeks to bring about: that which satisfies his aim. Hence it is a term relative to the whole sequence of steps that he proposes; and it does not apply to those that are only intermediate to it. * * \u201d</blockquote>\n<p id=\"AH_\">For the reasons herein set forth, we hold that the Board\u2019s order of February 5, 1958 is not supported by the record before us and that we would not be justified in enforcing it. That order is set aside. 29 U.S.C.A. \u00a7 160(e).</p>\n<p id=\"b228-11\">Enforcement refused and order set aside.</p>\n<footnote label=\"1\">\n<p id=\"b223-11\">.
