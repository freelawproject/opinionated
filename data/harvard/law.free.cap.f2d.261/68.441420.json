Judgment having been entered in favor of the Commission, this appeal followed.</p>\n<p id=\"b125-10\">The complaint charged that appellant had been guilty of \u201cmisconduct\u201d in that while a duly licensed and registered doctor and surgeon he had on or about November 23, 1954, prescribed or administered a drug or had used an instrument on the person of a pregnant woman with the intent of procuring a miscarriage, as a result of which the woman had a miscarriage and died three days later. The trial judge found the appellant guilty accordingly, but not guilty in two other charged particulars: (1) of having visited the deceased, but denying he had done so; and (2) of failing to notify the police or the coroner of her death.</p>\n<p id=\"b125-16\">Appellant here complains of error in four respects. First, he charges the finding that he committed the abortion is clearly erroneous and rests upon insufficient grounds. Next he argues that the statutory term \u201cmisconduct\u201d is too vague and indefinite to meet the requirements of due process, and that revocation of a doctor\u2019s license may be had only under D.C. Code \u00a7 2-131 (1951) <footnotemark>2</footnotemark> following conviction of a felony. Finally, he challenges, because of the prohibition against wire tapping,<footnotemark>3</footnotemark> the admission of details of two telephonic conversations as part of testimony by a police officer who listened on a telephone extension while a material witness talked by telephone to the appellant.</p>\n<p id=\"b125-17\">I</p>\n<p id=\"b125-18\">The trial court\u2019s findings of fact emerged from a conflict which it was singularly the duty of the trial judge to resolve. Our review discloses substantial evidence of record from which the trier might fairly conclude that the decedent had been aborted and that the appellant had undertaken to, and did, perform whatever acts were involved. That the decedent died as a result is beyond peradventure. We cannot say that the court\u2019s findings have been shown to be clearly erroneous, indeed a careful examination of the transcript leads us to agreement with the findings of the trier and the conclusions based thereon.</p>\n<p id=\"b125-19\">II</p>\n<p id=\"b125-20\">The Code\u2019s use of the word \u201cmisconduct\u201d <footnotemark>4</footnotemark> seems at first reading to pre<page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"70\">*70</page-number>sent a problem in that no statutory, standards <em>to- govern </em>its present application have been set\u2019forth. When we perceive, however,, that the statute permits; revocation upon this ground. only after the institution-of\u2018action in the United States District Court for the District of Columbia sitting as a court of equity, we first may fairly look to the act as a whole, its purpose and objectives, and then to the complaint itself and to the pleadings of record.' In this perspective, we observe, Paragraph 3 of the complaint was quite specific in that the \u201cmisconduct\u201d charged had been spelled out in the words of the criminal statute which defines the offense.<footnotemark>5</footnotemark> Surely appellant may not be heard to say that the allegations as to the particular offense are not sufficiently stated.<footnotemark>6</footnotemark></p>\n<p id=\"b126-4\">There was no claim at the trial that appellant had not been fully apprised of the nature of the offense. Had he been in doubt as to particulars either to enable him to plead or to prepare for trial, he might have moved for a more definite statement under the Rule.<footnotemark>7</footnotemark></p>\n<p id=\"b126-5\">There has been no claim of variance between the allegations and the proof. There is no suggestion that the complaint and the evidence offered to support it had involved elements of surprise prejudicial to the appellant\u2019s case.<footnotemark>8</footnotemark> It is not argued that the statute transcends the power of Congress or that practitioners of medicine may not be regulated.<footnotemark>9</footnotemark> It is argued, and the point.is raised here for the,first time, that the statute is \u201cso vague and indefinite as to violate the requirements of due process.\u201d</p>\n<p id=\"b126-15\">After providing that, the District Court sitting as \u00bf 'court of . equity may revoke a license where the licentiate \u201chas been guilty of misconduct or is professionally incapacitated,\u201d <footnotemark>10</footnotemark> the Code continues that proceedings shall be commenced, by verified petition. \u201cProceedings shall be conducted according to the ordinary rules of equity practice and such supplementary rules as said [District Court] may deem expedient to carry into effect <em>the </em>purpose and intent <em>of this </em>chapter.\u201d The Court is authorized to determine whether a license shall be suspended or revoked. Its decision is subject to appeal to this court.</p>\n<p id=\"b126-16\">The \u201cHealing Arts Practice Act, District of Columbia, 1928\u201d <footnotemark>11</footnotemark> repealed the earlier act governing the practice of medicine and surgery in the District<footnotemark>12</footnotemark> which by its section 10 had committed revocation to a board of medical supervisors. The'board had been authorized to act for various causes, such as the \u201cemployment of fraud or deception in passing the examinations * * * chronic inebriety, the practice of criminal abortion, conviction of crime involving moral turpitude, or unprofessional or dishonorable conduct.\u201d<footnotemark>13</footnotemark> The present act elimi<page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"71\">*71</page-number>nated the board of medical supervisors as judges in revocation proceedings and substituted the United States District Court, sitting as a court of equity. The licentiate in every case has available to him the full protection of the Federal Rules. \u201cMisconduct\u201d as a ground for suspension or revocation is not left as a matter of opinion<footnotemark>14</footnotemark> but is susceptible to complete exposition under the Rules and requires proof as a matter of fact accordingly.</p>\n<p id=\"b127-5\">Nor can we doubt that every medical practitioner knows fully that the performance of a criminal abortion is misconduct.<footnotemark>15</footnotemark> He need not guess at the meaning of the term in view of his status and the Code which governs. \u201cThe reason of the law, as indicated by its general terms, should prevail over its letter, when the plain purpose of the act will be defeated by strict adherence to its verbiage.\u201d <footnotemark>15</footnotemark> The purpose of the statute here is clear and calls for no further exploration into semantics.<footnotemark>17</footnotemark> Congress intended to provide a remedial measure for the protection of the public,<footnotemark>18</footnotemark> and \u201cmisconduct\u201d certainly included, and must have</p>\n<p id=\"b127-12\">been known by a medical practitioner to have included, the performance of an illegal abortion<footnotemark>19</footnotemark></p>\n<p id=\"b127-13\">We need not rest upon the foregoing for quite apart from what has been said, the appellant failed in the District Court to raise any question as to the constitutionality of the statute. Accordingly, we go no further into this aspect of the case.<footnotemark>20</footnotemark></p>\n<p id=\"b127-14\">Ill</p>\n<p id=\"b127-15\">It is insisted that, in any event, resort may not be had to proceedings under D.C. Code \u00a7 2-123 (1951), for revocation may be ordered only after <em>conviction </em>of a felony. We are pointed to D.C. Code \u00a7 2-T31 which provides that if one licensed \u201cbe convicted in the District Court of the United States for the District of Columbia of any felony, the court, without further hearing or procedure, may suspend * * * or may revoke, the license * * * of the defendant, in addition to imposing any other penalty provided by law.\u201d This section simply provides an <em>additional </em>remedy and for summary action when a <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"72\">*72</page-number>licentiate shall <em>here </em>have been convicted of \u201cany\u201d felony. It is clear that any such conviction is to be deemed to establish without more, the unfitness of the licentiate to continue to hold a license. The section avoids circuity and duplication in proceedings.<footnotemark>21</footnotemark> Dispelled is all necessity for weighing offenses involving moral turpitude and like considerations.<footnotemark>22</footnotemark> Moreover, the felony to predicate any such summary forfeiture must have been committed <em>in the District of Columbia, </em>where as proceedings under D.C. Code \u00a7 2-123, may rest upon a comparable offense committed in nearby Virginia, where appellant also had an office, or elsewhere, with or without conviction.<footnotemark>23</footnotemark> The appellant has mistakenly argued that a conviction of \u201cany felony\u201d is a prerequisite to an equity proceeding for revocation under \u00a7 2-123.</p>\n<blockquote id=\"b127-19\"><page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"71\">*71</page-number>16.

Petrillo, 1947, 332 U.S. 1, 7, 67 S.Ct. 1538, 91 L.Ed. 1877.</blockquote>\n<p id=\"b128-4\"><page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"72\">*72</page-number>IV</p>\n<p id=\"b128-5\">Detective-sergeant Gosman was permitted, over appellant\u2019s objection, to relate the details of a telephone conversation between appellant and one Matthews who had told appellant of the pregnancy of the deceased woman and who then arranged to bring the woman to appellant\u2019s office. Matthews at the police headquarters had given a statement to officers of the homicide squad. Thereafter, while still at headquarters, with the officer on an extension telephone as Matthews knew, he phoned the appellant who was in his own office. Matthews told the appellant he had been questioned throughout the entire day by the police and that he was seared.</p>\n<p id=\"b128-9\">\u201cDr. Ladrey told Matthews to come to his office,\u201d the officer testified, and then appellant hung up the telephone.</p>\n<p id=\"b128-10\">\u201cMatthews made a second telephone call in the same manner,\u201d and (we omit some detail) \u201cDr. Ladrey told Matthews to catch a taxicab and come directly to his office on N Street.\u201d After further conversation, \u201cDr. Ladrey asked Matthews if he was sure he wasn't being followed by the police. He stated he was sure he wasn\u2019t being followed by the police.\u201d</p>\n<p id=\"b128-11\">When appellant was interviewed by the officer, \u201cHe admitted most of the conversation,\u201d but denied asking \u201cAre you sure you are not being followed by the police\u201d [?]</p>\n<p id=\"b128-12\">So ran the testimony which appellant urges was erroneously admitted on the ground \u201cthat Gosman\u2019s monitoring on an extension telephone constituted wire tapping.\u201d He argues that \u201cMatthews\u2019 \u2018acquiescence\u2019 to Gosman\u2019s listening can hardly be equated with \u2018authorizing\u2019 him to listen,\u201d and that \u201cthere is no circumstance which will support the theory that Matthews <em>authorized </em>Gosman to <em>divulge </em>the conversation.\u201d Thus the <em>statute</em><footnotemark><em>24</em></footnotemark><em> </em>was violated, he claims, in that the appellant had not authorized the officer to \u201cintercept\u201d and to \u201cdivulge\u201d the intercepted communication.<footnotemark>25</footnotemark></p>\n<p id=\"b128-13\">We must reject his contention. No one is bound to answer a ringing telephone. <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"73\">*73</page-number>If he does pick up the receiver, he is not required to talk to the outside caller. If he chooses to talk, he may well understand that the calling party, the original \u201csender,\u201d may have others listening to the conversation, whether in a group around the caller\u2019s telephone or on an extension attached to it. Quite apart from any such observations, the Supreme Court has passed upon the point,<footnotemark>26</footnotemark> adversely to appellant\u2019s claim. \u201cEach party to a telephone conversation takes the risk that the other party may have an extension telephone and may allow another to overhear the conversation. When such takes place there has been no violation of any privacy of which the parties may complain.\u201d<footnotemark>27</footnotemark> The Court held squarely that Section 605 had not been violated, for there had been no \u201cinterception\u201d as Congress intended the word to be used. We need go no further.</p>\n<p id=\"b129-5\">We reviewed this case <em>en banc </em>because of the importance of various aspects of the appellant\u2019s case. After extensive consideration of the several points, we are satisfied there is no error.</p>\n<p id=\"b129-6\">Affirmed.</p>\n<footnote label=\"1\">\n<p id=\"b125-11\">. D.C.

If that testimony was inadmissible the Government does not contend that it was not prejudicial. The testimony recounted two telephone conversations between appellant and one Matthews, the paramour of the deceased woman upon whom the abortion was allegedly committed, to which police listened on an extension telephone. The calls were made by Matthews from the office of the Homicide Squad where he was being questioned. He knew \u2014 but appellant did not know \u2014 that the police were listening to the conversations. Upon defense counsel\u2019s objection to Sergeant Gosman\u2019s testimony as \u201cwire tap evidence\u201d the trial judge ruled the testimony admissible because \u201cone of the parties acquiesced in the conversation being intercepted.\u201d He said it did \u201cnot make any difference\u201d to his finding of acquiescence that this party was in the custody and control of the police.</p>\n<p id=\"b129-10\">Section 605 of the Federal Communications Act, 48 Stat. 1103, 47 U.S.C.A. \u00a7 605, commands that \u201c * * * no person not being authorized by the sender shall intercept any communication and divulge or publish the existence, contents, substance, purport, effect, or meaning of such intercepted communication to any person * * * \".</p>\n<p id=\"b129-12\">The question is whether Sergeant Gosman \u201cintercepted\u201d the communications between Matthews and the appellant. The majority treats the Supreme Court\u2019s recent decision in Rathbun v. United States, 1957, 355 U.S. 107, 78 S.Ct. 161, 2 L.Ed.2d 134, as dispositive of this issue. I disagree. In Rathbun, one Sparks, a telephone subscriber, expected a long distance call threatening his life. He \u201crequested\u201d the police to overhear the conversation on his telephone extension, and they complied with his request. 355 U.S. at page 108, 78 S.Ct. at page 162. The request was voluntary in every sense. The Supreme Court held that compliance with the request was not an \u201cinterception.\u201d The present case is quite different. There is nothing to suggest that Matthews, who telephoned to the present appellant, invited or requested the police to listen to the conversations. On the contrary, it is quite as likely that the plan to have the police listen and even the plan to have Matthews telephone to the appellant, originated with the police. It is not even clear that Matthews freely consented, though he did at least submit. <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"74\">*74</page-number>He was not using his telephone but a police telephone. There is nothing to suggest that he could have prevented them from using their own telephone in their own way. In other words, there is no evidence that'he could have made the calls without their listening to it. It does not even appear that they consulted him instead of merely telling him they were going to listen. In my opinion the Rathbun rule, that there is no interception of a telephone conversation when one party to it invites a third person to listen, has no application to these facts.</p>\n<p id=\"b130-4\">Since the record does not show whether or not there was interception, I would vacate the judgment and remand the case to the District Court for reconsideration upon a supplemented record.</p>\n<p id=\"b130-5\">In that disposition of the case it is not necessary to reach the constitutional question of the validity of the license revocation statute. But, since I read the majority as deciding that question, it is permissible to record my dissent from its conclusion.</p>\n<p id=\"b130-6\">The statute, D.C.Code \u00a7 2-123, authorizes the District Court to revoke a doctor\u2019s license \u201cupon evidence showing to the satisfaction of the court that [he] has been guilty of <em>misconduct </em>* Emphasis supplied. No one, I suppose, would suggest that Congress may validly authorize the District Court to convict an individual of a crime and sentence him to fine or imprisonment for being guilty of \u201cmisconduct.\u201d Such a stand-ardless criminal statute would obviously be void for vagueness. And, as this court has said, \u201cthe principles that apply in the protection of\u201d a doctor\u2019s right to practice his profession \u201care of the same general nature, though not in all particulars, as those which safeguard him when prosecuted for the commission of a minor offense.\u201d Czarra v. Board of Medical Supervisors, 1905, 25 App.D.C. 443, 454.</p>\n<p id=\"b130-7\">In Czarra, we held invalid the predecessor statute of D.C.Code \u00a7 2-123 which authorized license revocation on a finding of \u201cunprofessional or dishonorable conduct.\u201d</p>\n<p id=\"b130-8\">We said:</p>\n<blockquote id=\"Al\">\u201cDoubtless all intelligent and fair-minded persons would agree in the opinion of the board of medical supervisors that the act charged against the appellant in the case at bar amounted to conduct both unprofessional and dishonorable. But this is not the test of the validity of the particular clause of the statute. The underlying question involved in all cases that may arise is whether the courts can uphold and enforce a statute whose broad and indefinite language may apply not only to a particular act about which there would be little or no difference of opinion, but equally to others about which there might be radical differences, thereby devolving upon the tribunals charged with the enforcement of the law the exercise of an arbitrary power of discriminating between the several classes of acts.\u201d 25 App.D.C. at page 453.</blockquote>\n<p id=\"b130-10\">We concluded that the standard provided \u2014\u201cunprofessional or dishonorable conduct\u201d \u2014 was essentially no standard at all. Yet that standard, in a statute dealing with the medical profession, is probably clearer and more definitive than the \u201cmisconduct\u201d standard provided by the instant statute. The earlier statute would at least exclude as a ground of revocation such misconduct as does not reflect on professional standing or personal hon- or. Under the present statute any misconduct \u2014 even traffic offenses \u2014 could, in the uncontrolled discretion of the District Court, serve as a basis for revoking a license.</p>\n</opinion>\n</casebody>\n",
