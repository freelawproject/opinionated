A 26-month delay between arraignment and trial on class A misdemeanor charges of aggravated harassment constitutes a denial of defendant\u2019s constitutional and statutory right to a speedy trial where the reason for the delay is the People\u2019s desire to try a related Supreme Court matter first. <em>(Klopfer v North Carolina, </em>386 US 213; <em>People v Prosser, </em>309 NY 353; <em>People v Ganci, </em>27 NY2d 418; <em>Barker v Wingo, </em>407 US 514; <em>Smith v Hooey, </em>393 US 374; <em>United States v Ewell, </em>383 US 116; <em>United States v Marion, </em>404 US 307; <em>Dickey v Florida, </em>398 US 30; <em>People v Winfrey, </em>20 NY2d 138.) II. The People should be estopped to deny that their conduct in soliciting and securing <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"174\">*174</page-number>defendant\u2019s consent to adjournment of his trial on misdemeanor charges for 26 months so defendant could testify for the People in a related pending Supreme Court matter first and suddenly reversing their position and insisting on going to trial against defendant first, constituted a breach of agreement, express or implied, with defendant to dismiss charges against him upon his testimony in the Supreme Court case and defendant\u2019s waiver, if any, of his constitutional right to a speedy trial by virtue of acquiescing in said adjournments should be vacated and withdrawn and charges against him should be dismissed. <em>(People v Dwight S., </em>29 NY2d 172; <em>Johnson v Zerbst, </em>304 US 458; <em>People v Mulligan, </em>24 NY2d 948; <em>People v White, </em>32 NY2d 393; <em>Santobello v New York, </em>404 US 257; <em>Machibroda v United States, </em>368 US 487; <em>Stevens v Marks, </em>383 US 234.) III. Conviction of defendant based on the claim that approximately 3,000 telephone calls were received during a six-month period but only one of which was traced to defendant\u2019s place of employment and where the trial took place 26 months after a single opportunity for the People\u2019s witnesses to see and speak to defendant is incredible as a matter of law and against the weight of the credible evidence. <em>(People v Hoffner, </em>208 Misc 117; <em>People v Acquaviva, </em>179 App Div 959.)</p>\n<attorneys data-order=\"5\" data-type=\"attorneys\" id=\"b212-5\"><em>Eugene Gold, District Attorney (Elliott Schulder </em>and <em>Martin I.

Cone at the Appellate Term states the <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"175\">*175</page-number>essential issue and the underlying grounds for his view: \"On this appeal from a conviction for aggravated harassment (Penal Law, \u00a7 240.30), the question presented is whether defendant\u2019s guilt was proven beyond a reasonable doubt. It is true that an appellate court is usually hesitant in overturning a jury verdict based strictly on the witness\u2019 credibility <em>(People v Atlas, </em>183 App Div 595, affd 230 NY 629). However, there are too many problems within the People\u2019s proof. First of all there is no claim that the place from where the calls were made was not open to the public. Therefore, anyone could have had access to it in order to make the phone calls. Further, the complainants testified that they received from 2,000 to 3,000 calls between the fall 1970 to winter 1971, but, they failed to make a complaint to anyone until February 2, 1971 when they complained to the telephone company. This seems to me to be an incredible story. Moreover, it seems as if the complainant is not an unbiased victim, but rather has an interest in the outcome of this case since some of his employees have been arrested on charges of assault and extortion against the defendant. It is undisputed that the complaint against this defendant was first made some 8 days after the arrest of complainants\u2019 employees on charges of extortion and robbery made on complaint of this defendant. Furthermore, their claim, that the calls were obscene, was never substantiated by the phone company, since the phone company does not listen in on such conversations. Under the circumstances, the complaint should be dismissed since the defendant\u2019s guilt was not proved beyond a reasonable doubt.\u201d</p>\n<p id=\"b213-5\">Even more incredible, perhaps, is complainants\u2019 testimony that defendant, whom they identified as the theretofore unknown caller by his voice, suddenly appeared, upon his own volition, at the car service\u2019s office and offered to pay $300 for the \"damages\u201d he had caused as a result of the telephone calls. According to complainants, defendant explained that he had made the calls because he had had \"nothing else to do\u201d.</p>\n<p id=\"b213-6\">This court has for a long time and still does review a record in a criminal action as a whole and is empowered and obliged to conclude on a deficient record that guilt has not been established beyond a reasonable doubt as a matter of law (see, e.g., <em>People v Sickles, </em>35 NY2d 792, 793; <em>People v Logue, </em>35 NY2d 658, 659; <em>People v Collins, </em>31 NY2d 878, 879; <em>People v Oyola, </em>6 NY2d 259, 261; <em>People v Wrieden, </em>299 NY 425, 428; <em>People v Bearden, </em>290 NY 478, 479-480; <em>People v Gluck, </em>188 <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"176\">*176</page-number>NY 167, 171-172; <em>People v Ledwon, </em>153 NY 10, 17-18; see, also, <em>People v Whitmore, </em>28 NY2d 826, 832-833 [dissenting opn]; see, generally, Cohen and Karger, Powers of the New York Court of Appeals, \u00a7 198, at pp 742-743).</p>\n<p id=\"b214-5\">Given the bizarre nature of the People\u2019s proof, more than a formal issue of credibility of witnesses is involved. The clearest judgment one can make about the record in this case is that it does not reveal what actually happened, in some undisclosed context, between or among these small-time, part-time, street-smart, and street-tough \"gypsy-taxicab\u201d rivals. The record in this case is not of the stuff that warrants a criminal conviction, and more than a merely mechanical categorization between law and facts is merited if this court is to perform its great function of review.</p>\n<p id=\"b214-6\">When the proof is so thin that it will not support a featherweight, although dressed in \"prima facie\u201d semblance, the facts to be proved are impossible because they are impossible of belief. This is such a case.</p>\n<p id=\"b214-7\">Accordingly, the order of the Appellate Term should be reversed and the complaint dismissed.</p>\n</opinion>\n<opinion data-order=\"8\" data-type=\"opinion\" id=\"x999-2\" type=\"dissent\">\n<author id=\"b214-8\">Wachtler, J.</author>\n<p id=\"AvZ\">(dissenting). The order of the Appellate Term should be affirmed.</p>\n<p id=\"b214-9\">The People\u2019s evidence disclosed that Always Available Car Service had received what was estimated as 2,500 to 3,000 obscene telephone calls over a six-month period. The c\u00e1ller was identified as male and the calls opened with several \"meows\u201d. One morning the caller stated that he wanted to pay for the damage he had caused, offered to come to the garage for that purpose, and was encouraged to do so. Thereafter appellant appeared and when he spoke the telephone dispatcher recognized his voice as that of the caller. Appellant then admitted making the calls and offered to pay $300 as damages for the obscene remarks he had made over the telephone, adding that he had made the calls just for fun. There was further evidence that one of the obscene calls had been traced to a telephone located at appellant\u2019s place of employment to which he and others had access.</p>\n<p id=\"b214-10\">For his part appellant denied making the calls. He then related that one night while he was working the midnight to eight shift three men beat and robbed him. One of his assailants told appellant that if he wanted to know what it was all about he should contact the automobile service agency. Appellant\u2019s version was that he then went to the garage, and was <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"177\">*177</page-number>accused of working for a competitor. Later appellant made a criminal complaint against two of the employees of Always Available Car Service.</p>\n<p id=\"b215-4\">After summations on each side, which stressed the issue of credibility, and charges to which neither side raised objection, the jury returned a verdict of guilty of the crime of aggravated harassment under section 240.30 of the Penal Law.</p>\n<p id=\"b215-5\">Viewing the evidence in the light most favorable to the People, as we must on this appeal, I conclude that there was sufficient evidence to establish appellant\u2019s guilt of the crime charged beyond a reasonable doubt. The issues of credibility of the People\u2019s witnesses and of the weight to be attached to their testimony, while troublesome, were properly left to the jury under instructions to which appellant took no exception.</p>\n<p id=\"b215-6\">As the majority aptly notes, the nature of the People\u2019s proof was indeed bizarre. But in my view that alone is not a valid basis for reversing the conviction in this, or any other, case. Were this court empowered to review the facts, weigh the evidence, or substitute its judgment for that of the jury, I would be in full agreement with the majority opinion. However, the Court of Appeals, within its limited scope of review, is not given these powers. As we recently noted in <em>People v Scheck </em>(36 NY2d 918, 919): \"Although the incident upon which this conviction is based seems bizarre, the matter is now beyond the fact-finding stage and the existence of evidence establishing the elements of the offense compels us to affirm.\u201d Jurisprudentially, I would consider the approach we took in the <em>Scheck </em>case to be far more sound than approaching each case on an <em>ad hoc </em>basis.</p>\n<p id=\"b215-7\">Chief Judge Breitel and Judges Jasen, Jones and Fuchs-berg concur in <em>Per Curiam </em>opinion; Judge Wachtler dissents and votes to affirm in a separate opinion in which Judges Gabrielli and Cooke concur.</p>\n<p id=\"b215-8\">Order reversed, etc.</p>\n</opinion>\n</casebody>\n",
