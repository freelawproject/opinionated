Plaintiff town has standing to contest illegal actions of the trustees of a village within its borders where such actions will cause extensive ecological and other damages to the complaining town. <em>(United States v SCRAP, </em>412 US 669; <em>Matter of Smithtown v Howell, </em>31 NY2d 365; <em>Matter of Golden v Planning Bd. of Town of Ramapo, </em>30 NY2d 359; <em>Matter of Pearson Kent Corp. v Bear, </em>28 NY2d 396; <em>Matter of Nattin Realty v Ludewig, </em>40 AD2d 535, 32 NY2d 681; <em>Matter of Fulling v Palumbo, </em>21 NY2d 30; <em>Matter of Walsh v Spadaccia, </em>73 Misc 2d 866; <em>Bloom v Town Bd. of Town of Oyster Bay, </em>41 AD2d 533; <em>Township of Riv.

Plaintiff town has standing to challenge <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"336\">*336</page-number>corruption and/or conflict of interest within its borders and such conduct cannot be shielded from judicial scrutiny by labeling it \"legislative motive\u201d. <em>(Matter of Sanders v Davidson, </em>258 App Div 1058, 284 NY 780; <em>Matter of Sarber Realty Corp. v Silver, </em>25 Misc 2d 261; <em>Gellis v Clark, </em>32 Misc 2d 597; <em>Matter of Taub v Pirnie, </em>3 NY2d 188; <em>Smith v Morgan, </em>167 Misc 815, 254 App Div 672, 278 NY 667.) III. Village Law (\u00a7 7-706) constitutes no bar to the present action, since plaintiff town does not seek review of any zoning determination, but instead contends that there is no valid zoning law in effect. <em>Matter of Town of Bedford v Village of Mount Kisco, </em>40 AD2d 979, 33 NY2d 178; <em>Matter of Town of Smithtown v Howell, </em>31 NY2d 365; <em>Matter of Golden v Planning Bd. of Town of Ramapo, </em>30 NY2d 359; <em>Matter of City of Glen Cove v Buxenbaum, </em>17 AD2d 828.) IV. Plaintiff town was effectively denied its right to be heard, pursuant to the terms of Village Law (\u00a7 7-706), when its request for a reasonable period of time to submit additional data was denied. V. The Zoning Ordinance of North Hills, on its face, violates the terms of Village Law (\u00a7 7-738), was not adopted pursuant to a comprehensive plan, and is detrimental to public health, welfare and safety. <em>(Van Deusen v Jackson, </em>35 AD2d 58, 28 NY2d 608.)</p>\n<attorneys data-order=\"5\" data-type=\"attorneys\" id=\"b374-5\"><em>John P.

Village Law (\u00a7 7-706) deprives plaintiff Town of North Hempstead of standing to sue. <em>(Matter of Town of Bedford v Village of Mount Kisco, </em>33 NY2d 178; <em>People v Scott, </em>26 NY2d 286; <em>Matter of Perry v Town of Cherry Val., </em>307 NY 427; <em>Matter of Bon-Air Estates v Building Inspector of Town of Ramapo, </em>31 AD2d 502; <em>Wells v Town of Salina, </em>119 NY 280; <em>Incorporated Vil. of Brookville v Paulgene Realty Corp., </em>24 Misc 2d 790, 14 AD2d 575, 11 NY2d 672; <em>People ex rel.

Co., </em>293 NY 379; <em>Milner Co. v Noudar, Lda., </em>24 AD2d 326.) III. Appellant town relies upon the trend toward environmental impact statements. <em>(Matter of Golden v Planning Bd. of Town of Ramapo, </em>30 NY2d 359; <em>Matter of Smithtown v Howell, </em>31 NY2d 365; <em>Matter of Pearson Kent Corp. v Bear, </em>28 NY2d 396; <em>Matter of Nattin Realty v Ludewig, </em>40 AD2d 535; <em>Matter of Fulling v Palumbo, </em>21 NY2d 30; <em>Rodgers v Village of Tarrytown, </em>302 NY 115; <em>Matter of Douglaston Civic Assn. v Galvin, </em>36 NY2d 1.)</p>\n<attorneys data-order=\"9\" data-type=\"attorneys\" id=\"b375-5\"><em>Donald A.

The Town of North Hempstead has no standing to sue under statutory procedure provided by Village Law (\u00a7 7-706) and the application in fact of this procedure in the instant case. <em>(Rose v Himely, </em>4 Cranch [8 US] 241.) II. The town\u2019s assertion that the Ordinance of the Village of North Hills is invalid flies in the face of fundamental principles governing the powers and jurisdiction of municipalities. <em>(City of New Rochelle v State of New York, </em>34 Misc 2d 454; <em>Springfield Fire &amp; Mar.

III. The Village of North Hills has jurisdiction and, therefore exclusive discretion, in planning and zoning determinations within its territorial boundaries. IV. The Town of North Hempstead\u2019s assertion of a conflict of interest by the Board of Trustees of the Village of North Hills in enacting the zoning amendment does not fall within the criteria of conflict of interest in an application for zone change as defined by the State Legislature in General Municipal Law (\u00a7 809).</p>\n<attorneys data-order=\"11\" data-type=\"attorneys\" id=\"b376-5\"><em>Patrick J.

That part of the zoning ordinance authorizing the R-CL cluster residence district as a floating zone is exclusionary and unconstitutionally discriminatory. <em>(Rodgers v Village of Tarry-town, </em>302 NY 115; <em>Thomas v Town of Bedford, </em>11 NY2d 428; <em>Tata v Town of Babylon, 52 </em>Misc 2d 667; <em>Rogers v North Amer.

Conflict of interest on the part of public officials raises a constitutional issue, where the same results in direct damage to individual citizens. <em>(Meinhard v Salmon, </em>249 NY 458; <em>Matter of Sanders v Davidson, 258 </em>App Div 1058, 284 NY 780; <em>Matter of Sarber Realty Corp. v Silver, 25 </em>Misc 2d 261; <em>Matter of Gellis v Clark, </em>32 Misc 2d 597; <em>Matter of Taub v Pirnie, </em>3 NY2d 188; <em>Turney v Ohio, </em>273 US 510; <em>Matter of Smith v Morgan, </em>167 Misc 815, 254 App Div 672, 278 NY 667.) III. Intervenor-respondents failed to comply with the mandatory standards in the zoning ordinance imposed by the board as conditions for rezoning under section 4.5 of the Zoning Ordinance. <em>(Matter of Off Shore Rest.

IV. The board\u2019s action in approving the change of zone was arbitrary and capricious.</p>\n<attorneys data-order=\"13\" data-type=\"attorneys\" id=\"b377-3\"><page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"339\">*339</page-number><em>John P.

R-CL cluster provision is neither exclusionary nor unconstitutionally discriminatory. II.

Section 4.5 of the North Hills Zoning Ordinance is compatible with the comprehensive plan. <em>(Rodgers v Village of Tarrytown, </em>302 NY 115; <em>Thomas v Town of Bedford, </em>11 NY2d 428; <em>Udell v Haas, </em>21 NY2d 463; <em>Nappi v La Guardia, </em>184 Misc 775, 269 App Div 693, 295 NY 652; <em>Rogers v North Amer.

Limitation of the R-CL district to parcels of four or more acres is not unconstitutionally discriminatory. <em>(Rodgers v Village of Tarry-town, </em>302 NY 115.) III. There was no conflict of interest in the enactment of section 4.5 of the ordinance. IV. The grant of the Gut application was not impaired by procedural defects. <em>(Matter of Bar Harbour Shopping Center v Andrews, </em>23 Misc 2d 894; <em>Matter of Sun Oil Co. v Young, </em>37 AD2d 969; <em>Matter of Lemir Realty Corp. v Larkin, </em>11 NY2d 20.) V. The board\u2019s action in approving the change of zone was neither arbitrary nor capricious. <em>(Matter of Wilcox v Zoning Bd. of Appeals of City of Yonkers, </em>17 NY2d 249.)</p>\n<opinion data-order=\"17\" data-type=\"opinion\" id=\"x999-1\" type=\"majority\">\n<author id=\"b377-5\">Jasen, J.</author>\n<p id=\"ALM\">In the first of these consolidated appeals <em>(Town of North Hempstead v Village of North Hills), </em>the Town of North Hempstead seeks a judgment declaring a zoning ordinance and amendment adopted by the Village of North Hills to be unconstitutional, and enjoining village officials from authorizing or permitting construction on any parcel of land benefited by the challenged ordinance and amendment. Special Term granted the village\u2019s motion to dismiss the com<page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"340\">*340</page-number>plaint on the ground that the town lacks standing to commence such an action. In the second appeal <em>(Matter of Ruggiero v Grace), </em>certain individual property owners seek a judgment pursuant to CPLR article 78 annulling the determination made by the board of trustees of the village in rezoning a particular parcel under this same ordinance, and declaring a portion of the ordinance to be unconstitutional. Special Term also dismissed this petition on the ground that the individual property owners lack standing, but at the same time indicated that even if they had standing, the petition would be dismissed on the merits. On consolidated appeals, the Appellate Division affirmed both judgments, but indicated that it did not approve of the conclusion that the property owners in <em>Matter of Ruggiero </em>had no standing. We would affirm that order affirming both judgments.</p>\n<p id=\"b378-5\">We agree with the conclusion reached in the courts below in <em>Town of North Hempstead </em>that the town lacks standing to challenge this ordinance and amendment. Subdivision 1 of section 7-706 of the Village Law provides in relevant part that \"written notice of any proposed [zoning] change or amendment affecting property within five hundred feet of the boundaries of any * * * town * * * shall be given * * * to the clerk of such * * * town * * * at least ten days prior to the date of such public hearing. Such * * * town * * * shall have the right to appear and to be heard at such public hearing with respect to any such proposed change or amendment, but shall not have the right of review by a court as hereinafter provided.\u201d<footnotemark>1</footnotemark> The town does not contend that the village failed to give it the required notice either in 1970 when the challenged ordinance was originally adopted or in 1974 when certain property was rezoned pursuant to the terms of that ordinance. Since we can assume, therefore, that the village fulfilled the requirements of section 7-706, we hold that the town is prohibited from seeking judicial review by the express terms of the statute.</p>\n<p id=\"b378-6\">The town would instead have us ignore the unequivocal language of section 7-706 and grant it standing by extending the rationale of such cases as <em>United States v SCRAP </em>(412 US 669), <em>Sierra Club v Morton </em>(405 US 727), and <em>Matter of Douglaston Civic Assn. v Galvin </em>(36 NY2d 1), which broadened <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"341\">*341</page-number>standing in at least environmental<footnotemark>2</footnotemark> and zoning matters. Significantly, however, those and similar cases did not involve a statutory denial of standing, and that distinction is fatal to the town\u2019s claim.<footnotemark>3</footnotemark></p>\n<p id=\"b379-4\">Nor does <em>Matter of Town of Bedford v Village of Mount Kisco </em>(33 NY2d 178, 185) lend any support to the town\u2019s argument. In that case, section 452 of the Westchester County Administrative Code contained a \"specific statutory grant of standing to challenge an adjacent municipality\u2019s zoning actions\u201d. Here, however, there is no such code or charter provision that would make the denial of standing in section 7-706 inapplicable to zoning matters in Nassau County. Likewise, <em>Township of Riv. Vale v Town of Orangetown </em>(403 F2d 684) does not bolster the town\u2019s argument. That case involved a challenge in Federal court by a New Jersey township to a zoning change in an area of a New York town contiguous to the New Jersey township\u2019s border. In such a situation, section 264 of the Town Law (the counterpart of Village Law, \u00a7 7-706, subd 1) obviously would not prevent a township in another State from attacking in Federal court a New York town\u2019s zoning change.</p>\n<p id=\"b379-5\">We have recently said that \"in enacting a zoning ordinance, consideration must be given to regional needs and requirements\u201d because \"zoning often has a substantial impact beyond the boundaries of the municipality.\u201d <em>(Berenson v Town of New Castle, </em>38 NY2d 102, 110.) Rather than burden the courts with the tasks of a regional planner, we invited the Legislature (p 111) to \"make appropriate changes in order to foster the development of programs designed to achieve sound regional planning.\u201d Our refusal today to grant the Town of North Hempstead standing, since it is based upon a specific statutory denial, is not inconsistent with the view we expressed in <em>Berenson.</em></p>\n<p id=\"b379-6\">Although we must therefore dispose of <em>Town of Nort. Hempstead </em>on the standing issue, no such bar in <em>Matter o\u00ed </em><page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"342\">*342</page-number><em>Ruggiero </em>prevents us from reaching the merits of this controversy.<footnotemark>4</footnotemark> Following a two-year study and review of the existing zoning in the village, and after three public hearings, the Board of Trustees of the Village of North Hills in 1970 enacted a revised Building Zone Ordinance. Among the districts established by the ordinance was a \"Cluster Residence, R-CL District\u201d. This was a \"floating zone\u201d whose boundaries were not fixed in the original ordinance, but were to be established by later amendments to the zoning map. Any property in the R-2 district (in which single-family detached dwellings on plots of at least two acres were permitted) could potentially be rezoned t\u00f3 R-CL if certain requirements were met. Among those requirements were a minimum plot size of four acres. Permitted uses were limited to single-family dwellings in detached, semi-attached or attached (townhouse) structures, with overall density limited to four families per acre.<footnotemark>5</footnotemark> Following a public hearing, an application made by the intervenor-respondent Gut was approved by the board in 1974, making the Gut parcel the first to be rezoned R-CL. Thereafter, the petitioners, owners of properties which abut or are <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"343\">*343</page-number>located near the Gut parcel, commenced this article 78 proceeding.</p>\n<p id=\"b381-4\">The principal contention is that the part of the zoning ordinance authorizing the R-CL district as a floating zone is exclusionary and unconstitutionally discriminatory. The basis for this claim is that petitioner Ruggiero and other property owners whose parcels do not meet the four-acre requirement are frozen into the R-2 district, whereas owners of larger parcels may apply for the R-CL classification.</p>\n<p id=\"b381-5\">We first approved the use of floating zones in <em>Rodgers v Village of Tarrytown </em>(302 NY 115, 122-123). In that case this court dismissed a similar argument with the following statement: \"As to the requirement that the applicant own a plot of at least ten acres, we find nothing therein unfair to plaintiff or other owners of smaller parcels.' The board undoubtedly found, as it was privileged to find, that garden apartments would blend more attractively and harmoniously with the community setting, would impose less of a burden upon village facilities, if placed upon larger tracts of land rather than scattered about in smaller units. Obviously, some definite acreage had to be chosen, and, so far as the record before us reveals, the choice of ten acres as a minimum plot was well within the range of an unassailable legislative judgment.\u201d We have no difficulty in this case with the four-acre requirement established by the village. Certainly this makes the R-CL classification potentially available to a larger class of property owners than would, for example, the 10-acre minimum approved in <em>Rodgers. </em>Indeed, petitioners\u2019 claim that the R-CL classification is unavailable to only seven owners of property presently zoned R-2 serves only to bolster the contrary view that the ordinance is neither impermissibly exclusionary nor unconstitutionally discriminatory.</p>\n<p id=\"b381-6\">Petitioners make one further attempt to distinguish <em>Rodgers. </em>They point out that in <em>Rodgers </em>any area in the village might make application to be included in the floating zone (provided, of course, the other requirements were met), whereas in this case, the R-CL classification may be applied only to parcels presently zoned R-2. We find that distinction to be of no significance here, especially since it appears that 80% of the land in the Village of North Hills presently is in the R-2 zone.</p>\n<p id=\"b381-7\">We also reject the claim that the challenged amendment was not \"in accordance with a comprehensive plan\u201d as re<page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"344\">*344</page-number>quired by section 7-704 of the Village Law. Nothing in the record suggests that there has been anything here other than \"comprehensiveness of planning, rather than special interest, irrational <em>ad hocery. \u201d (Matter of Town of Bedford v Village of Mount Kisco, </em>33 NY2d 178, 188, <em>supra.)</em></p>\n<p id=\"b382-5\">Nor do we find any merit to petitioners\u2019 contention that the individual members of the board acted in an apparent conflict of interest in approving the ordinance and the amendment. None of the members owns any interest in the Gut parcel which was reclassified. Rather, the basis for this claim is that several of the members own parcels of real estate which meet the four-acre requirement and might, therefore, be reclassified R-CL at some future date. This claim is at best speculative. Petitioners do not argue that there has been a lack of compliance with section 809 of the General Municipal Law which sets out the applicable rules for disclosure in conflict of interest situations. Since it appears that most of the real property in the village meets the acreage requirements for reclassification, petitioners\u2019 argument would make all but a handful of property owners in the village ineligible to sit on the board in such matters.<footnotemark>6</footnotemark></p>\n<p id=\"b382-6\">For the foregoing reasons, the order of the Appellate Division should be affirmed in all respects.</p>\n<p id=\"b382-7\">Chief Judge Breitel and Judges Gabrielli, Jones, Fuchs-berg and Cooke concur; Judge Wachtler taking no part.</p>\n<p id=\"b382-8\">In each case: Order affirmed, with costs.</p>\n<footnote label=\"1\">\n<p id=\"b378-7\">. We reject the town\u2019s argument, that the consequence of the final words of the subdivision, \"as hereinafter provided\u201d, should be to limit the prohibition of judicial review only in an article 78 proceeding, as hypertechnical and unduly restrictive.</p>\n</footnote>\n<footnote label=\"2\">\n<p id=\"b379-7\">. The town claims that the zoning ordinance and amendment will cause it extensive ecological damage.</p>\n</footnote>\n<footnote label=\"3\">\n<p id=\"b379-8\">. We note that there is no consensus in the courts of other States as to whether municipalities have standing to challenge zoning of land lying outside its borders where there is no statute specifically governing standing. (See Standing of Municipal Corporation or Other Governmental Body to Attack Zoning of Land Lying Outside Its Borders, Ann., 49 ALR3d 1126.) Since that issue is not before us, we express no opinion as to whether the town would have standing in the absence of section 7-706.</p>\n</footnote>\n<footnote label=\"4\">\n<p id=\"b380-5\">. Although the trial court denied standing in <em>Matter of Ruggiero, </em>the Appellate Division disapproved of that much of the determination. Since the standing issue was not, raised in this appeal, we do not express an opinion in that regard.</p>\n</footnote>\n<footnote label=\"5\">\n<p id=\"b380-6\">.
