That witness made out and caused to be presented to defendants, a bill of freight, for the goods specified in the bill of particulars ; that this bill was included in a bill <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"662\">*662</page-number>for other goods received for the defendants by the same vessel. That the bills of freight were presented by their collector, Mr. Turneure, and that witness understood from Mr. Turneure, that the defendants had requested that a separate bill for these goods might be made out, and presented to Mainon &amp; Bonnay.. That witness did accordingly make out the bills separately, and gave them to the clerk to collect. That he does not recollect any particular conversation with Mr. Merian respecting the bill; that it was a very usual thing for witness to separate the bills upon the request of parties, and collect freight from others ; and that it was done more frequently for Merian &amp; Benard, than any other house in New-York.</summary>\n<summary data-order=\"45\" data-type=\"summary\" id=\"b678-4\">The counsel for the plaintiffs next produced as a witness,\u2014 <em>William </em>Turneure, who, being sworn, testified that he is a clerk of Boyd &amp; Hincken, and collects their freight bills; that defendants received other goods by the same ship. One bill was made out against defendants for the freight of all the goods consigned to defendants in the ship, and witness called on defendants and left the bill. On calling the second time, witness was requested by Mr. Merian to make out a separate bill for the goods included in the bill of particulars of plaintiffs against Mainon &amp; Bonnay.

To a question by a juror, Had Mainon &amp; Bonnay stopped payment when you presented them the bill 7 Witness answered \u201che did not know.\u201d</summary>\n<summary data-order=\"72\" data-type=\"summary\" id=\"b680-4\"><page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"664\">*664</page-number>The said plaintiffs thereupon rested. Whereupon, the counsel for the defendants opened his defence to the jury, and Called as a witness\u2014</summary>\n<summary data-order=\"73\" data-type=\"summary\" id=\"b680-5\">Pierre Bonnay, who, being sworn, testified that the goods, referred to in the bill of particulars, were ordered and purchased by deponent\u2019s firm, Mainon &amp; Bonnay, from a house in France; that the defendants had no interest whatever in them; that they were forwarded to witness\u2019 house through the defendants, in order that witness might settle the payment of the price of the goods ; that this was the course which had always been adopted with respect to witness\u2019 goods coming through the hands of the defendants, and also through Mr. Boisgerard, one of the. plaintiffs; that the invoice of the goods was always made out to Mainon &amp; Bonnay, and the bill of lading was sent to the defendants or Mr. Boisgerard, to be transferred to the witness, upon a settlement for the price of the goods; that these goods were, as in the case of all others, entered, and the duties paid by witness ; that witness has in all cases received from Boyd &amp; Hincken, as agents for the Havre packets, the bills of freight for goods forwarded through the defendants, which he has paid, until these bills; that he promised to pay these bills when presented, but was unable to do so. Witness further testified, that a great portion of the goods specified in the bill of particulars, being then a part of the stock in witness\u2019 store, were included in a general assignment of all the property, executed by Mainon &amp; Bonnay, in July, 1840, to the defendants, for the benefit of creditors; that the defendants were the heaviest creditors.</summary>\n<summary data-order=\"74\" data-type=\"summary\" id=\"b680-6\">The counsel for the defendants here rested.</summary>\n<summary data-order=\"75\" data-type=\"summary\" id=\"b680-7\">His honor, the presiding judge, then charged the jury, that this case turned upon questions of law, involving the points of the liability of the defendants for the freight of these goods, and the discharge of them from such liability, if any had ever existed. That these questions would be reserved for ulterior consideration; but that, for the purposes of this trial, he should charge the jury that the defendants were liable for the freight, -unless the jury should find that an express contract was entered <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"665\">*665</page-number>into by the plaintiffs to look to Mainon &amp; Bonnay for the same, and to absolve the defendants from the obligation in the premises; and with this charge, submitted the cause to the jury.</summary>\n<summary data-order=\"76\" data-type=\"summary\" id=\"b681-5\">To this charge, the counsel for the defendants excepted, and the court noted the exception.</summary>\n<summary data-order=\"77\" data-type=\"summary\" id=\"b681-6\">Under this charge, the jury immediately rendered a verdict for the plaintiffs, for three hundred and forty-nine dollars and sixteen cents.</summary>\n<summary data-order=\"78\" data-type=\"summary\" id=\"b681-7\">The superior court, at general term, in May, 1843, overruled the bill of exceptions, and denied a new trial. The defendants brought a writ of error, and removed the judgment to the supreme court. And at the January term, 1847, that court reversed the judgment of the superior court, and awarded a new trial. (4 Demo, 110.) The plaintiffs thereupon brought error, and removed the judgment of the supreme court into the court of errors; and the proceedings were subsequently transferred ,to this court.</summary>\n<summary data-order=\"79\" data-type=\"summary\" id=\"b681-8\">The cause was submitted to the court upon printed points and arguments.</summary>\n<attorneys data-order=\"80\" data-type=\"attorneys\" id=\"b681-9\"><em>M. R. Zabriskie, attorney and counsel </em>for plaintiffs in error.</attorneys>\n<p data-order=\"81\" data-type=\"legal\" id=\"b681-10\"><em>First. </em>The consignee is the natural person to whom to look for payment of freight. And when goods have been delivered to him in accordance with the bill of lading, or the known custom of the port, he is liable. <em>(Kent\u2019s Com., vol. </em>3, <em>p. </em>222, <em>5th ed. ; Abbot on Shipping, p. </em>414, <em>Lon. ed. of </em>1844; <em>Sanders </em>v. <em>Vanzeller, </em>4 <em>Queen's Bench Rep., p. </em>260.)</p>\n<p data-order=\"82\" data-type=\"legal\" id=\"b681-11\">In this case, the goods were delivered into public store on general order to discharge the ship. Such order was compulsory upon the plaintiffs, and delivery under it to the government, after the bill for the freight had been* rendered, and without notice that defendants were not responsible for the freight, was <em>a delivery to defendants. (Laws of U. S. </em>1799, <em>ch. </em>128, \u00a7\u00a7 23, 25, 36, 49, 53, 56, 62.)</p>\n<p data-order=\"83\" data-type=\"legal\" id=\"b681-12\"><em>Second. </em>The bills of lading were not endorsed over by de<page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"666\">*666</page-number>fendants, until after a part of the goods had been for several months in the public warehouses. During all this time the defendants were the owners of the goods, and as such bound to pay the freight.</p>\n<p data-order=\"84\" data-type=\"legal\" id=\"b682-4\">They can only be discharged from the payment by showing:</p>\n<p data-order=\"85\" data-type=\"legal\" id=\"b682-5\">1. That they refused to receive the goods, and gave notice of such refusal to the plaintiffs.</p>\n<p data-order=\"86\" data-type=\"legal\" id=\"b682-6\">2. That an express contract was entered into, to discharge the defendants from their liability.</p>\n<p data-order=\"87\" data-type=\"legal\" id=\"b682-7\">In the United States, the master cannot enter goods in his own name, and thus preserve his lien for freight. <em>(Harris </em>v. <em>Dennie, </em>3 Peters, 298.)</p>\n<p data-order=\"88\" data-type=\"legal\" id=\"b682-8\">On the 24th of September, 1839, the plaintiffs received on board the packet ship Baltimore, in the port of Havre de Grace, in France, nine bales, containing willow baskets, for which the master signed the usual printed bills of lading, <em>(pp. </em>10 <em>and </em>11 <em>of the case,) </em>filled in with the names of the defendants as the consignees.</p>\n<p data-order=\"89\" data-type=\"legal\" id=\"b682-9\">The nine bales arrived in due course, and soon after, Mr. Turneure, the collecting clerk of Messrs. Boyd &amp; Hincken, the agents of the ship, called on the defendants to collect the bill for the freight. This bill contained charges for freight of other goods consigned to defendants by the same vessel. Instead of paying it, they requested the clerk to separate the bills ; that is, to make out separate bills against different parties, for various portions of the articles consigned to defendants\u2014a very customary thing, it appears, to be done in such cases, and \u201c done more frequently for the defendants than for any other house in New-York.\u201d <em>(Page </em>12.)</p>\n<p data-order=\"90\" data-type=\"legal\" id=\"b682-10\">A bill for the nine bales of baskets was accordingly made out against Mainon &amp; Bonnay.</p>\n<p data-order=\"91\" data-type=\"legal\" id=\"b682-11\">It does not appear that any request was made to plaintiffs, to collect the amount of the bill from Mainon &amp; Bonnay; nor does it appear that the bill, or a copy of it, was left with defendants that they might collect it. They, however, on the 22d November, 1839, (p. 14,) paid for the freight of so much <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"667\">*667</page-number>of the goods consigned to them, as was not included in bills which they had asked to have made out against others.</p>\n<p data-order=\"92\" data-type=\"legal\" id=\"b683-5\">On the 15th of January, 1840, plaintiffs received on board the same ship, at the same port, ten other bales of willow baskets, shipped by the same person in Havre, and consigned to the defendants. <em>(Bill of Lading, p. </em>11.)</p>\n<p data-order=\"93\" data-type=\"legal\" id=\"b683-6\">The same circumstances occurred with regard to this consignment. Plaintiffs presented their bill. Defendants asked to have it separated, (into how many does not appear,) and that a bill for these ten bales might be made out against Mai-non &amp; Bonnay. It was done. On the 3d April, 1840, defendants paid plaintiffs $107.90, \u201c for freight per Baltimore, from Havre.\u201d The receipt was not \u201cin full.\u201d</p>\n<p data-order=\"94\" data-type=\"legal\" id=\"b683-7\">The bills against Mainon &amp; Bonnay, as a matter of politeness to defendants, were presented to them, and they promised to pay them; but afterwards refused to do so : and when the clerk presented the bills again to the defendants, they refused to pay them, and set up that they were not the owners of the goods, and were therefore not responsible for the freight.</p>\n<p data-order=\"95\" data-type=\"legal\" id=\"b683-8\">The goods belonged to the manufacturers, in France. <em>(Bonnafs testimony, p. </em>14.)</p>\n<p data-order=\"96\" data-type=\"legal\" id=\"b683-9\">The first lot was sold by defendants, as the manufacturers\u2019 agents, to Mainon &amp; Bonnay, on the 22d February, 1840, as appears by the endorsement on the bill of lading, <em>(p. </em>11,) five months after the time of shipment.</p>\n<p data-order=\"97\" data-type=\"legal\" id=\"b683-10\">The endorsement of the bill of lading of the second lot has no date.</p>\n<p data-order=\"98\" data-type=\"legal\" id=\"b683-11\">Until the endorsements of the bills of lading, the title of the goods was in defendants.</p>\n<p data-order=\"99\" data-type=\"legal\" id=\"b683-12\">As naked consignees, they were primarily liable to pay the freight. <em>(Kent\u2019s Com., vol. </em>3, <em>p. </em>222, <em>5th ed.) </em>'</p>\n<p data-order=\"100\" data-type=\"legal\" id=\"b683-13\">Mainon &amp; Bonnay, as purchasers from them, were not liable. <em>(Artaza </em>v. <em>Smallpiece, </em>1 <em>Esp. </em>N. <em>P. C. </em>23 ; <em>cited and approved by Kent.</em>)</p>\n<p data-order=\"101\" data-type=\"legal\" id=\"b683-14\">The goods were carried and delivered on the credit of the defendants; they, having given no notice that the plaintiffs <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"668\">*668</page-number>must look to their lien for the freight, by construction of law received them, and are liable on this ground.</p>\n<p data-order=\"102\" data-type=\"legal\" id=\"b684-5\">They also received them, in fact, (a great part, if not the whole of them,) in July, 1840. <em>(Bonnay\u2019s testimony, p. </em>15.)</p>\n<p data-order=\"103\" data-type=\"legal\" id=\"b684-6\">This suit was not begun until November, 1841.</p>\n<attorneys data-order=\"104\" data-type=\"attorneys\" id=\"b684-7\"><em>F.

R. </em>184.)</p>\n<p data-order=\"106\" data-type=\"legal\" id=\"b684-9\"><em>Second. </em>Where a consignee endorses a bill of lading, the \u25a0assignee becomes the appointee of the original shipper, to receive the goods; and if the goods be received by him, he is the only party liable for the freight. <em>(Tobin </em>v. <em>Crawford, </em>5 <em>Mees. </em>&amp; Wels. 235 ; <em>same case affirmed in Exch. Chamber, </em>9 <em>Mees, </em>&amp; <em>Weis. </em>716.)</p>\n<p data-order=\"107\" data-type=\"legal\" id=\"b684-10\">The charge of the judge, therefore, that the defendants in error were liable as consignees, notwithstanding they had endorsed over the bill of lading to parties who received the goods, is erroneous; and that decision was properly reversed by the supreme court.</p>\n<p data-order=\"108\" data-type=\"legal\" id=\"b684-11\">Argument.\u2014I shall only refer to sucn facts as have not been stated; or, as I conceive, have been.misapprehended by the opposite counsel.</p>\n<p data-order=\"109\" data-type=\"legal\" id=\"b684-12\">After the separation of the bills for freight, and the payment by the defendants of the freight on their own goods, it appears <em>(pp. </em>14 <em>and </em>15,) that those made out to Main\u00f3n &amp; Bonnay were <em>frequently </em>presented, payment promised, <em>never refused, </em>but postponed; and credit given until they finally failed.</p>\n<p data-order=\"110\" data-type=\"legal\" id=\"b684-13\">It does not appear that notice was ever given'to the defendants of any claim, until by this suit, after the lapse of two years, in November, 1841.</p>\n<p data-order=\"111\" data-type=\"legal\" id=\"b684-14\">The testimony of Bonnay <em>(p. </em>14,) shows that the property was always owned by, and at the risk of Mainon &amp; Bonnay ; <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"669\">*669</page-number>and that the defehdants had no interest in it; and the bills made out to the defendants, for freight on their own goods, <em>(p. </em>13,) and the receipts therefor, (p. 14,) and the course of the agent with respect to the bills for the freight now claimed, prove that he understood that Mainon &amp; Bonnay were the owners of the goods, and alone liable for freight.</p>\n<p data-order=\"112\" data-type=\"legal\" id=\"b685-5\">The counsel for the plaintiifs in error ^appears to concede the well established principle, that a receipt of the goods is necessary to fix a liability upon a consignee, for freight; but he contends that a deposite in the public store is equivalent to a delivery.</p>\n<p data-order=\"113\" data-type=\"legal\" id=\"b685-6\">Now, supposing this to be so, how would he overcome the effect of the fact, to which he has not adverted, and which appears from the admission, (p. 10,) that five bales of the last lot were delivered to Mainon &amp; Bonnay <em>from the ship. </em>That firm must already, under the act of congress, have made the entry as owners, covering the other five bales of the same lot subsequently sent to the public store.</p>\n<p data-order=\"114\" data-type=\"legal\" id=\"b685-7\">Here then was no delivery to the defendants, either actually or constructively, according to the argument of the counsel, if sound ; and still, the freight on these ten bales is included in the verdict; and the charge of the judge of which we complain was, that the defendants were liable for the whole freight.</p>\n<p data-order=\"115\" data-type=\"legal\" id=\"b685-8\">The law of the case, as I understand it, is this :</p>\n<p data-order=\"116\" data-type=\"legal\" id=\"b685-9\">On the shipment of goods under a bill of lading, the contract of the shipowner is with the shipper alone ; and it was originally held that this was the only party against whom recourse could be had.</p>\n<p data-order=\"117\" data-type=\"legal\" id=\"b685-10\">It was not until 1790, that it was held that the consignee could be in any case made responsible; and his liability was then put upon the express ground that, <em>by the receipt of the </em>goods, an implied promise to pay freight was raised, such payment being the condition upon which the goods were to be delivered.</p>\n<p data-order=\"118\" data-type=\"legal\" id=\"b685-11\">When the consignee endorses over the bill of lading, no privity arises between himself and the shipowner\u2014he subtitutes another appointee of .the shipper,'who has the same right to <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"670\">*670</page-number>receive the goods on the payment of freight; and whose receipt raises an implied promise on his own part to pay freight; and if the goods are delivered to, or received by the assignee of the bill of lading, without such payment, there is still no foundation for any obligation on the part of the consignee. His endorsement does not create the assignee his attorney or agent to receive the goods; it does not authorize a pledge of his credit for the freight, nor is he responsible on the naked endorsement, as in the case of promissory notes and bills of exchange.</p>\n<p data-order=\"119\" data-type=\"legal\" id=\"b686-4\">The cases of <em>Artaza </em>v. <em>Smallpiece, </em>and <em>The Theresa Bonita, </em>holding that the assignee is not responsible for freight, are expressly overruled in <em>Cock </em>v. <em>Taylor J </em>and the doctrine of the last case is fully supported in <em>Trask </em>v. <em>Duval. </em>Chancellor Kent, in his collection of authorities on questions of freight, states the decision of <em>Artaza </em>v. <em>Smallpiece, </em>but without comment or approval. The case of <em>Tobin </em>v. <em>Crawford </em>establishes that where the bill of lading has been endorsed, and the goods received by the assignee, the consignee is not responsible. These cases are on the points.</p>\n<p data-order=\"120\" data-type=\"legal\" id=\"b686-5\">In this case, the deposit of a portion of the goods in the public store, created no privity between the shipowner and the defendants ; it was not a delivery to them, it was not the act of consignees, nor does it destroy the lien of the master : for it was not <em>a voluntary delivery. </em>The act of congress was not intended to disturb the relations among parties in respect to ownership of, or liens upon property, but nakedly to secure the rights of the government.</p>\n<p data-order=\"121\" data-type=\"legal\" id=\"b686-6\">The storekeeper becomes the legal custodian of the property; he represents the interest of all parties. When the permit is given, that merely certifies that the duties are paid ; and should the master have interposed a notice of his lien for freight, we believe this could not have been- safely disregarded; an injunction would certainly have protected the ship-owner\u2019s rights.</p>\n<p data-order=\"122\" data-type=\"legal\" id=\"b686-7\">Whether or not, however, the act of congress takes away the lien of the master, it is sufficient for us to say, that it does not <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"671\">*671</page-number>make such deposit equivalent to a delivery to the consignee ; nor does it create any new liability not known to the common law on his part. In this case, the goods were actually received by others; there is therefore no foundation for a liability on the part of the consignees.</p>\n<p data-order=\"123\" data-type=\"legal\" id=\"b687-5\">Here, then, Mainon &amp; Bonnay received 'a portion of the goods from the ship, the balance from the public store, no measures being taken by the master to preserve his lien. They were the owners of the goods, they promised to pay the freight, they never refused, their course of business was well known tq Mr. Boisgerard, one of the plaintiffs ; finally they failed, and after two years, without previous notice, this claim is set up against the defendants, who had no interest, and had done no other act than nakedly to endorse a hill of lading, transferring the authority to Mainon &amp; Bonnay to receive the goods <em>on payment of freight.</em></p>\n<p data-order=\"124\" data-type=\"legal\" id=\"b687-6\">Reply.\u2014The defendant\u2019s counsel is mistaken, in supposing that any credit was given to Mainon &amp; Bonnay, by the plaintiffs.</p>\n<p data-order=\"125\" data-type=\"legal\" id=\"b687-7\">It does not appear affirmatively in the case; nor is it true, in fact; nor can it be fairly inferred from the circumstance of the plaintiffs presenting them with a bill. The bill was presented only at the defendants\u2019 request, and as a matter of politeness to them; and although Mainon &amp; Bonnay did promise to pay it, yet that did not raise an assumpsit on their part, being without consideration as between the plaintiffs and them; much less did it operate to release any responsibility on the part of the defendants.</p>\n<p data-order=\"126\" data-type=\"legal\" id=\"b687-8\">Nor can any inference, unfavorable to the plaintiffs, be made from the fact of this suit not. having been commenced until sixteen months (not two years, as stated by the counsel,) after Mainon &amp; Bonnay\u2019s failure, and the return of the goods by them to the defendants. On the contrary, if the counsel had inferred that, during all this time, the plaintiffs, by their agents, were reasoning with the defendants, and endeavoring to induce them by gentle means to pay the demand, he would.have been much nearer the truth.</p>\n<p data-order=\"127\" data-type=\"legal\" id=\"b688-3\"><page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"672\">*672</page-number>Again, I do not see how the counsel can infer from Bonnay\u2019s testimony, that he and his partner were the owners of the goods, when it directly appears that the goods \"were sent to the defendants as the agents of the manufacturer in France; to be held by them until they were paid for. <em>{Page </em>15.)</p>\n<p data-order=\"128\" data-type=\"legal\" id=\"b688-4\">To maintain, under such a state of facts, that the defendants were mere naked consignees without interest; and to endeavor to apply to them the principles of law, applying to mere naked consignees, seems to me, with due deference to the opinion of the court below, a proposition somewhat difficult to establish.</p>\n<p data-order=\"129\" data-type=\"legal\" id=\"b688-5\">But even granting, for the sake of the argument, that it was so ; granting that the goods had been shipped to them from Europe, without their knowledge, and by persons entirely unknown to them ; I still contend, that under the circumstances, they would have been liable, on the ground of their neglect to inform the plaintiffs of the true state of the case. It was a <em>suppressio veri, </em>and justified the plaintiffs in delivering the goods to another party, under the belief that the defendants would pay the freight.</p>\n<p data-order=\"130\" data-type=\"legal\" id=\"b688-6\">They were the consignees on the bill of lading, and, as such, the persons to whom the carrier was naturally to look for the freight. They were <em>prima-facie </em>responsible, and that responsibility could only he relieved by some action on their part; such as giving notice that they were not the owners of the goods, and did not consider themselves responsible.</p>\n<p data-order=\"131\" data-type=\"legal\" id=\"b688-7\">They knew perfectly well that Mainon &amp; Bonnay were persons of no standing and credit, and that the plaintiffs would not have delivered the goods, if they had known that they must look to them only for the freight.</p>\n<p data-order=\"132\" data-type=\"legal\" id=\"b688-8\">It was in the power of the defendants to have protected the plaintiffs, while the goods were yet in the ship, by disclosing the true state of the facts; they had repeated opportunities to do so, as regards both shipments, and it was their duty to have done <em>so; </em>as much so as it was their duty to protect their principal in France, by withholding the goods until they were paid for them.</p>\n<p data-order=\"133\" data-type=\"legal\" id=\"b688-9\">Having omitted to do so, if they really sold the goods to <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"673\">*673</page-number>Mainon &amp; Bonnay, without adding the freight to the price, (as is customary in such cases, and as they ought to have done ;) it is their misfortune, and should not be visited on the plaintiffs, who are free from all blame, and who only acted, in allowing the goods to go to the public store, in obedience to the law, and in accordance with the usage and the well known custom of the port.</p>\n<p data-order=\"134\" data-type=\"legal\" id=\"b689-5\">They certainly are innocent in the premises; they have-earned their money, and if this judgment goes against them, will be without redress. The defendants, on the other hand, may have already received the freight in the price of the goods when they sold them. There is nothing to contradict such an inference in the case. At all events, they probably protected themselves out of the goods when returned to them by Mainon &amp; Bonnay, under the general assignment made by them to the defendants.</p>\n<p data-order=\"135\" data-type=\"legal\" id=\"b689-6\">And if they are still losers, they have their remedy over, unless the loss was incurred by negligence on their part, against the manufacturer in France; a remedy which is entirely debarred to the plaintiffs, as they do not even know his name or place of residence. The defendants acted as his agents, and. were, no doubt, paid for their services. In the performance of their duties to him, they suffered the goods to go into public store, and to remain there (a part of them) for three months..</p>\n<p data-order=\"136\" data-type=\"attorneys\" id=\"b689-7\">During all this time, to whom did the goods belong <em>1</em></p>\n<p data-order=\"137\" data-type=\"legal\" id=\"b689-8\">Certainly not to Mainon &amp; Bonnay. If they had been destroyed by fire, the loss would not have fallen on them ; but on the manufacturer; and the defendants, as his agents, would have been culpably negligent if they had not kept them insured ; \"the goods were under their power and control; they had duties to perform in relation to them, to the government, and to others, as well as to their principal.</p>\n<p data-order=\"138\" data-type=\"legal\" id=\"b689-9\">If they have failed in any of those duties, they must pay the penalty. Their situation is similar to that of the drawee of a bill of exchange, to whom it has been presented for acceptance, and who refuses to accept or to return it.</p>\n<p data-order=\"139\" data-type=\"legal\" id=\"b690-3\"><page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"674\">*674</page-number>He makes himself liable even if the bill have been drawn on him without authority.</p>\n<p data-order=\"140\" data-type=\"legal\" id=\"b690-4\">In this case, the defendants\u2019 name was not used without their consent; and the bills of lading, one of them at least, was kept by them for more than three months, and then endorsed over. Both of them were regularly endorsed. Here was a recognition of the defendants\u2019 .agency, an acknowledgment, in writing, of their interest in the goods of such a nature as utterly does away with the idea of their being mere naked consignees.</p>\n<p data-order=\"141\" data-type=\"legal\" id=\"b690-5\">The counsel alludes to the admission, in the case, that five of the bales, in the last shipment, were delivered to Mainon &amp; Bonnay out of the ship ; and he says, that\" if this be so, then, under the act of congress, the whole of the last invoice must have been entered by Mainon &amp; Bonnay, as owners, previously to the delivery.</p>\n<p data-order=\"142\" data-type=\"legal\" id=\"b690-6\">But it is also admitted, that the other five bales of this shipment went into public store, \u201c <em>on general </em>order.\u201d <em>(Page </em>10.)</p>\n<p data-order=\"143\" data-type=\"legal\" id=\"b690-7\">Now, the only object in sending goods into the public store, is to protect the government in the collection of the duties; duties cannot be paid on a part of an invoice, and left unpaid on part. If a part went into public store, another part could not have been delivered to Mainon &amp; Bonnay. The admission in the case must, therefore, have been made in error.</p>\n<p data-order=\"144\" data-type=\"legal\" id=\"b690-8\">But, be this as it may\u2014</p>\n<p data-order=\"145\" data-type=\"legal\" id=\"b690-9\">The five bales, if delivered to Mainon &amp; Bonnay, were grot delivered by the plaintiffs, but by the government. The government, by its officers, takes charge of every cargo, and the master has no manner of control over the delivery. The course is for the collector, after the duties are paid, to send down his orders to his officer, having the custody of the cargo, to deliver it to the parties who have produced to the collector the proper evidences of title, and paid the duties. The order is called a permit. Such an order must have been produced to the inspector on board, by Mainon &amp; Bonnay, before he delivered to them the five bales, (if he did deliver them.)</p>\n<p data-order=\"146\" data-type=\"legal\" id=\"b690-10\">But even if the five bales were delivered, according to the argument of the opposite counsel, the plaintiffs still retained <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"675\">*675</page-number>their lien for the whole freight on the remaining five which went into public store. The defendants knew that they were taken there on the 26th of March, (jo. 10.) On the 3d April, following, <em>(p. </em>14,) they paid their bill for the freight of the other goods received by them on the voyage. Here was another chance for them to warn the plaintiffs to make an attempt, if they did not expect to pay it themselves, at least to secure them their money. But, as on the former occasions, nothing fell from them.</p>\n<p data-order=\"147\" data-type=\"legal\" id=\"b691-5\">Now, with regard to the cases; putting out of view <em>Artaza </em>v. <em>Smallpiece, </em>(1 <em>Esp. R. </em>23,) which I still believe to be law, notwithstanding the doctrine in <em>Cock </em>v. <em>Taylor </em>to the contrary ; it is submitted that they do not warrant the inference, which seems to have been adopted by the court below, that it is the <em>receipt </em>of goods alone which determines the liability to pay freight.</p>\n<p data-order=\"148\" data-type=\"legal\" id=\"b691-6\">In <em>Wilson </em>v. <em>Kymer, </em>(1 M. &amp; <em>S. </em>157,) the defendants were endorsees of the bill of lading. The goods went into the dock company\u2019s stores, and defendants afterwards received them out of store <em>on the order of the consignees.</em></p>\n<p data-order=\"149\" data-type=\"legal\" id=\"b691-7\">(It does not appear if the order was on the bill of lading, or on a separate piece of paper. In the case before the court, it was on the bill of lading.)</p>\n<p data-order=\"150\" data-type=\"legal\" id=\"b691-8\">It was held that the defendant was not liable, because he had not received the goods under the bill of lading, but on the order.</p>\n<p data-order=\"151\" data-type=\"legal\" id=\"b691-9\">He was, however, held liable on another ground.</p>\n<p data-order=\"152\" data-type=\"legal\" id=\"b691-10\">In <em>Scarf </em>v. <em>Sir John </em>Tobin, (3 <em>Barn. </em>&amp; <em>Adol. </em>523,) defendant was the consignee by name, but was held not liable for general average, though he had received the goods with notice of the claim.</p>\n<p data-order=\"153\" data-type=\"legal\" id=\"b691-11\">In <em>Sanders </em>v. <em>Vanzeller, </em>(4 Q. <em>B. Rep. </em>260,) defendant had purchased a cargo of wool from the consignee, paid part of the purchase money, and stipulated in writing to pay the balance, and the freight. He afterwards refused to pay, on the ground that the article was not according to sample; but, nevertheless, <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"676\">*676</page-number>he received the wool and sold it for his advances. He was holden not liable for the freight.</p>\n<p data-order=\"154\" data-type=\"attorneys\" id=\"b692-4\"><em>Ward </em>v. <em>Felton, </em>(1 <em>East, </em>507,) is another case in point.</p>\n<p data-order=\"155\" data-type=\"legal\" id=\"b692-5\">In all the cases cited <em>contra, </em>and referred to by the court be- \u2022 low, (with the exception of <em>Trask </em>v. <em>Duval,) there was no consignee named; </em>the bill of lading being to \u201c order.\u201d This is always considered enough to put the master on inquiry. It is a suspicious circumstance. It is very different, w'hen a well known name appears on the bill of lading. Among hundreds of packages arriving in the New-York packets, there are very few shipped \u201c to order.\u201d</p>\n<p data-order=\"156\" data-type=\"legal\" id=\"b692-6\">In England, the shipper alone, prior to 1790, was holden liable for freight. Afterwards, the consignee, as well as the shipper, was holden. And finally, for the convenience of trade, and to favor the ship owner, and not the consignee, it was holden that the receiver of the goods, under the bill of lading, was also liable.</p>\n<p data-order=\"157\" data-type=\"legal\" id=\"b692-7\"><em>Cock </em>v. <em>Taylor, </em>(13 <em>East, </em>399,) is, perhaps, the earliest reported case maintaining this doctrine. It was a case of goods shipped on board a vessel, bound to London, by Montgomery &amp;,. Co., at Alicante, to the order of Hargreaves &amp; Co., of Algiers. The bill of lading was endorsed by Hargreaves &amp; Co., to Peters, of Gibraltar; and by Peters again endorsed to Taylor &amp; Son, of London, who received the goods.</p>\n<p data-order=\"158\" data-type=\"legal\" id=\"b692-8\">It was right that Taylor should pay. It would have been very unjust to have sent the master back to Algiers, and all round the globe to get his due.</p>\n<p data-order=\"159\" data-type=\"legal\" id=\"b692-9\">If the defendant had colluded with the shippers to cheat the master, it was right that he should pay.</p>\n<p data-order=\"160\" data-type=\"legal\" id=\"b692-10\">If he was an innocent purchaser, he was still liable; because, under the circumstances, it was his duty to see that his title was clear, before he paid his money. There was enough to put him on inquiry; as there was also in the case before the court.</p>\n<p data-order=\"161\" data-type=\"legal\" id=\"b692-11\">In <em>Trask </em>v. <em>Duval, </em>(4 <em>Wash. C. C. R. </em>180,) the captain refused to deliver the goods to the consignee, unless the freight was first paid. The defendant then came forward and agreed, <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"677\">*677</page-number>that if the consignee did not pay, he would ; and he took an assignment of the bill of lading, and received the\" goods and sold them.</p>\n<p data-order=\"162\" data-type=\"legal\" id=\"b693-5\">The court held him liable for the freight on his <em>promise </em>to pay it.</p>\n<p data-order=\"163\" data-type=\"legal\" id=\"b693-6\">In <em>Tobin </em>v. <em>Crawford, </em>Coupland &amp; Duncan, who received the goods at London, where they were unladen, (the defendant did not live there,) were represented to be the agents of Crawford. But the court was not satisfied that such was the case. (5 <em>Mees. Sr Weis. </em>239, Parke, J.)</p>\n<p data-order=\"164\" data-type=\"legal\" id=\"b693-7\">And lord Abinger expressly puts the decision on the ground, that the credit was not given to the defendant, but to Coupland &amp; Duncan, the <em>plaintiff having charged them in his books with the freight.</em></p>\n<p data-order=\"165\" data-type=\"legal\" id=\"b693-8\">In all of these cases, the decision was according to the substantial justice and equity of the case ; and it would be rather a singular spectacle to see the courts of this country, \"where, in many respects, strange as it may sound, the law' is much less favorable to commerce than it is in England, measuring out the strict measure of technical law in every case, without any regard to its peculiar characteristics.</p>\n<p data-order=\"166\" data-type=\"legal\" id=\"b693-9\">In England, the master, where freight is unpaid, can enter the goods in his own name, and so collect what is due him.</p>\n<p data-order=\"167\" data-type=\"legal\" id=\"b693-10\">All the American authorities assert that it can be done here; <em>but it is not so.</em></p>\n<p data-order=\"168\" data-type=\"legal\" id=\"b693-11\">It never has been done in practice, and there is nothing in the laws of congress allowing it to be done.</p>\n<p data-order=\"169\" data-type=\"legal\" id=\"b693-12\">So in England, and on the continent, where goods are invoiced too low, with a view to defraud the government in the duties, the goods are not seized and confiscated as with us, but the government takes them \u25a0 from the importer at ten per cent, over his valuation, and pays the freight. With us, the government officers will not take any notice of a claim put in for freight on goods while in the public stores. It is not so in England. In this country, it is even doubtful if the government officials would be bound by an injunction out of the state <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"678\">*678</page-number>courts, or be in any way subject to the operation of state laws. <em>(Harris </em>v. <em>Dennie, </em>3 <em>Peters, </em>303.)</p>\n<p data-order=\"170\" data-type=\"legal\" id=\"b694-4\">But granting that they are liable, and granting that in a case like the present, the consignee is not; it amounts then to this: That every owner of a packet ship must stand ready, on every arrival of his ship, with a stereotyped bill in chancery and injunction, to plaster on every single case of goods which has not been \u201cpermitted,\u201d within fifteen days after arrival. If this be so, and if the consignee can relieve himself from all liability, by assigning over his bill of lading, perhaps to a fictitious person, perhaps to one living in Chicago, or in Seringapatam, (and that person can again assign it over <em>ad infinitum,,) </em>then we shall require a new judiciary act, and some hundreds of new elective judges, with equity powers to hold their chambers, perhaps, in the corners of the merchants\u2019 warehouses, and their courts on the ends of the piers.</p>\n<p data-order=\"171\" data-type=\"legal\" id=\"b694-5\">The happy effect of such a state of things on commerce, and on the community at large, may well be conceived.</p>\n<p data-order=\"172\" data-type=\"legal\" id=\"b694-6\">W\u00e9 have done well heretofore, under the general belief, among merchants, that \u201c the consignee is primarily liable for the freight,\u201d (as the late Mr. Chancellor Kent expresses it.)</p>\n<p data-order=\"173\" data-type=\"legal\" id=\"b694-7\">I entreat the court to beware how they overturn this ancient doctrine. This case is a test case; it is not an action brought to recover a few hundred dollars, but to settle a principle ; as such, the decision of the court of last resort is anxiously looked for, particularly by those who, from the peculiar nature of their carrying trade, are most interested\u2014the owners of the packets sailing from the port of New-York.</p>\n<p data-order=\"174\" data-type=\"legal\" id=\"b694-8\">One word more ; with regard to the mention made by defendants\u2019 witness, Bonnay, of Mr. Boisgerard, one of the plaintiffs, and the allusion to him by the counsel at the close of his argument.</p>\n<p data-order=\"175\" data-type=\"legal\" id=\"b694-9\">Mr. Boisgerard is a Frenchman by birth, though naturalized here, having received his mercantile education in this city, some thirty years ago. He is a merchant at Havre, and has not been in this country for twenty years, (as I am credibly informed.)

J., Bronson, Gardiner, Wright, R\u00fcggles and Johnson, JJ. <em>For </em>reversal\u2014Jones and Gray, JJ.</p>\n<p id=\"b695-6\">Note.\u2014As there does not appear to be any written opinion by this court, it is presumed they adopted the opinion of the supreme court, (4 <em>Denio, </em>110,) Jewett, justice, which held,\u2014That the obligation to pay freight rested on the bill of lading, by which its payment was made a condition of delivery to the consignee or his order. The master was not bound to part with the goods until the freight was paid; but did not, by delivering the goods before payment, waive or discharge his legal right to demand payment of the person who, by the principles of law, was primarily liable to pay.</p>\n<p id=\"b695-7\">It was well settled, that when the goods, by the terms of the bill of lading, are to be delivered to the <em>consignee or to his order </em>on payment of freight; the party <em>receiving </em>them, whether the consignee, or endorsee, to whom the bill of lading has been transferred by the consignee, makes himself responsible for the payment of the freight. The law implies a promise on his-part to pay the freight; such being the terms on which, by the bill of lading, the goods were to be delivered. By the act of accepting and receiving, the party makes himself a party to the contract.</p>\n<p id=\"b695-8\">In this case, the goods were consigned to the defendants, <em>or to their order </em>They endorsed the bills of lading, and ordered a delivery to Mainon &amp; Bonnay, to whom the goods were delivered. <em>They, </em>and <em>not </em>the defendants, were therefore bound to pay the freight.</p>\n<p id=\"b695-9\">\n<em>Jfot reported.</em>\n</p>\n</opinion>\n</casebody>\n",
