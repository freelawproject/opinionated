(10 <em>Wend. R. </em>818.)</p>\n<p data-order=\"22\" data-type=\"attorneys\" id=\"b199-13\">Jggg\u201c Sup. court decided this on authority of 6 <em>Hill, </em>484.</p>\n<p data-order=\"23\" data-type=\"legal\" id=\"b199-14\"><em>Second. </em>If trespass would lie against the general owner for interference with Stief\u2019s possessory title, it will lie against the sheriff for the same cause, unless the sheriff, by virtue of an execution, can acquire a greater right of control over, and a greater interest in, the property of the execution defendant than the latter himself has.</p>\n<p data-order=\"24\" data-type=\"legal\" id=\"b199-15\"><em>Third. </em>The 2d Revised Statutes, page 366, sec. 20, authorizes the <em>\u201c </em>right and interest\u201d of a pledgor to be sold on execution, but does not interfere with the rights of a pledgee.</p>\n<p data-order=\"25\" data-type=\"legal\" id=\"b200-3\"><page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"184\">*184</page-number>In this property, the right to the possession was in Stief, and of course the possessory title of the general owner had been divested, and could not be sold; yet the sheriff took the property from the possession of Stief; an act which the general owner himself could not do.</p>\n<p data-order=\"26\" data-type=\"legal\" id=\"b200-4\"><em>Fourth. </em>The greater power includes the less; and if sections 20 and 23, as declared by the court in 6th <em>Hill, </em>484, gives the sheriff the power to have the property in view when sold, that power may, and therefore ought, to be exercised without removing the property from the possession of the pledgee. If the sheriff can remove, he can also enter upon the pledgee\u2019s premises to sell, and may advertise it to be sold without removal, and thus leave the rights of the pledgee undisturbed.</p>\n<p data-order=\"27\" data-type=\"legal\" id=\"b200-5\"><em>Fifth. </em>The statute does not confer upon the sheriff power to remove the property, because,</p>\n<p data-order=\"28\" data-type=\"legal\" id=\"b200-6\">1. At common law, the sheriff could not remove pledged property without paying the lien; <em>(Story on </em>Bailment, 238, <em>sec. </em>353;) though the \u201c right and interest \u201d of the pledgor could be sold on execution. (4 <em>Wend. </em>292.)</p>\n<p data-order=\"29\" data-type=\"legal\" id=\"b200-7\">2. The statute, secs. 20 and 23, 2 <em>R. S. </em>367, does not alter, but is merely declaratory of the common law. <em>(Revisers\u2019 </em>Notes, <em>part </em>3d, <em>chap. </em>6, <em>title </em>5, <em>secs. </em>17 <em>and </em>20; 17 <em>J. R. </em>116; 14 <em>do. </em>222.) Except that as to power of sheriff to sell assigned or bailed goods, the decisions were conflicting. <em>(Revisers\u2019 Jiotes ; </em>5 <em>J. R. </em>345; 4 <em>Cowen, </em>469.)</p>\n<p data-order=\"30\" data-type=\"legal\" id=\"b200-8\">3. If \u201cpersonal property\u201d in the 23d section includes the \u201c right and interest of a pledgor in the 20th section, then the last clause of the 23d section must also apply to pledged property, and the sheriff who takes it must offer it for sale in such <em>\u201c lots and parcels as will bring the highest price j\u201d </em>whereas pledged property must be <em>sold in one </em>parcel, and <em>cannot </em>be divided.</p>\n<p data-order=\"31\" data-type=\"legal\" id=\"b200-9\"><em>Sixth. </em>To allow the sheriff to remove the property from the possession of the pledgee would impair his security; as if the sheriff should destroy, sell or make way with the property, the pledgee would have only the sheriff\u2019s personal responsibility, which might be, and in <em>this </em>case <em>was good for </em>nothing, the <em>sheriff </em>being largely <em>insolvent.</em></p>\n<p data-order=\"32\" data-type=\"legal\" id=\"b201-4\"><page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"185\">*185</page-number><em>Seventh. </em>The sheriff did not in any manner recognize the pledgee\u2019s lien, hut proceeded in hostility to, and denial of it, as appears from the evidence; and the court should therefore have .charged the jury that the sheriff was a trespasser. (23 <em>Wend. R. </em>653, 668, 669.)</p>\n<attorneys data-order=\"33\" data-type=\"attorneys\" id=\"b201-5\">O. H. Platt, <em>Attorney for plaintiff.</em></attorneys>\n<p data-order=\"34\" data-type=\"legal\" id=\"b201-6\">I shall take a narrower view than in these points\u2014 the simple question decided by the judge. (34-5.)\u2014At common law, judgment and execution give the sheriff no greater right over the property than the defendant himself has. <em>(Sewell\u2019s Law of </em>Sheriffs, 225; <em>Com. Dig. Exn. c. </em>4.) Sheriff cannot take goods in pledge. <em>(Brooke\u2019s Ab. Pledge, pl. </em>24.) May be taken on execution on satisfying the pledge. <em>(Brooke\u2019s Ab. Exn. pl. </em>107; <em>Sewell Sheriff, </em>242.) Sheriff cannot sell <em>absolutely. {Story Bailt. </em>\u00a7 286.) Not liable to be taken in execution, at least not unless the pledge is at an end. <em>In this state of the law comes our statute. </em>Decision of supreme court carries the statute by construction further than it ought to go; ought to be restricted, as statute against the common law. 6 <em>Hill, </em>484, our case decided on this case. Must be sold <em>in one lot. </em>Statute for selling in <em>parcels </em>cannot apply. (2 <em>Dwar. Stat. </em>750.) Construction of statutes.\u2014Powers derogatory to private property must be construed strictly. <em>(Lofft. </em>438.) Statute giving a new remedy construed strictly.

S. </em>366) authorizes the sale of the <em>\u201c </em>right and \"interest \u201d of the <em>pledgor </em>in goods and chattels, on execution against him. And the 23d section of the same statute declares that no <em>personal property </em>shall be exposed for sale, unless the same be <em>present </em>and <em>toithin the view </em>of those attending the sale.
