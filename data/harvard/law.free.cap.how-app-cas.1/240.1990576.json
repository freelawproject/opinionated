Hon. Nathan Dayton, Circuit Judge. A special verdict was found, by which it appeared that the premises in question, with other lands, situated in the counties of Monroe and Orleans, were mortgaged by one Henry Davis and his wife to the Farmers\u2019 Fire Insurance and Loan Company in December, 1833, to secure $12,000. In February, 1834, Davis and wife conveyed the premises in question, in fee, to Henry J. Hollister, who conveyed the same in fee to Abraham M. Sehermerhorn on the 27th March, 1835. On the 24th February, 1840, the Farmers\u2019 Loan and Trust Company as successors, by statute, <em>(Sess. </em>Laws, 1836,) of the Farmers\u2019 Fire Insurance and Loan Company, filed their bill of complaint before the chancellor for the foreclosure of this mortgage. That besides Henry Davis and wife, the mortgagors, Abraham M. Sc-hermerhorn and wife, Joseph D. Beers, President of the North American Trust and Banking Company, and others, were made defendants, as persons claiming some interest in the mortgaged premises, &amp;c., but Cornelius Van Geisen, the defendant, was not made a party.</summary>\n<summary data-order=\"6\" data-type=\"summary\" id=\"b257-5\">The bill of complaint was duly taken as confessed by all the defendants. A reference was ordered, to ascertain the amount, and a decree entered directing that the mortgaged premises \u201c be sold at public auction according to the course and practice of said court, by or under the direction of Benjamin L. Bessac, one of the masters of said court, residing in the county of Orleans ; that the said sale be made in the county where the mortgaged premises, or the <em>greater part thereof \\ </em>were situated, &amp;c. The decree proceeded to give the usual directions, and some special directions as to the sale of any parcels of the premises sold since the execution of the mortgage.</summary>\n<summary data-order=\"7\" data-type=\"summary\" id=\"b257-6\">That lot No 4, sec. 11, town 4, lots 10, 11, and 12, sec. 7, town 4, in all containing 480 acres, were described in said decree as situate in the town of Clarendon, and county of Orleans, whereas in fact, the same was situate in the town of Clarkson, and county of Monroe; so that from the decree it appeared that the greater part of the lands directed to be sold were situate in the town of Clarendon', and county of Orleans, when in fact <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"242\">*242</page-number>the greater part thereof were situate in the town of Clarkson, and county of Monroe. But the aggregate value of the lands situate in the county of Orleans was greater than that of the lands situate in the county of Monroe.</summary>\n<summary data-order=\"8\" data-type=\"summary\" id=\"b258-4\">On the llth of September, 1841, at the village of Albion, in the county of Orleans, the master sold the premises in question, which were bid off by the plaintiff Fuller ; and on receiving the amount of the purchase, gave Fuller a master\u2019s deed.</summary>\n<summary data-order=\"9\" data-type=\"summary\" id=\"b258-5\">That the defendant, Van Geisen, was in possession of the premises in question prior to the filing of the bill of complaint, and continued in possession until after the commencement, of this suit. Fuller exhibited to Van Geisen his master\u2019s deed, and informed him that he had become the owner of the premises, and inquired of Van Geisen by what right he claimed to hold said premises, and Van Geisen replied, \u201c that he went into possession under a contract for the purchase of said premises made between him and Abraham M. Schermerhorn. The said James C. Fuller then inquired of the defendant if he had made the payments for the said land to the said Schermerhorn, as they became due according to the terms of his agreement with the said Schermerhorn; and he replied that he had not. That Fuller then informed him that if he would pay to him the amount which he had promised to pay said Schermerhorn for said lands, and which he had not been paid, that he, said Fuller, would convey to him the said lands. This the defendant declined doing; and stated that he did not intend ever to pay anything further toward the purchase of the lands. That Fuller then demanded possession of said lands from the said defendant, which the defendant refused to give, and thereupon this suit was commenced on the 9th day of October, 1841.\u201d The order for confirmation of the report of the master\u2019s sale became absolute on the 20th of January, 1842.</summary>\n<summary data-order=\"10\" data-type=\"summary\" id=\"b258-6\">The charter of the Farmers\u2019 Loan and Trust Company contained a provision that \u201c all sales under the mortgages to be taken or holden by the said corporation, &amp;c., shall be made in the county where the said mortgaged property shall be situated.\u201d</summary>\n<summary data-order=\"11\" data-type=\"summary\" id=\"b259-4\"><page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"243\">*243</page-number>Judgment was rendered for plaintiff for the possession of the premises at January term, 1843. <em>(Reported </em>4 <em>Hill, </em>171.)</summary>\n<summary data-order=\"12\" data-type=\"summary\" id=\"b259-5\">The defendant brought a writ of error, and removed the judgment into this court.</summary>\n<attorneys data-order=\"13\" data-type=\"attorneys\" id=\"b259-6\"><em>Haight </em>&amp; <em>Chase, Attorneys and</em></attorneys>\n<attorneys data-order=\"14\" data-type=\"attorneys\" id=\"b259-7\"><em>Chauncey Tucker, Counsel </em>for plaintiff in error.</attorneys>\n<p data-order=\"15\" data-type=\"legal\" id=\"b259-8\"><em>First. </em>The sale under which the defendant in error claims title to the premises described in the declaration, was inoperative and void, because the same was not made in the county where the property was situated. <em>(Sess. Laws of </em>1822, <em>ch. </em>50, \u00a7 3, <em>p. </em>47; 21 <em>Wend. </em>467; <em>Sess. Laws of </em>1836, <em>p. </em>281.)</p>\n<p data-order=\"16\" data-type=\"legal\" id=\"b259-9\"><em>Second. </em>Although the sale should he deemed legal, the defendant in error was not entitled to recover, because at the time of commencing his suit, the sale had not been confirmed. (13 <em>Ves. </em>517; 11 <em>id. </em>559, <em>ex 'parte Minor.)</em></p>\n<p data-order=\"17\" data-type=\"legal\" id=\"b259-10\">1. The decree upon foreclosure provides that the purchaser be let into possession of the premises on production of the master\u2019s deed, and a certified copy of the. order confirming the sale, if the same has become absolute. <em>(Rule </em>135 <em>of court of chancery.)</em></p>\n<p data-order=\"18\" data-type=\"legal\" id=\"b259-11\">2. Independent of the provisions of the decree, the purchaser has only a contingent title until the order confirming the sale has become absolute, as until that time the purchaser or any party in interest may apply for a resale. <em>(Brown </em>v. <em>Frost, </em>10 <em>Paige, </em>247.)</p>\n<p data-order=\"19\" data-type=\"legal\" id=\"b259-12\">3.

S. </em>192, \u00a7 158.)</p>\n<p data-order=\"38\" data-type=\"legal\" id=\"b261-7\">But if the report and confirmation were necessary to complete the title, those things when done make the title perfect <em>by relation </em>from the execution of the deed. (1 <em>Johns, cases, </em>75, 84, 89; 3 <em>Cowen, </em>75, 80; 15' <em>Johns. </em>309-316; 20 <em>Johns. </em>3; 2 <em>Wend. </em>507.)</p>\n<p data-order=\"39\" data-type=\"legal\" id=\"b261-8\"><em>Third. </em>The sale gave to the plaintiff in this suit all the rights of the mortgagee, and of Schermerhorn who held as grantee of the mortgagor\u2014subject to the rights and equities which defendant had against Schermerhorn before the sale.</p>\n<p data-order=\"40\" data-type=\"legal\" id=\"b261-9\">The sale is at least as effectual as a statute foreclosure would have been had Schermerhorn been the mortgagor, and that would give the purchaser all the rights of mortgagor and mortgagee. (4 <em>Paige, </em>58, 61.)</p>\n<p data-order=\"41\" data-type=\"legal\" id=\"b261-10\">The rights of all the parties to the suit are expressly cut off by the decree; of course, they must be vested in the purchaser. <em>{Case,pp. </em>8, 9.)</p>\n<p data-order=\"42\" data-type=\"legal\" id=\"b261-11\">The sale was equivalent certainly to a <em>voluntary conveyance </em>by all the parties.</p>\n<p data-order=\"43\" data-type=\"legal\" id=\"b261-12\">If then any, or all the parties to the suit united, could have maintained ejectment against Van Geisen, this plaintiff can do soi</p>\n<p data-order=\"44\" data-type=\"legal\" id=\"b261-13\"><em>Fourth. </em>Schermerhorn before the sale could have maintained ejectment against Van Geisen\u2014and the plaintiff being possessed of all his rights, can do it.</p>\n<p data-order=\"45\" data-type=\"legal\" id=\"b261-14\">1st. The defendant claimed to hold under Schermerhorn, which shows that his right, whatever it might he, was subordinate to that of the parties to the suit in chancery. <em>(Case, p. 12.)</em></p>\n<p data-order=\"46\" data-type=\"legal\" id=\"b262-3\"><page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"246\">*246</page-number>2. The contract does not appear to have been in writing; and if it was, it could not be established by parol proof. (15 <em>Wend. </em>588-592; <em>Cowen </em>&amp; <em>Hill's Notes to Phil. Ev. p. </em>544, <em>note </em>416.)</p>\n<p data-order=\"47\" data-type=\"legal\" id=\"b262-4\">3. But if his contract was in writing, he had made default, and was liable to ejectment. <em>(Jackson </em>v. <em>Moncrief, </em>5 <em>Wend. </em>26 ; <em>Jackson </em>v. French, 3 <em>Wend. </em>337.)</p>\n<p data-order=\"48\" data-type=\"legal\" id=\"b262-5\">If the defendant had any remedy, it was in equity, and could not be made available at law. <em>(Jackson v. Pierce, </em>2 <em>John. </em>221.)</p>\n<p data-order=\"49\" data-type=\"legal\" id=\"b262-6\">4. The holding by Van Geisen was not adverse so as to affect the validity of the sale to the plaintiff, even treating it as a private sale. <em>(Jackson </em>v. <em>Johnson, </em>5 <em>Cowen, </em>74; <em>Jackson </em>v. <em>Camp, 1 Cow. </em>605.)</p>\n<p data-order=\"50\" data-type=\"legal\" id=\"b262-7\">The doctrine of adverse possession does not apply to sales under judgments and decrees. <em>(Jackson </em>v. <em>Collins, </em>3 <em>Cow. </em>89; <em>Jackson </em>v. <em>Anderson, 4 Wend. </em>474.)</p>\n<attorneys data-order=\"51\" data-type=\"attorneys\" id=\"b262-8\">H.

Besides, all question upon that matter was removed by the doctrine of relation. The confirmation of the sale related to the date of the deed; thus overreaching the claim of a mere intruder into the premises.</p>\n<p id=\"b262-13\">As to the rights of the defendant, <em>held, </em>that Schermerhorn (under whom he claimed to hold by contract) and all other proper parties having been brought into court, and the defendant being a mere naked possessor, although in before the bill was filed, had taken no title by which he stood connected in any way with the mortgagor or those claiming under him; no right of his was overreached, because he had none.</p>\n<p id=\"b262-14\"><em>Held, </em>that had the sale been made under a power contained in the mortgage, <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"247\">*247</page-number>the auction must have been in the counties respectively where the lands lay. But the provision in the charter did not take away the jurisdiction of the court of chancery. Even if the provision be regarded as mandatory and restrictive upon the court, it was but directory; and the most, that could have been done by way of impeaching the decree wras to appeal. The proceeding could not be inquired into collaterally. The decree binds till it is reversed. The charter might be satisfied by confining it to a summary foreclosure, by advertisement.</p>\n<p id=\"b263-5\">The master governed himself by the location appearing on the face of the decree, in which he was right. The defendants in the chancery suit were the onty persons who could complain. And they were then precluded. A mere stranger could not raise the question collaterally.</p>\n<p id=\"b263-6\">Judge Cowen said the case might be stated in this way : \u201c The decree misjudges on a material fact, the location of the land; and a stranger claims to contradict it by a special verdict.\u201d</p>\n<p id=\"b263-7\">\n<em>Jfot reported in this court.</em>\n</p>\n</opinion>\n</casebody>\n",
