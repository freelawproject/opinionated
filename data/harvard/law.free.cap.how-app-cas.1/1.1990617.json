The defendant did not appear. The plaintiff called <em>Jonas Dinegar </em>as a witness, who testified that he drew off the account from the plaintiff\u2019s books, and sent it to defendant; that the defendant called soon after at the plaintiff\u2019s store and said he wanted to settle; witness showed defendant plaintiff\u2019s books, and said he was authorized to settle.

The admission furnished all the evidence of the correctness of the account that the law requires, and the defendant was bound to establish his offset by testimony.</p>\n<opinion data-order=\"20\" data-type=\"opinion\" id=\"x999-1\" type=\"majority\">\n<author id=\"b19-4\"><page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"3\">*3</page-number>Jewett, Chief Judge,</author>\n<p id=\"ACq\">delivered an oral opinion substantially as follows: This cause originated in a Justice\u2019s Court. The judgment of the justice was reversed by the Common Pleas of Columbia county, and affirmed by the late Supreme Court.</p>\n<p id=\"b19-5\">The plaintiff declared in the Justice\u2019s Court on account for services rendered, and an account stated\u2014bill on file. The defendant did not appear in any stage of the proceedings, a bill of items was presented by the plaintiff, containing items for work, labor, and services done and performed, and materials furnished, and goods and chattels sold. This bill formed a part of the declaration, and we think that the counsel for the plaintiff in error is mistaken in the law, that this declaration was not sufficient to sustain the judgment under the proof. We think it is; but the plaintiff in error insists that the proof is insuffipient; that the whole admission of Pierce must be taken together; and that taking it together, it does not make out the case of the plaintiff below. The witness states that he copied the bill from the books of the plaintiff, and sent it to defendant. This bill amounted to some \u00a7194, and contained credits amounting to about \u00a7110, leaving a balance of \u00a784'12 due plaintiff. A few days afterwards defendant called at plaintiff\u2019s store and said he wanted to settle; witness showed defendant the books of plaintiff, and said he was authorized to settle with him; defendant said the account was correct, but he had an pffset. Nothing was said by defendant as to the nature or amount of his offset; it might have been \u00a740, or it might have been \u00a71; and it was his duty to have exhibited by proof the amount of it before he could avail himself of it to reduce the plaintiff\u2019s claim. There wTas sufficient in the admission to establish the correctness of the plaintiff\u2019s claim, and that was all the law required. The defendant did not make out a set-off by <em>saying </em>he had one, and his omission to prove it on the trial authorized the plaintiff to recover the whole amount of his bill. We think the Supreme .Court were right, and that the judgment must be affirmed.</p>\n<p id=\"b19-6\">Judgment affirmed, unanimously.</p>\n<p id=\"b19-7\"><em>Reported in the Supreme Court, </em>3 <em>Denio, </em>315. <em>Reported in this court, </em>3 <em>How. Pr. R. </em>162.</p>\n<p id=\"b20-3\"><page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"4\">*4</page-number>Note.\u2014The whole confession of a party, when resorted to as evidence against him, must be taken together, although it does not follow that all is entitled to credit.</p>\n<p id=\"b20-4\">The part of a confession which it is claimed makes against the party calling it out, must he certain and full; and enough to constitute a'defence if proved by other testimony.</p>\n<p id=\"b20-5\">Hence, where a defendant admitted the correctness of an account that was shown him, but at the same time said he had \u201c an offset,\u201d held, that the plaintiff\u2019s case, was made out, and defendant was bound to <em>prove </em>his set-off on the trial.</p>\n</opinion>\n</casebody>\n",
