F. Allen, as proctor for the appellant, who was the trustee, or executor, named in the instrument propounded as a will, presented a petition to David B. Ogden, Esq., surrogate of the city and county of New-York, stating that the decedent left'assets or personal estate in the city and county of N'ew-York; and praying that the instrument propounded might be admitted to probate, and that letters testamentary thereon might be granted. The next of kin of the decedent were duly cited to attend before the surrogate, and the public administrator, having taken out administration on the estate of Joseph Leo Wolf, was also cited; and they resisted the probate of the instrument propounded, upon the ground that a married woman could not, under the provisions of the revised statutes, make a will of personal estate, even with the consent of her husband.</summary>\n<summary data-order=\"20\" data-type=\"summary\" id=\"b519-16\">The surrogate sustained the objection, and rejected the instrument propounded as a will upon that ground alone.

(2 <em>R. S. </em>60, \u00a7\u00a7 24, 25; <em>Laws of </em>1837, 524, \u00a7\u00a7 4, 10, 11, 17, <em>'[&gt;\u25a0 </em>68, \u00a7 67.)</p>\n<p data-order=\"52\" data-type=\"legal\" id=\"b522-12\"><em>Second. </em>There was no proof of the due execution of the instrument propounded as a will. (2 <em>R. S. </em>61, \u00a7 26; 3 <em>Bl. Com. </em>498, <em>History of these instruments ; Lovelace Wills, </em>267 ,\u2022 <em>Jarmin Wills, </em>24; 15 <em>Ves. </em>156.)</p>\n<p data-order=\"53\" data-type=\"legal\" id=\"b522-13\"><em>Third. </em>Whether since the revised statutes a married woman can execute a power of appointment, in the nature of a will, over personal property, held by her as a separate estate, when such power is contained in the instrument creating the estate, is a question which does not arise in the present case. Here there is no such power; on the contrary, the policy, by m airing the insurance payable to the children in the event of Mrs. <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"507\">*507</page-number>Leo Wolf\u2019s not surviving her husband, precludes such an idea. But were there such a power, and were its execution valid in equity, as a testamentary disposition,, there is nothing to authorize the instrument being admitted to- probate by the surrogate, as a will of personal property, whatever may be the practice of the ecclesiastical courts in England. (2 <em>R. S. </em>56, \u00a7.1;60, \u00a720.)</p>\n<p data-order=\"54\" data-type=\"legal\" id=\"b523-5\"><em>Fourth. </em>The surrogate\u2019s court, as it now exists, is not, as were the court of chancery and the supreme court, a court of general jurisdiction, but a mere creature of the statute; and whatever jurisdiction is claimed for it must be affirmatively shown. Its powers are by no means co-extensive with, or to be deduced from, those of the ecclesiastical courts in England. To authorize a surrogate to admit a paper to probate, it is therefore necessary that the instrument should be such as he is empowered to\" receive, and that it should have been executed by a person coming within the provisions of the law giving jurisdiction to the officer. (2 <em>R. S. </em>173, \u00a7 1; 196, \u00a7 1; 220, \u00a7 1; <em>Glynn </em>v. <em>Oglander, </em>2 <em>Hagg. </em>432; 1 <em>R. L. </em>444; <em>Rev. </em>Notes, 3 <em>R. S. </em>679; <em>Dakin </em>v. Hudson, 6 <em>Cow. </em>221; <em>Bloom </em>v. Burdick, 1 <em>Hill, </em>130.) No power has been given to the surrogate to receive and admit to probate an instrument purporting to be the will of a married woman. (2 <em>R. S. </em>56, \u00a7 1; 60, \u00a7 21, 23, 26, <em>p. </em>61, \u00a7 29, 30; 3 <em>Tomlin\u2019s L. D. </em>802.)</p>\n<p data-order=\"55\" data-type=\"legal\" id=\"A0P\"><em>Fifth. </em>The provisions of the revised statutes, respecting &lt;\u00a3 Powers \u201d and \u201c Uses and Trusts,\u201d have reference exclusively to real estate, except as regards limitations of future or contingent interests in personal property, and in no way relate to the execution of \u201c Powers \u201d by married women in respect to personal property. <em>(Kane </em>v. <em>Gott, </em>24 <em>Wend. </em>661.)</p>\n<p data-order=\"56\" data-type=\"legal\" id=\"b523-7\">Jt@\u201c\u201c 1 <em>R. S. </em>735, \u00a7\u00a7 110,115, power by grant or devise as to real estate, but not as to personal. \u201cgBU.</p>\n<p data-order=\"57\" data-type=\"legal\" id=\"b523-8\"><em>Sixth. </em>The power to make a will being regulated by the statute, and a married woman being expressly excluded from its provisions, any will made by her must necessarily be void. Even before the revised statutes, a married woman could not make a will, though she might have executed a testamentary <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"508\">*508</page-number>paper in the nature of a will. But whether even that, with the then undefined- powers of the surrogate\u2019s court, would have been admitted to probate, in analogy to the course adopted by the ecclesiastical courts in England, is at least doubtful. (2 <em>Bl. Com. </em>12; 2 <em>Roper, Hus. and Wife, </em>188; <em>Stone </em>v. <em>Forsyth, Doug. </em>707, <em>n.; </em>3 <em>Atk. </em>166, <em>n. ; Tappenden </em>v. <em>Walsh, </em>1 <em>Phill. </em>353; <em>Stevens </em>v. <em>Baywell, </em>15 <em>Ves. </em>156; 2 <em>R.S. </em>60, \u00a7 21; <em>1R.L. </em>367, \u00a716; 3 <em>Johns.
