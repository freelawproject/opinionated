The declaration counted upon a charter party of affreightment, alleged to have been made by the defendant with the plaintiff. That the plaintiff, by the name and description of J. D. Cathell, master and agent of the schooner or vessel called the Sage of Vienna, of the burthen of 150 tons or thereabouts, register measurement, then lying in the harbor of New-York, of the first part, and Medad Platt, of the city of New-York, agent for J. C. &amp; M. Stevenson, of Newbern, of the second part, chartered the vessel to the defendant for a voyage from Newbern, N. C., to Barbadoes and two other ports to leeward of Barbadoes; and the defendant covenanted to furnish for her a cargo of lumber, <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"231\">*231</page-number>and to pay the freight thereon at a certain price per thousand, &amp;c. The declaration alleged the fitness of the vessel, the actual lading of her by the defendant, and the performance of, the voyage by the plaintiff, and assigned a breach of the covenants for non-payment of the freight. The defendant pleaded <em>non est factum </em>and a special plea, as follows :</summary>\n<summary data-order=\"5\" data-type=\"summary\" id=\"b247-5\">And for a further plea in this behalf the said Medad Platt, by leave of -the court here for this purpose, first had and obtained according to the form of the statute in such case made and provided, says that the said Jonathan D. Gathell ought not to have or maintain his aforesaid action thereof against him, because he says that the said charter party of affreightment was made and executed by James C. Stevenson and Martin Stevenson by the name and description in the year one thousand eight hum afterward at the city and county of New-York aforesaid had' notice; and the said defendant avers that he had full and sufficient authority from the said James C. Stevenson and Martin Stevenson, and was properly and duly authorized,, by them to sign, seal, execute, and deliver the said charter party of affreightment as and for the act and deed of them, the said James C. and Martin Stevenson; and that-the signing, sealing, execution, and delivery of the said charter party of affreightment by this defendant as their agent for and as the act and deed of them, the said James C. Stevenson and Martin Stevenson, hath been fully ratified and confirmed by them, the said James C. Stevenson and Martin Stevenson, as and for their act and deed subsequent to the signing, sealing, execution, and delivery of the said charter party of affreightment by this defendant, as such agent as aforesaid, to wit, on the third day of December, in the year one thousand eight hundred and forty-one, and often afterward, to wit, at the city and county of New-York aforesaid, Newbern, by the Said Medad Platt said charter party of affreightmen defendant in his capacity of agent James C.

C. &amp; M. Stevenson to sign, seal, execute and deliver the said charter party, yet he does not state in what manner the said authority was conveyed to him; and also, for that although\u201d the defendant states that the1 said charter party was ratified by the said J.

And also that by the said declaration it is alleged and appears in the oyer of the said charter party that the charter party therein named was sealed and delivered by the said defendant in his own name and as his own deed, and not in the name or as the deed of any other person, which the said plea doth not deny nor confess and avoid.</summary>\n<summary data-order=\"8\" data-type=\"summary\" id=\"b248-6\">The defendant joined in demurrer. The superior court gave judgment for the plaintiff on the demurrer. On the trial of the issue of fact the charter party was given in evidence by the plaintiff, as follows:</summary>\n<summary data-order=\"9\" data-type=\"summary\" id=\"b248-7\">This charter party, made and concluded upon in the city of New-York, the twenty-third day of December, in the year one thousand eight hundred and forty-one, between J.

instrument, that the said parties of the second part shall be allowed for the loading and discharging of the vessel at the respective ports aforesaid lay days as follows, that is to say: at Newbern ten running days, and at Barbadoes and two other ports in the West Indies, dispatch without unnecessary detention, and in case the vessel is longer detained, the said parties of the second part agree to pay to the said party of the first part demurrage at the rate of twenty Spanish milled dollars per day, day by day, for every day so detained, provided such detention shall happen by default of the said parties of the second part, or their agents.</summary>\n<summary data-order=\"17\" data-type=\"summary\" id=\"b250-5\">It is also further understood and agreed that the cargo or cargoes shall be

C., by the Messrs. Stevenson, who put a supercargo on board, who sold the cargo at the outward-bound ports and purchased and superintended the return cargo.</summary>\n<summary data-order=\"25\" data-type=\"summary\" id=\"b251-5\">The defendant moved that the plaintiff should\u2019 be non-suited, on the ground of variance between the charter party and the declaration, and that the charter party was the act and deed of the Messrs. Stevenson and not of the defendant; and upon the further ground that the proof on the part of the plaintiff showed that the plaintiff, from the making of the charter party, during the whole voyage, and until the final completion thereof, treated the Messrs. Stevenson as the parties of the second part in the instrument; and that by the acts of the plaintiff he had put such a construction on the charter party as precluded him from treating the defendant as the party of the second part.</summary>\n<summary data-order=\"26\" data-type=\"summary\" id=\"b251-6\">The Court, Jones, Ch. J., decided that the charter party was set out in the declaration according to its legal effect, and that the charter party was the deed of the defendant and not of the Messrs. Stevenson; and that the plaintiff was not precluded by his conduct from treating it as the deed of the defendant. The defendant excepted.</summary>\n<summary data-order=\"27\" data-type=\"summary\" id=\"b251-7\">The defendant then introduced in evidence two letters from the Messrs. Stevenson to himself, authorizing the defendant to engage a vessel, and approving of the charter of the plaintiff.</summary>\n<summary data-order=\"28\" data-type=\"summary\" id=\"b251-8\">The chief justice charged the jury that the charter party was in judgment of law, under the circumstances in evidence before them, the deed of the defendant, and submitted to the jury the question of damages. The defendant\u2019s counsel excepted to the charge. The jury found a verdict for plaintiff for $735.</summary>\n<summary data-order=\"29\" data-type=\"summary\" id=\"b251-9\">A motion for a new trial by the defendant, at general term, was denied. The defendant brought a writ of error and removed the judgment to the supreme court, where the judgment of the superior court was affirmed. <em>Reported </em>3 <em>Denio, </em>604.</summary>\n<summary data-order=\"30\" data-type=\"summary\" id=\"b251-10\">The defendant brought a writ of error, and removed the judgment into this court.</summary>\n<attorneys data-order=\"31\" data-type=\"attorneys\" id=\"b252-3\"><page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"236\">*236</page-number><em>Mills </em>&amp; <em>Beckwith, Attorneys and</em></attorneys>\n<attorneys data-order=\"32\" data-type=\"attorneys\" id=\"b252-4\"><em>A.

Affixation of seal by agent in presence of principal is good. <em>(Story, Agency, </em>\u00a7 51, <em>and authorities cited, n. </em>2.) Even if authority were by instrument under seal, it is not necessary to be averred. <em>(Bailiffs of Ipswich </em>v. <em>Marston, Cro. Ja. </em>411; <em>Dean </em>v. <em>Grover, 2 Sand. </em>302, 305, <em>a. b. n. </em>13; 1 <em>Chit. Pl. 253, 7th Amer. from 6th London ed. a. authorities cited in n. g.; </em>6 <em>Com. Dig. Pleader e. </em>9.)</p>\n<p data-order=\"35\" data-type=\"legal\" id=\"b252-7\"><em>Second. </em>It is unnecessary to aver in pleading <em>how </em>ratification was made. <em>{The authorities above cited, except the first.)</em></p>\n<p data-order=\"36\" data-type=\"legal\" id=\"b252-8\"><em>Third. </em>Plea not double. The real fact averred is the agency of defendant and his authority. <em>(Story on Agency, </em>\u00a7\u00a7 244,251; <em>McLean </em>v. <em>Dunn, </em>4 <em>Bing. </em>722.) Several facts may be pleaded amounting to one result. (1 <em>Chit. Pl. </em>564.) Averment of authority is a general term, embracing both previous power and subsequent ratification. Averment therefore of subsequent ratification may be tautology, but is not duplicity.</p>\n<p data-order=\"37\" data-type=\"legal\" id=\"b252-9\"><em>Fourth. </em>True, the declaration alleges that defendant signed and sealed the charter party as and for his own deed. But the plea denies <em>this, but </em>admits a signing, and avoids the effect which the plaintiff seeks to give it, by averring agency and authority. <em>(White </em>v. <em>Skinner, </em>13 <em>J. R. </em>307; <em>Randall </em>v. <em>Van Vechten, </em>19 <em>J. R. </em>60; <em>Stone </em>v. <em>Wood, </em>7 <em>Cole, </em>453.)</p>\n<p data-order=\"38\" data-type=\"legal\" id=\"b252-10\"><em>Fifth. </em>The declaration is insufficient. <em>{Fols. </em>16, IT.) Charter has never commenced.</p>\n<p data-order=\"39\" data-type=\"legal\" id=\"b252-11\">II.-AS TO BILL OF EXCEPTIONS.</p>\n<p data-order=\"40\" data-type=\"legal\" id=\"b252-12\"><em>First. </em>Charter party should have been excluded, because of the variance. The phrase \u201c parties of the <em>second </em>part,\u201d in the charter party, by just construction, means the Stevensons. But the declaration alleges it to mean the defendant. The contract is not set forth according to its true meaning and effect. <em>(Corning </em>v. <em>Townsend, </em>23 <em>Wend. </em>409; <em>Blood </em>v. <em>Goodrich, </em>9 <em>Wend. </em>77.) If liable at all, Platt is only liable for the performance of the du<page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"237\">*237</page-number>ties assigned to them in the contract. <em>(Principle of construction, 2 K. Com. </em>554-5; <em>Code Napoleon, </em>\u00a7\u00a7 1156,1164; 3 <em>Chit. Com. </em>Law, 391; <em>Leery </em>v. <em>Goodson, </em>4 T. R. 689.) Evidence of an agreement to deliver goods to defendant is a fatal variance from a count on an agreement to deliver them to a third person.\u2014 <em>Id. (Churchill </em>v. <em>Wilkins, </em>1 <em>T. R. </em>447; <em>Samuel </em>v. <em>Parch, 2 Stark. C. </em>60; <em>Wyvill </em>v. Shepard, <em>1 H. Bl. </em>162.)</p>\n<p data-order=\"41\" data-type=\"attorneys\" id=\"b253-5\"><em>Second. </em>Deposition of Lynch should have been rejected.</p>\n<p data-order=\"42\" data-type=\"legal\" id=\"b253-6\">[Not mentioned.]</p>\n<p data-order=\"43\" data-type=\"legal\" id=\"b253-7\">The deposition of Lynch in no way shows any act done by or on behalf of the defendant. It is wholly <em>res inter alios. </em>If the phrase \u201c parties of the second part \u201d means nobody but Platt, then the'Stevensons were wholly unconnected with him, and their acts could not make him responsible.</p>\n<p data-order=\"44\" data-type=\"legal\" id=\"b253-8\"><em>Third. </em>Plaintiff should have been non-suited. Non-suit should have been granted,</p>\n<p data-order=\"45\" data-type=\"legal\" id=\"b253-9\">1. For variance, and</p>\n<p data-order=\"46\" data-type=\"legal\" id=\"b253-10\">2. Because, in addition to the facts in the charter party itself to show that it was Stevensons\u2019 contract, the plaintiff had him-' self put a construction on it to that effect.</p>\n<p data-order=\"47\" data-type=\"legal\" id=\"b253-11\"><em>Fourth. </em>The court below erred in charging the jury that the charter party was, in judgment of law, under the circumstances in evidence, the deed of the defendant. The question of agency and authority should have been submitted to the jury; whereas the whole case was taken from them but the amount of damages. Platt had done enough to make his principals liable. A charter party may be without seal. (3 <em>Chit. Com. Law, </em>388.) It is only when the act of agency is required to be done under seal that the authority by seal is necessary. <em>(Story Ag. </em>\u00a7\u00a7 49,154; <em>Evans </em>v. <em>Wells, 22 Wend. </em>324, 339, 340-1, Verplanck, <em>senator.) </em>The use of a seal where none was necessary will not vitiate an act which without the ceremony would have been valid. <em>(Everitt </em>v. <em>Strong, </em>5 <em>Hill, </em>163; <em>Anderson </em>v. <em>Tompkins, </em>1 <em>Brock, C. C. </em>456; <em>White </em>v. <em>Cuyler, </em>6 <em>T. R. </em>176.)</p>\n<attorneys data-order=\"48\" data-type=\"attorneys\" id=\"b253-12\">Mills &amp; Beckwith, <em>Attorneys for plaintiff in error.</em></attorneys>\n<attorneys data-order=\"49\" data-type=\"attorneys\" id=\"b253-13\">A. C. Bradley, <em>of Counsel.</em></attorneys>\n<attorneys data-order=\"50\" data-type=\"attorneys\" id=\"b254-3\">\n<page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"238\">*238</page-number>\n<em>D. D.

It is not competent for the defendant below, in a plea, not traversing the execution of the deed as alleged, to <em>aver </em>a different effect, or different description of party in the deed. He must either call for <em>oyer </em>of the deed, and demur, or rest on excluding the deed for variance on the trial. The deed must speak for itself, and can not be varied by averment. For this reason the second plea was bad.</p>\n<p data-order=\"54\" data-type=\"legal\" id=\"b254-7\"><em>2. </em>The second plea, not denying the execution of the deed as averred in the declaration, could not vary its effect by alleging that he was an agent and executed ft in that character; for an agent may bind himself personally for his principal in an instrument in which he is also named as agent. The second plea was bad also, for this cause.</p>\n<p data-order=\"55\" data-type=\"legal\" id=\"b254-8\">3. The deed? as set out in the declaration, being under seal of the defendant, he was bound to show legal authority to bind his principal: this required authority by deed, and oyer of such authority, in order that the plaintiff might see on what ground he could pursue the principal. The second plea was also bad, for want of profert of such supposed authority. <em>(Bender </em>v. <em>Sampson, </em>11 <em>Mass. Rep. </em>44.)</p>\n<p data-order=\"56\" data-type=\"legal\" id=\"b254-9\">' 4. The second plea was in like manner bad, for not showing ratification of the covenant by a deed of the principals, and for not containing profert of that deed. <em>(Blood </em>v. <em>Goodrich, </em>9 <em>Wend. R. </em>68 ; <em>Story on Agency, </em>\u00a7\u00a7 49, 275, 273, 161, 155, 278.)</p>\n<p data-order=\"57\" data-type=\"legal\" id=\"b254-10\">5. The second plea was also bad, for duplicity. Either previous authority or subsequent ratification, properly alleged, would be a good answer, if an answer at all. It was therefore double to tender issue on both. <em>(Stephen on Pleading, </em>258, \u00a7 3, <em>rule </em>1.) The plaintiff could, in replying, only tender issue on one of the answers, and therefore would be compelled to confess the other.</p>\n<p data-order=\"58\" data-type=\"legal\" id=\"b254-11\">The demurrer therefore was rightly adjudged for the plaintiffs.</p>\n<p data-order=\"59\" data-type=\"legal\" id=\"b255-4\"><page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"239\">*239</page-number><em>Second. </em>The charter party given in evidence was sealed with the seal of the defendant only: he calls himself party in the attestation ; he is the only party of the second part executing the deed, and alone was bound by it as a deed.</p>\n<p data-order=\"60\" data-type=\"legal\" id=\"b255-5\">The defendant has shown no authority under seal to execute a deed. He has shown no ratification by deed. He has not shown any communication to the plaintiff, either of his authority or of the ratification before suit brought.</p>\n<p data-order=\"61\" data-type=\"legal\" id=\"b255-6\">On every principle, therefore, the defendant was the party of the second part, and bound as such. <em>(Talbot </em>v. <em>Godbolt, Yel</em>verton, 137; <em>Stone </em>v. <em>Wood, </em>7 <em>Cow. R. </em>453; <em>Spencer </em>v. <em>Field, </em>10 <em>Wend. </em>87; <em>Pentz </em>v. <em>Stanton, id. </em>276; <em>Stone </em>v. <em>Gordon, </em>3 <em>Maule </em>&amp; <em>Sel. </em>322; <em>Townsend </em>v. <em>Corning, </em>23 <em>Wend. R. </em>439; <em>S. C. </em>4 <em>Hill\u2019s R. </em>357; <em>Com. Dig. Fait, C. </em>2, <em>D. </em>2, <em>l. n.; Abbot on Shipping, </em>163, <em>part </em>3, <em>ch. </em>1, \u00a7 2, <em>old ed.; new ed. </em>244, <em>part </em>4, <em>ch. </em>1, \u00a7 1.)</p>\n<p data-order=\"62\" data-type=\"legal\" id=\"b255-7\"><em>Third. </em>The charter party, while it showed that the defendant, by the form of the instrument, its attestation and execution, was the party contracting personally, also showed his representative position, so that,</p>\n<p data-order=\"63\" data-type=\"legal\" id=\"b255-8\">1. The defendant covenanting personally for the Messrs. Stevenson, all acts in carrying out the adventure done to or by them, are, in judgment of law, done to or by the defendant as covenanting for their benefit; the averments, therefore, of the declaration are legally and substantially true.</p>\n<p data-order=\"64\" data-type=\"legal\" id=\"b255-9\">2. The defendant directed the plaintiff to obey the orders of Stevensons; consequently all acts in carrying out the charter, done to or by them, were for this reason also, in judgment of law, done to or by the defendant.</p>\n<p data-order=\"65\" data-type=\"legal\" id=\"b255-10\"><em>Fourth. </em>The question, what the defendant said as to the effect of the deed which he was signing is clearly inadmissible, as an attempt to vary the effect of a deed by an oral qualification. <em>(.Evans </em>v. <em>Wells, </em>22 <em>Wend.
