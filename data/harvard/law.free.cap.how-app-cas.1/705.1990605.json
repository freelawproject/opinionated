Mosher, <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"706\">*706</page-number>the respondents, for the specific performance of an agreement alleged to have been made by said Isaac Closson with said Joseph Slocum.</summary>\n<summary data-order=\"6\" data-type=\"summary\" id=\"b722-4\">The agreement, as set out in the bill, was dated the 11th June, 1833, made between Isaac Closson, of Schaghticoke, of the first part, and Joseph Slocum, of the village of Syracuse, of the second part; for the consideration of one hundred dollars, Closson contracted, and agreed to sell to Slocum, the equal undivided half part of a farm, situated in the town of Schaghticoke, county of Rensselaer, of which Robert Closson died seized, (giving the boundaries,) containing about two hundred and fifty acres.</summary>\n<summary data-order=\"7\" data-type=\"summary\" id=\"b722-5\">The said Closson agreed to execute and deliver to the said Slocum a warranty deed for said land, upon condition that Slocum, his heirs, or assigns, paid to the said Closson, his heirs, or assigns, for the same, the sum of thirty dollars for each acre, in one half of said farm, which was to be surveyed. It being then supposed that said farm contained two hundred and fifty acres, the half of which would be $3,750, of which $100 was paid in hand, and the remaining $3,650 to be increased or diminished, as the half of said farm should overrun or fall short of one hundred and twenty-five acres, to be paid by tfie 1st September next. The said Slocum, for himself, his heirs, executors and administrators, covenanted and agreed to and with said Closson, his heirs, and assigns, that said Slocum would pay the said several sums as they became due, without any deduction of taxes or assessments whatever. And it was further agreed, that if default be made in fulfilling the agreement, or any part thereof, on the part of said Slocum, then said Closson, his heirs and assigns, should be at liberty to consider the contract as forfeited and annulled, and to dispose of the said land to any other person, in the same manner as if the contract had never been made. (Signed, Isaac Closson, l.s.)</summary>\n<summary data-order=\"8\" data-type=\"summary\" id=\"b722-6\">The bill alleged, that a counterpart of the agreement was signed and sealed by Joseph Slocum, and delivered to said Closson. Also that said Slocum, at the time of executing said agreement, paid to said Closson the sum of one hundred dol<page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"707\">*707</page-number>lars, as a part of the consideration to he given as aforesaid. That Slocum, in expectation that a deed would be executed to him by said Closson of said premises, pursuant to the terms of the agreement, went from Syracuse to Schaghticoke in the latter part of the month of August, and notified said Closson that he was prepared and desirous to pay the said purchase money for said land, and to receive a conveyance thereof. That on or about the 27th of August, Slocum requested said Closson, in writing, that he would cause an accurate survey of said premises to be made, or that he would unite with the agent of Slocum in employing a surveyor, and other necessary assistants, to make the survey; and informing said Closson, in case he should decline to comply with said request, he, Slocum, would cause such survey to \u00b0be made. That Closson, on receiving such communication, stated, in substance, that Slocum could- go on and make the survey; that it was not-necessary for him to attend. Thereupon the agent of Slocum, on the 30th August, 1833, caused such survey to be made by an- experienced surveyor ; on which survey it was ascertained that said farm contained two hundred and fifty acres only. That Slocum, on the 31st August, caused a deed of said premises to be made out in pursuance of the agreement, and went in search of said Closson, with said deed, and with the purchase money, for the purpose of paying said Closson, and obtaining the execution of said deed. That Closson designedly avoided said Slocum, and attempted to prevent an interview with said Slocum, by passing from place to place, and shut himself up for a time, with the design of prevepting said Slocum .from tendering him the purchase money, and obtaining the execution of said deed. That Slocum pursued said Closson to the town of Stillwater, and there found him, apparently attempting to conceal himself from' said Slocum; and when discovered, said Closson at first refused to suffer said Slocum to enter the house where he was; that then, on the 31st of August, 1833, said Slocum, having with him upwmrds of $4,000, offered to pay said Closson the said purchase money of the said farm, in pursuance of the terms of the aforesaid agreement; and informed said Closson that the <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"708\">*708</page-number>money was then there ready for him to receive, and that said Slocum was desirous to pay it to him, and receive the conveyance of said land. That said Slocum then informed Closson that he had there a conveyance, drawn conformable to the terms of the said agreement, for said Closson to execute, and requested him to execute the conveyance on' receiving the purchase money. That, during said conversation, said Closson stated that there was more land in said farm than appeared in the survey made for said Slocum; that thereupon said Slocum offered to pay him for all the land so contracted to be sold, whatever the true quantity should be, and to receive a conveyance of the whole of said Closson\u2019s share.</summary>\n<summary data-order=\"9\" data-type=\"summary\" id=\"b724-4\">That said Closson wholly declined, and refused to receive said purchase money, or to execute such conveyance, and left said Slocum, apparently attempting to elude the offer of said Slocum. Afterwards, on the 2d September, 1833, said Slocum, by his agent, again attempted to induce said Closson to receive said purchase money, and execute such conveyance, but- said Closson could not be found.</summary>\n<summary data-order=\"10\" data-type=\"summary\" id=\"b724-5\">The bill charges that said Closson still wholly refused to receive said purchase money, and to execute said deed.</summary>\n<summary data-order=\"11\" data-type=\"summary\" id=\"b724-6\">The bill further charged, that on or about the 2d September, 1833, said Closson executed a conveyance of said premises to Joseph P. Mosher, which was recorded on the 3d September, which conveyance was wholly unknown to said Slocum at the time of filing his bill of complaint. Charges that said deed to Mosher was executed and recorded in fraud of said Slocum\u2019s rights, and was obtained and received by said Mosher with an intent to defraud said Slocum. That at the time the deed was so executed, the said Mosher, who was the brother-in-law of said Closson, well knew of said bargain and sale to said Slocum, and the payment made on said contract, and of the offer made as aforesaid by said Slocum, to pay the residue of the purchase money, and to receive a deed, in pursuance of his contract with said Closson.</summary>\n<summary data-order=\"12\" data-type=\"summary\" id=\"b724-7\">The defendants answered, without oath, and admitted the seizure of said premises by said Closson, in and before the <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"709\">*709</page-number>month of June, 1833. Admitted the execution of the agreement by Closson to Slocum of said premises, as stated in the bill. But alleged that the same was so signed, by the said Closson, by the fraudulent procurement, and false \u25a0 and fraudulent representations of said Slocum. That long before the execution of such agreement, to wit: in or about the year 1828, the said Joseph P. Mosher had applied to Closson to purchase his, said Closson\u2019s, share of said farm; that Closson then agreed, or promised, to sell the same to him, but no price was then agreed upon between them, and Closson soon after left the state of New-York for St. Louis.</summary>\n<summary data-order=\"13\" data-type=\"summary\" id=\"b725-5\">That while he, Closson, remained in thatiegion of country, and between the years 1828 and 1833 inclusive, said Mosher, in the expectation and belief that he was to purchase and have the interest or share of said defendant, Closson, in said farm; and at the request of said Closson, sent him, from time to time, various sums of money, amounting in the whole to $500. That in or about the month of March, 1833, Mosher, being desirous to close up the business, and get a conveyance from said Closson, having previously written several times, again wrote to said Closson, enclosing him $200, and requesting him, without delay, to set his price upon said farm, that the business might be closed. In answer to which, Closson wrote, about the 25th March, 1833, agreeing to take thirty dollars per acre for his share or interest in said farm. That immediately thereafter Mosher wrote to said Closson, accepting said proposition; and also procured a deed of said premises to be prepared for Closson to execute; and caused the same to be sent by mail to Closson, at the same time requesting him to execute the deed and return it to said Mosher, by mail, agreeing to send Closson the residue of the purchase money in a draft, by mail, or to pay, or secure the payment thereof, in such other manner as Closson should direct.</summary>\n<summary data-order=\"14\" data-type=\"summary\" id=\"b725-6\">That said last mentioned letters, and said deed, were received by Closson, by due course of mail; and that Closson would have immediately executed said deed, and returned the same by mail, but having made his arrangements for leaving St. Louis <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"710\">*710</page-number>and returning to the state of New-York, on a visit to said Mosher, concluded to delay the execution of said deed until he arrived at the residence of said Mosher, in Easton, in the state of New-York.</summary>\n<summary data-order=\"15\" data-type=\"summary\" id=\"b726-3\">That while said Closson was on his way to said Mosher\u2019s,' with the intention of executing said deed on his arrival, and having the same in his possession with that intent and purpose, he, Closson, met with said Slocum, and one Wm. B. Slocum, his father, at the village of Syracuse, in the county of Onondaga, N. Y., at which place said Wm. B. Slocum, who pretended to act as an agent for his sons, said Joseph Slocum and one Hiram Slocum, or one of them, but who, as he alleged, was acting for his own benefit and interest, as well as in behalf of his sons, commenced a conversation with said Closson in relation to the purchase by the said sons, or one of them, of the share or interest of said Closson in said farm; that Closson then told both the complainant and Wm. B. Slocum, that he had agreed to sell his share of said farm to Joseph P. Mosher, and that said Mosher had sent him a deed thereof to be executed, which he had with him, and intended to execute it when he arrived at the residence of said Mosher; that both the complainant and said Wm. B. Slocum then averred, and stated to and assured said Closson, that said Mosher did not wish, and did not intend to purchase said Closson\u2019s interest in said farm; that said Mosher intended to, and was about to sell his interest in said farm to the said Hiram Slocum; and that said Mosher had suffered the farm, and fences thereon, to remain and be in a ruinous state, for the want of proper and necessary care and husbandry; and urging said Closson, as he.and the said Joseph and Hiram Slocum were old friends and school-mat\u00e9s, to sell the same to them. That in consequence of such representations the said Closson, supposing the same to be true\u2014as the said Wm. B. Slocum represented that he had then, within a few days, seen the said Joseph P. Mosher\u2014was induced to receive the said one hundred dollars, and to sign the said agreement, which complainant alleged was for the benefit of Hiram Slocum, or for Hiram and himself. But defendants alleged and-<page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"711\">*711</page-number>averred that said contract was also, in part, for the benefit o\u00ed said Wm. B. Slocum.</summary>\n<summary data-order=\"16\" data-type=\"summary\" id=\"b727-5\">The answer alleged that said Joseph, Wm. B., and Hiram \u25a0Slocum, well knew that said Mosher was the owner of the one equal undivided half part of said farm, as tenant in common with said Closson, and had contracted with said Closson for the purchase of his interest.</summary>\n<summary data-order=\"17\" data-type=\"summary\" id=\"b727-6\">The defendant, Mosher, alleged that one of the means made use of by said complainant and Wm. B. Slocum, to procure and obtain said contract or agreement from said Closson, was by getting him intoxicated with ardent spirits.</summary>\n<summary data-order=\"18\" data-type=\"summary\" id=\"b727-7\">Denied that complainant ever notified Closson that he was prepared and desirous to pay him the purchase money for said premises, and to receive a conveyance therefor; or ever tendered or offered to pay the same; or ever tendered a deed, to be executed by Closson, as alleged.</summary>\n<summary data-order=\"19\" data-type=\"summary\" id=\"b727-8\">Denied that complainant, in writing or otherwise, ever requested Closson to have the farm surveyed, as alleged in the bill of complaint; or that complainant ever caused an accurate survey of the same to be made.</summary>\n<summary data-order=\"20\" data-type=\"summary\" id=\"b727-9\">Admitted said Closson had refused, and still did refuse, to convey his interest in said farm to complainant, for the reasons before stated in the answer. That Closson, as soon as he discovered the fraud practised upon him, offered to pay back the said one hundred dollars, with interest, which offer was refused by complainant.</summary>\n<summary data-order=\"21\" data-type=\"summary\" id=\"b727-10\">Admitted, that on or about the 2d September, 1833, Closson conveyed his interest in said premises to Mosher, and that the deed was recorded on or about the 3d September, 1833. But alleged that such conveyance was in pursuance of the aforesaid agreement, made between said Closson and said Mosher, which agreement was well known to the complainant.</summary>\n<summary data-order=\"22\" data-type=\"summary\" id=\"b727-11\">The foregoing contains, in substance, the bill and answer in the cause. The cause being at issue upon a general replication put in by the complainant, an order was, on the 18th May, 1834, entered, requiring the respective parties to produce witnesses.</summary>\n<summary data-order=\"23\" data-type=\"summary\" id=\"b728-3\"><page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"712\">*712</page-number>[It is impossible to do justice to this case without giving the evidence almost entire, as the decision of the cause necessarily rests upon the construction and weight of such evidence.] ,</summary>\n<summary data-order=\"24\" data-type=\"summary\" id=\"b728-4\">The complainant introduced witnesses, and the depositions were taken as follows:\u2014</summary>\n<summary data-order=\"25\" data-type=\"summary\" id=\"b728-5\">On this 26th of May, 1836, personally appeared before me, John J. Hill, an examiner in chancery, <em>John </em>Wilkinson, a witness produced on the part of the complainant, who, being duly affirmed and orally examined by the counsel for said complainant, says,\u2014that he resides at Syracuse, in the county of Onondaga, and is thirty-seven years of age : I am acquainted with the complainant in this cause, and am partially acquainted with Isaac Closson, one of the defendants; but I do not know Joseph P. Mosher, the other of said defendants. On or about the 11th day of June, 1833, I saw Mr. Joseph Slocum, the complainant, and the said Isaac Closson. They came to my office in Syracuse, for the purpose of having an instrument drawn, by which Mr. Closson was to convey a farm in Rensselaer county to Mr. Slocum. I drew the instrument marked as Exhibit I, which the said Closson executed, and delivered to Mr. Slocum, and to which I signed my name as the subscribing witness. There was a counterpart of the same instrument, made at the same time, and delivered to Mr. Closson, which said counterpart was executed by Mr. Slocum, the complainant.</summary>\n<summary data-order=\"26\" data-type=\"summary\" id=\"b728-6\">If I remember right, he, the said Isaac Closson, was then on <em>his </em>return from Missouri, where he had been for some time previous, and I think as long as three years previous, as he stated to me. I talked to him a good deal at length about the western country, particularly about that part of Missouri where he had been residing. He told me a great deal about it, and that he was going .to return to Missouri. This conversation was had with Mr. Closson while he was in my office, waiting for the papers to be prepared. I do not remember that any other person was in company with Mr. Isaac Closson than Mr. Slocum. He, Mr. Closson, talked more about the bargain than Mr. Slocum, and gave more directions about drawing the pa<page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"713\">*713</page-number>pers than Mr. Slocum. It was towards night when Mr. Closson and Mr. Slocum came to my office, and the writings were executed before they left. I did not discover that Mr. Closson, at this time, was at all affected with liquor, and I think the conversation I had with him, concerning his travels in the west, &amp;c., was_ such, that if he had been at all affected by liquor, I should have been able to discover it. I took a considerable interest in the conversation.</summary>\n<summary data-order=\"27\" data-type=\"summary\" id=\"b729-5\">The said witness, on being <em>cross-examined </em>by the counsel for the defendants, says,\u2014I first became acquainted with the complainant 'about the year 1824. I think Mr. Slocum paid me for drawing the instruments; whether he paid me at the time, or afterwards, I am not certain; but I think I charged the same to Mr. Slocum. I never saw Mr. Closson before the time he came to my office, to my knowledge, nor have I seen him since.</summary>\n<summary data-order=\"28\" data-type=\"summary\" id=\"b729-6\"><em>Ephraim Congdon, </em>being sworn, says,\u2014that he resides in1 the town of Schaghticoke, in the county of Rensselaer, and is acquainted both with the complainant, and Isaac Closson and Joseph P. Mosher, the defendants in the above suit, and has known them for some years past; that in March, in the year one thousand eight hundred and thirty-two, he, the witness, applied to Joseph P. Mosher for some money, through another person; that on the twenty-seventh day of March, in the year one thousand eight hundred and thirty-two, he received of said Mosher the money applied for, and gave him his, the witness\u2019s, note for the same; that when said Mosher counted out said money to him, the witness, he remarked that a part of that money had been sent, by mail, either to St. Louis, in Missouri, or to some of the villages in the vicinity of St. Louis; that he had forwarded it there, directed to Isaac Closson; that the said money had been returned to Mr. Mosher; that when the money was put into the post-office by Mosher, said Closson was west of Missouri, on a hunting expedition, and when Closson returned, the postmaster refused to deliver it to him, supposing that he, Closson, was not the man to whom it was sent, and thereupon the said postmaster returned the same money to said Mosher; the amount so returned was two hundred dollars, as <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"714\">*714</page-number>he believes; the 'money was in two one hundred dollar bills; that he, the witness, did not learn from the said Mosher on what account the said money was so sent to said Closson. That the amount of the money which he, the witness, received of said Mosher, was five hundred dollars; that the person through whom he applied for said money was Stephen Batty, of Easton.</summary>\n<summary data-order=\"29\" data-type=\"summary\" id=\"A1t\"><em>William M. Dennis, </em>being sworn, says,\u2014that he resides in the town of Lansingburgh, in the county of Rensselaer, and is acquainted with the complainant, Joseph Slocum, and the defendants, Isaac Closson and Joseph P. Mosher, the defendants in the above suit; that in the month of June, in the year one thousand eight hundred and thirty-three, Isaac Closson, one of the above defendants, called on him, the witness, at his store in Lansingburgh, and stated that he was then on his return from the Rocky Mountains, or St. Louis, or some place at the west; that said Isaac had then with him a gun and a gold watch, which appeared to be new; that he, the witness, then asked him, the said Isaac, how he got funds to buy those articles, and whether he had received any money from Mr. Mosher. Said Isaac then stated to him, the witness, that he had sold his farm to Joseph Slocum of Syracuse, and that said Joseph Slocum had advanced him some money upon it; the amount mentioned he, the witness, does not now recollect. He, the witness, asked him what he got for his farm; and he, the said Isaac, replied, that he got thirty dollars an acre for it. Whereupon he, the witness, remarked to him, that he had sold the farm for less than what it was worth; and said Isaac then told him, that was all he expected to get for it, and all he asked for it; and that he sold it to the first man who offered him his price for it. Witness then asked him if he had entered into writings for the sale of the farm; to which said Closson replied that he had, and that he was to have the cash for the farm on the first day of September, then next ensuing. He, the witness, asked said Isaac why he did not sell the farm to Mr. Mosher; to which the said Isaac replied, that said Mosher wished to purchase it for a less price. The witness thinks that said Isaac stated, that Mr. Mosher wished to buy it for twenty-<page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"715\">*715</page-number>eight dollars for the acre, or had offered him that for it. &gt; .Thai at the time of this conversation he, the witness, understood from the Said Isaac, that he was then on his way home from the west, and had not then been to Schaghticoke since his return from the west. \u2022</summary>\n<summary data-order=\"30\" data-type=\"summary\" id=\"b731-5\"><em>William M. </em>Dennis, being <em>cross-examined </em>by the counsel for the defendants, says,\u2014that the said Isaac Glosson appeared to be addicted to the free use of ardent spirits before he left Schaghticoke and went to the westward; that on his return he, the witness, thought, from his appearance, that the habit of indulging in the free use of spirituous liquors had grown upon him while he was absent at the west, which was five or six years, as he thinks; that it was about one or two o\u2019clock in the afternoon when the said Isaac Glosson called on him, the witness, as stated in his testimony on his direct examination, and that said Isaac appeared then to have been drinking spirituous liquors, and appeared to be under the influence of liquor in some degree, but still was so that he could converse freely, and walk without staggering; that he, the witness, was with said Isaac on that day an hour or two, and saw him, during the time he was in his company, drink spirituous liquors two or three times. That in the interview he, the witness, had with \u2022 said Isaac, as before stated, he, the said Isaac, appeared to be irritated towards Mr. Mosher, and used much harsh language against him; that when witness asked him why he had not sold the farm to Mosher, rather than to a stranger, said Isaac replied that Mosher had not sent him funds as he ought to have done, although he had repeatedly written to him for them, and he supposed that Mosher thought that he would never return; and that Mosher wanted to get the farm for a less price than it was worth, and that he never should have it; that there was money coming to him, the said Isaac, for the rent of the farm; but he, the witness, did not understand from the said Glosson from whom said rent was coming; that he, the witness, had an impression upon his mind that he once knew of Mr. Mosher inclosing and sending money to the said Glosson, per mail, while he was at the west, but as to this he is not positive; that in <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"716\">*716</page-number>this conversation, said Glosson stated that a deed for conveying the farm to him, the said Mosher, had been sent to him, for him to execute, but he said that the deed was filled up for a less sum than his price, or less than what he thought the farm was worth, and therefore he declined to execute it; that he don\u2019t recollect that said Isaac mentioned who the deed was filled up by, or who sent it to him; that he received it a short time before he started to come home; that the witness understood from said Glosson that he made the bargain for the sale of the farm to said Slocum, at Syracuse, on his way home; that witness believes that said Glosson stated that he saw William Slocum at Syracuse, on his way home, and that he also saw Mr. Fish there, with whom he was acquainted; that he don\u2019t recollect that said Glosson stated any of the particulars of his said bargain made in Syracuse, further than he, the witness, has already stated.</summary>\n<summary data-order=\"31\" data-type=\"summary\" id=\"b732-4\"><em>William M. Dennis, </em>being further examined by the counsel for the complainant, says,\u2014that it is his impression, that in the conversation he had with said Isaac, as before stated, he understood from said Glosson that there was money coming to him for the rent of the farm, which he expected to have received through Mr. Mosher; and it is his impression that he then understood, from said conversation, that it was the money coming to him for the rent of the farm of which he complained that Mosher had not sent him; that he,,the witness, felt interested for Mr. Mosher, which was the reason of his having so particular conversation with said Glosson in relation to his sale of the farm.</summary>\n<summary data-order=\"32\" data-type=\"summary\" id=\"b732-5\"><em>Gerrit Fort, </em>being sworn, says,\u2014that he resides in the town \u25a0of Cambridge, in the county of Washington, and is acquainted with Joseph Slocum, the complainant, and Isaac Glosson and Joseph P. Mosher, the defendants in the above suit; that some time in the month of July, in the year one thousand eight hundred and thirty-three, about three or four weeks after Mr. Closson returned from the west, Hiram Slocum, Isaac Glosson, and Joseph P. Mosher came to his house in Schaghticoke, where he then lived, and had a conversation relative to the sale of the <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"717\">*717</page-number>farm of Isaac Closson to Joseph Slocum. They came there in the fore part of the day, remained there more than an hour, and left his house before eleven o\u2019clock in the forenoon. He does not recollect that anything particular was said about the manner in which the bargain was made between said Closson and said Joseph Slocum for the purchase of said <em>farm; </em>but Mr. Closson stated that it was a fair and honorable transaction on the part of said Joseph Slocum. This he stated in the presence and hearing of said Mosher. That as far as he, the witness, discovered, said Closson was then perfectly sober. That he, the witness, during several weeks immediately after said Closson returned from the west, frequently saw said Closson, and that he always, during that time, with the exception of twice, appeared to him, the witness, to be perfectly free from the influence of spirituous liquors. That he does not recollect that there was anything, during the conversation, said of any unfairness on the part of said Joseph Slocum, in relation to the making of the bargain for the sale of said farm, to him. There was something said about the situation of the farm, and said Closson said that he wished Mr. Mosher to have the farm. That Mr. Hiram Slocum, whether voluntarily or on the request of some one present, he, the witness, does not recollect, stated that he would write to his brother, Joseph Slocum, and request him to relinquish his bargain for said farm, and that he presumed he would do it on receiving back the hundred dollars which he had paid Closson, and receiving a small compensation, say about fifteen or twenty dollars, for his trouble.</summary>\n<summary data-order=\"33\" data-type=\"summary\" id=\"b733-5\"><em>Gerrit Forty </em>being <em>cross-examined </em>by the counsel for the dendants, says,\u2014that at the time of the conversation mentioned in his testimony on his direct examination, he resided about half a mile from the residence of Hiram Slocum, and a little over three miles from the residence of Joseph P. Mosher; that he thinks the said Isaac Closson, Joseph P. Mosher, and Hiram Slocum, did not, at that time, come to his house together, and he thinks that Isaac Closson and Joseph P. Mosher came first, but of this he is not certain; that soon after said Closson and Mosher came, if they came first, Hiram Slocum came; that the <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"718\">*718</page-number>conversation which he has stated in his testimony on his direct examination, took place when they all three of them were there together. That he does not know that said Hiram then showed a letter from his brother Joseph Slocum ; that he, the witness, had seen a letter before that time, which said Joseph Slocum had written to said Hiram, and heard the said Hiram read the same, or a part of it, but does not recollect that said Hiram showed said letter at the time of said conversation.</summary>\n<summary data-order=\"34\" data-type=\"summary\" id=\"b734-4\"><em>Question. </em>Did the said Joseph, in that letter, authorize him, the said Hiram, to make any adjustment or arrangement in relation to said farm 1</summary>\n<summary data-order=\"35\" data-type=\"summary\" id=\"b734-5\">The counsel for the complainant objects to the witness answering any inquiries relative to the contents of said letter, without producing; it and the testimony on that subject is taken, subject to that objection.</summary>\n<summary data-order=\"36\" data-type=\"summary\" id=\"b734-6\">The witness says,-\u2014that in said letter Joseph Slocum wrote to his brother Hiram, leaving it optional with said Hiram, either to hold on to the contract or relinquish it, just as he saw fit. That at the time of the above conversation, he understood that said Closson, Mosher, and Hiram Slocum had agreed to meet and make an adjustment relative to said farm, and have no difficulty about it, and that they met at his house for that purpose. That he, the witness, understood that before they left his house they, the said Closson, Mosher, and said Hiram, had settled the controversy, and that said Hiram was to write to his brother to relinquish the contract; but he, the witness, does not know that said Hiram went so far as to say that they had settled the matter; but that he said he would write to his brother to relinquish the contract, and that he was confident that he would do it, from the instructions which he had given him. That said Hiram said that .he had no doubt but that, if his brother had known the circumstances.of the place, and that Mr. Mosher wanted it, he would have had nothing to do with it. That after the said Closson, Mosher, and the said Hiram, had come to the understanding in relation to the farm, which he has mentioned, they separated and left his house ; that he, the witness, -was never present at any other time when Mr. Closson offered <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"719\">*719</page-number>to pay back to said Hiram the hundred dollars which said Joseph had paid him, on account of said farm, as far as he, the witness, recollects. That in the conversation between said Closson, Mosher, and said Hiram, which he, the witness, has stated, he, the said Closson, offered to pay back said hundred dollars to said Hiram, and also pay said Joseph for all the trouble'he had been put to in relation to said farm. That said Closson, in said conversation, also stated, that if he had not supposed that Mr. Mosher did. not want the farm, he should not have contracted with the said Joseph Slocum for the sale of said farm. That he, the witness, has heard said Closson state that he received two letters when he was in St. Louis, one enclosing a deed from himself to said Mosher for said farm, to be by him executed; and also another enclosing to him the sum of'two hundred dollars; in which said last mentioned letter said Mosher requested him to come home, as they could settle their business much better if he was at Schaghticoke, than while he was at St. Louis; and said Closson stated further, that he received both letters the 15th of May, and started for home the 17th of the same May ; that the letter enclosing the deed was from Mr. Pierson, and the letter enclosing the money was from said Mosher; that said Mosher, in his letter, requested him, the said Closson, if he did not come home, to execute the deed; but the witness cannot say whether this conversation took place at the interview he has mentioned between said Closson, Mosher, and said Hiram, or at some time previous ; that he, the witness, understood from said Closson, that on receiving said letters he started for home for the purpose of executing said deed, and closing the business with said Mosher in relation to said farm.</summary>\n<summary data-order=\"37\" data-type=\"summary\" id=\"b735-5\">The counsel for the complainant objected to this testimony of a conversation between the witness and said Closson, which the witness could not say took place at the interview between them, the said Closson, Mosher, and the said Hiram,' before stated.</summary>\n<summary data-order=\"38\" data-type=\"summary\" id=\"b735-6\">That he, the witness, does not recollect that he was ever i present at any other time when said Mosher offered to pay <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"720\">*720</page-number>back to said Hiram Slocum the money his brother Joseph had paid to said Closson, for or on account of said farm; that at the time of the interview before mentioned, William B.

That he, the witness, declined telling said Hiram-where said Closson was, but another person told him that Closson was in the chamber ; whereupon said Hiram asked permission to go into the chamber to see said Closson, to which he, the witness, consented.</summary>\n<summary data-order=\"41\" data-type=\"summary\" id=\"b737-5\"><em>John </em>Wright, being cross-examined, says\u2014that when said Isaac Closson came to his store, as he has stated in his testimony on his direct examination, he,- the witness, thought him to be intoxicated with liquor, and the comrades who came with him were also considerably under the influence of spirituous liquor, and they were very noisy, and, from their appearance and conduct, witness supposed they had set out for a drunken frolic; that said Closson is an intemperate man, and he, the1 witness, does not know that he has ever seen him of late years, when he did not think him under the influence of spirituous liquor; that they were boisterous and noisy after they went up stairs ; that when he, the witness, came into the house from the wood-house, they were still and quiet; that he, the witness, thinks that when said Closson was at his store, as before stated, he was too much intoxicated to be fit to transact any business of importance; that witness did not observe whether he did or did not stagger when he walked.</summary>\n<summary data-order=\"42\" data-type=\"summary\" id=\"b737-6\"><em>William B. </em>Slocum., being sworn,\u2014 The counsel for the defendants objects that his testimony ought not to be taken, on the ground that he is interested in the event of the suit, and for <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"722\">*722</page-number>the validity of this objection relies on the testimony already taken in the cause, as having proved him to be so interested; and also on the ground that the defendants will give further evidence of such interest. The testimony is taken, subject to this objection.</summary>\n<summary data-order=\"43\" data-type=\"summary\" id=\"b738-4\">The witness says,\u2014that he resides in the town of Lansing-burgh, in the county of Rensselaer, and that he is the father of the complainant, and is well acquainted with the defendants in this suit. That he, in the month of June, one thousand eight hundred and thirty-three, went with his wife and daughter to Syracuse, on a visit to his son, Joseph Slocum, the complainant, .and they arrived there about the tenth day of said June. On the morning of his arrival at said Syracuse, early in the morning, before breakfast, he saw Isaac Closson, the defendant, at said Syracuse. That before he saw said Isaac, his son, the said Joseph, had informed him that there was a man there who called himself Isaac Closson, of Schaghticoke ; that afterwards, in the same forenoon, he, the witness, again saw said Closson, and inquired of him where he had been ; lie said he had been rambling at the west, and had not stopped long in any place. He, the witness, then asked him if he was going back to Schaghticoke to remain there ; he said he was going to Schaghticoke to settle his business, but was not going to'remain there. The witness then asked him what he was going to do with his farm; he replied that he was going to sell it. That he, the fitness, then informed him that it was an excellent time to sell it; that land in Schaghticoke was very high, and that there was a great many buyers; that he, the witness, then observed to him that he supposed his brother-in-law, Mr. Mosher, would buy it. Upon which the said Isaac replied, no; that he should not sell it to his brother-in-law Mosher. Thereupon he, the witness, asked said Isaac what price he asked for said farm; to which said Isaac replied that his price was thirty dollars per acre. That he, the witness, then told said Isaac, that if he was determined that Maria, meaning the wife of said Mosher, should not have it, that he wished him to see his, the witness\u2019, son Hiram, as he thought said Hiram, from his owning the farm <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"723\">*723</page-number>adjoining it, would like to buy it; to which the said Isaac replied that he would see said Hiram, for he should like that some of witness\u2019 family should have it, the farm, as they had always been intimate together, and he had rather that they should have it than any one else, provided that they could agree. That the reason of his, the witness\u2019, making this statement to said Isaac was, that his son Hiram had before that time .told him, that if said farm was to be sold, he should like to buy it, and then have all his land together. Witness further observed, to said Isaac, that he did not think his son Hiram would buy it if, in so .doing, he was going to interfere with Mosher and his wife; that he and said Isaac had no further conversation in relation to said farm on that day, as far as he, the witness, recollects; that on the next day afterwards, he, the witness, again saw said Closson, and the witness remarked to him, supposing you and I should make a bargain relative to the farm, in behalf of said Hiram; to which said Isaac made no reply at that time, and he, the witness, asked him no further questions at that time. That he, the witness, again saw the said Isaac afterwards in the same forenoon, when said Isaac told him, the witness, that if Joe, meaning his, the witness\u2019, son Joseph, would buy the farm, that he would sell the same to him; to which he, the witness, replied that he could not tell \"him anything respecting said Joseph buying the farm, and thereupon said Isaac requested him, the witness, to talk with Joseph respecting it; and he, the witness, then told him, the said Isaac, that he would see and talk with said Joseph respecting it, but that he should not see him until noon; and that he, the witness, would let him, the said Isaac, know in the afternoon what said Joseph said, or that he, the said Isaac, might talk with him himself; that at noon, he, the witness, spoke to Joseph respecting the purchase of the farm; and that said Joseph told him that he was going away that afternoon, and could not then attend to doing anything about it, but that he should be back that night: but he, the witness, told said Joseph that he thought that he would not get back that night, as he was going the distance of eighteen miles; that after thus seeing said Joseph, he, the wit<page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"724\">*724</page-number>ness, told said Isaac what his son had said to him, and he further told said Isaac, that his son Joseph told him that he would huy the farm, if they could agree, and would pay him five hundred dollars down, and the remainder the first of September following; that upon his, the witness, so informing said Isaac of what his son said, the said Isaac said that he did not want more than seventy or eighty dollars down, and the remainder on the first of September, when he calculated to go away; that his son Joseph did not get back that night, but returned the next day; that in the forenoon of the said next day, before said Joseph returned, the said Isaac called on him, the witness, several times, and inquired whether said Joseph had returned; that after said Joseph returned, in the forenoon, before dinner, the witness and said Joseph went down to the warehouse of said Joseph and found said Closson there, and said Joseph told said Closson that he would buy his place and give him his price for it, and pay him five hundred dollars down; to which said Isaac replied, that he did not want more than eighty dollars down; and thereupon said Joseph told him that he did not wish to pay him less than one hundred dollars in such a purchase as that was, or words of that import; and that said Joseph also remarked to said Isaac, that he did not wish to interfere with his, said Isaac\u2019s sister and brother-in-law, in making the purchase. To this observation, said Isaac replied, <em>that they should not have it; </em>and thereupon, said Joseph remarked to said Isaac, that either that afternoon or the next day, they would have writings drawn of their bargain; that there was nothing further said in relation to the said farm, at that time, in the hearing of the witness, and soon afterwards they separated ; that afterwards, in the afternoon of the same day, the said Isaac called on the said Joseph, and told him that he wanted to have the writings drawn immediately, as a Mr. Wickes had come on from the west, and was about returning to Schaghticoke, and he, the said Isaac, wanted to go in company with him ; that they, the said Isaac and Joseph, then went away together, in pursuit of some person to draw the writings, but he, the witness, did not go with them. That said Joseph <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"725\">*725</page-number>did not give him, the witness, any authority to buy said farm for him, nor did he, the witness, ever inform said Closson that he, the said Joseph, had given him such authority ; that said Isaac did not ever tell the witness, in conversation at Syracuse, that he had agreed to sell the farm to said Mosher; that he, the witness, did not ever tell said Closson that said Mosher did not want said farm, or anything of that import; nor did he, the witness, ever tell said Closson that he, the said Mosher, was working against him, or calculated to get the farm for little or nothing; that he did not tell said Closson that said Mosher had let the place get down, or out of repair, or anything of that import; that he saw Ashley E. Fish in company with said Closson, at said Syracuse, but did not say anything to said Fish respecting his using his influence with said Closson, to induce him to sell the farm to said Joseph; nor did he, the witness, say anything to said Fish respecting his having influence with said Isaac; that after Closson had left Syracuse some days, witness remarked to Fish, that he supposed he, the said Fish, did not care who had the farm of the said Closson ; to which Fish replied, he did not care who had it, if Mosher did not; that he had rather that any other person should have it than Mosher; that he, the witness, never told Closson, or any other person, that Mosher meant to cheat Closson out of the farm if he could, or words of that import; but that said Fish, in the course of the conversation with Closson, made remarks of that import at several different times; that he, the witness, did not treat said Closson with spirituous liquors while they were at Syracuse, and that he had no recollection of his having ever seen him, the said Closson, drinking spirituous liquors while they were at Syracuse, but once, and then said Fish invited him, the witness, and said Isaac, to drink some spirituous liquors with him, which they did; and that he, the said William, did not say to said Closson that he believed that said Mosher meant to cheat him out of the farm, or anything of that import; that he, the said William B., did not see said Closson, while he was at Syracuse, intoxicated, or so under the influence of spirituous liquor, as in any manner to disqualify him to do business, although he, <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"726\">*726</page-number>the witness, believes that said Isaac was in the habit of drinking more spirituous liquors than was good for him; that said Closson did not inform him, the witness, while he was at Syracuse, that said Mosher had sent out a deed of the farm to him, for him, the said Isaac, to execute ; but after Closson went away from Syracuse, the said Fish so informed him, the witness. The said Isaac and said Joseph concluded the bargain for the farm, some time in the forenoon ; but the writings were drawn in the afternoon.

Are you positive that your son Joseph told Closson that he would not purchase this farm, if it was to interfere with Mosher.</summary>\n<summary data-order=\"129\" data-type=\"summary\" id=\"b746-13\"><em>A. </em>I am positive that said Joseph so told him.</summary>\n<summary data-order=\"130\" data-type=\"summary\" id=\"b746-14\"><em>Hiram, </em>Slocum, <em>being </em>sworn, says,\u2014I live in Troy, and am the brother of complainant.

The complainant went in and inquired for him. From there we went a circuitous rout to Stillwater, in the county of Saratoga; we found him at the village of Still-water, in the chamber of the store of Mr. Wright; he was secreted in that store. When we first went there, he did not come down. The complainant went to the door of the room <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"731\">*731</page-number>where he was, by permission of the owner, and there told him that he had come to have a deed of land that he had purchased from him, executed, and that he had the deed there with him. Mr. Glosson said that he shouldn\u2019t do anything about it. My brother at that time asked Glosson why he conducted in this way 1 Glosson replied, several times, that he didn\u2019t mean to do anything about it; that he didn\u2019t like the survey of the farm. My brother told him that he was willing to pay him fpr all the land there was, and that he wanted the matter arranged amicably and fairly. Glosson pressed out of the room in a good deal of a hurry. My brother took his pocket-bdok out in the presence of Glosson, but did not show him the money. When Glosson pressed out of the room, my brother said to him, stop; that he didn\u2019t wish to do anything wrong about it. Closson went out on to the tow-path, and went out of sight. My. brother had five thousand dollars with him.</summary>\n<summary data-order=\"133\" data-type=\"summary\" id=\"b747-5\">I asked Glosson myself if he hadn\u2019t had notice that they were going to survey the farm ; he told me he had. The farm had been surveyed only a day or two before finding Glosson at Stillwater. It was a farm that belonged to Isaac Glosson and Joseph P. Mosher\u2019s wife, in the town of Schaghticoke. I carried a notice from the complainant to the boarding-house of Glosson, three or four days before this, of the intention to survey the above farm.</summary>\n<summary data-order=\"134\" data-type=\"summary\" id=\"b747-6\">When my brother showed Glosson the pocket-book, on his coming out of the room above mentioned, the pocket-book evidently looked as if it contained money; the bills were sticking out the end of it. This room was in the second story of the store above referred to.</summary>\n<summary data-order=\"135\" data-type=\"summary\" id=\"b747-7\">I meant to be understood as saying that the amount of money my brother had with him was near five thousand dollars; it was certainly over forty-five hundred dollars.</summary>\n<summary data-order=\"136\" data-type=\"summary\" id=\"b747-8\"><em>Cross-examined. </em>At this time the complainant lived at Syracuse, Onondaga county; he had lived there at that time. eight or nine years ; he still continues to live there. I presume he knew that one half of this farm belonged to Joseph P. Mosher, in right of his wife. I do not know what the complainant in<page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"732\">*732</page-number>tended to do with the farm. I don\u2019t know that he contemplated moving back there; I never heard him say that he did.</summary>\n<summary data-order=\"137\" data-type=\"summary\" id=\"b748-4\">At the time I found Closson at Stillwater village, there were three or four of his associates with him. They were in something of a glee. I didn\u2019t discover that Closson, or any one of the company, was intoxicated so as to stagger. I know what is meant by the term high, when speaking of a person in a frolick. I can\u2019t say that Closson was incapable of answering any question put to him correctly. I have no doubt that Closson had been drinking liquor; but I can\u2019t call to my mind any one circumstance, while I was there, that would induce me to think he was excited. There was evidently something in his appearance that showed he had been drinking liquor while there.</summary>\n<summary data-order=\"138\" data-type=\"summary\" id=\"b748-5\">I was at one time present at Mr. Pierson\u2019s office, at an interview between Closson, Joseph P. Mosher, and my brother, the complainant.</summary>\n<summary data-order=\"139\" data-type=\"summary\" id=\"ARl\">I saw the money that the complainant had before I saw Closson at Wright\u2019s store. I don\u2019t know as I counted it. I saw money in the pocket-book of the complainant in the morning of the day when we found Closson. 1 don\u2019t recollect of seeing the deed before complainant took it out in the above mentioned store of Wright. I saw a paper which complainant took out there, but didn\u2019t read the deed. I read the deed before this, and after, both. I have had the deed in my hands. This paper which complainant had at Wright\u2019s, I suppose to be the same paper.</summary>\n<summary data-order=\"140\" data-type=\"summary\" id=\"b748-7\">The following depositions were taken on the part of the defendants :\u2014</summary>\n<summary data-order=\"141\" data-type=\"summary\" id=\"b748-8\">On this 8th day of September, 1834, personally appeared before me, John E. Lovett, examiner in chancery, <em>Ashley E. Fish, </em>a witness produced on the part of the defendants, who, being duly affirmed, and orally examined by the counsel for said defendants, says,\u2014that he resides at Syracuse, in the county of Onondaga. Knows the parties complainant and defendants, and also knows William B. Slocum and Hiram Slocum : William B. Slocum is the father of Hiram and Joseph <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"733\">*733</page-number>Slocum. William B. Slocum used to reside in Schaghticoke, opposite to where Joseph P. Mosher now lives; Hiram and Joseph Slocum formerly lived with their father.</summary>\n<summary data-order=\"142\" data-type=\"summary\" id=\"b749-5\">I am acquainted with the farm now in dispute, called the Closson farm. Joseph P. Mosher, one of the defendants, married a sister of Isaac Closson; as nigh as I can recollect, it is twelve years since he married her; I cannot tell exactly. Isaac Closson and Mrs. Mosher were the only heirs of Robert Closson.</summary>\n<summary data-order=\"143\" data-type=\"summary\" id=\"b749-6\">I think that Robert Closson died in the year 1814.</summary>\n<summary data-order=\"144\" data-type=\"summary\" id=\"b749-7\">I think it was in the fall of 1827, that Isaac Closson first left here to go into the western country.</summary>\n<summary data-order=\"145\" data-type=\"summary\" id=\"b749-8\">In the season of 1827, I lived with Joseph P. Mosher; and there were frequent conversations between Isaac Closson and Joseph P. Mosher, about the purchase of the said farm by Mosher, from Closson; Closson stated that he had rather that Mosher should have it than any body else, as he had married his sister and owned the other half of the farm, and it was the choice of the sister to retain said farm.</summary>\n<summary data-order=\"146\" data-type=\"summary\" id=\"b749-9\">The counsel for the complainant objects to any parol testimony, as to the sale or transfer of the farm.</summary>\n<summary data-order=\"147\" data-type=\"summary\" id=\"b749-10\">I heard Closson say to Mosher, that if he would give him as much for his part, of the farm a:s any body else, that he had rather that he should have it, on account of his sister\u2014that is, if he sold it.</summary>\n<summary data-order=\"148\" data-type=\"summary\" id=\"b749-11\">I saw Isaac Gloss,on at Syracuse, on his return from the west; it was some time in June, 1833.</summary>\n<summary data-order=\"149\" data-type=\"summary\" id=\"b749-12\">I saw William B. Slocum there at the same time; Joseph Slocum lives there, and did live there at that time.</summary>\n<summary data-order=\"150\" data-type=\"summary\" id=\"b749-13\">I think that William B. Slocum told me that he was there on a visit to his son Joseph; he said that he stopped at his son Joseph\u2019s house.</summary>\n<summary data-order=\"151\" data-type=\"summary\" id=\"b749-14\">I heard a conversation between William B. Slocum and Isaac Closson, at Syracuse,, at the time aforesaid, in which conversation William B. Slocum wanted to purchase said Isaac\u2019s part of said farm.</summary>\n<summary data-order=\"152\" data-type=\"summary\" id=\"b749-15\">He said that he was authorized by Joseph Slocum, to pur<page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"734\">*734</page-number>chase the interest of Isaac Closson in said farm, for Joseph and Hiram Slocum, if they could agree upon a price. Isaac Closson told Mr. Slocum that he had been gone a good while, and he did not know how the property then stood ; but, that if Joseph Mosher did not want it, that he had as leave sell to the Slocums as any body else.</summary>\n<summary data-order=\"153\" data-type=\"summary\" id=\"b750-4\">Q. Do you recollect whether Isaac Closson told William B. Slocum that he, Closson, had agreed to sell his interest in said farm to Joseph P. Mosher, and that Mosher had sent a deed out to him, Closson, to be executed and sent back ?</summary>\n<summary data-order=\"154\" data-type=\"summary\" id=\"b750-5\">Question objected to by complainant\u2019s counsel; answer taken, subject to the objection.</summary>\n<summary data-order=\"155\" data-type=\"summary\" id=\"b750-6\"><em>A. </em>Yes.</summary>\n<summary data-order=\"156\" data-type=\"summary\" id=\"b750-7\">Q. Did Isaac Closson show the deed to you that had been - sent out to him?</summary>\n<summary data-order=\"157\" data-type=\"summary\" id=\"b750-8\"><em>A. </em>Isaac Closson showed me the deed that had been sent out to him. I don\u2019t recollect that William B. Slocum was'\"by when the deed was shown to me; William B. Slocum told Isaac Closson, that Mosher did not want the place ; that he, Mosher, had been working against him, Closson, and calculated to get the place for little or nothing.</summary>\n<summary data-order=\"158\" data-type=\"summary\" id=\"b750-9\">Slocum said that Mosher had let the place go down, and get out of repair. Slocum called upon me the same day, and said to me, \u201c You and Mr. Closson have been brought up together, and your influence will go further with him than any other person ;\u201d and he wished me to use my influence in their behalf in purchasing the farm.</summary>\n<summary data-order=\"159\" data-type=\"summary\" id=\"b750-10\">I told Mr. Closson that Hiram and the family of Slocums had always been neighbors of his, and their farms joined each other, and if they would give as much for it as any body else,</summary>\n<summary data-order=\"160\" data-type=\"summary\" id=\"b750-11\">I would let them have it, providing that Mosher did \u25a0 not want it.</summary>\n<summary data-order=\"161\" data-type=\"summary\" id=\"b750-12\">Slocum said that Joseph Mosher meant to cheat Isaac out of the farm, if he could, as he believed.</summary>\n<summary data-order=\"162\" data-type=\"summary\" id=\"b750-13\">I saw William B. Slocum treat Isaac Closson two or three times with brandy during his stay at Syracuse.</summary>\n<summary data-order=\"163\" data-type=\"summary\" id=\"b750-14\">I should not think that Isaac Closson was in a suitable situ<page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"735\">*735</page-number>ation to transact business in consequence of drinking; since he went out west, he has got to be very much addicted to drinking; he had altered so much that I hardly knew him.</summary>\n<summary data-order=\"164\" data-type=\"summary\" id=\"b751-5\">Joseph Slocum was not present at any of the conversations between Isaac and me, or between his father and me. I saw Closson standing in Joseph Slocum\u2019s store door several times.</summary>\n<summary data-order=\"165\" data-type=\"summary\" id=\"b751-6\">I was in the next store, and Closson was in and out frequently at Joseph\u2019s store and the store where I was. I think Joseph Slocum did not keep liquors to sell in his store; his is a forwarding store. I should think that Closson remained at Syracuse three or four days. I did not see him at any time, while there, when he was not the worse for liquor.</summary>\n<summary data-order=\"166\" data-type=\"summary\" id=\"b751-7\">Q. Do you recollect whether Closson, in the conversation between him and William B. Slocum, said that Mosher had sent money out to him at the west on account of the farm1?</summary>\n<summary data-order=\"167\" data-type=\"summary\" id=\"b751-8\">Question objected to by complainant\u2019s counsel.</summary>\n<summary data-order=\"168\" data-type=\"summary\" id=\"b751-9\">Answer taken, subject to the objection.</summary>\n<summary data-order=\"169\" data-type=\"summary\" id=\"b751-10\"><em>A. </em>Yes.</summary>\n<summary data-order=\"170\" data-type=\"summary\" id=\"b751-11\">Q. What did he say <em>1</em></summary>\n<summary data-order=\"171\" data-type=\"summary\" id=\"b751-12\"><em>A. </em>Closson observed that he nad received the deed, and that money was sent in a letter directed to St. Louis. I think it was five hundred dollars.</summary>\n<summary data-order=\"172\" data-type=\"summary\" id=\"b751-13\">And being <em>cross-examined </em>by the counsel for the complainant, deponent says: The first conversation I heard between William B. Slocum and Isaac Closson, at Syracuse, was when they met and were talking about the farm. I think Mr. Slocum asked him if he had disposed of his farm, and he said \u201cno.\u201d Slocum then remarked that he should like to purchase it for Hiram and Joseph if they could agree, or words to that import. Isaac then stated that Joseph P. Mosher had sent out a deed and a letter with money in it to St. Louis, and that he then had the deed in a valise or trunk. Mr. Slocum remarked that Mr. Mosher did not wish to purchase the place; that he, Mosher, had worked against him, Closson, as he thought, while he was gone, and meant to get the place for little or nothing; he said he should like to buy the place for them, as it adjoined <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"736\">*736</page-number>their farm ; should j,ike to buy, if they could agree upon a price.</summary>\n<summary data-order=\"173\" data-type=\"summary\" id=\"b752-4\">Mr. Closson remarked, that if Mr. Mosher did not wish to buy the farm, that he had as leave sell to them as to a stranger, or to anybody else, if they would pay as much as anybody else. I don\u2019t recollect particularly of anything more said at the first interview. I think this conversation was the second day after Closson arrived at Syracuse; they had seen each other before this conversation; I think they had seen each other the day before, and I think I was present \"when they first met. Closson was in the store where I was, and Mr. Slocum was passing by, and I spoke to him, and asked him \u201c Do you know this young man\u00ed\u201d</summary>\n<summary data-order=\"174\" data-type=\"summary\" id=\"b752-5\">This conversation, that I have been speaking of in my cross-examination, was in the store.</summary>\n<summary data-order=\"175\" data-type=\"summary\" id=\"b752-6\">Mr. Slocum arrived in Syracuse on the day that I asked him the question as above stated, as Slocum informed me.

The reason is, after I requested you to send me $200, I had some business with Mr. Jackson, who was running a boat up to the mines and to Prairie du Chein, up the Mississippi, and went up with him ; I directed Mr. Steritt, in St. Louis, to take out your letter and keep it until I returned; after I got to Prairie du Chein, I was taken with the ague, which lasted about three weeks before it could be stopped; I then returned to Galena; I there was taken with the fever and some chills, and had to stay there for two months before I could start down; and after starting, I did not .get down further than the Rapids, and lay there for some time; after gaining strength to go, I started on a keel boat, there being no steamboat running, the river was so low. By exposing myself in the winter, I was taken worse, but still kept on the boat until I got to St. Louis ; when I got there, I found that Mr. Steritt had gone to the mountains; I went to the post-office and inquired for letters for myself; they told me there were letters for a person of that name, but was forbid letting them go unless positive proof of my name. This was in October ; I was yet unwell. Some of my particular friends were living about six miles from St. Louis; I got in a boat and went up; my sickness kept on. About the first of November, Mr. Steritt came down from the mountains, took out the letters and fetched up tome; I grew worse from that time until Doctor Campbell gave me up for gone ; other doctors from St. Louis was employed, but thought there was no chance for my recovery; they could not tell my complaint, and did nothing but pour calomel into me, until they had got about 260 grains into me at one time without operation. About this time, the fever fell into my head and set me crazy ; I remained so for some time; after I began to recover, I was recommended to <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"749\">*749</page-number>go into the woods, where I would be out of the noise. I started up the river, and encamped about the Illinois river; was there taken sick again, suffered much; when I began to recover, I gained fast, and am at this present time well; I could not send to an office on account of snow, which is deep; I waited for ..a break of the winter to come down; being anxious to write, I broke my road through the snow. You reminded me of your power of attorney was out, but sickness prevented me from renewing it; you told me that you would buy the farm; I want to sell, for I am broke ; my sickness expenses have.cost me everything and more; I must have suffered if you had not have sent me the $200 that I requested; I want you to send me $200 more, if it be in your power, and tell me what you will give for my part of the farm, and how you will make payments. I have pitched upon a place about the rapids of the Illinois, to spend the- remainder of my days; I am tired of travelling.

Mosher.</summary>\n<summary data-order=\"282\" data-type=\"summary\" id=\"b767-7\">The depositions of the witnesses for the respective parties having been taken, an order was entered with the register of the court of chancery, on the 23d day of November, 1837, closing the proofs; and on the 18th day of December following, an order was entered, referring the cause to the vice-chancellor of the fourth circuit for a hearing.</summary>\n<summary data-order=\"283\" data-type=\"summary\" id=\"b767-8\">On the 26th day of July, 1838, a hearing was had before Hon. John D. Willard, vice-chancellor of the fourth circuit; who afterwards, on the 18th day of August following, delivered the following opinion:\u2014</summary>\n<summary data-order=\"284\" data-type=\"summary\" id=\"b767-9\">If Joseph P. Mosher purchased the premises of Isaac Closson subsequent to the contract entered into between the complainant and the said Isaac, and with notice of said contract, and not in pursuance of an agreement made between him and the said Isaac of an earlier period, he is a proper party to this bill; and all other things being established, his deed is liable to be set aside in order that a specific performance may be decreed of the agreement between complainant and Closson. <em>(See </em>5 <em>J. Ch. JR. </em>231.)</summary>\n<summary data-order=\"285\" data-type=\"summary\" id=\"b767-10\">That every individual should fulfill his contract, so long as the power to do so remains with him, must be admitted to be <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"752\">*752</page-number>a moral obligation. According to the established forms of the common law, there was no remedy afforded in case of a breach of contract, except in the nature of pecuniary damage for the wrong sustained. This mode of redress was at an early period of the law found to be defective, and in many cases wholly inadequate ; hence the court of chancery, possessing more complete control over parties, and moulding its decrees to the particular circumstances before it, acquired, at an early day, jurisdiction of this class of cases, and afforded relief in cases where the common law failed.</summary>\n<summary data-order=\"286\" data-type=\"summary\" id=\"b768-5\">But to induce this court to interfere, two things must be made out on the part of the complainant. 1st. That the legal remedy is inadequate, and that without a specific performance injustice would be done, or irreparable injury produced : And, 2d. That the contract is fair, just, and reasonable, equal in all its parts, founded on an adequate consideration, and free from fraud, misrepresentation, or surprise. As 'the remedy for a breach of a contract is, under ordinary circumstances, confessedly at law, the party who seeks to invoke the aid of a court of equity, holds the affirmative, and must make out a case entitling him to the relief sought. It is not enough, to entitle him to a decree, to prove, as in a court of law, the execution of the instrument. The form of the bill, as well as the ordinary course of the court in this class of cases, imposes on, the complainant a greater burden.</summary>\n<summary data-order=\"287\" data-type=\"summary\" id=\"b768-6\">It will not be necessary, to a correct decision of this cause, to review all the cases which have been cited. The general principles, applicable to the present remedy, are correctly stated in the last edition of <em>Fonb. Eq. </em>45 <em>to </em>48, <em>and notes, and </em>281, <em>et seq. </em>2 <em>Story Equity, title Specific Performance. </em>The doctrine, too, was correctly stated by chancellor Kent, in Seymour v. <em>Delaney, </em>(6 <em>J. Ch. R. </em>222,) and by chief justice Savage, on delivering his opinion in the same case in the court of errors, (3 <em>Cowen, </em>445.) Although the decree of chancellor Kent was reversed by the court of errors, and although chief justice Savage was in the minority in that court, it is obvious that the reversal was occasioned by a difference of opinion as <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"753\">*753</page-number>to the facts proved in the case. Suydam, senator, delivered the prevailing opinion, and it will he seen, by an examination of it in 3 <em>Cowen, page </em>530 <em>and </em>531, that, in his judgment, the facts did not sustain the opinion of the chancellor and chief justice. There is nothing else in his opinion that can in the least shake the legal positions of those distinguished jurists. They are as much entitled to our respect, as authority, as if the decree had been affirmed.</summary>\n<summary data-order=\"288\" data-type=\"summary\" id=\"b769-5\">The case of <em>Seymour </em>v. <em>Delaney </em>turned mainly on the question whether there was such inadequacy of consideration, as to induce a court of equity to refuse to carry it into effect. The chi.ncellor and chief justice were of that opinion. It was agreed on all hands that there is a distinction between the exercise of the power of the court in setting aside agreements for fraud, inadequacy, and the like, and in decreeing their specific execution. It was conceded that the court might lawfully <em>refuse </em>to compel a specific performance of an agreement which it could not <em>set </em>aside, and against which it could not relieve, if it was once executed by the parties.</summary>\n<summary data-order=\"289\" data-type=\"summary\" id=\"b769-6\">The reason for this diversity may in part be found in the fact, that an application for a specific performance of an agreement, is addressed to the sound discretion of the court, and is not to be exercised when the plaintiff has so conducted as to forfeit hiso claim to its interposition. These are well established principles.</summary>\n<summary data-order=\"290\" data-type=\"summary\" id=\"b769-7\">It is important, then, to consider whether the plaintiff\u2019s conduct in the present case commends his cause to the favorable notice of the court.</summary>\n<summary data-order=\"291\" data-type=\"summary\" id=\"b769-8\">It is alleged that William B. Slocum, who acted as the plaintiff\u2019s agent in procuring the contract in question, assisted in getting the defendant, Closson, intoxicated, and that he made false statements to him, having a material influence on his mind, and which probably induced the contract.</summary>\n<summary data-order=\"292\" data-type=\"summary\" id=\"b769-9\">It is evident that Closson was addicted to the excessive use of ardent spirits; that this was known to plaintiff and William B. Slocum; that Closson had before this made up his mind to sell the premises to his brother-in-law, the other defendant; <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"754\">*754</page-number>that a part of the consideration was advanced by the latter to Closson, and that these facts were known to William B. Slocum at the time he made the bargain. It is probable, also, that Slocum induced Closson to believe that his brother-in-law, Mosher, did not want the place ; that he had treated him unfairly, by letting it go to ruin with a view to get it'for nothing; that Mosher wanted to cheat Closson out of the place; and that he then excited a hostile spirit in the bosom of Closson towards his brother-in-law. These facts are all proved by one witness positively; and some positions of the most material parts of this testimony, are strongly corroborated by other witnesses. I shall therefore assume that the facts rare true. On the score of credibility, Fish is to be preferred to Wm. B. Slocum.</summary>\n<summary data-order=\"293\" data-type=\"summary\" id=\"b770-5\">It remains to consider what effect these facts ought to have on the agreement in question. That the representations made by Wm. B. Slocum, as to Mosher, were entirely false; and that they were the means by which he induced Closson to change his mind and to sell the place to the plaintiff, after it had been made up to convey to Mosher, I have no doubt. In <em>Livingston </em>v. <em>The Peru Iron Company, </em>(2 <em>Paige, </em>390,) the chancellor decided that a purchase would be set aside, obtained by a representation that the land was good for nothing but a sheep pasture, when the purchaser knew it contained a valuable iron mine. In the discussions of that case, the chancellor was led to remark on the difference between an application to set aside a conveyance already made on the ground of fraud, and a bill to enforce specifically an agreement obtained by the same fraud. And he observes that he was not aware of any case in this country, in which an agreement was <em>set aside </em>on a mere suppression by the buyer of a fact materially enhancing the value of the property ; but he observes, the court will not enforce the specific performance of the contract, if the complainant has intentionally concealed a material fact from the adverse party, the disclosure of which would have prevented the making of the agreement. The assertion of a falsehood is equivalent to the concealment of a fact. If the falsehood asserted be of a matter sufficiently important to induce the,s making of a contract, it is enough to <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"755\">*755</page-number>prevent the aid of this court to enforce it. The parties must be left, to their remedies at law;\u2014this court will not countenance falsehood or fraud, nor aid a liar in his wicked design.</summary>\n<summary data-order=\"294\" data-type=\"summary\" id=\"b771-5\">Nor should it be forgotten, that Closson was a man of intemperate habits. Although the defendants have failed to show that he was intoxicated when'the contract was made, it is nevertheless evident that a man of such habits would be more accessible to impositions, and his temper more easily excited, than a man of sobriety. The assertions made by Wm. B. Slocum, as to the conduct of Mosher, were calculated to have a controlling influence on the mind of Closson. In short, they induced him to make the contract. Those assertions were false. No attempt has been made to prove that they were true.</summary>\n<summary data-order=\"295\" data-type=\"summary\" id=\"b771-6\">If it be said that the morality of trade will justify a departure from truth, and that each party deals with the other at arms\u2019 length, it may be answered that such considerations are applicable only to proceedings in a court of law, which disregards any unfairness, inadequacy of price, or misrepresentation, unless of so gross a character as to amount to actual fraud. A court \u00f3f equity holds to a pure system of ethics. It withholds its aid from the party who seeks to enforce an unfair or unconscionable bargain; and lends it only to prevent the other party from practicing a fraud. The party who calls for its cooperation, must show himself entitled to it by the honesty and integrity of his conduct. If the contract has been obtained by misrepresentations, a court of equity leaves the parties to their legal remedies.</summary>\n<summary data-order=\"296\" data-type=\"summary\" id=\"b771-7\">With regard to the defendant, Mosher, the bill should doubtless be dismissed with costs.</summary>\n<summary data-order=\"297\" data-type=\"summary\" id=\"b771-8\">In making jhe purchase of the farm in question, he merely consummated a bargain which he had commenced negotiating before the plaintiff made any proposition to buy. It is unnecessary to. affirm that the bargain between him and Closson had been so far completed when the contract between Closson and plaintiff was entered into, as to entitle him to the aid of this court to enforce its specific execution. The bargain between <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"756\">*756</page-number>Mosher and Closson was broken off by the misrepresentation of the plaintiff or his agent. It was natural that Closson, when he found he had been imposed upon by the plaintiff, should refuse to carry the contract into effect, and should fulfill his original design. The plaintiff foresaw that such would be the case, and hence the anxiety of Wm. B. Slocum to have the contract reduced to writing before Closson could see Mosher. The complainant, in fact, has no equity against either defendant, and the bill must be dismissed as to both, with costs.</summary>\n<summary data-order=\"298\" data-type=\"summary\" id=\"b772-4\">A decree was, on the 18th Sept., 1838, accordingly entered, dismissing the bill, with costs as to both defendants.</summary>\n<summary data-order=\"299\" data-type=\"summary\" id=\"b772-5\">From the whole of this decree the complainant appealed to the chancellor, which appeal was brought to a hearing on the 26th day of August, 1840, and the chancellor afterwards, and on the seventh day of March, 1848, delivered the following opinion:\u2014</summary>\n<attorneys data-order=\"300\" data-type=\"attorneys\" id=\"b772-8\"><em>David L. </em>Seymour, <em>attorney and </em>counsel, and</attorneys>\n<attorneys data-order=\"301\" data-type=\"attorneys\" id=\"b772-9\"><em>Joshua A. </em>Spencer, <em>counsel </em>for appellant.</attorneys>\n<p data-order=\"302\" data-type=\"legal\" id=\"b772-10\"><em>First. </em>There is no proof of a prior valid contract between <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"757\">*757</page-number>Isaac Closson and Joseph P.

But if the complainant has any claims whatever against the defendant Closson, he should be left to his remedy at law. The decision of the vice-chancellor was, therefore, right in this case; and the decree appealed from must be affirmed with costs.</p>\n<p id=\"b772-7\">From the decree of the chancellor, affirming the decree of the vice-chancellor, the complainant, Slocum, appealed to the court of errors.
