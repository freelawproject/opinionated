By a strict construction of the will, the widow was entitled to the use and income of the whole estate, real and personal,, so long as she remained his widow. She remained his widow until she died, June 10th, 1834. Der fendant submits to the court, whether, under the circumstances, the personal property belonged to the children as distributees ; but is advised said personal property, in equity, does not belong to the children, as heirs at law. The legacies were payable out of the personal property, and the executors could not be compelled to pay them till the widow\u2019s death.</summary>\n<summary data-order=\"30\" data-type=\"summary\" id=\"b290-7\">Bill.\u2014That Jane Van Hoesen died in July, 1838.

The other children did much less, and defendant ought to have had a larger portion. At testator\u2019s death, George <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"275\">*275</page-number>Van Hoesen was about sixteen years old. Neither he nor defendant had any property of any consequence. Defendant is advised, and believes, that by the will, the widow had the exclusive right to the use of all the estate until her death or re-marriage. She was a healthy woman, about forty-eight years of age. <em>(Fol. </em>18, 21.)</summary>\n<summary data-order=\"39\" data-type=\"summary\" id=\"b291-7\">Bill.\u2014That shortly after testator\u2019s death, John M. collected the debts, &amp;c., or sold them,, or turned them out in payment of demands against him. Believe he delivered a part of them to Lambert, in payment of his legacy of $3,000, about the time said legacy became due. The whole of said legacy was paid out of testator\u2019s personal estate, and that the widow never, had or received any portion of the income of said personal property, but, that John M. applied the entire proceeds thereof to his own use.</summary>\n<summary data-order=\"40\" data-type=\"summary\" id=\"b291-8\">Answer.\u2014That testator fell sick on Monday, was considered dangerously ill Tuesday, and died Wednesday afternoon. Nicholas Kittle, an ignorant and unskilled man in such matters, was called on to draw the will, a few hours before testator died, and when he was too weak to ascertain whether it conformed to his directions or not. Defendant understood from his mother that testator directed Kittle to draw the will so as to give the farm, &amp;c., to defendant and George, subject to a life estate to the widow, and the legacies to be paid out of the personal property\u2014it not being so drawn was through Kittle\u2019s ignorance. Defendant submits that such should be the construction. <em>(Fol. </em>21,25.) It was well understood that he meant to give the farm to John and George, and the money to Lambert and the girls. <em>(Fol. </em>25, 26.)</summary>\n<summary data-order=\"41\" data-type=\"summary\" id=\"b291-9\">Bill.\u2014The legacies to the daughters were also paid by John M. out of the avails of testator\u2019s personal estate, although a charge upon him and his brother George personally. <em>(Fol. </em>16.)</summary>\n<summary data-order=\"42\" data-type=\"summary\" id=\"b291-10\">Answer.\u2014Admitted. <em>(Fol. </em>49, 50.)</summary>\n<summary data-order=\"43\" data-type=\"summary\" id=\"b291-11\">Bill.\u2014Dorothy Van Hoesen, the widow, was entitled to the use of all the personal property during her life. The income of the real estate was more than sufficient to support the widow. .John M. did not deliver the goods, credits, &amp;c., to the widow, <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"276\">*276</page-number>but shortly after her death disposed of them, or appropriated them to his own use. <em>(Fol. </em>17, 18.)</summary>\n<summary data-order=\"44\" data-type=\"summary\" id=\"b292-4\">Answer.\u2014Admits that defendant did not deliver to the widow the goods, chattels, &amp;c., but retained the same to pay the legacies and claims, debts and funeral expenses of testator, upon an agreement made with the widow. <em>(Fol. </em>49, 50.) Defendant cannot state with accuracy whether the use and income of real estate were more than sufficient to support the widow and her minor children,, whom she supported ; but to the best of knowledge and belief, were not more than sufficient to support said widow and her children. comfortably, as supported by defendant. <em>(Fol. </em>51, 52.)</summary>\n<summary data-order=\"45\" data-type=\"summary\" id=\"b292-5\">That shortly after death of testator, defendant made an agreement with the widow, by which he took possession of the farm, together with the stock, farming utensils and other goods, and' chattels undisposed of, as before mentioned, and used, occupied and enjoyed the same for his own benefit and that of his brother George, until 1825, when defendant bought George out; and as a compensation to the- widow therefor, supported and maintained her during her life with every necessary and eomfprt, and provided for her minor children during their minority, and, as he believes, to the widow\u2019s entire satisfaction. <em>(Fol. </em>52, 53.) That he paid for her physician\u2019s bills to an amount not less than $639, she having within a few years after testator\u2019s death become infirm and afflicted with frequent illness. That he permitted the widow to use the dwelling-house of which testator died seized, to receive and entertain her friends, with entire freedom and uncontrol, as if she had been sole owner of said real estate, goods, <em>See. </em>And that defendant being unmarried, boarded and resided with her as a member of the family. <em>(Fol. </em>54, 55.)</summary>\n<summary data-order=\"46\" data-type=\"summary\" id=\"b292-6\">Bill.\u2014After the marriage of Hoes with Mary, and before the death of the widow, from ten to eighteen years ago, defendant paid to Hoes and wife $700, with interest, in satisfaction of Mary\u2019s legacy, for which a receipt was given by Hoes and wife, or one of them. No more than was due upon the legacy was paid when the receipt was given. Intended to give a receipt foi; the legacy, and nothing more. They understand defendant <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"277\">*277</page-number>pretends said receipt cuts off complainants\u2019 claim to any share of testator\u2019s personal estate. If said receipt purports to cover anything but the legacy, it is false and fraudulent, and should be no bar in pquity. <em>(Fol. </em>18,19, 20, 21, 22.)</summary>\n<summary data-order=\"47\" data-type=\"summary\" id=\"b293-5\">Answer.\u2014That defendant paid said legacy of $700 to Maria, who was then twenty-four years of age, and unmarried, and who agreed to receive the same, and executed to defendant and his brother George, and the executors, a full release of all claims upon real and personal estate of the testator; said release dated Dec. 26,1818, and is contained in schedule C, <em>(Fol. </em>38,39, 40;) that defendant gave her his note for $700, and paid same to Hoes after his marriage, except a small portion, which he paid to her, <em>(Fol. </em>40 ;) denies that release was fraudulent, &amp;c., <em>(Fol. </em>37,).and insists that same is binding. <em>(Fol. </em>55.)</summary>\n<summary data-order=\"48\" data-type=\"summary\" id=\"b293-6\">Bill.\u2014Hoes and wife had never seen the will when the receipt was executed. The will was in possession of defendant, who knew the contents and legal effect thereof; and that Hoes and wife, after the widow\u2019s death, would be entitled to one-sixth of the personal estate of the testator. Complainants believe defendant had been so advised, and knew or suspected complainants were^ ignorant of it; believe that if said receipt \u2019 covers anything but the legacy, defendant prepared the same with the knowledge that complainants would be entitled to a share of the personal estate, after death of the widow, and supposing complainants to be ignorant that such was the legal effect of the will. <em>(Fol. </em>23, 24, 25, 26.)</summary>\n<summary data-order=\"49\" data-type=\"summary\" id=\"b293-7\">Answer.\u2014That the will was opened six weeks after testator\u2019s death, and read in presence of all the family, audibly. In March after, proved and recorded, and will returned to defendant. Denies positively, that he has ever misrepresented contents, or done anything to prevent or divert complainants from going to the record to see contents, or that he has ever declined giving them free access to the original. Admits he became acquainted with contents when will was opened and read, but did not, nor does he now know, what would be the legal construction. Denies that he suspected they were ignorant of the contents when the releases were executed. <em>(Fol. </em>26,31.) Vanderpoel and others advised him, as friends, that will did not <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"278\">*278</page-number>clearly express testator\u2019s intention; there might be trouble, and advised him to get a release. <em>(Fol. </em>31, 33.) Denies he supposed they would hold the personal property after widow\u2019s death, except what he derived from the advice of Vanderpoel and others. Admits complainants did not, probably, know of such advice, and that, probably, they did not know whether they would be entitled to a distribution after widow\u2019s death or not; but has no doubt they knew what had been the intention of the testator ; and that they were then willing to carry it into effect; and that they executed th\u00e9 releases with a full knowledge of their contents for that purpose.. <em>(Fol. </em>33, 36.) Expressly denies any art, stratagem, or device, or misrepresentation or fraud, but says, mutual liberality and good feeling induced the widow to relinquish, and the settlement to take plape. <em>(Fol. </em>36,41.) Releases were executed, with full knowledge of their contents, and of their rights, or with means of knowing their rights, and without fraud or misrepresentation on his part. \u2022 <em>(Fol. </em>42, 45.)

They are not payable by the executors, but by the devisees personally, and evidently on account of the devise of the real estate.</p>\n<p data-order=\"71\" data-type=\"legal\" id=\"b296-9\">Although the personal estate is generally the primary fund for the payment of legacies, as well as of debts, yet if there be an express direction, that they be otherwise paid, or' if from the scope and tenor of the will the testator\u2019s intent may be fairly inferred to be otherwise, then such intent will prevail, and the testator\u2019s personal estate be exonerated.</p>\n<p data-order=\"72\" data-type=\"legal\" id=\"b296-10\">Again, assuming that the legacies are to be paid out of the personal property, the chancellor, instead of dismissing the bill, should have directed an account of the personal property to be taken, to ascertain whether the debts and legacies would exhaust it. <em>(Kelsey </em>v. <em>Deyo, </em>3 <em>Cow.

They were intended to cover nothing more, and it would, therefore be inequitable and unjust to give them ajnore comprehensive operation. If Van Hoesen designed to embrace in them something more, it was an unconscientious and fraudulent act on his part, which should not be permitted to prevail.</p>\n<p data-order=\"75\" data-type=\"legal\" id=\"b297-7\">The release of Hager was inoperative and void as to any thing beyond the $700, as he could not discharge any thing belonging to his wife, beyond a vested interest in possession. This was not such an interest. <em>(Jackson </em>v. Stackhouse, 1 <em>Cow. </em>126 ; <em>McIntyre </em>v. Clark, 1 <em>Edw. Ch.
