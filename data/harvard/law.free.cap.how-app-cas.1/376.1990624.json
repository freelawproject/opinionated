Demand of payment and notice of non-payment, are distinct and different acts from that of protest, and in cases where it is not necessary to protest, a demand must be made and notice of non-payment given; and when a protest is necessary, notice must also, <em>that is in addition </em>to the protest, be given to the endorser. (3 <em>Kent, </em>93, 4, <em>4th ed.)</em></p>\n<p data-order=\"97\" data-type=\"legal\" id=\"b403-13\">Protest is the official act of a notary, and although usual, is not necessary in the case of an inland bill.

It is neither notice, nor evidence that notice has been given to the endorser. <em>(Fitter </em>v. <em>Morris, </em>6 <em>Wharton, </em>406, 415; <em>Bank of Rochester </em>v. <em>Gray, </em>2 <em>Hill, </em>231, 227. \u00aeS\u00a7\u201c <em>Story Bills, </em>302, <em>note </em>2, 311,346, 360; <em>do. from notes, </em>346, 315; 6 <em>Wheat. </em>572 <em>in point; 4 Cranch, </em>141; 5 <em>Leigh, </em>529; 17 <em>Wend. </em>99; 4 <em>Hill, </em>420; 7 <em>Wend. </em>165; 9 <em>Wend. </em>121. <em>\"G&amp;M)</em></p>\n<p data-order=\"99\" data-type=\"legal\" id=\"b403-15\">It is no part of the duty of a notary to give this notice. <em>(Morgan </em>v. <em>Van Ingen, </em>2 <em>Johns.

A protest being an act of a public officer, after demand, <em>{Jacob\u2019s Law Dictionary, 330\u2014title, Bills of Exchange, </em>4,) and before notice, and being neither a demand or notice, a waiver of the protest, (especially of an inland bill,) is neither a waiver of demand or notice. <em>(Chitty on Bills, pp. </em>362, 3, <em>ed. of </em>1836; <em>Leftly </em>v. <em>Mills, </em>4 <em>T.

The assignment was not to the defendant, but to one of the plaintiffs; it gave the defendant no control of the property.</p>\n<p data-order=\"107\" data-type=\"legal\" id=\"b404-10\">2.

It follows, therefore, that the plaintiffs are in fact the persons who are preferred, to the amount of this note, in the assignment of the maker.</p>\n<p data-order=\"110\" data-type=\"legal\" id=\"b404-13\"><em>Third. </em>The written instrument, signed by the plaintiffs and others, dated 8th February, 1840, was a valid release and dis<page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"389\">*389</page-number>charge by the plaintiffs of the maker of said note, from all liability thereon, and the endorser was also thereby discharged. (6 <em>P. </em>416; 8 P. 236.)</p>\n<p data-order=\"111\" data-type=\"legal\" id=\"b405-5\">1. The assignment by the maker of all his property, for the payment of the plaintiffs and others, and the new written agreement by the maker, to pay the plaintiffs in seven years whatever balance there might be, after applying the asssigned property towards the payment of these demands, was a sufficient consideration to support the release. <em>(Heathcote </em>v. <em>Crook</em>shanks, 2 <em>T. R. </em>27, 8; <em>pr. </em>Buller, J.)</p>\n<p data-order=\"112\" data-type=\"legal\" id=\"b405-6\">2. The execution of it by one of the plaintiffs, in the name of the firm, was sufficient. <em>(Pierson </em>v. Hooker, 3 <em>Johns. Rep. </em>68; <em>Bulkley </em>v. Dayton, 14 <em>do. do. </em>387; <em>Austin </em>v. <em>Hall, </em>13 <em>do. do. </em>286.)</p>\n<p data-order=\"113\" data-type=\"legal\" id=\"b405-7\">After the execution of this assignment and new agreement by the maker of the note, to pay any balance, and the execution, by the plaintiffs, of the instrument releasing the maker from all demands, no action could be maintained on, this note by the plaintiffs against the maker. <em>(Hosack </em>v. Rogers, 25 Wendell, 313, 14, and 355, 6.)</p>\n<p data-order=\"114\" data-type=\"legal\" id=\"b405-8\">And if plaintiffs could maintain no action on the note against the maker, most clearly they cannot against the endorser.</p>\n<p data-order=\"115\" data-type=\"legal\" id=\"b405-9\"><em>Fourth. </em>If the position contended for in the last point should not be sustained by the court, then we insist, that the said assignment and new agreement to pay the balance, if any, in seven years, by the maker, and the release to him by the plaintiffs was a valid extension to the maker of the time of payment for any balance there might be due, for seven years, and the endorser was thereby discharged. (3 <em>Kent, </em>111, <em>4dh ed.)</em></p>\n<p data-order=\"116\" data-type=\"legal\" id=\"b405-10\"><em>Fifth. </em>If the endorser should, not be deemed to have been discharged by the transaction between the maker and the plaintiffs, clearly the plaintiffs could maintain no action against the maker on this note, until all the assigned property had been applied, and the balance remaining due thereby ascertained; and so long as the plaintiffs are precluded, by their own agreement and acts, from maintaining an action against the maker, their remedy is suspended against the endorser.</p>\n<p data-order=\"117\" data-type=\"legal\" id=\"b406-3\"><page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"390\">*390</page-number><em>Sixth. </em>The court below erred, in admitting the letter of T.

The word \u201c protest,\u201d contained in the defendant\u2019s waiver, dated January 28, 1840, has been adopted in legal and mercantile language, as comprehending <em>demand and notice, </em>when applied to a promissory note. <em>(Union Bank </em>v. <em>Hyde, </em>6 <em>Wheaton, </em>512; 6 <em>Ad. </em>&amp; <em>El. </em>167, 180; <em>Laws of </em>1833, <em>p. </em>394, \u00a7 8 ; <em>id. </em>1837, <em>p. </em>554, <em>sec. </em>1; 15 <em>East, </em>505; <em>Utica Bank </em>v. <em>Smedes, </em>20 <em>Johns. </em>377-384.)</p>\n<p data-order=\"125\" data-type=\"legal\" id=\"b406-11\">2.

Independent of the letter of January, 28, 1840, plaintiffs were relieved by the\" other circumstances of the case from making demand or giving notice. Immediately prior to the maturity of this note, the maker executed an assignment of all his effects, in which he treated the note as a debt <em>due to the </em>defendant, and <em>in that character </em>gave it priority of payment. The defendant assented to this assignment, took possession of the fund thereby awarded to him, <em>as creditor of the assignor in respect of this </em>note, and transferred such fund to the plaintiffs, in part payment. By this act the defendant assumed the office of paymaster, in respect to this note. <em>(Corney </em>v. <em>Pacosta, </em>1 <em>Esp. </em>303; <em>Bond </em>v. Farnham, 5 <em>Mass. </em>171; <em>Com.

Gardiner, Bronson, Jewett, Jones &amp; Wright, J. J., <em>for affirmance. </em>Ruggles, Gray 6 Johnson, <em>for reversal.</em></p>\n<p id=\"b408-12\">Note,\u2014Gardiner, J., delivered the prevailing opinion of the court, and said: That the term \u201c protest,\u201d in a strict technical sense, is not applicable to promissory notes. The word, however, has by general usage acquired a more extensive signification, and in a case like the present includes <em>all those acts which by law are necessary to charge an endorser.</em></p>\n<p id=\"b408-13\">And that the <em>letter of the endorser </em>of the 28th January, 1840, furnished <em>prima facie </em>evidence of an intent by the endorser <em>to waive demand of payment and notice, </em>to which he was otherwise entitled.</p>\n<p id=\"b408-14\">On the point that the written statement signed by the plaintiffs and others, dated 8th February, 1840, was a valid discharge by the plaintiffs of Thomas Coddington, the maker of the note, from all liability thereon, and consequently of the <em>endorser\u2014held, </em>that taking the schedule (A) in connection with the assignment, and the written direction of the defendant to Davis, as assignee, on <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"393\">*393</page-number>the 24th of January, the defendant recognized this as a debt due from Thomas Coddington to <em>himself, </em>by claiming under the assignment by which it was so declared, and as a debt due <em>from him </em>to the <em>plaintiffs </em>by a voluntary application of his private funds to its payment.</p>\n<p id=\"b409-5\">The discharge refers to and absolutely adopts the assignment, with all its conditions and provisions as its basis. And the engagement entered into by Thomas Coddington at the time of the execution of the release confirms this view.</p>\n<p id=\"b409-6\">The discharge being legally binding upon the parties, it does not extend to this demand, and cannot have the effect either to discharge or extend the time of payment of the note in question.</p>\n<p id=\"b409-7\">Ruaoi/ES, J., delivered a <em>dissenting </em>opinion, in which he discussed only the effect of the instrument called the discharge, dated on the 8th February, 1840, signed by Davis, Brooks &amp; Co., and said :</p>\n<p id=\"b409-8\">\u201c Finally. From reading the three instruments together, that is to say, the assignment and schedules, the discharge and the written promise of T. B. Goddington, I am brought to the following conclusions:</p>\n<p id=\"b409-9\"><em>\u201cFirst. </em>That by the assignment and schedules, without reference to any other paper, Davis, Brooks &amp; Co. were entitled to the dividends on the $10,000 debt, mentioned in schedule A, as the creditors of <em>T. B. Coddington, </em>although that debt was set down against the name of Samuel Coddington as endorser.</p>\n<p id=\"b409-10\"><em>\u201cSecond. </em>That by the recitals in the discharge, <em>Davis, Brooks 8f Co. </em>referred to the debts due from T. B. Coddington to them, of which this was the principal one, and therefore include this debt: that they do not refer to the debts set down to the names of <em>Davis, Brooks 8? Co., </em>and therefore do not exclude it.</p>\n<p id=\"b409-11\">\u201c <em>Third. </em>That the operative words in the body of the discharge are amply sufficient to include the debt in question, and do include it.</p>\n<p id=\"b409-12\"><em>\u201cFourth. </em>That the obvious meaning of the discharge was, that it should operate on all debts on which the creditors who signed it were respectively entitled to dividends; and,</p>\n<p id=\"b409-13\">\u201c <em>Fifth. </em>That <em>Davis, Brooks 8f Co., </em>in conformity with this construction, took Thomas B. Coddington\u2019s written promise to pay, at the end of seven years, the balance that might remain due on this note, and on his other debts, after deducting what might be realized from the assignment.\u201d</p>\n<p id=\"b409-14\">And was therefore of opinion that if the instrument signed by Davis, Brooks &amp; Co. of the 8th February, 1840, did not entirely discharge <em>Thomas B. Coddington </em>from all liability on the $10,000 note as maker, it operated beyond a doubt to <em>extend the time of the payment of the debt until the expiration of seven years from the date of the instrument, </em>and therefore discharged the endorser. That the judgment of the supreme court should be reversed, and a new trial granted.</p>\n<p id=\"b409-15\"><em>Reported, </em>1 Comstock, 186.</p>\n</opinion>\n</casebody>\n",
