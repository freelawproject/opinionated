The defendant is not precluded from contesting the facts charged in the indictment, if the decision of the court on the legal question presented by the demurrer should be found against him.</p>\n<p data-order=\"21\" data-type=\"legal\" id=\"b384-9\"><em>Second. </em>The act alleged in the indictment to have been committed by S. Adams, and which is charged as a crime against the people of New-York in their sovereign capacity, was committed by him, as alleged, while he was in the state of Ohio, and out of the state and jurisdiction of the government of New-York.</p>\n<p data-order=\"22\" data-type=\"legal\" id=\"b384-10\"><em>Third. </em>The said S.

Adams, at the time he so committed said act, owed no allegiance, either permanent or temporary,\" to the government of the state of New-York, and never had at any time previous thereto owed any such allegiance to said government of New-York. Because,</p>\n<p data-order=\"24\" data-type=\"legal\" id=\"b385-6\">1.

Such allegiance cannot be created by construction or by fiction.</p>\n<p data-order=\"28\" data-type=\"legal\" id=\"b385-10\"><em>Fifth. </em>Allegiance, or the obligation to obey the government of a country, is essential to subject a person to punishment for the violation of its public laws against crime, except in the case of piracy or other offences which are a violation of the public law of nations. <em>(The King </em>v. <em>Despardo, 1st Taunton, </em>26.)</p>\n<p data-order=\"29\" data-type=\"legal\" id=\"b385-11\"><em>Sixth. </em>Such allegiance is essential for the purpose aforesaid, whether the act done be a direct infringement of allegiance, or of a law which derives its sanction only from such allegiance, in which alone consists the obligation of the party to obey it.</p>\n<p data-order=\"30\" data-type=\"legal\" id=\"b385-12\"><em>Seventh. </em>The said Samuel Adams, not owing any allegiance of any kind to the government of New-York, and being under no obligation of political or legal obedience to said government, \u2018 at the time he so committed said act, was not, and is not, legally guilty by reason thereof, of any crime against the government of New-York, and was not, and is not, subject to any penalty which, by the laws of New-York, might be inflicted upon any <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"370\">*370</page-number>person or persons for the doing.of acts, owing at any time allegiance and political obedience, and subject to the jurisdiction of the last mentioned state. <em>(The State </em>v. <em>Knight, Taylor\u2019s Morth Carolina Reports, </em>65. <em>Ex parte Smith, Law Reporter, vol. vi, p. </em>57.)</p>\n<p data-order=\"31\" data-type=\"legal\" id=\"b386-4\">.

Supposing New-York and Ohio to be different counties of the same state or jurisdiction, the venue, it will not be denied, is in New-York. <em>(Rex </em>v. <em>Batterby, B. </em>&amp; <em>Ald. </em>179; <em>Rex </em>v. <em>Coombs. </em>1 <em>Leach Crown L. </em>432, 388; <em>Esser\u2019s Case, </em>1 <em>East P.

In determining venue the court determines jurisdiction. Venue establishes at what place the criminal was guilty, and as a consequence thereof, at what place he shall be tried, without reference to allegiance or to the place where the criminal actually was at the time the crime was committed. The broad principle being \u201c <em>crimen trahit personam.\u201d </em>(g@P\u201c 5 I). Sr <em>R. </em>616; 3 <em>B. C. </em>706\u2014cited with approbation <em>Rex </em>v. <em>Batterby, </em>4 <em>B. </em>&amp; <em>A. </em>179; <em>Chit. Crim. Law, et sup.)</em></p>\n<p data-order=\"68\" data-type=\"legal\" id=\"b389-8\">The offence for which the prisoner is indicted is a felony, and the venue is absolute, single, and exclusive. <em>(Andrew </em>v. <em>Dieterich, </em>14 <em>Wend. </em>36; <em>English Cases, cited in Harrison\u2019s Digest, title \u201c Crim.

The doctrine of constructive presence knows of no such exception. The principle, <em>\u201ccrimen trahit personam,\u201d </em>applies whether the offender be out of the state or out of the county. \u201c He will not be allowed,\u201d in the language of Judge Co wen, \u201cto gainsay the fact that he was present.\u201d <em>(Rathbun\u2019s Case, </em>21 <em>Wend. </em>509 <em>Barkhampsted </em>v. <em>Parsons, </em>3 <em>Count. </em>1; <em>Harvey\u2019s </em>Case, 8 <em>Am.

The duty of allegiance is not essential to create amenability to criminal law, nor need it be shown except in cases in which the breach of allegiance is the essence of or an ingredient in the offence. And the averments in such indictments vary essentially from indictments on common law felonies. (5 <em>St. Trial, </em>462, <em>Howell; Foster\u2019s Crown Law, </em>188,' discourse upon high treason; <em>Rex </em>v. <em>Johnson, </em>6 <em>East. </em>590; <em>S.

But simply that courts will not execute within their own jurisdiction the criminal laws of a foreign jurisdiction. So all the cases will he found. (Such was <em>Scoville </em>v. <em>Canfield, </em>14, <em>J. R. </em>338 ; <em>Common. </em>v. Green, 17 <em>Mass. </em>515.)</p>\n<p data-order=\"73\" data-type=\"legal\" id=\"b390-7\"><em>Seventh. </em>Ignorance, on the part of the defendant, of the laws of our state, will not be implied, and would he no defence. <em>(Rex </em>v. <em>Esop, Car. &amp; P. </em>456.)</p>\n<p data-order=\"74\" data-type=\"legal\" id=\"b390-8\">Besides, the <em>stat. </em>33 <em>Hen. </em>8, <em>ch. </em>1, was a part of the common law of the land, brought here at the time of the emigration of our ancestors. (1 <em>Kent </em>Com, 472, <em>notes a and b, ed. </em>1840; <em>Carwood </em>v. <em>State of Alabama, </em>1 <em>Stev. </em>&amp; <em>Port. </em>327, <em>and cases cited.)</em></p>\n<p data-order=\"75\" data-type=\"legal\" id=\"b390-9\">This particular statute has been declared to be part of the common law of Massachusetts. <em>(Com. </em>v. <em>Hanen, </em>6 <em>Mass. </em>72.)</p>\n<p data-order=\"76\" data-type=\"legal\" id=\"b390-10\">However modified by statute, it is part of the common law <em>Cheat\u2014a crimen </em>falsi\u2014known to every man\u2019s conscience to be an immoral and criminal act\u2014for which all courts will hold a man amenable when found at any time, or in any way, within their jurisdiction.</p>\n<p data-order=\"77\" data-type=\"legal\" id=\"b390-11\"><em>Eighth. </em>We have hitherto considered the case as if Ohio <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"375\">*375</page-number>and New-York bore no other relation to each other than England and France. But the federal constitution makes the citizens of each state entitled to all privileges and immunities of citizens in the several states. <em>(XI. S. Const., art. </em>4, <em>sec. </em>2.)</p>\n<p data-order=\"78\" data-type=\"legal\" id=\"b391-5\">It is not necessary for the court to consider the duty of the executive in such cases, or whether he would be bound to deliver up as a fugitive. The court now finds the prisoner within its jurisdiction.</p>\n<p data-order=\"79\" data-type=\"legal\" id=\"b391-6\">(McKeon.) \u2014Allegiance only in question when the charge is treason. Pirates taken on the high seas are punished, though they owe- no allegiance. Protection to society is the object of the criminal law. \u201cIS\u00ae,</p>\n<p data-order=\"80\" data-type=\"legal\" id=\"b391-7\">J\u00ae\u00ae\" (Ogden Hoffman, same side.)\u2014Where the crime is committed there the criminal is answerable. It is said cases cited were upon the mere question of venue. In criminal cases venue is matter of substance. Admitted a man may be in a county where he never was, if the crime was there. Another <em>state </em>does not alter the principle.</p>\n<p data-order=\"81\" data-type=\"legal\" id=\"b391-8\">Allegiance is a different thing from a duty to obey the laws and liability to punishment.</p>\n<p data-order=\"82\" data-type=\"legal\" id=\"b391-9\">If any allegiance here as exists elsewhere, it would be to the government of the U. S.</p>\n<p data-order=\"83\" data-type=\"legal\" id=\"b391-10\">No case holds that allegiance is necessary to jurisdiction. (1 <em>Esp. </em>62; 6 <em>East, </em>602 ; 7 <em>East, </em>65, <em>S. C.) </em>In 6 <em>East, </em>attorney general cites a case in point on <em>hah. corp. </em>(21 <em>W.; </em>2 <em>Sumner, </em>485.)</p>\n<p data-order=\"84\" data-type=\"legal\" id=\"b391-11\">Allegiance nothing to do with the question, when crime is against statute or common law. Only comes in in treason or when it gives greater enormity to crime.</p>\n<p data-order=\"85\" data-type=\"legal\" id=\"b391-12\">Allegiance may give jurisdiction over crimes committed abroad, but want of it cannot deprive of jurisdiction where the offence was committed. ' (1 <em>Taunt. </em>25; 7 <em>Crunch, </em>139; 25 <em>Wend. </em>601; 3 <em>Count. </em>5.)</p>\n<p data-order=\"86\" data-type=\"legal\" id=\"b391-13\">Court of the United States gives the defendant all the privileges of a citizen of this state. Here the offence is <em>malum in se. </em>Defendant knew he was violating laws of God and man. \u00b0\u00a9H</p>\n<opinion data-order=\"87\" data-type=\"opinion\" id=\"x999-1\" type=\"majority\">\n<p id=\"b392-3\"><page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"376\">*376</page-number>Decision.\u2014Judgment affirmed unanimously.</p>\n<p id=\"b392-4\">Note.\u2014Gardiner, J., delivered the opinion of the court, in which Bronson, J., concurred, by stating the conclusions at which he arrived.'</p>\n<p id=\"b392-5\"><em>Held, </em>that the defendant may be rightfully punished. He had violated a law to which he owed obedience, for it was written' upon his own conscience, and obligatory everywhere. To that law the statute of this state has affixed a penalty, to be enforced in her own tribunals for the protection of her own citizens.</p>\n<p id=\"b392-6\">The immunity he enjoyed at home from arrest and punishment was not due to him as a criminal, or as a citizen of Ohio, but because he had injured no one whom that state was bound to protect, and because the inviolability of its territory was an essential to its sovereignty and independence. The prisoner knew that, through his agent, he was defrauding those who were entitled to the protection of our laws, and he cannot be permitted to say that he did not know that it was unlawful to cheat in New-York as well as in Ohio. <em>(Per </em>Gardiner, J.)</p>\n<p id=\"b392-7\">Also <em>held, </em>that it was not a matter of any importance whether the defendant owed allegiance to this state or not. But two cases where the question of allegiance can have anything to do with a criminal prosecution: 1st, Treason; 2d, Where the government proposes to punish offences committed by its own citizens beyond the territorial limits of the state. When the offenee, not being treason, is committed within this state, the question of allegiance nothing to do with the matter. ,</p>\n<p id=\"b392-8\">Jurisdiction of the offence, or subject matter, and jurisdiction to try the offender, are very different things. The first exists whenever the offence was committed within this state; and the second, when the offender is brought into court, and not before. And this is so whether he be a citizen or not. <em>(Per </em>Bronson, J.)</p>\n<p id=\"b392-9\"><em>Reported </em>1 Comstock, 173.</p>\n</opinion>\n</casebody>\n",
