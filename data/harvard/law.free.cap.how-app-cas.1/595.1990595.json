The defendant brought error, and removed the record of judgment to the court for the correction of errors, and upon allegation of diminution in the record, and writ of certiorari, caused the writ of nuisance, and the rule denying the motion in arrest of judgment, to be certified to the court of errors. An assignment and joinder in error were then put in.

Tracy, Counsel </em>for plaintiff in error.</attorneys>\n<p data-order=\"17\" data-type=\"legal\" id=\"b614-8\"><em>First. </em>This action is the assize of nuisance of the common law as modified by the provisions of the revised statutes, but not altered or modified by any other statute, resolution of the courts, or rule of practice. It is not the common law remedy as it might have existed modified by acts of parliament and rules of practice in England on the 19th of April, 1775, but the original remedy changed only by the revised statutes. <em>{Constitution, art. </em>8, \u00a7 13; 1 <em>R. S. p. </em>46 <em>in 3d ed. j </em>2 <em>R. S. </em>332, <em>3d ed. p. </em>427, \u00a7\u00a7 1, 3, 7.)</p>\n<p data-order=\"18\" data-type=\"legal\" id=\"b614-9\"><em>Second. </em>The writ of nuisance could be maintained only by the owner of the <em>freehold </em>affected by the nuisance. The tenant of an estate less than a freehold could not bring the action. The revisors, in continuing the action, preserved this one of its peculiar features. <em>{Shepard\u2019s Grand Abr., part 2, p, </em>467, <em>and authorities there cited ; </em>3 <em>Bl. Com. 220, </em>221,222.; <em>Rastell\u2019s Entries, </em>441; <em>Fitz. Nat.

S. </em>832.)</p>\n<p data-order=\"19\" data-type=\"legal\" id=\"b615-6\"><em>Third. </em>The action being no otherwise changed by the statute, all its incidents not affected by the statute remain. The rules of pleading recognized by the common law, where not changed by act of the legislature or the express rules of practice of our courts, must therefore govern it. <em>(Harrison </em>v. <em>McIntosh, </em>1 <em>John. </em>384; <em>Hopkins </em>v. <em>Hopkins, </em>10 <em>T. R. </em>369.)</p>\n<p data-order=\"20\" data-type=\"legal\" id=\"b615-8\">The following well established rules must apply :\u2014</p>\n<p data-order=\"21\" data-type=\"legal\" id=\"b615-9\">1. That the count must follow and be comforable to the writ: 6 <em>Com. Big. Pleader, c. </em>13, <em>c. </em>14; <em>Co. Lit. </em>303, <em>a; Bac. ab, Pleas and Pleading, b. </em>4, <em>p. </em>12; <em>Gould\u2019s PI. Ch. </em>4, \u00a7\u00a7 1, 51.)</p>\n<p data-order=\"22\" data-type=\"legal\" id=\"b615-11\">2. That the count must set forth plainly and with certainty every fact and circumstance material for the maintenance of the action. (6 <em>Com. Dig. Pleader, c. </em>22, <em>c. </em>34, <em>c. </em>50, <em>c. </em>76; <em>Pinckney </em>v. <em>Easthund. in Rutland, </em>2 <em>Saunders R. </em>379, 380; <em>Bac. ab. \u201c Pleas and Pleading,\u201d b. 4, above cited, b. </em>5; <em>Vau. </em>8, 58; <em>Gould\u2019s Pleading, ch. </em>4, \u00a7\u00a7 7, 8, 11, 12, 24, 26, 51.)</p>\n<p data-order=\"23\" data-type=\"legal\" id=\"b615-12\">It follows, therefore, that in the count upon a writ of nuisance, the following fact be stated:\u2014</p>\n<p data-order=\"24\" data-type=\"legal\" id=\"b615-13\">1. That the plaintiff owned the premises affected by the nuisance <em>as his freehold.</em></p>\n<p data-order=\"25\" data-type=\"attorneys\" id=\"b615-14\">2. That the defendant erected the nuisance to <em>its </em>injury.</p>\n<p data-order=\"26\" data-type=\"legal\" id=\"b615-15\"><em>Fourth. </em>In each of the counts contained in the declaration in this case, the necessary fact that the plaintiff held <em>as his freehold </em>the premises affected is omitted. 'He declares upon a <em>possessory </em>interest only. He simply alleges that he <em>\u201chath been and is possessed,\u201d </em>&amp;c. They are therefore all bad for <em>defect of substance, </em>and are not cured by verdict.</p>\n<p data-order=\"27\" data-type=\"legal\" id=\"b615-17\">A verdict only cures such omissions in the count as must\" necessarily have been proved in order to support the allegations contained in it, nothing more. It only advises the court that each fact alleged in the count is proved as alleged. <em>(Avery </em>v. <em>Hook, </em>2 <em>Cowper, </em>825; <em>Graham\u2019s Pr., 2d ed., </em>657, <em>and cases there died; Bishop </em>v. <em>Hayward, </em>1 <em>T. R. </em>470; <em>Sweetapple </em>v. <em>Jesse, </em>5 <em>Barn. &amp; Adol. </em>27; 27 <em>E. C. L. </em>25; <em>Harrison </em>v. <em>McIntosh, </em>1 <em>J. R. </em>380; <em>Hopkins </em>v. <em>Hopkins, </em>10 <em>J. R. </em>369.)</p>\n<p data-order=\"28\" data-type=\"legal\" id=\"b616-3\"><page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"600\">*600</page-number><em>Fifth. </em>Each of the counts in the declaration being defective <em>in substance, </em>and showing no title in the plaintiff to recover, the supreme court erred in denying the motion in arrest. <em>(Gr. Pr. </em>641, <em>and cases there cited, viz., Sweetapple </em>v. <em>Jesse, </em>5 <em>Barn. </em>&amp; <em>Adol. </em>27; 2 <em>Chitty's Archbold, </em>948; 5 <em>Coke, </em>45, <em>Freeman's case.)</em></p>\n<p data-order=\"29\" data-type=\"legal\" id=\"b616-4\"><em>Sixth. </em>Another peculiar feature of the assize of nuisance is, at any time while the writ is pending the defendant may abate the nuisance, and the writ itself shall thereupon abate. <em>(Fitzherbert JYat. Breb. p. </em>426, <em>note a, citing </em>2, <em>h. </em>4,11, <em>6th ed. </em>2, <em>and ass. </em>454.)</p>\n<p data-order=\"30\" data-type=\"legal\" id=\"b616-5\"><em>Seventh. </em>The action of nuisance retains its ancient character of'a <em>real action. </em>The terms employed in the revised statutes abolish real actions, except this. It varies widely in its character from personal actions. (2 <em>R. S. </em>343, \u00a7 24, 3d <em>ed., </em>436.)</p>\n<p data-order=\"31\" data-type=\"legal\" id=\"b616-6\">1. It is not classed by the revisors with personal actions, but with ejectment, partition, waste and proceedings to quiet a title. (2 <em>R. S. </em>302, 3d <em>ed., p. </em>399.)</p>\n<p data-order=\"32\" data-type=\"legal\" id=\"b616-7\">2. It is not commenced as personal actions are, by capias or declaration, but by writ. (2 <em>R. S. </em>357, 3d <em>ed., </em>440.)</p>\n<p data-order=\"33\" data-type=\"legal\" id=\"b616-8\">3. The writ need not necessarily be served personally, but may, in case defendant cannot he found, be served by leaving a copy at his dwelling-house. (2 <em>R. S. </em>332, \u00a7 4,3d <em>ed., </em>427.)</p>\n<p data-order=\"34\" data-type=\"legal\" id=\"b616-9\">4. In case- of default, instead of an ordinary inquest, the sheriff takes a jury to view the premises and inquire of the nuisance as well as of the damages. (2 <em>R. S. </em>332, \u00a7 5, 3d <em>ed., 427.)</em></p>\n<p data-order=\"35\" data-type=\"legal\" id=\"b616-10\"><em>5. </em>There is no repeal of the common law provision that, pending the suit, the defendant may abate the nuisance, and thus abate the suit.</p>\n<p data-order=\"36\" data-type=\"legal\" id=\"b616-11\"><em>Eighth. </em>The plaintiff below cannot avoid our conclusions as to the defect in his declaration by calling his action anything else than a writ of nuisance. It is either that or nothing. It is commenced by the original given by the statute. It recites the original, as a declaration in that action should, and concludes as well as commences in nuisance. The difficulty with it is, that if the declaration he true in every particular, it does not authorize a recovery in that action. (2 <em>R. S. </em>347, \u00a7 1.)</p>\n<p data-order=\"37\" data-type=\"legal\" id=\"b617-4\"><page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"601\">*601</page-number>1. It is not enough to say that the declaration contained all which would he necessary to show in order to warrant a recovery in an action upon the case for a nuisance. Such an action is a <em>personal action </em>for the recovery of damages only, the proceedings in which are regulated in chapter 6 of the 3d part of the revised statutes, (3d ed. <em>vol. </em>2, <em>p. </em>439 ;) and it must be commenced against a natural person only by capias or by declaration. It could not be commenced by original writ issuing out of the supreme court. <em>(Hayward </em>v. <em>Hoyt, </em>9 <em>Wend. </em>484; <em>McMurray </em>v. <em>Rawson, </em>3 <em>Hill, </em>59; <em>Kent </em>v. <em>McNeal, </em>1 <em>Den. </em>436.)</p>\n<p data-order=\"38\" data-type=\"legal\" id=\"b617-5\">2. If the plaintiff below desired to recover damages for the injury to his possession, he might have brought his action on the case for a nuisance. \u25a0 He did not do this. He elected the more severe common law proceeding by original writ, in order to be enabled by his judgment to throw down the defendant\u2019s erection, and having chosen his form of action, he must keep within the rules which govern1 it. (3 <em>Bl. Com. </em>220, <em>and authorities under the last </em>subdivision.)</p>\n<p data-order=\"39\" data-type=\"legal\" id=\"b617-6\">3. The plaintiff, by electing the remedy of writ of nuisance, gave the defendant the right to abate the nuisance pending the suit, and thus abate the writ. If the plaintiff is permitted to change his action after it is commenced, he may deprive a defendant of this right peculiar to the writ of nuisance.</p>\n<p data-order=\"40\" data-type=\"legal\" id=\"b617-7\">4. The fact that the supreme court gave such a judgment-upon the verdict as if the suit had been an action on the case, will not change the action nor cure the defect we complain of. If an action on the case for a nuisance can be commenced by original writ, there is no good reason why any other action on the case may not; as, for instance, slander, or assumpsit; nor why one may not commence any such action by a summons in waste issued pursuant to the statute. (2 <em>R. S. </em>333, 3d. <em>ed. </em>428.)</p>\n<p data-order=\"41\" data-type=\"legal\" id=\"b617-8\">\u25a05. The decision in the case of McFarland v. Townsend (17 <em>Wend. </em>440) does not affect this case. That case was decided upon the ground that the fact that the defendant was brought into court by a writ of nuisance did not appear, and that the declaration was a good declaration in the action it purported to be in, which was trespass. All the remainder of the <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"602\">*602</page-number>decision was <em>obiter. (Nichols </em>v. <em>Renss. Mutual Ins. Company, 22 Wend. </em>128.)</p>\n<p data-order=\"42\" data-type=\"legal\" id=\"b618-4\">Our claim is <em>not </em>that the declaration is in another form of action from the writ, but that it is a declaration in the same form of action, and that it fails to make out a title in that form of action. <em>(Turing </em>v. <em>Jones, </em>5 <em>T. R. 402 ; 2 Wils. </em>394.)</p>\n<p data-order=\"43\" data-type=\"legal\" id=\"b618-5\"><em>Ninth. </em>The plea of the defendant below taking issue upon the declaration did not cure its defects. If a declaration be deficient in substance, the plea cannot make it good. <em>(Doctrina placitandi, </em>69; <em>English </em>v. <em>Burnell, </em>2 <em>Wilson, </em>260; <em>Bain </em>v. <em>Clark, </em>10 <em>Johns. R. </em>424; <em>Doctor Bonhome\u2019s case, </em>8 <em>Co. </em>114; 1 <em>Salk. </em>364; <em>Carth. </em>371; <em>Pelton </em>v. <em>Ward, </em>3 <em>Caines, </em>76; <em>Hill v.

It may have been good ground of <em>special </em>demurrer, but nothing more.</p>\n<p data-order=\"53\" data-type=\"legal\" id=\"b619-5\"><em>Fifth. </em>The only mode of taking advantage of a variance between the writ and declaration, as not being in the same action, was by motion to set aside the declaration for irregularity. (1 <em>Wend. </em>305; 4 <em>J. R. </em>484; 12 <em>Wend. </em>271.)</p>\n<p data-order=\"54\" data-type=\"attorneys\" id=\"b619-6\">HHP1 Could not even have pleaded in abatement. (17 <em>W. </em>440.)</p>\n<p data-order=\"55\" data-type=\"legal\" id=\"b619-7\"><em>Sixth. </em>It is not pretended that in this action, as stated in the declaration, the plaintiff is or possibly could be entitled to the judgment of removal given by the statute in the real action of nuisance. No such judgment has been asked for or rendered\u2014but the plaintiff was entitled to his judgment on the verdict for his damages with costs as in any other personal action: and this is the judgment and the only judgment that has been rendered.</p>\n<p data-order=\"56\" data-type=\"legal\" id=\"b619-8\"><em>Seventh. </em>The plaintiff in error neither has nor pretends to' any merits\u2014his ground is purely and merely <em>technical; </em>and he could have availed himself of it only as a <em>matter of practice </em>by motion to set aside the declaration for a technical variance.

It was enough that he appeared and pleaded to the declaration in an action of which the court had jurisdiction.
