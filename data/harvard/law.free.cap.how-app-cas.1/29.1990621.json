The certificate of sale was never received by the defendant, that I know of; have been in the habit of taking from the post office letters directed t &gt; the defendant every day for a long time. Defendant went away the next day, or the second day, after the notes were sen to the plaintiff. Witness took all the defendant\u2019s letters from the post office for about three weeks afterwards; don\u2019t know of defendant\u2019s receiving any letters except what I took from the post office.

The witness then stated that after this suit was commenced, the defendant put in a plea which was demurred to, and the demurrer sustained. From that plea I inferred that defendant objected to paying this note, because he had no.t received the sheriff\u2019s certificate of sale\u2014and I then wrote to the plaintiff, stating the substance of the plea, and my supposition that he defended the suit on that account. The plaintiff sent a letter endorsing the certificate to me, saying that he had upon receipt of the defendant\u2019s notes assigned the certificate and acknowledged it, and had expected that the defendant would call for it on his way to the west, where he was expected to go respecting the property mentioned in the certificate, that he had kept the certificate to give to him when he came, and directing me if the defendant declined to pay the note because the certificate had not been sent to him, to give him the certificate and stop the suit and pay the costs, if the defendant would pay the note. I thereupon, on the 23d day of February last, offered to the defendant the certificate, and to take the amount of the note and interest without costs, and the defendant refused to receive it. The witness further testified that the certificate produced was the certificate sent to him by the plaintiff. The assignment thereon endorsed, bore date the second day of September 1842. The acknowledgement bore date the sixth day of September 1842.</summary>\n<summary data-order=\"41\" data-type=\"summary\" id=\"b48-4\">The assignment and acknowledgement were then read in evidence.</summary>\n<summary data-order=\"42\" data-type=\"summary\" id=\"b48-5\">The plaintiff then read in evidence a letter from the defendant to the plaintiff, dated August 14, 1842, as follows:,</summary>\n<summary data-order=\"43\" data-type=\"summary\" id=\"b48-6\">Coeymans, Aug. 14th, 1842.</summary>\n<summary data-order=\"44\" data-type=\"summary\" id=\"b48-7\">H.

That the defendant\u2019s letter of August 14th, 1842, contains a distinct offer to pay, or assume the payment of plaintiff'\u2019s judgment, damages, costs and expenses, by his notes; the plaintiff'by letter of August 15,1842, agrees to accept the notes of the defendant, and directs him to forward them by mail, and the minds of the parties then met. The defendant by letter of August 31st, 1842, forwards the notes in compliance with the contract, and the whole bargain was closed. There was no bargain made about the assignment of the sheriff\u2019s certificate. The plaintiff in his postscript to his letter of August 15th, 1842, after accepting the. defendant\u2019s offer in the letter, asks what he shall do with the certificate. The defendant by his letter of August 31,1842, after stating that he sent the notes in compliance with the contract, requests the plaintiff to send him an assignment of the sheriff\u2019s certificate by.mail. This was a matter distinct from the bargain under which the notes were given, and concerning which the minds of the contracting <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"34\">*34</page-number>parties never met, and formed no part of the consideration of the defendant\u2019s notes.</summary>\n<summary data-order=\"52\" data-type=\"summary\" id=\"b50-4\">The Court decided as follows:</summary>\n<summary data-order=\"53\" data-type=\"summary\" id=\"b50-5\">The question of fact in this case involves the point whether the defendant was to receive from the plaintiff as a part of the contract between them, the assignment of the judgment and of the certificate. The defendant\u2019s letter of the 14th August does not so state the matter, but as the plaintiff\u2019s previous letter of the 4th July is not proved, we are left to ascertain its contents from the tenor of the plaintiff\u2019s letter of the 15th August, in which he treats the defendant\u2019s proposition as relating to the certificate of sale, and in which he asks, \u201c Shall I forward you on receipt of the notes the certificate!\u201d From these letters it is apparent that the contract did relate to the certificate, and the defendant\u2019s reply of the 31st August, requests the same to be sent by mail. It is not essential to pursue the inquiry as to the judgment, because neither certificate nor judgment were forwarded to the defendant, and if the contract embraced the certificate alone, the question would still arise, whether the plaintiff had performed 'his part of the contract. As the plaintiff treats the defendant\u2019s proposition as relating to the certificate, and as the defendant required the same to be sent agreeably to the plaintiff\u2019s inquiry, it seems to me that we must asssume that. both parties agreed that the certificate should be - sent. That it was a part of the original understanding, is presumable, from the plaintiff\u2019s letter on the subject, prior to the receipt of the notes, and the defendant\u2019s letter when he sent his notes to the plaintiff. It is true that the defendant ought to have produced the plaintiff\u2019s letter of the 4th ultimo, noticed in answer of the 14th August, but nevertheless, the plaintiff\u2019s reply of the 15th August, sufficiently evidences the fact that the defendant\u2019s proposal related'to the obtaining of the certificate of sale, and that the certificate was to be the defendant\u2019s, and was to be sent to him if he so desired. The defendant did so desire simultaneously with the delivery of his notes, and if the plaintiff did not wish to do what he had himself proposed, he ought to have returned the notes to the defendant,, and declined the proposition altogether, But the plaintiff insists <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"35\">*35</page-number>that the bargain was consummated by his letter of the 15th August, and that what took place afterward, although noticed in such letter, was not a part of the original contract,, and that the defendant must pay his notes, and sue the plaintiff for a breach of the new or additional agreement. This would be so, provided we came to the conclusion that the delivery of the certificate was no part of the contract. We, however, think that the plaintiff\u2019s letter of the 15th August, and the defendant\u2019s reply of the 31st did form a part of the original contract, so far at least as related to the delivery of the certificate by the plaintiff to the defendant.</summary>\n<summary data-order=\"54\" data-type=\"summary\" id=\"b51-4\">It is not absolutely necessary to express an opinion upon the necessity of the assignment of the certificate or of the judgment, but it is clear that the certificate itself was to be delivered to the defendant; and we furthermore find that the plaintiff acknowledged the assignment of the certificate on the 2d September 1842, but did not forward it according to the defendant\u2019s directions, given in pursuance of the plaintiff\u2019s previous inquiry, so that we can not doubt that an assignment was intended of the certificate from the defendant\u2019s own acts; and we do not doubt that this must be esteemed a part of the contract, because the plaintiff\u2019s inquiry was a part of his letter accepting defendant\u2019s proposal, and the defendant\u2019s directions were a part of his letter delivering the notes and responding to plaintiff\u2019s inquiry. So far as the directions went beyond the plaintiff s and defendant\u2019s previous letters there may be some question, but none, we think, so far as the letters agreed up to the 31st of August. Having thus concluded that the defendant was entitled to the certificate on the delivery of the notes, and that the plaintiff promised originally to send the same, we Eire left to consider whether the defendant has proved a failure of consideration, by the neglect to forward him the certificate. Looking at the testimony (fol. 9) it seems that the plaintiff even after this suit was brought, admitted that he held the certificate assigned, subject to be given to defendant when he should call for it, as the plaintiff expected, but we have no proof to justify such expectation, and can not infer it in opposition to the defendant\u2019s written request to have it sent 1o him by mail. But the plaintiff after suit brought, autho i 1 his attorney, if the defendant declined to pay his note, <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"36\">*36</page-number>because the certificate had not been sent to him, to give him the certificate, and stop the suit, and pay the costs, if the defendant would pay the note. This looks as if the plaintiff, although at first willing to give up the certificate and holding it subject to the defendant\u2019s call, made it afterward conditional if the defendant would pay his note The attorney swears that he accordingly offered to .the defendant the certificate, and to take the amount of the note and interest without costs, and the defendant refused to receive it. If this means that the defendant refused to receive it, on the condition of paying the note without costs, he was legally right; or if the proposition was so made, the defendant was not bound to accede to it. It looks throughout as if the plaintiff supposed that he would hold the papers until the notes were paid; and the only evidence to the contrary is the plaintiff\u2019s declaring that he would have delivered the paper if defendant had called for it. True, the plaintiff had acknowledged the assignment, but he did not send it as both parties had agreed, nor did he send any excuse for not having so sent the same. But whatever construction this testimony may admit of, it is evident that the defendant did not receive the assignment of the certificate, nor any excuse. If this is to be likened to a contract for the purchase of land, the defendant ought to have demanded the deed. Still if it were a part of the original bargain that the certificate or deed should be sent, and it was not, can the defendant be required to pay his note. The plaintiff did not give or forward the certificate, as he had promised, and the defendant did not receive it as he expected, and desired; nor did the latter know it had been executed, and was held subject to his call; nor had he any information on the subject, even in regard to a deed for land bought. I apprehend the rules of law in cases where there is no provision on the subject would yield to the express contract of the parties; and in regard to purchases of goods or choses in action, if one purchases by letter and the things are to be sent and are not sent, the notes delivered in satisfaction could not he collected; and if one buys goods at the vendor\u2019s, and they are turned out to him, and he pays by note, I apprehend that as between the original parties to the transaction, if the vendor retained the goods contrary to his agreement, the want or failure of the consideration <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"37\">*37</page-number>of the note might be shown; and at all events the damage arising out of the same bargain or agreement might be invoked by way of recoupment against the plaintiff\u2019s right of recovery under the proper plea (6 <em>Wend. </em>103; <em>1 Hill, </em>117; 3 <em>id. </em>171). The defendant in this case pleaded the general issue only, and he must show a total failure of consideration, otherwise he must resort to a cross action. If the defendant\u2019s letter of 31st August entitled him to an assignment of the judgment and certificate, then there could be no doubt that there was a partial failure, conceding that the executing of the assignment of the certificate and holding it, was equivalent to its delivery. But such defence would not be available under the general issue. If the contract only embraced the certificate, and the judgment was not to be assigned, then the failure of consideration may have been total, because I do not think that the execution of the assignment and holding it, was equivalent to its delivery. It is apparent then that the consideration of a promissory note is always inquirable into, between the original parties (7 <em>Cow. </em>322; 4 <em>Johns. </em>296; 7 <em>id. </em>26; 17 <em>id. </em>301); and whether the defendant in this case was entitled to an assignment of both judgment and certificate, or of the latter only, he had neither prior to the commencement of this suit. It seems necessarily to result that plaintiff can not maintain this suit, because the consideration failed and that judgment of nonsuit ought to be entered, and thereupon the court directed a nonsuit to be entered; to which decision and direction the counsel for the \" <em>J </em>i , plaintiff then and there excepted.</summary>\n<summary data-order=\"55\" data-type=\"summary\" id=\"b53-6\">Albany, September 29th, 1846.</summary>\n<summary data-order=\"56\" data-type=\"summary\" id=\"b53-7\">Sir\u2014I have your letter of yesterday.

The de<page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"38\">*38</page-number>fendant\u2019s letter of the 14th of August, 1842, <em>(page </em>17 <em>of Error Book), </em>contains a distinct offer to <em>assume </em>the payment of the plaintiff\u2019s judgment against his the defendant\u2019s brother, by giving his the defendant\u2019s notes for the amount payable on time, and stating unequivocally if the proposition met the plaintiff\u2019s views, that he would forward the notes immediately; and requesting the plaintiff to drop him a line, saying whether he would accept the proposition. The plaintiff\u2019s letter of August 15th, 1842, <em>(Error Book, p. </em>12), accepts the proposition, and directs the defendant to forward the notes. The minds of the contracting parties here met, and the agreement was perfect; and on the 31st of August, 1842, the defendant did forward his notes to the plaintiff, stating in his letter the amounts, date, <em>See., </em>arid then saying \u201c which I believe is a compliance with my proposition for your judgment so far, and I believe according to your understanding also.\u201d The defendant\u2019s contract was thus performed. He adds to his communication a request that plaintiff <em>would he kind enough </em>to assign the judgment, certificate of sale, &amp;c. This was no part of the contract. <em>(Martin </em>v. <em>Frith, </em>6 <em>Wend. </em>103).</p>\n<p data-order=\"62\" data-type=\"legal\" id=\"b54-6\"><em>Second. </em>After plaintiff\u2019s acceptance of defendant\u2019s proposition in his letter of the 15th of August, he asks in the postscript, whether he shall on receipt of notes <em>forward </em>defendant the certificate.</p>\n<p data-order=\"63\" data-type=\"legal\" id=\"b54-7\">This was no part of the proposition, or its acceptance, and was not so considered or treated by the defendant in his letter of the 31st August.</p>\n<p data-order=\"64\" data-type=\"legal\" id=\"b54-8\"><em>Third. </em>The defendant in his letter of the 31st August, asks as a favor, what neither party had before thought of, or at least said any thing about, namely, that plaintiff would \u201cbe kind enough to assign the judgment and the certificate of sale thereon, duly acknowledging such assignment,\u201d <em>See., </em>and to forward the same by mail,\u2014this clearly was no part of the contract.</p>\n<p data-order=\"65\" data-type=\"legal\" id=\"b54-9\"><em>Fourth. </em>If it is not clear that the contract was made by the defendant\u2019s letter of the 14th August, and the plaintiff\u2019s answer (excluding the postscript) of the 15th August, then it was a question of fact and not of law, what the contract was, and should have been submitted to the Jury, and the court erred in nonsuiting the plaintiff.</p>\n<attorneys data-order=\"66\" data-type=\"attorneys\" id=\"b55-3\"><page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"39\">*39</page-number><em>A. </em>Taber, for defendant in error.</attorneys>\n<p data-order=\"67\" data-type=\"legal\" id=\"b55-4\">The defendant in error was sued in the Common Pleas, on a note given for what he never had,\u2014what never was. offered to him until after he was sued,\u2014what he never agreed, nor did the plaintiff understand him to agree to pay for until he had it.
