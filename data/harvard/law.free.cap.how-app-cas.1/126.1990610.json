Whether an action brought against a <em>stockholder </em>of the Rossie Galena Company, individually, under the act incorporating that company, <em>(Statutes of </em>1837, jp. 445,) for goods, wares, &amp;c., delivered to the company, is an action founded upon the <em>statute} </em>and in the nature of a forfeiture, or upon the. <em>common law liability </em>of the stockholder, as upon contract ?</headnotes>\n<headnotes data-order=\"3\" data-type=\"headnotes\" id=\"b142-6\"><em>2. </em>Whether the statute of <em>limitations\u2014three </em>or <em>six </em>years, applies in such a suit ?</headnotes>\n<headnotes data-order=\"4\" data-type=\"headnotes\" id=\"b142-7\">3. Where the charter of a company contains an <em>individual liability clause </em>against its stockholders, to be enforced only after exhausting the legal remedy against the company, or on dissolution, are the stockholders, notwithstanding, liable at common law, originally and primarily, as partners or members of an unincorporated association ?</headnotes>\n<summary data-order=\"5\" data-type=\"summary\" id=\"b142-8\">This was an action brought by Corning and Horner against McCullough, as a stockholder of the Rossie Galena Company, for goods, wares, and merchandize sold and delivered by the plaintiffs to the said Rossie Galena Company. A judgment had previously been obtained by the plaintiffs against this company for the same cause of action; and an execution issued and returned unsatisfied. Whereupon this action was commenced against McCullough, a stockholder, on his <em>personal liability, </em>under the provisions of the act of incorporation of the company. <em>(Statutes of </em>1837, <em>'[&gt;\u25a0 </em>445.) It is provided by that act, that the stockholders of the corporation shall be jointly and severally <em>personally </em>liable for the payment of all debts and demands contracted by the corporation, and that any person having any demand against such corporation, may sue any stockholder or director in any court having cognizance thereof, and recover the same with costs. It is also provided, that before any such suit shall be commenced, judgment shall have been obtained against the corporation, and execution issued thereon, and returned unsatisfied, or that the corporation shall have been dissolved.</summary>\n<summary data-order=\"6\" data-type=\"summary\" id=\"b142-9\">The defendant pleaded, (secondly,) that the cause of action <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"127\">*127</page-number>did not accrue within three years next before the commencement of the suit.</summary>\n<summary data-order=\"7\" data-type=\"summary\" id=\"b143-5\">To this plea the plaintiffs demurred, and the defendant joined in demurrer.</summary>\n<summary data-order=\"8\" data-type=\"summary\" id=\"b143-6\">In the case of Freeland and others <em>v. </em>McCullough, (1 <em>Denio, </em>414,) the same plea was put in by the defendant, (the action being the same;) and the supreme court held that it was a bar, under 2 <em>R. S. </em>298, \u00a7 31. The supreme court in this case followed that decision.</summary>\n<attorneys data-order=\"9\" data-type=\"attorneys\" id=\"b143-7\"><em>D.

S. </em>297-8, \u00a7 81. <em>(Charter, Laws, </em>1837, <em>p. </em>445 ; <em>Another Co. </em>1837, <em>p. </em>441.)</p>\n<p data-order=\"12\" data-type=\"legal\" id=\"b143-10\">1. Independently of the act of incorporation, the members of the company would be liable for its debts as partners, at common law. <em>(Collyer on Part. </em>614, 626, 635, 651, 653.)</p>\n<p data-order=\"13\" data-type=\"legal\" id=\"b143-11\">2. The legislature, in incorporating the company, expressly refused to exempt them from their common law liability as partners. The charter virtually holds this language to the memhers : \u201c You may have a corporate capacity for the convenience of transacting business, and the facility of transferring your respective interests in the joint concern ; ,but you shall <em>remain </em>liable to the creditors of the association in <em>the same manner, </em>substantially, as though you had <em>not been incorporatedA (Hop. Ch. </em>300, 304; 19 <em>J. </em>474; <em>Sess. Laws of </em>1837, 445-6, \u00a7\u00a7 9,10; 2 <em>Denio, </em>119,123-4; <em>Harger </em>v. <em>McCullough, </em>2 <em>Hill, </em>268, 269, 270, <em>Moss </em>v. <em>Oakley ; </em>3 <em>Hill, </em>188, 190, <em>Bailey </em>v. <em>Bancker ; </em>26 <em>Wend. </em>43, 51-2; <em>Van Hook </em>v. <em>Whitlock; </em>20 <em>Wend. </em>614, 617, <em>Ex parte Van Riper ; </em>3 <em>H. </em>190; 3 <em>H. </em>41; 7 <em>H. </em>576.)</p>\n<p data-order=\"14\" data-type=\"legal\" id=\"b143-13\">3. The action, therefore, is not founded <em>upon a statute, </em>but upon the <em>common law liability </em>of \"the defendant to pay for goods sold to the company of which he was a member, he being a <em>partner, </em>and responsible as such.</p>\n<p data-order=\"15\" data-type=\"legal\" id=\"b144-3\"><page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"128\">*128</page-number>4. Even conceding that the action is founded partly on the act of incorporation, and partly on the common law, which we deny, still the case would not be within <em>2 R. S. </em>298, \u00a7 31. (26 <em>W. </em>51; 7 Paige, 380-1, <em>Van Hook </em>v. <em>Whitlock, per Walworth, Chancellor; </em>3 <em>P. </em>410.)</p>\n<p data-order=\"16\" data-type=\"legal\" id=\"b144-4\"><em>Second. </em>The supreme court have virtually decided in this case that all <em>statutory </em>remedies by action, except those which are given to the people, or a common informer, are embraced by 2 <em>R. S. </em>298, \u00a7 31. This construction will extend the provision to various actions which were plainly not contemplated by the legislature, and is therefore erroneous.</p>\n<p data-order=\"17\" data-type=\"legal\" id=\"b144-5\">1. Take, by way of example, the following actions, which are mere creatures of the statute, unknown to the common law, viz.:</p>\n<p data-order=\"18\" data-type=\"legal\" id=\"b144-6\">Actions by and <em>in the name </em>of the endorsee of a promissory note, against the maker. (12 <em>J. </em>93; 10 <em>W. </em>343; <em>Stat. 3d and 4th Ann. ch. </em>9, \u00a7 1; 11 <em>Pick.; Stat. at Large, p. </em>106.)</p>\n<p data-order=\"19\" data-type=\"legal\" id=\"b144-7\">Actions by and <em>in the name </em>of the assignee of a chose in action, where the assignor is dead, and there is no executor. <em>(See 2 R.

(1 <em>R. S. </em>747, \u00a7 23.)</p>\n<p data-order=\"23\" data-type=\"legal\" id=\"b144-11\">Actions against the maker and endorser of a promissory note, <em>jointly. (2 R.

(2 <em>R.

Laws of </em>1830, <em>pp. </em>412, 413.)</p>\n<p data-order=\"27\" data-type=\"legal\" id=\"b145-4\"><page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"129\">*129</page-number>Here <em>liability </em>and remedy created by statute.</p>\n<p data-order=\"28\" data-type=\"legal\" id=\"b145-5\">Actions against the owner of a carriage, for the malicious act of the driver. (1 <em>R. S. </em>696, \u00a7 6; 19 <em>W. </em>343; 2 <em>R. S. </em>452,. \u00a7 32; <em>Laws of </em>1837, 537 ; <em>heirs and </em>devisees, 2 <em>Williams Ex. </em>1201-2; 7 <em>East, </em>128.)</p>\n<p data-order=\"29\" data-type=\"legal\" id=\"b145-6\">2. The present action is still further removed from the short limitation clause than those adverted to in the above examples ; for it is <em>founded in contract, </em>and is <em>given by the common law ; </em>whereas they are purely <em>statutory </em>remedies.</p>\n<p data-order=\"30\" data-type=\"legal\" id=\"b145-7\"><em>Third. </em>The provision in 2 <em>R. S. </em>298, \u00a7 31, was intended to \u25a0 embrace only actions for <em>penalties </em>and <em>forfeitures, </em>properly so called, and other actions of the <em>like nature.</em></p>\n<p data-order=\"31\" data-type=\"legal\" id=\"b145-8\">1. The subject matter which the legislature had in view, when they adopted the provisions in <em>Art. 3d, </em>of which the-above section is a part, was, actions <em>ion penalties and forfeitures. </em>This they have expressly declared. <em>(See </em>2 <em>R. S. </em>291-2, \u00a7 1, <em>Tit. </em>1; 2 <em>R. S. </em>295, <em>caption of Art. 2; 2 R.

The section was introduced mainly to provide for the case of a penalty or forfeiture given to the <em>party aggrieved, </em>which was not embraced by the preceding sections of <em>Art. 3d. (See Greenl. Laws of N. Y. </em>96 ; 4 <em>Mod. </em>129 ; <em>Cro. Eliz. </em>645; <em>Noy, </em>71; 3 <em>Leon. </em>237.)</p>\n<p data-order=\"34\" data-type=\"legal\" id=\"b145-11\">3. The word \u201c <em>cause \u201d </em>was substituted in this section for the word <em>\u201cpenalty,\u201d </em>used in the preceding ones, from a doubt <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"130\">*130</page-number>whether a statute giving a sum of money or damages, both by way of <em>remedy </em>to the plaintiff, and <em>punishment </em>to the defendant, could rightly be called a \u201c statute made, &amp;c., for a <em>penalty,\u201d </em>learned judges having differed upon the question. <em>(Espinasse on Penal Actions, pp. </em>6 <em>to </em>8; <em>Hardwick\u2019s Rep. </em>390, 393, <em>Merrick </em>v. <em>The Hundred, </em>&amp;c.; 1 <em>Wilson\u2019s Rep. </em>125, 6, <em>Williams </em>v. <em>Middleton </em>; 2 <em>Term Rep. </em>154; 8 <em>Johns. Rep. </em>345; 14 <em>Johns. Rep. </em>255 ; 13 <em>W. </em>265 ; 3 <em>Toml. Law Did. </em>520.)</p>\n<p data-order=\"35\" data-type=\"legal\" id=\"b146-4\">Some judges say, penalty\u2014some not\u2014some say in the nature of a penalty. \u00abJggf</p>\n<p data-order=\"36\" data-type=\"legal\" id=\"b146-5\">4. By using the word \u201c cause,\u201d in the unlimited sense ascribed to it by the supreme court, the word \u201c forfeiture \u201d is rendered entirely inoperative. But the legislature having expressly declared that the subject matter intended to be provided for was actions for penalties and forfeitures, the word \u201c <em>cause,\u201d </em>being general and of doubtful import, is to be limited and applied accordingly. (1 <em>Blackst. Comm. </em>60, 61; 1 <em>Plowden\u2019s Rep. </em>203-206.)</p>\n<p data-order=\"37\" data-type=\"legal\" id=\"b146-6\">5. Again, the word <em>u cause,\u201d </em>being preceded by the word <em>\u201cforfeiture,\u201d </em>is to be understood as meaning something of the <em>like nature, </em>according to the maxim <em>noscitur a sociis. </em>Construed in this way, the section will read : \u201c All actions upon any statute made, or to be made, for any forfeiture or <em>like cause,\u201d </em>&amp;c. <em>(See Broom\u2019s Legal Max. </em>294-5; 5 <em>Barn &amp; Ald. </em>164, <em>Phillips </em>v. <em>Barber ; </em>4 <em>Term Rep. </em>224, 227, <em>Evans </em>v. <em>Stevens ; </em>2 <em>Moore </em>491, 495, <em>Clark </em>v. <em>Gaskarth ; </em>8 <em>Taunt. </em>431, <em>S. C.) </em>)g5gr= Constitution supreme court strikes out the word <em>forfeiture.</em></p>\n<p data-order=\"38\" data-type=\"legal\" id=\"b146-8\">6. This construction harmonizes with the popular and true meaning of the words \u201c <em>party aggrieved,\u201d </em>which are never used except in reference to one who has suffered from some <em>tortious </em>act or omission of another.</p>\n<p data-order=\"39\" data-type=\"legal\" id=\"b146-9\"><em>Fourth. </em>The action is embraced by that part of the statute limiting the right of suing to six years. (2 <em>R. S. </em>295, \u00a7 18; 3 <em>R. S. </em>102, <em>Reviser\u2019s Motes.)</em></p>\n<p data-order=\"40\" data-type=\"legal\" id=\"b146-11\">1. It is within the express terms of the 4th subdivision of the above section; being an action of \u201c <em>assumpsit, </em>or <em>on the case, </em>founded on a <em>contract </em>or <em>liability, </em>express or <em>implied.\u201d</em></p>\n<p data-order=\"41\" data-type=\"legal\" id=\"b147-4\"><page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"131\">*131</page-number>. 2. None of the reasons which induced the legislature to prescribe a short period of limitation for <em>punitory </em>or <em>penal </em>actions apply to this case. It is an action upon a demand for goods sold, and is entitled to as much favor as other actions of the same general character. (20 <em>Wend. </em>614, <em>ex parte Van Riper.)</em></p>\n<p data-order=\"42\" data-type=\"legal\" id=\"b147-5\">3. If the supreme court are right, however, the action would be barred absolutely after <em>three </em>years, and the plaintiff would be entitled to none of the exceptions on account of disability, absence from the state, &amp;e., which apply to other actions of assumpsit, and even of <em>tort. (See </em>2 <em>R. 8. </em>296, 7, \u00a7\u00a7 24, 26, 27; 2 <em>R. S. </em>298, \u00a7 32.)</p>\n<p data-order=\"43\" data-type=\"legal\" id=\"b147-6\"><em>Fifth. </em>If it be doubtful, upon a view of the whole scheme of legislation on this subject, whether the <em>three </em>years\u2019 limitation, or the <em>six, </em>is applicable to actions like the present, that construction should be adopted which will preserve the remedy the longest. <em>(Blanchard Limit. </em>2-4.)</p>\n<p data-order=\"44\" data-type=\"legal\" id=\"b147-7\">1. By the common law, a suitor had an <em>unlimited </em>time within which to sue, the maxim being that \u201c a right never dies.\u2019\u2019 <em>(Wilkinson on Lim. </em>1, 2.)</p>\n<p data-order=\"45\" data-type=\"legal\" id=\"b147-8\">2. The \u201c statute of limitations, being in restraint of right, is to be construed strictly;\u201d i. e. so as to <em>continue </em>and <em>preserve </em>the right, rather than to <em>abridge </em>or <em>destroy </em>it. (14 <em>Johns. Rep. </em>480, <em>per Van Ness, J.; </em>2 <em>Bos. </em>&amp; <em>Pull. </em>546-7, <em>per Heath, J.)</em></p>\n<p data-order=\"46\" data-type=\"legal\" id=\"b147-9\">3. \u201c The better construction of a statute is always to expound it as near the rules of the common law as may be.\u201d (11 <em>Mod. Rep. </em>150, <em>Arthur </em>v. <em>Bokenham ; </em>1 <em>Saund. Rep. </em>240; 10 <em>Johns.

The language of the six years\u2019 limitation (2 <em>R. S. p. </em>296, <em>sec. </em>18, <em>sub. 1,2d ed. p. </em>224) plainly embraces the cause of action in this case, it being debt on \u201c <em>a liability not under seal.\u201d</em></p>\n<p data-order=\"57\" data-type=\"legal\" id=\"b148-11\">2. The former statute was different, omitting the words \u201c <em>liability not under seal;\u201d (see Laws </em>1813, <em>p. </em>186;) and under the <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"133\">*133</page-number><em>former </em>statute, the cause of action in the present case was apparently not embraced in the six years\u2019 limitation.</p>\n<p data-order=\"58\" data-type=\"legal\" id=\"b149-5\">8. The case of Van Hook v. Whitlock (2 <em>Edwards Chan. Rep. </em>304; 3 <em>Paige Rep. </em>409; 7 <em>Paige Rep. </em>373 ; 26 <em>Wend. </em>43) arose under the <em>former </em>statute. Hence it is plainly no authority here. The whole argument in support of the view of the statute of limitations, taken by the chancellor in that case, was founded, on the want of language in the old statute which would enable the court to apply the six years\u2019 limitation.</p>\n<p data-order=\"59\" data-type=\"legal\" id=\"b149-6\">But the chancellor expressly saidf in that very case, (3 <em>Paige </em>416,) that under the <em>Revised Statutes </em>the six years\u2019 limitation would apply.</p>\n<p data-order=\"60\" data-type=\"legal\" id=\"b149-7\">But in fact that case can be held to establish nothing on the question, as it finally was decided on other grounds, and the doctrine now claimed to be supported by it, was in the final decision repudiated. <em>(Van Hook </em>v.

Under a similar statute to our former statute, the English courts have held that twenty years\u2019 limitation only applied to causes of action founded on statute. <em>(Jones </em>v. Pope, 1 <em>Saund. </em>36, 37, <em>in notes ; see also Bell </em>v. Bullard, 1 <em>Mason, </em>243; 1 <em>Chit. Pl. </em>120; <em>Pease </em>v. <em>Howard, </em>14 <em>Johns. </em>480.)</p>\n<p data-order=\"62\" data-type=\"legal\" id=\"b149-9\">5. It appears that the change in the phraseology of the statute was made for the purpose of applying the six years\u2019 limitation to cases like this. <em>(See notes of Revisers, </em>3 <em>R. S., 2d ed., </em>702.)</p>\n<p data-order=\"63\" data-type=\"legal\" id=\"b149-10\"><em>Second. </em>The three years\u2019 limitation (2 <em>R. S. </em>2 <em>ed. </em>225, <em>sec. </em>31; <em>1st ed. </em>298) is, in its language, its spirit, and its policy, only applicable to actions for penalties and forfeitures, and things in the nature of penalties and forfeitures.</p>\n<p data-order=\"64\" data-type=\"legal\" id=\"b149-11\">This is all substantially declared in the title of the article in which the section in question is contained, and in the index of reference to this particular section, and in the general index. <em>(And see the opinion of Nelson, C. </em>J., <em>in Van Hook </em>v. <em>Whitlock, </em>26 <em>Wend. </em>51-53.)</p>\n<p data-order=\"65\" data-type=\"legal\" id=\"b149-12\">And clearly, upon all the received rules of construction, every word in the section must be kept within the scope of the declared subject matter of the article, and must be construed so as to assimilate and harmonize with the context.</p>\n<p data-order=\"66\" data-type=\"legal\" id=\"b149-13\"><em>Third. </em>There is nothing in the cause of action in the present <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"134\">*134</page-number>case in the nature of a penalty or forfeiture. It springs solely from contract. <em>(Bronson, J., .in Moss </em>v. <em>Oakley, 2 Hill, </em>268-270; <em>Cowen, J., in Moss </em>v. <em>McCullough, </em>5 <em>Hill, </em>131; <em>Hopkins </em>v. <em>Haywood, </em>13 <em>Wend. </em>265, <em>and see fifth point and cases cited.)</em></p>\n<p data-order=\"67\" data-type=\"legal\" id=\"b150-4\"><em>Fourth. </em>The judgment below cannot, it is conceded, be sustained, unless by establishing the broad rule that all actions, of whatever nature, founded on statutes, are barred in three years. An examination of various statutory provisions, by which alone certain actions can.be sustained, will make it manifest that such a rule was never in the intention of the legislature, and must prevent the recognition of such a rule.</p>\n<p data-order=\"68\" data-type=\"legal\" id=\"b150-5\">The action for use and occupation of land is given by statute, (1 <em>R. S. </em>748, <em>sec. </em>26; <em>Id. 2d ed. </em>739,) and would not lie but for the statute, without an express promise. <em>(Smith </em>v. <em>Stewart, </em>6 <em>Johns. R. </em>48; <em>Chit. Pl., Springfield ed. of </em>1833, <em>p. </em>120.)</p>\n<p data-order=\"69\" data-type=\"legal\" id=\"b150-6\">See also section 27 of same statute, (1 <em>R. S. </em>748,) which is for a penalty, and no doubt subject to the three years\u2019 limitation. (Be<em>ardsley, J., in Wood </em>v. <em>Wilcox, </em>1 <em>Denio, </em>38; <em>and in Cleves </em>v. <em>Willoughby, </em>7 <em>Hill, </em>86, 87.)</p>\n<p data-order=\"70\" data-type=\"legal\" id=\"b150-7\">By endorsee in his own name against maker. <em>(Stat. 3d and 4th Anne, ch. </em>9, <em>sec. </em>1; 11 <em>Pick.
