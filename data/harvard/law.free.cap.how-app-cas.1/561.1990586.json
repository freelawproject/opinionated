Gautier, by a certain other instrument, bearing date on the ninth day of March, in the year one thousand eight hundred and twenty-nine, did authorize me to reimburse myself certain moneys out of the surplus proceeds of the said premises, as by the said deed of assignment and other instrument may appear. Now I do hereby devise to my executors,- and to their heirs and assigns;, as joint tenants, and not as tenants in common, all my estate and interest in the said lands and premises, legal as well as equitable.</summary>\n<summary data-order=\"15\" data-type=\"summary\" id=\"b580-5\"><em>Item. </em>I nominate and appoint my brother Benjamin Stagg, and my son John Town Stagg, executors and trustees of this will.</summary>\n<summary data-order=\"16\" data-type=\"summary\" id=\"b580-6\"><em>Item. </em>I-f only one of my executors should survive me, or if only one of them should prove this will and take on himself the execution thereof, then, and in either of these cases, I give and devise to the executor who' shall take on himself the-execution of this will, and to his heirs and assigns, the same estate, real and personal, which I have above devised to my executors, and with the' powers and on the same trusts.</summary>\n<summary data-order=\"17\" data-type=\"summary\" id=\"b580-7\">John T. Stagg, in June, 1835, took upon himself the burden of the execution of the will. James Jackson and Mary E. his wife\u2014the latter being the daughter, devisee, legatee, and one of the heirs at law of the testator\u2014filed their petition before David B. Ogden, Esq., surrogate of the city and county of New-York, praying that the said John T. Stagg might be compelled to account with and pay over to the different parties in interest the shares due to each from the said estate.</summary>\n<summary data-order=\"18\" data-type=\"summary\" id=\"b581-4\"><page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"565\">*565</page-number>On the 27th of July, 1843, the surrogate made an order that the executor render his account on or before the 20th of August next, (1843,) and that the hearing thereon be adjourned to the first Tuesday of September, 1843.</summary>\n<summary data-order=\"19\" data-type=\"summary\" id=\"b581-5\">The executor rendered and filed his account, under oath, of the <em>personal estate </em>only, showing a balance in his hands of $2,835.75. The respondents, Jackson and wife, excepted to the account, and charged that no vouchers were produced for the debits and credits in the account, so that the correctness thereof could be admitted or objected to; and that the following items were objected to as improper, (naming some twelve different items amounting to about $250.) That no interest was allowed in said account to the estate. That the testator, at the time of his death, was seized of the moiety of the stores Nos. 185 and 187 Washington-street, in the city of New-York-; and that the rents accruing from the same were not credited in the said account: that the interest of said testator in said stores was, after his death, sold as directed by the last will and testament of the testator, and that the proceeds of the sale were not accounted for in said account rendered.</summary>\n<summary data-order=\"20\" data-type=\"summary\" id=\"b581-6\">That the other real estate, of which the testator died seized, had been sold as directed by said will, but that the proceeds had not been accounted for by said executor.</summary>\n<summary data-order=\"21\" data-type=\"summary\" id=\"b581-7\">The answer of John T. Stagg, the executor, averred that the account he had rendered was just and true, and that he was ready to verify the same, and to substantiate by proofs and vouchers the items in said account, according to law.</summary>\n<summary data-order=\"22\" data-type=\"summary\" id=\"b581-8\">And further, that no interest was due to said Jackson and wife from the executor, because he had already paid them, before the citation issued, an amount far exceeding the share or proportion due to the wife, Mary E. Jackson, from the personal estate of the testator.</summary>\n<summary data-order=\"23\" data-type=\"summary\" id=\"b581-9\">And denied the right, at law, claimed by the respondents, to have or demand any amount of the rents, issues, and profits, or the avails of the real estate sold, whereof the testator died seized, and demurred to such claims and demands, as in said account of said James Jackson and Mary E., his wife, required, <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"566\">*566</page-number>because, he said, they were not within the jurisdiction of the surrogate\u2019s court, nor could the settlement thereof be legally adjudicated before said surrogate.</summary>\n<summary data-order=\"24\" data-type=\"summary\" id=\"b582-4\">To this answer and demurrer the respondents filed a replication and joinder.</summary>\n<summary data-order=\"25\" data-type=\"summary\" id=\"b582-5\">The surrogate, after argument of the cause on the 24th Nov., 1843, overruled the demurrer of John T. Stagg, the executor, and ordered that he proceed with the further accounting, and that he produce the vouchers for the debts and credits in his account before rendered, exhibiting the particulars thereof; and that he account for the rents and profits of the real estate of which the testator died seized, as well as for the proceeds realized from the sale of the said real estate, after the decease of the testator, and that he file said account, duly verified, with the vouchers, in the surrogate\u2019s office on or before 15th Dec., 1843; and that the executor submit himself to an examination on oath touching any property or effects of the deceased which had come to his hands, and the disposition thereof, or in default of compliance with the order, an attachment issue against said executor. The question of the liability of the executor to allow' interest on the property and effects which had come to his hands was reserved until further accounting was had.</summary>\n<summary data-order=\"26\" data-type=\"summary\" id=\"b582-6\">John T. Stagg, the executor, appealed from the v'hole of this decree, except that part relating to the personal estate, which would and ought to be included in the inventory of the personal estate of the testator by his acting executor to the chancellor.</summary>\n<summary data-order=\"27\" data-type=\"summary\" id=\"b582-7\">On the 23d of February, 1847, the chancellor affirmed the decree of the surrogate, appealed from, \"with costs to be paid by the executor; and decreed that the respondents, by reason of said appeal, as and for damages for the delay and vexation thereof, recover against the appellant interest on the balance which was due them from the appellant as executor on the 23d Dec., 1843, including in such balance such interest as the respondents were then entitled to upon their share of the funds in the hands of the appellant, from the time when he ought to have paid it over to them, or invested it for their use; and that <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"567\">*567</page-number>for the purpose of ascertaining and giving to the respondents such damages, the surrogate of the city of New-York, to whom the proceedings were to be remitted, was directed to state the account of said appellant, with a rest on the said 23d day of December, 1843, and to charge the appellant, executor as aforesaid, with interest from that time upon the balance which was then due from him to the respondents for the principal and interest, with which the appellant was then chargeable for the share of -the proceeds of the real estate of the decedent, Abraham Stagg, and of the rents, interest, and income thereof.</summary>\n<summary data-order=\"28\" data-type=\"summary\" id=\"b583-5\">From the decree of the chancellor, John T. Stagg, the executor, brought an appeal to this court.</summary>\n<attorneys data-order=\"29\" data-type=\"attorneys\" id=\"b583-6\">\n<em>Silvanus Miller, Attorney, and</em>\n</attorneys>\n<attorneys data-order=\"30\" data-type=\"attorneys\" id=\"b583-7\"><em>Henry E. Davies, Counsel, </em>for appellant.</attorneys>\n<p data-order=\"31\" data-type=\"legal\" id=\"b583-8\"><em>First. </em>The surrogate\u2019s court, by its original constitution, have no concern with, nor jurisdiction over, real estate.</p>\n<p data-order=\"32\" data-type=\"legal\" id=\"b583-9\"><em>Second. </em>Whatever jurisdiction over real property it at present possesses is derived exclusively from statutory enactments, which, being in derogation of the common law courts, must be strictly construed. <em>(Dakin </em>v. <em>Hudson, </em>6 <em>Cowen, </em>221; <em>Bloom </em>v. <em>Burdick, </em>1 <em>Hill, </em>139; 4 <em>T. R. </em>107.)</p>\n<p data-order=\"33\" data-type=\"legal\" id=\"b583-10\"><em>Third. </em>If the surrogate\u2019s court has any jurisdiction over the subject matter of this-suit, it is derived from the following clause of the revised statutes, viz.</p>\n<p data-order=\"34\" data-type=\"legal\" id=\"b583-11\">\u201c When by any last will, a sale of real estate shall be ordered to be made, either for the payment of debts or legacies, the surrogate, in whose office such will was proved, shall have power to cite the executors in such'will named, to account for the proceeds of the sales, and to compel distribution thereof; and to make all necessary orders and decrees thereon, with the like power of enforcing them, as if the said proceeds had been originally personal property of the deceased in the hands of an administrator.\u201d (2 <em>Rev. Statutes, p. </em>110, \u00a7 57.)</p>\n<p data-order=\"35\" data-type=\"legal\" id=\"b583-12\">Will don\u2019t <em>order </em>estate sold\u2014only gives power. \u2022 This is a <em>devise, </em>not a <em>legacy.

The real estate to his executors upon trust, to sell all or any part of the trust estate, whenever they shall see fit\u2014thus leaving the selling of the real estate entirely at the option of the executors.</p>\n<p data-order=\"38\" data-type=\"legal\" id=\"b584-6\">2. It authorizes the trustees to lease and demise any part of the trust estate, for life, or lives, or for years.</p>\n<p data-order=\"39\" data-type=\"legal\" id=\"b584-7\">3. Then after two small annuities, the will directs the division of the trust estate into nine parts; and the payment or conveyance of one part to testator\u2019s daughter, Anna Matilda; one other part to a daughter, Mary Elizabeth; one other part to a son, John; and the holding of another part in trust for a daughter, Hannah Augusta, upon certain trusts; and the five remaining shares to be held for the fi-ve minor children of testator respectively, subject to contingencies, and going over to other persons, on the happening of certain events.</p>\n<p data-order=\"40\" data-type=\"legal\" id=\"b584-8\"><em>Fifth. </em>It must be observed that, under this will, there are two devises of the real estate, viz.:\u2014</p>\n<p data-order=\"41\" data-type=\"legal\" id=\"b584-9\">1. It is optional with the executors whether to sell or not; and if they do not sell, or until they do sell, the <em>rents and profits </em>are to be received and passed over to certain persons. This is a clear <em>devise, </em>and not a legacy.</p>\n<p data-order=\"42\" data-type=\"legal\" id=\"b584-10\">It is not an \u201c incident \u201d to the direction, because it is not connected with the direction, nor .necessary for its execution;' but is entirely .independent of it, neither advancing, nor retarding, nor aiding, nor in any way qualifying the sale.</p>\n<p data-order=\"43\" data-type=\"legal\" id=\"b584-11\">It is entirely optional with the executors whether they will sell or not. They may never sell. This provision, so far from being an incident to the direction to sell, is made as a substitute, in case the direction is never followed, or during such indefinite time as it shall remain unexecuted.</p>\n<p data-order=\"44\" data-type=\"legal\" id=\"b584-12\">The appellant demurs specially on the ground that the surrogate has no jurisdiction to call him to account for the rents, issues, and profits of the real estate. <em>(Vide demurrer case, p. </em>17.) And the surrogate by his decree orders him to account for those <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"569\">*569</page-number>rents and profits, <em>{case, p. </em>7,) and such order is confirmed by the chancellor\u2019s decree, <em>{case, pi </em>28.)</p>\n<p data-order=\"45\" data-type=\"legal\" id=\"b585-5\">If this is a devise, then the surrogate has no jurisdiction, and the two decrees are clearly erroneous.</p>\n<p data-order=\"46\" data-type=\"legal\" id=\"b585-6\">2. As to the proceeds of the sale, the executor was not liable to account before the surrogate.</p>\n<p data-order=\"47\" data-type=\"legal\" id=\"b585-7\">(1.) In this case the lands are not ordered to be sold, as is the case in which the statute gives the surrogate jurisdiction.</p>\n<p data-order=\"48\" data-type=\"legal\" id=\"b585-8\">The will creates a trust, leaving it to the trustee to sell or not as he shall deem best. He is liable to be called to account in equity as a trustee, but the land is certainly not <em>ordered to be </em>sold.</p>\n<p data-order=\"49\" data-type=\"legal\" id=\"b585-9\">(2.) The executor may, if he chooses, divide the real estate, giving to each of the final devisees a ninth part, and accounting to \"each for a ninth part of the rents and profits, certain parts being contingent, and to be retained by said executors till the contingency occurs; or he may, if he chooses, sell the estate, and make a similar division and appropriation of the proceeds: all this shows a case of trustee and <em>cestui que trust, </em>and a case in which the executor will be held accountable in equity. But it is submitted that it does' not show a case coming within the 57th section of the revised statutes, quoted above.</p>\n<p data-order=\"50\" data-type=\"legal\" id=\"b585-10\"><em>Sixth. </em>The chancellor\u2019s decree ordering compound interest to be paid, by directing a rest to be made on the 23d December, 1843, ought to be reversed, as the appeal was for reasonable cause, and the case is not one in which damages should be awarded for delay and vexation. .</p>\n<p data-order=\"51\" data-type=\"legal\" id=\"b585-11\">SsT\u00b0 Act of 1837 confers no authority to <em>compel </em>the bringing the money into court. \u201cH3U</p>\n<attorneys data-order=\"52\" data-type=\"attorneys\" id=\"b585-12\"><em>Woodruff </em>&amp; <em>Goodman, Attorneys, and</em></attorneys>\n<attorneys data-order=\"53\" data-type=\"attorneys\" id=\"b585-13\"><em>L. B. Woodruff, Counsel, </em>for respondents.</attorneys>\n<p data-order=\"54\" data-type=\"legal\" id=\"b585-14\"><em>First. </em>By the provisions of his will the entire property of the testator, real and personal, was blended in one common fund\u2014real estate to be converted into money, and the whole, together with the income thereof, to be applied to the payment of debts and legacies, and be divided among his children.</p>\n<p data-order=\"55\" data-type=\"legal\" id=\"b586-3\"><page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"570\">*570</page-number>1. This amounted to a conversion of the real estate into personalty <em>at the death of the testator, </em>upon the doctrine of equitable conversion.</p>\n<p data-order=\"56\" data-type=\"legal\" id=\"b586-4\">2. This would be true, even if there had been no devise of the legal estate, but only a power to sell, &amp;c., to pay debts and legacies, &amp;e. <em>(Ram on Assets, p. </em>139, [205,] <em>and cases cited; </em>2 <em>Row. on Dev. p. </em>60, <em>and onward ; Leigh </em>&amp; <em>Dalzell on Eq. </em>Conversion, 5 <em>Law Library, 1st series; Marsh </em>v. <em>Wheeler, </em>2 <em>Edw.

The -powers conferred by the will appertain to John T. Stagg, in his representative character, <em>i. e. </em>as executor.</p>\n<p data-order=\"59\" data-type=\"legal\" id=\"b586-7\">2. And upon the principle that whatever goes to the executor <em>as executor </em>is legal assets, both the income before a sale and the proceeds after sale are deemed legal assets in his hands.

And the trusts created for the protection of the minor children and grandchildren of the testator do not impair the respondents\u2019 right to treat the moneys received by the executor as legal assets, received for their use.</p>\n<p data-order=\"62\" data-type=\"legal\" id=\"b586-10\"><em>Fourth. </em>Real estate, when <em>converted </em>into money for the payment of debts and legacies and distribution, is not only legal <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"571\">*571</page-number>and personal assets in the hands of the executor, but is to be accounted for before the surrogate.</p>\n<p data-order=\"63\" data-type=\"legal\" id=\"b587-5\">1. The statute is explicit in regard to proceeds of sales.</p>\n<p data-order=\"64\" data-type=\"legal\" id=\"b587-6\">2. There is no foundation for any distinction between the rents <em>collected </em>before the sale and the money received on the sale; both are the result of the conversion contemplated by the will.</p>\n<p data-order=\"65\" data-type=\"legal\" id=\"b587-7\">3. The accounting must therefore be <em>as executor. </em>(2 Rev. <em>Stat. p. </em>24, [82,] \u00a7 6; <em>do. p. </em>47, [109,110,] \u00a7\u00a7 55, 57, 61; <em>do. p. </em>32, [92,J \u00a7\u00a7 52,53; <em>do. p. </em>30, [90,] \u00a7\u00a7 45,48; <em>do. p. </em>52, [116,] \u00a7\u00a7 18,19; <em>Bogert </em>v. <em>Hertell, </em>4 <em>Hill, </em>492; <em>Toller on Exrs. p. </em>413, <em>and onward ; Sess. Laws, </em>1837, <em>ch. </em>460, <em>p. </em>537.)</p>\n<p data-order=\"66\" data-type=\"attorneys\" id=\"b587-8\"><em>Fifth. </em>The order appealed from is not erroneous.</p>\n<p data-order=\"67\" data-type=\"legal\" id=\"b587-9\">1. The appeal should be dismissed, with costs to be paid by the executor <em>personally, </em>and not of the estate.</p>\n<p data-order=\"68\" data-type=\"legal\" id=\"b587-10\">2. Damages should be awarded to the respondents for the delay and vexation caused by the appeal from the court of chancery.</p>\n<p data-order=\"69\" data-type=\"legal\" id=\"b587-11\">There is nothing meritorious in the objections by the executor to the order appealed from. The nature of these objections\u2014 the previous decision of the court of chancery upon the appellant\u2019s own application in regard to this estate, acquiesced in by him, and the lapse of <em>twelve </em>years, during which the executor has held this estate in his own hands\u2014all show that this appeal is taken for the mere purpose of vexation and delay, while the executor retains the money for his private use and benefit.
