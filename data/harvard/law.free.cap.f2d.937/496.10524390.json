ANDERSON, Circuit Judge.</author>\n<p id=\"b596-25\">It is now settled that the weight of the carrier medium \u2014 in this case blotter paper impregnated with lysergic acid diethyla-mide (LSD) \u2014 is \u201cincluded when determining the appropriate sentence for trafficking in LSD.\u201d <em>Chapman v. United States, </em>\u2014 U.S.-, 111 S.Ct. 1919, 1929, 114 L.Ed.2d 524 (1991); <em>see United States v. Larsen, </em>904 F.2d 562 (10th Cir.1990). <em>Chapman </em>and <em>Larsen </em>keyed on the provisions of 21 U.S.C. \u00a7\u00a7 841(b)(1)(A)(v) and (B)(v) which impose minimum and maximum sentences based upon specified weights of a \u201cmixture or substance\u201d containing a detectable amount of LSD.<footnotemark>1</footnotemark> Subparagraph (C) of \u00a7 841(b)(1), which includes violations involving less than one gram of LSD, does not contain the \u201cmixture or substance\u201d language of (A)(v) and (B)(v).<footnotemark>2</footnotemark> The question <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"497\">*497</page-number>posed to us in this case is whether the omission of \u201cmixture or substance\u201d language in \u00a7 841(b)(1)(C) means that the weight of blotter paper carrying LSD may not be included in determining the sentence for trafficking in LSD in quantities insufficient to fall within \u00a7 841(b)(l)(A)(v) and (B)(v). Because the United States Sentencing Commission Guidelines Manual (1990) (\u201cU.S.S.G.\u201d or \u201cSentencing Guidelines\u201d) applies the \u201cmixture or substance\u201d language to all quantities of LSD in determining the base offense level for sentencing purposes, U.S.S.G. \u00a7 2Dl.l(c) n.*, we hold that the weight of the blotter paper carrying the LSD is properly included, and affirm the sentence imposed on the defendant by the district court.</p>\n<p id=\"b597-4\">Tony Dean Leazenby pled guilty to knowingly and intentionally distributing LSD, specifically 40 dosage units carried in blotter papers, in violation of 21 U.S.C. \u00a7 841(a)(1). The drug and blotter paper combined weighed .24 grams (240 mg.). The parties agree for purposes of this case that the drug alone weighed 2 mg. <em>See </em>U.S.S.G. \u00a7 2D1.1, comment, (n. 11) (typical weight per unit of LSD, without regard to the mixture or substance with which it is combined, is .05 mg.). The combined weight of the drug and blotter paper established an offense level of 18. U.S.S.G. \u00a7 2Dl.l(c)(13). The offense level was reduced to 16 for defendant\u2019s acceptance of responsibility. U.S.S.G. \u00a7 3E1.1. Based upon Leazenby\u2019s criminal history category of III, the resulting sentencing range was 27 to 33 months. Leazenby was sentenced to 27 months in prison. The Sentencing Guidelines would have yielded a possible sentence of 15 to 21 months if the weight of the drug alone had been used.</p>\n<p id=\"b597-5\">Leazenby argues that Congress has not expressed an intent to include the weight of the blotter paper carrier in determining punishment for defendants \u201ccharged\u201d under 21 U.S.C. \u00a7 841(b)(1)(C) and \u00a7 812(c)-Sehedule 1(c). That is so he argues because the substance of the provisions now contained in subparagraph (C) of \u00a7 841(b)(1) was enacted into law as part of the Comprehensive Drug Abuse Prevention and Control Act of 1970, Pub.L. 91-513, 84 Stat. 1236, whereas it was not until 1986 that \u201cCongress adopted a \u2018market-oriented\u2019 approach to punishing drug trafficking, under which the total quantity of what is distributed, rather than the amount of pure drug involved, is used to determine the length of the sentence.\u201d <em>Chapman v. United States, </em>\u2014 U.S. at-, 111 S.Ct. at 1925 (referring to the Anti-Drug Abuse Act of 1986, Pub.L. 99-570, 100 Stat. 3207). The 1986 Act added subparagraphs (A) and (B), and reenacted former subparagraph (A) as (C), Pub.L. 99-570, \u00a7 1002, but did not insert in subparagraph (C) the \u201cmixture or substance\u201d language contained in sub-paragraphs (A) and (B). Leazenby argues that \u201cbecause the statute under which [he] is charged is silent on the question of whether the weight of the drug includes the blotter paper, the law should be construed in his favor and the weight of the drug alone considered for sentencing under this statute for purposes of the Guidelines.\u201d Appellant\u2019s Brief at 5.</p>\n<p id=\"b597-9\">That misconceives the point. Leazenby was not \u201ccharged\u201d under section (b)(1)(C). He was charged for violating 21 U.S.C. \u00a7 841(a)(1). And, he was not sentenced under \u00a7 841(b)(1)(C). He was sentenced pursuant to the Sentencing Guidelines. Section 841(b) sets only minimum and maximum punishments, none of which apply here. It does not otherwise affect the Sentencing Guidelines.</p>\n<p id=\"b597-10\">The Sentencing Guidelines require the carrier medium to be used in determining the weight of LSD for offense level purposes. Footnote * to the Drug Quantity Table of U.S.S.G. 2Dl.l(c) states: \u201cUnless otherwise specified, the weight of a controlled substance set forth in the table refers to the entire weight of any mixture or substance containing a detectable amount of the controlled substance.\u201d Application Note 1 to \u00a7 2D1.1 states that the term \u201cmixture or substance\u201d has the same meaning as in 21 U.S.C. \u00a7 841, and that meaning, as <em>Chapman </em>makes clear, includes the weight of the carrier medium. \u201cNone of the references to purity in the guidelines makes sense if the weights in the statute deal with pure drugs to start <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"498\">*498</page-number>with.\u201d <em>United States v. Marshall, </em>908 F.2d 1312, 1319 (7th Cir.1990) (en banc), <em>aff'd sub nom. Chapman v. United States, </em>\u2014 U.S.-, 111 S.Ct. 1919, 114 L.Ed.2d 524. Finally, it is undisputed that the sentencing court must apply \u201cthe offense level specified in the Drug Quantity Table,\u201d U.S. S.G. \u00a7 2D1.1(a)(3), with exceptions not relevant here.</p>\n<p id=\"b598-6\">The proper question here is whether the Sentencing Guidelines include the weight of the carrier medium with which LSD is combined \u2014 here, blotter paper \u2014 in determining the base offense level. In view of the Supreme Court\u2019s decision in <em>Chapman, </em>and the clear language of the Sentencing Guidelines we hold that the weight of the carrier medium is included. The judgment of the district court is AFFIRMED.</p>\n<footnote label=\"1\">\n<p id=\"b596-14\">.
