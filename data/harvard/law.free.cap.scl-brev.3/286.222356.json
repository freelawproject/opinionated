An action of trespass was brought by the plaintiff, against the defendants, and tried before Brevard, J. in the district court of Marlborough. The declaration alleged, that that the defendants, with force and arms, took and carried away a slave of the plain, tiff; to which the defendants pleaded not guilty, and a justification, that the slave in question, was the proper slave of one of the deffen, dants. On which, issues were taken to the country.</summary>\n<summary data-order=\"6\" data-type=\"summary\" id=\"b294-14\">The slave in question, as it appeared in evidence, was pledged to the defendant, Mandeville, or placed in his hands upon a verbal contract; the terms of which were, that, in consideration of a cer. tain sum ot money advanced by the latter to the former, the slave should be considered as sold and delivered by the former to the latter, upon a condition, or proviso, agreed upon between them, at the same time, that if the said sum of money should be returned, on or before a certain day mentioned, and stipulated, then and in that case, the sale should be considered void, and the slave returned tq the plaintiff. The money was not returned at, or before the day appointed for that purpose, but was tendered sometime afterwards, and within two years after breach of the proviso aforesaid. The motion to this court was founded upon an alleged misconstruction of' the 15th section of the limitation act of 1712, P. L. 103; an\u00e1 misdirection of the judge to the jury upon the trial.</summary>\n<summary data-order=\"7\" data-type=\"summary\" id=\"b295-4\"><page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"287\">*287</page-number>The counsel for the plaintiff contended, at the trial, that the act in question entitled the plaintiff to redeem the slave mortgaged, or pawned, as aforesaid, at any time within two years after the breach of the condition : and, the defendants\u2019 counsel insisted, that the act <em>' </em>Cannot be construed to relate to verbal sales with condition, but to such only as are reduced into writing, and must b\u00e9 confined to <em>bills of sale, </em>by way of mortgage, according to the express words of the act.</summary>\n<summary data-order=\"8\" data-type=\"summary\" id=\"b295-7\">The court, at tho trial, .gave this construction to the act ire question, and directed the jury accordingly, viz: that, by are equitable construction, although the words used are, \u201cbills of sale, &amp;c.\u201d; yet, such an interpretation ought to be given, as will extend tho provisions of the act to all cases coming within the <em>same mischief; </em>and, therefore, that verbal sales, of a like nature, with benefit of redemption, ought to be considered on a fooling with sales of a similar description, reduced to writing. As to the limitation of two years, relied on by the plaintiff\u2019s cou .se!, it was construed to intend a limitation of the equiiy of redemption, and not as intended to afford any benefit to the pawnor, or morigagor, ot redeeming, by payment, or tender, of the money borrowed or stipulated, after breach of the proviso, or condition agreed on. The court was of opinion, that the words, \u201cand shall continue in possession for the space of two years after breach of the proviso, without redemption, \u2014 although with right or equity of redemption, \u2014 to he vested in the mortgagee absolutely, &amp;c.\u201d plainly signify that the design of the legislature was to limit the prosecution of <em>suits in equity, </em>for the redemption of property so situated, alter breach of the Conditions of such sale ; and, to coi fiim the title of the pawnee, or mortgagee, and save the expense of a suit in equity to foreclose : and, that this design, or intention of the legislature, appears further manifested by the words used in the saving part of the same clause, saving to married women, and ,.ersons beyond sea, their <em>equity of </em>redemption, so as they prosecute <em>the same </em>within three years after breach of the proviso. The same intention might also be iiifeired, from the general scope of the whole act; and, likewise, from the next preceding clause to the clause in question, which declares, that any person in possession of negroes, &amp;c., which have been sold by way of mortgage, with right of red-mptum, under the proviso of such sale, <em>whereby the same negroes became forfeited, and, so, of right, belonged to the. mor gagee, </em>the mortgagor, having neglected the payment of the. money, or other legal t itisfaction, for the red mption thereof, according to the proviso, shall be.debarred, and forever foreclosed from any <em>right </em>or <em>equity of rel emotion.</em></summary>\n<summary data-order=\"9\" data-type=\"summary\" id=\"Aa-N\"><page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"288\">*288</page-number>There Were other grounds stated for a new, trial; but, as they a|j proceet\u00a1et-j the huppORed impropriety of the finding of the jiir3' UP;&gt;1' questions of fact,; and as the facts appeared to have been fairly before the jury, and the questions arising thereon, properly Rft to their determination, this court was of opinion, that those - grounds were not supported, and that the veidiet could not be' avoid-a/* upon .riiy of them.</summary>\n<summary data-order=\"10\" data-type=\"summary\" id=\"b296-5\">Upon that ground, which related to the limitation act, the court c\u00ed!
