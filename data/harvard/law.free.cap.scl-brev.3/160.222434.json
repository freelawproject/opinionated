The motion for a new trial, which rested principally on this point, was discharged.</summary>\n<summary data-order=\"11\" data-type=\"summary\" id=\"b168-11\">The motion in arrest of judgment was grounded on two objections to the indictment. 1. That the indictment does not specify the name of the owner, or manager of the slave, from whom <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"161\">*161</page-number>ihe com is stated to have been bought. 2. That it is not stated that the slave had not a ticket or permit so to deal, &amp;c., from and uuder the hand of his master or ownef, or such other person as had the care or management of such slave ; but only that he had , \u201e , ,. \u2022 , \u25a0 no ticket from his master or owner.</summary>\n<attorneys data-order=\"12\" data-type=\"attorneys\" id=\"b169-6\">Mr. Cheves argued for the defendant,</attorneys>\n<summary data-order=\"13\" data-type=\"legal\" id=\"A8W\">that this was a penal law, <em>creating an offence, </em>and ought to be strictly construed. To buy from a slave was lawful before the passing of this act, whether he had a ticket or not.\u2019 The act declares, that <em>so to deal </em>with a slave, as is particularly expressed, and prohibited, in the act, shall subject the party to a penalty, unless the slave shall have a ticket, or permit, from under the hand of his master or owner, <em>or suck other person as may have ike care or management of suck slave. </em>In order to have charged the offence with proper certainty, it was n\u00e9cessafy that the indictment should state, not only that the slave had not any ticket, or permit, from his master or owner, but also that ho had not any ticket, or permit, from such other person as had the caic or management of him,'according to the expressions of the act; for otherwise he might be convicted of the offence as charged in the indictment, \u00e1nd innocent of the offence created by the act, as he might not have a ticket from his master of owner, and yet have one from the overseer, of other person having the management of him.</summary>\n<summary data-order=\"14\" data-type=\"legal\" id=\"b169-7\">But it is also necessary that the name of the master, owner/ &amp;c., should be set forth. The law requires certainty: and in criminal proceedings there ought to be great strictness, and par-\" ticular certainty. King v. Mason. 2 T. R. 581. 1 Str. 497. Cowp. 082. 2 Hawk. P. C. 329. It ought to appear of re-\u2019 cord with what and whose slave the party convicted has dealt\u00bb-' The slave\u2019s name ought also to be mentioned.</summary>\n<attorneys data-order=\"15\" data-type=\"attorneys\" id=\"b169-12\">The attorney general, Pringle, <em>contra.</em></attorneys>\n<summary data-order=\"16\" data-type=\"legal\" id=\"Aux\">The strictness -of ancient times has been relaxed very much of late years. A more liberal and rational spirit of construction has been adopted. Little' attention is now paid to many exploded niceties, which were for. jnerly much regarded, and served only to puzzle and perplex the administration of justice. If an offence be charged with sufficient. certainty, so as to comprehend the substantial matter or cause of prosecution, it is enough : <em>there </em>is no need to state every particular in detail, and at length. 2 Hawk. P. C. 329. In an indictment on stat. 30 Geo. 2, c. 24, for obtaining money by false pretences, the person, with whom a wager is laid to have\u2019been made, need not he named. 3 T, R. 100. So an indictment on 37 Gecn <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"162\">*162</page-number>3, c. 70, for seducing soldiers, need not set out the <em>means </em>used ibt? that purpose. Fuller\u2019s ease, 2 Leach, 790;</summary>\n<summary data-order=\"17\" data-type=\"legal\" id=\"b170-7\">Where the person murdered is unknown* the indictment is good,if it be so laid. So here the slave may be unknown, and so may his master. Indictment lies for harboring <em>numerous thieves, </em>without-naming them. The words of the act- must be construed <em>reddendo singula </em>singulis. If the slave has a master, or owner, it must be stated he had a permit from such master, or owner. If he has no master, or owner, under whose care or management he immediately is, then must the indictment state that he had no permit from <em>such other person, \u00bfpc. </em>Nothing need be inserted in an indictment that is not necessary to be proved. In this case it was not necessary to prove that the negro had- not a ticket from such <em>other </em>person, <em>dpc., </em>because he was under the immediate care and directiou of his owner.</summary>\n<opinion data-order=\"18\" data-type=\"opinion\" id=\"x999-1\" type=\"majority\">\n<author id=\"b170-8\">\n<em>Per tot. cur.</em>\n</author>\n<p id=\"Apub\">The judgment must be arrested.- The offence is-not charged with sufficient certainty. The words, \u201c or such other person,\u201d &amp;c., ought not have been omitted. For any thing that appears on the face of the indictment, the party might be innocent of any offence against the act, and yet be guilty of the offencecharged in the indictment.</p>\n<p id=\"b170-9\">Judgment arrested.-</p>\n</opinion>\n</casebody>\n",
