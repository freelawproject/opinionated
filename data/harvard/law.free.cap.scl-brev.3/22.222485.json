For that the law had entrusted to the county co\u00fcrts the taking of such bonds, in behalf of the public, and would never presume that they were not properly taken; and even if taken in the way this, bond appears to have been taken, yet the courts ought to support them. The county -courts may be considered as the agents of the defendants, as well as of the treasurers,or the public.; and as agents of the defendants they wrote and executed the:bond, pursuant to the intention of both parties. That good faith, and the public interest, required that such a construction should be made of the transaction as might confirm the bond, and compel the defendants to answer according to the intention, of the parlies, as evidenced' by the nature of the transaction, if consistent with the rules and principles of law. Upon this principle the bond ought to be con<page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"24\">*24</page-number>side\u00ed\u00e9d as the concurrent act of the parties, executed by tlioir mu. tual agent, conformably to their express directions;</p>\n<attorneys id=\"Azp\">Mathis, for plaintiffs.
