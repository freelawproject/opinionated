It appeared in evidence, that the over? seer of the negro, with whom the defendant traded, had secretly permitted the negro to carry corn to the defendant, to deal with him, in order to .ascertain whether the defendant would trade with the negro for it, when it did not appear to him, the defendant, that the negro had any permission so to do. It was proved that the defendant did receive from the negro ,a basket full of corn, for which he promised payment; the overseer being present, but unseen by the defendant.</summary>\n<summary data-order=\"6\" data-type=\"summary\" id=\"b559-8\">Wilds, J., charged the jury to acquit the defendant, because, although in a moral point of view, the defendant was as guilty of the offence charged against him, as if the com had been received by him contrary to the knowledge and will of the owner, or of the person having the care or management of the slave, yet, in a legal view, he could not be found guilty, since the trafficking with the negvo was not contrary to the permission, and without the knowledge of, the owner or manager of the negro ; and because it appeared to be rather a dealing with the overseer than with the slave. See A. A. 1796,-which forbids every person, directly, or indirectly, to deal, trade, or traffic, with any slave, not having a ticket, or permit, under the hand of his master, or such person as may have the care or management of such slave.</summary>\n<summary data-order=\"7\" data-type=\"summary\" id=\"b559-9\">The .jury found contrary to the judge\u2019s charge.
