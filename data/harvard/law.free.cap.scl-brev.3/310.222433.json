Action for words, tried before Trezevant, J. in Fairfield district. The plaintiff had obtained an order for judgment, which defendant moved to set aside, and to have leave to \u201cplead not guilty,\u201d and a justification. The judge, however, refused to permit the defendant to plead the last plea, on the ground that it was not an <em>issuable plea, </em>within the meaning of the rule of court.

Defendant ought not to be allowed to reap an advantage from his delay in pleading, which he would be enabled to do by suffering an order for judgment to go, and then at the court, when the plaintiff has had no notice of his defence, set up a special justification, or other unexpected defence, which will have the effect of a dilatory pk a.

Barnes, 271. It must not be a <em>dilatory </em>plea, but one which will mei t the merits of the cause, and advance justice. The plea of justification in slander, is an issuable plea, and within the meaning of the rule. The plaintiff ought to be prepared to rebut such evidence, in case the defendant should move to plead, so as to be entitled to offer it. If he is not prepared, he will be entitled to a continuance. The inconvenience to which, he would, by this means, be exposed,, would not be so great as the defendant would be exposed to suffer, in ease' he could not be allowed, after an order for judgment, the benefit of a plea of justification.
