But in case he, or the lawfully begotten heir, should die without a lawfully begotten heir, then, and in that case, I give the plantation containing twelve hundred and' forty acres, more <em>ov </em>less, where my son, Jonah, lives, to my grandson, Robert Huggins, to him, and the lawfully begotten heirs of his body forever.\u201d That the testator died after making the said will, and his son, the said John Jonah Murrell, entered into the said devised plantation of land, by virtue of the said devise. That the said John Jonah Murrell was lawfully married, and had issue born : and that during the tifo time of such issue, to wit, on the 9th of August, 1794, the said John Jonah Murrell did absolutely sell and convey the aforesaid plantation, in fee simple, to the defendant Mathews ; in part payment whereof, the bond on which this action is brought, was founded. If, therefore, under these circumstances, the said John -Jonah Murrell, the plaintiff, had an absolute right, vested in him by the aforesaid devise, to the said plantation ; and his conveyance thereof be valid, and sufficient to transfer an estate, in fee simple, absolute to the defendants ; then we find for the plaintiff. Otherwise, if his conveyance was not sufficient, then for the defendant.\u201d</summary>\n<opinion data-order=\"6\" data-type=\"opinion\" id=\"x999-1\" type=\"majority\">\n<author id=\"b198-6\">The court</author>\n<p id=\"AP3\">were of opinion, that the plaintiff, by force of the devise in question took an estate, in fee simple conditional at common law ; and that by having issue the condition was performed, so as to enable him to aliene : and that having aliened after such <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"191\">*191</page-number>performance, and in the life time of the issue, the estate so aliened became absolute in the purchaser. 2 Bl.
