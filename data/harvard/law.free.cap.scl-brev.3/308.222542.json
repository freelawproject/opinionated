The action was debt, and was tried before Brevard, J. in Lancaster district. The specialty declared on, was in the form a promissory note, only concluding with the words \u201c witness my hand and seal;\u201d and having a scroll instead of a seal: and there was not any name of a witness subscribed. It was objected, at the trial, that the <em>delivery </em>ought to be proved, as well as the signature of the obligor: but the judge suffered it to go to the jury, upon proof of the signature of the obligor. The handwriting of the person who drew the instrument, was also proved, who was dead; and part of the obligor\u2019s name was <em>written </em><page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"309\">*309</page-number>$n the seal, or place of the seal.

That the <em>delivery </em>of deeds, is essential to their existence, and to the proof of debts; and ought to be proved by one witness at least. Loffts.

The deed being in the possession ,of the obligee, is proof presumptive of a delivery to him. Esp. 257. Peake\u2019s N. P. 258. 4 T. R. 313 JNIo particular mode of delivery necessary.

The signature of the obligor, after the words, \u201c witness my hand seal.\u201d must be considered as strong presumptive evidence that the seal was put to the instrument, at the time of the signature. It is also presumptive evidence of a delivery; which is corroborated by the circumstance of the specialty\u2019s being in the possession of the obligee. The argument founded on the danger to be apprehended from adding seals to motes, to give the effect of specialities, cannot apply to this case; because, the words, \u201c witness my hand and seal,\u201d shew that a seal was intended to be added. And, moreover, the obligor appears to have written part of his name on the scroll, annexed in the place of a seal, after the scroll was made.</p>\n<p id=\"b317-13\">potion for 3 new trial discharged,</p>\n</opinion>\n</casebody>\n",
