It Was opposed, in behalf of one Luyten, a principal creditor of the defendant, on several grounds, but principally because the county court judges, exercising the powers of commissioners of special bail, had no authority to discharge the defendant under the insolvent debtor\u2019s act of 1759, as the defendant\u2019s <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"26\">*26</page-number>counse^ contended they had, and besought them to do; and ths county court judges, having doubts on the question, refused to make any final determination thereon, but referred the same for the dec\u2018s'on superior court. Whereupon the defendant\u2019s counsel moved for his discharge under the insolvent debtor\u2019s act of <em>1759) </em>in the district court of Camden ; and they contended, that the county court judges, as commissioners of special bail, which by act of assembly they are constituted <em>ex officio,</em><footnotemark><em>*</em></footnotemark><em> </em>were competent to put in force the said act of 1759, and discharge the defendant from all claims against him, in the manner prescribed by that act. They admitted that the acts of 1759, and of 1788, respecting prison bounds, &amp;c., did seem to point out different modes of relief not entirely reconcileable with each other : but they insisted that the intention of the act of 1788, was <em>to amend the act of </em>1759, so as to extend the relief, and alter, in some respects, the manner of proceeding to obtain the same, and that both acts ought to be taken and construed together, as one entire and connected sj'stem, for the relief of insolvent debtors ; and that in order to render them con\u00bb sistent, and make them agree, every repugnant provision of the <em>former </em>act must be considered as repealed by the latter. They en\u00bb deavored to give such interpretations to the several clashing clauses of those two acts, as suited their purpose,\u2019 and to evince that the commissioners of special bail might give the relief afforded by the act of 1759, in the way that it had been applied <em>for; and they contended </em>that the present application being by way of appeal from their decision, this court would do what they ought to have done, or take it up as a motion, <em>de novo, </em>and give the relief applied for.</summary>\n<summary data-order=\"8\" data-type=\"summary\" id=\"A21\">On the other side, against the motion, it was laid down, that the insolvent debtor\u2019s act of 1759, and the act respecting prison bounds, passed in 1788, establish two different and independent modes of relief; distinguishable not only as to the forra and man. ner of proceeding to be pursued for obtaining the benefit, of the relief afforded by each, but also as to the extent of the relief, and the effect and consequences resulting therefrom. The act of 1759, it was argued, relates only to \u201c poor, distressed and insol\u00bb vent prisoners for debt,\u201d as appears by the preamble thereof; and, therefore, before the year 1788, many persons confined on civil process, who did not answer the description of <em>debtors, </em>could not receive any relief under that act. To <em>remedy </em>this grievance,, <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"27\">*27</page-number>the legislature thought proper, by a distinct and separate clause of the prison bounds act of 1788, (the 6th clause,) to extend the benefit of the relief afforded by the act of 1759, to \u201call prisoners in execution, or on mesne process, in any civil action,\u201d except as is therein excepted. But this is the only part of the act of 1788, which has any reference to, or dependence on, the act of 1759. The other clauses of the act of 1788, prescribe another and a different system, for the relief of prisoners confined on .civil process. The counsel then proceeded to contrast the modes prescribed by these several acts, for proceeding, in order to obtain the relief given by them, respectively, and the nature and extent of the, relief afforded by them, respectively. By the former act the application must be by petition to the court from whence the process issues; and after delivering in a schedule, there must be an order of court for the prisoner and all his creditors to appear before the court, at the next court thereafter, &amp;c.; and after hearing and examining the matter, the court is authorized to administer a certain oath, and set the prisoner at liberty. By the latter act, the prisoner is- entitled to the relief thereby provided, upon rendering a schedule of his property, on oath, to the clerk of the court out of which the process issues, by virtue of which, he is kept in custody ; and the clerk, within ten days, must give public notice, that the prisoner will be liberated, and his property assigned, unless cause be shewn to the contrary, before one or more of the judges of the circuit courts, or one or more commissioners of special bail. No time is prescribed for notice by the latter act. The former act requires three months notice in the gazette. The former act requires the assignment to be made to the creditor, at whose suit the prisoner stands charged, or to such other person as the court shall direct; and such assignment to be in trust for all the creditors who may be willing to accept dividends. The latter act directs the assignment to be made to the plaintiff, at whose suit the prisoner is confined, subject to all prior incumbrances. By the former act the prisoner is to be discharged from the claims and demands of all his creditors, if <em>such creditors </em>shall agree to accept dividends of his estate, under the assignment; which discharge shall be an absolute release of all such demands, so that any property which the prisoner may afterwards acquire, shall not be liable thereto : and if any of the creditors shall not agree to accept <em>dividend's, </em>as aforesaid, although their debts and demands shall not be discharged, in like manner, as if they had accepted, but shall remain to charge the future estate of the debtor; yet shall their claims be postponed, and <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"28\">*28</page-number>suspended for twelve months, during which time they shall not be permitted to pursue any legal means for recovering their demands, and in the meantime shall not be allowed any benefit of the estate assigned, which shall be exclusively divided among the creditors willing to accept their proportionable parts thereof, as under a commission of bankruptcy, they thereby agreeing to the entire release- \u25a0 ment and discharge of the debtor, from their respective demands, and that the same shall not enure to charge any estate he may afterwards acquire. But the act of 1788, contains no such provisions. The effect of an assignment and discharge under that act, is to release the prisoner from confinement, under the process, by virtue of which he shall be in custody, and transfer, by way of bargain and sale, the effects, &amp;c., contained in the schedule, to the creditor or plaintiff, at whose suit the defendant is confined, in satisfaction of the demand for which he is so confined ; and after such assignment, the assignee may sue in his own name, to. recover the effects, &amp;c., assigned. But the other creditors of the prisoner shall not be at all affected by such proceedings 5 nor shall such assignment extinguish the claim of the plaintiff, to whom the assignment shall be made, oxcept as to so much as shall be satisfied by the property assigned, but the future property and effects of such prisoner, shall be liable to all his former debts, and all prior demands, as if no advantage had been taken of this act; and no postponement or suspension of the common modes of recovery, is effected by this act. By the act of 1759, the creditors, after notice, shall attend at the time and. place appointed, for hearing the prisoner\u2019s application for relief; and mortgagees and trustees of the prisoner, or their representatives, must also attend, and deliver to the court a fair account, on oath, of what is really due to them, respectively, &amp;e. The act of 1788, contains no provision of this sort; and it cannot be reasonably contended, that the provisions of the act of 1759, in this respect, apply to, or consist with, the scope and design of the act of 1788.</summary>\n<summary data-order=\"9\" data-type=\"summary\" id=\"b36-3\">Upon the whole, it was insisted, that these two acts afforded relief in two different causes, and that it was necessary to consider them as relating to different objects, and not as relating to the very same object, and as furnishing one entire and uniform system of relief in all cases embraced within their respective provisions. That it is a rule of construction, applicable as \\vell to statutes as to deeds, <em>ut res magis valeat tpiam pereat. </em>Such interpretation ought to be made of them as to preserve every part of them in force, and give effect to their several provisions, rather' than such a construction as <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"29\">*29</page-number>must necessarily destroy or make void any part, for the purpose of forcing into agreement and consistency the other parts. And that statutes made in <em>pari materia, </em>ought to be liberally and beneficially expounded, to advance the objects in view, and give consistent effeet to every part of them, so as to reconcile every seeming contradiction, if possible, and give force to the whole ; and not so as to do away, as null and void, every repugnant particle in one statute, for the purpose of giving effect to an arbitrary construction of another, which construction must necessarily set one at variance with the \u2022other. The counsel then proceeded to shew, that the prisoner had not proceeded properly to take the benefit of the relief provided by \u25a0either of the acts of assembly in question. That he had gone upon mistaken ground, and had no claim to present relief under either act; \u25a0for that the relief afforded in either case, being given by act of assembly, by which the \u2022 specific mode is expressly pointed out, the prescribed mode ought to be strictly pursued, otherwise the party cannot bring himself within the benefit of the relief provided.</summary>\n<attorneys data-order=\"10\" data-type=\"attorneys\" id=\"A55\">Brown and Mathis, for the prisoner.
