Item : I give and bequeath all and singular the'rest, residue, and remainder, of my personal estate, of what nature or kind soever, unto my lovtng wife, Sarah, and daughter, Jean, to be equally divided between them, share and share alike, by two indifferent men, to be chosen by my executors for that purpose, to them, my said wife, Sarah, and daughter, Jean, their, and each of their heirs, forever. And in case of the death of either of them, then my w ill and desire is, that the survivor shall enjoy the whole, to <em>them and their </em>heirs forever.

The words \u201c share and share alike,\u201d and t!to be equally divide ',\u201d it was agreed, clearly create a tenancy in common; but the question was, what construction and eifi-Ct should' be given to the subsequent words of survivorship, upon the death of the wife and daughter of the testator. For the plaintiff it was insisted, that it was clearly the intent of the testator \u201c that the stfrvi. vor should enjoy the whole and that although during their joint lives, the legatees might be considered as tenants in common, yet upon the death of eitliyr, the survivor was intitled to the Whole, 2-P. Wms. 280, but for life only. That although in England j'oiuti. tenancies are not favored, because they create inconvenient estates,- and do not so wmll provide for families ; yet here, with us, the case' is different, for the ground of objection does not exist.- That the <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"417\">*417</page-number>act of 1791, abolishing the right of primogeniture, takes away the <em>jus accrescendi, </em>or light of survivorship, and on the death of a joint-tenant, the estate is turned into a tenancy in common. But in this case, it was contended, that the words \u201c and in case of the death o\u00ed either o\u00ed them, the survivor shall enjoy the whole,\u201d must be construed to mean, if either should die without issue: because,- it was insisted, the testator never could have intended so unnatural a thing, as that in case o\u00ed the death of his daughter leaving lawful issue, the widow should take the whole! or that the estate should go over to his collateral kindred. And it would be doing less violence to the will, and favoring the intent more, to add the words, \u201c without issue,\u201d than to reject the words of survivorship, or to supply the words \u201cin my lifetime.:\u201d for it was sain that these last words must be superadded, if the words of the will \u201cin case of the death, &amp;c.\u201d are to be construed as relating to the testator\u2019s death. Upon the death of both legatees, without issue, the plaintiff became infilled; and ail the cases which pin the dying down to the testator\u2019s death, go upon the reason of its favoring the intent, and providing for children.</summary>\n<summary data-order=\"12\" data-type=\"legal\" id=\"b425-3\">On the other side it was argued, that the authorities were all clearly in favor of the construction which fixes the era of dying to the death of the testator, or confines the event to the testator\u2019s life time. Wills are always expounded favorably for children, and grand children, because it is always presumed to be agreeable to the testator\u2019s intention to provide for them, unless the contrary plainly appears : but in a case like the present, no injustice, or hardship, of the grandchildren of the testator being left unprovided tor, will be likely to result from the construction contended for by the defendant, whereas a different construction would be productive of great evil. There is no danger that it will operate to the disinhe* ritance of the testator\u2019issue, if the event, or contingency,-on which the estate is to pass over, be confined to the life time of the testator ; for upon the happening of the event in his life time, if the legatee should die leaving issue, the testator has it in his power by making another will, or by adding a codicil, ro provide for such issue. It appears evident from tne whole will that the testator intended a tenancy in common,-and not a joint.tenancy, not only by the expressions \u201cshare and share-'alike,\u201d and \u201cto be equally divided,\u201d but from the power giren to the executors to appoint proper persons to make partition; wtwelris-a person: 1 trust, or duty, to beexeeuted by them, and therefore not to be deferred in expectation of some future event, which might, or might not, happen during their <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"418\">*418</page-number>lives. The words denoting a joint tenancy cannot be construed te create a joint-tenancy, in direct opposition to the testator\u2019s manifest intent to the contrary, which directs a division; for joint-tenant\u00bb by the common law are not compellable to m.tke partition, Co. Litt. 187 : nor were tenants in common. The meaning, therefore, of the words \"that the survivor shall enjoy tue whole,\u201d must be, that in Case of the death of either the wife, or daughter, hi the testator\u2019s life time, the survivor should have the whole. The Words \u201c without issue\u201d cannot be supplied to favor a surmised, or conjectural intent, although they might <em>be </em>to further a clear and manifest intent And the intent not being obviously clear, the general rule of construetion must be adhered to, viz. \u201c that where a tenancy in common is clearly created, and afterwards in the same will the testator declares* that in case of the death of either <em>of the tenants w common, </em>the estate shall go to the survivor, or survivors, these latter words shall be construed to prevent a lapse, by the death <em>of </em>any of the co-ienants in the life time of the testator, -ami not to alter the estate to a joint.tenancy. Then, if \u00a1his construction is allowed to prevail, it must he understood that the limitation over to the (estator\u2019\u00bb brothers, by viriue of which the plaintiff claims, could not take efffect, unless both the wife and daughier of the testator had died before him : tor the exposition oi (he words \u201cin case of the death of either,\u201d and \u201cin ease of the death of both,\u201d ought to be uniform and consistentand therefore the death of either, or of both,must be ct 'nfiued to the same <em>era, </em>or point of time. The wife and daughter took, as tenanis in common, the negroes in question ; and upon the division which was made between them, the same negroes became the separate and absolute property of the daughter, and the plaintiff has no right to recover.</summary>\n<opinion data-order=\"13\" data-type=\"opinion\" id=\"x999-1\" type=\"majority\">\n<author id=\"b426-7\">The court</author>\n<p id=\"A9t\">took lime to consider of their opinion, until May, 1805, when Brevard was the only judge present who had heard the arguments in the case ; but the parties agreeing that the opinion of Trezevant, J. Who was absent sick, and had sent his opinion-in writing, should he read, the same was read.</p>\n<author id=\"AcU\">Brevard, 3.</author>\n<p id=\"AQ4\">delivered his opinion as follows, after slating lha case : It seems to be admitted on both sides, that the words \" in case of the death of either of them.\u201d and \u201cin case of the death of both,\u201d must be construed to relate to some ora, or definite period of time, orto some event, or circumstance, other than the death of the lega, tees, and not to a dying generally ; or that they must be rejected altogether as uncertain and void It was contended on 'behalf of the plaintiff, that the words \u201c without issue\u201d ought to be supplied, to <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"419\">*419</page-number>give effect to the intention of the testator, and a consistent meaning to the words in question ; and that upon she death of the wife and daughter, both without issue, the property vested in the plain. tiff, by virtue of the devi.v- over to the testator's! brothers. The verdict does not state <em>how </em>the plaintiff becomes; infilled under the devise over; but his right to cb .m upon that ground seems to be admitted. It was also contended for the plaintiff, that although the words \u201c to be equally divided,\u201d \u00abfee. make a tenancy in common, yet the subsequent words, -\u2018 he survivor shall enjoy the whole,\u201d shew that ttie testator did not intend a tenancy in common, except during ihe joint lives of the legatees, hut that upon the death of either, the survivor should take the whole : and therefore, upon the death of the wite without issue, the daughter became in titled to the benefit of the whole bequest and to enjoy the same duriug her life, and to be hers absolutely forever, provided she had issue; but she having died without issue, the property bequeathed to her then in\u00bb stantlv vested in the plaintiff.</p>\n<p id=\"b427-4\">On the contrary, it was argued for the defendant, that the words \u201c in case of the death,\u2019\u2019 &amp;e. must be construed to confine such case of death to the life time of the testator, and to fix the era of survivi &gt;g to his death : and therefore, as the legatees both survived the testator, the devise over could not take effect.</p>\n<p id=\"b427-5\">The governing rule for the co struciion of wills, is, that the intention of the testator shall prev-iil, if it cae he ascertained, and if it be not incompatible wi-.b the roles of law. But if the intention be unknown, tr certain, or merely <em>c &gt; </em>j.-eutral, then the <em>legal intent </em>shall prevail. It is certai ly ve.v import tut, a -d .very useful, to explain the law on such principles as may afford rules to guide us in the construction of \u00abtiter cases of a similar i ato re. By such means our proceedings require uniformity, certainty, and stability, and security is given to civil rights. In the present case, the intention of the testator is uncertain. It is by no means clear, what was intended by the words, ** in case of the death of either,\u201d or \u201c in case of the death of both ;\u201d or whether the testator meant to give the property in joint-tenancy, or in common. It becomes tieeessary, therefore, to resort to legal reasoning, and to the rules furnished by analogous cases, to enable us to expound these words with legal propriety and effect.</p>\n<p id=\"b427-6\">The expressions \u201cequally to be divided,\u201d and \u201cshare and share alike,\u201d and also the direction in what manner to make a division of the property' bequeathed, all clearly imp wt ateraucy in common. Prec. Ch. 164. 2 Eq. Ca. Abr. 535 1 Salk. 326. 1 P. Wms. 96. 1 Vern. 33. 2 Vern. 323. I Ves. 165.</p>\n<p id=\"AaMG\"><page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"420\">*420</page-number>The subsequent words of the bequest, which give the whole to the survivor, indicate a joint tenancy; but the words which imme\u00bb diately follow,, viz. \u201c to <em>them, </em>and <em>their </em>heirs, forever,\u201d are repugnant and contradictory. In the exposition of last wills, it is a principle that every word shall have its effect, and not be rejected, if any construction can possibly be put upon it.</p>\n<p id=\"b428-4\">In the case of Barker v. Giles, 2 P. Wms. 280, where the do-vise was to two, and the survivors, and survivor of them, and their heirs, and assigns, forever, equally to be divided between them, share and share alike; and the difficulty was to reconcile and give effect to the words of survivorship, and the words importing a tenancy in Common, without rejecting any of them, the Lord Chancellor construed the words to mean a joint-tenancy <em>for life, </em>with several inheritances in common, by which every word had effect.</p>\n<p id=\"b428-5\">If the same construction would apply in the present case, it ought to take place ; but the cases are dissimilar. In the present case it seems clear, that the testator intended a division between his wife and daughter, and not between their heirs ; for the executors are directed to chose fit persons to make partition : and in case of the death of either the wife or daughter, the testator\u2019s desire is, \u201c that the survivor shall enjoy the whole. \u201d</p>\n<p id=\"b428-6\">In the case of Stones v. Heurtly, 1 Ves. 165, the devise was to three, \u201c to be equally divided amongst them, and the survivors of them, and their heirs.\u201d The words \u201cand their heirs,\u201d were held to explain what was intended by the word \u201csurvivor,\u201d namely, an equal division between the heirs of him, or them, that should die first, and the surviving devisees or devisee ; according to the construction which was adopted in the case of Blisset v. Cranfield. 1 Salk. 226. 1 Ld. Raym. 624.</p>\n<p id=\"b428-7\">The words \u201c without issue,\u201d cannot be superadded after the words \u201c in case of the death of either, or both,\u201d for there is no certainty that this was the intent of the testator : and the court are not authorized to <em>supply words in order to satisfy a conjectural intent. </em>There are no authorities in point to justify this construction: and moreover, I think it rather more probable, that the testator did not think of providing by his will fo,r a contingency which might never happen, and which in fact did not happen, or which might have happened in his life time, namely, the death of his daughter leaving issue, than that he should have intended the effect which these superadditional words would produce ; for they must have the effect of providing for the issue of the wife by a subsequent marriage.</p>\n<p id=\"b429-3\"><page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"421\">*421</page-number>The case of Spalding v. Spalding, Cro. Car. 185, is not like the present. There the devise was \u201cto J. <em>and the heirs of his body </em>in tee, after the death of A., and if he should die living, A. then over.\u201d The estate being expressly given to J. and the heirs of his body, after the death of A., the words.\u201c without issue\u201d must be implied, in order to give a consistent meaning to the subsequent words, \u201cand if he should die living, A.\u201d &amp;c.</p>\n<p id=\"b429-4\">In the case of Nowlan v. Nelligan, 1 Bro. C. C. 489, there were no words of survivorship. The devise was \u201c to H. N , and in case of her death, over.\u201d The Lord Chancellor supposed the testator meant the death of H. N., when ever it should happen, according to the literal import of the words. This construction involved no contradiction, or repugnancy, to the testator\u2019s intent.</p>\n<p id=\"b429-5\">The cases most in point to the present, confine the words relative to <em>dying </em>and <em>surviving, </em>to two different <em>eras, </em>or particular periods of time : first, to the time when the legacy becomes payable ; secondly, to the life time, or death of the testator.</p>\n<p id=\"b429-6\">Trotter v. Williams, and Haws v. Haws, are two cases of the first mentioned description. In Trotter v. Williams, Prec. Ch. 28, 8 Vin. Abr. 328. the bequest was of a certain sum to A., and of a certain other sum to B., \u201c and if either of them die, then his legacy to the survivor.\u201d Here the dying was construed to refer to the time when the legacies became payable.</p>\n<p id=\"b429-7\">So in the case of Haws v. Haws. 1 Ves. 14. 3 Atk. 524. There the legacy was of a <em>customary part, </em>by which it,- evidently appeared that <em>the testator did not mean a survivorship of himself: </em>therefore Lord Hardwicke referred the dying to the time, when the legacy was to be paid ; when the legatee sh 'uld attain the age of twenty one years, or mam. <em>go. </em>It was held clearly, that the words of survivorship must be applied to. some particular time, and not to a dying indefinitely.</p>\n<p id=\"b429-9\">In the case of Haws v. Haws, Lord Hardwicke. is made to say, \u201c that dying in the testator\u2019s life is not a iiatur.,1 way of explaining the testator\u2019s intent, as one seldom provides by will for contingencies that are to happen in his life.\u201d There is nevertheless a stream of cases, in the decision of which this rule of construction has been applied: and Lord Hardwicke himself acknowledges, that if no other reasonable construction can be found, the court will resort to this.</p>\n<p id=\"b429-10\">Upon the present occasion, whether the rule be a natural or an artificial one, there seems to be a necessity for having recourse to jt for the purpose of expounding the devise in question ; for there <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"422\">*422</page-number>does not appear to me any other <em>morfe natural or reasonable </em>way of explaining the testator\u2019s intent.</p>\n<p id=\"A0Yf\">In the case of Bindon v. Suffolk, 1 P. Wms. 96, where the de. vise was to five grandchildren, share and share alike, equally to he divided between them, and if any of them died, then his share to go to the survivors and survivor of them, Lord Cowper held and decreed, that the grandchildren were tenants in common, and not joint-tenants ; and that the subsequent words of survivorship have relation to the death of the testator, in order to prevent a lapse of the legacy of any of the grandchildren who might die in the life time of the testator. By this construction every word had effect.</p>\n<p id=\"b430-5\">It seems that this decree was afterwards reversed, on appeal to the Lords, but upon what ground, does not appear. In a subse. quentcase, however, namely, that of Stringer v. Philips, 1 Eq. Ca. Abr. 292, 199, 3 Bac. Abr. 195, the same rule or principle ot construction was adhered to. There the bequest was to five persons, of \u00a3100 each, equally to be divided between them, and the survivors and survivor of them ; and if A'., one ot the five, die before mar. riage, her share to go over. It was held they took as tenants ia common ; and that the words <em>survivors and survivor, being </em>contra, dictory, must either be rejected, or construed to relate to the testa, tor\u2019s death.</p>\n<p id=\"b430-6\">In the case of Rose v. Hill, 3 Bur. 1881, the same words \u201c survivors and survivor,\u201d were made to refer to the death of the testator, to avoid a lapse, and not to constitute a joiut-leuancy.</p>\n<p id=\"b430-7\">In Roebuck v. Dean, 4 Bro. C. C. 403, 2 Ves. Jun. 265, the bequest Was to E. R. during life, and after her decease to .be equally divi. ded between her brother and four sisters, and in like manner to the survivors, or survivor of them It was held, that all those, <em>who survived the testatrix, </em>took as tenants in common.</p>\n<p id=\"b430-8\">In Brograve v. Winder 2 Ves. Jun. 634, the devise W:as of money to be raised by sale, and to be equally distributed .among three sons and a daughter of A. W., or the survivots, or survivor of them; and that such fourth or other part of such money as the daughter should he iutitled to, should be settled upon her prior to any marriage contract, for her life, .and after her death, on her issue, &amp;c\u201e The Lord Chancellor thought the words of survivorship were in. serted to prevent -a lapse ; for otherwise, if any of :the persons had died in the testator\u2019s life, it would have been a lapsed devise for the benefit of the heir. The Lord Chancellor is made to remark in this case, thatP. Wms. report of Bindon v. Suffolk is not accurate; and that the words .related,to the time when the debt should.be paid* which governed the determination of the House of Lords.</p>\n<p id=\"b431-3\"><page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"423\">*423</page-number>In Perry v. Woods, 3 Ves. 204, the bequest was to A. for life, and after her decease to her children ; and if she should leave none, to B. aud C., <em>share, and share alike, </em>or to the <em>survivor. </em>The Master of the Rolls decreed in conformity to- the case of Stringer v. Philips, which he considered a governing case. In this ease, A. died without children : and B. and C. had a vested interest upon the death of the testator, who died living A., as tenants in common. The words <em>share and share alike, </em>create a tenancy in common, unless controlled by circumstances clearly denoting that they are not used m that sense.</p>\n<p id=\"b431-4\">In Maberly v. Strode, 3 Ves. 450, words of survivorship added to a tenancy in common in a will, were applied to the death of the testator, there being no apparent intention to postpone the vesting to (he death of another. The Mastei of the Rolls observed, that the construction that the benefit of survivorship was to prevent a lapse, and to vest an interest at the death of the testator, is much the most beneficial construction.
