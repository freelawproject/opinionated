The mo<page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"234\">*234</page-number>tion in this court was to reverse the decision of the district court. The case was, that plaintiffs had sued on a bond given by defendant\u2019s testator. Defendant pleaded payment since intestate\u2019s death. Plaintiff had a verdict; and defendant, by his false plea, which he knew to be false, had made himself responsible for the debt, <em>do bonis propriis. </em>The judgment, however, bad been entered up by mistake, without specifying in what manner the debt should be let vied : and (he motion therefore was to supply this defect, <em>by adding </em>these words, \u201c to be levied of the goods and chattels <em>of </em>the said J. T. deceased, in the hands of the said J. T. <em>to </em>be adminis., tered, if lie hath so much in his hands to be administered ; and if he hath not, then the said debt, &amp;x. to be levied of the proper goode and chattels of the said J. T.\u201d The Judge refused the motion, thinking that it was not to be considered as the misprision of the clerk, but an error of <em>the </em>court itself in rendering judgment, and not amendable at a subsequent term.</summary>\n<opinion data-order=\"6\" data-type=\"opinion\" id=\"x999-1\" type=\"majority\">\n<p id=\"b242-8\">The Court, however,</p>\n<author id=\"AKQ\">Waties, Bay, Trezevant, and Bhe. yard, Justices,</author>\n<p id=\"ARlA\">after hearing Branding for the motion, and Stark <em>cintra, </em>upon the authority of the cases cited from 5 Bur. 2730, 1 <em>Ld. </em>Raym. 182, 3 T.

Rep. 918; Sayer\u2019s Rep. 12; 3 Wils. 454; 5 Rep. 32; Lill. Prac. Reg. 76, 716, 70; Hob. 90; 8 Rep. 156; 1 Ventr 132; 2 Vin.

The proper judgment, it is said, should be for so much to be levied <em>de bonis testatoris, </em>for that the law will not presume that there are no assets when admitted by the executor, until the return of the sheriff. The costs of the first judgment are to be levied <em>de bonis propriis; </em>because, <em>baring </em>assets, the executor should have paid \u00dci. debt without suit: and the judgment to have execution <em>de bonis propriis </em>for the principal, is always a subsequent judgment, founded on a <em>sei.fa, </em>But a set./a seems to be a useless proceedure, and can answer no end but delay; and the issuing a special <em>fa., </em>upon a return of <em>nulla bona, </em>is sanctioned by Off hxors. 167, and 5 Rep. 32. Therefore, it is presumed the former can never be required. See Hayw. 301.</p>\n</opinion>\n</casebody>\n",
