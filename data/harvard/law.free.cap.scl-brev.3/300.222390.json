Action of <em>assumpsit, </em>tried before Brevard, J. in Sumter district Plaintiff had obtained an order for judgment, and upon the execution of his writ of inquiry, was allowed by the court to give a promissory note, a copy of which was filed with the declaration, in evidence, without any proof of the hand writing of the maker, or of <em>the </em>subscribing witness. This was the ground stated for a new trial; and Matiiis for the defendant, insisted that the practice of oitr courts had always been to require the same proof of notes upon the execution of writs of inquiry, as upon the trial of issues; which practice was well founded, reasonable, and wisely cautious, and therefore ought not to be departed from.</summary>\n<attorneys data-order=\"6\" data-type=\"attorneys\" id=\"b308-10\">Richardson, <em>contra.</em></attorneys>\n<summary data-order=\"7\" data-type=\"legal\" id=\"A-v\">The default of the defendant acknowledges the justice of the plaintiff\u2019s demand ; and the only reason for producing the note in evidence, is to see whether it is the same declared on, and whether any part of it has been paid. In England, it is not necessary to execute a writ of inquiry in such cases ; but the court refers the case to a master, to ascertain the sum due. 4 T. R. 205. 1 Esp. Dig 170. Kyd on Bills, 152. 3 T.

In the case of a bond, the plaintiff is entitled to enter up final judgment, without proof of the bond, unless the defendant will move to set aside the order for judgment at the next court after ills obtained, and plead <em>instanter. </em>The legislature, by a lale act, seems to have been desirous to facilitate the proof of bonds and notes; and the courts will not certainly be <em>astuta </em>to require unnecessary proof of them.</summary>\n<headnotes data-order=\"8\" data-type=\"legal\" id=\"AKdh\">Act of J802, 2 Faust, 453.</headnotes>\n<opinion data-order=\"9\" data-type=\"opinion\" id=\"x999-1\" type=\"majority\">\n<author id=\"b309-4\">By the court.</author>\n<p id=\"A_8_\">The practice has ahvaj's been to require the same proof of notes upon the execution of writs of inquiry, as upon the trial of issues.
