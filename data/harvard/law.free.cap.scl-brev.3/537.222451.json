Plaintiff had sued out a <em>ji. fa. </em>against the defendant, re. turnable fifteen days before the court then next to be holden, viz. in November, 1803. In a short time after, viz. in June, 1803, the sheriff1, at the request of the plaintiff, returned the said writ <em>\u201cnulla bona\u201d </em>Whereupon the plaintiff immediately sued out a <em>ca. </em>sa. against the defendant, by virtue of which he was arrested and con. fined. The defendant being afterwards brought up before the district court, moved to quash the writ of <em>ca, sa., </em>and to be discharged out of the sheriff\u2019s custody ; which Bay, J. ordered accordingly, on the ground that the second writ of execution was illegally issued, being prior to the return day of the first, and the sheriff could not return the <em>fi. fa. </em>until the day on which it was returnable.</summary>\n<summary data-order=\"6\" data-type=\"summary\" id=\"b545-10\">The motion was argued in November, 1804, before Grimice* Waties, Trezevant, and Brevard, Justices, and stood over for further consideration at the request ot Waties, J., who wished to take the opinion of the practitioners in Charleston.

The cases of Sampson v. Hodson, 8 Mod. 302, and Jeanes v. Wilkins, 1 Ves. 195: and the reasoning to be deduced from them, set this case out of doubt, that Bol\u00e1n was legally imprisoned. Sampson v. Hodson, 8 Mod. 302. The plaintiff having obtained judgment in debt against the defendant, sued out a <em>fi. fa. </em>and likewise a <em>ca. sa. </em>at the same time, and thereupon the delend ant was taken in execution. It was moved to quash the <em>fi. fa. </em>The court was of opinion, the plaintiff might for hrs own <em>security </em>take out two writs, but he can execute but one. 1 Ves. 195. During the existence of a <em>ca. sa., </em>and the person in custody, a <em>fi. fa. </em>ought not to be taken out; yet the <em>fi. fa. </em>not void, though it was set aside. So the motion to reverse the decision of the district court, must be supported.</p>\n<p id=\"b546-10\"><em>Note. </em>See 6 Mod. 286. 1 T. R. 228. Barnes, 213, 198.
