Parker, for the assignees of the defendant, obtained a rule on the sheriff, to shew cause why the moneys tendered in satisfaction of certain executions against the defendant, should not be received, and the executions returned satisfied. Bailey shewed for cause, that the money tendered, amounted to the principal sum only, found by the jury, without interest; and, that the plaintiff was intitled to interest on the respective verdicts, from the time they were found.</summary>\n<summary data-order=\"6\" data-type=\"summary\" id=\"b462-11\">Johnson, J., decided, that no interest was chargeable upon the judgments ; and, that the sheriff could only demand the sums for which judgments are entered up, and no more.

By the common law, judgments do not curry interest. In some of the Stat\u2018-s, acts have been passed for the special purpose of declaring that judgments shall carry interest. By the instalment act of 17*s8, P. L. 467, the principal sum of all judgments, and all open accounts, sh til draw interest from the time they become due. But this had relation only to judgments and accounts then existing, and liable to the operation of the instalment act. It was a temporary provision, to guard against the injustice resulting from the interference of the legislature between debtor and creditor, to the hindrance and delay of the latter.
