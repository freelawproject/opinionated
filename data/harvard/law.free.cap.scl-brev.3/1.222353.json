That Pledger\u2019s Neck was not sufficiently certain and particular. That it was not proved the defendants were ready at the uttermost convenient time of the day. That the notice was not reasonable, and therefore not legal notice. That it should have preceded the time &lt;?f payment or delivery, three or four days at <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"2\">*2</page-number>least. That a tender mean's a careful offer at due time and place. r <em>T' </em>Per^orHz a contract, according to the true intent thereof; but '\u25a0his was not <em>so. </em>That the intention of the contract appears from the nature of it. The defendants were to have their election\u00bbeither to deliver the corn at any convenient place on the river\" bank; between Chatham and Greenville, (which places are a considerable distance apart,) or to pay the money such corn was worth. The plaintiff, however, was to have sufficient and timely notice, when and where the corn was to be delivered, that he might' be prepared to receive it. Co.-Litt, 207. a. Salk: 624. Baev Abr.

That the demand being for the pe. naity of a bond, conditioned to perform a specific act, if the plaintiff had proved the act not done agreeably to the condition, he tvould lie-entitled to-the penalty; and therefore, the defendants having proved their compliance with the condition, the action is barred-forever, for the issue\u2019is upon a tender of perishable articles.<footnotemark>*</footnotemark> Bac.

It is founded on a passage i\u00f1 Co. Lift, cited above, and 9 Rep. 79, that defendant shall npt plead <em>uncoreprist, </em>where it is a charge1 for the obligor to keep <em>lona peritura. </em>A debt or duty, may bo discharged by a tender, in cases where it depends entirely on a condition to be performed by a-tender, and is not a debt or duty precedent and independent of the condition.

The demand can carry no interest from the time of the tendon It has been contended that the verdict ought to be for the defendants, because no demand, since the tender, has been proved ;-but I-think the service of process in this action, must be considered as a demand. <em>8ed quaere de hoc.</em><page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"3\">*3</page-number>Verdict for the plaintiff, (payable in corn.<footnotemark>*</footnotemark>)</p>\n<attorneys id=\"AkK\">Johnson and Peace, for plaintiff.

And the defendant may deliver the wheat, if he please; but the sum of money ought, of necessity, to be referred to the day: for if \u00a330 are to be paid, they cannot be paid but as they are at the time, for money is its own measure; otherwise it is. of corn. See 3 Vern. 394. Prec, in Ch. 533. 1 P. Wms. 570. There is a dictum in Carthew, 133, that if a tender be on a bond, with a penalty, the plea ;s in bar of the action; but the reason, if it ever existed, has ceased. A demtmtj after the tender, revives the action. Bee 3 Johns. 30..</p>\n</footnote>\n</opinion>\n</casebody>\n",
