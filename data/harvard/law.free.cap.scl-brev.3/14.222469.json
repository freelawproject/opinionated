But the bail to the sheriff may, at any time before judgment in the original action, enter himself as special bail; and thereby discharge his liability as bail to the sheriff.</headnotes>\n<headnotes data-order=\"5\" data-type=\"headnotes\" id=\"b22-8\">\u2022A bail bond is not void, although taken for a greater sum than is autho-. rizedby the affidavit; but the sheriff, is punishable if lie require excess sive bail,</headnotes>\n<summary data-order=\"6\" data-type=\"summary\" id=\"b22-9\">Scire Facias o.n a bail bond. The sheriff of Camden district had arrested one Cook, by virtue of a writ of <em>capias ad respondendum,, </em>at the suit of the plaintiff, and by virtue of an affidavit, annexed tp the said writ, had held him to .hail; on which occasion the present bond was taken. The scire facias was founded on the 10th section of the county court act of 1785, P. L. 369, which extends to the superior courts, and directs that where bail is given, and the defendant <em>malves default, </em>judgment rnay be had, and execution issued against the defendant; and if the sheriff returns <em>non est inventus, </em>or that the defendant has no effects, the plaintiff may sue forth a scire facias against the hail, and enter up judgment thereon, against such bail, and have execution as against the original defendant: Provided, that the common bail may enter himself special bail at any time before the judgment against his principal is signed.</summary>\n<summary data-order=\"7\" data-type=\"summary\" id=\"b22-10\">To the declaration on this scire facias the defendant demurred. And it was argued in support o\u00ed the demurrer, that the sheriff ought &gt;o have been plaintiff in the action ; that the bail bond ought to have been assigned according to (lie statute, 4 An. c. <em>IS, </em>P. L. 90 ; that the act of 1785, relates to special bail, taken in court, and not to bail to the sheriff; and that the bond was taken for a greater sum than was sworn to, as appears by the affidavit to hold !o bail. Also, that in this case, the defendant <em>ihad not made default, </em>\u00bfo- that it appeared, that he had pleaded after <em>lr, </em>'or ,rte\u201e\\ i a regular appearance; and the judgment against kirn wan \u25a0 . <em>u.t,vull.</em></summary>\n<opinion data-order=\"8\" data-type=\"opinion\" id=\"x999-1\" type=\"majority\">\n<author id=\"b22-11\">By the Court.</author>\n<p id=\"A9q\">O\u00bb W:', ... The act of 1785, has materially</p>\n<p id=\"AZB\">tijt} law \u25a0&gt; v sh/.d, in relation to this subject. As <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"15\">*15</page-number>the law now stands, the bail to'the sheriff becomes responsible for the debt, which may be recovered by scire facias, unless he enter himself special bail some time before the judgment against his principal be signed. The bail bond may still be assigned, and action thereon supported, perhaps ; but it must be better to proceed by scire facias. The defendant has nv-tde default, for <em>the </em>defendant in the original action ought to have put in bail above; or the bail to the sheriff should have surrendered him. As to the bond being taken for a greater sum than the affidavit authorised, it does not avoid fhe bond. The bond, though taken for more, is good; though if for a much greater sum than is usual, the sheriff may be punishable.</p>\n<attorneys id=\"Alf\">Mathis, for plaintiff.

The decision was conformable to the decision of the District Court. The following authorities relate to this point: 6 Mod.268. Lofft\u2019s Rep. 545. 2 Str. 922. Doug. 330. 1 H. Bl. 76. 2 Bl.
