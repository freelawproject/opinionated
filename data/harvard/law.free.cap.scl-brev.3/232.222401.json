Verdie.'s for plaintiffs.^Motion fora new trial o'n several grounds. One exception was to the insufficiency of the evidence which went to establish the identity of the plaintiff\u2019s ward, so as to give him the benefit of the evidence of a recovery of freedom in Virginia. Defendant\u2019s brother was produced, who proved that in conversations in defendant\u2019s family it was spoken of as a fact certain, and well known.This evidence it was objected, ought not to have gone to the jury, being hearsay o-nly. <em>Sed non allocatur. </em>Another exception was to the exemplified copy of the record from Virginia, which was certified by the clerk of the general court at Richmond, by which it appeared, that actions were brought for these wards in the court at Petersburg. A trial at the bar in the general court at Richmond having been ordered, a <em>certiorari </em>was issued from that court to the court at Petersburg, whereupon the proceedings were certified. The plaintiffs then, (the wards of the plaintiff here) recovered their freedom. The whole proceedings were certified by the clerk of the general court, whereas it was contended,that the proceedings of the court at Petersburg should have been exemplied by the clerk of that court. Other exceptions were taken to the record on account of its suspicious appearance, being on two sheets of paper, different in quality and size ; but the hand writing was the same, and the whole record was congruous, and sufficiently full. The clerk \"however, states, in his certificate, that the <em>depositions </em>and other papers in the cause, which would form no part, of the record in case of appeal in Vijgiuia, is not set forth. In reference to this, it was urged that- the whole record was not exemplified; and 7 T. R. 523-, was cited, where it is said, that although-sentences of foreign tribunals are presumed to be just, yet if from reasons stated a&gt; <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"233\">*233</page-number>die grounds of the decision they appear to be unjust, pr the premises given do not warrant the conclusion drawn, they may be examined, and disregarded. So here, as it appears from what is certified, that something remains uncertified,. the court should reject what is sent, and insist upon a view of the whole record, and not receive a part only. The record produced speaks of the plaintiffs as indians ; and the wards of. plaintiffs here are negroes. A variance on the record cannot be reconciled by parol evidence. Sintzenick v. Lucas. , I Esp, Rep. 43.</summary>\n<summary data-order=\"7\" data-type=\"summary\" id=\"b241-4\">On the part of the plaintiffs, it was said, that the court at Peters,, burg is' a court like to a court of <em>nisiprius ; </em>and that judgments are always entered up in the general court, where the record is returned. That the record is conclusive evidence under the federal constitution and act of Congress, and cannot be overhauled here, and its merits enquired into, ^ That the exemplification is not a copy of a copy, but an authentic copy from the original, certified by the keeper of such original record, and( ought not to be questioned. The whole record appears to be certified. The depositions read in. the cause are no part of the record. \u25a0 .. ..</summary>\n<attorneys data-order=\"8\" data-type=\"attorneys\" id=\"AJ9H\">.Falconer for the motion.
