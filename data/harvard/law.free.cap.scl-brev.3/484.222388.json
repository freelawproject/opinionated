The defendants set out the condilion, and pleaded performance. Plaintiff replied, and stated a breach in not returning a true inventory. The case, as it turned out in evidence, was this: The mother of Dorothy, the defendant Geiger\u2019s wife, while <em>sole, </em>made and executed a deed of gift of certain negroes, to her four children, jointly. After-wards, Dorothy intermarried with Jacob Geiger, the intestate, hex <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"485\">*485</page-number>\u25a0former husband. Upon this event, one of the negroes, given as aforesaid, was sent with her, upon her going to live apart from her mother, and remained with her ever since. No regular partition, however, was ever made of the property between the donees. After the death of Jacob Geiger, who died intestate, the defendants administered on his estate, and in the inventory of his estate returned to the ordinary, made no mention of the negroes given as aforesaid.</summary>\n<attorneys data-order=\"6\" data-type=\"attorneys\" id=\"b493-4\">Winns, J. charged the jury,</attorneys>\n<summary data-order=\"7\" data-type=\"legal\" id=\"ABe\">that this omission was a.breach of the condition of the administrador! bond, and the jury found for the plaintiff. The motion in this court was for a new trial, for a misdirection of the judge on that point.</summary>\n<attorneys data-order=\"8\" data-type=\"attorneys\" id=\"b493-5\">Egan, for the defendants,</attorneys>\n<summary data-order=\"9\" data-type=\"legal\" id=\"A2_\">argued, <em>tolls viribus, </em>that the aped of gift conveyed no right of possession to the donees, but only a chose in action, and that no properly vested absolutely by virtue thereof, in Dorothy, while she was covert of her first husband, and consequently, that none could vest in her said first husband ; and therefore, that his representatives were not intitled to take any notice in the inventory of his estate, of the said negroes ; and that the interest of Dorothy therein, was only <em>a chose in action, </em>which survived to her.

It requires some slight <em>evidence of a delivery, </em>in the case of a parol gift, see 2 Str 955, but not where there is written evidence of the gift, for there a delivery must be presumed. Where a merchant beyond sea consigns goods to a merchant in London, on account of the latter, and. draws bills on him for such goods, although the money is not paid, yet the property of the goods <em>vests </em>in the merchant in London, who is credited for them, and they become liable to his debts. 2 Wooddes. 430. 3 P.

If chattels are given to a with, <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"486\">*486</page-number>the interest vests in the husband, although he has not possession of them before the death of the wife. 2 Com.

But <em>qucere, </em>did the undivided part of Dorothy vest 'n possession of her husband by the marriage ? .f the possession was vested in her, it is to be considered as vesting in her husband by the marriage. In the ease of Speight v. Meigs, see below, the distributory share of tho wife was considered as vesting only ill interest and not in possession. This circumstance distinguishes that case from this. If it vested in possession m Dorothy, it vested ill possession, constructively, in the husband, Co. Lit. 351. 2 Bl Com. 397. 2 Com. Dig 84. 2 Hayw. 184, 185. 1 H. Bl. 535.
