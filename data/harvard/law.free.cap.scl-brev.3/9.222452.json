Afterwards, the com which was intended for Colonel Kershaw, in satisfaction for this rent, being swept away by an inundation of the river, before any delivery thereof, the defendant refused to pay the rent in arrear whereupon tins action was brought.</summary>\n<summary data-order=\"7\" data-type=\"summary\" id=\"Aq\"><page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"10\">*10</page-number>This case being disclosed in evidence upon the issue of <em>non </em>ss<em>sumpsit, </em>the counsel in\u2019behalf of the defendant, moved for a non-' suit, insisting that the contract proved was a collateral undertaking to pay the debt of another, and not being in writing, was insufficient by the statute of frauds, 29 Car. 2. c. 3. P. L. 82, to maintain this action. And,' at any rate, as it was expressly agreed, that the pay-merit should be made out of a particular fund'; viz. certain corn, then lying on the river bank, and as that fund had failed, by- the' act of God, an accident against which a careful man,'in the-com-' mon course of things, could not, in general,'guard, the defendant was not chargeable in this case.</summary>\n<summary data-order=\"8\" data-type=\"summary\" id=\"b18-3\">For the plaintiff, was cited the case of William's v. Leper, S\u2019 Burr. 1886, aS in point;- upon the-authority of which case: it was contended, that the agreement was positive and direct, and not\u2019 collateral. That here, there was a new consideration, moving from1 the defendant to the plaintiff\u2019s testator! That\u2019 the latter had been induced by the former, to release a sure and speedy remedy for the recovery of his rent, and to rely Upon his Verbal undertaking to pay the same. That as soon as this agreement was made,'the distress was dissolved ; the old debt was discharged, or at least, the right of recovery which before existed, was extinguished ; and a new-debt was created, \u00e1nd \u00e1 n\u00e9w security was'.substituted. The* undertaking of the defendant was original \u00e1nd direct, that he,hims\u00e9lf, would positively pay, absolutely, and not conditionally, in' consideratibn of the release of the negro, and the discharge of the dis-trfess ; and, therefore, if was denied, that this case came within the scope, reason, or policy, of the statute of- frauds : for it was argued, that the plaintiff\u2019s testator had a <em>lien </em>on the negro dis-trained, which lien he consented to discharge, in consideration of the defendant\u2019s undertaking ; and the defendant\u2019s refusing now to comply with his agreement,- is a' manifest fraud, which the statute ought not to protect. It was further insisted for the plaintiffs, that-the promise in this case, was not to- pay out of a particular or- specific fund, but to pay absolutely and generally ; and that Colonel Kershaw had agreed to take corn on the river- bank, to accommodate the defendant, which was a mere circumstance of accommodation, relative to the.mode of payment, but was not a condition- of the contract.</summary>\n<opinion data-order=\"9\" data-type=\"opinion\" id=\"x999-1\" type=\"majority\">\n<p id=\"b18-4\">By the court.</p>\n<author id=\"A6I\">Waties, J.</author>\n<p id=\"AJY\">The evidence is very proper to go-to the jury. Wherever a man is induced, by another\u2019s promise, to release a remedy,-or forbear the exercise of a right which he has, the consideration is good- to support the promise, as at} original-<page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"11\">*11</page-number>agreement, and it cannot be deemed a collateral undertaking for another, within the meaning of the statute against frauds and juries. Neither does it appear that the parties intended that pay--meat in corn should be an essential part of the contract. It appears to have been casually mentioned, and agreed .on, for the mere. purpose of accommodation.</p>\n<attorneys id=\"A_\">Mathis and Falconer, for pjaintiffs.
