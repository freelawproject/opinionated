The plaintiff stated in his writ and declaration, that his in. testate had recovered against the defendant a certain debt of \u00a3609, Gs. sterling, and \u00a3G, 12s. costs of suit, &amp;c. The defendant pleaded <em>nul lid record, </em>to which issue was joined. The original record was produced before Grimke, J. Upon inspection of the record, there was found no writ, or copy of the bond declared on. The declaration coniaiued no allegation, that the defendant was bound to pay any sum in certain.

It tnust he presumed, alter judgment, that there was a writ, which has been lost m the custouy of the law. The judgment for \u00a3609, 6s. is authorized by the declaration, which mentions <em>that </em>as the sum sued for, and that the d. leridant acknowledged himself bound in the <em>aforesaid sum. </em>The word <em>of </em>may be rejected as surplusage. The verdict finds the debt, and the one shilling must be intended as given tor damages. But it was unnecessary to apply to a jury. The judgment was regularly entered for default. The interlocutory judgment might have been set aside, but was not; and the plaintiff had a right to enter up final judgment without the intervention of a jury. The date of the rendition of judgment appears to be irregular, for it is slated to have been after the signing of the judgment, which could not be. But this is not fatal, because a .clerical mistake. It appears by ihe record, that such a judgment as is put in issue by (he pleadings in this case was rendered ; and as between these parties it is not material when it was <em>signed.</em></p>\n<p id=\"b401-11\">M nion overruled</p>\n<judges id=\"b401-12\">Present, Grimke, Waties, Johnson, Tbezevant, and Brutar\u00bb, Justices; Bay, J, absent.</judges>\n</opinion>\n</casebody>\n",
