Action on the case for harbouring, to try the title to certain negroes, tried in Georgetown district, betore Johnson, J. The act of limitations was pleaded by the defendant; and it appeared in evidence, that the plaintiff had pur. chased the right of two parceners, or joi it heirs of an intestate, of the negroes in question. That an action of <em>trover </em>had been commenced within four years after the eldest co-heir had attained the age of twenty one ; which was discontinued, and the present action was brought two years afterwards, but not within four years after the other co-heir came of age. The presiding judge charged in favor of the defendant, whereupon there was a verdict for the de\u00ab fendan . Two questions were made.: 1st. Wtieiher the infancy of a joint proprietor, will avail other proprietors, who are adults-2d. Whether the seco.id action in this case, could be considered asa continuance ot ihe first action.</summary>\n<summary data-order=\"7\" data-type=\"summary\" id=\"b337-12\">For the plaintiff, the same arguments were urged as in the case preceding, relative to the first question, and the. same authorities were quoted : and it. was insisted, that die same doctrine would apply in a case concerning personal property, as in a case concern.ng real est te. Lstt. Sect. (166 Where the right is insepa.

Bac. Abr. Tit. Severance. Judgment of severance cannot be given in a personal action. Continual claim by one jointenant shall avail others not of age in respect of the pi ivity of estate. Co. Litt. 252.</summary>\n<summary data-order=\"8\" data-type=\"summary\" id=\"b338-5\">On the other ground it was contended, that the second action might be considered as a continuance of the first, being brought for the same cause of action in the same right, only a little variant in form: and that it would work great evil, if this construction should not prevail; because otherwise a man might bring his action in good time, but by a fatality not unfrequent, might mistake the form of his remedy, and before the mistake could be rectified, he would be barred by the act of limitations. He ought to be allowed to apply to the court for leave to change his remedy, to prosecute the same right in a different form.</summary>\n<summary data-order=\"9\" data-type=\"summary\" id=\"b338-6\">For the defendant it was contended, that the parties of age might have compelled the minors to join in a suit to recover their joint right.

Cited Pothier on Contracts, 2 vol. 148, respecting the distinction between contracts divisible and indivisible. Indivisible as a horse, or slave. Divisible as sheep, &amp;c.

Impey\u2019s Prac. 561, was cited to shew the effect of a discontinuance of process. The second suit was not brought within a reasonable time after the discontinuance of the first. The opportunity of prosecution was lost. And a discontinuance implies a total abandonment of that action, and makes it as if it never had existed. 3 Term. Rep. 362, 632. A continuance must be by further proceedings on the original suit.</summary>\n<opinion data-order=\"11\" data-type=\"opinion\" id=\"x999-1\" type=\"majority\">\n<p id=\"b338-9\">The court were of opinion, that inasmuch as the rights of those persons under whom the plaintiff claimed were conjunct, and incapable of a distinct and several exercise and operation in law, he-<page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"331\">*331</page-number>fore partition, they must have sued jointly ; and although they might sue separately, and recover, yet the part owner so recovering could only recover a joint right, <em>i. e. </em>an undivided moiety of the whole, and could only enjoy the thing recovered as joint owner, and subject to the claims of the other co-proprietors : therefore the right of one of them, being saved by virtue of the exception in ille act ot limitations, saves the rights of the others, as the whole of their rights joined together constitutes bat a single .right, capable of supporting an action ; and their right of action could not be barred, until the right of each' joint owner was barred. On the other point, the judges were all of opinion, that the second action could not be considered a continuance of the first on any ground. The second action was different in form from the first. It was not brought until twelve months after the discontinuance of the first. A discontinuance cannot be .continued. If an irregular action be brought, it will prevent the limitation act from barring. Bac. Abr. Tit. Limitations. But a nonsuit is different from a discontinuance, and the second action must appear to be a revival of the original action.</p>\n<attorneys id=\"AkS\">Pres\u00f3le, Desaussure, and Gaillard, for plaintiff.

The first was not returned; the latter was served on the defendant It was decided, that the first writ ought to have been returned, otherwise the second could not be connected with it.
