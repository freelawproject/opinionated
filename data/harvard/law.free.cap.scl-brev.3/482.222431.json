The defendant was indicted before Wilds, J,, in Edgefield district, for making and passing counterfeit <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"483\">*483</page-number>Money. The indictment contained two counts. The first charged the prisoner with the counterfeiting, and the other with the passing, <em>or </em>attempting to pass, two false and counterfeit pieces of coin, in the similitude of Spanish milled dollars, composed of lead, pewter, tin, and other mixed metals. There was no evidence given to prove the prisoner guilty of\u2018 the forging, or making ol the pieces of coin in question ; nor was there any evidence to prove, what the different ingredients were, which entered into the composition of the said pieces : But, it was proved, thal the pieces were not true and genuine, but false and base. And it appeared in evidence, that the prisoner passed the two pieces aforesaid, at a gaming table, by betting on the hand of a certain person who was gaming, and lost the same by so betting, to the person to whom the pieces were passed. Wilds, J. charged against the prisoner on the second count, and recommended an acquittal on the first. He overruled the objections which were made at the trial.</summary>\n<summary data-order=\"7\" data-type=\"summary\" id=\"b491-3\">It was insisted for the prisoner, 1st. That losing base money by-gaming, ought not to be considered such a passing, or uttering; as to subject a party to the penalty of a law, so severe as this, under \u2022which the prisoner was indicted. 2d. That the indictment was not proved ; since there was .no evideuce given to prove the composition of the counterfeit pieces so passed, to be of the metals charged in the indictment. 3d. That the jury having found a general verdict on both counts, it ought to be set aside, as it clearly appeared that there was no evidence to support one of the counts, and the court could not tell on which count the juiy have found.</summary>\n<attorneys data-order=\"8\" data-type=\"attorneys\" id=\"b491-4\">Gaixtt and Lesley, for the pnsouer,</attorneys>\n<summary data-order=\"9\" data-type=\"summary\" id=\"A3-t\">cited 1 Bl.

The objection to the want of proof to support the indictment, because the pieces were not proved to be composed of the metals specified in the indictment, was also properly overruled. As to the verdict being general on both counts, when one only was psoved, it is immaterial, as there is one good count to support the verdict. See Doug. 722. The consequence the same, being found guilty on both, as if found guilty on one count only.</p>\n<p id=\"b491-7\">Motion refused.</p>\n<p id=\"ARQm\"><page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"484\">*484</page-number><em>Mote. </em>The A A. 1783, P.
