Upon the resurvey it appeared, that the bluffs, (which were identified,) were not situate on the creek, but upon a marsh, some distance from the creek, which was probably mistaken for the creek on the original location and survey; and that the original marked line could not he traced further than to the bluffs: also, that both the bluffs and creek, could not be established as boundaries, consistently with the apparent intent of the grant. It was determined that the bluffs should be established as boundaries, and the creek was rejected as a boundary not found.</headnotes>\n<summary data-order=\"5\" data-type=\"summary\" id=\"b323-10\">Morion for a new trial.
