Defendant ruled the plaintiffs to shew cause why further proceedings in the action should not be stayed, until the costs of the former action and nonsuit were paid. Plaintiffs shewed cause, and it was ordered by She district <em>court, Johnson, </em>J. pre. siding, that the rule should be discharged, upon the ground, that an executor is not liable to pay costs iu case of nonsuit. Upoij exception taken to this decision, and submitted to this court, it was argued by Nott, in support of the motion, that the general rula which exempts executors from payment of costs, is liable to se. veral exceptions; as where the costs have been incurred by the fault of an executor, in not producing letters testamentary ; or where the action might be maintained in the proper right of such executor. 6 T. R. 654. Cro. Car. 219. 2 Ld. Raym. 1308, 5 T. R. 234 ; or for neglecting to state what the rules of pleading require. See 9 Vin. Abr. 283 \u2014 4. It is a settled rule, where a second action of ejectment is brought after a nonsuit, of course, to order the costs of nonsuit to be paid before the plaintiff shall be allowed to go on to trial in the second action. 2 T. R. 511.</summary>\n<opinion data-order=\"6\" data-type=\"opinion\" id=\"x999-1\" type=\"majority\">\n<author id=\"b182-10\">\n<em>Sed per totam curiam,.</em>\n</author>\n<p id=\"Abz\">It is a matter in general within the dip. cretion of the district court, to order or refuse motions of this sort; and unless this discretion is abused, qr exercised contrary <em>to the </em>rules and principles of law, or the well settled practice of the courts, this court will not regulate or control this discretion. But independently of this reason, this court is fully satisfied that the de. cisi\u00f3n was legally correct, and that to have granted the motion would have been contrary to the authority of adjudged cases. 4 Bur. 1928.
