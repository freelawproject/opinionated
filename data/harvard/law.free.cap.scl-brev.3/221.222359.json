The writ was in debt, requiring the <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"222\">*222</page-number>defendants to answer to the plaintiffs by their several names, without any addition. The declaration alleged that the defendants made their bond or obligation to the plaintiffs, as judges of the county court for Abbevillo county, and their successors in office, &amp;c. and made a profert of the bond, a copy o\u00ed which was filed with the declaration according to the rule of court.</summary>\n<summary data-order=\"8\" data-type=\"summary\" id=\"b230-9\">The defendants pleaded that A.

That since the abolition of county courts, the judges of those courts have uo authority to act in any respect as judges of ordinary, although formerly, during the existence of county courts, sifting as judges in the county courts, they possessed the powers of the court of ordinary : and that their powers as judges of ordinary are by law vested in the present judges of ordinary, who are the successors in office of the county court judges, and are alone competent to sue on administration bonds; and that this bond being sued by men who hav\u00e9 no right to sue, and this appearing upon the face of the proceedings, the court ought to arrest the judgment. The following authorities wore referred to. 1 Vin. Abr. 96, <em>et seq. </em>X Salk. 220. 2 Str. lOe\u00ed). 14 Vin.

As. we have in this state no court of errors properly so called, this court up'\u00f3n all proper occasions will be careful to rectify the proceedings and correct the errors of the district courts. The judgment in this case may be properly arrested for tho error conspicuous on the face of the declaration, which does not set forth any good legal ground of action, but shews clearly that the cause stated as a ground or cause of action is not such a one as enhiles the plaintiffs to maintain it, or to recover judgment. Arrest of judgment is either for matter intrinsic, i. e. such as appears by the record itself, which will render the judgment erroneous and reversible; or extrinsic, i. e. foreign matter suggested to the court which proves the writ is abated : for it is not enough that it proves it only abateable. 1 Salk. 77. 14 Vin. Abr. 028. Here the matter of the judges of the county court being succeded in their office by the judges of ordinary, is intrinsic; but it is also an extrinsic circumstance that they had overpower to take such a bond, or to sue upon it. Those are facts however, which rest in the knowledge of every one, being facts established by positive law, of which the courts are bound to take notice, without requiring any evidence or proof of their existence, and which prove the writ abated;</summary>\n<summary data-order=\"19\" data-type=\"summary\" id=\"b231-8\">The counsel for the plaintiffs did not argue against the motion, but left it to tho judgment of the court.</summary>\n<attorneys data-order=\"20\" data-type=\"attorneys\" id=\"b231-9\">For the defendants, Falconer, and Blasding.</attorneys>\n<opinion data-order=\"21\" data-type=\"opinion\" id=\"x999-1\" type=\"majority\">\n<p id=\"b231-10\">The judges delivered their opinions as follows :\u2014</p>\n<author id=\"b231-11\">Bay, J.</author>\n<p id=\"AQJ\">The principal ground relied,upon in arrest of judgment is, that the suit is brought in the names of the several plaintiffs, with, out naming them as former judges of the county court; and that even if they were named as such, they could not maintain the ac-<page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"224\">*224</page-number>lion, being no longer in office, for that their duties are transferred l&lt;5 the ordinary, in wlrcse name only such suits arc maintainable.</p>\n<p id=\"b232-8\">I am of opinion, that upon the abolition of tho county courts, tlrt\u00ed powers and duties of the county court judges ceased ;. and that by the act of 1799, they were transferred to the ordinary: and con* sequently that the ordinary who succeded the judges of Abbeville county court, succedrc! to all their powers and authorities. I am further of opinion, that this suit, therefore, should have been brought in the name of the ordinary, as successor to the judges of Abbe-ville county.</p>\n<author id=\"b232-9\">Thezevakt, J.</author>\n<p id=\"ARG\">I am of opinion, that the judgment in this case should be arrested ; because \u00a1 t the time this action was brought, tho county courts had been abolished, and ordinaries had been appoint, ed for the new districts : which ordinaries, in their several districts, are <em>to bo </em>considered <em>the </em>successors in office of the <em>judges of </em>tho county courts, so far as relates to the duties and office of ordinaries. This action ought therefore to have been brought in the name of the ordinary of Abbeville district. Holding this opinion, it is unnecessary to decide any other point made in this case.</p>\n<author id=\"b232-10\">Brevard, J.</author>\n<p id=\"AgFP\">In this case, I am of opinion, the judgment ought to be arrested. On all motions of this sort, the court ought to look into the record, to see if it contains sufficient matter to warrant the judgment which is moved to be arrested. Upon examination of the record in this case, it appears faulty from beginning to end. No ob. jeclion, to be sure, could be made to the writ in the first instance; but the declaration upon that writ shows that the plaintiffs had no right to sue in the right they c'aim, or to maintain the action in the capacity in which they prosecute. This court is bound, judicially, to take notice of the abolition of the county courts, and that tho for. mer county court judges, as such, in their capacity of judges of ordinary, have no right or authority to maintain actions upon administration bonds, given to them in their official capacity ; such bonds being made to them as judges for the time being, and to <em>their successors </em>in office. After the abolition of county courts, the officcs of the county court judges became extinct, and consequently their offices of judges of ordinary; wiiich were transferred by an act of 1799, and vested in the ordinaries, or district judges of ordinary, who became their successors in that office. Upon this ground, therefore, that upon the face of the proceedings it appears manifestly to the court, that the plaintiffs are not legally entitled to maintain this action, and that the cause of action therein contained is not sufficient to authorise the court in giving a judgment thereon. I think the motion u arrest the .judgment should be sustained.</p>\n<author id=\"b233-3\"><page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"225\">*225</page-number>Johnson, J.</author>\n<p id=\"AXG\">gave no opinion, having presided at the trial in Abbeville Distiict.</p>\n<author id=\"b233-4\">Waties, J. and Grimke, J,</author>\n<p id=\"Acz\">agt'eed -in opinion with Trezevant, Bay, and Brevard, Justices.</p>\n<p id=\"b233-6\">Judgment arrested.</p>\n<p id=\"b233-7\"><em>Note. </em>It-was decided in this case, at the court antecedent to the decision \u00e1boVo reported, upon i motion to postpone the argument and determination of the' principal motion, founded upon an affidavit stating the want of the record of the proceeediilgs in the cause depending in the district court, that a copy of the affidavit, on which such a motion for postponement is grounded, need not be served on the opposite party, if it appears to the court by affidavit, that the pipers \u00e1re necessary to refer to in the argument arid decision on the principal motion, and that due diligence has been used in order to obtain them, if will be sufficient.</p>\n<p id=\"b233-8\"><em>Note. </em>There is a diversity where the conclusion or demurrer is <em>general, </em>and where <em>special. </em>If the defendant demurs upon a <em>special point, </em>and rehearses the cause of his demurrer, if there be any <em>other matter </em>in the declaration whereof he might have had advantage, he shall not have <em>such </em>advantage: seats whore he concludes or demurs <em>generally. </em>Plowd. 66. <em>Sed quaere: vide 2 </em>Sellon\u2019s Pract. \u00a735.

Plowd. 66, citing 10 Ed. 4, 7. .14 Vin. Abr. 586,</p>\n<p id=\"AiU\">When by tfee replication it appears tbatthe plaintiff has no cause of action, then the plaintiff never shall have judgment, though the bar be insufficient: as in debt upon obligation with Condition to perform covenants in an indenture, defendant pleads performance of all the covenants <em>generally, </em>where it appears to \u2019the court that divers of them a&gt;'e in the negative or disjunctive, and so the plea in the general affirmative is insufficient; yet if the plain .iff replies, and shews a breach of one of the covenants, which of his own shewing is not any breach, upon which defendant demurs, judgment shall be given against plaintiff, because upon the whole record it appears that he has no cause of action. For the bondis conditioned to perform covenants, and he has shewn no breach to give, cause of action, which the law presumes he would have done had there been any. But when-the bar of the defendant Is insufficient in substance, and plaintiff replies and shews the truth .if his case, but shews no matter against himself, hut matter explanatory, or perhaps not material, there the court shall adjudge upon the whole record ; aud the count being good, judgment shall be given for the plaintiff for the insufficiency of the bar, without any regard to the replication: as if a! min pleads a grant by letters patent, which is not material, and defendant demurs in law; in this case judgment shall be given against the defendant. <em>Et sic in similibus. </em>8 Rep. 133, 120; 14 Vin. 587 b. in the notes.
