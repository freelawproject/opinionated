S. Rushton. The defend dants pleaded a surrender of their principal, and concluded their plea with a verification ; whereupon, the plaintiff demurred, and shewed for caus\u00e9 bf demurrer, that such conclusion was ill, and that the same should have been <em>grout gatet per recordum: </em>Defendants joined in demurrer, and this issue was determined by Bay, J. in favoi\u2019 of the plaintiff. The motion in this court,' was argued by Gantt, and Branding, for the defendants; and by Thompson, and Falconer, for the plaintiff. It appeared upon inspection of the proceedings, that the recognizance of special bail was conditioned \u201c to pay the debt, or to render the body of Rushton <em>to the prison </em>of' <em>Abbeville </em>district.\u201d</summary>\n<summary data-order=\"7\" data-type=\"summary\" id=\"b473-11\">For the defendants, it was argued, that the surrender, <em>according to the condition of the </em>recognizance, was a matter <em>in pais, </em>and not determinable by the record; and, therefore, that the conclusion of the plea was proper. If an <em>eononeretur </em>had been regularly entered it would have been otherwise; But it is not always necessary to enter an <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"466\">*466</page-number>exoneretur to obtain a discharge of the bail upon a surrender. I Salk. 101. 6 Mod. 238. I Bur. 409, 339. After a defendant is surrendered, notice thereof ought immediately to be given to the plaintiff\u2019s attorney, and the necessary steps for exonerating the bail taken; but, an omission thereof will not vitiate the surrender, 0 Mod. 238. 1 Sellon, 171.</summary>\n<summary data-order=\"8\" data-type=\"summary\" id=\"b474-10\"><em>E contra. </em>It was insisted, that a surrender must be mutter of record, and tried by the record. 1 Bac. Abr. 218, 3 Vin, Abr. 444, 505. Latch, 149. Poph. 185. Hob. 210. If the bail plead a render of their principal, they must conclude their plea <em>prout patet per recordum,, </em>for this is not to be tried <em>per pais, </em>but by the record.</summary>\n<summary data-order=\"9\" data-type=\"summary\" id=\"b474-11\">Another question was also debated upon this motion which was, whether the district court ought not to have allowed the defendants to have amended their plea, after the decision on the demurrei, by altering the conclusion thereof, according to an application made for that purpose, which was.rejected.\u2019</summary>\n<summary data-order=\"10\" data-type=\"summary\" id=\"b474-12\">For the defendants, was cited 1 Com.

See 6-Mod. 102, and 1. 1 Ld. Raym. 668.</summary>\n<opinion data-order=\"13\" data-type=\"opinion\" id=\"x999-1\" type=\"majority\">\n<p id=\"b474-16\">The Court,</p>\n<judges id=\"AFR\">(Grimke, Waties, Brevard, and Wilds, Justices.)</judges>\n<p id=\"A1EE\">were of opinion, in regard <em>to </em>the point respecting the amendment, that <em>after judgment on demurrer, </em>it was too late to move (o amend, <em>\u00a1Sed quaere de hoc..</em></p>\n<p id=\"b474-17\">Upon the other point, the opinion of the court was, that judgment upon the demurrer, in the district court, ought .to have been for the defendants, because cases may happen, wherein it may be proper to conclude a plea of surrender, with a verification, as where a surren. der has been actually made, and which the bail ought to have the benefit of, but which may, nevertheless, not be entered of record, so as to be pleaded with a <em>prout patet per recordum. Hed quaere.</em></p>\n<p id=\"b474-18\">The judgment given in the district court, on the demurrer, was therefore reversed, and judgment was ordered to be entered for the defendants.</p>\n<p id=\"b474-19\"><em>Note. </em>When the surrender has been made, the hail piece1 shall be marked and discharged, otherwise, the plaintiff'may proeeed against the bail Comb. 263.

See Brown v. Van Deuzer. 10 Johns. 51. Action on recognizance conditioned, that if plaintiff commenced a suit, defendant would appear and put in special bail.
