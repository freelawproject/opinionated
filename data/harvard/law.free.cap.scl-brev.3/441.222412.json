Thai the assured had a right to abandon before conderrinaiion, by the general law, which was not taken away or restrained by the policy ; the po*i. cy only restraining the party, <em>in case of condemnation, </em>to certain proofs, namely,the proceedings of the court, and sentence of con. demoation : but as in this case there was no condemnation, these proofs cannot be required. Then the case, not being restricted by any express agreement of the parties, must be determined by the general rule .of law upon the subject. By the capture, there waa a total loss; and the assured had a right to abandon instantly, and, were not bound to await the final event. The insured may abandon in case merely of an arrest, or embargo, by a prince, not an enemy; and consequent!v such arrest is a loss within the meaning of the word <em>detention. 2 </em>Bur. 696. Burn, 132. Park, 79. No man is bound to await the event of an embargo, or other detention, not warranted by the law of nations as friendly and customary. \u00cdJ Bur. 6M6. 1211. This was an insurance upon the goods <em>for the </em>voyage; and therefore, if either the goods or the voyage was lost, it might be treated as a total loss. The goods, at one period of the voyage, were totally lost. They were afterwards released ; but the voyage was sfar defeated, that if was not worth pursuing. Doug. 219. P&gt;:k. 145. <em>2 </em>Marsh 4M 493. Evans, 36. The further pursuit of the voyage was not worth the freight : the da. mage sustained exceeded one half the value of the prop. rty. The peace duty imposed, might be considered as so much money paid in the nature of salvage; audit the salvage be very high a party may abandon. Doug. 219. The detention at Algesiras forty three days, was <em>not only </em>a great interruption to (be voyage, but occasioned great expense. Suppose the master had gone <em>there </em>volun. tarily, it would have been a <em>deviation. </em>Park, 295. The peace du. ty was imposed after the insurance was made ; and was one of the misfortunes insured against, and happened in consequence of the detention. They also contended, that interest was due from the Sjme of the offer to abandon.</summary>\n<attorneys data-order=\"13\" data-type=\"attorneys\" id=\"b452-9\"><page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"444\">*444</page-number>Pr\u00edngre, Desa\u00fcss\u00fcre, and Cheves, <em>contra.</em></attorneys>\n<summary data-order=\"14\" data-type=\"legal\" id=\"ANN\">First, as to the construction of the contract in the policy, relative to abandonment 5 it must be made on th&lt;- whole clause taken together. The copulative conjunction, \u201c <em>and,\u201d </em>connects what is expressed with regard to capture or detention, with any other power than the British, with what is before expressed m the same sentence, or clause, with regard to capture or detention by the British. The only difference intended was, that in case o\u00ed capture or detention by the British, mo abandonment could take place, without producing the proceedings of the court, and sentence of condemnation ; but in case cf capture or detention by any other power, the production of such documents might be dispensed with, if satisfactory reasons could be given, to shew that they could not be produced. The reason for this difference is obvious. The proceedings of the British tribunals, although often contrary to justice, are always pursuant to the forms of law, and are not difficult to obtain : but this is not the case, in respect to the judicial proceedings of other powers. The words, \u201c until it be condemned,\u201d must be understood, although not expressed, in the latter part of the clause, in the same way which is expressed in the foregoing part, by obvious implication and intendment : and acontrary construction will render the clause inopera, tive. But even admitting the propriety of the construction con. tended for on the other side, the assured in this case were not inti, tied to abandon. Immediately after <em>the </em>capture, it is admitted, the insured might have abandoned, or at any time during the detention of the vessel, because the loss at such time was total. But the offcr to abandon, or notice thereof, was not given in this case until after the vessel was released; and the insured had knowledge of the release of the vessel, at the time when such offer, or notice, was given. The loss, therefore, was not total, when the offer of abandonment was made, and the party had no right then to abandon, Park, 145, 146. <em>2 </em>Bur. 1214. 1 T. R. 191. Evans, 87. No. tice must be given in a reasonable time after the intelligence re. ceived, although there is no precise time limited. Park, 172. Evans, 38. This was not done in this case. But it has been contended, that <em>the voyage </em>was lost, or was not worth pursuing; and therefore, on that ground, the party had a right to abandon. The samo objection as to reasonable notice, applies also to this ground. At the time when the offer to abandon is made, the voyage must appear to be defeated ; but the vessel had <em>then </em>arrived safe at the port of destination, and therefore the voyage was not defeated, but had been \u25a0already pursued. If the injury received at Malaga were ever so <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"445\">*445</page-number>great, yet the vessel and goods remaining, and the voyage being performed, the loss could not by abandonment be rendered total. 1 T. R. 187. For the insurance was on the goods <em>for the voyage. </em>The insured is not obliged to abandon, where he has a right to abandon ; but he has an election, and he ought to make his election speedily. Park, 172. The offer was not made within a reason, able time ; it was not made when the voyage appeared to be defeated : but the same accounts which gave intelligence of rhe capture and deteution, brought intelligence of the release of the vessel and goods. The peril was then over, and the thing insured was in safety. 2 Bur. 1198. Park, 168. 2 Marsh. 594. The right to abandon, must depend on the nature and extent of the damnification as it really is, at the time of the action brought. Hamilton v. Mendes, 2 Bur. 1198. The damage was not so great as to defeat the voyage, or rend, r it not worth pursuing. The injury was partial, and cannot be converted into a total loss by abandonment. No man would desire to abandon in a case, like this, but for one, of two reasons, namely, either becau.-e he is over valued, or because the market has fallen below the o iginal price : and these reasons are conclusive against allowing it. The voyage met with a short, temporary obstruction ; but the ship and cargo were both safe. The expense inemred did not amount to half the value. The pursuit of the voyage was worth at least more than the freight. Park, 145. 2 Bur. 1198. The peace duties did not exceed 50 per cent. But this peace duty was t ot in the contemplation of the policy, and therefore, not one of the perils iusured against. But if it is, it is the subject of partial loss only. The underwr.ters must contribute such a proportion to the whole amount of their subscrip, iion, as the loss, <em>or deterioration </em>sustained, bears to the whole va. lue of the commodity insured. 'Phis being a valued policy, the va. luation comes in lieu of the prime cost. What is the nature of the contract! That the goods shall come safe to the pon of delivery. The goods did arrive safe. The peace duty did not affect the goods. It was not within the policy. The plaintiffs are in titled to recover arateable proportion of the loss sustained, viz. of $1152, as found by the jury, and no more. The peace occasioned the duty, not the deteution. It was a political event not insured against. The consequence of the detention until a peace duty was laid, was not a direct consequence, for if the deteution had not been so long, the duty would net have been incurred : and adjustment cannot de. pend on such contingencies. <em>2 </em>Marsh. 628. The plaintiffs are only jntitled to ayeragofov repairs, &amp;c, at Algesiras. As to interest, it is not <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"446\">*446</page-number>as of course that the plaintiffs can claim interest on the average recovered. The payment of average in this case was not refused, or delayed unreasonably, or against conscience ; but the delay of pay. meot, was in consequence of a dispute between the parties, as to the <em>quantum </em>due. The plaintiffs claimed more than they are <em>intitied </em>to recover : the defendants were always willing to pay what was justly due. After the termination of the disputed point in fa. vor of the defendants, it would be hard to make them pay interest, which did not accrue by their fault. <em>Curia advisare vult.</em></summary>\n<opinion data-order=\"15\" data-type=\"opinion\" id=\"x999-1\" type=\"majority\">\n<p id=\"b454-5\">In December, 1804,</p>\n<author id=\"AOy\">Bkevard, J.</author>\n<p id=\"ALYd\">delivered the unanimous opinion of the judge\u00bb who heard the argument, as follows :</p>\n<p id=\"b454-6\">The principal question submitted to the court, by the special verdict in this case, is, whether the plaintiffs, under the policy of insu* ranee, and all the circumstances of the case, had a right to abandon. The clause in the policy, upon the construction of which the right to abandon is denied, is expressed in these words: \u201c It is further agreed, that no abandonment of the neutral property, hereby insured, shall take place, in case of capture or detention by the British, until it be condemned, and the proceedings of the court, and sentence of condemnation, produced to substantiate the loss : and in case of capture, or detention, by any other power, the like documents shall be produced, unless satisfactory reasons can be given, that they cannot be obtained.\u201d The verdict does not state whether the capture and detention was <em>by the British, or some </em>other power : but it is understood, however, that it toas noi by the British. The opin. ion of the court is, that the true sense of the clause may be thus rendered : That no abandonment of the property insured shall take place, in case of capture or detention by the British, until after con. demnation ; and not until the proceedings of the court, in which the condemnation shall be obtained, have been produced to the insurers, to satisfy them that the property has been condemned in due form : nor in case of capture or detention by any ot bet-1 power, until the like documents have been produced, unless it should appear that they cannot bo obtained. This seems to be the most natural, and reasonable construction, the words can receive. The whole elause should be taken aud construed together. The intent seems to have been, to qualify and abridge tne general right of abandonment. The first part of the clause, concerns captures and detentions by the British: the latter part, concerns captures and detentions by other powers. The laber part cannot be understood, \u25a0without having reference to the former. For what purpose should the proceedings of court, and sentence of condemnation, be pro\u00bb <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"447\">*447</page-number>duced, but to evince the right to abandon <em>1 </em>And when, but at the time the offer to abandon is aide ? There might have been reasons for the distinction made between the British and other powers. The difficulty of procuring the judicial proceedings of the British courts, might not have been so great, as those of 'he tribunals of other powers, from whom capture and detention might have been apprehended. But if the general : &gt;ght to abandon should be granted in this c\u00abse, as unfettered by tins clause in the policy, still I should be of opinion, that the plaintiffs were not entitled to abandon. The verdict does not state at <em>what time </em>the offer to abandon was made, but only, \u201c that the plaintiff., <em>upon the first info mation of the capture and detention, </em>offered to abandon.\u201d L does not appear <em>at what time </em>this first information was received ; nor w hi ther the plaintiffs did not, at the same time, receive intelligence that the vessel was released, and had proceeded on her voyage: and perhaps, that she had arrived in safi-ry at the port of destination. If such intelligence was received, before the offer to abandon \u00bb-is made, and as nothing appears to the contrary, we may conclude that this was the case, t,e plaintiffs bad no right to abundo.,, because the loss did not <em>then </em>appear to be total. Park, 145, 146, 2 Bur. 1214. 1 T R. 191. Evans, 37.</p>\n<p id=\"b455-4\">It has been insisted, however, that as the insuiaiice was <em>upon the goods for the voyage, </em>if it should appear that ei her the goo.,\u00bb, the voyage, were los&lt;, it may be treated as total, provided there a total loss at any period of the voyage : and that as the loss m thi\u00bb case was total at one period of the voyage, by reason of the capture ; and as the voyage was. in consequence thereof, so far defeated, that it was not worth pursuing, tliere/ore it may be treated as a total loss, notwithstanding the sunsequent release of the ship and cargo. But it does not appear that the voy gr- was so far defeated, by reason of any of the perils insured agui..st, as to have been not worth the further pursuit, at the time of the offer to abandon. It is not stated <em>when </em>\u2019he offer to abandon was made. For any tin. g that appears, ii might have been after the vessel had arrived sate in port: after the peril was over, and the gj./ds in safety. If so, and we may presume ihat this was the case, the plai niffs had i.o rg'u to abandon. 2 Bur. 1198. Park, 108. Besides, as the right u&gt; abandon on this ground, depends on the nature and extent of the dam -.fication, and as it does not appear m this case that the da, ng -nslained was, in its nature and extent, sufficient to justny tin piamntis m abandoning m the underwriters, as in case of a total loss, 1 am of opinion they could not do it,</p>\n<p id=\"Ay6\"><page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"448\">*448</page-number>The next question submitted by the special verdict, is, whethef the extraordinary duties laid on the cargo, or goods insured, while detained at Algesiras, should be considered as embraced by the terms of the policy, and chargeable against the underwriters. p0j\u00bfCy subjects the underwriter to responsibility on account of all the usual perils, comprehending \u201c all unavoidable perils, losses and misfortunes, <em>to the damage of the goods.\u201d </em>The peace duty did not affect the goods. It does not appear that they sustained any damage by the event complained of. Tb'-y were subjected to a charge, or duty ; but this was <em>a political event </em>not insured against. The underwriters are bound to know every cause which may occasion natural perils, and also all political dangers. Park, 105. The peace duty cannot be considered as one of the perils insured against.</p>\n<p id=\"A3qG\">The court are, therefore, unanimously of opinion, that the plaintiffs should have jn.'gment for a rateable proportion of the sum of $1152, <em>without interest. </em>The delay ol payment was occasioned by the plaintiffs\u2019 requiring more than was legally due to them ; the defendants were not in default, and oughi not to pay interest.</p>\n<p id=\"b456-6\">Judgment accordingly, for the plaintiffs.</p>\n<judges id=\"b456-7\">Present, Grimke, Waties, 'f rbzevant, and Brevard, Justices,</judges>\n</opinion>\n</casebody>\n",
