The case, brought to the view of the court by the pleadings, was this : The defendant, by a certain deed dated Au-Sust 30, 1789, leased to Morrison &amp; Greenhill, whose assignee the plaintiff is, a lot of land m Charleston, for nine years, at the yeariy rent o\u00ed JS18, sterling, and to pay the taxes. Morrisun &amp; Greenhill therein covenant to build, tad completely finish, on the premises, a dwelling house, kitchen, &amp;c.; and at the expiration of the nine years, to surrender the premises and buildings to the defendant, her executors, &amp;c. And it was agreed by and between the parties, that at the expiration of the nine years, the buildings to be erected should be fairly valued at a cash price, by persons chosen, &amp;c. And the defendant agreed to pay to Morrison &amp; Greenhill, or one of them, or their executors, &amp;c. or <em>assigns, </em>the estimated value of the buildings. And if it should not. be convenient for her then to pay the same, that the premises should be leased out under her direction, and the rents paid to. Morrison &amp; Green, hill, or their assigns, until the said estimated value of the said buildings should be paid. In 1798, the buildings erected pursuant to the abovementioned contract, were valued by persons indifferently chosen by the parties, and estimated at \u00a31387, Gs. 6d. The defendant, Miss Elliott, did not pay the same, nut chose to avail herself of the proviso in the deed, which obliges the plaintiff to raise the same out of the rents and profits of the premises. The ques. tion arising out of the case was, whether the plaintiffs were inlitled to interest upon the sum at which the buildings were valued, from the time it was ascertained, or not.</summary>\n<attorneys data-order=\"7\" data-type=\"attorneys\" id=\"b432-7\">Pringle, for the plaintiffs,</attorneys>\n<summary data-order=\"8\" data-type=\"legal\" id=\"ALAt\">contended, that upon the valuation being made at the expiration of the term, the estimated sum was a debt liquidated, and payable immediately. The defendant, how. ever, had an election to pay the debt at once, or to postpone the payment, and let the plaintiffs collect the same from the accruing rents. The valuation being \u201c at a cash price,\u201d shews clearly that it was the intent of the parties, that it should be paid at once, unless the defendant should chose the other alternative, in which case, as this was for her benefit, the plaintiffs, in point of fairness and reciprocity, should have an equivalent for. the delay of payment, and being kept out of the use of the money. This equivalent should be equal to logal interest. If (be plaintiffs are not allowed interest, it will take several years to pay the valuation out of the rents, which cannot be regarded as a reasonable equivalent or compengation. '</summary>\n<attorneys data-order=\"9\" data-type=\"attorneys\" id=\"b432-8\">Parker, contra.</attorneys>\n<summary data-order=\"10\" data-type=\"legal\" id=\"AEem\">The defendant had a clear election, either to <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"425\">*425</page-number><em>b&amp;vance </em>the appraised sum, if it suited her, or if it did not, to insist bn the appraised sUm being paid out of the rents. There is nothing said about interest in the contract. The defendant is not <em>personally </em>liable. Interest is not recoverable, unless stipulated to be paid by the Contract, or by way of damages for a breach of contract. In the latter case, it is only the <em>measure </em>of damages. In this case, interest cannot be claimed on either ground. To allow a compensation, as <em>interest, </em>would ,be varying the contract. The ,im. equality of the contract is not a sufficient reason to authorize the court to <em>alter it. </em>Even in equity it.cannot be done, <em>simply </em>on .this ground. The contract is clear and certain, and interest .cannot be allowed, by any construction, as being intended to-be included there, in ; and the maxim, \u00ab <em>ubi in, verbis nulla ambiguitas est, ibi nulla eonstructio contra verba fienda estf </em>applies. When the deed says that the rent shall be received by the lessee, in discharge of the ap. praised sum, it is contradictory to say, that it shall be applied to <em>the payment of interest on </em>that sum, m the first instance. The words, \u201c cash price,\u201d used in the contract, furnish scarcely a shadow of a presumption, that interest was intended. These words were pro* bably used without any relation to interest, and merely to fix the <em>real value </em>of the buildings, by the most certain standard. Interest not being mentioned expressly, there is good reason to suppose, it was not intended to be inserted in the contract. A deed cannot be varied by parol evidence; nor ought it to be by the surmises of the court, where there is nothing doubtful or ambiguous in it. In. terest cannot be recovered by way of damages, because the contract, on the part of the defendant, has not been violated. The rents have not been withheld. The demurrer admits the regular receipt of the rents by the piaintiff. There is not any personal contract on the part of the defendant to pay tht appraised sum, even with the rents ; but the contract is, that Morrison &amp; Gi eenhill may receive, &amp;c. This amounts to a covenant on the part of the defend, ant, that she will not prevent them from leceiving, until the appraised sum shall be satisfied.</summary>\n<opinion data-order=\"11\" data-type=\"opinion\" id=\"x999-1\" type=\"majority\">\n<author id=\"b433-10\">The court</author>\n<p id=\"AJeP\">were of opinion, that the plaintiffs were not intitled to interest, for the reasons urged by the defendant\u2019s counsel: and confirmed the judgment of the district court.</p>\n<judges id=\"b433-11\">Present, Grimke, Waties, Tbezevant, and Bbevabd, Justices.</judges>\n</opinion>\n</casebody>\n",
