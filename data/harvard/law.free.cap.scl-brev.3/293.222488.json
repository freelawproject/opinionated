The judge oveiruled the exceptions, and refused to order the award to be reconsidered ; and he said, that it was the settled,doctrine of our courts net to allow awards o\u00ed arbitrators to be impeached, except lor partiality, cor-, ruptioo, or other misbehaviour o\u00ed the arbitrators, which -was not suggested in this case; or for some evident mistake appearing on the face of the award. That if the arbitrators themelves, or a majority of them, would come forward and express their dissatisfaction with the award, and offer to explain some mistake, or miscalculation which they had involuntarily committed, it would be a good cause lor sending them out again, or refer\u00ed mg ihe matter back to them, to reconsider their award ; or, even for refusing to affirm the award, without sending it back to be reconsidered. But as this was not the case in the present instance, the rule was ordered to be made absolute.</summary>\n<attorneys data-order=\"8\" data-type=\"attorneys\" id=\"AaRV\">Branding, for the defendant.
