November, 1804. The action was trespass to try titles to land. The declaration stated that the trespass was committed in a tract of three hundred and twenty-three acres of land, originally granted, to one John Hood. At the trial, the plaintiff produced and proved a conveyance from John Hood, the son and heir at law of John Hood, the patentee, for the whole land. He also proved that the said grantee died intestate, in the year 1799, leaving a widow, and two other children, besides the said John, the son.</summary>\n<summary data-order=\"7\" data-type=\"summary\" id=\"b554-9\">Upon this evidence the defendant moved that the plaintiff should be nonsuited, as by the act of distributions of the year 1791, immediately upon the death of J. Hood, the grantee, the land in question descended to his widow and children, in co-parcenary, and the son, John, became entitled thereupon, to an undivided third part of two thirds of the said land, or two ninths, and no more ,- and that as he could convey no more, his conveyance of the whole was either void, as being for more than he could rightfully convey, or it was good only <em>pro tanto, </em>or for such part as he could rightfully convey; and therefore that the evidence did not prove the title set forth in the declaration.</summary>\n<summary data-order=\"8\" data-type=\"summary\" id=\"b554-10\">The motion for a nonsuit being overruled, the defendant then gave in evidence a grant from the State to one Samuel Littlejohn, for four hundred and eighty acres of land, situate on Cedar Creek, waters of Broad river, the date of which grant was anterior to the date of Hood\u2019s grant; and offered to prove that the land described in the grant to Littlejohn, included the land in question, and that the survey thereof was actually made of lands lying on Cedar Creek, waters of Wateree river, and not waters of Broad river, as erroneously expressed in the grant; but the court refused to admit evidence to contradict the grant, or to prove that the land described in the grant, lay on the waters of the Wateree river, when the grant clearly expresses that it lies on the waters of Broad river.</summary>\n<judges data-order=\"9\" data-type=\"summary\" id=\"b554-11\">The motion in this court was argued in November, 1804, before <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"547\">*547</page-number>Waties, Bay, Trezevant, and Brevard, Js., who took time to Consider of their opinion.

To shew by evidence <em>dehors </em>the patent, the true meaning of the same,1 That the place, or land, and lines, mentioned and described in the patent, and survey thereunto annexed, must, from necessity, in all cases, be located and identified by witnesses who are to testify in, court concerning the same; and as such evidence is, from the necessity of the case, in almost every case required, so in some cases the same necessity may exist, to allow of evidence which will show' that the description in the patent is incorrect, and that the land actually surveyed, as mentioned in the patent, and granted, lies in a different place, or that the lines, as described, run in a different direction. This kind of evidence is necessary to give effect to the, patent, and not to render it null, or impair it. Without the admission of such evidence the land actually granted could not be found, and the boundaries thereof ascertained.</p>\n<p id=\"b555-8\"><em>Note. </em>See 3 Bin. 109, S..P. accordant. <em>7 </em>Johns. 341. 3 Caines, 169.
