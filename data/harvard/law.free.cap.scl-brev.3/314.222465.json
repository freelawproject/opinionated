Plaintiff brought <em>assumpsit </em>for money-had, &amp;c. which was tried in Charleston district, before Bay, J. The evidence given in maintenance of the action was, that a Mr. Mainvielle, deceased, in his lifetime, occasionally lodged at the house of the plaintiff, Madame Curtois ; but often furnished her with firewood, and used to go to market himself, and purcbars; meat, &amp;c., and did not charge for the same. But, it appeared that the defendant, who married Mainvieile\u2019s daughter, and only child, before he received from the administrator of M.dnvii-lle the assets of the estate, promised to pay the plaintifl\u2019s demand ; and, the plaintiff thereupon, consented that the administrator should deliver to defendant the assets. The ground of action was, the <em>acknowledgment of the defendant, </em>that so much was due, and <em>his promise to pay, </em>in consideration of assets in his hands, <em>delivered up to him by </em>the administrator of Mainvielle for this purpose. The judge who presided at the trial, expressed doubts if any thing was due, but left it to the jury; who found for the plaintiff. Several objec. tions were taken to the verdict, and the plaintiff\u2019s right to recover. 1. That no account was produced, to shew the nature and particulars of the debt. 2. The presumption, arising from the evidence, that nothing was really due. 3. That the defendant\u2019s promise was not binding by the statute o\u00ed frauds. 4. The want of consideration. 5. That the remedy, <em>if </em>any, was against the admi. nistrator.</summary>\n<opinion data-order=\"6\" data-type=\"opinion\" id=\"x999-1\" type=\"majority\">\n<p id=\"b322-7\">The court, after hearing argument by Gaillard, for the motion, and Bailey, <em>contra, </em>were of opinion, that the undertaking of defendant was direct, and not collateral, and made upon sufficient consideration ; and, being for a sum certain, was good and effectual <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"315\">*315</page-number><em>to </em>bind him to a peiformance; and, therefore, refused a new trial.
