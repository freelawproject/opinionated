After a decree was made for the plaintiff, the bail to the sheriff, for the appearance of the defendant, moved for leave to enter himself special bail, in order to intitle himself to surrender the deiendant, in his own discharge; which was refused. The motion in this court, was to correct the decision of the district court on that point.</summary>\n<opinion data-order=\"6\" data-type=\"opinion\" id=\"x999-1\" type=\"majority\">\n<author id=\"b489-11\">But the court,</author>\n<judges id=\"AWx\">(Grimke, Waties, Bay, and Brevard, Justices,)</judges>\n<p id=\"Aaj\">being of opinion, that the bail to the sheriff, after a decree entered en <em>sum. process, </em>which is the only judgment which is ever entered up, or signed, in such case, cannot be admitted to become special bail, and be intitled to surrender, refused the motion.</p>\n<p id=\"b489-12\"><em>Note </em>By A.

The usual judgment is by a decree, given by parol in court, and entered on the minutes by the clerk, <em>instanter, </em>in court. By A A. 1793, it is declared, that decrees on <em>s.um. pro. duly </em>docketed, shall be effectual to bind lands, &amp;e., as <em>other judgments.-</em></p>\n</opinion>\n</casebody>\n",
