R, 470; and insisted, note itlistuudh-g the casi-s iu the books, that the word <em>or, </em>ought not to be chang, d into the word <em>and, </em>or con. Strued to have the same meaning as <em>and. </em>in this will; as it would be contrary to a decision made by Buuke, Waters, and Bay. Justices, in a similar will, under similar circumstances, in the case of M\u2019Crea v. Mason, in Charleston. Because, that determination had settled an important rule of property; and, whether it was rightly settled or not, ought not now to be. a question, as it was better the rule so settled, whether right or wrong at first, should be adhered to, than that it should be overturned, and remain un. certain. That, in the case of M\u2019Crea v. Mason, the court deter, mined, that the word <em>or, </em>must be construed according to its literal <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"321\">*321</page-number>9-nd grammatical import.'This determination was generally known, and long considered as law, and, therefore, it would be dangerous to overturn it, and introduce a mischievous uncertainty. 2 Ver. 11, 388, 1 Ld. Kaym. 505. And estates may have been purchased, relying upon the establishment and permanency of the rule of construction, adopted in our courts, contrary to the decisions, in similar cases, in England. That the decision in the case of IVl\u2019Crea v. Mason, was \u00f3n the construction of the wid of F. Godard, the words of which, were : \u201c I give, &amp;c. to my four Children above mentioned, all the remainder and residue of my estate, (personal property,) to be equally divided,- share and share alike : but, in case either of my children die minors, <em>or without </em>leaving- lawful heir from their body,' their parts of my estate to revert to my surviving children, and to be equally divided amongst them.\u201d Mason married one of the daughters, who died after attaining twenty-one, without issue. The surviving sister married M\u2019Crea, who recovered. The construction of wills must be governed by what appears to have been the intention of the testator. This, is a rule paramount,- which will force its way through all restraints: and the courts may construe the words in question either way, in order to effectuate the intention. The only reason' why <em>or, </em>has been construed to mean <em>and, </em>has been, because otherwise, the grandchildren of the testator would be disinherited, or cut off from any share of the testator\u2019s bounty^ which the testator could not be presumed to intend. But herepthere are \u00bfV grandchildren to suffer by the plain meaning- of the devise in this case'. 8 Atk. 193, Cro. Eliz. 505, Moore 422, 3 Atk: 389, 3 T. R. 470, Every will must depend on its own peculiar circumstances because, no two wills are exactly alike. Or, should siever be changed into <em>and, </em>except to effectuate a plain and maui. fest intent, not a problematical intent;- and. it is not fair t\u00f3-predicate a construction, or a supposed, or imaginary state \u00f3f things, which exists not. in the case, although it might have happened. The mischief to be avoided by a strained construction is, the estate going over to a stranger, to the prejudice of kindred. By adverting to other parts of the will, it appears the testator has used the word <em>and, </em>instead of the word <em>or, </em>in one place, which shews that he knew the difference between them. 2 Vent. 388. Every will must deBend on its own circumstances. The case of M\u2019Crea v. Mason, however, is so much like this, that there can be'no reason for giving a different decision in this case, from what was given in that. The plain and natural reading and sense ought fo prevail.</summary>\n<summary data-order=\"8\" data-type=\"summary\" id=\"b329-7\">For the defendants it was insisted, that in the construction of\u2019 <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"322\">*322</page-number>wills, reference must be had to what the testator may reasonably\"\u2019 he supposed to have intended at the time of making his will; and every thing ought to he co. sidered which might reasonably, in the course of human events, have taken place ; and ought not to depend ou the event, or what may actually take place. Therefore the decision in the case of M\u2019Crea v. Mason, was clearly wrong ; because if Mason\u2019s wife ha J died under age, hut leaving issue, by the construction adopted in that case, her children could not take, which the testator could not be supposed to intend. Whereas, if the woH <em>or </em>had been construed <em>and, </em>the grandchildren might have taken, and the estate would uot run the risk of going over to a stranger. The case of M\u2019Crea v. Mason, ought therefore to be reviewed. It never had been satisfactory to the bar, and certainly was contradictory to numerous decided cases in the English books of reports. It was also contrary to two cases previously adjudged in our own courts since die Revolution, viz. Pawley arid Allston, orfthe will of Sprey; and Osborn v. Ferguson. In the former case,- the words of the will were, \u201c to my son, Joseph. Sprey, and his heirs and assigns, to be delivered him when he arrives to the age of twenty one, or day of marriage, which shall happen first : but <em>if lie should die before twenty one, or hath no lawful issue, </em>then over.\u201d lu these cases, counsel had advised according to the authorities of decisions in England, and the courts decided accordingly. The court ought now to oveirule the case of M Crea v. Mason, if, upon a full review of all the cases, it should he found to have been made ou mistaken ground. The Courts in England had not scrupled to do so ou similar occasions, wherever it had appeared necessary : as in the case of Marshall v. Rutter, which ovenhiew the principle established by the court, in the case of Poelmtz and Corbet, although mauy decisions had been made on the authority o\u00ed the latter case. Besides, the case of M\u2019Crea v. Mason, has never been regarded as having settled the doctrine on the subject, but has only served to confound the opinions of counsel, and render still moreobscuie and uncertain, the rule of construction in such cases. Where the intention is clear, there is no occasion for any other rule of construction than this, <em>that the intention shall prevail, if consistent with </em>the rules of law. But where the intention is doubtful, some rule of construction \u2022ought to be resorted to, for the sake of uniformity and consistency. The construction ought never to depend on the event, or on circumstances happening after the death of the testator, and which, could not be foreseen, or supposed to be provided for. Doug.; <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"323\">*323</page-number>477, 482, 494 499, note. The construction must, regard the circumstances existing at the time of the making of the will; or as it ought to have been at the time of the testator\u2019s death. Subsequent events ought to have no weight in determining the intent. The construction ought not to varv and shift with the events that occur. 5 Bur. 2703. 1 Atk. 426. The estate here is limited to go over upon the happening of two contingent events, viz : dying under twenty one, <em>and </em>without issue, and both events must occur, before the <em>estate </em>shall go over. 1 Atk 193. It was so decided in the late case between Laochesfer &amp; Strierdon, on this very will. The principle of the rule of construction which is discr n\u00fable in all the cases, t\u00ed, <em>to preserve ilie estate in the family, and provide for grandchildren. </em>Whether gruudchddre.i are in fact born or not. can mnlce no differcoce, if according to the common course of things, and in all human prof ability, grandchildren might have been horn after the making of the will, or lhe death -4'the testator. But in this case there is an additional reason why the word <em>or </em>should be construed to mean and, which is. that the testator has used both words <em>indifferently </em>aud <em>indiscriminately </em>in the same sense, as words of similar import, in the same will. It does not appear that he understood any difference in their signification, as he has used them. It is not to be presumed that he intended to restrain his daughters from marrying under twenty one, and per. mit his sons to marry under that age, because he could have no reason for it. Tlv meaning or intent must be collected from the whole will taken together; and the general intent must control the particular intent. The case of Fraud\u00e9.gham v. Brand, 3 Atk. 390, and the case of Peterson v. Walsh. 3 Atk. 193. sltew clearly the rule, and reason of the rule. 2 Stra. 1175. Pollex. 645. See Sanders\u2019 new edition of Atk.

The court having considered the arguments offered in the foregoing cases of Munro, <em>et al </em>&amp; Holmes, aud Munro, <em>et al. </em>&amp; Pritchard, and advised thereon, de. livered an opinion, in substance as follows : Upon a careful examination of the will in question, there can be nothing found to <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"324\">*324</page-number>induce a belief that the testator intended, in case either of his daughters sh &gt;uld marry, a&gt; d die under twenty one, leaving issue, such isMie should take nothing under his bequest; yet if such an event had happeued, according to the literal construction contended for, the grandchildren of the testator would not be entitled to take. It is immaterial whether the event actually took place ,or not: it might have happened. It is not to be presumed that the testator l\u00f3resaw it would not happen, in the subsequent part bf the will, the word <em>and </em>appears to be used in the same sense as the word <em>or, </em>in the part in question ; and it does not apppar tha| the testator was aware, of their different meanings and legal effect. His daughters were all equally the objects of his bounty. It cannot be supposed he meant to restrain them from marrying under twenty one, and yet permit his sons todo so. And if not, he certainly' could not intend to leave the issue of such as might die under that age unprovided for. It would be an unnatural and uncharitable supposition, and therefore inadmissible. If this was not his intention, he has made a mistaken use of the word or, and should have instead thereof inserted the word <em>and, </em>so as to couple the two contingencies together, and not disjoin them : and then the bequest intended for his daughters, in the event of either of them dying would not go over u- less she died under twenty one, <em>and </em>unless she died without lawful issue. This construction is fully warranted by the apparent intent of the testator, to be collect\u00bb \u00e9d from his whole will taken together, and by the authorities produced. A distinction, to be sure, prevails in England between devises of real estate and bequests of personal estate, and chattels real, founded on the partiality which is ever shown to the <em>heir </em>at law. But whatever foundation there may be in England for such a distinction, there is certainly none here. All the kindred, in equal degree, are heirs at law', and equally entitled ; and the ground of distinction which exists in England, has no existence with us. The construction which has obtained in relation to personal estate, to effectuate the intention of the testator, is founded in reason am| justice, and applies on this occasion. Judgment for defendants,</p>\n<p id=\"b332-4\"><em>Note. </em>In Walsh v. Peterson, 3 <em>Atk. 193, </em>the words were \u201cto P,, his heirs, and assigns, forever; but in case he dies before he shall attain the age of twenty one, <em>or without issue, </em>then <em>ever.\" </em>P died after twenty one, without issue.

Dying in mijnority 2 Dying unmarried 3 Dying wi.hout issue. Because, should that eonstruction prevail, had R. married and had issue, and had died uuder age, .the issue would have been disinherited, which would contradict the general intent of the will. And the Lord &lt; hancellor said that there was but one contingency, attended with'two qualifications, of his being unmarried, or dying without issue: and .the word oy has reference to the different qualifications that may happen during the minority, which are all tied up to li\u2019s. dying under age.

C. 185, and other cases in Crake, where the court proceeded on the notion, that it was not ^the intent to disinherit the issue, and therefore <em>or </em>should be construed <em>and.</em></p>\n<p id=\"b333-6\">In Wright v Kemp, 3 T.

The court held that it was only one contingency, and rejected the word <em>or </em>marriage; and cited Price v Hunt, Pollex 645, where the word <em>or </em>was consumed conjunctively, See 1 Stra. 427. 2 Eq.
