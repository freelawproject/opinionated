A. 1748. P. L. 218 ; which objection was sustained, and the return was rejected. The motion in this court, was to reverse this determination of the district court.</summary>\n<opinion data-order=\"6\" data-type=\"opinion\" id=\"x999-1\" type=\"majority\">\n<author id=\"b490-10\">\n<em>Per Curiam.</em>\n</author>\n<judges id=\"AQtb\">(Grimkje, Waties, Bay, and Brevard, Justices.)</judges>\n<p id=\"Aqh\">The decision of the district court was correct. The act o\u00ed 1748, authorizes the issuing of a writ, to be directed to five persons, who shall make partition, and shall make a return of the writ, under their hands and seals; but it does not authi-rize a majority of the five persons to do so. Wherever the law empowers a certain number of persons to do a joint act, they must all concur therein It was so decided in the case of the commissioners of inspection for Campbleton warehouse.

Where the legislature does not expressly require a joint execution of a power, and it would he attended with inconvenience <em>to </em>obtain it, the above construction does not hold. See Co.
