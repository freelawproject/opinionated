And if there be no guardian to such infant' heir (or heirs,) then to the administrator of the deceased, who may be summoned, as well as the persons of age who are entitled to a share,'and the guardians of such infants as have guardians ; and Where the deceased has no administrator, then to any other person, or persons, (all persons holding jointly or severally,) who may be in the possession of any of the said lands.
