The sale during the life time of the tenant for life, was not a conversion of the property of the <em>remainderman ; </em>nor was the failure to deliver upon a demand, made when the property was no longer in possession of the purchaser, a conversion after the remainderman\u2019s right accrued: and even if the purchaser were bound by the covenants of the <em>cestuy que vie, </em>or as trustee for the remainderman, yet <em>trover </em>is not the remedy for breach of covenant, or trust. '</headnotes>\n<summary data-order=\"5\" data-type=\"summary\" id=\"b407-5\">This was an action of trover, foi- certain slaves, and was tried in Charleston district. The jury found a special verdict, which stated, that the negroes in question we/re included in a settlement made by the plaintiff\u2019s father on her, in 1782, by which the same negroes were limited to the father for life, and after his death were then to go to the plaintiff. That afterwards the said father, many years before his death, sold the same negroes absolutely for a full consideration to the defendant, assuring the defendant that they were free of any incumbrance. The defendant afterwards sold the same negroes to another person, by whom they weve taken and carried into Georgia, where they then were at the time of the trial. That all these events occurred in the lifetime of the plaintiff\u2019s father: and that after his death, viz. in 1^02, and shortly before the commencement of this action, the defendant had notice of the plaintiff\u2019s claim, and the negroes were demanded of him. He answered, that he had them not in his possession or power, and therefore could not deliver them. The verdict also stated, that the deed of settlement was duly recorded in the Secretary of State\u2019s office.</summary>\n<attorneys data-order=\"6\" data-type=\"attorneys\" id=\"b407-6\">Pringle, for the plaintiff.</attorneys>\n<summary data-order=\"7\" data-type=\"legal\" id=\"Aiqh\">The father, tenant for life, was trustee for the rem tinder man, the plaintiff, the <em>cestuy que </em>use.

His refusal, upon demand, to deliver the negroes to the plaintiff, is good evidence of conversion, it was his own fault that he had not the <em>negroes in </em>his possession, or power,'to comply with the demand; and, he shall not be permitted to take advantage of his own wrong. The covenant in the deed bound the defendant, who is an assignee under it.. He should have taken care that the property should be forthcoming upon the det.th of the tenant for life, or <em>cestuy que vie. </em>His not having done so was <em>crassa negligentia. </em>Cited 6 Bac.

But the defendant has not been guilty of'any conversion. It has been said, lie could acquire no greater estate by the purchase, than the purchaser had. He could dispose of no more; and, there, fore, when he sold, he sold only what he had a right to sell, viz. the life estate. When he sold, the tenant for life was alive; and, therefore, he had a right to sell, for the life estate which he bought still existed.</summary>\n<opinion data-order=\"10\" data-type=\"opinion\" id=\"x999-1\" type=\"majority\">\n<author id=\"b408-10\">By the court.</author>\n<p id=\"AnW\">An action of trover must be founded in the property of the plaintiff, 1 T. R. 56; and the <em>right, of property </em>will draw with it the actual possession. Latch, 214. But, it is necessary, in order to maintain this action, to prove, not only that the plain, tiff had a property, either general or special, in the thing for which the action was brought; but, also, that the defendant was in possession, and converted the properly to his own use. The conver. sion is the <em>gist </em>of the action ; for, it is the conversion that makes* <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"401\">*401</page-number>the defendant a wrongdoer, and not the trover, or finding, or being in possession. In this case, it does not appear that the defendant ever wrongfully converted to his own use the property of <em>the plaintiff, </em>It has been contended, that the selling the negroes absolutely, when he had only the use of them for the life of another, was an illegal conversion of the <em>whole right in the property, </em>and consequently, a conversion of the remainder, or residue, or contingent right, vested in the plaintiff; which was a wrongful conversion <em>pro </em>tanto. But there is no doctrine of law to maintain this position. The right <em>of </em>the plaintiff was a mere possibility. The negroes might all have died before the tenant for life. The tenant for life could dispose of no more than his life estate; and the subsequent purchasers from him, and claiming under him, could obtain no greater estate, or right, than he could dispose of. He had a right to dispose of his life estafe; and the person who purchased his right, could lawfully dispose of it. The possession of the negroes followed these several transfers as a matter of course : and therefore, during the life of the tenant for life, or of him to whom the property was limited for life, there could be no conversion to the prejudice of the plaintiff. If the negroes had been put to death, or improperly deteriorated, by the person* intitled to the use of them for life, or by another, trover would not be the proper remedy for the person intitled to them after the death of the <em>cestui que vie: </em>for he had no property in them at the time, and therefore, no right of action coilld accrue to him. The right to maintain this action, ne'cessarily involves the right of possession, as well as the right of property ; but, the right of property draws with it <em>the </em>possession. In this Case, it cannot be pretended that the plaintiff, at the time of this supposed conversion, was intitled to the <em>possession </em>of the negroes in question. The right of property and possession was hot then Violated by the sale made by the defendant.</p>\n<p id=\"b409-4\">But it has been further contended, that after the death of the <em>cestuy que vie, </em>it was the duty of the defendant to have delivered up the ne\u25a0groes upon demand: and that a refusal, or failure, by him to deliver upon demand, he being legally bound to deliver, amounts to a conversion, bj construction and operation of FlW. This position is equally untenable. At the time when the plaintiff became intitled to the property, the negroes were not id, the possession, or subject to the control, of the defendant. \u00c1. milting that he was bound by the; Covenants of the <em>cestuy que, vie, </em>fr.,m whom he bought, or as trustee for the remainder.;.y.u, ii does not follow that he is liable in oe fen action of trover for a breach of covenant, or trugt..
