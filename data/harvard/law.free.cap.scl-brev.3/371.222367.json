And where the donor acknowledged that <em>he had given </em>certain slaves to his daughter, in her presence, and when she had one of the slaves, then an infant, in her arms; and there was proof of repeated prior declarations by him of his intention to give the same slaves to the same daughter: <em>held, </em>that this was sufficient proof, of a gift of all the slaves mentioned, to be submitted to a jury.</headnotes>\n<summary data-order=\"5\" data-type=\"summary\" id=\"b379-8\">Motion to set aside a nonsuit, and grant a new trial. This was an action of <em>trover, </em>for certain negro slaves, tried before Trezbvant, J. in Marion district, last circuit. It appeared, from the report of the judge, that the defendants\u2019 testator had Signified at different times, that he intended to give the negroes in question to his daughter, the plaintiff, Davis ; and that there was evidence given that one of the negroes, when a child, being in the arms of the testator\u2019s said daughter, her mother observed, that her daughter ought to have those negroes, speaking of the negroes in question, to certain persons present, and went on further to mention, that her father had given them to his daughter. The father being present, answered, that it was already done, or that he had already given them to his daughter. There was some evidence <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"372\">*372</page-number>that the testator intended, or' had reserved, a life estate in the negroes, to himself. But there was no proof of an actual gift, accompanied with delivery : and for this-deficiency of proof, the judge ordered a non-suit.</summary>\n<attorneys data-order=\"6\" data-type=\"attorneys\" id=\"b380-8\">Falconer, for the plaintiffs,</attorneys>\n<summary data-order=\"7\" data-type=\"legal\" id=\"A3Ua\">insisted that the evidence was proper to be left to the jury, in support of the plaintiffs\u2019 right of action, as evidence of the property in them ; and that the judge had mistaken the law on the subject: for although a parol gift, <em>without some act of delivery, </em>is not good, yet here the jury might fairly presume, that there was some act of delivery ; and the conversation relative to the gift, at the time when one of the uegroes was in the arms of the donee, might be construed into a sufficient act. of delivery. 2 Str, 950.

And that it would be an idle waste of time, to suffer such insufficient evidence to go to the jury.</summary>\n<opinion data-order=\"10\" data-type=\"opinion\" id=\"x999-1\" type=\"majority\">\n<author id=\"b380-10\">By the court.</author>\n<p id=\"AjT\">Parol gifts to a child are common ; and it has not been usual to evidence such gifts by any solemn act of delivery. The formal ceremony of a delivery is not <em>essentially </em>necessary. It is sufficient, if it appear, that the donor intended an actual gift at the time, and evidenced such intention by <em>some act, </em>which may fairly be construed into a delivery : as in the case cited from Strange, where the donee was put into possession, by being intrusted with the key, &amp;c. In the principal case there was evidence given, which was proper for the jury to consider as evidence of an actual delivery. The donor acknowledged that he had given the negroes to his daughter, when questioned on the subject, and at a time when she had one of them in her arms. This was, in itself, evidence of a delivery, or surrender of his right to his daughter: and accompanied with other circumstances, might be deemed sufficient proof of a prior delivery of all the negroes in dispute.</p>\n<p id=\"b380-11\">Nonsuit set aside, and a new trial granted.</p>\n<judges id=\"b380-12\">Present, Grimke, Waties, Johnson, Trezevant, and Breyard, Justices; Bay, J. absent.</judges>\n<p id=\"b381-3\"><page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"373\">*373</page-number><em>Note. </em>By the civil law, a gift of goods is not good without delivery; yet it is otherwise in our law.
