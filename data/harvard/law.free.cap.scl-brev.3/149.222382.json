The insurance was on a schooner \u00e1t and from\u2019 Jamaica to Charleston. The vessql sailed from Jamaica in' December, and kept company with other vessels a few days ; she then drifted upwards of a hundred leagues, and fan upon a rock of coral on the coast of Campeachy, and was lost. . . . \u25a0</summary>\n<summary data-order=\"6\" data-type=\"summary\" id=\"b157-10\">The defence turned on her sea-worthiness at the time of the insurance. ' To' this point 'there' were three witnesses, certifying t'o circumstances, and delivering it as their opinion, that the vessel was not sea-worthy ; and three witnesses,' on the other side, deposed to circumstances, and delivered opinions of an opposite tendency. \u25a0 The testimony,' however, of one of the plaintiff\u2019s principal witnesses was somewhat suspicious ; and his credibility was rendered doubtful frQm'many circumstances which appeared to be true, and which were inconsistent with material facts he had sworn to. The jury found for the plaintiff; and this was a motion' to s\u00e9t aside the yerdict, and for a new trial. <em>'</em></summary>\n<attorneys data-order=\"7\" data-type=\"attorneys\" id=\"b157-11\">J.

Although a vessel is apparently staunch and sound, when insured, yet if she prove otherwise directly after, the underwriters shall not suffer. And the counsel cited, 2 Esp, Rep. 692, to shew, that the credibility of a witness maybe impeached by what he has said or written, inconsistent with what he swears at the trial.

If she be not seaworthy when she sails, the un\u2022'derwriters shall be discharged, though the vessel should be captured. It may be conceded, that the insured <em>toarrants </em>the vessel to b\u00a3 sound when insured; and that it matters not, whether the <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"150\">*150</page-number>real state of the vessel is represented to tho underwriters or not ? or whether the insured is acquainted with the unsoundness or not. Cowp. 148. This doctrine is admitted to be sound, but its application the present case is denied. Here there was contradictory evidence. The credibility of the witnesses, and the weight of evidence, were proper subjects for the investigation and consideration of the jury ; and the whole of the evidence, on both sides, was fairly laid before them, and they have decided thereon. The judge, at the trial, might have been of a different opinion from the jury; but his opinions on matters, of fact ought not to control theirs. Thq jurors, and not the judge, aro the constitutional and legal judges of such matters. It is for them to decide on the credibility of testimony delivered to them, and estimate the comparative weight of such testimony, where it goes to establish contradictory propositions. This court ought not to interfere with this great and incontestable right of juries. If the opinions of judges are to countervail the opinions of juries on questions of fact, tho boasted privilege of trial by jury is worth nothing. Indeed, where' the jury appear to have mistaken the evidence, which may be presumed in some cases where the weight of evidence is decidedly against the verdict, the court may grant a new trial: but it ought to be upon the clearest conviction, that the verdict is contrary to the truth of the case.</summary>\n<opinion data-order=\"11\" data-type=\"opinion\" id=\"x999-1\" type=\"majority\">\n<author id=\"b158-7\">Waties, and Trezev ant, Justices,</author>\n<p id=\"Alc\">thought that a new trial ought to be granted, on the ground, that there was a manifest preponderance of evidence against the verdict.</p>\n<p id=\"b158-8\">All the other judges, even Grimke, J., who presided at .the trial, were of a contrary opinion, and that it would be contrary to legal principles to set aside a verdict in a case of this kind, where the, jury had founded it on evidence of facts, complicated and contradictory, which required an investigation into the. characters and credit of witnesses, whose testimony it was necessary to compare and weigh ; operations exclusively appropriated to the business and duty of the jury. 2 Str. 1142. 2 Burr. 665. 1 Wils. 22. 1 Burr. 396, 609.
