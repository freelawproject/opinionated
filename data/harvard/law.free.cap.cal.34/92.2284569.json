The defence relied on by respondent was a plea in bar of certain insolvent proceedings and judgment rendered, in the case of <em>James French </em>v. <em>His Creditors, </em>whereby it was alleged that respondent was discharged from the debt sued on.</summary>\n<summary data-order=\"10\" data-type=\"summary\" id=\"b93-10\">At the trial, the plaintiff introduced the note sued on, and rested.

The appellant excepted, and assigned said rulings as error on appeal.</summary>\n<summary data-order=\"34\" data-type=\"summary\" id=\"b96-6\">The other facts are stated in the opinion of the Court.</summary>\n<attorneys data-order=\"35\" data-type=\"attorneys\" id=\"b96-7\"><em>Hah $ </em>Fellows, for Appellant, argued:</attorneys>\n<p data-order=\"36\" data-type=\"legal\" id=\"b96-8\">That the averments of the petitioner failed to show the required residence of the petitioner within his county for six months next preceding the filing his petition. That this is a jurisdictional fact not shown to exist, hence respondent\u2019s proceedings in insolvency, and the judgment of discharge offered by him in evidence were unauthorized by the Insolvent Act, and void. That the order, directed to the Clerk of the Court, made by the Judge who received respondent\u2019s petition, did not amount to an order to the creditors, as required by section five of the Insolvent Act; hence, the publication by the Clerk of the notice to the creditors was unauthorized by law and failed to secure jurisdiction of the persons of the creditors. That, as the respondent\u2019s petition showed affirmatively he had no property to surrender fertile benefit of his creditors, and the record failed to show any proof, made by the affidavits of witness, that respondent had really sustained the losses stated by him, etc., as required by section thirty-six of the Act, the Judge who received the application of respondent was prohibited from granting the relief expressed.in the judgment offered in evidence; citing, among others, <em>McDonald </em>v. <em>Kutz, </em>31 Cal. 167.</p>\n<attorneys data-order=\"37\" data-type=\"attorneys\" id=\"b96-9\"><em>Jo Hamilton, </em>for Respondent.</attorneys>\n<p data-order=\"38\" data-type=\"legal\" id=\"b96-10\">Appellant assaults the proceeding of the Court granting respondent\u2019s discharge in insolvency, on the ground that his petition shows that he was a citizen of the county for ten years prior to the filing thereof, when it should have been shown that he was a resident of the county for six months prior thereto. I answer his position in two wTays, either of which, I think, is conclusive. First\u2014This petition shows clearly that petitioner is and was not only a citizen, but a <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"97\">*97</page-number>resident of the county for ten years last past. Second\u2014His petition, which was taken, as confessed hy the default, not only so shows, but the Court, in its judgment, expressly decides that he was not only a citizen, but a resident for six months preceding his application. The term \u201c citizen \u201d means not only a resident, hut a resident with citizen\u2019s rights, and is a broader term than the term resident,\u201d and when used, as it is usual in the petition, the former necessa- \u25a0 rily includes the latter term. The citizen must be a resident ; one may he a resident without being a citizen.</p>\n<p data-order=\"39\" data-type=\"legal\" id=\"b97-6\">The counsel for aj&gt;pellant insists upon misunderstanding the effect of section thirty-six of the Insolvent Act, which inhibits him from a similar application within the same year, unless he shall prove his losses actually to have occurred, etc. It is not even pretended that petitioner had ever applied for the benefit of the Act before.</p>\n<p data-order=\"40\" data-type=\"legal\" id=\"b97-7\">It was never intended that the Judge, in making his order, should do a foolish thing. He is required: First\u2014To direct the filing. Second\u2014To fix a day for the meeting of creditors, and order their meeting. Third\u2014To make an order requiring publication. All this he invariably does in one order, as he has done in this case. It is not denied that thereafter the Clerk made the due and lawful publication of the notice of the time and place for meeting of creditors; that the notice is sufficient in form, published for the usual and lawful time, and in the usual and lawful manner.</p>\n<opinion data-order=\"41\" data-type=\"opinion\" id=\"x999-1\" type=\"majority\">\n<author id=\"b97-8\">By the Court, Sawyer, J.:</author>\n<p id=\"b97-9\">Although the language used is not very exact or apt, wre think the petition substantially shows the jurisdictional facts. So, also, the order made by the Judge might in some respects have been better expressed; yet, the effect is, to combine an order for meeting of the creditors with an order to publish the notice. It necessarily imports that the creditors are required to meet on the day they are to be notified <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"98\">*98</page-number>to meet. Jurisdiction having been obtained, we do not think the evidence discloses facts sufficient to vitiate the judgment discharging the insolvent.</p>\n<p id=\"b98-6\">Judgment affirmed.</p>\n</opinion>\n<opinion data-order=\"42\" data-type=\"opinion\" id=\"x999-2\" type=\"rehearing\">\n<author id=\"b98-7\">By the Court, Sawyer, J., on petition for rehearing:</author>\n<p id=\"b98-8\">The construction of section thirty-six of the Act for the relief of Insolvent Debtors is not free from difficulty. We are inclined to think, however, that the clause, \u201c in case he should already have received the benefit of this Act during the next year preceding,\u201d only applies to those parties the appraised value of whose property, exhibited in the schedule, does not amount to more than one third of their debts, and not to those, who have \u201cno property to surrender\u201d to the creditors. In other words, that there are two classes of debtors, whom the Judge \u201c shall not admit to the benefit of this law, unless it be proved to the said Judge, by affidavit . <em>o </em>sworn and subscribed to by two credible and disinterested witnesses that the debtor has really experienced the losses by him stated,\u201d etc., viz: those debtors who have no property to surrender to their creditors; and those who have received the benefit of the Act within a year next preceding, the appraised value of whose property exhibited in the schedule does not amount to more than one third of their debts. If this is not the construction, and the first clause of the section, as well as the second, is qualified by the clause, \u201c in case he should already have received the benefit of this Act during the year next preceding,\u201d the said first clause has no office to perform; for, if a party has no property at all to surrender, the appraised value cannot possibly amount to more than one third of the debts, and the first clause must necessarily be included in the second; and as the second clause covers the whole ground, nothing is left to be provided for, or accomplished by the provision for the first class. It is a rule of construction, that some effect, if possi<page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"99\">*99</page-number>ble, must be given to every word, and, certainly, to every distinct provision of an Act.</p>\n<p id=\"b99-6\">But under the view we take, it is unnecessary to finally determine the question.</p>\n<p id=\"b99-7\">The discharge is attacked collaterally, and the fact required to be proved as to either class, is not jurisdictional. By the filing of the petition, containing a statement of the facts prescribed in sections two and three, and the schedules duly subscribed and verified, and by making the proper order and giving the proper notice, the Court acquires jurisdiction of the subject matter, and of the parties interested. The rest relates to the procedure within the jurisdiction. The Court is then authorized to hear and determine all questions arising in the progress of the case. The question arising under section thirty-six, as to whether the losses have actually occurred or not, involves matter of proof in the course of the exercise of a jurisdiction already acquired over the subject matter, not matter of averment as a basis for acquiring jurisdiction. It is a question that cannot arise until the final hearing. Till then the party cannot be called on for this proof. If the Judge should grant a discharge without proof it would be error, for which the judgment would be reversed on appeal. A Court has no legal authority to render judgment for a money demand in an ordinary suit, where the claim is disputed, without proof; but it has authority to try the issue, and if judgment should be rendered, it would be valid until reversed. The same is true with reference to the point in question. But if the fact be jurisdictional, the judgment itself recites, \u201cthat the requirements of said Act for the relief of insolvent debtors and protection of creditors, and all orders- of the Court herein, have, in every respect, been fully complied with and performed by said petitioner.\u201d One of the requirements of the Act is, that he shall furnish the proof, by affidavit sworn and subscribed to by two creditable and disinterested witnesses, that he really experienced the losses, etc. The Act does not say that their affidavits should be filed, or in any manner made record. Those <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"100\">*100</page-number>recitals are broad enough to cover the proof, and if the fact of proof is necessary to be made to appear, the recitals are record evidence, in a collateral proceeding, that it was done.</p>\n<p id=\"b100-6\">Rehearing denied.</p>\n<p id=\"b100-7\">Sanderson, J., concurring specially:</p>\n<p id=\"b100-8\">I concur in the order, but dissent from the opinion so far as it leaves open the construction of the thirty-sixth section. The construction suggested, but not finally adopted, is, in my judgment, the true construction, beyond a doubt.</p>\n</opinion>\n</casebody>\n",
