In witness whereof, <em>&amp;o.\u201d</em></summary>\n<summary data-order=\"6\" data-type=\"summary\" id=\"b402-5\">The Union Manufacturing Company were the owners of\" the dam at the outlet of Baslian Pond, and of the factory there situated. On the 15th day of April, 1856, the company conveyed their dam and factory, \u201c with all the privileges and appurtenances appertaining thereto, \u201d to N. A. Cowdrey by deed, and on the first day of August, 1857, Cowdrey conveyed the same premises by deed to the defendants.</summary>\n<summary data-order=\"7\" data-type=\"summary\" id=\"b402-6\">On the 29th day of June, 1833, Erastus Smith conveyed his interest in the land to Jeremiah Smith Jr., and on the 19th day of September 1836, Jeremiah Smith 3d conveyed to Jere miah Smith Jr. all his interest in the land, being the three seventeenths conveyed to him by Jeremiah Jr. and Erastus before the lease. Jeremiah Smith Jr. died in 1864, being at his death sole owner of the lands described in the declaration.</summary>\n<summary data-order=\"8\" data-type=\"summary\" id=\"b402-7\">Neither the Union Manufacturing Company nor Cowdrey ever raised the dam and flowed the land described in the declaration, nor did the defendants do so until 1868, when they raised the dam four feet and overflowed the land. The land so overflowed was at the date of the lease, on the 1st day of September, 1832, wood and swamp, covered with trees and bushes, and was enclosed with a large lot of land con tainjng in all about two hundred acres, a part of which was woodland and part pasture land. The only use which had been made of the land since the date of the lease, and before the dam was raised by the defendants, was that the same had been inclosed in said lot which had been used for pasturing cattle.</summary>\n<summary data-order=\"9\" data-type=\"summary\" id=\"b402-8\">The plaintiff requested the court to charge the jury, that under the lease Jeremiah Smith Jr. had conveyed only his <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"395\">*395</page-number>interest in the land, and that his administrator was not estopped from claiming an interest under his subsequently-acquired title from Jeremiah Smith 3rd ; that if the plaintiff was so estopped by reason of the lease being a conveyance of all the lands therein described, and not of the interest of the lessors only, the lease was void because it was a lease by two tenants in common by metes and bounds of a portion of the land held and owned by three tenants in common; that the interest conveyed by the lease had not been conveyed by the deed from the Union Manufacturing Company to Cowdrey, or by the deed from Cowdrey to the defendants; and that if the jury should find that for a period of over thirty years the defendants and those under whom they claimed had not flowed the laud or exercised any of the privileges conveyed by the lease, but that during all that time the plaintiff and those under whom he claimed had the uninterrupted, exclusive and adverse possession of the same, the plaintiff was entitled to recover.</summary>\n<summary data-order=\"10\" data-type=\"summary\" id=\"b403-5\">The court did not so charge the jury, but charged them that the lease professed to convey to the Union Manufacturing. Company the right to raise their dam and thereby overflow the land described in the lease bounding on the pond within the limits named in the lease ; and that the plaintiff was estopped from denying that Jeremiah Smith Jr. and Erastus Smith were the owners of the land thereby conveyed, or that they had a right so to lease the same ; and that the right to raise the dam and flow the land conveyed by the lease did pass to Cowdrey by the deed from the Union Manufacturing Company to him, and by the deed from Cowdrey to the defendants.</summary>\n<summary data-order=\"11\" data-type=\"summary\" id=\"b403-6\">The jury rendered a verdict for the defendants, and the plaintiff moved for a new trial for error in the charge.</summary>\n<attorneys data-order=\"12\" data-type=\"attorneys\" id=\"b403-7\"><em>Chadwick </em>and Warner, in support of the motion.</attorneys>\n<p data-order=\"13\" data-type=\"legal\" id=\"b403-8\">1. The court erred in its construction of the lease. The lease was executed, as appears from its recitals, in view of two facts, viz., the existence of Bashan Pond as created by a natural outlet, and the pond as created by the dam placed on <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"396\">*396</page-number>that outlet by the defendants. By a fair construction the lease cannot be so interpreted as to authorize the flowing of any more land of the lessors than the dam thus erected would flow. The absolute limit is \u201cas high as the water will rise in said pond,\u201d that is, the pond or basin indicated or circumscribed by some then well defined limit or boundary. The lease is fully satisfied by authorizing the defendants to flow all lands flowed by the dam then placed on the outlet. Its object was not to authorize the creation of a new pond, neither did it limit it to the boundaries of the old or natural outlet. It had no reference to the uncertain state of the water in the pond, nor to the condition of the dam, nor to the future caprices of any one. There are no words indicating any intention to make any future extension of the boundaries of the pond. The right to raise the dam was restricted to the limit of the highest point on the dam as it then or before then had existed. The dam might have been then dilapidated, or temporarily carried away, in which case the words \u201cto raise\u201d would mean to keep or maintain the dam to its original status.</p>\n<p data-order=\"14\" data-type=\"legal\" id=\"b404-5\">2. But construing the lease as a <em>grant of power </em>to place an <em>additional structure </em>on the dam as it then existed, this power is vested in the Union Manufacturing Company alone, and not in their assigns or subsequent appointees; and if possibly appendant or appurtenant to the estate in their hands, it ceased to exist when they parted with the estate. <em>Ren </em>v. Bulkley, 1 Doug. R., 293. And if, as the defendants claim, the lease grants the right to raise a new structure on the dam, and to flow as much land as the <em>lessees </em>pleased, the quantity of land to be\u201dflowed being left to their election, such election must have been made within a reasonable time, and the lessees having made an election are confined to that, or having made no election they are now equally estopped. They cannot change the bounds of the pond they have once fixed, or suffered to be fixed by an acquiescence of thirty-six years. It is well settled that when an election is given, and the person to whom it is given . determines, that determination is final. 1 Rolle Abr., 726, (E.) 15 ; Com. Dig., tit. Election, <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"397\">*397</page-number>(C.) 2; <em>The State </em>v. <em>Norwalk &amp; Danbury Turnpike Co., </em>10 Conn., 167 ; <em>Vandenburgh </em>v. <em>Van Bergen, </em>13 Johns., 212.</p>\n<p data-order=\"15\" data-type=\"legal\" id=\"b405-5\">3. The court erred in the construction of the lease as to its effect on the subsequently acquired three-seventeenths interest in the premises. The lease conveys no specific interest or quantity; it covers \u201call the land that we <em>own,\u201d </em>and in legal effect it leased only the lessors\u2019 then present interest, and nothing in its recitals or covenants can be so construed as to estop the lessors or their heirs from asserting any subsequently acquired title. The grant and covenants of warranty applied only to their then present interest and not to any estate of which they might subsequently become possessed. <em>Comstock </em>v. <em>Smith, </em>13 Pick, 116; <em>Blanchard </em>v. <em>Brooks, </em>12 id., 47; <em>Miller </em>v. <em>Ewing, </em>6 Cush., 40. But the lease is without warranty, and there is therefore no estoppel in favor of the assignee of the grantee. 1 Swift\u2019s Dig., 363, 366, 370; 2 Parsons on Contr., 790; <em>Slater </em>v. <em>Raw</em>son; 1 Met., 450. Again, if the lease conveyed anything more than the interest the parties then held, it is void, being given by tenants in common to convey a portion of their common property by metes and bounds. <em>Griswold </em>v. <em>Johnson, </em>5 Conn., 363 ; <em>Starr </em>v. <em>Leavitt, </em>2 id., 243 ; <em>Mitchell </em>v. <em>Hazen, </em>4 id., 511; 1 Swifts\u2019 Dig., 103.</p>\n<p data-order=\"16\" data-type=\"legal\" id=\"b405-6\">4. The court erred in its construction of the deeds through which the defendants derive title. The deeds are specific as to the <em>property, </em>and the quantity of land conveyed, to wit, \u201c about three acres.\u201d This conveys no right to the dam or reservoir above. The right to flow land not flowed is an interest in land, and can pass only by deed. Land never passes as appurtenant to land, for both are equally worthy in the eye of the law. It was a question for the jury whether this right was appurtenant or not. The charge of the court took the question from them. <em>Johnson </em>v. <em>Jordan, </em>2 Met., 234; <em>Carbrey </em>v. <em>Willes, </em>7 Allen, 364; <em>Grant </em>v. <em>Chase, </em>17 Mass., 443; <em>Manning </em>v. <em>Smith, </em>6 Conn., 289; <em>Collyer </em>v. <em>Pierce, </em>7 Gray, 18. Tnirty-five years of non-user was evidence of abandonment by the defendants, and should have <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"398\">*398</page-number>been left to the jury as such. <em>Hoffman </em>v. <em>Savage, </em>15 Mass., 130 ; <em>Campbell </em>v. <em>Winslow, </em>3 East, 294.</p>\n<p data-order=\"17\" data-type=\"legal\" id=\"b406-5\">5. The claim of the plaintiff as to adverse use and possession was correct, and was a question for the jury. <em>Hoffman </em>v. <em>Savage, </em>15 Mass., 130 ; <em>Emerson </em>v. <em>Wiley, </em>10 Pick, 310 ; <em>French </em>v. <em>Braintree Manufacturing Co., </em>23 id., 216; <em>Williams </em>v. <em>Nelson, </em>id., 141.</p>\n<attorneys data-order=\"18\" data-type=\"attorneys\" id=\"b406-6\"><em>Hyde </em>and <em>Culver, </em>contra.</attorneys>\n<opinion data-order=\"19\" data-type=\"opinion\" id=\"x999-1\" type=\"majority\">\n<author id=\"b406-7\">Park J.</author>\n<p id=\"AKx\">On the trial of this case in the court below the plaintiff contended that Jeremiah Smith Jr. leased only his interest in the land described, and that consequently the plaintiff as his administrator was not estopped from claiming the interest in the land which he subsequently acquired from Jeremiah Smith 3rd.</p>\n<p id=\"b406-8\">We think it is clear that the lease purports to convey the entire interest of the land described in it. The language is, \u201call the land we the said Jeremiah, Jeremiah Smith Jr. and Erastus Smith own adjoining the pond commonly called Bash-an Pond in said East Haddam, beginning at the highway at the northwest corner of said pond and running a southerly direction by said pond until it strikes Jabez Swan\u2019s land. \u201d There is nothing said here of any interest in the land less than the entire ownership. The expression, \u201c all the land we own adjoining the pond,\u201d taken in connection with a description of the land by bounds, must mean that the land described was owned by them; which could not have been said if they .were mere tenants in common of the land with another person.</p>\n<p id=\"b406-9\">The lease contains a covenant of ownership, and the plaintiff must therefore be estopped to deny that his intestate, with the others named, owned the entire interest in the land at the time the lease was given. <em>Stowe </em>v. <em>Wyse, 7 </em>Conn., 214; <em>Hoyt </em>v. <em>Dimon, </em>5 Day, 483 ; <em>Coe </em>v. <em>Talcott, </em>5 Day, 88.</p>\n<p id=\"b406-10\">We see no error in the charge of the court, that the lease conveyed the right to raise the dam and thereby flow the <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"399\">*399</page-number>water upon the premises described in the lease. The expression \u201c to raise the dam \u201d implies that there is a dam in existence that may be raised, and applies to the whole dam, to one part of it as well as to another, so that the suggestion of the plaintiff, that the dam at the time, might have been out of repair, or the old one destroyed by a freshet, and that the expression therefore may have been intended to apply to a repairing in the one case, or a rebuilding in the other, does not meet the requirements of the language used. Indeed, if this construction could apply, it would simply show that the expression is ambiguous, and in that case extrinsic evidence would be. required to show in what sense it was tised by the parties. But no such claim was made on the trial. The plaintiff insists that it must have been used in this sense, because the right granted is limited by the phrase .\u201c as high as the water will rise in said pond. \u201d And that the term \u201c said pond \u201d means the pond made by the dam then exist ing, when capable of flowing back the water to its highest point. But this construction renders the lease inoperative, unless the existing dam set back the water upon the premises of the plaintiff\u2019s intestate higher than the lessees had a right to do, which is not even pretended.</p>\n<p id=\"b407-5\">The lease purports to convey a right, and it must be construed to have that effect if it can be done without doing violence to the language used. We think it is clear that the term <em>\u201c </em>said pond \u201d was used to designate the place where the flowage might be made, and that the power conferred should be limited only by the natural barriers to the water around the pond and the premises described. A pond increased or diminished by raising or lowering the dam is in common parlance called the same pond.</p>\n<p id=\"b407-6\">We think it is equally clear that the exercise of the power granted is not limited to the Union Manufacturing Company. There could have been no object to be accomplished by such limitation. If the lessors desired to limit the power granted it would have been an easy matter to have done so, but \u201c full leave and liberty \u201d is given the lessors to raise the dam for the benefit .of the factory, or for any other purpose for which <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"400\">*400</page-number>they or their assigns shall see fit to use the same. It is quite too nice and technical to say that the-power to raise the dam is conferred on the lessees only, but the use of it when raised may be enjoyed by their assigns ; thus making a distinction between the right to raise the dam, and the right to flow the premises by the dam when raised. But this distinction has no foundation, as clearly appears by the habendum of the lease, which is, \u201c to have and to hold to the said Union Manufacturing Company and their assigns, for said term, to use, and occupy, &amp;c. \u201d To have and to hold what ? Manifestly the right conferred ; the right to raise the dam for the purposes specified in the lease.</p>\n<p id=\"b408-5\">We think also that there is no foundation for the claim of the plaintiff that the lease is void because it is a lease by metes and bounds of a part of a tract of land owned by the lessors in common with another party who never executed the lease. The lease does not attempt to make a partition of the land held in common. The lessors profess to own the entire interest in the tract described. The case is simply one where a grantor conveys a greater interest than he owned at the time. It is the ordinary case where a party is estopped to claim that he owned a less interest than the deed purports to convey.</p>\n<p id=\"b408-6\">Equally without foundation is the claim that the right to raise the dam was lost by the omission of the Union Manufacturing Company and their assigns to raise the dam for a period of thirty-six years. No doubt in certain cases where a right is conferred to be exercised at the option of a party, the right becomes exhausted by one exercise of the right, but this case does not come within the principle, for here the right was never exercised at all until the defendants did the acts for which this suit is brought. Omission to raise the dam cannot be construed into an exercise of the right to raise it. It might be evidence tending to show an abandonment of the right, but not the exercise of it. The right was theirs to be enjoyed at any time.</p>\n<p id=\"b408-7\">We think too that the plaintiff is wrong in his claim that this right did not pass from the Union Manufacturing <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"401\">*401</page-number>Company to Cowdrey, and from Cowdrey to the defendants, under the grant in the deeds of \u201cprivileges and appurtenances.\u201d The lease was made for the benefit of the factory privilege. The right is an incorporeal hereditament, and could be enjoyed only in connection with the factory privilege, and is therefore strictly appurtenant to it. This court held, in the case of <em>Frink </em>v. Branch, 16 Conn., 260, that under the description in a deed conveying \u201c the one equal undivided half of a satinet factory,\u201d together with the appurtenances, that not only the factory building was conveyed, but the land on which it stood, and the water privilege appurtenant thereto. This authority is in accordance with the ruling of the court below.</p>\n<p id=\"b409-5\">The plaintiff is also wrong in his claim in relation to adverse possession. The fact that the premises in question were enclosed in a lot containing about two hundred acres of land, and that the lot was exclusively used by the plaintiff\u2019s intestate for the pasturage of cattle during a period of more than fifteen years, without any objection and under a claim of right, furnishes no evidence of adverse user. All this is in perfect harmony with the right conveyed. That right was the mere right of flowage, and whatever herbage there may have been on the premises belonged to the lessors as much after the lease was given as before. Suppose a-grant is made of a right of way, and the grantee omits to use the way for a period of fifteen years, and the grantor pastures the land over which the right of way passes. It has been held by numerous authorities that might be cited, that the grantee does not thereby lose his right, for there is no adverse user. Adverse user in this case would consist of such acts on the part of the owners of the soil as would prevent the lessees and their assigns from flowing the land.</p>\n<p id=\"b409-6\">A new trial is not advised.</p>\n<p id=\"b409-7\">In this opinion the other judges concurred.</p>\n</opinion>\n</casebody>\n",
