We conclude that there is no legal requirement that a defendant file a proposed judgment. The trial court correctly denied plaintiff Jacquelyn Fries\u2019s motion to tax or strike costs, and we affirm the order and judgment awarding costs. However, we reverse two discovery orders issued after the case was dismissed because they were void due to the trial court\u2019s lack of jurisdiction.</p>\n<p id=\"b160-3\"><page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"184\">*184</page-number>BACKGROUND</p>\n<p id=\"b160-4\">Fries, a minor, filed this action against Rite Aid Corporation and Richard Green through her guardian ad litem. The complaint alleged that Green, a Rite Aid security guard, detained and sexually molested Fries under the pretext that he was investigating a shoplifting incident.</p>\n<p id=\"b160-5\">On September 4, 2007, Fries filed a request for dismissal of the entire action without prejudice. She filed and served notice of entry of dismissal on September 10, 2007. On September 10 and September 12, 2007, Rite Aid and Green filed their respective memoranda of costs. Fries responded with a motion to strike or tax costs, in which she argued the memoranda of costs were procedurally defective because defendants failed to file proposed judgments or orders of dismissal when they filed the memoranda. Alternatively, she asserted that certain costs were not allowable, were unreasonable in amount, or were not reasonably necessary to the conduct of the litigation.</p>\n<p id=\"b160-6\">Several weeks before the hearing on the motion to strike or tax, Green sent the court a proposed judgment of dismissal. His cover letter explained: \u201cAs you know, the plaintiff has made much of some requirement that the defendants submit a proposed judgment with their cost bill. Although we do not concede this claim, out of an excess of caution, we did submit a proposed judgment. Thereafter, we received endorsed copies of all that we filed except the proposed judgment, which was returned with a note from the Clerk saying that the Clerk will not file this until after costs have been determined and that we need to insert the amount awarded by the Court before submitting the judgment.\u201d</p>\n<p id=\"b160-7\">The court rejected Fries\u2019s contention that defendants\u2019 failure to submit a proposed judgment with their costs memoranda barred recovery. The court noted that defendants complied with rule 3.1700 of the California Rules of Court<footnotemark>1</footnotemark> and observed that a practice guide Fries relied upon to argue the defendants were required to submit a proposed judgment \u201cis interesting but. . . does not address the plain language of [rule] 3.1700 . . . .\u201d The court taxed $2,638.96 of Rite Aid\u2019s claimed costs but otherwise approved both parties\u2019 costs bills.</p>\n<p id=\"b161-4\"><page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"185\">*185</page-number>Green and Rite Aid submitted a proposed judgment that declared the action was dismissed without prejudice and awarded costs of $11,741.87 and $4,372.55 to Rite Aid and Green, respectively. This appeal timely followed.</p>\n<p id=\"b161-5\">DISCUSSION</p>\n<p id=\"b161-6\">I. <em>The Necessity for a Proposed Judgment Prior to an Award of Costs</em></p>\n<p id=\"b161-7\">Fries contends the trial court was required to deny all claimed costs because defendants did not file a proposed judgment together with their costs memoranda. We disagree.</p>\n<p id=\"b161-8\">Rule 3.1700 governs the procedure for claiming costs. In relevant part, it provides: \u201cA prevailing party who claims costs must serve and file a memorandum of costs within 15 days after the date of mailing of the notice of entry of judgment or dismissal by the clerk under Code of Civil Procedure section 664.5 or the date of service of written notice of entry of judgment or dismissal, or within 180 days after entry of judgment, whichever is first.\u201d (Rule 3.1700(a)(1).)<footnotemark>2</footnotemark> Defendants complied with rule 3.1700 when they filed memoranda of costs within 15 days after the date the notice of entry of dismissal was served. The question is whether, as Fries maintains, defendants were also required to file a proposed judgment along with their memoranda of costs, even though rule 3.1700 does not provide that they must do so. Neither the cases nor the practice guide Fries cites to support her position are persuasive.</p>\n<p id=\"b161-9\">In <em>Boonyarit </em>v. <em>Payless Shoesource, Inc. </em>(2006) 145 Cal.App.4th 1188 [52 Cal.Rptr.3d 241], the plaintiff filed an amended complaint that omitted six defendants named in a previous complaint, including Payless. She then attempted to voluntarily dismiss those six defendants without prejudice, but the court clerk rejected her request for dismissal because she had not correctly completed the form. The error was never corrected and no dismissal was entered. Payless nonetheless filed a costs memorandum and was awarded costs. On appeal, the plaintiff contended that Payless should not have been awarded costs because there was no order or judgment of dismissal. <em>(Id. </em>at p. 1192.)</p>\n<p id=\"b162-3\"><page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"186\">*186</page-number>The Court of Appeal reversed. Rule 870, the predecessor of rule 3.1700, \u201ccontemplates the entry of a dismissal or judgment as a predicate to a costs award.\u201d <em>(Boonyarit v. Payless Shoesource, Inc., supra, </em>145 Cal.App.4th at p. 1192.) In <em>Boonyarit </em>the necessary predicate was absent because the clerk rejected the dismissal form. \u201cA dismissal is entered when it is entered in the clerk\u2019s register; it is thereafter effective for all purposes.\u201d <em>(Ibid.) </em>The court also rejected the argument that the amended complaint operated \u201cin substance\u201d as a dismissal of Payless for purposes of costs because \u201cit cannot invoke the statutory right to costs until the dismissal has been perfected <em>through entry of an order or judgment of dismissal.\u201d (Id. </em>at p. 1193, italics added.) But in this case, unlike in <em>Boonyarit, </em>a dismissal <em>was </em>entered. <em>Boonyarit, </em>therefore, is inapposite.</p>\n<p id=\"b162-4\">Nor does <em>Sanabria v. Embrey </em>(2001) 92 Cal.App.4th 422 [111 Cal.Rptr.2d 837] support Fries\u2019s argument. There, Sanabria sued the Embreys. Scherer intervened in the action, and Sanabria cross-complained against Scherer. Sanabria later voluntarily dismissed the Embreys without prejudice and, on December 1, 1999, served and filed a notice of entry of dismissal as to them. Scherer\u2019s complaint-in-intervention and Sanabria\u2019s cross-complaint were subsequently resolved and notice of entry of judgment in favor of Scherer was served on May 3, 2000. <em>(Id. </em>at p. 424.) The Embreys filed a memorandum of costs 16 days later. <em>(Ibid.)</em></p>\n<p id=\"b162-5\">The Court of Appeal held the Embreys\u2019 costs memorandum was untimely because it was not filed within 15 days from service of the notice of entry of dismissal. <em>(Sanabria </em>v. <em>Embrey, supra, </em>92 Cal.App.4th at pp. 425-426.) Although the cross-actions between Scherer and Sanabria remained pending, the dismissal of the Embreys was effective when entered. Service of notice of entry of the dismissal therefore triggered their time within which to file their memorandum of costs, and that time expired long before the litigation between Scherer and Sanabria ended in the judgment noticed in May 2000. <em>(Id. </em>at p. 426.)</p>\n<p id=\"b162-6\">No such lapse of time between dismissal and the costs memoranda occurred here, and Fries does not contend otherwise. Instead, Fries relies on <em>Sanabria </em>and <em>Boonyarit </em>because both cases, in dictum, refer to a passage in Weil and Brown\u2019s Civil Procedure Practice Guide. It says: \u201cOrdinarily, a judgment or order must be entered upon which a costs award may be based. [Citations.] [][] But the mechanics for obtaining a judgment or order awarding costs after a voluntary dismissal are not clear: [][] CRC 3.1700(a)(1) states: \u2018A prevailing party who claims costs shall serve and file a memorandum of costs . . . (within specified time) after service of written notice of entry of <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"187\">*187</page-number><em>judgment or </em>dismissalBut this provision seems to refer to <em>involuntary </em>rather than voluntary dismissals because it refers to CCP \u00a7664.5 (which has no application to voluntary dismissals). [See <em>Boonyarit v. Payless Shoesource, Inc., supra, </em>145 CA4th at 1192, 52 CR3d at 243 (citing text)][.] [|] Therefore, apparently, defendant\u2019s memorandum of costs must be filed <em>together with </em>a proposed <em>judgment </em>of dismissal. <em>[Sanabria v. Embrey </em>(2001) 92 CA4th 422, 425, 111 CR2d 837, 839 (citing text).]\u201d (Weil &amp; Brown, Cal. Practice Guide: Civil Procedure Before Trial (The Rutter Group 2008) H 11:38 to 11:38.2, pp. 11-22 to 11-23.)</p>\n<p id=\"b163-5\">Fries\u2019s reliance on this commentary is not persuasive. We find the rationale for the oddly tentative suggestion that a proposed judgment is \u201capparently\u201d required to be unconvincing. The practice guide reasons that rule 3.1700(a)(1) \u201cseems to refer to <em>involuntary </em>rather than voluntary dismissals <em>because it refers to CCP \u00a7664.5.\u201d </em>(Weil &amp; Brown, Cal. Practice Guide: Civil Procedure Before Trial, <em>supra, </em>|| 11:38 to 11:38.2, pp. 11-22 to 11-23, first italics in original, second italics added.) But the reference to Code of Civil Procedure section 664.5<footnotemark>3</footnotemark> does not create the ambiguity the authors of Weil and Brown suggest it does. Rule 3.1700(a)(1) is phrased in the disjunctive: \u201cA prevailing party who claims costs must serve and file a memorandum of costs within 15 days after [1] the date of mailing of the notice of entry of judgment or dismissal by the clerk under Code of Civil Procedure section 664.5 <em>or </em>[2] <em>the date of service of written notice of entry of judgment or dismissal, or </em>[3] within 180 days after entry of judgment, whichever is first.\u201d (Bracketed numbers and italics added.) The reference to Code of Civil Procedure section 664.5 (which concerns involuntary dismissals) modifies only the <em>first </em>of three alternative deadlines. Weil and Brown\u2019s observation that the <em>second </em>deadline, running from service of written notice of entry of judgment or dismissal, does not apply to <em>voluntary </em>dismissals therefore does not follow. Nor is the distinction Weil and Brown seeks to apply supported by the cited cases, <em>Boonyarit </em>or <em>Sanabria. </em>Neither holds that a voluntarily dismissed defendant must file a proposed judgment of dismissal together with the memorandum of costs.</p>\n<p id=\"b163-6\">Fries also argues that the requirement for a judgment follows from a 1958 case, <em>MacLeod </em>v. <em>Tribune Publishing Co. </em>(1958) 157 Cal.App.2d 665 [321 P.2d 881]. We disagree. The Legislature has expressly directed that prejudgment costs \u201cshall be claimed and contested in accordance with rules adopted by the Judicial Council.\u201d (\u00a7 1034, subd. (a).) In 1987, almost 30 years after <em>MacLeod, </em>the Judicial Council adopted the predecessor of rule <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"188\">*188</page-number>3.1700 that governed the procedures for claiming prejudgment costs.  Nothing in rule 3.1700 or its predecessor suggests a defendant must file a proposed judgment along with a memorandum of costs in order to recover its costs after a voluntary dismissal.</p>\n<p id=\"b164-4\"><em>MacLeod </em>has lost currency since 1958 for a second reason as well. The adoption of former rule 870 undermined its ratio decidendi. The <em>MacLeod </em>court concluded that an entry in the clerk\u2019s register that showed a request for dismissal was filed was not, without more, a \u201cjudgment\u201d sufficient to start the time running for the period to file a memorandum of costs under former section 1033.<footnotemark>4</footnotemark> Instead, the <em>MacLeod </em>court reasoned, the \u201cjudgment\u201d that starts running the time for claiming costs must be the order of dismissal, because, at that time, \u201c[t]o hold otherwise would be to place the burden upon a person involved in any litigation of constantly checking the clerk\u2019s records to see whether or not a dismissal has been entered without notice to him.\u201d <em>(MacLeod </em>v. <em>Tribune Publishing Co., supra, </em>157 Cal.App.2d at pp. 667-668.) The adoption of rule 870, now 3.1700, obviated the problem identified in <em>MacLeod </em>by predicating its 15-day period within which to file a costs bill upon notice to the defendant of entry of dismissal.</p>\n<p id=\"b164-5\">In any event, if <em>MacLeod </em>could be viewed to require a dismissed defendant to obtain a <em>court order of dismissal </em>before filing a costs bill\u2014a view we do not espouse\u2014even then, it would not support Fries\u2019s rather different claim that a costs bill must be stricken unless it is filed together with a proposed judgment. The trial court was correct to conclude that a dismissed defendant seeking costs pursuant to rule 3.1700 is not required to file a proposed judgment along with its memorandum of costs.</p>\n<p id=\"b164-6\">II., III.<footnotemark>*</footnotemark></p>\n<p id=\"b165-4\"><page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"189\">*189</page-number>DISPOSITION</p>\n<p id=\"b165-5\">The order and judgment awarding costs are affirmed in their entirety.
