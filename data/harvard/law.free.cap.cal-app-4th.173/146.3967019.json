The court declared the bail forfeited and issued a bench warrant. The clerk mailed notice of forfeiture to Fairmont on July 14, 2006. The notice stated: \u201cYour contractual obligation to pay this bond will become absolute on the 186 day following the date of the mailing of this notice unless the court shall order the forfeiture set aside and the bond reinstated. You may within 185 days from the date of the mailing of this notice surrender the defendant to the court or to custody or appear in court to make a motion to set aside the forfeiture of bail/bond.\u201d<footnotemark>3</footnotemark></p>\n<p id=\"b126-4\">On motion of Fairmont, the court extended the period within which to surrender the defendant or set aside the forfeiture to August 1, 2007.<footnotemark>4</footnotemark> On August 7, 2007, the court entered summary judgment on the bond.</p>\n<p id=\"b126-5\">On August 29, 2007, Fairmont moved to set aside the summary judgment, discharge the forfeiture and exonerate the bail. Fairmont presented evidence that on August 21, 2006, approximately one month after Davis failed to appear and the court declared bail forfeited, Davis was arrested by the Culver City Police Department for shoplifting. The booking officer learned of the bench warrant. She called the Inglewood Police Department and was advised, according to her report, \u201cto release [defendant] on the above warrant due to medical concerns.\u201d</p>\n<p id=\"b126-6\">In opposition to Fairmont\u2019s motion, respondent County of Los Angeles presented a declaration from the Culver City booking officer, Heidi Hattrup, who stated: \u201cDavis was transported to Culver City Police Department and booked on [charges] stemming from the [shoplifting] incident . ... HQ At Culver City Police Department it was discovered that [Davis] had an outstanding Inglewood warrant .... Sergeant Salcedo of Inglewood Police Department was contacted and advised us not to arrest Davis on the above warrant due to medical concerns. The outstanding warrant was not discovered until after Davis was placed in custody on the new burglary charge; therefore I never placed her under arrest for the outstanding warrant.\u201d</p>\n<p id=\"b126-7\">The court denied Fairmont\u2019s motion. This appeal followed.</p>\n<p id=\"b127-4\"><page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"151\">*151</page-number>DISCUSSION</p>\n<p id=\"b127-5\">A. <em>Standard of Review</em></p>\n<p id=\"b127-6\">An order denying a motion to vacate or set aside a forfeiture and exonerate the bail is an appealable order. <em>(People v.

However, where, as here, we review the trial court\u2019s interpretation of a statute on uncontested facts, the issue concerns a pure question of law and is subject to de novo review. <em>(People v. American Bankers Ins. Co. </em>(1992) 4 Cal.App.4th 348, 351 [5 Cal.Rptr.2d 620]; see <em>People ex rel.

Wilcox </em>(1960) 53 Cal.2d 651, 656-657 [2 Cal.Rptr. 754, 349 P.2d 522].) \u201cA bail bond is in the nature of a contract between the government and the surety, in which the surety acts as a guarantor of the defendant\u2019s appearance under risk of forfeiture of the bond. [Citation.] \u2018In general the state and surety agree that if the state will release the defendant from custody, the surety will undertake that the defendant will appear personally and at a specified time and place .... If the defendant fails to appear at the proper time and place, the surety becomes the absolute debtor of the state for the amount of the bond.\u2019 [Citation.]\u201d <em>(People </em>v. <em>Amwest Surety Ins.

(a)(4).) The statute goes on to specify a number of situations in which the forfeiture must be vacated and the bond exonerated: if the defendant appears voluntarily or in custody in court within 180 days of the date of mailing notice of forfeiture <em>(id., </em>subd. (c)(1)); if \u201cwithin the county where the case is located, the defendant is surrendered to custody by the bail or is arrested in the underlying case within the 180-day period, and is subsequently released from custody prior to an appearance in court\u201d <em>(id., </em>subd.

American Bankers Ins. Co., supra, 4 </em>Cal.App.4th at p. 354.) \u201cThe burden is upon the bonding company seeking to set aside the forfeiture to establish by competent evidence that its case falls within the four comers of these statutory requirements.\u201d <em>(Ibid.; </em>accord, <em>County of Los Angeles v. Fairmont Specialty Group </em>(2008) 164 Cal.App.4th 1018, 1027 [79 Cal.Rptr.3d 421].)</p>\n<p id=\"b128-5\">The specific provision at issue here is section 1305, subdivision (c)(2), which provides that the court shall direct the order of forfeiture to be vacated and the bond exonerated \u201c[i]f, within the county where the case is located, the defendant is surrendered to custody by the bail or is arrested in the underlying case within the 180-day period, and is subsequently released from custody prior to an appearance in court. . . .\u201d Subdivision (h) of section 1305 explains that the term \u201c \u2018arrest\u2019 \u201d must be interpreted to include \u201ca hold placed on the defendant in the underlying case while he or she is in custody on other charges.\u201d</p>\n<p id=\"b128-6\">The key terms for interpretation are \u201carrested in the underlying case\u201d in section 1305, subdivision (c)(2) and \u201chold placed on the defendant in the underlying case\u201d in subdivision (h). In construing these terms, \u201c \u2018we must. . . <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"153\">*153</page-number>consider \u201c \u2018the object to be achieved and the evil to be prevented by the legislation.\u2019 \u201d [Citation.]\u2019 \u201d <em>(In re Marquez </em>(2003) 30 Cal.4th 14, 20 [131 Cal.Rptr.2d 911, 65 P.3d 403].) Words used will be given the meaning that \u201c \u2018reason and justice require . . . , rather than a literal meaning which would lead to an unjust and absurd consequence.\u2019 \u201d <em>(People v. American Bankers Ins. Co. </em>(1991) 227 Cal.App.3d 1289, 1295 [278 Cal.Rptr. 314], overruled on another ground in <em>People </em>v. <em>National Automobile &amp; Casualty Ins. Co. </em>(2000) 82 Cal.App.4th 120 [97 Cal.Rptr.2d 858].) Courts do not \u201c \u2018blindly follow the literal meaning of every word if to do so would frustrate the legislative purpose.\u2019 \u201d <em>(People v. Ranger Ins. Co., supra, </em>at p. 1384, italics omitted.) The provisions of section 1305 in particular must be accorded \u201ca reasonable, commonsense construction in line with [their] apparent purpose, in order to advance wise legislative policy and avoid absurdity.\u201d <em>(People </em>v. <em>Ranger Ins. Co. </em>(1992) 9 Cal.App.4th 1302, 1307 [12 Cal.Rptr.2d 343].)</p>\n<p id=\"b129-5\">Respondent County of Los Angeles maintains that the determination whether Davis was arrested or placed on hold in the underlying case should turn on what the booking officer subjectively believed. We believe a more commonsense interpretation is required. Officer Hattrup arrested and booked Davis for shoplifting on August 21, 2006. While Davis was in custody, the officer learned of the outstanding bench warrant and contacted the Inglewood Police Department. Although Davis was never formally arrested for the failure to appear, Officer Hattrup\u2019s actions leave no doubt that Davis would not have been released until the Culver City Police Department ascertained the status of the outstanding warrant. Thus, from the time Officer Hattrup learned of the warrant to the time she was notified to ignore it, Davis was subject to a \u201chold ... in the underlying case\u201d within the meaning of section 1305, subdivision (h), and thus \u201carrested in the underlying case\u201d under subdivision (c)(2). (Cf. <em>In re Marquez, supra, </em>30 Cal.4th at p. 20 [prisoner\u2019s custody may be attributed to two different charges pending in two different jurisdictions].)</p>\n<p id=\"b129-6\">Our construction does not render the phrase \u201cin the underlying case\u201d surplusage. Had Officer . Hattrup remained ignorant of the outstanding warrant, Davis\u2019s detention could not be attributed to \u201cthe underlying case.\u201d However, she was aware of the warrant, and there is no suggestion she intended to do anything but honor it until advised otherwise by Sergeant Salcedo. In contrast, where an arresting agency remains ignorant of an outstanding warrant, it cannot be said that the defendant is subject to a hold \u201cin the underlying case.\u201d</p>\n<p id=\"b129-7\">As both sides concede, there is no authority directly on point. We find support for our conclusion in <em>People v. Far West Ins. Co. </em>(2001) 93 Cal.App.4th 791 [113 Cal.Rptr.2d 448] <em>(Far West). </em>There, the defendant was <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"154\">*154</page-number>located by the surety\u2019s agent in Georgia and taken into custody by Georgia authorities, who contacted the police department in Oakland where he was wanted for failing to appear at a court hearing in connection with a pending armed robbery charge. The Oakland Police Department, without notifying the district attorney\u2019s office, instructed the Georgia sheriff to \u201crelease [the] hold\u201d on the defendant. <em>(Id. </em>at p. 793.) The respondent county contended that under the facts presented, \u201cthe prosecuting agency\u201d had made no election against extradition as required for exoneration of the bond under section 1305, subdivisions (f) and (g). The court, relying on the principle that the statutes governing bail \u201c \u2018must be strictly construed in favor of the surety to avoid the harsh results of a forfeiture\u2019 \u201d and given a \u201c \u2018reasonable, commonsense construction in line with [their] apparent purpose, in order to advance wise legislative policy and avoid absurdity,\u2019 \u201d concluded that the failure to alert the district attorney\u2019s office was not fatal to the surety\u2019s motion for relief from forfeiture. <em>(Far West, supra, </em>93 Cal.App.4th at p. 795.) The court did not attempt \u201cto formulate a broad legal rule,\u201d but held that \u201cunder the circumstances [presented]\u2014a California fugitive admitted to bail, apprehended and held in custody in another state, is released as a result of errors committed solely by officials of the demanding county government and the surety has done all that is required of it under the terms of the bond\u2014bail is exonerated.\u201d <em>(Id. </em>at p. 798.) To hold otherwise, \u201cwould discourage sureties from undertaking to underwrite bail bonds, contrary to the evident policy of the Legislature as expressed in the statutory scheme.\u201d <em>(Ibid.)</em></p>\n<p id=\"b130-4\">Similar principles guide us here. Bench warrants are orders from the court \u201ccommand[ing]\u201d law enforcement officials to \u201cforthwith . . . arrest\u201d the named defendant and \u201cbring him or her before [the] Court.\u201d (\u00a7 981.) Sureties who enter into bond agreements have a right to presume that the authorities will carry out their legal responsibilities and take custody of absconding defendants when they are located and arrested by fellow officers in other jurisdictions. In <em>Far West, </em>the defendant\u2019s arrest was the result of the efforts of the surety. Davis\u2019s arrest came about as the result of fortuitous circumstances. In both cases, however, the arresting officers learned of the outstanding warrants and law enforcement officials within the appropriate jurisdictions were immediately informed that the defendants were in custody and available for transfer. To accept that authorities may willfully ignore a lawful warrant and still collect from the sureties involved is at odds with section 1305, which in general requires exoneration when the defendant\u2019s absence from court is entirely the fault of the authorities in the jurisdiction where the case is located. The object of the bail and forfeiture provisions is to ensure the attendance in court of the defendant, not to bring \u201c \u2018revenue to the state\u2019 \u201d or \u201c \u2018punishQ . . . the surety.\u2019 \u201d <em>(Far West, supra, </em>93 Cal.App.4th at pp. 794\u2014795, quoting <em>People v. Wilcox, supra, </em>53 Cal.2d at pp. 656-657.) An interpretation of section 1305, subdivisions (c)(2) and (h) permitting a bail <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"155\">*155</page-number>forfeiture to stand under the circumstances presented here would create a financial disincentive to enforcing warrants and bringing criminal defendants to justice, and would undermine the Legislature\u2019s carefully constructed statutory scheme.</p>\n<p id=\"b131-5\">DISPOSITION</p>\n<p id=\"b131-6\">The judgment and order denying Fairmont\u2019s motion to set aside summary judgment, discharge the forfeiture and exonerate the bail are reversed.
