Provided that the registrar of voters in said parishes shall not appoint a deputy registrar, as herein authorized and provided, until the police jury of said parish has agreed to pay its portion of the salary of said deputy registrar. One-half of the compensation to be paid each registrar of voters and dep\u2022uty registrar, as above set out, shall be \u2022paid by the State of Louisiana and one-\u2022half by the parish of the registrar, * * * .\u201d</blockquote>\n<p id=\"b216-13\">The police jury of the Parish of Calcasieu has not agreed to pay one-half the compensation of a deputy registrar of voters.</p>\n<p id=\"b216-14\">The trial judge\u2019s ruling is based upon \u2022 the apparently unambiguous provision of the act that the registrar shall not appoint a deputy until the police jury has agreed to pay its portion \u25a0 of the salary of such deputy.</p>\n<p id=\"b216-15\">In this court relator complains that the district court has ignored another provision of the same section of the act, and in the last paragraph thereof, reading: \u201cand it is hereby made the duty of the several police juries throughout the state * * * to appropriate in their annual budgets, as one of the expenses of the parish, the compensation of said registrars and deputy registrars * * * \u201d. This last provision must logically be construed in connection with the prior one, and such appropriation for compensation of deputy registrars is conditional upon the previous agreement on the part of the police jury, to pay such compensation.</p>\n<p id=\"b216-17\">Relator also suggests in argument that the clause, requiring the police jury to agree to pay half of the compensation of deputy registrars, was intended to take care only of that period between the date the act was adopted, and the going into effect of the budget to be adopted by the police jury for the following calendar year. If the law-maker so intended that clause, it should have so declared. We do not believe that the court would be justified in attaching to the statute a stipulation, which it does not contain and which is not necessary for its construction or enforcement.</p>\n<p id=\"b216-18\">We believe the judgment appealed from is correct and should be affirmed, and</p>\n<p id=\"b216-19\">It is so ordered.</p>\n</opinion>\n</casebody>\n",
