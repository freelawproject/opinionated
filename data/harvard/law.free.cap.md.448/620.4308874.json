Taylor, </em>306 Md. 290, 293, 508 A.2d 964 (1986), we decided that an award of joint custody was a permissible exercise of a trial court\u2019s general equity powers. Notably, we also explained in <em>Taylor </em>that the most important factor for a court to consider before awarding joint custody is the capacity of the parents to communicate and to reach shared decisions affecting a child\u2019s welfare. <em>Id. </em>at 304, 508 A.2d 964. Today we address whether a court abused its discretion in awarding joint custody in spite of evidence that, to put it mildly, the parents could not communicate and reach shared decisions for their two children. As a related matter \u2014 one not addressed explicitly in <em>Taylor </em>\u2014 we consider the propriety of the use of provisions in joint custody awards that grant one parent the authority to make a decision about a matter affecting the child when the parents cannot agree. We call these tie-breaking provisions.</p>\n<p id=\"b614-8\">FACTS AND LEGAL PROCEEDINGS</p>\n<p id=\"b614-9\">Adam Santo (\u201cFather\u201d) and Grace Santo (\u201cMother\u201d) married in 2000 and divorced in 2011. They have two sons, who were eight and five years old, respectively, at the time of the divorce. Following a 2011 order of joint legal custody, the Santos renewed the battle over their children by filing more motions. Custody was modified in 2013 to, among other things, facilitate joint custody through the use of a parenting <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"625\">*625</page-number>coordinator. Several other motions are indicative of their ongoing struggle.</p>\n<p id=\"b615-4\">The precise motion that led to the question we review today was Father\u2019s 2014 motion to modify custody. Therein Father sought sole custody of his sons so that, he maintains, \u201cthe children will not remain in a combat zone forever.\u201d Following a three-day hearing, the Circuit Court for Montgomery County denied Father\u2019s motion and preserved a joint custody arrangement. We shall discuss the court\u2019s findings and the details of that arrangement <em>infra, </em>particularly the tie-breaking provisions awarded to each parent.</p>\n<p id=\"b615-5\">Father noted a timely appeal, and the Court of Special Appeals affirmed the Circuit Court\u2019s decision in an unreported opinion.</p>\n<p id=\"b615-6\">Father filed a Petition for Writ of Certiorari to this Court, which we granted<footnotemark>1</footnotemark>:</p>\n<blockquote id=\"b615-7\">Whether the trial court abused its discretion in ordering joint custody in light of <em>Taylor v. Taylor, </em>306 Md. 290 [508 A.2d 964] (1986)?</blockquote>\n<p id=\"b615-10\">Because we answer no, we shall affirm the judgment of the Court of Special Appeals.</p>\n<p id=\"b615-11\">STANDARD OF REVIEW</p>\n<p id=\"b615-12\">We review a trial court\u2019s custody determination for abuse of discretion. <em>Petrini v. Petrini, </em>336 Md. 453, 470, 648 A.2d 1016 (1994). This standard of review accounts for the trial court\u2019s unique \u201copportunity to observe the demeanor and the credibility of the parties and the witnesses.\u201d <em>Id.</em></p>\n<p id=\"b615-13\">Though a deferential standard, abuse of discretion may arise when \u201c \u2018no reasonable person would take the view <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"626\">*626</page-number>adopted by the [trial] court\u2019 or when the court acts \u2018without reference to any guiding rules or principles.\u2019\u201d <em>In re Adoption/Guardianship No. 3598, </em>347 Md. 295, 312, 701 A.2d 110 (1997) (internal citations omitted). Such an abuse may also occur when the court\u2019s ruling is \u201c \u2018clearly against the logic and effect of facts and inferences before the court\u2019 or when the ruling is \u2018violative of fact and logic.\u2019 \u201d <em>Id. </em>(internal citations omitted). Put simply, we will not reverse the trial court unless its decision is \u201c \u201cwell removed from any center mark imagined by the reviewing court.\u2019 \u201d <em>Id. </em>at 313, 701 A.2d 110 (citation omitted).</p>\n<p id=\"b616-5\">The light that guides the trial court in its determination, and in our review, is \u201cthe best interest of the child standard,\u201d which \u201cis always determinative in child custody disputes.\u201d <em>Ross v. Hoffman, </em>280 Md. 172, 178, 372 A.2d 582 (1977).</p>\n<p id=\"b616-6\">DISCUSSION</p>\n<p id=\"b616-7\">Father avers that the Circuit Court erred because it did not follow the <em>\u201csine qua non </em>for an award of joint legal custody\u201d as established in <em>Taylor v. Taylor, </em>306 Md. 290, 508 A.2d 964 (1986). In his view, an award of joint legal custody <em>requires </em>that the parents effectively communicate or will be capable of making parenting decisions together in the future. The record and the Circuit Court\u2019s findings, Father contends, reflect a tale of \u201cparties [who] have been and remain at war with one another.\u201d He thus maintains that it was an abuse of discretion for the Circuit Court to have granted an award of joint custody to parents whom it knew could not communicate effectively.</p>\n<p id=\"b616-8\">Mother disagrees, and reads <em>Taylor </em>as merely setting forth \u201cnonexclusive factors\u201d for a court to apply in a custody dispute. Mother maintains that <em>Taylor </em>requires the court to consider \u201call factors and options available\u201d to determine \u201cwhat is in the best interest of the children.\u201d In Mother\u2019s view, the Circuit Court did just that \u2014 applied the relevant factors, <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"627\">*627</page-number>considered options, and made a decision for the children\u2019s best interests.</p>\n<p id=\"b617-4\">\n<em>Taylor v. Taylor</em>\n</p>\n<p id=\"b617-5\">We begin our analysis of <em>Taylor </em>by reviewing the Court\u2019s explication of legal and physical custody, and joint legal and joint physical custody \u2014 terms important to our discussion. \u201cLegal custody carries with it the right and obligation to make long range decisions\u201d that significantly affect a child\u2019s life, such as education or religious training. <em>Taylor, </em>306 Md. at 296, 508 A.2d 964. \u201cPhysical custody, on the other hand, means the right and obligation to provide a home for the child and to make\u201d daily decisions as necessary while the child is under that parent\u2019s care and control. <em>Id.</em></p>\n<p id=\"b617-6\"> In joint legal custody, the <em>Taylor </em>Court explained, \u201cboth parents have an equal voice in making [long range] decisions, and neither parent\u2019s rights are superior to the other.\u201d <em>Id. </em>In joint physical custody, the parents will share or divide custody of the child, but not necessarily \u201con a 50/50 basis.\u201d <em>Id. </em>at 297, 508 A.2d 964. With respect to a circuit court\u2019s authority in child custody cases, \u201cthe power of the court is very broad so that it may accomplish the paramount purpose of securing the welfare and promoting the best interest of the child.\u201d <em>Id. </em>at 301-02, 508 A.2d 964. To assist trial courts \u201cin determining whether joint custody is appropriate,\u201d the <em>Taylor </em>Court offered up \u201cthe major factors\u201d to consider. <em>Id. </em>at 303, 508 A.2d 964.<footnotemark>2</footnotemark></p>\n<p id=\"b618-4\"><page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"628\">*628</page-number>To be sure, the <em>Taylor </em>Court saw \u201cthe most important factor\u201d in deciding whether to award joint legal custody as the \u201ccapacity of the parents to communicate and to reach shared decisions affecting the child\u2019s welfare.\u201d<footnotemark>3</footnotemark> <em>Id. </em>at 304, 508 A.2d 964. As it explained, \u201cthere is nothing to be gained and much to be lost by conditioning the making of decisions affecting the child\u2019s welfare upon the mutual agreement of\u2019 parents who are \u201cseverely embittered\u201d and whose \u201crelationship [is] marked by dispute, acrimony, and a failure of rational communication.\u201d <em>Id. </em>at 305, 508 A.2d 964.</p>\n<p id=\"b618-5\">In other words, <em>Taylor </em>stands for the proposition that effective parental communication is weighty in a joint legal custody situation because, under such circumstances, parents are charged with making important decisions together that affect a child\u2019s future. If parents cannot make those decisions together because, for example, they are unable to put aside their bitterness for one another, then the child\u2019s future could be compromised.</p>\n<p id=\"b618-6\">To further guide trial courts in evaluating parental communication, the <em>Taylor </em>Court explained that \u201cthe best evidence\u201d a court should look for is \u201cpast conduct or [a] \u2018track record\u2019 of the parties.\u201d <em>Id. </em>at 307, 508 A.2d 964. \u201cRarely, if ever,\u201d is a joint legal custody award permissible, the Court stated, absent such conduct, \u201cand then only when it is possible to make a finding of a strong potential for such conduct in the future.\u201d <em>Id. </em>at 304, 508 A.2d 964. In the latter circumstance, the Court said, \u201cthe trial judge must articulate fully the reasons that support that conclusion.\u201d <em>Id. </em>at 307, 508 A.2d 964.</p>\n<p id=\"b619-3\"><page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"629\">*629</page-number>In asking us to hold that joint legal custody \u201cshould be awarded <em>only if </em>a custody court\u201d concludes that parents \u201care or likely will be capable of communicating and reaching joint (i.e., shared) parenting decisions,\u201d Father would have us impose an inflexible template on equity courts making child custody decisions. (Emphasis added.) But, as the <em>Taylor </em>Court recognized, \u201c[f]ormula[s] or computer solutions in child custody matters are impossible because of the unique character of each case, and the subjective nature of the evaluations and decisions that must be made.\u201d <em>Id. </em>at 303, 508 A.2d 964. To elevate effective parental communication so that it becomes a prerequisite to a joint custody award would undermine the trial court\u2019s complex and holistic task. On this point, <em>Taylor </em>is and remains vitally instructive:</p>\n<blockquote id=\"b619-4\">The resolution of a custody dispute continues to be one of the most difficult and demanding tasks of a trial judge. It requires thorough consideration of multiple and varied circumstances, full knowledge of the available options, including the positive and negative aspects of various custodial arrangements, and a careful recitation of the facts and conclusions that support the solution ultimately selected.</blockquote>\n<p id=\"AtL\"><em>Id. </em>at 311, 508 A.2d 964.</p>\n<p id=\"b619-5\">Courts in other jurisdictions that, like Maryland, have no applicable statutory factors, concur that no one factor serves as a prerequisite to a custody award. <em>See, e.g., Clark v. Reiss, </em>38 Ark. App. 150, 831 S.W.2d 622, 624 (1992) (\u201cThe prime concern and controlling factor is the best interest of the child, and the court in its sound discretion will look into the peculiar circumstances of each case and act as the welfare of the child appears to require.\u201d); <em>Hamby v. Hamby, </em>102 So.3d 334, 337 (Miss.Ct.App.2012) (\u201cThe <em>Albright [v. Albright, </em>437 So.2d 1003 (Miss.1983) ] factors are a guide for chancellors in weighing the facts to determine the child\u2019s best interest.\u201d) (citation and internal quotation marks omitted); <em>Eschbach v. Eschbach, </em>56 N.Y.2d 167, 451 N.Y.S.2d 658, 436 N.E.2d 1260, 1263 (1982) (\u201c \u2018[N]o agreement of the parties can bind the court to a disposition other than that which a weighing of all the factors involved shows to be in the child\u2019s best interests.\u2019 \u201d) (citation <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"630\">*630</page-number>omitted); <em>Hall v. Hall, </em>188 N.C.App. 527, 655 S.E.2d 901, 905 (2008) (\u201c \u2018These findings may concern physical, mental, or financial fitness or any other factors brought out by the evidence and relevant to the issue of the welfare of the child.\u2019\u201d) (citation omitted); <em>Waters v. Magee, </em>877 A.2d 658, 664-65 (R.I.2005) (\u201cNo one factor is determinative; rather, the trial justice should consider a combination of and an interaction among all the relevant factors.\u201d) (citation and internal quotation marks omitted); <em>Scott v. Scott, </em>354 S.C. 118, 579 S.E.2d 620, 623 (2003) (\u201c[I]n making custody decisions \u2018the totality of the circumstances peculiar to each case constitutes the only scale upon which the ultimate decision can be weighed.\u2019 \u201d) (citation omitted); <em>Hathaway v. Bergheim, </em>648 N.W.2d 349, 352 (S.D.2002) (\u201cThese factors serve as guidelines and the trial court need not address all of them.\u201d); <em>but see Foshee v. Foshee, </em>247 P.3d 1162, 1168-69 (Okla.2010) (\u201c[JJoint custody is not proper where the parents are unable to cooperate.\u201d).<footnotemark>4</footnotemark></p>\n<p id=\"b620-5\">Based on <em>Taylor, </em>and our review of other jurisdictions, we decline to hold as a matter of law that a court errs if it awards joint custody to parents who fail to communicate effectively with one another. As the <em>Taylor </em>Court cautioned, <em>\u201cnone </em>\u201d of the major factors in a custody case \u201chas talismanic qualities, and [] no single list of criteria will satisfy the demands of every case.\u201d <em>Id. </em>at 303, 508 A.2d 964 (emphasis added).</p>\n<p id=\"b620-6\">Consistent with <em>Taylor, </em>we emphasize that a trial court should carefully set out the facts and conclusions that support the solution it ultimately reaches. To use words from Father\u2019s brief, no \u201crobotic recitation that a custody award proposed by a custody court is in the \u2018child\u2019s best interest\u2019 serve[s] as a replacement for the serious consideration\u201d of the <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"631\">*631</page-number>facts and circumstances of each case. This is especially so in those cases where a court considers awarding joint legal custody to parents who cannot communicate effectively. In such cases, a court must articulate well the justifications for awarding joint custody.</p>\n<p id=\"b621-5\">\n<em>Tie-Breaking Provisions in Joint Legal Custody Awards</em>\n</p>\n<p id=\"b621-6\">Neither party disputes that this is a case in which a trial court awarded joint custody to parents who do not communicate well. As the Circuit Court explained, \u201c[tjhese parents have essentially been at war with each other since 2010.\u201d Anticipating that these parents would not succeed in making all decisions on behalf of their children, the Circuit Court included tie-breaking provisions in the award so one parent would have the last word if they reached an impasse.</p>\n<p id=\"b621-7\">Father argues that such provisions are inconsistent with <em>Taylor </em>and Md. Code (1984, 2012 Repl. Vol.), \u00a7 5-203(d) of the Family Law Article (\u201cFL\u201d). FL \u00a7 5-203(d) provides that \u201ca court may award custody of a minor child to either parent or joint custody to both parents.\u201d FL \u00a7 5-203(d). Reading this section of the statute literally, Father avers that Maryland courts have two options \u2014 award sole <em>or </em>joint custody \u2014 but no option to create \u201chybrids of the two.\u201d He also fears that the use of tie-breaking provisions \u201chas exponentially expanded\u201d into \u201cspheres of major importance.\u201d Finally, Father argues that, as a practical matter, tie-breaking provisions may promote conflict or simply be ineffective.<footnotemark>5</footnotemark></p>\n<p id=\"b622-3\"><page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"632\">*632</page-number>In <em>Shenk v. Shenk, </em>159 Md.App. 548, 556, 860 A.2d 408 (2004) the Court of Special Appeals held that the trial court \u201cacted within its legal authority\u201d in awarding joint legal custody and designating one parent as the \u201ctie[-]breaker\u201d if the parents disagreed about a matter affecting their children.<footnotemark>6</footnotemark> The intermediate appellate court rejected the argument that <em>Taylor </em>precluded such an award by noting that <em>Taylor </em>\u201cexpressly acknowledged the existence of \u2018multiple forms\u2019 of joint custody\u201d and rejected formulaic approaches to child custody matters as inconsistent with the \u201c \u2018unique character of each case.\u2019 \u201d <em>Id. </em>at 560, 860 A.2d 408 (quoting 306 Md. at 303, 508 A.2d 964). In the intermediate appellate court\u2019s view, joint legal custody with tie-breaking authority in one parent was still joint custody. <em>Id. </em>(\u201cThe accommodation fashioned by the trial court does not transform the arrangement into something other than joint custody.\u201d). Finally, the <em>Shenk </em>court reasoned that the trial court\u2019s ability to fashion such an award was \u201cin keeping with the \u2018broad and inherent power of an equity court to deal fully and completely with matters of child custody.\u2019 \u201d <em>Id. </em>(quoting <em>Taylor, </em>306 Md. at 301, 508 A.2d 964).</p>\n<p id=\"b622-4\">Here we decide whether a custody award \u2014 comparable to that in <em>Shenk </em>\u2014 comports with the <em>Taylor </em>Court\u2019s formulation of joint legal custody. The <em>Taylor </em>Court defined joint legal custody as \u201cboth parents hav[ing] an equal voice in making [long range] decisions [of major significance concerning the child\u2019s life and welfare], and neither parent\u2019s rights [being] superior to the other.\u201d 306 Md. at 296, 508 A.2d 964. In a joint legal custody arrangement with tie-breaking provisions, the parents are ordered to try to decide together matters affecting their children. When, and only when the parties are at an impasse after deliberating in good faith does the tie-breaking provision permit one parent to make the final <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"633\">*633</page-number>call. Because this arrangement requires a genuine effort by both parties to communicate, it ensures each has a voice in the decision-making process.</p>\n<p id=\"b623-5\">To be sure, the <em>Taylor </em>Court\u2019s definition of joint legal custody places parents\u2019 decision-making rights on an equal footing; indeed, it characterizes their voices as being equal. <em>See id. </em>A delegation of final authority over a sphere of decisions to one parent has the real consequence of tilting power to the one granted such authority.</p>\n<p id=\"b623-6\">But such an award is still consonant with the core concept of joint custody because the parents must try to work together to decide issues affecting their children. <em>See Ronny M. v. Nanette H., </em>303 P.3d 392, 405 (Alaska 2013) (\u201cThe court\u2019s approach [awarding joint legal custody with final decision-making authority to mother] is reasonably intended to encourage both parents to communicate and attempt to make decisions about their children.... \u201d). We require that the tiebreaker parent cannot make the final call until <em>after </em>weighing in good faith the ideas the other parent has expressed regarding their children. <em>Cf. State on behalf of Maddox S. v. Matthew E., </em>23 Neb.App. 500, 873 N.W.2d 208, 219 (2016) (\u201cWe also point out that the court maintained the goal of \u2018mutual agreement\u2019 between the parties....; only now, the final say as to certain major issues rests with the designated parent if they cannot otherwise agree.\u201d). Such an award has the salutary effect of empowering both parents to participate in significant matters affecting their children.<footnotemark>7</footnotemark> <em>See Shea v. Metcalf, </em>167 Vt. 494, 712 A.2d 887, 891 (1998) (\u201cBy avoiding an \u2018all or nothing approach,\u2019 the order keeps both parents in the role of active parenting, takes full advantage of their individual strengths, and avoids awarding either parent responsibility <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"634\">*634</page-number>for which he or she is not suited.\u201d). Because this arrangement requires both parties to attempt to make decisions together, it is a form of joint custody. <em>See Taylor, </em>306 Md. at 303, 508 A.2d 964 (\u201cThe availability of joint custody, in any of its multiple forms, is but another option available to the trial judge.\u201d).<footnotemark>8</footnotemark></p>\n<p id=\"b624-5\">The requirement of good faith communication between the parents helps to ensure the parent with tie-breaking authority does not abuse the privilege of being a final decision-maker. And a court has the means to sanction a breach of good faith. In <em>Downing v. Perry, </em>123 A.3d 474, 483-85 (D.C.2015), the District of Columbia Court of Appeals affirmed a trial court order of joint legal custody that transferred final decision-making authority from the father to a neutral third party because the father had abused this privilege. Among other things, the <em>Downing </em>court emphasized the trial court\u2019s finding that the father had \u201crigid[ly] exercise[d]\u201d tie-breaking authority granted him under a prior agreement based on a \u201cpatterned negative response [to the mother\u2019s] suggestions, rather than making decisions in the child\u2019s best interest.\u201d <em>Id. </em>at 484. Even though both parents had \u201cequal rights,\u201d the <em>Downing </em>court explained that the father \u201cwas using his tie-breaking authority as a form of <em>de facto </em>sole legal custody.\u201d <em>Id. </em>at 484 n. 11.</p>\n<p id=\"b624-6\"><em>Downing </em>underscores that tie-breaking authority does not eliminate the voice of the parent without that authority. Rather, such measure pragmatically reflects the need for <em>some </em><page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"635\">*635</page-number>decision to be made <em>for the child </em>when parents themselves cannot agree. It is the child, after all, whom the court must consider foremost in fashioning custody awards. <em>See Taylor, </em>306 Md. at 301-02, 508 A.2d 964 (\u201cAs has historically been the case, the power of the court is very broad so that it may accomplish the paramount purpose of securing the welfare and promoting the best interest of the child.\u201d).</p>\n<p id=\"b625-5\">Other jurisdictions have affirmed awards of joint custody with tie-breaking provisions precisely because of the parties\u2019 inability to make decisions for their children. <em>Bonner v. Bonner, </em>170 So.3d 697, 703 (Ala.Civ.App.2015) (\u201cThe trial court\u2019s judgment [awarding joint custody], however, resolved those types of conflicts by designating the husband as the primary decision maker regarding the child\u2019s education.\u201d); <em>Schneider v.

The fallacy in Father\u2019s argument is that it presumes that the court\u2019s authority to award custody is derived strictly from statute. This is incorrect. Rather, it is a long-established rule of construction in Maryland that \u201cstatutes are to be construed in reference to the principles of the common law. For it is not to be presumed that the [Legislature intended to make any innovation upon the common law, further than the case absolutely required.\u201d <em>Hooper v. City of Balt., </em>12 Md. 464, 475 (1859); <em>see The Arundel Corp. v. Marie, </em>383 Md. 489, 502 n. 5, 860 A.2d 886 (2004); <em>see also </em>1A Norman J. Singer <em>&amp; </em>J.D. Shambie Singer, Statutes and Statutory Construction \u00a7 26:5, at 600 (7th ed. 2009) (\u201cStatutes declaratory of the common law are coextensive with the common law and no change in meaning is presumed to have been intended by their enactment.\u201d). Consistent with this rule of construction, we said in <em>Taylor </em>that \u201c[o]ur inquiry [ ] is not whether the [the General Assembly] has <em>granted </em>a power, but whether it has attempted to <em>limit </em>a power that exists as a part of the inherent authority of the court.\u201d 306 Md. at 298, <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"638\">*638</page-number>508 A.2d 964 (emphasis added). The Court undertook this inquiry because the issue in <em>Taylor </em>\u2014 the authority to grant joint custody \u2014 \u201cis an integral part of the broad and inherent authority of a court exercising its equitable powers to determine child custody.\u201d <em>Id. </em>In addressing again the court\u2019s authority to grant joint custody, we undertake the same inquiry.</p>\n<p id=\"b628-5\">FL \u00a7 5-203(d) states that \u201c[i]f the parents live apart, a court may award custody of a minor child to either parent or joint custody to both parents.\u201d The precursor to FL \u00a7 5-203 stated in pertinent part: \u201cWhere the parents live apart, the court may award the guardianship of the child to either of them____\u201d Maryland Code (1957, 1983 Repl. Vol.), \u00a7 1 of Article 72A. The <em>Taylor </em>Court analyzed the precursor and concluded that nothing therein limited \u201cthe broad and inherent power of an equity court to deal fully and completely with matters of child custody,\u201d and, pertinent in that case, to award joint custody. 306 Md. at 301, 508 A.2d 964.

The General Assembly\u2019s decision to codify case law in FL \u00a7 5-203 established no limitation upon a trial court\u2019s equity powers to fashion custody awards. <em>See also Taylor, </em>306 Md. at 300-01 n. 9, 508 A.2d 964 (\u201cWe consider this amendment [in 1986 to FL \u00a7 5-203] to be declarative of existing common law.\u201d).

Sigurdsson, </em>408 Md. 167, 175, 968 A.2d 1075 (2009) (\u201cIn either situation, the decision whether to modify is governed by the material change in circumstances and best interest standards.\u201d) (citation and internal quotation marks omitted).</p>\n<p id=\"b629-7\">Father argues that the Circuit Court abused its discretion because it awarded joint custody to two parents whom the court found to be utterly incapable of communicating.<footnotemark>14</footnotemark> In Father\u2019s view, the court\u2019s reasoning that the parties should have joint legal custody \u201cso that both of them have access to-information about their children\u201d is faulty because the parents are statutorily entitled to have access to records pertaining to their children. He further maintains that the Circuit Court \u201cpaid mere lip service to the <em>Taylor </em>[flactors,\u201d particularly <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"640\">*640</page-number>whether the parents could effectively communicate. The custody order strikes Father as simply ineffective in protecting his children from his toxic relationship with Mother.</p>\n<p id=\"b630-4\">Mother, on the other hand, reasons that the court was \u201cwithin its discretion\u201d because it found that the children needed both parents to be involved in their lives. She maintains that the court\u2019s finding of ineffective parental communication does not undermine the joint custody award because the Circuit Court proceeded to analyze the relevant factors under <em>Taylor </em>and articulated its reasons for awarding joint custody with tie-breaking provisions. She contends that Father\u2019s attempts to previously exclude her through his final decision-making authority are strong evidence supporting the court\u2019s decision to grant joint legal custody with tie-breaking provisions.</p>\n<p id=\"b630-5\">Once the Circuit Court explained that there was a material change in circumstances in the children\u2019s lives,<footnotemark>15</footnotemark> the court proceeded to engage in the following analysis of the <em>Taylor </em>factors, <em>see </em>806 Md. at 304-11, 508 A.2d 964:</p>\n<blockquote id=\"b630-6\">\u2022 Parental fitness: \u201cThis is a very complicated issue[ ]. Each of the parents loves and is capable of providing for the children. However, their unvarnished hatred of each other leads them to do and say things that are contrary to the welfare of the children.\u201d</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b630-7\">\u2022 The sincerity of the parents\u2019 requests: \u201cThe requests] are simple, each one [wants] sole legal custody and primary physical custody and to minimize the other\u2019s role in the lives of the children.

Mother has filed for bankruptcy. Father is soliciting funds for legal fees on public bulletin boards. Father\u2019s wife is employed outside of the home, so he has help in meeting his household expenses.\u201d</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b631-7\">\u2022 Demands of parental employment: \u201cThere was no testimony that there [w]as any interference with the parents[\u2019] ability to parent related to their jobs.\u201d</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b631-8\">\u2022 Relationships of parents with their children: \u201cThere was no testimony about [M]other\u2019s relationship with the boys, other than her own, which was that it was good.

Neither parent presented well in court.\u201d</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b632-4\">\u2022 Agreements between the parties: \u201cNone, other than the children\u2019s attendance at [their school] and that it has been a good thing for them.\u201d</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b632-5\">\u2022 Parents\u2019 ability to maintain relationships between the children and others who may affect the children\u2019s best interests: \u201cNeither parent has demonstrated skill in this category.\u201d</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b632-6\">\u2022 Parents\u2019 ability to maintain a stable, appropriate home: \u201cEach of the parties has ability to do so, [and] [F]ather\u2019s resources are greater.\u201d</blockquote>\n<p id=\"b632-7\">A review of the record reveals a thoughtful, painstaking consideration of the relevant issues affecting the parties\u2019 custody dispute. The court was aware of the challenge it faced in fashioning an appropriate award, noting that \u201c[t]his is a very difficult case.\u201d Indeed, before announcing its decision during its oral opinion, the court expressed that it had \u201cconsidered a variety of options, none of which is especially satisfactory.\u201d At the end of the three-day hearing, for example, the Circuit Court had observed: \u201ceach parent seems to have the view that if they respectively, one or the other, has sole legal custody the problems will stop and they will have control. The reality is that will never happen.\u201d</p>\n<p id=\"b632-8\">The court also acknowledged that the existing joint custody arrangement had proved problematic. But the court expressed that the parents had good relationships with their children, loved and could provide for them. Thus, the court reasoned that \u201cthe children will do best if they see each parent regularly\u201d and that \u201cthe children need to see each of you and have a close relationship with both [of] you.\u201d The court\u2019s discussion reveals that, in maintaining joint legal custody, it was focused on what was in the children\u2019s best interests.</p>\n<p id=\"b632-9\">The court candidly and repeatedly acknowledged that the parents were unable to communicate or cooperate well, but was concerned about the children\u2019s need to stay involved with both parents. It determined that \u201cthe only way both of these <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"643\">*643</page-number>parents can stay involved with their children\u2019s lives is with [a] strict set of rules about who does what and when.\u201d Such rules included provisions granting tie-breaking authority on education, religion, and medical issues to Father, and selection of therapist to Mother. As we have explained <em>supra, </em>courts have employed tie-breaking provisions in joint custody awards on account of poor parental communication. <em>See, e.g., Bonner, </em>170 So.3d at 703 (\u201cThe trial court\u2019s judgment [awarding joint custody], however, resolved those types of conflicts by designating the husband as the primary decision maker regarding the child\u2019s education.\u201d); <em>Rembert, </em>674 S.E.2d at 894 (\u201cThus, it is unlikely that they will agree on these issues; the need to designate a final decision-maker is apparent; and the trial court did not abuse its discretion in selecting the primary custodial parent as that decision-maker [in its joint custody award].\u201d); <em>Glidewell, </em>869 N.W.2d at 808 (affirming joint custody with division of decision-making duties where \u201cthe anger that [the parents] ha[d] towards one another cloud[ed] their judgment and prevented] them from making important collective decisions on behalf of their children\u201d).</p>\n<p id=\"b633-4\">Moreover, testimony at the hearing, including the excerpts below, provided a basis for the Circuit Court to award one parent decision-making authority over the other as it did:</p>\n<blockquote id=\"b633-5\">\u2022 Education (Father): The children\u2019s school principal testified she would reconsider allowing them to attend \u201cif [Father] was in charge, then it would definitely be. So, if he had sole custody it would be dealing with one person who had the children\u2019s best interests and could work cooperatively with the school.\u201d</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b633-6\">\u2022 Religion (Father): A member of the temple where the children attend religious school testified that she nominated Father to be a board member: \u201c[Father] was an involved parent at the religious school. And I thought he would be <em>[sic </em>] a good perspective to the Board of Education.\u201d</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b633-7\">\u2022 Medical issues (Father): One of the children\u2019s psychiatrist, who administered his medications, testified on cross-<page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"644\">*644</page-number>examination about email communication with the parents: \u201cSo, with the email that was sent, the impression that I got unfortunately, was that she [Mother] no longer wanted to communicate with me. And so I have to use the resources that I have to make the best decisions that I can for a child.\u201d</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b634-5\">\u2022 Selection of therapist (Mother): Mother testified: \u201cI am a psychiatric therapist. I am in private practice, and have a number of ongoing consulting cases.\u201d</blockquote>\n<p id=\"b634-6\">The Circuit Court\u2019s order also included solutions to the relevant problems the court identified at the hearing:</p>\n<blockquote id=\"b634-7\">\u2022 Medication: \u201cMother will be provided the medication necessary for each child while the child or children are with her. Father shall assure that [M]other has the name and dosage for each such medication.\u201d<footnotemark>17</footnotemark></blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b634-8\">\u2022 Therapy: \u201cThe children will remain in regular therapy. The parents will see that the children go on a regular, consistent basis and that the therapy takes precedence over other activities.\u201d <footnotemark>18</footnotemark></blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b634-9\">\u2022 Extracurricular activities: \u201cEach parent will decide the activities in which the children will participate when the children are [with] that parent and will pay for those activities individually.\u201d <footnotemark>19</footnotemark></blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b634-10\">\u2022 Threats: \u201cMother will not threaten school, religious, or medical personnel.\u201d<footnotemark>20</footnotemark></blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b635-3\"><page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"645\">*645</page-number>\u2022 Derogatory remarks: \u201cFather will not speak or act in a derogatory manner toward [Mjother or denigrate her in public.\u201d<footnotemark>21</footnotemark></blockquote>\n<p id=\"b635-4\">Father pins the basis for the court\u2019s decision to award joint custody on its statement that \u201cthe reason for [the parties to continue to have joint legal custody] is so that both of them have access to information about the children.\u201d In Father\u2019s view, this reason is insufficient because Maryland law already entitles parents to records about their children. That is, FL \u00a7 9-104 states that \u201caccess to medical, dental and educational records concerning the child may not be denied to a parent because the parent does not have physical custody of the child.\u201d FL \u00a7 9-104.</p>\n<p id=\"b635-5\">The Circuit Court\u2019s statement is better understood, in context, as reflecting its concern that Father was \u201cdictatorial,\u201d and that his actions deprived Mother of information about her children, information that goes beyond the scope of FL \u00a7 9-104, which simply entitles parents to <em>records. See </em>FL \u00a7 9-104. Mother gave the following testimony about Father\u2019s actions:</p>\n<blockquote id=\"b635-6\">\u2022 \u201cHowever, over the course, especially of the last year, [Father] has treated me and third parties as if he had full custody and actively excluded me from decision making and information pertaining to the lives of the children.\u201d</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b635-7\">\u2022 \u201cWithout any discussion with me, he and Dr. Wu pulled medication and decided that [our son\u2019s] [medication] needs to be provided by the school.\u201d</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b635-8\">\u2022 \u201c[Father] will do things like send me e-mails saying that he took [our son] to an emergency medical appointment, that [our son] was diagnosed with swimmer\u2019s ear. Will not tell me what the medication is, which ear it is, when I\u2019m supposed to give the medication. I have to ask every specific question in detail in order to get any information.\u201d</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b636-4\"><page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"646\">*646</page-number>\u2022 \u201c[Father] informed me of [our son\u2019s sprained wrist], after it happened, but failed to give me pertinent details.\u201d</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b636-5\">\u2022 Mother explains she cannot get information at an urgent care center because the center did not know she was a custodial parent.</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b636-6\">\u2022 \u201c[Father] regularly has the children in locations that I don\u2019t know about being taken care of by his parents, or by [his new wife\u2019s] parents, and I don\u2019t know where they are or when they\u2019re going.\u201d</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b636-7\">\u2022 \u201c[T]here was this series of 7 or 8 instances during that time period where I was not given information where the children were injured on school property and I was not called.\u201d</blockquote>\n<p id=\"b636-8\">Ultimately, Father\u2019s argument about FL \u00a7 9-104 overlooks the evidence of Mother\u2019s exclusion and the court\u2019s view of Father\u2019s \u201cdictatorial\u201d conduct. The court evidently believed that it was in the children\u2019s best interests to \u201chave a close relationship\u201d with Mother \u2014 as well as with Father. For Mother to have an effective relationship, though, she would need access to information about her children; granting Father sole legal custody would undermine that objective.</p>\n<p id=\"b636-9\">The Circuit Court\u2019s determination \u2014 predicated on its thorough review of the <em>Taylor </em>factors, deliberation over custody award options, sober appreciation of the difficulties before it, and use of strict rules including tie-breaking provisions to account for the parties\u2019 inability to communicate \u2014 was rational and guided by established principles of Maryland law. No abuse of discretion occurred in this case.</p>\n<p id=\"b636-10\">CONCLUSION</p>\n<p id=\"b636-11\">We hold today that a court of equity ruling on a custody dispute may, under appropriate circumstances and with careful consideration articulated on the record, grant joint legal custody to parents who cannot effectively communicate together regarding matters pertaining to their children. In doing so, the court has the legal authority to include tie-breaking provisions in the joint legal custody award. In this case, the <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"647\">*647</page-number>Circuit Court\u2019s order of joint legal custody with tie-breaking provisions was not an abuse of discretion.</p>\n<p id=\"b637-5\">JUDGMENT OF THE COURT OF SPECIAL APPEALS AFFIRMED. COSTS TO BE PAID BY PETITIONER.</p>\n<judges id=\"b637-6\">WATTS and BATTAGLIA, JJ., concur.</judges>\n<footnote label=\"1\">\n<p id=\"b615-14\">. We have rephrased Father's question, which in his Petition asks: \u201cWhether the so-called <em>'Taylor </em>factors,' in particular the requirement that parents effectively communicate to make shared parenting decisions in the children\u2019s best interests, continue to constitute binding legal parameters, circumscribing the discretion of a custody court faced with a 'joint' versus 'sole' legal custody decision.\u201d</p>\n</footnote>\n<footnote label=\"2\">\n<p id=\"b617-7\">. Although the majority of jurisdictions have statutory factors for courts to consider in custody cases, Maryland does not. <em>See </em>Linda D. Elrod &amp; Robert G. Spector, <em>A Review of the Year in Family Law: Numbers of Disputes Increase, </em>45 Fam. L.Q. 443, 494-96 (2012) (denoting which jurisdictions have statutory factors and which do not).</p>\n<p id=\"b617-8\">The only statutory directive relates to child abuse or neglect, which is not pertinent here. Under Md. Code (1984, 2012 Repl. Vol.), \u00a7 9-101 of the Family Law Article (\"FL\u201d), a trial court must determine if there are \"reasonable grounds to believe\u201d that a child has been abused or neglected by a party seeking custody. If there are reasonable grounds, the court must make a finding that there is no further likelihood of abuse or neglect before awarding unsupervised custody to that person.</p>\n</footnote>\n<footnote label=\"3\">\n<p id=\"b618-7\">. The other factors the Court expressly discussed in <em>Taylor v. Taylor, </em>306 Md. 290, 307-11, 508 A.2d 964 (1986) were the willingness of the parents to share custody, the fitness of the parents, the relationship established between the child and each parent, the preference of the child, the potential disruption of the child's social and school life, the geographic proximity of parental homes, the demands of parental employment, the age and number of children, the sincerity of the parents\u2019 request, the financial status of the parents, the impact on state or federal assistance, and the benefit to the parents.</p>\n</footnote>\n<footnote label=\"4\">\n<p id=\"b620-7\">. In jurisdictions with statutory factors, the statutes do not contain restrictive language but instead expansive language such as \"including\" or \"any other factor.\" <em>See, e.g., </em>Ariz.Rev.Stat.

What Mother overlooks is that this issue was <em>\"decided by the trial court.\u201d </em>Maryland Rule 8-131(a) (emphasis added.) That is, the Circuit Court granted joint legal custody and said \"there will be specific tie[-]breaker authority as follows,\u201d which the court then discussed.</p>\n<p id=\"b621-9\">Additionally, we have previously determined that an issue that a party fails to present to the trial court is reviewable when the issue \"transcends\u201d that case, \"may affect hundreds of cases,\u201d \"implicates important\u201d rights, and where \"guidance is needed.\u201d <em>See Chaney v. State, </em>397 Md. 460, 468, 918 A.2d 506 (2007) (reviewing a challenge to a restitution order that the appellant never presented in his complaint to the trial court). We agree with Father that when tie-breaking provisions <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"632\">*632</page-number>reach \u201cspheres of major importance\u201d in children's lives, as in this case, the issue meets the <em>Chaney </em>standards.</p>\n</footnote>\n<footnote label=\"6\">\n<p id=\"b622-6\">. According to our research, <em>Shenk v. Shenk, </em>159 Md.App. 548, 860 A.2d 408 (2004) is the first reported Maryland appellate case with a decision on the propriety of tie-breaking provisions.</p>\n</footnote>\n<footnote label=\"7\">\n<p id=\"b623-7\">. As the Court in <em>Taylor, </em>306 Md. at 311, 508 A.2d 964 aptly noted:</p>\n<blockquote id=\"A5M\">Although the primary focus is properly upon the best interest of the child, it is also appropriate to consider the salutary effect that joint custody may have on the parents, not only because their feelings and interests are worthy of consideration, but also because their improved self-image as parents is likely to redound to the ultimate benefit of the child.</blockquote>\n</footnote>\n<footnote label=\"8\">\n<p id=\"b624-7\">. The <em>Taylor </em>Court did not explore the possibility or permissibility of tie-breaking provisions in a joint custody arrangement. But we do not infer the Court's silence on the issue to constitute a rejection thereof. As an initial matter, joint custody was still a fairly new concept around the time of <em>Taylor. See, e.g., </em>Child Custody Practice and Procedure \u00a7 5:1, at 582 (Linda D. Elrod ed. 2015) (\"Although there were instances of 'divided' custody, \u2018joint\u2019 custody did not emerge as a legislated custody option until the early 1970s.\u201d). Moreover, our research suggests that the use of tie-breaking provisions in joint custody awards is quite a recent innovation in child custody cases. Only one jurisdiction to approve of such an award did so before <em>Taylor </em>and many published cases have come down in just the past few years.</p>\n</footnote>\n<footnote label=\"9\">\n<p id=\"b625-7\">. <em>See also Baker-Grenier v. Grenier, </em>147 Conn.App. 516, 83 A.3d 698, 700-01 (2014) (affirming joint custody award with final decision-making authority and noting that \u201cthe plaintiff 'harbors too much anger ... which affects her dealings with\u2019 the defendant\").</p>\n</footnote>\n<footnote label=\"10\">\n<p id=\"b626-7\">. Father maintains that there is an \u201congoing debate\u201d about whether the notion of tie-breaking authority is consonant with joint legal custody. His argument, which rests entirely on a conflict between two New York state intermediate appellate decisions, is belied by the substantial number of jurisdictions that have affirmed awards of joint custody with tie-breaking provisions.</p>\n</footnote>\n<footnote label=\"11\">\n<p id=\"b627-6\">. The American Law Institute (\"ALI\u201d) supports the allocation of decision-making authority to parents jointly.

Importantly, the ALI states that \"[d]ecision[-]making responsibility may be allocated as a whole, <em>or by separate areas.\u201d Id. </em>\u00a7 2.09 cmt. a (emphasis added); <em>see also id. </em>\u00a7 2.09 cmt. b., illus. 1 (\"The court should allocate decision[-]making responsibility for health care for Paul in the parenting plan to either Roger or Mary [Paul\u2019s divorced parents].

In <em>Shulick, </em>however, the court read a Michigan custody statute to provide for a joint custody arrangement \" <em>\u2018only where </em>\"the parents will be able to cooperate [and generally agree on matters concerning important decisions affecting the welfare of]\" their children.'\" <em>Id. </em>at 539 (emphasis added) (citation omitted). FL \u00a7 5-203(d) however, does not limit a trial court's power to award custody, and so <em>Shulick </em>is inapposite.</p>\n</footnote>\n<footnote label=\"14\">\n<p id=\"b629-9\">.

Taylor, </em>306 Md. 290, 508 A.2d 964 (1986) does not act as a bar to joint custody where the parties are unable to effectively communicate. <em>See </em>Maj. Op. at 630-31, 645-46, 141 A.3d at 79-80, 88-89. In <em>Taylor, </em>this Court expressly acknowledged that in unusual cases joint custody may be appropriate despite parents\u2019 inability to effectively communicate with each other. In <em>Taylor, id. </em>at 307, 508 A.2d at 972, we explained:</p>\n<blockquote id=\"b637-10\">In the unusual case where the trial [court] concludes that joint legal custody is appropriate notwithstanding the absence of a \u201ctrack record\u201d of willingness and ability on the part of the parents to cooperate in making decisions dealing with the child\u2019s welfare, the trial [court] must articulate fully the reasons that support that conclusion.</blockquote>\n<p id=\"b637-11\">(Emphasis added). As <em>Taylor </em>permits, here, the Circuit Court for Montgomery County ordered joint legal custody, notwithstanding evidence of the parties\u2019 inability to effectively communicate with each other. Stated otherwise, the evidence established that this was the unusual case that warranted such a result, and the trial court fully articulated the reasons supporting that conclusion.</p>\n<p id=\"b637-12\"><em>Taylor </em>has served the State well for thirty years, and establishes that an order of joint legal custody despite parents\u2019 inability to communicate should be \u201cthe unusual case[,]\u201d not the norm. <em>Id. </em>at 307, 508 A.2d at 972. The rationale for joint legal custody being the unusual case where parents are unable to communicate seems obvious; children should not be placed <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"648\">*648</page-number>in a contentious environment, between embattled parents, unless there is no other alternative that achieves the goal of serving their best interests. The Majority did not alter <em>Taylor </em>to reach the correct result in this case. I fear, however, that in endorsing a trial court\u2019s ability to order joint legal custody where the evidence establishes that the parties are unable to communicate effectively and make joint decisions, the Majority did not include the caveat explicitly set forth in <em>Taylor </em>that such a result is to be the unusual or infrequent case. Given that the majority opinion does not purport to alter or abridge <em>Taylor </em>in any manner, <em>Taylor </em>in its entirety \u2014 including the observation that an award of joint legal custody despite the ability of the parents to effectively communicate is the unusual case \u2014 remains good law. From my perspective, this is an important point that should not be overlooked.</p>\n<p id=\"b638-5\">For the above reasons, respectfully, I concur.</p>\n<judges id=\"b638-6\">Judge BATTAGLIA has authorized me to state that she joins in this opinion.</judges>\n</opinion>\n</casebody>\n",
