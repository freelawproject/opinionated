Kentucky, </em>559 U.S. 356, 374, 369, 130 S.Ct. 1473, 176 L.Ed.2d 284 (2010), the Supreme Court held for the first time that, pursuant to the Sixth Amendment right to counsel, \u201ccounsel must inform [his or] her client whether his [or her] plea carries a risk of deportation[,]\u201d and that, \u201cwhen <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"666\">*666</page-number>the deportation consequence is truly clear, ... the duty to give correct advice is equally clear.\u201d After <em>Padilla, </em>in <em>Denisyuk v. State, </em>422 Md. 462, 466, 30 A.3d 914, 916 (2011), this Court held, in relevant part, that \u201cdefense counsel\u2019s failure to advise [the defendant] of the deportation consequence of his guilty plea was constitutionally deficient[,]\u201d and that, \u201cbased on the record developed at the postconviction hearing and the [postconviction] court\u2019s express finding on the subject, [] counsel\u2019s deficient performance prejudiced [the defendant].\u201d Additionally, in the wake of <em>Padilla, </em>courts in other jurisdictions have held that a defendant\u2019s counsel\u2019s performance was constitutionally deficient where the defendant\u2019s counsel either failed to advise the defendant whatsoever of the immigration consequences of the defendant\u2019s guilty plea, or affirmatively misadvised the defendant about the immigration consequences of the defendant\u2019s guilty plea. Murkier, however, are the waters where a defendant\u2019s counsel advises that an offense is deportable and uses \u201cqualifying\u201d words \u2014 such as \u201cvery likely be deported,\u201d <em>Chacon v. State, </em>409 S.W.3d 529, 532 (Mo.Ct.App.2013) (emphasis omitted), or \u201cstrong chance\u201d of being deported, <em>State v. Shota, </em>364 Wis.2d 63, 868 N.W.2d 93, 96 (2015) \u2014 when advising a defendant of the immigration consequences attendant to a plea.</p>\n<p id=\"b656-5\">In this case, we must decide whether defense counsel\u2019s advice \u2014 that there \u201ccould and probably would be immigration consequences\u201d for the defendant\u2019s conviction for second-degree child abuse because it was a \u201cdeportable\u201d or \u201cpossibly deportable\u201d offense \u2014 was constitutionally deficient because defense counsel \u201cqualified\u201d his advice, or was correct advice that adequately informed the defendant of the risk of deportation. We hold that, where the coram nobis court found that defense counsel advised the defendant that \u201cthis was a \u2018deportable offense\u2019 and [the defendant] \u2018could be deported ... if the federal government chose to initiate deportation proceedings,\u2019 and it was \u2018possible\u2019 that the [defendant] would be deported[,]\u201d and where defense counsel testified that he also advised the defendant that \u201cthere could and probably would be immigration consequences\u201d and \u201cthat it was a deportable or a possibly <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"667\">*667</page-number>deportable offense,\u201d and the advice was given before a plea of not guilty by way of an agreed statement of facts proceeding, such advice was not constitutionally deficient, but rather was \u201ccorrect advice\u201d about the \u201crisk of deportation,\u201d as required by <em>Padilla, </em>559 U.S. at 369, 374, 130 S.Ct. 1473.</p>\n<p id=\"b657-4\">BACKGROUND</p>\n<p id=\"b657-5\">On June 8, 2010, Juan Carlos Sanmart\u00edn Prado (\u201cSanmart\u00edn Prado\u201d), Respondent, a citizen of Ecuador and a legal permanent resident of the United States, was charged by criminal information filed in the Circuit Court for Baltimore County (\u201cthe circuit court\u201d) with first-degree child abuse causing severe physical injury, second-degree child abuse, and second-degree assault against his three-year-old daughter. On January 6, 2011, Sanmart\u00edn Prado pleaded not guilty by way of an agreed statement of facts to Count 2, second-degree child abuse,<footnotemark>1</footnotemark> pursuant to an agreement with the State.<footnotemark>2</footnotemark> At that time, Sanmart\u00edn Prado\u2019s trial counsel (\u201ctrial counsel\u201d) engaged <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"668\">*668</page-number>in a waiver colloquy with Sanmart\u00edn Prado; and the following exchange occurred as to Sanmart\u00edn Prado\u2019s immigration status:</p>\n<blockquote id=\"b658-4\">[TRIAL COUNSEL]: And understand what \u2014 we have had discussions with respect to your immigration status.</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b658-5\">Is that correct?</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b658-6\">[SANMARTIN PRADO]: Yes, sir.</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b658-7\">[TRIAL COUNSEL]: You have a green card and you have been a permanent resident of the United States for over twelve years, is that correct?</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b658-8\">[SANMARTIN PRADO]: Yes, sir.</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b658-9\">[TRIAL COUNSEL]: You are not under an active deportation order?</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b658-10\">[SANMARTIN PRADO]: No.</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b658-11\">[TRIAL COUNSEL]: And there\u2019s no immigration detainer that we are aware of.</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b658-12\">Is that correct?</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b658-13\">[SANMARTIN PRADO]: That\u2019s correct.</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b658-14\">[TRIAL COUNSEL]: And you understand that I\u2019m not making any promises and the [circuit court] is not making any promises about what the federal government could possibly do in the future with respect to reviewing this conviction.</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b658-15\">Is that correct?</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b658-16\">[SANMARTIN PRADO]: Yes, sir.</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b658-17\">[TRIAL COUNSEL]: And you still wish to proceed this morning?</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b658-18\">[SANMARTIN PRADO]: Yes, sir.</blockquote>\n<p id=\"b658-19\">Thereafter, the circuit court announced that \u201cSanmart\u00edn Prado ha[d] waived his rights to a jury trial and to a Court trial in this matter, and that he ha[d] done so voluntarily and understanding the rights that he has.\u201d</p>\n<p id=\"b658-20\">The State then read into the record the following agreed statement of facts:</p>\n<blockquote id=\"b659-3\"><page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"669\">*669</page-number>[O]n April 28th, 2010, the Crimes Against Children\u2019s Unit of the Baltimore County Police Department received information regarding a possible child abuse that occurred to a three-year-old named B[.<footnotemark>3</footnotemark>]</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b659-4\">The matter was assigned to Detective Lane to investigate. Detective Lane\u2019s investigation revealed that on 4-18-2010, ten days earlier, the child was in her father, ... Sanmart\u00edn Prado\u2019s care and during that time she sustained a serious burn to the left side of her face.</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b659-5\">During that time the mother of the child, Gina Salinas became aware of the burn.</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b659-6\">Together [ ] Salinas and [ ] Sanmart\u00edn Prado made the decision not to take the child to the hospital, however, the next day, April 19th 2010, the child was taken to Johns Hopkins Hospital. There the mother and [Sanmart\u00edn Prado] told the hospital staff a story that consisted of this being an accident. The child was in the bath tub, she turned the water on and she burnt her face.</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b659-7\">The police were not called at that time. Days later the police were informed of this injury. The police did interview [ ] Salinas and she told the police that she had left her child B[.] with [Sanmart\u00edn Prado] while she worked and when she came home from work she found B[.] to have a serious burn to the left side of her face.</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b659-8\">[Sanmart\u00edn Prado] was subsequently interviewed by Detective Lane on May 3rd of 2010. All of this happening well after the child had received care and treatment for what was determined to be second and third degree burns on the left side of her face.</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b659-9\">By this point those burns had scabbed over. The injury was just a discoloration to the child\u2019s face, however, on May 3rd, 2010, while speaking with Detective Lane, [Sanmart\u00edn Prado] after being Mirandized did agree that on April 18th, 2010, while his wife worked, he cared for his children. At <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"670\">*670</page-number>some point B[.] woke up from her nap and she was inconsolable. She was crying for her mother and, as he had done in the past, he took the spray from the shower head and as she sat in the bathroom on the toilet he sprayed the water at her. [Sanmart\u00edn Prado] would say that most of the water went on the floor, however, the child continued to cry, he believed crying still for her mother.</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b660-5\">He would say that he had no idea that the water was as hot as it was.</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b660-6\">The bath tub was examined and it was that the faucet was just one faucet for both cold and hot water. The water temp \u2014 well, [Sanmart\u00edn Prado] said that he sprayed his daughter in the facial area and the body for approximately two minutes. The water temp was tested and it was found that after one minute that the water would reach a temperature of 128 degrees.</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b660-7\">Studies have shown that at 122 degrees the skin will burn after one minute.</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b660-8\">Again, if called to testify, [] Salinas, the mother, would attest she was not home when the burns occurred. Again Detective Lane would attest that [Sanmart\u00edn Prado] admitted that as a course of punishment he turned the water on his child not meaning to burn her, is \u2014 would be his words, but that he did, in fact, spray her with the water and that did in fact cause burns that were subsequently seen approximately ten days after being treated.</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b660-9\">All events occurred in Baltimore County, and that would be the State\u2019s case.</blockquote>\n<p id=\"b660-10\">The circuit court found Sanmart\u00edn Prado guilty of second-degree child abuse, and sentenced him to five years\u2019 imprisonment with all but two years suspended, followed by two years of supervised probation with the condition that Sanmart\u00edn Prado complete a physical offender treatment program and a parenting course offered by the Department of Social Services. The charges for first-degree child abuse causing severe physical injury and second-degree assault were nol prossed. Sanmart\u00edn Prado did not appeal the conviction.</p>\n<p id=\"b661-4\"><page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"671\">*671</page-number>Over two years later, on October 21, 2013, Sanmart\u00edn Prado filed in the circuit court a \u201cPetition for Writ of Error Coram Nobis\u201d (\u201cthe petition\u201d), contending that, as a result of the conviction, he was facing a significant collateral consequence, namely, \u201cthat he is automatically deportable from the United States[J\u201d Sanmart\u00edn Prado stated that, as of the time of the filing of the petition, he was \u201cin proceedings before the Immigration Court with one of the allegations being the conviction in the [] case to substantiate or to support the government\u2019s claim for deportation.\u201d Sanmart\u00edn Prado alleged that his trial counsel had rendered ineffective assistance of counsel at the January 6, 2011 plea hearing by failing to advise him that he was subject to automatic deportation as a result of the conviction, and by failing to specify what immigration consequences he could face as a result of conviction, including being subject to automatic deportation. According to Sanmart\u00edn Prado, had he known that he would be subject to automatic deportation as a result of the conviction, he would not have pled not guilty on an agreed statement of facts, and instead would have gone to trial. On November 18, 2013, the State filed an answer and motion to dismiss the petition without a hearing, contending, in pertinent part, that trial counsel properly advised Sanmart\u00edn Prado of the potential immigration consequences of a conviction.</p>\n<p id=\"b661-5\">On January 28, 2014, the circuit court conducted a hearing on the petition. At the hearing, Sanmart\u00edn Prado called trial counsel as a witness. Trial counsel testified that he visited Sanmart\u00edn Prado in jail before the January 6, 2011 proceeding, and the following exchange occurred concerning trial counsel\u2019s discussions with Sanmart\u00edn Prado about the immigration consequences of a conviction:</p>\n<blockquote id=\"b661-6\">[CORAM NOBIS COUNSEL]: Now, when you discussed these matters with [ ] Sanmart\u00edn [Prado], did you ask him if he was a citizen of the United States?</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b661-7\">[TRIAL COUNSEL]: I don\u2019t know if I exactly asked him if he was a citizen, I asked him where he was born, he told me he was from Ecuador, he came to the United States with his mother when he was eighteen and he told me that he was a <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"672\">*672</page-number>permanent resident and had a green card and had, had so had that green card since 1998. That\u2019s what my notes reflect.</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b662-5\">[CORAM NOBIS COUNSEL]: But did you, you did not determine whether or not, since 1998, he had become a citizen?</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b662-6\">[TRIAL COUNSEL]: No, I knew he was not a naturalized U.S. citizen, if that\u2019s your question.</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b662-7\">[CORAM NOBIS COUNSEL]: Now, after having gotten that information, what, if anything, did you explore to determine if any problems he might have with immigration?</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b662-8\">[TRIAL COUNSEL]: On December ... 30th of 2010,1 met with [Sanmart\u00edn Prado] for the final time at the Detention Center. I explained to him that the, there could and probably would be immigration consequences as a result of the plea but that the, the term of art that I usually use is that immigration is a moving target and that it was, I recall telling him that it was a deportable or a possibly deportable offense, but the plea agreement that the State had offered, he indicated to me that he was interested in taking that and my notes, written on the inside of my file jacket, I can read them verbatim if you\u2019d like.</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b662-9\">[CORAM NOBIS COUNSEL]: That\u2019s fine. If that refreshes your recollection, that\u2019s fine.</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b662-10\">[TRIAL COUNSEL]: It says, [Sanmart\u00edn Prado] wants deal, prefer Alford plea, quote, cannot admit guilty, unquote, spoke extensively re imm, I-M-M-period, consequences.</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b662-11\">[CIRCUIT COURT]: I\u2019m sorry, slow down,\u2014</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b662-12\">[TRIAL COUNSEL]: Which I would take to be immigration consequences.</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b662-13\">[CORAM NOBIS COUNSEL]: Okay. What did you explain to him about immigration consequences?</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b663-3\"><page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"673\">*673</page-number>[TRIAL COUNSEL]: That it\u2019s a deportable offense and he could be deported if the Federal government chooses to deport him.</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b663-4\">[CORAM NOBIS COUNSEL]: Why is it a deportable offense?</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b663-5\">[TRIAL COUNSEL]: Because it is an aggravated felony which carries more than a year in jail.</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b663-6\">[CORAM NOBIS COUNSEL]: And where did you get that information from?</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b663-7\">[TRIAL COUNSEL]: My, I\u2019ve always wanted to say this, my training, knowledge and experience as a lawyer.</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"AFL\">[CORAM NOBIS COUNSEL]: That\u2019s good. Nothing wrong with that. And at the time that you advised my client\u2014</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b663-8\">[CIRCUIT COURT]: Can, can you go, hold on, [coram nobis counsel]. [Trial counsel], you told, you testified that you told [Sanmart\u00edn Prado], the question to you was, what consequences did you advise him of and what you said to [Sanmart\u00edn] Prado was that it was a deportable offense, he could be deported and then what did you say, if the immigration officials?</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b663-9\">[TRIAL COUNSEL]: If the Federal government chooses to exercise their right to deport him.</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b663-10\">[CIRCUIT COURT]: Okay.</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b663-11\">[TRIAL COUNSEL]: Or to, to initiate deportation proceedings.</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b663-12\">[CORAM NOBIS COUNSEL]: Nowhere in that colloquy [during the January 6, 2011 proceeding] do you ever tell [ ] Sanmart\u00edn Prado that he\u2019s automatically deportable as a result of the conviction in this case, correct?</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b663-13\">[TRIAL COUNSEL]: No.</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b663-14\">[CORAM NOBIS COUNSEL]: [D]id you ever tell [ ] Sanmart\u00edn Prado that the conviction would make him automatically deportable under all circumstances?</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b664-4\"><page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"674\">*674</page-number>[TRIAL COUNSEL]: I don\u2019t know if I used the term automatic but I certainly said it was a deportable offense, so.</blockquote>\n<p id=\"b664-5\">Trial counsel also testified that he met with Sanmart\u00edn Prado\u2019s wife and that his \u201cnotes d[id] not reflect that we discussed the possible immigration consequences[,] but I can\u2019t believe I would not have discussed those with her[.]\u201d</p>\n<p id=\"b664-6\">On cross-examination, the prosecutor asked trial counsel what he meant \u201cby deportation is a moving target[,]\u201d to which trial counsel responded:</p>\n<blockquote id=\"b664-7\">Especially back in 2009, 2010 even, early into 2011, I found that there was sort of some arbitrary enforcement of the Federal immigration laws. Some people were getting deported, other people were not. Some people were getting deportation orders. So, you know, I guess, in hindsight, you know, I shouldn\u2019t have used the term moving target but I think it was clear to [Sanmart\u00edn Prado] and I think I made it pretty clear on the record that this was deportable and he and I discussed that and that that was a very real collateral consequence to the plea.</blockquote>\n<p id=\"b664-8\">When asked by the prosecutor \u201cat no time did you tell [Sanmart\u00edn] Prado you will not be deported as a result of this case[,]\u201d trial counsel emphatically testified: \u201cI absolutely, positively did not tell him you, because if I, if that, if I were that certain, I would have not had the discussion at all.\u201d</p>\n<p id=\"b664-9\">Sanmart\u00edn Prado testified on his own behalf through the assistance of a Spanish-language interpreter. According to Sanmart\u00edn Prado, he saw trial counsel at the jail twice without the assistance of an interpreter. Coram nobis counsel asked about Sanmart\u00edn Prado\u2019s discussions with trial counsel about immigration consequences and the following exchange occurred:</p>\n<blockquote id=\"b664-10\">[CORAM NOBIS COUNSEL]: Did you know when you went to Court that if you were found guilty, you would be deported to your home country?</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b664-11\">[SANMARTIN PRADO]: No.</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b665-4\"><page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"675\">*675</page-number>[CORAM NOBIS COUNSEL]: Okay. Did anybody tell you that could happen, either [trial counsel] or anybody else, before you went to Court?</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b665-5\">[SANMARTIN PRADO]: No.</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b665-6\">[CORAM NOBIS COUNSEL]: Okay. When did you first find out that you were subject to, or you were going to be deported as a result of your case?</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b665-7\">[SANMARTIN PRADO]: About maybe six months after I got out from jail, they came to the house, nobody told me anything, [Immigration and Customs Enforcement] came to the house.</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b665-8\">[CORAM NOBIS COUNSEL]: Okay. Now, if you would have known that you would be deported by being convicted, would you have not asked for a trial or would you have asked for a trial, in your case, an actual trial?</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b665-9\">[SANMARTIN PRADO]: Yes.</blockquote>\n<p id=\"b665-10\">On cross-examination, Sanmart\u00edn Prado testified that trial counsel never advised him that he could be deported, but acknowledged that he and trial counsel had discussed his immigration status:</p>\n<blockquote id=\"b665-11\">[PROSECUTOR]: Sir, it\u2019s your testimony that [trial counsel] never told you that you could be deported because of this crime?</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b665-12\">[SANMARTIN PRADO]: He never told me, maybe he told me in other words that I did not understand, but he never told me about deportation.</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b665-13\">* \u2756 *</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b665-14\">[PROSECUTOR]: Did [trial counsel] ask you regarding your immigration status? ... Sir, isn\u2019t it true that [trial counsel] asked you if you were a citizen of this country?</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"AOr\">[SANMARTIN PRADO]: He asked me but I said no I was a resident.</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b665-15\">[PROSECUTOR]: Okay. So did you talk about your green card and your status in this country?</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b665-16\">[SANMARTIN PRADO]: Yes.</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b666-3\"><page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"676\">*676</page-number>[PROSECUTOR]: So you admit that [trial counsel] did have conversations regarding your immigration status?</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"AST\">[SANMARTIN PRADO]: Yes. Because the first time he saw me, he asked me if I was a resident and I told him yes.</blockquote>\n<p id=\"A0L\">And, in response to the prosecutor\u2019s question \u201cDid [trial counsel] ever tell you you would not be deported as a result of this crime or he never talked to you about deportation?[,]\u201d Sanmart\u00edn Prado stated: \u201cHe never talked about that.\u201d</p>\n<p id=\"b666-4\">On June 12, 2014, the coram nobis court issued a Memorandum and Order denying the petition. In relevant part, the circuit court found:</p>\n<blockquote id=\"b666-5\">[A]t the coram nobis hearing, [ ] trial counsel testified, and the Court finds as a fact, that he met with [Sanmart\u00edn Prado] at the Baltimore County Detention Center before trial and explained the immigration consequences of a guilty verdict, including that this was a \u201cdeportable offense\u201d and [Sanmart\u00edn Prado] \u201ccould be deported ... if the federal government chose to initiate deportation proceedings,\u201d and it was \u201cpossible\u201d that [Sanmart\u00edn Prado] would be deported. [Sanmart\u00edn Prado] testified that trial counsel never told him he \u201cwould be deported[,]\u201d but acknowledged that he did have conversations with trial counsel regarding his immigration status.</blockquote>\n<p id=\"b666-6\">The circuit court ruled:</p>\n<blockquote id=\"b666-7\">Upon consideration of the evidence presented to this Court as well as the record of the plea hearing, the Court finds that [Sanmart\u00edn Prado] has not rebutted the presumption that he \u201cintelligently and knowingly\u201d failed to raise the allegation on appeal and [Sanmart\u00edn Prado] has made no showing that special circumstances exist for his failure to make the allegation of error on appeal.</blockquote>\n<p id=\"b666-8\">On July 9, 2014, Sanmart\u00edn Prado filed a notice of appeal. On October 2, 2015, in a reported opinion, the Court of Special Appeals reversed the judgment of the circuit court and remanded the case to the circuit court for further proceedings. <em>See Sanmartin Prado v. State, </em>225 Md.App. 201, 214, 123 A.3d 652, 660 (2015). Relevant here, the Court of Special Appeals <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"677\">*677</page-number>held that \u201ctrial counsel qualified his statements to Sanmart\u00edn Prado as to whether a conviction would render him deportable[,]\u201d and that, accordingly, \u201cSanmart\u00edn Prado established that [ ] trial counsel did not provide him with the correct \u2018available advice\u2019 about the deportation risk.\u201d <em>Id. </em>at 213, 123 A.3d at 659. Because Sanmart\u00edn Prado had established the first prong of the Strickland<footnotemark>4</footnotemark> test, the Court \u201cremand[ed] the case to the circuit court to [determine] whether there is a reasonable probability that, but for trial counsel\u2019s unprofessional errors, the result of the proceedings would have been different.\u201d <em>Id. </em>at 213-14, 123 A.3d at 660 (citation omitted). Thereafter, the State filed in this Court a petition for a writ of <em>certiorari, </em>which we granted. <em>See State v. Sanmartin Prado, </em>446 Md. 291, 132 A.3d 193 (2016).</p>\n<p id=\"b667-5\">DISCUSSION</p>\n<p id=\"A1p\">The Parties\u2019 Contentions</p>\n<p id=\"b667-6\">The State contends that the Court of Special Appeals erred in holding that trial counsel\u2019s advisement to Sanmart\u00edn Prado about the possible immigration consequences of conviction was constitutionally deficient, and that the Court\u2019s holding is inconsistent with <em>Padilla, </em>559 U.S. 356, 130 S.Ct. 1473, and this Court\u2019s holding in <em>Denisyuk, </em>422 Md. 462, 30 A.3d 914. According to the State, under <em>Padilla </em>and <em>Denisyuk, </em>a lawyer must advise his or her client of whether there is a \u201crisk of deportation\u201d and \u201cthat deportation is a likely consequence of [a] guilty plea.\u201d (Citations omitted). The State argues that trial counsel\u2019s advice and representation to Sanmart\u00edn Prado \u201cfully comported\u201d with <em>Padilla </em>and <em>Denisyuk </em>because trial counsel advised Sanmart\u00edn Prado that second-degree child abuse was a deportable offense and that there could and probably would be immigration consequences if he were convicted of the offense. The State asserts that, unlike in <em>Padilla </em>or <em>Denisyuk, </em>trial counsel in this case neither failed altogether <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"678\">*678</page-number>to advise Sanmart\u00edn Prado concerning immigration consequences, nor misadvised Sanmart\u00edn Prado about the immigration consequences. The State maintains that the holding of the Court of Special Appeals sets a new standard, and is inconsistent with other jurisdictions\u2019 holdings in the wake of <em>Padilla, </em>and with the standard set forth in Maryland Rule 4-242(f) (Collateral Consequences of a Plea of Guilty, Conditional Plea of Guilty, or Plea of Nolo Contendere).</p>\n<p id=\"b668-5\">Sanmart\u00edn Prado responds that the Court of Special Appeals correctly held that trial counsel failed to properly advise him in open court of the immigration consequences of a conviction in accordance with <em>Padilla </em>and <em>Denisyuk. </em>According to Sanmart\u00edn Prado, the Court of Special Appeals correctly concluded that proper advisement of immigration consequences consists of defense counsel advising a defendant that he or she is \u201cdeportable,\u201d without any qualification, such as \u201cif the federal government cho[o]se[s] to initiate deportation proceedings,\u201d \u201cpossibly deportable,\u201d or similar qualifiers. Sanmart\u00edn Prado argues that trial counsel\u2019s advisement was deficient because trial counsel neither advised that deportation was mandatory and automatic nor advised \u201cwithout equivocation\u201d that Sanmart\u00edn Prado was deportable. Sanmart\u00edn Prado asserts that trial counsel misadvised him of the immigration consequences of a conviction by equivocating and stating that he \u201ccould be deportable or probably would be deportable and that immigration is a moving target[.]\u201d Sanmart\u00edn Prado maintains that trial counsel\u2019s advisements led him to believe that there was a possibility that there would be no immigration consequences for a conviction. Sanmart\u00edn Prado also contends that the advisements in this case violated Maryland Rule 4-242, which Sanmart\u00edn Prado argues requires that an advisement of immigration consequences of a guilty plea be made on the record in open court. In so contending, Sanmart\u00edn Prado points out that, in this case, proceeding by way of a not guilty plea upon an agreed statement of facts was the functional equivalent of a guilty plea.</p>\n<p id=\"b668-6\">In a reply brief, the State contends that <em>Padilla </em>did not require trial counsel to advise Sanmart\u00edn Prado in an unequiv<page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"679\">*679</page-number>ocal statement that he would be deported if convicted. The State also takes the position that, unlike in <em>Padilla </em>and <em>Denisyuk, </em>Sanmart\u00edn Prado did not enter and was not convicted based upon a guilty plea. Stated otherwise, the State theorizes that the not guilty agreed statement of facts arrangement was not the functional equivalent of a guilty plea.</p>\n<p id=\"b669-5\">Standard of Review</p>\n<p id=\"b669-6\">We review without deference a trial court\u2019s resolution of questions of law. <em>See, e.g., State v.

As to a trial court\u2019s determination concerning issues of effective assistance of counsel, in <em>State v.

But, a reviewing court must make an independent analysis to determine the ultimate mixed question of law and fact, namely, was there a violation of a constitutional right as claimed. In other words, the appellate court must exercise its own independent judgment as to the reasonableness of counsel\u2019s conduct and the prejudice, if any----[The appellate court] will evaluate anew the findings of the [trial] court as to the reasonableness of counsel\u2019s conduct and the prejudice suffered.

State, </em>428 Md. 386, 399-400, 51 A.3d 655, 662 (2012), this Court explained that, in Maryland, we follow the test announced by the Supreme Court in <em>Strickland v. Washington, </em>466 U.S. 668, 104 S.Ct. 2052, 80 L.Ed.2d 674 (1984), stating:</p>\n<blockquote id=\"b671-6\">Under both the Sixth Amendment and Article 21 of the Maryland Declaration of Rights,<footnotemark>5</footnotemark> a criminal defendant is entitled to the assistance of counsel, which means \u201cthe right to the effective assistance of counsel.\u201d <em>Duvall v.

The defendant who claims that he or she received ineffective assistance of counsel, as a general rule under the test announced in <em>Strickland </em>and followed ever since, must make two showings: \u201cFirst, the defendant must show that counsel\u2019s performance was deficient. This requires showing that counsel made errors so serious that counsel was not functioning as the \u2018counsel\u2019 guaranteed the defendant by the Sixth Amendment. Second, the defendant must show that the deficient performance prejudiced the defense.\u201d 466 <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"682\">*682</page-number>U.S. at 687[ 104 S.Ct. 2052.] In regard to the first, \u201cperformance\u201d prong of <em>Strickland, </em>the defendant must demonstrate that counsel\u2019s alleged acts or omissions, based on \u201cthe facts of the particular case, viewed as of the time of counsel\u2019s conduct,\u201d fell \u201coutside the wide range of professionally competent assistance.\u201d <em>Id. </em>at 690[ 104 S.Ct. 2052.] In regard to the second, \u201cprejudice\u201d prong, \u201c[t]he defendant must show that there is a reasonable probability that, but for counsel\u2019s unprofessional errors, the result of the proceeding would have been different.

Kentucky</em>\n</p>\n<p id=\"b674-6\">In <em>Padilla, </em>559 U.S. at 369, 360, 130 S.Ct. 1473 the Supreme Court held that \u201cPadilla ha[d] sufficiently alleged constitutional deficiency to satisfy the first prong of <em>Strickland \u201d </em>because \u201cconstitutionally competent counsel would have advised [Padilla] that his conviction for drug distribution made him subject to automatic deportation.\u201d Indeed, for the first time, the Supreme Court held that, pursuant to the Sixth Amendment right to counsel, \u201ccounsel must inform [his or] her client whether his [or her] plea carries a risk of deportation.\u201d <em>Id. </em>at 374, 130 S.Ct. 1473. In <em>Padilla, id. </em>at 359, 130 S.Ct. 1473 Padilla, a native of Honduras who had been a legal permanent resident of the United States for more than forty years, pleaded guilty to transportation of a large amount of marijuana. Padilla later sought post-conviction relief, alleging that his counsel both failed to advise him of the immigration consequences of his plea and misadvised \u201chim that he did not have to worry about his immigration status since he had been in the country so long.\u201d <em>Id. </em>(citation and internal quotation marks omitted). According to Padilla, he relied on his coun<page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"685\">*685</page-number>sel\u2019s erroneous advice when he pleaded guilty, and, had he received correct advice, \u201che would have insisted on going to trial[.]\u201d <em>Id. </em>The Supreme Court of Kentucky concluded that Padilla was not entitled to post-conviction relief. <em>See id. </em>The Supreme Court then granted <em>certiorari </em>to determine \u201cwhether, as a matter of federal law, Padilla\u2019s counsel had an obligation to advise him that the offense to which he was pleading guilty would result in his removal from this country.\u201d <em>Id. </em>at 360, 130 S.Ct. 1473.</p>\n<p id=\"b675-4\">The Supreme Court began by examining the evolution of federal immigration law over the past century, observing that, \u201c[w]hile once there was only a narrow class of deportable offenses and judges wielded broad discretionary authority to prevent deportation, immigration reforms over time have expanded the class of deportable offenses and limited the authority of judges to alleviate the harsh consequences of deportation.\u201d <em>Id. </em>According to the Supreme Court, under current immigration laws, deportation or removal \u201cis now virtually inevitable for a vast number of noncitizens convicted of crimes.\u201d <em>Id. </em>As a result, \u201c[t]he importance of accurate legal advice for noncitizens accused of crimes has never been more important.\u201d <em>Id. </em>at 364, 130 S.Ct. 1473.</p>\n<p id=\"b675-5\">The Supreme Court then determined that the Sixth Amendment right to counsel, and the <em>Strickland </em>test for effective assistance of counsel, were applicable to Padilla\u2019s claim. <em>Id. </em>at 366, 130 S.Ct. 1473. As to the first prong of Strickland\u2014 whether \u201ccounsel\u2019s representation fell below an objective standard of reasonableness\u201d \u2014 the Supreme Court stated that \u201c[t]he weight of prevailing professional norms supports the view that counsel must advise [his or] her client regarding the risk of deportation.\u201d <em>Id. </em>at 366-67, 130 S.Ct. 1473 (citations and internal quotation marks omitted). Considering the circumstances of Padilla\u2019s case, the Supreme Court explained:</p>\n<blockquote id=\"A_S\">In the instant case, the terms of the relevant immigration statute are succinct, clear, and explicit in defining the removal consequences for Padilla\u2019s conviction. See 8 U.S.C. \u00a7 1227(a)(2)(B)\u00ae (\u201cAny alien who at any time after admission has been convicted of a violation of (or a conspiracy or <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"686\">*686</page-number>attempt to violate) any law or regulation of a State, the United States or a foreign country relating to a controlled substance ..., other than a single offense involving possession for one\u2019s own use of 30 grams or less or marijuana, is deportable\u201d). Padilla\u2019s counsel could have easily determined that his plea would make him eligible for deportation simply from reading the text of the statute, which addresses not some broad classification of crimes but specifically commands removal for all controlled substances convictions except for the most trivial of marijuana possession offenses. Instead, Padilla\u2019s counsel provided him false assurance that his conviction would not result in his removal from this country. This is not a hard case in which to find deficiency: The consequences of Padilla\u2019s plea could easily be determined from reading the removal statute, his deportation was presumptively mandatory, and his counsel\u2019s advice was incorrect.</blockquote>\n<p id=\"b676-5\"><em>Padilla, </em>559 U.S. at 368-69, 130 S.Ct. 1473 (ellipsis in original). The Supreme Court nonetheless recognized that \u201c[i]m-migration law can be complex,\u201d and that there may be \u201csituations in which the deportation consequences of a particular plea are unclear or uncertain.\u201d <em>Id. </em>at 369, 130 S.Ct. 1473. Under those circumstances, \u201c[w]hen the law is not succinct and straightforward ..., a criminal defense attorney need do no more than advise a noncitizen client that pending criminal charges may carry a risk of adverse immigration consequences.\u201d <em>Id. </em>(footnote omitted). However, \u201cwhen the deportation consequence is truly clear, as it was in [Padilla\u2019s] case, the duty to give correct advice is equally clear.\u201d <em>Id. </em>(emphasis added). Thus, the Supreme Court concluded that Padilla had sufficiently alleged that his counsel provided constitutionally deficient representation, satisfying the first prong of <em>Strickland, </em>and that the Kentucky courts would need to determine \u201cin the first instance\u201d whether Padilla had satisfied the second prong of <em>Strickland, </em>concerning prejudice. <em>Id.</em></p>\n<p id=\"b676-6\">The Supreme Court also rejected the United States\u2019s contention that <em>\u201cStrickland </em>applies to Padilla\u2019s claim only to the extent that he ha[d] alleged affirmative misadvice.\u201d <em>Id. </em>Ac<page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"687\">*687</page-number>cording to the Supreme Court, such a holding would lead to \u201ctwo absurd results\u201d:</p>\n<blockquote id=\"b677-4\">First, it would give counsel an incentive to remain silent on matters of great importance, even when answers are readily available. Silence under these circumstances would be fundamentally at odds with the critical obligation of counsel to advise the client of the advantages and disadvantages of a plea agreement. When attorneys know that their clients face possible exile from this country and separation from their families, they should not be encouraged to say nothing at all. Second, it would deny a class of clients least able to represent themselves the most rudimentary advice on deportation even when it is readily available. It is quintessentially the duty of counsel to provide [his or] her client with available advice about an issue like deportation and the failure to do so clearly satisfies the first prong of the <em>Strickland </em>analysis.</blockquote>\n<p id=\"b677-5\"><em>Id. </em>at 370-71, 130 S.Ct. 1473 (citations, footnote, and internal quotation marks omitted). The Supreme Court noted, though, that \u201c[s]urmounting <em>Strickland\u2019s </em>high bar is never an easy task.\u201d <em>Id. </em>at 371, 130 S.Ct. 1473 (citations omitted). The Supreme Court concluded as follows:</p>\n<blockquote id=\"b677-6\">It is our responsibility under the Constitution to ensure that no criminal defendant \u2014 whether a citizen or not \u2014 is left to the mercies of incompetent counsel. To satisfy this responsibility, we now hold that counsel must inform [his or] her client whether his [or her] plea carries a risk of deportation. Our longstanding Sixth Amendment precedents, the seriousness of deportation as a consequence of a criminal plea, and the concomitant impact of deportation on families living lawfully in this country demand no less.</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b677-7\">Taking as true the basis for his motion for postconviction relief, we have little difficulty concluding that Padilla has sufficiently alleged that his counsel was constitutionally deficient. Whether Padilla is entitled to relief will depend on whether he can demonstrate prejudice as a result thereof, a question we do not reach because it was not passed on below.</blockquote>\n<p id=\"b678-4\"><page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"688\">*688</page-number><em>Id. </em>at 374-75, 130 S.Ct. 1473 (emphasis added) (citations and internal quotation marks omitted).</p>\n<p id=\"b678-5\">\n<em>Denisyuk v.

In <em>Denisyuk, </em>422 Md. at 466-67, 30 A.3d at 916, the defendant, a noncitizen, pleaded guilty to second-degree assault pursuant to a plea agreement. At the guilty plea proceeding, neither defense counsel, the State, nor the trial court advised the defendant of the immigration consequences of the plea. <em>See id. </em>at 467, 30 A.3d at 917. Later, the defendant filed a petition for post-conviction relief, alleging that the guilty plea was involuntary because he was not advised of the potential immigration consequences of the plea and that defense counsel\u2019s failure to advise him of the potential immigration conse<page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"689\">*689</page-number>quences of the plea constituted ineffective assistance of counsel. <em>See id. </em>at 467, 30 A.3d at 917.

The trial court granted the petition for post-conviction relief, and the State thereafter filed an application for leave to appeal, which was granted. <em>See id. </em>at 468, 30 A.3d at 917-18. The Court of Special Appeals reversed the grant of post-conviction relief. <em>See id. </em>at 468, 30 A.3d at 918. This Court then granted <em>certiorari.

We explained that, because the defendant\u2019s \u201csworn statement that he would have opted to go to trial if he had known of the likelihood of deportation, which was credited by the court, had he received the advice required by <em>Padilla, </em>he would have opted to go to trial[,]\u201d the defendant had satisfied the second prong of <em>Strickland, i.e., </em>demonstrated that he was prejudiced by \u201chis counsel\u2019s deficient performance.\u201d <em>Id. </em>at 489, 30 A.3d at 930. Accordingly, because the defendant had satisfied both prongs of <em>Strickland </em>and thus demonstrated that his counsel had provided ineffective assistance, we agreed with the trial court that the defendant should be granted a new trial. <em>See id. </em>at 489, 30 A.3d at 930.</p>\n<p id=\"b680-4\"><page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"690\">*690</page-number>Authority from Other Jurisdictions</p>\n<p id=\"b680-5\">Similarly, courts in other jurisdictions have held that a defendant\u2019s counsel\u2019s performance was constitutionally deficient where the defendant\u2019s counsel either failed to advise the defendant whatsoever of the immigration consequences of the defendant\u2019s guilty plea, or affirmatively misadvised the defendant about the immigration consequences of the defendant\u2019s guilty plea. For example, in <em>United States v. Bonilla, </em>637 F.3d 980, 981 (9th Cir.2011), the Ninth Circuit held that the trial court abused its discretion in denying the defendant\u2019s motion to withdraw his guilty plea where, after entering his guilty plea, the defendant \u201cwas for the first time informed that he would be deported on the basis of his plea[.]\u201d In <em>Bonilla, id., </em>the defendant, a native of Mexico, was charged by indictment with possessing an unregistered firearm and being a felon in possession of a firearm. After the indictment, the defendant\u2019s wife contacted an investigator with the Federal Public Defender\u2019s Office to ask whether the defendant could possibly be deported as a result of the charges; the investigator told the defendant\u2019s wife to contact the defendant\u2019s counsel; the defendant\u2019s wife then asked the defendant\u2019s counsel whether the defendant could possibly be deported if he pleaded guilty, and the defendant\u2019s counsel told the wife \u201cthat she would look into the matter but never did, and failed to provide any information about immigration consequences to [the defendant] or his wife prior to the plea hearing.\u201d <em>Id. </em>at 981-82. The defendant pleaded guilty to both charges. <em>See id. </em>at 982. Afterwards, the defendant\u2019s wife again asked the defendant\u2019s counsel about the immigration consequences of the guilty plea. <em>See id. </em>Several days later, the defendant\u2019s counsel advised the defendant\u2019s wife that, as a result of the guilty plea, the defendant would be deported after serving his sentence; the defendant\u2019s counsel explained that she had mistakenly believed that the defendant was a United States citizen. <em>See id. </em>The defendant later moved to withdraw his guilty plea; the trial court denied the motion; and the defendant appealed. <em>See id. </em>at 982-83.</p>\n<p id=\"b681-4\"><page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"691\">*691</page-number>The Ninth Circuit explained that it was undisputed that the defendant \u201creceived \u2018inadequate legal advice\u2019 about the immigration consequences of his plea\u201d because, in actuality, the defendant \u201creceived <em>no </em>advice about immigration consequences before entering his plea, only learning afterward that pleading guilty would almost certainly result in deportation.\u201d <em>Id. </em>at 984 (emphasis in original) (citations omitted). The Ninth Circuit stated that \u201c[a] criminal defendant who faces almost certain deportation is entitled to know more than that it is <em>possible </em>that a guilty plea could lead to removal; he is entitled to know that it is a virtual certainty.\u201d <em>Id. </em>(emphasis in original) (citation omitted). And, under the circumstances of the case, the Ninth Circuit determined that, because the defendant\u2019s wife had inquired of counsel the immigration consequences and had been provided no information prior to the defendant pleading guilty, the defendant could reasonably \u201chave inferred that he likely would not be deported if he pled[.]\u201d <em>Id. </em>Indeed, according to the Ninth Circuit, \u201ca reasonable person in [the defendantj\u2019s position could well have interpreted his lawyer\u2019s silence to mean that pleading guilty would not place him in jeopardy of deportation[.]\u201d <em>Id. </em>at 984-85. The Ninth Circuit concluded that, although the defendant may have been aware prior to pleading guilty \u201cabout the <em>possibility </em>that there might be a reason not to plead to the indictment, because of his lawyer\u2019s failure to answer his wife\u2019s question he did not know whether that possibility was likely to have any real consequences.\u201d <em>Id. </em>at 985 (emphasis in original). Indeed, it was only after pleading guilty that the defendant learned \u201cthat the plea would in fact make his deportation virtually certain.\u201d <em>Id. </em>Under those circumstances, the Ninth Circuit held that the trial court abused its discretion in denying the defendant\u2019s motion to withdraw his plea. <em>See id. </em>at 986.</p>\n<p id=\"b681-5\">In a similar vein, in <em>United States v. Akinsade, </em>686 F.3d 248, 250 (4th Cir.2012), the Fourth Circuit reversed the trial court\u2019s denial of the defendant\u2019s petition for writ of error coram nobis where the defendant\u2019s counsel affirmatively misadvised the defendant that he would not be deported. In <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"692\">*692</page-number><em>Akinsade, id., </em>the defendant, a native of Nigeria who became a lawful permanent resident, was charged with embezzlement by a bank employee. The defendant asked his counsel on at least two occasions about the potential immigration consequences of a guilty plea. <em>See id. </em>On each occasion, contrary to the law at that time, the defendant\u2019s counsel \u201cmisadvised him that he could not be deported based on th[e] single offense\u201d and \u201cthat he could only be deported if he had two felony convictions.\u201d <em>Id. </em>Relying on that misadvice, the defendant pleaded guilty pursuant to a plea agreement, which did not mention that deportation was mandatory or possible due to the offense. <em>See id. </em>During the plea proceeding, the trial court reviewed the consequences of the plea, including that, \u201cif you are not a citizen, you could be deported.\u201d <em>Id. </em>The defendant said that he understood and affirmatively stated that he still wished to plead guilty. <em>See id. </em>Years later, while under the threat of deportation, the defendant filed a petition for writ of error coram nobis, alleging ineffective assistance of counsel based on his counsel\u2019s misadvice. <em>See id. </em>at 251. Although holding that the defendant\u2019s counsel\u2019s affirmative misadvice rendered his assistance constitutionally deficient, the trial court denied the petition, concluding that the defendant was not prejudiced. <em>See id. </em>The defendant appealed. <em>See id.</em></p>\n<p id=\"b682-5\">The Fourth Circuit focused its analysis on \u201cthe merits of [the defendant]^ ineffective assistance of counsel claim to decide whether [the defendant] ha[d] been prejudiced.\u201d <em>Id. </em>at 253 (citation omitted). As to that point, the Fourth Circuit acknowledged that \u201c[a] defendant may be unable to show prejudice if at the [plea] proceeding the [trial] court provides an admonishment that corrects the misadvice and the defendant expresses that he [or she] understands the admonishment.\u201d <em>Id. </em>(citations omitted). The Fourth Circuit concluded that the trial court\u2019s admonishment was insufficient to correct the defendant\u2019s counsel\u2019s misadvice that the crime was not a deportable offense because it was not \u201ca careful explanation of the consequences of deportation\u201d and instead simply \u201cwarned that [the defendant\u2019s plea <em>coidd </em>lead to deportation.\u201d <em>Id. </em>at <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"693\">*693</page-number>254 (emphasis in original) (internal quotation marks omitted). The Fourth Circuit concluded \u201cthat counsel\u2019s affirmative misrepresentations that the crime at issue was non-deportable prejudiced\u201d the defendant because the record demonstrated that, but for the misadvice, the defendant would not have pleaded guilty. <em>Id. </em>at 256. Because the defendant had demonstrated prejudice, the Fourth Circuit concluded that he \u201calso demonstrated that he ha[d] suffered a fundamental error necessitating coram nobis relief.\u201d <em>Id.</em></p>\n<p id=\"b683-5\">In the wake of <em>Padilla, </em>courts in various other jurisdictions also have addressed the extent of <em>Padilla\u2019s </em>holding and have grappled with whether counsel\u2019s use of qualifying words when advising a defendant about immigration consequences \u2014 as opposed to counsel\u2019s failing altogether to advise or affirmatively misadvising \u2014 renders that counsel\u2019s performance constitutionally deficient under <em>Strickland. </em>For example, in <em>United States v. Rodriguez-Vega, </em>797 F.3d 781, 784, 788 (9th Cir.2015), the Ninth Circuit held that the trial court \u201cerr[ed] in failing to hold that ... [the defendant\u2019s counsel\u2019s assistance was ineffective\u201d where the defendant\u2019s counsel \u201cnever informed [the defendant before she pleaded guilty] that she faced anything more than the mere \u2018potential\u2019 of removal.\u201d In <em>Rodriguez-Vega, id. </em>at 784, the defendant, a native of Mexico who became a legal permanent resident of the United States, was charged with the felony of attempted transportation of illegal aliens and aiding and abetting. The defendant\u2019s counsel initially presented the defendant with a plea agreement requiring the defendant \u201cto stipulate to removal following her criminal sentence\u201d; the defendant rejected the plea agreement. <em>Id. </em>at 784-85. The defendant\u2019s counsel then presented a revised plea agreement that did not include the stipulation for removal, and instead included a provision entitled \u201cImmigration Consequences,\u201d which stated, in pertinent part:</p>\n<blockquote id=\"AXt\">Defendant recognizes that pleading guilty may have consequences with respect to her immigration status if she is not a citizen of the United States____Defendant nevertheless affirms that she wants to plead guilty regardless of any immigration consequences that [her] plea may entail, even if <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"694\">*694</page-number>the consequence is [her] automatic removal from the United States.</blockquote>\n<p id=\"b684-6\"><em>Id. </em>at 785 (ellipsis in original). The defendant thereafter pleaded guilty to the misdemeanor of attempted transportation of an illegal alien. <em>See id. </em>At the plea proceeding, the magistrate judge advised the defendant that <em>\u201cpotentially </em>[she] could be deported or removed, <em>perhaps.\u201d Id. </em>(emphasis in original). Later, at sentencing, the defendant\u2019s counsel, while addressing the trial court, stated that \u201cthere is a high likelihood that [the defendant would] be deported. It\u2019s still <em>probably </em>considered an aggravated felony for purposes of immigration law.\u201d <em>Id. </em>(emphasis in original) (internal quotation marks omitted).</p>\n<p id=\"b684-7\">The defendant later filed a petition to vacate her conviction \u201con the ground that her counsel provided ineffective assistance by failing to adequately advise her regarding the immigration consequences of her plea.\u201d <em>Id. </em>The defendant denied that her counsel had ever advised her that pleading guilty would cause her to be removed from the country. <em>See id. </em>The defendant\u2019s counsel stated that he spoke with the defendant about the potential immigration consequences of pleading guilty, explained that there was the potential to be deported, and advised that \u201cshe had a better chance with Immigration with a misdemeanor than a felony.\u201d <em>Id. at </em>785-86. The trial court denied the petition to vacate, and the defendant appealed. <em>See id. at </em>786.</p>\n<p id=\"b684-8\">On appeal, the Ninth Circuit held that the defendant\u2019s \u201ccounsel was required to advise [the defendant] that her conviction rendered her removal virtually certain, or words to that effect[,]\u201d explaining that, as in <em>Padilla, </em>\u201cthe immigration statute expressly identified the defendant\u2019s conviction as a ground for removal[,]\u201d and that her \u201cconviction of a removable offense rendered the defendant\u2019s] removal practically inevitable.\u201d <em>Rodriguez-Vega, </em>797 F.3d at 786 (citations and internal quotation marks omitted). The Ninth Circuit rejected various arguments in support of the contention that the defendant\u2019s counsel\u2019s performance was not constitutionally deficient. <em>See id. </em>at 786-87. For example, the Ninth Circuit stated that <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"695\">*695</page-number>the circumstance that the defendant may have \u201ctheoretically\u201d been able to avoid removal under certain statutes, such as the family member exception for first-time offenders, by receiving withholding of removal, or by qualifying for relief under the Convention Against Torture, did \u201cnot alter [the] conclusion that on the record ... [the defendant\u2019s] removal was virtually certain.\u201d <em>Id. </em>(footnote omitted). The Ninth Circuit also determined that the defendant\u2019s \u201ccounsel\u2019s statements made after [the defendant] had already pled guilty, that she faced a \u2018high likelihood\u2019 of removal, [failed to] satisfy his duty to accurately advise his client of the removal consequences of a plea <em>before </em>she entered into it.\u201d <em>Id. </em>at 787 (emphasis in original) (citations omitted). According to the Ninth Circuit, \u201chad [the defendant] been properly and timely advised, [the defendant] could have instructed her counsel to attempt to negotiate a plea that would not result in her removal.\u201d <em>Id. </em>(citations omitted). The Ninth Circuit concluded that, \u201c[b]e-cause the immigration consequences of [the defendant\u2019s] plea were clear and her removal was virtually certain, ... counsel\u2019s performance [was] constitutionally ineffective.\u201d <em>Id. </em>at 788 (citation omitted).</p>\n<p id=\"b685-5\">In <em>State v. Favela, </em>311 P.3d 1213, 1214 (N.M.Ct.App.2013), <em>aff'd, </em>343 P.3d 178 (N.M.2015), the Court of Appeals of New Mexico held that the defendant\u2019s counsel provided \u201cdeficient representation\u201d where the defendant\u2019s counsel stated at the plea proceeding that \u201cmore than likely [the defendant] will have a great consequence on his papers being taken away.\u201d (Ellipsis omitted). In <em>Favela, </em>311 P.3d at 1214, the defendant, a native of Mexico who became a legal permanent resident, pleaded guilty to four counts of aggravated battery with a deadly weapon and one count of driving under the influence. At the plea proceeding, the trial court asked the defendant\u2019s counsel whether there was \u201can immigration consequence\u201d in the case. <em>Id. </em>The defendant\u2019s counsel responded: \u201cThere will be. Defendant is here legal and everything, he has his paper documentation and everything, but more than likely he will have a great consequence on his papers being taken away.\u201d <em>Id. </em>(brackets and ellipsis omitted). Immediately thereafter, <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"696\">*696</page-number>the trial court addressed the defendant, stating: \u201cI want to be sure you understand, as your attorney said, that a conviction will have an effect on your immigration status and that effect would be deportation, which is now called removal, exclusion from the United States and denial of naturalization under the laws of the United States. Do you understand[?]\u201d <em>Id. </em>at 1214-15 (brackets omitted). In response, the defendant stated that he understood and that he still desired to plead guilty. <em>See id. </em>at 1215. The trial court accepted the defendant\u2019s guilty plea. <em>See id. </em>Later, the defendant filed a motion for relief or, alternatively, a petition for a writ of habeas corpus, which the trial court summarily denied. <em>See id. </em>The defendant filed a motion for reconsideration, and the trial court conducted a hearing, after which the trial court denied the motion. <em>See id. </em>The defendant then appealed. <em>See id.</em></p>\n<p id=\"b686-5\">On appeal, the Court of Appeals of New Mexico explained that, in a previous case, the Supreme Court of New Mexico had \u201cclearly articulated what constitute^] effective assistance of counsel with respect to advising a criminal defendant of the immigration consequences of his or her plea.\u201d <em>Id. </em>at 1218. Specifically, in <em>Favela, id., </em>the Court observed that, in <em>State v. Paredez, </em>136 N.M. 533, 101 P.3d 799, 805 (2004), the Supreme Court of New Mexico \u201cheld that \u2018criminal defense attorneys are obligated to determine the immigration status of their clients. If a client is a non-citizen, the attorney must advise that client of the specific immigration consequences of pleading guilty, including whether deportation would be virtually certain.\u2019 \u201d The Court further explained the holding of <em>Paredez </em>as follows:</p>\n<blockquote id=\"b686-6\">In so holding, our Supreme Court agreed with those jurisdictions that have held that an affirmative misrepresentation by counsel as to the deportation consequences of a guilty plea is objectively unreasonable and went one step further in concluding that an attorney\u2019s non-advice to an alien defendant on the immigration consequences of a guilty plea would also be deficient performance. According to our Supreme Court, advice that a defendant \u201ccould\u201d or \u201cmight\u201d be deported is also inadequate, as such advice is incomplete <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"697\">*697</page-number>and therefore inaccurate because stating that a person \u2018may\u2019 be subject to deportation implies there is some chance, potentially a good chance, that the person will not be deported. This Court has since interpreted <em>Paredez </em>as requiring a definite prediction as to the likelihood of deportation based on the crimes to which a defendant intends to plead and the crimes listed in federal law for which a defendant can be deported.</blockquote>\n<p id=\"b687-5\"><em>Favela, </em>311 P.3d at 1218 (citations, ellipsis, brackets, and some internal quotation marks omitted). The Court observed that, following <em>Paredez, </em>the Supreme Court decided <em>Padilla </em>and \u201csimilarly held that counsel must inform her client whether his plea carries a risk of deportation.\u201d <em>Favela, </em>311 P.3d at 1218 (citations and internal quotation marks omitted). The Court noted, however, that the holding in <em>Padilla, </em>although \u201csimilar in nature to <em>Paredez, </em>was not as broad on the issue of what constitutes deficient representation.\u201d <em>Favela, </em>311 P.3d at 1218. Because Paredez was broader and contained no limitation, as in <em>Padilla, </em>distinguishing between where \u201cthe deportation consequence is truly clear\u201d and where \u201cthe law is not succinct and straightforward[,]\u201d the Court held that it was bound by <em>Paredez. Favela, </em>311 P.3d at 1218 (citation omitted).</p>\n<p id=\"b687-6\">The Court further held that, given the holding in <em>Paredez, </em>\u201ca court\u2019s warning or advisement to a defendant regarding possible immigration consequences of accepting a plea is never, by itself, sufficient to cure the prejudice that results from ineffective assistance of counsel[.]\u201d <em>Favela, </em>311 P.3d at 1222. Indeed, the Court determined that, \u201c[b]ecause a defendant whose attorney has not advised him of the immigration consequences of his plea has likely not advocated for a plea aimed at avoiding automatic deportation, the trial court\u2019s advice to a defendant that he may or will be deported cannot cure counsel\u2019s deficient representation.\u201d <em>Id. </em>Applying New Mexico precedent, the Court ultimately remanded the case to the trial court for further proceedings, through which the trial court could \u201chear evidence and reconsider both prongs of [the <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"698\">*698</page-number>defendant's ineffective assistance of counsel claim.\u201d <em>Id. </em>at 1223.</p>\n<p id=\"b688-4\">By contrast, in <em>Chacon, </em>409 S.W.3d at 534, 532, the Court of Appeals of Missouri held that a defendant\u2019s counsel\u2019s performance was not deficient where the defendant\u2019s counsel advised the defendant that \u201cif he pled guilty to the charges, he would <em>very likely be deported </em>and wouldn\u2019t be able to come back\u201d and advised the defendant to seek advice from an immigration lawyer. (Emphasis in original) (internal quotation marks omitted). In <em>Chacon, id. </em>at 531, the defendant, a native of Mexico, was charged with possession of cocaine and forgery. At the plea hearing, although there was no discussion of the risk of deportation, the defendant confirmed, among other things, that he had discussed his case with his counsel and that he was happy with his counsel\u2019s representation. <em>See id. </em>at 532. The defendant later filed a motion, contending that he had received ineffective assistance of counsel because his counsel had failed to advise him that he would be deported if he pleaded guilty. <em>See id. </em>The trial court conducted an evidentiary hearing, at which the defendant\u2019s counsel testified that the defendant had asked him about the risk of deportation, and that he advised the defendant \u201cthat if he pled guilty to the charges, he would <em>very likely be deported </em>and wouldn\u2019t be able to come back\u201d and that the defendant should seek advice from an immigration lawyer. <em>Id. </em>(emphasis in original). The trial court denied the motion, and the defendant appealed. <em>See id. </em>at 532-33.</p>\n<p id=\"b688-5\">The Court of Appeals of Missouri first examined the defendant\u2019s convictions and the applicable immigration law, stating that the defendant\u2019s visa had expired. <em>See id. </em>at 534. According to the Court, the law was \u201cclear that, after pleading guilty to cocaine possession and forgery, [the defendant] was deport-able, meaning that deportation was virtually inevitable.\u201d <em>Id. </em>(citation and internal quotation marks omitted). The Court rejected the defendant\u2019s contention that, under <em>Padilla, </em>his counsel \u201cwas required to specifically inform him that he was subject to mandatory deportation.\u201d <em>Chacon, </em>409 S.W.3d at 536 (internal quotation marks omitted). Rather, the Court <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"699\">*699</page-number>explained that, under Padilla, \u201cwhen the deportation consequence is clear, as it was in <em>Padilla </em>and as it [was t]here, defense counsel has a[] clear duty to give correct advice.\u201d <em>Chacon, </em>409 S.W.3d at 537 (citation omitted). Applying that standard, the Court concluded that the defendant\u2019s \u201ccounsel satisfied the performance requirement set forth in <em>Padilla </em>\u201d by advising the defendant as he did. <em>Chacon, </em>409 S.W.3d at 537. The Court explained that <em>\u201cPadilla </em>does not require that counsel use specific words to communicate to a defendant the consequences of entering a guilty plea[,]\u201d but instead \u201crequires that counsel <em>correctly </em>advise his client of the <em>risk </em>of deportation so that the plea is knowing and voluntary.\u201d <em>Chacon, </em>409 S.W.3d at 537 (emphasis in original). Thus, by advising the defendant that deportation was \u201cvery likely,\u201d the defendant\u2019s counsel adequately advised the defendant of the risk of deportation. <em>Id.</em></p>\n<p id=\"b689-5\">Similarly, in <em>Shata, </em>868 N.W.2d at 96, the Supreme Court of Wisconsin held that a defendant\u2019s counsel \u201cdid not perform deficiently\u201d where the defendant\u2019s counsel correctly advised the defendant \u201cthat his guilty plea carried a \u2018strong chance\u2019 of deportation.\u201d In <em>Shata, id., </em>the defendant, an Egyptian foreign national, was charged with one count of possession with intent to deliver marijuana, as party to a crime. At a plea hearing, the defendant\u2019s counsel informed the trial court that the defendant did not want to be deported; the parties then conducted an off-the-record discussion. <em>See id. </em>at 97. Before the trial court, the prosecutor presented the plea agreement, and the defendant\u2019s counsel stated that he had informed the defendant \u201cthat there\u2019s a potential he could be deported.\u201d <em>Id. </em>(internal quotation marks omitted). The defendant\u2019s counsel further stated: \u201cHe\u2019s not a United States citizen, [ ] there\u2019s a potential he could be deported.\u201d <em>Id. </em>The defendant stated that he understood and that he wished to plead guilty. <em>See id. </em>The trial court informed the defendant of the possible immigration consequences of pleading guilty, stating: \u201c[I]f you\u2019re not a citizen of the United States [] a plea of guilty or no contest for the offense with which you are charged may result in deportation, the exclusion from admission to this country, or <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"700\">*700</page-number>the denial of naturalization under federal law.\u201d <em>Id. </em>The defendant stated that he understood and proceeded to plead guilty. <em>See id. </em>at 97-98. The trial court thereafter observed that the defendant had signed a plea questionnaire and waiver of rights form that contained the same immigration warning that the trial court had given in court. <em>See id. </em>at 98. The trial court ascertained with both the defendant and the defendant\u2019s counsel that the two had discussed and gone over the forms. <em>See id. </em>The trial court then accepted the guilty plea. <em>See id.</em></p>\n<p id=\"b690-5\">Several months later, the defendant moved to withdraw the guilty plea, arguing that his counsel should have advised him that he was subject to mandatory deportation. <em>See id. </em>at 99. At a hearing on the motion, the defendant\u2019s counsel testified that he had informed the defendant \u201cof the potential for deportation if convicted[,]\u201d but had not told the defendant that deportation was mandatory. <em>See id. </em>The defendant\u2019s counsel also testified that, prior to the guilty plea, he had advised the defendant \u201cthat he may be deported, that there\u2019s a strong chance that he could be deported.\u201d <em>Id. </em>at 99-100 (ellipsis and internal quotation marks omitted). By contrast, the defendant testified that he would not have pleaded guilty had he known that he would be subject to mandatory deportation, and testified that his counsel had told him: \u201c[I]f you get probation, you\u2019re not going to be deported.\u201d <em>Id. </em>at 100 (internal quotation marks omitted). The trial court ultimately found the defendant\u2019s counsel \u201cmore credible and that counsel had informed [the defendant] of a strong likelihood of deportation if convicted\u201d; accordingly, the trial court found that the defendant\u2019s counsel had not performed deficiently, and that the defendant had not received ineffective assistance of counsel. <em>Id. </em>The trial court denied the motion to withdraw the guilty plea; the defendant appealed; the intermediate appellate court reversed the trial court\u2019s judgment; and the State of Wisconsin petitioned for review. <em>See id. </em>at 101.</p>\n<p id=\"b690-6\">At the outset, the Supreme Court of Wisconsin held that the defendant had not received ineffective assistance of counsel, explaining:</p>\n<blockquote id=\"b691-4\"><page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"701\">*701</page-number>[The defendant\u2019s attorney did not perform deficiently.

[The defendant\u2019s attorney was <em>not </em>required to tell him that his guilty plea would absolutely result in deportation.

To that end, the Court observed that, in <em>Padilla, </em>559 U.S. at 369, 130 S.Ct. 1473 the Supreme Court stated that \u201cwhen the deportation consequence is truly clear, ... the duty to give <em>correct advice </em>is equally clear.\u201d <em>Shata, </em>868 N.W.2d at 108 (ellipsis and emphasis in original).</p>\n<p id=\"b691-6\">As to whether the defendant\u2019s counsel had given the defendant correct advice, in <em>Shata, id. </em>at 108-09, the Court explained in detail why \u201cdeportation is not an absolutely certain consequence of a conviction for a deportable offense,\u201d stating:</p>\n<blockquote id=\"AeS\">[W]hether immigration personnel would necessarily take all the steps needed to institute and carry out an alien\u2019s actual deportation is not an absolute certainty[.] For example, prosecutorial discretion and the current administration\u2019s immigration policies provide possible avenues for deportable aliens to avoid deportation. In fact, the executive branch has essentially unreviewable prosecutorial discretion with <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"702\">*702</page-number>respect to commencing deportation proceedings, adjudicating cases, and executing removal orders.</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b692-4\">Indeed, the secretary of the United States Department of Homeland Security (\u201cDHS\u201d) recently explained that the DHS, which is responsible for enforcing the nation\u2019s immigration laws, must exercise prosecutorial discretion in the enforcement of the law. Due to limited resources, DHS cannot respond to all immigration violations or remove all persons illegally in the United States. DHS may exercise prosecutorial discretion at any stage of an enforcement proceeding. In the immigration context, prosecutorial discretion should apply not only to the decision to issue, serve, file, or cancel a Notice to Appear, but also to a broad range of other discretionary enforcement decisions, including deciding whether to settle or dismiss a case and whether to grant deferred action or a stay of removal!.] Deportation is not mandatory for a felony conviction. Rather, certain aliens, including those convicted of a felony, are generally prioritized for removal unless, based on the totality of the circumstances, the alien should not be an enforcement priority. Relevant factors include an alien\u2019s length of time in the United States and family or community ties in the United States. Because deportation is not an absolutely certain consequence of a conviction for a deportable offense, <em>Padilla </em>does not require an attorney to advise an alien client that deportation is an absolute certainty upon conviction of a deportable offense, including a controlled substance offense.</blockquote>\n<p id=\"b692-5\">(Bolding added) (citations, brackets, ellipses, footnotes, italics, and most internal quotation marks omitted). As the Court further explained, in <em>Padilla, </em>the Supreme Court \u201cnever stated that Padilla would absolutely be deported!,]\u201d but rather, the context made clear that the Supreme \u201cCourt meant that Padilla clearly was deportable under that immigration statute, not that he clearly would be deported.\u201d <em>Shata, </em>868 N.W.2d at 109 (citations omitted). According to the Supreme Court of Wisconsin, in <em>Padilla, </em>the Supreme Court simply held that counsel must advise his or her client that his or her plea <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"703\">*703</page-number>carries a risk of deportation, but \u201cdid not hold that an attorney must inform an alien client that a conviction for a deportable offense will absolutely result in deportation\u201d and \u201cdid not require an attorney [to] use any particular words, such as \u2018inevitable deportation,\u2019 or to even convey the idea of inevitable deportation.\u201d <em>Shata, </em>868 N.W.2d at 110 (citations and emphasis omitted).</p>\n<p id=\"b693-5\">After thoroughly reviewing the Supreme Court\u2019s holding in <em>Padilla, </em>in <em>Shata, </em>868 N.W.2d at 112-13, the Supreme Court of Wisconsin rejected the defendant\u2019s contention that counsel needed to have advised him that he would absolutely be deported if convicted, explaining:</p>\n<blockquote id=\"b693-6\">[The defendant\u2019s position \u2014 that his attorney was required to tell him that \u201chis conviction would absolutely result in deportation\u201d \u2014 is unworkable and untenable. That advice would be incorrect because a defense attorney does not control and cannot know with certainty whether the federal government will deport an alien upon conviction. If we were to adopt [the defendant\u2019s position, the unintended consequence may be that an alien defendant could be essentially precluded from ever pleading guilty or no contest to a crime. Why would the State make a plea bargain offer to such a defendant knowing that it could almost always be withdrawn? If we adopted [the defendant\u2019s position, then an alien might not ever be able to knowingly, intelligently, and voluntarily plead or even decide to proceed to trial. <em>Padilla </em>requires advice to be correct and, unlike in <em>Padilla, </em>the advice that [the defendant] received was actually correct. [The defendant\u2019s arguments fail because the advice that he received \u2014 that there was a \u201cstrong chance\u201d of deportation \u2014 was correct and accurate and he entered a knowing, intelligent, and voluntary plea with that understanding.</blockquote>\n<p id=\"b693-7\">The Court concluded that, under the circumstances of the case, the defendant\u2019s counsel did not perform deficiently in advising the defendant about the risk of deportation because that advice was correct. <em>See id. </em>at 114.</p>\n<p id=\"b694-4\"><page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"704\">*704</page-number>In <em>Commonwealth v.

To be sure, Sanmart\u00edn Prado did not enter, and was not convicted based on, a guilty plea, a conditional plea of guilty, or a plea of nolo contendere, as was the circumstance in <em>Padilla, Denisyuk, </em>and the other cases discussed above. Rather, Sanmart\u00edn Prado entered into a plea agreement under which he would proceed by way of a not guilty agreed statement of facts on the charge of second-degree child abuse, and, \u201c[u]pon a finding of guilt,\u201d the State would recommend a sentence of ten years\u2019 imprisonment with all but one year suspended, and the State would nol pros the remaining <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"709\">*709</page-number>charges for first-degree child abuse causing severe physical injury and second-degree assault. The State\u2019s recitation of the plea agreement made it clear that both parties expected that Sanmart\u00edn Prado would be convicted of second-degree child abuse based on the agreed statement of facts. During the waiver colloquy conducted by trial counsel, trial counsel explained that, by proceeding with a not guilty agreed statement of facts, Sanmart\u00edn Prado would be waiving his right to a jury trial as well as his right to \u201ca Court trial or a bench trial[,]\u201d \u201ca formal contested trial in front of a judge.\u201d Sanmart\u00edn Prado affirmatively responded that he understood. Sanmart\u00edn Prado also affirmatively responded that he understood that he was waiving his right for trial counsel \u201cto present a formal defense[.]\u201d Sanmart\u00edn Prado did not reserve the right to appeal any matter associated with the not guilty agreed statement of facts plea. Nor did the not guilty agreed statement of facts suggest the existence of any factual or legal issues that were to be resolved by the circuit court. Under these circumstances, where a conviction was almost a certainty given the State\u2019s recitation of the plea agreement and the waiver colloquy that followed, we conclude that Sanmart\u00edn Prado\u2019s plea of not guilty by way of an agreed statement of facts was the functional equivalent of a guilty plea; and, as such, the standards for advisement of immigration consequences during a guilty plea are applicable.</p>\n<p id=\"b699-5\">Having concluded as much, we now turn to whether trial counsel\u2019s advisement about the immigration consequences was constitutionally deficient because trial counsel \u201cqualified\u201d his advice, or whether the advice was correct advice that adequately informed Sanmart\u00edn Prado of the risk of deportation. We begin by closely examining the Supreme Court\u2019s holding in <em>Padilla. </em>As discussed above, in <em>Padilla, </em>559 U.S. at 374, 130 S.Ct. 1473 at bottom, the Supreme Court simply held \u201cthat counsel must inform [his or] her client whether his [or her] plea carries a risk of deportation.\u201d As to that holding, the Supreme Court instructed that, where \u201cthe deportation consequences of a particular plea are unclear or uncertain!,]\u201d \u201ca criminal defense attorney need do no more than <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"710\">*710</page-number>advise a noncitizen client that pending criminal charges may carry a risk of adverse immigration consequences.\u201d <em>Id. </em>at 369, 130 S.Ct. 1473 (footnote omitted). On the other hand, where \u201cthe deportation consequence is truly clear, ... the duty to give correct advice is equally clear.\u201d <em>Id.</em></p>\n<p id=\"b700-5\">Significantly, in <em>Padilla, id. </em>at 368-69, 130 S.Ct. 1473 in considering the immigration consequences of Padilla\u2019s guilty plea in light of the relevant immigration statute, the Supreme Court never stated that Padilla would absolutely be deported or that deportation would occur with certainty. Rather, the Supreme Court stated that \u201cthe terms of the relevant immigration statute are succinct, clear, and explicit in defining the removal consequence for Padilla\u2019s conviction!,]\u201d and that Padilla\u2019s \u201cplea would make him eligible for deportation!.]\u201d <em>Id. </em>at 368, 130 S.Ct. 1473. The Supreme Court also determined that \u201c[t]he consequences of Padilla\u2019s plea could easily be determined from reading the removal statute!,]\u201d and that Padilla\u2019s \u201cdeportation was presumptively mandatory!.]\u201d <em>Id. </em>at 369, 130 S.Ct. 1473. When read in context, these remarks by the Supreme Court make clear that, in light of the relevant immigration statute \u2014 which provided that an alien convicted of a violation of any law related to a controlled substance other than a single offense involving possession for one\u2019s own use of thirty grams or less of marijuana is \u201cdeportable\u201d \u2014 Padilla\u2019s conviction made him \u201cdeportable,\u201d nothing more and nothing less. Indeed, in <em>Padilla, </em>the Supreme Court did not state or require that defense counsel advise a noncitizen client \u201cthat deportation is an absolute certainty upon conviction of a deportable offense, including a controlled substance offense.\u201d <em>Shata, </em>868 N.W.2d at 109 (citing <em>Escobar, </em>70 A.3d at 841-42). Rather, defense counsel must advise of the risk of deportation and provide correct advice where the deportation consequence is clear. <em>See Padilla, </em>559 U.S. at 374, 369, 130 S.Ct. 1473.</p>\n<p id=\"b700-6\">To be sure, in <em>Padilla, id. </em>at 360, 130 S.Ct. 1473 the Supreme Court stated: \u201cWe agree with Padilla that constitutionally competent counsel would have advised him that his conviction for drug distribution made him subject to automatic deportation.\u201d (Emphasis added). However, we agree <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"711\">*711</page-number>with the Supreme Court of Wisconsin that, by stating that Padilla was \u201csubject to automatic deportation,\u201d \u201cthe [Supreme] Court meant that Padilla was automatically deportable upon conviction, not that he would be automatically deported.\u201d <em>Shata, </em>868 N.W.2d at 109-10. Indeed, in <em>Padilla, </em>559 U.S. at 363-64, 130 S.Ct. 1473 the Supreme Court explained that, although immigration law has undergone significant changes over the past decades and \u201cif a noncitizen has committed a removable offense after the 1996 effective date of the[ ] amendments, his [or her] removal is practically inevitable[,]\u201d there still exists \u201cthe possible exercise of limited remnants of equitable discretion vested in the Attorney General to cancel removal for noncitizens convicted of particular classes of offenses.\u201d (Footnote omitted). In other words, being \u201csubject to automatic deportation\u201d is not the equivalent of being automatically deported, because deportation is not an absolute certainty even if one is subject to automatic deportation. Moreover, in <em>Shata, </em>868 N.W.2d at 110, the Supreme Court of Wisconsin aptly explained:</p>\n<blockquote id=\"b701-5\">The <em>Padilla </em>Court did not require that counsel advise that the [Department of Homeland Security] would necessarily initiate and prosecute a removal proceeding against Padilla and enforce a removal order against him because that was far from certain. Rather, the [Supreme] Court\u2019s \u201coverall emphasis was that the deportation statute in question makes most drug convicts subject to deportation in the sense that they certainly become deportable, not in the sense that plea counsel should know and state with certainty that the federal government will, in fact, initiate deportation proceedings.\u201d</blockquote>\n<p id=\"b701-6\">(Quoting <em>Escobar, </em>70 A.3d at 842).</p>\n<p id=\"b701-7\">In short, nothing in the Supreme Court\u2019s holding in <em>Padilla </em>requires defense counsel to inform noncitizens that a conviction for a deportable offense will absolutely or with certainty result in the Federal government, <em>i.e., </em>the Department of Homeland Security, initiating deportation proceedings. The Supreme Court did not discuss, let alone hold, that defense counsel must use specific magic words in advising of the risk <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"712\">*712</page-number>of deportation, such as \u201cabsolute deportation,\u201d \u201ccertain deportation,\u201d or \u201cinevitable deportation\u201d or the like. As the Court of Appeals of Missouri remarked: <em>\u201cPadilla </em>does not require that counsel use specific words to communicate to a defendant the consequences of entering a guilty plea. Rather, it requires that counsel <em>correctly </em>advise his [or her] client of the <em>risk </em>of deportation so that the plea is knowing and voluntary.\u201d <em>Chacon, </em>409 S.W.3d at 538 (emphasis in original). Nor did the Supreme Court hold that defense counsel must become experts in immigration law to provide representation to a noncitizen client at a guilty plea proceeding. The Supreme Court expressly recognized that \u201c[i]mmigration law can be complex, and it is a legal specialty of its own. Some members of the bar who represent clients facing criminal charges, in either state or federal court or both, may not be well versed in it.\u201d <em>Padilla, </em>559 U.S. at 369, 130 S.Ct. 1473. Stated otherwise, the Supreme Court apparently acknowledged that the intricacies of immigration law are not necessarily something with which defense counsel are familiar or skilled. And, to that end, rather than holding that defense counsel must become experts in immigration law for purposes of advising noncitizen clients of the risks of deportation, in <em>Padilla, id. </em>at 366, 130 S.Ct. 1473 the Supreme Court essentially extended the principle of <em>Strickland </em>that \u201c[t]he proper measure of attorney performance remains simply reasonableness under prevailing professional norms.\u201d (Quoting <em>Strickland, </em>466 U.S. at 688, 104 S.Ct. 2052). According to the Supreme Court, \u201c[t]he weight of prevailing professional norms supports the view that counsel must advise [his or] her client regarding the risk of deportation.\u201d <em>Padilla, </em>559 U.S. at 367, 130 S.Ct. 1473 (citations omitted). Notably, in <em>Padilla, </em>the Supreme Court did not conclude that \u201cprevailing professional norms\u201d require defense counsel to inform noncitizen clients that convictions for deport-able offenses will absolutely or with certainty lead to deportation. Instead, the Supreme Court stated that \u201c[i]t is quintessentially the duty of counsel to provide [his or] her client with available advice about an issue like deportation and the failure to do so clearly satisfied the first prong of the <em>Strickland </em><page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"713\">*713</page-number>analysis.\u201d <em>Id. </em>at 371, 130 S.Ct. 1473 (citation and internal quotation marks omitted).</p>\n<p id=\"b703-5\">And, lest we forget to mention it, the Supreme Court decided <em>Padilla, </em>559 U.S. at 359, 130 S.Ct. 1473 against the backdrop, and in the context, of affirmative misadvice having been given. Padilla\u2019s counsel provided incorrect, erroneous advice by advising that Padilla \u201cdid not have to worry about immigration status since he had been in the country so long.\u201d <em>Id. </em>As the Supreme Court explained, \u201cPadilla\u2019s counsel provided him false assurance that his conviction would not result in his removal from this country.\u201d <em>Id. </em>at 368, 130 S.Ct. 1473. Thus, it was \u201cnot a hard case in which to find deficiency: The consequences of Padilla\u2019s plea could easily be determined from reading the removal statute, his deportation was presumptively mandatory, and his counsel\u2019s advice was incorrect.\u201d <em>Id. </em>at 368-69, 130 S.Ct. 1473.</p>\n<p id=\"b703-6\">By contrast, in this case, trial counsel provided correct immigration advice to Sanmart\u00edn Prado. The circuit court expressly credited trial counsel\u2019s testimony at the coram nobis hearing, that trial counsel met with Sanmart\u00edn Prado and explained the immigration consequences of a conviction, including that the offense was a \u201cdeportable offense,\u201d that Sanmart\u00edn Prado \u201ccould be deported ... if the federal government chose to initiate deportation proceedings,\u201d and thus that it was \u201cpossible\u201d that Sanmart\u00edn Prado would be deported. This advice \u2014 that second-degree child abuse is a deportable offense \u2014 was correct advice. <em>See </em>8 U.S.C. \u00a7 1227(a)(2)(E)\u00ae (\u201cAny alien who at any time after admission is convicted of a crime of ... child abuse ... is deportable.\u201d).<footnotemark>11</footnotemark> Thus, by advising Sanmart\u00edn Prado that the offense of second-degree child abuse was a deportable offense, trial counsel provided \u201ccorrect advice\u201d about the \u201crisk of deportation[,]\u201d as required <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"714\">*714</page-number>by <em>Padilla, </em>559 U.S. at 369, 374, 130 S.Ct. 1473. Nothing more was required of trial counsel under <em>Padilla </em>and his performance was not constitutionally deficient. In our view, although the Supreme Court has not addressed the situation in which defense counsel advised a noncitizen defendant that an offense is \u201cdeportable\u201d and that the defendant could be deported if the Federal government chose to initiate deportation proceedings, trial counsel\u2019s advice in this case fully complied with the Supreme Court\u2019s holding in <em>Padilla.</em></p>\n<p id=\"b704-5\">Significantly, trial counsel\u2019s performance in this case is readily distinguishable from those cases in which a defendant\u2019s counsel\u2019s performance was constitutionally deficient due to a failure to advise the defendant whatsoever of the immigration consequences of the defendant\u2019s plea or affirmatively misadvising the defendant about the immigration consequences of the defendant\u2019s plea. <em>See, e.g., Denisyuk, </em>422 Md. at 482, 30 A.3d at 925 (The defendant\u2019s counsel \u201cwas obligated, but failed, to provide advice on the deportation consequences of [the defendant\u2019s plea, [and the defendant\u2019s trial counsel\u2019s performance was constitutionally deficient\u201d where the defendant\u2019s counsel failed to advise the defendant of the immigration consequences of the plea altogether.); <em>Bonilla, </em>637 F.3d at 984 (The defendant \u201creceived \u2018inadequate legal advice\u2019 about the immigration consequences of his plea\u201d because he \u201creceived <em>no </em>advice about the immigration consequences before entering his plea, only learning afterward that pleading guilty would almost certainly result in deportation.\u201d (Emphasis in original) (citations omitted)); <em>Akinsade, </em>686 F.3d at 250 (The defendant\u2019s counsel\u2019s performance was constitutionally deficient where he \u201cmisadvised [the defendant] that he could not be deported based on th[e] single offense\u201d and \u201cthat he could only be deported if he had two felony convictions.\u201d). Additionally, this case is distinguishable from <em>Rodriguez-Vega, </em>797 F.3d at 787, in which the Ninth Circuit concluded that \u201ccounsel\u2019s statements made after [the defendant] had already pled guilty, that she faced a \u2018high likelihood\u2019 of removal, [do not] satisfy his duty to accurately advise his client of the removal consequences of a plea <em>before </em>she enters into it.\u201d <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"715\">*715</page-number>(Emphasis in original) (citations omitted). By contrast, in this case, the circuit court expressly found as a fact that, prior to the January 6, 2011 proceeding, trial counsel met with Sanmart\u00edn Prado at the detention center and \u201cexplained the immigration consequences of a guilty verdict, including that this was a \u2018deportable offense\u2019 and [Sanmart\u00edn Prado] \u2018could be deported ... if the federal government chose to initiate deportation proceedings,\u2019 and it was \u2018possible\u2019 that [Sanmart\u00edn Prado] would be deported.\u201d In other words, unlike in <em>Rodriguez-Vega, </em>in this case, trial counsel advised Sanmart\u00edn Prado before the plea of not guilty by way of an agreed statement of facts.</p>\n<p id=\"b705-5\">This case is also distinguishable from <em>Favela, </em>311 P.3d at 1218, where New Mexico case law has developed to require that \u201ccriminal defense attorneys are obligated to determine the immigration status of their clients. If a client is a non-citizen, the attorney must advise that client of the specific immigration consequences of pleading guilty, including whether deportation would be virtually certain.\u201d (Citing <em>Paredez, </em>101 P.3d at 805). Indeed, New Mexico case law requires \u201ca definite prediction as to the likelihood of deportation based on the crimes to which a defendant intends to plead and the crimes listed in federal law for which a defendant can be deported.\u201d <em>Id. </em>(citation and internal quotation marks omitted). In <em>Favela, </em>311 P.3d at 1218, the Court of Appeals of New Mexico expressly recognized that <em>Padilla </em>\u201cwas not as broad on the issue of what constitutes deficient representation\u201d in New Mexico, and that, in general, the New Mexico standard was a higher standard than that in <em>Padilla. </em>For example, in New Mexico, an advisement \u201cthat a defendant \u2018could\u2019 or \u2018might\u2019 be deported is [ ] inadequate[.]\u201d <em>Favela, </em>311 P.3d at 1218 (citation omitted). By contrast, in Maryland, neither this Court nor the Court of Special Appeals has held that a defendant\u2019s counsel must advise of the \u201cspecific immigration consequences\u201d attendant to a guilty plea, or that a defendant\u2019s counsel must advise \u201cwhether deportation would be virtually certain.\u201d <em>Id. </em>In other words, Maryland courts (with the exception of the Court of Special Appeals in this <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"716\">*716</page-number>case) have not required advisements above and beyond what <em>Padilla, </em>559 U.S. at 374, 369, 130 S.Ct. 1473 requires \u2014 that a defendant\u2019s counsel advise his or her client whether a plea \u201ccarries a risk of deportation\u201d and that such advice be \u201ccorrect advice\u201d where \u201cthe deportation consequence is truly clear\u201d based on the relevant immigration law.</p>\n<p id=\"b706-5\">Rather, we conclude that the holdings of <em>Chacon, Shata, </em>and <em>Escobar </em>are more persuasive and analogous to the circumstances of this case. In each of those cases, the courts held that the defendants\u2019 counsel advisements about the risk of deportation, even with the use of qualifying words, where such advice was correct advice, satisfied the dictates of <em>Padilla </em>and were not constitutionally deficient. <em>See Chacon, </em>409 S.W.3d at 534, 532 (The defendant\u2019s counsel\u2019s performance was not deficient where the defendant\u2019s counsel the defendant that \u201cif he pled guilty to the charges, he would <em>very likely be deported </em>and wouldn\u2019t be able to come back\u201d and advised the defendant to seek advice from an immigration lawyer. (Emphasis in original) (internal quotation marks omitted)); <em>Shata, </em>868 N.W.2d at 96 (The defendant\u2019s counsel \u201cdid not perform deficiently\u201d where the defendant\u2019s counsel correctly advised the defendant that \u201chis guilty plea carried a \u2018strong chance\u2019 of deportation.\u201d); <em>Escobar, </em>70 A.3d at 841 (The defendant\u2019s counsel did not provide deficient representation where he gave correct advice about the immigration consequences of the plea, including that \u201cthere was a substantial risk of deportation\u201d and that \u201cit was likely there would be deportation proceedings instituted against [the defendant.]\u201d). Moreover, in each of those cases, the courts recognized that a conviction for a deportable offense will not necessarily result in deportation, and that a defendant\u2019s counsel is not required to advise as much. <em>See Chacon, </em>409 S.W.3d at 536-37 (\u201c[The defendant] argues that, under <em>Padilla, </em>his attorney was required to specifically inform him that he was subject to \u2018mandatory deportation.\u2019 We disagreed] ... [The defendant]^ convictions made his deportation presumptively mandatory, and the motion court could properly find that advice that he \u2018would very likely be deported and wouldn\u2019t be able to come back,\u2019 <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"717\">*717</page-number>did not fall below what is required of a reasonably competent attorney under the circumstances.\u201d); <em>Shata, </em>868 N.W.2d at 114 (\u201cWe withdraw any language in [a prior case] that suggests that <em>Padilla </em>requires an attorney to advise an alien client that a conviction for a deportable offense will necessarily result in deportation.\u201d); <em>Escobar, </em>70 A.3d at 842 (\u201cWe do not read the statute or the court\u2019s words [in <em>Padilla </em>] as announcing a guarantee that actual deportation proceedings are a certainty such that counsel must advise a defendant to that effect.\u201d). Ultimately, as in <em>Chacon, Shata, </em>and <em>Escobar, </em>in this case, Sanmart\u00edn Prado received similar and correct advice, namely, that \u201cthere could and probably would be immigration consequences as a result of the plea[,]\u201d that the offense \u201cwas a deportable or a possibly deportable offensef,]\u201d and that Sanmart\u00edn Prado \u201ccould be deported ... if the federal government chose to initiate deportation proceedings[.]\u201d</p>\n<p id=\"b707-5\">As discussed, trial counsel\u2019s advice in this case was correct advice concerning the risk of deportation that Sanmart\u00edn Prado faced if convicted of second-degree child abuse. Trial counsel fully complied with the dictates of <em>Padilla </em>by advising Sanmart\u00edn Prado, prior to the January 6, 2011 proceeding, that \u201cthis was a \u2018deportable offense\u2019 and [Sanmart\u00edn Prado] \u2018could be deported ... if the federal government chose to initiate deportation proceedings,\u2019 and it was \u2018possible\u2019 that [Sanmart\u00edn Prado] would be deported.\u201d Trial counsel did not fail to advise Sanmart\u00edn Prado altogether about the risk of deportation nor did trial counsel provide misadvice or false assurances along the lines of \u201cyou will not be deported\u201d; <em>i.e., </em>trial counsel in this case avoided providing no or incorrect advice. To be certain, advising Sanmart\u00edn Prado that the offense was \u201cdeportable\u201d is not the equivalent of advising him that he will be automatically deported. But, as discussed above, <em>Padilla </em>does not require the use of specific magic words when advising a client of the risk of deportation, provided such advice is correct advice, nor does <em>Padilla </em>require that defense counsel advise a noncitizen client that a conviction for a deportable offense will absolutely, with cer<page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"718\">*718</page-number>tainty, or automatically, result in deportation. Importantly, the applicable immigration statute, 8 U.S.C. \u00a7 1227, does not state that the offenses are \u201cautomatically deportable\u201d or that a noncitizen shall be \u201cautomatically deported\u201d; rather, the statute provides that convictions for the offenses render noncitizens \u201cdeportable.\u201d Thus, contrary to Sanmart\u00edn Prado\u2019s contention, neither <em>Padilla </em>nor the statute requires that trial counsel advise that deportation was automatic or mandatory. And, in any event, that an offense is \u201cdeportable\u201d does not mean that deportation is an absolute certainty.</p>\n<p id=\"b708-4\">As discussed above, in <em>Shata, </em>868 N.W.2d at 108-09, the Supreme Court of Wisconsin explained why \u201cdeportation is not an absolutely certain consequence of a conviction for a deportable offense,\u201d stating:</p>\n<blockquote id=\"b708-5\">[Wjhether immigration personnel would necessarily take all the steps needed to institute and carry out an alien\u2019s actual deportation is not an absolute certainty[.] For example, prosecutorial discretion and the current administration\u2019s immigration policies provide possible avenues for deportable aliens to avoid deportation. In fact, the executive branch has essentially unreviewable prosecutorial discretion with respect to commencing deportation proceedings, adjudicating cases, and executing removal orders.</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b708-6\">Indeed, the secretary of the United States Department of Homeland Security (\u201cDHS\u201d) recently explained that the DHS, which is responsible for enforcing the nation\u2019s immigration laws, must exercise prosecutorial discretion in the enforcement of the law. Due to limited resources, DHS cannot respond to all immigration violations or remove all persons illegally in the United States. DHS may exercise prosecutorial discretion at any stage of an enforcement proceeding. In the immigration context, prosecutorial discretion should apply not only to the decision to issue, serve, file, or cancel a Notice to Appear, but also to a broad range of other discretionary enforcement decisions, including deciding whether to settle or dismiss a case and whether to grant deferred action or a stay of removal[.] Deportation is not mandatory for a felony conviction. Rather, certain <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"719\">*719</page-number>aliens, including those convicted of a felony, are generally prioritized for removal unless, based on the totality of the circumstances, the alien should not be an enforcement priority. Relevant factors include an alien\u2019s length of time in the United States and family or community ties in the United States. Because deportation is not an absolutely certain consequence of a conviction for a deportable offense, <em>Padilla </em>does not require an attorney to advise an alien client that deportation is an absolute certainty upon conviction of a deportable offense, including a controlled substance offense.</blockquote>\n<p id=\"b709-5\">(Emphasis added) (citations, brackets, ellipses, footnotes, and most internal quotation marks omitted). Indeed, the process that must occur between a defendant\u2019s conviction for a deport-able offense and actual deportation makes it less than certain or absolute that deportation will actually result even if the defendant is convicted of a deportable offense.</p>\n<p id=\"b709-6\">Aside from the circumstance that deportation is not an absolute certainty upon conviction of a deportable offense, from a practical standpoint, it would be unreasonable to require defense counsel, without qualification, to advise noncitizen clients about the risk of deportation such that defense counsel is placed in the position of having to provide detailed and specific information about the risk of deportation and to essentially become an immigration law specialist. Even in <em>Padilla, </em>559 U.S. at 369, 130 S.Ct. 1473 the Supreme Court recognized that immigration law is a \u201ccomplex\u201d area of law and that there will \u201cundoubtedly be numerous situations in which the deportation consequences of a particular plea are unclear or uncertain.\u201d Requiring defense counsel, who \u201cmay not be well versed in\u201d immigration law, <em>id., </em>to become legal experts concerning immigration law places too high a burden on defense counsel, one that surely exceeds the \u201cprevailing professional norms[,]\u201d <em>id. </em>at 367, 130 S.Ct. 1473. Moreover, it may not always be easy to tell whether a particular immigration statute is succinct, clear, and explicit. Indeed, even for those who are trained in immigration law, it may be difficult to ascertain whether a particular crime would be considered as a <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"720\">*720</page-number>crime involving moral turpitude or as an aggravated felony. In short, it is unreasonable to require that defense counsel investigate and determine that the Federal government will, with certainty, actually deport a particular noncitizen defendant upon conviction of a deportable offense.</p>\n<p id=\"b710-5\">As to Maryland Rule 4 \u2014 242(f)(1), we conclude that trial counsel\u2019s advice fully complied with the Rule.<footnotemark>12</footnotemark> Maryland Rule 4 \u2014 242(f)(1) provides:</p>\n<blockquote id=\"b710-6\">Before the court accepts a plea of guilty, a conditional plea of guilty, or a plea of nolo contendere, the court, the State\u2019s Attorney, the attorney for the defendant, or any combination thereof shall advise the defendant [ ] that by entering the plea, if the defendant is not a United States citizen, the defendant may face additional consequences of deportation, detention, or ineligibility for citizenship[.]</blockquote>\n<p id=\"AgdR\">(Emphasis added). Here, trial counsel\u2019s advice fully comported with Maryland Rule 4 \u2014 242(f)(1), and indeed, by including the advisement that the offense of conviction was a deportable offense and that Sanmart\u00edn Prado could be deported if the Federal government chose to proceed, exceeded the requirements of the Rule. Maryland Rule 4 \u2014 242(f)(1) requires only that a defendant be advised that as a result of a guilty plea, the defendant may face additional consequences of deportation, detention, or ineligibility for citizenship. Maryland Rule 4-242(f)(l) does not require that any specific advice be given regarding the probability or certainty of deportation or that any specific information be given regarding any immigration law that may be applicable to a particular defendant\u2019s case. In sum, Maryland Rule 4-242(f)(l) requires only that a noncitizen defendant be alerted that he or she may face immigration consequences. The coram nobis court\u2019s findings support the conclusion that trial counsel complied with Maryland Rule 4-<page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"721\">*721</page-number>242(f)(1). The coram nobis court specifically found that trial counsel advised Sanmart\u00edn Prado that the offense of conviction was a deportable offense and that he could be deported. Additionally, the record reflects that at the January 6, 2011 proceeding, following a colloquy with. Sanmart\u00edn Prado concerning his immigration status, trial counsel stated: \u201cAnd you understand that Pm not making any promises and the Judge is not making any promises about what the federal government could possibly do in the future with respect to reviewing this conviction.\u201d Sanmart\u00edn Prado stated that he understood. Together, the advisements prior to the January 6, 2011 proceeding and during the proceeding, indicate that Sanmart\u00edn Prado was made aware that he \u201cmay face additional [immigration] consequences[.]\u201d In other words, trial counsel satisfied Maryland Rule 4-242(f)(l) in all its dictates.</p>\n<p id=\"b711-5\">As a related matter, we note that, by its plain language, contrary to Sanmart\u00edn Prado\u2019s assertion, Maryland Rule 4-242(f)(1) does not explicitly require that an advisement about additional immigration consequences must be made on the record at a plea proceeding. In distinct contrast, both Maryland Rule 4-242(c) (Plea of guilty) and Maryland Rule 4-242(e) (Plea of nolo contendere) expressly require that an \u201cexamination of the defendant on the record in open court conducted by the court, the State\u2019s Attorney, the attorney for the defendant, or any combination therefor\u201d occur so that the trial court can determine and announce on the record that the defendant is pleading voluntarily -with the understanding of the nature of the charge and the consequences of the plea. Each of those subsections further states that, \u201cbefore accepting the plea, the court shall comply -with section (f) of this Rule.\u201d Neither Maryland Rule 4-242(c) or (e) provide, however, that compliance with Maryland Rule 4-242(f) can only be achieved by an on-the-record examination.</p>\n<p id=\"b711-6\">In any event, in this case, trial counsel advised Sanmart\u00edn Prado of the immigration consequences for a conviction for second-degree child abuse both on and off the record in a manner that satisfied Maryland Rule 4 \u2014 242(f)(1). The record of the January 6, 2011 proceeding demonstrates that trial <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"722\">*722</page-number>counsel confirmed with Sanmart\u00edn Prado, on the record, that Sanmart\u00edn Prado was a legal permanent resident, <em>ie. </em>a noncitizen, and that the two had engaged in discussions about Sanmart\u00edn Prado\u2019s immigration status. Sanmart\u00edn Prado also confirmed that he understood that neither trial counsel nor the circuit court were making any promises concerning what the Federal government would do in the future, as to immigration consequences, if Sanmart\u00edn Prado were convicted. Again, following the coram nobis hearing, the circuit court found \u201cas a fact\u201d that trial counsel met with Sanmart\u00edn Prado at the detention center prior to the January 6, 2011 proceeding, and that, at that time, trial counsel \u201cexplained the immigration consequences of a guilty verdict, including that this was a \u2018deportable offense\u2019 and [Sanmart\u00edn Prado] \u2018could be deported ... if the federal government chose to initiate deportation proceedings^]\u2019 \u201d Under the circumstances of this case, we conclude that trial counsel\u2019s advisements satisfied Maryland Rule 4 \u2014 242(f)(1).</p>\n<p id=\"b712-5\">In sum, we hold that trial counsel did not perform in a constitutionally deficient manner in advising Sanmart\u00edn Prado as to the immigration consequences attendant to a conviction for second-degree child abuse in the manner in which he did. Sanmart\u00edn Prado has failed to satisfy the first prong of <em>Strickland, </em>which requires that a \u201cdefendant must show that counsel\u2019s performance was deficient.\u201d <em>Taylor, </em>428 Md. at 399, 51 A.3d at 662 (quoting <em>Strickland, </em>466 U.S. at 687, 104 S.Ct. 2052). Accordingly, Sanmart\u00edn Prado has not demonstrated that he received ineffective assistance of counsel.<footnotemark>13</footnotemark> As such, in the absence of constitutionally deficient performance by coun<em>sel </em>\u2014 ie., in the absence of ineffective assistance of counsel being rendered by trial counsel \u2014 we conclude that the circuit court correctly denied Sanmart\u00edn Prado\u2019s petition for coram nobis relief.</p>\n<p id=\"b713-4\"><page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"723\">*723</page-number>JUDGMENT OF THE COURT OF SPECIAL APPEALS REVERSED.

Additionally, the Committee note to Maryland Rule 4-242(a) states:</p>\n<blockquote id=\"AsW\">It has become common in some courts for defendants to enter a plea of not guilty but, in lieu of a normal trial, to proceed on an agreed statement of ultimate fact to be read into the record or on a statement <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"708\">*708</page-number>of proffered evidence to which the defendant stipulates, the purpose being to avoid the need for the formal presentation of evidence but to allow the defendant to argue the sufficiency of the agreed facts or evidence and to appeal from a judgment of conviction.
