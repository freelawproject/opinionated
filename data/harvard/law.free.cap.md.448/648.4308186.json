The Appellant seeks to collect benefits under the Maryland Workers\u2019 Compensation Act, Md. Code (1991, 2008 Repl. Vol.), \u00a7\u00a7 9-101-9-1201 of the Labor and Employment Article (\u201cLE\u201d) that would have been due to her father, Car-ville Hollingsworth (\u201cHollingsworth\u201d), had he not died of causes unrelated to the accidental injury he sustained in the course of his employment. Under LE \u00a7 9-632, an award of benefits by the Workers\u2019 Compensation Commission survives upon the death of an injured employee. On the other hand, under LE \u00a7 9-640, an award of benefits survives upon the death of an injured employee only up to $45,000.00. Appellant argues that LE \u00a7 9-632 applies and Appellees contend that LE \u00a7 9-640 governs. For the reasons set forth below, we agree with Appellees that LE \u00a7 9-640 controls.</p>\n<p id=\"b642-7\">FACTS AND LEGAL PROCEEDINGS</p>\n<p id=\"b642-8\">The facts of this case are undisputed. In 2010, Hollingsworth sustained an accidental injury in the course of his employment with Appellee. The body parts involved in the 2010 injury included Hollingsworth\u2019s neck, right shoulder, back, and right hand. In November 2013, the Commission issued an award of compensation after determining that, as <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"653\">*653</page-number>the result of the combined effects of the accidental injury and his preexisting conditions, Hollingsworth was permanently totally disabled. The Commission found that Hollingsworth had a 65% permanent disability due to the 2010 accidental injury. The Commission then found that the balance of his permanent disability, 35%, was due to his preexisting conditions, for which the Subsequent Injury Fund was responsible for paying compensation.</p>\n<p id=\"b643-4\">In accordance with these findings, the Commission directed the Appellees to pay Hollingsworth compensation at the rate of $798.00 weekly beginning February 7, 2013, not to exceed the sum of $345,534.00 allowable under the \u201cOther cases\u201d provision of the Maryland Workers\u2019 Compensation Act, LE \u00a7 9-627(k). The Commission also ordered the Subsequent Injury Fund to begin making payments to Hollingsworth at the end of the compensation to be paid by Appellees. The Commission ruled that these payments by the Fund would be made for as long as Hollingsworth continued to be permanently totally disabled.</p>\n<p id=\"b643-5\">Hollingsworth died in July 2014 from causes unrelated to the accidental injury. Up to the time of his death, Appellees made compensation payments pursuant to the Commission\u2019s award amounting to $52,166.54. Subsequently, the Appellant filed issues with the Commission seeking continued payment of the benefits provided in the November 2013 award.</p>\n<p id=\"b643-6\">Following an October 2014 hearing, the Commission issued an order in which it determined that Appellees were not obligated to make further payments under the award of compensation to Appellant because LE \u00a7 9-640 caps the survival of benefits at $45,000.00 and Appellees had already paid more than this amount to Hollingsworth at the time of his death.</p>\n<p id=\"b643-7\">Appellant petitioned for judicial review of the Commission\u2019s order to the Circuit Court for Baltimore County and both parties filed motions for summary judgment. The Circuit Court denied Appellant\u2019s, motion and granted Appellees\u2019 motion, thereby affirming the Commission\u2019s ruling. Appellant <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"654\">*654</page-number>then appealed the Circuit Court\u2019s decision to the Court of Special Appeals and filed a petition for writ of certiorari with this Court. Before the intermediate appellate court\u2019s consideration of this case, we exercised our bypass jurisdiction and granted <em>certiorari </em>under Maryland Code (1973, 2013 Repl. Vol.), \u00a7 12-203 of the Courts and Judicial Proceedings Article to consider the following question:</p>\n<blockquote id=\"b644-4\">Does a workers\u2019 compensation award payable by an employer and insurer for the degree of permanent disability which resulted from an accidental injury survive the death of the injured worker under \u00a7 9-632 of the Labor and Employment Article, so that it is payable to his dependents, in a case where he was found to have additional disability due to preexisting conditions which caused him to be permanently totally disabled?</blockquote>\n<p id=\"b644-5\">We hold that LE \u00a7 9-640 governs survival of benefits where a claimant is found to be permanently totally disabled irrespective of whether the claimant\u2019s permanent total disability is due solely to accidental injury or a combination of accidental injury and preexisting conditions. Because LE \u00a7 9-632 does not apply, we answer no to the question presented and affirm the judgment of the Circuit Court.</p>\n<p id=\"b644-6\">STANDARD OF REVIEW</p>\n<p id=\"b644-7\">In an appeal from judicial review of an agency action, we review the agency\u2019s decision directly, not the decision of the Circuit Court or the Court of Special Appeals. <em>Hranicka v. Chesapeake Surgical, Ltd., </em>443 Md. 289, 297, 116 A.3d 507 (2015). In reviewing a Workers\u2019 Compensation Commission decision, we must respect the expertise of the agency and accord deference to the Commission\u2019s own interpretation of the statute it administers. <em>Id. </em>A court may reverse a Commission decision \u201conly if the court finds that the Commission\u2019s action was based on an erroneous construction of the facts or law.\u201d <em>Baltimore Cnty. v. Thiergartner, </em>442 Md. 518, 529, 113 A.3d 627 (2015) (citations omitted). Although \u201c \u2018the decision of the Commission is presumed to be <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"655\">*655</page-number>prima facie correct,\u2019 \u201d this presumption does not \u201c \u2018extend to questions of law, which we review independently.\u2019 \u201d <em>Elms v. Renewal by Andersen, </em>439 Md. 381, 391, 96 A.3d 175 (2014) (quoting LE \u00a7 9-745(b) and <em>Montgomery Cnty. v. Deibler, </em>423 Md. 54, 60, 31 A.3d 191 (2011)). This appeal involves strictly a matter of law \u2014 interpretation of LE \u00a7 9-632 and \u00a7 9-640.</p>\n<p id=\"b645-4\">DISCUSSION</p>\n<p id=\"b645-5\">In deciding which provision of the Workers\u2019 Compensation Act governs survival of benefits in this case, we encounter a classic question of statutory interpretation. The cardinal rule of statutory construction is to ascertain and effectuate the intent of the General Assembly. <em>McClanahan v. Washington Cnty. Dep\u2019t of Soc. Servs., </em>445 Md. 691, 701, 129 A.3d 293 (2015). \u201cUnder the plain meaning rule, we must give the \u2018ordinary and natural meaning\u2019 to statutory language because this language is \u2018the primary source of legislative intent.\u2019 \u201d <em>Id. </em>(citation omitted). \u201cIf the intent of the legislature is clear from the words of the statute, our inquiry normally ends and we apply the plain meaning of the statute.\u201d <em>Id. </em>(citation and internal quotation marks omitted).</p>\n<p id=\"b645-6\">When interpreting the Workers\u2019 Compensation Act, \u201cadditional principles of interpretation enter the equation.\u201d <em>Deibler, </em>423 Md. at 61, 31 A.3d 191. The purpose of the Act is \u201cto protect workers and their families from hardships inflicted by work-related injuries by providing workers with compensation for loss of earning capacity resulting from accidental injury arising out of and in the course of employment.\u201d <em>Elms, </em>439 Md. at 399, 96 A.3d 175 (citation omitted). As a remedial statute, if the plain language of the Act is ambiguous or unclear, it must be \u201cconstrued as liberally in favor of injured employees as its provisions will permit in order to effectuate its benevolent purposes.\u201d <em>Id. </em>(citation and internal quotation marks omitted). We may not, however, \u201cstifle the plain meaning of the Act, or exceed its purposes, so that the injured worker may prevail.\u201d <em>Id. </em>(citation and internal quotation marks omitted). In other words, when the language is plain, <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"656\">*656</page-number>we may not create an ambiguity that does not exist in order to interpret the Act more favorably to the claimant. <em>Breitenbach v. N.B. Handy Co., </em>366 Md. 467, 473, 784 A.2d 569 (2001).</p>\n<p id=\"b646-4\">The Statutory Language Is Unambiguous</p>\n<p id=\"b646-5\">Subtitle 6 of the Workers\u2019 Compensation Act addresses benefits payable under the Act. <em>See </em>LE \u00a7\u00a7 9-601-9-689. Part IV of subtitle 6 encompasses \u00a7 9-625 through \u00a7 9-634. Section 9-625 establishes the scope of Part IV and provides that \u201c[a] covered employee who is permanently partially disabled due to an accidental personal injury or an occupational disease shall be paid compensation in accordance with this Part IV of this subtitle.\u201d LE \u00a7 9-625 (emphasis added). Accordingly, under the plain language of LE \u00a7 9-625, when an employee is determined to be permanently partially disabled, Part IV governs the payment of workers' compensation benefits. The provision governing survival benefits within Part IV \u2014 and the provision Appellant argues applies to this case \u2014 is \u00a7 9-632. Under this section, \u201c[i]f a covered employee dies from a cause that is not compensable under this title, the right to compensation that is payable under this Part IV of this subtitle and unpaid on the date of death survives in accordance with this section.\u201d LE \u00a7 9-632(b).</p>\n<p id=\"b646-7\">In contrast, Part V of subtitle 6 encompasses \u00a7 9-635 through \u00a7 9-642. Section 9-635 delineates the scope of Part V stating, \u201c[a] covered employee who is permanently totally disabled due to an accidental personal injury or an occupational disease shall be paid compensation in accordance with this Part V of this subtitle.\u201d LE \u00a7 9-635 (emphasis added). Thus, the plain language of LE \u00a7 9-635 dictates that when an employee is found to be permanently totally disabled, Part V governs the payment of benefits. The provision governing survival of benefits within Part V \u2014 and the provision Appellees contend applies to this case \u2014 is \u00a7 9-640. This provision states in pertinent part: \u201cIf a covered employee dies from a cause that is not compensable under this title, the right to compensation that is payable under this Part V of this subtitle <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"657\">*657</page-number>and unpaid on the date of death survives in accordance with this section to the extent of $45,000....\u201d LE \u00a7 9-640(b).</p>\n<p id=\"b647-4\">The Commission explicitly found that Hollingsworth was permanently totally disabled in its November 2013 award of compensation. In answering \u201c[w]hat proportion of the employee\u2019s alleged disability is due to the alleged injury, and what proportion thereof, is due to the previous permanent impairment,\u201d the Commission stated: \u201cPermanently totally disabled. 65% is due to the April 21, 2010 accidental injury (neck, right shoulder, back, and right hand), balance thereof is due to pre-existing conditions.\u201d As part of this finding, it ordered Appellees to \u201cpay unto the above-named claimant [Hollingsworth], compensation for permanent total disability.\u201d Because Part V governs the payment of benefits when an employee is found to be permanently totally disabled, \u00a7 9-640 \u2014 the provision governing survival of benefits in Part V\u2014 applies.</p>\n<p id=\"b647-5\">Appellant endeavors to avoid the clear language of the statute by claiming that the Commission\u2019s determination that Hollingsworth had a 65% permanent disability due to the accidental injury is a finding of permanent partial disability. Appellant maintains that the Commission\u2019s permanent total disability finding is the result of adding Hollingsworth\u2019s 65% disability due to accidental injury to the proportion of disability attributable to Hollingsworth\u2019s preexisting conditions. In essence, Appellant considers a permanent total disability to be a disability that is attributable solely to an accidental injury. By characterizing the Commission\u2019s finding as a permanent partial disability determination, Appellant seeks to shift Hollingsworth from Part V of Subtitle 6 of the Worker\u2019s Compensation Act (permanent total disability) to Part IV (permanent partial disability).</p>\n<p id=\"b647-6\">Appellant\u2019s argument fails, though, because permanent total disability is a separate and unique determination, not dependent upon the numerical percentage of a claimant\u2019s partial impairment. That the Commission apportioned Hollingsworth\u2019s permanent total disability between the accidental inju<page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"658\">*658</page-number>ry and his preexisting condition does not convert the Commission\u2019s permanent total disability finding into a permanent partial disability determination. A finding of permanent total disability is distinct from a finding of permanent partial disability because permanent total disability means the claimant is incapable of working. <em>See Mureddu v. Gentile, </em>233 Md. 216, 220, 196 A.2d 82 (1964) (\u201cThis Court has held that under our [Workers\u2019 Compensation] Act, total permanent disability means incapacity to do work of any kind.\u201d) (citing <em>Jewel Tea Co. v. Blamble, </em>227 Md. 1, 174 A.2d 764 (1961) and <em>Congoleum Nairn, Inc. v. Brown, </em>158 Md. 285, 148 A. 220 (1930)).</p>\n<p id=\"b648-4\">The intermediate appellate court\u2019s decision in <em>Ball v. University of Maryland, </em>137 Md.App. 229, 768 A.2d 105 (2001), supports the principle that permanent total disability is a distinct determination that does not hinge on the apportionment of a claimant\u2019s impairment. In <em>Ball, </em>the Court of Special Appeals considered whether a claimant was entitled to a cost of living adjustment under LE \u00a7 9-638 when a permanent total disability award was apportioned between the employer and insurer, and the Subsequent Injury Fund. 137 Md.App. at 231, 768 A.2d 105. As in this case, the employee in <em>Ball </em>was found to be permanently totally disabled as a result of both a work-related injury and a preexisting condition. <em>Id. </em>Writing on behalf of the court, Judge McAuliffe, sitting by special assignment, soundly rejected the employer and insurer\u2019s argument that there is a difference between permanent total disability from a single accidental injury and permanent total disability from an accidental injury combined with preexisting conditions. <em>See id. </em>at 235-36, 242, 768 A.2d 105 (\u201cWe conclude that it was the original intent of the Legislature [in \u00a7 9-638 of Part V of Subtitle 6 of the Workers\u2019 Compensation Act] to provide for an annual COLA [cost of living adjustment] in permanent total disability awards without regard to whether they involved apportionment due to a subsequent injury____\u201d). The intermediate appellate court\u2019s holding in <em>Ball </em>supports Appellees\u2019 argument that Part V governs all permanent total disability claims, including those where a permanent total disability exists due to the combined <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"659\">*659</page-number>effect of an accidental injury and an employee\u2019s preexisting conditions.</p>\n<p id=\"b649-4\">Moreover, the statutory language of LE \u00a7 9-640 reflects that the General Assembly did not consider there to be a distinction between permanent total disability from a single accidental injury and permanent total disability from an accidental injury combined with preexisting conditions. Subsection (a) of LE \u00a7 9-640 provides that benefits owed by the Subsequent Injury Fund do not survive the death of a claimant. LE \u00a7 9-640(a) (\u201cThis section does not apply to compensation paid under Title 10, Subtitle 2 [Subsequent Injury Fund] of this [Labor &amp; Employment] article.\u201d). The Subsequent Injury Fund is only liable for payment of benefits under a permanent total disability finding if the permanent total disability is apportioned between an employer and the Fund. <em>See </em>LE \u00a7 9-802(b) (detailing when covered employee is entitled to compensation from the Subsequent Injury Fund); <em>see also </em>Code of Md. Regs. 14.09.01.01B(18) (\u201c \u2018Subsequent Injury Fund\u2019 or \u2018SIF\u2019 means the statutorily created entity ... that may be a party to a claim and which pays benefits attributable to a compensable injury to previously injured body parts.\u201d). If we were to accept Appellant\u2019s argument that \u00a7 9-632 applies when a claimant\u2019s permanent total disability is from an accidental injury combined with preexisting conditions, subsection (a) of \u00a7 9-640 would be rendered nugatory. Appellant\u2019s theory thus conflicts with the well-established principle of statutory construction that \u201ca statute should be read so that no word, clause, sentence or phrase is rendered ... nugatory.\u201d <em>Motor Vehicle Admin. v. Gonce, </em>446 Md. 100, 125, 130 A.3d 436 (2016) (citation and internal quotation marks omitted); <em>see Oglesby v. State, </em>441 Md. 673, 687, 109 A.3d 1147 (2015) (\u201cOur canons of statutory interpretation, however, forbid us to \u2018construe a statute ... so that [a] word, clause, sentence, or phrase is rendered surplusage, superfluous, meaningless, or nugatory.\u2019 \u201d) (citations omitted).</p>\n<p id=\"b649-5\">In arguing that a determination of permanent total disability is equivalent to a permanent partial disability equal to <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"660\">*660</page-number>100%, Appellant blurs the difference between a finding of permanent partial disability and a determination of permanent total disability. Yet the Workers\u2019 Compensation Commission has long recognized that the General Assembly designed a separate statutory scheme for permanent total disability claims. Pursuant to the hearing procedures that the Workers\u2019 Compensation Commission has adopted in the Code of Maryland Regulations (\u201cCOMAR\u201d), a claimant must \u201c[specifically plead permanent total disability.\u201d COMAR \u00a7 14.09.03.02D(3). The regulations further stipulate that \u201c[a] claimant alleging permanent disability shall file with the Commission an Issues Form that: (1) [ejxplicitly claims permanent partial or permanent total disability.\u201d <em>Id. \u00a7 </em>14.09.09.02A (emphasis added).</p>\n<p id=\"b650-4\">Appellant\u2019s Other Arguments</p>\n<p id=\"AKC\">Appellant asserts that the November 2013 award of compensation ordered Appellees to pay benefits pursuant to the \u201cOther Cases\u201d provision in LE \u00a7 9-627 and that because this provision is part of the permanent partial disability provisions in Part IV, LE \u00a7 9-632 applies. This argument mischaracterizes the Workers\u2019 Compensation Commission\u2019s award \u2014 the award states that benefits shall not \u201cexceed the sum of $345,534.00 allowable under \u2018Other Cases.\u2019 \u201d Our opinion in <em>Subsequent Injury Fund v. Kraus </em>makes clear that the method of calculating an employer\u2019s liability when there is a permanent total disability finding apportioning liability between the employer and the Subsequent Injury Fund is simply \u201cby reference\u201d to the \u201cOther Cases\u201d provision in the permanent partial disability section of the statute. <em>See </em>301 Md. 111, 122, 482 A.2d 468 (1984) (\u201cThe assumption does not lead <em>to </em>the conclusion that the employer\u2019s contribution cannot be calculated by reference to the permanent partial disability sections or that employer and Fund payments must be concurrent.\u201d) (emphasis added). As Appellees correctly point out, the Commission\u2019s reference to the \u201cOther Cases\u201d provision in LE \u00a7 9-627 is not a directive that they pay permanent partial disability benefits. Rather, the Commission\u2019s longstanding \u201cpractice\u201d of \u201creferring] to the statutory provisions governing the <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"661\">*661</page-number>amount of award in permanent partial disability cases\u201d is merely a means by which the Commission calculates benefits owed by an employer when there is a finding of permanent total disability where the Subsequent Injury Fund is also liable. <em>See id. </em>at 119, 482 A.2d 468.</p>\n<p id=\"b651-4\">In <em>Kraus, </em>the Court considered a dispute between an employer and the Subsequent Injury Fund regarding the allocation of payments under a permanent total disability award. <em>Id. </em>at 112, 482 A.2d 468. The Commission in that case found that a Baltimore City firefighter was permanently totally disabled and that 70% of the firefighter\u2019s disability was attributable to occupational disease and 30% to a preexisting condition. <em>Id. </em>We concluded that the Commission was correct in referring to the permanent partial disability provisions of the Workers\u2019 Compensation Act to calculate the City\u2019s liability even though the firefighter was permanently totally disabled because \u201cthe percentage of disability must be converted into a dollar amount in order to determine how much of the total award is payable by the employer.\u201d <em>Id. </em>at 120, 482 A.2d 468. Accordingly, <em>Kraus </em>does not stand for the notion, as Appellant suggests, that an employer\u2019s liability in cases where the Subsequent Injury Fund is also liable is to be governed by the permanent partial disability provisions of the Workers\u2019 Compensation Act. Instead, a fair reading of <em>Kraus </em>indicates that the opinion stands for the limited principle that an employer\u2019s liability in such a case is to be calculated by referring to the applicable permanent partial disability provision to determine how much of the total award is payable by an employer.</p>\n<p id=\"b651-5\">Appellant also relies on the following language from <em>Anchor Motor Freight v. Subsequent Injury Fund </em>to support her claim that \u00a7 9-632 applies:</p>\n<blockquote id=\"b651-6\">[I]t is reasonable for the statute to hold the employer liable for the full effects of the compensable injury notwithstanding the fact that a previous impairment existed at the time of the subsequent accident.</blockquote>\n<p id=\"b651-7\">278 Md. 320, 328, 363 A.2d 505 (1976). Appellant asserts that if \u00a7 9-640 applies, the employer and insurer would be relieved <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"662\">*662</page-number>of their responsibility to pay for the full effects of the compensable injury. Appellant, however, takes this language from <em>Anchor Motor Freight </em>out of context without analyzing the circumstances under which the award in that case was made. In that case, the employer proffered that a claimant who was previously found to be permanently partially disabled as a result of the combination of an accidental injury and a preexisting condition could not later be found permanently totally disabled as a result of the worsening of the condition from the accidental injury alone. <em>Id. </em>at 327, 363 A.2d 505. We rejected this argument and held that an employer is liable for permanent total payments, even if the employee had a preexisting impairment, if the compensable injury is sufficient to cause the employee to be permanently totally disabled initially, or as a result of a subsequent worsening. <em>Id. </em>at 328-29, 363 A.2d 505. Unlike this case, which concerns an employee who was permanently totally disabled due to accidental injury and preexisting conditions, <em>Anchor Motor Freight </em>addressed an employer\u2019s liability when the claimant was permanently totally disabled as a result of the accidental injury alone. Appellant\u2019s reliance on <em>Anchor Motor Freight </em>is therefore misplaced because she attempts to divorce the opinion\u2019s language from the context in which that language was used.</p>\n<p id=\"b652-4\">Finally, Appellant points to <em>McKenzie v. C.C. Kottcamp &amp; Sons, Inc., </em>311 Md. 54, 532 A.2d 703 (1987), to support her claim that the Commission\u2019s finding Hollingsworth <em>65% </em>disabled due to accidental injury was a permanent partial disability determination. In <em>McKenzie, </em>a claimant was permanently totally disabled with 65% of the employee\u2019s disability attributable to accidental injury and 35% due to preexisting conditions \u2014 the exact apportionment in this case. <em>See id. </em>at 56, 532 A.2d 703. The Commission ordered the employer and insurer in <em>McKenzie </em>to pay benefits at the permanent partial disability rate, but ordered the Subsequent Injury Fund to pay compensation at the permanent total disability rate. <em>Id. </em>We rejected that disparity because \u201c[t]he instant case is one of compensation for permanent total disability and logically the rate of payment should be that applicable to permanent total <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"663\">*663</page-number>disability.\u201d <em>Id. </em>at 61, 532 A.2d 703. In conclusively stating that the award was one for permanent total disability, we opined:</p>\n<blockquote id=\"b653-4\">The issue in this permanent, total disability, subsequent injury, workers\u2019 compensation case is the rate at which the compensation apportioned to the employer is paid. Although the total amount of compensation payable by the employer is apportioned as if the injuiy were a permanent partial one, we shall hold ... that periodic payments of the amount so apportioned are to be paid at the rate at which permanent total disability compensation is paid.</blockquote>\n<p id=\"b653-5\"><em>Id. </em>at 55-56, 532 A.2d 703 (emphasis added). We thus agree with Appellees\u2019 contention that, \u201c[f|or the Appellants to suggest that the <em>McKenzie </em>case somehow supports their position turns the holding in <em>McKenzie </em>on its head.\u201d</p>\n<p id=\"b653-6\">CONCLUSION</p>\n<p id=\"b653-7\">Our reasoning in this case can be aptly summarized by the Workers\u2019 Compensation Commissioner\u2019s statement at the October 2014 hearing:</p>\n<blockquote id=\"b653-8\">[Tjhere is absolutely no support in the law, in the case law or in the statute, that says when there is a death of the claimant before the [Subsequent Injury Fund] starts paying that the permanent total [disability] finding simply evaporates ----To magically move from Part V to Part IV upon the death of the claimant is inconsistent with the legislative intent and is inconsistent with the statutory scheme.</blockquote>\n<p id=\"b653-10\">For these reasons, we affirm the judgment of the Circuit Court.</p>\n<p id=\"b653-11\">JUDGMENT OF THE CIRCUIT COURT FOR BALTIMORE COUNTY AFFIRMED. COSTS TO BE PAID BY APPELLANT.</p>\n</opinion>\n</casebody>\n",
