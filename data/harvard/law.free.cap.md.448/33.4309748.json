White, a member of the Bar of Maryland, represented Keith Fleming (\u201cMr. Fleming\u201d) in a divorce and custody matter (\u201cFleming matter\u201d) and Karma Sewell-Carpenter (\u201cMs. Sewell-Carpenter\u201d), in a landlord-tenant dispute (\u201cSewell matter\u201d). Between March 2012 and November 2013, Respondent was under a CDA with Bar Counsel for prior misconduct involving mismanagement of her attorney trust account. Respondent\u2019s CDA was later amended (\u201cAmended CDA\u201d), then subsequently revoked in April 2014 due to Respondent\u2019s non-compliance with the terms of the CDA. (collectively, \u201cCDA matter\u201d).</p>\n<p id=\"b72-6\">On December 30, 2014, Petitioner, the Attorney Grievance Commission of Maryland, acting through Bar Counsel, filed with this Court a Petition for Disciplinary or Remedial Action (\u201cPetition\u201d) against Respondent, based upon her representation of Mr. Fleming and Ms. Sewell-Carpenter, non-compliance with the CDA and Amended CDA, and the mishandling of her trust account throughout this period (\u201cTrust Account matter\u201d). Bar Counsel alleged that Respondent violated the <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"41\">*41</page-number>following Maryland Lawyers\u2019 Rules of Professional Conduct (\u201cMLRPC\u201d): Rule 1.1 (Competence), Rule 1.3 (Diligence), Rule 1.4(a) and (b) (Communication), Rule 1.15(a) and (d) (Safekeeping Property); 1.16(d) (Declining or Terminating Representation); 8.1(a) and (b) (Bar Admission and Disciplinary Matters); and Rule 8.4(a), (c), and (d) (Misconduct).</p>\n<p id=\"b73-5\">Bar Counsel also alleged that Respondent violated Maryland Rules 16-606.1 (Attorney Trust Account Record-Keeping), 16-607 (Commingling of Funds), 16-609 (Prohibited Transactions), and Md.Code (1989, 2010 Repl. Vol) \u00a7 10-306 of the Business Occupations &amp; Professions Article (\u201cBus. Occ. &amp; Prof.\u201d) (Misuse of Trust Money).</p>\n<p id=\"b73-6\">By Order dated January 9, 2015, this Court transmitted the matter to the Circuit Court for Baltimore City and designated the Honorable Edward R.K. Hargadon (\u201chearing judge\u201d) to render findings of fact and conclusions of law. On April 17, 2015, both parties participated in a scheduling conference call with the hearing judge, setting a hearing for June 24, 2015 at 9:30 a.m. On or about June 22, Respondent informed the court that she was unable to attend the hearing due to her representation of a client in a murder trial that day.</p>\n<p id=\"b73-7\">On July 14, 2015, a hearing was conducted. Present were Bar Counsel and Respondent. Ms. Sewell-Carpenter, Edwin Karr (\u201cMr. Karr\u201d), Investigator for the Attorney Grievance Commission, Anne Deady, Esquire (\u201cMs. Deady\u201d), the law practice monitor assigned to Respondent under her Amended CDA, and Laura Burrows, an attorney who worked with Respondent on an unrelated matter, testified on behalf of Bar Counsel. Respondent represented herself and testified. On September 4, 2015, the hearing judge filed with this Court findings of fact and conclusions of law, determining that: (1) relative to the Fleming matter and Respondent\u2019s CDA and Amended CDA violations, she violated MLRPC 1.1, 1.4, 1.15,<footnotemark>2</footnotemark> 8.4(a) and (d), and Md. Rule 16-606.1; (2) regarding Respondent\u2019s false statements and misrepresentations to Bar Counsel, she violated MLRPC 8.1(a) and (b), 8.4(a), (c), and (d); (3) <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"42\">*42</page-number>relative to the Sewell matter, she violated MLRPC 1.1, 1.3, 1.4, 1.16(d), 8.4(d); and (4) regarding the Trust Account matter, she violated MLRPC 1.1,1.15(a), 8.4(d), Md. Rules 16-606.1(a)(l)-(3), 16-607, 16-609(b) and (c), and Bus. Occ. and Prof. \u00a7 10-306.</p>\n<p id=\"b74-5\">On September 22, 2015, Bar Counsel filed its recommendation for sanctions, requesting indefinite suspension with the right to apply for readmission after six months, and took no exceptions to the hearing judge\u2019s findings of fact or conclusions of law. On September 23, 2015, Respondent filed general exceptions to the hearing judge\u2019s findings and conclusions, which she subsequently amended on September 30, 2015 and February 9, 2016.<footnotemark>3</footnotemark> On February 9, 2016, we heard oral argument. Respondent conceded that she engaged in professional misconduct relative to the alleged charges, but attributed her actions to illness, recuperation after surgery, and difficulties experienced as caretaker of her mother until her death, which collectively impacted her practice during those periods.</p>\n<p id=\"b74-6\">For the reasons that follow, we conclude that Respondent violated MLRPC 1.1, 1.3, 1.4(a) and (b), 1.15(a), 1.16(d), 8.1(a) and (b), 8.4(a), (c), and (d), Md. Rules 16-606.1(a)(l)-(3), 16-607, 16-609(b) and (c), and Bus. Occ. and Prof. \u00a7 10-306, and will indefinitely suspend her from the practice of law in this State with the right to apply for readmission after six months.</p>\n<p id=\"b74-7\">BACKGROUND</p>\n<p id=\"b74-8\">The hearing judge rendered the following findings of fact, which we summarize:</p>\n<p id=\"b74-9\">\n<em>A. Respondent\u2019s CDA, Subsequent Amended CDA, and the Fleming Matter</em>\n</p>\n<p id=\"b74-10\">Respondent was admitted to the Bar of Maryland on November 3, 2007, and currently maintains a law office in Balti<page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"43\">*43</page-number>more, Maryland. On March 21, 2012, Respondent entered into a one-year CDA with Bar Counsel.</p>\n<p id=\"b75-5\">Pursuant to Md. Rule 16-736(c)(2)(A),<footnotemark>4</footnotemark> Respondent acknowledged that she had engaged in professional misconduct relative to her representation of Mr. Fleming.<footnotemark>5</footnotemark> Under the CDA, Respondent was required to review a Continuing Legal Education DVD on trust account management. However, two months prior to completing the CDA, Respondent failed to fulfill her obligations due to a failure to timely deposit funds into her trust account and to provide client records to Bar Counsel. As a result, on November 25, 2013, Bar Counsel amended Respondent\u2019s CDA and assigned Ms. Deady as her law practice monitor. The Amended CDA contained the following conditions:</p>\n<blockquote id=\"b75-6\">Respondent will provide [Ms. Deady] with a copy of her general ledger, individual client ledgers, monthly trust account reconciliation, trust account statement, and corresponding cancelled checks on a monthly basis for her monitor to submit to Bar Counsel for the remainder of the Amended CDA.</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b76-3\"><page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"44\">*44</page-number>Respondent will attend a meeting with Certified Public Accountant/Commission Investigator Charles Miller [ (\u201cMr. Miller\u201d) ] to review Respondent\u2019s financial records and to discuss Respondent\u2019s trust account questions. Respondent will bring a copy of her general ledger, individual client ledgers, monthly reconciliation and monthly trust account statements from the previous three months with her to the meeting for Mr. Miller to review. Respondent will set a meeting date with Mr. Miller by no later than seven [ ] days after the new effective date of the Amended CDA. The meeting date shall occur within twenty [] days of the effective date of the Amended CDA.</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b76-4\">[Ms. Deady] shall be required to attend a formal hearing/court proceeding -with Respondent within two [ ] months from the new effective date of the Amended CDA and to complete a client observation form in connection with the hearing/proceeding.</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b76-5\">[Ms. Deady] shall continue to provide reports to Bar Counsel on a monthly basis and submit each report on the 30th day of the month. In addition, Respondent shall meet with [Ms. Deady] on a monthly basis on the twentieth [ ] day of each month. During the meeting, Respondent shall discuss her Amended CDA in detail, provide any needed trust account records and/or billing documentation to the monitor, and to submit her written report of her biggest challenges and/or goals/accomplishments for the month.</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b76-6\">Respondent\u2019s Amended CDA shall remain in effect until July 31, 2014.</blockquote>\n<p id=\"b76-7\">i. <em>Respondent\u2019s Interactions with Ms. Deady</em></p>\n<p id=\"b76-8\">Respondent admitted that during November 2013 through February 2014, she failed to provide the information to Ms. Deady and Mr. Miller regarding her general ledger, individual client ledgers, monthly reconciliation, trust account bank statement, and corresponding cancelled checks on a monthly basis. On November 8, 2013, Respondent met with Ms. Deady in her law office, to review her files. Respondent promised to submit copies of her client ledgers, trust account <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"45\">*45</page-number>reconciliation statements, and trust account bank statements per CDA requirements by November 20, 2013. Due to Respondent\u2019s other commitments,<footnotemark>6</footnotemark> Ms. Deady did not timely receive the proper documents for her November 2013 report to Bar Counsel.</p>\n<p id=\"b77-4\">Ms. Deady submitted her second monthly report to Bar Counsel on January 10, 2014, which reflected that she contacted Respondent on January 6, 2014 for the required documents. However, Respondent advised that she was unable to comply due to scheduled surgery that same day. Although Respondent promised to provide the documentation after her recuperation, she did not.</p>\n<p id=\"b77-5\">Ms. Deady left a voicemail for Respondent on January 30, 2014. In Ms. Deady\u2019s third monthly report to Bar Counsel, she advised that Respondent had not contacted her since January 6, 2014. Bar Counsel granted Respondent an eight-day extension to submit her documentation to Ms. Deady. Ms. Deady\u2019s fourth monthly report to Bar Counsel on February 28, 2014, reflected that she contacted Respondent on February 25, 2014 to schedule an appointment on February 27, 2014, and noted Respondent\u2019s failure to provide any documents or meet with her since November 2013. However, Respondent was unable to meet with Ms. Deady on February 27, citing a need to prepare for a motion and complications from her surgery.</p>\n<p id=\"b77-6\">ii. <em>Respondent\u2019s Interactions with Attorney Grievance Commission Investigator, Mr. Karr</em></p>\n<p id=\"b77-7\">In February 2014, Mr. Karr contacted Respondent regarding the impending revocation of her Amended CDA. Mr. Karr conducted an interview of Ms. Sewell-Carpenter on March 6, 2014, but received no response from Respondent after leaving voice messages on March 7 and 10, 2014. On March 11, 2014, <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"46\">*46</page-number>Mr. Karr contacted Respondent and scheduled an interview for March 25, 2014, at 11:00 a.m.</p>\n<p id=\"b78-5\">During the hearing, Mr. Karr testified that Respondent attempted to cancel the interview, citing an impending trial and inquired whether he could provide her with written questions in advance. Mr. Karr directed her to Assistant Bar Counsel JaCina Stanton (\u201cMs. Stanton\u201d). Mr. Karr and Ms. Stanton subsequently cancelled the interview and agreed that Respondent could provide a statement under oath.</p>\n<p id=\"b78-6\">iii. <em>Respondent\u2019s Failure to Protect Client\u2019s Interests</em></p>\n<p id=\"b78-7\">In light of Respondent\u2019s upcoming surgery and anticipated recuperation period, Ms. Stanton requested information from Respondent on November 26, 2013 regarding the status of her cases scheduled for January 2014. In a reply e-mail sent on December 5, 2013, Respondent stated:</p>\n<blockquote id=\"b78-8\">I have already discussed the matter with most of my clients and am in the process of discussing it with the rest. I have already addressed the issue of court dates as I have explained to the [cjourt what my situation is and requested court dates in accordance with my expected return to work. I also advised the [c]ourt that I will notify them if anything changes or I need more time....</blockquote>\n<p id=\"b78-9\">On January 24, 2014, Ms. Stanton requested that Respondent provide further information regarding three separate cases that were scheduled for jury trial.<footnotemark>7</footnotemark> Although Respondent indicated that she postponed the cases, they nonetheless remained on the docket for trial. Contrary to Respondent\u2019s December 5 e-mail that she was communicating with her clients about their cases, she failed to advise Ms. SewellCarpenter about her pending hearing scheduled for January 24, 2014. On March 17, 2014, Respondent informed Bar Counsel that she contacted her clients and the court involving <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"47\">*47</page-number>her cases, without providing an explanation regarding the trial date in the Sewell matter.<footnotemark>8</footnotemark></p>\n<p id=\"b79-5\">\n<em>B. Sewell Matter</em>\n</p>\n<p id=\"b79-6\">On December 3, 2005, Ms. Sewell-Carpenter signed a commercial lease agreement with ELT Corporation to rent space for a dance studio she operated named Karma\u2019s Dance Factory. Rachel Oziel (\u201cMs. Oziel\u201d) and her husband, Madgi Oziel owned ELT. On or about September 4, 2012, Ms. Oziel filed suit against Ms. Sewell-Carpenter on her own behalf, in the amount of $5,997 in the District Court for Baltimore County for failure to pay rent. <em>(Oziel v. Sewell, </em>Case No. 080400197772012). On November 27, 2012, the District Court entered judgment against Ms. Sewell-Carpenter in the amount of $6,907.</p>\n<p id=\"b79-7\">Twice during November or December 2012, Respondent discussed possible representation with Ms. Sewell-Carpenter. Ms. Sewell-Carpenter advised Respondent of the November 27 judgment, but Respondent never recommended that Ms. Sewell-Carpenter file an appeal or a motion to revise judgment within thirty days. During the disciplinary hearing, Respondent indicated that she thought she had ninety days to seek an amended or revised judgment.</p>\n<p id=\"b79-8\">On February 23, 2013, Ms. Sewell-Carpenter formally retained Respondent after submitting two credit card payments totaling $1,500. That same day, Respondent sent Ms. SewellCarpenter an e-mail, outlining the legal services that she would provide, but did not address the likelihood of success. <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"48\">*48</page-number>Ms. Sewell-Carpenter never responded to the February 23 email<footnotemark>9</footnotemark> or executed a retainer agreement.</p>\n<p id=\"b80-5\">On February 26, 2013, Respondent filed a \u201cMotion to Set Aside Judgment\u201d (\u201cMotion to Set Aside\u201d), ninety-one days after the judgment was entered against Ms. Sewell-Carpenter, based on fraud, mistake or irregularity. The motion was denied on March 13, 2013. Respondent also filed a \u201cMotion for Reconsideration\u201d of the denial of the Motion to Set Aside. During the hearing on June 11, 2013, Respondent neglected to bring Ms. Sewell-Carpenter\u2019s file. The court subsequently denied the motion. Throughout this period, Respondent never provided Ms. Sewell-Carpenter with copies of the motions filed on her behalf. Although Respondent advised Ms. Se-well-Carpenter that she would send a copy of her file, she did not do so until December 2013, two months after Ms. SewellCarpenter filed a complaint with the Attorney Grievance Commission against Respondent on October 8, 2013.</p>\n<p id=\"b80-6\">On November 27, 2013, Ms. Sewell-Carpenter filed a Motion to Vacate Judgment <em>pro se. </em>A hearing on the matter was scheduled for January 24, 2014. Ms. Sewell-Carpenter was officially notified of a motions hearing and notice was also sent to Respondent, who remained counsel of record. Respondent claimed that she was absent from her law office throughout the month of January due to illness, neglected to check her mail, and never implemented forwarding procedures during her period of recuperation.</p>\n<p id=\"b80-7\">Although Respondent\u2019s representation of Ms. Sewell-Carpenter ended in June 2013, she failed to file a motion to strike appearance with the court. Ms. Sewell-Carpenter\u2019s motion was subsequently dismissed for her failure to appear for the hearing on January 24. As a result, her wages were garnished in the amount of $6,907 to satisfy the judgment. On <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"49\">*49</page-number>February 11, 2014, Ms. Sewell-Carpenter\u2019s subsequent motion to reset a hearing date was denied. Respondent did not file a motion to withdraw her appearance as counsel until March 11, 2014.</p>\n<p id=\"b81-5\">\n<em>C. Trust Account Matter</em>\n</p>\n<p id=\"b81-6\">Bar Counsel subpoenaed Respondent\u2019s trust account bank statements from December 2012 to March 2014. During the hearing, Respondent conceded that she had not maintained accurate records or retained checks for her trust account during this period. Between May and July 2013, attorney\u2019s fees for two unspecified clients were applied to negative balances. Respondent was unable to identify the particular clients whose funds were affected by the negative balances.</p>\n<p id=\"b81-7\">In July 2013, Respondent made a cash withdrawal and subsequently -wrote a check payable in October 2013 from her trust account without a memo, both in the amount of $50.00. Respondent also wrote a check payable to \u201cCash\u201d in the amount of $420, with a memo indicating \u201cUSCIS Fee Wolf Case.\u201d During the hearing, Respondent conceded that this transaction was violative of trust account rules.</p>\n<p id=\"b81-8\">Beginning October 31, 2013, Respondent\u2019s trust account had a negative balance of $11.20. The trust account remained in that status for the next five months until March 31, 2014, when her ending trust account balance was $36.00. Respondent conceded that during the period of her CDA or Amended CD A, she neglected to note clients\u2019 names on the majority of her checks and deposit slips.</p>\n<p id=\"b81-9\">STANDARD OF REVIEW</p>\n<p id=\"b81-10\">\u201cThis Court has original and complete jurisdiction over attorney disciplinary proceedings.\u201d <em>Attorney Grievance Comm\u2019n v. Barton, </em>442 Md. 91, 119, 110 A.3d 668, 684 (2015) (citations omitted). \u201cBar counsel ha[s] the burden of proving [the] allegations in the disciplinary petition by clear and convincing evidence.\u201d <em>Attorney Grievance Comm\u2019n v. Edib, </em>415 Md. 696, 706, 4 A.3d 957, 964 (2010). <em>See also </em>Md. Rule <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"50\">*50</page-number>16 \u2014 757(b) (\u201cThe [Commission] has the burden of proving the averments of the petition by clear and convincing evidence.\u201d).</p>\n<p id=\"b82-5\">We conduct an independent review of the record and accept the hearing judge\u2019s findings of fact unless they are clearly erroneous. <em>See Barton, </em>442 Md. at 119, 110 A.3d at 684 (citation omitted). Deference is accorded to the hearing judge\u2019s findings, who is in the best position, as the fact-finder, to assess the credibility of a witness. <em>See Edib, </em>415 Md. at 706-07, 4 A.3d at 964. <em>See also </em>Md. Rule 16-759(b)(2)(B) (\u201cThe Court [of Appeals] shall give due regard to the opportunity of the hearing judge to assess the credibility of witnesses.\u201d). \u201cFindings of fact to which neither party takes exception may be treated by us as conclusively established.\u201d <em>Edib, </em>415 Md. at 707, 4 A.3d at 964. <em>See also </em>Md. Rule 16-759(b)(2)(A).</p>\n<p id=\"b82-6\">However, if exceptions are filed, \u201cthe Court of Appeals shall determine whether the findings of fact have been proven by the requisite standard of proof\u2019 outlined in Md. Rule 16-757(b).<footnotemark>10</footnotemark> <em>See </em>Md. Rule 16-759(b)(2)(B). We review <em>de novo, </em>the hearing judge\u2019s conclusions of law. <em>See Edib, </em>415 Md. at 707, 4 A.3d at 964. <em>See also </em>Md. Rule 16-759(b)(1) (\u201cThe Court of Appeals shall review <em>[de novo] </em>the [hearing] judge\u2019s conclusions of law.\u201d).</p>\n<p id=\"b82-7\">DISCUSSION</p>\n<p id=\"A6\">\n<em>A. Findings of Fact</em>\n</p>\n<p id=\"b82-8\">Bar Counsel does not except to any of the hearing judge\u2019s findings of fact. However, Respondent excepts to the findings relative to her interactions with Commission Investigator, Mr. Karr. Respondent contends that her exhibits evidenced a <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"51\">*51</page-number>series of communications with Bar Counsel, reflecting that she asked whether Mr. Karr could provide questions in advance to ensure that the interview \u201cwas productive and went smoothly.\u201d Respondent asserts that she did not refuse to meet with Mr. Karr, although the hearing judge adopted the position that Bar Counsel and Mr. Karr decided that Respondent would provide a statement under oath, in lieu of her meeting with Mr. Karr.</p>\n<p id=\"b83-5\">We shall overrule Respondent\u2019s exceptions. Although the evidence does not reflect that Respondent refused to meet with Mr. Karr,<footnotemark>11</footnotemark> it does demonstrate that she did request questions \u201cahead of time,\u201d which prompted the alternate resolution agreed upon by Ms. Stanton and Mr. Karr. In response to her request, Ms. Stanton advised, in part:</p>\n<blockquote id=\"b83-6\">You advised Commission Investigator, [Mr.] Karr that you would not sit for an interview unless you were provided with written questions in advance. The Maryland Rules do not require us to provide respondents with written questions prior to interviews.</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b83-7\">Pursuant to [Md.] Rule 16-732, we are requesting that you attend a Statement under oath for this matter....</blockquote>\n<p id=\"b83-8\">Thus, the hearing judge\u2019s findings that 1) Respondent \u201cinquired whether Mr. Karr would provide her with written <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"52\">*52</page-number>questions prior to being interviewed^]\u201d 2) Mr. Karr subsequently advised that this was not standard protocol; and 3) Mr. Karr and Ms. Stanton agreed that Respondent would provide a statement under oath in lieu of an interview, were consistent with the evidence.</p>\n<p id=\"b84-5\">Respondent excepts to the hearing judge\u2019s findings regarding the extent of her communications with clients, as reflected in her March 17, 2014 correspondence to Bar Counsel. She contends that those client communications began on November 26, 2013, and during that time, the averments were accurate, with the exception of Ms. Sewell-Carpenter. Although Respondent concedes that she neglected the Sewell matter, she nonetheless avers that she did not have a duty to Ms. Sewell-Carpenter because she \u201cacted on her own\u201d without Respondent\u2019s knowledge when she filed motions <em>pro se.</em></p>\n<p id=\"b84-6\">We overrule Respondent\u2019s exceptions. As an initial matter, the fact that Ms. Sewell-Carpenter filed motions <em>pro se, </em>is of no consequence to the hearing judge\u2019s findings that she failed to advise Ms. Sewell-Carpenter about the January 2014 hearing \u2014 after receiving notification from the court. Moreover, the December 5, 2013 e-mail to Bar Counsel, Respondent stated:</p>\n<blockquote id=\"b84-7\">I have already discussed the matter with most of my clients and am in the process of discussing it with the rest....</blockquote>\n<p id=\"Aj\">Although Respondent references the March 17 correspondence to Bar Counsel, it was Respondent\u2019s December 5 e-mail that the hearing judge relied upon in determining that Respondent misrepresented the client communications regarding their cases. Respondent neglected to correct any prior misrepresentations in the March 17 correspondence. Additionally, Respondent conceded that she neglected the Sewell matter, although she remained counsel of record until she withdrew her representation in March 2014.</p>\n<p id=\"b84-9\">Respondent excepts to the hearing judge\u2019s findings regarding initial conversations with Ms. Sewell-Carpenter, where the hearing judge stated, in part, \u201cMs. Sewell[-Carpenter] advised Respondent of the judgment, but Respondent never informed <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"53\">*53</page-number>Ms. Sewell[-Carpenter] that she had to file an appeal, or a motion to revise judgment, within thirty days of the judgment.\u201d Respondent contends that if Mr. Karr\u2019s statements in his interim report are believed, his interview with Ms. SewellCarpenter in March of 2014 reflects that Respondent was not hired until after her trial and entry of judgment on November 27, 2012, and that her $1,500 fee payment was not made until February 23, 2013. Respondent further contends that Mr. Karr\u2019s report demonstrated Ms. Sewell-Carpenter\u2019s understanding that Respondent would not perform any work on her behalf until she remitted full payment.</p>\n<p id=\"b85-4\">We shall overrule Respondent\u2019s exceptions. We acknowledge that Ms. Sewell-Carpenter conceded that she did not consider Respondent her attorney until January or February of 2013. However, Respondent\u2019s contentions do not negate that once Respondent became aware of Ms. Sewell-Carpenter\u2019s judgment, she failed to inform her of the urgency of the situation or the time-sensitive nature of an appeal in the matter.</p>\n<p id=\"b85-5\">It is well settled that in forming an attorney-client relationship, a formal contract or retainer agreement is not necessary. <em>See Attorney Grievance Comm\u2019n v. Shoup, </em>410 Md. 462, 489, 979 A.2d 120, 136 (2009). (\u201c[A]n explicit agreement or payment arrangement is not a prerequisite to the formation of an attorney-client relationship.\u201d). Thus, \u201cthe determination of whether an attorney-client relationship exists can, and often must, be implied from facts and circumstances of a given case.\u201d <em>Attorney Grievance Comm\u2019n of Maryland v. Shaw, </em>354 Md. 636, 650-51, 732 A.2d 876, 883 (1999). <em>See also Attorney Grievance Comm\u2019n of Maryland v.

Moreover, although the evidence reflects that Respondent advised Ms. Sewell-Carpenter that she would not work on her case until full payment was received, the evidence does not demonstrate that Respondent \u201cdispelled\u201d any expectations of legal representation prior to that point.</p>\n<p id=\"b86-5\">Respondent also excepts to the hearing judge\u2019s finding that Ms. Sewell-Carpenter did not respond regarding the scope of her representation and fees, because the evidence reflects that Ms. Sewell-Carpenter stated in a reply e-mail, \u201c[t]his will be fine. I agree.\u201d Although we sustain Respondent\u2019s exception, Ms. Sewell-Carpenter\u2019s reply to Respondent\u2019s February 23 email as expressed, <em>supra, </em>does not impact any of the charges asserted by Bar Counsel. Respondent neglected the Sewell matter and violated several Rules of Professional Conduct and Maryland trust account rules.</p>\n<p id=\"b86-6\">Respondent excepts to the hearing judge\u2019s findings regarding her responsibility for Ms. Sewell-Carpenter filing a <em>pro se </em>motion to vacate the November 27, 2012 judgment against her. Respondent contends that \u201c[tjhere was no testimony\u201d indicating that Ms. Sewell-Carpenter considered Respondent as her <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"55\">*55</page-number>attorney at that time or that she had informed Respondent of the Motion to Vacate and reset of the hearing date. Respondent also contends that she had already \u201cwound down\u201d her practice due to her surgery. We shall overrule Respondent\u2019s exceptions. As noted <em>supra, </em>Respondent conceded, and we agree, that she neglected matters pertaining to the Sewell matter. Without express termination, Respondent remained counsel of record until she withdrew her representation in March 2014.</p>\n<p id=\"b87-5\">Respondent excepts to the hearing judge\u2019s findings that she did not provide Ms. Sewell-Carpenter with copies of the motions filed on her behalf during the course of her representation. She asserts that copies of the motions were attached to an e-mail she sent on March 20, 2013, to the e-mail addresses Ms. Sewell-Carpenter verified during the hearing.</p>\n<p id=\"b87-6\">We shall overrule Respondent\u2019s exceptions and accept the hearing judge\u2019s findings in light of his opportunity to assess the credibility of the witnesses. <em>See Attorney Grievance Comm\u2019n v. Siskind, </em>401 Md. 41, 54, 930 A.2d 328, 335 (2007) (noting that \u201cwe accept the hearing judge\u2019s findings of fact as <em>[prima facie] </em>correct unless shown to be \u2018clearly erroneous,\u2019 and we give due regard to the hearing judge\u2019s opportunity to assess the credibility of witnesses.\u201d). The hearing judge found credence in Ms. Sewell-Carpenter\u2019s testimony that she did not receive copies of motions until July 2014, approximately four months after Respondent withdrew as counsel. We conclude that this finding was not erroneous based upon the evidence presented.</p>\n<p id=\"b87-7\">Respondent excepts to the hearing judge\u2019s findings regarding the negative balances in her trust account. She contends that the balances were a result of maintenance fees assessed to the account, which were subsequently refunded. Respondent also contends that the maintenance fees were assessed during a period when there was no activity because she was \u201cwinding down\u201d her practice in preparation for surgery. We shall overrule Respondent\u2019s exceptions. Although the negative balances were due to maintenance fees that were subse<page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"56\">*56</page-number>quently refunded, she failed to maintain the account in accordance with the trust account rules discussed, <em>infra.</em></p>\n<p id=\"b88-4\">Respondent excepts to the hearing judge\u2019s findings regarding the $420 USCIS check made payable to \u201cCash.\u201d She contends that a copy of the check admitted into evidence indicates that the cash withdrawal was immediately payable as a bank check to USCIS, with a confirmation receipt verifying same. Nonetheless, we shall overrule her exceptions. As we discuss <em>infra, </em>Respondent\u2019s practices contravened the trust account rules requiring proper record-keeping.</p>\n<p id=\"b88-5\">\n<em>B. Conclusions of Law</em>\n</p>\n<p id=\"b88-6\">In light of the foregoing findings of fact, the hearing judge concluded that Respondent engaged in professional misconduct in violation of the MLRPC 1.1 (Sewell, Trust, and CDA/Fleming Matters), 1.3 (Sewell Matter), 1.4 (Sewell and CDA/Fleming Matter), 1.15(a) (Trust and CDA/Fleming Matter), 1.16(d) (Sewell Matter), 8.1(a) (Sewell Matter) and (b) (CDA/Fleming Matter), 8.4(a), (c) (CDA/Fleming Matter), and (d), Md. Rules 16 \u2014 606.1(a)(1)\u2014(3) (Trust and CDA/Fleming Matter), 16-607, 16-609(b) and (c), and Bus. Occ. and Prof. \u00a7 10-306 (collectively, Trust Account matter).<footnotemark>13</footnotemark></p>\n<p id=\"b88-7\">Bar Counsel does not except to the hearing judge\u2019s conclusions of law. Although Respondent generally excepts to the hearing judge\u2019s findings of fact, none of her exceptions specifically address the hearing judge\u2019s conclusions of law. For the reasons that follow, we shall uphold the conclusions of law.</p>\n<p id=\"b88-8\">MLRPC 1.1 (Competence)</p>\n<p id=\"b88-9\">MLRPC 1.1 provides, \u201c[a] lawyer shall provide competent representation to a client. Competent representation <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"57\">*57</page-number>requires the legal knowledge, skill, thoroughness and preparation reasonably necessary for the representation.\u201d MLRPC 1.1 requires that an attorney act with the \u201crequisite preparation and thoroughness\u201d when representing a client. <em>See Attorney Grievance Comm\u2019n of Maryland v. Mitchell, </em>445 Md. 241, 252, 126 A.3d 72, 78 (2015). An attorney also violates this Rule by failing to act or acting in an untimely manner, which results in harm to a client. <em>See Attorney Grievance Comm\u2019n v. Brown, </em>426 Md. 298, 319, 44 A.3d 344, 357 (2012).</p>\n<p id=\"b89-4\">Clear and convincing evidence supports the hearing judge\u2019s conclusion that Respondent violated MLRPC 1.1 when she filed the Motion to Set Aside Ms. Sewell-Carpenter\u2019s November 27, 2012 judgment beyond the thirty-day deadline. <em>Attorney Grievance Comm\u2019n v. Walker-Turner, </em>428 Md. 214, 228, 51 A.3d 553, 561-62 (2012) (stating that an attorney\u2019s \u201cfailure to file a necessary appeal or revisory motion within the allowable time period may constitute incompetence in the practice of law.\u201d). <em>See also Attorney Grievance Comm\u2019n v. Costanzo, </em>432 Md. 233, 253, 68 A.3d 808, 819 (2013) (stating that \u201c[a] failure to make the proper and required filings in a client matter demonstrates a lack of the appropriate preparation and thoroughness necessary to provide competent representation\u201d in violation of MLRPC 1.1.).</p>\n<p id=\"b89-5\">The evidence demonstrates that Respondent also violated MLRPC 1.1 by failing to sufficiently explain the likelihood of her success in filing the motion ninety-one days after the judgment was entered. Respondent\u2019s confusion regarding the deadline for filing post-judgment motions under the Maryland Rules and the lack of effort to clarify her misunderstandings is also violative of this Rule. <em>See Attorney Grievance Comm\u2019n v. Zhang, </em>440 Md. 128, 158, 100 A.3d 1112, 1129 (2014) (\u201cEvidence of a failure to apply the requisite thoroughness and/or preparation in representing a client is sufficient alone to support a violation of [MLRPC] 1.1.\u201d) (internal quotations omitted).</p>\n<p id=\"b89-6\">An attorney\u2019s failure to properly maintain his or her trust account demonstrates incompetence, in violation of <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"58\">*58</page-number>MLRPC 1.1. <em>See Attorney Grievance Comm\u2019n v. Mungin, </em>489 Md. 290, 305, 96 A.3d 122, 130 (2014). Additionally, \u201c[s]ound record-keeping is an essential part of competent representation.\u201d <em>Attorney Grievance Comm\u2019n v. London, </em>427 Md. 328, 353, 47 A.3d 986, 1001 (2012). Thus, competent representation requires, <em>inter alia, </em>that an attorney maintain detailed, accurate, and accessible records. <em>Id.</em></p>\n<p id=\"b90-5\">Clear and convincing evidence also supports the hearing judge\u2019s conclusion that Respondent violated MLRPC 1.1 by: 1) failing to maintain proper client records throughout the entirety of her CDA and Amended CD A; 2) failing to comply with the basic requirements of appropriate trust account management in her accounting practices; 3) failing to pay attention to her trust account, which resulted in repeated negative balances from October 31, 2013 through March 31, 2014; and 4) admitting ignorance of the trust account rules.</p>\n<p id=\"b90-6\">Respondent\u2019s actions involving tracking her time, disbursing funds, and maintaining client ledgers also demonstrated a lack of competence in appropriate billing practices and handling of client funds. Moreover, as the hearing judge concluded, Respondent\u2019s non-compliant record-keeping and accounting practices demonstrated a lack of competence in \u201cthis vital area of law practice management^]\u201d which violated MLRPC 1.1.</p>\n<p id=\"b90-7\">MLRPC 1.3 (Diligence)</p>\n<p id=\"b90-8\">MLRPC 1.3 provides, \u201c[a] lawyer shall act with reasonable diligence and promptness in representing a client.\u201d Inexcusable delay in withdrawing as counsel constitutes a violation of this Rule. <em>See Attorney Grievance Comm\u2019n v. Steinberg, </em>395 Md. 337, 363, 910 A.2d 429, 444 (2006).</p>\n<p id=\"b90-9\">Clear and convincing evidence supports the hearing judge\u2019s conclusion that Respondent\u2019s failure to withdraw as counsel in the Sewell matter until March 11, 2014, when the case concluded in June 2013, violated Rule 1.3. <em>See id. </em>(holding that attorney\u2019s \u201cinexcusable six-month delay in -withdrawing formally from the court case, after his representation was terminated, demonstrates a lack of requisite diligence and <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"59\">*59</page-number>promptness.\u201d). Accordingly, Respondent also violated Rule 1.3 for failing to timely deliver Ms. Sewell-Carpenter\u2019s file upon her request beyond the conclusion of the case. <em>See Attorney Grievance Comm\u2019n v. Awuah, </em>374 Md. 505, 522, 823 A.2d 651, 661(2003) (holding that the attorney violated MLRPC 1.3 by failing to deliver his client\u2019s file after termination of the representation, despite the client\u2019s repeated requests).</p>\n<p id=\"b91-5\">MLRPC Rule 1.4 (Communication)</p>\n<p id=\"b91-6\">MLRPC 1.4 provides:</p>\n<blockquote id=\"b91-7\">(a) A lawyer shall:</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b91-8\">(1) promptly inform the client of any decision or circumstance with respect to which the client\u2019s informed consent, as defined in Rule 1.0(f), is required by these Rules;</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b91-9\">(2) keep the client reasonably informed about the status of the matter;</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b91-10\">(3) promptly comply with reasonable requests for information; and</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b91-11\">(4) consult with the client about any relevant limitation on the lawyer\u2019s conduct when the lawyer knows that the client expects assistance not permitted by the Maryland Lawyers\u2019 Rules of Professional Conduct or other law.</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b91-12\">(b) A lawyer shall explain a matter to the extent reasonably necessary to permit the client to make informed decisions regarding the representation.</blockquote>\n<p id=\"b91-13\">\u201c[MLRPC] 1.4 requires a lawyer to comply promptly with reasonable requests from the client for information, to explain on-going matters to the extent reasonably necessary to allow a client to make informed decisions, and to keep the client informed about the status of pending matters.\u201d <em>Steinberg, </em>395 Md. at 363, 910 A.2d at 444.</p>\n<p id=\"b91-14\">Clear and convincing evidence supports the hearing judge\u2019s conclusion that Respondent violated MLRPC 1.4 by failing to advise Ms. Sewell-Carpenter of the statutory time to appeal a judgment and file a motion to revise same, then <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"60\">*60</page-number>failing to advise regarding their impact on her case. <em>See Attorney Grievance Comm\u2019n v.

Ms. Sewell-Carpenter\u2019s ability to appeal the judgment entered against her was significantly diminished due to Respondent\u2019s handling of her post-judgment appeal. <em>See Steinberg, </em>395 Md. at 363, 910 A.2d at 444 (noting that client \u201csuffered significant set-backs in her efforts to overturn the sanctions imposed due to the omissions of [the attorney].\u201d).</p>\n<p id=\"b92-5\">Clear and convincing evidence also demonstrates that Respondent violated MLRPC 1.4 when she failed to return Ms. Sewell-Carpenter\u2019s file until several months after her request. <em>See Steinberg, </em>395 Md. at 363, 910 A.2d at 444 (holding that the attorney violated MLRPC 1.4 by failing to return her client\u2019s file until \u201cmuch later\u201d after representation was terminated, despite client\u2019s repeated requests).</p>\n<p id=\"b92-6\">MLRPC Rule 1.15(a) and (d) (Safekeeping Property)</p>\n<p id=\"Arb\">MLRPC 1.15(a) provides:</p>\n<blockquote id=\"b92-7\">A lawyer shall hold property of clients or third persons that is in a lawyer\u2019s possession in connection with a representation separate from the lawyer\u2019s own property.

While under the CDA, the attorney\u2019s law practice monitor reported to Bar Counsel several instances of irregularities and improper fee disbursements in the attorney\u2019s escrow account. <em>Id. </em>at 695-97, 919 A.2d at 672-73. Specifically, the attorney\u2019s account was overdrawn on three occasions, which resulted in overdraft fees, the attorney improperly notated settlement checks, and he used settlement checks for unintended purposes. <em>Id. </em>at 696, 919 A.2d at 673.</p>\n<p id=\"b101-7\">The monitor also reported that the attorney maintained inaccurate settlement sheets with minimal accounting records, failed to maintain a ledger, and routinely \u201cpost dated check[s] to accommodate clients.\u201d <em>Id. </em>at 697, 919 A.2d at 673. The attorney also conceded that he failed to reconcile his account on a monthly basis and left Personal Insurance Protection funds in the account to cover fees. <em>Id. </em>As a result of the attorney\u2019s misconduct and non-compliance, the CDA was subsequently revoked. <em>Id. </em>at 695, 919 A.2d at 672.</p>\n<p id=\"b101-8\">This Court upheld the conclusions of the hearing judge relative to violations of MLRPC 1.15, 8.4(a), and Md. Rules <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"70\">*70</page-number>16-604 and 16-607. However, we further concluded that the attorney also violated Md. Rule 16-609 and Bus. Occ. and Prof. \u00a7 10-306, given that both rules related to the attorney\u2019s misuse of his escrow account, <em>see id. </em>at 700, 919 A.2d at 675, as well as MLRPC 8.4(d), because his conduct was \u201cprejudicial to the administration of justice.\u201d <em>Id. </em>at 701, 919 A.2d at 676.</p>\n<p id=\"b102-5\">In ordering indefinite suspension with the right to apply for readmission after ninety-days, this Court determined that the attorney\u2019s prior opportunity to remediate his conduct under the CDA was particularly relevant. We reasoned:</p>\n<blockquote id=\"b102-6\">[Mba-Jonas] was afforded the opportunity of a conditional diversion agreement. That agreement was terminated when the monitor charged with checking and keeping an eye on [his] escrow account, signaled a problem and it was learned that [he] had not changed his accounting practices .... Moreover, we are satisfied that [an indefinite suspension] should require [Mba-Jonas] to demonstrate lessons learned and, critically, that the sloppiness [<footnotemark>20</footnotemark>] which has characterized his handling of his escrow account will no longer obtain.</blockquote>\n<p id=\"b102-7\"><em>Id. </em>at 690, 703-04, 919 A.2d at 677.</p>\n<p id=\"b102-8\">We subsequently readdressed the attorney\u2019s misconduct in <em>Mba-Jonas II, </em>402 Md. 334, 936 A.2d 839 (2007). In that matter, the attorney continued to mismanage his escrow account by incurring negative balances and overdrafts, withdrawing more funds from the account than what was received into same, and used funds directed for one client matter in other matters on four occasions. <em>Id. </em>at 339-40, 936 A.2d at 841-42. As a result, we upheld the hearing judge\u2019s conclusions that the attorney violated MLRPC 1.15, 8.4(a) and (d), and Md. Rules 16-607, 16-609, and Bus. Occ. and Prof. \u00a7 10-306. <em>Id. </em>at 340-46, 936 A.2d at 842-46.</p>\n<p id=\"b103-4\"><page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"71\">*71</page-number>We also acknowledged the hearing judge\u2019s conclusion that the attorney violated MLRPC 8.1 by failing to respond to Bar Counsel\u2019s request for an explanation regarding the overdrafts in his escrow account on three occasions, then subsequently responded to Bar Counsel with a letter that was \u201ctotally non-responsive.\u201d <em>Id. </em>at 339, 936 A.2d at 842. Given the overlap in the time between the two disciplinary matters and the substantially similar violations involved, we considered the attorney\u2019s present conduct, including his prior violations in <em>MbaJonas I, </em>as a whole. <em>Id. </em>at 346, 936 A.2d at 846.</p>\n<p id=\"b103-5\">In determining the attorney\u2019s sanction, we emphasized the absence of intentional deceit or dishonesty in the attorney\u2019s misconduct. Thus, recounting the hearing judge\u2019s findings in both <em>Mbar-Jonas I and Mba-Jonas II, </em>we stated:</p>\n<blockquote id=\"b103-6\">Neither of the actions against Mba-Jonas involves an intent to defraud, deceive, or steal from his clients. [The hearing judge] found in the previous case that \u2018[cjlearly, he had no intent to defraud or steal from his clients. In fact, many of his problems resulted from his desire to accommodate his clients and to keep them satisfied with his representation.\u2019 Likewise, in the present matter, [the hearing judge] found that the \u2018[c]ourt does not believe \u2014 nor has it been suggested \u2014 that the state of [Mba-Jonas\u2019s] escrow account is the result of dishonesty, fraud, deceit or misrepresentation.\u2019</blockquote>\n<p id=\"AVj\"><em>Id. </em>at 346-47, 936 A.2d at 846 (internal citation omitted). As a result, we ordered a continuation of his indefinite suspension with the right to apply for readmission after six months. <em>Id. </em>at 349, 936 A.2d at 847.</p>\n<p id=\"b103-7\">Bar Counsel submits that \u201cRespondent\u2019s case is more significant than <em>Mbo-Jonas I </em>in that, she received two CD As and had numerous trust account violations.\u201d In comparison to <em>Mbar-Jonas II, </em>Bar Counsel posits that based upon Respondent\u2019s \u201cnumerous Rule violations and conduct surrounding Ms. Sewell-Carpenter\u2019s case\u201d she should receive a sanction similar to the attorney in <em>Mbar-Jonas II.</em></p>\n<p id=\"b103-8\">We agree. Although Respondent\u2019s misconduct and resulting Rule violations bear resemblance to that of the attorney in <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"72\">*72</page-number><em>Mbctr-Jonas I, </em>the instant matter is distinguishable because Respondent had the benefit of two CDAs to remediate the exact misconduct that precipitated the charges against her. Additionally, the evidence demonstrated that Respondent repeatedly failed to respond to Ms. Deady\u2019s and Bar Counsel\u2019s requests for information during this time. Although this is unlike the circumstances in <em>Mba-Jonas I, </em>where we ordered indefinite suspension with the right to apply for readmission after ninety-days, it is akin to the attorney\u2019s failure to adequately respond to Bar Counsel\u2019s requests in <em>Mbctr-Jonas II, </em>where, in addition to several trust account violations, we determined that an indefinite suspension with the right to apply for readmission after six months was warranted.</p>\n<p id=\"b104-4\">We also acknowledge that the circumstances in the instant matter are similar to <em>Mbctr-Jonas I </em>and <em>Mbctr-Jonas II, </em>where the hearing judge concluded that the attorney\u2019s misconduct was not due to intentional dishonesty or deceit, but \u201csloppiness.\u201d Here, the hearing judge did not find that Respondent\u2019s misconduct was a product of intentional dishonesty or deceit, but instead, was due to ignorance of trust account rules, poor law office management, and her illness.</p>\n<p id=\"b104-5\">Nonetheless, in determining the appropriate sanction for Respondent\u2019s misconduct, we must also consider the aggravating and mitigating factors. Pursuant to Standard 9.22 of the American Bar Association Standards for Imposing Lawyer Sanctions, this Court has recognized the following aggravating factors in attorney disciplinary cases:</p>\n<blockquote id=\"b104-6\">(a) prior disciplinary offenses; (b) dishonest or selfish motive; (c) a pattern of misconduct; (d) multiple offenses; (e) bad faith obstruction of the disciplinary proceeding by intentionally failing to comply with rules or orders of the disciplinary agency; (f) submission of false evidence, false statements, or other deceptive practices during the disciplinary process; (g) refusal to acknowledge wrongful nature of conduct; (h) vulnerability of victim; (i) substantial experience in the practice of law; (j) indifference to making restitution.</blockquote>\n<p id=\"b105-3\"><page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"73\">*73</page-number><em>See Attorney Grievance Comm\u2019n v. Bleecker, </em>414 Md. 147, 176-77, 994 A.2d 928, 945-46 (2010). This Court also recognizes the following mitigating factors:</p>\n<blockquote id=\"b105-4\">[A]bsence of a prior disciplinary record; absence of a dishonest or selfish motive; personal or emotional problems; timely good faith efforts to make restitution or to rectify consequences of misconduct; full and free disclosure to disciplinary board or cooperative attitude toward proceedings; inexperience in the practice of law; character or reputation; physical or mental disability or impairment; delay in disciplinary proceedings; interim rehabilitation; imposition of other penalties or sanctions; remorse; and finally, remoteness of prior offenses.</blockquote>\n<p id=\"b105-5\"><em>Attorney Grievance Comm\u2019n v. Coppola, </em>419 Md. 370, 407, 19 A.3d 431, 453 (2011).</p>\n<p id=\"b105-6\">The hearing judge acknowledged that despite Respondent\u2019s illness during the period of 2014 \u2014 when she conceded to having no safeguards in place to check mail or her attorney trust account during recuperation from surgery \u2014 she still had a professional obligation to protect her clients. The hearing judge also concluded that Respondent\u2019s illness does not explain her \u201cuncooperative behavior\u201d towards Mr. Karr, Ms. Deady, and Bar Counsel. The hearing judge expressed concern regarding Respondent\u2019s testimony on July 14, 2015, stating:</p>\n<blockquote id=\"b105-7\">[Respondent] represented that the reason she felt a sense of urgency in February of 2013 for Ms. Sewell[-Carpenter] to file a post-judgment motion was that she believed she had to file the motion within ninety days. However, in her letter dated August 10, 2015, Respondent stated that she only testified to that because she heard a \u2018more experienced\u2019 attorney tell her that, and she thought she would throw it \u2018in the pot\u2019 in her disciplinary case before this [c]ourt. It is therefore not clear to this [c]ourt of the extent to which Respondent was being completely forthright in her testimony on July 14, 2015.</blockquote>\n<p id=\"b106-4\"><page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"74\">*74</page-number>Nonetheless, the hearing judge acknowledged Respondent\u2019s surgery and period of recuperation in early 2014 as a mitigating factor, despite the fact that Respondent submitted limited documentation<footnotemark>21</footnotemark> evidencing her medical conditions for the time period apart from her testimony concerning her health condition.<footnotemark>22</footnotemark></p>\n<p id=\"b106-5\">A CDA generally serves as a remedial tool to assist attorneys\u2019 compliance with the Maryland Rules and Rules of Professional Conduct. Thus, we share in Bar Counsel\u2019s concern that Respondent\u2019s failure to adhere to the terms under the CDA and Amended CDA, while continuing to engage in conduct which precipitated her CDA, demonstrates a lack of appreciation of the problem.</p>\n<p id=\"b106-6\">While we accept the mitigating factor of Respondent\u2019s illness during the relevant period, it does not excuse her admitted ignorance of trust account rules; her failure to remediate her misconduct or adhere to the protocols under consecutive CDAs; her lack of cooperation with Ms. Deady and Bar Counsel while under investigation; or her failure to implement safeguards during an illness or otherwise protect her clients\u2019 interests in conformance with the foregoing Rules. Although, during oral argument, Respondent admitted to experiencing difficulties as her mother\u2019s caretaker until her death, which may have also impacted her practice, we could <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"75\">*75</page-number>not ascertain whether this was shared with Bar Counsel or the hearing judge. Accordingly, we order Respondent indefinitely suspended with the right to apply for readmission after six months.</p>\n<p id=\"b107-5\">IT IS SO ORDERED; RESPONDENT SHALL PAY ALL COSTS AS TAXED BY THE CLERK OF THIS COURT, INCLUDING COSTS OF ALL TRANSCRIPTS, PURSUANT TO MD.

On that same day, Mr. Fleming signed Respondent\u2019s retainer agreement and agreed to pay a $1500 non-refundable retainer. Although Respondent initiated <em>pro hac vice </em>admission to the North Carolina bar, she did not complete the process because she had no record that the retainer had been paid. Respondent did not maintain trust account records or advise Mr. Fleming of the status of his case. Respondent communicated with the General Court on two occasions, but never entered an appearance on Mr. Fleming\u2019s behalf. Respondent contended that she did not seek <em>pro hac vice </em>admission because Mr. Fleming did not pay the full $1,500 retainer. In reliance on Respondent\u2019s representation, Mr. Fleming did not seek other counsel and missed his scheduled hearing in the General Court.</p>\n</footnote>\n<footnote label=\"6\">\n<p id=\"b77-8\">. On November 20, 2013, Respondent informed Ms. Deady that she had not prepared the requested documents because she had new clients and \"had to attend to their cases.\u201d Respondent was also unable to meet with Ms. Deady on November 22, 2013 after being requested to do so.</p>\n</footnote>\n<footnote label=\"7\">\n<p id=\"b78-10\">.

In her exceptions, Respondent contends that while it is understood that she did not meet with Ms. Deady except for one time, there is a significant mitigating circumstance that established that her conduct was not willful. Specifically, that there were several instances in which she and Ms. Deady requested extension of time to prepared reports that were denied by Bar Counsel. We conclude that this contention does not mitigate her misconduct and overrule her exception. The evidence demonstrates that Respondent's Amended CDA was revoked for noncompliance, which included, in substantial part, her failure to meet with Ms. Deady, or otherwise adhere to the protocols as agreed under the CDA.</p>\n</footnote>\n</opinion>\n</casebody>\n",
