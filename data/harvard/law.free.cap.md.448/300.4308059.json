For the reasons that follow, we answer that question in the affirmative.</p>\n<p id=\"b334-8\">I.</p>\n<p id=\"b334-9\">On April 16, 2010, Petitioner, Cynthia Keller-Bee, appeared in the District Court of Maryland sitting in Harford County pursuant to an order requiring her to show cause why she had not answered post-judgment interrogatories in an action in which judgment had been entered against her. For an unknown reason, the judgment creditor did not appear at that hearing, causing the court to dismiss the show cause order.</p>\n<p id=\"b334-10\">Ironically, nine months later, the judgment creditor filed a motion requesting that Petitioner be found in contempt for her alleged failure to appear at the hearing on April 16, 2010, and seeking a body attachment against her.<footnotemark>1</footnotemark> The Administrative Judge for the District Court signed the body attachment. On the morning of January 27, 2011, it was executed upon Peti<page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"303\">*303</page-number>tioner and she was taken into custody. That same afternoon, Petitioner was brought before a Court Commissioner who released her on her own recognizance with the advisement that she would receive notice of a court date to address her alleged failure to appear.</p>\n<p id=\"b335-5\">On February 4, 2011, Petitioner went to the District Court Clerk\u2019s Office to ask why she had been arrested and detained. Following that office\u2019s investigation, Petitioner was advised that she should not have been arrested because she had appeared at the hearing as ordered and, for that reason, she would not need to appear again in court.</p>\n<p id=\"b335-6\">On December 27, 2013, Petitioner filed in the Circuit Court for Baltimore City a two-count complaint against the State of Maryland. The complaint alleged \u201cnegligence and malfeasance of one or more of the State\u2019s employees in the District Court System for Harford County in presenting body attachment papers to [the Administrative Judge] for signage and issuance.\u201d Count I alleged that \u201cdrafting and or presenting body attachment papers to [the judge] for issuance of the same\u201d constituted negligence on the part of some unnamed \u201cemployee/agent or employees/agents\u201d of the District Court of Maryland. Count II alleged that those same acts violated Petitioner\u2019s rights under Article 24 of the Maryland Declaration of Rights. Petitioner further alleged that \u201cshe was harmed and lost her liberty\u201d and \u201cexperienced severe mental anguish, pain and suffering, loss of freedom, liberty, and/or other recoverable losses and damages associated with the violation of her rights.\u201d</p>\n<p id=\"b335-7\">The State moved to dismiss the complaint on the ground of absolute judicial immunity. Following a hearing, the Circuit Court denied the motion. While noting that a clerk would be entitled to the defense of absolute judicial immunity if acting at the direction or under the supervision of a judge, the Circuit Court questioned whether the clerk was acting with such authority based upon the time that had elapsed between Petitioner\u2019s appearance in court and the clerk\u2019s generating the body attachment.</p>\n<p id=\"b336-4\"><page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"304\">*304</page-number>The State appealed the denial of the motion to dismiss. The Court of Special Appeals, in a reported opinion, reversed the judgment of the Circuit Court.<footnotemark>2</footnotemark> <em>State v. Keller-Bee, </em>224 Md.App. 1, 3, 119 A.3d 80 (2015). Observing that \u201cabsolute judicial immunity attaches to the function and not the person,\u201d <em>id. </em>at 11, 119 A.3d 80, the intermediate appellate court agreed with the State that the action complained of was the judge\u2019s judicial act of signing the body attachment, rather than any action by court personnel in presenting the body attachment to the judge for signature or thereafter transmitting the signed body attachment to the sheriff for execution. <em>Id. </em>at 6, 119 A.3d 80 (\u201cThe harm [Petitioner] alleges emanated from the judge\u2019s issuance of the warrant. It is this judicial function that is really the subject of [her] tort claim.\u201d). The Court of Special Appeals added that \u201cpresentment of warrants to judges for approval and signature is a task that regularly occurs during the performance of a clerk\u2019s employment,\u201d and therefore \u201cthe issuance of arrest warrants is a judicial act.\u201d <em>Id. </em>at 13, 119 A.3d 80.</p>\n<p id=\"b336-5\">Petitioner filed a petition for writ of certiorari, which asked us to decide:</p>\n<blockquote id=\"b336-6\">Whether the Court of Special Appeals properly found that District Court clericals who are neither supervised by a Judge or State\u2019s Attorney nor directed to take certain actions by a Judge or State\u2019s Attorney are entitled to absolute judicial immunity for negligent torts which result in injury to a citizen? [<footnotemark>3</footnotemark>]</blockquote>\n<p id=\"b337-4\"><page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"305\">*305</page-number>We granted the petition, <em>Keller-Bee v. State, </em>445 Md. 487, 128 A.3d 51 (2015), and affirm the judgment of the Court of Special Appeals, but do so without regard to whether the clerk was supervised or directed to take certain actions by a judge. Instead, we hold that Petitioner\u2019s claims against the State of Maryland are barred by absolute judicial immunity because the clerk\u2019s role in transmitting the application for a body attachment to the judge for signature was not the proximate cause of Petitioner\u2019s wrongful arrest. Rather, the judge\u2019s act of signing the body attachment caused Petitioner\u2019s injury, and that act is protected by absolute judicial immunity.</p>\n<p id=\"b337-5\">II.</p>\n<p id=\"b337-6\">\u201cThe principle that judicial officers should be immune from all civil liability for their judicial acts has been part of the common law since very early days.\u201d <em>Parker v. State, </em>337 Md. 271, 277, 653 A.2d 436 (1995). The doctrine of absolute judicial immunity bars civil suits against judges \u201cfor acts done by them in the exercise of their judicial functions.\u201d <em>Id. </em>at 280, 653 A.2d 436 (quoting <em>Bradley v. Fisher, </em>80 U.S. 335, 347, 13 Wall. 335, 20 L.Ed. 646 (1872)). The reasoning behind the doctrine is sound: for judges to exercise fully the independent judgment and discretion vested to them in furtherance of the administration of justice, they must rest assured that they will not be exposed to liability to \u201ceveryone who might feel himself aggrieved\u201d by the judges\u2019 decisions. <em>Id. </em>at 281, 653 A.2d 436 (quoting <em>Bradley, </em>80 U.S. at 347). Thus, \u201ca judge who has a general judicial authority to perform the kinds of acts for which he is sued is absolutely immune from civil liability for those acts.\u201d <em>Id. </em>at 282, 653 A.2d 436. The only exception to the broad grant of absolute immunity is if an act is performed when \u201cthere is clearly no jurisdiction over the subject-matter\u201d and \u201cthe want of jurisdiction is known to the judge.\u201d <em>Bradley, </em>80 U.S. at 351-52.</p>\n<p id=\"b338-4\"><page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"306\">*306</page-number>The State advances two alternative theories for why Petitioner\u2019s suit is barred by the doctrine of absolute judicial immunity. The State first points out that issuance of a body attachment is a \u201cjudicial act\u201d protected by judicial immunity and, as such, \u201c \u2018cannot form the basis of a recovery against the State under the Tort Claims Act.\u2019 \u201d (Quoting <em>Parker, </em>337 Md. at 286, 653 A.2d 436). The State argues that, \u201cbecause the gravamen of Ms. Keller-Bee\u2019s complaint consists of harm she claims to have suffered from [the judge\u2019s] issuance of the body attachment \u2014 a judicial act protected by judicial immunity\u2014 this suit against the State is barred by the rule recognized in <em>Parker.\u201d </em>It therefore follows, the State further argues, that, \u201cto uphold the dismissal of the complaint brought against the State based on absolute judicial immunity, this Court need not look beyond the but-for cause of Ms. Keller-Bee\u2019s injury, which was [the judge\u2019s] judicial act of issuing the body attachment.\u201d</p>\n<p id=\"b338-5\">The State argues, in the alternative, that \u201cjudicial immunity extends beyond judges to protect other individuals whose public duties are \u2018necessary to the proper administration of justice,\u2019 \u201d (quoting <em>D\u2019Aoust v. Diamond, </em>424 Md. 549, 598, 36 A.3d 941 (2012)), and that \u201c \u2018those individuals, when performing tasks that are integral to the judicial process, enjoy the same immunity that is applicable to the judges,\u2019 \u201d (quoting <em>Gill v. Ripley, </em>352 Md. 754, 771, 724 A.2d 88 (1999)). For both arguments, the State relies on the settled proposition that it is \u201cthe nature of the function performed, not the identity of the actor who performed it,\u201d that drives the immunity analysis. <em>See Forrester v. White, </em>484 U.S. 219, 229, 108 S.Ct. 538, 98 L.Ed.2d 555 (1988).</p>\n<p id=\"b338-6\">Petitioner accepts the general proposition that judicial immunity applies not only to acts performed by judges in carrying out their judicial duties but also to those judiciary personnel \u201cwho act under the direction of a judge or who implement judicial orders of one kind or another.\u201d (Quoting <em>Gill, </em>352 Md. at 771, 724 A.2d 88). She argues, however, that our case law does not provide \u201ca blanket extension of judicial immunity to all [clerks] in the District Court Clerks\u2019 offices.\u201d <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"307\">*307</page-number>Consequently, \u201cthe clerk who initiated the process that led to [Petitioner\u2019s] wrongful arrest and incarceration does not have such protection.\u201d</p>\n<p id=\"b339-5\">We need not resolve the parties\u2019 dispute over whether judicial immunity covers the acts of the unnamed District Court clerk or clerks who prepared the body attachment for the Administrative Judge\u2019s signature, as it is clear to us that the judicial act that was the direct and proximate cause of Petitioner\u2019s alleged injury was the judge\u2019s issuance of the body attachment directing that Petitioner be taken into custody.</p>\n<p id=\"b339-6\">III.</p>\n<p id=\"b339-7\">In <em>Parker, </em>we were presented with the question of whether a judge was entitled to absolute judicial immunity for improperly issuing an arrest warrant. 337 Md. at 274, 653 A.2d 436. Much like in this case, the sheriffs requested an arrest warrant for Doris Parker\u2019s \u201ccontinued\u201d failure to pay a fine for a speeding offense when, in actuality, Ms. Parker had been acquitted of that offense. <em>Id. </em>A judge \u201cissued the warrant without calling for the case file from the clerk\u2019s office or reviewing the docket entries,\u201d which would have alerted the judge to Ms. Parker\u2019s acquittal. <em>Id. </em>Ms. Parker filed an action against the judge and the clerks in the circuit court from which the warrant was issued for false imprisonment, false arrest, and negligence. <em>Id. </em>at 275, 653 A.2d 436. The circuit court granted the clerks\u2019 motion to dismiss \u201cbecause the clerks played no part in the issuance of the warrant.\u201d <em>Id. </em>The circuit court further granted the judge\u2019s motion to dismiss because he was entitled to absolute judicial immunity, which also precluded an action against the State. <em>Id. </em>Before the Court of Special Appeals and before us, Ms. Parker appealed only the dismissal of her claims against the judge and the State. <em>Id. </em>at 276, 653 A.2d 436. We noted in a footnote that Ms. Parker \u201chas not challenged on appeal the dismissal of the claims based on the alleged tortious acts of the clerks,\u201d and we accordingly confined the issue before us to the claim against the judge and the State. <em>Id. </em>at 276 n. 3, 653 A.2d 436.</p>\n<p id=\"b340-4\"><page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"308\">*308</page-number>We affirmed the judgments of the Court of Special Appeals and the circuit court, concluding that judges are absolutely immune from civil suit for all acts within the scope of their jurisdiction. <em>Id. </em>at 284, 287, 653 A.2d 436. We held that the judge in Ms. Parker\u2019s case was entitled to absolute judicial immunity because \u201c[t]he issuance of arrest warrants is the type of judicial activity performed by a circuit judge, and is therefore, in the most general sense, a matter within the jurisdiction of the circuit judge. In issuing the warrant, [the judge] was performing a judicial act.\u201d <em>Id. </em>at 287, 653 A.2d 436.</p>\n<p id=\"b340-5\">Petitioner does not seem to contest that the issuance of the body attachment in this case was a judicial act.<footnotemark>4</footnotemark> Rather, as noted, she argues principally that applying judicial immunity in this case is not appropriate because our cases have not expressly extended the doctrine to acts taken by clerical employees not directly supervised by a judge. Petitioner relies heavily upon the footnote in <em>Parker, </em>in which we noted that the question of a courtroom clerk\u2019s judicial immunity was not before us because that issue had not been appealed. According to Petitioner, that we chose not to address whether a clerk would have been entitled to immunity \u201cspeaks volumes\u201d and \u201cwould strongly suggest the clerks at issue herein were not automatically entitled to absolute immunity.\u201d</p>\n<p id=\"b340-6\">Petitioner asserts that the unidentified clerk should be held responsible because he or she \u201cnegligently failed to note [Petitioner\u2019s] appearance and then negligently forwarded the file to the judge\u2019s chambers for issuance.\u201d Petitioner also hypothesizes that, \u201ceven after [the judge] signed the order, the clerk\u2019s office had one additional chance to catch the error but failed to do so,\u201d and the judge \u201cwould have appreciated <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"309\">*309</page-number>the error being caught before the order went to the sheriff.\u201d Although implicitly acknowledging that the order would have no legal significance without the judge\u2019s signature, Petitioner argues that the clerk nevertheless had an independent responsibility to determine the merits of the request for a body attachment because \u201ca judge can and must rely on the employees who work with or for her or him not to allow the judge to make an obvious error in carrying out his or her duties.\u201d</p>\n<p id=\"b341-4\">Petitioner\u2019s concession that it is the <em>judge </em>who made the error is fatal to her claim. We need not decide in this case whether clerical employees are entitled to absolute judicial immunity to the same extent as judges, or even whether the clerk at issue here was acting at the direction or under the supervision of a judge, because the clerk did not cause Petitioner\u2019s injury. Petitioner\u2019s complaint alleges that the erroneously-issued body attachment was \u201cthe result of the negligence and malfeasance of one or more of the State\u2019s employees in the District Court System for Harford County in presenting body attachment papers to [the judge] for signage and issuance.\u201d Implicit in that allegation, however, is the acknowledgement that the judge\u2019s act of signing and issuing the body attachment was the act that caused Petitioner\u2019s injury, not whatever action by a clerk preceded the judge\u2019s signature. We agree with the State that \u201cthe true source of Ms. Keller-Bee\u2019s grievance and injury is the issuance of the body attachment by [the judge], unquestionably !a judicial act\u2019 subject to absolute judicial immunity.\u201d</p>\n<p id=\"b341-5\">In short, this case begins and ends with our conclusion in <em>Parker </em>that the issuance of an arrest warrant is a judicial act that is shielded from civil liability by absolute judicial immunity. <em>See </em>337 Md. at 287, 653 A.2d 436. Although Petitioner, evidently recognizing that a suit against the judge would be unsuccessful, has attempted to shift the blame to the unidentified clerk who generated the body attachment and presented it to the judge, there is no dispute that the body attachment would not have led to Petitioner\u2019s arrest absent the judge\u2019s signature. The judge\u2019s issuance of the body attachment was <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"310\">*310</page-number>therefore the operative act that caused Petitioner\u2019s wrongful arrest. Because we are concerned with \u201cthe nature of the function performed, not the identity of the actor who performed it,\u201d <em>Forrester, </em>484 U.S. at 229, 108 S.Ct. 538, it matters not that Petitioner has chosen to bring an action against the clerk instead of the judge. The act that caused Petitioner to be wrongfully arrested is a judicial act that is entitled to absolute judicial immunity. <em>See Foster v. Walsh, </em>864 F.2d 416, 417 (6th Cir.1988) (\u201cMost courts that have addressed this issue have held that a clerk who issues a warrant at the direction of a judge is performing a function to which absolute immunity attaches.\u201d).</p>\n<p id=\"b342-5\">It is elementary tort law that a motion to dismiss a negligence claim should be granted if the plaintiff cannot establish that the injury alleged was proximately caused by the negligent act. <em>See Pittway Corp. v. Collins, </em>409 Md. 218, 243, 973 A.2d 771 (2009) (\u201cIt is a basic principle that \u2018[njegligence is not actionable unless it is a proximate cause of the harm alleged.\u2019 \u201d (alteration in original) (quoting <em>Stone v. Chicago Title Ins. Co., </em>330 Md. 329, 337, 624 A.2d 496 (1993))). Because the clerk\u2019s act of forwarding the request for a body attachment to the judge was not the proximate cause of Petitioner\u2019s injury, Petitioner\u2019s complaint fails to state a claim upon which relief can be granted. For that reason, the State\u2019s motion to dismiss should have been granted. <em>See Ford v. Kenosha County, </em>160 Wis.2d 485, 466 N.W.2d 646, 652 (1991) (affirming an order dismissing an action against a clerk who \u201cnegligently prepared the bench warrant and negligently submitted it to the assistant district attorney\u201d because \u201c[s]uch action could only become effective when accepted and signed by the judge, thus making it a judicial act\u201d); <em>cf. White v. Gerbitz, </em>892 F.2d 457, 463 (6th Cir.1989) (concluding that the district court properly dismissed negligence claims against a clerk who failed to apply the proper procedure for appointing a special city judge because the conduct \u201cwas not the proximate cause of [the plaintiffs] incarceration\u201d). We therefore affirm the judgment of the Court of Special Appeals.</p>\n<p id=\"b343-4\"><page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"311\">*311</page-number>JUDGMENT OF THE COURT OF SPECIAL APPEALS AFFIRMED; COSTS TO BE PAID BY PETITIONER.</p>\n<footnote label=\"1\">\n<p id=\"b334-12\">. A body attachment is defined as</p>\n<blockquote id=\"b334-13\">a written order issued by a court directing a sheriff or peace officer to take custody of and bring before the court (1) a witness who fails to comply with a subpoena, (2) a material witness in a criminal action, or (3) a party in a civil action who fails to comply with an order of court.</blockquote>\n<p id=\"b334-14\">Md. Rule 1-202(c).</p>\n</footnote>\n<footnote label=\"2\">\n<p id=\"b336-7\">. The State relied on the collateral order doctrine in noting an immediate appeal. Petitioner filed a motion to dismiss the appeal on the ground that the Circuit Court\u2019s order did not come within the collateral order doctrine. The Court of Special Appeals denied the motion. Petitioner has not challenged that decision of the Court of Special Appeals.</p>\n</footnote>\n<footnote label=\"3\">\n<p id=\"b336-8\">. Petitioner also raised a second question, asking the Court \u201d[w]hether the Court of Special Appeals failed to adequately and properly follow this Court's decision in <em>Parker v. State, </em>337 Md. 271, 653 A.2d 436 (1995), which held that a judge was entitled to absolute judicial immunity but expressly left open the question of whether district court clerks <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"305\">*305</page-number>were also entitled to such immunity?\u201d The answer to this question will be subsumed within our resolution of the first question.</p>\n</footnote>\n<footnote label=\"4\">\n<p id=\"b340-7\">. It is well settled that an order directing court officers to bring an individual before the court is a judicial act. <em>Mireles v. Waco, </em>502 U.S. 9, 12, 112 S.Ct. 286, 116 L.Ed.2d 9 (1991). We see no difference in this context between the body attachment issued here and an arrest warrant, the issuance of which our cases have established constitutes a judicial act. <em>E.g., D\u2019Aoust v. Diamond, </em>424 Md. 549, 599, 36 A.3d 941 (2012); <em>Davis v. DiPino, </em>337 Md. 642, 652-53, 655 A.2d 401 (1995).</p>\n</footnote>\n</opinion>\n</casebody>\n",
