Code Ann., Lab. &amp; Empl. (1991, 2008 Repl. Vol.) (\u201cLE\u201d) \u00a7\u00a7 9-101 to 9-1201, a \u201ccovered employee\u201d is entitled to compensation from his or her employer for an accidental personal injury. <em>See </em>LE \u00a7 9 \u2014 501(a)(1) (\u201cExcept as otherwise provided, each employer of a covered employee shall provide compensation in accordance with this title to[] the covered employee for an accidental personal injury sustained by the covered employee[.]\u201d (Paragraph break omitted)). Pursuant to LE \u00a7 9-227(b), for purposes of workers\u2019 compensation, \u201c[a] sole proprietor may elect to be a covered employee if the proprietor devotes full time to the business of the proprietorship.\u201d In other words, under certain circumstances, a sole proprietor may elect to be a \u201ccovered employee\u201d for purposes of workers\u2019 compensation. Under the Act, the amount of <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"255\">*255</page-number>compensation that is due to a \u201ccovered employee\u201d who \u201chas a permanent total disability resulting from an accidental personal injury\u201d is based on the covered employee\u2019s \u201caverage weekly wage\u201d (\u201cAWW\u201d). LE \u00a7 9-637(a)(l). Specifically, the amount of compensation that is due to the covered employee in such a circumstance is two-thirds of the covered employee\u2019s AWW, provided that the AWW does not exceed the State\u2019s AWW or equal less than $25. <em>See </em>LE \u00a7 9-637(a)(l).</p>\n<p id=\"b287-4\">This case involves a matter of first impression in Maryland \u2014 namely, how to calculate the AWW of a sole proprietor who has elected coverage under the Act. Specifically, we must decide whether the AWW of a sole proprietor who elects coverage under the Act should be calculated based on the sole proprietorship\u2019s gross receipts or gross income (without deducting business expenses)<footnotemark>1</footnotemark> or net profit (the gross receipts less business expenses). We hold that the AWW of a sole proprietor who elects coverage under the Act is to be calculated based on the sole proprietorship\u2019s net profit, not on the sole proprietorship\u2019s gross receipts or gross income. The sole proprietorship\u2019s net profit is the best approximation of the earnings that a sole proprietor actually takes home because net profit does not include the sole proprietorship\u2019s business costs and expenses.</p>\n<p id=\"b287-5\">BACKGROUND</p>\n<p id=\"b287-6\">Patrick Long (\u201cLong\u201d), Petitioner, is the self-employed sole proprietor and owner of Long\u2019s Floor Works (\u201cthe Employer\u201d). Before 2011, Long elected to obtain workers\u2019 compensation coverage as a covered employee. In 2011, Long was working as a subcontractor for Ryan Floors, Incorporated. Ryan Floors, Incorporated paid the Employer based on the number of hours that Long worked. In July 2011, Long injured his back while installing carpet during the course of his employment. Long\u2019s injury required surgery, and, accord<page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"256\">*256</page-number>ing to Long\u2019s counsel, Long is likely \u201cgoing to be disabled for life.\u201d</p>\n<p id=\"b288-4\">Almost six months later, on January 23, 2012, Long filed with the Workers\u2019 Compensation Commission (\u201cthe Commission\u201d) a \u201cNotice of Employee\u2019s Claim,\u201d seeking workers\u2019 compensation benefits. On July 16, 2012, the Commission conducted a hearing on Long\u2019s claim. On July 19, 2012, the Commission issued an \u201cAward of Compensation,\u201d finding that: (1) Long \u201csustained an accidental injury arising out of and in the course of his employment\u201d; (2) Long\u2019s disability was the result of the work-related accidental injury; (3) Long was temporarily totally disabled from August 20, 2011 to September 20, 2011, and from November 1, 2011 \u201cto the present and continuing\u201d; (4) Long was temporarily partially disabled from September 21, 2011 to October 31, 2011; (5) the authorization for medical treatment as recommended by Long\u2019s doctor was allowed; (6) the insurer, the Injured Workers\u2019 Insurance Fund (\u201cIWIF\u201d), Respondent,<footnotemark>2</footnotemark> and the Employer would pay causally-related medical expenses as stipulated by the Commission\u2019s Medical Fee Guide; and (7) Long\u2019s AWW was $1,500, \u201csubject to verification.\u201d Accordingly, based on its findings, the Commission ordered that IWIF and the Employer compensate Long for temporary total disability for his past and continuing temporary total disability at a rate of $940 per week, and that IWIF and the Employer pay the causally-related medical expenses. The Commission also ordered IWIF and the Employer to compensate Long for his temporary partial disability at a rate of 50% of the difference <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"257\">*257</page-number>between Long\u2019s AWW \u201cand his wage[-]earning capacity in the same employment or otherwise if less than before the accident, but not to exceed fifty per centum of the State [AWW] for the period\u201d September 21, 2011 to October 31, 2011.</p>\n<p id=\"b289-4\">On July 28, 2012, Long filed with the Commission a \u201cRequest for Document Correction,\u201d asking that two \u201cerrors\u201d in the Commission\u2019s Award of Compensation be corrected. Specifically, Long asked that the Commission amend the date of the accidental injury from July 24, 2011 to July 31, 2011, as he had \u201camended the date of the accident at the hearing[.]\u201d Long also stated that the Commission\u2019s calculation of his AWW was incorrect, and asked that the Commission amend the AWW from $1,500 to $1,737.11 in accordance with a \u201cWage Statement\u201d that he attached to the Request for Document Correction. The attached Wage Statement demonstrated that Long had calculated his AWW to be $1,737.11 by adding his \u201cgross wages\u201d from the fourteen weeks preceding the injury, and dividing the total by fourteen. Long also attached a statement from Ryan Floors, Incorporated showing the Employer\u2019s gross receipts throughout 2011.</p>\n<p id=\"b289-5\">On August 7, 2012, the Commission issued an amended Award of Compensation, amending in its findings the date of the accidental injury from July 24, 2011 to July 31, 2011, and changing Long\u2019s AWW from $1,500 to $1,737.11. The Commission made no changes to any other aspects of the Award of Compensation. In other words, IWIF and the Employer were still required to compensate Long for temporary total disability at the rate of $940 per week and to compensate Long for temporary partial disability at a rate of 50% of the difference between Long\u2019s AWW \u201cand his wage[-]earning capacity in the same employment or otherwise if less than before the accident, but not to exceed fifty per centum of the State [AWW] for the period\u201d September 21, 2011 to October 31, 2011.</p>\n<p id=\"b289-6\">On August 16, 2012, IWIF filed with the Commission a motion for rehearing on the AWW amount, stating that Long\u2019s AWW should be $225.90, not $1,737.11. Almost one year later, on August 12, 2013, the Commission conducted a rehear<page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"258\">*258</page-number>ing on the amount of Long\u2019s AWW. During the rehearing, IWIF alleged that Long\u2019s \u201cgross wages\u201d in 2011 were between $11,000 and $12,000. IWIF based its figures on Schedule C of Long\u2019s 2010 federal income tax return,<footnotemark>3</footnotemark> which showed a net profit of $11,747, and IWIF\u2019s premium audit report for the Employer from May 2010 through May 2011, which showed Long\u2019s \u201cgross wages\u201d as $11,077.<footnotemark>4</footnotemark> IWIF argued that Long\u2019s AWW should be based on the Employer\u2019s net profit, which is the money that Long received after subtracting his business expenses from his gross receipts. IWIF\u2019s counsel noted that dividing the net profit of $11,747 by fifty-two, the number of weeks in a year, would yield an AWW of $225.90. Long responded that a calculation of his AWW had to be based on the Employer\u2019s gross receipts, not net profit, because gross receipts are the equivalent of gross wages for a sole proprietor. Indeed, Long argued that nothing under Maryland law supported calculating a sole proprietor\u2019s AWW based on net profit. Long further asserted that IWIF based its insurance premiums on the Employer\u2019s gross receipts, not on the Employer\u2019s net profit. IWIF replied that a self-employed individual\u2019s net profit essentially constitutes wages, as the net profit is the amount that the individual takes home after business expenses.</p>\n<p id=\"b290-4\">During the rehearing, various documents were submitted to the Commission. Schedule C of Long\u2019s 2010 federal income tax return showed the Employer\u2019s gross receipts as $88,748 and the Employer\u2019s net profit as $11,747. Long\u2019s 2011 federal individual income tax return (Form 1040), including Schedule C and Schedule SE (Self-Employment Tax), were also submitted. Long\u2019s 2011 federal individual income tax return stated that he received no wages. Line 12 of Long\u2019s 2011 federal individual income tax return, however, listed his business <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"259\">*259</page-number>income as $16,879, the figure that was identified in Schedule C and Schedule SE as the Employer\u2019s net profit.<footnotemark>5</footnotemark> Also in Schedule C of Long\u2019s 2011 federal income tax return, the Employer\u2019s gross receipts are shown as $44,606, and the total business expenses are shown as $27,727. Thus, the Employer\u2019s net profit was $16,879, which is the gross receipts of $44,606 less the business expenses of $27,727.<footnotemark>6</footnotemark></p>\n<p id=\"b291-4\">Also submitted was correspondence from IWIF to Long concerning the Employer\u2019s insurance premiums. For the policy that was effective from May 15, 2008 through May 15, 2009, one document showed an estimated premium of $2,196 based on an audited payroll of $36,900. Additionally, in response to a Premium Audit Report for the policy that was effective from May 15, 2010 through May 15, 2011, in a preprinted form dated May 23, 2011 \u2014 only two months before the accidental injury \u2014 Long stated that there was zero employee payroll and that his \u201cgross wages\u201d were $11,077.<footnotemark>7</footnotemark> Another document from IWIF dated March 16, 2012 showed that the premium for May 15, 2011 through May 15, 2012 was $2,416, and that the estimated renewal premium for May 15, 2012 through May 15, 2013 was $2,905, subject to an audit. And, in a letter dated May 15, 2012, as to the policy that was effective from May 15, 2011 through May 15, 2012, IWIF stated that the premium for the \u201cpolicy was based on your estimated payroll\u201d and that \u201c[t]he information provided on this Premium Audit Report will determine the proper premium based on the actual payroll.\u201d</p>\n<p id=\"b292-3\"><page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"260\">*260</page-number>On August 13, 2013, the Commission issued an order finding that Long\u2019s AWW was $496.44. The Commission explained its reasoning as follows:</p>\n<blockquote id=\"b292-4\">[Long] submitted his 2011 [federal individual] tax return. This document is the best evidence of the correct [AWW].</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b292-5\">[Long] earned a total of $16,879.00 in 2011. Previous Orders of the Commission reveal that [Long] only worked from 1/1/11 to 8/19/11 and was out of work for the remainder of the year[,] with the exception of a brief period when he worked part-time from 9/21/11 to 10/31/11.</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b292-6\">The period from 1/1/11 to 8/19/11 is 34 weeks.</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b292-7\">Thus, the correct [AWW] is $496.44[,] which was calculated by taking the full earnings for the year ($16,879.00) and dividing that figure by 34 weeks. The Commission recognizes that this number is slightly higher than the actual [AWW] because[,] to be precisely accurate[,] the amount earned while working from 9/21/11 to 10/31/11 should be deducted from the 2011 earnings before dividing by 34, but the Commission does not have that post-injury wage information available.</blockquote>\n<p id=\"b292-8\">On August 23, 2013, Long filed with the Commission a Request for Rehearing and a Motion for Rehearing as to the Commission\u2019s finding that his AWW was $496.44. In the motion, Long contended that the Commission erred in calculating his AWW based on his net profit because IWIF allegedly charged him an insurance premium \u201cbased upon his gross revenues or gross earnings and not his net profit[ ].\u201d (Underlining omitted). In other words, Long argued that his AWW should be calculated based on his gross receipts because that is the figure that IWIF supposedly used to determine his insurance premiums. According to Long, if IWIF could calculate his AWW based on his net profit, IWIF would receive a \u201cwindfall profit\u201d because IWIF \u201cwould be allowed to have collected premiums that bore no risk of loss.\u201d On September 4, 2013, the Commission denied the Request for Rehearing.</p>\n<p id=\"b292-9\">On September 12, 2013, Long filed a petition for judicial review in the Circuit Court for Montgomery County (\u201cthe <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"261\">*261</page-number>circuit court\u201d). On October 2, 2013, IWIF filed a response to the petition for judicial review. Thereafter, the parties filed cross-motions for summary judgment. Long attached to his motion for summary judgment a signed affidavit, in which he averred that an IWIF representative had told him that his insurance premium for the policy year beginning on May 15, 2012 \u201cwould be based upon [his] gross profit[ ] of $48,000.00.\u201d<footnotemark>8</footnotemark></p>\n<p id=\"b293-4\">On February 12, 2014, the circuit court conducted a hearing on the cross-motions for summary judgment. During the hearing, Long\u2019s counsel contended that Long\u2019s AWW should be calculated based on the Employer\u2019s gross income in the weeks preceding the accidental injury because that \u201cis how normal employees\u2019 [AWW]s are computed.\u201d Long\u2019s counsel argued, alternatively, that Long\u2019s AWW should be calculated based on the Employer\u2019s gross income because, before the accidental injury, IWIF allegedly based insurance premiums on the Employer\u2019s gross receipts. At the conclusion of the hearing, the circuit court orally granted IWIF\u2019s motion for summary judgment, thereby affirming the Commission\u2019s decision, and denied Long\u2019s motion for summary judgment. On the same day, the circuit court issued orders to the same effect.<footnotemark>9</footnotemark></p>\n<p id=\"b293-5\">On February 28, 2014, Long filed a notice of appeal. In a reported opinion dated September 30, 2015, the Court of Special Appeals affirmed the circuit court\u2019s judgment granting IWIF\u2019s motion for summary judgment and affirming the Commission\u2019s decision. <em>See Long v. Injured Workers\u2019 Ins. </em><page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"262\">*262</page-number><em>Fund, 225 </em>Md.App. 48, 72, 123 A.3d 562, 577 (2015). Specifically, the Court of Special Appeals held that a sole proprietor\u2019s \u201cgross wages\u201d and \u201cgross income\u201d are not synonymous, and that, under the circumstances of the case, \u201cthe Commission did not err in concluding that AWW should be based on Long\u2019s net profit[.]\u201d <em>Id. </em>at 57, 66, 123 A.3d at 568, 573. The Court of Special Appeals reasoned: \u201cTo disregard [Longj\u2019s business expenses in calculating the AWW of a sole proprietor would lead to an unjustifiably inflated AWW figure \u2014 a figure far higher than the economic advantage Long gained by working.\u201d <em>Id. </em>at 66, 123 A.3d at 573 (citation omitted). The Court of Special Appeals further rejected Long\u2019s alternative argument that, if insurance premiums are based on a sole proprietorship\u2019s gross income, then AWW must also be calculated on that basis. <em>See id. </em>at 66-67, 72, 123 A.3d 573, 576-77. As to that argument, the Court of Special Appeals stated: \u201cAdoption of such a rule in a case like the one at bar would result in a sole proprietor being able to recover an AWW far greater than the amount of money he or she was out-of-pocket as a result of not being able to work.\u201d <em>Id. </em>at 72, 123 A.3d at 577.</p>\n<p id=\"b294-4\">Long thereafter filed a petition for a writ of <em>certiorari, </em>which this Court granted on January 27, 2016. <em>See Long v. Injured Workers\u2019 Ins. Fund, </em>446 Md. 218, 130 A.3d 507 (2016).</p>\n<p id=\"b294-5\">DISCUSSION</p>\n<p id=\"Ame\">The Parties\u2019 Contentions</p>\n<p id=\"b294-6\">Long contends that the Commission incorrectly calculated his AWW because Maryland law requires that the AWW be based on his gross wages, or gross income, that were earned in the fourteen weeks preceding the accident. Long argues that Code of Maryland Regulation (\u201cCOMAR\u201d) 14.09.03.06 unambiguously requires that the AWW be calculated using gross wages, without regard to whether an individual is a regular employee who works for a separate employer or a self-employed sole proprietor. Long asserts that case law establishes a relationship between the premiums that are charged <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"263\">*263</page-number>by a workers\u2019 compensation insurer and the benefits that are paid to an injured insured, and that, as a result of that relationship, the AWW is to be based on the amount that is utilized by an insurer to calculate premiums. According to Long, the Commission disregarded this relationship when it calculated his AWW based on net profit instead of \u201cgross receipts/payroll.\u201d In other words, Long maintains that the AWW must be calculated on the same basis as insurance premiums are calculated \u2014 here, gross payroll.</p>\n<p id=\"b295-4\">Long further contends that, to the extent that the term \u201cgross wages\u201d in the context of a sole proprietor is ambiguous, such ambiguity must be construed in his favor to mean \u201cgross payroll.\u201d Long argues that he will not receive a windfall if his AWW is calculated based on his gross receipts because he paid insurance premiums based on his gross payroll. Long asserts that cases from other jurisdictions are largely distinguishable from this case, and maintains that certain other jurisdictions have rejected the use of net profit to calculate the AWW. Alternatively, Long contends that this Court should remand the case to the Commission for a hearing to determine a different computation method for AWW, \u201csuch as what figure [ ] Long would have to pay a general manager to do the work he did[.]\u201d</p>\n<p id=\"b295-5\">IWIF<footnotemark>10</footnotemark> responds that the Commission was correct in calculating Long\u2019s AWW by dividing the Employer\u2019s net profit\u2014 not gross receipts \u2014 by the number of weeks that Long had worked in the year that he was injured. IWIF contends that the Commission is permitted to deviate from the AWW calculation method set forth under the Act and in COMAR 14.09.03.06, and argues that the Commission was correct in deviating in this case because, as a sole proprietor, Long did not receive wages from the Employer. IWIF asserts that other jurisdictions have taken the position that the best method of calculating a sole proprietor\u2019s AWW is through using net profit or net taxable income.</p>\n<p id=\"b296-3\"><page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"264\">*264</page-number>IWIF maintains that an employer\u2019s gross receipts are not analogous to an employee\u2019s gross wages because gross receipts include business expenses and do not reflect the money that is actually available to the sole proprietor. According to IWIF, Long\u2019s 2011 federal individual tax return \u2014 specifically Schedule C and the Employer\u2019s net profit \u2014 provides the best evidence from which to calculate Long\u2019s AWW. IWIF contends that, unlike gross receipts, net profit represents the money that the sole proprietor earned and that is available to the sole proprietor after business expenses are taken into account. As to a relationship between the AWW and insurance premiums, IWIF contends that no Maryland court has held that insurance premiums dictate AWW and argues that using insurance premium estimates to calculate the AWW would be speculative. As a final matter, IWIF asserts that using the Employer\u2019s gross receipts to calculate Long\u2019s AWW would result in a \u201cwindfall benefit\u201d that is far beyond what Long actually earns.</p>\n<p id=\"b296-4\">Standard of Review</p>\n<p id=\"b296-5\">In <em>Hranicka v. Chesapeake Surgical, Ltd., </em>443 Md. 289, 297-98, 116 A.3d 507, 512 (2015), we set forth the applicable standard of review, stating:</p>\n<blockquote id=\"b296-6\">Generally, in an appeal from judicial review of an agency action, we review the agency\u2019s decision directly, not the decision of the circuit court or the Court of Special Appeals. We must respect the expertise of the agency and accord deference to its interpretation of a statute that it administers; however, we may always determine whether the administrative agency made an error of law. The Commission\u2019s decision \u201cis presumed to be prima facie correct[.]\u201d LE \u00a7 9 \u2014 745(b)(1). That presumption, however, does not extend to questions of law, which we review independently. We do, though, afford the Commission a degree of deference, as appropriate, in its formal interpretations of the Workers\u2019 Compensation Act.</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b296-7\">We have explained that an agency\u2019s interpretation of a regulation is a conclusion of law, and that a great deal of <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"265\">*265</page-number>deference is owed to an administrative agency\u2019s interpretation of its own regulation. Nevertheless, despite the deference, it is always within our prerogative to determine whether an agency\u2019s conclusions of law are correct. Accordingly, we determine whether the agency\u2019s conclusions are plainly erroneous or inconsistent with the regulation. When we construe an agency\u2019s rule or regulation, the principles governing our interpretation of a statute apply. Thus, we look to the regulation\u2019s plain language as the best evidence of its own meaning, and when the language is clear and unambiguous, our inquiry ordinarily ends there.</blockquote>\n<p id=\"b297-4\">(Some brackets, citations, and internal quotation marks omitted). Moreover, we have stated that, in cases involving the Act, \u201cwe also endeavor to interpret its provisions liberally, where possible, in order to effectuate the broad remedial purpose of the statutory scheme.\u201d <em>W.M. Schlosser Co. v. Uninsured Emp\u2019rs Fund, </em>414 Md. 195, 204, 994 A.2d 956, 961 (citation omitted).</p>\n<p id=\"b297-5\">As to the method for calculating a covered employee\u2019s AWW, we have stated that the issue essentially is a question of law. <em>See Gross v. Sessinghause &amp; Ostergaard, Inc., </em>331 Md. 37, 48, 626 A.2d 55, 61 (1993) (\u201cWhere the [AWW] issue in a workers\u2019 compensation case has not depended upon a resolution of disputed facts, but instead has concerned the method for determining the injured worker\u2019s [AWW], this Court has held that the question is one of law.\u201d (Citations, emphasis, footnote, and internal quotation marks omitted)).</p>\n<p id=\"b297-6\">Calculation of the AWW in Maryland</p>\n<p id=\"b297-7\">Under the Act, LE \u00a7 9-637(a), concerning payment of compensation, provides:</p>\n<blockquote id=\"b297-8\">(a) <em>Amount of payment. </em>\u2014 (1) Except as provided in paragraph (2) of this subsection, if a covered employee has a permanent total disability resulting from an accidental personal injury or an occupational disease, the employer or its insurer shall pay the covered employee compensation that equals two-thirds of the [AWW] of the covered employee, but may not:</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b298-3\"><page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"266\">*266</page-number>(i) exceed the State [AWW]; or</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b298-4\">(ii) be less than $25.</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b298-5\">(2) If the [AWW] of the covered employee is less than $25 at the time of the accidental personal injury or last injurious exposure to the hazards of the occupational disease, the employer or its insurer shall pay the covered employee weekly compensation that equals the [AWW] of the covered employee.</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b298-6\">(3) Payments under paragraph (1) or (2) of this subsection may not exceed a total of $45,000.[<footnotemark>11</footnotemark>]</blockquote>\n<p id=\"b298-7\">LE \u00a7 9-602(a), in turn, describes the general computation of a covered employee\u2019s AWW, providing:</p>\n<blockquote id=\"b298-8\">(1) Except as otherwise provided in this section, the [AWW] of a covered employee shall be computed by determining the average of the weekly wages of the covered employee:</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b298-9\">(i) when the covered employee is working full time; and</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b298-10\">(ii) at the time of:</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b298-11\">1. the accidental personal injury; or</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b298-12\">2. the last injurious exposure of the covered employee to the hazards of an occupational disease.</blockquote>\n<p id=\"b298-13\">(2) For purposes of a computation under paragraph (1) of this subsection, wages shall include:</p>\n<blockquote id=\"b298-14\">(i) tips; and</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b298-15\">(ii) the reasonable value of housing, lodging, meals, rent, and other similar advantages that the covered employee received from the employer.</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b298-16\">(3) If a covered employee establishes that, because of the age and experience of the covered employee at the time of the accidental personal injury or last injurious exposure to the hazards of the occupational disease, the wages of the covered employee could be expected to increase under normal circumstances, the expected increase may be taken <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"267\">*267</page-number>into account when computing the [AWW] of the covered employee under paragraph (1) of this subsection.</blockquote>\n<p id=\"b299-4\">Usually, a covered employee\u2019s AWW is calculated by adding gross wages that the employee earned in the fourteen weeks preceding the accidental personal injury and dividing the sum by fourteen. Indeed, COMAR 14.09.03.06<footnotemark>12</footnotemark> provides, in pertinent part:</p>\n<blockquote id=\"b299-5\">A. Preliminary Determination. For the purpose of making an initial award of compensation before a hearing in the matter, the Commission shall determine the claimant\u2019s [AWW] from gross wages, including overtime, reported by the claimant on the employee\u2019s claim form.</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b299-6\">B. Filing of Wage Statement. As soon as practicable, the employer/insurer shall file a wage statement containing the following information:</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b299-7\">(1) The average wage earned by the claimant during the 14 weeks before the accident, excluding the time between the end of the last pay period and the date of injury, provided that periods of involuntary layoff or involuntary authorized absences are not included in the 14 weeks;</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b299-8\">(2) Those weeks the claimant actually worked during the 14 weeks before the accident;</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b299-9\">(3) Vacation wages paid; and</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b299-10\">(4) Those items set forth in [LE] \u00a7 9-602(a)(2)[.]</blockquote>\n<p id=\"b299-11\">C. Determination at First Hearing.</p>\n<blockquote id=\"b299-12\">(1) Calculation of the [AWW] shall be adjudicated and determined at the first hearing before the Commission.</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b299-13\">(2) All parties shall be prepared to produce evidence from which the Commission can determine an accurate [AWW] at the first hearing.</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b299-14\">(3) If the Commission determines that an inaccurate [AWW] resulted in the overpayment or underpayment of benefits, the Commission may order:</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b300-3\"><page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"268\">*268</page-number>(a) A credit against future permanent disability benefits;</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b300-4\">(b) The payment of additional compensation; or</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b300-5\">(c) Any other relief the Commission determines is appropriate under the circumstances.</blockquote>\n<p id=\"b300-6\">This Court has held, however, that, under certain circumstances, the Commission has discretion to use a period that is longer or shorter than the period that COMAR 14.09.03.06 sets forth to determine the AWW. For example, in <em>Gross, </em>331 Md. at 39, 626 A.2d at 56, this Court considered the time period that the Commission could use in determining a covered employee\u2019s AWW. At issue in that case was COMAR 14.09.03.06\u2019s predecessor, COMAR 14.09.01.05, which provided that, \u201cunless otherwise ordered after the hearing, compensation payments shall be based on: [ ] the [AWW] earned by the employee during the 13 weeks before the accident[.]\u201d <em>Gross, </em>331 Md. at 40, 626 A.2d at 57. In considering whether the Commission could depart from the thirteen-week period after a hearing, we noted that, \u201cprior to the promulgation of a regulation specifying a time period for calculating a[n] injured worker\u2019s [AWW], the Commission was free to choose an appropriate period on a case-by-case basis.\u201d <em>Id. </em>at 50, 626 A.2d at 62. Indeed, several of this Court\u2019s cases \u201crecognized that an injured worker\u2019s [AWW] can be based on a one[-]year period.\u201d <em>Id. </em>at 50, 626 A.2d at 62 (citations omitted). Ultimately, we held that the Commission could depart from the time period set forth in COMAR, explaining:</p>\n<blockquote id=\"b300-7\">[COMAR 14.09.01.05] appears to be designed to address the vast majority of cases in which there is no hearing. In such cases, it provides a definite rule in lieu of a case-by-case basis. The regulation also supplies a standard in those cases in which there is a hearing but where no question arises concerning the appropriate time period or where the Commission decides that it should not depart from the thirteen-week rule. Nevertheless, contrary to the view of the courts below, in a case where there is a hearing, the regulation does not purport to restrict the Commission in <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"269\">*269</page-number>any manner from utilizing a different time period if the Commission deems it appropriate to do so.</blockquote>\n<p id=\"b301-4\">Gross, 331 Md. at 50, 626 A.2d at 62 (footnote omitted).</p>\n<p id=\"b301-5\">Thus, generally speaking, a covered employee\u2019s AWW is calculated based on LE \u00a7 9-602(a) and COMAR 14.09.03.06. And, once the AWW is calculated, LE \u00a7 9-637(a)(l) instructs the employer or the insurer to \u201cpay the covered employee compensation that equals two-thirds of the [AWW] of the covered employee[.]\u201d For the ordinary employee, the operation of these provisions poses no issue. A sole proprietor, however, is self-employed and not an \u201cemployee\u201d in the traditional sense. Indeed, pursuant to LE \u00a7 9-227(a), \u201ca sole proprietor is not a covered employee\u201d unless he or she makes an election in accordance with LE \u00a7 9-227(b) and submits written notice of that election to the Commission and the insurer in accordance with LE \u00a7 9-227(c).<footnotemark>13</footnotemark> And, as the Supreme Court of Arizona has recognized:</p>\n<blockquote id=\"b301-6\">In reality, sole proprietors are not employees and do not earn wages. A sole proprietor can never be an employee of the business he or she creates because a sole proprietor and the business are one legal entity. A person cannot be one\u2019s own employee. Nor does a sole proprietor receive a \u201cwage\u201d from the business for his or her services. Thus, using employee language in a nonemployee setting creates definitional problems.</blockquote>\n<p id=\"b301-7\"><em>Mail Boxes v. Indus. Comm\u2019n of Ariz., </em>181 Ariz. 119, 888 P.2d 777, 779 (1995).</p>\n<p id=\"b301-8\">Significantly, in Maryland, the Act does not address how to calculate the AWW of a sole proprietor who has elected to be a \u201ccovered employee.\u201d And neither this Court nor the Court of Special Appeals (until this case) has addressed the matter. Thus, we examine relevant case law from Maryland and other <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"270\">*270</page-number>jurisdictions to determine the best calculation method for determining a sole proprietor\u2019s AWW.</p>\n<p id=\"b302-4\">Relevant Maryland Case Law</p>\n<p id=\"b302-5\">This Court has commented on the correlation between the basis of workers\u2019 compensation insurance premiums and actual wages that are paid to the employee. In <em>Picanardi v. Emerson Hotel Co., </em>135 Md. 92, 93-96, 108 A. 483, 483-84 (1919), this Court held that an employee\u2019s AWW did not include the monetary value for the employee\u2019s board where the monetary value of the employee\u2019s board had not been established at the time that the employee was hired, and this Court held that the AWW could not be calculated on a basis that was broader than that for calculating insurance premiums. The employee worked as a baker for the Emerson Hotel Company, and injured his hand during the course of his employment. <em>See id. </em>at 92, 108 A. at 483. The employee was paid $50 per month and board, but there was no agreement between the employee and the Emerson Hotel Company at the time that he was hired as to the monetary value of the board. <em>See id. </em>at 92-93, 108 A. at 483. After the injury, the employee applied for workers\u2019 compensation, and the Commission ordered compensation that was based on the employee\u2019s monthly wages. <em>See id. </em>at 93, 108 A. at 483. The employee appealed, contending that he should have been permitted to prove the monetary value of the board and to have that included as part of his AWW. <em>See id. </em>at 93, 108 A. at 483.</p>\n<p id=\"b302-6\">This Court considered whether the employee was entitled under the Act \u201cto have the money value of board included as part of his weekly wages in computing the amount of compensation to which he may be entitled, where the money value of the board had not been fixed between his employer and himself at the time of the hiring[.]\u201d <em>Id. </em>at 93-94, 108 A. at 483-84. We answered that question in the negative, and observed that, because the monetary value of the board was not fixed when the employment started, the value of the board would not have been used in determining what the Emerson Hotel Company paid in workers\u2019 compensation insurance pre<page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"271\">*271</page-number>miums. <em>See id. </em>at 94-95, 108 A. at 484. Specifically, at the time, the Act provided that the State Accident Fund and private insurers needed to base insurance premiums on the employers\u2019 \u201cpayrolls.\u201d <em>Id. </em>at 94, 108 A. at 484. \u201cPayroll,\u201d however, was synonymous with \u201cwages,\u201d and \u201cwages\u201d meant \u201cmoney or other things which ha[d] been given a fixed money value at the outset[.]\u201d <em>Id. </em>at 95, 108 A. at 484. Indeed, we stated: \u201cThe State Accident Fund is created by premiums equal to fixed percentages of the money paid under employers\u2019 pay[ Jrolls. Provision is made for the facilitation of calculation on the basis on these payrolls.\u201d <em>Id. </em>at 94, 108 A. at 484 (citations omitted).</p>\n<p id=\"b303-4\">Because insurers could not have charged premiums for board where the monetary value of the board was not fixed at the time of hiring and was not part of the payroll, this Court concluded that the compensation to the employee could not have been based on an AWW that included the value of board, explaining: \u201cIt is clear [that] the [General Assembly] did not intend, as to insurance in the State Accident Fund, that board was to be included as wages, unless its money value was fixed by the parties at the time of the hiring.\u201d <em>Id. </em>at 96, 108 A. at 484. Furthermore, we concluded that \u201cit would be unreasonable to hold that it was intended that the premiums and rates of insurance from which the fund to pay losses were derived were to be calculated on a narrower basis than that adopted for the allowance of compensation.\u201d <em>Id. </em>at 96, 108 A. at 484.</p>\n<p id=\"b303-5\">In <em>Stevenson v. Hill, </em>171 Md. 572, 575, 189 A. 910, 912 (1937), this Court held that a part-time employee\u2019s AWW was to be calculated based on the average of the amount that the employee might have earned working all the time that the coal mines in the region generally were operated over a period immediately preceding the injury. The employee was a coal inspector who sustained an injury while at work that caused his death. <em>See id. </em>at 573, 189 A. at 911. Because of the Great Depression, the mine at which the employee had been employed was not operational year-round, and the employee had not been employed full-time. <em>See id. </em>at 574, 189 A. at 911. At the time, the Act provided that compensation was to be based <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"272\">*272</page-number>on the employee\u2019s AWW that was \u201cearned by an employee when working on full time.\u201d <em>Id. </em>at 573, 189 A. at 911. The Commission ordered compensation based on the employee\u2019s AWW, which it calculated based on the wages that the employee earned during the six months preceding his death. <em>See id. </em>at 573, 189 A. at 911. The employee\u2019s widow applied to reopen the case, and the Commission adjusted the employee\u2019s AWW based on the wages that the employee earned in the year preceding his death; the adjustment of the AWW, however, did not increase the compensation to be paid. <em>See id. </em>at 573, 189 A. at 911. The employee\u2019s widow appealed, contending that the employee\u2019s AWW should be based on what he \u201cwould have [] earned if the mines had been working to capacity, or to the limit of daily and weekly working time in the region, eight hours a day for six days a week[.]\u201d <em>Id. </em>at 575, 189 A. at 912.</p>\n<p id=\"b304-4\">This Court rejected the employee\u2019s widow\u2019s calculation method for the AWW, and held that, in accordance with prior case law, the AWW was \u201cto be determined by an average of the amount the employee might have earned working all the time the mines in the region generally were employed over a period immediately preceding the injury[.]\u201d <em>Id. </em>at 575, 189 A. at 912. Relying in part on <em>Picanardi, </em>this Court explained:</p>\n<blockquote id=\"ASF\">The [workers\u2019 compensation] system has as its foundation a correspondence between compensation to be paid and the amounts paid the active workmen according to the pay rolls. The actual earnings are to furnish the basis of calculating the fund to cover the compensation, which is built up by insurance with an insurance carrier, the State Accident Fund, or by self-insurance. The premiums paid or set aside to constitute the fund are thus ascertained. The actual earnings are taken as determining the risk in loss of earnings or capacity. This correspondence would have to be disregarded to accept the present claimant\u2019s contention. The insurance premiums and the fund built up for compensation would lose their relation to the compensation to be paid. Employers distributing work on the share-the-work plan would multiply the responsibility for compensation <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"273\">*273</page-number>without any increase in work done. Part-time work for the benefit of employees during a time of depression could be provided only under a like disproportionate burden of compensation. Conceivably work[ers who are] injured might be entitled to receive much more by reason of their injuries than they could possibly earn at work.</blockquote>\n<p id=\"b305-4\"><em>Id. </em>at 576-77, 189 A. at 912-13 (citations omitted).</p>\n<p id=\"b305-5\">In <em>Crowner v. Balt. United Butchers Ass\u2019n, </em>226 Md. 606, 607-08, 612-13, 175 A.2d 7, 7-8, 10 (1961), this Court held that the AWW of an employee, who was injured while working at a once-a-month weekend job, was to be calculated based only on the wages that the employee earned at the once-a-month weekend job, and not based on those wages plus the employee\u2019s regular full-time wages. The employee worked full-time for Armour and Company (\u201cArmour\u201d), earning $90.80 weekly; the employee also worked one Saturday per month for Baltimore United Butchers Association (\u201cBaltimore United\u201d), earning $15 for each Saturday that he worked. <em>See id. </em>at 607-08, 175 A.2d at 7-8. The employee was injured while working for Baltimore United. <em>See id. </em>at 608, 175 A.2d at 8. The employee submitted a workers\u2019 compensation claim, and the Commission awarded him compensation based on an AWW of $3.46, which was the AWW of the Baltimore United job only. See <em>id. </em>at 608, 175 A.2d at 8. The employee contended that his AWW should have taken into account his earnings from both Armour and Baltimore United. <em>See id. </em>at 608, 175 A.2d at 8.</p>\n<p id=\"b305-6\">This Court affirmed the Commission\u2019s decision that the employee\u2019s AWW should have been calculated based on what he earned from Baltimore United only, explaining:</p>\n<blockquote id=\"b305-7\">In the instant case the [employee] entered into a contract of hire with the employer, the terms of which were specific as to all factors. The employer insured the [employee]\u2019s employment in accordance with the provisions of the [Workers\u2019] Compensation law. By reason of the contract of hire the employer incurred certain obligations under the Compensation law. To impose other additional obligations on the employer and insurer, both of whom were, at the time of <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"274\">*274</page-number>the accident, complying fully with all of their obligations under both the statutes and.their contracts, would be unfair and, by judicial construction, extend the coverage of the compensation law into an area which would lead to disruption and confusion. If the law should be broadened to include the [employeej\u2019s claim it should be modified by the [General Assembly], and not by our decision in this case.</blockquote>\n<p id=\"ACn\"><em>Id. </em>at 612-13, 175 A.2d at 10.</p>\n<p id=\"b306-4\">More recently, in <em>Uninsured Emp\u2019rs Fund v. Pennel, </em>133 Md.App. 279, 285-86, 754 A.2d 1120, 1123 (2000), the Court of Special Appeals held that breakfasts that an employer prepared for a farm worker constituted \u201cpayroll\u201d under the Act such that the farm worker was a covered employee. In its analysis, the Court looked to LE \u00a7 9-602(a) and how a covered employee\u2019s AWW is calculated, and pointed out that, in <em>Crowner </em>and <em>Picanardi, </em>this Court had \u201crecognized the nexus between the terms \u2018payroll\u2019 and \u2018[AWW]\u2019 as they are used in the Act.\u201d <em>Pennel, </em>133 Md.App. at 293-94, 754 A.2d at 1127-28. The Court explained that the employer made breakfast for the farm worker six days per week for twelve years, and that the meals constituted compensation to the farm worker for his labor and thus should have been included in the computation of his wages. <em>See id. </em>at 295, 754 A.2d at 1128. And, the Court stated that, \u201c[g]iven the relationship between the terms \u2018wages\u2019 and \u2018payroll,\u2019 [the Court] further conclude[d] that the meals were part of the payroll in th[e] case.\u201d <em>Id. </em>at 295, 754 A.2d at 1128.</p>\n<p id=\"b306-5\">The Court then addressed our holding in <em>Picanardi, </em>135 Md. at 96, 108 A. at 484 \u2014 that \u201c[i]t is clear the [General Assembly] did not intend, as to insurance in the State Accident Fund, that board was to be included as wages unless its money value was fixed by the parties at the time of the hearing\u201d \u2014 and noted that \u201cnothing in the record suggested] that the monetary value of the meals was fixed by the parties when [the farm worker] was hired.\u201d <em>Pennel, </em>133 Md.App. at 295, 754 A.2d at 1128-29. Nonetheless, the Court held that, because of amendments to the Act as well as subsequent case law, \u201cfixing the value of meals at the time of hiring is no <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"275\">*275</page-number>longer a prerequisite to recovering the reasonable value of meals under the circumstances presented in this case.\u201d <em>Id. </em>at 295, 754 A.2d at 1129. Indeed, the Court noted that at the time that <em>Picanardi </em>was decided, the Act provided that payroll included, among other things, \u201cwages ... whether payable in money, board or otherwise[, pjrovided the money value of board and similar advantages shall have been fixed by parties at the time of hiring.\u201d <em>Pennel, </em>133 Md.App. at 295-96, 754 A.2d at 1129 (quoting <em>Picanardi, </em>135 Md. at 95-96, 108 A. at 484). However, the Court explained that, after <em>Picanardi, </em>the Act was amended to no longer make \u201creference to any requirement that the value of board (meals) and similar advantages be fixed at the time of hiring\u201d and recent case law held that \u201csuch details may be unnecessary, as the value of meals, rent, lodging and similar advantages, consideration of which is necessary in the computation of wages under the Act, are easily converted into monetary figures with a present cash value.\u201d <em>Pennel, </em>133 Md.App. at 296, 754 A.2d at 1129. In other words, in <em>Pennel, </em>the Court implicitly recognized that the reasoning that underlay this Court\u2019s decision in <em>Picanardi </em>has been superseded by both statute and case law; <em>i.e., </em>our reasoning in <em>Picanardi </em>is based on statutory language that no longer exists.</p>\n<p id=\"b307-4\">In any event, significantly, none of these <em>cases </em>\u2014 Picanardi, <em>Stevenson, Crowner, </em>or <em>Pennel </em>\u2014 involved a self-employed sole proprietor\u2019s AWW, and the method by which a sole proprietor\u2019s AWW should be calculated. Thus, we look to other jurisdictions that have considered calculation of a self-employed individual\u2019s AWW for guidance.</p>\n<p id=\"b307-5\">Case Law from Other Jurisdictions</p>\n<p id=\"b307-6\">Courts in other jurisdictions are split regarding whether gross receipts, net profit, or some other figure is the best method by which to calculate a sole proprietor\u2019s AWW. In <em>Little Suwannee Lumber Co. v. Fitzgerald, </em>172 Ga.App. 144, 322 S.E.2d 347, 348-49 (1984), the Court of Appeals of Georgia held that an independent contractor\u2019s AWW was properly calculated based on the independent contractor\u2019s gross re<page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"276\">*276</page-number>ceipts, without deducting his \u201cproduction costs.\u201d In that case, the independent contractor was injured while attempting to fell a tree. <em>See id. </em>at 348. The independent contractor, who was entitled to workers\u2019 compensation coverage, filed a claim for benefits. <em>See id. </em>The State Board of Workers\u2019 Compensation determined that the independent contractor\u2019s AWW could not be \u201creasonably and fairly determined\u201d based on the statutory method, and instead used the independent contractor\u2019s \u201cfull-time wage[,]\u201d awarding compensation based on the independent contractor\u2019s gross receipts without deducting production costs. <em>Id. </em>On appeal, the employer contended that the independent contractor\u2019s production costs should have been deducted when calculating his AWW because the independent contractor was not an \u201cemployee.\u201d <em>Id. </em>The Court disagreed and upheld the Board\u2019s calculation, explaining:</p>\n<blockquote id=\"b308-4\">The Georgia Workers\u2019 Compensation Act is a humanitarian measure meant to provide relief to the injured employee, and the Act should be liberally interpreted by the courts to carry out that purpose. In light of that purpose and given the circumstances of the instant case, we cannot countenance an interpretation of the Act which will result in a reduction of benefits to recipients.</blockquote>\n<p id=\"b308-5\"><em>Id. </em>at 348-49 (citation omitted).</p>\n<p id=\"b308-6\">The Court also addressed the employer\u2019s argument that, as used in the Georgia Workers\u2019 Compensation Act, the terms \u201cfees\u201d and \u201cwages\u201d were distinct, with \u201cfees being the gross amounts [the employer] paid [the independent contractor], and wages being the net amounts [the independent contractor] retained for himself after expenses.\u201d <em>Id. </em>at 349. As to that point, the Court explained:</p>\n<blockquote id=\"b308-7\">The Act does not specifically define either term, leaving us to apply ordinary meanings in everyday usage. Webster\u2019s 7th New Collegiate Dictionary defines \u201cwage\u201d as \u201ca payment, usually of money for labor or services usually according to contract and on an hourly, daily, or piecework basis ... especially for physical labor.\u201d \u201cFee\u201d is offered as a synonym; it \u201capplies to the price asked or paid for services of a physician, lawyer, artist or other professional.\u201d Clear<page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"277\">*277</page-number>ly, it is not mandated by definition or otherwise that one make any deductions before calculating the [independent contractor]\u2019s wages, particularly in view of the fact that [the employer] deducted the workers\u2019 compensation premiums from his gross, rather than net, receipts. It appearing that [the employer] made an election, this court will not rescue it from its decision.</blockquote>\n<p id=\"b309-4\"><em>Id. </em>(ellipsis in original).</p>\n<p id=\"b309-5\">By contrast, other jurisdictions have held that net profit is the best figure to use for calculating a self-employed individual\u2019s AWW. In <em>Stephen v. Avins Constr. Co., </em>324 S.C. 334, 478 S.E.2d 74, 75 (Ct.App.1996), the Court of Appeals of South Carolina held that the South Carolina Workers\u2019 Compensation Commission was correct in computing a subcontractor\u2019s AWW based on net, as opposed to gross, earnings. In that case, the subcontractor sustained an injury during the course of his employment as a subcontractor for a construction company. <em>See id. </em>The subcontractor received compensation, and sometime afterward, the construction company sought permission to discontinue compensation payments on the ground that the subcontractor had reached maximum medical improvement. <em>See id. </em>At a hearing, the subcontractor testified that he employed as many as four people, and the construction company paid the subcontractor per job and deducted workers\u2019 compensation premiums before paying the subcontractor for his labor. <em>See id. </em>The subcontractor admitted that the money that was paid to him reflected all the money paid to his business, including what he paid other employees. <em>See id. </em>As the workers\u2019 compensation commissioner found, the money that was paid to the subcontractor was for an entire job, and did not solely reflect the subcontractor\u2019s earnings, and, the money that was paid to the subcontractor included the costs of materials, wages that were paid to other employees, and other expenses. <em>See id. </em>Accordingly, the commissioner granted the construction company\u2019s motion to discontinue payment of compensation, and held that the subcontractor\u2019s AWW \u201cshould be based upon his tax returns as a self-employed subcontractor.]\u201d <em>Id. </em>The subcontractor appealed, contending that his <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"278\">*278</page-number>AWW should have been based on his gross income, not his net profit, and arguing that the construction company had paid insurance premiums that were based on the subcontractor\u2019s gross income. <em>See id. </em>at 75, 76.</p>\n<p id=\"b310-4\">The Court affirmed the commissioner\u2019s calculation of the subcontractor\u2019s AWW, holding that there was \u201csubstantial evidence in the record to support a finding that [the subcontractor]^ [AWW] and compensation rate should be based upon his net earnings, [the subcontractor]^ gross earnings having included wages paid to other employees and various business deductions.\u201d <em>Id. </em>at 81. The Court began its analysis by looking to the South Carolina Workers\u2019 Compensation Act, which defined AWW as \u201cthe earnings of the injured employee in the employment in which he was working at the time of the injury during the period of fifty-two weeks immediately preceding the date of the injury[,]\u201d and did not \u201cspecify whether \u2018wages\u2019 refers to net or gross earnings of a business owner operating as a subcontractor.\u201d <em>Id. </em>at 76. Because the Supreme Court of South Carolina had not addressed the calculation of a subcontractor\u2019s AWW, and because the statute did not address the matter, the Court looked to other jurisdictions for guidance, including <em>Fitzgerald, </em>322 S.E.2d 347. <em>See Stephen, </em>478 S.E.2d at 78-80. The Court explained that there are \u201c[djifficulties [] inherent in using gross pay for the purpose of determining the \u2018earnings of the injured employee^]\u2019 \u201d stating:</p>\n<blockquote id=\"b310-5\">A plethora of business expenses may be encapsulated within the gross pay received. Examples of expenses not included in computing the earnings of a covered person are automobile allowances; mileage expenses; equipment rentals; labor, fuel, repair bills, and insurance; and depreciation of business equipment, interest on business debts, and the purchase price of a saw[.]</blockquote>\n<p id=\"b310-6\"><em>Id. </em>at 80 (citations omitted). The Court then noted that the subcontractor had deducted numerous business expenses on his income tax form, including car and truck expenses, travel, meals and entertainment, and wages. <em>See id.</em></p>\n<p id=\"b311-3\"><page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"279\">*279</page-number>The Court rejected the subcontractor\u2019s contention that his AWW had to be based on gross pay because that figure was the basis of the insurance premiums, reasoning:</p>\n<blockquote id=\"b311-4\">The quiddity of [the subcontractor's contention to support a calculation based on gross pay is the deduction of Workers\u2019 Compensation premiums from his gross pay by [the construction company]. Facially, this would seem to justify the use of gross pay rather than net pay. However, we reject this argument and hold that reimbursements received by [the subcontractor] cannot be the basis for a computation of his \u201cearnings.\u201d The [c]ommission[er] was correct in calculating the \u201cearnings\u201d of [the subcontractor] by using [the subcontractor]^ [AWW] of $272.09, based upon his tax returns as a self-employed contractor, resulting in a compensation rate of $181.39. [The subcontractor]^ gross receipts totaled $37,070.00. His net profits totaled $14,150.00. [The subcontractor]^ net profit, $14,150.00, divided by 52 (number of weeks in a year) totals $272.09. Two-thirds of $272.09 equals $181.39.</blockquote>\n<p id=\"b311-5\"><em>Id. </em>at 81 (brackets, ellipsis, and some internal quotation marks omitted). The Court ultimately concluded:</p>\n<blockquote id=\"b311-6\">We hold that a subcontractor\u2019s compensation rate should be determined based on his net taxable income even though the subcontractor was charged Workers\u2019 Compensation premiums based on his gross earnings. In our view, the statutory language, \u201cearnings of the injured employee,\u201d means the actual sum paid to the employee as his wages, not the totality of the payments including reimbursements. Reimbursements do not equate with the statutory language of \u201cearnings.\u201d Accordingly, we affirm the ruling of the Workers\u2019 Compensation Commission that [the subcontractor]^ [AWW] should be computed based on his net, as opposed to his gross, earnings.</blockquote>\n<p id=\"b311-7\">\n<em>Id.</em>\n</p>\n<p id=\"b311-8\">Similarly, in <em>In re Carnahan, </em>149 N.H. 433, 821 A.2d 1122, 1123-24 (2003), the Supreme Court of New Hampshire affirmed a compensation award in which a self-employed cross-<page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"280\">*280</page-number>country truck driver\u2019s AWW was based on net profit, not gross income. In that case, the driver worked as an independent contractor, was injured, and began receiving benefits. <em>See id. </em>at 1123. The driver requested a hearing, contesting the insurer\u2019s calculation of his disability benefits. <em>See id. </em>At the hearing, the driver produced tax returns showing gross receipts that totaled $129,729 and business deductions that totaled $102,184 in expenses for motels, uniforms, laundry service, meals and entertainment, and depreciation of his truck. <em>See id. </em>at 1123-24. Based on the tax return, the hearing officer calculated the driver\u2019s AWW by dividing his net profit of $27,545 by the thirty-eight weeks that he had worked that year. <em>See id. </em>at 1124. The driver appealed, contending, in pertinent part, that his AWW should have been calculated based on his gross income and not his net profit. <em>See id.</em></p>\n<p id=\"b312-4\">As to that argument, the Court observed that the workers\u2019 compensation act provided that AWW was to be computed \u201cby dividing \u2018gross earnings\u2019 over a period of 26 to 52 weeks (in order to yield a result most favorable to the employee) by that number of weeks.\u201d <em>Id. </em>The statute, however, did not define \u201cgross earnings,\u201d and the driver contended that \u201cgross earnings\u201d was synonymous with \u201cgross income.\u201d <em>Id. </em>The Court rejected that argument, explaining:</p>\n<blockquote id=\"b312-5\">This construction, however, produces an absurd result. An independent contractor with a gross income of $200,000 who incurs $150,000 in business expenses would have \u201cgross earnings\u201d of $200,000. At the same time, an employee who does the same work, receiving a salary of $50,000, while his employer covers business expenses of $150,000, would have only $50,000 in \u201cgross earnings.\u201d Nothing in the statute suggests that self-employed contractors should be entitled to such a windfall.</blockquote>\n<p id=\"b312-6\"><em>Id. </em>Instead, the Court stated that, because the driver had \u201cproduced no evidence, other than his tax returns, that would suggest an alternate method of calculating his income, [the Court] agree[d] that the board was correct to use his net profit of approximately $27,545 as his \u2018gross earnings.\u2019 \u201d <em>Id. </em><page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"281\">*281</page-number>The Court also disagreed that the statutory definition of wages required that certain expenses be included in the calculation of the driver\u2019s AWW. <em>See id. </em>at 1125. The Court stated: \u201c[A]llowing a self-employed contractor to include his business expenditures as \u201cwages\u2019 would lead to the same absurd windfall inherent in [the driver\u2019s suggested definition of \u2018gross earnings,\u2019 as a salaried employee cannot include employer-reimbursed business expenses as \u201cwages.\u2019 \u201d <em>Id. </em>(citation omitted).</p>\n<p id=\"b313-4\">Likewise, in <em>Vite v. Vite, </em>2010 Ark. App. 565, 377 S.W.3d 453, 455, 459 (Ark.Ct.App.2010), the Court of Appeals of Arkansas held that the workers\u2019 compensation commission was correct in calculating a self-employed sole proprietor\u2019s AWW based on his net profit (taking into account deductions for business expenses) instead of his gross receipts. In that case, the sole proprietor was a carpet layer who injured his back during the course of his employment. <em>See id. </em>at 455. At a hearing, the sole proprietor argued that his AWW \u201cshould be calculated upon gross earnings without consideration of business deductions[.]\u201d <em>See id. </em>The Commission rejected that approach and instead relied on Schedule C in the sole proprietor\u2019s income tax returns, in which the gross receipts totaled $292,734, the expenses and depreciation totaled $265,695, and the net profit was $27,039. <em>See id. </em>at 457-58. Using those figures, the Commission determined that the sole proprietor\u2019s AWW was $587.30 by dividing the net profit of $27,039 by forty-six, the number of weeks that the sole proprietor had worked the year prior to his injury. <em>See id. </em>at 458.</p>\n<p id=\"b313-5\">On appeal, the sole proprietor contended \u201cthat the Commission erred in deducting from his gross wages three business expenses: $16,560 for car and truck expenses, $8,202 for insurance, and $1,270 for legal and professional services.\u201d <em>Id. </em>The sole proprietor also argued that, after deducting for contract labor, he earned over $93,000. <em>See id. </em>The sole proprietorship and the insurers responded that using net profit rather than gross earnings to calculate the sole proprietor\u2019s AWW was \u201c[e]minently reasonable for ascertaining a <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"282\">*282</page-number>self-employed claimant\u2019s weekly wage because it provides a close estimate of average wage or take-home pay.\u201d <em>Id. </em>In addressing the issue, the Court first looked to a prior case in which the commission addressed \u201cwhat portion of business expenses, if any, should be deducted from a sole proprietorship\u2019s gross income in calculating\u201d AWW. <em>Id. </em>at 457. The Commission concluded:</p>\n<blockquote id=\"b314-4\">Although the claimant insists that no expenses should be deducted, other states have held that a sole proprietorship\u2019s net earnings should be used as the basis for determining a claimant\u2019s wages because inclusion of unreimbursed business expenses does not accurately reflect a claimant\u2019s actual earnings during the period. Net earnings represent the difference between gross income and necessary business operating expenses.</blockquote>\n<p id=\"b314-5\"><em>Id. </em>(citations omitted). The Court also set forth the relevant provisions of the Arkansas Workers\u2019 Compensation Act, which provided that \u201c[c]ompensation shall be computed on the [AWW] earned by the employee under the contract of hire in force at the time of the accident and in no case shall be computed on less than a full-time workweek in the employment.\u201d <em>Id. </em>at 458 (citation omitted). The act provided that \u201c[i]f, because of exceptional circumstances, the [AWW] cannot be fairly and justly determined by the above formulas, the commission may determine the [AWW] by a method that is just and fair to all parties concerned.\u201d <em>Id. </em>(citation and emphasis omitted). Moreover, the Arkansas Workers\u2019 Compensation Act provided that \u201cworkers\u2019 compensation statutes [ ] must be strictly construed, allowing nothing to be taken as intended unless clearly expressed.\u201d <em>Id. </em>at 459 (citations omitted).</p>\n<p id=\"b314-6\">In accordance with the statutes and case law, the Court concluded:</p>\n<blockquote id=\"b314-7\">[T]he Commission\u2019s decision to deduct the business expenses [the sole proprietor] claimed from his gross receipts, as set forth in his 2007 federal tax return, constituted a determination of [AWW] that was \u2018just and fair to all parties,\u2019 as allowed by [statute]. The Commission\u2019s inter<page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"283\">*283</page-number>pretation of the statute was correct, and we affirm its decision to deduct all claimed business expenses from gross earnings in the present case.</blockquote>\n<p id=\"b315-4\">\n<em>Id.</em>\n</p>\n<p id=\"b315-5\">Similarly, in <em>Meredith Constr. Co. v. Holcombe, </em>21 Va.App. 537, 466 S.E.2d 108, 109-10 (1996), the Court of Appeals of Virginia affirmed the workers\u2019 compensation commission\u2019s award, in which the commission calculated a self-employed sole proprietor\u2019s AWW \u201cbased upon the net taxable income, including depreciation, reported [by the sole proprietor]^ business^]\u201d and stated that, \u201c[w]hen the earnings of an injured employee are not amenable to the primary calculation specified in [the statute], the commission properly resorts to such other method of computing [AWW] most nearly approximating the amount which the injured employee earns.\u201d (Citations, brackets, ellipses, and internal quotation marks omitted).</p>\n<p id=\"b315-6\">Still other jurisdictions have held that, under circumstances in which net profit is not an appropriate measure of an individual\u2019s earnings, a different method of calculating AWW is proper. For example, in <em>Mail Boxes, </em>888 P.2d at 778, the Supreme Court of Arizona was \u201casked to define the term \u2018actual average monthly wage\u2019 as it appears in [the workers\u2019 compensation act] for purposes of calculating a sole proprietor\u2019s permanent disability benefits[,]\u201d and held \u201cthat a sole proprietor\u2019s \u2018wage\u2019 is measured by the market value of his or her services to the business[.]\u201d In that case, the sole proprietor had workers\u2019 compensation coverage and was assessed an insurance premium on an estimated average monthly wage of $1,650. <em>See id. </em>During the course of his employment, the sole proprietor was injured and filed a workers\u2019 compensation claim. <em>See id. </em>The sole proprietor\u2019s average monthly wage was set at $1,650 for purposes of temporary benefits, but the State Compensation Fund subsequently determined that the sole proprietor had earned no wages in the year that he was injured, recalculated the average monthly wage as $0, and denied all permanent disability benefits. <em>See id. </em>The sole proprietor requested a hearing, and an administrative law <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"284\">*284</page-number>judge reinstated the previous award based on an average monthly wage of $1,650, finding</p>\n<blockquote id=\"ADi\">that even though the business did not show a profit in 1989, losses would have increased by approximately $1,733.32 per month if [the sole proprietor] had operated only as an owner or investor in the business. Because $1,733.32 was greater than the assumed average monthly wage of $1,650, he chose the lesser of the two figures, as required by [statute.]</blockquote>\n<p id=\"A2y\"><em>Id. </em>at 778-79 (footnote omitted).</p>\n<p id=\"b316-4\">The Arizona Workers\u2019 Compensation Act provided that \u201ccompensation for a sole proprietor\u2019s permanent disability is the lesser of the \u2018actual average monthly wage\u2019 or the agreed upon \u2018assumed monthly wage.\u2019 \u201d <em>Id. </em>at 779 (citation and footnote omitted). The Court examined the term \u201cactual average monthly wage,\u201d and explained:</p>\n<blockquote id=\"b316-5\">Wages and earned income are different accounting terms. The underlying purpose of the Workers\u2019 Compensation Act ... is to compensate an employee for lost earning capacity and to prevent the injured employee and dependents from becoming public charges during the period of disability. With that purpose in mind, a sole proprietor\u2019s \u201cwage\u201d cannot mean the business\u2019s \u201cearned income.\u201d Applying the \u201cearned income\u201d definition in this case would mean the employee paid his premiums for no coverage \u2014 a result contrary to the intent of the Act, which is to provide coverage to premium-paying sole proprietors.</blockquote>\n<p id=\"b316-6\"><em>Id. </em>at 779-80 (citation omitted). The Court then noted the important public policy considerations that dictated its holding, reasoning:</p>\n<blockquote id=\"b316-7\">We do not believe that the legislature intended to condition a sole proprietor\u2019s compensation on the success of the business. It is common knowledge, and even the Fund\u2019s accountant agreed, that often a business will not show a profit during the first year or few years of operation. It would be a great windfall to the carrier to be allowed to collect premiums during these years but deny benefits. Applying the \u201cearned income\u201d definition also leads to unto<page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"285\">*285</page-number>ward results. For example, if both a sole proprietor and his employee are injured on the first day of business, the employee could receive permanent disability benefits but the sole proprietor could not. And what of the sole proprietor who earns a profit one year and not the next? Whether benefits are paid would depend on whether the insured is fortuitous enough to be injured during a profitable year. But the value of his services to the business do not change. The labor performed is the same, whether it results in profit or reduced losses.</blockquote>\n<p id=\"b317-4\"><em>Id. </em>at 780. Accordingly, the Court held that \u201c[t]he best way to measure the lost earning capacity of a sole proprietor is by the market value of the services performed.\u201d <em>Id. </em>at 780-81.</p>\n<p id=\"b317-5\">In <em>McAnelly v. Wilson Pallet and Crate Co., </em>120 N.C.App. 127, 460 S.E.2d 894, 899 (1995), the Court of Appeals of North Carolina held that the workers\u2019 compensation commission erred in determining a sole proprietor\u2019s AWW based on net profit instead of the sole proprietor\u2019s earnings. After the sole proprietor was injured during the course of his employment, a deputy commissioner determined that the sole proprietor\u2019s AWW was $573.07, with compensation at a rate of $376 per week. <em>See id. </em>at 895. Subsequently, because the sole proprietorship did not have any net profit the year preceding the sole proprietor\u2019s injury, the full commission adjusted the award from compensation of $376 per week to the minimum rate of $30 per week. <em>See id. </em>Upon review, the Court reversed the full commission\u2019s decision and reinstated the deputy commissioner\u2019s award, explaining:</p>\n<blockquote id=\"b317-6\">In this case the Deputy Commissioner found that ... [the sole proprietor] was earning an [AWW] of $573.07____We find in the record competent evidence to support the Deputy Commissioner\u2019s finding, including [the sole proprietorship]^ federal and state quarterly wage reports indicating wages paid to [the sole proprietor], the [sole proprietorship]^ payroll record showing [the sole proprietor]\u2019s wages, and copies of checks written on the [sole proprietorship]^ account to [the sole proprietor] and his landlord for the period January 1989 through November 1989. The Full Commis<page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"286\">*286</page-number>sion made no finding of fact as to [AWW], and instead, replaced the Deputy Commissioner\u2019s finding with \u201cthe ... sole proprietor ] did not earn a net profit during the 52 weeks preceding his injury.\u201d Based on that finding, the Full Commission modified the award to a payment at the minimum rate of $30.00 per week.</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b318-4\">... We find nothing in the statute defining [AWW] nor in the cases interpreting that statute which warrants a conclusion that [the sole proprietor] is entitled to payment at a minimum rate of $30.00 per week based on a finding that his business failed to show a net profit for the fifty-two weeks preceding his injury. Under [the statute], [AWW] must be related to an employee\u2019s earnings, not to his earning capacity. The profit or loss of a business may not necessarily reflect the value of the plaintiffs services to it. Moreover, [the sole proprietor] lawfully elected to be treated as any other employee of [the sole proprietorship] under the sole proprietor provision of the statute. The Commission would not base their award for any other employee on whether or not the employer showed a profit, rather than on the wages paid to the employee.</blockquote>\n<p id=\"b318-5\"><em>Id. </em>at 898-99 (brackets and some internal quotation marks omitted).</p>\n<p id=\"b318-6\">And, in <em>Thompson v. Harold Thompson Trucking, </em>12 Kan.App.2d 449, 748 P.2d 430, 438 (1987), the Court of Appeals of Kansas held that \u201cowner withdrawal\u201d figures were properly used to determine a sole proprietor\u2019s AWW. The sole proprietor, who employed three individuals, was fatally injured as a result of an accident that occurred during the course of his employment. <em>See id. </em>at 432. An administrative law judge determined the sole proprietor\u2019s AWW for the twenty-six weeks preceding the accident to be $216.39. <em>See id. </em>at 437. The evidence demonstrated that, although the sole proprietor did not receive a fixed salary, the sole proprietorship\u2019s account was used to pay his personal expenses. <em>See id. </em>The sole proprietor\u2019s widow testified that she wrote checks on the sole proprietorship\u2019s account for her and the sole proprietor\u2019s personal expenses; the amounts of the checks, for items such <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"287\">*287</page-number>as food, clothing, and insurance, were recorded in the sole proprietorship\u2019s ledger as \u201cowner withdrawal.\u201d <em>See id. </em>None of the checks was made directly payable to the sole proprietor or his widow, although they benefited from the withdrawals. <em>See id. </em>No other evidence of income was presented. <em>See id. </em>In the twenty-six weeks preceding the accident, the sole proprietor was paid $5,626.05 in owner withdrawals for personal expenses, which the administrative law judge divided by twenty-six to calculate an AWW of $216.39. <em>See id. </em>Upon review, the Court noted that, \u201c[generally, profits from a business, whether commercial or farm, are not considered wages for purposes of establishing average wage.\u201d <em>Id. </em>at 438. The Court then held:</p>\n<blockquote id=\"b319-4\">Since many wage earners support their families (paying for their food, clothing, and home and car insurance) from their [AWW], the \u201cowner withdrawals\u201d from [the sole proprietorship] account which were used as wages could reasonably be the basis for [the sole proprietor\u2019s salary. We conclude [that] the ... finding that [the sole proprietor\u2019s [AWW] was $216.39 is supported by substantial competent evidence.</blockquote>\n<p id=\"b319-5\">\n<em>Id.</em>\n</p>\n<p id=\"b319-6\">Analysis</p>\n<p id=\"b319-7\">Here, we hold that the AWW of a sole proprietor who elects coverage under the Act is to be calculated based on the sole proprietorship\u2019s net profit, not on the sole proprietorship\u2019s gross income or gross receipts. We conclude that the sole proprietorship\u2019s net profit is the best approximation of the earnings that a sole proprietor actually takes home because net profit does not include the sole proprietorship\u2019s business costs and expenses. We begin by examining generally how a covered employee\u2019s AWW is calculated. As discussed above, generally, a covered employee\u2019s AWW is calculated based on LE \u00a7 9-602(a) and COMAR 14.09.03.06. COMAR 14.09.03.06A directs the Commission to determine a covered employee\u2019s AWW \u201cfrom gross wages, including overtime[.]\u201d Significantly, neither the Act nor COMAR defines <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"288\">*288</page-number>the term \u201cgross wages,\u201d and neither specifies whether, in the case of a sole proprietor, \u201cgross wages\u201d refers to the sole proprietorship\u2019s gross receipts, net profit, or some other figure.</p>\n<p id=\"b320-4\">We disagree with Long that the term \u201cgross wages\u201d is synonymous with \u201cgross receipts\u201d or \u201cgross income.\u201d Under the Act, for purposes of calculating AWW, \u201cwages shall include: (i) tips; and (ii) the reasonable value of housing, lodging, meals, rent, and other similar advantages that the covered employee received from the employer.\u201d LE \u00a7 9-602(a)(2) (paragraph breaks omitted). And, Black\u2019s Law Dictionary defines \u201cwage\u201d as</p>\n<blockquote id=\"b320-5\">[pjayment for labor or services, usu[ally] based on time worked or quantity produced; specifically], compensation of an employee based on time worked or output of production. Wages include every form of remuneration payable for a given period to an individual for personal services, including salaries, commissions, vacation pay, bonuses, and the reasonable value of board, lodging, payments in kind, tips, and any similar advantage received from the employer.</blockquote>\n<p id=\"Ai5H\">Wage, Black\u2019s Law Dictionary 1811 (10th ed. 2014). In other words, the plain meaning of the term \u201cwages\u201d is compensation or payment in almost any form for an individual\u2019s labor or services. And, as understood in everyday parlance, \u201cwages\u201d are earned by an individual after performing work; <em>i.e., </em>individuals, not business entities, earn wages. Moreover, under the plain language of the Act and COMAR, it is evident that \u201cgross wages\u201d and \u201cwages\u201d refer to an individual\u2019s earnings. Indeed, under COMAR 14.09.03.06A, AWW is calculated \u201cfrom gross wages, including overtime[.]\u201d Common sense dictates that only an individual, and not a business entity, can earn overtime. Similarly, pursuant to LE \u00a7 9 \u2014 602(a)(2)(ii), \u201cwages shall include: ... the reasonable value of housing, lodging, meals, rent, and other similar advantages that the covered employee received from the employer.\u201d (Emphasis added). Stated otherwise, from the plain language of the Act and COMAR 14.09.08.06, as well as the plain and commonsense meaning of the terms, we conclude that \u201cgross wages\u201d <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"289\">*289</page-number>and \u201cwages,\u201d in the context of calculating AWW, refer to an individual\u2019s earnings, and not a business entity\u2019s earnings, even if that business entity is a sole proprietorship. Indeed, the relevant provisions of the Act and COMAR 14.09.03.06 specifically reference the \u201ccovered employee\u201d or \u201cclaimant,\u201d not a covered employee\u2019s or claimant\u2019s business.</p>\n<p id=\"b321-4\">By contrast, \u201cgross income\u201d or \u201cgross receipts\u201d more broadly encompass a business entity\u2019s earnings. For example, Black\u2019s Law Dictionary defines \u201cgross receipts\u201d as \u201c[t]he total amount of money or other consideration received by a business taxpayer for goods sold or services performed in a taxable year, before deductions.\u201d Gross Receipts, Black\u2019s Law Dictionary 819 (10th ed. 2014). Similarly, \u201cgross income\u201d is defined as \u201c[t]otal income from all sources before deductions, exemptions, or other tax reductions.\u201d Gross Income, Black\u2019s Law Dictionary 881 (10th ed. 2014). Thus, \u201cgross income\u201d and \u201cgross receipts\u201d are broader terms that may include not only an individual\u2019s earnings, but also a business entity\u2019s earnings. It does not follow, however, that \u201cgross wages\u201d is synonymous with \u201cgross income\u201d and \u201cgross receipts,\u201d especially in light of the circumstance that \u201cgross wages\u201d is a narrower term that is aimed at capturing an individual\u2019s earnings, and does not refer to anything that is related to a business entity\u2019s earnings, as, unlike an individual, a business entity cannot earn overtime or have lodging or meals in the ordinary sense.</p>\n<p id=\"b321-5\">Further still, \u201cgross income\u201d and \u201cgross receipts\u201d are distinct from \u201cnet profit.\u201d As just mentioned, \u201cgross income\u201d and \u201cgross receipts\u201d are figures that do not take into account any deductions. Thus, a business entity\u2019s \u201cgross income\u201d or \u201cgross receipts\u201d includes the business\u2019s costs and expenses. By contrast, \u201cnet profit\u201d is \u201c[tjotal sales revenue less the cost of the goods sold and all additional expenses.\u201d Net Profit, Black\u2019s Law Dictionary 1404 (10th ed. 2014). As demonstrated by Long\u2019s 2011 Schedule C, in this case, the Employer\u2019s net profit was calculated by subtracting the total business expenses from the Employer\u2019s gross income. Thus, net profit does not include a business\u2019s costs and expenses that often <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"290\">*290</page-number>have little or nothing to do with an employee, such as advertising, depreciation, vehicle rentals, supplies, and utilities.</p>\n<p id=\"b322-4\">Significantly, in this case, as a self-employed sole proprietor, Long did not earn \u201cwages,\u201d and instead claimed only business income on his 2011 federal individual income tax return. Similarly, the 2011 Schedule C did not include any business expense for \u201cwages.\u201d Having not earned wages, and thus lacking any gross wages, the standard AWW calculation that is contemplated by the Act and COMAR 14.09.03.06 simply cannot be used in Long\u2019s case. It is undisputed that Long did not earn wages from the Employer. Moreover, as a sole proprietor, Long would not have received vacation wages or been involuntarily laid off by the Employer, as set forth in COMAR 14.09.03.06B. Accordingly, in this situation, where a self-employed sole proprietor seeks workers\u2019 compensation benefits, the Commission is not bound by an initial award calculation; instead, the Commission \u201ccan determine an accurate [AWW] at the first hearing\u201d based on evidence that is presented by the parties. COMAR 14.09.03.06C(2); <em>cf. Gross, </em>331 Md. at 50, 626 A.2d at 62 (This Court held that the Commission could depart from the time period that is set forth in COMAR 14.09.01.05 for purposes of calculating AWW where there is a hearing and where it was appropriate to deviate.).</p>\n<p id=\"b322-5\">Thus, the task in the case of a self-employed sole proprietor who does not earn wages is to determine what measure best approximates the sole proprietor\u2019s \u201cgross wages.\u201d In our view, a sole proprietorship\u2019s net profit is the best approximation of the earnings that a sole proprietor actually takes home because, unlike the sole proprietorship\u2019s gross income or gross receipts, net profit does not include the sole proprietorship\u2019s business costs and expenses. Our holding is consistent with a number of cases from other jurisdictions that have determined that a self-employed individual\u2019s AWW is to be calculated based on net profit. <em>See Vite, </em>377 S.W.3d at 459 (\u201c[T]he Commission\u2019s decision to deduct the business expenses [the sole proprietor] claimed from his gross receipts, as set forth in his 2007 federal tax return, constituted a determination of <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"291\">*291</page-number>[AWW] that was \u2018just and fair to all parties,\u2019 as allowed by [statute].\u201d); <em>Carnahan, </em>821 A.2d at 1124 (Because the driver had \u201cproduced no evidence, other than his tax returns, that would suggest an alternate method of calculating his income, [the Court] agree[d] that the board was correct to use his net profit ... as his \u2018gross earnings.\u2019 \u201d); <em>Stephen, </em>478 S.E.2d at 81 (\u201c[Substantial evidence in the record [ ] supported] a finding that [the subcontractor]^ [AWW] and compensation rate should be based upon his net earnings, [the subcontractor]^ gross earnings having included wages paid to other employees and various business deductions.\u201d); <em>Meredith, </em>466 S.E.2d at 109-10 (The Court affirmed the calculation of a self-employed sole proprietor\u2019s AWW based on net taxable income that was reported by the sole proprietorship, and stated that, \u201c[w]hen the earnings of an injured employee are not amenable to the primary calculation specified in [the statute], the commission properly resorts to such other method of computing [AWW] most nearly approximating the amount which the injured employee earns.\u201d (Citations, brackets, ellipses, and internal quotation marks omitted)).</p>\n<p id=\"b323-4\">In this case, Long determined his self-employment tax liability for the 2011 tax year by using the Employer\u2019s net profit of $16,879; and, on his 2011 federal income tax return, Long claimed income consisting of the Employer\u2019s net profit of $16,879 and a taxable refund or credit of $869. In other words, by his own admission, Long\u2019s take-home earnings in the year of his injury were $16,879, not the Employer\u2019s gross income of $44,606. Using the Employer\u2019s net profit \u2014 which Long himself identified as his income and used for purposes of determining his self-employment tax liability \u2014 as the basis for the calculation of Long\u2019s AWW is reasonable and logical under the circumstances of this case. As the Supreme Court of New Hampshire explained in <em>Carnahan, </em>821 A.2d at 1124, equating \u201cgross earnings\u201d (or, in this case, \u201cgross wages\u201d) with \u201cgross income\u201d would lead to an absurd result in the case of a self-employed individual:</p>\n<blockquote id=\"b323-5\">An independent contractor with a gross income of $200,000 who incurs $150,000 in business expenses would have \u201cgross <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"292\">*292</page-number>earnings\u201d of $200,000. At the same time, an employee who does the same work, receiving a salary of $50,000, while his employer covers business expenses of $150,000, would have only $50,000 in \u201cgross earnings.\u201d Nothing in the statute suggests that self-employed contractors should be entitled to such a windfall.</blockquote>\n<p id=\"b324-4\">Moreover, as the Court of Appeals of South Carolina recognized in <em>Stephen, </em>478 S.E.2d at 80:</p>\n<blockquote id=\"b324-5\">Difficulties are inherent in using gross pay for the purpose of determining the \u201cearnings of the injured employee.\u201d A plethora of business expenses may be encapsulated within the gross pay received. Examples of expenses not included in computing the earnings of a covered person are automobile allowances; mileage expenses; equipment rentals; labor, fuel, repair bills, and insurance; and depreciation of business equipment, interest on business debts, and the purchase price of a saw[.]</blockquote>\n<p id=\"b324-6\">(Citations omitted).</p>\n<p id=\"b324-7\">The analysis of these jurisdictions persuades us that calculating a sole proprietor\u2019s AWW based on the sole proprietorship\u2019s net profit is appropriate. Indeed, in this case, to hold otherwise \u2014 that Long\u2019s AWW should be based on the Employer\u2019s gross receipts \u2014 would lead to a slippery slope and result in the problem that we so carefully sought to avoid in <em>Stevenson, </em>171 Md. at 577, 189 A. at 913 \u2014 namely, that \u201c[c]onceivably[,] workfers who are] injured might be entitled to receive much more by reason of their injuries than they could possibly earn at work.\u201d Ultimately, using a sole proprietorship\u2019s net profit instead of its gross income or gross receipts avoids the pitfall of a possible windfall to the sole proprietor whereby the sole proprietor would receive more compensation by being injured than by working. Additionally, we observe that the Act\u2019s purpose is to \u201cprotect[ ] employees, employers, and the public alike\u201d by \u201cproviding] employees suffering from work-related accidental injuries, regardless of fault, with a certain, efficient, and dignified form of compensation^ and i]n exchange, employees abandon common law remedies, thereby relieving employers from the vagaries of tort <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"293\">*293</page-number>liability.\u201d <em>Polomski v. Mayor &amp; City Council of Balt., </em>344 Md. 70, 76-77, 684 A.2d 1338, 1341 (1996) (citations and footnote omitted). However, as evidenced by LE \u00a7 9-637(a)(1), compensation to a covered employee for permanent total disability for an accidental personal injury is to equal two-thirds of the AWW, not the full AWW. In other words, as demonstrated by the two-thirds formula, although the purpose of workers\u2019 compensation is to protect an employee and provide the employee with compensation, such compensation is not intended to exceed, or even match, what the employee earns on a weekly basis.</p>\n<p id=\"b325-4\">We are unpersuaded by Long\u2019s reliance on <em>Fitzgerald, </em>322 S.E.2d 347, for the contention that his AWW should be based on the Employer\u2019s gross receipts. In <em>Fitzgerald, id. </em>at 348, the Board calculated the independent contractor\u2019s AWW based on his \u201cfull-time wage[,]\u201d awarding compensation at a rate of $135 per week based on the independent contractor\u2019s gross receipts without deducting \u201cproduction costs.\u201d The Court of Appeals of Georgia affirmed the award and rejected the employer\u2019s contention that there was a difference between the terms \u201cfees\u201d and \u201cwages\u201d for purposes of the workers\u2019 compensation act, simply stating: \u201c[I]t is not mandated by definition or otherwise that one make any deductions before calculating the [independent contractor's wages, particularly in view of the fact that [the employer] deducted the workers\u2019 compensation premiums from his gross, rather than net, receipts.\u201d <em>Id. </em>at 349. Significantly, <em>Fitzgerald </em>had an uncomplicated fact pattern involving a very low amount of compensation, and the opinion consists of only four paragraphs. Indeed, the sole issue in the case was whether the independent contractor\u2019s \u201cproduction costs\u201d should have been deducted from his wages before calculating his AWW. <em>See id. </em>at 348. Interestingly, at no point did the Court identify the amount of the independent contractor\u2019s wages or production costs. And the Court\u2019s sole rationale for affirming the Board\u2019s award appears to be that the employer paid insurance premiums that were based on the independent contractor\u2019s gross receipts. <em>See id. </em>at 349. In this case, however, Long seeks to have numerous costs and expenses included in <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"294\">*294</page-number>the calculation of his AWW \u2014 costs and expenses totaling $27,727, as reflected in the 2011 Schedule C, which comprises approximately 62% of the Employer\u2019s gross income of $44,606. Under these circumstances, <em>Fitzgerald </em>provides little guidance or support.</p>\n<p id=\"b326-4\">Instead, we conclude that the reasoning of the Court of Appeals of South Carolina in <em>Stephen, </em>478 S.E.2d 74, is more persuasive. In <em>Stephen, id. </em>at 81, the Court affirmed the calculation of the subcontractor\u2019s AWW and compensation rate based on his net earnings, not his gross earnings, because the subcontractor\u2019s gross earnings included wages that were paid to other employees and various other business expenses that were deducted from the subcontractor\u2019s taxable income. The Court thoroughly explained the problems that arise in using gross receipts for determining AWW, namely, that gross receipts include \u201c[a] plethora of business expenses[.]\u201d <em>Id. </em>at 80. The Court rejected the subcontractor\u2019s contention that his AWW should be based on his gross receipts because that was the figure that was used by the construction company for insurance premiums. <em>See id. </em>at 81. Specifically, the Court held that \u201creimbursements received by [the subcontractor could ]not be the basis for a computation of his \u2018earningsf,]\u2019 \u201d because the statutory language of \u201cearnings of the injured employee\u201d meant \u201cthe actual sum paid to the employee as his wages, not the totality of payments including reimbursements.\u201d <em>Id. </em>In our view, this approach is the correct one because it relies on a self-employed individual\u2019s pre-injury net profit, as reported on his or her taxes, and avoids a windfall to the self-employed individual that can result if business expenses are not deducted and not factored into the calculation of AWW.</p>\n<p id=\"b326-5\">That other jurisdictions have used figures other than a self-employed individual\u2019s net profit in calculating AWW is of no consequence because those cases are distinguishable in that either the self-employed individual had no net profit, or the self-employed individual presented an appropriate alternative income basis on which to base AWW. <em>See, e.g., Mail Boxes, </em>888 P.2d at 778, 780-81 (Because the sole proprietor had <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"295\">*295</page-number>earned no wages in the year that he was injured and was not paid wages, under the provisions of the Arizona Workers\u2019 Compensation Act, the Court held that \u201c[t]he best way to measure the lost earning capacity of a sole proprietor is by the market value of the services performed.\u201d); <em>McAnelly, </em>460 S.E.2d at 895, 898-99 (Although the sole proprietorship did not have any net profit the year preceding the sole proprietor\u2019s injury, because the sole proprietor was paid wages, as shown on the sole proprietorship\u2019s payroll record, those wages should have been the basis for calculating the sole proprietor\u2019s AWW.); <em>Thompson, 748 </em>P.2d at 437-38 (Because the sole proprietor\u2019s widow had presented evidence that checks that were drawn on the sole proprietorship\u2019s account and recorded as \u201cowner withdrawals\u201d were used by the sole proprietor for personal expenses, and because no other evidence of income was presented, the Court concluded that the sole proprietor\u2019s AWW was properly calculated based on the amount of the \u201cowner withdrawals\u201d in the twenty-six weeks preceding the accident.). Simply stated, these cases are distinguishable from the instant case, where the Employer had a net profit the year in which Long was injured, and the evidence presented as to Long\u2019s wages included Long\u2019s tax returns and Schedule C, and did not include some other measure such as \u201cowner withdrawals.\u201d Significantly, none of the courts in <em>Mail Boxes, McAnelly, </em>or <em>Thompson </em>stated that it would be inappropriate to use a self-employed individual\u2019s net profit as the basis for calculating AWW in other circumstances.<footnotemark>14</footnotemark></p>\n<p id=\"b327-4\">We also reject Long\u2019s contention that his AWW should have been based on the Employer\u2019s gross receipts because IWIF <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"296\">*296</page-number>based insurance premiums on the Employer\u2019s gross receipts, and we are unpersuaded that <em>Picanardi, Stevenson, </em>and <em>Crowner </em>compel the result that Long seeks.<footnotemark>15</footnotemark> As explained above, a sole proprietorship\u2019s gross receipts include business costs and expenses that should not be included in a calculation of AWW because such costs and expenses have little to do with the sole proprietor\u2019s labor and services and do not reflect what the sole proprietor takes home in actual wages. And, in any event, <em>Picanardi, Stevenson, </em>and <em>Crowner </em>are distinguishable from the instant case because none of the cases involved a sole proprietor or addressed, let alone mentioned, how to calculate a sole proprietor\u2019s AWW. Moreover, those cases do not stand for the general proposition that a sole proprietor\u2019s AWW must be based on the sole proprietorship\u2019s gross receipts instead of net profit.</p>\n<p id=\"b328-4\">It is evident that, in <em>Picanardi, </em>135 Md. at 96, 108 A. at 484, our holding was based on our interpretation of the legislative <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"297\">*297</page-number>intent of the provisions of the Act as they existed at that time. Specifically, in concluding that the clearly expressed legislative intent prohibited including board as wages where the value of the board was not fixed at the time of hiring, this Court concluded that \u201cit would be unreasonable to hold that it was intended that the premiums and rates of insurance from which the fund to pay losses were derived were to be calculated on a narrower basis than that adopted for the allowance of compensation.\u201d <em>Id. </em>at 96, 108 A. at 484. Stated otherwise, in <em>Picanardi, </em>we held that, because the General Assembly at that time did not permit insurance premiums to be based on the value of board where the value was not fixed at the time of hiring, the General Assembly did not intend insurers to pay compensation to employees based on the value of board. However, as explained in <em>Pennel, </em>133 Md.App. at 295-96, 754 A.2d at 1129, the Act was amended after <em>Picanardi, </em>and subsequent case law had also led to the conclusion that the value of lodging and other advantages could be computed as wages by assigning such items a present cash value. In other words, the reasoning underlying our decision in <em>Picanardi </em>has been superseded by both statute and case law, and is not persuasive in this case. Additionally, we observe that nothing in <em>Picanardi </em>stands for the broad, general proposition that an employee\u2019s AWW must always be based on the same figure from which workers\u2019 compensation insurance premiums are calculated.</p>\n<p id=\"b329-4\">To be sure, in <em>Picanardi, </em>135 Md. at 96, 108 A. at 484, <em>Stevenson, </em>171 Md. at 576-77, 189 A. at 912-13, and <em>Crowner, </em>226 Md. at 612-13, 175 A.2d at 10, this Court noted the correlation between the actual wages that are paid to the employee and the insurance premiums that are charged by the insurer to the employer. Those cases, however, do not hold that insurance premiums dictate calculation of an employee\u2019s AWW. In any event, as we explained above, adopting the position that a sole proprietor\u2019s AWW should be based on a sole proprietorship\u2019s gross receipts because insurance premiums are based on gross receipts would result in an injured sole proprietor\u2019s being able to recover an AWW that is greater <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"298\">*298</page-number>than the sole proprietor\u2019s AWW when he or she is working. In other words, the sole proprietor would receive a windfall by virtue of being injured. We decline to adopt such a general rule that would, in effect, permit a sole proprietor to receive a windfall for being injured.</p>\n<p id=\"b330-4\">Our workers\u2019 compensation jurisprudence and our liberal construction of the Act do not compel a different result. For example, we have stated that, as to cases involving the Act, \u201cwe [ ] endeavor to interpret its provisions liberally, where possible, in order to effectuate the broad remedial purpose of the statutory scheme.\u201d <em>W.M. Schlosser, </em>414 Md. at 204, 994 A.2d at 961 (citation omitted). And, in <em>Breitenbach v. N.B. Handy Co., </em>366 Md. 467, 473, 784 A.2d 569, 572-73 (2001), we stated that, \u201capplying a canon of construction specific to the Act, if the intent of the [General Assembly] is ambiguous or remains unclear, we resolve any uncertainty in favor of the claimant.\u201d (Citations omitted). We also noted, however, that in liberally construing the Act, \u201cwe seek to avoid an interpretation which would lead to an untenable or illogical outcome.\u201d <em>Id. </em>at 472, 784 A.2d at 572 (citation omitted). Here, in our view, there is no ambiguity \u2014 a sole proprietor\u2019s \u201cgross wages\u201d are the sole proprietorship\u2019s net profit, not gross receipts. To hold otherwise would produce the illogical and unreasonable outcome that would create a windfall for sole proprietors, who would be entitled to far greater workers\u2019 compensation benefits than employees who do the same work for the same earnings.</p>\n<p id=\"b330-5\">In sum, we hold that the AWW of a sole proprietor who elects coverage under the Act is to be calculated based on the sole proprietorship\u2019s net profit, not on the sole proprietorship\u2019s gross income. In this case, the Commission was correct in calculating Long\u2019s AWW based on the Employer\u2019s net profit in 2011, the year in which Long sustained his injury. The 2011 Schedule C identified a net profit of $16,879, which was the sole proprietorship\u2019s gross income of $44,606 less total expenses of $27,727. The net profit was the amount that Long identified on his 2011 federal individual income tax return as business income, and was the amount that Long <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"299\">*299</page-number>identified as net profit for purposes of self-employment tax liability. The Commission determined that, in 2011, Long worked from January 1, 2011 to August 19, 2011, a period of thirty-four weeks. Accordingly, Long\u2019s AWW was calculated by dividing the net profit of $16,879 by thirty-four, arriving at an AWW of $496.44. The evidence in the record supports this figure, and the calculation was correctly based on the Employer\u2019s net profit.<footnotemark>16</footnotemark></p>\n<p id=\"b331-5\">JUDGMENT OF THE COURT OF SPECIAL APPEALS AFFIRMED.

Schedule C of the Internal Revenue Service\u2019s Form 1040 shows a sole proprietorship's \"Profit or Loss From Business.\"</p>\n</footnote>\n<footnote label=\"4\">\n<p id=\"b290-6\">. According to IWIF, during the premium audit, Long indicated that his gross wages were $11,747, as he had reported in Schedule C.</p>\n</footnote>\n<footnote label=\"5\">\n<p id=\"b291-5\">. In Schedule SE, the Employer\u2019s net profit was used to calculate Long's self-employment tax liability.</p>\n</footnote>\n<footnote label=\"6\">\n<p id=\"b291-6\">. The business expenses were for the following items: car and truck expenses of $12,346; depreciation of $1,731; insurance of $2,444; office expenses of $3,614; rent or lease of vehicles, machinery, and equipment of $263; supplies of $4,889; deductible meals and entertainment of $1,042; and other expenses of $1,398.</p>\n</footnote>\n<footnote label=\"7\">\n<p id=\"b291-7\">. Although not stated on the form, it appears that Long calculated his gross wages based on the Employer\u2019s net profit between May 15, 2010 and May 15, 2011.</p>\n</footnote>\n<footnote label=\"8\">\n<p id=\"b293-6\">. Curiously, Long did not explain in the affidavit or elsewhere why he needed workers' compensation insurance for the policy year beginning on May 15, 2012, where he had presented evidence that he had not worked since October 31, 2011, and where Long\u2019s counsel subsequently advised the circuit court that Long was not expected to work again.</p>\n</footnote>\n<footnote label=\"9\">\n<p id=\"b293-7\">. Because Long is a sole proprietor and elected to obtain workers' compensation coverage as a covered employee of the Employer, throughout the proceedings before the Commission and the circuit court, the Employer was represented separately by counsel who was working with IWIF. The Employer\u2019s counsel attended the August 12, 2013, rehearing before the Commission, but did not attend the February 12, 2014, hearing before the circuit court.</p>\n</footnote>\n<footnote label=\"10\">\n<p id=\"b295-6\">. The Employer, although a named Respondent, has not filed a brief in this Court and did not participate in oral argument before this Court.</p>\n</footnote>\n<footnote label=\"11\">\n<p id=\"b298-17\">. LE \u00a7 9-637(b) provides, however, that, \"[n]otwithstanding the $45,000 limitation in subsection (a)(3) of this section, the employer or its insurer shall pay the benefit for the period that the covered employee is permanently totally disabled.\u201d</p>\n</footnote>\n<footnote label=\"12\">\n<p id=\"b299-15\">. Pursuant to LE \u00a7 9-309(a), \"[t]he Commission may adopt regulations to carry out this title[,]\" <em>i.e., </em>to carry out the Act. COMAR 14.09.03.06 is one such regulation adopted by the Commission.</p>\n</footnote>\n<footnote label=\"13\">\n<p id=\"b301-9\">. In <em>Watson v. Twin City Fire Ins. Co., </em>143 Md.App. 637, 643, 795 A.2d 771, 774-75 (2002), the Court of Special Appeals explained: \u201cOrdinarily, a sole proprietor cannot receive benefits under the Act, but the [General Assembly] specifically created an exception to that rule with its enactment of [LE] \u00a7 9-227.\u201d</p>\n</footnote>\n<footnote label=\"14\">\n<p id=\"b327-5\">. In holding that the Commission was correct in calculating Long\u2019s AWW based on the Employer's net profit, instead of gross receipts, we do not foreclose the possibility that a future case may require the Commission to determine a sole proprietor\u2019s AWW on some figure other than net profit, if appropriate and if evidence of some other figure is presented to the Commission. For example, as discussed above, a case may arise in which a sole proprietor operated at a loss prior to sustaining an accidental personal injury. <em>See, e.g., Mail Boxes, </em>888 P.2d at 780-81. Under such a circumstance, where the sole proprietorship has a zero or negative net profit, the sole proprietor may present <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"296\">*296</page-number>evidence of something other than net profit as an appropriate basis for calculating his or her AWW. However, because that is not the circumstance before this Court in this case and because the Commission was presented only with using either net profit or gross receipts in calculating Long's <em>AWW </em>\u2014 i.e., Long did not propose some other alternative to net profit other than gross receipts \u2014 we leave that question for another day. The Commission should, however, be cautious in departing from the use of net profit in calculating a sole proprietor\u2019s AWW.</p>\n</footnote>\n<footnote label=\"15\">\n<p id=\"b328-6\">. As an initial matter, as did the Court of Special Appeals, we note that the record in this case does not definitively demonstrate that IWIF based insurance premiums on the Employer\u2019s gross receipts. <em>See Long, 225 </em>Md.App. at 66-67, 123 A.3d at 573 (\"We will assume, for purposes of this appeal, that [Long] is correct in regard to the basis for the premium in 2011, although the matter is not free from doubt.\u201d (Footnote omitted)). For example, in response to a Premium Audit Report for the policy that was effective from May 15, 2010 through May 15, 2011, in a pre-printed form dated May 23, 2011 \u2014 only two months before Long\u2019s accident \u2014 Long stated that employee payroll was zero and that his \"gross wages\u201d were $11,077. At the February 12, 2014 hearing before the circuit court, Long\u2019s counsel claimed that Long \"simply wrote the wrong number down.\u201d What effect, if any, the audit had on IWIF\u2019s calculations of Long\u2019s premiums is unknown. And, before this Court, IWIF disputes that it set premiums based on Long\u2019s actual gross wages/payroll.</p>\n</footnote>\n<footnote label=\"16\">\n<p id=\"b331-13\">. As a final point, we note that, at oral argument, Long's counsel apparently abandoned the position that Long\u2019s AWW should be $1,737.11, as the Commission had originally amended the award to state after Long's request. Instead, Long\u2019s counsel contended that the AWW should have been $1,311.94, which is the Employer's gross receipts of $44,606 divided by thirty-four (the number of weeks that Long worked in 2011). This figure greatly exceeds the $496.44 that the Commission calculated Long\u2019s AWW to be based on the Employer\u2019s net profit. In our view, the significant gap between the AWW of $486.44 and $1,311.94 demonstrates in a very plain way why using net profit to calculate a sole proprietor's AWW is desirable \u2014 Long would receive a windfall by having his AWW based on the Employer\u2019s gross receipts because he would receive compensation at a much higher weekly rate than what he was actually taking home while working.</p>\n</footnote>\n</opinion>\n</casebody>\n",
