The statutory scheme of CP, Title 3: Incompetency and Criminal <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"80\">*80</page-number>Responsibility in Criminal Cases was interpreted previously in <em>Byers v.

Because both cases address common issues of law, we will address the following questions, which we have rephrased in this consolidated opinion:<footnotemark>3</footnotemark></p>\n<blockquote id=\"b113-4\"><page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"81\">*81</page-number>1. Did the Circuit Court err in determining that the statutory scheme, set forth in Criminal Procedure Article \u00a7\u00a7 3\u2014 114 et seq., for the granting and/or revocation of the conditional release of a committed person violates the separation of powers provision found in Article 8 of the Maryland Declaration of Rights and is thus void as unconstitutional?</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b113-5\">2. Did the Circuit Court err in revoking Merchant\u2019s conditional release and ordering his continued commitment for institutional inpatient care and treatment after the ALJ had found that Merchant was eligible for conditional release and had recommended the same?</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b113-6\">3. Did the Circuit Court err in refusing to consider the ALJ\u2019s report and recommendations and refusing to grant Stoddard\u2019s conditional release?</blockquote>\n<p id=\"b113-7\">We shall answer these questions in the affirmative and hold that under CP \u00a7\u00a7 3-114 et seq., the substantial evidence standard applies to a circuit court\u2019s review of an ALJ\u2019s findings of facts and recommendations.</p>\n<p id=\"b113-8\">FACTUAL AND PROCEDURAL BACKGROUND</p>\n<p id=\"Atg\">A. Dennis Merchant</p>\n<p id=\"b113-9\">On April 4, 2000, Dennis Merchant (\u201cMerchant\u201d) was indicted in the Circuit Court for Prince George\u2019s County for attempted carjacking, attempted robbery, second degree assault, attempted theft over $500, and possession of a controlled dangerous substance. Merchant entered a plea of not criminally responsible by reason of insanity on April 24, 2000. The Circuit Court for Prince George\u2019s County found Merchant guilty of attempted carjacking but not criminally responsible at the time of the commission of the offense and committed him to the Department of Health and Mental Hygiene <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"82\">*82</page-number>(\u201cDHMH\u201d or \u201cHealth Department\u201d).<footnotemark>4</footnotemark> Between December 4, 2000 and August 19, 2014, the Circuit Court granted Merchant conditional releases on various occasions but each conditional release was subsequently revoked, resulting in Merchant\u2019s recommitment to DHMH for treatment.</p>\n<p id=\"b114-5\">Merchant\u2019s appeal arises out of the following events. The State filed a petition for revocation of Merchant\u2019s conditional release on August 20, 2014<footnotemark>5</footnotemark> pursuant to CP \u00a7 3 \u2014 121(c).<footnotemark>6</footnotemark> On the same day, a deputy sheriff apprehended Merchant pursuant to a hospital warrant<footnotemark>7</footnotemark> issued by the Circuit Court in accordance with CP \u00a7 3-121 (e) of the Criminal Procedure Article.<footnotemark>8</footnotemark> On February 26, 2015, ALJ D. Harrison Pratt for <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"83\">*83</page-number>the Office of Administrative Hearings (\u201cOAH\u201d or \u201cthe Office\u201d) held a hearing on the State\u2019s petition for revocation at Springfield Hospital Center, where Merchant was committed.<footnotemark>9</footnotemark> In ALJ Pratt\u2019s Report on Revocation of Conditional Release Hearing (\u201cRevocation Report\u201d), he concluded that Merchant \u201csustained his burden of establishing eligibility for conditional release.\u201d ALJ Pratt based his conclusion on testimony presented at the hearing, which he summarized in his Revocation Report. He found by a preponderance of the evidence that:</p>\n<blockquote id=\"b115-5\">1. On or about September 21, 2000, the [c]ourt committed [Merchant] to [DHMH] after a verdict of Not Criminally Responsible for the charge of attempted carjacking.</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b115-6\">2. Subsequently [Merchant] was admitted to Springfield, a hospital under the control and jurisdiction of [DHMH].</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b115-7\">3. On or about July 26, 2013, the [c]ourt granted [Merchant] a conditional release.</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b115-8\">4. [Merchant] remained at Springfield until April 2014 when he was released to a residential placement, Arundel Lodge.</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b115-9\">5. [Merchant] was released on conditions as ordered by the [c]ourt.</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b115-10\">6. On August 19, 2014, the Arundel Lodge Program Manager notified the CFAP [Community Forensic Aftercare Program] that [Merchant] had violated the conditions of his release.</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b116-4\"><page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"84\">*84</page-number>7. [Merchant] violated condition # 1 of his release by going on four separate unauthorized leaves of absence from Arundel Lodge. He violated condition # 5 by refusing to admit himself to Springfield after being told to do so by Arundel Lodge staff.</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b116-5\">8. On August 19, 2014, after receiving correspondence from Arundel Lodge, the CFAP advised the State\u2019s Attorney of [Merchant\u2019s] violations. The State\u2019s Attorney then filed a Petition for Revocation of Conditional Release. The [c]ourt issued a Hospital Warrant, and [Merchant] was returned to Springfield on August 20, 2014. He has been a patient at Springfield since that time.</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b116-6\">9. Upon his return to the hospital[,] his treating psychiatrist was Dr. Ngozi Nwanna.<footnotemark>10</footnotemark></blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b116-7\">10. Initially [Merchant] was irritable with mild mania on his return to to Springfield. He informed Dr. Nwanna that he had convinced his outpatient psychiatrist to decrease his medication dosage. This caused [Merchant] to decompensate.</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b116-8\">11. [Merchant] was diagnosed as having a bipolar condition with psychosis at the time of his readmission to Springfield.</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b116-9\">12. The hospital increased the dosage of his medication, and he quickly stabilized. He is currently stable while taking the appropriate dosage of medicine. He is doing exceptionally well at the hospital, and he has been compliant with those medicines prescribed for his condition. He is employed at the hospital, regularly attends group therapy sessions and is one of the better patients. He is currently free of any symptoms of his mental illness, and he has good insight as to his mental illness as well as sound judgment. He has reached the maximum level of improvement.</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b116-10\">13. Should [Merchant] be granted a conditional release he would again participate in the Arundel Lodge residential program, The staff from Arundel Lodge has agreed that he <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"85\">*85</page-number>may rejoin their program. He would receive mental health treatment through Arundel Lodge, and the staff would monitor his medicines and activities.</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b117-5\">14. Dr. Nwanna and the staff at Springfield are of the opinion that [Merchant] is not now, as the result of any mental illness, a danger to himself or the person or property of others as long as he abides by the proposed conditions of release.</blockquote>\n<p id=\"b117-6\">At the hearing, Merchant also testified on his own behalf. As the Revocation Report summarized, Merchant understood \u201cthat he has a mental illness and is committed to taking his prescribed medications at the dosages prescribed.\u201d Based on the evidence<footnotemark>11</footnotemark> and testimony<footnotemark>12</footnotemark> presented at the hearing, ALJ Pratt concluded that the evidence demonstrates:</p>\n<blockquote id=\"b117-7\">[Merchant] has gained substantial insight into his mental illness and understands the critical connection between his mental health issues and his problems with the law. He has also exhibited insight into the incident that brought him to the Hospital. He has demonstrated significant improvement in his mental health. The evidence demonstrates that [Merchant] has cooperated fully with treatment in the Hospital, is compliant with his prescribed medication, and is committed to succeeding if he is released. [Merchant] also <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"86\">*86</page-number>demonstrated a thorough knowledge of the rules for conditional release and expressed a sincere desire to comply with those conditions. He also exhibited insight into the role that his therapist would play in the community and expressed a willingness to return to the Hospital if it were to become necessary.... Accordingly, I conclude that [Merchant] has established that he would not be a danger to himself or to the person or property of others, as the result of a mental illness, if he were released subject to the proposed conditions.</blockquote>\n<p id=\"b118-5\">ALJ Pratt recommended that Merchant be conditionally released from confinement for a period of five years. Citing CP \u00a7 3-121(h), the Revocation Report also noted that \u201c[w]ithin five (5) days after receipt of this report, the committed person or his attorney, the State\u2019s Attorney, or [DHMH] may file written exceptions to the determination made herein.\u201d<footnotemark>13</footnotemark> No exceptions to the report were filed. The Revocation Report was mailed to the Honorable Sean Wallace of the Circuit Court for Prince George\u2019s County for court action. Copies of the exhibits ALJ Pratt admitted into evidence were also forwarded to Judge Wallace.</p>\n<p id=\"b118-6\">DHMH filed a \u201cMotion to Hold a Hearing on the Record Made Before the Office of Administrative Hearings,\u201d which Merchant joined. In this motion, DHMH requested that Judge Wallace submit on the ALJ\u2019s findings and recommendations, and thereby adopt the Revocation Report and order Merchant\u2019s conditional release. Counsel for Merchant filed a separate memorandum to address the issues of: (1) whether <em>Byers v. State, </em>184 Md.App. 499, 966 A.2d 982 (2009) controlled Merchant\u2019s case, which arises under CP \u00a7 3-121, and (2) the implication of the separation of powers doctrine on Title 3 of CP.<footnotemark>14</footnotemark> The motion and memorandum addressed a <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"87\">*87</page-number>prior Opinion Judge Wallace issued on October 28, 2011 after a hearing on one of Merchant\u2019s earlier revocations of conditional release. In the October 2011 opinion, Judge Wallace concluded that the ALJ procedure under Title 8 was unconstitutional and refused to apply the substantial evidence standard per the interpretation outlined in <em>Byers.</em><footnotemark><em>15</em></footnotemark></p>\n<p id=\"b119-4\">On May 8, 2015, Judge Wallace held a hearing on ALJ Pratt\u2019s recommendations. At this hearing, DHMH asked Judge Wallace to consider its motion and reconsider his October 28, 2011 opinion with regard to his conclusions about the separation of powers doctrine and the Court of Special Appeals interpretation of the law in <em>Byers. </em>Judge Wallace denied DHMH\u2019s motion. He stated, \u201cI am going to also incorporate my prior written [October 28, 2011] opinion in this case and the analysis there .... my position is that you need to present evidence before me to determine whether or not the release of Mr. Merchant would be appropriate.\u201d After allowing the parties to present evidence, and hearing testimony from Dr. Ngozi Nwanna and Merchant, Judge Wallace issued an Opinion and Order on May 28, 2015. In this Opinion and Order, Judge Wallace noted that since January 3, 2001, Merchant \u201chas violated the conditions of his release several times.\u201d Of those times, \u201cthe conditional release was revoked a few times [during] the other times he was continued on conditional release.\u201d<footnotemark>16</footnotemark> Judge Wallace discussed the interpre<page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"88\">*88</page-number>tation of the statutory scheme explained in Byers<footnotemark>17</footnotemark> and the separation of powers doctrine of Article 8 of the Maryland Declaration of Rights. He then concluded that \u201cthe ALJ in a release hearing is performing a judicial function\u201d in violation of the separation of powers doctrine. Judge Wallace rejected the substantial evidence standard discussed in <em>Byers, </em>stating that while \u201c[a] review of the ALJ\u2019s record reveals that there was sufficient evidence to support his recommendation that the defendant be conditionally released again.... The statute that requires the court to defer to [the ALJ\u2019s] recommendation is unconstitutional and thus I do not defer to it.\u201d He further concluded that he was \u201cunpersuaded by [DHMH\u2019s] psychiatrist and the other incomplete evidence, that defendant has shown he would not be a danger if released with the recommended conditions\u201d and revoked Merchant\u2019s conditional release.</p>\n<p id=\"b120-5\">On November 6, 2015, the Court of Special Appeals granted Merchant\u2019s Application for Leave to Appeal. On November 9, 2015, the Court of Special Appeals certified Merchant\u2019s appeal to this Court to answer two certified questions.</p>\n<p id=\"b121-4\"><page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"89\">*89</page-number>B. Marshall Stoddard</p>\n<p id=\"b121-5\">On May 21, 1010, Marshall Stoddard (\u201cStoddard\u201d) was indicted in the Circuit Court for Prince George\u2019s County for first and second-degree attempted sexual offense, first and second-degree attempted rape; first and second-degree assault; and false imprisonment.<footnotemark>18</footnotemark> Stoddard entered a plea of not criminally responsible by reason of insanity on October 5, 2010. On January 7, 2011, Judge Wallace found Stoddard guilty of attempted second-degree sexual offense. He also found Stoddard not criminally responsible at the time of the commission of the offense.<footnotemark>19</footnotemark> The court committed Stoddard to DHMH. On February 24, 2011, an administrative hearing was held to determine Stoddard\u2019s eligibility for release from commitment pursuant to CP \u00a7 3-115.<footnotemark>20</footnotemark> Stoddard appeared at the hearing, waived his right to an evidentiary hearing, and agreed to remain committed to DHMH. Subsequently, Judge Wallace issued an Order of Continued Commitment on March 23, 2011.</p>\n<p id=\"b122-4\"><page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"90\">*90</page-number>On December 27, 2013, Stoddard filed an application for release pursuant to CP \u00a7 3 \u2014 119(b).<footnotemark>21</footnotemark> In a letter dated December 30, 2013, the staff at Thomas B. Finan Center (\u201cFinan Center\u201d) where Stoddard was committed recommended that he be placed on conditional release for a period of five years. On January 10, 2014, ALJ Michael J. Wallace held a hearing on the application for release at the Finan Center. In ALJ Wallace\u2019s \u201cReport on Release Eligibility\u201d (\u201cRelease Report\u201d), he found that Stoddard had sustained his burden of proof for conditional release. CP \u00a7 3-114(d) provides that \u201ca committed person has the burden to establish by a preponderance of the evidence eligibility for discharge or eligibility for conditional release.\u201d<footnotemark>22</footnotemark> ALJ Wallace found by a preponderance of the evidence that:</p>\n<blockquote id=\"b122-5\">1. On January 7, 2011, after a verdict of NCR [not criminally responsible] to second degree attempted sexual offense, the [c]ourt committed [Stoddard] to [DHMH] for inpatient care and treatment.</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b123-4\"><page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"91\">*91</page-number>2. [Stoddard] was initially placed at [Clifton T.] Perkins [Hospital Center], and then transferred to the [Finan] Hospital on September 24, 2012, where he remains today.</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b123-5\">3. Since his admission, [Stoddard] has been able to maintain the highest level of privileges available to him, which includes being off the locked nursing unit for an hour at a time unescorted and community visits with staff supervision. These community visits have been without incident. [Stoddard] has only lost privileges at times due to violations of the hospital smoking policy.</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b123-6\">4. [Stoddard] was required to register as a Tier I sex offender and complied with this after admission. He has also been compliant with subsequent re-registrations.</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b123-7\">5. [Stoddard] has been assigned to a number of groups, including The Courage to Change, Stress Management, Leisure Skill Development, Leisure Awareness, Health Club, Volunteer, Community Leisure Skills, Values, Community Meeting, Release Readiness, Smoking Recovery, Community Leisure Skills, and individual therapy groups. In addition, he regularly attends [Finan] Hospital\u2019s NA/AA Meetings.</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b123-8\">6. [Stoddard] continues to be medication compliant and will ask questions about his medication as he takes them. [Stoddard] also consistently verbalizes his need for medications. No delusions or hallucinations have been noted and when he was asked about his medications, he stated, \u201cI wish I had these medications 20 years ago.\u201d</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b123-9\">7. [Stoddard] has mental disorders diagnosed as Schizoaffective Disorder and History of Polysubstance Abuse on Axis I.</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b123-10\">8. [Stoddard] has been an active participant in treatment since his admission to the [Finan] Hospital. He has been compliant with all aspects of treatment and has been willing to discuss the crime that resulted in the finding of NCR and how his illness impacted his ability to confirm his behaviors to the requirements of the law. [Stoddard] verbalizes acceptance of his responsibility that in order to prevent future incidents, he needs to remain compliant with his medi<page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"92\">*92</page-number>cations, maintain close working relationships with his treatment providers and avoid the stressors that resulted in his decompensation and subsequent crimes.</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b124-5\">9. [Stoddard] is currently prescribed the following psychiatric medications:</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b124-6\">Prolixin 5mg twice daily for Schizoaffective Disorder</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"A-a\">Lamictal 150mg daily for mood stabilization</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"Ab\">Cogentin 2mg at bedtime for prevention of extra-pyramidal symptoms</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b124-7\">Oxcarbazepine 600mg in the morning and 600 mg at bedtime for mood stabilization</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b124-8\">Gabapetin 600mg three times daily for mood stabilization</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"A1N\">Geodon 160mg daily for mood disorder</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"AKd\">Trazodone lOOmg at bedtime for insomnia</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b124-9\">10. [Stoddard] is currently stable and compliant with medication, attends various groups and is active in discussing and preparing for his discharge. [Stoddard] has not been a behavioral problem and has not exhibited any assaultive behavior since being adjudicated NCR.</blockquote>\n<p id=\"b124-10\">Based on the evidence<footnotemark>23</footnotemark> and the testimony<footnotemark>24</footnotemark> presented at the hearing, ALJ Wallace concluded that the evidence was \u201cper<page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"93\">*93</page-number>suasive that [Stoddard] would not be a danger to himself or others if released subject to the proposed conditions\u201d and recommended that Stoddard be conditionally released for five years. Citing CP \u00a7 3 \u2014 116(d), the Release Report noted that \u201c[w]ithin ten (10) days after receipt of this report, the committed person or his attorney, the State\u2019s Attorney, or [DHMH] may file written exceptions to the determination made herein.\u201d <footnotemark>25</footnotemark> No exceptions to the report were filed. The Release Report and copies of the exhibits ALJ Wallace admitted into evidence were forwarded to Judge Wallace.</p>\n<p id=\"b125-5\">On April 4, 2014, Judge Wallace held a hearing on Stoddard\u2019s conditional release. As in Merchant\u2019s case, DHMH filed a \u201cMotion to Hold a Hearing on the Record Made Before the Office of Administrative Hearings.\u201d Judge Wallace denied the motion, explaining that he finds the statute to be unconstitutional for violating the separation of powers doctrine \u201cfor the reasons that I\u2019ve stated previously in writing in State versus Merchant.\u201d Counsel for DHMH and Stoddard objected to the admission of any testimony at the hearing, which Judge Wallace overruled, stating, \u201cI\u2019m going to allow [Stoddard] to present evidence that he thinks might justify my authorizing such a release.\u201d He further stated that \u201cI\u2019m not going to consider the administrative law judge\u2019s thing [Release Report], but there is a copy of it in the file for the record.\u201d He then proceeded to hear testimony from Dr. Okusami, Stoddard\u2019s treating psychiatrist, a social worker who has worked with Stoddard during his time at Finan, and Stoddard himself. At the conclusion of the hearing, Judge Wallace declared that \u201cit certainly seems [Stoddard has] made progress, but I\u2019m not persuaded at this time \u2014 and I\u2019m going to deny the request for conditional release.\u201d</p>\n<p id=\"b125-6\">The Court of Special Appeals granted Stoddard\u2019s application for leave to appeal on June 29, 2015. Prior to any proceedings in the Court of Special Appeals, Stoddard filed a petition for <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"94\">*94</page-number>writ of certiorari in this Court, which we granted.<footnotemark>26</footnotemark> <em>Stoddard v. Dept. of Health and Mental Hygiene, </em>445 Md. 487, 128 A.3d 51 (2015).</p>\n<p id=\"b126-5\">STANDARD OF REVIEW</p>\n<p id=\"b126-6\">\u201cThe interpretation of a statute is a question of law, which we consider <em>de novo.\u201d Harrison-Solomon v. State, </em>442 Md. 254, 265, 112 A.3d 408, 415 (2015). To determine the General Assembly\u2019s intent under the statutory scheme of CP, Title 3, we apply the rules of statutory construction, which this Court has summarized in numerous cases:</p>\n<blockquote id=\"b126-7\">The cardinal rule of statutory interpretation is to ascertain and effectuate the real and actual intent of the Legislature. A court\u2019s primary goal in interpreting statutory language is to discern the legislative purpose, the ends to be accomplished, or the evils to be remedied by the statutory provision under scrutiny.</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b126-8\">To ascertain the intent of the General Assembly, we begin with the normal, plain meaning of the statute. If the language of the statute is unambiguous and clearly consistent with the statute\u2019s apparent purpose, our inquiry as to the legislative intent ends ordinarily and we apply the statute as written without resort to other rules of construction. We neither add nor delete language so as to reflect an intent not evidenced in the plain and unambiguous language of the statute, and we do not construe a statute with forced or subtle interpretations that limit or extend its application. We, however, do not read statutory language in a vacuum, nor do we confine strictly our interpretation of a statute\u2019s <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"95\">*95</page-number>plain language to the isolated section alone. Rather, the plain language must be viewed within the context of the statutory scheme to which it belongs, considering the purpose, aim, or policy of the Legislature in enacting the statute. We presume that the Legislature intends its enactments to operate together as a consistent and harmonious body of law, and, thus, we seek to reconcile and harmonize the parts of a statute, to the extent possible consistent with the statute\u2019s object and scope. Where the words of a statute are ambiguous and subject to more than one reasonable interpretation, or where the words are clear and unambiguous when viewed in isolation, but become ambiguous when read as part of a larger statutory scheme, a court must resolve the ambiguity by searching for legislative intent in other indicia, including the history of the legislation or other relevant sources intrinsic and extrinsic to the legislative process. In resolving ambiguities, a court considers the structure of the statute, how it relates to other laws, its general purpose and relative rationality and legal effect of various competing constructions.</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b127-5\">In every case, the statute must be given a reasonable interpretation, not one that is absurd, illogical or incompatible with common sense.</blockquote>\n<p id=\"b127-6\"><em>Gardner v.

Laws, Chap. 501. The purpose of Senate Bill 645 was to \u201crevise, restate, and recodify the laws relating to incompetency and criminal responsibility in criminal cases.\u201d Senate Judicial Proceedings Committee, Summary of Committee Report, S.B. 645 at 3 (Md.1984) (hereinafter Summary of Committee Report). The Summary of Committee Report further provided that \u201c[t]he purpose of the bill is to implement <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"96\">*96</page-number>the recommendations of the Task Force<footnotemark>27</footnotemark> in an effort to streamline and strengthen, where necessary, the procedures for the defense of not criminally \u2018responsible\u2019 in Maryland.\u201d <em>Id. </em>Senate Bill 645 was originally codified in Md.Code (1982, 1989 Cum.Supp.), \u00a7 12-101 et.seq., of the Health-General Article (\u201cHG\u201d) and later recodified as Title 8 of CP.</p>\n<p id=\"b128-5\">In both cases before us, the Circuit Court concluded that the statutory scheme set forth in CP \u00a7\u00a7 3-114 et seq., for the granting and/or revoking of the conditional release of a committed person is unconstitutional. All parties contend that this conclusion was in error. It is well documented that State statutes enjoy \u201ca strong presumption of constitutionality.\u201d <em>Burruss v. Bd. of Cty. Commissioners of Frederick Cty., </em>427 Md. 231, 263, 46 A.3d 1182, 1201 (2012). Furthermore, \u201c[w]e do not presume that the Legislature intended to enact unconstitutional legislation and, if it did so intend, we would limit a statute to only those situations in which it would pass constitutional muster.\u201d <em>Harrison-Solomon, </em>442 Md. at 287, 112 A.3d at 428. While the Honorable Charles E. Moylan, Jr. did not specifically address the constitutionality of Title 3 in <em>Byers, </em>his analysis properly proceeded on the presumption that Title 3 is constitutional. We begin our discussion on the same premise.</p>\n<p id=\"b128-6\">The Separation of Powers Doctrine</p>\n<p id=\"b128-7\">In Maryland, the separation of powers doctrine is embodied in Article 8 of the Maryland Declaration of Rights.<footnotemark>28</footnotemark> We recently stated that this \u201cdoctrine does not, however, rigidly establish strict lines of demarcation between the three branches of government.\u201d <em>Meyer v. State, </em>445 Md. 648, 672, <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"97\">*97</page-number>128 A.3d 147, 161 (2015). We have repeatedly recognized the concept of constitutional elasticity. <em>See Meyer, </em>445 Md. at 673, 128 A.3d at 162 (\u201cIn Maryland, we have applied this \u2018sensible degree of elasticity\u2019 when alleged violations of the separation of powers doctrine occurred.\u201d); <em>McCulloch v. Glendening, </em>347 Md. 272, 284, 701 A.2d 99, 105 (1997) (\u201cThus, the separation of powers doctrine does not require absolute separation between the branches of government.\u201d); <em>Dep\u2019t of Nat. Res. v. Linchester Sand &amp; Gravel Corp., </em>274 Md. 211, 220, 334 A.2d 514, 521 (1975) (\u201cWe believe this to be permissible, within limits, as the separation of powers concept may constitutionally encompass a sensible degree of elasticity and should not be applied with doctrinaire rigor.\u201d). In <em>Linchester Sand &amp; Gravel Corp., </em>we specifically discussed the separation of powers doctrine as it pertains to administrative agencies:</p>\n<blockquote id=\"b129-5\">In response to the practical needs of government, not only has there been an extensive introduction of these administrative agencies in this State, as is true in most if not all of our sister states, but in addition, as a consequence of this need, there has occurred within these agencies some mingling, blending and overlapping of the legislative, executive and judicial functions. We believe this to be permissible, within limits, as the separation of powers concept may constitutionally encompass a sensible degree of elasticity and should not be applied with doctrinaire rigor.</blockquote>\n<p id=\"b129-6\">274 Md. at 220, 334 A.2d at 521. The concept of constitutional elasticity is not, however, without limits. \u201c[Cjonstitutional \u2018elasticity1 cannot be stretched to a point where, in effect, there no longer exists a separation of governmental power, as the Maryland Constitution does not permit a merger of the three branches of our State government, nor does it \u2018make any one of the three departments subordinate to the other, when exercising the trust committed to it.\u2019\u201d <em>Id. </em>(citation omitted).</p>\n<p id=\"b129-7\">The appellants, Merchant and Stoddard, argue that the interpretation of the statutory scheme in <em>Byers </em>was correct, applicable to their cases, and the Circuit Court erred by declining to apply this precedent. Pursuant to <em>Byers, </em>there was substantial evidence to support the ALJ\u2019s recommenda<page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"98\">*98</page-number>tion to release Merchant and Stoddard, respectively. Therefore, Merchant and Stoddard ask that we reverse the judgment of the Circuit Court and direct the Circuit Court to approve the ALJ\u2019s recommendations in their respective cases.</p>\n<p id=\"b130-5\">In contrast, Appellees DHMH and the Criminal Appeals Division of the Office of the Attorney General (\u201cthe Criminal Appeals Division\u201d) argue that the intermediate appellate court was mistaken in <em>Byers </em>when it concluded the statutory scheme of Title 3 imposed a substantial evidence review requirement on the Circuit Court. They claim that the <em>Byers </em>interpretation violates the separation of powers doctrine because requiring the court to review the ALJ decision for substantial evidence results in an impermissible delegation of judicial authority to the executive branch. Both appellees suggest alternative interpretations of the statutory scheme of Title 3.</p>\n<p id=\"b130-6\">DHMH contends that the proper role of the Circuit Court is to rely on the record developed in the OAH and accord deference to the purely factual findings of the ALJ but to make its own conclusion on the merits of the case. It analogizes the role of the ALJ under Title 3 to that of the use of masters, now magistrates. Citing <em>In re Marcus </em>J., 405 Md. 221, 950 A.2d 787 (2008), DHMH explains that courts may delegate the process of fact finding and the making of recommendations to a magistrate, but a magistrate may not exercise the judicial authority of rendering ultimate determinations. Based on its interpretation of the statutory scheme, DHMH asserts that the Circuit Court erred in both Merchant\u2019s and Stoddard\u2019s cases because the uncontroverted evidence before the Circuit Court was that Merchant and Stoddard, respectively, would not be a danger to himself or others. Meanwhile, the Criminal Appeals Division espouses the view that the court has the inherent authority to hold a supplemental evidentiary hearing. Based on its interpretation of the law, the Criminal Appeals Division concludes that the Circuit Court did not err when it refused to grant Merchant and Stoddard a conditional release. In Merchant\u2019s case, the Criminal Appeals Division states that Merchant\u2019s long history of violations of conditional release properly rebutted the testimony of his <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"99\">*99</page-number>treating psychiatrists. In Stoddard\u2019s case, the Division states that based on the exceptional violence of Stoddard\u2019s crime, the court properly found that Stoddard did not meet his burden of proving by a preponderance of the evidence that he would not be a danger to himself or others if conditionally released. We address the interpretations proposed by DHMH and the Criminal Appeals Division below and conclude that the interpretation of Title 3 in <em>Byers </em>is more persuasive and does not violate the separation of powers doctrine.</p>\n<p id=\"b131-5\">In <em>Byers, </em>the Judge Moylan performed a detailed examination of CP, Title 3. He described the statutory scheme as calling \u201cfor release or discharge to be a hybrid determination engaging both the executive branch and the judicial branch in the decisional process.\u201d <em>Byers, </em>184 Md.App. at 505, 966 A.2d at 986. DHMH and OAH \u201cact on behalf of the executive branch\u201d while \u201c[t]he circuit court acts for the judicial branch.\u201d <em>Id. </em>The statutory scheme here prescribes mandatory judicial review. Generally, an \u201cadministrative decision takes effect and is a final resolution of the problem\u201d if no petition for judicial review is taken. <em>Byers, </em>184 Md.App. at 511-12, 966 A.2d at 990. Title 3 presents a situation where the administrative decision is not \u201cself-executing,\u201d rather, \u201c[a] judge must \u2018sign off on the release or discharge.\u201d <em>Byers, </em>184 Md.App. at 511, 966 A.2d at 990. This occurs because a person found not criminally responsible is \u201ccommitted\u201d by the circuit court, so only the circuit court may \u201cuncommit\u201d the person. <em>Id. </em>Judge Moylan concluded that \u201cthe basic release or discharge determination is intended to be an administrative decision to be made within the executive branch of government, subject only to judicial monitoring of its procedural propriety, and is not intended to be something that segues into an actual judicial determination on the ultimate merits.\u201d <em>Byers, </em>184 Md.App. at 514, 966 A.2d at 991. Therefore, the role of the circuit court is to determine whether the evidence \u201cwas substantial enough to support the conclusions and the recommendation of the ALJ.\u201d <em>Byers, </em>184 Md.App. at 532, 966 A.2d at 1002.</p>\n<p id=\"b132-4\"><page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"100\">*100</page-number>Judge Moylan\u2019s interpretation of the statutory scheme in <em>Byers </em>does not violate the separation of powers doctrine. Generally, judicial review of an administrative hearing is a creature of statute rather than a constitutional or common law right. <em>Parlato v. State Comm\u2019n on Human Relations, </em>76 Md.App. 695, 698, 548 A.2d 144, 145-46 (1988) <em>cert. denied, </em>314 Md. 497, 551 A.2d 867 (1989); <em>see also Criminal Injuries Compensation Board v. Gould, </em>273 Md. 486, 500, 331 A.2d 55 (1975). We also note that the circuit courts \u201chave an inherent power to review administrative agency decisions.\u201d <em>Anne Arundel Cty. v. Halle Dev., Inc., </em>408 Md. 539, 556, 971 A.2d 214, 224 (2009). The circuit court\u2019s power \u201cin reviewing an administrative agency adjudicatory decision is narrow[.] [I]t is limited to determining if there is substantial evidence in the record as a whole to support the agency\u2019s findings and conclusions, and to determine if the administrative decision is premised upon an erroneous conclusion of law.\u201d <em>Cosby v. Dep\u2019t of Human Res., </em>425 Md. 629, 638, 42 A.3d 596, 601 (2012) (citing <em>Board of Physician Quality Assurance v. Banks, </em>354 Md. 59, 67-68, 729 A.2d 376, 380 (1999)). CP \u00a7 3-116 provides:</p>\n<blockquote id=\"b132-5\">(a) <em>In general. </em>Within 10 days after the hearing ends, the Office shall prepare a report of recommendations to the court that contains:</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b132-6\">(1) a summary of the evidence presented at the hearing;</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b132-7\">(2) recommendations of the Office as to whether the committed person proved, by a preponderance of the evidence, eligibility for conditional release or eligibility for discharge; and</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b132-8\">(3) if the Office determines that the committed person proved eligibility for conditional release, the recommended conditions of the release in accordance with subsection (b) of this section.</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b132-9\">(b) <em>Consideration of conditions for release. </em>In recommending the conditions of a conditional release, the Office shall give consideration to any specific conditions recommended by the facility of the Health Department that has charge of <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"101\">*101</page-number>the committed person, the committed person, or counsel for the committed person.</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b133-5\">(c) <em>Copies of report. </em>The Office shall send copies of the report of recommendations:</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b133-6\">(1) to the committed person;</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b133-7\">(2) to counsel for the committed person;</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b133-8\">(3) to the State\u2019s Attorney;</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b133-9\">(4) to the court; and</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b133-10\">(5) to the facility of the Health Department that has charge of the committed person.</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b133-11\">(d) <em>Exceptions. </em>The committed person, the State\u2019s Attorney, or the Health Department may file exceptions to the report of the Office within 10 days after receiving the report.</blockquote>\n<p id=\"b133-12\">CP \u00a7 3-117 provides:</p>\n<blockquote id=\"b133-13\">(a) <em>In general. </em>Within 30 days after the court receives the report of recommendations from the Office:</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b133-14\">(1) the court on its own initiative may hold a hearing; or</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b133-15\">(2) if timely exceptions are filed, or if the court requires more information, the court shall hold a hearing unless the committed person and the State\u2019s Attorney waive the hearing.</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b133-16\">(b) <em>Conduct of hearing. </em>(1) The court shall hold the hearing on the record that was made before the Office.</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b133-17\">(2) At the judicial hearing, the committed person is entitled to be present and to be represented by counsel.</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b133-18\">(3) The court may continue its hearing and remand for the Office to take additional evidence.</blockquote>\n<p id=\"b133-19\">Pursuant to CP \u00a7 3-116, no conclusive action in a case is taken until the circuit court acts. As Judge Moylan explained, the language of CP \u00a7 3-117(b)(l) \u201cmandates that the court hearing shall be \u2018on the record that was made before the Office\u2019\u201d and \u201c[m]ost significantly, subsection [CP \u00a7 3-117](b)(3) then goes on to prescribe the steps that need to be taken in case further evidence should be needed.\u201d <em>Byers, </em>184 Md.App. at 514, 966 A.2d at 991. Specifically, the circuit court <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"102\">*102</page-number>must remand to OAH for the taking of additional evidence. What is unique about the statutory power of judicial review described here is that it is mandatory. This does not render the procedure unconstitutional, rather, given the unique judiciary-executive branch hybrid at play, it avoids the separation of powers problem that would otherwise arise. An individual who has committed a crime but is found not criminally responsible is not sanctioned, instead, the remedy is treatment under the aegis of DHMH. <em>Harrison-Solomon, </em>442 Md. at 286-87, 112 A.3d at 428. As Judge Moylan noted, it is, however, the circuit court that commits the individual, therefore, only the circuit court may release, conditionally or otherwise, the individual. To allow an ALJ\u2019s findings and recommendations to go into effect automatically under the judiciary-executive hybrid created under Title 3 would beget the impermissible situation where the judicial branch is made subordinate to the executive branch, stretching the concept of constitutional elasticity \u201cto a point where, in effect, there no longer exists a separation of governmental power.\u201d <em>Linchester Sand &amp; Gravel Corp., </em>274 Md. at 220, 334 A.2d at 521. As explained above, the substantial evidence standard of review put forth by Judge Moylan is the commonly accepted standard for court review of administrative decisions and does not, as the appellees contend, impermissibly delegate judicial authority to the executive branch.</p>\n<p id=\"b134-4\">To give a circuit court the authority to make its own decision on the merits of the case as suggested by DHMH or hold its own <em>de novo </em>hearing as proposed by the Criminal Appeals Division would yield a result that violates the separation of powers doctrine. <em>See Linchester Sand &amp; Gravel Corp., </em>274 Md. at 229, 334 A.2d at 525-26 (striking down the subparagraph of the statute which \u201cin substance provides for a de novo trial free of the Administrative Procedure Act.\u201d). The DHMH\u2019s analogy overlooks a significant distinguishing feature between the role of a juvenile magistrate and the role of an ALJ. Magistrates are arms of the judiciary whereas ALJs perform executive functions. Article IV, \u00a7 9, of our State Constitution authorizes the circuit courts \u201cto appoint masters <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"103\">*103</page-number>as officers of the court,\u201d giving a magistrate a ministerial role. <em>Harryman v. State, </em>359 Md. 492, 505, 754 A.2d 1018, 1025 (2000); <em>see also In re Marcus J., </em>405 Md. at 235, 950 A.2d at 795. Because a magistrate functions as part of the judiciary, there is no separation of powers issue when the circuit court makes its own decision on the merits of the case or holds a <em>de novo </em>hearing \u2014 all actions occur within the judiciary branch. To apply this procedure to the role of the ALJ under Title 3, however, creates a separation of powers problem because it would allow a circuit court, exercising judicial authority, to essentially \u201cassume or discharge the duties of\u2019 an ALJ\u2019s exercise of executive power. Md. Decl. of Rts. art. 8. Therefore, we agree with Judge Moylan that pursuant to Title 3, the General Assembly, consistent with the separation of powers doctrine, intended for a circuit court judge to apply the substantial evidence standard to its review of an ALJ\u2019s findings of facts and recommendation.</p>\n<p id=\"b135-4\">The Statutory Scheme</p>\n<p id=\"b135-5\">All parties point to CP \u00a7 3-118 as the source of ambiguity in the statutory scheme. CP \u00a7 3-118 describes the action to be taken by a court upon receiving a report from OAH, providing in pertinent part:</p>\n<blockquote id=\"b135-6\">(a) <em>In General. </em>Within 15 days after a judicial hearing ends or is waived, the court shall determine whether the evidence indicates that the committed person proved by a preponderance of the evidence eligibility for release, with or without conditions, in accordance with \u00a7 3-114 of this title, and enter an appropriate order containing a concise statement of the findings of the court, the reasons for those findings, and ordering:</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b135-7\">(1) continued commitment;</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b135-8\">(2) conditional release; or</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b135-9\">(3) discharge from commitment.</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b135-10\">(b) <em>Order without hearing. </em>(1) If timely exceptions are not filed, and, on review of the report of recommendations from the Office, the court determines that the recommendations are supported by the evidence and a judicial hearing is not <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"104\">*104</page-number>necessary, the court shall enter an order in accordance with the recommendations within 30 days after receiving the report from the Office. (2) A court may not enter an order that is not in accordance with the recommendations from the Office unless the court holds a hearing or the hearing is waived.</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b136-5\">(e) <em>Appeals. </em>(1) An appeal from a District Court order shall be on the record in the circuit court.</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b136-6\">(2) An appeal from a circuit court order shall be by application for leave to appeal to the Court of Special Appeals.</blockquote>\n<p id=\"b136-7\">Judge Moylan also acknowledged that it is ambiguous whether CP \u00a7 3-118(a) requires the court to be persuaded of eligibility for release \u201cby a preponderance of the evidence,\u201d or requires the court to determine whether there was substantial evidence for the ALJ to have been persuaded \u201cby a preponderance of the evidence.\u201d <em>Byers, </em>184 Md.App. at 517, 966 A.2d at 993. The Criminal Appeals Division contends that the language of CP \u00a7 3-118(b) does not alter the interpretation of CP \u00a7 3-118(a). Instead, the Criminal Appeals Division argues that the plain language of CP 3-118(a) \u201callows the court to make its own determinations\u201d and gives the court discretion \u201cto hold a hearing under any circumstances.\u201d The Criminal Appeals Division\u2019s contention ignores the fact that \u201c[t]he meaning of the plainest language is controlled by the context in which it appears.\u201d <em>Md.-Nat\u2019l Capital Park &amp; Planning Comm\u2019n v. Anderson, </em>395 Md. 172, 182, 909 A.2d 694, 700 (2006) (internal quotation marks omitted) (citing <em>State v. Pagano, </em>341 Md. 129, 133, 669 A.2d 1339, 1341 (1996)). As Judge Moylan recognized in <em>Byers, </em>an isolated reading of CP \u00a7 3-118(a), \u201cwould seem to indicate that it is the judge who must be personally persuaded that release or discharge is called for rather than an indication that the judge must only be satisfied, as a matter of law, that the evidence was sufficient for the ALJ to have been so persuaded.\u201d <em>Byers, </em>184 Md.App. at 517, 966 A.2d at 993. The language of subsections (b) and (e), however, seems to indicate otherwise:</p>\n<blockquote id=\"b137-4\"><page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"105\">*105</page-number>Subsection (b)(1) deals with the situation in which no exceptions have been filed to the recommendations of the ALJ and the Board. In such a case, the court does not take evidence or presume to engage in fact-finding of its own. It simply reviews the report from the Office [of Administrative Hearings] to see if the ALJ\u2019s <em>\u201crecommendations are supported by the evidence \u201d </em>(emphasis supplied), and, if so, the court \u201cshall enter an order in accordance with the recommendations.\u201d This is the classic language of administrative appeals. The court, in a quasi-appellate capacity, monitors the action that has been taken by the ALJ and determines whether the recommendations are supported by substantial evidence. It does not presume to second-guess the recommendations on their merits.</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b137-5\">Subsection (b)(2) goes on to provide that if the circuit court judge is not going to follow the recommendations of the ALJ, the court must hold a hearing unless the hearing is waived. This seems to be nothing but the affording of an opportunity to the lawyers to argue the case.</blockquote>\n<p id=\"b137-6\"><em>Byers, </em>184 Md.App. at 518-19, 966 A.2d at 994. Furthermore, CP \u00a7 3-118(e)(2) provides that \u201c[a]n appeal from a circuit court order shall be by application for leave to appeal to the Court of Special Appeals\u201d rather than of right to the Court of Special Appeals. Judge Moylan explained that because the statute does not provide for an automatic right to an appeal to the intermediate appellate court, this is \u201ca further indication that [the Court of Special Appeals] would not in such a case be reviewing a <em>de novo </em>decision of the circuit court but would only be entertaining an administrative appeal that had already enjoyed one level of judicial review.\u201d <em>Byers, </em>184 Md.App. at 519, 966 A.2d at 994.</p>\n<p id=\"b137-7\">Judge Moylan also discussed, in <em>Byers, </em>CP \u00a7 3-119, which delineates how a committed person may apply for release:</p>\n<blockquote id=\"b137-8\">(a) <em>In general. </em>(1) Not earlier than 1 year after the initial release hearing ends or was waived, and not more than once a year thereafter, a committed person may apply for release <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"106\">*106</page-number>under either subsection (b) or (c) of this section, but not both.</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b138-5\">(2)Notwithstanding the time restrictions in paragraph (1) of this subsection, a committed person may file an application for release at any time if the application is accompanied by an affidavit of a physician or licensed psychologist that states an improvement in the mental condition of the committed person since the last hearing.</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b138-6\">(b) <em>Administrative Procedure. </em>(1) To apply for release under this subsection, the committed person shall file an application for release with the Health Department and notify the court and State\u2019s Attorney, in writing, of this request.</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b138-7\">(2) The provisions of this title governing administrative hearing and judicial determination of eligibility for release apply to any application for release under this subsection.</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b138-8\">(c) <em>Court procedure. </em>(1) To apply for release under this subsection, the committed person shall file a petition for release with the court that ordered commitment.</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b138-9\">(2) The committed person shall send a copy of the petition for release to the Health Department and the State\u2019s Attorney.</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b138-10\">(3) If the committed person requests a trial by jury, the trial shall be held in a circuit court with a jury as in a civil action at law.</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b138-11\">(4) The trier of fact shall:</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b138-12\">(i) determine whether the committed person has proved eligibility for release by a preponderance of the evidence; and</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b138-13\">(ii) render a verdict for:</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b138-14\">1. continued commitment;</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b138-15\">2. conditional release; or</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b138-16\">3. discharge from commitment.</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b138-17\">(5) If the trier of fact renders a verdict for conditional release, within 30 days after the verdict, the court shall release the committed person under conditions it imposes in <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"107\">*107</page-number>accordance with specific recommendations for conditions under \u00a7 3 \u2014 116(b) of this title.</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b139-5\">(d) <em>Appeals. </em>(1) An appeal from a District Court order shall be on the record in the circuit court.</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b139-6\">(2) An appeal from a circuit court order shall be by application for leave to appeal to the Court of Special Appeals.</blockquote>\n<p id=\"Aqk\">The Criminal Appeals Division asserts that the presence of two different methods for obtaining court review does not divest a circuit court of its authority to make its own decision on the merits of the case, regardless of which avenue of release the committed person selects. This contention cannot stand because it would render the language of CP \u00a7 3-119(a) \u201csuperfluous[ ] or nugatory.\u201d <em>Bd. of Educ. of Howard Cty. v. Howard Cty. Educ.

CP \u00a7 3-119 explicitly provides two modalities for a committed individual\u2019s subsequent applications for release, an \u201cAdministrative procedure\u201d under CP \u00a7 3-119(b) and a \u201cCourt procedure\u201d under CP \u00a7 3-119(c). As Judge Moylan emphasized, \u201c[sjubsection (a) further provides that \u2018a committed person may apply for release under <em>either subsection (b) or (c) </em>of this section, <em>but not both.\u2019 </em>\u201d <em>Byers, </em>184 Md.App. at 505-06, 966 A.2d at 986 (emphasis in original). A committed person opts for the \u201cAdministrative procedure\u201d by filing an application for release with DHMH pursuant to CP \u00a7 3-119(b)(l). A hearing before an ALJ follows.<footnotemark>29</footnotemark> A committed person also has the option to file his or her petition for release directly with the circuit court under the \u201cCourt procedure\u201d of CP \u00a7 3-119(c). When a committed person selects the \u201cCourt procedure\u201d there is no prior administrative activity; the committed person selects a trial by jury or a bench trial. If the committed person selects a bench trial, the trial judge serves as the fact-finder, and determines whether the person has proved eligibility for release by a preponderance of the evidence and renders a verdict. If the committed person opts <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"108\">*108</page-number>for the \u201cAdministrative procedure,\u201d the circuit court has no role until it receives a report from the ALJ. For a circuit court to hold its own evidentiary hearing when it is clear that the committed person selected the administrative route merges the two modalities of review which is inconsistent with the clear mandate of CP \u00a7 3-119(a).</p>\n<p id=\"b140-5\">In addition, as previously discussed, the General Assembly intended to create a statute to \u201cstreamline and strengthen ... the procedures for the defense of not criminally \u2018responsible\u2019 in Maryland.\u201d Summary of Committee Report at 3. For a court to hold its own evidentiary hearing on the merits of the case when the committed individual selected the administrative procedure available under CP \u00a7 3 \u2014 119(b)(1), as Stoddard did, would be repetitive because much of the testimony that would be presented is the same as that which was presented before the ALJ. This certainly would not be a streamlined procedure.</p>\n<p id=\"b140-6\">We also note that even where the committed person selects the \u201cCourt procedure,\u201d CP \u00a7 3 \u2014 119(c)(5) provides that \u201c[i]f the trier of fact renders a verdict for conditional release ... the court shall release the committed person under conditions it imposes in accordance with specific recommendations for conditions under [CP] \u00a7 3 \u2014 116(b).\u201d These \u201cspecific recommendations for conditions under [CP] \u00a7 3-116(b)\u201d are the conditions of release recommended by an ALJ. CP \u00a7 3 \u2014 116(b) provides: \u201cIn recommending the conditions of a conditional release, the Office shall give consideration to any specific conditions recommended by the facility of [DHMH] that has charge of the committed person, the committed person, or counsel for the committed person.\u201d It is apparent that the statutory provisions require a circuit court to defer to OAH\u2019s recommendations as to the conditions of release even where a committed person initiates the \u201cCourt procedure\u201d in a circuit court. This is an indication that under the statutory scheme, generally, the General Assembly did not intend for the court to have anything more than the power of judicial review. The language found elsewhere in Title 3 providing the court with the <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"109\">*109</page-number>power of judicial review reinforces this conclusion. <em>See </em>discussion of CP \u00a7 3-117 <em>supra.</em></p>\n<p id=\"b141-5\">CP \u00a7 3-121, under which Merchant\u2019s case arises, also provides valuable insight into the statutory scheme. This section provides the procedure to be followed when a committed person has allegedly violated conditions of conditional release. CP \u00a7 3-121 describes in pertinent part:</p>\n<blockquote id=\"b141-6\">(f) <em>Revocation hearing required. </em>Within 10 days after the committed person is returned to the Health Department in accordance with the hospital warrant, the Office shall hold a hearing unless:</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b141-7\">(1) the hearing is postponed or waived by agreement of the parties; or</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b141-8\">(2) the Office postpones the hearing for good cause shown.</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b141-9\">(g) <em>Hearing procedures. </em>At the hearing on revocation or modification: (1) the committed person is entitled to be represented by counsel including, if the committed person is indigent, the Public Defender or designee of the Public Defender;</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b141-10\">(2) the committed person, Health Department, and State\u2019s Attorney are entitled to offer evidence, to cross-examine adverse witnesses, and to exercise any other rights that the Office considers necessary for a fair hearing; and</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b141-11\">(3) the Office shall find:</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b141-12\">(i) whether, by a preponderance of the evidence, the State has proved that the committed person violated conditional release; and</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b141-13\">(ii) whether, by a preponderance of the evidence, the committed person nevertheless has proved eligibility for conditional release.</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b141-14\">(h) <em>Report and exceptions. </em>(1) The Office promptly shall:</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b141-15\">(i) send a report of the hearing and determination to the court; and</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b141-16\">(ii) send copies of the report to the committed person, counsel for the committed person, the State\u2019s Attorney, and the Health Department.</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b142-4\"><page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"110\">*110</page-number>(2)Within 5 days after receipt of the report of the Office, the committed person, the State\u2019s Attorney, or the Health Department may file exceptions to the determination of the Office.</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b142-5\">(i) <em>Court action. </em>After the court considers the report of the Office, the evidence, and any exceptions filed, within 10 days after the court receives the report, the court shall:</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b142-6\">(1) revoke the conditional release and order the committed person returned to the facility designated by the Health Department;</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b142-7\">(2) modify the conditional release as required by the evidence;</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b142-8\">(3) continue the present conditions of release; or</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b142-9\">(4) extend the conditional release by an additional term of 5 years.</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b142-10\">(k) <em>Appeals. </em>(1) An appeal from a District Court order shall be on the record in circuit court.</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b142-11\">(2) An appeal from a circuit court order shall be by application for leave to appeal to the Court of Special Appeals.</blockquote>\n<p id=\"Av-\">The Task Force Comment to HG \u00a7 12-120, predecessor to CP \u00a7 3-121, states that \u201canother major change is that the hearing will be an administrative hearing before a hearing officer of the Department [of Health and Mental Hygiene], with review by the court, rather than a. hearing in court as formerly provided. This change is for the sake of practicality and speeding the implementation of this procedure.\u201d (emphasis added). The Revisor\u2019s Note to CP \u00a7 3-121 further indicates that when it was recodified from HG \u00a7 3-120, aside from certain changes in terminology for accuracy or conformity, the only other changes were stylistic. This indicates a clear legislative intent to have the court perform judicial review of the ALJ\u2019s hearing and determination when a committed person is subject to the procedures of CP \u00a7 3-121. The call for judicial review under CP \u00a7 3-121 is consistent and harmonious with the language of CP \u00a7 3-117 calling for the court to hold a hearing \u201con the record that was made before the Office.\u201d <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"111\">*111</page-number>This further bolsters Judge Moylan\u2019s interpretation that CP \u00a7 3-118 requires the court to perform judicial review after a hearing occurs in OAH.</p>\n<p id=\"b143-5\">We also find it relevant, as did Judge Moylan, that the only place the General Assembly explicitly \u201caffords the possibility of a court procedure\u201d is in CP \u00a7 3 \u2014 119(c) and \u201cnot in combination with but as an alternative to an administrative procedure.\u201d <em>Byers, </em>184 Md.App. at 528, 966 A.2d at 1000. In comparison, the General Assembly utilized language elsewhere in Title 3 indicating that the court performs the task of judicial review. For example, CP \u00a7 3 \u2014 117(b)(1) states that \u201c[t]he court shall hold the hearing on the record that was made before the Office.\u201d Additionally, CP \u00a7 3 \u2014 119(b)(2) states that \u201c[t]he provisions of this title governing administrative hearing and judicial determination of eligibility for release apply to any application for release under this subsection[,]\u201d incorporating by reference the comprehensive administrative procedure set forth in CP \u00a7\u00a7 3-114 through 3-118. This difference also demonstrates the General Assembly\u2019s intent to create an overall statutory scheme that calls for an administrative procedure, unless explicitly stated otherwise. To adopt the action taken by the Circuit Court in this case, or the procedure suggested by the appellees would result in inconsistencies within Title 3.</p>\n<p id=\"b143-6\">The Circuit Court erred in both Merchant\u2019s and Stoddard\u2019s cases when it found the statutory scheme of CP \u00a7\u00a7 3-114 et seq., void as unconstitutional under the separation of powers doctrine. In Merchant\u2019s case, which arose under CP \u00a7 3-121, the Circuit Court erred when it held its own evidentiary hearing. As discussed above, it is clear that the trial judge also erred when he concluded that he was unpersuaded by the psychiatrist\u2019s testimony and unpersuaded that Merchant had met his burden of proof, even though he found there was sufficient evidence on the record to support the ALJ\u2019s recommendation that Merchant be conditionally released again. In Stoddard\u2019s case, Stoddard opted for the administrative procedure under CP \u00a7 3 \u2014 119(b). Therefore, the Circuit Court erred when it held its own hearing on the merits of the case <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"112\">*112</page-number>and declined to consider the ALJ\u2019s report. The court\u2019s actions ran counter to the mandate of CP \u00a7 3-119(a). Furthermore, the Circuit Court\u2019s actions in both cases frustrated the legislative intent to streamline and strengthen the procedures for the release of a person who was found not criminally responsible and \u201ccommitted\u201d in a criminal case.</p>\n<p id=\"b144-4\">IN CASE MISC.
