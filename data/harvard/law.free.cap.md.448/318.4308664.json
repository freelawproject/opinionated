Vol.), which defines \u201cneglect\u201d as \u201cthe intentional failure to provide necessary assistance and resources for the physical needs or mental health of a minor that creates a substantial risk of harm to the minor\u2019s physical health or a substantial risk of mental injury to the minor.\u201d<footnotemark>1</footnotemark> The statute carries a penalty of \u201cimprisonment not exceeding 5 years or a fine not exceeding $5,000 or both.\u201d Maryland Code (2012 Repl. Vol), Section 3-602.1(c) of the Criminal Law Article.</p>\n<p id=\"b352-6\">Beverly Annetta Hall, the Petitioner, had been convicted by a jury in the Circuit Court for Montgomery County of neglect of her minor son and was sentenced to twenty days\u2019 incarceration. Ms. Hall appealed the judgment of the Circuit Court to the Court of Special Appeals, arguing that the definition of <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"321\">*321</page-number>\u201cneglect\u201d contained in Section 3-602.1(a)(5)(i) of the Criminal Law Article was unconstitutionally vague and that the evidence was insufficient to support her conviction. The Court of Special Appeals affirmed the judgment of the Circuit Court, and we granted certiorari to address the following questions:</p>\n<blockquote id=\"b353-5\">1. As an issue of first impression, is Md.Code Ann., Crim. Law \u00a7 3-602.1, the criminal neglect of a minor statute, unconstitutional because it is vague?</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b353-6\">2. Was the evidence sufficient to support conviction for neglect of a minor?</blockquote>\n<p id=\"b353-7\"><em>Hall v. State, </em>444 Md. 638, 120 A.3d 766 (2015). For the reasons that follow, we assume, without having to decide, that the criminal neglect of a minor statute is constitutional but reverse the judgment of the Court of Special of Appeals, because we hold that the evidence was insufficient to support Hall\u2019s conviction for criminal child neglect.</p>\n<p id=\"b353-8\">Early in 2013, Beverly Hall was charged by criminal information in the Circuit Court for Montgomery County with one count of neglect of her minor son A.,<footnotemark>2</footnotemark> in violation of Section 3-602.1 of the Criminal Law Article,<footnotemark>3</footnotemark> ostensibly for having, over a two day period, beginning on February 24 and ending on February 26, 2012, left A. under the supervision of his fourteen-year-old sister, D. Ms. Hall filed a motion to dismiss the charge, arguing, among other things, that Section 3-602.1 was unconstitutionally vague, because the statute- \u201cfail[ed] to in<page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"322\">*322</page-number>form the ordinary person what conduct is prohibited by its enactment[,]\u201d and \u201cfail[ed] to delineate at which point personal parenting choices escalate to neglect, [leading] to arbitrary and discriminatory enforcement.\u201d The motion was denied orally by the circuit court judge who remonstrated that Section 3-602.1 of the Criminal Law Article contained an \u201cawful broad definition of neglect,\u201d but determined that it was not vague:</p>\n<blockquote id=\"b354-5\">I understand the argument, and I understand what the defense is saying here and I guess the bottom line is you may win this argument upstairs. I don\u2019t know, but I\u2019m not going to \u2014 I just don\u2019t find it to be void for vagueness ... I\u2019m not going to find that the statute is void for vagueness. You know, that\u2019s something the Court of Special Appeals is going to have to do.</blockquote>\n<p id=\"b354-6\">The evidence subsequently adduced at trial, taken in the light most favorable to the State,<footnotemark>4</footnotemark> reflected that in the Fall of 2011, Ms. Hall, her fianc\u00e9, and three children \u2014 two daughters, thirteen-year-old D. and ten-year-old M., and a son, three-year-old A. \u2014 were living in a single family home on Lima Drive in Silver Spring, Maryland. Nyree Wannall, a licensed clinical social worker -with Montgomery County Child Welfare, had been providing services to Ms. Hall\u2019s family since May of 2011.<footnotemark>5</footnotemark> Ms. Wannall would perform home visits with Ms. Hall and her family two times monthly, except during the children\u2019s summer vacation when all three visited their maternal grandmother in Florida.</p>\n<p id=\"b355-3\"><page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"323\">*323</page-number>Based on Ms. Wannall\u2019s observations during her home visits, three-year-old A. \u201cran rampant[,]\u201d \u201cwas very, very difficult to control[,]\u201d and was \u201cvery active.\u201d Ms. Wannall described A.\u2019s behavior as: \u201c[y]ou would be there during a home visit, and he would pick up something, and it wouldn\u2019t be surprising if he picked something up and threw it at his sister, or threw it at the TV, and just was always moving.\u201d During one of Ms. Wannall\u2019s home visits in September of 2011, A. threw a bottle at his sister\u2019s face, threw a bottle at the T.V., and bit Ms. Wannall\u2019s foot. He then opened the closed front door of the residence, ran outside, and entered the truck of a postal worker who was in the neighborhood, all during the time his mother was present. D., A.\u2019s sister, retrieved A. from the mail truck, and Ms. Hall did not attempt to control or discipline A. during this episode.</p>\n<p id=\"b355-4\">During Ms. Wannall\u2019s home visits, she would meet with Ms. Hall and the children and would discuss \u201cissues that may have come up with the individuals in the house[.]\u201d A recurring issue raised during Ms. Wannall\u2019s discussions with Hall was that \u201c[D.] needed to spend her time on her studies in school, needed to be a child and not have as many responsibilities in the home[,]\u201d and \u201c[D.] having too many responsibilities with [A.]\u201d By February 15, 2012, Ms. Hall had agreed with Ms. Wannall that \u201c[A.] was too difficult for [D.] to watch[,]\u201d and that she \u201cwould only allow [D.] to watch [M.], her younger sister.\u201d</p>\n<p id=\"b355-5\">During the afternoon of Wednesday, February 22, 2012, D. (now fourteen years of age) and M. had finished the school day and went to A.\u2019s babysitter to pick him up. After bringing A. home, D. was upstairs doing her homework, but came downstairs to find that the front door was open and A. was missing; Ms. Hall was not present at 4:30pm that day, Officer Jim Walsh, responding to a call at a different location, found A. without supervision, wearing only a t-shirt and a diaper, whereupon the Officer went looking for A.\u2019s parents. D. and M. approached Officer Walsh and stated that they \u201cdidn\u2019t know [A.] got out.\u201d Officer Walsh then brought A. back to the house on Lima Drive and retrieved Hall\u2019s phone number from <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"324\">*324</page-number>D. and attempted to call Ms. Hall \u201cat least five\u201d times. He was unable to contact her, and did not recall whether he had left any voicemail messages but left A. under the supervision of D. Ms. Wannall learned of this incident the following day, on February 23, 2012, but did not contact Ms. Hall, as she did not want to interfere with any investigation that might be triggered by Officer Walsh reporting the incident to Child Protective Services.</p>\n<p id=\"b356-5\">According to D., A.\u2019s escape from the home on February 22nd was the third time that she had gone to the playground to retrieve him while he was under her supervision. On a previous occasion, although police had been notified, D. was able to retrieve A. before the police arrived at the playground. The police did follow-up, and came to the house on Lima Drive and instructed D. to have Ms. Hall contact them. D., however, did not inform Ms. Hall of any of these occasions on which A. had escaped to the playground.</p>\n<p id=\"b356-6\">On Friday, the 24th of February, Ms. Hall and her fianc\u00e9 attempted to bring the children to their godmother\u2019s home in Prince George\u2019s County, where the children would spend the weekend. Ms. Hall, however, was unable to locate the godmother and returned home.</p>\n<p id=\"b356-7\">Once home, the children unpacked their belongings, placed some food in the refrigerator, and got ready for bed by taking baths and changing into their \u201cnight clothes.\u201d Ms. Hall did not tell the children where she was going or how long she would be gone, but left an emergency cell phone with D. and told her to call if she needed anything. Ms. Hall also told D. that she would call her \u201cwhen she [got] to her destination, because she [had] to charge her phone.\u201d Ms. Hall and her fianc\u00e9 then left at around 10:00 or 11:00 p.m., and D. locked the door behind them.</p>\n<p id=\"b356-8\">Following Ms. Hall\u2019s departure, the children began watching a movie in the living room. While watching the movie, A., M., and ultimately D., fell asleep. D. then awoke between midnight and 1:00 a.m. to find that A. was no longer on the couch. D. searched the house for A. to no avail and noticed <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"325\">*325</page-number>that the front door to the residence was open. D. attempted to call Hall three to four times, but each of the calls went straight to voicemail. D. also called the fianc\u00e9, whose phone number was programmed in the emergency phone, but no one answered. D. thought she heard someone pick up on one of them but the person on the other line hung up shortly thereafter.</p>\n<p id=\"b357-5\">After failing to reach her mother, D. called the police and searched the neighborhood, while M. stayed at the house. After D. returned without having found A., she made several additional calls to the police. Two police officers, including Officer Rodney Campbell, arrived around 2:30 am and informed D. that they had found A.</p>\n<p id=\"b357-6\">Shortly after 2:00 a.m., Officer Campbell had responded to a call at the intersection of New Hampshire Avenue and Hollywood Avenue (located some 300 to 400 yards from Ms. Hall\u2019s home) and encountered a gentleman pulled over on the side of the road. The man explained to Officer Campbell that he had a baby in his car and that he had almost struck the child, who had been in the middle of the six lane roadway. The child was dressed only in sweatpants and a t-shirt. Officer Campbell, after determining the child\u2019s name was A., contacted other officers and gave out A.\u2019s name and asked whether any of the officers \u201chad dealt with the child before.\u201d Officer Walsh, who had come across A. earlier that week, arrived at the intersection and led Officer Campbell to A.\u2019s home.</p>\n<p id=\"b357-7\">After the officers arrived at A.\u2019s home, they attempted to call both Ms. Hall and her fianc\u00e9, but were unable to reach either of them. The officers then took the children, including A., to the police station where the officers again were unsuccessful in contacting Ms. Hall. As a result, the officers contacted Child Protective Services (\u201cCPS\u201d) and Laura Erstling, the on-call social worker with the Montgomery County Department of Health and Human Services, Child Welfare Service Program, arrived at the police station around 3:30 a.m. Ms. Erstling instructed the officers to leave a note on the door of the home telling Ms. Hall how to reach her and how to get in touch with the children. Ms. Erstling attempted around 4:00 <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"326\">*326</page-number>a.m. to contact Ms. Hall, but was not successful and left a voicemail detailing who she was and how Ms. Hall could reconnect with her children.</p>\n<p id=\"b358-5\">Having had no success contacting Hall, Ms. Erstling drove the children to an emergency foster home at 7:30 a.m. Ms. Hall called Montgomery County Child Protective Services at 10:20 am on the morning of February 25, 2012 \u201cto inquire about the whereabouts of her children.\u201d</p>\n<p id=\"b358-6\">Ms. Hall then was charged with one count of criminal child neglect in the Circuit Court for Montgomery County. After an initial trial in which the jury had failed to reach a unanimous verdict, the State retried Ms. Hall. A second jury did convict Ms. Hall, after which the Judge imposed a sentence of 20 days\u2019 incarceration. Ms. Hall then noted an appeal to the Court of Special Appeals.</p>\n<p id=\"b358-7\">On appeal, Ms. Hall contended that Section 3-602.1 of the Criminal Law Article was void for vagueness and that the evidence was insufficient to support her conviction. The Court of Special Appeals, in an unreported opinion, <em>Beverly Annetta Hall v. State of Maryland, </em>September Term, 2013, No. 2473 (April 21, 2015), affirmed.</p>\n<p id=\"b358-8\">The court determined that the statute was \u201cnot vague as applied to the facts of the instant case\u201d because \u201c[Hall] was fully aware that D[.] was not a proper caregiver for A[.]\u201d:</p>\n<blockquote id=\"Azo\">A reasonably intelligent person would not have to speculate whether leaving a three year-old alone with an improper caregiver for any length of time, much less overnight, and without an effective way to be contacted in case of an emergency, would constitute neglect as defined in the statute. The statute is not vague as applied to the facts of the instant case.</blockquote>\n<p id=\"b358-9\"><em>Id. </em>at 9. The Court of Special Appeals also rejected Hall\u2019s argument that she was inadequately notified of conduct that could violate the statute:</p>\n<blockquote id=\"b358-10\">The risk of harm to such a young child, especially one who is \u201cvery, very difficult to control,\u201d is not limited to the harm that might come from the child exiting the house and wandering outside unsupervised. There are any number of <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"327\">*327</page-number>injuries that could foreseeably result from knowingly leaving an improperly supervised and rambunctious three year-old inside the home as well. [Hall] saw the child throw a dangerous object at people in the home and bite Ms. Wannall on the foot. [A.] also ran out of the house on the day Ms. Wannall was meeting with [Hall] for a home visit. Certainly [Hall] knew or should have known that [A.] could and did leave the house on his own.</blockquote>\n<p id=\"b359-5\"><em>Id. </em>at 10-11.</p>\n<p id=\"b359-6\">Concerning sufficiency of the evidence, the intermediate appellate court observed that an appellate court must \u201c \u2018view[ ] the evidence, and all inferences fairly deducible from the evidence, in a light most favorable to the State.\u2019 \u201d <em>Id. </em>at 18-19, quoting <em>Twine v. State, </em>395 Md. 539, 554, 910 A.2d 1132, 1141 (2006). The Court then remonstrated that Ms. Hall was present on at least one occasion where A. ran out of the house, and Ms. Hall had agreed that D. should not be responsible for A.\u2019s supervision. Furthermore, \u201cdespite this agreement, [Hall] intentionally left [D.] in charge of [A.] for an unspecified amount of time, including overnight hours, and did not answer calls in the middle of the night from [D.], nor did [Hall] answer calls or return messages from the police and CPS.\u201d <em>Id. </em>at 19. In light of the above, the court opined that, \u201cthere was sufficient evidence before the jury for it to find beyond a reasonable doubt that [Hall] neglected [A.] by intentionally leaving him in the care of [D.] in excess of twelve hours, without any effective means to reach her in case of an emergency.\u201d <em>Id. </em>at 20.</p>\n<p id=\"b359-7\">Ms. Hall, before us, initially raises the issue that the \u201cneglect of a minor statute is unconstitutionally vague on its face and as applied to the particular facts of this case[.]\u201d Because we shall hold that there was not sufficient evidence to sustain Ms. Hall\u2019s conviction under Section 3-602.1 of the Criminal Law Article, the criminal child neglect statute, we need not reach the constitutional issue.<footnotemark>6</footnotemark></p>\n<p id=\"b360-3\"><page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"328\">*328</page-number>The criminal neglect statute, Section 3-602.1 of the Criminal Law Article, provides, in relevant part, that \u201c \u2018Neglect\u2019 means the intentional failure to provide necessary assistance and resources for the physical needs or mental health of a minor that creates a substantial risk of harm to the minor\u2019s physical health or a substantial risk of mental injury to the minor.\u201d Maryland Code (2012 Repl. Vol.), Section 3-602.1(a)(l) (5)(i) of the Criminal Law Article.<footnotemark>7</footnotemark> The intentional failure relates to that of \u201c[a] parent, family member, household member, or other person who has permanent or temporary care or custody or responsibility for the supervision of a minor.\u201d</p>\n<p id=\"b360-4\">Although the Court of Special Appeals correctly characterized intent only with reference to whether Ms. Hall failed to provide necessary assistance and resources for the physical health of A., throughout its opinion the court speculated as to the harm that could have befallen A. because of his having been left by Ms. Hall in the care of his fourteen-year-old sister. It is not conjecture about potential harm, however, that governs, but rather whether the conduct at issue, evaluated objectively, created a substantial risk of harm.</p>\n<p id=\"b360-5\">\u201cIntentional failure to provide necessary assistance and resources for the physical needs ... of a minor <em>that </em>creates a substantial risk of harm ...\u201d is the pivotal statutory phrase. \u201c[Cjreates a substantial risk\u201d in Section 3-602.1(a)(5)(i) is the same language used in our reckless endangerment statute, Section 3-204 of the Criminal Law Article, Maryland Code (2012 Repl. Vol), which states, in relevant part:</p>\n<blockquote id=\"b360-6\">(a) A person may not recklessly:</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b360-7\">(1) engage in conduct that <em>creates a substantial risk </em>of death or serious physical injury to another.</blockquote>\n<p id=\"b361-4\"><page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"329\">*329</page-number>The similarity between Section 3-602.1, the criminal child neglect statute, and the reckless endangerment statute, Section 3-204, was noted in testimony in 2011 against the passage of Senate Bill 178, the origin of Section 3-602.1, provided by Melissa S. Rock of Advocates for Children and Youth,<footnotemark>8</footnotemark> who suggested that the proposed child neglect statute was unnecessary because, \u201c[w]e also have a reckless endangerment statute through which a person can be prosecuted for placing another individual at a substantial risk of death or serious physical injury.\u201d The Office of the Public Defender provided similar testimony in opposition to S.B. 178, arguing that the bill \u201c[was] largely duplicative of existing law\u201d by referencing, among other statutes, Section 3-204 of the Criminal Law Article, the reckless endangerment statute, which states that the crime of reckless endangerment is a person acting \u201crecklessly\u201d by \u201cengaging] in conduct that creates a substantial risk of death or serious physical injury to another.\u201d</p>\n<p id=\"b361-5\">We set forth the elements of a <em>prima facie </em>case of reckless endangerment in <em>Jones v. State, </em>357 Md. 408, 427, 745 A.2d 396, 406 (2000), as:</p>\n<blockquote id=\"b361-6\">1) that the defendant engaged in conduct that created a substantial risk of death or serious physical injury to another; 2) that a reasonable person would not have engaged in that conduct; and 3) that the defendant acted recklessly.</blockquote>\n<p id=\"b361-7\">The Maryland Criminal Pattern Jury Instruction on reckless endangerment, Section 4:26A, embodies those same elements.<footnotemark>9</footnotemark> <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"330\">*330</page-number>In <em>Williams v. State, </em>100 Md.App. 468, 481, 641 A.2d 990, 996 (1994), the Court of Special Appeals recognized that the purpose of the reckless endangerment statute is to punish conduct that was potentially harmful, even when no actual harm had occurred. (\u201cAt the <em>actus </em>reus<footnotemark>10</footnotemark> level, [reckless endangerment] is one element short of consummated harm. At the <em>mens rea </em>level, it is one element short of consummated harm. At the <em>mens rea </em>level, it is one element short of the specific intent necessary for either an attempt or for one of the aggravated assaults.\u201d).</p>\n<p id=\"b362-5\">The issue oftentimes plumbed with respect to the <em>actus reus </em>of creating a substantial risk of harm has been whether to measure a defendant\u2019s conduct by a subjective standard or an objective one in order to determine its criminality. Judge Charles Moylan, writing for the Court of Special Appeals in <em>Williams, </em>100 Md.App. at 495, 641 A.2d at 1003, discussed the subjective-objective dichotomy:</p>\n<blockquote id=\"b362-6\">... It is undisputed that the <em>actus reus </em>of creating a substantial risk is to be measured objectively, not subjectively. The <em>mens rea </em>of the defendant, although indispensable to an ultimate finding of guilt, has nothing to do with the establishment of the <em>actus reus. </em>Whether the conduct in issue has, indeed, created a substantial risk of death or serious physical injury is an issue that will be assessed objectively on the basis of the physical evidence in the case.</blockquote>\n<p id=\"Aaq\">Judge Moylan\u2019s words have been relied upon in other Court of Special Appeals opinions considering reckless endangerment. <em>See also Marlin v. State, </em>192 Md.App. 134, 168, 993 A.2d 1141, <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"331\">*331</page-number>1161 (2010); <em>Albrecht v. State, </em>105 Md.App. 45, 85, 658 A.2d 1122, 1141 (1995); <em>Wieland v. State, </em>101 Md.App. 1, 28, 643 A.2d 446, 459 (1994).</p>\n<p id=\"b363-5\">With respect to the evaluation of a defendant\u2019s conduct and the creation of risk, the assessment must be made objectively. The reasonable person standard oftentimes is utilized to measure deviation from the norm, upon which criminal liability is based. <em>Eanes v. State, </em>318 Md. 436, 462, 569 A.2d 604, 616 (1990) (\u201cThe objective \u2018reasonable\u2019 test is used in many areas of the law as an appropriate determinant of liability and thus a guide to conduct.\u201d). Essentially, then, the reasonable person standard in criminal law differentiates between carelessness or negligence and criminal misconduct. <em>See State v. Albrecht, </em>336 Md. 475, 499, 649 A.2d 336, 348 (1994) (citing C.J. Murphy in <em>Mills v. State, </em>13 Md.App. 196, 200, 282 A.2d 147, 149 (1971), <em>cert. denied, </em>264 Md. 750 (1972): \u201c... On the other hand whether an accused\u2019s conduct constituted gross negligence must be determined by the conduct itself and not by the resultant harm. Nor can criminal liability be predicated on every careless act merely because its carelessness results in injury to another.\u201d).</p>\n<p id=\"b363-6\">Utilizing the objective standard to evaluate the <em>actus reus </em>or conduct of a parent in order to determine a violation of the criminal child neglect statute avoids conjecture with regard to the creation of a substantial risk of harm to the child. The standard to be utilized, then, is whether the parent intentionally failed to provide necessary assistance and resources for the physical needs of the child by acting in a manner that created a substantial risk of harm to the child, measured by that which a reasonable person would have done in the circumstances.</p>\n<p id=\"b363-7\">The importance of relying on an objective standard to evaluate parental inaction or neglect lies in the avoidance of \u201c20/20 hindsight\u201d by a jury that can engage in risk distortion. As one commenter on the subject has noted, juries, when faced with evidence of what may have or could have occurred, distort the risk of parental inaction so that all risk becomes <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"332\">*332</page-number>substantial. <em>See </em>David Pimentel, <em>Criminal Child Neglect and the \u201cFree Range Kid\u201d: Is Overprotective Parenting the New Standard of Care?, </em>2012 Utah L. Rev. 947, 988. Professor Pimentel, writing about overprotective parenting, notes that parents, historically, have had little concern for the potential criminality of their parenting decisions, as \u201cthe prevailing concern behind parenting choices has been what is best for the child and for the family.\u201d <em>Id. </em>at 967. The shift toward closer scrutiny of parenting choices \u2014 the result of both societal and legislative emphases on child protection \u2014 has been accompanied by the media sensationalizing the risk to children, according to Professor Pimentel, such that parenting decisions, which necessarily involve parental management of risk to their children, face second-guessing by jurors tasked with determining whether the conduct was, in fact, criminal. <em>Id. </em>at 970-72. Such second-guessing raises the potential that any risk of harm that could be envisioned, aided by 20/20 hindsight, would satisfy criminal culpability in the mind of a jury, according to Professor Pimentel:</p>\n<blockquote id=\"b364-5\">If the risk of harm is literally one in a million \u2014 in the category of \u201cfreak accident\u201d \u2014 it would be patently unreasonable to expect any significant investment in precaution against that harm. And yet, every time that freak accident occurs, the parent may face liability for endangerment, as jurors are likely to take the fact of the harm itself as conclusive evidence of its likelihood[.]</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b364-6\">Psychologists who study fear have determined a number of reasons that people misperceive risks. Indeed, they note that \u201cperceived risks rarely match the actual risks.\u201d</blockquote>\n<p id=\"b364-7\"><em>Id. </em>at 981-83.</p>\n<p id=\"b364-8\">After discussing the psychology of a juror\u2019s assessment of risk and factors that contributed to the distortion between actual and perceived risks,<footnotemark>11</footnotemark> Professor Pimentel concludes <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"333\">*333</page-number>that, \u201cAs already demonstrated, however, juries are ill-equipped to assess, risk, much less to determine when a parent\u2019s poor judgment is sufficiently bad to warrant criminal punishment.\u201d <em>Id. </em>at 987.</p>\n<p id=\"b365-5\">The Supreme Court of Kansas, in a child endangerment case, also recognized the potential for bias and distortion in <em>State v. Cummings, </em>297 Kan. 716, 305 P.3d 556, 565 (2013). In that case, Cummings had provided daycare services for several children in her home and placed one of the children, a thirteen-month old, in a car seat in a bathroom, fastening the child in with the top strap of the car seat but not the bottom strap. <em>Id. </em>at 558. After hearing the child cry for a few minutes and then stop, Cummings assumed the child had gone to sleep, but when she finally did check on the child, he had strangled to death in the car seat. <em>Id. </em>at 559.</p>\n<p id=\"Aty\">The statute under which Cummings was convicted of the crime of involuntary manslaughter during the commission of the crime of endangering a child defined the crime as \u201cintentionally and unreasonably causing or permitting a child under the age of 18 years to be placed in a situation in which the child\u2019s life, body or health <em>may </em>be injured or endangered.\u201d <em>Id. </em>at 561 (emphasis original).</p>\n<p id=\"b365-7\">Cummings had challenged the jury instruction which stated, in part:</p>\n<p id=\"b365-8\">The elements of endangering a child are as follows:</p>\n<blockquote id=\"b365-9\">1. That the defendant intentionally and unreasonably caused or permitted [the child] to be placed in a situation in <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"334\">*334</page-number>which there was a reasonable probability that [the child]\u2019s life, body or health would be injured or endangered;</blockquote>\n<p id=\"b366-5\"><em>Id. </em>at 560-61, arguing the jury should have been told that \u201creasonable probability\u201d was more than a faint or remote possibility and that the likelihood of harm will result or the child is placed in imminent peril. <em>Id. </em>at 561. The Supreme Court of Kansas emphasized the effect of \u201chindsight bias and risk distortion,\u201d reversed Cummings\u2019s conviction and held that the term \u201creasonable probability\u201d was ambiguous:</p>\n<blockquote id=\"b366-6\">The problem associated with this ambiguity is real; a defendant could be convicted based on <em>the </em>jury\u2019s misunderstanding of the level of culpability that our endangering a child statute requires. The severity of this problem increases because of hindsight bias and risk distortion.</blockquote>\n<p id=\"Aj1o\"><em>id. </em>at 565.</p>\n<p id=\"b366-7\">Similarly, the Ohio intermediate appellate court, in <em>State v. McLeod, </em>165 Ohio App.3d 434, 846 N.E.2d 915 (2006), reversed a conviction for child endangerment based on insufficient evidence. Ohio\u2019s child endangerment statute \u201cprovide[d] that no person ... \u2018shall create a substantial risk to the health or safety of the child, by violating a duty of care, protection, or support.\u2019 \u201d <em>Id. </em>at 917. The term \u201csubstantial risk\u201d was also defined by statute as, \u201ca strong possibility, as contrasted with a remote or significant possibility, that a certain result may occur or that certain circumstances may exist.\u201d <em>Id.</em></p>\n<p id=\"b366-8\">In the case, McLeod had agreed to watch the five year-old daughter of a friend, along with two younger children of another friend; he took a walk around the apartment complex with the younger children after checking on the girl at the playground. Someone reported the girl as unattended, and a deputy sheriff found the child. McLeod was charged and convicted of child endangerment.</p>\n<p id=\"b366-9\">The Ohio appellate court reversed and noted that \u201cparents or other child caregivers are not criminally liable for every error in judgment[.]\u201d <em>Id. </em>at 917. Noting that other parents allowed their children to play unsupervised at the playground, the court concluded that checking on a child who was playing <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"335\">*335</page-number>with other children in a playground every thirty minutes did not rise to the level of reckless endangerment and stated:</p>\n<blockquote id=\"AKl\">The failure to realize an ideal level of supervisory attention of a child does not equate to acting with heedless indifference to the consequences, thereby perversely disregarding a known strong possibility, as contrasted with a remote or significant possibility, of harm to the health or safety of the child.</blockquote>\n<p id=\"b367-5\"><em>Id. </em>at 918.</p>\n<p id=\"b367-6\">In <em>State v. Anderson, </em>108 S.W.3d 680 (Mo.Ct.App.2002), a mother was convicted of second-degree child endangerment after her seven-year-old child, who was disabled, was found naked on a highway. The Missouri child endangerment statute provided that \u201c[a] person commits the crime of endangering the welfare of a child in the second degree if ... [s]he with criminal negligence acts in a manner that creates a substantial risk to the life, body or health of a child less than seventeen years old.\u201d <em>Id. </em>at 682. The State was required to prove that the mother acted with \u201ccriminal negligence\u201d that \u201ccreate[d] a substantial risk to life, body, or health of a child[.]\u201d <em>Id.</em></p>\n<p id=\"b367-7\">The Missouri Court of Appeals reversed the mother\u2019s conviction and opined that, \u201c[while] the failure to properly supervise a child may constitute child endangerment under certain circumstances[,] ... in such cases the failure to act must pose an actual or practically certain risk or danger and not just the potential for risk or danger.\u201d <em>Id. </em>at 683 (internal quotation omitted). The court noted that no evidence had been presented to establish that Anderson failed to supervise her son and that this failure resulted in the child\u2019s ending up in the middle of the highway. <em>Id. </em>Thus, the court concluded:</p>\n<blockquote id=\"b367-8\">Any finding that Anderson\u2019s failure to supervise J.A. posed a substantial and unjustifiable risk of danger to J.A. could not have been based upon anything more than mere speculation and conjecture.</blockquote>\n<p id=\"b367-9\"><em>Id. </em>Reversing Anderson\u2019s conviction, the appellate court stated, \u201cthe evidence presented at trial simply does not establish that any failure by Anderson to supervise J.A. posed a sub<page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"336\">*336</page-number>stantial risk that J.A. would end up standing in the middle of the highway or that Anderson should have been aware of such a risk.\u201d <em>Id. </em>at 684.</p>\n<p id=\"b368-5\">In the present case, conviction for criminal child neglect requires that Ms. Hall\u2019s conduct \u2014 leaving her three-year-old son, A., in the care of his fourteen year-old sister\u2014 created a \u201csubstantial risk of harm\u201d to A.\u2019s physical health and that her conduct was such that a reasonable parent under the circumstances would not have engaged in. The evidence, however, taken in the light most favorable to the State was insufficient to satisfy the standard.</p>\n<p id=\"b368-6\">Ms. Hall left her three year-old son, A., a child who was, admittedly, difficult to handle, in the overnight care of his fourteen year-old sister, D., after ensuring that he had been fed and was ready to go to bed. After Ms. Hall and her fianc\u00e9 departed, the door to the house was locked and the children, including A. and D., fell asleep. The fact that A. was in the care of a fourteen year-old was objectively reasonable taking into consideration that statutorily a thirteen year-old is deemed an appropriate caretaker for a child under eight years of age:</p>\n<blockquote id=\"b368-7\">A person who is charged with the care of a child under the age of 8 years may not allow the child to be locked or confined in a dwelling, building, enclosure, or motor vehicle while the person charged is absent and the dwelling, building, enclosure, or motor vehicle is out of the sight of the person charged unless the person charged provides a reliable person at least 13 years old to remain with the child to protect the child.</blockquote>\n<p id=\"b368-8\">Maryland Code (1984, 2012 Repl. Vol.), Section 5-801 (a) of the Family Law Article. Although Ms. Hall had agreed with Ms. Wannall not to leave A. under the supervision of D., a fact upon which the Court of Special Appeals relied in its analysis, accord did not convert her agreement to the level of one which had criminal consequences. The main thrust of Ms. Wannall\u2019s concern regarding D. and her supervision of A. was D.\u2019s need to \u201cspend more time on her studies\u201d and \u201cnot have as many <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"337\">*337</page-number>responsibilities in the home.\u201d Certainly, also, the agreement between Ms. Hall and Ms. Wannall could not have been the basis of a criminal conspiracy. As a result, although it is beyond dispute that Ms. Hall was negligent in not responding to telephone calls from D. and the authorities, she was not guilty of criminal child neglect.</p>\n<p id=\"b369-5\">JUDGMENT OF THE COURT OF SPECIAL APPEALS REVERSED.

I write separately to elaborate on what I understand the Majority Opinion to mean in two respects.</p>\n<p id=\"b369-10\">\n<em>Determination as to Vagueness</em>\n</p>\n<p id=\"b369-11\">The Majority Opinion holds that the evidence was insufficient to support Ms. Hall\u2019s conviction for criminal child neglect, but it explicitly avoids addressing whether the statute prohibiting criminal neglect of a minor is unconstitutionally vague. Majority op. at 320, 139 A.3d at 937. In my view, the former holding necessarily entails a decision that the statute is not unconstitutionally vague. For the Court to hold that the evidence is insufficient to support a guilty verdict, the Court must conclude that no rational trier of fact could have found the essential elements of the crime beyond a reasonable doubt. <em>Moye v. State, </em>369 Md. 2, 12, 796 A.2d 821 (2002). A statute is unconstitutionally vague if it would not afford a person \u201cof ordinary intelligence and experience ... a reasonable opportunity to know what is prohibited.... \u201d <em>Galloway v. State, </em>365 <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"338\">*338</page-number>Md. 599, 615, 781 A.2d 851 (2001). If the statute were unconstitutionally vague, then a trier of fact would not know what the essential elements of the crime were and we could not reach a conclusion, one way or the other, whether the trier of fact could have found that the elements of the offense were proven.</p>\n<p id=\"b370-5\">Thus, in order to conclude, as the Majority opinion does, that no rational trier of fact could have found the essential elements of the crime from the evidence here, we necessarily must be able to identify the elements of the offense and have surmounted the vagueness hurdle. For the reasons that Judge Hotten\u2019s dissent ably explains, I do not believe that the statute is unconstitutionally vague. However, for the reasons that the Majority Opinion elucidates, I do not believe the evidence was sufficient to support the conviction.</p>\n<p id=\"b370-6\">\n<em>A Before-the-Fact Standard</em>\n</p>\n<p id=\"b370-7\">Additionally, I understand the Majority Opinion to apply a before-the-fact standard, rather than an after-the-fact standard. According to the statute, we must examine whether Ms. Hall\u2019s actions created a \u201csubstantial risk\u201d of harm to A. <em>See </em>Maryland Code, Criminal Law Article, \u00a7 3-602.1. We must guard against considering the risk of a harm to be substantial merely because we know, after the fact, that some harm materialized. The proper inquiry is whether the risk should be considered substantial at the time that the parent or other caretaker acted. One who creates a very small risk of harm to a child is not criminally negligent simply because an unforeseeable tragedy follows. On the other hand, a parent or caretaker may be criminally negligent when that individual creates a substantial risk of harm, whether or not the harm actually befalls the child. In this case, this standard means that we consider what Ms. Hall could be reasonably expected to foresee as possible outcomes of leaving A. at home with D. Whether A. in fact ran out of the house afterward or stayed on the couch sleeping all night is not relevant; what matters is whether Ms. Hall\u2019s actions created a substantial risk, not what <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"339\">*339</page-number>harm actually ensued. I understand the Majority Opinion\u2019s analysis to apply this standard, so I concur.</p>\n<judges id=\"b371-5\">Chief Judge BARBERA has indicated that she joins this opinion.</judges>\n</opinion>\n<opinion data-order=\"12\" data-type=\"opinion\" id=\"x999-4\" type=\"dissent\">\n<author id=\"b371-6\">HOTTEN, J.,</author>\n<p id=\"A7R\">dissenting, in which GREENE and WATTS, JJ., join.</p>\n<p id=\"b371-7\">I respectfully dissent from the majority opinion. I would hold that the evidence at trial, when viewed in a light most favorable to the State, was sufficient to satisfy \u00a7 3-602.1 of the Criminal Law Article (\u201cCrim. Law\u201d), which was not unconstitutionally vague as applied to Ms. Hall (\u201cPetitioner\u201d).</p>\n<p id=\"b371-8\">I. The Evidence at Trial was Sufficient to Sustain Petitioner\u2019s Conviction.</p>\n<p id=\"b371-9\">Crim. Law \u00a7 3-602.1 required that Petitioner\u2019s conduct \u201ccreated a \u2018substantial risk of harm\u2019 to A.\u2019s physical health and that her conduct was such that a reasonable parent under the circumstances would not have engaged in.\u201d Maj. Op. at 336, 139 A.3d at 946. Here, notwithstanding the statutory acknowledgement that \u201ca thirteen year-old is ... an appropriate caretaker for a child under eight years of age[,]\u201d Maj. Op. at 336, 139 A.3d at 946, the direct and circumstantial evidence before the court was sufficient to establish that Petitioner knew D. was an inappropriate caretaker for A. <em>Allen v. State, </em>402 Md. 59, 76-77, 935 A.2d 421, 431 (2007) (\u201c[W]e review a challenge to the sufficiency of the evidence in a jury trial by determining whether the evidence, viewed in a light most favorable to the prosecution, supported the conviction ..., such that any rational trier of fact could have found the essential elements of the crime beyond a reasonable doubt.\u201d). Thus, Petitioner\u2019s decision to leave A. with D. overnight, when she was unreachable until late the following morning, was not \u201cobjectively reasonable\u201d as proffered by the majority. Maj. Op. at 335, 139 A.3d at 945.</p>\n<p id=\"b371-10\">D.\u2019s testimony revealed that A. had a propensity to escape from home unattended, and, the social worker, Ms. Wannall established that Petitioner was present for at least one such <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"340\">*340</page-number>incident where A. had escaped from the home and entered the truck of a nearby postal worker. Ms. Wannall further described a typical episode of A\u2019s rambunctious behavior in Petitioner\u2019s presence, and opined that A. \u201cran rampant[,]\u201d \u201cwas very, very difficult to control[,]\u201d and was \u201cvery active.\u201d Regarding direct evidence of Petitioner\u2019s knowledge, Ms. Wannall testified that a recurring theme during her conversations with Petitioner was the appropriateness of D. caring for A. Notably, Ms. Wannall raised this issue with Petitioner just nine days prior to the night in question, and Petitioner had agreed that \u201c[A.] was too difficult for [D.] to watch[,]\u201d and that she would no longer leave A. under the supervision of D.</p>\n<p id=\"b372-4\">The majority proffers that the Court of Specials Appeals\u2019 reliance on this agreement was misplaced because \u201c[t]he main thrust of Ms. Wannall\u2019s concern regarding D. and her supervision of A. was D.\u2019s need to \u2018spend more time on her studies\u2019 and \u2018not have as many responsibilities in the home.\u2019 \u201d Maj. Op. at 336, 139 A.3d at 946. Although the majority\u2019s interpretation of Ms. Wannall\u2019s concern is certainly reasonable, nothing in the record indicates that Ms. Wannall\u2019s concerns were limited to the amount of responsibility placed on D. Thus, where this Court is required to \u201creview the evidence and all inferences in a light most favorable to the State[,]\u201d Ms. Wannall\u2019s concern should be viewed as pertaining to the wellbeing of both A. and D. <em>Allen, </em>402 Md. at 77, 935 A.2d at 431. Petitioner\u2019s agreement with Ms. Wannall was, therefore, probative of Petitioner\u2019s knowledge that D. was incapable of providing adequate care for A.</p>\n<p id=\"b372-5\">Notwithstanding Petitioner\u2019s knowledge that D. was ill-suited to supervise A., Petitioner advised her children that she \u201cwould be right back[,]\u201d and then left A. under D.\u2019s supervision on the night of February 24, 2012. Petitioner did not tell her children where she could be found, did not tell them when she would be back, and made no efforts to reconnect with her children until after 10am the following morning. Furthermore, despite giving D. a cell phone to use in the event of an emergency,<footnotemark>1</footnotemark> Petitioner was entirely unavailable, as her cell <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"341\">*341</page-number>phone went straight to voicemail during the numerous unsuccessful attempts by D., law enforcement, and the social worker to contact her after A. was found unattended in the middle of a six lane roadway.</p>\n<p id=\"b373-5\">The factfinder could have reasonably concluded \u201cthat [Petitioner\u2019s] conduct ... created a \u2018substantial risk of harm\u2019 to A.\u2019s physical health and that her conduct was such that a reasonable parent under the circumstances would not have engaged in.\u201d Maj. Op. at 336, 139 A.3d at 946.

Proc.\u201d) Article, provides additional notice of what is encompassed by the term \u201cneglect\u201d in the case at bar.</p>\n<p id=\"b379-4\">Similar to the child neglect statute, Crim. Law \u00a7 3-604(a)(7)(i) defines \u201cneglect\u201d of a vulnerable adult as the: intentional failure to provide necessary assistance and resources for the physical needs of a vulnerable adult, including:</p>\n<blockquote id=\"b379-5\">1. food;</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b379-6\">2. clothing;</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b379-7\">3. toileting;</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b379-8\">4. essential medical treatment;</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b379-9\">5. shelter; or</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b379-10\">6. supervision.</blockquote>\n<p id=\"b379-11\">Although Crim. Law \u00a7 3-602.1 contains no specific examples of what is included amongst the \u201cphysical needs of a minor,\u201d the specific examples of \u201cthe physical needs of a vulnerable adult\u201d confirm the types of essentials that are encompassed by the common understanding of \u201cphysical needs.\u201d According to Petitioner, the General Assembly\u2019s decision to define what is necessary for the physical needs and resources of a vulnerable adult also indicates that the term \u201cnecessary assistance and resources for the physical needs\u201d is a vague term. However, several out-of-state courts, in addressing vagueness challenges, have looked to definitions provided in related statutes to determine whether there is notice of a term\u2019s meaning in the law at issue. <em>See State v. Hagan, </em>387 So.2d 943, 945 (Fla.1980) (\u201cIn the absence of a statutory definition, resort may be had to case law or related statutory provisions which define the term, and where a statute does not specifically define words of common usage, such words are construed in their plain and ordinary sense.\u201d); <em>Com. v.

Kassover, </em>24 Misc.2d 1080, 205 N.Y.S.2d 428, 481 (N.Y.Sp.Sess.1960) (\u201cThe fact that language in a statute or regulation may require reference to \u2018definitions\u2019 in that or in a related statute, does not necessarily render such statute or regulation vague or indefinite.\u201d); <em>State v. Winslow, </em>134 N.H. 398, 400, 593 A.2d 238 (1991) (\u201c[T]he necessary specificity, however, need not be contained in the statute itself, but rather, the statute in question may be read in the context of related statutes, prior decisions, or generally accepted usage.\u201d).</p>\n<p id=\"b380-5\">There is also good reason for the General Assembly to paint with a broader brush when drafting the child abuse statute. A \u201cvulnerable adult\u201d is defined in terms of a condition \u2014 \u201can adult who lacks the physical or mental capacity to provide for the adult\u2019s daily needs[,]\u201d Crim. Law \u00a7 3-604(a)(10) \u2014 so there is likely a somewhat finite understanding of what is required for the physical needs of such a person. To the contrary, a minor (anyone under the age of 18) is defined by reference to age, and there are minors within this range that require drastically different levels/types of assistance to meet their physical needs. Therefore, the term \u201cnecessary assistance and resources for the physical needs\u201d is susceptible to a definition with concrete examples in Crim. Law \u00a7 3-604, but not in Crim. Law \u00a7 3-602.1.</p>\n<p id=\"b380-6\">The amendments made to S.B. 178 (Md. 2011), which ultimately created Crim. Law \u00a7 3-602.1, reveal that the General Assembly recognized the difficulty involved in drafting legislation comprehensive enough to encompass all that is necessary for the physical needs of a minor, as compared to a vulnerable adult. As S.B. 178 was originally introduced in the Senate, \u201cneglect\u201d was defined in the exact same manner as the vulnerable adult statute: \u201cthe intentional failure to provide necessary assistance and resources for the physical needs of a minor, including:\u201d</p>\n<blockquote id=\"b380-7\">(I) Food</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b381-4\"><page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"349\">*349</page-number>(II) Clothing</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b381-5\">(III) Toileting</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b381-6\">(IV) Essential Medical treatment</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b381-7\">(V) Shelter; or</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b381-8\">(VI) Supervision</blockquote>\n<p id=\"b381-9\">S.B. 178 (as introduced and first read in the Senate, January-24, 2011) (capitalization omitted). However, S.B. 178 was subsequently approved with amendments by the Senate Judicial Proceedings Committee, which deleted the \u201claundry list (food, clothing, toileting, essential medical treatment, shelter or, or supervision^,]\u201d and instead \u201crequire[d] that the failure to provide creates a substantial risk of harm to the minor\u2019s physical or mental health[.]\u201d SENATE JUDICIAL PROCEEDINGS COMMITTEE: FLOOR REPORT, S.B. 178 at 1 (Md. 2011). This comprehensive definition of \u201cneglect\u201d in S.B. 178 was ultimately signed into law, and the decision to deviate from the definition of \u201cneglect\u201d in the vulnerable adult statute evidences the General Assembly\u2019s intent to encompass a range of conduct that was not limited by the \u201claundry list\u201d used in the vulnerable adult statute. <em>See Williams, </em>329 Md. at 13, 616 A.2d at 1280-81 (noting that \u201call broad laws attempting to punish a range of criminal conduct\u201d are not \u201csusceptible to vagueness challenges insofar as they could be drawn more narrowly and precisely.\u201d).</p>\n<p id=\"b381-10\">In addition to the vulnerable adult statute, \u201cneglect\u201d is also defined in a similar fashion in the Maryland Child In Need of Assistance (\u201cCINA\u201d) statute. Cts. &amp; Jud. Proc. \u00a7 3-801(s). Petitioner contends that the body of law addressing \u201cneglect\u201d in CINA cases is of limited relevance because Crim. Law \u00a7 3-602.1 is a criminal statute designed to punish caregivers, whereas a CINA proceeding is a civil proceeding that serves to protect minors. Petitioner also notes that the language of the statutes are different. It is true that a criminal proceeding serves an interest not necessarily served by a CINA proceeding because \u201cthe legislative intention underlying a CINA proceeding is not to punish the parent[.]\u201d <em>In re Blessen H., </em>392 Md. 684, 707-09, 898 A.2d 980, 994 (2006) <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"350\">*350</page-number>(quoting <em>In re John P. and Thomas P., </em>311 Md. 700-709, 537 A.2d 263, 268 (1988)). Furthermore, while the void-for-vagueness doctrine applies to both criminal and civil statutes, the Supreme Court has noted that the U.S. Constitution is more tolerant of vagueness in civil enactments than criminal enactments. <em>Vill. of Hoffman Estates v. Flipside, Hoffman Estates, Inc., </em>455 U.S. 489, 498-99, 102 S.Ct. 1186, 1193, 71 L.Ed.2d 362 (1982) (\u201cThe Court has also expressed greater tolerance of enactments with civil rather than criminal penalties because the consequences of imprecision are qualitatively less severe.\u201d) (footnote omitted).</p>\n<p id=\"b382-5\">Notwithstanding these differences, a determination that a child is a CINA and a finding of guilt under Crim. Law \u00a7 3-602.1 both serve the legitimate State interest of protecting Maryland children. Additionally, although the results of the two proceedings will be different, each constitutes an interference with the fundamental constitutional right of a parent to raise their child how they see fit. <em>In Re Yve S., </em>373 Md. 551, 565, 819 A.2d 1030, 1038-39 (2003) (discussing the fundamental rights of a parent in relation to their child). Thus, notice of the conduct sufficient to constitute neglect under the CINA statute is certainly relevant in providing notice of the conduct comprising criminal neglect, as the statutes are related in both purpose and result.</p>\n<p id=\"b382-6\">CINA refers to \u201ca child who requires court intervention because: (1) [t]he child has been abused, has been neglected, has a developmental disability, or has a mental disorder; and (2) [t]he child\u2019s parents, guardian, or custodian are unable or unwilling to give proper care and attention to the child and the child\u2019s needs.\u201d Cts. &amp; Jud.

These cases provide additional notice of the point at which the State will interfere with ordinarily protected parenting decisions, thereby reinforcing the conclusion that Crim.

Mahurin, </em>799 S.W.2d 840, 842 (Mo.1990) (holding that Missouri\u2019s child endangerment statute provided notice of the prohibited act, and reasoning that \u201c[t]he words \u2018substantial risk\u2019 have a plain and ordinary meaning cognizable by a person of ordinary intelligence.\u201d); <em>see, e.g., </em>Crim. Law \u00a7 3-204(a)(l) (reckless endangerment); Crim. Law \u00a7 3-202 (assault in the first degree) Crim. Law \u00a7 3-1001(c) (threats to commit crimes of violence); Crim. Law \u00a7 3-201(d) (defining \u201cserious physical injury\u201d and \u201cphysical injury that ... creates a substantial risk of death[.]\u201d). Whether a substantial risk has been created involves \u201can <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"353\">*353</page-number>objective assessment of the degree of risk\u201d created by the failure to provide necessary assistance and resources to the minor. <em>Cf. Minor v. State, </em>326 Md. 436, 442, 605 A.2d 138, 141 (1992) (Noting that, whether the defendant has created the \u201csubstantial risk of death or serious physical injury\u201d required under the reckless endangerment statute, \u201centails an objective assessment of the degree of risk presented by the defendant\u2019s reckless conduct.\u201d).</p>\n<p id=\"b385-5\">Regarding this objective assessment, the majority appropriately borrows from the reckless endangerment statute, Crim. Law \u00a7 3-204(a)(l), to note that the creation of a substantial risk of harm \u201cis measured by that which a reasonable person would have done in the circumstances.\u201d Maj. Op. at 329-32, 139 A.3d at 942-44 (discussing <em>Jones v. State, </em>357 Md. 408, 427, 745 A.2d 396, 406 (2000), and <em>Williams v. State, </em>100 Md.App. 468, 481, 641 A.2d 990, 996 (1994)). This construction of Crim. Law \u00a7 3-602.1 \u2014 imposing a measure of objective reasonableness on the <em>actus reus </em>of \u201ccreation of a substantial risk\u201d \u2014 allows a member of society to choose between lawful and unlawful conduct by adherence to a familiar standard of conduct. This standard also provides a safeguard against the use of hindsight to prosecute caregivers in scenarios where a minimum risk of harm materializes, notwithstanding the reasonableness of the caregiver\u2019s actions.</p>\n<p id=\"b385-6\">In light of the above, I would hold that the standard of conduct prescribed by Crim. Law \u00a7 3-602.1 could be fairly understood by Petitioner. As discussed in further detail in Section I, <em>swpra, </em>Petitioner was fully aware that A. was a difficult child, and conceded that it was inappropriate for D. to supervise A. Petitioner would therefore have been placed on notice that leaving A. with D. overnight, without any way for D. to contact Petitioner, would likely deprive A. of the necessities for his physical well-being, and that doing so was not \u201cobjectively reasonable[.]\u201d Maj. Op. at 335, 139 A.3d at 945.</p>\n<p id=\"b385-7\">I would further hold that Crim. Law \u00a7 3-602.1 provided a fixed standard that, from the perspective of law enforcement, was clearly applicable to Petitioner\u2019s conduct. According to <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"354\">*354</page-number>Petitioner, the fact that Officer Walsh, after finding A. at the playground without supervision on February 22, 2012, returned A. home with only D. and M. present, \u201cillustrates the lack of guidance the statute provides to law enforcement.\u201d</p>\n<p id=\"b386-5\">To the contrary, I believe law enforcement\u2019s actions were reflective of the scienter requirement in the child neglect statute. As discussed in detail above, Crim. Law \u00a7 3-602.1 required that Petitioner should have foreseen that her conduct would likely result in the \u201cfailure to provide necessary assistance and resources for the physical needs ... of a minor[.]\u201d Crim. Law \u00a7 3 \u2014 602.1(a)(5)(i). In light of this <em>mens rea </em>requirement, it is highly likely that law enforcement personnel, in this case Officer Walsh, would not know that a crime had been committed until more circumstances regarding an individual case were ascertained. This is because a child may be found in a situation where, despite the absence of criminal neglect, there was a substantial risk to the child\u2019s physical health. Therefore, it is entirely reasonable that Officer Walsh, when discovering A. at the park, would not know that a crime has been committed until he became aware of the circumstances that reflected a lack of child supervision. Accordingly, there was no reason to believe that a law enforcement officer who returned A. to D.\u2019s supervision, and waited to consult with social workers before pursuing charges under Crim. Law \u00a7 3-602.1, was left without \u201cadequate guidelines\u201d for enforcement of the statute. Officer Walsh\u2019s actions simply reflect that Crim. Law \u00a7 3-602.1 insulates innocent parenting mistakes from criminal liability.</p>\n<p id=\"b386-6\">In summation, I would hold that Crim. Law \u00a7 3-602.1 was not unconstitutionally vague as applied to Petitioner, and that the evidence was sufficient to sustain Petitioner\u2019s conviction.</p>\n<judges id=\"b386-7\">GREENE and WATTS, JJ., authorized me to state they join in this opinion.</judges>\n<footnote label=\"1\">\n<p id=\"b372-6\">.
