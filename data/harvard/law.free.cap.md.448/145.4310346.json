At 10:55 p.m. on February 18, 2015, Officer Norizn<footnotemark>6</footnotemark> saw that Seenath was driving a 2004 Ford <em>pickup </em>\u2014 ie., a non-commercial motor vehicle\u2014 south on Maryland Route 355 near the intersection with Redland Boulevard. Seenath was stopped for changing lanes in an unsafe manner while the Ford pickup was close to another vehicle. At least one of the officers noticed that Seenath had bloodshot eyes and a strong odor of alcohol. One of the officers administered the three-part Standardized Field Sobriety Test.<footnotemark>7</footnotemark></p>\n<p id=\"b184-4\"><page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"152\">*152</page-number>Although the Officer\u2019s Certification and Order of Suspension does not make clear the results of the three-part Standardized Field Sobriety Test,<footnotemark>8</footnotemark> an administrative law judge found that the evidence of Seenath\u2019s intoxication included his \u201cpoor performance on\u201d the three-part Standardized Field Sobriety Test. According to the Officer\u2019s Certification and Order of Suspension, Seenath took a preliminary breath test, which indicated an alcohol concentration of 0.161.</p>\n<p id=\"b184-5\">Officer Romack arrested Seenath and provided him with an Advice of Rights form. The Advice of Rights form, which was labeled \u201cDR-15,\u201d had been produced in November 2012, and stated in pertinent part:</p>\n<blockquote id=\"b184-6\">You have been stopped or detained[,] and reasonable grounds exist to believe that you have been driving or attempting to drive a motor vehicle under circumstances requiring that you be asked to submit to a test under [TR] \u00a7 16 \u2014 205[.]1[ ].

(Officer check reply)</blockquote>\n<p id=\"b188-4\">(Emphasis in original). At 11:37 p.m. on February 18, 2015, Seenath consented to take an alcohol concentration test; the box next to the words \u201cYes \u2014 Agree to submit to an alcohol concentration test\u201d on the Advice of Rights form was checked; and Seenath signed the form.</p>\n<p id=\"b188-5\">According to a \u201cNotification to Defendant of Result of Test for Alcohol Concentration\u201d (some capitalization omitted), at 11:47 p.m. on February 18, 2015, a specimen of Seenath\u2019s breath was collected; an alcohol concentration test of Seenath\u2019s breath indicated an alcohol concentration of 0.15. According to the Officer\u2019s Certification and Order of Suspension, Officer Romack confiscated Seenath\u2019s commercial driver\u2019s license and issued Seenath a temporary driver\u2019s license, which would be valid for 45 days; starting on the forty-sixth day, Seenath\u2019s commercial driver\u2019s license would be suspended for 90 days.</p>\n<p id=\"b188-6\">Proceedings Before the Administrative Law Judge</p>\n<p id=\"b188-7\">Seenath requested an administrative hearing. On May 27, 2015, an administrative law judge (\u201cthe ALJ\u201d) of the Office of Administrative Hearings conducted a hearing, at which Seenath was represented by counsel. Without objection, the ALJ admitted into evidence, among other things, the Officer\u2019s Certification and Order of Suspension, the Advice of Rights form, and the Notification to Defendant of Result of Test for Alcohol Concentration.</p>\n<p id=\"b188-8\">Through counsel, Seenath moved that no action be taken with respect to the suspension of his commercial driver\u2019s license on the ground that the Officer\u2019s Certification and Order of Suspension did not state reasonable grounds for requesting an alcohol concentration test. Specifically, Seenath\u2019s counsel stated that the handwritten notations under <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"157\">*157</page-number>\u201cREASONABLE GROUNDS\u201d were \u201cimpossible to interpret\u00e9\u201d <footnotemark>9</footnotemark> The ALJ denied the motion on the ground that the strong odor of alcohol on Seenath was sufficient to establish reasonable grounds for requesting an alcohol concentration test.</p>\n<p id=\"b189-4\">Seenath testified at the administrative hearing that he had participated in alcohol counseling; that he owned his own business, SS Trucking, of which four dump trucks were a part; and that he drove a dump truck five to six days per week. Seenath did not testify about any matter with regard to his signing or understanding of the Advice of Rights form.</p>\n<p id=\"b189-5\">After testifying, Seenath, through counsel, again moved for no action with respect to the suspension of his commercial driver\u2019s license, this time on the ground that the Advice of Rights form \u201cdid not fully advise him of all the potential consequences.\u201d Specifically, Seenath\u2019s counsel argued that the Advice of Rights form did not advise that, if a commercial driver\u2019s license holder\u2019s license is suspended, the driver cannot have access to a commercial driver\u2019s license through a restrictive license or participation in the Ignition Interlock System Program. Seenath\u2019s counsel stated:</p>\n<blockquote id=\"b189-6\">[T]his form is particularly deceptive to someone who is in [Seenath]\u2019s position becausef,] with regard to a [commercial driver\u2019s license], the only thing that it alleges is, look, if you refuse, you\u2019re going to lose your [commercial driver\u2019s license] for a year. And[,] by asserting that and not mentioning the other aspect[ \u2014 ]that[,] if you get any modification, you\u2019re also going to lose your [commercial driver\u2019s license\u2014 i]t creates the impression that the only way [that] you\u2019re going to lose your [commercial driver\u2019s license] is if you refuse. So [Seenath] then goes ahead and he takes the test with a form that leads someone to believe [that] you\u2019ll be okay, you\u2019ll get to keep your [commercial driver\u2019s license], you can even put an [ignition interlock [system] in a dump truck if you need to and keep on driving, you might get a <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"158\">*158</page-number>restrictive] license and keep on driving. So[,] when [Seenath] comes into my office, I have to tell him that, no, this form is incorrect as it applies to you. You are subject to a different aspect of the law, [Code of Maryland Regulations (\u201cCOMAR\u201d) 11.11.12.07,] which is not mentioned in this [Advice of Rights] form.</blockquote>\n<p id=\"b190-5\">(Paragraph break omitted). COMAR 11.11.12.07A states: \u201cThe [MVA] may not issue any type of temporary, conditional, or work[-]restricted license permitting an individual to drive a commercial motor vehicle during any period in which the individual\u2019s driving privilege is disqualified, refused, cancelled, suspended, or revoked in this or any other state in accordance with [TR] \u00a7[ ]16 \u2014 808 [ (Persons Ineligible to Drive Commercial Motor Vehicles) ] and 49 [Code of Federal Regulations (\u201cCFR\u201d) ] \u00a7[ ]384.210 [ (Limitation on Licensing) ].\u201d</p>\n<p id=\"b190-6\">The ALJ ruled as follows:</p>\n<blockquote id=\"b190-7\">I\u2019m going to respond to your [m]otion, first with a common! ]sense response, and then cite case law. The common! ]sense response is, if a driver is driving with alcohol in his or her system and the amount of the alcohol is [0].15 or greater, if the driver would submit to the [alcohol concentration] test, then a [0].15 or greater ... would result in the possibility of a 90-day suspension!,] or[,] in the alternative, the Ignition Interlock [System Program]. If the driver has a [commercial [d]river\u2019s [l]icense, that means that the driver!,] under either the circumstance of taking the [alcohol concentration] test or refusing the [alcohol concentration] test[,] would face suspension!,] and, therefore, the loss of the [commercial driver\u2019s license]. I don\u2019t believe [that] there is a requirement that the driver be advised of this aspect because!,] under either circumstance, no matter what decision the driver would make, the [commercial driver\u2019s license] would have to be converted to a non[-]commercial license. There\u2019s no decision [that] the driver could make with [0].15 or greater in his or her system that would not result in the [commercial driver\u2019s license\u2019s] being disqualified. The case law aspect in light of that common[ ]sense factual argument, I have to go back to <em>Hare v[. Motor </em><page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"159\">*159</page-number><em>Vehicle Admin.], </em>826 Md. 296[, 604 A.2d 914 (1992) ], and <em>Hare </em>generally is not cited anymore because the [General Assembly] amended [TR] 16-205.1. But the principle in <em>Hare </em>that was announced is still valid[,] and that is, due process does not require that the driver be told of every conceivable incentive for taking a chemical test for alcohol[,] or even[ ] one additional incentive [that is] not required by [TR] 16-205.1. And[,] in fact, the law favors the taking of the [alcohol concentration] test. This is actually not a refusal case. But again, the consequences were described in the [Advice of Rights form], the eligibility for the Ignition Interlock [System Program], and not every conceivable outcome has to be explained. So[,] for those reasons[,] I am going to deny your motion.</blockquote>\n<p id=\"b191-5\">(Italics and paragraph breaks omitted). Seenath\u2019s counsel responded:</p>\n<blockquote id=\"b191-7\">[I]f the MVA and the case law and the courts are going to say[,] use this form, right, give him some advice, the advice should be accurate.... [I]f you\u2019re going to advise someone of these rights, you got to tell them the significant things, and the significant thing being, he\u2019s not eligible really for a restrictive] license and keeping his [commercial driver\u2019s license].</blockquote>\n<p id=\"b191-8\">The ALJ stated: \u201c[Y]our argument is preserved[.]\u201d</p>\n<p id=\"b191-9\">Through counsel, Seenath declined to participate in the Ignition Interlock System Program. In making conclusions of law, the ALJ stated:</p>\n<blockquote id=\"b191-12\">You argued that[,] because you had a [commercial driver\u2019s license], the Advice of Rights [form] did not fully inform you of the administrative sanctions to be imposed. However, the consequences of refusing or taking the [alcohol concentration] test and scoring [0].15 or higher would be the same for a [commercial driver\u2019s license\u2019s] disqualification. <em>Hare[], </em>326 Md. 296[, 604 A.2d 914] indicates [that] the drivers need not be advised of every conceivable outcome concerning submitting to or refusing an alcohol [concentration] test. <em>Hill v[. Motor Vehicle Admin.], </em>4[15] Md. 231[, <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"160\">*160</page-number>999 A.2d 1019] (2010) addressed the [commercial driver\u2019s license] issue vis-\u00e1-vis[ ] the participation of the Ignition Interlock [System P]rogram.</blockquote>\n<p id=\"b192-4\">(Italics and paragraph breaks omitted). The ALJ concluded that Seenath had violated TR \u00a7 16-205.1, and suspended Seenath\u2019s commercial driver\u2019s license for 90 days. On the same day as the administrative hearing, the ALJ issued an order to the same effect. As a result of having consented to take the alcohol concentration test \u2014 as opposed to refusing to take the alcohol concentration test \u2014 Seenath\u2019s ability to drive commercial motor vehicles was not disqualified for one year.</p>\n<p id=\"b192-5\">Proceedings in the Circuit Court</p>\n<p id=\"b192-6\">On June 4, 2015, Seenath petitioned for judicial review. On October 21, 2015, the Circuit Court for Montgomery County (\u201cthe circuit court\u201d) conducted a hearing. The circuit court reversed the decision of the ALJ and ruled in pertinent part as follows:</p>\n<blockquote id=\"b192-7\">[T]he [Advice of Rights] form need not advise a driver of every possible contingency that might be available with regard to the suspension of his [or her] driver\u2019s license. However, the [Advice of Rights] form must advise the driver of the sanctions that the [General Assembly] had mandated for inclusion in the form, and those sanctions are found in [TR \u00a7] 16-205.1[ ]. But the [Advice of Rights form] must also inform the driver of sanctions that are required, not mere potential sanctions. It\u2019s also clear that the continued possession of a driver\u2019s license is essential to earning a livelihood, and it cannot be suspended without due process of law. Due process requires that the officer advise the driver of the applicable sanctions [that] exist. It is clear that the suspension of a [commercial driver\u2019s] license for taking and failing a breath test is a certainty. The holder of a [commercial driver\u2019s] license will receive a 45-day suspension for a first test failure and a 90-day suspension for a subsequent failure or a[n alcohol concentration] test result above a [0].15.... It fails to adequately advise the petitioner of the sanctions that he [or she] faces for failing to pass <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"161\">*161</page-number>the breathalyzer test. It\u2019s particularly egregious ... when the [A]dvice of [RJights [form] ... partially address[es] the consequences of refusing to submit to a[n alcohol concentration] test while driving a non-commercial motor vehicle while holding a commercial driver\u2019s license, but then fails to go on to advise the petitioner of the consequences of failing to pass the breathalyzer test. Due process dictates that he be so advised. The law requires that he be so advised. Accordingly, I\u2019m going to reverse the decision of the [ALJ], [and] vacate the suspension that was imposed.</blockquote>\n<p id=\"b193-4\">(Paragraph breaks omitted). On the same day as the hearing, the circuit court issued an order to the same effect.</p>\n<p id=\"b193-5\">Afterward, on November 25, 2015, the MVA petitioned for a writ of <em>certiorari. </em>On January 27, 2016, this Court granted the petition. <em>See Motor Vehicle Admin. v. Seenath, </em>446 Md. 218, 130 A.3d 507 (2016).</p>\n<p id=\"b193-6\">DISCUSSION</p>\n<p id=\"Afy\">The Parties\u2019 Contentions</p>\n<p id=\"b193-7\">The MVA contends that the Advice of Rights form that Seenath signed satisfied due process. The MVA argues that Seenath\u2019s right to due process was not violated because the Advice of Rights form did not prejudice Seenath, a first-time offender who chose to consent to take an alcohol concentration test and whose commercial driver\u2019s license was suspended for 90 days due to an alcohol concentration of 0.15; as the Advice of Rights form stated, Seenath\u2019s commercial driver\u2019s license would have been suspended for 120 days if Seenath had chosen to refuse to take an alcohol concentration test, and his ability to drive commercial vehicles would have been disqualified for one year.</p>\n<p id=\"b193-8\">Seenath responds that the Advice of Rights form violated his right to due process because it did not inform him that, if he failed an alcohol concentration test, his commercial driver\u2019s license would necessarily be suspended, and he would be ineligible for a restrictive commercial driver\u2019s license, even if he participated in the Ignition Interlock System Program. <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"162\">*162</page-number>Seenath contends that the Advice of Rights form falsely suggested that, if a commercial driver\u2019s license holder drove a non-commercial motor vehicle and failed an alcohol concentration test, then the result would be either no suspension of the commercial driver\u2019s license, or a suspension with eligibility for a restrictive commercial driver\u2019s license. Seenath argues that, in discussing restrictive licenses, the Advice of Rights form fails to distinguish between commercial driver\u2019s licenses and non-commercial driver\u2019s licenses.</p>\n<p id=\"b194-5\">Standard of Review</p>\n<p id=\"b194-6\">Where, as here, the facts are undisputed, a court determines whether an administrative law judge\u2019s decision \u201cis premised upon an erroneous conclusion of law.\u201d <em>Hill, </em>415 Md. at 239, 999 A.2d at 1023 (citation and internal quotation marks omitted). A court reviews without deference an administrative law judge\u2019s conclusion as to a matter of constitutional law. <em>See Md. State Comptroller of Treasury v. Wynne, </em>431 Md. 147, 161, 64 A.3d 453, 461 (2013), <em>aff'd sub nom. Comptroller of Treasury of Md. v.

TR \u00a7 16-205.1(a)(2) provides for \u201cimplied consent\u201d as follows:</p>\n<blockquote id=\"b194-11\">Any person who drives or attempts to drive a motor vehicle on a highway or on any private property that is used by the public in general in this State is deemed to have consented, subject to the provisions of [Md.Code Ann., Cts. &amp; Jud. Proc. (1973, 2013 RepLVol.) (\u201cCJP\u201d)] \u00a7\u00a7 10-302 through 10-309, [<footnotemark>10</footnotemark>] to take a test if the person should be detained on <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"163\">*163</page-number>suspicion of driving or attempting to drive while under the influence of alcohol, while impaired by alcohol, while so far impaired by any drug, any combination of drugs, or a combination of one or more drugs and alcohol that the person could not drive a vehicle safely, while impaired by a controlled dangerous substance, in violation of an alcohol restriction, or in violation of [TR] \u00a7 16-813 [ (Driving Motor Vehicle with Alcohol Concentration in Blood or Breath Prohibited) ].</blockquote>\n<p id=\"b195-5\">Despite TR \u00a7 16-205.1(a)(2)\u2019s embodiment of \u201cimplied consent,\u201d a person cannot be compelled to take an alcohol concentration test unless the \u201cperson is involved in a motor vehicle accident that results in the death of, or a life[-]threatening injury to, another person and the person is detained by a police officer who has reasonable grounds to believe that the person has been driving or attempting to drive while\u201d impaired, TR \u00a7 16-205.1(c)(l); <em>see </em>TR \u00a7 16-205.1(b)(l) (\u201cExcept as provided in [TR \u00a7 16-205.1](c) [ ], a person may not be compelled to take a test.\u201d). In other words, if a driver has not been involved in a motor vehicle accident that results in death or a life-threatening injury to another person, then the driver may refuse to take an alcohol concentration test. In the absence of a motor vehicle accident that results in death or a life-threatening injury to another person, if a person is detained on suspicion of driving or attempting to drive under the influence of drugs or alcohol, the person is deemed under the implied consent law to have consented to alcohol or drug testing, and is subject to a mandatory suspension of his or her driver\u2019s license for not consenting to take a test.</p>\n<p id=\"b195-6\">Indeed, refusing to take an alcohol concentration test has serious consequences. If a driver refuses to take an alcohol concentration test, then the MVA must suspend the driver\u2019s license for 120 days for a first offense, and must suspend the driver\u2019s license for 1 year for a second or subsequent offense. <em>See </em>TR \u00a7 16-205.1(f)(4)(i)(5), (f)(8)(v)(5).</p>\n<p id=\"b196-4\"><page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"164\">*164</page-number>Refusing to take an alcohol concentration test has additional consequences for a holder of a Maryland commercial driver\u2019s license. Specifically, under TR \u00a7 16 \u2014 205.1(f)(4)(ii)(1):</p>\n<blockquote id=\"b196-5\">In the case of a person operating a commercial motor vehicle or who holds ... a commercial driver\u2019s license who refuses to take a test, [the MVA shall] disqualify the person from operating a commercial motor vehicle for a period of 1 year for a first offense, 3 years for a first offense [that] occurs while transporting hazardous materials [that are] required to be placarded, and for life for a second or subsequent offense [that] occurs while operating any commercial [motor] vehicle[.]</blockquote>\n<p id=\"b196-6\">As does refusing to take an alcohol concentration test, failing an alcohol concentration test has serious consequences. The length of the mandatory suspension depends on the driver\u2019s alcohol concentration; the higher the driver\u2019s alcohol concentration, the longer the mandatory suspension. If a driver was not involved in a motor vehicle accident that resulted in the death of another person, and an alcohol concentration test indicates that the driver\u2019s alcohol concentration is at least 0.08 but less than 0.15, then the MVA must suspend the driver\u2019s license for 45 days for a first offense, and must suspend the driver\u2019s license for 90 days for a second or subsequent offense. <em>See </em>TR \u00a7 16-205.1(f)(4)(i)(l), (f)(8)(v)(l). If a driver was not involved in a motor vehicle accident that resulted in the death of another person, and an alcohol concentration test indicates that the driver\u2019s alcohol concentration is 0.15 or higher, then the MVA must suspend the driver\u2019s license for 90 days for a first offense, and must suspend the driver\u2019s license for 180 days for a second or subsequent offense. <em>See </em>TR \u00a7 16-205.1(f)(4)(i)(2), (f)(8)(v)(2). All of these mandatory suspensions apply to commercial driver\u2019s licenses and non-commercial driver\u2019s licenses alike.</p>\n<p id=\"b196-7\">Modifications of Suspensions and Restrictive Licenses</p>\n<p id=\"b196-8\">Under certain circumstances, the MVA may issue a modification of a suspension or a restrictive license, which allows a driver to drive only for certain purposes \u2014 for example, in the <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"165\">*165</page-number>course of employment. A driver is eligible for a modification of a suspension or a restrictive license without participation in the Ignition Interlock System Program \u2014 which we describe below \u2014 only if an alcohol concentration test indicates an alcohol concentration of at least 0.08 but less than 0.15, and, during the past 5 years, the driver\u2019s license has not been suspended under TR \u00a7 16-205.1 and the driver has not been convicted under TR \u00a7 21-902 (Driving While Under the Influence or Impairment of Alcohol or Drugs Prohibited). <em>See </em>TR \u00a7 16-205.1(n)(l). TR \u00a7 16-205.1(n)(2) describes additional criteria for a modification of a suspension or a restrictive license without participation in the Ignition Interlock System Program as follows:</p>\n<blockquote id=\"b197-5\">The [MVA] may modify a suspension under [TR \u00a7 16-205.1] or issue a restrictive license if the [MVA] finds that:</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b197-6\">(i) The licensee is required to drive a motor vehicle in the course of employment;</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b197-7\">(ii) The license is required for the purpose of attending an alcohol prevention or treatment program;</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b197-8\">(iii) The licensee has no alternative means of transportation available to or from the licensee\u2019s place of employment and, without the license, the licensee\u2019s ability to earn a living would be severely impaired;</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b197-9\">(iv) The license is required for the purpose of obtaining health care treatment, including a prescription, that is necessary for the licensee or a member of the licensee\u2019s immediate family and the licensee and the licensee\u2019s immediate family have no alternative means of transportation available to obtain the health care treatment; or</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b197-10\">(v) The license is required for the purpose of attending a noncollegiate educational institution ... or a regular program at an institution of postsecondary education.</blockquote>\n<p id=\"b197-11\">As explained above, however, under TR \u00a7 16-205.1(f)(4)(ii)(l), the MVA must \u201cdisqualify\u201d a holder of a Maryland commercial driver\u2019s license from driving a commercial motor vehicle for at least 1 year if he or she refuses to take an alcohol concentration test. Under that circumstance, <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"166\">*166</page-number>the holder of the Maryland commercial driver\u2019s license is ineligible for a modification of the disqualification or a restrictive commercial driver\u2019s license. <em>See </em>TR \u00a7 16-205.1(f)(8)(vii) (\u201cA disqualification of ... a commercial driver\u2019s license is not subject to any modifications, nor may a restricted ... commercial driver\u2019s license be issued in lieu of a disqualification.\u201d). In other words, if a holder of a Maryland commercial driver\u2019s license refuses to take an alcohol concentration test, then he or she will be disqualified from driving a commercial motor vehicle for at least 1 year, and he or she will be ineligible for a modification of the disqualification or a restrictive commercial driver\u2019s license \u2014 even if the holder of the Maryland commercial driver\u2019s license participates in the Ignition Interlock System Program.</p>\n<p id=\"b198-5\">Similarly, if a holder of a Maryland commercial driver\u2019s license fails an alcohol concentration test, then he or she is ineligible for a restrictive commercial driver\u2019s license \u2014 even if the holder of the Maryland commercial driver\u2019s license participates in the Ignition Interlock System Program. COMAR 11.11.12.07A provides that \u201cthe [MVA] may not issue any type of temporary, conditional, or work[-]restricted license permitting an individual to drive a commercial motor vehicle during any period in which the individual\u2019s driving privilege is disqualified, refused, cancelled, suspended, or revoked in this or any other state in accordance with [TR] \u00a7[ ]16-808 [ (Persons Ineligible to Drive Commercial Motor Vehicles) ] and 49 CFR \u00a7[ ]384.210 [ (Limitation on Licensing) ].\u201d Also, TR \u00a7 16-808(a)(5) provides that \u201c[a] person may not drive a commercial motor vehicle on any highway ... [w]hile the person\u2019s driver\u2019s license ... is suspended in this State[.]\u201d</p>\n<p id=\"b198-6\">In short, under TR \u00a7 16 \u2014 205.1 (f)(8)(vii) and COMAR 11.11.12.07A, there is no such thing as a \u201crestrictive commercial driver\u2019s license.\u201d A holder of a commercial driver\u2019s license may participate in the Ignition Interlock System Program, but doing so will not result in a restrictive commercial driver\u2019s license; instead, participation in the Ignition Interlock System Program may result only in a modification of a <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"167\">*167</page-number>suspension, under which the driver will be allowed to drive only non-commercial motor vehicles. <em>See, e.g., Hill, </em>415 Md. at 239, 999 A.2d at 1023 (An administrative law judge modified a suspension of a commercial driver\u2019s license so that the driver could drive non-commercial motor vehicles while participating in the Ignition Interlock System Program.).</p>\n<p id=\"b199-4\">Ignition Interlock System Program</p>\n<p id=\"b199-5\">It is possible for the MVA to issue a modification of a suspension or a restrictive license even if a driver refused to take an alcohol concentration test; an alcohol concentration test indicated an alcohol concentration of at least 0.15; or an alcohol concentration test indicated an alcohol concentration of at least 0.08 but less than 0.15, but the driver does not otherwise satisfy TR \u00a7 16-205.1(n)\u2019s criteria. <em>See </em>TR \u00a7 16-205.1 <em>(o </em>)(1). Under these circumstances, the MVA may issue a modification of a suspension or a restrictive license if and only if the driver participates in the Ignition Interlock System Program for 1 year. <em>See </em>TR \u00a7 16-205.1(o )(2). \u201cA participant is considered to begin participation in the [Ignition Interlock System] Program when the participant provides evidence of the installation of an ignition interlock system by an approved service provider in a manner required by the [MVA].\u201d TR \u00a7 16-404.1(h).

A law enforcement officer arrested the driver for driving while impaired, and read to the driver from the Advice of Rights form. <em>See id. </em>at 298, 604 A.2d at 914-15. The law enforcement officer requested that the driver consent to take an alcohol concentration test, which the driver refused to take; accordingly, the MVA suspended his driver\u2019s license for 120 days. <em>See id. </em>at 298-99, 604 A.2d at 915. The driver requested an administrative hearing, at which he testified that he had not known that he would be ineligible for a modification of a suspension or a restrictive license if he refused to take an alcohol concentration test;<footnotemark>11</footnotemark> the driver testified that, had he known as much, he probably would have consented to take an alcohol concentration test. <em>See id. </em>at 297-99, 604 A.2d at 914-15. An administrative law judge imposed the same sanction that the MVA did. <em>See id. </em>at 299, 604 A.2d at 915.</p>\n<p id=\"b205-5\">In this Court, the driver contended that the Advice of Rights form violated his right to due process because it did not fully advise him of administrative sanctions. <em>See id. </em>at 301, 604 A.2d at 916. This Court explained the right to due process as follows:</p>\n<blockquote id=\"b205-6\">The continued possession of a driver\u2019s license may become essential to earning a livelihood; as such, it is an entitlement [that] cannot be taken without the due process [that is] mandated by the Fourteenth Amendment.... What process a [person] is due is, of course, dependent upon the facts and circumstances of the case. To make that determination, we have to examine the importance of the life, liberty, or property interest at stake and the extent to which <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"174\">*174</page-number>the questioned procedure might produce the possibility of uninformed decision-making. Against the individual\u2019s interest, we must weigh the State\u2019s legitimate competing interest, which necessarily includes the avoidance of the increased administrative or fiscal burdens resulting from the requested procedure.</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b206-4\">As we have seen, [the driver\u2019s interest in his driver\u2019s license is an important one. Juxtaposed against that interest is the State\u2019s interest in protecting its citizens from drunk drivers[,] and, as a means of doing so, encouraging suspected drunk drivers to take the [alcohol concentration] test, thus facilitating their prosecution. The final factor to be considered is whether the procedure chosen enhances informed decision-making.</blockquote>\n<p id=\"b206-5\"><em>Id. </em>at 301, 303, 604 A.2d at 916, 917 (brackets, citations, ellipsis, and internal quotation marks omitted).</p>\n<p id=\"b206-6\">This Court rejected the driver\u2019s contention that the Advice of Rights form violated his right to due process, stating:</p>\n<blockquote id=\"Agd\">A driver need not be told of every conceivable incentive for taking a[n alcohol concentration test] or, for that matter, even one additional incentive [that is] not required by [TR \u00a7 16-205.1]. This conclusion is, we think, buttressed both by Maryland law and [by] common sense. As to the latter, when it is once determined that a driver must be apprised of additional incentives, there is no rational basis for determining which of those additional incentives must be covered and which are not of sufficient value to merit inclusion in the advice given the arrestee.... [D]ue process does not always require the State affirmatively to inform a [person] of the availability of options that might influence decision-making. It requires no more than that the State not mislead the [person] or construct road[ ]blocks, thus unduly burdening that decision-making....</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b206-7\">Having provided the advice [that was] mandated by [TR \u00a7 16-205.1], the [law enforcement] officer was not required to anticipate, or guess at, what incentive would have caused the driver to take the [alcohol concentration] test. Nor was <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"175\">*175</page-number>he, as a matter of due process, required to provide any advice other than that [which TR \u00a7 16-205.1] prescribed. Indeed, had he undertaken to provide additional information[,] and it turned out to be misleading or inaccurate, that, in itself, may have been a denial of due process. Due process does not require the officer to weigh the relative merits, for encouragement value, of particular consequences flowing from the decision whether to take or refuse a[n alcohol concentration] test.</blockquote>\n<p id=\"b207-5\"><em>Id. </em>at 304, 306, 604 A.2d at 918-19 (citations and paragraph break omitted).</p>\n<p id=\"b207-6\">In <em>Motor Vehicle Admin. v. Chamberlain, </em>326 Md. 306, 319-20, 604 A.2d 919, 925 (1992), this Court commented on a driver\u2019s right to due process in the form of being advised of administrative sanctions. In <em>Chamberlain, id. </em>at 309, 604 A.2d at 920, a law enforcement officer arrested the driver for driving while impaired, and read to the driver from the then-current Advice of Rights form. The law enforcement officer requested that the driver consent to take an alcohol concentration test, which the driver refused to take; accordingly, the MVA suspended his driver\u2019s license for 120 days. <em>See id. </em>at 310-11, 604 A.2d at 920-21. The driver requested an administrative hearing, at which he asserted that he had not been adequately advised of the administrative sanctions for failing or refusing to take an alcohol concentration test. <em>See id. </em>at 311, 604 A.2d at 921. An administrative law judge imposed the same sanction that the MVA did. <em>See id. </em>at 311, 312, 604 A.2d at 921.</p>\n<p id=\"b207-7\">The driver petitioned for judicial review, and a trial court reversed the administrative law judge\u2019s decision, concluding that the driver had not been fully advised of administrative sanctions because he had not been informed that a failure of an alcohol concentration test could result in a modification of a suspension or a restrictive license. <em>See id. </em>at 312, 604 A.2d at 922. Although the trial court concluded that the omission of the advisement was a violation of the driver\u2019s right to due process, <em>see id. </em>at 312, 604 A.2d at 922, this Court expressly declined to address the issue as to due process because the <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"176\">*176</page-number>driver did not pursue the issue in this Court, <em>see id. </em>at 308 n. 2, 604 A.2d at 920 n. 2 (\u201cIn his brief, not only does [the driver] refrain from making any constitutional arguments ..., but [also,] he conceded at oral argument that he did not raise the constitutional issues in the first instance, the trial court having done so on its own, and, further, that his research did not support the [trial] court\u2019s determinations. Thus, we conclude that the [driver] no longer wishes to pursue the constitutional issues. We will not, therefore, further consider them.\u201d).</p>\n<p id=\"b208-5\">In this Court, the driver contended that TR \u00a7 16-205.1 required a law enforcement officer to inform drivers that, unlike a refusal to take an alcohol concentration test, a failure of an alcohol concentration test could result in a modification of a suspension or a restrictive license. <em>See id. </em>at 314, 604 A.2d at 922. This Court rejected the driver\u2019s contention, and concluded that TR \u00a7 16-205.1 does not require a law enforcement officer to give any advisements that are not already expressly listed in TR \u00a7 16-205.1(b). <em>See id. </em>at 317, 604 A.2d at 924 (\u201cThe [General Assembly] ... explicitly set out in [TR] \u00a7 16-205.1(b)(l) what a driver must be told upon detention.\u201d). This Court also noted that \u201cthe <em>possible </em>eligibility for\u201d a modification of a suspension or a restrictive license was a \u201creward\u201d or \u201cincentive\u201d that was not a \u201csanction\u201d of which a law enforcement needed to inform a driver. <em>See id. </em>at 318, 604 A.2d at 924 (emphasis in original).<footnotemark>12</footnotemark></p>\n<p id=\"b208-6\">As noted above, this Court expressly declined to address whether the omission of the advisement about modifications of <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"177\">*177</page-number>suspensions and restrictive licenses was a violation of the driver\u2019s right to due process, <em>see Chamberlain, </em>326 Md. at 308 n. 2, 604 A.2d at 920 n. 2; however, in the context of explaining why a modification of a suspension or a restrictive license was a mere possibility rather than a certainty, this Court stated:</p>\n<blockquote id=\"b209-5\">[I]t is not certain that, upon failure of the [alcohol concentration] test, the driver\u2019s suspension will be modified or a restrictive license issued. Thus, any advice that fails to make clear that a reference to modification of suspension or a restrictive license relates to eligibility only is likely to lead to confusion. In point of fact, telling someone who may or may not meet the statutory prerequisites, as encouragement to take the [alcohol concentration] test, that he or she \u201cmay be entitled to a modified suspension or restrictive license,\u201d may be not simply inaccurate, and affirmatively misleading, it may not be an incentive at all. This is especially likely to be the case when the police officer, not having checked the driving record, tells a person who does not meet any of the statutory prerequisites that he or she may qualify for a modification of suspension or restrictive license if he or she takes the [alcohol concentration] test. And it is also egregious when, though eligible, the person is not absolutely <em>entitled </em>to the relief which is the subject of the advice. Thus, it would be impossible to advise a driver without checking the driving record and, if checked, guessing not only as to the driver\u2019s eligibility, but also the likelihood that he or she would be favorably considered. For this reason as well[,] \u201csanctions\u201d can only refer to an outcome that is certain to happen. The suspension of the driver\u2019s license must occur whenever the statutory prerequisites have been met, whether the driver refuses the [alcohol concentration] test or fails the [alcohol concentration] test after taking it.</blockquote>\n<p id=\"A-H\"><em>Id. </em>at 319-20, 604 A.2d at 925-26 (italics in original) (citations and footnote omitted). In a footnote that immediately followed the words \u201caffirmatively misleading\u201d (as quoted above), this Court observed: \u201cIt may be that affirmatively to mislead the driver is to violate the driver\u2019s right to due process.\u201d <em>Id. </em><page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"178\">*178</page-number>at 319 n. 9, 604 A.2d at 925 n. 9 (citing <em>Hare, </em>326 Md. at 306, 604 A.2d at 919).</p>\n<p id=\"b210-4\">In <em>Hill, </em>415 Md. at 248, 999 A.2d at 1028-29, this Court held that the then-current Advice of Rights form did not violate a driver\u2019s right to due process. In <em>Hill, id. </em>at 236, 999 A.2d at 1022, the driver, a holder of a commercial driver\u2019s license, was driving a non-commercial motor vehicle. A law enforcement officer arrested the driver for driving while impaired, and read to the driver the entirety of the Advice of Rights form. <em>See id. </em>at 236, 999 A.2d at 1022. The law enforcement officer requested that the driver consent to take an alcohol concentration test, which the driver refused to take; accordingly, the MVA suspended his commercial driver\u2019s license for 120 days and disqualified him from driving a commercial motor vehicle for 1 year. <em>See id. </em>at 238-39, 999 A.2d at 1023. In other words, the driver would be unable to drive any vehicle for 120 days, after which the driver would be able to drive only noncommercial motor vehicles until 1 year had passed since the disqualification began. The driver requested an administrative hearing, at which the driver argued that the Advice of Rights form misled him by failing to state that, if he refused to take an alcohol concentration test, the MVA would necessarily disqualify him from driving a commercial motor vehicle for 1 year, regardless of whether the driver participated in the Ignition Interlock System Program. <em>See id. </em>at 238, 999 A.2d at 1023. An administrative law judge rejected the driver\u2019s contention, modified the suspension so that the driver could drive non-commercial motor vehicles while participating in the Ignition Interlock System Program for 1 year, and otherwise imposed the same sanction that the MVA did. <em>See id. </em>at 238-39, 999 A.2d at 1023.</p>\n<p id=\"b210-5\">In this Court, the driver asserted that the Advice of Rights form prejudiced him because he would have consented to taking an alcohol concentration test in the hopes that his alcohol concentration was less than 0.08 had the Advice of Rights form stated that, if the driver refused to take an alcohol concentration test, the MVA would disqualify him from driving a commercial motor vehicle for 1 year, regardless of <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"179\">*179</page-number>whether the driver participated in the Ignition Interlock System Program. <em>See id. </em>at 242, 999 A.2d at 1025. The driver contended that the Advice of Rights form misled holders of commercial driver\u2019s licenses to believe that they could refuse alcohol concentration tests and avoid being disqualified from driving commercial vehicles by participating in the Ignition Interlock System Program. <em>See id. </em>at 245, 999 A.2d at 1027.</p>\n<p id=\"A40\">This Court rejected the driver\u2019s contention, stating:</p>\n<blockquote id=\"b211-5\">[T]he [Advice of Rights] form properly advised [the driver] of the penalties [that] he faced, and did not obstruct [the driver\u2019s decision-making process. The text of the [Advice of Rights] form is plain. The following language is included under the heading \u201cSuspension of Your Maryland Driver\u2019s License or Driving Privilege:\u201d</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b211-6\">If you refuse to submit to a test: The suspension will be 120 days for a first offense and one year for a second or subsequent offense.

If you hold a commercial driver\u2019s license [ ] at the time you refuse to submit to a test, your [commercial driver\u2019s license] or privilege will be disqualified for 1 year.</blockquote>\n<p id=\"AsT\">(Emphasis added.) This language straightforwardly informs a suspected drunk driver that [commercial driver\u2019s license] driving privileges will be suspended for a full year in the event that the driver refuses to submit to an alcohol concentration test. This provision is one of only two references to a [commercial driver\u2019s license] on the whole of the [Advice of Rights] form; the second addresses offenses occurring while actually driving a commercial [motor] vehicle. The language reproduced above is unequivocal \u2014 it does not offer any suggestion of mitigation or an alternative, nor should it, as no such mitigation or alternative is possible under [TR \u00a7 16-205.1].</p>\n<blockquote id=\"b212-4\"><page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"180\">*180</page-number>The heading immediately below this language, entitled \u201cModification of the Suspension or Issuance of a Restrictive License,\u201d is the first place at which the [Advice of Rights] form mentions the possibility of modifying suspensions through the issuance of a restrictive] license or participation in the [Ignition] Interlock [System] Program. There are two significant points of interest here. First, as the MVA discusses in its brief, this section explicitly refers to suspensions, and not disqualifications. At no point under this heading does the language of [the Advice of Rights form] discuss disqualified licenses, or use a disjunctive phrase such as \u201csuspension or disqualification\u201d in referring to the [Ignition] Interlock [System] Program. Second, and more significantly, at no point does the language under this heading mention a [commercial driver\u2019s license] or commercial driving privileges. Again, there are but two mentions of a [commercial driver\u2019s license] on the [Advice of Rights] form, and neither is incorporated into a section addressing mitigation of, or alternatives to, [commercial driver\u2019s license] disqualification. On the whole, these passages are clear and unambiguous, and neither create roadblocks to inhibit a driver\u2019s decision-making process nor incompletely advise a driver of the applicable sanctions under [TR \u00a7 16-205.1].</blockquote>\n<p id=\"b212-5\"><em>Id. </em>at 245-46, 999 A.2d at 1027-28 (brackets and footnotes omitted).</p>\n<p id=\"b212-6\">This Court summarized its holding as follows: \u201c[The driver]\u2019s due process rights were not violated during his traffic stop because the information [that was] conveyed to him in the [Advice of Rights] form was not misleading, and did not obstruct his ability to make an informed decision about whether to refuse an alcohol concentration test.\u201d <em>Id. </em>at 248, 999 A.2d at 1028.<footnotemark>13</footnotemark></p>\n<p id=\"b213-4\"><page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"181\">*181</page-number>As-Applied Challenges and Facial Challenges</p>\n<p id=\"b213-5\">Here, as a preliminary matter, we observe that it is unclear from the proceedings before the ALJ whether Seenath raised an as-applied or a facial constitutional challenge to the Advice of Rights form. An as-applied challenge is \u201ca claim that a statutet[<footnotemark>14</footnotemark>] is unconstitutional on the facts of a particular case or in its application to a particular party.\u201d As-Applied Challenge, Black\u2019s Law Dictionary (10th ed.2014). By contrast, a facial challenge is \u201c[a] claim that a statute is unconstitutional on its face \u2014 that is, that it always operates unconstitutionally.\u201d Facial Challenge, Black\u2019s Law Dictionary (10th ed.2014). In other words, to be successful, a facial challenge \u201cmust establish that there is no set of circumstances under which the [statute] would be constitutional.]\u201d <em>Harrison-Solomon v. State, </em>442 Md. 254, 287, 112 A.3d 408, 428 (2015) (citation omitted).</p>\n<p id=\"b213-6\">A party always has standing to raise an as-applied challenge, but a party has standing to raise a facial challenge only if the statute or practice that is the subject of the facial challenge may violate a fundamental constitutional right. <em>See Galloway v. State, </em>365 Md. 599, 616-17, 781 A.2d 851, 861 (2001) (\u201cIf the challenged statute ... encroaches upon fundamental constitutional rights, particularly First Amendment guarantees of free speech and assembly, then the statute should be scrutinized for vagueness on its face.... [Permitting a defendant to challenge a statute on its face for vague<page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"182\">*182</page-number>ness becomes a rule of standing which allows a defendant to challenge the validity of a statute even though the statute as applied to the defendant is constitutional.\u201d (Citations, footnotes, and internal quotation marks omitted)).</p>\n<p id=\"b214-4\">Typically, a facial challenge in which a party contends that a statute is void-for-vagueness arises out of a right under the First Amendment to the United States Constitution. <em>See id. </em>at 616 n. 11, 781 A.2d at 861 n. 11 (\u201cWe have not applied [the void-for-vagueness] standard to a facial challenge other than one implicating First Amendment rights.\u201d (Citation omitted)). Other types of facial challenges, however, have arisen out of fundamental constitutional rights other than those that the First Amendment protects. <em>See, e.g., King v. State, </em>425 Md. 550, 593, 601, 42 A.3d 549, 575, 580 (2012), rev\u2019d,-U.S.-, 133 S.Ct. 1958, 186 L.Ed.2d 1 (2013) (This Court considered a facial challenge to a DNA collection statute that arose out of the rights under the Search-and-Seizure Clause of the Fourth Amendment to the United States Constitution.); <em>Tyler v.

Instead, in this case, the right at issue is the right to due process where the State imposes a sanction on a driver\u2019s license. <em>See Hill, </em>415 Md. at 242, 999 A.2d at 1025 (\u201c[T]he continued possession of a driver\u2019s license may become essential to earning a livelihood; it is, therefore, an entitlement that may not be taken away without the due process mandated by the Fourteenth Amendment.\u201d (Citation and internal quotation marks omitted)); <em>Hare, </em>326 Md. at 301, 604 A.2d at 916 (same). As did the parties who raised facial challenges that arose out of the right to due process in <em>Tyler, </em>415 Md. at 502, 494, 3 A.3d at 436, 431-32, and <em>Griffin, </em>403 Md. at 195-96, 941 A.2d at 480-81, here, Seenath has standing to raise a facial challenge that arises out of the right to due process.</p>\n<p id=\"b215-5\">As stated above, it is unclear whether Seenath raised an as-applied challenge or a facial challenge to the Advice of Rights form. At the administrative hearing, Seenath\u2019s counsel contended that the Advice of Rights form is \u201cincorrect as it applies to\u201d Seenath. By contrast, in his brief, Seenath argues that the Advice of Rights form gives \u201cerroneous advice [ ] to [commercial driver\u2019s license] holders[.]\u201d And, at oral argument, in response to a question about whether the alleged violation of due process occurred as to Seenath in particular or holders of commercial driver\u2019s licenses in general, Seenath\u2019s counsel responded: \u201cBoth.\u201d</p>\n<p id=\"b215-6\">In the petition for a writ of <em>certiorari, </em>however, the MVA presented an issue that encompasses both an as-applied and a facial challenge: \u201cDoes the standard Advice of Rights form (DR-15) provide the necessary information to a driver who holds a commercial driver\u2019s license of the consequences of submitting to a test of blood alcohol content if the driver\u2019s results are 0.08 or more?\u201d Given that the MVA has framed the issue broadly to include both the as-applied and facial validity of the Advice of Rights form \u2014 and, in doing so, <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"184\">*184</page-number>undoubtedly seeks guidance from this Court as to the propriety of the Advice of Rights form\u2019s future use \u2014 we address both the as-applied issue and the facial issue. We address the as-applied issue first. <em>See King, </em>425 Md. at 593, 42 A.3d at 575 (\u201cIt is generally preferable for a court to analyze whether a statute is constitutional under the more narrow as-applied standard first, as a matter of judicial efficiency[,] rather than analyzing the broader facial challenge first.\u201d (Citation omitted)).</p>\n<p id=\"b216-5\">As-Applied Challenge</p>\n<p id=\"b216-6\">We have no difficulty in concluding that the Advice of Rights form does not violate the Due Process Clause as applied in this case, as the record contains no indication whatsoever that Seenath was misled by the Advice of Rights form. At the administrative hearing, Seenath did not testify about any matter pertaining to the Advice of Rights form. In other words, Seenath did not testify that he was misled by the Advice of Rights form into consenting to take an alcohol concentration test; that he might have chosen to refuse to take an alcohol concentration test had the Advice of Rights form provided additional information; or that the Advice of Rights form caused him to incorrectly believe that, if he failed an alcohol concentration test, he would be eligible for a restrictive license. <em>Cf. Hare, </em>326 Md. at 297-99, 604 A.2d at 914-15 (At an administrative hearing, a driver testified that he probably would have consented to take an alcohol concentration test had he known that he would be ineligible for a modification of a suspension or a restrictive license if he refused to take an alcohol concentration test.). Additionally, nothing in the Officer\u2019s Certification and Order of Suspension or the Advice of Rights form that Seenath signed indicates that Seenath expressed any confusion about the Advice of Rights form, or asked any questions about the consequences of failing or refusing to take an alcohol concentration test. In short, Seenath has failed to establish any link between his decision to consent to take an alcohol concentration test and <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"185\">*185</page-number>any alleged omission or misleading information in the Advice of Rights form.</p>\n<p id=\"b217-4\">As the MVA points out, another factor to be considered in determining whether the Advice of Rights violated Seenath\u2019s right to due process is whether Seenath was prejudiced in any way by his decision to consent to take an alcohol concentration test. In this case, Seenath incurred no negative consequences as result of the decision to take \u2014 rather than refuse to take\u2014 an alcohol concentration test. Seenath was a first-time offender; the alcohol concentration test indicated an alcohol concentration of 0.15; and, in accordance with TR \u00a7 16-205.1(f)(8)(v)(2), the ALJ suspended Seenath\u2019s commercial driver\u2019s license for 90 days. If Seenath had refused to take an alcohol concentration test, then the ALJ would have been required to not only suspend Seenath\u2019s commercial driver\u2019s license for 120 days, <em>see </em>TR \u00a7 16-205.1(f)(8)(v)(5), but also to disqualify Seenath from driving commercial motor vehicles for 1 year, <em>see </em>TR \u00a7 16 \u2014 205.1(f)(4)(ii)(1). In other words, because he decided to take the alcohol concentration test, Seenath was subject to a mandatory suspension that was 30 days shorter than it would have been had he refused to take the alcohol concentration test, and Seenath avoided being disqualified from driving commercial motor vehicles for 1 year. As explained above, TR \u00a7 16-205.1(f)(8)(vii) and COMAR 11.11.12.07A do not provide for a \u201crestrictive commercial driver\u2019s license\u201d; thus, Seenath was ineligible for a restrictive commercial driver\u2019s license, regardless of whether he failed or refused to take the alcohol concentration test.</p>\n<p id=\"b217-5\">Seenath suffered no prejudice as a result of his decision to consent to take an alcohol concentration test. <em>Cf. Hill, </em>415 Md. at 242, 999 A.2d at 1025 (A driver asserted that the Advice of Rights form prejudiced him because he would have consented to taking an alcohol concentration test in the hopes that his alcohol concentration was less than 0.08 had the Advice of Rights form stated that, if the driver refused to take an alcohol concentration test, the MVA would disqualify him from driving a commercial motor vehicle for 1 year, regardless of whether the driver participated in the Ignition Interlock <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"186\">*186</page-number>System Program.). In sum, Seenath has not alleged that he was misled in any way by the Advice of Rights form, and he was not prejudiced by his decision to take the alcohol concentration test. We discern no constitutional violation with respect to use of the Advice of Rights form as applied to Seenath.</p>\n<p id=\"b218-5\">Facial Challenge</p>\n<p id=\"b218-6\">Having addressed the as-applied challenge, we turn to the facial issue. We must decide whether the Advice of Rights form comports with due process in general. Specifically, the question in this case is whether the Advice of Rights form is misleading as to a commercial driver\u2019s license holder\u2019s eligibility for a restrictive license where the commercial driver\u2019s license holder drives a non-commercial motor vehicle and fails an alcohol concentration test.<footnotemark>15</footnotemark> <em>See Hill, </em>415 Md. at 248, 999 A.2d at 1028 (\u201c[The driver\u2019s due process rights were not violated during his traffic stop because the information conveyed to him in the [Advice of Rights] form was not misleading, and did not obstruct his ability to make an informed decision about whether to refuse an alcohol concentration test.\u201d).</p>\n<p id=\"b218-7\">In reaching our decision, we must weigh the detained driver\u2019s interests \u2014 which include making informed decisions about whether to consent to take alcohol concentration tests and being able to earn a living by driving \u2014 against the State\u2019s interests, which include protecting the public, deterring drunk <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"187\">*187</page-number>and/or drugged driving, and encouraging detained drivers to consent to take alcohol concentration tests. <em>See id. </em>at 242, 999 A.2d at 1025 (\u201c[T]he continued possession of a driver\u2019s license may become essential to earning a livelihood.... Accused drunk drivers have a significant interest at stake in deciding whether to submit to a State-administered chemical sobriety test....

The Advice of Rights form advises detained drivers regarding the mandatory suspensions for failing or refusing to take an alcohol concentration test as follows:</p>\n<blockquote id=\"b219-6\">If your test result is an alcohol concentration of at least 0.08 but less than 0.15: The suspension will be 45 days for a first offense and 90 days for a second or subsequent offense. If your test result is an alcohol concentration of 0.15 or more: The suspension will be 90 days for a first offense and 180 days for a second or subsequent offense. If you refuse to submit to a test: The suspension will be 120 days for a first offense and one (1) year for a second or subsequent offense.</blockquote>\n<p id=\"b219-7\">(Bolding and paragraph breaks omitted). All of the above information regarding mandatory suspensions is accurate and applies to holders of commercial driver\u2019s licenses and noncommercial driver\u2019s licenses alike. <em>See </em>TR \u00a7 16 \u2014 205.1(f)(4)(i), <em>mm.</em></p>\n<p id=\"b220-4\"><page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"188\">*188</page-number>We find no merit in Seenath\u2019s contention that the Advice of Rights form indicates that the mandatory suspensions apply only to a commercial driver\u2019s license holder\u2019s ability to drive non-commercial vehicles. In no uncertain terms, the Advice of Rights form advises detained drivers that these mandatory suspensions \u201cshall be imposed against your license^]\u201d In no way does the Advice of Rights form imply that these mandatory suspensions apply only to the ability to drive a noncommercial motor vehicle, or that these mandatory suspensions do not apply to commercial driver\u2019s licenses and/or the ability to drive a commercial motor vehicle. Indeed, it would be an absurd result, not consistent with protecting the public from drunk or drugged drivers, if a holder of a commercial driver\u2019s license failed or refused to take an alcohol concentration test and either received no suspension at all, or were prohibited only from driving non-commercial motor vehicles and remained able to drive commercial motor vehicles. Simply put, Seenath is incorrect in contending that the Advice of Rights form indicates that it would be possible for no suspension of a commercial driver\u2019s license to result from a failure of an alcohol concentration test.</p>\n<p id=\"b220-5\">Seenath\u2019s contention that the Advice of Rights form indicates that it would be possible for a restrictive license to result where a holder of a commercial driver\u2019s license fails an alcohol concentration test is also incorrect. Under the heading \u201cModification of the Suspension or Issuance of a Restrictive License,\u201d the Advice of Rights form states, in pertinent part:</p>\n<blockquote id=\"AXB\">If your test result is an alcohol concentration of 0.08 but less than 0.15: The suspension may be modified or a restrictive license issued at a hearing in certain circumstances[.] If you refuse a test, or take a test with a result of 0.15 or more: You will be ineligible for modification of the suspension or issuance of a restrictive license, unless you participate in the Ignition Interlock System Program under [TR] \u00a7 16-404.1[].</blockquote>\n<p id=\"b220-6\">(Paragraph break and some bolding omitted) (some bolding added). To begin, the language describing the issuance of a restrictive license in the Advice of Rights form does not <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"189\">*189</page-number>reference holders of commercial driver\u2019s licenses; <em>i.e., </em>the language in no way affirmatively indicates that a restrictive license is available to holders of commercial driver\u2019s licenses. Seenath appears to rely on the circumstance that, because the language does not distinguish between holders of commercial driver\u2019s licenses and holders of non-commercial driver\u2019s licenses, the language regarding the issuance of a restrictive license must apply to both holders of commercial and non-commercial driver\u2019s licenses. In doing so, Seenath ignores the circumstance that the advisement does not guarantee that any driver will be eligible for a restrictive license. By using the terms \u201cmay\u201d and \u201cin certain circumstances\u201d as qualifiers, the Advice of Rights form makes clear that a detained driver \u2014 a holder of a commercial driver\u2019s license or a holder of a non-commercial driver\u2019s license \u2014 will not necessarily be eligible for a restrictive license if the driver takes an alcohol concentration test that indicates an alcohol concentration of at least 0.08 but less than 0.15. For example, a driver with a non-commercial driver\u2019s license is ineligible for a restrictive license without participating in the Ignition Interlock System Program if, during the past 5 years, the driver\u2019s license has been suspended under TR \u00a7 16-205.1. <em>See </em>TR \u00a7 16-205.1(n)(l)(ii). Similarly, a holder of a commercial driver\u2019s license is ineligible for a restrictive license. <em>See </em>TR \u00a7 16 \u2014 205.1(f)(8)(vii) (\u201cA disqualification of ... a commercial driver\u2019s license is not subject to any modifications, nor may a restricted ... commercial driver\u2019s license be issued in lieu of a disqualification.\u201d); COMAR 11.11.12.07A (\u201cThe [MVA] may not issue any type of temporary, conditional, or work[-]restricted license permitting an individual to drive a commercial motor vehicle during any period in which the individual\u2019s driving privilege is ... suspended[.]\u201d). In short, the Advice of Rights form does not in any way indicate that a driver will with certainty be eligible for a restrictive license if the driver takes an alcohol concentration test that indicates an alcohol concentration of at least 0.08 but less than 0.15. To the contrary, the plain import of the language is that, under certain circumstances, drivers with <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"190\">*190</page-number>either a commercial or non-commercial driver\u2019s license may or may not be eligible for a restrictive license.</p>\n<p id=\"b222-5\">Nor does the Advice of Rights form in any way indicate that a driver will definitely be eligible for a restrictive license if the driver takes an alcohol concentration test that indicates an alcohol concentration of at least 0.15. The Advice of Rights form states that, under that circumstance, \u201c[y]ou will be ineligible for modification of the suspension or issuance of a restrictive license, unless you participate in the Ignition Interlock System Program[.]\u201d (Emphasis added). By using the word \u201cunless,\u201d the Advice of Rights form makes clear that, if the driver takes an alcohol concentration test that indicates an alcohol concentration of at least 0.15, then participation in the Ignition Interlock System Program is necessary for eligibility for a restrictive license. But participation in the Ignition Interlock System Program alone is not sufficient for eligibility for a restrictive license. The plain language of the Advice of Rights form notifies a driver that \u201c[a] suspension may be modified or a restrictive license issued at a hearing in certain circumstances.\u201d In other words, after taking an alcohol concentration test with a result of 0.15 or higher, participation in the Ignition Interlock System Program is a prerequisite, but not the only prerequisite, for eligibility for a restrictive license. The other prerequisites are the \u201ccertain circumstances\u201d that are mentioned in the sentence directly preceding the advisement about the Ignition Interlock System Program in the Advice of Rights form and that are applicable where the test result is at least 0.08 but less than 0.15. And, as noted above, one such prerequisite for eligibility for a restrictive license is that the driver holds a non-commercial driver\u2019s license. <em>See </em>TR \u00a7 16-205.1(f)(8)(vii); COMAR 11.11.12.07A. It would be illogical, indeed, that a driver would fail an alcohol concentration test with a result of 0.15 or higher and not be subject to the same prerequisites as prescribed for drivers who attain a test result of 0.08 to less than 0.15. Thus, contrary to Seenath\u2019s position, the Advice of Rights form does not indicate that a holder of a commercial driver\u2019s license who failed an alcohol concentration test may obtain a restrictive <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"191\">*191</page-number>commercial driver\u2019s license merely by participating in the Ignition Interlock System Program.</p>\n<p id=\"b223-5\">Our holding is supported by this Court\u2019s precedent, which confirms that the Advice of Rights form need not inform a detained driver of every possible enticement for taking an alcohol concentration test and by analogy of every single possible permutation of the consequences of either failing or refusing to take an alcohol concentration test. <em>See Hare, </em>326 Md. at 304, 604 A.2d at 918 (\u201cA driver need not be told of every conceivable incentive for taking\u201d an alcohol concentration test.). Indeed, it is doubtful that the Advice of Rights form even could do so. The Advice of Rights form\u2019s purpose is to assist law enforcement officers with making the advisements that TR \u00a7 16-205.1(b) requires \u2014 specifically, advisements about certain consequences of either failing or refusing to take an alcohol concentration test. <em>See Hill, </em>415 Md. at 236-37, 999 A.2d at 1022 (\u201c[The Advice of Rights form] was designed by the MVA to explain to persons detained under [TR \u00a7] 16-205.1 that they have the right to refuse an alcohol concentration test, as well as to explain the potential sanctions that could arise from either taking and \u2018failing\u2019 the [alcohol concentration] test (i.e., showing a systemic alcohol concentration of 0.08 percent or greater) or refusing to take the [alcohol concentration] test at all.\u201d). TR \u00a7 16-205.1(b) requires several advisements, so the Advice of Rights form is several paragraphs long. At a certain point, adding advisements to the Advice of Rights form would diminish the Advice of Rights form\u2019s effectiveness and increase the risk of confusion by inundating detained drivers with information that may or may not be applicable to a particular detained driver. Moreover, the availability of access to a restrictive license is an incentive to consent to take an alcohol concentration test, rather than a sanction or negative consequence. TR \u00a7 16-205.1(b) does not require that a driver be advised of the availability of incentives to consent to take an alcohol concentration test. By contrast, TR \u00a7 16-205.1(b) does require under certain circumstances that a driver be advised of his or her ineligibility for incentives. <em>See </em>TR \u00a7 16-205.1(b)(2)(iv) (\u201c[I]f a police officer stops <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"192\">*192</page-number>or detains any person who the police officer has reasonable grounds to believe is or has been driving or attempting to drive a motor vehicle while under the influence of alcohol, ... and who is not unconscious or otherwise incapable of refusing to take a test, the police officer shall: ...

Despite TR \u00a7 16-205.1 's declaration of implied consent by all drivers, TR \u00a7 16-205.1 recognizes that a driver detained by a law enforcement officer may refuse to take the [alcohol concentration] test.

In addition to rejecting the driver\u2019s contention that the Advice of Rights form was misleading, this Court rejected the driver\u2019s contention that the Advice of Rights form was inconsistent with TR \u00a7 16-205. l\u2019s legislative history, which, according to the driver, indicated that the <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"181\">*181</page-number>General Assembly had intended to require a law enforcement officer to inform a driver that, if the driver refused to take an alcohol concentration test, the MVA would disqualify the driver from driving a commercial motor vehicle for 1 year, regardless of whether the driver participated in the Ignition Interlock System Program. <em>See Hill, </em>415 Md. at 246-47, 999 A.2d at 1028.</p>\n</footnote>\n<footnote label=\"14\">\n<p id=\"b213-8\">. Here, the subject of the constitutional challenge is not a statute, but instead a practice \u2014 namely, the advisement of rights and consequences in the Advice of Rights form.

Accordingly, due process required that the Advice Rights form include notice of these sanctions, and that any information provided not be \u201cmisleading or inaccurate.\u201d <em>See </em>Md.Code (1977, Repl.Vol.2012, 2015 Supp.), \u00a7 16 \u2014 205.1(b)(2)(iii) and (b)(2)(iv) of the Transportation Article (\u201cTR\u201d) (noting that \u201cthe police officer shall ...

Under the heading \u201cSuspension of Your Maryland Driver\u2019s License or Driving Privilege\u201d, the Advice of Rights form provided:</p>\n<blockquote id=\"b226-5\">The following periods of suspension shall be imposed against your license or privilege to drive in Maryland: If your test result is an alcohol concentration of at least 0.08 but less than 0.15: The suspension will be 45 days for a first offense and 90 days for a second or subsequent offense.</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b226-6\">If your test result is an alcohol concentration of 0.15 or more: The suspension will be 90 days for a first offense and 180 days for a second or subsequent offense.</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b226-7\">If you refuse to submit to a test: The suspension will be 120 days for a first offense and one (1) year for a second or subsequent offense. An additional criminal penalty of not more than $500 or imprisonment for not more than 2 months!,] or both, may be imposed under [TR] \u00a7 27-101(x) [ ] if you are convicted of a drunk or drugged driving offense <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"195\">*195</page-number>under [TR] \u00a7 21-902, and the judge or jury finds beyond a reasonable doubt that you knowingly refused to take a test arising out of the same eircumstances[.] <em>If you hold a commercial driver\u2019s license [] and were driving a noncommercial motor vehicle ivhen you were stopped, and refuse to submit to a test, your [commercial driver\u2019s license] or privilege will be disqualified for one (1) year for a first ojfense[J or for life if your [commercial driver\u2019s license] or privilege has been previously disqualified for at least one (1) year under [TR] \u00a7 16-812(a) or (b) [], a federal law, or any other [S]tate\u2019s law[] If you were driving a commercial motor vehicle and refuse the test, your [commercial driver\u2019s license] or privilege will be disqualified as set forth below[.]</em></blockquote>\n<p id=\"b227-5\">(emphasis omitted) (emphasis added). The phrase, \u201c[t]he following periods of <em>suspension </em>shall be imposed against your <em>license ... </em>[,]\u201d could be perceived as encompassing only noncommercial driving privileges, (emphasis added). This is because the Advice of Rights form, when describing the sanction for refusal to take an alcohol concentration test, lists the suspension that shall be imposed on a driver\u2019s license, and also references a one-year \u201cdisqualification\u201d of a \u201ccommercial driver\u2019s license\u201d or \u201cCDL.\u201d The inclusion of the terms \u201cCDL\u201d and \u201cdisqualification\u201d, as distinguished from \u201clicense\u201d and \u201csuspension\u201d elsewhere in the form, gives the impression that a \u201csuspension\u201d of the driver\u2019s \u201clicense\u201d is not as all-encompassing as the majority would suggest. Thus, the description of the sanctions for taking and failing an alcohol concentration test, which only pertain to the driver\u2019s \u201clicense\u201d, did not provide notice of the mandatory sanctions affecting the driver\u2019s commercial license.</p>\n<p id=\"b227-6\">This Court\u2019s opinion in <em>Hill, </em>where we held that the Advice of Rights form did not mislead a driver that the disqualification of his CDL could be modified through participation in the ignition interlock program, is instructive. 415 Md. at 248, 999 A.2d at 1028. In that case, we noted, <em>inter alia, </em>that the section of the form under the heading \u201cModification of the Suspension or Issuance of a Restrictive License\u201d did not <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"196\">*196</page-number>\u201cmention a CDL or commercial driving privileges[,]\u201d so the Advice of Rights form did not mislead Mr. Hill or \u201cincompletely advise [him] of the applicable sanctions[.]\u201d <em>Id. </em>at 246, 999 A.2d at 1027-28. Our reasoning in <em>Hill </em>\u2014 indicating that commercial driving privileges are only at issue where the form makes specific mention of a commercial driver\u2019s license\u2014 should apply to all sections of the Advice of Rights form. Therefore, if the section of the form concerning modifications did not pertain to commercial driving privileges because the term \u201cCDL\u201d was missing in <em>Hill, </em>then the section of the form discussing suspensions, which also omits the term \u201cCDL,\u201d should be interpreted similarly in the case at bar.</p>\n<p id=\"b228-5\">I agree with the majority that it would be inconsistent with the protection of the public, \u201cif a holder of a commercial driver\u2019s license failed ... an alcohol concentration test and ... remained able to drive commercial vehicles.\u201d Maj. Op. at 187, 136 A.3d at 910. However, we are not tasked with interpreting the Advice of Rights form in a way that will best serve the public good, and we should not expect a driver detained on suspicion of drunk or drugged driving to contemplate the meaning of the form in such a public-spirited manner. The plain language of the Advice of Rights form leads a driver to believe that his or her commercial driving privileges would be unaffected by the failure of an alcohol concentration test. I would therefore affirm the decision of the circuit court.</p>\n</opinion>\n</casebody>\n",
