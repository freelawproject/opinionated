The Commissioner of Financial Regulation of the Department of Labor, Licensing, and Regulation (\u201cthe Commissioner\u201d)<footnotemark>2</footnotemark> brought an administrative enforcement action against Petitioners, CashCall, Inc. (\u201cCashCall\u201d), a California corporation, and John Paul Reddam (\u201cReddam\u201d), the corporation\u2019s president and owner, for violating various Maryland consumer protection laws, including the MCSBA. Petitioners disagreed that their business activities <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"416\">*416</page-number>fell within the purview of the MCSBA, claiming that our holding in <em>Gomez v. Jackson Hewitt, Inc., </em>427 Md. 128, 46 A.3d 443 (2012) established a broad \u201cdirect payment\u201d requirement within the MCSBA\u2019s definition of a credit services business. We shall clarify the holding in <em>Gomez v. Jackson Hewitt, Inc., </em>427 Md. at 128, 46 A.3d at 443 by limiting its discussion of a \u201cdirect payment\u201d requirement to the circumstances of that case. For the reasons explained below, we hold that the definition of a credit services business does not contain a broad direct payment requirement.</p>\n<p id=\"b448-4\">FACTUAL AND PROCEDURAL BACKGROUND</p>\n<p id=\"b448-5\">A person or entity engaged in providing credit services business is subject to regulation under Maryland law. Under CL \u00a7 14-1901(e),</p>\n<blockquote id=\"b448-6\">(1) \u201cCredit services business\u201d means any person who, with respect to the extension of credit by others, sells, provides, or performs, or represents that such person can or will sell, provide, or perform, any of the following services in return for the payment of money or other valuable consideration:</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b448-7\">(i) Improving a consumer\u2019s credit record, history, or rating or establishing a new credit file or record;</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b448-8\">(ii) Obtaining an extension of credit<footnotemark>3</footnotemark> for a consumer; or</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b448-9\">(iii) Providing advice or assistance to a consumer with regard to either subparagraph (i) or (ii) of this paragraph.</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b448-10\">(2) \u201cCredit services business\u201d includes a person who sells or attempts to sell written materials containing information that the person represents will enable a consumer to establish a new credit file or record.<footnotemark>4</footnotemark></blockquote>\n<p id=\"b449-3\"><page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"417\">*417</page-number>Under CL and FI, a credit services business must comply with various requirements imposed by statute. Most relevant to this case is the requirement that a credit services business is prohibited from assisting \u201ca consumer to obtain an extension of credit at a rate of interest which, except for federal preemption of State law\u201d would exceed the maximum annual percentage rates under Maryland Law.<footnotemark>5</footnotemark> CL \u00a7 14-1902(9). <em>See </em>CL \u00a7 12-102. Although federal law<footnotemark>6</footnotemark> allows federally <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"418\">*418</page-number>insured banks to charge out-of-state consumers the same interest rate permitted by the bank\u2019s home state, regardless of the interest rate caps imposed by the law of the consumer\u2019s resident state, \u201ca credit services business may not, under the MCSBA, assist a consumer in obtaining a loan, from any instate or out-of-state bank, at an interest rate prohibited by Maryland law.\u201d <em>Maryland Comm\u2019r of Fin. Regulation v. CashCall, Inc., 225 </em>Md.App. 313, 325, 124 A.3d 670, 677 (2015).</p>\n<p id=\"b450-4\">CashCall\u2019s Business Activities</p>\n<p id=\"b450-5\">CashCall marketed high-interest loans to consumers through television and internet advertisements. The advertisements contained information regarding CashCall\u2019s website and telephone number. CashCall offered loans to consumers at three different interest rates: 59%, 89%, or 96%.<footnotemark>7</footnotemark> These interest rates greatly exceeded the interest rates permitted by Maryland law, which caps the interest rate at 33% on all loans below $6,000.<footnotemark>8</footnotemark> Between January 2006 and December 2010, through CashCall, Maryland consumers received 5,651 loans in amounts less than $6,000 with interest rates greater than 33%.</p>\n<p id=\"b450-6\">Maryland consumers who visited the CashCall website or called CashCall directly were directed to fill out an online loan application though CashCall\u2019s website. CashCall then forwarded the completed application to a federally insured out-of-state bank that is exempt from Maryland\u2019s usury laws. Once a bank approved a loan application, the bank would place, in the consumer\u2019s bank account, the requested loan amount less a $75 fee designated as an \u201corigination fee.\u201d<footnotemark>9</footnotemark> The following example is illustrative of a typical transaction: In the case of a $2,600 approved loan, the consumer receives $2,525, which is the principal amount owed on the loan less the $75 origination fee. The consumer is required to pay the holder of the loan <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"419\">*419</page-number>$2,600, plus interest. In other words, \u201cthe consumer ultimately pa[ys] the origination fee as he or she repa[ys] the loan in monthly installments to whomever [holds] the loan.\u201d <em>CashCall, Inc., 225 </em>Md.App. at 318, 124 A.3d at 673.</p>\n<p id=\"b451-4\">Specifically, CashCall had entered into partnerships with First Bank <em>&amp; </em>Trust, a South Dakota-chartered bank and First Bank of Delaware, a Delaware-chartered bank. Pursuant to contracts between CashCall and each bank, CashCall was required to purchase a loan three days after<footnotemark>10</footnotemark> the loan was originated and the funds dispersed to the consumer.<footnotemark>11</footnotemark> Cash-Call paid the bank the full value of the loan, i.e., the $2,600 from the example above, plus the three days of interest that had accrued on the loan. The banks also paid CashCall a \u201croyalty\u201d fee of $5 to $72.22 per loan depending on the amount of the loan and the bank that disbursed the funds. Upon CashCall\u2019s purchase of the loan, all of the bank\u2019s rights and interests in the loan were assigned, without recourse, to CashCall. This gave CashCall the right to enforce the terms provided in the loan documents, including the right to collect payments of the principal, interest and other fees.<footnotemark>12</footnotemark> In fact, if the bank mistakenly received a payment from a consumer on a <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"420\">*420</page-number>loan CashCall purchased, the bank was required to hold the payment \u201cin trust\u201d and forward the payment to CashCall no later than the following business day.</p>\n<p id=\"b452-4\">Given the nature of the partnership between CashCall and the banks, Maryland consumers who obtained loans through CashCall dealt primarily with CashCall. A consumer\u2019s contact with the bank was limited to a single transaction: the bank\u2019s deposit of money into the consumer\u2019s bank account. Maryland consumers communicated with CashCall, and made all loan payments whether it be for principal, interest, or any other fees directly to CashCall.</p>\n<p id=\"b452-5\">The Enforcement Action</p>\n<p id=\"b452-6\">Between 2007 and 2011, eighteen Maryland residents filed complaints with the Commissioner. Based on these complaints, the Commissioner initiated an investigation into the business practices of CashCall and Reddam.<footnotemark>13</footnotemark> On June 23, 2009, in a \u201cSummary Order to Cease and Desist,\u201d<footnotemark>14</footnotemark> the <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"421\">*421</page-number>Commissioner found that \u201c[Petitioners] engaged in illegal and predatory business activities which directly resulted in Maryland consumers obtaining usurious loans from national banks\u201d in violation of the MCSBA. In response, on July 7, 2009, Petitioners requested a hearing in the Office of Administrative Hearings (\u201cOAH\u201d).</p>\n<p id=\"b453-4\">On September 14, 2010, administrative law judge (\u201cALJ\u201d) Nancy E. Paige held a hearing on the Summary Order. In ALJ Paige\u2019s December 2, 2010 \u201cProposed Decision,\u201d she concluded that Petitioners violated the MCSBA and the licensing provisions of the Maryland Consumer Loan Law.<footnotemark>15</footnotemark> Characterizing each of the 5,651 loans Petitioners offered to a Maryland consumer as a first offense, ALJ Paige proposed a penalty of $1,000 for each loan, for a total civil penalty of $5,651,000. ALJ Paige further recommended that the Commissioner \u201c[e]nter a final Order that [Petitioners] cease and desist from engaging in the \u2018credit services businessf ]\u2019 \u201d and ordered CashCall to pay the full civil penalty of $5,651,000. Petitioners filed exceptions to the ALJ Paige\u2019s \u201cProposed Order\u201d on January 20, 2011. The parties agreed to stay the matter pending the outcome of a case for which we had granted <em>certiorari </em>on October 24, 2011, <em>Gomez v. Jackson Hewitt, Inc., </em><page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"422\">*422</page-number>422 Md. 352, 30 A.3d 193 (2011) This Court issued its opinion in <em>Gomez, </em>427 Md. at 128, 46 A.3d at 443 on June 22, 2012.</p>\n<p id=\"b454-4\">In the aftermath of <em>Gomez, </em>Commissioner Mark Kaufman held a hearing on the exceptions filed in this case on August 10, 2012 and issued an \u201cOpinion and Final Order\u201d (\u201cFinal Order\u201d) on November 8, 2012. In his Final Order, Commissioner Kaufman explained that the representative promissory note and disclosure statement ALJ Paige admitted into evidence demonstrates how consumers made payments directly to CashCall:</p>\n<blockquote id=\"b454-5\">[Petitioners\u2019] Exhibit # 1 (admitted in the OAH hearing) is the First Bank &amp; Trust Promissory Note and Disclosure Statement, dated as of December 12, 2006 (the \u201cPromissory Note\u201d) for a $2,600 consumer loan. The \u201cfinanced\u201d amount of the loan is shown as $2,525.00. This is the amount received by the consumer. A \u201cPrepaid Finance Charge/Origination Fee\u201d is listed at $75.00. The $75.00 fee is rolled into the principal amount of the loan. As a result, the total amount of principal due from the consumer is $2,600.00.</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b454-6\">In order to understand the significance of the $75 fee, one must turn back to the Sealed Agreements [contracts between CashCall and the bank].... [W]hen CashCall purchased a loan, CashCall paid for the outstanding balance due, including all principal, interest origination fees, and other charges or sums owed by the borrower. In other words, CashCall paid $2,600 for the loan. Because the loan was transferred from the bank to CashCall three days later, the consumer did not make a single payment to the bank.... The consumer, however, directly paid CashCall, not the bank, because CashCall collected on the loan, which included the $75.00.</blockquote>\n<p id=\"b454-7\">(footnote omitted).</p>\n<p id=\"b454-8\">Moreover, Commissioner Kaufman rejected Petitioner\u2019s argument that <em>Gomez, </em>427 Md. at 128, 46 A.3d at 443 applied to the Petitioners\u2019 case. He distinguished <em>Gomez </em>factually:</p>\n<blockquote id=\"b455-3\"><page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"423\">*423</page-number>In <em>Gomez, </em>the fees to Jackson Hewitt for <em>tax preparation </em>were rolled into the principal amount of the loan <em>and </em>the lending bank, not Jackson Hewitt, collected on the loan. The lending bank then paid Jackson Hewitt, resulting in no direct payment by the consumer to Jackson Hewitt. Here, the consumer paid CashCall for the principal, interest, and <em>fees </em>on the loan.</blockquote>\n<p id=\"b455-4\">(emphasis in original). Commissioner Kaufman also conducted an analysis of <em>Gomez </em>and concluded that <em>\u201cGomez </em>applies to tax preparers who were marketing refund anticipation loans in the context of tax preparation services.\u201d He explained:</p>\n<blockquote id=\"b455-5\">One of the concerns of the Court of Appeals was that allowing indirect payment to trigger the application the MCSBA in the context of refund anticipation loans could lead to \u201cthe absurd results in applying the statute to tremendous numbers o'f retailers throughout Maryland who have never registered under the [M]CSBA.\u201d <em>Gomez, </em>427 Md. at 138 [46 A.3d 443]. Specifically, the Court was concerned that \u201cdepartment stores, electronic retailers, big box retailers, bookstores, gas stations[, and] clothing retailers\u201d would be subject to the MCSBA when assisting consumers in applying for credit offered by third-party banks. <em>Gomez, </em>427 Md. at 159 [46 A.3d 443]. The Court was clearly focused on the fact that the extension of credit was related to the services of the facilitator of the loan, <em>but </em>the primary commercial and contractual relationship between Ms. Gomez and Jackson Hewitt was related to tax preparation, not obtaining an extension of credit. The extension of credit was merely collateral to Jackson Hewitt\u2019s primary service of preparing tax returns. On the other hand, Cash-Call\u2019s solicitation, website applications, support services and assistance to consumers, and processing all zeroed in on obtaining a loan for a consumer. The record in this matter contains no evidence that CashCall provided any other services to the consumers. Application of the MCSBA to CashCall in this context creates no risk that department <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"424\">*424</page-number>stores, retailers, or gas stations could be swept within the scope of the MCSBA.</blockquote>\n<p id=\"b456-5\">(alterations and emphasis in original). Commissioner Kaufman also emphasized this Court\u2019s detailed analysis of the legislative history of the MCSBA. After recounting the legislative history of the MCSBA, as discussed in <em>Gomez, </em>he concluded that \u201ca \u2018marketer\u2019 of loans for out-of state banks who receives an indirect payment from a consumer for providing services to facilitate a high-interest, small-dollar consumer loan is subject to the MCSBA and the Commissioner\u2019s jurisdiction to enforce the MCSBA.\u201d Thus, he ordered that Petitioners \u201ccease and desist from engaging in the \u2018credit services business[ ]\u2019 \u201d and pay to the Commissioner \u201ca civil penalty of $5,651,000.00 within 30 days.\u201d</p>\n<p id=\"b456-6\">On December 7, 2012, CashCall filed a timely petition for judicial review of the Final Order and a motion to stay the Final Order in the Circuit Court for Baltimore City. Reddam did not file a petition for judicial review at that time. On April 11, 2013, however, CashCall and Reddam filed an amended petition for judicial review solely for the purpose of adding Reddam as a petitioner. The Circuit Court dismissed the amended petition for judicial review as untimely, eliminating Reddam as a party to the judicial review proceeding. Despite noting that CashCall may be \u201ca predatory entity preying on the consumers of Maryland and has developed a scheme to evade the usory [sic] laws of Maryland,\u201d the Circuit Court reversed the Final Order on July 3, 2013. In its \u201cMemorandum and Order,\u201d it explained that the <em>Gomez </em>decision requires a direct payment between a business and a consumer under the MCSBA. Therefore, it concluded that CashCall was not a \u201ccredit services business\u201d under the MCSBA. The Circuit Court further issued a <em>\u201cNun Pro Tunc </em>Order\u201d to clarify that its reversal of the Final Order applied only to CashCall and not Reddam because Reddam was not a party to the judicial review proceeding. As a result, the Final Order against Reddam was intact and enforceable against him.</p>\n<p id=\"b456-7\">On September 18, 2013, the Commissioner filed a Notice of <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"425\">*425</page-number>Appeal to the Court of Special Appeals.<footnotemark>16</footnotemark> The intermediate appellate court conducted a comprehensive review of this Court\u2019s decision in <em>Gomez </em>and of the MCSBA, including its legislative history. In a reported opinion, <em>Maryland Comm\u2019r of Fin. Regulation v. CashCall, Inc., </em>225 Md.App. 313, 124 A.3d 670 (2015), the Court of Special Appeals affirmed the Final Order. We granted <em>certiorari, CashCall, Inc. v. Comm\u2019r of Fin. Regulation, </em>445 Md. 487, 128 A.3d 51 (2015), to answer the following questions, which we have consolidated and rephrased:<footnotemark>17</footnotemark></p>\n<blockquote id=\"b457-4\">Does the MCSBA\u2019s definition of a \u201ccredit services business\u201d require there to be a direct payment from a consumer to an entity whose primary business is to market, facilitate, and ultimately acquire the loans it arranged?</blockquote>\n<p id=\"b457-5\">For the reasons stated below, we shall answer this question in the negative. Accordingly, the judgment of the Court of Special Appeals is affirmed.</p>\n<p id=\"b457-6\">STANDARD OF REVIEW</p>\n<p id=\"b457-7\">Review of most administrative agency decisions, such as the present one, is governed by the Maryland Admin<page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"426\">*426</page-number>istrative Procedure Act, Md. Code (1984, 2014 Repl. Vol.), \u00a7 10-222 of the State Government Article. <em>Bayly Crossing, LLC v. Consumer Prot. Div., Office of Atty. Gen., </em>417 Md. 128, 136, 9 A.3d 4, 8-9 (2010). In an appeal from the judicial review of an administrative agency\u2019s decision, \u201cwe look through the decisions of the circuit courts and intermediate appellate court, and evaluate the agency decision directly.\u201d <em>W.R. Grace &amp; Co. v. Swedo, </em>439 Md. 441, 452-53, 96 A.3d 210, 217 (2014). When a party challenges how an agency applied, as opposed to interpreted, a statute, the party raises a mixed question of law and fact. <em>Bayly Crossing, LLC, </em>417 Md. at 138, 9 A.3d at 10. \u201cWe [] apply the substantial evidence standard when reviewing mixed questions of law and fact.\u201d <em>Consumer Prot. Div. v. Morgan, </em>387 Md. 125, 160, 874 A.2d 919, 939 (2005). The standard for substantial evidence review is \u201cwhether a reasoning mind reasonably could have reached the factual conclusion the agency reached.\u201d <em>Christopher v.

Distinguishing the case <em>sub judice </em>from <em>Gomez, </em>the Commissioner counters that the direct payment requirement discussed in <em>Gomez </em>does not apply to companies like CashCall, whose sole business is to arrange loans for consumers. We agree and provide clarity as to the meaning of what constitutes a \u201ccredit services business\u201d under the MCSBA.</p>\n<p id=\"b458-7\">\n<em>Gomez v. Jackson Hewitt</em>\n</p>\n<p id=\"b458-8\">In <em>Gomez v. Jackson Hewitt, </em>we were called upon to decide whether the MCSBA applied to \u201ca tax preparer who receives payment from a lending bank for \u2018facilitating\u2019 a consumer\u2019s <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"427\">*427</page-number>obtention of a refund anticipation loan (\u201cRAL\u201d),<footnotemark>18</footnotemark> where the tax preparer receives no direct payment from the consumer for this service^]\u201d 427 Md. at 133, 46 A.3d at 446. In <em>Gomez, </em>Jackson Hewitt, a provider of tax preparation services, had an agreement with a lender, Santa Barbara Bank &amp; Trust (\u201cSBBT\u201d). 427 Md. at 134, 46 A.3d at 447. Pursuant to this agreement, SSBT would \u201coffer, process, and administer certain financial products, including RALs\u201d to Jackson Hewitt customers. <em>Id. </em>Jackson Hewitt facilitated these loans by informing its customers of the availability of a RAL and providing a loan application developed by SBBT. <em>Gomez, </em>427 Md. at 135, 46 A.3d at 448. Under the program agreement, SBBT paid Jackson Hewitt a fixed annual fee as well as \u201cvariable payments tied to growth in the SBBT program.\u201d <em>Gomez, </em>427 Md. at 135, 46 A.3d at 447.</p>\n<p id=\"b459-4\">Alicia Gomez alleged violations of the MCSBA after Jackson Hewitt prepared her federal income tax return and helped her obtain a RAL through the SBBT program. <em>Gomez, </em>427 Md. at 133-34, 46 A.3d at 447.<footnotemark>19</footnotemark> Before this Court, Ms. Gomez, the Commissioner, and the Consumer Protection Division of the Office of the Maryland Attorney General<footnotemark>20</footnotemark> argued that the \u201cplain language of the [M]CSBA and its legislative history\u201d supported the MCSBA\u2019s application to Jackson Hewitt. <em>Gomez, </em>427 Md. at 142, 46 A.3d at 452. Jackson Hewitt disagreed, arguing that it did not qualify as a credit services business because it was not paid directly by the consumer. <em>Gomez, </em>427 Md. at 147, 46 A.3d at 454.</p>\n<p id=\"b460-3\"><page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"428\">*428</page-number>This Court agreed with Jackson Hewitt, concluding that Jackson Hewitt was not a credit services business and therefore, not subject to the requirements of the MCSBA. <em>Gomez, </em>427 Md. at 178, 46 A.3d at 473. We explained:</p>\n<blockquote id=\"b460-4\">In the context of the [MjCSBA and \u00a7 14-1901(e), \u201cin return\u201d can reasonably be understood to envision an exchange of assistance for payment between the consumer and the provider of that assistance and to mean that any payment to the credit services business for such assistance in obtaining the extension of credit must come <em>directly </em>from <em>the consumer.</em></blockquote>\n<p id=\"b460-5\"><em>Gomez, </em>427 Md. at 154, 46 A.3d at 459 (emphasis in original). This Court also conducted an extensive analysis of the legislative history of the MCSBA and the General Assembly\u2019s enactment of RAL legislation in 2010 to confirm that \u201cthe most logical reading of the [MjCSBA as a whole is that it was not intended to regulate RAL facilitators who do not receive compensation directly from the consumer.\u201d <em>Gomez, </em>427 Md. at 159, 46 A.3d at 462. The Court of Special Appeals appropriately recognized that</p>\n<blockquote id=\"b460-6\">in rendering its decision in <em>Gomez, </em>[the Court of Appeals] did not intend to establish a universal rule, and that the \u201cdirect payment\u201d requirement was not meant to apply to a company, like CashCall, which is exclusively engaged in assisting Maryland consumers to obtain small loans bearing annual interest rates that would be, under Maryland law, usurious and then, to further profit from this activity, immediately purchases the loans after their issuance and thereafter collects all payments due on the loans from the consumer, including the \u201crolled in\u201d origination fee.</blockquote>\n<p id=\"b460-7\"><em>CashCall, Inc., </em>225 Md.App. at 330-31, 124 A.3d at 680. We agree and now make it clear that the \u201cdirect payment\u201d requirement as set forth in <em>Gomez </em>is limited to the circumstances before the Court in that case, i.e., \u201ca tax preparer who receives payment from a lending bank for \u2018facilitating\u2019 a consumer\u2019s obtention of a [RAL].\u201d <em>Gomez, </em>427 Md. at 133, 46 A.3d at 446.</p>\n<p id=\"b461-3\"><page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"429\">*429</page-number>Chief Judge Krauser noted, as did Commissioner Kaufman in his Final Order, that in <em>Gomez, </em>we were \u201casked to address a set of facts quite different from those presently before us.\u201d <em>CashCall, Inc., </em>225 Md.App. at 331, 124 A.3d at 680. \u201cThe facts in <em>Gomez </em>established that there were, in the Commissioner\u2019s words, \u2018two separate commercial relationships\u2019 between Ms. Gomez and Jackson Hewitt: one relationship for tax preparation purposes and the other for facilitating the RAL.\u201d <em>Id. </em>In his Final Order, Commissioner Kaufman astutely recognized that \u201cthe primary commercial and contractual relationship between Ms. Gomez and Jackson Hewitt was related to tax preparation, not obtaining an extension of credit\u201d and that \u201c[t]he extension of credit was merely collateral to Jackson Hewitt\u2019s primary service of preparing tax returns.\u201d In contrast, CashCall\u2019s business model revolves around the benefits it inures from purchasing and collecting principal, interest and all other fees on the very loans it assisted consumers in obtaining.</p>\n<p id=\"b461-4\">Ms. Gomez\u2019s allegation in her complaint that she \u201c <em>\u2018indirectly </em>\u2019 paid [Jackson Hewitt] for arranging the RAL\u201d zones in on the annual fee SSBT paid to Jackson Hewitt for participation in the SBBT program. <em>Gomez, </em>427 Md. at 137, 46 A.3d at 448-49 (emphasis in original, footnote omitted). Ms. Gomez obtained a loan in the amount of $2,323. This amount was composed of the following:</p>\n<blockquote id=\"b461-5\">$1,950.97 as the \u201c[a]mount paid directly to [Ms. Gomez];\u201d</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"AIS\">$284.00 as the \u201c[t]ax preparation fees paid to\u201d [Jackson Hewitt];</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b461-6\">$29.95 as the \u201cSBBT tax refund account handing fee;\u201d and $58.08 as the \u201ctotal prepaid finance charge (SBBT bank fee).\u201d</blockquote>\n<p id=\"b461-7\"><em>Gomez, </em>427 Md. at 136, 46 A.3d at 448 (emphasis added). As a result, the payment for Jackson Hewitt\u2019s role in \u201cproviding advice or assistance to a consumer with regard to ... [obtaining an extension of credit for a consumer\u201d was characterized as \u201cindirect\u201d because Ms. Gomez contended that SSBT used the income from the $88.03 in fees it charged her to pay <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"430\">*430</page-number>Jackson Hewitt the fixed annual fee and payments tied to growth under the SBBT program. CL \u00a7 14-1901(e). See <em>Gomez, </em>427 Md. at 137, n. 12, 46 A.3d at 449, n. 12.</p>\n<p id=\"b462-4\">It is evident that the $284 amount SBBT paid to Jackson Hewitt was the amount Ms. Gomez owed Jackson Hewitt for tax preparation services. The lending bank paid Jackson Hewitt separately, from its own funds, for Jackson Hewitt\u2019s role in facilitating the RAL. To surmise, as Ms. Gomez did, that the lending bank categorically paid Jackson Hewitt for its RAL facilitation role out of the exact income it obtained from the consumer through the SBBT program, rather than income it obtained elsewhere through business activities unrelated to the SBBT program is, at best, conjecture. Thus, the link between the fees paid by Ms. Gomez to SBBT as the \u201cSBBT tax refund account handling fee\u201d and the \u201ctotal prepaid finance charge (SBBT bank fee),\u201d and the independent payments SBBT made to Jackson Hewitt as part of the SBBT program is tenuous. <em>Gomez, </em>427 Md. at 136, 46 A.3d at 448. Based on this particular scenario, this Court recognized that Ms. Gomez\u2019s \u201cinterpretation of the [M]CSBA would lead to absurd results in applying the statute to tremendous numbers of retailers throughout Maryland who have never registered under the [MjCSBA.\u201d <em>Gomez, </em>427 Md. at 138, 46 A.3d at 449. Concluding that a \u201cdirect payment\u201d requirement existed was appropriate under those circumstances to allay that concern.</p>\n<p id=\"b462-5\">That concern does not exist in the case <em>sub judice. </em>The Final Order distinguishes the instant case from <em>Gomez: </em>\u201cIn <em>Gomez, </em>the fees to Jackson Hewitt for <em>tax preparation </em>were rolled into the principal amount of the loan <em>and </em>the lending bank, not Jackson Hewitt, collected on the loan.\u201d (emphasis in original). Furthermore, \u201cCashCall\u2019s solicitation, website applications, support services and assistance to consumers, and processing all zeroed in on obtaining a loan for a consumer. The record in this matter contains no evidence that CashCall provided any other services to the consumers.\u201d The Final Order also indicated that the \u201c[ajpplication of the MCSBA to CashCall in this context creates no risk that department <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"431\">*431</page-number>stores, retailers, or gas stations could be swept within the scope of the MCSBA.\u201d</p>\n<p id=\"b463-4\">Limiting the \u201cdirect payment\u201d requirement to the facts of <em>Gomez </em>also comports with the principals of statutory construction:</p>\n<blockquote id=\"b463-5\">The cardinal rule of statutory interpretation is to ascertain and effectuate the real and actual intent of the Legislature. A court\u2019s primary goal in interpreting statutory language is to discern the legislative purpose, the ends to be accomplished, or the evils to be remedied by the statutory provision under scrutiny.</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b463-6\">To ascertain the intent of the General Assembly, we begin with the normal, plain meaning of the statute. If the language of the statute is unambiguous and clearly consistent with the statute\u2019s apparent purpose, our inquiry as to the legislative intent ends ordinarily and we apply the statute as written without resort to other rules of construction. We neither add nor delete language so as to reflect an intent not evidenced in the plain and unambiguous language of the statute, and we do not construe a statute with forced or subtle interpretations that limit or extend its application. We, however, do not read statutory language in a vacuum, nor do we confine strictly our interpretation of a statute\u2019s plain language to the isolated section alone. Rather, the plain language must be viewed within the context of the statutory scheme to which it belongs, considering the purpose, aim, or policy of the Legislature in enacting the statute. We presume that the Legislature intends its enactments to operate together as a consistent and harmonious body of law, and, thus, we seek to reconcile and harmonize the parts of a statute, to the extent possible consistent with the statute\u2019s object and scope....</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b463-7\">In every case, the statute must be given a reasonable interpretation, not one that is absurd, illogical or incompatible with common sense.</blockquote>\n<p id=\"b463-8\"><em>Gardner v.

Proceeding on the assumption that Jackson Hewitt provided \u201cadvice or assistance to a consumer with regard to ... [obtaining an extension of credit for a consumer,\u201d this Court noted in <em>Gomez </em>that \u201cto be subject to the [MjCSBA, [ ] \u2018advice or assistance\u2019 must be provided <em>\u2018in return </em>for the payment of money or other valuable consideration[.]\u201d 427 Md. at 154, 46 A.3d at 459 (citing CL \u00a7 14-1901(e)) (emphasis in original). This Court then consulted the dictionary definition of \u201cin return.\u201d <em>Id. </em>Merriam Webster Collegiate Dictionary 1066 (11th ed. 2003) defines \u201cin return\u201d as \u201cin reciprocation, compensation, or repayment.\u201d Nothing in this definition requires that the \u201creciprocation, compensation, or repayment\u201d be made directly. <em>Id. </em>However, to read a broad \u201cdirect payment\u201d requirement into the statute \u201cadd[s] ... language so as to reflect an intent not evidenced in the plain and unambiguous language of the statute.\u201d <em>Woznicki v.

Thus, we agree with the Court of Special Appeals that this Court\u2019s decision in <em>Gomez </em>was not intended \u201cto apply beyond the factual boundaries of that case, and certainly it was not intended to extend to companies, like CashCall, whose \u2018sole purpose\u2019 is to arrange loans for Maryland consumers and thereby exclude the very businesses that the MCSBA was intended to cover.\u201d <em>CashCall, Inc., </em>225 Md.App. at 330, 124 A.3d at 680.</p>\n<p id=\"b464-4\">The Court\u2019s in-depth analysis in <em>Gomez </em>of the legislative history of the MCSBA, specifically the 2001, 2002, and 2010 amendments and the inception of the RAL legislation confirms our conclusion that the \u201cdirect payment\u201d requirement is limited to the facts of that case. 427 Md. at 159, 46 A.3d at 462 (\u201c[T]he most logical reading of the [MjCSBA as a whole is that it was not intended to regulate RAL facilitators who do not receive compensation directly from the consumer.\u201d). The MCSBA was enacted in 1987 with the inception of House Bill 472. <em>Id. </em>The \u201cSummary\u201d section of the House of Delegates Floor Report on House Bill 472 states that \u201c[tjhis bill created] a new subtitle to regulate credit services businesses <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"433\">*433</page-number>which accept fees for attempting to improve a consumer\u2019s credit record, history or rating, obtaining an extension of credit, <em>or </em>providing advice about either.\u201d <em>Gomez, </em>427 Md. at 161, n. 28, 46 A.3d at 463, n. 28 (alterations and emphasis in original).</p>\n<p id=\"b465-4\">In 2001, the MCSBA was amended through Senate Bill 882, which was <em>\u201cprimarily aimed at \u2018payday loans </em>\u2019<footnotemark>21</footnotemark> and particularly, third party arrangements that some federally-insured depository such as national banks and federal savings and loan associations, have entered into with local agents (usually a check cashing business) to broker such loans.\u201d <em>Gomez, </em>427 Md. at 164, 46 A.3d at 465 (emphasis in original). The very next year, the General Assembly again amended the MCSBA to provide broader protections to consumers by adding a prohibition against assisting \u201ca consumer to obtain an extension of unsecured closed end credit <em>or closed end credit secured by personal property </em>at a rate of interest which, except for federal preemption of State law, would be prohibited under Title 12, Subtitle 1, 3, or 10 of [the] [CL] article.\u201d <em>Gomez, </em>427 Md. at 166, 46 A.3d at 466 (emphasis in original). As a result, the 2002 amendment made the MCSBA applicable \u201cto <em>any </em>extension of credit.\u201d <em>Id. </em>(emphasis in original). The 2010 amendments to the MCSBA provided that a credit services business shall not \u201c[c]harge or receive any money or other valuable consideration in connection with an extension of credit that, when combined with any interest charged on the extension of credit, would exceed the interest rate permitted for the extension of credit under the applicable title of this article[.]\u201d <em>Gomez, </em>427 Md. at 167, 46 A.3d at 466. This amendment \u201cmerely clarifie[d] that all fees associated with a <em>payday loan </em>fall under the usury caps here in the State of Maryland.\u201d <em>Id. </em>(emphasis in original).</p>\n<p id=\"b465-5\">In 2010, the General Assembly also enacted legislation specifically to regulate RALs. <em>Gomez, </em>427 Md. at 173, 46 A.3d <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"434\">*434</page-number>at 470. Observing that the MCSBA and the RAL legislation would impose contradicting requirements on a tax preparer who facilitates RALs, this Court concluded in <em>Gomez </em>that \u201cthe General Assembly never intended the [MJCSBA to apply to RALs.\u201d<footnotemark>22</footnotemark> 427 Md. at 177, 46 A.8d at 473. Against this backdrop, the \u201cdirect payment\u201d requirement was an instinctive way to reflect the lack of legislative \u201cintent to regulate income tax preparers that assist their clients receiving, through a third-party lender, a RAL, if they do not receive any payment directly from the consumer for that assistance.\u201d <em>Gomez, </em>427 Md. at 169, 46 A.3d at 468.</p>\n<p id=\"b466-4\">Unlike Jackson Hewitt\u2019s facilitation of RALs in <em>Gomez, </em>CashCall\u2019s activities constitute the very \u201cpayday loans\u201d that the General Assembly intended to prohibit. <em>See </em>discussion of the 2001 and 2010 amendments to the MCSBA, <em>swpra. </em>A payday loan is: \u201cA small, short-term, unsecured loan with a very high annual interest rate.\u201d Black\u2019s Law Dictionary 1079 (Bryan A. Garner ed., 10th ed. 2014). The loans CashCall \u201cmarketed\u201d meet this definition. Once again, we refer to the example of a typical transaction between CashCall and a Maryland consumer. CashCall offered unsecured loans of varying amounts. Where the consumer obtained a $2,600 loan, the stated interest rate was 99.24%. The short-term <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"435\">*435</page-number>nature of the loan is clear because the expected date the consumer would receive funding was December 13, 2006 \u2014 the first payment was due on January 01, 2007, less than a month after the consumer received the loan. Commissioner Kaufman recognized the same and discussed the limits of <em>Gomez </em>in the Final Order:</p>\n<blockquote id=\"b467-4\">The Court in <em>[Gomez </em>] did not consider the circumstances in which the consumer engages in a single commercial transaction with the credit services business____CashCall helped consumers obtain loans from out-of-state banks at rates that would otherwise be usurious under Maryland law ... To make the applicability of the MCSBA contingent on whether a consumer has made a \u201cdirect\u201d payment to CashCall would lead to absurd results.</blockquote>\n<p id=\"b467-6\">Accordingly, it is appropriate to limit the \u201cdirect payment\u201d requirement set forth in <em>Gomez </em>to \u201c \u2018mainstream\u2019 businesses that, like Jackson Hewitt, offer loan arrangement services as an ancillary service, separate and distinct from the principal services they provide to Maryland consumers.\u201d <em>CashCall, Inc., </em>225 Md.App. at 332, 124 A.3d at 681.</p>\n<p id=\"b467-7\">CashCall engaged in a \u201ccredit services business\u201d</p>\n<p id=\"b467-8\">A \u201ccredit services business\u201d is</p>\n<blockquote id=\"b467-9\">any person who, with respect to the extension of credit by others, sells, provides, or performs, or represents that such person can or will sell, provide, or perform, any of the following services in return for the payment of money or other valuable consideration:</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b467-10\">(i) Improving a consumer\u2019s credit record, history, or rating or establishing a new credit file or record;</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b467-11\">(ii) Obtaining an extension of credit for a consumer; or</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b467-12\">(iii) Providing advice or assistance to a consumer with regard to either subparagraph (i) or (ii) of this paragraph.</blockquote>\n<p id=\"b467-13\">CL \u00a7 14-1901(e)(l). Neither party disputes that CashCall \u201cprovided] advice or assistance to a consumer with regard to ... obtaining an extension of credit.\u201d <em>Id. </em>There is, however, a disagreement over whether CashCall provided such services <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"436\">*436</page-number>\u201cin return for the payment of money or other valuable consideration.\u201d <em>Id. </em>CashCall argues that it does not meet the definition of a \u201ccredit services business\u201d because it did not receive any direct payments from consumers for the assistance it provided to consumers to obtain loans. According to Cash-Call, the phrase \u201cin return for the payment of money or other valuable consideration\u201d requires that the consumer make a direct payment to the person or company providing \u201cadvice or assistance to a consumer with regard to ... obtaining an extension of credit.\u201d <em>Id. </em>As discussed above, the \u201cdirect payment\u201d requirement discussed in <em>Gomez </em>is limited to the factual boundaries of that case.</p>\n<p id=\"b468-4\">The facts in the record establish that CashCall \u201cprovid[ed] advice or assistance to a consumer with regard to ... obtaining an extension of credit.\u201d CL \u00a7 14 \u2014 1901(e). CashCall marketed loans through television and internet advertisements, directed consumers to fill out loan applications through CashCall\u2019s website and forwarded completed loan applications to various out-of-state banks. These actions comprised the entirety of CashCall\u2019s business model and resulted in Maryland consumers obtaining short-term loans with interest rates that greatly exceeded those permissible under Maryland law.</p>\n<p id=\"b468-5\">To be a \u201ccredit services business\u201d the services \u201cwith respect to the extension of credit by others\u201d must be provided \u201cin return for the payment of money or other valuable consideration.\u201d CL \u00a7 14-1901(e). As we noted previously, \u201cin return\u201d means \u201cin reciprocation, compensation, or repayment.\u201d Merriam Webster Collegiate Dictionary 1066 (11th ed. 2003). As the Commissioner contends, \u201cCashCall did not perform these loan arrangement services in Maryland for free; it was amply compensated for its loan operation.\u201d In exchange for CashCall\u2019s role in assisting consumers to obtain the aforementioned loans, CashCall received, through contracts with the banks, the exclusive right to collect all payments of principal, interest and fees, including the origination fee. This arrangement, in essence, rendered CashCall the <em>defacto </em>lender. This is evident when we look at the fact that CashCall received payment from the consumer for the \u201corigination fee.\u201d An <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"437\">*437</page-number>\u201corigination fee\u201d is \u201c[a] fee charged by a lender for preparing and processing the loan.\u201d Black\u2019s Law Dictionary 732 (Bryan A. Garner ed., 10th ed. 2014). Although the lending bank originally charged the origination fee, \u201c[t]he bank never received payment of that fee from the consumer but, as noted, CashCall did.\u201d <em>CashCall, Inc., </em>225 Md.App. at 334, 124 A.3d at 682. Furthermore, CashCall\u2019s raison d\u2019etre was to profit by purportedly providing advice and assistance to consumers in obtaining loans from the banks it had partnered with so that it would receive, \u201cin reciprocation\u201d the legal right to receive payments from consumers.<footnotemark>23</footnotemark> Merriam Webster Collegiate Dictionary 1066 (11th ed. 2003). This arrangement proved to be a lucrative business for CashCall due to the high interest rates on the loans and the late fees it was entitled to charge. Because CashCall provided the consumer with \u201cadvice or assistance\u201d in the obtention of an \u201cextension of credit by others,\u201d and was compensated for doing so, we conclude that CashCall engaged in a credit services business. CL \u00a7 14-1901(e).</p>\n<p id=\"b469-4\">We now discuss whether there was substantial evidence in the record before Commissioner Kaufman to support his finding that \u201cthere was a direct payment from the consumer to CashCall in connection with obtaining the loan and that Cash-Call provided credit services to Maryland consumers.\u201d The Commissioner asserts that there was. We agree and conclude that CashCall is subject to the requirements of the MCSBA. Moreover, even if the payments had not been direct, there was <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"438\">*438</page-number>substantial evidence in the record before Commissioner Kaufman that CashCall was engaged in a credit services business.</p>\n<p id=\"b470-4\">At the Exceptions hearing, the record before Commissioner Kaufman consisted of the Exceptions filed, the Proposed Decision, the Proposed Order, the transcript of the OAH proceedings in this matter, and all of the exhibits admitted at the OAH hearing.<footnotemark>24</footnotemark> The Consumer Loan Marketing, Origination, and Sale Agreement, between CashCall and First Bank &amp; Trust of Milbank and the amendment to that agreement (\u201cthe Sealed Agreements\u201d) supported Commissioner Kaufman\u2019s conclusions that CashCall was <em>\u201cobligated </em>to purchase the loans\u201d and \u201cupon assignment of a loan from the bank to CashCall, the bank\u2019s right, title and interest in the loans were assigned to CashCall.\u201d (emphasis in original). It also indicated that a \u201cclose review\u201d of the Sealed Agreements \u201cdemonstrated that CashCall received fees directly from the consumers in connection with its role.... marketing and soliciting the loans and transmitting the application to the lender.\u201d These agreements further obligated CashCall \u201cto repurchase the loans three days after the loans were disbursed.\u201d Commissioner Kaufman specifically refers to \u201cthe First Bank &amp; Trust Promissory Note and Disclosure Statement, dated as of December 12, 2006\u201d to explain how the consumers \u201cpaid fees directly to CashCall[:]\u201d</p>\n<blockquote id=\"b470-5\">[F]or a $2,600 consumer loan[,] [t]he \u201cfinanced\u201d amount of the loan is shown as $2,525.00.

As a result, the total amount of principal due from the consumer is $2,600.00.</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b471-3\"><page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"439\">*439</page-number>In order to understand the significance of the $75 fee, one must turn back to the Sealed Agreements. Pursuant to the Sealed Agreements, when CashCall purchased a loan, Cash-Call paid for the outstanding balance due, including all principal, interest, origination fees, and other charges or sums owed by the borrower. In other words, CashCall paid $2,600 for the loan. Because the loan was transferred from the bank to CashCall three days later, the consumer did not make a single payment to the bank.... The consumer [ ] directly paid CashCall, not the bank, because CashCall collected on the loan, which included the $75.00.</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b471-4\">Here, the consumer paid CashCall for the principal, interest, and <em>fees </em>on the loan. Therefore, CashCall received direct payments from the consumer for fees in connection with the application and origination of the loan, as stated on the Promissory Note.</blockquote>\n<p id=\"b471-5\">(footnote omitted) (emphasis in original). As the Final Order explained, there was ample evidence in the record to support the factual finding that Maryland consumers made \u201cdirect payments\u201d to CashCall for assistance in obtaining an extension of credit. Therefore, we hold that there was substantial evidence in the record to support the Commissioner\u2019s finding that by collecting the full value of the loan, including the origination fee paid by the consumer, CashCall engaged in a \u201ccredit services business.\u201d In addition, we hold that even if the record did not establish that \u201cdirect payments\u201d were made to CashCall, there was substantial evidence in the record to support the conclusion that CashCall\u2019s conduct met the definition of a \u201ccredit services business.\u201d</p>\n<p id=\"b471-6\">JUDGMENT OF THE COURT OF SPECIAL APPEALS AFFIRMED; COSTS TO BE PAID BY THE PETITIONERS.</p>\n<footnote label=\"1\">\n<p id=\"b447-11\">.

It appears that CashCalTs business activities constitute a \"rent-a-bank\u201d scheme. In a \"rent-a-bank\" scheme, a payday lender partners with a federally insured bank to take advantage of the bank\u2019s exemption from state usury caps. John D. Skees, <em>The Resurrection of Historic Usury Principles for Consumption Loans in a Federal Banking System, </em>55 Catholic U.L. Rev. 1131, 1150-52 (2006). In these partnerships, the federally insured bank makes the loan and the payday lender immediately purchases the loan from the bank. <em>Id. </em>This arrangement, in effect, allows a payday lender to rent the bank\u2019s charter in order to make loans that exceed state interest caps. <em>Id.</em></p>\n</footnote>\n<footnote label=\"13\">\n<p id=\"b452-7\">.

Now, if under the [MJCSBA, a tax preparer must wait three days before processing an application, that wait would violate the RAL statute's requirement that the application be processed \"promptly.\u201d If, however, a RAL application is processed promptly, yet a taxpayer decides to \"cancel\u201d a credit services agreement, there is really nothing to rescind.
