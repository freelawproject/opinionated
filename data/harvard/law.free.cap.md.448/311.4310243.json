Co. v. Kponve, </em>225 Md.App. 370, 124 A.3d 1147 (2015), is such a nonpareil.<footnotemark>3</footnotemark> Its explication and application of the relevant law to the questions presented to it is spot-on. The denouement of the opinion represents an elegant balance of justice and law.</p>\n<p id=\"b344-5\">Because the questions presented to this Court and the intermediate appellate court differ slightly, we elaborate briefly on that point alone. We granted Austria Kponve\u2019s Petition for a Writ of Certiorari in this case to consider the sole question of whether <em>Allstate Ins. Co. v. Miller, </em>315 Md. 182, 553 A.2d 1268 (1989) remains good law in Maryland, in light of the Court of Special Appeals\u2019s opinion in the present case. The parties disagree, of course, on the correct response to this query and, thus, we make clear our answer that <em>Allstate Ins. Co. v. Miller, </em>remains sound law. The Court of Special Appeals, in answering a different question put to it by the parties<footnotemark>4</footnotemark>, concluded that:</p>\n<blockquote id=\"b344-6\">Allstate was never sued in contract and therefore we are dealing with a tort case, pure and simple and not, as in <em>Miller, </em>with what was \u201cfunctionally ... a tort case.\u201d In a tort case, regardless as to whether policy limits are disput<page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"313\">*313</page-number>ed, the amount of uninsured motorist coverage is irrelevant \u2014 those limits would only have relevance if it was necessary to bring a breach of contract action against Allstate. There is no language in <em>Miller </em>that supports [Kponve\u2019s] position or bolsters the (implied) position of the trial judge in this case. Instead, the <em>Miller </em>case makes clear, that Allstate did not have the burden of proof as to contract damages in a tort case such as this.</blockquote>\n<p id=\"b345-5\"><em>Kponve, </em>225 Md.App. at 387-88, 124 A.3d at 1157-58. We do not perceive that the Court of Special Appeals disregarded or diminished, as Petitioner suggests, the vitality of the holding and reasoning in <em>Miller. </em>Rather, recognizing that the present case proceeded entirely as a tort action, and not a contract action, the judgment of the Court of Special Appeals, through its sound reasoning, placed, upon remand, this case on the correct <em>Miller </em>path.</p>\n<p id=\"b345-6\">JUDGMENT OF THE COURT OF SPECIAL APPEALS AFFIRMED.

The question presented to the Court of Special Appeals by Allstate asked whether it was erroneous for the Circuit Court for Montgomery County to deny Allstate\u2019s Post Trial Motion to Reduce the Judgment to conform to its uninsured/underinsured policy limit, which motion was filed by Allstate (an intervenor in the tort action) in the tort case brought by its insured against the potentially underinsured tortfeasor.</p>\n</footnote>\n</opinion>\n</casebody>\n",
