Maroney, <em>The False Promise of Adolescent Brain Science in Juvenile Justice, </em>85 <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"449\">*449</page-number>Notre Dame L. Rev. 89, 100 (2009) (\u201c[B]y the early 2000s neuroscience supported the notion that teen brains are structurally and functionally different from those of both children and adults.\u201d). Prominent among these dangers, and front and center in these cases, is alcohol. Today we address to what extent adults who allow underage persons to drink alcohol on their property \u2014 in violation of Md. Code (2002, 2012 Repl. Vol.), \u00a7 10-117(b) of the Criminal Law Article (\u201cCR\u201d) \u2014 are liable for injuries arising from the youth\u2019s intoxication.</p>\n<p id=\"b481-4\">The harm that alcohol poses to youths is pernicious, pervasive, and deadly<footnotemark>2</footnotemark> especially when motor vehicles are involved. <em>See </em>H.B. 299, Fiscal &amp; Policy Note, 2009 Reg. Sess., at 5 (Md. 2009) (\u201cAccording to the U.S. Department of Transportation, alcohol-impaired driving is one of the nation\u2019s deadliest crimes.\u201d); <em>id. </em>(explaining that, among all fatally injured alcohol-impaired drivers, the percentage of such drivers aged 16 to 20 \u201chas hovered around 25%\u201d since 1995).<footnotemark>3</footnotemark></p>\n<p id=\"b481-5\">Maryland established the minimum drinking age of 21 in 1982. <em>See </em>Maryland Code (1957, 1996 Repl. Vol.), \u00a7 400A of <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"450\">*450</page-number>Article 27; H.B. 85, Reg. Sess. (Md. 1982).<footnotemark>4</footnotemark> Unsurprisingly, underage people attempt to drink in spite of this law. One way underage people can circumvent a minimum drinking age law is to turn to adults over 21.</p>\n<p id=\"b482-4\">The General Assembly targeted adults in the fight to protect youths from alcohol when, in 1996, it enacted CR \u00a7 10-117(b). CR \u00a7 10-117(b), which contains exceptions not pertinent to the cases before us,<footnotemark>5</footnotemark> states that \u201can adult may not knowingly and willfully allow an individual under the age of 21 years actually to possess or consume an alcoholic beverage at a residence, or within the curtilage of a residence that the adult owns or leases and in which the adult resides.\u201d</p>\n<p id=\"b482-5\">It is against this backdrop that we confront two cases with the dangerous common denominator of underage people drinking alcohol on an adult\u2019s property, and then leaving that property in a motor vehicle. With respect to both cases, the facts are as alleged by the Petitioners in their complaints, or in the Kiriakos case, in the Motion For Summary Judgment, Opposition, or attachments thereto. In both cases, the consumption of alcohol was done with the knowledge and consent of the adult property owner.</p>\n<p id=\"b482-6\">FACTS AND LEGAL PROCEEDINGS</p>\n<p id=\"A3T\">\n<em>Case No. 55: Dankos</em>\n</p>\n<p id=\"b482-7\">17-year-old Steven Dankos (\u201cSteven\u201d) became intoxicated during a party at Linda Stapfs house on the evening of <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"451\">*451</page-number>November 28, 2009.<footnotemark>6</footnotemark> When Steven left early the next morning, still intoxicated, he rode in the bed of David Erdman\u2019s pickup truck. Erdman, another intoxicated partygoer who was 22 years old, crashed the truck shortly after leaving, and Steven was killed.</p>\n<p id=\"b483-5\">When Stapf first came home during the party, she found a large crowd at her house.<footnotemark>7</footnotemark> Stapf told her son Kevin that some people would have to leave, but she permitted him and some others to continue partying in the garage. Although Stapf knew some (like Kevin) were under 21 and some under 18, she allowed them to keep drinking.</p>\n<p id=\"b483-6\">During the party, Stapf sat in the kitchen near the garage and played solitaire. Alcohol was kept in the garage and made available to all guests. At least four times, she entered the garage to observe the goings-on. Although Stapf asked them to turn down the music, she did not ask or tell them to limit or stop drinking.</p>\n<p id=\"b483-7\">When Kelsey Erdman (\u201cKelsey\u201d) approached Stapf in the kitchen to express her concerns about her brother driving while intoxicated, Stapf did nothing. Stapf did not tell Kelsey to drive Erdman home, nor call Erdman\u2019s parents, nor even check on his condition. Stapf also did not attempt to prevent any intoxicated guests from driving off her premises.</p>\n<p id=\"b483-8\">Erdman crashed shortly after leaving the party. Steven, who rode in the truck bed, was ejected and killed.<footnotemark>8</footnotemark> The State charged Stapf with violating CR \u00a7 10 \u2014 117(b), but ultimately stetted this charge.</p>\n<p id=\"b483-9\">In May 2018, Nancy Dankos, Steven\u2019s mother, filed an amended complaint (\u201cAmended Complaint\u201d),<footnotemark>9</footnotemark> alleging various <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"452\">*452</page-number>claims against Stapf that sounded in negligence: common law social host liability; breach of duties arising out of Maryland criminal law statutes;<footnotemark>10</footnotemark> breach of a duty to act;<footnotemark>11</footnotemark> a wrongful death claim; and a survival action. Stapf filed a motion to dismiss for failure to state a claim, arguing principally that Dankos had failed to allege the breach of a legally cognizable duty. The Circuit Court for Howard County granted the motion in substantial part.<footnotemark>12</footnotemark></p>\n<p id=\"b484-5\">Following her timely notice of appeal,<footnotemark>13</footnotemark> the Court of Special Appeals affirmed. <em>Davis v. Stapf, </em>224 Md.App. 393, 398, 120 A.3d 890, <em>cert. granted sub nom. Dankos v. Stapf, </em>445 Md. 4, 122 A.3d 974 (2015).<footnotemark>14</footnotemark> Although the intermediate appellate court concluded that Dankos properly alleged a duty, it still affirmed the dismissal for lack of proximate cause. <em>Id. </em>at 424-25, 120 A.3d 890. The court\u2019s conclusion about proximate cause was also fatal to Dankos\u2019s other claims of breach of a duty. <em>Id. </em>at 425-29, 120 A.3d 890.</p>\n<p id=\"b484-6\">\n<em>Case No. 20: Kiriakos</em>\n</p>\n<p id=\"b484-7\">Manal Kiriakos was walking her dogs on the sidewalk one morning when 18-year-old Shetmiyah Robinson, driving a <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"453\">*453</page-number>large sport utility vehicle, hit Kiriakos, causing her life-threatening injuries.<footnotemark>15</footnotemark></p>\n<p id=\"b485-4\">The prior afternoon and evening, Robinson had been working with Brandon Phillips and another man at Phillips\u2019s house.<footnotemark>16</footnotemark> They began drinking a bottle of vodka and some champagne around 10:00 p.m. Phillips himself mixed the vodka in Robinson\u2019s drink with orange juice. Phillips, age 26, knew that Robinson was 18, that Robinson had driven to Phillips\u2019s house and would have to drive to leave, and that Robinson had too much to drink. Because of the quantity Robinson consumed,<footnotemark>17</footnotemark> Phillips told Robinson to \u201cwatch what he\u2019s drinking.\u201d Phillips also offered to let Robinson sleep at his place, but said that Robinson could leave \u201cwhenever he was ready\u201d if he \u201cwas sure that he was going to be able to drive.\u201d Robinson decided to wait for the effects of the alcohol to wear off, and left around 4:00 or 5:00 a.m.</p>\n<p id=\"b485-5\">Robinson struck Kiriakos about one hour later. The officer who arrived at the scene detected \u201ca strong odor\u201d of alcohol on Robinson\u2019s breath. This officer also noticed that Robinson\u2019s eyes were bloodshot and that vomit was on his sweatshirt. Robinson consented to a preliminary breath test, which measured a BAC of .088. Based on the sobriety test, among <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"454\">*454</page-number>other things, the officer placed Robinson under arrest.<footnotemark>18</footnotemark> At the precinct, Robinson consented to take a breath test, which measured a BAC of .08.</p>\n<p id=\"b486-5\">Kiriakos filed an amended complaint against multiple defendants,<footnotemark>19</footnotemark> including Phillips. The sole count against Phillips sounded in negligence. Kiriakos alleged that Phillips owed a duty \u201cto the public in general,\u201d including her, not to provide alcohol and illegal drugs to someone \u201cunder-aged\u201d when he knew or should have known the under-aged person would drive under the influence of alcohol and drugs. Phillips filed a motion for summary judgment, arguing that \u201cMaryland does not recognize social host liability for serving alcohol.\u201d After a hearing, the Circuit Court for Baltimore County granted Phillips\u2019s motion, refusing to find that Phillips owed Kiriakos a legal duty, and explaining that \u201cI\u2019m bound by the law as it exists in the present day and Maryland simply has consistently refused for other reasons to extend liability that far.\u201d The Court of Special Appeals, in an unreported opinion, affirmed the Circuit Court\u2019s grant of summary judgment.</p>\n<p id=\"b486-6\">STANDARD OF REVIEW</p>\n<p id=\"b486-7\">We review for legal correctness a trial court\u2019s decision to grant a motion to dismiss for failure to state a claim. <em>Rounds v. Md.-Nat\u2019l Capital Park &amp; Planning Comm\u2019n, </em>441 Md. 621, 685-36, 109 A.3d 639 (2015). At this stage, we shall assume the truth of those facts and allegations in the complaint, and all inferences reasonably drawn therefrom. <em>Id. </em>at 636, 109 A.3d 639.</p>\n<p id=\"b487-4\"><page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"455\">*455</page-number>On appeal from the grant of summary judgment, we \u201cindependently review the record\u201d to ascertain whether there is a genuine dispute of material fact and, \u201cif not, whether the moving party is entitled to judgment as a matter of law.\u201d <em>Wells Fargo Home Mortg., Inc. v. </em>Neal, 398 Md. 705, 714, 922 A.2d 538 (2007) (citation and internal quotation marks omitted). When, as here, we discern no genuine dispute of material fact,<footnotemark>20</footnotemark> we must determine whether the trial court was legally correct in granting summary judgment, and accord the trial court\u2019s decision no deference. <em>Id.</em></p>\n<p id=\"b487-5\">DISCUSSION</p>\n<p id=\"b487-6\">With respect to both cases, we hold that there exists a limited form of social host liability sounding in negligence\u2014 based on the strong public policy reflected in CR \u00a7 10-117(b), but that it only exists when the adults in question act knowingly and willfully, as required by the statute. As we explain, <em>infra, </em>this knowing and willful requirement removes any issue of contributory negligence on the part of the underage drinker vis-\u00e1-vis his claim against the adult, even though the cause of action otherwise sounds in negligence. We address the specific questions presented in each case below.</p>\n<p id=\"b487-7\">\n<em>Case No. 55: Dankos</em>\n</p>\n<p id=\"b487-8\">We granted Dankos\u2019s Petition for Writ of Certiorari to address the following questions:<footnotemark>21</footnotemark></p>\n<blockquote id=\"b488-3\"><page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"456\">*456</page-number>1. Where the Court of Special Appeals found Stapf owed a duty of care to Steven arising from her alleged violation of CR \u00a7 10 \u2014 117(b), did it err in concluding that Petitioners could not, as a matter of law, establish Stapf was the proximate cause of Steven\u2019s injuries?</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b488-4\">2. Where Petitioners alleged that a special relationship existed between the youth on Stapfs property and Stapf, did the Court of Special Appeals err when [it] failed to recognize a cause of action arising from this special relationship based on its conclusion that Petitioners could not, as a matter of law, establish that Stapf was a proximate cause of Steven\u2019s death?</blockquote>\n<p id=\"b488-5\">Because we answer yes to the first question, we shall reverse without reaching the second question.</p>\n<p id=\"b488-6\">All of the counts in Dankos\u2019s complaint sounded in negligence. A plaintiff bringing a negligence claim must establish four elements: \u201ca duty owed to him (or to a class of which he is a part), a breach of that duty, a legally cognizable causal relationship between the breach of duty and the harm suffered, and damages.\u201d <em>Jacques v. First Nat\u2019l Bank of Md., </em>307 Md. 527, 531, 515 A.2d 756 (1986). Dankos contends that CR \u00a7 10-117(b) creates a legal duty for Stapf, a homeowner, to prevent Steven, a minor, from consuming alcohol on her premises.<footnotemark>22</footnotemark> Additionally, Dankos argues that because this duty arises out of a statute and not the common law, the proximate cause analysis is not governed by archaic common law cases such as <em>State for Use of Joyce v. Hatfield, </em>197 Md. 249, 78 A.2d 754 (1951). In her view, the Circuit Court incorrectly granted the motion to dismiss because she properly alleged that Stapf was a proximate cause of Steven\u2019s injuries. First we address Stapfs duty to Dankos, and then we move to proximate causation.</p>\n<p id=\"b489-4\"><page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"457\">*457</page-number>Duty</p>\n<p id=\"b489-5\">We have often explained that a statute or ordinance can prescribe a duty and that \u201c \u2018violation of the statute or ordinance is itself evidence of negligence.\u2019\u201d <em>Blackburn Ltd. P\u2019ship v. Paul, </em>438 Md. 100, 111, 90 A.3d 464 (2014) (quoting <em>Brooks v. Lewin Realty III, Inc., </em>378 Md. 70, 78, 835 A.2d 616 (2003)). Under this rule (\u201cthe Statute or Ordinance Rule\u201d),<footnotemark>23</footnotemark> Dankos must meet two prerequisites to establish a prima facie case in negligence: (1) show \u201cthe violation of a statute or ordinance designed to protect a specific class of persons [], and [ (2) ] that the violation proximately caused the injury complained of.\u201d Id. at 112, 90 A.3d 464 (citations and internal quotation marks omitted). The Statute or Ordinance Rule is not a means to establishing negligence per se but only prima facie evidence of negligence. See <em>id. </em>at 126, 90 A.3d 464; <em>Polakoff v. Turner, </em>385 Md. 467, 478, 869 A.2d 837 (2005); <em>cf. </em>W. Page Keeton et al., Prosser and Keeton on Torts \u00a7 36, at 230 (5th ed. 1984) (\u201cA large number of courts have held that a violation is only evidence of negligence, or prima facie evidence thereof, which may be accepted or rejected according to all of the evidence.\u201d).<footnotemark>24</footnotemark></p>\n<p id=\"b489-6\">\n<em>Statute or Ordinance Rule: The Protected Class</em>\n</p>\n<p id=\"b489-7\">CR \u00a7 10-117, Dankos avers, is designed to protect a specific class of persons: people under 21 who are unrelated to the homeowner and who are not consuming alcohol for religious purposes. According to Stapf, Dankos misinterprets CR \u00a7 10-117(b) \u2014 the statute does not, in her mind, serve to protect a specific class of people. For support, Stapf draws upon the legislative history that indicates to her the General <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"458\">*458</page-number>Assembly\u2019s concern with drinking and driving, a broad public problem. To resolve their dispute, we start with the cases discussing a doctrine we have called the Statute or Ordinance Rule \u2014 in aid of determining whether CR \u00a7 10-117 is sufficiently focused on a specific class to create a duty.</p>\n<p id=\"b490-4\">In <em>Brooks, </em>378 Md. at 78, 835 A.2d 616, the Court reviewed the history of the Statute or Ordinance Rule: \u201c[a]lmost ninety years ago, our predecessors in <em>Flaccomio v. Eysink, </em>129 Md. 367, 380 [100 A. 510] (1916), held that \u2018the violation of a statute ... is itself sufficient to prove such a breach of duty as will sustain a private action for negligence, ... and that the true rule in such cases is that the violation is presumptive evidence of negligence.\u2019 \u201d (Citing cases spanning 50 years). This is a \u201cwell-settled Maryland common law rule [ ] long [ ] applied by this Court in negligence actions.\u201d <em>Id.</em></p>\n<p id=\"b490-5\"><em>Brooks </em>concerned a lead paint poisoning negligence action arising out of alleged violations of the Baltimore City Code, which mandated \u201cremoval of flaking, loose, or peeling paint.\u201d <em>Id. </em>at 82, 835 A.2d 616. Applying the Statute or Ordinance Rule, the <em>Brooks </em>Court explained that the plaintiff, a boy, was \u201cobviously within a class of persons which the Housing Code was designed to protect.\u201d <em>Id. </em>at 81, 835 A.2d 616 (citing <em>Brown v. Dermer, </em>357 Md. 344, 367, 744 A.2d 47 (2000)) (\u201cPatently, by enacting \u00a7\u00a7 702 and 703 of the Housing Code, the City Council sought to protect children from lead paint poisoning by putting landlords on notice of conditions which could enhance the risk of such injuries.\u201d). Reasoning that because the boy\u2019s \u201cinjury, lead poisoning, is the kind of injury intended to be prevented by the Code,\u201d we held that he had established a prima facie case in negligence. <em>Id. </em>at 89, 835 A.2d 616.</p>\n<p id=\"b490-6\"><em>Blackburn </em>is also instructive.<footnotemark>25</footnotemark> In <em>Blackburn, </em>438 Md. at 125-26, 90 A.3d 464, we held that Code of Maryland Regula<page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"459\">*459</page-number>tions (\u201cCOMAR\u201d) 10.17.01.21 \u2014 requiring fences with certain specifications be maintained around swimming pools \u2014 protected a specific class of persons, namely, children under the age of five. Although the petitioners argued that the regulatory provision did not name a specific protected class, we disagreed because COMAR incorporated a code which identified such a class: \u201cchildren in the most at-risk age group, less than five (5) years of age.\u201d <em>Id. </em>at 122-26, 90 A.3d 464 (emphasis omitted); <em>see also Brooks, </em>378 Md. at 81, 835 A.2d 616 (\u201cPatently, by enacting \u00a7\u00a7 702 and 703 of the Housing Code, the City Council sought to protect children from lead paint poisoning by putting landlords on notice of conditions which could enhance the risk of such injuries.\u201d) (quoting <em>Brown, </em>357 Md. at 367, 744 A.2d 47).</p>\n<p id=\"b491-5\">In <em>Warr v. JMGM Group, LLC, </em>433 Md. 170, 195-99, 70 A.3d 347 (2013), on the other hand, we held that the defendant tavern owners did not owe a duty to the plaintiffs under a criminal statute prohibiting the sale of alcohol to visibly intoxicated persons.<footnotemark>26</footnotemark> (Referring to Maryland Code (1957, 2011 Repl. Vol.), \u00a7 12-108(a)(l) of Article 2B). Our holding was grounded in our conclusion that the statute was part of a scheme designed to protect a general class of people: \u201c[t]he statutes regulating the sale of alcohol and prohibiting its provision to those visibly intoxicated were enacted \u2018for the protection, health, welfare and safety of <em>the people of this State.\u2019 \u201d Id. </em>at 198, 70 A.3d 347 (quoting Article 2B, \u00a7 1-101(a)(3)) (emphasis added).</p>\n<p id=\"b491-6\">Relevant to this case, CR \u00a7 10-117(b) states that \u201can adult may not knowingly and willfully allow <em>an individual under the age of 21 years </em>actually to possess or consume an alcoholic beverage at a residence, or within the curtilage of a residence that the adult owns or leases and in which the adult resides.\u201d <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"460\">*460</page-number>(Emphasis added.) The law holds adults criminally responsible for underage drinking under specific circumstances. Like the regulation in <em>Blackburn, </em>CR \u00a7 10~117(b) identifies a specific class that the General Assembly sought to protect: underage people exposed to alcohol. The text of the statute makes clear to us the General Assembly\u2019s concern for this specific class. <em>See also Allen v. Dackman, </em>413 Md. 132, 156-57, 991 A.2d 1216 (2010) (determining that the Housing Code was intended to protect \u201coccupants of dwellings\u201d because the code said so). We disagree with Stapfs assertion that CR \u00a7 10-117(b) \u201cwas not designed to protect a singular class of persons.\u201d Moreover, we do not hesitate to apply the Statute or Ordinance Rule on different facts than in prior cases because this is a rule of \u201cbroad applicability.\u201d <em>Blackburn, </em>438 Md. at 115, 90 A.3d 464 (acknowledging the rule\u2019s applicability in the context of lead paint cases, sediment control regulations, and animal control statutes, among others).<footnotemark>27</footnotemark></p>\n<p id=\"b492-5\">Other courts have determined that underage persons constituted a protected class in statutes similar to CR \u00a7 10-117(b). <em>See Newsome v. Haffner, </em>710 So.2d 184, 185-86 (Fla.Dist.Ct.App.1998) (concluding that a duty of care on adult social hosts arose out of a criminal statute because the law was \u201cclearly designed to protect minors from the harm that could result from the consumption of alcohol\u201d); <em>Hansen v. Friend, </em>118 Wash.2d 476, 824 P.2d 483, 485-86 (1992) (\u201c[The statute] prohibits persons from furnishing liquor to a minor.

To establish proximate cause in this context, Dankos must show that Steven \u201cis within the class of persons sought to be protected [by the statute], and [that] the harm suffered is of a kind which the drafters intended the statute to prevent.\u201d <em>Id. </em>(citations and internal quotation marks omitted). Dankos contends that Steven, a minor, is a member of the class that CR \u00a7 10-117(b) seeks to protect, and that he also suffered the harm this statute is designed to prevent. That harm, in her view, is the risk or danger to which alcohol exposes underage persons.</p>\n<p id=\"b495-5\">CR \u00a7 10 \u2014 117(b) prohibits adults from allowing \u201can individual under the age of 21 years actually to possess or consume an alcoholic beverage.\u201d CR \u00a7 10 \u2014 117(b). The statute seeks to prevent harm to underage persons as a result of their consumption of alcohol, as is repeatedly expressed in the legislative history for this statute. Those in support of the bill that became CR \u00a7 10-117(b) evinced a deep concern for the protection of underage people from alcohol and the risks alcohol poses to them and the loss of judgment that leads to risky behavior \u2014 like getting into a car with a fellow partygoer who is too impaired to drive.<footnotemark>30</footnotemark> Letter from Melvin Stern, Chair, Legis.

In her complaint, Dankos alleged that Stapf violated CR \u00a7 10 \u2014 117(b). She alleged that Steven was 17 and consuming alcohol on Stapf s property prior to the accident. She further alleged that Steven\u2019s \u201cdegree of intoxication\u201d inhibited his ability to make a reasonable decision about how to leave the party. Finally, she alleged that Steven\u2019s death in the car accident was a direct, proximate result of Stapfs actions. In essence, Dankos alleges that Stapf allowed Steven to get so intoxicated that he might put himself in danger \u2014 the very harm that CR \u00a7 10-U7(b) seeks to prevent. We conclude that Dankos has adequately pled the second prong, and <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"465\">*465</page-number>thus, that she has adequately pled the duty and breach elements of negligence using the Statute or Ordinance Rule.<footnotemark>32</footnotemark></p>\n<p id=\"b497-4\">Proximate Cause</p>\n<p id=\"b497-5\">We now consider whether she can survive the defense motion to dismiss on the issue of proximate cause. <em>See Blackburn, </em>438 Md. at 126, 90 A.3d 464 (concluding, on review of motion for summary judgment, that there was a statutory duty, then noting that the plaintiff \u201cmust still produce facts that would allow a jury\u201d to find causation). On this very contentious issue, the parties share one common view: a defendant\u2019s negligence is the proximate cause of a plaintiffs injury when the negligence is \u201c(1) a cause in fact, and (2) a legally cognizable cause.\u201d <em>CR-RSC Tower I, LLC v.

We noted that the first step, causation-in-fact, involves the determination of \u201cwho or what caused an action.\u201d <em>Pittway, </em>409 Md. at 244, 973 A.2d 771. When an injury arises from \u201ctwo or more independent negligent acts,\u201d as in this case, we apply the substantial factor test. <em>Id. </em>Thus we ask \u201cif it is \u2018more likely than not\u2019 that the defendant\u2019s conduct was a substantial factor in producing the [plaintiffs] injuries.\u201d <em>Id. </em>To determine what \u201csubstantial factor\u201d means, we look to the Restatement (Second) of Torts, which we have adopted for this purpose. <em>Id. </em>at 244-45, 973 A.2d 771.</p>\n<p id=\"b497-7\">Under the second step, legally cognizable cause, we \u201cconsider whether the actual harm to a litigant falls within a general field [of danger] that the actor should have anticipated or expected.\u201d <em>Id. </em>at 245, 973 A.2d 771.

Thus, Stapf concludes, the \u201cnexus between [her] acquiescence and [Steven\u2019s] death is far too remote to be considered a proximate cause.\u201d</p>\n<p id=\"b498-7\">The Court in <em>Hatfield </em>stated that \u201c[h]uman beings, drunk or sober, are responsible for their own torts. The law <em>(apart from </em>statute) recognizes no relation of proximate cause between a sale of liquor and a tort committed by a buyer who has drunk the liquor.\u201d <em>Hatfield, </em>197 Md. at 254, 78 A.2d 754 (emphasis added). We recognize that the intoxicated person in <em>Hatfield </em>was, as Steven was, a minor. <em>See Hatfield, </em>197 Md. at 251, 78 A.2d 754. But <em>Hatfield </em>was decided before the enactment of CR \u00a7 10-117(b). At the time of <em>Hatfield, </em>there was no law similar to CR \u00a7 10-117(b), which prohibits adults from allowing underage persons to drink alcohol on their property. The enactment of CR \u00a7 10 \u2014 117(b) reflects a determination by the General Assembly that more protection of youths from alcohol was needed.</p>\n<p id=\"b498-8\">In <em>Ely v. Murphy, </em>207 Conn. 88, 540 A.2d 54, 55, 58 (1988), the Supreme Court of Connecticut concluded that an underage person\u2019s consumption of alcohol at a house party did not immunize the hosts for the injuries that the underage person caused another guest. Among other things, state law criminalized furnishing alcohol to minors by social hosts. <em>Id. </em>at 57. This and other state laws, the court explained, constituted a \u201clegislative determination that minors are incompetent to assimilate responsibly the effects of alcohol and lack the legal <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"467\">*467</page-number>capacity to do so.\u201d <em>Id. </em>at 58. Because of this legislative framework, the <em>Ely </em>court distinguished the premise of the common law proximate cause rule with respect to underage persons: \u201cThe proposition that intoxication results from the voluntary conduct of the person who consumes intoxicating liquor <em>assumes a knowing and intelligent exercise of choice, </em>and for that reason is more applicable to adults than to minors.\u201d <em>Id. </em>at 57 (emphasis added).</p>\n<p id=\"b499-5\">Many jurisdictions, in addition to Connecticut, agree that underage persons lack full adult capacity to handle alcohol. <em>See Marcum, </em>643 S.E.2d at 89 (\u201cWhile underage persons have full social and civil rights, we find the public policy of this State treats these individuals as lacking full adult capacity to make informed decisions concerning the ingestion of alcoholic beverages.\u201d); <em>Newsome, </em>710 So.2d at 185 (\u201cThe statute makes a violation of this provision a criminal offense, and is clearly designed to protect minors from the harm that could result from the consumption of alcohol or drugs by those who are too immature to appreciate the potential consequences.\u201d); <em>Hansen, </em>824 P.2d at 486 (\u201cThe Legislature believed that persons under 21 years of age are neither physically nor mentally equipped to handle the consumption of intoxicating liquor.\u201d); <em>DiOssi v. Maroney, </em>548 A.2d 1361, 1368 (Del.1988) (\u201cThe longstanding legislative restriction on the dispensing of alcoholic beverages to minors in Delaware attests to a settled public policy that minors are not deemed free agents in the decision to consume intoxicating beverages or, having done so, are not solely responsible for the harmful consequences of such overindulgence.\u201d);<footnotemark>33</footnotemark> <em>Congini by Congini, </em>470 A.2d at 517 (\u201c[O]ur legislature has made a legislative judgment that persons under twenty-one years of age are incompetent to handle alcohol....

Sage, </em>437 N.W.2d at 584 (\u201cA minor consumer of alcoholic beverages should not automatically be precluded from recovering damages resulting from the effects of alcohol\u201d because such persons, \u201cparticularly those who are very young or immature, cannot be said to have been so negligent or to have assumed so much of the risk involved____\u201d).</p>\n<p id=\"b500-5\">We do not go so far as the courts reaching the bald conclusions that minors under the age of 21, as a group, are not \u201cfree agents,\u201d or \u201care not legally competent to handle alcohol,\u201d or that they \u201care incompetent to assimilate responsibly the effects of alcohol,\u201d or that they \u201care neither physically nor mentally equipped to handle the consumption of intoxicating liquor.\u201d We view CR \u00a7 10-117(b) as a recognition by the General Assembly, based on convincing evidence, that children under 21 are often less able to make responsible decisions regarding the consumption of alcohol and, as a result, are more susceptible to harming themselves or others when presented with the opportunity to drink in excess in a social, peer-pressured setting. It therefore carved out that specific class for special protection against adult social hosts who knowingly and willfully allow consumption of alcoholic beverages on their property.</p>\n<p id=\"b500-6\">At least two conclusions relevant to the cases before us flow from that legislative recognition and determination. First, upon a finding that the social host defendant knowingly and willfully allowed a member of the protected class to consume alcohol on the host\u2019s premises in violation of the statute, in an action against the social host brought by or on behalf of the minor or, as in the Kiriakos case, by an injured third party, such conduct \u2014 if it substantially contributed to a diminution of the underaged person\u2019s ability to act in a reasonable manner, and thereby caused injury \u2014 can be found to be a substantial factor in bringing about the harm to the underage person himself or to a third party. <em>See EaglePicher Indus., Inc. v. Balbos, </em>326 Md. 179, 208-09, 604 A.2d 445 (1992) (enunciating substantial-factor causation rule). This conclusion partakes both of the duty and proximate cause <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"469\">*469</page-number>components of an action based on negligence. Second, contributory negligence is not a defense in an action by a protected class member against a social host defendant. That is as far as we need to go in these cases.</p>\n<p id=\"b501-4\">Other courts have ruled that a social host claim does not fail as a matter of law on the issue of proximate cause. <em>See Estate of Hernandez by Hernandez-Wheeler, </em>866 P.2d at 1341 (\u201cA minor is similar to an adult who has diminished judgment and capacity to control his alcohol consumption____Nor are considerations of proximate causation a reason to conclude there is no liability as a matter of law in all cases.\u201d); <em>DiOssi, </em>548 A.2d at 1368 (determining the case on premises liability but also concluding that a minor\u2019s voluntary consumption of alcohol is not an intervening cause sufficient to relieve a social host of liability to a third party); <em>Ely, </em>540 A.2d at 58 (\u201c[Ljogic dictates that their [minors\u2019] consumption of alcohol does not, as a matter of law, constitute the intervening act necessary to break the chain of proximate causation and does not, as a matter of law, insulate one who provides alcohol to minors from liability for ensuing injury.\u201d); <em>Longstreth, </em>377 N.W.2d at 813-14 (rejecting the traditional rule that the drinking of alcohol is the proximate cause of the injury); <em>Koback v. Crook, </em>123 Wis.2d 259, 366 N.W.2d 857, 859-61 (1985) (same), <em>superseded by statute on other grounds, </em>1985 Wis. Sess. Laws 625, Wis. Stat. Ann. \u00a7 125.035; <em>see also Linn v. Rand, </em>140 N.J.Super. 212, 356 A.2d 15, 19 (Ct.App.Div.1976) (\u201c[A] social host who serves excessive amounts of alcoholic beverages to a visibly intoxicated minor, knowing the minor was about to drive a car on the public highways, could reasonably foresee or anticipate an accident or injury as a reasonably foreseeable consequence of his negligence in serving the minor.\u201d).</p>\n<p id=\"b501-6\">We view CR \u00a7 10-117(b) as a substantial development in the law from the days of <em>Hatfield. </em>Guided by the statute, we conclude that Steven\u2019s decision to drink did not render the nexus between Stapfs conduct and his death too remote to preclude Stapfs conduct, as a matter of law, from being considered a proximate cause of his death. Accordingly, the common law rule in <em>Hatfield </em>poses no bar to a claim of social <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"470\">*470</page-number>host liability predicated on CR \u00a7 10 \u2014 117(b) for injuries to a minor intoxicated on the adult\u2019s property.<footnotemark>34</footnotemark></p>\n<p id=\"b502-4\">\n<em>Causation-in-Fact</em>\n</p>\n<p id=\"b502-5\">In examining causation-in-fact, we are mindful that proximate cause is ordinarily a jury question. <em>Lashley v.

When she requested that some people leave, the smaller group that Stapf permitted to remain proceeded to her garage. Entering the garage at least four times, Stapf observed guests, including underage persons, drinking throughout the evening. She knew that Steven and Erdman were intoxicated, and that they had driven to her home by ear. Stapf later described Steven to the police as \u201cnot right, tired, like drunk.\u201d Kelsey informed Stapf of her concern that Erdman would drive despite his state of intoxication. Stapf did nothing after Kelsey raised her concern, and Stapf made no attempt to prevent the intoxicated guests, including Erdman, from leaving by car. Erdman crashed his vehicle, with Steven in the truck bed, shortly after leaving Stapf s residence.</p>\n<p id=\"b503-10\">A jury, if it found these facts, could reasonably determine that Stapf, \u201ccreated a force or series of forces which [we]re in continuous and active operation up to the time of the harm\u201d to Steven. <em>Pittway, </em>409 Md. at 245, 973 A.2d 771 (quoting Section 433 of the Restatement (Second) of Torts).

In focusing on whether an actor should have anticipated or expected a harm, we concern ourselves primarily with whether the harm was foreseeable as a consequence of the actor\u2019s negligence. <em>Id. </em>at 246, 973 A.2d 771.</p>\n<p id=\"b504-7\">Stapf objects to imposing liability \u201cif for example the negligence of one person is merely passive and potential, while the negligence of another is the moving and effective cause of <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"473\">*473</page-number>the injury.\u201d (Quoting <em>Wankel v. A &amp; B Contractors, Inc., </em>127 Md.App. 128, 159, 732 A.2d 333 (1999)). This passive negligence concept first appeared in <em>Bloom v. Good Humor Ice Cream Co. of Balt., </em>179 Md. 384, 18 A.2d 592 (1941). In <em>Bloom, </em>the Court concluded that an ice cream truck driver was not the proximate cause of the injuries to a ten-year-old boy who, after making a purchase from the truck parked on the street, was struck by another vehicle while returning to the sidewalk. <em>Id. </em>at 387-89, 18 A.2d 592. More recent cases criticized the use of passive negligence as a factor in legal causation by noting that it \u201coverlook[s] entirely the matter of foreseeability.\u201d <em>Matthews v. Amberwood Assocs. Ltd. P\u2019ship, Inc., </em>351 Md. 544, 576-80, 719 A.2d 119 (1998) (no error in refusing to give a proposed jury instruction on proximate cause with the passive negligence concept); <em>see also id. </em>at 577, 719 A.2d 119 (\u201cSubsequent opinions of this Court have limited the \u2018passive\u2019 negligence language of <em>Bloom, </em>and indeed have limited the holding in that case, to the type of factual situation there involved.\u201d). No Maryland appellate decision on a proximate cause question since <em>Bloom </em>has used this passive negligence concept. <em>See, e.g., Collins v. Li, </em>176 Md.App. 502, 573-77, 933 A.2d 528 (2007) (\u201cFrom the foregoing [discussion of <em>Bloom </em>and <em>Matthews </em>], the concept of passive negligence in an \u2018intervening negligent act/superseding cause\u2019 analysis is looked upon with disfavor without a consideration of the factors, relative to foreseeability.\u201d). Thus, we conclude that Stapfs legal causation argument, at least its focus, misses the mark.</p>\n<p id=\"b505-5\">Rather we inquire, in a case where there are multiple alleged negligent actors, \u201cwhether a negligent defendant is relieved from liability by intervening negligent acts or omissions.\u201d <em>Pittway, </em>409 Md. at 247, 973 A.2d 771. If the intervening negligent act is unusual and extraordinary such that the original tortfeasor could not have anticipated the intervening act, then the act is a superseding cause, and the original tortfeasor may not be liable. <em>Id. </em>at 247, 249, 973 A.2d 771.</p>\n<p id=\"b506-3\"><page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"474\">*474</page-number>Taking the facts as Dankos has alleged them, we easily conclude that Erdman\u2019s act of driving drunk, and injuring Steven, both guests at Stapfs house, was foreseeable. Indeed, Stapf was told by Kelsey that she was concerned about Erdman driving after being intoxicated. Stapf knew that Steven and Erdman, among others, were drinking and became intoxicated at the party. She also knew that they had driven to the party and \u201ccould not make informed and intelligent decisions,\u201d such as how to leave the party safely. Thus, a jury could conclude that Stapf \u201cshould have anticipated or expected\u201d the harm that befell Steven. Pittway, 409 Md. at 245, 973 A.2d 771. Dankos has alleged sufficient facts to survive the motion to dismiss.</p>\n<p id=\"b506-4\">Contributory Negligence</p>\n<p id=\"b506-5\">For the benefit of the trial court on remand, we address whether contributory negligence is an available defense in these causes of action.<footnotemark>38</footnotemark> Contributory negligence, normally a defense to negligence, is not available when a defendant violates an exceptional statute, the effect of which \u201cis to place the entire responsibility for such harm as has occurred upon the defendant.\u201d <em>Brady v. Ralph M. Parsons Co., </em>327 Md. 275, 291, 609 A.2d 297 (1992) (quoting Restatement (Second) of Torts \u00a7 483). Comment c to Section 483 of the Second Restatement of Torts explains that \u201c[a] statute may be found to have that purpose [of shifting responsibility] particularly where it is enacted in order to protect a certain class of persons against their own inability to protect themselves.\u201d Restatement (Second) of Torts \u00a7 483 cmt. c.; <em>see also </em>Keeton et al., <em>supra </em>at \u00a7 65, at 461-62 (same). CR \u00a7 10-117(b) clearly was enacted to protect underage people from the seductive call of alcohol and its effects. The statute was <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"475\">*475</page-number>drawn carefully to limit criminal liability to a knowing and willful violation by the defendant, and we have so limited these civil causes of actions. For these reasons we conclude that negligent actions of the underage person in getting intoxicated cannot be the basis of a contributory negligence defense in an action against the person violating CR \u00a7 10-117(b).<footnotemark>39</footnotemark> <em>Cf. State Farm Mut. Auto. Ins. Co. v. Hill, </em>139 Md.App. 308, 315-18, 775 A.2d 476 (2001) (contributory negligence does not bar recovery in an action involving an intentional tort); Restatement (Second) of Torts \u00a7 483.</p>\n<p id=\"b507-5\">In sum, Dankos may maintain her negligence claim arising out of CR \u00a7 10-117(b) against Stapf past the motion to dismiss stage. We are mindful of Stapfs argument that this case presents \u201ca matter of public concern that is best left to the General Assembly of Maryland to decide.\u201d Our courts have nodded to the General Assembly when confronted with questions of whether to recognize common law claims of social host or licensee liability. <em>Warr, </em>433 Md. at 199, 70 A.3d 347; <em>Felder v. Butler, </em>292 Md. 174, 183-84, 438 A.2d 494 (1981); <em>Hatfield, </em>197 Md. at 256, 78 A.2d 754. But as we have discussed, what distinguishes Dankos\u2019s claim is the statute the General Assembly passed and in which we identify a civil duty, CR \u00a7 10-117(b). Indeed, it is from this statute that we also identify a legislative recognition that minors such as Steven have a reduced ability to handle alcohol. As such, we refuse to construe a minor\u2019s decision to consume alcohol voluntarily as the proximate cause of his injuries. Because our analysis tracks CR \u00a7 10-117(b) closely, we do not consider our decision an intrusion into the General Assembly\u2019s arena.</p>\n<p id=\"b507-6\">\n<em>Case No. 20: Kiriakos</em>\n</p>\n<p id=\"AgSg\">Common Law Duty</p>\n<p id=\"b507-7\">We granted Kiriakos\u2019s Petition for Writ of Certiorari to address the following questions:</p>\n<blockquote id=\"b508-3\"><page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"476\">*476</page-number>1. Assuming a duty existed, whether the acts of Phillips establish a prima facie claim of negligence under fundamental tort principles?</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b508-4\">2. Whether Maryland should recognize a narrowly tailored definition of social host liability when an adult directly provides massive amounts of alcohol to a teenager when the adult knows the teenager will soon drive?</blockquote>\n<p id=\"b508-5\">Because we answer yes to both questions, we shall reverse.</p>\n<p id=\"b508-6\">Kiriakos sues in common law negligence, asking us to apply \u201ctraditional negligence principles,\u201d and engage in an ordinary duty of care analysis. While acknowledging Maryland has not recognized social host liability to third persons, Kiriakos points to legislation in the State \u201cprotecting minors and the public from the effects of alcohol.\u201d At oral argument she pointed to CR \u00a7 10-117 as a statement of that policy. Focusing on Phillips\u2019s active and knowing misconduct, providing alcohol to an underage person, she sees no need to establish a special relationship with Phillips to support her claim of duty. Distinguishing earlier Maryland cases, Kiriakos sees her action as closer to the theory of negligent entrustment.</p>\n<p id=\"b508-7\">Countering, Phillips avows: \u201clabeling a theory that is <em>clearly </em>social host liability by a different name is still social host liability.\u201d (Emphasis in original.) Relying on two decisions by the Court of Special Appeals,<footnotemark>40</footnotemark> he proclaims Maryland social host liability cases are dispositive in his favor. Likewise, he views our reasoning in <em>Warr v. JMGM Group, LLC, </em>433 Md. 170, 70 A.3d 347 (2013) as foreclosing Kiriakos\u2019s cause of action. Like <em>Warr, </em>Phillips maintains that the proper inquiry is whether he had a special relationship with Robinson that created a duty to control the latter\u2019s actions, to which he answers, resoundingly, no.</p>\n<p id=\"b509-3\">\n<page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"477\">*477</page-number>\n<em>CR \u00a7 10-117(b)</em>\n</p>\n<p id=\"b509-4\">We certainly do not overlook or discount our recent decision in <em>Warr. </em>What critically distinguishes Kiriakos\u2019s claim from the plaintiffs\u2019 in <em>Warr, </em>however, is Robinson\u2019s age and the venue of his intoxication, both reflected in the strong public policy underlying CR \u00a7 10-117(b).<footnotemark>41</footnotemark> This statute, which prohibits adults from allowing underage drinking on their property, represents the General Assembly\u2019s determination that underage persons have a diminished ability to handle alcohol and adults should not facilitate minors\u2019 consumption in the adult\u2019s homes, save the narrow exceptions in the statute. <em>See </em>CR \u00a7 10 \u2014 117(b); <em>see also Martin v. Marciano, </em>871 A.2d 911, 916 (R.I.2005) (\u201cThese statutes demonstrate an overriding policy against not only underage drinking, but also an adult\u2019s provision of alcohol to minors, who, by virtue of their tender age and inexperience, are presumed less capable of handling the deleterious effects of alcohol consumption.\u201d). Thus, just as we did with Dankos, we view underage persons as vulnerable and with diminished ability<footnotemark>42</footnotemark> in the context of drinking alcohol on an adult\u2019s property.<footnotemark>43</footnotemark></p>\n<p id=\"b510-4\"><page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"478\">*478</page-number>Unlike the statute allegedly violated in <em>Wan% </em>an adult only violates CR \u00a7 10 \u2014 117(b), if he \u201cknowingly and willfully allow[s]\u201d<footnotemark>44</footnotemark> an underage person to possess or consume alcohol at his home. CR \u00a7 10-117(b). Because we rely heavily on the public policy set forth in CR \u00a7 10 \u2014 117(b), we view this knowing and willful standard as a predicate for the limited social host cause of action we evaluate today. <em>See Marcum v. Bowden, </em>372 S.C. 452, 643 S.E.2d 85, 86 (2007) (\u201cAn adult social host who knowingly and intentionally serves, or causes to be served, an alcoholic beverage to a person he knows or reasonably should know is between the ages of 18 and 20 is liable to the person served and to any other person for damages proximately resulting from the host\u2019s service of <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"479\">*479</page-number>alcohol.\u201d).<footnotemark>45</footnotemark></p>\n<p id=\"b511-5\">Admittedly, the terms \u201cknowing\u201d and \u201cwillful\u201d are not usually paired with negligence. But nothing prevents us from superimposing this requirement on a cause of action for social host liability sounding in negligence where an integral statute on which the negligence depends makes knowledge and willfulness pivotal for culpability. <em>See Ghassemieh v. Schafer, </em>52 Md.App. 31, 40, 447 A.2d 84 (1982) (noting that \u201cthe presence of an intent to do an act does not preclude negligence\u201d in a case involving the prank of yanking a chair out from under a person about to sit); Keeton et al., <em>supra </em>at \u00a7 34, at 212-13. Professor Keeton explains:</p>\n<blockquote id=\"b511-6\">Lying between intent to do harm, which ... includes proceeding with knowledge that the harm is substantially certain to occur, and the mere unreasonable risk of harm to another involved in ordinary negligence, there is a penumbra of what has been called \u201cquasi-intent.\u201d To this area the words \u201cwillful,\u201d \u201cwanton,\u201d or \u201creckless,\u201d are customarily applied; and sometimes, in a single sentence, all three.... [T]he three terms have been treated as meaning the same thing, or at least as coming out at the same legal exit. They have been grouped together as an aggravated form of negligence, differing in quality rather than in degree from ordinary lack of care..... They apply to conduct which is still, at essence, negligent, rather than actually intended to do harm, but which is so far from a proper state of mind that it is treated in many respects as if it were so intended.</blockquote>\n<p id=\"b512-4\"><page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"480\">*480</page-number>Keeton et al., <em>supra </em>at \u00a7 34, at 212-13 (footnotes omitted). Bearing in mind this \u201cknowing and willful\u201d requirement, we now turn to traditional negligence law to examine the basis from which social host liability to a third party can be formulated.</p>\n<p id=\"b512-5\">\n<em>Negligent Entrustment</em>\n</p>\n<p id=\"b512-6\">The doctrine of negligent entrustment, advanced by Kiriakos,<footnotemark>46</footnotemark> is instructive as to whether Phillips owed Kiriakos, a third party, a duty when he enabled an underage person to consume alcohol on his property, drive away under the influence, and ultimately injure Kiriakos near a public motorway. We first applied the theory of negligent entrustment in <em>Rounds v. Phillips, </em>166 Md. 151, 160-61, 170 A. 532 (1934). In <em>Rounds, </em>William Phillips negligently drove his parents\u2019 car and crashed into a truck Rounds was driving. <em>Id. </em>at 157-58, 170 A. 532. Ruling for the plaintiff, a third party, the Court reasoned that sufficient evidence showed that Phillips\u2019s parents permitted him to drive their car even though they knew or should have known he was an incompetent driver. <em>Id. </em>at 166-67, 169, 170 A. 532.</p>\n<p id=\"b512-7\">The <em>Rounds </em>Court quoted Section 390 of the Restatement (First) of Torts (1934) to describe the tort of negligent entrustment as follows:</p>\n<blockquote id=\"b512-8\">One who supplies directly or through a third person a chattel for the use of another whom the supplier knows or from facts known to him, should know to be likely <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"481\">*481</page-number>because of his youth, inexperience, or otherwise, to use it in a manner involving unreasonable risk of bodily harm to himself and others whom the supplier should expect to share in, or be in the vicinity of its use, is subject to liability for bodily harm caused thereby to them.</blockquote>\n<p id=\"b513-5\"><em>Id. </em>at 160-61, 170 A. 582 (emphasis added.) Discussing an analogy to a tort based on an \u201cinherently dangerous instrumentality,\u201d the <em>Rounds </em>Court reasoned:</p>\n<blockquote id=\"b513-6\">There is ... a logical analogy when a potentially dangerous instrumentality is put into the hands of a reckless and incompetent operator, to be used in proximity to the traveling public. In other words, there is no analogy when the owner of an automobile permits it to be used by one not known to be incompetent and reckless, because under such conditions it is not inherently dangerous; while on the other hand, if he loans his automobile to another who is known to the owner to be habitually reckless and operate an automobile under the influence of liquor, under such conditions the automobile, plus the incompetency of the person to whom it is entrusted, does create an inherently dangerous instrumentality.</blockquote>\n<p id=\"b513-7\"><em>Id. </em>at 163, 170 A. 532. Rounds illustrates that negligent entrustment involves a duty to a third person \u2014 someone injured by the reckless driver. Citing <em>Remsburg v. Montgomery, </em>376 Md. 568, 831 A.2d 18 (2003) and other cases, Phillips argues that we could only And him liable to a third party if there exists a special relationship between Phillips and Robinson or between Phillips and Kiriakos \u2014 such that Phillips had a duty to control Robinson\u2019s conduct.<footnotemark>47</footnotemark> But <em>Rounds </em>shows that <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"482\">*482</page-number>special relationships are not the exclusive means to justify imposition of duty to a third person.</p>\n<p id=\"b514-5\">Other courts have recognized a similarity between negligent entrustment of a car to a youth, as in Rounds,<footnotemark>48</footnotemark> and the alleged circumstances before us, that is, allowing an underage person, who is likely to drive, to consume alcohol. In <em>Estate of Hernandez by Hernandez-Wheeler v. Arizona Board of Regents, </em>177 Ariz. 244, 866 P.2d 1330, 1333 (1994), an underage fraternity member drove from a fraternity party where he had been drinking and caused severe injuries to another driver. The injured driver sued various defendants, including the fraternity and certain members. <em>Id. </em>The Supreme Court of Arizona concluded that furnishing alcohol to underage consumers \u201cviolates well-established common-law principles that recognize a duty to avoid furnishing dangerous items to those known to have diminished capacity to use them safely.\u201d <em>Id. </em>at 1342. One such principle was negligent entrustment. <em>Id. </em>at 1340. After analyzing cases applying this and similar common law principles, the court stated: \u201cWe perceive little difference in principle between liability for giving a car to an intoxicated youth and liability for giving drinks to a youth with a car.\u201d <em>Id. </em>(emphasis added.) The point, the court emphasized, was not whether the item given a youth is \u201ca loaded gun, a car, or alcohol,\u201d but that the item is dangerous, and that the item is given to a \u201crecipient [who] is known to be incompetent to receive [it].\u201d <em>Id. </em>at 1340-41. <em>See also Huston v. Konieczny, 52 </em>Ohio St.3d 214, 556 N.E.2d 505, 509 (1990) (finding relevant, in claim arising from a drunk driving accident, that \u201c[p]arents may incur liability when they negligently entrust their child with an instrumentality (such as a gun or car) which, because of the child\u2019s immaturity or lack of experience, may become a source of danger to others\u201d).</p>\n<p id=\"b515-4\"><page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"483\">*483</page-number>The doctrinal underpinnings of negligent entrustment are also subsumed within a broader tort theory that is set forth in the Restatement (Third) of Torts \u00a7 19. Although we need not adopt Section 19, we find it helpful to illustrate how the theory of negligent entrustment provides a foundation for recognizing the tort of social host liability in the present case. In both the doctrine of negligent entrustment and Section 19, the adult increases the risk of harm to themselves and others by facilitating the improper conduct of another.</p>\n<p id=\"b515-5\">Section 19 of the Restatement (Third) of Torts instructs that \u201c[t]he conduct of a defendant can lack reasonable care insofar as it foreseeably combines with or permits the improper conduct of the plaintiff or a third party.\u201d Restatement (Third) of Torts \u00a7 19 (2010).<footnotemark>49</footnotemark> Comment e describes pertinent cases as those \u201cin which the defendant\u2019s conduct creates or increases the probability of harm caused by third-party misconduct.\u201d <em>Id. </em>\u00a7 19 cmt. e. The illustrations in Section 19 include a classic example of negligent entrustment.<footnotemark>50</footnotemark> They also include providing a child with access to a dangerous <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"484\">*484</page-number>instrument, such as a gun.<footnotemark>51</footnotemark> Restatement (Third) of Torts \u00a7 19 cmt. e, illus. 3. And like the doctrine of negligent entrustment, Section 19 imposes no requirement of a special relationship or control of another\u2019s conduct.<footnotemark>52</footnotemark></p>\n<p id=\"b516-5\">But, Phillips argues, he cannot owe a duty to Kiriakos based on the concept of creating a risk because the Court in <em>Warr </em>disposed of such a theory. He points us to that portion of the <em>Warr </em>opinion in which the Court examined <em>Barclay v. Briscoe, </em>427 Md. 270, 47 A.3d 560 (2012). The reasoning in <em>Barclay, </em>which the Court in <em>Warr </em>approved, derived in part from <em>Hatfield. See Warr, </em>433 Md. at 185 n. 11, 70 A.3d 347.<footnotemark>53</footnotemark> As Phillips reasons, the application of <em>Hatfield </em>to the circumstances in <em>Barclay </em>and <em>Warr </em>respectively is that an employee who works until exhaustion and drives, or a patron who drinks and drives, is \u201cresponsible for his or her own torts.\u201d <em>See Warr, </em>433 Md. at 185 n. 11, 70 A.3d 347. Yet, unlike this case, <em>Barclay </em>involved an adult who chose to drive after working multiple shifts, was allegedly incapacitated by fatigue, and caused an accident. There is no Maryland statute recognizing a state problem with injuries caused by persons driving while overly fatigued and forbidding multiple shifts.<footnotemark>54</footnotemark> <em>Cf. </em>CR \u00a7 10-<page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"485\">*485</page-number>117(b) (reflecting state policy relating to alcohol and underage minors). We cannot emphasize enough that a minor\u2019s decision to drink is not the same as an adult\u2019s.</p>\n<p id=\"b517-5\">Neither are we persuaded by Phillips\u2019s assertion that \u201c[sjerving alcohol to another, even if the other one is 18 years old like Robinson, does not in and of itself guarantee that an injury or death will occur.\u201d Of course, there is no guarantee of injury or death. But tort law deals with risks, not certain outcomes. Keeton et al., <em>supra </em>at \u00a7 31, at 169 (\u201cNegligence is a matter of risk \u2014 that is to say, of recognizable danger of injury. It has been defined as \u2018conduct which involves an unreasonably great risk of causing damage,\u2019 or, more fully, conduct \u2018which falls below the standard established by law for the protection of others against unreasonable risk of harm.\u2019 \u201d). Enabling an underage person to drink alcohol under these circumstances increases the risk of harm, which undergirds the tort of negligent entrustment. <em>See Estate of Hernandez by Hernandez-Wheeler, </em>866 P.2d at 1340-41 (\u201cIf the recipient is known to be incompetent to receive the dangerous instrument, it is irrelevant whether it is a loaded gun, a car, or alcohol.\u201d); Dan B. Dobbs et al., The Law of Torts \u00a7 424, at 776 (2d ed. 2011) (\u201c[T]he injured stranger is not a participant in the intoxication, only a victim, and for that reason might seem especially worthy of protection from the host\u2019s negligence.\u201d); Nat\u2019l Inst, on Alcohol Abuse and Alcoholism, Underage Drinking: Fact Sheet at 1 (2016), <em>available at </em>http://pubs. niaaa.nih.gov/publicationsAJnderageDrinking/Underage_Fact. pdf [https://perma.cc/UT66-KNEJ] (\u201cAlcohol is the most widely used substance of abuse among America\u2019s youth, and drink<page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"486\">*486</page-number>ing by young people poses enormous health and safety risks.\u201d).</p>\n<p id=\"b518-5\">For the reasons stated above, we conclude that Kiriakos can maintain a limited social host cause of action against Phillips through common law tort principles, like negligent entrustment, based on the strong public policy evident in CR \u00a7 10-117(b). To the extent that the Court of Special Appeals decisions in <em>Hebb </em>or <em>Wright </em>are inconsistent with this conclusion, we overrule them.</p>\n<p id=\"b518-6\">Our decision is consonant with the classic factors we use to decide questions of duty under the common law:</p>\n<blockquote id=\"b518-7\">the foreseeability of harm to the plaintiff, the degree of certainty that the plaintiff suffered the injury, the closeness of the connection between the defendant\u2019s conduct and the injury suffered, the moral blame attached to the defendant\u2019s conduct, the policy of preventing future harm, the extent of the burden to the defendant and consequences to the community of imposing a duty to exercise reasonable care with resulting liability for breach, and the availability, cost and prevalence of insurance for the risk involved.</blockquote>\n<p id=\"b518-8\"><em>Ashburn v.

Although foreseeability is perhaps \u201cmost important\u201d among these factors, it alone does not justify the imposition of a duty. <em>Ashburn, </em>306 Md. at 628, 510 A.2d 1078.

H.B. 299, Fiscal &amp; Policy Note, 2009 Reg. Sess., at 5 (\u201cAccording to the U.S. Department of Transportation, alcohol-impaired driving is one of the nation\u2019s deadliest crimes.\u201d). This history also shows that underage drunk driving poses an equal if not greater public threat. <em>See id. </em>(explaining that, among all fatally injured alcohol-impaired drivers, the percentage of such drivers aged 16 to 20 \u201chas hovered around 25%\u201d since 1995).</p>\n<p id=\"b519-5\">It is alleged that Phillips served Robinson alcohol, enough so that Phillips had two conversations with him about the extent of his drinking.<footnotemark>56</footnotemark> Phillips knew that Robinson, who had driven to Phillips\u2019s house, likely was going to be driving after their get-together, especially when Robinson declined an invitation to stay at Phillips\u2019s house. Robinson left about an hour after refusing the invitation, and the accident occurred another hour later. Robinson struck Kiriakos, a pedestrian, while driving under the influence. The officer at the scene smelled \u201ca strong odor\u201d of alcohol on Robinson\u2019s breath and \u201cnoticed that his eyes were bloodshot.\u201d Robinson\u2019s blood alcohol content measured at .088.<footnotemark>57</footnotemark></p>\n<p id=\"b519-6\">Based on these allegations, and the universally understood risk of harm that underage drunk driving poses to the traveling public, Kiriakos\u2019s injuries were foreseeable. We disagree with Phillips that it is a \u201cleap\u201d to make this conclusion.</p>\n<p id=\"b520-4\">\n<page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"488\">*488</page-number>\n<em>(ii) Degree of Certainty that the Plaintiff Suffered the Injury</em>\n</p>\n<p id=\"b520-5\">Robinson pleaded guilty to \u201ccausing life-threatening injuries to\u201d Kiriakos because he drove under the influence, and he reiterated in his deposition that his actions caused her injuries. This factor favors civil liability.</p>\n<p id=\"b520-6\">\n<em>(Hi) Closeness of the Connection Between Defendant\u2019s Conduct and the Injury Suffered</em>\n</p>\n<p id=\"b520-7\">This factor is like a \u201cproximate cause element\u201d in that \u201c[cjonsideration is given to whether, across the universe of cases of the type presented, there would ordinarily be so little connection between breach of the duty contended for, and the allegedly resulting harm, that a court would simply foreclose liability by holding that there is no duty.\u201d Eisel, 324 Md. at 389, 597 A.2d 447. <em>Hatfield, </em>197 Md. at 254, 78 A.2d 754, established a long-standing rule that the \u201claw (apart from statute) recognizes no relation of proximate cause between a sale of liquor and a tort committed by a buyer who has drunk the liquor\u201d because people, \u201cdrunk or sober, are responsible for their own torts.\u201d But this rule does not extend to the circumstances here \u2014 an underage person consuming alcohol on the adult\u2019s property with the adult\u2019s complicity. Considering the legislative recognition in Maryland that underage people have a diminished ability to handle alcohol and may expose themselves and others to harm, there is a sufficient connection between Phillips\u2019s conduct and the harm to Kiriakos such that we will not foreclose liability.</p>\n<p id=\"b520-8\">The nature of the risk at issue is also relevant here. We explained in <em>Jacques v. First National Bank of Maryland, </em>307 Md. 527, 537, 515 A.2d 756 (1986) that, \u201c[a]s the magnitude of the risk increases, the requirement of privity is relaxed \u2014 thus justifying the imposition of a duty in favor of a large class of persons where the risk is of death or personal injury.\u201d Here, where the risk is death or personal injury, a close connection between Phillips and Kiriakos is not required. This factor favors civil liability.</p>\n<p id=\"b521-4\">\n<page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"489\">*489</page-number>\n<em>(iv) Moral Blame Attached to the Defendant\u2019s Conduct</em>\n</p>\n<p id=\"b521-5\">Under this factor, our standard is not evidence of \u201cintent to cause harm.\u201d <em>Eisel, </em>324 Md. at 390, 597 A.2d 447. Rather, we consider \u201cthe reaction of persons in general to the circumstances.\u201d <em>Id. </em>at 390-91, 597 A.2d 447.</p>\n<p id=\"b521-6\">In <em>Eisel, </em>the Court considered whether to impose a duty on school counselors \u201cto attempt to prevent an adolescent\u2019s suicide, by reasonable means, including, in [that] case, by warning the parent.\u201d<footnotemark>58</footnotemark> <em>Id. </em>at 385, 597 A.2d 447. In holding that the counselors had such a duty, the Court explained that legislation requiring \u201cyouth suicide prevention programs\u201d to raise awareness about \u201cemotional warning signs\u201d showed \u201ca community sense that there should be intervention based on emotional indicia of suicide.\u201d <em>Id. </em>at 391, 393, 597 A.2d 447.</p>\n<p id=\"b521-7\">Here, the General Assembly has created law to hold <em>adults responsible </em>for underage drinking on their property because of the risks associated with underage drinking. <em>See </em>CR \u00a7 10-117(b). We underscore that what is blameworthy here is not merely that an underage person drinks alcohol on an adult\u2019s property, but that, as stated in CR \u00a7 10 \u2014 117(b), the adult <em>\u201cknowingly and willfully </em>allow[s] an individual under the age of 21 years actually to possess or consume an alcoholic beverage at [the adult\u2019s] residence, or within the curtilage\u201d thereof. CR \u00a7 10 \u2014 117(b) (emphasis added).</p>\n<p id=\"b521-8\">Because Phillips allegedly not only permitted but facilitated Robinson\u2019s drinking on his property to the point of intoxication, we conclude that the general public would consider Phillips\u2019s conduct blameworthy. Again, this factor favors liability.</p>\n<p id=\"b522-3\">\n<page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"490\">*490</page-number>\n<em>(v) The Policy of Preventing Future Harm</em>\n</p>\n<p id=\"b522-4\">As we noted in <em>Matthews v. Amberwood Associates Ltd. Partnership, Inc., </em>351 Md. 544, 570, 719 A.2d 119 (1998):</p>\n<blockquote id=\"A_s\">The \u2018prophylactic\u2019 factor of preventing future harm has been quite important in the field of torts. The courts are concerned not only with the compensation of the victim, but with admonition of the wrongdoer. When the decisions of the courts become known, and defendants realize that they may be held liable, there is of course a strong incentive to prevent the occurrence of the harm. Not infrequently one reason for imposing liability is the deliberate purpose of providing that incentive.</blockquote>\n<p id=\"b522-5\">(Quoting Keeton et al., <em>supra </em>at \u00a7 4, at 25-26).</p>\n<p id=\"b522-6\">Examining this factor in <em>Eisel, </em>324 Md. at 387, 597 A.2d 447, we noted that pertinent legislation \u201cmade it quite clear that prevention of youth suicide is an important public policy, and that local schools should be at the forefront of the prevention effort.\u201d We concluded that a duty \u201cto prevent suicides when [school counselors] have evidence of a suicidal intent comports with the policy underlying this Act.\u201d <em>Id. </em>at 389, 597 A.2d 447.</p>\n<p id=\"b522-7\">The General Assembly\u2019s decision to punish adults who furnish alcohol to underage persons or otherwise tolerate it, occurred in the wake of a report to combat drunk driving, and statistics attesting to the pervasive dangers of drunk driving. It is transparent that this legislative action and the impetus for it provide a \u201cstrong incentive to prevent the occurrence of the harm\u201d that befell a victim like Kiriakos. <em>See Matthews, </em>351 Md. at 570, 719 A.2d 119 (quoting Keeton et al., <em>supra </em>at \u00a7 4, at 25-26); <em>cf. </em>CR \u00a7 10-121(b). Consideration of this policy thus favors liability.</p>\n<p id=\"b522-8\">\n<em>(vi) Extent of the Burden on the Defendant and Consequences to the Community of Imposing a Duty</em>\n</p>\n<p id=\"b522-10\">In <em>Eisel, </em>the Court concluded that the risk of harm greatly outweighed the extent of the burden to the defendant. <em>See Eisel, </em>324 Md. at 391-92, 597 A.2d 447. \u201c[T]he consequence of <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"491\">*491</page-number>the risk [of teenage suicide] is so great that even a relatively remote possibility of a suicide may be enough to establish duty.\u201d <em>Id. </em>at 391, 597 A.2d 447. The consequences of underage drinking are great \u2014 such that the burden on Phillips of denying youths access to alcohol hardly warrants discussion.<footnotemark>59</footnotemark></p>\n<p id=\"b523-5\">The conduct at issue in <em>Warr, </em>433 Md. at 175, 70 A.3d 347, provides an instructive contrast. The allegations in <em>Warr </em>were that the tavern served alcohol to an adult who was \u201cvisibly intoxicated,\u201d an act prohibited by law. The point at which a patron becomes \u201cvisibly intoxicated\u201d is a point about which reasonable minds could differ. When an underage person such as Robinson steps foot on Phillips\u2019s property, however, reasonable minds cannot differ as to what Phillips must do in light of CR \u00a7 10-117. Phillips cannot allow Robinson, a person he knew to be underage, to drink on his property. This prohibition serves as a bright line.<footnotemark>60</footnotemark> The burden on Phillips was not great \u2014 he could have easily conformed his conduct to the law by refraining from furnishing alcohol to Robinson.</p>\n<p id=\"b523-6\">This factor also favors imposition of liability.</p>\n<p id=\"b524-3\">\n<page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"492\">*492</page-number>\n<em>(vii) Cost and Prevalence of Insurance for the Risk Involved</em>\n</p>\n<p id=\"b524-4\">Kiriakos avers that \u201c[t]here is affordable insurance, available to every homeowner or renter, which would protect a defendant\u2019s personal assets in the event the defendant injured a third party by serving alcohol to an underage person.\u201d But Kiriakos does not point to any evidence in the record to support her assertion. In the absence of such information, will not address the seventh factor.</p>\n<p id=\"b524-5\">Reviewing the six favorable factors, we deduce that this seven-pronged test supports our conclusion that a cognizable duty was adequately alleged.</p>\n<p id=\"b524-6\">Proximate Cause</p>\n<p id=\"b524-7\">Our two-step inquiry in determining proximate cause is whether Phillips\u2019s negligence was a \u201c1) a cause in fact, and 2) a legally cognizable cause\u201d of Kiriakos\u2019s injuries. <em>Pittway Corp. v. Collins, </em>409 Md. 218, 243-46, 973 A.2d 771 (2009). Phillips focuses his proximate cause argument on the second prong \u2014 legal causation.</p>\n<p id=\"b524-8\">Phillips contends that Kiriakos cannot establish proximate cause because the critical event was Robinson\u2019s decision to drink. He avers that \u201cresponsibility rests on the individual who chooses to drink.\u201d (Quoting <em>Wright, </em>131 Md.App. at 476, 749 A.2d 241 (discussing <em>Hatfield)). </em>This plows already plowed ground. As we have said CR \u00a7 10-117(b) allocates legal responsibility to the adult who permits an underage person to drink alcohol on an adult\u2019s property.<footnotemark>61</footnotemark> Suffice it to say that Robinson\u2019s decision to drink does not disrupt the causal chain and thereby destroy Kiriakos\u2019s claim against Phillips. <em>See, e.g., Ely v. Murphy, </em>207 Conn. 88, 540 A.2d 54, <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"493\">*493</page-number>58 (1988) (\u201c[L]ogic dictates that their [minors\u2019] consumption of alcohol does not, as a matter of law, constitute the intervening act necessary to break the chain of proximate causation and does not, as a matter of law, insulate one who provides alcohol to minors from liability for ensuing injury.\u201d).</p>\n<p id=\"b525-5\">\n<em>Causation-in-Fact</em>\n</p>\n<p id=\"b525-6\">As we earlier discussed, when an injury arises from \u201ctwo or more independent negligent acts,\u201d as it does here, we apply the substantial factor test. <em>Pittway, </em>409 at 244, 973 A.2d 771. That is, we must determine whether \u201cit is \u2018more likely than not\u2019 that the defendant\u2019s conduct was a substantial factor in producing the injuries.\u201d <em>Id. </em>We earlier discussed the criteria for a substantial factor inquiry. <em>See </em>Restatement (Second) of Torts <em>supra.</em></p>\n<p id=\"b525-7\">The police officer concluded that Robinson\u2019s \u201cblood alcohol level and lack of sleep caused him to not be able to control his vehicle in a safe manner.\u201d Robinson began drinking around eight hours earlier when Phillips provided vodka and champagne.<footnotemark>62</footnotemark> Phillips admitted Robinson \u201cdr[a]nk a little too much\u201d and was concerned about him driving home. These facts, if proven, could lead a reasonable jury to conclude that Phillips\u2019s provision of alcohol to Robinson \u201ccreated a force or series of forces which [we]re in continuous and active operation up to the time\u201d Robinson injured Kiriakos. <em>Pittway, </em>409 Md. at 245, 973 A.2d 771 (quoting Section 433 of the Restatement (Second) of Torts). Thus, a jury could conclude that \u201cit is \u2018more likely than not\u2019 \u201d that Phillips\u2019s conduct was a substantial factor in producing Kiriakos\u2019s injuries. <em>Id. </em>at 244, 973 A.2d 771.</p>\n<p id=\"b525-8\">\n<em>Legal Causation</em>\n</p>\n<p id=\"b525-9\">Legal causation is an inquiry into \u201cwhether the actual harm to a litigant falls within a general field of danger that the actor should have anticipated or expected.\u201d <em>Pittway, </em>409 <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"494\">*494</page-number>Md. at 245, 973 A.2d 771. We, then, are primarily concerned with whether the harm to Kiriakos was foreseeable by Phillips. <em>Id. </em>at 246, 973 A.2d 771. This analysis overlaps with our inquiry into duty, <em>supra, </em>in which we concluded that the harm to Kiriakos from Phillips\u2019s conduct was foreseeable.</p>\n<p id=\"b526-5\">Here, there are multiple instances of alleged negligent conduct, including Robinson\u2019s negligence in driving under the influence. Our inquiry then is \u201cwhether a negligent defendant is relieved from liability by intervening negligent acts or omissions.\u201d <em>Id. </em>at 247, 973 A.2d 771. If Robinson\u2019s intervening negligent act is unusual and extraordinary such that Phillips \u201ccould not have anticipated\u201d the intervening act, then the act is a superseding cause, and Phillips, as the original tortfeasor, may not be liable. <em>Id. </em>at 247, 249, 973 A.2d 771.<footnotemark>63</footnotemark> (pbat is a jury question. <em>See Balt. Gas &amp; Elec. Co. v. Lane, </em>338 Md. 34, 52-53, 656 A.2d 307 (1995) (\u201cThis foreseeability inquiry [on the issue of intervening-superseding causation] is ordinarily a question of fact to be decided by the finder of fact.\u201d) (citation omitted), <em>overruled on other grounds by Balt. Gas &amp; Elec. Co. v. Flippo, </em>348 Md. 680, 705 A.2d 1144 (1998).</p>\n<p id=\"b526-6\">If the evidence supported the allegations, a reasonable jury could conclude: (1) Kiriakos\u2019s injuries were a result of Robinson\u2019s drunk driving; (2) Phillips could have anticipated Robinson\u2019s negligent act because both Robinson\u2019s substantial consumption of alcohol and the likelihood of his driving were apparent to Phillips; and (3) the accident occurred within an hour after Robinson left Phillips\u2019s house. These conclusions, if made by the jury, would render Phillips\u2019s conduct a legal cause of Kiriakos\u2019s injuries.<footnotemark>64</footnotemark></p>\n<p id=\"b527-3\"><page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"495\">*495</page-number>CONCLUSION FOR CASES 20 AND 55</p>\n<p id=\"b527-4\">Subject to exceptions noted in the statute, adults are responsible criminally for underage drinking on their property. CR \u00a7 10-117. Depending on the circumstances, an adult who violates this statute may owe a civil duty to persons injured as a result of such drinking, including the underage persons consuming the alcohol. Phillips owed Kiriakos such a duty, as Stapf had a duty with respect to Dankos. The Circuit Court erred in granting the defendants\u2019 motions.</p>\n<p id=\"b527-5\">Although the reasoning differs in the two cases, the public policy underlying CR \u00a7 10 \u2014 117(b) applies to both cases. That is, underage persons are not solely responsible for drinking alcohol on an adult\u2019s property because they are not competent to handle the effects of this potentially dangerous substance. Because of the public policy evident in CR \u00a7 10-117(b), Stapf and Phillips cannot avail themselves of the adage in <em>Hatfield </em>that a person\u2019s decision to drink is the sole cause of injuries arising from his intoxication. <em>See Hatfield, </em>197 Md. at 254, 78 A.2d 754.</p>\n<p id=\"b527-6\">JUDGMENT OF THE COURT OF SPECIAL APPEALS REVERSED.

SeeCR\u00a7 10-117; <em>see also Martin v. Marciano, </em>871 A.2d 911, 916 (R.I.2005) (\"To avoid assuming a duty of protection, the adult property owner must simply comply with existing law and refuse to provide alcohol or condone underage drinking on his or her property.\u201d).</p>\n</footnote>\n<footnote label=\"61\">\n<p id=\"b524-9\">. With respect to Robinson\u2019s age, Phillips says that he \"may be considered a \u2018minor\u2019 in reference to drinking alcohol,\u201d but that Robinson \"was adult of age\u201d because he could, among other things, marry and vote. The General Assembly, in enacting CR \u00a7 10-117, did not address rights and privileges available and unavailable to Robinson. Neither shall we.</p>\n</footnote>\n<footnote label=\"62\">\n<p id=\"b525-10\">. There is no contention that Robinson was drinking alcohol before the get-together; indeed, Robinson was in Phillips's company for nearly five hours working on their music before they began drinking.</p>\n</footnote>\n<footnote label=\"63\">\n<p id=\"b526-7\">. The intervening-superseding act inquiry renders beside the point Phillips's argument that \"Robinson, not [] Phillips, got behind the wheel of his motor vehicle and struck [Kiriakos].\u201d The original tortfeasor does not avoid liability just because a subsequent negligent event occurs. Phillips does not explain why Robinson's negligent act of driving (under the influence) was unusual or extraordinary.</p>\n</footnote>\n<footnote label=\"64\">\n<p id=\"b526-8\">. On quite similar facts, the Superior Court of New Jersey, Appellate Division explained:</p>\n<blockquote id=\"b527-7\"><page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"495\">*495</page-number>[A] jury might well determine that a social host who serves excessive amounts of alcoholic beverages to a visibly intoxicated minor, knowing the minor was about to drive a car on the public highways, could reasonably foresee or anticipate an accident or injury as a reasonably foreseeable consequence of his negligence in serving the minor. This becomes devastatingly apparent in view of the ever-increasing incidence of serious automobile accidents resulting from drunken driving.</blockquote>\n<p id=\"b527-8\"><em>Linn v.
