The district court had jurisdiction under 28 U.S.C. \u00a7 2254. We have jurisdiction of this timely filed appeal pursuant to 28 U.S.C. \u00a7 2253. We affirm.</p>\n<p id=\"b600-26\">We review this denial of a petition for habeas corpus de novo, but findings of fact made by the district court relevant to the denial are reviewed for clear error. <em>Bonin v. Calderon, </em>59 F.3d 815, 823 (9th Cir. 1995). We granted a certificate of appeal-ability as to two of the issues raised by Alen. <em>See Slack v. McDaniel, </em>529 U.S. 473, 482-83, 120 S.Ct. 1595, 146 L.Ed.2d 542.</p>\n<p id=\"b600-27\">First, Alen asserts that his second trial, which was necessitated by a mistrial in the first proceeding, violated the constitutional prohibition against double jeopardy. We review this issue de novo. <em>Weston v. Kernan, </em>50 F.3d 633, 636 (9th Cir. <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"577\">*577</page-number>1995). Retrial is \u201cpermitted if the defendant consented to the mistrial.\u201d <em>Id. </em>Consent may be implied where \u201c[d]efense counsel did not object to the order of mistrial, despite adequate opportunity to do so.\u201d <em>United States v. Smith, </em>621 F.2d 350, 352 (9th Cir.1980). Here, the record demonstrates that there was \u201cadequate opportunity\u201d for Allen\u2019s counsel to object. We hold that Allen was not placed in double jeopardy.</p>\n<p id=\"b601-5\">The second issue before us is Allen\u2019s assertion that he was denied his Sixth Amendment right of self-representation. \u201c[W]e have not yet clarified whether denial of a <em>Faretta </em>request is reviewed de novo or for abuse of discretion.\u201d <em>United States v. Kaczynski, </em>239 F.3d 1108, 1116 (9th Cir. 2001). We decide, however, that under either standard, Allen\u2019s right to self-representation was not violated.</p>\n<p id=\"b601-6\">Resolution of this issue turns on whether Allen\u2019s request was \u201cequivocal,\u201d the result of \u201cmomentary caprice.\u201d <em>Jackson v. Ylst, </em>921 F.2d 882, 888 (9th Cir.1990). In <em>Jackson v. Ylst, </em>the defendant\u2019s request for self-representation immediately followed the court\u2019s denial of new counsel and was an impulsive, emotional outburst to which the trial judge made no <em>Faretta </em>inquiry. <em>See United States v. Hernandez, </em>203 F.3d 614, 622 n.11 (9th Cir.2000). Because the circumstances of Allen\u2019s request for self-representation are virtually identical to those in <em>Jackson, </em>we hold that Allen\u2019s request was \u201cequivocal.\u201d</p>\n<p id=\"b601-7\">AFFIRMED.</p>\n<footnote label=\"*\">\n<p id=\"b600-18\"> This disposition is not appropriate for publication and may not be cited to or by the courts of this circuit except as may be provided by Ninth Circuit Rule 36-3.</p>\n</footnote>\n</opinion>\n</casebody>\n",
