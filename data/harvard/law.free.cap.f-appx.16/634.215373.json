Following two bench trials, the district court dismissed the claims of all plaintiff Officers with prejudice. The Officers now appeal the district court\u2019s application of the FLSA overtime provisions, 29 U.S.C.A. \u00a7 207. We affirm the district court\u2019s dismissal.</p>\n<p id=\"b659-22\">As a preliminary matter, we note that the Officers\u2019 brief challenged virtually none of the district court\u2019s findings of fact for clear error. These findings of fact included conclusions that most contested activities take \u201ca few seconds\u201d to perform or were expected to be performed during the Officers\u2019 paid shifts and that the testimony of the Officers \u201cwas not believable.\u201d Even assuming that the district court\u2019s findings were implicitly challenged through the Officers\u2019 many legal challenges, they have not shown that the district court committed clear error in making these findings. The Officers therefore failed to establish \u201cas a matter of just and <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"636\">*636</page-number>reasonable inference,\u201d <em>Anderson v. Mt. Clemens Pottery Co., </em>328 U.S. 680, 687, 66 S.Ct. 1187, 90 L.Ed. 1515 (1946), the amount and extent of any extra-shift work performed, which was their burden to do before the district court could shift the burden to the City to account for inaccurate record keeping.</p>\n<p id=\"b660-4\">The remaining issues in the case are controlled by our decisions in <em>Lindow v. United States, </em>738 F.2d 1057, 1060-64 (9th Cir.1984), <em>Berry v. County of Sonoma, </em>30 F.3d 1174, 1180-82 (9th Cir.1994), and <em>Adair v. City of Kirkland, </em>185 F.3d 1055, 1059-62 (9th Cir.1999).</p>\n<p id=\"b660-5\">The judgment of the district court is AFFIRMED.</p>\n<footnote label=\"*\">\n<p id=\"b659-16\"> This disposition is not appropriate for publication and may not be cited to or by the courts of this circuit except as may be provided by 9th Cir.
