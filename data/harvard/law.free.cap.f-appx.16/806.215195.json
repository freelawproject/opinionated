We have jurisdiction over this appeal pursuant to 28 U.S.C. \u00a7 1291. We review the district court\u2019s grant of summary judgment de novo, <em>Weiner v. San Diego County, </em>210 F.3d 1025, 1028 (9th Cir.2000), and we affirm.</p>\n<p id=\"b831-12\">Summary judgment on Snyder\u2019s breach of contract claim was proper because none of the employment rules that Defendants allegedly violated contains \u201cpromises that the employer will provide the employee specific treatment under specific circumstances or in specific situations.\u201d <em>Drobny v. Boeing Co., </em>80 Wash.App. 97, 907 P.2d 299, 302 (Wash.Ct.App.1995). Moreover, there is no evidence that any of the rules were violated.</p>\n<p id=\"b831-15\">Snyder\u2019s claim for wrongful termination in violation of public policy was never presented to the district court. \u201cIt is well-established that an appellate court will not consider issues that were not properly raised before the district court.\u201d <em>Slaven v. Am. Trading Trans. Co., </em>146 F.3d 1066, 1069 (9th Cir.1998). Because Snyder never presented his claim for wrongful termination in violation of public policy to the district court, we will not consider it.</p>\n<p id=\"b831-16\">In their briefs, Defendants argue that the district court erred in partially granting Snyder\u2019s motion for reconsideration of the summary judgment ruling, and they request relief from this court. We cannot grant their request, however, because the district court\u2019s ruling on Snyder\u2019s motion for reconsideration was never appealed by any party. <em>See </em>Fed. R.App. P. 3(a)(1).</p>\n<p id=\"b831-17\">The judgment of the district court is</p>\n<p id=\"b831-18\">AFFIRMED.</p>\n<footnote label=\"*\">\n<p id=\"b831-13\"> This disposition is not appropriate for publication and may not be cited to or by the courts of this circuit except as provided by Ninth Cir.
