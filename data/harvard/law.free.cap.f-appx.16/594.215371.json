We have jurisdiction pursuant to 28 U.S.C. \u00a7\u00a7 1291 <em>&amp; </em>2253 and we AFFIRM. Because the parties are familiar with the factual and procedural history of the case, we do not recount it here except as necessary to explain our decision.</p>\n<p id=\"b618-19\">Williams argues that he was denied effective assistance of counsel as a result of his trial attorney\u2019s failure to adequately investigate and provide witnesses who may have provided an alibi. To establish a prima facie claim of ineffective assistance of counsel, Williams bears the burden of establishing both that his counsel\u2019s performance was deficient and that the deficient performance prejudiced the defense. <em>See United States v. Quintero-Barraza, </em>78 F.3d 1344, 1348 (9th Cir.1995), <em>cert. denied, </em>519 U.S. 848, 117 S.Ct. 135, 136 L.Ed.2d 83 (1996).</p>\n<p id=\"b618-20\">There exists a \u201cstrong presumption that counsel \u2018rendered adequate assistance and made all significant decisions in the exercise of reasonable professional judgment.\u2019 \u201d <em>United States v. Palomba, </em>31 F.3d 1456, 1460 (9th Cir.1994) (quoting <em>Strickland v. Washington, </em>466 U.S. 668, 690, 104 S.Ct. 2052, 2066, 80 L.Ed.2d 674 (1984)). The defendant must surmount the presumption that, \u201cunder the circumstances, the challenged action \u2018might be considered sound trial strategy.\u2019 \u201d <em>Quintero-Barraza, </em>78 F.3d at 1348. Williams\u2019 counsel made a <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"595\">*595</page-number>reasonable tactical decision with regard to the alleged alibi. After his investigation, counsel made a determination that the potential alibi witnesses would not be helpful to the defense because their statements contradicted Williams\u2019 story. Thus, Williams\u2019 reliance on <em>Brown v. Myers, </em>137 F.3d 1154 (9th Cir.1998) where we determined that counsel was ineffective in part because the defendant\u2019s testimony \u201ccoincided in important respects with those of his alibi witnesses\u201d is misplaced. Rather than coinciding in important aspects, according to his trial counsel, Williams\u2019 statements to his attorney were at odds with the statements made by potential witnesses, and Williams\u2019 story kept changing.</p>\n<p id=\"b619-5\">We agree with the district court that Williams has failed to establish deficient performance and prejudice. Accordingly, the state courts\u2019 denial of this claim is neither contrary to, nor an unreasonable application of, clearly established law as determined by the United States Supreme Court and, thus, does not support federal habeas relief. <em>See Weighall v. Middle, </em>215 F.3d 1058, 1062 (9th Cir.2000).<footnotemark>1</footnotemark></p>\n<p id=\"b619-6\">AFFIRMED.</p>\n<footnote label=\"**\">\n<p id=\"b618-21\"> This disposition is not appropriate for publication and may not be cited to or by the courts of this circuit except as may be provided by 9 th Cir.
