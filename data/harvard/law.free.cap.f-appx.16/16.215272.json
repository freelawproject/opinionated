We review the district court\u2019s grant of summary judgment de novo. <em>Manarite v. City of Springfield, </em>957 F.2d 953, 955 (1st Cir.), <em>cert. denied, </em>506 U.S. 837, 113 S.Ct. 113, 121 L.Ed.2d 70 (1992). Upon review of the parties\u2019 briefs and the record on appeal, we affirm the district court judgment, essentially for the reasons stated in the district court\u2019s memorandum and order, dated March 28, 2000.<footnotemark>1</footnotemark></p>\n<p id=\"b40-23\">Apart from his appellate brief, French has filed a motion asking for leave to file a \u201csupplemental exhibit.\u201d Our review is confined to the record on appeal and we do not ordinarily consider material that was not presented to the court below. <em>See </em>Fed. R.App. P. 10(a). The motion is, therefore, denied. We add that, in any event, consideration of that exhibit would not affect the outcome of this appeal.</p>\n<p id=\"b40-24\">\n<em>The judgment of the district court is affirmed.</em>\n</p>\n<footnote label=\"1\">\n<p id=\"b40-20\">. We <em>grant </em>the motion of defendant-appellee Tim Hall for leave to join the brief filed by his co-defendants-appellees.</p>\n</footnote>\n</opinion>\n</casebody>\n",
