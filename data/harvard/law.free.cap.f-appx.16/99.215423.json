Butler was sentenced to a term of twenty-one months imprisonment. Edwards received a sentence of fifteen months imprisonment. In this appeal, Butler contests the three-level adjustment he received under <em>U.S. Sentencing Guidelines Manual </em>\u00a7 3B1.1(b) (2000), for being a manager or supervisor, and Edwards challenges the extent of the district court\u2019s departure for substantial assistance in her case. We affirm Butler\u2019s and Edwards\u2019 sentences.<footnotemark>*</footnotemark></p>\n<p id=\"b124-6\">Between September and December 1998, while Edwards was working as a customer assistance specialist with Equifax, a credit reporting agency in Atlanta, Georgia, Butler supplied her with the names, addresses, and Social Security numbers of persons who wanted to improve their credit ratings. Edwards then removed negative information from the files and added favorable credit information. Butler obtained the information he supplied to Edwards from Alvarado -Clarke, who lived in Charlotte, North Carolina, and represented himself as a \u201ccredit doctor\u201d who could help people improve their credit standing. Clarke paid Butler about $500 for each file that was altered. Edwards and Clarke apparently did not know each other and never met. Edwards initially admitted that Butler and she split the $500 payments from Clarke equally. Later, she testified at a co-defendant\u2019s trial that she received no money from Butler. At her sentencing, her lawyer represented that she had received less than $1000.</p>\n<p id=\"b124-8\">While the conspiracy continued, Edwards altered approximately sixty Equifax files. With their credit thus \u201ccleansed,\u201d a number of co-defendants bought expensive houses and vehicles on credit. As a result, creditors in North Carolina and Georgia extended or approved approximately $1.1 million in credit to the co-conspirators and others whose files were altered.</p>\n<p id=\"b124-9\">Butler objected to the probation officer\u2019s suggestion that he managed or supervised Edwards, arguing that he \u201cmerely acted as a go-between.\u201d The district court found that Butler was actually a leader in the offense because he was a \u201ccrucial link in the organization,\u201d and his participation made it successful. However, the court decided not to increase the adjustment to four levels, <em>see </em>USSG \u00a7 3Bl.l(a), and instead accepted the probation officer\u2019s recommendation for a three-level adjustment under \u00a7 3Bl.l(b).</p>\n<p id=\"b124-10\">On appeal, Butler maintains that the district court erred in making no specific findings of fact to support the manager or supervisor adjustment and, in particular, in not explaining what acts Butler performed that were managerial. The district court\u2019s finding was indeed brief, but adequate to set out its reasons for finding that Butler had an aggravated role. That the court did not focus on Butler\u2019s supervisory or managerial conduct is understandable in light of the fact that the district court actually found that Butler was a leader in the offense, not a manager or supervisor.</p>\n<p id=\"b124-11\">A sentencing court\u2019s determination of the defendant\u2019s role in-the offense is a factual finding reviewed for clear error. <em>United States v. Perkins, </em>108 F.3d 512, 518 (4th Cir.1997). If the district court did not clearly err in finding that Butler was a leader in the offense, then we may affirm its decision to give him a lesser adjust<page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"101\">*101</page-number>ment \u2014 in effect, a one-level downward departure.</p>\n<p id=\"b125-5\">Application Note 4 to \u00a7 4B1.1 lists a number of factors that the court should consider in distinguishing a leadership role from one of management or supervision. Among them are the nature of participation in the commission of the offense and the degree of participation in planning or organizing the offense. The district court stated several times that it considered Butler to have had a pivotal role in the offense, and that the conspiracy could not have gone forward without him because he provided the link between Edwards, who was capable of altering credit files, and Clarke, who found customers willing to pay for this service. Although Butler\u2019s attorney argued that he was expendable because Edwards and Clarke could have dealt directly with each other, in fact they were connected only through Butler. On these facts, we find that the district court did not clearly err in finding that Butler was a leader in the offense. Thus, because a four-level adjustment would not have been clear error, the lesser adjustment was not clear error. The district court effectively departed downward by one level.</p>\n<p id=\"b125-6\">In Edwards\u2019 case, although the government recommended a four-level departure under USSG \u00a7 5K1.1, p.s. based on her substantial assistance, the district court departed by only two offense levels, finding that the lesser departure was more appropriate because Edwards was the person who actually altered the credit files at Equifax. Edwards contends that the court erred by considering her culpability in determining how far to depart. Edwards, however, failed to object to this asserted error in the district court. Accordingly, our review is for plain error. <em>See United States v. Olano, </em>507 U.S. 725, 113 S.Ct. 1770, 123 L.Ed.2d 508 (1993). We cannot find any plain error affecting Edwards\u2019 substantial rights, which seriously affects the fairness, integrity or public reputation of the judicial process. <em>See id. </em>at 731-32, 113 S.Ct. 1770.</p>\n<p id=\"b125-8\">We therefore affirm Butler\u2019s and Edwards\u2019 sentences. We dispense with oral argument because the facts and legal contentions are adequately presented in the materials before the court and argument would not aid the decisional process.</p>\n<p id=\"b125-9\">\n<em>AFFIRMED.</em>\n</p>\n<footnote label=\"*\">\n<p id=\"b124-7\"> We grant Appellants' motion to correct their brief.</p>\n</footnote>\n</opinion>\n</casebody>\n",
