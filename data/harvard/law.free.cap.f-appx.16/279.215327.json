On appeal, Somers alleges that the evidence was insufficient to sustain the finding of guilt. Finding no reversible error, we affirm.</p>\n<p id=\"b303-22\">On direct appeal of a criminal conviction, a \u201cverdict must be sustained if there is substantial evidence, taking the view most favorable to the Government, to support it.\u201d <em>Glasser v. United States, </em>315 U.S. 60, 80, 62 S.Ct. 457, 86 L.Ed. 680 (1942). In the present case, the testimony at trial showed that Somers supplied numerous people with significant amounts of crack cocaine over a period of almost six years.</p>\n<p id=\"b303-23\">The majority of the evidence against Somers came from the testimony of co-conspirators. Somers\u2019 sole argument on appeal is that this testimony was incredible because the witnesses were convicted drug users seeking reductions in their sentences. We do not review the credibility of the witnesses, and we assume that the jury resolved all contradictions in the testimony and the evidence in favor of the Government. <em>United States v. Romer, </em>148 F.3d 359, 364 (4th Cir.1998), <em>cert. denied, </em>525 U.S. 1141, 119 S.Ct. 1032, 143 L.Ed.2d 41 (1999). The record here shows that the witnesses disclosed their desires for reductions in their sentences, but the jury nevertheless chose to credit their testimony.</p>\n<p id=\"b303-24\">Because we find that there was substantial evidence to support the jury\u2019s verdict, we affirm Somers\u2019 conviction and sentence. We dispense with oral argument because the facts and legal contentions are ade<page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"280\">*280</page-number>quately presented in the materials before the court, and argument would not aid the decisional process.</p>\n<p id=\"b304-4\">\n<em>AFFIRMED.</em>\n</p>\n</opinion>\n</casebody>\n",
