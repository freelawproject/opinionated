We have jurisdiction under 8 U.S.C. \u00a7 1105a(a)(l) (1996).<footnotemark>3</footnotemark> Because petitioners have alleged a colorable claim of estoppel against the government, but an insufficient factual record exists for evaluating that claim, we transfer this case to a district court in accordance with 28 U.S.C. \u00a7 1631 for further consideration in the form of a habeas action.</p>\n<p id=\"b813-20\">I</p>\n<p id=\"b813-21\">Following her engagement to American citizen Allan Cecil, Simona Mauting and her three sons \u2014 who were natives and citizens of the Philippines \u2014 entered the United States on January 20, 1998, using valid \u201cK-l\u201d and \u201cK-2\u201d nonimmigrant visas pursuant to 8 U.S.C. \u00a7 1101(a)(15)(K) (1996); <em>see also </em>8 U.S.C. \u00a7 1184(d) (1996); 8 C.F.R. \u00a7 214.2(k). Simona and Allan Cecil married on March 4, 1988, in the state of California. Anthony Mauting was 20 years old at the time of the marriage; Remigio Mauting was 17 years old.</p>\n<p id=\"b813-22\">On March 23, 1988, Simona sought adjustment of status for herself and her sons and shortly afterwards appeared for an interview before an officer of the Immigra<page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"790\">*790</page-number>tion and Naturalization Service (\u201cINS\u201d). <em>See </em>8 U.S.C. \u00a7 1255(a), (d); 8 C.F.R. \u00a7 214(k)(6)(ii). The INS denied her application on March 27, 1991, after concluding that Simona\u2019s Guamanian divorce in 1987 from her ex-husband was not valid and that her subsequent marriage to Cecil was thereby invalidated. The INS reasoned that the Guamanian divorce was not cognizable under either the laws of the Republic of Philippines or the state of California because neither Simona nor her ex-husband had traveled to Guam to obtain the divorce.</p>\n<p id=\"b814-4\">The INS also issued an order to show cause charging Simona and the Mautings deportable under 8 U.S.C. \u00a7 1255(a)(1)(A) and (B) as having stayed in the United States for a longer time than permitted and as excludable aliens without valid immigrant entry documents. After deportation hearings, an IJ concluded on April 22, 1993, that the Guamanian divorce decree and Simona\u2019s subsequent marriage to Cecil were both valid. The IJ granted Simona adjustment of status.</p>\n<p id=\"b814-5\">However, the IJ held that the Mautings did not qualify as derivative beneficiaries to their mother\u2019s adjusted status because each was over the age of 21 at the time of the decision and was not a \u201cchild\u201d as defined in 8 U.S.C. \u00a7 1101(b)(1). Relying on 8 U.S.C. \u00a7\u00a7 1153(d) and 1158(c), the IJ noted that the determination of the Mautings\u2019 eligibility for derivative status at the time of adjudication accorded with the \u201cusual practice of the [INA] regarding derivative beneficiaries of immigrant visas or application for adjustment of status.\u201d The IJ declined to entertain the Mautings\u2019 claim that the INS should be estopped from deporting them because of the INS\u2019s affirmative misconduct, holding that he was without power to apply equitable estoppel against the INS.</p>\n<p id=\"b814-6\">In a summary order issued on December 29, 1998, the BIA affirmed the IJ\u2019s determination, also holding that it was \u201cwithout authority to apply the doctrines of estoppel and laches\u201d against the INS. This timely petition for review followed.</p>\n<p id=\"b814-8\">We have jurisdiction over this petition for review under the transitional rules because the decisions of the BIA and IJ were based upon an objective, factual determination of eligibility, rather than as a result of an exercise of discretion. <em>Bemal-Vallejo v. INS, </em>195 F.3d 56, 62 (1st Cir.1999); <em>cf. Rashtabadi v. INS, </em>23 F.3d 1562, 1568 (9th Cir.1994). We examine derivative claims for adjustment of status within the context of the strong Congressional preference for maintaining or fostering the unity of immigrant families. <em>See, e.g., </em>S. Rep. No. 1515 at 435, 81st Cong., 2d Sess. (1950).</p>\n<p id=\"b814-9\">Ill</p>\n<p id=\"b814-10\">The BIA and the IJ correctly concluded that neither had the authority to consider the Mautings\u2019 equitable estoppel claim during the administrative process. <em>Galo-Garcia v. INS, </em>86 F.3d 916, 918 (9th Cir.1996); <em>Matter of Hernandez-Puente, </em>20 I &amp; N Dec. 335, 338 (BIA 1991). We may consider equitable estoppel on a petition for review from a deportation order. <em>INS v. Miranda, </em>459 U.S. 14, 18-19, 103 S.Ct. 281, 74 L.Ed.2d 12 (1982); <em>Socop-Gonzalez v. INS, </em>208 F.3d 838, 842 (9th Cir.2000). District courts also have jurisdiction to consider equitable estoppel claims in a habeas corpus proceeding under 28 U.S.C. \u00a7 2241. <em>Sulit v. Schiltgen, </em>213 F.3d 449, 453 (2000).</p>\n<p id=\"b814-11\">Estoppel may be applied against the INS where it engages in some \u201caffirmative misconduct\u201d beyond mere negligence. <em>Socop-Gonzalez, </em>208 F.3d at 842 <em>&amp; </em>n. 4. Mere delay is insufficient to constitute INS affirmative misconduct. <em>INS v. Miranda, </em>459 U.S. 14, 18-19, 103 S.Ct. 281, 74 L.Ed.2d 12 (1982); <em>Jaa v. INS, </em>779 <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"791\">*791</page-number>F.2d 569, 572 (9th Cir.1986). A party asserting estoppel against the government bears heavy burdens. <em>See, e.g., Mukherjee v. INS, </em>793 F.2d 1006, 1008-09 (9th Cir. 1986). Estoppel against the government applies \u201conly where the government\u2019s wrongful act will cause a serious injustice, and the public\u2019s interest will not suffer undue damage by imposition of the liability.\u201d <em>Mukherjee, </em>793 F.2d at 1006. If an equitable estoppel claim is facially deficient, or cannot be sustained on the undisputed facts, we have denied relief. <em>See, e.g., Sulit, </em>213 F.3d at 454 (no equitable estoppel from failure to inform individual of legal rights); <em>Socop-Gonzalez, </em>208 F.3d at 843 (no evidence of a \u201cdeliberate lie\u201d or \u201cpattern of false promises\u201d); <em>Mukherjee, </em>793 F.2d at 1009 (no equitable estoppel based on misinformation).</p>\n<p id=\"b815-5\">However, in this case, the Mautings have alleged and preserved a color-able claim of equitable estoppel. \u201cTo be colorable in this context, the alleged violation need not be substantial, but the claim \u2018must have some possible validity.\u2019 \u201d <em>Torres-Aguilar v. INS, </em>246 F.3d 1267, 1271 (9th Cir.2001) (internal quotations omitted). The Mautings allege, with record support, that the INS deliberately delayed processing their derivative adjustment of status petition until just prior to Remigio Mauting\u2019s twenty-first birthday in order to preclude the derivative claims; that the INS recklessly and without legal or factual basis asserted that Simona Mauting\u2019s divorce was invalid, despite its knowledge to the contrary; that the INS engaged in a deliberate pattern of deception; and that, as a result, the Mautings were forever prevented from obtaining derivative adjustment of status. These claims have enough \u201cpossible validity\u201d to constitute a colorable cause of action for equitable estoppel.</p>\n<p id=\"b815-9\">However, as we have noted, neither the BIA nor the IJ had jurisdiction to consider the Mautings\u2019 estoppel arguments on the merits, and we find the record insufficient for evaluation of the Mautings\u2019 estoppel claims. Thus, transfer to the district court is appropriate under 28 U.S.C. \u00a7 2347(b)(3),<footnotemark>4</footnotemark> <em>see Reno v. Am.-Arab Anti-Discrimination Comm., </em>525 U.S. 471, 496-97 <em>&amp; </em>n. 3, 119 S.Ct. 936, 142 L.Ed.2d 940 (1999) (Ginsburg, J., concurring), and 28 U.S.C. \u00a7 1631.<footnotemark>5</footnotemark> <em>Cf.

O\u2019Neill, </em>806 F.2d 1262, 1265-66 (5th Cir.1987) (remand to district court when petitioner had stated a claim for equitable estoppel against INS on denial of permanent resident status caused by wilful and reckless delay in processing application).
