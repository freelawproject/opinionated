Cox alleged she was illegally discharged based on her disability under the Americans With Disabilities Act of 1990, 42 U.S.C.A. \u00a7\u00a7 12101-12213 (West 1995 &amp; Supp.2000) (\u201cADA\u201d). For the following reasons, we affirm.</p>\n<p id=\"b209-28\">We review dismissals under Rule 12(b)(6) de novo, taking the facts as stated in the complaint as true. <em>GE Inv. Private Placement Partners II v. Parker, </em>247 F.3d 543, 548 (4th Cir.2001). However, in light of Cox\u2019s statement that she is restricted to lifting no more than twenty pounds, we find there is \u201c \u2018[no] set of facts that could <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"186\">*186</page-number>be proved consistent with [her] allegations\u2019 \u201d that would entitle Cox to relief. <em>See id. </em>(quoting <em>H.J. Inc. v. Northwestern Bell Tel. Co., </em>492 U.S. 229, 249-50, 109 S.Ct. 2893, 106 L.Ed.2d 195 (1989)).</p>\n<p id=\"b210-4\">In order to state a claim cognizable under the ADA, Cox must demonstrate she has a disability. A disability is defined by the ADA as: (A) a physical or mental impairment that substantially limits one or more of an individual\u2019s major life activities; (B) a record of such an impairment; or (C) being regarded as having such an impairment. <em>Williams v. Channel Master Satellite Sys., Inc., </em>101 F.3d 346, 348 (4th Cir. 1996) (per curiam) (citing 42 U.S.C.A. \u00a7 12102(2) (West 1995)). However, in <em>Williams, </em>we noted that a lifting restriction of twenty-five pounds did not constitute a substantial limitation to a major life activity, including work. 101 F.3d at 349. Furthermore, the fact that Cox\u2019s restriction is modestly more severe than the restriction considered in <em>Williams </em>does not compel a different outcome, as courts have found twenty-pound lifting restrictions equally unimpairing. <em>See McKay v. Toyota Motor Mfg., USA, Inc. </em>110 F.3d 369, 371, 373 (6th Cir.1997); <em>Wooten v. Farmland Foods, </em>58 F.3d 382, 384, 386 (8th Cir.1995). Accordingly, we find no error in the district court\u2019s conclusion that Cox failed to demonstrate a disability as defined in subsections (A) or (B) of the statute.</p>\n<p id=\"b210-6\">With respect to subsection (C), although <em>Williams </em>does not preclude Cox from demonstrating a disability under that provision, we note that neither Cox\u2019s complaint nor her proffer to the district court in an effort to amend her complaint to state such a claim was sufficient to do so. In order to state a claim under subsection (C) , a plaintiff must allege her employer \u201centertained a misperception about the individual,\u201d or that the \u201cemployer regarded[her] as having an impairment within the meaning of the [ADA].\u201d <em>Sutton v. United Air Lines, Inc., </em>527 U.S. 471, 489, 119 S.Ct. 2139, 144 L.Ed.2d 450 (1999); <em>Francis v. City of Meriden, </em>129 F.3d 281, 285 (2d Cir.1997). However, the allegations in Cox\u2019s complaint and her proffer are insufficient to \u201cdemonstrate either that the employer regarded the employee as disabled or that[that] perception caused the adverse employment action.\u201d <em>Haulbrook v. Michelin N. Am., Inc., </em>252 F.3d 696, 703 (4th Cir.2001) (noting an employer\u2019s awareness of a limitation, without more, does not state a claim under subsection (Q) (internal quotation omitted). As a result, Cox\u2019s attempt to amend her complaint was futile. <em>See HCMF Corp. v. Allen, </em>238 F.3d 273, 276-77 (4th Cir.) (providing standard of review for denial of a motion to amend), <em>cert. denied, </em>\u2014 U.S. -, 121 S.Ct. 2522, 150 L.Ed.2d 694 (2001) (No. 00-1624). Therefore, we conclude both that the district court did not abuse its discretion in declining to allow Cox to add a specific claim under subsection (C) and that the district court\u2019s dismissal of Cox\u2019s complaint for failure to state a claim under subsection (C) as initially pled was not erroneous.</p>\n<p id=\"b210-11\">Accordingly, we affirm the district court\u2019s dismissal of Cox\u2019s action under the ADA for failure to state a claim upon which relief could be granted. We dispense with oral argument because the facts and legal contentions are adequately presented in the materials before the court and argument would not aid the decisional process.</p>\n<p id=\"b210-12\">\n<em>AFFIRMED.</em>\n</p>\n</opinion>\n</casebody>\n",
