His sentence was enhanced under 8 U.S.C. \u00a7 1326(b) because he had previously been deported after conviction for an aggravated felony. The district court<footnotemark>1</footnotemark> sentenced him to 57 months of imprisonment and 2 years of supervised release. On appeal, counsel has filed a brief and moved to withdraw under <em>Anders v. California, </em>386 U.S. 738, 87 S.Ct. 1396, 18 L.Ed.2d 493 (1967), and Napoles-Garcia has not filed a pro se supplemental brief.</p>\n<p id=\"b549-24\">Counsel first argues that Na-poles-Garcia\u2019s prior deportation following his conviction for an aggravated felony was an element <em>of </em>the instant offense under Apprendi <em>v. New Jersey, </em>530 U.S. 466, 120 S.Ct. 2348, 147 L.Ed.2d 435 (2000), and that the district court\u2019s failure to so advise him rendered his guilty plea invalid. This argument lacks merit. <em>See Almendarez-Torres v. United States, </em>523 U.S. 224, 226-27, 118 S.Ct. 1219, 140 L.Ed.2d 350 (1998); <em>United States v. Raya-Ramirez, </em>244 F.3d 976, 977 (8th Cir.2001). Second, counsel argues that the sentence imposed is too harsh. This does not provide a valid basis for appeal. <em>See </em>18 U.S.C. \u00a7 3742(a).</p>\n<p id=\"b549-25\">Having located no nonfrivolous issues for appeal after reviewing the record independently pursuant to <em>Penson v. Ohio, </em>488 U.S. 75, 109 S.Ct. 346, 102 L.Ed.2d 300 (1988), we affirm the judgment of the dis<page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"526\">*526</page-number>triet court and grant counsel\u2019s motion to withdraw.</p>\n<footnote label=\"1\">\n<p id=\"b549-19\">.
