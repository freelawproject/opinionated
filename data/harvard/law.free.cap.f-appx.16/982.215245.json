R.App. P. 34(a)(2); 10th Cir. R. 34.1(G). The case is therefore ordered submitted without oral argument.</p>\n<p id=\"b1007-19\">These consolidated appeals are before the court on Benny McCartney\u2019s request for a certificate of appealability. McCartney seeks a COA so that he can appeal the district court\u2019s denial of his \u00a7 2254 habeas corpus petition. <em>See </em>28 U.S.C. \u00a7 2253(c)(1)(A) (providing that no appeal may be taken from the denial of a \u00a7 2254 habeas petition unless the petitioner first obtains a COA). Because McCartney has not \u201cmade a substantial showing of the denial of a constitutional right,\u201d this court denies his request for a COA and dismisses the appeals. <em>See id. </em>\u00a7 2253(c)(2).</p>\n<p id=\"b1007-20\">Following a jury trial, McCartney was convicted in Oklahoma state court on one count of possession of marijuana and one count of possession of a controlled, dangerous substance. He was sentenced to five years\u2019 imprisonment and a fine of $3000 on each count. On direct appeal to the Oklahoma Court of Criminal Appeals <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"984\">*984</page-number>(\u201cOCCA\u201d), McCartney asserted the following three claims: (1) the trial court denied him his Fourteenth Amendment right to due process by imposing a f\u00edne in addition to a sentence of imprisonment; (2) the arresting officers violated the Fourth Amendment when they used a drug dog to sniff the exterior of McCartney\u2019s car; and (3) his counsel was constitutionally ineffective in failing to move to suppress the drugs seized from the vehicle. Despite the fact that McCartney had not raised the Fourth Amendment claim before the trial court, the OCCA considered and rejected all three claims on the merits in a summary opinion. In particular, the OCCA held that the trial court was specifically empowered by state law to impose a fine in addition to the terms of imprisonment, a dog sniff of the exterior of a car did not constitute a search, and counsel was not ineffective in failing to bring a motion to suppress because such a motion would have failed as a matter of law.</p>\n<p id=\"b1008-4\">After exhausting his state court remedies, McCartney filed the instant \u00a7 2254 habeas corpus petition raising the same three issues that he had raised on direct appeal to the OCCA. The district court referred McCartney\u2019s petition to a magistrate judge for initial proceedings pursuant to 28 U.S.C. \u00a7 636(b)(1). The magistrate judge began by noting that McCartney would be entitled to habeas relief only if he could establish that the opinion of the OCCA rejecting his claims was \u201ccontrary to, or involved an unreasonable application of, clearly established Federal law, as determined by the Supreme Court of the United States.\u201d 28 U.S.C. \u00a7 2254(d)(1). Applying those standards, as elucidated in the Supreme Court\u2019s recent decision in <em>Williams v. Taylor, </em>529 U.S. 362, 402-13, 120 S.Ct. 1495, 146 L.Ed.2d 389 (2000), the magistrate judge concluded that McCartney\u2019s first and third claims failed on the merits and that habeas review of his Fourth Amendment claim was barred by <em>Stone v. Powell, </em>428 U.S. 465, 96 S.Ct. 3037, 49 L.Ed.2d 1067 (1976). Upon <em>de novo </em>review of the magistrate judge\u2019s report and recommendation and McCartney\u2019s objections thereto, the district court adopted the report and recommendation and denied McCartney\u2019s \u00a7 2254 habeas petition.</p>\n<p id=\"b1008-6\">As noted above, McCartney must obtain a COA before he can appeal the district court\u2019s denial of his \u00a7 2254 habeas petition. <em>See </em>28 U.S.C. \u00a7 2253(c)(1)(A). McCartney is entitled to a COA only upon making a \u201csubstantial showing of the denial of a constitutional right.\u201d <em>Id. </em>\u00a7 2253(c)(2). He can make this showing by demonstrating that the issues raised are debatable among jurists, a court could resolve the issues differently, or that the questions presented deserve further proceedings. <em>See Slack v. McDaniel, </em>529 U.S. 473, 483, 120 S.Ct. 1595, 146 L.Ed.2d 542 (2000). This court has reviewed McCartney\u2019s request for a COA and accompanying brief, along with the magistrate judge\u2019s report and recommendation, the district court\u2019s order, and the entire record on appeal. That close review reveals that the district court\u2019s resolution of McCartney\u2019s petition is not debatable, subject to an alternate resolution, or deserving of further proceedings. Accordingly, this court GRANTS McCartney\u2019s request to proceed on appeal <em>in forma pauperis </em>and DENIES his request for a COA for substantially those reasons set forth in the magistrate judge\u2019s report and recommendation dated February 8, 2001, and the district court\u2019s order dated April 2, 2001. McCartney\u2019s appeal is, therefore, DISMISSED. <em>See </em>28 U.S.C. \u00a7 2253(c).</p>\n<footnote label=\"*\">\n<p id=\"b1007-14\"> This order and judgment is not binding precedent, except under the doctrines of law of the case, res judicata and collateral estoppel. The court generally disfavors the citation of orders and judgments; nevertheless, an order and judgment may be cited under the terms and conditions of 10th Cir. R. 36.3.</p>\n</footnote>\n</opinion>\n</casebody>\n",
