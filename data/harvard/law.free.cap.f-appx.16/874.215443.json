R.App. P. 34(a)(2); 10th Cir. R. 34.1(G). The case is therefore ordered submitted without oral argument.</p>\n<p id=\"b899-5\">Petitioner George Thomas Pratt, a federal prisoner appearing pro se, appeals the district court\u2019s dismissal of his 28 U.S.C. \u00a7 2241 petition challenging his conviction and sentence. We have jurisdiction under 28 U.S.C. \u00a7 1291 and affirm.</p>\n<p id=\"b899-6\">Pratt entered a plea of guilty to conspiracy to manufacture methamphetamine and was sentenced to 210 months of imprisonment. His direct appeal was affirmed. <em>United States v. Pratt, </em>No. 91-7041, 1992 WL 83489 (10th Cir. Apr.23, 1992). His two 28 U.S.C. \u00a7 2255 motions were denied and he did not appeal from those denials.</p>\n<p id=\"b899-7\">In his \u00a7 2241 petition, Pratt argued his sentence was based on findings set forth in the presentence investigation report rather than in the indictment, and that \u201c[a]ll sentencing determination^] [were] by preponderance of the evidence.\u201d Amended Petition at 6. The Government filed a motion to dismiss for lack of jurisdiction, arguing Pratt\u2019s claim was a challenge to the validity of his sentence that should be filed as a \u00a7 2255 in the district where he was convicted. In its report and recommendation, the magistrate court recommended that the motion to dismiss be granted, determining Pratt\u2019s claims attacked the validity of his judgment and sentence rather than execution of his sentence and must be brought under \u00a7 2255. The district court adopted the report and recommendation and granted the motion to dismiss.</p>\n<p id=\"b899-8\">\u201cA petition under 28 U.S.C. \u00a7 2241 attacks the execution of a sentence rather than its validity and must be filed in the district where the prisoner is confined.\u201d <em>Bradshaw v. Story, </em>86 F.3d 164, 166 (10th Cir.1996). A petition under 28 U.S.C. \u00a7 2255 attacks the legality of detention and must be filed in the district that imposed the sentence. <em>Id. </em>A petition under \u00a7 2241 \u201cis not an additional, alternative, or supplemental remedy to 28 U.S.C. \u00a7 2255.\u201d <em>Id.</em></p>\n<p id=\"b899-12\">Pratt contended the \u00a7 2255 remedy was inadequate and ineffective because he could not have presented his claim based on <em>Apprendi v. New Jersey, </em>530 U.S. 466, 120 S.Ct. 2348, 147 L.Ed.2d 435 (2000) in his earlier \u00a7 2255 motions and he is now precluded from filing a successive \u00a7 2255 motion. \u201cFailure to obtain relief under 2255 does not establish that the remedy so provided is either inadequate or ineffective.\u201d <em>Bradshaw, </em>86 F.3d at 166. The magistrate found that Pratt had not alleged he had been denied certification of a successive \u00a7 2255 motion. Further, even if Pratt\u2019s <em>Apprendi </em>claim were properly brought under \u00a7 2255, he could not satisfy the AEDPA criteria. A new rule of constitutional law is \u201cmade retroactive to cases on collateral review\u201d only when the Supreme Court holds it to be retroactively applicable. <em>Tyler v. Cain, </em>533 U.S. 656, 121 S.Ct. 2478, 2482, 150 L.Ed.2d 632 (2001). Although the decision in <em>Apprendi </em>enunciated a new rule of constitutional law, the Supreme Court has not specifically held the rule to be retroactive to cases \"on collateral review. <em>See Browning v. United States, </em>241 F.3d 1262, 1266 (10th Cir.2001) (en banc). Consequently, an <em>Apprendi </em>challenge may not be raised at this time in a successive \u00a7 2255 motion. <em>Id. </em>at 1266-67.</p>\n<p id=\"b899-15\">We have reviewed Pratt\u2019s appellate brief and the entire record and agree with the thorough and well-reasoned analysis set forth in the magistrate\u2019s report and recom<page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"876\">*876</page-number>mendation, which was adopted by the district court.</p>\n<p id=\"b900-4\">AFFIRMED. The mandate shall issue forthwith.</p>\n<footnote label=\"*\">\n<p id=\"b898-17\"> This order and judgment is not binding precedent, except under the doctrines of law of the case, res judicata, and collateral estoppel. <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"875\">*875</page-number>The court generally disfavors the citation of orders and judgments; nevertheless, an order and judgment may be cited under the terms and conditions of 10th Cir. R. 36.3.</p>\n</footnote>\n</opinion>\n</casebody>\n",
