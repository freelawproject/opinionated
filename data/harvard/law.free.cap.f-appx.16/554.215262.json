Although he did not file a direct appeal, Roney now seeks post-conviction relief under 28 U.S.C. \u00a7 2255, claiming he received ineffective assistance of counsel (among other claims) because counsel failed to file an appeal as instructed. The district court initially denied Roney\u2019s petition without a hearing. Roney appealed and we remanded for additional proceedings because under <em>Holloway v. United States, </em>960 F.2d 1348, 1356-57 (8th Cir. 1992), a client receives ineffective assistance of counsel when counsel fails to file a requested appeal, regardless of whether the client can prove actual prejudice. <em>See Roney v. United States, </em>No. 97-3047 (8th Cir. Oct. 31, 1997). After an evidentiary hearing, the district court denied Roney\u2019s petition. Roney appealed a second time, arguing he was entitled to appointment of counsel at the evidentiary hearing. We agreed and remanded for further proceedings. <em>See Roney v. United States, </em>205 F.3d 1061, 1062 (8th Cir.2000).</p>\n<p id=\"b579-10\">After holding an evidentiary hearing at which Roney was represented by counsel, a magistrate judge <footnotemark>*</footnotemark> recommended denying Roney\u2019s petition; the district court <footnotemark>**</footnotemark> agreed, adopting the recommendation. The court credited counsels\u2019 testimony that Roney did not request an appeal and found Roney fabricated a letter he offered as proof of his instruction to counsel to appeal. Roney then filed this appeal, claiming the district court mistakenly believed counsels\u2019 testimony instead of his own. Having reviewed the factual findings for clear error and giving deference to the district court\u2019s credibility determinations, we reject Roney\u2019s assertion that despite credible evidence to the contrary, his claim that he made a request is sufficient to merit relief. <em>See Barger v. United States, </em>204 F.3d 1180, 1181-82 (8th Cir.2000). Although Roney argues he was credible and his lead attorney was not, the district court\u2019s contrary conclusion is well-supported by the testimony of Roney\u2019s two attorneys and the inconsistencies in Roney\u2019s version of events. In addition, the inconsistencies in Roney\u2019s letter support the district court\u2019s suspicion of its authenticity.</p>\n<p id=\"b579-14\">We thus conclude the district court\u2019s findings are not clearly erroneous and we affirm. \u2019 <em>See </em>8th Cir. R. 47B.</p>\n<p id=\"b579-15\">A true copy.</p>\n<footnote label=\"*\">\n<p id=\"b579-11\"> The Honorable James C.
