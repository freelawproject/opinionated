We affirm.</p>\n<p id=\"b690-10\">(1) Mirka\u2019s action under Title II of the ADA fails at the outset because her unique volunteer position at City Hall was not a service, program or activity of the City. <em>See </em>42 U.S.C. \u00a7 12132. The services she performed were what we have denominated \u201cinput\u201d rather than \u201coutput\u201d functions. <em>See Zimmerman v. Oregon Dep\u2019t. of Justice, </em>170 F.3d 1169, 1174 (9th Cir. 1999). Mirka\u2019s attempt to shift the focus to the \u201csubjected to discrimination\u201d portion of \u00a7 12132 also fails because that, too, keys on the services, program or activity requirement. <em>Id. </em>at 1175. Nor can Mirka avoid this by broadening the focus to every possible volunteer function performed within or for the City, or its various departments, and then declaring that volunteer services, in general, are an activity or program.</p>\n<p id=\"b690-13\">(2) Mirka\u2019s claim under the Rehabilitation Act fails for the same basic reason. That is not surprising because in this area the two Acts are essentially congruent. <em>See Bay Area Addiction Research &amp; Treatment, Inc. v. City of Antioch, </em>179 F.3d 725, 730 n. 8 (9th Cir.1999); <em>Zukle v. Regents of the Univ. of Cal, </em>166 F.3d 1041, 1045 n. 11 (9th Cir.1999). In addition, however, Mirka has failed to show that her volunteer position was supported by federal funds. <em>See United States Dep\u2019t of Transp. v. Paralyzed Veterans of Am., </em>477 U.S. 597, 604-07, 106 S.Ct. 2705, 2710-12, 91 L.Ed.2d 494 (1986).</p>\n<p id=\"b690-14\">AFFIRMED.</p>\n<footnote label=\"**\">\n<p id=\"b690-11\"> This disposition is not appropriate for publication and may not be cited to or by the courts of this circuit except as provided by Ninth Circuit Rule 36-3.</p>\n</footnote>\n</opinion>\n</casebody>\n",
