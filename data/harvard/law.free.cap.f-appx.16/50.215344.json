Jones-Blair\u2019s brief on appeal provides no basis for reversal.</p>\n<p id=\"b75-12\">The district court dismissed the complaint against the Medical Center pursuant to Fed.R.Civ.P. 12(b)(6) on the grounds of (1) failure to state a claim on which relief can be granted, and (2) failure to file an administrative claim within 180 days of the alleged discriminatory act. Although it appears that a 300-day, rather than a 180-day, period was applicable, we affirm the dismissal with respect to the Medical Center on the ground that the complaint failed to state a claim on which relief can be granted against that defendant, substantially for the reasons stated in Judge Mishler\u2019s Memorandum of Decision and Order dated March 4, 1999, at pages 1-5 and 10-20.</p>\n<p id=\"b75-16\">The district court dismissed the complaint against the Association on the ground that Jones-Blair failed to adduce evidence of circumstances permitting an inference of racial discrimination. We affirm that decision substantially for the reasons stated in Judge Mishler\u2019s Memorandum of Decision and Order dated June 28, 2000.</p>\n<p id=\"b75-17\">We have considered all of Jones-Blair\u2019s contentions on this appeal and have found in them no basis for reversal. The judgment of the district court is affirmed.</p>\n</opinion>\n</casebody>\n",
