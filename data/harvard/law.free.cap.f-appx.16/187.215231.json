He appeals, claiming that the district court erred in denying his motion for new trial based on newly discovered evidence. He also claims that the Government\u2019s failure to produce that evidence before trial denied him due process.</p>\n<p id=\"b211-24\">Because we find that the evidence \u2014 certain employment records of Pate and the victim, and handwritten investigators\u2019 notes-would not have resulted in Pate\u2019s acquittal, the district court did not abuse its discretion in denying Pate\u2019s motion for new trial under Fed.R.Crim.P. 33. <em>United States v. Singh, </em>54 F.3d 1182, 1190 (4th Cir.1995); <em>United States v. Christy, </em>3 F.3d 765, 768 (4th Cir.1993). Further, we find that Pate failed to establish a violation of <em>Brady v. Maryland, </em>373 U.S. 83, 83 S.Ct. 1194, 10 L.Ed.2d 215 (1963). Pate cannot show that he was prejudiced by the Government\u2019s failure to disclose investigators\u2019 notes containing the <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"188\">*188</page-number>physical description of the robber because the description of the robber was generally consistent with Pate\u2019s physical characteristics.</p>\n<p id=\"b212-4\">Accordingly, we affirm the district court\u2019s denial of Pate\u2019s motion for new trial and affirm Pate\u2019s conviction and sentence. We dispense with oral argument because the facts and legal contentions are adequately presented in the materials before the court and argument would not aid in the decisional process.</p>\n<p id=\"b212-5\">\n<em>AFFIRMED.</em>\n</p>\n</opinion>\n</casebody>\n",
