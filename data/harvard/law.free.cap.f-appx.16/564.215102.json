On appeal, Brimmage\u2019s counsel has filed a brief and moved to withdraw under <em>Anders v. California, </em>386 U.S. 738, 87 S.Ct. 1396, 18 L.Ed.2d 493 (1967), and Brimmage has filed a pro se supplemental brief requesting substitute counsel.</p>\n<p id=\"b589-19\">We reject each of the issues raised on appeal. Brimmage\u2019s failure to attempt to withdraw his guilty plea below precludes him from challenging its voluntariness in this appeal, <em>see United States v. Bond, </em>135 F.3d 1247, 1249 (8th Cir.) (per curiam) (this court need not address plea-withdrawal claim which defendant did not present to district court), <em>cert. denied, </em>524 U.S. 961, 118 S.Ct. 2388, 141 L.Ed.2d 753 (1998); <em>United States v. Murphy, </em>899 F.2d 714, 716 (8th Cir.1990) (claim of involuntary guilty plea \u201cfirst must be presented to the district court and [is] not cognizable on direct appeal\u201d); his intertwined ineffective-assistance claim should be presented in postconviction proceedings, <em>see United States v. Cain, </em>134 F.3d 1345, 1352 (8th Cir.1998) (claim that ineffective assistance of counsel invalidated defendant\u2019s guilty plea should be raised in 28 U.S.C. \u00a7 2255 motion, not direct appeal); and the issue of the voluntariness of Brimmage\u2019s statement to police was foreclosed by his unconditional guilty plea, <em>see United States v. Stewart, </em>972 F.2d 216, 217-18 (8th Cir.1992) (defendant who unconditionally pleads guilty waives all nonjurisdictional defenses).</p>\n<p id=\"b589-20\">We have reviewed the record independently under <em>Penson v. Ohio, </em>488 U.S. 75, 109 S.Ct. 346, 102 L.Ed.2d 300 (1988), and we have found no nonfrivolous issues for appeal. Accordingly, we affirm the judgment of the district court, grant Brimmage\u2019s counsel\u2019s motion to withdraw, and deny Brimmage\u2019s request for new counsel.</p>\n<footnote label=\"1\">\n<p id=\"b589-17\">.
