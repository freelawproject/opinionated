Plaintiff, then represented by counsel, failed to adduce any evidence, <em>inter alia, </em>that the position he sought was one that the appointing authority filled or wished to fill. We also see no error in the district court\u2019s denial of leave to amend; the proposed amended complaint submitted to the court also lacked any allegation that the position plaintiff sought was one that the appointing authority filled or wished to fill.</p>\n<p id=\"b74-18\">We have considered all of plaintiffs contentions on this appeal and have found them to be without merit. The judgment of the district court is affirmed.</p>\n</opinion>\n</casebody>\n",
