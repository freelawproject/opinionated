The district court increased the base offense level by two levels under U.S.S.G. \u00a7 3Bl.l(c) due to the defendant\u2019s role in the conspiracy. For reasons stated hereafter, we AFFIRM.</p>\n<p id=\"b435-27\">\n<em>I. BACKGROUND</em>\n</p>\n<p id=\"b435-28\">Daniel Martinez (\u201cMartinez\u201d) was indicted on April 10, 1996, and charged with conspiracy to possess with intent to dis<page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"412\">*412</page-number>tribute marijuana. Martinez had delivered marijuana to Michigan from Arizona between 1993 and 1995. On October 23, 1996, the government sent a letter to Martinez\u2019s attorney, detailing an offer for a plea agreement. Specifically at issue in this appeal is a statement within the letter wherein the government agreed to \u201ctake no position on [Martinez\u2019s] role in the offense.\u201d Joint Appendix, Vol. 1 at 113. On November 7, 1996, Martinez pleaded guilty to the charge pursuant to a Rule 11 plea agreement and admitted that he was a member of the conspiracy. Notably, however, the written Rule 11 plea agreement made no mention of the government\u2019s position on Martinez\u2019s role in the offense.</p>\n<p id=\"b436-4\">In the presentence report, the probation officer recommended that Martinez\u2019s base offense level be increased by two levels pursuant to United States Sentencing Commission Guideline (\u201cU.S.S.G.\u201d) \u00a7 3B1.1 (c) because he had recruited others as couriers to transport money and drugs for the conspiracy. The resultant guideline sentencing range due to these adjustments was 78-97 months. Martinez filed an objection to the enhancement for the role in the offense. During the sentencing hearing, Martinez again objected to the enhancement for his role in the offense, arguing that he had occupied a relatively low position in the organization. The government, however, disputed Martinez\u2019s characterization of his role in the offense and adamantly argued in support of the enhancement. Importantly, however, the only objection made during the sentencing hearing was as to the factual circumstances surrounding the determination that Martinez was an organizer, leader, manager or supervisor and the guidelines\u2019 applicability' in that regard; <em>no </em>mention was made of the October 23, 1996 letter from the government. After hearing arguments from counsel, the district court concluded that Martinez\u2019s admission that he had recruited a courier was sufficient to support a two-level enhancement under U.S.S.G. \u00a7 SBl.lCc).<footnotemark>1</footnotemark> Accordingly, the applicable guideline range was 78-97 months as recommended by the probation officer. Martinez asserts two errors with his sentencing: (1) that the government breached the plea agreement and (2) that the district court erred in increasing his base offense level for his role in the offense.</p>\n<p id=\"b436-8\">\n<em>II. ANALYSIS</em>\n</p>\n<p id=\"b436-9\">A. Alleged Breach Of The Plea Agreement.</p>\n<p id=\"b436-10\">First, Martinez contends that the government violated his Rule 11 plea agreement by arguing in support of an enhancement for his role in the offense. Martinez contends that part of the inducement for him to enter a guilty plea under the Rule 11 agreement was the October 23, 1996 letter in which the government stated that it would take no position regarding his role in the offense. Whether government conduct has violated a plea agreement is a question of law reviewed de novo. <em>See United States v. Wells, </em>211 F.3d 988, 995 (6th Cir.2000).</p>\n<p id=\"b436-11\">At sentencing, the probation officer recommended a two point increase for Martinez\u2019s role in the offense and during the sentencing hearing, the government argued in favor of the two point increase. <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"413\">*413</page-number>Martinez claims that the government breached a promise that was outside the written plea agreement, specifically by taking a position relative to Martinez\u2019s role in the offense. The government, however, contends that Martinez\u2019s argument is precluded by an integration clause in the plea agreement and by Martinez\u2019s assurances in open court during his guilty plea that no other promises were made to him. The government farther contends that Martinez\u2019s failure to object at the sentencing hearing when the government argued in support of a role in the offense adjustment effected a waiver of this claim.</p>\n<p id=\"b437-5\">In <em>Santobello v. New York, </em>404 U.S. 257, 92 S.Ct. 495, 80 L.Ed.2d 427 (1971), the Supreme Court stated, \u201cwhen a plea rests in any significant degree on a promise or agreement of the prosecutor, so that it can be said to be part of the inducement or consideration, such promise must be fulfilled.\u201d <em>Id. </em>at 262, 92 S.Ct. at 499. The language of <em>Santobello </em>has established the principle that a plea bargain is contractual in nature. <em>See United States v. Herrera, </em>928 F.2d 769, 771 (6th Cir.1991) (citing <em>United States v. Arnett, </em>628 F.2d 1162, 1164 (9th Cir.1979)).</p>\n<p id=\"b437-6\">Martinez\u2019s written plea agreement states that \u201c[t]his agreement incorporates the complete understanding between the parties, and no other promises have been made by the government to the defendant or to the attorney for the defendant.\u201d Joint Appendix, Vol. 1 at 48. During the sentencing hearing. Martinez\u2019s counsel argued that the enhancement should not apply for <em>factual </em>reasons only. At this crucial moment, neither Martinez nor his attorney informed the court of any additional terms in the plea agreement which they now allege.</p>\n<p id=\"b437-10\">Plea agreements are to be strictly construed. <em>See United States v. Brummett, </em>786 F.2d 720, 723 (6th Cir.1986). Although the government did <em>offer </em>to take no position on Martinez\u2019s role in the offense. Martinez\u2019s assertion that he and the government <em>agreed </em>that the government would take no position on his role in the offense is contradicted by the express terms of the plea agreement. <em>See Baker v. United States, </em>781 F.2d 85, 90 (6th Cir. 1986). In <em>Baker, </em>we stated that \u201c[i]t is impossible for a trial judge to properly administer a plea agreement if it consists of secret terms known only to the parties.\u201d <footnotemark>2</footnotemark> <em>Id. </em>Furthermore, it should be noted that once it became clear at the sentencing hearing that the government was going to take an active position regarding Martinez\u2019s role in the offense, it would have been reasonable for Martinez, who was present and represented by counsel, to object if the agreement did indeed prevent the government from taking a position regarding his role in the offense or if he <em>believed </em>that the agreement precluded such argument. It is significant that in this case the alleged promise was broken, if at all, in open court and in the presence of the defendant <em>and </em>his attorney. Martinez\u2019s failure to object to the government\u2019s statement at sentencing constitutes a waiver of any objection. <em>See United States v. Cullens, </em>67 F.3d 123, 124 (6th Cir.1995).</p>\n<p id=\"b437-11\">In the instant case, the probation department put forward information suggesting that Martinez acted as a leader in this offense and recommended a two-level adjustment to reflect this role. Martinez only suggested during sentencing that this finding was not factually accurate and was not supported by the guidelines- \u2014 he did <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"414\">*414</page-number>not reference any breach of a plea agreement by the government. When the district court inquired as to the government\u2019s position on the enhancement, the government advocated the position adopted by the presentence investigation report. Martinez\u2019s protestations concerning the purported violation of the plea agreement are foreclosed by his failure to preserve the issue and because the plea agreement allowed the government to act as it did. Furthermore, the plea agreement makes clear that the trial judge is the one who determines and resolves all sentencing issues and, consistent with this proposition, the government reserved the right to defend any and all sentencing determinations made by the judge. <em>See </em>Joint Appendix, Vol. 1 at 45 (Plea Agreement). Finally, where the parties have inserted an integration clause into the plea agreement, that \u201cintegration clause normally prevents a criminal defendant, who has entered into a plea agreement, from asserting that the government made oral promises to him not contained in the plea agreement itself.\u201d <em>United States v. Hunt, </em>205 F.3d 931, 935 (6th Cir.2000). Accordingly, we find there was no breach of the plea agreement.</p>\n<p id=\"b438-4\">B. Applicability Of The Enhancement.</p>\n<p id=\"b438-5\">Second, Martinez contends that the district court erred in enhancing his base level offense by two points for being a leader or organizer of the conspiracy pursuant to U.S.S.G. \u00a7 8B1.1(c). While admitting that he recruited a courier to transport the drugs, Martinez argued at sentencing that the enhancement should not apply to a person who occupies the \u201cbottom of [the distribution] ladder\u201d and, furthermore, that recruiting only one person should not be sufficient for the enhancement to apply. Joint Appendix, Vol. 1 at 90. In reviewing federal sentencing guidelines, the factual findings of the district court are reviewed for clear error, while the district court\u2019s application and interpretation of the guidelines are reviewed de novo. <em>See United States v. Clements, </em>144 F.3d 981, 982 (6th Cir.1998); <em>United States v. Barton, </em>100 F.3d 43, 44 (6th Cir.1996). Specifically, a district court\u2019s finding as to the applicability of section 3B1.1 is a factual finding subject to the clearly erroneous standard of review. <em>See United States v. Feinman, </em>930 F.2d 495, 500 (6th Cir.1991).</p>\n<p id=\"b438-7\">Section 3Bl.l(c) of the Sentencing Guidelines states:</p>\n<blockquote id=\"b438-8\">Based on the defendant\u2019s role in the offense, increase the offense level as follows:</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b438-9\">(c) If the defendant was an organizer, leader, manager, or supervisor in any criminal activity other than described in (a) or (b), increase by 2 levels.</blockquote>\n<p id=\"b438-10\">When evaluating the role of a defendant for the purpose of section 3B1.1, relevant factors to consider include: (1) the exercise of the decision-making authority; (2) the nature of the participation in the commission of the offense; (3) the recruitment of accomplices; (4) the claimed right to a larger share of the fruits of the crime; (5) the degrees of participation in planning or organizing the offense; (6) the nature and scope of the illegal activity; and (7) the degree of control and authority exercised over others. <em>See </em>U.S.S.G. \u00a7 3B1.1, comment. (n. 4). \u201cTo qualify for an adjustment under this section, the defendant must have been the organizer, leader, manager, or supervisor of <em>one or more </em>other participants .\u201d U.S.S.G. \u00a7 3B1.1, comment, (n. 2) (emphasis added). The government bears the burden of establishing, by a preponderance of the evidence, the factors supporting an enhancement due to a defendant\u2019s aggravating role in the offense. <em>See United States v. Ables, </em>167 F.3d 1021, 1035 (6th Cir.), cert. <em>denied, </em><page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"415\">*415</page-number>527 U.S. 1027, 119 S.Ct. 2378, 144 L.Ed.2d 781 (1999).</p>\n<p id=\"b439-5\">Through his counsel, Martinez conceded at sentencing that he was \u201cinvolved in the recruitment of one Jaime Webber; and that\u2019s correctly noted in the presentence report.\u201d Joint Appendix, Vol. 1 at 88. \u201cWhere the defendant exerts control over at least one participant in a supervisory, managerial, leadership, or organizational capacity, a sentence enhancement is required under \u00a7 3B1.1.\u201d <em>United States v. Gort-DiDonato, </em>109 F.3d 318, 321 (6th Cir.1997). <em>See also </em>U.S.S.G. \u00a7 3B1.1, comment, (n. 2). The fact that the conspiracy in this case involved only four persons, two of whom were above Martinez, does not disqualify Martinez as a leader, organizer, supervisor, or manager of the conspiracy.<footnotemark>3</footnotemark> Additionally, the district court noted that the government had \u201ccredibly proffer[ed] additional evidence which indicates that the defendant had other kinds of organizational responsibilities....\u201d Joint Appendix, Vol. 1 at 97. Given the uncontroverted, and even conceded, facts that the district court had before it, and the arguments that were made to the district court, the enhancement for Martinez\u2019s role in the offense under section 3B1 .1(c) was not clearly erroneous.</p>\n<p id=\"b439-6\">AFFIRMED.</p>\n<footnote label=\"1\">\n<p id=\"b436-5\">. With regard to the enhancement, the district court found as follows:</p>\n<blockquote id=\"b436-6\">In any event. I find that the evidence, even if I were to focus purely on the conceded evidence, that is the defendant here recruited, that is to say organized, the participation of Jaime Webber, that within the context of an ongoing criminal enterprise like this is sufficient to justify a 3 B 1.1(c) aggravating level \u2014 aggravating role circumstances such that the offense level increases by two levels.</blockquote>\n<p id=\"b436-13\">Joint Appendix, Vol. 1 at 97-98.</p>\n</footnote>\n<footnote label=\"2\">\n<p id=\"b437-7\">. Martinez\u2019s reliance upon cases cited within his brief is misplaced. In each of the cases he cites, there is a specific reference in the <em>plea agreement </em>to the fact in contention or an acknowledgment by the government that the facts were in some way being limited.</p>\n</footnote>\n<footnote label=\"3\">\n<p id=\"b439-8\">. The fact that another also took a leadership role does not preclude a leadership adjustment in Martinez's offense level. See U.S.S.G. \u00a7 3B1.1, comment, (n. 4) (\u201cThere can, of course, be more than one person who qualifies as a leader or organizer of a criminal association or conspiracy\u201d).</p>\n</footnote>\n</opinion>\n</casebody>\n",
