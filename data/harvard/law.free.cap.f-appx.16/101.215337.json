Jackson\u2019s counsel filed a brief pursuant to <em>Anders v. California, </em>386 U.S. 738, 744, 87 S.Ct. 1396, 18 L.Ed.2d 493 (1967), in which he represents that there are no arguable issues of merit in this appeal. Nonetheless, in his brief, counsel addressed the possibility that the district court should have allowed Jackson to withdraw his guilty plea, and improperly denied Jackson a downward departure at sentencing based on substantial assistance. <em>See U.S. Sentencing Guidelines </em>\u00a7 5K1 .1 (2000). Jackson has not filed a supplemental pro se brief. Finding no merit to either of these claims of error, and discovering no other reversible error in our review of the record, we affirm Jackson\u2019s conviction and sentence.</p>\n<p id=\"b127-4\"><page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"103\">*103</page-number>In order to withdraw his guilty plea on direct appeal under Fed.R.Crim.P. 32(e), Jackson must demonstrate \u201ca fair and just reason\u201d for withdrawing his guilty plea, <em>United States v. Ubakanma, </em>215 F.3d 421, 424 (4th Cir.2000), by making a sufficient showing under the six factors identified in <em>United States v. Moore, </em>931 F.2d 245, 248 (4th Cir.1991).<footnotemark>*</footnotemark> However, if the proceeding under Fed.R.Crim.P. 11, which is the predicate for such a plea, is found to be adequate after close scrutiny, a strong presumption arises that the plea is final and binding. <em>United States v. Puckett, </em>61 F.3d 1092, 1099 (4th Cir.1995). We have examined Jackson\u2019s brief and the joint appendix, and find ho reason to allow Jackson to withdraw his guilty plea.</p>\n<p id=\"b127-5\">As a preliminary matter, our review of the Rule 11 hearing indicates that it was properly conducted. At the Rule 11 hearing the court informed Jackson of the mandatory minimum penalty, and that it could not determine the guideline sentence until completion of his presentence report. During the colloquy, Jackson acknowledged that his sentence could be more or less severe than he expected. Furthermore, Jackson was apprised of the elements of the crime with which he was charged, and the Government\u2019s burden in proving those elements. As a result, we find Jackson cannot challenge the sufficiency of his Rule 11 hearing, and thus the strong presumption that his plea was final and binding. <em>See Puckett, </em>61 F.3d at 1099.</p>\n<p id=\"b127-6\">Nor is Jackson\u2019s attempt to overcome that presumption by recourse to the <em>Moore </em>factors persuasive. Jackson reaffirmed his responsibility for his offense at his Rule 11 hearing and again at sentencing. Similarly, his statements at the Rule 11 hearing indicated he agreed to the plea freely and voluntarily, and was not coerced or improperly induced into doing so. Hence, Jackson fails to demonstrate that his plea was not knowing or voluntary under <em>Moore. </em>931 F.2d at 248. Likewise, Jackson\u2019s repeated assertions of guilt and responsibility for his crimes, combined with the Government\u2019s factual showing at sentencing, indicate Jackson cannot satisfy the second requirement under <em>Moore, </em>that he credibly assert his legal innocence. <em>Id. </em>Accordingly, because our review indicates none of the other <em>Moore </em>factors favor Jackson either, we find his request to withdraw his guilty plea on direct appeal meritless.</p>\n<p id=\"b127-12\">With respect to Jackson\u2019s second assignment of error, Jackson cannot sustain his claim that he was improperly denied a downward departure for the substantial assistance he claims he rendered to authorities investigating his offense. Under the Sentencing Guidelines, a defendant has no right to a downward departure for substantial assistance under \u00a7 5K1.1, <em>United States v. LeRose, </em>219 F.3d 335, 343 (4th Cir.2000), and Jackson has not asserted that the Government\u2019s refusal to seek one at sentencing resulted from improper or suspect motives, <em>Wade v. United States, </em>504 U.S. 181, 186, 112 S.Ct. 1840, 118 L.Ed.2d 524 (1992). Accordingly, we find this assignment of error to be without merit as well.</p>\n<p id=\"b127-13\">In accordance with <em>Anders, </em>we have reviewed the entire record and find no reversible error. We therefore affirm. This court requires that counsel inform his client, in writing, of his right to petition the Supreme Court of the United States for further review. If the client requests that a petition be filed, but counsel be<page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"104\">*104</page-number>lieves that such a petition would be frivolous, then counsel may move in this court for leave to withdraw from representation. Counsel\u2019s motion must state that a copy thereof was served on the client.</p>\n<p id=\"b128-4\">We dispense with oral argument because the facts and legal contentions are adequately presented in the materials before the court and argument would not aid the decisional process.</p>\n<p id=\"b128-5\">\n<em>AFFIRMED.</em>\n</p>\n<footnote label=\"*\">\n<p id=\"b127-7\"> We assume, without deciding, that Jackson's initial challenge to the validity of his guilty plea on appeal imposes no greater burden on him than if he had originally raised this challenge before the district court, as it is clear that Jackson cannot prevail even under the standards applicable to review of a district court's denial of a Rule 32(e) motion.</p>\n</footnote>\n</opinion>\n</casebody>\n",
