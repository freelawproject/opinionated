Because Burton\u2019s petition was filed after the effective date of the Anti-Terrorism and Effective Death Penalty Act (\u201cAEDPA\u201d), the provisions of that Act apply to his case. <em>See Patterson v. Stewart, </em>251 F.3d 1243, 1245 (9th Cir. <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"793\">*793</page-number>2001). AEDPA imposes a one-year statute of limitations on habeas corpus petitions filed by state prisoners in federal court. <em>See </em>28 U.S.C. \u00a7 2244(d)(1). State prisoners, like Burton, whose convictions became final prior to AEDPA\u2019s enactment, have a one-year grace period in which to file their petitions in federal court. <em>See Patterson </em>at 1245. We review the district court\u2019s dismissal of Burton\u2019s petition <em>de novo. See id.</em></p>\n<p id=\"b817-5\">Pursuant to \u00a7 2244(d) of AEDPA, Burton\u2019s petition was untimely. However, Burton claims that he is actually innocent and that a showing of actual innocence is an exception to the limitations period. Assuming, without deciding, that an actual innocence exception exists, Burton has not made the requisite showing. <em>See Carriger v. Stewart, </em>132 F.3d 463, 478 (9th Cir.1997) (en banc). Ronald Washington\u2019s letter, alleging prosecutorial misconduct during Burton\u2019s trial, is not sufficient proof of Burton\u2019s innocence, given Derek Washington\u2019s similar testimony, inculpating Burton during trial.</p>\n<p id=\"b817-6\">Burton\u2019s contention that the limitations period did not begin to run until Ronald\u2019s letter was authenticated by the handwriting expert also fails. Burton was aware of the factual predicate for his actual innocence claim when Ronald\u2019s letter was received. <em>See Hasan v. Galaza, </em>254 F.3d 1150, 1154, n. 3 (9th Cir.2001) (holding \u201c[t]ime begins when the prisoner knows ... the important facts, not when the prisoner recognizes their legal significance.\u201d). Burton\u2019s petition was therefore, untimely.</p>\n<p id=\"b817-7\">Burton\u2019s equitable tolling arguments also fad. <em>See Calderon v. United States District Court (Beeler), </em>128 F.3d 1283 (9th Cir.1997), <em>overruled in part on other grounds by Calderon v. United States District Court (Kelly), </em>163 F.3d 530 (9th Cir. 1998) (en banc) (setting forth AEDPA standard of extraordinary circumstances beyond prisoner\u2019s control that made it impossible to file petition on time); <em>Allen v. Lewis, </em>255 F.3d 798, 799-801 (9th Cir. 2001) (\u201cIt will normally be much more difficult for a prisoner to demonstrate [that the \u2018extraordinary circumstances\u2019 were the but-for and proximate cause of untimeliness] where he encounters the \u2018extraordinary circumstances\u2019 in the beginning or middle of the limitations period than where he encounters them at the end of the limitations period.\u201d)</p>\n<p id=\"b817-9\">AFFIRMED.</p>\n<footnote label=\"**\">\n<p id=\"b816-18\"> This disposition is not appropriate for publication and may not be cited to or by the courts of this circuit except as may be provided by Ninth Circuit Rule 36-3.</p>\n</footnote>\n</opinion>\n</casebody>\n",
