Carlos OJEDA-SIERRA, also known as Carlos Garcia-Sierra, Defendant-Appellant.</parties>\n<docketnumber data-order=\"1\" data-type=\"docketnumber\" id=\"b897-9\">No. 01-4000.</docketnumber>\n<court data-order=\"2\" data-type=\"court\" id=\"b897-10\">United States Court of Appeals, Tenth Circuit.</court>\n<decisiondate data-order=\"3\" data-type=\"decisiondate\" id=\"b897-11\">July 31, 2001.</decisiondate>\n<p data-order=\"4\" data-type=\"judges\" id=\"b897-18\">Before HENRY, BRISCOE, and MURPHY, Circuit Judges.</p>\n<opinion data-order=\"5\" data-type=\"opinion\" id=\"x999-1\" type=\"majority\">\n<p id=\"b897-19\">ORDER AND JUDGMENT <footnotemark>*</footnotemark></p>\n<author id=\"Aeu\">HENRY, Circuit Judge.</author>\n<p id=\"b897-20\">After examining the briefs and appellate record, this panel has determined unanimously to honor the parties\u2019 request for decision on the briefs without oral argument. <em>See </em>Fed.R.App.P. 34(f). The case is therefore submitted without oral argument.</p>\n<p id=\"b897-21\">Mr. Ojeda-Sierra pleaded guilty to one count of illegal reentry following deportation in violation of 8 U.S.C. \u00a7 1326(a). He was sentenced to fifty-seven months\u2019 imprisonment, followed by thirty-six months\u2019 supervised release. The district court increased Mr. Ojeda-Sierra\u2019s base offense level by sixteen points pursuant to USSG \u00a7 2L1.2(b)(l)(A) because of his prior conviction for an aggravated felony. Mr. Ojeda-Sierra objected to the sixteen-level enhancement for having previously sustained an aggravated felony. We have jurisdiction pursuant to 28 U.S.C. \u00a7 1291 and 18 U.S.C. \u00a7 3742(a), and we affirm.</p>\n<p id=\"b897-22\">The basis for Mr. Ojeda-Sierra\u2019s argument is <em>Apprendi v. New Jersey, </em>530 U.S. 466, 490, 120 S.Ct. 2348, 147 L.Ed.2d 435 (2000). There the Supreme Court held that facts used to enhance the penalty for a crime beyond the statutory maximum must be submitted to a jury and proved beyond a reasonable doubt. Specifically he argues that, because he was neither <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"874\">*874</page-number>charged with, nor pleaded guilty to, the prior felony conviction, the sentencing court erred in relying on the prior conviction to enhance his sentence under 8 U.S.C. \u00a7 1326(b)(2).</p>\n<p id=\"b898-4\">Mr. Ojeda-Sierra concedes that his argument is foreclosed for the time being by <em>Almendarez-Torres v. United States, </em>523 U.S. 224, 247, 118 S.Ct. 1219, 140 L.Ed.2d 350 (1998), <em>see </em>Aplt\u2019s Br. at 3-4, but seeks to preserve his argument for review by the Supreme Court in anticipation that <em>Almendarez-Torres </em>will be overruled. He has done so. \u201cNevertheless, <em>Almendarez-Torres </em>has not been overruled and directly controls our decision in this case.\u201d <em>United States v.. Dorris, </em>236 F.3d 582, 587 (10th Cir.2000), <em>cert. denied, </em>\u2014 U.S.-, 121 S.Ct. 1635, 149 L.Ed.2d 495 (2001).</p>\n<p id=\"b898-7\">Accordingly, we AFFIRM Mr. OjedaSierra\u2019s sentence.</p>\n<footnote label=\"*\">\n<p id=\"b897-16\"> This order and judgment is not binding precedent, except under the doctrines of law of the case, res judicata, and collateral estoppel. The court generally disfavors the citation of orders and judgments; nevertheless, an order and judgment may be cited under the terms and conditions of 10th Cir.R. 36.3.</p>\n</footnote>\n</opinion>\n</casebody>\n",
