On appeal, he contests the district court\u2019s denial of his motion to suppress evidence discovered in the third-party residence in which he was arrested.</p>\n<p id=\"b871-10\">\n<em>Background</em>\n</p>\n<p id=\"b871-11\">On the morning of November 3, 1998, one Kansas and two Topeka police officers went to the home of Yvonne and Yvette Sugura, hoping to find Bruce Miles and execute a state warrant for his arrest.<footnotemark>1</footnotemark> II R. at 9-10, 13-14, 70. Prior attempts to locate and apprehend Mr. Miles at other addresses had been unsuccessful, <em>id. </em>at 56-57, 68, and an anonymous tip to the \u201cCrimeStoppers\u201d hotline had reported that Mr. Miles was \u201cstaying\u201d at the Suguras\u2019 home. <em>Id. </em>at 11-12. Yvonne Sugura met the police at the door. <em>Id. </em>at 12. In response to the officers\u2019 inquiries, she acknowledged that she had heard Mr. Miles\u2019 name before, pointed upstairs to her daughter Yvette\u2019s apartment, and invited them in to speak with Yvette [hereinafter \u201cMs. Sugura\u201d]. <em>Id. </em>at 12-13, 23-24, 66.</p>\n<p id=\"b871-16\">While one officer stood guard at an outside door, <em>id. </em>at 77-78, the other two went upstairs to Ms. Sugura\u2019s apartment. <em>Id. </em>at 13-14. The testimony is inconsistent as to whether the door was answered by Tony Solis (Ms. Sugura\u2019s boyfriend), <em>id. </em>at 13, or Kendra Zabala (Mr. Miles\u2019 then-girlfriend <footnotemark>2</footnotemark>). <em>Id. </em>at 59; <em>see also </em>V R. at 24. In any case, the police eventually spoke with Ms. Zabala, who told the officers that Ms. Sugura was asleep. II R. at 14-15. The officers\u2019 indicated that they needed to speak with Ms. Sugura and asked Ms. Zabala to wake her up. <em>Id.</em></p>\n<p id=\"b871-17\">Ms. Sugura came to the door, wrapped in a blanket, <em>id. </em>at 70, and told the officers \u201cthat she hadn\u2019t seen [Mr. Miles], [that] he hadn\u2019t been around.\u201d <em>Id. </em>at 15. When the officers asked to come in and look for him, Ms. Sugura replied \u201cI\u2019d rather you didn\u2019t.\u201d <em>Id. </em>As the officers attempted to persuade her, she stepped out into the hall. <em>Id. </em>at 15, 32. It was evident to the officers that she was very nervous. <em>Id. </em>at 15-16, 59-60, <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"848\">*848</page-number>70-71, 75-76; <em>see also id. </em>at 49. At one point, an officer informed her that if she was lying about Mr. Miles\u2019 presence in the apartment, she could be arrested for harboring a fugitive or aiding a felon. <em>Id. </em>at 31, 71. After \u201capproximately seven minutes,\u201d Aplt. Br. at 20,<footnotemark>3</footnotemark> Ms. Sugura admitted that Mr. Miles was in the apartment and consented to the officers\u2019 search. II R. at 34, 61. Immediately upon the officers\u2019 entry, Mr. Miles stepped forward. <em>Id. </em>at 17. One officer saw a gun in plain view and asked to whom it belonged; Mr. Miles admitted that the gun was his.<footnotemark>4</footnotemark> <em>Id. </em>at 17-18.</p>\n<p id=\"b872-4\">A grand jury returned a two-count indictment against Mr. Miles. I R., Doc. 1. When his motion to suppress the gun and certain incriminating statements was denied, I R., Doc. 32, Mr. Miles entered a conditional plea of guilty to Count I of the indictment \u2014 possessing a firearm after conviction of a felony.<footnotemark>5</footnotemark> I R., Doc. 36. This appeal followed.</p>\n<p id=\"b872-5\">\n<em>Discussion</em>\n</p>\n<p id=\"b872-6\">The question before us is whether the officers\u2019 entry into Yvette Sugura\u2019s apartment, upon which they discovered evidence tending to incriminate Mr. Miles, was reasonable under the Fourth Amendment despite the absence of a search warrant. The government argues that the search was justified by the officers\u2019 objectively reasonable belief that Mr. Miles was both living in and present in the apartment at the time of the search. Aplee Br. at 6-12; <em>see also Payton v. New York, </em>445 U.S. 573, 603, 100 S.Ct. 1371, 63 L.Ed.2d 639 (1980) (\u201c[A]n arrest warrant founded on probable case implicitly carries with it the limited authority to enter a dwelling <em>in which the suspect lives </em>when there is reason to believe the suspect is within.\u201d); <em>Valdez v. McPheters, </em>172 F.3d 1220, 1224-25 (10th Cir.1999) (holding that <em>Payton </em>does not require that the arrestee actually reside in the residence searched, provided that the officers had a \u201creasonable basis for believing that [the arrestee] both (1) lived in the residence and (2) could be found within at the time of entry\u201d). In the alternative, the government argues that Yvette Sugura consented to the search of her apartment, Aplee. Br. at 15-23, and that the search was supported by exigent circumstances. <em>Id. </em>at 12-15; <em>see also Steagald v. United States, </em>451 U.S. 204, 216, 101 S.Ct. 1642, 68 L.Ed.2d 38 (1981) (holding that arrest warrant does not authorize search of third-party dwelling in which arrestee does not reside in the absence of consent or exigent circumstances). Because we hold that Ms. Sugura\u2019s consent was valid, we need not address the government\u2019s other two arguments <em>(i.e., Payton/Valdez </em>and exigent circumstances).</p>\n<p id=\"b872-11\">Whether a party has voluntarily consented to a search is a question of fact that the district court must evaluate in light of the totality of the circumstances. <em>Schneckloth v. Bustamonte, </em>412 U.S. 218, 227, 93 S.Ct. 2041, 36 L.Ed.2d 854 (1973). In order to establish voluntariness, the government must \u201cproffer clear and positive testimony that consent was unequivocal and specific and freely and intelligently given\u201d and \u201cprove that this consent was given without implied or express duress or coercion.\u201d <em>United States v. McRae, </em>81 F.3d 1528, 1537 (10th Cir.1996) (internal <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"849\">*849</page-number>quotations and citation omitted). As with all questions of fact, when \u201c[r]eviewing the denial of a motion to suppress, we accept the district court\u2019s factual findings unless clearly erroneous.\u201d <em>United States v. Davis, </em>197 F.3d 1048, 1050 (10th Cir.1999) (citation omitted).</p>\n<p id=\"b873-5\">Upon a thorough examination of the record, we see no grounds to reject the district court\u2019s finding that Yvette Sugura voluntarily consented to the officers\u2019 limited search of her apartment. Doc. 32 at 17. Mr. Miles lists several factors that, in his opinion, \u201cestablish, at best, coerced acquiescence, not voluntary consent.\u201d Aplt. Br. at 19. He notes that the police threatened to arrest Ms. Sugura for harboring a fugitive, that more than one officer was present and that they \u201cwere in uniform with visible weapons,\u201d that she was not advised \u2014 in a consent form or otherwise\u2014 that she could refuse consent, that the encounter took place at her door when she had just awakened and was \u201cwrapped in a blanket,\u201d that the encounter lasted approximately seven minutes, and that she believed she had no choice but to consent. <em>Id. </em>at 19-20.<footnotemark>6</footnotemark> Although we emphasize that our ruling is based on a consideration of the totality of the circumstances, we will briefly discuss each of the above factors.</p>\n<p id=\"b873-6\">First, the officers\u2019 alleged \u201cthreats\u201d do not rise to the level of coercion or duress necessary to negate consent. During their brief encounter with Ms. Sugura, one officer truthfully informed her that she <em>could </em>be arrested for harboring a fugitive or aiding a felon if she was lying about Mr. Miles\u2019 presence in the apartment. II R. at 31, 71. Even generously construed as a \u201cthreat,\u201d this statement was not the type of threat that negates an otherwise voluntary consent. <em>See, e.g., United States v. Morrow, </em>731 F.2d 233, 236 (4th Cir.1984) (\u201cAlthough [the officer] did tell [the defendant] ... that she could be charged as an accessory ... that statement alone hardly amounts to duress or coercion .... \u201d); <em>see also United States v. Donaldson, </em>793 F.2d 498, 502 (2d Cir.1986) (holding, on similar facts, that \u201cwhen an investigation on the scene develops probable cause to arrest the third party [resident of] those premises for harboring the fugitive, a warrantless search [incident to the arrest] may then be made....\u201d). In this case, the officer\u2019s statement did not relate to Ms. Sugura\u2019s refusal to consent to the search, but only to her statements that Mr. Miles was not in the apartment. The officers never threatened to punish Ms. Sugura for refusing to consent, they merely advised her that harboring a fugitive was itself a crime, for which she could be arrested. Accordingly, the cases in which courts have found an officer\u2019s threats to negate consent are inapposite. <em>See, e.g., United States v. Bolin, </em>514 F.2d 554, 559-60 (7th Cir.1975) (holding consent not voluntary where police threatened to arrest defendant\u2019s girlfriend if he refused to sign consent form); <em>Waldron v. United States, </em>219 F.2d 37, 39 (D.C.Cir.1955) (consent not voluntary where \u201cpolice \u2018said if they had to get a search warrant, that it wouldn\u2019t be their responsibility of [sic] what happened to what was in the apartment, and if I were to let them in on my own free will, that <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"850\">*850</page-number>they would put everything back where they got it\u2019 \u201d).</p>\n<p id=\"b874-4\">The other factors cited in Mr. Miles\u2019 brief are equally unpersuasive. We see no clear error in the district court\u2019s finding that only three officers were involved in the encounter at issue. I R., Doc, 32 at 6; <em>ef. supra </em>note 1. There is nothing unusual or inherently coercive about the presence of three uniformed and armed officers. Although it is true that pressure <em>on a detainee </em>to consent to a search may be increased by the presence of more than one officer and by an officer\u2019s failure to advise the individual of his right to refuse the officer\u2019s request, <em>United States v. Orrego-Fernandez, </em>78 F.3d 1497, 1505 (10th Cir.1996), Yvette Sugura was not a detainee \u2014 she was in her own home. Even in the detention context, moreover, neither factor is dispositive. <em>Id.; accord United States v. Fernandez, </em>18 F.3d 874, 882 (10th Cir.1994). Nor it is necessary that officers obtain a signed consent form in order to insulate an otherwise knowing and voluntary oral consent against attack. <em>See Schneckloth, </em>412 U.S. at 231, 93 S.Ct. 2041.</p>\n<p id=\"b874-5\">The record indicates that Ms. Sugura chose to come to the door wrapped in a blanket. II R. at 70. Although a person\u2019s \u201cvulnerable subjective state\u201d is one factor to consider in determining whether consent was voluntary, <em>Schneckloth, </em>412 U.S. at 229, 93 S.Ct. 2041, we are persuaded that Ms. Sugura\u2019s consent was voluntary despite her chosen attire \u2014 or lack thereof. <em>Cf. United States v. Dickerson, </em>975 F.2d 1245, 1249 (7th Cir.1992) (holding that naked man \u201cvoluntarily consented\u201d to warrantless entry by four police officers who appeared, weapons drawn, at his front door, and physically prevented him from shutting it). The brief duration of the encounter is also unobjectionable. II R. at 60 (two minutes); Aplt. Br. at 20 (\u201capproximately seven minutes\u201d); II R. at 78-79 (five to ten minutes). Finally, Ms. Sugura\u2019s own testimony contradicts Mr. Miles\u2019 assertion that she believed she had no choice but to consent. <em>E.g., </em>II R. at 45 (Ms. Sugura: nothing she \u201cdid in discussing anything with the officers\u201d was \u201cdone involuntarily\u201d); <em>id. </em>at 53 (Ms. Sugura: \u201cI didn\u2019t really care if [the officers] came in. I just wanted them to get [Mr. Miles] and leave my house.\u201d). The district court did not clearly err in crediting Ms. Sugura\u2019s testimony as to her own state of mind. <em>See United States v. Hernandez, </em>93 F.3d 1493, 1498 (10th Cir.1996) (\u201cEvaluation of the credibility of the witnesses, the weight to be given the evidence, and inference to be drawn from the evidence are for the district court.\u201d).</p>\n<p id=\"b874-7\">Accordingly, the district court\u2019s denial of Mr. Miles\u2019 motion to suppress was not error and the judgment is AFFIRMED.</p>\n<footnote label=\"**\">\n<p id=\"b871-13\"> This order and judgment is not binding precedent, except under the doctrines of law of the case, res judicata, and collateral estoppel. This court generally disfavors the citation of orders and judgments; nevertheless, an order and judgment may be cited under the terms and conditions of 10th Cir. R. 36.3.</p>\n</footnote>\n<footnote label=\"1\">\n<p id=\"b871-14\">. Yvette Sugura testified that the officers were accompanied by five or six United States Marshals. II R. at 41-42. The officers did not recall whether marshals were present, but conceded that it was possible. <em>Id. </em>at 26-27, 68. <em>But see id. </em>at 76 (noting that presence of additional officers would have been reflected in contemporaneous reports of the encounter). The district court found that only three officers were present. I R., Doc. 32 at 6.</p>\n</footnote>\n<footnote label=\"2\">\n<p id=\"b871-19\">. Officer Mechler testified that Ms. Sugura referred to Mr. Miles as \"her <em>roommate\u2019s </em>boyfriend\u201d. II R. at 70 (emphasis added). There is no other indication that Ms. Zabala resided in the apartment.</p>\n</footnote>\n<footnote label=\"3\">\n<p id=\"b872-7\">. <em>But cf. </em>II R. at 60 (Off. Mechler: two minutes elapsed between initial knock and Ms. Sugura\u2019s consent); <em>id. </em>at 78-79 (Off. Cochran: encounter lasted five to ten minutes).</p>\n</footnote>\n<footnote label=\"4\">\n<p id=\"b872-8\">. Mr. Miles has waived his <em>Miranda </em>claim on appeal. See <em>Coleman v. B-G Maint. Mgmt. of Colo., Inc., </em>108 F.3d 1199, 1205 (10th Cir. 1997).</p>\n</footnote>\n<footnote label=\"5\">\n<p id=\"b872-14\">. In exchange, the government agreed to dismiss Count II. Ill R., Att. at 2, K 3(a); IV R. at 4.</p>\n</footnote>\n<footnote label=\"6\">\n<p id=\"b873-7\">. Mr. Miles also lists \"fear and intimidation\u201d as a relevant factor, but it is unclear whether he is referring to the officers\u2019 methods or Yvette Sugura's state of mind. Aplt. Br. at 20. Neither is supported by the record. The only testimony as to the officers' allegedly intimidating manner \u201cis Ms. Sugura\u2019s testimony, when led by defense counsel, that Officer Mechler looked at her '[k]ind of sternly?\u2019 and \u2018[k]ind of intimidating?\u2019 \u201d Aplee. Br. at 18-19 (quoting II R. at 49). In Ms. Sugura\u2019s own words, Officer Mechler \u201cjust looked at me like 'Are you lying,' kind of ... I think she was looking at me to kind of tell whether I was lying or not____\" HR. at 48-49.</p>\n</footnote>\n</opinion>\n</casebody>\n",
