Greathouse argues that the Border Patrol did not have probable cause to search the motor home he was driving and that all evidence discovered during that search, including , the 61 illegal aliens found in the motor home, should therefore be suppressed. We vacated the district court\u2019s first denial of Greathouse\u2019s motion and remanded due to the lack of factual findings. <em>See United States v. Greathouse, </em>225 F.3d 664 (9th Cir.2000) (unpublished disposition). On remand, the district court again held an evidentiary hearing and again denied Greathouse\u2019s motion. That denial is the subject of this appeal. We have jurisdiction pursuant to 28 U.S.C. \u00a7 1291, and we affirm.</p>\n<p id=\"b650-14\">The search at issue occurred at the Border Patrol\u2019s fixed checkpoint near Pine Valley, California. Searches conducted at fixed border patrol checkpoints are constitutional only if justified \u201cby consent or probable cause.\u201d <em>United States v. Martinez-Fuerte, </em>428 U.S. 543, 567, 96 S.Ct. 3074, 49 L.Ed.2d 1116 (1976). Neither party disputes that the motor home was \u201csearched\u201d without consent and that the Border Patrol agent\u2019s actions must therefore be supported by \u201cprobable cause.\u201d We review findings of probable cause de novo. <em>United States v. Rojas-Millan, </em>234 F.3d 464, 468 (9th Cir.2000). A district court\u2019s findings of fact such as whether a witness is credible are reviewed for clear error. <em>United States v. Clawson, </em>831 F.2d 909, 914 (9th Cir.1987). Moreover, \u201c[w]hen findings are based on trial court <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"627\">*627</page-number>determinations regarding the credibility of witnesses, even greater deference is given to the court\u2019s findings.\u201d <em>Trent v. Valley Elec. Ass\u2019n, </em>195 F.3d 534, 538 (9th Cir. 1999).</p>\n<p id=\"b651-5\">The district court found the following: (1) The Border Patrol agent\u2019s testimony was credible; (2) Although it was the middle of the day, all of the motor home\u2019s windows were closed and covered by curtains; (3) A makeshift curtain hung behind the driver and front passenger seats preventing anyone from seeing into the living-area of the motor home; (4) The frame of the motor home was riding extremely low to the ground; (5) Greathouse acted suspiciously because he did not initially follow the agent\u2019s directions; (6) When the secondary inspection agent knocked on the motor home\u2019s door it opened a few inches; and (7) Through the open door, the agent saw movement inside the motor home. These findings are not clearly erroneous.</p>\n<p id=\"b651-6\">We agree with the district court\u2019s conclusion that a reasonable person, viewing the facts and circumstances as the Border Patrol agent saw them, would have probable cause to believe that the motor home contained contraband or evidence of a crime. <em>See Ornelas v. United States, </em>517 U.S. 690, 696, 116 S.Ct. 1657, 134 L.Ed.2d 911 (1996) (finding that probable cause exists \u201cwhere the known facts and circumstances are sufficient to warrant a man of reasonable prudence in the belief that contraband or evidence of a crime will be found\u201d). Because the Border Patrol agents had probable cause to conduct the search, we need not reach the district court\u2019s alternative conclusion that exigent circumstances justified the search.</p>\n<p id=\"Ak6\">AFFIRMED.</p>\n<footnote label=\"*\">\n<p id=\"b650-10\"> This disposition is inappropriate for publication and may not be cited to or by the courts of this circuit except as may be provided by 9th Cir.
