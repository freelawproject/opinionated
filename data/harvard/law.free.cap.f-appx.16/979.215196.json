R.App. P. 34(a); 10th Cir. R. 34.1(G).

Mr. Pierce was convicted of aggravated robbery and kidnapping in state court and sentenced to thirty years to life imprisonment. R. doc. 9, at 2. Mr. Pierce filed two habeas petitions in federal court,<footnotemark>1</footnotemark> which the district court consolidated and denied. <em>Id. </em>at 6. The court also denied Mr. Pierce a COA. R. doc. 16, at 2. We have jurisdiction under 28 U.S.C. \u00a7 2253(c) and likewise deny Mr. Pierce a COA.</p>\n<p id=\"b1004-6\">The district court rejected Mr. Pierce\u2019s arguments in his first petition, R. doc. 1, that (1) he did not commit a burglary in Montgomery County, Alabama that was included in his criminal history, (2) he had ineffective assistance of counsel because the trial court refused to appoint substitute counsel, and (3) he waived a preliminary hearing so that substitute counsel could be appointed. The district court also rejected Mr. Pierce\u2019s argument in his second petition, R. doc. 1 (D. Ct. Case No. 00-3408), that he is unlawfully confined because the state court clerk refused to file his appeal because of his inability to pay the filing fee.</p>\n<p id=\"b1004-7\">A COA should issue only if Mr. Pierce \u201chas made a substantial showing of the denial of a constitutional right.\u201d 28 U.S.C. \u00a7 2253(c)(2). He has failed to make this showing on the only issues he seeks to appeal. <em>See </em>Pet. Br. at 1 (filed Mar. 19, 2001); Pet. Supp. Br. at 2-3 (filed July 2, 2001). He has not overcome the presumption accorded to state factual findings, 28 U.S.C. \u00a7 2254(e)(1); the Kansas Court of Appeals rejected Mr. Pierce\u2019s post-conviction claim that his criminal history was inaccurate based upon the Montgomery, Alabama conviction. <em>Pierce v. Kansas, </em>No. 83,506, Memo. Op. at 2 (Kan. Ct.App. Apr. 7, 2000). The letter attached to his brief written by Carol Lucero, Sentence Computation Unit, Kansas Department of Corrections is not to the contrary. Pet. Br. ex. A. The letter informs Mr. Pierce that Ms. Lucero contacted the Court Administrator in Montgomery County Alabama and confirmed that Mr. Pierce was \u201cindeed convicted\u201d of burglary. <em>Id. </em>Mr. Pierce was therefore informed that this conviction would \u201cremain part of [his] criminal history.\u201d <em>Id. </em>Thus, the letter refutes Mr. Pierce\u2019s contention. Needless to say, Mr. Pierce has not shown \u201cthat reasonable jurists would find the district court\u2019s assessment of the constitutional claims debatable or wrong.\u201d <em>Slack v. McDaniel, </em>529 U.S. 473, 484, 120 S.Ct. 1595, 146 L.Ed.2d 542 (2000).</p>\n<p id=\"b1004-11\">Accordingly, Mr. Pierce\u2019s COA application is DENIED and his petition is DISMISSED.</p>\n<footnote label=\"**\">\n<p id=\"b1004-9\"> This order and judgment is not binding precedent, except under the doctrines of law of the case, res judicata, and collateral estoppel. This court generally disfavors the citation of orders and judgments; nevertheless, an order and judgment may be cited under the terms and conditions of 10th Cir. R. 36.3.</p>\n</footnote>\n<footnote label=\"1\">\n<p id=\"b1004-14\">.
