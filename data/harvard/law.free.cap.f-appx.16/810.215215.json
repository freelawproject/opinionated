We have jurisdiction under 28 U.S.C. \u00a7 1291, and we affirm.</p>\n<p id=\"b835-19\">Gleason contends that his guilty plea conviction is invalid because the district court violated Federal Rule of Criminal Procedure 11 by failing to: (1) explain the nature of the charge to which Gleason was pleading guilty, <em>see </em>Fed.R.Crim.P. 11(c)(1); (2) insure the voluntary nature of the guilty plea, <em>see </em>Fed.R.Crim.P. 11(d); and (3) establish an adequate factual basis for the plea, <em>see </em>Fed.R.Crim.P. 11(f). The record shows, however, that these requirements were satisfied. <em>See United States v. Rivera-Ramirez, </em>715 F.2d 453, 457 (9th Cir.1983) (stating that in explaining the nature of the charges, \u201cinformation provided the defendant is sufficient if it provides Mm \u2018an understanding of the law in relation to the facts\u2019 and thus permits a voluntary plea\u201d) (quoting <em>McCarthy v. United States, </em>394 U.S. 459, 466, 89 S.Ct. 1166, 22 L.Ed.2d 418 (1969)); <em>United States v, Rubalcaba, </em>811 F.2d 491, 494 (9th Cir.1987) (noting that \u201c[sjolemn declarations in open court carry a strong presumption of verity\u201d in rejecting later claim of involuntariness of guilty plea) (quotation omitted); <em>United States v. Timbana, </em>222 F.3d 688, 703 (9th Cir.) (concluding that adequate factual basis existed where defendant agreed in open court with description of his actions which satisfied the elements of the offense), <em>cert. denied, </em>531 U.S. 1028, 121 S.Ct. 604, 148 L.Ed.2d 516 (2000).</p>\n<p id=\"b836-3\"><page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"812\">*812</page-number>Gleason also contends the district court erred by denying his motions for withdrawal of his guilty plea and substitution of counsel without conducting evidentiary hearings. We review for abuse of discretion both the district court\u2019s denial of such motions, <em>United States v. Alber, </em>56 F.3d 1106, 1111 (9th Cir.1995) (withdrawal of guilty plea); <em>United States v. Musa, </em>220 F.3d 1096, 1102 (9th Cir.2000) (substitution of counsel), <em>cert. denied, </em>531 U.S. 999, 121 S.Ct. 498, 148 L.Ed.2d 469, and its decision not to hold an evidentiary hearing, <em>United States v. Smith, </em>155 F.3d 1051, 1063 n. 18 (9th Cir.1998).</p>\n<p id=\"b836-4\">The district court did not abuse its discretion by denying Gleason\u2019s motions. Gleason\u2019s post hoc statements concerning his counsel\u2019s alleged misrepresentations do not belie his statements made under oath at the change of plea hearing establishing that he was satisfied with counsel, that no promises had been made that he would receive a particular sentence, and that he was pleading guilty knowingly and voluntarily. <em>See Rubalcaba, supra, </em>811 F.2d at 494. Gleason, therefore, has failed to show a \u201cfair and just\u201d reason for withdrawal of his guilty plea. <em>See id. </em>at 493 (stating that withdrawal of guilty plea is appropriate where the plea is \u201cshown to have been unfairly obtained or given through ignorance, fear or inadvertence\u201d) (quoting <em>Kercheval v. United States, </em>274 U.S. 220, 224, 47 S.Ct. 582, 71 L.Ed. 1009 (1927)). In addition, new counsel was not required where Gleason presented no evidence that he and his attorney suffered from a lack of communication that impeded the presentation of an adequate defense. <em>See United States v. Ono, </em>997 F.2d 647, 650 (9th Cir.1993).</p>\n<p id=\"b836-5\">Finally, evidentiary hearings on the motions were unnecessary where, even had Gleason requested such hearings, testimony from live witnesses would have been largely cumulative of evidence that the court had already received. <em>See Smith, </em>155 F.3d at 1063 n. 18. The district court therefore did not abuse its discretion in denying Gleason\u2019s motions without holding an evidentiary hearing.<footnotemark>1</footnotemark></p>\n<p id=\"b836-6\">AFFIRMED.</p>\n<footnote label=\"**\">\n<p id=\"b835-16\"> This disposition is not appropriate for publication and may not be cited to or by the courts of this circuit except as may be provided by 9th Cir.

To the extent Gleason raises a free-standing claim of ineffective assistance of counsel in this appeal, we decline to consider his claim. <em>See United States v.
