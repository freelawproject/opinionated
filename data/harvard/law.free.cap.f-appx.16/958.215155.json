R.App. P. 34(a)(2); 10th Cir. R. 34.1(G). The case is therefore ordered submitted without oral argument.</p>\n<p id=\"b982-21\">Defendant Mack F. Flynn appeals the district court\u2019s order denying his motion for release pending appeal. Mr. Flynn entered pleas' of guilty to the charges of possession with intent to distribute methamphetamine, possession of a firearm during and in relation to a drug trafficking offense, interstate transportation in aid of racketeering, and receipt or transport of a firearm while under indictment. He was sentenced to 120 months\u2019 imprisonment on the first charge, and sixty months\u2019 each on each of the remaining charges, with two sentences to run consecutively, for a total of 180 months. The district court issued a minute order denying release pending appeal.</p>\n<p id=\"b982-22\">Because Mr. Flynn was convicted of crimes described in 18 U.S.C. \u00a7 3142(f)(1)(A), 18 U.S.C. \u00a7 3143(b)(2) requires that he \u201cbe detained.\u201d He may be released pending appeal, however, if he meets the conditions of 18 U.S.C. \u00a7 3143(b)(1)(A) &amp; (B), that he is not a flight risk or a danger to others or the community, and that the appeal is not for delay and raises a substantial question of law or fact likely to result in reversal. In <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"959\">*959</page-number>addition, he must \u201cclearly show[ ] that there are exceptional reasons why [his] detention would not be appropriate.\u201d 18 U.S.C. \u00a7 3145(c).</p>\n<p id=\"b983-4\">Mr. Flynn argues that he has met the criteria required for release on bail. He has not, however, shown a substantial question of law or fact likely to result in reversal. <em>See United States v. Klinginsmith, </em>25 F.3d 1507, 1508-10 (10th Cir. 1994). Moreover, even if Mr. Flynn met the basic requirements for release pending appeal, which he has not, doing so would not qualify as \u201cexceptional reasons\u201d for his release. Accordingly, the order denying Mr. Flynn\u2019s request for release pending appeal is AFFIRMED.</p>\n<footnote label=\"*\">\n<p id=\"b982-16\"> This order and judgment is not binding precedent, except under the doctrines of law of the case, res judicata, and collateral estoppel. The court generally disfavors the citation of orders and judgments; nevertheless, an order and judgment may be cited under the terms and conditions of 10th Cir. R. 36.3.</p>\n</footnote>\n</opinion>\n</casebody>\n",
