Navarro-Macias petitions for review, arguing that simple possession alone cannot be an \u201caggravated felony,\u201d and that his removal order violates the Fifth and Eighth Amendments. We dismiss this petition for lack of jurisdiction.</p>\n<p id=\"b494-15\">Navarro-Macias was indicted in Cook County, Illinois in March 1996 for the felony of simple possession of less than 30 grams of phencyclidine, or PCP, in violation of 720 ILCS 570/402(c). He was convicted, and in December 1996 sentenced to a two-year term of probation. In April 1997, while still on probation, Navarro-Macias was arrested and charged by information with two counts of possession with intent to distribute less than 10 grams of PCP within 1000 feet of a school or church in violation of 720 ILCS 570/401(e), 407(b)(3), and one count of possession of a controlled substance with intent to deliver in violation of 720 ILCS 570/401(d). Based on the new charges, an Illinois court found Navarro-Macias in violation of his probation, and sentenced him in December 1997 to a three-year prison term. At the same time, he pleaded guilty under the information to one count of the lesser-included felony offense of simple possession of a controlled substance in exchange for dismissal of the possession-with-intent-to-distribute charges. He was sentenced to a concurrent eighteen-month prison term. \\</p>\n<p id=\"b494-16\">In 1998 the Immigration and Naturalization Service (\u201cINS\u201d) charged Navarro-Macias as removable under 8 U.S.C. \u00a7 1227(a)(2)(A)(iii) for being convicted of an aggravated felony, and under 8 U.S.C. \u00a7 1227(a)(2)(B)(i) for being convicted of a crime related to a controlled substance. Specifically, the INS charged that Navarro-Macias had three convictions warranting his removal: the two Illinois felony convictions for simple possession, and an Illinois felony conviction for possession of a controlled substance with intent to distribute. Navarro-Macias admitted the two simple possession convictions but denied being convicted of possession with intent to distribute. The Immigration Judge (\u201cIJ\u201d) found that the possession-with-in<page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"471\">*471</page-number>tent-to-distribute conviction could not be substantiated, but concluded that the two simple possession convictions were sufficiently established and rendered Navarro-Macias removable as both an aggravated felon and a drug offender. The IJ ordered Navarro-Macias deported to Mexico.</p>\n<p id=\"b495-5\">Navarro-Macias appealed to the BIA. The BIA applied a two-prong test first announced in <em>Matter of Davis, </em>20 I &amp; N Dec. 536, 1992 WL 443920 (B.I.A.1992), and <em>Matter of Barrett, </em>20 I &amp; N Dec. 171, 1990 WL 385754 (B.I.A.1990) (the <em>\u2018Davis/Barrett </em>test\u201d), to determine whether Navarro-Macias had committed an aggravated felony as defined in 8 U.S.C. \u00a7 1101(a)(43)(B). Under the <em>Davis/Barrett </em>test, a state controlled substance conviction qualifies as an \u201caggravated felony\u201d if it is (1) a felony under state law and has a sufficient nexus to unlawful trading or dealing in controlled substances to be considered \u201cillicit trafficking\u201d as commonly defined, or (2) analogous to a \u201cdrug trafficking crime\u201d as defined in 18 U.S.C. \u00a7 924(c)(2). The BIA applied the second prong of the test and determined that Navarro-Macias\u2019s second conviction was analogous to a felony violation of 21 U.S.C. \u00a7 844(a). Because 18 U.S.C. \u00a7 924(c)(2) defines \u201cdrug trafficking crime\u201d as \u201cany felony punishable under the Controlled Substances Act (21 U.S.C. \u00a7 801 <em>et seq.),\u201d </em>the BIA concluded that he was removable as an aggravated felon. The BIA then dismissed Navarro-Macias\u2019s appeal and entered a final order of removal.</p>\n<p id=\"b495-7\">At the outset, the government urges us to dismiss this appeal for lack of jurisdiction. Under the amendments to the INA added by the Illegal Immigration Reform and Immigrant Responsibility Act of 1996, we lack jurisdiction to review final orders of removal entered against aliens removable for having committed an aggravated felony. 8 U.S.C. \u00a7 1252(a)(2)(C). Despite the jurisdictional bar, we retain jurisdiction to determine our jurisdiction-that is, to determine whether Navarro-Macias\u2019s crimes fit within one of the provisions triggering the jurisdictional bar. <em>Hernandez-Mancilla v. INS, </em>246 F.3d 1002, 1004 (7th Cir.2001); <em>Lara-Ruiz v. INS, </em>241 F.3d 934, 939 (7th Cir.2001); <em>Solorzano-Patlan v. INS, </em>207 F.3d 869, 872 (7th Cir.2000). Moreover, we retain jurisdiction under the \u201csafety valve\u201d exception, whereby a deportee can raise substantial constitutional claims that the BIA lacks authority to address. <em>See Lara-Ruiz, </em>241 F.3d at 939. Safety valve jurisdiction is an exceptional procedure, however, and our jurisdiction is limited to reviewing substantial constitutional claims and preventing \u201cbizarre miscarriages of justice.\u201d <em>Id. </em>(quoting <em>LaGuerre v. Reno, </em>164 F.3d 1035, 1040 (7th Cir.1998)). We conduct both jurisdictional inquiries <em>de novo. Solorzano-Patlan, </em>207 F.3d at 872.</p>\n<p id=\"b495-9\">For purposes of drug offenses, the INA defines aggravated felony as \u201cillicit trafficking in a controlled substance (as defined in section 802 of Title 21), including a drug trafficking crime (as defined in section 924(c) of Title 18).\u201d 8 U.S.C. \u00a7 1101(a)(43)(B). Section 924(c) in turn defines \u201cdrug trafficking crime\u201d as \u201cany felony punishable under the Controlled Substances Act (21 U.S.C. \u00a7 801 <em>et </em>seq.)....\u201d 18 U.S.C. \u00a7 924(c)(2). Thus, a state conviction for simple possession of a controlled substance is both a drug trafficking crime and an aggravated felony under the INA if it (1) is punishable under the Controlled Substances Act (\u201cCSA\u201d) and (2) qualifies as a felony. <em>Amaral v. INS, </em>977 F.3d 33, 36-37 (1st Cir.1992). The CSA further defines \u201cfelony\u201d as \u201cany Federal or State offense classified by applicable Federal or State law as a felony.\u201d 21 U.S.C. \u00a7 802(13); <em>see also </em>21 U.S.C. \u00a7 802(44) (defining \u201cfelony drug offense\u201d as \u201can offense punishable by imprisonment for more than one year under any law of the United States or of a State ... that <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"472\">*472</page-number>prohibits or restricts conduct relating to narcotic drugs, marihuana, or depressant or stimulant substances\u201d).</p>\n<p id=\"b496-4\">Navarro-Macias\u2019s Illinois convictions for simple possession constitute at least one drug trafficking crime and hence an aggravated felony. Both of his convictions were felonies under Illinois law, 720 ILCS 570/402(c), and thus felonies as defined in the CSA, 21 U.S.C. \u00a7 802(13). Each crime would also have been punishable under the CSA. PCP is a controlled substance, 21 U.S.C. \u00a7 812(c), Sch. III(b)(7), and simple possession of a controlled substance violates 21 U.S.C. \u00a7 844(a). A simple violation of \u00a7 844(a) is only a Class A misdemeanor because it is punishable by no more than one year in prison. <em>See </em>18 U.S.C. \u00a7 3559(a)(6). But a violation of \u00a7 844(a) after a prior conviction \u201cfor any drug, narcotic, or chemical, offense chargeable under the law of any State\u201d raises the maximum prison term to two years, making the crime a Class E felony. <em>See </em>18 U.S.C. \u00a7 3559(a)(5). Therefore, Navarro-Macias\u2019s second state felony conviction was not only analogous to a felony under the CSA, it was also a drug trafficking crime under 18 U.S.C. \u00a7 924(c)(2) and an aggravated felony under 8 U.S.C. \u00a7 1101(a)(43)(B). <em>See Amaral, </em>977 F.2d at 36.</p>\n<p id=\"b496-6\">Navarro-Macias asserts that the term \u201cdrug trafficking crime\u201d should not include mere simple possession because \u201cdrug trafficking crime\u201d is commonly understood to mean \u201ctrading in controlled substances, i.e., possession with intent to distribute.\u201d He relies on two cases from this circuit, <em>Young v. United States, </em>124 F.3d 794 (7th Cir.1997), and <em>United States v. Nash, </em>876 F.2d 1359 (7th Cir.1989), but neither case helps him here. The relevant question in <em>Young </em>was whether a defendant could be charged with carrying or using a weapon in connection with a drug trafficking crime under 18 U.S.C. \u00a7 924(c)(1) when the defendant possessed the drugs but not the weapon at his arrest. <em>See Young, </em>124 F.3d at 800. The definition of drug trafficking crime was not discussed. And although <em>Nash </em>suggests that simple possession of a controlled substance is not a drug trafficking crime under \u00a7 924(c)(2), <em>see </em>876 F.2d at 1362, Congress has since amended the provision. In 1988, Congress broadened the definition of drug trafficking crime under \u00a7 924(c)(2) to encompass \u201cany felony punishable under the Controlled Substances Act (21 U.S.C. \u00a7 801 <em>et seq.).\u201d See United States v. Valenzuela-Esealante, </em>130 F.3d 944, 946-47 (10th Cir.1997). The former version of \u00a7 924(c)(2) had defined drug trafficking crime merely as \u201cany violation of Federal law involving the <em>distribution, manufacture, or importation </em>of any controlled substance.\u201d <em>See Nash, </em>876 F.2d at 1361 (emphasis added).</p>\n<p id=\"b496-8\">Next, Navarro-Macias argues that it was inappropriate for the BIA to rely on \u00a7 844(a)\u2019s \u201csentencing enhancement provision\u201d in determining that he committed an aggravated felony. The provision of \u00a7 844(a) making its violation a felony based on a prior conviction \u201cfor any drug, narcotic, or chemical, offense chargeable under the law of any State,\u201d Navarro-Macias contends, is a sentencing factor rather than an element of the crime that cannot control whether his second Illinois conviction for simple possession would have been chargeable as a felony under the CSA. Prior convictions may not be used to increase a sentence beyond the misdemeanor level unless the government files an enhancement information under 21 U.S.C. \u00a7 851 listing the prior convictions. We recently held, however, that the \u00a7 851 filing requirement does not govern whether a state simple possession conviction would be chargeable as a felony in federal court. <em>See United States v. Irby, </em>240 F.3d 597, 600 (7th Cir.2001). An offense constitutes a felony merely if it is punishable by more than one year of imprisonment. <em>Id. </em><page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"473\">*473</page-number>The \u00a7 851 enhancement information requirement therefore does not affect Navarro-Macias; his second Illinois felony conviction was sufficient to constitute a felony punishable under the CSA. <em>See id.</em></p>\n<p id=\"b497-5\">Navarro-Macias also contends that the BIA, in determining whether he was an aggravated felon, misapplied two of its own precedent decisions, <em>Matter of K-V-D-, </em>Int. Dec. 3422, 1999 WL 1186808 (B.I.A.1999), and <em>In re L-G-, </em>21 I &amp; N Dec. 89, 1995 WL 582051 (B.I.A.1995). In both cases the BIA reversed decisions in which the IJ found the alien deportable as an aggravated felon on the basis of a single state simple-possession conviction. The BIA\u2019s reasoning in these decisions, however, does not apply to Navarro-Macias\u2019s case because his second Illinois simple possession conviction could have been prosecuted as a felony under 21 U.S.C. \u00a7 844(a). <em>See Amaral, </em>977 F.2d at 36.</p>\n<p id=\"b497-6\">Finally, Navarro-Macias raises two arguments under the safety valve exception. We have jurisdiction to review these constitutional claims only if they are substantial. <em>Larar-Ruiz, </em>241 F.3d at 939. He contends first that the BIA violated his equal protection rights by ordering him removed as an aggravated felon under 8 U.S.C. \u00a7 1127(a)(2)(A)(iii) rather than for having committed a crime related to a controlled substance under 8 U.S.C. \u00a7 1127(a)(2)(B)(i).<footnotemark>1</footnotemark> Navarro-Macias asserts that the BIA singled him out based on the \u201cimpermissible classification\u201d of \u201crecidivism.\u201d This claim is insubstantial. Convicted felons are not a suspect class, <em>United States v. Wicks, </em>132 F.3d 383, 389 (7th Cir.1997), and Congress may permissibly create special preferences or disadvantages based on immigration classifications so long as it has a facially legitimate and bona fide reason for doing so, <em>Lara-Ruiz, </em>241 F.3d at 947 (citing <em>Fiallo v. Bell, </em>430 U.S. 787, 794, 97 S.Ct. 1473, 52 L.Ed.2d 50 (1977)); <em>see also Garcia v. INS, </em>7 F.3d 1320, 1327 (7th Cir.1993) (Congress\u2019 decision to subject aliens convicted of controlled substance offenses to harsh consequences rests on a facially legitimate, bona fide reason).</p>\n<p id=\"b497-9\">Navarro-Macias next asserts that the harsh consequences of removal as an aggravated felon are disproportionate to the gravity of his criminal convictions and thus constitute cruel and unusual punishment in violation of the Eighth Amendment. Removal undoubtedly can be a harsh measure and may \u201cpunish\u201d an alien more severely than would a criminal conviction and sentence. <em>See Groza v. INS, </em>30 F.3d 814, 822 (7th Cir.1994). But Congress\u2019 power to expel aliens is plenary-a \u201cfundamental sovereign attribute exercised by the Government\u2019s political departments largely immune from judicial control.\u201d <em>Fiallo, </em>430 U.S. at 792. Congress may make rules in the immigration context that would be unacceptable if applied to citizens. <em>Id. </em>at 792. Here, Congress has chosen a harsh penalty for a broad class of controlled substance offenders, and Navarro-Macias fits within the class. Moreover, <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"474\">*474</page-number>removal proceedings are civil not criminal in nature, and deportation is not \u201cpunishment\u201d within the ambit of the Eighth Amendment. <em>Carlson v. Landon, </em>342 U.S. 524, 537-38, 72 S.Ct. 525, 96 L.Ed. 547 (1952); <em>Harisiades v. Shaughnessy, </em>342 U.S. 580, 594, 72 S.Ct. 512, 96 L.Ed. 586 (1952); <em>cf. United States v. Guzman, </em>236 F.3d 830, 834 (7th Cir.2001) (removal after conviction and incarceration does not raise double jeopardy concerns).</p>\n<p id=\"b498-4\">In sum, Juan Navarro-Macias\u2019s two Illinois felony convictions for simple possession of PGP constituted a drug trafficking crime as defined in 18 U.S.C. \u00a7 924(c). He therefore committed an aggravated felony as defined in 8 U.S.C. \u00a7 1101(a)(43)(B), and we lack jurisdiction to review his order of removal. Accordingly, we DISMISS this petition for review.</p>\n<footnote label=\"1\">\n<p id=\"b497-7\">. We lack jurisdiction to review a final order of removal based on either classification. <em>See </em>8 U.S.C. \u00a7 1252(a)(2)(C). Nevertheless, for Navarro-Macias this is an important distinction: permanent residents deported for committing aggravated felonies are ineligible for most forms of discretionary relief such as asylum, discretionary cancellation of removal, and voluntary departure. Aggravated felons also may not apply for readmission to the United States without the consent of the Attorney General, and are ineligible for a waiver. <em>See Guerrero-Perez v. INS, </em>242 F.3d 727, 737 (7th Cir.2001). Moreover, aliens convicted under 8 U.S.C. \u00a7 1324 for unauthorized re-entry into the United States are subject to a substantial sentencing enhancement under U.S.S.G. \u00a7 2L1.2 if they were previously removed for committing an aggravated felony. <em>See United States v. Martinez-Carillo, </em>250 F.3d 1101, 1102 (7th Cir.2001).</p>\n</footnote>\n</opinion>\n</casebody>\n",
