Lee\u2019s attorney has filed a brief in accordance with <em>Anders v. California, </em>386 U.S. 738, 87 S.Ct. 1396, 18 L.Ed.2d 493 (1967), raising three issues but stating that, in his view, there are no meritorious grounds for appeal. Lee was informed of his right to file a pro se supplemental brief, but he failed to do so.</p>\n<p id=\"b247-6\">The charges against Lee arose out of a controlled buy wherein Lee sold crack cocaine to a confidential informant in January 2000. After Lee\u2019s arrest in January 2000 for distributing crack cocaine, the probation officer filed a petition in district court alleging Lee violated the terms of his supervised release. At the time of the offense, Lee was serving a three-year term of supervised release that resulted from his conviction for conspiracy to possess with intent to distribute and to distribute cocaine base in 1994.</p>\n<p id=\"b247-7\">Following a de novo review of the record, we find that the district court complied with all the mandates of Fed. R.Crim.P. 11 in accepting Lee\u2019s guilty plea. <em>United States v. Goins, </em>51 F.3d 400, 402 (4th Cir.1995) (providing standard). We also find no plain error in the calculation of Lee\u2019s sentence.<footnotemark>*</footnotemark> **\u00a7In particular, Lee was correctly sentenced as a career offender. He was over eighteen years old when he committed the instant felony offense, which involved a controlled substance, and he had two prior felony convictions. <em>U.S. Sentencing Guidelines Manual </em>\u00a7 4B1.1 (1998).</p>\n<p id=\"b247-13\">At the time Lee committed the present offense of possession with intent to distribute and distribution of cocaine base, he was serving a three-year term of supervised release. Lee admitted the supervised release violation and waived his right to a hearing. The district court found that Lee had committed the violation alleged by the Government, revoked his supervised release, and sentenced Lee to twenty-four months\u2019 imprisonment, to be served consecutively to the 170-month sentence for distribution of crack cocaine.</p>\n<p id=\"b247-14\">We review the district court\u2019s decision to revoke a defendant\u2019s supervised release for an abuse of discretion. <em>United States v. Copley, </em>978 F.2d 829, 831 (4th Cir.1992). The district court need only find a violation of a condition of supervised release by a preponderance of the evidence. 18 U.S.C. \u00a7 3583(e)(3) (1994). Here, Lee admitted to the violation alleged in the petition to revoke his supervised release. Further, because Lee\u2019s underlying conviction was for a Class C felony, the statutory maximum sentence upon revocation of his supervised release was two years incarceration. <em>Id. </em>The district court determined, pursuant to USSG \u00a7 7B1.4 (1998), that the guideline range for the supervised release violation was 33 to 41 months. However, pursuant to USSG \u00a7 7B1.4(b)(l), the district court was required to substitute the statutory maximum sentence for the applicable sentencing range. Accordingly, the district court did not abuse its discretion in <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"224\">*224</page-number>revoking Lee\u2019s supervised release and sentencing him to twenty-four months\u2019 imprisonment.</p>\n<p id=\"b248-4\">In accordance with the requirements of <em>Anders, </em>we have reviewed the record for potential error and have found none. Therefore, we affirm Lee\u2019s conviction and sentence. This court requires that counsel inform his client, in writing, of his right to petition the Supreme Court of the United States for further review. If the client requests that a petition be filed, but counsel believes that such a petition would be frivolous, then counsel may move this court for leave to withdraw from representation. Counsel\u2019s motion must state that a copy thereof was served on the client.</p>\n<p id=\"b248-5\">We dispense with oral argument because the facts and legal contentions are adequately presented in the materials before the court and argument would not aid the decisional process.</p>\n<p id=\"b248-6\">\n<em>AFFIRMED.</em>\n</p>\n<footnote label=\"*\">\n<p id=\"b247-8\"> We have considered the effect of <em>Apprendi v. New Jersey, </em>530 U.S. 466, 120 S.Ct. 2348, 147 L.Ed.2d 435 (2000), and find that, applying the statutory maximum set out in 21 U.S.C.A. \u00a7 841(b)(1)(C) (West 1999), Lee's sentence does not exceed that maximum. Accordingly, his sentence does not implicate <em>Apprendi. See United States v. Promise, </em>255 F.3d 150 (4th Cir.2001) (No. 99-4737).</p>\n</footnote>\n</opinion>\n</casebody>\n",
