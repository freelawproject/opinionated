Wilson, </em>No. 00-7525 (4th Cir. May 23, 2001), reviewed matters decided by the district court in an order issued in September 13, 2000, which the district court later abrogated in an order entered on December 22, 2000. We grant Wilson\u2019s petition for rehearing and modify our May 23, 2001, decision to rescind our conclusion that the district court properly construed Wilson\u2019s motion for reconsideration as a motion filed pursuant to 28 U.S.C.A. \u00a7 2255 (West Supp.2000). Prior to the <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"145\">*145</page-number>issuance of our decision, the district court granted in part Wilson\u2019s motion for reconsideration on the ground that his Fed.R.Civ.P. 60(b) motion should not have been construed as a motion under \u00a7 2255. The district court ultimately denied Wilson\u2019s Rule 60(b) motion on the ground that Rule 60(b) cannot be used to collaterally attack a criminal judgment. <em>See United States v. Mosavi, </em>138 F.3d 1365, 1366 (11th Cir.1998). We affirm the district court\u2019s construction of Wilson\u2019s motion and the subsequent denial of that motion on the reasoning contained in the district court\u2019s December 22, 2000, order. <em>See Wilson v. United States, </em>No. 7:96-CR-34-BR1 (E.D.N.C. Dec. 22, 2000).</p>\n<p id=\"b169-5\">\n<em>AFFIRMED.</em>\n</p>\n</opinion>\n</casebody>\n",
