Morrison, </em>477 U.S. 365, 381, 106 S.Ct. 2574, 91 L.Ed.2d 305 (1986).</p>\n<p id=\"b637-5\">I. Performance of Counsel</p>\n<p id=\"b637-6\">A. <em>Winston\u2019s belief that he owned the 109th Place properties</em></p>\n<p id=\"b637-7\">Winston argues that his trial counsel should have presented evidence to corroborate his testimony that he believed that he owned the 109th Place properties at the time of the loan applications.</p>\n<p id=\"b637-8\">The 1995 letter disclosing the quitclaim deed to Union Bank is largely irrelevant. Winston does not dispute that the quitclaim deed was not disclosed on his Union Bank loan application. The fact that it was later disclosed in a letter does not support his contention that the loan would have been approved even with this disclosure. Also, the relevant inquiry is not whether the loan would have been approved but what Winston <em>believed </em>about the effect the quitclaim deed would have on his ability to get a loan.</p>\n<p id=\"b637-9\">Testimony and income tax returns from Ingrid Winston and Sean Roy would likewise have been of marginal value because they would go primarily to what they believed, not to what Winston believed.</p>\n<p id=\"b637-10\">B. <em>Winston\u2019s Motive</em></p>\n<p id=\"b637-11\">Winston next contends that his trial counsel should have presented evidence of his financial security and good credit history to show that he did not have a motive to make intentional false statements to lenders. But because the suggested evidence would have done nothing to discount the obvious motive for Winston\u2019s false statements \u2014 that he had been rejected in two previous attempts to secure funding for his construction project \u2014 it would have done little to support his claim of innocence.</p>\n<p id=\"b637-12\">C. <em>Testimony re: John Murrell</em></p>\n<p id=\"b637-13\">Winston\u2019s third argument is that his trial counsel should have presented (1) testimony from John Murrell to impeach Special Agent Owen\u2019s testimony that she had attempted to contact every John Murrell in California and (2) a handwriting expert to compare Winston\u2019s handwriting to that on the rental agreement.</p>\n<p id=\"b637-14\">But Murrell\u2019s testimony that he had not been contacted by Agent Owen would do nothing to corroborate the existence of an actual rental agreement between Winston and Murrell. Winston\u2019s contention that trial counsel should have hired a handwriting expert, without any evidence that the expert would testify that the handwriting on the application did not match Winston\u2019s, is entirely without merit, particularly because proof that the writing was not Winston\u2019s would not prove the existence of a renter named John Murrell.</p>\n<p id=\"b637-15\">D. <em>Reasons for Denial of Bank of America Loans</em></p>\n<p id=\"b637-16\">Fourth, Winston argues that his trial counsel should have presented testimony of Quia Zinger that Winston\u2019s Bank of America loan application was rejected because he failed to agree to certain conditions and not because of his financial status. Winston has provided no declaration or other evidence to support his assertion that Zinger would have provided testimony to support his claim. Moreover, the reasons for Bank of America\u2019s denial of Winston\u2019s loan applications were presented in the form of correspondence from Bank of America and the testimony of James Taylor.</p>\n<p id=\"b637-17\">E. <em>Construction Contract and Rental Agreements</em></p>\n<p id=\"b637-18\">Winston next claims that his trial counsel should have interviewed witnesses and presented evidence to corroborate his tes<page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"614\">*614</page-number>timony regarding the undisclosed construction contract and the rental agreements for the 109th Place property.</p>\n<p id=\"b638-4\">Contrary to Winston\u2019s assertion, trial counsel did elicit testimony from Jeff Masters, Diedra Thomas, and Elizabeth Skendzic that corroborated Winston\u2019s testimony. Winston\u2019s claim that trial counsel\u2019s cross-examination of these witnesses would have been more effective had she interviewed them ahead of time is entirely speculative and does not establish conduct that is unreasonable.</p>\n<p id=\"b638-5\">Winston fails to present a declaration or other evidence to support his assertion that Toni Spiff would have presented testimony favorable to the defense. His claim that the FBI report from Spiff\u2019s interview \u201cappeared to corroborate Appellant\u2019s testimony that she told Mr. Winston that the bank did not consider his agreement with Jeff Masters as a liability\u201d is insufficient to show that trial counsel\u2019s failure to interview her was unreasonable.</p>\n<p id=\"b638-6\">Nor did trial counsel\u2019s failure to present testimony from Ingrid and Sean or to introduce utility records fall below the standard of reasonableness. Winston provides no evidence that Ingrid and Sean\u2019s testimony would have corroborated his claim that the move-in date on the application was correct and fails to explain how utility records would have proven that the information on the rental applications was true.</p>\n<p id=\"b638-7\">F. <em>Preparation to Testify</em></p>\n<p id=\"b638-8\">Finally, Winston contends that his counsel failed to prepare him to testify on his own behalf. In particular, he complains that his attorney did not advise him that the government had a copy of his true tax return which varied from that which he had submitted with his loan application. After conducting an evidentiary hearing on this issue, the district court concluded that (1) Winston intended to testify; (2) Winston admitted that his trial counsel did spend some time with him reviewing his testimony; and (3) trail counsel was under no obligation to tell Winston what his testimony should have been. Winston does not present evidence sufficient to show that the district court erred. Given that there appeared to be no obvious alternative that would allow Winston to present his side of the story, it does not seem at all \u201ccounter-intuitive\u201d that he would want an opportunity to testify despite the evidence against him. Trial counsel credibly testified that she did not elicit an explanation for the tax return from Winston because she feared the ramifications of eliciting testimony she believed to be perjured.</p>\n<p id=\"b638-10\">In sum, Winston\u2019s trial counsel\u2019s performance was well within the wide range of professional conduct considered to be reasonable.</p>\n<p id=\"b638-11\">II. Prejudice</p>\n<p id=\"b638-12\">Even if Winston could somehow demonstrate that his trial counsel\u2019s strategic decisions were unreasonable, he cannot show prejudice. Winston\u2019s claim rests on complaints about omitted evidence that has little probative value and/or quibbles with trial counsel\u2019s performance on cross-examination. This is insufficient to show a reasonable probability that the outcome of the proceedings would have been different.</p>\n<p id=\"b638-13\">AFFIRMED.</p>\n<footnote label=\"**\">\n<p id=\"b636-30\"> This disposition is not appropriate for publication and may not be cited to or by the courts in this circuit except as provided by Ninth Circuit Rule 36-3.</p>\n</footnote>\n</opinion>\n</casebody>\n",
