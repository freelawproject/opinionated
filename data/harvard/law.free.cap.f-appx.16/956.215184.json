R.App. P. 34(f); 10th Cir. R. 34.1(G). The case is therefore ordered submitted without oral argument.</p>\n<p id=\"b980-22\">Allen Charles Day appeals his convictions for manufacturing and distributing methamphetamine, as well as conspiracy to do the same, in violation of, respectively, 21 U.S.C. \u00a7 841(d)(2) and 21 U.S.C. \u00a7 846. We affirm.</p>\n<p id=\"b980-23\">During the investigation of a large-scale methamphetamine operation in Oklahoma City, the Federal Bureau of Investigation learned of the possible involvement of Mr. Day. Two agents interviewed Mr. Day, who at the time was incarcerated on unrelated charges in an Oklahoma county jail. Mr. Day made inculpatory statements during the interview. He later repeated the statements in testimony before the grand jury. In a pretrial motion, Mr. Day moved to exclude the statements on the ground that they were involuntary. Following a hearing, the trial court denied the motion to suppress. Mr. Day was convicted by a jury and sentenced to a lengthy prison term. He appeals, challenging only the denial of his motion to suppress.</p>\n<p id=\"b981-4\"><page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"957\">*957</page-number>We review the voluntariness of Mr. Days\u2019s inculpatory statements <em>de novo, </em>although the trial court\u2019s rulings regarding subsidiary factual questions are subject to review under the clearly erroneous standard. <em>United States v. Short, </em>947 F.2d 1445, 1449 (10th Cir .1991).</p>\n<p id=\"b981-5\">A defendant\u2019s due process rights under the Fourteenth and Fifth Amendments are violated if his conviction rests upon an involuntary confession. <em>Jackson v. Denno, </em>378 U.S. 368, 376, 84 S.Ct. 1774, 12 L.Ed.2d 908 (1964). <em>\u201cA </em>defendant\u2019s confession is involuntary if the government\u2019s conduct causes the defendant\u2019s will to be overborne and his capacity for self-determination critically impaired.\u201d <em>United States v. McCullah, </em>76 F.3d 1087, 1101 (10th Cir.1996) (quotation omitted). \u201cIn determining whether the defendant\u2019s will was overborne in a particular case, the court examines the totality of all the surrounding circumstances-both the characteristics of the accused and the details of the interrogation.\u201d <em>Id.</em></p>\n<p id=\"b981-6\">Relevant factors to be considered include \u201cthe age, intelligence, and education of the suspect; the length of the detention and questioning; the use or threat of physical punishment; whether <em>Miranda </em>safeguards were administered; the accused\u2019s physical and mental characteristics; and the location of the interrogation.\u201d <em>United States v. Perdue, </em>8 F.3d 1455, 1466 (10th Cir.1993). In addition, the court must \u201cconsider the conduct of the police officers.\u201d <em>Id.</em></p>\n<p id=\"b981-7\">Our independent review of the record establishes that Mr. Day\u2019s statements were voluntarily given. He was advised of his constitutional rights before he spoke to the FBI and was re-advised of those same rights before his grand jury testimony; he signed separate written statements waiving his rights prior to each event. The interview with FBI agents took place not in his jail cell but in the sheriffs office. The door to the sheriffs office was open, the thirty-three year old Mr. Day was not handcuffed during the hour and a half interview, and the agents were not visibly armed. Mr. Day does not claim that he was physically coerced or otherwise threatened in any manner by the agents.</p>\n<p id=\"b981-9\">The most Mr. Day alleges is that the FBI agents made an implied promise of immunity to him, one that amounted to an unlawful \u201cpsychological ploy\u201d given his limited educational background. Appellant Br. at 6. He was told, he claims, that his cooperation may dissuade prosecutors from charging him with any crimes. He argues that this \u201cgave him false hope that if he talked, he would not be prosecuted.\u201d <em>Id. </em>at 5. This may be so, but we cannot agree that the agents\u2019 routine comments violated the constitution.</p>\n<p id=\"b981-10\">According to testimony provided at the suppression hearing, the agents told Mr. Day, truthfully, that the contents of his interview would be provided to the prosecuting attorney\u2019s office, and that, equally truthfully, any decision to charge him with crimes resulting from his participation in the drug ring rested exclusively with the prosecutors assigned to the case. The agents further told him that, as a result of the information he provided, it was possible that he would not be charged with any crimes. This too is true. But, in the absence of some indication of coercion, neither it nor any other statement made by the agents runs afoul of the Fifth Amendment. <em>See United States v. Nguyen, </em>155 F.3d 1219, 1223 (10th Cir.1998) (relying on agent\u2019s testimony that he made no offers of leniency and holding that \u201ca statement to inform the prosecutor of a defendant\u2019s cooperation without any other indications of coercion does not constitute a promise of leniency\u201d).</p>\n<p id=\"b982-3\"><page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"958\">*958</page-number>The judgment of the United States District Court for the Western District of Oklahoma is AFFIRMED.</p>\n<footnote label=\"*\">\n<p id=\"b980-16\"> This order and judgment is not binding precedent, except under the doctrines of law of the case, res judicata, and collateral estoppel. The court generally disfavors the citation of orders and judgments; nevertheless, an order and judgment may be cited under the terms and conditions of 10th Cir. R. 36.3.</p>\n</footnote>\n</opinion>\n</casebody>\n",
