On March 18, 1997, the district court sentenced him to 264 months in prison. Goodwyn did not appeal; he has, however, previously filed two unsuccessful 28 U.S.C.A. \u00a7 2255 (West Supp.2000) motions. Goodwyn now seeks to appeal his conviction. We lack jurisdiction to consider the merits of the appeal because it is untimely. Criminal defendants have ten days from the entry of the judgment or order at issue to file a notice of appeal. Fed.R.App.P. 4(b). The appeal periods established by Rule 4 are <em>mandatory </em>and jurisdictional. <em>Browder v. Director, Dep\u2019t of Corrections, </em>434 U.S. 257, 264, 98 S.Ct. 556, 54 L.Ed.2d 521 (1978). Goodwyn filed his notice of appeal on March 15, 2001, nearly four years outside the appeal period. Goodwyn\u2019s untimely appeal deprives this court of jurisdiction to consider its merits. We therefore dismiss the appeal. We dispense with oral argument because the facts and legal contentions are adequately presented in the materials before the court and argument would not aid the decisional process.</p>\n<p id=\"b113-24\">\n<em>DISMISSED.</em>\n</p>\n</opinion>\n</casebody>\n",
