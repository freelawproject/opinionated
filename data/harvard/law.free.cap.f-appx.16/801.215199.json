(\u201cFramco\u201d) by Monticello Insurance Company (\u201cMonticello\u201d). Monticello alleges the district court erred by allowing Framco to admit evidence that James Grosser, doing business as Framco Construction Corp, was the insured party, not Framco Inc. Monticello also alleges the district court erred by finding it waived its right to rescind the insurance agreement and was guilty of laches. We find the district court properly looked at extrinsic evidence to determine the intent of the parties.<footnotemark>1</footnotemark> We also find that the district court\u2019s findings regarding waiver, laches and estoppel, are fully supported by the evidence.</p>\n<p id=\"b826-4\">AFFIRMED.</p>\n<footnote label=\"*\">\n<p id=\"b825-12\"> This disposition is not appropriate for publication and may not be cited to or by the courts of this circuit except as may be provided by 9th Cir.
