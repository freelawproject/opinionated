We deny a certificate of appealability and dismiss the appeal.</p>\n<p id=\"b291-24\">The appeal irom the July 2,1999, order was not timely filed. Parties are accorded sixty days after entry of the district court\u2019s final judgment or order to note an appeal, <em>see </em>Fed. R.App. P. 4(a)(1), unless the district court extends the appeal period under Fed. R.App. P. 4(a)(5) or reopens the appeal period under Fed. R.App. P. 4(a)(6). This appeal period is \u201cmandatory and jurisdictional.\u201d <em>Browder v. Director, Dep\u2019t of Corrections, </em>434 U.S. 257, 264, 98 S.Ct. 556, 54 L.Ed.2d 521 (1978) (quoting <em>United States v. Robinson, </em>361 U.S. 220, 229, 80 S.Ct. 282, 4 L.Ed.2d 259 (1960)).</p>\n<p id=\"b291-25\">The district court\u2019s order was entered on the docket on July 2, 1999. Zebrowski\u2019s notice of appeal was filed on May 16, 2001. Because Zebrowski failed to file a timely notice of appeal or to obtain an extension or reopening of the appeal period, we deny a certificate of appealability and dismiss the appeal.</p>\n<p id=\"b292-3\"><page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"268\">*268</page-number>Insofar as ZebrowsH appeals the district court order denying his motion for leave to amend the \u00a7 2255 motion, we have reviewed the record and the district court\u2019s order and find no reversible error. Accordingly, we deny a certificate of appealability and dismiss the appeal on the reasoning of the district court. <em>See United States v. Zebrowski </em>Nos. CR-96-41; CA-98-350-3 (E.D.Va. Mar. 14, 2001).</p>\n<p id=\"b292-4\">We dispense with oral argument because the facts and legal contentions are adequately presented in the materials before the court and argument would not aid the decisional process.</p>\n<p id=\"b292-5\">\n<em>DISMISSED.</em>\n</p>\n</opinion>\n</casebody>\n",
