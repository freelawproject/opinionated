We have reviewed the briefs and materials provided in the joint appendix and, for the following reasons, we affirm.</p>\n<p id=\"b106-11\">On appeal, Coleman argues the district court failed to adequately consider all of the factors relevant to the determination of whether or not Coleman\u2019s federal sentences should be served consecutively to, or concurrently with, his undischarged state sentences. In particular, Coleman argues the district court failed to explicitly consider 18 U.S.C.A. \u00a7\u00a7 3553(a)(2), (5) (West 2000) in reaching its decision. <em>See </em>\u00a7 5G1.3 n. 3 (incorporating \u00a7 3553(a) by reference). However, as a preliminary matter, district courts are not obliged to explicitly consider the factors of \u00a7 3553(a) in applying \u00a7 5G1.3(c). <em>See United States v. Velasquez, </em>136 F.3d 921, 924 (2d Cir. 1998); <em>cf. United States v. Legree, </em>205 F.3d 724, 728-29 (4th Cir.2000) (holding that when considering a motion for sentence reduction a district court need not ritualistically discuss factors enumerated in 18 U.S.C.A. \u00a7 3553(a)); <em>United States v. Johnson, </em>138 F.3d 115, 119 (4th Cir.1998) (holding that in non-departure cases there is a presumption, absent a \u201ccontrary indication,\u201d that a district court considered the factors enumerated in 18 U.S.C.A. \u00a7 3553(a)). Moreover, our review of the sentencing hearing transcript indicates that the district court adequately considered the factors in \u00a7 3553(a)(2) in reaching its decision. Finally, we note that \u00a7 5G1.3(e) is a qualifying policy statement for the purposes of \u00a7 3553(a)(5), and that the district court explicitly considered this statement in deciding to impose a consecutive sentence.</p>\n<p id=\"b106-13\">Accordingly, we affirm Coleman\u2019s conviction and sentence. We dispense with oral argument because the facts and legal contentions are adequately presented in the materials before the court and argument would not aid the decisional process.</p>\n<p id=\"b106-14\">\n<em>AFFIRMED.</em>\n</p>\n</opinion>\n</casebody>\n",
