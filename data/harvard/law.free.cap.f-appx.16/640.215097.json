Wolfe timely filed a notice of appeal, and we have jurisdiction pursuant to 28 U.S.C. \u00a7 1291.</p>\n<p id=\"b666-3\">\n<page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"642\">*642</page-number>\n<em>I. Variance From or Constructive Amendment of the Indictment</em>\n</p>\n<p id=\"b666-4\">Wolfe was not denied his Fifth Amendment right to indictment by grand jury when the government introduced evidence that varied from the facts of his indictment. Specifically, the government introduced evidence of the November 1998 felony charge against Wolfe even though only the two December 1998 felony charges were listed in the federal indictment. Facts that vary from the allegations of an indictment are classified as either substantial \u201camendments\u201d of or less substantial \u201cvariances\u201d from an indictment. Amendments, whether constructive or literal, are per se unconstitutional. <em>E.g., United States v. Pisello, </em>877 F.2d 762, 765 (9th Cir.1989). Variances, on the other hand, require reversal only if the defendant can prove that he or she suffered prejudice because of the error. <em>Id.</em></p>\n<p id=\"b666-5\">Amendments occur when a \u201ccomplex of facts distinctly different from those set forth in the charging instrument\u201d are introduced. <em>United States v. Von Stoll, </em>726 F.2d 584, 586 (9th Cir.1984). \u201cThe line essentially is between the situation in which different evidence supports the charged crime and that in which the evidence supports a crime other than that charged.\u201d <em>Pisello, </em>877 F.2d at 765.</p>\n<p id=\"b666-6\">The government\u2019s evidence did not vary so substantially from the indictment as to suggest a different crime and thus did not constitute an amendment. Although Wolfe\u2019s crimes were premised on the existence of a preexisting felony charge against him, the nature of neither crime turned on the precise predicate felony charged.</p>\n<p id=\"b666-7\">At most, then, the government\u2019s proof amounted to a variance from the indictment. It is grounds for reversal only if it affects the substantial rights of the defendant, <em>id, </em>in other words, if the defendant suffers prejudice. <em>United States v. McCormick, </em>72 F.3d 1404, 1408 (9th Cir. 1995). Wolfe has not shown that he suffered any prejudice as a result of the variance. As to Count 1, Wolfe suffered no prejudice because, consistent with the terms of the indictment, the jury was instructed that it had to find that Wolfe \u201cwas under an information for Residential Burglary and First Degree Theft.\u201d This referred to the December 1998 charges.</p>\n<p id=\"b666-9\">Nor did Wolfe suffer any prejudice with respect to Count 2. Even though the government introduced evidence of three felonies that Wolfe had been charged with that made Wolfe\u2019s statement to the gun dealer false, the government\u2019s burden was to show that Wolfe committed a single lie, and thus a single violation of \u00a7 922(a)(6). Even though one of the three felonies was not listed in the indictment, the effect that this variance may have had on the jury is no greater than the effect of the variances in cases in which this Court has found a lack of prejudice. <em>E.g., McCormick, </em>72 F.3d at 1408; <em>Pisello, </em>877 F.2d at 765-66; <em>Von Stoll, </em>726 F.2d at 587. Based on these cases, we hold that the variance was not prejudicial.</p>\n<p id=\"b666-10\">Nor was it a fatal variance for the government to introduce at trial <em>both </em>the state and federal forms that Wolfe had filled out, because the indictment did not specify which particular form constituted the \u201cfalse or fictitious oral or written statement.\u201d</p>\n<p id=\"b666-11\">We hold that the evidence the government adduced at trial did not violate Wolfe\u2019s rights under the Grand Jury clause.</p>\n<p id=\"b666-12\">\n<em>II. Jury Instructions and the Defense of Mistake</em>\n</p>\n<p id=\"b666-13\">The court instructed the jury, with respect to Count 2, that it had to find that Wolfe \u201cknew that the statement was false.\u201d Standing alone, this instruction, <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"643\">*643</page-number>number seven, adequately and unambiguously covered Wolfe\u2019s theory of mistake. However, \u201c[a] single instruction is not viewed in isolation, but in the context of the overall charge.\u201d <em>United States v. Harrison, </em>34 F.3d 886, 889 (9th Cir.1994). \u201cOur inquiry is whether the jury instructions as a whole are misleading or inadequate to guide the jury\u2019s deliberations.\u201d <em>United States v. Holmes, </em>229 F.3d 782, 786 (9th Cir.2000).</p>\n<p id=\"b667-5\">Unfortunately, instruction nine is somewhat confusing. It provides:</p>\n<blockquote id=\"b667-6\">An act is done \u201cknowingly\u201d if the Defendant is aware of the act and does not act through ignorance, mistake, or accident. The Government is not required to prove that the Defendant knew that his acts or omissions were unlawful. You may consider evidence of the Defendant\u2019s words, acts, or omissions, along with all the other evidence, in deciding whether the Defendant acted knowingly.</blockquote>\n<p id=\"AAT\">The main problem with this instruction is its second sentence, which provides that the \u201cGovernment is not required to prove that the Defendant knew that his acts or omissions were unlawful.\u201d This is the sentence that Wolfe tried to have removed. To the trained legal eye, this sentence conveys an uneontroversial legal maxim: ignorance of the law is no defense. <em>United States v. Cain, </em>130 F.3d 381, 384 (9th Cir.1997) (calling a similar instruction the \u201ctypical ignorance-of-the-law instruction\u201d).</p>\n<p id=\"b667-7\">If the law is accurately stated, we review the district court\u2019s choice of instructions only for an abuse of discretion, giving the trial court substantial latitude in the way it crafts instructions. <em>United States v. Reed, </em>147 F.3d 1178, 1180 (9th Cir.1998). Here the court correctly conveyed the idea that the defendant had to know he had prior felonies on his record and lied about it, but that he didn\u2019t have to know that his lies or omissions were themselves a crime. Although instruction nine is somewhat confusing, because we are required to give deference to the district court\u2019s construction of the instructions, and because the instructions were not incorrect as a matter of law, we have no cause to reverse.</p>\n<p id=\"b667-9\">\n<em>III. Multiplicity</em>\n</p>\n<p id=\"b667-10\">\u201cThe test for multiplicity is whether each count \u2018requires proof of an additional fact which the other does not.\u2019 \u201d <em>United States v.. Garlick, </em>240 F.3d 789, 794 (9th Cir.2001) (quoting <em>Blockburger v. United States, </em>284 U.S. 299, 304, 52 S.Ct. 180, 76 L.Ed. 306 (1932)).</p>\n<p id=\"b667-11\">A defendant may be indicted or convicted under both 18 U.S.C. \u00a7 922(n) and \u00a7 922(a)(6) under the <em>Blockburger </em>test. The violation of the statute charged in Count 1 requires the defendant to have been under indictment f&lt;5r a crime punishable by more than a year in prison, a fact that the statute charged in Count 2 does not require. Count 2 requires a false or fictitious oral or written statement, a fact not required under Count 1.</p>\n<p id=\"b667-12\">Wolfe argues that his conviction suffered from multiplicity because the <em>proof </em>of each count depended on facts used to prove the other. This argument fails. <em>\u201cBlockburger </em>does not direct us to compare the evidence necessary to convict the defendants of both offenses; rather, it directs us to engage in statutory construction of the two provisions under which the defendants are convicted.\u201d <em>United States v. Otis, </em>127 F.3d 829, 833 (9th Cir.1997). \u201c \u2018Substantial overlap in the proof does not establish double jeopardy.\u201d <em>Id. </em>(alterations omitted) (quoting <em>United States v.. Cuevas, </em>847 F.2d 1417, 1429 (9th Cir. 1988)). There is no multiplicity problem here because one need not be under indictment for more than a year to lie to a registered firearms dealer, and one need not make a false statement to receive a firearm.</p>\n<p id=\"b668-3\"><page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"644\">*644</page-number>Based on the foregoing, we affirm the district court\u2019s judgment of conviction. AFFIRMED.</p>\n<footnote label=\"*\">\n<p id=\"b665-14\"> This disposition is not appropriate for publication and may not be cited to or by the courts of this circuit except as may be provided by 9th Cir.
