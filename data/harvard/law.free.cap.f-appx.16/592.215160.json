Shadur, Senior United States District Judge for the Northern District of Illinois, sitting by designation.</p>\n</footnote>\n<opinion data-order=\"7\" data-type=\"opinion\" id=\"x999-2\" type=\"majority\">\n<p id=\"b617-6\">MEMORANDUM <footnotemark>**</footnotemark></p>\n<p id=\"b617-7\">In a February 2, 2000 Memorandum (No. 98-10452) we affirmed in part the sentence of Stephen Michael Blair (\u201cBlair\u201d) on 11 counts of transporting child pornography in violation of 18 U.S.C. \u00a7 2252(a)(5)(B) and one count of possessing child pornography in violation of 18 U.S.C. \u00a7 2252(a)(4)(B), but we reversed and remanded the district court\u2019s application of the distribution enhancement under U.S.S.G. (\u201cGuideline\u201d) \u00a7 2G2.2(b)(2) in light of our decision in <em>United States v. Laney, </em>189 F.3d 954 (9th Cir.1999). Blair now appeals the district court\u2019s post-remand ruling that the 5 level increase under Guideline \u00a7 2G2.2(b)(2) applies. Blair also argues that the district court erred in applying a preponderance of the evidence standard at the resentencing hearing. We affirm.</p>\n<p id=\"b617-8\">We review a district court\u2019s interpretation of the Guidelines de novo and review its factual findings for clear error <em>(United States v. Ellis, </em>241 F.3d 1096, 1099 (9th Cir .2001)).</p>\n<p id=\"b617-9\">After Blair was resentenced, Guideline \u00a7 2G2.2(b)(2) was amended effective November 1, 2000. There is no dispute that the amendment was clarifying rather than substantive (the Sentencing Commission said just that), so that it is given retroactive application on direct appeal <em>(United States v. Cruz-Mendoza, </em>147 F.3d 1069, 1073 (9th Cir.1998)).</p>\n<p id=\"b617-12\">Given the district court\u2019s finding that Blair distributed child pornographic pictures with the expectation of receiving other child pornographic pictures in return, under the amendment Blair is subject to the 5 level increase per Guideline \u00a7 2G2.2(b)(2)(B) for \u201cDistribution for the receipt, or expectation of receipt, of a thing of value, but not for pecuniary gain.\u201d On that score the district court\u2019s finding that Blair had an expectation of barter (a subject covered directly by the Guideline) is more than adequately supported by the record. As that record reveals, the child pornographic images Blair sent to participants in an on-line chat room catering to persons interested in preteen child pornography were accompanied by such messages as \u201ckeep it going\u201d and \u201csend more.\u201d We therefore affirm the application of the 5 level increase under Guideline \u00a7 2G2.2(b)(2).</p>\n<p id=\"b617-13\">As to Blair\u2019s objection to the use of a preponderance of the evidence standard, Blair did not object to the use of that standard before the district court. It is therefore reviewed for plain error <em>(United States v. Garcia-Guizar, </em>227 F.3d 1125, 1129 (9th Cir.2000)). Because the application of Guideline \u00a7 2G2.2(b)(2) would not have an extremely disproportionate effect on Blair\u2019s sentence, the district court did not commit plain error in applying a preponderance of the evidence standard (see <em>United States v. Valensia, </em>222 F.3d 1173 (9th Cir.2000)). Indeed, the district court\u2019s determination would be affirmed under any standard of review.</p>\n<p id=\"b617-14\">AFFIRMED.</p>\n<footnote label=\"**\">\n<p id=\"b617-16\"> This disposition is not appropriate for publication and may not be cited to or by the courts of this circuit except as may be provided by Ninth Circuit Rule 36-3.</p>\n</footnote>\n</opinion>\n</casebody>\n",
