Reed\u2019s indictment failed to state a specific drug quantity. However, Reed signed a plea agreement in which he stipulated to involvement with \u201cnot less than 50 grams\u201d of cocaine base. Reed also stipulated to receiving a prior conviction that would enhance his sentence under 21 U.S.C. \u00a7 851 (1994), and to a minimum incarceration <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"189\">*189</page-number>period of twenty years. Reed reaffirmed these stipulations at his plea hearing.</p>\n<p id=\"b213-5\">Reed was sentenced to twenty years incarceration under 21 U.S.C.A. \u00a7 841(b)(1)(A) (West 1999), and argues that under <em>Apprendi v. New Jersey, </em>530 U.S. 466, 490, 120 S.Ct. 2348, 147 L.Ed.2d 435 (2000), he should have been sentenced under 21 U.S.C.A. \u00a7 841(b)(1)(C) (West 1999) , because his indictment failed to state a drug quantity. Reed also argues the district court lacked jurisdiction to enhance his sentence under 21 U.S.C. \u00a7 851. We disagree.</p>\n<p id=\"b213-7\">Reed\u2019s sentence does not violate <em>Apprendi </em>because his twenty-year incarceration period does not exceed the statutory maximum set forth in \u00a7\u00a7 841(b)(1)(C), 846. <em>United States v. Angle, </em>254 F.3d 514, 517-18 (4th Cir.2001) (en banc); <em>United States v. Promise, </em>255 F.3d 150, 156-57 (4th Cir.2001) (en banc); <em>United States v. Kinter, </em>235 F.3d 192, 199-200 (4th Cir. 2000) , <em>cert. denied, </em>\u2014 U.S. -, 121 S.Ct. 1393, 149 L.Ed.2d 316 (2001); <em>United States v. Lewis, </em>235 F.3d 215, 219 (4th Cir.2000).</p>\n<p id=\"b213-10\">Additionally, Reed fails to establish the district court lacked jurisdiction to enhance his sentence under 21 U.S.C. \u00a7 851. Reed stipulated to liability for a drug quantity and a prior criminal offense, mandating a twenty-year incarceration period. Reed is bound by the terms of his plea agreement. <em>United States v. Williams, </em>29 F.3d 172, 174-75 (4th Cir.1994); <em>United States v. Wiggins, </em>905 F.2d 51, 53 (4th Cir.1990); <em>United States v. Foster, </em>68 F.3d 86, 89 (4th Cir.1995).</p>\n<p id=\"b213-11\">We dispense with oral argument because the facts and legal contentions are adequately presented in the materials before the court and argument would not aid in the decisional process.</p>\n<p id=\"b213-13\">\n<em>AFFIRMED.</em>\n</p>\n</opinion>\n</casebody>\n",
