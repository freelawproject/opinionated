The district court granted a certificate of appealability on two issues: (1) the trial court erred in overruling his challenge to the prosecutor\u2019s use of peremptory strikes under <em>Batson v. Kentucky, </em>476 U.S. 79, 106 S.Ct. 1712, 90 L.Ed.2d 69 (1986), and (2) he received ineffective assistance of appellate counsel when his counsel failed to challenge the sufficiency of the evidence. For the reasons discussed below, we affirm the judgment of the district court.</p>\n<p id=\"b571-17\">We agree with the district court that there is no clear and convincing evidence that the prosecutor\u2019s reasons for striking the two venirepersons at issue were pretextual. <em>See </em>28 U.S.C. \u00a7 2254(e)(1) (factual determinations made by state court are presumed to be correct, and may be rebutted only by clear and convincing evidence); <em>Shurn v. Delo, </em>177 F.3d 662, 665 (8th Cir.) (prosecutor\u2019s motive in excluding jurors is question of fact), <em>cert. denied, </em>528 U.S. 1010, 120 S.Ct. 510, 145 L.Ed.2d 395 (1999); <em>Carter v. Hopkins, </em>151 F.3d 872, 874-75 (8th Cir.) (if petitioner makes prima facie showing of purposeful discrimination in prosecutor\u2019s use of peremptory strikes, burden shifts to prosecutor to articulate race-neutral explanations for strikes, which petitioner may show was pretextual), <em>cert. denied, </em>525 U.S. 1007, 119 S.Ct. 524, 142 L.Ed.2d 435 (1998).</p>\n<p id=\"b571-18\">Aso, Green has failed to show that his appellate counsel\u2019s performance was objectively unreasonable and that there is a reasonable probability the outcome of his appeal would have been different if counsel had challenged the sufficiency of the evidence. <em>See Armstrong v. Gammon, </em>195 F.3d 441, 444 (8th Cir.1999), <em>cert. denied, </em>529 U.S. 1092, 120 S.Ct. 1731, 146 L.Ed.2d 651 (2000). Viewing the evidence in the light most favorable to the verdict, we conclude a rational jury could have found beyond a reasonable doubt that Green pos<page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"548\">*548</page-number>sessed cocaine: a detective testified that he saw Green drop a bag containing cocaine after two police officers had identified themselves to him, and that he also found cocaine on Green\u2019s person during the ensuing patdown search. <em>See State v. Chaney, </em>967 S.W.2d 47, 52(Mo.) (en banc) (standard for reviewing sufficiency of evidence), ce<em>rt. denied, </em>525 U.S. 1021, 119 S.Ct. 551, 142 L.Ed.2d 458 (1998).</p>\n<p id=\"b572-4\">Accordingly, we affirm the dismissal of the petition. We also grant counsel\u2019s motion to withdraw and deny Green\u2019s motions for judgment on the pleadings.</p>\n<footnote label=\"1\">\n<p id=\"b571-15\">. The Honorable Jean C. Hamilton, Chief Judge, United States District Court for the Eastem District of Missouri.</p>\n</footnote>\n</opinion>\n</casebody>\n",
