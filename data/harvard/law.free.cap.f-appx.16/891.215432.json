After the District Court for the District of Colorado dismissed Bishop\u2019s claims,<footnotemark>1</footnotemark> Mr. Bishop filed notice of appeal and a motion to proceed on appeal in forma pauperis (\u201cIFP\u201d). The <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"893\">*893</page-number>district court denied Mr. Bishop\u2019s IFP request based upon the \u201cthree strikes\u201d provision of 28 U.S.C. \u00a7 1915(g),<footnotemark>2</footnotemark> which states:</p>\n<blockquote id=\"A3s\">In no event shall a prisoner bring a civil action or appeal a judgment in a civil action or proceeding under this section if the prisoner has, on 8 or more prior occasions, while incarcerated or detained in any facility, brought an action or appeal in a court of the United States that was dismissed on the grounds that it is frivolous, malicious, or fails to state a claim upon which relief may be granted, unless the prisoner is under imminent danger of serious physical injury.</blockquote>\n<p id=\"b917-5\">28 U.S.C. \u00a7 1915(g). <em>(See Bishop v. Dischner, et al., </em>No. 99-B-298, slip op. at 2-3 (D.Colo. Dec. 5, 2000) (Order).) The district court determined that Mr. Bishop was subject to the \u201cthree strikes\u201d provision of \u00a7 1915(g) based upon his three prior filings of actions later dismissed as legally frivolous. <em>See id. </em>(citing <em>Bishop v. Pearsons, </em>No. 95-S-1183 (D.Colo. Aug. 7, 1995) (dismissed as legally frivolous); <em>Bishop v. Colorado Dep\u2019t of Corr., </em>No. 98-D-171 (D.Colo. July 9, 1998), <em>aff'd, </em>Nos. 98-1294, 98-1296, 1999 WL 46688 (10th Cir. Feb. 3, 1999), <em>cert. denied, </em>527 U.S. 1008, 119 S.Ct. 2346, 144 L.Ed.2d 243 (1999) (dismissed as legally frivolous); <em>Bishop v. Romer, </em>No. 98-D-1238 (D.Colo. July 9, 1998), <em>aff'd, </em>Nos. 98-1294, 98-1296, 1999 WL 46688 (10th Cir. Feb. 3, 1999), <em>cert. denied, </em>527 U.S. 1008, 119 S.Ct. 2346, 144 L.Ed.2d 243 (1999) (dismissed as legally frivolous).)<footnotemark>3</footnotemark></p>\n<p id=\"b917-9\">After receiving Mr. Bishop\u2019s notice of appeal, but not the required $105.00 appellate filing fee, this court issued an order dated October 26, 2000, instructing Mr. Bishop to \u201cshow cause in writing within twenty days of the date of this order why 1) the appeal should not be dismissed for failure to prepay the entire filing fee as required by 28 U.S.C. \u00a7 1915(g), or 2) why the provisions of the Prison Litigation Reform Act do not apply to this proceeding.\u201d<footnotemark>4</footnotemark> (See <em>Bishop v. Dischner, et al., </em>No. 99-1431, slip op. at 2-3 (10th Cir. Oct. 26, 2000).) Again, this order was based upon the \u201cthree strikes\u201d provision of \u00a7 1915(g) and Mr. Bishop\u2019s three previous federal court filings which were dismissed as legally frivolous. (See <em>id., </em>slip op. at 2.)</p>\n<p id=\"b917-10\">In response, Mr. Bishop did not contest that he has \u201con 3 or more prior occasions, while incarcerated or detained in any facility, brought an action or appeal in a court of the United States that was dismissed on the grounds that it is frivolous, malicious, or fails to state a claim on which relief may be granted.\u201d See 28 U.S.C. \u00a7 1915(g). Further, Mr. Bishop did not argue that he falls within the expressly stated exception to the \u201cthree strikes\u201d provision, ie., that he is \u201cunder imminent danger of serious physical injury.\u201d <em>Id. </em>Instead, Mr. Bishop offered three alternate arguments for why he believes he should not be bound by the \u201cthree strikes\u201d provision of \u00a7 1915(g): (1) his current claim is meritorious; (2) section 1915(g) is unconstitutional; and (3) <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"894\">*894</page-number>section 1915(g) does not apply to the appeals process. We find these arguments unconvincing.</p>\n<p id=\"b918-4\">First, the merits of Mr. Bishop\u2019s claims are irrelevant to a determination of whether the \u201cthree strikes\u201d provision bars him from proceeding on appeal in forma pauperis. The \u201cthree strikes\u201d provision is a filing prerequisite and must be applied whenever it is deemed appropriate under the express terms of the statute,<footnotemark>5</footnotemark> regardless of whether the underlying claims may be meritorious.</p>\n<p id=\"b918-5\">Second, Mr. Bishop\u2019s argument that \u00a7 1915(g) is unconstitutional because it violates the First Amendment, and the Equal Protection and Due Process Clauses of the Fourteenth Amendment, is squarely foreclosed by this court\u2019s opinion in <em>White v. Colorado, </em>157 F.3d 1226, 1232-33 (10th Cir.1998) (rejecting prisoner\u2019s equal protection and due process challenges to \u00a7 1915(g), both of which were founded upon a First Amendment claim of right of access to the courts). <em>See also Carson v. Johnson, </em>112 F.3d 818, 821 (5th Cir.1997) (noting that \u00a7 1915(g) \u201cdoes not prevent a prisoner with three strikes from filing civil actions; it merely prohibits him from enjoying [in forma pauperis] status\u201d) (rejecting right of access, due process and equal protection challenges); <em>cf. Roller v. Gunn, </em>107 F.3d 227, 231 (4th Cir.1997) (\u201cCongress is no more compelled to guarantee free access to federal courts than it is to provide unlimited access to them.\u201d) (rejecting prisoner\u2019s free access to the courts constitutional challenge to 28 U.S.C. \u00a7\u00a7 1915(b)(1), (b)(2), (b)(4)).</p>\n<p id=\"b918-7\">To the extent that Mr. Bishop challenges \u00a7 1915(g) on Seventh Amendment grounds, which we interpret as an argument that he is entitled to a jury trial on these claims, we note that a plaintiff\u2019s right to a civil jury trial exists only where there is a genuine issue of fact to be determined. <em>See Parklane Hosiery Co. v. Shore, </em>439 U.S. 322, 336, 99 S.Ct. 645, 58 L.Ed.2d 552 (1979); <em>Ex Parte Peterson, </em>253 U.S. 300, 310, 40 S.Ct. 543, 64 L.Ed. 919 (1920) (\u201cNo one is entitled in a civil case to trial by jury, unless and except so far as there are issues of fact to be determined.\u201d). The district court dismissed each of Mr. Bishop\u2019s claims as insufficient as a matter of law. Although we cannot at this juncture review the merits of Mr. Bishop\u2019s claims, we find untenable Mr. Bishop\u2019s argument that his claims may nevertheless eventually give rise to a genuine issue of material fact, such that applying the \u201cthree strikes\u201d provision of \u00a7 1915(g) would deny him a right to a jury trial in this civil case. <em>Cf. Christensen v. Ward, </em>916 F.2d 1462, 1466 (10th Cir.1990) (noting that the proper dismissal of a complaint under Federal Rule of Civil Procedure 12(b)(6) does not violate the Seventh Amendment).</p>\n<p id=\"b918-8\">Third, Mr. Bishop\u2019s argument that \u00a7 1915(g) does not apply to the appeals process is contradicted by the plain language of the statute, which states that in forma pauperis status shall not be granted to a prisoner who seeks to \u201cbring a civil action <em>or appeal a judgment in a civil action\u201d </em>after previously garnering \u201cthree strikes\u201d for frivolous filings in the federal courts.</p>\n<p id=\"b919-4\"><page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"895\">*895</page-number>For the foregoing reasons, we determined that \u00a7 1915(g) precluded us from granting Mr. Bishop\u2019s request to proceed in forma pauperis on appeal. Accordingly, on July 11, 2001, we advised Mr. Bishop of our decision and ordered him to pay the full $105.00 appellate filing fee within twenty (20) days or face dismissal of this appeal. Instead of paying the filing fee, Mr. Bishop filed a motion to reconsider our July 11, 2001, order. We have reviewed Mr. Bishop\u2019s motion and find that he has not presented us with any reason to reconsider our earlier conclusion that he is ineligible to proceed in forma pauperis on appeal. Mr. Bishop\u2019s motion to reconsider is therefore DENIED and this appeal is DISMISSED.</p>\n<footnote label=\"*\">\n<p id=\"b916-13\"> After examining appellant's brief and the appellate record, this panel has determined unanimously that oral argument would not materially assist the determination of this appeal. <em>See </em>Fed. R.App. P. 34(a)(2) and 10th Cir. R. 34.1(G). The case is therefore ordered submitted without oral argument. This Order and Judgment is not binding precedent, except under the doctrines of law of the case, res judicata, and collateral estoppel. The court generally disfavors the citation of orders and judgments; nevertheless, an order and judgment may be cited under the terms and conditions of 10th Cir. R. 36.3.</p>\n</footnote>\n<footnote label=\"1\">\n<p id=\"b916-23\">. On September 1, 2000, the district court dismissed Mr. Bishop's claims of excessive force and deliberate indifference pursuant to Federal Rule of Civil Procedure 12(b)(6). Mr. Bishop's other claims, which had been brought against several supervisory personnel at the prison, had been previously dismissed as legally frivolous under 28 U.S.C. \u00a7 1915(e)(2)(B).</p>\n</footnote>\n<footnote label=\"2\">\n<p id=\"b917-6\">. 28 U.S.C. \u00a7 1915 is the federal statute setting forth the requirements for all prisoners seeking to proceed with federal court actions in forma pauperis.</p>\n</footnote>\n<footnote label=\"3\">\n<p id=\"b917-7\">. Although these two actions were ultimately combined for purposes of appellate resolution, they count as two separate civil actions for purposes of the \u201cthree strikes\u201d provision of \u00a7 1915(g). (See <em>Bishop v. Romer, </em>Nos. 98-1294, 98-1296, 172 F.3d 62, 1999 WL 46688, at *3 (10th Cir. Feb. 3, 1999) (unpublished opinion) (\"We conclude Mr. Bishop\u2019s two appeals count as two prior occasions for the purposes of 28 U.S.C. \u00a7 1915(g).\u201d).)</p>\n</footnote>\n<footnote label=\"4\">\n<p id=\"b917-12\">. Subsequent to our order to show cause, Mr. Bishop filed with this court a second application for leave to proceed on appeal in forma pauperis. (See Prisoner's Motion and Affidavit for Leave to Proceed on Appeal Pursuant to 28 U.S.C. \u00a7 1915 and Fed. Rule App. P. 24 (filed Dec. 1, 2000).)</p>\n</footnote>\n<footnote label=\"5\">\n<p id=\"b918-6\">. Mr. Bishop could avoid the prepayment of filing fees requirement of \u00a7 1915(g) if: (1) he did not, in fact, have \"three strikes\u201d; (2) he alleged an \"imminent danger of serious physical injury,\u201d <em>see White v. Colorado, </em>157 F.3d 1226, 1231-32 (10th Cir.1998); (3) he was not appealing a civil action as defined by the Prison Litigation Reform Act of 1995, Pub. L. No. 104-134, \u00a7\u00a7 804-810, 110 Stat. 1321 (April 26, 1996), and subsequent cases; (4) he was not currently incarcerated as defined in 28 U.S.C. \u00a7 1915(h); or (5) his notice of appeal was filed before the enactment date of the PLRA, <em>see White v. Gregory, </em>87 F.3d 429, 430 (10th Cir.1996). None of these exceptions apply to this case.</p>\n</footnote>\n</opinion>\n</casebody>\n",
