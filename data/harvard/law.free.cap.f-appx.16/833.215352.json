The district court concluded that it lacked jurisdiction for several reasons and that Moore\u2019s fair-representation claim is barred by the union membership\u2019s ratification of the implementing agreement between Brotherhood and Union Pacific. The court also stated that the defendants would be entitled to summary judgment. We affirm for the following reason.</p>\n<p id=\"b858-8\">Moore has presented no evidence beyond the union agreement itself in support of his fair-representation claim or his claim to seniority rights. Likewise, he has offered no evidence that Union Pacific acted inappropriately. Therefore, his fair-representation claim fails. For the same reason, no violation of the union constitution is presented.</p>\n<p id=\"b858-12\">However, our holding does not preclude a claim that the collective bargaining agreements were unfair to Moore or suggest any decision as to whether that claim could be arbitrable under the <em>New York Dock </em>conditions,<footnotemark>1</footnotemark> or before the National Railroad Adjustment Board.<footnotemark>2</footnotemark></p>\n<p id=\"b858-13\">AFFIRMED.</p>\n<footnote label=\"**\">\n<p id=\"b858-10\"> This order and judgment is not binding precedent, except under the doctrines of law of the case, res judicata, and collateral estoppel. The court generally disfavors the citation of orders and judgments; nevertheless, an order and judgment may be cited under the terms and conditions of 10th Cir.R. 36.3.</p>\n</footnote>\n<footnote label=\"1\">\n<p id=\"b858-23\">. <em>See New York Dock Ry. v.
