Turner pled guilty to being a felon in possession of a firearm. He received an enhanced sentence as an armed career criminal under 18 U.S.C. \u00a7 924(e) (1994). The Government moved to dismiss Turner\u2019s appeal pursuant to the appeal waiver in his plea agreement. Although we deny the Government\u2019s motion to dismiss, we affirm Turner\u2019s conviction and sentence.</p>\n<p id=\"b186-21\">Turner contends that the district court lacked the authority to impose a sentence over ten years of imprisonment, in light of <em>Apprendi v. New Jersey, </em>530 U.S. 466, 120 S.Ct. 2348, 147 L.Ed.2d 435 (2000), because his prior convictions were neither charged in the indictment nor proven beyond a reasonable doubt. We find that <em>Apprendi </em>does not apply to Turner\u2019s enhanced sentence for being an armed career criminal. <em>United States v. Dorris, </em>236 F.3d 582, 587-88 (10th Cir.2000) (holding that \u00a7 924(e) sentence not affected by <em>Apprendi </em>).</p>\n<p id=\"b186-22\">Accordingly, we affirm Turner\u2019s conviction and sentence. We dispense with oral argument, because the facts and legal contentions are adequately presented in the materials before the court and argument would not aid the decisional process.</p>\n<p id=\"b186-23\">\n<em>AFFIRMED.</em>\n</p>\n</opinion>\n</casebody>\n",
