Having carefully reviewed the record, including the testimony presented at the suppression hearing, we agree with the district court that the traffic stop was lawful, given that the officer involved had reason to believe the car that appellant was driving was unregistered. We also agree that appellant was not detained for an unreasonable length of time after the stop. <em>See United States v. Peltier, </em>217 F.3d 608, 610 (8th Cir.2000) (traffic stop was lawful where vehicle had no license plate and tinted windows prevented deputy from seeing temporary registration application); <em>United States v. Allegree, </em>175 F.3d 648, 650 (8th Cir.) (officer reasonably believed, although mistakenly, that vehicle violated operating statutes and thus was entitled to stop car; because officer\u2019s suspicions were aroused during traffic stop, he was entitled to expand scope of questioning and subsequent voluntary consent to search was valid), <em>cert. denied </em>528 U.S. 958, 120 S.Ct. 388, 145 L.Ed.2d 303 (1999); <em>United States v. $404,905.00 in U.S. Currency, </em>182 F.3d 643, 647 (8th Cir.1999) (following valid traffic stop, officer may detain motorist while completing routine but time-consuming tasks, such as computerized checks of vehicle\u2019s registration, driver\u2019s license, and criminal history), <em>cert. denied, </em>528 U.S. 1161, 120 S.Ct. 1175, 145 L.Ed.2d 1083 (2000).</p>\n<p id=\"b563-5\">Accordingly, we affirm. <em>See </em>8th Cir. R. 47B.</p>\n<footnote label=\"1\">\n<p id=\"b562-8\">. The Honorable Donovan W. Frank, United States District Judge for the District of Minnesota, adopting the report and recommendation of the Honorable Arthur J.
