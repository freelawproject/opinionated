Price conditionally pleaded guilty to the charge of felon in possession of a firearm, in violation of 18 U.S.C. \u00a7\u00a7 922(g)(1) and 924(a)(2). His base offense level was based on the district court\u2019s determination that Price had two prior felony convictions of crimes of violence under U.S.S.G. \u00a7 2K2.1. The district court sentenced him to 77 months imprisonment and 3 years supervised release.</p>\n<p id=\"b567-18\">Price argues on appeal that his suppression motion should have been granted as to certain evidence \u2014 a jacket containing a handgun, a pair of gloves, and a screwdriver \u2014 that he asserts was unlawfully seized, because officers lacked probable cause to search the residence where he was arrested, no exceptions to the warrant requirement applied, and Price had standing to challenge the search as a lifelong Mend of the owner and regular visitor to the residence. Price further argues that his prior conviction for burglary of a commercial building does not constitute a crime of violence, because U.S.S.G. \u00a7 4B1.2(a)(2) limits the range of burglary offenses that constitute a crime of violence to include only burglaries of dwellings. We reject both arguments.</p>\n<p id=\"b567-19\">First, whether or not Price had standing to challenge the search, we find Price abandoned his jacket when he removed it before submitting to arrest. <em>See United States v. Liu, </em>180 F.3d 957, 960 (8th Cir.1999) (in determining whether property has been abandoned for Fourth Amendment purposes, court looks at totality of circumstances, in particular whether suspect denied ownership of property and <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"544\">*544</page-number>whether he physically relinquished property); <em>United States v. Landry, </em>154 F.3d 897, 899 (8th Cir.1998) (whether abandonment has occurred is determined on basis of objective facts available to investigating officers, not on basis of owner\u2019s subjective intent), <em>cert. denied, </em>525 U.S. 1086, 119 S.Ct. 836, 142 L.Ed.2d 692 (1999); <em>United States v. Tugwell, </em>125 F.3d 600, 602 (8th Cir.1997) (warrantless search of abandoned property is constitutional because any expectation of privacy in item searched is forfeited upon its abandonment), ce<em>rt. denied, </em>522 U.S. 1061, 118 S.Ct. 721, 139 L.Ed.2d 661 (1998). Alternatively, because probable cause existed for Price\u2019s arrest, the search of his jacket was lawful as a search incident to arrest. <em>See United States v. Oakley, </em>153 F.3d 696, 698 (8th Cir.1998); <em>see also Curd v. City Court of Judsonia, Ark., </em>141 F.3d 839, 842 (8th Cir.1998) (\u201cWarrantless searches incident to a custodial arrest are \u2018justified by the reasonableness of searching for weapons, instruments of escape, and evidence of crime when a person is taken into official custody and lawfully detained.\u2019 \u201d (quoting <em>United States v. Edwards, </em>415 U.S. 800, 802-03, 94 S.Ct. 1234, 39 L.Ed.2d 771 (1974))).</p>\n<p id=\"b568-4\">Second, the district court correctly determined that Price\u2019s commercial-burglary conviction constituted a crime of violence, <em>see United States v. Hascall, </em>76 F.3d 902, 904-06 (8th Cir.) (finding second-degree burglary of commercial building involves conduct that presents serious risk of physical injury to another under U.S.S.G. \u00a7 4B1.2, and thus is crime of violence), <em>cert. denied, </em>519 U.S. 948, 117 S.Ct. 358, 136 L.Ed.2d 250 (1996); <em>see also United States v. Stevens, </em>149 F.3d 747, 749 (8th Cir.) (holding third-degree burglary of commercial building has potential for episodic violence and is a qualifying offense under U.S.S.G. \u00a7 4B1.1), <em>cert. denied, </em>525 U.S. 1009, 119 S.Ct. 527, 142 L.Ed.2d 437 (1998), and therefore correctly calculated the base offense level under the Guidelines. Accordingly, we affirm the judgment of the district court.</p>\n<footnote label=\"1\">\n<p id=\"b567-15\">. The Honorable Scott O.
