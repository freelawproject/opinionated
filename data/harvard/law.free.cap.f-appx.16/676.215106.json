Josey seeks to vacate his state court conviction on grounds of ineffective assistance of counsel because trial counsel failed to object to Josey\u2019s being tried while wearing prison clothes. We have jurisdiction pursuant to 28 U.S.C. \u00a7\u00a7 2253 and 1291, and we affirm.</p>\n<p id=\"b701-5\">We review de novo the district court\u2019s decision to deny a habeas petition under 28 U.S.C. \u00a7 2254. <em>Patterson v. Gomez, </em>223 F.3d 959, 962 (9th Cir.2000); <em>Houston v. Roe, </em>177 F.3d 901, 905 (9th Cir.1999).</p>\n<p id=\"b701-6\">Under the Antiterrorism and Effective Death Penalty Act of 1996, we may grant a habeas writ only if the state court decision is \u201ccontrary to, or involved an unreasonable application of, clearly established Federal law, as determined by the Supreme Court of the United States.\u201d 28 U.S.C. \u00a7 2254(d)(1). The \u201cSupreme Court need not have addressed a factually identical case[;] \u00a7 2254(d) only requires that the Supreme Court clearly determine the law.\u201d <em>Houston, </em>177 F.3d at 906. \u201c[0]ur independent review of the legal question ... [must] leave[] us with a \u2018firm conviction\u2019 that one answer, the one rejected by the [state] court, was correct and the other, the application of the federal law that the court adopted, was erroneous \u2014 in other words that clear error occurred.\u201d <em>Van Tran v. Lindsey, </em>212 F.3d 1143, 1153-54 (9th Cir.), <em>cert. denied, </em>531 U.S. 944, 121 S.Ct. 340, 148 L.Ed.2d 274 (2000).</p>\n<p id=\"b701-7\">The applicable law in Josey\u2019s case is <em>Strickland v. Washington, </em>466 U.S. 668, 104 S.Ct. 2052, 80 L.Ed.2d 674 (1984), which is \u201cclearly established Federal law\u201d under the AEDPA. <em>See Van Tran, </em>212 F.3d at 1156; <em>Delgado, </em>223 F.3d at 980.</p>\n<p id=\"b701-8\">To prevail on a claim of ineffective assistance of counsel, Josey must show 1) that his trial counsel\u2019s performance fell outside a wide range of reasonableness and 2) that he was prejudiced by that performance. <em>Weighall v. Middle, </em>215 F.3d 1058, 1062 (9th Cir.2000) (citing <em>Strickland, </em>466 U.S. at 691, 694, 104 S.Ct. 2052). \u201cPrejudice occurs where \u2018there is a reasonable probability that, but for counsel\u2019s unprofessional errors, the result of the proceeding would have been different. ... A reasonable probability is a probability sufficient to undermine confidence in the outcome.\u2019 \u201d <em>Id. Strickland </em>challenges are to be analyzed under the \u201cunreasonable application\u201d prong of section 2254(d). <em>Weighall, </em>215 F.3d at 1062.</p>\n<p id=\"b701-10\">We reject Josey\u2019s contention. First, although Josey had a due process right not to be <em>compelled </em>to stand trial in jail clothes, <em>Estelle v. Williams, </em>425 U.S. 501, 96 S.Ct. 1691, 48 L.Ed.2d 126 (1976), the record clearly shows that he was not compelled at all. To the contrary, defense counsel explicitly declined the trial judge\u2019s express invitation regarding a change of clothes. Counsel requested that Josey be unshackled, but specifically stated that no change of clothes was necessary. This gives rise to an inference of a reasoned tactical decision on the part of counsel. Even if we were to find that counsel\u2019s judgment in this respect was professionally unreasonable, no prejudice has been shown. Regardless of what wearing jail clothes might imply about Josey, Josey expressly admitted on the stand that he had two prior bank robbery convictions. In any ease, the evidence of guilt was overwhelming \u2014 not only were the drugs found on Josey\u2019s person, but upon arrest he made a statement admitting his use of the substance.</p>\n<p id=\"b701-11\">Upon the record as a whole, we are compelled to conclude that the state court\u2019s rejection of Josey\u2019s ineffective assistance claim was not clearly erroneous. <em>See Van Tran, </em>212 F.3d at 1153. The district court did not err in its determination that the state court\u2019s decision was not an unreasonable application of clearly es<page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"678\">*678</page-number>tablished Federal law. 28 U.S.C. \u00a7 2254(d); <em>Weighall, </em>215 F.3d at 1062.<footnotemark>1</footnotemark></p>\n<p id=\"b702-4\">AFFIRMED.</p>\n<footnote label=\"*\">\n<p id=\"b700-19\"> This disposition is not appropriate for publication and may not be cited to or by the courts of this circuit except as may be provided by 9th Cir.

Josey's additional request that the district court, at the very least, be directed to conduct an evidentiary hearing is without merit because he failed to develop the factual basis of his claim in the state court proceedings. 28 U.S.C. \u00a7 2254(e)(2); <em>Bragg v. Galaza, </em>242 F.3d 1082, 1089-90 (9th Cir.2001).</p>\n</footnote>\n</opinion>\n</casebody>\n",
