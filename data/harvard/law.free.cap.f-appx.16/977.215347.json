R. doc. 1 (complaint). Mr. McCone was convicted in state court of four counts of making terroristic threats in violation of Wyo. Stat. \u00a7 6-2-505. <em>McCone v. State, </em>866 P.2d 740, 743 (Wyo.1993). His conviction was affirmed on direct appeal. <em>Id. </em>at 756. Mr. McCone then filed three post-conviction motions in state court, and two petitions for habeas corpus relief in federal district court, all of which were unsuccessful. <em>McCone v. Uphoff, </em>83 F.3d 432, 1996 WL 194850 (10th Cir. April 23, 1996) (unpublished) (hereinafter <em>McCone I); McCone v. Wyo. Att\u2019y. Gen., </em>161 F.3d 18, 1998 WL 670210 (10th Cir. Sept.22, 1998) (unpublished) (hereinafter <em>McCone II). </em>We affirmed the dismissal of the first petition, <em>McCone I, </em>1996 WL 194850, at *1, and dismissed the second. <em>McCone II, </em>1998 WL 670210, at *1. Mr. McCone then filed the instant \u00a7 1983 action in federal district court. R. doc. 1.</p>\n<p id=\"b1002-16\">The district court concluded that judgment in Mr. McCone\u2019s favor would imply the invalidity of his conviction. R. doc. 13, at 3. The district court therefore dismissed the complaint because Mr. <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"979\">*979</page-number>McCone did not show \u201cthat his conviction or sentence has either been reversed on direct appeal, expunged by executive order or declared invalid by a state tribunal, or called into question by a federal court\u2019s issuance of a writ of habeas corpus as required by <em>Heck v. Humphrey, </em>512 U.S. 477, 486-87, 114 S.Ct. 2364, 129 L.Ed.2d 383 (1994).\u201d R. doc. 13, at 2. We review the district court\u2019s dismissal of Mr. McCone\u2019s complaint de novo. <em>Sutton v. Utah State Sch. for the Deaf &amp; Blind, </em>173 F.3d 1226, 1236 (10th Cir.1999). Having done so, we find no error in the district court\u2019s dismissal of the complaint, 28 U.S.C. \u00a7 1915(e)(2)(B)(ii), and further find that Mr. McCone\u2019s appeal is frivolous. \u00a7 1915(e)(2)(B)(i). Accordingly, we DENY leave to proceed in forma pauperis and DISMISS this appeal. \u00a7 1915(e)(2)(B)(i) &amp; (ii). This dismissal counts as a \u201cprior occasion\u201d or \u201cstrike\u201d for the purposes of the \u201cthree strikes\u201d provision of the Prison Litigation Reform Act, as set forth in \u00a7 1915(g).</p>\n<footnote label=\"**\">\n<p id=\"b1002-17\"> This order and judgment is not binding precedent, except under the doctrines of law of the case, res judicata, and collateral estoppel. This court generally disfavors the citation of orders and judgments; nevertheless, an order and judgment may be cited under the terms and conditions of 10th Cir. R. 36.3.</p>\n</footnote>\n</opinion>\n</casebody>\n",
