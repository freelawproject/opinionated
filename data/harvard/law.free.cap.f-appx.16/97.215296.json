He appeals claiming, first, that Congress exceeded its authority under the Commerce Clause in enacting \u00a7 922(g), relying primarily upon <em>United States v. Lopez, </em>514 U.S. 549, 115 S.Ct. 1624, 131 L.Ed.2d 626 (1995) (invalidating 18 U.S .C. \u00a7 922(q)(l)(A)). This claim has been considered and rejected by this court. <em>See United States v. Gallimore, </em>247 F.3d 134 (4th Cir.2001); <em>United States v. Nathan, </em>202 F.3d 230, 234 (4th Cir.) (upholding \u00a7 922(g)(1)), <em>cert. denied, </em>529 U.S. 1123, 120 S.Ct. 1994, 146 L.Ed.2d 819 (2000); <em>United States v. Bostic, </em>168 F.3d 718 (4th Cir.) (upholding \u00a7 922(g)(8)), <em>cert. denied, </em>527 U.S. 1029, 119 S.Ct. 2383, 144 L.Ed.2d 785 (1999).</p>\n<p id=\"b122-8\">Next, Rodriquez argues that the evidence was insufficient to support his conviction and that his sentence under 18 U.S.C. \u00a7 924(e) should be vacated in light of the Supreme Court\u2019s recent opinion in <em>Apprendi v. New Jersey, </em>530 U.S. 466, 120 S.Ct. 2348, 147 L.Ed.2d 435 (2000). We find that the testimony at Rodriquez\u2019s trial supported his conviction of possessing the firearm found in the trunk of his car. His challenges to the government\u2019s witness\u2019 credibility are not reviewable by this court. <em>See United States v. Saunders, </em>886 F.2d 56, 60 (4th Cir.1989). Rodriquez\u2019s reliance on <em>Apprendi </em>is misplaced because \u00a7 924(e) \u2014 which is based on prior convictions \u2014 is specifically excluded from the holding of <em>Apprendi. </em>120 S.Ct. at 2362-63.</p>\n<p id=\"b122-10\">Rodriquez also argues that the evidence was insufficient to support his sentence as an armed career criminal in that he never conceded the validity of his prior convictions. The presentence report noted three prior violent felonies, the validity of which Rodriquez never challenged. Because each of the crimes qualifies as a \u201cviolent felony\u201d within the meaning of \u00a7 924(e), the district court did not err in sentencing Rodriquez as an armed career criminal.</p>\n<p id=\"b122-11\">Finally, Rodriquez claims that the district court improperly imposed a two-level enhancement for obstruction of justice pursuant to <em>U.S. Sentencing Guidelines Manual </em>\u00a7 3C1.1 (1998). Rodriquez did not object at sentencing; therefore, this claim is reviewed only for plain error. The district court imposed the enhancement because the court concluded that Rodriquez had committed perjury when he testified that he had no knowledge of the firearm found in his trunk. We find that the district court\u2019s conclusions were supported by the record and therefore the court did not plainly err in imposing the enhancement. <em>See United States v. Smith, </em>62 F.3d 641, 646 (4th Cir.1995).</p>\n<p id=\"b122-12\">Accordingly, we affirm Rodriquez\u2019s conviction and sentence. We dispense with oral argument because the facts and legal contentions are adequately presented in the materials before the court and argument would not aid the decisional process.</p>\n<p id=\"b122-13\">\n<em>AFFIRMED.</em>\n</p>\n</opinion>\n</casebody>\n",
