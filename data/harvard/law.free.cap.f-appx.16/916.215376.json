R.App. P. 34(a)(2); 10th Cir. R. 34.1(G). The case is therefore ordered submitted without oral argument.</p>\n<p id=\"b941-6\">Heriberto Huerta appeals the district court\u2019s dismissal of his Petition for Writ of Habeas Corpus, which he brought pursuant to 28 U.S.C. \u00a7 2241. Mr. Huerta is serving a life sentence for conspiracy and distribution of controlled substances, and is presently being held in administrative segregation at the maximum security prison in Florence, Colorado. Because we conclude that \u00a7 2241 is the improper vehicle for Mr. Huerta\u2019s grievances, we affirm the district court.</p>\n<p id=\"b941-7\">Mr. Huerta\u2019s \u00a7 2241 action argues that both his transfer to Florence and his segregated confinement were unconstitutional. In dismissing the action, the district court ruled that it amounted to a challenge to the conditions of Mr. Huerta\u2019s confinement, rather than the execution of his sentence. It stated that although Mr. Huerta contended \u201cthat it is not the denial of ... privileges, but the [allegedly unconstitutional] manner in which they were denied\u201d for which he was seeking relief, \u201cit is apparent that the granting of his petition would simply alter the current conditions of his confinement and have no effect on his sentence.\u201d Dist. Ct. Order, filed May 10, 2000 [hereinafter referred to as \u201cDist. Ct. Order\u201d] at 2. Citing <em>McIntosh v. United States Parole Comm\u2019n, </em>115 F.3d 809, 811 (10th Cir.1997), the court ruled that \u201cit is clear that this type of relief may not be granted through a \u00a7 2241 petition.\u201d Dist. Ct. Order at 2.</p>\n<p id=\"b941-10\">On appeal, Mr. Huerta maintains that \u201c[c]learly habeas corpus relief is available for attacking constitutional questions of how a sentence is being served.\u201d Aplt\u2019s Br. at 24. In support of this proposition, he cites <em>In Re: Medley, </em>134 U.S. 160, 10 S.Ct. 384, 33 L.Ed. 835 (1890), and <em>Hutto v. Finney, </em>437 U.S. 678, 98 S.Ct. 2565, 57 L.Ed.2d 522 (1978). Neither case is persuasive on this point. <em>Hutto </em>does suggest that conditions of confinement may be unconstitutional, but it was based on a 42 U.S.C. \u00a7 1983 civil rights action, and makes no mention of habeas petitions. As for <em>Medley, </em>Mr. Huerta cites no particular language within that century-old case. This may be because the <em>Medley </em>Court made only one statement that seems relevant to Mr. Huerta\u2019s argument, and that statement tells us that \u201cunder the writ of habeas corpus we cannot do anything else than discharge the prisoner from the wrongful confinement in the penitentiary under the statute of Colorado invalid as to this case.\u201d <em>Medley, </em>134 U.S. at 173, 10 S.Ct. 384.</p>\n<p id=\"b941-11\">It is true that a \u00a7 2241 action may sometimes \u201cchallenge some matters that occur at prison, such as deprivation of good-time credits and other prison disciplinary matters.\u201d <em>McIntosh, </em>115 F.3d at 811. It is also true that in <em>Preiser v. Rodriguez, </em>411 U.S. 475, 484, 93 S.Ct. 1827, 36 L.Ed.2d 439 (1973), the Supreme Court reserved judgment on the question of whether challenges to prison conditions may be brought under \u00a7 2241. However, this circuit has declared that \u00a7 2241 is to be used in cases challenging the fact or duration of federal custody, and not in cases merely challenging prison conditions. <em>See McIntosh, </em>115 F.3d at 812. Here, Mr. Huerta\u2019s own habeas petition states that his action is a challenge to the conditions <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"918\">*918</page-number>of his confinement, not the ultimate fact that he is confined. Petition for Writ of Habeas Corpus at 2.<footnotemark>1</footnotemark> Moreover, Mr. Huerta is serving a life sentence. He has made no allegation that his action, even if successful, would result in any direct change in the duration of his confinement.</p>\n<p id=\"b942-4\">For the foregoing reasons, we agree with the magistrate judge that the correct vehicle for Mr. Huerta\u2019s complaint is a civil rights action under <em>Bivens v. Six Unknown Named Agents of the Federal Bureau of Narcotics, </em>403 U.S. 388, 91 S.Ct. 1999, 29 L.Ed.2d 619 (1971). Report and Recommendation of United States Magistrate Judge, filed Mar. 16, 2000, at 6. Accordingly, we AFFIRM the district court\u2019s dismissal of this \u00a7 2241 petition.</p>\n<footnote label=\"*\">\n<p id=\"b940-9\"> This order and judgment is not binding precedent, except under the doctrines of law of the case, res judicata, and collateral estoppel. <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"917\">*917</page-number>The court generally disfavors the citation of orders and judgments; nevertheless, an order and judgment may be cited under the terms and conditions of 10th Cir. R. 36.3.</p>\n</footnote>\n<footnote label=\"1\">\n<p id=\"b942-15\">. We acknowledge that in <em>Montez v. McKinna, </em>208 F.3d 862 (10th Cir.2000), we held that an attack \u201con where [the petitioner\u2019s] sentence will be served ... seems to fit ... under the rubric of \u00a7 2241.\u201d <em>Id. </em>at 865. In a sense, Mr. Huerta's cause of action is a challenge to where his sentence will be served, as he asks for a transfer to a \"true general population unit of an approved correctional facility.\u201d Petition for Writ of Habeas Corpus at 30 (emphasis omitted). But <em>Montez </em>is distinguishable from this case; in <em>Montez, </em>the petitioner alleged that the State of Wyoming could not constitutionally confine him in a privately run prison in Colorado. He did not argue, as Mr. Huerta does, that he was being treated in an unconstitutional manner in the course of an otherwise lawful confinement.</p>\n</footnote>\n</opinion>\n</casebody>\n",
