Larry G. Massanari has been appointed to serve as Acting Commissioner of Social Security, and is substituted as appellee pursuant to Federal Rule of Appellate Procedure 43(c)(2).</p>\n</footnote>\n<opinion data-order=\"7\" data-type=\"opinion\" id=\"x999-2\" type=\"majority\">\n<author id=\"b560-10\">PER CURIAM.</author>\n<p id=\"b560-11\">Roberta Norfleet appeals the district court\u2019s<footnotemark>2</footnotemark> order affirming the Commissioner\u2019s decision to deny supplemental security income benefits. Norfleet alleged disability since January 1984 from back pain. After a careful review of the record, <em>see Gowell v. Apfel, </em>242 F.3d 793, 796 (8th Cir.2001) (standard of review), we affirm.</p>\n<p id=\"b560-12\">Norfleet first argues the administrative law judge (ALJ) improperly analyzed her mental impairment, and ignored evidence that her pain was psychological in origin. We reject this argument, because the record shows that the ALJ complied with the process for evaluating mental impairments, as described in the applicable regulations. <em>See </em>20 C.F.R. \u00a7 416.920a (2001) (evaluation of mental impairment); <em>Gowell, </em>242 F.3d at 795 n. 2, 796, 798 (court will not disturb decision of ALJ who considers, but for good cause expressly discredits, claimant\u2019s complaints of disabling pain, even in cases involving psychogenic symptoms resembling those of physical disease; disability finding is disfavored where claimant presents no evidence of ongoing counseling or psychiatric treatment, or change in mental capabilities); <em>Smith v. Shalala, </em>987 F.2d 1371, 1375 (8th Cir.1993) (substantial evidence supported ALJ\u2019s discounting of psychiatrist\u2019s opinion that claimant suffered from disabling mental impairments where, inter alia, claimant did not allege mental impairment in disability application).</p>\n<p id=\"b560-16\">We also reject Norfleet\u2019s assertion that the ALJ\u2019s hypothetical to the vocational expert did not fully describe her limitations. <em>See Roberts v. Apfel, </em>222 F.3d 466, 471 (8th Cir.2000) (vocational expert testimony constitutes substantial evidence when testimony is based on hypothetical that captures concrete consequences of claimant\u2019s deficiencies; hypothetical is proper if it sets forth impairments accepted as true by ALJ).</p>\n<p id=\"b560-17\">Accordingly, we affirm. <em>See </em>8th Cir. R. 47B.</p>\n<p id=\"b560-18\">A true copy.</p>\n<footnote label=\"2\">\n<p id=\"b560-13\">. The Honorable Fernando J.
