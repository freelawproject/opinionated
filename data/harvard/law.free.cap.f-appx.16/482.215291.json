R.App. P. 34(a)(2). Because the appellee has not filed a responsive brief, the appeal is submitted on the appellant's brief and the record.</p>\n</footnote>\n<opinion data-order=\"7\" data-type=\"opinion\" id=\"x999-2\" type=\"majority\">\n<p id=\"b507-16\">ORDER</p>\n<p id=\"b507-17\">Hilary Beck, unhappy with what he calls the IRS\u2019s \u201cillegal confiscation\u201d of more than $3,000 in tax debt from his checking account, petitioned the district court to prohibit certain IRS employees from engaging in further \u201cdeprivations\u201d of his property. Suspecting that Beck\u2019s real purpose was to evade the income tax, the district court twice ordered him to show cause why his suit was not barred by the Anti-Injunction Act, <em>see </em>26 U.S.C. \u00a7 7421(a). Unconvinced by Beck\u2019s responses, the district court denied his petition. Beck appeals.</p>\n<p id=\"b507-18\">The Anti-Injunction Act forbids the maintenance of a suit brought for the purpose of \u201crestraining the assessment or collection of any tax.\u201d <em>See id. </em>The Act bars groundless suits to defeat collection efforts, even those styled as objections to the IRS\u2019s assessment and collection methods rather than to the tax itself. <em>See Harrell v. United States, </em>13 F.3d 232, 234-35 (7th Cir.1993). Though Beck takes issue with the IRS employees\u2019 \u201charassing forays\u201d directed at his business associates and their failure to provide \u201cdocumentation\u201d of his tax liability, his repeated assertions that he is a \u201csovereign citizen\u201d and \u201cnot subject to tax\u201d \u2014 arguments we have repeatedly rejected, see, <em>e.g., United States v. Hilgeford, </em>7 F.3d 1340, 1342 (7th Cir. 1993) \u2014 reveal that the purpose of his suit <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"484\">*484</page-number>is to challenge his tax liability. As such, his suit is barred by the Act.</p>\n<p id=\"b508-4\">AFFIRMED.</p>\n</opinion>\n</casebody>\n",
