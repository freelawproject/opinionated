Three reported violations for use of marijuana resulted in the court ordering more intense supervision. Revocation proceedings were then commenced when Woodward failed to make required restitution payments despite an apparent ability to do so. After an evidentiary hearing, the district court<footnotemark>1</footnotemark> found four violations of supervised release conditions, revoked supervised release, and sentenced Woodward to twenty-four months in prison with no further supervised release. Woodward appeals his revocation sentence. Having carefully reviewed the sentencing record, we conclude that the evidence supports the district court\u2019s finding of four violations, and the court properly considered all four in deciding that revocation had become the appropriate sanction. The twenty-four-month sentence was not an upward departure because the policy statements in Chapter 7 of the Sentencing Guidelines are not binding guidelines. <em>See United States v. Shaw, </em>180 F.3d 920, 922 (8th Cir.1999).</p>\n<p id=\"b576-15\">Accordingly, we affirm. We grant counsel\u2019s motion to withdraw.</p>\n<footnote label=\"1\">\n<p id=\"b576-12\">. The HONORABLE DEAN WHIPPLE, Chief Judge of the United States District Court for the Western District of Missouri.</p>\n</footnote>\n</opinion>\n</casebody>\n",
