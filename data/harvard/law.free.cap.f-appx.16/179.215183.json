The district court entered an order denying AMnkoye\u2019s motion on October 5, 2000. However, Akinkoye did not file a notice of appeal until March 6, 2001, in which he indicated that <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"180\">*180</page-number>he did not receive notice of the order to be appealed until that day. Where, as here, a pro se appellant files an untimely notice of appeal offering some excuse for its untimeliness, that notice is properly construed as a motion to reopen the time to note an appeal under Fed. R.App. P. 4(a)(6). <em>See United States v. Feuver, </em>236 F.3d 725, 729 n. 7 (D.C.Cir.2001). Accordingly, we remand the case to the district court for the court to determine whether Aldnkoye can satisfy the requirements of Rule 4(a)(6). <em>See Ogden v. San Juan Cnty., </em>32 F.3d 452, 454 (10th Cir.1994). The record, as supplemented, will then be returned to this court for further consideration.</p>\n<p id=\"b204-4\">\n<em>REMANDED.</em>\n</p>\n</opinion>\n</casebody>\n",
