Because Appellee bravely waived exhaustion of plan remedies, we turn directly to the merits of the case. We review the district court\u2019s interpretation de novo. <em>See Boston Mut. Ins. v. Murphree, </em>242 F.3d 899, 902 (9th Cir. 2001) (\u201cWe review the district court\u2019s ... interpretation of the [ERISA] Plan\u2019s coordination clause, de novo.\u201d).</p>\n<p id=\"b832-22\">We find that under the terms of the Boeing Layoff Plan, Appellants do not qualify for layoff benefits. Although the decision to terminate their current position was involuntary, Boeing gave Appellants the opportunity to seek alternative employment within Boeing. If they could not find such employment within a certain time period, Appellants then would have been laid off-and thus entitled to benefits at that time. Here, Appellants declined to <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"809\">*809</page-number>seek other employment within Boeing. Rather, they voluntarily resigned in order to take a position with IBM/GTE. Consequently, their decision to leave employment with Boeing was voluntary.</p>\n<p id=\"b833-5\">Furthermore, because Appellants failed to show reasonable and detrimental reliance, extraordinary circumstances, or that the provisions of the plan at issue were ambiguous such that reasonable persons could disagree as to their meaning or effect, Boeing is not collaterally estopped from raising the issues therein. <em>Spink v. Lockheed Corp., </em>125 F.3d 1257, 1262 (9th Cir.1997).</p>\n<p id=\"b833-6\">Finally, we find that because Appellants potentially had a remedy under \u00a7 502(a)(1)(B), they are not entitled to relief under \u00a7 502(a)(3). <em>See Bowles v. Reade, </em>198 F.3d 752, 760 (9th Cir.1999) (holding that plaintiff was not entitled to relief under \u00a7 502(a)(3) where relief she sought was provided by \u00a7 502(a)(2)); <em>Forsyth v. Humana, Inc., </em>114 F.3d 1467, 1475 (9th Cir.1997) (holding that plaintiffs were not entitled to relief under \u00a7 502(a)(3) where they received relief under \u00a7 502(a)(1)(B)), <em>aff'd, </em>525 U.S. 299, 119 S.Ct. 710, 142 L.Ed.2d 753 (1999).</p>\n<p id=\"b833-7\">AFFIRMED.</p>\n<footnote label=\"*\">\n<p id=\"b832-15\"><em> </em>This disposition is not appropriate for publication and may not be cited to or by the courts of this circuit except as provided by Ninth Cir.
