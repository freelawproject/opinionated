Mitchell appeals his conviction and sentence of 120 months imprisonment following a guilty plea to one count of possessing with intent to distribute cocaine base in violation of 21 U.S.C. \u00a7\u00a7 841(a)(1) and 841(b)(1)(A). This plea reserved the right to appeal the denial of his motion to suppress evidence obtained during his warrantless arrest. Upon <em>de novo </em>review of the evidence \u201cin the light most likely to support the district court\u2019s decision,\u201d the denial of the motion to suppress was not erroneous as the arrest was supported by probable cause. <em>See United States v.. Reed, </em>141 F.3d 644, 648 (6th Cir.1998)(internal quotations and citation omitted); <em>United States v. Strickland, </em>144 F.3d 412, 415 (6th Cir.1998). We affirm.</p>\n<p id=\"b392-23\">On April 15, 1999, Officer Bruce Conkey received two telephone calls from Rochelle Evans, Mitchell\u2019s ex-girlfriend. She stated <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"369\">*369</page-number>that Mitchell and another individual named Rhondell Grogan were selling crack cocaine from the Executive Inn, a local motel. After indicating that Grogan\u2019s maroon van was being used to deliver the drugs, Evans gave Mitchell\u2019s pager number to Officer Conkey.</p>\n<p id=\"b393-5\">Officer Conkey was familiar with Mitchell\u2019s previous involvement in drug-related activities and knew that Evans had criminal charges pending against her. Nonetheless, he soon placed a call to the pager from an undercover telephone line belonging to the Knoxville Police Department, asked for Mitchell by his nickname, \u201cG-Wayne,\u201d and left the code number \u201c250\u201d which signified that he wanted to purchase one-quarter ounce of crack cocaine. Mitchell returned the call ten minutes later, asking Officer Conkey to meet him at Hardee\u2019s next to the Executive Inn on Chapman Highway. A second call was made by Officer Conkey to the pager approximately forty-five minutes later to further confirm the deal and advise Mitchell what vehicle Officer Conkey would be driving.</p>\n<p id=\"b393-6\">Almost immediately after this call, the officers in the undercover vehicle noticed a maroon van pull into the parking lot of the meeting location. Grogan was driving and Mitchell was seated on the passenger\u2019s side. The officers approached the van and Grogan was asked to exit the vehicle. As he exited, the officers observed Grogan drop a clear plastic baggie containing marijuana. A pat down search of Grogan revealed a small quantity of crack cocaine. Mitchell was then asked to step out of the van to enable the officers to perform a pat down search during which a one-quarter ounce bag of crack cocaine and a pager containing the telephone numbers from the Knoxville Police Department\u2019s undercover line were found.</p>\n<p id=\"b393-7\">Approximately two hours after his arrest, Mitchell gave a statement to the police admitting his possession of the crack cocaine and his intent to sell it to Officer Conkey.</p>\n<p id=\"b393-9\">From the \u201ctotality of the circumstances,\u201d the officers had reason to believe from their experiences \u201cthat criminal activity may be afoot and that persons with whom [they were] dealing may be armed and presently dangerous,\u201d thus enabling them to stop the vehicle in which defendant and Grogan were riding. <em>United States v.. Caicedo, </em>85 F.3d 1184, 1189-90 (6th Cir.1996); <em>Terry v. Ohio, </em>392 U.S. 1, 30, 88 S.Ct. 1868, 20 L.Ed.2d 889 (1968).</p>\n<p id=\"b393-10\">The officers\u2019 observation of Grogan\u2019s tossing the bag of marijuana after he exited the van justified his pat down. A small quantity of cocaine was also found in his hat. When Mitchell exited the vehicle, he was observed holding a room key to the Executive Inn located next door to Hardee\u2019s. During Mitchell\u2019s pat down, Officer Bernhard Braeuner felt a sharp-edged object in Mitchell\u2019s pants that he recognized to be crack cocaine. This object was obtainable under <em>Minnesota v. Dickerson, </em>508 U.S. 366, 373, 113 S.Ct. 2130, 124 L.Ed.2d 334 (1993)(holding that police may seize non-threatening contraband detected by touch during a legitimate <em>Terry </em>search).</p>\n<p id=\"b393-11\">The officers had probable cause to arrest Mitchell as they had within their knowledge \u201cfacts and circumstances.. .sufficient to warrant a prudent person, or one of reasonable caution, in believing in the circumstances shown that [defendant] has committed, is committing, or is about to commit an offense.\u201d <em>Painter v. Robertson, </em>185 F.3d 557, 569 (6th Cir.l999)(quoting <em>Michigan v. DeFillipo, </em>443 U.S. 31, 37, 99 S.Ct. 2627, 61 L.Ed.2d 343 (1979)). These specific concrete facts and circumstances supported more than a mere suspicion of criminal activity. <em>See Strickland, </em>144 F.3d at 415-16.</p>\n<p id=\"b393-12\">Mitchell argues that the facts known to Officer Conkey do not satisfy probable <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"370\">*370</page-number>cause as nothing indicates that the meeting was illegal, though he concedes that an individual\u2019s agreeing on the phone to meet a virtual stranger is odd. He also challenges the initial source of Officer Con-key\u2019s information regarding the alleged sale of drugs from Grogan\u2019s maroon van on the ground that his ex-girlfriend\u2019s information was not reliable.</p>\n<p id=\"b394-4\"><em>Illinois v. Gates, </em>462 U.S. 213, 241, 103 S.Ct. 2317, 76 L.Ed.2d 527 (1983), notes that \u201c[Supreme Court] decisions applying the totality-of-the-circumstances analysis. . .have consistently recognized the value of corroboration of details of an informant\u2019s tip by independent police work.\u201d Evans\u2019s statements were corroborated by Officer Conkey when he called the pager number, recognized Mitchell\u2019s voice, and arranged the crack cocaine purchase.</p>\n<p id=\"b394-5\">AFFIRMED.</p>\n</opinion>\n</casebody>\n",
