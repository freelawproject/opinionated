The parties are familiar with the facts underlying this appeal, so we need not repeat them here. This court has jurisdiction pursuant to 28 U.S.C. \u00a7 1291, and we affirm.</p>\n<p id=\"b626-28\">We review de novo the denial of a motion to dismiss an indictment on due process grounds. <em>United States v. Eshkol, </em>108 F.3d 1025, 1027 (9th Cir.1997). We <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"603\">*603</page-number>review de novo the denial of a defendant\u2019s collateral attack on a deportation proceeding. Un<em>ited States v. Garza-Sanchez, </em>217 F.3d 806, 808 (9th Cir.2000). We review a claim under <em>Apprendi v. New Jersey, </em>530 U.S. 466, 120 S.Ct. 2348, 147 L.Ed.2d 435 (2000), for plain error when raised for the first time on appeal. <em>United States v. Castillo-Rivera, </em>244 F.3d 1020, 1024 (9th Cir .2001).</p>\n<p id=\"b627-5\">Gomez contends that the district court erred by denying his motion to dismiss the indictment because, as an alien with an aggravated felony conviction, he was barred from judicial review of the underlying deportation order pursuant to 8 U.S.C. \u00a7 1252(a)(2)(C) and therefore that deportation cannot be used as the basis for his current criminal conviction. This argument has no merit because Gomez was able to collaterally attack the deportation order in district court and thereby availed himself of an alternative means of judicial review sufficient to satisfy due process. <em>See United States v. Herrera-Blanco, </em>232 F.3d 715, 718 (9th Cir.2000).</p>\n<p id=\"b627-6\">Gomez also contends that the deportation proceeding was procedurally defective because the immigration judge did not obtain an individualized waiver of his right to appeal and did not explain the potential for relief from deportation. In order to succeed with such a collateral attack, Gomez must demonstrate that his due process rights were violated by the defects and that he suffered prejudice as a result. <em>See United States v. Arrieta, </em>224 F.3d 1076, 1079 (9th Cir.2000). To show prejudice, Gomez must offer \u201cplausible grounds of relief which might have been available to him but for the deprivation of rights.\u201d <em>United States v. Zarate-Martinez, </em>133 F.3d 1194, 1198 (9th Cir.1998) (quoting <em>United States v. Leon-Leon, </em>35 F.3d 1428, 1432 (9th Cir.1994)). Even assuming procedural defect, Gomez offers no basis for finding prejudice. He concedes he had an aggravated felony conviction at the time of his deportation. Thus, neither cancellation of removal nor voluntary departure is a plausible ground' of relief which might have been available. <em>See </em>8 U.S.C. \u00a7\u00a7 1229b(a)(3), 1229c(a)(1) and (b)(1)(C).</p>\n<p id=\"b627-9\">Finally, Gomez contends that an aggravated felony conviction is an element under 8 U.S.C. \u00a7 1326(b) which was neither charged in the indictment nor proved beyond a reasonable doubt, and thus his sentence enhancement violates <em>Apprendi. </em>This argument is foreclosed by <em>United States v. Pacheco-Zepeda, </em>234 F.3d 411, 413-15 (9th Cir.2000).</p>\n<p id=\"b627-10\">AFFIRMED.</p>\n<footnote label=\"**\">\n<p id=\"b626-29\"> This disposition is not appropriate for publication and may not be cited to or by the courts of this circuit except as provided by Ninth Cir.
