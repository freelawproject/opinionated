IHI then filed for bankruptcy in North Carolina, and the SEC filed a proof of claim. The SEC, the bankruptcy trustee, and Acstar entered into a court-approved settlement that, among other things, reduced Acstar\u2019s payment obligation under the bond. As part of the settlement, the court ordered the trustee and Acstar to execute mutual releases. Acstar thereafter filed an amended proof of claim for the amount of the bond payment that IHI\u2019s collateral did not cover and asserted a security interest in the proceeds of one of IHI\u2019s insurance policies. The bankruptcy court disallowed Acstar\u2019s amended claim, and the district court affirmed. Because the release that the bankruptcy court ordered Acstar to execute bars Acstar from asserting any additional claims against the bankruptcy estate, we affirm.</p>\n<p id=\"b238-14\">I.</p>\n<p id=\"b238-15\">In March 1998 the SEC brought a securities fraud action against IHI, a consumer goods marketing organization, in the Northern District of Georgia. At the outset of the SEC suit the Georgia district court ordered IHI to post a $5 million cash bond to assure that IHI\u2019s liquid assets were not diminished during the pendency of the action and that funds were available to satisfy any judgment issued against IHI. After IHI posted the cash bond, it sought permission from the court to substitute the cash bond with a payment bond. IHI entered into an agreement with Acstar by which Acstar would post the payment bond. Under the agreement Acstar received $3 .5 million in collateral and a $150,000 fee for its services. The district court approved the substitution.</p>\n<p id=\"b238-16\">In November 1998 IHI filed for bankruptcy in the Eastern District of North Carolina. Holmes P. Harden was appointed bankruptcy trustee. The SEC filed a proof of claim with the bankruptcy court in the amount of $6,450,000, representing the SEC\u2019s estimate of IHI\u2019s fraud that was the subject of the Georgia action. <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"215\">*215</page-number>Harden entered into negotiations with the SEC that resulted in settlement terms that would be submitted for court approval. Thereafter, in January 1999 Harden applied to the bankruptcy court for permission to enter into a \u201cStipulation and Consent to Final Judgment of Permanent Injunction.\u201d Acstar filed an objection to Harden\u2019s application, arguing that under its payment bond agreement with IHI, Acstar had the exclusive right to settle with the SEC. Acstar also threatened to take legal action against Harden. All of the parties (Harden, the SEC, and Acstar) entered into mediation and reached a more comprehensive settlement in June 1999. Acstar would pay the SEC $4.1 million \u201cin full settlement of its obligations under the SEC bond.\u201d A 300-day payment plan was devised, and Acstar was allowed a priority status claim in the bankruptcy action in the amount of $300,000. This \u201cpriority\u201d claim is \u201centitled to be paid before other unsecured, nonpriority claims.\u201d 2 William L. Norton, Jr., <em>Norton Bankruptcy Law &amp; Practice 2d </em>\u00a7 42:1, at 42-3 (1997). The bankruptcy court approved this settlement and ordered Harden and Acstar to execute mutual releases. Acstar was to execute a release that provided:</p>\n<blockquote id=\"b239-5\">For valuable consideration, the receipt of which is hereby acknowledged, [Acstar] and [its] respective successors and assigns do hereby release, forever discharge and promise never to sue Holmes P. Harden, individually, as Chapter 7 Trustee for [IHI], or as a principal in the law firm of Maupin Taylor &amp; Ellis, P.A., or the law firm of Maupin Taylor &amp; Ellis, P.A, their agents, attorneys, employees, officers, directors, and insurance carriers (together referred to as \u201cHarden\u201d) for any and all damages and claims arising from or related to the [SEC] civil action ... including but not limited to Harden\u2019s filing of the Application of Trustee to Enter into Stipulation and Consent to Final Judgment of Permanent Injunction [the SEC settlement] ... and any claims relating to the subsequent Consent Order, and any claims against Harden arising from, under, or against Payment Bond No. 7719 dated June 5, 1998 and a related Indemnity Agreement which were executed in connection with the aforesaid civil action.</blockquote>\n<p id=\"AEK\">Harden was to execute a release that was substantially the same. Harden executed his court-approved release, but Acstar made some unilateral changes on the release it signed.</p>\n<p id=\"b239-8\">On August 9, 1999, Harden applied to the bankruptcy court for permission to enter into a settlement agreement with Executive Risk Specialty Insurance Company (ERSIC). ERSIC had issued IHI a \u201cDirectors and Officers Liability Insurance Policy,\u201d which covers, among other things, securities claims. Harden asserted that the losses from the SEC action were covered under the ERSIC policy. Acstar objected to the proposed settlement between Harden and ERSIC, arguing that Acstar had a security interest in funds paid by ERSIC because of its (Acstar\u2019s) indemnity agreement with IHI. The indemnity agreement provided that IHI assigned to Acstar a security interest in \u201call sums due or to become due ... in connection with any contract.\u201d The bankruptcy court overruled the objections and approved the settlement.</p>\n<p id=\"b239-9\">In October 1999 Acstar filed an amended proof of claim with the bankruptcy court for $805,781.41. This amount represents, according to Acstar, \u201cmoney paid by ACSTAR on behalf of IHI on the Bond less the remaining collateral\u201d and \u201cfees of attorneys and other expenses which ACS-TAR has incurred in recovering or attempting to recover losses or expenses paid or incurred in connection with the Bond.\u201d Acstar again asserted a security <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"216\">*216</page-number>interest in the ERSIC insurance policy proceeds. Harden objected to Acstar\u2019s amended proof of claim. The bankruptcy court allowed the objection. Acstar appealed to the district court, which affirmed the bankruptcy court. Acstar now appeals to this court.</p>\n<p id=\"b240-4\">II.</p>\n<p id=\"b240-5\">\u201cWe review de novo the decision of the district court, effectively standing in its place to review directly the findings of fact and conclusions of law made by the bankruptcy court. While we exercise plenary review of the bankruptcy court\u2019s legal conclusions, its factual findings may not be set aside unless they are clearly erroneous.\u201d <em>Butler v. David Shaw, Inc., </em>72 F.3d 437, 44-41 (4th Cir.1996) (citations omitted).</p>\n<p id=\"b240-6\">Harden maintains that Acstar is barred from asserting any additional claims against the estate because of the mutual releases the court ordered Harden and Acstar to execute as part of the settlement with the SEC. Acstar argues that the release only applies to Harden individually, and not to the bankruptcy estate. Acstar claims that this individual release arose out of Acstar\u2019s prior threats to sue Harden and his law firm over what Acstar considered an unfair settlement with the SEC.</p>\n<p id=\"b240-7\">A release is interpreted according to general principles of contract construction. If the language is clear and unambiguous, a court should interpret the release according to its plain meaning. If the terms are ambiguous, however, the trier of fact can look to extrinsic evidence in order to determine the meaning of the release. <em>See Farmers Bank, Pilot Mountain v. Michael T. Brown Distribs., Inc., </em>307 N.C. 342, 298 S.E.2d 357, 360 (N.C. 1983); <em>Lagies v. Myers, </em>542 S.E.2d 336, 341-42 (N.C.Ct.App.2001); <em>Holshouser v. Shaner Hotel Group Props., </em>134 N.C.App. 391, 518 S.E.2d 17, 23 (N.C.Ct.App.1999). As our discussion below will demonstrate, extrinsic evidence cannot be considered in this case because the language of the release is clear.</p>\n<p id=\"b240-9\">We must first identify which release we are analyzing. Instead of signing the required release, Acstar signed a release that it had unilaterally revised. We refuse to consider the revisions. The bankruptcy court ordered that \u201cthe Trustee and the Sureties shall execute the mutual releases attached hereto as Exhibit B.\u201d Exhibit B contained the language quoted in part I of this opinion. Acstar is bound by the court\u2019s order and was not free to revise the terms of the release.</p>\n<p id=\"b240-10\">We hold that the language of the court-ordered release unambiguously precludes Acstar from making any additional claims against the bankruptcy estate. The release contains a clear promise by Acstar to cease making claims against Harden, as a representative of IHI\u2019s bankruptcy estate. The terms release Harden in three ways: (1) \u201cindividually,\u201d (2) \u201cas Chapter 7 Trustee for [IHI],\u201d and (3) \u201cas a principal in the law firm of Maupin Taylor &amp; Ellis, P.A.\u201d Releasing Harden \u201cas Chapter 7 Trustee\u201d is equivalent to releasing the estate. The trustee is \u201cthe representative of the estate\u201d and \u201chas capacity to sue and be sued\u201d on behalf of the estate. 11 U.S.C. \u00a7 323. <em>See also Bellini Imports, Ltd. v. Mason &amp; Dixon Lines, Inc., </em>944 F.2d 199, 202 (4th Cir.1991) (\u201cThe trustee ... must be named as a party defendant in an action seeking to proceed against assets of the estate.\u201d (citations omitted)). This role is consistent with the Bankruptcy Code\u2019s placement of \u201cthe incidents of ownership of property of the estate\u201d in the hands of the trustee. 1 Norton, <em>supra, </em>\u00a7 23:1, at 23-3. By releasing Harden \u201cas Chapter 7 Trustee,\u201d Acstar forfeited any additional claims against the bankruptcy estate.</p>\n<p id=\"b240-11\">Aestar\u2019s argument that the release only precludes claims against Harden in his <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"217\">*217</page-number>individual capacity fails in the face of the plain language of the release. The release includes Harden \u201cindividually\u201d and as \u201ca principal in [his] law firm.\u201d But it also includes Harden \u201cas Chapter 7 Trustee.\u201d Acstar\u2019s reading of the release renders the \u201cChapter 7 Trustee\u201d language superfluous. Our reading of the release gives all of the words their plain meaning. <em>See Marcoin, Inc. v. McDaniel, </em>70 N.C.App. 498, 320 S.E.2d 892, 896-97 (N.C.Ct.App.1984) (noting that one of the \u201cbasic principles of contract construction\u201d is to \u201cgiv[e] effect to each [word] whenever possible\u201d). The terms of the release unambiguously release the estate from any further claims by Acstar.</p>\n<p id=\"b241-5\">III.</p>\n<p id=\"b241-6\">Because we hold that Acstar\u2019s amended claim is barred by the release, we do not have to reach the issues of whether Acstar has a perfected security interest or an equitable lien in the ERSIC insurance policy proceeds. In addition, we will not consider Acstar\u2019s alternative arguments that the bankruptcy court\u2019s order should be set aside because the court failed to make factual findings in accordance with Fed.R.Civ.P. 52(a) or that Acstar is entitled to subrogation under 11 U.S.C. \u00a7 509. Acstar waived the former argument by failing to raise it in front of the district court. <em>See Muth v. United States, </em>1 F.3d 246, 250 (4th Cir.1993) (\u201cAs this court has repeatedly held, issues raised for the first time on appeal generally will not be considered.\u201d). Acstar waived the latter argument by raising it for the first time in its reply brief to this court. <em>See Cavallo v. Star Enter., </em>100 F.3d 1150, 1152 n. 2 (4th Cir.1996) (\u201c[A]n issue first argued in a reply brief is not properly before a court of appeals.\u201d).</p>\n<p id=\"b241-7\">In conclusion, we affirm the district court\u2019s order, which affirmed the bankruptcy court\u2019s order allowing the trustee\u2019s objection to Acstar\u2019s amended proof of claim.</p>\n<p id=\"b241-9\">\n<em>AFFIRMED.</em>\n</p>\n</opinion>\n</casebody>\n",
