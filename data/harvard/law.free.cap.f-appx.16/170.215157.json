On appeal, the Plumlees contend the court below was obliged to consider their motion because the Supreme Court\u2019s recent holdings in <em>Apprendi v. New Jersey, </em>530 U.S. 466, 120 S.Ct. 2348, 147 L.Ed.2d 435 (2000), <em>Richardson v. United States, </em>526 U.S. 813, 119 S.Ct. 1707, 143 L.Ed.2d 985 (1999), and <em>Bousley v. United States, </em>523 U.S. 614, 118 S.Ct. 1604, 140 L.Ed.2d 828 (1998), indicate the trial court lacked the subject matter jurisdiction to convict and sentence them. For reasons stated herein, we dismiss their appeal.</p>\n<p id=\"b195-18\">As a preliminary matter, this court has held that <em>Apprendi </em>is not retroactively applicable to cases on collateral review. <em>See United States v. Sanders, </em>247 F.3d 139, 151 (4th Cir.2001). Additionally, the Supreme Court\u2019s decision in <em>Bousley </em>preceded the filing of the Plumlees\u2019 motion by over a year. <em>See </em>523 U.S. 614, 118 S.Ct. 1604, 140 L.Ed.2d 828 (1998). Consequently, their motion is untimely as to each of these claims. <em>See </em>\u00a7 2255 116. Finally, to the extent the Plumlees\u2019 raise a timely challenge to their conviction under <em>Richardson, </em>we note that the jury returned guilty verdicts as to Counts Seven through Ten and Thirteen through Fifteen, all of which are listed as predicate offenses to the continuing criminal enterprise of which they were convicted. Consequently, the district court\u2019s alleged failure to give an instruction meeting the requirements of <em>Richardson </em>constitutes harmless error. <em>See United States v. Brown, </em>202 F.3d 691, 700 (4th Cir.2000) (citing <em>United States v. Escobar-de Jesus, </em>187 F.3d 148, 162 (1st Cir.1999)). Accordingly, we deny a certificate of appealability and dismiss their appeal. We dispense with oral argument because the facts and legal contentions are adequately presented in the materials before the court and argument would not aid the decisional process.</p>\n<p id=\"b195-19\">\n<em>DISMISSED.</em>\n</p>\n</opinion>\n</casebody>\n",
