Each was sentenced principally to 240 years\u2019 imprisonment. In August 1998, this Court affirmed the district court\u2019s judgment of conviction, but vacated defendants\u2019 sentences and remanded the case for resentencing. <em>United States v. Salameh, </em>152 F.3d 88, 161 (2d Cir.1998) <em>(per curiam), cert. denied, </em>525 U.S. 1112, 119 S.Ct. 885, 142 L.Ed.2d 785 (1999) <em>(\u201cSalameh I\u201d). </em>Additionally, this Court declined to exercise appellate jurisdiction over defendants\u2019 claims of ineffective assistance of counsel and remanded those claims, along with defendants\u2019 post-trial motions for a new trial pursuant to Federal Rule of Criminal Procedure 33, to the district court for its consideration. <em>Id. </em>at 160-61.</p>\n<p id=\"b99-4\"><page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"75\">*75</page-number>Thereafter, and subsequent to hearings on defendants\u2019 post-trial motions, the district court denied defendants\u2019 post-trial motions for a new trial in their entirety, resentenced each defendant to a lengthy prison term and imposed on each defendant a fine and restitution. In a separate <em>per curiam </em>opinion filed today, we affirm the sentence imposed by the district court, as modified therein. For the reasons stated below, we affirm the district court\u2019s denial of defendants\u2019 post-trial motions.</p>\n<p id=\"b99-5\">We review a district court\u2019s denial of a motion for a new trial for abuse of discretion. <em>United States v. Torres, </em>128 F.3d 38, 48 (2d Cir.1997). Any findings of fact made by the district court in resolving the motions are to be accepted unless shown to be clearly erroneous. <em>United States v. Gallego, </em>191 F.3d 156, 161 (2d Cir.1999), <em>cert. denied, </em>530 U.S. 1216, 120 S.Ct. 2220, 147 L.Ed.2d 252 (2000).</p>\n<p id=\"b99-6\">1. Defendants assert that they are entitled to a new trial based on, <em>inter alia, </em>supposed newly discovered evidence that Federal Bureau of Investigations (\u201cFBI\u201d) Supervisory Special Agent David Williams gave perjured testimony at their trial. We disagree.</p>\n<p id=\"b99-7\">Defendants\u2019 allegations of perjury by Agent Williams rest foursquare on a report issued after defendants\u2019 trial by the Office of the Inspector General for the Department of Justice (the \u201cInspector General\u2019s Office\u201d). <em>See </em>Michael R. Bromwich, Inspector General, <em>The FBI Laboratory: An Investigation into Laboratory Practices and Alleged Misconduct in Explosives Related and Other Cases </em>(April 1997) (the \u201cInspector General\u2019s Report\u201d or the \u201cReport\u201d). The Inspector General\u2019s Report, <em>inter alia, </em>criticized several aspects of Agent Williams\u2019s trial testimony, all of which supported the government\u2019s theory that urea nitrate was the main charge used in the bomb that exploded under the World Trade Center. This included his testimony about: (1) the defendants\u2019 capacity to manufacture a bomb composed of urea nitrate; (2) the size and composition of the bomb that exploded under the World Trade Center; (3) disputes he had with FBI Special Supervisory Agent Dr. Frederic Whitehurst concerning the substance of the FBI\u2019s reports detailing the findings of its investigation; and (4) the FBI\u2019s attempts to manufacture a bomb composed primarily of urea nitrate and his role in such attempts. Although we accept the Inspector General\u2019s Report that Agent Williams, at times, offered \u201cinaccurate and incomplete testimony,\u201d <em>Inspector General\u2019s Report </em>at 83, we conclude that a new trial is not warranted.</p>\n<p id=\"b99-9\">\u201c[Rjelief is justified under Rule 33 only if the newly-discovered evidence\u201d: (1) \u201ccould not have been discovered, exercising due diligence, before or during trial\u201d; (2) is \u201cmaterial\u201d; (3) is \u201cnon-cumulative\u201d; and (4) if admitted at trial, would probably have led to an acquittal. <em>Gallego, </em>191 F.3d at 161 (internal quotation marks omitted). In addition to these four requirements, when perjury is alleged as the newly discovered evidence, a defendant must prove that the witness, in fact, offered perjured testimony. <em>United States v. Diaz, </em>176 F.3d 52, 106 (2d Cir.) (citations omitted), <em>cert. denied, </em>528 U.S. 957, 120 S.Ct. 386, 145 L.Ed.2d 301 (1999). Perjury requires more than just showing a witness\u2019s testimony was false \u2014 it must have been <em>intentionally </em>false as to a <em>material </em>matter. 18 U.S.C. \u00a7\u00a7 1621, 1623; <em>United States v. Dunnigan, </em>507 U.S. 87, 94, 113 S.Ct. 1111, 122 L.Ed.2d 445 (1993).</p>\n<p id=\"b99-10\">If the witness perjured himself, but the government was unaware of the perjury during trial, \u201ca new trial is warranted only if the testimony was material and the court [is left] with a firm belief that but for the perjured testimony, the defendant would most likely not have been convict<page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"76\">*76</page-number>ed.\u201d <em>United States v. Moreno, </em>181 F.3d 206, 213 (2d Cir.) (citations omitted), <em>cert. denied, </em>528 U.S. 977, 120 S.Ct. 427, 145 L.Ed.2d 334 (1999). If, on the other hand, \u201cthe prosecution knew or should have known of the perjury, a new trial is warranted if \u2018there is any reasonable likelihood that the false testimony could have affected the judgment of the jury.\u2019 \u201d <em>United States v. Wong, </em>78 F.3d 73, 81 (2d Cir.1996) (quoting <em>United States v. Agurs, </em>427 U.S. 97, 103, 96 S.Ct. 2392, 49 L.Ed.2d 342 (1976)).</p>\n<p id=\"b100-4\">Even if we agreed that Agent Williams\u2019s inaccurate testimony amounted to perjury, the defendants have failed to produce any evidence that the United States Attorney\u2019s Office was aware of this perjury. Moreover, we are not left \u201cwith a firm belief that but for the perjured testimony, the defendants would most likely not have been convicted.\u201d <em>Moreno, </em>181 F.3d at 213 (citation omitted). To the contrary, independent of Williams\u2019s testimony, there is a surfeit of evidence of defendants\u2019 guilt and, specifically, of their manufacture of a bomb, the main charge of which was composed of urea nitrate, and detonation thereof under the World Trade Center. <em>See Salameh I, </em>152 F.3d at 107-09, 151-57.</p>\n<p id=\"b100-5\">In sum, we hold that the district court did not abuse its discretion in denying defendants\u2019 motions for a new trial on grounds that Agent Williams gave perjured testimony at their trial.</p>\n<p id=\"b100-6\">2. Ajaj argues that he is also entitled to a new trial because, <em>inter alia, </em>his trial counsel rendered ineffective assistance in violation of the Sixth Amendment by failing to request an instruction to the jury that, if it found that Ajaj had been part of the conspiracy prior to his incarceration, it could find that, after his incarceration, he withdrew from the conspiracy. We disagree.</p>\n<p id=\"b100-7\">Ajaj asserts that counsel\u2019s failure to request such an instruction was extremely prejudicial in light of the jury\u2019s determination of his guilt under a <em>Pinkerton </em>theory of liability, which \u201cpermits criminal liability of a conspirator for the substantive crimes committed by his co-conspirators to the extent those offenses were reasonably foreseeable consequences of acts furthering the unlawful agreement, even if he did not himself participate in the substantive crimes.\u201d <em>United States v. Bala, </em>236 F.3d 87, 95 (2d Cir.2000) (citation omitted); <em>see also Pinkerton v. United States, </em>328 U.S. 640, 66 S.Ct. 1180, 90 L.Ed. 1489 (1946). At the district court\u2019s post-trial hearing on defendants\u2019 post-trial motions, Ajaj\u2019s trial counsel testified that he did not seek a withdrawal from the conspiracy instruction because it was patently inconsistent with Ajaj\u2019s theory of the case, namely that Ajaj was never part of the conspiracy. Ajaj counters that his trial counsel should have argued in the alternative \u2014 by asking the jury to find either that: (1) Ajaj was never part of the conspiracy; or (2) even if, at one time, he was a part of the conspiracy, he withdrew therefrom upon his incarceration.</p>\n<p id=\"b100-9\">To prevail on a claim of ineffective assistance of counsel, a defendant must demonstrate that: (1) counsel\u2019s performance fell below an \u201cobjective standard of reasonableness\u201d under \u201cprevailing professional norms,\u201d and (2) the alleged insufficiency resulted in prejudice. <em>Strickland v. Washington, </em>466 U.S. 668, 687-88, 104 S.Ct. 2052, 80 L.Ed.2d 674 (1984).</p>\n<p id=\"b100-10\">At the outset, we note that on his prior appeal to this Court we agreed that Ajaj would have been entitled to a withdrawal from the conspiracy instruction had his trial counsel chosen to ask for one. <em>Salameh I, </em>152 F.3d at 150. Nevertheless, a defendant cannot prevail on a claim of ineffective assistance merely because he believes that his counsel\u2019s strategy was inadequate. <em>United States v. Sanchez, </em>790 <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"77\">*77</page-number>F.2d 245, 253 (2d Cir.1986). Similarly, lack of success of a chosen strategy does not warrant judicial second-guessing. <em>United States v. DiTommaso, </em>817 F.2d 201, 215 (2d Cir.1987).</p>\n<p id=\"b101-5\">Moreover, we find that Ajaj\u2019s trial counsel\u2019s decision not to request a withdrawal from the conspiracy instruction was quite reasonable in light of the overwhelming evidence presented by the government that even while in the jailhouse Ajaj had, in fact, continued to communicate with his co-conspirators, in particular Ramzi Yousef, the mastermind of the plot. In light of such evidence, Ajaj also cannot prove that the failure to request such a charge resulted in prejudice under <em>Strickland, </em>because it is highly improbable that if the jury found (as its verdict suggests it did) that Ajaj was part of the conspiracy at the time of his unlawful entry into the United States, it would have believed that he withdrew from the conspiracy upon his incarceration. Accordingly, the district court did not abuse its discretion in denying Ajaj\u2019s motion for a new trial on grounds that his trial counsel rendered ineffective assistance by failing to request a withdrawal from the conspiracy instruction.</p>\n<p id=\"b101-6\">We have considered the remainder of defendants\u2019 arguments and find them to be without merit.</p>\n<p id=\"b101-7\">Accordingly, the district court\u2019s denial of defendants\u2019 post-trial motions for a new trial is AFFIRMED.</p>\n</opinion>\n</casebody>\n",
