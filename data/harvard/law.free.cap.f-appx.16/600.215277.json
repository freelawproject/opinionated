We have jurisdiction pursuant to 28 U.S.C. \u00a7 1291. We review de novo the district court\u2019s decision to uphold the Commissioner\u2019s denial of benefits. <em>See Reddick v. Chater, </em>157 F.3d 715, 720 (9th Cir.1998). The Commissioner\u2019s findings may be set aside if they are based on legal error or are unsupported by substantial evidence. <em>See id. </em>We affirm.</p>\n<p id=\"b625-10\">First, we have consistently held that \u201cquestions of credibility ... are functions solely of the Secretary.\u201d <em>Sample v. Schweiker, </em>694 F.2d 639, 642 (9th Cir.1982) (internal quotations and citations omitted); <em>see also Allen v. Heckler, </em>749 F.2d 577, 580 n. 1 (9th Cir.1985). Our review of the record convinces us that the district court properly held that the Administrative Law Judge (\u201cALJ\u201d) provided clear and convincing reasons for finding Hennon \u201cnot entirely credible.\u201d <em>See Reddick, </em>157 F.3d at 722.</p>\n<p id=\"b625-14\">Second, because the treating doctor\u2019s response to Hennon\u2019s attorney\u2019s questionnaire was not supported by her treatment notes, substantial evidence supports the ALJ\u2019s discrediting the questionnaire. <em>See Saelee v. Chater, </em>94 F.3d 520, 522-23 (9th Cir.1996) (per curiam).</p>\n<p id=\"b625-15\">Third, in consideration of the more recent medical evidence, substantial evidence supports the ALJ\u2019s discrediting the limitations found by the two state agency medical examiners. <em>See Magallanes v. Bowen, </em>881 F.2d 747, 750 (9th Cir.1989) (\u201cALJ is responsible for ... resolving conflicts in medical testimony\u201d).</p>\n<p id=\"b625-16\">Finally, the ALJ\u2019s hypothetical posed to the vocational expert properly included only those limitations which were supported by substantial evidence in the record. <em>See id. </em>at 756-57.</p>\n<p id=\"b625-17\">AFFIRMED.</p>\n<footnote label=\"***\">\n<p id=\"b625-19\"> This disposition is not appropriate for publication and may not be cited to or by the courts of this circuit except as may be provided by 9th Cir.
