Six Unknown Named Agents of Federal Bureau of Narcotics, </em>403 U.S. 388, 91 S.Ct. 1999, 29 L.Ed.2d 619 (1971), claiming that prison officials at the federal prison camp in Marion, Illinois violated his constitutional <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"475\">*475</page-number>rights by directing him to walk through a gate designed for vehicular traffic, which caused him to trip and fall, suffering significant injuries. The district court dismissed his complaint as frivolous under 28 U.S.C. \u00a7 1915A, and Jefferson appeals. We affirm.</p>\n<p id=\"b499-5\">Jefferson alleged that in November 1999 a Marion prison guard, defendant Charles Young, was escorting him and a group of other inmates back to the camp. A small gate designed for pedestrian traffic was locked, and so the gate guard, defendant Earl Powell, directed the inmates to walk single-file through a large gate opened to vehicular traffic. While walking through the gate, Jefferson tripped and fell, breaking both of his arms.</p>\n<p id=\"b499-6\">Jefferson brought this suit for $2 million damages against the prison warden, Young, Powell, and another guard who was driving a food service truck through the gate at the time. Had the guards opened the pedestrian gate, Jefferson alleged, \u201cthis accident would have been avoided.\u201d The district court screened Jefferson\u2019s complaint under \u00a7 1915A and found that the facts in the complaint established at most \u201can unfortunate accident,\u201d which would not constitute an Eighth Amendment violation. In particular, the court determined that Jefferson failed to plead facts showing that any of the defendants possessed a culpable mental state. After the court dismissed his complaint, Jefferson filed a document entitled, \u201cPlaintiffs Rebuttle [sic] to Court\u2019s Motion To Dismiss Order,\u201d which reiterated the facts in his complaint but did not add any new allegations regarding the guards\u2019 mental state. The court construed this document as a motion for reconsideration and denied the motion.</p>\n<p id=\"b499-7\">On appeal Jefferson argues essentially that the district court erred in dismissing his case because he pleaded facts sufficient to establish that the guards were \u201cdeliberately indifferent\u201d to the risk of harm posed when inmates are led through a gate designed for vehicles. Jefferson Reply Br. at 3. Jefferson further argues that the district court should have allowed him an opportunity to amend his complaint before dismissing it with prejudice. Jefferson Br. at 6.</p>\n<p id=\"b499-9\">Under \u00a7 1915A(b)(l), a district court is required to dismiss a prisoner\u2019s complaint if it is \u201cfrivolous, malicious, or fails to state a claim upon which relief may be granted.\u201d An action or claim is \u201cfrivolous\u201d if it \u201clacks an arguable basis either in law or in fact.\u201d <em>Neitzke v. Williams, </em>490 U.S. 319, 325, 109 S.Ct. 1827, 104 L.Ed.2d 338 (1989). Jefferson\u2019s complaint was properly dismissed. To state an Eighth Amendment claim, an inmate must show that officials either intended to inflict suffering or acted with deliberate indifference, where the official \u201cknows of and disregards an excessive risk to inmate health or safety.\u201d <em>Mayoral v. Sheahan, </em>245 F.3d 934, 938 (7th Cir.2001) (quoting <em>Farmer v. Brennan, </em>511 U.S. 825, 837, 114 S.Ct. 1970, 128 L.Ed.2d 811 (1994)). Allegations of negligence by prison officials do not state an Eighth Amendment claim. <em>Estelle v. Gamble, </em>429 U.S. 97, 104-105, 97 S.Ct. 285, 50 L.Ed.2d 251 (1976). Jefferson has not pleaded any facts to suggest that his injury, while unfortunate, was anything more than an accident.</p>\n<p id=\"b499-10\">Throughout his complaint and appellate briefs, Jefferson repeatedly characterizes his injury as an \u201caccident\u201d or \u201cmishap\u201d caused by the guards\u2019 \u201cnegligence.\u201d By alleging facts that clearly show negligence rather than an Eighth Amendment violation, Jefferson has in effect pleaded himself out of court. <em>See Thomas v. Farley, </em>31 F.3d 557, 558-59 (7th Cir.1994) (inmate claiming Eighth Amendment violation who alleged facts establishing only \u201ccareless mistake\u201d by prison officials pleaded him<page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"476\">*476</page-number>self out of court). Nor can Jefferson save his complaint now by asserting legal conclusions in his appellate briefs that the guards were \u201cdeliberately indifferent\u201d to the \u201csubstantial risk\u201d posed by the gate, when he has already made conflicting factual allegations. <em>See Steidl v. Gramley, </em>151 F.3d 739, 741 (7th Cir.1998) (when factual allegations conflict with legal conclusion that prison officials were deliberately indifferent, factual allegations are decisive).</p>\n<p id=\"b500-4\">Moreover, the district court was not required to give Jefferson an opportunity to amend his complaint because doing so would not have helped him state a meritorious Eighth Amendment claim. <em>See Smith-Bey v. Hospital Adm\u2019r, </em>841 F.2d 751, 758 (7th Cir.1988) (noting that district court should give opportunity to amend if it appears that \u201cthe absence of sufficient facts is simply the result of unskilled pro se pleading,\u201d but dismissal with prejudice under \u00a7 1915 is appropriate where deficiencies in pleading cannot be cured by amendment).</p>\n<p id=\"b500-5\">Accordingly, we AFFIRM the decision of the district court. Because Jefferson filed a frivolous complaint followed by a frivolous appeal, he now has two \u201cstrikes\u201d against him for purposes of \u00a7 1915(g). <em>See Hains v. Washington, </em>131 F.3d 1248, 1250 (7th Cir.1997).</p>\n</opinion>\n</casebody>\n",
