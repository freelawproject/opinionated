On November 12, 1996, Mr. Brown filed a petition for a writ of habeas corpus in federal court pursuant to 28 U.S.C. \u00a7 2254. The district court denied the petition, and Mr. Brown now appeals. We have jurisdiction pursuant to 28 U.S.C. \u00a7\u00a7 1291 and 2253 and, for the reasons stated below, affirm.</p>\n<p id=\"b789-7\">We review de novo the district court\u2019s decision to deny Mr. Brown\u2019s habeas petition. <em>See Lockhart v. Terhune, </em>250 F.3d 1223, 1228 (9th Cir.2001). Because Mr. Brown did not file his petition until November 12, 1996, the Antiterrorism and Effective Death Penalty Act (\u201cAEDPA\u201d) governs his case. Under AEDPA, we may grant habeas relief only if the state court\u2019s decision (1) \u201cwas contrary to, or involved an unreasonable application of, clearly established Federal law, as determined by the Supreme Court of the United States\u201d or (2) \u201cwas based on an unreasonable determination of the facts in light of the evidence presented in the State court proceeding.\u201d 28 U.S.C. \u00a7 2254(d).</p>\n<p id=\"b789-8\">Because the parties are familiar with the factual and procedural history of this case, we need not recount it here. The district court certified four issues for this court\u2019s consideration: (1) whether the trial court erred in admitting evidence that had been procured by a government agent (an informant) who had deliberately elicited from Mr. Brown incriminating information in violation of his Sixth Amendment right to counsel; (2) whether the prosecution improperly asserted in its closing argument that the informant\u2019s testimony need not be proven beyond a reasonable doubt; (3) whether the trial court erred in allowing a police officer to provide opinion testimony as to the crime scene when he was not an expert; and (4) whether the cumulative effect of the various errors was prejudicial.</p>\n<p id=\"b789-13\">As to the first issue, we agree with the California Court of Appeal that a document was admitted in violation of Mr. Brown\u2019s Sixth Amendment right to counsel under <em>Massiah v. United States, </em>377 U.S. 201, 84 S.Ct. 1199, 12 L.Ed.2d 246 (1964), and <em>United States v. Henry, </em>447 U.S. 264, 100 S.Ct. 2183, 65 L.Ed.2d 115 (1980). However, we also agree with the state court that the admission of the document was harmless error because another document conveying similar information was already properly admitted into evidence.</p>\n<p id=\"b789-14\">As to the second issue, any potential prejudice caused by the prosecutor\u2019s misstatement was cured when the trial court correctly informed the jury (immediately after the prosecutor\u2019s misstatement) that \u201cthe instructions will read that [corroboration evidence] doesn\u2019t have to prove <em>the commission of the crime </em>beyond a reasonable doubt.\u201d This statement was correct as a matter of law. <em>See People v. Pearl, </em>211 Cal.App.2d 783, 790, 27 Cal. Rptr. 664 (Cal.Ct.App.1963) (\u201c\u2018It is not necessary that the corroborative evidence prove independently ... that [the defendant] is guilty beyond a reasonable doubt.\u2019 \u201d) (quoting <em>People v. Griffin, </em>98 Cal.App.2d 1, 219 P.2d 519, 533 (Cal.1950)).</p>\n<p id=\"b789-15\">As to the third issue, the California Court of Appeal held that the admis<page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"766\">*766</page-number>sion of the officer\u2019s testimony was error under state law. However, for purposes of habeas review, the question is not whether or not state law was violated but rather whether an error occurred \u201cwhich rendered the trial so arbitrary and fundamentally unfair that it violated due process.\u201d <em>Jammal v. Van de Kamp, </em>926 F.2d 918, 920 (9th Cir.1991). In the instant case, the officer\u2019s opinion testimony did not rise to the level of a due process violation because it did little more than state the obvious: that cut telephone wires, a baked potato silencer, and a dead body suggested more than just a simple burglary.</p>\n<p id=\"b790-4\">Finally, we conclude that the errors discussed above, harmless separately, were not sufficiently prejudicial when taken together to dictate the granting of habeas relief under AEDPA\u2019s stringent standard of review. <em>See </em>28 U.S.C. \u00a7 2254(d).</p>\n<p id=\"b790-5\">Accordingly, we AFFIRM the judgment of the district court.</p>\n<footnote label=\"2\">\n<p id=\"b789-16\">.
