(\u201cDAI\u201d) is a Florida corporation with its principal place <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"48\">*48</page-number>of business in Connecticut, and is the national franchiser of Subway sandwich shops. The appellants are Subway franchisees and citizens of Florida. In 1996, the Florida franchisees and other Subway franchisees commenced a class action litigation in Illinois state court, entitled <em>Hollingsworth v. Hart, </em>Cause No. 96-L-00525, alleging various claims relating to the Subway franchise agreement. Because the franchise agreement contained an arbitration provision, DAI filed a motion to compel arbitration and enjoin the state court action in the District of Connecticut under the Federal Arbitration Act, 9 U.S.C. \u00a7 4 (1994). DAI did not petition to compel arbitration with the Florida franchisees, because there is no diversity jurisdiction between them. The district court granted this motion to compel against the party-franchisees, and entered an injunction</p>\n<p id=\"ArW\">enjoining the Defendant-franchisees, their agents, attorneys, servants and employees, and all other persons in active concert or participation with them, including the Florida franchisees and any unnamed class action plaintiffs, from prosecuting the state court action pending in the Illinois Circuit Court, Madison County, entitled <em>David Hollingsworth, et al. v. Joseph Hart, et al., </em>Cause No. 96-L-000525, until further order of this Court.</p>\n<p id=\"b72-4\"><em>Doctor\u2019s Assocs., Inc. v. Hollingsworth, </em>949 F.Supp. 77, 86 (D.Conn.1996). This Court summarily affirmed.</p>\n<p id=\"b72-5\">In 1998, counsel for the defendant-franchisees and non-parties, David M. Duree, filed two putative class actions on behalf of former and current Subway franchisees against DAI in Illinois State court: <em>Hargett v. Doctor\u2019s Assocs., Inc., </em>Cause No. 98-L-410, and <em>Wolf v. Doctor\u2019s </em>Assocs., <em>Inc., </em>Cause No. 98-L-652. In response, DAI again commenced motions to compel arbitration, under 9 U.S.C. \u00a7 4, in the District of Connecticut, against some of these franchisees, and also moved to enjoin Duree and the franchisees from prosecuting any claims related to franchise agreement disputes. The district court granted DATs motions, and enjoined party franchisees and non-party franchisees from prosecuting any lawsuits against DAI without advance approval of the court. This Court vacated the 1998 injunction in part, holding that the district court exceeded its authority under Fed.R.Civ.P. 65(d)<footnotemark>1</footnotemark> and under the Anti-Injunction Act, 28 U.S.C. \u00a7 2283,<footnotemark>2</footnotemark> by enjoining non-party franchisees \u201cfrom prosecuting lawsuits that do not aid or abet the federal defendants in violating the injunctions entered against them.\u201d <em>Doctor\u2019s Assocs., Inc. v. Reinert &amp; Duree, P.C., </em>191 F.3d 297, 303 (2d Cir. 1999).</p>\n<p id=\"b72-9\">DAI then moved to compel arbitration against most of the non-party franchisees of <em>Reinert &amp; Duree, </em>and also moved for an injunction against prosecution of the <em>Wolf </em>and <em>Hargett </em>actions. The district court again granted DATs petitions and enjoined both defendant-franchisees and non-party franchisees from prosecuting <em>Wolf </em>and <em>Hargett. </em>The non-party franchisees appealed to this Court, and we summarily vacated the injunction in part, concluding that, based in part on Duree\u2019s representation that the complaints in <em>Wolf </em>and <em>Hargett </em>had been amended \u201cto exclude any <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"49\">*49</page-number>current or future defendant-franchisees-whether as named plaintiffs or as members of the proposed classes,\u201d the injunction exceeded the district court\u2019s allowable discretion under both Fed.R.Civ.P. 65 and the Anti-Injunction Act, 28 U.S.C. \u00a7 2283. <em>Doctor\u2019s </em>Assocs., <em>Inc. v. Qasim, </em>No. 99-9434, 225 F.3d 645 (tbl.), 2000 WL 1210868 (2d Cir.2000).</p>\n<p id=\"b73-5\">In the meantime, following our opinion in <em>Reinert &amp; Duree </em>and while <em>Qasim </em>was pending, the non-party appellants in this case filed a series of six motions in the district court, to modify its 1996 <em>Hollingsworth </em>injunction. The Florida franchisees sought permission to amend the Illinois state court <em>Hollingsworth v. Hart </em>action to add DAI as a defendant, to proceed with their individual and personal claims against DAI, and to proceed on behalf of other franchisees who are not subject to the district court\u2019s injunction. Although initially there was some confusion about the effect of this Court\u2019s vacatur of the injunctions in <em>Reinert &amp; Duree </em>and <em>Qasim </em>on the 1996 <em>Hollingsworth </em>injunction, the district court eventually denied the Florida franchisees\u2019 modification motion, and stated that:</p>\n<blockquote id=\"b73-6\">The action pending in Madison County is a consolidated class action with the Florida franchisees serving as putative class representatives. The Florida franchisees seek to amend their claims in said action \u201csolely for the purpose of pursuing their individual and personal claims\u201d and argue that the Court is precluded from enjoining such amendment. It is the finding of this Court, however, that Attorney Duree is attempting to use the Florida franchisees as vehicles for prosecuting the class action. There is no other logical explanation for why he filed six motions seeking permission for them to proceed in the pending lawsuit rather than simply bringing a new, separate lawsuit. Coupled with Duree\u2019s track record for attempting to use nonenjoined parties to advance arguments on behalf of enjoined parties, ... it is necessary to prohibit the Florida franchisees from asserting individual claims in the class action in order to carry out effectively the letter and spirit of the injunctions.</blockquote>\n<p id=\"b73-8\">The Florida franchisees appeal this decision, and argue the district court exceeded its authority under Fed.R.Civ.P. 65(d) and the Anti-Injunction Act, 28 U.S.C. \u00a7 2283, and under this Court\u2019s decisions in <em>Reinert &amp; Duree </em>and <em>Qasim.</em></p>\n<p id=\"b73-9\">We review the district court\u2019s decision to continue to enjoin the non-parties\u2019 participation in the Madison County litigation for an abuse of discretion. <em>See Waldman Publishing Corp. v. Landoll, Inc., </em>43 F.3d 775, 780 (2d Cir.1994).</p>\n<p id=\"b73-10\">We conclude that the district court\u2019s refusal to modify the 1996 <em>Hollingsworth </em>injunction was not an abuse of discretion, in light of this Court\u2019s prior approval of that injunction and the district court\u2019s factual finding that Duree was attempting to circumvent the terms of that injunction by proceeding with the Illinois state court <em>Hollingsworth </em>action. The proposed amendment submitted to the district court in support of the modification motion merely proposed to add DAI as a defendant in the <em>Hollingsworth </em>action (albeit \u201conly with respect to [movants\u2019] personal and individual claims\u201d), but did not seek to exclude any of the enjoined franchisees from the caption or the body of the complaint. The district court\u2019s refusal to modify the injunction to permit this amendment in the Illinois action was within its discretion.</p>\n<p id=\"b73-11\">For the reasons set forth above, the judgment of the district court is AFFIRMED.</p>\n<footnote label=\"1\">\n<p id=\"b72-6\">. Fed.R.Civ.P. 65(d) requires that an injunction be \"binding only on the parties to the action, their officers, agents, servants, employees, and attorneys, and upon those persons in active concert or participation with them who receive actual notice of the order by personal service or otherwise.\"</p>\n</footnote>\n<footnote label=\"2\">\n<p id=\"b72-7\">. The Anti-Injunction Act provides:</p>\n<p id=\"b72-10\">A court of the United States may not grant an injunction to stay proceedings in a State court except as expressly authorized by Act of Congress, or where necessary in aid of its jurisdiction, or to protect or effectuate its judgments.</p>\n<p id=\"b72-11\">28 U.S.C. \u00a7 2283 (1994).</p>\n</footnote>\n</opinion>\n</casebody>\n",
