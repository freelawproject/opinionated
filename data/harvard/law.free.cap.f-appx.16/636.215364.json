Rios seeks federal habeas relief from his state court conviction for the second-degree murder of Dan Lacy (\u201cLacy\u201d), in violation of California Penal Code \u00a7\u00a7 187(a) and 189. Specifically, Rios argues that: (1) his due process rights were violated by the admission of testimony given by his codefendant, Oki Shin, regarding Shin\u2019s motivation for pleading guilty; and (2) his Sixth Amendment rights were violated because he was deprived of the effective assistance of counsel. We affirm.</p>\n<p id=\"ArL\"><page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"637\">*637</page-number>In an information filed on April 13, 1987, Rios and Shin were accused of murdering Lacy with the use of a deadly weapon. Shin subsequently entered a plea of guilty to voluntary manslaughter in exchange for a maximum prison sentence of eleven years and his promise to testify truthfully at Rios\u2019s trial.</p>\n<p id=\"b661-5\">At Rios\u2019s trial, Shin responded to a question asked by defense counsel on cross examination by stating that he felt \u201cpressured\u201d to take the guilty plea. Shin explained that he took the guilty plea because he feared that, if he refused it, Rios would accept the guilty plea and testify against him. On redirect examination, the prosecutor asked Shin what he meant by feeling \u201cpressured\u201d to plead guilty. Shin replied that \u201cI meant if I didn\u2019t take the deal that [defense counsel] ... would be happy to take the deal for Mr. Rios and testify against me.\u201d The trial judge then read to the jury a stipulation agreed to by defense counsel and the prosecutor, which stated that \u201c[a]t no time did the defendant Rios agree to plead guilty to the charge against him or any reduced charge.\u201d The trial judge told the jury that the stipulation was a \u201cconclusively proved\u201d fact, and also instructed the jury that plea discussions occurred \u201cin nearly every criminal case\u201d and that such discussions were \u201cno[t] evidence of the defendant\u2019s guilt.\u201d Finally, the trial judge instructed the jury that it could consider Shin\u2019s testimony regarding his motivation for pleading guilty only as it related to Shin\u2019s credibility.</p>\n<p id=\"b661-6\">Rios argues that the trial judge\u2019s decision to allow Shin to testify regarding his motivation for pleading guilty was error arising to the level of a due process violation. To prevail on this claim, Rios must show that the alleged error had a \u201csubstantial and injurious effect\u201d on the jury\u2019s verdict. <em>Brecht v. Abrahamson, </em>507 U.S. 619, 623, 113 S.Ct. 1710, 123 L.Ed.2d 353 (1993). Because Rios\u2019s habeas appeal is governed by the standard set forth in the Antiterrorism and Effective Death Penalty Act of 1996 (\u201cAEDPA\u201d), Rios must also show that the state court\u2019s rejection of this claim \u201cresulted in a decision that was contrary to, or involved an unreasonable application of, clearly established Federal law, as determined by the Supreme Court of the United States.\u201d 28 U.S.C. \u00a7 2254(d)(1). Because we find that no error occurred that had a \u201csubstantial and injurious effect\u201d on the jury\u2019s verdict, we conclude that the state court\u2019s decision was not \u201cunreasonable\u201d under AEDPA</p>\n<p id=\"b661-8\">Even assuming that the trial judge erred in permitting Shin to testify on redirect regarding his motivation for pleading guilty, Rios cannot show that the error prejudiced his right to a fair trial. The jury was not told that Rios had, in fact, pleaded guilty to the charged crime at an earlier date. Nor was the jury told that it could consider Shin\u2019s testimony regarding Rios\u2019s purported interest in pleading guilty as evidence of Rios\u2019s guilt. <em>Cf. Standen v. Whitley, </em>994 F.2d 1417, 1422-23 (9th Cir. 1993) (holding that defendant\u2019s due process rights were violated because the jury was told to consider prior withdrawn guilty plea as evidence of guilt). To the contrary, the trial judge specifically instructed the jury that Shin\u2019s testimony could be considered only as it related to Shin\u2019s credibility. This instruction cured the prejudicial impact, if any, that Shin\u2019s testimony may have had. <em>Richardson v. Marsh, </em>481 U.S. 200, 206, 107 S.Ct. 1702, 95 L.Ed.2d 176 (1987) (stating that there is an \u201calmost invariable assumption of the law that jurors follow their instructions\u201d).</p>\n<p id=\"b661-9\">Rios also argues that he is entitled to habeas relief based on the ineffective assistance of trial counsel. To prevail on this claim, Rios must show that counsel\u2019s errors constituted deficient representation that prejudiced the outcome of the trial. <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"638\">*638</page-number><em>Strickland v. Washington, </em>466 U.S. 668, 687, 104 S.Ct. 2052, 80 L.Ed.2d 674 (1984). The state court applied <em>Strickland </em>in analyzing Rios\u2019s ineffective assistance of counsel claim, and the Supreme Court has held that <em>Strickland </em>is \u201cclearly established law\u201d for A.EDPA purposes, <em>Williams v. Taylor, </em>529 U.S. 362, 390-91, 120 S.Ct. 1495, 146 L.Ed.2d 389 (2000). Thus, to obtain habeas relief, Rios must show that the state court\u2019s denial of his claim resulted in a decision involving \u201can unreasonable application of\u2019 <em>Strickland. 28 </em>U.S.C. \u00a7 2254(d)(1). None of the errors alleged by Rios, either separately or cumulatively, amount to deficient performance by trial counsel \u2014 much less prejudiced the outcome of the trial. Therefore, we conclude that the state court\u2019s decision was not \u201cunreasonable\u201d under AEDPA.</p>\n<p id=\"b662-4\">The district court\u2019s order denying Rios\u2019s habeas petition is AFFIRMED.</p>\n<footnote label=\"*\">\n<p id=\"b660-15\"> This disposition is not appropriate for publication and may not be cited to or by the courts of this circuit except as may be provided by 9 th Cir.
