(\u201cOtoM\u201d) appeals from the district court\u2019s order dismissing its complaint for failure to comply with a court order. OtoM argues on appeal that the district court erred in not remanding its case to the Commonwealth court in Puerto Rico, because the court lacked subject-matter jurisdiction over its case. OtoM further argues that the district court abused its discretion in dismissing the complaint.</p>\n<p id=\"b27-19\">A district court has inherent authority to manage its docket and may impose sanctions when it finds that its process has been abused even in the absence of subject matter jurisdiction. <em>Cf. Unanue-Casal v. Unanue-Casal, </em>898 F.2d 839, 841 (1st Cir. 1990) (imposing Fed.R.Civ.P. 11 sanctions after dismissing a petition for removal to federal court). Thus, we decline to decide whether the district court had subject-matter jurisdiction, because, in the present circumstances where appellant has not shown that filing a new action in Commonwealth court is barred by the statute of limitations, <em>see </em>31 P.R. Laws Ann. \u00a7 5303, we conclude that the district court did not abuse its discretion in dismissing OtoM\u2019s complaint without prejudice as a sanction for OtoM\u2019s failure to comply with the district court\u2019s order that OtoM file a status report. <em>See John\u2019s Insulation, Inc. v. L. Addison and Associates, Inc., </em>156 F.3d 101, 108 (1st Cir.1998). Accordingly, appellant\u2019s motion requesting adjudication on its brief without oral argument, pursuant to Fed.R.App.P. 34(f) is <em>granted </em>and the judgment of the district court is <em>affirmed.</em></p>\n</opinion>\n</casebody>\n",
