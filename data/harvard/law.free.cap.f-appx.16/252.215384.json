For the reasons that follow, we affirm his conviction and sentence.</p>\n<p id=\"b277-9\">First, we find no violation of the Speedy Trial Act. <em>United States v. Taylor, </em>240 F.3d 425, 427 (4th Cir.2001). Second, we do not find that Martinez\u2019s enhanced sentence violates the prohibition against the passage of ex post facto laws. <em>United States v. Forbes, </em>16 F.3d 1294, 1301-02 (1st Cir.1994). Next, the fact that Martinez\u2019s Texas burglary conviction was set aside following his successful completion of a term of probation does not alter the fact that such conviction was a proper \u201caggravated felony\" predicate for a sentence enhancement under \u00a7 1326(b)(2). <em>United States v. Campbell, </em>167 F.3d 94, 98 (2d Cir.1999). Finally, we decline Martinez\u2019s invitation to interpret the Supreme Court\u2019s opinion in <em>Apprendi v. New Jersey, </em>530 U.S. 466, 120 S.Ct. 2348, 147 L.Ed.2d 435 (2000), as overruling its earlier opinion in <em>Almendarez-Torres v. United States, </em>523 U.S. 224, 118 S.Ct. 1219, 140 L.Ed.2d 350 (1998).</p>\n<p id=\"b277-10\">Accordingly, we affirm Martinez\u2019s conviction and sentence. We dispense \"with oral argument because the facts and legal contentions are adequately presented in the materials before the court and argument would not aid the decisional process.</p>\n<p id=\"b277-12\">\n<em>AFFIRMED.</em>\n</p>\n</opinion>\n</casebody>\n",
