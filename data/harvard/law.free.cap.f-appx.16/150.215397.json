We have reviewed the record and the district court\u2019s order regarding excusable neglect and find no abuse of discretion. <em>United States v. Breit, </em>754 F.2d 526, 529 (4th Cir.1985) (stating standard of review). Accordingly, we affirm the excusable neglect determination on the reasoning of the district court. <em>United States v. Monroe, </em>No. CR-94-41 (W.D.Va. Oct. 10, 2000).</p>\n<p id=\"b175-5\">With regard to Monroe\u2019s appeal from the order denying his \u00a7 3582 motion, we dismiss the appeal for lack of jurisdiction. In criminal cases, the defendant must file his notice of appeal within ten days of the entry of judgment. Fed.R.App. P. 4(b)(1)(A). With or without a motion, the district court may grant an extension of time to file of up to thirty days upon a showing of excusable neglect. Fed. R.App. P. 4(b)(4); <em>United States v. Alvarez, </em>210 F.3d 309, 310 (5th Cir.2000) (holding that \u00a7 3582 proceeding is criminal in nature and ten-day appeal period applies); <em>United States v. Reyes, </em>759 F.2d 351, 353 (4th Cir.1985). This appeal period is \u201cmandatory and jurisdictional.\u201d <em>Browder v. Director, Dep\u2019t of Corrections, </em>434 U.S. 257, 264, 98 S.Ct. 556, 54 L.Ed.2d 521 (1978) (quoting <em>United States v. Robinson, </em>361 U.S. 220, 229, 80 S.Ct. 282, 4 L.Ed.2d 259 (1960)); <em>United States v. Raynor, </em>939 F.2d 191, 197 (4th Cir.1991).</p>\n<p id=\"b175-6\">The district court\u2019s order was entered on the docket on March 25, 1999. Monroe\u2019s notice of appeal was filed nunc pro tunc on May 14, 2000. Because Monroe failed to file a timely notice of appeal, to obtain an extension based upon excusable neglect, or to obtain a reopening of the appeal period, we deny leave to proceed in forma pauperis and dismiss this portion of the appeal. We dispense with oral argument because the facts and legal contentions are adequately presented in the materials before the court and argument would not aid the decisional process.</p>\n<p id=\"b175-10\">\n<em>AFFIRMED IN PART AND DISMISSED IN PART.</em>\n</p>\n<footnote label=\"*\">\n<p id=\"b175-7\"> To the extent that Monroe seeks to appeal the district court\u2019s order entered on April 14, 2000, which denied his co-defendant's \u00a7 3582 motion, we dismiss the appeal.</p>\n</footnote>\n</opinion>\n</casebody>\n",
