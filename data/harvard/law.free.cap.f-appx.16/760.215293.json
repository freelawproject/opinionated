His victim was his estranged wife, Juana. The district court granted a certificate of appealability as to whether Chavez\u2019s trial counsel rendered ineffective assistance. <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"762\">*762</page-number>We have jurisdiction pursuant to 28 U.S.C. \u00a7\u00a7 2253 <em>&amp; </em>2254, and we affirm.</p>\n<p id=\"b786-4\">Chavez contends that counsel erred by failing to make Juana\u2019s audio-taped police interview, or a transcript of it, part of the trial record for appeal. Because Chavez has not identified or explained anything on the tape that would have persuaded the state court to reverse his convictions, he has not established the requisite prejudice. <em>See Strickland v. Washington, </em>466 U.S. 668, 694, 697, 104 S.Ct. 2052, 80 L.Ed.2d 674 (1984); <em>Villafuerte v. Stewart, </em>111 F.3d 616, 629-30, 631 (9th Cir.1997) (per curiam).</p>\n<p id=\"b786-5\">Chavez next alleges that counsel was ineffective for deciding not to recall expert witness Dr. Hurley to the stand to answer a specific hypothetical question. Counsel\u2019s performance was not deficient because he made a tactical decision to call another, more qualified expert to testify to the same information. <em>See Furman v. Wood, </em>190 F.3d 1002, 1007 (9th Cir.1999) (\u201cCounsel\u2019s tactical decisions are \u2018virtually unchallengeable.\u2019 \u201d) <em>(quoting Strickland, </em>466 U.S. at 690, 104 S.Ct. 2052).</p>\n<p id=\"b786-6\">Chavez claims that prejudice resulted from counsel\u2019s use of the word \u201ctorture\u201d during his cross-examination of Juana. Counsel\u2019s comments were intended to show sympathy and respect for Juana in order to avoid further hostility to Chavez and his counsel. The comments did not concede Chavez\u2019s guilt in any way. Chavez has not demonstrated either deficient performance or prejudice. <em>See Strickland, </em>466 U.S. at 694, 104 S.Ct. 2052.</p>\n<p id=\"b786-7\">Chavez also takes issue with counsel\u2019s failure to move to strike Juana\u2019s testimony that Chavez spent time in jail. Counsel\u2019s strategic decision to clarify that Chavez was briefly in jail for an innocuous reason does not constitute deficient performance. <em>See id. </em>at 690, 104 S.Ct. 2052.</p>\n<p id=\"b786-8\">At one point during the trial, Juror No. 9 sent a note to the trial judge clarifying a defense witness\u2019 Spanish-to-English translation. Chavez contends he suffered prejudice from counsel\u2019s failure to act on the note, either by seeking a mistrial or asking the court to remove that juror. His contention fails because he has not established that such a challenge would have been successful, <em>see Kimmelman v. Morrisson, </em>477 U.S. 365, 374-75, 106 S.Ct. 2574, 91 L.Ed.2d 305 (1986), nor that counsel\u2019s failure to object to Juror No. 9\u2019s presence on the jury resulted in actual prejudice, <em>see Strickland, </em>466 U.S. at 694, 104 S.Ct. 2052; <em>Anderson v. Calderon, </em>232 F.3d 1053, 1098-99 (9th Cir.2000); <em>Rodriguez v. Marshall, </em>125 F.3d 739, 745-47 (9th Cir.1997).</p>\n<p id=\"b786-9\">Finally, Chavez argues that counsel\u2019s cumulative errors warrant habeas relief. There are no constitutional errors to accumulate. <em>See Villafuerte, </em>111 F.3d at 632.</p>\n<p id=\"b786-10\">AFFIRMED.</p>\n<footnote label=\"***\">\n<p id=\"b785-22\"> This disposition is not appropriate for publication Bind may not be cited to or by the courts of this circuit except as may be provided by 9th Cir.
