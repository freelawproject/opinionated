Campitelli appeals district court\u2019s order denying her motion for default judgment against several unserved parties in this civil action. We dismiss the appeal for lack of jurisdiction because the order is not appealable. This court may exercise jurisdiction only over final orders, 28 U.S.C. \u00a7 1291 (1994), and certain interlocutory and collateral orders, 28 U.S.C. \u00a7 1292 (1994); Fed.R.Civ.P. 54(b); <em>Cohen v. Beneficial Indus. Loan Corp., </em>337 U.S. 541, 69 S.Ct. 1221, 93 L.Ed. 1528 (1949). The order here appealed is neither a final order nor an appealable interlocutory or collateral order.</p>\n<p id=\"b221-11\">We deny leave to proceed in forma pauperis and dismiss the appeal as interlocutory. Campitelh\u2019s pending motions for stay or for temporary restraining orders are denied. The motion for abeyance is denied and the motion to expedite this appeal is denied as moot. We decline to order production of transcripts at the government\u2019s expense and decline to issue a writ of mandamus. We find no grounds for the suspension or disbarment of Maryland Attorney General J. Joseph Curran, Jr., or any of the members of his staff. Campitelli\u2019s motion seeking suspension or disbarment is therefore denied. Appellees\u2019 motion to dismiss is granted. We dispense with oral argument because the facts and legal contentions are adequately presented in the materials before the court and argument would not aid the decisional process.</p>\n<p id=\"b221-13\">\n<em>DISMISSED.</em>\n</p>\n</opinion>\n</casebody>\n",
