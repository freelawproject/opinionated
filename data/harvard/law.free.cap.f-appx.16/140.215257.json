She also told Ratner that she inadvertently had brought a knife to school in her binder that morning. Ratner had known her for two years, was aware of her previous suicide attempts, and feared for her safety. Thus, he took the binder from her and put it in his locker. He did not tell school authorities about the knife, but he intended to tell both his and her parents after school.</p>\n<p id=\"b165-17\">By lunchtime that day, Roberta Griffith, Assistant Principal at the school, had learned that the girl might have given a knife to Ratner.</p>\n<p id=\"b165-18\">Eventually, Fanny Kellogg, Dean at the school, summoned Ratner to her office and asked him about the knife. Ratner admitted that he had it, and at Kellogg\u2019s direction he went alone to his locker, retrieved the binder, and gave it to Kellogg. Kellogg acknowledged that she believed Ratner acted in what he saw as the girl\u2019s best interest and that at no time did Ratner pose a threat to harm anyone with the knife.</p>\n<p id=\"b165-19\">Nonetheless, Ratner was then suspended by Griffith for 10 days for possessing a knife on school grounds in violation of school board policy. Four days later, the school\u2019s principal, Joseph Mauck, affirmed Ratner\u2019s suspension with written notice. Two days after that, Edgar Hatrick, Division Superintendent for the Loudoun County Public Schools, issued written notice informing Ratner that he was being suspended indefinitely pending further action by the school board, and informing Ratner that Hatrick was recommending to an administrative hearing panel that Ratner be suspended for the remainder of the <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"142\">*142</page-number>school term, which ended February 1, 2000. The administrative hearing panel met on October 29, 1999, and recommended Ratner be suspended for the remainder of the term, and Hatrick then gave Ratner written notice of his long-term suspension. Ratner\u2019s mother, Beth Haney, requested and received a hearing before the school district\u2019s Discipline Committee to appeal, but that committee unanimously approved Ratner\u2019s long-term suspension.</p>\n<p id=\"b166-4\">Ratner, through his mother, filed suit against the school district and four of its employees under 42 U.S.C. \u00a7 1983. Ratner\u2019s complaint asserted that his suspension under what is called a zero tolerance policy<footnotemark>2</footnotemark> amounted to violations of Ratner\u2019s Fourteenth Amendment rights to due process and equal protection and his Eighth Amendment right to be free from cruel and unusual punishment, and asserted several other causes of action, and sought compensatory and punitive damages, fees and costs, and other relief.</p>\n<p id=\"b166-5\">The district court dismissed Ratner\u2019s complaint for failure to state a claim under Fed.R.Civ.P. 12(b)(6). We review <em>de novo </em>a district court\u2019s decision to dismiss a case for failure to state a claim. <em>Mayes v. Rapoport, </em>198 F.3d 457, 460 (4th Cir.1999). In reviewing a 12(b)(6) dismissal, we construe factual allegations in the nonmoving party\u2019s favor, treating them as true, and we will affirm a dismissal for failure to state a claim only if it appears that the plaintiffs would not be entitled to relief under any facts which could be proved in support of their claims. <em>Mayes, </em>198 F.3d at 460 (quotations and citations omitted). Having heard oral argument and considering the briefs and the record, we find no reversible error, and we affirm substantially for the same reasons expressed by the district court in its opinion, <em>Ratner v. Loudoun County Pub. Sch., </em>Civ. No. 00-944-A (E.D.Va. July 28, 2000).</p>\n<p id=\"b166-8\">In its memorandum opinion, the district court concluded Ratner\u2019s claim was, in essence, a claim of due process violations. The district court also concluded, correctly, that the school officials gave Ratner constitutionally sufficient, even if imperfect, process in the various notices and hearings it accorded him, and we agree. See <em>Goss v. Lopez, </em>419 U.S. 565, 581, 95 S.Ct. 729, 42 L.Ed.2d 725 (1975) (describing process due students in connection with suspensions from school).</p>\n<p id=\"b166-9\">However harsh the result in this case, the federal courts are not properly called upon to judge the wisdom of a zero tolerance policy of the sort alleged to be in place at Blue Ridge Middle School or of its application to Ratner. Instead, our inquiry here is limited to whether Ratner\u2019s complaint alleges sufficient facts which if proved would show that the implementation of the school\u2019s policy in this case failed to comport with the United States Constitution. We conclude that the facts alleged in this case do not so demonstrate.</p>\n<p id=\"b166-10\">The judgment of the district court is accordingly</p>\n<p id=\"b166-11\">\n<em>AFFIRMED.</em>\n</p>\n<footnote label=\"1\">\n<p id=\"b165-15\">. Our recitation of the facts of this case are those found in Rainer\u2019s complaint, which we accept as true for the purposes of this appeal. <em>Mayes v. Rapoport, </em>198 F.3d 457, 460 (4th Cir. 1999).</p>\n</footnote>\n<footnote label=\"2\">\n<p id=\"b166-6\"><em>. </em>Ratner's complaint asserts that the school employs a zero tolerance policy regarding weapons, a policy that precludes officials from considering the circumstances of a particular case when meting out punishment. Although we accept Ratner\u2019s assertion as true for the purposes of this appeal, we note that his brief\u2019s recitation of the school\u2019s policies indicates that possession of a weapon on school grounds would not necessarily result in long-term suspension. Instead, as recited by Ratner, board policy in such cases apparently begins with a presumption that offending students will be expelled (permanently removed) but allows school officials discretion to subject offending students \u201cto such lesser disciplinary action, including long-term suspension [suspension for one or two semesters], as may be deemed appropriate.\u201d</p>\n</footnote>\n</opinion>\n<opinion data-order=\"9\" data-type=\"opinion\" id=\"x999-2\" type=\"concurrence\">\n<author id=\"b167-4\"><page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"143\">*143</page-number>HAMILTON, Senior Circuit Judge,</author>\n<p id=\"ARt\">concurring:</p>\n<p id=\"b167-5\">On appeal, Ratner challenges the district court\u2019s dismissal of three federal constitutional claims alleged in his complaint: (1) a procedural due process claim under the Fourteenth Amendment; (2) an equal protection claim under the Fourteenth Amendment; and (3) a cruel and unusual punishment claim under the Eighth Amendment. U.S. Const, amend. VIII, XIV, \u00a7 1. After accepting all well-pleaded allegations in Ratner\u2019s complaint as true and drawing all reasonable factual inferences from those facts in his favor, it appears certain that he cannot prove any set of facts which would entitle him to relief on any of the three claims asserted. Accordingly, the opinion for the court correctly affirms the district court\u2019s Rule 12(b)(6) dismissal of Ratner\u2019s claims, and I am constrained to concur in that opinion. <em>Edwards v. City of Goldsboro, </em>178 F.3d 231, 244 (4th Cir.1999) (\u201c[A] Rule 12(b)(6) motion should only be granted if, after accepting all well-pleaded allegations in the plaintiffs complaint as true and drawing all reasonable factual inferences from those facts in the plaintiffs favor, it appears certain that the plaintiff cannot prove any set of facts in support of his claim entitling him to relief.\u201d).</p>\n<p id=\"b167-6\">I write separately to express my compassion for Ratner, his family, and common sense. Each is the victim of good intentions run amuck. Ratner\u2019s complaint alleges that school suspensions for possession of a weapon on Loudoun County school property are imposed automatically, pursuant to a zero-tolerance policy that precludes consideration of the facts and circumstances of a particular student\u2019s conduct in determining a violation of stated policy and the resulting student punishment. There is no doubt that this zero-tolerance/automatic suspension policy, and others like it adopted by school officials throughout our nation, were adopted in large response to the tragic school shootings that have plagued our nation\u2019s schools over the past several years. Also, no doubt exists that in adopting these zero-tolerance/automatic suspension policies, school officials had the noble intention of protecting the health and safety of our nation\u2019s school children and those adults charged with the profound responsibility of educating them. However, as the oft repeated old English maxim recognizes, \u201cthe road to hell is paved with good intentions.\u201d The panic over school violence and the intent to stop it has caused school officials to jettison the common sense idea that a person\u2019s punishment should fit his crime in favor of a single harsh punishment, namely, mandatory school suspension. Such a policy has stripped away judgment and discretion on the part of those administering it; refuting the well established precept that judgment is the better part of wisdom.</p>\n<p id=\"b167-8\">Here, a young man, Ratner, took a binder containing a knife from a suicidal fellow student in an effort to save her life. He put the binder in his locker without even opening it. Indeed, at all times, Ratner never saw the knife. Further, the facts do not offer even the hint of a suggestion that Ratner ever intended to personally possess the knife or harm anyone with it. In fact, the first school official on the scene reported that at no time did Ratner intend to harm anyone with the knife. Yet, based on the school\u2019s zero-tolerance/automatic suspension policy, Ratner was suspended from school for nearly four months.</p>\n<p id=\"b167-9\">School officials should, without doubt, punish a student for knowingly and intentionally bringing a dangerous weapon on school property. But the question raised by the facts of Ratner\u2019s case is one of degree and the law must be flexible <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"144\">*144</page-number>enough so that school officials may intrude upon the right to a free appropriate public education <em>only </em>in the most justifiable circumstances. <em>See Goss v. Lopez, </em>419 U.S. 565, 573-74, 95 S.Ct. 729, 42 L.Ed.2d 725 (1975) (holding that property interest in public education is created when state maintains a public school system and requires children to attend). Under a facts/circumstances-sensitive examination of this case, Ratner\u2019s nearly four-month suspension from middle school is not justifiable. Indeed, it is a calculated overkill when the punishment is considered in light of Ratner\u2019s good-faith intentions and his, at best, if at all, technical violation of the school\u2019s policy. Suffice it to say that the degree of Ratner\u2019s violation of school policy does not correlate with the degree of his punishment. Certainly, the oft repeated maxim, \u201cthere is no justice without mercy\u201d has been defiled by the results obtained here. But alas, as the opinion for the court explains, this is not a federal constitutional problem.</p>\n</opinion>\n</casebody>\n",
