Kamara-Reid received a sentence of four months imprisonment <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"161\">*161</page-number>based upon an undisputed guideline range of four to ten months.</p>\n<p id=\"b185-5\">Kamara-Reid first contends that the district court erred in denying her pretrial motion to suppress a photocopy of the counterfeit green card that she gave her employer. She argues that the Immigration and Naturalization Service (INS) regulation providing for a warrantless inspection of the employer\u2019s immigration records violates the Fourth Amendment and that the promulgation of such regulation exceeded the INS\u2019s authority. She also insists that the search was pretextual.</p>\n<p id=\"b185-6\">Kamara-Reid presented no evidence at the suppression hearing indicating a legitimate privacy interest in her employer\u2019s copy of her counterfeit green card. She did not establish where her employer kept the copy, who had access to it, or whether Kamara Reid herself had access to enable her to remove it from her employer\u2019s records. Moreover, the rationale for the employer\u2019s collection of these immigration records is compliance with INS requirements and for INS inspection; thus, Kamara-Reid should have been aware that the documents were likely to be reviewed by the INS during her employment tenure. <em>Cf. United States v. Amon, </em>669 F.2d 1351 (10th Cir.1981) (\u201cIt is also clear that defendants\u2019 Fourth Amendment rights have not been violated by the Government since they could not legitimately claim an expectation of privacy in documents which they submitted voluntarily to the IRS and their employers.\u201d). Thus, we conclude that Kamara-Reid is not entitled to advance her Fourth Amendment challenges because she has not established a legitimate expectation of privacy in the area searched or the item seized. <em>Rakas v. Illinois, </em>439 U.S. 128, 143, 148-49, 99 S.Ct. 421, 58 L.Ed.2d 387 (1978); <em>see Minnesota v. Olson, </em>495 U.S. 91, 95-96, 110 S.Ct. 1684, 109 L.Ed.2d 85 (1990); <em>Rawlings v. Kentucky, </em>448 U.S. 98, 104, 100 S.Ct. 2556, 65 L.Ed.2d 633 (1980).</p>\n<p id=\"b185-8\">Kamara-Reid next claims that the district court erred in declining to grant her motion for a downward departure based upon her status as a deportable alien. Where the district court recognizes that it has the authority to grant a motion for downward departure, its refusal to do so is not reviewable. <em>United States v.. Matthews, </em>209 F.3d 338, 352-53 (4th Cir.), <em>cert. denied, </em>531 U.S. 910, 121 S.Ct. 260, 148 L.Ed.2d 188 (2000). Here, although the district court arguably indicated that it lacked authority to depart on the basis sought by Kamara-Reid, it also stated that even if it had the authority, it would not have departed in Kamara-Reid\u2019s case. Because the district court made this alternative finding, we are without jurisdiction to review the district court\u2019s refusal to depart. <em>See United States v. Acevedo, </em>229 F.3d 350, 356 (2d Cir.2000). Therefore, we dismiss this claim for lack of jurisdiction.</p>\n<p id=\"b185-9\">Accordingly, we affirm Kamara-Reid\u2019s conviction and sentence. We dispense with oral argument because the facts and legal contentions are adequately presented in the materials before the Court and argument would not aid the decisional process. *</p>\n<p id=\"b185-10\">\n<em>AFFIRMED.</em>\n</p>\n</opinion>\n</casebody>\n",
