We have jurisdiction pursuant to 28 U.S.C. \u00a7 1291, and we affirm.</p>\n<p id=\"b712-14\">Bensimon contends that his conviction should be reversed because the prosecutor made improperly prejudicial comments during closing argument. We reject the contention. Most of the comments about which Bensimon complains were either proper responses to arguments made by Bensimon\u2019s trial counsel, <em>United States v. Young, </em>470 U.S. 1, 12-13, 105 S.Ct. 1038, 84 L.Ed.2d 1 (1985), legitimate challenges to Bensimon\u2019s failure to explain damaging inferences from the Government\u2019s evidence, <em>United States v. Mares, </em>940 F.2d 455, 461 (9th Cir. 1991), or reasonable inferences from the evidence presented at trial, <em>United States v. Bracy, </em>67 F.3d 1421, 1431 (9th Cir. 1995). Even though a few of the prosecutor\u2019s comments crossed the boundaries of propriety, the record fails to reflect prejudice that would warrant invalidating the conviction. <em>United States v. Cooper, </em>173 F.3d 1192, 1203 (9th Cir.1999); <em>see United States v. Yarbrough, </em>852 F.2d 1522, 1539 (9th Cir.1988) (noting that \u201c[ejvery slight excess of a prosecutor does not require\u201d reversal).</p>\n<p id=\"b712-15\">Bensimon also argues that the district court violated the Supreme Court\u2019s decision in <em>Apprendi v. New Jersey, </em>530 U.S. 466, 120 S.Ct. 2348, 147 L.Ed.2d 435 (2000), by failing to require the jury to determine the amount of cocaine involved <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"689\">*689</page-number>in Bensimon\u2019s offense. However, Bensimon stipulated that his offense involved more than five kilograms, an amount for which the statutory maximum exceeds the sentence Bensimon received. <em>United States v. Saya, </em>247 F.3d 929, 942 (9th Cir.2001); <em>see United States v. Houston, </em>547 F.2d 104, 107 (9th Cir.1976) (discussing the binding effect of stipulations). Moreover, Bensimon agreed to the stipulation in order to prevent the Government from submitting the issue of drug quantity to the jury. <em>United States v. Cabrera, </em>201 F.3d 1243, 1249 (9th Cir.2000) (stating that \u201can error that is caused by the actions of the complaining party will cause reversal only in the most exceptional situation\u201d). There was no <em>Apprendi </em>error.</p>\n<p id=\"b713-5\">Bensimon contends that the district court improperly denied his motions to suppress evidence and to dismiss the indictment. The district court properly rejected the motion to suppress. It was brought during trial and was therefore untimely. <em>United States v. Wright, </em>215 F.3d 1020, 1026 (9th Cir.), <em>cert. denied, </em>\u2014 U.S.-, 121 S.Ct. 406, 148 L.Ed.2d 313 (2000). The district court also properly rejected Bensimon\u2019s motion to dismiss because it was based on the same alleged Fourth Amendment violation as his motion to suppress. Suppression, which Bensimon waived, is the proper remedy for such a violation; dismissal of the indictment is not. <em>United States v. Morrison, </em>449 U.S. 361, 366, 101 S.Ct. 665, 66 L.Ed.2d 564 (1981); <em>United States v. Haynes, </em>216 F.3d 789, 796-97 (9th Cir.2000).</p>\n<p id=\"b713-8\">Bensimon next argues that the district court improperly allowed expert testimony as to Bensimon\u2019s mental state, in violation of Fed.R.Evid. 704(b). There was no violation of Rule 704(b). The expert\u2019s testimony as a whole did not speak to Bensimon\u2019s particular state of mind, but rather provided generalizations about drug smuggling organizations from which the jury could have inferred that Bensimon had knowledge of the cocaine at issue. <em>See United States v. Morales, </em>108 F.3d 1031, 1041 (9th Cir.1997). In one instance the Government\u2019s expert provided testimony that arguably came close to violating Rule 704(b), but that testimony was a reasonably responsive answer to a question posed by defense counsel on re-cross examination. The district court did not plainly err by failing to intervene, <em>sua sponte, </em>in defense counsel\u2019s examination. <em>United States v. Alatorre, </em>222 F.3d 1098, 1100 (9th Cir.2000); <em>Cabrera, </em>201 F.3d at 1249.</p>\n<p id=\"b713-10\">Bensimon also contends that the district court erred by adjusting his sentence upward for playing an aggravated role in the offense, pursuant to U.S.S.G. \u00a7 3Bl.l(c). This contention lacks merit. Record evidence, if believed, supported a reasonable inference that Bensimon directed the efforts of one co-participant and had a significant role in organizing the importation of a large narcotics shipment. <em>United States v. Garcia-Guizar, </em>227 F.3d 1125, 1132 (9th Cir.2000) (affirming imposition of section 3B1.1(c) adjustment where evidence permitted reasonable inference that the defendant was in charge of criminal operation, at least with respect to one other participant); U.S.S.G. \u00a7 3B1.1, comment. (n.2) (stating that subsection (c) upward adjustment may be warranted where defendant did not control other participants, but \u201cexercised management responsibility over the property, assets, or activities of a criminal organization\u201d).</p>\n<p id=\"b713-11\">Finally, Bensimon argues that the district court improperly refused his request for a downward adjustment for playing a minor role in the offense, pursuant to U.S.S.G. \u00a7 3B1.2(b). We reject the contention. The evidence supported a reasonable inference that Bensimon directed the efforts of one co-participant and had a <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"690\">*690</page-number>significant role in organizing the offense. <em>United States v. Otis, </em>127 F.3d 829, 836 (9th Cir.1997) (per curiam) (adjustment properly denied based on district court\u2019s determination that defendant\u2019s involvement in the offense was \u201cmore than a cameo appearance\u201d and \u201cindicates a deeper involvement than simply a passing, innocent participant recruited for one single event\u201d).</p>\n<p id=\"b714-4\">AFFIRMED.</p>\n<footnote label=\"*\">\n<p id=\"b712-11\"> This disposition is not appropriate for publication and may not be cited to or by the courts of this circuit except as may be provided by 9th Cir.
