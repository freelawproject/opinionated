We dismiss the appeal for lack of jurisdiction because Ellison\u2019s notice of appeal was not timely filed.</p>\n<p id=\"b250-21\">Parties are accorded thirty days after the entry of the district court\u2019s final judgment or order to note an appeal, <em>see </em>Fed. R.App. P. 4(a)(1), unless the district court extends the appeal period under Fed. R.App. P. 4(a)(5) or reopens the appeal period under Fed. R.App. P. 4(a)(6). This appeal period is mandatory and jurisdictional. <em>Browder v. Director, Dep\u2019t of Corrections, </em>434 U.S. 257, 264, 98 S.Ct. 556, 54 L.Ed.2d 521 (1978) (quoting <em>United States v. Robinson, </em>361 U.S. 220, 229, 80 S.Ct. 282, 4 L.Ed.2d 259 (1960)).</p>\n<p id=\"b250-22\">The district court\u2019s order denying Ellison\u2019s \u00a7 2254 petition was entered on the docket on September 27, 2000. Ellison filed a motion to alter or amend the judgment not later than ten days after entry of judgment which tolled the appeal period. <em>See </em>Fed. R.App. P. 4(a)(4)(A). The district court order denying Ellison\u2019s motion to alter or amend was entered on the docket October 20, 2000. Ellison filed a notice of appeal March 20, 2001.</p>\n<p id=\"b251-4\"><page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"227\">*227</page-number>Because Ellison failed to file a timely notice of appeal or to obtain an extension or reopening of the appeal period, we grant leave to proceed in forma pauperis, deny a certificate of appealability, deny his motion to consolidate, and dismiss the appeal.<footnotemark>*</footnotemark> We dispense with oral argument because the facts and legal contentions are adequately presented in the materials before the court and argument would not aid the decisional process.</p>\n<p id=\"b251-5\">\n<em>DISMISSED.</em>\n</p>\n<footnote label=\"*\">\n<p id=\"b251-19\"> Ellison claims he did not receive written notification of the district court\u2019s order denying his motion to alter or amend until March 10, 2001. Nonetheless, late receipt of a final order does not excuse failure to meet the time limits in Fed. R.App. P. 4. <em>See Hensley v. Chesapeake &amp; Ohio Ry., </em>651 F.2d 226 (4th Cir. 1981); Fed.R.Civ.P. 77(d).</p>\n</footnote>\n</opinion>\n</casebody>\n",
