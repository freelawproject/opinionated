The District Court<footnotemark>1</footnotemark> sentenced Cervantes-Moreno to 6 years and 5 months (seventy-seven months) imprisonment and 3 years supervised release, and he appeals. His counsel has filed a brief and has moved to withdraw pursuant to <em>Anders v. California, </em>386 U.S. 738, 87 S.Ct. 1396, 18 L.Ed.2d 493 (1967). Although we granted Cervantes-Moreno permission to file a pro se supplemental brief, he has not done so.</p>\n<p id=\"b577-11\">As part of his written plea agreement, Cervantes-Moreno waived the right to appeal sentencing issues to which he had stipulated, including his base offense level. We conclude that the waiver was knowing and voluntary: Cervantes-Moreno attended school through the tenth grade; he was not under the influence of drugs or alcohol at the change-of-plea hearing; his prior convictions indicated his experience with the criminal justice system; and he admitted he had read the plea agreement and discussed it with his attorney. See <em>United States v. Michelsen, </em>141 F.3d 867, 871-72 (8th Cir.) (holding that appeal waiver is enforceable so long as it resulted from knowing and voluntary decision; examining personal characteristics of defendant and circumstances surrounding plea agreement), ce<em>rt. denied, </em>525 U.S. 942, 119 S.Ct. 363, 142 L.Ed.2d 299 (1998); <em>United States v.. Greger, </em>98 F.3d 1080, 1081-82 (8th Cir. 1996) (so long as sentence is not in conflict with negotiated plea agreement, knowing and voluntary waiver of right to appeal from sentence will be enforced).</p>\n<p id=\"b577-15\">Accordingly, because we have found no meritorious issues that are not waived, we affirm. We also grant counsel\u2019s motion to withdraw.</p>\n<p id=\"b577-16\">A true copy.</p>\n<footnote label=\"1\">\n<p id=\"b577-12\">.
