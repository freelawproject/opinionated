See Fed. R.App. P. 34(f). The case is therefore submitted without oral argument.</p>\n<p id=\"b924-4\">Defendant-Appellant Jesus Torres-Aquino appeals the district court\u2019s denial of his.motion for downward departure.</p>\n<p id=\"b924-6\">On September 14, 1993, Appellant pled guilty to possessing cocaine, an aggravated felony. After serving 120 days in jail, Appellant was deported to Mexico. On April 11, 2000, Appellant was arrested and later charged with unlawful re-entry after deportation, a violation of 8 U.S.C. \u00a7 1326(a)(1) and (2), and 8 U.S.C. \u00a7 1326(b)(2). A conviction for unlawful reentry typically carries a maximum penalty of two years\u2019 imprisonment. <em>See </em>8 U.S.C. \u00a7 1326(a). However, Appellant was sentenced to forty-one months\u2019 imprisonment and three years of supervised release because of an enhancement that applies when \u201cdefendant previously was deported after a criminal conviction ... [and] the conviction was for an aggravated felony.\u201d U.S. Sentencing Guidelines Manual \u00a7 2L1.2(b)(l)(A) (1999).</p>\n<p id=\"b924-8\">Appellant requested a downward departure in his sentence based on the lack of seriousness of his underlying felony, as permitted in Application Note 5 of \u00a7 2L1.2. At sentencing, the district court stated: \u201cAll right. I\u2019ve read your Motion for Downward Departure. I\u2019ve read the Government\u2019s response. I have the authority [to] downward depart; however, I choose not to do so. This case does not come under a downward departure criteria.\u201d Sentencing Tr. at 2.</p>\n<p id=\"b924-9\">Seizing upon the language of the court\u2019s last sentence, Appellant now claims that the court \u201cerred in its legal conclusion that the factors in this case did not fall under downward departure criteria.\u201d Appellant\u2019s Br. at 8. Appellant points out that he meets the criteria for departure listed in commentary note 5 of \u00a7 2L1.2.</p>\n<p id=\"b924-11\">Viewed as a whole, however, the district court\u2019s statement clearly shows that it understood that it had the authority to depart downward, but simply chose not to do so on the facts of this case. Moreover, we have reiterated <em>ad infinitum </em>that \u201can appellate court lacks jurisdiction to review a sentencing court\u2019s refusal to depart from the Sentencing Guidelines when the sentencing court was aware that it had the authority to depart but declined to exercise that authority.\u201d <em>United States v. Fagan, </em>162 F.3d 1280, 1282 (10th Cir.1998); <em>see also United States v. Fortier, </em>180 F.3d 1217, 1231 (10th Cir.1999) (\u201cThe rule has been stated countless times.\u201d). Accordingly, we dismiss this case for lack of subject-matter jurisdiction.</p>\n<p id=\"b924-12\">For the reasons stated above, the case is DISMISSED.</p>\n<footnote label=\"*\">\n<p id=\"b923-9\"> This order and judgment is not binding precedent, except under the doctrines of law of the case, res judicata, and collateral estoppel. The court generally disfavors the citation of orders and judgments; nevertheless, an order and judgment may be cited under the terms and conditions of 10th Cir. R. 36.3.</p>\n</footnote>\n</opinion>\n</casebody>\n",
