Whitehead seeks a writ of mandamus compelling the district court to consider his application for post-conviction relief as an initial petition filed pursuant to 28 U.S.C. \u00a7 2241 (1994), rather than as a successive petition under section 2255 of the same title. Whitehead maintains that <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"229\">*229</page-number>his two convictions of violating 18 U.S.C.A. \u00a7 924(c)(1) (West Supp.2000) must be vacated in light of the recent decisions of the Supreme Court in <em>Apprendi v. New Jersey, </em>530 U.S. 466, 120 S.Ct. 2348, 147 L.Ed.2d 435 (2000), and <em>Castillo v. United States, </em>530 U.S. 120, 120 S.Ct. 2090, 147 L.Ed.2d 94 (2000).</p>\n<p id=\"b253-5\">The cited authorities are inapposite to Whitehead\u2019s claims. Inasmuch as section 924(c)(1) prescribes no statutory maximum, Whitehead\u2019s sentence does not implicate <em>Apprendi. See </em>530 U.S. at 489, 120 S.Ct. 2348; <em>United States v. Harris, </em>243 F.3d 806, 809 (4th Cir.2001). Moreover, Whitehead has not shown how <em>Castillo </em>(in which the Court concluded that enhanced penalties for particular firearms constitute separate crimes under \u00a7 924(c)(1)) bears on his situation, i.e., where the enhanced sentence was imposed as a result of a second conviction under the statute. Consequently, Whitehead cannot demonstrate a clear right to relief justifying issuance of the writ. <em>See Allied Chem. Corp. v. Daiflon, Inc., </em>449 U.S. 33, 35, 101 S.Ct. 188, 66 L.Ed.2d 193 (1980).</p>\n<p id=\"b253-6\">Accordingly, we grant Whitehead\u2019s motion for leave to proceed in forma pauperis, but we deny his petition for a writ of mandamus directing the district court to consider the underlying claims pursuant to \u00a7 2241.<footnotemark>*</footnotemark> We dispense with oral argument because the facts and legal contentions are adequately presented in the materials before us, and argument would not aid the decisional process.</p>\n<p id=\"b253-7\">\n<em>PETITION DENIED.</em>\n</p>\n<footnote label=\"*\">\n<p id=\"b253-9\"> Our disposition of this appeal renders it unnecessary for us to decide whether a post-conviction claim based on <em>Apprendi </em>may be maintained under \u00a7 2241. We explicitly reserve that question for another day.</p>\n</footnote>\n</opinion>\n</casebody>\n",
