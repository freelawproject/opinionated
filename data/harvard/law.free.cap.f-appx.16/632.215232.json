We have jurisdiction pursuant to 28 U.S.C. \u00a7 1291, and we affirm.</p>\n<p id=\"b657-8\">Robinson contends the district court erred by refusing to grant him a minor role reduction pursuant to U.S.S.G. \u00a7 3B1.2(b). We review for clear error a district court\u2019s determination that a defendant was not a minor participant. <em>See United States v. Benitez, </em>34 F.3d 1489, 1497 (9th Cir.1994).</p>\n<p id=\"b657-9\">The district court here found and the testimonial evidence adduced at trial shows that Robinson entered the store displaying a weapon, ordered everyone to get on the floor, demanded money from the store\u2019s owner, and discharged his weapon in a struggle with the store\u2019s owner. The district court\u2019s determination that Robinson was not a minor participant therefore was not clearly erroneous. <em>See United States v. Pinkney, </em>15 F.3d 825, 826 (9th Cir.1994) (stating that a defendant who participated in a robbery by driving a robber to the scene, storing stolen goods and dispersing checks was not entitled to the minor participant role reduction); <em>cf. United States v. Rojas-Millan, </em>234 F.3d 464, 472 (9th Cir.2000) (holding that minor participant determination must be made relative to all participants in the criminal scheme for which the defendant is charged).</p>\n<p id=\"b657-12\">AFFIRMED.</p>\n<footnote label=\"**\">\n<p id=\"b657-10\"> This disposition is not appropriate for publication and may not be cited to or by the courts of this circuit except as may be provided by 9th Cir.
