Chua argues that there was insufficient evidence for the jury to convict him and that the district court improperly enhanced his sentence for obstruction of justice. We affirm.</p>\n<p id=\"b762-4\">I.</p>\n<p id=\"b762-5\">In 1995, Chua opened a recycling center called 168 America Recycling Company in Carson, California. The California Department of Conservation (\u201cDOC\u201d) later learned that Chua was participating in an illegal scheme to defraud the California Beverage Container Recycling Fund (\u201cthe Fund\u201d). Investigators from the DOC and the Los Angeles District Attorney\u2019s office began surveilling Chua and in August 1997, obtained and executed search warrants for his home and business. During the search, officers found shredded documents in the waste basket in Chua\u2019s office. The shredder was covered by a newspaper and a child\u2019s painting.</p>\n<p id=\"b762-6\">Investigators reconstructed two types of documents from the waste basket. First, it contained \u201ctop sheets\u201d of recent customer receipts which should have been provided to the customers. Investigators concluded that the top sheets were consistent with the creation of fraudulent receipts. The second type of reconstructed document was scrap paper with handwritten notations related to recycling. Investigators determined that these papers also were indicative of a fraudulent scheme.</p>\n<p id=\"b762-10\">On May 13, 1999, Chua was indicted on eight counts of mail fraud in violation of 18 U.S.C. \u00a7 1341.<footnotemark>1</footnotemark> The indictment alleged that Chua devised a scheme to defraud the Fund by purchasing out-of-state beverage containers and redeeming them for California Redemption Value (\u201cCRV\u201d).<footnotemark>2</footnotemark> Counts One through Four of the indictment were based on mailings from various recycling processors through two commercial carrier companies, Federal Express and DHL Worldwide Express (\u201cDHL\u201d). Each mailing allegedly included documents which had been submitted by Chua, the recycler, to the recycling processors. The mail fraud statute was triggered when the processors mailed the fraudulent documents to the Fund with their claims for reimbursement. Counts Five through Eight charged Chua with causing the CRV reimbursement checks to be mailed from the Fund to the recycling processors.<footnotemark>3</footnotemark></p>\n<p id=\"b762-11\">The case was tried to a jury, which returned a guilty verdict on all counts. The court found that substantial evidence in the record justified a two-level sentence increase for obstruction of justice based on Chua\u2019s perjured testimony in the DOC\u2019s investigation and the shredded documents found in the search.</p>\n<p id=\"b762-12\">II.</p>\n<p id=\"b762-13\">A. Sufficiency of the Evidence</p>\n<p id=\"b762-14\">Mail fraud under 18 U.S.C. \u00a7 1341 involves: (1) existence of a scheme to de<page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"739\">*739</page-number>fraud; and (2) using or causing the use of the mails in furtherance of the scheme. <em>See United States v. Stein, </em>37 F.3d 1407, 1408-09 (9th Cir.1994). Chua argues that there was insufficient evidence to prove that the mailings in the first four counts of the indictment were transmitted through a \u201cprivate or commercial interstate carrier\u201d as required by the mail fraud statute. <em>See </em>18 U.S.C. \u00a7 1341. Chua also argues that there was no evidence of any mailing by or caused by him \u201cfor the purpose of executing\u201d the alleged fraudulent scheme. <em>See id.</em></p>\n<p id=\"b763-5\">In reviewing the sufficiency of the evidence to support a conviction, this court considers the evidence in the light most favorable to the prosecution and then determines whether any rational trier of fact could have found the essential elements of the crime beyond a reasonable doubt. <em>See United States v. Aichele, </em>941 F.2d 761, 763 (9th Cir.1991). \u201cThe standard of review employed in sufficiency of the evidence cases is highly deferential.\u201d <em>United States v. Rubio-Villareal, </em>967 F.2d 294, 296 (9th Cir.1992) (en banc).</p>\n<p id=\"b763-6\">1. Interstate Carriers</p>\n<p id=\"b763-7\">The Government introduced witness testimony and documents to show that Federal Express and DHL are interstate carriers. First, a witness from Data Imaging Systems Corporation, the Fund\u2019s intermediary that receives and processes CRY claims, explained how the Fund receives CRY paperwork through the mail or by commercial carriers such as Federal Express, UPS, Airborne Express, and DHL. When asked if DHL was an interstate carrier like Federal Express, the witness replied \u201cI assume so.\u201d The Government also introduced the actual Federal Express and DHL airbills underlying Counts One through Four. The top of the Federal Express airbill was labeled \u201cUSA Airbill.\u201d The DHL airbill included \u201cWorldwide Express\u201d and \u201cShipment Air-waybill\u201d captions, with options for \u201cU.S. Domestic,\u201d \u201cInternational,\u201d and \u2018World-mail\u201d service.</p>\n<p id=\"b763-9\">When viewed in the light most favorable to the verdict, this evidence is sufficient for a rational jury to find that Federal Express and DHL are interstate carriers. The captions and labels on the airbills referencing national and worldwide service are strong indicators of these carriers\u2019 interstate capacity. Witness testimony also provided circumstantial evidence that the couriers deliver packages on an interstate basis. Even though the mailings at issue were delivered within California, the evidence introduced by the Government at trial certainly allowed for the jury to conclude that Federal Express and DHL are interstate carriers.</p>\n<p id=\"b763-10\">2. Mailings Sufficiently Closely Related to the Scheme</p>\n<p id=\"b763-11\">Section 1341 covers \u201cthose limited instances in which the use of the mails is a part of the execution of the fraud.\u201d <em>Kann v. United States, </em>323 U.S. 88, 95, 65 S.Ct. 148, 89 L.Ed. 88 (1944). However, the mailing need only be \u201csufficiently closely related to the scheme\u201d to constitute mail fraud. <em>United States v. Hubbard, </em>96 F.3d 1223, 1228 (9th Cir.1996). The relationship between the mailing and the fraudulent scheme is close enough if the defendant knows \u201cthat the use of the mails will follow in the ordinary course of business, or where such use can reasonably be foreseen, even though not actually intended.\u201d <em>Pereira v. United States, </em>347 U.S. 1, 9, 74 S.Ct. 358, 98 L.Ed. 435 (1954). In other words, mailings that are \u201cincident to an essential part of the scheme\u201d or \u201ca step in [the] plot\u201d fall under the mail fraud statute. <em>Schmuck v. United States, </em>489 U.S. 705, 710-11, 109 S.Ct. 1443, 103 L.Ed.2d 734 (1989) (citations omitted).</p>\n<p id=\"b763-12\">The most instructive authority on the issue before us is the Supreme Court\u2019s <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"740\">*740</page-number>decision in <em>Schmuck, </em>which made the \u201ccritical distinction\u201d between mailings that are for the purpose of, or incidental to, the mail fraud scheme, and mailings that occur after the scheme has reached fruition. <em>See id. </em>at 712, 109 S.Ct. 1443. <em>Schmuck </em>involved a used car distributor who rolled back odometers and sold the cars to unwitting dealers at prices artificially inflated by the low mileage readings. The dealers then sold the cars to retail customers, consummating the transactions by mailing title application forms to the state on behalf of the buyers. The Court found \u201cthat a rational jury could have found that the title-registration mailings were part of the execution of the fraudulent scheme ... which did not reach fruition until the retail dealers resold the cars\u201d and transferred title to the buyer. <em>Id. </em>Even though the title registration mailings were tangential to Schmuck\u2019s duping of the retail dealers and them customers, \u201cthey were necessary to the passage of title, which in turn was essential to the perpetuation of Schmuck\u2019s scheme.\u201d <em>Id. </em>In other words, the success of Schmuck\u2019s scheme depended on a specific and interrelated chain of events which could not have reached fruition without the mailings.<footnotemark>4</footnotemark></p>\n<p id=\"b764-4\">A rational jury could have concluded that Chua\u2019s harmonious relationships with the recycling processors was critical to the success of his scheme. If the processors could not get CRV reimbursement with documents obtained from Chua, they likely would not do business with him. The world of recycling processors in California who participate in CRV transactions presumably is not so vast that Chua could perpetrate his scheme through an endless supply of unwitting participants. Accordingly, Chua\u2019s scheme reached fruition when the Fund mailed CRV reimbursement checks to the recycling processors. These mailings meet the mailing element for mail fraud under \u00a7 1341.</p>\n<p id=\"b764-7\">B. Sentence Enhancement</p>\n<p id=\"b764-8\">This court reviews the district court\u2019s interpretation of the United States Sentencing Guidelines <em>de novo. See United States v. Castellanos, </em>81 F.3d 108,109 (9th Cir.1996). The Court \u201cwill uphold the district court\u2019s factual findings used to support a sentencing enhancement absent clear error.\u201d <em>United States v. Mattarolo, </em>209 F.3d 1153, 1159 (9th Cir.2000).</p>\n<p id=\"b764-9\">The United States Sentencing Guidelines provide for a two-level increase in the offense level for willful obstruction of or attempt to obstruct justice \u201cduring the course of the investigation, prosecution, or sentencing of the instant offense.\u201d U.S.S.G. \u00a7 3C1.1. The obstruction must relate to either \u201c(i) the defendant\u2019s offense of conviction and any relevant conduct; or (ii) a closely related offense.\u201d <em>Id. </em>The commentary to \u00a7 3C1.1 lists, as examples of obstruction of justice, perjury and shredding documents with knowledge of an ongoing investigation. <em>See </em>U.S.S.G. \u00a7 3C1.1 app. 4(b) and (d).</p>\n<p id=\"b764-10\">The district court found that Chua obstructed justice on two independent grounds: (1) he committed perjury in a civil deposition during the course of a state administrative investigation into the same <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"741\">*741</page-number>fraud as the federal investigation; and (2) he destroyed inculpatory documents with knowledge of an ongoing investigation by authorities. Chua contests both grounds of the enhancement.</p>\n<p id=\"b765-5\">Perjury is committed when a \u201cwitness testifying under oath or affirmation ... gives false testimony concerning a material matter with the willful intent to provide false testimony, rather than as a result of confusion, mistake, or faulty memory.\u201d <em>Dunnigan v. United States, </em>507 U.S. 87, 94, 113 S.Ct. 1111, 122 L.Ed.2d 445 (1993). An application of a sentence enhancement based on perjury will be upheld where the court\u2019s findings encompass all of the factual predicates for a finding of perjury. <em>See id. </em>at 95, 113 S.Ct. 1111.</p>\n<p id=\"b765-6\">After presiding at trial and entertaining oral argument on the obstruction issue, the district court adopted the findings in the Pre-Sentence Report (\u201cPSR\u201d), which concluded that Chua provided false testimony and inaccuracies during his deposition that could not be attributed to faulty memory. These findings were clearly supported by the record. <em>See United States v. Monzon-Valenzuela, </em>186 F.3d 1181, 1184 (9th Cir. 1999) (holding that a court may make perfunctory findings so long as they are \u201cclearly supported by the record\u201d). In adopting the PSR, we find that the court made the requisite findings of the elements of perjury.<footnotemark>5</footnotemark> The enhancement applied by the district court is affirmed.<footnotemark>6</footnotemark></p>\n<p id=\"b765-7\">AFFIRMED.</p>\n<footnote label=\"**\">\n<p id=\"b761-15\"> This disposition is not appropriate for publication and may not be cited to or by the courts of this circuit except as may be provided by Ninth Circuit Rule 36-3.</p>\n</footnote>\n<footnote label=\"1\">\n<p id=\"b762-7\">. Chua was indicted along with two co-defendants who are not parties to this appeal.</p>\n</footnote>\n<footnote label=\"2\">\n<p id=\"b762-8\">. CRV is a redeemable deposit, typically 2.5 cents per can or bottle, which customers pay as part of the purchase price for bottled or canned beverages. Customers are repaid CRV when they bring containers to a state certified recycling center. The recycling center then sells the containers to a \u201cprocessor,\u201d who pays the recycling center the CRV and a scrap value. These transactions between recyclers and processors are recorded in a document called a \"DR-6.\u201d The processor then may seek payment of the CRV from the Fund by filing a form called a \u201cDR-7,\u201d which includes as attachments all of the underlying DR-6 forms submitted by the recycling centers for the relevant period. Based on this paperwork, the Fund issues checks to the processors.</p>\n</footnote>\n<footnote label=\"3\">\n<p id=\"b762-15\">. The parties stipulated that these checks were mailed.</p>\n</footnote>\n<footnote label=\"4\">\n<p id=\"b764-5\">. This is distinct from a situation where the mailing is inconsequential to the success of the scheme. <em>See United States v. Maze, </em>414 U.S. 395, 402, 94 S.Ct. 645, 38 L.Ed.2d 603 (1974) (finding \"no indication that the success of [respondent's] scheme depended in any way on which of his victims ultimately bore the loss\u201d through the mailings); <em>Parr v. United States, </em>363 U.S. 370, 393, 80 S.Ct. 1171, 4 L.Ed.2d 1277 (1960) (finding that because the scheme reached fruition when defendants received the goods and services they purchased with a stolen credit card, the mailings through which the bank collected payment were not sufficiently related to the execution of defendants\u2019 scheme to trigger mail fraud statute); <em>Kann, </em>323 U.S. at 94, 65 S.Ct. 148.</p>\n</footnote>\n<footnote label=\"5\">\n<p id=\"b765-9\">. Chua's perjury in the state proceedings related to the federal offense of conviction such that the court's application of \u00a7 3C1.1 was appropriate. <em>See United States v. Luca, </em>183 F.3d 1018, 1022 (9th Cir.1999) (\"For purposes of applying the obstruction enhancement, we can find no convincing reason to distinguish between state and federal law enforcement officers who are investigating the same offense.\").</p>\n</footnote>\n<footnote label=\"6\">\n<p id=\"b765-24\">. Because we affirm the enhancement based on perjury, we need not address the independent grounds of the shredded documents.</p>\n</footnote>\n</opinion>\n</casebody>\n",
