We have reviewed the record and the district court\u2019s opinion and find no reversible error. Accordingly, we affirm on the reasoning of the district court. <em>See Simon v. Group Ins. Plan, </em>No. CA-99-3463-PJM (D.Md. Dec. 20, 2000). No member of this court requested that a poll be taken with respect to Simon\u2019s Suggestion For Hearing En Banc. Accordingly, we deny that petition. We dispense with oral argument because the facts and legal contentions are adequately presented in the materials before the court and argument would not aid the decisional process.</p>\n<p id=\"b164-16\">\n<em>AFFIRMED.</em>\n</p>\n</opinion>\n</casebody>\n",
