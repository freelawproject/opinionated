We affirm. Because the parties are familiar with the facts and prior proceedings, we do not restate them unless necessary.</p>\n<p id=\"b723-16\">A debt is nondischargeable if it is \u201cfor fraud or defalcation while acting in a fiduciary capacity.\u201d 11 U.S.C. \u00a7 523(a)(4). \u201cThe definition of defalcation includes both the \u2018misappropriation of trust funds or money held in any fiduciary capacity; [and the] failure to properly account for such funds.\u2019 \u201d <em>Blyler v. Hemmeter (In re Hemmeter), </em>242 F.3d 1186, 1190 (9th Cir. 2001) (quoting <em>Lewis v. Scott (In re Lewis), </em>97 F.3d 1182, 1186 (9th Cir.1996)).</p>\n<p id=\"b723-17\">Under California law, Briles was acting in her capacity as a licensed real estate broker when she arranged the loan from Stevens to the Aguilars. <em>See </em>Calif. Bus. <em>&amp; </em>Prof.Code \u00a7 10131(d). Briles was therefore acting in a fiduciary capacity under \u00a7 523(a)(4). <em>See Bugna v. McArthur (In re Bugna), </em>33 F.3d 1054, 1057 (9th Cir.1994).</p>\n<p id=\"b723-18\">Briles argues that even if she was acting in a fiduciary capacity, she did not commit defalcation because the arbitration decision does not establish that she was entrusted with property or funds. We disagree. The arbitration decision establishes that Briles caused the trust deed to be \u201cdelivered to [her] unrecorded for the benefit of 'Stevens.\u201d Further, Stevens \u201crelied on Briles to get the trust deed recorded without prejudice to Stevens\u2019 security position.\u201d The Aguilar purchase closed on March 23,1990, but the trust deed was not recorded until April 24, 1990, by which time the Internal Revenue Service (\u201cIRS\u201d) had recorded a lien with priority over the Stevens\u2019. There is no evidence that the Stevens ever held the trust deed. According to the arbitrator, the circumstantial <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"700\">*700</page-number>evidence was that the person who recorded the trust deed was either Briles or someone acting at her direction. The arbitrator also found that Briles delayed the recording in part to conceal the loan\u2019s existence and thereby to protect her substantial commission on the Aguilar purchase.</p>\n<p id=\"b724-4\">By delaying the recording, Briles permitted the IRS to record a lien ahead of Stevens. In so doing, Briles substantially reduced the value of property with which she had been entrusted and over which she had control. We hold that this conduct constitutes defalcation either as a failure to account for property or as a misappropriation of property.</p>\n<p id=\"b724-5\">AFFIRMED.</p>\n<footnote label=\"*\">\n<p id=\"b723-14\"> This disposition is not appropriate for publication and may not be cited to or by the courts of this circuit except as may be provided by Ninth Circuit Rule 36-3.</p>\n</footnote>\n</opinion>\n</casebody>\n",
