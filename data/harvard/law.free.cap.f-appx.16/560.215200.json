Mosley had two passengers in the vehicle with him, and officers observed both of them to be in possession of crack cocaine. The passengers were arrested at the scene. Upon verifying Mosley\u2019s driver\u2019s license information, officers discovered that Mosley had an outstanding felony parole warrant issued by the state of Kansas. Mosley, too, was arrested, and a subsequent search of Mosley\u2019s vehicle yielded a .22 caliber handgun that was located under the vehicle\u2019s driver\u2019s seat. Mosley admitted during police questioning that he had handled the gun, including loading and unloading it with ammunition, and that his fingerprints would be found on the gun.</p>\n<p id=\"b585-9\">A jury convicted Mosley of being a felon in possession of a firearm in violation of 18 U.S.C. \u00a7\u00a7 922(g)(1) and 924(e) (1994). On appeal, Mosley challenges the district court\u2019s<footnotemark>1</footnotemark> denial of his motion to suppress evidence obtained while he was stopped by police officers, the district court\u2019s denial of Mosley\u2019s motion in limine seeking to exclude other bad acts evidence, and the district court\u2019s<footnotemark>2</footnotemark> denial of Mosley\u2019s motion for judgment of acquittal.</p>\n<p id=\"b585-10\">We conclude that the district court did not err in denying Mosley\u2019s motion to suppress his statements made to officers, because contrary to Mosley\u2019s assertion, officers had probable cause for initially stopping the vehicle Mosley was driving after watching him drive for four blocks in the dark without his headlights illuminated, which is a traffic violation. <em>See United States v.. Jones, </em>255 F.3d 628, 631 (8th Cir.2001) (\u201c[T]his Court has held on numerous occasions that <em>any </em>traffic violation, regardless of its perceived severity, provides an officer with probable cause to stop the driver.\u201d). The officers were entitled to conduct a reasonable investigation, including asking for a license and registration and questioning Mosley. <em>United States v. Edmisten, </em>208 F.3d 693, 694 (8th Cir. 2000), <em>cert. denied, </em>\u2014 U.S. -, 121 S.Ct. 1158, 148 L.Ed.2d 1018 (2001); <em>United States v. Perez, </em>200 F.3d 576, 579 (8th Cir.2000). In addition, the district court did not abuse its discretion in denying Mosley\u2019s motion in limine because the government was allowed to set forth the circumstances surrounding Mosley\u2019s arrest. <em>See United States v.. Summers, </em>137 F.3d 597, 602 (8th Cir.1998) (holding \u201cbad acts that form the factual setting of the crime in issue\u201d outside the scope of Rule 404(b)).</p>\n<p id=\"b585-16\">Finally, Mosley argues that the evidence presented at trial was insufficient to support a conviction for being a felon in possession. We disagree and conclude that the district court did not err in declining to grant a judgment of acquittal. For purposes of being a felon in possession of a firearm, possession may be either actual or constructive. <em>United States v. Miscellaneous Firearms &amp; Ammunition, </em>945 F.2d 239, 240 (8th Cir.1991). \u201cConstructive possession of the firearm is established if the <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"562\">*562</page-number>person has dominion over the premises where the firearm is located, or control, ownership, or dominion over the firearm itself.\u201d <em>United States v. Boykin, </em>986 F.2d 270, 274 (8th Cir.), <em>cert. denied, </em>510 U.S. 888, 114 S.Ct. 241, 126 L.Ed.2d 195 (1993). In this case the evidence overwhelmingly supports both actual and constructive possession: Mosley admitted to officers that he actually possessed the firearm by handling it in the vehicle where the weapon was recovered \u2014 a vehicle that Mosley controlled. Accordingly, we affirm the judgment of the district court.</p>\n<footnote label=\"1\">\n<p id=\"b585-11\">.
