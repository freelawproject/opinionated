He raises four issues: (1) that the court erred in sentencing him under the career offender guideline, United States Sentencing Guidelines Manual (\u201cU.S.S.G.\u201d) \u00a7 4B1.1; (2) that his sentence resulted from ineffective assistance of counsel; (3) that the court erred in failing to hold a competency hearing before accepting his plea; and (4) that counsel\u2019s failure to secure a mental health evaluation constituted ineffective assistance of counsel.</p>\n<p id=\"b36-15\">APPLICATION OF THE CAREER OFFENDER GUIDELINE TO DEDRICK</p>\n<p id=\"b36-16\">Dedrick pled guilty to two counts of the indictment, charging him with distribution of crack cocaine on two occasions, April 16 and April 30, 1997. Because Dedrick had two prior state felony convictions, the district court sentenced him as a career offender under U.S.S.G. \u00a7 4B1.1.</p>\n<p id=\"b36-17\">Dedrick\u2019s principal argument is that the court erred in treating the prior state offenses as predicates of his criminal history, rather than as relevant conduct. Had the court accepted his Guideline application, he would have avoided application of U.S.S.G. \u00a7 4B1.1, which automatically placed him in criminal history category VI instead of IV and increased his offense level. His somewhat tortured argument proceeds from U.S.S.G. \u00a7 4A1.2, cmt. n. 1 (\u201cDefinitions and Instructions for Computing Criminal History\u201d), which states that a \u201cprior sentence\u201d does not include a sentence \u201cfor conduct that is part of the instant offense.\u201d To bring himself within this provision, Dedrick points to the conspiracy charged in the indictment, which he says was established by stipulation and, under U.S.S.G. \u00a7 lB1.2(c) (\u201cApplicable Guidelines\u201d), must therefore be counted as an offense of conviction. As such, it would encompass the drug offenses \u2014 the conduct on which the prior state convictions were based \u2014 making them relevant conduct, rather than prior convictions for purposes of U.S.S.G. \u00a7 4B1.1.</p>\n<p id=\"b36-18\">Ingenious as it may be, the argument will not hold water. To begin with, the conspiracy charge was dismissed by the government. The straw at which Dedrick <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"13\">*13</page-number>grasps is the parties\u2019 stipulation in the plea agreement that the quantity of drugs attributable to Dedrick was between 50 and 150 grams. But this amount, as noted in the district court\u2019s meticulous sentencing memorandum, is far in excess of the amounts involved in the offenses to which he pled and for which he was sentenced. Even if the larger amounts in the plea agreement could be said to cover other offense conduct, there is nothing in the agreement or the sentencing proceedings to suggest that Dedrick was treated by the government or the court as having participated in a conspiracy, much less as having stipulated to one. <em>See, e.g., United States v. Collar, </em>904 F.2d 441 (8th Cir.1990) (holding that where defendant stipulated to elements of two robberies dismissed by the government, these offense were properly included in base offense level calculation).</p>\n<p id=\"b37-5\">Once the conspiracy argument collapses, Dedrick\u2019s attack on the sentence fails. The commentary in the Relevant Conduct guideline, U .S.S.G. \u00a7 1B1.3, specifically provides that \u201coffense conduct associated with a sentence that was imposed prior to the acts ... constituting the instant federal offense (the offense of conviction) is not considered as part of the same course of conduct or common scheme or plan as the offense of conviction.\u201d This guideline clearly precludes treatment of the prior state convictions as relevant conduct in the instant case.</p>\n<p id=\"b37-6\">Dedrick contends that to the extent the foregoing argument fails, he was denied the effective assistance of counsel. He argues that counsel was ineffective in advising him to plead to the two distribution counts and failing to ensure that the conspiracy charge was included in the offense stipulation. We ordinarily review ineffective assistance claims in collateral proceedings under 28 U.S .C. \u00a7 2255, rather than on direct appeal. <em>See United States v. Mala, </em>7 F.3d 1058, 1063 (1st Cir.1993). We address the claim here, however, because the record is complete and the facts are undisputed.</p>\n<p id=\"b37-8\">Dedrick\u2019s ineffective assistance claim is without merit. The district judge addressed the very issue in her sentencing memorandum and concluded that offenses which resulted in sentences prior to the commission of the instant offenses could not be considered related. To the extent counsel advised Dedrick to enter into the agreement to a much higher quantity of drugs than was attributable to him under the offense of conviction, there was no prejudice because the sentence was not based on the stipulated quantity. Nor has Dedrick shown that his sentence would have been lower had he stipulated to a lesser quantity of drugs. Without demonstrating a reasonable probability that, but for counsel\u2019s error, the result of the proceedings would have been different, Dedrick\u2019s ineffective assistance claim fails. <em>See L\u00f3pez-Nieves v. United States, </em>917 F.2d 645, 648 (1st Cir.1990).</p>\n<p id=\"b37-9\">FAILURE TO ORDER A COMPETENCY EXAMINATION</p>\n<p id=\"b37-10\">Under 18 U.S.C. \u00a7 4241(a) (\u201cDetermination of Mental Competency to Stand Trial\u201d), the district court must order a competency hearing \u201cif there is reasonable cause to believe that the defendant may presently be suffering from a mental ... defect rendering him mentally incompetent to the extent that he is unable to understand the nature and consequences of the proceedings against him or to assist properly in his defense.\u201d Because no motion was made by Dedrick below, we review for plain error. <em>See United States v. Gir\u00f3n-Reyes, </em>234 F.3d 78, 80 (1st Cir. 2000).</p>\n<p id=\"b37-11\">Dedrick contends that because the district court knew that he had a \u201cde facto\u201d <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"14\">*14</page-number>fifth-grade education and may be \u201cborderline retarded\u201d and observed his confusion when asked whether he wished to change his plea, failure to order a competency hearing was plain error and violated Dedrick\u2019s due process rights. For the same reasons, he argues that counsel rendered ineffective assistance by failing to secure a mental health examination.</p>\n<p id=\"b38-4\">We disagree. The circumstances described led the district judge to take pains to ensure Dedrick\u2019s rights were protected. The judge inquired whether any collateral challenges to the prior convictions were available to the defendant and counsel responded that there were none that could be made. Counsel stated that although Dedrick suffered from some degree of limited intelligence, in discussing the prior convictions, he had assured counsel that he felt he had been advised of his rights and that the proceedings had been proper. When counsel advised the court that Dedrick may be borderline retarded, the judge allowed counsel to consult with him. Counsel then returned with Dedrick and, without further discussion, the plea colloquy proceeded. While at one point, Dedrick showed confusion over whether he wished to change his plea, after conferring with counsel, he continued with the colloquy and responded appropriately to the court\u2019s questions. We are satisfied that the district judge, after having been assured by Dedrick\u2019s counsel that \u201cI don\u2019t think he is retarded to a degree that he does not understand the proceedings here,\u201d did not abuse her discretion in accepting the plea as knowing and voluntary and not ordering a competency hearing.</p>\n<p id=\"b38-5\">We recognize that a mentally retarded person may be capable of understanding the nature and consequences of the proceedings against him and yet be unable to assist properly in his defense. <em>See United States v. Duhon, </em>104 F.Supp.2d 663, 666, 671 (E.D.La.2000). There is no evidence that this is such a case. Dedrick also fails to demonstrate that but for counsel\u2019s failure to secure a hearing, the course of the proceedings would have been altered in his favor, e.g., that he would not have pled guilty. <em>See Hern\u00e1ndez Hern\u00e1ndez v. United States, </em>904 F.2d 758, 761 (1st Cir.1990). Accordingly, there is no basis for finding ineffective assistance for counsel\u2019s failure to move for a competency hearing.</p>\n<p id=\"b38-7\">AFFIRMED.</p>\n</opinion>\n</casebody>\n",
