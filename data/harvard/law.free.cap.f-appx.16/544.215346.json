The district court<footnotemark>1</footnotemark> sentenced him to 168 months imprisonment and 5 years supervised release. Hernandez raises five issues on appeal, each of which we reject.</p>\n<p id=\"b569-12\">We conclude that the district court did not err in denying Hernandez\u2019s motion for judgment of acquittal, as there was sufficient evidence of his guilt, <em>see United States v. James, </em>172 F.3d 588, 591 (8th Cir.1999) (standard of review); did not clearly err in determining Hernandez\u2019s drug quantity based on the testimony of the government witnesses, which the court was entitled to believe, <em>see United States v. Milton, </em>153 F.3d 891, 898 (8th Cir.1998) (standard of <em>review), cert. denied, </em>525 U.S. 1165, 119 S.Ct. 1082, 143 L.Ed.2d 83 (1999); and did not clearly err in applying an obstruction-of-justice enhancement, having found that Hernandez perjured himself at trial, <em>see United States v. Molina, </em>172 F.3d 1048, 1058 (8th Cir.) (standard of review), <em>cert. denied, </em>528 U.S. 893, 120 S.Ct. 221, 145 L.Ed.2d 186 (1999). Finally, the court\u2019s discretionary decisions not to depart downward from the Guidelines are unreviewable on appeal. <em>See United States v. Lim, </em>235 F.3d 382, 385 (8th Cir.2000).</p>\n<p id=\"b569-16\">Accordingly, we affirm the judgment of the district court.</p>\n<footnote label=\"1\">\n<p id=\"b569-13\">. The Honorable R.E. Longstaff, Chief Judge, United States District Court for the Southern District of Iowa.</p>\n</footnote>\n</opinion>\n</casebody>\n",
