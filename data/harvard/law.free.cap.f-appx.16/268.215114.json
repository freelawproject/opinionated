The court dismissed Bedell\u2019s complaint based on his failure to comply with its prior order directing him to submit proof that he had exhausted his administrative remedies. In denying the motion for reconsideration, the district court found that proof of exhaustion had not been received by the court.</p>\n<p id=\"b293-4\"><page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"269\">*269</page-number>Because Bedell may proceed with this action by amending his complaint to provide the information requested by the court, his appeal of the order of dismissal is interlocutory and not subject to appellate review. <em>See Domino Sugar Corp. v. Sugar Workers Local Union 392, </em>10 F.3d 1064, 1066-67 (4th Cir.1993).</p>\n<p id=\"b293-5\">We therefore dismiss the appeal. We also deny Bedell\u2019s motions for appointment of counsel and for return to Vermont and his motions for judgment on the pleadings and for production of documents. We dispense with oral argument because the facts and legal contentions are adequately presented in the materials before the court and argument would not aid the decisional process.</p>\n<p id=\"b293-6\">\n<em>DISMISSED.</em>\n</p>\n</opinion>\n</casebody>\n",
