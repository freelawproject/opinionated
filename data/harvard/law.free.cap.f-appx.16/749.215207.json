We have jurisdiction pursuant to 18 U.S.C. \u00a7 3742(a) and 28 U.S.C. \u00a7 1291, and we affirm.</p>\n<p id=\"b774-16\">The district court did not abuse its discretion in relying on the presentence report (\u201cPSR\u201d) and the probation officer\u2019s testimony to add one criminal history point for Appellant\u2019s 1991 conviction for driving under the influence and driving with a suspended license.<footnotemark>1</footnotemark> The computerized criminal history on which the PSR relied was reliable, and the probation officer \u201chad no reason to prevaricate.\u201d <em>United States v. Marin-Cuevas, </em>147 F.3d 889, 895 (9th Cir.1998). The PSR accordingly bore \u201csufficient indicia of reliability\u201d to be considered at sentencing. <em>Id. </em>Appellant has challenged the reliability of the computerized search in only a vague way, merely asserting that the search is not always accurate, but he has presented no evidence to substantiate this claim. Furthermore, although Appellant challenged the accuracy of the PSR, by denying that he was convicted of driving under the influence, he presented no evidence on which the district court could have relied to make its finding. The district court\u2019s finding that he was convicted of driving under the influence, which formed the basis for the imposition of the criminal history point, was not clearly erroneous. <em>See id. </em>(reviewing district court\u2019s factual determinations for clear error). Appellant\u2019s reliance on <em>United States v. Franklin, </em>235 F.3d 1165 (9th Cir.2000), is unavailing because the standard of proof required of the government in <em>Franklin, </em>an Armed Career <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"751\">*751</page-number>Criminal Act case, was \"much higher than that here. We also reject Appellant\u2019s contention that the district court erred in relying on a prior aggravated felony conviction in determining his sentence because the conviction was neither set forth in the indictment nor admitted in the guilty plea. This argument has been foreclosed by <em>Almendarez-Torres v. United States, </em>523 U.S. 224, 118 S.Ct. 1219, 140 L.Ed.2d 350 (1998), and by <em>United States v. Pacheco-Zepeda, </em>234 F.3d 411 (9th Cir. 2000), <em>cert. denied, </em>\u2014 U.S. \u2014, 121 S.Ct. 1503, 149 L.Ed.2d 388 (2001). The sentence imposed by the district court is therefore \u2022</p>\n<p id=\"b775-5\">AFFIRMED.</p>\n<footnote label=\"**\">\n<p id=\"b774-14\"> This disposition is not appropriate for publication and may not be cited to or by the courts of this circuit except as provided by Ninth Cir.
