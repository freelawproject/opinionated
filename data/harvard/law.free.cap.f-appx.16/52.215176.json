Telesca, <em>Judge, </em>granting summary judgment dismissing his complaint alleging racial discrimination in violation of Title VII of the Civil Rights Act of 1964, 42 U.S.C. \u00a7 2000e <em>et seq. </em>We affirm substantially for the reasons stated in Judge Telesca\u2019s Decision and Order dated April 12, 2000.</p>\n<p id=\"b76-24\">On appeal, Jacque contends principally that summary judgment should not have been granted before he obtained additional discovery. Apparently related to that discovery argument, Jacque has also filed two motions for \u201cReconnaissance and Proffer.\u201d However, Jacque has neither identified documents that should have been produced nor indicated how they would have supported his claims of racial discrimination. Nor has he pointed to anything in the record to show that the district court abused its discretion with respect to discovery. Accordingly, his discovery arguments provide no basis for reversal; his \u201cReconnaissance and Proffer\u201d motions are denied.</p>\n<p id=\"b76-25\">Jacque also contends that the district court should have appointed counsel to represent him. We see no abuse of discretion in the court\u2019s denial of that request. <em>See generally Hendricks v. Coughlin, </em>114 F.3d 390, 392 (2d Cir.1997); <em>Pena v. Choo, </em><page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"53\">*53</page-number>826 F.2d 168, 168-69 (2d Cir.1987) (per curiam).</p>\n<p id=\"b77-5\">We have considered all of Jacque\u2019s contentions that are properly before us and have found in them no basis for reversal. Issues argued on appeal that were not raised in the district court are not properly before us, and we see no indication that the interests of justice require us to entertain them. <em>See generally Singleton v. Wulff, </em>428 U.S. 106, 121, 96 S.Ct. 2868, 49 L.Ed.2d 826 (1976).</p>\n<p id=\"b77-6\">The judgment of the district court is affirmed.</p>\n</opinion>\n</casebody>\n",
