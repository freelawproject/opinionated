Pettiford, an African American elementary school teacher, with bachelor\u2019s and master\u2019s degrees in education and over thirty years of teaching experience, brought this action against Granville County, the Granville County School System, the Granville County Board of Education, individual board members, and various school administrative officials. In a multicount complaint, Ms. Pettiford alleges, <em>inter alia, </em>that the various defendants engaged in employment practices that discriminated against her on the basis of race and age in violation of state and federal law, breached contractual rights owed to her by forcing her resignation and refusing to deal fairly with her, coerced her resignation by improper threats, failed to provide her notice and other procedural rights guaranteed by state law, wrongfully discharged her in retaliation for her complaints about her assignments and working conditions, and caused her severe emotional distress. Ms. Pettiford requests compensatory and punitive damages and injunctive relief in the form of removal of a certain letter dated May 21, 1996 from her personnel file, receipt of a grievance hearing, promotion to a tenured teaching position, and an apology from the defendants.</p>\n<p id=\"b137-17\">All of Ms. Pettiford\u2019s claims grow out of her attempts to gain employment with Granville County School System in 1992 and 1993 and her subsequent resignation from the employment she ultimately did obtain as a non-tenured, contractual \u201cChapter I\u201d teacher. The district court, after painstakingly considering Ms. Pettiford\u2019s detailed complaint, granted the various defendants\u2019 motion to dismiss the action, in a thorough twenty-six page opinion.</p>\n<p id=\"b137-18\">We have carefully reviewed the briefs and record in this case, considered the oral and written arguments of the parties and the relevant legal authorities, and conclude that we must affirm. As the district court explained, Ms. Pettiford makes no allegations stating a \u201cfactual or legal basis supporting liability of the County,\u201d all of her federal employment discrimination claims and most of her state claims are time-barred, and her remaining state law claims are meritless. Accordingly, we affirm on the basis of the district court\u2019s well reasoned opinion. <em>See Pettiford v. Granville County, </em>No. 5:99-CV-484-F(3) (E.D.N.C. June 1, 2000).</p>\n<p id=\"b137-19\">\n<em>AFFIRMED.</em>\n</p>\n</opinion>\n</casebody>\n",
