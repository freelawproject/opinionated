He received an enhanced sentence as an armed career criminal under 18 U .S.C.A. \u00a7 924(e) (West 2000) based on three prior felony convictions. On appeal, Robertson claims that, under <em>Apprendi v. New Jersey, </em>530 U.S. 466, 120 S.Ct. 2348, 147 L.Ed.2d 435 (2000), the district court erred in sentencing him under \u00a7 924(e) where the indictment charged him under \u00a7 922(g), which carries a maximum penalty of ten years.</p>\n<p id=\"b298-8\">However, in <em>Apprendi, </em>the Supreme Court expressly declined to overrule <em>Almendarez-Torres v. United States, </em>523 U.S. 224, 118 S.Ct. 1219, 140 L.Ed.2d 350 (1998), which held that prior felony convictions are mere sentence enhancements and not elements of an offense. <em>See also United States v. Skidmore, </em>254 F.3d 635 (7th Cir.2001) (holding that enhanced sentence under \u00a7 924(e) did not violate <em>Apprendi </em>where defendant had requisite three prior felony convictions); <em>United States v. Dorris, </em>236 F.3d 582, 586-88 (10th Cir.2000) (same), <em>cert. denied, </em>69 U.S.L.W. 3672 (U .S. April 16, 2001) (No. 00-8937); <em>United States v. Mack, </em>229 F.3d 226, 235 n. 12 (3d Cir.2000) (same), <em>cert. denied, </em>69 U.S.L W. 3739 (U.S. May 21, 2001).</p>\n<p id=\"b298-9\">Accordingly, we affirm Robertson\u2019s sentence. We dispense with oral argument because the facts and legal contentions are adequately presented in the materials before the court and argument would not aid the decisional process.</p>\n<p id=\"b298-10\">\n<em>AFFIRMED.</em>\n</p>\n</opinion>\n</casebody>\n",
