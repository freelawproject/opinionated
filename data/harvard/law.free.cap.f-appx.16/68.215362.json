McKenna, Judge), it is hereby</p>\n<p id=\"b93-10\">ORDERED, ADJUDGED AND DECREED that the order granting, in part, defendants\u2019 motions to suppress is REVERSED and the case REMANDED.</p>\n<p id=\"b93-11\">The district court held that although knowledge of facts supporting probable cause for arrest can be presumed to be shared among law enforcement officers cooperating in an investigation and in communication, \u201cthe presumption [of communication between the officers] may be rebutted,\u201d thereby invaliding a showing of probable cause premised upon it. Op. at 11. Even assuming, for the purposes of this appeal, that a presumption of \u201ccollective knowledge\u201d can be rebutted, we hold that the district court clearly erred in finding that defendants successfully rebutted any such presumption in this case.</p>\n<p id=\"b93-12\">Principally at issue is testimony by DEA Agent Robert Barnett concerning the smell of marijuana that he detected shortly after defendant Lovell Lee had rolled down the window to a van Lee was driving.<footnotemark>1</footnotemark> In answer to the question \u201cDid you say anything to anybody to indicate that you smelled marijuana?\u201d, Agent Barnett responded \u201cNo, sir.\u201d Although the district court found, based on this testimony, that Agent Barnett had never communicated information about the smell of marijuana to anyone at any time, the question itself provided no time frame. The context indicates that Agent Barnett was only discussing what he said or did during the stop of the van and not what he may have communicated to others after the stop. In the preceding question to Agent Barnett, the line of inquiry was limited to the events surrounding the stop by asking \u201cAt what point did you <em>first </em>smell marijuana?\u201d (emphasis added), to which Agent Barnett responded \u201cShortly thereafter [Lee] rolled down the window.\u201d This demonstrates that Agent Barnett\u2019s answer to the question as to what he told others about the smell of marijuana did not extend to what Barnett may have later communicated to other officers.</p>\n<p id=\"b93-16\">In addition, there is no evidence that the agents did not communicate other relevant information they possessed. Agent Barnett testified that he had noticed \u201csome green plant material\u201d on Lee\u2019s shirt that Barnett believed to be marijuana. The district court stated it was \u201cnot really likely\u201d but admitted that it \u201cmight be presumed\u201d that Agent Barnett passed this information along. Op. at 16. Also, Agent Cline testified that he saw \u201csome type of compressed gas tanks\u201d in the backseat of the van. Although Agent Cline testified that he did not know the significance of these tanks, particularly for the hydroponic production of marijuana, when he first opened the van door, there is nothing in the record to show that he did not later <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"70\">*70</page-number>communicate his observation to other officers.</p>\n<p id=\"b94-4\">The district court found that \u201cthere was certainly some communication between the DEA agents who participated in the surveillance, the stop and the arrests.\u201d Op. at 12. Because we hold that the district court clearly erred in finding defendants had rebutted the presumption of communication (assuming such a presumption exists and is, in fact, rebuttable), the order of the district court, inasmuch as it granted defendants-appellees\u2019 motions to suppress, is hereby REVERSED and the case REMANDED.</p>\n<footnote label=\"1\">\n<p id=\"b93-13\">. The district court found that the testimony at the suppression hearing of Agent Barnett and Agent Michael Cline \"was credible in its entirety.\u201d Op. at 6 n.2.</p>\n</footnote>\n</opinion>\n</casebody>\n",
