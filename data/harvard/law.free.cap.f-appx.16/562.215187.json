Loucks pleaded guilty to being a felon in possession of a firearm, in violation of 18 U.S.C. \u00a7 922(g)(1). At sentencing, he objected to the use of his prior felony conviction for terroristic threats both to enhance his offense level under U.S.S.G. \u00a7 2K2.1(a)(4)(A) and to establish his criminal history under U.S.S.G. \u00a7 4A1.2(a), arguing that this constituted double jeopardy and impermissible double counting. The district court<footnotemark>1</footnotemark> overruled his objection, and sentenced him to 46 months imprisonment and 3 years supervised release.</p>\n<p id=\"b586-23\">Loucks renews his arguments on appeal. We reject his claim of impermissible double counting because the Sentencing Guidelines specifically authorize this type of double counting. <em>See </em>U.S.S.G. \u00a7 2K2.1, comment, (n.15) (\u201cPrior felony conviction^) resulting in an increased base of<page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"563\">*563</page-number>fense level under subsection ... (a)(4)(A) ... are also counted for purposes of determining criminal history points pursuant to Chapter Four, Part A (Criminal History).\u201d); <em>United States v. Rohwedder, </em>243 F.3d 423, 427 (8th Cir.2001) (\u201cDouble counting is permissible if the Sentencing Commission intended that result and each section concerns conceptually separate notions relating to sentencing.\u201d). Loucks\u2019s double jeopardy argument also lacks merit. <em>See Munger v. Erickson, </em>979 F.2d 1323, 1326 n. 8 (8th Cir.1992) (taking defendant\u2019s prior conviction into account in sentencing him for subsequent offense does not constitute double jeopardy violation; defendant is being punished only for subsequent offense).</p>\n<p id=\"b587-5\">Accordingly, we affirm the judgment of the district court.</p>\n<p id=\"b587-6\">A true copy.</p>\n<footnote label=\"1\">\n<p id=\"b586-15\">.
