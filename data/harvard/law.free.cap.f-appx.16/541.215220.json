Eline, who was convicted of a crime and initially incarcerated in Hawaii, sought damages and immediate release based on his claim that he had been falsely imprisoned at a privately owned facility in Minnesota. We conclude the District Court did not abuse its discretion in dismissing Eline\u2019s complaint for failure to comply with the Court\u2019s order to submit a properly completed in forma pauperis application and partial filing fee. See Fed.R.Civ.P. 41(b) (court may dismiss action for failure to comply with court order); <em>In re Reid, </em>197 F.3d 318, 320 (8th Cir.1999) (standard of review); <em>Brown v. Frey, </em>806 F.2d 801, 803 (8th Cir.1986) (court may sua sponte dismiss action for pro se litigant\u2019s failure to comply with any court order). We note that Eline would not be entitled to release or damages on the basis he asserted, as an inmate has no constitutional right to be housed at a particular location. See <em>Olim v. Wakinekona, </em>461 U.S. 238, 245, 103 S.Ct. 1741, 75 L.Ed.2d 813 (1983) (just as inmate has no justifiable expectation that he will be incarcerated in any particular prison within state, he has no justifiable expectation that he will be incarcerated within any particular state).</p>\n<p id=\"b566-15\">Accordingly, we affirm. See 8th Cir. R. 47B.</p>\n<footnote label=\"1\">\n<p id=\"b566-13\">. The Honorable Michael J. Davis, United States District Judge for the District of Minnesota, adopting the report and recommendations of the Honorable John M. Mason, United States Magistrate Judge for the District of Minnesota.</p>\n</footnote>\n</opinion>\n</casebody>\n",
