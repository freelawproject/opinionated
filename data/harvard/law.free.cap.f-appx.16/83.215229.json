(VenTech) appeals the district court\u2019s order granting summary judgment to Colt\u2019s Plastics Co., Inc. (Colt\u2019s Plastics) in this action seeking to impose liability for a judgment against Venture Media Limited Partnership (Venture Media) on VenTech, Venture Media\u2019s general partner. We affirm.</p>\n<p id=\"b107-25\">Under Fed.R.Civ.P. 5(a),(b), the motion for summary judgment was properly served by mail. VenTech, as Venture Media\u2019s general partner, was liable for the judgment in question, even though VenTech was not a party to the contract with Colt\u2019s Plastics that Venture Media breached. Md.Code Ann., Corps <em>&amp; </em>Assn\u2019s \u00a7 9-307 (1999); <em>Bennett Heating &amp; Air Conditioning, Inc. v. NationsBank of Md., </em>103 Md.App. 749, 654 A.2d 949, 959 (1995), <em>rev\u2019d on other grounds, </em>342 Md. 169, 674 A.2d 534 (1996). Finally, Venture Media affirmatively concealed that VenTech was its general partner. Therefore, the limitations period as to VenTech did not begin to run until 1999, when Colt\u2019s Plastics, while <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"84\">*84</page-number>investigating Venture Media\u2019s assets, discovered VenTech and its relationship to Venture Media. Accordingly, we affirm on the reasoning of the district court. <em>See Colt\u2019s Plastics Co. v. VenTech, Inc., </em>No. CA-99-3727-JFM (D.Md. Jul. 28, 2000). We dispense with oral argument because the facts and legal contentions are adequately presented in the materials before the court and argument would not aid the decisional process.</p>\n<p id=\"b108-4\">\n<em>AFFIRMED.</em>\n</p>\n</opinion>\n</casebody>\n",
