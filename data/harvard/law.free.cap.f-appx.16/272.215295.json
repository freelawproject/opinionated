The district court construed Murrell\u2019s action as one for habeas corpus relief under 28 U.S.C.A. \u00a7 2254 (West 1994 <em>&amp; </em>Supp.2000) after finding Murrell\u2019s action, which alleges he was arrested without probable cause, challenged the fact or duration of his incarceration. On appeal, however, Murrell argues that the incident that forms the basis of his \u00a7 1983 complaint is unconnected to his current incarceration.</p>\n<p id=\"b297-15\">We have reviewed the record and the district court\u2019s opinion and find the record before us is inadequate to evaluate the propriety of the district court\u2019s action. Accordingly, we remand Murrell\u2019s claim to the district court for further proceedings to ascertain if in fact Murrell\u2019s allegations in this complaint amount to an attack on a conviction for which he was incarcerated. The record, as supplemented, will then be returned to this court for further proceedings. We dispense with oral argument because the facts and legal contentions are adequately presented in the material before the court and argument would not aid the decisional process.</p>\n<p id=\"b297-16\">\n<em>REMANDED.</em>\n</p>\n</opinion>\n</casebody>\n",
