At sentencing, the district court<footnotemark>1</footnotemark> imposed enhancements based upon the value of funds, Ploetz\u2019s knowledge that the funds were proceeds of an illegal activity, and Ploetz\u2019s abuse of a position of trust; the court also granted Ploetz\u2019s departure motion based upon his diminished mental capacity. The court sentenced Ploetz to concurrent terms of 24 months imprisonment and three years supervised release on each count, and ordered him to pay $203,097 in restitution. On appeal, Ploetz challenges each of the enhancements, the extent of the court\u2019s departure, and the denial of his motion for departure based on post-offense rehabilitation; he also challenges the enhancements under <em>Apprendi v. New Jersey, </em>530 U.S. 466, 120 S.Ct. 2348, 147 L.Ed.2d 435 (2000).</p>\n<p id=\"b551-24\">Having carefully reviewed the record, we conclude the district court did not err in imposing each enhancement, for the reasons stated by the district court; further, we do not review the extent of the departure granted or the discretionary decision to deny a departure for post-offense rehabilitation. <em>See United States v.. Dutcher, </em>8 F.3d 11, 12 (8th Cir.1993); <em>United States v. Correa, </em>167 F.3d 414, 417 (8th Cir.1999). We also reject Ploetz\u2019s <em>Apprendi </em>challenge, as imposition of the enhancements did not result in a sentence exceeding the statutory maximum authorized for his crimes. <em>See United States v. Aguayo-Delgado, </em>220 F.3d 926, 933 (8th <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"528\">*528</page-number>Cir.), <em>cert. denied, </em>\u2014 U.S.-, 121 S.Ct. 600, 148 L.Ed.2d 513 (2000).</p>\n<p id=\"b552-5\">Accordingly, we affirm.</p>\n<footnote label=\"1\">\n<p id=\"b551-20\">. The HONORABLE JOHN R. TUNHEIM, United States District Judge for the District of Minnesota.</p>\n</footnote>\n</opinion>\n</casebody>\n",
