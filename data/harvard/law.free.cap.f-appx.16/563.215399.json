Smith appeals the district court\u2019s <footnotemark>*</footnotemark> grant of summary judgment in favor of the Social Security Commissioner, affirming the denial of Smith\u2019s March 1997 application for disability insurance benefits after a hearing before an administrative law judge (ALJ), and after the Appeals Council denied review. Having reviewed <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"564\">*564</page-number>the record, we find the Commissioner\u2019s final decision is supported by substantial evidence on the record as a whole, including consideration of the new evidence submitted to the Appeals Council, to the extent the evidence related to the period before the ALJ\u2019s decision. <em>See Cunningham v. Apfel, </em>222 F.3d 496, 500 (8th Cir. 2000) (standard of review). In particular, the ALJ considered Smith\u2019s impairments in combination, permissibly discounted one treating physician\u2019s opinion and gave another treating physician\u2019s opinion controlling weight, made sufficient credibility findings, made a supported finding of no severe mental impairment, and did not fail to follow applicable regulations.</p>\n<p id=\"b588-4\">Accordingly, we affirm.</p>\n<p id=\"b588-5\">A true copy.</p>\n<footnote label=\"*\">\n<p id=\"b587-16\"> The Honorable Stephen M.
