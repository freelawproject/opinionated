Hammond claims that he was under the misimpression that his execution of a court-prepared consent form for the collection of fees from his prison account was sufficient to satisfy the fee requirement. Because it appears from the language of the consent form that Hammond\u2019s belief was reasonable, we vacate the district court\u2019s order dismissing his action and remand so that Hammond may have a reasonable period in which to remit the partial filing fee. We dispense with oral argument because the facts and legal contentions are adequately presented in the materials before the court and argument would not aid the decisional process.</p>\n<p id=\"b196-21\">\n<em>VACATED AND REMANDED.</em>\n</p>\n</opinion>\n</casebody>\n",
