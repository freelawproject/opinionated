The commission\u2019s order approved a stipulation signed by intervening appellee Dayton Power &amp; Light Company (\u201cDP&amp;L\u201d), Cargill, Inc., Honda of America Mfg., Inc., and intervening appellee Industrial Energy Users-Ohio.</p>\n<p id=\"b462-13\">Background</p>\n<p id=\"b462-14\">{\u00b6 2} The backdrop for this appeal is Am.Sub.S.B. No. 3, 148 Ohio Laws, Part IV, 7962 (\u201cSB 3\u201d), effective October 5, 1999, which provided for restructuring Ohio\u2019s electric-utility industry to achieve retail competition with respect to the generation component of electric service. SB 3 provided for a transition period, termed the \u201cmarket-development period,\u201d during which an electric utility\u2019s rates would be subject to certain regulatory requirements.</p>\n<p id=\"b462-15\">{\u00b6 3} As a result of the failure of competition to develop according to expectations, DP&amp;L filed an application in 2002 to extend its market-development period from December 31, 2003, through December 31, 2005. In September 2003, the commission approved a stipulation providing for the extension of DP&amp;L\u2019s market-development period (\u201cMDP-extension stipulation\u201d). In addition to extending the market-development period, the commission approved a three-year \u201crate-stabilization period,\u201d to begin immediately following the end of the market-development period and ending on December 31, 2008. <em>In re Continuation of </em><page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"341\">*341</page-number><em>Rate Freeze &amp; Extension of Market Dev. Period for Dayton Power &amp; Light Co. </em>(Sept. 2, 2003), PUCO No. 02-2779-EL-ATA, 2003 WL 22142843 (the \u201cMDP-extension case\u201d) at 13,19, 25.<footnotemark>1</footnotemark></p>\n<p id=\"b463-6\">{\u00b6 4} The order in the MDP-extension case also permitted DP&amp;L to collect, upon commission approval, a rate-stabilization surcharge of up to 11 percent of DP&amp;L\u2019s tariffed generation rates as of January 1, 2004. Id. at 28. The rate-stabilization surcharge was intended to allow DP&amp;L to recover generation-related cost increases for fuel, for environmental- and tax-law compliance, and for physical security and cyber security at plants owned by DP&amp;L and its affiliates. Id. at 27. The rate-stabilization surcharge was to be assessed on all customers in DP&amp;L\u2019s service territory, whether those customers purchased generation service from DP&amp;L or another supplier. Id. at 28. With respect to those customers not taking generation service from DP&amp;L, the rate-stabilization surcharge would act as a mechanism for the recovery of \u201cprovider-of-last-resort\u201d (\u201cPOLR\u201d) costs.<footnotemark>2</footnotemark> Id. The MDP-extension stipulation provided that DP&amp;L would seek approval of any rate-stabilization surcharge through an application filed pursuant to R.C. 4909.18. In <em>Constellation NewEnergy, Inc. v. Pub. Util. Comm., </em>104 Ohio St.3d 530, 2004Ohio-6767, 820 N.E.2d 885, we upheld the commission\u2019s approval of the MDP-extension stipulation.</p>\n<p id=\"b463-7\">{\u00b6 5} Pursuant to the order approving the MDP extension, DP&amp;L initiated this case by filing an application to increase rates through the implementation of the rate-stabilization surcharge. Several parties intervened in the case before the commission, including OCC, Cargill, Inc., Honda of America Mfg., Inc., and Industrial Energy Users-Ohio.</p>\n<p id=\"b463-8\">{\u00b6 6} After an investigation, the commission\u2019s staff filed a written report regarding DP&amp;L\u2019s requested rate increase. DP&amp;L, OCC, Cargill, Honda, and Industrial Energy Users-Ohio each filed objections to the staff report. A public hearing was held in Dayton on October 27, 2005.</p>\n<p id=\"b463-9\">{\u00b6 7} On November 3, 2005, DP&amp;L, Cargill, Honda, and Industrial Energy Users-Ohio filed a stipulation with the commission that, if accepted, would resolve all outstanding issues. Evidentiary hearings were held, and testimony was presented regarding DP&amp;L\u2019s rate-stabilization-surcharge application, the staff report, and the stipulation.</p>\n<p id=\"b464-4\"><page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"342\">*342</page-number>{\u00b6 8} On December 28, 2005, the commission issued its order approving the stipulation after making certain modifications. Among other things, the order extended DP&amp;L\u2019s rate-stabilization period from the end of 2008 through December 31, 2010. The commission authorized the implementation of an unavoidable rate-stabilization surcharge rider amounting to 11 percent of DP&amp;L\u2019s tariffed generation rates as of January 1, 2004. The commission also approved an environmental-investment rider, which was intended to allow DP&amp;L to recover \u201cenvironmental plant investments and incremental operations and maintenance, depreciation, and tax costs.\u201d The environmental-investment rider was set at 5.4 percent of DP&amp;L\u2019s 2004 tariffed generation rates and would increase by 5.4 percent of DP&amp;L\u2019s 2004 tariffed generation rates each year of the rate-stabilization period. Contrary to the terms proposed in the stipulation, the commission required that the entire environmental investment rider be avoidable by customers who shop during the rate-stabilization period. Finally, the commission approved a stipulation provision allowing DP&amp;L to collect the rate-stabilization surcharge through its distribution-service tariffs.<footnotemark>3</footnotemark></p>\n<p id=\"b464-5\">{\u00b6 9} OCC filed an application for rehearing, which was denied on February 22, 2006. OCC\u2019s appeal as of right is now before this court.</p>\n<p id=\"b464-6\">Collateral Estoppel</p>\n<p id=\"b464-7\">{\u00b6 10} OCC contends that the doctrine of collateral estoppel bars relitigation of the issues in the MDP-extension case. OCC asserts that the commission cannot approve the stipulation in this case because it alters the stipulation that was approved in the MDP-extension case, without the permission of the signatories to the first stipulation. We do not agree that the commission\u2019s decision amounted to a relitigation of previously determined issues and that the commission cannot change or modify earlier orders.</p>\n<p id=\"b464-8\">{\u00b6 11} The doctrine of collateral estoppel operates to \u201cpreclude the relitigation of a point of law or fact that was at issue in a former action between the same parties and was passed upon by a court of competent jurisdiction.\u201d <em>Consumers\u2019 Counsel v. Pub. Util. Comm. </em>(1985), 16 Ohio St.3d 9, 10, 16 OBR 361, 475 N.E.2d 782. Collateral estoppel has been applied to commission proceedings. Id.</p>\n<p id=\"b464-9\">{\u00b6 12} The doctrine is inapplicable here because there was no relitigation in this matter of a point of law or finding of fact that was passed upon by the commission in the MDP-extension case. The MDP-extension case approved, <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"343\">*343</page-number>among other things, a rate-stabilization surcharge of up to 11 percent of DP&amp;L\u2019s tariffed generation charges as of January 1, 2004. The rate-stabilization surcharge was intended to allow DP&amp;L to recover generation-related costs from increases in fuel prices, actions taken to comply with environmental and tax laws and physical and cyber security. The rate-stabilization surcharge was to be imposed in a rider on all customers, whether those customers purchased their generation from DP&amp;L or from another supplier. Finally, the surcharge was to be assessed only upon the commission\u2019s approval after DP&amp;L verified those increases in a subsequent application pursuant to R.C. 4909.18.</p>\n<p id=\"b465-5\">{\u00b6 13} This case, in contrast, concerns the amount DP&amp;L may charge through that rate-stabilization-surcharge rider. In the MDP-extension case, the commission approved the procedure that DP&amp;L needed to follow before it could collect a rate-stabilization surcharge and permitted DP&amp;L to recover certain increases in generation-related costs, subject to PUCO approval. And in this case, the commission determined that the rates that DP&amp;L set in the rate-stabilization-surcharge rider were reasonable and supported by the record, and it approved the surcharge. Thus, collateral estoppel is not applicable.</p>\n<p id=\"b465-6\">{\u00b6 14} OCC\u2019s argument that the commission erred in changing certain provisions of its previous order is without merit. The commission may change or modify earlier orders as long as it justifies any changes. <em>Consumers\u2019 Counsel v. Pub. Util. Comm. </em>(1984), 10 Ohio St.3d 49, 50-51, 10 OBR 312, 461 N.E.2d 303. The commission found that several important projections relied on by the MDP-extension stipulation had not in fact materialized and that that circumstance justified some modifications to its earlier order. The commission found that the competitive market in DP&amp;L\u2019s service territory had not developed as the commission had expected when it approved the MDP-extension stipulation. According to testimony at the hearing, only 0.03 percent of DP&amp;L\u2019s total load (representing seven small-business customers) had switched to a retail electric service provider not affiliated with DP&amp;L. The commission further noted that four rounds of competitive bidding were conducted in 2005 and that none of the rounds had produced a single bidder. Finally, the commission found that the record demonstrated that fuel and environmental costs vastly exceeded the commission\u2019s expectations at the time that the MDP-extension stipulation was approved.</p>\n<p id=\"b465-7\">{\u00b6 15} As a result, the commission determined that the stipulation in this case would benefit ratepayers and the public interest by protecting DP&amp;L\u2019s standard-service customers from price volatility and rate shock. The commission found that there was significant value in extending the rate-stabilization period for an additional two years to avoid unpredictable market rates in 2009 and 2010. The commission further found that the stipulation provided financial stability to <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"344\">*344</page-number>DP&amp;L by allowing it to recover its environmental-compliance costs, which exceed those anticipated at the time of the MDP-extension stipulation. Finally, the commission modified the stipulation by making the environmental-investment rider avoidable for the duration of the rate-stabilization period to better promote the development of competitive markets. In sum, the record supports the changes, and the commission explained its reasons for modifying its earlier order approving the MDP-extension stipulation. See <em>Ohio Consumers\u2019 Counsel v. Pub. Util. Comm., </em>110 Ohio St.3d 394, 2006-Ohio-4706, 853 N.E.2d 1153, at \u00b625.</p>\n<p id=\"b466-5\">{\u00b6 16} In light of the commission\u2019s authority to modify previous orders, the agreement of all signatories to the MDP-extension stipulation was not required. While the commission encourages agreement on issues, it is not bound to accept the terms of any stipulation. See <em>Akron v. Pub. Util. Comm. </em>(1978), 55 Ohio St.2d 155, 157, 9 O.O.3d 122, 378 N.E.2d 480. A stipulation presented to the commission is entitled to the force of law only if it is approved by an order of the commission. See, generally, <em>AK Steel Corp. v. Pub. Util. Comm. </em>(2002), 95 Ohio St.3d 81, 82-83, 765 N.E.2d 862; Ohio Adm.Code 4901-1-30(D). As explained above, the commission may change or modify earlier orders as long as it justifies any changes. Contrary to OCC\u2019s assertion, the MDP-extension stipulation was not modified unilaterally by DP&amp;L or Industrial Energy Users-Ohio, the only two parties who signed both the MDP-extension stipulation and the stipulation at issue in this appeal. Rather, the commission modified its earlier order in the MDP-extension case and sufficiently justified those changes. We therefore affirm the PUCO\u2019s determinations on these issues.</p>\n<p id=\"b466-6\">Generation-Service Tariffs versus Distribution-Service Tariffs</p>\n<p id=\"b466-7\">{\u00b6 17} OCC maintains that the commission erred when it approved a distribution-service rate increase to compensate DP&amp;L for costs that are purely generation-service costs. The commission\u2019s approval of the rate and amount is in conformity with applicable law. However, the commission erred in allowing DP&amp;L to recover generation costs through distribution-service tariffs.</p>\n<p id=\"b466-8\">{\u00b6 18} In the MDP-extension stipulation in 2003, DP&amp;L proposed a rate-stabilization surcharge, which was intended to allow DP&amp;L to increase rates in order to recover increases in generation-related costs for fuel, for actions taken in compliance with environmental and tax laws and for physical security and cyber security. These increased costs were to be collected from all customers, whether they purchased generation service from DP&amp;L or from another supplier. With respect to those customers who do not take generation service from DP&amp;L, the rate-stabilization surcharge would compensate DP&amp;L for the risks and costs that DP&amp;L will incur as a POLR. See R.C. 4928.14(C).</p>\n<p id=\"b466-9\">{\u00b6 19} In this case, the commission approved a provision of the stipulation that allowed DP&amp;L to place the rate-stabilization-surcharge rider in the company\u2019s <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"345\">*345</page-number>distribution-service tariffs. Objections were made to the commission that the rate-stabilization surcharge is a generation charge that should not be placed in the distribution-service tariffs. The commission rejected these arguments and found that it was reasonable to place the rate-stabilization surcharge in the distribution-service tariffs because, like distribution rates, the surcharge would be charged to all customers in DP&amp;L\u2019s service territory. According to the commission, this result would reduce confusion as to whether the rate-stabilization surcharge was avoidable by customers who were not receiving generation service from DP&amp;L.</p>\n<p id=\"b467-6\">{\u00b6 20} OCC claims that placement of the rate-stabilization surcharge in a distribution-service-tariff rider for collection violates the clear intent of Ohio\u2019s electric-industry-restructuring legislation. OCC argues that it is contrary to Ohio law and policy that five years into electric-industry restructuring, the commission is essentially rebundling generation and distribution components.</p>\n<p id=\"b467-7\">{\u00b6 21} The commission\u2019s decision in this case did not address whether the placement of generation-related charges in distribution-service-tariff riders violates the provisions of SB 3. The commission merely adopted the finding of the staff report that because the rate-stabilization surcharge is unavoidable, its placement in the distribution-service tariffs was reasonable. However, a commission staff witness testified that the parties who have objected to the placement of the rate-stabilization surcharge in distribution-service-tariff riders were \u201ctechnically correct.\u201d This witness further testified that \u201c[wjhile staff is indifferent as to the placement of the [rate-stabilization surcharge] Rider, it is clearly generation-related and, in theory, belongs in the Generation tariffs.\u201d</p>\n<p id=\"b467-8\">{\u00b6 22} The cornerstone of SB 3 was the requirement that electric utilities unbundle the three major components of electric service \u2014 generation, distribution, and transmission. See R.C. 4928.31(A)(1) and 4928.34(A)(1) through (7). Before generation-service competition began under SB 3, customers received and paid for the three major components of electric service on a bundled basis. That is, the three components were priced as one, and electric utilities used the revenues from the bundled electric services to support their generation, transmission, and distribution expenses and investments. With the advent of customer choice of electric-generation service under SB 3, \u201cit became necessary for electric utilities to unbundle the three service components and their own components, so that customers could evaluate offers from competitive generators.\u201d See <em>Migden-Ostrander v. Pub. Util. Comm,., </em>102 Ohio St.3d 451, 2004-Ohio-3924, 812 N.E.2d 955, at \u00b6 3-4.</p>\n<p id=\"b467-9\">{\u00b6 23} The PUCO acknowledges that SB 3 required that rates be separated into separate generation-, transmission-, and distribution-service components. The PUCO also concedes that there is an ongoing requirement under SB 3 that <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"346\">*346</page-number>competitive retail electric services be unbundled, i.e., priced separately, to aid customers in comparison shopping. See R.C. 4928.07.</p>\n<p id=\"b468-5\">{\u00b6 24} However, the PUCO contends that SB 3 was not violated in this instance, because this case does not involve a competitive service. The rate-stabilization-surcharge rider is intended, in part, to pay DP&amp;L for costs associated with its POLR obligations. The PUCO maintains that the POLR obligation is a distribution-service function because only an electric-distribution utility, such as DP&amp;L, can provide this service. It is unclear why the generation costs should not be placed into the generation-service tariffs.</p>\n<p id=\"b468-6\">{\u00b6 25} The commission itself amended the stipulation in this case so that a portion of DP&amp;L\u2019s POLR costs are avoidable by shopping customers. As originally contemplated in the MDP-extension case, DP&amp;L would collect POLR costs \u2014 including fuel and generation-related environmental cost increases\u2014 through the rate-stabilization surcharge. In the stipulation in this case, DP&amp;L split the rate-stabilization <em>surcharge </em>into two separate components: (1) a rate-stabilization <em>charge </em>to recover fuel costs and (2) an environmental-investment rider to recover environmental costs. The commission required that the entire environmental-investment rider be avoidable by customers who purchase generation service from a provider other than DP&amp;L.</p>\n<p id=\"b468-7\">{\u00b6 26} We find that the evidence supports including actual generation costs in the generation-service tariffs. The commission\u2019s own expert on staff testified that it is technically appropriate under SB 3 to put the rate-stabilization charge in the generation-service tariffs. We share OCC\u2019s concern that once the industry moves past the rate-stabilization phase, the distinction between generation and distribution in the tariffs and rate structures will be too blurred to effectively apply SB 3. Likewise, counsel for the commission represented at oral argument that including the charge in distribution-service tariffs instead of in generation-service tariffs was essentially a distinction without a difference, meaning that the appropriate generation charges could be recorded in the generation tariffs without a problem. Accordingly, the PUCO\u2019s order is affirmed with regard to the amount of the charge but is reversed with regard to the placement of the charge in the distribution-service tariffs. We remand the matter to the commission to order DP&amp;L to place the appropriate generation charges in the generation-service tariffs. We point out that while we have affirmed the commission\u2019s order with regard to the POLR costs in this and previous cases, the commission should carefully consider what costs it is attributing as costs incurred as part of an electric-distribution utility\u2019s POLR obligations.</p>\n<p id=\"b468-8\">Public Interest</p>\n<p id=\"b468-9\">{\u00b6 27} We deny OCC\u2019s claim that the commission approved a settlement that does not benefit ratepayers and the public interest. OCC contends that the <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"347\">*347</page-number>commission ignored evidence regarding the unfavorable rate impact the stipulation would have on residential customers in comparison to the provisions found in the stipulation approved in the MDP-extension case.</p>\n<p id=\"b469-6\">{\u00b6 28} The commission did not ignore the evidence offered by OCC; the commission rejected it. The commission found that the projected market rates offered by the OCC witness were unreliable. The commission determined that price stability was of higher value in a developing market. Specifically, the commission concluded that \u201cthe value of extending stable, predictable rates through 2010 is a significant benefit to ratepayers and the public interest and that such value outweighs the burden of the increased rates.\u201d</p>\n<p id=\"b469-7\">{\u00b6 29} In light of the commission\u2019s consideration of the evidence, it appears that OCC is asking this court to reweigh the evidence and substitute its judgment for that of the commission. OCC has not shown that the commission\u2019s findings here are manifestly against the weight of the evidence, and this court will not second-guess the commission on questions of fact absent such a showing. See <em>Cincinnati Gas &amp; Elec. Co. v. Pub. Util. Comm. </em>(1999), 86 Ohio St.3d 53, 58, 711 N.E.2d 670; <em>Cincinnati v. Pub. Util. Comm. </em>(1993), 67 Ohio St.3d 523, 528-529, 620 N.E.2d 826. We therefore affirm the PUCO\u2019s determinations on this issue.</p>\n<p id=\"b469-8\">Side Agreements</p>\n<p id=\"b469-9\">{\u00b6 30} OCC argues that the stipulation is unlawful because DP&amp;L enticed Cargill and Honda to sign the stipulation by offering them, in a side agreement, better terms than the stipulation provides to other customers in the same situation. We do not agree. Specifically, OCC\u2019s claim revolves around two \u201cside agreements\u201d whereby DP&amp;L offered to waive a tariff provision for Honda and Cargill that required 60 days\u2019 notice to return to DP&amp;L\u2019s standard service. Under these agreements, Honda and Cargill could return to DP&amp;L for generation service with 30 days\u2019 notice. According to OCC, these agreements amount to discriminatory and preferential treatment of Cargill and Honda.</p>\n<p id=\"b469-10\">{\u00b6 31} However, a DP&amp;L witness testified before the commission that DP&amp;L would extend this offer to any similarly situated customer. Thus, OCC\u2019s claim that the waiver was applied in a discriminatory manner is not supported by the record. In addition, contrary to OCC\u2019s assertion, the waiver does not appear to be anticompetitive, because a shorter notice period gives customers more time to shop for another generation provider. Moreover, OCC cannot show harm to residential customers, because evidence before the commission indicated that no residential customer in DP&amp;L\u2019s service territory had switched to a competitive generation provider unaffiliated with DP&amp;L. Thus, there would be no reason for residential customers to ask for a shorter notice period to return to DP&amp;L for generation service.</p>\n<p id=\"b470-3\"><page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"348\">*348</page-number>{\u00b6 32} OCC also argues that the commission erred when it denied its motion to admit the side agreements into evidence. Despite the commission\u2019s conclusion that the side agreements were not relevant, it is clear from the record that the commission did review the side agreements. In fact, the commission allowed OCC to question a DP&amp;L witness on the nature and intent of the side agreements. Thus, the commission\u2019s exclusion of this evidence did not prejudice OCC. See, e.g., <em>Ohio Consumers\u2019 Counsel v. Pub. Util. Comm., </em>Ill Ohio St.3d 384, 2006-Ohio-5853, 856 N.E.2d 940, at \u00b6 22 (denial of motion to intervene did not prejudice OCC when commission took OCC\u2019s filings into consideration). Accordingly, OCC\u2019s arguments relating to side agreements and discriminatory behavior are not well taken.</p>\n<p id=\"b470-4\">Voluntary-Enrollment Procedure</p>\n<p id=\"b470-5\">{\u00b6 33} The commission\u2019s decision on the voluntary-enrollment procedure was not unlawful, unreasonable, or against the manifest weight of the evidence.</p>\n<p id=\"b470-6\">{\u00b6 34} The voluntary-enrollment procedure was set out in the MDP-extension stipulation as one part of the proposed alternative to the competitive-bidding requirement of R.C. 4928.14(B). In addition to the voluntary-enrollment procedure, DP&amp;L\u2019s proposed alternative to competitive bidding (1) established a market-based standard-service offer with price monitoring by the commission to ensure that rates would remain market-based over time and (2) allowed the commission to end the rate-stabilization period if the market rates do not reflect the rates established in the stipulation. In <em>Constellation NewEnergy, </em>104 Ohio St.3d 530, 2004-Ohio-6767, 820 N.E.2d 885, at \u00b6 44-49, we held that these provisions complied with R.C. 4928.14(B).</p>\n<p id=\"b470-7\">{\u00b6 35} OCC argued that the voluntary-enrollment procedure should be extended beyond the commission-approved extension through 2007 to cover the remaining years of the rate-stabilization period.</p>\n<p id=\"b470-8\">{\u00b6 36} The commission has the authority, under R.C. 4928.14(B), to \u201cdetermine at any time that a competitive bidding process is not required, if other means to accomplish generally the same option for customers is readily available in the market and a reasonable means for customer participation is developed.\u201d In this case, the commission required that the voluntary-enrollment procedure be conducted in 2006 and 2007 in the same manner as in 2005. The alternative-to-bidding provisions of the MDP-extension stipulation \u2014 commission price monitoring of the market-based standard-service offer and ending the rate-stabilization period if market rates are lower than stipulation rates \u2014 remain in effect under the stipulation approved by the PUCO in the instant case. The OCC\u2019s claim that the program would be more effective in the later stages of the rate-stabilization period is speculative. The commission noted in its order that in 2005, there were four rounds of competitive bidding conducted under the voluntary-enrollment <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"349\">*349</page-number>procedure and that none of the rounds of competitive bidding produced a single bidder. Finally, the commission made the environmental-investment rider avoidable for the duration of the rate-stabilization period for those who shop, in order to further promote competition.</p>\n<p id=\"b471-5\">{\u00b6 37} In sum, competitive bidding will be held after the market-development period, as R.C. 4928.14(B) requires. In addition, the commission-approved stipulation provided other means to accomplish generally the same option as a competitive bid (monitoring the standard-service offer to ensure that it is market based) and also provided a reasonable means of customer participation (conducting the voluntary-enrollment procedure in 2006 and 2007, and providing shopping incentives).</p>\n<p id=\"b471-6\">{\u00b6 38} OCC has not shown that the commission\u2019s decision regarding the voluntary-enrollment procedure was unlawful, unreasonable, or against the manifest weight of the evidence. We therefore affirm the commission\u2019s determination.</p>\n<p id=\"b471-7\">Three-Part Test for Settlements</p>\n<p id=\"b471-8\">{\u00b6 39} OCC urges this court to revisit <em>Consumers\u2019 Counsel v. Pub. Util. Comm. </em>(1992), 64 Ohio St.3d 123, 592 N.E.2d 1370, which endorsed the commission\u2019s use of the three-part reasonableness test for reviewing settlement stipulations. We decline to consider this argument due to OCC\u2019s failure to preserve the issue on appeal.</p>\n<p id=\"b471-9\">{\u00b6 40} OCC waived this issue by not setting it forth in its application for rehearing. R.C. 4903.10 provides that an application for rehearing \u201cshall be in writing and shall set forth specifically the ground or grounds on which the applicant considers the order to be unreasonable or unlawful. No party shall in any court urge or rely on any ground for reversal, vacation, or modification not so set forth in the application.\u201d We have held that setting forth specific grounds for rehearing is a jurisdictional prerequisite for review. <em>Consumers\u2019 Counsel v. Pub. Util. Comm. </em>(1994), 70 Ohio St.3d 244, 247, 638 N.E.2d 550. OCC also failed to set forth this specific issue in its notice of appeal to this court, and this failure precludes our considering the issue. R.C. 4903.13; <em>Cincinnati Gas &amp; Elec. Co. v. Pub. Util. Comm., </em>103 Ohio St.3d 398, 2004-Ohio-5466, 816 N.E.2d 238, at \u00b6 21. Therefore, OCC\u2019s argument is rejected.</p>\n<p id=\"b471-10\">Conclusion</p>\n<p id=\"b471-11\">{\u00b6 41} R.C. 4903.13 provides that a PUCO order shall be reversed, vacated, or modified by this court only when, upon consideration of the record, the court finds that the order is unlawful or unreasonable. For the reasons explained above, we hold that all but one of OCC\u2019s propositions of law fail to establish that the commission\u2019s order was unlawful or unreasonable. We remand the case to the commission to issue an order that DP&amp;L adjust the location of appropriate <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"350\">*350</page-number>generation charges from distribution-service tariffs to generation-service tariffs. Finally, as we continue to see the rate-stabilization plans appealed from the commission, we presume that the commission is sharing its evaluations and reports on the effectiveness of competition with the legislature, as mandated by R.C. 4928.06(C), so that it can continue to evaluate the need for further legislative action.</p>\n<attorneys id=\"AOcM\">Janine L.
