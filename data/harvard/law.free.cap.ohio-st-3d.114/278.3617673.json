For the following reasons, we reverse the judgment of the court of appeals.</p>\n<p id=\"b401-9\">{\u00b6 2} Appellee, Paul Tellings, a resident of the city of Toledo, owned three dogs identified as pit bulls. Tellings was charged by the city for violating Toledo Municipal Code 505.14(a) and R.C. 955.22. The Toledo Municipal Code limits ownership of vicious dogs, as defined in R.C. 955.11, or dogs commonly known as pit bulls or pit bull mixed breeds, to one in each household, and the Ohio Revised Code requires an owner of a pit bull to obtain liability insurance for damages, injuries, or death that might be caused by the dog.</p>\n<p id=\"b401-10\">{\u00b6 3} Tellings challenged the constitutionality of Toledo Municipal Code 505.14(a) and R.C. 955.22 and 955.11(A)(4)(a)(iii), which includes pit bull in the definition of \u201cvicious dog.\u201d The trial court conducted a hearing on appellee\u2019s motion, and several witnesses testified for both parties regarding the traits and characteristics of pit bulls. The court found that as a breed, pit bulls are not more dangerous than other breeds but that the evidence supported the city\u2019s claim that pit bulls present dangers in an urban setting.</p>\n<p id=\"b401-11\">{\u00b6 4} The trial court found that property rights are subject to a government\u2019s police powers. The court stated: \u201cThe fact that such legislation may have an adverse effect on a segment of the dog population not presenting a danger to the public does not make the legislation overbroad. Legislation will only be considered overbroad if it is applicable to conduct protecting a fundamental constitutional right * * * and this does not include the category of ownership of dogs.\u201d The court found that Tellings\u2019s evidence did not prove beyond a reasonable doubt that Toledo Municipal Code 505.14 was unconstitutional.<footnotemark>1</footnotemark></p>\n<p id=\"b401-12\">{\u00b6 5} In a split decision, the court of appeals reversed the trial court, holding that R.C. 955.11 and 955.22 and Toledo Municipal Code 505.14 were unconstitutional. <em>Toledo v. Tellings, </em>Lucas App. L-04-1224, 2006-Ohio-975, 2006 WL <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"280\">*280</page-number>513946. The court of appeals held that the three laws violated the right to procedural due process, substantive due process, and equal protection, as guaranteed by the Fourteenth Amendment to the United States Constitution and Section 16, Article I of the Ohio Constitution, and were void for vagueness.</p>\n<p id=\"b402-4\">{\u00b6 6} First, relying on the rationale of <em>State v. Cowan, </em>103 Ohio St.3d 144, 2004-Ohio-4777, 814 N.E.2d 846, the court of appeals held that R.C. 955.11 and 955.22 and Toledo Municipal Code 505.14 were unconstitutional because the three laws violated procedural due process. In <em>Cowan, </em>we held that \u201cR.C. 955.22 violates the constitutional right to procedural due process insofar as it failed to provide dog owners a meaningful opportunity to be heard on the issue of whether a dog is \u2018vicious\u2019 or \u2018dangerous\u2019 as defined in R.C. 955.11(A)(1)(a) and (A)(4)(a).\u201d Id. at syllabus. In this case, the court of appeals held that because Tellings did not \u201chave an opportunity under [R.C. 955.22] to offer evidence that his pit bulls were not vicious in order to refute the charges,\u201d <em>Tellings, </em>2006-Ohio-975, 2006 WL 513946, at \u00b6 48, the laws were unconstitutional.</p>\n<p id=\"b402-5\">{\u00b6 7} The court of appeals also held that the laws violated Tellings\u2019s rights to equal protection and substantive due process because, once the trial court had determined that the American Pit Bull terrier was not inherently dangerous, the laws were not rationally related to a legitimate state interest. The court of appeals stated that the evidence presented at the trial court had disproved the presumption that pit bulls are inherently dangerous.</p>\n<p id=\"b402-6\">{\u00b6 8} Finally, the court of appeals held that the three laws were unconstitutional because they were void for vagueness. The court of appeals stated that it was \u201ctroubled by the lack of an exact statutory definition of \u2018pit bull\u2019 \u201d and the \u201chighly subjective nature of the identification process.\u201d <em>Tellings, </em>2006-Ohio-975, 2006 WL 513946, at \u00b6 73.</p>\n<p id=\"b402-7\">{\u00b6 9} We accepted discretionary review to consider the constitutionality of R.C. 955.11 and 955.22 and Toledo Municipal Code 505.14.</p>\n<p id=\"b402-8\">{\u00b6 10} R.C. 955.11 states:</p>\n<p id=\"b402-9\">{\u00b6 11} \u201c(A) As used in this section:</p>\n<p id=\"b402-10\">{\u00b6 12} \u201c * * *</p>\n<p id=\"b402-11\">{\u00b6 13} \u201c(4)(a) Wicious dog\u2019 means a dog that, without provocation and subject to division (A)(4)(b) of this section, meets any of the following:</p>\n<p id=\"b402-12\">{\u00b6 14} \u201c(i) Has killed or caused serious injury to any person;</p>\n<p id=\"b402-13\">{\u00b6 15} \u201c(ii) Has caused injury, other than killing or serious injury, to any person, or has killed another dog.</p>\n<p id=\"b402-14\">{\u00b6 16} \u201c(iii) Belongs to a breed that is commonly known as a pit bull dog. The ownership, keeping, or harboring of such a breed of dog shall be prima-facie evidence of the ownership, keeping, or harboring of a vicious dog.\u201d</p>\n<p id=\"b403-5\"><page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"281\">*281</page-number>{\u00b6 17} R.C. 955.22(A) states:</p>\n<p id=\"b403-6\">{\u00b6 18} \u201cAs used in this section, \u2018dangerous dog\u2019 and .\u2018vicious dog\u2019 have the same meanings as in section 955.11 of the Revised Code.\u201d</p>\n<p id=\"b403-7\">{\u00b6 19} Toledo Municipal Code 505.14(a) states:</p>\n<p id=\"b403-8\">{\u00b6 20} \u201c(a) No person or organization or corporation shall own, keep, harbor or provide sustenance for more than one vicious dog, as defined by Ohio R.C. 955.11, or a dog commonly known as a Pit Bull or Pit Bull mixed breed dog, regardless of age, in the City of Toledo, with the exception of puppies commonly known as Pit Bull or Pit Bull mixed breed for which the owner has filed an ownership acknowledgement form in person with the Dog Warden of Lucas County, prior to reaching seven (7) days of age. The ownership of these puppies must be transferred according to Ohio R.C. 955.11 before they are three (3) months of age. Additionally, this section requires that all vicious dogs, as described in the Ohio Revised Code, or dogs commonly known as Pit Bull or Pit Bull mixed breed dogs are required, when off the owners\u2019 premises, to be securely confined as described in Ohio R.C. 955.22 and muzzled.\u201d</p>\n<p id=\"b403-9\">{\u00b6 21} Our resolution of the issue presented turns on whether the statutes and the ordinance in question are valid exercises of police power by the state and the city. If R.C. 955.11 and 955.22 and Toledo Municipal Code 505.14 are rationally related to a legitimate interest of the state and the city in the public\u2019s health, safety, morals, or general welfare, they are constitutional. See <em>Benjamin v. Columbus </em>(1957), 167 Ohio St. 103, 4 O.O.2d 113, 146 N.E.2d 854, at paragraph five of the syllabus.</p>\n<p id=\"b403-10\">{\u00b6 22} We begin with the well-established legal principle that \u201c \u2018[t]he legislature is the primary judge of the needs of public welfare, and this court will not nullify the decision of the legislature except in the case of a clear violation of a state or federal constitutional provision. <em>Williams v. Scudder </em>(1921), 102 Ohio St. 305, 131 N.E. 481, paragraphs three and four of the syllabus.\u2019 \u201d <em>Beagle v. Walden </em>(1997), 78 Ohio St.3d 59, 61, 676 N.E.2d 506, quoting <em>Savoie v. Grange Mut. Ins. Co. </em>(1993), 67 Ohio St.3d 500, 515, 620 N.E.2d 809 (Moyer, C.J., dissenting).</p>\n<p id=\"b403-11\">{\u00b6 23} The Ohio Constitution provides for the exercise of state and local police power in derogation of the right to hold private property. Section 19, Article I of the Ohio Constitution states: \u201cPrivate property shall ever be held inviolate, but subservient to the public welfare.\u201d \u201cAs a result of this subordination, police power regulations are upheld although they may interfere with the enjoyment of liberty or the acquisition, possession and production of private property.\u201d <em>State v. Anderson </em>(1991), 57 Ohio St.3d 168, 170, 566 N.E.2d 1224. Section 3, Article XVIII of the Ohio Constitution provides: \u201cMunicipalities shall have authority to exercise all powers of local self-government and to adopt and enforce within their <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"282\">*282</page-number>limits such local police, sanitary and other similar regulations, as are not in conflict with general laws.\u201d</p>\n<p id=\"b404-4\">{\u00b6 24} \u201cAmong the regulations which have been upheld as legitimate exercises of police power are those regulations addressing the ownership and control of dogs.\u201d <em>Anderson, </em>57 Ohio St.3d at 170, 566 N.E.2d 1224. Despite the special relationships that exist between many people and their dogs, dogs are personal property, and the state or the city has the right to control those that are a threat to the safety of the community: \u201cAlthough dogs are private property to a qualified extent, they are subject to the state police power, and \u2018might be destroyed or otherwise dealt with, as in the judgment of the legislature is necessary for the protection of its citizens.\u2019 * * * [Legislatures have broad police power to regulate all dogs so as to protect the public against the nuisance posed by a vicious dog.\u201d Id., citing <em>Sentell v. New Orleans &amp; Carrollton RR. Co. </em>(1897), 166 U.S. 698, 17 S.Ct. 693, 41 L.Ed. 1169.</p>\n<p id=\"b404-5\">{\u00b6 25} The state and the city have a legitimate interest in protecting citizens against unsafe conditions caused by pit bulls. We note that substantial reputable evidence was presented at the trial court by both parties: the parties produced 18 witnesses, dozens of exhibits were admitted into evidence, and more than 1,000 pages of testimony were taken. The trial court found that there is little evidence that pit bulls are a dangerous breed when trained and adapted in a social situation and that there is no evidence that pit bulls bite more frequently than other breeds of dogs. However, the trial court correctly noted that its finding that pit bulls are not inherently dangerous does not necessarily lead to the conclusion that the laws at issue are unconstitutional. Rather, the evidence was evaluated to determine whether pit bulls were associated with problem circumstances.</p>\n<p id=\"b404-6\">{\u00b6 26} The trial court cited the substantial evidence supporting its conclusion that pit bulls, compared to other breeds, cause a disproportionate amount of danger to people. The chief dog warden of Lucas County testified that (1) when pit bulls attack, they are more likely to inflict severe damage to their victim than other breeds of dogs, (2) pit bulls have killed more Ohioans than any other breed of dog, (3) Toledo police officers fire their weapons in the line of duty at pit bulls more often than they fire weapons at people and all other breeds of dogs combined, and (4) pit bulls are frequently shot during drug raids because pit bulls are encountered more frequently in drug raids than any other dog breed. The trial court also found that pit bulls are \u201cfound largely in urban settings where there are crowded living conditions and a large number of children present,\u201d which increases the risk of injury caused by pit bulls.</p>\n<p id=\"b404-7\">{\u00b6 27} The evidence presented in the trial court supports the conclusion that pit bulls pose a serious danger to the safety of citizens. The state and the city <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"283\">*283</page-number>have a legitimate interest in protecting citizens from the danger posed by this breed of domestic dogs.</p>\n<p id=\"b405-4\">{\u00b6 28} The statutes and the city ordinance are rationally related to serve the legitimate interests of protecting Ohio and Toledo citizens. R.C. 955.11(A)(4)(a)(iii) states that \u201cvicious dog\u201d includes a dog that \u201c[b]elongs to a breed that is commonly known as a pit bull dog\u201d and that owning, keeping, or harboring a pit bull is prima facie evidence of owning, keeping, or harboring a vicious dog. In view of the unique problems posed by pit bulls in this state, the General Assembly requires owners of pit bulls, like owners of vicious dogs, to meet certain statutory requirements. In R.C. 955.22(E), all persons having vicious dogs are required to obtain liability insurance, and under R.C. 955.22(F), vicious dogs cannot be surgically silenced. These requirements are rationally related to the state\u2019s interest in protecting its citizens from pit bulls and in assuring those who are injured by a pit bull that they will be compensated for their injuries.</p>\n<p id=\"b405-5\">{\u00b6 29} Toledo Municipal Code 505.14 limits ownership to one pit bull per person, organization, or corporation, and requires that pit bulls be muzzled when not on the owner\u2019s premises. The limitation and requirement are rationally related to the city\u2019s interest in protecting its citizens from harm caused by pit bulls. In addition to the evidence cited above, the chief dog warden testified that an encounter with two aggressive dogs is much worse than an encounter with one aggressive dog because dogs in a pack are more likely to have increased aggressive behavior and act on predatory instincts.</p>\n<p id=\"b405-6\">{\u00b6 30} The court of appeals found R.C. 955.11 and 955.22 and Toledo Municipal Code 505.14 unconstitutional with respect to procedural due process, substantive due process, and equal protection, and under the void-for-vagueness doctrine. We disagree.</p>\n<p id=\"b405-7\">{\u00b6 31} First, the court of appeals declared that the laws violated procedural due process pursuant to <em>State v. Cowan, </em>103 Ohio St.3d 144, 2004-Ohio-4777, 814 N.E.2d 846. In <em>Cowan, </em>a Portage County deputy dog warden determined two dogs to be vicious following a complaint that the dogs had attacked a woman. Id. at \u00b6 1. The dogs were determined to be vicious because of the alleged attack, not because they were pit bulls. We held that when a dog is determined to be \u201cvicious\u201d under R.C. 955.11(A)(4)(a), procedural due process requires that the owner have notice and an opportunity to be heard before the owner is charged with a crime. Id. at \u00b6 13.</p>\n<p id=\"b405-8\">{\u00b6 32} In <em>Cowan, </em>the dogs were determined to be vicious under the first two subsections of R.C. 955.11(A)(4)(a) because they had caused injury to a person. Thus, the case concerned the dog warden\u2019s unilateral classification of the dogs as vicious. However, in this case, the \u201cvicious dogs\u201d at issue are those classified as <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"284\">*284</page-number>pit bulls under the third subsection of R.C. 955.11(A)(4)(a). Unlike the situation in <em>Cowan, </em>the General Assembly has classified pit bulls generally as vicious; there is no concern about unilateral administrative decision-making on a case-by-case basis. The clear statutory language alerts all owners of pit bulls that failure to abide by the laws related to vicious dogs and pit bulls is a crime. Therefore, the laws do not violate the rights of pit bull owners to procedural due process.</p>\n<p id=\"b406-5\">{\u00b6 33} Second, R.C. 955.11 and 955.22 and Toledo Municipal Code 505.14 are not unconstitutional for violating substantive due process or equal protection rights. Laws limiting rights, other than fundamental rights, are constitutional with respect to substantive due process and equal protection if the laws are rationally related to a legitimate goal of government. See <em>State v. Thompkins </em>(1996), 75 Ohio St.3d 558, 560-561, 664 N.E.2d 926. As we discussed previously when evaluating whether the statutes and ordinance in question are valid exercises of state and city police power, R.C. 955.11 and 955.22 and Toledo Municipal Code 505.14 are rationally related to a legitimate government interest.</p>\n<p id=\"b406-6\">{\u00b6 34} Finally, the court of appeals erred in holding that R.C. 955.11 and 955.22 and Toledo Municipal Code 505.14 are void for vagueness. This court has previously held that the term \u201cpit bull\u201d is not unconstitutionally void for vagueness. In <em>State v. Anderson, </em>we stated: \u201cIn sum, we believe that the physical and behavioral traits of pit bulls together with the commonly available knowledge of dog breeds typically acquired by potential dog owners or otherwise possessed by veterinarians or breeders are sufficient to inform a dog owner as to whether he owns a dog commonly known as a pit bull dog.\u201d 57 Ohio St.3d 168, 173, 566 N.E.2d 1224.</p>\n<p id=\"b406-7\">{\u00b6 35} In conclusion, the state and the city of Toledo possess the constitutional authority to exercise police powers that are rationally related to a legitimate interest in public health, safety, morals, or general welfare. Here, evidence proves that pit bulls cause more damage than other dogs when they attack, cause more fatalities in Ohio than other dogs, and cause Toledo police officers to fire their weapons more often than people or other breeds of dogs cause them to fire their weapons. We hold that the state of Ohio and the city of Toledo have a legitimate interest in protecting citizens from the dangers associated with pit bulls, and that R.C. 955.11(A)(4)(a)(iii) and 955.22 and Toledo Municipal Code 505.14 are rationally related to that interest and are constitutional.</p>\n<p id=\"b406-8\">{\u00b6 36} For the foregoing reasons the judgment of the court of appeals is reversed.</p>\n<p id=\"b406-9\">Judgment reversed.</p>\n<judges id=\"b406-10\">Pfeifer, Lundberg Stratton, O\u2019Donnell, Lanzinger and Cupp, JJ., concur.</judges>\n<judges id=\"b406-11\">O\u2019Connor, J., concurs in judgment only.</judges>\n<attorneys id=\"AM_\"><page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"285\">*285</page-number>John T.

The trial court found only Toledo Municipal Code 505.14 constitutional, which was the law specifically challenged in <em>the </em>caption of Tellings\u2019s motion to dismiss, though he did argue the constitutionality of Toledo Municipal Code 505.14 and R.C. 955.11 and 955.22 in the action. When reviewing the decision of the trial court, the court of appeals reviewed the constitutionality of all three laws.</p>\n</footnote>\n</opinion>\n<opinion data-order=\"6\" data-type=\"opinion\" id=\"x999-2\" type=\"concurrence\">\n<author id=\"b407-5\"><page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"285\">*285</page-number>O\u2019Connor, J.,</author>\n<p id=\"ATT\">concurring in judgment only.</p>\n<p id=\"b407-6\">{\u00b6 37} I concur in judgment only to emphasize my disapproval of R.C. 955.11(A)(4)(a)(iii), which identifies pit bulls as vicious animals per se.</p>\n<p id=\"b407-7\">{\u00b6 38} Breed-specific prohibitions, limitations, and restrictions are justified by labeling dogs as \u201cinherently dangerous\u201d by virtue of the particular breed\u2019s alleged characteristics. Contrary to that assumption, dangerous animal behavior is the function of inherently dangerous dog owners, not inherently dangerous dogs.</p>\n<p id=\"b407-8\">{\u00b6 39} The statistics offered at trial in this case may support a correlation between pit bulls and the frequency and severity of injuries they cause to people in urban settings, but they do not establish the conclusion that pit bulls must necessarily pose a danger. Indeed, experts in the canine field who rate the temperament of different breeds of dogs conclude that pit bulls have a better temperament than many other common breeds of dogs used as pets, including the miniature poodle and Shih-Tzu. See Karyn Grey, Breed-Specific Legislation Revisited: Canine Racism or the Answer to Florida\u2019s Dog Control Problems? (2003), 27 Nova L.Rev. 415, 436, and fns. 147 and 148.</p>\n<p id=\"b407-9\">{\u00b6 40} A more thorough analysis of the dynamic would demonstrate that the danger posed is the result of some dog owners, including drug dealers, who deliberately increase the dog\u2019s aggression and lethality through abuse or other specific methods of training. Other owners simply fail to properly train and supervise the animal, thereby creating dangerous behavior by the dog.</p>\n<p id=\"b407-10\">{\u00b6 41} Almost all domestic animals can cause significant injuries to humans, and it is proper to require that all domestic animals be maintained and controlled. Laws to that effect are eminently reasonable for the safety of citizens and of the animal. Because the danger posed by vicious dogs and pit bulls arises from the owner\u2019s failure to safely control the animal, rational legislation should focus on the owner of the dog rather than the specific breed that is owned.</p>\n<attorneys id=\"APV\"><page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"286\">*286</page-number>Robert J.
