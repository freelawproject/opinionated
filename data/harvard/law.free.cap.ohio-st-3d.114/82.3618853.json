It found its judgment to be in conflict with the judgment of the Eighth District Court of Appeals in <em>Preferred Capital, Inc. v. Strellec, </em>161 Ohio App.3d 346, 2005-Ohio-2607, 830 N.E.2d 403. The certified question is \u201c[wjhether a dismissal other than on the merits which prevents re-filing in the trial court is a final, appealable order.\u201d For the reasons that follow, we conclude that such a dismissal is a final, appealable order.</p>\n<p id=\"b204-10\">{\u00b6 2} Appellants are various small businesses, nonprofit organizations, and associated individuals located in states other than Ohio. These entities contracted with NorVergence, Inc., a New Jersey telecommunications company, for landline, cellular telephone, and high-speed Internet services. The contracts included five-year equipment rentals for the hardware necessary to access the various services. NorVergence assigned appellants\u2019 contracts to appellee, National City Commercial Capital Corporation (\u201cNational City\u201d). After the contracts were assigned, NorVergence failed to provide the services it had agreed to provide.</p>\n<p id=\"b204-11\">{\u00b6 3} NorVergence was forced into bankruptcy by its creditors. Many of NorVergence\u2019s customers refused to pay the contract price because they did not receive services. The present case arose when National City filed lawsuits against appellants seeking payments owed under the contracts which had been assigned to it.</p>\n<p id=\"b204-12\">{\u00b6 4} Claiming that the forum-selection clause contained in the contracts provided the Butler County Court of Common Pleas with jurisdiction, National City filed suit in that court. Appellants filed motions to dismiss, claiming that Ohio did not have personal jurisdiction over them. The trial court granted these motions to dismiss, and National City appealed. Appellants moved to dismiss the <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"83\">*83</page-number>appeal, arguing that the trial court\u2019s dismissal for lack of personal jurisdiction was not a final, appealable order. The court of appeals denied the motion to dismiss and determined that the trial court\u2019s dismissal was a final, appealable order. The court of appeals certified its decision as in conflict with <em>Preferred Capital, </em>161 Ohio App.3d 346, 2005-Ohio-2607, 830 N.E.2d 403.</p>\n<p id=\"b205-4\">{\u00b6 5} R.C. 2505.02 defines a final order for purposes of appeal. Under R.C. 2505.02(B)(1), \u201c[a]n order is a final order that may be reviewed, affirmed, modified, or reversed, with or without retrial, when it is * * * [a]n order that affects a substantial right in an action that in effect determines the action and prevents a judgment.\u201d</p>\n<p id=\"b205-5\">{\u00b6 6} A \u201csubstantial right\u201d is \u201ca right that the United States Constitution, the Ohio Constitution, a statute, the common law, or a rule of procedure entitles a person to enforce or protect.\u201d R.C. 2505.02(A)(1). For purposes of this case, we will assume that the trial court\u2019s dismissal for lack of personal jurisdiction deprived National City of a substantial right \u2014 the right to seek enforcement of its contract with appellants.</p>\n<p id=\"b205-6\">{\u00b6 7} To be final, however, \u201can order must also determine an action and prevent a judgment.\u201d <em>Chef Italiano Corp. v. Kent State Univ. </em>(1989), 44 Ohio St.3d 86, 88, 541 N.E.2d 64, citing <em>Gen. Elec. Supply Co. v. Warden Elec., Inc. </em>(1988), 38 Ohio St.3d 378, 528 N.E.2d 195, syllabus; R.C. 2505.02(B)(1). \u201cFor an order to determine the action and prevent a judgment for the party appealing, it must dispose of the whole merits of the cause or some separate and distinct branch thereof and leave nothing for the determination of the court.\u201d <em>Hamilton Cty. Bd. of Mental Retardation &amp; Developmental Disabilities v. Professionals Guild of Ohio </em>(1989), 46 Ohio St.3d 147, 153, 545 N.E.2d 1260. See <em>State ex rel. Downs v. Panioto, </em>107 Ohio St.3d 347, 2006-Ohio-8, 839 N.E.2d 911, \u00b620.</p>\n<p id=\"b205-7\">{\u00b6 8} The trial court ruled that \u201c[n]o evidence has been presented here from which the court may conclude that this defendant is subject to jurisdiction in the Ohio courts pursuant to R.C. 2307.382 and/or Civil Rule 4.3.\u201d By rule, a dismissal for lack of personal jurisdiction \u201coperate[s] as a failure otherwise than on the merits.\u201d Civ.R. 41(B)(4)(a). Ordinarily, a dismissal \u201cotherwise than on the merits\u201d does not prevent a party from refiling and, therefore, ordinarily, such a dismissal is not a final, appealable order. In this case, however, National City cannot refile. In essence, a final judgment has been rendered against National City because the cause has been disposed of and there is nothing left for the determination of the trial court. See <em>Hamilton Cty. Bd. of Mental Retardation, </em>46 Ohio St.3d at 153, 545 N.E.2d 1260.</p>\n<p id=\"b205-8\">{\u00b6 9} National City has a contract that it is seeking to enforce, but upon a determination that the trial court lacks personal jurisdiction over the defendant, National City is prevented from enforcing that right. If the trial court\u2019s decision <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"84\">*84</page-number>is not final and appealable, National City is prevented even from challenging the trial court\u2019s decision to dismiss its case. The injustice of this result is manifest and is proven by a simple example. Suppose a person who had never been in a state other than Ohio or a country other than the United States sued another person who had never been in a state other than Ohio or a country other than the United States, and suppose further that the trial judge dismissed the case for lack of personal jurisdiction. According to the rule of law proposed by the appellants, the losing party would have no right to appeal \u2014 not in Ohio, not in another state, not in another country. Such a rule of law cannot stand.</p>\n<p id=\"b206-5\">(\u00b6 10} Parties that believe an Ohio court has wrongly asserted jurisdiction over them have a right of appeal. <em>Goldstein v. Christiansen </em>(1994), 70 Ohio St.3d 232, 235, 638 N.E.2d 541, citing <em>State ex rel. Bradford v. Trumbull Cty. Court </em>(1992), 64 Ohio St.3d 502, 597 N.E.2d 116, and <em>State ex rel. Pearson v. Moore </em>(1990), 48 Ohio St.3d 37, 548 N.E.2d 945 (\u201cAbsent a patent and unambiguous lack of jurisdiction, a court having general jurisdiction of the subject matter of an action has authority to determine its own jurisdiction. A party challenging the court\u2019s jurisdiction has an adequate remedy at law via appeal from the court\u2019s holding that it has jurisdiction\u201d). See <em>State ex rel. Toma v. Corrigan </em>(2001), 92 Ohio St.3d 589, 594, 752 N.E.2d 281; <em>Clark v. Connor </em>(1998), 82 Ohio St.3d 309, 311-312, 695 N.E.2d 751. It is not logical to allow a party that believes a court wrongly asserted jurisdiction to appeal but to prevent a party that believes a court wrongly did not assert jurisdiction from appealing.</p>\n<p id=\"b206-6\">{\u00b6 11} Although it is not common for us to review cases that have been dismissed other than on the merits, we have done so when \u2014 as in this case\u2014 justice so requires. See <em>Svoboda v. Brunswick </em>(1983), 6 Ohio St.3d 348, 351, 6 OBR 403, 453 N.E.2d 648 (\u201cThe primary objective and function of our courts is to adjudicate cases on the merits * * *, not to adjudicates cases with finality upon a strained construction of procedural law yielding unjust results\u201d). In <em>Preferred Capital, Inc. v. Power Eng. Group, Inc., </em>112 Ohio St.3d 429, 2007-Ohio-257, 860 N.E.2d 741, \u00b6 5, we reviewed a case in which the trial court had sustained \u201cmotions to dismiss for lack of personal jurisdiction.\u201d In <em>Kennecorp Mtge. Brokers v. Country Club Convalescent Hosp., Inc. </em>(1993), 66 Ohio St.3d 173, 610 N.E.2d 987, we reviewed a dismissal based on a lack of personal jurisdiction. In <em>Chambers v. Merrell-Dow Pharmaceuticals, Inc. </em>(1988), 35 Ohio St.3d 123, 519 N.E.2d 370, we reviewed a dismissal based upon the doctrine of forum non conveniens.</p>\n<p id=\"b206-7\">{\u00b6 12} In <em>Lantsberry v. Tilley Lamp Co. </em>(1971), 27 Ohio St.2d 303, 56 O.O.2d 179, 272 N.E.2d 127, this court stated in paragraph one of the syllabus: \u201cA judgment of a trial court sustaining motions to quash service of summons and dismissing defendants as parties to the action is a final appealable order.\u201d We <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"85\">*85</page-number>concluded that even though the motion to quash service was not a decision on the merits, it nevertheless was determinative of the action because, in sustaining the motion to quash, the trial judge also dismissed the defendants and thereby \u201cdisposed of the cases.\u201d Id. at 306, 56 O.O.2d 179, 272 N.E.2d 127. Our conclusion was based on the rationale that a \u201ccourt making an order which is not final is thereby retaining jurisdiction for further proceedings.\u201d Id. The trial court in <em>Lantsberry </em>did not retain jurisdiction, and the dismissal otherwise than on the merits was considered a final, appealable order. In this case, we reach the same result. Even though the trial court\u2019s dismissal of the action against the appellants, for lack of personal jurisdiction, is otherwise than on the merits, the trial court did not retain jurisdiction, and the dismissal is a final, appealable order.</p>\n<p id=\"b207-5\">Judgment affirmed and cause remanded.</p>\n<judges id=\"b207-6\">Moyer, C.J., Calabrese, Lundberg Stratton, O\u2019Connor and Lanzinger, JJ., concur.</judges>\n<judges id=\"b207-7\">O\u2019Donnell, J., dissents.</judges>\n<judges id=\"b207-8\">Anthony 0.

I believe that the trial court order dismissing this action pursuant to Civ.R. 12(B)(2), without prejudice and not on the merits, is not a final, appealable order.</p>\n<p id=\"b207-12\">{\u00b6 14} The law with respect to final, appealable orders emanates from Section 3(B)(2), Article IV, Ohio Constitution, which states that \u201c[c]ourts of appeals shall have such jurisdiction as may be provided by law to review and affirm, modify, or reverse <em>judgments or final orders </em>of the courts of record inferior to the court of appeals within the district.\u201d (Emphasis added.) The legislature, in turn, enacted R.C. 2505.02(B)(1), which provides that an order is final and appealable when it \u201caffects a substantial right in an action that in effect <em>determines the action and prevents a judgment.\u201d </em>(Emphasis added.) Moreover, as this court explained in <em>Hamilton Cty. Bd. of Mental Retardation &amp; Dev. Disabilities v. Professionals Guild of Ohio </em>(1989), 46 Ohio St.3d 147, 153, 545 N.E.2d 1260, \u201c[flor an order to determine the action and prevent a judgment for the party appealing, it must <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"86\">*86</page-number>dispose of <em>the whole merits of the cause </em>or some separate and distinct branch thereof and leave nothing for the determination of the court\u201d (Emphasis added.)</p>\n<p id=\"b208-4\">{\u00b6 15} In the matter before us, the trial court, pursuant to Civ.R. 12(B)(2), dismissed the breach-of-contract actions that National City Commercial Capital Corporation filed against 129 businesses located outside the state of Ohio, stating that it lacked personal jurisdiction over those parties. Consistent with Civ.R. 41(B)(4)(a), which provides that a dismissal for lack of personal jurisdiction \u201coperate[s] as a failure otherwise than on the merits,\u201d it is my view that the trial court never reached the merits of National City\u2019s breach-of-contract claims against those entities.</p>\n<p id=\"b208-5\">{\u00b6 16} Contrary to the holding of the majority, the trial court order does not prevent National City from obtaining a judgment on its causes of action for breach of contract against those business entities because it is not prevented from refiling the same claims against the same defendants in a court of competent jurisdiction, in Ohio or elsewhere.</p>\n<p id=\"b208-6\">{\u00b6 17} As a result of the dismissals for lack of personal jurisdiction, the court has neither disposed of the whole merits of these actions nor determined the action or prevented a judgment. See, e.g., <em>Preferred Capital, Inc. v. Strellec, </em>161 Ohio App.3d 346, 2005-Ohio-2607, 830 N.E.2d 403, \u00b6 19, wherein the appellate court stated that \u201cthe determination that the order \u2018prevents a judgment\u2019 simply because it may prevent a judgment on the merits in <em>Ohio </em>reflects an undeserved lack of confidence in our sister courts in other states and reaches beyond the terms of R.C. 2505.02. If the legislature had meant to say \u2018prevents a judgment <em>in Ohio,\u2019 </em>it certainly could have done so.\u201d (Emphasis sic.) See, also, <em>Smart Pages v. Ohio Mtge., </em>Cuyahoga App. No. 83004, 2003-Ohio-7074, 2003 WL 23010083. Moreover, the order does not bar National City from refiling on its causes of action in an Ohio court, as long as it can demonstrate an appropriate basis for the exercise of personal jurisdiction over the entities it intends to pursue.</p>\n<p id=\"b208-7\">{\u00b6 18} I do not agree with the majority\u2019s conclusion that the consequence of authorizing a party to seek appellate review from a trial court order exercising personal jurisdiction but not from a trial court order declining personal jurisdiction is unjust and illogical. Such a result is neither unjust nor illogical because, as in this case, the order does not prevent the claimant from refiling its action in a court that has personal jurisdiction over a defendant and that has the ability to reach the merits of the claims presented.</p>\n<p id=\"b208-8\">{\u00b6 19} Because the order dismissing these actions for lack of personal jurisdiction and without prejudice is a failure other than on the merits, it did not determine the action and prevent a judgment on the causes of action against the <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"87\">*87</page-number>business entities. See R.C. 2505.02(B)(1). Accordingly, the order is not final and appealable, and I would reverse the judgment of the court of appeals.</p>\n<attorneys id=\"AZS\">Coley <em>&amp; </em>Associates Co., L.P.A., William P.
