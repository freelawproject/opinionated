After Lomax waived his right to a jury trial, the court proceeded with a bench trial, during which the following evidence was presented. On May 24, 2003, Lomax attended a family birthday party with his girlfriend, Brandy Tooson. Robert Christian was also present. At some time during the evening, Christian and Tooson got into a physical argument over a chair, resulting in Tooson\u2019s ending up on the floor. Accounts of how this happened vary; it is unclear whether Christian shoved Tooson or pulled the chair out from under her. Tooson\u2019s cousin, who saw the incident, got involved by punching Christian in the face. The other partygoers separated the two and encouraged Christian to leave the party. At that point, Lomax, who had been outside, learned of the altercation and confronted Christian, asking, \u201cDid you disrespect my woman?\u201d After a brief argument, the men separated.</p>\n<p id=\"b473-14\">{\u00b6 3} Lomax went outside to his truck and then approached Christian and the crowd of people that had gathered around him. Several witnesses testified that Lomax swung at Christian several times and walked away. Christian then exclaimed that he had been stabbed. Christian died later that night. Lomax <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"352\">*352</page-number>admitted stabbing Christian but claimed it was in self-defense. Both he and Tooson testified that Christian had him in a chokehold, although no other witness mentioned a chokehold. The court found Lomax guilty and sentenced him to 15 years to life in prison.</p>\n<p id=\"b474-4\">{\u00b6 4} On appeal, Lomax argued that his jury waiver was not properly executed and that the trial court lacked jurisdiction to conduct a bench trial because the waiver was not \u201cmade in open court.\u201d Although he had signed a written waiver, Lomax argued that the trial court did not question him and merely noted that there would be a waiver of jury trial. The court of appeals agreed with Lomax and reversed the trial court\u2019s judgment, holding that the \u201cmere mention in passing on the record that there was a jury waiver was not sufficient to comply with the \u2018open court\u2019 requirement of R.C. 2945.05.\u201d 166 Ohio App.3d 555, 2006-Ohio-1373, 852 N.E.2d 205, \u00b6 36.</p>\n<p id=\"b474-5\">{\u00b6 5} We accepted the state\u2019s discretionary appeal. In its proposition of law, the state seeks a ruling that the Constitution does not require a colloquy in open court in order for a jury waiver to be valid. Lomax responds that Crim.R. 23(A), R.C. 2945.05, and governing case law demand that for a proper waiver of the right to trial by jury, a defendant must sign a written statement, and the court must reaffirm the waiver in open court. We are asked, therefore, to determine what effect a written waiver of the right to trial by jury has upon the requirement in R.C. 2945.05 that the waiver must be made in \u201copen court.\u201d</p>\n<p id=\"b474-6\">Law and Analysis</p>\n<p id=\"b474-7\">{\u00b6 6} The Sixth Amendment to the United States Constitution, made applicable to the states through the Fourteenth Amendment, guarantees an accused the right to trial by jury. <em>Duncan v. Louisiana </em>(1968), 391 U.S. 145, 88 S.Ct. 1444, 20 L.Ed.2d 491. Likewise, Section 5, Article I of the Ohio Constitution states that the \u201cright of trial by jury shall be inviolate.\u201d However, Crim.R. 23(A)<footnotemark>1</footnotemark> allows a defendant to waive his right to a trial by jury in serious offense cases provided that the waiver is made knowingly, intelligently, and voluntarily, and in writing. The General Assembly has set forth the manner in which a defendant may waive this right. R.C. 2945.05 states:</p>\n<p id=\"b475-5\"><page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"353\">*353</page-number>{\u00b6 7} \u201cIn all criminal cases pending in courts of record in this state, the defendant may waive a trial by jury and be tried by the court without a jury. Such waiver by a defendant, <em>shall be in writing, signed by the defendant, and filed in said cause and made a part of the record thereof. </em>It shall be entitled in the court and cause, and in substance as follows: T_, defendant in the above cause, hereby voluntarily waive and relinquish my right to a trial by jury, and elect to be tried by a Judge of the Court in which the said cause may be pending. I fully understand that under the laws of this state, I have a constitutional right to a trial by jury.\u2019</p>\n<p id=\"b475-8\">{\u00b6 8} <em>\u201cSuch waiver of trial by jury must be made in open court after the defendant has </em>been arraigned and has had opportunity to consult with counsel. Such waiver may be withdrawn by the defendant at any time before the commencement of the trial.\u201d (Emphasis added.)</p>\n<p id=\"b475-9\">{\u00b6 9} Therefore, to be valid, a waiver must meet five conditions. It must be (1) in writing, (2) signed by the defendant, (3) filed, (4) made part of the record, and (5) made in open court.</p>\n<p id=\"b475-10\">{\u00b6 10} Four of these five points are not in issue. Lomax signed a written waiver, which was filed on June 28, 2004, the first day of trial, and which was made a part of the record.<footnotemark>2</footnotemark> A written waiver is presumptively voluntary, knowing, and intelligent. <em>State v. Bays </em>(1999), 87 Ohio St.3d 15, 19, 716 N.E.2d 1126, citing <em>United States v. Sammons </em>(C.A.6, 1990), 918 F.2d 592, 597. Lomax contends that his jury waiver did not satisfy the open-court requirement of R.C. 2945.05. Although he acknowledges that a trial court is not required to inform a defendant of all possible implications of waiver, <em>State v. Green </em>(2000), 90 Ohio St.3d 352, 367, 738 N.E.2d 1208, Lomax argues that the trial court did not inform him of anything. The question, then, is whether this waiver was made in open court.</p>\n<p id=\"b475-11\">{\u00b6 11} In <em>State v. Jells </em>(1990), 53 Ohio St.3d 22, 559 N.E.2d 464, we considered the type of colloquy required for a valid waiver of jury trial. <em>Jells </em>involved a defendant in a death-penalty prosecution who had signed a written waiver that conformed to the requirements of R.C. 2945.05. The defendant argued that the following three-question inquiry conducted by the court was inadequate to determine the validity of the waiver:</p>\n<p id=\"b475-12\">{\u00b6 12} \u201c \u2018THE COURT: Reginald, is that your signature?</p>\n<p id=\"b475-13\">{\u00b6 13} \u201c \u2018THE DEFENDANT: Yes, it is, sir.</p>\n<p id=\"b476-4\"><page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"354\">*354</page-number>{\u00b6 14} \u201c \u2018THE COURT: You did this of your own free will?</p>\n<p id=\"b476-5\">{\u00b6 15} \u201c \u2018THE DEFENDANT: Yes, I did.</p>\n<p id=\"b476-6\">{\u00b6 16} \u201c \u2018THE COURT: Nobody forced you to do this?</p>\n<p id=\"b476-7\">{\u00b6 17} \u201c \u2018THE DEFENDANT: No, sir.</p>\n<p id=\"b476-8\">{\u00b6 18} \u201c \u2018THE COURT: All right.</p>\n<p id=\"b476-9\">{\u00b6 19} \u201c \u2018MR. HUBBARD [defense counsel]: I have witnessed his signature, your Honor.</p>\n<p id=\"b476-10\">{\u00b6 20} \u201c \u2018THE COURT: This will be made part of the record.\u2019 \u201d Id. at 25, 559 N.E.2d 464.</p>\n<p id=\"b476-11\">{\u00b6 21} In upholding the defendant\u2019s waiver, we held: \u201cThere is no requirement in Ohio for the trial court to interrogate a defendant in order to determine whether he or she is fully apprised of the right to a jury trial. The Criminal Rules and the Revised Code are satisfied by a written waiver, signed by the defendant, filed with the court, and made in open court, after arraignment and opportunity to consult with counsel. See <em>State v. Morris </em>(1982), 8 Ohio App.3d 12, 14, 8 OBR 13, 15-16, 455 N.E.2d 1352, 1355. While it may be better practice for the trial judge to enumerate all the possible implications of a waiver of a jury, there is no error in failing to do so.\u201d Id. at 25-26, 8 OBR 13, 559 N.E.2d 464. Therefore, the judge in <em>Jells </em>satisfied the \u201copen court\u201d requirement by asking the defendant several questions on the record.</p>\n<p id=\"b476-12\">{\u00b6 22} We considered a similar question in <em>Bays, </em>87 Ohio St.3d 15, 716 N.E.2d 1126. The defendant in <em>Bays </em>had also signed a written waiver pursuant to R.C. 2945.05. After the defendant\u2019s counsel submitted the waiver, the trial judge engaged in the following exchange with the defendant:</p>\n<p id=\"b476-13\">{\u00b6 23} \u201c \u2018JUDGE GRIGSBY: Now, Mr. Bays, I want to explain to you, you have a right to a Jury Trial of 12 people. That is your Constitutional right. If you sign this waiver of Jury Trial and begin the trial, there is no changing. You understand after a trial is begun, then you cannot go back and ask for a Jury?</p>\n<p id=\"b476-14\">{\u00b624} \u201c\u2018THE DEFENDANT: Yes.</p>\n<p id=\"b476-15\">{\u00b6 25} \u201c \u2018JUDGE GRIGSBY: Do you understand that?</p>\n<p id=\"b476-16\">{\u00b6 26} \u201c \u2018THE DEFENDANT: Yes.</p>\n<p id=\"b476-17\">{\u00b6 27} \u201c \u2018JUDGE GRIGSBY: Now, I want to ask you, you are not under any drugs or alcohol or anything like that this morning, are you?</p>\n<p id=\"b476-18\">{\u00b6 28} \u201c \u2018THE DEFENDANT: No.</p>\n<p id=\"b476-19\">{\u00b6 29} \u201c \u2018JUDGE GRIGSBY: This waiver must be made knowingly, and by that, I mean, you understand what you are doing. You are giving up your right to a Jury, and in a case like this, a Jury\u2019s verdict must be unanimous. In other <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"355\">*355</page-number>words, if you convince, or your Counsel convinces one Juror not to convict you, there will at least be a mistrial and retrial.</p>\n<p id=\"b477-5\">{\u00b6 30} \u201c \u2018Do you understand you are giving up that right of the Jury?</p>\n<p id=\"b477-6\">{\u00b6 31} \u201c \u2018THE DEFENDANT: Yes, I understand that.</p>\n<p id=\"b477-7\">{\u00b6 32} \u201c \u2018JUDGE GRIGSBY: And is there any \u2014 well, just tell me why you want to give up the Jury.</p>\n<p id=\"b477-8\">{\u00b6 33} \u201c \u2018THE DEFENDANT: My Counsel feels it\u2019s best.</p>\n<p id=\"b477-9\">{\u00b6 34} \u201c \u2018JUDGE GRIGSBY: Now, are you doing this voluntarily, of your own free will?</p>\n<p id=\"b477-10\">{\u00b6 35} \u201c \u2018THE DEFENDANT: I don\u2019t know which way I want to go really. With the Jury, I don\u2019t figure it was a fair pick.</p>\n<p id=\"b477-11\">{\u00b6 36} \u201c \u2018JUDGE GRIGSBY: Well, regardless of whether you waive a Jury, whether it\u2019s this panel or another panel, are you giving up that right to a Jury Trial by your own volition?</p>\n<p id=\"b477-12\">{\u00b6 37} \u201c \u2018THE DEFENDANT: Yes.</p>\n<p id=\"b477-13\">{\u00b6 38} \u201c \u2018JUDGE GRIGSBY: Then the rule says you must sign that in open Court. I\u2019m going to give you an unsigned copy and I want you to read it. If you have any questions, now is the time to ask them.\u2019 \u201d 87 Ohio St.3d at 18, 716 N.E.2d 1126.</p>\n<p id=\"b477-14\">{\u00b6 39} The defendant then signed another waiver, which the judge accepted.</p>\n<p id=\"b477-15\">{\u00b6 40} When Bays challenged the validity of his jury waiver, we stated: \u201c[A] defendant need not have a complete or technical understanding of the jury trial right in order to knowingly and intelligently waive it.\u201d 87 Ohio St.3d at 20, 716 N.E.2d 1126. \u201c[I]f the record shows a jury waiver, the verdict will not be set aside except on a plain showing that the waiver was not freely and intelligently made.\u201d Id. at 19, 716 N.E.2d 1126.</p>\n<p id=\"b477-16\">{\u00b6 41} The state points to <em>State v. Pless </em>(1996), 74 Ohio St.3d 333, 658 N.E.2d 766, as support for the argument that a colloquy is not required and that all that is required is a written waiver. However, in <em>Pless, </em>we found the jury waiver invalid because although written, the waiver was never filed or made part of the record. While there was evidence that the defendant signed a written jury waiver form in open court, in the presence of his attorneys, after engaging in a lengthy discussion with the trial judge, we held that strict compliance with the requirements of R.C. 2945.05 is necessary. Contrary to the state\u2019s argument, although we held that a written jury waiver as required by R.C. 2945.05 is necessary for a valid waiver, we did not hold that it is sufficient.</p>\n<p id=\"b477-17\">{\u00b642} Considering the aforementioned cases, we conclude that a trial court does not need to engage in an extended colloquy with the defendant in order to <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"356\">*356</page-number>comply with the statutory requirement that a jury waiver be made in open court. There must be, however, some evidence in the record of the proceedings that the defendant acknowledged the waiver to the trial court while in the presence of counsel, if any. Absent such evidence, the waiver does not comply with the requirements of R.C. 2945.05 and is therefore invalid. In both <em>Jells </em>and <em>Bays, </em>the \u201cin open court\u201d requirement was satisfied when the trial court inquired whether the defendant had voluntarily signed a jury trial waiver.</p>\n<p id=\"b478-4\">{\u00b6 43} Applying this principle to the case at bar, we conclude that the judgment of the court of appeals must be affirmed. Here, the trial transcript contains only one reference to the jury waiver:</p>\n<p id=\"b478-5\">{\u00b6 44} \u201cThe court: Okay. I understand we are finally ready on the Lomax case.</p>\n<p id=\"b478-6\">{\u00b6 45} \u201cSince there\u2019s going to be a jury waiver, does the State care to make an opening statement at this time?</p>\n<p id=\"b478-7\">{\u00b6 46} \u201cMs. Burroughs: Briefly.\u201d</p>\n<p id=\"b478-8\">{\u00b6 47} Aside from this passing reference to a jury waiver, the trial court did not address Lomax and have him acknowledge in the courtroom and in the presence of counsel that he was waiving his right to a jury trial. In fact, the trial court\u2019s comment indicating that there was \u201cgoing to be a waiver\u201d implies that the waiver had not yet occurred at the commencement of the trial. Because there is no indication from the transcript, nor any other evidence in the record, that Lomax waived his right to a jury trial in open court, the requirements of R.C. 2945.05 were not met in this case and the waiver must be deemed invalid.</p>\n<p id=\"b478-9\">{\u00b6 48} We do not mandate magic words, or a prolonged colloquy, but simply what Ohio law intends \u2014 that a defendant while in the courtroom and in the presence of counsel, if any, acknowledge to the trial court that the defendant wishes to waive the right to a jury trial.</p>\n<p id=\"b478-10\">Conclusion</p>\n<p id=\"b478-11\">{\u00b6 49} We therefore hold that a waiver of the right to a trial by jury must not only be made in writing, signed by the defendant, and filed as a part of the record, but must also be made in open court. To satisfy the \u201cin open court\u201d requirement in R.C. 2945.05, there must be some evidence in the record that the defendant while in the courtroom and in the presence of counsel, if any, acknowledged the jury waiver to the trial court. We therefore affirm the judgment of the Court of Appeals for Hamilton County.</p>\n<p id=\"b478-12\">Judgment affirmed.</p>\n<judges id=\"b478-13\">Moyer, C.J., Pfeifer, Lundberg Stratton, O\u2019Connor, O\u2019Donnell and Cupp, JJ., concur.</judges>\n<attorneys id=\"AIH\"><page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"357\">*357</page-number>Joseph T.
