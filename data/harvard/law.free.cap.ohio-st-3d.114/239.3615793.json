The first issue is whether the 2001 amendment to Ohio\u2019s uninsured- and underinsured-motorist coverage law, R.C. 3937.18, contained in Am.Sub.S.B. No. 97, 149 Ohio Laws, Part I, 779, 779-786, effective Oct. 31, 2001 (\u201cS.B. 97\u201d), permits a motor vehicle insurance policy to exclude claims for uninsured-motorists benefits when the tortfeasor is statutorily immune from liability. If the answer to this first question is \u201cyes,\u201d then the second issue we must address is whether an insurance policy that restricts coverage to amounts that the insured is \u201clegally entitled to recover\u201d from the uninsured motorist unambiguously provides that coverage will be denied when the uninsured tortfeasor is protected by a statutory immunity.</p>\n<p id=\"b362-8\">{\u00b62} For the reasons that follow, we conclude that R.C. 3937.18 does not prohibit enforcement of a policy that excludes claims for uninsured-motorist benefits when the tortfeasor is statutorily immune from liability. We also conclude that policy language restricting uninsured-motorist coverage to those amounts the insured is \u201clegally entitled to recover\u201d from the tortfeasor owner or operator of an uninsured motor vehicle unambiguously denies coverage for injuries caused by uninsured motorists who are immune from liability under R.C. Chapter 2744 or R.C. 4123.741. Accordingly, we affirm the judgment of the court of appeals.</p>\n<p id=\"b362-9\">I</p>\n<p id=\"b362-10\">A</p>\n<p id=\"b362-11\">{\u00b6 3} On November 2, 2002, appellant, Jennifer Snyder, a Columbus police officer, along with several other Columbus police officers, pursued a fleeing suspect during an emergency call. Snyder was on foot. A police cruiser driven by Officer Castro hit Snyder. The impact threw Snyder onto the hood of the cruiser and into the windshield. The parties do not dispute that Castro was negligent and that Snyder sustained injuries as a result of that negligence.<footnotemark>1</footnotemark></p>\n<p id=\"b362-12\">{\u00b6 4} After her injury, Snyder submitted to appellee, American Family Insurance Company, a claim for uninsured-motorist benefits pursuant to her personal motor vehicle liability insurance policy. Snyder\u2019s policy with American Family <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"241\">*241</page-number>provided uninsured-motorist coverage of $100,000 per person and $300,000 per occurrence. That policy had first become effective on October 19, 2001. A renewal of the policy, dated October 19, 2002, was in force on the date of Snyder\u2019s injury.</p>\n<p id=\"b363-5\">{\u00b6 5} The pertinent language of the American Family policy provided: \u201c[American Family] will pay compensatory damages for bodily injury which an insured person is legally entitled to recover from the owner or operator of an uninsured motor vehicle.\u201d (Boldface sic.) American Family denied coverage.</p>\n<p id=\"b363-6\">B</p>\n<p id=\"b363-7\">{\u00b6 6} Snyder sued American Family to recover uninsured-motorist benefits under the policy. Snyder argued that she was entitled to coverage because R.C. 3937.18 includes persons who have \u201cimmunity under Chapter 2744. of the Revised Code\u201d within its definition of \u201cuninsured motorists.\u201d See R.C. 3937.18(B)(5). Additionally, the statute, as amended in 2001, no longer requires the insured to be \u201clegally entitled to recover\u201d from the tortfeasor. American Family argued in the courts below that Snyder was not \u201clegally entitled to recover\u201d from either Officer Castro or the city of Columbus, as required by the policy, because of the tortfeasors\u2019 statutory immunity.</p>\n<p id=\"b363-8\">{\u00b6 7} It is not disputed that the city and Officer Castro are immune from liability under R.C. Chapter 2744, Ohio\u2019s Political Subdivision Tort Immunity Act. Specifically, the parties do not dispute that the city is immune under R.C. 2744.02(B)(1)(a),<footnotemark>2</footnotemark> which provides a defense to liability if the claimant\u2019s injury occurred as a result of a police officer responding to an emergency call. Nor is it disputed that Officer Castro is immune from liability under R.C. 2744.03(A)(6),<footnotemark>3</footnotemark> <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"242\">*242</page-number>because Castro was within the scope of her employment when the injury occurred. There is also no dispute that Officer Castro is immune from liability under R.C. 4123.741, the fellow-servant immunity statute. The fellow-servant immunity statute precludes an employee from bringing suit against a fellow employee for injury incurred in the course and scope of the injured employee\u2019s employment when the injury is compensable under the workers\u2019 compensation statutes. See R.C. 4123.741.<footnotemark>4</footnotemark></p>\n<p id=\"b364-5\">{\u00b6 8} The trial court granted Snyder\u2019s motion for partial summary judgment and denied American Family\u2019s motion for summary judgment. Rejecting American Family\u2019s argument that an earlier version of R.C. 3937.18 applied, the trial court applied the 2001 version of the statute.<footnotemark>5</footnotemark> The trial court then held that the city of Columbus and Officer Castro were \u201cuninsured motorists\u201d as defined in R.C. 3937.18(B)(5), because they had immunity under R.C. Chapter 2744. The trial court further ruled that R.C. 3937.18 protected Snyder from being denied uninsured-motorist benefits on the basis that she was not \u201clegally entitled to recover\u201d from the city and Officer Castro. The trial court opined that it would be illogical for an uninsured-motorist policy to preclude recovery based on an immunity defense, because the 2001 statute specifically includes tortfeasors \u201cimmune under R.C. Chapter 2744\u201d within the definition of \u201cuninsured motorist.\u201d See R.C. 3937.18(B)(5).<footnotemark>6</footnotemark> The parties stipulated to the amount of Snyder\u2019s damages, and the trial court entered final judgment for Snyder.</p>\n<p id=\"b365-4\"><page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"243\">*243</page-number>{\u00b6 9} On appeal, the Franklin County Court of Appeals reversed. It ruled that R. C. 3937.18 as amended in 2001 did not preclude insurers from limiting uninsured-motorist coverage to amounts that the insured was legally entitled to recover from the tortfeasor. <em>Snyder v. Am. Family Ins. Co., </em>10th Dist. No. 05AP-116, 2005-Ohio-6751, 2005 WL 3484221, \u00b6 21-25. The court of appeals reasoned that \u201c[t]he fact that the legislature removed its own \u2018terms and conditions that preclude coverage\u2019 from the statute does not mean that no such terms and conditions are permitted to be placed in policies with UM coverage.\u201d Id. at \u00b6 22.</p>\n<p id=\"b365-6\">{\u00b6 10} The appeals court concluded that R.C. 3937.18(1), which permits policies to exclude claims for uninsured-motorist coverage under specified circumstances, \u201c[left] to the parties whether any preconditions or exclusions to coverage will govern their relationship.\u201d Id. As applied to the present case, the appellate court ruled that the policy\u2019s \u201clegally entitled to recover\u201d provision required that the insured must be able to obtain a judgment against the tortfeasor. Id. at \u00b6 23. Because Snyder could not recover against Columbus or Officer Castro due to their immunity under R.C. Chapter 2744 (as to both tortfeasors) and R.C. 4123.741 (as to Officer Castro), Snyder failed to meet the policy\u2019s \u201clegally entitled to recover\u201d precondition to coverage. Id. at \u00b6 18, 23, and 25.</p>\n<p id=\"b365-7\">{\u00b6 11} Snyder appealed the court of appeals\u2019 judgment to this court, and we granted review.</p>\n<p id=\"b365-8\">{\u00b6 12} In this court, Snyder asserts that the term \u201clegally entitled to recover\u201d as used in American Family\u2019s policy is void because it contradicts the terms of the statute, the 2001 version of R.C. 3937.18. Snyder\u2019s second contention is that the phrase \u201clegally entitled to recover,\u201d which is undefined in the policy, is ambiguous and must therefore be construed narrowly and in favor of the insured. Snyder\u2019s third proposition is that because the tortfeasors herein qualify as \u201cuninsured motorists\u201d under the statutory definition of R.C. 3937.18(B)(5), Snyder is entitled to recover uninsured-motorist benefits under the policy. For clarity of analysis, we address Snyder\u2019s first and third propositions together.</p>\n<p id=\"b365-9\">II</p>\n<p id=\"b365-10\">A</p>\n<p id=\"b365-11\">{\u00b6 13} The General Assembly extensively amended R.C. 3937.18 in 2001, in S. B. 97.<footnotemark>7</footnotemark> For example, before S.B. 97, the statute required insurers to offer <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"244\">*244</page-number>uninsured- and underinsured-motorist coverage to all persons who obtained motor vehicle liability insurance policies in Ohio. See, e.g., former R.C. 3937.18, 148 Ohio Laws, Part V, 11380.</p>\n<p id=\"b366-5\">1</p>\n<p id=\"b366-6\">{\u00b6 14} Among the significant changes in the 2001 amendment was the removal of the requirement that insurers must offer uninsured- or underinsured-motorist coverage to persons purchasing motor vehicle liability insurance. Instead, the law now provides that an insurer \u201cmay, but is not required to,\u201d include uninsured-motorist coverage or underinsured-motorist coverage, or both, in a motor vehicle policy. See R.C. 3937.18(A). The General Assembly expressly stated that its intention was to eliminate the mandatory offering of uninsured- and underinsured-motorist coverage and the imposition of any such coverage implied as a matter of law. See S.B. 97, Sections 3(B)(1), (2), and (4), 149 Ohio Laws, Part I, 779, 788-789.</p>\n<p id=\"b366-7\">{\u00b6 15} Additionally, the 2001 statute for the first time permits policies with uninsured-motorist coverage to limit or exclude coverage under circumstances that are specified in the policy even if those circumstances are not also specified in the statute. See R.C. 3937.18(1). Division (I) of the statute provides: \u201cAny <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"245\">*245</page-number>policy of insurance that includes uninsured motorist coverage, underinsured motorist coverage, or both uninsured and underinsured motorist coverages may include terms and conditions that preclude coverage for bodily injury or death suffered by an insured under specified circumstances, <em>including but not limited to </em>any of the following circumstances: * * (Emphasis added.) R.C. 3937.18(1). Eliminating the mandatory coverage offering and simultaneously permitting the parties to agree to coverage exclusions not listed in the statute provide insurers considerable flexibility in devising specific restrictions on any offered uninsured- or underinsured-motorist coverage. See also S.B. 97, Section 3(B)(3), 149 Ohio Laws, Part I, 788-789 (General Assembly expressed its intention to \u201c[p]rovide statutory authority for the inclusion of exclusionary or limiting provisions in uninsured motorist coverage, underinsured motorist coverage, or both uninsured and underinsured motorist coverages\u201d).</p>\n<p id=\"b367-5\">{\u00b6 16} The 2001 act also lists several conditions in which an owner or operator of a motor vehicle is considered an \u201cuninsured motorist.\u201d See R.C. 3937.18(B). One of those conditions is that an owner or operator (tortfeasor) is considered uninsured if he is immune from liability under the Political Subdivision Tort Liability Act. See R.C. 3937.18(B)(5). Moreover, an insured is required under the statute \u201cto prove all elements of the insured\u2019s claim that are necessary to recover from the owner or operator of the uninsured or underinsured motor vehicle.\u201d R.C. 3937.18(D). Finally, the 2001 statute eliminated the requirement in former R.C. 3937.18(A) that insureds must be \u201clegally entitled to recover\u201d from their tortfeasors and the provision that coverage is not precluded when the tortfeasor is statutorily immune from liability under R.C. Chapter 2744. Compare R.C. 3937.18 with former R.C. 3937.18(A)(1), 148 Ohio Laws, Part V, 11380, 11380-11381.</p>\n<p id=\"b367-7\">2</p>\n<p id=\"b367-8\">{\u00b6 17} Until 1994, the uninsured-motorist statute included, but did not define or otherwise qualify, the phrase \u201clegally entitled to recover.\u201d<footnotemark>8</footnotemark> In 1990, this court in <em>State Farm Mut. Auto. Ins. Co. v. Webb </em>(1990), 54 Ohio St.3d 61, 562 N.E.2d 132, construed the phrase \u201clegally entitled to recover\u201d under the version of R.C. 3937.18 then in effect, together with similar language in an insurance contract. The version of R.C. 3937.18(A)(1) then effective required uninsured-motorist coverage \u201cfor the protection of persons insured thereunder who are legally entitled to recover damages from owners or operators of uninsured motor <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"246\">*246</page-number>vehicles because of bodily injury.\u201d The phrase \u201clegally entitled to recover\u201d was not statutorily defined. See 1987 Am.Sub.ELB. No. 1, 142 Ohio Laws, Part I, 1661, 1739-1741. The court in <em>Webb </em>held that an insurer is not liable to its insured on an uninsured-motorist claim when the tortfeasor-motorist who caused the insured\u2019s injuries has liability insurance but is immune from liability under the fellow-servant immunity statute, R.C. 4123.741. 54 Ohio St.3d 61, 562 N.E.2d 132, syllabus. In such a case, the court reasoned, the insured is not \u201clegally entitled to recover\u201d from the tortfeasor. Id.</p>\n<p id=\"b368-5\">{\u00b6 18} The court in <em>Webb </em>cited with approval the decision in <em>York v. State Farm Fire &amp; Cas. Co. </em>(1980), 64 Ohio St.2d 199, 201-202, 18 O.O.3d 412, 414 N. E.2d 423, which held that the city\u2019s statutory immunity from liability for a collision that occurred while a fire truck responded to an emergency call precluded recovery for the uninsured-motorist claim. See <em>Webb, </em>54 Ohio St.3d at 62, 562 N.E.2d 132. The <em>York </em>court reasoned that the legislative intent behind then R.C. 3937.18 did not encompass situations in which the tortfeasor was \u201cnever legally liable\u201d because of its statutory immunity. <em>York, </em>64 Ohio St.2d at 201, 18 O.O.3d 412, 414 N.E.2d 423.</p>\n<p id=\"b368-8\">{\u00b6 19} In a 1994 amendment to R.C. 3937.18, the General Assembly qualified the \u201clegally entitled to recover\u201d provision by specifying that, for the purpose of the statute, an uninsured motorist\u2019s statutory or common-law immunity from liability would not defeat recovery. The 1994 amendment to R.C. 3937.18(A) provided:</p>\n<p id=\"b368-9\">{\u00b6 20} \u201cFor purposes of division (A)(1) of this section, a person is legally entitled to recover damages if he is able to prove the elements of his claim that are necessary to recover damages from the owner or operator of the uninsured motor vehicle. The fact that the owner or operator of the uninsured motor vehicle has an immunity, whether based upon a statute or the common law, that could be raised as a defense in an action brought against him by the person insured under uninsured motorist coverage does not affect the insured person\u2019s right to recover under his uninsured motorist coverage.\u201d 1994 Am. Sub.S.B. No. 20,145 Ohio Laws, Part I, 204, 210-212.</p>\n<p id=\"b368-10\">{\u00b6 21} The 1997 amendment to R.C. 3937.18(A) narrowed the field of statutory and common-law immunities that could defeat an insured\u2019s entitlement to uninsured-motorist benefits. Under the 1997 law, only diplomatic immunity or governmental immunity under R.C. Chapter 2744 did not affect the insured\u2019s right to recover on an uninsured-motorist claim. The 1997 amendment provided:</p>\n<p id=\"b368-11\">{\u00b622} \u201cFor purposes of division (A)(1) of this section, an insured is legally entitled to recover damages if the insured is able to prove the elements of the insured\u2019s claim that are necessary to recover damages from the owner or operator of the uninsured motor vehicle. The fact that the owner or operator of <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"247\">*247</page-number>the uninsured motor vehicle has an immunity <em>under Chapter 2744- of the Revised Code or a diplomatic immunity </em>that could be raised as a defense in an action brought against the owner or operator by the insured does not affect the insured\u2019s right to recover under uninsured motorist coverage. <em>However, any other type of statutory or common law immunity that may be a defense for the oumer or operator of an uninsured motor vehicle shall also be a defense to an action brought by the insured to recover under uninsured motorist </em>coverage.\u201d (Emphasis added.) 1997 Am.Sub.H.B. No. 261, 147 Ohio Laws, Part II, 2372, 2372-2377.</p>\n<p id=\"b369-5\">{\u00b6 23} This provision continued in the law until the 2001 amendment entirely deleted the \u201clegally entitled to recover\u201d language and its limitations.</p>\n<p id=\"b369-6\">B</p>\n<p id=\"b369-7\">{\u00b6 24} Removal of the \u201clegally entitled to recover\u201d language from the statute does not mean that insurance contracts may not require proof that the insured is legally entitled to recover from the uninsured motorist. Absent a specific statutory or common-law prohibition, parties are free to agree to the contract\u2019s terms. <em>Martin v. Midwestern Group Ins. Co. </em>(1994), 70 Ohio St.3d 478, 480, 639 N.E.2d 438 (noting that R.C. 3937.18 does not displace principles of contract law), superseded by statute on other grounds, as noted in <em>Baughman v. State Farm Mut. Auto. Ins. Co. </em>(2000), 88 Ohio St.3d 480, 484, 727 N.E.2d 1265. The current wording of R.C. 3937.18 neither requires nor prohibits inclusion of the \u201clegally entitled to recover\u201d provision at issue here. Indeed, R.C. 3937.18(1) confirms that the parties may include terms that exclude recovery of uninsured-motorist benefits under specified circumstances. We conclude that the \u201clegally entitled to recover\u201d provision in the policy at issue is such a term.</p>\n<p id=\"b369-8\">{\u00b6 25} Nor is Snyder correct in asserting that R.C. 3937.18(D)\u2019s requirement that an insured must prove \u201call elements of the insured\u2019s claim\u201d means that the insured never has to prove anything else to recover uninsured-motorist benefits. Absent a relevant restriction, \u201c[t]here is no reason why carriers should be refused the right to assert the very same rights and defenses available to the person whose alleged negligence they are required to indemnify.\u201d <em>State Farm Mut. Auto. Ins. Co. v. Webb, </em>54 Ohio St.3d at 64, 562 N.E.2d 132.</p>\n<p id=\"b369-9\">{\u00b6 26} Although R.C. 3937.18 specifically includes motor vehicle operators or owners who are immune from liability under R.C. Chapter 2744 within the definition of \u201cuninsured motorist,\u201d see R.C. 3937.18(B)(5), that alone is not dispositive of a policyholder\u2019s right to recover, because the statute does not preclude insurers from adding other conditions to recovery. R.C. 3937.18(1) expressly permits the parties to agree to other specified conditions to, or exclusions from, uninsured/underinsured-motorist coverage. A more accurate <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"248\">*248</page-number>view is that R.C. 3937.18(D) is a default provision, governing in the absence of additional policy provisions requiring more.</p>\n<p id=\"b370-5\">{\u00b6 27} Snyder argues that it would be illogical and inconsistent for R.C. 3937.18(B) to include tortfeasors immune under R.C. Chapter 2744 within the definition of \u201cuninsured motorists\u201d but then also permit policy terms to exclude coverage because of that same immunity. But in revising the statute to remove the mandatory-offering requirement and in seeking to end more than a decade of uncertainty and instability regarding its interpretation and application,<footnotemark>9</footnotemark> it was not illogical for the General Assembly to define statutorily the term \u201cuninsured motorist\u201d as it did but also to provide flexibility for uninsured- and underinsuredmotorist policies to contain additional provisions modifying that definition.</p>\n<p id=\"b370-6\">{\u00b6 28} Had the policy in this case not contained the \u201clegally entitled to recover\u201d language, the police cruiser would have been an uninsured vehicle within the meaning of R.C. 3937.18(B)(5), and, absent another policy condition excluding coverage, Snyder would have been entitled to recover. But this policy did contain an additional condition for coverage, and under the facts of this matter, Snyder did not meet that condition. Similarly, in <em>Estate of Nord v. Motorists Mut. Ins. Co., </em>105 Ohio St.3d 366, 2005-Ohio-2165, 826 N.E.2d 826, we noted that the city of Cleveland, which owned and operated the ambulance in which the insured was injured by a dropped syringe, was immune from liability under R.C. 2744.02, and thus, the ambulance was an \u201cuninsured motor vehicle\u201d by virtue of R.C. 3937.18(B)(5). See id. at fn. 1. Nevertheless, the insured was not entitled to uninsured-motorist benefits because a condition of the policy required the dam<page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"249\">*249</page-number>ages to \u201c \u2018arise out of the ownership, maintenance or use of the uninsured motor vehicle.\u2019 \u201d Id. at \u00b6 12.</p>\n<p id=\"b371-5\">{\u00b6 29} Accordingly, a policy provision limiting the insured\u2019s recovery of uninsured- or underinsured-motorist benefits to amounts which the insured is \u201clegally entitled to recover\u201d is enforceable, and its effect will be to preclude recovery when the tortfeasor is immune under R.C. Chapter 2744.</p>\n<p id=\"b371-6\">C</p>\n<p id=\"b371-7\">{\u00b6 30} For similar reasons, R.C. 3937.18 does not prohibit a policy from precluding uninsured-motorist benefits when the tortfeasor is immune under R.C. 4123.741, which provides for fellow-servant immunity. Because Officer Castro was immune from liability under that statute, the \u201clegally entitled to recover\u201d provision in the American Family policy also prevented Snyder\u2019s recovery of uninsured-motorist benefits arising out of her claim against Castro.</p>\n<p id=\"b371-8\">{\u00b6 31} Nor does R.C. 3937.18(E), which addresses the effect of workers\u2019 compensation on uninsured-motorist/underinsured-motorist recovery, prohibit a tortfeasor\u2019s immunity under R.C. 4123.741 from precluding a claim for uninsured-motorist benefits. <em>Webb, </em>54 Ohio St.3d at 63-64, 562 N.E.2d 132 (construing analogous former R.C. 3937.18(F)).</p>\n<p id=\"b371-9\">Ill</p>\n<p id=\"b371-10\">{\u00b6 32} Snyder\u2019s second proposition of law urges that the phrase \u201clegally entitled to recover,\u201d which is undefined in American Family\u2019s policy, is ambiguous and must be construed strictly against the drafter. <em>King v. Nationwide Ins. Co. </em>(1988), 35 Ohio St.3d 208, 211, 519 N.E.2d 1380. American Family, however, contends that its policy, construed consistently with <em>Webb, </em>is unambiguous and precludes coverage when the uninsured motorist-tortfeasor is immune from liability under R.C. Chapter 2744 or R.C. 4123.741. Upon review, we conclude that the phrase is not ambiguous and must be accorded its plain meaning.</p>\n<p id=\"b371-11\">{\u00b6 33} Despite the statutory changes since <em>Webb </em>was decided, <em>Webb </em>is instructive in considering whether the contractual \u201clegally entitled to recover\u201d provision in the policy has a definite meaning. When <em>Webb </em>was decided, R.C. 3937.18 neither defined nor limited the phrase \u201clegally entitled to recover.\u201d See former R.C. 3937.18, 142 Ohio Laws, Part I, at 1739-1741. In <em>Webb, </em>this court held that fellow-servant immunity under R.C. 4123.741 defeated an insured\u2019s legal right to recover against the tortfeasor. Likewise, a claim for uninsured-motorist benefits for the damages caused by such an uninsured motorist was precluded when the policy required that the insured must be \u201clegally entitled to collect\u201d from the uninsured motorist. See 54 Ohio St.3d at 62, 562 N.E.2d 132. Based on Webb\u2019s construction of the phrase \u201clegally entitled to recover,\u201d we conclude that the phrase in Snyder\u2019s policy is both clear and enforceable. Our ruling here, of <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"250\">*250</page-number>course, does not prevent insurers from responding to consumer demand by offering uninsured-motorist coverage without precluding recovery because of a tortfeasor\u2019s immunity.</p>\n<p id=\"b372-4\">IV</p>\n<p id=\"b372-5\">{\u00b6 34} For all of the foregoing reasons, we hold that R.C. 3937.18, as amended by S.B. 97 in 2001, does not prohibit an uninsured- or underinsured-motorist policy from limiting uninsured-motorist benefits to amounts that the insured is \u201clegally entitled to recover\u201d from the tortfeasor and that such a provision is valid even when it precludes uninsured-motorist benefits for injuries caused by tortfeasors immune under R.C.

The effect of this policy language is to add a contractual condition precedent to uninsured or underinsured motorist (\u201cUM7UIM\u201d) coverage for the policyholder. R.C. 3937.18(D) states, \u201cWith respect to the uninsured motorist coverage, under-insured motorist coverage, or both uninsured and underinsured motorist coverages included in a policy of insurance, <em>an insured shall be required to prove all elements of the insured\u2019s claim that are necessary to recover </em>from the owner or operator of the uninsured or underinsured motor vehicle.\u201d (Emphasis added.) The majority opinion views R.C. 3937.18(D) as merely a \u201cdefault provision\u201d and holds that a policy may restrict UM/UIM coverage to amounts the insured is legally entitled to recover from a tortfeasor when the tortfeasor is \u201cstatutorily immune from liability.\u201d</p>\n<p id=\"b372-11\">{\u00b6 36} This overbroad reading allows an insurer to contract around the definition of \u201cuninsured motorist\u201d; yet the established rule is that policy terms may not contradict statutory requirements.

No. 97, made clear that insurers were no longer obligated to offer UM/UIM coverage as part of a motor-vehicle liability policy. In addition, insurers who now choose to offer UM/UIM coverage within a policy are granted the freedom to limit or exclude UM/UIM coverage under \u201cspecified circumstances.\u201d R.C. 3937.18(1) provides, \u201cAny policy of insurance that includes uninsured motorist coverage, underinsured motorist coverage, or both uninsured and underinsured motorist coverages may include terms and conditions that preclude coverage for bodily injury or death suffered by an insured <em>under specified circumstances </em>* * Five nonexclusive examples of such circumstances follow: (1) while the insured is driving or a passenger in a vehicle with no UM coverage, (2) while the insured is driving or a passenger in a vehicle without permission, (3) when the tortfeasor is specifically excluded from liability coverage, (4) while specified persons are driving or occupying a vehicle other than one covered by the UM policy, or (5) when the person injured or killed is not an insured.</p>\n<p id=\"b373-11\">{\u00b6 43} I cannot agree with the majority view that this section provides \u201cflexibility for uninsured- and underinsured-motorist policies to contain additional provisions modifying [the definition of \u2018uninsured motorist\u2019].\u201d R.C. 3937.18(1) allows an insurer to \u201cinclude terms and conditions that preclude coverage,\u201d but says nothing about modifying statutory definitions. The definition at issue here is contained within R.C. 3937.18(B), which states, in full:</p>\n<p id=\"b373-12\">{\u00b6 44} <em>\u201cFor purposes of any uninsured motorist coverage included in a policy of insurance, an \u2018uninsured motorist\u2019 is the owner or operator of a motor vehicle if </em>any of the following conditions applies:</p>\n<p id=\"b373-13\">{\u00b645} \u201c(1) There exists no bodily injury liability bond or insurance policy covering the owner\u2019s or operator\u2019s liability to the insured.</p>\n<p id=\"b373-14\">{\u00b6 46} \u201c(2) The liability insurer denies coverage to the owner or operator, or is or becomes the subject of insolvency proceedings in any state.</p>\n<p id=\"b373-15\">{\u00b6 47} \u201c(3) The identity of the owner or operator cannot be determined, but independent corroborative evidence exists to prove that the bodily injury, sick<page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"252\">*252</page-number>ness, disease, or death of the insured was proximately caused by the negligence or intentional actions of the unidentified operator of the motor vehicle. For purposes of division (B)(3) of this section, the testimony of any insured seeking recovery from the insurer shall not constitute independent corroborative evidence, unless the testimony is supported by additional evidence.</p>\n<p id=\"b374-5\">{\u00b6 48} \u201c(4) The owner or operator has diplomatic immunity.</p>\n<p id=\"b374-6\">{\u00b6 49} <em>\u201c(5) The owner or operator has immunity under Chapter 27kk. of the Revised Code.</em></p>\n<p id=\"b374-7\">{\u00b6 50} \u201cAn \u201cuninsured motorist\u201d does not include the owner or operator of a motor vehicle that is self-insured within the meaning of the financial responsibility law of the state in which the motor vehicle is registered.\u201d (Emphasis added.)</p>\n<p id=\"b374-8\">{\u00b6 51} For purposes of any UM7UIM insurance coverage then, an \u201cuninsured motorist\u201d is the \u201cowner or operator\u201d of a motor vehicle who is not covered by a bodily injury liability bond or similar insurance, or whose insurance company denies coverage or is insolvent, or who is a \u201chit-and-run driver,\u201d or who is protected by diplomatic immunity or governmental immunity under R.C. Chapter 2744. Accordingly, Officer Castro was an uninsured motorist pursuant to R.C. 3937.18(B)(5).</p>\n<p id=\"b374-9\">{\u00b6 52} Applying the policy\u2019s restriction against Officer Castro contradicts the statute. The majority recognizes this effect by stating, \u201cHad the policy in this case not contained the \u2018legally entitled to recover\u2019 language, <em>the police cmiser would have been an uninsured vehicle within the meaning of R.C. 3937.18(B)(5), </em>and, absent another policy condition excluding coverage, Snyder would have been entitled to recover.\u201d (Emphasis added.)</p>\n<p id=\"b374-10\">{\u00b6 53} By considering the term \u201clegally entitled to recover\u201d as a \u201cspecified circumstance\u201d under R.C. 3937.18(1), the majority allows the insurance contract to invalidate the plain language of R.C. 3937.18(B)(5). Application of the term \u201clegally entitled to recover\u201d to exclude from UM coverage an owner or operator of a motor vehicle who has immunity under R.C. Chapter 2744 would vitiate R.C. 3937.18(B)(5)\u2019s definition of \u201cuninsured motorist,\u201d a definition that is set forth for purposes of <em>\u201cany </em>uninsured motorist coverage.\u201d</p>\n<p id=\"b374-11\">{\u00b6 54} It is unnecessary to resurrect <em>State Farm Mut. Auto. Ins. Co. v. Webb </em>(1990), 54 Ohio St.3d 61, 562 N.E.2d 132, to delve into the meaning of the phrase \u201clegally entitled to recover.\u201d Owners and operators with governmental immunity under R.C. Chapter 2744 (R.C. 3937.18(B)(5)) and diplomatic immunity (under R.C. 3937.18(B)(4)) remain among those to be considered as \u201cuninsured motorists\u201d for purposes of UM/UIM coverage. Officer Castro and her employer both qualify as uninsured motorists by definition, since both are protected by R.C. Chapter 2744. Snyder should therefore be entitled to recover UM benefits under <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"253\">*253</page-number>her own policy. I would hold that the policy term \u201clegally entitled to recover\u201d may not be applied to void the definition of an owner or operator who has immunity under R.C. Chapter 2744.</p>\n<attorneys id=\"Aqg\">Lamkin, Van Eman, Trimble, Beals, &amp; Dougherty, L.L.C., Timothy L. Van Ern\u00e1n, and Keri N.

If Officer Castro were merely a \u201cfellow servant\u201d and an employee of a nongovernmental employer, R.C. Chapter 2744 would not apply. Were Snyder to then sue Castro for an injury occurring in the course and scope of their employment, application of the policy term \u201clegally entitled to recover\u201d would not contradict the UM/UIM statutes because an owner or operator with fellow-servant immunity is not specifically defined as an \u201cuninsured motorist\u201d within R.C. 3937.18(B). In other words, the policy phrase \u201clegally entitled to recover\u201d would not contradict the General Assembly\u2019s intent to grant tortfeasors with diplomatic or sovereign immunity the status of uninsured motorists for UM/UIM coverage.</p>\n<p id=\"b375-8\">{\u00b6 56} I therefore respectfully dissent and would reverse the judgment of the court of appeals.</p>\n<judges id=\"b375-9\">Pfeifer, J., concurs in the foregoing opinion.</judges>\n</opinion>\n</casebody>\n",
