Eggelston. Eggelston was injured at work in 1999, and a workers\u2019 compensation claim was allowed for \u201ccervical strain/sprain; thoracic strain/sprain; lumbosacral strain/sprain; aggravation degenerative discs L-4, L-5.\u201d The Industrial Commission of Ohio awarded Eggelston temporary total disability benefits. In 2004, she moved for an additional allowance for aggravation of pre-existing disc degeneration, additional temporary total disability compensation, and wage-loss compensation.</p>\n<p id=\"b193-8\">{\u00b6 2} In response to these motions, reports were submitted by Dr. Sushil M. Sethi, an independent medical examiner, and Dr. Michael R. Viau, Eggelston\u2019s personal physician. Dr. Sethi examined Eggelston on May 24, 2004. He opined that Eggelston had reached maximum medical improvement. He acknowledged the presence of degenerative changes, but attributed them to the aging process and did not believe that they were aggravated by the industrial injury. Dr. Sethi concluded that overall, Eggelston\u2019s physical findings did not substantiate her subjective complaints and that any back symptoms that might exist were unrelated to her industrial injury.</p>\n<p id=\"b193-9\">{\u00b6 3} Dr. Viau submitted three reports on commission forms. On April 30, 2004, Dr. Viau attributed all of Eggelston\u2019s symptoms to an \u201c[aggravation of preexisting disc degeneration L-3,4 and L-2,3,\u201d a diagnosis that had nothing to do with Eggelston\u2019s workers\u2019 compensation claim. The report did not mention any of Eggelston\u2019s allowed conditions as causative or contributing factors. In a <em>June </em>28, 2004 report, however, Dr. Viau attributed Eggelston\u2019s problems exclusively to \u201clumbosacral sprain/strain,\u201d with no mention of the degenerative condition discussed so prominently two months before.</p>\n<p id=\"b193-10\">{\u00b6 4} The third report from Dr. Viau, on June 18, 2004, released Eggelston to part-time light-duty work. Curiously, the June 28 report \u2014 which was generated by the same examination \u2014 said that Eggelston could do no work whatsoever.</p>\n<p id=\"b193-11\">{\u00b6 5} On July 12, 2004, commission hearing officers issued two orders. One specifically disallowed Eggelston\u2019s claim for \u201caggravation of pre-existing disc degeneration at L2, 3 [and] aggravation of pre-existing disc degeneration at L34.\u201d In that order, the commission relied on Dr. Sethi and concluded that \u201cthe present symptomatology is not related to the 11/22/99 injury by way of either <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"72\">*72</page-number>causation, aggravation, or flow through.\u201d The other order denied further temporary total disability compensation based on a finding of maximum medical improvement. Those orders became final.</p>\n<p id=\"b194-5\">(\u00b6 6} On December 20, 2004, the commission granted Eggelston\u2019s wage-loss application, based in part on Dr. Viau\u2019s June 18, 2004 report. BMC unsuccessfully objected administratively and then turned to the Court of Appeals for Franklin County.</p>\n<p id=\"b194-6\">(\u00b6 7} BMC objected to the commission\u2019s reliance on Dr. Viau, claiming that inconsistencies among the three Viau reports disqualified all three from evidentiary consideration. The court of appeals disagreed and denied a writ of mandamus, prompting BMC\u2019s appeal to this court as of right.</p>\n<p id=\"b194-7\">{\u00b6 8} Our review of the medical evidence reveals a confusing series of reports that are alternately complementary and contradictory. The commission\u2019s December 20, 2004 order suggests that the hearing officer may have been equally perplexed by the evidence, and, for this reason, we vacate the order and order the commission to consider the claim further and issue an amended order.</p>\n<p id=\"b194-8\">{\u00b6 9} Dr. Viau\u2019s June 18, 2004 examination generated the conclusions that Eggelston could do no work (June 28) and could do part-time work (June 18). Dr. Viau also attributed Eggelston\u2019s symptoms exclusively to nonallowed conditions on April 30 and exclusively to allowed conditions on June 28. Into this mix is added Dr. Sethi\u2019s May 24, 2004 report, which concludes that Eggelston\u2019s symptoms are unrelated to her workplace injury \u2014 a report and conclusion that the commission expressly adopted in one of its July 12, 2004 orders.</p>\n<p id=\"b194-9\">{\u00b6 10} The December 20, 2004 commission order currently at issue relied on Dr. Viau\u2019s report that permitted part-time work. The order does not indicate whether the hearing officer was aware that the same examination that generated the conclusion that Eggelston could work also generated the conclusion that she could not.</p>\n<p id=\"b194-10\">{\u00b6 11} The hearing officer also claims that the July 12, 2004 order did not state \u201cthat the 1999 injury had resolved.\u201d While the July order did not use those exact words, it did say that Eggelston\u2019s \u201cpresent symptomatology is not related to the 11/22/1999 injury by way of either causation, aggravation, or flow-through.\u201d This certainly suggests that residuals from the allowed conditions no longer exist.</p>\n<p id=\"b194-11\">{\u00b6 12} We therefore find a sufficient lack of clarity to warrant an order to the commission to consider the claim further and issue an amended order. Accordingly, the judgment of the court of appeals is reversed.</p>\n<p id=\"b194-12\">Judgment reversed and limited writ granted.</p>\n<judges id=\"b195-4\"><page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"73\">*73</page-number>Moyer, C.J., Pfeifer, Lundberg Stratton, O\u2019Connor, O\u2019Donnell and Cupp, JJ., concur.</judges>\n<judges id=\"b195-5\">Lanzinger, J., concurs separately.</judges>\n</opinion>\n<opinion data-order=\"6\" data-type=\"opinion\" id=\"x999-2\" type=\"concurrence\">\n<author id=\"b195-6\">Lanzinger, J.,</author>\n<p id=\"A5B\">concurring.</p>\n<p id=\"b195-7\">{\u00b6 13} In this direct appeal, appellant-employer, Baja Marine Corporation (\u201cBaja\u201d), seeks a writ of mandamus ordering appellee Industrial Commission of Ohio to vacate a December 20, 2004 order granting nonworking wage-loss compensation to Cynthia S. Eggelston.</p>\n<p id=\"b195-8\">Case Procedure</p>\n<p id=\"b195-9\">{\u00b6 14} Eggelston, employed as an inspector for Baja, lost her footing and twisted her back while stepping out of a boat on November 22, 1999. Her workers\u2019 compensation claim was initially allowed for \u201ccervical strain/sprain; thoracic strain/sprain; lumbosacral strain/sprain.\u201d An additional condition of \u201caggravation of pre-existing degenerative discs L-4,-5\u201d was recognized, and Eggelston was awarded temporary total disability benefits for her allowed conditions from the day after her injury.</p>\n<p id=\"b195-10\">{\u00b6 15} On April 1, 2004, Eggelston filed a motion seeking an additional allowance for aggravation of pre-existing disc degeneration at L2-3 and L3-4. Even though her personal doctor, Dr. Michael R. Yiau, had given his opinion that the work injury directly and proximately caused the alleged aggravation, this opinion was not recognized. Instead, the commission relied on the May 24, 2004 medical report of Dr. Sushil M. Sethi, an independent examiner, who reviewed Eggelston\u2019s medical file and examined her. Dr. Sethi concluded that Eggelston\u2019s work injuries had resolved and that any work restrictions were due to a preexisting degenerative disc disease. The appeal from the commission\u2019s order disallowing the aggravation was denied, and the order became final.</p>\n<p id=\"b195-11\">{\u00b6 16} Based on Dr. Sethi\u2019s conclusions that Eggelston had reached maximum medical improvement, Baja filed a motion to terminate temporary total disability. On June 18, 2004, while Baja\u2019s motion was pending, Dr. Viau examined Eggelston. He filled out a C-140 medical report, which stated that Eggelston was capable of working four hours per day, five days per week with specific permanent restrictions. Ten days later, Dr. Viau completed a C-84 report based upon the same June 18 physical examination, giving the contrary opinion that Eggelston could <em>not </em>return to any \u201clight duty, alternative work, modified work, or transitional work.\u201d</p>\n<p id=\"b195-12\">{\u00b6 17} Dr. Sethi also submitted a June 28 supplemental report after further reviewing the medical records. He reaffirmed that Eggelston\u2019s 1999 work injury <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"74\">*74</page-number>had resolved itself and that her ongoing symptoms were caused by pre-existing degenerative disease. He concluded, \u201cThere is no causal relationship with the present symptomatology or alleged diagnoses as mentioned to the 11-22-1999 injury by way of causation, aggravation or flow through.\u201d</p>\n<p id=\"b196-5\">{\u00b6 18} Eggelston\u2019s wage-loss application, the subject of this appeal, was approved on December 20, 2004. Baja unsuccessfully objected administratively and was unsuccessful in its appeal to the Court of Appeals for Franklin County. The court of appeals, not agreeing with Baja that the inconsistencies within Dr. Viau\u2019s reports disqualified them from evidentiary consideration, denied a writ of mandamus, prompting Baja\u2019s appeal to this court as of right.</p>\n<p id=\"b196-6\">Legal Argument</p>\n<p id=\"b196-7\">{\u00b6 19} Baja strenuously argues that the commission erred in relying on Dr. Viau\u2019s opinions to award Eggelston nonworking wage loss and relies on <em>State ex rel. Eberhardt v. Flxible Corp. </em>(1994), 70 Ohio St.3d 649, 640 N.E.2d 815, and <em>State ex rel. M. Weingold &amp; Co. v. Indus. Comm., </em>97 Ohio St.3d 44, 2002-Ohio-5353, 776 N.E.2d 69. Both cases stand for the proposition that contrary medical opinions by a physician are not evidence and cannot support an award of workers\u2019 compensation.</p>\n<p id=\"b196-8\">{\u00b6 20} In <em>Eberhardt, </em>we held that the commission abused its discretion in denying temporary total disability based on a physician\u2019s report that stated that the claimant had reached maximum medical improvement while also suggesting that the condition could improve with therapy. We held also that the commission abused its discretion in relying on this doctor\u2019s opinion. <em>Eberhardt, </em>70 Ohio St.3d at 657, 640 N.E.2d 815, and at paragraph one of the syllabus.</p>\n<p id=\"b196-9\">{\u00b6 21} In <em>Weingold, </em>we concluded specifically that inconsistent evaluations based on the same examination could not be \u201csome evidence\u201d on which an award could be based. \u201cWe have held that internally inconsistent doctor\u2019s reports cannot be \u2018some evidence\u2019 supporting a commission decision. <em>State ex. rel. Lopez v. Indus. Comm. </em>(1994), 69 Ohio St.3d 445, 633 N.E.2d 528. By extension, substantial inconsistencies between two C84s generated by the same examination compel the same result.\u201d <em>Weingold, </em>97 Ohio St.3d 44, 2002-Ohio-5353, 776 N.E.2d 69, \u00b6 12.</p>\n<p id=\"b196-10\">{\u00b6 22} Here, the court of appeals recognized that the commission\u2019s award of nonworking wage loss rested on the opinions of Dr. Viau. <em>Baja, </em>2006-Ohio-1646, 2006 WL 832521, \u00b6 3-4, 6. Dr. Viau\u2019s single examination of Eggelston on June 18, 2004, generated contrary conclusions. The June 18 C-140 report states that Eggelston can do part-time work four hours a day, five days a week, and can stand for two hours during an eight-hour day; can occasionally bend and squat, frequently reach and lift up to ten pounds; and can occasionally lift up to 20 <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"75\">*75</page-number>pounds. Yet based on the same examination, Dr. Viau later checked a box on the C-84 report that Eggelston is <em>not </em>\u201cable to return to other employment including light duty, alternative work, modified work or transitional work.\u201d</p>\n<p id=\"b197-5\">{\u00b6 23} Dr. Viau also contradicted himself in attributing Eggelston\u2019s symptoms exclusively to nonallowed conditions on April 30 but exclusively to allowed conditions in his June 28 report. On the C-30 questionnaire Dr. Viau indicated that Eggelston\u2019s diagnosis was \u201c[aggravation of pre-existing disc degeneration L-3,4 and L-2,3.\u201d This diagnosis did not mention any of Eggelston\u2019s allowed conditions as causing or contributing to her symptoms. However, in his June 28 report, Dr. Viau attributed Eggelston\u2019s problems exclusively to \u201cLumbosacral Sprain/Strain,\u201d an allowed condition, without referring to the degenerative condition he discussed on April 30.</p>\n<p id=\"b197-6\">{\u00b624} The December 20, 2004 commission order indicates that the staff hearing officer \u201crelies on the C-140 report of Dr. Viau, dated 6/18/2004, which limits the injured worker to part-time (four to five hours per day) light duty work, on a permanent basis.\u201d The order does not mention Dr. Viau\u2019s contradictory opinion, based upon the same physical examination, that Eggelston was not able to work at all. Dr. Sethi\u2019s June 28, 2004 amended report, offered by Baja, was discounted on the grounds that it related only to the issue of the termination of temporary total disability.</p>\n<p id=\"b197-7\">{\u00b6 25} In summary, the commission based its order on one opinion of Eggelston\u2019s treating physician, without considering his contradictory findings made on the same examination. In <em>Eberhardt, </em>we explained:</p>\n<p id=\"b197-8\">{\u00b626} \u201c[EJquivocal medical opinions are not evidence. * * * Such opinions are of no probative value. Further, equivocation occurs when a doctor repudiates an earlier opinion, renders contradictory or uncertain opinions, or fails to clarify an ambiguous statement.</p>\n<p id=\"b197-9\">{\u00b6 27} \u201c * * *</p>\n<p id=\"b197-10\">{\u00b6 28} \u201cRepudiated, contradictory or uncertain statements reveal that the doctor is not sure what he means and, therefore, they are inherently unreliable.\u201d <em>Eberhardt, </em>70 Ohio St.3d at 657, 640 N.E.2d 815.</p>\n<p id=\"b197-11\">{\u00b6 29} In the case at bar, Dr. Viau\u2019s opinions were contradictory on the issue of whether Eggelston was able or unable to work at light or modified duty. I concur in the reversal of the judgment of the court of appeals, but would hold that the commission abused its discretion by awarding nonworking wage-loss compensation based on insufficient evidence. I would grant the writ requested and vacate the December 20, 2004 order.</p>\n<judges id=\"b197-12\">O\u2019Connor, J., concurs in the foregoing opinion.</judges>\n<attorneys id=\"AXL\"><page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"76\">*76</page-number>Moscarino &amp; Treu, L.L.P., Michael J.
