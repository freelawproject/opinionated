Voter approval of Issue 1 added Section 11, Article XV to the Ohio Constitution. Section 11 states: \u201cOnly a union between one man and one woman may be a marriage valid in or recognized by this state and its political subdivisions. This state and its political subdivisions shall not create or recognize a legal status for relationships of unmarried individuals that intends to approximate the design, qualities, significance or effect of marriage.\u201d</p>\n<p id=\"b332-16\">{\u00b6 3} Appellant, Michael Carswell, was indicted on one count of domestic violence in violation of R.C. 2919.25(A), which provides: \u201cNo person shall knowingly cause or attempt to cause physical harm to a family or household member.\u201d The alleged victim was a female to whom Carswell was not married. The state intended to present evidence that Carswell\u2019s alleged victim had been <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"211\">*211</page-number>\u201cliving as a spouse\u201d with Carswell and that she was therefore a \u201cfamily or household member\u201d under R.C. 2919.25(F).</p>\n<p id=\"b333-6\">{\u00b6 4} The trial court granted Carswell\u2019s motion to dismiss the indictment, concluding that the domestic-violence statute violated Section 11, Article XV of the Ohio Constitution, because the statute recognized a legal status similar to marriage for unmarried persons. The court of appeals reversed, holding that while the statute does create a special class of unmarried persons living together as a spouse, this classification did not create a legal status akin to marriage.</p>\n<p id=\"b333-7\">{\u00b6 5} We accepted Carswell\u2019s discretionary appeal.</p>\n<p id=\"b333-8\">{\u00b6 6} We begin our analysis with the established rule that statutes are presumed to be constitutional. <em>Desenco, Inc. v. Akron </em>(1999), 84 Ohio St.3d 535, 538, 706 N.E.2d 323. Carswell argues that this presumption does not apply to the statute at issue in the case at bar, because R.C. 2919.25 was adopted prior to voter approval of Section 11, Article XV, and so, in drafting the statute, the General Assembly could not have tried to conform the statute to the constitution. That fact, however, does not remove the presumption of validity in this case, because the general rule as to the interpretation of constitutional amendments is that \u201c \u2018[t]he body enacting the amendment will be presumed to have had in mind existing constitutional or statutory provisions and their judicial construction, touching the subject dealt with.\u2019 \u201d <em>State ex rel. Lake Cty. Bd. of Commrs. v. Zupancic </em>(1991), 62 Ohio St.3d 297, 303, 581 N.E.2d 1086 (Moyer, C.J., dissenting), quoting <em>State ex rel. Engle v. Indus. Comm. </em>(1944), 142 Ohio St. 425, 432, 27 O.O. 370, 52 N.E.2d 743. We proceed with the presumption, notwithstanding the absence of any empirical data to support it, that the drafters of the proposed constitutional amendment and the voters who approved it knew of the domestic-violence statute and that its purpose is the protection of persons from acts of domestic violence.</p>\n<p id=\"b333-9\">{\u00b6 7} The strong presumption of constitutionality is supported by another principle: \u201cBefore we can declare a statute unconstitutional, \u2018 \u201cit must appear beyond a reasonable doubt that the legislation and constitutional provisions are clearly incompatible.\u201d \u2019 \u201d <em>Desenco, </em>84 Ohio St.3d at 538, 706 N.E.2d 323, quoting <em>Doyle v. Ohio Bur. of Motor Vehicles (1990), </em>51 Ohio St.3d 46, 47, 554 N.E.2d 97, quoting <em>State ex rel. Dickman v. Defenbacher </em>(1955), 164 Ohio St. 142, 57 O.O. 134, 128 N.E.2d 59, paragraph one of the syllabus.</p>\n<p id=\"b333-10\">{\u00b6 8} Issue 1 did not explicitly repeal R.C. 2919.25. Therefore, if we are to conclude that R.C. 2919.25 was repealed by Issue 1, we must conclude that it was repealed by implication, but we have held that such a finding is disfavored. This court has repeatedly held that repeals by implication are disfavored as a matter of judicial policy. <em>State ex rel. Kelley v. Clearcreek Local School Dist. Bd. of Edn. </em>(1990), 52 Ohio St.3d 93, 95, 556 N.E.2d 173 (\u201crepeals by implication are <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"212\">*212</page-number>disfavored as a matter of judicial policy\u201d); see, also, <em>State ex rel. Specht v. Painesville Twp. Local School Dist. Bd. of Edn. </em>(1980), 63 Ohio St.2d 146, 148, 17 O.O.3d 89, 407 N.E.2d 20.</p>\n<p id=\"b334-5\">{\u00b6 9} Addressing whether certain statutes were repealed by the constitution of 1851, we held, \u201cThe rule, that repeals by implication are not favored, is applicable to the inquiry whether any particular enactment has ceased to be in force on account of repugnancy to the new constitution. * * * The repugnancy which must cause the law to fall, must be necessary and obvious; if by any fair course of reasoning, the law and the constitution can be reconciled, the law must stand.\u201d <em>Cass v. Dillon </em>(1853), 2 Ohio St. 607, 608; for same holding with regard to the Constitution of 1912, see <em>State v. Cameron </em>(1914), 89 Ohio St. 214, 106 N.E. 28, paragraph two of the syllabus, overruled in part on other grounds by <em>Eastman v. State </em>(1936), 131 Ohio St. 1, 5 O.O. 248, 1 N.E.2d 140, paragraph 12 of the syllabus. Thus, R.C. 2919.25 is unconstitutional only if it is clearly incompatible and irreconcilable with Section 11, Article XV.</p>\n<p id=\"b334-6\">{\u00b6 10} In determining whether a statute and a constitutional provision are clearly incompatible, we use the plain and ordinary meaning of the words in question and attempt to reconcile the words of the statute with the terms of the constitution whenever possible. <em>Zupancic, </em>62 Ohio St.3d at 300, 581 N.E.2d 1086 (\u201cA long-standing rule of construction mandates that we consider the common and ordinary meaning of the terms contained within our Constitution in order to interpret them properly\u201d); <em>Desenco, </em>84 Ohio St.3d at 538, 706 N.E.2d 323 (\u201cCourts have a duty to liberally construe statutes in order to save them from constitutional infirmities\u201d).</p>\n<p id=\"b334-7\">{\u00b6 11} We consider first the terms of the constitutional provision. The first sentence of Section 11, Article XV, prohibits the state from recognizing as a marriage any union between persons other than one man and one woman. That constitutional prohibition is clear and is not at issue in this case. At issue is the second sentence of Section 11, Article XV, which bars the state from creating or recognizing a legal status for unmarried persons that \u201cintends to approximate the design, qualities, significance or effect of marriage.\u201d This appeal requires this court to determine whether the indictment of Carswell for knowingly causing or attempting to cause physical harm to a \u201cperson living as a spouse\u201d with him is vitiated because the statute under which he was indicted conflicts with the provision of Section 11, Article XV that prohibits the state from creating or recognizing a legal status for unmarried persons that approximates marriage.</p>\n<p id=\"b334-8\">{\u00b6 12} The term \u201clegal status\u201d is not defined in the amendment, nor is it defined in the case law of this court. A dictionary definition of the term \u201cstatus\u201d is succinctly stated as \u201c[a] person\u2019s legal condition, whether personal or proprietary; the sum total of a person\u2019s legal rights, duties, liabilities, and other legal <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"213\">*213</page-number>relations.\u201d Black\u2019s Law Dictionary (8th Ed.2004) 1447. Even more concisely, the term \u201cstatus\u201d is defined as \u201c[t]he standing of a person before the law.\u201d Random House Dictionary of the English Language (2d Ed.1987) 1862.</p>\n<p id=\"b335-6\">{\u00b6 13} Under these definitions, being married is a status. Marriage gives individuals a standing before the law. Being married gives a person certain legal rights, duties, and liabilities. For example, a married person may not testify against his or her spouse in some situations. R.C. 2945.42. A married person may inherit property from a spouse who dies intestate. R.C. 2105.06. The definition of \u201cstatus,\u201d our understanding of the legal responsibilities of marriage, and the rights and duties created by the status of being married, combined with the first sentence of the amendment\u2019s prohibition against recognizing any union that is between persons other than one man and one woman, cause us to conclude that the second sentence of the amendment means that the state cannot create or recognize a legal status for unmarried persons that bears all of the attributes of marriage \u2014 a marriage substitute.</p>\n<p id=\"b335-7\">{\u00b6 14} When we construe constitutional provisions, \u201cthe intent of the framers is controlling. If the meaning of a provision cannot be ascertained by its plain language, a court may look to the purpose of the provision to determine its meaning.\u201d <em>State v. Jackson, </em>102 Ohio St.3d 380, 2004-Ohio-3206, 811 N.E.2d 68, \u00b6 14, citing <em>Castleberry v. Evatt </em>(1946), 147 Ohio St. 30, 33 O.O. 197, 67 N.E.2d 861, paragraph one of the syllabus.</p>\n<p id=\"b335-8\">{\u00b6 15} It is clear that the purpose of Issue 1 was to prevent the state, either through legislative, executive, or judicial action, from creating or recognizing a legal status deemed to be the equivalent of a marriage of a man and a woman. The first sentence of the amendment prohibits the recognition of marriage between persons other than one man and one woman. The second sentence of the amendment prohibits the state and its political subdivisions from circumventing the mandate of the first sentence by recognizing a legal status similar to marriage (for example, a civil union).<footnotemark>1</footnotemark></p>\n<p id=\"b336-4\"><page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"214\">*214</page-number>{\u00b6 16} We next consider whether the prohibitions in Section 11, Article XV, prohibit the state from prosecuting an alleged violation of R.C. 2919.25 when an element to be proved is that the accused is \u201cliving as a spouse\u201d with the alleged victim. R.C.2919.25 states:</p>\n<p id=\"b336-5\">{\u00b6 17} \u201c(A) No person shall knowingly cause or attempt to cause physical harm to a family or household member.</p>\n<p id=\"b336-6\">{\u00b6 18} \u201c(B) No person shall recklessly cause serious physical harm to a family or household member.</p>\n<p id=\"b336-7\">{\u00b6 19} \u201c(C) No person, by threat of force, shall knowingly cause a family or household member to believe that the offender will cause imminent physical harm to the family or household member.</p>\n<p id=\"b336-8\">{\u00b6 20} \u201c(D)(1) Whoever violates this section is guilty of domestic violence.\u201d</p>\n<p id=\"b336-9\">{\u00b6 21} R.C. 2919.25(F) defines the term \u201cfamily or household member\u201d:</p>\n<p id=\"b336-10\">{\u00b6 22} \u201c(1) \u2018Family or household member\u2019 means any of the following:</p>\n<p id=\"b336-11\">{\u00b623} \u201c(a) Any of the following who is residing or has resided with the offender:</p>\n<p id=\"b336-12\">{\u00b6 24} \u201c(i) A spouse, a person living as a spouse, or a former spouse of the offender;</p>\n<p id=\"b336-13\">{\u00b6 25} \u201c(ii) A parent or a child of the offender, or another person related by consanguinity or affinity to the offender;</p>\n<p id=\"b336-14\">{\u00b6 26} \u201c(iii) A parent or a child of a spouse, person living as a spouse, or former spouse of the offender, or another person related by consanguinity or affinity to a spouse, person living as a spouse, or former spouse of the offender.</p>\n<p id=\"b337-5\"><page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"215\">*215</page-number>{\u00b6 27} \u201c(b) The natural parent of any child of whom the offender is the other natural parent or is the putative other natural parent.</p>\n<p id=\"b337-6\">{\u00b6 28} \u201c(2) \u2018Person living as a spouse\u2019 means a person who is living or has lived with the offender in a common law marital relationship, who otherwise is cohabiting with the offender, or who otherwise has cohabited with the offender within five years prior to the date of the alleged commission of the act in question.\u201d</p>\n<p id=\"b337-7\">{\u00b6 29} The statute distinguishes domestic violence from assault. The conduct of the accused is the same in both instances. Both crimes prohibit the act of \u201cknowingly causing] or attempting] to cause physical harm,\u201d but the accused\u2019s relationship with the victim is the determining element. Physical harm caused to <em>another </em>is an assault, R.C. 2903.13; physical harm caused to a <em>family or household member </em>is domestic violence, R.C. 2919.25.</p>\n<p id=\"b337-8\">{\u00b6 30} \u201c \u2018The General Assembly enacted the domestic violence statutes specifically to criminalize those activities commonly known as domestic violence * * *.\u2019</p>\n<p id=\"b337-9\">{\u00b6 31} \u201cIn contrast to \u2018stranger\u2019 violence, domestic violence arises out of the <em>relationship </em>between the perpetrator and the victim.\u201d (Emphasis sic.) <em>State v. Williams </em>(1997), 79 Ohio St.3d 459, 462, 683 N.E.2d 1126, quoting <em>Felton v. Felton </em>(1997), 79 Ohio St.3d 34, 37, 679 N.E.2d 672.</p>\n<p id=\"b337-10\">{\u00b6 32} The distinction between the two offenses is important because of the large class of potential victims created by R.C. 2919.25(F). The General Assembly clearly intended to offer protections to a wide class of persons. In addition to the contested classification of a \u201cperson living as a spouse,\u201d the statute recognizes at least 11 other classifications of specific victims: spouse, former spouse, a parent, a child, a blood relative (consanguinity), an in-law (affinity), the parent of a spouse or former spouse, the child of a spouse or former spouse, a blood relative or in-law of a spouse or former spouse, and the natural parent of a child who is also the issue of the offender. R.C. 2919.25(F)(1).</p>\n<p id=\"b337-11\">{\u00b6 33} R.C. 2919.25 does not create any special or additional rights, privileges, or benefits for family or household members. Any legal benefits that these persons might possess (such as a right to inherit property through intestacy) are derived from other statutory provisions, not from the person\u2019s status as a family or household member in the domestic-violence statute. Additionally, each subset of potential victims has different rights or duties in other statutory provisions. For example, spouses have many other rights and duties, while former spouses do not. By the plain language of the statute, R.C. 2919.25 creates a subset of victims, separate from the generic term \u201canother\u201d in the assault statute; it does not bestow additional rights, duties, or liabilities. <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"216\">*216</page-number>{\u00b6 34} The specific statutory category that Carswell argues violates the constitution is the \u201cperson living as a spouse\u201d category. The statute says that \u201cperson living as a spouse\u201d means \u201ca person who is * * * cohabitating with the offender, or who * * * has cohabitated with the offender within five years\u201d of the alleged crime.</p>\n<p id=\"b338-5\">{\u00b6 35} The statute does not define \u201ccohabitation,\u201d but we have construed the term in this statute as follows: \u201cThe essential elements of \u2018cohabitation\u2019 are (1) sharing of familial or financial responsibilities and (2) consortium.\u201d <em>State v. Williams </em>(1997), 79 Ohio St.3d 459, 683 N.E.2d 1126, paragraph two of the syllabus. We further explained, \u201cFactors that might establish consortium include mutual respect, fidelity, affection, society, cooperation, solace, comfort, aid of each other, friendship, and conjugal relations.\u201d Id. at 465, 683 N.E.2d 1126. The state does not create cohabitation; rather it is a person\u2019s determination to share some measure of life\u2019s responsibilities with another that creates cohabitation. The state does not have a role in creating cohabitation, but it does have a role in creating a marriage. See R.C. 3101.01 et seq. The state played no role in creating Carswell\u2019s relationship with the alleged victim. Carswell created that relationship.</p>\n<p id=\"b338-6\">{\u00b6 36} While the intent of the domestic-violence statute is to protect persons from violence by close family members or residents of the same household, the intent of the marriage amendment was to prevent the creation or recognition of a legal status that approximates marriage through judicial, legislative, or executive action. The statute and the constitution are not in conflict.</p>\n<p id=\"b338-7\">{\u00b6 37} We hold, therefore, that the term \u201cperson living as a spouse\u201d as defined in R.C. 2919.25 merely identifies a particular class of persons for the purposes of the domestic-violence statutes. It does not create or recognize a legal relationship that approximates the designs, qualities, or significance of marriage as prohibited by Section 11, Article XV of the Ohio Constitution. Persons who satisfy the \u201cliving as a spouse\u201d category are not provided any of the rights, benefits, or duties of marriage. A \u201cperson living as a spouse\u201d is simply a classification with significance to only domestic-violence statutes. Thus, R.C. 2919.25 is not unconstitutional and does not create a quasi-marital relationship in violation of Section 11, Article XV of the Ohio Constitution.</p>\n<p id=\"b338-8\">Judgment affirmed.</p>\n<judges id=\"b338-9\">French, Lundberg Stratton, O\u2019Connor and O\u2019Donnell, JJ., concur.</judges>\n<judges id=\"b338-10\">Pfeifer, J., concurs in syllabus and judgment only.</judges>\n<judges id=\"b338-11\">Lanzinger, J., dissents.</judges>\n<judges id=\"b339-3\"><page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"217\">*217</page-number>Judith L.

Dept. of Public Health, </em>440 Mass. 309, 798 N.E.2d 941 (2003). In response, the Ohio General Assembly amended Revised Code Section 3101.01, effective 5-07-04 in 2004 H 272. RC 3101.01(A) now specifies that \u2018A marriage may only be entered into by one man and one woman\u2019 (thereby expressly foreclosing polygamy as well as same-gender unions). While Revised Code Section 3101.01(C)(1) now provides that same-gender marriage is against the strong public policy of this State and is void ab initio, with no legal force or effect.</p>\n<p id=\"b335-10\">{Kb} \u201cIn contemplation of the possible effect in Ohio of marriages between the same gender authorized by another State such as Massachusetts, the General Assembly by RC 3101.01(C)(2) took the approach that such marriages \u2018shall be considered and treated in all respects as having no legal <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"214\">*214</page-number>force or effect in this state and shall not be recognized by this state.\u2019 Finally, regarding benefits for government employees, RC 3101.01(C)(3) provides that recognition or extension by the State of statutory benefits of a legal marriage to non-marital relationships between persons of the same or different genders \u2018is against the strong public policy of this state.\u2019 In other words, the General Assembly expressed its intent that such benefits for marriage partners should not be conferred upon individuals cohabiting out of wedlock, whatever their gender. To further emphasize its intent in enacting the legislation, the General Assembly passed uncodified law stating that substitutes for marriage such as \u2018civil unions\u2019 shall not be recognized in Ohio.</p>\n<p id=\"b336-16\">{\u00b6 c} \u201cSome citizens expressed concern following these amendments that State or federal courts could rule that RC 3101.02 violates the equal protection guarantees of the Ohio Constitution, after the example of the Massachusetts court. To foreclose that possibility, the 2004 amendment to the Constitution was proposed by petition, for the purpose of writing into the fundamental law of the State the principles enacted in RC 3101.01. The amendment reiterates the statutory condition that marriage is a union between one man and one woman, and proceeds to mandate that the State and its political subdivisions shall not create or recognize any \u2018legal status\u2019 that \u2018intends to approximate * * * marriage\u2019 for unmarried individuals.\u201d Editor\u2019s Comment to Section 11, Article XV, in 2007 Pocket Part to Baldwin\u2019s Ohio Revised Code Annotated (2007).</p>\n</footnote>\n</opinion>\n<opinion data-order=\"6\" data-type=\"opinion\" id=\"x999-2\" type=\"dissent\">\n<author id=\"b339-5\">Lanzinger, J.,</author>\n<p id=\"AGM\">dissenting.</p>\n<p id=\"b339-6\">{\u00b6 38} Because of an understandable need to uphold the domestic violence statute as it is currently written and to avoid the unintended consequences that result from the passage of Section 11, Article XV of the Ohio Constitution, the majority misinterprets the amendment, thus saving the statute from being declared unconstitutional. I respectfully dissent.</p>\n<p id=\"b339-7\">{\u00b6 39} The disputed portion of Section 11, Article XV is the second sentence, which says: \u201cThis state and its political subdivisions shall not create or recognize a legal status for relationships of unmarried individuals that intends to approximate the design, qualities, significance or effect of marriage.\u201d I believe that this language implicitly repeals the domestic violence statute insofar as it applies to \u201cperson[s] living as * * * spouse[s].\u201d</p>\n<p id=\"b339-8\">Legal Status under the Domestic Violence Statute</p>\n<p id=\"b339-9\">{\u00b6 40} In discussing Section 11, Article XV\u2019s effect on the domestic violence statute and attempting to reconcile the two, the majority first considers the meaning of the term \u201clegal status\u201d as used in the amendment. As the majority points out, the term \u201cstatus\u201d can be defined expansively as \u201c <em>\u2018[a] </em>person\u2019s legal condition, whether personal or proprietary; the sum total of a person\u2019s legal rights, duties, liabilities and other legal relations\u2019,\u201d majority opinion at \u00b6 12, quoting Black\u2019s Law Dictionary (8th Ed.2004) 1447; or it can be defined more narrowly as \u201c \u2018[t]he standing of a person before the law,\u2019 \u201d majority opinion at \u00b6 12, quoting Random House Dictionary of the English Language (2d Ed.1987) 1862. The majority appears to accept the former definition. It states that \u201cbeing married is a status * * * [because it] gives a person certain legal rights, duties, and liabilities,\u201d and then concludes that the second sentence of Section 11, Article XV, means that \u201cthe state cannot create or recognize a legal status for unmarried persons <em>that bears all of the attributes of marriage </em>\u2014 a marriage substitute.\u201d (Emphasis added.) Majority opinion at \u00b6 13.</p>\n<p id=\"b339-10\">{\u00b6 41} Nevertheless, this is not what the disputed sentence says. The legal status prohibited is a legal status \u201cthat intends to approximate\u201d <em>any one </em>of four attributes \u2014 \u201cthe design, qualities, significance <em>or </em>effect\u201d of marriage. (Emphasis added.) The series is disjunctive, not conjunctive.</p>\n<p id=\"b339-11\">{\u00b6 42} Presumably, under the majority\u2019s reasoning, being unmarried does not give one a legal status. Yet unmarried persons living as spouses are covered by <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"218\">*218</page-number>the domestic violence statute; they do attain a legal status, albeit a limited one, for each has standing under law to prosecute the other person for an act of domestic violence. If individuals are unmarried and are roommates, for example, they do not have this statutory status. R.C. 2919.25(A) states that \u201c[n]o person shall knowingly cause or attempt to cause physical harm to a family or household member,\u201d and \u201cfamily or household member\u201d includes \u201c[a] spouse, a person living as- a spouse, or a former spouse of the offender.\u201d R.C. 2919.25(F)(l)(i). \u201cPerson living as a spouse\u201d is defined in R.C. 2919.25(F)(2) as \u201ca person who is living or has lived with the offender in a common law marital relationship, who otherwise is cohabiting with the offender, or who otherwise has cohabited with the offender within five years prior to the date of the alleged commission of the act in question.\u201d</p>\n<p id=\"b340-5\">{\u00b6 43} As noted in Judge Karpinski\u2019s dissenting opinion in State <em>v. Douglas, </em>Cuyahoga App. Nos. 86567 and 86568, 2006-Ohio-2343, 2006 WL 1304860, \u00b6 23, \u201c[w]hen two unmarried people share financial responsibilities and engage in consortium with one another, what else have we done historically as a society other than to recognize that relationship as one that possesses the \u2018design, qualities, significance or effect of marriage.\u2019 \u201d</p>\n<p id=\"b340-6\">{\u00b6 44} Including \u201cperson living as a spouse\u201d within the definition of \u201cfamily or household member\u201d classifies persons who fall into that category as potential domestic violence victims, allowing them additional rights beyond those that would accrue if they were assault victims only. The domestic violence statute is linked to R.C. 2935.03(B)(1) (providing for immediate arrest of the accused) and R.C. 3113.31 (allowing a stronger protection order for the victim). The crime of domestic violence occurs within an intimate relationship and is distinct from the crime of assault.</p>\n<p id=\"b340-7\">{\u00b6 45} An assault, a first-degree misdemeanor, is committed when a person \u201cknowingly cause[s] or attempts] to cause physical harm to another.\u201d R.C. 2903.13(A). An initial domestic violence offense is a first-degree misdemeanor but is elevated to a felony on a second offense, R.C. 2919.25(D)(3); an assault does not become a felony when the offender has a prior assault conviction.</p>\n<p id=\"b340-8\">{\u00b6 46} I believe that the General Assembly\u2019s classification of a \u201cperson living as a spouse\u201d within the definition of \u201cfamily or household member\u201d recognizes a legal status for purposes of the domestic violence statute.</p>\n<p id=\"b340-9\">Intent in Creating Legal Status for \u201cPerson Living as a Spouse\u201d</p>\n<p id=\"b340-10\">{\u00b6 47} A classification that recognizes a legal status for an unmarried relationship does not in and of itself make the statute unconstitutional. The statute as applied to Carswell is unconstitutional only if the \u201clegal status\u201d of a domestic <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"219\">*219</page-number>violence victim who is \u201cliving as a spouse\u201d intends \u201cto approximate the design, qualities, significance or effect of marriage.\u201d</p>\n<p id=\"b341-5\">{\u00b6 48} Using the term \u201cliving as a spouse\u201d within the definition of \u201cfamily or household member\u201d clearly expresses an intent to give an unmarried relationship a legal status that approximates the \u201ceffect of marriage.\u201d The constitutional problem in this case does not arise because cohabitating unmarried persons are included as one of the several groups to whom the domestic violence statutes apply. Instead, the problem is definitional: by using the term \u201cliving as a spouse\u201d to identify persons whom the statutes protect and against whom prosecution may be instituted, the General Assembly inherently equates cohabitating unmarried persons with those who are married and extends the domestic violence statutes to persons because their relationship approximates the significance or effect of marriage.</p>\n<p id=\"b341-6\">{\u00b6 49} In this case, the statute is challenged solely as it applies to persons living as spouses. Carswell was indicted for knowingly causing or attempting to cause physical harm to a \u201cperson living as a spouse\u201d with him. Because R.C. 2919.25 is a criminal statute, it must be strictly construed against the state. <em>State v. Jordan </em>(2000), 89 Ohio St.3d 488, 492, 733 N.E.2d 601. Even though I would strike this classification as unconstitutional, as did the trial court, Carswell would still face charges of assault.</p>\n<p id=\"b341-7\">{\u00b6 50} The majority recognizes that the purpose of the statute is to protect persons from acts of domestic violence but reasons that \u201cR.C. 2919.25 does not create any special or additional rights, privileges, or benefits for family or household members.\u201d Majority opinion at \u00b6 33. In saying that \u201c[t]he state played no role in creating Carswell\u2019s relationship with the alleged victim. Cars-well created that relationship,\u201d majority opinion at \u00b6 35, the majority misses the point. The General Assembly\u2019s classification of \u201cperson living as a spouse\u201d is a <em>recognition </em>by law of the relationship of unmarried and cohabiting individuals based solely on the similarity of that relationship to marriage. It is a status that enables a victim of assault the additional protection offered by the domestic violence statutes. Domestic violence is a crime quite different from a general assault, precisely because of the special intimacy of the parties.</p>\n<p id=\"b341-8\">{\u00b6 51} It appears that an unintended consequence of the second sentence of Section 11, Article XV, is that the state cannot include unmarried relationships within a statute\u2019s protection if in so classifying and defining their status it intends to approximate any one of four attributes of marriage (design, qualities, significance, or effect). In an attempt to reach a more palatable result, the majority concludes that \u201c[wjhile the intent of the domestic-violence statute is to protect persons from violence by close family members or residents of the same household, the intent of the marriage amendment was to prevent the creation or <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"220\">*220</page-number>recognition of a legal status <em>that approximates marriage </em>through judicial, legislative, or executive action.\u201d (Emphasis added.) Majority opinion at \u00b6 36. As attractive as this result is, I cannot agree that the constitution and statute do not conflict.</p>\n<attorneys id=\"ACmS\">Thomas G.

The words in the second sentence of the amendment imply a repeal of the domestic violence statute as applied to a \u201cperson living as a spouse.\u201d There are other definitional classes in R.C. 2919.25, including persons related by blood or affinity. The General Assembly is not prevented from expanding the statutes to others, such as \u201call those living together in a domicile,\u201d for example, as long as those additions are not defined in a way that create or recognize a legal status \u201cthat intends to approximate the design, qualities, significance or effect of marriage\u201d for unmarried relationships.</p>\n<p id=\"b342-6\">{\u00b6 53} I reach this conclusion reluctantly and regretfully. Nevertheless, I believe that we must interpret Section 11, Article XV according to its text, not as we speculate it may have been intended. Insofar as R.C. 2919.25 recognizes as a \u201cfamily or household member\u201d a person not married to the offender but \u201cliving as a spouse\u201d with the offender, it is, in my view, unconstitutional beyond a reasonable doubt. See <em>State ex rel. Dickman v. Defenbacher </em>(1955), 164 Ohio St. 142, 57 O.O.134, 128 N.E.2d 59, paragraph one of the syllabus.</p>\n<p id=\"b342-7\">{\u00b6 54} I respectfully dissent and would reverse the court of appeals and reinstate the trial court\u2019s order amending the charge to one of assault.</p>\n<attorneys id=\"Aoy\"><page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"221\">*221</page-number>Gerhardstein, Branch &amp; Laufman and Alphonse A.
