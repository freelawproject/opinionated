The agreement designated Monday, June 29, 1998, through Thursday, July 2, 1998, as the Independence Week shutdown period and Friday, July 3, 1998, as the Independence Day holiday. Under the agreement, to be paid for those days off, GM <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"90\">*90</page-number>employees were required to work the day prior to and immediately following the shutdown period and holiday.</p>\n<p id=\"b212-4\">{\u00b6 3} In June 1998, workers declared a strike at two GM plants in Michigan. These plants produced parts for several GM plants in Ohio. As the strike progressed, workers at the Ohio plants were laid off because they had an insufficient supply of parts to continue working. These workers, some of whom are the appellees, were unable to work the required days to be eligible for the holiday pay because they were laid off.</p>\n<p id=\"b212-5\">{\u00b6 4} As part of the settlement negotiations ending the strike, GM and the UAW entered into a \u201cMemorandum of Understanding\u201d on July 28, 1998. The memorandum stated:</p>\n<p id=\"b212-6\">{\u00b6 5} \u201cEmployees who were on strike or layoff status at General Motors locations due to the labor dispute at the Flint Metal Center and the Delphi E Flint East and who did not receive Independence Week Shutdown and Holiday pay as a result of being on said layoff or strike and were otherwise entitled to these pay provisions as stipulated in the GM-UAW National Agreement, shall receive a one time special payment in the amount they would have been entitled to had they not been on strike or layoff.</p>\n<p id=\"b212-7\">{\u00b6 6} \u201cThe payment will be * * * taxed as a regular wage payment in accordance with * * * the GM-UAW National Agreement.</p>\n<p id=\"b212-8\">{\u00b6 7} \u201c * * *</p>\n<p id=\"b212-9\">{\u00b6 8} \u201cFurther, the parties recognize that the payments may result in employees being ineligible for unemployment compensation already received. Employees impacted by such overpayment of unemployment compensation will be responsible to repay the State that provided the unemployment compensation.\u201d</p>\n<p id=\"b212-10\">{\u00b6 9} Appellees returned to work in August 1998. Subsequently, appellees claimed unemployment compensation for the weeks they were laid off, including the Independence Week shutdown and holiday. GM contended that the appellees had received compensation for that week and that their claim for unemployment compensation for that week should be disallowed. The Ohio Bureau of Employment Services agreed with GM and disallowed unemployment compensation for June 29 through July 3, 1998. The Unemployment Compensation Review Commission denied the appellees\u2019 appeal. Because of statutory venue requirements, the appeals from that decision were filed in several counties. Ultimately, seven different courts of appeals heard argument on this issue. Six of the courts held that the one-time payment made by GM under the memorandum constituted holiday pay and upheld the determination of the commission denying unemploy<page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"91\">*91</page-number>ment compensation for the appellees.<footnotemark>1</footnotemark> The Sixth District Court of Appeals held that \u201cwhile the one-time special payment was remuneration, which could include payment in the form of a bonus, the evidence does not support a finding that the payment was <em>allocated </em>to the holiday week ending July 4, 1998.\u201d (Emphasis sic.) <em>Geretz v. Ohio Dept. of Job &amp; Family Servs., </em>Erie App. No. 05-042, 2006-Ohio-321, 2006 WL 205108, \u00b6 23. We accepted the conflict certified by the Sixth District Court of Appeals. 109 Ohio St.3d 1421, 2006-Ohio-1967, 846 N.E.2d 532.</p>\n<p id=\"b213-5\">B</p>\n<p id=\"b213-6\">{\u00b6 10} The standard of review in unemployment-compensation appeals is well established. \u201c[A] reviewing court may reverse the board\u2019s determination only if it is unlawful, unreasonable, or against the manifest weight of the evidence.\u201d <em>Tzangas, Plakas &amp; Mannos v. Ohio Bur. of Emp. Servs. </em>(1995), 73 Ohio St.3d 694, 697, 653 N.E.2d 1207. <em>Tzangas </em>and the case it cited, <em>Irvine v. State Unemployment Comp. Bd. of Review </em>(1985), 19 Ohio St.3d 15, 19 OBR 12, 482 N.E.2d 587, both involved claimants who had been found to have left employment \u201cwithout just cause\u201d pursuant to R.C. 4141.29(D)(2). But other courts have applied this standard in other areas of unemployment compensation. See <em>Abrams-Rodkey v. Summit Cty. Children Servs., </em>163 Ohio App.3d 1, 2005-Ohio-4359, 836 N.E.2d 1, \u00b6 7 (reviewing court will not reverse the commission\u2019s determinations that a labor dispute did not involve a lockout \u201cso long as they are supported by credible proof\u2019); <em>Tietz v. Ohio Dept. of Job &amp; Family Servs., </em>Trumbull App. No. 2004-T-132, 2005-Ohio-4767, 2005 WL 2210704, \u00b6 13 (same). We reiterate our holding that when reviewing an appeal from the Unemployment Compensation Review Commission, the court may reverse the commission\u2019s determination only if it is unlawful, unreasonable, or against the manifest weight of the evidence.</p>\n<p id=\"b213-7\">C</p>\n<p id=\"b213-8\">{\u00b6 11} The following statutory provisions guide our analysis. \u201cEach eligible individual shall receive benefits as compensation for loss of remuneration due to involuntary total or partial unemployment in the amounts and subject to the conditions stipulated in this chapter.\u201d R.C. 4141.29.</p>\n<p id=\"b214-3\"><page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"92\">*92</page-number>{\u00b6 12} \u201cAn individual is \u2018totally unemployed\u2019 in any week during which the individual performs no services and with respect to such week no remuneration is payable to the individual.\u201d R.C. 4141.01(M).</p>\n<p id=\"b214-4\">{\u00b6 13} \u201c \u2018Remuneration\u2019 means all compensation for personal services * * R.C. 4141.01(H)(1).</p>\n<p id=\"b214-5\">{\u00b6 14} To be entitled to unemployment compensation for the week of June 29 through July 3, 1998, appellees would have been required to prove that they had performed no services and received no compensation for the week. \u201cServices,\u201d however, are not the same as work. Anytime an employee retains his or her seniority and pension rights and is available for work with the employer, that employee provides services. <em>United Steelworkers of Am. AFL-CIO v. Doyle </em>(1958), 168 Ohio St. 324, 7 O.O.2d 41, 154 N.E.2d 623. For purposes of determining appellees\u2019 right to receive unemployment-compensation benefits, appellees performed services for GM by continuing the employer-employee relationship. Id. at 327, 7 O.O.2d 41, 154 N.E.2d 623. If the appellees received remuneration for that week as well, they are not entitled to unemployment compensation.</p>\n<p id=\"b214-6\">{\u00b6 15} The memorandum provided that each GM employee who was on strike or lockout and who would have otherwise been qualified for the Independence Week shutdown and holiday pay \u201cshall receive a one time special payment in the amount they would have been entitled to had they not been on strike or layoff.\u201d If that compensation, described in the memorandum, is allocated to the week of June 29 through July 3, 1998, then the appellees are not entitled to unemployment compensation for that week.</p>\n<p id=\"b214-7\">{\u00b6 16} R.C. 4141.31(A) provides: \u201cBenefits otherwise payable for any week shall be reduced by the amount of remuneration or other payments a claimant receives with respect to such week as follows:</p>\n<p id=\"b214-8\">{\u00b6 17} \u201c * * *</p>\n<p id=\"b214-9\">{\u00b6 18} \u201c(5) Vacation pay or allowance payable under the terms of a labor-management contract or agreement, or other contract of hire, which payments are allocated to designated weeks.\u201d</p>\n<p id=\"b214-10\">{\u00b6 19} The appellees assert that the one-time special payment was part of a strike settlement. They have not identified any evidence in the record to suggest this sort of classification. Rather, the argument urged by GM, that this pay is vacation pay, is more consistent with the evidence. The memorandum states that those employees who were on strike and did not receive holiday pay are entitled to receive a payment equal to the amount they would have received had they not been laid off. The memorandum allocates the pay to the Independence Holiday <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"93\">*93</page-number>shutdown week, making the allocation vacation pay and precluding the appellees\u2019 receiving unemployment compensation for that week.</p>\n<attorneys id=\"Ava\">Cloppert, Latanick, Sauter <em>&amp; </em>Washburn, Frederick G.
