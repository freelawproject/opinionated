Respondent filed an answer to the complaint, and a panel of the Board of Commissioners on Grievances and Discipline held a hearing on the complaint in September 2006. The panel then prepared written findings of fact, conclusions of law, and a recommended sanction, all of which the board adopted.</p>\n<p id=\"b123-13\">Misconduct</p>\n<p id=\"A6\">\n<em>Count I</em>\n</p>\n<p id=\"b123-14\">{\u00b6 3} In early June 2004, Dawn Schmitz retained respondent to help her obtain custody of her children. Schmitz paid respondent a $2,000 retainer, which respondent deposited into his client trust account. Respondent told Schmitz that he would prepare the necessary paperwork for her right away.</p>\n<p id=\"b123-15\">{\u00b6 4} In late June 2004, Schmitz asked respondent about the status of her case. Respondent told her that his office had been burglarized and that he would prepare the necessary documents for her no later than the next week. When Schmitz did not receive the expected documents, she called respondent\u2019s office and left several messages, but respondent never returned the calls.</p>\n<p id=\"b123-16\">{\u00b6 5} On July 1, 2004, Schmitz sent respondent an e-mail inquiring about her case. Respondent promised to send some documents to her the following afternoon. Respondent finally e-mailed some documents to Schmitz on July 28, <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"2\">*2</page-number>2004. Schmitz completed the documents and faxed them back to respondent the following day.</p>\n<p id=\"b124-5\">{\u00b6 6} During August 2004, Schmitz left numerous telephone messages for respondent, but he never returned the calls. On September 17, 2004, respondent\u2019s secretary e-mailed some documents to Schmitz, who completed them and returned them to respondent. Respondent never filed the forms.</p>\n<p id=\"b124-6\">{\u00b6 7} On September 26, 2004, Schmitz drove from Illinois to respondent\u2019s office in Cincinnati to confront him about his poor performance and lack of communication. Respondent told Schmitz that everything was progressing and that he would send all the documents within a week. Respondent never sent the documents and stopped communicating with Schmitz.</p>\n<p id=\"b124-7\">{\u00b6 8} On November 11, 2004, Schmitz sent respondent an e-mail terminating his services and requesting a refund, but respondent did not reply. Respondent never earned the $2,000 fee, but he had a negative balance in his client trust account as of January 31, 2005. On March 16, 2005, respondent testified falsely under oath that he had refunded Schmitz\u2019s $2,000 retainer and that he had a copy of the refund check. One year later, respondent sent Schmitz a check for $2,000.</p>\n<p id=\"b124-8\">(\u00b6 9} The board found that respondent\u2019s actions violated the following Disciplinary Rules: DR 1 \u2014 102(A)(4) (prohibiting conduct involving dishonesty, fraud, deceit, or misrepresentation), 1-102(A)(6) (barring conduct that adversely reflects on a lawyer\u2019s fitness to practice law), 2-106(A) (prohibiting a lawyer from agreeing to charge or collecting an illegal or clearly excessive fee), 2-110(A)(3) (requiring a lawyer to promptly return unearned fees upon withdrawal from employment), 6-101(A)(3) (prohibiting a lawyer from neglecting an entrusted legal matter), 9-102(B)(4) (requiring a lawyer to promptly repay funds that the client is entitled to receive), and 9-102(E)(l) (requiring a lawyer to maintain client funds in an interest-bearing trust account).</p>\n<p id=\"b124-9\">\n<em>Count II</em>\n</p>\n<p id=\"b124-10\">{\u00b6 10} On September 19, 2003, Tressa Patton met with respondent to discuss the possibility of filing for divorce. That same day, Patton paid respondent $200 toward a $750 retainer. In April 2004, Patton paid respondent the remaining $550 and authorized respondent to file the divorce.</p>\n<p id=\"b124-11\">{\u00b6 11} Between May 2004 and April 2005, Patton left numerous messages for respondent inquiring about the status of her case, but respondent rarely returned the calls. In an April 7, 2005 e-mail, Patton terminated the representation and requested a refund of the full $750 retainer. Respondent replied by e-mail and falsely stated that he had sent Patton a refund check.</p>\n<p id=\"b124-12\">{\u00b6 12} After she failed to receive the promised refund, Patton again inquired about it. Respondent falsely replied, \u201cI will check to see when the <em>second </em>check <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"3\">*3</page-number>went out.\u201d When Patton inquired as to why a second check was sent, respondent replied by e-mail with the false statement, \u201cThe first check was sent to the wrong address so I cancelled the check and sent out a second.\u201d</p>\n<p id=\"b125-5\">{\u00b6 13} From late April 2005 through May 2005, Patton tried repeatedly to contact respondent by phone and e-mail, but he never replied. On March 14, 2006, respondent sent Patton a check for $750.</p>\n<p id=\"b125-6\">{\u00b6 14} The board found that respondent\u2019s actions violated DR 1-102(A)(4), 1-102(A)(6), 2-106(A), 2-110(A)(3), 6-101(A)(3), and 9-102(B)(4).</p>\n<p id=\"b125-7\">\n<em>Count III</em>\n</p>\n<p id=\"b125-8\">{\u00b6 15} In July 2004, Rachelle Napier retained respondent to represent her in an uncontested divorce. Napier paid respondent $100 toward a $506 retainer in January 2005, and then she paid the balance in March 2005.</p>\n<p id=\"b125-9\">{\u00b6 16} Respondent instructed Napier and her husband to attend a parenting class, which they completed in April 2005. Respondent then told Napier that a final divorce hearing would be scheduled in 30 to 60 days. After two months had passed, Napier tried to contact respondent but was unsuccessful.</p>\n<p id=\"b125-10\">{\u00b6 17} On July 1, 2005, Napier called Butler County Family Services, only to learn that the divorce paperwork had never been filed. On that same day, Napier called respondent, who falsely asserted that he had in fact filed the paperwork. Respondent scheduled an appointment with Napier for July 5, 2005. That morning, respondent called Napier and told her that there was no need for the appointment.</p>\n<p id=\"b125-11\">{\u00b6 18} On July 8, 2005, Napier again called Butler County Family Services and learned that respondent still had not filed a divorce complaint for her in Butler County. Napier then called respondent and told him that she no longer wanted his services, and she requested a refund of the retainer. On July 13, 2005, Napier sent a letter to respondent formally terminating the representation and requesting the refund. She also filed a grievance with relator. After respondent received a copy of the grievance, he contacted Napier and promised to file the divorce paperwork for her and to refund the retainer. Respondent did file the paperwork, but failed to return the retainer until eight months later.</p>\n<p id=\"b125-12\">{\u00b6 19} The board found that respondent\u2019s actions violated DR 1-102(A)(4), 1-102(A)(6), 2-110(A)(3), 6-101(A)(3), and 9-102(B)(4).</p>\n<p id=\"b125-13\">\n<em>Count IV</em>\n</p>\n<p id=\"b125-14\">{\u00b6 20} On November 12, 2004, Dennis Quinlan retained respondent to represent him in a divorce. Quinlan paid respondent a $1,000 retainer and agreed to <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"4\">*4</page-number>pay an additional $1,000 the following month. Time was of the essence because Quinlan\u2019s wife had left with the couple\u2019s only child.</p>\n<p id=\"b126-5\">{\u00b6 21} On November 18, 2004, respondent filed paperwork on Quinlan\u2019s behalf with the Warren County Domestic Relations Court, but errors in the paperwork prevented the court from accepting it. By letter dated November 23, 2004, a clerk at the Warren County Domestic Relations Court informed respondent of the problems with the paperwork, but respondent failed to reply.</p>\n<p id=\"b126-6\">{\u00b6 22} When Quinlan was unable to contact respondent, he called the Warren County Domestic Relations Court to check the status of his divorce case. A judge\u2019s secretary told Quinlan that there was a problem with the paperwork and that respondent was aware of the problem. Quinlan then tried to call respondent about the problem but was unable to reach him. On November 24, Quinlan sent respondent a letter about the problem with the paperwork.</p>\n<p id=\"b126-7\">{\u00b6 23} Sometime after that date, respondent asked Quinlan to come to respondent\u2019s office to sign corrected paperwork, and Quinlan did so. Respondent promised to file the paperwork the next day, but he never did.</p>\n<p id=\"b126-8\">{\u00b6 24} On December 8, Quinlan\u2019s wife filed for divorce. On December 13, after consulting with another attorney, Quinlan sent respondent a certified letter terminating respondent\u2019s services and requesting a refund of the unused portion of the retainer. Two days later, Quinlan went to respondent\u2019s office to request the refund.</p>\n<p id=\"b126-9\">{\u00b6 25} Respondent told Quinlan that he needed one or two weeks to tally up Quinlan\u2019s bill and to issue any refund owed. Respondent failed to provide a prompt refund or an itemized bill to Quinlan, and it was not until 15 months later \u2014 on March 14, 2006 \u2014 that respondent sent Quinlan a check for $1,000.</p>\n<p id=\"b126-10\">(\u00b6 26} The board found that respondent\u2019s actions violated DR 1 \u2014 102(A)(5) (prohibiting conduct that is prejudicial to the administration of justice), 1-102(A)(6), 2-110(A)(3), 6-101(A)(3), 9-102(B)(3) (requiring a lawyer to maintain complete records of all funds of a client and to render appropriate accounts), and 9-102(B)(4).</p>\n<p id=\"b126-11\">\n<em>Count V</em>\n</p>\n<p id=\"b126-12\">(\u00b6 27} In January 2004, Terri Kemper retained respondent to represent her in a marriage dissolution. Respondent told Kemper that he would charge her a $600 flat fee, plus $250 for filing fees and $300 for an independent firm to complete her Qualified Domestic Relations Order (\u201cQDRO\u201d). Kemper made a $500 downpayment and agreed to pay an additional $100 within 60 days.</p>\n<p id=\"b126-13\">{\u00b6 28} Relator alleges that Kemper informed respondent that she was eligible to receive benefits under her husband\u2019s retirement plan beginning May 1, 2004. <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"5\">*5</page-number>Although respondent does not contest the allegation, he has no specific recollection on the issue. He believes that he would have informed Kemper that she was eligible to receive benefits either when her husband was eligible to retire or when he actually did retire.</p>\n<p id=\"b127-5\">{\u00b6 29} Respondent told Kemper that if she could obtain the necessary paperwork, he could prepare and file her separation agreement within one week. Within two weeks, Kemper provided respondent all of the documents that he requested.</p>\n<p id=\"b127-6\">{\u00b6 30} Over the next six months, Kemper repeatedly called respondent\u2019s office to check on the status of her case. Respondent rarely returned the calls, and his secretary offered various excuses for the delay.</p>\n<p id=\"b127-7\">{\u00b6 31} At some point during that six-month period, Kemper scheduled an appointment with respondent. When Kemper arrived at the office, the doors were locked, and no one was there. Kemper waited for an hour, but respondent never arrived for the appointment.</p>\n<p id=\"b127-8\">{\u00b6 32} When Kemper was finally able to meet with respondent, she expressed her concerns about the delays in her case. Kemper asked respondent to verify that her husband\u2019s union had accurately represented the amount of income that she could expect to receive each month from her husband\u2019s retirement plan because she was relying on that figure to obtain a mortgage. Respondent reviewed the union\u2019s letter and confirmed to Kemper that she would receive $1,205.72 each month.</p>\n<p id=\"b127-9\">{\u00b6 33} After several weeks, respondent\u2019s secretary told Kemper that her separation agreement had been filed and that a court date had been set for September 1, 2004. Kemper and her husband appeared for the hearing, but respondent failed to attend. When Kemper returned home, she found a message that respondent had left on her answering machine 30 minutes before the hearing, saying that he could not attend the hearing that day. Respondent promised to reimburse Kemper $160 for her lost time, but he never did so.</p>\n<p id=\"b127-10\">{\u00b6 34} Approximately two weeks later, respondent did attend a rescheduled court hearing in Kemper\u2019s case. After the hearing, respondent told Kemper that she would receive a dissolution decree within two weeks. After waiting two weeks, Kemper again started calling respondent to check on the status of the dissolution, but respondent did not reply.</p>\n<p id=\"b127-11\">{\u00b6 35} Kemper evidently contacted her husband\u2019s employer and learned that respondent had never submitted a QDRO. Kemper called respondent and expressed concern that he had not hired an independent firm to complete the QDRO. Respondent falsely stated to Kemper that he was under the impression <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"6\">*6</page-number>that Kemper was going to complete the QDRO on her own. Respondent then completed the QDRO and submitted it to the court.</p>\n<p id=\"b128-5\">{\u00b6 36} In December 2004, Kemper began receiving her distribution from her husband\u2019s retirement plan in the amount of $1,205.72 per month. Two months later, Kemper received a call from her husband\u2019s union stating that the QDRO was incorrectly worded and that she was entitled to only $500 per month. The union also told Kemper that the payments would be halted until the matter was rectified.</p>\n<p id=\"b128-6\">{\u00b6 37} Kemper immediately called respondent, who said that he would correct the language within 10 days. After 10 days, Kemper began calling and e-mailing respondent, but he rarely replied. When respondent spoke with Kemper, he assured her that he would hire QDRO Consultants, Inc. to prepare the new QDRO within one week, and respondent said that he would pay that company\u2019s fee out of his own pocket. Several weeks passed with no word from respondent.</p>\n<p id=\"b128-7\">{\u00b6 38} In April 2005, Kemper called QDRO Consultants, Inc. and learned that the new QDRO had been completed but that the company was still waiting to be paid by respondent. When Kemper called respondent with this news, he falsely told her that he had sent a check to the company three weeks earlier. Kemper confirmed that QDRO Consultants, Inc. had never received a check from respondent and then made arrangements to pay for the new QDRO herself. Before Kemper sent the $400 check to the company, she learned that respondent had finally made the necessary payment. Because of respondent\u2019s conduct, Kemper suffered financially.</p>\n<p id=\"b128-8\">{\u00b6 39} The board found that respondent\u2019s actions violated DR 1-102(A)(4), 1-102(A)(6), and 6-101(A)(3).</p>\n<p id=\"b128-9\">\n<em>Count VI</em>\n</p>\n<p id=\"b128-10\">{\u00b6 40} On September 24, 2004, Heather Lamb-Cromwell retained respondent to represent her in a divorce. Lamb-Cromwell paid respondent a $1,700 retainer, and respondent agreed to charge her $150 per hour. Respondent told Lamb-Cromwell that if she could deliver all of the necessary documentation to him, he could file a complaint for divorce within one week.</p>\n<p id=\"b128-11\">{\u00b6 41} In eai-ly October 2004, Lamb-Cromwell learned that her case had not been filed. She also learned that respondent had submitted a complaint for divorce, but the court had rejected it because it did not conform to the local rules. Lamb-Cromwell tried to contact respondent to tell him about the problem, but she was only able to leave messages with his secretary. On October 19, 2004, respondent filed a revised complaint.</p>\n<p id=\"b128-12\">{\u00b6 42} By November 1, 2004, respondent had a $236.92 balance in his client trust account. One month later, the account balance had fallen to $27.74. <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"7\">*7</page-number>{\u00b6 43} At a January 2005 pretrial conference, respondent appeared unprepared, and the court rescheduled the conference for March 8, 2005. On January 5, 2005, respondent failed to keep an appointment with Lamb-Cromwell. When respondent did meet with Lamb-Cromwell five days later, he advised her to remain in the marital home.</p>\n<p id=\"b129-5\">{\u00b6 44} The following month, Lamb-Cromwell told respondent that her husband was acting inappropriately and that she could no longer tolerate living in the marital home. Nonetheless, respondent instructed Lamb-Cromwell to remain in the home. At a pretrial conference in March 2005, the judge refused to award temporary child support to Lamb-Cromwell because she was still residing in the marital home.</p>\n<p id=\"b129-6\">{\u00b6 45} The following day, Lamb-Cromwell fired respondent and asked for an itemized bill, as well as the return of her file and a refund of the unused retainer. She made multiple trips to respondent\u2019s office, but the materials were never there. In April 2005, respondent\u2019s secretary met Lamb-Cromwell off Interstate 71 and gave her the case file.</p>\n<p id=\"b129-7\">{\u00b6 46} In June 2005, Lamb-Cromwell advised respondent that if she did not receive an itemized bill and the unused portion of the retainer, she would file a grievance against him. Respondent then agreed to give her a full refund, and he sent her a personal money order in the amount of $500. Respondent never provided Lamb-Cromwell an itemized bill.</p>\n<p id=\"b129-8\">{\u00b6 47} The board found that respondent\u2019s actions violated DR 1-102(A)(6), 2-106(A), 2-110(A)(3), 6-101(A)(3), 9-102(B)(3), 9-102(B)(4), and 9-102(E)(l).</p>\n<p id=\"b129-9\">\n<em>Count VII</em>\n</p>\n<p id=\"b129-10\">{\u00b6 48} On December 10, 2005, Michelle Pryor retained respondent to assist her in obtaining a dissolution of her marriage. Pryor paid respondent $500 in legal fees, as well as $250 for filing fees. Pryor provided respondent all of the paperwork necessary to file a separation agreement for her, but respondent failed to file the papers. Pryor left many voicemail messages for respondent, but he rarely returned her calls. Eventually, respondent\u2019s office telephone was disconnected, and his office appeared to be vacant when Pryor stopped there. Respondent never filed for dissolution on Pryor\u2019s behalf, but Pryor did reimburse Pryor in full on March 14, 2006.</p>\n<p id=\"b129-11\">{\u00b6 49} The board found that respondent\u2019s actions violated DR 1-102(A)(6) and 6-101(A)(3).</p>\n<p id=\"b129-12\">\n<em>Count VIII</em>\n</p>\n<p id=\"b129-13\">{\u00b6 50} Rachel Schlosser purchased a standardized \u201cDissolution with Children Forms\u201d kit from respondent\u2019s website. Schlosser paid respondent $140 for the <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"8\">*8</page-number>forms kit and $250 in filing fees. Respondent reviewed the forms based on the information Schlosser provided, but he never filed for a dissolution on her behalf.</p>\n<p id=\"b130-4\">{\u00b6 51} Schlosser tried to contact respondent several times, but respondent rarely returned the calls. When he did, he made excuses for the delay. After several more weeks, respondent contacted Schlosser and told her that she had not filled out the paperwork properly. Schlosser asked respondent to return the paperwork and the filing fee to her. Respondent said that he would do so, but he never returned the paperwork. On March 17, 2006, respondent did refund $250 to Schlosser.</p>\n<p id=\"b130-5\">{\u00b6 52} The board found that respondent\u2019s actions violated DR 1-102(A)(6) and 6-101(A)(3).</p>\n<p id=\"b130-6\">\n<em>Count IX</em>\n</p>\n<p id=\"b130-7\">{\u00b6 53} On December 2, 2005, this court suspended respondent\u2019s license to practice law because he had failed to comply with the biennial attorney-registration requirement in Gov.Bar R. VI. See <em>In re Friedman, </em>107 Ohio St.3d 1431, 2005-Ohio-6408, 838 N.E.2d 671. On February 24, 2006, we reinstated respondent\u2019s license to practice law after he had complied with the attorney-registration requirement. See <em>In re Miscellaneous Order, </em>108 Ohio St.3d 1491, 2006-Ohio-1050, 843 N.E.2d 796. Between December 2, 2005, and February 24, 2006, respondent practiced law while his license was under suspension.</p>\n<p id=\"b130-8\">{\u00b6 54} The board found that respondent\u2019s actions violated DR 3 \u2014 101(B) (prohibiting a lawyer from practicing law in violation of the professional regulations of a jurisdiction) and Gov.Bar R. VI(6)(C) (prohibiting an attorney from practicing law in Ohio when the attorney has been summarily suspended for failing to register with the Attorney Registration Section).</p>\n<p id=\"b130-9\">Sanction</p>\n<p id=\"b130-10\">{\u00b6 55} Relator and respondent jointly recommended a two-year suspension from the practice of law, with the final six months of the suspension stayed on condition that respondent comply with a contract with the Ohio Lawyers Assistance Program (\u201cOLAP\u201d). The panel and the board adopted that recommendation, but with additional conditions. Respondent has filed no objections to the board\u2019s findings or its recommendation.</p>\n<p id=\"b130-11\">{\u00b6 56} We have reviewed the board\u2019s report and the record, and we find that respondent violated all of the provisions as described above. We also adopt the board\u2019s recommended sanction.</p>\n<p id=\"b130-12\">{\u00b6 57} In imposing a sanction for attorney misconduct, we consider the aggravating and mitigating factors listed in Section 10 of the Rules and Regulations Governing Procedure on Complaints and Hearings Before the Board of <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"9\">*9</page-number>Commissioners on Grievances and Discipline (\u201cBCGD Proc.Reg.\u201d). The aggravating factors in this case include the pattern of misconduct and respondent\u2019s multiple offenses. BCGD Proc.Reg. 10(B)(1)(c) and (d).</p>\n<p id=\"b131-5\">{\u00b6 58} Mitigating factors identified by the board in this case include the absence of any prior disciplinary record, respondent\u2019s full and free disclosure to the board and his cooperative attitude toward the disciplinary proceedings, his good character and reputation, and other interim rehabilitation. BCGD Proc. Reg. 10(B)(2)(a), (d), (e), and (h).</p>\n<p id=\"b131-6\">{\u00b6 59} The board also found that respondent had suffered from a diagnosed chemical dependency to drugs and alcohol that had contributed to his misconduct, and the board also found that he had successfully completed an approved treatment program. BCGD Proc.Reg. 10(B)(2)(g). Patrick Garry, an associate director of OLAP, testified at the disciplinary hearing that respondent had been treated for drug and alcohol addictions after respondent acknowledged in October 2005 that he was an alcoholic and a drug addict. Garry stated at the disciplinary hearing in September 2006 that respondent could return to the practice of law \u201c[i]f he does the things he\u2019s doing now and has been doing for the last 11 months.\u201d</p>\n<p id=\"b131-7\">{\u00b6 60} After weighing the aggravating and mitigating factors in this case, we agree with the parties and the board that respondent should be suspended from the practice of law for two years, with the final six months of that suspension stayed on conditions. Respondent\u2019s arrest in October 2005 for possession of cocaine appears to have marked a turning point in his life and his career, and the treatment regimen that he started soon thereafter for his cocaine and alcohol addictions is a good beginning. Respondent testified at the disciplinary hearing that he has been sober since October 2005, and he stated that he attends daily meetings with a network of people to whom he can turn for help and support. Respondent also expressed \u201ctremendous regret\u201d for his misconduct, and he pledged to pay full restitution to his clients, including the repayment of all of the retainer paid by Heather Lamb-Cromwell and compensation to Terri Kemper for the wages that she lost when she came to court for a hearing that respondent failed to attend.</p>\n<p id=\"b131-8\">{\u00b6 61} A two-year suspension with the final six months stayed will appropriately protect the public, provided that respondent continues his daily efforts at maintaining sobriety.</p>\n<p id=\"b131-9\">{\u00b6 62} We have imposed a similar sanction in other cases. See, e.g., <em>Muskingum Cty. Certified Grievance Commt. v.
