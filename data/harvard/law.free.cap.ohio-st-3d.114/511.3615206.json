Because Sup.R. 12(A) requires judges to permit the taking of photographs in court proceedings that are open to the public as provided by law, and the juvenile court did not hear evidence and argument and make the requisite findings in accordance with the applicable law before preventing photographs of the alleged juvenile delinquent\u2019s face, we grant the writ.</p>\n<p id=\"b633-16\">{\u00b6 2} Relator, the Dispatch Printing Company (\u201cDispatch\u201d), publishes the Columbus Dispatch, a daily central Ohio newspaper. In September 2006, the Dispatch learned of the arrests of three juveniles charged with delinquency counts of aggravated murder and aggravated robbery related to the death of <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"512\">*512</page-number>Terry Ward. The Franklin County Court of Common Pleas, Juvenile Division, scheduled a plea hearing for one of the juveniles, Elijah Nichols, who was 15 years old at that time, for the morning of February 16, 2007.</p>\n<p id=\"b634-4\">{\u00b6 3} On February 15, upon learning of the plea hearing and in accordance with Sup.R. 12(A) and Loc.R. 9(1) of the Franklin County Court of Common Pleas, Juvenile Division, the Dispatch filed a written request with respondent, Judge Christopher J. Geer of the juvenile court, to photograph the proceedings in the case.</p>\n<p id=\"b634-5\">{\u00b6 4} On February 16, at the beginning of the plea hearing, the judge asked whether anyone objected to the Dispatch\u2019s presence at the hearing. The parents of the alleged juvenile delinquent objected to any photographs of the juvenile. In response to the Dispatch\u2019s request and the parents\u2019 objection, the judge issued an order allowing the Dispatch to photograph the proceedings, but forbidding any photographs of the juvenile\u2019s face. He determined that approval of the Dispatch\u2019s request \u2014 with the caveat preventing pictures of the juvenile\u2019s face \u2014 \u2022 \u201cwould not distract participants, impair the dignity of the proceedings or otherwise materially interfere with the achievement of a fair trial or hearing herein.\u201d</p>\n<p id=\"b634-6\">{\u00b6 5} Judge Geer held no evidentiary hearing and made no findings based on evidence to support his decision preventing the Dispatch from photographing the juvenile\u2019s face. There was also no prior notice that the judge intended to consider any restriction on photographing the proceedings.</p>\n<p id=\"b634-7\">{\u00b6 6} The Dispatch objected to the ruling and requested time to notify its counsel to participate in any closure hearing. The judge denied the Dispatch\u2019s objection and request and proceeded to conduct the plea hearing while forbidding any photographs of the juvenile\u2019s face.</p>\n<p id=\"b634-8\">{\u00b6 7} Later on that same day, February 16, the Dispatch filed this action for a writ of prohibition to prevent Judge Geer from enforcing his February 16 order barring the Dispatch from taking photographs of the juvenile\u2019s face in the delinquency proceeding and to prevent the judge from closing further judicial proceedings unless and until notice, hearing, and finding requirements have been met. On February 21, we granted an alternative writ and issued an expedited schedule for the presentation of evidence and briefs. <em>State ex rel. Dispatch Printing Co. v. Geer, </em>112 Ohio St.3d 1480, 2007-Ohio-704, 861 N.E.2d 819. The Dispatch submitted evidence, and the parties filed briefs.</p>\n<p id=\"b634-9\">{\u00b6 8} This cause is now before the court for our consideration of the Dispatch\u2019s prohibition claim.</p>\n<p id=\"b634-10\">Mootness</p>\n<p id=\"b634-11\">(\u00b6 9} Judge Geer contends that this case is moot because the February 16 plea hearing in the underlying case has now concluded and \u201cthere is no longer an order to be enforced.\u201d</p>\n<p id=\"b635-5\"><page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"513\">*513</page-number>{\u00b6 10} A claim is not moot if it is capable of repetition, yet evading review. <em>State ex rel. Law Office of Montgomery Cty. Pub. Defender v. Rosencrans, </em>111 Ohio St.3d 338, 2006-Ohio-5793, 856 N.E.2d 250, \u00b6 16. \u201cThis exception applies only in exceptional circumstances in which the following two factors are both present: (1) the challenged action is too short in its duration to be fully litigated before its cessation or expiration, and (2) there is a reasonable expectation that the same complaining party will be subject to the same action again.\u201d <em>State ex rel. Calvary v. Upper Arlington </em>(2000), 89 Ohio St.3d 229, 231, 729 N.E.2d 1182.</p>\n<p id=\"b635-6\">{\u00b6 11} Like more typical orders, the February 16 order barring the Dispatch from taking photographs of the juvenile\u2019s face during the plea hearing in the delinquency proceeding was too brief in its duration to be fully litigated before the plea hearing concluded. See <em>State ex rel. Beacon Journal Publishing Co. v. Donaldson </em>(1992), 63 Ohio St.3d 173,175, 586 N.E.2d 101.</p>\n<p id=\"b635-7\">{\u00b6 12} In addition, there is a reasonable expectation that the judge will subject the Dispatch to comparable orders in the future. Judge Geer states his continued belief that \u201ca closure hearing is not necessary when merely restricting the photographing of a witness\u201d and maintains that his order \u201cwas specifically authorized\u201d by Sup.R. 12.</p>\n<p id=\"b635-8\">{\u00b6 13} Therefore, the Dispatch\u2019s prohibition claim is not moot, because it is capable of repetition, yet evading review. Thus, we now proceed to address the merits of the Dispatch\u2019s claim.</p>\n<p id=\"b635-9\">Prohibition</p>\n<p id=\"b635-10\">{\u00b6 14} We have determined the propriety of access restrictions in the context of extraordinary-writ actions. See, e.g., <em>State ex rel. Natl. Broadcasting Co., Inc. v. Lake Cty. Court of Common Pleas </em>(1990), 52 Ohio St.3d 104, 114, 556 N.E.2d 1120 (granting writ of prohibition to prevent trial court judge from enforcing ban on photographing, filming, or taping of defendant while in courtroom); <em>State ex rel. Grinnell Communications Corp. v. Love </em>(1980), 62 Ohio St.2d 399, 16 O.O.3d 434, 406 N.E.2d 809 (granting writ of mandamus to, inter alia, compel photographic coverage of certain trials). This, however, is not a typical closure case, for there is a distinction between the actual closure of proceedings and the prohibition of certain photographs.</p>\n<p id=\"b635-11\">{\u00b6 15} Currently, no rule requires an evidentiary hearing if the court decides to limit photography inside a courtroom. There is, however, a mandate in Sup.R. 12(A), which states in full: \u201cThe judge assigned to the trial or hearing <em>shall permit </em>the broadcasting or recording by electronic means and the taking of photographs in court proceedings that are open to the public as provided by Ohio law. After consultation with the media, the judge shall specify the place or places in the courtroom where the operators and equipment are to be positioned. <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"514\">*514</page-number>Requests for permission for the broadcasting, televising, recording, or taking of photographs in the courtroom shall be in writing and the written order of the judge shall be made a part of the record of the proceedings.\u201d (Emphasis added.)</p>\n<p id=\"b636-5\">{\u00b6 16} If the media file an appropriate request<footnotemark>1</footnotemark> to broadcast or photograph proceedings, and the request is granted, the media rightfully expect that there will be no restrictions other than those stated by the rule. Sup.R. 12(B) relates to the regulation of operators and their equipment,<footnotemark>2</footnotemark> and Sup.R. 12(C) states certain prohibitions regarding what and who may be recorded, photographed, or broadcast.<footnotemark>3</footnotemark></p>\n<p id=\"b637-5\"><page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"515\">*515</page-number>{\u00b6 17} None of the exceptions to Sup.R. 12 is applicable. For example, Judge Geer claims that his February 16 order was justified because under Sup.R. 12(C)(2), \u201c[t]he judge shall inform victims and witnesses of their right to object to being filmed, videotaped, recorded, or photographed.\u201d Judge Geer claims that the juvenile was \u201cthe only witness to testify at the plea hearing\u201d and that the juvenile objected to being photographed. But the judge failed to introduce any evidence in this case to support his assertion that the juvenile testified as a witness at the plea hearing.</p>\n<p id=\"b637-6\">{\u00b6 18} In this case, relator made an appropriate request for access to a February 16, 2007 plea hearing in juvenile court. Consistent with Sup.R. 12,<footnotemark>4</footnotemark> the media were specifically allowed by court order to \u201cbroadcast, televise, record or photograph\u201d the proceedings; however, the entry also included the handwritten restriction \u201cNo pictures of the child\u2019s face.\u201d This order was entered after the judge received an objection by the juvenile\u2019s parents to the juvenile\u2019s being photographed, without offering media representatives the opportunity to be heard. Moreover, the juvenile\u2019s parents, who were the parties requesting the limitation, did not address any of the usual reasons for restricting the media: that a reasonable and substantial basis existed to believe that photographing their son\u2019s face could harm him or endanger the fairness of the adjudication, that the potential for harm outweighed the benefits of public access, or that there were no reasonable alternatives other than preventing the photographing. See <em>State ex rel. Plain Dealer Publishing Co. v. Geauga Cty. Court of Common Pleas, Juvenile Div. </em>(2000), 90 Ohio St.3d 79, 85, 734 N.E.2d 1214 (a juvenile court may restrict public access to delinquency proceedings if, after hearing evidence and argument on the issue, the court makes these findings).</p>\n<p id=\"b637-7\">{\u00b6 19} Even though the judge\u2019s order did not prevent public access, since it did not totally ban the photographing of the proceedings or ban the photographing of the juvenile entirely, but merely prevented the photographing of the juvenile\u2019s face, it was based upon unsupported findings. At the very least, all parties affected must have the opportunity to respond to the possibility of any restriction, and any finding must be based upon evidence in the record.</p>\n<p id=\"b637-8\">{\u00b6 20} We therefore grant the requested writ of prohibition to prevent Judge Geer from entering a future restriction without allowing all parties affected to have the opportunity to respond to the possibility of a restriction before the order is entered.</p>\n<attorneys id=\"Adq\"><page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"516\">*516</page-number>Zeiger, Tigges <em>&amp; </em>Little, L.L.P., Marion H. Little Jr., and Matthew S. Zeiger, for relator.</attorneys>\n<attorneys id=\"A1Y\">Ron O\u2019Brien, Franklin County Prosecuting Attorney, and Nick A. Soulas Jr., First Assistant Prosecuting Attorney, for respondent.</attorneys>\n<p id=\"b638-3\">{\u00b6 21} In so holding, however, we reject the Dispatch\u2019s additional claim of a <em>constitutional right </em>to photograph the proceedings, because there is no constitutional right of access to juvenile delinquency proceedings. See, e.g., <em>Floyd, </em>111 Ohio St.3d 56, 2006-Ohio-4437, 855 N.E.2d 35, \u00b6 27; see, also, <em>Geauga Cty. Court of Common Pleas, Juvenile Div., </em>90 Ohio St.3d at 82-83, 734 N.E.2d 1214 (\u201ctraditional interests of confidentiality and rehabilitation prevent the public from having a qualified constitutional right of access to juvenile delinquency proceedings\u201d); <em>Conway v. United States </em>(C.A.6, 1988), 852 F.2d 187, and cases cited therein (upholding the constitutionality of federal rule prohibiting telecasting, broadcasting, or photographing of federal criminal proceedings).</p>\n<p id=\"b638-4\">Writ granted.</p>\n<judges id=\"b638-5\">Moyer, C.J., Lundberg Stratton, O\u2019Connor, O\u2019Donnell and Cupp, JJ., concur.</judges>\n<judges id=\"b638-6\">Pfeifer, J., dissents.</judges>\n<footnote label=\"1\">\n<p id=\"b636-6\">.
