Appellee William Webb, Deborah\u2019s husband, was injured in the accident. McCarty had an automobile liability policy that provided coverage subject to a $300,000-per-accident limit.</p>\n<p id=\"b414-11\">{\u00b6 2} Webb settled his individual claims with McCarty for $25,000. The estate of Deborah Webb settled its claims for $269,836.08. The issue before us is whether Webb, his children, or others have a claim to underinsured-motorists (\u201cUM\u201d) coverage under Webb\u2019s insurance policy, which had a $100,000-per-person limit and a $300,000-per-accident limit. We conclude that Webb\u2019s UM policy provides coverage for the difference between the $300,000-per-accident limit and the $269,836.08 that was paid to the estate. Although we are unable to determine from the briefs or oral argument how they reach the number, the parties appear to agree that the amount paid under the policy is $269,836.08.</p>\n<p id=\"b414-12\">{\u00b6 3} Appellant argues that because Webb\u2019s UM policy was for the same amount as McCarty\u2019s liability policy, there is no UM coverage. We have rejected this argument, that a limits-to-limits comparison controls, in situations involving multiple claimants. <em>Littrell v. Wigglesworth </em>(2001), 91 Ohio St.3d 425, 432, 746 N.E.2d 1077; <em>Clark v. Scarpelli </em>(2001), 91 Ohio St.3d 271, 744 N.E.2d 719. Today we reject it again, summarily, on the authority of <em>Littrell.</em></p>\n<p id=\"b414-13\">{\u00b6 4} In <em>Littrell, </em>we stated that \u201c[f]or the purpose of setoff, the \u2018amounts available for payment\u2019 language in R.C. 3937.18(A)(2) means the amounts actually accessible to and recoverable by an underinsured motorist claimant from all bodily injury liability bonds and insurance policies (including from the tortfeasor\u2019s liability carrier). <em>Clark v. Scarpelli </em>(2001), 91 Ohio St.3d 271, 744 N.E.2d 719, followed and applied.\u201d <em>Littrell, </em>91 Ohio St.3d 425, 746 N.E.2d 1077, syllabus. The opinion made it clear that, in a case involving multiple claimants, UM <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"293\">*293</page-number>coverage would be compared to the amount paid under an automobile liability policy, not to the limit of the automobile liability policy. Id. at 428-435, 746 N.E.2d 1077.</p>\n<p id=\"b415-5\">{\u00b6 5} In this case, $269,836.08 was paid under McCarty\u2019s automobile liability policy. This amount is the \u201camountf] available for payment.\u201d Former R.C. 3937.18(A)(2), 148 Ohio Laws, Part V, 11380, 11381. See <em>Littrell, </em>91 Ohio St.3d 425, 746 N.E.2d 1077, syllabus. Accordingly, Webb and other claimants under his policy are underinsured to the extent that his UM policy\u2019s per-accident limit, $300,000, exceeds the amount available for payment. Webb and other claimants are, of course, subject to the policy\u2019s per-person limit of $100,000.</p>\n<p id=\"b415-6\">{\u00b6 6} We affirm the judgment of the court of appeals and remand the cause to the trial court.</p>\n<p id=\"b415-7\">Judgment affirmed and cause remanded.</p>\n<judges id=\"b415-8\">Moyek, C.J., and O\u2019Connor, J., concur.</judges>\n<judges id=\"b415-9\">Lundberg Stratton, Lanzinger and Cupp, JJ., concur in judgment only.</judges>\n<judges id=\"AP0\">O\u2019Donnell, J., dissents.</judges>\n</opinion>\n<opinion data-order=\"6\" data-type=\"opinion\" id=\"x999-2\" type=\"concurrence\">\n<author id=\"b415-10\">Lundberg Stratton, J.,</author>\n<p id=\"Asy\">concurring in judgment only.</p>\n<p id=\"b415-11\">{\u00b6 7} Because of the doctrine of stare decisis, I must concur with the majority. However, I write separately to voice my concern that both <em>Littrell v. Wigglesworth </em>(2001), 91 Ohio St.3d 425, 746 N.E.2d 1077, and <em>Clark v. Scarpelli </em>(2001), 91 Ohio St.3d 271, 744 N.E.2d 719, were wrongly decided and misapplied R.C. 3937.18(A)(2). In those cases, I joined Justice Cook\u2019s well-reasoned dissenting opinions that opposed the majority\u2019s construing of the unambiguous phrase \u201cavailable for payment\u201d to reach an outcome, contrary to the clear statutory language.</p>\n<p id=\"b415-12\">{\u00b6 8} I continue to believe that \u201c[t]he plain language of the statute mandates a limits-to-limits comparison as opposed to a comparison of the amounts actually recovered to the underinsured motorist policy limits.\u201d <em>Littrell v. Wigglesworth, </em>91 Ohio St.3d at 436, 746 N.E.2d 1077 (Cook, J., dissenting). This is supported by the General Assembly\u2019s amendment of R.C. 3937.18 in 1994, 145 Ohio Laws, Part I, 204, expressly superseding, id. at section 7, <em>Savoie v. Grange Mut. Ins. Co. </em>(1993), 67 Ohio St.3d 500, 620 N.E.2d 809, in which a majority of this court \u201cimplicitly construed \u2018the limits of coverage available for payment\u2019 to mean \u2018the amounts which the tortfeasor\u2019s insurer has already paid.\u2019\u201d <em>Clark, </em>91 Ohio St.3d at 286, 744 N.E.2d 719 (Cook, J., dissenting), quoting <em>Savoie, </em>67 Ohio St.3d at 508, 620 N.E.2d 809. As Justice Cook also stated, this position is contrary to the <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"294\">*294</page-number>public policy behind R.C. 3937.18 that uninsured- and underinsured-motorist coverage is not intended as excess insurance. Id. at 288, 744 N.E.2d 719.</p>\n<p id=\"b416-4\">{\u00b6 9} The General Assembly has amended R.C. 3937.18 on several occasions since <em>Savoie </em>in 1993 and once since <em>Clark </em>and <em>Littrell </em>in 2001, but it has not changed the phrase \u201cavailable for payment\u201d and has not expressly overruled <em>Clark </em>or <em>Littrell. </em>Although Nationwide urged us to overrule <em>Clark </em>and <em>Littrell, </em>Nationwide has not shown that the test set forth in <em>Westfield Ins. Co. v. Galatis, </em>100 Ohio St.3d 216, 2003-Ohio-5849, 797 N.E.2d 1256, for abandoning precedent has been met. Consequently, I am bound by the doctrine of stare decisis. Any further change must come from the General Assembly. For these reasons, I concur in judgment only.</p>\n</opinion>\n<opinion data-order=\"7\" data-type=\"opinion\" id=\"x999-3\" type=\"concurrence\">\n<author id=\"b416-5\">Lanzinger, J.,</author>\n<p id=\"AUD\">concurring in judgment only.</p>\n<p id=\"b416-6\">{\u00b6 10} Because the parties did not conduct the appropriate analysis pursuant to <em>Westfield Ins. Co. v. Galatis, </em>100 Ohio St.3d 216, 2003-Ohio-5849, 797 N.E.2d 1256, to overrule <em>Littrell v. Wigglesworth </em>(2001), 91 Ohio St.3d 425, 746 N.E.2d 1077, and <em>Clark v. Scarpelli </em>(2001), 91 Ohio St.3d 271, 744 N.E.2d 719, I concur in judgment only.</p>\n<judges id=\"b416-7\">Cupp, J., concurs in the foregoing opinion.</judges>\n</opinion>\n<opinion data-order=\"8\" data-type=\"opinion\" id=\"x999-4\" type=\"dissent\">\n<author id=\"b416-8\">O\u2019Donnell, J.,</author>\n<p id=\"APk\">dissenting.</p>\n<p id=\"b416-9\">{\u00b6 11} Respectfully, I dissent.</p>\n<p id=\"b416-10\">{\u00b6 12} The plain language of former R.C. 3937.18(A)(2) specifies when underinsured-motorist coverage arises: \u201cwhere the <em>limits </em>of coverage available for payment to the insured under all bodily injury liability bonds and insurance policies covering persons liable to the insured are less than the <em>limits </em>for the insured\u2019s uninsured motorist coverage.\u201d (Emphasis added.) Thus, pursuant to this language; it appears that when the tortfeasor\u2019s liability coverage limits are less than the plaintiffs uninsured-motorist coverage limits, the plaintiff is entitled to underinsured-motorist coverage in accordance with the policy. However, the Ohio Supreme Court has rejected this interpretation in <em>Littrell v. Wigglesworth </em>(2001), 91 Ohio St.3d 425, 746 N.E.2d 1077, and <em>Clark v. Scarpelli </em>(2001), 91 Ohio St.3d 271, 744 N.E.2d 719. Instead, in those decisions, the court held that the phrase \u201cavailable for payment,\u201d as used in R.C. 3937.18(A)(2), does not refer to the tortfeasor\u2019s policy limits but rather refers to the amounts actually recovered from the tortfeasor. Thus, pursuant to <em>Littrell </em>and <em>Clark, </em>a plaintiff is entitled to underinsured-motorist benefits when the amount the plaintiff actually recovers <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"295\">*295</page-number>from the tortfeasor is less than the limits of the plaintiffs uninsured-motorist coverage.</p>\n<attorneys id=\"ArO\">Maguire &amp; Schneider, L.L.P., Wayne E. Hassay, and Sharlene I. Chance, for appellees.</attorneys>\n<attorneys id=\"Aui\">John C. Cahill, for appellant.</attorneys>\n<p id=\"b417-5\">{\u00b6 13} I can find no language in this statute that refers to \u201cthe amounts actually recovered.\u201d My analysis of this statute is, therefore, that it has been wrongly interpreted and applied; that these cases have produced a body of case authority at odds with legislative intent, thereby defying practical workability; and that abandoning our <em>Littrell/Clark </em>precedent would not create an undue hardship for those who have relied upon it.</p>\n<p id=\"b417-6\">{\u00b6 14} Accordingly, I would apply <em>Westfield Ins. Co. v. Galatis, </em>100 Ohio St.3d 216, 2003-Ohio-5849, 797 N.E.2d 1256, overrule <em>Littrell </em>and <em>Clark, </em>give meaning to the plain language of this statute, reverse the judgment of the court of appeals, and adopt the well-reasoned dissent authored by Justice Cook in <em>Littrell.</em></p>\n</opinion>\n</casebody>\n",
