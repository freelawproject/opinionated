We hold that it does.</p>\n<p id=\"b251-11\">Case Background</p>\n<p id=\"b251-12\">{\u00b6 <em>2} </em>Appellant, James Kincaid, was injured in 1984 when he was employed by Allen Refractories Company. Kincaid sustained severe facial trauma and a concussion at work, and a workers\u2019 compensation claim was allowed for \u201cfractured left cheekbone; lacerated left cheek; cerebral concussion; scintillating scintellens (periodic loss of bilateral vision).\u201d Eventually, in May 2004, the commission awarded him scheduled-loss compensation pursuant to 4123.57(B), which authorizes partial disability compensation for \u201c100% bilateral total loss of sight.\u201d It is undisputed that as often as nine times a week, Kincaid suffers intermittent episodes of total vision loss that last up to 45 minutes.</p>\n<p id=\"b251-13\">{\u00b6 3} No appeal was taken from the order granting scheduled-loss compensation.</p>\n<p id=\"b251-14\">{\u00b6 <em>4} A </em>month later, Kincaid applied for additional compensation for permanent total disability under R.C. 4123.58(C). The commission denied that request on July 21, 2004, concluding that the \u201cinjured worker\u2019s impaired vision does not rise to the level that he is qualified for this type of award under Section 4123.58(C). The evidence on file indicates the injured worker has not sustained \u2018a loss of use\u2019 for both eyes.\u201d The commission distinguished the standards for \u201closs\u201d within R.C. 4123.57(B) and 4123.58(C), stating that an award under the former did not compel one under the latter. It reasoned that when Kincaid was <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"130\">*130</page-number>not having an ocular disturbance, he was not blind, having 20/80 vision in the right eye and 20/60 vision in the left. The commission therefore concluded that Kincaid did not have the permanent and total loss of use in both eyes that R.C. 4123.58(C) requires.</p>\n<p id=\"b252-4\">{\u00b6 5} In December 2004, Kincaid filed a complaint in mandamus in the Court of Appeals for Franklin County, requesting that the court order the commission to grant his motion for statutory permanent and total disability benefits. In his brief, Kincaid asserted that the commission abused its discretion in denying permanent total disability because collateral estoppel precluded new conclusions as to whether his loss of vision is total.</p>\n<p id=\"b252-5\">{\u00b6 6} The court of appeals denied the writ. The court deemed collateral estoppel to be inapplicable because the case lacked the identity of issues required for the doctrine\u2019s invocation. This matter is now before us on an appeal as of right.</p>\n<p id=\"b252-6\">Legal Analysis</p>\n<p id=\"b252-7\">{\u00b6 7} Kincaid argues that when he was granted compensation for permanent partial disability on May 10, 2004, and the finding of bilateral total loss of sight became final, the commission was collaterally estopped from later finding that his loss was less than total by denying him permanent total disability compensation.</p>\n<p id=\"b252-8\">{\u00b6 8} A derivative of res judicata, collateral estoppel bars \u201cthe relitigation of a point of law or fact that was at issue in a former action between the same parties and was passed upon by a court of competent jurisdiction.\u201d <em>Office of Consumers\u2019 Counsel v. Pub. Util. Comm. </em>(1985), 16 Ohio St.3d 9, 10, 16 OBR 361, 475 N.E.2d 782. It requires \u201can identity of parties and issues in the proceedings\u201d and applies equally to administrative hearings. <em>Beatrice Foods Co., Inc. v. Lindley </em>(1982), 70 Ohio St.2d 29, 35, 24 O.O.3d 68, 434 N.E.2d 727; See, also, <em>Set Prods., Inc. v. Bainbridge Twp. Bd. of Zoning Appeals </em>(1987), 31 Ohio St.3d 260, 264, 31 OBR 463, 510 N.E.2d 373.</p>\n<p id=\"b252-9\">{\u00b6 9} The court of appeals held that the two awards under discussion differed in their purpose, as permanent partial compensation resembles a damages award, and permanent total disability compensates for impaired earning capacity. <em>State ex rel. Gen. Motors Corp. v. Indus. Comm. </em>(1975), 42 Ohio St.2d 278, 282, 71 O.O.2d 255, 328 N.E.2d 387. Collateral estoppel does not apply, the court reasoned, because there is no identity of issues: a determination under one disability statute does not translate into an equivalent finding for purposes of another. We agree with the general principle; however, the court of appeals and the commission erred in applying the term \u201closs of use\u201d in this case. The medical evidence before the commission does not establish that Kincaid\u2019s vision was corrected subsequent to the finding of \u201c100% bilateral total loss of sight.\u201d</p>\n<p id=\"b253-4\"><page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"131\">*131</page-number>{\u00b6 10} We must look at the pertinent provisions of both statutes. R.C. 4123.57 governs permanent partial disability compensation. Among the benefits available thereunder is scheduled-loss compensation. Section (B) provides:</p>\n<p id=\"b253-5\">{\u00b6 11} \u201cIn cases included in the following schedule the compensation payable per week to the employee is the statewide average weekly wage as defined in division (C) of section 4123.62 of the Revised Code per week and shall continue during the periods provided in the following schedule:</p>\n<p id=\"b253-6\">{\u00b6 12} \u201c * * *</p>\n<p id=\"b253-7\">{\u00b6 13} \u201cFor the permanent partial loss of sight of an eye, the portion of one hundred twenty-five weeks as the administrator in each case determines, based upon the percentage of vision actually lost as a result of the injury or occupational disease, but, in no case shall an award of compensation be made for less than twenty-five per cent of loss of uncorrected vision. \u2018Loss of uncorrected vision\u2019 means the percentage of vision actually lost as the result of the injury or occupational disease.\u201d</p>\n<p id=\"b253-8\">{\u00b6 14} R.C. 4123.58 controls permanent total disability compensation and at section (C) states:</p>\n<p id=\"b253-9\">{\u00b6 15} \u201cThe loss or loss of use of both hands or both arms, or both feet or both legs, or both eyes, or any two thereof, constitutes total and permanent disability, to be compensated according to this section.\u201d</p>\n<p id=\"b253-10\">{\u00b6 16} Both statutes refer to \u201closs\u201d or \u201closs of use.\u201d Since removal of the eyes was not suffered in this case, we look to \u201closs of use.\u201d Implicit in \u201closs\u201d for purposes of both statutes is that the loss is permanent. Also implicit in 4123.58(C) is that the loss is total. In May 2004, in adjudicating Kincaid\u2019s request for scheduled-loss benefits under R.C. 4123.57(B), the commission found that Kincaid had \u201c100% bilateral total loss of sight.\u201d</p>\n<p id=\"b253-11\">{\u00b6 17} We have recognized that the same workers\u2019 compensation term can have different meanings, depending on the context in which it is used. In <em>State ex rel. Kaska v. Indus. Comm. </em>(1992), 63 Ohio St.3d 743, 746, 591 N.E.2d 235, we noted, \u201cPermanent <em>total </em>disability requires a claimant to demonstrate an inability to perform sustained remunerative employment. Temporary total disability, on the other hand, requires only an inability to return to the former position of employment.\u201d (Citation omitted and emphasis sic.)</p>\n<p id=\"b253-12\">{\u00b6 18} With respect to R.C. 4123.57(B), \u201closs of use\u201d means \u201closs of <em>uncorrected </em>vision.\u201d (Emphasis added.) R.C. 4123.58(C) does not use the word \u201cuncorrected.\u201d Thus, what is a total loss of use under R.C. 4123.57(B) might not be under R.C. 4123.58(C). See <em>State ex rel. Szatkowski v. Indus. Comm. </em>(1988), 39 Ohio St.3d 320, 530 N.E.2d 880. There, just as here, the claimant received an award for permanent partial loss of sight and then sought statutory permanent total <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"132\">*132</page-number>disability. Medical evidence, however, indicated that claimant\u2019s vision was \u201c \u2018correctable to normal in each eye with contact lenses.\u2019 \u201d Id. at 320-321, 530 N.E.2d 880. This evidence prompted the court of appeals in that case to conclude that the claimant did not have the permanent loss of use of both eyes that R.C. 4123.58(C) mandated.</p>\n<p id=\"b254-5\">{\u00b6 19} We agreed that because R.C. 4123.57(B) refers to \u201closs of uncorrected vision,\u201d later improvement by corrective means is irrelevant to an award under that section. R.C. 4123.58(C), however, does not refer to \u201closs of uncorrected vision,\u201d and thus corrected vision is relevant to awarding compensation for permanent total disability. We therefore held, based on <em>State ex rel. Gassmann v. Indus. Comm. </em>(1975), 41 Ohio St.2d 64, 70 O.O.2d 157, 322 N.E.2d 660, and <em>State ex rel. Walker v. Indus. Comm. </em>(1979), 58 Ohio St.2d 402, 12 O.O.3d 347, 390 N.E.2d 1190, that \u201cirreparable total loss of use\u201d is a prerequisite to recovery under R.C. 4123.58(C). <em>Szatkowski, </em>39 Ohio St.3d at 321, 530 N.E.2d 880. Because contact lenses had restored Szatkowski\u2019s sight, statutory permanent total disability compensation was unavailable.</p>\n<p id=\"b254-6\">{\u00b6 20} Reliance on <em>Szatkowski </em>in Kincaid\u2019s case is misplaced. The intermittent nature of Kincaid\u2019s blindness does not change the fact that he has total loss of sight; there is no evidence that this condition will change.</p>\n<p id=\"b254-7\">{\u00b6 21} Kincaid\u2019s vision has not improved since his award of permanent partial disability compensation. Kincaid argues that a finding of \u201c100% bilateral total loss of sight\u201d means that he is blind \u2014 whether for purposes of his scheduled-loss award akin to damages under R.C. 4123.57(B) or for compensation due to permanent impairment of his earning capacity under R.C. 4123.58(C). We agree that the commission\u2019s finding under R.C. 4123.57(B) that Kincaid had \u201c100% bilateral total loss of sight\u201d assumes \u201closs of uncorrected vision.\u201d However, for purposes of R.C. 4123.57(B), the fact that Kincaid is not always having visual interruption does not mean that his sight is effectively corrected.</p>\n<p id=\"b254-8\">{\u00b6 22} Dr. George F. Calloway concluded in his January 7, 2004 report supporting the permanent partial award: \u201cI would like to point out that this is only an intermittent complaint but that since he cannot predict or control the timing or the frequency of these attacks, in effect <em>he is disabled at all times because he could be disabled at any time.\u201d </em>(Emphasis added.)</p>\n<p id=\"b254-9\">{\u00b6 23} There is no evidence that Kincaid\u2019s vision has improved or been \u201ccorrected\u201d since the award of permanent partial disability. We therefore reverse the judgment of the court of appeals and grant the writ.</p>\n<p id=\"b254-10\">{\u00b6 24} The judgment of the court of appeals is reversed.</p>\n<p id=\"b254-11\">Judgment reversed.</p>\n<judges id=\"b254-12\">Pfeifer, Lundberg Stratton, O\u2019Connor and O\u2019Donnell, JJ., concur.</judges>\n<attorneys id=\"Aav\"><page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"133\">*133</page-number>Koltak &amp; Gibson, L.L.P., and Ronald J.
