Starr\u2019s request for temporary total disability compensation. On January 5, 2001, Starr was a 27-year-old elementary physical education teacher for Beavercreek City Schools. On that date, she was teaching a child how to dribble a basketball, and she tripped over the child\u2019s foot. Starr stumbled into a wall, hit her head, and has never worked since.</p>\n<p id=\"b571-17\">{\u00b6 2} A workers\u2019 compensation claim was originally allowed for \u201csprain of neck; sprain thoracic region; sprain acromioclavicular, right; contusion scalp (head); contusion face.\u201d On January 14, 2002, the claim was additionally allowed for <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"450\">*450</page-number>\u201cpost concussion syndrome.\u201d Effective July 19, 2002, temporary total disability compensation was terminated after maximum medical improvement was assessed.</p>\n<p id=\"b572-5\">{\u00b6 3} At approximately the same time, Starr moved for the additional allowance of posttraumatic stress disorder and anxiety disorder with panic attacks, based on reports from psychologist Doris Cohen, Ph.D., Michael B. Leach, Ph.D., and Magdi S. Rizk, M.D., opined that allowance of posttraumatic stress disorder was inappropriate because Starr\u2019s trip and fall was unlike any of the extreme traumatic stressors enumerated by the Diagnostic and Statistical Manual of Mental Disorders for that diagnosis. Consequently, that condition was specifically disallowed. \u201cAnxiety disorder with panic attacks,\u201d however, was made part of the claim.</p>\n<p id=\"b572-6\">{\u00b6 4} On July 14, 2004, Starr moved for temporary total disability compensation backdated to July 19, 2002, based on her allowed psychiatric condition. At some point thereafter, Dr. Cohen\u2019s treatment notes were submitted to appellee Industrial Commission of Ohio. Those notes, among other documents, were reviewed by Dr. David J. Greenwald, a psychologist, on January 30, 2005, as part of a medical-file review. He produced a lengthy and detailed report that was highly critical of Dr. Cohen\u2019s treatment. Dr. Greenwald suspected that many of Starr\u2019s psychiatric problems \u2014 if legitimate \u2014 stemmed from a pre-existing personality disorder unrelated to her industrial injury. Many of those same complaints, he observed, were not corroborated by neuropsychological testing. He was also troubled by Dr. Cohen\u2019s constant reinforcement of \u201cclaimant\u2019s adoption of the sick role.\u201d</p>\n<p id=\"b572-7\">{\u00b6 5} Dr. Greenwald had a \u201cnumber of issues\u201d with Dr. Cohen\u2019s course of treatment:</p>\n<p id=\"b572-8\">{\u00b6 6} \u201cBased upon my review of her office notes, it was evident that there was no treatment plan or specific treatment goals, and that the vast majority of the focus was on issues that are not related to the allowed psychological condition of this claim. Specifically, there was a great deal of focus on the claimant\u2019s i-eported headaches, on family or relationship issues, on reported depression (which was not supported by the testing of the neuropsychologist), and on treatment for reported cognitive impairment, but very little focus on the allowed condition of anxiety with panic attacks. I also found no evidence of symptomatology that would meet criteria for a panic attack, and no treatment for panic attacks in the submitted records of Dr. Cohen. * * * There was also no evidence of a systematic approach geared to addressing anxiety that was directly related to the work injury. I also found no clear explanation regarding the connection between the work injury and the anxiety in these treatment records. * * * I found nothing in the notes to support disability due to the allowed psychological <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"451\">*451</page-number>condition. I also saw no evidence of any significant change in the claimant\u2019s psychological status over the course of 3 1/4 years of treatment.</p>\n<p id=\"b573-5\">{\u00b6 7} \u201c * * *</p>\n<p id=\"b573-6\">{\u00b6 8} \u201cI also take serious issue with Dr. Cohen\u2019s apparent efforts to provide the claimant with some type of treatment for the reported cognitive impairment. It should be noted that cognitive rehabilitation for brain injury requires a systematic, consistent approach to developing compensatory strategies to overcome cognitive impairment, and it requires a separate focused treatment plan that is not to be intermingled with psychotherapy. Furthermore, as I previously noted, the test data do not support the presence of significant cognitive impairment, nor does the injury itself, such that in addition to this treatment being inappropriate in the context of psychotherapy, it is also unnecessary. Related to this is Dr. Cohen\u2019s acceptance of the claimant\u2019s report of cognitive impairment, which therefore served to reinforce her complaints of it.\u201d</p>\n<p id=\"b573-7\">{\u00b6 9} Turning finally to Starr\u2019s alleged disability, he concluded:</p>\n<p id=\"b573-8\">{\u00b6 10} \u201cIn my opinion, the claimant has most definitely reached maximum medical improvement for the allowed psychological condition of anxiety disorder with panic attacks. There was no evidence of significant improvement in the claimant\u2019s psychological status throughout the course of her psychological treatment. I find that the claimant had reached maximum medical improvement as of the time of Dr. Cohen\u2019s 5/24/02 summary report. It is also my opinion that there was no period of temporary total disability as a result of the allowed psychological condition. Support for this is found in the fact that the great majority of the psychotherapy was focused on unrelated issues, that the claimant\u2019s complaints of cognitive impairment are not supported by the data, that there was no reference to panic attacks in the treatment records, and that she was found to be able to return to her former position of employment without [physical] restriction in 2002. Consequently, the presence of disabling anxiety as a direct result of the work injury is not supported. * * * Finally, with respect to the need for continued psychological treatment, the records of Dr. Cohen show that the claimant has been in treatment for 3 1/4 years, without any evidence of any behavior change, or reported improvement in symptomatology. The claimant has most probably developed a strong dependency on her psychologist, but this is a reflection of the likely personality disorder, which is not related to this injury.\u201d {\u00b6 11} A staff hearing officer denied temporary total disability compensation based in part on Dr. Greenwald\u2019s report. The hearing officer also noted the lack of contemporaneously filed evidence of disability for 2002 and 2003. Further appeal was refused.</p>\n<p id=\"b573-9\">{\u00b6 12} Starr filed a complaint in mandamus in the Court of Appeals for Franklin County, alleging that the commission had abused its discretion in <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"452\">*452</page-number>denying temporary total disability compensation. The court of appeals disagreed, holding that Dr. Greenwald\u2019s report supported the commission\u2019s decision.</p>\n<attorneys id=\"AVS\">Mitchell A. Stern, for appellant.</attorneys>\n<p id=\"b574-5\">{\u00b6 13} This cause is now before this court on an appeal as of right.</p>\n<p id=\"b574-6\">{\u00b6 14} For 20 years, the standard for evidentiary review has been whether the relied-upon evidence constitutes \u201csome evidence * * * to support the commission\u2019s stated basis for its decision.\u201d <em>State ex rel. Burley v. Coil Packing, Inc. </em>(1987), 31 Ohio St.3d 18, 31 OBR 70, 508 N.E.2d 936, syllabus. Consistent with its exclusive authority to evaluate the weight and credibility of evidence, the commission is not required to explain why it favored one piece of evidence over another. <em>State ex rel. Dobbins v. Indus. Comm., </em>109 Ohio St.3d 235, 2006-Ohio-2286, 846 N.E.2d 1243, \u00b6 7. Moreover, \u201c[i]t is immaterial whether other evidence, even if greater in quality and/or quantity, supports a decision contrary to the commission\u2019s.\u201d <em>State ex rel. Pass v. C.S.T. Extraction Co. </em>(1996), 74 Ohio St.3d 373, 376, 658 N.E.2d 1055. Accordingly, it is irrelevant that Dr. Cohen\u2019s C-84 certifies temporary total disability compensation over the period in question. The issue is instead whether Dr. Greenwald\u2019s report supports compensation denial. The court of appeals ruled that Dr. Greenwald\u2019s report was \u201csome evidence\u201d supporting the commission\u2019s denial, and we affirm its judgment.</p>\n<p id=\"b574-7\">{\u00b6 15} Because Starr submitted her evidence belatedly, the commission was limited to obtaining a file review in order to get a second opinion on Starr\u2019s claimed disability over the period in question. Dr. Greenwald performed that review on January 30, 2005, and prepared an extensive and meticulously detailed report. After reviewing Dr. Cohen\u2019s office notes and the medical reports of all previous medical examiners, he opined that many of Starr\u2019s alleged psychological problems were attributable to a pre-existing personality disorder unrelated to her industrial injury. He noted that neuropsychological testing did not corroborate some of the more severe symptoms that Starr had consistently reported to Cohen. As indicated previously, Dr. Greenwald criticized Cohen\u2019s treatment and decisively stated that there was no temporary total disability attributable to the allowed psychological condition in this claim. His report is, therefore, \u201csome evidence\u201d supporting the commission\u2019s denial of temporary total disability compensation.</p>\n<p id=\"b574-8\">{\u00b6 16} The judgment of the court of appeals is affirmed.</p>\n<p id=\"b574-9\">Judgment affirmed.</p>\n<judges id=\"b574-10\">Moyer, C.J., Pfeifer, Lundberg Stratton, O\u2019Connor, O\u2019Donnell, Lanzinger and Cupp, JJ., concur.</judges>\n<attorneys id=\"AIZ\"><page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"453\">*453</page-number>Marc Dann, Attorney General, and Charissa D.
