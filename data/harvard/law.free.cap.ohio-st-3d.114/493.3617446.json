As a threshold matter, we confront a jurisdictional issue based on the appellant\u2019s assertion that appellee Washington County Board of Revision (\u201cBOR\u201d) failed to send its decision to the appellant by certified mail, as required by R.C. 5715.20. We hold that under the particular circumstances of this case, a waiver of the prescribed method of certification has occurred. On the merits, we conclude that the Board of Tax Appeals (\u201cBTA\u201d) acted unlawfully when it affirmed the BOR and upheld the auditor\u2019s original, cost-based valuation. Given the record before it, the BTA should have performed its duty to make an independent valuation of the property. On remand, we instruct the BTA to do so.</p>\n<p id=\"b616-12\">I</p>\n<p id=\"b616-13\">{\u00b6 2} Appellant, Colonial Village, filed a motion to remand, which asserts, for the first time, that the BOR sent its decision to Colonial Village by regular mail, rather than by certified mail. This allegation, if true, potentially affects the BTA\u2019s jurisdiction and, derivatively, our own jurisdiction to address the merits of this appeal.</p>\n<p id=\"b616-14\">{\u00b6 3} R.C. 5715.20(A) requires a board of revision to \u201ccertify its action by certified mail to the person in whose name the property is listed or sought to be listed and to the complainant if the complainant is not the person in whose name the property is listed or sought to be listed.\u201d R.C. 5717.01 provides that an <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"495\">*495</page-number>appeal \u201cmay be taken to the board of tax appeals within thirty days after the notice of the decision of the county board of revision is mailed as provided in division (A) of section 5715.20 of the Revised Code.\u201d</p>\n<p id=\"b617-5\">{\u00b6 4} Colonial Village argues that because the BOR failed to send its decision by certified mail as required by R.C. 5715.20, the period for filing an appeal to the BTA never began to run under R.C. 5717.01. Colonial Village contends, therefore, that the notice of appeal that it filed was premature and that the BTA did not have jurisdiction. Colonial Village further reasons that because the BTA did not have jurisdiction, the BTA\u2019s decision is a nullity and its ruling on the merits cannot properly be addressed by this court. Colonial Village argues that this case should be remanded so that the BOR can properly certify its decision in compliance with R.C. 5715.20. See <em>Cleveland Elec. Illum. Co. v. Lake Cty. Bd. of Revision, </em>96 Ohio St.3d 165, 2002-Ohio-4033, 772 N.E.2d 1160. That act would start the whole process of appeal all over again. Id. at \u00b6 22.</p>\n<p id=\"b617-6\">{\u00b6 5} Central to this argument is the factual contention that the BOR did not send its decision by certified mail. Colonial Village submits no evidence to support this allegation. The record contains the BOR\u2019s formal certification to the BTA, stating that the BOR \u201cmailed the decision by certified mail to all parties as prescribed by R.C. 5715.20.\u201d Colonial Village did not apprise the BTA that the county\u2019s certification was inaccurate, and it even stated in its brief to the BTA that it had \u201cfiled a timely appeal to the Ohio Board of Tax Appeals.\u201d Based on this information, the BTA could reasonably have understood itself to have jurisdiction over the case.</p>\n<p id=\"b617-7\">{\u00b6 6} The auditor argues that the case should not be remanded, but he does not state whether the BOR mailed its decision by certified mail. The BOR did not join in the response to Colonial Village\u2019s motion. In this context, we find it appropriate to admonish litigants that when a significant jurisdictional issue is raised, we expect the contending parties to state the facts, as they believe them, and to present evidence in support of their material allegations.</p>\n<p id=\"b617-8\">{\u00b6 7} Although the evidence is not conclusive in this case, we deny the motion to remand even assuming that the BOR did not send its decision by certified mail. The failure to use certified mail as required by R.C. 5715.20(A) belongs to that limited class of jurisdictional defects that may be waived under appropriate circumstances. See <em>Mantho v. Bd. of Liquor Control </em>(1954), 162 Ohio St. 37, 54 O.O. 1, 120 N.E.2d 730. We conclude that a waiver occurred in this case.</p>\n<p id=\"b617-9\">{\u00b6 8} In <em>Mantho, </em>an applicant for a liquor permit appealed from a denial under the Administrative Procedure Act. After the court of common pleas ruled in favor of the applicant, state liquor authorities appealed, and the court of appeals reversed. The permit applicant in <em>Mantho </em>moved the court of appeals to vacate its decision on the grounds that the appellate court did not have jurisdiction, <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"496\">*496</page-number>relying on <em>Corn v. Bd. of Liquor Control </em>(1953), 160 Ohio St. 9, 50 O.O. 479, 113 N.E.2d 360. The court of appeals vacated its judgment, and on appeal to this court, we concluded: \u201cThe Board of Liquor Control submitted itself to the jurisdiction of the Court of Appeals. The applicants had the right at that time to raise objections to the prosecuting of the appeals and to move for their dismissal. They did not exercise that right but proceeded in such manner as to constitute approval of the appeals. By such conduct they waived their right to raise the question of jurisdiction over the parties after judgment.\u201d <em>Mantho, </em>162 Ohio St. at 41-42, 54 O.O. 1, 120 N.E.2d 730.</p>\n<p id=\"b618-5\">{\u00b6 9} In this case, the BOR\u2019s valuation of Colonial Village\u2019s property constitutes a subject matter that ordinarily lies within the BTA\u2019s jurisdiction when a proper notice of appeal is filed pursuant to R.C. 5717.01. Colonial Village was plainly a proper party to pursue an appeal and was the type of party R.C. 5715.20(A) sought to protect by requiring certified mail service of the BOR decision. It follows that when none of the parties before the BTA raised the improper method of certification, that particular irregularity was waived. Accordingly, even though the BTA may not originally have had jurisdiction, it ultimately rendered a valid judgment, which is subject to appeal to this court on the merits. See <em>Mantho </em>at paragraph two of the syllabus.</p>\n<p id=\"b618-6\">{\u00b6 10} Our decision does not affect the many cases in which we have held that conditions for pursuing an appeal are mandatory and jurisdictional. See, e.g., <em>Am. Restaurant &amp; Lunch Co. v. dander </em>(1946), 147 Ohio St. 147, 34 O.O. 8, 70 N.E.2d 93, paragraph one of the syllabus (\u201cWhere a statute confers the right of appeal, adherence to the conditions thereby imposed is essential to the enjoyment of the right conferred\u201d); <em>Cleveland Elec. Illum., </em>96 Ohio St.3d 165, 2002-Ohio-4033, 772 N.E.2d 1160, at \u00b6 14-16; <em>Sun Refining &amp; Marketing Co. v. Brennan </em>(1987), 31 Ohio St.3d 306, 31 OBR 584, 511 N.E.2d 112, syllabus (\u201cThe fifteen-day appeal period provided in R.C. 119.12 does not commence to run until the agency whose order is being appealed fully complies with the procedural requirements set forth in R.C. 119.09\u201d). Moreover, there are times when jurisdiction can be raised late in the proceedings, including for the first time on appeal. <em>Cleveland Elec. Illum., </em>96 Ohio St.3d 165, 2002-Ohio-4033, 772 N.E.2d 1160, at \u00b6 16; <em>H.R. Options, Inc. v. Zaino, </em>100 Ohio St.3d 373, 2004-Ohio-1, 800 N.E.2d 740, \u00b6 8 (though raised late, an objection based on a jurisdictional defect was \u201cpreserved because a party cannot waive subject-matter jurisdiction, regardless of procedural deficiencies\u201d); <em>Jenkins v. Keller </em>(1966), 6 Ohio St.2d 122, 126, 35 O.O.2d 147, 216 N.E.2d 379 (\u201cwhere a court has no jurisdiction over the subject matter of an action, a challenge to jurisdiction on such ground may effectively be made for the first time on appeal in a reviewing court\u201d).</p>\n<p id=\"b619-4\"><page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"497\">*497</page-number>{\u00b6 11} The present case, however, is governed by <em>Mantho. </em>The defect in this case concerns not subject-matter jurisdiction but the method by which parties receive notice and exercise their right to litigate. Similar to the issue in <em>Mantho, </em>the question in this case is whether the BTA \u201cacquired jurisdiction of the persons\u201d despite the BOR\u2019s failure to properly certify its decision. <em>Mantho, </em>162 Ohio St. at 41, 54 O.O. 1, 120 N.E.2d 730. Similar to the board in <em>Mantho, </em>Colonial Village, by appealing, \u201csubmitted itself to the jurisdiction\u201d of the BTA, and the parties \u201chad the right at that time to raise objections to the prosecuting of the appeals.\u201d Id. Failure to object at the BTA means that the parties \u201cwaived their right to raise the question of jurisdiction over the parties after judgment.\u201d Id. at 41-42, 54 O.O. 1, 120 N.E.2d 730. In other words, a party to a BTA appeal pursuant to R.C. 5717.01 may waive the method of certification as to itself when it pursues an appeal and when no party contests jurisdiction before the BTA. The issuance of a BTA decision on the merits completes the waiver, and such a decision is valid and binding.</p>\n<p id=\"b619-5\">{\u00b6 12} Our holding does not conflict with the principles we articulated in <em>Cleveland Elec. Illum. </em>for two different reasons. First, the parties in <em>Cleveland Elec. Ilium, </em>fully litigated before the BTA the board of revision\u2019s failure to certify its decision to the Tax Commissioner. 96 Ohio St.3d 165, 2002-Ohio-4033, 772 N.E.2d 1160, at \u00b6 8. The parties in this case could have raised improper certification to the BTA, and the BTA would have been obliged to dismiss, if the certification was improper. But the issuance of the BTA\u2019s decision on the merits, under color of the BTA\u2019s jurisdiction, and in the absence of an objection, completed a waiver of that defect.</p>\n<p id=\"b619-6\">{\u00b6 13} Second, in <em>Cleveland Elec. Illum., </em>the boards of revision failed to certify their decisions to a third party \u2014 the Tax Commissioner \u2014 who did not himself pursue an appeal.<footnotemark>1</footnotemark> 96 Ohio St.3d 165, 2002-Ohio-4033, 772 N.E.2d 1160, at \u00b6 13. Because a principal purpose of the certification was to notify persons like the Tax Commissioner of the board of revision\u2019s decision so that, among other things, such persons could appeal, the purpose of requiring the certification had not been satisfied in <em>Cleveland Elec. Ilium. </em>We declined to regard the Tax Commissioner\u2019s own willingness to dispense with certification as constituting a waiver in <em>Cleveland Elec. Illum. </em>Id. at \u00b6 13,18. Moreover, because the jurisdictional fault concerned a notice that would permit the Tax Commissioner to exercise a statutorily recognized right to appeal and participate, any decision the BTA rendered would be a nullity. See, e.g., <em>Cincinnati School Dist. Bd. of Edn. v. Hamilton Cty. Bd. of Revision </em>(2000), 87 Ohio St.3d 363, 366-367, 721 N.E.2d 40. <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"498\">*498</page-number>Our holding in <em>Cleveland Elec. Illum. </em>applied only to future cases and cases that were pending; otherwise, our decision would have created a universe of void BTA decisions. <em>Cleveland Elec. Illum. </em>at \u00b6 20.</p>\n<p id=\"b620-5\">{\u00b6 14} By contrast, when a party that did not receive proper notice, like Colonial Village, perfects an otherwise valid appeal at the BTA, that action manifests the fulfillment of the statutory purpose, particularly once the BTA has issued its decision on the merits. A waiver occurred once the BTA issued its decision, and that decision may no longer be contested on the basis of a failure to comply with the certification requirement of R.C. 5715.20(A). See <em>Hausman v. Dayton </em>(Dec. 22, 1993), 2d Dist. No. 13647, 1993 WL 541649, affirmed in part and reversed in part on other grounds (1995), 73 Ohio St.3d 671, 653 N.E.2d 1190; <em>Serv. Emp. Internatl. Union Dist. 1199 v. Ohio Elections Comm., </em>158 Ohio App.3d 769, 2004-Ohio-5662, 822 N.E.2d 424, \u00b6 13.</p>\n<p id=\"b620-6\">{\u00b6 15} Finally, this case differs from the situation we recently confronted in <em>Hughes v. Ohio Dept. of Commerce, </em>114 Ohio St.3d 47, 2007-Ohio-2877, 868 N.E.2d 246. In that case, the state agency failed to serve notice of its decision as required by R.C. 119.09, with the result that the appeal period under R.C. 119.12 did not begin to run under the terms of R.C. 119.12. But no waiver occurred there because the failure of proper certification under R.C. 119.09 was raised at the common pleas court \u2014 -just as we have noted that the parties could have raised the improper certification at the BTA in this case. Because the certification issue in <em>Hughes </em>had been raised in the lower tribunal, the issue was preserved; the failure to raise the jurisdictional issue at the BTA in this case means that it is barred. We deny Colonial Village\u2019s motion to remand.</p>\n<p id=\"b620-7\">II</p>\n<p id=\"b620-8\">{\u00b6 16} On the merits, Colonial Village challenges the BTA\u2019s affirmance of the valuation reached by the BOR and the auditor. According to the auditor\u2019s property record card, the county auditor based the value assigned to the property on \u201creproduction cost,\u201d setting $329,230 as the cost figure for each of the five apartment buildings, $25,480 for an outbuilding, and $27,470 for the paved area. The six buildings were allowed 25 percent depreciation, and the paving 75 percent. The aggregate cost valuation figure for the improvements was $1,260,580, which together with a land value of $60,400 yielded a property value of $1,320,980.</p>\n<p id=\"b620-9\">{\u00b6 17} Colonial Village presented its opinion of value as an owner to the BOR. The opinion stated that the improvements constitute federally subsidized housing, for which tenants pay 30 percent of their adjusted gross income as rent, with the federal government paying the remainder of the specified monthly rental fee. <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"499\">*499</page-number>There are a total of 45 apartments, of which 35 are two-bedroom and 10 are three-bedroom units. Colonial Village\u2019s rent roll as of the tax lien date, January 1, 2003, showed an average contract rent figure of $590 per month. Because of government subsidies, the amount of that rent paid by tenants averaged $108 per month. The average contract rent for the three-bedroom units was $665 per month; the average contract rent for the two-bedroom units was $568 per month. By contrast, the opinion\u2019s market study indicated that rent for unsubsidized properties would not exceed $435 for a two-bedroom unit and $495 for a three-bedroom unit. Based on the income approach, Colonial Village valued its property at $916,000, based on its HUD financial statements and an estimated capitalization rate. The BOR rejected the owner\u2019s opinion, finding that the capitalization rate was too high and that the expenses were not based on the market. Accordingly, the BOR retained the auditor\u2019s valuation.</p>\n<p id=\"b621-5\">{\u00b6 18} At the BTA, Colonial Village offered an appraisal report and supporting testimony from appraiser Charles Snyder. Snyder rejected the cost approach as \u201cprecluded from consideration due to the chronological and effective age of the physical improvements.\u201d Snyder used five comparables for a comparative-sales analysis and conducted an income-capitalization analysis. The latter relied on the use of rent comparables to arrive at an economic rent figure of $445-$495 per month. Snyder used actual expenses in his income approach and estimated a capitalization rate. After weighting the income approach at 80 percent and the comparative-sales approach at 20 percent, Snyder arrived at a value of $917,000 (net of furniture, fixtures, and equipment). The BTA found significant defects in the comparative-sales approach and faulted the income-capitalization analysis because the vacancy loss and expense figures were unsupported. Based on its findings, the BTA rejected the appraisal, accepted the BOR\u2019s analysis of the evidence presented to it, and retained the auditor\u2019s cost-based valuation of the property.</p>\n<p id=\"b621-6\">{\u00b6 19} The BTA possesses \u201cwide discretion in weighing the evidence and judging the credibility of witnesses.\u201d <em>DAK, PLL v. Franklin Cty. Bd. of Revision, </em>105 Ohio St.3d 84, 2005-Ohio-573, 822 N.E.2d 790, \u00b6 15. In this case, the BTA found specific flaws in the appraiser\u2019s conclusion of value, and we defer to those specific findings. In doing so, we conclude that the BTA was justified in declining to accept the appraiser\u2019s conclusion of value. This case presents a further question: whether, having validly rejected Colonial Village\u2019s proposed valuation of the property, the BTA could properly revert to the auditor\u2019s cost-based valuation. Colonial Village contends that the BTA committed legal error in doing so. We agree.</p>\n<p id=\"b621-7\">{\u00b6 20} For subsidized housing, we generally disfavor appraisals based on the cost approach. <em>Canton Towers, Ltd. v. Stark Cty. Bd. of Revision </em>(1983), 3 Ohio <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"500\">*500</page-number>St.3d 4, 7, 3 OBR 302, 444 N.E.2d 1027 (\u201cWithout a federal loan guarantee, favorable mortgage terms, rent subsidy, and income tax advantages, the cost of construction for such housing would be prohibitively expensive\u201d); <em>Alliance Towers, Ltd. v.

A \u201ccost approach\u201d appraisal analysis is \u201c \u2018 \u201cbased on the proposition that the informed purchaser would pay no more than the cost of producing a substitute property with the same utility as the subject property.\u201d \u2019 \u201d <em>Dinner Bell Meats, Inc. v. Cuyahoga Cty.

The BTA found no fault with this portion of Colonial Village\u2019s evidence, and the expert testimony accords with the general theory that \u201c[bjecause cost and market value are usually more closely related when properties are new, the cost approach is important in estimating the market value of new or relatively new construction.\u201d Appraisal Institute, The Appraisal of Real Estate (12th Ed.2001) 354.</p>\n<p id=\"b622-6\">{\u00b6 22} Our disfavor of the cost approach in the appraisal of subsidized housing and the age of the housing militate against retaining the county\u2019s valuation of the property.<footnotemark>2</footnotemark> The BTA did not articulate why a departure from these general principles is justified. Instead, it reverted to the cost-based valuation solely on the ground that Colonial Village failed to meet its burden of persuasion. Given the record in this case, we conclude that the BTA committed legal error.</p>\n<p id=\"b622-7\">{\u00b6 23} \u201cThe burden is on the taxpayer to prove his right to a deduction,\u201d and the taxpayer \u201cis not entitled to the deduction claimed merely because no evidence is adduced contra his claim.\u201d <em>W.

Cuyahoga Cty. Bd. of Revision </em>(1998), 81 Ohio St.3d 47, 49, 689 N.E.2d 22. We have also held that decisions of boards of revision should not be accorded a presumption of validity. <em>Columbus Bd. of Edn. v. Franklin Cty. Bd. of Revision </em>(1996), 76 Ohio St.3d 13, 15, 665 N.E.2d 1098; <em>Springfield Local Bd. of Edn. v. Summit Cty. Bd. of Revision </em>(1994), 68 Ohio St.3d 493, 494, 628 N.E.2d 1365. The BTA must \u201c \u2018independently weigh and evaluate all evidence properly before it\u2019 \u201d in order to \u201c \u2018make an independent determination concerning the valuation of the property at issue.\u2019\u201d <em>Columbus Bd. of Edn., </em>76 Ohio St.3d at 16, 665 N.E.2d 1098, quoting <em>Black v. Cuyahoga Cty.

Our cases that address subsidized housing emphasize the propriety of an income approach calculated with \u201cdue regard for market rent and current returns on mortgages and equities.\u201d <em>Alliance Towers, </em>37 Ohio St.3d 16, 523 N.E.2d 826, paragraph two of the syllabus. The record contains ample information for the BTA to \u201cdetermine the taxable value of the property.\u201d See R.C. 5717.03. The owner\u2019s opinion of value presented to the BOR and the appraisal report presented to the BTA contain market rent data. The record also contains evidence of market expenses, which can be used in valuing the property. The BTA faulted the vacancy-loss figure used by the appraiser, but alternatives are available. Colonial Village\u2019s representative at the BOR hearing testified as to actual vacancy during the relevant time. The BTA could rely on this information, or it could omit any allowance for vacancy loss. In valuing subsidized housing for real property taxation, an income approach to valuation that uses market rents and expenses is preferable to a cost approach, even without a full accounting for vacancy loss. Finally, the BTA made no adverse findings as to the appraiser\u2019s derivation of a capitalization rate, and the appraisal report contains evidence of the appraiser\u2019s direct capitalization and band-of-investment analyses, including the discussion of mortgages and equities.</p>\n<p id=\"b623-6\">{\u00b6 25} We reverse the decision of the BTA and remand with instructions that the BTA \u201cdetermine the taxable value of the property,\u201d as required by R.C. 5717.03.</p>\n<p id=\"b623-7\">Decision reversed and cause remanded.</p>\n<judges id=\"b623-8\">Moyer, C.J., Lundberg Stratton, O\u2019Connor, O\u2019Donnell and Lanzinger, JJ., concur.</judges>\n<judges id=\"b623-9\">Cupp, J., concurs in judgment only.</judges>\n<attorneys id=\"Aiu-\"><page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"502\">*502</page-number>Karen H.

The auditor and the BOR argue at pages 17 and 18 of their brief that the auditor\u2019s valuation \u201ccould just as easily be the result of a combination\u201d of various techniques, rather than a cost-based approach as indicated on the property record card. We decline to accept this invitation to speculate that the property record card means anything other than what it says. If the auditor believed it important to clarify the method used, he should have presented evidence on that point.</p>\n</footnote>\n</opinion>\n</casebody>\n",
