McMahon of Bay Village, Ohio, Attorney Registration No. 0001304, to the practice of law in Ohio in 1975.</p>\n<p id=\"b453-18\">{\u00b6 2} The Board of Commissioners on Grievances and Discipline recommends that we now suspend respondent\u2019s license to practice for six months and conditionally stay the suspension based on findings that he fabricated information in correspondence to an insurance company while representing a client in a personal-injury claim. Respondent objects to the recommended sanction, argu<page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"332\">*332</page-number>ing that a public reprimand is appropriate based on mitigating factors and precedent. On review, we agree that respondent violated the Code of Professional Responsibility as found by the board, and we overrule his objections as to the recommended sanction. Moreover, because respondent intentionally invented evidence to deceive an adversary, we hold that the recommended six-month stayed suspension is too lenient and order respondent to serve a six-month actual suspension from the practice of law.</p>\n<p id=\"b454-4\">{\u00b6 3} Relator, Cleveland Bar Association, charged respondent with, among other misconduct not found by the board, violations of DR 1 \u2014 102(A)(4) (prohibiting a lawyer from engaging in conduct involving dishonesty, fraud, deceit, or misrepresentation), 7-102(A)(5) (prohibiting a lawyer from knowingly making a false statement of fact), and 7-102(A)(8) (prohibiting a lawyer from engaging in other illegal conduct or conduct contrary to a Disciplinary Rule). Respondent admitted these violations. A three-member panel of the board heard the cause, found the cited misconduct, and recommended a public reprimand. The board found only the violations of DR 1-102(A)(4) and 7-102(A)(5), dismissing the DR 7-102(A)(8) violation as redundant, and recommended the six-month suspension and that the suspension be stayed on the condition that respondent commit no further misconduct.</p>\n<p id=\"b454-5\">Misconduct</p>\n<p id=\"b454-6\">{\u00b6 4} Respondent has practiced law for over 30 years, primarily in civil cases, and has represented over 3,000 clients, many in personal-injury claims. The charges of misconduct arose out of a personal-injury case in which respondent represented a passenger who had sustained minor injuries in a two-car accident. The accident took place on July 1, 2004, in Shaker Heights, Ohio, when Jerri Marrs, the driver of the second car, collided with the car in which respondent\u2019s client was riding. Police cited Marrs for improperly changing lanes.</p>\n<p id=\"b454-7\">{\u00b6 5} Respondent insisted that the accident was Marrs\u2019s fault, but State Auto Mutual Insurance Company (\u201cState Auto\u201d), Marrs\u2019s insurer, initially disputed liability. To persuade State Auto to enter into settlement negotiations, respondent sent a letter to the insurance carrier on August 20, 2004. That letter is at the heart of the charges against respondent.</p>\n<p id=\"b454-8\">{\u00b6 6} In the August 20 letter, respondent fabricated testimony that he identified as being verbatim from a nonexistent transcript ostensibly from a \u201cShaker Heights Court \u2014 July, 2004\u201d proceeding. Respondent represented that this colloquy had occurred:</p>\n<p id=\"b454-9\">{\u00b6 7} \u201cJudge: Ms. Jerri Lynn Marrs \u2014 How do you plead on the charge of improper lane change at Fairmont Circle in Shaker Heights, Ohio?</p>\n<p id=\"b454-10\">{\u00b6 8} \u201cMs. Marrs: No contest, your Honor.</p>\n<p id=\"b455-3\"><page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"333\">*333</page-number>{\u00b6 9} \u201cJudge: Do you have any thing to say in your defense?</p>\n<p id=\"b455-4\">{\u00b6 10} \u201cMs. Marrs: I was unfortunately in the wrong lane for proceeding straight in the intersection and by mistake, hit the other car in its lane.</p>\n<p id=\"b455-5\">{\u00b6 11} \u201cJudge: I assume that since you are not contesting the traffic charge that you were at fault for this accident?</p>\n<p id=\"b455-6\">{\u00b6 12} \u201cMs. Marrs: Yes, your Honor. The accident was my fault.</p>\n<p id=\"b455-7\">{\u00b6 13} \u201cJudge: Then I find you guilty on the charge of improper lane change, causing an accident, and you are fined $100.00, plus court costs.</p>\n<p id=\"b455-8\">{\u00b6 14} \u201cMs. Marrs: I\u2019m sorry for causing this accident, your Honor, but I have auto insurance to pay for the other car\u2019s damages and their injuries.</p>\n<p id=\"b455-9\">{\u00b6 15} \u201cJudge: Please drive more carefully in the future, Ms. Marrs.</p>\n<p id=\"b455-10\">{\u00b6 16} \u201cMs. Marrs: Yes, your Honor.\u201d</p>\n<p id=\"b455-11\">{\u00b6 17} Respondent\u2019s letter to State Auto concluded:</p>\n<p id=\"b455-12\">{\u00b6 18} \u201cBased upon Ms. Marrs court appearance where the Court officially found her guilty of the traffic charge, Ms. Marrs is solely liable for causing this accident. Once I obtain all of [respondent\u2019s client\u2019s] medical records and expenses, these documents will be forwarded to you for the purpose of your settling this liability case.\u201d</p>\n<p id=\"b455-13\">{\u00b6 19} In fact, Marrs had failed to appear in court to answer to the charge of improperly changing lanes, she had never admitted fault on the record, and she had never been \u201cofficially found * * * guilty\u201d of this traffic offense. Respondent\u2019s August 20 letter thus contained demonstrably false information about Marrs and, by implication, about whether State Auto had any responsibility to indemnify those injured in the July 2004 auto accident.</p>\n<p id=\"b455-14\">{\u00b6 20} In a September 21, 2004 letter, a State Auto claims representative informed respondent that Marrs had not appeared in court and that State Auto still denied liability. <em>On </em>October 12, 2004, respondent replied, acknowledging that court records confirmed Marrs\u2019s failure to appear, adding that \u201cthe court has issued a warrant for her arrest for failing to appear in court.\u201d He also continued to aggressively assert Marrs\u2019s responsibility for the collision, promising State Auto that he would conduct depositions of its insured, even \u201cin her cell.\u201d</p>\n<p id=\"b455-15\">{\u00b6 21} State Auto ultimately settled with respondent\u2019s client in June 2005 for $8,500. In the course of settlement negotiations, respondent wrote to the claims representative on June 20, 2005, and vaguely apologized for remarks made in his August 20 and October 12 letters. State Auto apparently never relied on the false information that respondent had provided initially.</p>\n<p id=\"b455-16\">{\u00b6 22} Respondent has no reliable explanation for why he fabricated facts in his August 20 letter. During relator\u2019s investigation, he stated that he may have <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"334\">*334</page-number>simply assumed that Marrs had appeared in court, as usually occurs after a traffic citation, and that she had been found guilty. And at the panel hearing, respondent claimed that he actually did not recall composing and sending the August 20 letter and that he had been \u201cstunned\u201d when confronted with his misstatements. He also suggested that he might have been trying to figuratively depict the likely outcome of Marrs\u2019s traffic citation. In the end, however, he described the correspondence as \u201csenseless\u201d and basically inexplicable.</p>\n<p id=\"b456-5\">{\u00b6 23} Respondent admits that he knowingly made a false statement of fact and acted dishonestly in fabricating information for the August 20 letter to State Auto. We therefore adopt the board\u2019s findings that he violated DR 1-102(A)(4) and 7-102(A)(5).</p>\n<p id=\"b456-6\">Sanction</p>\n<p id=\"b456-7\">{\u00b6 24} When imposing sanctions for attorney misconduct, we consider the duties violated, the actual or potential injury caused, the attorney\u2019s mental state, and sanctions imposed in similar cases. <em>Disciplinary Counsel v. Brown </em>(1999), 87 Ohio St.3d 316, 318, 720 N.E.2d 525. See, also, <em>Stark Cty. Bar Assn. v. Buttacavoli, </em>96 Ohio St.3d 424, 2002-Ohio-4743, 775 N.E.2d 818, \u00b6 16. Before making a final determination, we also weigh evidence of the aggravating and mitigating factors listed in Section 10 of the Rules and Regulations Governing Procedure on Complaints and Hearings Before the Board of Commissioners on Grievances and Discipline (\u201cBCGD Proc.Reg.\u201d). <em>Cleveland Bar Assn. v. Glatki </em>(2000), 88 Ohio St.3d 381, 384, 726 N.E.2d 993.</p>\n<p id=\"b456-8\">{\u00b6 25} Respondent flagrantly violated his duty to the legal system by attempting to advance his client\u2019s interests with evidence that he knowingly fabricated. And though State Auto employees discovered the fabrication before relying on it to the insurance carrier\u2019s detriment, respondent also breached his duty to the general public by failing to exhibit the highest standards of honesty and integrity. Respondent claims that a public reprimand is enough to deter and protect the public from such ethical lapses. We disagree.</p>\n<p id=\"b456-9\">{\u00b6 26} Respondent has enjoyed a long legal career with no previous disciplinary measures, his misconduct did not cause financial loss, he cooperated in the disciplinary process, he has apologized and accepted responsibility for his misdeeds, which occurred during a particularly stressful period, and he has established his excellent character and reputation apart from this one isolated incident of wrongdoing. See BCGD Proc.Reg. 10(B)(2)(a), (c), (d), (e). We relied on these same mitigating factors, to varying degrees, in <em>Disciplinary Counsel v. Agopian, </em>112 Ohio St.3d 103, 2006-Ohio-6510, 858 N.E.2d 368, \u00b6 15; <em>Disciplinary Counsel v. Cuckler, </em>101 Ohio St.3d 318, 2004-Ohio-784, 804 N.E.2d 966, \u00b6 7; and <em>Disciplinary Counsel v. Eisenberg </em>(1998), 81 Ohio St.3d 295, 296, 690 N.E.2d 1282, all cited by respondent, in deciding to publicly reprimand lawyers for their violations of <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"335\">*335</page-number>DR 1-102(A)(4), rather than impose the actual suspensions that dishonest conduct generally requires. <em>Disciplinary Counsel v. Fowerbaugh </em>(1995), 74 Ohio St.3d 187, 658 N.E.2d 237, syllabus. In none of these cases, however, did the lawyers as deliberately exceed the bounds of our standard for truthfulness as has respondent.</p>\n<attorneys id=\"AmQA\">Thompson Hi\u00f1e L.L.P., Jennifer S. Roach, and Samer M. Musallam, for relator.</attorneys>\n<attorneys id=\"A6H\">Thomas Repicky, for respondent.</attorneys>\n<p id=\"b457-4\">{\u00b6 27} Here, respondent unabashedly invented text of a purported transcript, complete with an adverse party\u2019s admission of fault, and forwarded the text as a quotation to the claims representative at State Auto. The claims representative contradicted respondent\u2019s misstatements, but in his return correspondence three weeks later, we see none of the \u201cstunned\u201d sheepishness with which respondent supposedly reacted. To the contrary, respondent essentially ignored the gaffe and continued to press his client\u2019s case.</p>\n<p id=\"b457-5\">{\u00b628} We find respondent\u2019s fabrication a \u201cdeliberate effort to deceive\u201d that distinguishes his case from those involving inadvertence or haphazard corner-cutting. <em>Agopian, </em>112 Ohio St.3d 103, 2006-Ohio-6510, 858 N.E.2d 368, \u00b6 13. Indeed, for the audacity of respondent\u2019s ethical violations, the general rule requiring an actual suspension from the practice of law must apply. See <em>Cincinnati Bar Assn. v. Florez, </em>98 Ohio St.3d 448, 2003-Ohio-1730, 786 N.E.2d 875 (lawyer suspended from the practice of law for six months because he failed to file a tax form for his client and then fabricated evidence during the disciplinary investigation to cover up the misconduct).</p>\n<p id=\"b457-6\">{\u00b6 29} Lawyers who choose to engage in fabrication of evidence, deceit, misrepresentation of facts, and distortion of truth do so at their peril. They are admonished that the practice of law is not a right, and our code of professional responsibility demands far more of those in our profession. Here, respondent has presented much evidence in mitigation, but an actual suspension is appropriate for this conduct.</p>\n<p id=\"b457-7\">{\u00b6 30} Respondent is therefore suspended from the practice of law in Ohio for six months. Costs are taxed to respondent.</p>\n<p id=\"b457-8\">Judgment accordingly.</p>\n<judges id=\"b457-9\">Moyer, C.J., Lundberg Stratton, O\u2019Connor and Cupp, JJ., concur.</judges>\n<judges id=\"b457-10\">Lanzinger, J., concurs in judgment only.</judges>\n<judges id=\"b457-11\">Pfeifer and O\u2019Donnell, JJ., dissent and would impose a six-month stayed suspension.</judges>\n</opinion>\n</casebody>\n",
