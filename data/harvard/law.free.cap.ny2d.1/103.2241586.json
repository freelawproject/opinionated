Giving plaintiff the benefit of every reasonable inference, her proof was legally insufficient to sustain the allegations of the complaint or to support a verdict in her favor. <em>(Pollock </em>v. <em>Pollock, </em>71 N.

Y. 283.)</p>\n<opinion data-order=\"7\" data-type=\"opinion\" id=\"x999-1\" type=\"majority\">\n<author id=\"b131-5\">Fuld, J.</author>\n<p id=\"A2s\">Plaintiff, now 87 years of age, is a sister-in-law of Nellie Childs who died in 1946; defendants are the latter\u2019s children who were named by her as executors in her last will and testament. It is a provision of that will, Paragraph Third, which now engages our attention; in it, Mrs. Childs declared:</p>\n<blockquote id=\"b131-6\"><em>\u201c </em>I request my two children, Richard S. Childs and Mary Childs Draper, or the survivor of them, to pay to my sister-in-law, Mary Parker Spencer, now residing at Manchester, Connecticut, the sum of Two hundred and eight dollars and thirty-three cents ($208.33) per month as long as she shall live.\u201d</blockquote>\n<p id=\"b131-7\">Plaintiff, maintaining that the verb \u201c request,\u201d read in context, is to be construed as a direction to pay her the sum specified, sues in contract (see, e.g., <em>Redfield </em>v. <em>Redfield, </em>126 N. Y. 466; <em>Brown </em>v. <em>Knapp, </em>79 N. Y. 136, 143; <em>Gridley </em>v. <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"106\">*106</page-number><em>Gridley, </em>24 N. Y. 130, 138) upon defendants\u2019 implied promise to pay, a promise implied from their acceptance of the residuary estate.</p>\n<p id=\"b132-4\">Mrs. Childs executed her will in 1944, two years before her death. After providing for a number of legacies, including bequests to plaintiff\u2019s two sons and to charity, she directed, in Paragraph Ninth, that the residue of her estate be equally divided between the two defendants. The estate consisted of over $2,500,000, the residuary estate, after taxes had been paid, of more than $1,000,000.</p>\n<p id=\"b132-5\">Plaintiff had married Mrs. Childs \u2019 brother in 1892 and, during their many years of marriage, Mrs. Childs had contributed to their support. In 1928, she made a will, providing for a trust of $100,000, the income \u2014 in the neighborhood of $208 a month \u2014 to be used for the support of her brother, and, if he predeceased plaintiff, then, for her support for life. After her brother died in 1932, Mrs. Childs gave plaintiff $208.33 a month, and these payments continued until March, 1945. In the meantime, she executed the will before us, which, as we have seen, contained the clause requesting defendants to pay plaintiff the very same sum each and every month as long as she lived. Following his mother\u2019s decease, Richard, one of defendants, wrote plaintiff a letter, informing her of the will provision and advising that \u201c monthly checks \u201d would be sent \u201c about the first of each month \u2019 <em>\u2019; </em>and he added that she should \u2018 <em>\u2018 </em>always endorse the checks for deposit personally, as they will be part of our accounting to the court. \u2019 \u2019 The checks were sent for two years \u2014 until plaintiff was 79 years old \u2014 and then they stopped.</p>\n<p id=\"b132-6\">The present action, brought some years later, seeks to recover the amount which has assertedly accumulated. Defendants\u2019 motion to dismiss the complaint for insufficiency was denied at Special Term and that decision was affirmed by the Appellate Division (283 App. Div. 788). Upon the trial thereafter held, there was a verdict for plaintiff, and, upon appeal, the Appellate Division affirmed, one justice dissenting.</p>\n<p id=\"b132-7\">Cases such as the present and <em>Matter of Daly </em>\u2014 also decided today <em>(supra, </em>p. 100) \u2014well illustrate the aptness of Judge Learned Hand\u2019s wise and trenchant observation that courts should be wary of making \u2018 \u2018 a fortress out of the dictionary \u2019 \u2019, since there \u201c is no more likely way to misapprehend the meaning of language * * * than to read the words literally, forget<page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"107\">*107</page-number>ting the object which the document as a whole \u201d seeks to achieve. <em>(Cabell </em>v. <em>Markham, </em>148 F. 2d 737, 739; <em>Central Hanover Bank &amp; Trust Co. </em>v. <em>Commissioner, </em>159 F. 2d 167, 169.) \u201c A word * * * may very greatly in color and content \u2019 \u2019 according to the intent of its author and the circumstances under which it is used. <em>(Towne </em>v. <em>Eisner, </em>245 U. S. 418, 425.) And so it is with words such as \u201crequest,\u201d \u201cwish\u201d and \u201c desire.\u201d Although ordinarily to be read as precatory (see <em>Matter of Daly, supra, </em>at p. 102), they will be taken to connote a hope or a command depending on whether the author 1 \u2018 meant by them simply to advise or inform a discretion which is vested in somebody or to control or direct a certain disposition.\u201d (7 Warren\u2019s Heaton on Surrogates\u2019 Courts [6th ed., 1951], p. 184.) In seeking an answer to the question, the testator\u2019s intent and meaning are to be gathered, not alone from the language and terms of the instrument itself, but also from the conditions and circumstances extrinsic to it. (See <em>Collister </em>v. <em>Fassitt, </em>163 N. Y. 281, 286; see, also, 3 Page on Wills [3d ed., 1941], \u00a7 1179.)</p>\n<p id=\"b133-6\">One circumstance, indicative of a direction, is the degree of clarity and precision employed by the testator in describing the disposition in question \u2014 that is, the persons to take, the subject matter or amount of the gift, its terms and duration. (See, e.g., <em>Colton </em>v. <em>Colton, </em>127 U. S. 300, 315; <em>Matter of Bluestein, </em>302 N. Y. 760, affg. 277 App. Div. 385; <em>Phillips </em>v. <em>Phillips, </em>112 N. Y. 197, 204; see, also, 2 Jarman on Wills [8th ed., 1951], pp. 866-867.) A like indication is furnished by the fact that the \u201crequest\u201d is addressed to a close relative, for, it has been remarked, \u201c it would be but natural for the testator to suppose that a request, which, in its terms, implied no alternative * * * would be understood and obeyed as strictly as though it were couched in the language of direction and command. In such a case * * * \u2018 the mode is only civility.\u2019 \u201d <em>(Colton </em>v. <em>Colton, supra, </em>127 U. S. 300, 319; see, also, Notes, 49 A. L. B. 31, 34; 107 A. L. B. 904.) And another signpost is found in the circumstance that the bequest, precatory in tone, precedes the clause disposing of the general or residuary estate out of which the gift is to come. (See <em>Collister </em>v. <em>Fassitt, supra, </em>163 N. Y. 281, 287 <em>et seq.)</em></p>\n<p id=\"b133-10\">In <em>Phillips </em>v. <em>Phillips (supra, </em>112 N. Y. 197), a leading case, the testator, after providing that the whole of his property <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"108\">*108</page-number>should go to his wife, added that, \u20181 If she find it always convenient to pay my sister Caroline Buck the sum of three hundred dollars a year, and also to give my brother, Edwin W., during his life the interest on ten thousand dollars (or seven hundred dollars per year), I wish it to be done.\u201d The court held that he word \u201c wish \u201d was meant to be imperative, and, in reaching that conclusion, the court adverted both to such extrinsic factors as the wife\u2019s comfortable circumstances and the absence of children and to the definiteness and clarity of the bequest. \u2018 \u2018 It is perfectly well settled \u2019 \u2019, said the court, <em>\u2018 </em>\u2018 that what are denominated precatory words, expressive of a wish or desire, may, in given instances, create a trust or impose a charge. Without a detailed consideration of the cases, it is quite clear, that, as a general rule, they turn upon one important and vital inquiry, and that is, whether the alleged bequest is so definite as to amount and subject-matter as to be capable of execution by the court, or whether it so depends upon the discretion of the general devisee as to be incapable of execution without superseding that discretion. In the latter case there can neither be a trust or a charge, while in the former there may be, and will be, if such appears to have been the testamentary intention \u201d (112 N. Y., at p. 204). And in <em>Matter of Bluestein (supra, </em>302 N. Y. 760, affg. 277 App. Div. 385), both the language of the testament and the attendant circumstances were said to support the conclusion that, in context, the testator\u2019s \u201c request \u201d bespoke a direction, imposing an obligation upon the legatee. By his will, he left his partner \u2018 <em>\u2018 </em>any and all interest in \u2019 \u2019 his accounting practice with the \u20181 request \u2019 \u2019 that \u2018 \u2018 he continue the same and pay out of such practice \u201d to his wife Rose the sum of $150 a month \u201c for one hundred twenty months, or for her life if she die sooner, immediately following my demise.\u201d We held that this language amounted to a binding direction, the Appellate Division, whose order we affirmed, writing, \u201cWe are of the opinion, construing the will as a whole, that the distinctive language employed by the testator clearly imports an obligation \u2014 a legal obligation \u2014 by the legatee if he accepts the legacy bequeathed to him to make payment to the widow in the manner therein described. The amount, the duration, the subject matter, and the recipient of the obligation are all clearly and definitely expressed. All this would indicate that the intention of the testator was not to use precatory words expressing desire or <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"109\">*109</page-number>hope but to use words giving \u2018 an express, binding direction. \u2019 \u2019 \u2019 (277 App. Div., at pp. 386-387.)</p>\n<p id=\"b135-4\">Turning to the will under consideration, it is but necessary to observe that the suggested guides and signposts all point the conclusion, reached by the courts below, that the \u201c request \u201d reflected a direction.</p>\n<p id=\"b135-5\">In the first place, the \u20181 request \u2019 \u2019 is addressed to \u2018 \u2018 my two children \u2019 \u2019 \u2014 which their mother could expect would be understood and obeyed as strictly as if couched in language of command. In the second place, the amount of the gift is given to the penny and the other details are set forth in the most precise and explicit terms. By providing that her son and daughter (or, upon the death of one, the \u201c survivor \u201d) were to pay plaintiff $208.33 each and every month during her life, testatrix could not have been more definite or left less to their independent judgment. In the third place, the fact that the provision for plaintiff \u201c [stood] first in the will \u201d and that defendants were to receive the residue only after payments to plaintiff, manifested a design to charge such amounts to defendants. (Co<em>llister </em>v. <em>Fassitt, supra, </em>163 N. Y. 281, 287, 288-289.) And, in the fourth place, the further circumstances \u2014 the size of the estate left by testatrix, her children\u2019s great wealth, in contrast to the comparatively small gift to plaintiff, as well as the testatrix\u2019 long-continued practice of giving her $208.33 a month, the identical amount mentioned in the will \u2014 render it highly improbable that she intended defendants to be free to disregard the request and discontinue the monthly payments at their pleasure.</p>\n<p id=\"b135-6\">The judgment of the Appellate Division should be affirmed, with costs.</p>\n<p id=\"b135-7\">Desmond, Dye and Burke, JJ., concur with Fuld, J.; Van Voorhis, J., votes to reverse and to dismiss the complaint upon the ground that the words of the will on which plaintiff\u2019s cause of action is based are precatory but not mandatory; Conway, Ch. J., and Froessel, J., taking no part.</p>\n<p id=\"b135-8\">Judgment affirmed.</p>\n</opinion>\n</casebody>\n",
