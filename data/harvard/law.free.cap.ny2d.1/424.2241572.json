The award made after the death of respondent\u2019s intestate was null and void, and appellant\u2019s check made payable, under a mistake of fact, to respondent\u2019s intestate pursuant to such award conferred no right to this money either upon respondent\u2019s intestate or respondent. <em>(Pines </em>v. <em>Beck, </em>300 N.

Even if the Workmen\u2019s Compensation Board\u2019s award was made prior to the death of respondent\u2019s intestate, so that compensation was due to him at his death, such award did not confer any right to the money upon respondent. <em>(Matter of Bogold </em>v. <em>Bogold Bros., </em>218 App. Div. 676, 245 N.

The right of decedent, the claimant in the workmen\u2019s compensation proceedings, to the proceeds of the lump sum nonschedule adjustment vested in him on October 10, 1950. His death on October 24, 1950, one week before the formal filing and notice of the decision of the Workmen\u2019s Compensation Board, did not divest him of that right. <em>(Matter of Dodson </em>v. <em>Healey Co., </em>275 App. Div. 130, 300 N.

Y. 760). This record establishes and both courts below found that there was no such approval by the board until November 3; 1950. Claimant had died on October 24, 1950 but the employer, not knowing of the death, sent a check for the amount of the settlement which check was deposited by plaintiff as administratrix of claimant in her account as administratrix. Since the adjustment or settlement was as to workmen\u2019s compensation to accrue in the future and since the Workmen\u2019s Compensation Board has no jurisdiction of any kind as to such compensation not accruing before claimant\u2019s death, the board\u2019s award of November 3,1950, including its approval of the adjustment, was entirely without jurisdiction and a nullity. It follows that claimant\u2019s estate had no right to the proceeds of the check and that Special Term correctly decided that so much thereof as represented the amount of the- adjustment must be repaid to the employer.</p>\n<p id=\"b452-5\">The judgment of the Appellate Division should be reversed and the case remitted to the Supreme Court for further proceedings in accordance with this opinion.</p>\n</opinion>\n<opinion data-order=\"8\" data-type=\"opinion\" id=\"x999-2\" type=\"dissent\">\n<author id=\"b452-6\">Froessel, J.</author>\n<p id=\"A_N\">(dissenting). We dissent and vote for affirmance. The jurisdiction of all matters relating to the administration of the Workmen\u2019s Compensation Law is vested in the Workmen\u2019s Compensation Board (Workmen\u2019s Compensation Law, \u00a7 123), and its decisions are final and conclusive unless reversed on appeal (\u00a7 23). The avowed purpose and object of that statute is to remove such controversies from the courts. Determinations made by the Workmen\u2019s Compensation Board are <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"427\">*427</page-number>not open to review under an article 78 proceeding as is the case with other administrative boards and bodies. The review is authorized by appeal procedure only <em>(Doca </em>v. <em>Federal Stevedoring Co., </em>280 App. Div. 940, affd. 305 N. Y. 648).</p>\n<p id=\"b453-3\">The Workmen\u2019s Compensation Board was authorized to approve the lump sum nonscheduled adjustment in favor of Henry J. Zielinski. Both he and the defendant entered into a formal \u201c agreement for economic adjustment \u201d on February 28, 1950 which is equivalent to an offer to allow a determination to be made accordingly by the Workmen\u2019s Compensation Board. Immediately after the October 10,1950 hearing, at the conclusion of which decision was reserved, and on the selfsame day, Commissioner Amadei, according to his own testimony, and his fellow commissioner \u201c went into conference \u201d and made a <em>\u201c </em>decision * * * which was released under date of November 3rd \u201d. In the meantime and on October 24 claimant had died.</p>\n<p id=\"b453-5\">Section 478 of the Civil Practice Act provides: <em>\u201c </em>\u00a7 478. Judgment after death of party. If either party to an action dies after an <em>accepted offer </em>to allow judgment to be taken or after a verdict, report or <em>decision, </em>or an interlocutory judgment, but before final judgment is entered, the court must enter final judgment in the names of the original parties unless the offer, verdict, report or decision, or the interlocutory judgment, is set aside. * * * A judgment shall not be entered <em>against </em>a party who dies before a verdict, report or decision is actually rendered against him. In that case, the verdict, report or decision is void.\u201d (Emphasis supplied.) While the Workmen\u2019s Compensation Law does not have a similar provision, in the conduct of hearings it generally follows the practice prescribed in that act, except as otherwise provided in the Workmen\u2019s Compensation Law, and with much greater liberality.</p>\n<p id=\"b453-7\">By adopting the practice prescribed in section 478 of the Civil Practice Act, which would be following legislative policy in such a situation as this, the case before us comes clearly within its provisions, for here was an offer of settlement resulting in a \u201c decision \u2019 \u2019 on the very day of the October 10th hearing and while claimant was still alive. The claim should not be defeated because it took some days to formalize that determination, notwithstanding claimant\u2019s death in the interim. We thus have here an accepted offer to allow a determination to be <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"428\">*428</page-number>made and we also have a report, \u201c decision \u201d or interlocutory determination\u2014call it what one will \u2014 before the final determination was entered.</p>\n<p id=\"b454-4\">Under these circumstances, the Workmen\u2019s Compensation Board was authorized to enter the final determination in the name of the original claimant, Henry J. Zielinski, so long as the offer, report, decision or interlocutory determination was not set aside and so long as determination was not against the party who died (Civ. Prae. Act, \u00a7 478). Inasmuch, then, as the Workmen\u2019s Compensation Board was fully authorized to do precisely what it did do, and its determination has not been appealed, plaintiff, as administratrix of this claimant, is entitled to recover from the defendant the moneys which had been previously paid to her and subsequently paid to defendant in the course of the interpleader action.</p>\n<p id=\"b454-5\">Accordingly, judgment should be affirmed, with costs.</p>\n<p id=\"b454-6\">Desmond, Fuld, Van Voorhis and Burke, JJ., concur in <em>Per Curiam </em>opinion; Froessel, J., dissents in an opinion in which Conway, Ch. J., and Dye, J., concur.</p>\n<p id=\"b454-7\">Judgment reversed, etc.</p>\n</opinion>\n</casebody>\n",
