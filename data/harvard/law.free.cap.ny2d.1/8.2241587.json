By express statute, tax proceedings in the City of New York are commenced by the service of a petition alone; elsewhere in the state they are commenced by service of a petition and notice. The phrase \u2018 \u2018 petition and notice \u2019 \u2019, a geographical limitation to exclude the City of New York, was recommended by the Judicial Council and used by the legislature in its original enactment of section 292-b and was retained without amendment in section 292-b as amended, thus unequivocally excluding <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"10\">*10</page-number>the City of New York from section 292-b as amended. Elsewhere in article 13 of the Tax Law, where both New York City proceedings and proceedings elsewhere in the state were intended to be included, the Judicial Council had recommended and the legislature had used the phrase \u201c petition or petition and notice. <em>(People ex rel. Schwarz </em>v. <em>Miller, </em>281 N. Y. 554; <em>People ex rel. Irving Trust Co. </em>v. <em>Miller, </em>264 App. Div. 270; <em>People ex rel. Empire Mtge. Co. </em>v. <em>Cantor, </em>190 App. Div. 512.) II. It was error for the courts below to speculate as to the legislative intent and to conclude, contrary to the express and unequivocal language of the statute, that the intent was to make section 292-b as amended applicable to New York City proceedings, which are commenced by petition alone, and then proceed to correct a supposed error or omission of the legislature. The phrase \u201c all proceedings \u201d in the added sentence, whose sole purpose was to make the amended law retroactive to all pending \u201c petition and notice \u201d proceedings, to wit, \u201c This section, as hereby amended, shall apply to all proceedings regardless of the date the same shall have been commenced \u2019 \u2019, was not intended to and could not conceivably further amend the amended law by any judicially discovered double meaning so as to include New York City proceedings. <em>(Meltzer </em>v. <em>Koenigsberg, </em>302 N. Y. 523; <em>People ex rel. Bingham Operating Corp. </em>v. <em>Eyrich, </em>265 App. Div. 562; <em>People ex rel. New York City Omnibus Corp. </em>v. <em>Miller, </em>282 N. Y. 5; <em>Matter of Delmar Box Co. [\u00c6tna Ins. Co.], </em>309 N. Y. 60.) III. The statute, if applicable to the City of New York, is unconstitutional. <em>(Riglander </em>v. <em>Star Co., </em>98 App. Div. 101, 181 N. Y. 531; <em>Sliosberg </em>v. <em>New York Life Ins. Co., </em>217 App. Div. 67, 244 N. Y. 482; <em>Ocorr </em>v. <em>Lynn, </em>105 Misc. 489; <em>Republic Pictures Corp. </em>v. <em>Kappler, </em>151 F. 2d 543, 327 U.

It consequently leaves no room for construction that it is inapplicable to the City of New York. Authoritative sources have uniformly concluded that the statute is applicable to all proceedings in this state. The claim of unconstitutionality is lacking in merit inasmuch as the statute merely places a reasonable time limit upon the prosecution of <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"11\">*11</page-number>tax review proceedings. <em>(People ex rel.

Y. 482.)</p>\n<opinion data-order=\"7\" data-type=\"opinion\" id=\"x999-1\" type=\"majority\">\n<author id=\"b37-4\">Fuld, J.</author>\n<p id=\"AcX\">We are called upon, in this declaratory judgment action, to say whether or not section 292-b of the Tax Law, as amended last year (L. 1955, ch. 651) \u2014under which tax assessment review proceedings more than four years old are deemed abandoned \u2014 applies to proceedings instituted in the City of New York. Plaintiff, an owner of real property in New York City, has pending four separate proceedings to review the tax assessments levied against her property by defendants, one for each year since 1951-52. The courts below, in granting defendants\u2019 motion for judgment on the pleadings, held that the statute controls plaintiff\u2019s proceedings and all others brought in the metropolitan area.</p>\n<p id=\"b37-5\">Section 292-b provides that, \u201c Unless the proceeding upon the petition and notice shall be brought to a hearing \u2019 \u2019 within four years from the date of its commencement, \u201c the proceeding thereon shall be deemed to have been abandoned \u201d. Prior to the 1955 amendment, the statute contained a clause expressly limiting its operation to proceedings in counties <em>1 </em>\u2018 having a population of less than one hundred thousand \u201d. The amendment eliminated that clause but left the remainder of the statute unchanged, except that it added a one-year saving clause for pending proceedings and a provision allowing extension of the four-year period by stipulation of the parties or court order. The following is the text of section 292-b, with the matter deleted by the 1955 amendment in brackets and the new matter in italics:</p>\n<blockquote id=\"b37-6\"><em>\u201c </em>[In a county having a population of less than one hundred thousand,] Unless the proceeding upon the petition and notice shall be brought to a hearing before the court or a justice thereof within four years from the date of the service of the petition and notice, the proceeding thereon shall he deemed <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"12\">*12</page-number>to have been abandoned and an order dismissing the petition shall be entered without notice and such order shall constitute a final adjudication of all issues raised in the proceeding, <em>except in proceedings where, within such four year period, the parties otherwise stipulate or a court or judge otherwise orders on good cause shown. This section, as hereby amended, shall apply to all proceedings regardless of the date the same shall have been commenced provided, however, that proceedings to which this section was not applicable prior to such amendment and which were commenced prior to the effective date of such amendment shall not be subject to this section if they shall be brought to hearing within one year .from the effective date of this section as hereby amended.\u201d</em></blockquote>\n<p id=\"b38-4\">The deletion of the first clause, which had restricted the statute \u2019s coverage to counties with a population of less than 100,000, had the effect of extending the reach of the provision to 15 additional counties, but not to New York City. This conclusion is compelled, we believe, by the plain language of the amended section : it refers only to \u2018\u00a3 petition and notice \u2019 \u2019 proceedings, and to no other kind. While tax review proceedings everywhere else in the state are commenced by serving a petition and notice (Tax Law, \u00a7 290-b), the separate procedure prescribed for New York City requires \u201c the service of such petition alone \u201d (Tax Law, \u00a7 290-b; Administrative Code of City of New York, \u00a7 166-1.0). This differentiation in procedure is explicitly and sharply written into section 290-b, providing as it does that a real estate tax review proceeding may be commenced</p>\n<blockquote id=\"b38-5\"><em>\u2018 \u2018 </em>by serving upon the officers designated * * * a petition, as prescribed in section two hundred ninety-c, together with a notice in writing of an application for review under this article returnable not less than twenty days nor more than ninety days after service of such petition and notice, <em>except that a proceeding to review an assessment for property in a city having a population of one million or more shall be commenced by the service of such petition alone.\u201d </em>(Emphasis supplied.)</blockquote>\n<p id=\"b38-7\">In three other sections of article 13 of the Tax Law, this distinction between New York City\u2019s \u201cpetition\u201d procedure and the procedure of <em>\u2018 \u2018 </em>petition and notice \u2019 \u2019 applicable to the rest of the state is expressly preserved. Section 291, prescribing the <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"13\">*13</page-number>mode of service on the assessing body, refers to the service V of the petition or petition and notice when such notice is required by section two hundred ninety-b 5 5; section 293 recites that failure to serve \u201c the petition or petition and notice, when such notice is required \u2019 \u2019 shall constitute a defense; section 294 (repealed, in effect, by L. 1950, ch. 654) provided for costs \u201c If the petition or petition and notice shall be dismissed \u201d. .</p>\n<p id=\"b39-4\">All these sections of the Tax Law (\u00a7\u00a7 290-b, 291, 293, 294 and the section before us, \u00a7 292-b) became law in 1949, when, following the recommendation of the Judicial Council and others, the cumbersome certiorari procedure in real estate tax review was replaced by the present petition to review (L. 1949, ch. 551). When this revision was first advanced by the Judicial Council, it envisaged a uniform state-wide procedure requiring only a petition, and the proposed four-year abandonment section, originally numbered section 292-a, likewise referred only to \u201c the petition \u201d. (See Fifteenth Annual Report of N. Y. Judicial Council, 1949, p. 344.) Before its enactment, the separate procedure was adopted requiring the institution of proceedings upon petition <em>and notice </em>everywhere except in New York City (see Sixteenth Annual Report of N. Y. Judicial Council, 1950, p. 18); and, in accordance with the new pattern, section 292-a was also changed to refer only to <em>\u201c </em>the proceeding upon the petition <em>and notice </em>\u201d, thus having application solely outside of New York City. In this form, it was enacted \u2014 being renumbered section 292-b in 1950 (L. 1950, ch. 655, \u00a7 1).</p>\n<p id=\"b39-5\">In the light of this statutory history, the words \u201c petition \u201d and \u201c petition and notice \u201d must be regarded as words of art, words of art used by the legislature in a consistent and purposeful manner. When section 292-b was originally enacted, in 1949, the legislature\u2019s provision was that a tax review proceeding would be deemed abandoned <em>\u2018 \u2018 </em>in a county having a population of less than one hundred thousand, unless the proceeding upon the petition and notice \u201d shall be brought to a hearing within four years of its institution. It was thereby made <em>doubly plain </em>that the statute was applicable only to tax jurisdictions other than New York City, by virtue of, first, the population limitation of less than 100,000, and, second, the restriction based on the nature of the proceeding. The later 1955 amendment removed the population restriction, but there still remained the words relating the provision to a \u201c proceeding upon the petition <em>and </em><page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"14\">*14</page-number><em>notice </em>\u201d. The deliberate retention of those words clearly reflects a design to leave the statute inapplicable to New York City for, had the legislature intended otherwise, it would undoubtedly have referred to the \u201c petition or petition and notice \u201d\u2014 the formula uniformly and consistently employed in those provisions of article 13 whenever application was intended for New York City as well as the rest of the state (\u00a7\u00a7 290-b, 291, 293, 294).</p>\n<p id=\"b40-4\">The effect of the amendment was, therefore, to extend the statute\u2019s coverage to all those counties with a population in excess of 100,000, <em>where the tax review proceeding is brought upon petition and notice. </em>In other words, the modified statute became applicable to every county in the state,' <em>except </em>those in which the proceeding is commenced by a petition alone, a petition without notice, that is, <em>except </em>those within New York City.</p>\n<p id=\"b40-5\">It is no answer to suggest, as defendants do, that the legislature\u2019s reference to the <em>\u20181 </em>petition and notice\u201d was mere surplusage or that its failure to specify the other type of proceeding was inadvertent. It is a cardinal principle to be observed in construing legislation that the court should neither limit nor extend its plain language and that, whenever practicable, \u201c effect must be given to all the language employed \u201d. <em>(Heerwagen </em>v. <em>Crosstown St. Ry. Co., </em>179 N. Y. 99, 105; <em>Matter of New York &amp; Brooklyn Bridge, </em>72 N. Y. 527, 530; see, also, 2 Sutherland on Statutory Construction [3d ed., 1943], \u00a7 4705, p. 339.) <em>\u201c </em>Our duty is to presume that each clause * * * has a purpose \u201d <em>(Crayton </em>v. <em>Larabee, </em>220 N. Y. 493, 501) and the only purpose that could have been served by referring to \u201c the proceeding upon the petition and notice \u201d was to exclude the \u201c petition alone \u201d proceedings of New York City.</p>\n<p id=\"b40-7\">Since it is thus made manifest, from the plain language employed, that the legislature did not mean to extend the statute to New York City proceedings, it is not necessary to consider the statement made on the floor of the Assembly by the introducer of the bill, just before its passage, that it \u201c will not apply to the City of New York.\u201d (Colloquy in Assembly on Senate Bill Pr. No. 3315, March 31, 1955; see, also, Journal of the Assembly of the State of New York, 178th Session, Yol. Ill, p. 2916.)</p>\n<p id=\"b41-2\"><page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"15\">*15</page-number>The judgment appealed from should be reversed, with costs in all courts.</p>\n<p id=\"b41-3\">Conway, Ch.
