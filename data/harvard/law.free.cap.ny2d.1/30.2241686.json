J.</author>\n<p id=\"ATb\">The defendant was sentenced as a <em>third </em>felony offender to 15-20 years in State prison and is now confined at Attica State Prison. One of the two convictions which was relied upon as the basis for his third offender sentence was for attempted grand larceny. Upon that conviction he received a sentence which we construe to be a suspended one. The question presented is whether one who has been twice convicted of a felony, but has received a suspended sentence upon one of the convictions, may be classed as a third offender under section 1941 of the Penal Law, which reads as follows:</p>\n<blockquote id=\"b57-5\">\n<em>\u201c Punishment for second or third offense of felony.</em>\n</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b57-6\"><em>\u201c </em>1. Except as provided in subdivision two of this section, a person, who, after having been once or twice convicted within this state, of a felony, of an attempt to commit a felony, or, under the laws of any other state, government, or country, of a crime which, if committed within this state, would be a felony, commits any felony, within this state, is punishable upon conviction of such second or third offense, as follows:</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b57-7\">\u201c If the second or third felony is such that, upon a first conviction, the offender would be punishable by imprisonment for any term less than his natural life, then such person must be sentenced to imprisonment for an indeterminate term, the minimum of which shall be not less than one-half of the longest term prescribed upon a first conviction, and the maximum of which shall not be longer than twice such longest term.</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b57-8\">\u201c 2. A person, who, after having been twice convicted within this state, of a felony or of an attempt to commit a felony under section seventeen hundred fifty-one of this chapter or under any other law relating to narcotic drugs, or, under the laws of any other state, government or country, of a crime under any law <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"32\">*32</page-number>relating to narcotic drugs which, if committed within this state, would be a felony, commits a felony under section seventeen hundred fifty-one of this chapter or under any other law relating to narcotic drugs, within this state, shall be sentenced upon conviction of such third offense to imprisonment in a state prison for an indeterminate term the minimum of which shall not be less than fifteen years, and the maximum thereof shall be his natural life.</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b58-4\">\u201c 3. For purposes of this section, conviction of two or more crimes charged in separate counts of one indictment or information, or in two or more indictments or informations consolidated for trial, shall be deemed to be only one conviction.\u201d</blockquote>\n<p id=\"b58-5\">Prior to 1893 provision had been made in section 688 of the Penal Code (predecessor to Penal Law, \u00a7 1941) for punishment for a second offense of felony. That section provided for additional punishment by reason of the fact that the prisoner had had a previous conviction.</p>\n<p id=\"b58-6\">Where there is a conviction but sentence has been suspended, there is no judgment for the sentence is the judgment <em>(Manke </em>v. <em>People, </em>74 N. Y. 415, 424; <em>People </em>v. <em>Bork, </em>78 N. Y. 346; <em>People </em>v. <em>Bradner, </em>107 N. Y. 1, 11; <em>People </em>v. <em>Harcq, </em>292 N. Y. 321). Therefore, if a prisoner were convicted of a felony, but sentence was suspended, he was not a second offender within the meaning of section 688 of the Penal Code (since 1909, Penal Law, \u00a7 1941). One so situated could not be indicted as a second offender and the additional punishment for a second felony offense could not be meted out to him. To obviate this there was enacted section 470b of the Code of Criminal Procedure in 1893 (L. 1893, ch. 651) which provided in subdivision 1 that: \u201c 1. For the purpose of indictment and conviction of a second offence, the plea or verdict and suspension of judgment shall be regarded as a conviction, and shall be pleaded according to the fact.\u201d</p>\n<p id=\"b58-7\">That <em>expressly </em>referred to an indictment and conviction of a <em>second </em>offense only.</p>\n<p id=\"b58-8\">In 1936, section 1941 of the Penal Law, the successor to section 688 of the Penal Code, was amended so as to expressly provide punishment for a <em>third </em>offense of felony, but no change was made in section 470-b of the Code of Criminal Procedure, as would have been done had it been intended to make 470-b of the Code applicable to a third offender. In view of the care <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"33\">*33</page-number>which the Legislature exhibited in making amendments in that year, it was clearly not an oversight.</p>\n<p id=\"b59-4\">In 1907, section 688-a of the Penal Code (now Penal Law, \u00a7 1942) was enacted so as to provide punishment for fourth conviction of a felony. Section 1942 of the Penal Law reads as follows:</p>\n<blockquote id=\"b59-5\"><footnotemark>1</footnotemark> \u2018 <em>Punishment for fourth conviction of felony.</em></blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b59-6\"><em>\u201c </em>A person who, after having been three times convicted within this state, of felonies or attempts to commit felonies, or under the law of any other state, government or country, of crimes which if committed within this state would be felonious, commits a felony, other than murder, first or second degree, or treason, within this state, shall be sentenced upon conviction of such fourth, or subsequent, offense to imprisonment in a state prison for an indeterminate term the minimum of which shall be not less than the maximum term provided for first offenders for the crime for which the individual has been convicted, but, in any event, the minimum term upon conviction for a felony as the fourth or subsequent, offense, shall be not less than fifteen years, and the maximum thereof shall be his natural life. A person so sentenced may be released on parole in the same manner and upon the same conditions as prisoners serving an indeterminate sentence in state prisons are released. A person to be punishable under this and the preceding section need not have been indicted and convicted as a previous offender in order to receive the increased punishment therein provided, but may be proceeded against as provided in the following section. For purposes of this section, conviction of two or more crimes charged in separate counts of one indictment or information, or in two or more indictments or informations consolidated for trial, shall be deemed to be only one conviction.\u201d</blockquote>\n<p id=\"b59-7\">In <em>People ex rel. Marcley </em>v. <em>Lawes </em>(254 N. Y. 249), we held that one who had received upon two prior pleas of guilty two suspended sentences, had not been \u201c convicted\u201d of those two felonies and that the provisions of section 1942 were not applicable to him. We said (pp. 253-254): \u201c We have not overlooked the fact that under section 470-b of the Code of Criminal Procedure a prisoner against whom a sentence, upon a prior plea or verdict of guilt, has been suspended, if again guilty, must be regarded as a second offender; nor that under section 517 of <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"34\">*34</page-number>the same Code an appeal lies from a conviction where sentence has been suspended. The provisions of these sections, however, are expressly limited by their terms; the former by the words \u2018 for the purpose of indictment and conviction of a <em>second </em>offense;\u2019 the latter by the words \u2018for every purpose of an appeal herein.\u2019 Thus limited they can have no application when an interpretation of section 1942 is sought.\u201d (Emphasis supplied.) The same reasoning applies here, and if that reasoning in the <em>Marcley </em>case <em>(supra) </em>is not to be rejected by us it is quite clear that the appellant here may not be sentenced as a <em>third </em>offender where there are not two prior <em>judgments </em>of guilt as to him. There cannot be two judgments since there has been as to one conviction a suspended sentence and therefore no judgment <em>(People </em>v. <em>Harcq, supra, </em>and cases cited).</p>\n<p id=\"b60-4\">The dictum of Judge Crane in <em>People </em>v. <em>Gowasky </em>(244 N. Y. 451) was general language used when the particular problem presented in the <em>Marcley </em>case was not under consideration. When it was precisely presented in <em>People ex rel. Marcley </em>v. <em>Lawes (supra), </em>Judge Crane adhered to his general language in <em>People </em>v. <em>Gowasky (supra) </em>and found his general language as to section 1941 not followed and he became one of the dissenting Judges.</p>\n<p id=\"b60-5\">It is true that the sentencing Judge could have given Shaw the same 15- to 20-year sentence whether he was to be considered a second or third felony offender but, viewed realistically, judges do not customarily impose the same sentence whether a man be a second or third felony offender. The matter should be remitted to the sentencing court so that sentence may be imposed upon the prisoner as a second felony offender. To do otherwise would depart from the reasoning in the <em>Marcley </em>case <em>(supra) </em>and, indeed, if carried to its logical conclusion, would make this prisoner a fourth offender subject to life imprisonment if, at any time during the remainder of his life, he were to commit another felony. Such reasoning, if we were to affirm here, would compel, in such event, the overruling of the <em>Marcley </em>case. Indeed an affirmance here and the writing, by what would seem to be judicial legislation, into section 470-b of the Code of Criminal Procedure of the words \u201c or third offense \u201d where the Legislature has declined to place it, might well be considered to be a departure from the modern trend in the science of penology,</p>\n<p id=\"b61-3\"><page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"35\">*35</page-number>In 1940 and 1942 (see bills introduced in the Legislature on March 22,1940 [Senate No. 2569, Int. No. 2025] and in January, 1942 [Senate No.- 392, Int. No. 366]), attempts were made to supersede and enlarge section 470-b so as to make it applicable to third and fourth offenders. Bach bill contained the same wording and explanation of purpose. Bach read as follows: <footnotemark>1</footnotemark> \u2018 \u00a7 440. <em>Effect of suspension on judgment. </em>If pronouncement or execution of sentence has been suspended, the judgment of conviction shall nevertheless constitute a conviction for all purposes. [This section supersedes and enlarges present section 470-b by providing that the judgment of conviction shall be a conviction for all purposes.] \u201d</p>\n<p id=\"b61-5\">We have quoted these bills which failed of passage in 1940 and 1942 and they were the latest designed to change section 470-b. They may not be said to have as their purpose to cover the <em>\u2018 \u2018 </em>fourth offender treated in \u00a7 1942 \u2019 \u2019 and \u2018<footnotemark>1</footnotemark> not the third offender dealt with by \u00a7 1941 \u2019 \u2019, since by their terms they were to supersede and enlarge section 470-b, so as to affect second, third and fourth offenders.</p>\n<p id=\"b61-6\">The Legislature refused in 1940 and 1942 to pass the bills. We lack the power to do by decision what the Legislature has declined to do by legislative action.</p>\n<p id=\"b61-7\">There is, of course, no claim made here by either appellant or respondent that a third offender with a suspended sentence as to a prior offense <footnotemark>1</footnotemark> \u2018 would of necessity be treated less severely than a second \u201d offender. That, of course, never occurred and could not occur since in such a case the prisoner would be a second offender under section 470-b of the Code of Criminal Procedure and the sentencing judge would be obliged to sentence him as such. What the defendant is seeking here is to be sentenced as a second offender. If his sentence as a third offender would \u2018 \u2018 of necessity \u2019 \u2019 require him to be sentenced to a term less than that of second offender, his application would not be the present one.</p>\n<p id=\"b61-8\">The order of the Appellate Division should be reversed and the case remitted to the County Court for resentencing of appellant as a second offender.</p>\n<footnote label=\"1\">\n<p id=\"b63-8\">. More specifically, following a plea of guilty to attempted grand larceny in 1925, the Onondaga County Court had ordered the \u201c sentence * * * deferred\u201d and defendant placed on probation. Contrary to defendant\u2019s contention, there was here no deferment or postponement for an indefinite or indefinable period (cf. <em>Matter of Hogan </em>v. <em>Bohan, </em>305 N. Y. 110, 112-113; <em>Matter of Richetti </em>v. <em>New York State Bd. of Parole, </em>300 N. Y. 357); in its context, \u201cdeferred\u201d meant \u201csuspended.\u201d</p>\n</footnote>\n</opinion>\n<opinion data-order=\"8\" data-type=\"opinion\" id=\"x999-2\" type=\"concurrence\">\n<author id=\"b61-9\">Van Voorhis, J.</author>\n<p id=\"AcH\">(concurring). Judge Ftjld\u2019s interpretation of these statutes, it seems to me, agrees with Chief Judge Caedozo\u2019s dissenting opinion in <em>People ex rel. Marcley </em>v. <em>Lawes </em><page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"36\">*36</page-number>(254 N. Y. 249). In holding that Marcley could not be sentenced as a fourth offender in that two of his three previous felonies had resulted in suspended sentences, the court necessarily decided that he could not have been sentenced as a third offender. In fact, he was remanded to be sentenced as a second offender pursuant to section 470-b of the Code of Criminal Procedure, as that section was interpreted by the court majority. The Legislature has not changed the ruling in <em>People ex rel. Marcley </em>v. <em>Lawes (supra), </em>although that case was decided a quarter of a century ago. The fact that the Legislature has not intervened is an indication that it has acquiesced in mitigating the severity of the Baumes Law to this extent <em>(People </em>v. <em>Charbineau, </em>115 N. Y. 433; <em>Matter of Maxson Corp. </em>v. <em>Ralph, </em>182 Misc. 144, affd. 268 App. Div. 753, affd. 294 N. Y. 880; <em>Faingnaert </em>v. <em>Moss, </em>295 N. Y. 18).</p>\n<p id=\"b62-4\">The interpretation given to section 470-b by the <em>Marcley </em>case <em>(supra) </em>has become the law of the State, and this requires that appellant be sentenced as a second rather than as a third offender. The difference is not meaningless, even though the punishment to be meted out in the discretion of the County Court may be as severe in the case of a second as in that of a third offender. I vote to reverse and remand appellant for resentence in accordance with the direction contained in the opinion by Chief Judge Conway.</p>\n</opinion>\n<opinion data-order=\"9\" data-type=\"opinion\" id=\"x999-3\" type=\"dissent\">\n<author id=\"b62-5\">Fuld, J.</author>\n<p id=\"Ar\">(dissenting). I cannot agree, for, in my view, the present decision not only misconstrues the applicable statutory provisions but directs a course most unreal. Analysis of the provisions in question establishes the first, and realization of precisely what is being decided and ordered demonstrates the second.</p>\n<p id=\"b62-6\">In 1949, defendant was convicted in the Monroe County Court, following his plea of guilty, of grand larceny in the first degree. The district attorney filed an information, as prescribed by section 1943 of the Penal Law, accusing him of \u201chaving been [previously] convicted \u2019 \u2019 of two felonies, the crimes of burglary in 1929 and attempted grand larceny in 1925. The information was read to defendant. Then, after he had admitted that he was the person charged therein, the judge, observing that he had been 1 \u2018 a consistent violator of the penal laws of this state <em>\u201d </em>for \u201c approximately 25 years \u201d and had <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"37\">*37</page-number>\u201c actually committed six felonies,\u201d sentenced him, pursuant to section 1941 of the Penal Law, as \u201c a third felony offender.\u201d The 1925 conviction listed in the information had resulted in a sentence which we all regard as a suspended sentence.<footnotemark>1</footnotemark> Contending that the court had erred in using that sentence \u201cas a basis of third offender treatment,\u201d defendant moved to vacate and set aside the 1949 judgment. The County Court and a unanimous Appellate Division found the sentence proper; this court, however, has accepted defendant\u2019s argument and is directing his resentence as a \u201c second\u201d offender, despite the indisputable fact, acknowledged by everyone, that he may be sentenced as such \u201c second \u201d offender to the precise same term of imprisonment as that imposed in 1949, namely, 15 to 20 years.</p>\n<p id=\"AZP\">Insofar as relevant, section 1941 of the Penal Law provides that a person \u2018 \u2018 who, after having been once or twice convicted * * * [within or without the state] * # * commits any felony, within this state, is punishable upon conviction of such second or third offense \u201d by imprisonment for a term not less than one half of the longest term prescribed upon a first conviction and not more than twice such longest term. And section 470-b of the Code of Criminal Procedure recites that,</p>\n<blockquote id=\"b63-6\"><em>\u201c </em>For the purpose of indictment and conviction of a second offense, the plea or verdict and suspension of sentence or suspension of execution of the whole or part of the judgment after sentence shall be regarded as a conviction, and shall be pleaded according to the fact.\u201d</blockquote>\n<p id=\"b63-7\">While there may be superficial support for the position that a suspended sentence may be deemed a conviction solely for the purpose of convicting a defendant as a \u201c second \u2019 \u2019 offender, even that support disappears when we trace the history and development of those sections from the time they first appeared on the statute books.</p>\n<p id=\"b64-3\"><page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"38\">*38</page-number>We look first to section 688 of the Penal Code \u2014 section 1941\u2019s predecessor \u2014 as it read in 1893:</p>\n<blockquote id=\"b64-4\">\u201c Second offense. A person who, after having been convicted within this state of a felony * * * commits any crime within this state, is punishable upon conviction <em>of such second offense, </em>as follows:</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b64-7\"># # #</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b64-8\"><em>\u201c2. </em>If the subsequent crime is such that, upon a first conviction, the offender would be punishable by imprisonment for any term less than his natural life, then such person must be sentenced to imprisonment for a term not less than the longest term, nor more than twice the longest term, prescribed upon a first conviction. \u2019 \u2019 (Emphasis supplied.)</blockquote>\n<p id=\"b64-9\">There was no doubt that a suspended sentence amounted to a conviction under section 688; in so many words, section 470b of the Criminal Code, as enacted in 1893, declared that a \u2018 \u2018 suspension of judgment \u2019 \u2019 was to be regarded as a conviction for \u201c the purpose of indictment and conviction of a second offence \u201d.</p>\n<p id=\"b64-10\">Section 470b was designed to implement section 688; it was to give meaning to the term \u201c conviction \u201d whenever a defendant was to be sentenced as a second offender under the latter statute. Manifestly, then, the reach of the term \u201c second offence \u201d in section 470b necessarily depended upon its content and coverage as used in section 688. That section prescribed heavier punishment for anyone convicted of crime in this state after having previously been convicted of a felony. It mattered not whether the defendant had been previously convicted of one, two or three felonies, the statute applied to all prior felony offenders equally, whether they were second, third or fourth offenders.</p>\n<p id=\"b64-11\">In other words, when it initially dealt with the subject, the legislature lumped all subsequent offenses together under the label <footnotemark>1</footnotemark> <em>\u2018 </em>second \u2019 \u2019 offense and provided similar treatment for all offenders who had previously been adjudged guilty of crime. With the passage of section 688-a in 1907 (L. 1907, ch. 645), the fourth offense was removed from the coverage of section 688, but the latter section \u2014 and it became section 1941 of the Penal Law in 1909 \u2014 continued to embrace the third, as well as the second, offender.</p>\n<p id=\"b65-3\"><page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"39\">*39</page-number>A somewhat different approach bears out the validity of this conclusion. Section 688 referred to a \u201c second \u201d offense, section 688-a, after 1907, to a \u201c fourth \u201d offense. There was no explicit mention of a \u201c third \u2019 \u2019 offense, and, unless such an offense was covered by section 688, the third offender would of necessity have been treated less severely than the second. That, of course, could not have been the case. As suggested, the answer is that the third offender was included within section 688 until 1909 and within section 1941, its successor in the Penal Law, after that year. The legislature had mandated heavier punishment for a second offender than for a first offender and, after 1907, still heavier for a fourth offender. A person, convicted after two previous offenses as a so-called \u201c third \u201d offender, was not to be treated more lightly or leniently than one only once before adjudged guilty. Indeed, our reasoning and conclusion is further borne out by the fact that in 1927 \u2014when section 1941 made no mention of \u201c third \u201d offense, but only of a \u201c second \u201d\u2014 this court expressly observed that \u201c Section 1941 provides the punishment for a second or third felony.\u201d <em>(People </em>v. <em>Gowasky, </em>244 N. Y. 451, 457, 462.)</p>\n<p id=\"b65-4\">Analysis reveals, therefore, that the legislature intended, and section 470-b provided, that in every case involving a defendant subject to the heavier punishment demanded by section 688, whether as a second or third offender, a suspended sentence was to be treated as a conviction.</p>\n<p id=\"b65-5\">To return to the history of the legislation. As already noted, section 688 of the Penal Code was replaced by section 1941 of the Penal Law in 1909 and it continued to r\u00e9ad substantially as had its forerunner (at least, in the respect we are discussing) until 1936. In that year, the legislature apparently decided to \u201c tidy up \u201d the statutory scheme. Section 1941 spoke only of a second offense; section 1942, which had replaced section 688-a, of a fourth offense. To clarify and, indeed, to state the obvious, the legislature amended section 1941 to refer expressly to those <em>\u201c </em>once or twice convicted \u201d and to a \u201c second or third \u201d offense. The amendment effected no change of substance and the legislature, by adding \u201c or third,\u201d simply made explicit what before had been implicit. (See <em>People </em>v. <em>Gowasky, supra, </em>244 N. Y. 451, 457, 462.)</p>\n<p id=\"b65-6\">A regard for precision might well have dictated an amendment of section 470-b to have its wording conform to that of <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"40\">*40</page-number>section 1941; since the words \u2018 \u2018 or third \u2019 \u2019 were imported into section 1941, it would have been in the interest of clarity had they been inserted in section 470-b. The omission may not, however, be taken as an amendment affecting the meaning, or narrowing the coverage, of section 470-b. As enacted, and as it persisted over the years, that statute complemented and implemented section 1941, relating to those same prior felony offenses \u2022\u2014\u25a0 second and third \u2014 as did section 1941.</p>\n<p id=\"b66-4\"><em>People ex rel. Marcley </em>v. <em>Lawes </em>(254 N. Y. 249), upon which the court relies, does not suggest anything different. That case concerned the treatment and punishment of <em>a fourth offender, </em>dealt with in section 1942, and the court simply decided that the legislature never intended that a suspended sentence was to be considered a conviction \u2018 \u2018 within the meaning of section 1942 \u201d (p. 253), so as to visit upon the defendant a term of imprisonment for life. It is clear, moreover, that the court did not hold, or even intimate, that a suspended sentence was not to be considered in imposing the section 1941 punishment upon a 61 third \u2019 \u2019 offender. The <em>Marcley </em>decision differentiated between section 1941, the second offender statute, and section 1942, the fourth offender provision, but there was not the slightest indication that a distinction be drawn between a second offense and a third offense, both of which were covered by section 1941. And it is highly significant that never before has any such distinction been drawn or, so far as can be ascertained, even suggested.</p>\n<p id=\"b66-5\">As defendant observes, amendments to section 470-b have been attempted over the years, but what defendant apparently fails to realize \u2014 though it is quickly revealed by a reading of the reports which accompanied the proposals \u2014 is that their purpose was to cover, not the third offender dealt with by section 1941, but the fourth offender treated in section 1942. (See, e.g., N. Y. Legis. Doc., 1929, No. 99, p. 116; N. Y. Legis. Doc., 1931, No. 114, p. 31.) Thus, the Crime Commission, the group which sponsored the bills following our decision in the <em>Marcley </em>case <em>(supra, </em>254 N. Y. 249), expressly stated that, \u201c In order to meet \u201d that holding, the statutory provisions \u201c should be clarified <em>as to the definition of conviction * * * as a basis for ascertaining ivhen a defendant becomes a fourth offender </em>\u201d, and the Commission added, \u201c It was [its] intention * * * to have the terms of the fourth offender act apply to all persons <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"41\">*41</page-number>convicted of a felony, even though sentence had been suspended in one or more cases in which an individual might be involved. \u2019 \u2019 (N. Y. Legis. Doc., 1931, No. 114, p. 31.) If, therefore, any deduction may be drawn from the fact that the legislature did not pass the proposed amendments, it is this, that it determined that a suspended sentence should not constitute a basis for fourth offender punishment.</p>\n<p id=\"b67-3\">However, quite apart from that decisive fact, the law is settled that under the circumstances here present nothing may be educed or inferred from the legislature\u2019s failure to pass the proposed bills. (See <em>Wong Yang Sung </em>v. <em>McGrath, </em>339 U. S. 33, 47; <em>Order of Conductors </em>v. <em>Swan, </em>329 U. S. 520, 529.) And this is particularly so of the bills introduced in 1940 and 1942, to which Chief Judge Conway points (opinion, p. 35); each of them (1940 Senate No. 2569, Int. No. 2025, and 1942 Senate No. 392, Int. No. 366) represented an attempt, not simply to amend section 470-b, but rather to effect a general \u201c Revision of the [entire] Code of Criminal Procedure.\u201d (Pinal Report of Commission on Administration of Justice, Legis. Doc., 1939, No. 76, p. 8 <em>et seq.) </em>Entitled \u201c To amend the code of criminal procedure, generally \u201d, the bill consisted of over 230 pages and provided for the repeal of nine titles, 44 consisting of sections one hundred forty-five to five hundred forty-nine, both inclusive \u201d and their replacement by more than 375 new or modified sections.</p>\n<p id=\"b67-4\">I advert, before concluding, to my earlier statement that the present decision is unreal. If, the court is ruling, a defendant is expressly designated a 4 4 third \u2019 \u2019 offender, the sentence will be stricken as impermissible and a resentence will be directed. But, the court acknowledges, if a defendant is charged, by the section 1943 information and by the sentencing judge, simply with 44 having been previously convicted of two felonies,\u201d and not expressly labeled a 4 4 third \u2019 \u2019 offender, the resulting heavier sentence imposed pursuant to section 1941 will be upheld as proper \u2014 although, as is perfectly manifest, the defendant has been just as effectively stamped a 44 third \u201d offender as if he had been so characterized. Consequently, even with the present holding on the books, defendant Shaw could have been, and on the ordered remission may be, sentenced to the precise same term of imprisonment as imposed in 1949, as long as the label 44 third \u201d is not employed.</p>\n<p id=\"b68-3\"><page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"42\">*42</page-number>In sum, then, section 470-b permits a suspended sentence to be counted as a conviction in punishing defendant as a \u201c third \u201d offender under section 1941 of the Penal Law. But, in any event \u2014 and whether I say, as did the Appellate Division, that the question is \u201c academic at this time \u201d (285 App. Div. 994; see, also, <em>People </em>v. <em>McCullough, </em>300 N. Y. 107)\u2014it is highly unlikely that the sentencing judge, fully apprised at the time of sentence that one of defendant\u2019s earlier adjudications had resulted in a suspended sentence, would have imposed a different sentence had he refrained from numbering defendant\u2019s offense or had he chosen to denominate him a \u201csecond\u201d or prior offender instead of a \u201c third \u201d offender.</p>\n<p id=\"b68-4\">The order of the Appellate Division should be affirmed.</p>\n<p id=\"b68-5\">Dye and Fboessbl, JJ., concur with Conway, Ch. J.; Van Voobhis, J., concurs for reversal in a separate opinion in which Conway, Ch. J., concurs; Fuld, J., dissents in an opinion in which Desmond and Burke, JJ., concur.</p>\n<p id=\"b68-6\">Order of Appellate Division reversed and case remitted to the County Court for resentencing of appellant in accordance with the opinion herein.</p>\n</opinion>\n</casebody>\n",
