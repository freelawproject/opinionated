It was proper for the court to refuse to order the witness Aurigemma to reveal his family residence. III. The admission of the prior inconsistent statement of the witness Cannizzaro for the sole purpose of impeaching his credibility was proper. <em>(People v. Ferraro, </em>293 N.

That relevant and pertinent (although negative) testimony permitted the People, under section 8-a <em>{supra), </em>to impeach the witness by showing that he had made a prior statement inconsistent with those denials <em>(People </em>v. <em>Marino, </em>288 N. Y. 411, 417). Therefore, the trial court should have admitted into evidence for impeachment purposes so much only of the statement of Cannizzaro, Sr., as controverted the three denials above listed. Putting it more specifically, it was error to let the jury see so much of the pretrial statement as contained this language: \u201c that my son had straw, but I did not know at any time where it came from it was likewise error to let the jury see the sentence of the statement beginning: \u201cWe were the only two \u201d, the sentence beginning: 11 The night he burned the hotel \u2019 \u2019, and the sentence beginning: \u201cI also declare \u2019\u2019.</p>\n<p id=\"b195-6\">The judgments should be reversed and a new trial ordered.</p>\n<p id=\"b195-7\">Conway, Ch.
