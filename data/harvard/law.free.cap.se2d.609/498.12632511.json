(RSN), was incorporated in North Carolina with three shareholders: Rickie Day (R. Day), who served as President, Beverly Gurkin (Gurkin), who served as Secretary-Treasurer, and Charlotte Day (C. Day). RSN and N. Earl Jones (Jones) are the only member-managers of River Run Investments, LLC (River Run), a limited liability company organized primarily for the purpose of buying and selling real property.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-12\">\n   Jones, an attorney, executed the Articles of Organization and Operating Agreement for River Run; these documents permitted the members to engage in other business activities even if competitive with River Run. From time to time Jones provided additional legal services to River Run, such as drafting covenants on property purchased by River Run, preparing deeds when River Run sold property, and issuing title opinions for River Run.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-13\">\n   Jones and his wife, Diane, were owners of another business, Specialty Contract Services, LLC (SCS), also formed primarily for the purchase, sale and rental of real estate to the general public. From the date SCS was formed, R. Day, the president of RSN, had averbal option to purchase a one-half interest in SCS and until May 2001, SCS was operated by Jones and R. Day as if R. Day had exercised his option. On 28 August 2001, R. Day and his wife Judy executed an agreement with Earl and Diane Jones, terminating the option and providing for a division of SCS's assets.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-14\">\n   RSN alleges in its complaint against Jones, SCS, and River Run, that through the years these parties had established a course of dealing whereby if any member purchased property or negotiated to purchase property for River Run, the property would be sold to River Run for the price negotiated or incurred by the member. However, in June 2000, Jones and R. Day met with representatives of Homes America, Inc. and negotiated the purchase of two mobile homes by SCS. Although SCS paid $19,836.35 for the mobile home with serial number 1901 and $20,461.38 for the home bearing serial number 8984, the invoice costs for the homes were $34,498.00 and $35,585.00 respectively. According to RSN's complaint, in July 2000, Jones and R. Day sold the two homes to River Run for $66,600.00, providing approximately $26,302.27 in undisclosed profit to SCS.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-15\">\n   In August 2000, the two mobile homes were delivered to lots in Coats, North Carolina owned by R. Day, C. Day and Gurkin, individually. However, the certificates of origin were never delivered due to a lawsuit filed against Jones and SCS by Homes America on 19 October 2000.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-16\">\n   According to RSN's complaint, River Run issued a check in the amount of $36,600.00 payable to Homes America as partial payment for the mobile homes, but it was never negotiated due to the lawsuit. RSN further alleges that on 7 September 2001, Jones drew a counter check on the River Run account in the amount of $36,600.00 and deposited the money into SCS's account, knowing he would be unable to provide River Run with the certificates of origin on these mobile homes. Without the certificates of origin, the mobile homes now owned by River Run could not be attached and sold as real property.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-17\">\n   Jones and River Run answered, denying the material allegations of RSN's complaint. As a third-party plaintiff, Jones alleged that R. Day, Gurkin and C. Day committed three acts of conversion. He also claimed that Gurkin and Ann Gurkin Realty, as real estate agents for River Run, breached their fiduciary duty to River Run and committed constructive fraud when they failed to close the sale on property under contract. Lastly, Jones alleged the acts by defendants R. Day, Gurkin, C. Day and Ann Gurkin Realty were unfair and deceptive trade practices.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-18\">\n   In its answer and third party complaint, SCS alleges that R. Day represented to SCS and Jones that he would assist SCS in the defense of the suit by Homes America. In exchange, Jones and his wife, Diane, entered into an agreement with R. Day and his wife Judy,\n   <em>\n    inter alia,\n   </em>\n   releasing R. Day from his option to purchase 50% of SCS and conveying to the Days a condominium at North Topsail Beach. Notwithstanding such representation and agreement by R. Day, SCS alleged that he gave testimony in the action which was contrary to the interests of SCS. Because of R. Day's actual and constructive fraud, SCS claims damages in excess of $10,000.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-19\">\n   The trial court entered an order dismissing with prejudice RSN's claims for relief against Jones for constructive fraud, breach of fiduciary duty and unfair trade practices; Jones' third-party complaints against C. Day, Gurkin and Ann Gurkin Realty; and the third party claims of SCS against R. Day and J. Day. In granting these motions to dismiss, the trial court recited that it had \"considered the affidavits and exhibits offered in support and in opposition to the motions. . . .\" Where the trial court considers matters outside the pleadings, a motion to dismiss will be treated as a motion for summary judgment pursuant to N.C. Gen. Stat. \u00a7 1A-1, Rule 56.\n   <em>\n    Ronald G. Hinson Electric, Inc. v.

Gen. Stat. \u00a7 57C-3-22(b) (2003) requires the duty of good faith in a manager of a limited liability company, N.C. Gen. Stat. \u00a7 57C-3-22(e) allows a written operating agreement to alter the manager's duty to account as trustee. The statute provides:\n  </p>\n  <blockquote id=\"p-30\">\n   Except as otherwise provided in the articles of organization or a written operating agreement, every manager must account to the limited liability company and hold as trustee for it any profit or benefit derived without the informed consent of the members by the manager from any transaction connected with the formation, conduct, or liquidation of the limited liability company or from any personal use by the manager of its property.\n  </blockquote>\n  <p id=\"p-31\">\n   N.C. Gen. Stat. \u00a7 57C-3-22(e) (2003).\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-32\">\n   Jones claims his duty to account to RSN was waived pursuant to Section 1.6 of the River Run operating agreement which provides:\n  </p>\n  <blockquote id=\"p-33\">\n   Except as expressly provided otherwise herein and subject to applicable law, unless a Member agrees otherwise with the Company, such Member may engage in any activity in addition to the business of the Company, whether or not competitive with or in conflict with the business of the Company, and shall not be required to disclose such activity to or offer any interest in any such activity to the Company or to any other Member.\n  </blockquote>\n  <p id=\"p-34\">\n   Although the statute allows an operating agreement to alter the duty of the trustee to account, a question of material fact exists as to whether the River Run operating agreement altered Jones' duty to account or simply allowed him to participate in competing businesses. By purchasing the mobile homes and selling them to River Run at a profit without disclosing the details of the transactions to RSN, Jones may have avoided his duty to account to the members. Therefore, we hold the grant of summary judgment as to plaintiff's claim for breach of fiduciary duty was error.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-35\">\n   <strong>\n    Constructive Fraud\n   </strong>\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-36\">\n   Plaintiff next assigns error to the dismissal of its claim against Jones for constructive fraud. Plaintiff asserts that Jones committed constructive fraud by (1) making a profit he did not disclose to River Run on the sale of the mobile homes, (2) taking $36,600 from River Run when he knew the certificates of origin could not be issued in exchange for the payment, and (3) by failing to disclose all material facts as required by a fiduciary. We likewise consider the trial court's order dismissing this claim as one for summary judgment. N.C. Gen. Stat. \u00a7 1A-1, Rule 56 (2003).\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-37\">\n   The elements of a constructive fraud claim are \"(1) a relationship of trust and confidence, (2) that the defendant took advantage of that position of trust in order to benefit himself, and (3) that plaintiff was, as a result, injured.\"\n   <em>\n    White v.

In its complaint, RSN alleges that the profit was not divulged to River Run and that the transaction was in \"contravention of the parties' agreements and course of dealing with one another.\" It is unclear whether R. Day was acting on behalf of RSN, River Run, or SCS during this purchase and resale and whether the other shareholders of RSN, Gurkin and C. Day, were aware the homes were being sold by SCS. RSN further alleges that at the time Jones issued the River Run check to SCS, \"he knew or should have reasonably known that he could not produce Certificates of Origin\" for the mobile homes.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-41\">\n   Jones, in his answer, denies each of these allegations. In an affidavit filed in support of his motion, Jones stated that \"[o]n 7 July 2000, Jones and Rickie Day met with Beverly Gurkin and Charlotte Day in RSN's office and all parties discussed and agreed that River Run would purchase the two mobile homes that are the subject of plaintiff's complaint for approximately $2,000.00 below each invoice price.\" Jones further asserted that it was Rickie Day who obtained $30,000.00 from River Run's account and deposited it into SCS's checking account.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-42\">\n   However, Beverly Gurkin, in her affidavit, stated, \"[i]t was never disclosed that Earl Jones' company, Specialty Contract Services, LLC would be making a profit of more than $20,000 on River Run Investments, LLC.\" She also said that Jones wrote a counter check to SCS drawn on River Run's account \"nearly one year after he knew he could not provide certificates of origin. . . .\" Additionally, Charlotte Day provided a statement in her affidavit saying, \"[n]ot only was Specialty Contract Services involvement not disclosed, Earl took $36,600 from River Run knowing he could not deliver, and has not delivered three years later, the certificates of origin.\" Clearly, when viewing the evidence in the light most favorable to the nonmoving party, a question of material fact exists as to whether Jones committed a deceptive act by taking a \"secret profit\" and allegedly writing the checks from the River Run account to SCS. The trial court erred in granting summary judgment for RSN's claim for unfair and deceptive practices.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-43\">\n   <strong>\n    III.\n   </strong>\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-44\">\n   <strong>\n    Jones' Third-party Claims against Gurkin, C. Day and Ann Gurkin Realty Conversion\n   </strong>\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-45\">\n   Jones and River Run argue the trial court erred in granting Gurkin and C. Day's motions to dismiss Jones' derivative third-party complaint for conversion. Since the trial court reviewed affidavits and exhibits, the motion to dismiss ordinarily would be reviewed as a motion for summary judgment. However, because the affidavits and exhibits did not speak to Jones' claim for conversion, it is apparent the trial court only considered the pleadings in regards to this claim. Therefore, we review Jones' claim for conversion as a motion to dismiss.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-46\">\n   \"A motion to dismiss made pursuant to G.S. 1A-1, Rule 12(b)(6) tests the legal sufficiency of the complaint.\"\n   <em>\n    Harris v.

Thus, these defendants are entitled, as a matter of law, to dismissal as Jones and River Run failed to state a claim upon which relief could be granted.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-54\">\n   <strong>\n    Breach of Fiduciary Duty\n   </strong>\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-55\">\n   Next, Jones asserts the trial court erred in dismissing his complaint against Gurkin for breach of fiduciary duty. Because both Jones and Gurkin submitted affidavits to the trial court, we treat Jones' motion to dismiss as a motion for summary judgment.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-56\">\n   Jones argues that Gurkin breached her fiduciary duty to River Run when she participated in the conversions of River Run's funds. Gurkin admits that \"a confidential relationship existed with fiduciary duties owed to one another.\" However, since we have already held that Jones failed to show that Gurkin participated in the alleged conversions, likewise we find that he is unable to show she breached her duty by participating in the alleged conversions. Summary judgment of Jones' third-party complaint for breach of fiduciary duty is affirmed.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-57\">\n   <strong>\n    Constructive Fraud\n   </strong>\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-58\">\n   In his fourth assignment of error, Jones argues the trial court erred in dismissing his claim for constructive fraud against Gurkin and Ann Gurkin Realty. He claims that as real estate agents for River Run, Gurkin and Ann Gurkin Realty owed a fiduciary duty to River Run which was breached when they failed to close the sale of River Run's Red Robin property. A claim for constructive fraud must show that plaintiff and \"defendants were in a `relation of trust and confidence . . .

Day and Ann Gurkin Realty for unfair and deceptive practices. It is clear that although the trial court considered affidavits and exhibits, only the pleadings addressed this claim. Therefore, we review the claim as a motion to dismiss.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-62\">\n   Jones alleges that Gurkin's and C. Day's participation in a conversion of River Run's funds, and Gurkin's and Ann Gurkin Realty's breach of fiduciary duty by failing to close the sale of the River Run Property are unfair and deceptive trade practices. A claim for unfair and deceptive practices requires that plaintiff show that the defendant committed an unfair or deceptive act or practice in or affecting commerce that proximately caused injury to the plaintiff.\n   <em>\n    Prince v.

R. Day, as a\n   <em>\n    de facto\n   </em>\n   partner in SCS, had a fiduciary relationship with Jones. By entering into an agreement with the Jones that provided him with cash, the condominium and the release of further financial obligations for SCS, he took advantage of the relationship to benefit himself.
