During the plea hearing, defendant stipulated to a Prior Record Level IV based on the prior convictions listed on the sentencing worksheet prepared by the State. In accordance with the terms of the plea agreement, the trial court sentenced defendant to an active prison term of 80 to 105 months, the minimum possible sentence within the applicable mitigated range.\n   <em>\n    See\n   </em>\n   N.C. Gen. Stat. \u00a7 15A-1340.17(c), (e) (2003). Defendant gave timely notice of appeal in open court.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-11\">\n   Counsel appointed to represent defendant on appeal has been unable to identify any issue with sufficient merit to support a meaningful argument for relief. He asks this Court to conduct its own review of the record for possible prejudicial error.
