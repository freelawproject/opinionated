We affirm.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-11\">\n   <strong>\n    I. Background\n   </strong>\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-12\">\n   Plaintiff met defendant, an attorney formerly licensed in North Carolina, through a mutual acquaintance in October 2000. They discussed the possibility of defendant representing plaintiff regarding tax issues. Plaintiff had failed to file federal and state tax returns over the course of several years. The parties established an attorney-client relationship and plaintiff wrote a check for $2,000.00 to defendant. Plaintiff consulted with defendant over a course of action to defend him against a potential criminal tax indictment. Defendant counseled plaintiff about possibly filing a civil action against a third party who previously advised plaintiff not to file his taxes. Plaintiff paid defendant an additional $15,000.00 to begin construction of the lawsuit. In December 2000, defendant told plaintiff that the civil action could no longer be pursued due to potential violations of the North Carolina Rules of Civil Procedure and Code of Professional Conduct. Defendant proposed another course of action, which plaintiff declined to follow. Plaintiff requested refund of the $15,000.00 fee from defendant. Defendant refused, calling the payment a \"non-refundable flat fee.\"\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-13\">\n   Plaintiff sought restitution through various channels such as fee dispute resolution, grievance proceedings, and criminal charges against defendant. Plaintiff later learned that defendant: (1) had several liens levied for her failure to pay employment taxes; (2) was a party to civil proceedings as a defendant; (3) was charged with five instances of obtaining property by false pretenses; (4) entered a guilty plea to a charge of Financial Transaction Card Fraud under\n   <extracted-citation index=\"0\" url=\"https://cite.case.law/citations/?q=N.C.%20Gen.%20Stat.%20%C2%A7%2014-113.13\">\n    N.C. Gen. Stat. \u00a7 14-113.13\n   </extracted-citation>\n   (a)(2)(d); and (5) was disbarred from the North Carolina State Bar for misappropriating money from her client trust account and failing to perfect criminal and civil proceedings for her clients.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-14\">\n   On 6 December 2002, plaintiff filed a\n   <em>\n    pro se\n   </em>\n   complaint against defendant for: (1) legal negligence; (2) legal malpractice; (3) fraud and/or constructive fraud; (4) defamation\n   <em>\n    per se\n   </em>\n   and/or libel\n   <em>\n    per se\n   </em>\n   ; (5) breach of contract and/or\n   <em>\n    quantum meruit\n   </em>\n   ; and (6) punitive damages. Defendant answered on 6 January 2003. Plaintiff submitted several affidavits and documents relating to third-party complaints against defendant. Defendant filed a Motion\n   <em>\n    in Limine\n   </em>\n   requesting that the trial court not consider plaintiff's \"extrinsic evidence\" pertaining to \"collateral issues,\" which the trial court granted on 3 July 2003. Both parties simultaneously filed motions for summary judgment. Plaintiff's motion was denied. The trial court later granted defendant's motion on 16 September 2003. Plaintiff appeals.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-15\">\n   <strong>\n    II. Issue\n   </strong>\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-16\">\n   The issue before this Court is whether the trial court erred in granting defendant's motion for summary judgment on plaintiff's six claims.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-17\">\n   <strong>\n    III. Plaintiff's Claims Against Defendant\n   </strong>\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-18\">\n   Plaintiff asserts the trial court erred in granting summary judgment in favor of defendant for the six claims filed: (1) legal negligence; (2) legal malpractice; (3) fraud and/or constructive fraud; (4) defamation\n   <em>\n    per se\n   </em>\n   and/or libel\n   <em>\n    per se\n   </em>\n   ; (5) breach of contract and/or\n   <em>\n    quantum meruit\n   </em>\n   ; and (6) punitive damages. We disagree. First, we discuss the applicable law governing each of plaintiff's claims. Second, we consider whether summary judgment was properly entered on each claim.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-19\">\n   <strong>\n    A.

The trial court provided the\n   <em>\n    pro se\n   </em>\n   plaintiff every opportunity to present evidence to defend against defendant's motion for summary judgment. The court took time to explain to plaintiff the procedure involved and what was expected of him: \"[Y]ou have the burden of proof, and you've raised certain allegations. You say she committed legal malpractice, she committed fraud, she committed constructive fraud, libel and slander. You have the burden of proving those things through some method.\" Up to that point, plaintiff had submitted affidavits from other individuals who had complained of defendant's behavior. However, the trial court had earlier ruled such \"extrinsic evidence\" based on \"collateral issues\" was inadmissible. In addition, plaintiff either failed to respond to defendant's discovery requests or answered them by \"pleading the Fifth Amendment.\" At the hearing, plaintiff did not introduce any substantial or admissible evidence to support any of his claims.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-50\">\n   Following the hearing, the trial court found that:\n  </p>\n  <blockquote id=\"p-51\">\n   4.
