The thrust of the majority's reasoning to support this holding is that because the jury found \"both aggravating factors beyond a reasonable doubt, it had no reason or occasion to consider the option of a life sentence with or without a fine mandated when the Commonwealth proves neither aggravating factor.\"\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-45\">\n   \"[I]t is materially vital to the defendant in a criminal case that the jury have a proper verdict form.\"\n   <em>\n    Atkins,\n   </em>\n   <extracted-citation case-ids=\"875232\" index=\"183\" url=\"https://cite.case.law/va/257/160/\">\n    257 Va. at 178\n   </extracted-citation>\n   ,\n   <extracted-citation index=\"184\" url=\"https://cite.case.law/citations/?q=510%20S.E.2d%20445\">\n    510 S.E.2d at 456\n   </extracted-citation>\n   . The prejudice which the majority finds lacking in the present case occurred the moment that petitioner's jury was permitted to determine whether a sentence of death or life would be imposed under circumstances we have condemned in\n   <em>\n    Atkins.\n   </em>\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-46\">\n   While it may not be reasonable to require a perfect trial in all cases, a death case is materially different from all other criminal cases. Surely, the government does not afford an accused a fair trial when his counsel is ineffective and the jury is permitted to impose a sentence of death in a situation where the verdict forms are incomplete.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-47\">\n   For these reasons, I would vacate petitioner's sentence of death and remand the case to the trial court for a new sentencing hearing.\n   <footnotemark>\n    9\n   </footnotemark>\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-48\">\n   This order shall be published in the Virginia Reports.\n  </p>\n  <footnote label=\"9.\">\n   <p id=\"p-77\">\n    Because I would conclude that petitioner was actually prejudiced by his counsel's deficient performance under the more exacting standard of\n    <em>\n     Strickland,\n    </em>\n    I express no opinion on whether the failure to provide the jury with complete verdict forms was also a \"structural error\" for which prejudice would be presumed.\n   </p>\n  </footnote>\n </opinion>\n</casebody>\n"
