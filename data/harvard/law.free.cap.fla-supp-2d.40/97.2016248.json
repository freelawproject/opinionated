We have treated the State\u2019s appeal in this cause as a petition for writ of <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"98\">*98</page-number>certiorari. We have jurisdiction to review the trial court\u2019s non-final order aforementioned pursuant to Rule 9.030(c)(2), Fla. R. App. Pro. To deny the State this avenue of relief would, in effect, deny the State any relief at all. Assuming the excluded witnesses were essential to the State\u2019s case, and that their absence would severely damage the State\u2019s case, a trial without said witnesses would guarantee an acquittal. If the State were to nolle prosequi or drop the charges there could be no review of the trial court\u2019s order. We view the action of the trial court as a departure from the essential requirements of the law and have allowed the State\u2019s appeal to be treated as a petition for writ of certiorari accordingly.</p>\n<p id=\"b120-3\">The State contends that the trial court excluded witnesses necessary to the State\u2019s case without first having conducted a proper inquiry pursuant to the guidelines set forth in <em>Richardson v State, 246 </em>So.2d 771 (Fla. 1971). We agree - albeit with great reluctance and reservation - and reserve with instructions to the trial court to conduct a full and proper <em>Richardson </em>inquiry. Said inquiry must include at a minimum a determination as to whether the State\u2019s discovery violation in this cause was inadvertent or willful, whether the violation was trivial or substantial, and most important, what effect, if any, it had upon the ability of the defendant to properly prepare for trial. The effect of alternative remedies such as continuances, etc. must be considered.</p>\n<p id=\"b120-5\">I</p>\n<p id=\"b120-6\">We all appreciate and recognize the trial court\u2019s frustration in trying to properly bring this cause to trial. We have all experienced the miraculous and unending appearances of countless numbers of witnesses who surface just prior to or even during trial. The constant volley of continuances and transfer of files within the prosecuting attorney\u2019s office from one assistant and then to another for repeated \u201ctrial preparations\u201d can bring the trial court to the end of its patience. Nevertheless, a review of the transcript of the hearing held on July 3, 1989 does not show a full and proper <em>Richardson </em>hearing. It is for that reason (and with great reservation) that we must reverse and remand this cause for further hearing before the trial court pursuant to the mandates of <em>Richardson v State, </em>246 So.2d 771 (Fla. 1971).</p>\n<p id=\"b120-7\">CARLISLE, COLBATH, JJ., concur.</p>\n</opinion>\n</casebody>\n",
