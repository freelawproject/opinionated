Such motion was denied as untimely and insufficient as a matter of law.</p>\n<p id=\"b68-17\">Rule 9.130 of the Florida Rules of Appellate Procedure precludes <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"47\">*47</page-number>this Court from hearing the appeal of this non-final order. Therefore, this Court not having jurisdiction, the appeal is dismissed and the judgment is affirmed.<footnotemark>1</footnotemark></p>\n<footnote label=\"1\">\n<p id=\"b69-4\"> We note that in this case there is no transcript of any proceedings. It is the appellant\u2019s obligation to present a record to support his position. In the event that this court had jurisdiction, the record is insufficient to mandate reversal. <em>See Wilder v </em>Altman, 179 So.2d 250 (Fla. 3d DCA 1986). <em>See Fischer v Knuck, </em>497 So.2d 240 (Fla. 1986).</p>\n</footnote>\n</opinion>\n</casebody>\n",
