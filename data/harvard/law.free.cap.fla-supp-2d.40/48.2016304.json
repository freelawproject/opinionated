The procedures at the Batmobile were video taped and the video tape was shown to the jury. Appellant contends it was error to admit the video tape before the jury because it depicts him invoking his Fifth Amendment privilege.</p>\n<p id=\"b71-5\">This Court has reviewed the video tape. The video tape shows Mitchell, an obnoxious, loud-mouthed drunk, talking almost constantly and interrupting the officers who were asking him to remain silent. The officers did not ask Mitchell any questions. Throughout Mitchell insisted that the television cameras be turned off because they violated his First Amendment rights. He insisted he was \u201cnot intoxinated\u201d (sic) and that he had been \u201cunlawfully impregnated\u201d (sic). During the course of the filing he urinated in his pants. Throughout the filming he enthusiastically exercised his First Amendment rights at the top of his voice. At one point during this drunken tirade he mentioned his Fifth Amendment rights.</p>\n<p id=\"b71-6\">Mitchell had no right to refuse to be video taped. He was required to submit to a breathalyzer test. In <em>South Dakota v Neville, </em>74 L.Ed 2d 748, it was held that a refusal to take a blood alcohol test is not protected by the privilege against self-incrimination. <em>Neville </em>held that evidence of the refusal is admissible in evidence as evidence of guilt. Had Neville wrapped his refusal in the Fifth Amendment it would, nevertheless, have been admissible.</p>\n<p id=\"b71-7\">The Fifth Amendment protects against coerced testimony only. It does not protect against conduct. Speech itself can be conduct. If the invocation of the Fifth Amendment occurs as part of a tirade, the totality of which is nothing more than conduct evincing drunkenness, it is admissible in evidence.<footnotemark>1</footnotemark></p>\n<p id=\"b71-8\">Put another way, evidence of a drunken tirade does not become inadmissible because the drunk \u201cgot lucky\u201d and mentions the Fifth Amendment.</p>\n<p id=\"b71-9\">The judgment of the trial court is affirmed.</p>\n<p id=\"b71-10\">COHEN, MILLER, JJ., concurring.</p>\n<footnote label=\"1\">\n<p id=\"b71-11\"> This situation should be distinguished from one in which an individual, for example, says \u201cI invoke my right against self-incrimination\u201d and in so doing slurs his words. While the slurring of words might provide some evidence of impairment, it is outweighed by the prejudicial elfect of the invocation of the right to remain silent.</p>\n</footnote>\n</opinion>\n</casebody>\n",
