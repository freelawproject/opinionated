Thus, in subdivision (a) stalking is defined and an alternate misdemeanor or felony punishment of up to three years in prison is prescribed. A felony sentence of up to four years under subdivision (b) of section 646.9 or five years under subdivision (c) of section 646.9 is imposed if subdivision (a) is violated at a time when a valid restraining order protecting the victim from the accused is outstanding or the accused has certain specified prior convictions. Defendant Malik Ali Muhammad was convicted by jury trial of stalking (\u00a7 646.9, subd. (a)) (hereafter section 646.9(a)) (count 1); stalking in violation of a restraining order (\u00a7 646.9, subd. (b)) (hereafter section 646.9(b)) (count 2); stalking with a prior terrorist threats conviction (\u00a7 646.9, subd. (c)(1)) (hereafter section 646.9(c)(1)) (count 3); stalking with a prior felony stalking conviction (\u00a7 646.9, subd. (c)(2)) (hereafter section 646.9(c)(2)) (count 4); and misdemeanor criminal contempt (\u00a7 166, subd. (a)(4)) (count 5).) He admitted a prior strike allegation (\u00a7\u00a7 1170.12, subds. (a)-(d), 667, subds. (b)-(i)) and was sentenced to 10 years in state prison.</p>\n<p id=\"b446-8\">On appeal, defendant contends he was erroneously convicted of counts 1, 2 and 3 because subdivisions (a), (b), (c)(1) and (2) of section 646.9 do not describe four separate offenses but describe alternate punishments for the single offense of stalking. He also contends the court committed judicial misconduct and instructional and sentencing error. In the published portion of this opinion, we conclude defendant\u2019s claim regarding his stalking convictions is correct and order the convictions on counts 1, 2 and 3 stricken. In the unpublished portion, we affirm the conviction and sentence on counts 4 and 5.</p>\n<p id=\"b447-4\"><page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"487\">*487</page-number>BACKGROUND</p>\n<p id=\"b447-5\">In September 2001, defendant and the victim, Ivory Jean Hart, began a dating relationship that she ended six or seven months later. Hart was employed as a financial center manager and served as a vice-president of Citibank (the bank).</p>\n<p id=\"b447-6\">In April 2003, defendant was convicted of stalking (\u00a7 646.9(a)) and making terrorist threats (\u00a7 422) stemming from acts<footnotemark>2</footnotemark> committed against Hart between September and October 2002. In August 2003, defendant was placed on probation and a 10-year restraining order issued against him, prohibiting his contact with Hart and her employer.</p>\n<p id=\"b447-7\">\n<em>Current Offenses</em>\n</p>\n<p id=\"b447-8\">In December 2003, Hart received over 50 hangup phone calls. On December 17, she received two calls to her cell phone from the 916 area code, and the next day received a call on her home phone from defendant\u2019s Sacramento phone number.</p>\n<p id=\"b447-9\">On January 7, 2004, defendant called the bank\u2019s ethics hotline to report that Hart had been smoking marijuana, using nonprescription sleeping pills and Vicodin and had marijuana delivered to the bank. Oh January 13, defendant again wrote to the bank regarding Hart\u2019s \u201chabitual narcotics usage and addiction.\u201d On January 16, he wrote to the bank attaching a warning to the bank\u2019s customers of Hart\u2019s habitual marijuana use and he threatened to publish the warning to bank customers on March 1. On January 22, he wrote to the bank \u201cstrongly\u201d suggesting that Hart undergo drug testing and a polygraph examination so she could \u201ccome to grips with her problem.\u201d On February 4, in response to a letter from the bank informing defendant that his allegations were untrue and would no longer be investigated, defendant wrote the bank stating he would distribute the aforementioned warning. On February 6, defendant wrote to the bank\u2019s chief executive officer (CEO) in New York regarding Hart\u2019s drug use. In late February, he was arrested and remained in custody until his release on January 13, 2005.</p>\n<p id=\"b447-10\">On May 24, 2004, defendant again wrote to the CEO attaching photos of Hart and stating he was facing imprisonment as a result of his prior attempt to provide information to the bank. On that same date, defendant was sentenced to prison for a violation of the probation imposed following his convictions for stalking and making terrorist threats in April 2003. The following day (May 25), defendant left a telephone voice mail message at the <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"488\">*488</page-number>Alameda County prosecutor\u2019s office stating that for \u201cthe rest of [his] life\u201d defendant would continue to publicize that Hart is a marijuana addict, but he would never use any violence or threats of violence.</p>\n<p id=\"b448-4\">On May 27, 2004, defendant again wrote to the bank\u2019s CEO stating that all future communications regarding Hart\u2019s criminal behavior would be sent directly to bank customers and the media. On December 7, 2004, defendant wrote to the Alameda County District Attorney\u2019s Office summarizing defendant\u2019s concerns about the judicial system and Hart\u2019s use of illegal narcotics. On the same day, defendant again wrote to the CEO stating he intended to expose any attempt by the bank to conceal evidence of Hart\u2019s criminal conduct, attaching his letter to the district attorney\u2019s office.</p>\n<p id=\"b448-5\">Defendant was an inmate at San Quentin prison from June 7, 2004, until he was paroled in January 2005. Prior to being paroled, defendant objected to the parole condition prohibiting his contact with Hart and her family, friends and employer, but nonetheless signed an agreement to his parole conditions.</p>\n<p id=\"b448-6\">Hart testified that after each of defendant\u2019s threats, she was fearful that he would follow through on them and she would lose her job. She was also fearful that he would kill her. She said she had trouble sleeping, was seeing a psychotherapist and taking antidepressant medication. A San Quentin correctional counselor testified that when Hart was informed of defendant\u2019s upcoming parole, she was \u201cextremely\u201d fearful and anxious.</p>\n<p id=\"b448-7\">\n<em>The Defense</em>\n</p>\n<p id=\"b448-8\">Defendant testified he had been an Oakland police officer, after which he went to law school. He worked as a deputy district attorney and then practiced as a defense attorney until 1999. He was eventually disbarred. Thereafter he taught at \u201cCal. State Hayward.\u201d</p>\n<p id=\"b448-9\">Defendant admitted making all the telephone calls to Hart except for the December 2002 call. He said he made the calls to Hart when he was drinking and did not intend to frighten, harm, or kill her. He said he merely intended to unleash his anger and frustration and was now ashamed and embarrassed for leaving the messages. Defendant also admitted writing the letters to the bank out of concern for Hart\u2019s drug use and because the district attorney\u2019s office would not investigate.</p>\n<p id=\"b448-10\">Defendant said after being placed on probation on August 14, 2003, he was never provided with the terms and conditions of his probation, and did not receive them until mid-September. He said his calls and letters to the district attorney\u2019s office were to clarify the difference between the protective order <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"489\">*489</page-number>issued against him and the court\u2019s minute order, and to express frustration \u201cfor the way that this entire matter had been handled.\u201d He said he objected to the parole conditions because he could not contact or sue the bank.</p>\n<p id=\"b449-5\">DISCUSSION</p>\n<p id=\"b449-6\">I. <em>Section 646.9</em></p>\n<p id=\"b449-7\">Defendant was convicted as charged in count 1 of simple stalking (\u00a7 646.9(a)), in count 2 of stalking in violation of a court order (\u00a7 646.9(b)), in count 3 of stalking with a prior conviction for making terrorist threats (\u00a7 646.9(c)(1)), and in count 4 of stalking with a prior conviction for stalking (\u00a7 646.9(c)(2)).<footnotemark>3</footnotemark> Each of the four stalking counts involved the identical course of conduct committed against Hart between December 17, 2003, and December 10, 2004. The court sentenced defendant to a five-year upper term prison sentence on count 4 that it doubled under the \u201cthree strikes\u201d law, and stayed imposition of sentence on counts 1 through 3 pursuant to section 654 <footnotemark>4</footnotemark></p>\n<p id=\"b449-8\">Section 646.9 provides, in relevant part:</p>\n<blockquote id=\"b449-9\">\u201c(a) Any person who willfully, maliciously, and repeatedly follows or willfully and maliciously harasses another person and who makes a credible threat with the intent to place that person in reasonable fear for his or her safety, or the safety of his or her immediate family is guilty of the crime of stalking, punishable by imprisonment in a county jail for not more than one year, or by a fine of not more than one thousand dollars ($1,000), or by both that fine and imprisonment, or by imprisonment in the state prison.[<footnotemark>5</footnotemark>]</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b449-10\">\u201c(b) Any person who violates subdivision (a) when there is a temporary restraining order, injunction, or any other court order in effect prohibiting the behavior described in subdivision (a) against the same party, shall be punished by imprisonment in the state prison for two, three, or four years.</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b449-11\">\u201c(c)(1) Every person who, after having been convicted of a felony under Section 273.5, 273.6, or 422, commits a violation of subdivision (a) shall be <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"490\">*490</page-number>punished by imprisonment in a county jail for not more than one year, or by a fine of not more than one thousand dollars ($1,000), or by both that fine and imprisonment, or by imprisonment in the state prison for two, three, or five years.</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b450-4\">\u201c(2) Every person who, after having been convicted of a felony under subdivision (a), commits a violation of this section shall be punished by imprisonment in the state prison for two, three, or five years. [][] . . . [f]</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b450-5\">\u201c(e) For the purposes of this section, \u2018harasses\u2019 means engages in a knowing and willful course of conduct directed at a specific person that seriously alarms, annoys, torments, or terrorizes the person, and that serves no legitimate purpose.</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b450-6\">\u201c(f) For the purposes of this section, \u2018course of conduct\u2019 means two or more acts occurring over a period of time, however short, evidencing a continuity of purpose. . . .\u201d</blockquote>\n<p id=\"b450-7\">The heart of the parties\u2019 dispute focuses on whether subdivisions (a), (b), and (c)(1) and (2) of section 646.9 define separate substantive offenses, each with its own distinct elements. Defendant argues they do not and, instead, merely define the one substantive offense of stalking, with enhancements or alternative punishments for that offense. Thus, he argues his convictions on counts 1 through 3 must be vacated.<footnotemark>6</footnotemark> The People respond that these subdivisions describe separate substantive offenses, and, for this reason, section 954 permits multiple convictions. Section 954 provides, in relevant part: \u201cAn accusatory pleading may charge two or more different offenses connected together in their commission, or different statements of the same offense . . . under separate counts .... The prosecution is not required to elect between the different offenses or counts set forth in the accusatory pleading, but the defendant may be convicted of any number of the <em>offenses </em>charged . . . .\u201d (Italics added.) Thus multiple charges and multiple convictions can be based on a single criminal act, if the charges allege separate offenses. <em>(People </em>v. <em>Ryan </em>(2006) 138 Cal.App.4th 360, 368 [41 Cal.Rptr.3d 277].)</p>\n<p id=\"b450-8\">In resolving this dispute, we find <em>People v. Kelley </em>(1997) 52 Cal.App.4th 568 [60 Cal.Rptr.2d 653] instructive. In <em>Kelley, </em>the defendant, who previously had been prosecuted and convicted of misdemeanor contempt (\u00a7 166, subd. (a)(4)) for violating a restraining order, was charged with stalking in <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"491\">*491</page-number>violation of the same restraining order under section 646.9(b). <em>(Kelley, </em>at pp. 574-575.) As <em>Kelley </em>explained, the double jeopardy clause of the Fifth Amendment prohibits a person from being prosecuted twice for the same offense or any included offense, and the test is whether each offense contains an element the other does not. (Kelley, at p. 576.) The defendant argued that his prosecution for stalking violated the prohibition against double jeopardy because the crime of stalking in violation of a restraining order contains all the elements of the crime of contempt for violating that restraining order. <em>{Ibid.) </em>In rejecting the argument, the court stated, \u201cIn making this argument, [the defendant] incorrectly assumes section 646.9 defines the crime of stalking in violation of a restraining order. The section merely defines stalking. The provisions relating to the violation of a restraining order do not define a crime. They merely create a punishment enhancement. As such, they are not to be considered in the double jeopardy analysis. [Citation.] Absent these provisions, the crimes are distinct and the constitutional prohibition against double jeopardy was not violated.\u201d <em>(Kelley, </em>at p. 576, fn. omitted; see <em>People </em>v. <em>Markley, supra, </em>138 Cal.App.4th at p. 244 [\u00a7 646.9(c)(2) provides an <em>\u201calternative </em>sentencing scheme\u201d if the defendant has suffered a previous stalking conviction]; <em>People v. McClelland </em>(1996) 42 Cal.App.4th 144, 152 [49 Cal.Rptr.2d 587] [\u00a7 646.9(b) serves the legislative purpose of providing \u201cenhanced punishment to those stalkers who have been ordered to refrain from such conduct in civil proceedings, and, hence, have been warned that their behavior is unacceptable\u201d].)</p>\n<p id=\"b451-5\">The People assert <em>Kelley </em>is \u201cwrong\u201d and that the court failed to explain its conclusion that section 646.9(b) does not define a crime. Relying on the recent Supreme Court decision in <em>People v. Corpuz </em>(2006) 38 Cal.4th 994 [44 Cal.Rptr.3d 360, 135 P.3d 995], they argue that subdivisions (a), (b) and (c) of section 646.9 define different offenses because each has an element different from the other. However, <em>Corpuz </em>considered only whether a particular \u201cstay away\u201d order imposed as a condition of probation fell within the \u201cany other court order\u201d language of section 646.9(b), and held that it did. <em>(Corpuz, </em>at pp. 997, 1000.) At the outset of its discussion, <em>Corpuz </em>cited the language of section 646.9(a) and (b) and stated that section 646.9(a) \u201cdescribes a \u2018wobbler,\u2019 offense\u201d and section 646.9(b) \u201cdescribes a straight felony offense.\u201d <em>{Corpuz, </em>at p. 997.) The People rely on this statement as if it were a holding by our Supreme Court that subdivisions (a) and (b) of section 646.9 describe \u201cdifferent crimes.\u201d But that question was not raised in <em>Corpuz, </em>much less resolved by that decision; the People\u2019s reliance on <em>Corpuz </em>for that proposition is misplaced. <em>(People v.

(See <em>People v.

In this case, defendant committed the crime of stalking against Hart when a temporary restraining order was in effect protecting her, after having been previously convicted of making terrorist threats (\u00a7 422), and after he had been previously convicted of felony stalking. Thus, at the time defendant committed the <em>single offense </em>of stalking, his history of misconduct satisfied three separate penalty provisions, each of which required that he be subject to a greater punishment than imposed in section 646.9(a). (\u00a7 646.9(b), (c)(1), (2).) Though the single stalking offense was charged in four separate counts, defendant could be convicted of only one count of stalking. Consequently, three of defendant\u2019s four stalking convictions must be vacated. (See <em>People v. Ryan, supra, </em>138 Cal.App.4th at p. 371.) As asserted by defendant, since the court selected the count 4 conviction under subdivision (c)(2) of section 646.9 as the principal term, it is appropriate to affirm that conviction and vacate his convictions on counts 1 through 3, which involved subdivisions (a), (b) and (c)(1) of that section.<footnotemark>10</footnotemark></p>\n<p id=\"b454-5\">II.-IV.<footnotemark>*</footnotemark></p>\n<p id=\"b455-4\"><page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"495\">*495</page-number>DISPOSITION</p>\n<p id=\"b455-5\">The convictions on counts 1 through 3 and the sentence imposed thereon are vacated.
