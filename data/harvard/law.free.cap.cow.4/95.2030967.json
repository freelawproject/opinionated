This the Attorney General declined receiving, unless the defendant would consent that he should amend by adding a new count to the information. This being declined, the Attorney General treated the amended plea as a nullity ; and on the ground that it was irregular to take a rule to amend, of course, entered the defendant\u2019s default for want of a joinder in demurrer; and the cause now came before the Court on cross motions.</summary>\n<attorneys data-order=\"3\" data-type=\"attorneys\" id=\"b91-25\"><em>Talcott, </em>(Attorney General,) moved for judgment <em>of ouster, </em>against the defendant.</attorneys>\n<attorneys data-order=\"4\" data-type=\"attorneys\" id=\"b91-26\"><em>S. Stevens, </em>for the defendant, moved to set aside the default for irregularity, on the ground that the defendant had <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"96\">*96</page-number>regularly amended his plea ; and the Attorney Genera should have answered it.</attorneys>\n<attorneys data-order=\"5\" data-type=\"attorneys\" id=\"b92-7\">The Attorney General denied that the amendment was regular ; and insisted that the general rule of the Court, as to amending of course, did not apply.</attorneys>\n<attorneys data-order=\"6\" data-type=\"attorneys\" id=\"b92-8\"><em>A. Hascall, </em>said that if the defendant\u2019s attorney had mistaken the practice, he had been led into the mistake by the Attorney General, who had entered a rule, of course, to join in demurrer.</attorneys>\n<p data-order=\"7\" data-type=\"legal\" id=\"Acd\">He thought the general \"rule for amending equally applicable with the one for pleading. At any rate, the Attorney General should not have treated the rule to amend as a nullity. He should have moved to set i&gt; aside. The defendant may, at least, come in on terms.</p>\n<attorneys data-order=\"8\" data-type=\"attorneys\" id=\"b92-9\"><em>The Attorney General </em>said there was no affidavit of merits.</attorneys>\n<p data-order=\"9\" data-type=\"legal\" id=\"Atu\">But he did not wish the defendant to b.e precluded from making a defence, if he had any. All he desired was, that the people should have leave to amend, as he had proposed they should do by consent; and that the defendant ', should then be heard. Accordingly, if the Court should think the defendant ought to be let in, he wished to be understoods moving for leave to add another count to the information,</p>\n<opinion data-order=\"10\" data-type=\"opinion\" id=\"x999-1\" type=\"majority\">\n<author id=\"b92-11\">\n<em>Curia.</em>\n</author>\n<p id=\"AD-\">We see no reason why' the parties should not proceed according to the general rules and practice of the Court as to pleading, amending, &lt;fcc. We are referred to no case which is against this. The Attorney General entered a common rule to join in demurrer, and we \"think rightly ; and that the defendant was right in entering his common rule to amend. The Attorney General may take the rule which he asks, and proceed against the defendant upon an amended information. The defendant may plead to this <em>de novo.</em></p>\n<p id=\"b92-12\">Rule accordingly.</p>\n<p id=\"b92-13\">Note. The Attorney General mentioned to the Court the case of <em>The King </em>v. Glemmon, in <em>2 </em>Rolle\u2019s Rep. 41, where it was held that the defendant could not change his plea without the consent of the King\u2019s attorney, if a term had <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"97\">*97</page-number>arrived since the plea was put in; though the King had altered the pleadings on his part; But,</p>\n<p id=\"b93-4\"><em>The Court </em>said they never should hold a defendant to all the strictness of that case.</p>\n</opinion>\n</casebody>\n",
