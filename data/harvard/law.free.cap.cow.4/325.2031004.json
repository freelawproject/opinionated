Murphy also declared by this instrument -that Van Hoesen, \u201c is to have possession of the above premises on the 1st day of May next.\u201d The instrument then provided for paying the consideration money by instalments.</summary>\n<summary data-order=\"9\" data-type=\"summary\" id=\"b322-8\">Jacob Van Hoesen took possession accordingly, and continued in possession till about 1815, when he died, leaving the defendant his heir at law, who continued in possession to the time of the trial.</summary>\n<summary data-order=\"10\" data-type=\"summary\" id=\"b322-9\">The instrument in writing, executed by John Murphy and Jacob Van Hoesen, was left with one F.

It, therefore, passed no interest. (4 Cruise\u2019s Dig. <em>Deed, </em>ch. 38, s. 34, p. 428, 429. <em>Blandford </em>v. <em>Marlborough, </em>per Ld. Chancellor, 2 Atk. 545. <em>Jackson </em>v. <em>Kisselbrack, </em>10 John. Rep. 336, 337. <em>Roe </em>v. <em>Asburner, </em>5 T. R. 163, 167. <em>Doe </em>v. Smith, per Ld.

Then the death of the bargainee terminates the estate. (Co. Litt. 42, <em>a. </em>Id. s. 283. Id. 183, <em>a. b.)</em></p>\n<attorneys data-order=\"15\" data-type=\"attorneys\" id=\"b323-4\"><em>J. Sudam, </em>for the defendant.</attorneys>\n<p data-order=\"16\" data-type=\"legal\" id=\"Ac6\">The instrument of the 28th of April, 1800, contains apt v. ords of conveyance, \u201c has bargained and sold,\u201d and operates as an assignment or conveyance of the premises. <em>(Jackson </em>v. <em>Kisselbrack, </em>10 John. Rep. 336, and the cases there cited.) Where the estate intended to be passed by a conveyance is not mentioned, it is deemed to pass an estate for the life of the grantee, if the grantor has power to sell such an estate. (1 Cruise\u2019s Dig. <em>Estate for </em>life, s. 4, 5, p. 60, 61. Co. Litt. 42, <em>a. </em>sec. 56.) Murphy, having only a life estate in the premises could not convey for the life of his grantee ; and the law will so construe the conveyance as to have it pass the es-. tate which he had in the premises. (Co. Litt. 42, <em>a. </em>Id. sec. 283. Wood\u2019s Inst. 128-9, 269.) The Court will also be guided by the acts of the parties, the -long possession, the payment of rent, and the change of the tenant\u2019s name in the rent roll. There is no doubt, from the context, but that Murphy intended to divest himself of all his interest. The authorities relied on against this, are where a question might arise between the tenant and the reversioner upon, the effect of a common law conveyance. INo such question can arise upon conveyances which take effect upon the statute of uses.</p>\n<opinion data-order=\"17\" data-type=\"opinion\" id=\"x999-1\" type=\"majority\">\n<p id=\"b323-5\"><em>Curia, </em>per</p>\n<author id=\"ACle\">Savage, Ch. J.</author>\n<p id=\"AYK\">The questions arising in this case are,</p>\n<p id=\"b323-6\">1. Was the article an agreement for a lease, or was it a lease in itself?</p>\n<p id=\"b323-7\">2. If it was an instrument conveying a present interest, what estate passed by it ?</p>\n<p id=\"b323-8\">As to the first question, it is if necessary to examine the numerous cases to be found on the subject. They are many of them cited in <em>Jackson </em>v. <em>Kisselbrack, </em>(10 John. 337,) which I consider decisive of this question. In that <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"328\">*328</page-number>case a memorandum of an agreement was made, by which the grantor <em>\u201cset and to farm </em>let\u201d to the defendant certain premises; and the agreement contained a covenant that they should be surveyed, and <em>then the defendant was to take a lease. </em>The late Chief Justice, in giving the opinion of the Court, says that the last circumstance has generally given a character to the instrument of an agreement for a lease as contradistinguished from a present demise. He adds, that none of the cases contradict the position, that .where there are apt words of present demise, and to them are superadded a covenant for a further lease, the instrument is to be considered a lease, and the covenant as operating in the nature of a covenant for further assurance. This case is much stronger. Here are apt words of conveyance. The contract seems to be complete, and no provision is made for any further conveyance. If the assertion be true, \u201c that there is no case of a present demise by apt words followed by a possession, in which the instrument has not been held to pass an immediate interest,\u201d (per Spencer, J. id. 338,) then certainly an immediate interest passed by the instrument under consideration.</p>\n<p id=\"b324-8\">John Murphy had an estate for the lives of himself and wife, and though the case is silent on the subject, I presume the wife is still living. The plaintiff, then, is entitled to recover, unless John Murphy conveyed away his whole estate. What estate did he convey ? Every tenant for life has the power of alienating his whole estate, or of creating any estate less than his own, unless restrained by condition. If he seeks to crfeate a greater estate, the effort must necessarily be void for the excess, as no one can give what he has not. (1 Cruise\u2019s Dig. <em>Estate for Life, </em>sect. 95.)</p>\n<p id=\"b324-9\">If lands are conveyed to a natural person without any words of limitation whatever, he will take an estate for his own life, unless the grantor be only tenant for his own life; in which case the grantee will take an estate for the life of the grantor only. (4 Cruise\u2019s Dig. <em>Deed, </em>ch. 24, s. 42.) But if a tenant for years conveys without limitation, his whole estate passes. <em>(Fenton v. Forster, </em>Dyer, 307, <em>b. </em>And vid. 2 Bac. Abr. <em>Estate for life and occupancy, </em>(A) p. 559.) <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"329\">*329</page-number>Lord Coke (Co. Litt. 42, <em>a. </em>and 183, <em>a.) </em>gives as a reason, the maxim, in law, that every man\u2019s grant shall he taken by construction of law most forcibly against himself; and is so to be understood that no wrong be thereby done; for it is another maxim in law, <em>quod legis constructio non facit injuriam. </em>And, therefore, if tenant for life make a lease generally, this shall be taken an estate for his own life that made the lease; for if it should be a lease for the life of the lessee, it would be a wrong to him in reversion.</p>\n<p id=\"b325-4\">The law will intend the lease to be such an one as he may lawfully make, rather than that an injury may accrue to any one. (Co. Litt. 42, <em>b.)</em></p>\n<p id=\"b325-5\">Whether, therefore, the estate conveyed be for the life of the lessor or lessee, as both are dead, it is at an end; and as the lease to John Murphy has not expired, the plaintiff is entitled to recover. I have taken no notice of the fact of Murphy\u2019s name being stricken from the landlord\u2019s rent book, as that only shows the opinion of his agent; nor of the unexecuted lease, as that was not prepared by the direction of the defendant.</p>\n<p id=\"b325-6\">Judgment for the plaintiff.</p>\n</opinion>\n</casebody>\n",
