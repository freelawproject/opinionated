Judge,</summary>\n<summary data-order=\"4\" data-type=\"summary\" id=\"Axn\">It was admitted, at the trial, that the lessors of the plaintiff owned the northeast section, and the defendant the southeast section, and the only question was as to the true jjne between them. It was admitted that both parties <em>\u00a3 </em>claimed title by deed of conveyance from John W. Watkins, the patentee, to which was annexed an original or printed map of the purchase. In 1791, Lawrence Vrooman ' . was employed by the surveyor-general, to run out the tract int0 townships and quarter townships. He employed three assistants, giving them directions how to run. They did not, however, comply with these directions; but the, map was made out upon the supposition that they had run cor- , .A, . <em>J </em>, rectly. This produced a difference between the map and surve7 <em>i </em>but extensive practical locations in the patent were made in disregard of the map, and according to the. survey. The patent to Watkins, was dated June 25th, 1794. The question was, which should prevail, the map or survey; if the former, the plaintiff was entitled to recover j if the latter, the defendant. The premises in question were actually occupied from 15 to 17 years under the survey. A number of witnesses were examined upon the the question, whether the lessors of the plaintiff had acqui- \u2018 <em>. </em>esced in the survey.</summary>\n<summary data-order=\"5\" data-type=\"summary\" id=\"A99A\">After the regular examination of witnesses was through; and while the defendant\u2019s counsel was summing up to the jury, the plaintiff\u2019s counsel offered further evidence upon the question of acquiescence, which the Judge refused to receive, on the ground that it was too late.</summary>\n<summary data-order=\"6\" data-type=\"summary\" id=\"b446-22\">The Judge charged in favor of the survey and against the map line <em>; </em>and the jury found a verdict for the defend ant.</summary>\n<attorneys data-order=\"7\" data-type=\"attorneys\" id=\"b447-12\"><page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"451\">*451</page-number><em>J.

J.</author>\n<p id=\"AWFP\">(who delivered their opinion,) after stating the facts, adverted to, and relied on <em>Jackson </em>v. <em>Freer, </em>(17 John. Rep. 31.) He said, the question there, as stated by Spencer, Ch. J. was, \u201c Which shall prevail, the actual location of the lots on the ground, by marking and numbering trees at the corners, and by marking the lines of the lots, or the courses and distances which the map represents the lots as entitled to <em>1\u201d </em>The Court decided in favor of the actual location. The survey was considered as the act of the parties, though made by the agent of the surveyor-general, as in this case. In <em>Jackson </em>v. <em>Ogden, </em>(7 John. Rep. 241,) it was said, that when the map and survey do not agree, a practical location, acquiesced in, is entitled to great weight.</p>\n<p id=\"b447-11\">In this case, the evidence of acquiescence m the location by the lessors of the plaintiff, was not very conclusive; and further testimony on that subject might, have been satisfactory. Such was offered after the counsel had commenced summing up, but rejected. It was doubtless, discretionary with the Judge, to receive or reject it; and I cannot say that his discretion was not properly exercised. From the case as it stands, I think a new trial should be refused.</p>\n<p id=\"b447-14\">New trial denied.</p>\n</opinion>\n</casebody>\n",
