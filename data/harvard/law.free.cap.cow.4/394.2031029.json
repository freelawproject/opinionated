That to the 1st count, the defendant pleaded the general issue, and to the 2d and 3d, the statute of limitations; and that without replying to this last plea, the plaintiff noticed the cause for trial, and tried it upon the <em>nisi priiis </em>record, containing no plea except the general issue; but the defendant appeared by his counsel at the trial, and with the plaintiff\u2019s consent, insisted upon, and had the full benefit of the statute of limitations in his defence, as if an issue had been joined upon the plea.

He had sustained no injury. At any rate, the Court would allow the plaintiff to amend, by filing a replication <em>nunc pro tunc, </em>and amending the <em>nisiprius </em>record accordingly.

There, to debt on judgment, the defendant pleaded three pleas to the whole action; the plaintiff omitted to reply to the second which required a replication, being special. The cause was tried and a verdict found for the plaintiff on all the pleas ; but because there was no issue on the second, the defendant moved in arrest of judgment. The merits of the second plea having been tried, the court permitted the plaintiff to amend by filing a replication, and would not allow a new trial. And see 2 Saund. 319, note (6) by Sergt. Williams ; and <em>Grundy </em>v <em>Mell, </em>4 B. &amp; P. 28, often cited as 1 New Reports. The principal case seems to be within the statute of amendments and jeofails. (1 R.
