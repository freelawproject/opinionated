To this the defendant assented, and paid' the ground rent, which was $6 <em>25'per annum,'up to'the </em>1st day of May, 1822. This he did on the '22d day of June, 1822'. But oil the'26th October, 1820, the plaintiff gave notice to the defendant and his' wife to quit the premises, , . A <em>7 </em>within three months from that time; and now, on ptoof that the premises were in fact wdrth from' $ 100 to f 140 <em>per </em>annum, claimed a rent' accordingly, for the time subsequent' to the expiration of the notice; and to this effect the Judge charged the jury, holding the notice to quit td \"be sufficient.

Cushman, </em>for the defendant, moved for a new trial.</attorneys>\n<p data-order=\"7\" data-type=\"legal\" id=\"A6bP\">He said the defendant was a tenant from year to year and entitled to 6 months notice to quit. The defendant\u2019s wife possessed more than a year, before the notice to quit was given. Then the rule is-plain. A tenant from yea<em>r </em>to year is entitled to 6 months notice, ending at the commeneement of the current year; (Woodf. L. &amp; T. 182. Esp. Rep. 39.) The moment the second year begins, the tenant has a right to hold to its end. (1 T. R. 163.) Holding for an indefinite period, should be construed a tenancy from year to year, (1 John. Rep. 325-6,) which cannot he vacated without a half year\u2019s notice. (3 Burr, 1609. 1 T. R. 159. 3 Wils. 25;) If a tenant possess as a <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"350\">*350</page-number>mere occupant, with the plaintiff\u2019s license, he is entitled to notice. (1 John.

Wilson, Jun. </em>contra.</attorneys>\n<p data-order=\"14\" data-type=\"legal\" id=\"Arg\">The defendant was a tenant at will, (2 Bl. Com. 146, and authorities there cited ; 1 R. L. 78;) and the notice to quit was a legal determination of the estate, (2 Bl. Com. 146, and the authorities there cited; <em>Phillips </em>v. <em>Covert, 7 </em>John. Rep. 1, 5 ;). after which, the tenant holding over was bound to pay the real annual value of the premises. <em>(Abeel </em>v. <em>Radcliff, </em>15 John. Rep. 505.) Courts incline to turn tenancies at will into tenancies from year to year, merely for the purpose of a notice to quit, to enable the party to bring an ejectment. For every Other purpose, they retain their true character of tenancies at will. <em>(Phillips </em>v. <em>Covert, 7 </em>John. Rep. 4, per <em>Kent, </em>Ch. J.</p>\n<opinion data-order=\"15\" data-type=\"opinion\" id=\"x999-1\" type=\"majority\">\n<p id=\"b346-11\"><em>Curia, </em>per</p>\n<author id=\"AbEM\">Woodworth, J.</author>\n<p id=\"AQl\">The notice to quit terminated the tenancy at will; and converted it into a tenancy from year to year. A tenancy at-will is held to be a ten ancy from year to year, merely for the sake of a notice to quit; and the landlord cannot recover possession without giving six months notice; but this notice is not necessary for any other purpose. <em>(Phillips </em>v. <em>Covert, 7 </em>John. Rep. 4, 5.) The question then is, on what terms shall the defendant be considered as holding; after the tenancy at will ceased. Though he could 'not be ousted on such a notice, yet he must be considered as holding over; for his interest was at an end. The rule seems to be, in such cases, that where there is no new stipulation, an implication arises of a tacit consent on both sides, that the tenant shall hold from year to year at the former rent. <em>(Doe </em>v. <em>Bell, </em>5 T. R. 472, per Ld. Kenyon, Ch. J. <em>Abeel </em>v. <em>Radcliff, </em>15 John. Rep. 505.) This manner of terminating a tenancy at will is of but little <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"351\">*351</page-number>use; for it leaves the landlord, as to the rent, in the same situation as before, and imposes the necessity of \u00e1 six months notice to quit on the day of the year corresponding to that on which the first notice expires. Without this, the landlord would still be unable to sustain an ejectment. <em>(Doe </em>v. Bell, 5 T. R. 471.) With this consequence, however, we have nothing to do.</p>\n<p id=\"b347-5\">What then was the former rent ? Although the plaintiff was not, in fact, to receive any thing, yet the defendant was to pay the ground rent to the landlord paramount, namely, 6 dollars 25 cents, this being all that was exacted for lot and building. This was virtually so much rent to be paid to the plaintiff, who owed it to Vanderheyden. I do not perceive on what principle the plaintiff can claim more. The case is not like that of <em>Abeel </em>v. <em>Radcliff, </em>(15 John. Rep. 507.) There the first rent was for the lot merely. <em>Afterwards </em>buildings were erected; and the Court held that the annual value of both land and buildings was the proper-measure of damages. Here the rent of 6 dollars 25 cents was for the whole. There must be a new trial, with costs to abide the event.</p>\n<p id=\"b347-10\">New trial granted.</p>\n</opinion>\n</casebody>\n",
