T. B. Van Vechten was attorney for Bradt; and these costs were due and unpaid to Mr. Van Vechten; that this was known to Koon when he took an assignment of Lawrence\u2019s judgment.

That an attorney has a lien upon the costs nominally due to his client, but really to the attorney, which lien the Court will protect to the same extent as if the right was acquired by assignment, he cited <em>Martin </em>v. <em>Hawks, </em>(15 John. Rep. 405.)
