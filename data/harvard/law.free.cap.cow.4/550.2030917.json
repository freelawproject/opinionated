These cases were fully considered and adopted in <em>Ketchum </em>v. <em>Ketchum, </em>(4 Cowen\u2019s Rep. 87.) The only case against them is <em>Eaves </em>v. <em>Mocato, </em>(1 Salk. 314;) but this has never been acted upon; and there is reason to believe, from the mention of it in <em>Jenkins </em>v. <em>Plume, </em>(id. 207,) that it was wrongly reported; being an action on an <em>insimul computassent; </em>and not, as mentioned in the report, for money had and received. The motion must be granted.</p>\n<p id=\"b547-15\">Motion granted.</p>\n</opinion>\n</casebody>\n",
