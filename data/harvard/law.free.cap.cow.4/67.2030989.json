The judgment was by default for want of a plea. This suit was an attachment against the defendant for not returning the <em>Ji. fa. </em>and it being agreed that the costs upon the attachment must follow at the same rate with those in the original cause, it was submitted upon this ground. (Tid. <em>The People </em>v. <em>Chapman, Sheriff of Seneca, </em>1 Cowen\u2019s Rep. 214.)</summary>\n<attorneys data-order=\"2\" data-type=\"attorneys\" id=\"b63-9\"><em>M. Hoffman, </em>for the defendant, relied on the words of the act concerning costs, (1 L. R. 344, s. 4,) and insisted that 6 cents nominal damages, for the detention of the debt, can not be regarded.</attorneys>\n<attorneys data-order=\"3\" data-type=\"attorneys\" id=\"b63-10\"><em>P. Gansevoort, </em>contra, cited <em>Clapp </em>v. <em>Reynolds, </em>(2 John.

To show that nominal damages were allowable, he cited Caines\u2019 Practical Forms, 215, s. 10.</p>\n<opinion data-order=\"8\" data-type=\"opinion\" id=\"x999-1\" type=\"majority\">\n<author id=\"b64-5\">Curia.</author>\n<p id=\"AKD\">No nominal damages are given in a judgment by default in debt.<footnotemark>(a)</footnotemark> The judgment consists of the debt and costs\u2014nothing more. The costs must be taxed at the Common Pleas rate.</p>\n<p id=\"b64-6\">Rule accordingly.</p>\n<footnote label=\"(a)\">\n<p id=\"b64-7\"><em> </em>And so are the entries in Lil. Ent. 473, 483, 503. Tidd. Pr. Forms, 169-70, on <em>mutuutus. </em>So of debt on bond. (Id.)

Cas. 409,) was probably the case of a verdict; and what is said by Buller, J. in <em>Lord Lonsdale </em>v. <em>Church, </em>(2 T. R. 398,) and by Lord Kenyon, Ch. J. in <em>Wilde </em>v. <em>Clarkson, </em>(6 T. R. 304,) of nominal damages, must also be understood in reference to a recovery by verdict.</p>\n</footnote>\n</opinion>\n</casebody>\n",
