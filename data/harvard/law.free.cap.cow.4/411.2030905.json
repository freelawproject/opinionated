On Tuesday evening, the 19th of April, the plaintiffs in the second cause obtained an attachment against the goods of the defendant, from a Justice of Ulster, under which, early on Wednesday morning, the 20th, a constable levied on, and took into his custody, the defendant\u2019s goods, <em>the fi.fa. </em>not yet being levied; but, on the same day, the sheriff went to the defendant\u2019s dwelling house and levied on all the goods to be found.</summary>\n<summary data-order=\"2\" data-type=\"summary\" id=\"b407-8\">And the question was, which process should take preference.</summary>\n<summary data-order=\"3\" data-type=\"summary\" id=\"b407-9\">By agreement of the parties, the sheriff had sold all the defendant\u2019s goods; and they now requested this Court to direct the disposition of the money in his hands.
