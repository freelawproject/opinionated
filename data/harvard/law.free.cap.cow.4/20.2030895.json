The cases mentioned are necessary steps in the ordinary course of the cause. Here was a motion improperly made. It was, to be sure, denied without costs; probably under some peculiar circumstances in the case, by which our discretion as to costs was guided. These, however, were finally disposed of upon the motion. As to this,</p>\n<p id=\"b17-5\">Re-taxation ordered.</p>\n<p id=\"b17-6\"><em>M. Brainard, </em>for the motion.</p>\n<p id=\"AHH\"><em>J. A.
