Plea, <em>non est factum.</em></summary>\n<summary data-order=\"4\" data-type=\"summary\" id=\"b504-12\">On the trial, the contract offered in evidence was signed with the name of Herriot; but instead of wafer or wax, there was a scrawl with the word <em>seal </em>in the <em>locus sigilli ; </em>and the concluding words off the contract purported a seal in the usual form. A counsellor at law, of the state of Pennsylvania, was sworn as a witness for the plaintiff, and testified that, by the common law of that state, such a mark was a <em>seal.</em></summary>\n<summary data-order=\"5\" data-type=\"summary\" id=\"b504-13\">The defendant\u2019s counsel objected to the contract being read in evidence; but the objection was overruled, and the contract react to the jury.</summary>\n<summary data-order=\"6\" data-type=\"summary\" id=\"b504-14\">A verdict was finally taken for the plaintiff, subject to the opinion of the Court, upon this and other points which arose in the course of the trial.</summary>\n<attorneys data-order=\"7\" data-type=\"attorneys\" id=\"b504-15\"><em>V. </em>Birdseye, for the plaintiff, insisted that, as the contract was to be performed in Pennsylvania, the Court would notice the law of that state in giving it a construction.</attorneys>\n<p data-order=\"8\" data-type=\"legal\" id=\"Ao3\">The <em>ejfebt </em>of the instrument, not merely the <em>remedy </em>tipon it, is the question; and the <em>lex loci </em>applies. <em>Meredith v. Hinsdale, </em>(2 Caines\u2019 Rep. 362,) is in point. That was an action of debt upon a Pennsylvania bond; and it was sustained upon the very ground assumed here. The contract should be carried into effect according to the intention of the parties. They intended that it should operate as a specialty every where. That the law of the state where the contract is to be performed shall govern, without regard to the place of its execution, is abundantly proved by the authorities. <em>(Thompson v. Ketcham, </em>4 John. Rep. 285, and the cases there cited.) This law settles the <em>nature </em>and <em>effect </em>of the contract. It is important that it should be so, for a,variety of <em>reasons; </em>and one is, for preserving due preference in the distribution of <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"509\">*509</page-number>the estates of deceased persons. The <em>remedy </em>is another thing. On determining the degree of the contract, that is left to our own law ; so that the <em>lex fori </em>is not affected. On determining that the scrawl is a seal, the <em>lex fori </em>comes in, and says that the action should be covenant, a <em>remedy </em>already known to the law of the state. The agreement, therefore, gives no new <em>remedy.</em></p>\n<p data-order=\"9\" data-type=\"legal\" id=\"b505-3\">The case of <em>Warren </em>v. <em>Lynch, </em>(5 John. Rep. 239,) although it denies that, according to our own law, any thing short of wax or wafer will constitute a seal, leaves <em>Meredith </em>v. <em>Hinsdale </em>unimpaired as to the only point decided by it.</p>\n<p data-order=\"10\" data-type=\"legal\" id=\"b505-4\">He also cited <em>Jones &amp; Temple </em>v. <em>Logwood, </em>(1 Wash.

But, as the point was an important one, they would look into it farther, and examine the cases cited; and if they should then entertain any doubt, they would call upon him to resume his argument</p>\n<attorneys data-order=\"12\" data-type=\"attorneys\" id=\"b505-6\"><em>N.

The dispute is merely upon the <em>remedy, </em>that is to say, whether the action shall be <em>covenant </em>or <em>assumpsit </em>upon a given contract between two persons within the jurisdiction of the Court. The <em>substance </em>and <em>effect </em>of the recovery is the same in either form. We are satisfied that we cannot sanction <em>Meredith </em>v. <em>Hinsdale, </em>without overturning the entire class of cases which distinguish between the different effects of the <em>lex loci </em>and <em>lex fori. </em>We are so firmly fixed in the conclusion to which we have come, that it will be useless to argue the other points. Being against the plaintiff upon the first, this decides the cause.</p>\n<p id=\"b506-4\">Judgment for the defendant<footnotemark>(a)</footnotemark></p>\n<footnote label=\"(a)\">\n<p id=\"b506-5\"><em> </em>The <em>lex loci </em>and <em>lex fori, </em>to which the above case looks, have probably come more frequently under review in this country than in any other. That the attention of our courts should often be drawn to them, results from the political confederacy of the states, which, while it supports among them close and extensive connections in business and policy, yet holds them sufficiently distinct and independent to cal! into continual exercise that rule which expounds and gives effect to contracts, and other transactions, according to the state law under which they are made, or take place ; but stops there, and carefully distinguishes between <em>construction </em>and <em>right, </em>on the one hand, and <em>remedy </em>on the other. The general rule is acknowledged by the law of nations, and by all the local writers and adjudications relating to it; but the difficulty of its \"application has been very considerable. Hence the great variety of cases and comments to which it has given rise, the embarrassments of the most able and ingenious counsel, and the importance of looking with attention to the rules and adjudged cases upon the subject, not only of England, and other foreign countries, but of sister states, and especially of the United States, whose courts are, on this head, emphatically the arbiters of state differences.</p>\n<p id=\"b506-6\">This subject in itself deserves a treatise, but I can do nothing more here than to arrange and refer to the authorities, giving the substance of some of them. Huberus, <em>in his title De conjlictu legum, </em>has broken the ground the most effectually, I believe, of all the European writers ; but even yet, it must be considered as but little more than broken for the use of the American student. Mr. Wheaton, <em>arg. </em>(3 John. Ch. Rep. 202,) speaks of Huber as having originated the distinction between the <em>lex fori </em>and the <em>lex loci </em><page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"511\">*511</page-number><em>contractus, </em>and his remarks on the <em>lex loci </em>generally are well known to form me text upon which our lawyers proceed. Lord Mansfield used to cite him with approbation, and Mr. Hargrave declared that his writings on the civil law were much esteemed. (Note 44 to Co. Litt. 79, b.) He was quoted, approved and relied upon in <em>Desesbats </em>v. <em>Berquier, </em>(1 Bin. 336,) and the late Chancellor Kent, in <em>Holmes </em>v. <em>Remsen, </em>(4 Johns. Ch. Rep. 469,) says that Huber\u2019s essay, \u201c <em>de conjlictu legum </em>is every where received as containing a doctrine of universal law.\u201d In truth, he is referred to as authority in almost every case where the <em>lex loci </em>has been seriously in question. A sufficient extract^for the purposes of the present subject, was translated, and read in the argument of <em>Emory </em>v. <em>Grenough, </em>(3 Dall. 369, 370 ;) and furnished by Mr- Dallas, the reporter, in a note to that case, (id. p. 370 to 377.) Thus being very generally in the hands of the profession, it need not be repeated here. Suffice it to say, that this extract takes ground broad enough to embrace the whole superstructure of European and American authority relative to the <em>lex loci </em>and <em>lex fori. </em>It is true that some few of his examples have been overruled by our cases, owing to his erroneous application of principles ; but this is no more than will be found true of several cases adjudged upon the same principles, in England, Scotland, and tills country.</p>\n<p id=\"b507-4\">The cases divide themselves into several classes:</p>\n<p id=\"b507-5\">1. <em>The lex loci </em>contractus.] The general proposition upon this head will be found in almost alHho cases from which I shall extract the point decided; but it is more generally laid down, and supported, as follows: that the law of a place where a contract is made, or to be performed, is to govern as to the <em>nature, validity, construction, </em>and <em>effect </em>of such contract; that being valid in such place, it is to be considered equally valid, and to be enforced every where, with the exception of cases in which the contract is immoral or unjust, or in which the enforcing it in a state would bo injurious to the rights, the interest or convenience of such state or its citizens ; and, on the contrary, if a contract be <em>void, </em>or be <em>discharged </em>by the law of the place where it is made or to be performed, it is to be considerd as void or discharged every where, and to be enforced no where.

Bl. 55,) the question arose whether an Irish bankrupt certificate of discharge from a contract made in Ireland, was a discharge in England. The point was treated as a novel one in the- C. B. and went off upon a formal defect in the plea. Since that time, the effect of <em>foreign bankrupt certificates </em>and <em>insolvent discharges </em>has been the subject of much discussion, both in foreign nations and in the United States ; and the attention of courts has been mainly drawn to two different branches of the proceeding, viz. the assignment or <em>cessio bonorum, </em>contested between the assignees and particular creditors who were seeking satisfaction by foreign attachment or other proceeding against the bankrupt or his goods ; or the <em>discharge, </em>contested between particular creditors and the bankrupt.</p>\n<p id=\"b510-7\"><em>The assignment </em>of the <em>bankrupt </em>or <em>insolvent, </em>is at length considered as a general sale of goods by his own act <em>bona fide, </em>and available like any other honest sale against all who claim by lien or sale subsequent.

Thus, the drawer of a bill of exchange at Baltimore on London, (though payable to a British subject resident in England,) having been declared a bankrupt, and discharged from his debts as such, this was holden to bar an action in the English K. B. And the case was expressly put on the ground, that the cause of action having arisen in the United States, and the contract not to be performed elsewhere, and having been followed by a discharge here, it should bo deemed discharged every where. <em>(Potter </em>v. <em>Brown, </em>5 East, 124.) The earlier cases of <em>Ballantine </em>v. <em>Golding, </em>(Cooke\u2019s Bank. Law, 515,) and <em>Smith, </em>v. <em>Buchanan, </em>(1 East, 6,) proceeded upon the same principle. In the latter case, an insolvent discharge of Maryland was denied any effect upon a debt contracted in England; the other common law cases have almost uniformly gone upon the same distinction. <em>(Van Raugh </em>v. <em>Van Arsdaln, </em>3 Caines\u2019 Rep. 154. <em>Ewart </em>v. <em>Coulthard, </em>cited id. 154, 5. 1 Johns.

Thus, <em>a temporary insolvent law of </em>Jamaica, by which debtors were released from all demands against them on surrendering their effects for the benefit of their creditors, the effects to be distributed only among such creditors as should apply within thirty days after public notice of the surrender, was holden inoperative as to a creditor residing in Massachusetts, though the contract was made in Jamaica, and to be performed there. The Court put it on the ground that such a law could not be intended by the legislature to operate beyond the bounds Of Jamaica; the act being manifestly partial or Unjust to foreign creditors, the notice being short, and no provision being made that it should reach them, in such season as would enable then! to participate in its advantages. <em>(Prentiss </em>v. <em>Savage, </em>13 Mass. Rep. 20.) The comity of nations does not require that such a discharge should have ' effect in a foreign country. The fair principles of the contract would be violated by it. (Id. 34.) The same principles were recognized in <em>Tappan </em>v. <em>Poor, </em>(15 Mass. Rep. 419.) In order to take effect, the foreign discharge must, though granted where the cause of action arose, have been complete and executed before action commenced.

(Id.)</p>\n<p id=\"b512-9\">2. <em>Of the lex </em>domicilii.] The first question which occurs under this head is, <em>what shall constitute the domicil of the person, </em>so as to give effect to its law <em>\u00cd </em>In most cases, this is of easy solution ; but it is not always so. <em>The general rules </em>will be found accurately and fully laid down by Rush, President; in <em>Berquier </em>v. <em>O\u2019Daniel, </em>(1 Bin. 349, 351, note,) or more broadly by Ld. Thurlow, in <em>Bruce </em>v. <em>Bruce, </em>in the House of Lords, (2 B. &amp; P. 230, note.) They are, that a man\u2019s being at a place is <em>prima facie </em>evidence that he is domiciled there ; and those who contest this may show that he was there as a traveller, or on particular business, or On a visit, or for the sake of his health, &amp;c. (Id.) His mode of living is not material, Whether on rent, at lodgings, or in the house of a friend. The apparent or avowed intention of constant residence, not the maimer of it, constitutes the domicil. Minute circumstances, in inquiries of this sort, are taken into consideration; as h man\u2019s immediate employment; his general pursuits and habits of life, his' friends and connections. There is no fixed period of time necessary to create' \u00e1 domicil. It may be acquired after the shortest residence' under certain circumstances ; and under others, the longest\" residence may be insufficient foi the purpose. Though declarations are good evidence that one has changed his domicil, yet no fixed views of change can be equivalent to the actual abandonment of one domicil, and the acquisition of another. The domicil-of origin arises from birth and connections. A minor, during pupilage, cannot acquire a domicil of his own. It follows that of his father, and remains until he acquires another, which he cannot do until he becomes a person <em>sui juris. </em>(2 Bin. 251-2, note. <em>Somerville </em>v. <em>Somerville, </em>5 Ves. 750.) The domicil of origin remains until clearly abandoned, and another taken. <em>(Somerville </em>v. <em>Somerville, </em>5 Ves. 750.) Lord Somerville had two domicils, the family seat in Scotland, and a leasehold house in London; and, upon circumstances, the <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"517\">*517</page-number>former, which was also tho domicil of origin, prevailed. (Id.) Whore the lather is dead, tho domicil of the children follows that of the surviving mother. <em>(Potinger </em>v. <em>Wightman, </em>3 Merivale\u2019s Rep. 67.)</p>\n<p id=\"ADWD\">The four cases above cited from 2 B. &amp; P. 230, 1 Bin. 349, note, 5 Ves. 750, and 3 Mcr. 67, contain together a complete treatise on what is to conitituto a domicil, both in the view of our own and foreign jurists, with full references and illustrations. Instead of repeating these, I refer to the cases Shemsolves.</p>\n<p id=\"b513-4\"><em>The domicil being ascertained, \u201c </em>It is,\u201d says Ld. Loughborough, \u201c a clear proposition, not only of the law of England, but of every country in tho world, where law has the semblance of science, that personal property has no locality. The meaning of that is, not that personal property has no visible locality, but that it is subject to that law which governs the person of the owner. With respect to the disposition of it, with respect to the transmission of it, either by succession or the act of the party, it follows tho law of the person. Tho owner in any country' may dispose of his personal property. If he dies, it is \u2019 not the law of tho country in which the property is, but the law of tho country of which he was a subject, that will regulate the succession. For instance, if a foreigner having property in the fmids hero, dies, that property is claimed according to the right of representation given by tho law of his own country.\u201d</p>\n<p id=\"b513-6\"><em>Sill </em>v. <em>Worswick, </em>(1 H.

In <em>Sill </em>v. <em>Worswick, </em>(1 H. Bl. 665,) for instance, both the <em>bankrupt </em>and <em>creditor </em>being <em>residents </em>of England, the latter, after an act of bankruptcy, but before the assignment, sent to his agent in the island of St. Christopher, and attached and' obtained payment of his own debt, which was contracted in England, from a debt due to the bankrupt in St. Christopher. The assignees in England sued the creditor there for the money, as money had and received to their use ; and they recovered upon the principles before cited at large from that case, as laid down by Lord Loughborough. He applied the <em>lex domicilii </em>to the case of the bankrupt, considering the assignment in the same light as a voluntary one made by him; <em>(Holmes </em>v. <em>Remsen, </em>4 Johns. Ch. Rep. 487, same proposition vindicated;) and, therefore, as passing all his property every where, and among it, the very debt of the bankrupt, which the creditor had collected by the process of foreign attachment. The avails of it were, consequently, money had and received to the use of the assignees. The same doctrine was held upon a foreign attachment taken out <em>after assignment </em>in England, in <em>Hunter </em>v. <em>Potts, </em>(4 T. Rep. 182.) Here, at page 192, Lord Kenyon acknowledges and vindicates the <em>lex domicilii </em>as the foundation of his opinion. In <em>Solomons </em>v. <em>Ross, </em>and <em>Jollet </em>v. <em>Duponthieu, </em>(1 H. Bl. 131, 2, note,) the same principles were applied by the English Court of Chancery. These cases preferred a bankrupt assignment in Holland, to a foreign attachment in England. <em>Neal </em>v. <em>Cottingham, </em>(2 H. Bl. 132, note,) preferred an English bankrupt assignment to a foreign attachment in Ireland. These cases given in the note to H. Bl. do not profess to inquire whether the creditor was <em>domiciled </em>in the same country with the bankrupt, or not j nor ot the <em>place </em>where the debt arose.</p>\n<p id=\"b515-2\"><page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"519\">*519</page-number>Lord Loughborough\u2019s reasoning in <em>Sill </em>v. <em>Worswick, </em>(1 H. Bl. Rep. 693,) <em>shows how far the rule is to be qualified by the law of the foreign country. </em>He says, \u201c It by no means follows that a commission of bankrupt has an operation in another country, against the law of that country. I do not wish to have it understood, that it follows, as a consequence from the opinion I am now giving, (I rather think that the contrary would he the consequence of the reasoning I am now using,) that a creditor in that country, not subject to the bankrupt laws, nor affected by them, obtaining payment of his debt and afterwards coming over to this country, would be liable to refund that debt. If he had recovered it in an adverse suit with the assignees, he would clearly not be liable. But if the law of that country preferred him to the assignee, though I must suppose that determination wrong, yet I do not think that my holding a contrary opinion would revoke the determination of that country, however I might disapprove of the principle upon which the law so decided. But another case may possibly occur, of a suit brought against the bankrupt personally; and a case of this sort was stated in the argument, <em>Waring and others </em>v. <em>Knight. </em>I have not been able to get a particular account of that case. It is shortly stated in Cooke\u2019s Bank. Law, 379, that a person having committed an act of bankruptcy, had gone over to Gibraltar, that a commission of bankrupt was taken out against him, and that the defendant brought an action against him in Gibraltar, and obtained judgment, and under the judgment, payment of his debt. Whether the person was resident in Gibraltar prior to the bankruptcy, whether the debt was contracted at Gibraltar, whether he appeared to the commission in England, none of these circumstances are stated. But the decision would undoubtedly be very materially varied by these circumstances. Lord Mansfield held, that the defendant having recovered the debt against the bankrupt, who was personally present at Gibraltar, was not answerable to the assignees for the money.\u201d</p>\n<p id=\"b515-7\"><em>According to the views of Lord Loughborough, </em>the rights of the <em>assignees </em>and the <em>creditor </em>who sues in a foreign country, after the act of bankruptcy or assignment, depend upon the principle of the <em>lex domicilii </em>as applied to the <em>bankrupt </em>on the one hand, and the <em>creditor </em>on the other. Ho puts the case upon the question whether the <em>foreign court </em>in which the attachment is sued, <em>the creditor residing within its jurisdiction, </em>would, <em>on notice of the assignment, and its being set up as a defence, </em>prefer the title of the assignees, and hold the attaching creditor barred. (1 H. Bl. Rep. 692, 3.) Lord Kenyon places the question in the <em>same view, </em>in <em>Hunter </em>v. <em>Potts, </em>(4 T. R. 192,) and both agree that the claim of the assignees must depend on the question, whether the assignment would be <em>recognized as operative by the law of the foreign country; </em>and the latter holds, that, uncontradicted by proof of a contrary law in the foreign country, the <em>lex domicilii </em>of the bankrupt shall prevail. <em>(Harrison </em>v. <em>Sterry, </em>5 Cranch, 289, as explained in <em>Holmes </em>v. <em>Remsen, 4 </em>Johns. Ch. Rep. 488, S. P. 2 H. Bl. 409, S. P.) <em>M\u2019Intosh </em>v. <em>Oglivie, </em>(4 T. R. 193, note,) may be supported by these principles ; and most of the other cases upon the same question, which has been, as before observed, often up between assignees and attaching creditors, will, I believe, bo found to accord with the rules above cited. <em>(Philips </em>v. <em>Hunter, </em><page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"520\">*520</page-number>2 H.

This places <em>bankrupt assignments </em>and <em>ordinary insolvent assignments </em>upon the same footing.
