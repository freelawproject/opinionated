That the cause of action in the firs<em>t </em>count arose in the county of Steuben, &amp;c. and that in the second count in the state of Pennsylvania, &amp;c.

This stipulation will be satisfied by proof that the cause of action arose in a foreign country. <em>(Gerard </em>v. <em>De </em>Robeck, 1 H.Bl.280.)</p>\n<opinion data-order=\"7\" data-type=\"opinion\" id=\"x999-1\" type=\"majority\">\n<author id=\"pAMK\">Curia.</author>\n<p id=\"A7L\">Retain your venue, on stipulating to give material evidence arising in the county of Chenango.</p>\n<p id=\"AyG\"><em>Platt </em>expressing his willingness to do this,</p>\n<p id=\"Ata\">Rule accordingly.</p>\n</opinion>\n</casebody>\n",
