To this plea .the plaintiff demurred <em>instanter., </em>and served a copy of the demurrer on the .defendants attorney; and moved the Court \" <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"419\">*419</page-number><em>for </em>a trial of the issue in fact which had heen joined in the cause; but the-Judge declined trying it. No rule to join in dem trrer was ever entered. After wards the defendant\u2019s attorn\u00e9y entered a rule of course to amend the plea <em>puis dar-r rein continuance </em>; And on the 30th day of October, 1824, served a copy of the amended plea on the plaintiff\u2019s attorney. This plea, in addition 4o the <em>vacatur </em>and restitution pleaded in the first, averred that on the 16th September, 1824, Freeman, the lessor, -had paused the judgment in the ejectment to be vacated, set aside and altogether held for nothing. On the 19th November, 1824, the attorney for the plaintiff returned this copy to the defendant\u2019s attorney, objecting that it was irregular, and that the plaintiff\u2019s attorney was not bound to receive it. This was soon after-wards returned to the plaintiff\u2019s attorney by mail. The defendant\u2019s attorney having entered a rule to reply to the amended plea, gave notice of this to the plaintiff\u2019s attorney, and proceeded to judgment of <em>non pros, </em>for want of a replication, in the same manner as in, the ordinary course of a cause upon the usual plea. He then caused the defendant\u2019s costs to be regularly demanded of Freeman, the lessor, on the 14th April, 1825, delivering him at the same time the copy of a <em>ca. $a. </em>for the costs, with a copy of the taxed bill, and showing him the original <em>ca. sa. </em>and taxed bill.

The amended plea <em>puis darrein continuance </em>was <em>not </em>void <em>for </em>want of being verified by affidavit. (9 John. Rep. 250.)</p>\n<p id=\"b416-7\">The 4th rule of April' term, 1796, is general, that the rule to plead or answer shall, <em>in all cases, </em>be a rule of 20 days after notice of its entry, except in certain specified cases not including pleas <em>puis darrein continuance ; </em>and we see no objection in policy or convenience, against its being extended to these pleas. The 8th rule\" of that .term is also general, that the defendant may amend a special plea which is demurred to; and we think that,, in spirit as well as terms, it embraces a plea <em>puis* darrein continuance. </em>This is not the case of adding a new plea-; but a mere alteration of an old one. Under a rule of course to amend, the defendant has a right to alter his plea in substance, so as to modify, or vary entirely the original ground of defence.</p>\n<p id=\"b416-8\">The plaintiff\u2019s motion must be denied, and the defendant\u2019s granted; but without costs on either side.</p>\n<p id=\"b416-9\">Rule accordingly.</p>\n</opinion>\n</casebody>\n",
