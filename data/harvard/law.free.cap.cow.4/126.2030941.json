On thisstate offacts, the defend-\u00e1nt\u2019had given notice of a non-\u00e9numer\u00e1ted motion to- set \u00b0 aside the default for irregularity. The: \"affidavits iiropposition tethemotion gave the same history,and went on to d\u00e9tab other particulars, viz : - that the'action was-against Root and Keeler as -endorsers ofapromissory note made payable to them jointly, and endorsed with their hands and names respectively. ;-Root had-received :a'regular notice as'\u00e9ndorK\u00e9e\u00edel' had riot <em>y- </em>in consequence of which a verdict had been found for him.

This does not depend on the common law, but on the practice of the Court.</p>\n<p id=\"b123-12\">He next took the ground that here could be no judgment for the plaintiff, upon the whole record. The contract of the defendants was joint; and a-verdict for one is - equivalent to a verdict for both. The note was payable to - them jointly, and their endorsement was, in its very nature, joint. The plaintiff must succeed against all or none, the contract being entire. (Tidd\u2019s Pract. 803-4, and the cases there cited.)</p>\n<p id=\"b123-14\"><em>Collier </em>said this point could not be raised on a non-enuinerated motion. If the defendant'relies upon the proceedings at the Circuit, he should bring the matter up by a' motion in arrest, or at any rate wait till the coming-in of the <em>postea. </em>But,</p>\n<p id=\"b123-15\"><em>The Court </em>said they would hear the motion on its. merits, and consider of the preliminary point.</p>\n<author id=\"b124-6\"><page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"128\">*128</page-number>[Woodworth, J.</author>\n<p id=\"ARV3\">said it came to the simple question, whether you can maintain an action against one of two joint endorsers, if notice he not given to the other.]</p>\n<p id=\"b124-7\"><em>Collier. </em>Root cannot complain of a judgment against him.

As to the other branch of the motion, they <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"129\">*129</page-number>thought it true, as a general proposition, that a notice to one of two joint endorsers, they not being partners, would not affect the other ;<footnotemark>(b)</footnotemark> but they would not now decide the point. The facts on which that objection was grounded, principally came out in the plaintiff\u2019s affidavits, who was probably not anticipating the ground now taken; and there might be circumstances to take the cas\u00e9 out of the general rule. If there were any such, he should have a fair opportunity to show them. Besides, all the facts appear of record, and the defendant might, and perhaps properly should have brought up the matter by way of motion in arrest of judgment. They denied the motion, but without costs.</p>\n<p id=\"b125-4\">Motion denied</p>\n<footnote label=\"(a)\">\n<p id=\"b123-16\"> Vid. <em>Gay </em>v. <em>Rogers and Wait, </em>3 Cowen\u2019s Rep. 368.</p>\n</footnote>\n<footnote label=\"(b)\">\n<p id=\"b125-5\"> Vid.
