The plaintiff does not show this action to be for any cause relating to land. It is an appropriate remedy to recover chattels tortiously taken by one private person from another, and may be substituted for trespass <em>de bonis asportatis, </em>where the owner choses to have the specific chattel, instead of damages. For aught that appears, it is no more local than any action of trespass <em>de bonis asportatis.</em></p>\n<footnote data-order=\"10\" data-type=\"footnote\" id=\"x999-1\" label=\"(a)\">\n<p id=\"Arn\"> This is p. 157-8 of the 3d Lend. ed.</p>\n</footnote>\n<opinion data-order=\"11\" data-type=\"opinion\" id=\"x999-2\" type=\"majority\">\n<author id=\"b42-8\">\n<em>Per Curiam.</em>\n</author>\n<p id=\"A0k\">The only difference which the determination of this motion can make in the rights of the plaintiff, lies between considering the action in nature of a trespass <em>de bonis asportatis, </em>and properly an action of replevin. In the former case, he may retain his venue upon the usual stipulation\u2014in the latter, it can not be changed, in any view upon the facts disclosed, because it is in its nature local. It is true, that replevin lies for a trespass <em>de bonis asportatis, </em>or for a wrongful distress either for rent or <em>damage feasant. </em>In general, however, it is a local action, the place being material and traversable; and we have looked into all the authorities upon the question, to see if there be any exception. We find none ; and without saying whether it might not stand on the same footing as an action of trespass <em>de bonis asportatis, </em>where it appeared, upon the motion, to have been brought for that cause, we deem it our duty to treat it <em>as, prima facie, </em>local. Where nothing appears, therefore, of the particular nature and object of the action, as in this case, but merely that it is an action of replevin, we hold it within the general rule; and the motion must, therefore, be denied.</p>\n<p id=\"b42-9\">Motion denied.</p>\n</opinion>\n</casebody>\n",
