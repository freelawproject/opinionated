Williams, </em>for the defendants, moved to <em>quash </em>or <em>supersede </em>the mandamus,</attorneys>\n<p data-order=\"8\" data-type=\"legal\" id=\"AA8\">1. On the ground that it is defective in form, in omitting to set forth or recite the bill, of exceptions. In <em>Sikes </em>v. <em>Ransom, </em>(6 John. Rep. 279,) this Court say, that our statute is the same as the English, in relation to bills of exceptions ; that the Supreme Court can issue the writ, as well as the Chancery in England. The Court then refer to the English forms, and say that they can be the same in the Supreme Court; that the writ, <em>after reciting the complaint, </em>commands the Judges, <em>si ita est, tunc sigilla vestra, Spc. </em>and if it be returned <em>quod non ita est, </em>the answer would be sufficient. In Bull. N. P. 316, it is said, if the Judges refuse to sign the bill, the party grieved by the denial may have a writ upon the statute, commanding the same to be <em>done juxta formam statuti; </em>it recites the form of an exception taken and overruled, and it follows, <em>vobis prcecipimus quod si ita est tuncsigilla vestra apponatis, </em><page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"75\">*75</page-number>and if it be returned\u2019, <em>quod non ita est, </em>an action will lie for a false return, arid thereupon the surmise will be tried, &amp;c.</p>\n<p data-order=\"9\" data-type=\"legal\" id=\"b71-4\">From these authorities, it is evident that the <em>mandamus </em>must recipe the bill of exceptions tendered, that the Judges below may see' whether the bill they are required to seal comprises the same matters as that tendered; and that they may be able to return specifically, <em>quod non ita est, </em>or otherwise, according to the fact.</p>\n<p data-order=\"10\" data-type=\"legal\" id=\"b71-5\">Nothing appears upon the mandamus but what the Common Pleas did right in directing a nonsuit; or, if otherwise, there is not that point of law stated which would be the subject of a bill. The contrary, rather, appears, and that there is no point of law to which a bill of exceptions can be taken. (2 Caines\u2019 Rep. 168.)</p>\n<p data-order=\"11\" data-type=\"legal\" id=\"b71-6\">The counsel also objected to the manner of service, as irregular.</p>\n<attorneys data-order=\"12\" data-type=\"attorneys\" id=\"b71-7\"><em>J. Edwards, </em>referred to Bac. Abr. <em>Mandamus, </em>(B) to show that a motion to quash the writ would not lie before a return made and filed.</attorneys>\n<p data-order=\"13\" data-type=\"legal\" id=\"AKsO\">The manner of service was right as settled by this Court in <em>The Peoples. The Supervisors and Judges of Ulster, </em>(1 John. Rep. 64.) The bill of exceptions need not appear in the writ. It is always tendefed to the Judges at the trial, and, in practice, it is served on them with the <em>mandamus. </em>If not done, or the service is, in any manner, irregular, it may be cause for refusing a peremptory <em>mandamus, </em>but is no cause for quashing or superseding the writ. The form of a <em>mandamus </em>to set aside a rule, as drawn by counsel, in <em>Blunt </em>v. <em>Greenwood, </em>which is given at length in 1 Cowen\u2019s Rep. 22, was not more explicit than this. The Judges should make a return upon which issue may be taken, and should not be allowed to quash the writ upon their affidavit.</p>\n<p data-order=\"14\" data-type=\"legal\" id=\"b71-8\">He concluded, by moving that a peremptory mandamus issue.</p>\n<opinion data-order=\"15\" data-type=\"opinion\" id=\"x999-1\" type=\"majority\">\n<author id=\"b71-9\">\n<em>Curia.</em>\n</author>\n<p id=\"AL8j\">It is objected that a motion to quash the writ .rill not lie till it is returned. Such is the general rule; but * case is cited, <em>(The People </em>v. <em>The Judges and </em>Sup<page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"76\">*76</page-number><em>ervisors of Ulster, </em>1 John. Rep. 64,) hy which it appears that the service of an alternative <em>mandamus </em>maybe by delivering a .copy, at the same time showing the original. rp^ party thus having a right to retain the writ, the Judges must make a return without it. The writ itself cannot be returned by them; and we think the case an exception to the rule. The motion is, for that reason, in time. We think, however, it was not necessary to recite the bill of exceptions in the writ; the motion to quash or supersede it is, therefore, denied; but as the defendants may not have had time to prepare a return, we give them to the next term for this purpose, when, if the retumbe not made, a peremptory mandamus must go.</p>\n<p id=\"b72-6\">Rule accordingly.</p>\n</opinion>\n</casebody>\n",
