The bill proved very defective on the trial. A verdict was rendered for the plaintiff; but a new trial was granted upon the merits, m February term, 1824. The cause had since been twice noticed for trial, and now stood noticed for the Albany Circuit. The first bill was defective in consequence of the plaintiff\u2019s attorney not being fully instructed by his client, who lived 400 miles from him.
