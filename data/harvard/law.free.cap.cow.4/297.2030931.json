That the inspectors of election in the town of Niskayuna did, at the time of his appointment, deliver to Tymesen a true copy of the statement of votes, given at the said election in the town of \u00d1iskayu\u00f1a, certified by all the inspectors who attended-the election in the town, with which, last mentioned certific\u00e1te he did, after his appointment, to wit, on the Tuesday next following the \u00bflection, at one o\u2019clock in the afternoon of that day, attend at the clerk\u2019s office of the county Schenectady; and did, in person deliver the last mentioned certificate to the clerk, with whom the same has ever since remained; of which delivery, all the canvassers herein next mentioned at the time of their meeting had notice. That on Tuesday next following the election, at the hour <em>of one </em>o\u2019clock in the afternoon, the following persons, having been duly appointed and received certificates in writing of that fact, to attend at the clerk\u2019s office of the county of Schenectady, for the puipose \u25a0 expressed in the tenth section of the act, did also attend at the clerk\u2019s office, and' did deliver to the clerk true copies of the statements of votes taken at the election in their respective towns and wards, duly certified, that is to say, John F.

That after this determination of the canvassers, and before the hour of four o\u2019clock in the afternoon, Tymesen did procure a paper writing in the following words: \u201cWe, the inspectors of the election in the town of Niskayuna, in the county of Schenectady, do appoint Tymesen, one of the inspectors of said election, to preside at the election to be held in said town, for the officers to be elected in the said county, on the fourth day of November, and the two succeeding days, in the year one thousand eight hundred and twenty-two, to do and perform all such duties as appertain to the said election, by virtue of the act regulating elections. Dated this fourth day of November, 1822.\u201d Which was signed by Jacob O. Van Vranlcen and Cornelius B. Tymesen, as inspectors of election of the town of Niskayuna, on the Tuesday next following the election. That Tymesen dicl offer this writing to the canvassers, and did again claim a seat with them, as a member of the board of canvassers, before the hour of four o\u2019clock in the afternoon of the Tuesday next following the election, and did inform the canvassers, so assembled as a board of canvassers, that himself and Jacob C. Van Vranken were a majority of the inspectors who had presided at the poll of the election in the town of Niskayuna ; but the said canvassers did a second time, by vote, determine, that Tymesen had no right to a seat with the board, and did exclude him therefrom, alleging, among other rcasons, for excluding him, that the writing was not subscribed by a majority of the inspectors, who had presided at the poll <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"310\">*310</page-number>of the election in Niskayuna, exclusive of Tymesen. That after this determination, and after the hour of four o\u2019clock of the afternoon of the Tuesday next following the election, they, with the exception of Tymesen, proceeded to calculate and ascertain the whole number of votes, which were given at the election for the several persons voted for as governor, lieutenant governor, senator, a representative in the congress of the United States, member of assembly, sheriff, clerk of the county, and coroners, at the election in the first and second wards of the city of Schenectady; and then adjourned the further canvass of the votes of the county and their meeting until nine o\u2019clock in the forenoon of the following day. That after this adjournment, and before the hour to which the canvassers had adjourned their meeting, Tymesen procured another paper writing or certificate in the words following: \u201c We, the majority of the inspectors actually presiding at the election in the town of Niskayuna, in the county of Schenectady, on the fourth day of November instant, and the two succeeding days, in the said town, for governor, lieutenant governor, four senators, an assemblyman, sheriff, county clerk, four coroners, and one representative to congress, do certify that we did, on the sixth day of November instant, appoint Cornelius E. Tymesen, also actually presiding at said election, to do and perform such duties as appertain to him by virtue of such appointment, and as are prescribed in the tenth section of the act for regulating elections, passed April 17th, 1822. Dated 12th November, 1822 which last mentioned certificate was signed by Peter D. Yan Yranken and Jacob C. Van Yranken as inspectors. That on the 13th day of November, A. D. 1822, at the hour of nine o\u2019clock in the forenoon, being the day and hour to which the canvass of the remainder of the votes of the county, and the meeting of the canvassers were adjourned, and immediately after the canvassers had met, and were about to continue the canvass of the remainder of the votes, Tymesen, accompanied by Jacob C. Yan Yranken and Peter D. Van Yranken, did appear before the board, and Tymesen did present the last mentioned certificate to the canvassers, and Jacob C. Yan Yranken and Peter D. Van Yranken offered <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"311\">*311</page-number>to the board to make oath, that Tymesen had been appointed by the inspectors who presided at the poll in the town of Niskayuna, at the election, to attend with a certificate of the votes of the town of Niskayuna, at the clerk\u2019s office of the county, as a member of the board of canvassers, and Tymesen did claim a seat at, and to be a member of the board, and to act as one of the canvassers of the votes of the county, so given at the election ^ but a majority of the canvassers refused to receive any evidence of the appointment of Tymesen as one of the board, alleging, among other reasons therefor, that such proof ought to have been offered previous to the hour of four o\u2019clock in the afternoon of the Tuesday next following the election; and did thereupon, a third time, by vote, determine, that Tymesen. had no right to a seat at the board as a member thereof; and did again exclude him therefrom. That the remaining canvassers did proceed to calculate, estimate, and ascertain the remainder of the votes given at the election; and having completed such estimate and calculation, and ascertained the amount of votes given at the election, a motion was made by one of the canvassers, and seconded by another, that they should calculate, estimate, and ascertain the number of votes given in the town of Niskayuna, which, motion the chairman refused to put to vote. Whereupon, one of the canvassers made a motion, that the chairman and secretary of the canvassers should sign a certificate of the result of the canvass of the votes of the county, as it had been obtained by excluding the votes of the town of Niskayuna, and from canvassing the votes given in the other towns and wards of the said county, which was carried by the votes of a majority of the canvassers; and that, thereupon, the chairman and secretary did sign a certificate, which commenced with the following words; \u201cAt a meeting of the board of canvassers, duly organized and held in and for the county of Schenectady, at the clerk\u2019s office in the city of Schenectady, in said county, on the 12th and 13th days of November, in the year 1822, pursuant to the act entitled, \u2018 an act for regulating elections,\u2019 passed April the 17th, 1822, Simon A. Groot was chosen chairman, <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"312\">*312</page-number>and Jelles A Fonda, clerk of the said county, was, <em>ex officio, </em>secretary of the said board, the following persons \"appeared and constituted the said board, they being inspectors of elections in the several wards and towns in the said county, and having been respectively appointed by the major part of the inspectors of their respective wards and towns, to preside at an election held therein, on the 4th day of November, 1822, and the two succeeding days inclusive, for the purpose of choosing one member of assembly, o\u00f1\u00e9 sheriff, four coroners and one clerk, that is to say, John N. Marselis, of the first ward, Simon A. Groot, of the second ward, none admitted of the town' of Niskayuna. The certificate's and statements of the votes of the town of Niskayuna were denied acceptance. The inspectors had neglected the necessary appointrfient for a presiding inspector, pursuant to the 10th section of the act regulating elections, passed April 17th, 1822. Harmanus A. Tan Slyck, of the town of Rotterdam, (and so of eacbi town.) The board then proceeded to calculate and ascertain the whole number of votes, given at such election, in the said county for the several persons voted for the offices above specified; and thereupon, the said board do, according to the act aforesaid, set down in writing the names of the several candidates so voted for at such election, for any and every of the offices aforesaid, and the numbers of votes in words written at full length, which were given at such election, for the said candidates respectively.\u201d That this said certificate then contained a statement of the votes given in each town and ward of the county, except in the town of Niskayuna, for (among other officers) the candidates for the office of sheriff, by which statement it appears, that the defendant received at the election, in the towns and wards of the county, exclusive of the votes of the town of Niskayuna, 732 votes for the office of sheriff) and that Gersho'm Van Toast, the relator, received in the towns and wards of the county, exclusive of the votes of the town of Niskayuna, 719' votes for the office of sheriff; and that the defendant and Gershom Van Toast, each received more votes than any other Candidates for the office of sheriff at the election. That the last mentioned <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"313\">*313</page-number>certificate, after detailing the votes for the respective candidates for the offices of assemblyman, clerk, sheriff and coroners, in each town and ward of the county, except the town of Niskayuna, concludes, so far as relates to the office of sheriff, in the following words: \u201c And do certify, determine and declare, conformably to the statements or certificates, made and delivered by the inspectors of elections of the several wards and towns in the said county, that Harmanus A. Van Slyck, by the greatest number of votes in the said county, was duly elected sheriff of the said county. In testimony whereof we, the chairman and secretary of the said board of canvassers, have hereunto set our hands, this thirteenth day of November, in the vear one thousand eight hundred and twenty-two.\u201d That the last mentioned certificate is entered by the county clerk at full length, in a book by him provided for that purpose, and kept in his office; and further, that a true copy thereof, subscribed by the chairman and secretary, was delivered to Van Slyck, and another copy thereof published in the newspaper printed in the- county. That in the town of Niskayuna, the defendant and Van Voast each obtained more votes than any other person for the office of sheriff; and that the defendant obtained for the office 26 votes onty, and Van Voast 49 votes, which was duly certified in the certificate so signed by the inspectors of the election, and delivered to Tymesen, and by him delivered to the county clerk as before mentioned. That the canvassers did reject, and refuse to canvass and estimate the votes given in the town of Niskayuna, at the election, and certified and delivered to the county clerk, and that the votes given in the town of Niskayuna for Van Voast, added to the votes given for him in the several towns and wards of the county, for the office of sheriff, give him a majority of ten votes for the office of sheriff, over any other person voted for at the election. That the defendant upon receiving the copy of the certificate signed by the chairman and secretary, on the first day of January, A. D. 18,23, took the oath, and gave the security prescribed by law, and entered upon the office of sheriff of the county of Schenectady; and held this office ever since; and that the defendant, <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"314\">*314</page-number>at the time of the election, and on the first day of January i823) Was a freeholder.

This was not necessary. The secretary of state was mistaken in his construction of the 10th section of the <em>act for regulating elections, </em>(sess. 46, ch. 250, s. 10.) The words are, \u201c that one of the said inspectors, who\" shall actually preside at such election in each of the towns and wards of this state, to be appointed for that purpose by the major part <em>of the </em>inspectors who so preside, shall, on, &amp;c. attend at the clerk\u2019s office, &amp;c.\u201d In the 9th section or any previous sections, there is no allusion to a presiding inspector; and it is plain from the several provisions in relation to the proceedings of the town board, that all and each of them are to be considered and treated as presidents within the meaning of the 10th section. Either of them may be appointed after the poll has closed; and no particular form of appointment is necessary. The secretary directs, in his note, that the appointment should be made before the opening of the poll. Suppose the one then appointed should be sick, die, or otherwise incapable of attending, must the votes be lost?</p>\n<p data-order=\"51\" data-type=\"legal\" id=\"AjY\">[Woodworth, J. I think there is nothing in the act that requires this proceeding.]</p>\n<p data-order=\"52\" data-type=\"legal\" id=\"AUOG\">There are several cases in which certificates are made necessary by the town board, but a president, as such, is not <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"315\">*315</page-number>once mentioned. The inspectors are treated as having the same equal authority throughout, and in every respect.</p>\n<p data-order=\"53\" data-type=\"legal\" id=\"b311-4\">[The Court told Mr. Jones that he need not pursue this point any further for the present; but they would hear the other side upon it]</p>\n<attorneys data-order=\"54\" data-type=\"attorneys\" id=\"b311-5\">Jones, then cited the following authorities to show that an information in nature of a <em>quo warranto </em>was the proper remedy in this case:</attorneys>\n<p data-order=\"55\" data-type=\"legal\" id=\"AOI\"><em>The King </em>v. Godwin, (Dougl. 398,) <em>Rex </em>v. <em>Vice-Chancellor of Cambridge, </em>(3 Burr. 1647,) <em>The People </em>v. <em>Sweeting, (2 </em>John. Rep. 184,) <em>The People </em>v. <em>The Mayor, &amp;c. of New York, </em>(3 John. Cas. 79.) 1 R. L. 107. The granting of a mandamus and an information in nature of a <em>quo warranto, </em>he said, depend much upon the same principles; the one being to admit an officer improperly excluded; the other to oust one who has usurped an office illegally, in order to make way for the rightful candidate. (2 Esp. Dig. 343, Gould\u2019s ed. 2 Hawk. P. C. ch. 26, s. 9.)</p>\n<attorneys data-order=\"56\" data-type=\"attorneys\" id=\"b311-6\"><em>A. C. Paige, </em>and <em>M. T. Reynolds, </em>for the defendant.</attorneys>\n<p data-order=\"57\" data-type=\"legal\" id=\"As1x\">If the canvass were an original proceeding in this Court, there might be no difficulty in saying that the defendant should no^hold his place as sheriff; but there is an insuperable impediment to their interference at this stage, and in this manner. The certificate of determination of the board of canvassers is conclusive evidence of the legal election of the defendant. It can neither be impeached nor contradicted. The only guard against misconduct is provided by the 19th section of the act. If the canvassers wilfully violate their oath, they are subject to the penalty of 500 dollars. This Court might, for the reason relied on in this case, review every canvass of an election, not excepting that of governor, lieut. governor, &amp;c. by the state canvassers. Upon the same ground, an information would lie against a member of either house of the legislature; for if this Court have jurisdiction, it can be taken away only by express provision. When organized pursuant to the 10th section, a majority of the county board are, by the same section, to <em>determine, &amp;c. upon the person or persons duly </em><page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"316\">*316</page-number>elected, <em>&amp;c. as sheriff, &amp;c. </em>The authority here is judicial; an\u00bf <em>it </em>is plain, from the whole act on this subject, the legisr lature intended that the determination should be as far binding and conclusive as a judgment in a court of justice.</p>\n<p data-order=\"58\" data-type=\"legal\" id=\"b312-5\">Yery great inconveniences will result from a contrary construction. Suppose the defendant to be ousted; anew sheriff .cannot be immediately chosen: the board cannot be convened ; they are <em>functus officio: </em>their powers are limited.. As a body, they must be made up of the town boards, which are continually changing ; and, if otherwise, they can do no .act .after the Tuesday, or some adjourned day next succeeding the election. They cannot again convene. No subsequent board can perform their duties. No process can be issued to restore Van Voast; and the county must for a time remain without a sheriff. The coroners cannot take the county. Their powers are inadequate, being principally judicial; seldom ministerial. (5 Com, Dig. Officer, (G. 5 to 13.) 1 Bl. Com. 348-9. 1 R. L. 420, 1, s. 5.) In his ministerial capacity he acts strictly as a substitute for the sheriff in the case of his death, partiality, &amp;c. What, in the mean time, is to become of the jail and the prisoners <em>1 </em>Is the door to be thrown open to them ? If the Court sees that such a consequence must follow, they will not interfere. It is a maxim that if the right of an individual conflict with the public safety, the former must yield.</p>\n<p data-order=\"59\" data-type=\"legal\" id=\"Ats\">By the 14th section .of the act regulating elections, the Judges of this Court are, upon certain events, to act as state canvassers ; and the powers of state and county canvassers are conferred in nearly the same terms. Would you interfere and grant an information upon a canvass of two of your own body <em>1 </em>You must do it upon the principle relied,on here. The legislature, obviously, never intended that .this Court should exercise the power of review. The case is one of the first .impression. Not one case of an information in nature of a <em>quo warranto </em>to try a right to the office of sheriff can be produced. There is but one instance in the books of such .a proceeding against an elective public officer, aud-that was a supervisor,<footnotemark>(a)</footnotemark> where it was refused on thground that the term of .office had nearly expired. Adhoweyer, that it will lie in that case, it does not <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"317\">*317</page-number>follow that it will lie against a sheriff. There is no board, as in this case, vested with judicial powers. The Justices of the town are to preside, with authority to say who shall vote, but not who is elected. The canvass is a ministerial act. (2 R L. 127, s. 2, 3.) The case of <em>Rex </em>v. <em>The Vice-Chancellor of Cambridge, </em>cited from Burrow, 1647, was a proceeding by mandamus. But admitting the principle to be the same, it will be found, on examining that case, that the power of the canvassers was not judicial. The statute (1 R. L. 418, 19, s. 1) requires that the county should be assigned to the new sheriff This is done. Suppose the defendant to be ousted of his office, to whom shall he assign <em>1 </em>The statute requires that he should assign to his <em>successor. </em>Here he has none. It requires that the assignment should be by the sheriff. Being ousted of his office, no one is left to perform that duty. The Court will look to the interests of the public. The King\u2019s Bench have denied a <em>certiorari </em>to remove an assessment of the land tax. <em>(Rex </em>v. <em>King et al. </em>2 T. R 234.) So of a poor rate, on the ground of general inconvenience. (2 Str. 932, 975.) And they will act upon the same principle in this case. The defendant has prisoners in custody, whom he cannot hold; perhaps both himself and bail will be left without accountability to creditors. At any rate, he is regularly in; and the hazard and loss of an ouster should not be visited upon his head, who is found to be in regular possession of the office, by the act of a board of canvassers.</p>\n<p data-order=\"60\" data-type=\"legal\" id=\"b313-3\">Suppose an inspector had not attended from the town of Niskayuna, would the Court interfere, because the constitu-' tion requires a majority ? Where is the Court to stop ? Will they descend to the towns and look to their proceedings ? Because an improper vote may have been received, will they examine and deduct it ? Is this practicable ? Beside, the ceremony of a canvass is indeed an idle one, if liable to be thus overturned. It has no binding force, and might as, Well have been omitted altogether by the act.</p>\n<p data-order=\"61\" data-type=\"legal\" id=\"b313-4\">If this Court have jurisdiction to review the determination of the board of canvassers, them reviewing power can. only be exercised through the medium of a certiorari^ <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"318\">*318</page-number>and until reversed in this form, it remains valid and eon-elusive, and cannot be questioned by an information in nature of a <em>quo warranto. </em>A certiorari is necessary to reverse an improper appointment of a constable by two Justices. <em>(Wood </em>v. Peake, 8 John. Rep. 69.) The reason is, because the 2 R. L. 127; s. 5, conferring this power of appointment, creates a judicial, authority, from the exercise of which a certiorari lies.- (<em>Wilde </em>v. <em>Washburn, </em>16 John. Rep. 49.) And the power conveyed by. the stab ute in question is as plainly so as-that, given by the .earlier, statute in relation to the appointment of a constable. For, the cases in which a certiorari will, in. general; lie, and is necessary, the Court are referred to Smith. v. <em>Lewis, </em>(3 John. Rep. 168-9, per Kent, Ch. J.) <em>Lawton </em>v. <em>The Comrs. of H. W. of Cambridge, </em>(2 Caines\u2019 Rep. 179,) <em>Learned </em>v. <em>Duval, </em>(3 John. Cas. 141,) <em>The People </em>v. <em>Runkel, </em>(6 John. Rep. 334,) <em>Rex </em>v. <em>Inhabitants of---in Glammorganshire, </em>(I Ld. Raym. 580,) <em>Cross </em>v. <em>Smith, </em>(1 Salk. 146,) 1 Bac. Abr. <em>Certiorari, (B), Rex </em>v. <em>The Inhabitants of Great Marlow </em>East, 244.) The certificate of determination was a record, the history of a judicial decision, unimpeachable for defect or-illegality; and no averment is admissible against it. (1 Chit. Pl. 353-4, 480-1. 1 Phil. Ev. 218, 219, ed. 1820, and the, cases there cited. <em>M\u2019Lean </em>v. <em>Hugarin, </em>13 John. Rep. 184;) The writ of certiorari :is the only known and acknowledged process-to reverse the judicial decision of an inferior-tribunal. A <em>quo warranto </em>is inapplicable, except when the power to be-reviewed is ministerial.</p>\n<p data-order=\"62\" data-type=\"legal\" id=\"b314-7\">But the board of canvassers decided correctly in refusing the inspector from Niskayuna his seat; and in refusing to canvass the votes from that town. The, attending, inspector should have been appointed on the- first day- of-the election <em>; </em>and that appointment should have been made in writing .and signed by a majority of the inspectors. The forms of instruments and proceeding, promulgated-by the secretary of state, were sanctioned by the-statute, (sess. 45, ch. 25, s. 30,) by which it was made -his-duty-to furnish them. There should be a written appointment in the hands of. the <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"319\">*319</page-number>attending inspector, to inform the board of his authority. The act of appointment should be written ; and, at any rate, made out during, or immediately after the election, not at any distance of time. These successive certificates were a mere recital of what was previously done.</p>\n<p data-order=\"63\" data-type=\"legal\" id=\"b315-4\">An information in the nature of a <em>quo warranto </em>against a sheriff cannot be brought on the relation of an individual. Van Voast has no interest in the question, because this Court have no power to restore him ; and where an individual\" has no interest, he cannot be received as relator. <em>(Rex </em>v. Williams, 1 Burr. 402, 407. 3 Bl. Com. 262, 263, 264, note 1. <em>Rex </em>v. Wallis, 5 T. R. 375. <em>Rex </em>v. <em>Marsden, </em>3 Burr. 1812,1816,1817. <em>Rex </em>v. <em>Hall, </em>1 Barnwell &amp; Creswell, 237. <em>Commonwealth </em>v. <em>The Tin. Fire and Mar. Ins. Co. in Newburyport, </em>5 Mass. Rep. 230.) The proceeding should be in the name of the People, without a relator.</p>\n<p data-order=\"64\" data-type=\"legal\" id=\"b315-5\">The defendant was bound to take the office or be indicted and punished. <em>(Rex </em>v. <em>Wallis, </em>5 T. R. 375, 381, per Buffer, J. 5 Jac. L. Dict. 377, 8, ed. 1811, tit. <em>Quo Warranto. </em>1 Bl. Com. 341. 2 Chit. C. L. 267, note (x). <em>The Attorney General </em>v. <em>Read, </em>2 Mod. 300, arg. for the plaintiff. 6 Com. Dig. <em>Viscount, </em>(A. 2.) And there is a difference made in several of the cases just cited between one compelled to take a burthensome office, and one claiming and coming in as a volunteer. The defendant was made sheriff by the act of others.</p>\n<p data-order=\"65\" data-type=\"legal\" id=\"b315-6\">If judgment be rendered against the defendant, the fine should be mere nominal. The information in nature of a <em>quo warranto </em>is for the purpose of trying a civil right; and the treatment of it as a criminal proceeding is formal merely. <em>(The People </em>v. <em>Utica Ins. Co. </em>per Spencer J. 15 John. Rep. 387. 3 Bac. Ab. <em>Informations, </em>(A), p. 636, ed. 1813. <em>Rex </em>v. <em>Shepherd, </em>4 T. R. 385. 3 Bl. Com. 262, 264, note (1).) This is the first proceeding of the kind against a sheriff. The town certificate of appointment was signed by two only of the inspectors, one of whom was the carrier of the votes ; and the supplemental certificates were entirely unavailing; The secretary\u2019s directions were taken as the guide ; and all proceeded if ycod faith. The rea<page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"320\">*320</page-number>sons fully appear for every step that was taken. The fme goes to the people, and is no benefit to the relator. Under these circumstances, there is nothing to take the case out of the general rule, that the fine should be nominal only.</p>\n<attorneys data-order=\"66\" data-type=\"attorneys\" id=\"b316-7\"><em>A. Van Vechten, </em>in reply.</attorneys>\n<p data-order=\"67\" data-type=\"legal\" id=\"AyHo\">The question is, whether the defendant was <em>elected, </em>or <em>canvassed, </em>into office. If the lah ter, he is not sheriff. It is admitted that the election was regular. The work was well done, so far as that was concerned. We deny that the act of the county board was judicial. It was merely ministerial. They are required to cast up the votes' as returned ; and any one who understands arithmetic can do this. They have power to do nothing more. The addition gives the result. They are not to say who are or who are not competent voters ; or whether the votes were to be received and counted ; but merely to fix the majority from the return made ; and declare the result, upon the certificate of the town inspectors, who are required to certify the votes at full length. Is this a judicial act ? t Then every schoolmaster in the state becomes \u00e1 judge, if he happens to be chosen an inspector. Some degree of judgment must be exercised, to be sure but not that sort of judicial discretion, we trust, which is to control the constitution. <em>Rex </em>v. <em>Vice-Chancellor of Cambridge, </em>(3 Burr. 1647.) is decisive that the <em>election, </em>not the decision of the canvassers, confers the right.</p>\n<p data-order=\"68\" data-type=\"legal\" id=\"b316-8\">The votes are to be certified by the town inspectors, two copies made.; one to be deposited in the town clerk\u2019s office before the canvass commences ; and another to be delivered to the county clerk by the inspector appointed to attend the county board ; this also before the canvass commences. The mere possession of this copy by the inspector is, at least, <em>prima facie </em>evidence of his appointment. No new officer is to be elected. The inspectors of the town, are all and each of them presidents .; and the right to deliver the votes and act as a member of the county board is inci-. dent to the office of inspector. Tymesen had a statement, of votes duly canvassed. This informed the board of all it was requisite .they should know. If there was fraud, or any thing surreptitious on the part of the inspector, it then lay with the board to show it.</p>\n<p data-order=\"69\" data-type=\"legal\" id=\"b317-3\"><page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"321\">*321</page-number>The secretary could impose no form not required by the election law. The member of the county board is to be appointed by his fellow inspectors. This is all which the act requires. No writing is necessary. No particular time is required; and are we gravely to be told, that the power given to the secretary, to prescribe'the forms of proceeding, enables him to do away or neutralize the act ? The secretary thought it a good thing to have a president; and it might be well enough ; but the inspectors have indulged in a bolder fancy, and have made the omission avoid all the proceedings.</p>\n<p data-order=\"70\" data-type=\"legal\" id=\"b317-4\">I have said a certificate is to be filed in the town clerk\u2019s office. Is not this a judicial act as well as that of the county canvassers ? If so, here would be record against record, an estoppel by which the county board should have been governed. This alone would answer the notion of conclusiveness. Because the Court examine the county canvass, it is a <em>non sequitur </em>that they may go back to the town poll. Every thing there has been regularly done. The maxim of law is, that there is no wrong without a remedy. The right to interfere with wrongful elections by <em>mandamus </em>or <em>quo warranto </em>existed at common law; and is recognized and regulated by statute, (1 R. L. 107.) The former is to compel admission when the office is vacant; the latter to oust when it is improperly filled. The statute extends to any office or franchise in the state; being much broader than the English. An information has repeatedly been allowed in relation to public elective offices. <em>(The People </em>v. <em>The </em>Mayor, <em>&amp;c. of New York, </em>3 John. Cas. 79. <em>The People </em>v. <em>Sweeting, 2 </em>John. Rep. 184.) The last case was that of a supervisor; and it was not questioned that the information would have lain, had not the term of office nearly elapsed before it was applied for. Yet no substantial distinction exists between the powers of the inspectors at town meeting, in reference to the supervisor, and those of the county board as to the sheriff. It is merely counting and estimating the votes in either case.</p>\n<p data-order=\"71\" data-type=\"legal\" id=\"b317-5\">It is not necessary to reconvene the county board in order to restore Van Voast. The verdict of the jury, and the judgment of this Court, will answer every requisite purpose.</p>\n<p data-order=\"72\" data-type=\"legal\" id=\"A5V\"><page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"322\">*322</page-number>This Hourt have nothing to do with the consequences. if the defendant he. an usurper,he .must be ousted. 'The Court have no \u2019dispensing power; .and if the facts .found warrant-it, they \u00e1re in duty-bound-to prono\u00fance judgment of ouster. It is asked, how do you get Van Voast in ? It might as well be asked how you get .the defendant .out\u2019? If-the-Court have the means of executing their judgment by\u2018.the proper officer, then- there is no .difficulty in either. All Yan Yoast has-.to do on . ouster of the defendant, is .to give security, and \u00a1take .the oath of office. The-custody of the county devolves, in the mean time, to the jailer <em>defacto,, </em>who must give over the jail to the sheriff <em>de jure. </em>Gentlemen need be under no,concern as to <em>the modus operandi. </em>We will see to-it.; -and endeavor tohe sufficiently advised of-the-manner in which our rights are\" to he \u2022 enforced and maintained.</p>\n<p data-order=\"73\" data-type=\"legal\" id=\"AtO\">Yan Yoast was -the proper relator. In the view we have taken, .he has the highest interest, and is receivable upon gentlemen\u2019s own principles. He has the right, and is the only one who would come in and assume the responsibility for costs.</p>\n<p data-order=\"74\" data-type=\"legal\" id=\"b318-6\">A certiorari ,is inapplicable. It would be no remedy. We are \u00a1necessarily here by .information in order to show the falsity .of the decision. -A certiorari would presuppose the truth of the record. We aver its \"falsity. To whom\" can a certiorari issue ? Gentlemen say the -board is dissolved ; and it cannot go to \"them. : On <em>quo warranto </em>the facts are'tried by a jury, the Court give judgment of ouster.; the rightful claimant comes in; and the\u2018Court will either.give judgmenttothis effect,-or-grant a mandamus to theproper authority, compelling them-to receive-him.</p>\n<p data-order=\"75\" data-type=\"legal\" id=\"ADb5\">-It is, .perhaps, difficult to determine, whether an information lies to -try the title of the Governor and state officers. The Governor is the representative, of the state; andan appeal from the state 'canvassers -may not exist. It is a case, perhaps, to which neither the common or statute law extends. But it by no means follows, that the Court have not power in this instance. Because a case may be put a little puzzling, it-does not deprive the Court of jurisdiction. The con stitution gives the right to congress, senate- and assembly to <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"323\">*323</page-number>determine all questions upon the election of their-member; and impliedly excludes the. jurisdiction of the Court in those cases.</p>\n<footnote data-order=\"76\" data-type=\"footnote\" id=\"x999-1\" label=\"(a)\">\n<p id=\"b312-15\"><em> The People v.

The statute is comprehensive in its terms. It extends to all persons who shall usurp, intrude into, or unlawfully hold and execute any office or franchise within this state. The jurisdiction of the Court cannot well be doubted, when the question relates to a public office. The decision of officers acting ministerially is sought to be reviewed. In <em>The People </em>v. <em>The Mayor of New York, </em>(3 John. Cas. 79,) and <em>The same </em>v. <em>Sweeting, </em>(2 John. Rep. 184,) the Court entertained jurisdiction; in one case wheretherelator claimed to have been elected to the office of alderman; in the other, to that of supervisor; and considered an information as the proper remedy to try the rights of the parties.</p>\n<p id=\"b319-10\">It was contended on the argument, that the decision of the board of canvassers was conclusive, until reversed; and could only be reviewed by certiorari. This objection cannot prevail. The duties of the canvassers are ministerial. They are required by the act to attend at the cleric\u2019s office, and calculate and ascertain the whole number of votes given at any election; and certify the same to be a true canvass. This is not a judicial act, but merely ministerial. They have no power to controvert the votes of the electors. If they deviate from the directions of the statute, and certify in favor of a sheriff not duly elected, he is liable to be ousted by information. The trial is had upon the right of .the party holding the office. The certificate is not conclusive. The Court will decide upon an examination of all the facts.</p>\n<p id=\"b319-11\">The question then is, have the canvassers complied with the duties enjoined on them by law <em>1 </em>-I am clearly of opin\u2022ion they have not.</p>\n<p id=\"b319-13\">A certificate of the election in Niskayuna was signed by <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"324\">*324</page-number>all the inspectors, and one of their number appointed to deliver it to the clerk of the county. This was done within the time limited by law. When the board met to calculate the votes, the inspector from Niskayuna was excluded, on the ground that he did not produce written evidence of his appointment. The statute declares that one of the inspectors of election, who shall actually preside at such election, to be appointed by a major part of the inspectors who shall so preside, shall, in person, deliver to the clerk a copy of the statement of votes. It is then made the duty of the inspectors, who attend at the clerk\u2019s office, to ascertain the whole number of votes given for the respective candidates at the election.</p>\n<p id=\"b320-8\">The 10th section of the act does not require that one of the inspectors be appointed to preside at the election. All the inspectors attending equally preside, and have equal powers. The meaning of the act is, that some one of the inspectors, who have attended the election, shall bo appointed to deliver the certificate, and attend at th\u00e9 clerk\u2019s office of the county. It is not necessary to make this appointment until the votes of the town are canvassed.</p>\n<p id=\"b320-9\">Although an appointment by writing is to be preferred, it is not indispensible. The statute is silent as to a written appointment. If an objection is taken when an inspector presents himself at the board of canvassers, the evidence of his appointment may be either by writing or parol. If the statement of the votes of the town are delivered to the clerk by an inspector, and the fact of his being an inspector is not questioned by the canvassers, he ought not to be excluded ; for the delivery of the statement, and attendance to perform the duty of a canvasser, is <em>prima facie </em>evidence of an appointment for that purpose. The canvassers, therefore, erred in excluding the inspector from Niskayuna on his first application.</p>\n<p id=\"b320-10\">But if this were not sufficient, the certificate produced, before the hour of 4 o\u2019clock on the 12th of November, was evidence that the person producing it had been regularly appointed. The act gives the power of appointment to the major part of the inspectors who shall preside. The per<page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"325\">*325</page-number>son appointed is not excluded from participation ; and consequently he may constitute one of the majority who confef on him the appointment. A second certificate signed by all the inspectors was produced the next day, before the canvass was finished. The inspectors from Niskayuna attended personally ; and offered to make oath. The board then decided not to receive any evidence ; because not offered previous to 4 o\u2019clock P. M. of the day preceding. The votes of Niskayuna were not calculated. Ex-eluding that town, the defendant had a majority of votes, and was declared duly elected. If the votes of Niskayuna had been canvassed, the relator would have been found to be elected.</p>\n<p id=\"b321-15\">The several decisions of the board of canvassers arc manifestly erroneous ; and call for the interposition of this Court. The defendant was not duly elected sheriff; but unlawfully holds that office. It is the opinion of the Court that judgment of ouster be entered ; and that the relator recover his costs of prosecution.</p>\n<p id=\"b321-16\">Judgment of ouster.</p>\n</opinion>\n</casebody>\n",
