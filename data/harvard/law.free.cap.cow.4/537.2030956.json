The \u00b0 \u00b0 \u2019 plain tiff\u2019s attorney had made and served a case on the defendant\u2019s attorney, who had served the plaintiff\u2019s attorney with amendments, to which the plaintiff\u2019s attorney did not , . .., , . \u201e \u201e , ohject, nor did he give any notice of referring the case to <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"538\">*538</page-number>be settled by the Circuit Judge, who tried the cause.

He cited Rule 6, Jan. Term, 1799, and Rule of Jan. Term, 1816. Here, the party is in full possession of the case, without service of a copy. The case is within the reason of <em>Van Buskirk </em>v. <em>Burr, </em>(20 John. Rep. 275,) where the Court held, that demurrer books need not be served till the argument comes on. He also cited <em>Jackson </em>v. <em>Case, </em>(12 John. Rep. 431,) and relied on <em>Peck </em>v. <em>Peck, </em>(14 id. 219,) as showing that the rule, upon which the defendant\u2019s counsel applied, ivas confined to cases settled by the Judge.</p>\n<opinion data-order=\"7\" data-type=\"opinion\" id=\"x999-1\" type=\"majority\">\n<author id=\"b534-7\">\n<em>Curia.</em>\n</author>\n<p id=\"Akd\">There was, perhaps, some reason to suppose so from the authorities; but we think the practice should be the same, without regard to the manner of settling the case. This will preclude all disputes upon the argument as to the frame of it. The transcriber may mistake the precise import or place of the proposed amendment; but if the case be copied and served, at least as early as the notice of argument, it gives a fair chance for correction, before the cause is called upon the calendar. We deny this motion without costs; but in future, the course must be the same in regard to cases amended or settled by agreement, or by the lapse of time, as those settled by the Judge. In all these cases, they must be drawn out, copied and served at or before giving notice of argument.</p>\n<p id=\"b534-8\">Motion denied</p>\n</opinion>\n</casebody>\n",
