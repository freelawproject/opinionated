This order was served on the plaintiff\u2019s attorney on the 2d day of June last; previous to which he had forwarded to the defendants\u2019 attorney a notice of trial for the Ontario circuit, to be held on the 3d Monday of June. He contended that the application was too late; and cited <em>Delevan </em>v. Baldwin, (3 Caines\u2019 Rep. 104,) and <em>Kent </em>v. <em>Dodge, </em>(3 John. Rep. 447.)</p>\n<opinion data-order=\"5\" data-type=\"opinion\" id=\"x999-1\" type=\"majority\">\n<author id=\"b550-12\">Curia.</author>\n<p id=\"AUgz\">This motion might have been made at May term; instead of which, the defendant lies by, without excuse till the 25th of May. He then obtains an order to stay proceedings, which carries the plaintiff over the Ontario circuit, and produces the loss of a trial. If the defendant will wait till after issue joined, before he moves to change the venue, it behoves him to see that the plaintiff cannot lose a circuit by the delay. <em>(Kent </em>v. <em>Dodge, </em>8 John. 447.)</p>\n<p id=\"b550-13\">Motion denied.</p>\n</opinion>\n</casebody>\n",
