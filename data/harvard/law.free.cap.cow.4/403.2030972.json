We considered the alternative mandamus in the nature of a rule to show cause; that it might be served by showing the original, and delivering a copy in vacation. It follows, that the Judges might have made a return without the writ. We give them to the next term, at which time they are to make a return. The relator must then file the original writ.</p>\n<p id=\"b399-21\">Rule accordingly.</p>\n</opinion>\n</casebody>\n",
