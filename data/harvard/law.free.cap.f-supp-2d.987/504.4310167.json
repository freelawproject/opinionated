(D.1.371) For the reasons discussed below, the Court will deny the motion.</p>\n<p id=\"b546-8\">I. PROCEDURAL BACKGROUND</p>\n<p id=\"b546-9\">Avanir Pharmaceuticals, Inc., Avanir Holding Company, and Center for Neurologic Study (collectively, \u201cAvanir\u201d or \u201cPlaintiffs\u201d) filed this patent infringement action against Actavis South Atlantic LLC, Actavis, Inc., Par Pharmaceutical, Inc., Par Pharmaceutical Companies, Inc., Impax Laboratories, Inc., Wockhardt, Ltd., Wockhardt USA, LLC, Watson Pharmaceuticals, Inc., Watson Laborator\u00edes, Inc., and Watson Pharma, Inc. (collectively, \u201cDefendants\u201d) on August 10, 2011.<footnotemark>1</footnotemark> (D.I.l) There are three patents-in-suit. United States Patent No. RE38,115 (the \u201c \u2019115 patent\u201d) relates to formulations containing dextromethorphan (\u201cDM\u201d) and quinidine (\u201cQ\u201d),' the active ingredients of Avanir\u2019s Nuedexta\u00ae product. United States Patent Nos. 7,659,282 (the \u201c \u2019282 patent\u201d) and 8,227,484 (the <em>\u201c </em>\u2019484 patent\u201d) relate to the use of DM and Q for the treatment of a neurological disorder.</p>\n<p id=\"b546-12\">On August 5, 2013, Defendants filed a motion to dismiss Plaintiffs\u2019 claims arising under the \u2019115 patent. (D.I.371) After full briefing, the Court heard argument on this motion during the pretrial conference on September 3, 2013. A bench trial was then conducted from September 9 to September 13, with an additional day on October 15, 2013. During the September phase of the trial, both sides presented evidence relating to the motion to dismiss, particularly with respect to the prosecution history of the \u2019115 patent. After hearing that evidence, the Court ordered the parties to provide supplemental briefing relating to the motion to dismiss, briefing which the parties completed on September 30, 2013. <em>(See </em>D.I. 419 \u00b6 6; D.I. 420-26)</p>\n<p id=\"b546-13\">II. PROSECUTION HISTORY</p>\n<p id=\"b546-14\">The prosecution history related to the \u2019115 patent involves three interrelated lines of filings, consisting of (1) a series of original filings, (2) a series of Patent Cooperation Treaty (\u201cPCT\u201d) filings, and (3) a reissuance proceeding.</p>\n<p id=\"b546-15\">On June 9, 1992, Dr. Richard Smith filed U.S. Patent Application Serial No. 07/896,-053 (the \u201c \u2019053 application\u201d). (DTX 32 at AVAN-0403490) An examiner with the United States Patent and Trademark Of<page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"507\">*507</page-number>fice (\u201cPTO\u201d) issued a final office action for the \u2019053 application on April 28, 1993, which required a response within three months, by July 28, 2013. (DTX 32 at AVAN-0403617-18) On August 30, 1993, the applicant mailed a petition for a retroactive one-month extension for the \u2019053 application. (DTX 32 at AVAN-0403620) On that same date, the applicant also mailed a conditional express abandonment<footnotemark>2</footnotemark> of the \u2019053 application (DTX 32 at AVAN-0403619) as well as a continuation-in-part application (\u201cC-I-P\u201d) of the \u2019053 application <em>(see id.), </em>which became known as U.S. Patent Application Serial No. 08/114,845 (the \u201c\u2019845 application\u201d) (DTX 127 at AVAN-0316787). The PTO granted the one-month extension for the \u2019053 application up to August 30, 1993. (DTX 32 at AVAN-0403678) No further extensions were either sought or received. On December 8, 1993, the examiner issued a notice of abandonment of the \u2019053 application. (DTX 32 at AVAN-0403621) In the meantime, on September 3, 1993, the \u2019845 application was filed. (DTX 127 at AVAN-0316787)</p>\n<p id=\"b547-4\">On September 22, 1994, Drs. Richard Smith and Jonathan Licht filed PCT International Application No. PCT/US94/10771 (the \u201c\u2019771 application\u201d). (DTX 638 at AVAN-0207672-710) Subsequently, on September 19, 1996, Drs. Smith and Licht filed a U.S. national stage application of the \u2019771 application, known as U.S. Patent Application Serial No. 08/464,792 (the \u201c \u2019792 application\u201d). (DTX 179 at AVAN0207665) Neither the \u2019771 application <em>(see </em>DTX 638) nor the national stage \u2019792 application (see DTX 179 at AVAN-0207667) included priority claims to either the \u2019053 or \u2019845 applications.</p>\n<p id=\"b547-8\">On March 10, 1997, during prosecution of the \u2019792 application, the examiner rejected claims 1-4 as obvious under 35 U.S.C. \u00a7 103(a) over the Zhang 1992 reference.<footnotemark>3</footnotemark> (Id. at AVAN-0207773) In response, the applicants did not address the teachings of the Zhang 1992 reference, but instead attempted to claim priority back to the \u2019053 application, whose filing date predated the Zhang 1992 reference. (See <em>id. </em>at AVAN-0207864) Specifically, the applicants contended that the \u2019792 application enjoyed a continuous line of co-pendency back to the \u2019053 application through (i) the \u2019845 application and (ii) the \u2019771 application. <em>(Id.) </em>On December 19, 1997, the examiner mailed a notice of allowability of the \u2019792 application; no reason for the allowance was provided. <em>(See id. </em>at AVAN-0207874-77) On October 7, 1998, the examiner issued an examiner\u2019s amendment removing the \u2019053 and \u2019845 applications from the list of cross-referenced patent applications in the first paragraph of the specification of the \u2019792 application and replacing them with reference to the \u2019771 application. <em>(Id. </em>at AVAN-0207883-84) The \u2019792 application issued as U.S. Patent No. 5,863,927 (the \u201c \u2019927 patent\u201d) on January 26, 1999, without any priority claim to the \u2019053 or \u2019845 applications. (DTX 20)</p>\n<p id=\"b547-9\">On January 18, 2002, the applicants filed U.S. Patent Application Serial No. 10/052,-698 (the \u201c \u2019698 application\u201d) for reissuance of the \u2019927 patent. (DTX 180 at AVAN0209475-77) The applicants sought to claim <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"508\">*508</page-number>priority to the \u2019053 and \u2019845 applications. <em>(Id.) </em>The examiner issued the \u2019698 application as the \u2019115 patent without a reference to the \u2019053 and \u2019845 applications on the face of the patent; however, the \u2019053 and \u2019845 applications were listed in the first paragraph of the T15 patent specification. (DTX18)</p>\n<p id=\"b548-4\">During the present litigation, on March 26, 2013, Plaintiffs filed an ePetition to revive the \u2019053 application and correct what Defendants allege was a lack of copendency with the \u2019845 application. (D.I. 371 Ex. B; <em>see also </em>D.I. 397 at 3) Plaintiffs did not file a terminal disclaimer with the ePetition. <em>(See </em>D.I. 371 Ex. B) The ePetition was granted on the same date it was filed, March 26, 2013. <em>(Id. </em>at 4)</p>\n<p id=\"b548-5\">III. LEGAL STANDARDS</p>\n<p id=\"b548-6\">Federal Rule of Civil Procedure 12(b)(1) authorizes dismissal of a complaint for lack of jurisdiction over the subject matter. As the question of subject matter jurisdiction under Rule 12(b)(1) is not unique to patent law, it is governed by the law of the regional Circuit, here the Third Circuit. <em>See Toxgon Corp. v. BNFL, Inc., </em>312 F.3d 1379, 1380 (Fed.Cir.2002) (\u201cWe review a dismissal for lack of subject matter jurisdiction according to regional circuit law, since it is a procedural question not unique to patent law.\u201d).</p>\n<p id=\"b548-7\">Motions brought under Rule 12(b)(1) may present either a facial or factual challenge to the Court\u2019s subject matter jurisdiction. <em>See Gould Elec., Inc. v. United States, </em>220 F.3d 169, 176 (3d Cir.2000). In reviewing a factual challenge to the Court\u2019s subject matter jurisdiction, the Court is not confined to the allegations of the complaint, and the presumption of truthfulness does not attach to those allegations. <em>See Mortensen v. First Fed. Sav. &amp; Loan Ass\u2019n, </em>549 F.2d 884, 891 (3d Cir.1977). Instead, the Court may consider evidence outside the pleadings, including affidavits, depositions, and testimony, to resolve any factual issues bearing on jurisdiction. <em>See Gotha v. United States, </em>115 F.3d 176, 179 (3d Cir.1997). Once the Court\u2019s subject matter jurisdiction is challenged, the plaintiff bears the burden of proving jurisdiction exists. <em>See Mortensen, </em>549 F.2d at 891.</p>\n<p id=\"b548-11\">IV. DISCUSSION</p>\n<p id=\"b548-12\">Plaintiffs contend that the \u2019115 patent claims priority to June 9, 1992, the filing date of the \u2019053 application, through the \u2019845 application.<footnotemark>4</footnotemark> (D.I. 397 at 1-3) This priority claim is predicated on Plaintiffs\u2019 assertion that the \u2019053 and \u2019845 applications were co-pending. <em>See </em>35 U.S.C. \u00a7 120 (\u201cNo application shall be entitled to the benefit of an earlier filed application under this section unless an amendment containing the specific reference to the earlier filed application is submitted at such time during the pendency of the application.\u201d).<footnotemark>5</footnotemark> During the instant litigation, <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"509\">*509</page-number>however, Defendants advised Plaintiffs that, in Defendants\u2019 view, the \u2019053 application was abandoned three days before the \u2019845 application was filed, creating a gap in co-pendency. <em>(See </em>D.I. 423 at. 1; D.I. 423-1 Ex. A at 5 (Watson\u2019s Invalidity Contentions)) At least in part as a response to Defendants\u2019 contentions, on March 26, 2013 Plaintiffs filed an ePetition to revive the \u2019053 application and correct any lack of co-pendency. <em>(See </em>DTX 174; <em>see also </em>D.I. 397 at 3) In Defendants\u2019 view, the consequence of Plaintiffs\u2019 filing of the ePetition is that the \u2019115 patent retroactively expired on June 9, 2012 \u2014 rather than January 26, 2016, which Defendants agree was the \u2019115 patent\u2019s pre-ePetition expiration date (D.I. 371 at 2 n.l) \u2014 due to the terminal disclaimer Plaintiffs should have filed (but did not) under 37 C.F.R. \u00a7 1.137(d)(2). In other words, Defendants assert that, in exchange for revival of the abandoned '053 application, which would allow Plaintiffs to get behind certain prior art, Plaintiffs were required to dedicate the terminal period of their patent term to the public, via a terminal disclaimer. (D.I. 371 at 1) Plaintiffs\u2019 failure to file a terminal disclaimer should, Defendants continue, lead to dismissal of Plaintiffs\u2019 attempt to enforce the \u2019115 patent, \u2022 as the Court should \u201cequitably enforce the consequences of Plaintiffs\u2019 actions by declaring the \u2019115 patent expired and dismissing all related claims.\u201d (D.I. 409 at 10; <em>see also </em>D.I. 371 at 9) It follows, as Defendants see it, that the Court lacks subject matter jurisdietion to resolve issues relating to the infringement or validity of this patent.</p>\n<p id=\"b549-7\">Plaintiffs respond on multiple grounds. First, Plaintiffs contend that this Court is the wrong forum to address Defendants\u2019 contentions, as improper revival and prosecution irregularities are not grounds on which the Court may invalidate a patent. Next, Plaintiffs assert that there was no gap in co-pendency of the pertinent patent applications and, even if there were, the ePetition corrected any resulting problems. Plaintiffs further insist that no terminal disclaimer was required to accompany the ePetition. Finally, Plaintiffs contend that even if they are incorrect on each of the preceding points, Defendants are entitled to no relief, and especially not a judicial declaration that the \u2019115 patent is expired.</p>\n<p id=\"b549-8\">The Court considers each of these issues below.</p>\n<p id=\"b549-9\">A. Jurisdiction</p>\n<p id=\"b549-10\">As a threshold issue, the Court must determine if this Court is an appropriate forum to decide the issues Defendants have raised in their motion. Plaintiffs, relying on the Federal Circuit\u2019s decision in <em>Aristocrat Technologies Australia PTY Ltd. v. Int\u2019l Game Tech., </em>543 F.3d 657 (Fed.Cir.2008), assert that \u201cany determination of whether a terminal disclaimer was required is within the exclusive province of the PTO,\u201d so Defendants may only litigate their present contentions via a separate <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"510\">*510</page-number>action brought pursuant to the Administrative Procedure Act (\u201cAPA\u201d), 5 U.S.C. \u00a7 701 <em>et seq., </em>which would have to be filed against the PTO in the Eastern District of Virginia. (D.I. 420 at 6-7) Plaintiffs argue that \u201c[b]ecause <em>Aristocrat </em>unequivocally foreclosed the ability of a party to assert improper revival as a defense to patent infringement in the underlying infringement litigation, the only potential claim Defendants might assert to challenge the grant of the ePetition without a terminal disclaimer is an APA claim that the PTO\u2019s grant of the petition was arbitrary, capricious, an abuse of discretion, or otherwise not in accordance with law.\u201d (D.I. 420 at 7) (internal quotation marks omitted)</p>\n<p id=\"b550-4\">While <em>Aristocrat </em>holds that \u201cimproper revival may not be asserted as a defense in an action involving the validity or infringement of a patent,\u201d 543 F.3d at 663, Aristocrat did not consider a challenge to a court\u2019s subject matter jurisdiction.<footnotemark>6</footnotemark> That is, <em>Aristocrat </em>involved a validity challenge under Title 35 relying on improper revival as a defense to liability, not, as here, an issue as to the jurisdiction of a court to resolve disputes over patent priority and patent term, which is an issue arising under 28 U.S.C. \u00a7 1338(a). The fundamental initial question before the Court is whether this Court has jurisdiction, <em>not </em>(as in <em>Aristocrat </em>) whether the patent-in-suit is invalid because of \u201cimproper revival.\u201d Nothing in <em>Aristocrat </em>precludes this Court from deciding the jurisdictional question. More fundamentally, nothing in <em>Aristocrat </em>\u2014 nor any other authority to which the parties have cited \u2014 trumps the well-settled, general proposition that federal courts always possess the authority and obligation to examine their own jurisdiction over disputes brought before them. <em>See, e.g., Arbaugh v. Y &amp; H Corp., </em>546 U.S. 500, 514, 126 S.Ct. 1235, 163 L.Ed.2d 1097 (2006) (\u201c[Cjourts ... have an independent obligation to determine whether subject-matter jurisdiction exists, even in the absence of a challenge from any party\u201d).</p>\n<p id=\"b550-7\">Therefore, the Court will proceed to the next steps of the analysis.</p>\n<p id=\"b550-8\">B. Co-pendency</p>\n<p id=\"b550-9\">The Court must determine whether there was a lack of co-pendency between the \u2019053 application and the \u2019845 application. Having considered the evidence of record as well as the parties\u2019 arguments, including the trial testimony and extensive briefing, the Court finds that there was a three-day gap between the abandonment of the \u2019053 application and the filing of the \u2019845 application. Specifically, the \u2019053 application was abandoned on August 30, 1993, but the \u2019845 application was not filed until September 2, 1993. (D.I. 127 at <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"511\">*511</page-number>AVAN-0316787; <em>see also </em>D.I. 397 Ex. B at Par Pharma DEX 0014576)<footnotemark>7</footnotemark></p>\n<p id=\"b551-4\">Plaintiffs\u2019 own expert, Nicholas Godici, acknowledges the gap that occurred between the \u2019053 application\u2019s abandonment and the \u2019845 application\u2019s filing. (D.I. 409 Ex. A at 89 (stating that nothing in file history indicates that \u2019053 application had extension beyond August 30); <em>id. </em>at 81 (noting that \u2019845 application has September 2 filing date); Trial Tr. at 1006 (agreeing that \u2019845 application\u2019s filing date was September 2); <em>id. </em>at 1007 (agreeing generally that there would have been no need to file petition to revive \u2019053 application if it had been co-pending with \u2019845 application))</p>\n<p id=\"b551-5\">Plaintiffs offer several, unconvincing arguments for the purported existence of co-pendency. Plaintiffs contend that the \u201c \u2019053 application\u2019s abandonment was conditional upon the granting of the filing date for the \u2019845 application.\u201d (D.I. 420 at 3; <em>see also </em>D.I. 397 Ex. A at ParPharma DEX 0014480) While it seems clear from the prosecution history that the applicant <em>intended </em>that the \u2019053 application not be abandoned until after the \u2019845 application was filed, it is nonetheless the case that this is <em>not </em>what actually occurred. The undisputed evidence shows that, instead, the applicant prosecuted the \u2019053 application only until August 30, 1993. (DTX 32 at AVAN-0403678) Under these circumstances, the result is mandated by statute: \u201cUpon failure of the applicant to prosecute the application ... the application shall be regarded as abandoned.\u201d 35 U.S.C. \u00a7 133.</p>\n<p id=\"b551-6\">Plaintiffs next argue that \u201ceven if the conditional abandonment of the \u2019053 application was ineffective to initially establish co-pendency, the evidence shows that the PTO exercised its discretion to establish co-pendency and grant the \u2019845 application ... priority to the \u2019053 application.\u201d (D.I. 420 at 3; <em>see also </em>D.I. 422-1 Ex. K at AVAN-0316838 (examiner writing that \u2019053 and \u2019845 applications were co-pending)) Essentially, Plaintiffs contend that because the PTO considered the \u2019053 and \u2019845 applications to be co-pending during prosecution (before the ePetition was filed), it is improper for -the Court even to question the PTO\u2019s decision on this point. In making this argument, Plaintiffs rely again on <em>Aristocrat, </em>as well as <em>Magnivision, Inc. v. Bonneau Co., </em>115 F.3d 956 (Fed.Cir.1997), for the proposition that \u201c[ajbsent proof of inequitable conduct, the examiner\u2019s or the applicant\u2019s absolute compliance with the internal rules of patent examination becomes irrelevant after the patent has issued.\u201d <em>Aristocrat, </em>543 F.3d at 663 (citing <em>Magnivision, </em>115 F.3d at 960).</p>\n<p id=\"b551-9\">Again, however, Plaintiffs read too much into these decisions, which are predicated on the principle that \u201c[t]here is good reason not to permit procedural irregularities during prosecution, such as the one at issue here, to provide <em>a basis for invalidity.\u201d Aristocrat, </em>543 F.3d at 663 (emphasis added). The issue before this Court, however, is whether, even if the PTO did treat the \u2019053 and \u2019845 applications as co-pending, did co-pendency actually exist? This inquiry is statutorily demanded in determining the correct priority date; for any patent application claiming priority to an earlier application, co-pendency is required <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"512\">*512</page-number>under \u00a7 120. <em>Aristocrat </em>did not concern co-pending applications, and it did not address \u00a7 120. In the Court\u2019s view, <em>Aristocrat </em>does not prohibit a factual inquiry into the existence of statutorily required copendency.</p>\n<p id=\"b552-4\">Plaintiffs have cited no authority for the proposition that the PTO has \u201cdiscretionary authority\u201d to treat two applications as co-pending when, as a matter of fact, they were not co-pending.<footnotemark>8</footnotemark> Section 120 is written in absolute <em>terms </em>\u2014 \u201cNo <em>application </em>shall be entitled to the benefit of an earlier filed application under this section <em>unless </em>an amendment containing the specific reference to the earlier filed application is submitted at such time <em>during the pendency of the application </em>\u2014 which does not suggest the PTO has such discretion. Even if the PTO has such discretion and exercises it, Plaintiffs have cited no authority for the proposition that a Court faced with determining the proper priority date of a patent-in-suit cannot, nonetheless, consider what may be the actual facts with respect to the non-existence of copendency of two applications.</p>\n<p id=\"b552-9\">Plaintiffs contend that the issuance of the \u2019115 reissue patent, in which Plaintiffs successfully added the \u2019053 and \u2019845 applications to the language of the specification under \u201cRelated Applications\u201d (D.I. 422 Ex E at 1), is dispositive of co-pendency.<footnotemark>9</footnotemark> (D.I. 422 at 8) But Plaintiffs point to no authority for the proposition that a patent applicant or the PTO can cure a lack of co-pendency through prosecution of a reissue.<footnotemark>10</footnotemark> During reissue proceedings, the statutory requirement of \u00a7 120 remains \u2014 and, here, it was not satisfied.</p>\n<p id=\"b553-3\"><page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"513\">*513</page-number>Hence, the Court finds, based on the evidence, most of which is undisputed, that there was a lack of co-pendency of the \u2019053 and \u2019845 applications.</p>\n<p id=\"b553-4\">C. Terminal Disclaimer</p>\n<p id=\"b553-5\">Because there was a lack of copendency, and the \u2019053 application. was abandoned, the Court must next consider Plaintiffs\u2019 attempt to revive that application. Plaintiffs filed a petition to revive; however, Plaintiffs did not include a terminal disclaimer with their petition. The Court agrees with Defendants that, under the circumstances here, a grantable petition to revive would have to be accompanied by a terminal disclaimer.</p>\n<p id=\"b553-6\">On March 26, 2013, Plaintiffs filed an ePetition, which sought to claim priority for the \u2019115 patent back to a revived \u2019053 application. (D.I. 371 Ex. B at 3) To determine whether this ePetition required a terminal disclaimer, the Court must apply 37 C.F.R. \u00a7 1.137(d)(1) <em>&amp; </em>(2),<footnotemark>11</footnotemark> which provides (with emphasis added):</p>\n<blockquote id=\"b553-7\">Terminal disclaimer. (1 <em>)Any petition to revive pursuant to this section </em>in either a utility or plant <em>application filed before June 8, 1995, must be accompanied by a terminal disclaimer </em>and fee as set forth in \u00a7 1.321 dedicating to the public a terminal part of the term of any patent granted thereon equivalent to the lesser of: (i) The period of abandonment of the application; or (ii) The period extending beyond twenty years from the date on which the application for the patent was filed in the United States ... (2) Any <em>terminal disclaimer pursuant to parayraph (d)(1) </em>of this section <em>must also apply to any patent yranted on a </em>continuing utility or plant <em>application filed before June 8, 1995, </em>or a continuing design application, that contains a <em>speci\u00f1c reference under 35 U.S.C. 120, </em>121, or 365(c) to the application for which revival is sought.</blockquote>\n<p id=\"b553-11\">Section 1.137(d)(1) &amp; (2) required a terminal disclaimer to be filed with the ePetition. With regard to the conditions set out in paragraph (d)(1), (i) Plaintiffs submitted a petition to revive pursuant to \u00a7 1.137 (D.I. 371 Ex. B) and (ii) the utility application being revived, the \u2019053 application, was'filed on June 9, 1992, predating June 8, 1995. Accordingly, to be grantable, the petition to revive the \u2019053 application required a terminal disclaimer. <em>(See </em>37 C.F.R. \u00a7 1.137(b); <em>see also </em>Trial Tr. at 958-60)<footnotemark>12</footnotemark> With regard to the conditions set out in paragraph (d)(2), (i) the \u2019115 patent was a patent granted from a continuing utility .application; (ii) the T15 patent was filed on September 22, 1994,<footnotemark>13</footnotemark> predating June 8, 1995; and (iii) the \u2019115 patent contains a specific reference under 35 U.S.C. \u00a7 120 to the \u2019053 application, <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"514\">*514</page-number>which is the application for which revival is sought. (D.I. 371 Ex. F at ParPharma DEX 0016590-91) It follows that in order for the petition to revive the \u2019053 application to be grantable, the terminal disclaimer required pursuant to (d)(1) \u201cmust also apply\u201d pursuant to (d)(2) to the T15 patent. <em>{See </em>37 C.F.R. \u00a7 1.37(b); <em>see also </em>Trial Tr. at 960-63)<footnotemark>14</footnotemark></p>\n<p id=\"AO1P\">Plaintiffs\u2019 arguments against this conclusion are unavailing. Plaintiffs contend that the T15 patent does not come within the scope of \u00a7 1.137(d)(2) because it is a reissue application and the reissue application\u2019s actual filing date is after June 8, 1995. (D.I. 422 at 5) However, the statute provides that \u201cevery reissue patent shall have the same effect and operation in law\u201d as the original patent and, further, \u201cshall constitute a continuation thereof and have effect continuously from the date of the original patent.\u201d 35 U.S.C. \u00a7 252. Plaintiffs cite no authority to contradict the logical conclusion from this statutory language that a resissue application is, indeed, a \u201ccontinuing ... application\u201d within the meaning of \u00a7 1.137(d)(2). Hence, the \u2019115 resissue patent is, for these purposes, a continuation of the \u2019927 patent, which is traced back to the \u2019771 application, which was filed before June 8, 1995, on September 22, 1994. It follows that Plaintiffs\u2019 contention that the applicable application date is January 18, 2002 (D.I. 422 at 5) \u2014 the filing date of the \u2019698 reissue application \u2014 is incorrect.<footnotemark>15</footnotemark></p>\n<p id=\"b554-7\">Plaintiffs argue no terminal disclaimer was required because the \u2019053 application never issued as a patent and, therefore, the rationale behind terminal disclaimers does not apply, because there is no improper extension of the \u2019053 patent term. (D.I. 397 at 11) As an initial matter, Plaintiffs cite no authority for what they purport to be the rationale for the terminal disclaimer requirement.<footnotemark>16</footnotemark> Further, Plaintiffs\u2019 contention is inapposite: the term at issue is the term of the \u2019115 patent, as affected by paragraph (d)(2), not the term of any patent that issued from the \u2019053 application (which would be the subject of paragraph (d)(1)). In any event, to the <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"515\">*515</page-number>extent Plaintiffs axe correct that \u201cthe purpose of a terminal disclaimer is to prevent a patentee from improperly extending its monopoly over patented subject matter\u201d <em>(id.), </em>here that rationale <em>favors </em>requiring a terminal disclaimer, as without a disclaimer the T15 patent would enjoy a priority date stretching back to June 1992 yet would still retain its full term until January 2016.</p>\n<p id=\"b555-4\">Plaintiffs also suggest that if a terminal disclaimer were required, the PTO would have rejected their ePetition, so the PTO\u2019s acceptance of the ePetition indicates that no terminal disclaimer was necessary. <em>(See id. </em>at 5) This contention overlooks the undisputed evidence that the PTO\u2019s automated system automatically granted the ePetition based on Plaintiffs\u2019 checking a box indicating <em>Plaintiffs\u2019 </em>position that a \u201c[tjerminal disclaimer and fee are not required\u201d (DTX 32 at AVAN-0403496), without any independent evaluation of the merits of that position by anyone (or even by any computer) <em>(see </em>DTX 592; D.I. 409 Ex. C at \u00b6 12 (stating PTO automatically grants ePetition \u201c[ojnce all of the items are correctly filled out,\u201d without undertaking review on the merits); Trial Tr. at 963-64).</p>\n<p id=\"b555-5\">In sum, in order to be properly granted, Plaintiffs\u2019 ePetition was required to include a terminal disclaimer, which would have dedicated to the public any portion of the \u2019115 patent\u2019s term extending beyond June 9, 2012.<footnotemark>17</footnotemark> It is undisputed that Plaintiffs failed to include such a terminal disclaimer with their March 2013 ePetition.</p>\n<p id=\"b555-8\">D. Remedy</p>\n<p id=\"b555-9\">Having determined that Plaintiffs\u2019 ePetition was required to be accompanied by a terminal disclaimer, which would have resulted in the \u2019115 patent\u2019s expiration, and it being undisputed that Plaintiffs did not file a terminal disclaimer, the Court next confronts the difficult matter of .discerning the appropriate consequences. Defendants request that the Court either require Plaintiffs to return to the PTO and file a petition accompanied by the necessary terminal disclaimer or, alternatively, simply find that the \u2019115 patent is expired. (D.I. 421 at 8-9) Plaintiffs, understandably, oppose both of these proposed remedies. Plaintiffs observe that, had the PTO determined that the March 2013 ePetition required a terminal disclaimer, the PTO\u2019s response would have been to dismiss the petition and provide Plaintiffs the <em>option </em>to refile. (D.I. 397 at 1; <em>see also </em>Trial Tr. at 994 (testimony of Plaintiffs\u2019 expert, Mr. Godici)) Defendants appear to agree that this is what would have occurred.</p>\n<p id=\"b555-10\">It follows, in the Court\u2019s view, that Plaintiffs should not be left with something less than they would have had if the PTO had reviewed the ePetition on its merits and determined that a terminal disclaimer was required. Defendants cite no authority for the proposition that the Court is obligated to order Plaintiffs to refile th\u00e9ir petition with a terminal disclaimer or to <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"516\">*516</page-number>declare the \u2019115 patent expired. Nor do Defendants make a convincing case for the Court exercising whatever equitable discretion it has to accomplish such a result.</p>\n<p id=\"b556-4\">Unfortunately, Plaintiffs\u2019 proposed \u201cremedy\u201d is untenable as well. Plaintiffs ask the Court to do nothing, allowing them to retain the \u2019115 patent\u2019s term until January 26, 2016 while also obtaining a priority date back to June 9, 1992. <em>(See </em>D.I. 422 at 10) For this conclusion, Plaintiffs rely again on <em>Aristocrat, </em>but again their position is unavailing. In <em>Aristocrat, </em>the defendants sought to invalidate the \u2019215 patent, contending the original \u2019215 application was abandoned by an improperly granted petition to revive and that this, alone, was sufficient grounds for a defense of invalidity. <em>See </em>543 F.3d at 660.<footnotemark>18</footnotemark> Indeed, since the \u2019215 patent relied on only a single application, the defendants\u2019 improper revival argument, if accepted, would have eliminated the only basis for the \u2019215 patent\u2019s existence. <em>See id. </em>Here, by contrast, the Court\u2019s finding of abandonment of the \u2019053 application simply affects the priority date; it does not itself directly form the grounds for \u201ca defense that the patent is invalid.\u201d The prosecution history here is far more complicated than the history in <em>Aristocrat </em>and, here, there are several other applications to which Plaintiffs can claim priority.<footnotemark>19</footnotemark></p>\n<p id=\"b556-8\"><em>Aristocrat </em>is further distinguishable on other grounds as well. In reaching its holding in <em>Aristocrat, </em>the Federal Circuit observed that improper revival is not a defense that is found either in \u00a7 282 or elsewhere in the Patent Act. The Court further reasoned that it could reject recognition of the proposed improper revival defense because it did not, in <em>Aristocrat, </em>confront a situation in which the \u201cfailure to impose invalidity for violation of the statute would encourage noncompliance.\u201d 543 F.3d at 664. The Court could \u201cdiscern no legitimate incentive for a patent applicant to intentionally abandon its application, much less to attempt to persuade the PTO to improperly revive it.\u201d <em>Id. </em>Specifically, the Court concluded that because \u201cpatents filed <em>after enactment of the Uruguay Round Agreements Act [\u201cGATT\u201d</em><footnotemark><em>20</em></footnotemark><em>], like the patents at issue here, </em>generally have a term that runs twenty years from the <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"517\">*517</page-number>filing date (instead of seventeen years from issue) ... abandoning the application would only serve to shorten the applicant\u2019s right to exclude.\u201d <em>Id. </em>(emphasis added).</p>\n<p id=\"b557-4\">Here, by contrast, the \u2019115 patent relates to a <em>pre-GATT f\u00edling, </em>giving rise to a situation in which the disincentives present in <em>Aristocrat </em>do not exist. Instead, under the circumstance here, an applicant receives a term <em>of </em>17 years <em>from issuance. </em>Because the patent term is not governed by the filing date, the patent term \u201cclock\u201d does not start \u201cticking\u201d during prosecution, which provides an opportunity for an applicant to abandon the application and stretch out prosecution without consequences for the patent term. In turn, the automated ePetition process provides an opportunity for the applicant to revive the application to obtain an earlier priority date from an abandoned application and simply check the \u201cterminal disclaimer not required\u201d box to avoid dedicating a terminal part of the patent term to the public. The result is, as the present case illustrates, that an applicant may 'stretch back the priority date to avoid prior art while keeping a full patent term. Thus, unlike the post-GATT filings involved in <em>Aristocrat, </em>abandonment of a pre-GATT filing in no way \u201cshorten[s] the applicant\u2019s right to <em>exclude\u201d </em>\u2014 unless a terminal disclaimer is required. Hence, under the circumstances here, a failure to enforce the terminal disclaimer requirement <em>would </em>encourage noncompliance with prosecution procedures.</p>\n<p id=\"b557-7\">Additionally, here, unlike what was attempted by the defendants in <em>Aristocrat, </em>the Court is not permitting Defendants to argue that improper revival, or any other prosecution irregularity, invalidates the \u2019115 patent. Instead, under the circumstances here, the Court is faced with issues relating to the determination of a priority date, and the Court\u2019s resolution of the parties\u2019 dispute does not mandate invalidation of the patent. Therefore, the Court is not permitting \u201cprocedural irregularities ... to provide a basis for invalidity,\u201d <em>Aristocrat, 543 F.3d </em>at <em>663; </em>instead, the Court is considering the entirety of the prosecution history for purposes of determining the correct priority date for a patent-in-suit.<footnotemark>21</footnotemark></p>\n<p id=\"b557-8\">Having rejected both parties\u2019 positions with respect to an appropriate remedy, the Court must determine what to do. The resolution to this question begins from the premise that had the PTO dismissed the ePetition, while the \u2019115 patent would not expire until January 26, 2016, the \u2019115 patent also would not claim priority to the \u2019053 application filing date; rather, the \u2019115 patent could only claim priority to the \u2019845 application, which was filed on September 2,1993 and was not abandoned. Under the circumstances, the Court concludes that the \u2019115 patent may either (i) claim priority back to June 9, 1992\u2014 <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"518\">*518</page-number>the \u2019053 application\u2019s filing date \u2014 and then its terminal period must be disclaimed, pursuant to \u00a7 1.137(d)(2), meaning the \u2019115 patent would have expired on June 9, 2012; or (ii) claim priority to September 2, 1993 \u2014 the \u2019845 application\u2019s filing date\u2014 and would not expire until the end of its full term, on January 26, 2016.<footnotemark>22</footnotemark> Plaintiffs, then, have options, and the Court sees no reason to foreclose Plaintiffs from making an election to pursue whichever is their preferred option.</p>\n<p id=\"b558-4\">Accordingly, the Court concludes that Plaintiffs\u2019 ePetition to revive the abandoned \u2019053 application was inoperative,<footnotemark>23</footnotemark> due to Plaintiffs\u2019 failure to comply with the terminal disclaimer requirements of 37 C.F.R. \u00a7 1.137(d)(1) &amp; (2). In turn, the \u2019053 application remains abandoned and, pursuant to 35 U.S.C. \u00a7 120, Plaintiffs cannot claim its priority date. At present, the \u2019115 patent can only claim priority back to the \u2019845 application\u2019s filing date, which is September 2,1993. Alternatively, Plaintiffs may seek to refile their petition to revive the \u2019053 application, accompanied this time by the required terminal disclaimer, which would result in an earlier priority date as well as an earlier expiration date.</p>\n<p id=\"b558-5\">At this point, the \u2019115 patent continues to enjoy a presumption of validity, <em>see </em>35 U.S.C. \u00a7 282; <em>Cardinal Chem. Co. v. Morton Int\u2019l, Inc., </em>508 U.S. 83, 93 n. 15, 113 S.Ct. 1967, 124 L.Ed.2d 1 (1993), and has not been determined by either the PTO or this Court to have expired. It follows that the Court continues to have subject matter jurisdiction over the parties\u2019 disputes relating to the 115 patent. Accordingly, the Court will deny Defendants\u2019 motion to dismiss.</p>\n<p id=\"b558-11\">y.

There is no material difference, for the purposes of the issues before the Court, between the 1993 version of the statute and the current version. The parties evidently agree on this point, as they do not address the fact that the statute has been amended. Indeed, even Plaintiffs acknowledge that \u00a7 120 <em>\u201crequires that an application claiming the benefit of an earlier filing date be co-pending with the parent application.\u201d </em>(D.I. 422 at 8) (emphasis in original)</p>\n</footnote>\n<footnote label=\"6\">\n<p id=\"b550-5\">.

As noted earlier, the PTO issued the final office action on the \u2019053 application on April 28, 1993, requiring a response within three months. (DTX 32 at AVAN-0403617-18) On August 30, 1993, the applicant filed a petition for a one-month extension (DTX 32 at AVAN0403620), which the PTO granted, keeping the \u2019053 application alive until August 30, 1993 (DTX 32 at AVAN-0403678). No additional extensions were sought or received. The \u2019845 application was filed three days later, on September 2, 1993.

To the extent that Plaintiffs suggest the prosecution of the '792 application cured any lack of co-pendency between the '053 and '845 applications <em>(see, e.g., </em>D.I. 397 at 8-9), this is incorrect, for reasons including that the '792 application could not claim priority to the '053 or '845 applications. <em>(See </em>Trial Tr. at 954-55 (testimony of Defendant\u2019s expert, Mr. Carmichael)) MPEP \u00a7 1893.03(c) states that for \u201ca national stage application (of international application 'X') to obtain benefit under 35 U.S.C. \u00a7 120 of a prior U.S. national application, the international application ('X') must include an appropriate reference in the Request to the prior U.S. national application.\u201d MPEP \u00a7 1893.03(c) (6th ed\u201e Rev.3, July 1997). The '771 application \u2014 the international parent of the national stage '792 application \u2014 made no reference to the '053 or '845 applications.

As a factual matter, it is unclear whether the PTO analyzed either co-pendency or priority during the '115 reissuance proceedings. In their reissue application, the applicants sought to amend the specification to add language about the '053 and '845 applications and allow a priority claim to them. <em>(See </em>DTX 180; Trial Tr. at 955) The PTO accepted the change to the specification\u2019s language; however, the PTO appears never to have conducted any review of the '053 and '845 applications which formed the basis for the applicants' change in priority. Indeed, the examiner did not check the box indicating acknowledgment of the priority claim (DTX 180 at AVAN-0209537); the Bib Data Sheet for cross-checking of continuity data shows no priority claims to these applications <em>(id. </em>at AVAN-0209507); and there is no priority claim to the \u2019053 or \u2019845 applications on the face of the \u2019115 patent (D.1.426-1).

Section 1.137(d)(3) provides, \u201cThe provisions of paragraph (d)(1) of this section do not apply to applications for which revival is sought solely for purposes of co-pendency with a utility or plant application filed on or after June 8, 1995, to lapsed patents, to reissue applications, or to reexamination proceedings.\u201d None of these exceptions applies here: the '053 application was filed before June 8, 1995 and is not a reissue application, and no lapsed patents or reexamination proceedings are involved here.</p>\n</footnote>\n<footnote label=\"13\">\n<p id=\"b553-13\">.The filing date of the T15 patent is the filing date of the international PCT parent application (the '771 application), which is September 22, 1994. <em>See </em>35 U.S.C. \u00a7 252 (resissue is continuation of original patent); D.I. 371 Ex. A at P\u00e1rPharma DEX 0014599; D.I. 409 Ex. C at \u00b6\u00b6 15-16 (stating that application leading to '927 patent \u2014 and, ultimately, '115 patent \u2014 has filing date of September 22, 1994)</p>\n</footnote>\n<footnote label=\"14\">\n<p id=\"b554-4\">. Plaintiffs argue that no patent ever issued from the '053 application, so there is no patent term to disclaim under paragraph (d)(1), and therefore no terminal disclaimer is required under paragraph (d)(2) with respect to the '115 patent. (See D.I. 397 at 10) This is not convincing. Because the conditions of (d)(1) are satisfied' \u2014 even though no term of the \u2019053 application, which is only an application, can be disclaimed \u2014 (d)(2) requires a further examination to identify any other patents to which the same terminal disclaimer \u201cmust also apply.\u201d Here, that includes the '115 patent.</p>\n</footnote>\n<footnote label=\"15\">\n<p id=\"b554-5\">. Plaintiffs further argue that \"the relevant filing date for purposes of 37 CFR \u00a7 1.137(d)(2) is the actual filing date, rather than the effective date.\u201d (D.I. 422 at 5) However, Plaintiffs\u2019 argument again presupposes that the relevant date is calculated from the <em>reissue application, </em>rather than from the <em>original patent. </em>As explained above, given the statutory relationship between the original patent and its reissue, the filing date of the '115 reissue application is irrelevant to the analysis. It is the original patent's critical date that governs. Whether the actual filing date of the original '927 patent is used (September 22, 1994) or that patent's effective date (alleged by Plaintiffs to be June 9, 1992) is immaterial here, as both are before June 8, 1995.</p>\n</footnote>\n<footnote label=\"16\">\n<p id=\"b554-9\">.The Court has found little discussion of the rationale for a terminal disclaimer, and none arising in circumstances similar to those presented here.
