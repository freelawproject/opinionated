This Multi District Litigation (MDL) currently consists of First and Second Wave Cases. The \"First Wave Cases\u201d are: <em>Fujifilm Corp. v. Papst, </em>07-cv-1118; <em>Matsushita Elec. Indus. Co., Ltd. v. Papst, </em>07-cv-1222; <em>Papst v. Olympus Corp., </em>07-cv-2086; <em>Papst v. Samsung Techwin Co., </em>07-cv-2088; <em>Hewlett-Packard Co. v. Papst, </em>08-cv-865; and <em>Papst v. Nikon Corp., </em>08-cv-985. The \"Second Wave Cases\u201d currently are: <em>Papst v. Canon, </em>08-cv-1406; and <em>Papst v. Sanyo, </em>09-cv-530. The Camera Manufacturers (CMs) seeking summary judgment here are parties in the First Wave Cases; they are: Fujifilm Corporation; Fujifilm U.S.A., Inc.; Fujifilm Japan; Panasonic Corporation (f/k/a as Matsushita Electric Industrial Co., Ltd.); Victor Company of Japan, Ltd.; Olympus Corporation; Olympus Imaging America Inc.; Samsung Techwin Co., Ltd.; Samsung Opto-Electronics America, Inc.; Panasonic Corporation of North America; JVC Company of America; 'Hewlett-Packard Company (HP); Nikon Corporation; and Nikon, Inc.</p>\n</footnote>\n<footnote label=\"2\">\n<p id=\"Af0\">. This motion is one of eight filed by the Camera Manufacturers. In the interest of timely disposition, the Court does not recite the full background and assumes familiarity with its prior rulings. <em>See, e.g., </em>Claims Constr. Op. [Dkt. 336]; Sanctions Op. [Dkt. 429],</p>\n</footnote>\n<footnote label=\"3\">\n<p id=\"Atx\">. The Court construed \"second connecting device\u201d in the 399 Patent to mean \"a physical plug or socket for permitting a user readily to attach and detach the interface device with a plurality of dissimilar data transmit/receive devices, including a sampling circuit for sampling the analog data provided by the data transmit/receive device and an analog-to-digital converter for converting data sampled by the sampling circuit into digital data,\u201d and in the 449 Patent to mean \"a physical plug or socket for permitting a user readily to attach and detach the interface device with a plurality of dissimilar data transmit/receive devices.\u201d <em>See </em>Claims Constr. Op. [Dkt. 336] at 40.</p>\n</footnote>\n<footnote label=\"4\">\n<p id=\"b97-12\">.Papst agrees, however, that some products do not infringe the 399 Patent because they do not meet the \"analog data\u201d requirement. <em>See </em>Opp'n [Dkt. 478] at 2 (\"[Accessories which in fact produce signals that are digital only would not by themselves lead to infringement of the 399 patent\u201d); <em>id. </em>at 4 (\"Papst agrees that if in fact an accused product does not receive analog data from any external accessory, then it does not infringe the 399 patent under the Court's claims construction.\u201d); <em>id. </em>at 15 (\"cameras that receive <em>only </em>digital data from the [data transmit/receive devices] do not infringe the 399 Patent....\"); <em>see also </em>Opp\u2019n to HP's Mot. Summ. J. [Dkt. 470] at 25 (accused cameras-that receive digital data, and not analog data, from memory cards and USB connectors do not infringe the 399 Patent).</p>\n</footnote>\n<footnote label=\"5\">\n<p id=\"b98-11\">. Because Papst\u2019s motion for additional discovery [Dkt. 479] was addressed in each of the summary judgment rulings cited in this Opinion, the motion now has been adjudicated in full.</p>\n</footnote>\n<footnote label=\"6\">\n<p id=\"b98-12\">. Papst moved to file a surreply, as it has with every motion for summary judgment. <em>See </em>Mot. for Leave to File Surreply [Dkt. 517]. Because the Camera Manufacturers' reply brief did not raise new issues and because surreplies are disfavored in this district, the motion to file a surreply will be denied. <em>See Crummey v. Social Sec. Admin., </em>794 F.Supp.2d 46, 62 (D.D.C.2011).</p>\n</footnote>\n</opinion>\n</casebody>\n",
