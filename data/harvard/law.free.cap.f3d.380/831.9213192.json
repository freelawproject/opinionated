Rueda contests the merits of the IJ\u2019s determination that he was statutorily ineligible for cancellation of removal because he failed to demonstrate the requisite hardship.</p>\n<p id=\"b855-20\">Because this case involves the granting of relief under 8 U.S.C. \u00a7 1229b(b), the jurisdictional bar of 8 U.S.C. \u00a7 1252(a)(2)(B)\u00a9<footnotemark>1</footnotemark> is implicated. <em>See Garcia-Melendez v. Ashcroft, </em>351 F.3d 657, 661 (5th Cir.2003). This provision strips us of jurisdiction over those decisions that involve the exercise of discretion. <em>Mi-reles-Valdez v. Ashcroft, </em>349 F.3d 213, 216 (5th Cir.2003). The IJ\u2019s determination under \u00a7 1229b(b)(l)(D) that Rueda\u2019s children would not suffer an \u201cexceptional and extremely unusual hardship\u201d if Rueda were deported to Mexico involved the exercise of discretion. <em>See, e.g., Mendez-Moran-chel v. Ashcroft, </em>338 F.3d 176, 179 (3d Cir.2003) (holding that \u201c[t]he decision whether an alien meets the hardship requirement in 8 U.S.C. \u00a7 1229b is ... a discretionary judgment\u201d); <em>cf. Moosa v. INS, </em>171 F.3d 994, 1012 (5th Cir.1999) (holding, under the predecessor to \u00a7 1229b(b), \u201cthat denials of suspension based on the ... element of \u2018extreme hardship\u2019 are discretionary decisions\u201d). Therefore, this court lacks jurisdiction to review the IJ\u2019s hardship determination, and Rueda\u2019s petition is DISMISSED. <em>See Mendez-Moranchel, </em>338 F.3d at 179.</p>\n<footnote label=\"1\">\n<p id=\"b855-17\">. As we have previously explained, the judicial review provisions codified in \u00a7 1252(a)(2) apply to removal proceedings, like Rueda\u2019s, that commenced after April 1, 1997. <em>See, e.g., DeLeon-Holguin v. Ashcroft, </em>253 F.3d 811, 813 (5th Cir.2001).</p>\n</footnote>\n</opinion>\n</casebody>\n",
