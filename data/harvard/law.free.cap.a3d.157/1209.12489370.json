On appeal, the defendant claims that (1) the trial court erred in permitting joinder of one information charging murder with a second information charging a separate instance of criminal possession; and (2) this court should adopt a \"clear failure of judicial obligation\" standard for conducting a harmless error analysis under the facts of this case.\n   <footnotemark>\n    1\n   </footnotemark>\n   We affirm the judgment of the trial court.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-10\">\n   The jury reasonably could have found the following facts.\n   <footnotemark>\n    2\n   </footnotemark>\n   For some time preceding the murder of the victim, Michael Taylor, the defendant and the victim had been involved in an ongoing dispute. Additionally, approximately one week prior to the murder, the defendant told a lifelong friend, Everett Walker, that he wanted to kill the victim. Indeed, the victim knew that the defendant intended to harm him because he had told Walker, also a lifelong friend, that the defendant was \"out to get me,\" and the victim was so nervous that he sat on his porch armed with knives.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-11\">\n   Early in the morning on July 26, 2011, T.M.\n   <footnotemark>\n    3\n   </footnotemark>\n   was driving with his cousin, Desmond\n   Wray, around the north end of Hartford selling drugs when the defendant flagged him down on Enfield Street and asked to buy crack. At first, T.M. did not recognize the defendant, whom he had known since childhood and spent time with earlier the same month, because the defendant was wearing a disguise comprised of a fake beard drawn\n   on with a marker and a shirt over his head, as well as utilizing crutches. At the same time, the defendant engaged the victim, who was nearby, in a discussion, looking to buy marijuana from him. After the defendant crossed the street to approach the victim, the defendant shot the victim in the face, resulting in his death.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-12\">\n   Thereafter, the defendant got into the back of T.M.'s car and told him to drive to Earle Street in Hartford. Once the defendant was in the car and began removing his disguise, T.M. recognized him as the defendant. T.M. took the defendant to Earle Street and the defendant exited the car.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-13\">\n   At approximately 3 a.m. on July 26, 2011, the defendant arrived at the apartment of another childhood friend, Latia Avril, at 31 Owen Street in Hartford. During his visit, the defendant showed Avril a black gun, and how to open and fire it. Later that evening while the defendant was still there, police officers knocked on Avril's door to serve a warrant for the defendant's arrest for unrelated offenses. The defendant threw a .38 caliber revolver into a clothes hamper and attempted to escape through a bedroom window, but police officers, who were waiting outside the window, apprehended him. As the police officers escorted him to their vehicle, he stated, \"that gun I used it's not here, it's on Enfield Street.\"\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-14\">\n   Meanwhile, Avril went to the door and police officers entered the apartment. Avril indicated to police that the defendant had thrown something in a clothes hamper in a bedroom closet. In the clothes hamper, police located a .38 caliber Smith &amp; Wesson revolver with a five round capacity, but it contained only four cartridges when retrieved.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-15\">\n   The victim died from a single bullet wound under his left eye. Upon entry, the .38 caliber bullet shattered. The medical examiner recovered two fragments from\n   the victim's skull. The state's ballistics expert could not make a positive match of the bullet fragments recovered from the victim to those test-fired from the revolver recovered from Avril's apartment, but one of the fragments possessed rifling characteristics consistent with that revolver. Accordingly, the expert could not eliminate or identify the weapon seized as the weapon used in the victim's murder.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-16\">\n   On October 28, 2013, in a long form information, the state charged the defendant with murder and criminal possession in violation of the aforementioned statutes, as well as attempt to tamper with a witness in violation of General Statutes \u00a7\u00a7 53a-151 (a) and 53a-49. The criminal possession charge arose from the defendant's possession of the revolver at Avril's apartment. Originally, the state had charged the defendant with the three offenses in three separate informations, but the state moved to join the informations on October 28, 2013, the day that jury selection began. That day, the defendant orally objected to the consolidation on the grounds that the tampering and criminal possession charges were not cross admissible in the murder case. The court granted the motion for joinder, finding that the\n   tampering and criminal possession charges were cross admissible in the murder case and that the defendant was not prejudiced under the factors established in\n   <em>\n    State\n   </em>\n   v.\n   <em>\n    Boscarino,\n   </em>\n   <extracted-citation case-ids=\"501389\" index=\"0\" url=\"https://cite.case.law/conn/204/714/#p722\">\n    204 Conn. 714\n   </extracted-citation>\n   , 722-24,\n   <extracted-citation index=\"1\" url=\"https://cite.case.law/citations/?q=529%20A.2d%201260\">\n    529 A.2d 1260\n   </extracted-citation>\n   (1987). Following a jury trial, the jury returned a verdict of guilty on the murder and criminal possession charges and not guilty on the tampering charge. The court accepted the jury's verdict and, on January 27, 2014, sentenced the defendant to fifty-four years incarceration on the murder count and five years on the criminal possession count, to be served consecutively. This appeal followed.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-17\">\n   The defendant claims on appeal that the court erred in permitting joinder of one information charging murder\n   with a second information charging criminal possession. Specifically, the defendant argues that the court failed to consider whether the murder allegations were significantly more shocking and brutal than the allegations in the criminal possession case. Additionally, he asserts that the state did not attempt to meet its burden of proving that the evidence from the murder case would be admissible in a separate trial for criminal possession, or that the defendant would not be unreasonably prejudiced by the disparity in the egregiousness of the conduct supporting each charge. The state counters that the defendant did not raise this issue in his objection to the joinder of these charges, thereby either waiving or failing to preserve this claim for appeal. We agree with the state that the defendant failed to preserve his claim.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-18\">\n   \"The standards for reviewing a trial court's ruling on a motion pertaining to joinder are discussed at length in our [Supreme Court's] decisions in\n   <em>\n    State\n   </em>\n   v.\n   <em>\n    LaFleur\n   </em>\n   ,\n   <extracted-citation index=\"2\" url=\"https://cite.case.law/citations/?q=307%20Conn.%20115\">\n    307 Conn. 115\n   </extracted-citation>\n   , 159,\n   <extracted-citation index=\"3\" url=\"https://cite.case.law/citations/?q=51%20A.3d%201048\">\n    51 A.3d 1048\n   </extracted-citation>\n   (2012), and\n   <em>\n    State\n   </em>\n   v.\n   <em>\n    Payne\n   </em>\n   ,\n   <extracted-citation case-ids=\"12174344\" index=\"4\" url=\"https://cite.case.law/conn/303/538/#p544\">\n    303 Conn. 538\n   </extracted-citation>\n   , 544-50,\n   <extracted-citation index=\"5\" url=\"https://cite.case.law/citations/?q=34%20A.3d%20370\">\n    34 A.3d 370\n   </extracted-citation>\n   (2012).

As previously stated, the state originally charged the defendant in three separate informations with murder, criminal possession, and tampering. The state moved to consolidate those informations and the defendant orally objected in a hearing held on the same day. The basis for the defendant's objection was that it would be confusing and misleading to the jury to combine the criminal possession case with the murder case because, he argued, there was an inadequate nexus between the revolver found in the apartment on Owen Street, the defendant, and the murder. Additionally, he contended that the firearm was recovered in a closet and not on his person, which he claimed to be of consequence because he did not live at the Owen Street address. He also argued that no evidence connected the revolver to the one used in the murder and that the time span between the events was too attenuated.\n   <footnotemark>\n    5\n   </footnotemark>\n   The state argued that even if the revolver was not the one used in the murder, it would be admissible as uncharged misconduct to show that the defendant had the means to commit the crime.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-22\">\n   In ruling on the motion to consolidate, the court stated as follows: \"Now as far as the tampering is concerned\n   and the later in the day possession of the means ... the\n   <em>\n    Boscarino\n   </em>\n   factors, the[y] do involve discrete easily distinguishable factual scenario[s]. The matters ... being consolidated are not of violent nature, brutal or shocking; it's a possession and tampering. It would involve only a couple or three witnesses. It doesn't affect the duration particularly. And if what the state claims is true, and I would require them to put the evidence on in front of the court before it goes in front of the jury, it would be cross admissible under possession of the means as far as the possession of the pistol is concerned and consciousness of guilt as far as the tampering is concerned. Now I will\n   allow the consolidation, the defense may have an exception. But I wish any of the evidence of the events at Owen Street to have more than just an oral offer of proof from the state's attorney; I would like to at least hear from the witnesses before they testify in front of the jury to make sure that the ruling can stand. Now-so that's granted.\"\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-23\">\n   It is clear from the record that the defendant did not raise at trial his claim now on appeal that the evidence supporting the murder charges was inadmissible in the criminal possession case. \"[T]o review [a] claim, which has been articulated for the first time on appeal and not before the trial court, would result in a trial by ambuscade of the trial judge.\" (Internal quotation marks omitted.)\n   <em>\n    State\n   </em>\n   v.\n   <em>\n    Randolph\n   </em>\n   ,\n   <extracted-citation case-ids=\"3956053\" index=\"25\" url=\"https://cite.case.law/conn/284/328/#p374\">\n    284 Conn. 328\n   </extracted-citation>\n   , 374,\n   <extracted-citation index=\"26\" url=\"https://cite.case.law/citations/?q=933%20A.2d%201158\">\n    933 A.2d 1158\n   </extracted-citation>\n   (2007), quoting\n   <em>\n    West Farms Mall, LLC\n   </em>\n   v.\n   <em>\n    West Hartford\n   </em>\n   ,\n   <extracted-citation case-ids=\"3668826\" index=\"27\" url=\"https://cite.case.law/conn/279/1/#p28\">\n    279 Conn. 1\n   </extracted-citation>\n   , 28,\n   <extracted-citation index=\"28\" url=\"https://cite.case.law/citations/?q=901%20A.2d%20649\">\n    901 A.2d 649\n   </extracted-citation>\n   (2006).

The ground for the defendant's objection to joinder before the trial court was limited to the admissibility of the evidence supporting the criminal possession charge in the murder case. On appeal, he raises a distinct claim that the evidence supporting the murder charge was unduly prejudicial and inadmissible in his criminal possession case. The defendant did not raise this claim before the trial court, and, thus, it was not properly preserved.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-24\">\n   Moreover, at no point did the defendant move for severance after the informations were joined.

In fact, the court conditioned its joinder determination on an offer of proof from witnesses before they testified in front of the jury to ensure that the matters were cross admissible. When the court subsequently determined, however, that offer of proof was unnecessary, the defendant did not renew his objection to joinder or move to sever. At that time, he had the opportunity to raise a claim that the evidence of the murder was unduly prejudicial to him in the prosecution of the criminal possession charge, but he failed to raise any objection.
