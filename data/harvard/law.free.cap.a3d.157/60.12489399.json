The proposed intervenor, Maria G., appeals from the judgment of the trial court,\n   <em>\n    Hon. Barbara M. Quinn\n   </em>\n   , judge trial referee,\n   <footnotemark>\n    1\n   </footnotemark>\n   denying her motion to intervene as of right and permissively.\n   <footnotemark>\n    2\n   </footnotemark>\n   On appeal, Maria G. claims that her guardianship\n   interests over the minor child, Santiago G., will effectively be extinguished if the court terminates the parental rights of the respondent Melissa E.,\n   <footnotemark>\n    3\n   </footnotemark>\n   who is Santiago's biological mother. As such, she claims to have a right to intervene or, in the alternative, that she should be granted permissive intervention. We disagree, and conclude that Maria G. does not have a colorable claim of intervention as of right and, as such, is not appealing from a final judgment. Accordingly, we dismiss this appeal for lack of subject matter jurisdiction.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-11\">\n   The record and our decision in a related matter reveal the following relevant facts and procedural history.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-12\">\n   \"Santiago was born in Guatemala ... on April 18, 2009.

On June 15, 2016, the trial court denied Maria G.'s motion to intervene. This appeal followed. See footnote 2 of this opinion\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-16\">\n   Separate from the proceeding underlying the present appeal, Maria G. filed a petition for a writ of habeas corpus seeking custody of Santiago. In the course of these habeas proceedings, Maria G. produced a June, 2015 Guatemalan court order that recognizes her right to custody of Santiago. The habeas court,\n   <em>\n    Colin, J.\n   </em>\n   , determined that the June, 2015 order was sufficient to\n   establish prima facie evidence of Maria G.'s standing to pursue the habeas petition. On January 26, 2017, the habeas court,\n   <em>\n    Hon. Barbara M. Quinn\n   </em>\n   , issued a memorandum of decision resolving the parties' cross motions for summary judgment in the habeas action, in which it concluded that Maria G. could not establish that she is the parent or legal guardian of Santiago. Accordingly, the habeas court granted the commissioner's motion for summary judgment and denied the habeas petition.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-17\">\n   In the present appeal, Maria G. claims that the trial court improperly denied her motion to intervene in the termination of parental rights proceeding both as of right and permissively. Specifically, Maria G. asserts that she may intervene as a matter of right pursuant to the four factor test set forth in\n   <em>\n    BNY Western Trust\n   </em>\n   v.\n   <em>\n    Roman\n   </em>\n   ,\n   <extracted-citation case-ids=\"4304817\" index=\"10\" url=\"https://cite.case.law/conn/295/194/#p205\">\n    295 Conn. 194\n   </extracted-citation>\n   , 205,\n   <extracted-citation index=\"11\" url=\"https://cite.case.law/citations/?q=990%20A.2d%20853\">\n    990 A.2d 853\n   </extracted-citation>\n   (2010), because: (1) she has a direct and substantial interest in the termination of parental rights proceeding on the basis of the habeas court's decision in February, 2016, which recognized her prima facie interest in custody of Santiago; (2) her rights are not adequately represented by any party to the termination of parental rights proceeding; and (3) her interest could be impaired by the disposition because the termination of Melissa E.'s rights would effectively terminate Maria G.'s rights without due process, as the department could then move forward with the adoption proceedings for Santiago.\n   <footnotemark>\n    5\n   </footnotemark>\n   Maria G. further claims that the trial court abused its discretion in denying her motion for permissive intervention because the five factors governing such motions weigh in her favor.\n   <footnotemark>\n    6\n   </footnotemark>\n   See, e.g.,\n   <em>\n    Kerrigan\n   </em>\n   v.\n   <em>\n    Commissioner of Public Health\n   </em>\n   ,\n   <extracted-citation case-ids=\"3668734\" index=\"12\" url=\"https://cite.case.law/conn/279/447/#p461\">\n    279 Conn. 447\n   </extracted-citation>\n   , 461,\n   <extracted-citation index=\"13\" url=\"https://cite.case.law/citations/?q=904%20A.2d%20137\">\n    904 A.2d 137\n   </extracted-citation>\n   (2006).

The commissioner also claims that this court does not have subject matter jurisdiction to decide this appeal, on its merits, because Maria G. has not appealed from a final judgment. Specifically, the commissioner contends that this interlocutory appeal must be dismissed because Maria G. does not have a colorable claim of right to intervene because she has no direct and substantial interest in the termination proceeding, which only concerns Melissa E.'s parental rights. Finally, the commissioner claims that the court did not abuse its discretion in denying Maria G.'s motion to intervene permissively, because her actions in evading established adoption laws undermine her claim that this court should permissively grant her motion.\n   <footnotemark>\n    8\n   </footnotemark>\n   We\n   agree with the commissioner, and conclude that Maria G.'s appeal must be dismissed for lack of a final judgment.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-19\">\n   We first address the department's jurisdictional claim. \"Unless a specific right to appeal otherwise has been provided by statute, we must always determine the threshold question of whether the appeal is taken from a final judgment before considering the merits of the claim.\" (Internal quotation marks omitted.)\n   <em>\n    Palmer\n   </em>\n   v.\n   <em>\n    Friendly Ice Cream Corp.\n   </em>\n   ,\n   <extracted-citation case-ids=\"3958547\" index=\"14\" url=\"https://cite.case.law/conn/285/462/#p466\">\n    285 Conn. 462\n   </extracted-citation>\n   , 466-67,\n   <extracted-citation index=\"15\" url=\"https://cite.case.law/citations/?q=940%20A.2d%20742\">\n    940 A.2d 742\n   </extracted-citation>\n   (2008). \"We begin by setting forth the standard of review.

Although Maria G. filed her amended motion to intervene to \"allow her to argue and explain to the court the reason that she is the holder of legal rights as the parent of Santiago,\" intervening in the termination of parental rights action against Melissa E. is not the proper forum for her to advance these interests. Additionally, the termination of Melissa E.'s parental rights will not cause Maria G. irreparable harm or abrogate a right that she currently holds because, even assuming that Maria G. does have some guardianship interest over Santiago, the present termination proceeding would in no way affect that interest.

Because of our jurisdictional conclusion, we need not consider these additional arguments.\n   </p>\n  </footnote>\n  <footnote label=\"9\">\n   <p id=\"p-46\">\n    We note the lack of consistency in our state's appellate case law as to the analysis of interlocutory appeals from denials of motions to intervene.

Put another way, sometimes this court has addressed the question of whether a colorable claim exists separately from the four factor intervention as of right test, and other times it has not. Accordingly, we take this opportunity to clarify the proper approach.\n   </p>\n  </footnote>\n  <footnote label=\"10\">\n   <p id=\"p-47\">\n    To this end, this court expressed concerns at oral argument about whether the department would proceed immediately with adoption proceedings upon termination of Melissa E.'s parental rights, because to do so would effectively extinguish any potential rights of Maria G. At oral argument, Assistant Attorney General Benjamin Zivyon, counsel for the commissioner, assured this court that the department would not proceed with the adoption of Santiago until after the final disposition of Maria G.'s habeas proceeding. Zivyon represented to this court that Judge Quinn had not yet scheduled a trial for the termination of parental rights of Melissa E., and would not do so until after Maria G.'s habeas action was resolved, a proceeding over which Judge Quinn also presided. Moreover, we note that prior to any adoption proceeding, an affidavit must be filed stating that there is no proceeding pending in any other court affecting the custody of the child free for adoption. See General Statutes \u00a7 52-231a.\n   </p>\n   <p id=\"p-48\">\n    Additionally, we note that Maria G. had an opportunity to litigate the merits of her claims to guardianship in the proper venue, namely, the habeas court. After the filing of cross motions for summary judgment, the habeas court ultimately dismissed Maria G.'s habeas petition.\n   </p>\n  </footnote>\n  <footnote label=\"11\">\n   <p id=\"p-49\">\n    In Guatemala, Melissa E. filed a voluntary petition for confirmation with the Family Trial Court, San Benito, Peten, on June 17, 2015. In this petition, she granted custody to Maria G., \"since [Maria G.] is the woman who has cared for the minor child since his birth, as if he were her son, and has provided his sustenance and education.\" On June 18, 2015, the Judge of the Family Trial Court, Department of Peten, Guatemala, entered judgment, granting Maria G. parental rights, custody, and representation of Santiago. We note several important facts regarding this foreign judgment. First, this judgment was not sought until 2015, several years after the department removed Santiago from the custody of Maria G. Second, the Guatemalan judgment was rendered without notice to the department, Santiago's counsel, or the guardian ad litem for him, which is required by law. Third, and finally, when rendering its judgment, the Guatemalan court relied on Santiago's birth certificate, an admittedly illegally forged document, for which Maria G. pleaded guilty to a federal felony and soon will be deported.\n   </p>\n  </footnote>\n  <footnote label=\"12\">\n   <p id=\"p-50\">\n    This is further evidenced by the habeas court's complete adjudication of Maria G.'s interests, despite the fact that the termination of parental rights action against Melissa E. remains pending.\n   </p>\n  </footnote>\n </opinion>\n</casebody>\n"
