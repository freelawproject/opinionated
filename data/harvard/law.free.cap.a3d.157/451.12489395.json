From February 9, 1987, to June 6, 2012, plaintiff was employed as a police officer in the Port Authority's Public Safety Department. He attained the rank of police inspector. As an inspector, he held the position of Subject Matter Expert and participated in the development and administration of the evaluation and exam process for police officers seeking promotion to the rank of sergeant. In June 2011, he acknowledged receipt of and signed a document entitled \"Subject Matter Expert, Test Security Instructions,\" which required him to immediately notify the Assessment Specialist and the Supervisor of Assessment Services if he became aware of or suspected any type of improper conduct or other improprieties associated with the evaluation process or any of its components.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-12\">\n   Plaintiff became aware of improper conduct and/or other improprieties associated with the exam process for the sergeant position, which compromised the integrity of the exam. He failed to notify anyone of this improper conduct, and provided no competent evidence to the contrary. Following an investigation by the Office of Inspector General, the Port Authority's Human Resources Department recommended that plaintiff be permitted to retire prior to the filing of disciplinary charges for failing to report the improprieties.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-13\">\n   On June 6, 2012, plaintiff tendered his resignation and retired from the Port Authority. In August 2012, he served a notice of claim on the Port Authority, alleging violations of the New York Whistleblower Law (NYWL),\n   <em>\n    <extracted-citation index=\"2\" url=\"https://cite.case.law/citations/?q=N.Y.%20Lab.%20Law%20%C2%A7%20740\">\n     N.Y.

Plaintiff sought injunctive relief in the form of reinstatement and damages. Following the completion of discovery, defendants filed a motion for summary judgment. Defendants argued that the Port Authority is not subject to CEPA because it is a bi-state agency created pursuant to an interstate compact and did not expressly or impliedly consent to suit pursuant to this single-state legislation, and the NYWL is not complementary or parallel to CEPA.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-15\">\n   In response to defendants' summary judgment motion, plaintiff withdrew his claim for reinstatement. On appeal, plaintiff improperly attempts to resurrect this issue in a footnote in his merits brief.\n   <em>\n    See\n   </em>\n   <em>\n    Almog v.

The judge also found that CEPA and the NYWL were not substantially similar so as to impliedly alter the compact. The judge granted summary judgment and dismissed the complaint with prejudice. In granting summary judgment to the individual defendants, the judge found that they did not take any independent action\n   against plaintiff.

Plaintiff argues that because of these broad consent-to-suit statutes, the parallel and complementary implied consent analysis is inapplicable.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-18\">\n   We decline to address plaintiff's additional argument that the Port Authority is routinely subjected to suits based on single-state laws.
