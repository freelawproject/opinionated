Duncan, a citizen of Jamaica,\n   <footnotemark>\n    1\n   </footnotemark>\n   appeals following the denial of\n   his petition for certification to appeal from the judgment of the habeas court denying his petition for a writ of habeas corpus. On appeal, the petitioner claims that the habeas court (1) abused its discretion in denying certification to appeal, (2) improperly concluded that he had received the effective assistance of counsel and (3) improperly denied his due process claim that his pleas were not made knowingly and voluntarily. Because the petitioner did not demonstrate that the habeas court abused its discretion in denying the petition for certification to appeal, we dismiss the appeal.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-10\">\n   The following facts and procedural history are relevant to this appeal. The petitioner was charged in two separate informations as a result of events that had occurred at different times in different locations. On April 20, 2011, the petitioner appeared before the court,\n   <em>\n    Vitale, J\n   </em>\n   .,\n   and pleaded guilty, pursuant to the\n   <em>\n    Alford\n   </em>\n   doctrine,\n   <footnotemark>\n    2\n   </footnotemark>\n   to one count of larceny in the third degree (Hartford case). At this time, the prosecutor recited the facts underlying this plea: \"Your Honor, this matter goes back to November of 2009. At that time, [the petitioner] was apparently estranged from his wife .... A check came into the residence that they were sharing at that time made out to [the petitioner's wife] in the amount of $6000. The [petitioner] endorsed that check, deposited it to his own account, and took out $6000 of the funds for his own use, thus depriving his estranged wife of the money.\"\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-11\">\n   The prosecutor then stated that if the petitioner paid $6000 to his estranged wife, then the state would agree\n   to vacate the plea and nolle the larceny charge. During the canvass, the court informed the petitioner that the case would be continued for sentencing until July 29, 2011. Further, it instructed that if the petitioner appeared on that day with a certified bank check in the amount of $6000, the guilty plea would be vacated and the state would nolle the larceny charge. The court warned the petitioner that if he did not have the $6000, he would be sentenced to up to fifteen months incarceration.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-12\">\n   The court then asked the following question to the petitioner: \"Do you understand, sir, if you are not a United States citizen this could result in your being deported, excluded from the United States or denied naturalization; do you understand that?\" The petitioner replied: \"Yes, Your Honor.\" The court also expressly warned the petitioner that it would not grant any additional continuances past July 29, 2011. The court then found that the petitioner's plea was knowingly and voluntarily made with the assistance of counsel, Attorney Deron Freeman.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-13\">\n   On July 29, 2011, the petitioner appeared for sentencing with $3000.\n   <footnotemark>\n    3\n   </footnotemark>\n   The state requested a period of nine months incarceration. Freeman argued that the petitioner had used the $6000 to maintain the household while his estranged wife was incarcerated. Freeman further requested a suspended sentence. After reviewing the case file, the court sentenced the petitioner to fifteen months incarceration, execution suspended after sixty days, and three years of probation. The court also ordered full restitution within the first two years of probation.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-14\">\n   On September 15, 2011, the petitioner appeared before the court,\n   <em>\n    Sheridan, J.\n   </em>\n   , to plead guilty to assault in the third degree in violation of General Statutes \u00a7 53a-61 and reckless endangerment in the first degree in violation of General Statutes \u00a7 53a-63 (New Britain case). The prosecutor recited the following factual basis for the pleas: The petitioner was involved in a physical altercation with his girlfriend. At this time, the petitioner struck the victim, causing her pain and injuries, while she was holding her one year old son.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-15\">\n   During the plea canvass, the court stated: \"All right, and if you're not a U.S. citizen, with this conviction you may face consequences of deportation, exclusion for readmission or denial of naturalization pursuant to federal law.\" The petitioner indicated that he understood these consequences of his guilty plea. The court then found that the plea was voluntarily and knowingly made with the assistance of competent counsel. The court ordered consecutive sentences of one year of incarceration, execution suspended, with two years of probation, for the assault in the third degree and reckless endangerment charges. The defendant was represented by Attorney Kelly Goulet-Case, an assistant public defender.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-16\">\n   On October 11, 2011, Judge Sheridan held a hearing on the petitioner's motion for modification in the New Britain case. During that proceeding, the prosecutor noted that she had no objection to the plea on the reckless endangerment charge being vacated. She further agreed to nolle that charge, leaving only the conviction of assault in the third degree in the New Britain case. The court granted the petitioner's motion for modification.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-17\">\n   On October 5, 2011, the United States Department of Homeland Security commenced removal proceedings against the petitioner on the ground that his conviction\n   of larceny in the third degree constituted an aggravated felony pursuant to\n   <extracted-citation index=\"0\" url=\"https://cite.case.law/citations/?q=8%20U.S.C.%20%C2%A7%201227\">\n    8 U.S.C. \u00a7 1227\n   </extracted-citation>\n   (a)(2)(A)(iii). On February 29, 2012, an immigration judge ordered the petitioner removed to Jamaica. The United States Board of Immigration Appeals dismissed the appeal from the order of the immigration judge. Thereafter, the petitioner was deported from the United States to Jamaica in February, 2013.\n   <footnotemark>\n    4\n   </footnotemark>\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-18\">\n   In November, 2011, the petitioner commenced the present action. The operative petition was filed on April 22, 2014. In count one, the petitioner alleged that his\n   right to due process was violated because his pleas in the Hartford and New Britain cases were not knowingly, intelligently and voluntarily made. The petitioner further claimed that he did not know or understand the probability of deportation and/or removal under the terms of his plea agreements.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-19\">\n   In counts two and three, the petitioner claimed that Freeman and Goulet-Case provided ineffective assistance of counsel in the Hartford and New Britain cases, respectively. Specifically, he alleged that both of his attorneys failed (1) to research adequately the legal issue of the petitioner's immigration status and the possibility of deportation and/or removal as a result of the plea agreements, (2) to advise the petitioner that larceny is an aggravated felony for immigration purposes, subjecting him to automatic removal and ineligibility for cancelation of removal and (3) to make the petitioner's immigration status part of the plea bargaining process. The petitioner also alleged that but for the deficient performance of his attorneys, he would not have pleaded guilty and instead insisted on going to trial.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-20\">\n   The court,\n   <em>\n    Fuger, J.\n   </em>\n   , held the habeas trial on September 3, 2014, during which Freeman, Goulet-Case, Attorney Anthony Collins, an expert in immigration law,\n   <footnotemark>\n    5\n   </footnotemark>\n   and the petitioner testified.\n   <footnotemark>\n    6\n   </footnotemark>\n   On September 18, 2014, the court issued a memorandum of decision denying the petition for a writ of habeas corpus. With respect to the ineffective assistance of counsel claim against Freeman in the Hartford case, the habeas court concluded\n   that the petitioner had failed to establish deficient performance and prejudice. With respect to the New Britain case, the habeas court determined that Goulet-Case performed deficiently by assuming that the petitioner was a United States citizen. The habeas court then noted that the New Britain case \"played no part in the immigration issue, and there was no showing of any other prejudice incurring to the petitioner ....\" Although the court did not explicitly address the petitioner's due process claim, it denied the petition for a writ of habeas corpus and the subsequent petition for certification to appeal.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-21\">\n   Following the filing of this appeal, the petitioner filed a motion for articulation, requesting that the court address his due process claim. After the habeas court denied this motion, the petitioner filed a motion for review with this court. We granted that motion and the relief requested, ordering the habeas court to articulate whether it had denied count one of the habeas petition and, if so, on what basis. On October 22, 2015, the habeas court issued its articulation. The court explained that the petitioner's due process claim was \"wholly dependent on the claims alleged in the other two counts .... Stated somewhat differently, the petitioner cannot prevail on the claim in count one, as it is factually and legally pleaded, without also proving the claims in counts two and three.\" The court further clarified that the petitioner's due process claim implicitly had been denied on the same grounds as the ineffective assistance of counsel claims in counts two and three of the operative habeas petition. Additional facts will be set forth as necessary.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-22\">\n   The petitioner claims that the habeas court abused its discretion in denying his\n   petition for certification to appeal\n   <footnotemark>\n    7\n   </footnotemark>\n   from the denial of his petition for a writ of\n   habeas corpus with respect to his claims of ineffective assistance of counsel and due process violations. Specifically, he argues that because these issues are debatable among jurists of reason, a court could resolve the issues differently or the issues should proceed further, the habeas court abused its discretion in denying his petition to appeal.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-23\">\n   \"Faced with a habeas court's denial of a petition for certification to appeal, a petitioner can obtain appellate review of the dismissal of his petition for habeas corpus only by satisfying the two-pronged test enunciated by our Supreme Court in\n   <em>\n    Simms\n   </em>\n   v.\n   <em>\n    Warden\n   </em>\n   ,\n   <extracted-citation case-ids=\"760025\" index=\"1\" url=\"https://cite.case.law/conn/229/178/\">\n    229 Conn. 178\n   </extracted-citation>\n   ,\n   <extracted-citation index=\"2\" url=\"https://cite.case.law/citations/?q=640%20A.2d%20601\">\n    640 A.2d 601\n   </extracted-citation>\n   (1994), and adopted in\n   <em>\n    Simms\n   </em>\n   v.\n   <em>\n    Warden\n   </em>\n   ,\n   <extracted-citation case-ids=\"763418\" index=\"3\" url=\"https://cite.case.law/conn/230/608/#p612\">\n    230 Conn. 608\n   </extracted-citation>\n   , 612,\n   <extracted-citation index=\"4\" url=\"https://cite.case.law/citations/?q=646%20A.2d%20126\">\n    646 A.2d 126\n   </extracted-citation>\n   (1994).

Second, if the petitioner can show an\n   abuse of discretion, he must then prove that the decision of the habeas court should be reversed on the merits.... To prove that the denial of his petition for certification to appeal constituted an abuse of discretion, the petitioner must demonstrate that the [resolution of the underlying claim involves issues that] are debatable among jurists of reason; that a court could resolve the issues [in a different manner]; or that the questions are adequate to deserve encouragement to proceed further.... In determining whether the habeas court abused its discretion in denying the petitioner's request for certification, we necessarily must consider the merits of the petitioner's underlying claims to determine whether the habeas court reasonably determined that the petitioner's appeal was frivolous.

With these principles in mind, we turn to the substantive claims of the petitioner.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-24\">\n   I\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-25\">\n   The petitioner claims that the habeas court improperly concluded that he received the effective assistance of counsel. Specifically, he argues that the court improperly determined that (1) Freeman did not provide deficient performance and (2) the petitioner was not prejudiced in both the Hartford case and by Goulet-Case in the New Britain case. We agree with the petitioner's first argument. With respect to the issue of prejudice\n   in both the Hartford and New Britain cases, we conclude that the petitioner's appellate argument is unavailing and, therefore, his claims of ineffective assistance of counsel must fail. As a result, we conclude that the habeas court did not abuse its discretion in denying certification to appeal from the denial of the petition for a writ of habeas corpus.

Specifically, he contends that Freeman did not meet this standard because he failed to inform him of the likely immigration consequences as a result of his guilty plea in the Hartford case. We agree.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-35\">\n   The following additional facts are necessary for our discussion. At the habeas trial, Freeman testified that he could not recall advising the petitioner that if he pleaded guilty to larceny in the third degree with a sentence of greater than twelve months and that charge was not subsequently nolled, the petitioner would be deportable without a defense. Freeman admitted that he probably was unaware that larceny in the third degree and a sentence greater than twelve months constituted an aggravated felony for federal immigration purposes. He also acknowledged that he likely was unaware of the fact that a conviction of an aggravated felony would result in a lawful permanent resident being deportable without a defense. Freeman, without a specific recollection of the events pertaining to this case, stated that his general practice was to advise clients facing possible immigration consequences to consult with an immigration attorney.\n   <footnotemark>\n    8\n   </footnotemark>\n   Freeman claimed that\n   he knew of the United States Supreme Court's decision in\n   <em>\n    Padilla\n   </em>\n   v.\n   <em>\n    Kentucky\n   </em>\n   ,\n   <extracted-citation case-ids=\"3581896,12447673\" index=\"73\" url=\"https://cite.case.law/us/559/356/\">\n    559 U.S. 356\n   </extracted-citation>\n   ,\n   <extracted-citation case-ids=\"3581896,12447673\" index=\"74\" url=\"https://cite.case.law/us/559/356/\">\n    130 S.Ct. 1473\n   </extracted-citation>\n   ,\n   <extracted-citation case-ids=\"3581896,12447673\" index=\"75\" url=\"https://cite.case.law/us/559/356/\">\n    176 L.Ed.2d 284\n   </extracted-citation>\n   (2010), at the time of the plea canvass in the Hartford case, but could not recall if he had conducted any legal research with respect to the immigration issue.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-36\">\n   The petitioner testified that Freeman could not provide a \"firm yes or no answer\" regarding the petitioner's immigration status. The petitioner also stated that Freeman tried to assure him that \"as far as he could see, it shouldn't be a problem.\"\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-37\">\n   In its memorandum of decision, the habeas court stated: \"[I]t was clear that conviction of larceny in the third degree and a sentence in excess of one year would result in a near mandatory deportation for the petitioner. It is clear to this court that ... Freeman was aware of such a draconic result and [took] appropriate steps to ensure that would not happen. This court is also satisfied that under the totality of the evidence and the logical inferences to be drawn therefrom that ... Freeman did discuss the immigration implications with the petitioner. Moreover, it is also clear that the petitioner was advised and did have access to, as well as the ability to seek, more expert advice had he so desired.\"\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-38\">\n   In addressing the claim that Freeman was constitutionally deficient because he failed to advise the petitioner that deportation would be mandatory and nonappealable, the habeas court cited the\n   <em>\n    Padilla\n   </em>\n   decision, noting that counsel must inform the client when a plea presents a risk of deportation. The habeas court emphasized: \"[T]he [United States] Supreme Court did not lay down a bright line that clearly defines the [parameters] of this duty, leaving that issue instead to the state courts. Here, in Connecticut, our appellate courts ha[ve] previously indicated that [a] defendant need only be made aware of the direct consequences\n   of his plea for it to be valid. ... Our Supreme Court has explained that [a]lthough a defendant must be aware of the direct consequences of a plea, the scope of direct consequences is very narrow.... The failure to inform a defendant as to all possible indirect and collateral consequences does not render a plea unintelligent or involuntary in a constitutional sense.... [U]nder Connecticut law, [t]he impact of a plea's immigration consequences on a defendant, while potentially great, is not of constitutional magnitude and cannot transform this collateral consequence into a direct consequence of the plea.\" (Emphasis\n   omitted; internal quotation marks omitted.) It concluded that Freeman had satisfied the minimal standard in advising the petitioner of the immigration consequences of his guilty plea in the Hartford case, and therefore did not render deficient performance.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-39\">\n   In order to assess this conclusion of the habeas court, a review of\n   <em>\n    Padilla\n   </em>\n   v.\n   <em>\n    Kentucky\n   </em>\n   , supra,\n   <extracted-citation case-ids=\"3581896,12447673\" index=\"76\" url=\"https://cite.case.law/us/559/356/\">\n    559 U.S. at 356\n   </extracted-citation>\n   ,\n   <extracted-citation case-ids=\"3581896,12447673\" index=\"77\" url=\"https://cite.case.law/us/559/356/\">\n    130 S.Ct. 1473\n   </extracted-citation>\n   , and\n   <em>\n    Budziszewski\n   </em>\n   v.\n   <em>\n    Commissioner of Correction\n   </em>\n   ,\n   <extracted-citation case-ids=\"12486196\" index=\"78\" url=\"https://cite.case.law/a3d/142/243/\">\n    322 Conn. 504\n   </extracted-citation>\n   ,\n   <extracted-citation case-ids=\"12486196\" index=\"79\" url=\"https://cite.case.law/a3d/142/243/\">\n    142 A.3d 243\n   </extracted-citation>\n   (2016), is necessary.

Freeman also admitted that he \"[p]robably\" was unaware that a conviction of larceny in the third degree with a sentence greater than one year constituted an aggravated felony for immigration purposes and that he was unaware that an aggravated felony rendered a noncitizen deportable without a defense. Freeman further testified that he generally did not conduct legal research on immigration issues for noncitizen criminal defendants.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-49\">\n   In its memorandum of decision, the habeas court noted Freeman's testimony regarding his usual practice to \"discover the ramifications of a conviction upon a\n   person's immigration status and make sure that a defendant was aware that there could be consequences if the case resulted in a conviction.\" It further recited the testimony that Freeman understood immigration law sufficiently \"to give somewhat summary advice to a defendant similarly situated to the petitioner\" and that he would advise his clients to seek the advice of an immigration attorney if the client believed it was necessary. The habeas court, however, did not specifically credit or make a finding regarding these portions of Freeman's testimony.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-50\">\n   The habeas court did find that a conviction of larceny in the third degree and a sentence of greater than one year would result in a \"near mandatory deportation for the petitioner.\"\n   <footnotemark>\n    10\n   </footnotemark>\n   It further found that Freeman, mindful of this \"draconian result\"\n   <footnotemark>\n    11\n   </footnotemark>\n   discussed the immigration implications with the petitioner. In response to the petitioner's argument that Freeman failed to tell him that removal was mandatory and nonappealable, the habeas court indicated that these collateral consequences were not of constitutional magnitude and could not be transformed into direct consequences.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-51\">\n   In accordance with the clarification in\n   <em>\n    Budziszewski\n   </em>\n   of counsel's duty to unequivocally inform a client of the mandatory deportation as a consequence of pleading guilty to an aggravated felony, the habeas court improperly concluded that Freeman's performance was not deficient. Specifically, Freeman failed to comply with\n   <em>\n    Padilla\n   </em>\n   because he did not explain the clear immigration consequences set forth in federal law in an accurate manner and in terms that the petitioner could comprehend.\n   <em>\n    Budziszewski\n   </em>\n   v.\n   <em>\n    Commissioner of Correction\n   </em>\n   , supra, 322 Conn. at 515,\n   <extracted-citation case-ids=\"12486196\" index=\"135\" url=\"https://cite.case.law/a3d/142/243/\">\n    142 A.3d 243\n   </extracted-citation>\n   . The immigration consequences in this case were clearly discernable; a conviction of larceny in the third degree with a sentence greater than one year constituted an aggravated felony for immigration purposes and thus federal law mandated deportation. Freeman, therefore, was obligated to convey to the petitioner unequivocally this consequence of pleading guilty. See\n   <extracted-citation case-ids=\"12486196\" index=\"136\" url=\"https://cite.case.law/a3d/142/243/\">\n    id., at 512\n   </extracted-citation>\n   ,\n   <extracted-citation case-ids=\"12486196\" index=\"137\" url=\"https://cite.case.law/a3d/142/243/\">\n    142 A.3d 243\n   </extracted-citation>\n   .

Moreover, even if the habeas court expressly had credited Freeman's testimony that larceny in the third degree is a crime of moral turpitude and therefore could \"create some\n   problems with regard to ... immigration,\" this statement does not meet the required standard set forth in\n   <em>\n    Padilla.\n   </em>\n   We conclude, therefore, that this advice is akin to the advice given in\n   <em>\n    Budziszewski\n   </em>\n   where counsel warned of a \"heightened risk of deportation ....\" (Internal quotation marks omitted.)\n   <em>\n    Budziszewski\n   </em>\n   v.\n   <em>\n    Commissioner of Correction\n   </em>\n   , supra, 322 Conn. at 512,\n   <extracted-citation case-ids=\"12486196\" index=\"138\" url=\"https://cite.case.law/a3d/142/243/\">\n    142 A.3d 243\n   </extracted-citation>\n   .\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-52\">\n   Simply put, Freeman was required to inform the petitioner that, as a result of his guilty plea to a crime that fell within the federal definition of an aggravated felony, he was subject to mandatory deportation under federal law, which Freeman failed to do. His advice did not meet the standard set forth in\n   <em>\n    Padilla\n   </em>\n   as interpreted by\n   <em>\n    Budziszewski.\n   </em>\n   Accordingly, we agree with the petitioner that the habeas court improperly determined that Freeman was not deficient, under\n   <em>\n    Strickland\n   </em>\n   , with respect to his advice regarding the immigration consequences in the Hartford case.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-53\">\n   B\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-54\">\n   The petitioner next argues that the habeas court improperly concluded that he was not prejudiced as a result of the deficient performance of Freeman and Goulet-Case. Specifically, he contends that prejudice should be presumed in the present case because the proceedings were presumptively unreliable or entirely nonexistent; additionally, he claims that he suffered \"extreme prejudice\" by having an aggravated felony conviction on his record, by being incarcerated in both state and federal facilities, and by being deported and prevented from returning to the United States. Because prejudice is not presumed in this case, and the petitioner's appellate brief failed to directly challenge the habeas court's determination that the petitioner would not have pleaded guilty and would have insisted on going to trial, his claim of ineffective assistance of counsel must fail.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-55\">\n   The following additional facts are necessary for our discussion. At the habeas trial, the petitioner testified that he would not have pleaded guilty to a crime that was an aggravated felony if he had known of its immigration consequences. He later indicated that because he was not aware of any possible effect as to his immigration status, the petitioner's trepidation about entering a plea related to the loss of his employment and the conviction of a serious crime. During his direct examination, the petitioner was asked if he would have accepted that offer had he known that his guilty plea in the Hartford case would result in his deportation. He responded: \"I would not have submitted a guilty plea in this case. The guilty plea was proposed as a way of trying to, if you will, clear the matter in the-as quick a way as possible. Taking responsibility for what I was involved with ... [by] paying restitution.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-56\">\n   But as a far as-that was the farthest thing from my mind. I wouldn't want to lose seventeen years of teaching, two college degrees, my two sons, all of the community groups-church, friends, networks, family-just in order to remove a guilty plea? I would not expose myself to that consciously. No. Absolutely not.\" He further stated that he would have accepted another disposition in order to avoid deportation, including going to trial or accepting a sentence with additional jail time.\n   <footnotemark>\n    13\n   </footnotemark>\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-57\">\n   The habeas court determined that the petitioner failed to sustain his burden of establishing prejudice.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-58\">\n   It concluded that no rational individual would have rejected the plea agreement in the Hartford case. \"Had the petitioner brought in the agreed upon restitution that he assured [Freeman] he had the means to easily satisfy, there would have been no conviction, no criminal record, no immigration issues and the petitioner could have resumed his seemingly productive life. Indeed, rejection of the plea bargain under the circumstances of this case would have been irrational.\"\n   <footnotemark>\n    14\n   </footnotemark>\n   (Emphasis omitted.)\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-59\">\n   In addressing the New Britain case, the habeas court noted that Goulet-Case performed deficiently by assuming that the petitioner was a citizen of the United States. \"Nevertheless, given that the New Britain case played no part in the immigration issue and there was no showing of any other prejudice incurring to the petitioner, this court will deny habeas relief on that ground.\" The habeas court then cited to the\n   <em>\n    Hill\n   </em>\n   modification of the prejudice prong.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-60\">\n   On appeal, the petitioner, citing to\n   <em>\n    Roe\n   </em>\n   v.\n   <em>\n    Flores-Ortega\n   </em>\n   ,\n   <extracted-citation case-ids=\"9476451\" index=\"139\" url=\"https://cite.case.law/us/528/470/#p484\">\n    528 U.S. 470\n   </extracted-citation>\n   , 484,\n   <extracted-citation case-ids=\"9476451\" index=\"140\" url=\"https://cite.case.law/us/528/470/#p484\">\n    120 S.Ct. 1029\n   </extracted-citation>\n   ,\n   <extracted-citation case-ids=\"9476451\" index=\"141\" url=\"https://cite.case.law/us/528/470/#p484\">\n    145 L.Ed.2d 985\n   </extracted-citation>\n   (2000), notes that \"[p]rejudice may be presumed, however, when a violation of the right to counsel rendered the proceeding presumptively unreliable or entirely nonexistent.\" (Internal quotation marks omitted.)

Instead, it concluded that no\n   rational person would have rejected the plea deal in the Hartford case. It also determined that there was no showing of prejudice in the New Britain case. On appeal, however, the petitioner has not directly challenged the court's conclusion that he would not have accepted the plea deal and proceeded to a trial. Instead, the petitioner argues in his brief that he was prejudiced as a result of \"having an aggravated felony conviction on his record ... by having served twenty-two months in immigration detention in addition to the sixty days he served as part of his sentence ... [by having been removed] from this country and from his permanent inadmissibility as a result of his aggravated felony conviction ... [and by the] additional disruption this has caused in his otherwise productive life.\" Undoubtedly, these events have had a negative impact and caused disruption to the life of the petitioner. They do not, however, apply to the relevant legal inquiry, which is the test for prejudice as set forth in\n   <em>\n    Hill\n   </em>\n   v.\n   <em>\n    Lockhart\n   </em>\n   , supra,\n   <extracted-citation case-ids=\"6197970\" index=\"171\" url=\"https://cite.case.law/us/474/52/#p57\">\n    474 U.S. at 58-59\n   </extracted-citation>\n   ,\n   <extracted-citation case-ids=\"6197970\" index=\"172\" url=\"https://cite.case.law/us/474/52/#p57\">\n    106 S.Ct. 366\n   </extracted-citation>\n   .

Simply put, his appellate argument missed the mark and we are left, essentially, with an unchallenged conclusion of no prejudice from the habeas court. \"It is not enough merely to mention a possible argument in\n   the most skeletal way, leaving the court to do counsel's work, create the ossature for the argument, and put flesh on its bones.\" (Internal quotation marks omitted.)\n   <em>\n    State\n   </em>\n   v.\n   <em>\n    Fetscher\n   </em>\n   ,\n   <extracted-citation index=\"173\" url=\"https://cite.case.law/citations/?q=162%20Conn.%20App.%20145\">\n    162 Conn.App. 145\n   </extracted-citation>\n   , 155-56,\n   <extracted-citation index=\"174\" url=\"https://cite.case.law/citations/?q=130%20A.3d%20892\">\n    130 A.3d 892\n   </extracted-citation>\n   (2015), cert. denied,\n   <extracted-citation case-ids=\"12484928,12484929\" index=\"175\" url=\"https://cite.case.law/conn/321/904/\">\n    321 Conn. 904\n   </extracted-citation>\n   ,\n   <extracted-citation case-ids=\"12484928\" index=\"176\" url=\"https://cite.case.law/a3d/138/280/\">\n    138 A.3d 280\n   </extracted-citation>\n   (2016). The petitioner failed to establish that he was denied his constitutional right to the effective assistance of counsel and, therefore, the habeas court properly denied counts two and three of the habeas petition. We conclude, therefore, that the petitioner failed to demonstrate that his issues regarding Freeman and Goulet-Case are debatable among jurists of reasons, that a court could resolve the issues in a different manner or that they are adequate to proceed further. Thus, the habeas court did not abuse its discretion in denying certification to appeal as to the petitioner's claims of ineffective assistance of counsel. See\n   <em>\n    Sanders\n   </em>\n   v.\n   <em>\n    Commissioner of Correction\n   </em>\n   , supra, 169 Conn.App. at 838,\n   <extracted-citation case-ids=\"12489066\" index=\"177\" url=\"https://cite.case.law/a3d/153/8/#p821\">\n    153 A.3d 8\n   </extracted-citation>\n   .\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-65\">\n   II\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-66\">\n   The petitioner also claims that the habeas court improperly denied certification to appeal the habeas court's denial of his due process claim that his pleas were not made knowingly and voluntarily. Specifically, he argues that because counsel did not explain that mandatory deportation was the result of his guilty pleas, the pleas were not knowing and voluntary, and, thus in violation of his right to due process. We disagree with the petitioner and conclude that the habeas court did not abuse its discretion in denying certification to appeal as to this issue.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-67\">\n   The following additional facts are necessary for our discussion. In its articulation, the habeas court expressly addressed the petitioner's due process claim: \"Although the claim in count one is alleged as a freestanding separate claim, it nevertheless is, in this court's analysis and a fair reading of the factual allegations,\n   wholly dependent on the claims alleged in the other two counts. It is counsel, if anyone, who would have a duty to properly advise the petitioner that he would 'know or understand the probability of deportation/removal under the terms of the plea agreement.' Stated somewhat differently, the petitioner cannot prevail on the claim in count one, as it is factually and legally pleaded, without also proving the claims in counts two and three.\"\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-68\">\n   Our recent decision in\n   <em>\n    Flomo\n   </em>\n   v.\n   <em>\n    Commissioner of Correction\n   </em>\n   , supra, 169 Conn.App. at 266,\n   <extracted-citation case-ids=\"12487925\" index=\"178\" url=\"https://cite.case.law/a3d/149/185/#p278\">\n    149 A.3d 185\n   </extracted-citation>\n   , guides our resolution of this issue.

Our Supreme Court concluded that, just as with the canvass requirements set forth in Practice Book \u00a7 39-19 to ensure that a plea is voluntary, only substantial compliance with \u00a7 54-1j, not a verbatim reading of the statutory language, is required.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-72\">\n   <em>\n    State\n   </em>\n   v.\n   <em>\n    Malcolm\n   </em>\n   , supra, at 661-63,\n   <extracted-citation index=\"186\" url=\"https://cite.case.law/citations/?q=778%20A.2d%20134\">\n    778 A.2d 134\n   </extracted-citation>\n   .

The court stated: \"Here, the basis of the petitioner's removal in this case was his state court convictions. If the petitioner is successful in prosecuting this habeas petition, the result would be an order of this court vacating his conviction. Based on federal precedents ... it appears that if the petitioner's convictions are vacated, he could seek relief from the federal authorities to cancel or reopen his immigration proceedings in order to seek reentry into this country.
