J.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-9\">\n   The primary issue that we must decide in this appeal is whether the trial court properly denied the defendant's motion for a judgment of acquittal and for a new trial after the jury rendered legally inconsistent guilty verdicts on charges of murder and of manslaughter in the first degree with a firearm. The state charged the defendant, Chihan Eric Chyung, with murder in violation of General Statutes \u00a7 53a-54a and manslaughter in the first degree with a firearm in violation of General Statutes \u00a7 53a-55a(a)\n   <footnotemark>\n    1\n   </footnotemark>\n   in connection with the shooting death of his wife, Paige Chyung (victim). After a trial, the jury rendered verdicts of guilty on both charges. Thereafter, the defendant filed a motion for judgment of acquittal and for a new trial contending that the verdicts were legally inconsistent because, to\n   convict the defendant of murder, the jury had to find that he had a specific intent to kill the victim, whereas, to convict him of manslaughter in the first degree, the jury was required to find that he acted recklessly. The trial court denied the motion on the ground that the defendant had waived the claim by failing to request a jury instruction that he could not be convicted of both charges. The trial court also concluded, however, that the verdict of guilty on the manslaughter charge must be vacated pursuant to case law holding that, when a defendant is convicted of both a greater offense and a lesser included offense, thereby violating constitutional double jeopardy principles, the proper remedy is to vacate the conviction on the lesser included offense. After vacating the guilty verdict of manslaughter in the first degree with a firearm, the trial court sentenced the defendant to forty years imprisonment on the murder charge. This appeal followed.\n   <footnotemark>\n    2\n   </footnotemark>\n   We conclude that the trial court improperly determined that the defendant had waived the claim that the guilty verdicts on the charges of murder and manslaughter in the first degree with a firearm were legally inconsistent by failing to request a jury instruction on the issue. Rather, we conclude that legally inconsistent verdicts involve jury error that may be raised for the first time after the verdicts have been returned or on appeal. Because we conclude that the verdicts were legally inconsistent, and because there is no way for the trial court or this court to know which charge the jury found to be supported by the evidence, neither verdict can stand. Accordingly, we conclude that both guilty verdicts must be vacated and the\n   case must be remanded to the trial court for a new trial.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-10\">\n   The jury reasonably could have found the following facts, which support either the guilty verdict on the\n   charge of manslaughter in the first degree with a firearm or the guilty verdict on the charge of murder. The defendant testified that he and the victim, who were married in May, 2009, lived at 257 Norwich Avenue in Norwich. According to the defendant, on the evening of June 2, 2009, they had an argument about the victim's purchase of new tires for her truck. The victim was upset because the defendant told her that she had paid too much for the tires. She left the residence, telling the defendant, \"I can't care if you're here when I get back.\" The defendant and the victim then had several telephone conversations, during which they continued to argue. The defendant ultimately decided that he should leave the residence and he packed a bag with his belongings. He then placed the bag by the kitchen door and waited for the victim to return.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-11\">\n   The defendant testified that the victim returned to the residence at about 7:30 p.m. The defendant and the victim continued to argue, and the defendant decided that he would leave and go to a friend's house in New Haven. He then retrieved his pistol from a nightstand in the second floor bedroom and brought it downstairs to the kitchen, intending to pack it in his bag. He put the bag on the kitchen table and, as he attempted to open the bag by pulling on the zippers, the gun discharged. The defendant testified that he had not known that the gun was loaded. After the gun fired, the defendant looked up and saw the victim, who looked scared. She then fell to the floor. Believing that the victim was dead, the defendant grabbed his bag, went to his truck and drove away from the residence.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-12\">\n   As he was driving, the defendant called a friend and told him that the victim had been shot. The friend told the defendant that he should return to the residence and call 911. The defendant then drove back to the residence, called 911 while still in his truck and reported that he had shot the victim.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-13\">\n   Thomas Lazzaro, a patrol officer with the Norwich Police Department (department), testified that he and other members of the department responded to the defendant's 911 call. Upon arriving at the defendant's residence, the police arrested him. They kicked in the door to the residence and found the victim's body on the kitchen floor. Lazzaro observed that the house was in disarray and that items were \"thrown all over the place ....\" In the living room, the victim's purse was on the floor and its contents were strewn \"all over the area.\" Pieces of a broken ice cube tray were found scattered around the first floor and, in the second floor bedroom, Lazzaro observed a broken ashtray.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-14\">\n   Damien Martin, a patrol officer with the department, testified that, after the defendant was given a\n   <em>\n    Miranda\n   </em>\n   warning\n   <footnotemark>\n    3\n   </footnotemark>\n   at the scene of the shooting, he was asked what had happened. The defendant stated that he and the victim had an argument about a fishing pole that he had purchased because the victim was upset about the expense. He also stated that he had been drinking. After deciding to leave the residence, he packed a suitcase and put it on the kitchen table. He then decided to pack his handgun. As he attempted to put the gun into the suitcase, it accidentally fired and struck the victim.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-15\">\n   Amber Levesque testified that she and her boyfriend, Richard Hernandez, lived in\n   an apartment in a building next door to the defendant's residence on the date of the shooting. At approximately 9:30 p.m., she heard a man and a woman arguing in the residence. After approximately twenty minutes, the argument stopped. Levesque then heard the woman scream and, approximately fifteen seconds later, a loud bang. Approximately two minutes after that, she heard a door slam. She then went to bed. Between approximately 11 and\n   11:30 p.m., Hernandez' mother, who lived in the same apartment, came into the bedroom and said that there were police in front of the defendant's residence. Hernandez testified that, starting at approximately 9:30 p.m., he heard arguing from the defendant's residence that lasted for approximately one-half hour. He then heard a woman scream, followed by a gunshot.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-16\">\n   Frank Evangelista, a physician employed by the Office of the Chief Medical Examiner, testified that he performed an autopsy on the victim. During the autopsy, Evangelista observed a gunshot wound to the victim's forehead and multiple areas of blunt trauma, including two bruises on her left chest, an abrasion on her back, and a bruise on each thigh. There was gunpowder stippling around the head wound, indicating that the gun had been one to three feet away from the victim's head when it was fired. An X-ray showed that the bullet had entered the victim's forehead and traveled to the back of her skull, causing her death.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-17\">\n   Gregory Danas testified for the defendant as an expert in the handling of firearms. Danas testified that the gun that the defendant had fired was a \"model Glock 19 ....\" He further testified that, on the basis of his discussions with the defendant about the events leading up to the shooting, \"any time [a] firearm is handled in that fashion, [there] is a high degree of probability, regardless of who's touching the gun, that that gun is going to go off,\" and that it was possible that the discharge was accidental.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-18\">\n   The defendant was charged in a two count substitute information with murder in violation of \u00a7 53a-54a and manslaughter in the first degree with a firearm in violation of \u00a7 53a-55a(a). During closing arguments, the state argued that the evidence established that the defendant was guilty of murder because he pointed the gun at the victim and pulled the trigger with the intent to cause\n   her death.\n   <footnotemark>\n    4\n   </footnotemark>\n   The defendant argued that, to the contrary, the evidence showed that the gun discharged because he had handled it carelessly and negligently.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-19\">\n   The jury returned verdicts of guilty on both the charge of murder and the charge of manslaughter in the first degree with a firearm. Thereafter, the defendant filed a motion for judgment of acquittal and for a new trial in which he contended, among other things, that the verdicts were legally inconsistent because the murder conviction required the jury to find that he had acted with the specific intent to cause the victim's death and the conviction on manslaughter in the first degree with a firearm required the jury to find that he had acted recklessly. The trial court denied the motion for a new trial on the ground that the defendant had failed to request a jury instruction that he could not be convicted on both charges. Cf.\n   <em>\n    State\n   </em>\n   v.\n   <em>\n    Kitchens\n   </em>\n   ,\n   <extracted-citation case-ids=\"4343690\" index=\"0\" url=\"https://cite.case.law/conn/299/447/#p466\">\n    299 Conn. 447\n   </extracted-citation>\n   , 466,\n   <extracted-citation index=\"1\" url=\"https://cite.case.law/citations/?q=10%20A.3d%20942\">\n    10 A.3d 942\n   </extracted-citation>\n   (2011) (defendant waives claim based on improper jury instruction when \"defense counsel acquiesces in the instructions following a meaningful opportunity to review them outside the rush of trial, participates in an\n   on-the-record charge conference designed to allow counsel to identify errors while they still can be remedied and takes no exception after the charge has been delivered\"). The court also concluded, however, that, under the circumstances of this case, the charge of manslaughter in the first degree with a firearm was a lesser included offense of the murder charge. Accordingly, the court concluded that, to protect the defendant's constitutional right not to be subject to multiple punishments for the same offense under the double jeopardy clause of the fifth amendment to the United States constitution, the defendant's manslaughter conviction must be vacated. See\n   <em>\n    State\n   </em>\n   v.\n   <em>\n    Polanco\n   </em>\n   ,\n   <extracted-citation index=\"2\" url=\"https://cite.case.law/citations/?q=308%20Conn.%20242\">\n    308 Conn. 242\n   </extracted-citation>\n   , 260,\n   <extracted-citation index=\"3\" url=\"https://cite.case.law/citations/?q=61%20A.3d%201084\">\n    61 A.3d 1084\n   </extracted-citation>\n   (2013) (\"when a defendant is convicted of greater and lesser included offenses, the trial court shall vacate the conviction for the lesser offense\"). Thereafter, the trial court rendered judgment in accordance with the guilty verdict on the murder charge.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-20\">\n   This appeal followed. The defendant contends that the trial court improperly denied his motion for a judgment of acquittal and for a new trial on the ground that he had failed to request a jury instruction that he could not be convicted of both the charge of murder and the charge of manslaughter in the first degree with a firearm. The defendant further contends that the guilty verdicts should be vacated because they were legally inconsistent. In addition, the defendant contends that the trial court improperly allowed the state to present certain evidence of uncharged misconduct. We agree with the defendant's position that the trial court improperly declined to review his claim that the verdicts were legally inconsistent and that the verdicts must be vacated. We reject, however, his evidentiary claim.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-21\">\n   I\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-22\">\n   We first address the defendant's claim that his convictions for manslaughter in the first degree with a firearm and murder must be vacated because: (1) they were legally inconsistent; and (2) contrary to the trial court's determination, he was not required to request a jury instruction that he could not be convicted of both offenses to preserve the issue for postverdict consideration. The following legal principles guide our analysis of this claim. \"A claim of legally inconsistent convictions, also referred to as mutually exclusive convictions, arises when a conviction of one offense requires a finding that negates an essential element of another offense of which the defendant also has been convicted.... In response to such a claim, we look carefully to determine\n   whether the existence of the essential elements for one offense negates the existence of [one or more] essential elements for another offense of which the defendant also stands convicted. If that is the case, the [convictions] are legally inconsistent and cannot withstand challenge.... Whether two convictions are mutually exclusive presents a question of law, over which our review is plenary.\" (Citations omitted; internal quotation marks omitted.)\n   <em>\n    State\n   </em>\n   v.\n   <em>\n    Nash\n   </em>\n   ,\n   <extracted-citation index=\"4\" url=\"https://cite.case.law/citations/?q=316%20Conn.%20651\">\n    316 Conn. 651\n   </extracted-citation>\n   , 659,\n   <extracted-citation index=\"5\" url=\"https://cite.case.law/citations/?q=114%20A.3d%20128\">\n    114 A.3d 128\n   </extracted-citation>\n   (2015).\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-23\">\n   This court previously has recognized that \"the statutory definitions of 'intentionally'\n   <footnotemark>\n    5\n   </footnotemark>\n   and 'recklessly'\n   <footnotemark>\n    6\n   </footnotemark>\n   are mutually\n   exclusive and inconsistent.

Rather, one acts recklessly when one \"is aware of and consciously disregards a substantial and unjustifiable risk that [a particular] result will occur ....\" General Statutes \u00a7 53a-3(13). Thus, a defendant cannot \"simultaneously [act] intentionally and recklessly with regard to the same act and the same result, i.e., the injury to the victim.\"\n   <em>\n    State\n   </em>\n   v.\n   <em>\n    King\n   </em>\n   , supra, at 593,\n   <extracted-citation index=\"10\" url=\"https://cite.case.law/citations/?q=583%20A.2d%20896\">\n    583 A.2d 896\n   </extracted-citation>\n   . Accordingly, jury verdicts convicting the defendant both on a charge requiring proof of specific\n   intent and on a charge requiring proof of recklessness, with respect to the same act and the same result, are legally inconsistent and cannot stand.

See General Statutes \u00a7 53a-54a. On the other hand, the jury's verdict of guilty on the count of manslaughter in the first degree required the jury to find that the defendant acted recklessly. See General Statutes \u00a7 53a-55a(a). Because a defendant cannot\n   simultaneously act intentionally and recklessly with respect to the same act and the same result, we conclude that the jury verdicts were legally inconsistent.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-26\">\n   We further conclude that the trial court improperly determined that the defendant's claim that the verdicts were legally inconsistent could not be raised for the first time in a motion for a new trial,\n   but should have been raised by way of a request for a jury instruction that the defendant could not be convicted of both offenses. The defendant contends that no such instruction was required because the inconsistent jury verdicts were the result of an unforeseeable misapplication by the jury of proper jury instructions.\n   <footnotemark>\n    8\n   </footnotemark>\n   The state contends that, to the contrary, the trial court's determination was correct under\n   <em>\n    State\n   </em>\n   v.\n   <em>\n    Kitchens\n   </em>\n   , supra,\n   <extracted-citation case-ids=\"4343690\" index=\"14\" url=\"https://cite.case.law/conn/299/447/#p466\">\n    299 Conn. at 466\n   </extracted-citation>\n   ,\n   <extracted-citation index=\"15\" url=\"https://cite.case.law/citations/?q=10%20A.3d%20942\">\n    10 A.3d 942\n   </extracted-citation>\n   . We conclude that the trial court should have instructed the jury that it could not find the defendant guilty of both offenses and the defendant's failure to request such an instruction did not bar him from subsequently challenging the legally inconsistent verdicts in a motion for a new trial.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-27\">\n   The proper procedure for raising a claim that guilty verdicts are legally inconsistent has never been squarely addressed by this court. Our research has revealed no Connecticut cases, however, that support the proposition that, when the state has charged the defendant with two offenses relating to the same act and the same result, and requiring mutually exclusive states of mind, the defendant is required to request a jury instruction that he cannot be found guilty of both offenses in order to preserve the issue of legally inconsistent verdicts for postverdict consideration by the trial court and review\n   on appeal.\n   <footnotemark>\n    9\n   </footnotemark>\n   For the following reasons, we now\n   conclude that the defendant is not required to do so.\n   This court previously has recognized that \"[m]utually exclusive [convictions] are the result of two positive findings of fact that cannot logically coexist.\" (Internal quotation marks omitted.)\n   <em>\n    State\n   </em>\n   v.\n   <em>\n    Arroyo\n   </em>\n   ,\n   <extracted-citation case-ids=\"4145506\" index=\"16\" url=\"https://cite.case.law/conn/292/558/\">\n    292 Conn. 558\n   </extracted-citation>\n   , 584 n.21,\n   <extracted-citation index=\"17\" url=\"https://cite.case.law/citations/?q=973%20A.2d%201254\">\n    973 A.2d 1254\n   </extracted-citation>\n   (2009). Thus, the state and the trial court must be presumed to know both on the basis of logic and on the basis of their legal training that, when the state has tried a case on the theory that the mutually exclusive offenses with which the defendant has been charged relate to the same act and the same result, the jury cannot properly render guilty verdicts on both charges. See\n   <em>\n    People\n   </em>\n   v.\n   <em>\n    Delgado\n   </em>\n   , Docket No. 13-CA-2024, ---P.3d ----, ----,\n   <extracted-citation index=\"18\" url=\"https://cite.case.law/citations/?q=2016%20WL%207009119\">\n    2016 WL 7009119\n   </extracted-citation>\n   , *3 (Colo. App. 2016) (because it is manifestly obvious that defendant may not be convicted on charges that are legally inconsistent, trial court's acceptance of legally inconsistent verdicts is plain error).\n   <footnotemark>\n    10\n   </footnotemark>\n   Accordingly, this situation is distinguishable from the ordinary situation in which a defendant raises an unpreserved claim of instructional\n   error. Ordinarily, such a claim involves a logical and consistent verdict that was based on an\n   <em>\n    improper\n   </em>\n   charge. When a jury returns legally inconsistent guilty verdicts, however, it has returned illogical and inconsistent verdicts that were based on a\n   <em>\n    proper\n   </em>\n   charge. Therefore, the claim is more properly characterized as involving jury error than instructional error.

Febles stated that, starting some time in 1995, she and the defendant lived together for one year.

Specifically, he contends that Febles' statement to the police was unreliable because it was given seventeen years after the incident and she had never reported the incident before that time. The defendant further contends that, even if the incident occurred, it was too remote in time to be relevant. Finally, he claims that the evidence was unreliable and prejudicial because there was no evidence that he owned a Glock handgun in 1995.\n   </p>\n   <p id=\"p-47\">\n    We conclude that the trial court did not abuse its discretion when it allowed the state to question the defendant about the incident involving Febles. The evidence was relevant to prove intent and the absence of mistake or accident because of the substantial similarities between the incidents. Specifically, in both incidents, a woman with whom the defendant was romantically\n    involved had been absent from the residence that they shared under circumstances that caused the defendant to become upset and then, after the woman returned to the residence, the defendant produced a Glock handgun. Given these similarities, if the jury believed Febles' account that the defendant intentionally pinned her to the wall and held the gun to her head, it reasonably could have inferred that he followed the same pattern of behavior during the argument with the victim. Thus, the jury reasonably could have concluded that the evidence rebutted the defendant's testimony that the gun accidentally discharged while he was trying to put it in his bag.\n   </p>\n   <p id=\"p-48\">\n    We further conclude that, given the strong similarities between the two incidents and the strongly aberrational nature of the defendant's conduct-producing a gun during an argument with a domestic partner-the fourteen year gap between the incidents of misconduct did not render the evidence of the incident involving Febles irrelevant. With respect to the defendant's claim that the evidence was unreliable because Febles never reported the incident to the police before she gave the statement in 2012, the defendant does not provide the evidentiary basis for this representation. In any event, even if that is the case, Febles' failure to report the incident to the police immediately would not render the evidence inadmissible, but would be grist for the jury mill.\n   </p>\n   <p id=\"p-49\">\n    Finally, with respect to the defendant's claim that there was no evidence that he owned a Glock handgun in 1995, Febles' statement that he threatened her with a Glock handgun was, in and of itself, evidence that the jury was free to credit or discredit in light of the defendant's denial that he owned such a gun at the time that he was involved with Febles.\n    <footnotemark>\n     26\n    </footnotemark>\n    Moreover,\n    even if\n    the jury did not believe Febles' statement on that point, that would not render her statement irrelevant or unduly prejudicial because the brand of the gun that the defendant held to Febles' head was tangential to the evidence of the assault.

Moreover, the trial court and the parties treated the exchange between the prosecutor and the defendant as if it were evidence that the incident involving Febles occurred. Accordingly, it is appropriate for us to address the question of whether evidence of the incident was admissible.\n    </p>\n   </footnote>\n   <footnote label=\"25\">\n    <p id=\"p-89\">\n     See footnote 24 of this opinion. Because the trial court's ruling denying the defendant's motion in limine related to the information contained in Febles' statement to the police, and because we are addressing this issue because it may arise on remand, all subsequent references to the \"evidence\" in this opinion are to Febles' account of the 1995 incident, and not solely to the prosecutor's characterization of that account while questioning the defendant at the first trial.\n    </p>\n   </footnote>\n   <footnote label=\"26\">\n    <p id=\"p-90\">\n     The defendant appears to suggest that his inability to cross-examine Febles about the brand of the gun that she claims he held to her head rendered the evidence unduly prejudicial. The defendant's inability to cross-examine Febles presents a different issue, however, than the issue of whether the evidence of prior misconduct was admissible to prove intent or absence of mistake or accident. Specifically, the defendant's inability to cross-examine Febles implicates his rights under the confrontation clause of the sixth amendment. Because the defendant has raised no claim under the confrontation clause on appeal, we express no opinion as to whether allowing the prosecutor to question the defendant about Febles' statement without providing an opportunity for the defendant to cross-examine Febles violated that constitutional provision or whether the defendant waived that right.\n    </p>\n   </footnote>\n   <footnote label=\"27\">\n    <p id=\"p-91\">\n     The concurring justice concludes that the trial court abused its discretion when it ruled that the evidence concerning the incident with Febles was admissible because: (1) the prior misconduct occurred fourteen years before the charged conduct; and (2) the prior misconduct was not against the victim of the charged misconduct and it did not involve a completed crime. Indeed, the concurrence suggests that it is an abuse of discretion to admit prior misconduct evidence to prove intent or the absence of accident or mistake\n     <em>\n      whenever\n     </em>\n     the latter circumstances are present. We conclude that there is no basis in the law of this state for such a conclusion, at least not in cases in which the defendant has claimed that the harm to the victim was not intentional. Rather, we conclude that when, (1) under circumstances that are similar to those involved in the case under review, (2) a defendant has threatened a person who is similar to the victim in the case under review (3) with harm that is similar to the harm inflicted on that victim, a fact finder reasonably could conclude that the defendant has displayed a particular \"pattern of behavior and an attitude ... that is indicative of the defendant's state of mind\" during the commission of the charged offense.\n     <em>\n      State\n     </em>\n     v.\n     <em>\n      Tucker\n     </em>\n     , supra,\n     <extracted-citation case-ids=\"1952731\" index=\"184\" url=\"https://cite.case.law/conn/181/406/#p415\">\n      181 Conn. at 415\n     </extracted-citation>\n     ,\n     <extracted-citation index=\"185\" url=\"https://cite.case.law/citations/?q=435%20A.2d%20986\">\n      435 A.2d 986\n     </extracted-citation>\n     ; see also\n     <em>\n      Johnson\n     </em>\n     v.\n     <em>\n      State\n     </em>\n     ,\n     <extracted-citation case-ids=\"12151350\" index=\"186\" url=\"https://cite.case.law/so3d/204/763/#p769\">\n      204 So.3d 763\n     </extracted-citation>\n     , 769 (Miss. 2016) (when defendant who was charged with committing aggravated domestic violence on former wife claimed that he acted in self-defense, trial court properly admitted evidence that he had threatened to kill his former wife with gun, and later threatened to kill a former girlfriend, to show intent, motive and plan because \"the prior assaults all were against women, where he was the aggressor ... he had initiated the contact [and] he had a prior relationship with all of the women\"). Indeed, the fact that a threat is not a \"completed crime\" in the sense that the defendant has actually inflicted physical injury on the threatened person does not mean that the threat does not reveal a violent, and potentially criminal, state of mind. Accordingly, we cannot conclude that evidence of a prior threat is inadmissible to prove intent or the absence of mistake or accident merely because the threat did not rise to the same level of violence or criminality as the defendant's alleged conduct in the case under review, although the defendant is certainly free to argue that his past conduct shows that he does not carry out his threats.

Accordingly, we conclude that the trial court here did not abuse its discretion when it determined that the jury reasonably could conclude that the evidence that the defendant had previously threatened to shoot a domestic partner in the head with a Glock handgun during an argument tended to rebut the defendant's claim that the victim in the present case was shot in the head during an argument with the defendant when the Glock handgun that he was holding accidentally discharged as he was attempting to place it in his bag.\n    </p>\n   </footnote>\n  </p>\n  <p type=\"concurrence\">\n   <author id=\"p-51\">\n    McDONALD, J., concurring.\n   </author>\n   <p id=\"p-52\">\n    I agree with the majority that the verdicts were legally inconsistent and must be vacated.

The defendant was incarcerated for eleven of those years, however ....\"). The majority concludes that the act of producing a gun during an argument with a domestic partner is sufficiently aberrant and similar to render the fourteen year period irrelevant. In my view, there are at least two material dissimilarities that, when viewed in conjunction with the fourteen year period, sufficiently reduce the probative value of that evidence as to the issue of an accidental discharge to warrant its exclusion. First, the defendant never discharged his gun in his argument with Febles. Although the defendant's action toward Febles rightly should be viewed as an implicit threat, the defendant never followed through, or attempted to follow through, with action then or thereafter.\n    <footnotemark>\n     2\n    </footnotemark>\n    Thus, its relevance to his intent to shoot his wife is tenuous.
