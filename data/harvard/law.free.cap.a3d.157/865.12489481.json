The State appeals from orders dismissing indictments against Melvin Hester (Hester),\n   Mark Warner (Warner), Anthony McKinney (McKinney), and Linwood Roundtree (Roundtree) (collectively defendants) charging them with third-degree violations of their special sentences of community supervision for life (CSL),\n   <em>\n    N.J.S.A.\n   </em>\n   2C:43-6.4(d). The State maintains that the trial judges who entered the orders erred by relying on the Ex Post Facto Clauses.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-15\">\n   Defendants committed their original or predicate crimes, which led to the imposition of special CSL sentences, prior to 2014.

The 2014 amended law, as applied to defendants, increased the punishment for defendants' predicate crimes if they subsequently violated the conditions of their CSL sentence.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-16\">\n   In determining whether the 2014 amended law \"make[s] more burdensome the punishment for a crime, after its commission,\" the narrow legal issue is whether the \"crime\" refers to the commission of the predicate offense or the violation of a condition of CSL.\n   <em>\n    State v.

We hold that the commission of the predicate crime, for which defendants received the special sentence of CSL, is the operative \"crime\" for determining whether the 2014 amended law violates the Ex Post Facto Clauses. Because the 2014 amended law retroactively increased defendants' punishment for committing their predicate crimes by raising the degree of the CSL violations from a fourth degree to a third degree, mandating the imposition of Parole Supervision for Life (PSL), and subjecting them to extended prison terms, the trial courts in these cases properly relied on the Ex Post Facto Clauses and dismissed the indictments. Accordingly, we affirm the orders under review.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-17\">\n   I.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-18\">\n   We begin by generally addressing the penal post-sentence supervisory schemes of CSL and PSL, setting forth the legal\n   principles governing the Ex Post Facto Clauses, and summarizing the facts leading to these appeals.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-19\">\n   (a)\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-20\">\n   The Legislature has described CSL, which is punitive in nature, as a \"special sentence.\"\n   <em>\n    N.J.S.A.\n   </em>\n   2C:43-6.4(a). The purpose of CSL is to protect the public from recidivism by sexual offenders. CSL is a component of the Violent Predator Incapacitation Act,\n   <em>\n    N.J.S.A.\n   </em>\n   2C:43-6.4, which is also a component of a series of laws commonly known as \"Megan's Law.\"\n   <footnotemark>\n    1\n   </footnotemark>\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-21\">\n   <em>\n    State v.

Megan's Law was in effect at the time defendants committed their predicate sexual offenses for which the court imposed CSL as part of their special sentence. An offender subject to CSL is required to abide by twenty-three enumerated \"general conditions.\"\n   <em>\n    N.J.A.C.\n   </em>\n   10A:71-6.11(b). Pursuant to\n   <em>\n    N.J.A.C.\n   </em>\n   10A:71-6.11, the Parole Board is obligated to supervise defendants who are subject to CSL.\n   <em>\n    Perez, supra\n   </em>\n   ,\n   <extracted-citation case-ids=\"4082756\" index=\"7\" url=\"https://cite.case.law/nj/220/423/#p436\">\n    220\n    <em>\n     N.J.\n    </em>\n    at 437\n   </extracted-citation>\n   ,\n   <extracted-citation case-ids=\"4082756\" index=\"8\" url=\"https://cite.case.law/nj/220/423/#p436\">\n    106\n    <em>\n     A\n    </em>\n    .3d 1212\n   </extracted-citation>\n   .\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-22\">\n   In 2003, the Legislature amended the law (the 2003 amendment) and replaced all references to CSL with PSL for individuals convicted of certain sexual offenses enumerated within\n   <em>\n    N.J.S.A.\n   </em>\n   2C:43-6.4(a).\n   <em>\n    Ibid.; see also\n   </em>\n   <em>\n    J.B. v.

Like CSL, PSL protects the public from recidivism by sexual offenders. The 2003 amendment provided that \"the custodial term imposed upon the defendant related to the special sentence of [PSL] shall be deemed to be a term of life imprisonment.\"\n   <em>\n    N.J.S.A.\n   </em>\n   2C:43-6.4(b). PSL therefore enhanced the penal exposure of certain persons previously sentenced to CSL. It did so by allowing the Parole Board to return offenders to prison for violating their parole, rather than exposing them to committing a separate fourth-degree crime, and by exposing\n   such individuals to mandatory extended prison terms if they committed certain predicate offenses.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-23\">\n   The 2014 amended law further increased the penal exposure of those individuals, like defendants, who had previously committed a predicate crime and had received a special sentence for CSL. The 2014 amended law provided in part that\n  </p>\n  <blockquote id=\"p-24\">\n   a. [A] judge imposing sentence on a person who has been convicted of [certain enumerated crimes]\n   <em>\n    shall include\n   </em>\n   , in addition to any sentence authorized by this Code, a special sentence of [\n   <em>\n    PSL\n   </em>\n   ].\n  </blockquote>\n  <blockquote id=\"p-25\">\n   ....\n  </blockquote>\n  <blockquote id=\"p-26\">\n   d. A person who violates a condition of a special sentence of [CSL] or [PSL] imposed pursuant to this section ... is\n   <em>\n    guilty of a crime of the third degree\n   </em>\n   .... [A] person sentenced pursuant to this subsection shall be sentenced to a term of imprisonment, unless the court is clearly convinced that the interests of justice so far outweigh the need to deter this conduct and the interest in public safety that a sentence to imprisonment would be a manifest injustice.\n  </blockquote>\n  <blockquote id=\"p-27\">\n   [\n   <em>\n    N.J.S.A.\n   </em>\n   2C:43-6.4 (emphasis added).]\n  </blockquote>\n  <p id=\"p-28\">\n   Thus, the 2014 amended law made more burdensome the punishment for the commission of the predicate crimes defendants committed before 2014. Defendants, who had been sentenced to CSL before the effective date of the 2014 amended law, were now subject to a prison term of three to five years, instead of eighteen months. They also faced the mandatory imposition of extended prison terms and PSL which, unlike the remedial registration and notification requirements of Megan's Law, is considered to be a penal post-sentence supervisory scheme.\n   <em>\n    See\n   </em>\n   <em>\n    Perez,\n    <extracted-citation case-ids=\"4082756\" index=\"13\" url=\"https://cite.case.law/nj/220/423/#p436\">\n     supra\n    </extracted-citation>\n   </em>\n   ,\n   <extracted-citation case-ids=\"4082756\" index=\"14\" url=\"https://cite.case.law/nj/220/423/#p436\">\n    220\n    <em>\n     N.J.\n    </em>\n    at 441\n   </extracted-citation>\n   ,\n   <extracted-citation case-ids=\"4082756\" index=\"15\" url=\"https://cite.case.law/nj/220/423/#p436\">\n    106\n    <em>\n     A\n    </em>\n    .3d 1212\n   </extracted-citation>\n   .\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-29\">\n   (b)\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-30\">\n   The United States Constitution provides that \"[n]o State shall ... pass any ... ex post facto Law ....\"\n   <em>\n    U.S. Const.\n   </em>\n   art.

They asserted that the 2014 amended law increased their penal exposure for violating their pre-2014 CSL sentences. Defendants argued that before the effective date of the 2014 amended law, violations of CSL constituted\n   fourth-degree offenses. They contended that the 2014 amended law raised the penalty for CSL violations to a third-degree crime and added the imposition of PSL. As a result, defendants urged the trial judges who heard the motions to dismiss the indictments as violating the Ex Post Facto Clauses of the United States and New Jersey Constitutions. The judges agreed, granted the motions to dismiss, and entered the orders under review.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-43\">\n   II.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-44\">\n   On appeal, the State argues that the court erred by dismissing the indictments because the 2014 amended law does not violate the Ex Post Facto Clauses of the Federal and State Constitutions. The State\n   treats defendants' alleged post-2014 violations of CSL, rather than the predicate offenses that originally led to the imposition of CSL, as the \"crimes\" for purposes of conducting its ex post facto analysis. As a result, the State contends that application of the 2014 amended law does not make more burdensome the punishment for the commission of a \"crime.\"\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-45\">\n   The State concedes, however, that defendants received their CSL special sentences for committing predicate crimes before the effective date of the 2014 amended law, and that defendants had faced only a fourth-degree offense for any pre-2014 violation of their CSL. For ex post facto purposes, it logically follows therefore that if the commission of the predicate offense is the \"crime,\" instead of the CSL violations as the State maintains, then the 2014 amended law increased the defendants' punishment. The punishment for committing a predicate crime, as a result of a pre-2014 CSL violation, was limited to fourth-degree exposure; but as applied, the 2014 amended law increased the punishment for committing the predicate offense, as a result of a post-2014 CSL violation, to third-degree exposure, PSL, and imposition of a mandatory extended prison term for the commission of certain predicate offenses.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-46\">\n   Although we generally review for an abuse of discretion a court's decision on whether to dismiss an indictment,\n   <em>\n    see, e.g.,\n   </em>\n   <em>\n    State v.
