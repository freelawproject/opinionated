In it, the petitioner alleged ineffective assistance of his trial counsel,\n   <footnotemark>\n    4\n   </footnotemark>\n   R. Bruce Lorenzen, at trial, that he was actually innocent, and that his due process rights were violated\n   due to the use of perjured testimony. After a two day habeas trial in December, 2014, the habeas court issued a memorandum of decision denying, in part, the petitioner's petition for a writ of habeas corpus. This appeal followed. Additional facts will be set forth as necessary.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-12\">\n   I\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-13\">\n   The petitioner first claims that the habeas court improperly concluded that Lorenzen provided effective assistance of counsel. Specifically, he argues that his counsel was deficient by failing (1) to request limiting\n   instructions regarding the introduction of prior misconduct evidence; (2) to present exculpatory evidence, namely, a tape of the victim's mother's 911 call, which allegedly would have undermined her trial testimony; and (3) to present exculpatory witnesses who could impeach the victim's testimony that she was not involved in a romantic relationship with the petitioner during the summer of 2009, when the incident occurred. The respondent, the Commissioner of Correction, argues that the habeas court properly denied the second amended petition because the petitioner's claim of ineffective assistance of counsel overlooks \"the fact that counsel's overall performance, which resulted in a finding of not guilty as to two of the four charges faced by the petitioner, indicates that counsel rendered effective and capable advocacy\" and fails to afford \"the proper level of deference to counsel's strategic decisions ... [in] an attempt to second-guess counsel's trial tactics after an adverse result.\" We agree with the respondent and affirm the court's determination that the petitioner's trial counsel provided effective assistance.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-14\">\n   We begin by setting forth our standard of review. \"The habeas court is afforded broad discretion in making its factual findings, and those findings will not be disturbed unless they are clearly erroneous.... The application of the habeas court's factual findings to the pertinent legal standard, however, presents a mixed question of law and fact, which is subject to plenary review.\" (Internal quotation marks omitted.)\n   <em>\n    Horn\n   </em>\n   v.\n   <em>\n    Commissioner of Correction\n   </em>\n   ,\n   <extracted-citation case-ids=\"12485086\" index=\"8\" url=\"https://cite.case.law/a3d/138/908/#p775\">\n    321 Conn. 767\n   </extracted-citation>\n   , 775,\n   <extracted-citation case-ids=\"12485086\" index=\"9\" url=\"https://cite.case.law/a3d/138/908/#p775\">\n    138 A.3d 908\n   </extracted-citation>\n   (2016).\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-15\">\n   The legal principles that govern an ineffective assistance claim are well settled.

The respondent, in turn, argues that the habeas court did not err in concluding that counsel exercised a reasonable trial strategy in not seeking a limiting instruction. We conclude that the petitioner cannot prove prejudice, and, therefore, the habeas court did not err in its determination that Lorenzen did not provide ineffective assistance of counsel.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-21\">\n   \"Proper limiting instructions often mitigate the prejudicial impact of evidence of prior misconduct.\"\n   <em>\n    State\n   </em>\n   v.\n   <em>\n    Ryan\n   </em>\n   ,\n   <extracted-citation case-ids=\"1954110\" index=\"24\" url=\"https://cite.case.law/conn/182/335/\">\n    182 Conn. 335\n   </extracted-citation>\n   , 338 n.5,\n   <extracted-citation index=\"25\" url=\"https://cite.case.law/citations/?q=438%20A.2d%20107\">\n    438 A.2d 107\n   </extracted-citation>\n   (1980). The petitioner argues that prior misconduct testimony was \"pervasive throughout the trial\" and a limiting instruction should have been given. Specifically, he notes that when the victim testified about her April, 2009 breakup with him, she described how the petitioner took both of her cell phones and broke them in half and slapped her in the face.\n   <footnotemark>\n    5\n   </footnotemark>\n   The victim and her mother testified that, after that incident, her mother called the police, and the petitioner was subsequently arrested. A no contact order between the victim and the petitioner was imposed as a condition of his subsequent probation. The petitioner also notes that the victim's mother testified that the victim \"was scared of [the petitioner].... He ... had been in jail.\" Officer John Zweibelson, the lead investigator in the April, 2009 incident, testified that during that incident he had seized a lighter that he initially thought was a gun.\n   <footnotemark>\n    6\n   </footnotemark>\n   Finally, responding Officer Robert Quaglini testified: \"Well, we\n   got [the petitioner's] name, date of birth, and we were able to pull up a picture-his [Department of Correction] picture on the computer within the cruiser.\" The petitioner claims that this information \"clearly inform[ed] the jury that [the petitioner] ha[d] been previously arrested, convicted, and sentenced\" and that \"the jury was then aware that the subject conviction involved the [victim].\"\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-22\">\n   The petitioner argues that the use of such prior misconduct evidence was \"inherently prejudicial\" and necessitated a limiting instruction.

In\n   <em>\n    Huckabee\n   </em>\n   , this court determined that the state's introduction of evidence of a defendant's prior escapes from a juvenile detention center was proper after the defendant \"opened the door to such inquiry,\" but that the \"introduction of the ... escapes prior to this prosecution, however, should have been accompanied by a limiting instruction that the evidence was to be used solely for the purpose of evaluating the defendant's veracity\" and that the \"nature of this evidence ... requires a limiting instruction.\"\n   <extracted-citation index=\"30\" url=\"https://cite.case.law/citations/?q=682%20A.2d%201009\">\n    Id.\n   </extracted-citation>\n   The petitioner fails to recognize, however, that in\n   <em>\n    Huckabee\n   </em>\n   , which was a direct criminal appeal, not a habeas action, the defendant raised an evidentiary claim that required him to prove that it was \"reasonably probable that the jury was misled by the failure to give a limiting instruction.\" Id. at 575,\n   <extracted-citation index=\"31\" url=\"https://cite.case.law/citations/?q=677%20A.2d%20452\">\n    677 A.2d 452\n   </extracted-citation>\n   . Here, the petitioner is not making an evidentiary claim. Rather, he is claiming that Lorenzen provided ineffective assistance of counsel and that claim requires a standard different from the claim in\n   <em>\n    Huckabee\n   </em>\n   . Instead of\n   determining whether it was \"reasonably probable that the jury was misled\" by the lack of a limiting instruction, we are charged with the two prong\n   <em>\n    Strickland\n   </em>\n   standard and may decide the matter against the petitioner on either the performance or the prejudice prong.\n   <em>\n    Lewis\n   </em>\n   v.\n   <em>\n    Commissioner of Correction\n   </em>\n   , supra,\n   <extracted-citation case-ids=\"12485142\" index=\"32\" url=\"https://cite.case.law/a3d/139/759/#p451\">\n    165 Conn.App. at 451\n   </extracted-citation>\n   ,\n   <extracted-citation case-ids=\"12485142\" index=\"33\" url=\"https://cite.case.law/a3d/139/759/#p451\">\n    139 A.3d 759\n   </extracted-citation>\n   .\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-23\">\n   In the present case, we conclude that the petitioner's claim fails because the state's case against the petitioner was strong and thus the petitioner cannot demonstrate prejudice. There is no reasonable probability that, had evidence of the petitioner's prior misconduct not been introduced, or had its introduction been properly limited, the outcome of the trial would have been different. A reasonable jury could have found the petitioner guilty on the basis of the other, non-prior misconduct evidence presented at trial even if the evidence of the petitioner's prior misconduct was not introduced or was properly limited.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-24\">\n   Quaglini testified that he and Officer Robert Iovanna, the other responding officer, went to 104 Ward Street in search of the petitioner after interviewing the victim and observed the petitioner standing on the front steps. Upon approaching the petitioner, the petitioner \"made eye contact and he immediately spun around [and] ripped the door open.\" Quaglini stated that he ordered the petitioner to stop, but the petitioner did not comply and instead \"ran up the stairs.\" Quaglini \"chased him up the stairs into the apartment, ran through the apartment down the back stairs out of the back of the house [and] ran back around to Ward Street.\" Quaglini further testified that the petitioner was \"hopping fences\" and running through backyards in an effort to evade him. Quaglini followed him to a parking lot located at 913 Broad Street and found the petitioner hiding under a motor vehicle.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-25\">\n   A struggle ensued. The officers attempted to pull the petitioner out by the feet, but they had to strike him with Quaglini's baton in order to extract him and place him in handcuffs. Zweibelson then transported the victim to the scene to identify the petitioner. Zweibelson testified that, when he arrived with the victim, the petitioner, without prompting, \"stated that he didn't do it and that he just wanted ... to be with her and that ... they did have a verbal argument, altercation that night over ... the state of the relationship.\" Further, Officer John Hernandez, another responding police officer, testified that he observed injuries to the victim, including bruising to her neck.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-26\">\n   Therefore, the physical evidence of the bruises on the victim's neck and the petitioner's own actions and statements made the state's case strong.

According to the petitioner, the 911 tape would have undermined the mother's\n   testimony because of the discrepancies between her testimony and the actual 911 tape. The respondent argues that because the petitioner never asked Lorenzen about the 911 tape during the habeas trial, the petitioner failed to satisfy his burden of proof with respect to this claim of ineffective assistance of counsel. The court concluded that, due to the absence of any evidence that would explain why Lorenzen did not use the tape, the petitioner failed to meet his burden of proof. We agree with the court and reject the petitioner's claim.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-30\">\n   The following additional facts are relevant to our discussion. At trial, the victim's mother testified to the following: \"I told the police that I had a big argument with my daughter and that it was so big that she got so upset she left the house. I didn't know what to do. I needed them to come home immediately because the fight was so big I don't know-I didn't understand what-where-where it was going to, but the police didn't believe me.\" Additionally, she testified that \"I was trying to talk low, and they kept telling me you have to speak louder, and I told them I couldn't do that ... I think that's what ... got them to come so fast.\" The petitioner argues in his brief that a review of the 911 tape recording of the conversation between the victim's mother and the dispatcher \"reveals that the [victim's] mother did not request that the police come to her house, instead she told them everything was fine. Further, the dispatcher did not 'keep telling' the [victim's] mother to 'speak louder.' To the contrary, at\n   <em>\n    no\n   </em>\n   point did the dispatcher tell the [victim's] mother to 'speak louder.' \" (Emphasis original.) He further emphasizes that the victim's mother testified that the police arrived at her house \" 'less than five minutes' \" after she terminated the 911 call, but that the Heartbeat Dispatch Summary indicates that the police did not arrive at the victim's mother's residence until an hour and a half after the call.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-31\">\n   The habeas court found that \"[a]t the habeas trial, Attorney Lorenzen was not asked whether he obtained or listened to the 911 [tape] prior to or during the criminal trial, or if he did have it, why he did not use it to cross-examine the victim's mother.\" Despite the respondent's argument to the contrary, a petitioner is not always required to call counsel at his habeas trial to present evidence to explain counsel's strategy on appeal.

Lorenzen did, in fact, utilize the discrepancy between the amount of time that the victim's mother testified that it took the police to arrive at her residence and their actual arrival time to impeach the victim's mother at trial. Specifically, Lorenzen elicited testimony from Zweibelson that directly contradicted part of the victim's mother's testimony regarding her call to the police. Moreover, during his thorough cross-examination of the victim's mother, Lorenzen elicited testimony that she had lied to the police. The petitioner argues in his brief that \"[e]ffective assistance would have thus required that defense counsel utilize the [911] recording as impeachment,\" but he also admits that Lorenzen did just that at trial. Thus, the petitioner has failed to demonstrate how he was harmed by counsel's failure to offer the 911 tape, as it is clear Lorenzen was effective in impeaching the victim's mother's testimony without it. \"\n   <em>\n    Strickland\n   </em>\n   does not guarantee perfect representation, only a reasonably competent attorney. ...

The respondent replies that the habeas court properly resolved the foregoing claim on the basis of a credibility determination that the petitioner had failed to provide Lorenzen with names of witnesses he alleges Lorenzen should have called. We agree with the respondent and, accordingly, reject the petitioner's argument.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-37\">\n   The following additional facts are necessary for the resolution of this argument. During the underlying criminal trial, the victim testified that she and the petitioner were not in a romantic relationship during the summer of 2009, that they had no physical contact with each other, and that she feared the petitioner.

After reviewing a copy of the police report, the petitioner informed Lorenzen that the victim's statement that she and the petitioner were not in a romantic relationship in the summer of 2009 was a lie. Lorenzen testified at the habeas trial that the petitioner had not provided him with any of the above witness names prior to the criminal trial. During the pretrial investigation, the petitioner provided Lorenzen with the names of only two witnesses, Nancy Gonzalez and Melania Alverez, to testify that he and the victim were in a romantic relationship. Lorenzen was unable to locate them. The habeas court determined that the petitioner, \"who knew or should have known of these other witnesses, failed to tell [Lorenzen] about them.\"\n   \"Defense counsel will be deemed ineffective only when it is shown that a defendant has informed his attorney of the existence of the witness and that the attorney, without a reasonable investigation and without adequate explanation, failed to call the witness at trial.\"\n   <em>\n    Gaines\n   </em>\n   v.\n   <em>\n    Commissioner of Correction\n   </em>\n   ,\n   <extracted-citation index=\"49\" url=\"https://cite.case.law/citations/?q=306%20Conn.%20664\">\n    306 Conn. 664\n   </extracted-citation>\n   , 681,\n   <extracted-citation index=\"50\" url=\"https://cite.case.law/citations/?q=51%20A.3d%20948\">\n    51 A.3d 948\n   </extracted-citation>\n   (2012). \"The reasonableness of counsel's actions may be determined or substantially influenced by the defendant's own statements or actions.

Accordingly, we agree with the habeas court that the petitioner has failed to prove that Lorenzen's\n   conduct was deficient in failing to procure the previously mentioned witnesses.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-39\">\n   II\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-40\">\n   The petitioner next claims that the habeas court improperly rejected his claim of actual innocence. According to the petitioner, if the witnesses he alleged should have been presented at his criminal trial had testified, their testimony would have demonstrated that the victim had been living with him at the time that she alleged she was kidnapped. The respondent argues that the habeas court, in its role as fact finder, properly rejected the petitioner's claim of actual innocence because the petitioner's evidence was insufficient to meet the high burden of proving his actual innocence by clear and convincing evidence. We agree with the respondent, and, accordingly,\n   reject the petitioner's claim of actual innocence for two reasons; first, the witnesses presented at the habeas trial did not constitute newly discovered evidence, and second, the petitioner does not satisfy the high standard for a claim of proof of actual innocence.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-41\">\n   We begin our analysis by setting forth the relevant legal principles and standard of review that governs our analysis. \"To prevail [on a claim of actual innocence], a petitioner must satisfy two criteria.

First, the habeas court found that this evidence was not newly discovered because the petitioner's witnesses were known, or should have been known to him, at the time of the petitioner's criminal trial. Second, the court found that these witnesses were not exculpatory, as none of them witnessed the events at issue on August 27 and 28, 2009. To support this conclusion, the court observed that \"[o]nly [Gonzalez] was present\n   in the house that night but he only provided limited testimony concerning the events of the evening and his testimony does not prove that the petitioner is actually innocent, nor does it undermine the victim's testimony about the events.\"\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-47\">\n   Upon a thorough review of the record, we conclude that Gonzalez' testimony does not directly contradict the victim's testimony. Gonzalez testified that although he did not see the petitioner use force on the victim, she ran into his room at 4 a.m. and stated \"please help me, [the petitioner] won't let me go home.\" He also testified that the petitioner refused to give the victim's baby back to her. Thus, Gonzalez' testimony could support a finding that the petitioner was holding her against her will.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-48\">\n   The petitioner further argues that the elements of kidnapping cannot be met here, and that \"by law, [the petitioner] is actually innocent of kidnapping in the second degree.\" Again, we disagree.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-49\">\n   General Statutes \u00a7 53a-94 (a) provides that \"[a] person is guilty of kidnapping in the second degree when he abducts another person.\" \" 'Abduct' \" means \"to restrain a person with intent to prevent his liberation by either (A) secreting or holding him in a place where\n   he is not likely to be found, or (B) using or threatening to use physical force or intimidation.\" General Statutes \u00a7 53a-91 (2). Here, the victim's words coupled with evidence that the petitioner refused to give her back her baby is enough to constitute abduction in the form of \"intimidation.\" The habeas court was well within its power as fact finder to conclude that Gonzalez' testimony, and that of all the other witnesses who testified at the habeas trial, did not present clear and convincing evidence of the petitioner's actual innocence. Moreover, our review of the record demonstrates that the evidence before the habeas court was, at the least, \"loose, equivocal or contradictory,\" from which no habeas relief can exist.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-50\">\n   On the basis of the record before us, we agree with the habeas court that the petitioner has failed to establish by clear and convincing evidence that he is actually innocent because he has failed to produce new evidence at his habeas trial and has not met the high burden of proof necessary to sustain a claim of actual innocence.\n   <footnotemark>\n    13\n   </footnotemark>\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-51\">\n   <em>\n    Corbett\n   </em>\n   v.\n   <em>\n    Commissioner of Correction\n   </em>\n   , supra,\n   <extracted-citation case-ids=\"4072267\" index=\"64\" url=\"https://cite.case.law/conn-app/133/310/#p314\">\n    133 Conn.App. at 314-15\n   </extracted-citation>\n   ,\n   <extracted-citation index=\"65\" url=\"https://cite.case.law/citations/?q=34%20A.3d%201046\">\n    34 A.3d 1046\n   </extracted-citation>\n   ;\n   <em>\n    Vazquez\n   </em>\n   v.\n   <em>\n    Commissioner of Correction\n   </em>\n   , supra,\n   <extracted-citation case-ids=\"4242651\" index=\"66\" url=\"https://cite.case.law/conn-app/128/425/#p444\">\n    128 Conn.App. at 444\n   </extracted-citation>\n   ,\n   <extracted-citation index=\"67\" url=\"https://cite.case.law/citations/?q=17%20A.3d%201089\">\n    17 A.3d 1089\n   </extracted-citation>\n   .\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-52\">\n   III\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-53\">\n   The petitioner's final claim is that the habeas court improperly concluded that his due process rights were not violated because his conviction was based, in part, on the allegedly perjured testimony of the victim and the victim's mother.
