Ames, appeals from the judgment of conviction, rendered after a trial before a three judge court, of murder in violation of General Statutes \u00a7 53a-54a. On appeal, the defendant claims that the court improperly (1) concluded that she failed to prove her affirmative defense of extreme emotional disturbance by a fair preponderance of the evidence, (2) concluded that the state had disproven her self-defense claim beyond a reasonable doubt, (3) concluded that the state had established that she possessed\n   the specific intent to cause the victim's death beyond a reasonable doubt, and (4) interrupted and questioned counsel during the parties' closing arguments in violation of her right to the assistance of counsel. We affirm the judgment of the court.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-10\">\n   After a trial, the court found the following facts. \"At approximately 12:56 a.m., on May 24, 2010, at Doran's Bar, located at 80 Old Broadway in North Haven, [the victim] Christopher Hall, a bartender employed by the bar, died of a stab wound to the heart. The fatal wound was inflicted by a knife with a blade approximately\n   three and one-half inches in length. The knife was wielded by [the defendant].\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-11\">\n   \"The bar contains two rooms significant to this case, a poolroom and a barroom. Five people were in these rooms at the time of the stabbing, [the victim], [the defendant], [the defendant's] adult son, Michael Ames, Nicholas Moalli, a customer of the bar, and Joseph Iezzi, a friend of [the victim's] who had recently arrived to drive him home at the end of the shift. Of these five people, at least three, [the victim], [the defendant], and Iezzi, had been drinking heavily, and the remaining two, Moalli and Michael Ames, had been drinking at least moderately. It is safe to assume that alcohol played at least some role in the tragedy that happened. ...\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-12\">\n   \"[The victim] was working the night shift at the bar and was the sole employee on the premises. At approximately 11:15 p.m. on May 23, 2010, the defendant and her son arrived at the bar. They had already been drinking heavily and began to drink more at the bar. Moalli arrived at approximately 11:30, and the four occupants of the bar proceeded ... to drink beer and shots.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-13\">\n   \"At approximately midnight, the four occupants moved from the barroom into the poolroom to play pool. Two teams were formed. [The defendant] and [the victim] formed one team, and Michael Ames and Moalli formed the other. The defendant believed that a wager was made. In her mind, the members of the losing team in two of three games would buy shots for each member of the winning team.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-14\">\n   \"The team of Michael Ames and Moalli won the first two games. Iezzi arrived shortly before the end of the match. Iezzi and Moalli stayed in the poolroom. [The victim] returned to the barroom followed by [the defendant] and Michael Ames. Although [the defendant] had been a member of the losing team, she was determined\n   to claim the proceeds of the bet for her son. She specifically was determined to pour a shot of tequila. [The victim] resisted.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-15\">\n   \"Autopsy findings established that [the victim] was punched in the face and kicked in the groin. The totality of all the evidence persuades us that both [the defendant] and Michael Ames took part in this assault.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-16\">\n   \"[The defendant's] statement to the police and her testimony to the court establish that during the struggle, she initially hit [the victim] in the chest with a sheathed knife that she carried in a pocketbook. She then removed the sheath and inflicted several wounds on [the victim]. Some of these were defensive wounds to [the victim's] hands and wrist. The fatal wound was a stab to the heart. All of these wounds were consistent with the knife ... seized from the bar. The nature of these wounds convinces us that [the defendant] had the specific intent to kill [the victim] when she inflicted the fatal blow.\"\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-17\">\n   On the basis of the foregoing conduct, the state charged the defendant with (1) murder in violation of \u00a7 53a-54a, (2) felony murder in violation of General Statutes \u00a7 53a-54c, and (3) attempt to commit robbery in the first degree in violation of\n   General Statutes \u00a7\u00a7 53a-49(a)(2) and 53a-134(a)(2). The case was tried before a three judge court, which consisted of\n   <em>\n    Blue\n   </em>\n   ,\n   <em>\n    O'Keefe\n   </em>\n   , and\n   <em>\n    Keegan\n   </em>\n   ,\n   <em>\n    Js.\n   </em>\n   At trial, the defendant presented a claim of self-defense pursuant to General Statutes \u00a7 53a-19.\n   <footnotemark>\n    1\n   </footnotemark>\n   In the alternative, the defendant also\n   presented the affirmative defense of extreme emotional disturbance pursuant to \u00a7 53a-54a(a).\n   <footnotemark>\n    2\n   </footnotemark>\n   The court found the defendant guilty of murder, but not guilty of felony murder and attempt to commit robbery. The court rejected both the defendant's claim of self-defense and her defense of extreme emotional disturbance.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-18\">\n   After the judgment, the defendant filed motions wherein she requested that the court vacate its finding of guilty of murder and instead render judgment of guilty of manslaughter in the first degree in violation of General Statutes \u00a7 53a-55(a)(2) or (3), or, in the alternative, render judgment of acquittal.\n   <footnotemark>\n    3\n   </footnotemark>\n   The court denied those motions and sentenced the defendant to a period of thirty-five years of incarceration followed by ten years of special parole. This appeal followed. Additional facts will be provided as necessary.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-19\">\n   I\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-20\">\n   EXTREME EMOTIONAL DISTURBANCE\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-21\">\n   The defendant's first claim is that the court erroneously concluded that she failed to prove her affirmative\n   defense of extreme emotional disturbance by a fair preponderance of the evidence. In particular, she asserts that \"the record in this case is devoid of 'ample evidence' contradicting the claim.\" The state responds that the defendant failed to carry her burden of proving that she killed the victim under the influence of an extreme emotional disturbance. We agree with the state.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-22\">\n   We first set forth the relevant law and our standard of review. Section 53a-54a(a) provides in relevant part: \"[I]n any prosecution [for murder], it shall be an affirmative defense that the defendant committed the proscribed act or acts under the influence of extreme emotional disturbance for which there was a reasonable explanation\n   or excuse, the reasonableness of which is to be determined from the viewpoint of a person in the defendant's situation under the circumstances as the defendant believed them to be.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-23\">\n   \"[E]xtreme emotional disturbance is a mitigating circumstance which will reduce the crime of murder to manslaughter. ... Pursuant to General Statutes \u00a7 53a-12(b), [w]hen a defense declared to be an affirmative defense is raised at trial, the defendant shall have the burden of establishing such defense by a preponderance of the evidence. ... A homicide influenced by an extreme emotional disturbance ... is not one which is necessarily committed in the hot blood stage, but rather one that was brought about by a significant mental trauma that caused the defendant to brood for a long period of time and then react violently, seemingly without provocation.\" (Internal quotation marks omitted.)\n   <em>\n    State\n   </em>\n   v.\n   <em>\n    Cannon\n   </em>\n   ,\n   <extracted-citation case-ids=\"12484832\" index=\"0\" url=\"https://cite.case.law/a3d/138/1139/#p333\">\n    165 Conn.App. 324\n   </extracted-citation>\n   , 333-34,\n   <extracted-citation case-ids=\"12484832\" index=\"1\" url=\"https://cite.case.law/a3d/138/1139/#p333\">\n    138 A.3d 1139\n   </extracted-citation>\n   , cert. denied,\n   <extracted-citation case-ids=\"12484937,12484938,12484941\" index=\"2\" url=\"https://cite.case.law/conn/321/924/\">\n    321 Conn. 924\n   </extracted-citation>\n   ,\n   <extracted-citation case-ids=\"12484940,12484941,12484942\" index=\"3\" url=\"https://cite.case.law/a3d/138/285/\">\n    138 A.3d 285\n   </extracted-citation>\n   (2016).\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-24\">\n   Our Supreme Court has observed that \u00a7 53a-54a\"describes the two elements of that defense as: (1) the\n   defendant committed the offense under the influence of extreme emotional disturbance; and (2) there was a reasonable explanation or excuse for the defendant's extreme emotional disturbance.\"\n   <em>\n    State\n   </em>\n   v.\n   <em>\n    Forrest\n   </em>\n   ,\n   <extracted-citation case-ids=\"520797\" index=\"4\" url=\"https://cite.case.law/conn/216/139/#p148\">\n    216 Conn. 139\n   </extracted-citation>\n   , 148,\n   <extracted-citation index=\"5\" url=\"https://cite.case.law/citations/?q=578%20A.2d%201066\">\n    578 A.2d 1066\n   </extracted-citation>\n   (1990).\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-25\">\n   The first element requires the defendant to make three subsidiary factual showings: \"[T]he defendant must persuade the trier of fact that ...

Even if we were to hypothetically conclude that the defendant was exposed to extremely unusual and overwhelming stress, we cannot find that she had an extreme emotional reaction to\n   <em>\n    that\n   </em>\n   stress. While the evidence suggests that there was indeed stress in her personal life, we cannot find that her quarrel with [the victim], and her eventual killing of him, was a reaction to\n   <em>\n    that\n   </em>\n   stress. [The victim] had nothing to do with\n   <em>\n    that\n   </em>\n   personal stress. The killing was, rather, the result of a barroom brawl which the defendant herself had initiated.\" (Emphasis added.)\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-28\">\n   After reviewing the record and construing the evidence in the light most favorable to sustaining the court's finding of guilt, we conclude that the court's rejection of the defendant's affirmative defense of extreme emotional disturbance was reasonably supported by the evidence and the logical inferences drawn therefrom.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-29\">\n   To establish the defense that she acted under the influence of an extreme emotional disturbance, the defendant relied on her own testimony and the testimony of Catherine F. Lewis, an expert in forensic psychiatry. During her testimony, the defendant admitted to killing the victim, but she claimed that she had done so under the influence of an extreme emotional disturbance. She contended that her extreme emotional disturbance had two sources: (1) the altercation with the victim, and (2) several unrelated stressful circumstances in her life.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-30\">\n   Regarding the altercation with the victim, the defendant testified to the following.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-31\">\n   The defendant believed that she and the victim had made a wager in which\n   the losers of the pool match would buy drinks for the winners. When the match concluded, the defendant and the victim began to argue over whether the victim, having lost the match, would buy the defendant's son a drink. As the victim left the poolroom to return to the barroom, the defendant followed him and continued arguing with him. The victim repeatedly refused to buy the defendant's son a drink. The argument continued as the victim and the defendant exchanged profanities, and, according to the defendant, the victim eventually \"put his hands on [the defendant's] throat.\" The defendant testified that, when the victim touched her, it caused her to feel \"terrified,\" \"trapped,\" and \"like [she] was going to be hurt.\" She claimed that these feelings were largely due to prior unrelated incidents in which she allegedly was assaulted and raped. As a result of those incidents, the defendant claimed to have started carrying a knife in her pocketbook for self-protection. Because the victim's touching of her made her feel \"scared,\" \"upset,\" and \"[like] a mess,\" she \"freaked out,\" retrieved the knife from her pocketbook, and stabbed the victim in an effort to \"get away.\"\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-32\">\n   Regarding the other unrelated stressors in the defendant's life that contributed to her extreme emotional disturbance, she asserted that those included the following: (1) caring for her ill mother and managing her mother's finances, (2) losing her job, (3) ending a relationship with her boyfriend, and (4) relapsing into alcohol abuse after years of sobriety.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-33\">\n   The defendant also presented the testimony of Lewis to support her extreme emotional disturbance defense. Lewis, an expert in forensic psychiatry, testified that after interviewing the defendant and reviewing the defendant's background and psychiatric history, she diagnosed the defendant with chronic post-traumatic stress disorder. Lewis opined that the defendant's stress disorder primarily was caused by two incidents in which\n   the defendant claimed she previously had been assaulted and raped.\n   <footnotemark>\n    5\n   </footnotemark>\n   Furthermore, Lewis testified that a person suffering from this type of stress disorder is in a \"perpetual state of hyperarousal\" and responds to a threat in a manner \"way out of proportion to what it should be.\" As a result, Lewis opined, if the defendant \"truly believes she is at risk [physically], she would be at risk to respond with extreme force or whatever force it took to stop that risk from happening to her.\"\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-34\">\n   Regarding the defendant's altercation with the victim, Lewis agreed with defense counsel that the defendant told her that the victim \"had his hands physically touching her in some way.\" As a result of this physical contact, the defendant told Lewis, she felt \"trapped\" and that she stabbed the victim only because she believed that she had \"to get him off me.\"\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-35\">\n   On the basis of the defendant's account of her altercation with the victim, Lewis, in offering the following opinion, agreed with defense counsel that (1) the defendant \"was exposed to an extremely unusual and overwhelming stress\" at the \"time of [the] physical altercation\"; (2) the defendant had \"an extreme emotional reaction to the physical struggle between her and [the victim]\"; and (3) the defendant's \"ability to reason and act rational[ly] was overborne\n   by intense feelings.\"\n   <footnotemark>\n    6\n   </footnotemark>\n   The defendant's stress disorder, according to Lewis, was an \"important factor\" in concluding that the defendant had acted under the influence of an extreme emotional disturbance.\n   The state did not call its own expert witness. Instead, it sought to impeach Lewis' testimony on cross-examination by undermining both her stress disorder diagnosis and her opinion that the defendant acted under the influence of an extreme emotional disturbance. In particular, the state successfully elicited that Lewis had not sought and obtained collateral evidence concerning some of the defendant's background and psychiatric and medical history.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-36\">\n   The state also undertook a lengthy examination of how the defendant related the details of the altercation to Lewis. For instance, Lewis recalled that although the defendant claimed the victim \"grabbed her by the throat,\" Lewis did not ask the defendant to demonstrate exactly how the victim grabbed her. Furthermore, Lewis had \"trouble understanding\" how and where on the defendant's person the victim grabbed the defendant: \"I remember ... that [the victim] was not throttling her, and it wasn't clear to me, even in talking to her for some time ....\" \"[W]hen she was describing him putting his hands on her ... I could not elicit if it was throat or more ... shoulder.\"\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-37\">\n   Lewis also indicated that the defendant provided her with two different accounts of how the altercation occurred. In the first version, the defendant claimed that the victim \"reached across a bar\" and \"grabbed her by the throat,\" and, in the second version, the victim supposedly grabbed the defendant after the defendant had followed the victim behind the bar. Lewis acknowledged that she was aware of a third version that the defendant provided to the police, in which the defendant indicated that she lunged across the bar at the victim, struck him, tackled him, and stabbed him.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-38\">\n   As reflected in both the defendant's testimony and the testimony of her expert, the defendant's claim of extreme emotional disturbance was largely premised\n   on the crucial fact that her stress disorder was triggered when the victim grabbed her throat. The reasoning underlying the defendant's extreme emotional disturbance claim is as follows: (1) Lewis' expert testimony established that the defendant had been suffering from a severe stress disorder, namely, post-traumatic stress disorder, at the time of the incident; (2) Lewis' testimony also established that the defendant's stress disorder, when triggered, could cause the defendant to react in a violent and extreme manner; (3) according to Lewis, the defendant's stress disorder could be triggered when she felt physically at risk; (4) on the basis of the defendant's assertion that the victim grabbed her throat, in Lewis' opinion, the victim's actions triggered the defendant's stress disorder; and (5) therefore, this triggering of the defendant's stress disorder compelled her to react in an extreme and violent manner, and to stab the defendant under the influence of an extreme emotional disturbance.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-39\">\n   Importantly, however, the court did not make the factual finding that the victim grabbed the defendant's throat. Because this finding was a crucial factual premise upon which the defendant's extreme emotional disturbance defense was predicated,\n   the defendant's failure to prove it was fatal to that affirmative defense. Absent the finding that the victim had grabbed the defendant by the throat, the defendant failed to establish any connection between her post-traumatic stress disorder and her stabbing of the victim. As a result, she failed to carry her burden in showing that she had an extreme emotional reaction to her \"unusual and overwhelming state,\" which, the court hypothetically assumed, was her stress disorder. Thus, the court reasonably could have concluded that because the victim did not grab the defendant's throat, her stress disorder was not triggered and, therefore, that her stabbing of the victim simply was a reaction to \"a barroom brawl\n   [that] [she] herself had initiated,\" not a reaction to her stress disorder. Our review of the record reveals that there is ample evidence in the record to support this conclusion.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-40\">\n   The defendant testified that she instigated an argument with the victim because he refused to buy her son a drink that she believed the victim owed him. The defendant decided that \"[i]f [the victim] was not going to pour the drink for my son, I was going to pour the drink for my son.\" As the argument intensified, the defendant indicated in a statement to the police, she threatened the victim by telling him, \"I'll kick you[r] son-of-a-bitchen ass ....\" In that statement to the police, the defendant also disclosed that she eventually attacked the victim by lunging at him, tackling him, striking him, and stabbing him. Indeed, on the basis of this evidence, the court concluded that the defendant \"pursued the victim into the barroom, threatened him, and lunged at him ... [leaving] [the court] with no doubt that she was the initial aggressor.\"\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-41\">\n   Although the defendant argues that, in testifying at trial and talking to the police and to Lewis, she consistently alleged that the defendant grabbed her throat, the court was free to disbelieve this self-serving testimony. \"The trier of fact can disbelieve any or all of the evidence proffered concerning the defense of extreme emotional disturbance, including expert testimony, and can construe such evidence in a manner different from the defendant's assertions. ... In a case tried before a court, the [panel] is the sole arbiter of the credibility of the witnesses and the weight to be given specific testimony. ...

First, the court could have found that the defendant had a motive to kill the victim. The defendant's testimony and statement to the police indicated that she instigated an argument with the victim over a shot of tequila that she believed the victim owed to her son. The defendant was determined to claim her son's drink, stating that \"[i]f [the victim] was not going to pour the drink for my son, I was going to pour the drink for my son.\" In reaction to the victim's refusal to give the defendant's son a drink, the defendant told the victim, \"I'll kick you[r] son-of-a-bitchen ass ....\" Thereafter, some type of physical altercation ensued, in which the defendant lunged at, tackled, and struck the victim. The defendant concluded that because the victim was much taller than she is, she would have to lunge at him with her knife to overcome the size disadvantage.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-60\">\n   Second, the court reasonably could have found that in \"thrust[ing] [a] knife with great force and direct[ing]\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-61\">\n   ... blows to [the victim's] vital areas ... [the defendant] purposely sought to cause serious injury or death.\"\n   <em>\n    State\n   </em>\n   v.\n   <em>\n    Chace\n   </em>\n   , supra,\n   <extracted-citation case-ids=\"535689\" index=\"48\" url=\"https://cite.case.law/conn/199/102/#p104\">\n    199 Conn. at 106\n   </extracted-citation>\n   ,\n   <extracted-citation index=\"49\" url=\"https://cite.case.law/citations/?q=505%20A.2d%20712\">\n    505 A.2d 712\n   </extracted-citation>\n   .

Given that the heart undoubtedly is a vital area, the testimony of a state medical examiner that the defendant stabbed the victim in the chest with enough force to puncture his skin, soft tissue, cartilage, and heart afforded the court a strong basis from which it could infer an intent to kill.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-62\">\n   Additionally, the medical examiner testified that the victim also sustained, at the same time as the stabbing wound, defensive type wounds to his arms and wrists, and abrasions to his forehead, arms, lips, neck, legs, and penis. Such wounds suggest that the defendant intended to overcome the victim's resistance so that she could inflict a final and fatal blow.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-63\">\n   Third, because \"the defendant ... caused a grievous wound that could [have] cause[d] the victim's death if not treated promptly, [her] failure to summon that treatment [was] consistent with an antecedent intent to cause death.\" (Internal quotation marks omitted.)\n   <em>\n    State\n   </em>\n   v.\n   <em>\n    Otto\n   </em>\n   , supra,\n   <extracted-citation index=\"52\" url=\"https://cite.case.law/citations/?q=305%20Conn.%2051\">\n    305 Conn. at 71-72\n   </extracted-citation>\n   ,\n   <extracted-citation index=\"53\" url=\"https://cite.case.law/citations/?q=43%20A.3d%20629\">\n    43 A.3d 629\n   </extracted-citation>\n   . The court could have found that after she had stabbed the victim, the defendant immediately fled the bar and did not attempt to render aid to the victim or summon medical assistance. Indeed, the defendant, and her son, Michael Ames, ran to her car,\n   which was parked in Doran's parking lot, and Michael Ames drove them to the defendant's home.\n   Fourth, the state presented evidence that suggested that the defendant manifested a consciousness of guilt after the stabbing. The state's evidence showed that the defendant fled the bar after the stabbing and attempted to conceal the sheath of the knife somewhere in her home.

Moreover, as the police arrived at the defendant's home, they observed from their cruisers that the defendant was walking from the garage of her home to the front door. When the defendant turned her head and looked at the police cruisers, she \"quickened her pace\" and entered the home through the front door. Although the defendant testified that she was unaware that the police were at her home, the responding officers testified that they had attempted to make contact with the defendant for approximately thirty minutes by calling her home telephone, banging on the front door, and yelling loudly. The defendant never responded to the officers, and the officers were able to enter the house and apprehend the defendant only after using a battering ram to knock down the front door.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-64\">\n   Notwithstanding the foregoing, the defendant claims that she could not have formed the intent to kill the victim because she was intoxicated at the time of the stabbing. \"Intoxication, as used in General Statutes \u00a7 53a-7, means a substantial disturbance of mental or physical capacities resulting from the introduction of substances into the body. ...

The sole contested question is whether [the defendant] acted with intent to cause the death of another person. ... [T]he court has found that such intent has been proven beyond a reasonable doubt. ... [T]his finding has been made after a careful review of\n   <em>\n    all\n   </em>\n   the evidence in the case.\" (Emphasis in original; internal quotation marks omitted.)\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-68\">\n   Thus, we must conclude that the court, having considered all the evidence presented, simply did not believe that the defendant was so intoxicated that she could not form the specific intent to kill. We conclude that the court acted reasonably in so finding. To be sure, the court was presented with substantial evidence from which it could have inferred the defendant's intent to kill and from which it reasonably could have determined that her intoxication did not prevent her from forming the specific intent to kill the victim.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-69\">\n   Accordingly, we conclude that the cumulative effect of all the evidence adduced at trial and the inferences reasonably drawn therefrom amply support the trial court's conclusion that the defendant was able to and did form the specific intent to kill the victim.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-70\">\n   IV\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-71\">\n   COURT'S QUESTIONING OF COUNSEL DURING CLOSING ARGUMENT\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-72\">\n   The defendant's final claim is that she was deprived of her constitutional right to the assistance of counsel\n   when the court interrupted defense counsel during closing argument.\n   <footnotemark>\n    9\n   </footnotemark>\n   Specifically, the defendant asserts that the court's questioning was improper because it \"constituted presubmission deliberation\" that \"deprived the defendant of her right to have her counsel present her defense as she saw fit.\" The state responds that the defendant has failed to demonstrate that the court's questioning interfered with defense counsel's presentation of her closing argument. We agree with the state.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-73\">\n   The following additional facts are relevant to our review of the defendant's claim. During the parties' closing arguments, the court interrupted both the prosecutor and defense counsel to ask counsel questions. In particular, the court asked counsel to explicate their theories regarding (1) a broken pool cue found in Doran's poolroom, which the court deemed \"important\" evidence,\n   <footnotemark>\n    10\n   </footnotemark>\n   (2) the cause and\n   significance of the defensive type wounds that the victim sustained, (3) the possibility that the defendant's son, Michael Ames, inflicted some of the wounds sustained by the victim, (4) the precise location in Doran's where the defendant stabbed the victim, (5) whether the evidence indicated that the defendant intended to rob Doran's cash register, especially in light of testimony that suggested that\n   the defendant had her hand in or near the cash register's drawer, and (6) whether the defendant's attempt to steal a shot of tequila could serve as the predicate felony for felony murder.\n   <footnotemark>\n    11\n   </footnotemark>\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-74\">\n   The court also interrupted counsel, particularly defense counsel, to ask other clarifying questions. After defense counsel stated that \"the issue here is not whether or not [the defendant] caused the death but, rather, what were the circumstances, what [was] her mental state,\" the court asked, \"just to make it very clear, there's no question as to identity or causation[?]\" Moreover, the court interrupted defense counsel at one point to clarify whether defense counsel was referring to Michael Ames or the defendant, and, at another point, it asked defense counsel to clarify the location in the bar to which she was referring. Last, when defense counsel stated that she was \"not going to discuss the several alternative theories of how [she thought] that [the court's decision] should come out on the murder charge,\" the court asked defense counsel to clarify what alternative theories the defense was presenting: \"If, hypothetically, we find no intent, hypothetically. ... It seems to me that you wish us to consider a lesser included offense. The appropriate lesser included offense if, hypothetically, we find no intent, would be [reckless manslaughter]. ... Do you agree?\" The court also asked if the defendant was seeking a \"straight not guilty [finding],\" if \"the self-defense claim is only claimed if we find intent,\" and, \"[i]f we hypothetically, and I mean hypothetically, do not find intent, then we don't consider self-defense ... we go to reckless.\"\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-75\">\n   On appeal, the defendant claims that the foregoing interruptions by the court denied defense counsel the ability to present closing argument as she saw fit and,\n   therefore, deprived the defendant of her right to the assistance of counsel. We disagree.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-76\">\n   Although the defendant did not preserve this claim properly at trial by objecting to the court's interruptions and questions, she asks us to review the claim pursuant to\n   <em>\n    State\n   </em>\n   v.\n   <em>\n    Golding\n   </em>\n   ,\n   <extracted-citation case-ids=\"566558\" index=\"64\" url=\"https://cite.case.law/conn/213/233/#p239\">\n    213 Conn. 233\n   </extracted-citation>\n   , 239-40,\n   <extracted-citation index=\"65\" url=\"https://cite.case.law/citations/?q=567%20A.2d%20823\">\n    567 A.2d 823\n   </extracted-citation>\n   (1989) ; see\n   <em>\n    In re Yasiel R.\n   </em>\n   ,\n   <extracted-citation index=\"66\" url=\"https://cite.case.law/citations/?q=317%20Conn.%20773\">\n    317 Conn. 773\n   </extracted-citation>\n   , 781,\n   <extracted-citation index=\"67\" url=\"https://cite.case.law/citations/?q=120%20A.3d%201188\">\n    120 A.3d 1188\n   </extracted-citation>\n   (2015) (modifying third condition of\n   <em>\n    Golding\n   </em>\n   ).

Indeed, a review of defense counsel's closing argument reveals that, notwithstanding the court's interruptions, defense counsel was able to present robust argument regarding the evidence and theories of defense. In particular, defense counsel used the majority of her time during closing argument to challenge the felony murder and attempt to commit robbery charges. As indicated by the court's acquittal on those charges, defense counsel was successful in demonstrating that the state did not carry its burden of proof on those charges. Defense counsel also was able to present argument that the evidence presented at trial failed to show that the defendant intended to cause the victim's death. Furthermore, defense counsel later discussed the defendant's \"mental state\" and how Lewis' testimony, evidence of the defendant's intoxication, and other physical and testimonial evidence tended to support\n   her claim of self-defense and the affirmative defense of extreme emotional disturbance.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-83\">\n   Additionally, the defendant has not demonstrated that the court's particular questions and interruptions were so prejudicial that they deprived her of a fair trial. First, some of the court's questions were asked for purposes of clarifying defense counsel's argument. For instance, although defense counsel stated that she would not \"discuss the alternative theories\" presented by the defense, the court, presumably to prevent confusion, was able to elicit the defendant's position with respect to lesser included offenses, intent, and affirmative defenses. Second, the court asked the same questions of\n   <em>\n    both\n   </em>\n   parties, and when it asked the state a question that it had not asked defense counsel, defense counsel was given a chance to respond after the completion of closing arguments.\n   <footnotemark>\n    12\n   </footnotemark>\n   Third, although it initially had denied defense counsel's request for additional time, the court later granted defense counsel an additional five minutes for argument. Fourth, the court expressly rejected the defendant's contention that the questions were a form of \"premature deliberation.\" As previously indicated, the court was careful to indicate that its questions were \"hypothetical\" in nature and that it was not yet making any actual findings.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-84\">\n   Ultimately, the defendant's claim that the court's questions and interruptions were prejudicial is unpersuasive. Indeed, rather than view the court's conduct as prejudicial to the defendant, many advocates would\n   view the court's questions as a welcome opportunity to learn and then address the fact finder's specific concerns with any weaknesses and flaws in their arguments. In the present case, this is precisely what the court's questions permitted defense counsel to do. Moreover, as previously discussed, such questions did not in any way preclude defense counsel\n   from arguing the defendant's theories of defense.

We focus on the throat-grabbing because the defendant appears to emphasize that occurrence as support for her contention that her stress disorder was triggered and, therefore, that she necessarily acted under the influence of an extreme emotional disturbance. The court, however, could have found both that the victim grabbed the defendant\n    <em>\n     and\n    </em>\n    that the defendant's reaction to the grabbing was not done under the influence of an extreme emotional disturbance. The court still was not required to credit any of the other evidence that the defendant proffered in support of her contention that she acted under the influence of an extreme emotional disturbance, whether it was her own testimony or that of her expert witness. In other words, on the basis of all of the evidence presented, the court properly determined that the defendant had not met her burden of establishing her defense by a preponderance of the evidence. Indeed, as noted in part I of this opinion, the evidence clearly supported the court's conclusion that the stabbing simply was a reaction to \"a barroom brawl [that] [she] herself had initiated,\" rather than a reaction that occurred under the influence of an extreme emotional disturbance.\n   </p>\n  </footnote>\n  <footnote label=\"8\">\n   <p id=\"p-100\">\n    A state medical examiner testified that the victim sustained slicing injuries to his right hand, left hand, and left wrist, as well as bruises and scraping to his forehead, arms, lips, neck, legs, and penis.\n   </p>\n  </footnote>\n  <footnote label=\"9\">\n   <p id=\"p-101\">\n    Because the defendant has invoked only the protections of the federal constitution, we decline to analyze the defendant's claim under our state constitution. \"We have repeatedly apprised litigants that we will not entertain a state constitutional claim unless the defendant has provided an independent analysis under the particular provisions of the state constitution at issue.\" (Internal quotation marks omitted.)\n    <em>\n     State\n    </em>\n    v.\n    <em>\n     Johnson\n    </em>\n    ,\n    <extracted-citation case-ids=\"6768177\" index=\"121\" url=\"https://cite.case.law/conn-app/140/479/\">\n     140 Conn.App. 479\n    </extracted-citation>\n    , 481 n.2,\n    <extracted-citation index=\"122\" url=\"https://cite.case.law/citations/?q=59%20A.3d%20366\">\n     59 A.3d 366\n    </extracted-citation>\n    , cert. denied,\n    <extracted-citation index=\"123\" url=\"https://cite.case.law/citations/?q=308%20Conn.%20917\">\n     308 Conn. 917\n    </extracted-citation>\n    ,\n    <extracted-citation index=\"124\" url=\"https://cite.case.law/citations/?q=62%20A.3d%20527\">\n     62 A.3d 527\n    </extracted-citation>\n    (2013).\n   </p>\n  </footnote>\n  <footnote label=\"10\">\n   <p id=\"p-102\">\n    The court stated the following to defense counsel: \"Suppose, hypothetically, I accept your explanation that ... the pool cue ... was broken by one of the-the male participants, and that supports your general argument that there was some sort of violent struggle in the poolroom.
