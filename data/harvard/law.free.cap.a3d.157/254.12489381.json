Yuan, M.D. (\"Dr. Yuan\"), challenges the Court of Special Appeals' conclusion that there was no clear public policy mandate to support a claim for wrongful termination for reporting research misconduct in a federally funded project at Respondent institution Johns Hopkins University School of Medicine (\"JHU\"), a scientific research institution. Dr. Yuan was a researcher employed by JHU. The suit arises from Dr. Yuan's allegation that he was wrongfully terminated in retaliation for his repeated protests\n   of research misconduct in violation of 42 U.S.C. \u00a7 289b and 42 C.F.R. Part 93.\n   <footnotemark>\n    1\n   </footnotemark>\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-10\">\n   We hold that these provisions regarding research misconduct do not provide a clear public policy to support a tort claim for wrongful termination of employment. The self-regulating provisions direct the federally funded scientific institutions to provide procedures to investigate allegations of research misconduct, take appropriate action, and address retaliation.\n   <em>\n    See\n   </em>\n   <extracted-citation index=\"0\" url=\"https://cite.case.law/citations/?q=42%20C.F.R.%20%C2%A7%C2%A7%2093.300\">\n    42 C.F.R. \u00a7\u00a7 93.300\n   </extracted-citation>\n   -93.304. The scientific institution, not this Court, is in the best position and has the expertise to determine whether the research results of its employees amounted to impermissible research misconduct or permissible error or differences of opinion. Dr. Yuan did not follow the protocol outlined in JHU's policies for research misconduct claims. Further, Dr. Yuan acknowledged in his brief filed in this case that the regulations do not provide him with legal redress in the form of damages and he therefore seeks tort damages based on a theory of wrongful termination. However, there was no clear violation of the research misconduct regulations to warrant a cause of action for wrongful termination.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-11\">\n   Dr. Yuan also alleged conversion because after the termination of his employment, he was denied access to stored research materials he had collected. However, JHU owned the research materials pursuant to its policy, and it is well settled that a party may not convert that which it owns. Therefore, we affirm the judgment of the Court of Special Appeals.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-12\">\n   <strong>\n    FACTUAL AND PROCEDURAL BACKGROUND\n   </strong>\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-13\">\n   Dr. Yuan alleged in a lengthy amended complaint the following facts:\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-14\">\n   Dr. Yuan was Board-certified in General Pediatrics and Pediatric Gastroenterology. He was employed by JHU as a researcher\n   with the Pediatrics Faculty. In July 2001, he joined the lab of Dr. Jef Boeke (\"Dr. Boeke\"), a Professor in the Department of Molecular Biology and Genetics and the head of a yeast genetics lab. The lab was largely funded through the National Institute of Health (\"NIH\"), an agency of the United States Department of Health and Human Services (\"DHHS\"). Between February 2002 and June 2011, the NIH provided over $11.8 million to the lab for research on the Synthetic Lethality Analyzed by Microarray (\"SLAM\") project, which was an ambitious yeast genetics research project using a novel methodology, as well as a $34 million grant for a project related to the SLAM research. In Dr. Boeke's lab, Dr. Yuan was initially responsible for developing the computational infrastructure to manage the SLAM project's massive datasets.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-15\">\n   When SLAM entered its Production phase, in 2004, Dr. Yuan discovered and reported to the Production team a concern that contaminating traces of DNA from preceding SLAM experiments had led to false positive results. However, the team resisted his concerns and suggestions for addressing the issue and instead began withholding data files from him.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-16\">\n   Dr. Yuan stated that from 2005 through 2011, he repeatedly reported research misconduct concerning the yeast genetics research claiming that the SLAM researchers were falsifying the results. In particular, on November 28, 2005, Dr. Yuan\n   emailed Dr. Boeke about issues he identified in research completed by Xuewen Pan (\"Dr. Pan\"), a postdoctoral fellow in Dr. Boeke's lab. Dr. Yuan stated that Dr. Pan's \"genes are preselected,\" and that continuing with those research projects \"will only generate more useless data.\" He also stated that the SLAM team had already established that \"most of the [SLAM Project] hits being identified are bogus.\"\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-17\">\n   Dr. Pan's research was published in a biomedical journal,\n   <em>\n    Cell\n   </em>\n   , with Dr. Boeke as the senior author in early 2006. Moreover, Dr. Boeke cited Dr. Pan's research when he applied for grant renewals through the NIH. After the NIH renewed the SLAM project funding in late 2006, Dr. Boeke issued a new organizational chart which had the effect of excluding Dr. Yuan from extensive involvement with the SLAM research. Dr. Yuan maintained that he protested his lack of a definite professional role in the SLAM Project and found himself increasingly marginalized and excluded from the data management.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-18\">\n   Between 2006 and 2008, the SLAM research was unsuccessful; the lab did not have significant results to report to NIH. Dr. Boeke asked other researchers to review the SLAM project data, excluding Dr. Yuan. The researchers corroborated Dr. Yuan's findings and found that the data had an extraordinarily high \"False Discovery Rate.\" In the summer of 2008, Dr. Boeke decided not to renew the NIH grant for SLAM, although, some funding remained available to operate SLAM.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-19\">\n   In January 2009, after analyzing Dr. Pan's microarray data from his\n   <em>\n    Cell\n   </em>\n   publication, Dr. Yuan determined that Dr. Pan could not have obtained the results he claimed. His conclusion was not that Dr. Pan fabricated the results; instead, Dr. Yuan asserted that Dr. Pan likely conducted the experiment with preconceptions of the results he wanted to find-and then managed to find those results. Dr. Yuan also concluded similarly with respect to a paper published in 2008 by Dr. Yu-yi Lin (\"Dr. Lin\") in\n   <em>\n    Genes &amp; Development\n   </em>\n   . In January of 2009, Dr. Yuan also notified both Dr. Boeke and SLAM's project\n   manager, Dr. Meluh, of the problems with Dr. Pan's 2006 and Dr. Lin's 2008 papers.\n   Dr. Yuan was informed by Dr. Boeke in December 2009 that Dr. Boeke would not be renewing his faculty contract for 2011, unless he was able to secure self-sustaining funding within the next year. Dr. Boeke explained this was due to limited funding; however, at that time, Dr. Boeke established three new full-time positions with the SLAM Project for three other individuals.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-20\">\n   Dr. Yuan again reported problems with SLAM research, in January 2010, at a lab seminar where he identified bizarre zigzag patterns after plotting data for individual genes in SLAM's Production data in chronological order. Dr. Yuan concluded that these zigzags were both non-random and unpredictable and were also large enough to masquerade as the genetic interactions that SLAM was looking for; thus, according to Dr. Yuan, attempts to interpret SLAM's data were doomed to fail. Further, during the last week of the NIH funding of SLAM, on June 29, 2010, Dr. Yuan wrote to Dr. Boeke that after analyzing the production team's last 118 experiments, he found about ten percent had \"noise\" (bad data) with no apparent cause and only about ten percent \"looked pretty good.\"\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-21\">\n   In October 2010, two of the grant applications Dr. Yuan sought funding for had failed. Dr. Yuan asserted that Dr. Boeke falsely conveyed to him that there was no available funding to support him. On December 14, 2010, Dr. Carol Greider (\"Dr. Greider\"), the director of the Department of Molecular Biology and Genetics, offered Dr. Yuan a part-time support staff position for the 2011 year to expire at the end of that year. The salary was $24,800, well below his salary as a researcher. Dr. Yuan accepted the employment contract; however, from January 2011 forward, Dr. Boeke excluded Dr. Yuan from lab activities.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-22\">\n   On April 29, 2011, Dr. Lin held a seminar in Dr. Boeke's lab. Dr. Yuan alleged that the data results were inaccurate because when he asked Dr. Lin several questions regarding the\n   research neither Dr. Lin nor Dr. Boeke could provide adequate responses.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-23\">\n   Further issues arose when on June 29, 2011, Dr. Yuan submitted a publication and listed himself as the sole author. Dr. Boeke asked Dr. Greider to issue a written reprimand to Dr. Yuan for failing to offer Dr. Boeke shared authorship of the published manuscript. Dr. Greider issued a reprimand to Dr. Yuan. This led to Dr. Yuan meeting with Joan Johnson, a human resources representative for JHU School of Medicine, on July 8, 2011, to discuss Dr. Yuan's concerns about Dr. Greider's reprimand. Dr. Yuan also initiated JHU's Grievance Appeals Process. He explained that his employment problems arose over the context of results produced in the lab, and that there was an inexplicable vehemence that Dr. Boeke and Dr. Greider exhibited towards him. JHU denied Dr. Yuan's grievance appeal on December 22, 2011.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-24\">\n   Dr. Yuan's employment contract was set to end on December 31, 2011. Prior to his end date, he requested a property pass from Dr. Boeke, which would allow him to move his research collection of archived cells out of the lab. Dr. Boeke refused to provide him the pass until they could come to an understanding of all the issues relating to which files and materials Dr. Yuan could take.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-25\">\n   On November 30, 2011, Dr. Yuan requested an affidavit or other confirmation that Dr. Boeke would give Dr. Yuan access to Dr. Yuan's archived cells for five years. According to Dr. Yuan, Dr. Boeke initially accepted this request, but later failed to mention the matter in any correspondence between Dr. Yuan, Dr. Boeke, and JHU.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-26\">\n   Later, JHU declined to provide such access. On December 15, Dr. Yuan went to JHU to seek access to his materials and was escorted from the workplace by JHU Security Officers.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-27\">\n   After Dr. Yuan's employment contract with JHU had expired, in early 2012, a \"Letter\" (equivalent to a research paper) was published in a scientific research journal,\n   <em>\n    Nature\n   </em>\n   , with Dr. Lin and Dr. Boeke named as the authors. After reviewing the publication, Dr. Yuan believed there were serious\n   conceptual errors in the paper. He concluded that the underlying data was not reproducible. Dr. Yuan's counsel, on May 14, 2012, told Ronald J. Daniels, the president of JHU, and Edward D. Miller, the president of the School of Medicine, about these \"serious scientific problems\" in the publication. Patricia L. McClean, JHU senior associate general counsel, responded on May 21, 2012 stating that, \"[t]he School of Medicine is looking into the allegations of research misconduct made in your letter under its Procedures for Dealing with Issues of Research Misconduct.\" No one from JHU, however, sought further information from Dr. Yuan nor contacted him regarding the\n   <em>\n    Nature\n   </em>\n   paper.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-28\">\n   On July 24, 2012, Dr. Yuan submitted a \"rebuttal analysis\" to Dr. Lin and Dr. Boeke about the\n   <em>\n    Nature\n   </em>\n   article for submission to\n   <em>\n    Nature\n   </em>\n   . Dr. Yuan requested that both Dr. Lin and Dr. Boeke respond. A response was due on August 7, 2012. Neither doctor responded. On August 8, 2012, someone emailed Dr. Yuan, using Dr. Lin's account stating, \"Dr. Yuan, Yu-yi [Dr. Lin] passed away this morning. Now you must be very satisfied with your success. Congratulations[.]\" The death appeared to be a suicide as news accounts in Taiwanese media made clear that Dr. Lin had died in his lab from a self-administered overdose of sedatives. Moreover, the media reported he had attempted to jump off a building the previous evening. His wife stated that Dr. Lin was concerned about a \"conduct-of-research\" case and had trouble sleeping from the pressure.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-29\">\n   Dr. Yuan received an email from Dr. Boeke on February 11, 2013, asking if he would sign a \"correction\" that was prepared for the 2006\n   <em>\n    Cell\n   </em>\n   paper. \"The gist of the correction was that the fraction of genetic interactions that could be traced back to the paper's SLAM-based microarray data was 75[%], not 90[%] as originally stated.\" Dr. Yuan responded to Dr. Boeke that he would not sign a correction, but Dr. Boeke still submitted them to\n   <em>\n    Cell\n   </em>\n   , which published it as an \"Erratum\" on May 23, 2013. On November 6, 2013, the\n   <em>\n    Nature\n   </em>\n   paper was also retracted. There was no \"correction.\" Dr. Boeke admitted that \"the Methods section in our Letter is inaccurate, and that\n   for 38% of the interactions found by the primary screen there was discordance in sign,\" which was consistent with Dr. Yuan's findings. Dr. Yuan implies that this acknowledgment of incorrect data indicates that research misconduct occurred.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-30\">\n   On December 13, 2013, Dr. Yuan filed, in the Circuit Court for Baltimore City, a complaint for damages against JHU. He alleged wrongful termination in violation of public policy. Dr. Yuan based this wrongful discharge action on\n   <extracted-citation index=\"1\" url=\"https://cite.case.law/citations/?q=42%20C.F.R.%20%C2%A7%C2%A7%2093.100\">\n    42 C.F.R. \u00a7\u00a7 93.100\n   </extracted-citation>\n   -93.104, which provides that DHHS, including NIH, must investigate and punish intentional, knowing, or reckless \"research misconduct\" that represents \"a significant departure from accepted practices of the relevant research community.\" The regulations direct the federally funded institutions to provide procedures to investigate misconduct, take appropriate action, and address retaliation.\n   <em>\n    See\n   </em>\n   <extracted-citation index=\"2\" url=\"https://cite.case.law/citations/?q=42%20C.F.R.%20%C2%A7%C2%A7%2093.300\">\n    42 C.F.R. \u00a7\u00a7 93.300\n   </extracted-citation>\n   -93.304. \"Research misconduct means fabrication, falsification, or plagiarism in proposing, performing, or reviewing\n   research, or in reporting research results.\"\n   <extracted-citation index=\"3\" url=\"https://cite.case.law/citations/?q=42%20C.F.R.%20%C2%A7%2093.103\">\n    42 C.F.R. \u00a7 93.103\n   </extracted-citation>\n   . Dr. Yuan also brought claims for conversion and tortious interference with prospective economic advantage. JHU filed a motion to dismiss or, in the alternative, for summary judgment and a request for a hearing. On May 12, 2014, the Circuit Court held a hearing and granted JHU's motion to dismiss because Dr. Yuan failed to identify a public policy exception to the at-will employment doctrine. Judge Lawrence Fletcher-Hill, for the Circuit Court, explained:\n  </p>\n  <blockquote id=\"p-31\">\n   There certainly are ample allegations that Dr. Yuan raised and continued to raise issues within his lab with Dr. Boeke and with others about the conclusion being reached by the research, [and] the manner in which the research was conducted. But the allegations very carefully skirt the line of fraud, falsification of data or manipulation of data. And it is a good illustration of why this tort needs to be drawn narrowly [so] that it does not amount to the opportunity for courts to litigate debates, intellectual debates within the scientific community about methodology or research methods or conclusions. Based on the allegations, even giving them full credit, until after Dr. Yuan was fired, his objections\n   amounted to those types of intellectual debates and challenges within the lab.... \"[W]hile there's not [sic] question that academic integrity and research integrity is an important value, I conclude that it does not rise to the level that the Court of Appeals would recognize as the clear public policy necessary to support [a] cause of action for the tort of wrongful discharge in Maryland.\n  </blockquote>\n  <p id=\"p-32\">\n   The Circuit Court also rejected the conversion claim:\n  </p>\n  <blockquote id=\"p-33\">\n   [A]lthough it may be that there is a policy at Johns Hopkins University to on a case-by-case basis allow research material or research data to be released for the individual or non-Hopkins use by researchers who have developed it at Hopkins, the basic policy, which is clearly stated and has not been challenged here, is that Hopkins asserts its ownership of all research material and all research data that has been developed within labs of the University.... Hopkins could not have converted what it in fact had ownership of.\n  </blockquote>\n  <p id=\"p-34\">\n   Dr. Yuan filed a timely notice of appeal from the judgment of the Circuit Court. The Court of Special Appeals affirmed.\n   <em>\n    Yuan v.

The intermediate appellate court concluded:\n  </p>\n  <blockquote id=\"p-35\">\n   [T]hat the broad language and complex nature of these federal provisions, their deference to institutions, such as Hopkins, for the prevention and detection of research misconduct, and the difficult line they draw between scientific errors and wrongdoing and between falsity and fraud, make this a poor State public policy vehicle to carry a wrongful discharge action.

We hold that the provisions regarding research misconduct do not provide a clear public policy to support a tort claim for wrongful termination of employment. The self-regulating provisions direct the federally funded scientific institutions to provide procedures to investigate allegations of research misconduct, take appropriate action, and address retaliation. Dr. Yuan did not follow the protocols outlined in JHU's policies for such claims. Although Dr. Yuan is correct that the federal regulations do not provide him a legal remedy and damages because the public policy he is alleging is not clearly discernible, there is no basis to support a claim for wrongful termination and tort damages. Dr. Yuan was not wrongfully terminated and his at-will employment came to an end due to the expiration of his employment contract. Moreover, Dr. Yuan's allegation of conversion must fail because JHU owned the research materials pursuant to its stated policies. Accordingly, JHU, as a matter of law, cannot convert property that it already owns.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-41\">\n   <strong>\n    STANDARD OF REVIEW\n   </strong>\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-42\">\n   In reviewing a motion to dismiss this Court has stated:\n  </p>\n  <blockquote id=\"p-43\">\n   On appeal from a dismissal for failure to state a claim, we must assume the truth of, and view in a light most favorable to the non-moving party, all well-pleaded facts and allegations contained in the complaint, as well as all inferences\n   that may reasonably be drawn from them, and order dismissal only if the allegations and permissible inferences, if true, would not afford relief to the plaintiff,\n   <em>\n    i.e.\n   </em>\n   , the allegations do not state a cause of action for which relief may be granted.

Part 93, that prohibit research misconduct as sources of public policy. Further, according to Dr. Yuan, the intermediate appellate court erred in upholding the Circuit Court's dismissal of his conversion claim. Dr. Yuan states either (a) JHU's policy expressly recognizes his entitlement to possession of the research cell lines he created, or, in the alternative, (b) JHU's policy is ambiguous on Dr. Yuan's\n   entitlement to those cell lines and further discovery is thus necessary.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-49\">\n   JHU, however, contends Dr. Yuan's claim for wrongful termination fails because the regulations related to research misconduct are too vague and variable to give rise to a clear public policy of Maryland supporting a claim for wrongful termination under the circumstances. According to JHU, sound public policy should promote debate among researchers, protecting this process from the specter of jury adjudication and damages, rather than impose a wrongful discharge penalty for unfettered discussion.

L.J. SCI. &amp; TECH. at 79. O'Leary observes that the problem with resolving research misconduct allegations through the judiciary, \"whether through civil litigation or criminal prosecutions, is that determinations of misconduct in this area frequently require a sophisticated understanding of\n   scientific methods and principles that courts and juries rarely possess and are often badly positioned to obtain, even with assistance from expert witnesses.\" 25 ALB. L.J. SCI. &amp; TECH. at 71. Thus, we cannot say that the public policy allegedly violated by JHU is sufficiently clear to provide the basis for Dr. Yuan's wrongful discharge claim and JHU appears to be in a much better position to address research misconduct, consistent with its internal policies.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-81\">\n   In fact, JHU had such procedures in place as reflected in its \"Procedures for Dealing with Issues of Research Misconduct\" document.\n   <em>\n    See\n   </em>\n   <extracted-citation index=\"68\" url=\"https://cite.case.law/citations/?q=42%20C.F.R.%20%C2%A7%C2%A7%2093.300\">\n    42 C.F.R. \u00a7 93.300\n   </extracted-citation>\n   (d)\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-82\">\n   and JHU Research Misconduct Procedures at Section II. JHU's Procedures for Dealing with Issues of Research Misconduct provide that an employee who \"suspects that research misconduct has occurred has an obligation to report that suspicion to the director of the department or division affected, or to the Dean of the School of Medicine.\" Dr. Yuan did not report that he believed he was fired in retaliation for reporting alleged research misconduct according to the procedures in place. He directed his complaints about the SLAM data and experiments to other researchers in the lab in which he and Dr. Boeke worked. Dr. Boeke, a professor in the Department of Molecular Biology and Genetics and the head of a yeast genetics lab, and the other researchers were the same individuals who Dr. Yuan accused of the misconduct and did not fall into the category of the Dean of the School of Medicine or directors of the department affected. Furthermore, Dr. Greider was the director of the Department of Molecular Biology and Genetics. Dr. Yuan, however, does not state in his complaint that he reported allegations of research misconduct to her. Moreover, wrongful discharge requires termination by the employer. Here, Dr. Yuan's employment contract simply expired; he was not wrongfully terminated in violation of a clear and specific public policy.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-83\">\n   Furthermore, Congress has explicitly vested broad authority in the scientific institutions to determine how to address retaliation and whistleblowers. The Secretary of HHS even proposed regulations which would allow relief to whistleblowers\n   and would require a federally funded organization to deal with these retaliation claims by providing an administrative hearing where they could recover money damages. Public Health Service Standards for the Protection of Research Misconduct Whistleblowers,\n   <extracted-citation index=\"69\" url=\"https://cite.case.law/citations/?q=65%20Fed.%20Reg.%2070%2C830\">\n    65 Fed.

OFFICE OF THE PRESIDENT , RIN: 0937-AA03, PUBLIC HEALTH SERVICE STANDARDS FOR THE PROTECTION OF RESEARCH MISCONDUCT WHISTLEBLOWERS (2011). Thus, the federal research misconduct scheme does not create a legal remedy, granting employees damages, for retaliation for reporting research misconduct. Therefore, it would be inappropriate for this Court to step in and recognize a public policy against research misconduct in order to grant tort damages to complaining employees. In view of the research misconduct regulatory scheme, as O'Leary observes, the federal regulations show \"a long tradition of government deference to the norms and integrity of the academy,\" 25 ALB. L.J. SCI. &amp; TECH. at 90, and a \"deferential attitude favoring scientific self-regulation of research,\" 25 ALB. L.J. SCI. &amp; TECH. at 72. As the Court of Specials pointed out \"[a] broader remedy, such as damages, for research misconduct would invite judicial intrusion into the norms of the academy.

The Supreme Court of the United States stated long ago:\n  </p>\n  <blockquote id=\"p-107\">\n   If one is employed to devise or perfect an instrument, or a means for accomplishing a prescribed result, he cannot, after successfully accomplishing the work for which he was employed, plead title thereto as against his employer. That which he has been employed and paid to accomplish becomes, when accomplished, the property of his employer.\n  </blockquote>\n  <p id=\"p-108\">\n   <em>\n    Solomons v.

Dr. Yuan's employment involved molecular\n   biology and genetics research for JHU. Further, we have found no law, nor did Dr. Yuan offer any law, to support the proposition that Dr. Yuan was entitled to continue his possession of research materials when his employment ended.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-109\">\n   Under the JHU Policy, there is no absolute right of a discharged or former researcher to have access or ownership of the research materials. Rather, JHU maintains ownership, \"unless specific terms of sponsorship, other agreements, or University policy supersede\" JHU's rights. Notably, Dr. Yuan's complaint seems to indicate that all research data and materials were created during Dr. Yuan's tenure at JHU; thus, their ownership is determined by JHU policy, which provides that research data may remain with JHU. Clearly, one cannot covert property which one owns.\n   <em>\n    Borzym\n   </em>\n   ,\n   <extracted-citation case-ids=\"16442\" index=\"109\" url=\"https://cite.case.law/md/379/249/#p261\">\n    379 Md. at 261-63\n   </extracted-citation>\n   ,\n   <extracted-citation case-ids=\"16442\" index=\"110\" url=\"https://cite.case.law/md/379/249/#p261\">\n    841 A.2d at 835-36\n   </extracted-citation>\n   (discussing case law that defines \"conversion\" to mean taking another's property);\n   <em>\n    Interstate Ins.
