To effectuate the repeal of the death penalty and provisions related to the death penalty, the General Assembly repealed several statutes, and repealed and reenacted, with amendments, other statutes, including Md. Code Ann., Crim. Law (2002, 2012 Repl. Vol.) (\"CR (2012)\") \u00a7 2-304(a), which previously governed the procedure for sentencing a defendant who was convicted of first-degree murder to life imprisonment or life imprisonment without the possibility of parole, where either the State did not give notice of intent to seek the death penalty, or the State gave such\n   notice but the trial court or jury determined that the death penalty should not be imposed.\n   <em>\n    See\n   </em>\n   <extracted-citation index=\"0\" url=\"https://cite.case.law/citations/?q=2013%20Md.%20Laws%202298\">\n    2013 Md.

The General Assembly amended CR (2012) \u00a7 2-304(a), effective October 1, 2013, by making the following deletions:\n  </p>\n  <blockquote id=\"p-10\">\n   (a)\n   <em>\n    In general\n   </em>\n   .-\n   <s>\n    (1)\n   </s>\n   If the State gave notice under \u00a7 2-203(1) of this title,\n   <sup>\n    [\n   </sup>\n   <footnotemark>\n    1\n   </footnotemark>\n   <sup>\n    ]\n   </sup>\n   <s>\n    but did not give notice of intent to seek the death penalty under \u00a7 2-202(a)(1) of this title,\n   </s>\n   the court shall conduct a separate sentencing proceeding as soon as practicable after the defendant is found guilty of murder in the first degree to determine whether the defendant shall be sentenced to imprisonment for life without the possibility of parole or to imprisonment for life.\n  </blockquote>\n  <blockquote id=\"p-11\">\n   <s>\n    (2) If the State gave notice under both \u00a7\u00a7 2-202(a)(1) and 2-203(1) of this title, but the court or jury determines that the death sentence may not be imposed, that court or jury shall determine whether the defendant shall be sentenced to\n   </s>\n   <s>\n    imprisonment for life without the possibility of parole or to imprisonment for life.\n   </s>\n  </blockquote>\n  <p id=\"p-12\">\n   <extracted-citation index=\"1\" url=\"https://cite.case.law/citations/?q=2013%20Md.%20Laws%202317\">\n    2013 Md.

In the early morning of August 6, 2010, Bellard was taken to a police station to be interviewed as a witness. As law enforcement officers gathered evidence throughout the day,\n   they learned that Bellard was a drug dealer from Texas and that he had been mad at one of the victims; Bellard, thus, became a suspect. Bellard initially denied responsibility for the deaths of the four victims, but later confessed to the shootings.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-23\">\n   On February 4, 2011, the State filed a notice of intent to seek the death penalty. Prior to the start of Bellard's trial, in 2013, the General Assembly passed Senate Bill 276, repealing the death penalty, and on May 2, 2013, the Governor of Maryland approved Senate Bill 276.\n   <em>\n    See\n   </em>\n   <extracted-citation index=\"2\" url=\"https://cite.case.law/citations/?q=2013%20Md.%20Laws%202323\">\n    2013 Md. Laws 2323\n   </extracted-citation>\n   (Vol. III, Ch. 156, S.B. 276). The act was to take effect on October 1, 2013.\n   <em>\n    See\n    <extracted-citation index=\"3\" url=\"https://cite.case.law/citations/?q=2013%20Md.%20Laws%202323\">\n     id.\n    </extracted-citation>\n   </em>\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-24\">\n   On June 3, 2013, in response to the pending repeal of the death penalty, the State filed in the circuit court a \"Notice to Withdraw Intent to Seek Death Penalty.\" On June 6, 2013, the State filed a \"Notice of Intent to Seek Sentence of Imprisonment for Life without Possibility of Parole\" as to all four counts of first-degree murder.\n   <footnotemark>\n    2\n   </footnotemark>\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-25\">\n   On March 5, 2014, Bellard filed a \"Notice of Defendant's Election to be Tried by Jury and, if Convicted of First[-]Degree Murder, to be Sentenced by Jury.\" On March 31, 2014, Bellard filed a request for specific\n   <em>\n    voir dire\n   </em>\n   concerning life imprisonment without the possibility of parole-specifically,\n   <em>\n    voir dire\n   </em>\n   questions \"relating to ... prejudice, partiality, presupposition, and/or inability to follow the law with regard to the sentencing process.\" On April 4, 2014, Bellard filed a motion to strike the State's notice of intent to seek life imprisonment without the possibility of parole. In the motion to strike, Bellard contended that the amended version of CR\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-26\">\n   \u00a7 2-304 requires a jury to decide whether to impose a sentence of life imprisonment without the possibility of parole, while Maryland Rule 4-342 requires a trial court to determine a defendant's sentence. According to Bellard, given the conflict between CR \u00a7 2-304 and Maryland Rule 4-342, it would be \"impossible\" to sentence him to life imprisonment without the possibility of parole \"in a manner that complies with both the statute and the rule [.]\" Bellard also argued that a sentence of life imprisonment without the possibility of parole would violate his rights under the United States Constitution and the Maryland Declaration of Rights.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-27\">\n   On April 7, 2014, the State filed a motion to strike Bellard's notice of election to be sentenced by jury. In the motion to strike, the State contended that, in repealing the death penalty, the General Assembly did not intend to create a statutory right for a defendant to have a jury determine whether to impose a sentence of life imprisonment without the possibility of parole. According to the State, with the exception of the death penalty, a defendant has no right to be sentenced by a jury, and no statute confers such a right to a defendant, despite whatever language the General Assembly left in CR \u00a7 2-304. The State further argued that the Maryland Rules clearly provide that a trial court shall determine whether to impose a sentence of life imprisonment without the possibility of parole.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-28\">\n   On April 7, 2014, the circuit court conducted a hearing, at which it heard argument on the motions to strike. At the hearing, the parties made the same arguments that they raised in the motions to strike, with Bellard's counsel contending, among other things, that amended CR \u00a7 2-304 provides for the right for a defendant to have a jury determine whether to impose life imprisonment without the possibility of parole. And, the State argued that the General Assembly's intent, as reflected by the plain language of CR \u00a7 2-304 and the legislative history of the bill repealing the death penalty, was solely to repeal the death penalty, not to create a new right to jury sentencing in cases in which the State seeks life imprisonment without the possibility of parole. At the conclusion of the\n   hearing, the circuit court orally ruled from the bench, denying Bellard's motion to strike the State's notice and striking, or denying, Bellard's notice of election to be sentenced by a jury.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-29\">\n   The case proceeded to trial, and a jury convicted Bellard of four counts of first-degree murder, four counts of use of a handgun in the commission of a felony or crime of violence, and three counts of conspiracy to commit murder. On June 27, 2014, the circuit court sentenced Bellard, in relevant part, to four consecutive sentences of life imprisonment without the possibility of parole, one for each conviction for first-degree murder.\n   <footnotemark>\n    3\n   </footnotemark>\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-30\">\n   On July 1, 2014, Bellard filed a request for a sentence review by a three-judge panel. On July 15, 2014, the circuit court issued an order directing a three-judge panel to consider Bellard's request. On September 2, 2014, on behalf of the three-judge panel, a judge of the panel issued an order denying the request without a hearing.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-31\">\n   In the meantime, on July 9, 2014, Bellard noted an appeal. On August 31, 2016, in a reported opinion, the Court of Special Appeals vacated two of the three convictions and sentences for conspiracy to commit murder, and affirmed the circuit court's judgments in all other respects.\n   <em>\n    See Bellard v.

Bellard argues that CR \u00a7 2-304 is unambiguous, and that CR \u00a7 2-304(b) plainly provides that a jury may sentence a defendant who has been convicted of first-degree murder to either life\n   imprisonment or life imprisonment without the possibility of parole, and that, with respect to a sentence of life imprisonment without the possibility of parole,\n   the jury's decision must be unanimous. Bellard asserts that his interpretation of CR \u00a7 2-304 is supported by Md. Code Ann., Corr. Servs. (1999, 2008 Repl. Vol., 2016 Supp.) (\"CS\") \u00a7 6-112(c)(3), which provides that a trial court \"or jury\" shall consider a presentence investigation report at a sentencing proceeding under CR \u00a7 2-304 where the State seeks life imprisonment without the possibility of parole.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-37\">\n   Bellard maintains that his interpretation of CR \u00a7 2-304 is supported by the statute's legislative history, as, in 2015 and 2016, the General Assembly refrained from passing bills that would have repealed the provisions that allow a jury to sentence a defendant to life imprisonment without the possibility of parole. With respect to the bills introduced during the 2015 legislative session, Bellard contends that the bills' language demonstrates that the bills' sponsors believed that CR \u00a7 2-304 grants a defendant the right to have a jury determine the defendant's sentence for first-degree murder. Bellard argues that the General Assembly's decision to not repeal or amend CR \u00a7 2-304(b) demonstrates an intent to permit a defendant to have a jury determine whether to impose life imprisonment without the possibility of parole where the defendant is convicted of first-degree murder. Bellard also asserts that, assuming there is any ambiguity in CR \u00a7 2-304, because CR \u00a7 2-304 is a penal statute, any ambiguity CR \u00a7 2-304 must be construed in his favor under the rule of lenity.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-38\">\n   The State responds that the General Assembly's repeal of the death penalty did not affect the longstanding principle that, where the State seeks life imprisonment without the possibility of parole, a trial court, not a jury, determines the sentence. The State contends that, because CR \u00a7 2-304(b) applied only where the State sought the death penalty, and because the General Assembly has repealed the death penalty, CR \u00a7 2-304(b) is now inoperative. The State argues that the General Assembly's only intent in amending CR (2012) \u00a7 2-304(a) was to repeal the death penalty, not to give new\n   meaning to CR \u00a7 2-304(b) and permit a defendant to have a jury determine whether to impose a sentence of life imprisonment without the possibility of parole. The State asserts that the plain language of CR \u00a7 2-304, as amended in 2013, demonstrates that the General Assembly did not intend to create a right to jury sentencing in cases in which the State seeks life imprisonment without the possibility of parole. The State maintains that CR \u00a7 2-304(a) has been interpreted to mean that a trial court, not a jury, determines whether to impose life imprisonment without the possibility of parole, and that the same language has been retained in the statute even after repeal of the death penalty.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-39\">\n   The State contends that, when read in context, the references to jury sentencing in CR \u00a7 2-304(b) do not create a new right, but are simply vestiges of the former death penalty sentencing scheme. The State argues that, even if CR \u00a7 2-304 is ambiguous, the legislative history supports the conclusion that the General Assembly did not intend to create a right to jury sentencing in cases in which the State seeks life imprisonment without the possibility of parole. As further support for its interpretation of CR \u00a7 2-304, the State points out that no right to jury sentencing has been enacted with respect to defendants convicted of other crimes for which a sentence of life imprisonment without the possibility of parole is an available penalty, such as first-degree rape and first-degree sexual offense. The State asserts that legislative inaction on subsequent bills introduced during the 2015 and 2016 legislative sessions is of no consequence, and is not\n   indicative of any intent by the General Assembly to create a right to jury sentencing in cases of life imprisonment without the possibility of parole through Senate Bill 276. The State maintains that the rule of lenity is inapplicable in this case because the rule of lenity applies only where a statute is open to more than one interpretation, and the court is unable to determine which interpretation the General Assembly intended.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-40\">\n   <strong>\n    Standard of Review\n   </strong>\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-41\">\n   \"An appellate court reviews without deference a trial court's interpretation of a statute[.]\"\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-42\">\n   <em>\n    Howard v.

We do so on the tacit theory that the General Assembly is presumed to have meant what it said and said what it meant. When the statutory language is clear, we need not look beyond the statutory language to determine the General Assembly's intent. If the words of the statute, construed according to their common and everyday meaning, are clear and unambiguous and express a plain meaning, we will give effect to the statute as it is written. In addition, we neither add nor delete words to a clear and unambiguous statute to give it a meaning not reflected by the words that the General Assembly used or engage in forced or subtle interpretation in an attempt to extend or limit the statute's meaning. If there is no ambiguity in the language, either inherently or by reference to other relevant laws or circumstances, the inquiry as to legislative intent ends.\n  </blockquote>\n  <blockquote id=\"p-45\">\n   If the language of the statute is ambiguous, however, then courts consider not only the literal or usual meaning of the words, but their meaning and effect in light of the setting, the objectives, and the purpose of the enactment under consideration. We have said that there is an ambiguity within a statute when there exist two or more reasonable alternative interpretations of the statute. When a statute can be interpreted in more than one way, the job of this Court is to resolve that ambiguity in light of the legislative intent, using all the resources and tools of statutory construction at our disposal.\n  </blockquote>\n  <blockquote id=\"p-46\">\n   If the true legislative intent cannot be readily determined from the statutory language alone, however, we may, and often must, resort to other recognized indicia-among other things, the structure of the statute, including its title; how the statute relates to other laws; the legislative history, including the derivation of the statute, comments and explanations regarding it by authoritative sources during the legislative process, and amendments proposed or added to it; the general purpose behind the statute; and the relative rationality and legal effect of various competing constructions.\n  </blockquote>\n  <blockquote id=\"p-47\">\n   In construing a statute, we avoid a construction of the statute that is unreasonable, illogical, or inconsistent with common sense.\n  </blockquote>\n  <blockquote id=\"p-48\">\n   In addition, the meaning of the plainest language is controlled by the context in\n   which i[t] appears. As this Court has stated, because it is part of the context, related statutes or a statutory scheme that fairly bears on the fundamental issue of legislative purpose or goal must also be considered. Thus, not only are we required to interpret the statute as a whole, but, if appropriate, in the context of the entire statutory scheme of which it is a part.\n  </blockquote>\n  <p id=\"p-49\">\n   <em>\n    Wagner v.

We reach this conclusion by applying the well-settled principles of statutory construction, and begin by examining CR \u00a7 2-304's language. On the one hand, CR \u00a7 2-304(a) provides that, if the State seeks life\n   imprisonment without the possibility of parole, \"the court shall conduct a separate sentencing proceeding ... to determine whether the defendant shall be sentenced to imprisonment for life without the possibility of parole or to imprisonment for life.\" On the other hand, CR \u00a7 2-304(b)(1) states that \"[a]\n   determination by a jury to impose a sentence of imprisonment for life without the possibility of parole must be unanimous[,]\" and CR \u00a7 2-304(b)(2) states: \"If the jury finds that a sentence of imprisonment for life without the possibility of parole shall be imposed, the court shall impose a sentence of imprisonment for life without the possibility of parole.\"\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-70\">\n   The conflict between CR \u00a7 2-304(a) and CR \u00a7 2-304(b) is evident-CR \u00a7 2-304(a) provides that a trial court shall conduct a sentencing proceeding to determine whether to sentence a defendant who is convicted of first-degree murder to life imprisonment without the possibility of parole, whereas CR \u00a7 2-304(b), although not a grant of authority for a jury to conduct a sentencing proceeding, appears to contemplate that a jury determine whether to sentence a defendant to life imprisonment without the possibility of parole. In short, CR \u00a7 2-304's language is ambiguous because \"there exist two or more reasonable alternative interpretations of the statute.\"\n   <em>\n    Wagner\n   </em>\n   ,\n   <extracted-citation case-ids=\"4365906\" index=\"42\" url=\"https://cite.case.law/md/445/404/#p417\">\n    445 Md. at 418\n   </extracted-citation>\n   ,\n   <extracted-citation case-ids=\"4365906,4365962\" index=\"43\" url=\"https://cite.case.law/a3d/128/1/\">\n    128 A.3d at 9\n   </extracted-citation>\n   (brackets and citation omitted). Indeed, Bellard and the State provide two such reasonable alternative interpretations of the CR \u00a7 2-304. Under Bellard's interpretation, pursuant to CR \u00a7 2-304(a) and (b), either a trial court or a jury decides whether to impose life imprisonment without the possibility of parole, depending on whether a defendant has elected to have a jury make such a determination. By contrast, under the State's interpretation, pursuant to CR \u00a7 2-304(a), only a trial court can decide whether to impose life imprisonment without the possibility of parole. These competing interpretations support the conclusion that CR \u00a7 2-304's language is ambiguous.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-71\">\n   We are unpersuaded by Bellard's contention that CR \u00a7 2-304's language is clear and unambiguous, and provides that a defendant who is convicted of first-degree murder may elect to have a jury determine whether to impose a sentence of life imprisonment without the possibility of parole. Similarly, we are unconvinced by the argument that CR \u00a7 2-304(a) and CR \u00a7 2-304(b) may be read to be consistent with one another, such that CR \u00a7 2-304(a) could be interpreted to mean that a\n   trial court would convene a sentencing proceeding and that, under CR \u00a7 2-304(b), the jury would make the determination as to the appropriate sentence. CR \u00a7 2-304(a)'s plain language states that a trial court shall conduct a separate sentencing proceeding to determine whether to impose a sentence of life imprisonment without the possibility of parole. And, when the General Assembly amended CR (2012) \u00a7 2-304, it eliminated CR (2012) \u00a7 2-304(a)(2), which expressly provided that the trial \"court or jury shall determine whether the defendant shall be sentenced to imprisonment for life without the possibility of parole or to imprisonment for life.\" The effect of eliminating CR (2012) \u00a7 2-304(a)(2) is that, under CR \u00a7 2-304(a), a trial court conducts the sentencing proceeding to make the determination as to life imprisonment without the possibility of parole. In other words, contrary to Bellard's contention, CR \u00a7 2-304(a) and CR \u00a7 2-304(b) are inconsistent, and an ambiguity exists in CR \u00a7 2-304's language as to whether the trial court or a jury determines whether to impose a sentence of life imprisonment without the possibility of parole where a defendant has been convicted of first-degree murder.\n   Because, read in its entirety, CR \u00a7 2-304's language is ambiguous, we must \"resolve that ambiguity in light of the legislative intent, using all the resources and tools of statutory construction at our disposal.\"\n   <em>\n    Wagner\n   </em>\n   ,\n   <extracted-citation case-ids=\"4365906\" index=\"44\" url=\"https://cite.case.law/md/445/404/#p417\">\n    445 Md. at 418\n   </extracted-citation>\n   ,\n   <extracted-citation case-ids=\"4365906,4365962\" index=\"45\" url=\"https://cite.case.law/a3d/128/1/\">\n    128 A.3d at 9\n   </extracted-citation>\n   (citation omitted). To determine the General Assembly's intent in amending CR (2012) \u00a7 2-304, we look to CR \u00a7 2-304's purpose, its legislative history, and relevant case law. A review of those resources of statutory construction demonstrate that, in repealing the death penalty and amending CR (2012) \u00a7 2-304(a), without amending CR (2012) \u00a7 2-304(b), the General Assembly did not intend to give a defendant who is convicted of first-degree murder the right to elect to have a jury determine whether to impose a sentence of life imprisonment without the possibility of parole.

Under CR (2012) \u00a7 2-304(a)(1), the jury was not involved in any determination with respect to life imprisonment without the possibility of parole where the State had filed only a notice of intent to seek life imprisonment without the possibility of parole and had not filed a notice of intent to seek the death penalty. Indeed, in\n   <em>\n    Woods\n   </em>\n   ,\n   <extracted-citation case-ids=\"2035480\" index=\"47\" url=\"https://cite.case.law/md/315/591/#p599\">\n    315 Md. at 599\n   </extracted-citation>\n   ,\n   <extracted-citation case-ids=\"2035480\" index=\"48\" url=\"https://cite.case.law/md/315/591/#p599\">\n    556 A.2d at 240\n   </extracted-citation>\n   , this Court had held as much, concluding that, where the State gives notice only of an intent to seek life imprisonment without the possibility of parole, \"the separate sentencing proceeding is before the court-a jury is not involved.\"\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-86\">\n   By contrast, under CR (2012) \u00a7 2-304(a)(2), if the State gave notice of an intent to seek both the death penalty and life imprisonment without the possibility of parole, but either the trial court or the jury determined that the death penalty should not be imposed, then either the trial court or the jury was required to determine whether to impose life imprisonment without the possibility of parole. In other words, under CR (2012) \u00a7 2-304(a)(2), it was only where the State sought both the death penalty and life imprisonment without the possibility of parole, where the defendant did not waive a jury sentencing proceeding,\n   <em>\n    see\n   </em>\n   CR (2012) \u00a7 2-303(c)(3) (providing that, where the State sought the death penalty, and where the defendant was convicted of first-degree murder, a sentencing proceeding was to be conducted before the trial court only if the defendant had waived a jury sentencing proceeding), and where a jury was unable to agree on the death penalty, that the jury would then be tasked with deciding whether to impose life imprisonment without the possibility of parole or life imprisonment. In such cases, under CR (2012) \u00a7 2-304(b)(1), the jury's determination to impose life imprisonment without the possibility of parole was to be unanimous; and, under CR (2012) \u00a7 2-304(b)(2), the\n   trial court was to impose life imprisonment without the possibility of parole where the jury was unanimous. However, under CR (2012) \u00a7 2-304(b)(3),\n   if the jury could not agree within a reasonable time to impose life imprisonment without the possibility of parole, then the trial court was to impose life imprisonment.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-87\">\n   In 2013, as explained above, through Senate Bill 276, the General Assembly repealed the death penalty and, among other things, amended CR (2012) \u00a7 2-304, by deleting references to the death penalty:\n  </p>\n  <blockquote id=\"p-88\">\n   (a)\n   <em>\n    In general.\n   </em>\n   -\n   <s>\n    (1)\n   </s>\n   If the State gave notice under \u00a7 2-203(1) of this title,\n   <s>\n    but did not give notice of intent to seek the death penalty under \u00a7 2-202(a)(1) of this title,\n   </s>\n   the court shall conduct a separate sentencing proceeding as soon as practicable after the defendant is found guilty of murder in the first degree to determine whether the defendant shall be sentenced to imprisonment for life without the possibility of parole or to imprisonment for life.\n  </blockquote>\n  <blockquote id=\"p-89\">\n   <s>\n    (2) If the State gave notice under both \u00a7\u00a7 2-202(a)(1) and 2-203(1) of this title, but the court or jury determines that the death sentence may not be imposed, that court or jury shall determine whether the defendant shall be sentenced to imprisonment for life without the possibility of parole or to imprisonment for life.\n   </s>\n  </blockquote>\n  <blockquote id=\"p-90\">\n   (b)\n   <em>\n    Findings.\n   </em>\n   -(1) A determination by a jury to impose a sentence of imprisonment for life without the possibility of parole must be unanimous.\n  </blockquote>\n  <blockquote id=\"p-91\">\n   (2) If the jury finds that a sentence of imprisonment for life without the possibility of parole shall be imposed, the court shall impose a sentence of imprisonment for life without the possibility of parole.\n  </blockquote>\n  <blockquote id=\"p-92\">\n   (3) If, within a reasonable time, the jury is unable to agree to imposition of a sentence of imprisonment for life without the possibility of parole, the court shall impose a sentence of imprisonment for life.\n  </blockquote>\n  <p id=\"p-93\">\n   <extracted-citation index=\"49\" url=\"https://cite.case.law/citations/?q=2013%20Md.%20Laws%202317\">\n    2013 Md.

Simply put, Senate Bill 276's sole purpose was to repeal the death penalty and enact necessary and related changes to effectuate the repeal of the death penalty. The General Assembly's intent to repeal the death penalty is demonstrated by the amendments that it enacted with respect to CR \u00a7 2-304: CR \u00a7 2-304(a) contained references to the death penalty, which the General Assembly deleted, whereas CR \u00a7 2-304(b) lacked references to the death penalty, and the General Assembly left CR \u00a7 2-304(b) intact. Nothing in Senate Bill 276's purpose clause or elsewhere evidences an intent\n   by the General Assembly, in repealing the death penalty, to create a right for a defendant who is convicted of first-degree murder to elect to have a jury determine whether to impose life imprisonment without the possibility of parole. Indeed, Senate Bill 276's purpose clause fails to show any intent whatsoever by the General Assembly to expand a jury's authority with respect to sentencing or to empower a jury to impose life imprisonment without the possibility of parole where a defendant is convicted of first-degree murder.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-97\">\n   Senate Bill 276's preamble explains that, in 2008, the General Assembly created the Maryland Commission on Capital Punishment \"for the purpose of studying all aspects of capital punishment as currently and historically administered in the State[,]\" and that the Commission's report included a \"strong recommendation that ... capital punishment be abolished in\n   Maryland[.]\"\n   <extracted-citation index=\"51\" url=\"https://cite.case.law/citations/?q=2013%20Md.%20Laws%202299\">\n    2013 Md. Laws 2299\n   </extracted-citation>\n   -2300 (Vol. III, Ch. 156, S.B. 276). Senate Bill 276's preamble reinforces the conclusion that Senate Bill 276's singular goal was to repeal the death penalty, not to change any aspect of sentencing a defendant who has been convicted of first-degree murder where the State has filed a notice of intent to seek life imprisonment without the possibility of parole. Senate Bill 276's purpose clause and preamble mention only the General Assembly's intent to repeal the death penalty, and neither the purpose clause nor the preamble references any other alteration to the then-existing sentencing proceedings for first-degree murder.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-98\">\n   Senate Bill 276's Revised Fiscal and Policy Note demonstrates that the General Assembly's sole purpose was to repeal the death penalty in Maryland, not to create a right for a defendant who is convicted of first-degree murder to elect to have a jury determine whether to impose life imprisonment without the possibility of parole. Senate Bill 276's Revised Fiscal and Policy Note states at the outset that the \"bill repeals the death penalty and all provisions relating to it, including those relating to its administration and post death sentencing proceedings.\" S.B. 276, 2013 Leg., Reg. Sess. (Md. 2013), Revised Fiscal and Policy Note, at 1, http://mgaleg.maryland.gov/2013RS/fnotes/bil_0006/sb0276.pdf [https://perma.cc/N3JF-A5UM]. Indeed, the entirety of the Revised Fiscal and Policy Note discusses the death penalty, including the fiscal effect of the repeal of the death penalty, the current law with respect to the death penalty, and a brief summary of prior introductions of bills that had sought to repeal the death penalty.\n   <em>\n    See id.\n   </em>\n   at 1-7.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-99\">\n   Senate Bill 276's Revised Fiscal and Policy Note does not demonstrate any intent on the General Assembly's behalf to create a right to jury sentencing for life imprisonment without the possibility of parole. Significantly, Senate Bill 276's Revised Fiscal and Policy Note mentions the word \"jury\" six times, and only in its discussions of \"Current Law\" and its summary of\n   <em>\n    Miles v. State\n   </em>\n   ,\n   <extracted-citation case-ids=\"3700150\" index=\"52\" url=\"https://cite.case.law/md/421/596/#p607\">\n    421 Md. 596\n   </extracted-citation>\n   , 607, 598,\n   <extracted-citation case-ids=\"3700651,3700150\" index=\"53\" url=\"https://cite.case.law/a3d/28/667/\">\n    28 A.3d 667\n   </extracted-citation>\n   , 673, 668 (2011), in which this Court held that the Sixth Amendment does not require a trial court to instruct a jury\n   that it cannot sentence a defendant to death unless every juror is persuaded beyond a reasonable doubt that the aggravating circumstances outweigh the mitigating circumstances.\n   <em>\n    See\n   </em>\n   S.B. 276, 2013 Leg., Reg. Sess. (Md. 2013), Revised Fiscal and Policy Note, at 2-3. Senate Bill 276's Revised Fiscal and Policy Note's section labeled \"Current Law\" contains, for example, the following statement: \"A court or jury, in considering the imposition of the death penalty, must first consider whether any of 10 aggravating circumstances exist beyond a reasonable doubt.\"\n   <em>\n    Id.\n   </em>\n   at 2. The word \"jury\" does not appear anywhere in Senate\n   Bill 276's Revised Fiscal and Policy Note's sections titled \"Fiscal Summary,\" \"Proposed Regulations,\" \"Status of the Death Penalty Nationally,\" \"The Office of the Public Defender,\" \"Department of Public Safety and Correctional Services,\" \"Judiciary and Office of the Attorney General,\" \"Additional Comments,\" and \"Additional Information.\"\n   <em>\n    See id.\n   </em>\n   at 1-2, 3-7.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-100\">\n   Importantly, in 1989-\n   <em>\n    i.e.\n   </em>\n   , more than two decades before the General Assembly repealed the death penalty in 2013-in\n   <em>\n    Woods\n   </em>\n   ,\n   <extracted-citation case-ids=\"2035480\" index=\"54\" url=\"https://cite.case.law/md/315/591/#p599\">\n    315 Md. at 599-600, 601\n   </extracted-citation>\n   ,\n   <extracted-citation case-ids=\"2035480\" index=\"55\" url=\"https://cite.case.law/md/315/591/#p599\">\n    556 A.2d at 239-40, 241\n   </extracted-citation>\n   , this Court held that, under CR (2012) \u00a7 2-304's predecessor, where the State did not seek the death penalty, and instead sought only life imprisonment without the possibility of parole, where a defendant was convicted of first-degree murder, a trial court, not a jury, decided whether to sentence a defendant to life imprisonment without the possibility of parole.\n   <em>\n    Woods\n   </em>\n   remained good law as of 2013, when the General Assembly repealed the death penalty. Thus, when the General Assembly amended CR (2012) \u00a7 2-304, the status quo was that a trial court was the only body empowered under CR (2012) \u00a7 2-304's predecessor and case law to impose life imprisonment without the possibility of parole. The General Assembly is presumed to be aware of this Court's interpretations of statutes.\n   <em>\n    See, e.g.\n   </em>\n   ,\n   <em>\n    Moore v.

Hence, we presume that, when the General Assembly amended CR (2012) \u00a7 2-304, the General Assembly was aware that, under\n   <em>\n    Woods\n   </em>\n   , a jury could not impose life imprisonment without the possibility of parole following a defendant's conviction of first-degree murder where the State sought only life imprisonment without the possibility of parole and not the death penalty.\n   <footnotemark>\n    6\n   </footnotemark>\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-101\">\n   Tellingly, the Revised Fiscal and Policy Note of Senate Bill 276-through which the General Assembly repealed the death penalty and, in pertinent part, amended CR (2012) \u00a7 2-304-does not mention an intent to abrogate or supersede\n   <em>\n    Woods\n   </em>\n   , either in its discussion of \"Current Law\" or any other section.\n   <em>\n    See\n   </em>\n   S.B. 276, 2013 Leg., Reg. Sess. (Md. 2013), Revised Fiscal and Policy Note. Nor does Senate Bill 276's Revised Fiscal and Policy Note mention any intent to alter the principle that, under existing law, only a trial court could impose life imprisonment without the possibility of parole where the State sought only life imprisonment without the possibility of parole, and where the defendant was convicted of first-degree murder.\n   <em>\n    See\n    <extracted-citation case-ids=\"5568106\" index=\"60\" url=\"https://cite.case.law/md/402/59/#p72\">\n     id.\n    </extracted-citation>\n   </em>\n   Senate Bill 276's Revised Fiscal and Policy Note's failure to reference, let alone discuss,\n   <em>\n    Woods\n   </em>\n   or its holding, or to discuss in any way a change in the manner in which life imprisonment without the possibility of parole is to be imposed, strongly\n   indicates that Senate Bill 276's purpose was simply to repeal the death penalty, and not to disturb the\n   existing sentencing procedures for a defendant who has been convicted of first-degree murder.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-102\">\n   As additional support for the determination that the General Assembly did not intend to create a right to have a jury decide whether to impose life imprisonment without the possibility of parole, we observe that nothing in Senate Bill 276 or elsewhere demonstrates that the General Assembly intended to create a right to sentencing by a jury for a defendant convicted of other crimes for which life imprisonment without the possibility of parole is an available penalty. For example, both first-degree rape and first-degree sexual offense are punishable by life imprisonment without the possibility of parole.\n   <em>\n    See\n   </em>\n   CR \u00a7 3-303(d) (setting forth the circumstances under which a defendant who is convicted of first-degree rape may be subject to life imprisonment without the possibility of parole); CR \u00a7 3-305(d) (setting forth the circumstances under which a defendant who is convicted of first-degree sexual offense may be subject to life imprisonment without the possibility of parole). Logic dictates that, if the General Assembly intended to create a right for a defendant to elect to have a jury determine whether to impose life imprisonment without the possibility of parole, it would have extended that right not only to defendants convicted of first-degree murder, but also to similarly situated defendants convicted of other crimes punishable by life imprisonment without the possibility of parole. Yet, neither CR \u00a7 3-303, CR \u00a7 3-305, nor the general concept of permitting jury sentencing for crimes punishable by life imprisonment without the possibility of parole, is mentioned in Senate Bill 276's language, purpose clause, preamble, or Revised Fiscal and Policy Note.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-103\">\n   Moreover, although perhaps stating the obvious, Senate Bill 276 did not affect just CR (2012) \u00a7 2-304; Senate Bill 276 repealed or amended several statutes in different articles of the Code of Maryland to effectuate the General Assembly's repeal of the death penalty. CR (2012) \u00a7 2-304 was but one of several statutes that mentioned the death penalty, and thus needed to be repealed or amended. For example, in several instances across multiple statutes, the General Assembly simply\n   deleted the words \"death or\" before the words \"imprisonment\" or \"life imprisonment.\"\n   <em>\n    See, e.g.\n   </em>\n   ,\n   <extracted-citation index=\"61\" url=\"https://cite.case.law/citations/?q=2013%20Md.%20Laws%202302\">\n    2013 Md. Laws 2302\n   </extracted-citation>\n   , 2306, 2307, 2308, 2322, 2323 (Vol. III, Ch. 156, S.B. 276). In other instances, the General Assembly deleted the words and sections that referenced \"the death penalty\" or \"a capital case.\"\n   <em>\n    See, e.g.\n   </em>\n   ,\n   <extracted-citation index=\"62\" url=\"https://cite.case.law/citations/?q=2013%20Md.%20Laws%202301\">\n    2013 Md. Laws 2301\n   </extracted-citation>\n   , 2305 (Vol. III, Ch. 156, S.B. 276). These circumstances demonstrate that Senate Bill 276 was concerned strictly with striking all references to the death penalty. Indeed, the General Assembly's amendment of CR (2012) \u00a7 2-304(a)-including striking the reference in CR (2012) \u00a7 2-304(a)(1) of the State giving notice of intent to seek the death penalty, and striking in its entirety CR (2012) \u00a7 2-304(a)(2), which addressed the circumstance where the trial court or jury determines that the death sentence may not be imposed-without amending CR (2012) \u00a7 2-304(b), which does not explicitly mention or use words referencing the death penalty, demonstrates that the General Assembly's sole focus was repealing the death penalty and striking references to the death penalty, not making any other substantive changes in any of the affected statutes.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-104\">\n   After thorough review of Senate Bill 276's legislative history, we conclude that the Bill's legislative history unequivocally demonstrates that the General Assembly's sole intent was to repeal the death penalty, and CR (2012) \u00a7 2-304 was amended as\n   part of the repeal of the death penalty. After the General Assembly eliminated the reference in CR (2012) \u00a7 2-304(a)(1) to the State giving notice of intent to seek the death penalty, and eliminated CR (2012) \u00a7 2-304(a)(2) in its entirety, CR \u00a7 2-304(a) now simply provides that, if the State gave notice of intent to seek life imprisonment without the possibility of parole, \"the court shall conduct a separate sentencing proceeding as soon as practicable after the defendant is found guilty of murder in the first degree to determine whether the defendant shall be sentenced to imprisonment for life without the possibility of parole or to imprisonment for life.\" In other words, the trial court has the responsibility for conducting the sentencing proceeding and determining whether to impose life imprisonment without the possibility of parole.\n   To be sure, CR (2012) \u00a7 2-304(b), which existed prior to the General Assembly's amendment of CR (2012) \u00a7 2-304(a), remains intact. In the process of repealing the death penalty and amending CR (2012) \u00a7 2-304(a) and other statutes, CR (2012) \u00a7 2-304(b) was not amended or deleted. Conceivably, this inaction was due to the circumstance that Senate Bill 276's focus was identifying, and deleting, express references to the death penalty. Because CR \u00a7 2-304(b) lacks an express reference to the death penalty, it may not have been addressed in the amendment process for that reason. In any event, we observe that CR \u00a7 2-304(b) does not contain any provision empowering a jury to conduct a sentencing proceeding independent of what previously existed in CR (2012) \u00a7 2-304(a)(2); indeed, under CR (2012) \u00a7 2-304, subsection (b) became operative only if a jury chose not to impose the death penalty under CR (2012) \u00a7 2-304(a)(2). Plainly put, standing alone, CR \u00a7 2-304(b) is not a grant of authority or empowerment for a jury to conduct a sentencing proceeding to determine whether to impose life imprisonment without the possibility of parole. Rather, CR \u00a7 2-304(b) merely explains how a jury's determination was to be handled under the circumstances that existed before the repeal of the death penalty. It is evident that CR \u00a7 2-304(b) is a vestige of CR (2012) \u00a7 2-304 that is no longer operative in light of the General Assembly's repeal of the death penalty.\n   <footnotemark>\n    7\n   </footnotemark>\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-105\">\n   We have no hesitancy whatsoever in concluding that, with Senate Bill 276, the General Assembly's intent was only to repeal the death penalty, and not to grant a defendant who is\n   convicted of first-degree murder the right to have a jury determine whether to impose life imprisonment without the possibility of parole where the State has filed a notice of intent to seek such a sentence. With respect to legislative intent, we make the obvious point that, had it desired to do so, the General Assembly easily could have introduced and enacted a bill, or even fashioned a provision of Senate Bill 276, to provide that, where the State seeks life imprisonment without the possibility of parole, and where a defendant is convicted of first-degree murder,\n   the defendant has the right to choose to have either a trial court or a jury determine whether to impose life imprisonment without the possibility of parole.\n   <em>\n    Cf.

In our view, the General Assembly's inaction with respect to bills that were introduced after Senate Bill 276 was passed in 2013 is not indicative of an intent on the part of the General Assembly to create a right for a defendant who is convicted of first-degree murder to have a jury determine whether to impose life imprisonment without the possibility of parole. Simply put, we conclude that legislative action speaks louder than legislative inaction; and, here, the legislative action in question is that the General Assembly repealed the death penalty-nothing more, nothing less. As discussed in detail\n   above, an examination of the circumstances of that repeal reveals that the General Assembly did not intend to do more than repeal the death penalty, and certainly did not intent to disturb the established principle, as set forth in this Court's holding in\n   <em>\n    Woods\n   </em>\n   , that a trial court, not a jury, decides whether to impose life imprisonment without the possibility of parole where a defendant is convicted of first-degree murder and the State has provided the requisite notice of its intent to seek such a sentence.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-113\">\n   Finally, although we conclude that CR \u00a7 2-304 is ambiguous, we determine that, contrary to Bellard's contention, the rule of lenity does not apply under the circumstances of this case. In\n   <em>\n    Oglesby v. State\n   </em>\n   ,\n   <extracted-citation case-ids=\"4024904\" index=\"70\" url=\"https://cite.case.law/md/441/673/#p676\">\n    441 Md. 673\n   </extracted-citation>\n   , 676, 681,\n   <extracted-citation case-ids=\"4024904\" index=\"71\" url=\"https://cite.case.law/md/441/673/#p676\">\n    109 A.3d 1147\n   </extracted-citation>\n   , 1149, 1151-52 (2015), we described the rule of lenity as follows:\n  </p>\n  <blockquote id=\"p-114\">\n   When a court construes a criminal statute, it may invoke a principle known as the \"rule of lenity\" when the statute is open to more than one interpretation and the court is otherwise unable to determine which interpretation was intended by the [General Assembly]. Instead of arbitrarily choosing one of the competing interpretations, the court selects the interpretation that treats the defendant more leniently. The rule of lenity is not so much a tool of statutory construction as a default device to decide\n   which interpretation prevails when the tools of statutory construction fail.\n  </blockquote>\n  <blockquote id=\"p-115\">\n   ...\n  </blockquote>\n  <blockquote id=\"p-116\">\n   The \"rule of lenity\" is not a rule in the usual sense, but an aid for dealing with ambiguity in a criminal statute. Under the rule of lenity, a court confronted with an otherwise unresolvable ambiguity in a criminal statute that allows for two possible interpretations of the statute will opt for the construction that favors the defendant. For a court construing a statute, the rule of lenity is not a means for determining-or defeating-legislative intent. Rather, it is a tie-goes-to-the-runner device that the court may turn to when it despairs of fathoming how the General Assembly intended\n   that the statute be applied in the particular circumstances. It is a tool of last resort, to be rarely deployed and applied only when all other tools of statutory construction fail to resolve an ambiguity. This follows from the fact that our goal in construing statutes is always to ascertain and carry out the legislative purpose of the statute and not to seek out an interpretation that necessarily favors one party or the other.\n  </blockquote>\n  <p id=\"p-117\">\n   (Citations and footnote omitted). And, in\n   <em>\n    State v. Johnson\n   </em>\n   ,\n   <extracted-citation case-ids=\"4184796\" index=\"72\" url=\"https://cite.case.law/md/442/211/#p218\">\n    442 Md. 211\n   </extracted-citation>\n   , 218-19,\n   <extracted-citation case-ids=\"4184796\" index=\"73\" url=\"https://cite.case.law/md/442/211/#p218\">\n    112 A.3d 383\n   </extracted-citation>\n   , 387 (2015), we stated: \"The rule of lenity allows a court to avoid interpreting a criminal statute so as to increase the penalty that it places on an individual when such an interpretation can be based on no more than a guess as to what the General Assembly intended.\" (Citation, brackets, and internal quotation marks omitted). Basically, the rule of lenity applies where there is no evidence of legislative intent with respect to an ambiguous statute-\n   <em>\n    i.e.\n   </em>\n   , the ambiguity cannot be resolved under the traditional principles of statutory construction.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-118\">\n   In this case, although we concluded that CR \u00a7 2-304's language is ambiguous and we turned to additional tools of statutory construction to ascertain the General Assembly's intent, the tools of statutory construction did not fail-Senate Bill 276's legislative history plainly demonstrates that the General Assembly's sole purpose was to repeal the death penalty, not to grant a defendant a right to jury sentencing, or to expand a jury's role to a sentencing determination, where a defendant is convicted of first-degree murder and the State seeks life imprisonment without the possibility of parole. With certainty, Senate Bill 276's legislative history shows that the General Assembly did not intend to alter the existing sentencing procedures where the State seeks life imprisonment without the possibility of parole after a first-degree murder conviction-namely, that the trial court conducts the sentencing proceeding to determine whether to impose life imprisonment without the possibility of parole; and a jury has no role in the sentencing. Accordingly, we need not resort to the rule of lenity.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-119\">\n   In sum, we conclude that, under CR \u00a7 2-304(a), based on the statute's legislative history and relevant case law-namely,\n   <em>\n    Woods\n   </em>\n   -where a defendant is convicted of first-degree murder and the State has given notice of an intent to seek life imprisonment without the possibility of parole, the trial court, not the jury, determines whether to sentence the defendant to life imprisonment or life imprisonment without the possibility of parole. In other words, CR \u00a7 2-304 does not grant a defendant who is convicted of first-degree murder the right to have a jury determine whether to impose life imprisonment without the possibility of parole. Therefore, in this case, the circuit court did not err in denying Bellard's motion to strike the State's notice and in striking, or denying,\n   Bellard's notice of election to be sentenced by a jury.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-120\">\n   <strong>\n    II.\n   </strong>\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-121\">\n   <strong>\n    The Parties' Contentions\n   </strong>\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-122\">\n   Bellard contends that Maryland's sentencing scheme for life imprisonment without the possibility of parole is unconstitutional for three reasons. First, Bellard argues that the relevant statutes do not \"restrict, guide[,] or limit\" the State's discretion to determine whether to seek life imprisonment without the possibility of parole. Second, Bellard asserts that the pertinent statutes do not provide the sentencing authority, whether a trial court or a jury, with \"any meaningful guidance\" regarding what considerations are relevant in determining whether to impose life imprisonment or life imprisonment without the possibility of parole. Third, Bellard maintains that the relevant statutes do not require a trial court to determine that the State has established the existence of any factors that justify life imprisonment without the possibility of parole, and do not require a jury to find, beyond a reasonable doubt, the existence of any such factors. In sum, Bellard contends that Maryland's sentencing scheme for life imprisonment without the possibility of parole violates the Fifth, Sixth, Eighth, and Fourteenth Amendments to the United States Constitution and Articles 16, 21, and 22 of the Maryland Declaration of\n   Rights because it permits the imposition of life imprisonment without the possibility of parole \"in the absence of any eligibility factors or predicate findings[.]\"\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-123\">\n   The State responds that the United States Constitution and the Maryland Declaration of Rights permit the imposition of life imprisonment without the possibility of parole in the same manner as every other sentence except the death penalty. The State points out that both this Court and the Supreme Court have rejected the contention that life imprisonment without the possibility of parole can be imposed only under the same constitutional protections and procedure that are required when the death penalty is imposed. The State argues that, in\n   <em>\n    Woods\n   </em>\n   , this Court rebuffed the first two constitutional arguments raised by Bellard-namely, that Maryland's sentencing scheme for life imprisonment without the possibility of parole is unconstitutional because it does not limit prosecutorial discretion in seeking such a sentence, and because it fails to provide meaningful guidance to the sentencing authority.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-124\">\n   <strong>\n    Standard of Review\n   </strong>\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-125\">\n   \"An appellate court reviews without deference whether a trial court's decision was constitutional.\"\n   <em>\n    State v.

Bellard's reliance on\n   <em>\n    Apprendi\n   </em>\n   in support of this contention is misplaced.\n   <em>\n    Apprendi\n   </em>\n   is plainly a different case than this; it involved circumstances in which facts were required to be proven to increase the penalty for a crime beyond the prescribed statutory maximum; specifically, in that case, under New Jersey's hate crime law, the prosecution could seek an extended term of imprisonment beyond the statutory range of imprisonment authorized for the offense at issue.\n   <em>\n    See Apprendi\n   </em>\n   ,\n   <extracted-citation case-ids=\"9413911\" index=\"157\" url=\"https://cite.case.law/us/530/466/#p468\">\n    530 U.S. at 468-69, 490\n   </extracted-citation>\n   ,\n   <extracted-citation case-ids=\"9413911\" index=\"158\" url=\"https://cite.case.law/us/530/466/#p468\">\n    120 S.Ct. 2348\n   </extracted-citation>\n   .

The key difference in this case, however, is that, in Maryland, life imprisonment without the possibility of parole is not a penalty beyond the prescribed statutory maximum for first-degree murder-it is the statutory maximum. Thus, in this case, no fact must be established to\n   increase the penalty for first-degree murder beyond the statutory maximum; the statutory maximum penalty-life imprisonment without the possibility of parole-had been sought by the State and imposed by the circuit court.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-161\">\n   Significantly, in\n   <em>\n    Apprendi\n   </em>\n   ,\n   <em>\n    <extracted-citation case-ids=\"9413911\" index=\"161\" url=\"https://cite.case.law/us/530/466/#p468\">\n     id.\n    </extracted-citation>\n   </em>\n   <extracted-citation case-ids=\"9413911\" index=\"161\" url=\"https://cite.case.law/us/530/466/#p468\">\n    at 481\n   </extracted-citation>\n   ,\n   <extracted-citation case-ids=\"9413911\" index=\"162\" url=\"https://cite.case.law/us/530/466/#p468\">\n    120 S.Ct. 2348\n   </extracted-citation>\n   , the Supreme Court recognized that it is permissible for trial courts to exercise broad discretion when \"imposing sentence within statutory limits in the individual case[,]\" and such discretion is bound only \"by the range of sentencing options prescribed by the legislature.\" (Citations and emphasis omitted).
