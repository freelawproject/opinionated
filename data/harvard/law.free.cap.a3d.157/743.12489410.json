Consiglio, Ruth F. Consiglio, and Richard E. Consiglio, individually, and as executor of the estate of Flora Consiglio. The plaintiffs claim that the court improperly concluded that no genuine issue of material fact existed as to any count of their operative complaint. We affirm the judgment of the trial court.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-11\">\n   Mindful of the procedural posture of the case, we set forth the following facts as gleaned from the pleadings, affidavits, and other proof submitted, viewed in a light most favorable to the plaintiff. See\n   <em>\n    Martinelli\n   </em>\n   v.\n   <em>\n    Fusi\n   </em>\n   ,\n   <extracted-citation case-ids=\"4143430\" index=\"0\" url=\"https://cite.case.law/conn/290/347/#p350\">\n    290 Conn. 347\n   </extracted-citation>\n   , 350,\n   <extracted-citation index=\"1\" url=\"https://cite.case.law/citations/?q=963%20A.2d%20640\">\n    963 A.2d 640\n   </extracted-citation>\n   (2009). The defendants are owners of Sally's Apizza (Sally's), a culinary landmark on Wooster Street in New Haven. In 2013, the defendants entertained offers to purchase Sally's and the land on which it is situated. One such offer was made on December 3, 2013, by \"Al Dente, LLC, a to be formed Connecticut limited liability company\" comprised of Capasso and five other individuals, including\n   his brother, Vincent Capasso, Kristen Keslow, Marc Keslow, and Tara Knight (collectively, original entity).\n   <footnotemark>\n    1\n   </footnotemark>\n   Weeks earlier, the original\n   entity had retained Brenner, Saltzman &amp; Wallman, LLP (law firm), to help prepare that offer and to organize Al Dente, LLC. The November 26, 2013 retainer agreement furnished by the law firm and \"[a]ccepted, acknowledged, and agreed to\" by Capasso was addressed to six individuals-Knight, Capasso, Kristen Keslow, Marc Keslow, Vincent, Capasso's brother, and Giuseppe DeLucia-and outlined \"the terms and conditions upon which [the law firm] will undertake to represent you.... In connection with the organization of Al Dente, LLC, we will undertake to represent the new entity and the six of you collectively in your capacity as organizers and initial owners of Al Dente, LLC.\"\n   <footnotemark>\n    2\n   </footnotemark>\n   The law firm drafted the\n   December 3, 2013 written agreement to purchase Sally's, which Capasso signed on behalf of the original entity.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-12\">\n   The defendants received several bids in excess of one million dollars. Capasso thereafter grew concerned that the original entity's bid was being \"used to get [other bidders] to offer more and to increase [the] purchase price ....\" He therefore informed the defendants that the original entity would not \"continue with the purchase of Sally's unless [they] came to an agreement [on] a bidding process to set the [c]ontract purchase price and to keep final bids confidential.\" On March 27, 2014, members of the original entity met with certain defendants and their legal representatives, at which time they orally agreed to the following protocols regarding the bidding process for the purchase of Sally's (collectively, bidding agreement): (1) initial bids would be disclosed to all parties presenting offers; (2) final bids would be due by 5 p.m. on April 14, 2014; (3) the identities of the bidding parties would remain confidential; (4) any bids submitted after that deadline would not be accepted; and (5) the highest bid would set the sale price. The defendants further agreed to \"commence negotiations for sale with the highest bidder\" following the submission of final bids. Consistent with the foregoing, Attorney Robert W. Lynch, acting on behalf of the defendants,\n   <footnotemark>\n    3\n   </footnotemark>\n   disclosed\n   the results of the first round of bidding in an April 7, 2014 e-mail to the bidding parties. In that correspondence, Lynch also apprised the parties that \"[t]here will be one more round of bidding with all bids due by 5 p.m.\" on April 14, 2014.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-13\">\n   Capasso submitted a timely second bid on behalf of the original entity in an April 14, 2014 e-mail to Lynch. Attached to that e-mail was a letter addressed to the\n   defendants regarding the \"Purchase and Sale of Assets and Real Property.\" That correspondence contained a proposed \"agreement [that] sets forth the terms and conditions for the acquisition ... of the pizzeria business known as Sally's ... together with the real property located at 237 and 245 Wooster Street ....\" Twelve pages in length, that proposed agreement states that it \"contains all material terms and conditions of the Purchase Transaction and is intended to obligate Seller and Purchaser to consummate the transactions contemplated hereby. It is, accordingly, the intent of the parties hereto that this agreement constitute a legally binding and enforceable agreement.\" The proposed agreement also contains a merger clause, as \u00a7 9 (c) states that \"[t]his agreement constitutes the entire agreement among the parties with respect to the matters covered hereby and supersedes all prior agreements, understandings, offers, and negotiations (oral or written). This agreement may be amended or modified only by a subsequent agreement in writing signed by each of the parties.\" The proposed agreement concludes by prescribing an exclusive method of acceptance, stating: \"If you are in agreement with the terms of this agreement, please so indicate by countersigning this letter in the appropriate space below, whereupon this agreement shall become a binding agreement among the signatories hereto.\" None of the defendants signed that agreement.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-14\">\n   At approximately 5:30 p.m. on the evening of April 14, 2014, Lynch e-mailed the bidding parties and disclosed the amounts of two new bids.\n   <footnotemark>\n    4\n   </footnotemark>\n   He further stated that \"[w]e plan to meet with the [defendants] to go over the new bids and negotiate the terms and conditions\n   of the purchase agreement.\" After learning that the original entity was the high bidder, Capasso emailed Lynch on April 15, 2014, stating in relevant part: \"Please let us know if you need to meet with us to go over the terms of our proposal. Look forward to working with you.\" The following day, Knight e-mailed Lynch. Noting that \"[f]rom your e-mail it appears we have the highest offer,\" Knight inquired as to the \"next step\" in the process.\n   <footnotemark>\n    5\n   </footnotemark>\n   On April 17, 2014, Lynch replied that \"Greenberg and I need to review your contract with our clients and make a list of issues that need to be worked out.\"\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-15\">\n   On April 21, 2014, Capasso again e-mailed Lynch, stating that he was \"following up to see if any terms within our bid need to be worked through.\"\n   <footnotemark>\n    6\n   </footnotemark>\n   Capasso further stated that \"[d]uring our [March 27, 2014] meeting with the [defendants] the parameters of the sale were brought up and we were informed that the highest price at the last bid would prevail and that the terms of the sale would be worked out. It has been brought to my attention that the condition of expansion and the pizza [oven] are not acceptable to the [defendants].\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-16\">\n   Please strike this term from our proposal. Please let us know if there are any other terms within our proposal that are not acceptable to the [defendants] and we will work out those terms as well\" Lynch subsequently informed Capasso that he needed to meet with his clients \"to go over the contract and see what issues they have. We will then prepare a joint response with [Greenberg] and his client and will send the joint response to you for your review and comment.\"\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-17\">\n   On May 9, 2014, Lynch sent an e-mail to the law firm, which stated simply: \"Here are the comments of the [defendants] to the latest Al Dente proposal.\" Attached\n   to that e-mail was a one page document containing nine comments regarding the April 14, 2014 agreement (comment sheet).\n   <footnotemark>\n    7\n   </footnotemark>\n   In an e-mail sent to the law firm later that day, Capasso stated that \"[o]ur group will be meeting to discuss the comments this weekend.\"\n   <footnotemark>\n    8\n   </footnotemark>\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-18\">\n   On May 14, 2014, Capasso sent Lynch a two sentence letter that reads: \"Enclosed, please find our signed counter offer with our deposit check for Sally's. Please get back to us with a closing date.\"\n   <footnotemark>\n    9\n   </footnotemark>\n   Appended to that letter were two documents. The first was a cashier's check in the amount of $333,000 payable to \"Robert W. Lynch Trustee\" and \"Lawrence J. Greenberg Trustee.\" The second was a modified version of the comment\n   sheet, to which the following had been added: \"Addendum To Contract Signed 4/14/2014. The foregoing nine (9) terms submitted by the Seller are hereby confirmed to be additional to the Contract signed 4/14/2014 and are made a part thereof\" (addendum sheet).\n   <footnotemark>\n    10\n   </footnotemark>\n   Capasso signed that document, as did a notary public and two \"witnesses\" thereto.\n   <footnotemark>\n    11\n   </footnotemark>\n   Notably,\n   that document was not signed by any of the defendants.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-19\">\n   As Robert G. Consiglio swore in his affidavit, the defendants instructed Lynch \"to return the unsolicited 'deposit check.' \" By letter dated May 20, 2014, and addressed to Attorneys Samuel M. Hurwitz and Jennifer Deakin at the law firm, Lynch stated: \"Enclosed please find the unsolicited cashier's check which was delivered to our office last week.\" Later that day, Deakin emailed Lynch and Greenberg to inform them that \"[o]ur client was troubled to learn that your clients do not believe they have a binding agreement with [the original entity] based on the bid procedures established by their counsel. [The original entity] believes it has a binding agreement with your clients as a result of the bid procedures and related events and remains ready, willing and able to complete the transactions on the basis of that agreement. Please advise on a closing date.\" Lynch replied approximately one hour later, stating that \"[w]e don't have a binding agreement with any potential purchaser at this time nor has there been any decision as to who the purchaser will be. The [original entity's] bid is still being considered but no decision has been made.\"\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-20\">\n   Seven weeks later, Deakin sent a letter dated July 8, 2014, to Lynch and Greenberg, in which she communicated the original entity's concern that \"your clients are\n   continuing to solicit and/or consider bids to purchase Sally's ....\"\n   <footnotemark>\n    12\n   </footnotemark>\n   Deakin stated that the original entity \"won the bid to purchase Sally's pursuant to such sealed bid procedures, and, further, has a binding agreement with your clients to purchase Sally's.\" Deakin thus indicated that the original entity \"remains ready, willing and able to consummate the closing of the purchase and sale of Sally's under the terms and conditions of its agreement with your clients that it has negotiated in good faith.\" If the defendants failed to proceed with the transaction, Deakin cautioned, the original entity was \"prepared to take all measures, including legal action ....\" Nevertheless, a majority of the members of the original entity ultimately voted against taking any legal action against the defendants, and so informed Capasso and his brother Vincent.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-21\">\n   On July 19, 2014, a limited liability company operating agreement was executed for the entity known as Al Dente, LLC. That agreement was signed by Capasso and his brother Vincent, and described the two as sole and equal interest members thereof.\n   <footnotemark>\n    13\n   </footnotemark>\n   Capasso thereafter retained the counsel of Attorney Laurence V. Parnoff, who prepared a complaint on behalf of the plaintiffs, which was served on the defendants on August 20, 2014. That complaint contained three counts. The first sounded in breach of contract-specifically the breach of a purchase agreement stemming from the comment sheet, which the plaintiffs characterized as\n   a \"counteroffer,\" acceptance of which allegedly was memorialized in the addendum sheet. The second count alleged breach of the bidding agreement.\n   <footnotemark>\n    14\n   </footnotemark>\n   The third count, derivative of the second, alleged a violation of the Connecticut Unfair Trade Practices Act (CUTPA), General Statutes \u00a7 42-110a et seq.\n   <footnotemark>\n    15\n   </footnotemark>\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-22\">\n   In their respective answers, the defendants denied the substance of those allegations. Following a period of time in which the parties conducted extensive discovery,\n   <footnotemark>\n    16\n   </footnotemark>\n   the defendants moved for summary judgment in February, 2005, claiming, inter alia, that \"[t]here is no dispute of fact that the parties never entered into a contract because there was no manifestation of mutual assent; further, submitting the highest bid does not establish an enforceable contract under Connecticut law ....\" The plaintiffs, in turn, filed a memorandum of law in opposition. The court heard argument on the motion for summary judgment on June 16, 2015. By memorandum of decision dated August 10, 2015, the court concluded that no genuine issue of material fact existed as to whether the defendants entered into a\n   purchase agreement with the plaintiffs. It further determined that no such issue existed with respect to the alleged breach of the bidding agreement.\n   <footnotemark>\n    17\n   </footnotemark>\n   Accordingly, the court rendered summary judgment in favor of the defendants on all counts, and this appeal followed.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-23\">\n   Before considering the particular claims advanced by the plaintiffs in this appeal, we note the well-established standard of review governing a court's grant of summary judgment. \"The fundamental purpose of summary judgment is preventing unnecessary trials.\"\n   <em>\n    Stuart\n   </em>\n   v.\n   <em>\n    Freiberg\n   </em>\n   ,\n   <extracted-citation index=\"2\" url=\"https://cite.case.law/citations/?q=316%20Conn.%20809\">\n    316 Conn. 809\n   </extracted-citation>\n   , 822,\n   <extracted-citation index=\"3\" url=\"https://cite.case.law/citations/?q=116%20A.3d%201195\">\n    116 A.3d 1195\n   </extracted-citation>\n   (2015). \" Practice Book [\u00a7 17-49 ] provides that summary judgment shall be rendered forthwith if the pleadings, affidavits and any other proof submitted show that there is no genuine issue as to any material fact and that the moving party is entitled to judgment as a matter of law....

Our review of a grant of summary judgment is plenary.\n   <em>\n    Stuart\n   </em>\n   v.\n   <em>\n    Freiberg\n   </em>\n   , supra, at 821,\n   <extracted-citation index=\"7\" url=\"https://cite.case.law/citations/?q=116%20A.3d%201195\">\n    116 A.3d 1195\n   </extracted-citation>\n   .\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-24\">\n   I\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-25\">\n   The plaintiffs' primary contention is that a genuine issue of material fact exists as to whether the defendants breached the bidding agreement by \"unilaterally\" withdrawing from negotiations. We disagree.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-26\">\n   Construed in a light most favorable to the plaintiffs, the affidavits and other proof presented indicate that the parties reached an agreement on March 27, 2014, regarding the terms of the bidding process. The plaintiffs maintain, and the defendants concede, that the defendants at that time agreed that they would \"commence negotiations for sale with the highest bidder\" following the submission of final bids on April 14, 2014. As high bidder, the plaintiffs contend that they \"had the right and the [d]efendants had the duty to have negotiations of the terms\" of the April 14, 2014 proposed agreement.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-27\">\n   It is undisputed that such negotiations transpired between the parties, as the plaintiffs acknowledge in their appellate brief.\n   <footnotemark>\n    18\n   </footnotemark>\n   Following the conclusion of the bidding period, the defendants notified the original entity that they were reviewing its proposal to \"negotiate the terms and conditions of the purchase agreement.\" Approximately one week later, Capasso contacted Lynch and offered to remove certain details from the pending proposal, stating: \"It has been brought to my attention that the condition of expansion and the\n   pizza [oven] are not acceptable to the [defendants]. Please strike this term from our proposal. Please let us know if there are any other terms within our proposal that are not acceptable to the [defendants] and we will work out those terms as well.\" In response, Lynch advised Capasso that the defendants would review that proposal and then \"send [a] response to you for your review and comment.\" The defendants thereafter circulated the comment sheet to the plaintiffs, at which time Capasso prepared and signed the addendum sheet, which he mailed to the defendants' representatives along with a deposit check. On May 20, 2014, Lynch returned that check to the law firm. Negotiations between the parties at that point ceased.\n   <footnotemark>\n    19\n   </footnotemark>\n   On appeal, the plaintiffs argue that the defendants breached the terms of the bidding agreement by \"unilaterally abandoning\" those negotiations. No such allegations, however, are contained in the plaintiffs' complaint, nor were such allegations advanced in the proceeding before the trial court. Construed in the light most favorable to the plaintiffs, the complaint and\n   related documentation establishes, at best, a contractual duty on the part of the defendants to engage in preliminary negotiations over the terms of a purchase agreement. Absent from the complaint are any allegations that the defendants acted in bad faith or that the bidding agreement required negotiations of a certain character or duration. See, e.g.,\n   <em>\n    Grenier\n   </em>\n   v.\n   <em>\n    Commissioner of Transportation\n   </em>\n   ,\n   <extracted-citation index=\"8\" url=\"https://cite.case.law/citations/?q=306%20Conn.%20523\">\n    306 Conn. 523\n   </extracted-citation>\n   , 537,\n   <extracted-citation index=\"9\" url=\"https://cite.case.law/citations/?q=51%20A.3d%20367\">\n    51 A.3d 367\n   </extracted-citation>\n   (2012) (pleadings must provide sufficient notice of facts claimed and issues to be tried and cannot surprise or prejudice opposing party);\n   <em>\n    A-Right Plumbing, Sewer &amp; Water Main Co., LLC\n   </em>\n   v.\n   <em>\n    Aquarion Operating Services Co\n   </em>\n   .,\n   <extracted-citation case-ids=\"3951293\" index=\"10\" url=\"https://cite.case.law/conn/282/612/#p613\">\n    282 Conn. 612\n   </extracted-citation>\n   , 613,\n   <extracted-citation index=\"11\" url=\"https://cite.case.law/citations/?q=922%20A.2d%201084\">\n    922 A.2d 1084\n   </extracted-citation>\n   (2007) (summary judgment rendered when plaintiff \"never raised\" specific claim in its complaint). The materials that accompanied the plaintiffs' opposition to the motion for summary judgment likewise do not contain any evidence to substantiate such allegations. See\n   <em>\n    Feliciano\n   </em>\n   v.\n   <em>\n    Autozone, Inc\n   </em>\n   .,\n   <extracted-citation index=\"12\" url=\"https://cite.case.law/citations/?q=316%20Conn.%2065\">\n    316 Conn. 65\n   </extracted-citation>\n   , 72-73,\n   <extracted-citation index=\"13\" url=\"https://cite.case.law/citations/?q=111%20A.3d%20453\">\n    111 A.3d 453\n   </extracted-citation>\n   (2015) (party opposing motion for summary judgment must provide evidentiary foundation to demonstrate existence of genuine issue of material fact).\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-28\">\n   The record before us indicates that the defendants agreed to engage in negotiations following Capasso's submission of the highest bid. The record further indicates that those negotiations transpired. We, therefore, agree with the trial court that no genuine issue of material fact exists as to whether the defendants breached the bidding agreement with the plaintiffs by concluding negotiations on May 20, 2014. For that reason, the court properly rendered summary judgment on the second count of the complaint, as well as the derivative CUTPA claim.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-29\">\n   II\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-30\">\n   We next consider whether a genuine issue of material fact exists as to whether the defendants entered into\n   a binding purchase agreement with the plaintiffs, as alleged in the first count of the complaint. That count alleges in relevant part that \"[b]y May 14, 2014, the [p]laintiffs and [d]efendants entered into an agreement, by the terms of which the [p]laintiffs agreed to buy and [the defendants] agreed to sell [Sally's] for a single cash payment ....\" That agreement, the complaint alleges, sprung from the \"[p]laintiffs' acceptance of the [d]efendants' counteroffer to the agreement ....\" We conclude, from the pleadings, affidavits, and other proof submitted, that a binding agreement to purchase Sally's was never reached by the parties.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-31\">\n   At the outset, we note what is not at issue. Under Connecticut law, \"[a] bid is a binding offer to make a con\n   tract.... A bid ... submitted in response to an invitation for bids is only an offer which, until accepted ... does not give rise to a contract between the parties.\" (Citation omitted.)\n   <em>\n    John J. Brennan Construction Corp., Inc\n   </em>\n   . v.\n   <em>\n    Shelton\n   </em>\n   ,\n   <extracted-citation case-ids=\"497614\" index=\"14\" url=\"https://cite.case.law/conn/187/695/#p702\">\n    187 Conn. 695\n   </extracted-citation>\n   , 702,\n   <extracted-citation index=\"15\" url=\"https://cite.case.law/citations/?q=448%20A.2d%20180\">\n    448 A.2d 180\n   </extracted-citation>\n   , 184 (1982). On April 14, 2014, the plaintiffs submitted a final bid to purchase Sally's and the real property on which it is situated, which was accompanied by a written proposal delineating the terms and conditions thereof.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-32\">\n   By its plain language, that proposed agreement required the signatures of the defendants to establish \"a binding agreement among the signatories hereto.\" The record reflects that none of the defendants ever signed that agreement. It further is undisputed that, upon receipt of the deposit check and addendum sheet prepared and signed by Capasso, the defendants did not sign the addendum sheet and directed their counsel to return that check. Accordingly, there is no claim in this case that the defendants entered into a purchase agreement by accepting either the April 14, 2014 proposed agreement or the May 14, 2014 addendum sheet.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-33\">\n   Rather, the plaintiffs submit that a genuine issue of material fact exists as to whether the defendants, in circulating the comment sheet, intended to surrender their power of acceptance and bind themselves to a purchase agreement with the plaintiffs. In the plaintiffs' view, the comment sheet, when \"read within [context of] the email and document chain,\" constituted a counteroffer that incorporated the terms of the April 14, 2014 proposed agreement in all material respects, as augmented by the nine specific comments detailed in the comment sheet.\n   <footnotemark>\n    20\n   </footnotemark>\n   We disagree.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-34\">\n   The April 14, 2014 proposed agreement, the terms of which the defendants allegedly incorporated into that counteroffer, required the signatures of all interested parties. That requirement certainly was understandable, as the agreement, because it involved the conveyance of real property, implicated the statute of frauds and, thus, required it to be signed.\n   <footnotemark>\n    21\n   </footnotemark>\n   The comment sheet, however, was not signed by\n   <em>\n    any\n   </em>\n   of the defendants in this case.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-35\">\n   Beyond that glaring, and perhaps fatal, deficiency, the record reveals no basis on which the finder of fact objectively could conclude that the defendants intended the comment sheet to constitute a counteroffer that terminated their power of acceptance. See\n   <em>\n    Cavallo\n   </em>\n   v.\n   <em>\n    Lewis\n   </em>\n   ,\n   <extracted-citation case-ids=\"772827\" index=\"16\" url=\"https://cite.case.law/conn-app/1/519/#p521\">\n    1 Conn.App. 519\n   </extracted-citation>\n   , 521,\n   <extracted-citation index=\"17\" url=\"https://cite.case.law/citations/?q=473%20A.2d%20338\">\n    473 A.2d 338\n   </extracted-citation>\n   (1984)\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-36\">\n   counteroffer terminates offeree's power of acceptance). As the Restatement (Second) of Contracts explains, \"[a] mere inquiry regarding the possibility of different terms ... or a comment upon the terms of the offer, is ordinarily not a counter-offer. Such responses to an offer may be too tentative or indefinite to be offers of any kind.\" 1 Restatement (Second), Contracts \u00a7 39, comment (b), p. 106 (1981); accord 1 E. Farnsworth, Contracts (3d Ed. 2004) \u00a7 3.20, pp. 314-15 (\"mere request for modification ... does not ordinarily\" constitute counteroffer).\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-37\">\n   Several of the concerns raised in the comment sheet are highly tentative and indefinite in nature. For example, the third comment states that \"[o]ur accountants suggest allocating the purchase price\" in a certain manner, while the sixth comment vaguely states that \"[w]e need an exception to the confidentiality provision for attorneys, accountants and advisors.\" Similarly, the eighth comment states that \"Ruth Consiglio would like a license\" to access a grapevine on the property being conveyed. Such generalized concerns do not resemble the sort of definitive contractual terminology commonplace in million dollar purchase agreements.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-38\">\n   Equally significant, the defendants steadfastly characterized the concerns raised in the comment sheet as \"issues\" and \"comments\" regarding the plaintiffs' April 14, 2014 proposed agreement. For example, in an April 21, 2014 email, Lynch advised Capasso that the defendants \"will give you a complete list of comments for you to review with your group after we have completed our review of the contract.\" In a similar email to Knight on April 17, 2014, Lynch stated that he needed \"to review your contract with [the defendants] and make a list of issues that need to be worked out.\" In a final communication that preceded the circulation of the comment sheet, Lynch informed Capasso that he and Greenberg were preparing \"a joint response\" that they \"will send to\n   you\n   <em>\n    for your review and comment\n   </em>\n   .\" (Emphasis added.) Those communications give context to the comment sheet, a stark one page document bereft of any letterhead, date, signatures, or identification of parties that merely enumerates nine concerns with the plaintiffs' proposed agreement. In addition, we note that the comment sheet is titled \"Comments to Al Dente Contract\" and contains no representation that it was intended either to terminate the defendants' power of acceptance or to constitute a counteroffer that bound the defendants thereto.

Although it articulates various issues that the defendants had with the April 14, 2014 proposed agreement, the comment sheet does not contain any rejection-explicit or implicit-of that proposal. Moreover, when read in context\n   of the communications between the parties, it is apparent that the defendants did not so intend. The defendants, through their counsel, repeatedly advised members of the original entity that they would be making \"comments\" on the proposed agreement. Prior to circulating the comment sheet, the defendants informed Capasso that they anticipated his \"review and comment\" thereon. Likewise, in his May 20, 2014 letter to the law firm on behalf of the defendants, Lynch indicated that \"[t]he Al Dente bid is still being considered but no decision has been made.\"\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-40\">\n   A counteroffer serves to terminate an offeree's power of acceptance.\n   <em>\n    Cavallo\n   </em>\n   v.\n   <em>\n    Lewis\n   </em>\n   , supra,\n   <extracted-citation case-ids=\"772827\" index=\"27\" url=\"https://cite.case.law/conn-app/1/519/#p521\">\n    1 Conn.App. at 521\n   </extracted-citation>\n   ,\n   <extracted-citation index=\"28\" url=\"https://cite.case.law/citations/?q=473%20A.2d%20338\">\n    473 A.2d 338\n   </extracted-citation>\n   ; 1 Restatement (Second), supra, \u00a7 39 (2).

Accordingly, the proper inquiry concerns not how Capasso perceived the comment sheet, but rather whether the defendants, through their words and acts, manifested an objective assent to surrender their power of acceptance and bind themselves to the terms of the April 14, 2014 proposed agreement, as augmented by the concerns articulated in that comment sheet. See\n   <extracted-citation case-ids=\"12488858\" index=\"40\" url=\"https://cite.case.law/a3d/152/470/#p267\">\n    id., at 267-68\n   </extracted-citation>\n   ,\n   <extracted-citation case-ids=\"12488858\" index=\"41\" url=\"https://cite.case.law/a3d/152/470/#p267\">\n    152 A.3d 470\n   </extracted-citation>\n   ; accord 1 R.

In light of the stark and informal nature of the comment sheet, its content, and the context in which it arose, it cannot reasonably be claimed that the comment sheet constituted a binding counteroffer. All of the objective evidence submitted in the present case indicates that the comment sheet was a written expression of the defendants' comments \"upon the terms of the offer\"; 1 Restatement (Second), supra, \u00a7 39, comment (b); and suggestions as to what might make the plaintiffs' proposal palatable to them. Such comments and suggestions do not constitute a counteroffer. 1 A.

Although Capasso claims to have understood the comment sheet to be a counteroffer that terminated the defendants' power of acceptance, there simply is no objective evidence in the record to indicate that the defendants shared that understanding. Accordingly, we conclude, on the basis of the pleadings, affidavits, and other proof submitted, that no triable issue of fact exists as to whether the defendants intended to so bind themselves when they circulated the comment sheet to the plaintiffs. The trial court, therefore, properly rendered summary judgment on the first count of the complaint.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-44\">\n   The judgment is affirmed.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-45\">\n   In this opinion the other judges concurred.\n  </p>\n  <footnote label=\"1\">\n   <p id=\"p-48\">\n    We recognize that Al Dente, LLC, was not formally organized until months later.

Even if we were to agree with this semantic distinction, the undisputed evidence indicates that (1) the plaintiffs commenced negotiations by submitting their April 14, 2014 proposed agreement; (2) it thereafter was-as Capasso swore in his affidavit-\"brought to [Capasso's] attention\" that certain aspects of the proposal were \"not acceptable\" to the defendants; (3) Capasso, in turn, contacted the defendants with direction to \"[p]lease strike\" those aspects from the proposal; (4) Lynch responded by informing Capasso that he would be reviewing the proposal with the defendants; (5) following that review, the defendants provided nine detailed comments on the proposal; (6) Capasso responded by creating and signing the addendum sheet and mailing it, along with a deposit check, to the defendants' representatives with the request that the defendants \"get back to us with a closing date\"; and (7) the defendants returned that check to the plaintiffs. Thus, there is no genuine issue of material fact that negotiations between the parties had occurred.\n   </p>\n  </footnote>\n  <footnote label=\"20\">\n   <p id=\"p-80\">\n    We reiterate that, in preparing the addendum sheet, Capasso titled that document \"Addendum to Contract signed 4/14/2014.\" That document describes the defendants' nine comments as \"additions to the contract signed 4/14/2014 and made a part thereof.\"\n   </p>\n  </footnote>\n  <footnote label=\"21\">\n   <p id=\"p-81\">\n    The alleged agreement that is the subject of this civil action involved the conveyance of real property known as 237 and 245 Wooster Street in New Haven. Pursuant to our statute of frauds, \"[n]o civil action may be maintained in the following cases unless the agreement, or a memorandum of the agreement, is made in writing and signed by the party, or the agent of the party, to be charged ... upon any agreement for the sale of real property or any interest in or concerning real property ....\" General Statutes \u00a7 52-550 (a) (4).\n   </p>\n  </footnote>\n </opinion>\n</casebody>\n"
