We reverse, in part, and affirm, in part, the judgment of the trial court.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-10\">\n   The jury reasonably could have found the following facts. On November 21, 2012,\n   the then three year old victim lived with her mother in an apartment in Danbury. The defendant is the victim's father, but he did not then live with the victim and mother. He was, however, a frequent visitor who occasionally spent the night in the apartment. The defendant and mother had a good relationship when the defendant was not abusing alcohol. He primarily spoke Spanish, and mother primarily spoke English, but the two devised a form of communication for themselves, a combination of English and Spanish.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-11\">\n   On the day in question, the defendant appeared at the apartment after several days of drinking. He was\n   intoxicated and asked mother for sex. Mother refused because she did not have sex with the defendant when he was drunk. That day, mother was busy preparing for the next day's Thanksgiving celebration and needed to go to the store to make a purchase. She stayed in the apartment for forty-five minutes to ensure that the defendant did not consume any additional alcohol and that he was sober enough to look after the victim. Before mother left the apartment, she gave the victim, who was in her own room, a popsicle. The defendant was sitting on the couch in the living room.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-12\">\n   When mother returned to the apartment ten minutes later, she saw the victim, with her popsicle, reclining on the couch with her pants and underwear down around her ankle and her legs wide open. The defendant was sitting a pillow's length away from the victim in a corner of the couch with his pants unbuckled. Mother asked the defendant what was going on. The defendant responded, in Spanish, that the mother did not care for him and \"chupa chapa.\"\n   <footnotemark>\n    3\n   </footnotemark>\n   Mother slapped the defendant on the face and stated that she was going to call the police. Mother called 911 and went outside with the victim to open the door for the police.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-13\">\n   When mother returned to the apartment, she saw the defendant in the bathroom and heard running water. She observed the defendant washing his penis and genital area. She stated to the defendant not to do that, but he buckled up his pants and left the apartment. According to mother, she had never before seen the defendant sponge bathing his penis; he showered like everyone else.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-14\">\n   After the police arrived, the victim and mother were transported via ambulance to the emergency room, where Krystyna Isbell, a registered nurse and sexual assault nurse examiner, administered a standardized\n   sexual assault evidence kit to the victim to collect evidence. Isbell found no signs of physical trauma to the victim and swabbed her external genitalia and vagina. The specimens collected from the victim were placed in sealed bags, transferred to a police officer, Michelle Cattuti, and delivered to the state forensic laboratory for analysis.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-15\">\n   At the state forensic laboratory, Jane Codraro, a forensic biologist, examined the material collected from the victim's vagina and external genitalia. Codraro did not find any spermatozoa, which is the cellular component of semen, but she found evidence of p30, a seminal fluid protein. A positive result for p30 indicates, but does not conclusively establish, the presence of semen. Codraro used sophisticated DNA testing to determine that the DNA extracted from the genetic material taken from the victim's vagina came from the defendant or from the same paternal lineage.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-16\">\n   Mother spoke to the defendant via telephone several weeks later when he called. Mother stated to the defendant that he\n   was not to come to the apartment until he had spoken with the Danbury Police Department. The defendant voluntarily went to the Danbury Police Department on December 5, 2012, where he was interviewed by Detective Heather Burke. The defendant gave Burke an oral statement in Spanish.\n   <footnotemark>\n    4\n   </footnotemark>\n   The defendant was arrested in January, 2013, and charged with sexual assault in the first degree in violation of \u00a7 53a-70 (a) (2), attempted sexual assault in the first degree in violation of \u00a7\u00a7 53a-49 and 53a-70 (a) (2), risk of injury to a child in violation of \u00a7 53-21 (a) (2), risk of injury to a child in violation of \u00a7 53-21 (a) (1),\n   <footnotemark>\n    5\n   </footnotemark>\n   and sexual assault in the fourth degree in violation of \u00a7 53a-73 (a) (1). Additional facts will be set forth as needed.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-17\">\n   I\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-18\">\n   DOUBLE JEOPARDY CLAIMS\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-19\">\n   The defendant has raised two double jeopardy claims on appeal: (1) his convictions for sexual assault in the first degree in violation of \u00a7 53a-70 (a) (2) and attempted sexual assault in the first degree in violation of \u00a7\u00a7 53a-49 and 53a-70 (a) (2) violated the constitutional prohibition against double jeopardy, and (2) his convictions of sexual assault in the first degree in violation of \u00a7 53a-70 (a) (2) and sexual assault in the fourth degree in violation of \u00a7 53a-73a (a) (1) (A) also violated the constitutional prohibition against double jeopardy.

In its substitute long form information filed on May 20, 2014, the state charged in count one that \"on or about November 21, 2012, at approximately 11:45 a.m. at an apartment building on Fifth Avenue in Danbury ... [the defendant] engaged in sexual intercourse with another person and such other person was under thirteen years of age and the actor was more than two years older than such other person.

[the defendant] attempted to engage in sexual intercourse with another person and such other person was under thirteen years of age and the actor was more than two years older than such other person.

The two offenses, therefore, are the same for purposes of double jeopardy.

Pursuant to the\n   <em>\n    Blockburger\n   </em>\n   test, however, we conclude that sexual assault in the first degree in violation of \u00a7 53a-70 (a) (2) and sexual assault in the fourth degree in violation of \u00a7 53a-73 (a) (1) (A) are separate and distinct crimes. Each crime requires proof of an element that the other does not. More specifically, sexual assault in the first degree requires proof of sexual intercourse, which sexual assault in the fourth degree does not; sexual assault in the fourth degree requires proof of sexual contact for the purpose of sexual gratification of the actor or the degradation or humiliation of the victim, which sexual assault in the first degree does not. Therefore, pursuant to our exercise in statutory construction, sexual assault in the fourth degree is not a lesser included offense of sexual assault in the first degree.

He continues that the legislative history shows that the intent of the\n   legislature in enacting \u00a7\u00a7 53a-70 (a) (2) and 53a-73a (a) (1) (A) was to protect persons under the age of thirteen from being sexually assaulted and that the two crimes are parallel crimes.

During voir dire, M.B. was first questioned by the defendant and then by the state. The defendant accepted M.B. as a juror, but the state exercised one of its peremptory challenges. The court excused M.B. Thereafter, defense counsel stated that M.B. was not a United States native, he was of Brazilian descent, and asked the state to articulate a race-neutral reason as to why it did not accept M.B. as a juror. Defense counsel also stated that this instance was the second time that the state had exercised a peremptory challenge with respect to a minority status individual. The prosecutor responded that her exercise of a peremptory challenge had nothing to do with M.B.'s race. \"It had to do with his being confused to some of the questions and his answers\n   to those questions,\n   <footnotemark>\n    16\n   </footnotemark>\n   and\n   that I was concerned about.... And the ability to come into judgment on another human being.\n   <footnotemark>\n    17\n   </footnotemark>\n   We had some concerns about that aspect also.\" (Footnotes added.)\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-44\">\n   The court stated its understanding of the defendant's\n   <em>\n    Batson\n   </em>\n   challenge as being related to minorities in general. The state noted that it had accepted a Hispanic male on the panel, but that it had excused a twenty-year old African American male on the basis of his youth and life experience. The court reviewed the history of jury selection in the present case with respect to the\n   manner in which the state questioned members of the venire panel, used its peremptory challenges, and whether there was a suggestion of systematic discharge of minority jurors. The court found: \"one, that the response with regard to why the state exercised a peremptory with regard to this specific juror is not pretextual, that there is in fact a basis on the record with regard to the questions that were asked and the responses. The court will additionally find that, after looking back at the selection process in total, that there is no systematic exclusion of minority jurors. I do agree that there are minorities on this jury.... The state has only used [inaudible] peremptory challenges in total, and so this court is making a finding that there is no, in this court's opinion, systematic excuse with regard to minorities and that the reason given for the excuse [of M.B.] in particular is race-neutral.\"\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-45\">\n   On appeal, the defendant argues that the record does not support that state's reasons for exercising a peremptory challenge with regard to M.B. and that the court erred in finding that the state did not act in a purposefully discriminatory manner in selecting the jury. We are unpersuaded. Although the defendant acknowledges that English may not be\n   M.B.'s first language and that M.B. was not particularly articulate, he claims that the record does not reveal that M.B. did not understand the questions put to him. We disagree with the defendant's claim that the state's reasons for exercising a peremptory challenge with respect to M.B. was pretextual, as we conclude that the reasons given for excusing M.B. were race neutral, were supported by the record, and were appropriate.

On April 10, 2014, the defendant filed a request that the state disclose all of mother's medical records, particularly her mental health records, on the ground that they were exculpatory and necessary for cross-examination of her. In response, the prosecutor issued a subpoena to the Department of Mental Health and Addiction Services, Western Connecticut Mental Health Network. In response to the subpoena, an assistant attorney general filed a motion to quash the subpoena.\n   <footnotemark>\n    20\n   </footnotemark>\n   The prosecutor also objected to the disclosure of mother's mental health records. The court held a hearing on the motion to quash on April 30, 2014, and denied the motion to quash but ordered that the subject records be delivered to the clerk's office under seal. The court ordered that neither party was to receive copies of the documents.\n   <footnotemark>\n    21\n   </footnotemark>\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-61\">\n   The court held a hearing pursuant to\n   <em>\n    State\n   </em>\n   v.\n   <em>\n    Esposito\n   </em>\n   , supra,\n   <extracted-citation case-ids=\"684573\" index=\"98\" url=\"https://cite.case.law/conn/192/166/#p179\">\n    192 Conn. 166\n   </extracted-citation>\n   ,\n   <extracted-citation index=\"99\" url=\"https://cite.case.law/citations/?q=471%20A.2d%20949\">\n    471 A.2d 949\n   </extracted-citation>\n   , on May 6, 2014. At the hearing, the defendant represented to the court that he was aware that mother has received considerable mental health services and has been treated for substance abuse \"that may have an impact on her ability to perceive, recall, and disclose, all of which goes to a proper examination of this witness.\" More particularly, the defendant represented that mother suffers from schizophrenia and may or may not take medication that affects her ability to perceive, recall, and adequately report. The state objected to the disclosure of mother's medical records, arguing that the defendant had not made the requisite showing that mother's credibility, or her ability to perceive or recall was at issue. The court stated that\n   the case law is clear that drug use goes to the ability to recall and relate information accurately to the jury. It, therefore, concluded that there is potential for this information to be imperative for the defendant in terms of cross-examination, but tended to disagree with the defendant that a ten year period of time was appropriate, noting that for the court to disclose the medical records, the records must relate to the specifics of mother's ability to testify, her ability to recall or comprehend what she is recollecting in terms of what occurred during the time period relating to the underlying incident. The court also stated that it could not conduct an in camera review unless mother agreed to it. Mother subsequently agreed to the court's in camera review of her medical records and to the disclosure of her records that the court thought relevant to the defendant's cross-examination of her.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-62\">\n   The court stated on the record: \"Having looked at everything, I will also say this for the record, that what is being handed over, while it may seem like it's a lot, and it certainly is a lot. It is to a large extent duplicative in that it's the continued diagnosis from one date to the next, which isn't necessarily saying something different but is continuing to address the same diagnosis. So, to a large extent, the documents duplicate each other in what they are providing to counsel.\"\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-63\">\n   On appeal, the defendant has asked this court to review mother's medical records to determine if there are other documents that are probative of her ability to comprehend, recall, and accurately convey the truth. He argues that the documents disclosed by the trial court, following its in camera review, suggest that there might be additional documents that should have been disclosed. The state agreed that this court should conduct an in camera review of mother's medical records to determine whether the trial court abused its discretion by not providing the defendant access to more of\n   mother's medical records. Following a lengthy in camera review of the subject records, we agree that many of the records are duplicative and find that the court did not abuse is discretion by limiting the records to be disclosed to the defendant. In fact, we commend the court for the manner in which it, with the agreement of counsel, disclosed summaries of mother's medical record history, which the trial court stated gave a better account and a flavor of the full history and diagnosis of mother. We, therefore, conclude that the defendant's right to cross-examine mother was not violated and his claim as to the disclosure of mother's medical records fails.\n   <footnotemark>\n    22\n   </footnotemark>\n   As set forth in part I A of this opinion, the defendant's conviction of attempt to commit sexual assault in the first degree must be vacated and the defendant\n   must be resentenced by the trial court.\n   <footnotemark>\n    23\n   </footnotemark>\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-64\">\n   The judgment with respect to the defendant's conviction of attempt to commit sexual assault in the first degree is reversed and the case is remanded with direction to vacate that conviction and to resentence the defendant consistent with this opinion. The judgment is affirmed in all other respects.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-65\">\n   In this opinion the other judges concurred.\n  </p>\n  <footnote label=\"1\">\n   <p id=\"p-69\">\n    The court sentenced the defendant on count one, sexual assault in the first degree, to twenty-five years in the custody of the Commissioner of Correction, suspended after ten years and twenty-five years of probation, and lifetime sex offender registration. As to count two, attempted sexual assault in the first degree, the court sentenced the defendant to ten years in prison concurrent with the sentence on count one. As to count three, risk of injury to a child, the defendant was sentenced to prison for twenty years, execution suspended after ten years, the sentence to be concurrent with the sentence on count two but consecutive to count one. With regard to count five, sexual assault in the fourth degree, the defendant was sentenced to five years, concurrent with the sentence on count two, but consecutive to counts one and three. The defendant's total effective sentence is forty-five years, execution suspended after twenty-five years with twenty-five years of probation.\n   </p>\n   <p id=\"p-70\">\n    The state contends that there is a mathematical error in the court's calculation of the total effective sentence, arguing that it is fifty rather than forty-five years. Any mathematical or clerical error is to be corrected at the time the defendant is resentenced.\n   </p>\n  </footnote>\n  <footnote label=\"2\">\n   <p id=\"p-71\">\n    See\n    <em>\n     Batson\n    </em>\n    v.\n    <em>\n     Kentucky\n    </em>\n    ,\n    <extracted-citation case-ids=\"12787\" index=\"100\" url=\"https://cite.case.law/us/476/79/\">\n     476 U.S. 79\n    </extracted-citation>\n    , 89,\n    <extracted-citation case-ids=\"12787\" index=\"101\" url=\"https://cite.case.law/us/476/79/\">\n     106 S.Ct. 1712\n    </extracted-citation>\n    ,\n    <extracted-citation case-ids=\"12787\" index=\"102\" url=\"https://cite.case.law/us/476/79/\">\n     90 L.Ed.2d 69\n    </extracted-citation>\n    (1986).\n   </p>\n  </footnote>\n  <footnote label=\"3\">\n   <p id=\"p-72\">\n    Mother understood \"chupa chapa\" to mean \"suck vagina.\"\n   </p>\n  </footnote>\n  <footnote label=\"4\">\n   <p id=\"p-73\">\n    The English translation of the defendant's statement is as follows: \"I went to [mother's] house.
