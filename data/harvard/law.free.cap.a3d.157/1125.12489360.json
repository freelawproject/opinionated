Although Justice Palmer was not present when the case was argued before the court, he has read the briefs and appendices, and listened to a recording of the oral argument prior to participating in this decision.\n  </p>\n </footnote>\n <opinion type=\"majority\">\n  <author id=\"p-8\">\n   VERTEFEUILLE, J.\n  </author>\n  <p id=\"p-9\">\n   The dispositive question presented by this appeal is whether a prevailing party in\n   a civil action can enforce an unpaid award of costs through a motion for civil contempt rather than by pursuing the various postjudgment remedies authorized\n   by chapter 906 of the General Statutes. We conclude that, under ordinary circumstances, such as those in this case, the court's inherent contempt power is not an appropriate means of enforcing an award of costs or other monetary judgment. We therefore affirm the judgment of the trial court denying the motion of the named defendant, The Charlotte Hungerford Hospital, to hold the plaintiff, Robert Pease, in contempt of court.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-10\">\n   The following procedural history is relevant to our disposition of this appeal. The plaintiff brought an action against the defendants, the hospital and one of its employees, Kateri D. Veillette, a registered nurse, for personal injuries allegedly sustained as a result of medical malpractice.\n   <footnotemark>\n    1\n   </footnotemark>\n   The case was tried to a jury, which returned a verdict in favor of the hospital, and the trial court,\n   <em>\n    Pickard, J.\n   </em>\n   , rendered judgment in accordance with the verdict. The hospital then filed a bill of costs and, following the court clerk's approval of the bill, the plaintiff sought review by the trial court. See Practice Book \u00a7 18-5(b). The trial court ultimately awarded the hospital $5965 in expert fees and other costs.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-11\">\n   Approximately five months later, the hospital filed a motion to hold the plaintiff in contempt of court. Claiming that the award of costs was a court order, and thus amenable to contempt, the hospital alleged that the plaintiff had not paid any of the awarded costs and speculated that the plaintiff had the ability to comply with the order,\n   <footnotemark>\n    2\n   </footnotemark>\n   but simply refused to do so. By way of initial remedy, the hospital requested that the court issue a written order that the plaintiff must pay $5965\n   in accordance with the court's taxation of costs by some date certain. The hospital did not and does not contend that, prior to moving for contempt, it pursued any of the postjudgment remedies that our legislature has authorized under chapter 906 of the General Statutes, including executing the award of costs; see General Statutes \u00a7\u00a7 52-356a and 52-361a ; placing a judgment lien on the plaintiff's real or personal property; see General Statutes \u00a7\u00a7 52-355a and 52-380a ; and examining the plaintiff as a judgment debtor or engaging in other forms of postjudgment discovery. See General Statutes \u00a7\u00a7 52-351b and 5-397.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-12\">\n   Following a hearing, the court denied the hospital's motion for contempt. In its order, the court \"agree[d] with the plaintiff that an award of costs to the prevailing party following a jury trial is not an order that should be enforced with the contempt power\" and \"suggest[ed] that the [hospital] consult the normal methods of enforcing a judgment in General Statutes chapter 906 or the possibility of a suit on the debt ....\" The court also declined to issue an order requiring that the plaintiff pay the costs by a definite date.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-13\">\n   The hospital appealed to the Appellate Court, contending that the trial court improperly concluded, as a matter of law, that it lacked the inherent authority to coerce compliance with an award of costs. We transferred the appeal to this court pursuant to General Statutes \u00a7 51-199(c) and Practice Book \u00a7 65-1. Prior to oral\n   argument, this court, sua sponte, asked the parties to address the jurisdictional question of whether the denial of the motion for contempt was an appealable final judgment. Additional facts will be set forth as necessary.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-14\">\n   I\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-15\">\n   At the outset, we must determine whether the trial court's denial of a postjudgment motion for contempt\n   is an appealable final judgment. See\n   <em>\n    State\n   </em>\n   v.\n   <em>\n    Johnson\n   </em>\n   ,\n   <extracted-citation case-ids=\"6775842\" index=\"0\" url=\"https://cite.case.law/conn/301/630/#p640\">\n    301 Conn. 630\n   </extracted-citation>\n   , 640,\n   <extracted-citation index=\"1\" url=\"https://cite.case.law/citations/?q=26%20A.3d%2059\">\n    26 A.3d 59\n   </extracted-citation>\n   (2011). The hospital contends that it is. The plaintiff disagrees, arguing that the present appeal should be governed by the jurisdictional test that we apply to interlocutory orders under\n   <em>\n    State\n   </em>\n   v.\n   <em>\n    Curcio\n   </em>\n   ,\n   <extracted-citation case-ids=\"682753\" index=\"2\" url=\"https://cite.case.law/conn/191/27/\">\n    191 Conn. 27\n   </extracted-citation>\n   ,\n   <extracted-citation index=\"3\" url=\"https://cite.case.law/citations/?q=463%20A.2d%20566\">\n    463 A.2d 566\n   </extracted-citation>\n   (1983), and that the denial of a motion for contempt does not satisfy either prong of the\n   <em>\n    Curcio\n   </em>\n   test-it neither terminates a separate and distinct proceeding nor so concludes the rights of the parties that further proceedings cannot affect them. We agree with the hospital that the denial of a postjudgment motion for civil contempt constitutes an appealable final judgment.\n   <footnotemark>\n    3\n   </footnotemark>\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-16\">\n   Although neither party cites to it, our decision most directly on point is\n   <em>\n    Potter\n   </em>\n   v.\n   <em>\n    Board of Selectmen\n   </em>\n   ,\n   <extracted-citation case-ids=\"672652\" index=\"4\" url=\"https://cite.case.law/conn/174/195/\">\n    174 Conn. 195\n   </extracted-citation>\n   ,\n   <extracted-citation index=\"5\" url=\"https://cite.case.law/citations/?q=384%20A.2d%20369\">\n    384 A.2d 369\n   </extracted-citation>\n   (1978). In\n   <em>\n    Potter\n   </em>\n   , this court had held in a prior proceeding that the plaintiff was improperly denied a permit to operate a mobile home park.

Subsequently, the defendant town denied the plaintiff the necessary building and health permits relating to the project and he sought a contempt order.\n   <extracted-citation index=\"7\" url=\"https://cite.case.law/citations/?q=384%20A.2d%20369\">\n    Id.\n   </extracted-citation>\n   On appeal, we reviewed the trial court's denial of a finding of contempt on the merits, noting that such determinations are final adjudications that are within our power to review.

We did so despite\n   the fact that the plaintiff had not exhausted his available remedies and could have pursued independent administrative appeals from the denial of his requests for the permits in question. See\n   <extracted-citation index=\"9\" url=\"https://cite.case.law/citations/?q=384%20A.2d%20369\">\n    id.,\n   </extracted-citation>\n   at 199 n.2,\n   <extracted-citation index=\"10\" url=\"https://cite.case.law/citations/?q=384%20A.2d%20369\">\n    384 A.2d 369\n   </extracted-citation>\n   . Although\n   <em>\n    Potter\n   </em>\n   came to us in a unique procedural posture, we have since cited the case for the general proposition that denial of a postjudgment motion for contempt is a final judgment subject to appellate review. See\n   <em>\n    Pritchard\n   </em>\n   v.\n   <em>\n    Pritchard\n   </em>\n   ,\n   <extracted-citation case-ids=\"3950716\" index=\"11\" url=\"https://cite.case.law/conn/281/262/#p272\">\n    281 Conn. 262\n   </extracted-citation>\n   , 272-73,\n   <extracted-citation index=\"12\" url=\"https://cite.case.law/citations/?q=914%20A.2d%201025\">\n    914 A.2d 1025\n   </extracted-citation>\n   (2007). The Appellate Court also has read\n   <em>\n    Potter\n   </em>\n   broadly for the conclusion that \"the denial of a motion for contempt is a final judgment for purposes of appeal ....\"\n   <footnotemark>\n    4\n   </footnotemark>\n   <em>\n    Willocks\n   </em>\n   v.\n   <em>\n    Klein\n   </em>\n   ,\n   <extracted-citation case-ids=\"736509\" index=\"13\" url=\"https://cite.case.law/conn-app/38/317/#p320\">\n    38 Conn.App. 317\n   </extracted-citation>\n   , 320,\n   <extracted-citation index=\"14\" url=\"https://cite.case.law/citations/?q=660%20A.2d%20869\">\n    660 A.2d 869\n   </extracted-citation>\n   (1995) ; see\n   <em>\n    Johnson\n   </em>\n   v.\n   <em>\n    Clark\n   </em>\n   ,\n   <extracted-citation case-ids=\"3709017\" index=\"15\" url=\"https://cite.case.law/conn-app/113/611/#p617\">\n    113 Conn.App. 611\n   </extracted-citation>\n   , 617,\n   <extracted-citation index=\"16\" url=\"https://cite.case.law/citations/?q=967%20A.2d%201222\">\n    967 A.2d 1222\n   </extracted-citation>\n   (2009) (same).\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-17\">\n   Moreover, to the extent that the\n   <em>\n    Curcio\n   </em>\n   test, which governs interlocutory appeals, applies to the present case, we disagree with the plaintiff's contention that the first prong of that test is not satisfied. Our\n   <em>\n    Curcio\n   </em>\n   jurisprudence is animated by the principle that parties should not repeatedly interrupt ongoing litigation to conduct piecemeal appeals, especially when they will have the opportunity to challenge all pertinent rulings after the litigation culminates in a final judgment. See\n   <em>\n    Melia\n   </em>\n   v.\n   <em>\n    Hartford Fire Ins.

Here, however, both the underlying litigation and the ancillary contempt proceedings have terminated.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-18\">\n   There is no ongoing proceeding or litigation the completion of which the parties must await, and we do not see any different termination point at which an appeal will be more appropriate. Accordingly, aside from certain exceptions not relevant to the present appeal, a completed contempt hearing generally has been treated as a separate and distinct proceeding for\n   <em>\n    Curcio\n   </em>\n   purposes.

The hospital's argument proceeds in three steps. First, the hospital posits that the court decided, as a matter of law, that it lacked the inherent authority to coerce the plaintiff to comply with the award of costs and, therefore, declined to conduct a factual determination as to whether the plaintiff was in contempt. Second, the hospital contends that a trial court does in fact possess the inherent authority to use its contempt\n   power to compel compliance with an order taxing costs. Third, the hospital argues that a judgment creditor may seek to enforce a monetary judgment or taxation of costs through a motion for contempt without first pursuing the various postjudgment remedies afforded by chapter 906, and that it is not an abuse of the court's discretion to enforce such a judgment or award via contempt even if the statutory remedies have not been exhausted. The plaintiff, by contrast, contends that the trial court properly recognized that contempt is a \"drastic\" remedy;\n   <em>\n    Woodbury Knoll, LLC\n   </em>\n   v.\n   <em>\n    Shipman &amp; Goodwin, LLP\n   </em>\n   ,\n   <extracted-citation index=\"29\" url=\"https://cite.case.law/citations/?q=305%20Conn.%20750\">\n    305 Conn. 750\n   </extracted-citation>\n   , 766 n.12,\n   <extracted-citation index=\"30\" url=\"https://cite.case.law/citations/?q=48%20A.3d%2016\">\n    48 A.3d 16\n   </extracted-citation>\n   (2012) ; that,\n   under normal circumstances, should not be used to enforce a routine monetary judgment or award of costs in lieu of the statutory collection procedures.\n   <footnotemark>\n    5\n   </footnotemark>\n   We agree with the plaintiff.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-21\">\n   The standard by which we review a trial court's denial of a motion for civil contempt hinges on the rationale for the court's ruling. To the extent that the trial court concluded as a matter of law that it lacked the authority to find the plaintiff in contempt, our review is plenary.\n   <footnotemark>\n    6\n   </footnotemark>\n   See\n   <em>\n    AvalonBay Communities, Inc\n   </em>\n   . v.\n   <em>\n    Plan &amp; Zoning Commission\n   </em>\n   ,\n   <extracted-citation case-ids=\"832000\" index=\"31\" url=\"https://cite.case.law/conn/260/232/#p239\">\n    260 Conn. 232\n   </extracted-citation>\n   , 239-40,\n   <extracted-citation index=\"32\" url=\"https://cite.case.law/citations/?q=796%20A.2d%201164\">\n    796 A.2d 1164\n   </extracted-citation>\n   (2002).\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-22\">\n   Whether and under what circumstances a prevailing party may enforce an award of costs by a motion for contempt are questions of first impression for this court.

Justice Shea explained that \"[t]he practice of imprisonment for ordinary debts was abandoned long ago and it defies credulity to assume that the court ... in entering the order that is the basis for the finding of contempt intended that the plaintiff's noncompliance might result in her incarceration or other punishment for contempt.

The hospital has failed to articulate any reason why those remedies are inadequate to address its claim for payment.\n   <footnotemark>\n    14\n   </footnotemark>\n   Accordingly, we see no reason why Connecticut should diverge from the majority rule that, outside of the marital dissolution and child support context, ordinary monetary judgments and taxations of costs are not subject to enforcement by civil contempt absent extraordinary circumstances. Insofar as the hospital failed to allege any extraordinary circumstances that might justify a departure from the general rule,\n   <footnotemark>\n    15\n   </footnotemark>\n   we conclude, as a matter of law, that the trial court properly denied the motion for contempt without first determining whether the plaintiff's failure to pay was wilful.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-34\">\n   The judgment is affirmed.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-35\">\n   In this opinion the other justices concurred.\n  </p>\n  <footnote label=\"1\">\n   <p id=\"p-39\">\n    The plaintiff later withdrew his claim against Veillette, leaving the hospital as the sole remaining defendant.\n   </p>\n  </footnote>\n  <footnote label=\"2\">\n   <p id=\"p-40\">\n    The parties disagree as to whether the award of costs constituted an order of the court.

We assume without deciding that: (1) the contempt proceedings encompassed by \u00a7 52-400d are limited to those expressly authorized in chapter 906; see, e.g., General Statutes \u00a7\u00a7 52-399 and 52-400b ; (2) a finding of contempt, pursuant to the court's common-law authority as recognized in Practice Book \u00a7 1-21A, for failure to pay costs would not constitute a \"compliance order\" for purposes of chapter 906; see General Statutes \u00a7 52-350a(15) (defining \"[p]ostjudgment procedure[s]\"); and, therefore, (3) \u00a7 52-400d does not confer appellate jurisdiction under the present circumstances.
