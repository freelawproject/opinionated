On appeal, the state claims that the Appellate Court improperly concluded that: (1) the defendant was entitled to a judgment of acquittal with respect to the racketeering conviction because the two predicate acts of racketeering, identified by the jury pursuant to\n   \u00a7 53-396 (b), did not constitute sufficient evidence of an enterprise; and (2) a new trial was required for the remaining offenses because the denial of a continuance effectively deprived the defendant of his right of self-representation. With respect to the racketeering conviction, we conclude that the Appellate Court improperly circumscribed its sufficiency of the evidence analysis by limiting it to the two predicate\n   acts, but nevertheless properly determined that there was insufficient evidence to support the racketeering conviction. With respect to the other convictions, we conclude that the Appellate Court improperly determined that the denial of a continuance effectively deprived the defendant of his right of self-representation. Accordingly, we affirm in part and reverse in part the judgment of the Appellate Court.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-11\">\n   The record and the opinion of the Appellate Court set forth the following background facts and procedural history. \"The charges upon which the defendant was brought to trial were all based upon his alleged involvement in seven separate sales of cocaine to a police informant, David Hannon, during an undercover police investigation of illegal drug activity in the area of Pembroke and Ogden Streets in Bridgeport between late June through early November, 2010.\" Id., at 259,\n   <extracted-citation index=\"5\" url=\"https://cite.case.law/citations/?q=112%20A.3d%20834\">\n    112 A.3d 834\n   </extracted-citation>\n   . As will be discussed more fully in part I B of this opinion, during that time period, the investigating task force of officers from the Bridgeport Police Department and the Connecticut State Police obtained extensive audiotape and videotape surveillance footage of these sales, in which the defendant, working from the porch of his duplex home, which directly abutted the sidewalk on Pembroke Street, sold cocaine to Hannon, or facilitated sales to Hannon by six other drug dealers, namely, David Moreland, Jason Ortiz, Willie Brazil, Raymond Mathis, Carlos Lopez, and Kenneth Jamison.\n   <footnotemark>\n    4\n   </footnotemark>\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-12\">\n   \"In an amended long form information dated January 3, 2012, the state charged the defendant, more particularly,\n   with: one count each of sale of narcotics by a person who is not drug-dependent and sale of narcotics within 1500 feet of a school by a person who is not drug-dependent in connection with each such alleged sale; and one count each of conspiracy to sell narcotics and racketeering based upon his alleged involvement in all seven such alleged sales, as specially pleaded both in the conspiracy count, as overt acts in furtherance of the alleged conspiracy, and in the racketeering count, as incidents of racketeering activity claimed to prove his involvement in a pattern of racketeering activity, as required by ... \u00a7 53-396 (a).

It found him not guilty, however, of all charges based upon the alleged sale of drugs to Hannon on June 25, 2010, the first date specified in the information. The jury also found the defendant guilty of both conspiracy\n   to sell narcotics and racketeering, specifying as to the latter charge, in a special verdict returned pursuant to \u00a7 53-396 (b), that the sole basis for its finding that the defendant had engaged in a pattern of racketeering activity as a member of an enterprise was his involvement in the sale of cocaine on two of the seven dates specified in the information, June 30 and November 9, 2010, which it found to have constituted 'incidents of racketeering activity.'

Specifically, the Appellate Court first concluded that the defendant was entitled to a judgment of acquittal on the racketeering charge on the ground that \"there was insufficient evidence to support his racketeering conviction because the state failed to prove either the existence of an enterprise formed for the common purpose of selling narcotics or that he was associated with such an enterprise.\" Id., at 265,\n   <extracted-citation index=\"8\" url=\"https://cite.case.law/citations/?q=112%20A.3d%20834\">\n    112 A.3d 834\n   </extracted-citation>\n   .

The record sets forth the following additional relevant facts and procedural history. Although the jury\n   convicted the defendant of a total of six cocaine sales to Hannon that took place between the dates of June 30 and November 9, 2010, the Appellate Court noted that the special verdict form, rendered pursuant to \u00a7 53-396 (b), indicated that the \"defendant's racketeering conviction was expressly predicated\" on the two cocaine sales that occurred on June 30 and November 9, 2010.\n   <footnotemark>\n    6\n   </footnotemark>\n   <em>\n    State\n   </em>\n   v.\n   <em>\n    Bush\n   </em>\n   , supra,\n   <extracted-citation index=\"10\" url=\"https://cite.case.law/citations/?q=156%20Conn.%20App.%20256\">\n    156 Conn.App. at 263\n   </extracted-citation>\n   ,\n   <extracted-citation index=\"11\" url=\"https://cite.case.law/citations/?q=112%20A.3d%20834\">\n    112 A.3d 834\n   </extracted-citation>\n   .

Ortiz at the defendant's home on Pembroke Street in Bridgeport. To that end, Hannon telephoned Ortiz before arriving at the defendant's home, and also telephoned the defendant's home phone number. Prior to Hannon's arrival at the defendant's\n   home, Ortiz, who was then under surveillance by other members of the task force, went to the rear of the home, then returned to the front porch with a small blue bag in his hand, which he later put in his mouth.\n   <footnotemark>\n    7\n   </footnotemark>\n   When Hannon arrived at the defendant's home, the defendant emerged from his backyard, walked past Hannon's vehicle while looking inside it, then continued to the street corner, where he gestured to Ortiz by raising his hand in the air. Ortiz then approached Hannon's vehicle and opened the door, whereupon the defendant came up behind Ortiz, reached inside the vehicle, and tapped hands with Hannon. Hannon gave Ortiz money, in exchange for which Ortiz gave Hannon the blue bag of cocaine that had been in his mouth. Meanwhile, another man approached the defendant. After completing the transaction with Hannon, when the defendant gestured ... once again, [and] Ortiz handed something to the other man in exchange for money.

When Hannon arrived at the defendant's home, the defendant was standing on the street corner with ... Brazil. The defendant got into Hannon's vehicle, and he and Hannon drove off. During their ride, the defendant made a phone call in an apparent attempt to procure cocaine, which Hannon had requested. After the call, Hannon and the defendant\n   drove back to the defendant's home. On the way back, Hannon told the defendant that he also\n   wanted to buy a gun, which the defendant said was 'doable.' When they returned, Hannon dropped off the defendant to speak to Brazil, then pulled around the corner onto Pembroke Street, as the defendant had directed. Once he did so ...

App. 2012), the defendant contends that the special verdict established key material facts, namely, that the only incidents of racketeering activity that occurred were the two sales considered by the Appellate Court. Put differently, the defendant contends that the jury's failure to find in its special verdict that the other five sales constituted \"racketeering activity\" operated as an acquittal, particularly insofar as the jury also found the defendant drug-dependent and acting by himself in four of the proven sales. The defendant further argues that, even if the entire record is considered, the present case\n   is distinguishable from numerous reported federal racketeering decisions sustaining findings of an association in fact enterprise because the present case lacks even informal organizational hallmarks. The defendant contends, specifically, that the present case lacks evidence of the following: (1) of a single source for the drugs sold; (2) of sharing of weapons or profits; (3) of specific job functions; and (4) that the cocaine sold in this case came from inside the defendant's home. Finally, the defendant contends that, even if an enterprise existed among the other six dealers, there was insufficient evidence that he had associated with that enterprise. Although we agree with the state that the Appellate Court improperly circumscribed its inquiry in determining whether there was sufficient evidence of an enterprise, we nevertheless agree with the defendant that the Appellate Court properly determined that there was insufficient evidence to sustain the defendant's racketeering conviction.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-19\">\n   \"The standard of review we apply to a claim of insufficient evidence is well established. In reviewing the sufficiency of the evidence to support a criminal conviction we apply a two-part test. First, we construe the evidence in the light most favorable to sustaining the verdict. Second, we determine whether upon the facts so construed and the inferences reasonably drawn therefrom the [finder of fact] reasonably could have concluded that the cumulative\n   force of the evidence established guilt beyond a reasonable doubt....\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-20\">\n   \"We note that the jury must find every element proven beyond a reasonable doubt in order to find the defendant guilty of the charged offense, [but] each of the basic and inferred facts underlying those conclusions need not be proved beyond a reasonable doubt.... If it is reasonable and logical for the jury to conclude that a basic fact or an inferred fact is true, the jury is permitted to consider the fact proven and may consider\n   it in combination with other proven facts in determining whether the cumulative effect of all the evidence proves the defendant guilty of all the elements of the crime charged beyond a reasonable doubt....\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-21\">\n   \"Moreover, it does not diminish the probative force of the evidence that it consists, in whole or in part, of evidence that is circumstantial rather than direct.... It is not one fact, but the cumulative impact of a multitude of facts which establishes guilt in a case involving substantial circumstantial evidence....

Whether CORA, and, particularly, the special verdict provision of \u00a7 53-396 (b), requires that the jury's finding as to the existence of an enterprise to be based solely on the evidence concerning the predicate acts specified in the special verdict presents a question of statutory interpretation over which we exercise plenary review.

In particular, we focus on \u00a7 53-396 (b), which requires a special verdict, because that is the subsection that led the Appellate Court to confine its sufficiency analysis in the present case to the incidents of racketeering activity that the jury found to have occurred on June 30 and November 9, 2010. See\n   <em>\n    State\n   </em>\n   v.\n   <em>\n    Bush\n   </em>\n   , supra,\n   <extracted-citation index=\"42\" url=\"https://cite.case.law/citations/?q=156%20Conn.%20App.%20256\">\n    156 Conn.App. at 263\n   </extracted-citation>\n   ,\n   <extracted-citation index=\"43\" url=\"https://cite.case.law/citations/?q=112%20A.3d%20834\">\n    112 A.3d 834\n   </extracted-citation>\n   .

This is particularly evident when subsection (b) is read in context with subsection (a) of \u00a7 53-396, which governs the pleading of a racketeering claim under CORA. Section 53-396 (a) is silent with respect to enterprise, and only requires the state to allege specifically \"the existence of a pattern of racketeering activity based upon at least two incidents of racketeering activity, which shall be specified in such information ....\" Tellingly, \u00a7 53-396 (a) expressly contemplates that the fact finder may well be exposed to evidence of other criminal activities during a prosecution for racketeering, as it specifically authorizes the state, \"where otherwise permitted by law, [to] individually charge in separate counts of the same information or by indictment any offense notwithstanding that such offense may also constitute an incident\n   of racketeering activity specified in the count charging a violation of this chapter.\" Read in context, the fact that neither subsections (a) nor (b) of \u00a7 53-396 mandate special pleading and proof of the enterprise element and specifically contemplate exposure to other aspects of criminal activity during the trial suggests that the legislature did not intend to otherwise limit the proof of the enterprise element solely to that evidence used to prove the predicate incidents of racketeering activity.

We begin our review of the evidence with the June 25, 2010 transaction.\n   <footnotemark>\n    18\n   </footnotemark>\n   Specifically, Hannon went to the corner of Pembroke and Ogden Streets intending to make a controlled narcotics purchase from the defendant. Prior to Hannon's arrival, Detective Jason Amato had observed the defendant standing in front of his house with Moreland and Mathis and then observed the defendant leaving the area. After Hannon arrived, Moreland informed him that the defendant had gone to the police station to seek victims' compensation for injuries he had sustained in a shooting. Hannon purchased cocaine from Moreland, who had returned to the porch of the defendant's home to obtain it from Mathis. A review of the videotape evidence demonstrates that the porch of the defendant's home, and its short set of access steps, directly abutted the sidewalk on Pembroke Street.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-32\">\n   With respect to the June 30, 2010 sale, which the jury found to be one of the two predicate acts in the pattern of racketeering,\n   Hannon called Ortiz, an \"associate\" of the defendant on Ortiz' mobile phone, looking to\n   purchase drugs. While Hannon was on his way to the corner of Pembroke and Ogden, the defendant called Hannon to ask why he had not yet arrived. When Hannon arrived at that location, he called the defendant to indicate his arrival. Once Hannon arrived at the defendant's home, the defendant gestured to Ortiz and the two of them made the sale to Hannon as described by the Appellate Court. See\n   <em>\n    State\n   </em>\n   v.\n   <em>\n    Bush\n   </em>\n   , supra,\n   <extracted-citation index=\"85\" url=\"https://cite.case.law/citations/?q=156%20Conn.%20App.%20256\">\n    156 Conn.App. at 263-64\n   </extracted-citation>\n   ,\n   <extracted-citation index=\"86\" url=\"https://cite.case.law/citations/?q=112%20A.3d%20834\">\n    112 A.3d 834\n   </extracted-citation>\n   .\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-33\">\n   The state also relied on evidence from sales on August 6, 2010, and August 24, 2010. In particular, the August 24, 2010 sale was precipitated by a telephone call from Hannon to the defendant's home phone number, which the defendant had given to Hannon after selling him cocaine on August 6. To complete the August 24, 2010 sale to Hannon, the defendant obtained cocaine from Lopez on his front porch.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-34\">\n   Finally, we review the November 9, 2010 sale, which the jury found to be the second predicate act of racketeering. First, Hannon set up the purchase by calling the defendant on the mobile phone number that he previously had used to contact Ortiz,\n   <footnotemark>\n    19\n   </footnotemark>\n   to let him know that he was on the way to meet him. The remainder of the transaction took place as described by the Appellate Court, including the fact that the defendant, upon learning of Hannon's desire to purchase cocaine, called Moreland to obtain the cocaine. The defendant took Hannon's money, and Moreland himself delivered the cocaine to Hannon on Pembroke Street. The defendant later contacted Hannon to confirm that the delivery had occurred, and discussed further Hannon's stated interest in having the defendant help him purchase a gun. See id., at 264-65,\n   <extracted-citation index=\"87\" url=\"https://cite.case.law/citations/?q=112%20A.3d%20834\">\n    112 A.3d 834\n   </extracted-citation>\n   .\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-35\">\n   We conclude that this evidence was insufficient to prove the association in fact necessary to establish an\n   enterprise for purposes of CORA. Even accepting that the individuals involved shared a common purpose of selling drugs on the eastern side of Bridgeport, there is no evidence that they functioned as a continuing unit or even an informal organization. See\n   <em>\n    State\n   </em>\n   v.\n   <em>\n    Rodriguez-Roman\n   </em>\n   , supra,\n   <extracted-citation case-ids=\"4088232\" index=\"88\" url=\"https://cite.case.law/conn/297/66/#p82\">\n    297 Conn. at 82\n   </extracted-citation>\n   ,\n   <extracted-citation index=\"89\" url=\"https://cite.case.law/citations/?q=3%20A.3d%20783\">\n    3 A.3d 783\n   </extracted-citation>\n   . Although the evidence demonstrated that the individuals the defendant permitted to deal drugs from his porch were by no means strangers to him, it does not establish the requisite relationships necessary to sustain a finding of an enterprise. Indeed, it is well short of the evidence that two United States Courts of Appeal have characterized as minimally sufficient to establish the existence of an association in fact under RICO. For example, in\n   <em>\n    United States\n   </em>\n   v.\n   <em>\n    Nascimento\n   </em>\n   ,\n   <extracted-citation case-ids=\"3468711\" index=\"90\" url=\"https://cite.case.law/f3d/491/25/#p33\">\n    491 F.3d 25\n   </extracted-citation>\n   , 33 (1st Cir. 2007), cert. denied,\n   <extracted-citation index=\"91\" url=\"https://cite.case.law/citations/?q=552%20U.S.%201297\">\n    552 U.S. 1297\n   </extracted-citation>\n   ,\n   <extracted-citation index=\"92\" url=\"https://cite.case.law/citations/?q=128%20S.%20Ct.%201738\">\n    128 S.Ct. 1738\n   </extracted-citation>\n   ,\n   <extracted-citation index=\"93\" url=\"https://cite.case.law/citations/?q=170%20L.%20Ed.%202d%20543\">\n    170 L.Ed.2d 543\n   </extracted-citation>\n   (2008), the First Circuit deemed the evidence \"barely\" enough to prove that a street gang constituted a RICO enterprise. Although the defendants in\n   <em>\n    Nascimento\n   </em>\n   relied on the testimony of \"cooperating witnesses who described [the gang] as a loose aggregation of friends that lacked colors, initiation rites, and a formal hierarchy,\" the court emphasized that other testimony supported the jury's verdict that the group was an enterprise, including \"a shared cache of firearms that were regarded as property of the gang,\" and used to shoot rivals. Id., at 32-33. The court also cited testimony demonstrating that members of the group \"self-identified\" as being\n   part of the gang, \"displayed an ability to distinguish between members and friends,\" trained each other \"in the use of night vision goggles, binoculars, and police evasion tactics to enable them more efficiently to carry out their shared purpose of killing [rival group] members,\" \"kept tabs on one another and informed one another when things would be 'hot' because of a recent shooting,\" and \"acted on behalf of one another by attempting to assassinate witnesses to\n   each other's crimes.\" Id., at 33. The court ultimately concluded that, although the gang \"lacked some of the accouterments of more structured street gangs, a rational jury could find that it had a sufficiently well-defined shape to constitute an enterprise in the requisite sense\" because it \"exhibited group cohesion over time; its membership pooled and shared resources; the individuals involved had a sense of belonging and self-identified as [gang] members; and the group had a well-honed set of goals.\" Id.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-36\">\n   Similarly, in\n   <em>\n    United States\n   </em>\n   v.\n   <em>\n    Burden\n   </em>\n   ,\n   <extracted-citation case-ids=\"4224447\" index=\"94\" url=\"https://cite.case.law/f3d/600/204/#p214\">\n    600 F.3d 204\n   </extracted-citation>\n   , 214-16 (2d Cir.), cert. denied sub nom.\n   <em>\n    Buchanan\n   </em>\n   v.\n   <em>\n    United States\n   </em>\n   ,\n   <extracted-citation case-ids=\"12437634,6022403,12437636,12437635,12437638,12437639,12437637,12437641,12437642,12437643,12437640,6017680,6001689,5979307,5975860,5953462,6020296,6007630,6016232,5994994\" index=\"95\" url=\"https://cite.case.law/us/562/953/\">\n    562 U.S. 953\n   </extracted-citation>\n   ,\n   <extracted-citation case-ids=\"12437637,12436972,12436973,12436974,12436976,12437718\" index=\"96\" url=\"https://cite.case.law/s-ct/131/251/\">\n    131 S.Ct. 251\n   </extracted-citation>\n   ,\n   <extracted-citation case-ids=\"12437633,12437634,12437635,12437636,12437637,12437638,12437639\" index=\"97\" url=\"https://cite.case.law/l-ed-2d/178/251/\">\n    178 L.Ed.2d 251\n   </extracted-citation>\n   (2010), the United States Court of Appeals for the Second Circuit described the evidence of enterprise as \" 'somewhat contradictory' \" and having \"limitations\" given the lack of structure in the narcotics group, but ultimately rejected a sufficiency challenge.

After examining all of the evidence and the reasonable inferences therefrom, I would conclude that, viewed in the light most favorable to the state, the evidence in the record establishes that the defendant sold cocaine himself and facilitated the sale of cocaine by six other drug dealers, namely, David Moreland, Jason Ortiz, Willie Brazil, Raymond Mathis, Carlos Lopez, and Kenneth Jamison, from the porch of his duplex home on Pembroke Street in Bridgeport over an approximately six month period from June 25 through November 9, 2010.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-66\">\n   As the majority acknowledges, in the present case, there is no question that prongs one and three of the test set forth in\n   <em>\n    Rodriguez-Roman\n   </em>\n   have been satisfied. It is undisputed that the association had one main purpose-the sale of narcotic drugs. Further, the parties do not dispute the fact that the length of time, approximately\n   five to six months, was sufficient to permit the associates to pursue the purpose of the enterprise. Consequently, my main disagreement with the majority centers on the relationships of those associated in the enterprise. In answering this question, which concerns prong two of the test, it is especially necessary to examine the relationship of the defendant to the other people in the group. In performing this analysis, in my view, it is critical to examine not only the direct evidence of the association but also the inferences that the jury reasonably could have drawn from all of the evidence, including the exhibits and tapes that the police had made of the drug purchases.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-67\">\n   Evidence demonstrating the cooperative endeavor between the defendant and the six other dealers begins with the transaction on June 25, 2010. Specifically, David Hannon, a police informant, went to the corner of Ogden and Pembroke Streets to make a controlled narcotics purchase from the defendant. Before Hannon arrived, Sergeant Jason Amato saw the defendant in front of his house, standing with Moreland and Mathis. The defendant then left. When Hannon arrived, Moreland told Hannon that the defendant had gone to the police station to seek victims' compensation for injuries he had sustained in a shooting. Thereafter, Moreland went to the porch of the defendant's home to obtain cocaine from Mathis, and then Hannon purchased that cocaine from Moreland.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-68\">\n   The jury also found a sale on June 30, 2010, to be one of the two predicate acts in the pattern of racketeering. In the course of setting up the sale by telephone, Hannon called Ortiz, an \"associate\" of the defendant. After Hannon set up the sale with Ortiz, the defendant called Hannon to ask why he had not yet arrived at the meeting point. When Hannon did arrive, he called the defendant. The Appellate Court described the transaction that ensued as follows: \"When Hannon arrived at\n   the defendant's home, the defendant emerged from his backyard, walked past Hannon's vehicle while looking inside it, then continued to the street corner, where he gestured to Ortiz by raising his hand in the air. Ortiz then approached Hannon's vehicle and opened the door, whereupon the defendant came up behind Ortiz, reached inside the vehicle, and tapped hands with Hannon. Hannon gave Ortiz money, in exchange for which Ortiz gave Hannon the blue bag of cocaine that had been in his mouth. Meanwhile, another man approached the defendant. After completing the transaction with Hannon, when the defendant gestured to him once again, Ortiz handed something to the other man in exchange for money. Ortiz and the defendant then walked together toward the defendant's\n   backyard.\"\n   <em>\n    State\n   </em>\n   v.\n   <em>\n    Bush\n   </em>\n   ,\n   <extracted-citation index=\"223\" url=\"https://cite.case.law/citations/?q=156%20Conn.%20App.%20256\">\n    156 Conn.App. 256\n   </extracted-citation>\n   , 264,\n   <extracted-citation index=\"224\" url=\"https://cite.case.law/citations/?q=112%20A.3d%20834\">\n    112 A.3d 834\n   </extracted-citation>\n   (2015).\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-69\">\n   In relation to the June 30 sale, the jury reasonably could have concluded that the surveillance videotape showed the defendant exit his backyard, look for Ortiz, and command Ortiz with a hand gesture to get off his porch and attend to Hannon. While Ortiz was in Hannon's vehicle completing the transaction, a man approached the defendant while the defendant stood outside Hannon's vehicle overseeing Ortiz' sale. The defendant made another gesture to Ortiz and, in response, Ortiz sold drugs to the unidentified man. After the sales were complete, the defendant and Ortiz walked together to the defendant's backyard. In my view, this evidence demonstrates that these sales were not independent isolated events. Ortiz certainly responded to the direction and control of the defendant. In fact, a jury could have reasonably concluded that, aside from the collection of drug dealers assembling at the defendant's house, the defendant controlled the activities of the enterprise.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-70\">\n   The jury reasonably could have found that two other sales over the summer also established the association between the defendant and the other dealers. In particular, sales made on August 6 and August 24, 2010, demonstrate the association between the defendant and other dealers. First, prior to the sale made on August 24, Hannon made a telephone call to the defendant's home telephone number, which the defendant had given to Hannon after selling him cocaine on August 6. Moreover, in order to accomplish the August 24 sale to Hannon, the defendant obtained cocaine from Lopez, who was on the front porch of the defendant's home at the time of the sale. These sales demonstrate that the defendant and the other dealers were in communication with each other and shared customers and drugs to sell.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-71\">\n   Moreover, I would conclude that the sale on November 9, 2010, is particularly indicative of the ongoing criminal association between the various actors in this case. First, Hannon called the defendant with a number that he previously had used to contact Ortiz. The Appellate Court described the transaction as follows: \"When Hannon arrived at the defendant's home, the defendant was standing on the street corner with ... Brazil. The defendant got into Hannon's vehicle, and he and Hannon drove off. During their ride, the defendant made a ... call in an apparent attempt to procure cocaine, which Hannon had requested. After the call, Hannon and the defendant drove back to the defendant's home. On the way back, Hannon told the defendant that he also wanted to buy a gun, which the defendant said was 'doable.' When they returned, Hannon dropped off the defendant to speak to Brazil, then pulled around the corner onto Pembroke Street, as the defendant had directed. Once he did so [Moreland] approached Hannon's vehicle. When Hannon told Moreland that he had given money to the defendant, Moreland gave Hannon a quantity of cocaine. The defendant later called Hannon\n   to confirm that Moreland had given him the cocaine and to discuss further his stated interest in purchasing a gun.\" Id., at 265,\n   <extracted-citation index=\"225\" url=\"https://cite.case.law/citations/?q=112%20A.3d%20834\">\n    112 A.3d 834\n   </extracted-citation>\n   .\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-72\">\n   On the basis of this evidence, the jury reasonably could have also found that the defendant was the contact person for buying cocaine at the corner of Pembroke and Ogden Streets. All of the controlled buys orchestrated by the task force were scheduled with telephone calls to either the defendant's house or a cell phone that the defendant shared with at least one other dealer. The defendant's association to the drug dealing enterprise was also established by the audiotape surveillance that captured his warnings and boastings. During\n   the July 14 sale, when Hannon introduced Dennis Sang, an undercover police detective, to the defendant as a buyer, the defendant assured Sang: \"You'll be alright man, I live right here man ... just don't bring no ... cops and we all right.\" During the July 16 sale, the defendant bragged to Hannon and Sang that they had nothing to fear when he was around. Also, during the November 9 sale, when Hannon told the defendant that he wanted to purchase a gun, the defendant told Hannon that was \"doable.\"\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-73\">\n   Additionally, the jury reasonably could have inferred the defendant's association to the enterprise from his testimony. He testified that Ortiz and Moreland were his \"associates,\" that he sold drugs, and that he bought drugs from the candy store. He also testified that he never called the police on dealers who were selling from his porch because he \"don't tell on\" anybody. In addition, he testified that he was friendly with the \"younger guys\" who dealt drugs from his porch, so much so that they gave him free samples to test the quality of their product.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-74\">\n   Finally, the jury reasonably could have inferred that the defendant took steps to protect the arrangement\n   with the six other dealers. First, on July 14, he admonished Hannon, who at the time was accompanied by Sang, not to bring the police near his house. The defendant testified that he had allowed the other dealers to continue dealing from his porch and that he would not call the police on them. Although there was no evidence of profit sharing among those who dealt narcotics from the defendant's porch, and the defendant himself denied profiting from drug dealing, he nevertheless testified that he helped facilitate the other dealers' sales in order to obtain narcotics as gratuities, which he used to support his own addiction. Indeed, he described two of the dealers in particular, namely, Moreland and Ortiz, as his \"associates.\"\n   <footnotemark>\n    1\n   </footnotemark>\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-75\">\n   This pattern of cooperation and support between the defendant and the dealers whom he permitted to sell narcotics from a common location, the front porch of his home, facilitated by the use of common or shared telephones, supports the jury's inference that an enterprise existed. This conclusion is supported by federal court decisions under the Racketeer Influenced and Corrupt Organizations Act (RICO),\n   <extracted-citation index=\"226\" url=\"https://cite.case.law/citations/?q=18%20U.S.C.%20%C2%A7%201961\">\n    18 U.S.C. \u00a7 1961\n   </extracted-citation>\n   et seq.

On the basis of the surveillance videos contained within the record and the testimony from the witnesses presented at trial, a drug dealing association in fact existed at the defendant's house where he and at least six other dealers sold cocaine from a single location on the east side of Bridgeport.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-77\">\n   The jury reasonably could have inferred and found beyond a reasonable doubt that defendant was associated with a drug dealing enterprise because: (1) he lived there; (2) he warned Hannon and Sang not to bring any \"cops\" around; and (3) he committed two acts of racketeering when he sold cocaine to Hannon with two other dealers on June 30 and November 9. The\n   jury reasonably could have inferred that those two sales constituted a pattern of racketeering activity that had\n   a nexus to the enterprise because both sales: (1) occurred at the same location, namely, the defendant's home; (2) had the same purpose, namely, the sale of cocaine; (3) had similar participants; and (4) began with a call to either the defendant's home telephone, or a cell phone that the defendant shared with at least one other dealer and used to fulfill orders. Also, the jury reasonably could have inferred from the evidence that the sales on June 30 and November 9 were not isolated incidents. The investigation lasted months, during which the task force observed the defendant commit a total of six sales of cocaine.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-78\">\n   I respectfully disagree with the majority's conclusion that \"there is no evidence that they functioned as a continuing unit or even an informal organization.... [T]he evidence ... does not establish the requisite relationships necessary to sustain a finding of an enterprise. Indeed, it is well short of the evidence that two United States Courts of Appeal have characterized as minimally sufficient to establish the existence of an association in fact under RICO.\" Two of the cases cited by the majority to support its conclusion actually affirmed RICO convictions. See\n   <em>\n    United States\n   </em>\n   v\n   <em>\n    . Burden\n   </em>\n   , supra,\n   <extracted-citation case-ids=\"4224447\" index=\"251\" url=\"https://cite.case.law/f3d/600/204/#p214\">\n    600 F.3d at\n   </extracted-citation>\n   214-16 ;\n   <em>\n    United States\n   </em>\n   v.\n   <em>\n    Nascimento\n   </em>\n   , supra,\n   <extracted-citation case-ids=\"3468711\" index=\"252\" url=\"https://cite.case.law/f3d/491/25/#p33\">\n    491 F.3d at 33\n   </extracted-citation>\n   . In the present case, the group had multiple members who joined in the shared purpose of selling drugs and promoting such sales with evidence of a common meeting place. Further, as demonstrated by the surveillance tapes, the defendant directed the flow of drugs and what dealer should deal with what customer. The defendant also set the ground rules for participating on the porch by stating that no one informs on anyone else and instructed the members not to bring the police. Also, although there is no direct evidence of violence in this case, the defendant, in response to a question posed Hannon, indicated that he could arrange for the purchase of a gun.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-79\">\n   <em>\n    United States\n   </em>\n   v.\n   <em>\n    Burden\n   </em>\n   , supra, at 215 (recognizing \"organizing acts of violence\" as evidence of association in fact). Finally, when drugs were needed, it was clear that the defendant would obtain the drugs from other members to make his sale. When one adds the evidence that the defendant's cell phone and home telephone number were used by other dealers to complete other sales, I would conclude that there is no doubt that the jury had more than sufficient evidence upon which to conclude that the defendant was guilty of violating CORA.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-80\">\n   I respectfully disagree with the majority's statement that \"all that the evidence in the present case proves is an aggregation of apparently friendly individuals involved in various narcotics transactions, with no indication of ties to demonstrate a sustained pattern of cooperation among them.\" The sharing of cell phones, drugs, meeting places, directions from the defendant, and rules of transaction made by the defendant, belie that description. I further respectfully disagree with the majority's conclusion that \"upholding the jury's verdict in the present case would mean that virtually any cooperation by a defendant with others in connection with the sale of narcotics would have the impermissible result of turning 'garden variety criminal activity undertakings' into racketeering punishable under statutes such as CORA.\" I disagree. There would not be a CORA violation where you had a loose association with no sharing of telephones, no sharing of drugs, no common meeting place, and no direction from one individual. An example of a set of facts that would not justify a CORA violation is given in the majority opinion.\n   <em>\n    Jackson\n   </em>\n   v.\n   <em>\n    State\n   </em>\n   ,\n   <extracted-citation case-ids=\"9085391\" index=\"253\" url=\"https://cite.case.law/so-2d/858/1211/\">\n    858 So.2d 1211\n   </extracted-citation>\n   (Fla.

In\n   <em>\n    Jackson\n   </em>\n   , a group of dealers were friendly with each other and met in a park to sell drugs.\n   <extracted-citation case-ids=\"9085391\" index=\"254\" url=\"https://cite.case.law/so-2d/858/1211/\">\n    Id., at 1212\n   </extracted-citation>\n   . The defendant in that case was not involved in: (1) sharing drugs; (2)\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-82\">\n   sharing cell phones; or (3) receiving direction from one member. Under those facts, I would agree that the fact that the members in the group were friendly with each other and sold drugs in the same common public location is not sufficient to establish an association. In the present case, regardless of whether the facts establish that this is a \" 'garden variety' \" drug operation, I would conclude that conducting such an operation with a group of six other drug dealers on the porch of a private home or adjoining public streets, and dispensing drugs to people stopping in front of the porch as if it were a drive-through window at a twenty-four hour pharmacy, is the very type of activity that CORA was intended to punish. In my view, the majority opinion does not follow our directive to look at the verdict in the light most favorable to sustaining it, and not to act as the thirteenth juror in a case where the jury has already convicted the defendant based upon the sufficient evidence presented at trial.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-83\">\n   Accordingly, I respectfully dissent from part I B of the majority opinion.\n  </p>\n  <footnote label=\"1\">\n   <p id=\"p-87\">\n    General Statutes \u00a7 53-396 (b) provides: \"In any prosecution under this chapter the court or the jury, as the case may be, shall indicate by special verdict the particular incidents of racketeering activity that it finds to have been proved by the state beyond a reasonable doubt.\"\n   </p>\n  </footnote>\n  <footnote label=\"2\">\n   <p id=\"p-88\">\n    We granted the state's petition for certification to appeal limited to the following issues: (1) \"Did the Appellate Court properly conclude that the state failed to adduce sufficient evidence to convict the defendant of a violation of General Statutes \u00a7 53-395 (c) ?\"; and (2) \"Did the Appellate Court properly conclude that the trial court violated the self-represented defendant's sixth amendment right to self-representation by denying his request for a reasonable continuance to review his attorney's case before the start of evidence at trial?\"\n    <em>\n     State\n    </em>\n    v.\n    <em>\n     Bush\n    </em>\n    ,\n    <extracted-citation index=\"255\" url=\"https://cite.case.law/citations/?q=317%20Conn.%20903\">\n     317 Conn. 903\n    </extracted-citation>\n    , 903-904,\n    <extracted-citation index=\"256\" url=\"https://cite.case.law/citations/?q=114%20A.3d%201219\">\n     114 A.3d 1219\n    </extracted-citation>\n    (2015).\n   </p>\n  </footnote>\n  <footnote label=\"3\">\n   <p id=\"p-89\">\n    General Statutes \u00a7 53-395 (c) provides: \"It is unlawful for any person employed by, or associated with, any enterprise to knowingly conduct or participate in, directly or indirectly, such enterprise through a pattern of racketeering activity or through the collection of an unlawful debt.\"\n   </p>\n  </footnote>\n  <footnote label=\"4\">\n   <p id=\"p-90\">\n    We note that the state did not specifically allege in the operative information that Brazil, Jamison, and Lopez had participated in any of the narcotics sales of which the defendant was convicted, including those alleged as predicate acts for the racketeering charge.

This, however, begs the question in this appeal, namely, the scope of the special verdict. In the present case, the jury's verdict as to CORA was a general one, with only the acts constituting the pattern of racketeering being found specifically, as is required by \u00a7 53-396 (b). Neither the jury instruction nor the special verdict form restricted the jury's inquiry or required specification of its findings with respect to the enterprise element of racketeering under CORA.

The enterprise is an entity, for present purposes a group of persons associated together for a common purpose of engaging in a course of conduct. The pattern of racketeering activity is, on the other hand, a series of criminal acts as defined by the statute. The former is proved by evidence of an ongoing organization, formal or informal, and by evidence that the various associates function as a continuing unit. The latter is proved by evidence of the requisite number of acts of racketeering committed by the participants in the enterprise.

Specifically, the state argues that the Appellate Court's conclusion that \"Thursday night, Friday, Saturday, and Sunday was an inadequate amount of time for the defendant to meaningfully review the state's disclosure\" was predicated \"upon the erroneous assumption that the defendant had never seen those documents during the eight months prior to trial when he was represented by counsel,\" particularly given that the trial court had granted a continuance four months earlier to allow Hutchinson to review the state's belated and voluminous disclosure. The defendant, however, emphasizes that his statements in the record demonstrate that he had not received any documents from Hutchinson, and that this lapse was a factor contributing to the breakdown of their relationship. The defendant also relies on Hutchinson's representation to the trial court that \"whether [he represents himself] or there's an attorney, whoever is defending the case would be looking at these papers all weekend long,\" as demonstrating that the defendant had not seen them before. Even if we accept the defendant's reading of the record, which he contends demonstrates that he had personally never seen those documents prior to the commencement of trial, the trial court nevertheless did not abuse its discretion in denying the continuance. Given the late assertion of the defendant's right to self-representation and the fact that several jurors had already been selected, the trial court reasonably relied on Hutchinson's representations, as an officer of the court, that she had culled the portions that related specifically to the defendant for his review. This is particularly so, given that Hutchinson remained in the case as standby counsel and would have been available to advise the defendant with respect to the content of the remaining records.\n   </p>\n  </footnote>\n  <footnote label=\"1\">\n   <p id=\"p-212\">\n    I acknowledge the state's reliance on the language used to describe the quantities of cocaine purchased, as well as the packaging of that cocaine and the fact that the dealers concealed those packages in their mouths, as evidence of the enterprise.
