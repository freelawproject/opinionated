A. D.</author>\n<p id=\"Avn\">Plaintiff\u2019s domestic servant obtained a workmen\u2019s compensation award against him for injuries she sustained while employed in his home. He paid the award, and then sued defendant in this action to recover the amount of the award plus the expenses incurred in contesting it. The trial judge entered judgment of dismissal at the end of plaintiff\u2019s ease, and he appeals.</p>\n<p id=\"b130-7\">Plaintiff\u2019s first point is that defendant\u2019s policy, captioned \u201cComprehensive Personal Liability Policy,\u201d covers the workmen\u2019s compensation claims of domestic servants, citing <em>Gunther v. Metropolitan Cas. Ins. Co., </em>33 <em>N. J. Super. </em>101 <em>(Law Div. </em>1954).</p>\n<p id=\"b130-8\">After <em>Gunther </em>was decided the National Bureau of Casualty and Surety Underwriters deleted from such policies the words \u201c(2) any residence employee of the insured while engaged in the employment of the insured.\u201d <em>(Gunther, </em>33 <em>N. J. Super., </em>at <em>p. </em>104; Robert E. Rodes, Jr., \u201cInsurance,\u201d \u201cAnnual Survey of New Jersey Law,\u201d 10 <em>Rutgers L. Rev. </em>219, at <em>p. </em>233 (1955)). Therefore, when the policy sued upon was issued, in 1956, the exclusionary clause provided (emphasis ours):</p>\n<blockquote id=\"b130-10\">\u201cThis policy does not apply:</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b130-11\">(d) to bodily injury to * * * any employee of the insured arising out of and in the course of his employment by the insured, if benefits therefor are in whole or in part either payable or required to be provided under any workmen\u2019s compensation law, <em>or if the insured has in effect on the date of the occurrence a policy providing worhmen\u2019s compensation benefits for such employee; </em>* 5\u00a1\u00ed * \u00bb</blockquote>\n<p id=\"b131-3\"><page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"113\">*113</page-number>Plaintiff contends that the above mentioned deletion did not succeed in eliminating the domestic servant workmen\u2019s compensation coverage, and that the reasoning of the <em>Gunther </em>case still applies and makes defendant liable.</p>\n<p id=\"b131-4\">That is not so. The court had no doubt, in <em>Gunther, </em>that the insurance company had no intention to indemnify against the workmen\u2019s compensation claims of domestic servants. The reason that the company was held liable in that case was because of the use of the words which have now been eliminated. The court held that \u201cProfessor Corbin\u2019s 'reasonable and disinterested third party,\u2019 \u201d (and therefore the insured) had the right to understand those words \u201cto mean that defendant meant to take the special class 'residence employees\u2019 out of the general class 'any employee\u2019 * * * and therefore, although workmen\u2019s compensation claims by employees generally * * * [were] not covered by the policy, workmen\u2019s compensation claims of residence employees * * * [were] covered. * * *\u201d <em>(Gunther, </em>33 <em>N. J. Super-, </em>at <em>pp. </em>104-105, 113-114; <em>cf. </em>Rodes, \u201cInsurance,\u201d <em>supra, </em>at <em>pp. </em>232-234, 236-239.) In <em>Gunther, </em>court and counsel agreed that if the words which have since been eliminated did not appear, there would be no such coverage (33 <em>N. J. Super., </em>at <em>p. </em>114). Therefore, since those words have been taken out, there remains no basis upon which the insured may validly argue that the language of the policy covers such claims. As was pointed out in <em>Gunther, </em>33 <em>N. J. Super., </em>at <em>p. </em>110, this form was prepared for use in most, and perhaps all, of the states, and the emphasized words of the exclusion were drafted by the underwriters out of excess of caution, for use in those states in which domestic servants are not covered by the workmen\u2019s compensation act unless the employer indicates his election to place them under the act by obtaining a workmen\u2019s compensation policy.</p>\n<p id=\"b131-7\">Plaintiff attempted to prove that defendant was estopped to deny coverage. That proof was predicated upon dealings and conversations with Frenkel &amp; Company, Inc. (Frenkel), <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"114\">*114</page-number>allegedly defendant\u2019s agent. Erenkel had not countersigned the policy. Plaintiff called no witnesses to prove Frenkel\u2019s agency, but offered the following interrogatory and answer:</p>\n<blockquote id=\"b132-4\">\u201c* * * state what the relationship of Frenkel &amp; Company was to the defendant in 1957 and particularly in May of 1957.</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b132-6\">Answer: Frenkel &amp; Company was authorized agent of the defendant.\u201d</blockquote>\n<p id=\"b132-8\">However, before the pretrial defendant had served upon plaintiff an amended answer to that interrogatory, saying \u201cFrenkel &amp; Company, Inc. is not an agent of the defendant, but a general insurance broker.\u201d In the pretrial order, dated February 24, 1960, defendant contended that it \u201cissued the policy ordered by the broker, Frenkel &amp; Company, Inc., and that these brokers are not the general agents\u201d of defendant.</p>\n<p id=\"b132-9\">The trial took place in May 1960. It does not appear that plaintiff at any time took any step with reference to the amended answer to the interrogatory. Ho effort was made to take any depositions, or to propound further interrogatories on the question of agency, or otherwise challenge the amendment. Under these circumstances, the trial court refused to admit the original answer to the interrogatory as an admission of agency. Since'no other proof of agency was introduced, the trial court excluded testimony of dealings and conversations with Frenkel.</p>\n<p id=\"b132-10\">Plaintiff contends that this was error; that the original answer should have been received as <em>prima facie </em>proof of agency, the argument being that the rules do not provide for such an amendment. <em>B. B. </em>4:23~12, says plaintiff, allows the amendment of answers to interrogatories only to litigants who \u201cshall obtain information subsequent to the pretrial conference which renders such answers incomplete.\u201d</p>\n<p id=\"b132-11\">That is not so. <em>Branch v. Emery Transportation Co., </em>53 <em>N. J. Super. 367 (App. Div. 1958). </em>\u201cThe design of the rules is the facilitation of business and the advancement of justice, to the end that causes will be determined <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"115\">*115</page-number>on the merits.\u201d <em>(Branch, </em>53 <em>N. J. Super., </em>at <em>p. 375) </em>The contention made by plaintiff here is contrary to that design. Litigation is not children\u2019s play, where \u201ctouch black, never get it back.\u201d In answer to interrogatories a party frequently must state matters not within his personal knowledge. <em>2 SchniUer \u00e9 Wildslein, N. J. Rules Service, </em>A IV\u2014633-634. A corollary to that is the litigant\u2019s right to correct his answers when he finds them incomplete or untrue. \u201cThe polestar which should guide the trial court in the exercise in his discretion\u201d whether to allow or to recognize such an amendment ox correction \u201cis the just and expeditious disposition of the litigation on its merits.\u201d A superseded answer does not necessarily lose all utility. Eor example, it may be used in cross-examination, under proper circumstances; but where, as here, the amendment was made long before trial, without objection, the court properly ruled that the original answer could no longer be used as an admission.</p>\n<p id=\"b133-5\">Since there was no other proof of Erenkel\u2019s agency, the proffered evidence of negotiations and conversations with Frenkel was properly rejected.</p>\n<p id=\"b133-6\">Plaintiff contends that defendant is estopped from denying coverage because the policy sued upon was a renewal of an earlier policy identical with the one in the <em>Gunther </em>case, the argument being that it was defendant\u2019s duty to notify plaintiff that the renewal policy was not exactly like the earlier one. However, there is no evidence that there ever were any dealings directly between plaintiff and the defendant. The policies were delivered by defendant to Frenkel, and there is nothing to indicate that Frenkel ever thought either one covered any workmen\u2019s compensation claims, or that it was not aware of the change in the renewal policy. Transcending that, we are not convinced that there was any duty upon the insurance company to give express warning to the broker or the insured of changes such as this. What the defendant sold and what the plaintiff purchased was a package called a \u201cComprehensive Personal Liability Policy.\u201d Like all policies, this policy contained numer<page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"116\">*116</page-number>ous warranties, covenants, provisos, conditions, exceptions and exclusions. If the company knows of the insured\u2019s reliance upon the continued existence of a particular clause, it may be its duty to notify the insured of the excision of that clause. Likewise, if a change is made in the policy which materially alters the character of the \u201cpackage\u201d which plaintiff purchased, or imperils or destroys its principal coverage, a similar duty may fall upon the insurance company. However, we need not decide those questions in the case before us, for here we have no such facts. In the case at bar, we conceive that the insurance company was at liberty to make the change which was made without being required to bring it to the attention of the insured bjr any notice beyond that contained in the language of the policy itself. <em>Gf. </em>Rodes, \u201cInsurance,\u201d <em>supra, </em>at <em>pp. </em>233-239.</p>\n<p id=\"b134-4\">The judgment is affirmed.</p>\n</opinion>\n</casebody>\n",
