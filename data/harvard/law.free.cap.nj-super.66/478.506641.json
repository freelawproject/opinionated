A. D.</author>\n<p id=\"Axg\">Elcar Mobile Homes, Inc. (Elcar) sued D. K. Baxter, Inc. (Baxter) in the Atlantic County District Court for damages allegedly caused to one of Elcar\u2019s house trailers while Baxter was removing paint from the surface of the trailer by sandblasting. Baxter filed a third-party complaint against Hartford Accident &amp; Indemnity Company (Hartford) claiming that Hartford was obliged, under its policy issued to Baxter, to defend the action by Elcar and to pay any judgment Elcar might recover. Hartford denied liability. Hartford then served notice of motion for summary judgment \u201con the ground that there exists no genuine issue as to any material fact and that * * * Hartford * * * is entitled to the judgment as a matter of law. At the time of the hearing of said motion, Third Party Defendant shall rely upon the statement under oath of John Louis Crist * * The trial judge entered summary judgment in favor of Hartford, and Baxter appeals.</p>\n<p id=\"b498-7\">Neither the notice of motion for summary judgment nor the order granting summary judgment indicates upon what grounds the judgment was sought or granted. However, the parties agree that it was granted because the policy contains the following exclusion:</p>\n<blockquote id=\"b498-8\">\u201cThis policy does not apply</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b498-9\">(j) under coverage D, to injury to or destruction of (1) property owned or occupied by or rented to the insured, or (2) except with respect to liability under sidetrack agreements covered by this policy, property used by the insured; or (3) except with respect to liability under such sidetrack agreements or the use of elevators or escalators at premises owned by, rented to or controlled by the named insured, property in the care, custody or control of the insured or property as to which the insured for any purpose is exercising physical control, or (4) any goods, products or containers thereof manufactured, sold, handled or distributed or premises alienated by the named insured, or work completed by or for the named insured, out of which the accident arises; * *</blockquote>\n<p id=\"b499-3\"><page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"481\">*481</page-number>The policy is a fearsome document of 11 pages, with varying sizes and styles of printing and typing. Hartford issued a certificate summarizing the coverage afforded by the policy as \u201cManufacturers\u2019 and Contractors\u2019 Bodily Injury Liability; Manufacturers\u2019 and Contractors\u2019 Property Damage Liability; Owners\u2019 or Contractors\u2019 Protective Bodily Injury Liability; Owners\u2019 or Contractors\u2019 Protective Property Damage Liability; Automobile Bodily Injury Liability; Automobile Property Damage Liability.\u201d</p>\n<p id=\"b499-4\">Although the United States Supreme Court was speaking of a different type of policy in <em>Calmar Steamship Corporation v. Scott, </em>345 <em>U. S. </em>427, 73 <em>S. Ct. </em>739, 97 <em>L. Ed. </em>1125 (1953), what it said there (345 <em>U. S., </em>at <em>p. </em>432, 73 <em>S. Ct., </em>at p.-, 97 <em>L. Ed., </em>at <em>p. </em>1132) is apt here:</p>\n<blockquote id=\"b499-5\">\u201cConstruing such conglomerate provisions requires a skill not unlike that called for in the decipherment of obscure palimpsest texts. * * * One envies not merely the perceptiveness of Lord Mansfield in matters of commercial law but his genial means of informing himself. We cannot resort to the elastic procedure by which Mansfield sought enlightenment at dinners with \u2018knowing and considerable merchants,\u2019 nor have we any Elder Brethren of Trinity House to help us.\u201d</blockquote>\n<p id=\"b499-7\"><em>Cf. Ferrante v. Detroit Fire and Marine Insurance Co., </em>125 <em>F. Supp. </em>621, 623 <em>(S. D. Cal. </em>1954); <em>Weil v. Pennsylvania Fire Ins. Co., </em>58 <em>N. J. Super. </em>145 <em>(App. Div. </em>1959).</p>\n<p id=\"b499-8\">Coverage D, to which the above quoted exclusion applies, is as follows:</p>\n<blockquote id=\"b499-9\">\u201cTo pay on behalf of the insured all sums which the insured shall become legally obligated to pay as damages because of injury or destruction of property, including the loss of use thereof, caused by accident.\u201d</blockquote>\n<p id=\"b499-10\">The policy described Baxter\u2019s \u201cPremises\u2014Operations\u201d as \u201cPainting, Decorating or Paper Hanging N.O.C.\u2014including shop operations. Painting ship hulls, steel structures or bridges to be separately rated. * * * Cleaning or <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"482\">*482</page-number>Renovating Outside Surfaces of Buildings. * * * Paint Mfg.\u201d</p>\n<p id=\"b500-5\">The \"Statement Under Oath of John Louis Crist\u201d mentioned in the notice of motion, and upon the basis of which the trial judge entered summary judgment, shows the following facts. Elcar was in the house trailer sales business. It had upon its lot a number of trailers, one of which had to be refinished to satisfy a purchaser. This required the removal of the old paint. Baxter was hired to do it by sandblasting. Crist was an executive of Baxter. He came to Elcar\u2019s premises with two men (Cole and a helper), where he was met by a representative of Elcar (Dietz), who pointed out the trailer that was to be sandblasted. The trailer was on wheels, but Crist said \"it could be moved by their [Elcar\u2019s] equipment, not ours. Our equipment was too small.\u201d</p>\n<p id=\"b500-6\">The trailer had already been \"masked,\u201d but more masking was needed. Crist sandblasted a 2'x2' section of the trailer as \"a sample blast,\u201d which was approved by Dietz. Crist then told Cole \"to go ahead, to finish masking and sandblast the trailer.\u201d Crist said he showed Cole \u201ca sample of what I had done, and then I made him do part of the back in my presence before I left.\u201d After watching Cole for a while, Crist shut off the compressor, told Cole \"This is the way I want you to continue to do the trailer,\u201d and departed.</p>\n<p id=\"b500-7\">The alleged damage was the \u201cbuckling\u201d of the metal, which gave it a wavy appearance. Crist said:</p>\n<blockquote id=\"b500-8\">\u201cQ. Have you had experience of metal buckling before upon use of the sandblasting equipment? A. No, not too much in that respect * * * that is one reason I had actually made the first shot, the first section in Mr. Dietz\u2019s presence, and then also instructed my foreman to go ahead and sandblast a section for me. * *</blockquote>\n<p id=\"b500-10\">Baxter sandblasted the front, back and sides of the trailer. The damage was discovered after the job was finished.</p>\n<p id=\"b500-11\">Since these were the only facts before the trial court upon the motion for summary judgment, Baxter contends that <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"483\">*483</page-number>the trial court erred in. holding that the trailer was in the \u201ccare, custody or control\u201d of Baxter, or that Baxter \u201cwas exercising physical control\u201d over it, citing <em>Boswell v. Travelers Indemnity Co., </em>38 <em>N. J. Super. </em>599 <em>(App. Div. </em>1956). Bespondent, on the other hand, argues that the trial court was correct, citing <em>Condenser Service &amp; Engineering Co., Inc. v. American Mutual Liability Insurance Co., </em>58 <em>N. </em>J. <em>Super. </em>179 <em>(App. Div. </em>1959); <em>Pompeii v. Phoenix Assurance Company of New York, </em>7 <em>Misc. 2d </em>846, 166 <em>N. Y. S. 2d </em>619 <em>(Cty. Ct. </em>1957), affirmed 7 <em>A. D. 2d </em>806, 181 <em>N. Y. S. 2d </em>152 <em>(App. Div. </em>1958), and the annotation in 64 <em>A. L. </em>R. <em>2d </em>1242-1255 (1958).</p>\n<p id=\"b501-5\">When the \u201ccare, custody or control\u201d portion of the exclusion was before this court in <em>Boswell, </em>we said, \u201cSuch words are inherently ambiguous * * In that case we held (38 <em>N. J. Super., </em>at <em>pp. </em>605, 606, 607) that</p>\n<blockquote id=\"b501-7\">\u201cIn such a case, the courts will take into consideration the apparent object or purpose of the insurance and, along with the context of the policy, the subject matter of the insurance, the situation of the parties, and the circumstances surrounding the making of the contract.</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b501-8\"># * ![t - * * *</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b501-9\">Exclusion clauses are strictly construed against the insurer, especially if they are of uncertain import. An insurer may, of course, cut off liability under its policy with clear language, but it cannot do so with that dulled by ambiguity. As with the provisions of the policy as a whole, so also with the exceptions to the-liability of the insure [r], the language must be construed so as to-give the insured the protection which he reasonably had a right to expect; and to that end any doubts, ambiguities and uncertainties arising out of the language used in the policy must be resolved in his favor.</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b501-10\">Since insurance contracts are phrased by the insurer, it is for the insurer to make them so clear that they contain no ambiguity as to their meaning; otherwise they must be construed most strongly against the insurer.\u201d</blockquote>\n<p id=\"b501-11\">In an article in the January 1959 <em>Insurance Law Journal, page </em>7, entitled \u201cCare, Custody or Control Exclusions,\u201d E. D. <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"484\">*484</page-number>Cooke, Jr., an insurance company superintendent of claims, tells us <em>{page </em>9) that:</p>\n<blockquote id=\"b502-4\">\u201cThere are several different reasons for such an exclusion in the policy. Fundamentally, were it not for the exclusion there would be a greater moral hazard as far as the insurance company is concerned. It also eliminates the possibility of the insured making the insurance company a guarantor of its workmanship.</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b502-5\">The liability policy contemplates payment generally in situations where the ordinary degree of care is the measure of liability. The premium is determined on that basis. Biability for damage to property in charge of or in the care, custody or control of the insured <em>lohere there is a bailment </em>is controlled by different rules of law, and as a practical result the hazard is greatly increased.\u201d (Emphasis ours)</blockquote>\n<p id=\"b502-6\">The reference to \u201cgreater moral hazard\u201d appears to apply only to those sections of the exclusion clause which deal with \u201cproperty owned or occupied by or rented to the insured, or * * * used by the <em>insured\u201d\u2014i. e., </em>property with reference to which the insured might benefit by falsely claiming that it had been damaged by \u201caccident,\u201d or by exaggerating the loss. It is difficult to conceive how the question of moral hazard could arise with reference to property belonging solely and unconditionally to others.</p>\n<p id=\"b502-7\">We see also from Mr. Cook\u2019s explanation that the \u201ccare, custody or control\u201d and the \u201cexercising physical control\u201d portions of the exclusion clause are intended to apply when there is a bailment; and about this there appears to be no dispute. Boswell, <em>supra. </em>But what if there is no bailment? Since, then, the \u201cdifferent rules of law,\u201d which Mr. Cooke correctly says control bailments, do not apply, but \u201cthe ordinary degree of care is the measure of liability,\u201d is that not the type of situation in which, as Mr. Cooke says, \u201cthe liability policy contemplates payment\u201d? Hote, also, that if one were to apply the principles of <em>ejusdem generis </em>to the exclusion clause, one would conclude that the general words \u201ccare, custody or control\u201d and \u201cexercising physical control\u201d contemplated situations like \u201cowned,\u201d \u201coccupied,\u201d \u201cused,\u201d or \u201crented to or controlled.\u201d However, we need not <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"485\">*485</page-number>pursue these questions further, for in the case at bar the element of \"greater moral hazard\u201d cannot be said to have existed, and there was no bailment.</p>\n<p id=\"b503-5\">The remaining alleged purpose (and the only one pertinent here) is to eliminate the \"possibility of the insured making the insurance company a guarantor of its workmanship.\u201d It is quite reasonable for an insurance company to seek to avoid such liability. We should think that an accident policy such as the one before us does not guarantee workmanship, but if the insurance company thinks it needs to make that plain beyond dispute, it is a mystery to us why the insurer does not say so in simple language. It is not a concept difficult to express. See, for example, <em>Berger Bros. Electric Motors v. New Amsterdam Cas. Co., 293 N. Y. 523, </em>58 <em>N. E. 2d </em>717, 718, 156 <em>A. L. R. 1281 (Ct. App. </em>1944).</p>\n<p id=\"b503-6\">In <em>Innis v. McDonald, </em>150 <em>N. E. 2d </em>441, at <em>p. </em>444, <em>(C. P. </em>1956), affirmed o.b. 150 <em>N. E. 2d </em>447 <em>(Ct. App. </em>1956), the court said, and it is applicable here, that \"It would seem that the argument might better have been advanced to the effect that the damage incident to the quality of the insured\u2019s workmanship, in the absence of some accidental means, would not constitute damages \u2018caused by accident. * * \u201d</p>\n<p id=\"b503-7\">That question was not reached in the case at bar because, as we have said, the summary judgment was granted on the basis of the care, custody or control exclusion. Pursuant to our request, counsel briefed the question whether what happened here was an accident within the meaning of the policy. However, we find that the facts presented on the application for summary judgment are not sufficient to enable us to answer that question. It will have to be resolved by the trial court after a full exposition of all of the facts.</p>\n<p id=\"b503-8\"><em>Minkov v. Reliance Insurance Co. of Philadelphia, </em>54 <em>N. J. Super. </em>509 <em>(App. Div. </em>1959), is not conclusive upon that question. In that case, the business of the insured was described in the policy as \u201cIron &amp; Steel work,\u201d the operations as \u201cIron or Steel\u2014work-shop, Iron or Steel erecting\u2014\u25a0 dwelling not exceeding <em>2 </em>stories.\u201d The policy insured against <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"486\">*486</page-number>accidents caused by hazards incidental to those operations. Those hazards were defined as follows (emphasis ours) : \u201call operations * * * including pick-up and delivery, <em>installation, </em>servicing, removal or demonstration, and accidents <em>(except accidents due to misdelivery) </em>which occur after completion or abandonment of operations, \u25a0 * *</p>\n<p id=\"b504-4\">The contemplation that an \u201caccident\u201d might be due to \u201cmis-delivery\u201d (albeit, to be excluded) and the other language of the quoted clauses indicate the breadth of the term \u201caccident\u201d within the context of the Minkov policy. That breadth was confirmed by an endorsement which recited that eight paragraphs of the exclusions printed in the body of the policy were \u201cdeleted and the following substituted therefor\u201d:</p>\n<blockquote id=\"b504-5\">\u201c(1) Under Coverage B, with respect to Division 2 of tbe Definition of Hazards, to injury to or destruction of property arising out of the collapse of or structural injury to any building or structural injury to any building or structure due to excavation (including burrowing, filling or backfilling in connection therewith), tunneling, pile driving, cofferdam work or caisson work, or to moving, shoring, underpinning, raising or demolition of any building or structure, or removal of rebuilding of any structural support thereof; * *</blockquote>\n<p id=\"b504-6\">Therefore, we held that what happened in the <em>Minhov </em>case was plainly an \u201caccident\u201d within the meaning of the policy there involved. We said that \u201cto give the word \u2018accident\u2019 the meaning for which defendant argues would manifestly defeat the purpose of the policy which is to protect against liability in circumstances like those here present,\u201d but even then we added (since the case had been dismissed when the plaintiff rested), \u201cIn any event, in assaying plaintiff\u2019s proofs, * * * it is evident that the proofs raised a factual issue [as to whether there had been an \u2018accident\u2019] and it follows that the trial court erred in granting defendant\u2019s motion.\u201d</p>\n<p id=\"b504-8\">Mr. Cooke complains in said article <em>(p. </em>10) that \u201cfrom the judicial interpretations it is difficult to formulate a <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"487\">*487</page-number>clear and concise rule by which to measure, with some degree of certainty, any factual situation in order to determine whether or not it might be held to come within the exclusion.\u201d The annotation in 62 <em>A. L. R. 2d, </em>at <em>p. </em>1244, agrees, for it says \u201cGenerally speaking, no rule of general application can be deduced from the cases.\u201d</p>\n<p id=\"b505-4\">Mr. Cooke continues, \u201cFurther, some decisions clearly indicate that the courts have not grasped the intent of the drafters of the policy or the reason why such an exclusion is desirable.\u201d The <em>Boswell </em>case is among those he criticizes. Nevertheless, he is frank to admit (at <em>p. </em>10) :</p>\n<blockquote id=\"b505-5\">\u201cI might say that the insurance companies themselves in the past have done a lot toward perpetuating the confusion.</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b505-6\">You have heard the saying \u2018everyone talks about the weather but nobody does anything about it.\u2019 For years the same applied to liability policies of casualty insurance. Although the companies complained about judicial interpretations of the wording affording coverage where no coverage was intended, no one ever changed the wording. * * *</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b505-7\">The wording of a policy should not be cumbersome; nevertheless, it should be specific enough to express the intent. Other businesses are very quick to change the wording of contracts to better accomplish their purpose where judicial decisions have misconstrued the intent.</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b505-8\">With the tendency today to saddle the insurance industry with more of the economic losses of society, there is no reason why insurance companies should be reluctant to change wording which is outmoded by court decision and new factual situations so that it no longer accomplishes the purpose of expressing the company\u2019s intent\u2014even though it is necessary to spell it out in more detail and to change the wording more often.\u201d</blockquote>\n<p id=\"b505-9\">The article points out that in 3955 there were added to the policy the words \u201cproperty as to which the insured for any purpose is exercising physical control.\u201d In <em>Boswell </em>we said that the words \u201ccare, custody or control\u201d wore inherently ambiguous because \u201cthey are words of art which have been the focus of considerable judicial construction\u201d in many fields of the law. Therefore, the addition of the quoted words is mere tautology, as ambiguous as that which it purports to supplement.</p>\n<p id=\"b506-3\"><page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"488\">*488</page-number>The annotation in 62 <em>A. L. R. 2d, </em>at <em>p. </em>1244, remarks that \u201cIt is interesting to note that there is authority to the effect that the exclusion clause is inherently ambiguous and, on the other hand, that the clause is clear and unambiguous.\u201d That is merely because of the variations in the facts of the cases. The exclusion does plainly apply to the facts of certain cases. Eor example, if Elcar\u2019s trailer had been in Baxter\u2019s shop, while being sandblasted, the exclusion would, under the cases, clearly apply. See also <em>International Derrick &amp; Equipment Company v. Buxbaum, </em>240 <em>F. 2d </em>536 (3 <em>Cir. </em>1957). Therefore, the words that were added in 1955 may make it easier to say that the exclusion covers a given factual situation, but the exclusion clause as a whole, when applied to facts such as we have here, is still as ambiguous as ever. For example, in <em>Meiser v. Aetna Casualty and Surety Co., </em>8 <em>Wis. 2d </em>233, 98 <em>N. W. 2d </em>919 <em>(Sup. Ct. </em>1959), the insured, a plasterer, scratched windows while removing splatterings of plaster. The insurer was held liable, in spite of an exclusion clause identical with the one at bar. The Wisconsin Supreme Court said, 98 <em>N. W. 2d, </em>at <em>p. </em>922, citing and following <em>Boswell:</em></p>\n<blockquote id=\"b506-4\">\u201cThe facts in the instant case show that appellant [insurer] was uncertain as to the application of the exclusion clause in the circumstances here. When respondent first reported the loss, appellant\u2019s agent was not familiar with the type of coverage provided by respondent\u2019s policy but thought the loss would be covered and advised respondent to file a claim. After discussing the matter with the appellant, the agent called respondent and told him he had coverage * * * [Respondent discussed the claim with an investigator of the insurance company, a lawyer of several years standing, but it was not until a month later that appellant notified the respondent that the loss was excluded from coverage. These facts indicate that the appellant, as well as its agent, were not at any time sure of the construction which should be placed upon the exclusion clause and are entirely inconsistent with appellant\u2019s present contention that the phrase is unambiguous.\u201d</blockquote>\n<p id=\"b506-5\">See also <em>Haerens v. Commercial Casualty Insurance Co., </em>130 <em>Cal. App. 2d Supp. </em>892, 279 <em>P. 2d </em>211 <em>(App. Dept. </em>1955). <em>Cf. P. &amp; M. Stone Co. v. Hartford Accident &amp; </em><page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"489\">*489</page-number><em>Indemnity Co., Iowa, </em>100 <em>N. </em>W. <em>2d </em>28 <em>(Sup. Ct. </em>1959), and <em>Pompeii v. Phoenix Assurance Company of New York, supra.</em></p>\n<p id=\"b507-4\">In the <em>Innis </em>case, <em>supra, </em>the insured had contracted to paint a dwelling. He was required, among other things, \u201cto scrape all loose and scaling paint.\u201d In tile performance of his contract, he gouged the siding, door frames and window frames \u201cby the use of various scraping tools and sanding machines,\u201d and burned other parts of the siding and frames with his blow torches. The insurer conceded this was an \u201caccident\u201d under the policy there involved. The court held that the \u201ccare, custody or control\u201d exclusion did not apply to these facts, and that the insurer was liable. Since what the court said in <em>Innis </em>anticipated what we wish to say about the case at bar, we shall quote from the opinion at some length. The court said (at 150 <em>N. E. 2d </em>444-445) :</p>\n<blockquote id=\"b507-5\">\u201cThe essence of Buckeye\u2019s claim, therefore, is whether, under the terms of the policy, a distinction should be made between the \u2018care, custody or control\u2019 of the dwelling house as an entity and the \u2018care, custody or control\u2019 of that portion of the house on which the insured was to perform work, without regard to whether any damage was \u2018caused by accident.\u2019 To accept the contention of Buckeye in its full scope would mean that the policy would not coyer damages to any portion of the exterior of the dwelling house over which layers of paint ultimately were to be applied regardless of the extent of such damages or the manner in which such damages were sustained. Thus the accidental falling- of a ladder damaging plaintiff\u2019s hedge would be covered, but the accidental falling of a ladder gouging the siding would not be covered.</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b507-6\">Basically the claim of Buckeye appears to be that since the insured had the duty to exercise ordinary care as to the property on which he would perform services, such property was in his \u2018control\u2019 or at least in his \u2018care.\u2019 It should be noted, however, that the insured likewise had a duty to exercise ordinary care not to injure other property of the plaintiff, including the hedges, the automobile, the draperies, the interior of the house, etc. Buckeye concedes that damage to such other properly would be covered by the policy, and yet if we are to apply to the word \u2018care,\u2019 as used in the policy, the broad scope of the term as employed in the field of negligence law, the effect of such interpretation logically would be to exclude all liability coverage.</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b508-3\"><page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"490\">*490</page-number>Even if we were to conclude that the portion of the dwelling house on which McDonald, by the terms of the contract, was to perform work, was in his \u2018care, custody or control\u2019 at the specific moment that work was being performed thereon but that the policy would include liability for accidental injury to other portions of the dwelling house, we would still be faced with the problem of determining whether McDonald had \u2018care, custody or control\u2019 of more than that portion of the surface of the siding, door frames and window frames which would be affected by his contractual agreement to \u2018scrape all loose and scaling paint\u2019 and \u2018to apply two coats of paint,\u2019 and whether the gouging and burning extended beyond such portion of plaintiff\u2019s dwelling house. While this might seem to be a hairline distinction, we are inclined to believe that the underlying theory of Buckeye\u2019s assertion would compel such determination. In view of what has been said before, however, we need not determine this issue. Instead we predicate our decision on the basis that in the ordinary usage of English grammar, we cannot say that the property of the plaintiff which was damaged, admittedly \u2018caused by accident and arising out of the hazards hereinafter defined,\u2019 was property \u2018in the care, custody or control of the insured.\u2019 In other words, we cannot say that the language under consideration <em>clearly excludes </em>the operation of the contract of insurance.</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b508-4\">At best the language employed when applied to the facts under consideration is capable of several constructions, some of which would include coverage and some of which exclude it.</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b508-5\">In our opinion the construction urged by the plaintiff is at least as reasonable, if not more reasonable, than that urged by Buckeye. If it be the intention of Buckeye, in policies of this type to exclude coverage for liability for damage, even though \u2018caused by accident,\u2019 to property as to which the insured by the terms of Ms contract has a duty to perform some work, it would appear that the employment of precise unambiguous language could have accomplished this result.\u201d</blockquote>\n<p id=\"b508-6\"><em>Cf. Volf v. Ocean Accident and Guarantee Corp., </em>50 <em>Cal. 2d </em>373, 325 P. <em>2d </em>987 <em>(Sup. Ct. </em>1958); <em>Hauenstein v. St. Paul Mercury Indemnity Co., </em>242 <em>Minn. </em>354, 65 <em>N. W. 2d </em>133 <em>(Sup. Ct. </em>1954).</p>\n<p id=\"b508-7\">It may be argued that the <em>Boswell </em>and <em>Innis </em>cases may be distinguished from the case at bar because they dealt with realty. See also <em>Cooke, supra, </em>at <em>p. </em>10; 62 <em>A. L. R. 2d </em>1348-1351; but see the <em>Condenser </em>case, <em>supra. </em>We per<page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"491\">*491</page-number>ceive no basis in the policy or in reason for such a distinction. Would a 6'x6' metal tool shed attached to the realty not be within the care, custody or control of Baxter, while a railroad ear, a tractor-trailer, or a steamship would be? We are of the opinion that what constitutes \u201ccare, custody or control\u201d or \u201cexercising physical control\u201d depends not only upon whether the property is realty or personalty, but as well upon many other facts, such as the location, size, shape and other characteristics of the property, what the insured is doing to it and how, and the interest in and relation of the insured and others to it. Whether the property is realty or personalty, and the precise legal relationship of the insured and others to it, may be material in a given situation; but when they are, they are merely facts (more or less important, depending upon the circumstances) to be taken in conjunction with all other facts, in determining whether there is exclusion. So, in the <em>Condenser </em>case, the exclusion applied even though the property had become part of the realty. Conversely, even when dealing with realty, courts have held that the fact that the insured \u201ccontrols\u201d only a small part of a building does not necessarily defeat the application of the clause, where the insured damages the part which he does control. <em>Hardware Mutual Casualty Co. v. Mason-Moore-Tracy, Inc., </em>194 <em>F. 2d </em>173 (2 <em>Cir </em>1952); <em>Sanco Co., Inc. v. Employees\u2019 Mutual Ins. Co. of Wis., </em>102 <em>N. H. </em>253, 154 <em>A. 2d </em>454 <em>(Sup. Ct. </em>1959). <em>Cf. General Mutual Insurance Co. v. Wright, </em>7 <em>Misc. 2d </em>331, 161 <em>N. Y. S. 2d </em>974 <em>(Sup. Ct. </em>1957).</p>\n<p id=\"b509-5\">Equally unmanageable as a guide for decision is the attempted distinction between property damaged which \u201cis merely incidental to the property upon which the work is being performed by the insured,\u201d and property \u201cwhich is a necessary element of the work involved.\u201d The distinction is easy to make verbally, but we conceive that, when it was applied to a given state of facts, the facts have governed, and not the verbalization. The alleged distinction rarely dictated the result; rather it justified it. The insured is <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"492\">*492</page-number>entitled to rely upon what he reads in the policy. He is not expected to know the fine distinctions between realty and personalty, or to understand the nuances of \u201ccare,\u201d \u201ccustody,\u201d \u201ccontrol,\u201d or similar terms. <em>McAllister v. Century Indemnity Co., </em>24 <em>N. J. Super. </em>289, 294 <em>(App. Div. </em>1953), affirmed o.b. 13 <em>N. J. </em>395 (1953); <em>Gunther v. Metropolitan Casualty Ins. Co., </em>13 <em>N. J. Super. </em>101, 109 <em>(Cty. Ct. </em>1954). As we said in <em>Boswell, </em>\u201cit must not be forgotten that the primary object of all insurance is to insure.\u201d</p>\n<p id=\"b510-4\">Applying these principles to the case at bar, we find that the facts presented in support of the application for summary judgment are not sufficient to establish that the house trailer was within Baxter\u2019s care, custody or control, or that Baxter was exercising physical control over it, within the scope of the exclusion. We find these facts more clearly akin to those in <em>Boswell </em>than to those in <em>Condenser Service. </em>Therefore, there should not have been summary judgment in favor of Hartford.</p>\n<p id=\"b510-5\">The judgment is reversed and the case remanded for a plenary trial of all issues, including that of \u201caccident.\u201d Costs to abide the event.</p>\n</opinion>\n</casebody>\n",
