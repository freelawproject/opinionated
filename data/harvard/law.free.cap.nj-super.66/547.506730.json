During such period claimant worked for 11 weeks for M. C. Schrank Company (Schrank) at 439 5th Avenue, New York City. Schrank also had employment facilities in New Jersey and had employees who were covered by the New Jersey Unemployment Compensation Law. Claimant\u2019s employment with Schrank, however, was not covered by the New Jersey law but was subject to the New York Unemployment Compensation Law, and contributions thereunder, based on claimant\u2019s wages during the 11-week period, were paid by her employer into the New York fund. When claimant\u2019s employment with Schrank was terminated on March 7, 1958, she applied for and received weekly unemployment benefits from the State of New York until September 1958, when she obtained employment with Belmont Sheet Metal Works (Belmont) in Newark, New Jersey. This employment lasted for 21% weeks and was subject to the New Jersey Unemployment Compensation Law. When claimant\u2019s employment with Belmont terminated on January 23, 1959, she <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"549\">*549</page-number>filed a claim for unemployment benefits under New Jersey law.</p>\n<p id=\"b567-5\">The Division of Employment Security, which administers the New Jersey Unemployment Compensation Law, processed her claim on the basis of her employment by Belmont and Schrank and determined that her maximum total benefits would be $857.50 payable, as eligible weeks of unemployment were established, at the benefit rate of $35 per week for a maximum 24% weeks; 16 weeks, or $560 thereof, chargeable against the account of Belmont, and 8% weeks, or $297.50, against the account of Schrank. (Under the law, <em>N. J. S. A. </em>43:21-3(d), maximum total benefits are computed separately as to each employer and are three-fourths the claimant\u2019s weeks of employment by such employer during the base year, multiplied by the weekly benefit rate.) Claimant thereupon received unemployment benefits for nine weeks through March 29, 1959, and for ten weeks from August 3, 1959 through October 11, 1959, amounting to $665. No payments were made in April, May, June, or July because claimant was not actively seeking work due to pregnancy. She obtained other employment on October 13, 1959.</p>\n<p id=\"b567-6\">Sometime thereafter Schrank notified the Division that benefits paid claimant \u201cshould not be charged to their New Jersey account.\u201d On December 30, 1959 the Division made a redetermination of claimant\u2019s maximum benefits by eliminating her 11 weeks of New York employment. The Division also filled out claimant\u2019s employment with Belmont to a full 22 weeks. On the basis of the redetermination, claimant\u2019s maximum benefits were $577.50. Since she had been paid $665 in unemployment benefits, the Division demanded refund of the overpayment of $87.50. The Division indicated that it would not press for immediate payment but would use the overpayment to offset any future benefits to which claimant might become entitled.</p>\n<p id=\"b567-7\">Claimant does not dispute the fact that the original determination was erroneous and that she was overpaid $87.50. <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"550\">*550</page-number>Her position is that the error was not hers and that she relied on the original determination to her prejudice in that \"as a result of the time lapse between the January and December determinations plaintiff became ineligible to receive 'or apply for compensation she would be entitled to for employment benefits resulting from her employment with the M. C. Schrank Co. in New York City, N. Y. due to the fact that the base year of this employment period had run its course.\u201d</p>\n<p id=\"b568-4\"> Claimant\u2019s legal position is unsound. Benefit payments out of the Unemployment Compensation Eund can only be made in accordance with the provisions of the Unemployment Compensation Law. If benefits are improperly received by reason, of non-disclosure or misrepresentation of a material fact, \"of for any other reason,\u201d the Director is authorized by the law to direct recovery of the same. <em>N. J. S. A. </em>43:21-16(d); <em>Tube Reducing Corp. v. Unemployment C. C. of N. J., </em>136 <em>N. J. L. </em>410 <em>(Sup. Ct. </em>1948), affirmed 1 <em>N. J. </em>177 (1948). <em>Cf. Bartholf v. Board of </em>Review, 36 <em>N. J. Super. </em>349 <em>(App. Div. </em>1955). The broad public policy thus enunciated is that the Eund is not to be depleted except by valid benefit payments.</p>\n<p id=\"b568-5\">Claimant has asserted reliance on the erroneous determination'to her detriment. However, outside of her statement to that effect, no detriment was actually shown, and even if it had been established, would not prevail against the policy enunciated.</p>\n<p id=\"b568-6\">Affirmed. No costs.'</p>\n</opinion>\n</casebody>\n",
