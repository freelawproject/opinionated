Potter, appeals from the judgment of conviction, following his conditional plea of nolo contendere, of negligent homicide with a motor vehicle in violation of General Statutes \u00a7 14-222a. He claims that the trial court (1) improperly concluded that negligent homicide with a motor vehicle was not a \u201ccrime\u201d that made him eligible for youthful offender status pursuant to General Statutes \u00a7 54-76d and (2) abused its discretion in concluding that the violation he committed was of too serious a nature to permit him to be sentenced as a youthful offender. Because the defendant entered a plea of nolo contendere, he has no statutory right of appeal by which to request review of his claims. We therefore dismiss the appeal.</p>\n<p id=\"b116-10\">The defendant entered a plea of nolo contendere to the state\u2019s recitation of the following facts. On December 12,2003, at approximately 7:30 p.m., police in Wilton received a report of an accident in the northwest area of town, where a car had struck a tree. Officers with the Wilton police department responded to the scene of the accident. They determined that the defendant, who was seventeen years old at the time, had been operating a 1990 BMW while traveling northbound on Whipstick Road in Wilton. The only passenger in the car was the victim, Matthew Shaw, who was sixteen years old.</p>\n<p id=\"b117-5\"><page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"91\">*91</page-number>The accident occurred while the defendant was cresting a small hill on Whipstick Road. The road turned slightly to the right at the bottom of the hill and back slightly to the left at the crest of the hill. As he crested the hill, the defendant lost control of the vehicle. The vehicle rotated to the right and slid in a yaw for 124 feet, crossing the southbound lane of the road. The vehicle then left the west shoulder of the road and struck a tree, which was approximately two feet in diameter.</p>\n<p id=\"b117-6\">The crushing depth of the tree was approximately thirty inches into the passenger seat, so that the tree encroached into the passenger compartment area and reached the center console. The passenger was extricated from the vehicle and transported to a hospital, where he remained in the intensive care unit until December 13, 2003, when he died of the injuries he sustained during the accident. The defendant suffered a head wound. He was transported to a hospital, treated and released that evening.</p>\n<p id=\"b117-7\">On the basis of photographs, measurements and analysis by an accident reconstructionist, it was calculated that the vehicle was traveling at sixty-three miles per hour at the time it struck the tree. The speed limit on the road is twenty-five miles per hour, and a speed limit sign is posted 278 feet south of where the accident occurred. The defendant, therefore, passed the speed limit sign prior to driving off the road at almost three times the speed of the legal limit. There was no evidence that the defendant had ingested alcohol or any drug, legal or illegal, prior to or about the time of the accident.<footnotemark>1</footnotemark></p>\n<p id=\"b117-8\">The defendant was charged with negligent homicide with a motor vehicle. He filed a motion under General Statutes \u00a7 54-76c to be adjudged a youthful offender. <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"92\">*92</page-number>Pursuant to \u00a7 54-76d, the court denied the motion for two reasons. The court first concluded, as a matter of law, that the motor vehicle violation with which the defendant had been charged did not constitute a \u201cdime,\u201d as that word has been understood in General Statutes \u00a7 54-76b, and, therefore, the defendant could not be adjudicated a youthful offender on the basis of this charge. The court also concluded that, even if negligent homicide with a motor vehicle were the type of violation that could support an adjudication as a youthful offender, the facts surrounding the defendant\u2019s commission of the violation were so serious and resulted in such severe consequences that it would be inappropriate to adjudge him a youthful offender.</p>\n<p id=\"b118-6\">Following the denial of his motion to be adjudged a youthful offender, the defendant chose to enter a conditional plea of nolo contendere on the charge of negligent homicide with a motor vehicle. The court canvassed the defendant to ensure that his plea was entered knowingly, intelligently and voluntarily, and the defendant responded to the court that his plea was so entered. There is no indication from the record, nor does the defendant now argue, that the defendant\u2019s plea was somehow conditional on his ability to challenge the court\u2019s ruling on his motion to be adjudged a youthful offender. On November 17, 2004, the court sentenced the defendant to six months incarceration, suspended after sixty days, and one year probation.<footnotemark>2</footnotemark> This appeal followed.</p>\n<p id=\"b118-7\">The defendant challenges both bases of the court\u2019s decision denying him youthful offender status. He claims that the court (1) improperly concluded that negligent homicide with a motor vehicle was not a \u201ccrime\u201d that made him eligible for youthful offender status pursuant to \u00a7 54-76d and (2) abused its discretion <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"93\">*93</page-number>in concluding that the violation he committed was of too serious a nature to permit him to be sentenced as a youthful offender. The defendant concedes that because he entered a plea of nolo contendere, he has no statutory right of appeal by which to challenge the court\u2019s denial of his motion to be adjudged a youthful offender. See <em>State </em>v. <em>Cedric S., </em>51 Conn. App. 539, 540, 722 A.2d 299 (1999). Nonetheless, the defendant requests that we invoke our supervisory authority to review the court\u2019s denial of his motion because the court\u2019s allegedly improper interpretation of the youthful offender statute has the potential to affect future youthful offender applicants and, therefore, resounds beyond the facts and circumstances of this particular case.</p>\n<p id=\"b119-6\">Our Supreme Court has indicated that \u201cin the absence of a showing of good cause, an appellate court should decline to review an issue that has not been raised in accordance with the provisions of [General Statutes] \u00a7 54-94a [and] that such good cause is likely to be established only infrequently.\u201d <em>State </em>v. <em>Revelo, </em>256 Conn. 494, 503, 775 A.2d 260, cert. denied, 534 U.S. 1052, 122 S. Ct. 639, 151 L. Ed. 2d 558 (2001).<footnotemark>3</footnotemark> In order to determine whether the facts of a particular case warrant the exercise of our supervisory authority so as to review claims that fall outside the narrow scope of \u00a7 54-94a, we apply a three part test: (1) whether the defendant\u2019s claim gives rise to an important due process issue; (2) whether the undisputed facts of the case bear out the defendant\u2019s claim of a constitutional violation; and (3) whether declining to review the defendant\u2019s claim would permit a constitutionally suspect practice to continue or otherwise would permit the result to taint our judicial system. See id., 503-504; see also <em>State </em>v. <em>Chung, </em>202 Conn. 39, 43-45, 519 A.2d 1175 (1987).</p>\n<p id=\"b120-5\"><page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"94\">*94</page-number>Although we recognize that the defendant requests that we address a question of statutory interpretation over which there is some conflict, brought to the forefront in part because of this case; compare <em>State </em>v. <em>Sandra O., </em>51 Conn. App. 463, 464, 724 A.2d 1127 (1999) (trial court adjudicated defendant charged with reckless driving under \u00a7 14-222a youthful offender and Appellate Court did not address present issue) with <em>State </em>v. <em>Potter, </em>49 Conn. Sup. 170, 175, 867 A.2d 158 (2004) (trial court denied youthful offender application, concluding violation of \u00a7 14-222a not a \u201ccrime\u201d under youthful offender statute); any such interpretation is unlikely to alter the outcome of this defendant\u2019s case.<footnotemark>4</footnotemark> Here, the court did not rely on statutory interpretation alone in denying the defendant\u2019s application for youthful offender status; rather, the court also exercised its discretion in concluding that the circumstances surrounding the defendant\u2019s violation of \u00a7 14-222a were too serious to accord the defendant youthful offender status.<footnotemark>5</footnotemark></p>\n<p id=\"b120-6\">After reviewing the record, we conclude that the defendant\u2019s claim does not meet the three prongs of the test set forth in <em>State </em>v. <em>Revelo, </em>supra, 256 Conn. 503-504, and we therefore decline to exercise our supervisory authority to address the question of statutory interpretation he raises.</p>\n<p id=\"b120-7\">The appeal is dismissed.</p>\n<p id=\"b120-8\">In this opinion the other judges concurred.</p>\n<footnote label=\"1\">\n<p id=\"b117-9\"> The defendant\u2019s blood alcohol level was not tested.</p>\n</footnote>\n<footnote label=\"2\">\n<p id=\"b118-8\"> The defendant has served his sentence and has been released.</p>\n</footnote>\n<footnote label=\"3\">\n<p id=\"b119-7\"> \u201cSection 54-94a allows a defendant, to enter a plea of nolo contendere conditional on the right to take an appeal from the trial court\u2019s denial of a motion to suppress or motion to dismiss.\u201d <em>State </em>v. <em>Lasaga, </em>269 Conn. 454, 479, 848 A.2d 1149 (2004).</p>\n</footnote>\n<footnote label=\"4\">\n<p id=\"b120-9\"> To that extent, any opinion issued regarding the interpretation of the youth offender statute would be advisory in nature. \u201c[W]e do not render advisory opinions. . . .
