Irizarry, appeals from the judgment of conviction, rendered after a jury trial, of assault in the second degree in violation of General Statutes \u00a7 53a-60 (a) (2),<footnotemark>1</footnotemark> threatening in the second degree in violation of General Statutes \u00a7 53a-62 (a) (2)<footnotemark>2</footnotemark> and criminal mischief in the third degree in violation of General Statutes \u00a7 53a-117 (a) (1) (A).<footnotemark>3</footnotemark> He claims on appeal that the trial court improperly (1) admitted evidence of four instances of his prior misconduct and (2) restricted his cross-examination of one of the victims regarding that victim\u2019s purported theft of the defendant\u2019s social security check. We disagree with both of these claims and affirm the judgment of the trial court.</p>\n<p id=\"b252-8\">The jury reasonably could have found the following facts. In late 2002, the victims, Emma DeJesus, and her boyfriend, Wilson Correa, lived at 15 Prospect Street, apartment nine, in New Britain, and the defendant lived nearby at 59 Walnut Street. Mary Rubino, a testifying witness, lived next door to DeJesus and Correa. The defendant and DeJesus previously were married and had resided together for eighteen to twenty years. Cor<page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"227\">*227</page-number>rea and Rubino both were well acquainted with the defendant, having known him for years.<footnotemark>4</footnotemark></p>\n<p id=\"b253-6\">The outer doorway to 15 Prospect Street was secured, such that a visitor to the building, to gain entry, had to ring a bell for a particular apartment and speak via an intercom with its occupant, who then could admit the visitor. At about 4 p.m. on November 11, 2002, a friend of DeJesus rang the bell, and DeJesus sought to admit her. When DeJesus could not locate her friend in the lobby or hallway area of the building, Correa exited the apartment, and then the building, in search of the friend.<footnotemark>5</footnotemark></p>\n<p id=\"b253-7\">As Correa emerged from the building, he was accosted by the defendant, who was hiding behind some mailboxes and appeared to be intoxicated. The defendant possessed a hammer inside of a plastic grocery bag that he had wrapped around his wrist. The defendant struck Correa on the head with the hammer, causing a laceration about an inch long above his eyebrow. Rubino briefly exited her apartment and viewed the defendant and Correa scuffling.<footnotemark>6</footnotemark> Correa escaped and, soon thereafter, reentered the building through a different door.</p>\n<p id=\"b253-8\">In the meantime, the defendant entered the building and proceeded to apartment nine. Once there, he yelled for DeJesus to open the door, called her a bitch and said he was going to kill her. He also struck the apartment door with the hammer repeatedly, creating holes and breaking two locks. DeJesus pounded on the wall <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"228\">*228</page-number>separating her apartment from Rubino\u2019s and shouted to Rubino to call the police. Rubino did so, then exited her apartment to encounter the defendant banging on her neighbors\u2019 door with what appeared to her to be a hammer.<footnotemark>7</footnotemark> She advised the defendant to leave because the police were coming. The defendant replied that he did not care and that he was not there, and then left. Correa returned to apartment nine, and New Britain police officers Brian Murphy and Robert Paciotti arrived.</p>\n<p id=\"b254-6\">Correa, who was bleeding profusely, was taken by ambulance to a hospital where he received several stitches. When interviewed by Murphy, he identified the defendant as his assailant. Dejesus and Rubino also identified the defendant as the person who had damaged the door to apartment nine. Murphy observed the damage to the door and its locks.</p>\n<p id=\"b254-7\">On the basis of the information given to them by Correa, DeJesus and Rubino, Murphy and Paciotti went to the defendant\u2019s apartment at about 6 p.m. on the day of the incident. The defendant voluntarily allowed the officers to enter.<footnotemark>8</footnotemark> He denied being at 15 Prospect Street that day, but when the officers asked him whether he had a hammer, he pointed to one lying in the open nearby. The hammer was seized, and the defendant was arrested and taken to the police station.</p>\n<p id=\"b254-8\">The defendant was charged in a second amended long form information with assault in the second degree, threatening in the second degree and criminal mischief in the third degree.<footnotemark>9</footnotemark> After a jury trial conducted on <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"229\">*229</page-number>several days in February, 2004, the defendant was convicted of all of those offenses and received a total effective sentence of eleven years imprisonment.<footnotemark>10</footnotemark> The court also imposed permanent criminal restraining orders requiring the defendant to refrain from contact with DeJesus and Correa. This appeal followed.</p>\n<p id=\"b255-6\">I</p>\n<p id=\"b255-7\">The defendant claims first that the court improperly admitted evidence of four instances of his prior misconduct. We disagree.</p>\n<p id=\"b255-8\">The following additional facts and procedural history are relevant. Prior to the start of trial, the state filed a motion seeking to present evidence of certain instances of the defendant\u2019s prior misconduct pursuant to \u00a7 4.5 of the Connecticut Code of Evidence.* <footnotemark>11</footnotemark> The state argued, inter alia, that the evidence was probative of the defendant\u2019s intent in the present case and was necessary to prove an element of the crime of threatening. The court deferred rating on the state\u2019s motion until midtrial, at which time the state, outside the presence of the juiy, made offers of proof as to the incidents in question.</p>\n<p id=\"b255-9\">The prior instances of misconduct, the first two of which the state sought to offer through the testimony of DeJesus and the second two through the testimony <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"230\">*230</page-number>of Rubino, were as follows. (1) In 1987, the defendant attacked DeJesus with a machete, cutting her wrist, and attempted to attack her son.<footnotemark>12</footnotemark> (2) About two weeks prior to the hammer incident, the defendant came to the victims\u2019 apartment, and DeJesus\u2019 grandson answered the door. When the defendant saw Correa there sleeping, he rolled up his sleeves as if preparing to hit DeJesus, then said that he would not break her face because her grandson was there. The grandson pushed the defendant, who was drunk, out of the apartment. (3) Within one year of the hammer incident, the defendant came to the victims\u2019 apartment and banged on the door at about 3 or 4 a.m. He was holding a knife by its handle with the blade of the knife concealed up his shirtsleeve. (4) Also within one year of the hammer incident, the defendant came to the victim\u2019s apartment and banged on the door at between 2 and 4 a.m. He had a knife stuck down the back of his pants with the handle visibly protruding from the waistband.<footnotemark>13</footnotemark></p>\n<p id=\"b256-6\">After hearing the offers of proof, the court concluded that the misconduct evidence was probative as to the issue of the defendant\u2019s intent in regard to the charge of threatening and that at least some of that evidence was not overly prejudicial. As to the 1987 incident, the court ruled that DeJesus could testify as to the attack on herself but not the attempted attack on her son. It allowed farther that DeJesus could show the jury the resulting scar on her wrist. The court ordered, however, <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"231\">*231</page-number>that in discussing the incident, the word \u201cmachete\u201d could not be used but rather would be replaced with the word \u201cinstrument.\u201d The court allowed DeJesus to testily about the incident with her grandson but limited her testimony to the basic facts. It also permitted Rubino to testify about the two incidents in which the defendant, possessing knives, was banging on the victims\u2019 door in the early hours of the morning.<footnotemark>14</footnotemark></p>\n<p id=\"b257-6\">The witnesses proceeded to testify before the jury, as contemplated during the offers of proof, but restricted by the court\u2019s orders. Following DeJesus\u2019 testimony regarding the first two incidents of misconduct, the court gave a brief limiting instruction to the jurors, cautioning them to consider the evidence only for purposes of establishing the defendant\u2019s intent and not to show his bad character. Following Rubino\u2019s testimony regarding the second two incidents of misconduct, the court gave a similar- limiting instruction. In its final charge to the jury, the court gave a more extensive instruction as to the proper use of the misconduct evidence.<footnotemark>15</footnotemark></p>\n<p id=\"b258-5\"><page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"232\">*232</page-number>The defendant now argues that the court improperly admitted evidence of the foregoing incidents of his misconduct because that evidence was not relevant to the question of his intent to terrorize the victim. He claims further that the \u201cintent to terrorize\u201d element of the threatening count was not at issue. According to the defendant, the misconduct evidence was more prejudicial than probative and, as a result of its admission, his \u201cfundamental constitutional rights and . . . rights to a fair trial were violated.\u201d<footnotemark>16</footnotemark> We are not convinced.</p>\n<p id=\"b258-6\">\u201cAs a general rule, evidence of prior misconduct is inadmissible to prove that a criminal defendant is guilty of the crime of which [he] is accused. . . . Such evidence cannot be used to suggest that the defendant has a bad character or a propensity for criminal behavior. . . . Exceptions to the general rule exist, however, if the purpose for which the evidence is offered is to prove <em>intent, </em>identity, malice, motive, a system of criminal activity <em>or the elements of a crime. . . . </em>We have devel<page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"233\">*233</page-number>oped a two part test to determine the admissibility of such evidence. First, the evidence must be relevant and material to at least one of the circumstances encompassed by the exceptions. . . . Second, the probative value of the evidence must outweigh its prejudicial effect. . . .</p>\n<p id=\"b259-6\">\u201cThe primary responsibility for making these determinations rests with the trial court. We will make every reasonable presumption in favor of upholding the trial court\u2019s ruling, and only upset it for a manifest abuse of discretion.\u201d (Citations omitted; emphasis added; internal quotation marks omitted.) <em>State </em>v. <em>Smith, </em>88 Conn. App. 275, 285-86, 869 A.2d 258, cert. denied, 273 Conn. 940, 875 A.2d 45 (2005).</p>\n<p id=\"b259-7\">To prove that the defendant was guilty of the crime of threatening in the second degree, the state was required to establish, beyond a reasonable doubt, that the defendant \u201cthreaten [ed] to commit any crime of violence with the intent to terrorize another person . . . .\u201d General Statutes \u00a7 53a-62 (a) (2). We previously have defined \u201cterrorize,\u201d as used in \u00a7 53a-62 (a) (2), as meaning \u201cto scare or to cause intense fear or apprehension.\u201d <em>State </em>v. <em>Crudup, </em>81 Conn. App. 248, 261, 838 A.2d 1053, cert. denied, 268 Conn. 913, 845 A.2d 415 (2004). The state, therefore, needed to show that the defendant, while pounding on the door to apartment nine, threatened to kill DeJesus with the intent to scare her or to cause her to experience intense fear or apprehension.</p>\n<p id=\"b259-8\">We address at the outset the defendant\u2019s claim, repeated throughout his ar gument as to this issue, that he did not contest meaningfully the element of intent in regard to the charge of threatening and, therefore, the misconduct evidence was unnecessary to prove that element. Regardless of the accuracy of that assertion, we note that \u201c[ijntent, or any other essential element of a crime, is <em>always at issue </em>unless directly and explicitly <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"234\">*234</page-number>admitted before the trier of fact.\u201d (Emphasis added.) <em>State </em>v. <em>Baldwin, </em>224 Conn. 347, 356, 618 A.2d 513 (1993); see also <em>Estelle </em>v. <em>McGuire, </em>502 U.S. 62, 69-70, 112 S. Ct. 475, 116 L. Ed. 2d 385 (1991) (noting that \u201cprosecution\u2019s burden to prove every element of [a] crime is not relieved by a defendant\u2019s tactical decision not to contest an essential element of the offense\u201d and holding that extrinsic act evidence is not constitutionally inadmissible merely because it relates to issue that defendant does not actively contest). There was no such admission in this case. In any event, our review of the record demonstrates that the defendant, contrary to his claim here, explicitly contested whether he intended to terrorize DeJesus via his actions on November 11, 2002. In particular, as is evident from both his argument for acquittal and his closing argument to the jury, defense counsel attempted to downplay the seriousness of the defendant\u2019s conduct at the door to the victims\u2019 apartment and to characterize his intent as merely to irritate or to annoy DeJesus.<footnotemark>17</footnotemark></p>\n<p id=\"b260-6\">The defendant\u2019s claim that his prior acts of misconduct were not relevant to his intent to terrorize DeJesus on November 11, 2002, is similarly unconvincing. \u201cBecause intent is almost always proved, if at all, by circumstantial evidence, prior misconduct evidence, where available, is often relied upon.\u201d (Internal quotation marks omitted.) <em>State </em>v. <em>DeJesus, </em>91 Conn. App. <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"235\">*235</page-number>47, 56-57, 880 A.2d 910 (2005); see also 3 Jones on Evidence (1998) \u00a7 17:60, p. 481 (\u201c[ejxtrinsic act evidence is often a useful source of circumstantial evidence of what a person\u2019s mental state was on the occasion in question\u201d). Evidence is relevant if it \u201chas a logical tendency to aid the trier in the determination of an issue. ... All that is required is that the evidence tend to support a relevant fact even to a slight degree . . . .\u201d (Internal quotation marks omitted.) <em>State </em>v. <em>Erhardt, </em>90 Conn. App. 853, 861, 879 A.2d 561, cert. denied, 276 Conn. 906, 884 A.2d 1028 (2005). When instances of a criminal defendant\u2019s prior misconduct involve the same victim as the crimes for which the defendant presently is being tried, those acts are especially illuminative of the defendant\u2019s motivation and attitude toward that victim, and, thus, of his intent as to the incident in question. See, e.g., id., 860-61 (prior-incidents of defendant\u2019s physical violence toward victim tended to indicate he meant to cause her physical injury in charged crime).</p>\n<p id=\"b261-6\">Although we are unable to locate a Connecticut case directly on point,<footnotemark>18</footnotemark> we find guidance in a decision of the Supreme Court of Illinois rejecting a sufficiency of the evidence challenge and upholding a defendant\u2019s conviction pursuant to an antistalking statute. See <em>People </em>v. <em>Bailey, </em>167 Ill. 2d 210, 657 N.E.2d 953 (1995), <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"236\">*236</page-number>overruled on other grounds by <em>People </em>v. <em>Sharpe, </em>216 Ill. 2d 481, 519-20, 839 N.E.2d 492 (2005). That statute, similar to the threatening provision at issue here, required the state to prove that the defendant had threatened the victim \u201cwith the intent to place [her] in reasonable apprehension of death, bodily harm, sexual assault, confinement or restraint.\u201d <em>People </em>v. <em>Bailey, </em>supra, 243. The defendant was charged in connection with his statements to the victim, who was his former girlfriend, that she should kiss her children goodbye, that he was going to \u201cblow [her] away\u201d and that she would not \u201cmake it to [her next] birthday.\u201d (Internal quotation marks omitted.) Id., 219-20. The defendant denied intending to place the victim in apprehension of bodily harm, and he testified, in essence, that he and the victim, at the time of the events in question, had an ongoing relationship. Id., 220-21.</p>\n<p id=\"b262-6\">At trial, the state was permitted to introduce evidence of several prior instances of the defendant\u2019s aggressive and threatening conduct toward the victim.<footnotemark>19</footnotemark> On appeal, the Supreme Court of Illinois concluded that on the basis of this evidence, the trial judge properly found that when the defendant made the foregoing statements to the victim, \u201che possessed the requisite intent to place her in reasonable apprehension of bodily harm.\u201d Id., 245. In so holding, the court necessarily concluded that the defendant\u2019s previous aggressive and threatening actions toward the victim were relevant to the issue of his intent to frighten her by making the statements in question.</p>\n<p id=\"b263-5\"><page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"237\">*237</page-number>We conclude likewise in the present matter that the defendant\u2019s violent and threatening behavior toward DeJesus in the past was relevant to show his intent to cause her intense fear or apprehension on November 11, 2002, when he pounded on her door with a hammer and stated that he would kill her.<footnotemark>20</footnotemark> Given that the defendant previously had threatened DeJesus and, on at least one occasion, actually had caused her injuiy, the evidence of his past behavior had a tendency to show that by his actions on November 11, 2002, he did not intend merely to annoy or to irritate her, but rather, to cause her intense fear or apprehension. Accordingly, the court properly admitted testimony as to the previous incidents pursuant to the first part of the test for admissibility of prior misconduct evidence. See <em>State </em>v. <em>Smith, </em>supra, 88 Conn. App. 285.</p>\n<p id=\"b263-6\">As to the second part of that test, the defendant urges us to conclude that the evidence nevertheless was overly prejudicial due to its extent and character. We acknowledge that \u201c[a]ll adverse evidence is damaging to one\u2019s case, but [nevertheless, that evidence] is inadmissible only if it creates undue prejudice so that it threatens an injustice were it to be admitted. . . . The test for determining whether evidence is unduly prejudicial is not whether it is damaging to the defendant but whether it will improperly arouse the emotions of the jury.\u201d (Internal quotation marks omitted.) <em>State </em>v. <em>Ali, </em>92 Conn. App. 427, 434, 886 A.2d 449 (2005), cert. denied, 277 Conn. 909, 894 A.2d 990 (2006). Given the facts of this case and the nature of the evidence, we consider that standard to be unsatisfied. Admission of multiple instances of prior misconduct is not per se <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"238\">*238</page-number>improper; see, e.g., <em>State </em>v. <em>Hoskie, </em>74 Conn. App. 663, 667-70, 813 A.2d 136 (upholding admission of evidence of four instances of misconduct), cert. denied, 263 Conn. 904, 819 A.2d 837 (2003); and, furthermore, the misconduct evidence in this case was no more shocking than the evidence of the crimes with which the defendant was charged.</p>\n<p id=\"b264-6\">We observe in conclusion that the court, outside the presence of the jury, carefully considered the proffered misconduct evidence and the parties\u2019 arguments as to its admissibility before determining that it was more probative than prejudicial. The court in fact disallowed other misconduct evidence the state sought to introduce; see footnote 14; and ordered the admitted testimony to be stated concisely and phrased in noninflammatory terminology. Furthermore, although it was not required to do so, the court minimized any potential prejudice by repeatedly giving limiting instructions as to the use of the evidence.<footnotemark>21</footnotemark> The care with which the court weighed the misconduct evidence and devised measures for reducing its prejudicial effect militates against a finding of abuse of discretion. See <em>State </em>v. <em>Erhardt, </em>supra, 90 Conn. App. 862. On the basis of <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"239\">*239</page-number>the foregoing analysis, we conclude that the court acted within its discretion when admitting the challenged evidence.</p>\n<p id=\"b265-6\">II</p>\n<p id=\"b265-7\">The defendant also claims that the court improperly restricted his cross-examination of DeJesus in regard to her alleged theft of his social security check. We disagree.</p>\n<p id=\"b265-8\">The following additional facts and procedural history are pertinent to the claim. Prior to the start of trial, the state filed a motion in limine via which it sought to preclude the defendant from questioning DeJesus regarding a police report dated February 26, 2003.<footnotemark>22</footnotemark> See Practice Book \u00a7 15-3. The report was prepared by the investigating officer, Frank Surowiec, in response to a complaint from the defendant\u2019s landlord, Frank Maccarone, regarding an alleged larceny. According to the report, Maccarone told Surowiec that the defendant had authorized him to receive the defendant\u2019s mail when he was incarcerated following the hammer incident. He indicated that he had not received the defendant\u2019s February, 2003 social security check and that he believed DeJesus had it, although she said she did not. Maccarone also told Surowiec that he had spoken with another individual named Esperanza Tirado, who told Maccarone that DeJesus had asked her to cash the check. Maccarone additionally reported speaking with the local mail carrier, Michael Kristopik, who said he had left the defendant\u2019s mail, including the check, at DeJesus\u2019 mailbox.</p>\n<p id=\"b265-9\">The report indicates that Surowiec then interviewed Kristopik, who confirmed leaving the check \u201cat <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"240\">*240</page-number>[DeJesus\u2019] mailbox.\u201d Kristopik said DeJesus had told him that Maccarone was not getting the defendant\u2019s mail to him and that she was authorized to receive that mail. Kristopik reported that he believed DeJesus, knowing that she and the defendant had had a long-term relationship. He told Surowiec that once he learned that there was a problem with the defendant\u2019s mail, he ceased delivering it to anyone until he received written authorization from the defendant. Surowiec concluded his report by noting that he had attempted to contact DeJesus, Tirado and Rubino<footnotemark>23</footnotemark> but was unsuccessful.</p>\n<p id=\"b266-6\">In its motion in limine, the state argued that the report was based entirely on hearsay, that it never resulted in any arrests and that the case had been closed. It further characterized the issue of the missing check as collateral to the present matter. The court deferred ruling on the motion until trial, and, during the cross-examination of DeJesus, the jury was excused, the defendant made an offer of proof and the parties presented argument.</p>\n<p id=\"b266-7\">The court found that the police report provided a sufficient good faith basis for at least some inquiry, in particular \u201cbecause of the independent recollection of a mail carrier.\u201d<footnotemark>24</footnotemark> The court considered DeJesus\u2019 acceptance of the defendant\u2019s mail to be inconsistent with her earlier characterization of their relationship as over and, thus, relevant as to her credibility. It concluded, however, that on the basis of the police report alone, any claim that DeJesus had stolen the defendant\u2019s social security check was too speculative and, in any event, collateral. Ultimately, the court allowed the defendant to ask DeJesus only whether she told Kristopik that he could leave the defendant\u2019s mail, including the February check, with her and whether the defendant authorized <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"241\">*241</page-number>her to cash that check. It disallowed any questioning pertaining to the purported theft of the check or other peripheral matters.<footnotemark>25</footnotemark> DeJesus was recalled to the witness stand and answered the permitted questions in the negative.</p>\n<p id=\"b267-6\">Thereafter, following an offer of proof, the defendant called Kristopik to testify for the purpose of impeaching DeJesus. The court limited questioning of Kristopik to queries essentially mirroring those posed to DeJesus, i.e., whether she had told him he could leave the defendant\u2019s mail with her and whether he left the mail, including the check, with her. Kristopik answered those questions in the affirmative. The court also allowed defense counsel to inquire about what knowledge, if any, Kristopik had of the relationship between the defendant and DeJesus. Kristopik stated that the two used to be married and that he used to see DeJesus near the defendant\u2019s apartment.<footnotemark>26</footnotemark></p>\n<p id=\"b267-7\">During the offer of proof as to Kristopik, defense counsel had expressed concern about whether the state, on cross-examination of the witness, would cause Kristopik to appear biased against DeJesus due to a mild reprimand that he apparently had received from his supervisor for delivering the defendant\u2019s mail to her. The court, therefore, allowed defense counsel to attempt to lessen the effect of any potential impeachment by addressing that subject first on direct examination. Accordingly, defense counsel asked Kristopik whether, as a result of his delivery of the defendant\u2019s mail to DeJesus, \u201cthere [were] any ramifications to <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"242\">*242</page-number>[Kristopik] professionally?\u201d Kristopik replied, \u201cI was warned. I was given a warning, actually, because I was a little concerned, and I went to my supervisor, my postmaster, actually, explained what had happened, and he told me that I should always play it by the book.\u201d</p>\n<p id=\"b268-6\">At the close of her cross-examination of Kristopik, the prosecutor briefly revisited the matter of his reprimand. The following colloquy ensued:</p>\n<blockquote id=\"b268-7\">\u201c[The Prosecutor]: Okay. Now, you were asked some questions that you had some problems, minor problems, at work about this.</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b268-8\">\u201c[The Witness]: Well, I was concerned after things developed, and I sought out my postmaster and asked his opinion and told him what was going on and \u2014 -just in case something came back to him, I wanted him to hear from me first\u2014</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b268-9\">\u201c[The Prosecutor]: Okay.</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b268-10\">\u201c[The Witness]: \u2014 what had happened.</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b268-11\">\u201c[The Prosecutor]: All right. And he gave you a warning?</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b268-12\">\u201c[The Witness]: Well, he said, you know, never do it, always play it by the book.

So, I take it as a result of all of that, though, you probably weren\u2019t too happy with Emma. Is that fair to say?</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b268-14\">\u201c[The Witness]: Yeah, at the time. Yeah, I was disappointed. I felt misled.\u201d</blockquote>\n<p id=\"b268-15\">At that point, defense counsel asked that the jury be excused and proceeded to argue, in essence, that through the foregoing exchange, the state had raised <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"243\">*243</page-number>the issue of the missing check and, therefore, he should be allowed to explore that topic. The court disagreed, opining that the only inference raised by the state\u2019s questioning was that \u201cthe United States Postal Service probably requires postal carriers only to deliver to the named person at the named address unless it\u2019s in writing from that person to go forward it somewhere else.\u201d</p>\n<p id=\"b269-5\">The defendant now claims that the court improperly prohibited him from further cross-examining DeJesus concerning her involvement with the missing check, specifically, from asking her whether she had stolen it or had asked Tirado to cash it for her. He claims that those questions were proper to demonstrate DeJesus\u2019 bias or interest in testifying falsely, i.e., to show that DeJesus had a financial incentive to keep the defendant in jail because she could collect and cash his social security checks or that she was vengeful toward him \u201cfor causing a police complaint against her.\u201d The defendant argues further that the sought testimony was misconduct evidence admissible to undermine DeJesus\u2019 veracity in general. Alternatively, he argues that the state, during its cross-examination of Kristopik, opened the door to the admission of evidence regarding the missing check. According to the defendant, the court\u2019s rulings violated his constitutional rights to cross-examination and confrontation. We are not persuaded.</p>\n<p id=\"b269-6\">The law governing this claim is well settled. \u201cIt is axiomatic that [a criminal] defendant is entitled fairly and fully to confront and to cross-examine the witnesses against him. . . . The primary interest secured by confrontation is the right to cross-examination . . . and an important function of cross-examination is the exposure of a witness\u2019 motivation in testifying. . . . Cross-examination to elicit facts tending to show motive, interest, bias and prejudice is a matter of right and may not be unduly restricted. ... In order to comport with the constitutional standards embodied in the <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"244\">*244</page-number>confrontation clause, the trial court must allow a defendant to expose to the jury facts from which [the] jurors, as the sole triers of fact and credibility, could appropriately draw inferences relating to the reliability of the witness. . . .</p>\n<p id=\"b270-6\">\u201cThe confrontation clause does not, however, suspend the rules of evidence to give the defendant the right to engage in unrestricted cross-examination. . . . Only relevant evidence may be elicited through cross-examination. . . . The court determines whether the evidence sought on cross-examination is relevant by determining whether that evidence renders the existence of [other facts] either certain or more probable. . . .</p>\n<p id=\"b270-7\">\u201cThe trial court has wide discretion to determine the relevancy of evidence and the scope of cross-examination. Every reasonable presumption should be made in favor of the correctness of the court\u2019s ruling in determining whether there has been an abuse of discretion. . . .</p>\n<p id=\"b270-8\">\u201cThe proffering party bears the burden of establishing the relevance of the offered testimony. <em>Unless such a proper foundation is established, the evidence ... is irrelevant. . . . </em>This may be accomplished in one of three ways.</p>\n<p id=\"b270-9\">\u201cFirst, the defendant can make an offer of proof. . . . Second, the record independently can be adequate to establish the relevance of the proffered testimony. . . . Finally, the defendant can establish a proper foundation for the testimony by stating a good faith belief that there is an adequate factual basis for his inquiry. <em>A good faith basis on the part of examining counsel as to the truth of the matter contained in questions propounded to a witness on cross-examination is required. . . . A </em>cross-examiner may inquire into the motivation of a witness if he or she has a good faith belief that a factual <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"245\">*245</page-number>predicate for the question exists.\u201d (Citations omitted; emphasis added; internal quotation marks omitted.) <em>State </em>v. <em>Barnes, </em>232 Conn. 740, 745-48, 657 A.2d 611 (1995). We conclude that the defendant failed to establish, by any of these methods, the relevance of the claimed testimony. In short, the line of questioning he sought to pursue was based on wholly speculative information lacking the necessary indicia of reliability.</p>\n<p id=\"b271-6\">To begin, although the defendant made an offer of proof in the form of the police report,<footnotemark>27</footnotemark> that report did not constitute reliable evidence that DeJesus had stolen the defendant\u2019s February, 2003 social security check. The only indication of the theft or attempted theft of the check apparent from the report was in the form of a double hearsay statement uttered by one nontestifying individual to another and recorded by a nontestifying police officer, namely, Maccarone\u2019s statement to Surowiec regarding what Tirado purportedly had told Maccarone. Although Tirado apparently was present in the courtroom for at least some portion of the trial, defense counsel did not call her to testify as part of his offer of proof, nor was there any indication that he attempted, e.g., to learn more from Surowiec or Maccarone, to question DeJesus himself or to contact the Social Security Administration to determine the status of the check in question. Neither did he offer any other independent evidence showing that DeJesus had possessed the check that was left \u201cat [her] mailbox\u201d or that anyone had attempted, successfully or not, to cash that check. Finally, defense counsel never stated to the court that he had a good faith belief that DeJesus had stolen the defendant\u2019s check.</p>\n<p id=\"b272-5\"><page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"246\">*246</page-number>Insofar as there was no reliable evidence that DeJesus had stolen the check in question or, in any event, that she had the ability to cash checks payable to the defendant or that she still was receiving them, it necessarily follows that defense counsel lacked the proper foundation for questioning her about any financial incentives for her testimony. Moreover, because there was no evidence presented that DeJesus was even aware of the police report, the defendant\u2019s suggestion that she was angry with him due to Maccarone\u2019s complaint is entirely without basis. We conclude that the defendant, like the defendant in <em>Barnes, </em>\u201cattempted to use cross-examination as a tool to investigate purely speculative sources of witness bias, rather than as a tool to discredit testimony on the basis of a preexisting good faith belief that bias existed. [I]t is entirely proper for a court to deny a request to present certain testimony that will further nothing more than a fishing expedition ... or result in a wild goose chase.\u201d (Citation omitted; internal quotation marks omitted.) <em>State </em>v. <em>Barnes, </em>supra, 232 Conn. 749-50. Consequently, the court did not abuse its discretion in disallowing the proposed testimony for purposes of showing DeJesus\u2019 bias or interest in testifying falsely.</p>\n<p id=\"b272-6\">For similar reasons, the defendant\u2019s argument that the testimony should have been permitted as misconduct evidence, bearing on DeJesus\u2019 general veracity, also must fail. It is true that counsel has the right to cross-examine a witness concerning specific acts of that witness\u2019 misconduct \u201cif those acts bear a special significance upon the [issue] of veracity,\u201d and, further, \u201cthat larcenous acts tend to show a lack of veracity.\u201d (Internal quotation marks omitted.) <em>State </em>v. <em>Manns, </em>91 Conn. App. 827, 838, 882 A.2d 703, cert. denied, 276 Conn. 927, 889 A.2d 818 (2005); see also Conn. Code Evid. \u00a7 6-6 (b). Like questioning designed to expose a witness\u2019 bias or interest in testifying falsely, however, <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"247\">*247</page-number>questioning regarding witness misconduct bearing on veracity, to be pursued properly, must have some good faith basis. See C. Tait, Connecticut Evidence (3d Ed. 2001) \u00a7 6.32.4, p. 463 (\u201c[b]efore a witness maybe asked about his or her prior acts of misconduct, the questioner must have a good-faith basis for believing that the witness has committed the act inquired about\u201d); see, e.g., <em>State </em>v. Colon, 272 Conn. 106, 206-209, 864 A.2d 666 (2004) (holding that court did not abuse discretion in concluding that anonymous letter to newspaper editor did not establish good faith basis for cross-examining witness regarding his alleged prior misconduct), cert. denied, 546 U.S. 848, 126 S. Ct. 102, 163 L. Ed. 2d 116 (2005) . Here, for the reasons already explained, the proper foundation was lacking.</p>\n<p id=\"b273-8\">Finally, we disagree with the defendant\u2019s claim that the state, through its cross-examination of Kristopik, raised the issue of the missing or stolen check such that inquiiy into that subject by defense counsel became warranted. \u201cGenerally, a party who delves into a particular subject during the examination of a witness cannot object if the opposing party later questions the witness on the same subject. . . . The party who initiates discussion on the issue is said to have opened the door to rebuttal by the opposing party. Even though the rebuttal evidence would ordinarily be inadmissible on other grounds, the court may, in its discretion, allow it where the party initiating inquiry has made unfair use of the evidence.\u201d (Internal quotation marks omitted.) <em>State </em>v. <em>Powell, </em>93 Conn. App. 592, 599, 889 A.2d 885, cert. denied, 277 Conn. 924, 895 A.2d 797 (2006); see also C. Tait, supra, \u00a7 1.32.3, p. 94 (door may be opened on either direct or cross-examination).</p>\n<p id=\"b273-9\">Here, when cross-examining Kristopik, the prosecutor did nothing more than revisit the same subject that defense counsel already had addressed, i.e., whether the mail earner had been reprimanded for delivering <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"248\">*248</page-number>the defendant\u2019s mail to DeJesus absent the proper authorization. The answers given on direct and cross-examination were highly similar. The prosecutor\u2019s questions did no more to imply that Kristopik had been reprimanded because of a stolen check than did defense counsel\u2019s previous inquiry, and, therefore, did not open the door to exploration of that subject. In sum, the court did not abuse its discretion in disallowing questioning about the defendant\u2019s allegedly stolen February, 2003 social security check.</p>\n<p id=\"b274-4\">The judgment is affirmed.</p>\n<p id=\"b274-5\">In this opinion the other judges concurred.</p>\n<footnote label=\"1\">\n<p id=\"b252-9\"> General Statutes \u00a7 53a-60 (a) provides in relevant part: \u201cA person is guilty of assault in the second degree when ...

That evidence pertained to an incident in Puerto Rico in which the defendant purportedly chased DeJesus in a drunken rage, causing her to fall or jump down a stairwell and to suffer a broken leg. It also precluded, as not sufficiently relevant, evidence of further instances of the defendant loitering around 15 Prospect Street late at night, ringing the victims\u2019 doorbell or banging loudly on their door.</p>\n</footnote>\n<footnote label=\"15\">\n<p id=\"b257-8\"> The court instructed the jury as follows: \u201cNow, you will recall [that] during the trial, I ruled [that] some testimony, as well as some evidence, has been allowed for a limited purpose only.

This is not being admitted to prove the bad character of the defendant or the defendant\u2019s tendency to commit criminal acts. Evidence of prior misconduct is being admitted only to show or establish the existence of the intent to commit a crime charged, which is a necessary element. You may not consider such evidence as establishing a predisposition on the part <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"232\">*232</page-number>of the defendant to commit any of the crimes charged or to demonstrate criminal propensity. You may consider such evidence if you believe it and, further, if you fmd that it logically, rationally and conclusively supports the issues for which it is being offered by the state.
