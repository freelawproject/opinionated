On appeal, the defendant claims that he was denied various constitutional rights because (1) the trial court (a) permitted him to waive the assistance of counsel, (b) admitted unduly prejudicial evidence, (c) failed to dismiss the charges against him, (d) precluded him from presenting testimony from some of his witnesses and (e) ordered him to make a charitable contribution, (2) the prosecutor engaged in a pattern of misconduct and (3) the state presented insufficient evidence to convict the defendant of the crimes with which he was charged. We affirm the judgment of the trial court.</p>\n<p id=\"b123-7\">The jury reasonably could have found the following facts. In 1979, Christine LaRosa and the defendant met as members of the foreign language department of Middletown High School and enjoyed a friendly relationship until the defendant lost his teaching position. LaRosa also had a close relationship with the defendant\u2019s children, including his daughter, Tanya Caracoglia.</p>\n<p id=\"b123-8\">The charges against the defendant stemmed from the following incident. On June 21 and 22, 1999, LaRosa, a senior class adviser, was chaperoning an all-night postgraduation party. As the party was concluding, Tanya Caracoglia approached LaRosa and struck her in the mouth twice with a closed fist. As a result, LaRosa fell backward and suffered injuries that required immediate and follow-up medical treatment. She gave a sworn statement to the police, and Tanya Caracoglia was arrested and charged in connection with the incident.</p>\n<p id=\"b124-4\"><page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"98\">*98</page-number>The jury reasonably could have found that a hearing related to the charges against Tanya Caracoglia was scheduled to be held on September 14, 1999, and that LaRosa was expected to testify at the hearing. LaRosa did not attend the hearing, however, because she had received a threatening telephone call from an anonymous caller on September 11, 1999.<footnotemark>1</footnotemark> According to LaRosa, the caller was angry, threatening and evil. LaRosa recognized the caller as the defendant due to his distinctive accent. After consulting with her attorney, LaRosa reported the threatening call to the police. In January, 2000, the defendant was arrested and charged with harassment in the second degree and tampering with a witness. Following a trial at which the defendant represented himself, the jury found him guilty of both charges.</p>\n<p id=\"b124-5\">The court, <em>Holzberg, J., </em>sentenced the defendant to two years imprisonment, execution suspended after 120 days, and three years of probation on the conviction of tampering with a witness and an unconditional discharge on the conviction of harassment in the second degree.<footnotemark>2</footnotemark> The court also imposed special conditions of probation. As a sanction for violating its orders during trial, the court ordered the defendant to make a $500 charitable contribution approved by the office of adult probation.</p>\n<p id=\"b124-6\">I</p>\n<p id=\"b124-7\">The defendant\u2019s first claim is that the court, <em>O\u2019Keefe, J., </em>denied him the constitutional right to the assistance of counsel by granting his request to represent himself at trial. The defendant claims that (1) he was not compe<page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"99\">*99</page-number>tent to waive his right to counsel and (2) his waiver was not made knowingly, intelligently and voluntarily. The defendant failed to preserve his claim at trial and seeks to prevail on appeal pursuant to the plain error doctrine;<footnotemark>3</footnotemark> Practice Book \u00a7 60-5; <em>or State v. Golding, </em>213 Conn. 233, 239-40, 567 A.2d 823 (1989). We will review the claim because the record is adequate for our review, and the claim is of constitutional magnitude, but the defendant cannot prevail because the constitutional violation clearly did not exist, and he was not clearly denied the right to a fair trial.</p>\n<p id=\"b125-6\">The following pretrial history is relevant to the defendant\u2019s claim. During a pretrial proceeding before the court, <em>Clifford, </em>J., the defendant insulted the court with a vulgar' verbal outburst. After the defendant apologized to the court, his court-appointed counsel, Raul DavilaCarlos, requested permission to speak with the court at the bench. Following the bench conference, Judge Clifford ordered the defendant to undergo a competency examination pursuant to General Statutes \u00a7 54-56d.<footnotemark>4</footnotemark></p>\n<p id=\"b126-5\"><page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"100\">*100</page-number>A competency hearing was held before the court, <em>Gilardi, J., </em>on December 6, 2000. At that time, the defendant asserted through counsel, Daniel Dilzer, that he was competent to stand trial. On the basis of expert testimony, Judge Gilardi found that the defendant was not competent to stand trial, but that he was capable of being restored to competency after a period of treatment not to exceed sixty days. The defendant was committed to Connecticut Valley Hospital.</p>\n<p id=\"b126-6\">A second competency hearing was scheduled for February 6, 2001. The defendant waived the right to a hearing on the basis of his opinion that he was competent to stand trial. A report prepared by experts at Connecticut Valley Hospital concluded that the defendant had been restored to competency. On the basis of the report, Judge Clifford found the defendant competent to stand trial.</p>\n<p id=\"b126-7\">On January 11, 2002, Davila-Carlos filed a motion to withdraw his appearance. The court, <em>B. Fischer, J., </em>granted the motion to withdraw and ordered that a new public defender be appointed to represent the defendant. The defendant was granted several postponements, at his request, in order to secure private counsel. The defendant, however, was unable to retain private counsel, and on May 13, 2002, he asked the court to appoint counsel for him. Judge Clifford appointed Keith DuBay as a special public defender on May 28, 2002.</p>\n<p id=\"b126-8\">On October 28, 2003, the defendant asked that DuBay be removed as his counsel, claiming that DuBay\u2019s assistance was ineffective, and requested permission to proceed pro se with the assistance of standby counsel other than DuBay. DuBay represented to Judge O\u2019Keefe his understanding of the defendant\u2019s dissatisfaction with his representation, i.e., trial strategy. The court addressed the defendant extensively to explain the dif<page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"101\">*101</page-number>ferences between pretrial and trial proceedings.<footnotemark>5</footnotemark> Before ruling on the defendant\u2019s motion to represent himself, <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"102\">*102</page-number>the court instructed and canvassed the defendant at length.<footnotemark>6</footnotemark> At the conclusion of the extensive canvass, the <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"103\">*103</page-number>court found that the defendant\u2019s waiver of his right to be represented by counsel at trial was voluntary and understandingly made and that DuBay would continue to advise the defendant as standby counsel.</p>\n<p id=\"b129-6\">We review the defendant\u2019s claim pursuant to the following standard. \u201c[T]he determination of whether there <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"104\">*104</page-number>has been an intelligent waiver of the right to counsel must depend, in each case, upon the particular facts and circumstances surrounding that case, including the background, experience, and conduct of the accused. . . . This important decision rests within the discretion of the trial judge.\u201d (Internal quotation marks omitted.) <em>State </em>v. <em>Rose, </em>73 Conn. App. 702, 706, 809 A.2d 534, cert. denied, 262 Conn. 927, 814 A.2d 382 (2002). Our inquiry, therefore, is to determine whether the court abused its discretion in denying the defendant\u2019s request to discharge his counsel and to proceed pro se.</p>\n<p id=\"b130-6\">\u201cIt is settled law that [b]oth the federal constitution and our state constitution afford a criminal defendant the right to [forgo] the assistance of counsel and to choose instead to represent himself or herself at trial. As a matter of federal constitutional law, the right to self-representation is premised on the structure of the Sixth Amendment, as well as in the English and colonial jurisprudence from which the Amendment emerged. . . . The Connecticut constitution is more explicit, stating directly that [i]n all criminal prosecutions, the accused shall have a right to be heard by himself and by counsel ....</p>\n<p id=\"b130-8\">\u201cAlthough it may be settled law that a criminal defendant has an absolute right to self-representation, that right is not self-executing. A trial court in this state must satisfy itself that several criteria have been met before a criminal defendant properly may be allowed to waive counsel and proceed pro se. . . . Those criteria include a determination by the court (1) that the defendant is competent to waive counsel, and (2) that his waiver is knowing, intelligent and voluntary.\u201d (Citation omitted; internal quotation marks omitted.) Id., 706-707. The defendant claims that the court abused its discretion with respect to both prongs of the waiver test.</p>\n<p id=\"b131-5\"><page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"105\">*105</page-number>In this case, defended under the theory that LaRosa\u2019s complaint was one in a series of accusations that she had made, which were intended to ruin the defendant\u2019s reputation,<footnotemark>7</footnotemark> we bear in mind the following quotation. \u201cOur Supreme Court has held that [t]he right to appear pro se exists to affirm the dignity and autonomy of the accused and to allow the presentation of what may, at least occasionally, be the accused\u2019s best possible defense. ... It is also consistent with the ideal of due process as an expression of fundamental fairness. <em>To force a lawyer on a defendant can only lead him to believe that the law contrives against him. </em>\u201d (Emphasis added; internal quotation marks omitted.) <em>State </em>v. <em>Flanagan, </em>93 Conn. App. 458, 482, 890 A.2d 123 (2006) <em>(Flynn, J., </em>dissenting); see also <em>McKaskle </em>v. <em>Wiggins, </em>465 U.S. 168, 176-77, 104 S. Ct. 944, 79 L. Ed. 2d 122 (1984); <em>Faretta </em>v. <em>California, </em>422 U.S. 806, 834, 95 S. Ct. 2525, 45 L. Ed. 2d 562 (1975).</p>\n<p id=\"b131-6\">A</p>\n<p id=\"b131-7\">Competent to Waive Assistance of Counsel</p>\n<p id=\"b131-8\">The defendant\u2019s first claim is that Judge O\u2019Keefe improperly granted his request to represent himself because the defendant was unable to consult counsel with a reasonable degree of rational understanding of the proceedings against him. The defendant merely <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"106\">*106</page-number>argues, however, that because he was found incompetent to stand trial at one stage of the proceedings, the court should have known that he was incompetent to represent himself.<footnotemark>8</footnotemark> We disagree with the defendant\u2019s claim.</p>\n<p id=\"b132-6\">\u201cA defendant is deemed competent to waive counsel when it is shown that he has sufficient present ability to consult with his lawyer with a reasonable degree of rational understanding and has a rational as well as factual understanding of the proceedings against him.\u201d (Internal quotation marks omitted.) <em>State </em>v. <em>Rose, </em>supra, 73 Conn. App. 707. \u201c[T]he competence that is required of a defendant seeking to waive his right to counsel is the competence to <em>waive the right, </em>not the competence to represent himself. In <em>Faretta </em>v. <em>California, </em>[supra, 422 U.S. 806], we held that a defendant choosing self-representation must do so \u2018competently and intelligently,\u2019 . . . but we made it clear that the defendant\u2019s \u2018technical legal knowledge\u2019 is \u2018not relevant\u2019 to the determination whether he is competent to waive his right to counsel . . . and we emphasized that although the defendant \u2018may conduct his own defense ultimately to his own detriment, his choice must be honored,\u2019 .... Thus, while \u2018[i]t is undeniable that in most criminal prosecutions defendants could better defend with counsel\u2019s guidance than by their own unskilled efforts,\u2019 . . . a criminal defendant\u2019s ability to represent himself has no bearing upon his competence to <em>choose </em>self-representation.\u201d (Citations omitted; emphasis in original.) <em>Godinez </em>v. <em>Moran, </em>509 U.S. 389, 399-400, 113 S. Ct. 2680, 125 L. Ed. 2d 321 (1993).</p>\n<p id=\"b132-7\">\u201cIt is undisputed that an accused who is competent to stand trial also is competent to waive constitutional <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"107\">*107</page-number>rights.\u201d <em>State </em>v. <em>Ouellette, </em>271 Conn. 740, 752-53, 859 A.2d 907 (2004). Pursuant to <em>Godinez, </em>\u201cthe same standard used to determine competency to stand trial also applies to determine competency to plead guilty or to waive the right to counsel. The decision is grounded in two posited equivalencies: (1) that the decision to plead guilty is equivalent to the sum total of decisions a defendant would be required to make at trial; and (2) that the competency required to waive the right to counsel is equivalent to the competency required to waive other constitutional rights incident to a guilty plea. . . . The result of the transitive analysis employed by the [United States Supreme Court] is that any criminal defendant who has been found competent to stand trial, ipso facto, is competent to waive the right to counsel as a matter of federal constitutional law.\u201d (Citations omitted.) <em>State </em>v. <em>Day, </em>233 Conn. 813, 823-24, 661 A.2d 539 (1995).</p>\n<p id=\"b133-6\">As in <em>Day, </em>the defendant here never claimed that he was incompetent to stand trial before, during or after the proceeding before Judge O\u2019Keefe on his request to represent himself. The record discloses that during the competency proceedings, first before Judge Gilardi and then before Judge Clifford, the defendant argued that he was competent to stand trial.<footnotemark>9</footnotemark> Furthermore, the defendant never has claimed that Judge Clifford\u2019s finding that he had been restored to competency was in error. On appeal, the defendant merely claims that because he was found incompetent to stand trial at one stage of the proceedings, but subsequently found competent to stand trial at another stage, Judge O\u2019Keefe should have known that he was incompetent to represent himself.</p>\n<p id=\"b134-5\"><page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"108\">*108</page-number>\u201cThe provisions of \u00a7 54-56d state that if it appears that the defendant is not competent, and if the trial court finds that a request for a competency evaluation is justified, the court must order a competency examination. We have interpreted this standard as requiring a competency evaluation any time a reasonable doubt is raised regarding the defendant\u2019s competency. ... To establish such reasonable doubt, the defendant must present substantial evidence, not merely allegations, that he is incompetent.\u201d (Citation omitted; internal quotation marks omitted.) <em>State </em>v. <em>Ross, </em>269 Conn. 213, 272, 849 A.2d 648 (2004). \u201cEvidence is substantial if it raises a reasonable doubt about the defendant\u2019s competency . . . .\u201d (Internal quotation marks omitted.) Id. \u201c[A] defendant is not competent if he is unable to understand the proceedings against him or to assist in his own defense.\u201d General Statutes \u00a7 54-56d (a).</p>\n<p id=\"b134-6\">Neither in the trial court nor on appeal has the defendant presented any evidence, let alone substantial evidence, that he was unable to understand the nature of the proceedings against him at the time the court granted his request to represent himself. He addressed the court civilly, and his responses were coherent. His claim that he lacked the ability to consult with his standby counsel with a reasonable degree of rational understanding is belied by his response to the court when it was instructing him when to consult with counsel. The defendant himself supplied the information. The defendant did not need to consult counsel about strategy but on \u201c[procedures of court.\u201d See footnote 6. The defendant also responded affirmatively when asked if he had a theory of the case, if he understood that he did not have to testify and if he could abide by the court\u2019s rulings. Id. The defendant understood that he was going to be opposed by a competent attorney. Most tellingly, when the court told him that objective observers think it is not wise for a person to represent <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"109\">*109</page-number>himself, the defendant responded, \u201cYou are probably right.\u201d Id.</p>\n<p id=\"b135-6\">Our analysis of the defendant\u2019s claim is similar to that of our Supreme Court in <em>State </em>v. <em>Wolff, </em>237 Conn. 633, 678 A.2d 1369 (1996) (defendant claimed court aware of prior psychiatric history and crimes he was accused of involved irrational behavior). \u201cThe competence that is required for a defendant\u2019s waiver of counsel to be valid is not . . . the competence to <em>represent himself </em>but is, rather, the competence to <em>waive the right </em>to counsel. . . . Thus, while it is undeniable that in most criminal prosecutions defendants could better defend with <em>counsel\u2019s </em>guidance than by their own unskilled efforts ... a criminal defendant\u2019s ability to represent himself has no bearing upon his competence to <em>choose </em>self-representation.\u201d (Citation omitted; emphasis in original; internal quotation marks omitted.) Id., 667. Although the defendant may have interrupted the court when it canvassed him, he gave rational and coherent responses to the court\u2019s questions. See id., 665. Over a period of years subsequent to his rehabilitation, the defendant appeared before a number of judges, worked with counsel, and interacted with the prosecutor and others in the criminal justice system. No one suggested that he again had become incompetent to stand trial.</p>\n<p id=\"b135-7\">On the basis of the record and the defendant\u2019s failure to question his competency to stand trial or to refer to substantial evidence that he did not understand the nature of the proceedings against him, we conclude that he was competent to waive his right to the assistance of counsel and that the court did not abuse its discretion in granting his motion to represent himself.</p>\n<p id=\"b135-8\">B</p>\n<p id=\"b135-9\">Knowing, Intelligent and Voluntary Waiver</p>\n<p id=\"b135-10\">The defendant claims that his waiver of the right to be represented by counsel was not knowingly and <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"110\">*110</page-number>intelligently made because he \u201cdid not comprehend the essence of the case against him.\u201d We are not persuaded.</p>\n<p id=\"b136-6\">\u201c[Practice Book \u00a7 44-3] was adopted in order to implement the right of a defendant in a criminal case to act as his own attorney .... Before a trial court may accept a defendant\u2019s waiver of counsel, it must conduct an inquiry in accordance with [Practice Book \u00a7 44-3], in order to satisfy itself that the defendant\u2019s decision to waive counsel is knowingly and intelligently made. . . . Although it may be settled that a criminal defendant has an absolute right to self-representation, that right is not self-executing. . . . Claims concerning a violation of Practice Book \u00a7 44-3 frequently occur in the context of a claim that the court improperly permitted the defendant to represent himself.\u201d (Citations omitted; internal quotation marks omitted.) <em>State </em>v. <em>Flanagan, </em>supra, 93 Conn. App. 472.<footnotemark>10</footnotemark></p>\n<p id=\"b136-7\">\u201cThe right to counsel and the right to self-representation present mutually exclusive alternatives. A criminal defendant has a constitutionally protected interest in each, but since the two rights cannot be exercised simultaneously, a defendant must choose between them. When the right to have competent counsel ceases as a result of a sufficient waiver, the right of self-representation begins. . . . Put another way, a defendant <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"111\">*111</page-number>properly exercises his right to self-representation by knowingly and intelligently waiving his right to representation by counsel. . . . When an accused manages his own defense, he relinquishes, as a purely factual matter, many of the traditional benefits associated with the right to counsel. For this reason, in order to represent himself, the accused must knowingly and intelligently [forgo] those relinquished benefits. . . . The state bears the burden of demonstrating that the defendant knowingly and intelligently waived his right to counsel.\u201d (Citations omitted; internal quotation marks omitted.) <em>State </em>v. <em>Diaz, </em>274 Conn. 818, 828-29, 878 A.2d 1078 (2005).</p>\n<p id=\"b137-6\">\u201c[A] defendant need not . . . have the skill and experience of a lawyer in order competently and intelligently to choose self-representation .... Rather, a record that affirmatively shows that [he] was literate, competent, and understanding, and that he was voluntarily exercising his informed free will sufficiently supports a waiver. . . . The nature of the inquiry that must be conducted to substantiate an effective waiver has been explicitly articulated in decisions by various federal courts of appeals. See, e.g., <em>United States </em>v. <em>Cash, </em>47 F.3d 1083, 1088 (11th Cir. 1995) (court must inform defendant of charges, included offenses and possible range of punishment); <em>United States </em>v. <em>Hurtado, </em>47 F.3d 577, 583 [2d Cir.] (factors determining valid waiver include whether defendant understood that he had choice between proceeding pro se and with assigned counsel, understood advantages of having trained counsel, and had capacity to make intelligent choice) [cert. denied, 516 U.S. 903, 116 S. Ct. 266, 133 L. Ed. 2d 188 (1995)]; <em>United States </em>v. <em>Van Krieken, </em>39 F.3d 227, 229 (9th Cir. 1994) (defendant must be aware of nature of charges against him, possible penalties and disadvantages of self-representation); <em>Government of Virgin Islands </em>v. <em>James, </em>934 F.2d 468, 471 (3d Cir. 1991) <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"112\">*112</page-number>(waiver must be made with apprehension of nature of charges, statutory offenses included within them, range of allowable punishments thereunder, possible defenses to charges, circumstances in mitigation thereof, and all other facts essential to broad understanding of whole matter); <em>United States </em>v. <em>Silkwood, </em>893 F.2d 245, 249 (10th Cir. 1989) (same) [cert. denied, 496 U.S. 908, 110 S. Ct. 2593, 110 L. Ed. 2d 274 (1990)]; <em>United States </em>v. <em>McDowell, </em>814 F.2d 245, 251 [6th Cir.] (model inquiry includes questioning about defendant\u2019s legal background, knowledge of crimes charged, possible punishments, familiarity with Federal Rules of Evidence and Criminal Procedure, procedure for testifying and advice that defendant would be better served by representation by trained attorney) [cert. denied, 484 U.S. 980, 108 S. Ct. 478, 98 L. Ed. 2d 781 (1987)]. . . .</p>\n<p id=\"b138-6\">\u201cThe defendant, however, does not possess a constitutional right to a specifically formulated canvass [with respect to this inquiry]. His constitutional right is not violated as long as the court\u2019s canvass, whatever its form, is sufficient to establish that the defendant\u2019s waiver was voluntary and knowing. ... In other words, the court may accept a waiver of the right to counsel without specifically questioning a defendant on each of the factors listed in Practice Book \u00a7 [44-3] if the record is sufficient to establish that the waiver is voluntary and knowing.\u201d (Citation omitted; internal quotation marks omitted.) <em>State </em>v. <em>Diaz, </em>supra, 274 Conn. 829-31.</p>\n<p id=\"b138-7\">The defendant\u2019s claim in his appeal is that his waiver of the right to counsel was not knowingly and intelligently made because he did not comprehend the <em>essence </em>of the case against him. The word essence is not used in Practice Book \u00a7 44-3, and the defendant has not explained what that word means in the context of his claim or provided any authority to support his claim.<footnotemark>11</footnotemark> <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"113\">*113</page-number>We assume that the defendant\u2019s claim falls within Practice Book \u00a7 44-3 (3), concerning his comprehension of the nature of the charges against him. The transcript reveals that Judge O\u2019Keefe canvassed the defendant as to his comprehension of the case against him. See footnote 6.</p>\n<p id=\"b139-6\">During the court\u2019s canvass, the defendant was asked, \u201cAnd you\u2019ve been represented by counsel for a long time, and you\u2019ve had numerous discussions with him about the issues in the case and you disagree on trial strategy, correct?\u201d The defendant responded that the court\u2019s statement was correct. \u201cIn general, a trial court may appropriately presume that defense counsel has explained the nature of the offense in sufficient detail. . . . Furthermore, the defendant need not be specifically informed of the particular elements of the crimes charged before being permitted to waive counsel and proceed pro se. In fact . . . perfect comprehension of each element of a criminal charge does not appear to be necessary to a finding of a knowing and intelligent waiver.\u201d (Citation omitted; internal quotation marks omitted.) <em>State </em>v. <em>Bangulescu, </em>80 Conn. App. 26, 45, 832 A.2d 1187, cert. denied, 267 Conn. 907, 840 A.2d 1171 (2003). The defendant also stated that he did not think this was a complicated case. The defendant responded affirmatively that he had a theory of the case and that he knew which witnesses he wanted to call.</p>\n<p id=\"b139-8\">The substance of the charges against the defendant was that he had made a threatening telephone call to LaRosa that caused her to absent herself from the hearing for Tanya Caracoglia. The theory of defense was that LaRosa previously had accused him falsely. If the defendant\u2019s theory were true and evidence to that end properly presented, he very well may have prevailed at trial. The defendant subpoenaed a large number of witnesses to testify about LaRosa\u2019s prior accusations against him. In proffering the evidence, however, the <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"114\">*114</page-number>defendant did not limit the scope of his examination, and therein lay his downfall. He sought to present irrelevant evidence, to conduct trials within a trial, so to speak. The problem the defendant encountered was not his failure to comprehend the nature of the claims against him but his lack of technical skill to defend against those claims.</p>\n<p id=\"b140-6\">\u201cWe harbor no illusions that a defendant\u2019s decision to waive counsel and proceed pro se generally will lead to anything other than disastrous consequences. . . . Nonetheless, the values informing our constitutional structure teach that although [a defendant] may conduct his own defense ultimately to his own detriment, his choice must be honored out of that respect for the individual which is the lifeblood of the law.\u201d (Citation omitted; internal quotation marks omitted.) <em>State </em>v. <em>Day, </em>supra, 233 Conn. 821. In granting the defendant\u2019s motion to proceed pro se, the court honored this fundamental precept of our law.</p>\n<p id=\"b140-7\">Practice Book \u00a7 44-3 protects a defendant from waiving the right to counsel when he does not understand the nature of the charges against him and their consequences. Section 44-3 does not, however, protect a defendant from his poor judgment in failing to heed the court\u2019s warning that representing oneself is something most people consider a bad idea. The defendant himself agreed with that conventional wisdom but declined to follow it. We therefore conclude that the defendant comprehended the nature of the claims against him and knowingly and voluntarily waived his right to counsel.</p>\n<p id=\"b140-8\">II</p>\n<p id=\"b140-9\">The defendant\u2019s second claim is that the court, <em>Holzberg, J., </em>improperly admitted misconduct evidence of a highly inflammatory nature that was more prejudicial <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"115\">*115</page-number>than probative.<footnotemark>12</footnotemark> We decline to review this claim because the defendant induced the error.</p>\n<p id=\"b141-6\">The following facts are relevant to the claim. As we stated in footnote 7, prior to the defendant\u2019s examining the witnesses whom he had subpoenaed before the jury, the court conducted a preliminary hearing on the substance of the defendant\u2019s direct examination and the proffered testimony to determine whether it was admissible. The purpose of the proffered evidence was to demonstrate that LaRosa was biased against the defendant and had accused him falsely in the past.</p>\n<p id=\"b141-7\">One of the subpoenaed witnesses was Stefan Ozga, a teachers\u2019 union representative and former friend of the defendant. Outside the presence of the jury, the defendant asked Ozga whether he, while attending a particular meeting, had heard LaRosa make statements concerning threats from the defendant. Ozga answered that he had not. The defendant then asked Ozga why he had given school officials a statement regarding such <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"116\">*116</page-number>threats if he never had heard LaRosa discuss the threats. Ozga answered, \u201cBecause, Sal, in my presence, you\u2019ve threatened [LaRosa] numerous times that you were going to kill her.\u201d</p>\n<p id=\"b142-6\">The court terminated the defendant\u2019s further inquiry because it concerned irrelevant matters. The court asked the defendant if he wanted to call Ozga as a witness at trial. The defendant responded in the affirmative, whereupon the prosecutor interjected: \u201cHe should be aware that he is opening up some doors that could hurt him.\u201d The court stated: \u201cI know. I am going to advise [the defendant] that you have heard some of the questions that Mr. Ozga has responded to, including prior threats. So, you\u2019re representing yourself. It is your decision. I am not your lawyer.\u201d The defendant said it was his decision to call Ozga.</p>\n<p id=\"b142-7\">Shortly thereafter, the court again warned the defendant of the dangers inherent in Ozga\u2019s testimony: \u201cStefan Ozga is coming back at your request. I am going to advise you, again ... I believe you . . . embark on a very perilous course if you call Mr. Ozga back because you will open the door to the possible admission of prior threats to [LaRosa]. So, I suggest you think long and hard about whether it is an intelligent strategy for you to call Mr. Ozga back, given what he will testify.\u201d The defendant replied that Ozga \u201cwill be back.\u201d</p>\n<p id=\"b142-8\">After the luncheon recess, the court addressed the defendant and the prosecutor again with regard to Ozga\u2019s testimony. The court summarized Ozga\u2019s testimony concerning the threats he had heard the defendant make and reiterated the warning to the defendant. The court then said that it would advise Ozga that he was not to volunteer information about the threats he had heard the defendant make.<footnotemark>13</footnotemark> The prosecutor <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"117\">*117</page-number>informed the court that he would not cross-examine Ozga about threats he had heard the defendant make unless the defendant opened the door to such an inquiry. The court ordered the prosecutor to advise it outside the presence of the jury if he intended to conduct such an inquiry so that the court could evaluate whether the testimony\u2019s probative value outweighed its prejudicial effect.</p>\n<p id=\"b143-6\">The defendant examined Ozga in front of the jury, focusing on a statement Ozga had provided to school officials. Ozga testified that LaRosa did not tell him that the defendant was going to kill her. The defendant\u2019s examination of Ozga continued, in part:</p>\n<blockquote id=\"b143-7\">\u201c[The Defendant]: Okay. Mr. Ozga, did you or did [a school official] tell you that I . . . was going to kill [LaRosa]?</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b143-8\">\u201c[The Witness]: No. The situation wasn\u2019t that way. ... I told her that because you were upset about what had happened with the suspension, with the accusation, the allegations that were made. I told her, okay, you know how Sal is. Be careful. Before I know it, [a school official] calls me for a statement. He said that [LaRosa] went to him and said that I had overheard X, Y and Z, and he wanted a statement from . . . me, and that\u2019s the statement I gave.</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b143-9\">\u201c[The Defendant]: And, at this point in time, you\u2019re called by [the school official] to give a statement, and the statement you gave, actually, is that at no way that you ever heard [the defendant] making physical threat[s] about [LaRosa]. . . . [The defendant\u2019s] intent <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"118\">*118</page-number>was to embarrass [LaRosa] politically, professionally and personally?</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b144-6\">\u201c[The Witness]: Well, the statement, also says, \u2018I am going to get [LaRosa],\u2019 and there was all sorts of conversations about what \u2018I\u2019m going to get [LaRosa]\u2019 means.</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b144-7\">* * *</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b144-8\">\u201c[The Defendant]: Can you clarify for the court and for the jury here what was meant by <em>get?</em></blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b144-9\">\u201c[The Witness]: ... I don\u2019t know what . . . you meant by <em>get. </em>Okay. I was downplaying any kind of threats, and you were talking about, \u2018I\u2019m going to politically embarrass her. I\u2019m going to politically do this to her. I\u2019m going to personally embarrass her. . . .\u2019</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b144-10\">\u201c[The Defendant]: All right. But there was no way that I threatened to kill her. It was in her mind. That\u2019s what you said here in your statement \u2014 that we had a discussion about [the defendant\u2019s] threats together. We talked about it, what <em>get </em>her means. And I told [the school official] that [the defendant] intended to embarrass \u2014 to embarrass politically, professionally and personally. So, that\u2019s what we mean by <em>get.</em></blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b144-11\">\u201c[The Witness]: That\u2019s what I told [the school official].\u201d (Emphasis added.)</blockquote>\n<p id=\"b144-12\">Soon thereafter, the court concluded the defendant\u2019s examination of Ozga, and the prosecutor asked to be heard outside the presence of the jury. He argued that although the defendant had been advised of the risks associated with posing certain questions to Ozga, the defendant had opened the door permitting the state to ask Ozga to clarify what he knew about threats the defendant had made to LaRosa. The court asked the state for a proffer of the evidence. The questions posed by the state to Ozga were whether the defendant ever threatened LaRosa in his presence, how many times <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"119\">*119</page-number>and the nature of the threats. Ozga responded that the defendant said that he was going to kill her, and that she had ruined his life and his family. The court asked Ozga whether the defendant\u2019s words were threats or statements. Ozga responded: \u201cOver the years, until, Your Honor, [the defendant] assaulted me. It was [the defendant]. You know how [the defendant] is. He gets hot under the collar. He\u2019s a loose cannon. It never materialized into anything. Okay. But he was getting progressively worse at it.\u201d</p>\n<p id=\"b145-6\">The court asked the state to explain the relevance of its questioning. The prosecutor argued that the defendant had opened the door to past threats and that the defendant\u2019s language demonstrated a common scheme. The state anticipated that the defendant would argue to the jury that if he never made prior threats, the threat alleged in the charges here had not occurred. The court explained that it had to consider whether the line of inquiry was more prejudicial than probative. The court did not want to cause a mistrial or cause reversible error. The court reserved judgment until after the luncheon recess. After the recess, the court continued to query Ozga about the nature, time and intensity of the defendant\u2019s threats to eveiyone involved with the issue of the defendant\u2019s employment. The court initially ruled that the admission of the evidence would create reversible error. The defendant objected to the admission of the evidence, as well. The prosecutor then suggested, as an alternative to the proposed cross-examination, that some portions of Ozga\u2019s testimony be stricken because it could be construed by the jury that the defendant never had threatened LaRosa with bodily injury but with political retaliation. The defendant opposed the striking of that portion of Ozga\u2019s testimony because it proved his point. The defendant stated that he never threatened to kill LaRosa, he just wanted to embarrass her publicly. The following colloquy transpired:</p>\n<blockquote id=\"b146-5\"><page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"120\">*120</page-number>\u201cThe Court: Let me ask you. Is it your claim \u2014 is it going to be your argument to the jury that . . . LaRosa . . . has . . . made unfounded threats, has reported unfounded threats?</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b146-6\">\u201c[The Defendant]: All the time, Your Honor.</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b146-7\">\u201cThe Court: Okay. Then, I am going to allow this testimony. It\u2019s relevant. ... If that\u2019s going to be your theory, then, the state can rebut that \u2014 that there have been other occasions in which there have been different types of threats. . . . Now, I just want to make sure . . . when you argue to the jury tomorrow, [it] is that . . . LaRosa on previous occasions has made inaccurate or misleading or false threats that you were going to harm her?</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b146-8\">\u201c[The Defendant]: Correct, Your Honor.</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b146-9\">\u201cThe Court: And this is just one in a series of such false threats?</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b146-10\">\u201c[The Defendant]: Yes, Your Honor.</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b146-11\">\u201cThe Court: Okay. Well, then, under those circumstances, it seems to me it\u2019s relevant for the state to address the claim by hearing from Mr. Ozga as to the nature of the threats, and we\u2019ll let the jury decide. . . . Again, I think you\u2019ve opened up a Pandora\u2019s box that you may regret, but having opened it, the state is fairly entitled to respond.\u201d</blockquote>\n<p id=\"b146-12\">On cross-examination, the state asked Ozga whether he personally knew of threats the defendant had made to LaRosa. Ozga responded that the defendant had threatened LaRosa on numerous occasions. On redirect examination, the defendant asked Ozga for specific dates that such threats were made. Ozga responded that there were so many he could not recall. He also testified, in response to questions from the defendant, <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"121\">*121</page-number>that over time, the defendant became more threatening, animated and hostile.</p>\n<p id=\"b147-6\">The defendant also recalled LaRosa as his witness. He claims that the court improperly permitted her to testify that she was frightened of the defendant and that she took his threats to be of a physical, not a professional or political, nature.</p>\n<p id=\"b147-7\">On appeal, the defendant claims that the court committed reversible error by admitting the highly inflammatory testimony of Ozga and LaRosa. The defendant failed to preserve the claim and seeks to prevail pursuant to <em>State </em>v. <em>Golding, </em>supra, 213 Conn. 239-40, or under the plain error doctrine. See Practice Book \u00a7 60-5. We decline to review his claim, not only because the defendant failed to brief the claim adequately under either doctrine, but also because the defendant induced the claimed error. <em>Guglielmo </em>v. <em>Klausner Supply Co., </em>158 Conn. 308, 317, 259 A.2d 608 (1969). Our Supreme Court has held that review of induced, unpreserved error is not permissible under <em>Golding. </em>See <em>State </em>v. <em>Cruz, </em>269 Conn. 97, 106, 848 A.2d 445 (2004).</p>\n<p id=\"b147-8\">\u201cThe term induced error, or invited error, has been defined as [a]n error that a party cannot complain of on appeal because the party, through conduct, encouraged or prompted the trial court to make the erroneous ruling. ... it is well established that a party who induces an error cannot be heard to later complain about the error. . . . [T]o allow [a] defendant to seek reversal [after] ... his trial strategy failed would amount to allowing him to induce potentially harmful error, and then ambush the state [and the trial court] with that claim on appeal.\u201d (Internal quotation marks omitted.) <em>State </em>v. <em>DiLoreto, </em>88 Conn. App. 393, 397-98, 870 A.2d 1095 (2005).</p>\n<p id=\"b147-9\">In this case, the defendant tried the case on the theory that LaRosa previously had made false claims of threat<page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"122\">*122</page-number>ening against him. Despite warnings from the court and concerns expressed by the state, the defendant questioned Ozga about prior instances in which LaRosa had made reports of threats from the defendant and opened the door for the state to inquire as to the nature of those threats. The court was entitled to rely on the defendant\u2019s theory of prior falsehoods in ruling on the admissibility of testimony from Ozga and LaRosa that the defendant previously had threatened to harm her. See <em>Farina </em>v. <em>Modzelewski, </em>94 Conn. App. 203, 207, 891 A.2d 138 (2006). \u201c[A]ction induced by an appellant cannot be made a ground of error.\u201d (Internal quotation marks omitted.) Id.</p>\n<p id=\"b148-4\">Ill</p>\n<p id=\"b148-5\">The defendant\u2019s third claim is that it was improper under the sixth amendment to the United States constitution and Practice Book \u00a7 43-41 for the court, <em>O\u2019Keefe, J., </em>not to dismiss the charges against him because he was denied the right to a speedy trial. The defendant\u2019s claim lacks merit.</p>\n<p id=\"b148-6\">In his appellate brief, the defendant claims that he preserved his claim when he asked Judge O\u2019Keefe on October 28, 2003, to dismiss the charges against him. Our review of the transcript of the proceedings before the court on that date reveals the following facts. The defendant presented the court with oral motions to dismiss his counsel, DuBay, to grant a speedy trial and to dismiss the charges. The majority of the court\u2019s time was focused on the defendant\u2019s motion to dismiss counsel and to represent himself with the assistance of standby counsel. The defendant also voiced displeasure that he had not been granted a speedy trial. On the court\u2019s granting the defendant\u2019s motion to dismiss DuBay as counsel, the court granted the defendant\u2019s request for a speedy trial.<footnotemark>14</footnotemark> Before the conclusion of <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"123\">*123</page-number>the proceedings, the defendant indicated that there was a motion to dismiss the charges for \u201cthirty-eight, thirty-seven and seventy-three.\u201d<footnotemark>15</footnotemark> The court told the defendant that the motion to dismiss did not have to be decided at that time and could be addressed by the judge who tried the case, including the charges at issue here. The defendant responded, \u201cOkay.\u201d The defendant has not brought to our attention facts that would indicate that he asked the trial court, Judge Holzberg, to rule on the motion to dismiss, and we can find no written motion to dismiss signed by the defendant in the court\u2019s file.</p>\n<p id=\"b149-6\">Our review of the proceedings before Judge Holzberg discloses that before the jury panel was sworn in for voir dire, he reviewed the charges against the defendant with the state and asked if there were preliminary matters the defendant wanted him to review. At that time, the defendant voiced a concern as to whether the charges had been filed within the applicable statute of limitations. The court assured him that the charges were filed timely. The court also informed the defendant: \u201cIf your claim concerns a speedy trial, why is it that you were arrested on or about January 1, 2000, and the trial is now occurring in November of 2003. That is separate and independent from the statute of limitations. You filed your speedy trial motion, of course, a few weeks ago, which is why we are here today so that you can have a speedy trial.\u201d The defendant then moved on to another matter.</p>\n<p id=\"b149-7\">The defendant claims that the issue has been preserved for our review, but that if it has not, that he is entitled to <em>Golding </em>review.<footnotemark>16</footnotemark> The defendant did not, <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"124\">*124</page-number>however, brief his <em>Golding </em>claim. We cannot determine whether the record is adequate for our review because we cannot find (1) a copy of the defendant\u2019s motion to dismiss in the file and (2) any record that his motion to dismiss was brought before Judge Holzberg for a ruling. We are unable to determine from the record why the defendant failed to bring the motion to Judge Holzberg\u2019s attention, i.e., an oversight or withdrawal of the motion. The defendant also has not demonstrated that Judge O\u2019Keefe\u2019s decision to let the trial judge address the motion to dismiss the charges is of constitutional magnitude. For these reasons, the defendant\u2019s claim does not merit review.</p>\n<p id=\"b150-4\">IV</p>\n<p id=\"b150-5\">The defendant\u2019s fourth claim is that the prosecutor engaged in a pattern of egregious misconduct that deprived him of a fair trial. The defendant cannot prevail on his claim.</p>\n<p id=\"b150-6\">The defendant failed to object to what he claims were inappropriate remarks the prosecutor made during the state\u2019s final argument. Initially, the defendant asked us to review his claims pursuant to <em>Golding, </em>but in his reply brief he sought the appropriate standard of review pursuant to <em>State </em>v. <em>Stevenson, </em>269 Conn. 563, 849 A.2d 626 (2004). \u201cWe conduct a two step inquiry in analyzing claims of prosecutorial misconduct. The two steps are separate and distinct: (1) whether misconduct occurred in the first instance; and (2) whether that misconduct deprived a defendant of his due process right to a fair trial.\u201d (Internal quotation marks omitted.) <em>State </em>v. <em>Mulero, </em>91 Conn. App. 509, 516, 881 A.2d 1039 (2005), cert. denied, 277 Conn. 912, 895 A.2d 792 (2006), quoting <em>State </em>v. <em>Stevenson, </em>supra, 572.</p>\n<p id=\"b151-5\"><page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"125\">*125</page-number>\u201cThe issue is whether the prosecutor\u2019s conduct so infected the trial with unfairness as to make the resulting conviction a denial of due process. . . . [The court] must view the prosecutor\u2019s comments in the context of the entire trial. <em>[State </em>v. <em>Stevenson, </em>supra, 269 Conn. 571]. The factors to be considered in assessing the prosecutor\u2019s actions include the extent to which the misconduct was invited by defense conduct or argument. . . . the severity of the misconduct . . . the frequency of the misconduct . . . the centrality of the misconduct to the critical issues in the case . . . the strength of the curative measures adopted . . . and the strength of the state\u2019s case. . . . <em>State </em>v. <em>Williams, </em>204 Conn. 523, 540, 529 A.2d 653 (1987).\u201d (Internal quotation marks omitted.) <em>State </em>v. <em>Mulero, </em>supra, 91 Conn. App. 516-17.</p>\n<p id=\"b151-6\">The defendant has cited three statements by the prosecutor that he claims were misconduct.<footnotemark>17</footnotemark> Before addressing the statements to determine whether they were misconduct, we note that when addressing the jury, counsel is permitted to argue the facts that are in evidence and the reasonable inferences that can be drawn from them. Id., 520. On the basis of our review of the three incidents in which the defendant claims the prosecutor was guilty of misconduct, we conclude that each comment had a basis in the evidence presented at trial and that there was, in fact, no misconduct.</p>\n<p id=\"b151-7\">The defendant claims that the prosecutor improperly called Tanya Caracoglia a liar and stated that it appeared that she had followed in her father\u2019s footsteps. The defendant claims that those statements were unfair because they concerned his principal witness. The credibility of any witness, no matter how central to the prosecution or the defense, is always an appropriate <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"126\">*126</page-number>matter for final argument. Given the sad circumstances of this case, i.e., Tanya Caracoglia\u2019s intense loyalty to the defendant, which resulted in criminal charges, the defendant personally may have perceived the prosecutor\u2019s comments as cruel. Nonetheless, Tanya Caracoglia admitted that at the time the court granted her accelerated rehabilitation, she did not truthfully say that she would offer LaRosa a sincere apology for striking her. Tanya Caracoglia testified that her apology was not sincere. Although appellate courts frown on counsel\u2019s expression of personal opinion as to the credibility of a witness, the prosecutor in this case did not state a personal opinion, and his comments were grounded firmly in Tanya Caracoglia\u2019s testimony. See <em>State </em>v. <em>Oehman, </em>212 Conn. 325, 334, 562 A.2d 493 (1989).</p>\n<p id=\"b152-6\">The defendant claims that the prosecutor shifted the burden of proof by asking the jury to focus on the defendant\u2019s examination of LaRosa and whether he had asked her any questions having to do with the telephone call of September 11, 1999. The prosecutor pointed out that the defendant\u2019s questions pertained to matters unrelated to the charges at hand. We do not see, and the defendant has not explained, how the prosecutor\u2019s drawing the jury\u2019s attention to these facts shifted the state\u2019s burden of proof.</p>\n<p id=\"b152-7\">Finally, the defendant claims that the prosecutor assailed his character by suggesting that LaRosa had reason to fear him. In asking the jury to assess LaRosa\u2019s credibility, the prosecutor asked the jury to consider that she was not cross-examined by third party counsel but by the defendant, the very man who telephoned her on September 11,1999. The case cited by the defendant to support his claim, <em>Dudley </em>v. <em>Duckworth, </em>854 F.2d 967 (7th Cir. 1988), cert. denied, 490 U.S. 1011, 109 S. Ct. 1655, 104 L. Ed. 2d 169 (1989), is distinguishable. In <em>Dudley, </em>the prosecutor asked improper questions of the codefendant to link the defendant in that case to <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"127\">*127</page-number>other wrongdoing. Id., 969, 972. Here, the prosecutor did not improperly elicit evidence, but made use of the facts in evidence to influence the jury\u2019s deliberations, which is wholly proper.</p>\n<p id=\"b153-6\">V</p>\n<p id=\"b153-7\">The defendant\u2019s fifth claim is that the judgment of conviction should be reversed because there was insufficient evidence presented for the jury to find him guilty beyond a reasonable doubt of harassment in the second degree and tampering with a witness. We are not persuaded.</p>\n<p id=\"b153-8\">The defendant failed to move for a judgment of acquittal at the conclusion of the state\u2019s case or before the case was submitted to the jury or to move to set aside the verdict and now seeks to prevail on appeal under <em>Golding. </em>\u201cUnpreserved sufficiency claims are reviewable on appeal because such claims implicate a defendant\u2019s federal constitutional right not to be convicted of a crime upon insufficient proof. . . . Our Supreme Court has stated that <em>Jackson </em>v. <em>Virginia, </em>[443 U.S. 307, 99 S. Ct. 2781, 61 L. Ed. 2d 560 (1979)], compels the conclusion that any defendant found guilty on the basis of insufficient evidence has been deprived of a constitutional right, and would therefore necessarily meet the four prongs of <em>[Golding], . . . </em>Thus . . . there is no practical reason for engaging in a <em>Golding </em>analysis of a claim based on the sufficiency of the evidence . . . .\u201d (Internal quotation marks omitted.) <em>State </em>v. <em>Ashe, </em>74 Conn. App. 511, 514, 812 A.2d 194, cert. denied, 262 Conn. 949, 817 A.2d 108 (2003).</p>\n<p id=\"b153-9\">\u201cIn reviewing a sufficiency of the evidence claim, we apply a two-part test. First, we construe the evidence in the light most favorable to sustaining the verdict. Second, we determine whether upon the facts so construed and the inferences reasonably drawn therefrom the [trier of fact] reasonably could have concluded that <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"128\">*128</page-number>the cumulative force of the evidence established guilt beyond a reasonable doubt. ... In evaluating evidence, the trier of fact is not required to accept as dispositive those inferences that are consistent with the defendant\u2019s innocence. . . . The trier may draw whatever inferences from the evidence or facts established by the evidence it deems to be reasonable and logical. . . . This does not require that each subordinate conclusion established by or inferred from the evidence, or even from other inferences, be proved beyond a reasonable doubt . . . because [our Supreme Court] has held that a [trier\u2019s] factual inferences that support a guilty verdict need only be reasonable.\u201d (Internal quotation marks omitted.) <em>State </em>v. <em>Farnum, </em>275 Conn. 26, 32, 878 A.2d 1095 (2005).</p>\n<p id=\"b154-6\">The substance of the defendant\u2019s argument supporting his claim of insufficient evidence is not that the state failed to prove beyond a reasonable doubt an element of either of the charges against him but that the jury chose to believe LaRosa. We have said many times that it is not the province of appellate courts to make determinations of credibility, as that is the right and purpose of the jury. See, e.g., <em>State </em>v. <em>Cais, </em>59 Conn. App. 186, 189, 754 A.2d 858 (2000). LaRosa linked the defendant to the anonymous threatening call on the basis of his accent, which the defendant argues is not unique. He further argues that the state failed to substantiate LaRosa\u2019s testimony with telephone records.

The proffered testimony concerned irrelevant events that had occurred as much as fifteen years prior to September, 1999. In essence, it appears that the defendant was attempting to demonstrate that LaRosa falsely had accused him of wrongdoing that resulted in his losing his employment at Middletown High School. Throughout the preliminary hearing, the court guided and instructed the defendant as to which questions were permissible, crafted the form of questions and tightly controlled his inquiry to protect the potential witnesses.
