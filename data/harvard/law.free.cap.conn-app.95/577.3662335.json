The defendant was convicted, following a jury trial, of three counts of manslaughter in the first degree in violation of General Statutes \u00a7 53a-55 (a) (3) and one count of assault in the third degree in <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"579\">*579</page-number>violation of General Statutes \u00a7 53a-61.<footnotemark>1</footnotemark> <em>State </em>v. <em>Bermudez, </em>79 Conn. App. 275, 276-77, 830 A.2d 288 (2003), rev\u2019d, 274 Conn. 581, 876 A.2d 1162 (2005).</p>\n<p id=\"b605-6\">In his first appeal, the defendant claimed that \u201c(1) the evidence was insufficient to sustain his conviction, (2) the prosecutor engaged in misconduct that violated the defendant\u2019s right to a fair trial, (3) the court improperly excluded evidence of a witness\u2019 prior inconsistent statements, (4) the court improperly admitted into evidence the defendant\u2019s hospital records and (5) the court violated the defendant\u2019s right to a fair trial by overemphasizing the jury instructions on manslaughter in the first degree.\u201d Id., 277. In our decision, we concluded that the evidence was sufficient to sustain the defendant\u2019s conviction. Id., 282. We determined, however, that the prosecutor had engaged in misconduct that deprived the defendant of his constitutional right to a fair trial and reversed the judgment. Id., 289. We further held that the court improperly overemphasized the jury instructions on manslaughter in the first degree. Id., 277 n.3.</p>\n<p id=\"b605-7\">Our Supreme Court granted the state\u2019s petition for certification to appeal, limited to the issues: \u201cDid the Appellate Court properly conclude that: (1) prosecutorial misconduct deprived the defendant of a fair trial; and (2) the trial court improperly overemphasized the charge of manslaughter in the first degree in its instructions to the jury?\u201d (Internal quotation marks omitted.) <em>State </em>v. <em>Bermudez, </em>266 Conn. 921, 835 A.2d 61 (2003). Our Supreme Court ultimately concluded that this court improperly reversed the judgment on the ground of prosecutorial misconduct and that the trial court properly instructed the jury on manslaughter in the first degree. <em>State </em>v. <em>Bermudez, </em>supra, 274 Conn. 602-605. <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"580\">*580</page-number>The judgment of this court was reversed and the case remanded with direction to consider the defendant\u2019s remaining claims on appeal. Id., 605. At the instruction of our Supreme Court, we now consider whether the trial court improperly (1) excluded evidence of a witness\u2019 prior inconsistent statements and (2) admitted the defendant\u2019s hospital records into evidence.<footnotemark>2</footnotemark> We affirm the judgment of the trial court.</p>\n<p id=\"b606-6\">The facts underlying the defendant\u2019s conviction were set out at length in <em>State </em>v. <em>Bermudez, </em>supra, 79 Conn. App. 275. \u201cAt approximately 4 a.m., on June 23, 2000, a Chevrolet Tracker was stopped at a red traffic signal on Chase Avenue in Waterbury. The vehicle the defendant was driving approached the traffic light traveling in the same direction as the Tracker. It struck the rear end of the Tracker at a speed of more than ninety miles per hour. The occupants of the Tracker, Stacy Maia and Nicolina Barat\u00eda, both died as a result of the collision. Cecilio Quinones, a passenger in the front seat of the defendant\u2019s vehicle, sustained fatal injuries as a result <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"581\">*581</page-number>of the collision. Samuel Tirado, a second passenger in the defendant\u2019s vehicle sustained serious but nonfatal injuries as a result of the collision. It was later determined that the defendant was under the influence of marijuana and phencyclidine, also known as PCP, at the time of the collision.</p>\n<p id=\"b607-6\">\u201cImmediately following the collision, the defendant climbed out of the windshield of his vehicle as the driver\u2019s door would not open. The defendant pulled Quinones from the front seat of the vehicle. The defendant then collapsed next to Quinones on the street.</p>\n<p id=\"b607-7\">\u201cThe defendant was arrested on an information dated October 2, 2000. The defendant was charged with three counts of manslaughter in the first degree in violation of \u00a7 53a-55 (a) (3) and one count of assault in the first degree in violation of General Statutes \u00a7 53a-59 (a) (3). A jury trial began on January 10, 2002. After the state rested, the defendant sought to have all of the charges dismissed and to obtain a judgment of acquittal as to all four counts. The court denied the defendant\u2019s motion for a judgment of acquittal. The defendant was convicted of three counts of manslaughter in the first degree and one count of the lesser included offense of assault in the third degree.\u201d <em>State </em>v. <em>Bermudez, </em>supra, 79 Conn. App. 277-78. Additional facts will be set forth as necessary.</p>\n<p id=\"b607-8\">We now set forth the standard of review applicable to both of the defendant\u2019s claims. \u201cIt is axiomatic that [t]he trial court\u2019s ruling on the admissibility of evidence is entitled to great deference. . . . [T]he trial court has broad discretion in ruling on the admissibility ... of evidence. . . . The trial court\u2019s ruling on evidentiary matters will be overturned only upon a showing of a clear abuse of the court\u2019s discretion. . . . We will make every reasonable presumption in favor of upholding the trial court\u2019s ruling, and only upset it for a manifest abuse <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"582\">*582</page-number>of discretion.\u201d (Internal quotation marks omitted.) <em>State </em>v. <em>William C., </em>267 Conn. 686, 700-701, 841 A.2d 1144 (2004); see also <em>State </em>v. <em>Skakel, </em>276 Conn. 633, 723-24, 888 A.2d 985 (2006).</p>\n<p id=\"b608-6\">I</p>\n<p id=\"b608-7\">The defendant first claims that the court improperly excluded evidence of a witness\u2019 prior inconsistent statements. Specifically, the defendant argues that the court abused its discretion by not allowing him to play an audiotape recording of statements made by Thomas Meier, a lieutenant in the Waterbury fire department, that contained inconsistencies when compared with his testimony. We disagree.</p>\n<p id=\"b608-8\">The following additional facts are necessary for our discussion. The state called Meier as its second witness. Meier testified that at the time of the accident, he was sleeping at the fire station. The sound of the accident awakened him, and he observed two heavily damaged motor vehicles through an open window. Meier dressed quickly and ran downstairs where he alerted the dispatchers about the accident. He then gathered some equipment and proceeded outside to the crash site.</p>\n<p id=\"b608-9\">Meier first went to the victims\u2019 sport utility vehicle and then to the vehicle operated by the defendant. He then went back to the sport utility vehicle and started examining the individuals inside. Meier then noticed that the vehicle driven by the defendant was on fire, so he went inside the fire station for additional help. Meier then ran back to the defendant\u2019s vehicle, where he observed that the passenger had been pulled out. The defendant extensively cross-examined Meier regarding his actions at the accident scene.</p>\n<p id=\"b608-10\">Following this testimony, audio recordings of Meier\u2019s conversations with the dispatcher were discovered and turned over to the defendant. There was a recording <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"583\">*583</page-number>of Meier\u2019s initial statements to the dispatcher while he was at the accident scene and his conversation with the dispatcher that occurred approximately one hour later. The court allowed the defendant to recall Meier for further cross-examination. Meier testified that he might have been \u201ca little excited\u201d when he initially called the dispatcher. Meier was asked several questions regarding his actions at the accident site and what he had told the dispatcher over the radio. He responded that he could not recall and that listening to a tape of the audio recordings could refresh his memory. The court then excused the jury and played the tape for Meier.</p>\n<p id=\"b609-5\">After the jury returned, defense counsel continued his cross-examination of Meier. Meier admitted that his voice did not sound excited on the recording. He also acknowledged that he never specified the number of vehicles involved in the accident to the dispatcher or that he was leaving the firehouse. Meier conceded that he failed to tell the dispatcher that he was responding to the accident scene or that there were any injuries. He agreed that the members of the fire station were not dispatched until six minutes after his initial call and that he was \u201cshocked and dumbfounded\u201d as to the delay.</p>\n<p id=\"b609-6\">The defendant then moved to have the audiotape played before the jury. The court heard argument by counsel on this issue outside the presence of the jury and concluded that the audio recordings were not admissible evidence. The court concluded that the recording of Meier\u2019s statements made at the accident scene would not be played for the jury because Meier admitted to the jury that he made those statements on the recording.<footnotemark>3</footnotemark> With respect to Meier\u2019s later conversa<page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"584\">*584</page-number>tion with the dispatcher, the court determined that some portions of the recordings contained hearsay and that others failed to qualify as impeachment evidence.</p>\n<p id=\"b610-6\">As a preliminary matter, we set forth the applicable legal principles. \u201cImpeachment of a witness by the use of a prior inconsistent statement is proper only if the two statements are in fact inconsistent. . . . Moreover, the inconsistency must be substantial and relate to a material matter. . . . Since the purpose of such evidence is to induce the tribunal to discard the one statement because the witness has also made another statement which cannot at the same time be true . . . the inconsistency must be <em>substantial </em>and relate to a <em>material matter. </em>... In determining whether an inconsistency actually exists, the testimony of the witness as a whole, or the whole impression or effect of what has been said, must be examined. . . . Moreover, statements from which a possible inference of inconsistency may be drawn are insufficient for the purpose of impeachment. . . . The trial court is vested with wide discretion as to what may be admitted as a prior inconsistent statement for impeachment purposes.\u201d (Citations omitted; emphasis added; internal quotation marks omitted.) <em>State </em>v. <em>Richardson, </em>214 Conn. 752, 763-64, 574 A.2d 182 (1990); <em>State </em>v. <em>Abernathy, </em>72 Conn. App. 831, 841, 806 A.2d 1139, cert. denied, 262 Conn. 924, 814 A.2d 379 (2002); see also Conn. Code Evid. \u00a7 6-10.</p>\n<p id=\"b610-7\">With respect to the initial conversations between Meier and the dispatcher, the court did not determine that there were no inconsistencies between his testimony and his prior statements. The court instead concluded that there was no reason to play the audiotape because Meier acknowledged his prior statements. Subsection (c) of \u00a7 6-10 of the Connecticut Code of Evidence provides in relevant part that \u201c[i]f a prior inconsistent statement made by a witness is shown to <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"585\">*585</page-number>or if the contents of the statement are disclosed to the witness at the time the witness testifies, and <em>if the witness admits to making the statement, extrinsic evidence of the statement is inadmissible, except in the discretion of the court. . . </em>(Emphasis added.) Additionally, the appellate courts in this state have established that when a witness admits to making a prior inconsistent statement, additional evidence of the inconsistency is merely cumulative. <em>State </em>v. <em>McDowell, </em>179 Conn. 121, 127, 425 A.2d 935 (1979); <em>State </em>v. <em>Correia, </em>33 Conn. App. 457, 463, 636 A.2d 860, cert. denied, 229 Conn. 911, 642 A.2d 1208, cert. denied, 513 U.S. 898, 115 S. Ct. 253, 130 L. Ed. 2d 174 (1994); <em>State </em>v. <em>Graham, </em>21 Conn. App. 688, 704, 575 A.2d 1057, cert. denied, 216 Conn. 805, 577 A.2d 1063 (1990); <em>State </em>v. <em>Daskam, </em>10 Conn. App. 50, 53, 521 A.2d 587, cert. denied, 203 Conn. 806, 525 A.2d 520 (1987); see <em>State </em>v. <em>Chapman, </em>16 Conn. App. 38, 47, 546 A.2d 929, cert. denied, 209 Conn. 827, 552 A.2d 433 (1988).</p>\n<p id=\"b611-5\">With regard to the recording of the later conversation between Meier and the dispatcher, the court concluded that some portions of the statement were inadmissible hearsay and that others were consistent with his testimony. The defendant failed to perfect the appellate record by seeking an articulation of which statements were inadmissible hearsay and which were not inconsistent testimony. The record, therefore, is not adequate for our review. \u201cThis court\u2019s role is not to guess at possibilities, but to review claims based on a complete factual record developed by a trial court. . . . When our rules of practice are not followed, and the record is not rectified, we are left to guess or speculate as to the existence of a factual predicate.\u201d (Citation omitted; internal quotation marks omitted.) <em>State </em>v. <em>Sargent, </em>87 Conn. App. 24, 30, 864 A.2d 20, cert. denied, 273 Conn. 912, 870 A.2d 1082 (2005). As it is not the function of <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"586\">*586</page-number>this court to find facts when the record is devoid of such findings, we decline to review the defendant\u2019s claim.</p>\n<p id=\"b612-6\">We further note that the defendant\u2019s brief fails to discuss sufficiently his claim on appeal. As we previously noted, we do not address the merits of claims that have been briefed inadequately. See footnote 2. We decline, therefore, to address the defendant\u2019s claim with respect to the admissibility of the recording of the later conversation between Meier and the dispatcher.</p>\n<p id=\"b612-7\">We emphasize that the decision to admit extrinsic evidence for impeachment purposes is vested in the liberal discretion of the trial court. <em>State </em>v. <em>Butler, </em>207 Conn. 619, 626, 543 A.2d 270 (1988). We conclude that in the present case, the court did not abuse this discretion by declining to play the audio recordings to the jury.</p>\n<p id=\"b612-8\">II</p>\n<p id=\"b612-9\">The defendant next argues that the court improperly admitted his hospital record into evidence. Specifically, the defendant claims that the record was not admissible pursuant to the business record exception<footnotemark>4</footnotemark> to the hear<page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"587\">*587</page-number>say rule.<footnotemark>5</footnotemark> We conclude that the court did not abuse its discretion in admitting the hospital record of the defendant into evidence.</p>\n<p id=\"b613-6\">The following additional facts are necessary for our discussion. The state called Peter Jacoby, a physician and the head of the emergency department at St. Mary\u2019s Hospital in Waterbury, as a witness. Jacoby, who was not the defendant\u2019s treating physician, testified that the physicians and nurses who work in the emergency department are required to maintain records on patients. He testified that information gathered by the emergency room department staff is immediately documented in a patient\u2019s record. The prosecutor showed Jacoby portions of the defendant\u2019s medical record. Jacoby indicated that the documents in question were kept in the ordinary course of business of the hospital and generated at or about the time that the information <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"588\">*588</page-number>contained in the record was obtained. The court, over the defendant\u2019s objections, admitted these sections of the defendant\u2019s medical record into evidence.</p>\n<p id=\"b614-6\">We begin our discussion by setting forth the applicable legal principles. \u201cAn out-of-court statement offered to prove the truth of the matter asserted is hearsay and is generally inadmissible unless an exception to the general rule applies.\u201d (Internal quotation marks omitted.) <em>State </em>v. <em>Fasano, </em>88 Conn. App. 17, 39, 868 A.2d 79, cert. denied, 274 Conn. 904, 876 A.2d 15 (2005), cert. denied, 546 U.S. 1101, 126 S. Ct. 1037, 163 L. Ed. 2d 873 (2006); see also Conn. Code Evid. \u00a7 8-2. \u201cSection 52-180 sets forth an exception to the evidentiary rule otherwise barring admission of hearsay evidence for business records that satisfy express criteria. . . . Section 52-180 (a) provides that a record of an act, transaction, occurrence or event is admissible as evidence of that act, transaction, occurrence, or event, provided that the record was made in the regular course of business. . . . The rationale for the exception derives from the inherent trustworthiness of records on which businesses rely to conduct their daily affairs. . . .</p>\n<p id=\"b614-7\">\u201cTo be admissible under the business record exception to the hearsay rule, a trial court judge must find that the record satisfies each of the three conditions set forth in ... \u00a7 52-180. The court must determine, before concluding that it is admissible, that the record was made in the regular course of business, that it was the regular course of such business to make such a record, and that it was made at the time of the act described in the report, or within a reasonable time thereafter. ... In applying the business records exception, the statute [\u00a7 52-180] should be liberally interpreted.\u201d (Citations omitted; internal quotation marks omitted.) <em>State </em>v. <em>Christian, </em>267 Conn. 710, 757-58, 841 A.2d 1158 (2004). Finally, we are mindful that \u201c[a]ppellate review of the admission of a document <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"589\">*589</page-number>under \u00a7 52-180 is limited to determining whether the trial court abused its discretion.\u201d (Internal quotation marks omitted.) <em>State </em>v. <em>Kilroy, </em>61 Conn. App. 164, 169, 763 A.2d 59 (2000).</p>\n<p id=\"b615-6\">In the present case, we conclude that the portions of the defendant\u2019s medical record that were admitted into evidence satisfied the requirements of the business record exception. The defendant\u2019s argument that they should have been excluded because Jacoby was not the treating physician is wholly without merit. The plain language of \u00a7 52-180 (b) provides: \u201cThe writing or record shall not be rendered inadmissible by (1) a party\u2019s failure to produce as witnesses the person or persons who made the writing or record, or who have personal knowledge of the act, transaction, occurrence or event recorded or (2) the party\u2019s failure to show that such persons are unavailable as witnesses. Either of such facts and all other circumstances of the making of the writing or record, including lack of personal knowledge by the entrant or maker, may be shown to affect the weight of the evidence, but not to affect its admissibility.\u201d The statute expressly provides that the person making the record is not required to testify. Furthermore, our Supreme Court has rejected a similar claim. \u201c[T]he fact that the . . . sole witness as to the creation of the records . . . personally did not create each entry in the . . . narrative and [did] not have personal knowledge of the particular events recorded in the entry does not impact the admissibility of the records under \u00a7 52-180.\u201d <em>State </em>v. <em>William C., </em>supra, 267 Conn. 703; see also <em>Calcano </em>v. <em>Calcano, </em>257 Conn. 230, 241, 777 A.2d 633 (2001) (\u201cThis court repeatedly has held that [i]t is not necessary . . . that the witness have been the entrant himself or in the employ of the business when the entry was made. ... It is sufficient for a witness to testify that it was the regular business practice to create a document within a reasonable time <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"590\">*590</page-number>after the occurrence of the event. This is sufficient to ensure that the document was created at the time when the event was fresh in the author\u2019s mind.\u201d [Citation omitted; internal quotation marks omitted.]). We conclude, therefore, that the court did not abuse its discretion in admitting portions of the defendant\u2019s hospital record into evidence.</p>\n<p id=\"b616-6\">The judgment is affirmed.</p>\n<p id=\"b616-7\">In this opinion the other judges concurred.</p>\n<footnote label=\"1\">\n<p id=\"b605-8\"> The defendant was committed to the custody of the commissioner of correction for a total effective sentence of fifty-one years incarceration.</p>\n</footnote>\n<footnote label=\"2\">\n<p id=\"b606-7\"> The defendant also argued that \u201cthe prosecutor committed misconduct by failing to disclose in a timely manner six audiotapes of radio transmissions and 911 calls between the fire department, police department, dispatchers and ambulances. That argument has been preserved for review.\u201d <em>State </em>v. <em>Bermudez, </em>supra, 79 Conn. App. 282 n.7. We previously did not address the merits of this preserved claim of prosecutorial misconduct because we had reversed the judgment on the basis of the defendant\u2019s unpreserved prosecutorial misconduct claims.</p>\n<p id=\"b606-8\">On remand, we decline to review this claim due to the defendant\u2019s failure to brief it adequately. \u201cThis court is not required to review issues that have been improperly presented to this court through an inadequate brief. . . . Analysis, rather than mere abstract assertion, is required in order to avoid abandoning an issue by failure to brief the issue properly. . . . <em>State </em>v. <em>Colon, </em>272 Conn. 106, 153 n.19, 864 A.2d 666 (2004).\u201d (Internal quotation marks omitted.) <em>State </em>v. <em>Nixon, </em>91 Conn. App. 333, 338 n.1, 880 A.2d 199, cert. denied, 276 Conn. 911, 886 A.2d 426 (2005). As our Supreme Court has explained: \u201c[When] the parties cite no law and provide no analysis of their claims, we do not review such claims.\u201d (Internal quotation marks omitted.) <em>State </em>v. <em>Cancel, </em>275 Conn. 1, 3 n.2, 878 A.2d 1103 (2005). Accordingly, we do not review the defendant\u2019s preserved claim of prosecutorial misconduct.</p>\n</footnote>\n<footnote label=\"3\">\n<p id=\"b609-7\"> The court specifically stated: \u201cAs far as his initial radio reports, which recorded the time and his impressions, [Meier] acknowledged that every single question that you asked him, \u2018yes, that\u2019s what I said,\u2019 and, \u2018that\u2019s what time it was.\u2019 So, there is no reason to play the tape for that reason.\u201d</p>\n</footnote>\n<footnote label=\"4\">\n<p id=\"b612-10\"> General Statutes \u00a7 52-180 provides in relevant part: \u201c(a) Any writing or record, whether in the form of an entry in a book or otherwise, made as a memorandum or record of any act, transaction, occurrence or event, shall be admissible as evidence of the act, transaction, occurrence or event, if the trial judge finds that it was made in the regular course of any business, and that it was the regular course of the business to make the writing or record at the time of the act, transaction, occurrence or event or within a reasonable time thereafter.</p>\n<p id=\"b612-11\">\u201cOb) The writing or record shall not be rendered inadmissible by (1) a party\u2019s failure to produce as witnesses the person or persons who made the writing or record, or who have personal knowledge of the act, transaction, occurrence or event recorded or (2) the party\u2019s failure to show that such persons are unavailable as witnesses.

Medical records may be admitted under the business record exception. See, e.g., <em>Calcano </em>v. <em>Calcano, </em>257 Conn. 230, 240-42, 777 A.2d 633 (2001); <em>Puchalsky </em>v. <em>Rappahahn, </em>63 Conn.

In the present case, the state provided an in-court witness, Peter Jacoby, to testify and to qualify the defendant\u2019s medical record as a business record exception to the rule against hearsay. It was therefore unnecessary for the state to comply with the subpoena requirements of \u00a7 4-104.</p>\n</footnote>\n</opinion>\n</casebody>\n",
