On appeal, the defendants claim that the court improperly (1) found that the parties had <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"654\">*654</page-number>agreed to share the cost of paving a road and (2) granted the plaintiffs\u2019 motion for attorney\u2019s fees. We affirm the judgment of the trial court.</p>\n<p id=\"b680-5\">The parties reside on a private road in Westport. In 1999, they discussed the possibility of extending a water main to the end of the road and paving the road. On June 22, 2000, the parties signed a contract with Bridgeport Hydraulic Company (Bridgeport Hydraulic) to extend the water main, but they decided not to begin work until they had hired a paving contractor. The parties still had not hired a paving contractor by June 2, 2001, when Roger Higbie wrote a letter to the plaintiffs, informing them that Bridgeport Hydraulic would raise its price to extend the water main unless the parties paid the entire cost before June 15, 2001. In that letter, Higbie asked each of the plaintiffs to send him a check for one quarter of the total cost and stated that \u201cthe subsequent paving can be a separate issue . . . .\u201d The plaintiffs paid Higbie, and Bridgeport Hydraulic thereafter extended the water main.</p>\n<p id=\"b680-6\">On August 30 and November 6, 2001, Popkin sent the other parties estimates of the cost of paving the road. The defendants wrote a letter to the plaintiffs on November 17,2001, in which they stated: \u201cJust to reiterate what we have said before, we are not interested in participating in a full pavement of [the road] .... If some of you want to pave the whole road, we have no objection, but we are not responsible for the expense.\u201d The plaintiffs then hired a paving contractor for $9500 and asked the defendants to pay one quarter of that cost, but they refused to do so.</p>\n<p id=\"b680-7\">The plaintiffs commenced this action in the small claims session of the Superior Court, seeking $2375 for the defendants\u2019 share of the paving cost. The defendants transferred the case to the regular docket, where the court conducted a trial, found that the parties had <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"655\">*655</page-number>agreed to share the paving cost and awarded the plaintiffs $2375 in damages. The court later awarded the plaintiffs $13,640 in attorney\u2019s fees, pursuant to General Statutes \u00a7 52-251a.<footnotemark>1</footnotemark> The defendants then filed this appeal.<footnotemark>2</footnotemark></p>\n<p id=\"b681-5\">I</p>\n<p id=\"b681-6\">The defendants first claim that they agreed to pay only one quarter of the costs necessary to extend the water main. The defendants contend that Popkin misled them into believing that paving the road was a necessary cost of extending the water main. They argue that they learned of Popkin\u2019s alleged misrepresentation before Roger Higbie sent his letter of June 2, 2001, and that that letter and the Higbies\u2019 subsequent letter of November 17, 2001, relieved them of any responsibility to pay one quarter of the cost to pave the road. We disagree.</p>\n<p id=\"b681-7\">\u201cThe existence of a contract is a question of fact to be determined by the trier on the basis of all the evidence.\u201d (Internal quotation marks omitted.) <em>Heller </em>v. <em>D. W. Fish Realty Co., </em>93 Conn. App. 727, 731, 890 A.2d 113 (2006). \u201c[W]e will upset a factual determination of the trial court only if it is clearly erroneous. The trial court\u2019s findings are binding upon this court unless they are clearly erroneous in light of the evidence and the pleadings in the record as a whole. . . . We cannot retry the facts or pass on the credibility of the witnesses. A finding of fact is clearly erroneous when there is no evi<page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"656\">*656</page-number>dence in the record to support it ... or when although there is evidence to support it, the reviewing court on the entire evidence is left with the definite and firm conviction that a mistake has been committed.\u201d (Internal quotation marks omitted.) <em>U.S. Bank National Assn. </em>v. <em>Palmer, </em>88 Conn. App. 330, 336, 869 A.2d 666 (2005).</p>\n<p id=\"b682-5\">Our review of the transcript indicates that the court\u2019s finding of an agreement among the parties to pave the road depended heavily on its assessment of the credibility of the witnesses. Roger Higbie\u2019s letter of June 2, 2001, which asked the plaintiffs to pay their share of the cost to extend the water main and stated that \u201cthe subsequent paving can be a separate issue\u201d was not sufficient to repudiate the parties\u2019 agreement, as the defendants argue, but to the contrary, supported the court\u2019s finding of an agreement. The court found that that letter \u201csaid nothing more or less than what the parties had always understood . . . [which was] that they were not going to have the paving work done until after the water line was constructed . . . .\u201d The defendants have failed to persuade us that the court\u2019s finding regarding that letter was clearly erroneous.</p>\n<p id=\"b682-6\">Although the defendants contend that Popkin had misrepresented the relationship between the water main extension and the road paving, and that they had discovered the misrepresentation before Roger Higbie wrote his letter of June 2, 2001, that letter failed to communicate their intent not to proceed with the road paving. The court found that the defendants\u2019 letter of November 17, 2001, expressed their reluctance to proceed with the road paving, but the court was entitled to give less weight to that letter in divining the parties\u2019 intent because the defendants wrote that letter after the water main had been extended. We conclude that the court\u2019s finding of an agreement among the parties <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"657\">*657</page-number>to share the cost of paving the road was not clearly erroneous.</p>\n<p id=\"b683-5\">II</p>\n<p id=\"b683-6\">The defendants next claim that the court improperly granted the plaintiffs\u2019 motion for attorney\u2019s fees. We disagree.</p>\n<p id=\"b683-7\">\u201cWe review the award of attorney\u2019s fees for a clear abuse of discretion. Whether any award is to be made and the amount thereof lie within the discretion of the trial court, which is in the best position to evaluate the particular circumstances of a case. . . . [W]e may not alter an award of attorney\u2019s fees unless the trial court has clearly abused its discretion . . . .\u201d (Internal quotation marks omitted.) <em>Krack </em>v. <em>Action Motors Corp., </em>87 Conn. App. 687, 694-95, 867 A.2d 86, cert. denied, 273 Conn. 926, 871 A.2d 1031 (2005).</p>\n<p id=\"b683-8\">The defendants argue that the court should not have granted the plaintiffs\u2019 motion for attorney\u2019s fees because (1) the parties are equally sophisticated litigants and (2) the court rejected count three of the plaintiffs\u2019 amended complaint, in which Forastiere separately alleged promissory estoppel, and therefore the plaintiffs did not prevail, as required by \u00a7 52-251a. We find both of those arguments unpersuasive. Section 52-251a does not require a party to be more sophisticated than the opposing party or that a party must prevail as to every claim. The court\u2019s discretion to award attorney\u2019s fees under \u00a7 52-25 la, therefore, is not limited by the relative sophistication of the parties or the number of counts on which the plaintiffs prevail. See <em>Costanzo </em>v. <em>Mulshine, </em>94 Conn. App. 655, 663-66, 893 A.2d 905 (2006) (explaining that factors inconsistent with the policy underlying \u00a7 52-25 la are not to be considered in determining whether to award attorney\u2019s fees). In the present case, the court; granted the plaintiffs\u2019 motion for attorney\u2019s fees on the basis of its consideration of <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"658\">*658</page-number>all the circumstances. We conclude that the defendants have failed to show that the court clearly abused its discretion.</p>\n<p id=\"b684-4\">The judgment is affirmed.</p>\n<p id=\"b684-5\">In this opinion the other judges concurred.</p>\n<footnote label=\"1\">\n<p id=\"b681-8\"> General Statutes \u00a7 52-251a provides: \u201cWhenever the plaintiff prevails in a small claims matter which was transferred to the regular docket in the Superior Court on the motion of the defendant, the court may allow to the plaintiff his costs, together with reasonable attorney\u2019s fees to be taxed by the court.\u201d</p>\n</footnote>\n<footnote label=\"2\">\n<p id=\"b681-9\"> Although the record does not contain a written memorandum of decision or a signed transcript of the court\u2019s oral decisions in compliance with Practice Book \u00a7 64-1, we will review the defendants\u2019 claims because the transcript contains a sufficiently detailed and concise statement of the court's findings and conclusions in connection with its decisions. See <em>McCord </em>v. <em>Fredette, </em>92 Conn. App. 131, 132 n.3, 883 A.2d 1258 (2005).</p>\n</footnote>\n</opinion>\n</casebody>\n",
