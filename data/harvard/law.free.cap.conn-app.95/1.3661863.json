The respondent claims that the court improperly granted the petitioner habeas <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"3\">*3</page-number>relief without first concluding that the petitioner suffered from a serious medical condition and that, if the court did reach such a conclusion, it was not supported by the evidence. The respondent also claims that the court improperly concluded that she was deliberately indifferent to the petitioner\u2019s condition. We affirm the judgment of the habeas court.</p>\n<p id=\"b29-5\">The petitioner pleaded guilty under the <em>Alford </em>doctrine<footnotemark>1</footnotemark> to sexual assault in the third degree and risk of injury to a child. Following the trial court\u2019s imposition of a sentence in accordance with the plea,<footnotemark>2</footnotemark> the petitioner was charged with violating two conditions of his probation. The court concluded that the petitioner had violated both conditions, revoked the petitioner\u2019s probation and ordered the petitioner to serve the twelve year sentence originally imposed. Our Supreme Court upheld the court\u2019s judgment. <em>State </em>v. <em>Faraday, </em>268 Conn. 174, 842 A.2d 567 (2004).</p>\n<p id=\"b29-6\">In December, 2002, the petitioner filed a petition for a writ of habeas corpus. The petitioner alleged that the conditions of his confinement were inhumane or dangerous to him because the respondent denied him necessary medical care for a back condition.<footnotemark>3</footnotemark> The petitioner alleged, inter alia, that a magnetic resonance imaging (MRI) scan of his back and an operation to repair herniated discs in his back were medically necessary, and that the respondent had denied his requests for the same.</p>\n<p id=\"b29-7\">In April, 2003, the court conducted an evidentiary hearing related to the petition and dismissed the peti<page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"4\">*4</page-number>tion. Shortly thereafter, the petitioner filed a motion for \u201creconsideration and reargument.\u201d The petitioner represented that, since the time of the court\u2019s dismissal of his petition, he came into possession of evidence from Manchester Memorial Hospital to substantiate his claimed disability, evidence that he did not possess at the time of the prior hearing. In May, 2003, the court granted the petitioner\u2019s motion.</p>\n<p id=\"b30-5\">The court conducted a second hearing on February 14, 2005.<footnotemark>4</footnotemark> Among the evidence presented by the petitioner were the results of a computed tomography (CT) scan performed on him in November, 1992,<footnotemark>5</footnotemark> as well as the results of an MRI scan performed on him in October, 2003. In an oral ruling,<footnotemark>6</footnotemark> the court found that the petitioner suffered from a herniated disc. The court concluded that the respondent\u2019s failure to provide the petitioner with the evaluative services of a neurologist or a neurosurgeon reflected deliberate indifference to the petitioner\u2019s medical needs. The court ordered the respondent \u201cto have the petitioner evaluated for his disc or back problem by a neurosurgeon or a neurologist to determine what course of action should be taken, if any.\u201d The court later granted the respondent\u2019s petition for certification to appeal.</p>\n<p id=\"b30-6\">Before addressing the respondent\u2019s claims, we set forth the relevant constitutional principles that apply to the petitioner\u2019s claim for relief. \u201cThe scope of relief available through a petition for habeas coipus is limited. In order to invoke the trial court\u2019s subject matter jurisdiction in a habeas action, a petitioner must allege that <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"5\">*5</page-number>he is illegally confined or has been deprived of his liberty. Our Supreme Court found that [t]he writ of habeas corpus, as it is employed in the twentieth century, however, does not focus solely upon a direct attack on the underlying judgment or upon release from confinement . . . but is available as a remedy for issues of fundamental fairness implicating constitutional rights.\u201d (Citation omitted; internal quotation marks omitted.) <em>Santiago </em>v. <em>Commissioner of Correction, 39 </em>Conn. App. 674, 679, 667 A.2d 304 (1995); see <em>Sanchez </em>v. <em>Warden, </em>214 Conn. 23, 33, 570 A.2d 673 (1990).</p>\n<p id=\"b31-4\">The eighth amendment to the constitution of the United States, made applicable to the states by the fourteenth amendment, provides: \u201cExcessive bail shall not be required, nor excessive fines imposed, nor cruel and unusual punishments inflicted.\u201d \u201cCruel and unusual punishment encompasses more than barbarous physical punishment. ... It also includes punishments which involve the unnecessary and wanton infliction of pain . . . and those which are grossly disproportionate to the severity of the crime. . . .</p>\n<p id=\"b31-5\">\u201cThe test for determining whether a given set of conditions of confinement violates the eighth amendment is not static. It is determined by the evolving standards of decency that mark the progress of a maturing society. . . . These standards are established not by the opinion of experts as to desirable prison conditions . . . nor by the subjective views of judges, but rather by objective factors to the maximum extent possible. . . . Unquestioned and serious deprivations of basic human needs . . . and deprivation of the minimal civilized measure of life\u2019s necessities . . . are obvious cases of eighth amendment violations. . . . But conditions that cannot be said to be cruel and unusual under contemporary standards are not unconstitutional. To the extent that such conditions are restrictive and even harsh, they are part of the penalty that criminal offenders pay for their <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"6\">*6</page-number>offenses against society.\u201d (Citations omitted; internal quotation marks omitted.) <em>Arey </em>v. <em>Warden, </em>187 Conn. 324, 328-29, 445 A.2d 916 (1982).</p>\n<p id=\"b32-5\">\u201cThe Constitution does not mandate comfortable prisons . . . but neither does it permit inhumane ones, and it is now settled that the treatment a prisoner receives in prison and the conditions under which he is confined are subject to scrutiny under the Eighth Amendment .... In its prohibition against cruel and unusual punishments, the Eighth Amendment places restraints on prison officials, who may not, for example, use excessive force against prisoners. . . . The Amendment also imposes duties on these officials, who must provide humane conditions of confinement; prison officials must ensure that inmates receive adequate food, clothing, shelter, and medical care, and must take reasonable measures to guarantee the safety of the inmates . . . .\u201d (Citations omitted; internal quotation marks omitted.) <em>Farmer </em>v. <em>Brennan, </em>511 U.S. 825, 832, 114 S.

Ed. 2d 251 (1976), the United States Supreme Court concluded: \u201c[Deliberate indifference to serious medical needs of prisoners constitutes the unnecessary and wanton infliction of pain . . . proscribed by the Eighth Amendment. This is true whether the indifference is manifested by prison doctors in response to the prisoner\u2019s needs or by prison guards in intentionally denying or delaying access to medical care or intentionally interfering with the treatment once prescribed.\u201d (Citation omitted; internal quotation marks omitted.) Id., 104-105. The <em>Estelle </em>court observed: \u201c[T]he [Eighth] Amendment proscribes more than physically barbarous punishments. . . . The Amendment embodies broad and idealistic concepts of dignity, civilized standards, humanity, and decency . . . against which we must evaluate penal measures. Thus, we have held repugnant <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"7\">*7</page-number>to the Eighth Amendment punishments which are incompatible with the evolving standards of decency that mark the progress of a maturing society ... or which involve the unnecessary and wanton infliction of pain ....</p>\n<p id=\"b33-5\">\u201cThese elementary principles establish the government\u2019s obligation to provide medical care for those whom it is punishing by incarceration. An inmate must rely on prison authorities to treat his medical needs; if the authorities fail to do so, those needs will not be met. In the worst cases, such a failure may actually produce physical torture or a lingering death . . . the evils of most immediate concern to the drafters of the Amendment. In less serious cases, denial of medical care may result in pain and suffering which no one suggests would serve any penological purpose. . . . The infliction of such unnecessary suffering is inconsistent with contemporary standards of decency as manifested in modem legislation codifying the common-law view that it is but just that the public be required to care for the prisoner, who cannot by reason of the deprivation of his liberty, care for himself.\u201d (Citations omitted; internal quotation marks omitted.) Id., 102-104.</p>\n<p id=\"b33-6\">A prisoner seeking habeas relief on the basis of his conditions of confinement, which includes the medical care made available to him,<footnotemark>7</footnotemark> bears the burden of establishing both aspects of his claim. \u201cFirst, the alleged deprivation of adequate conditions must be objectively, sufficiently serious . . . such that the petitioner was denied the minimal civilized measure of life\u2019s necessities .... Second, the official involved must have had <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"8\">*8</page-number>a sufficiently culpable state of mind described as deliberate indifference to inmate health or safety.\u201d (Citation omitted; internal quotation marks omitted.) <em>Fuller </em>v. <em>Commissioner of Correction, </em>75 Conn. App. 133, 136-37, 815 A.2d 208 (2003).</p>\n<p id=\"b34-5\">Our standard of review is well settled. \u201cThe habeas court is afforded broad discretion in making its factual findings, and those findings will not be disturbed unless they are clearly erroneous. . . . The application of the habeas court\u2019s factual findings to the pertinent legal standard, however, presents a mixed question of law and fact . . . .\u201d (Citation omitted.) <em>Duperry </em>v. <em>Solnit, </em>261 Conn. 309, 335, 803 A.2d 287 (2002).</p>\n<p id=\"b34-6\">I</p>\n<p id=\"b34-7\">The respondent first claims that the court improperly granted the petitioner habeas relief without first concluding that the petitioner suffered from a serious medical condition. The respondent also claims that, if the court reached such a conclusion, it was not supported by the evidence. We disagree with both aspects of this claim.</p>\n<p id=\"b34-8\">A prisoner seeking relief under the eighth amendment on the basis of inadequate medical care must demonstrate the objective aspect of his claim; the prisoner must establish that a <em>serious </em>medical condition exists that requires medical care. <em>Wilson </em>v. <em>Seiter, </em>501 U.S. 294, 298, 111 S. Ct. 2321, 115 L. Ed. 2d 271 (1991). Certainly, every denial of a prisoner\u2019s request for medical care does not reflect cruel and unusual punishment. The seriousness of a prisoner\u2019s medical condition must be evaluated on a case-by-case basis in light of a standard of \u201cseriousness\u201d that has proven difficult for courts to articulate. \u201cBecause society does not expect that prisoners will have unqualified access to health care, a prisoner must first make this threshold showing of serious illness or injury in order to state an Eighth <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"9\">*9</page-number>Amendment claim for denial of medical care.\u201d (Internal quotation marks omitted.) <em>Smith </em>v. <em>Carpenter, </em>316 F.3d 178, 184 (2d Cir. 2003). The standard is met where there is \u201c \u2018a condition of urgency, one that may produce death, degeneration, or extreme pain\u2019 . . . .\u201d <em>Hathaway </em>v. <em>Coughlin, </em>37 F.3d 63, 66 (2d Cir. 1994), cert. denied sub nom. <em>Foote </em>v. <em>Hathaway, </em>513 U.S. 1154, 115 S. Ct. 1108, 130 L. Ed. 2d 1074 (1995), quoting <em>Nance </em>v. <em>Kelly, </em>912 F.2d 605, 607 (2d Cir. 1990) (Pratt, J., dissenting); see also <em>Johnson </em>v. <em>Wright, </em>412 F.3d 398, 403 (2d Cir. 2005); <em>Morales </em>v. <em>Mackalm, 278 F.3d 126, 132 </em>(2d Cir. 2002); <em>Hemmings </em>v. <em>Gorczyk, </em>134 F.3d 104, 108 (2d Cir. 1998). Factors also deemed relevant when assessing a medical condition include \u201c[t]he existence of an injury that a reasonable doctor or patient would find important and worthy of comment or treatment; the presence of a medical condition that significantly affects an individual\u2019s daily activities; or the existence of chronic and substantial pain.\u201d (Internal quotation marks omitted.) <em>Chance </em>v. <em>Armstrong, </em>143 F.3d 698, 702, aff'd, 159 F.3d 1345 (2d Cir. 1998).</p>\n<p id=\"b35-4\">A</p>\n<p id=\"b35-5\">As a matter of law, the respondent properly asserts that the court could not afford the petitioner relief in the present case if it did not conclude that a serious medical condition existed. The respondent\u2019s trial counsel specifically asked the court to make findings concerning the petitioner\u2019s \u201cserious medical condition\u201d if it was to rule in the petitioner\u2019s favor. The court explicitly found that the petitioner suffered from a herniated disc. Although the court did not explicitly label this condition a \u201cserious medical condition,\u201d it is abundantly clear from the court\u2019s decision that it deemed this condition to be \u201cserious\u201d in nature, such that it gave rise to an urgent need for medical evaluation.</p>\n<p id=\"b36-4\"><page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"10\">*10</page-number>B</p>\n<p id=\"b36-5\">We now address the respondent\u2019s claim that the evidence did not support a conclusion that a serious medical condition existed. The respondent argues that, even if the evidence supported a conclusion that the petitioner\u2019s back condition was a serious medical condition at the time of the first hearing in April, 2003, there was no evidence that this condition existed at the time of the second hearing in February, 2005. The respondent argues that the evidence before the court in April, 2003, supported a finding that the petitioner had a condition in his back that caused him to experience pain that \u201c \u2018comes and goes.\u2019 \u201d Moreover, the respondent argues that, at the time of the court\u2019s judgment, the most recent evidence concerning the petitioner\u2019s condition consisted of a 2003 MRI scan report that supported a finding that the petitioner suffered from degenerative disc disease. The respondent asserts that, at the time of the February, 2005 hearing, \u201cthere was no evidence before the court concerning the likely progression of this condition or the pain it might cause.\u201d The respondent further asserts that there were no recent medical records in evidence and that \u201cthere was no evidence that the petitioner experienced any back pain from the time of the first hearing until the time of the second hearing nearly two years later.\u201d</p>\n<p id=\"b36-6\">The court heavily relied on two exhibits in making findings about the petitioner\u2019s condition. First, the court relied on a report prepared on November 13, 1992, by Arthur Ostrowitz, a medical doctor affiliated with Manchester Memorial Hospital. The report discussed the results of a CT scan performed on the petitioner, indicating \u201c[d]isc herniation with right leg pain weakness and numbness.\u201d The report further stated: \u201cAt the <em>IA-SI </em>level we see a mild generalized bulge without focal protrusion. At the L5-S1 level we see a central and right sided herniated migrated disc which appears to extend <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"11\">*11</page-number>upward to nearly the level of the L4-5 disc.\u201d The report concludes: \u201cHerniated migrated central right sided disc herniation at the L5-S1 level.\u201d</p>\n<p id=\"b37-5\">The court also relied on an October, 2003 \u201cDiagnostic Radiologic Report\u201d that stated the results of an MRI scan performed on the petitioner. The report includes findings of \u201cdesiccation involving L4-5 intervertebral disc,\u201d \u201cevidence of decreased height, as well as desiccation involving the L5-S1,\u201d \u201cmild diffuse disc bulge\u201d at the L4-5 level, \u201ca small central disc protrusion\u201d at L5-S1 and \u201cmild facet joint arthritic changes seen at L34, L4-5, L5-S1.\u201d Among the report\u2019s conclusions were findings of \u201c[degenerative disc disease with mild diffuse disc bulge at L4-5\u201d and \u201c[s]mall central disc protrusion with degenerative disc disease at L5-S1.\u201d</p>\n<p id=\"b37-6\">The court accepted as true the findings and conclusions set forth in these reports. The court discussed the fact that these reports \u201ctrackjed] each other\u201d in terms of their relevant findings and their shared conclusion, which was that the petitioner suffers from degenerative disc disease. The court stated that \u201ccommon sense\u201d required it to find that \u201cthere is a bulge at L4-5 and there is also a herniated disc at L5-S1.\u201d</p>\n<p id=\"b37-7\">In his habeas petition, the petitioner represented under oath that his condition caused him \u201cconstant discomfort, sometimes to the point [that it is] difficult to walk, or even sit for periods of time.\u201d The petitioner further represented that he experienced \u201cconstantly mild pain\u201d at most times and that he has attempted to alleviate his pain through exercise and the use of pillows during times of rest. At the time of the first hearing in April, 2003, the respondent elicited testimony from Edward Blanchette, a medical doctor and the clinical director of the department of correction. Blanchette testified, on the basis of his review of the petitioner\u2019s medical records, that the petitioner had complained <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"12\">*12</page-number>to prison medical staff of pains that \u201ccome and go.\u201d Blanchette testified: \u201cI do know that he has back pain, and I certainly admit that, and I do know that he has degenerative joint disease in his spine.\u201d Blanchette also opined that he expected the petitioner to continue to experience \u201clow back pain exacerbations.\u201d It was undisputed that, apart from seeking further diagnostic services and surgery, the petitioner sought accommodations from prison officials for the purpose of alleviating his back pain.<footnotemark>8</footnotemark></p>\n<p id=\"b38-4\">There was sufficient evidence to demonstrate that the petitioner suffered from a serious medical condition in April, 2003, at the time of the first hearing. The evidence demonstrated that the petitioner suffered from disc disease that was degenerative in nature and caused the petitioner significant pain, albeit not constant pain. The evidence permitted a conclusion that the petitioner suffered from the type of chronic painful condition that a reasonable physician or patient would find worthy of comment and that negatively and significantly affected the petitioner\u2019s daily life. There is no basis in the record, or by the exercise of common sense, to find that the petitioner\u2019s back condition, a condition that was documented in 1992 and, by virtue of its nature, existed at the time of the first hearing in 2003, ceased to exist at the time of the second hearing in 2005. Similarly, there is no basis on which to conclude that the painful side effects of this degenerative condition abated at the time of the second hearing. Accordingly, we reject the respondent\u2019s claim that the court improperly concluded that the petitioner suffered from a serious medical condition in 2005.</p>\n<p id=\"b39-4\"><page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"13\">*13</page-number>II</p>\n<p id=\"b39-5\">The respondent next claims that the court improperly concluded that she deliberately was indifferent to the petitioner\u2019s condition. We disagree.</p>\n<p id=\"b39-6\">A prisoner seeking relief under the eighth amendment on the ground of inadequate medical care must also demonstrate the subjective aspect of his claim, which is that prison officials deliberately have been indifferent to his medical condition. \u201cThe second requirement follows from the principle that only the unnecessary and wanton infliction of pain implicates the Eighth Amendment. ... To violate the Cruel and Unusual Punishments Clause, a prison official must have a sufficiently culpable state of mind. ... In prison-conditions cases that state of mind is one of deliberate indifference to inmate health or safety . . . .\u201d (Citations omitted; internal quotation marks omitted.) <em>Farmer v. Brennan, </em>supra, 511 U.S. 834. \u201c[A] prison official cannot be found liable under the Eighth Amendment for denying an inmate humane conditions of confinement unless the official knows of and disregards an excessive risk to inmate health or safety; the official must both be aware of facts from which the inferences could be drawn that a substantial risk of serious harm exists, and he must also draw the inference.\u201d Id., 837; see also <em>Hunnicutt </em>v. <em>Commissioner of Correction, </em>67 Conn. App. 65, 69, 787 A.2d 22 (2001) (absent finding of deliberate indifference, finding of serious medical need alone renders claim nonconstitutional).</p>\n<p id=\"b39-7\">If the prison officials were merely negligent in denying the petitioner\u2019s treatment, it would not constitute an eighth amendment violation. Similarly, medical malpractice alone, reflecting negligence or inadvertence, does not constitute an eighth amendment violation. <em>Estelle v. Gamble, </em>supra, 429 U.S. 105-106. \u201c[Deliberate indifference\u201d lies \u201csomewhere between the poles of <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"14\">*14</page-number>negligence at one end and purpose or knowledge at the other . . . .\u201d <em>Farmer v. </em>Brennan, supra, 511 U.S. 836; see also <em>Smith v. Carpenter, </em>supra, 316 F.3d 184. Deliberate indifference has been found in circumstances in which prison officials have disregarded the recommendations of a prisoner\u2019s treating physician; <em>Johnson </em>v. <em>Wright, </em>supra, 412 F.3d 404; and in circumstances in which prison officials have refused treatment for certain degenerative conditions. See <em>Harrison </em>v. <em>Barkley, </em>219 F.3d 132, 138 (2d Cir. 2000) (\u201c[i]t follows that (1) outright refusal of any treatment for a degenerative condition that tends to cause acute infection and pain if left untreated <em>and </em>(2) imposition of a seriously unreasonable condition on such treatment, both constitute deliberative indifference on the part of prison officials\u201d [emphasis in original]).</p>\n<p id=\"b40-5\">The respondent argues that the court\u2019s conclusion that she was deliberately indifferent to the petitioner\u2019s serious medical condition was improper because the petitioner did not present any expert evidence demonstrating that the \u201cappropriate standard of care\u201d required prison officials to treat his condition differently or, specifically, to refer him to a specialist. The respondent argues that the only expert evidence with regard to this issue consisted of Blanchette\u2019s opinion that the petitioner \u201cwas not a surgical candidate\u201d and that additional evaluation was not necessary. The respondent argues that the court improperly discredited Blanchette\u2019s expert opinion and concluded that \u201cdeliberate indifference\u201d had been demonstrated in a case in which prison officials had a good faith basis on which to decline the petitioner\u2019s request for additional medical care.</p>\n<p id=\"b40-6\">In its findings, the court explicitly discussed Blanchette\u2019s opinion that the type of conservative treat<page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"15\">*15</page-number>ment<footnotemark>9</footnotemark> that had been provided to the petitioner was medically appropriate and that an evaluation by other specialists was not appropriate. The court stated that Blanchette was \u201cnot an expert in neurology or neurosurgery\u201d and that Blanchette himself had not examined the petitioner. The court acknowledged that it was neither \u201can expert\u201d nor in possession of expert evidence from any other expert witness. The court, however, discussed the medical reports that were in evidence and stated that \u201ccommon sense\u201d dictated that the evidence before it of degenerative disc disease, and the extent of such disease, demonstrated the existence of a medical condition that warranted further examination of the petitioner by a neurologist or a neurosurgeon.</p>\n<p id=\"b41-5\">As a preliminary matter, we disagree with the respondent\u2019s assertions that the court improperly chose not to rely on Blanchette\u2019s opinion. The court did not hold, as the respondent asserts, that Blanchette was incapable of rendering an expert opinion with regard to the issue of the petitioner\u2019s treatment. Instead, the court, in some measure, looked unfavorably on Blanchette\u2019s opinion of the petitioner\u2019s condition because Blanchette was not an \u201cexpert in neurology or neurosurgery.\u201d This determination, which reflected the court\u2019s careful evaluation of the evidence before it, was not improper. Certainly, the court was not required to accept as true the respondent\u2019s uncontradicted expert testimony. See <em>Doehrer v. Commissioner of Correction, </em>68 Conn. App. 774, 784, 795 A.2d 548, cert. denied, 260 Conn. 924, 797 A.2d 520 (2002).</p>\n<p id=\"b41-6\">We also disagree with the respondent\u2019s assertion that the court\u2019s conclusion was improper because there was no expert evidence that supported it. The respondent asserts that deliberate indifference must \u201calmost <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"16\">*16</page-number>always\u201d be proven by expert medical testimony. The respondent likewise asserts that expert evidence was necessary to demonstrate that appropriate treatment of the petitioner\u2019s condition included the evaluations that the court deemed to be constitutionally mandated. Generally, \u201cexpert testimony is required when the question involved goes beyond the field of the ordinary knowledge and experience of judges or jurors . . . .\u201d (Citations omitted; internal quotation marks omitted.) <em>Evans </em>v. <em>Warden, </em>29 Conn. App. 274, 280, 613 A.2d 327 (1992). \u201cWhether expert testimony is required in a particular case is determined on a case-by-case basis and its necessity is dependent on whether the issues are of sufficient complexity to warrant the use of the testimony as assistance to the habeas court. ... It is the habeas court, therefore, that must initially decide whether, in order to make intelligent findings, it needs expert testimony on the question that it must decide. ... A trial court has broad discretion in determining whether expert testimony is needed.\u201d (Internal quotation marks omitted.) <em>Torres v. Commissioner of Correction, </em>84 Conn. App. 561, 567-68, 854 A.2d 97 (2004).</p>\n<p id=\"b42-5\">We conclude that the issues presented in this case were not so complex that the court\u2019s decision to resolve the issue before it on the basis of its \u201ccommonsense\u201d view of the evidence reflected an abuse of discretion. The court had before it several reports that explained the physical characteristics of the petitioner\u2019s degenerative condition, as well as Blanchette\u2019s testimony concerning the condition. The court also had before it evidence concerning the extent of the treatment that the respondent provided to the petitioner and the effectiveness of such treatment. On the basis of this evidence, the court was able to exercise its judgment as to whether additional evaluation of the petitioner\u2019s condition was available and appropriate. The court did not order the respondent to perform specific medical <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"17\">*17</page-number>procedures on the petitioner; the court ordered the respondent to provide the petitioner with an evaluation by a specialist in neurology for the purpose of assessing the petitioner\u2019s condition and recommending any possible alternative treatment.</p>\n<p id=\"b43-4\">Insofar as expert testimony is concerned, it is necessary to distinguish between habeas cases alleging deliberate indifference and tort cases sounding in medical malpractice. In medical malpractice cases, competent expert testimony is almost always required to demonstrate the requisite standar d of care or deviation therefrom. See, e.g., <em>Boone </em>v. <em>William W. Backus Hospital, </em>272 Conn. 551, 567-68, 864 A.2d 1 (2005). The \u201cmedical appropriateness\u201d of the treatment being afforded the petitioner was not the dispositive consideration of the court\u2019s inquiry in the present case. See <em>Olivier </em>v. <em>Robert L. Yeager Mental Health Center, </em>398 F.3d 183, 191 n.7 (2d Cir. 2005). Rather the question raised before the habeas court was whether the respondent had been deliberately indifferent to the petitioner\u2019s serious medical needs. See id. In <em>Hathaway </em>v. <em>Coughlin, </em>supra, 37 F.3d 68, the United States Court of Appeals for the Second Circuit held that the absence of expert testimony, or a showing of at least medical malpractice, in an action alleging deliberate indifference to serious medical needs did not warrant dismissal of the action where the facts supported a finding of such indifference. The court explained: \u201cThe inquiry remains whether the treating physician or other prison official was deliberately indifferent to a prisoner\u2019s serious medical needs, not whether the doctor\u2019s conduct is actionable under state malpractice law.\u201d Id.</p>\n<p id=\"b43-5\">Although expert evidence in support of the petitioner\u2019s claim might have bolstered the petitioner\u2019s case, we are not persuaded that such testimony was required in this case. Further, we are persuaded that the court properly concluded that deliberate indifference had <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"18\">*18</page-number>been demonstrated in the present case. The court had before it evidence that the petitioner suffered from a serious medical condition. The October, 2003 MRI scan report disclosed that the petitioner\u2019s condition was evidenced by disc bulge, disc protrusion and disc disease. The evidence reflected that the petitioner frequently sought various forms of relief from the pain occasioned by his condition, from requests for accommodations such as an extra pillow to requests to be referred to a specialist. A March, 2000 \u201cDiagnostic Radiologic Report\u201d issued by a medical doctor at the University of Connecticut Health Center recommended that the petitioner undergo a bone scan and, possibly, a CT scan. The record reflects, however, that the respondent provided the petitioner with an MRI scan in October, 2003, only after the petitioner brought the results of his newly discovered 1992 CT scan to the court\u2019s attention. There is no evidence that the respondent has provided the petitioner with a bone scan.</p>\n<p id=\"b44-5\">The court made ample findings concerning (1) the fact that the treatment afforded to the petitioner had not alleviated his physical condition or the pain occasioned by it, (2) the extent and nature of the petitioner\u2019s disc condition and (3) the respondent\u2019s repeated refusal to provide the petitioner with the evaluative services of a neurologist or a neurosurgeon.<footnotemark>10</footnotemark> On the basis of these findings, we conclude that the petitioner demonstrated that the respondent possessed a culpable state <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"19\">*19</page-number>of mind. The court reasonably could have concluded that prison officials were aware of the pain being experienced by the petitioner and disregarded a substantial risk that the petitioner\u2019s painful condition would either continue or worsen under the admittedly \u201cconservative\u201d course of treatment being provided to him. The court reasonably could have inferred that the respondent\u2019s denials of the petitioner\u2019s repeated request for further medical evaluation or treatment reflected a reckless disregard for the petitioner\u2019s suffering and not, as the respondent asserts, merely the respondent\u2019s \u201cgood faith\u201d medical decisions.</p>\n<p id=\"b45-5\">The judgment is affirmed.</p>\n<p id=\"b45-6\">In this opinion GRUENDEL, J., concurred.</p>\n<footnote label=\"1\">\n<p id=\"b29-8\"> See <em>North Carolina </em>v. <em>Alford, </em>400 U.S. 25, 91 S.

The majority affirms the habeas court\u2019s oral ruling in which it determined that the respondent, the commissioner of correction, acted with deliberate indifference to the medical needs of the petitioner, William Faraday, in refusing to arrange the medical evaluation sought by the petitioner. I respectfully disagree because I believe that the court\u2019s findings and conclusions were unsupported by any evidence.</p>\n<p id=\"b45-8\">In order to grant habeas relief to a prisoner on the basis of deliberate indifference to inmate health or safety, the petitioner bears the burden of establishing both aspects of his claim. <em>Fuller </em>v. <em>Commissioner of Correction, </em>75 Conn. App. 133, 136, 815 A.2d 208 (2003). First, the deprivation must be sufficiently serious such that the petitioner is denied the minimal civilized measure of life\u2019s necessities. Id. Second, the official must be shown to be culpable, that is, deliberately indifferent to health or safety. Id., 137. The majority has appropriately cited <em>Estelle </em>v. <em>Gamble, </em>429 U.S. 97, 97 S. Ct. 285, 50 L. Ed. 2d 251 (1976), for the proposition that \u201c[d]eliberate indifference to serious medical needs of <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"20\">*20</page-number>prisoners constitutes the unnecessary and wanton infliction of pain . . . proscribed by the Eighth Amendment.\u201d (Citation omitted; internal quotation marks omitted.) Id., 104. A refusal to assent to an inmate\u2019s medical request, however, does not necessarily constitute \u201cdeliberate indifference,\u201d nor does every medical need amount to a \u201cserious medical need.\u201d To the contrary, the term \u201cserious medical need\u201d refers specifically to \u201ca condition of urgency . . . that may produce death, degeneration, or extreme pain\u201d; (internal quotation marks omitted) <em>Hathaway </em>v. <em>Coughlin, </em>99 F.3d 550, 553 (2d Cir. 1996); and the term \u201cdeliberate indifference\u201d has been inteipreted to require conduct equaling criminal recklessness. <em>Hemmings </em>v. <em>Gorczyk, </em>134 F.3d 104, 108 (2d Cir. 1998). Deliberate indifference, therefore, clearly does not contemplate good faith differences of opinion that cause officials to deny medical procedures or consultations. See <em>Estelle </em>v. <em>Gamble, </em>supra, 105-106 (\u201cinadvertent failure to provide adequate medical care cannot be said to constitute \u2018an unnecessary and wanton infliction of pain\u2019 or to be \u2018repugnant to the conscience of mankind\u2019 \u201d); <em>Swindell </em>v. <em>Supple, </em>No. 02-3182, 2005 WL 267725, *8 (S.D.N.Y. 2005) (\u201cA medical decision not to order an x-ray, or like measures, does not represent cruel and unusual punishment. . . . Nor is a denial of consultation with a specialist in itself an act of medical indifference.\u201d [Citations omitted; internal quotation marks omitted]).</p>\n<p id=\"b46-5\">On appeal, the respondent argues that the court made no finding of a \u201cserious\u201d deprivation and that, in fact, no such finding could be made on the basis of the evidence that was presented. The respondent further argues that even if the court had made a finding in 2003 that the petitioner\u2019s back pain constituted a serious medical condition, no evidence was presented to the court in 2005, nearly two years later, that the condition or the pain had persisted. The respondent also argues <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"21\">*21</page-number>that the petitioner failed to offer any evidence to establish deliberate indifference. I am persuaded on all scores.</p>\n<p id=\"b47-5\">At the first hearing before the court, held in 2003, the petitioner testified, but did not present any witnesses nor did he present any medical evidence. He sought a magnetic resonance imaging procedure (MRI), a surgery, a pass for a second pillow and a foam pad for his bed. As the majority notes, the petitioner attached a statement to his verified habeas petition, which he filed in 2002. All the allegations and claims made in the petition, however, were three years out of date by the time of the 2005 hearing. Moreover, the court had denied relief to the petitioner on the basis of the very same verified petition, including the attached statement. The respondent presented testimony by Edward Blanchette, the clinical director for the department of correction who was board certified in internal medicine and infectious disease. Although Blanchette acknowledged that the petitioner had degenerative joint disease in his back, which caused intermittent pain, he testified that the petitioner\u2019s condition could be managed effectively, as it had been in the past, with muscle relaxants and pain medication. Blanchette testified that neither an MRI procedure nor a surgical consultation was necessary. Because the pain was intermittent, surgery would not be appropriate. The court ruled orally in favor of the respondent, denying the petitioner\u2019s requests, apparently on the basis of Blanchette\u2019s testimony. One month later, the petitioner filed a motion for reargument, claiming that he had \u201cnew information or evidence . . . .\u201d The new evidence turned out to be a 1992 computed tomography (CT) scan. Following a proceeding in federal court, the department of correction had an MRI procedure performed on the petitioner\u2019s back. The procedure confirmed the degenerative disk disease and found no evidence of any disc extrusion, thus confirm<page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"22\">*22</page-number>ing Blanchette\u2019s opinion. Thereafter, the court ordered a new hearing.</p>\n<p id=\"b48-5\">At the second evidentiary hearing, which was held in February, 2005, nearly two years after the first hearing, the petitioner presented several items of evidence.<footnotemark>1</footnotemark> One item consisted of the results of the 1992 CT scan that had been performed on him nearly thirteen years prior to the hearing; a second item consisted of the results of the October, 2003 MRI procedure performed on him approximately sixteen months prior. The petitioner offered no testimony, much less expert medical testimony. Significantly, no evidence was presented as to the petitioner\u2019s medical condition at the time of the second hearing. The respondent produced an affidavit of its medical expert, Blanchette, who had testified at length at the petitioner\u2019s first habeas hearing before the same court. Blanchette\u2019s sworn statement indicated that the October, 2003 procedure confirmed his earlier testimony that the petitioner was not a surgical candidate. Blanchette also explained the efforts that the respondent had engaged in to locate the 1992 CT scan.</p>\n<p id=\"b48-6\">Undeterred by the lack of evidence supporting the petitioner\u2019s claim, the court, while acknowledging that it was \u201cnot an expert\u201d and that it did \u201cnot have the testimony or an affidavit from a neurologist or a neurosurgeon,\u201d offered its own \u201ccommonsense\u201d analysis of the petitioner\u2019s condition on the basis of the earlier hearing testimony, on which it originally had denied relief, and the outdated diagnostic exhibits. While discounting Blanchette\u2019s testimony, on which it had relied before, because Blanchette was not a specialist in neurology or neurosurgery and had not done a \u201chands on\u201d <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"23\">*23</page-number>physical examination, the court relied instead on <em>its own medical conclusions </em>concerning the petitioner\u2019s condition. Although failing to find a \u201cserious medical condition\u201d in specific terms, and lacking evidentiary support for any such finding, the court nonetheless decided that the respondent\u2019s refusal to comply with the petitioner\u2019s request for a surgical consultation constituted deliberate indifference to the petitioner\u2019s medical needs and ordered a consultation with a neurologist or neurosurgeon. The court cited no evidence of deliberate indifference, nor could it because none was offered, in reaching its conclusion. The sole evidence of the way the respondent had managed this situation was Blanchette\u2019s earlier testimony that neither surgery nor further evaluations were medically appropriate. Nonetheless, the court volunteered its personal opinion that the respondent was displaying \u201crigidity\u201d by refusing to authorize a consultation. Reaching even further outside the record in this case, the court bolstered its speculation by stating that it had \u201cseen this rigidity before in the case of Gregory Thomas versus respondent,\u201d an unrelated case concerning sex offender classification.</p>\n<p id=\"b49-4\">Because my examination of the record of this case reveals no evidence whatsoever supporting the court\u2019s findings and conclusions concerning the petitioner\u2019s medical condition in 2005 and no evidence whatsoever supporting its determination of deliberate indifference on the part of the respondent, I respectfully dissent from the majority opinion. The habeas court was not entitled to substitute its own speculation for the lack of any evidence to support its conclusions. I respectfully submit that the actions of the habeas court, in determining that the petitioner had a serious medical condition and that the respondent was culpable, on the basis of its personal views, without a shred of evidence in support, and in reliance on an entirely extraneous matter, was improper and should be reversed.</p>\n<p id=\"b49-5\">For the foregoing reasons, I respectfully dissent.</p>\n<footnote label=\"1\">\n<p id=\"b48-7\"> The petitioner entered into evidence (1) the results of a November 13, 1992 CT scan of his back; (2) a March 27, 2000 diagnostic radiological report about his spine; (3) a utilization review report from the utilization management unit of the University of Connecticut; (4) a summary of the October 15,2003 MRI procedure; and (5) an April 16,2003 hearing transcript.</p>\n</footnote>\n</opinion>\n</casebody>\n",
