We affirm the decision of the board.</p>\n<p id=\"b80-6\">The following facts were found by the commissioner. At all relevant times, the plaintiff was a deputy fire chief for the department. Members of the department were required to pass annual physical examinations, but there were no additional physical fitness requirements for the department. Although the department did not have a structured physical fitness program, it arranged a weekly open gymnasium basketball program for the exclusive participation of its members. The program was voluntary, but department leadership encouraged its members to participate by announcing the program over department radio and by posting information about it in each of the two department firehouses. The chief of the department characterized the basketball program as a \u201cloosely organized physical fitness program [that] is also recreational.\u201d<footnotemark>2</footnotemark></p>\n<p id=\"b81-5\"><page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"55\">*55</page-number>On April 23, 2001, the plaintiff injured his knee while playing basketball in the department\u2019s basketball program. The chief of the department described the plaintiffs injury as \u201chaving occurred while he was participating in the voluntary fire department sponsored open gym (physical fitness program).\u201d The plaintiff subsequently filed a claim for workers\u2019 compensation benefits. After formal hearings on October 31,2002, and April 15 and June 23,2003, the commissioner determined that the plaintiff was a member of the department at the time of his injury. The commissioner further concluded that the defendants, the town of Watertown and RSKCo Services, Inc., the town\u2019s insurer, were required to pay the plaintiff workers\u2019 compensation benefits because the department\u2019s basketball program constituted training pursuant to \u00a7 7-314a. The defendants appealed to the board from the commissioner\u2019s finding and award. The board reversed the commissioner\u2019s decision, concluding that the department\u2019s basketball program did not constitute training within the meaning of \u00a7 7-314a and that consequently, the plaintiff was not entitled to workers\u2019 compensation benefits. The plaintiff now appeals from the board\u2019s decision.</p>\n<p id=\"b81-6\">\u201cThe principles that govern our standard of review in workers\u2019 compensation appeals are well established. The conclusions drawn by [the commissioner] from the facts found must stand unless they result from an incorrect application of the law to the subordinate facts or from an inference illegally or unreasonably drawn from them. ... It is well established that [although not dispositive, we accord great weight to the construction given to the workers\u2019 compensation statutes by the commissioner and review board. ... A state agency is not entitled, however, to special deference when its determination of a question of law has not previously been subject to judicial scrutiny. . . . Where [a work<page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"56\">*56</page-number>ers\u2019 compensation] appeal involves an issue of statutory construction that has not yet been subjected to judicial scrutiny, this court has plenary power to review the administrative decision.\u201d (Internal quotation marks omitted.) <em>Labadie </em>v. <em>Norwalk Rehabilitation Services, Inc., </em>274 Conn. 219, 227, 875 A.2d 485 (2005). The issue of what constitutes \u201ctraining\u201d under \u00a7 7-314a presents an issue of first impression. Accordingly, our review of the board\u2019s decision is plenary.</p>\n<p id=\"b82-6\">The plaintiff argues that the board improperly reversed the commissioner\u2019s decision. The plaintiff claims that the meaning of \u00a7 7-314a is clear and unambiguous and that as a result, the terms used in that statute should be given their plain and ordinary meaning. The plaintiff further argues that the plain and ordinary meaning of the term \u201ctraining,\u201d as used in that statute, refers to fitness and physical training, rather than training for fire duties, as the board concluded. We disagree with the plaintiff.<footnotemark>3</footnotemark></p>\n<p id=\"b82-7\">We note at the outset that, unlike other workers, volunteer firefighters are entitled to benefits under the Workers\u2019 Compensation Act (act); General Statutes \u00a7 31-275 et seq.; only if their injury satisfies the conditions specifically set forth in \u00a7 7-314a (a).<footnotemark>4</footnotemark> Our resolu<page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"57\">*57</page-number>tion ol! the plaintiffs appeal is therefore guided by this provision.</p>\n<p id=\"b83-6\">Whether the plaintiff is entitled to workers\u2019 compensation benefits depends on the definition of the term \u201ctraining\u201d as used in \u00a7 7-314a (a). \u201cWhen construing a statute, [o]ur fundamental objective is to ascertain and give effect to the apparent intent of the legislature. . . . In other words, we seek to determine, in a reasoned manner, the meaning of the statutory language as applied to the facts of [the] case, including the question of whether the language actually does apply. ... In seeking to determine that meaning, General Statutes \u00a7 l-2z directs us first to consider the text of the statute itself and its relationship to other statutes. If, after examining such text and considering such relationship, the meaning of such text is plain and unambiguous and does not yield absurd or unworkable results, extratextual evidence of the meaning of the statute shall not be considered.\u201d (Internal quotation marks omitted.) <em>Cogan </em>v. <em>Chase Manhattan Auto Financial Corp., </em>276 Conn. 1, 7, 882 A.2d 597 (2005). \u201cFurthermore, we recognize that [i]f there is no ambiguity in the language of the statute, it does not become ambiguous merely because the parties contend for different meanings.\u201d (Internal quotation marks omitted.) <em>Wannagot </em>v. <em>Shelton, </em>38 Conn. App. 754, 760-61, 662 A.2d 1345, cert. denied, 235 Conn. 919, 920, 665 A.2d 908 (1995).</p>\n<p id=\"b83-7\">We thus begin with the text of \u00a7 7-314a (a), which provides in relevant part: \u201c[A]ctive members of volunteer fire departments . . . shall be construed to be employees of the municipality for the benefit of which <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"58\">*58</page-number>volunteer fire services . . . are rendered while <em>in training or engaged in volunteer fire duty . . </em>. and shall be subject to the jurisdiction of the Workers\u2019 Compensation Commission and shall be compensated in accordance with the provisions of [the act] for death, disability or injury incurred while <em>in training for or engaged in volunteer fire duty </em>. . . .\u201d (Emphasis added.)</p>\n<p id=\"b84-6\">The plaintiff focuses on the first use of the term \u201cin training\u201d and argues that \u201cin training\u201d and \u201cengaged in volunteer fire duty\u201d are separate and distinct activities. The plaintiff claims that rather than modifying the phrase \u201cengaged in volunteer fire duty,\u201d \u201cin training\u201d refers to fitness and physical training. While this may be a plausible reading of \u201cin training\u201d as it is first used in \u00a7 7-314a (a), it ignores the second use of the term, which is the more important use for our purposes.</p>\n<p id=\"b84-7\">The first clause of this subsection creates a presumption that active members of volunteer fire departments are employees of the municipality that they serve for purposes of \u00a7 7-314a. Our Supreme Court has recognized that this statute \u201ccreated a fictitious relationship of employer-employee between volunteer firemen and the municipality ... to ensure the payment of benefits to volunteer firemen similar to those provided for regular firemen.\u201d <em>Going </em>v. <em>Cromwell Fire District, </em>159 Conn. 53, 60, 267 A.2d 428 (1970). Whether the plaintiff was \u201cin training or engaged in volunteer fire duty\u201d so as to qualify as an employee of the town for purposes of \u00a7 7-314a (a) is not an issue in this appeal, however, because the board\u2019s decision was based on the conclusion that the plaintiffs injury did not satisfy the second clause of this subsection, relating to when volunteer firefighters covered by the statute are entitled to workers\u2019 compensation benefits. Accordingly, the plaintiffs reliance on his interpretation of the first clause of \u00a7 7-314a (a) to resolve the issue before us is misplaced.</p>\n<p id=\"b85-5\"><page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"59\">*59</page-number>Most important to our resolution of the plaintiffs claim is the second clause in \u00a7 7-314a (a), which provides benefits to volunteer firefighters for injuries \u201cincurred while <em>in training for </em>or engaged in volunteer fire duty . . . .\u201d (Emphasis added.) General Statutes \u00a7 7-314a (a). Ordinary rules of English grammar dictate that the prepositional phrase \u201cin training for\u201d must modify a verb, noun or adjective. See Random House Webster\u2019s Unabridged Dictionary (2d Ed. 2001) (defining preposition as \u201cany member of a class of words . . . used before nouns, pronouns and other substantives to form phrases functioning as modifiers of verbs, nouns, or adjectives\u201d). If we were to apply the plaintiffs argument to the second clause of \u00a7 7-314a (a), thereby treating \u201cin training for\u201d and \u201cengaged in volunteer fire duty\u201d separately, the word \u201cfor\u201d would not modify any other verb, noun or adjective. Such a construction is not only strained, but it would violate a cardinal principle of statutory construction that \u201cthe legislature [does] not intend to enact meaningless provisions. . . . [Statutes must be construed, if possible, such that no clause, sentence or word shall be superfluous, void or insignificant . . . .\u201d (Internal quotation marks omitted.) <em>Semerzakis </em>v. <em>Commissioner of Social Services, </em>274 Conn. 1, 18, 873 A.2d 911 (2005).</p>\n<p id=\"b85-6\">In addition to the grammatical structure of the phrase, the dictionary definition of the word \u201ctraining\u201d supports the board\u2019s conclusion that the term refers to training directly related to firefighting rather than to general physical fitness. The primary definition of training is \u201cthe education, instruction, or discipline of a person . . . that is being trained.\u201d Random House Webster\u2019s Unabridged Dictionary, supra. When the phrase \u201cin training for\u201d is read as modifying \u201cvolunteer fire duty,\u201d we understand it to mean the education, instruction or discipline of a person that is being trained in fire duties, which are defined more specifically in <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"60\">*60</page-number>General Statutes \u00a7 7-314 (a). That subsection provides in relevant part that fire duties include \u201cduties performed while at fires, while answering alarms of fire, while answering calls for mutual aid assistance, while returning from calls for mutual aid assistance, while directly returning from fires, while at fire drills or parades, while going directly to or returning directly from fire drills or parades, while at tests or trials of any apparatus or equipment normally used by the fire department, while going directly to or returning directly from such tests or trials, while instructing or being instructed in fire duties, while answering or returning from ambulance calls where the ambulance service is part of the fire service, while answering or returning from fire department emergency calls and any other duty ordered to be performed by a superior or commanding officer in the fire department . . . .\u201d General Statutes \u00a7 7-314 (a). Nothing in this definition persuades us that training for fire duties means training for the general physical demands of the position, as opposed to learning about and practicing the skills associated with fighting fires. Although we acknowledge that firefighting requires a certain degree of physical fitness, we are unable to conclude that members of volunteer fire departments are entitled to workers\u2019 compensation for injuries sustained while they are engaged in purely voluntary physical fitness activities.</p>\n<p id=\"b86-6\">The decision of the workers\u2019 compensation review board is affirmed.</p>\n<p id=\"b86-7\">In this opinion SCHALLER, J., concurred.</p>\n<footnote label=\"1\">\n<p id=\"b80-7\"> General Statutes \u00a7 7-314a (a) provides in relevant part: \u201c[Ajctive members of volunteer fire departments and active members of organizations certified as a volunteer ambulance service in accordance with section 19a-180 shall be construed to be employees of the municipality for the benefit of which volunteer fire services or such ambulance services are rendered while in training or engaged in volunteer fire duty or such ambulance service and shall be subject to the jurisdiction of the Workers\u2019 Compensation Commission and shall be compensated in accordance with the provisions of chapter 568 for death, disability or injury incurred while in training for or engaged in volunteer fire duty or such ambulance service.\u201d</p>\n</footnote>\n<footnote label=\"2\">\n<p id=\"b80-8\"> In addition, members who participated in the basketball program earned points toward retirement benefits. There also was evidence in the record, however, that members of the department earned points toward retirement benefits for all department sponsored events, including the basketball program and department clambakes.</p>\n</footnote>\n<footnote label=\"3\">\n<p id=\"b82-8\"> The plaintiff also claims that the board acted improperly by reversing the commissioner\u2019s factual findings. The board\u2019s decision, however, was based on legal conclusions regarding the definition of the term \u201ctraining\u201d and whether the basketball game at issue constituted training in accordance with General Statutes \u00a7 7~314a (a). \u201cThe question of whether a particular statute . . . applies to a given state of facts is a question of statutory interpretation .... Statutory interpretation presents a question of law for the court.\u201d (Internal quotation marks omitted.) <em>Emerick </em>v. <em>Kuhn, </em>52 Conn.

See, e.g., <em>Anderton </em>v. <em>Wasteaway Services, LLC, </em>91 Conn. App. 345, 880 A.2d 1003 (2005) (employee entitled <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"57\">*57</page-number>to benefits for injury sustained during basketball game arranged by employer during work hours); <em>Brown </em>v. <em>Dept. of Correction, </em>89 Conn.

J.,</author>\n<p id=\"A_K\">dissenting. I respectfully disagree with the conclusion of the majority that the participation by the plaintiff, David Hardt, in the open gymnasium program (program) arranged by the Watertown volunteer fire department (department) for the exclusive use <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"61\">*61</page-number>of its members did not constitute training for volunteer fire duty under General Statutes \u00a7 7-314a (a). Accordingly, I would reverse the decision of the workers\u2019 compensation review board and remand the matter with direction to reinstate the finding of compensability by the workers\u2019 compensation commissioner.</p>\n<p id=\"b87-6\">Under \u00a7 7-314a (a), active members of volunteer fire departments may seek compensation with the workers\u2019 compensation commission only for death, disability or injury incurred while in training for or engaged in volunteer fire duty. It is undisputed that the plaintiff was not engaged in volunteer fire duty at the time of injury. The question, then, is whether the plaintiff was training for his fire duties by participating in the program.</p>\n<p id=\"b87-7\">Among the fire duties enumerated in General Statutes \u00a7 7-314 (a) are duties performed while at fires and duties performed while answering alarms of fire. The work of a firefighter is extraordinary in its danger and exhausting in its physical demands.<footnotemark>1</footnotemark> As one firefighter observed, \u201c[a]ll of us in this station have been on calls where somebody\u2019s been carried out of a burning building on a firefighter\u2019s back.\u201d (Internal quotation marks omitted.) <em>Ramos </em>v. Branford, Superior Court, judicial district of New Haven, Docket No. 407617 (December 17, 1999), aff'd, 63 Conn. App. 671, 778 A.2d 972 (2001).</p>\n<p id=\"b87-8\">It thus is axiomatic that physical fitness is a prerequisite to adequate performance of fire duties. For that reason, volunteer firefighters in Watertown, like those in other municipalities, are required to pass annual <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"62\">*62</page-number>physical examinations. Accordingly, I would conclude that, in certain circumstances, physical fitness programs may constitute training for volunteer fire duty. In my mind, the present case is such an instance.</p>\n<p id=\"b88-6\">The record reveals that the program was exclusive to department members. The department organized and regularly promoted the program, and it encouraged participation therein by its members. The chief of the department characterized the program as a \u201cphysical fitness program which is also recreational,\u201d and the commissioner found that the program was sponsored by the department \u201cto promote physical fitness among [its] members . . . .\u201d The commissioner further found that \u201c[t]he major purpose of the program was not recreational.\u201d Under these circumstances, I would conclude that participation in this particular physical fitness program constitutes training for volunteer fire duty. Because the plaintiff sustained his injury while participating in the program, the protections of \u00a7 7-314a (a) should apply.</p>\n<footnote label=\"1\">\n<p id=\"b87-9\"> Consider the following example: \u201cOn March 5, 1987, the plaintiff, a captain in the Southington fire department, attempted to rescue four people trapped in a burning building. In the course of his search, the plaintiff, after injuring his ribs, exhausted his portable air supply. Then, while crawling along the floor, he rolled over and found himself lying on the body of a dead child. At this point the plaintiff believed that his death was imminent. He managed, however, to make his way out of the building to safety.\u201d <em>Skrzypiec </em>v. <em>Noonan, </em>228 Conn. 1, 4-5, 633 A.2d 716 (1993).</p>\n</footnote>\n</opinion>\n</casebody>\n",
