General Statutes \u00a7 45U-186.<footnotemark>1</footnotemark> The narrow issue in this probate appeal is whether the status of being an heir is, without additional facts, sufficient to establish aggrievement. The broader issue is whether, if that status is insufficient, the heir may remedy this defect in her appeal by moving to amend the notice of appeal required by General Statutes \u00a7 45a-191.<footnotemark>2</footnotemark> In dismissing the heir\u2019s appeal, the trial court relied on older case law holding that a defective notice of appeal can never be amended. See <em>Feigner </em>v. <em>Gopstein, </em>139 Conn. 738, 741, 97 A.2d 267 (1953); <em>Exchange Buffet Corp. </em>v. <em>Rogers, </em>139 Conn. 374, 377-78, 94 A.2d 22 (1952). We must decide whether those cases continue to have precedential force after <em>Baskin\u2019s Appeal from Probate, </em>194 Conn. 635, 640-41, 484 A.2d 934 (1984). Because we conclude <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"557\">*557</page-number>that the procedural rules governing a probate appeal now are those stated in <em>Baskin\u2019s Appeal from Probate, </em>we reverse the judgment of the trial court.</p>\n<p id=\"b583-4\">After receiving permission from the Southbury Probate Court on November 4, 2004, the plaintiff, Holly Flor, brought an appeal to the Superior Court from an order of the Probate Court approving the final accounting of the defendant, Michael R. Pohl, conservator of the estate of Patricia Ann Schuetz. The plaintiff, who is Schuetz\u2019 daughter, had been permitted to challenge the validity of the accounting in the Probate Court, but was unsuccessful on the merits. In her notice of appeal to the Superior Court, the plaintiff identified herself as an heir at law and alleged that she was \u201caggrieved by the order and decree of the Probate Court.\u201d The defendant filed a timely motion to dismiss in which he alleged that the plaintiff had failed to establish her aggrievement because her notice of appeal did not comply with the requirement of \u00a7 45a-191 that she state her interest in the subject matter of the probate order.</p>\n<p id=\"b583-5\">At a hearing on the defendant\u2019s motion, it became clear that Schuetz had died before the completion of the final accounting. The defendant virtually conceded that, if this fact had been pleaded in the notice of appeal, the plaintiff would have established her aggrievement.<footnotemark>3</footnotemark> Although the defect in the plaintiffs appeal was, therefore, \u201ctechnical,\u201d the defendant maintained that the plaintiffs appeal was subject to dismissal for lack of a showing of aggrievement.</p>\n<p id=\"b584-5\"><page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"558\">*558</page-number>The trial court granted the defendant\u2019s motion to dismiss. It observed that, pursuant to \u00a7\u00a7 45a-186 and 45a-191, a probate appeal is subject to dismissal for lack of a showing of aggrievement unless the notice of appeal identifies the appellant\u2019s interest in the subject matter of the decree and the adverse effect of the decree on the interest. It then held that \u201c[f]ailure to meet those requirements makes the appeal subject to a motion to dismiss, and insufficiency of the appeal cannot be cured in the Superior Court by amendment or by offering testimony to overcome a defect apparent on the face of the appeal. <em>Exchange Buffet Corp. </em>v. <em>Rogers, </em>[supra, 139 Conn. 377-78].\u201d The court also cited <em>Hartford Kosher Caterers, Inc. </em>v. <em>Gazda, </em>165 Conn. 478, 482, 338 A.2d 497 (1973), and <em>Feigner </em>v. <em>Gopstein, </em>supra, 139 Conn. 738.</p>\n<p id=\"b584-6\">The court\u2019s description of these cases is entirely accurate. The defendant, however, mischaracterizes their import. Failure fully to describe a claimant\u2019s interest in a probate decree is not a flaw that deprives the Superior Court of subject matter jurisdiction. Although aggrievement is a jurisdictional necessity, without which the Superior Court cannot hear a probate appeal, \u201c[i]f an appellant is aggrieved but fails to show the basis for that aggrievement in the motion to appeal, the appeal is merely voidable.\u201d <em>Hartford Kosher Caterers, Inc. </em>v. <em>Gazda, </em>supra, 165 Conn. 483. Nonetheless, in this case, the defendant timely moved to avail himself of the opportunity to void the plaintiffs appeal.</p>\n<p id=\"b584-7\">We assume, for the purposes of this appeal, that the trial court properly held that being an heir does not automatically establish aggrievement for the purposes of a probate appeal. See, e.g., <em>Fitzhugh </em>v. <em>Fitzhugh, </em>156 Conn. 625, 239 A.2d 513 (1968); <em>Graham </em>v. <em>Estate of Graham, </em>2 Conn. App. 251, 477 A.2d 158, cert. denied, 194 Conn. 805, 482 A.2d 710 (1984).</p>\n<p id=\"b585-5\"><page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"559\">*559</page-number>The question remains, however, whether the cases holding that an appellant from probate has no right to move to amend a notice of appeal to demonstrate aggrievement continue to be good law. Only recently, our Supreme Court in <em>McBurney </em>v. <em>Cirillo, </em>276 Conn. 782, 889 A.2d 759 (2006), reiterated its capacious view of the law of standing by observing: \u201cThe concept of standing, as presented by the question of aggrievement, is a practical and functional one designed to assure that only those with a genuine and legitimate interest can appeal an order of the Probate Court. ... In order to establish standing to appeal from a probate matter, a party must show that he or she is aggrieved by any order, denial or decree of a court of probate in any matter, unless otherwise specially provided by law .... The test for determining whether a party has been aggrieved by a Probate Court decision is whether there is a possibility, as distinguished from a certainty, that some legally protected interest that [the party] has in the estate has been adversely affected. . . . This interest may be a direct pecuniary one, or it may consist of an injurious effect upon some legally protected right or status of the appellant.\u201d (Citations omitted; internal quotation marks omitted.) Id., 820-21. It is hard to square this view of the role of probate appeals with insistence on formal pleading niceties.</p>\n<p id=\"b585-6\">We need not, however, speculate about the relationship between McBumey\u2019s view of aggrievement and the trial court\u2019s reliance on cases such as <em>Exchange Buffet Corp. </em>Although the trial court also cited <em>Baskin\u2019s Appeal from Probate, </em>supra, 194 Conn. 635, it failed to take into account a significant holding in that case.</p>\n<p id=\"b585-7\">The Supreme Court\u2019s opinion in <em>Baskin\u2019s Appeal from Probate </em>begins with the observation that \u201c[t]he nature of an appeal from probate underwent a substantial change with the decision of this court in <em>Prince </em>v. <em>Sheffield, </em>158 Conn. 286, 259 A.2d 621 (1969). There, this <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"560\">*560</page-number>court clearly established that an appeal from probate is a de novo proceeding in which the Superior Court is not limited to the claims raised in the Probate Court. \u2018In an appeal from probate there is a trial de novo in which the appellant has the opportunity to present any evidence which could have been offered in the probate court, whether or not it was actually offered.\u2019 <em>Prince </em>v. <em>Sheffield, </em>supra, 294. \u2018In the traditional appeal, the scope of review is limited by the issues raised and the supportive evidence submitted in the lower court. In an appeal from probate, however, the informalities of the probate proceeding are corrected by permitting a full hearing in which new evidence may be submitted.\u2019 <em>Thomas </em>v. <em>Arafeh, </em>174 Conn. 464, 470, 391 A.2d 133 (1978). This court has gone so far as to allow the admission of evidence not even in existence at the time of the probate hearing.\u201d <em>Baskin\u2019s Appeal from Probate, </em>supra, 194 Conn. 641.</p>\n<p id=\"b586-6\">The Supreme Court then went on to describe the proceedings in the case before it. \u201cThe dismissal of this appeal foreclosed any opportunity to amend the reasons of appeal to plead additional facts that would establish a claim that the decedent had been abandoned by [his] widow, as provided in the second sentence of [General Statutes] \u00a7 45-253 [now General Statutes \u00a7 45a-318], as a basis for an order concerning the custody and control of the decedent\u2019s remains. During oral argument, it was not disputed that such a claim had been made in the Probate Court. It would have been possible for the plaintiff to amend his reasons of appeal to include such a claim. Since our decision in <em>Prince, the ability to amend the reasons of appeal accompanying the initiation of an appeal from probate is indistinguishable from the ability to amend pleadings in other civil actions in accordance with the appropriate sections of the Practice Book. The reasons of appeal serve essentially the same functions in defining issues and lim</em><page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"561\">*561</page-number><em>iting evidence as does the complaint in any civil matter. . . . </em>This conclusion is supported by Practice Book \u00a7 194 [now \u00a7 10-76 (a)] and is a necessary consequence of the principles declared in <em>Prince.\u201d </em>(Citation omitted; emphasis added.) Id., 641-43.</p>\n<p id=\"b587-6\">Finally, the Supreme Court discussed the propriety of filing a motion to dismiss to challenge a probate appeal. It noted \u201cthe difference between a motion to strike and a motion to dismiss in relation to an appeal from probate\u201d and held that \u201cwhere the question is merely the sufficiency of the pleading rather than the existence of a viable cause of action,\u201d a motion to dismiss should be denied. Id., 643.</p>\n<p id=\"b587-7\">It follows that, in this case, as in <em>Baskin\u2019s Appeal from Probate, </em>the defendant\u2019s motion to dismiss should have been denied because the plaintiff should have been afforded an opportunity to amend her appeal. We disagree with the defendant\u2019s claim that this case is governed by <em>Graham </em>v. <em>Estate of Graham, </em>supra, 2 Conn. App. 251. Although <em>Graham </em>also involved an heir\u2019s challenge to the accounting rendered by a conservator, it is significantly different because, in that case, the mother\u2019s rights were restored and the conservator-ship was terminated before the final accounting, from which the mother did not appeal. Id., 252. Here, by contrast, it appears that only the plaintiff presently has an interest to challenge the defendant\u2019s accounting for his conservatorship of the property of the plaintiff\u2019s deceased mother.</p>\n<p id=\"b587-8\">The judgment is reversed and the case is remanded for further proceedings in accordance with law.</p>\n<p id=\"b587-9\">In this opinion the other judges concurred.</p>\n<footnote label=\"1\">\n<p id=\"b582-11\"> General Statutes \u00a7 45a-186 (a) provides in relevant part: \u201cAny person aggrieved by any order, denial or decree of a court of probate in any matter, unless otherwise specially provided by law, may appeal therefrom to the Superior Court in accordance with subsection (b) of this section. . . .\u201d</p>\n</footnote>\n<footnote label=\"2\">\n<p id=\"b582-12\"> General Statutes \u00a7 45a-191 provides: \u201cIn each appeal from probate or from the actions of commissioners, the interest of the appellant shall be stated in the motion for appeal, unless such interest appears on the face of the proceedings and records of such court of probate.\u201d</p>\n</footnote>\n<footnote label=\"3\">\n<p id=\"b583-6\"> Referring to the fact of Schuetz\u2019 death, the defendant stated: \u201cUnfortunately, that\u2019s what she should have said in the motion for permission to appeal. That would have set forth what her interest was. They didn\u2019t do that. That\u2019s the gist of my motion to dismiss, that the statute requires you to set forth what your interest is in the motion for appeal, and it isn\u2019t there. The mere fact that you allege to be an heir at law is not enough. That\u2019s what the cases clearly state. So, I think that\u2019s the answer for that. We are really looking at . . . whether there has been a technical compliance [with] the requirements of the statute, and it just isn\u2019t there.\u201d</p>\n</footnote>\n</opinion>\n</casebody>\n",
