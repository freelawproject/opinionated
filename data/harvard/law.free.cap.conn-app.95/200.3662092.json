On appeal, the plaintiff claims that the court improperly (1) relied on his gross <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"202\">*202</page-number>income rather than his net income in fashioning the unallocated child support and alimony order, (2) ordered postmajority child support in violation of General Statutes \u00a7 46b-84, (3) awarded lifetime alimony, (4) awarded the defendant 50 percent of the plaintiffs stock options and restricted stock, and (5) considered the plaintiffs bonus that was paid in early 2004 as both a source of income and as an asset. The plaintiff also claims that the totality of the court\u2019s orders constituted an abuse of discretion. We affirm the judgment of the trial court.</p>\n<p id=\"b228-5\">The following facts and procedural history are relevant to our resolution of the plaintiffs appeal. The parties were married on September 10, 1994. They are the parents of three children, all minors. Claiming an irretievable breakdown in the marital relationship, the plaintiff brought this dissolution action by a complaint dated August 9, 2001. He sought dissolution of the marriage, joint custody of the minor children and a division of the marital assets. The defendant admitted the allegations in the plaintiffs complaint and filed a cross complaint in which she sought dissolution of the marriage, sole custody of the minor children, child support, alimony and a division of the marital assets.</p>\n<p id=\"b228-6\">By memorandum of decision filed June 18, 2004, the court dissolved the parties\u2019 marriage and issued financial orders.<footnotemark>1</footnotemark> The plaintiff timely filed a motion to reargue, which was denied on July 28, 2004. This appeal followed.</p>\n<p id=\"b228-7\">As a preliminary matter, we set forth our standard of review. \u201cAn appellate court will not disturb a trial court\u2019s orders [financial or otherwise] in domestic rela<page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"203\">*203</page-number>tions cases unless the court has abused its discretion or it is found that it could not reasonably conclude as it did, based on the facts presented. ... In determining whether a trial court has abused its broad discretion in domestic relations matters, we allow every reasonable presumption in favor of the correctness of its action. . . . We apply that standard of review because it reflects the sound policy that the trial court has the unique opportunity to view the parties and their testimony, and is therefore in the best position to assess all of the circumstances surrounding a dissolution action, including such factors as the demeanor and the attitude of the parties.\u201d (Citation omitted; internal quotation marks omitted.) <em>Dombrowski </em>v. <em>Noyes-Dombrowski, </em>273 Conn. 127, 132, 869 A.2d 164 (2005). Mindful of these principles, we turn to the issues at hand.</p>\n<p id=\"b229-5\">I</p>\n<p id=\"b229-6\">The plaintiffs first three claims relate to the court\u2019s order of unallocated alimony and child support. The court ordered, inter alia: \u201cThe plaintiff shall pay unallocated periodic alimony and child support of 40 percent of the first $400,000 of his cash earnings in each year, 30 percent of the next $300,000 of cash earnings and 10 percent of the next $150,000 of cash earnings. Such earnings shall not include other forms of compensation such as stock options, restricted stock, [deferred profit sharing and employee stock ownership plans], capital accumulation plan or any other incentive awards. Payments shall be made monthly utilizing his base salary and the most recent cash bonuses paid for the prior year. Payments shall be made until the death of either party, the defendant\u2019s remarriage or her cohabitation as defined by [General Statutes \u00a7 46b-86 (b)] and case law. This order is modifiable as to amount and is indefinite as to term subject to the limitations aforesaid. A wage withholding is entered.\u201d We address the plaintiffs three claims regarding this order in turn.</p>\n<p id=\"b230-4\"><page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"204\">*204</page-number>A</p>\n<p id=\"b230-5\">The plaintiff first claims that the court improperly relied on his gross income rather than on his net income in fashioning the unallocated alimony and child support order. Specifically, the plaintiff claims that because the court referred only to gross income and did not mention net income in its memorandum of decision, its order was based solely on gross income and was therefore improper. We disagree.</p>\n<p id=\"b230-6\">The parties acknowledge that the principle of law governing this issue is clear. It is well settled that a court must base its child support and alimony orders on the available net income of the parties, not gross income. <em>Collette </em>v. <em>Collette, </em>177 Conn. 465, 469, 418 A.2d 891 (1979). Whether or not an order falls within this prescription must be analyzed on a case-by-case basis. Thus, while our decisional law in this regard consistently affirms the basic tenet that support and alimony orders must be based on net income, the proper application of this principle is context specific.</p>\n<p id=\"b230-7\">In <em>Morris </em>v. <em>Morris, </em>262 Conn. 299, 811 A.2d 1283 (2003), our Supreme Court reversed the judgment of the trial court because, in that instance, the court <em>expressly </em>relied on the parties\u2019 gross incomes in modifying the defendant\u2019s child support obligation. The <em>Morris </em>court concluded: \u201cAlthough the court broadly stated that its support order was based on financial affidavits, the court, nonetheless, expressly and affirmatively stated that the defendant has the following <em>gross </em>amounts which are properly included in his support income consideration . . . .\u201d (Emphasis added; internal quotation marks omitted.) Id., 307.</p>\n<p id=\"b230-8\">In <em>Ludgin </em>v. <em>McGowan, </em>64 Conn. App. 355, 358-59, 780 A.2d 198 (2001), this court reversed the judgment of the trial court because the court based its financial orders on the parties\u2019 gross incomes. There, we stated: <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"205\">*205</page-number>\u201c[T]he court repeatedly referred to and compared the parties\u2019 gross incomes. . . . Although the court had before it evidence of the parties\u2019 net incomes, it appears that the court chose not to rely on such information. The court\u2019s memorandum of decision is devoid of any mention of the parties\u2019 net incomes.\u201d (Internal quotation marks omitted.) Id.</p>\n<p id=\"b231-5\">In <em>Greco </em>v. <em>Greco, </em>82 Conn. App. 768, 773, 847 A.2d 1017 (2004), aff'd, 275 Conn. 348, 880 A.2d 872 (2005), this court reversed the trial court\u2019s alimony order, which was based on gross income, even though the trial court did not affirmatively and expressly state that it had relied on the parties\u2019 gross incomes. In <em>Greco, </em>however, it was clear that the court relied solely on gross income because the financial orders far exceeded the obligor\u2019s available net income. Thus, the orders logically could only have been based on gross income.</p>\n<p id=\"b231-6\">In <em>Kelman </em>v. <em>Kelman, </em>86 Conn. App. 120, 123, 860 A.2d 292 (2004), cert. denied, 273 Conn. 911, 870 A.2d 1079 (2005), although the trial court made reference to the parties\u2019 gross incomes in its decision, it did not expressly state that it was relying solely on gross earnings in framing its order. In affirming the trial court\u2019s decision, this court stated: \u201c[T]he court specifically stated that it took into account the relevant statutes, the parties\u2019 testimony, the financial affidavits and the child support guideline worksheets, which included the parties\u2019 net incomes.\u201d Id., 123-24.</p>\n<p id=\"b231-7\">Although the records in <em>Morris, Ludgin </em>and <em>Greco </em>supported the conclusions in those cases that the trial court\u2019s financial orders were based solely on the parties\u2019 gross incomes and not their net incomes, the record in this case does not compel such a conclusion. The case at hand is more analogous to <em>Kelman. </em>Although, in <em>Kelman, </em>the court\u2019s memorandum of decision referenced the parties\u2019 gross incomes, it did not state that <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"206\">*206</page-number>it was relying <em>solely </em>on their gross incomes in fashioning its orders. Id., 123. As in <em>Kelman, </em>the mere notation by the court of a party\u2019s gross earnings is not fatal to its support and alimony orders so long as its orders are not based on the parties\u2019 gross earnings.</p>\n<p id=\"b232-5\">In this case, the court noted the plaintiffs gross earnings to demonstrate their scope and variability in order to explain its reasoning for fashioning an order framed as a percentage of the plaintiffs gross earnings. The court stated: \u201cThe court lists the gross earnings of the plaintiff to illustrate the capability and ability he has displayed and the pay he has received for his efforts. Since his earned income fluctuates from year to year, the court will provide for a formula for the periodic alimony and child support. Each party has submitted a proposal in this respect in their proposed orders.\u201d Indeed, the plaintiffs proposed orders, filed on April 21, 2004, suggest an unallocated alimony and child support order on the basis of his gross annual cash compensation from employment.<footnotemark>2</footnotemark> The court further noted the gross and net values of the plaintiffs most recent cash bonus. Throughout its decision, the court made frequent reference to the parties\u2019 financial affidavits. The court <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"207\">*207</page-number>also considered the tax returns, which disclosed not only the plaintiffs gross income, but also his total tax liability and, thus, his net disposable income. The court had before it ample evidence from which it could determine the plaintiffs net income and the respective financial needs and abilities of each party.</p>\n<p id=\"b233-5\">It is noteworthy, too, that the court also expressly considered the parties\u2019 proposed orders in which both parties proposed that the alimony and child support order should be unallocated and should be a function of the plaintiffs gross income. Although the court listed the plaintiffs gross earnings, taken from his tax returns for the years 1997 through 2003, unlike in <em>Morris, </em>the court here did not state that it <em>relied </em>on the plaintiffs gross earnings to form the basis of the order. Rather, the court merely referred to the plaintiffs gross income to demonstrate his ability to pay support. Finally, the fact that the alimony and support order was ultimately a function of gross income does not, alone, stand for the proposition that the order was based on gross income. Here, we differentiate between an order that is a function of gross income and one that is based on gross income. In this regard, we note that we have found no case in which an order for support or alimony has been reversed on review simply because it was expressed as a function of a party\u2019s gross income. We believe that the term \u201cbased\u201d as used in this context connotes an order that only takes into consideration the parties\u2019 gross income and not the parties\u2019 net income. Consequently, an order that takes cognizance of the parties\u2019 disposable incomes may be proper even if it is expressed as a function of the parties\u2019 gross earnings.</p>\n<p id=\"b233-6\">We note that, unlike in <em>Kelman, </em>the court in this case did not specifically reference the criteria used in making its decision. Our Supreme Court has repeatedly held, however, that the trial court is not required to make specific reference to the criteria that it considered in <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"208\">*208</page-number>making its decision. See, e.g., <em>Dombrowski </em>v. <em>Noyes-Dombrowski, </em>supra, 273 Conn. 137. Although we recognize that an order need not affirmatively or expressly state that the court is relying solely on gross income for that order to be improper, we are similarly of the opinion that a trial court need not expressly state that it has considered the appropriate factors in reaching its decision. According the court every reasonable presumption in favor of the correctness of its decision, we assume that the court considered the appropriate statutory and evidentiary underpinnings in fashioning its financial orders. See <em>Febbroriello </em>v. <em>Febbroriello, </em>21 Conn. App. 200, 203, 572 A.2d 1032 (1990). Although the court did not expressly state that it considered the plaintiffs net income in determining the financial orders, we infer that the court considered the relevant statutory factors and all of the evidence submitted by the parties. Therefore, we cannot conclude that the court abused its discretion in fashioning the support order.</p>\n<p id=\"b234-5\">B</p>\n<p id=\"b234-6\">The plaintiff next claims that the support order, by its terms, provides for child support beyond the age of majority and is thus beyond the jurisdiction of the court. Specifically, the plaintiff claims that the order must contain a step-down to coincide with each child reaching the age of majority. We disagree.</p>\n<p id=\"b234-7\">As a general matter, \u201c[t]he obligation of a parent to support a child terminates when the child attains the age of majority, which, in this state, is eighteen. General Statutes \u00a7 1-1d; <em>Kennedy </em>v. <em>Kennedy, </em>177 Conn. 47, 52, 411 A.2d 25 (1979).<footnotemark>3</footnotemark> The statutory grant of jurisdiction <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"209\">*209</page-number>to the Superior Court in matters relating to child support incident to the dissolution of a marriage<footnotemark>4</footnotemark> likewise expressly circumscribes the court\u2019s jurisdiction to orders involving only \u2018minor children.\u2019 \u201d <em>Cariseo </em>v. <em>Cariseo, </em>190 Conn. 141, 142-43, 459 A.2d 523 (1983).</p>\n<p id=\"b235-6\">The plaintiff claims that because the order provides for no reduction as each child reaches the age of majority, a portion of the support order will necessarily be attributable to the support of a child who has surpassed the age of majority. The plaintiff fails to acknowledge, however, the fact that he may move to modify the combined alimony and support order at any time, including the date on which each child reaches the age of majority.<footnotemark>5</footnotemark> This court has held that \u201c[w]hen, as part of a divorce decree, a parent is ordered to pay a specified amount periodically for the benefit of more than one child, the emancipation of one child does not automatically affect the liability of the parent for the full amount. . . . The proper remedy ... is to seek a modification of the decree.\u201d (Citation omitted; internal quotation marks omitted.) <em>Gillespie </em>v. <em>Gillespie, </em>8 Conn. App. 382, 386, 512 A.2d 238 (1986). Thus, although the attainment of majority by each child may not automatically entitle the plaintiff to a reduction in his alimony and support obligation, it provides a basis for the plaintiff to seek a modification. Because the order as framed by the court does not, by its own terms, require a payment of combined alimony and support beyond the dates on which the children reach the age of majority, and because the order is subject to modification as each <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"210\">*210</page-number>child reaches the age of majority, it is does not violate the proscription against orders for the payment of support beyond the permissible age.</p>\n<p id=\"b236-5\">Accordingly, we hold that the court\u2019s alimony and support order, which can be modified at any time by the court, does not, by its terms, require the plaintiff to pay postmajority child support. Therefore, it does not constitute an abuse of discretion by the court.</p>\n<p id=\"b236-6\">C</p>\n<p id=\"b236-7\">The plaintiff also claims that the court improperly awarded lifetime alimony. Specifically, the plaintiff claims that because the parties were married for less than ten years and they were both thirty-eight years old and in good health at the time of dissolution, the court abused its discretion in awarding alimony of indefinite duration. The record belies the plaintiffs claim.</p>\n<p id=\"b236-8\">General Statutes \u00a7 46b-82 (a) provides in relevant part: \u201cIn determining whether alimony shall be awarded, and the duration and amount of the award, the court shall hear the witnesses, if any, of each party, except as provided in subsection (a) of section 46b-51, shall consider the length of the marriage, the causes for the . . . dissolution of the marriage . . . the age, health, station, occupation, amount and sources of income, vocational skills, employability, estate and needs of each of the parties and the award, if any, which the court may make pursuant to section 46b-81 . . . .\u201d</p>\n<p id=\"b236-9\">\u201cGeneral Statutes \u00a7 46b-82 describes circumstances under which a court may award alimony. The court is to consider these factors in making an award of alimony, but it need not give each factor equal weight. ... As long as the trial court considers all of these statutory criteria, it may exercise broad discretion in awarding alimony.\u201d (Internal quotation marks omitted.) <em>Chyung </em>v. <em>Chyung, </em>86 Conn. App. 665, 669-70, 862 <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"211\">*211</page-number>A.2d 374 (2004), cert. denied, 273 Conn. 904, 868 A.2d 744 (2005).</p>\n<p id=\"b237-5\">In this case, the court found that the plaintiffs behavior, specifically his extramarital relationship, was the primary cause for the breakdown of the marriage. The court found that although both parties were in good health, the defendant has had no career other than as a homemaker, and that the plaintiffs occupation, vocational skills and employability afforded him greater prospects for income than were available to the defendant. The court also undertook a thorough examination of the assets of the parties. It is clear that the court was mindful of its obligation to consider the statutory factors in determining alimony. Given the court\u2019s finding, which was amply supported by the record, that the defendant had not been employed outside the home, had no prospects for employment and had no skills for employability, and the court\u2019s apparent consideration of the statutory factors, we cannot conclude that the court abused its discretion in issuing an alimony order of unlimited duration.</p>\n<p id=\"b237-6\">II</p>\n<p id=\"b237-7\">The plaintiff next claims that the court improperly awarded the defendant 50 percent of all of the plaintiffs stock options and restricted stock units.<footnotemark>6</footnotemark> Specifically, the plaintiff claims that the court should have distinguished between those awards he received for services performed during the marriage, those he received for employment services after the parties\u2019 separation and those he received in contemplation of future services. In making this claim, the plaintiff acknowledges, as he must, that the court has a broad latitude of discretion in formulating its orders regarding the distribution of <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"212\">*212</page-number>assets, including those that relate to employment. See <em>Bornemann </em>v. <em>Bornemann, </em>245 Conn. 508, 752 A.2d 978 (1998). To the extent that the plaintiff claims that the court did not fully explain its rationale for its orders, it is not the function of this court on review to engage in speculation. We note that neither party sought an articulation from the court regarding this portion of its orders. \u201cConclusions of the trial court cannot be reviewed where the appellant fails to establish through an adequate record that the trial court incorrectly applied the law or could not reasonably have concluded as it did . . . .\u201d (Internal quotation marks omitted.) <em>Calo-Turner </em>v. <em>Turner, </em>83 Conn. App. 53, 56, 847 A.2d 1085 (2004). Because the orders, as issued, are within the court\u2019s discretion, this claim fails.</p>\n<p id=\"b238-5\">Ill</p>\n<p id=\"b238-6\">The plaintiff next claims that the court improperly considered his bonus that was paid in early 2004 both as a source of income and as an asset to be distributed. This claim lacks merit.</p>\n<p id=\"b238-7\">As noted, the court ordered child support and alimony to be based on the plaintiffs cash earnings, including his cash bonuses. The court further ordered: \u201cThe plaintiff is awarded and shall retain his Chase Bank account listed as containing $326,979 . ...\u201d In January, 2004, the plaintiff received a bonus for his prior year\u2019s employment in the amount of $766,250 gross, and $456,992.78 net, which he claims he deposited into his Chase Bank account. The plaintiff claims that the court improperly based the support order on the bonus and awarded the bonus to the plaintiff as part of the division of assets. Merely because the plaintiff claims to have deposited the bonus into an account awarded to him as part of the property distribution does not indicate <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"213\">*213</page-number>that the court considered the bonus as both a source of income and an asset to be distributed.<footnotemark>7</footnotemark></p>\n<p id=\"b239-4\">IV</p>\n<p id=\"b239-5\">The plaintiff finally claims that the totality of the court\u2019s financial orders constituted an abuse of discretion. We disagree.</p>\n<p id=\"b239-6\">\u201cA fundamental principle in dissolution actions is that a trial court may exercise broad discretion in awarding alimony and dividing property as long as it considers all relevant statutory criteria. ... In reviewing the trial court\u2019s decision under [an abuse of discretion] standard, we are cognizant that [t]he issues involving financial orders are entirely interwoven. The rendering of judgment in a complicated dissolution case is a carefully crafted mosaic, each element of which may be dependent on the other.\u201d (Internal quotation marks omitted.) <em>Chyung </em>v. <em>Chyung, </em>supra, 86 Conn. App. 668.</p>\n<p id=\"b239-7\">The judgment is affirmed.</p>\n<p id=\"b239-8\">In this opinion HARPER, J., concurred.</p>\n<footnote label=\"1\">\n<p id=\"b228-8\"> To their credit, the parties stipulated to a parenting plan that was adopted by the court and incorporated into the decree of dissolution. The parties stipulated that they would share joint legal custody of the minor children, who would reside primarily with the defendant.</p>\n</footnote>\n<footnote label=\"2\">\n<p id=\"b232-6\"> The plaintiffs proposed orders provide, inter alia: \u201cThe Husband shall pay unallocated alimony and child support of 30 [percent] of his gross annual cash compensation from employment up to $1,000,000.00. The Husband\u2019s payment for unallocated alimony and child support shall be based in each year upon his gross earned cash compensation received for his prior year\u2019s performance, i.e., for calendar year 2004, he shall pay 30 percent of his base salary of $150,000. . . . \u2018Gross annual cash compensation from employment\u2019 shall only include base salary and cash bonuses received in any calendar year, but shall not include all forms of noncash compensation, such as stock options, restricted stock, [deferred profit sharing and employee stock ownership plans], Capital Accumulation Plan and other such incentive awards.\u201d</p>\n<p id=\"b232-7\">The defendant\u2019s proposed orders also suggest an unallocated support order based on the plaintiffs cash earnings. The stipulated pendente lite order for unallocated alimony and child support was also based on the plaintiffs base salary plus his cash bonus.</p>\n</footnote>\n<footnote label=\"3\">\n<p id=\"b234-8\"> Additional statutory provisions may apply, however, to modify this general rule. Pursuant to General Statutes \u00a7 46b-66 (a), a court in a dissolution proceeding may enter an order providing for postmajority child support when the parties have agreed in writing to the terms of that order. General Statutes \u00a7 46b-84 allows for postmajority support for children who are still in high school, and General Statutes \u00a7 46b-56c authorizes the court, at the time of the marital dissolution, to frame postmajority education orders.</p>\n</footnote>\n<footnote label=\"4\">\n<p id=\"b235-7\"> See General Statutes \u00a7 46b-84.</p>\n</footnote>\n<footnote label=\"5\">\n<p id=\"b235-8\"> \u201cGeneral Statutes \u00a7 46b-86 governs the modification or termination of an alimony or support order after the date of a dissolution judgment. . . .

App. 355, this court held that a trial court\u2019s repeated reference in its memorandum of decision to the parties\u2019 gross incomes, along with the failure to discuss the issue of net income, violated our well established precedent requiring that financial orders be based on net income, not gross income. Id., 358. As I will discuss in greater detail, it is my belief that the reasoning in <em>Ludgin </em>dictates a reversal of the court\u2019s financial order in this case. I believe that the majority\u2019s decision to discount our holding in <em>Ludgin </em>misinterprets our case law and will lead to confusion and instability in an area of law that is in need of clear and consistent guidelines.</p>\n<p id=\"b240-6\"><em>Ludgin </em>involved a dissolution action in which the parties sought alimony and child support orders from the court. Id., 356. Prior to the hearing, the parties had furnished the court with evidence of both their gross and net incomes. Id., 357, 358 n.2. In its memorandum of decision setting forth the financial orders, the court repeatedly referred to and compared the parties\u2019 gross incomes.<footnotemark>1</footnotemark> Id., 358. The plaintiff appealed to this court, <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"215\">*215</page-number>claiming that the trial court improperly had based its financial orders on the parties\u2019 gross incomes. Id., 356. This court, having reviewed the foregoing facts, concluded: \u201cAlthough the court had before it evidence of the parties\u2019 net incomes, it appears that the court chose not to rely on such information. The court\u2019s memorandum of decision is devoid of any mention of the parties\u2019 net incomes. The court relied solely on the parties\u2019 gross incomes in fashioning the financial orders. We conclude, therefore, that the court improperly designed its financial orders by relying on the parties\u2019 gross incomes rather than on their net incomes.\u201d Id., 358-59. The factual circumstances of the present case are comparable to those in <em>Ludgin </em>and, therefore, support a similar outcome.</p>\n<p id=\"b241-5\">As in <em>Ludgin, </em>the court in the present case, despite having before it evidence of net income, focused entirely on gross income throughout its memorandum of decision. The most compelling evidence that the court based its order on gross income is the terms of the financial order, which were expressed as a percentage of the plaintiffs gross income.* <footnotemark>2</footnotemark> I agree with the majority that a alimony and child support order expressed as a function of gross income <em>could, </em>in theory, still be based on net income. Nevertheless, that the court chose to express its order as a percentage of the plaintiffs gross income is significant and warrants closer scrutiny into the court\u2019s reasoning for basing the order on the gross, rather than the net, figures.</p>\n<p id=\"b241-6\">Here, however, it is not only the terms of the order but the totality of the court\u2019s reasoning throughout its memorandum of decision that leads me to conclude <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"216\">*216</page-number>that the award was based on gross income. Notably, the court\u2019s memorandum of decision also listed the plaintiffs gross earnings for the previous seven years. Specifically, the court stated: \u201cThe court lists the gross earnings of the plaintiff to illustrate the capability and ability he has displayed and the pay he has received for his efforts. Because his earned income fluctuates from year to year, the court will provide for a formula for the periodic alimony and child support. Each party has submitted a proposal in this respect in their proposed orders. The plaintiffs W-2 earnings for the previous seven years are as follows . . . [1997: $279,080; 1998: $373,073; 1999: $720,152; 2000: $368,937; 2001: $791,008; 2002: $564,038; 2003: $542,156].\u201d A comparison of the foregoing statement to the statements made by the court in <em>Ludgin; </em>see footnote 1 of this opinion; indicates that the courts\u2019 references to gross income in both cases are strikingly similar.</p>\n<p id=\"b242-5\">The majority reasons that the court made repeated reference to the plaintiffs gross income solely to demonstrate his ability to pay alimony and child support. I disagree. The better explanation, rather, for why the court focused on gross income is because the proposed orders submitted by both parties requested that the award be based on gross income. As the majority notes, the court expressly references the parties\u2019 proposed orders in its memorandum of decision. See footnote 2 of the majority opinion. That the parties requested that the order be based on gross income and that the court responded with an award expressed as a function of gross income strongly indicates that the court based its award on gross income. Regardless of whether the parties requested such a result in their proposed orders, however, the court cannot circumvent our well established precedent requiring that financial orders be based on net income. See <em>Morris </em>v. <em>Morris, </em>supra, 262 Conn. 306.</p>\n<p id=\"b243-4\"><page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"217\">*217</page-number>Further, nowhere in its memorandum of decision did the court indicate that it relied on net income as a basis for the order.<footnotemark>3</footnotemark> The majority correctly points out that, generally speaking, a court is not required to make an explicit finding regarding net income in its memorandum of decision. See <em>Dombrowski </em>v. <em>Noyes-Dombrowski, </em>273 Conn. 127, 137, 869 A.2d 164 (2005). In relying on this principle to affirm the court\u2019s order, however, the majority presumes too much. The majority refers to the trial court\u2019s references to the plaintiffs financial affidavit, his tax returns and the net value of his most recent cash bonus, and concludes that the court had ample evidence from which it could determine the parties\u2019 net incomes. Simply because the court had before it evidence of net income, however, does not necessarily mean that the court relied on net income. See <em>Ludgin </em>v. McGowan, supra, 64 Conn. App. 358.<footnotemark>4</footnotemark> What we are presented with in this case is not a situation in which the court merely failed to detail its reasoning with regard to the net income of the parties. In this case, not only is any meaningful mention of net income absent from the memorandum of decision,<footnotemark>5</footnotemark> but also in its place is a detailed analysis of <em>gross </em>income. In my opinion, given the court\u2019s emphasis on gross income, the court would have had to make it clear that it had <em>not </em>based its decision on gross income. Without any such indication, I cannot see how the court\u2019s order can be sustained.</p>\n<p id=\"b244-4\"><page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"218\">*218</page-number>The majority\u2019s attempt to distinguish <em>Ludgin </em>from other relevant case law is not persuasive. <em>Morris </em>v. <em>Morris, </em>supra, 262 Conn. 299, is the most recent Supreme Court case on point and the only Supreme Court case decided after our holding in <em>Ludgin. In Morris, </em>our Supreme Court concluded that the trial court had abused its discretion in fashioning a support order because in its memorandum of decision, it \u201caffirmatively and expressly stated that it relied on gross incomes in determining support . . . .\u201d<footnotemark>6</footnotemark> Id., 307. The court\u2019s holding reinforces our well established case law dictating that financial orders be based on net income, not gross income. Yet, as the majority concedes, <em>Morris </em>cannot be read so narrowly as to invalidate orders only when a court states in <em>explicit </em>terms that it relied on gross income. In fact, the majority can cite nothing about <em>Morris </em>that alters the controlling weight of <em>Ludgin. </em>Because the facts of the present case more closely resemble the facts of <em>Ludgin </em>than the facts of <em>Morris, Ludgin </em>is more helpful than <em>Morris </em>in the analysis.</p>\n<p id=\"b244-5\">In further support of its decision to sustain the order, the majority relies on <em>Kelman </em>v. <em>Kelman, </em>86 Conn. App. 120, 860 A.2d 292 (2004), cert. denied, 273 Conn. 911, 870 A.2d 1079 (2005). In <em>Kelman, </em>we determined that a trial court, despite having referenced the parties\u2019 gross incomes in its memorandum of decision, did not abuse its discretion in fashioning its financial orders. Id., 124. There is a critical distinction between <em>Kelman </em>and the present case, however. In <em>Kelman, </em>the court <em>expressly stated </em>that it had based its orders on all of the relevant information, including the parties\u2019 financial affidavits and child support guideline worksheets, both of which included the parties\u2019 net incomes. Id., 123. The presence <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"219\">*219</page-number>of this language in the memorandum of decision is what saved the financial orders. In the present case, that language, or anything equivalent, is wholly absent from the court\u2019s memorandum of decision. The court in the present case never stated that it had relied on net income, nor did it make a more general statement indicating that it had relied on documents containing information of the parties\u2019 net incomes. Because the court in <em>Kelman </em>provided the reviewing court with some evidence that it had based its order on the proper criteria,<footnotemark>7</footnotemark> <em>Kelman </em>cannot be used to support the majority\u2019s decision to affirm the decision in this case, in which no such evidence was provided.</p>\n<p id=\"b245-4\">The law is clear and simple: financial orders may not be based on gross income. When all evidence indicates that an award has been based on gross income, a trial court cannot be entitled to a presumption otherwise. I respectfully dissent from part I of the majority\u2019s opinion and, consequently, would not reach the other claims presented on appeal. I would reverse the judgment as to the financial orders and remand the case for a new hearing in accordance with law.</p>\n<footnote label=\"1\">\n<p id=\"b240-7\"> For example, the court stated in its memorandum of decision that \u201c[t]he plaintiffs financial affidavit is not reflective of a regular weekly salary, but rather a computation of . . . gross income. The plaintiff testified that his . . . gross income for the year 1996 was $64,132 ... for the year 1997 [it was] $65,455 . . . .\u201d (Internal quotation marks omitted.) <em>Ludgin </em>v. <em>McGo</em><page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"215\">*215</page-number><em>wan, </em>supra, 64 Conn.
