In their returns respondents have denied that any such preference based on ballot position exists.</p>\n<p id=\"b717-10\">The existence of the alleged preference is not a fact which is either of such common knowledge or which is subject to such accurate determination by resort to sources of reasonably indisputable accuracy that it is not reasonably subject to dispute. Accordingly it is not a fact properly the subject of judicial notice. (Evid. Code, \u00a7 452, subds. (g) and (h).)</p>\n<p id=\"b717-11\">It therefore appears that we are confronted with a disputed question of fact the resolution of which may more appropriately be undertaken in the superior court. <em>(Roma Macaroni Factory </em>v. <em>Giambastiani, </em>219 Cal. 435, 437 [27 P.2d 371].)</p>\n<p id=\"b717-12\">For the foregoing reasons the alternative writ of mandate heretofore issued is discharged and the petition for writ of mandate is denied without <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"738\">*738</page-number>prejudice to any subsequent proceedings which may be initiated in the superior court.</p>\n</opinion>\n<opinion data-order=\"10\" data-type=\"opinion\" id=\"x999-2\" type=\"dissent\">\n<author id=\"b718-4\">TOBRINER, J.</author>\n<p id=\"Ajx\">I dissent for the reasons stated in my dissenting opinion in <em>Mexican-American Political Association </em>v. <em>Brown </em>(Sac. 7951) <em>ante, </em>page 733 [106 Cal.Rptr. 12, 505 P.2d 204].</p>\n<p id=\"b718-5\">Petitioner\u2019s application for a rehearing was denied March 8, 1973.
