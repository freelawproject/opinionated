Both at the preliminary hearing and at trial, Goliday\u2019s counsel sought information which would help him locate two informer-eyewitnesses to the alleged sale who were neither paid nor regular agents of the police. The prosecution provided only the first names of the informers. For the reasons set forth below, we reverse the convictions for sale of restricted drugs under Health and Safety Code section 11912, and affirm the convictions for the two counts of possession for sale under Health and Safety Code section 11911. We hold that when a person who' actively cooperates with the police becomes an eyewitness to a narcotics violation the police and prosecution must \u201cundertake <em>reasonable efforts </em>in good faith to <em>locate </em>the informer so that either party or the court itself . . . could, if it so desired, subpena him as a witness.\u201d <em>(Eleazer </em>v. <em>Superior Court, supra, </em>1 Cal.3d at p. 853.)</p>\n<p id=\"b755-3\"><page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"775\">*775</page-number>I. <em>The Facts</em></p>\n<p id=\"b755-4\">We first review the facts and testimony presented to the superior court. On July 19, 1970, Officer Nettles of the Los Angeles Police Department Narcotics Division received a telephone call from a female, identified only as \u201cFrankie,\u201d who volunteered information concerning a narcotics dealer. The next day Officer Nettles, dressed in civilian clothes, met \u201cFrankie\u201d and a companion named \u201cSue\u201d; this trio proceeded to the defendant\u2019s apartment for the purpose of purchasing restricted drugs; they were admitted inside while other officers waited undercover nearby. Five persons, including the defendant Goliday, were present in the apartment in addition to the two informers and Officer Nettles.<footnotemark>1</footnotemark></p>\n<p id=\"b755-5\">What happened next became an issue critical to the charges of sale and possession for sale of narcotics. The prosecution offered only the testimony of Officer Nettles; he testified that defendant Goliday removed a paper sack from a hall closet, counted out 37 amphetamine and secobarbital capsules, handed them to Officer Nettles, and accepted $10 in payment. Officer Nettles, \u201cFrankie,\u201d and \u201cSue\" then left defendant\u2019s apartment.</p>\n<p id=\"b755-6\">Five minutes later Officer Johnson and other officers announced their presence, entered the apartment, and arrested the defendant. According to Officer Johnson\u2019s testimony, the police discovered several caches inside the apartment containing some 800 narcotics tablets.</p>\n<p id=\"b755-7\">Goliday pled not guilty, and, at the preliminary hearing on October 8, 1970, his defense counsel asked Officer Nettles on cross-examination how counsel could contact \u201cFrankie\u201d and \u201cSue\u201d for possible use as defense witnesses. Officer Nettles replied, \u201cI don\u2019t know.\u201d He testified that he did not know the last name of either of the two informers, that the police possessed no other information about the informers, and that he deliberately refrained from obtaining such information to prevent \u201cFrankie\u201d and \u201cSue\u201d from being called as witnesses.<footnotemark>2</footnotemark> He also testified that to his knowledge <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"776\">*776</page-number>no other contacts occurred between the police and the informants before or after the incidents described above, and that neither \u201cFrankie\u201d nor \u201cSue\u201d received compensation.</p>\n<p id=\"b756-4\">Five months later, at the trial on March 4, 1971, additional information concerning the informers came to light. After the trial judge ordered disclosure of \u201call information that the police have concerning anyone who may be a witness,\u201d the prosecution revealed that Officer Nettles had \u201cdiscovered\u201d a telephone number supplied by one of the two informers. According to Officer Nettles he found that when he dialed the number two weeks before the trial, the phone had been disconnected; he was unable to recall the date on which he obtained the number even though he earlier testified that the only police contact with \u201cSue\u201d and \u201cFrankie\u201d occurred on July 19 and July 20, 1970.</p>\n<p id=\"b756-5\">Goliday\u2019s counsel then moved for dismissal, claiming that the prosecution\u2019s failure to supply information which might enable the defense to contact material witness informants had denied him due process of law.* I*<footnotemark>3</footnotemark> The trial judge held that <em>Eleazer </em>v. <em>Superior Court, supra, </em>1 Cal.3d 847, does not require the police to undertake reasonable efforts to obtain information about material witnesses who are neither regular nor paid informants.</p>\n<p id=\"b757-3\"><page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"777\">*777</page-number>II. <em>The convictions under Health and Safety Code section 11912 must be reversed because the prosecution and police failed in their duty both to obtain and to disclose information by which eyewitness informants could be located.</em></p>\n<p id=\"b757-4\">We first consider the defendant\u2019s convictions under Health and Safety Code section 11912 for two counts of sale of restricted drugs.</p>\n<p id=\"b757-5\">The common law informer\u2019s privilege<footnotemark>4</footnotemark>\u2014the privilege against disclosure of the identity of persons who supply the government with information concerning the commission of crimes\u2014now lies embedded in Evidence Code section 1041.<footnotemark>5</footnotemark> As we said in <em>People </em>v. <em>Garcia </em>(1967) 67 Cal.2d 830 [64 Cal.Rptr. 110, 434 P.2d 366], however, \u201cthe official identity-of-informant privilege must yield when it is shown that the informant whose identity is sought is a material witness for the defense and nondisclosure <em>would deprive the defendant of a fair trial. </em>In such cases, it is clear that the \u2018balance\u2019 is struck in favor of the defendant, and disclosure must be ordered upon pain of dismissal. . . . [6&gt;]n7y after it [is] first determined that the informant \u2018is not a material witness to the guilt or innocence of the accused\u2019 \u201d can disclosure be denied. (Italics in the original.) (67 Cal.2d <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"778\">*778</page-number>at pp. 842-843; <em>Honore </em>v. <em>Superior Court </em>(1969) 70 Cal.2d 162 [74 Cal.Rptr. 233, 449 P.2d 169].)<footnotemark>6</footnotemark></p>\n<p id=\"b758-4\">Although originally this duty to disclose the identity of a material witness required only that the prosecution reveal information actually in its possession, in <em>Eleazer </em>v. <em>Superior Court, supra, </em>1 Cal.3d 847, we extended the prosecution\u2019s obligation and required, in addition, reasonable steps <em>to locate or obtain </em>information about such informants. If \u201cthrough police tactics or happenstance [an] informer becomes a material witness, the police should make such inquiries and arrangements as are reasonably necessary to enable the prosecution and defense to locate him.\u201d (1 Cal.3d at pi 852.) We recognized the futility of a rule requiring disclosure of the information which the police know about a material witness informer without a further requirement that the police make efforts to obtain information useful in locating the informer as well. We noted, however, that \u201c[d]ue process requires only that the police and the district attorney undertake <em>reasonable efforts </em>in good faith to <em>locate </em>the informer so that either party or the court itself (see Evid. Code, \u00a7 775) could, if it so desired, subpena him as a witness.\u201d (Italics in the original.) (1 Cal.3d at p. 853.)</p>\n<p id=\"b758-5\">A.  <em>The police and prosecution failed to undertake reasonable efforts to obtain information by which the defense could locate the two eyewitnesses.</em></p>\n<p id=\"b758-6\">Applying the principles set forth above to the instant case, we note that both \u201cFrankie\u201d and \u201cSue\u201d were clearly \u201cmaterial witnesses on the issue of guilt\u201d since they were eyewitness participants to the alleged sale. <em>(People </em>v. <em>Garcia, supra, </em>67 Cal.2d at p. 837; <em>People </em>v. <em>Durazo </em>(1959) 52 Cal.2d 354, 356 [340 P.2d 594, 76 A.L.R.2d 257]; <em>People </em>v. <em>Williams </em>(1958) 51 Cal.2d 355, 359 [333 P.2d 19].)  We need not speculate about what \u201cFrankie\u201d and \u201cSue\u201d might have revealed as witnesses; an accused need show only a possibility that a material witness might testify favorably on his behalf; a defendant \u201cneed not prove conclusively before disclosure the very fact [he] seek[s] to obtain through disclosure.\u201d <em>(People </em>v. <em>Perez </em>(1965) 62 Cal.2d 769, 773-774 [44 Cal.Rptr. 326, 401 P.2d 934]; <em>Price </em>v. <em>Superior Court </em>(1970) 1 Cal.3d 836, 843 [83 Cal.Rptr. 369, 463 P.2d 721].) Here, for example, the two informers might have supported the defendant\u2019s plea of innocence to the sale counts by testifying that the de<page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"779\">*779</page-number>fendant declined to sell restricted drugs to Officer Nettles. The prosecution, therefore, owed a duty to disclose the \u201cidentity\u201d of the two eyewitness informers at the preliminary hearing as well as at trial. <em>(Mitchell </em>v. <em>Superior Court </em>(1958) 50 Cal.2d 827, 829 [330 P.2d 48].)</p>\n<p id=\"b759-4\">The prosecution in the present case conceded its duty to give to the defense all the information that it had about the informants; the question presented to us turns on whether the prosecution can avoid the <em>additional </em>duty to obtain information, which we announced in <em>Eleazer </em>v. <em>Superior Court, supra, </em>1 Cal.3d 847. The Attorney General contends that the <em>Eleazer </em>rule applies only in cases involving a regular or compensated police informant. He emphasizes the following statement taken from a footnote of our <em>Eleazer </em>opinion: \u201cIn imposing a duty to undertake reasonable efforts to locate an informer we mean by an \u2018informer\u2019 a person who regularly supplies information to the law enforcement agency, or who is compensated for the furnishing of information.\u201d <em>(Eleazer </em>v. <em>Superior Court, supra, </em>1 Cal.3d at p. 853, fn. 10.)</p>\n<p id=\"b759-5\">This language, the Attorney General contends, controls the instant case since \u201cFrankie\u201d and \u201cSue,\u201d according to the testimony before the superior court, supplied information on one occasion only and received no payment from the police. We set forth below the reasons why we have concluded that the footnote is not controlling.</p>\n<p id=\"b759-6\">In the first place, the Attorney General places an unwarranted emphasis on dictum. <em>Eleazer, </em>of course, involved a paid informer who participated in some 20 narcotics purchases while working with a police undercover agent. The <em>Eleazer </em>footnote on which the Attorney General relies merely reflected the factual setting and actual holding of that case; we did not foreclose consideration of the duty of the police and prosecution in other situations, and to the extent that the footnote can be interpreted otherwise, we disapprove it here.</p>\n<p id=\"b759-7\">Second, it is often difficult, if not impossible to know whether an informer provides information \u201cregularly.\u201d <em>People </em>v. <em>Fortier </em>(1970) 10 Cal.App.3d 760 [89 Cal.Rptr. 210], illustrates the problem. There the defense sought disclosure of the identity of a female informer who accompanied two undercover police officers on an alleged narcotics \u201cbuy\u201d; the prosecution could supply no useful information about the informer since the officers knew only her first name. The prosecution contended that the <em>Eleazer </em>duty to undertake \u201creasonable\u201d efforts to acquire additional information did not apply since one of the undercover officers testified that <em>\u201che </em>met the [informer] on this one occasion, only, and [that] <em>he </em>did not pay her anything.\u201d (Italics added.) (10 Cal.App.3d p. 767.) The Court of Appeal rejected <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"780\">*780</page-number>this contention noting that the \u201ctestimony [was] of little value in showing whether [the informer] was regularly supplying information . . . for compensation\u201d to other policemen. (10 Cal.App.3d at p. 767.) Although holding <em>Eleazer </em>inapplicable because that decision has not been given retroactive effect,<footnotemark>7</footnotemark> the <em>Fortier </em>court declared that, otherwise, <em>Eleazer </em>would have applied since the police officer\u2019s testimony failed to prove that the informer was neither a paid nor regular agent of the police.</p>\n<p id=\"b760-4\">The Attorney General seeks to distinguish <em>People </em>v. <em>Fortier </em>by arguing that in the instant case the question whether <em>other </em>police officers, in. addition to Officer Nettles, received information from \u201cFrankie\u201d or \u201cSue\u201d \u201cwas explored at length\u201d at trial. This argument lacks confirmation in the record. Officer Nettles testified that <em>to his knowledge </em>neither \u201cFrankie\u201d nor \u201cSue\u201d worked with the police before or after the incidents leading to Goliday\u2019s arrest. On cross-examination Officer Nettles reported that he checked with \u201cseveral,\u201d <em>but not all, </em>of his fellow officers in the narcotics division; he further testified that he made no inquiry concerning \u201cFrankie\u201d or \u201cSue\u201d to officers in other divisions. On this ambiguous record we cannot say that the prosecution adequately fulfilled its duty to probe the relationship between the police and the eyewitness informers. As in <em>People </em>v. <em>Fortier, </em>\u201cthe testimony is of little value in showing whether or not [the informers were] regularly supplying information to the police department.\u201d (10 Cal.App.3d at p. 767.)</p>\n<p id=\"b760-5\">The impossibility, from a practical standpoint, of determining whether an informer received \u201ccompensation\u201d is further demonstrated by the testimony in this case. Officer Nettles testified that \u201cFrankie\u201d and \u201cSue\u201d were not \u201ccompensated\u201d <em>by him. </em>He could not speak for other officers. Nor can we assume that Officer Nettles understood the technical meaning given the word \u201ccompensation\u201d by the courts. <em>\u201cCompensation may be cash . . </em>. <em>but may also consist of promises of immunity or of lessened charges or punishment.\u201d </em>(Italics added.) <em>(Eleazer </em>v. <em>Superior Court, supra, 1 </em>Cal.3d at p. 853, fn. 10.)</p>\n<p id=\"b760-6\">Since \u201cFrankie\u201d and \u201cSue\u201d acted under the \u201cimmediate supervision\u201d of Police Officer Nettles, they enjoyed a statutory immunity from prosecution for their part in arranging the particular sale of narcotics involved here. (Health &amp; Saf. Code, \u00a7 11710.) The police, however, frequently make additional promises to informers such as immunity from arrest for unre<page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"781\">*781</page-number>lated violations of the narcotics laws (see, e.g., <em>People </em>v. <em>Cheatham </em>(1971) 21 Cal.App.3d 675, 677, fn. 2 [98 Cal.Rptr. 670]), and the record before us fails to reveal whether such guarantees of immunity or other \u201cfavors\u201d occurred here. Indeed, without a comprehensive perusal of all police records and the systematic questioning of other police officers and other police departments in every case, we could never be assured that an informer was not a \u201cregular\u201d or \u201ccompensated\u201d police agent.</p>\n<p id=\"b761-4\">Third, and most importantly, the policies underlying our decision in <em>Eleazer, </em>and the long line of cases preceding it, dictate that the police should undertake reasonable efforts to obtain information about all material witness informants who served as active agents of the police. As we have seen, fairness to the accused outweighs the informer\u2019s interests in anonymity if and when he becomes a material witness on the issue of guilt. In <em>Eleazer, </em>we recognized the futility of a rule requiring disclosure of the information that the police have about a material witness without a further requirement that the police make reasonable efforts to <em>obtain </em>useful information as well. A defendant\u2019s right to a fair trial deserves no less respect where \u201cthe police . . . make no effort to learn the residence of the informer or to establish a way by which to locate him.\u201d (1 Cal.3d at p. 852.)</p>\n<p id=\"b761-5\">The soundness of this controlling principle of <em>Eleazer </em>finds graphic illustration in the instant case. Here, the police themselves made two informants into eyewitness-participants in a narcotics transaction; the police then <em>deliberately </em>failed to obtain the last names and addresses of these informants in order to prevent them from being subpoenaed as defense witnesses. \u201cThat the police did so without motive to harm the defendant, but to foster the security of the informer, does not afford a sufficient justification . . . [for] \u2018depriving the defendant of a fair trial.\u2019 \u201d <em>(Eleazer </em>v. <em>Superior Court, supra, </em>1 Cal.3d at p. 852; see also <em>People </em>v. <em>Kiihoa </em>(1960) 53 Cal.2d 748, 754 [3 Cal.Rptr. 1, 349 P.2d 673].)  We do not, however, rely on the <em>subjective </em>intent of the police; the defendant is denied a fair trial whenever the police fail to undertake reasonable efforts to obtain information useful for locating a material witness informer who served as an active agent of the police.</p>\n<p id=\"b761-7\">Nor does the happenstance that the informers were neither paid nor regular agents of the police provide a justification for the failure to undertake efforts to obtain such information.  \u201cThe fact that [an informer] does not regularly provide information and is not paid should, if anything, make his testimony more credible and, hence, of more potential value to both prosecution and defense.\u201d (Louisell and Wally, Modern Cal. Discovery (2d ed. 1972) p. 877.)</p>\n<p id=\"b762-3\"><page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"782\">*782</page-number>We emphasize that the eyewitness informers involved here acted as police agents at the time of the alleged sale.  The police bear no duty to obtain information about a person who is not a material witness, who \u201csimply points the finger of suspicion toward a person who has violated the law. He puts the wheels in motion which cause the defendant to be suspected and perhaps arrested, but he plays no part in the criminal act with which the defendant is charged.\u201d <em>(People </em>v. <em>Lawrence </em>(1957) 149 Cal.App.2d 435, 450 [308 P.2d 821].) If, however, a material witness serves as an agent of the police and becomes a material witness on the issue of guilt, his desire for anonymity must yield to the interest of the accused in a fair trial. The police, accordingly, must undertake reasonable efforts to obtain information by which the defense may locate such an informer. They did not do so here.</p>\n<p id=\"b762-4\">B. <em>The police and prosecution also failed in their duty to disclose all the information about the two eyewitness informants which was actually in the possession of the police. \u25a0</em></p>\n<p id=\"b762-5\">The failure of the police to disclose, in timely fashion, the telephone number supplied by one of the infonners provides an additional, and independent, ground for reversing the conviction for sale of narcotics. Since \u201cFrankie\u201d and \u201cSue\u201d were material witnesses on the issue of guilt, disclosure was required, upon request, at the preliminary hearing. <em>(Mitchell </em>v. <em>Superior Court </em>(1958) 50 Cal.2d 827, 829 [330 P.2d 48].) \u201cWhat must be disclosed is the witness\u2019s \u2018identity\u2019; not merely his name, but all pertinent information which might assist the defense to locate him.\u201d <em>(Eleazer </em>v. <em>Superior Court, supra, </em>1 Cal.3d at p. 851; <em>People </em>v. <em>Diaz </em>(1959) 174 Cal.App.2d 799, 802 [345 P.2d 370].)</p>\n<p id=\"b762-6\">Here, one of the informants admittedly gave the police a \u201ccontact\u201d telephone number; at the preliminary hearing the prosecution told defense counsel that it knew of no method of locating either informant; the prosecution disclosed the telephone number only on March 4, 1971\u2014some five months after the preliminary hearing. Although the officers could not remember when they obtained this number, we cannot assume that they obtained it after July 19 or July 20, 1970, since the police witnesses testified that their only contacts with \u201cFrankie\u201d and \u201cSue\u201d occurred on those dates.<footnotemark>8</footnotemark></p>\n<p id=\"b763-3\"><page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"783\">*783</page-number>We do not intimate that the failure to disclose the \u201ccontact\u201d telephone number at the preliminary hearing occurred for reasons other than inadvertence; \u201cmotives and purposes cannot prevail when, as here, they inevitably result, intentionally or unintentionally, in depriving the defendant of a fair trial.\u201d <em>(People </em>v. <em>Kiihoa, supra, </em>53 Cal.2d at p. 754.) Nor was the failure to disclose the telephone number rendered harmless by the belated discovery, only two weeks before trial, that the number had been disconnected; disclosure at the preliminary hearing months earlier might well have enabled defense counsel to contact \u201cFrankie\u201d or \u201cSue\u201d before their departure.</p>\n<p id=\"b763-4\">III.  <em>The conviction for two counts of violating Health and Safety Code section 11911 should not be reversed since the undisclosed informants were not material witnesses on the issue of possession for sale.</em></p>\n<p id=\"b763-5\">Although we have held that the convictions for sale of narcotics should be reversed, we find no basis for reversal of the counts relating to possession for sale. Our decision in <em>People </em>v. <em>Garcia, supra, </em>67 Cal.2d 830, requires reversal only upon a failure to disclose an informer who is a material witness on the issue of guilt.  The only elements necessary to establish a violation of Health and Safety Code section 11911 are possession of a restricted drug and a purpose to sell it. <em>(People </em>v. <em>Hunt </em>(1971) 4 Cal.3d 231, 236 [93 Cal.Rptr. 197, 481 P.2d 205]; <em>People </em>v. <em>Allen </em>(1967) 254 Cal.App.2d 597, 600-601, 602 [62 Cal.Rptr. 235].) The record before us establishes both of these elements without reference to anything that the informers might have witnessed while accompanying Officer Nettles during the purported sale.</p>\n<p id=\"b763-6\">Turning first, to the element of possession, we note that the defendant clearly exercised \u201cdominion and control\u201d over the caches of narcotic capsules found in his apartment. No suggestion appears in the record that \u201cFrankie\u201d or \u201cSue\u201d could have \u201cplanted\u201d the several caches scattered throughout the apartment,<footnotemark>9</footnotemark> and the defense offered no other explanation for the presence of the narcotics.</p>\n<p id=\"b763-7\">As to the element of purpose necessary to support a conviction for possession for sale, the large quantity of narcotics found in the defend<page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"784\">*784</page-number>ant\u2019s apartment raised an inference that defendant intended to sell them.<footnotemark>10</footnotemark> The police discovered some 800 capsules of restricted drugs hidden in various places in the apartment, and Officer Johnson testified that, based on this large number of capsules, he concluded that the defendant held them for sale. If the inference that the defendant possessed the drugs for sale had rested solely on the alleged narcotics transaction with Officer Nettles, the defendant\u2019s access to the eyewitness informers might have been crucial to his defense. We face; however, a different case. Here the large quantity of narcotics properly supports an inference that the defendant intended to sell them <em>(People </em>v. <em>Allen </em>(1967) 254 Cal.App.2d 597, 603 [62 Cal.Rptr. 235]).

Although Officer Johnson testified that \u201cSue\u201d told him she was Goliday\u2019s ex-common law wife, Goliday later testified that he knew \u201cSue\" only casually as a customer at a service station where he worked, that he never dated her, and that he knew neither her last name nor how to contact her; Goliday further testified that he possessed no knowledge whatever about the girl called \u201cFrankie.\u201d Although Goliday\u2019s testimony conflicts with the foregoing hearsay testimony of Officer Johnson, the trial judge declined to find that Goliday knew how to contact the two informers. Instead, he assumed that Goliday had no such information, and ruled that, even so, the police owed no duty to make reasonable efforts to acquire information about the two girls since they were neither paid nor regular informers.</p>\n</footnote>\n<footnote label=\"4\">\n<p id=\"b757-6\"> 8 Wigmore, Evidence (McNaughton Rev. 1961) section 2374, page 761; see also Note, 76 A.L.R.2d 267; Note (1960) 33 So.Cal.L.Rev. 344.</p>\n</footnote>\n<footnote label=\"5\">\n<p id=\"b757-7\">Evidence Code section 1041 provides in full: \u201c(a) Except as provided in this section, a public entity has a privilege to refuse to disclose the identity of a person who has furnished information as provided in subdivision (b) purporting to disclose a violation of a law of the United States or of this state or a public entity in this state, and to prevent another from disclosing such identity, if the privilege is claimed by a person authorized by the public entity to do so and: ,</p>\n<blockquote id=\"b757-8\">\u201c(1) Disclosure is forbidden by an act of the Congress of the United States or a statute of this state; or</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b757-9\">\u201c(2) Disclosure of the identity of the informer is against the public interest because there is a necessity for preserving the confidentiality of his identity that outweighs the necessity for disclosure in the interest of justice; but no privilege may be claimed under this paragraph if any person authorized to do so has consented that the identity of the informer be disclosed in the proceeding.
