Code, \u00a7 288a.)<footnotemark>1</footnotemark> The sole witness at the preliminary hearing was the arresting officer, who testified as to his observations of defendant from a clandestine vantage point. Defendant made timely objection to the admissibility of the officer\u2019s testimony. Following denial of his motion to dismiss the information (\u00a7 995) defendant waived jury trial and agreed to the submission of the case on the evidence appearing in the transcript of the preliminary hearing.<footnotemark>2</footnotemark> De<page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"888\">*888</page-number>fendant was found guilty and was placed on probation. Among the conditions prescribed in the order granting probation were that defendant serve 30 days in the county jail and pay a fine of $300. He was released on his own recognizance (\u00a7 1318) pending disposition of his appeal.</p>\n<p id=\"b868-4\">Defendant\u2019s sole allegation of error on appeal is the failure to suppress the arresting officer\u2019s testimony, which he contends was the intangible fruit of an illegal search and hence was admitted into evidence in violation of his rights under the United States Constitution (4th and 14th Amends.) and the California Constitution (art. I, \u00a7 19). We conclude that the evidence used to convict defendant must be suppressed.</p>\n<p id=\"b868-5\">On the afternoon of December 19, 1970, Los Angeles Police Officer Richard Aldahl was-on plainclothes patrol in Arroyo Seco Park in the City of Los Angeles. Accompanying Officer Aldahl were two fellow plain-clothed officers. Officer Aldahl observed defendant enter the men\u2019s room in the park. About 10 minutes later, David Crockett was observed entering the same men\u2019s room. Defendant had not yet reappeared. About five minutes after Crockett\u2019s entrance into the men\u2019s room, the three officers entered the \u201cplumbing access area\u2019\u2019 of the park\u2019s restroom building.* *<footnotemark>3</footnotemark> From a vantage point connected with this area Officer Aldahl was able to observe defendant orally copulating Crockett, while both Crockett and defendant were within a doorless toilet stall.<footnotemark>4</footnotemark></p>\n<p id=\"b868-6\">Officer Aldahl testified at the preliminary hearing that he had entered <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"889\">*889</page-number>the plumbing access area at the park about 50 times for the purpose of ascertaining if any criminal conduct was Occurring in the adjacent men\u2019s room. Other than entering the restroom at a 10-minute interval, a circumstance the officer had seen many times before in an innocent context, neither defendant nor Crockett had committed any suspicious acts. Officer Aldahl agreed with defense counsel that he had entered the plumbing access area on this occasion \u201cto make an observation in case there was a crime committed.\u201d</p>\n<p id=\"b869-5\">This court last considered the legality of clandestine restroom observations by policemen in <em>Bielicki </em>v. <em>Superior Court </em>(1962) 57 Cal.2d 602 [21 Cal.Rptr. 552, 371 P.2d 288] and <em>Britt </em>v. <em>Superior Court </em>(1962) 58 Cal.2d 469 [24 Cal.Rptr. 849, 374 P.2d 817]. In <em>Bielicki, </em>a policeman used a pipe running through the ceiling to the roof to observe homosexual conduct inside the fully-enclosed stall of a pay toilet in an amusement park restroom. The pipe had been installed purely for observational purposes in response to the park owner\u2019s complaint to the vice squad. The policeman\u2019s observation in <em>Bielicki </em>was held by a unanimous court to be a search. We held that such constituted a search because only by means of the clandestine vantage point had the policeman \u201csecretly observed activities of petitioners which no member of the public could have seen, as they were carried on within the confines of toilet booths each enclosed by three walls and a door.\u201d It was \u201cundisputed that the activities of petitioners witnessed by [the arresting officer] were not \u2018in plain sight\u2019 or \u2018readily visible and accessible\u2019 . ...\u201d (57 Cal.2d at p. 607.) We further held that the search was unreasonable because the officer had begun his observations on the night in question with \u201cno reasonable cause to arrest these petitioners. . . . [H]e spied on innocent and guilty alike. Such a practice amounts to a general exploratory search conducted solely to find evidence of guilt, a practice condemned both by federal law [citatons omitted] and by the law of this state [citations omitted].\u201d (57 Cal.2d at pp. 605-606.)</p>\n<p id=\"b869-6\">Lest <em>Bielicki </em>receive too restrictive a reading this court, again acting unanimously, decided <em>Britt </em>five months after <em>Bielicki. </em>The facts in <em>Britt </em>were substantially identical to those presented in the case at bench. The arresting officer had been stationed in the space between the ceiling of a department store restroom and the floor above. He was able to look down through two vents in the ceiling upon the toilet stalls in the men\u2019s room below. Each stall was enclosed by partitions and a door, but the enclosures stopped 8 to 12 inches from the floor. The arresting officer observed from his position an act of oral copulation by Britt and his codefendant who <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"890\">*890</page-number>occupied adjacent stalls and committed the crime from kneeling positions through the gap between the partitions and the floor.</p>\n<p id=\"b870-4\">The People attempted to distinguish <em>Britt </em>from <em>Bielicki </em>on three points: first, the vents in <em>Britt </em>through which the officer peered had originally been installed for a legitimate purpose; second, the toilets in <em>Britt </em>were free rather than pay toilets; and third, the activities observed in <em>Britt </em>were in \u201cplain view\u201d because of the gap between the partitions and the floor. These arguments were rejected: \u201cThe crucial fact in <em>Bielicki </em>was neither the manner of observation <em>alone </em>nor the place of commission <em>alone, </em>but rather the manner in which the police observed a place\u2014and persons in that place\u2014which is ordinarily understood to afford personal privacy to individual occupants.\u201d (58 Cal.2d at p. 472.)</p>\n<p id=\"b870-5\">Because the decisions in <em>Bielicki </em>and <em>Britt </em>were justified in part as protecting \u201cexpectations of privacy,\u201d several subsequent appellate decisions have treated the presence or absence of a door to a toilet stall in which criminal conduct occurs as determinative of the legality of clandestine observation of that stall. Under such a concept of the law, it was reasoned that there is a presumption that conduct which <em>could </em>have been viewed by an officer from a place where the public had a right to be <em>could not </em>reasonably have been expected to be private. Language to the contrary in <em>Britt </em>which placed as much emphasis on the <em>means of observation </em>as on the place observed has been disregarded and <em>Bielicki </em>has been limited to its facts in this line of cases. <em>(People </em>v. <em>Crafts </em>(1970) 13 Cal.App.3d 457 [91 Cal.Rptr. 563]; <em>People </em>v. <em>Heath </em>(1968) 266 Cal.App.2d 754 [72 Cal.Rptr. 457]; <em>People </em>v. <em>Roberts </em>(1967) 256 Cal.App.2d 488 [64 Cal.Rptr. 70]; <em>People </em>v. <em>Maldonado </em>(1966) 240 Cal.App.2d 812 [50 Cal.Rptr. 45]; <em>People </em>v. <em>Hensel </em>(1965) 233 Cal.App.2d 834 [43 Cal.Rptr. 865]; <em>People </em>v. <em>Young </em>(1963) 214 Cal.App.2d 131 [29 Cal.Rptr. 492]; <em>People </em>v. <em>Norton </em>(1962) 209 Cal.App.2d 173 [25 Cal.Rptr. 676].)</p>\n<p id=\"b870-6\">In <em>Crafts, </em>the last of these \u201cdoorless stall\u201d cases, the court concluded that denials of petitions for hearings by this court of such cases indicated our acquiescence in their results and our consequent retreat from <em>Britt. Crafts </em>was the principal authority relied upon by the court below in denying defendant\u2019s motion to suppress.</p>\n<p id=\"b870-7\">Preliminarily we declare that our refusal to grant a hearing in a particular case is to be given <em>no </em>weight insofar as it might be deemed that we have acquiesced in the law as enunciated in a published opinion of a Court of Appeal when such opinion is in conflict with the law as stated by this court.  Our statements of law remain binding on the trial and <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"891\">*891</page-number>appellate courts of this state <em>(People </em>v. <em>McGuire </em>(1872) 45 Cal. 56, 57-58; <em>Auto Equity Sales, Inc. </em>v. <em>Superior Court </em>(1962) 57 Cal.2d 450, 455 [20 Cal.Rptr. 321, 369 P.2d 937]) and must be applied wherever the facts of a case are not fairly distinguishable from the facts of the case in which we have declared the applicable principle of law.  Our refusal to grant a hearing in any given case must not be deemed a sub silentio overruling of our prior decisions. \u201cThe significance of such refusal is no greater than this\u2014that this court does not consider that the interests of justice, or the purposes for which the power [to grant a hearing] was given, require its exercise in the particular case.\u201d <em>(People </em>v. <em>Davis </em>(1905) 147 Cal. 346, 350 [81 P. 718]; see also <em>Cole </em>v. <em>Rush </em>(1955) 45 Cal.2d 345, 351, fn. 3 [289 P.2d 450, 54 A.L.R.2d 1137].)</p>\n<p id=\"b871-5\">The People here urge us to hold that clandestine observation of door-less stalls in public restrooms is not a \u201csearch,\u201d and hence is not subject to the Fourth Amendment\u2019s prohibition of unreasonable searches. This would permit the police to make it a routine practice to observe from hidden vantage points the restroom conduct of the public whenever such activities do not occur within fully enclosed toilet stalls and would permit spying on the \u201cinnocent and guilty alike.\u201d Most persons using public restrooms have no reason to suspect that a hidden agent of the state will observe them.  The expectation of privacy a person has when he enters a restroom is reasonable and is not diminished or destroyed because the toilet stall being used lacks a door.</p>\n<p id=\"b871-6\">Reference to expectations of privacy as a Fourth Amendment touchstone received the endorsement of the United States Supreme Court in <em>Katz </em>v. <em>United States </em>(1968) 389 U.S. 347 [19 L.Ed.2d 576, 88 S.Ct. 507].  Viewed in the light of <em>Katz, </em>the standard for determining what is an illegal search is whether defendant\u2019s \u201creasonable expectation of privacy was violated by unreasonable governmental intrusion.\u201d <em>(People </em>v. <em>Edwards </em>(1969) 71 Cal.2d 1096, 1104 [80 Cal.Rptr. 633, 458 P.2d 713]; see also <em>Mancusi </em>v. <em>DeForte </em>(1968) 392 U.S. 364, 368 [20 L.Ed.2d 1154, 1160, 88 S.Ct. 2120].)</p>\n<p id=\"b871-8\">We do not retreat from our decisions in <em>Bielicki </em>and <em>Britt </em>and under the rationale of those opinions the suppression of the evidence used to convict defendant in the case at bench is required. As previously noted, <em>Bielicki </em>holds not only that general exploratory searches for evidence of guilt are violative of basic constitutional guarantees<footnotemark>5</footnotemark> but also that clan<page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"892\">*892</page-number>destine observations of the interior of toilet stalls are searches subject to Fourth Amendment strictures because occupants of toilet stalls can reasonably expect their activities within them to be private. We added in <em>Britt </em>that such observation remained a search and hence subject to the Fourth Amendment\u2019s ban against exploratory searches, even if the interior of the stall might have been open to view from areas accessible to the public.</p>\n<p id=\"b872-4\">The clandestine observations of restrooms does not fall from the purview of the Fourth Amendment merely through the removal of toilet stall doors.  We must remember in this regard that \u201cboth the United States Constitution and the California Constitution make it emphatically clear that important as efficient law enforcement may be, it is more important that the right of privacy guaranteed by these constitutional provisions be respected. [T]he contention that unreasonable searches and seizures are justified by the necessity of bringing criminals to justice cannot be accepted. It was rejected when the constitutional provisions were adopted and the choice was made that all the people, guilty and innocent alike, should be secure from unreasonable police intrusions, even though some criminals should escape.\u201d <em>(People </em>v. <em>Cahan </em>(1955) 44 Cal.2d 434, 438, 439 [282 P.2d 905, 52 A.L.R.2d 513].)</p>\n<p id=\"b873-4\"><page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"893\">*893</page-number>In seeking to honor reasonable expectations of privacy through our application of search and seizure law, we must consider the expectations of the innocent as well as the guilty. When innocent people are subjected to illegal searches\u2014including when, as here, they do not even know their private parts and bodily functions are being exposed to the gaze of the law\u2014their rights are violated even though such searches turn up no evidence of guilt. Save through the deterrent effect of the exclusionary rule there is little courts can do to protect the constitutional right of persons innocent of any crime to be free of unreasonable searches.</p>\n<p id=\"b873-5\">In addition to the constitutional issue previously discussed, the Legislature has recently made a declaration of its own regarding the reasonability of expectations of privacy in restrooms. Section 653n provides in pertinent part: \u201cAny person who installs or who maintains after April 1, 1970, any two-way mirror permitting observation of any restroom, toilet, bathroom, washroom, shower, locker room, fitting room, motel room, or hotel room, is guilty of a misdemeanor.</p>\n<p id=\"b873-6\">\u201c \u2018Two-way mirror\u2019 as used in this section means a mirror or other surface which permits any person on one side thereof to see through it under certain conditions of lighting, while any person on the other side thereof or other surface at that time can see only the usual mirror or other surface reflection.\u201d</p>\n<p id=\"b873-7\"><em>People </em>v. <em>Metcalf </em>(1971) 22 Cal.App.3d 20 [98 Cal.Rptr. 925], concerned a section 288 a violation witnessed by the arresting officer while secreted in a service closet adjacent to a department store restroom. The defendant occupied a doorless toilet stall; ids codefendant occupied the corridor running outside the stall. The crime was observed through louvers in the door of the closet in which the arresting officer was hidden.  The <em>Metcalf </em>court noted and rejected the line of cases departing from the <em>Bielicki-Britt </em>rule and reversed Metcalf\u2019s conviction, relying on section 653n: \u201cWe believe that the enactment of section 653n enunciates a public policy against clandestine observation of public restrooms and renders it reasonable for users thereof to expect that their privacy will not be surreptitiously violated. The method of surveillance employed in this case, in our opinion, violates the spirit and policy considerations which led to the enactment of section 653n and therefore should not be given this court\u2019s sanction.\u201d (22 Cal.App.3d at p. 23, citing <em>Katz </em>v. <em>United States, supra, </em>389 U.S. 347, and <em>People </em>v. <em>Edwards, supra, </em>71 Cal.2d 1096.)</p>\n<p id=\"b874-3\"><page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"894\">*894</page-number>We approve of the decision in <em>Metcalf. </em> The public policy declared in section 653n<footnotemark>6</footnotemark> is incompatible with the carte blanche which the People claim for clandestine surveillance of all areas of restrooms not fully enclosed by three walls and a door.<footnotemark>7</footnotemark></p>\n<p id=\"b874-4\">Having concluded the clandestine observation challenged in the case at bench was a search, we reach the issue of the legality of that search. We may assume, without deciding, that the search fell within one of the limited class of searches for which a warrant is not required. (Cf. <em>Warden </em>v. <em>Hayden </em>(1967) 387 U.S. 294 [18 L.Ed.2d 782, 87 S.Ct. 1642]; <em>Katz </em>v. <em>United States, supra.) </em>Nevertheless, \u201c[i]n enforcing the Fourth Amendment\u2019s prohibition against unreasonable searches and seizures, the [Supreme] Court has insisted upon probable cause as a minimum requirement for a reasonable search permitted by the Constitution.\u201d <em>(Chambers </em>v. <em>Maroney </em>(1970) 399 U.S. 42, 51 [26 L.Ed.2d 419, 428, 90 S.Ct. 1975].) Probable cause exists when at the moment officers make an arrest or conduct a search \u201cthe facts and circumstances within their knowledge and of which they had reasonably trustworthy information were sufficient to warrant a prudent man in believing that the [defendant] had committed or was committing an <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"895\">*895</page-number>offense.\u201d <em>(Beck </em>v. <em>Ohio </em>(1964) 379 U.S. 89, 91 [13 L.Ed.2d 142, 145, 85 S.Ct. 223].)<footnotemark>8</footnotemark></p>\n<p id=\"b875-5\">In the instant case it was conceded by the arresting officer that prior to embarking upon the search defendant had given authorities no cause to suspect him of criminal conduct aside from his prolonged stay in the restroom. It was also conceded that even this arguably suspicious behavior was susceptible to an innocent explanation. Since we have held that \u201cevents . . . as consistent with innocent activity as with criminal activity\u201d are insufficient to support the legality of an investigative detention <em>(Irwin </em>v. <em>Superior Court </em>(1969) 1 Cal.3d 423, 427 [82 Cal.Rptr. 484, 462 P.2d 12]), a fortiori such events cannot afford the police probable cause to search. (See <em>Terry </em>v. <em>Ohio </em>(1968) 392 U.S. 1, 20-22 [20 L.Ed.2d 889, 905-907, 88 S.Ct. 1868]; Beck v. <em>Ohio, supra) </em>\u201c[C]ommon rumor or report, suspicion, or even \u2018strong reason to suspect\u2019 \u201d have historically been inadequate to establish probable cause, and \u201cthat principle has survived to this day\u201d in the law of the Fourth Amendment and the law of this state. <em>(Henry </em>v. <em>United States </em>(1959) 361 U.S. 98, 101 [4 L.Ed.2d 134, 138, 80 S.Ct. 168]; see also <em>People </em>v. <em>Superior Court (Kiefer) </em>(1971) 3 Cal.3d 807, 813-828 [91 Cal.Rptr. 729, 478 P.2d 449].) Officer Aldahl therefore lacked probable cause to search the toilet stall occupied by defendant. His clandestine observation of defendant, \u201c \u2018prompted by a general curiosity to ascertain what, if anything,\u2019 \u201d was going on within the restroom, was \u201cmanifestly exploratory in nature, and violates both the letter and spirit of the Fourth Amendment.\u201d <em>(People </em>v. <em>Superior Court (Kiefer), supra, </em>3 Cal.3d at p. 831.)</p>\n<p id=\"b875-6\">Officer Aldahl\u2019s testimony as to what he observed was secured as a result of an illegal search <em>(Badillo </em>v. <em>Superior Court </em>(1956) 46 Cal.2d 269, 271 [294 P.2d 23]), and should have been excluded at trial. <em>(Mapp </em>v. <em>Ohio </em>(1961) 367 U.S. 643 [6 L.Ed.2d 1081, 81 S.Ct. 1684, 84 A.L.R.2d 933]; <em>People </em>v <em>Cahan, supra, </em>44 Cal.2d 434.)</p>\n<p id=\"b875-7\">The judgment is reversed.</p>\n<p id=\"b875-8\">McComb, J., Tobriner, J., Mosk, J., Burke, J., Sullivan, J., and Wood, J.,<footnotemark>*</footnotemark> * concurred.</p>\n<footnote label=\"1\">\n<p id=\"b867-10\">Unless otherwise indicated, all section references are to the Penal Code.</p>\n</footnote>\n<footnote label=\"2\">\n<p id=\"b867-11\">Defendant failed to make a section 1538.5 motion to suppress prior to trial but did seek to make a motion to suppress at trial (\u00a7 1538.5, subd. (h)) in order to make certain that the objection to the testimony made at the preliminary hearing was preserved on appeal despite the submission of the case on the transcript of the preliminary hearing. As the trial court specifically addressed itself to defendant's argument for suppression when the court delivered its judgment, it appears that the court did entertain the section 1538.5 motion made at trial. Although the People objected at trial to the court\u2019s consideration of the motion, they do not maintain that we are precluded from considering defendant\u2019s claim of illegal search and seizure on appeal.</p>\n<p id=\"b867-12\">The 1970 amendment to section 1538.5 (subd. (h)) removed the trial court's prior discretion to consider a section 1538.5 motion first made at the time of trial. (Stats. 1970, ch. 1441, p. 2800, \u00a7 1.5.) A section 1538.5 motion may now be made at trial only upon a showing of good cause why the opportunity to make the motion did not exist prior to trial. The restriction imposed by the 1970 amendment, however, is a limitation only on preconviction challenges of the admissibility of the evidence. (See <em>People </em>v. <em>Medina </em>(1972) 6 Cal.3d 484 [99 Cal.Rptr. 630, 492 P.2d 686]; see also <em>Thompson </em>v. <em>Superior Court </em>(1968) 262 Cal.App.2d 98, 106-107 [68 Cal.Rptr. 530].) \u201cA defendant may seek further review of the validity of a search or seizure on appeal from a conviction in a criminal case . . . providing that at some stage of the proceedings prior to conviction he has moved for the return of property or the suppression of the evidence.\u201d (\u00a7 1538.5, subd.

(m)). In any case', defendant is entitled to review of the denial of his section 995 motion on appeal from a judgment of conviction. (Pen.

I, \u00a7 19), it is often difficult to determine whether a case was disposed of on the basis of state or federal constitutional law. The issue is, of course, crucial to federal review of our decisions. <em>(California </em>v. <em>Krivda </em>(1972) 409 U.S. 33 [34 L.Ed.2d 45, 93 S.Ct. 32]; <em>Mental Hygiene Dept. </em>v. <em>Kirchner </em>(1965) 380 U.S. 194, 198 [13 L.Ed.2d 753, 756, 85 S.Ct. 871].)</p>\n<p id=\"b872-6\">In <em>People </em>v. <em>Cahan </em>(1955) 44 Cal.2d 434, 438 [282 P.2d 905, 50 A.L.R.2d 513], we stated that the \u201cguarantee of personal privacy\" set forth in article I, section 19, of the California Constitution is \u201cessentially identical\u201d to the rights secured by the Fourth Amendment. At least since the advent of <em>Wolf </em>v. <em>Colorado </em>(1949) 338 U.S. 25 [93 L.Ed. 1782, 69 S.Ct. 1359], we have treated the law under article I, section 19, of our state Constitution as \u201csubstantially equivalent\u201d to the Supreme Court\u2019s construction of the Fourth Amendment. (See <em>Blair </em>v. <em>Pitchess </em>(1971) 5 Cal.3d 258, 270-271, fn. 6 [96 Cal.Rptr. 42, 486 P.2d 1242, 47 A.L.R.3d 1206].) On at least one occasion, however, we have expressly departed from the federal rule to afford defendants a broader security against unreasonable searches and seizures than that required by the Supreme Court. (See <em>People </em>v. <em>Martin </em>(1955) 45 Cal.2d 755, 759-761 [290 P.2d 855] [vicarious exclusionary rule].) In interpreting our state Constitution, we of course retain the \u201cpower to impose higher standards on searches and seizures than required by the Federal Constitution.\u201d <em>(Cooper </em>v. <em>California </em>(1967) 386 U.S. 58, 62 [17 L.Ed.2d 730, 734, 87 S.Ct. 788].)</p>\n<p id=\"b872-7\">Although for the sake of convenience we often refer to constitutional guarantees, both state and federal, against unreasonable searches and seizures under the rubric of \u201cFourth Amendment\u201d rights, our decision today is based both upon our reading of applicable federal Fourth Amendment law arid our own determination of the proper construction of article I, section 19, of the California Constitution. <em>(People </em>v. <em>Krivda </em>(1973) 8 Cal.3d 623 [105 Cal.Rptr. 521, 504 P.2d 457].)</p>\n</footnote>\n<footnote label=\"6\">\n<p id=\"b874-5\">Although the legislative history of section 653n is fragmentary, it is clear that the measure did seek to declare and to protect reasonable expectations of privacy. As originally introduced in the Assembly, the bill which resulted in section 653n included a final paragraph (later deleted): \u201cHotel and motel lobbies or registration rooms and retail salesrooms are specifically declared not to be areas in which persons could reasonably expect to be free from being observed.\u201d The phraseology of this disclaimer persuasively suggests that the bill was intended to have the effect we give it today\u2014a declaration of areas within which the public <em>can </em>\u201creasonably expect to be free from being observed.\u201d (See Assem. Bill No. 1222 (1969 Reg. Sess., Mar. 25, 1969).)</p>\n</footnote>\n<footnote label=\"7\">\n<p id=\"b874-6\">The Attorney General claims that criminal acts are often committed inside restrooms within plain view of any member of the public who should happen to enter. Under such circumstances, the police need not resort to clandestine observation to apprehend individuals involved in such activities. When law enforcement officers suspect that crimes are being perpetrated, they are as free to enter restrooms as is any member of the public. Should they discover from a location open to the public, the commission of criminal acts, their observation of what is in plain view involves no search, and is not subject to the strictures of the Fourth Amendment. <em>(United States </em>v. <em>Lefkowitz </em>(1932) 285 U.S. 452, 465 [76 L.Ed. 877, 882, 52 S.Ct. 420, 82 A.L.R. 775]; <em>Ker </em>v. <em>California </em>(1963) 374 U.S. 23, 43 [10 L.Ed.2d 726, 744, 83 S.Ct. 1623].) But for such observation to be a plain view rather than constituting a search, the officer must have had \u201ca right to be in the position to have that view. . . .\u201d <em>(Harris </em>v. <em>United States </em>(1968) 390 U.S. 234, 236 [19 L.Ed.2d 1067, 1069, 88 S.Ct. 992].) Unless he has probable cause to search, an officer has no right to retreat to a clandestine position to peer into a restroom, and knowledge gained by or attributable to such clandestine observations suffers from constitutional infirmities which require its exclusion as evidence in a case. To the extent that they are inconsistent with this statement of the law, the post <em>Bielicki-Britt </em>cases cited, <em>ante, </em>at page 890 are disapproved.</p>\n</footnote>\n<footnote label=\"8\">\n<p id=\"b875-9\">While <em>Beck </em>defined probable cause in the context of probable cause to arrest, the same standard applies to probable cause to search.
