We have concluded that City\u2019s ordinance was authorized by the provisions of section 38774, and that compliance with zoning law procedures was therefore unnecessary.</p>\n<p id=\"b768-5\">City\u2019s ordinance was enacted on June 23, 1965 and took effect on July 23, 1965. That ordinance, entitled \u201cFreeway Sign Control,\u201d prohibits the placing or maintaining of advertising signs, structures, or displays on property adjacent to freeways and declares that the placement or maintenance of advertising displays on such property (following a three-year grace period) is a nuisance.<footnotemark>4</footnotemark> City admits that the ordinance was not enacted in accordance with the procedural requirements for the enactment of zoning ordinances but asserts that it was properly adopted under the procedures for the enactment of general city ordinances under City\u2019s police power.<footnotemark>5</footnotemark></p>\n<p id=\"b769-3\"><page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"789\">*789</page-number>The trial court found that the signboard violated the ordinance and ordered that it be removed within 90 days. Defendants have appealed the adverse judgment. In essence, defendants contend that Government Code section 38774 does not authorize a city to regulate the erection, maintenance or location of signboards but only the exhibition and posting of advertisements on such signboards. In other words, defendants would restrict the application of section 38774 to the placement of advertisements on signboards, and not to the placement of signboard structures on property adjacent to public streets.  We believe, however, that defendants\u2019 interpretation of section 38774 is too narrow, and that the section would authorize the regulation of signboard structures which, by reason of their proximity to a freeway, have been declared to be nuisances.</p>\n<p id=\"b769-4\">Section 38774 grants cities the authority to \u201c. . . Regulate the exhibition [and] posting . . . of . . . signs, or advertisements in or on the street, or on or upon . . . billboards, or other structures . . . .\u201d The word \u201csigns\u201d reasonably may be construed to include the signboard structures themselves, given the evident purpose underlying section 38774 to permit municipal regulation of potential nuisances arising from the proximity of various types of outdoor advertising to streets, buildings and other public places.</p>\n<p id=\"b769-5\">As we have seen (fn. 1, <em>ante), </em>section 38774 is one of a group of sections which empower cities to regulate nuisances. Under section 38771, \u201cBy ordinance the city legislative body may declare what constitutes a nuisance,\u201d and under section 38773, a city may by ordinance provide for the abatement of a nuisance. Section 38774 specifies a particular type of nuisance subject to municipal control, and authorizes cities to \u201cregulate\u201d the exhibition and posting of signs and advertisements.</p>\n<p id=\"b769-6\">On the other hand, former Government Code section 65800, subdivision (b), on which defendants rely, made no reference to advertising signs and billboards, but merely authorized the legislative body to adopt ordinances regulating the location of buildings and \u201cstructures.\u201d That section constituted the authority for cities to enact comprehensive zoning ordinances generally, in accordance with specified procedures. (See fn. 5, <em>ante.) </em>It is a <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"790\">*790</page-number>fundamental rule of statutory construction that when a general statute appears to conflict with a special act, the latter will be considered an exception to the former. <em>(People </em>v. <em>Gilbert, </em>1 Cal.3d 475, 479-480 [82 Cal.Rptr. 724, 462 P.2d 580]; see 45 Cal.Jur.2d, Statutes, \u00a7 120, and cases cited.) Accordingly, we deem section 38774 an exception to the general provisions of former section 65800, and we conclude that City\u2019s ordinance was not required to be enacted in accordance with zoning ordinance procedures.</p>\n<p id=\"b770-5\">We do not view our interpretation of section 38774 as vesting a city with unreasonably broad police powers in this area.  Although it is generally held that a municipality\u2019s power to regulate lawful businesses may not be used to prohibit them entirely (see <em>Parker </em>v. <em>Colburn, </em>196 Cal. 169, 176 [236 P. 921]; 3 Witkin, Summary of Cal. Law (1960) Constitutional Law, \u00a7 160, p. 1971; 11 Cal.Jur.2d, Constitutional Law, \u00a7 149, p. 529, and fn. 14), that rule does not apply to a business whose operation constitutes a nuisance, inimical to the public welfare (see <em>Sunset Amusement Co. </em>v. <em>Board of Police Commissioners, 7 </em>Cal.3d 64, 80 [101 Cal.Rptr. 768, 496 P.2d 840]; <em>Jones </em>v. <em>City of Los Angeles, </em>211 Cal. 304, 315 [295 P. 14]).  It should be remembered that, in the instant case, City\u2019s ordinance declares advertising adjacent to its freeways to be a nuisance, and that the reach of section 38774 seemingly extends no further than to permit regulation of such nuisances. (See fn. 1, <em>ante.)</em></p>\n<p id=\"b770-7\">Moreover, City\u2019s ordinance does not purport to prohibit all signs and advertisements but only to regulate their location so that they do not constitute nuisances and for the obvious purposes of promoting highway safety as well as enhancing community aesthetic values. The case of <em>Varney &amp; Green </em>v. <em>Williams, </em>155. Cal. 318 [100 P. 867], is readily distinguishable. There the court held invalid an ordinance which forbade all advertising billboards within city limits. (See also <em>Metromedia, Inc. </em>v. <em>City of Pasadena, </em>216 Cal.App.2d 270, 273-274 [30 Cal.Rptr. 731].)</p>\n<p id=\"b770-8\">We emphasize that ordinarily municipalities must follow statutory or charter zoning procedures strictly whenever they propose a substantial interference with land use, for such procedures are constitutionally mandated to. insure that private property owners receive due process of law. (See <em>Scott </em>v. <em>City of Indian Wells, 6 </em>Cal.3d 541, 549 [99 Cal.Rptr. 745, 492 P.2d 1137]; <em>Hurst </em>v. <em>City of Burlingame, </em>207 Cal. 134, 141 [277 P. 308]; 55 Cal.Jur.2d, Zoning, \u00a7 109; McQuillin, Municipal Corporations, \u00a7\u00a7 25.40, 25.46.) In the instant case, however, defendants have failed to establish any such substantial interference. In plaintiff\u2019s view, section 38774 would permit the exclusion of signboards adjacent to freeways, whereas, under defendants\u2019 <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"791\">*791</page-number>interpretation, only the advertisements themselves could be prohibited. Since the practical effect (in terms of restricted land use) would be the same, it is evident that we must scrutinize not the method but the <em>extent </em>of City\u2019s regulation in order to determine whether zoning procedures should have been followed. (See McQuillin, <em>supra, </em>\u00a7 25.53.) Whether a particular interference with, or restriction upon, land use is a substantial one, requiring compliance with applicable zoning procedures, can be determined only by examining the facts of each particular case. <em>(Id.., </em>\u00a7 25.46.) In the instant case, City\u2019s ordinance is narrowly limited to advertising displays adjacent to freeways and designed to be viewed primarily by freeway travelers; reasonable exemptions are made for advertisements affecting the property upon which the signboards stand. We conclude that the restrictions upon land use resulting from City\u2019s ordinance were minimal, and that accordingly that ordinance was properly enacted as a general police measure under section 38774 of the Government Code.<footnotemark>6</footnotemark></p>\n<p id=\"b771-4\">The judgment is affirmed.</p>\n<p id=\"b771-5\">Sullivan, Acting C. J., McComb, J., Tobriner, J., Mosk, J., and Schauer, J.,<footnotemark>*</footnotemark> concurred.</p>\n<p id=\"b771-6\">Appellants\u2019 petition for a rehearing was denied March 8, 1973. Wright, C. J., did not participate therein.</p>\n<footnote label=\"1\">\n<p id=\"b767-10\">Section 38774, contained in an article of the Government Code pertaining to \u201cNuisances,\u201d provides that \u201cThe legislative body [of a city] may:</p>\n<blockquote id=\"b767-11\">\u201c(a) Regulate the exhibition, posting, or carrying of banners, placards, posters, cards, pictures, signs, or advertisements in or on the street, or on or upon buildings, fences, billboards, or other structures; or on or upon any pole in any sidewalk, alley, street, lane, court, park, or other public place.</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b767-12\">\u201c(b) Regulate the suspension of banners, flags, signs, advertisements, posters, pictures, or cards across, or over any sidewalk, alley, street, lane, court, park, or other public place, or such suspension from fences, poles, houses, or other structures.\u201d</blockquote>\n<p id=\"b767-13\">Other sections of the article permit a city to declare by ordinance what constitutes a nuisance (\u00a7 38771), to provide for the summary abatement of any nuisance (\u00a7 38773), and to \u201cprohibit and prevent encroachments upon or obstruction in or to any sidewalks, street, alley, lane, court, park, or other public place and provide for the removal of such encroachment or obstruction.\u201d (\u00a7 38775.)</p>\n</footnote>\n<footnote label=\"2\">\n<p id=\"b767-14\">See Government Code section 36931 et seq.</p>\n</footnote>\n<footnote label=\"3\">\n<p id=\"b768-6\">Former section 65800 provided that \u201cPursuant to the provisions of this chapter [\u201czoning regulations\u201d], the legislative body of any county or city by ordinance may:</p>\n<blockquote id=\"AvR\">\u201c(a) Regulate the use of buildings, structures, and land as between agriculture, industry, business, residence and other purposes.</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b768-7\">\u201c(b) Regulate location, height, bulk, number of stories, and size of buildings and structures; the sizes of yards, courts and other open spaces; the percentage of a lot which may be occupied by a building or structure. . . .\u201d</blockquote>\n<p id=\"b768-8\">In 1965, following the enactment of City\u2019s ordinance, section 65850 was adopted, with substantially identical language as former section 65800, but including as new subdivision (b) the words \u201cRegulate signs and billboards.\u201d Therefore, the new section expressly includes signs and billboards within the type of structures which could be regulated by a zoning ordinance.</p>\n<p id=\"b768-9\">Thereafter, in 1967, section 5288.7 was added to the Business and Professions Code as part of the so-called \u201cOutdoor Advertising Act.\u201d That section, now renumbered as section 5230,- permits cities and counties to enact ordinances \u201cincluding, but not limited to, land use or zoning ordinances, imposing restrictions on advertising displays [which would include signs and structures, under \u00a7 5202] adjacent to any street, road, or highway equal to or greater than those imposed by this chapter.\u201d Therefore, in spite of the expansion of the Planning and Zoning Law to include regulation of signs and billboards by zoning laws (Gov. Code, \u00a7 65850, subd. (b)), cities appear to retain, under section 5230 of the Business and Professions Code, authority to regulate such matters by general ordinance. Note, however, that section 5230 and other provisions of the Outdoor Advertising Act apply only to a limited extent to advertising displays in incorporated areas. (Bus. &amp; Prof. Code, \u00a7 5271.)</p>\n</footnote>\n<footnote label=\"4\">\n<p id=\"b768-10\">City\u2019s ordinance also exempts from its provisions any advertising display which offers for sale or lease the property upon which the display stands, which designates the name of the property owner or identifies the property, or which advertises the business conducted on the property.</p>\n</footnote>\n<footnote label=\"5\">\n<p id=\"b768-11\">The constitutional authority of a general law city such as plaintiff is limited to the enactment of ordinances \u201cnot in conflict with general laws.\u201d (Former Const., art. XI, <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"789\">*789</page-number>\u00a7 11, now art. XI, \u00a7 7.) One such \u201cgeneral law\u201d is the so-called \u201cPlanning and Zoning Law\" (Gov. Code, \u00a7 65000 et seq.) which, in 1965, required a public hearing before the planning commission, commission approval by at least a two-thirds vote, and city council adoption, following an additional public hearing, in order to enact a zoning measure. (See former Gov. Code, \u00a7\u00a7 65650-65654, 65803, Stats. 1953, ch. 1355, pp. 2924, 2927.) City contends that its ordinance was not enacted as a zoning measure under the authority of the Planning and Zoning Law, but as a police power measure expressly authorized by Government Code section 38774.</p>\n</footnote>\n<footnote label=\"6\">\n<p id=\"b771-7\">Defendants have also argued that the Outdoor Advertising Act (Bus. &amp; Prof. Code, \u00a7 5200 et seq.), in effect when City\u2019s ordinance was enacted, preempted the regulation of advertising displays, including structures maintained for outdoor advertising purposes (see Bus. &amp; Prof. Code, \u00a7\u00a7 5204, 5205), except by local ordinances enacted in accordance with the Planning and Zoning Law (former Gov. Code, \u00a7 65000 et seq.). (See former Bus. &amp; Prof. Code, \u00a7 5227.) Yet former section 5226 of the act specifically excluded from the act\u2019s operation territory located within incorporated cities and towns, and former section 5227 pertained to <em>counties, </em>not cities. Accordingly, the Outdoor Advertising Act did not restrict City\u2019s authority to adopt Ordinance No. 1018.</p>\n</footnote>\n<footnote label=\"*\">\n<p id=\"b771-8\">Retired Associate Justice of the Supreme Court sitting under assignment by the Chairman of the Judicial Council.</p>\n</footnote>\n</opinion>\n</casebody>\n",
