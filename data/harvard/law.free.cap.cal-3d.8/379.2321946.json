Code, \u00a7 4500). A jury found defendants guilty as charged and fixed Cannady\u2019s penalty at death and Beard\u2019s at life imprisonment. Cannady\u2019s automatic appeal is now before us (Pen. Code, \u00a7 1239, subd. (b)), and Beard\u2019s appeal from the judgment has been consolidated therewith.</p>\n<p id=\"b375-3\"><page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"383\">*383</page-number>Defendants contend that the co\u00fart erred in admitting at the guilt trial prior consistent statements of witnesses as substantive evidence, defendants were denied a fair trial as a result of specified matters, the court erred in failing to give instructions on-manslaughter and defense of another, and the court improperly gave an instruction on flight and misread an instruction in a manner prejudicial to defendants.  We have concluded that none of the contentions can be upheld but that, since the death penalty cannot constitutionally be imposed here, the judgment entered against Cannady should be modified in accordance with <em>People </em>v. <em>Anderson, 6 </em>Cal.3d 628 [100 Cal.Rptr. 152, 493 P.2d 880].<footnotemark>1</footnotemark> (See also <em>Furman </em>v. <em>Georgia, </em>408 U.S. 238 [33 L.Ed.2d 346, 92 S.Ct. 2726],) We affirm that judgment as so modified and the judgment entered against Beard.</p>\n<p id=\"b375-4\">On the morning of April 29, 1969, Lloyd Kelley (known as Coach Kelley), the supervisor of recreation at Folsom Prison, had a conversation in his office with the alleged victim, \u201cShiek\u201d Thompson, and another inmate named Howard Cooper. Before the conversation terminated, Cooper left to go to the restroom after having noticed Cannady beckoning outside the office. En route Cooper asked Cannady what he wanted. Cannady replied that he did not want Cooper but was beckoning \u201cfor the snitch inside,\u201d apparently referring to Thompson. Cooper saw Cannady was holding an aluminum baseball bat behind him. Such bats are never properly at any location other than the athletic office or the baseball field without authorization by the coach. Cooper also observed Beard standing near the coach\u2019s office and saw him in the same spot upon Cooper\u2019s return from the restroom.</p>\n<p id=\"b375-5\">After the conversation between Coach Kelley and Thompson ended, Thompson went into an adjacent room called the \u201cissue room,\u201d in which athletic equipment was handed out. Less than a minute later Kelley heard loud voices in the \u201cissue room.\u201d He looked out, saw Thompson in the \u201cissue room\u201d and Cannady outside the room, and heard Thompson say \u201cWhat the heck\u2019s the matter with you?\u201d As the coach went into the \u201cissue room,\u201d he saw Cannady pick up an aluminum baseball bat, which was leaning against the exterior wall of the \u201cissue room,\u201d and make a thrusting <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"384\">*384</page-number>motion with the bat toward Thompson. Thompson at first tried to ward off the bat and then took hold of its opposite end. After Cannady entered the \u201cissue room,\u201d Kelley attempted to grab the bat but was unsuccessful. Thompson managed to push Cannady to a point where the bat protruded out the door and hollered \u201cTake the bat,\u201d apparently to someone outside. Beard stepped up as if to take the bat but instead pushed it aside and shoved a knife into Thompson\u2019s chest. Beard and Cannady thereupon pushed Thompson over to a desk. Cannady and Thompson both still held the bat, Thompson released it when Beard tried to stab him again. Beard stabbed Thompson twice, and Cannady beat Thompson on the head with the bat and also beat Thompson\u2019s leg with the bat until a bone was \u201csticking out.\u201d</p>\n<p id=\"b376-4\">Kelley left to summon aid. Upon his return with two officers, he saw defendants going in the general direction of a guard post. Thompson was lying on the floor of the \u201cissue room\u201d and near him were the bat and knife.</p>\n<p id=\"b376-5\">Thompson died a few minutes after being brought to a physician immediately after the alleged assault. The physician and the autopsy surgeon testified concerning Thompson\u2019s extensive injuries, including head wounds, a fractured leg, and stab wounds in his chest. According - to the physician, the cause of death was the stab wounds, which involved the heart and both lungs, and contributory causes were possible concussion and fracture of both bones in one leg. The autopsy surgeon testified that the cause of death was stab wounds to the lungs.</p>\n<p id=\"b376-6\">Beard and Cannady were apprehended shortly after the incident. At the time of their apprehension Beard was outside the \u201cissue room\u201d and Cannady was in the prison recreation yard. The two men were then examined for injuries. No injuries were found on Cannady, and Beard had only a superficial scratch on his knee apart from a scratch treated before the alleged assault.</p>\n<p id=\"b376-7\">It was stipulated that each defendant was undergoing a life sentence in a California prison at the time of the alleged assault.</p>\n<p id=\"b376-8\">The defense presented was self-defense. Both defendants took the stand in their own behalf. Cannady testified: In the morning, before the incident, he had an argument with Thompson. He did not see Thompson again until the early afternoon when- Cannady was near the \u201cissue room\u201d and heard someone yell \u201cLook out.\u201d Cannady turned and saw Thompson coming toward him with a knife. Thompson lunged at him. Cannady caught Thompson\u2019s hand, and Thompson grabbed Cannady\u2019s jacket and <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"385\">*385</page-number>pulled him into the \u201cissue room.\u201d After trying unsuccessfully to get away, Cannady took a bat from a rack in the \u201cissue room\u201d and hit Thompson with it. Thompson eventually got the bat from him. Cannady was part way down when Beard entered the affray. Beard pulled Thompson off Cannady, at which point Cannady left. Cannady acted in self-defense at all times. He was originally committed to prison for second degree robbery and assault and was convicted in 1963 of possession of a deadly weapon by an inmate and in 1964 of assault of another inmate in violation of section 4500.</p>\n<p id=\"b377-4\">Beard testified: He saw a group of inmates near the \u201cissue room\u201d and knew something was wrong. He went inside and saw Thompson holding someone (who he later' found was Cannady) on the ground. At first Beard thought they were playing but realized they were fighting when he saw they were wrestling for the bat. Beard was then unarmed. He grabbed Thompson and pulled him up. Beard saw that Thompson had a knife in one hand and the bat in his other hand. Beard grabbed Thompson\u2019s hand that held the knife and following a struggle Thompson dropped the knife and Beard obtained it. Thompson tried to hit Beard with the bat and Beard stabbed Thompson, who then fell. Beard heard people saying that he \u201cbetter leave,\u201d and he did so. So far as Beard knew Cannady was gone when Beard obtained the knife.</p>\n<p id=\"b377-5\">Several inmates, called as defense witnesses, testified that they saw Thompson grab Cannady and saw a knife in Thompson\u2019s hand. The defense also presented evidence of Thompson\u2019s aggressive nature.</p>\n<p id=\"b377-6\">The recited evidence manifestly is sufficient to support the convictions, and no claim is made to the contrary. As heretofore stated, however, defendants seek to have the judgments set aside on the following grounds:</p>\n<p id=\"b377-7\">I. <em>Receipt of Prior Consistent Statements as Substantive Evidence</em></p>\n<p id=\"b377-8\">Defendants contend that the. admission into evidence of two prosecution witnesses\u2019 prior consistent statements as substantive evidence under Evidence Code section 1236<footnotemark>2</footnotemark> violated their right of confrontation guaranteed by the Sixth Amendment of the federal Constitution.</p>\n<p id=\"b378-3\"><page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"386\">*386</page-number>The first prosecution witness, Coach Kelley, testified that he saw Cannady pick up a bat, which was against the exterior wall of the \u201cissue room,\u201d before thrusting it at Thompson. To impeach Kelley, defense counsel asked him on cross-examination whether he had not made a report in April 1969 containing a specified description of the incident, which description did not mention having seen Cannady pick up the bat, and Kelley responded in the affirmative. Thereafter the prosecutor on redirect examination of Kelley elicited the statement that he had testified before the grand jury in May 1969 that \u201c. . . Cannady picked up the bat. . . .\u201d</p>\n<p id=\"b378-4\">The second prosecution witness, Cooper, testified on direct examination to his version of the alleged assault. To impeach him, defense counsel asked him on cross-examination whether he had stated that he did not know anything about the incident when he talked to (1) the public defender\u2019s investigator a week before the trial and (2) the district attorney\u2019s investigator shortly after the alleged assault. Cooper replied that he had told the investigators that he did not have anything to say to them. Defense counsel also cross-examined Cooper concerning representations made to him by the prosecutor on October 1, 1969, the day before Cooper testified, and Cooper stated that the prosecutor had told him \u201cthe judge can rehear your case.\u201d For the purpose of rehabilitating Cooper, the prosecutor on cross-examination of the district attorney\u2019s investigator elicited testimony that when he had interviewed Cooper a second time, in June 1969, Cooper gave a narration concerning the alleged assault, which narration was substantially in accord with his testimony at trial.</p>\n<p id=\"b378-5\">No instructions were given limiting the purpose for which the prior consistent statements were admitted.</p>\n<p id=\"b378-6\">In support of their contention that the receipt of the prior consistent statements as substantive evidence under section 1236 violated their Sixth Amendment right of confrontation, defendants rely upon <em>People </em>v. <em>Washington </em>(1969) 71 Cal.2d 1061, 1076 [80 Cal.Rptr. 567, 458 P.2d 479], which held that \u201cunder the rationale of <em>[People </em>v. <em>Johnson, </em>68 Cal.2d 646 [68 Cal.Rptr. 599, 441 P.2d 111]], and based upon the Sixth Amendment, Evidence Code section 1236 is unconstitutional in criminal cases insofar as it permits the substantive use of prior consistent statements against defendant.\u201d The rationale of <em>Johnson, </em>however, was specifically rejected in <em>California </em>v. <em>Green </em>(1970) 399 U.S. 149 [26 L.Ed.2d 489, 90 S.Ct. 1930], In <em>Green, </em>which concerned the admissibility of prior <em>inconsistent </em>statements by a witness (1) at the preliminary hearing and (2) to an <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"387\">*387</page-number>officer, the United States Supreme Court declared (pp. 158, 161 [26 L.Ed.2d pp. 497, 499]), \u201cViewed historically . . . there is good reason to conclude that the Confrontation Clause is not violated by admitting a declarant\u2019s out-of-court statements, as long as the declarant is testifying as a witness and subject to full and effective cross-examination. . . . [N]one of our decisions interpreting the Confrontation Clause requires excluding the out-of-court statements of a witness who is available and testifying at trial.\u201d</p>\n<p id=\"b379-4\">Kelley and Cooper testified at the trial and were then subject to full and effective cross-examination. Accordingly, the receipt of their prior consistent statements did not violate defendants\u2019 Sixth Amendment right of confrontation. (See <em>California </em>v. <em>Green, supra, </em>399 U.S. 149; <em>People </em>v. <em>Bynum, </em>4 Cal.3d 589, 603 [94 Cal.Rptr. 241, 483 P.2d 1193]; <em>People </em>v. <em>Green, </em>3 Cal.3d 981 [92 Cal.Rptr. 494, 479 P.2d 998] [cert. dismissed 404 U.S. 801 (30 L.Ed.2d 34, 92 S.Ct. 20)].)</p>\n<p id=\"b379-5\">Defendants also argue that the substantive use of the prior consistent statements violated the due process clause of article I, section 13, of the California Constitution. They rely upon <em>People </em>v. <em>Washington, supra, </em>71 Cal.2d 1061. <em>Washington, </em>however, was based on the federal Constitution, and, as heretofore stated, the rationale upon which <em>Washington </em>relied was rejected in <em>California </em>v. <em>Green, supra, </em>399 U.S. 149.</p>\n<p id=\"b379-6\">Furthermore, at the trial no objection was made to the admission of the prior consistent statements for their substantive use on the grounds now urged. As a general rule, the admissibility of evidence will not be reviewed on appeal in the absence of a specific and timely objection at the trial <em>(People </em>v. <em>Mabry, </em>71 Cal.2d 430 441 [78 Cal.Rptr. 655, 455 P.2d 759]; <em>People </em>v. <em>De Santiago, 71 </em>Cal.2d 18, 22 [76 Cal.Rptr. 809, 453 P.2d 353]; <em>People </em>v. <em>Robinson, </em>62 Cal.2d 889, 894 [44 Cal.Rptr. 762, 402 P.2d 834]). Defendants, however, argue that the foregoing rule is inapplicable since defendants\u2019 trial was before <em>People </em>v. <em>Washington, supra, </em>71 Cal.2d 1061, \u201cbecame generally available to the profession.\u201d</p>\n<p id=\"b379-7\"><em>Washington </em>was filed about two weeks <em>before </em>defendants\u2019 trial began, but, even if it had not been filed until after defendants\u2019 trial, they would not have been excused from making an objection unless <em>Washington </em>\u201c \u2018represented such a substantial change in the former rule as to excuse an objection anticipating that decision.\u2019 \u201d <em>(People </em>v. <em>Groves, </em>71 Cal.2d 1196, 1198 [80 Cal.Rptr. 745, 458 P.2d 985]; <em>People </em>v. <em>De Santiago, supra, </em>71 Cal.2d 18, 22.)</p>\n<p id=\"b379-8\">Although <em>Washington </em>was the first case to hold that the admission of prior <em>consistent </em>statements as substantive evidence under section 1236 <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"388\">*388</page-number>violated the defendant\u2019s right of confrontation under the Sixth Amendment, that holding was required by <em>People </em>v. <em>Johnson, supra, </em>68 Cal.2d 646, a case decided over a year before defendants\u2019 trial. <em>Johnson </em>involved the admission of prior <em>inconsistent </em>statements as substantive evidence under Evidence Code section 1235, but this court noted in <em>Washington </em>(p. 1075), \u201cWe are unable to perceive any basic difference between the admission as substantive evidence of prior <em>inconsistent </em>statements of a witness on the one hand and prior <em>consistent </em>statements on the other. There appears to be no significant factor present in the former situation whose absence in the latter would obviate any infringement of a defendant\u2019s constitutional right to confrontation in a criminal case.\u201d Accordingly, <em>Washington </em>did not \u201crepresent such a substantial change in the former rule as to excuse an objection anticipating that decision.\u201d</p>\n<p id=\"b380-4\">Defendants further argue that Cooper\u2019s prior consistent statement was inadmissible under Evidence Code section 1236 because the prosecution complied with only one of the two conditions set forth in section 791, subdivision '(b), of that code. (See fn. 2 herein.)  Defendants admit that there was an express or implied charge by defense counsel that Cooper\u2019s testimony was recently fabricated, but they assert that the prosecution failed to show that \u201cthe statement was made before the . . . motive for fabrication ... is alleged to have arisen.\u201d However, one motive for fabrication was the representation by the prosecutor that \u201cthe judge can rehear [Cooper\u2019s] case,\u201d and Cooper\u2019s prior statement preceded that representation. That there may always have existed another motive for fabricating did not deprive the prosecution of its right to show that a motive shown by the evidence did not affect the witness\u2019 testimony. (See <em>People </em>v. <em>Duvall, </em>262 Cal.App.2d 417, 421 [68 Cal.Rptr. 708].) Furthermore, no objection was made at the trial on the ground now urged, and defendants have shown no circumstances that would justify our departure from the ordinary r,ule that errors not challenged at trial cannot serve as grounds for reversal on appeal.</p>\n<p id=\"b380-5\">No claim is made that Kelley\u2019s prior consistent statement was inadmissible on the ground that the conditions in Evidence Code section 791 were not fulfilled, and no objection was made on that ground at the trial. The admissibility of that evidence under section 791 will therefore not be reviewed on appeal.</p>\n<p id=\"b380-6\">II. <em>Asserted Denial of a Fair Trial</em></p>\n<p id=\"b380-7\">Defendants further contend that they were denied a fair trial in that, although they were charged with violating Penal Code section 4500, the <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"389\">*389</page-number>trial was conducted as if the charge was murder.  In this connection they first argue that it was improper to admit the testimony of the physician and autopsy surgeon concerning Thompson\u2019s death because, assertedly, the fact of his death was irrelevant. Defendants admit that no objection was made to- the evidence at the trial. Even had an objection on the ground of relevancy been made at the trial, it would not have been error to admit the testimony. <em>(People </em>v. <em>Berry, </em>44 Cal.2d 426, 431 [282 P.2d 861] [overruled on another ground in <em>People </em>v. <em>St. Martin, </em>1 Cal.3d 524, 537 (83 Cal.Rptr. 166, 463 P.2d 390)].) The findings of the physicians and their opinions as to the cause of death were relevant in the determination of the amount of force used and, consequently, of the mental attitude of each defendant at the time of the assault.</p>\n<p id=\"b381-4\">Defendants further argue that certain instructions, some of which were offered by the prosecution and others by the defense, improperly used terms such as \u201cfatal blow\u201d and \u201chomicide\u201d\u2014that such instructions emphasized to the jury that it \u201cwas dealing with a case of homicide\u201d and \u201ccould have no other effect than to prejudice and confuse the jury.\u201d However, as we have seen, evidence of the victim\u2019s death was properly admitted, and since the jury was aware of his death it is clear that the references in the instructions to the terms in question would not have prejudiced the jury against defendants. Nor would the references have confused the jury. The instructions given made clear the charge against defendants and the various possible verdicts'.</p>\n<p id=\"b381-5\">III. <em>Asserted Error in Failing to Give Certain Instructions</em></p>\n<p id=\"AQM\">A. <em>Manslaughter Instruction</em></p>\n<p id=\"b381-6\">Defendants contend that the court erred in failing to give an instruction on manslaughter.<footnotemark>3</footnotemark>\n                   Although under some circumstances a manslaughter instruction must be given in a prosecution for violating Penal Code section 4500 (see <em>People </em>v. <em>St. Martin, supra, </em>1 Cal.3d 524, 532-536), here, as we shall see, the court properly did not give such an instruction.</p>\n<p id=\"b381-7\">A defendant cannot be convicted of an offense (other than a necessarily included offense) not charged against him by indictment or information whether or not there was evidence at his trial to show that he had committed that offense. <em>(In re Hess, </em>45 Cal.2d 171, 174-175 [288 <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"390\">*390</page-number>P.2d 5].)  \u201cTwo different types of necessarily included offenses have been recognized in this state. First, where one offense cannot be committed without committing another offense, the latter offense is a necessarily included offense. [Citation.] Second, a lesser offense is necessarily included if it is within the offense specifically charged in the accusatory pleading, as distinguished from the statutory definition of the crime. [Citations.]\u201d <em>(People </em>v. <em>St. Martin, supra, </em>1 Cal.3d 524, 536.) Under the first test manslaughter is not a necessarily included offense in the offense proscribed by section 4500, since, of course, the latter crime can be committed without committing manslaughter.  Nor in the instant case under the second test is manslaughter a necessarily included offense in the crime proscribed by section 4500 since the indictment did not allege that the victim died as a result of the alleged section 4500 assault. This case thus differs from <em>People </em>v. <em>St. Martin, supra, </em>wherein the indictment alleged that the victim died as a result of the felonious assault.</p>\n<p id=\"b382-5\">B. <em>Instruction Regarding Defense of Another</em></p>\n<p id=\"b382-6\">Beard contends that the court erred in failing to give an instruction on defense of a third person (see Pen. Code, \u00a7 <em>694; People </em>v. <em>Craig, </em>152 Cal. 42, 50 [91 P. 997]; 1 Witkin, Cal. Crimes (1963) p. 157). He asserts that if an instruction he requested regarding that defense that the court declined to give was defective, it was the court\u2019s duty to give <em>sua sponte </em>a correct instruction on the subject. He points to his own testimony from which it appears that he entered the affray to aid Cannady, who, according to Cannady\u2019s testimony, had been attacked by Thompson. However, it also appears from Beard\u2019s testimony that he was unarmed when he entered the affray; that it was only after Beard pulled Thompson off Cannady and Thompson dropped the knife that Beard obtained the knife and stabbed Thompson; and that so far as Bear'd knew Cannady was gone when Beard obtained the knife. Cannady testified that he left when Beard pulled Thompson off him. When Beard was asked why he struck Thompson with the knife, Beard replied that he was scared of Thompson, that Thompson was \u201ccoming at\u201d him with the bat, and that he knew Thompson would try to kill him. Accordingly it appears from the defense testimony that Beard assaulted Thompson with a deadly weapon in defense of himself\u2014not in defense of Cannady. The testimony thus did not warrant an instruction on defense of another. The court gave instructions on self-defense as proposed by defendants.</p>\n<p id=\"b383-3\"><page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"391\">*391</page-number>IV. <em>Instruction on Flight</em></p>\n<p id=\"b383-4\">Defendants contend that the court erred in giving an instruction on flight<footnotemark>4</footnotemark> because, assertedly, the evidence did not warrant the instruction. They point to the fact that they were going in the general direction of a guard post after leaving the room where the alleged assault occurred, and they assert that this fact \u201crather than indicating consciousness of guilt, is more consistent with an attempt to report the affray ... to the guards.\u201d However, the jury could reasonably infer that defendants\u2019 flight reflected consciousness of guilt.  Flight requires neither the physical act of running nor the reaching of a far-away haven.  The evidence is sufficient to support the giving of the instruction. (See, e.g., <em>People </em>v. <em>Hutchinson, </em>71 Cal.2d 342, 346 [78 Cal.Rptr. 196, 455 P.2d 132]; <em>People </em>v. <em>Murguia, </em>6 Cal.2d 190, 192 [57 P.2d 115]; <em>People </em>v. <em>Hinshaw, </em>194 Cal. 1, 26-27 [227 P. 156]; <em>People </em>v. <em>Kessler, </em>257 Cal.App.2d 812, 815 [65 Cal.Rptr. 248]; <em>People </em>v. <em>Jack, </em>233 Cal.App.2d 446, 458-459 [43 Cal.Rptr. 566].)</p>\n<p id=\"b383-5\">Defendants also request that this court \u201creevaluate the efficacy of the flight instruction,\u201d and they point to matters such as a statement in <em>Wong Sun </em>v. <em>United States, </em>371 U.S. 471, 483, footnote 10 [9 L.Ed.2d 441, 452, 83 S.Ct. 407], questioning the probative value of evidence of flight. Penal Cede section 1127c, however, makes mandatory the giving of an instruction on flight where evidence of a defendant\u2019s flight is relied upon as tending to show guilt,<footnotemark>5</footnotemark> and the giving of such an instruction in appropriate cases repeatedly has been approved. (E.g., <em>People </em>v. <em>Hutchinson, supra, </em>71 Cal.2d 342, 346; <em>People </em>v. <em>Hill, </em>67 Cal.2d 105, 119-120 [60 Cal.Rptr. 234, 429 P.2d 586]; <em>People </em>v. <em>Jordan, </em>45 Cal.2d 697, 706 [290 P.2d 484]; <em>People </em>v. <em>Chessman, </em>38 Cal.2d 166, 184 [238 P.2d 1001] [overruled on a different issue in <em>People </em>v. <em>Daniels, </em>71 Cal.2d 1119, 1139 <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"392\">*392</page-number>(80 Cal.Rptr. 897, 459 P.2d 225)]; see generally Witkin, Cal. Evidence (2d ed. 1966) p. 481.)</p>\n<p id=\"b384-4\">Defendants further argue that, although an instruction on flight may be proper under some circumstances it should not be given where, as here, the defense is justification since the instruction assertedly assumes justification was not proved. However, by its terms the instruction does not so assume. (See fn. 4 herein.) With respect to a similar instruction on flight, <em>People </em>v. <em>Daener, </em>96 Cal.App.2d 827, 832-833 [216 P.2d 511], pointed out that the instruction \u201cassumed neither the guilt nor flight of the defendant.\u201d</p>\n<p id=\"b384-5\">V. <em>Asserted Misreading of Instruction</em></p>\n<p id=\"b384-6\">From the reporter\u2019s transcript it appears that the court gave an instruction concerning provocation that began: \u201cWhen an assault, in a <em>case </em>such as this, is committed in a heat of passion . . . .\u201d<footnotemark>6</footnotemark> (Italics added.) The'word \u201ccharge\u201d was used in the instruction as requested instead of the italicized word, and defendants assert that as a result of \u201ctire inadvertent change\u201d in language it could be inferred from the instruction as given that the prosecution had made out its case of assault. However, the instructions as a whole made it clear that whether there was an assault was one of the issues for the jury to decide, and the trial judge specifically told the jury, \u201cI have not intended by anything I have said ... to intimate or suggest what you should find to be the facts . . . and if anything I have . . . said has seemed to so indicate, you will disregard that intimation and form your own opinion without regard thereto.\u201d</p>\n<p id=\"b384-7\">The judgment entered against Cannady is modified to provide a punishment of life imprisonment instead of death and as so modified is affirmed.
