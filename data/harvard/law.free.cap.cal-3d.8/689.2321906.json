(Noble Manors) and A. Anthony Kuri (Kuri) and from an order granting a new trial in favor of defendant Los Angeles County Flood Control District (District).</p>\n<p id=\"b672-12\">In, 1962, William and Aimee Miller purchased a home on Country Club Drive, within the Sunset Canyon area of the City of Burbank. The home had been built in 1959 by Noble Manors, a corporation responsible for the construction of several houses on the same street.</p>\n<p id=\"b672-13\">The City of Burbank maintained Country Club Drive both as a passageway for vehicular traffic and, in times of heavy rain, as a flood control channel. For the latter purpose, the street was designed with 18-inch curbs <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"693\">*693</page-number>in order to contain the rainwater that ran through the canyon to the valley below. The Miller home was situated at a 90-degree curve in this street, so that it lay in a direct line with the natural water runoff. At the head of Country Club Drive, defendant District owned and maintained a flood control structure known as the Upper Debris Basin. This dam-like structure, built by the District in 1929 after approval of plans by the Los Angeles County Board of Supervisors, was designed to collect mud and debris which, in times of flood, might endanger lives and property in the city below.</p>\n<p id=\"b673-4\">Several events occurring in the early 1960\u2019s served to focus attention on the flood dangers in this area. In February 1962, just prior to the Millers' acquisition of their home, floodwaters from the canyon destroyed another home located below plaintiffs\u2019 residence on Country Club Drive. In March 1964, a fire substantially denuded the hills above the dam, increasing the flood danger during the upcoming rainy season. The following September, the Public Works Director of the City of Burbank notified the District in a letter that, due to this danger, \"it would appear that every effort should be taken to have all debris basins completely empty prior to the approaching rainy season.\u201d The District began cleanout operations in late October or early November, and claimed to have completed them by November 9, the date of the accident. However, plaintiffs\u2019 witnesses testified that, two days prior to the flood, they had viewed the basin and found that it still contained a substantial amount of mud.</p>\n<p id=\"b673-5\">On the morning of November 9, 1964, a rainstorm quickly filled the Upper Debris Basin. A wall of water, mud and debris overflowed, traveling down the canyon to the curve in the street where the Miller home was located. It overran the curbs, smashed through plaintiffs\u2019 property and demolished the house. Mr. and Mrs. Miller were carried off by the torrent; he was subsequently saved, after suffering serious injuries, but Mrs. Miller drowned. Their daughter narrowly escaped the flood but thereafter suffered psychological injuries attributed to the accident.</p>\n<p id=\"b673-6\">Plaintiffs brought the present action for personal injuries, property damage and wrongful death, asserting liability of defendants as follows: Noble Manors and its president, Kuri, for alleged negligence in the design and construction of the home; the City of Burbank (City), for negligent design of the street and failure to guard against flood; the County of Los Angeles (County), for failing to remedy dangerous flood conditions on County-owned property in the hills: and the District, for negligent creation and maintenance of the debris dam. The complaint also alleged that City, County and the District negligently failed to warn residents of the flood danger.</p>\n<p id=\"b674-4\"><page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"694\">*694</page-number>The cause was tried to a jury. After the presentation of plaintiffs\u2019 evidence, the trial court granted a nonsuit in favor of defendants Noble Manors and Kuri on the ground that the evidence did not establish a prima facie showing of negligence. The trial proceeded against the other defendants and the jury returned a verdict awarding the sum of $128,940.20 to plaintiffs against the City and the District, but exonerating the County. The court, however, granted the City\u2019s motions for judgment notwithstanding the verdict and for a new trial; it also granted the District\u2019s motion for a new trial, but denied the District\u2019s motion for a judgment notwithstanding the verdict.</p>\n<p id=\"b674-5\">Plaintiffs appealed from the rulings favoring the City, the District, Noble Manors and Kuri. However, they subsequently entered into a compromise settlement with the City and have dismissed their appeal from the judgment notwithstanding the verdict in favor of the City. Thus, we are concerned at this point only with plaintiffs\u2019 appeal from the order granting a new trial as to the District, and from the judgment of nonsuit entered in favor of defendants Noble Manors and Kuri.</p>\n<p id=\"b674-6\">I</p>\n<p id=\"b674-7\">We turn first to plaintiffs\u2019 attacks upon the order granting the District a new trial. Our consideration of this issue requires some preliminary observations.</p>\n<p id=\"b674-8\">Plaintiffs asserted liability of the District on the following theory of case: that the District owned and maintained the debris basin; that such property was in a dangerous condition and hazardous to property downstream because the debris basin was inadequate; that the District maintained such property with full knowledge of the hazards, negligently failed to remedy the dangerous and defective conditions and negligently failed to provide adequate warning of them. Essentially, plaintiffs\u2019 theory of case was bottomed on section 835 of the Government Code.<footnotemark>2</footnotemark> In response the District denied any negligence and in addition asserted as an affirmative defense that it was immune from liability by reason of the provisions of sections <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"695\">*695</page-number>830.6,<footnotemark>3</footnotemark> 831,<footnotemark>4</footnotemark> 831.2<footnotemark>5</footnotemark> and 835.4<footnotemark>6</footnotemark> of the Government Code. The trial court instructed, the jury as to the liability of the District for a dangerous condition of public property substantially in accordance with Government Code sections 835 and 835.4 and that the District was immune from liability for injury caused by the design of the debris dam substantially in accordance with Government Code section 830.6. The court\u2019s instruction requested by defendant reads: \u201cDefendant Los Angeles County Flood Control District may be liable only if you find that the upper Sunset Canyon debris dam was in a dangerous condition on November 9, 1964, due to <em>maintenance. </em>Such liability may not be founded solely on the design <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"696\">*696</page-number>capacity of the dam, its location in the canyon, the design of the trash rack, or the fact that the dam was not designed to retain water.\u201d (Italics added.)</p>\n<p id=\"b676-5\">As previously noted, the jury returned a verdict in favor of plaintiffs and against the City of Burbank and the Los Angeles County Flood Control District for damages aggregating $128,940.20. Judgment was entered on the verdict.</p>\n<p id=\"b676-6\">Thereafter the court denied the District\u2019s motion for a judgment notwithstanding the verdict but granted its motion for a new trial upon the sole ground of insufficiency of evidence. This appeal.by plaintiffs followed.<footnotemark>7</footnotemark></p>\n<p id=\"b676-7\">In its order granting new trial, the court stated, \u201cReasons for granting the new trial to the District include the following: the only basis on which the District could be held liable to the plaintiffs under the facts of this case would relate to some condition of danger in the debris basin or dam creating it; the District is immune from any liability having to do with its design; the District completely and adequately discharged any obligation it had in the maintenance of the basin and dam as demonstrated by the overwhelming preponderance of the evidence.\u201d</p>\n<p id=\"b676-8\">Plaintiffs argue that this specification of reasons fails to comply with Code of Civil Procedure section 657, as interpreted by this court in <em>Mercer </em>v. <em>Perez </em>(1968) 68 Cal.2d 104 [65 Cal.Rptr. 315, 436 P.2d 315], and <em>Scala </em>v. <em>Jerry Witt &amp; Sons, Inc. </em>(1970) 3 Cal.3d 359 [90 Cal.Rptr. 592, 475 P.2d 864]. We agree.</p>\n<p id=\"b676-9\">Code of Civil Procedure section 657 provides in pertinent part: \u201cWhen a new trial is granted, on all or part of the issues, <em>the court shall specify the ground or grounds upon which it is granted and the court\u2019s reason or reasons for granting the new trial upon each ground stated.</em></p>\n<p id=\"b676-10\">\u201c. . . on appeal from an order granting a new trial upon the ground of the insufficiency of the evidence to justify the verdict <em>..., it shall be conclusively presumed that said order ms to such ground was made only for the reasons specified in said order </em>. . . .\u201d (Italics added.)</p>\n<p id=\"b676-11\">In <em>Mercer, </em>we interpreted this requirement to mean that \u201cthe judge must briefly recite the <em>respects </em>in which he finds the evidence to be legally inadequate; no other construction is consonant with the conclusive presumption <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"697\">*697</page-number>on appeal that the order was made \u2018only for the reasons specified.\u2019 Phrasing the requirement in terms of the codification of the trial judge\u2019s power in the second paragraph of the amendments [to \u00a7 657] . . . , such an order must <em>briefly identify the portion of the record </em>which convinces the judge \u2018that the court or jury should have reached a different verdict or decision.\u2019 \u201d (Fn. omitted.) <em>(Mercer </em>v. <em>Perez, supra, </em>68 Cal.2d at p. 116; italics added.) We explained that such a construction was required in order to serve the twofold purpose of the specification requirement: encouraging careful deliberation by the .trial court before ruling on a motion for new trial, and making a record sufficiently precise to permit meaningful appellate review. <em>(Id. </em>at pp. 112-115.)</p>\n<p id=\"b677-4\">In <em>Scala, </em>we explained more fully what we meant in requiring that an order \u201c <em>\u2018briefly identify the portion of the record ....\u2019\u201d (Scala </em>v. <em>Jerry Witt &amp; Sons, Inc., supra, </em>3 Cal.3d at p. 363; original italics.) We struck down the following new trial order which was made on the ground of insufficiency of the evidence: \u201c \u2018[T]here is no sufficient evidence to show that the defendant was negligent and the evidence does show that the plaintiff failed to use ordinary care for his own safety and that that failure was a proximate cause of his injuries.\u2019 \u201d <em>(Id. </em>at p. 363.) We observed that while <em>Mercer </em>did not require the trial judge to cite page and line of the record, it did require more than a mere reiteration of the ground itself. Accordingly, we emphasized in <em>Scala </em>that \u201c. . . a specification of reasons phrased, as here, in terms of such \u2018ultimate facts\u2019 as defendant\u2019s freedom from negligence and plaintiff\u2019s guilt of contributory negligence frustrates rather than promotes the legislative purpose of facilitating meaningful appellate review of the order granting a new trial, and hence is inadequate to comply with the mandate of . . . section 657.\u201d <em>(Id. </em>at pp. 369-370; fn. omitted.)</p>\n<p id=\"b677-5\">A further example of inadequate specification is found in <em>Van Zee </em>v. <em>Bayview Hardware Store </em>(1968) 268 Cal.App.2d 351 [74 Cal.Rptr. 21], cited with approval in <em>Scala. </em>In that case, the plaintiff sued for injuries caused by an allegedly defective aerosol paint can. After verdict for the plaintiff, the court granted the defendant a new trial. The ground of insufficiency of the evidence was supported by the following specification of reasons: \u201c \u2018[T]he evidence is insufficient to support the verdict in that the evidence does not establish that the Zynolyte aerosol paint can was defective at any time prior to the delivery of said can to the possession of the Plaintiff.\u2019\u201d <em>(Id. </em>at p. 358.) The Court of Appeal reversed the order granting a new trial, holding the specification of reasons to be inadequate, since it merely stated the failure to prove the ultimate fact in the case. \u201c[W]here the ground is insufficiency of the evidence, the purposes <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"698\">*698</page-number>of the statute frequently can be satisfied only if the reviewing court and the parties to the action are given more than a statement which declares that they have failed to prove the ultimate fact which they were required to establish.\u201d <em>(Id. </em>at p. 360.)</p>\n<p id=\"b678-5\">Turning to the case before us, we find the reasons stated in the order granting a new trial to be no more specific than those given in <em>Scala </em>or <em>Van Zee. </em>At the outset it is manifest that only the last clause of the above-quoted specification actually purports to state a reason. The first two clauses, echoing the trial court\u2019s instruction on design immunity (see text following fn. 6, <em>ante), </em>point out merely that the basis of the District\u2019s liability must be the maintenance as distinguished from the design of the dam.. The statement in the last clause that \u201cthe District completely and adequately discharged any obligation it had in the maintenance of the basin and dam as demonstrated by the overwhelming preponderance of the evidence\u201d is simply another way of saying that plaintiffs failed to prove the ultimate fact which they were required to establish. This \u201creason\u201d fails to identify which aspects of the evidence convinced the trial judge that the District had properly discharged its duty of maintenance.</p>\n<p id=\"b678-6\">For example, the trial judge may have believed the testimony of the District\u2019s employees that the debris basin had been cleaned out by the date of the accident. If so, review could have focused on the adequacy of that testimony. Alternately, the judge may have disbelieved plaintiffs\u2019 witnesses, a pair of young boys who allegedly viewed the basin two days before the accident and found it filled with mud. If that was the basis for the judge\u2019s reasoning, then it should have been stated, along with the reasons for disbelieving or otherwise rejecting the boys\u2019 testimony.<footnotemark>8</footnotemark> Finally, the trial court may have determined that the District, by sending a crew <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"699\">*699</page-number>of men to clean out the basin, had done all that was reasonably necessary to maintain it, and that the fact that such work was not completed by the date of the accident did not negate the reasonableness of the District\u2019s action. (See Gov. Code, \u00a7 835.4, subd. (b).) A statement to this effect would have drawn attention to the testimony relating to the efforts of the District\u2019s maintenance crew and the notice to the District of the imminent danger of flood.</p>\n<p id=\"b679-4\">Since \u201cit shall be conclusively presumed that said [new trial] order as to such ground was made only for the reasons specified\u201d (Code Civ. Proc., \u00a7 657), and the ground of insufficiency of the evidence is unsupported by a proper specification of reasons, we conclude that the order granting a new trial must be reversed. Consequently the judgment in favor of plaintiffs and against the District will be automatically reinstated. <em>(Mercer </em>v. <em>Perez, supra, </em>68 Cal.2d at pp. 118-124.)  As previously pointed out, we are presented with no cross-appeal by the District from such judgment. Its finality, therefore, upon reinstatement will automatically follow.</p>\n<p id=\"b679-5\">II</p>\n<p id=\"b679-6\">We turn now to consider plaintiffs\u2019 appeal from the judgment of nonsuit in favor of Noble Manors, the firm that built the Miller home,<footnotemark>9</footnotemark> In reviewing the judgment, we are careful to apply longstanding rules governing nonsuits which require us to view the evidence in the light most favorable to the plaintiffs and to disregard conflicting evidence on behalf of defendant.  Only if, after indulging in every legitimate inference favorable to plaintiffs, we find that there is no evidence of sufficient substantiality to support a verdict in plaintiffs\u2019 favor, can we uphold the judgment of nonsuit. <em>(Stanford </em>v. <em>City of Ontario </em>(1972) 6 Cal.3d 870, 874, fn. 1 [101 Cal.Rptr. 97, 495 P.2d 425]; <em>Estate of Callahan </em>(1967) 67 Cal.2d 609, 612 [63 Cal.Rptr. 277, 432 P.2d 965].)</p>\n<p id=\"b679-7\">Plaintiffs argue that the evidence presented to the trial court was sufficient to support a verdict in their favor on two theories: (1) That Noble Manors was negligent in constructing the home and this negligence caused plaintiffs\u2019 injuries; and (2) that Noble Manors should be held strictly liable for plaintiffs\u2019 injuries caused by the defective condition of the house.</p>\n<p id=\"b679-8\">Plaintiffs\u2019 theory of negligence alleges failure of Noble Manors, through its president, Kuri, to take reasonable steps to guard against destruction <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"700\">*700</page-number>of the home in case of flood. Plaintiffs called several witnesses to establish the allegedly faulty construction.<footnotemark>10</footnotemark> William Bush, a former right-of-way appraiser for the City of Burbank, testified that, considering the location of the Miller home, the potential danger of flood would have reduced its market value. Mr. O\u2019Hanlon, the designer of the house, and Kuri both testified that they were aware that Country Club Drive was a natural drainage channel, yet neither took steps to guard against potential floods.</p>\n<p id=\"b680-5\">Plaintiffs\u2019 principal witness was Neil Stiver, a mechanical engineer with training in hydraulics and hydrology. Mr. Stiver was familiar with the characteristics of flooding in hillside areas, having gained experience by working for another flood control district. In addition, he had investigated the Miller lot in 1965 (after the flood) for another company in order to see if similar destruction could be prevented and the lot rebuilt.</p>\n<p id=\"b680-6\">Plaintiffs\u2019 counsel attempted to qualify Stiver as an expert on the reasonable construction practices of builders in the area.<footnotemark>11</footnotemark> Finally, after a lengthy attempt to lay the proper foundation, plaintiffs\u2019 counsel asked Stiver if he had an opinion as to whether a reasonably prudent builder in Southern California, taking into account the topography of the area and the location of the Miller home, would have utilized a retaining wall as a portion of the design for the structure. The trial court sustained an objection to the question oil the ground that Stiver was not qualified to render an expert opinion on the subject. At the same time, it granted Noble Manors\u2019 motion for nonsuit on the ground that \u201c[tjhere is no case here against the defendant, Noble Manors . . . .\u201d</p>\n<p id=\"b680-7\">Plaintiffs argue first that the trial court erred in failing to allow their expert witness to testify as to what a reasonable builder would have done under the circumstances. If this testimony were allowed, plaintiffs would have established a prima facie case against Noble Manors and the nonsuit would be improper.</p>\n<p id=\"b681-3\"><page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"701\">*701</page-number>We are unable to accept this argument. To determine that a .witness qualifies as an expert the judge must ascertain \u201cif he has special knowledge, skill, experience, training, or education sufficient to qualify him as an expert on the subject to which his testimony relates.\u201d (Evid. Code, \u00a7 720, subd. (a).)  As we said in <em>Huffman </em>v. <em>Lindquist </em>(1951) 37 Cal.2d 465, 476 [234 P.2d 34, 29 A.L.R.2d 485]: \u201cIt is for the trial court to determine, in the exercise of a sound discretion, the competency and qualification of an expert witness to give his opinion in evidence [citation], and its ruling will not be disturbed upon appeal unless a manifest abuse of that discretion is shown. [Citations.]\u201d (See also <em>Sinz </em>v. <em>Owens </em>(1949) 33 Cal.2d 749, 755-766 [205 P.2d 3, 8 A.L.R.2d 757].)</p>\n<p id=\"b681-5\">After reviewing the record in the instant case, we are unable to say that the trial court abused its discretion. At one point, Stiver testified that he had observed the construction of several hundred residential developments in hillside areas such as Sunset Canyon. Nevertheless, under examination by plaintiffs\u2019 counsel<footnotemark>12</footnotemark> he indicated no close involvement in the construction of homes and, indeed, an unfamiliarity with building practices. This supports the trial court\u2019s ruling that he was not qualified to express an opinion in response to counsel\u2019s question.</p>\n<p id=\"b681-6\">In a second, but related attack on the nonsuit, plaintiffs next argue that the trial court erred by requiring expert testimony as to the practices of builders in the area in order' to establish the proper standard of care applicable to Noble Manors. The record discloses that the trial judge granted the motion for nonsuit because plaintiffs had failed to present evidence as to this essential ingredient of their case.<footnotemark>13</footnotemark> Plaintiffs complain <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"702\">*702</page-number>that, by requiring expert testimony on this subject, the court erroneously applied a \u201cmalpractice\u201d standard to this case rather than a negligence standard. Under the latter standard, it is urged, the, court should have allowed the jury to determine from their,own common experience whether or not Noble Manors acted reasonably in failing to protect the home against flood.</p>\n<p id=\"b682-5\">In <em>People </em>v. <em>Cole </em>(1956) 47 Cal.2d 99, 103 [301 P.2d 854, 56 A.L.R.2d 1435], we stated that \u201cthe decisive consideration in determining the admissibility of expert opinion evidence is whether the subject of inquiry is one of such common knowledge that men of ordinary education could reach a conclusion as intelligently as the witness or whether, on the other hand, the matter is sufficiently beyond common experience that the opinion of an expert would assist the trier of fact.\u201d (See also <em>Kastner </em>v. <em>Los Angeles Metropolitan Transit Authority </em>(1965) 63 Cal.2d 52, 57 [45 Cal.Rptr. 129, 403 P.2d 385].<footnotemark>14</footnotemark> It is settled that \u201can expert opinion is not inadmissible merely because it coincides with an ultimate issue of fact.\u201d <em>(People </em>v. <em>Polk </em>(1964) 61 Cal.2d 217, 233 [37 Cal.Rptr. 753, 390 P.2d 641]; Evid. Code, \u00a7 805.)  If the matter in issue is one within the knowledge of experts <em>only </em>and not within the common knowledge of laymen, it is necessary for the plaintiff to introduce expert opinion evidence in order to establish a prima facie case. (See <em>Huffman </em>v. <em>Lindquist, supra, </em>37 Cal.2d at pp. 473, 474-475; <em>Lawless </em>v. <em>Calaway </em>(1944) 24 Cal.2d 81, 88-89 [147 P.2d 604]; <em>Truman </em>v. <em>Vargas </em>(1969) 275 Cal.App.2d 976, 982-983 [80 Cal.Rptr. 373].)</p>\n<p id=\"b682-7\">Applying the above principles to the instant case we are satisfied that it was not for nonexpert minds to determine whether Noble Manors failed to exercise due care in the construction of the home. Building homes is a complicated activity. The average layman has neither training nor experience in the construction industry and ordinarily cannot determine<footnotemark>15</footnotemark> <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"703\">*703</page-number>whether a particular building has been built with the requisite skill and in accordance with the standards prescribed by law or prevailing in the industry.  In the instant case, the issue as to whether or not the Miller home had been negligently constructed involved a multitude of subsidiary questions bearing not only upon the erection of the structure itself but also upon the location of the house on the particular lot, the elevation of the lot, the influence of the surrounding terrain, the possibility of run-offs and floods, and the existence of the debris dam. These were not questions which the jury could have resolved from their common experience and the trial judge properly concluded that the issue of the allegedly negligent construction of the Miller residence was one within the knowledge of experts only.<footnotemark>16</footnotemark></p>\n<p id=\"b683-4\">Plaintiffs failed to present any competent expert opinion evidence on this issue. As we have seen, the witness, Stiver, was never properly qualified as an expert. Mr. Bush stated merely that the danger of a flood would have reduced the value of the Miller property\u2014a point actually having no relevancy on the issue of negligence. It is noteworthy that when plaintiffs\u2019 efforts to examine Bush on construction practices were blocked by defendant\u2019s objections, plaintiffs conceded the point. Witnesses Kuri and O\u2019Hanlon, as builder and designer, respectively, of the Miller home, were presumably qualified to testify as to building practices in the area, but were not questioned on this point by plaintiffs\u2019 counsel  Thus, lacking the requisite expert testimony, plaintiffs failed to prove an essential element of their case\u2014the standard of care applicable to Noble Manors\u2014 and the nonsuit was proper as to the theory of negligence.</p>\n<p id=\"b683-5\">Nor did plaintiffs establish a prima facie case under the theory of strict liability for the allegedly defective design and construction of the home.  Strict liability in tort does not apply unless the product (in this case, the home) allegedly causing the injury was in a defective condition. <em>(Cronin </em>v. <em>J.B.E. Olson Corp. </em>(1972) 8 Cal.3d 121, 130 [104 Cal.Rptr. 433, 501 P.2d 1153]; <em>Greenman </em>v. <em>Yuba Power Products, Inc. </em>(1963) 59 Cal.2d 57, 62 [27 Cal.Rptr. 697, 377 P.2d 897, 13 A.L.R.3d <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"704\">*704</page-number>1049].)  The burden is upon the plaintiff to establish the defective condition of the product and to prove that the defect proximately caused plaintiff\u2019s injury. (Grinnell v. <em>Charles Pfizer &amp; Co. </em>(1969) 274 Cal.App.2d 424, 435 [79 Cal.Rptr. 369]; <em>Preston </em>v. <em>Up-right, Inc. </em>(1966) 243 Cal.App.2d 636, 639 [52 Cal.Rptr. 679].)</p>\n<p id=\"b684-6\">Plaintiffs failed to offer any competent evidence that the home was in a defective condition at the time of the flood. We have already explained that, since the jury could not determine from common experience whether Noble Manors had acted negligently, the- lack of admissible expert testimony on the standard of care dictated a nonsuit as to the theory of negligence. For the same reason, the jury was incapable of determining without the aid of expert testimony that the house was defective. As we have seen, plaintiffs presented no expert testimony whatsoever as to the existence of a defect in the house.<footnotemark>17</footnotemark></p>\n<p id=\"b684-7\">In sum, viewing the evidence in the light of the settled mies governing nonsuits, we are satisfied that plaintiffs failed to introduce sufficient evidence against defendants Noble Manors, Inc. and A. Anthony Kuri either on a theory of case based on negligence or on a theory of case based on strict liability in tort.

In denying District\u2019s motion for a judgment notwithstanding the verdict, the judge noted the weak testimony of plaintiffs\u2019 witnesses on whether the debris basin had been cleaned out. However, the statement of reasons for the new trial order makes no reference to any other portion of the order.</p>\n<p id=\"b678-8\">In <em>Mercer </em>v. <em>Perez, supra, </em>68 Cal.2d 104, we noted that prior to the 1965 amendments to section 657 (requiring a specification of reasons where none had existed before) an appellant \u201chad no way of knowing which, portions of the proof were deemed inadequate and required justification before the reviewing court. The latter, in turn . . . could find itself considering alleged insufficiences totally unrelated to those relied upon by the trial judge . . . .\u201d <em>(Id. </em>at p. 114.) The requirement that the judge specify his reasons was intended to correct that procedure. Yet, if the District\u2019s argument were accepted, an appellate court would be required to guess at other portions of the order that could conceivably be incorporated into the specification of reasons supporting the ground of insufficiency of the evidence. As the above excerpt from <em>Mercer </em>demonstrates, the amendments to section 657 were intended to preclude just this type of guesswork.</p>\n</footnote>\n<footnote label=\"9\">\n<p id=\"b679-9\">Although the trial court entered its judgment of nonsuit in favor of both Noble Manors and its president, Kuri, plaintiffs do not contend on appeal that the court erred in granting the nonsuit as to the latter.</p>\n</footnote>\n<footnote label=\"10\">\n<p id=\"b680-8\">Witnesses Bush, Kuri and O\u2019Hanlon were called by plaintiffs to testify as adverse witnesses under Evidence Code section 776. It has long been a rule in this state that, on appeal from a nonsuit rendered against them, plaintiffs may rely on that portion of testimony given under section 776 (and its predecessor, Code Civ. Proc., \u00a7 2055) which is favorable to them, and disregard that which is unfavorable. <em>(Anthony </em>v. <em>Hobbie </em>(1945) 25 Cal.2d 814, 818-819 [155 P.2d 826]; <em>Crowe </em>v. <em>McBride </em>(1944) 25 Cal.2d 318, 319 [153 P.2d 727].

I do not know what it is and the jury doesn\u2019t know what it is.\u201d</p>\n<p id=\"b681-14\">A review of the evidence and of the judge\u2019s remarks reveals that the nonsuit was <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"702\">*702</page-number>grounded solely upon the plaintiffs\u2019 failure to establish by expert testimony that the conduct of Noble Manors deviated from the standard of practice in the community. There is no indication that the court was dissatisfied with evidence presented by the plaintiffs as to the mediate facts in the case, such as the grade of the street or the position of the home. Thus, our discussion focuses on whether the court erroneously required expert testimony on the standard of care to be applied to Noble Manors.</p>\n</footnote>\n<footnote label=\"14\">\n<p id=\"b682-9\">This same rule was eventually codified in Evidence Code section 801: \u201cIf a witness is testifying as an expert, his testimony in the form of an opinion is limited to such an opinion as is: [(\u00a1] (a) Related to a subject that is sufficiently beyond common experience that the opinion of an expert would assist the trier of fact . . . .\u201d</p>\n</footnote>\n<footnote label=\"15\">\n<p id=\"b682-10\">We exclude from consideration those failures on the part of the builder which are so obvious, if not bizarre, that they present no problem in the determination of his negligence, as for example the installation of a fireplace without a chimney or of a second floor without any means of access to it.</p>\n</footnote>\n<footnote label=\"16\">\n<p id=\"b683-6\">Plaintiffs contend that <em>Sabella </em>v. <em>Wisler </em>(1963) 59 Cal.2d 21 [27 Cal.Rptr. 689, 377 P.2d 889], supports their argument that expert testimony should not have been required. The contention lacks merit. First, in <em>Sabella, </em>we did not discuss or even indicate whether expert testimony had been introduced. Second, in upholding the trial court\u2019s finding that the defendant-contractor was negligent, we noted the applicable standard of care to be that of \u201c \u2018reasonably prudent persons\u2019 <em>in his </em>[the contractor\u2019s] <em>position </em>. . . .\u201d <em>(Id. </em>at p. 25.) In short, we there found sufficient evidence that the defendant had failed to exercise the care of a reasonable contractor.</p>\n</footnote>\n<footnote label=\"17\">\n<p id=\"b684-9\">Plaintiffs rely upon <em>Avner </em>v. <em>Longridge Estates </em>(1969) 272 Cal.App.2d 607 [77 Cal.Rptr. 633], and <em>Kriegler </em>v. <em>Eichler Homes, Inc. </em>(1969) 269 Cal.App.2d 224 [74 Cal.Rptr. 749], to support their establishment of a prima facie case on strict liability. While both cases involved the construction of homes (defendant in <em>Avner </em>was a \u201cmanufacturer of lots\u201d in hillside residential development areas), they are distinguishable from the instant one. In <em>Kriegler, </em>there was sufficient evidence that the heating system was defective. <em>(Kriegler </em>v. <em>Eichler Homes, Inc., supra, </em>269 Cal.App.2d at p. 226.) In <em>Avner, </em>the trial court had dismissed, without leave to amend, plaintiffs\u2019 cause of action for strict liability on the ground that \u201c \u2018there is no doctrine of strict liability as to the manufacture of residential lots.\u2019 \u201d <em>(Avner </em>v. <em>Longridge Estates, supra, </em>272 Cal.App.2d at p. 609.)
