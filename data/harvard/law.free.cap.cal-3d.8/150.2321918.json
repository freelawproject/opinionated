Applying this underlying formula, which the cases express, we hold that the Workmen\u2019s Compensation Act covers the injury incurred here and that petitioner should receive the benefits provided by the act.</p>\n<p id=\"b144-4\">The facts may be briefly summarized. Petitioner\u2019s employer, W. W. Wiest, an operator of seven or eight non-contiguous ranches, employed Miguel Hinojosa as a farm laborer, for thinning and picking peaches, plums, and apricots on his ranches. Upon completion of the work at one ranch, the foreman followed the practice of directing and assigning the workers to a different ranch. Hinojosa worked at this job nine to nine and one-half hours per day, six days a week, and received in payment $1.75 per hour. Like the other laborers, Hinojosa\u2019s payment started from the time he arrived at the job and continued until he departed for home, including the time spent in transit between the various Wiest ranches.</p>\n<p id=\"b144-5\">The workers, including petitioner, were required to provide their own private vehicles between the fields. The referee specifically found that \u201cthe nature of the work made it necessary for an employee to have transportation during the work day as the employer shifted him from one ranch to another.\u201d<footnotemark>1</footnotemark> Hinojosa did not know from day to day on which of his employer\u2019s fields he would be working or the duration of the work on that field; he needed a motor vehicle not only to get to the fields but for the variable inter-ranch transit necessary to perform the day\u2019s work. Thus the working conditions imposed by the employer required that Hinojosa provide himself with some form of automotive transportation.</p>\n<p id=\"b144-6\">Hinojosa did arrange for such transportation. Not owning a car of his own, he entered into an agreement to ride with a fellow worker, Raphael <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"153\">*153</page-number>Rodriguez, both to and from work and between the farms during the day. In return, Hinojosa paid Rodriguez $3 per week to share the operating costs of the automobile.</p>\n<p id=\"b145-3\">On June 8, 1970, petitioner finished his work on Wiest\u2019s \u201cairport ranch,\u201d the location to which he was instructed to return the following morning. He left the ranch in Rodriguez\u2019s vehicle, and was enroute home, when the car in which he was riding collided with another, causing him the injuries for which he seeks workmen\u2019s compensation benefits.<footnotemark>2</footnotemark></p>\n<p id=\"b145-4\">Following a hearing in January 1971, the referee found that the injury to petitioner arose out of and in the course of his employment and awarded compensation. The appeals board, however, vacated the award on the ground that the \u201cgoing and coming rule\u201d barred the claim and that Hinojosa\u2019s injury was therefore noncompensable. The board rejected the argument of the referee that <em>Smith </em>v. <em>Workmen's Comp. App. Bd. </em>(1968) 69 Cal.2d 814 [73 Cal.Rptr. 253, 447 P.2d 365] afforded controlling authority, noting that although the referee found that the employer required the employees to provide their own transportation on the job, Hinojosa was only a passenger, not the owner, of the car in which he sustained injury. Consequently, the board concluded that the <em>Smith </em>\u201cexception\u201d to the \u201cgoing and coming rule\u201d should not be applied to the case.</p>\n<p id=\"b145-5\">The question of whether petitioner should obtain compensation therefore turns on the relevance of the so-called \u201cgoing and coming rule\u201d to the circumstances surrounding his injury. In considering that question, a review of the development of that doctrine will illumine its claimed applicability.</p>\n<p id=\"b145-6\">Unlike a number of states,<footnotemark>3</footnotemark> California\u2019s \u201cgoing and coming rule\u201d is not a legislatively enacted limitation, but wholly a judicially created one. <em>(Zenith Nat. Ins. Co. </em>v. <em>Workmen's Comp. App. Bd. </em>(1967) 66 Cal.2d 944, 946 [59 Cal.Rptr. 622, 428 P.2d 606].) Historically the doctrine appears to have received its first judicial recognition in California in <em>Ocean </em><page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"154\">*154</page-number><em>Accident &amp; Guarantee Co. </em>v. <em>Ind. Acc. Com. </em>(1916) 173 Cal. 313 [159 P. 1041]. In deciding the issue of compensability for the death of a ship-worker who fell into the bay on the way to his vessel and drowned, the court noted that the California Workmen\u2019s Compensation Act of 1913 (Stats. 1913, ch. 176, p. 279) was modeled after the 1897 English act (Workmen's Compensation Act, 1897, 60 &amp; 61 Vict. ch. 37).</p>\n<p id=\"b146-4\">Discussing at length the English cases on the issue, the court concluded that \u201cthe governing principles of all the decisions ... is that . . . there are excluded from the benefits of the act all those accidental injuries which occur while the employee is going to or returning from his work.\u201d <em>(Id., </em>at pp. 321-322.) The reason for this limitation, the court declared, lay in the fact that, while travel to and from work grew out of, and was incidental to the employment, an employee going to and from his place of employment was not, pursuant to the requirement of the statute, rendering any <em>service </em>to the employer at the time of the accident. Therefore, the court held, such injuries fell outside the scope of the compensation act\u2019s coverage.<footnotemark>4</footnotemark></p>\n<p id=\"b146-5\">In the years immediately following the decision in <em>Ocean Accident, </em>the courts soon realized that the principle announced in that case did not universally apply. In fact, only three years after the decision, the court in <em>Judson Mfg. Co. </em>v. <em>Ind. Acc. Com. </em>(1919) 181 Cal. 300, 303 [184 P. 1], disapproved of \u201cthis sweeping <em>dictum . . . </em>not necessary to the decision of the case,\u201d in <em>Ocean Accident, </em>\u201cthat all those accidental injuries which occur while the employee is going to or returning from his work are excluded from the benefits of the act.\u201d The court in <em>Judson </em>cautioned against laying down any such absolute dictate, advising instead that the courts should consider each set of facts in light of the words of the statute.</p>\n<p id=\"b146-6\">Similarly, in granting compensation to a newspaper boy injured on his way home after delivering his papers, the court in <em>Makins </em>v. <em>Ind. Acc. Com. </em>(1926) 198 Cal. 698, 703 [247 P. 202, 49 A.L.R. 411], rejected <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"155\">*155</page-number>the petitioner\u2019s contention that the \u201cgoing and coming rule\u201d precluded the award. \u201cEach case,\u201d said the court, \u201cmust be adjudged by the facts which are peculiarly its own. Industrial accidents are produced by so many varying circumstances that it is rather unusual to find any two or more cases that may be ruled by the same legal precedent.\u201d</p>\n<p id=\"b147-4\">Despite references, such as the one in <em>Dellepiani </em>v. <em>Ind. Acc. Com. </em>(1931) 211 Cal. 430, 439 [295 P. 826], to \u201cthe \u2018coming and going rule\u2019 as announced by the court in the case of the <em>Ocean Accident . . . </em>,\u201d the court in subsequent years continued to recognize that the \u201crule\u201d was \u201csubject to many exceptions,\u201d and that each case should be adjudged on its own unique facts. <em>(Enterprise Foundry Co. </em>v. <em>Ind. Acc. Com. </em>(1929) 206 Cal. 562, 565 [275 P. 432].) Justice Shenk\u2019s dissent in the <em>Enterprise Foundry </em>case also marked the first judicial recognition of the relevance of the liberal construction clause of the Workmen\u2019s Compensation Act to the issue. <em>(Id., </em>at p. 570.) A growing awareness developed that the beneficent aims of the act could simply not be served by an inflexible judicial fiat which barred compensation for all injuries received going to or coming from work.</p>\n<p id=\"b147-5\">By 1942, Justice Traynor, speaking for a unanimous court in <em>Cal. Cas. Indem. Exch. </em>v. <em>Ind. Acc. Com. </em>(1942) 21 Cal.2d 461 [132 P.2d 815], discarded the requirement on which the rationale of the \u201cgoing and coming rule\u201d established in <em>Ocean Accident </em>had rested\u2014that the employee must, at the time of the injury, be performing service to the employer to be eligible for compensation. In granting compensation to a stenographer injured in an automobile accident in a company car on her way home from work, the court commented, \u201cPetitioner contends that the applicant was not acting within the course of her employment at the time of her injury because she was not performing any service growing out of or incidental to her employment. It is not indispensable to recovery, however, that the employee be rendering service to his employer at the time of the injury.\u201d <em>(Id., </em>at p. 465.)</p>\n<p id=\"b147-6\">In a namesake case a year later, <em>Cal. Cas. Ind. Exch. </em>v. <em>Ind. Acc. Com. </em>(1943) 21 Cal.2d 751 [135 P.2d 158], the court recognized that since the rendition of the <em>Ocean Accident </em>case, the exceptions to the going and coming doctrine had been \u201cconsiderably broadened\u201d and the \u201crule\u201d was \u201cnot of inevitable application.\u201d Nevertheless, the court noted that the \u201crule\u201d still presented difficulty in borderline cases of determining whether or not an employee was within the purview of the compensation act. \u201cIn view of this state\u2019s policy of liberal construction in favor of the employee,\u201d a unanimous court held, any reasonable doubt as to the applicability of <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"156\">*156</page-number>the going and coming doctrine must be resolved in the employee\u2019s favor. <em>(Id., </em>at pp. 756-760; accord, <em>Dimmig </em>v. <em>Workmen's Comp. Appeals Bd. </em>(1972) 6 Cal.3d 860, 867 [101 Cal.Rptr. 105, 495 P.2d 433]; <em>Garzoli </em>v. <em>Workmen's Comp. App. Bd. </em>(1970) 2 Cal.3d 502, 505 [86 Cal.Rptr. 1, 467 P.2d 833].)</p>\n<p id=\"b148-4\">Thus the so-called going and coming rule composes no formula of automatic application. We have explained that \u201cthis rule . . . has long been recognized [to be] \u2018subject to many exceptions\u2019 [citing cases]. Indeed, one writer in the field of workmen\u2019s compensation has suggested that the exceptions have swallowed the rule. (See Horowitz, Note, 14 NACCA L.J. 36.)\u201d <em>(Schreifer v. Industrial Acc. Com. </em>(1964) 61 Cal.2d 289, 291 [38 Cal.Rptr. 352, 391 P.2d 832].) No less an authority than Dean Pound urged in 1954, \u201cA rule which has developed at least six recognized exceptions since it was announced in England in 1908 is evidently, if not moribund, deserving of overhauling as a whole.\u201d (Pound, <em>Current Articles of Special Interest: Workmen's Compensation </em>(1954) 14 NACCA L.J. 394, 400.) Commentators have severely criticized it.<footnotemark>5</footnotemark></p>\n<p id=\"b148-5\">The New Hampshire Supreme Court, noting that, \u201cthe so-called \u2018rule\u2019 has proved to be of doubtful utility and is riddled with various exceptions,\u201d repudiated it in <em>Brousseau </em>v. <em>Blackstone Mills </em>(1957) 100 N.H. 493, 494-495 [130 A.2d 543, 545]: \u201c. . . [W]e do not regard the going-and-coming rule as either necessary or particularly useful in deciding coverage under the Workmen\u2019s Compensation Law.\u201d</p>\n<p id=\"b148-6\">The tortuous history of the \u201crale,\u201d indeed, writes more than an essay in abstraction; it is rather the record of a raw issue. We believe that two conflicting interests generated the present tension. The interest of the employer lies in his desire to be immune from liability for the employee\u2019s injury or death that occurs in the everyday transit from home to office or plant; the <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"157\">*157</page-number>contrary interest of the employee lies in his desire to be protected from loss by injury or death that occurs in the non-routine transit, or results from the means of transit or the use of a car undertaken for the employer for his benefit at his direct or implied request. Although the basic idea of workmen\u2019s compensation conceives that the employee should be protected against work-incurred injury, the concept does not. extend to such a point that it would cover every injury suffered after the employee steps from his threshold bound for the office or plant. Workmen\u2019s compensation should not include- the injury incurred in the public bus on the way to work. On the other hand, as we have set forth above, a multitude of situations clearly call for protection of the employee.</p>\n<p id=\"b149-4\">We think a careful analysis of the decisions will develop the formula that reconciles the divergent positions. The cases have suggested a sensible line under workmen\u2019s compensation between the extremes of absolute coverage and absolute rejection for all transit-suffered injuries. In substance the courts have held non-compensable the injury that occurs during a local commute enroute to a fixed place of business at fixed hours in the absence of special or extraordinary circumstances. The decisions have thereby excluded the ordinary, local commute that marks the daily transit of the mass of workers to and from their jobs; the employment, there, plays no special role in the requisites of portage except the normal need of the presence of the person for the performance of the work.</p>\n<p id=\"b149-5\">On the other hand, many situations do not involve local commutes en-route to fixed places of business at fixed hours. These are the extraordinary transits that vary from the norm because the employer requires a special, different transit, means of transit, or use of a car, for some particular reason of his own. When the employer gains that kind of a particular advantage, the job does more than call for routine transport to it; it plays a different role, bestowing a special benefit upon the employer by reason of the extraordinary circumstances. The employer\u2019s special request, his imposition of an unusual condition, removes the transit from the employee\u2019s choice or convenience and places it within the ambit of the employer\u2019s choice or convenience, restoring the employer-employee relationship.</p>\n<p id=\"b149-6\">We shall point out that the cases, distinguishing between the transits that are local commutes to fixed places of business at fixed hours and those that are not, hold injuries compensable that are incurred in transits that do fall into the second category.</p>\n<p id=\"b149-7\">Thus, drawing from the decisions arising under the workmen\u2019s compensation law and from those fixing the liability of the employer for the tort <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"158\">*158</page-number>of the employee that occurs in the course of employment, this court recently stated in <em>Hinman </em>v. <em>Westinghouse Elec. Co. </em>(1970) 2 Cal.3d 956, 962 [88 Cal.Rptr. 188, 471 P.2d 988], \u201cThe above cases indicate that exceptions will be made to the \u2018going and coming\u2019 rule where the trip involves an incidental benefit to the employer, not common to commute trips by ordinary members of the work force.\u201d Applying the same test, the court in <em>Huntsinger </em>v. <em>Glass Container Corp. </em>(1972) 22 Cal.App.3d 803, 810 [99 Cal.Rptr. 666], rejected defendant\u2019s contention that the employee\u2019s \u201ctrip from the office to- his house during which the accident occurred did not involve any incidental benefit to it not common to commute trips by ordinary members of its work force.\u201d The court expressed the basis of its ruling: \u201c. . . when a business enterprise requires an employee to drive to and from its office in order to have his vehicle available for company business during the day, accidents, on the way to or from the office are statistically certain to occur eventually, and the business enterprise having required the driving to and from work, the risk of such accidents are risks incident to the business enterprise.\u201d</p>\n<p id=\"b150-4\">This court, likewise, in <em>Zenith Nat. Ins. Co. </em>v. <em>Workmen's Comp. App. Bd. </em>(1967) 66 Cal.2d 944, 948 [59 Cal.Rptr. 622, 428 P.2d 606], drew the same line between the routine, local commute and the special situation. Relying on that distinction rather than the absence of either the employer\u2019s \u201ccontrol of the mode of transportation\u201d or compensation for travel time \u25a0\u2014tests improperly relied on in <em>Westinghouse Elec. Corp. </em>v. <em>Ind. Acc. Com. </em>(1966) 239 Cal.App.2d 533 [48 Cal.Rptr. 758]\u2014the court said: \u201cSince'the trip to the employer\u2019s premises involved no more than a local commute and the employer granted only a nominal allowance for carfare, the court could have concluded that no exceptions to the going and coming rule applied.\u201d (P. 948.)</p>\n<p id=\"b150-5\">The cases have distinguished between transit to' and from a fixed place of business at fixed hours and the special journey. Thus in <em>Le Febvre </em>v. <em>Workmen's Comp. App. Bd. </em>(1968) 69 Cal.2d 386 [71 Cal.Rptr. 703, 445 P.2d 319], the court annulled an award denying compensation for the death of a volunteer fireman while engaged in travel to a station \u2019where he was to attend a fire drill. We emphasized that the employee was required to respond to fires at any location and to attend\u2019drills at different stations; accordingly we concluded that the travel did \u201cnot fall within the going and coming rule, because he had no regular or normal place of employment as contemplated by that rule.\u201d (P. 388.)</p>\n<p id=\"b150-6\">The lack of fixed hours and the fact that \u201chis hours of work were irregular as compared with most jobs\u201d led the court in <em>Schreifer </em>v. <em>Indus</em><page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"159\">*159</page-number><em>trial Acc. Com. </em>(1964) 61 Cal.2d 289 [38 Cal.Rptr. 352, 391 P.2d 832] to hold that the going and coming rule did not apply and that the \u201cspecial mission\u201d exception governed. \u201cNearly every employment relationship contemplates that extraordinary needs may arise and must be met. \u2018Special\u2019 means extraordinary in relation to routine duties, not outside the scope of the employment.\u201d <em>(Id., </em>at p. 295.)</p>\n<p id=\"b151-4\">We now turn to cases that establish that the extraordinary, or, indeed \u201cspecial,\u201d situation does stand apart from the routine one. We allude to the situation in which the employer, because of benefit to himself, places an extraordinary requirement upon the employee, thereby re-establishing the employment relationship in the case of transit, and imposing liability on the employer in the case of the employee\u2019s injury. Thus the employer may designate a special authorized route to the job that entails benefit to the employer but hazard to the employee; the worker must submit to dangers that he otherwise would have the choice of avoiding; such travel is no routine commute, and injury in the course of it is compensable <em>(Judson Mfg. Co. </em>v. <em>Ind. Acc. Com. </em>(1919) 181 Cal. 300 [184 P. 1]; 1 Larson, The Law of Workmen's Compensation (1968) \u00a7 15.13). A similar legal consequence follows an employee\u2019s injury upon a road over which the employer exercises control <em>(Smith </em>v. <em>Industrial Acc. Com. </em>(1941) 18 Cal.2d 843 [118 P.2d 6]; 1 Larson, <em>supra, </em>\u00a7 15.43).</p>\n<p id=\"b151-5\">An obvious departure from the routine commute is the \u201cspecial mission\u201d in which the employee goes to or comes from a particular designated destination at the request or invitation of the employer. In <em>Dimmig </em>v. <em>Workmen's Comp. Appeals Bd. </em>(1972) 6 Cal.3d 860 [101 Cal.Rptr. 105, 495 P.2d 433], an employee attended night classes at the instance of his employer; we held that \u201cwhen the employee engages in a special activity which is within the course of his employment, and which is reasonably undertaken at the request or invitation of the employer, an injury suffered while traveling to and from the place of such activity is also within the course of employment and is compensable.\u201d We noted that \u201cThe school attendance was extraordinary in relation to Dimmig\u2019s routine duties at Memorex. In addition, Dimmig\u2019s travel to and from the college was not travel to and from his normal place of work at the normal hour.\u201d <em>(See Argonaut Ins. Co. </em>v. <em>Industrial Acc. Com. </em>(1963) 221 Cal.App.2d 140 [34 Cal.Rptr. 206]; <em>State Comp. Ins. Fund </em>v. <em>Ind. Acc. Com. </em>(1928) 89 Cal.App. 197 [264 P. 514]; 1 Larson, <em>supra, </em>\u00a7 16.10.) Clearly the workmen\u2019s compensation law likewise covers the injury if the employer makes substantial payments to the employee for his travel time to a distant location <em>(Zenith Nat. Ins. Co. </em>v. <em>Workmen's Comp. App. Bd. </em>(1967) 66 Cal.2d 944 [59 Cal.Rptr. 622, 428 P.2d 606]; <em>Kobe </em>v. <em>Industrial Acc. </em><page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"160\">*160</page-number><em>Com. </em>(1950) 35 Cal.2d 33 [215 P.2d 736]; 1 Larson, <em>supra, </em>\u00a7 16.20) or if the employer himself <em>provides </em>the transportation <em>(Harlan </em>v. <em>Ind. Acc. Com. </em>(1924) 194 Cal. 352 [228 P. 654]; 1 Larson, <em>supra, </em>\u00a7 17.10).</p>\n<p id=\"b152-4\">Finally, the situation which reflects the instant one is that in which the employee is expressly or impliedly required or expected to furnish his own means of transportation to the job <em>(Smith </em>v. <em>Workmen's Comp. App. Bd. </em>(1968) 69 Cal.2d 814 [73 Cal.Rptr. 253, 447 P.2d 365]). Larson states that in this instance: \u201c. . . the obligations of the job reach out beyond the premises, making the vehicle a mandatory part of the employment environment, and compel the employee to submit to the hazards associated with private motor travel, which otherwise he would have the option of avoiding. Since this is the theory, it is immaterial, whether the employee is compensated for the expenses of the trip.\u201d (1 Larson, The Law of Workmen's Compensation, <em>supra, </em>\u00a7 17.50.)</p>\n<p id=\"b152-5\">Once we have defined the different types of situations, once we have cut away the underbrush and seen the trunks of the principles, the decision is not difficult. Thus the instant case falls within the category of the extraordinary journey that varies from the norm because the employer for some special reason of his own requires a different transit, or means of transit or use of a car. The factual situation is well described by the referee in his opinion on decision and not disputed by the appeals board: \u201cIn the instant case, the nature of the work made it necessary for an employee to have transportation during the work day as the employer shifted him from one ranch to another. It is clearly and directly to the employer\u2019s benefit that the employees furnish this transportation, since he in no way provided it himself. The employer, in fact, acknowledged the benefit to himself by paying the employees\u2019 wages for the time of travel during the work day. M|] The requirement for furnishing transportation, while not express as in the <em>Smith </em>case, was clearly implied.\u201d</p>\n<p id=\"b152-6\">Indeed, we think the present case is controlled by the principle of <em>Smith. </em>There the employer \u201cinstructed Smith to have his car available on the job every morning\u201d (p. 821) so that \u201che could visit his clients on field days . . . and . . . would be available to see clients in cases of emergency on regular office days.\u201d (P. 816.) We held that the requirement that the employee furnish his means of transportation effected a resumption of the employment relationship. Smith suffered fatal injuries in an accident which occurred while he was en route from his home to his office. We said that the \u201crelationship resumes no less effectively when the employer requires that the employee engage in conduct, whether prior, to the workday or after it, whether on the premises of that employer or <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"161\">*161</page-number>away from them, that inures to the benefit of the employer. The employment relationship can hardly be severed during the performance of an act required by the employer for his own purposes and advantage, [f] In the instant case the employer clearly benefited from Smith\u2019s bringing the car to work.\u201d</p>\n<p id=\"b153-4\">We concluded that \u201cSurely in this day of a highly motorized society we cannot cast the going and coming rule as a protective cloak over the shoulders of the employer who, for his own advantage, demands that the employee furnish the car on the job. Smith\u2019s obligation reached out beyond the employer\u2019s premises, and, in driving his car to and from them, he did no more than fulfill the condition and requirement of his employment.\u201d The necessity for the use of a car to go from one to another of his clients in the case of the social worker in <em>Smith </em>is no different than the necessity for the use of a car to go from one to another of the employer\u2019s separate ranches in the instant case.<footnotemark>6</footnotemark></p>\n<p id=\"b153-5\">Although in the instant case the requirement for the car was implicit rather than express, the use of a vehicle can be \u201can implied or express condition of . . . employment.\u201d <em>(Huntsinger </em>v. <em>Glass Container Corp. </em>(1972) 22 Cal.App.3d 803, 809 [99 Cal.Rptr. 666].) The condition implicit in the employment itself dictated the use of car transport; no words of the employer were necessary; the situation, like res ipsa loquitur, spoke for itself. To get from one noncontiguous field to another within the work day <em>required </em>the use of automobile transport. Since the employer furnished no such private transport the employer in effect imposed the requirement that the employees themselves procure such transport in the form of cars driven to and from work each day to one of the seven or eight fields <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"162\">*162</page-number>designated by the foreman. The implied requirement here became as concrete a part of the contract of employment as the express requirement in <em>Smith.</em></p>\n<p id=\"b154-4\">The fact that petitioner did not <em>own </em>the automobile in which the accident occurred does not render the rationale of <em>Smith </em>inapplicable. So to hold would mean that petitioner\u2019s co-worker, Rodriguez, the driver of the vehicle, would be entitled to workmen\u2019s compensation benefits while petitioner would not. Yet both shared the burden and expense of providing the on-the-job vehicle necessary to their employment. Both equally performed the service to the employer of supplying an essential tool of the trade\u2014their own transportation between the various Wiest fields.</p>\n<p id=\"b154-5\">Two co-employees, injured in the same accident and under identical employment circumstances, cannot logically be treated differently under the workmen\u2019s compensation law merely because one is the legal owner of, and the other a passenger in, the vehicle involved in the accident. (Compare <em>Stumar </em>v. <em>Industrial Acc. Com. </em>(1936) 16 Cal.App.2d 429 [60 P.2d 557] with <em>Wiley </em>v. <em>Ind. Acc. Com. </em>(1936) 16 Cal.App.2d 756 [60 P.2d 558]; see also, 2 Hanna, Cal. Law of Employee Injuries and Workmen\u2019s Compensation, <em>supra, </em>\u00a7 9.03[1][c].) After noting the \u201cgoing and coming rule\u201d and its exceptions, Hanna comments, \u201cLikewise, injuries sustained in the vehicle of a fellow employee or third party may, <em>subject to the same rules, </em>be compensable.\u201d (Italics added.)</p>\n<p id=\"b154-6\">In conclusion, we hold that the instant case clearly differs from the normal routine commute; it is instead the extraordinary situation in which the job is structured, and dependent upon, transportation from one place of work to another so that the use of an instrument of such transportation is a requisite of employment. The employer could have provided, at his own expense, company vehicles to transport the workers between his various farms during their workday. His failure to do so made it necessary for the workers to supply their own on-the-job transportation. Thus petitioner made use of the car from Ms residence to the first ranch, and thereafter from ranch to ranch and finally from ranch to Ms residence because the car was an essential requirement of the job; the presence of the car was requisite to performance of the job; the worker was impliedly required to bring the car to the job and to take it from the job. Thus the injury suffered in the car was covered by the Workmen\u2019s Compensation Act.</p>\n<p id=\"b154-7\">The decision of the Workmen\u2019s Compensation Appeals Board is an<page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"163\">*163</page-number>nulled. The cause is remanded to that board for proceedings consistent with the views herein expressed.</p>\n<p id=\"b155-4\">Wright, C. J., McComb, J., Peters, J., Mosk, J., Burke, J., and Sullivan, J., concurred.</p>\n<footnote label=\"1\">\n<p id=\"b144-7\">Respondent-employer\u2019s contention, first raised in his answer to the brief of amicus curiae, that no evidence supports the proposition that he required his workers, either expressly or impliedly, to provide their own transportation for on-the-job use, thus conflicts with the referee\u2019s findings. Nor did the appeals board dispute this finding, but instead noted that \u201cthe referee in relying upon <em>Smith </em>v. <em>Workmen's Comp. App. Bd. </em>(1968) 69 Cal.2d 814 [73 Cal.Rptr. 253, 447 P.2d 365] states that the employer herein required the employee to have his car available on the job.\u201d The appeals board attempted to distinguish the <em>Smith </em>case on the ground that petitioner did not <em>own </em>the car in which the accident occurred.</p>\n<p id=\"b144-8\">The uncontradicted evidence, however, shows that travel between the employees various farms composed a necessary part of petitioner\u2019s employment and that his employer did not provide any transportation for such travel. Thus the finding by the referee that there was an implied requirement that the workers supply their own means of transportation is amply supported by the evidence.</p>\n</footnote>\n<footnote label=\"2\">\n<p id=\"b145-7\">Two other farmworkers, travelling in Rodriguez\u2019 automobile under similar arrangements, were killed in the collision. Death claims have been filed by their families and are now pending before the appeals board.

The California Workmen\u2019s Compensation Act in force at the time did contain a liberal construction clause, which declared simply that the act \u201cshall be liberally construed.\u201d (Stats. 1913, ch. 176, \u00a7 86, at p. 319.) The court in <em>Ocean Accident </em>took no note of that section. The year after that decision, however, the Legislature enacted a revised Workmen\u2019s Compensation Act which contained a much more explicit dictate to the courts, providing that the act \u201cshall be liberally construed . . . <em>with the purpose of extending the benefits of the act for the protection of persons injured in the course of their employment.\u201d </em>(Stats. 1917, ch. 586, \u00a7 69, at p. 877 (italics added).)

Not only have we reached the point, they argue, where the exceptions have obliterated the rule, but continuing to focus on the artificially perpetuated \u201crule\u201d and its categories of exceptions causes the board and the courts to lose sight of the primary statutory test of \u201cin the course of employment.\u201d</p>\n</footnote>\n<footnote label=\"6\">\n<p id=\"b153-6\">The decision in <em>Smith </em>accords with an impressive line of cases from other jurisdictions which have held that when the use of a private vehicle is an integral part of an employee\u2019s duties, an injury occurring while that vehicle is being transported to or from work occurs \u201cin the course of employment.\u201d (See, e.g., <em>State Department of Highways </em>v. <em>Johns </em>(Alaska 1967) 422 P.2d 855, fn. 22 at p. 861; <em>Pittsburgh Testing Laboratories </em>v. <em>Kiel </em>(1960) 130 Ind.App. 598 [167 N.E.2d 604]; <em>Davis </em>v. <em>Bjorenson </em>(1940) 229 Iowa 7 [293 N.W. 829]; <em>Willis </em>v. <em>Cloud </em>(La.App. 1963) 151 So.2d 379, affd. mem., 244 La. 623 [153 So.2d 415]; <em>Borak </em>v. <em>H.
