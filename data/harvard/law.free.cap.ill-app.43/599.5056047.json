It is-therefore unnecessary to set out the documentary evidence showing the constitution and by-laws of the association by which that duty is imposed. If he was in good standing, his death intestate, and that she is his widow, were the only things to be proved by parol, in order to show that the contingency upon which the duty arose had happened, and that she was the person to whom that duty was owing. This parol proof did not take the case out of the category of actions upon written contracts, the limitation of which is ten and not five years. Memory v. Niepert, 131 Ill. 623; 2 Taylor on Ev. 1015; Larned v. Johns, 9 Allen, 419.</p> <p id=\"b602-5\" pgmap=\"602\">This disposes of the first point argued by appellant. The next three points are in effect but one, viz.: That Loomis was not a member in good standing at the time he died. If the fact be so, the point is good, but the burden of proving it is \u25a0upon the appellant. The certificate is prima facie evidence to the contrary. One of the by-laws contains these words: \u201cMembers of this association neglecting or refusing to pay assessment for the period of thirty days from date of such assessment shall cease to be a member,\u201d etc. That this provision is self-executing, we think is true. Hansen v. Supreme Lodge, 40 Ill. App. 216.</p> <p id=\"b602-7\" pgmap=\"602\">But the proper construction of it is, that the thirty days begin to run only from the date that notice is given to the member, of the assessment.</p> <p id=\"b602-8\" pgmap=\"602\">The constitution and by-laws being silent on the subject of notice, and containing nothing dispensing with notice, the general rule of law governs, that notice is necessary where the act of one party gives rise to the duty of the other. The assessment, if made, was the act of the association. Before it can complain of neglect or refusal by a member to pay, he must be given notice. Chase v. S. &amp; C. R. R. Co., 38 Ill. 215. And wherever the law requiresnotiee, and does not describe the manner, it must be personal. Wachtel v. Noah, 34 N. Y. 28.</p> <p id=\"b602-9\" pgmap=\"602\">There is testimony tending to show that notice was mailed to Loomis in time to put him in default if he had received the notice, but nothing showing to any reasonable degree of certainty that he received it. A witness states that the notice was in an envelope with a receipt sent for a prior assessment; the appellee states that she received that receipt and no notice came with it. The appellant was unable to prove sufficiently, notice to Loomis, and is therefore without defense upon that point. He was, for aught this record shows, a member in good standing when he died. The last point relied upon is based upon a clause of the constitution relating to the board of directors, as follows:</p> <p id=\"b603-3\" pgmap=\"603\">\u201c They shall decide all points of dispute and questions of doubt that may arise, and their decision shall be final.\u201d</p> <p id=\"b603-4\" pgmap=\"603\">Preceding that is a clause, \u201c to them shall all claims against the association be referred, and upon the approval of a majority of said board, with that of the president, the same shall be paid by the secretary and treasurer.\u2019/ If these two clauses are to be read together, the power of the board extends to the rejection hut not to the allowance of claims. They may forbid, but can not direct, the opening of its treasury. We can not concur in the judgment of the United States Circuit Court of this district (Rood v. this appellant, 31 Fed. Rep. 62), that a beneficiary under a certificate issued by the association is dependent upon the will of the board, however honestly they may act, whether he or she shall be-paid. It may well be that among the members themselves the decision of the board they elected, upon questions affecting them, is final; but if a stranger had let rooms, sold furniture or supplied stationery to them, it would not he contended that they could defeat his claim for compensation. The death of Loomis severed his relations with the association. The appellee had no voice in it. Her interests were adverse to the interests of all the surviving members, though they might perhaps feel that the denial of her claim might be a bad precedent for their own beneficiaries. That an organization may be such that the obligations shall be purely mora!, without redress by law, may be; bub the language by which that result is effected must be more explicit than that which is quoted.</p> <p id=\"b603-5\" pgmap=\"603\">Whether the declaration is in the right form is a question not made below, where, if necessary, it might have been amended, and therefore it can not be made here. Citizens Gaslight Co. v. Granger, 118 Ill. 266.</p> <p id=\"b603-7\" pgmap=\"603\">It is unnecessary to review the pleadings, traveling off to sur-rejoinders, the twenty-one reasons assigned for a new trial and the twenty-nine errors assigned. We have in substance followed the argument in the brief of appellant.</p> <p id=\"b603-8\" pgmap=\"603\">The judgment of the Circuit Court .in favor of the appellee is affirmed.</p> <p id=\"b603-9\" pgmap=\"603\">Judgment affirmed.</p> </opinion> </casebody> ",
