A public road passes through Manown\u2019s farm to the edge of the Monongahela river. Chess owns the land on the opposite side, and keeps a ferry. Manown contends that Chess has no right to land his passengers at the end of the road terminating at low water mark on Manown\u2019s land.</summary>\n<summary data-order=\"4\" data-type=\"summary\" id=\"b219-8\">The court below charged the jury as follows (Shaler, president):</summary>\n<summary data-order=\"5\" data-type=\"summary\" id=\"b219-9\">\u201cThe landing complained of is admitted to have been on the shore between high and low water mark. To this point a public road has been laid out. The question submitted for the consideration of the court is, whether a ferry can be established from the land of A to the land of B on the opposite shore, to terminate at low water mark, and on a public road running down to low water line; and this is to be determined by the right of the party to the land adjoining on a navigable river and lying between high and low water mark. This question appears to have been already decided in Uberworth <em>v. </em>The Le-high and Schuylkill Navigation Company, in which Judge Huston, in reference to it, holds the following language ; \u2018 along all rivers, &amp;c.,\u2019 and ending with \u2018it. is better than that of any one else, but always subject to the superior right of the state.\u2019 If this be the law it establishes the right of the plaintiff to your verdict.\u201d</summary>\n<summary data-order=\"6\" data-type=\"summary\" id=\"b219-10\">Error was assigned to this charge.</summary>\n<attorneys data-order=\"7\" data-type=\"attorneys\" id=\"b219-11\"><em>Kingston </em>and <em>Forward, </em>for plaintiff in error.</attorneys>\n<attorneys data-order=\"8\" data-type=\"attorneys\" id=\"b219-12\"><em>Fetterman </em>and <em>Foster, </em>for defendant in error,</attorneys>\n<p data-order=\"9\" data-type=\"legal\" id=\"APa\">cited Chambers v.

The same principle was held in Chambers v. <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"220\">*220</page-number>Fury, 1 <em>Yeates </em>167, where it was determined that the dedication of ground to purposes of public use as a road, gives no right to use it for purposes of landing or receiving freight. Here the <em>locus in quo </em>was a <em>terminus </em>of a public highway on the margin of the river : and there was not even a public ferry to give colour to the pretence of a right to use the shore as 'a landing or wharf for the mooring of boats. The franchise of the public was to pass over the soil, and no more.</p>\n<p id=\"b220-6\">Judgment affirmed.</p>\n</opinion>\n</casebody>\n",
