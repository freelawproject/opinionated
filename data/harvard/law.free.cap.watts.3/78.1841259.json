On the 30th of December 1829,20 dollars of this judgment were assigned to George Watson and Walter Forward, attorneys for Thornburgh; and, on the 31st the balance, together with the plaintiff\u2019s bill, were assigned by Thorn-burgh to Robert Cain. Before a justice of the peace, M\u2019Cleliand had obtained, on the 14th of February 1825, a judgment for 62 dollars and 30 cents against Thornburgh. On the 23d of December 1829 this judgment was assigned to Burns, the plaintiffs in error, by whom a transcript was taken and filed in the prothonotary\u2019s office on the 28th of December 1829. On the 30th of December the judgment obtained by Thornburgh against the plaintiffs in error, was, on motion, set off against so much of the judgment in the case of M\u2019Clelland for use against Thornburgh. On the 13th of January 1830, the debt, interest and costs, except prothonotary\u2019s, amounting to 59 dollars and 66 cents, of the Thornburgh judgment, were set off on the M\u2019Cleliand judgment agreeably to the order of court. A rule was then taken, on the 14th of August 1830, to show cause why the set-off should not be set aside. This rule was made absolute to the extent of the transfer of 20 dollars of the judgment for the fees of the attorneys. To this order exception was taken by the counsel of the defendants below.</summary>\n<attorneys data-order=\"4\" data-type=\"attorneys\" id=\"b78-9\">Burke, for plaintiffs in error,</attorneys>\n<p data-order=\"5\" data-type=\"legal\" id=\"A1\">contended, that attorneys had no lien on the judgment for their fees: and that the writ of error, in this case, could be sustained.
