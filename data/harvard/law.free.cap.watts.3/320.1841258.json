A submission by parol then took place, under which the following award was made.</summary>\n<summary data-order=\"4\" data-type=\"summary\" id=\"b320-10\">\u201c We, the undersigned, being chosen to settle all disputes between William Richardson and Patrick Cassily, do report, that in our opinion William Richardson ought to pay said Cassily the sum of 25 dollars, and pay all costs that may have accrued on the suit in court.</summary>\n<summary data-order=\"5\" data-type=\"summary\" id=\"b320-11\">\u201c William Lecky,</summary>\n<summary data-order=\"6\" data-type=\"summary\" id=\"b320-12\">\u201cThomas Cassily.</summary>\n<summary data-order=\"7\" data-type=\"summary\" id=\"b320-13\">\u201cApril 27, 1829.</summary>\n<summary data-order=\"8\" data-type=\"summary\" id=\"b320-14\">\u201cWe agree to the above award.</summary>\n<summary data-order=\"9\" data-type=\"summary\" id=\"b320-15\">\u201cWilliam Richardson,</summary>\n<summary data-order=\"10\" data-type=\"summary\" id=\"b320-16\">. \u201cP.

But that does not vitiate the award, which was agreed to by the parties after it was rendered. It will be treated as an award made under the act of 1705. Large <em>v. </em>Passmore, 5 <em>Serg. &amp; Rawle </em>51. There were no exceptions filed in the court below, where the judgment was not entered in a summary way. Whether it be an award at common law, or under the act of 1705, is immaterial.

Being by parol, it might, perhaps, be enforced by action ; but it was clearly erroneous to render judgment on it in the action pending.</p>\n<p id=\"b321-9\">Judgment reversed.</p>\n</opinion>\n</casebody>\n",
