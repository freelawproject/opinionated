Davis, his surety. The claim upon which the cause of action is founded, arose out of a transaction be, tween Dr John T. Stoxe deceased, and Hanson, on the deposit of a quantity of books, &amp;c. left with Hanson to be sold at auction. Upon the trial of the cause, the account of sales was produced and a balance on account of the proceeds was found due by the said Hanson to the administrator of Stoxe.</summary>\n<summary data-order=\"4\" data-type=\"summary\" id=\"b297-11\">The court below were requested to charge the jury that the action could not be supported, inasmuch as the official bond of an auctioneer of the city of Pittsburgh could not be resorted to by customers, or private dealers, and that the sureties of such auctioneer were only liable to the state in default of payment of duties, &amp;c. by the principal.</summary>\n<summary data-order=\"5\" data-type=\"summary\" id=\"b297-12\">The court, however, charged the jury that the surely was liable in the case before them.</summary>\n<summary data-order=\"6\" data-type=\"summary\" id=\"b297-13\">To this charge error was assigned.</summary>\n<attorneys data-order=\"7\" data-type=\"attorneys\" id=\"b297-14\"><em>Dallas, </em>for plaintiff in error.</attorneys>\n<p data-order=\"8\" data-type=\"legal\" id=\"b298-5\"><page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"298\">*298</page-number>The act of the 28th of March 1814, 6 <em>Smith\u2019s Laws </em>223, provides for the appointment of an auctioneer for Pittsburgh ; and the act of the 22d of March 1820, <em>7 Smith\u2019s Laws 274, </em>for the appointment of an additional auctioneer. The act of the 2d of April 1822, which prescribes particularly the duties of an auctioneer, is confined in its operation to the city of Philadelphia. The object of the bond, in the present case, was to secure the payment of the duties to the Commonwealth. The penalty of it being small, shows the legislative intent to have been to exclude the claims of private customers.
