The case presented the following facts. Gowen Henry had been convicted of forgery, sentenced to imprisonment for one week, and to pay the costs of prosecution: he was pardoned by the governor, and gave a bond to the Commonwealth, with security, to appear at the next court of common pleas to take the benefit of the insolvent laws : he was discharged, thereupon, from custody; but did not appear in pursuance of the condition of the bond. This suit was then brought on the bond to recover the amount of the costs of prosecution, for the pay<page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"385\">*385</page-number>ment of which the defendant\u2019s intestate had been committed.

That measure was introduced by the act of 1820, which relates by its terms but to debtors in execution, though the case of prisoners under sentence must have met the eye of the legislature, as it was embraced by the preceding legislation. Under these circumstances, and particularly as the legislature might well see reason to distinguish between those who are criminal and those who are but unfortunate, to be silent about it was to except it. The bond, then, being unauthorized by statute, cannot support an action.</p>\n<p id=\"b385-9\">Judgment reversed, and judgment rendered here for defendants.</p>\n</opinion>\n</casebody>\n",
