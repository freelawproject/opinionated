The declaration set forth, that Tipton had uttered words concerning Kahle, <em>\u201c </em>in substance as follows, to wit: the is perjured, and swore me out of a sum of money, and will swear any thing, and is a damned rascal: he is a thief, and I can prove it\u2019 (meaning that he, the said Frederick, was guilty of the crime of perjury, and was a base wicked and abandoned wretch, and would swear any thing, and meaning that the said Frederick was guilty of the crime of larceny, and he, the said Lee, could prove it).\u201d On the trial of the cause in the court below, it was proved Tipton had said that he had given Kahle leave to swear; that Kahle had sworn him out of a sum of lent money before Esquire Martin; and that Kahle was a thief, and had stolen apples.</summary>\n<summary data-order=\"5\" data-type=\"summary\" id=\"b90-12\">The following points were submitted by Tipton\u2019s counsel.</summary>\n<summary data-order=\"6\" data-type=\"summary\" id=\"b90-13\">1.

That if the jury believe there was a suit before Esquire Martin, between the plaintiff and defendant, and defendant agreed that plaintiff might make his oath as to certain facts, the oath so made is an extra judicial affidavit, and saying afterwards that the plaintiff had sworn him out of a sum of money in that case, is not actionable.</summary>\n<summary data-order=\"9\" data-type=\"summary\" id=\"b90-16\"><em>4. </em>That to say of another, \u201c he swore me out of a sum of money\u201d without more, or adding it was before Esquire Martin, is not actionable in itself, and .cannot be made so without producing the record <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"91\">*91</page-number>of a case before that justice, in which the party could be judicially sworn, and had been sworn as a witness.</summary>\n<summary data-order=\"10\" data-type=\"summary\" id=\"b91-6\">Errors assigned.</summary>\n<summary data-order=\"11\" data-type=\"summary\" id=\"b91-7\">1.

Maxwell and wife <em>v. </em>Allison, 11 <em>Serg. &amp; Rawle 344; </em>Van Vechten <em>v. </em>Hopkins, 5 <em>Johns. </em>223. The <em>colloquium, </em>if any was proved, was of an extra judicial affidavit, and not actionable. Shaffer <em>v. </em>Kintzer, 1 <em>Binn. 537. </em>On this point the court erred. The words showed that he spoke of the extra judicial oath. The words are not actionable in themselves; they could only be rendered so by reference to the particular proceeding, which must be proved. If the words relate to a particular transaction which shows that no crime could have been committed, although they, under other circumstances, might be actionable, yet they then cease to be so. Van Rensselaer <em>v. </em>Dole, 1 <em>Johns. Ca. </em>279; <em>Whart. Dig. </em>555, 556; Dr Shecut <em>v. </em>M\u2019Dowell, 1 <em>Cons. Rep.

The magistrate had no right to administer an extra judicial oath. An oath in a private matter is not perjury. 1 <em>Hawk. P. C. </em>318, 320, 322; <em>2 Russel on Cr. </em>517, <em>520; Archb. Cr. Pl. </em>249, 250; 4 <em>Chit. Bl. </em>137, <em>note. </em>To say of a man, \u201che swore a false oath and I can prove it,\u201d has been expressly decided to be not actionable. Parker <em>v. </em>Spangler, 2 <em>Binn. </em>60. So, \u201che swore false before Squire Andrews, and I can prove it.\u201d Stafford <em>v. </em>Green, 1 <em>Johns. 505. </em>So,'\u201c he swore false against me in Squire Jameson\u2019s court.\u201d Ward <em>v. </em>Clark, 2 <em>Johns. </em>10. So, \u201c he was forsworn in leet court.\u201d 1 <em>Bac. Ab. </em>207; Green <em>v. </em>Long, 2 <em>Caines\u2019s Rep. </em>91. There must be a <em>colloquium </em>of a trial, and it must appear that the evidence was material to the issue. Crookshank <em>v. </em>Gray and wife, 20 <em>Johns. </em>344. A <em>colloquium </em>is absolutely necessary and an <em>innuendo </em>will not help. Miller <em>v. </em>Miller, 8 <em>Johns. 74. </em>The witness may swear to a <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"92\">*92</page-number>lie without knowing, it. The oath may be extra judicial. The charge of perjury must be unequivocally conveyed. Hopkins v. Beedle, 1 <em>Caines\u2019s Rep. 347. If </em>the words relate to an oath not legally administered, they are not actionable. Harvey <em>v. </em>Boies, 1 <em>Penns. Rep. </em>12.</p>\n<p data-order=\"16\" data-type=\"legal\" id=\"b92-6\">The substance of the words, not of the charge, must be proved as laid in the declaration. <em>Stark. Ev. </em>845, 846, 847, <em>note </em>(e); 1 <em>Bac. Ab. </em>243, <em>note; Stark, on Slander, </em>270\u2014276. And the sense and manner must be the same. <em>Stark. Ev. </em>846, <em>note; </em>Miller <em>v. </em>Miller, 8 <em>Johns. </em>74; Kyzer <em>v. </em>Grubbs, 2 <em>M\u2019Cord\u2019s Rep. </em>305; M\u2019Connel <em>v. </em>M\u2019Coy, 7 <em>Serg. </em>&amp; <em>Rawle </em>223. For the application of this principle in the case of an indictment for perjury, see 2 <em>Russel on Cr. </em>546. A variance between the <em>allegata </em>and <em>probata </em>is fatal. <em>Stark on Slander </em>274.</p>\n<p data-order=\"17\" data-type=\"legal\" id=\"b92-7\">Matter of inducement, as well as other matter, must be legally proved, and if an oath is averred to be taken before a magistrate, legal evidence of a trial must be produced. 3 <em>Stark. Ev. </em>1551, <em>note </em>(x); 2 <em>Id. </em>867, <em>note; </em>Crookshank <em>v. </em>Gray and wife, 20 <em>Johns. </em>344; Bullock <em>v. </em>Koon, 9 <em>Cowen </em>30. The court erred in not instructing the jury whether the words proved were the same in substance as those laid in the declaration. Where the words are admitted and agreed on, it becomes a question of law whether they are, or are not, the same in substance. In Rue <em>v. </em>Mitchell, 2 <em>Dall. </em>58, the court overstrained the meaning of an <em>innuendo. </em>The meaning and object of an <em>innuendo </em>are clearly explained in 1 <em>Bac. Ab. </em>249; <em>Stark. on Slander </em>293\u2014296, 302.</p>\n<attorneys data-order=\"18\" data-type=\"attorneys\" id=\"b92-8\"><em>Thompson </em>and <em>Galbraith, </em>for the defendant in error.</attorneys>\n<p data-order=\"19\" data-type=\"legal\" id=\"b92-9\">Suppose no such suit existed as that to which the words had reference. Would they not amount to slander? The greater the slander, the more is it aggravated. It was for the jury to say whether the crime intended to be imputed was perjury. Eckhart <em>v. </em>Wilson, 10 <em>Serg. &amp; Rawle </em>44; Bloom and wife <em>v. </em>Bloom, 5 <em>Serg. &amp; Rawle </em>391; Walton <em>v. </em>Singleton, 7 <em>Serg. &amp; Rawle </em>449. Several witnesses swore to the reference to the suit before Esquire Martin. To this testimony there was no exception. The objection here is, that we laid more in our <em>narr. </em>than was proved. <em>It </em>was irregular and too late to make the objection after permitting us to give testimony of the suit before the justice. Nor is the <em>innuendo </em>in the declaration set forth in the paper book. This <em>innuendo </em>helped out the words and clearly rendered them actionable. Rue <em>v. </em>Mitchell, 2 <em>Dall. </em>58. The case of Shaffer <em>v. </em>Kintzer was one of a voluntary affidavit: and in Yundt <em>v. </em>Yundt, the <em>narr. </em>merely stated historically that the plaintiff had committed the crime of perjury.</p>\n<opinion data-order=\"20\" data-type=\"opinion\" id=\"x999-1\" type=\"majority\">\n<p id=\"b92-10\">The opinion of the Court was delivered by</p>\n<author id=\"b92-11\">Sergeant, J.</author>\n<p id=\"AEu\">Two errors have been assigned in this cause. The first is in the declaration, and the second in the court\u2019s answers to <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"93\">*93</page-number>the four points proposed to them by the-defendant\u2019s counsel. As we perceive no error, except in one of the answers of the court, it is unnecessary to repeat all these points in detail. That one is the answer given by the court to the defendant\u2019s third point.</p>\n<p id=\"b93-6\">The court was correct in saying that the words laid in the declation, \u201che swore me out of a sum of money,\u201d were not actionable. But the consequence was, that all proof in relation to those words ought to have been thrown out of view by the jury; for it is unjust to assess damages in part or in whole for words not actionable: and therefore the court were wrong in afterwards leaving it to the jury to judge whether the charge thus laid was proved, and whether the defendant meant to charge the plaintiff with perjury. No <em>innuendo, </em>though found by the jury, could render the defendant liable for words not in themselves actionable. It is well settled that the office of an <em>innuendo </em>is to elucidate the meaning of the words uttered, not to alter their nature. Shaffer <em>v. </em>Kintzer, 1 <em>Binn. </em>537; Packer <em>v. </em>Spangler, 2 <em>Binn. 60.</em></p>\n<p id=\"b93-7\">If it was meant by the court that the jury might take the proof of these words into consideration, under the averment in the declaration that the defendant had said of the plaintiff \u201c he is guilty of perjury,\u201d it is impossible to assent to such a principle. There was no proof whatever that the defendant had uttered these words as here laid. The words proved by the witnesses were, substantially, \u201c he swore me out of a sum of money.\u201d One of these witnesses added, that he said \u201che had given him leave to swear,\u201d and another, that he said \u201cit was before Esquire Martin.\u201d Now it could not be allowed to the plaintiff to support an averment, that defendant had said \u201c he is guilty of perjury,\u201d by words altogether different, even if they imported that charge. The meaning of the decision in Kennedy <em>v. </em>Lowry, 1 <em>Binn. </em>393, that the substance of the words may be- stated in the declaration, is, that the plaintiff need not set out every identical word spoken by the defendant, but may give the purport of what was said by him. For example, words may be laid to have been spoken in the second person, and proved in the third: redundant epithets may be omitted : synonymous terms may, in some cases, be substituted conveying the same ideas: but it is not permitted to drop altogether both the language and ideas uttered, and sum up all in one round charge, and then leave it to the jury to say whether the words proved amounted to that charge. Such a course would -deprive the defendant of notice of the complaint against him; would perplex and embarrass him in justifying or explaining the words he had used, and would transfer from the court their duty of deciding how far the words used were actionable. It would, in fine, derange the whole system of the law relative to actions of slander.</p>\n<p id=\"b93-8\">But had all the words proved to have been used by the defendant on this subject been laid in the <em>nan., </em>it would not have bettered the plaintiff\u2019s case. Whether the swearing was false or not; whether, if false, it was in a judicial proceeding, was not stated by the defend-, <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"94\">*94</page-number>ant. There is no <em>colloquium </em>of any such proceeding, or of the plaintiff\u2019s having taken an oath judicially. The words do not seem any thing like as strong as those used in Packer <em>v. </em>Spangler, <em>2 Binn. 60. </em>There it was held that to say, <em>\u201c </em>she swore a false oath and I can prove it,\u201d was not actionable; nor could they be helped by an <em>innuendo </em>of perjury. To the same effect is Shaffer <em>v. </em>Kintzer, 1 <em>Binn. </em>537.</p>\n<p id=\"b94-6\">There are other words in this count which were clearly actionable, and which appear to have been fully proved. The case ought. to have gone to the jury on them alone, and it was error to allow the other words charged, to be taken into their consideration in assessing damages. For these reasons the judgment is reversed.</p>\n<p id=\"b94-7\">Judgment reversed, and a <em>venire de novo </em>awarded.</p>\n</opinion>\n</casebody>\n",
