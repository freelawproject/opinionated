On the trial of the cause, John White was produced as a witness by the plaintiff below, and objected to by the defendants on the ground of his being interested in the event of the suit. . It appeared from a <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"365\">*365</page-number>statement made by White on his <em>voir dire, </em>and the evidence given, that Garret Guest, one of the defendants, had had a n\u00f3te of 300 dollars discounted at the Bank of Pittsburgh, drawn by himself, payable to the order of White, by whom it was indorsed first, and again by Lent, the plaintiff as the second indorser, for- the accommodation of Guest. The note, not being paid at maturity, was protested for non payment. Lent, the plaintiff, paid 100 dollars, and White the remaining 200 dollars. The defendants, by Guest, paid Lent 100 dollars, which they alleged and claimed to have been paid on account of the plaintiff\u2019s demand in this action, but which the plaintiff said was paid on account of the note; and White was offered as a witness by him to prove that Guest told the witness he had paid the 100&gt; dollars on the note. The court below decided in favour of the competency of the witness, and he was accordingly admitted to give his testimony; to which the defendants\u2019 counsel excepted, and have assigned it here for error.</summary>\n<attorneys data-order=\"4\" data-type=\"attorneys\" id=\"b365-6\"><em>Dallas, </em>for plaintiffs in error.</attorneys>\n<attorneys data-order=\"5\" data-type=\"attorneys\" id=\"b365-7\"><em>Burke, </em>for defendant in error.</attorneys>\n<p data-order=\"6\" data-type=\"legal\" id=\"b365-8\">If Guest applied partnership funds to the payment of the 100 dollars on the note, it was a matter between him and his partners, and not between White and them. What effect then would a verdict in this case have on White <em>1 </em>What possible interest could he have in the result of this suit, as the application of the 100 dollars had been already made, and the amount credited on the note ? A witness must have a certain and direct interest in the result of the suit, to render his testimony inadmissible.

Hence, White being called as a witness to prove that the 100 dollars paid by Guest to Lent, ought to be ap<page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"366\">*366</page-number>propriated to the note, and not to the discharge of the plaintiff\u2019s demand in this action, was in effect produced to support a claim of the plaintiff, which, if successful, discharged him at once from all further liability to the plaintiff to pay him the 100 dollars. I therefore think he was not a competent witness.</p>\n<p id=\"b366-6\">Judgment reversed, and a <em>.venire de novo </em>awarded.</p>\n</opinion>\n</casebody>\n",
