The defendants proved that the directions of the acts of assembly in relation to voluntary assignments had been strictly pursued. ,</summary>\n<summary data-order=\"22\" data-type=\"summary\" id=\"b200-13\">The court charged in favour of the validity of the voluntary deed of assignment, and the jury found accordingly for the defendants.'</summary>\n<summary data-order=\"23\" data-type=\"summary\" id=\"b200-14\">Predicated upon the tenth and last clauses in that deed, the following, amongst other reasons for a new trial, was assigned by the appellant.</summary>\n<attorneys data-order=\"24\" data-type=\"attorneys\" id=\"b200-15\"><em>Fetterman, </em>for the appellant. .</attorneys>\n<p data-order=\"25\" data-type=\"legal\" id=\"b200-16\">The main question, presented .in this -case, arises out of the tenth and last provisions or clauses in the voluntary deed of assignment, which, we contend, render the assignment fraudulent and void under the statute of 13 <em>Eliz. c. 5. </em>If a part be void, the whole is void. M\u2019Clurg v. Lecky, 3 <em>Penns. Rep. </em>86. If by those clauses the surplus had been made payable to the creditors generally, the assign<page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"201\">*201</page-number>ment would have been good. But as it secures a trust in favour of the assignor himself, its tendency is to defraud creditors, and it therefore comes directly within the meaning of the statute of <em>Elizabeth. </em>Such assignments have every where, except in Pennsylvania, been decided to be void. But even here, one and a leading case, bearing a strong analogy to the present, has been decided against their validity. Burd v. Lessee of Fitzsimmons et al., 4 Dall. 75. In M\u2019Clurg v. Lecky, 3 <em>Penns. Rep. </em>91, Justice Rogers went further than the cases there cited could justify. In Wilt <em>v. </em>Franklin, 1 <em>Binn. </em>502, the assignment directed the money to be fairly divided amongst all the assignor\u2019s creditors, and the surplus, if any, to himself. It was, therefore, very properly sustained, and did just what the bankrupt law would have done. In Lippincott <em>v. </em>Barker, 2 <em>Binn. </em>174, the principle contended for by the appellees was doubted by Chief Justice Tilghman; and the question,\u2018brought up in the present case, was not before the court. The debtor cannot raise a secret trust for the benefit of himself or family. M\u2019Callister <em>v. </em>Marshall, 6 <em>Binn. 338; </em>Passmore <em>v. </em>Eldridge, 12 <em>Serg. &amp; Rawle </em>198. Such are the authorities in our own state; which, it is conceived, do not establish the principle contended for on the other side. The weight of authorities in other states is decisively against the principle. A debtor cannot prescribe any terms to his crditors. Ingraham <em>v. </em>Wheeler, 6 <em>Conn. Rep. </em>277. The property of an insolvent must be held for the equal benefit of all his creditors. Hyslop <em>v. </em>Clarke, 14 <em>Johns. </em>458; Seaving <em>v. </em>Brinkerhoff, 5 <em>Johns. Ch. </em>332; 2 <em>Pick. </em>129; Austin et al. <em>v. </em>Bell, 20 <em>Johns. </em>442; Mackie v. Cairns, 1 <em>Hop. Ch. </em>404; Mackie v. Cairns, 5 <em>Cowen </em>580; 1 <em>Edw. </em>79; <em>Ibid. </em>451; 5 <em>Ohio Rep. </em>293; 8 <em>Am. Jurist </em>286. In Brashear v. West et al., 7 <em>Peters </em>608, and Pierpont v. Lord, 4 <em>Wash. </em>232, both parties claimed under a deed of assignment. Ingraham v. Geyer, 13 <em>Mass. </em>146.</p>\n<p data-order=\"26\" data-type=\"legal\" id=\"b201-6\">The court declined hearing</p>\n<attorneys data-order=\"27\" data-type=\"attorneys\" id=\"AVd\"><em>Watts </em>and <em>Biddle </em>for the appellees.</attorneys>\n<opinion data-order=\"28\" data-type=\"opinion\" id=\"x999-1\" type=\"majority\">\n<author id=\"b201-7\">Per Curiam.</author>\n<p id=\"AMm\">Though it would have been better had these conditional assignments been brought within the purview of the 13 <em>Eliz., </em>as they might have been originally, and, in fact, have been in some of our sister states; it is too late to do so now. They have occurred in countless numbers, and have been sustained when brought before the courts; so that the title to an imnlense amount of property, perhaps to the value of millions, depends on them; and we should introduce a scene of the wildest confusion, perhaps of mercantile ruin, were we to disturb it. We are required by the argument, in effect, to overturn a train of decisions deeply seated in authority, and introductive of a peculiar rule of property; and whatever considerations of reason or policy might have been presented to this court originally, as inducements to lay the foundations of this part of our jurisprudence differently, it is sufficient that the time for it has gone by, and that we are to administer the justice of the coun<page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"202\">*202</page-number>try according to the laws as we find them. We therefore think that a new trial was properly refused.</p>\n<p id=\"b202-6\">Judgment affirmed.</p>\n</opinion>\n</casebody>\n",
