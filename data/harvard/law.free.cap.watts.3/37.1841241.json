The defendan t below claimed the land as a parol grant from the plaintiff\u2019s father in consideration of horse-shoeing; and contended for a conditional line, by which the father agreed the land should be bounded. There was no dispute as to these facts; but there was no evidence of possession by the defendant <em>in pursuance </em>of <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"38\">*38</page-number>the verbal agreement. Verdict and judgment were rendered for the plaintiff below.</summary>\n<summary data-order=\"4\" data-type=\"summary\" id=\"b38-6\">The following error was assigned:</summary>\n<summary data-order=\"5\" data-type=\"summary\" id=\"b38-7\">The court erred in charging the jury in substance, that the declarations of the plaintiff below,,that his father, under whom he claimed, had given a.small piece of ground within the defendant\u2019s lines to said defendant for horse-shoeing, did not take the case out of the statute of frauds and perjuries, nor were they sufficient to establish a conditional line between the parties.</summary>\n<attorneys data-order=\"6\" data-type=\"attorneys\" id=\"b38-8\">Burke, for the plaintiff in error.</attorneys>\n<p data-order=\"7\" data-type=\"legal\" id=\"b38-9\">Our defence was, that although a part of the land of M\u2019Farland was within Hall\u2019s lines, it was given to M\u2019Farland by Hall\u2019s father. This part was bounded by a conditional line, marked by a black oak and an old fence, which had been recognized by the neighbours for <em>seventeen </em>years, during all which time M\u2019Farland remained in possession. We proved the declaration of Hall, that his father had made the donation to M\u2019Farland for shoeing horses. Possession and the payment of the purchase money take the case out of the statute against frauds and perjuries. And there was no dispute in this case as to the payment of the consideration. Bassler <em>v. </em>Neisely et al., 2 <em>Serg. &amp; Rawle </em>352. Here the land was improved and converted into a meadow by the defendant. Billington <em>v. </em>Welsh, 5 <em>Binn. </em>129, 131; 1 <em>Binn. </em>378; Smith <em>v. </em>Lessee of Patton and wife, 1 <em>Serg. &amp; Rawle </em>80; Clarke et al. <em>v. </em>Vankirk, 4 <em>Serg. &amp; Rawle </em>354.</p>\n<attorneys data-order=\"8\" data-type=\"attorneys\" id=\"b38-10\"><em>Fetterman, </em>for the defendant in error.</attorneys>\n<p data-order=\"9\" data-type=\"legal\" id=\"b38-11\">The parties live on adjoining tracts of land. We proved that the conditional line for which M\u2019Farland contended, was in fact between the father of Hall and a man by the name of Wolf. The evidence went to destroy the conditional line under which the defendant below claimed, and to justify trespass. The possession must refer to and be in pursuance of the sale. Of this there' was no evidence. Jones <em>v. </em>Peterman et al., 3 <em>Serg &amp; Rawle </em>543.</p>\n<opinion data-order=\"10\" data-type=\"opinion\" id=\"x999-1\" type=\"majority\">\n<author id=\"b38-12\">Per Curiam.</author>\n<p id=\"AlL\">It is conceded that there was no delivery of possession under the contract; and it is therefore in effect conceded that there was no part execution of the contract to take it out of the stat-, me of frauds.</p>\n<p id=\"b38-13\">Judgment affirmed.</p>\n</opinion>\n</casebody>\n",
