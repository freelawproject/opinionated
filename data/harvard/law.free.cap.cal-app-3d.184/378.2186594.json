Deane Moore, plaintiffs below, appeal from a judgment granting defendant Board of Administration, Public Employees\u2019 Retirement System\u2019s (Board) motion for judgment on the pleadings. In the published portion of this opinion we consider the plaintiffs\u2019 claim<footnotemark>1</footnotemark> that the Board\u2019s use of sex-based actuarial tables to compute optional retirement benefits violates title VII of <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"380\">*380</page-number>the Civil Rights Act of 1964, 42 United States Code section 2000e et seq.<footnotemark>2</footnotemark> The trial court concluded that relief is precluded by the United States Supreme Court\u2019s decision in <em>Arizona Governing Committee </em>v. <em>Norris </em>(1983) 463 U.S. 1073 [77 L.Ed.2d 1236, 103 S.Ct. 3492], We agree with that conclusion on the separate ground that the state courts lack jurisdiction to entertain a claim predicated upon title 42 United States Code section 2000e-2. In the unpublished portion of the opinion we reject the plaintiffs\u2019 equal protection claims. Accordingly, we will affirm the judgment.</p>\n<p id=\"b212-5\">Facts</p>\n<p id=\"b212-6\">Government Code sections 20000 et seq. comprise the Public Employees\u2019 Retirement Law. Section 20600.1 prohibits the use of sex-based tables for the determination of employees\u2019 retirement contributions or benefits.<footnotemark>3</footnotemark> However, in lieu of a retirement allowance for his life alone, a member may elect an optional plan whereby his retirement allowance is lessened and an allowance is paid to his beneficiary after his death. (See Gov. Code, \u00a7\u00a7 21330-21339.) The prohibition on sex-based tables does not apply to \u201cthe computation of the actuarial equivalents required under this part for the determination of optional payments.\u201d (\u00a7 20600.1)</p>\n<p id=\"b212-7\">Until July 1, 1982, the Board used actuarial tables which differentiated on the basis of sex to compute the optional benefits. Because of a concern that use of such tables was a prohibited discrimination,<footnotemark>4</footnotemark> the Board adopted by resolution \u201csingle, best-factor\u201d tables in lieu thereof. These tables are \u201ceffective for all retirements on or after July 1, 1982, of individuals who were members of the System prior to July 1, 1982 . . . ,\u201d<footnotemark>5</footnotemark></p>\n<p id=\"b213-5\"><page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"381\">*381</page-number>Plaintiff N. Deane Moore elected an optional settlement plan at the time of his retirement, inferably prior to July 1, 1982. Plaintiffs filed this action labeled as a complaint for declaratory relief but sought to certify a class of \u201call persons who have received and/or are presently receiving monthly retirement or survivor allowances from the Public Employees\u2019 Retirement System which are different in amount from those received by retired members of similar age and circumstances and their beneficiaries on account of the use of sex-based tables in calculating an optional settlement.\u201d The complaint alleges: the Board has used sex-based tables to compute optional retirement settlements since January 1, 1977; retirees with female beneficiaries receive a lower monthly retirement allowance than do retirees with male beneficiaries; different benefit allowances result from the use of sex-based tables; the Board took formal action to cease the use of sex-based tables for members retiring on or after July 1, 1982, who choose an optional plan; the Board adopted a \u201cbest-benefit factor\u201d plan for those retirees; the Board failed to recognize the right of plaintiffs to the same or better treatment. Plaintiffs further allege that all members of the class have been denied equal protection of the law and have been discriminated against solely on the basis of sex in violation of title VII of the Civil Rights Act of 1964, 42 United States Code section 2000e et seq.</p>\n<p id=\"b213-6\">The plaintiffs sought a declaration of the rights and duties of the parties pursuant to title VII and a judgment recalculating plaintiff class members\u2019 optional benefits. The Board was granted a judgment on the pleadings on the ground that the relief requested cannot be granted as a matter of law, relying upon <em>Arizona Governing Committee </em>v. <em>Norris, supra. </em>This appeal followed.</p>\n<p id=\"b213-7\">Discussion</p>\n<p id=\"b213-8\">I</p>\n<p id=\"b213-9\">A judgment on the pleadings has the same purpose and effect as a general demurrer. (See <em>Colberg, Inc. </em>v. <em>State of California </em>(1967) 67 Cal.2d 408, 411-412 [62 Cal.Rptr. 401, 432 P.2d 3]; 4 Witkin, Cal. Procedure (2d ed. 1971) Proceedings Without Trial, \u00a7 164, p. 2819.) It is appropriate if the complaint fails to \u201cstate facts sufficient to constitute a cause of action.\u201d (Code Civ. Proc., \u00a7 430.10, subd. (e).) The trial court concluded that <em>Norris, supra, </em>463 U.S. 1073 was dispositive of plaintiffs\u2019 title VII claim because it is \u201capplicable only prospectively to future benefits derived from contributions collected after the effective date of the judgment [1983].\u201d  As we shall show <em>Norris </em>is predicated upon judicial remedies provided in title VII which lie exclusively in the federal district courts.</p>\n<p id=\"b214-4\"><page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"382\">*382</page-number>In <em>Norris, supra, </em>the Supreme Court addressed the question whether title VII of the Civil Rights Act of 1964 prohibits an employer from offering optional retirement plans through insurance companies selected by the employer which pay women lower monthly benefits than men who have made the same contributions. It relied on its earlier decision in <em>Los Angeles Dept. of Water &amp; Power </em>v. <em>Manhart </em>(1978) 435 U.S. 702 [55 L.Ed.2d 657, 98 S.Ct. 1370], which held that title VII prohibits an employer from requiring women to make larger contributions in order to obtain the same retirement benefits as men.</p>\n<p id=\"b214-5\"><em>Manhart </em>distinguished between the rights conferred by title VII and remedies provided by title VII for invasion of the rights. As to rights, <em>Manhart </em>held that the practice of requiring greater contributions from women \u201cdoes not pass the simple test of whether the evidence shows \u2018treatment of a person in a manner which but for that person\u2019s sex would be different.\u2019\u201d (435 U.S. at p. 711 [55 L.Ed.2d at p. 667]; fn. omitted.) That principle, of course, applies as much to retirement benefits as to retirement contributions. Neither can be predicated upon a distinction based upon sex.</p>\n<p id=\"b214-6\">However, a different question is posed with respect to the remedy provided by title VII. On this point <em>Manhart </em>says that \u201cTitle VII does not require a <em>district </em>court to grant any retroactive relief. A court that finds unlawful discrimination \u2018may enjoin [the discrimination] . . . and order such affirmative action as may be appropriate, which may include, but is not limited to, reinstatement . . . with or without back pay ... or any other equitable relief as the court deems appropriate.\u2019 42 U.S.C. \u00a7 2000e-5(g) (1970 ed., Supp. V).\u201d <em>(Manhart, supra, </em>435 U.S. at p. 718 [55 L.Ed.2d at p. 671]; italics added. )<footnotemark>6</footnotemark> <em>Manhart </em>did stress that under <em>Albemarle Paper Co. </em>v. <em>Moody, </em>(1975) 422 U.S. 405 [45 L.Ed.2d 280, 95 S.Ct. 2362] there is a \u201cpresumption in favor of retroactive liability [which] can seldom be overcome . . . .\u201d <em>(Id., </em>at p. 719 [55 L.Ed.2d at p. 672].) Similarly, <em>Norris </em>made a distinction between title VII rights and remedies. It noted that <em>\u201cManhart </em>squarely rejected the notion that, because women as a class live longer than men, an employer may adopt a retirement plan that treats every individual woman less favorably than every individual man. [Citations.]\u201d <em>(Id., </em>463 U.S. at p. 1083 [77 L.Ed.2d at p. 1248].) Although <em>Manhart </em>involved unequal contributions and <em>Norris </em>involved unequal benefits, the <em>Norris </em>court <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"383\">*383</page-number>had \u201cno hesitation in holding . . . that the classification of employees on the basis of sex is no more permissible at the pay-out stage of a retirement plan than at the pay-in stage.\u201d <em>(Id., </em>at p. 1081 [77 L.Ed.2d at pp. 1246-1247]; fn. omitted.) The court then proceeded to consider whether the statute applied when the state delegated the method of calculation of retirement benefits to third parties,<footnotemark>7</footnotemark> i.e., private insurance companies chosen by the state.<footnotemark>8</footnotemark> The court concluded the state was legally responsible for the discriminatory terms on which the annuities were offered by the companies.<footnotemark>9</footnotemark></p>\n<p id=\"b215-6\">Liability was deemed to be prospective only, however. The court noted that <em>Manhart </em>\u201cput all employer-operated pension funds on notice that they could not Tequir[e] that men and women make unequal contributions to [the] fund,\u2019 [citation] . . . .\u201d <em>(Norris, supra, </em>463 U.S. at p. 1106 [77 L.Ed.2d at p. 1262.) However, the court expressed concern that ambiguous language in <em>Manhart </em>may have led an employer to reasonably assume that it could lawfully make available to its employees annuities offered by insurance companies on the open market, even though such companies used sex-based tables. The court asserted that to hold employers liable retroactively would have devastating results. <em>(Id., </em>at p. 1106 [77 L.Ed.2d at p. 1263].) \u201c[I]n view of the question left open in <em>Manhart,\u201d </em>the court refused \u201cto impose this magnitude of burden retroactively on the public.\u201d <em>(Id., </em>at p. 1107 [77 L.Ed.2d at p. 1263].) Therefore, it held that although \u201cretroactive relief is normally appropriate in the typical Title VII case,\u201d liability would be prospective only. \u201c[0]nly benefits derived from contributions collected after the effective date of the judgment need be calculated without regard to the sex of the employee.\u201d <em>(Id., </em>at p. 1107, fn. 12 [77 L.Ed.2d at p. 1263].)<footnotemark>10</footnotemark></p>\n<p id=\"b216-4\"><page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"384\">*384</page-number>II</p>\n<p id=\"b216-5\"><em>Manhart </em>and <em>Norris </em>involve specific applications of section 706 of title VII (42 U.S.C. \u00a7 2000e-5) which sets forth the federal statutory remedies for violation of 42 United States Code section 2000e-2. As will be shown, that section provides that a judicial remedy lies only in a federal district court. That being the case, the state courts lack jurisdiction to hear such an action.</p>\n<p id=\"b216-6\">The Ninth Circuit Court of Appeals has recently held that the federal courts possess exclusive jurisdiction over title VII actions. <em>(Valenzuela </em>v. <em>Kraft, Inc. </em>(9th Cir. 1984) 739 F.2d 434, accord <em>Dyer </em>v. <em>Greif Bros., Inc. </em>(9th Cir. 1985) 755 F.2d 1391.) <em>Valenzuela, </em>following <em>Gulf Offshore Co. </em>v. <em>Mobil Oil Corp. </em>(1981) 453 U.S. 473, 478 [69 L.Ed.2d 784, 791, 101 S.Ct. 2870], states that a court should \u201cbegin[] with the presumption that state courts enjoy concurrent jurisdiction. . . . [T]he presumption . . . can be rebutted by an explicit statutory directive, by unmistakable implication from legislative history, or by a clear incompatibility between state-court jurisdiction and federal interests.\u201d <em>(Valenzuela, </em>at p. 435; see also <em>Calif. Satellite Systems, Inc. </em>v. <em>Nichols </em>(1985) 170 Cal.App.3d 56, 65-66 [216 Cal.Rptr. 180].) Although there is no explicit directive in the provisions under consideration, <em>Valenzuela </em>concluded that there was exclusive federal jurisdiction on the ground that the remedial provisions of title VII show an \u201c\u2018unmistakable implication\u2019 of federal jurisdiction\u201d which rebuts the presumption that state courts enjoy concurrent jurisdiction. We will not repeat the <em>Valenzuela </em>reasoning. We will conclude for the reasons which we next discuss that the Ninth Circuit decision is correct.</p>\n<p id=\"b216-7\">The pertinent enforcement provisions of title VII at issue in <em>Norris </em>and <em>Manhart </em>are contained in 42 United States Code section 2000e-5. The section specifically addresses the remedies available for an \u201cunlawful employment practice occurring in a State, or political subdivision of a State . . . .\u201d (\u00a7\u00a7 2000e-5(c) and (d).) Subsection (f) provides that as a prerequisite to a civil action, a charge must be filed with the federal Civil Rights Commission. Subsection (c) provides that where the respondent is a state or its political subdivision and the state has a local law prohibiting the unlawful employment practice, resort must first be had to that law. If these conditions have been met and the respondent is a \u201cgovernment, governmental agency, or political subdivision\u201d and the commission has been unable to secure an acceptable conciliation agreement, the commission is directed to refer the case to the <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"385\">*385</page-number>Attorney General \u201cwho may bring a civil action against such respondent in the appropriate <em>United States district court. </em>\u201d (Italics added.) An aggrieved party may intervene in such an action. <em>(Ibid.) </em>If no such action is instituted, the aggrieved party may institute a civil action. The only implication to be drawn from subsection (f) is that this action must be brought in a federal district court for the section provides that \u201cthe court may . . . stay further proceedings . . . pending the termination of State or local proceedings described in subsections (c) . . . .\u201d That section, as noted, refers to actions brought under <em>state </em>law. It is manifest that 42 United States Code section 2000e-5 contemplates federal remedies as the exclusive means for redress of a violation of section 2000e-2.</p>\n<p id=\"b217-6\">III<footnotemark>*</footnotemark></p>\n<p id=\"b217-7\">Disposition</p>\n<p id=\"b217-8\">The judgment is affirmed.</p>\n<p id=\"b217-9\">Puglia, P.
