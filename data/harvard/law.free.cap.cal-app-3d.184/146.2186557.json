J.</author>\n<p id=\"b137-14\">I</p>\n<p id=\"b137-15\">Defendant Edward Jaimez appeals from a judgment of conviction entered after a jury found him guilty of assault by means of force likely to cause <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"148\">*148</page-number>great bodily injury (Pen. Code, \u00a7 245, subd. (a)(1))<footnotemark>1</footnotemark> and battery with serious bodily injury (\u00a7\u00a7 242-243, subd. (d)). The jury also found true allegations that defendant inflicted great bodily injury (\u00a7 12022.7) and the victim was 60 years of age or older (\u00a7 1203.09, subd. (f)). Defendant was sentenced to a term of seven years in state prison.</p>\n<p id=\"b138-4\">On appeal defendant raises issues involving the admissibility of certain evidence, jury instructions and sentencing. For the reasons stated below, we affirm the judgment.</p>\n<p id=\"b138-5\">The facts may be summarized as follows; As 69-year-old Lam Hoa was crossing the street near his home, he was grabbed from behind and carried over to a wooded area by defendant. Mr. Hoa was placed on the ground whereupon defendant took his cane, pipe and sunglasses. Defendant then began to search him for valuables. Finding no wallet, he attempted to remove Mr. Hoa\u2019s wedding ring. When Mr. Hoa resisted, defendant hit him several times on his right shoulder. Mr. Hoa\u2019s arm was broken in three places. Several witnesses heard Mr. Hoa shouting and observed him on the ground with defendant on top of him. Eventually defendant walked away from the scene. Two witnesses followed him to his home where he was later arrested.</p>\n<p id=\"b138-6\">In sentencing defendant the court imposed the upper term of four years for the violation of section 245, subdivision (a)(1), and a three-year enhancement for the violation of section 12022.7. The upper term of four years for the violation of sections 242-243, subdivision (d), was also imposed, but stayed pursuant to section 654.</p>\n<p id=\"b138-7\">Defendant contends the trial court erred in ruling admissible for impeachment, defendant\u2019s prior felony convictions for pimping (\u00a7 266h)<footnotemark>2</footnotemark> in 1974, pandering (\u00a7 266i)<footnotemark>3</footnotemark> in 1974, and burglary (\u00a7 459) in 1973, were <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"149\">*149</page-number>defendant to testify. Relying upon <em>People </em>v. <em>Castro </em>(1985) 38 Cal.3d 301 [211 Cal.Rptr. 719, 696 P.2d 111], defendant argues these offenses do not evidence moral turpitude and, even if they do, the prejudicial effect of such evidence requires its exclusion.</p>\n<p id=\"b139-5\">The <em>Castro </em>court, interpreting section 28, subdivision (f), article I of the California Constitution, set forth a two-prong analysis to determine the admissibility of prior convictions.<footnotemark>4</footnotemark> The trial court must first determine whether the prior conviction involves moral turpitude. If moral turpitude is not involved, the prior conviction may not be admitted. If the prior conviction involves moral turpitude, the court must yet exercise its discretion whether to exclude the conviction under Evidence Code section 352. <em>(Castro, supra, </em>at p. 316.)</p>\n<p id=\"b139-6\"><em>Castro </em>pointed out offenses of moral turpitude encompassed those inherently involving dishonesty such as theft and also nontheft crimes such as child abuse, or those committed by force and violence or brutality or threat thereof. <em>(Id.., </em>at p. 315.) In reaching this conclusion the court observed that \u201cit is easier to infer that a witness is lying if the felony of which he has been convicted involves dishonesty as a necessary element than when it merely indicates a \u2018bad character\u2019 and \u2018general readiness to do evil.\u2019 Nevertheless, it is undeniable that a witness\u2019 moral depravity of any kind has some \u2018tendency in reason\u2019 (Evid. Code, \u00a7 210) to shake one\u2019s confidence in his honesty.\u201d <em>(Id., </em>at p. 315.)</p>\n<p id=\"b139-7\">Applying these principles to the facts in <em>Castro, </em>the court held simple possession of heroin does not necessarily involve moral turpitude, but possession of heroin for sale does. The court observed the trait involved in possession for sale was not dishonesty, but \u201cthe intent to corrupt others.\u201d <em>(Id., </em>at p. 317.)</p>\n<p id=\"b139-8\">In <em>In re Fahey </em>(1973) 8 Cal.3d 842 [106 Cal.Rptr. 313, 505 P.2d 1369, 63 A.L.R.3d 465], a proceeding involving attorney discipline, our Supreme Court approved a definition of moral turpitude as \u201c\u2018an act of <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"150\">*150</page-number>baseness, vileness or depravity in the private and social duties which a man owes to his fellowmen, or to society in general, contrary to the accepted and customary rule of right and duty between man and man.\u2019\u201d <em>(Id., </em>at p. 849.) The court cited as examples of crimes involving moral turpitude those which are \u201cextremely repugnant to accepted moral standards such as . . . serious sexual offenses <em>(In re Boyd </em>[1957] 48 Cal.2d 69 [307 P.2d 625]).\u201d <em>(Ibid.) </em>In <em>In re Boyd, </em>the petitioner had pled guilty to a violation of section 647, which provided, inter alia, every lewd or dissolute person is a vagrant. In holding that such an offense involved moral turpitude, the <em>Boyd </em>court relied upon a line of cases involving indecent exposure.</p>\n<p id=\"b140-4\">The Supreme Court in <em>Castro, supra, </em>38 Cal.3d 301, referred to the annotation in 23 A.L.R. Fed. 480 entitled, \u201cWhat Constitutes \u2018Crime Involving Moral Turpitude\u2019 Within Meaning of \u00a7\u00a7 212(a)(9) and 241(a)(4) of Immigration and Nationality Act (8 USCS \u00a7\u00a7 1182(a)(9), 1251(a)(4)), and Similar Predecessor Statutes Providing for Exclusion or Deportation of Aliens Convicted of Such Crime\u201d and 1 Witkin, California Procedure (2d ed. 1970) Attorneys, section 195. <em>(Castro, supra, </em>at p. 316, fn. 11.) (3) The annotation points out that prostitution and related offenses such as pimping and pandering have generally been recognized as crimes involving moral turpitude. (23 A.L.R.Fed., <em>supra, </em>at pp. 565, 566.) Keeping a house of prostitution (\u00a7 315) has also been held a crime involving moral turpitude. <em>(Selowsky </em>v. <em>Superior Court of Napa Co. </em>(1919) 180 Cal. 404, 410 [181 P. 652].) The purpose of the statutes prohibiting pimping and pandering is to prevent prostitution by discouraging individuals from expanding the prostitute\u2019s operations. <em>(People </em>v. <em>Hashimoto </em>(1976) 54 Cal.App.3d 862, 867 [126 Cal.Rptr. 848].)</p>\n<p id=\"b140-5\">Pimping and pandering involve the corruption of others. The perpetrator of these offenses encourages, or profits from, the commission of crimes by others. The offenses evidence a \u201creadiness to do evil\u201d <em>(People </em>v. <em>Castro, supra, </em>38 Cal.3d 301, 315) and are \u201cextremely repugnant to accepted moral standards.\u201d <em>(In re Fahey, supra, </em>8 Cal.3d 842, 849.) Accordingly, we hold pimping and pandering are crimes of moral turpitude.</p>\n<p id=\"b140-6\">II-VI<footnotemark>*</footnotemark></p>\n<p id=\"b141-4\"><page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"151\">*151</page-number>VII</p>\n<p id=\"b141-5\">The judgment is affirmed.</p>\n<p id=\"b141-6\">Brauer, J., and Phillips, J.,<footnotemark>*</footnotemark> concurred.</p>\n<footnote label=\"1\">\n<p id=\"b138-8\">All other references are to the Penal Code unless otherwise noted.</p>\n</footnote>\n<footnote label=\"2\">\n<p id=\"b138-9\">Section 266h provides in relevant part that \u201cAny person who, knowing another person is a prostitute, lives or derives support or maintenance in whole or in part from the earnings or proceeds of the person\u2019s prostitution, or from money loaned or advanced to or charged against that person by any keeper or manager or inmate of a house or other place where prostitution is practiced or allowed, or who solicits or receives compensation for soliciting for the person, is guilty of pimping, ...\u201d</p>\n</footnote>\n<footnote label=\"3\">\n<p id=\"b138-10\">Pandering is defined in section 266i as follows: \u201cAny person who: (a) procures another person for the purpose of prostitution; or (b) by promises, threats, violence, or by any device or scheme, causes, induces, persuades or encourages another person to become a prostitute; or (c) procures for another person a place as inmate in a house of prostitution or as an inmate of any place in which prostitution is encouraged or allowed within this state; or (d) by promises, threats, violence or by any device or scheme, causes, induces, persuades or encourages an inmate of a house of prostitution, or any other place in which prostitution is encouraged or allowed, to remain therein as an inmate; or (e) by fraud or artifice, or by <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"149\">*149</page-number>duress of person or goods, or by abuse of any position of confidence or authority, procures another person for the purpose of prostitution, or to enter any place in which prostitution is encouraged or allowed within this state, or to come into this state or leave this state for the purpose of prostitution; or (f) receives or gives, or agrees to receive or give, any money or thing of value for procuring, or attempting to procure, another person for the purpose of prostitution, or to come into this state or leave this state for the purpose of prostitution,</p>\n</footnote>\n<footnote label=\"4\">\n<p id=\"b139-10\">Section 28, subdivision (f), article I of the California Constitution states in relevant part that \u201c[a]ny prior felony conviction of any person in any criminal proceeding, whether adult or juvenile, shall subsequently be used without limitation for purposes of impeachment or enhancement of sentence in any criminal proceeding.\u201d</p>\n</footnote>\n<footnote label=\"*\">\n<p id=\"b140-7\">See footnote, <em>ante, </em>p. 146.</p>\n</footnote>\n<footnote label=\"*\">\n<p id=\"b141-7\"> Assigned by the Chairperson of the Judicial Council.</p>\n</footnote>\n</opinion>\n</casebody>\n",
