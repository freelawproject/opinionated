Code, \u00a7 300, subd. (a))<footnotemark>1</footnotemark> and (2) minor\u2019s home was an unfit place for her due to the depravity of her father (\u00a7 300, subd. (d)). On March 26, 1984, DSS established a prima facie case for detention and the court placed minor in the sole custody of her mother and ordered no contact with the father.</p>\n<p id=\"b442-4\">On April 16,1984, the juvenile court appointed the Fresno County Public Defender to represent minor\u2019s mother.</p>\n<p id=\"b442-5\">On May 21, 1984, the juvenile court removed the minor from physical custody of her mother and placed minor in a licensed foster home.</p>\n<p id=\"b442-6\">On June 18, 1984, the court returned minor to the custody of her mother and ordered the mother not to discuss the case with the minor.</p>\n<p id=\"b442-7\">On July 18, 1984, the jurisdictional hearing commenced. Following an in camera hearing, the court declared minor was unavailable as a witness(Evid. Code, \u00a7 240).</p>\n<p id=\"b442-8\">On November 27, 1984, the juvenile court found both counts of the petition untrue. Minor\u2019s mother filed a timely notice of appeal. Minor\u2019s father has elected not to become a party or appear in the appeal.</p>\n<p id=\"b442-9\">Facts</p>\n<p id=\"b442-10\"><em>Facts from DSS\u2019 Social </em>Study<footnotemark>2</footnotemark></p>\n<p id=\"b442-11\">Minor was born on November 8, 1979, in Fresno, California. Minor\u2019s mother was a foster child who married at age 16 and gave birth to minor <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"633\">*633</page-number>at age 17. Minor\u2019s father was a Syrian national whose parents lived in Kuwait. Minor\u2019s parents were married in Fresno in 1979 and divorced in April 1982. In February 1983, they entered into a child custody agreement providing for joint custody of the minor. Minor resided in the mother\u2019s Fresno home nine days per month and resided in the father\u2019s Glendale home for the remainder of the month.</p>\n<p id=\"b443-5\">On March 18, 1984, minor\u2019s mother contacted the Fresno Police Department regarding a possible child molestation. Fresno Police Officers Sebastian and Rodriguez responded to her home. The mother told officers her daughter lived with her ex-husband in Glendale for all but nine days out of each month. On Thursday, March 15, 1984, she picked up the child and brought her to Fresno. On Saturday, March 17,1984, minor\u2019s babysitter, Beverly Ann Harkman, advised mother the minor had made statements about being forced to take showers with her father. Minor also told the babysitter her father rubbed her between her legs and it hurt. On Sunday, March 18, 1984, the mother questioned minor about the incident and minor repeated the same statements. The mother then called the Fresno Police Department. Ms. Harkman told officers on Saturday, March 17, she and the minor were driving in a car when the minor talked about taking showers with her father. Minor said she did not like the showers but her father \u201cmade her.\u201d Minor also told the babysitter her father rubbed her between her legs until it hurt. When the babysitter asked minor if the father did anything else, the minor became very embarrassed and stated, \u201cHe touches me here,\u201d and pointed to her buttock. Minor also said she slept with her father in the same bed.</p>\n<p id=\"b443-6\">Minor was very hesitant to talk to the officers about the incident. She told them she had to take showers with her father although she did not want to do so. She also said while she and her father were in the shower, he would rub her between the legs until it hurt. Minor also said father would hit her hard when she did something wrong. When officers asked minor if the father did anything else, she answered, \u201cYes, but I don\u2019t want to tell.\u201d Mother indicated to officers minor did not appear to have any bruises or injuries. However, mother told officers she was going to take the child to her own doctor on March 19 for further examination. The officers advised mother to call Fresno County Child Protective Services for further followup and mother agreed to do so.</p>\n<p id=\"b443-7\">On March 20, 1984, Fresno Police Detectiv\u00e9 D. Krug conducted a followup interview with minor. Minor told Detective Krug when she watched television at her father\u2019s residence, \u201cDaddy Kris\u201d called her into the bathroom. Minor\u2019s father told her to take her clothes off and get into the shower. Minor complied with her father\u2019s request but did not want to do so. Minor <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"634\">*634</page-number>told Detective Krug \u201cDaddy Kris\u201d touched her genital area and buttocks with his hand and inserted his finger into her body. Minor\u2019s mother told Detective Krug minor had a vaginal discharge but no visible injury.</p>\n<p id=\"b444-4\">On March 21, 1984, said minor was examined by John J. McCann, M.D., a resident in pediatric medicine at Valley Medical Center. Dr. McCann had performed examinations on many child sexual abuse victims. Dr. McCann found said minor\u2019s hymen was not intact, both her vagina and anus were dilated (approximately <em>Vi </em>to <em>Vs </em>inch for the vagina; approximately <em>Va </em>to <em>Vs </em>inch for the anus), and this condition was consistent with said minor having been molested and having those areas penetrated by fingers. In a telephone conversation, Dr. McCann was asked if the molestation would have occurred recently or more than a few months ago. In Dr. McCann\u2019s opinion, it was probable the molestation was recent.</p>\n<p id=\"b444-5\">On May 3, 1984, minor\u2019s mother again contacted the Fresno Police Department regarding a possible child molestation. Police Officers Sebastian and Keeney responded to the mother\u2019s apartment. The mother told officers on Tuesday, April 25, 1984, she and the minor went to a therapy session at \u201cAdva-Care.\u201d Therapist Shelia T. Chapital, a psychiatric social worker, showed minor a male doll and a female doll. Minor pulled down the pants of the male doll and placed the female doll\u2019s face between the male doll\u2019s legs. Minor then stated, \u201cThat\u2019s what little girls do.\u201d When minor\u2019s mother questioned her further, minor replied, \u201cThat\u2019s what daddy Peter [mother\u2019s cohabitant/boyfriend] has me do.\u201d Mother later asked minor whether she had ever done anything like that before with Peter and minor replied, \u201cNo.\u201d Mother then asked minor why she made the previous statement. Minor said, \u201cI was making up stories, I meant to change the name to Chris.\u201d \u201cKrisafour\u201d was the name of minor\u2019s father and the mother\u2019s ex-husband. The mother advised Fresno County Child Protective Services of this incident and the latter required a police department report since it was the second incident of possible molestation of the minor.</p>\n<p id=\"b444-6\">\n<em>Facts from the Jurisdictional Hearing</em>\n</p>\n<p id=\"b444-7\">Following an in camera proceeding, the court ruled minor unavailable as a witness at the contested jurisdictional hearing. (Evid. Code, \u00a7 240.) Shelia T. Chapital, a psychiatric social worker at Fresno County Department of Mental Health, testified she counseled minor beginning March 1984. Chap-ital testified minor \u201ctold me that her daddy rubbed her, and that he hurt her . . . and this was in the shower.\u201d Minor also told Chapital, \u201cMy Daddy Kris rubbed me and hurt me.\u201d Minor said \u201cDaddy Kris\u201d would wash her, rub her really hard, hurt her and she would scream. Minor told Chapital on one occasion she was going to sleep on the sofa when \u201cDaddy Kris\u201d picked <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"635\">*635</page-number>her up and said, \u201cLet\u2019s go take a shower.\u201d When minor refused to comply, \u201cDaddy Kris\u201d spanked her, made her cry, and sent her to her room. Minor also told the therapist \u201cDaddy Kris\u201d had \u201cput his finger in her front part and in her back part.\u201d Minor identified the vagina as the \u201cfront part\u201d and the anus as the \u201cback part.\u201d When Chapital asked minor how many times \u201cDaddy Kris\u201d did this, minor held up 10 fingers.</p>\n<p id=\"b445-5\">The parties stipulated Dr. John J. McCann was a medical expert in the examination of sexually abused children. Dr. McCann examined minor on March 21, 1984, and concluded she had been the victim of sexual abuse. Dr. McCann testified minor had an abnormally large vaginal opening, an absent hymen, and a dilated anus. All of these physical findings were compatible with a child who had been sexually molested. The finding of the dilated anus was consistent with repeated penetration.</p>\n<p id=\"b445-6\">Beverly Ann Harkman testified she babysat minor on March 15, 1984. Ms. Harkman overheard minor tell her son the minor showered with her father. Ms. Harkman suggested minor tell her father she can shower herself. Minor responded, \u201cI tell him that I have already had a shower, and I don\u2019t want to but he makes me.\u201d At Ms. Harkman\u2019s request, minor explained how her father bathed her and concluded, \u201cAnd it is so bad.\u201d Ms. Harkman had a second conversation with minor to determine whether she had been sexually abused. Ms. Harkman testified, \u201cI wanted to get further information to rule out the possibility of whether this was a normal shower or an unusual shower.\u201d Minor told Ms. Harkman her father touched her genital area when they showered together. After further questioning, minor told Ms. Harkman she did not want to stay with her father and she was afraid of her father. Ms. Harkman contacted the Fresno Police Department after the second conversation.</p>\n<p id=\"b445-7\">Minor\u2019s father testified he bathed his daughter in the bathtub between June 1983 and March 1984. During that period he would occasionally shower with minor because \u201cshe couldn\u2019t take care of herself by herself. I mean, she couldn\u2019t do it by herself.\u201d Minor never objected to taking a bath by herself or a shower with her father. When father took showers with minor, he only touched her for the purpose of cleaning her. When minor was three and a half years old, she looked at her father \u201cin a funny way,\u201d while they were in the shower together. Father testified, \u201c. . . since that day, it has been about\u2014maybe three times I showered with her. Never without my clothes. Never showered with her again.\u201d Father denied molesting minor. He indicated minor wanted to live with her mother rather than with him because minor\u2019s mother was more permissive with regard to meals, sleep, television, and play.</p>\n<p id=\"b446-3\"><page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"636\">*636</page-number>At the conclusion of the jurisdictional hearing, the court found the allegations of the petition <em>untrue, </em>stating: \u201cIn the Court\u2019s mind a terrible and tragic thing has happened to this little girl. There is no question that she has been sexually molested by somebody. And that alone regardless of who did it to her, it is enough to substantially injure this girl for life unless tremendous care and concern is given by everybody that has anything to do with her.</p>\n<p id=\"b446-4\">\u201cThe question is, of course, the main question before the Court is who did it. And particularly was it [father].</p>\n<p id=\"b446-5\">\u201cThere is abundant evidence before me without even going outside of the Court\u2019s Exhibit Number 1 [DSS report] that [father] was the one who sexually molested her. She is very\u2014the girl in her statements is very particular as to where and when and under what conditions it happened exactly. And yet, this case from the very beginning has been subject to a terrible problem.</p>\n<p id=\"b446-6\">\u201cIn order to identify [father] as the sexual molester, the only\u2014he certainly had access, but he was not entirely alone in that access.</p>\n<p id=\"b446-7\">\u201cThe essential evidence is that supplied by the Court. And the essential evidence comes not from the girl herself, but through hearsay. And that comes because that little girl is not eligible to testify. And it is not the type of hearsay evidence which the Court readily accepts.</p>\n<p id=\"b446-8\">\u201cSuch as spontaneous exclamations and the like. And that is\u2014it is incumbent upon the Court to view such hearsay evidence with the greatest of caution.</p>\n<p id=\"b446-9\">\u201cOne of the things the Court must always consider, has this little girl had time to reflect and make up possibly a false accusation? And that is the defect in this case from the beginning. The answer is yes.</p>\n<p id=\"b446-10\">\u201cI look at the report here. Advocare [sic] therapist going through the play acting, that\u2019s what hit. Daddy Peter asked me to do. Then she says, T was making up stories. That\u2019s really what Chris [sic] did.\u2019</p>\n<p id=\"b446-11\">\u201cRecalling the testimony of Mrs. Chapital where the little girl who Chrissy asked Peter doll copulate with Chrissy Lynne doll? Who is Chrissy Lynne? We don\u2019t know who Chrissy Lynne is. \u2018It is somebody else,\u2019 she says.</p>\n<p id=\"b446-12\">\u201cAnd then Peter pulled the pants down and made Chrissy do this to him.</p>\n<p id=\"b446-13\">\u201cMother doll made Edie do the same thing to Peter. Confusing, isn\u2019t it?</p>\n<p id=\"b447-4\"><page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"637\">*637</page-number>\u201cChrissy Lynne doll, was that you? No, it was my friend.</p>\n<p id=\"b447-5\">\u201cWhen are we to believe her? With a case of this incredible seriousness and the consequences, I think that Mr. Sciandra [father\u2019s counsel] has come right to the problem in the case that makes this little girl\u2019s testimony inherently unreliable.</p>\n<p id=\"b447-6\">\u201cWhen you get\u2014when we have to rely on her and her only\u2014and she accuses others, you have got a problem. Therefore, I find the allegations in this petition not to have been proved beyond by preponderance of evidence. I find them both untrue.\u201d</p>\n<p id=\"b447-7\">Discussion</p>\n<p id=\"b447-8\">I. Did the Juvenile Court Abuse Its Discretion by Limiting the Participation of the Mother\u2019s Attorney in the Proceedings?<footnotemark>*</footnotemark></p>\n<p id=\"b447-9\">II. Did the Juvenile Court Abuse Its Discretion in Dismissing</p>\n<p id=\"b447-10\">the Petition?</p>\n<p id=\"b447-11\">Minor\u2019s mother and DSS contend the juvenile court abused its discretion in dismissing the dependency petition.</p>\n<p id=\"b447-12\">Minor\u2019s mother and DSS do not expressly attack the sufficiency of the evidence to support the juvenile court\u2019s ruling. Rather, they contend: (1) the court found minor was sexually abused by a third party; (2) this finding activated statutory presumptions that minor was in need of proper and effective parental care (\u00a7 355.1), that she had been neglected (\u00a7 355.2), and that her home was an unfit place for her by reason of physical abuse (\u00a7 355.4); (3) activation of these presumptions created a prima facie case for dependency and shifted the burden of producing evidence to the parents (\u00a7 355.6); (4) during the contested jurisdictional hearing, each of minor\u2019s parents unsuccessfully attempted to establish the abuse occurred in the home of the other parent; and (5) because neither parent overcame the presumptions <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"638\">*638</page-number>by a preponderance of the evidence, the court abused its discretion in dismissing the petition.<footnotemark>3</footnotemark></p>\n<p id=\"b448-4\">A dependency hearing conducted under section 300 involves two distinct issues to be addressed by the juvenile court. First, at the jurisdictional hearing, the court must decide whether the minor comes within one of the categories specified in section 300. (\u00a7 355.) If the court decides this issue in the affirmative, the court may invoke its jurisdiction to declare the minor a dependent child of the court. Second, at the dispositional hearing, the court must decide the appropriate disposition of the minor. (\u00a7\u00a7 356, 358.) The court will hear evidence to determine disposition, which may range from supervised custody (\u00a7 362) to removal of the child from the home. (\u00a7 361.) The court\u2019s principal concern is a disposition consistent with the best interests of the minor. <em>(Collins </em>v. <em>Superior Court </em>(1977) 74 Cal.App.3d 47, 52 [141 Cal.Rptr. 273].)</p>\n<p id=\"b448-5\">At the dispositional hearing, proof by a preponderance of evidence is sufficient unless the court awards custody to a nonparent. (Evid. Code, \u00a7 115.) The more stringent standard of proof by clear and convincing evidence only applies if a child is removed from his or her home and custody is awarded to a nonparent. (\u00a7 361, subd. (b); Civ. Code, \u00a7 4600.) After hearing the evidence, the court must make a finding, noted in the minutes of the court, whether or not the minor is a person described by section 300. If it finds the minor is not such a person, it must order the petition dismissed and the minor discharged from any detention or restriction previously ordered. (\u00a7 356.)</p>\n<p id=\"b448-6\">On appeal from a juvenile court order in a dependency hearing, an appellate court\u2019s review of the sufficiency of the evidence to support the <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"639\">*639</page-number>judgment is limited to whether the judgment is supported by substantial evidence. Issues of fact and credibility are questions for the trial court and not the reviewing court. The power of the appellate court begins and ends with a determination as to whether there is any substantial evidence, contradicted or uncontradicted, which will support the conclusion reached by the trier of fact. The role of the reviewing court is not to reverse judgments where they may have been based in part on excludable evidence. Rather, the duty of the reviewing court is to strip away the inadmissible evidence and ask whether enough admissible evidence remains to sustain the court\u2019s finding. <em>(In re Cheryl H. </em>(1984) 153 Cal.App.3d 1098, 1132-1133 [200 Cal.Rptr. 789].)</p>\n<p id=\"b449-5\">We will find the trial court did err in dismissing the dependency petition and the judgment must be reversed and remanded for further dispositional proceedings.</p>\n<p id=\"b449-6\">The petition alleged the minor came within the provisions of section 300, subdivisions (a) and (d) and should be adjudged a dependent child of the court. Section 300 provides in pertinent part: \u201cAny person under the age of 18 years who comes within any of the following descriptions is within the jurisdiction of the juvenile court which may adjudge that person to be a dependent child of the court:</p>\n<blockquote id=\"b449-7\">\u201c(a) Who is in need of proper and effective parental care or control and has no parent or guardian, or has no parent or guardian willing to exercise or capable of exercising care or control, or has no parent or guardian actually exercising care or control.</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b449-8\">\u201c(d) Whose home is an unfit place for him or her by reason of neglect, cruelty, depravity, or physical abuse of either of his or her parents, or of his or her guardian or other person in whose custody or care he or she is.\u201d</blockquote>\n<p id=\"b449-9\">The trial court found the petition <em>untrue, </em>stating: \u201cIn the Court\u2019s mind a terrible and tragic thing has happened to this little girl. There is no question that she has been sexually molested by somebody. And that alone regardless of who did it to her, it is enough to substantially injure this girl for life unless tremendous care and concern is given by everybody that has anything to do with her.</p>\n<p id=\"b449-10\">\u201cThe question is, of course, the main question before the Court is who did it. And particularly was it [father].\u201d The court then proceeded to analyze and weigh the evidence not of whether the minor was molested (this the <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"640\">*640</page-number>court conceded) but, rather, whether the molester was the father, the boyfriend, both of them, or possibly some unidentified person. The court concluded the evidence was insufficient to prove the identity of the culprit and, therefore, found the allegations untrue and dismissed the petition. In our view, the trial court erred as a matter of law.</p>\n<p id=\"b450-4\">The trial court was presented with two basic questions by the allegations in the petition. First, was the minor a person who came within the definition of section 300, subdivision (a) and/or subdivision (d) and, thus, should be adjudged a dependent child of the court? Second, if the minor was such a person, what disposition was in the best interest of the dependent child? As previously stated, the juvenile court judge concluded \u201ca terrible and tragic thing has happened to this little girl. <em>There is no question </em>that she has been sexually molested by somebody.\u201d (Italics added.)  Thereafter, the court never equivocated about, modified or revised this conclusion. Rather, the court only addressed the further question of who was the molester. The court therefore clearly found the minor to be one who is in need of proper and effective parental care or control and has no parent willing to exercise or capable of exercising or actually exercising care or control (\u00a7 300, subd. (a)), and the minor\u2019s home is an unfit place for her by reason of neglect, cruelty, depravity or physical abuse of either of her parents. (\u00a7 300, subd. (d).) In other words, the court found by definition of law the minor was a person who came within the provisions of section 300. However, it appears the trial court mistakenly believed it must also find, or be able to find from the evidence, who specifically was sexually abusing the child, before it could find the allegations of the petition to be true. We cannot agree. The only significance in this proceeding (as opposed to a criminal proceeding, for example) as to who was in fact sexually abusing Christina, was the help and guidance this fact would lend to the court in fashioning an appropriate order in the best interest of the dependent child, i.e., whether the child should be removed from the home of one or the other or both of the parents, placed in a foster home, what access to the child or visitation should be allowed, the scope of DSS supervision, and the like.</p>\n<p id=\"b450-5\">We conclude the trial court erred as a matter of law in dismissing the petition and, as we have stated, the matter is remanded for further dispositional proceedings in the lower court.</p>\n<p id=\"b450-6\">III.-VI.<footnotemark>*</footnotemark></p>\n<p id=\"b451-4\"><page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"641\">*641</page-number>The judgment is reversed.</p>\n<p id=\"b451-5\">Franson, Acting P. J., and Ballantyne, J., concurred.</p>\n<footnote label=\"1\">\n<p id=\"b442-12\">All further statutory references are to the Welfare and Institutions Code unless otherwise specified.</p>\n</footnote>\n<footnote label=\"2\">\n<p id=\"b442-13\">\u201cPrior to the jurisdictional hearing, the social worker generally prepares an extensive report called the social study.</p>\n<p id=\"b442-14\">\u201cThe social study report typically contains hearsay. Nevertheless, California Rules of Court, rule 1365(d) specifically permits admission of the social study, or other report of the social worker containing relevant and material information, to be admitted in evidence at the jurisdictional hearing on condition that, if requested by the parent or guardian, the social worker is made available for cross-examination regarding the contents of the report. In addition, W &amp; I C section 281 specifically authorizes the trial court to receive and consider the reports and recommendations of the social worker in any matter involving the custody, status, or welfare of a child.</p>\n<p id=\"b442-15\">\u201cThus, although it contains hearsay, the social study has routinely been admitted in evidence at the jurisdictional hearing, and read and considered by the court prior to making its jurisdictional finding. [Citations omitted.]\u201d (Cal. Family Law Service (1986) Juvenile Court Dependency Proceedings, \u00a7 59:59, pp. 224-225.)</p>\n</footnote>\n<footnote label=\"*\">\n<p id=\"b447-13\">See footnote, <em>ante, </em>page 630.</p>\n</footnote>\n<footnote label=\"3\">\n<p id=\"b448-7\">The Welfare and Institutions Code contains four presumptions available to the petitioner at a jurisdictional hearing to ease the burden of proving a prima facie case. (\u00a7\u00a7 355.1-355.4.) Section 355.1 creates a presumption as to the child\u2019s need of proper and effective parental care. Section 355.2 creates a presumption the child\u2019s home is unfit by virtue of neglect. Section 355.3 creates a presumption the child\u2019s home is unfit by virtue of cruelty. Section 355.4 creates a presumption the child\u2019s home is unfit by virtue of physical abuse. These presumptions arise on the finding, based on competent evidence, the child has sustained an injury or detrimental condition that would not ordinarily be sustained except as the result of unreasonable or neglectful acts or omissions by either parent, a guardian, or another person having care and custody of the child. Such evidence is prima facie evidence the child is described by section 300, subdivision (a) or by subdivision (d). As such, the evidence is sufficient to support a finding the juvenile court has jurisdiction over the child. The presumptions are rebuttable and affect only the burden of producing evidence. (\u00a7 355.6.) If the parent or guardian presents rebuttal evidence as to how the injury actually occurred or as to the fitness of the child\u2019s home, the presumptions have no further effect.
