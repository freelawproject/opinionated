J.</author>\n<p id=\"AE7\">Manuel Julian Albitre appeals from the judgment entered upon his plea of guilty to causing bodily injury while driving under the influence of alcohol and drugs (Veh. Code, \u00a7 23153, subd. (a)), with true findings, made after a court trial as to one prior conviction for driving under the influence of drugs or alcohol and appellant\u2019s admission to another prior conviction for that offense, that appellant had two prior convictions of section 23152 (Veh. Code, \u00a7 23190.)<footnotemark>1</footnotemark> He contends that the contested \u201cPrior Offense No. 2\u201d which resulted in his conviction on September 21, 1984, could not be properly used to punish him as a third-time offender, since on the date he committed the present offense, September 7, 1984, a conviction of \u201cPrior Offense No. 2\u201d had not yet been entered.<footnotemark>2</footnotemark></p>\n<p id=\"b538-10\">In the present matter, appellant was charged in the information with a September 7, 1984, violation of Vehicle Code section 23153, subdivisions <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"897\">*897</page-number>(a) and (b). The People also sought a sentence enhancement pursuant to former Vehicle Code section 23190 (Stats. 1982, ch. 1339, \u00a7 27) on the ground that appellant was a third-time offender. It was alleged that appellant had committed \u201cPrior Offense No. 1\u201d on December 18, 1982, a section 23152, subdivision (a), offense for which a judgment of conviction was entered on January 4, 1984. It was further alleged that appellant had also committed, \u201cPrior Offense No. 2\u201d on December 20, 1983, a section 23152, subdivision (b), offense for which a judgment of conviction was entered on September 21, 1984.</p>\n<p id=\"b539-5\">On April 25, 1985, appellant entered a plea of guilty to section 23153, subdivision (a), and admitted that \u201cPrior Offense No. 1\u201d was true. As to \u201cPrior Offense No. 2,\u201d he waived jury trial and, on April 29, 1985, in a court trial, the second prior offense was found true. In the trial, the court rejected appellant\u2019s claim that the \u201cprior offenses which resulted in convictions\u201d described in section 23190 are limited to those offenses in which a conviction was entered before the commission of the present offense. In rejecting appellant\u2019s assertion, the trial court reasoned that since appellant committed prior offense No. 2 before he committed the present offense and his conviction of prior offense No. 2 occurred before appellant was convicted of the present offense, prior No. 2 satisfied the criteria of the section. The trial court then examined the factual basis for appellant\u2019s admission of the first prior conviction and found it to be true. Appellant was sentenced, in conformity with the enhanced provisions of section 23190, to a three-year midterm in state prison.<footnotemark>3</footnotemark></p>\n<p id=\"b539-6\">Appellant\u2019s contention is unavailing. When appellant committed the present 1984 offense, section 23190 provided for enhanced punishment \u201c[i]f any person is convicted of a violation of Section 23153 and <em>the offense occurred within five years of two or more prior offenses which resulted in convictions. . . </em>.\u201d The language of section 23190 is clear and unambiguous. Its plain meaning is that the word \u201cprior\u201d defines the timing of the offenses which trigger enhanced punishment and not the timing of the conviction of the prior offense. Given the location of the word \u201cprior\u201d and of the phrase \u201cwhich resulted in convictions\u201d in the statute, it is manifest that the Legislature intended that convictions be used only as a mechanism for easily and reliably establishing at trial the truth of the prior offense. Consequently, a conviction for \u201cPrior Offense No. 2\u201d need not be entered prior to commission of the present offense before that prior offense may be utilized to enhance punishment under the provisions of section 23190. <em>(People </em>v. <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"898\">*898</page-number><em>Weidert </em>(1985) 39 Cal.3d 836, 843 [218 Cal.Rptr. 57, 705 P.2d 380]; cf. <em>People </em>v. <em>Balderas </em>(1985) 41 Cal.3d 144, 201-204 [222 Cal.Rptr. 184, 711 P.2d 480].)</p>\n<p id=\"b540-4\">The judgment is affirmed.</p>\n<p id=\"b540-5\">Gilbert, J., and Abbe, J., concurred.</p>\n<footnote label=\"1\">\n<p id=\"b538-11\">All statutory references are to the Vehicle Code unless otherwise stated,</p>\n</footnote>\n<footnote label=\"2\">\n<p id=\"Axf\">Initially, appellate counsel filed a <em>Wende </em>brief. <em>(People </em>v. <em>Wende </em>(1979) 25 Cal.3d 436 [158 Cal.Rptr. 839, 600 P.2d 1071].)
