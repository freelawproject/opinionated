The demand was made on the 31st day of July, 1849, and then the cause of action accrued. If he held it in trust, it matters not for whom it was held; the cause of action did not accrue until the demand.</p>\n<p data-order=\"48\" data-type=\"legal\" id=\"b421-13\">But however this may be, the case comes within the saving clause of the statute, which expressly saves the rights of married women till after the disability be removed. Act of June 16, 1791, N. H. Laws, Ed. of 1815, p. 165, \u00a7 4; Act of June 30th, 1825; N. H. Laws, 1829, p. 77, \u00a7 2; Rev. Stat., chap. 181, \u00a7 8.</p>\n<p data-order=\"49\" data-type=\"legal\" id=\"b421-14\">The suit, though in the name of the husband and wife, is the suit of the wife, and the fact that she must by law join him, does not affect this clause in the statute of limitations. It is so in all civil actions, and yet the right of the wife is saved. In <em>Watson </em>v. <em>Watson, </em>10 Conn. Rep. 75, it was held that the right of the wife was not barred by fifteen years\u2019 adverse possession during the coverture, and this is an action brought by husband and wife. <em>Jackson </em>v. <em>Sellick, </em>8 Johns. Rep. 262; <em>Caldwell </em>v. <em>Black, </em>5 Iredell\u2019s Rep. 463.</p>\n<p data-order=\"50\" data-type=\"legal\" id=\"b421-15\">The offer of the defendant was to show an assignment by <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"422\">*422</page-number>Daniel Pierce, the husband, of all the interest that accrued to him in right of his wife by the will of her father, and that the defendant appropriated the sum received for the support of Pierce and his family.</p>\n<p data-order=\"51\" data-type=\"legal\" id=\"b422-5\">Waiving the question whether Pierce undertook to assign the interest of his wife at all, we say he had no power over the legacy whatever; that it was bequeathed to the wife for her sole and separate use. This is directly settled in <em>Judge of Probate </em>v. <em>Hardy, </em>8 N. H. Rep. 147. In that case this very clause in the will was drawn in question.</p>\n<p data-order=\"52\" data-type=\"legal\" id=\"b422-6\">The will gives a sum of money to Clarissa Pierce, wife of Daniel Pierce, during her natural life, for her use and improvement. And in another part of the will it is provided that the sum intended for the said Clarissa, she is to have the use and improvement of during her natural life.</p>\n<p data-order=\"53\" data-type=\"legal\" id=\"b422-7\">The only question is one of intent. Did the testator intend to give it to her for her sole and separate use ? On this point there is no room to doubt. It is given to her during her natural life, and then to her children. Many cases are cited in Clancy on Husband and Wife, p. 262, where it was held that the wife took a separate estate, upon the strength of provisions much less explicit than in this case, and fully sustain <em>Judge of Probate </em>v. <em>Hardy. </em>The intent is to govern, although the language be not strictly technical.</p>\n<p data-order=\"54\" data-type=\"legal\" id=\"b422-8\">When, however, one clause of a will makes a bequest to a married woman for her sole and separate use, in language that is strictly technical, the omission to use it in another clause has been held to justify the construction that the latter bequest was not to her sole use ; and this upon the ground that the testator knew what technical language would give a separate estate, and would have used it had it been his purpose so to bequeath his property. Cases cited in Clancy 268. The inclination of courts and the course of legislation in this State have been to favor and protect the rights of married women.</p>\n<attorneys data-order=\"55\" data-type=\"attorneys\" id=\"b422-9\"><em>Fowler, </em>for the defendant.</attorneys>\n<p data-order=\"56\" data-type=\"legal\" id=\"b423-4\"><page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"423\">*423</page-number>1st. The statute of limitations was a bar to this suit. The last interest received by the defendant was on the 4th of January, 1843; more than six years before the commencement of this action. The defendant having received the money of another, if he received it wrongfully was liable to an action to recover it back immediately. The statute, therefore, commenced running as to each annual payment of interest from the moment when the defendant received it; that is, from the moment when the defendant was liable to be sued for that instalment, which was the very next moment after he had wrongfully received it into his possession. Angell on Limitations 41; Evans\u2019 Pothier 404; Story\u2019s Equity 1521, a.</p>\n<p data-order=\"57\" data-type=\"legal\" id=\"b423-5\">The statute must then be a bar to the action, unless there is something in the second replication that one of the plaintiffs was <em>feme covert </em>at the time the cause of action accrued, and so continued until within six years before the commencement of this suit. Now it seems to us that the case itself furnishes sufficient answer to this allegation. The suit is brought by the husband and wife to recover money received thirty years ago. The plaintiffs were married long before that time, and have so continued ever since. They had the same capacity thirty years ago to sue that they now have. No disability to bring this action has ever existed. The parti\u00e9s plaintiff have always been in a condition to bring this action legally and properly, from the moment when the first instalment of interest was received.</p>\n<p data-order=\"58\" data-type=\"legal\" id=\"b423-6\">There has always been a person \u2014 the present plaintiffs \u2014 in existence who might properly have instituted a suit. The statute must therefore run against the claim which they have set up to recover what they might have recovered thirty years ago. Angell on Limitations 55; <em>Murrey </em>v. <em>East India Co., </em>5 Barn. &amp; Ald. 204.</p>\n<p data-order=\"59\" data-type=\"legal\" id=\"b423-7\">2d. If not barred by the statute of limitations, the defence offered to this suit by the defendant, and rejected by the auditor, was a valid and sufficient one, and should have been received.</p>\n<p data-order=\"60\" data-type=\"legal\" id=\"b423-8\">If the annual interest upon this legacy belonged to the wife, it was competent for the husband to assign it to the defendant, <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"424\">*424</page-number>as he did by his deed of September 8, 1820, and such assignment transferred the same to the defendant absolutely.</p>\n<p data-order=\"61\" data-type=\"legal\" id=\"b424-5\">As to the wife\u2019s choses in action, the husband has power to sue for and recover, or release or assign them. 2 Kent\u2019s Com. 185. The rule is the same if a legacy or distributive share accrues to the wife during coverture. 2 Kent\u2019s Com. 135; <em>Garforth </em>v. <em>Bradley, </em>2 Vesey, sen. 675; 5 Johns. Chan. 196; <em>Howland </em>v. <em>Bloom, </em>6 Johns. Chan. 178; <em>Carr </em>v. <em>Taylor, </em>10 Vesey 178; <em>Wildman </em>v. <em>Wildman, </em>9 Vesey 174.</p>\n<p data-order=\"62\" data-type=\"legal\" id=\"b424-6\">The husband may release his wife\u2019s choses in action, even those in remainder or expectancy, which may possibly fall in during the marriage. Roper on Husband and Wife 227, 237.</p>\n<p data-order=\"63\" data-type=\"legal\" id=\"b424-7\">In <em>Tucker </em>v. <em>Gordon, </em>5 N. H. Rep. 564, the superior court of this State say: \u201c It seems to be settled in general, that a husband has the control of a legacy given to his wife. He <em>m&amp;j-</em>release or assign it by a deed or other instrument to which she is not a party, and payment to her is no bar to the action brought by him.\u201d See, also, <em>Udall </em>v. <em>Kenney, </em>3 Cowen\u2019s Rep. 590; Bingham on Coverture 216; 4 Burns\u2019 Ecclesiastical Law 319; Lovelass on Wills 247, 248.</p>\n<p data-order=\"64\" data-type=\"legal\" id=\"b424-8\">The same doctrine is reiterated by <em>Parker, </em>C. J., in <em>Parsons </em>v. <em>Parsons &amp; Gilman, </em>9 N. H. Rep. 309, 321, where he says that a husband may release or assign a legacy to, or the distributive share of his wife in an estate, for a valuable consideration, and by a deed to which she is not a party.</p>\n<p data-order=\"65\" data-type=\"legal\" id=\"b424-9\">Again, the doctrine is well settled that if a husband reduce a legacy payable to his wife to possession, it becomes absolutely his own. <em>Parsons </em>v. <em>Parsons &amp; al., </em>9 N. H. Rep. 321; 2 Story\u2019s Equity 631; Clancy\u2019s Rights of Husband and Wife 111.</p>\n<p data-order=\"66\" data-type=\"legal\" id=\"b424-10\">Now in this case, by the deed of September 8, 1820, Pierce constituted the defendant his attorney, irrevocable, to receive this legacy payable annually to his wife. Under that authority the defendant acted; and his reduction of this legacy to his possession was the act of Pierce; and its possession by the defendant was the possession of the husband; and by such reducing to the possession of the defendant the legacy became as absolutely the <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"425\">*425</page-number>property of Pierce as if he had taken the money with his own hands, and he can no more legally sustain this action to recover the money from the defendant, as the property of his wife, than he could have sustained an action against himself for the same object.</p>\n<p data-order=\"67\" data-type=\"legal\" id=\"b425-5\">Again, the husband brings this suit. It could not be brought by the wife alone. The defendant proposed to show that it could not be sustained, because the husband himself had sold and assigned to him the debt claimed to be recovered. The decision of the auditor, excluding this evidence, as also the evidence showing the manner in which the money had been applied, involves the absurdity of saying, that if the defendant ever had the money claimed, no matter how fairly he purchased and paid for it, or how honestly he has applied it, he shall now be compelled to pay it back again.</p>\n<opinion data-order=\"68\" data-type=\"opinion\" id=\"x999-1\" type=\"majority\">\n<author id=\"b425-6\">Eastman, J.</author>\n<p id=\"Aeq\">The will of Jonathan Hardy, and particularly those clauses of it upon which the decision of this ease rests, have heretofore undergone \u00e1 judicial construction in the superior court of this State, in the case of <em>Judge of Probate </em>v. Hardy, 3 N. H. Rep. 147. In that case <em>Richardson, </em>C. J., says: \u201c We think that it was the intent of the testator that this sum should be reserved for the use of Clarissa and her children, and that the husband of Clarissa should have no control over it.\u201d And again: \u201c This will seems to us to give to Clarissa the right to receive only the interest of. this legacy.\u201d It was also there held that the executor was by law the trustee of the fund; that it should be kept by him, and the interest be paid over to her as it should fall due.</p>\n<p id=\"b425-7\">In the case of <em>Parsons </em>v. <em>Parsons al., </em>9 N. H. Rep. 321, <em>Parker, </em>C. J., has stated the law, and collected the authorities in regard to the rights of a husband over the distributive share or legacy of the wife; and he states it thus: \u201c Neither a legacy to a wife, nor a distributive share in an estate in which she is interested, vests in the husband absolutely. They are not like her personal property in possession, which become absolutely his. <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"426\">*426</page-number>But they are classed with and sometimes called her choses in action. If the husband reduce them to possession, as he may, they become absolutely his own. And he may release them or assign them for a valuable consideration, and by a deed to which she is not a party. But until he has reduced them into possession, or in some other way barred her right, he has only a qualifying interest, and if he die first the right survives to her. And possession by the husband as executor and trustee, is not a sufficient reduction into possession to bar her of her right. If, however, he survive his wife, he is entitled to administration, and to recover and receive them to his own use.\u201d See also <em>Marston </em>v. Carter, 12 N. H. Rep. 159.</p>\n<p id=\"b426-5\">Upon this doctrine it will be apparent that should we hold that the legacy was given to the wife of Pierce, generally, without restriction, that her husband could reduce the same into possession, or bar her right thereto by assignment. But without going into any discussion as to the meaning of the will, it is sufficient to say that we feel bound by the construction that was given to it in the case of <em>Judge of Probate </em>v. <em>Hardy; </em>and by that construction the husband could not assign the <em>legacy. </em>He had no control over it, or its income, until actually in his possession.</p>\n<p id=\"b426-6\">Adhering to the construction given to the will in that case, it becomes unnecessary for us to determine how far the assignment made by Pierce <em>to </em>the defendant would avail, if Pierce had the right to make it. Having no right to make it, the assignment is void.</p>\n<p id=\"b426-7\">But there is another question raised in this case, which is presented by the demurrer to the replication to the plea of the statute of limitations. The money claimed of the defendant was all received by him more than six years before the commencement of this suit, and unless the disability of the wife is a sufficient answer to the plea of the statute, the action must fail.</p>\n<p id=\"b426-8\">The provision of our statute by which the rights of infants, feme <em>coverts </em>and insane persons are saved, is believed to be universally common to statutes of limitations. As a general rule, the statute does not run so long as the disability continues, and <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"427\">*427</page-number>the rights of a <em>feme covert </em>are not prejudiced during her incapacity to institute a suit therefor. And such was the fact in this case. The plaintiff, Clarissa Pierce, was under coverture prior to the reception of any of the money'by the defendant, and for aught that appears still remains so. According to the construction given to the will, the right to the income of the legacy was her sole right, one over which her husband had no control; but still, one which she could not enforce in her individual name and capacity during coverture. It was therefore a right which was saved by the statute so long as the disability should continue.</p>\n<p id=\"b427-5\">It is no sufficient answer to this position, to say that the husband and wife could have instituted the suit at any time. The fact that it might be done, does not prove that it necessarily must be done to save the statute and her rights. The right was in her; the reservation of the statute is for her benefit, and until she had personally the power to institute the suit, the statute would not run against her. To test the principle: Suppose the hrfsband to have died a month before the suit was commenced, and that it had been brought in her name; it would hardly be contended that the statute of limitations could be successfully interposed to such suit by her. The disability of coverture would not be removed until the death of the husband, and the statute would not begin to run till then; and because the husband could unite with his wife and bring the suit, her powers and her rights would not be abridged thereby.</p>\n<p id=\"b427-6\">This suit is instituted for the benefit of the wife, in the name of the husband and wife; for she has no legal existence that will enable her to bring a suit in her own name during the coverture. And such a suit may be brought during the continuance of the wife\u2019s disability to maintain a sole suit. <em>Watson </em>v. <em>Watson, </em>10 Conn. Rep. 77; <em>Leighton </em>v. <em>The State, </em>4 Harrington\u2019s Rep. 8; <em>Stuart </em>v. <em>Kissam, </em>2 Barb. Sup. Ct. Rep. 493.</p>\n<p id=\"b427-7\">We see no objection to the allowance of interest upon the sums as they were received. The defendant has had the use of the money, and the wife was not in a situation to make any legal demand or institute any suit for the same.</p>\n<p id=\"b428-4\"><page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"428\">*428</page-number>Neither can the set-off he allowed. The defendant has no canse of action against the wife therefor. The credit was given to the husband, and the charges were made against him. If a demand against the husband could be set off against the wife\u2019s claim for the income of the legacy, then would the object of the will be defeated, as the income would thus be indirectly appropriated by the husband. The disallowance of the set-off may seem to be a hardship upon the defendant.
