H. Militia, at Gilmanton.</summary>\n<summary data-order=\"14\" data-type=\"summary\" id=\"b109-7\"><em>\u201c </em>Ordered, that all persons liable to do military duty, living on the hundred acre lots in Barnstead, except one range on the northeasterly end of said lots, shall constitute the second company of Infantry. The remaining part of said town shall constitute the sixth company of Infantry. Captains John H. Collins and Thomas P. Hodgdon will take notice of the above, and govern themselves accordingly.</summary>\n<summary data-order=\"15\" data-type=\"summary\" id=\"b109-8\"><em>\u201c </em>March 21,1826. \u25a0 Signed, Nicholas Durrell,</summary>\n<summary data-order=\"16\" data-type=\"summary\" id=\"b109-9\">Nathaniel Gilman,</summary>\n<summary data-order=\"17\" data-type=\"summary\" id=\"b109-10\">James S.

To prove the book to be that of the company, the plaintiff was permitted to testify, subject to the defendant\u2019s exception on account of his liability for costs in this action, and being party to the record. This record did not show the order to be that of the Field Officers, but was what purported to be an order from some source, fixing the limits as above.</summary>\n<summary data-order=\"22\" data-type=\"summary\" id=\"b109-15\">To show said Cate to be second sergeant of the company, the orderly book was produced, wherein was recorded a sergeant\u2019s warrant in due form, dated May 9th, 1848, and sworn to.</summary>\n<summary data-order=\"23\" data-type=\"summary\" id=\"b109-16\">An original warrant was also produced, of the same date, but <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"110\">*110</page-number>not countersigned by the clerk, nor was there any date to the administration of the oath. This evidence was excepted to as not showing said Cate to be sergeant.</summary>\n<summary data-order=\"24\" data-type=\"summary\" id=\"b110-5\">In the same book was recorded the company order, dated 7th September, 1848, directed to said Cate as sergeant, ordering him to notify the said Nutter and others, to appear on parade on the 15th of September, and also on said 1,8th of September, at the Regimental muster. There was also the' record of service upon Nutter, on the 11th of September, duly sworn to, and a record of the roll of delinquents on said 18th, and among them the said Nutter. In addition to the exception already taken, that this book was proved by Cate, an interested witness, as alleged, the defendant took the further exception, that.these records were not the competent evidence to prove the fact. The plaintiff also proved by parol that Nutter did not do military duty on the 18th of September. To which exception was taken. Other evidence was introduced by the plaintiff to make out his case, which was not excepted to.</summary>\n<summary data-order=\"25\" data-type=\"summary\" id=\"b110-6\">The defendant then offered to show, by the original paper issued by the captain, that the records of \u00abthe orderly books above set forth were false in two respects. First, that the captain made out the company order of the 7th of September, to warn the men to appear on the 15th, and signed it; that there was then interlined, under his name, the order to warn them to appear on the 18th, and that was not signed or dated. Second, that the only notice given to Nutter to appear on the 18th, was as follows: \u201c Also to appear on Monday, the 18th day of September, near John Gale\u2019s dwelling house, in Gilmanton, at precisely six o\u2019clock, A. M., armed and equipped as the law requires for military inspection and review, and there await further orders. Dated at Barnstead, on Saturday, the 9th day of September, 1848. Signed, Edwin Cate, Sergeant.\u201d</summary>\n<summary data-order=\"26\" data-type=\"summary\" id=\"b110-7\">And that said notice had no direction whatever, but was delivered to the defendant at the same time a notice was given him to appear on the 15th.</summary>\n<summary data-order=\"27\" data-type=\"summary\" id=\"b110-8\">The court ruled the evidence inadmissible. A verdict was <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"111\">*111</page-number>thereupon taken by consent for the plaintiff, on which judgment was to be entered, or the verdict set aside and a new trial granted, as the opinion of this court should be upon the whole case.</summary>\n<attorneys data-order=\"28\" data-type=\"attorneys\" id=\"b111-5\"><em>Hobbs </em>Sariborn, for the defendant.</attorneys>\n<p data-order=\"29\" data-type=\"legal\" id=\"b111-6\">The companies are not limited by geographical boundaries. <em>Jones </em>v. <em>French, </em>2 Foster\u2019s Rep. 64; Perry v. Dover, 12 Pick. 206.</p>\n<p data-order=\"30\" data-type=\"legal\" id=\"b111-7\">The limits should be such that they could be understood and readily ascertained by every person liable to do military duty.</p>\n<p data-order=\"31\" data-type=\"legal\" id=\"b111-8\">Such is not the fact in the case at bar.</p>\n<p data-order=\"32\" data-type=\"legal\" id=\"b111-9\">The limits should be defined by monuments on the ground.</p>\n<p data-order=\"33\" data-type=\"legal\" id=\"b111-10\">Previous to the act of Jan. 2, 1829, N. H. Laws, 387, sec. 14, (Ed. 1830,) adjutants were not required or authorized to make any record of the limits of companies, or furnish to the captains of the several companies copies of orders made by the field officers limiting companies. See N. H. Laws, 1824, (Hill\u2019s Ed.) p. 63, \u00a7 19, and p. 87, \u00a7 5.</p>\n<p data-order=\"34\" data-type=\"legal\" id=\"b111-11\">The writing in the adjutant\u2019s book had not even the force of secondary evidence, and was wholly inadmissible.</p>\n<p data-order=\"35\" data-type=\"legal\" id=\"b111-12\">The entry in the company book was wholly inadmissible, because it did not appear that the order was issued by any authority whatever.,</p>\n<p data-order=\"36\" data-type=\"legal\" id=\"b111-13\">Cate being liable for costs, could not be admitted to testify to a particular fact. <em>Bowman </em>v. <em>Noyes, </em>12 N. H. Rep. 313; <em>Pudor </em>v. <em>Boston Maine R. R., </em>26 Maine Rep. 458.</p>\n<p data-order=\"37\" data-type=\"legal\" id=\"b111-14\">The warrant was not countersigned by the clerk, as required by law, and was no evidence of his appointment. Rev. Stat., chap. 93, \u00a7 8.</p>\n<p data-order=\"38\" data-type=\"legal\" id=\"b111-15\">It was competent for the defendant to show, by. the original order and return, which was the evidence offered, that the record was false. The original order and return are made admissible for the plaintiff, and therefore for the defendant. Rev. Stat., chap. 78, \u00a7 3.</p>\n<attorneys data-order=\"39\" data-type=\"attorneys\" id=\"b111-16\"><em>Butters, </em>for the plaintiff.</attorneys>\n<opinion data-order=\"40\" data-type=\"opinion\" id=\"x999-1\" type=\"majority\">\n<author id=\"b112-4\"><page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"112\">*112</page-number>Woods, J.</author>\n<p id=\"A-o\">The objection that the company book of records was not competent evidence of the issuing of the company order, and of the service of the notice upon the defendant, cannot be sustained. The statute makes a copy of the record of such order, and of the return, under oath, of the sergeant or private thereon, who may have delivered the notice to the party warned, certified by the clerk, competent evidence of \u201c due notice of enrolment and of such parade.\u201d Rev. Stat., chap. 78, \u00a7 3.</p>\n<p id=\"b112-5\">By the statute, also, it is made the duty of the clerk of a company to keep an orderly book, and to record therein all orders and official communications received or issued by his commanding officer. Rev. Stat., chap. 89, \u00a7 1. And it has been decided by this court, that a copy of record, certified by the clerk, of any order received or issued by the captain, is, upon general principles, admissible in evidence upon the trial of a prosecution for a military fine. <em>State </em>v. <em>Wilson, </em>7 N. H. Rep. 543.</p>\n<p id=\"b112-6\">If the copy of the record be competent evidence of the facts in question, the original record cannot be regarded as evidence of a less satisfactory or less authentic character. <em>Jones </em>v. <em>French, </em>2 Foster\u2019s Rep. 64. The roll of delinquents in the orderly book kept by the clerk, is made, by express statute, evidence of the delinquency of the party. Rev. Stat., chap. 82, \u00a7 1. And by the same section, other evidence relating thereto is admissible ; and we think parol evidence is included in the provision. But we are not aware that the records of the clerk are conclusive evidence of the facts recorded. And we are of opinion, that, although the record is <em>prima fade </em>evidence of the facts contained in it, nevertheless, the original order, offered in evidence, was admissible also, for the purpose of rebutting the evidence afforded by the record; or, in other words, of impeaching it, to the extent, at least, of showing that the record is not a correct copy of the original. The original order of the captain to the clerk must afford evidence of its own contents, of as high and conclusive a character, at least, as the record of it.</p>\n<p id=\"b112-7\">No doubt is entertained that it was competent for the defendant to have shown the form and character of the notice that <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"113\">*113</page-number>was served upon him., And, when shown, it would have appeared to have been a notice, not addressed to the defendant, or to any one else, by name. The notice is required to be either written or printed. Rev. Stat., chap. 78, \u00a7 2. And we think the notice must be addressed to the person by name, who is to be notified. The delivery of the notice to the party will not be regarded as sufficient, unless it is thus addressed to him. He is not to be left to infer from the fact that the notice is delivered to him, that he is a person duly enrolled and intended to be notified to perform military duty. By what name is he to understand that he is enrolled ? And if he be not in fact enrolled by his proper name or designation, can he be considered as enrolled at all ? A notice that is sufficient when delivered to a party, is equally sufficient if it were left at his usual place of abode. But how could a notice, left at one\u2019s usual place of abode, containing the address of no one, be considered a proper and legal notice, such as the statute contemplates ? We have no hesitation in holding that the notice in this case was not such an one as the party was entitled to.</p>\n<p id=\"b113-5\">The evidence offered by the defendant at the trial, and rejected by the court, we think should have been admitted.</p>\n<p id=\"b113-6\">The limits of military companies, intended by chap. 77, \u00a7 1, and chap. 84, \u00a7 1, Rev. Stat., are territorial. <em>Jones </em>v. <em>French, </em>2 Foster\u2019s Rep. 64; <em>Perry </em>v. <em>Dover, </em>12 Pick. 206. The recorded limits, shown by this case, are of that character. All the hundred acre lots in Barnstead, except one range on the northeasterly end of said lots, are made to constitute the territory within which the persons shall reside who shall be enrolled in the second company of infantry, and the remaining part of said town was made to constitute the sixth company of infantry. By \u201c the remaining part of said town,\u201d was clearly meant the remaining territory of the town, excepting that part which was included within the limits of the second company. Upon the face of the record, the whole town appears to be divided into two companies, having for their limits well defined geographical boundaries. That is sufficient. Whether the copy of the record given in evidence was competent proof of the facts contained in it, and of due <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"114\">*114</page-number>authority to establish the limits of the companies, we need not now inquire. Nor is it necessary to inquire into or decide the other questions in this case not already considered.</p>\n<p id=\"b114-5\">The verdict must be set aside, on account of the rejection of the evidence offered on the part of the defendant.</p>\n<p id=\"b114-6\">\n<em>Verdict set aside.</em>\n</p>\n</opinion>\n</casebody>\n",
