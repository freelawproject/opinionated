The first one argued is that the officer\u2019s return does not show a valid notice in writing of the time and place of the sale to the demand-ant, the debtor, as required by Pub. Sts. c. 172, \u00a7 29, if the debtor is found within his precinct. The return reads, \u201c I gave notice in writing to the within named judgment debtor of the time and place of sale by leaving the same at her last and usual place of abode, and by mailing a like notice to her address, as described in said execution, in a securely sealed envelope, fully prepaid.\u201d The objection that the return does not state expressly that the debtor was not found within the officer\u2019s precinct, based on the decisions under the corresponding section of the Gen. Sts. c. 103, \u00a7 41, <em>(Owen </em>v. Neveau, 128 Mass. 427, <em>Parker </em>v. Abbott, 130 Mass. 25, <em>Bayley, petitioner, </em>132 Mass. 457, <em>Sawyer </em>v. <em>Harmon, </em>136 Mass. 414, 415,) is met by Pub. Sts. c. 172, \u00a7 46, (St. 1881, c. 207,) passed soon after the decision in <em>Parker </em>v. <em>Abbott. </em>This provides that any notice required to be given to the debtor under that chapter \u201c may either be served upon him personally, or left at his last and usual place of abode.\u201d The alternative of service by leaving the notice at the last and usual place of abode, which formerly was allowed by St. 1798, c. 77, \u00a7 4, is restored by this section. <em>Croacher v. Oesting, </em>143 Mass. 195, 196. See <em>Parker </em>v. <em>Abbott, </em>130 Mass. 25, 26, 27. The return <em>prima facie </em>means that the place whete the service was made was within the officer\u2019s precinct, that is, it is to be presumed in the absence of evidence to the contrary that the service was made where the officer had authority to make it. <em>Richardson </em>v. <em>Smith, </em>1 Allen, 541, 543. The return also sufficiently establishes that the place of service was the last and usual place of abode. There is no evidence which even attempts to contradict it. <em>Stewart </em>v. <em>Griswold, </em>134 Mass. 391, 393. <em>Wolcott </em>v. <em>Ely, </em>2 Allen, 338, 340. <em>Bott </em>v. <em>Burnell, </em>11 Mass. 163, 165.

(2d ed.) \u00a7\u00a7 387, 365.</p>\n<p id=\"b170-5\">It is objected that the officer was required by the same \u00a7 29 to cause two or more notifications to be posted up in Brookline, where the land lies. The language of the section is, \u201cshall also cause notifications thereof to be posted up in some public place in the city or town where the land lies, and also in two adjoining <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"149\">*149</page-number>cities or towns if there are so many in the county.\u201d Apart from history, no one would doubt, we think, that the plural \u201c notifications \u201d was used with reference to the several cities or towns in which notifications are required, notwithstanding the words \u201c and also.\u201d In fact, however, the plural is a survival from St. 1798, c. 77, \u00a7 4, which required the posting up of notifications in two or more public places in the town where the land lies. The Rev. Sts. c. 73, \u00a7 39, substituted \u201c some public place \u201d for \u201c two or more public places,\u201d and thereby made one notification sufficient.</p>\n<p id=\"b171-5\">The next objection urged is that the officer returns that he took \u201c all the right in equity \u201d which the debtor then had \u201c to redeem the following described mortgaged real estate,\u201d whereas at the time there had been no breach of condition, so that the debtor\u2019s right was a right at law alone. The expression used is inaccurate, no doubt, but illustrations are not necessary to show that the term \u201c equity of redemption \u201d is used in common speech to describe the title of a mortgagor without regard to whether the condition has been broken. A striking one will be found in the definition given by the Century Dictionary under the word \u201c equity.\u201d The words of the return, although a little more formal than \u201c equity of redemption,\u201d and throwing a little more emphasis on the possible antithesis between equity and law, in our opinion are to be taken in the popular sense, and do not invalidate the sale.</p>\n<p id=\"b171-6\">The execution was in the usual form, directing the officer to cause the debt to be satisfied \u201c of the goods, chattels, or lands of the said judgment debtor.\u201d The word \u201c lands \u201d in this connection embraces any interest authorized by law to be taken. See Pub. Sts. c. 172, \u00a7\u00a7 1, 27; c. 171, \u00a7 20; c. 3, \u00a7 3, cl. 12. The recital in the return that the officer had deposited a copy of the execution in the clerk\u2019s office and also in the registry of deeds, with a memorandum upon it stating that it had been placed in his hands \u201c for the purpose of taking the lands \u201d of the debtor, merely follows the execution, and does not affect the question before us.</p>\n<p id=\"b171-7\">The only other objection argued is that the execution is not supported by the judgment because the judgment was recovered by the plaintiffs in an action of contract wherein in the writ <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"150\">*150</page-number>they were described as executors of the will of Oliver Ames, whereas the execution recites a recovery by them personally. It appears from the record that the defect is merely a clerical error. An amendment would be allowed as of course from the record, without other evidence. Under such circumstances the writ may be treated as amended in this proceeding. <em>Dewey </em>v. Peeler, 161 Mass. 135, 136, and cases cited. Freem. Ex.
