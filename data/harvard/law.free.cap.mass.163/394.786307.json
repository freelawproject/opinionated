that he never in any way represented the plaintiff; that he had authority to sell the houses for $11,000, and that when $10,500 was offered he was not authorized to bind the trustee, but, believing it for the interest of the trust under the then existing circumstances to sell at $10,500, he agreed to recommend the sale; that between February 28 and March 3, 1893, he got authority from Walter Ela, trustee, to sell at $10,500, and on said March 3 of the opinion of the judge of probate that the trustee could legally sell at $10,500, and that on said March 3 he saw Goodnough; that Goodnough was the plaintiff\u2019s agent; 'that he told him that Walter Ela, trustee, accepted the offer of $10,500; and that on said March 3 the defendant left with Goodnough a copy of the will under which Walter Ela was appointed trustee, and the old deed for purposes of examination of title.</summary>\n<summary data-order=\"12\" data-type=\"summary\" id=\"b417-7\">The defendant offered to prove the transactions at the time of his signing the agreement of February 28,1893, as tending not to vary, but to explain, what the parties meant by the words that were used;

but that the defendant said that he had paid the money over to Walter Ela, trustee, and declined to pay any commission, as it had been understood throughout that Goodnough was the broker for Sirk, and not for the seller.</summary>\n<summary data-order=\"14\" data-type=\"summary\" id=\"b418-5\">The defendant offered to prove that from May 13,1892, Goodnough and Sirk both knew that the defendant was not the principal, but was agent for Walter Ela, trustee; that on -March 30, 1893, before the suit was brought, Goodnough and the plaintiff both knew that the defendant had paid the money over to his principal; that the fact that the sale was not carried out was the fault of the plaintiff solely; that the defendant and his principal did all acts that either of them could be required to do for the completion of the sale, and that, according to the intent of the parties, the $500 was given to the defendant for no other purpose than as a forfeit, or as an earnest, or as binding the bargain in case the trustee should ratify the proposed sale at $10,500; and that the trustee did so ratify the sale.</summary>\n<summary data-order=\"15\" data-type=\"summary\" id=\"b418-6\">The defendant was allowed to amend his answer, to the effect that the agreement of February 28, 1893, \u201c does not show the true intent, meaning, and understanding of the parties thereto, and that under St. 1883, c. 223, \u00a7 14, the defendant will prove the true meaning and intent thereof ; and that the true meaning of said paper was that the $500 should be retained by the defendant as a forfeit \u201d ; but the judge ruled that the amendment did not sufficiently set forth facts which would entitle the defendant to set up a defence under St. 1883, c. 223, \u00a7 14, ruled that the evidence offered of transactions subsequent to the execution and delivery of the agreement of February 28, 1893, was not sufficient to show a modification or alteration of the agreement therein contained; that the evidence offered was inadmissible under the answer and the amendment thereto, and directed the jury to return a verdict for the plaintiff, the defendant not desiring to go to the jury under these rulings. The defendant alleged exceptions.</summary>\n<attorneys data-order=\"16\" data-type=\"attorneys\" id=\"b419-4\"><page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"397\">*397</page-number><em>A.

There is nothing in it binding the plaintiff to take a conveyance of the property, nor anything which shows that, if he refused to take a conveyance, he was to forfeit the $500. The agreement expressly provides that, if the sale was not completed within one-month, the defendant was to return the money. In the absence of any qualifying words, we must construe that as meaning not completed for any cause by either party. The defendant ex- \u2022 pressly stipulates that he does not bind himself, nor \u201c attempt to bind any parties to the completion of said transaction.\u201d The tender of the deed did not complete the sale. Nothing short of an actual conveyance of the title to the plaintiff would have done that. No doubt, if the plaintiff had bound himself to purchase, a tender of a sufficient deed would have entitled the defendant to specific performance. But in the absence of any valid agreement to that effect on the part of the plaintiff, or of any provision that he should forfeit the $500 if he did not complete the sale within a month, we do not see how his refusal to accept the deed entitled the defendant to keep the $500 which according to the terms of the agreement, the defendant personally bound himself to pay if the sale was not completed within one month.</p>\n<p id=\"b419-7\">The evidence offered by the defendant to show what took place prior to, and at the time of, and subsequent to the making of the agreement was rightly rejected as it tended to vary and affect the written contract. If the amended answer could be regarded as sufficient under St. 1883, c. 223, \u00a7 14, the facts offered in evidence would not in view of the construction which we give to the agreement, have entitled the defendant \u201c in equity to be absolutely and unconditionally relieved against the plaintiff\u2019s claim or cause of action.\u201d <em>Roberts </em>v.
