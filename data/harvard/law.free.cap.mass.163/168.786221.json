It did not appear from the bill of exceptions that this was all the evidence in the case. <em>Held, </em>that it could not be said that the evidence was inadmissible; it might have been made competent by other evidence; although the court did not mean to intimate that, if it stood alone, it would be incompetent.</headnotes>\n<summary data-order=\"7\" data-type=\"summary\" id=\"b190-9\">Complaint, for keeping a liquor nuisance in a dwelling-house at Canton, between August 1, 1893, and January 1, 1894. At the trial in the Superior Court before Sherman, J., one Plunkett, the complainant, a police officer, testified that on September 10 four men drove up to the defendant\u2019s house; that one entered and then returned with a bottle in his hand; that they had a drink and emptied the bottle; and that then one of them went back into the house and came out with the bottle filled again, the defendant accompanying him as far as the piazza, and standing there as they drove away.</summary>\n<summary data-order=\"8\" data-type=\"summary\" id=\"b190-10\">The defendant objected to the admission of this testimony.

That being so, it is manifest that we cannot say that it was inadmissible. It may have been made competent by other evidence. We do not mean to intimate that if it stood alone, it would have no tendency to show that the defendant kept a liquor nuisance in his house. <em>Exceptions overruled.</em></p>\n</opinion>\n</casebody>\n",
