Sts. c. 126, \u00a7 4, do not apply.</headnotes>\n<summary data-order=\"7\" data-type=\"summary\" id=\"b91-11\">Contbact, to recover money paid by the plaintiff to the defendant under an agreement for the purchase and sale of real estate, on the ground that the title thereto was defective.</summary>\n<summary data-order=\"8\" data-type=\"summary\" id=\"b91-12\">The case was submitted to the Superior Court, and, after judgment for the defendant, to this court on appeal, upon agreed facts, which so far as material appear in the opinion.</summary>\n<attorneys data-order=\"9\" data-type=\"attorneys\" id=\"b91-13\"><em>J.

That statute has no application when the language of a devise shows that the intention of the testator was to give a fee. <em>Weld </em>v. <em>Williams, </em>13 Met. 486, 496. <em>Barton </em>v. <em>Bigelow, </em>4 Gray, 353, 357. <em>Hayward </em>v. <em>Howe, </em>12 Gray, 49. <em>Trumbull </em>v. <em>Trumbull, </em>149 Mass. 200. For the statute to operate there must be a creation of an estate for life, and then a devise or a grant in remainder to the heirs of the life tenant. As we construe the devise under which the defendant holds, it gives her the fee, and does not create a life estate in her, nor a remainder in her heirs.</p>\n<p id=\"b91-16\">The testator gives and devises to his wife by name all his real property, \u201c for her sole use and comfort during her natural life, and to her heirs and assigns forever.\u201d The words \u201c heirs and assigns \u201d are the usual technical words in a deed to signify a fee, and, although unnecessary for that purpose in a will, are commonly used in wills with the same meaning. The use of the word \u201c assigns \u201d implies that she has the power of disposal. <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"70\">*70</page-number>The absence before the words <em>\u201cto </em>her heirs and assigns forever \u201d of technical phrases, such as \u201c after her death,\u201d or \u201c in remainder,\u201d commonly employed to denote a devise or gift in remainder, and also the fact that the whole limitation is in an unbroken sentence, lead to the same result. We think the words <em>\u201c </em>for her sole use and comfort during her natural life,\u201d as used by the testator, were not meant by him to cut down his devise, or to make an estate for life, but to emphasize his intention that she should have the sole and full benefit of the property given, which included personalty as well as realty. So far as circumstances stated in the agreed facts are competent for our consideration, they do not militate against the construction which we put upon the language of the testator\u2019s devise. The result is, that the deed tendered would, if accepted, have conveyed a fee to the plaintiff, and he has no right to recover the purchase money. <em>Judgment for the defendant affirmed.</em></p>\n</opinion>\n</casebody>\n",
