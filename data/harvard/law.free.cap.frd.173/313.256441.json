The United States has filed a memorandum in opposition to Plaintiffs\u2019 motion (doc. 315). For the reasons stated below, Plaintiffs\u2019 motion is GRANTED IN PART and DENIED IN PART.</p>\n<p id=\"b379-24\">I. Background</p>\n<p id=\"b379-25\">Plaintiffs are the prevailing parties in this equal protection challenge to Florida\u2019s Third Congressional District under the authority of <em>Shaw v. Reno, </em>509 U.S. 630, 113 S.Ct. 2816, 125 L.Ed.2d 511 (1993).<footnotemark>1</footnotemark> On May 1, 1996, Plaintiffs filed a bill of costs with the clerk of the court pursuant to Federal Rule of Civil Procedure 54(d)(1). Plaintiffs sought a total of $10,001.53 in taxable costs. <em>See </em>Doc. 202. On October 29, 1996, the court held that costs would be taxed solely against the United States, a defendant-intervenor in the underlying action. <em>Johnson v. Mortham, </em>950 <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"316\">*316</page-number>F.Supp. 1117, 1128 (N.D.Fla.1996) (three-judge panel).</p>\n<p id=\"b380-4\">On March 19, 1997, the clerk taxed costs in the amount of $120.00 against defendants and defendant-intervenors Corrine Brown, Bolley L. Johnson, Pat Thomas, Frank Cummings, Samuel L. Green, Sr., Leonard O\u2019Neal, Gly-nell Presley, Sandra Mortham, and Mary Lawson Brown. The clerk explained the reason for the reduced award as follows:</p>\n<blockquote id=\"A25g\">The bulk of the requested costs were unsubstantiated. Deputy Clerk, Ms. Debi Boone, on two occasions, contacted [Plaintiffs\u2019] attorney G.J. Rod Sullivan, Jr. requesting documentation needed to substantiate each cost. To this date no documentation has been filed with the Clerk [sic] Office.</blockquote>\n<p id=\"b380-5\">Doc. 311. Apparently, the $120.00 awarded to Plaintiffs was the amount of the court filing fee for which the clerk had a record of payment. On April 2, 1997, Plaintiffs moved the court for reconsideration of the clerk\u2019s award of taxation of costs (doe. 312).</p>\n<p id=\"b380-6\">II. Analysis</p>\n<p id=\"b380-7\">A. <em>Inadvertent failure to tax costs against the United States:</em></p>\n<p id=\"b380-8\">The Plaintiffs now seek reconsideration of the clerk\u2019s award of taxable costs. Plaintiffs first represent that the clerk inadvertently taxed costs against the defendants and defendant-intervenors named above, instead of against the United States as provided in the October 29, 1996 order. <em>See </em>Doc. 312 at 1. The United States agrees with Plaintiffs. Doc. 315 at 1-3 &amp; n. 2. The court also concurs. <em>See Johnson v. Mortham, </em>950 F.Supp. at 1128. Therefore, Plaintiffs\u2019 motion for reconsideration of the parties against whom costs shall be awarded is GRANTED. The clerk\u2019s award of taxable costs (doc. 311) shall be modified accordingly.</p>\n<p id=\"b380-9\">B. <em>Amount of taxable costs:</em></p>\n<p id=\"b380-10\">Plaintiffs next move for reconsideration of the amount of costs taxed by the clerk. In support of their motion, Plaintiffs make the following statements:</p>\n<blockquote id=\"b380-11\">.... The Plaintiffs moved for taxation of costs and the Clerk requested additional documentation. The additional documentation requested is attached hereto.</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b380-13\">******</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b380-14\">[T]he clerk has taxed costs in the amount of $120.00, asserting that the bulk of the requested costs were unsubstantiated. Attached hereto is substantiation for all of the costs contained under the Plaintiffs [sic] bill of cost [sic] filed on April 26,1996.</blockquote>\n<p id=\"b380-15\">Doc. 312 at 1. Plaintiffs do not attempt to explain why the supporting documentation was not included with their original bill of costs.</p>\n<p id=\"b380-16\">The United States opposes Plaintiffs\u2019 request for reconsideration of the amount of costs to be taxed. According to the United States, Plaintiffs\u2019 motion is untimely under Rule 54(d)(1), Fed.R.Civ.P. because it was filed more than five days after the clerk taxed costs. Federal Rule of Civil Procedure 54(d)(1), providing for \u201ccosts other than attorneys\u2019 fees,\u201d states that \u201c[o]n motion served within 5 days [after the clerk has taxed costs], the action of the clerk may be reviewed by the court.\u201d The clerk awarded taxable costs on March 19, 1997. <em>See </em>Doc. 311. Therefore, the United States concludes that Plaintiffs had until March 26, 1997 [excluding the intermediate Saturday and Sunday pursuant to Fed.R.Civ.P. 6(a) ] to serve a motion seeking review of the clerk\u2019s order.</p>\n<p id=\"b380-17\">The court agrees with the United States that Plaintiffs\u2019 objections to the clerk\u2019s award of taxable costs had to be served on the clerk by March 26, 1997. Plaintiffs\u2019 motion for reconsideration is untimely because it was not filed until April 2, 1997. As a general rule, if a \u201cparty fails to file a timely objection to the clerk\u2019s taxation of costs, any objection is waived, and the district court is not obliged to review the taxation of costs.\u201d 10 James Wm. Moore Et Al., Moore\u2019s Federal Practice \u00b6 54.100[3], at 54-144 (3d Ed.1997). Nevertheless, the five-day time limit is not jurisdictional, so the court has discretion to consider Plaintiffs\u2019 untimely objections. <em>See, e.g., Lorenz v. Valley Forge Ins. Co., </em>23 F.3d 1259, 1260 (7th Cir.1994); <em>Baum v. United States, </em>432 F.2d 85, 86 (5th <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"317\">*317</page-number>Cir.1970)<footnotemark>2</footnotemark>; <em>American Key Corp. v. Cumberland Assoc., </em>102 F.R.D. 496, 497 (N.D.Ga.1984). <em>But see Person v. Omni Int\u2019l Hotel-Norfolk, </em>106 F.R.D. 7, 9 (E.D.Va.1984) (denying motion for review of clerk\u2019s taxation of costs where it was filed 45 days after clerk taxed costs and movant failed to seek an enlargement of time within which to file the motion); <em>Raio v. American Airlines, Inc., </em>102 F.R.D. 608, 610 (E.D.Pa.1984) (denying motion where it was filed six days late). On the other hand, the court is cognizant that it \u201cought not arbitrarily or without reason extend the time for [Plaintiffs\u2019] objection to the taxation of costs.\u201d <em>Person, </em>106 F.R.D. at 8.</p>\n<p id=\"b381-5\">There is no good cause present in the case at bar to extend the time period specified in Rule 54(d)(1), Fed.R.Civ.P. Plaintiffs\u2019 motion for reconsideration does not even attempt to explain why the motion was untimely filed. Moreover, at no time did Plaintiffs seek an extension of time within which to file their motion. Plaintiffs clearly cannot be permitted to unilaterally extend filing periods set forth in the Federal Rules of Civil Procedure. <em>See generally </em>Fed.R.Civ.P. 6(b) <em>(idistrict court </em>may order enlargement of time for good cause shown) (emphasis added); 1 Moore\u2019s Federal Practice \u00b6 6.06[1][b], at 6-39 (\u201cBecause the court bears the ultimate responsibility for handling its docket, <em>the court </em>must exercise full control over extensions of time periods.\u201d) (emphasis added) (citation omitted); <em>cf. Northwest Airlines, Inc. v. American Airlines, Inc., </em>870 F.Supp. 1504, 1507 n. 4 (D.Minn.1994) (a party \u201ccannot unilaterally extend a court-set deadline\u201d). As a result, the court is well within its discretion to deny Plaintiffs\u2019 motion as untimely under Rule 54(d)(1), Fed.R.Civ.P. <em>See generally Manor Healthcare Corp. v. Lomelo, </em>929 F.2d 633, 639 (11th Cir.1991) (district court\u2019s decision on taxation of costs will not be overturned absent a \u201cclear abuse of discretion\u201d), <em>reh\u2019g denied, </em>942 F.2d 798; <em>Trammell Real Estate Corp. v. Trammell, </em>748 F.2d 1516, 1517 (11th Cir.1984) (per curiam) (\u201cWhether to tax costs is a matter left to the district court\u2019s discretion.\u201d).<footnotemark>3</footnotemark></p>\n<p id=\"b381-10\">Nevertheless, the court instead opts to deny Plaintiffs\u2019 motion on its merits. As an initial matter, the court declines to consider any of the documentation untimely submitted with Plaintiffs\u2019 motion for reconsideration. In fact, Plaintiffs\u2019 \u201cmotion for reconsideration\u201d is really nothing more than a veiled attempt to supply documentation Plaintiffs were required by local rule to submit with their bill of costs within thirty days after entry of judgment. <em>See </em>N.D. Fla. Loc. R. 54.2. The bill of costs form itself makes the documentation requirement clear, stating \u201cSPECIAL NOTE: Attach to your bill an itemization <em>and documentation </em>for requested costs in all categories.\u201d Doc. 202 (capitals in original, emphasis added). Furthermore, on at least two occasions the clerk\u2019s office contacted Plaintiffs\u2019 counsel about filing the necessary documentation, to no avail. <em>See </em>Doc. 311. Plaintiffs cannot now be permitted to evade the thirty day rule for filing a bill of costs in proper form by supplying some of the requisite documentation<footnotemark>4</footnotemark>.nearly a year after judgment has been entered. Such action is tantamount to filing either an untimely second bill of costs or a motion for retaxation of costs, which case law shows do not have to be considered by the court. <em>See, e.g., Quarles v. Oxford Mun. Separate Sch., </em>868 F.2d 750, 758 (5th Cir.1989); <em>Fargo Biltmore Motor Hotel Corp. v. Best Western Int\u2019l, </em>742 F.2d 459, 464-65 (8th Cir.1984); <em>Dataq, Inc. v. Tokheim Corp., </em>736 F.2d 601, <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"318\">*318</page-number>605 (10th Cir.1984). Consequently, the supporting documentation attached to Plaintiffs\u2019 motion for reconsideration of clerk\u2019s award of taxation of costs (doc. 312) shall be STRICKEN as untimely submitted pursuant to Federal Rule of Civil Procedure 54(d)(1) and Northern District of Florida Local Rule 54.2.</p>\n<p id=\"b382-4\">In the absence of any supporting documentation, Plaintiffs are left with their counsel\u2019s verified statement of costs incurred in the conduct of this litigation.<footnotemark>5</footnotemark> Counsel\u2019s statement includes broad categories of expenses and a generalized itemization under each category.<footnotemark>6</footnotemark> The court will briefly examine these categories in turn.</p>\n<p id=\"b382-5\">The first category of expenses is for $180.50 paid as fees of the clerk. Although such fees may be taxed pursuant to 28 U.S.C.\u2019 \u00a7 1920(1), Plaintiffs do not specify why these fees were paid. The clerk was only able to confirm that Plaintiffs had paid a $120.00 filing fee at the time this action was commenced.<footnotemark>7</footnotemark> Therefore, the remaining $60.50 requested by Plaintiffs is DENIED. Plaintiffs are only entitled to reimbursement for the $120.00 filing fee. <em>Cf. Dickinson Supply, Inc., </em>423 F.2d at 110 (clerk properly awarded $15 in clerk\u2019s costs to prevailing party, where prevailing party failed to timely file bill of costs in compliance with local rule).</p>\n<p id=\"b382-6\">The next category is for $160.00 incurred for service of summons and subpoenas. Plaintiffs itemize three payments made to B.J. Quinn, Dick Fischer Investigations, and Professional Investigations, presumably all private process servers. There is a split of authority as to whether fees of a private process server may be taxed under 28 U.S.C. \u00a7 1920. <em>Cf. Alflex v. Underwriters Lab., Inc., </em>914 F.2d 175, 178 (9th Cir.1990) (taxing costs of private process server), <em>cert. denied, </em>502 U.S. 812, 112 S.Ct. 61, 116 L.Ed.2d 36 (1991); <em>Roberts v. Homelite Div. of Textron, Inc., </em>117 F.R.D. 637, 641 (N.D.Ind.1987) (same) <em>with Crues v. K.F.C. Corp., </em>768 F.2d 230, 234 (8th Cir.1985) (such fees are not taxable); <em>Zdunek v. Washington Metro. Transit Auth., </em>100 F.R.D. 689, 692 (D.D.C.1983) (same). However, the court need not resolve this question because there is no documentation to support Plaintiffs\u2019 claimed costs. Accordingly, all of these costs are DENIED.</p>\n<p id=\"b382-12\">Plaintiffs\u2019 next category of claimed costs is for $1,364.50 for court reporter fees and transcripts \u201cnecessarily obtained for use in the case.\u201d Such costs can be recovered under 28 U.S.C. \u00a7 1920(2) if they are properly documented. Plaintiffs merely recite the names of court reporters and court reporting services and the amounts paid to each. No where do Plaintiffs identify whose depositions were included in the request for costs. Additionally, Plaintiffs have failed to produce any documentation supporting their requested costs. Under these circumstances, the court cannot determine whether these depositions were necessarily obtained for use in the case or whether the amount of renumeration requested by Plaintiffs is reasonable. Hence, all of these costs must be DENIED. <em>See Lock v. Jenkins, </em>634 F.Supp. 615, 619 (N.D.Ind.1986); <em>Lyons v. Cunningham, </em>583 F.Supp. 1147, 1156 (S.D.N.Y.1983).</p>\n<p id=\"b383-4\"><page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"319\">*319</page-number>Plaintiffs claim three categories of expenses which presumably fall under 28 U.S.C. \u00a7\u00a7 1920(3)-(4), providing for the taxation of \u201c[flees and disbursements for printing and witnesses\u201d and \u201c[flees for exemplification and copies of papers necessarily obtained for use in the case,\u201d respectively. Regarding the sum of $972.27 claimed for fees and disbursements for printing, Plaintiffs have not described these expenses with any particularity whatsoever [i.e., what the expenses were for, such as \u201ca color map of the Third Congressional District, submitted at trial as Plaintiffs\u2019 Exhibit 1\u201d]; rather, Plaintiffs merely include general statements of the party to whom they made the payments, including: \u201cNationsbank Visa,\u201d \u201cSupervisor of Elections,\u201d \u201cReddi Arts,\u201d and \u201cG.J. Rod Sullivan, Jr. \u2014 Reimbursement.\u201d The expenses of $3,607.82 claimed for copies obtained for use in the ease are in an even more precarious position: $3,434.75 of these claimed expenses are for \u201cG.J. Rod Sullivan, Jr. 13,739 [copies] x .25\u201d. There is absolutely no breakdown of the nature of the copies or their use or intended use at trial which would allow the court to determine whether the copies in question were \u201creasonably necessary\u201d for trial. \u201cSimply making unsubstantiated claims that [documents or copies] were necessary is insufficient to permit recovery.\u201d <em>Corsair Asset Management, Inc. v. Moskovitz, </em>142 F.R.D. 347, 352 (N.D.Ga.1992). <em>Accord Berryman v. Hofbauer, </em>161 F.R.D. 341, 344 (E.D.Mich.1995); <em>Voight v. Subaru-Isuzu Automotive, Inc., </em>141 F.R.D. 99, 102-03 (N.D.Ind.1992); <em>Fulton Fed. Sav. &amp; Loan Ass\u2019n of Atlanta v. American Ins. Co., </em>143 F.R.D. 292, 299-300 (N.D.Ga.1991); <em>American Key Corp. v. Cumberland Assoc., </em>102 F.R.D. 496, 499 (N.D.Ga.1984). In addition, Plaintiffs have provided no proof of payment or documentation for the $135.00 claimed as \u201cfees for witnesses\u201d [or for the amounts claimed under the other two categories, for that matter]. Thus, all of these costs are DENIED.</p>\n<p id=\"b383-8\">Plaintiffs also seek taxation of costs for $1,325.31 in travel expenses. There is no explanation about who incurred these costs or for what purpose they were incurred. The itemization merely includes entries for \u201cNationsbank Visa,\u201d \u201cG.J. Rod Sullivan, Jr.,\u201d and \u201cCarol Walters.\u201d It is unclear whether these are costs incurred for witnesses or for the travel expenses of Plaintiffs\u2019 counsel. To the extent the claimed costs are for the former, Plaintiffs\u2019 failure to submit supporting documentation precludes recovery. <em>See </em>28 U.S.C. \u00a7 1821(c)(1) (in seeking recovery for witness travel costs, \u201c[a] receipt of other evidence of actual cost <em>shall he furnished </em>\u201d) (emphasis added) To the extent the claimed costs are for the latter, although an \u00e1ttorney\u2019s out-of-pocket travel expenses may be recoverable as taxable costs<footnotemark>8</footnotemark>, the lack of supporting documentation is likewise fatal.<footnotemark>9</footnotemark> Consequently, all of these costs are DENIED.</p>\n<p id=\"b383-9\">Plaintiffs further seek reimbursement for $431.80 for \u201covernight letters.\u201d Plaintiffs itemize these expenses as paid to either \u201cFederal Express\u201d or \u201cUnishippers,\u201d with no supporting documentation or other descriptions of the precise nature of the charges in question. These claimed costs are DENIED. Express delivery costs are not taxable under 28 U.S.C. \u00a7 1920. <em>See Hollenbeck v. Falstaff Brewing Corp., </em>605 F.Supp. 421, 439 (D.Mo.1984) (Federal Express and <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"320\">*320</page-number>local delivery service charges are not taxable costs under \u00a7 1920), <em>aff'd, </em>780 F.2d 20 (8th Cir.1985); <em>see also </em>citations in the next paragraph, infra (postage costs not taxable under \u00a7 1920). Even if express delivery charges were taxable, Plaintiffs\u2019 failure to include supporting documentation would likewise prevent recovery. <em>Cf. Frederick v. City of Portland, </em>162 F.R.D. 139 (D.Or.1995) (court declined to tax costs of hand delivery charges where there was no supporting documentation).</p>\n<p id=\"b384-4\">As to the last two categories, \u201clong distance telephone and telefaxes\u201d and \u201cpostage,\u201d the court finds that these costs are not taxable under 28 U.S.C. \u00a7 1920. <em>See Wahl v. Carrier Mfg. Co. Inc., </em>511 F.2d 209, 216-17 (7th Cir.1975); <em>Ortega v. City of Kansas City, </em>659 F.Supp. 1201, 1219 (D.Kan.1987), <em>rev\u2019d on other grounds, </em>875 F.2d 1497 (10th Cir.), <em>cert. denied, </em>493 U.S. 934, 110 S.Ct. 325, 107 L.Ed.2d 315 (1989); <em>Hollenbeck, </em>605 F.Supp. at 439; <em>Wolfe v. Wolfe, </em>570 F.Supp. 826, 828 (D.S.C.1983); <em>see also Wolf v. Planned Property Management, </em>735 F.Supp. 882, 883-84 (N.D.Ill.1990) (long-distance charges not taxable where \u00a7 1920 did not list such charges as taxable costs); <em>but see Arthur S. Langenderfer, Inc. v. S.E. Johnson Co., </em>684 F.Supp. 953, 960 (N.D.Ohio 1988) (telephone charges may be taxed, and implying that postage could be taxed if properly documented). Once again, even if these costs were taxable, the absence of documentation would preclude Plaintiffs from recovering them. Accordingly, Plaintiffs\u2019 claims for telephone and postage expenses are DENIED.</p>\n<p id=\"b384-5\">C. <em>Conclusion:</em></p>\n<p id=\"b384-6\">Attorneys litigating matters of great public importance, such as the case at bar, perform a vital service to the community at large. Nevertheless, performing this service does not free attorneys for prevailing parties from strict compliance with the rules governing taxation of costs. <em>See generally Central Delaware Branch of NAACP v. City of Dover, </em>123 F.R.D. 85, 92-93 (D.Del.1988) (denying taxable costs to prevailing party in voting rights act case to the extent the claimed- expenses were inadequately documented or duplicitous). To hold otherwise would be in direct contravention to the function of Rule-54: to provide a summary of requested taxable costs shortly after judgment is entered for \u201cthe purpose of permitting a losing party to know the extent of his obligations and decide whether or not to appeal, either to secure reversal or a settlement.\u201d <em>Doran v. United States, </em>475 F.2d 742, 743-44 (1st Cir.1973). Consequently, failure to timely submit an affidavit or other documentation setting forth litigation expenditures with adequate particularity is grounds for denying taxation of costs, <em>see, e.g., Davis v. Commercial Union Ins. Co., </em>892 F.2d 378, 385 (5th Cir.1990), or reducing the amount of costs awarded, <em>see generally Hensley v. Eckerhart, </em>461 U.S. 424, 433, 103 S.Ct. 1933, 1939, 76 L.Ed.2d 40 (1983) (\u201cWhere documentation ... is inadequate, the district court may reduce the award accordingly.\u201d).</p>\n<p id=\"b384-9\">In seeking to tax costs against the United States, Plaintiffs\u2019 counsel has been less than diligent in complying with governing statutes [such as 28 U.S.C. \u00a7\u00a7 1821 and 1920], the Federal Rules of Civil Procedure, and the rules of this court. Counsel has provided no reason for his failure to file supporting documentation to his bill of costs in a timely manner. In any event, \u201cthe failure to act [by Mr. Sullivan] was the result either of a failure to understand the law, or one of those careless omissions to which everyone is subject, but which do not excuse inaction.\u201d<footnotemark>10</footnotemark> <em>Nichols-Morris Corp. v. Morris, </em>279 F.2d 81, 83 (2d Cir.1960) (L.Hand, J.). The absence of excusable neglect is particularly true where, as is the case here, counsel has previously been sanctioned for his lack of diligence in complying with other rules and court orders. <em>See Johnson v. Mortham, </em>950 F.Supp. <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"321\">*321</page-number>at 1124-26 (reducing the amount of attorneys\u2019 fees awarded to Plaintiffs by 25% because of Plaintiffs\u2019 counsel\u2019s failure to comply with the local rule governing the filing of attorney time records); Doc. 161 at 3 (Plaintiffs\u2019 counsel\u2019s failure to comply with the terms of the court\u2019s scheduling order was sanctionable misconduct). For all of these reasons, the court reaffirms the clerk\u2019s decision to limit Plaintiffs\u2019 taxable costs to $120.00, the amount of the court\u2019s filing fee.</p>\n<p id=\"b385-5\">In sum, the message conveyed by today\u2019s decision is quite simple: while \u201ccosts other than attorneys\u2019 fees shall be allowed as of course to the prevailing party,\u201d Fed.R.Civ.P. 54(d)(1), all attorneys practicing before this or any other federal court must still be aware of the rules and procedures controlling the taxation of costs. Failure to strictly comply with the time and filing requirements by parties seeking taxable costs may result in disallowance of some or all of those costs.</p>\n<p id=\"b385-6\">Accordingly, it is hereby</p>\n<p id=\"b385-7\">ORDERED AND ADJUDGED:</p>\n<p id=\"b385-8\">(1) The supporting documentation attached to Plaintiffs\u2019 motion for reconsideration of clerk\u2019s award of taxation of costs (doc. 312) is STRICKEN as untimely submitted pursuant to Federal Rule of Civil Procedure 54(d)(1) and Northern District of Florida Local Rule 54.2.</p>\n<p id=\"b385-9\">(2) Plaintiffs\u2019 motion for reconsideration of clerk\u2019s award of taxation of costs (doc. 312) is GRANTED IN PART and DENIED IN PART. Plaintiffs\u2019 motion is GRANTED only to the extent that Plaintiffs seek taxation of costs against the United States in the amount of $120.00. Plaintiffs\u2019 motion is DENIED in all other respects.</p>\n<p id=\"b385-10\">(3) Pursuant to the court\u2019s October 29, 1996 order (doc. 300), the clerk is directed to amend the award of taxable costs to Plaintiffs (doc. 311) by deleting the language \u201cagainst Defendants Corrine Brown ... Samuel L. Green, Sr.\u201d and inserting in its place the language \u201cagainst defendant \u2014 in-tervenor United States.\u201d</p>\n<p id=\"b385-11\">[[Image here]]</p>\n<p id=\"b386-3\"><page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"322\">*322</page-number>[[Image here]]</p>\n<p id=\"b387-3\"><page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"323\">*323</page-number>[[Image here]]</p>\n<footnote label=\"1\">\n<p id=\"b379-16\">. On April 17, 1996, a majority of this court held that Florida's Third Congressional District did not pass strict scrutiny because it was a racially gerrymandered district not narrowly tailored to further a compelling governmental interest. <em>Johnson v. Mortham, </em>926 F.Supp. 1460, 1495 (N.D.Fla. 1996) (three-judge panel). On the same date, the clerk entered judgment for Plaintiffs. See doc. 193. Under Rule 54(d)(1), Fed.R.Civ.P., the judgment winner is the \"prevailing party.\u201d <em>See Head v. Medford, </em>62 F.3d 351, 354-55 (11th Cir.1995).</p>\n</footnote>\n<footnote label=\"2\">\n<p id=\"b381-6\">. In <em>Bonner v. City of Prichard, </em>661 F.2d 1206, 1207 (11th Cir.1981) (en banc), the Eleventh Circuit adopted as precedent the decisions of the Fifth Circuit rendered prior to October 1, 1981.</p>\n</footnote>\n<footnote label=\"3\">\n<p id=\"b381-7\">. As discussed in the next paragraph, Plaintiffs\u2019 motion for reconsideration may also be construed as a motion for retaxation of costs. Motions for retaxation of cost are also subject to the abuse of discretion standard of review. <em>See Dickinson Supply, Inc. v. Montana-Dakota Util. Co., </em>423 F.2d 106, 110 (8th Cir.1970).</p>\n</footnote>\n<footnote label=\"4\">\n<p id=\"b381-11\">. The United States has correctly pointed out two deficiencies in the documentation which Plaintiffs untimely submitted to the court. First, while Plaintiffs seek over $10,000 in taxable costs, they have only supplied documentation for $3,094.38 of the costs they purportedly incurred. Second, a substantial portion of Plaintiffs\u2019 documented costs are not taxable under 28 U.S.C. \u00a7 1920.</p>\n</footnote>\n<footnote label=\"5\">\n<p id=\"b382-7\">. A party claiming taxable costs must verify that the claimed items are correct and have been necessarily incurred in the case and that any services for which fees have been charged were actually and necessarily performed. 28 U.S.C. \u00a7 1924. <em>See also </em>28 U.S.C. \u00a7 1746 (providing for verification through unsworn declarations under penalty of perjury). Plaintiffs' counsel made the requisite verification in the bill of costs-by signing an oath reciting the language from 28 U.S.C. \u00a7 1924 (doc. 202). <em>See Trammell, </em>748 F.2d at 1518.</p>\n</footnote>\n<footnote label=\"6\">\n<p id=\"b382-9\">. A copy of schedule A to Plaintiffs' counsel's verified statement is provided as Appendix A to this opinion.</p>\n</footnote>\n<footnote label=\"7\">\n<p id=\"b382-13\">. Plaintiffs may have actually paid the additional sum of $60.50 to the clerk. However, Plaintiffs have neither provided the dates these additional sums were paid, nor explained why they were paid. Absent such information, it would place an onerous burden on the clerk\u2019s office to search through all of its receipts to determine the validity of Plaintiffs\u2019 claimed amounts. Without question, the burden of producing documentation in support of a bill of costs is on the claimant, not the clerk.</p>\n</footnote>\n<footnote label=\"8\">\n<p id=\"b383-5\">. <em>See Fairley v. Patterson, </em>493 F.2d 598, 607 n. 17 (5th Cir.1974) (\u201cIn public interest litigation, especially, where an attorney may donate his legal talents, the expenses of preparing and conducting the litigation require direct out-of-pocket expenditures by a party, which should be completely recoverable.\u201d); <em>but see United States v. Bedford Assoc., </em>548 F.Supp. 748, 753 (S.D.N.Y.1982) (disallowing attorney\u2019s out-of-pocket travel expenses) (collecting citations).</p>\n</footnote>\n<footnote label=\"9\">\n<p id=\"b383-6\">. At least two courts have held that an attorney\u2019s affidavit can be sufficient to satisfy the requirements of 28 U.S.C. \u00a7 1821(c)(1). <em>See Holmes v. Cessna Aircraft Co., </em>11 F.3d 63, 65 (5th Cir.1994) (per curiam); <em>National Bancard Corp. </em>v. VISA, <em>U.S.A., Inc., </em>112 F.R.D. 62, 69 (S.D.Fla.1986). However, in each of those cases, the attorney seeking reimbursement for travel expenses (1) swore under penalty of perjury that the travel expenses claimed were necessary to the litigation and (2) provided either a detailed itemization of the expenses actually incurred or documentation of costs for the \"most economical rate reasonably available\u201d under the terms of \u00a7 1821. To the extent that Plaintiffs\u2019 bill of costs may be construed as an affidavit, it fails to sufficiently meet the second of these requirements.</p>\n</footnote>\n<footnote label=\"10\">\n<p id=\"b384-7\">. As has already been discussed at great length, the bill of costs form submitted by Plaintiffs\u2019 counsel included the requirement that supporting documentation also be submitted. In addition, 28 U.S.C. \u00a7 1821 mandates that receipts of all travel expenses be submitted with any request for such expenses as taxable costs. Under these circumstances, it cannot be said that Plaintiffs\u2019 counsel did not have sufficient notice of the conditions precedent to obtaining an award of taxable costs.</p>\n</footnote>\n</opinion>\n</casebody>\n",
