The evidence showed that the personal property<footnotemark>1</footnotemark> was worth approximately $28,000 and that the family home had a net worth of like amount. Husband received the bulk of the personal property and the home, subject to a lien on the home in favor of the wife in the sum of $12,500 payable not later than August 1, 1981. Both parties were ordered to pay certain debts incurred prior to separation. Husband was ordered to pay $40 per month child support. The wife contends that the property division was inequitable. During opening statements, counsel for both parties had suggested that the property be \"divided 50-50\u201d and wife asked for child support under a proposed split custody of the two children.</p>\n<p id=\"b55-4\">We do not think that the trial court\u2019s award to the wife was sufficient. <em>McCoy and McCoy, </em>28 Or App 919, 927-28, 562 P2d 207 (1977).
