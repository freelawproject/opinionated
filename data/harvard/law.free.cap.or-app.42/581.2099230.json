They applied for and received unemployment benefits for the periods of July 4, 1976, through October 16, 1976, October 24, 1976, through January 8, 1977, and May 14, 1977, through June 25, 1977. A subsequent administrator\u2019s decision determined that petitioners were not unemployed or available for work during the periods in question and were, therefore, ineligible for benefits. They were further found to have wilfully failed to report a material fact \u2014 their alleged continuing employment with their corporations \u2014 so that they were disqualified from receiving compensation for 26 weeks<footnotemark>1</footnotemark> and were required to repay the benefits they had received. They seek review. We reverse and remand.</p>\n<p id=\"b637-4\">Petitioners\u2019 first assignment of error \u2014 and the only one we consider \u2014 is the Board\u2019s conclusion that petitioners were not \"unemployed\u201d under ORS 657.100.<footnotemark>2</footnotemark> Under ORS 657.100 a person is \"unemployed\u201d if he performs no services for compensation. The key consideration is that he receive no compensation. <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"584\">*584</page-number><em>Taylor v. Emp. Div., </em>286 Or 711, 597 P2d 780 (1979). It is undisputed that petitioners were not paid for the services they performed for their corporations during the periods in question. <em>Taylor </em>would appear to be dispositive.</p>\n<p id=\"b638-3\">The state, however, argues that <em>Taylor </em>may be distinguished from the present case: in <em>Taylor, </em>the claimant took compensation from his corporation only for services he performed as a logger-employe. Here, by contrast, the state claims that petitioners took their compensation as corporate officers. Even if the state\u2019s characterization of the manner in which the petitioners were paid were taken as correct \u2014 and the Board made no finding on this point \u2014 we find the purported distinction unpersuasive. The petitioners\u2019 activities on behalf of the corporations here \u2014 checking the mail, answering correspondence and the like\u2014 sufficiently parallels the claimant\u2019s efforts to obtain business for his corporation in <em>Taylor </em>so that no valid legal distinction may be made between the two cases.</p>\n<p id=\"b638-4\">The state further argues that, because petitioners elect to pay themself only once per year for the full year\u2019s work, their income cannot be attributed to any particular period during the year and so they must be deemed to be employed all year. However, as the Supreme Court noted in <em>Taylor,</em></p>\n<blockquote id=\"b638-5\">\". . . The state argues that because claimant is self-employed and, due to his corporate position, makes the decision of when to work, when to lay himself off, <em>when to get paid and how to get paid, </em>his unemployment is not 'through no fault of his own.\u2019 These assertions, however, go to questions presented by ORS 657.155 concerning eligibility for benefits and ORS 657.176 concerning various reasons for disqualification from benefits, not to the question presented by ORS 657.100. . . of whether one is unemployed when he performs uncompensated services.\" 286 Or at 720. (Emphasis supplied.)</blockquote>\n<p id=\"b638-7\">The state in the present case repeats the error it made in <em>Taylor: </em>whatever its pertinence may be under <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"585\">*585</page-number>other portions of the unemployment compensation law, the fact that the petitioners here could control the timing of their compensation did not mean that they were <em>employed </em>all year. The Board\u2019s ruling that the petitioners were \"not unemployed\u201d was error.</p>\n<p id=\"b639-3\">Because of our holding on petitioners\u2019 first assignment of error and because the Board clearly relied on an impermissible view of the meaning of ORS 657.100, we are not required to reach the further question, posed by petitioners\u2019 second assignment of error, of whether there is substantial evidence in the record to support the Board\u2019s finding that petitioners wilfully failed to report a material fact in order to obtain benefits.</p>\n<p id=\"b639-4\">Reversed and remanded.</p>\n<footnote label=\"1\">\n<p id=\"b637-5\"> The final order of the EAB provided that the disqualification was \"for a period not to exceed 26 weeks.\u201d The order further provided that the referee\u2019s decision in the case was \"affirmed.\u201d The referee had ordered disqualification \"for 26 otherwise compensable weeks.\u201d This latter formulation is incorrect: disqualification under the statute as it then existed must be for 26 consecutive weeks, rather than 26 \"otherwise compensable\u201d weeks. <em>See Employment Division v. Bechtel, </em>36 Or App 831, 585 P2d 769 (1978). In their brief, petitioners assign error to the Board\u2019s order, treating it as if it were written in the same language as the referee\u2019s opinion. The state\u2019s brief seems to agree, because it confesses error on this point. We, however, read the phrase in question as conforming to our interpretation of the appropriate statute in <em>Bechtel </em>and find no error. Our interpretation is aided by the concurring opinion of one member of the Board, who pointed out the <em>Bechtel </em>problem.</p>\n</footnote>\n<footnote label=\"2\">\n<p id=\"b637-6\"> \"ORS 657.100.
