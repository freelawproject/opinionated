At the time Vargas\u2019 judgment of conviction was entered on the docket, the Federal Rules of Appellate Procedure required a defendant in a criminal case to file his notice of appeal within ten days of the entry of judgment. Fed. R.App. P. 4(b)(l)(A)(i). With or without a motion, upon a showing of excusable neglect or good cause, the district court may grant an extension of up to thirty days to file a notice of appeal. Fed. R.App. P. 4(b)(4); <em>United States v. Reyes, </em>759 F.2d 351, 353 (4th Cir.1985).</p>\n<p id=\"b270-21\">The district court entered judgment on September 24, 2008. Vargas filed his notice of appeal, at the earliest, on December 30, 2013.<footnotemark>1</footnotemark> Because Vargas failed to file a timely notice of appeal or to obtain an extension of the appeal period, we dismiss the appeal as untimely.<footnotemark>2</footnotemark> We dispense with oral argument because the facts and legal contentions are adequately presented in the materials before this court.</p>\n<p id=\"b270-22\">\n<em>DISMISSED.</em>\n</p>\n<footnote label=\"1\">\n<p id=\"b270-18\">. Vargas stated in his notice of appeal that he submitted it on December 30, 2013. We presume that this date is the earliest date it could have been delivered to prison officials for mailing to the court. Fed. R.App. P. 4(c)(1); <em>Houston v. Lack, </em>487 U.S. 266, 276, 108 S.Ct. 2379, 101 L.Ed.2d 245 (1988).</p>\n</footnote>\n<footnote label=\"2\">\n<p id=\"b270-19\">. We note that the appeal period in a criminal case is not a jurisdictional provision, but, rather, a claim-processing rule. <em>Bowles v. Russell, </em>551 U.S. 205, 209-14, 127 S.Ct. 2360, 168 L.Ed.2d 96 (2007); <em>United States v. Urutyan, </em>564 F.3d 679, 685 (4th Cir.2009). Because Vargas\u2019 appeal is inordinately late, and its consideration is not in the best interest of judicial economy, we exercise our inherent power to dismiss it. <em>United States v. Mitchell, </em>518 F.3d 740, 744, 750 (10th Cir.2008).</p>\n</footnote>\n</opinion>\n</casebody>\n",
