(\u201cWexford\u201d),<footnotemark>*</footnotemark> and two prison officials. <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"295\">*295</page-number>The district court dismissed the complaint against one prison official, granted summary judgment to the remaining Defendants, and directed the Clerk to amend the docket to include a new Defendant \u2014 Corizon Medical Services (\u201cCorizon\u201d). Toomer appeals this order, and the DPSCS and the prison officials have moved to dismiss the appeal as interlocutory.</p>\n<p id=\"b323-5\">This court may exercise jurisdiction only over final orders, 28 U.S.C. \u00a7 1291 (2012), and certain interlocutory and collateral orders, 28 U.S.C. \u00a7 1292 (2012); Fed. R.Civ.P. 54(b); <em>Cohen v. Beneficial Indus. Loan Corp., </em>337 U.S. 541, 545-46, 69 S.Ct. 1221, 93 L.Ed. 1528 (1949). The order Toomer seeks to appeal is neither a final order nor an appealable interlocutory or collateral order, as the claims against Corizon remain pending in the district court. Accordingly, we grant the motion to dismiss the appeal as interlocutory. Although the remaining Defendants did not move to dismiss, we nevertheless dismiss the appeal in its entirety, as we do not have jurisdiction over this interlocutory appeal. <em>See Dickens v. Aetna Life Ins. Co., </em>677 F.3d 228, 229-30 (4th Cir.2012) (holding that this court is required to inquire into its jurisdiction sua sponte). Finally, we deny Toomer\u2019s pending motions.</p>\n<p id=\"b323-6\">We dispense with oral argument because the facts and legal contentions are adequately presented in the materials before this court and argument would not aid the decisional process.</p>\n<p id=\"b323-7\">\n<em>DISMISSED.</em>\n</p>\n<footnote label=\"*\">\n<p id=\"b322-11\"> Although the district court\u2019s docket and our docket both designate the corporation as \"Wexford Medical Health Care Provider,\u201d Wexford states that the correct name of the corporation is Wexford Health Sources, Inc.</p>\n</footnote>\n</opinion>\n</casebody>\n",
