The parties stipulated in the plea agreement to a 170-month prison sentence. <em>See </em>Fed.R.Crim.P. 11(c)(1)(C). The district court accepted McWhite\u2019s guilty plea pursuant to the plea agreement and sentenced him to 170 months\u2019 imprisonment.</p>\n<p id=\"b219-10\">On appeal, McWhite\u2019s counsel has filed a brief pursuant to <em>Anders v. California, </em>386 U.S. 738, 87 S.Ct. 1396, 18 L.Ed.2d 493 (1967), stating that there are no meritorious issues for appeal, but raising as issues for review whether the district court complied with Fed.R.Crim.P. 11 in accepting McWhite\u2019s guilty plea and whether the 170-month prison sentence is reasonable. McWhite was informed of his right to file a pro se supplemental brief, but he has not done so. The Government declined to file a brief. We affirm in part and dismiss in part.</p>\n<p id=\"b219-11\">Because McWhite did not move in the district court to withdraw his guilty plea, the adequacy of the Fed.R.Crim.P. 11 hearing is reviewed for plain error only. <em>United States v. Martinez, </em>277 F.3d 517, 524-27 (4th Cir.2002). To demonstrate plain error, a defendant must show: (1) there was error; (2) the error was plain; and (3) the error affected his substantial rights. <em>United States v. Olano, </em>507 U.S. 725, 732, 113 S.Ct. 1770, 123 L.Ed.2d 508 (1993). In the guilty plea context, a defendant meets his burden to establish that a plain error affected his substantial rights by showing a reasonable probability that he would not have pled guilty but for the district court\u2019s Rule 11 omissions. <em>United States v. Massenburg, </em>564 F.3d 337, 343 (4th Cir.2009).</p>\n<p id=\"b219-13\">Our review of the transcript of the guilty plea hearing leads us to conclude that the district court substantially complied with the mandates of Rule 11 in accepting McWhite\u2019s guilty plea and that the court\u2019s omissions did not affect McWhite\u2019s substantial rights. Critically, the transcript reveals that the district court ensured that the plea was supported by an independent basis in fact, and that McWhite entered the plea knowingly and voluntarily with an understanding of the consequences. <em>United States v. DeFusco, </em>949 F.2d 114, 116, 120 (4th Cir.1991). Accordingly, we discern no plain error in the district court\u2019s acceptance of McWhite\u2019s guilty plea.</p>\n<p id=\"b219-14\">Counsel also questions whether McWhite\u2019s 170-month prison sentence is reasonable. We conclude that we lack jurisdiction to review this challenge. McWhite entered his guilty plea pursuant to Fed.R.Crim.P. 11(e)(1)(C). The federal statute governing appellate review of a sentence limits the circumstances under which a defendant may appeal a sentence to which he stipulated in a Rule 11(c)(1)(C) plea agreement to claims that the district court imposed the sentence \u201cin violation of law ... [or] as a result of an incorrect application of the [Sentencing [Guidelines.\u201d 18 U.S.C. \u00a7 3742(a)(l)-(2), (c) (2012); <em>United States v. Sanchez, </em>146 F.3d 796, 797 &amp; n. 1 (10th Cir.1998) (concerning Rule 11(e)(1)(C), the predecessor provision <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"192\">*192</page-number>to Rule 11(c)(1)(C)). McWhite\u2019s 170-month sentence does not exceed the applicable statutory maximum, <em>see </em>21 U.S.C. \u00a7 841(b)(1)(A), was not based upon the Sentencing Guidelines, and was the sentence for which he had bargained. <em>See United States v. Cieslowski, </em>410 F.3d 353, 364 (7th Cir.2005) (\u201cA sentence imposed under a Rule 11(c)(1)(C) plea arises directly from the agreement itself, not from the Guidelines.\u201d). Review of McWhite\u2019s 170-month sentence is thus precluded by 18 U.S.C. \u00a7 3742(c).</p>\n<p id=\"b220-4\">Finally, in accordance with <em>Anders, </em>we have reviewed the remainder of the record in this case and have found no meritorious issues for appeal. We therefore affirm McWhite\u2019s conviction and dismiss the appeal of his sentence. This court requires that counsel inform McWhite, in writing, of the right to petition the Supreme Court of the United States for further review. If McWhite requests that a petition be filed, but counsel believes that such a petition would be frivolous, then counsel may move in this court for leave to withdraw from representation. Counsel\u2019s motion must state that a copy thereof was served on McWhite.</p>\n<p id=\"b220-5\">We dispense with oral argument because the facts and legal contentions are adequately presented in the materials before this court and argument would not aid the decisional process.</p>\n<p id=\"b220-6\">\n<em>AFFIRMED IN PART; DISMISSED IN PART.</em>\n</p>\n</opinion>\n</casebody>\n",
