Taverniti appeals the district court\u2019s judgment dismissing for lack of subject matter jurisdiction Taverniti\u2019s action challenging the Commissioner of Social Security\u2019s denial of her 2008 request for reconsideration of the agency\u2019s 1991 termination of her disability insurance benefits. We have jurisdiction under 28 U.S.C. \u00a7 1291, and we affirm.</p>\n<p id=\"b673-24\">The agency denied as untimely Taverniti\u2019s request for agency reconsideration and her request for a hearing before an administrative law judge (\u201cALJ\u201d). Because Taverniti did not obtain an administrative hearing prior to filing her complaint in district court, she failed to exhaust administrative remedies as required by 42 U.S.C. \u00a7 405(g). <em>See </em>20 C.F.R. \u00a7 404.900(a)(5); <em>Dexter v. Colvin, </em>731 F.3d 977, 980 (9th Cir.2013); <em>Bass v. Soc. Sec. Admin., </em>872 F.2d 832, 833 (9th Cir.1989) (per curiam).</p>\n<p id=\"b673-25\">The district court properly held that both the agency\u2019s denial of Taverniti\u2019s request for reconsideration as untimely and the AL J\u2019s denial of her request for a hearing as untimely were non-final decisions that were not subject to judicial review. <em>See Dexter, </em>731 F.3d at 980 (\u201cBecause [the <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"646\">*646</page-number>agency\u2019s] decision whether ... to entertain untimely hearing request or reopen an earlier application is strictly discretionary, ... it is not final and thus not generally reviewable by a district court.\u201d (citations omitted)). Taverniti contends that the district court nonetheless had jurisdiction because the AL J\u2019s denial of her request for a hearing deprived her of due process and wrongfully prevented her from obtaining review of the denial of reconsideration. This contention lacks merit because the ALJ provided an explanation for the denial of Taverniti\u2019s request for a hearing. <em>See id. </em>at 981-82.</p>\n<p id=\"b674-4\">We decline to address Taverniti\u2019s argument, raised for the first time on appeal, that the district court should have waived the exhaustion requirement and addressed the merits of the agency\u2019s denial of her request for reconsideration. <em>See Greger v. Barnhart, </em>464 F.3d 968, 973 (9th Cir.2006).</p>\n<p id=\"b674-5\">AFFIRMED.</p>\n<footnote label=\"**\">\n<p id=\"b673-26\"> This disposition is not appropriate for publication and is not precedent except as provided by 9th Cir.
