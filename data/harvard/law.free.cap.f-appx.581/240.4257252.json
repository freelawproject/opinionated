On appeal, Mitchell contends that the district court\u2019s sentence was plainly unreasonable. Finding no error, we affirm.</p>\n<p id=\"b269-11\">The district court has broad discretion to impose a sentence after revoking a defendant\u2019s supervised release. <em>United States v. Webb, </em>738 F.3d 638, 640 (4th Cir.2013). Thus, we assume \u201ca deferential appellate posture concerning issues of fact and the exercise of [that] discretion.\u201d <em>United States v. Crudup, </em>461 F.3d 433, 439 (4th Cir.2006) (internal quotation marks omitted).</p>\n<p id=\"b269-12\">We must \u201cfirst decide whether the sentence is unreasonable.\u201d <em>Id. </em>at 438. In doing so, \u201cwe follow generally the procedural and substantive considerations\u201d employed in reviewing original sentences. Id. A sentence is proeedurally reasonable if the district court has considered the advisory policy statements contained in Chapter 7 of the <em>U.S. Sentencing Guidelines Manual </em>and the applicable 18 U.S.C. \u00a7 3553(a) (2012) factors, <em>id. </em>at 439, and has provided some explanation for the sentence chosen. <em>United States v. Thompson, </em>595 F.3d 544, 547 (4th Cir.2010). A sentence is substantively reasonable if the court states a proper basis for concluding that the defendant should receive the sentence imposed, up to the statutory maximum. <em>Crudup, </em>461 F.3d at 440. Only if we find a sentence to be proeedurally or substantively unreasonable will we consider whether the sentence is \u201cplainly\u201d unreasonable. <em>Id. </em>at 439.</p>\n<p id=\"b269-14\">Applying our deferential standard of review, we conclude that Mitchell\u2019s sentence was not unreasonable, much less plainly so. The district court has \u201cbroad discretion to ... impose a term of imprisonment up to the statutory maximum.\u201d <em>Crudup, </em>461 F.3d at 439 (internal quotation marks omitted). Given the facts of this case, we conclude that the district court did not abuse its broad discretion in imposing the statutory maximum of twenty-four months\u2019 imprisonment upon revocation of Mitchell\u2019s term of supervised release.</p>\n<p id=\"b269-15\">Accordingly, we affirm the district court\u2019s judgment. We dispense with oral argument because the facts and legal contentions are adequately presented in the materials before this court and argument would not aid the decisional process.</p>\n<p id=\"b269-16\">\n<em>AFFIRMED.</em>\n</p>\n</opinion>\n</casebody>\n",
