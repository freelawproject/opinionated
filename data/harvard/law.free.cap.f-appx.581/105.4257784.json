After being sentenced in 2003, defendant was resentenced in 2012, with the term of imprisonment and the amount of restitution reduced. At the time of the resentencing, defendant had already completed her incarceration. On May 22, 2013, defendant sought a writ of error coram nobis to vacate her conviction. The District Court denied her motion and judgment was entered on November 15, 2013. On appeal, defendant contends that (1) the District Court erred in not providing her with a full evidentiary hearing before denying her motion for a writ of error coram nobis, and that (2) she was denied effective assistance of counsel because her trial counsel deprived her of her right to testify at trial. We assume the parties\u2019 familiarity with the underlying facts and the procedural history of the case.</p>\n<p id=\"b134-5\">DISCUSSION</p>\n<p id=\"b134-6\">A. Denial of Evidentiary Hearing</p>\n<p id=\"b134-7\">We review a district court\u2019s denial of a hearing for abuse of discretion. <em>Chang v. United States, </em>250 F.3d 79, 82 (2d Cir. 2001). 28 U.S.C. \u00a7 2255 requires the district court to hold a hearing \u201c[ujnless the motion and the files and records of the case conclusively show that the prisoner is entitled to no relief.\u201d<footnotemark>1</footnotemark> However, a district court need not conduct a \u201cfull-blown testimonial hearing,\u201d as it is \u201cwithin the district court\u2019s discretion to choose a middle road\u201d that adequately expands the record without \u201cthe needless expenditure of judicial resources.\u201d <em>Chang, </em>250 F.3d at 86 (holding that even if the affidavits of petitioner and defense counsel are contradictory, the district court need not conduct a hearing where live testimony would not alter its view of the facts). Indeed, the trial judge is in the best position to determine the scope of a hearing because that judge is \u201cintimately familiar\u201d with the underlying criminal proceedings. <em>Puglisi v. United States, </em>586 F.3d 209, 215 (2d Cir.2009).</p>\n<p id=\"b134-10\">Here, the District Court reasonably decided that the testimony of Foster and her trial counsel would be little more than a \u201cswearing match\u201d and add little or nothing to the written affidavits. Contrary to Foster\u2019s claim, this was not a summary dismissal by the District Court. Judge Glee-son carefully considered the value of a full hearing and ultimately relied upon the trial counsel\u2019s credible affidavit in deciding that it was not necessary. As we have previously held, an affidavit from the petitioner\u2019s trial counsel \u201ccredibly describing the circumstances concerning appellant\u2019s failure to testify ... was sufficient to support dismissal of the petition.\u201d <em>Chang, </em>250 F.3d at 85. Therefore, we conclude that the district court acted within its discretion in declining to hold a full hearing on Foster\u2019s motion.</p>\n<p id=\"b134-11\">B. Ineffective Assistance of Counsel</p>\n<p id=\"b134-12\">\u201cWe review <em>de novo </em>the standards that a District Court applies in considering the writ of error <em>coram nobis </em>and review for abuse of discretion a District Court\u2019s final decision to deny the writ.\u201d <em>Porcelli v. United States, </em>404 F.3d 157, 158 (2d Cir. <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"107\">*107</page-number>2005). To prevail on a claim of ineffective assistance of counsel, a defendant must demonstrate that her counsel\u2019s conduct \u201cfell below an objective standard of reasonableness\u201d and \u201caffirmatively prove prejudice,\u201d showing that \u201cbut for counsel\u2019s unprofessional errors, the result of the proceeding would have been different.\u201d <em>Strickland v. Washington, </em>466 U.S. 668, 693, 694, 104 S.Ct. 2052, 80 L.Ed.2d 674 (1984).</p>\n<p id=\"b135-5\">Here, Foster failed to establish that her counsel performed deficiently. As noted above, the District Court did not abuse its discretion in relying upon the credible affidavit of her trial counsel. In his affidavit, Foster\u2019s trial counsel averred that he warned her of the risks of testifying, including the possible \u201cexposure for obstruction of justice in the event she was found guilty.\u201d Foster\u2019s trial counsel also noted that he told the defendant that it \u201cwas her decision as to whether or not she wants to take the stand.\u201d Her counsel concluded his sworn statement by noting that he \u201cdid not rest without her knowing that she would not testify.\u201d</p>\n<p id=\"b135-7\">Foster \u201cmust produce something more than a[n] ... unsubstantiated, thoroughly self-serving, and none too plausible statement that [her] lawyer (in violation of professional standards) forbade [her] to take the stand.\u201d <em>United States v. Castillo, </em>14 F.3d 802, 805 (2d Cir.1994) (internal quotation marks omitted). Because she fails to do so, her ineffective assistance of counsel claim is without merit.</p>\n<p id=\"b135-8\">CONCLUSION</p>\n<p id=\"b135-9\">Accordingly, we AFFIRM the judgment of the District Court.</p>\n<footnote label=\"1\">\n<p id=\"b134-8\">. Although Foster sought a writ of error co-ram nobis under 28 U.S.C. \u00a7 1651, we have stated that, \" \u2018[b]ecause of the similarities between coram nobis proceedings and \u00a7 2255 proceedings, the \u00a7 2255 procedure often is applied by analogy in coram nobis cases.'\" <em>United States v. Mandanici, </em>205 F.3d 519, 527 (2d Cir.2000) (quoting <em>Fleming v. United States, </em>146 F.3d 88, 90 n. 2 (2d Cir. 1998)).</p>\n</footnote>\n</opinion>\n</casebody>\n",
