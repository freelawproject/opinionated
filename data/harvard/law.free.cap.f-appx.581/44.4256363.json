Butler argues that the sentence was substantively unreasonable. We assume the parties\u2019 familiarity with the underlying facts, the procedural history, and the issues presented for review.</p>\n<p id=\"b72-17\">\u201cThe standard of review on the appeal of a sentence for violation of supervised release is now the same standard as for sentencing generally: whether the sentence imposed is reasonable.\u201d <em>United States v. McNeil, </em>415 F.3d 273, 277 (2d Cir.2005). \u201cReview for \u2018unreasonableness\u2019 amounts to review for abuse of discretion.\u201d <em>United States v. Cavera, </em>550 F.3d 180, 187 (2d Cir.2008) (en banc). The concept of reasonableness \u201capplies to both \u2018the sentence itself and to \u2018the procedures employed in arriving at the sentence.\u2019 \u201d <em>United States v. Verkhoglyad, </em>516 F.3d 122, 127 (2d Cir.2008) (quoting <em>United States v. Fernandez, </em>443 F.3d 19, 26 (2d Cir.2006)). \u201cThe procedural inquiry focuses primarily on the sentencing court\u2019s compliance with its statutory obligation to consider the factors detailed in 18 U.S.C. \u00a7 3553(a), while the substantive inquiry assesses the length of the sentence imposed in light of the \u00a7 3558(a) factors.\u201d <em>Id. </em>(internal citations, brackets, and quotation marks omitted).</p>\n<p id=\"b72-18\">Butler challenges only substantive reasonableness. \u201c[W]hen conducting substantive review, we take into account the totality of the circumstances, giving due deference to the sentencing judge\u2019s exercise of discretion, and bearing in mind the institutional advantages of district courts.\u201d <em>Cavera, </em>550 F.3d at 190. \u201c[W]e will not substitute our own judgment for the dis<page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"45\">*45</page-number>trict court\u2019s on the question of what is sufficient to meet the \u00a7 3553(a) considerations in any particular case\u201d and \u201cwill instead set aside a district court\u2019s substantive determination only in exceptional cases where the trial court\u2019s decision cannot be located within the range of permissible decisions.\u201d <em>Id. </em>at 189 (internal citations and quotation marks omitted).</p>\n<p id=\"b73-5\">Applying this standard, we cannot say that the district court\u2019s 18-month sentence constituted an abuse of discretion. This was the second time Butler breached the conditions of his supervised release by violating the state-issued order of protection entered in favor of his girlfriend. At the revocation hearing, Butler admitted that he \u201cviolated the order by going to the residence of the protected person and yelling at her and remaining on the front porch until the police arrived, at which time [he] ran from the police\u201d and that he was convicted of a state felony as a result. Under these circumstances, we cannot say that the district court\u2019s sentence was substantively unreasonable.</p>\n<p id=\"b73-6\">Butler argues that the sentence must be reversed because the district court failed to specifically address some of the arguments that were made at the revocation hearing. However, \u201cwe never have required a District Court to make specific responses to points argued by counsel in connection with sentencing.\u201d <em>United States v. Bonilla, </em>618 F.3d 102, 111 (2d Cir.2010). So long as the district court \u201chas considered the party\u2019s arguments and has articulated a reasonable basis for exercising its decision-making authority,\u201d nothing more is required. <em>Id. </em>Here, the district court more than satisfied this standard.</p>\n<p id=\"b73-7\">For the foregoing reasons, and finding no merit in APPELLANT\u2019S other arguments, we hereby AFFIRM the judgment of the district court.</p>\n</opinion>\n</casebody>\n",
