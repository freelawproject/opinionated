Counsel filed a brief pursuant to Anders <em>v. California, </em>386 U.S. 738, 87 S.Ct. 1396, 18 L.Ed.2d 493 (1967), asserting that there are no meritorious issues for appeal but raising for the court\u2019s consideration whether Lorenzo\u2019s guilty pleas were knowing and voluntary and whether the court should have granted his motion to withdraw the pleas. Lorenzo has filed a pro se supplemental brief challenging the sentence. The Government did not file a brief. We affirm.</p>\n<p id=\"b335-23\">We have reviewed Lorenzo\u2019s guilty plea hearing and conclude that the district court fully complied with the requirements of Fed.R.Crim.P. 11. We also conclude that the district court did not abuse its discretion in denying Lorenzo\u2019s motion to withdraw his guilty plea. Accordingly, we affirm the convictions.</p>\n<p id=\"b335-24\">We review any criminal sentence for reasonableness under a deferential abuse-of-diseretion standard. <em>Gall v. United States, </em>552 U.S. 38, 51, 128 S.Ct. 586, 169 L.Ed.2d 445 (2007); <em>United States v. Riv</em><page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"308\">*308</page-number><em>era-Santana, </em>668 F.8d 95, 100 (4th Cir. 2012). The first step requires that we ensure that the district court committed no significant procedural error such as failing to calculate (or improperly calculating) the Sentencing Guidelines range, treating the Guidelines as mandatory, failing to consider the 18 U.S.C. \u00a7 3558(a) factors, selecting a sentence based on clearly erroneous facts, or failing to adequately explain the chosen sentence \u2014 including an explanation for any deviation from the Guidelines range. <em>Gall, </em>552 U.S. at 51, 128 S.Ct. 586; <em>United States v. Carter, </em>564 F.3d 325, 328-29 (4th Cir.2009). If we conclude that a sentence is free of significant procedural error, we then consider the substantive reasonableness of the sentence. <em>United States v. Lynn, </em>592 F.3d 572, 575 (4th Cir .2010).</p>\n<p id=\"b336-4\">Our review of the record shows no procedural error. We conclude that the sentence was procedurally and substantively reasonable. We have considered Lorenzo\u2019s challenges to his sentence and found them to be without merit. We note that the rule announced in <em>Alleyne v. United States, </em>\u2014 U.S.-, 133 S.Ct. 2151, 186 L.Ed.2d 314 (2013) has no bearing on Lorenzo\u2019s sentence.</p>\n<p id=\"b336-7\">In accordance with <em>Anders, </em>we have reviewed the record in this case and have found no meritorious issues for appeal. We therefore affirm Lorenzo\u2019s convictions and sentence. This court requires that counsel inform Lorenzo, in writing, of the right to petition the Supreme Court of the United States for further review. If Lorenzo requests that a petition be filed, but counsel believes that such a petition would be frivolous, then counsel may move in this court for leave to withdraw from representation. Counsel\u2019s motion must state that a copy thereof was served on Lorenzo.</p>\n<p id=\"b336-8\">We dispense with oral argument because the facts and legal contentions are adequately presented in the materials before this court and argument would not aid the decisional process.</p>\n<p id=\"b336-10\">\n<em>AFFIRMED.</em>\n</p>\n</opinion>\n</casebody>\n",
