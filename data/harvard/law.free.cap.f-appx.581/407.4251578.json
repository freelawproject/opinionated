Jordan claims <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"408\">*408</page-number>the court lost jurisdiction to do so because the term had expired before the warrant was issued. The statute, 18 U.S.C. \u00a7 358S(i), states that the power of the court extends for any period necessary for adjudication if \u201cbefore its expiration, a warrant or summons has issued.\u201d This warrant was issued on October 2, and the supervised release term ended the following day. Jordan complains that the clerk signed the warrant and not the judge. The clerk did sign it at the direction of the judge. Nothing more was required. The warrant was issued as the statute required.</p>\n<p id=\"b436-4\">AFFIRMED.</p>\n<footnote label=\"*\">\n<p id=\"b435-26\"> Pursuant to 5th Cir.
