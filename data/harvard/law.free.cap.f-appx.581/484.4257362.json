(\u201cLane\u2019s End\u201d) arose following this Court\u2019s remand to the district court to determine whether subsequent events mooted the issues KNC raised in its prior appeal. <em>See KNC Invs., LLC v. Lane\u2019s End Stallions, Inc., </em>504 Fed.Appx. 467, 467-68 (6th Cir.2012). On remand, the district court found that no live case or controversy remained and accordingly granted Lane\u2019s End\u2019s motion to dismiss the case for lack of subject-matter jurisdiction pursuant to Federal Rule of Civil Procedure 12(b)(1). For the following reasons, we AFFIRM the judgment of the district court.</p>\n<p id=\"b513-19\">I.</p>\n<p id=\"b513-20\">Lane\u2019s End serves as Syndicate Manager for the owners of interests in the Lem<page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"486\">*486</page-number>on Drop Kid Syndicate (\u201cthe Syndicate\u201d). Lemon Drop Kid is a Thoroughbred horse. The agreement establishing the Syndicate transferred ownership of Lemon Drop Kid from the original, single owner into syndicate form to provide for the horse\u2019s management and supervision. The Syndicate consists of forty equal fractional ownership interests (\u201cFractional Interests\u201d). A holder of a Fractional Interest is an Owner. Each Owner has various rights under the agreement, including breeding rights.</p>\n<p id=\"b514-4\">On February 28, 2011, KNC purchased Fractional Interest No. A05 in the Syndicate from its previous Owner. At the time of this purchase, the Original Syndicate Agreement (\u201cOriginal Agreement\u201d), effective November 30, 2000, governed the rights and responsibilities of the Owners and the Syndicate Manager. The Original Agreement contained language providing that it could be \u201caltered, amended or modified with the affirmative vote of the Owners holding 34 of the 40 Fractional Interests.\u201d</p>\n<p id=\"b514-5\">In early March of 2011, KNC began making demands of Lane\u2019s End regarding the other Owners of Fractional Interests in the Syndicate. Specifically, KNC desired to obtain the names and contact information of the other Owners. On March 8, 2011, Lane\u2019s End responded to KNC\u2019s requests. Lane\u2019s End indicated that it would seek permission from the other Owners in the Syndicate to disclose their identities and contact information pursuant to section 6.1 of the Original Agreement, which provided that a majority vote of the Owners of the Fractional Interests would decide any question submitted. All the other Owners except KNC voted against disclosing their identities and contact information, and Lane\u2019s End refused to provide such information to KNC.</p>\n<p id=\"b514-6\">After the other Owners rebuffed KNC\u2019s requests for information, on March 22, 2011, KNC filed suit against Lane\u2019s End, as Syndicate Manager, in the United States District Court for the Eastern District of Kentucky, asserting four claims for relief and seeking declaratory relief, damages, and complete accounting of the Syndicate\u2019s financial records. In November of 2011, the district court granted both Lane\u2019s End\u2019s motion to dismiss some of KNC\u2019s claims and Lane\u2019s End\u2019s motion for summary judgment as to KNC\u2019s other claims. Following the district court\u2019s denial of KNC\u2019s motion to reconsider its November 2011 decision, KNC appealed.</p>\n<p id=\"b514-8\">Before this Court adjudicated KNC\u2019s prior appeal, the other thirty-nine Owners of Fractional Interests in the Syndicate voted to amend the Original Agreement and expressly to ratify Lane\u2019s End\u2019s past actions as Syndicate Manager. Lane\u2019s End then filed a motion to dismiss KNC\u2019s appeal as moot based on the Amended Syndicate Agreement (\u201cAmended Agreement\u201d). <em>KNC Invs., </em>504 Fed.Appx. at 467. This Court remanded to the district court to determine in the first instance whether the Amended Agreement mooted KNC\u2019s claims. <em>Id. </em>at 468. On remand, the district court found that no live case or controversy remained and accordingly granted Lane\u2019s End\u2019s Rule 12(b)(1) motion to dismiss for lack of subject-matter jurisdiction. KNC again appealed to this Court.</p>\n<p id=\"b514-9\">II.</p>\n<p id=\"b514-10\">A.</p>\n<p id=\"b514-11\">In granting Lane\u2019s End\u2019s motion to dismiss for lack of subject-matter jurisdiction, the district court decided only the question of whether KNC\u2019s claims are now moot in light of the Amended Agreement. Because the district court considered only the issue of mootness on remand, we confine our review to that issue. <em>Wright v. Holbrook, </em>794 F.2d 1152, 1157 (6th Cir. <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"487\">*487</page-number>1986) (\u201c[T]he general rule is that this court will not consider issues not raised in the district court.\u201d); <em>see also Norfolk &amp; W. Ry. Co. v. City of Oregon, </em>210 F.3d 372, 2000 WL 377064, at *4 (6th Cir.2000) (Table) (\u201cThe district court limited its remand to that issue and, likewise, our review is similarly limited.\u201d (footnote omitted)).</p>\n<p id=\"b515-5\">We generally review de novo a district court\u2019s decision to dismiss for lack of subject-matter jurisdiction under Rule 12(b)(1). <em>Howard v. Whitbeck, </em>382 F.3d 633, 636 (6th Cir.2004). If the lower court, however, \u201cdoes not merely analyze the complaint on its face, but instead inquires into the factual predicates for jurisdiction, the decision on the Rule 12(b)(1) motion resolves a \u2018factual\u2019 challenge rather than a \u2018facial\u2019 challenge, and we review the district court\u2019s factual findings for clear error.\u201d <em>Id. </em>(citing <em>RMI Titanium Co. v. Westinghouse Elec. Corp., </em>78 F.3d 1125, 1133-35 (6th Cir.1996); <em>United States v. Ritchie, </em>15 F.3d 592, 598 (6th Cir.1994); <em>Ohio Nat\u2019l Life Ins. Co. v. United States, </em>922 F.2d 320, 325 (6th Cir.1990)).</p>\n<p id=\"b515-6\">Lane\u2019s End\u2019s challenge to the existence of subject-matter jurisdiction in this case is a factual one because the district court analyzed the complaint in light of the Amended Agreement, which Lane\u2019s End contends deprives the court of a \u201cfactual predicate[ ]\u201d for jurisdiction. <em>Id. </em>Language from this Court\u2019s prior order buttresses our conclusion: \u201cPerhaps this case is moot, or perhaps the new facts relate to the merits of the dispute between KNC and Lane\u2019s End. Either way, ... the district court is best suited to find any relevant facts and to determine in the first instance whether a live controversy remains.\u201d <em>KNC Invs., </em>504 Fed.Appx. at 468. We therefore review the district court\u2019s factual findings for clear error and its legal conclusions de novo. <em>See Howard, </em>382 F.3d at 636.</p>\n<p id=\"b515-7\">B.</p>\n<p id=\"b515-8\">This Court has stated that \u201c \u2018[t]he test for mootness is whether the relief sought would, if granted, make a difference to the legal interest of the parties.\u2019 \u201d <em>Wedgewood Ltd. P\u2019ship I v. Twp. of Liberty, </em>610 F.3d 340, 348 (6th Cir.2010) (quoting <em>Ford v. Wilder, </em>469 F.3d 500, 504 (6th Cir.2006)). The \u201cheavy burden of demonstrating mootness\u201d lies with the party claiming that the case is moot. <em>Cleveland Branch, NAACP v. City of Parma, </em>263 F.3d 513, 530-31 (6th Cir.2001) (citing <em>Cnty. of L.A. v. Davis, </em>440 U.S. 625, 631, 99 S.Ct. 1379, 59 L.Ed.2d 642 (1979)). We agree with the district court that Lane\u2019s End met its burden to prove the mootness of this controversy in light of the Amended Agreement, which now expressly ratifies Lane\u2019s End\u2019s past conduct.</p>\n<p id=\"b515-9\">KNC\u2019s Amended Complaint asserts four claims against Lane\u2019s End. Count I seeks a declaratory judgment regarding KNC\u2019s alleged rights to inspect the Syndicate\u2019s books and records, to an un-redacted purchase offer, and to information regarding the advancement of Syndicate funds based on the Original Agreement. Count II seeks a declaratory judgment regarding KNC\u2019s alleged right to inspect the Syndicate\u2019s books and records based on the Kentucky Business Corporations Act, Ky. Rev.Stat. Ann. \u00a7 271b.l6-020. Count III seeks compensatory and punitive damages for Lane\u2019s End\u2019s alleged violations of its fiduciary duties to the Owners of the Syndicate based on the Original Agreement. Count IV seeks a full and complete accounting of all Syndicate funds based on Kentucky\u2019s law of agency and the Original Agreement. In the prior appeal, this Court affirmed the district court\u2019s dismissal of Count II. <em>KNC Invs., </em>504 Fed.Appx. at 468 (\u2018We thus need no additional facts to conclude that the district court correctly <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"488\">*488</page-number>rejected KNC\u2019s claims under the Business Corporations Act.\u201d). The only claims remaining on remand, then, were those KNC asserted based on the Original Agreement.</p>\n<p id=\"b516-4\">Events that transpired after KNC filed its Amended Complaint, however, prevent it from asserting any claims under the Original Agreement. The other thirty-nine Owners of Fractional Interests in the Syndicate \u2014 all save for KNC \u2014 voted in May and June of 2012 to amend the Original Agreement. The Amended Agreement addresses the actions taken by Lane\u2019s End that KNC complains of in this litigation. Specifically, the language of the Amended Agreement confirms that the identities of individual Owners are confidential and Lane\u2019s End cannot disclose them absent a majority vote. The language of the Amended Agreement also expressly ratifies the actions taken by Lane\u2019s End that KNC alleges violated its rights under the Original Agreement. Kentucky law permits such ratification, even with the consent of a simple majority of the owners. <em>See Weisbord/Etkin/Goldberg v. Gainesway Mgmt. Corp., </em>No.2007-CA-000280MR, 2008 WL 820950, at *5-6 (Ky.Ct.App. Mar. 28, 2008) (\u201cThe appellants provide no convincing authority in law or in the express language of the Agreement to support the view that such a post facto approval of the transfer of one share must be approved by all the members of the syndicate.\u201d).<footnotemark>1</footnotemark></p>\n<p id=\"b516-5\">Accordingly, the district court\u2019s factual conclusion \u2014 based on the affidavit submitted by Thomas Hyams, Secretary and Treasurer of Lane\u2019s End \u2014 that the other thirty-nine Owners in the Syndicate followed the proper procedures for ratifying Lane\u2019s End\u2019s prior actions is not clearly erroneous. KNC failed to present probative evidence to the district court rebutting Hyams\u2019 affidavit, and the Amended Agreement specifically ratifies all of Lane\u2019s End\u2019s past actions. This Court thus cannot grant any relief that \u201cwould ... make a difference to the legal interest of the parties.\u201d <em>Wedgewood, </em>610 F.3d at 348 (quoting <em>Ford, </em>469 F.3d at 504).</p>\n<p id=\"b516-8\">C.</p>\n<p id=\"b516-9\">KNC nonetheless contends that the district court committed two legal errors in granting Lane\u2019s End\u2019s Rule 12(b)(1) motion to dismiss. First, KNC argues that the district court erred by denying its request for discovery on remand because KNC \u201cshould have been given an opportunity to investigate how the amendments occurred and whether Lane\u2019s End went beyond its role as Syndicate Manager in seeking and obtaining the amendments.\u201d Appellant Br. at 38. Second, KNC argues: \u201cLane\u2019s End could not effectuate an amendment to the Original Syndicate Agreement without the consent of one of its parties (KNC), especially when its attempt to do so was intended to void certain provisions of that contract that existed when KNC agreed to become a party to it.\u201d <em>Id. </em>at 42.</p>\n<p id=\"b516-10\">The district court properly rejected KNC\u2019s request for discovery. In <em>Chrysler Corp. v. Fedders Corp., </em>643 F.2d 1229 (6th Cir.1981), this Court held that whether or not to allow discovery prior to deciding a motion to dismiss for lack of jurisdiction is within the discretion of the district court. <em>Id. </em>at 1240 (\u201cA ruling by the trial court limiting or denying discovery will not be <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"489\">*489</page-number>cause for reversal unless an abuse of discretion is shown.\u201d). The instant case is analogous to <em>Chrysler Corp. </em>because KNC did not present any probative evidence to the district court to support its allegations that Lane\u2019s End acted improperly during the amendment process in May and June of 2012. <em>See id. </em>(\u201cInasmuch as Chrysler failed to offer any factual basis for its allegations of conspiracy, it was well within the trial court\u2019s discretion to deny Chrysler\u2019s request for discovery.\u201d). The district court therefore did not abuse its discretion in denying KNC\u2019s discovery request.</p>\n<p id=\"b517-5\">KNC\u2019s second' argument, that the other Owners of the Syndicate could not amend the Original Agreement without KNC\u2019s consent, lacks merit. In <em>Kentucky Home Mutual Life Insurance Co. v. Leitner, </em>302 Ky. 789, 196 S.W.2d 421 (1946), Kentucky\u2019s highest court held the opposite. Where a contract contains a provision for amendment, even if that provision allows for unilateral modification by only one party, there is no blanket requirement under Kentucky law that all parties must consent to an amendment before it binds them. <em>See id. </em>at 423 (\u201cIt is stipulated that the insured was bound by the original reinsurance agreement. Since it provided for amendments thereto, he was likewise bound by the amendments, unless the Company was estopped or unless a consideration separate and distinct from the original consideration is required to support the amendment.\u201d). KNC\u2019s assent to the amendment provision in the Original Agreement thus precludes it from challenging the validity of subsequent amendments enacted pursuant to that provision, absent certain exceptions not present in this case. <em>See id. </em>(requiring the objecting party to \u201caccept the contract as it was made\u201d).<footnotemark>2</footnotemark> Because Kentucky law does not prohibit the other thirty-nine Owners of Fractional Interests in the Syndicate from ratifying Lane\u2019s End\u2019s conduct without KNC\u2019s consent, the district court did not err when it granted Lane\u2019s End\u2019s motion to dismiss for lack of subject-matter jurisdiction.</p>\n<p id=\"b517-10\">III.</p>\n<p id=\"b517-11\">Accordingly, we AFFIRM the judgment of the district court.</p>\n<footnote label=\"1\">\n<p id=\"b516-6\">. We recognize that the <em>Weisbord </em>court reached this conclusion in a case where the syndicate agreement was not amended, which is different from the situation here. We cite this case only to demonstrate that the other Owners of Fractional Interests in the Syndicate were permitted under Kentucky law to ratify Lane\u2019s End\u2019s past conduct without KNC\u2019s consent.</p>\n</footnote>\n<footnote label=\"2\">\n<p id=\"b517-6\">. Because we conclude that the other thirty-nine Owners of Fractional Interests in the Syndicate properly ratified Lane\u2019s End\u2019s conduct, we do not address whether the Owners properly could amend the agreement retroactively.</p>\n</footnote>\n</opinion>\n<opinion data-order=\"7\" data-type=\"opinion\" id=\"x999-3\" type=\"concurring-in-part-and-dissenting-in-part\">\n<author id=\"b517-12\">HELENE N. WHITE, Circuit Judge,</author>\n<p id=\"A4_\">concurring and dissenting.</p>\n<p id=\"b517-13\">The majority opinion concludes that KNC\u2019s claims against Lane\u2019s End are moot because the Amended Agreement \u201cnow expressly prohibits the relief sought by KNC.\u201d Maj. Op. at 487. I respectfully dissent from that determination. I would, however, affirm because I agree with the district court\u2019s dismissal on the merits.</p>\n<p id=\"b517-14\">I.</p>\n<p id=\"b517-15\">KNC brought four claims in its amended complaint: (I) for a declaratory judgment regarding KNC\u2019s alleged rights (a) to inspect the Syndicate\u2019s books and records, (b) to an un-redacted purchase offer, and (c) to information regarding the advancement of Syndicate funds to one Owner, all based on the Original Agreement; (II) for a declaratory judgment regarding KNC\u2019s alleged right to inspect the Syndicate\u2019s books and records under the Kentucky Business Corporations Act, Ky.Rev.Stat. Ann. \u00a7 271b.l6-020; (III) for compensatory and punitive damages for Lane\u2019s End\u2019s alleged violations of its fiduciary duties to KNC, based on Lane\u2019s End\u2019s (a) refusal to provide KNC full access to the books and <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"490\">*490</page-number>records, (b) advancing Syndicate funds to one Owner, and (e) polling and attempting to influence the Owners to \u201cratify\u201d its conduct; and (IV) for an accounting of all Syndicate funds based on Kentucky\u2019s law of agency and the Original Agreement. The district court dismissed the claims, and KNC appealed.</p>\n<p id=\"b518-4\">While KNC\u2019s appeal was pending, thirty-nine of the forty members of the Syndicate voted to amend the Syndicate Agreement and to ratify Lane\u2019s End\u2019s challenged conduct. The Amended Agreement makes its changes effective retroactive to the date of the adoption of the Original Agreement and purports to supersede that Agreement entirely. This court affirmed the dismissal of Count II and remanded the case to the district court to determine whether the Amended Agreement rendered moot KNC\u2019s remaining claims. On remand, the district court found that a live controversy no longer exists between the parties because the Amended Agreement \u201cnow expressly bars the exact relief requested by KNC in its original suit for declaratory relief seeking a right to inspect the books and records of the Syndicate,\u201d and because the Owners \u201cexpressly ratified Lane\u2019s End\u2019s actions in not providing KNC with their identities and contact information.\u201d The district court did not separately address KNC\u2019s claim for damages except that it rejected a <em>new </em>argument that KNC made, post-remand, that Lane\u2019s End had continued to engage in conduct contrary to its fiduciary duties when it wrote the Owners and asked them to approve the Amended Agreement. The district court found that argument barred by specific language in the Amended Agreement providing that the Syndicate Manager can express its views to Owners regarding matters in issue.</p>\n<p id=\"b518-7\">In this appeal, KNC appeals only the district court\u2019s determination that Count III, its claim for damages, is moot.<footnotemark>3</footnotemark> It argues that the district court should have granted its request for discovery into the validity of the process used to amend the Original Agreement, and that the other Owners of the Syndicate could not amend the Original Agreement without KNC\u2019s consent, and could not \u201ceffectively and after-the-fact ratify\u201d Lane\u2019s End\u2019s breach of the Original Agreement on KNC\u2019s behalf. I agree with the majority that the district court had the discretion to deny further discovery, but I do not agree that the Amended Agreement renders KNC\u2019s damages claim moot.</p>\n<p id=\"b518-8\">II.</p>\n<p id=\"b518-9\">As KNC apparently concedes, its claims for declaratory and injunctive relief under the Original Agreement are now moot because the Original Agreement no longer exists to enforce. <em>See </em>KNC Br. 6 n. 2 (stating it does not appeal the dismissal of those claims). But the Owners\u2019 adoption of the Amended Agreement does not necessarily moot KNC\u2019s claims for <em>damages </em>because this court can still redress a past violation of the Original Agreement by awarding damages. <em>See Wedgewood Ltd. </em><page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"491\">*491</page-number><em>P\u2019ship I v. Twp. of Liberty, </em>610 F.3d 340, 348 (6th Cir.2010) (\u201c \u2018The test for mootness is whether the relief sought would, if granted, make a difference to the legal interest of the parties.\u2019 \u201d) (citation omitted); <em>see also </em>13C <em>Fed. Prac. &amp; Pros. Juris. </em>\u00a7 3533.3 (3d ed.) (\u201cUntold numbers of cases illustrate the rule that a claim for money damages is not moot, no matter how clear it is that the claim arises from events that have completely concluded without any prospect of recurrence.\u201d).</p>\n<p id=\"b519-5\">Lane\u2019s End asserts, essentially, two reasons that the Amendment Agreement nonetheless renders KNC\u2019s damages claims moot: (1) in the Amended Agreement, the Owners ratified, i.e. retroactively sanctioned, all the conduct of Lane\u2019s End that KNC claims was in violation of the Agreement and Lane\u2019s End\u2019s fiduciary duties; and (2) the Amended Agreement purports to supersede the Original Agreement entirely, as though it never existed.</p>\n<p id=\"b519-6\">A. <em>Ratification</em></p>\n<p id=\"b519-7\">The Original Agreement provides that \u201cthe relationship of the Owners to the Syndicate Manager [is] that of principal and agent.\u201d Under Kentucky law, a principal may ratify or affirm its agent\u2019s otherwise unauthorized conduct. <em>See Stewart v. Mitchell\u2019s Adm\u2019x, </em>301 Ky. 123, 126, 190 S.W.2d 660 (1945) (\u201cAs applied to the law of agency, ratification is the affirmance of an act by one for or in behalf of another at a time when he had no authority to do the act for the one in whose name it was done.\u201d). \u201cAn otherwise-effective ratification eliminates claims that the principal has against the agent, including claims for breach of fiduciary duty.\u201d Restatement (Third) of Agency \u00a7 4.02(b). Accordingly, if KNC ratified Lane\u2019s End\u2019s conduct, all KNC\u2019s claims against Lane\u2019s End would be extinguished, and therefore moot, even claims for damages.</p>\n<p id=\"b519-8\">The Original Agreement provides that a vote of 34 out of 40 Owners may alter, amend, or modify the Agreement, and a simple majority of Owners may resolve \u201call questions properly submitted.\u201d The Owners\u2019 express statement in the Amended Agreement that they ratified Lane\u2019s End\u2019s conduct is undoubtedly effective to ratify the conduct on behalf of the Owners who participated in the vote to amend, but the question is whether it is effective with respect to KNC.</p>\n<p id=\"b519-9\">The majority opinion concludes that Kentucky law permits a simple majority of syndicate owners to ratify an agent\u2019s conduct on behalf of the remaining owners. Maj. Op. at 488 (\u201cKentucky law permits such ratification, even with the consent of a simple majority of the owners.\u201d) (citing <em>Weisbord/Etkin/Goldberg v. Gainesway Mgmt. Corp., </em>No.2007-CA-000280-MR, 2008 WL 820950, at *5-6 (Ky.Ct.App. Mar. 28, 2008), for its observation that \u201c[t]he appellants provide no convincing authority in law or in the express language of the Agreement to support the view that such a post facto approval of the transfer of one share must be approved by all the members of the syndicate.\u201d). But the quoted sentence in <em>Weisbord </em>was not a holding; it was dicta. In <em>Weisbord, </em>the plaintiffs challenged the sale of one member\u2019s Fractional Interest, arguing that in coordinating the sale, the Syndicate Manager had deviated from the terms of the Syndicate Agreement governing such sales. <em>Id. </em>at *2. The court affirmed the dismissal of the plaintiffs\u2019 claims for declaratory and injunctive relief. It found, first, that the plaintiffs were estopped from challenging the sale because they themselves had sought a waiver from the terms of the Agreement. <em>Id. </em>at *4. Second, it addressed the plaintiffs\u2019 argument \u201cthat the ratification was invalid because it was not approved by all the members of the syndi<page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"492\">*492</page-number>cate, but was approved only by a majority.\u201d <em>Id. </em>at *6. The court made the observation quoted above that the plaintiffs had provided \u201cno convincing authority in law or in the express language of the Agreement to support the view that such a post facto approval of the transfer of one share must be approved by all the members of the syndicate.\u201d <em>Id. </em>And then in a footnote immediately following that observation, the court stated: <em>\u201cRegardless of whether the appellants have a valid argument in this regard, </em>they are without remedy due to estoppel as we have explained above.\u201d <em>Id. </em>at *6 n. 8 (emphasis added). Thus, the observation the majority relies on would not bind subsequent Kentucky courts because it is dicta, <em>see Bd. of Claims of Kentucky v. Banks, </em>31 S.W.Bd 436, 439 n. 3 (Ky.Ct.App.2000), and because it appears in an unpublished decision, <em>see </em>Ky. St. RCP 76.28(4)(c). For a federal court sitting in diversity, like this one, the observation is a relevant data point, but is not controlling on its own. <em>See Garden City Osteopathic Hosp. v. HBE Corp., </em>55 F.3d 1126, 1130 (6th Cir.1995) (\u201cWhen deciding a diversity case under state law,\u201d where the state\u2019s highest court has not decided the question, \u201ca federal court must ... ascertain the state law from \u2018all relevant data\u2019 \u201d including \u201cthe state\u2019s appellate court decisions, ... the state\u2019s supreme court dicta, restatements of law, law review commentaries, and the majority rule among other states\u201d) (citations omitted).</p>\n<p id=\"b520-4\">The Kentucky Supreme Court has applied the Restatement (Third) of Agency (2006) to questions of agency law, <em>see Pannell v. Shannon, </em>425 S.W.3d 58, 84 (Ky. 2014) (citing \u00a7\u00a7 4.01, 4.02 in a discussion of ratification), as well as American Jurisprudence, Second Edition, on Agency, <em>see Kindred Nursing Centers Ltd. P\u2019ship v. Leffew, </em>398 S.W.3d 463, 467 (Ky.Ct.App. 2013) (stating that \u201cKentucky has adopted th[e] understanding of ratification\u201d expressed in 2 Am.Jur.2d <em>Agency </em>\u00a7 209 (2013)) (citing <em>Capurso v. Johnson, </em>248 S.W.2d 908, 910 (Ky.1952)). Under the Restatement, the Owners are \u201ccoprincipals,\u201d and lack the power to ratify their agent\u2019s conduct on each other\u2019s behalf. <em>See </em>Restatement (Third) of Agency \u00a7 3.14 (\u201c[A]n agent for coprincipals acts for more than one principal in the same transaction or other matter. Coprincipals are not hierarchically stratified.\u201d); <em>see also id. </em>\u00a7 4.01 (\u201cWhen there are two or more co-principals, <em>each must ratify to be bound.\u201d) </em>(emphasis added). American Jurisprudence is in accord. <em>See </em>3 Am.Jur.2d <em>Agency </em>\u00a7 176 (2013) (\u201cIf a ratification would bind multiple principals, each must affirm with knowledge of the acts to be ratified.\u201d) (citing Restatement (Third) Agency \u00a7 4.06 cmt. b.); <em>see also Kindred Nursing Centers Ltd. P\u2019ship, </em>398 S.W.3d at 467 (citing \u00a7 176 of Am.Jur. as authoritative on a question of agency law).</p>\n<p id=\"b520-6\">KNC did not vote to ratify Lane\u2019s End\u2019s conduct. To resolve the question whether the Owners\u2019 ratification is effective as to KNC, I would look to the authorities the Kentucky Supreme Court and Court of Appeals have relied on in published decisions rather than an unsupported, nonbinding observation in an unpublished decision. According to those authorities, the Owners lacked authority to ratify Lane\u2019s End\u2019s conduct on KNC\u2019s behalf, and therefore, the Owners\u2019 ratification could not and did not extinguish KNC\u2019s claims for damages.</p>\n<p id=\"b520-7\">B. <em>Contract</em></p>\n<p id=\"b520-8\">I would also reject Lane\u2019s End\u2019s contention that the Owners\u2019 purported retroactive amendment of the contract moots KNC\u2019s claims for damages. Lane\u2019s End cites Kentucky decisions holding generally that a contract provision allowing for amendment of the contract is enforceable <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"493\">*493</page-number>and binding, <em>see, e.g., Kentucky Home Mut. Life Ins. Co. v. Leitner, </em>302 Ky. 789, 196 S.W.2d 421, 423 (1946); <em>Supreme Lodge K.P. v. Hunziker, </em>121 Ky. 33, 87 S.W. 1134, 1135 (1905), but neither party cites cases addressing whether a contract provision granting one-sided authority to amend can be reasonably construed to include authority to amend the contract <em>retroactively.</em></p>\n<p id=\"b521-5\">Kentucky follows the general rule of enforcing contracts as written. <em>See Wehr Constructors, Inc. v. Assurance Co. of Am., </em>384 S.W.3d 680, 685 (Ky.2012) (\u201c \u2018[A] written instrument will be enforced strictly according to its terms,\u2019 and a court will interpret the contract\u2019s terms by assigning language its ordinary meaning and without resort to extrinsic evidence.\u201d) (quoting <em>Frear v. P.T.A. Industries, Inc., </em>103 S.W.3d 99,106 (Ky.2003)). No term in the Original Agreement confers on the Owners the power to <em>retroactively </em>change its terms. The Original Agreement provides that it may be \u201caltered, amended, or modified\u201d by thirty-four out of forty Owners, but says nothing about retroactivity, and the contract does not purport to govern the parties\u2019 <em>past </em>conduct. Under those circumstances, I see no basis to conclude that the Owners\u2019 authority to amend the Original Agreement includes the additional extraordinary power to retroactively amend it to eliminate an Owner\u2019s accrued claim for damages. <em>Cf., e.g., Sec. Watch, Inc. v. Sentinel Sys., Inc., </em>176 F.3d 369, 373 (6th Cir.1999) (declining to give a merger clause retroactive effect \u201cas no other provision of the later agreement even \u2018remotely intimate[d] that the parties ever contemplated so radical a retroactive renegotiation of their earlier agreements\u2019 \u201d) (quoting <em>Choice Security Sys., Inc. v. AT &amp; T Corp., </em>No. 97-1774, 1998 WL 153254, at *1 (1st Cir.1998) (unpublished)). To the extent that Lane\u2019s End argues that the Amended Agreement is probative of the Owners\u2019 understanding of the terms of the Original Agreement, that is not a contention that renders KNC\u2019s claims moot; it is an argument on one side of a live controversy.</p>\n<p id=\"b521-7\">I would VACATE the district court\u2019s mootness determination and reach the merits of KNC\u2019s appeal regarding Count III. In this regard, however, I agree with the district court\u2019s dismissal. KNC has shown no breach and no damages as relevant to the claims in this case.</p>\n<footnote label=\"3\">\n<p id=\"b518-5\">. Lane\u2019s End contends that KNC waived appeal of Count III by failing to brief it in its opening brief in the first appeal in this case, and that therefore KNC has waived appeal of all its claims. I disagree. Count III is a claim for punitive and compensatory damages based on the allegedly wrongful conduct described in Count I. In its opening brief in the first appeal, KNC stated \u201d[t]his Appeal relates primarily to the District Court\u2019s dismissal of Count I\u201d and asked this court, if it found reversal warranted on Count I, to remand for the district court for determination of the remaining counts \"based upon the outcome of Count I.\u201d Because KNC made arguments relevant to the reversal of Count III in its opening brief in the first appeal, and asked for reversal of the district court\u2019s decision on that count, I would not find that it waived appeal of the claim.</p>\n</footnote>\n</opinion>\n</casebody>\n",
