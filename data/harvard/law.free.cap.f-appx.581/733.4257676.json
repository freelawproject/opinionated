Williams brought suit against State Farm alleging violations of state law for breach of contract and for bad faith penalties under O.C.G.A. \u00a7 33-4-6. She appeals the district court\u2019s decision granting State Farm Fire and Casualty Company\u2019s (State <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"734\">*734</page-number>Farm) motion for summary judgment. We affirm.</p>\n<p id=\"b762-4\">STANDARD OF REVIEW</p>\n<p id=\"b762-5\">We review \u201ca grant of summary judgment by a district court de novo.\u201d <em>Shuford, v. Fid. Nat\u2019l Prop. &amp; Cas. Ins. Co., </em>508 F.3d 1337, 1341 (11th Cir.2007). In doing so, we \u201cview all facts and reasonable inferences in the light most favorable to [Williams,] the nonmoving party.\u201d <em>Id. </em>But \u201c[s]ummary judgment is warranted where there is no genuine issue of material fact.\u201d <em>Wright v. Aetna Life Ins. Co., </em>110 F.3d 762, 764 (11th Cir.1997) (citing Fed. R.Civ.P. 56(c)).</p>\n<p id=\"b762-6\">BACKGROUND</p>\n<p id=\"b762-7\">On August 7, 2012, Williams\u2019s property in Martinez, Georgia, became flooded with \u201cthigh deep\u201d water runoff from a rainstorm. The storm water on Williams\u2019s property had accumulated at a culvert located up on a hill behind Williams\u2019s and a neighbor\u2019s property. When it rains, storm water is supposed to flow into the culvert and drain away from the residences via a storm drainage system that travels under the street.<footnotemark>1</footnotemark> However, over time, the drainage system had become clogged with debris. Consequently, during the storm on August 7, the storm water overflowed from the culvert and flowed down the hill, onto Williams\u2019s property and then into her home.<footnotemark>2</footnotemark> Water, mud, and other debris entered Williams\u2019s home through the doors and crawlspace underneath her house. The flow of water, mud, and debris continued for about an hour and only began to ebb once a storm drain manhole cover was removed to allow more rainwater into the storm drainage system. The water caused extensive damage to Williams\u2019s house and belongings, and Williams and her family were forced to evacuate the home during repairs.</p>\n<p id=\"b762-11\">As of August 7, 2012, Williams\u2019s home was insured under State Farm\u2019s homeowner\u2019s insurance policy number 81-NU-1664-1 (the Policy). The Policy covers certain accidental direct physical losses to the dwelling itself, but excludes loss \u201cwhich would not have occurred in the absence of ... flood [or] surface water,\u201d regardless of the cause of the flood or surface water and regardless of whether the negligent conduct of a governmental body, or faulty design, construction, or maintenance directly or indirectly caused, contributed to, or aggravated the loss.</p>\n<p id=\"b762-12\">By letter dated August 19, 2012, State Farm denied Williams\u2019s claim under the Policy. Williams later submitted a demand letter on September 20, 2012, notifying State Farm of her intent to seek bad faith penalties and attorney\u2019s fees pursuant to O.C.G.A. \u00a7 33^-6. State Farm reaffirmed its denial in a letter dated November 7, 2012. Williams then filed suit in the Superior Court of Columbia County, raising claims for breach of contract under Georgia law and for bad faith penalties under O.C.G.A. \u00a7 33^-6. State Farm removed the suit to federal court and eventually moved for summary judgment. The district court granted State Farm\u2019s motion on February 21, 2014, concluding that the Policy\u2019s \u201csurface water\u201d exclusion barred <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"735\">*735</page-number>any coverage for damage to Williams\u2019s residence and personal property. This appeal follows.<footnotemark>3</footnotemark></p>\n<p id=\"b763-5\">DISCUSSION</p>\n<p id=\"b763-6\">On appeal, Williams argues that the overflowed water from the storm drain lost its character as \u201csurface water\u201d when it entered her swimming pool, mixed with the water in the pool, and then left the pool and entered her home. Under Georgia law, once this water was concentrated in one area and left that area, it lost its classification of \u201csurface water.\u201d State Farm argues that this swimming-pool theory was never argued before the district court or briefed by the parties, and that therefore we should not consider it on appeal. We agree that this theory of recovery was not considered by the district court and accordingly, we will not consider it on appeal. <em>See Access Now, Inc. v. Sw. Airlines Co., </em>385 F.3d 1324, 1326-27 (11th Cir.2004). In the district court, Williams argued that the water lost its characterization as \u201csurface water\u201d when it entered a man-made storm water diversion system. That is the theory that was briefed by the parties and what the district court considered when it granted State Farm\u2019s motion for summary judgment.</p>\n<p id=\"b763-7\">We conclude that the Policy\u2019s \u201csurface water\u201d exclusion operates to bar coverage for both damage to Williams\u2019s residence and damage to Williams\u2019s personal property. Contrary to Williams\u2019s argument, Georgia law is clear on the definition of \u201csurface water\u201d:</p>\n<blockquote id=\"b763-11\">[Wjater which is derived from falling rain or melting snow, or which rises to the surface in springs, <em>and is diffused over the surface of the ground, while it remains in such diffused state, </em>and which follows no defined course or channel, which does not gather into or form a natural body of water, and which is lost by evaporation, percolation, or natural drainage.</blockquote>\n<p id=\"b763-12\"><em>Selective Way Ins. Co. v. Litig. Tech. Inc., </em>270 Ga.App. 38, 606 S.E.2d 68, 70-71 (2004) (internal quotation marks omitted). State Farm cites to Hirschfield, which is instructive. There, rainwater \u201cflowed or rose\u201d from a grate-covered, underground storm drain located near the plaintiffs\u2019 home, moved \u201cacross the surface, and ... entered a vent leading into the plaintiffs\u2019 basement.\u201d <em>Hirschfield v. Cont\u2019l Cas. Co., </em>199 Ga.App. 654, 405 S.E.2d 737, 738 (1991). There was also evidence that \u201ca blockage in the underground drain caused rainwater, which had previously entered the drain at an upstream location, to be diverted upward through the grate and eventually across the surface area into the basement.\u201d <em>Id. </em>In affirming summary judgment in favor of the insurer, the Geor<page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"736\">*736</page-number>gia Court of Appeals found that \u201cthe \u2018surface water\u2019 exclusion clearly and explicitly excludes coverage under the present circumstances.\u201d <em>Id. </em>at 789.</p>\n<p id=\"b764-4\">Like <em>Hirschfield, </em>debris and tree roots prevented the rainwater from properly flowing through the drainage system near Williams\u2019s home. Instead of flowing into the culvert and the drainage system, the storm water overflowed from the culvert, moved across the surface of certain properties, and flowed into Williams\u2019s home and crawlspace. Also like <em>Hirschfield, </em>even though the water was intended to drain via a storm system, it still maintained its character as \u201csurface water\u201d at the time the water entered Williams\u2019s home and crawlspace.</p>\n<p id=\"b764-5\">The storm water entered Williams\u2019s home on the surface of the ground. The storm water flowed in a diffused state down a hill from the culvert and across Williams\u2019s and a neighbor\u2019s yard. Williams has failed to show that there is a genuine issue of fact about whether the storm water flowing into her residence was \u201csurface water\u201d as defined under the Policy. The district court is affirmed.<footnotemark>4</footnotemark></p>\n<p id=\"b764-6\">AFFIRMED.</p>\n<footnote label=\"1\">\n<p id=\"b762-8\">. The storm drainage system was maintained by Columbia County, Georgia. A similar storm event occurred in 2006, and the resulting flooding caused damage to Williams\u2019s property and home. State Farm denied coverage for the damage under the operative insurance policy at the time; however, Columbia County compensated Williams for the damage.</p>\n</footnote>\n<footnote label=\"2\">\n<p id=\"b762-14\">. Since the August 7, 2012 rainstorm, Columbia County has made improvements to the storm drainage system and removed nearby trees and their root systems.</p>\n</footnote>\n<footnote label=\"3\">\n<p id=\"b763-8\">. Williams has also filed a motion to certify two questions to the Georgia Supreme Court to help define the meaning of \"surface water.\u201d State Farm opposes this motion.</p>\n<p id=\"b763-9\">Where there is no state precedent directly on point, a federal court considers whether the state court decisions \"provide sufficient and significant guidance\u201d on how the state\u2019s highest court would rule. <em>Jennings ex rel. Edwards v. BIC Corp., </em>181 F.3d 1250, 1254-55 (11th Cir. 1999). Georgia courts have adopted the \"widely accepted definition\u201d of \"surface water\u201d and applied that definition to insurance policies, without finding the term to be ambiguous. <em>Selective Way Ins. Co. v. Litig. Tech. Inc., </em>270 Ga.App. 38, 606 S.E.2d 68, 70-71 (2004) (internal quotation marks omitted); <em>see Hirschfield v. Cont\u2019l Cos. Co., </em>199 Ga.App. 654, 405 S.E.2d 737, 738 (1991); <em>Aetna Ins. Co. v. Walker, </em>98 Ga.App. 456, 105 S.E.2d 917, 920 (1958). As is reflected herein, Georgia law provides ample guidance on the issue, and Williams\u2019s motion is DENIED.</p>\n</footnote>\n<footnote label=\"4\">\n<p id=\"b764-8\">. Because we affirm the district court\u2019s finding that Williams failed to demonstrate that her claim was covered by the Policy, Williams's argument that State Farm refused to honor her claim under the Policy is moot.</p>\n</footnote>\n</opinion>\n</casebody>\n",
