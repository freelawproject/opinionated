CABRANES, Circuit Judges.</p>\n<opinion data-order=\"7\" data-type=\"opinion\" id=\"x999-1\" type=\"majority\">\n<p id=\"b127-17\">SUMMARY ORDER</p>\n<p id=\"b127-18\">Plaintiff Junior Richards appeals the judgment of the District Court in favor of defendants, North Shore-Long Island Jewish Health System and Nicholas F. Camerano. Following a three-day trial, a jury found that there was no merit to Richards\u2019 claim of racial discrimination under 42 U.S.C. \u00a7 1981. On appeal, Richards contends that the District Court erred with regard to various evidentiary and procedural rulings. We assume the parties\u2019 familiarity with the facts and procedural history of the case, as well as the issues on appeal.</p>\n<p id=\"b127-19\">DISCUSSION</p>\n<p id=\"b127-20\">We review an evidentiary ruling for clear abuse of discretion, requiring \u201cmanifest error\u201d before we will disturb them. <em>Barrett v. Orange Cnty. Human Rights Comm\u2019n, </em>194 F.3d 341, 346 (2d Cir.1999). An evidentiary ruling that is an abuse of discretion constitutes reversible error only if it also affects a party\u2019s substantial rights. <em>See </em>Fed.R.Evid. 103(a). \u201cUnder Rule 403, so long as the district court has conscientiously balanced the proffered evidence\u2019s probative value with the risk for prejudice, its conclusion will be disturbed only if it is arbitrary or irrational.\u201d <em>United States v. Awadallah, </em>436 F.3d 125, 131 (2d Cir.2006). Finally, a court is \u201cnot required to allow the trial to be diverted into <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"100\">*100</page-number>an inquiry into an entirely different incident involving to a significant extent different people, places and events.\u201d <em>Barrett, </em>194 F.3d at 347.</p>\n<p id=\"b128-4\">Richards challenges the district court\u2019s exclusion of testimony from Koffi Louis. Richards asserts that Mr. Louis\u2019 testimony was necessary to show discrimination of a \u201csimilarly-situated employee.\u201d The plaintiff also contends that the District Court erroneously applied a <em>\u201cper se\u201d </em>rule with regard to his preclusion of Mr. Louis\u2019 testimony.</p>\n<p id=\"b128-5\">We conclude that the district court\u2019s evidentiary ruling in the instant case was not an abuse of discretion. The District Court carefully weighed the relevance of the additional testimony and determined that it was \u201cmarginally relevant.\u201d The Court then noted the witness\u2019 subjective belief that \u201che was not discriminated against\u201d and the fact that the witness \u201cnow has a better job\u201d to conclude that \u201cunder 403 the waste of time and confusion that this witness will lead to far outweighs the probative value[.]\u201d Jt. App\u2019x 841. The balancing inquiry conducted by the District Court is precisely what Fed. R. Ev. 403 envisioned and was certainly not an abuse of discretion.</p>\n<p id=\"b128-6\">CONCLUSION</p>\n<p id=\"b128-7\">Richards also claims that defendants engaged in discovery misconduct, that he was denied the right to a fair trial, and that he should be afforded an additional opportunity to file post-trial motions. We have considered all of plaintiffs arguments and find them to be without merit. Appellant\u2019s final argument related to defendants\u2019 March 8, 2013 motion for attorneys\u2019 fees and costs is moot because the district court stayed its order and the defendants no longer seek enforcement. Accordingly, the appeal from the June 26, 2013 judgment of the District Court is AFFIRMED.</p>\n</opinion>\n</casebody>\n",
