On appeal, he argues that the district court improperly admitted evidence that he created false verifications of employment (\u201cVOE\u201d) and evidence from an undercover Internal Revenue Service (\u201cIRS\u201d) investigation. Al-Suqi further asserts that the prosecutor\u2019s reference to the VOEs during closing argument was plainly improper. Finally, he contends that the district court erroneously relied on evidence not proved at trial in assessing the tax loss attributable to him for sentencing purposes. Finding no error in the district court\u2019s rulings, we affirm.</p>\n<p id=\"b242-10\">First, Al-Suqi contends that the VOE evidence was irrelevant and unnecessary. We review a district court\u2019s evidentiary rulings for abuse of discretion. <em>See United States v. Benkahla, </em>530 F.3d 300, 309 (4th Cir.2008). A district court abuses its discretion by acting \u201carbitrarily or irrationally\u201d in admitting evidence. <em>Id. </em>(internal quotation marks omitted).</p>\n<p id=\"b242-12\">\u201cEvidence of a crime, wrong, or other act is not admissible to prove a person\u2019s character in order to show that on a particular occasion the person acted in accordance with the character.\u201d Fed.R.Evid. 404(b)(1). Such evidence may, however, \u201cbe admissible for another purpose, such as proving motive, opportunity, intent, preparation, plan, knowledge, identity, absence of mistake, or lack of accident.\u201d Fed.R.Evid. 404(b)(2). To be admissible under Rule 404(b), evidence must be \u201c(1) relevant to an issue other than character; (2) necessary; and (3) reliable,\u201d and must also satisfy Fed.R.Evid. 403. <em>United States v. Siegel, </em>536 F.3d 306, 317, 319 (4th Cir.2008) (internal quotation marks omitted). Under Rule 403, \u201cdamage to a defendant\u2019s case is not a basis for excluding probative evidence\u201d because \u201c[ejvidence that is highly probative invariably will be prejudicial to the defense.\u201d <em>United States v. Grimmond, </em>137 F.3d 823, 833 (4th Cir. 1998).</p>\n<p id=\"b242-13\">We conclude that the district court did not abuse its discretion when it admitted the VOE evidence. Evidence that AlSuqi had prepared similar false documents for relatively meager compensation was highly probative on the issue whether he acted knowingly and without mistake in preparing the false returns charged in the indictment, the central issue at trial. Thus, the VOEs were highly relevant and significantly aided the Government in meeting its burden to show that Al-Suqi acted willfully.</p>\n<p id=\"b242-14\">Next, Al-Suqi challenges the district court\u2019s decision to admit evidence recorded during an IRS undercover operation. An IRS agent, posing as a taxpayer, entered Al-Suqi\u2019s tax preparation business <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"215\">*215</page-number>seeking to have a tax return prepared during the time period when Al-Suqi allegedly prepared and submitted false tax returns. The district court concluded that the recording and transcript of the meeting were intrinsic to the charged offenses and admissible under Rule 403.</p>\n<p id=\"b243-5\">\u201cEvidence of uncharged conduct is not other crimes evidence subject to Rule 404 if the uncharged conduct arose out of the same series of transactions as the charged offense, or ... is necessary to complete the story of the crime on trial.\u201d <em>United States v. Basham, </em>561 F.3d 302, 326 (4th Cir.2009) (internal quotation marks omitted). Such intrinsic evidence is \u201cinextricably intertwined\u201d with evidence of the charged offenses and forms an integral part of the testimony concerning them. <em>United States v. Lighty, </em>616 F.3d 321, 352 (4th Cir.2010) (internal quotation marks omitted).</p>\n<p id=\"b243-6\">We conclude that the district court did not abuse its discretion in admitting the challenged evidence, because the evidence was intrinsic to the charges in the indictment. The recording showed Al-Suqi preparing the undercover agent\u2019s tax return in the same fraudulent manner that he prepared the tax returns underlying the charges. The meeting occurred during the same time period that Al-Suqi was preparing the tax returns that were the subject of the indictment. While Al-Suqi\u2019s case was damaged by the incriminating recording and transcript, we cannot say that he was unfairly prejudiced. <em>See Grimmond, </em>137 F.3d at 833.</p>\n<p id=\"b243-7\">Al-Suqi next contends that the prosecutor improperly stated during closing argument that Al-Suqi deceived banks by confirming the false information contained in the VOEs. Because Al-Suqi did not object to this statement at trial, we review for plain error. <em>United States v. Umana, </em>750 F.3d 320, 351 (4th Cir.2014).</p>\n<p id=\"b243-8\">A defendant\u2019s due process rights are violated by a prosecutor\u2019s closing argument when (1) the prosecutor\u2019s remarks were improper, and (2) the improper remarks prejudiced the defendant\u2019s substantial rights to such a degree that he was denied a fair trial. <em>Lighty, </em>616 F.3d at 359. We conclude that Al-Suqi has not demonstrated that the prosecutor\u2019s isolated remark, which was supported by evidence adduced at trial, was either improper or unfairly prejudicial.</p>\n<p id=\"b243-9\">Finally, Al-Suqi argues that the district court erroneously calculated the tax loss attributable to him. He asserts that under <em>Alleyne v. United States, </em>\u2014 U.S.-, 133 S.Ct. 2151, 186 L.Ed.2d 314 (2013), the tax loss amount is an element of the crime that must be submitted to the jury. We disagree. <em>Alleyne </em>requires that any fact, other than a prior conviction, that increases the statutory minimum punishment is an element of the offense that must be proved beyond a reasonable doubt. 133 S.Ct. at 2155, 2162-63. The Supreme Court cautioned that its holding \u201cdoes not mean that any fact that influences judicial discretion must be found by a jury.\u201d <em>Id. </em>at 2163. The tax loss calculation here was relevant only to determine Al-Suqi\u2019s advisory Guidelines range and had no impact on any mandatory minimum sentence. We therefore reject Al-Suqi\u2019s challenge to the tax loss calculation.</p>\n<p id=\"b243-12\">Accordingly, we affirm the district court\u2019s judgment. We dispense with oral argument because the facts and legal contentions are adequately presented in the material before this Court and argument will not aid the decisional process.</p>\n<p id=\"b243-13\">\n<em>AFFIRMED.</em>\n</p>\n</opinion>\n</casebody>\n",
