LOHIER, JR., Circuit Judges.</p>\n<opinion data-order=\"7\" data-type=\"opinion\" id=\"x999-1\" type=\"majority\">\n<p id=\"b119-6\">SUMMARY ORDER</p>\n<p id=\"b119-7\">Defendant Raheem Chatman appeals from the District Court\u2019s March 4, 2013 judgment convicting him, after a hearing, of three violations of the conditions of his supervised release, in violation of 18 U.S.C. \u00a7 3583(e)(3), and sentencing him to 24 months\u2019 imprisonment. We assume the parties\u2019 familiarity with the underlying facts, the procedural history of the case, and the issues on appeal.</p>\n<p id=\"b119-8\">I. Sufficiency of the Evidence</p>\n<p id=\"b119-9\">We review a district court\u2019s finding that a defendant has violated conditions of supervised release for abuse of discretion, and its factual findings for clear error. <em>United States v. Glenn, </em>744 F.3d 845, 847 (2d Cir.2014). A district court may revoke a term of supervised release if it \u201cfinds by a preponderance of the evidence that the defendant violated a condition of supervised release.\u201d 18 U.S.C. \u00a7 3583(e)(3).</p>\n<p id=\"b119-10\">Upon review of the record and relevant law, we conclude that the District Court was well within its discretion in finding that Chatman committed two violations of the condition that he \u201cnot commit another federal, state or local crime.\u201d<footnotemark>1</footnotemark> The District Court properly found that Chatman committed criminal contempt in the second degree, in violation of New York Penal Law \u00a7 215.50(3), when he violated a temporary order of protection prohibiting him from having unauthorized contact with Iziah Delva, the son of his former girlfriend, Kimberly McIntosh. The record contains unrebutted testimony from Delva\u2019s aunt showing that Chatman aggressively approached a car in which Delva was a passenger by speeding toward it-on the wrong side of the road and stopping inches from the driver-side door. Earlier that day, Chatman had observed the same car picking Delva up after a supervised visit.</p>\n<p id=\"b119-13\">The District Court also properly found that Chatman committed assault in the third degree, in violation of New York Penal Law \u00a7 120.00. The record contains ample evidence showing that, hours after the incident described above, Chatman slapped McIntosh in the face and hit her with a hard plastic bottle, causing swelling and bruising to her face. On this record, we cannot conclude that the District Court abused its discretion or committed clear error.</p>\n<p id=\"b119-14\">II. Reasonableness of the Sentence</p>\n<p id=\"b119-15\">We review criminal sentences for \u201creasonableness\u201d under a deferential abuse-of-discretion standard. <em>United States v. Cavera, </em>550 F.3d 180, 188 (2d Cir.2008) (en banc). A sentence is substantively unreasonable \u201conly in exceptional cases where the trial court\u2019s decision cannot be located within the range of permissible decisions.\u201d <em>Id. </em>(internal quotation marks omitted). <em>See generally United States v. Park, </em>758 F.3d 193, 199-201 (2d Cir.2014).</p>\n<p id=\"b119-16\">Upon review of the record and relevant law, we conclude that the District Court\u2019s above-guidelines sentence of 24 months\u2019 imprisonment, which was the statutory maximum, was substantively reasonable. Considering the totality of the circumstances, including the District Court\u2019s emphasis on Chatman\u2019s repeated, violent behavior and numerous violations of supervised release, we cannot conclude that the District Court\u2019s sentence was outside \u201cthe range of permissible decisions\u201d or <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"92\">*92</page-number>otherwise an abuse of discretion. <em>Park, </em>758 F.3d at 200; <em>Cavera, </em>550 F.3d at 189.</p>\n<p id=\"b120-4\">CONCLUSION</p>\n<p id=\"b120-5\">We have considered all of the arguments raised by defendant on appeal and find them to be without merit. For the reasons stated above, we AFFIRM the District Court\u2019s March 4, 2013 judgment.</p>\n<footnote label=\"1\">\n<p id=\"b119-11\">. Chatman does not challenge his third violation of the conditions of his supervised release \u2014 his failure to complete 60 hours of community service. <em>See </em>Appellant\u2019s Br. 1.</p>\n</footnote>\n</opinion>\n</casebody>\n",
