For the reasons that follow, we will affirm the District Court\u2019s May 5, 2014 order.</p>\n<p id=\"b181-24\">I.</p>\n<p id=\"b181-25\">In 2006, the District Court sentenced Reyes to 396 months in prison following his conviction for possessing 500 grams or more of cocaine with the intent to distribute. In March 2014, he filed a pro se motion with the District Court, seeking to correct a \u201csimple clerical error\u201d in the court\u2019s J &amp; C Order pursuant to Rule 36.<footnotemark>1</footnotemark> In the section of the J <em>&amp; </em>C Order that identifies his offense and the pertinent statutory provisions, one of the statutes listed is 21 U.S.C. \u00a7 841(b)(1)(B). In his motion, Reyes claimed that this statute <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"154\">*154</page-number>\u201cmust be followed with an (ii)\u201d (referring to \u00a7 841(b)(l)(B)(ii)). In making this claim, he indicated that he was not seeking to disturb his sentence or his underlying conviction.</p>\n<p id=\"b182-4\">On May 5, 2014, the District Court denied Reyes\u2019s Rule 86 motion, concluding that no clerical error had been made because the J &amp; C Order \u201caccurately reflects the statutory provisions underlying [his] conviction and sentence.\u201d This appeal followed.<footnotemark>2</footnotemark></p>\n<p id=\"b182-5\">II.</p>\n<p id=\"b182-6\">Section 841(b)(1)(B) sets forth the mandatory minimum and maximum sentences for certain drug offenses. The drugs and drug amounts that are covered by this statute are listed in subsections (i) through (viii). Following those subsections is an unnumbered paragraph that identifies the length of the applicable mandatory minimum and maximum sentences. Here, Reyes\u2019s argument appears to rest on his belief that subsection (ii), which provides that an offense involving 500 grams or more of cocaine is covered by this statute, is the only part of the statute that governed his criminal case. He is mistaken, however, because the unnumbered paragraph setting forth the applicable mandatory minimum and maximum sentences governed, too. Accordingly, we agree with the District Court that \u00a7 841(b)(1)(B) was correctly listed on the J &amp; C Order.</p>\n<p id=\"b182-7\">Because this appeal does not present a substantial question, we will summarily affirm the District Court\u2019s May 5, 2014 order. <em>See </em>3d Cir. I.O.P. 10.6.<footnotemark>3</footnotemark></p>\n<footnote label=\"1\">\n<p id=\"b181-26\">. Rule 36 provides that, \"[a]fter giving any notice it considers appropriate, the court may at any time correct a clerical error in a judgment, order, or other part of the record, or correct an error in the record arising from oversight or omission.\u201d Fed.R.Crim.P. 36.</p>\n</footnote>\n<footnote label=\"2\">\n<p id=\"b182-8\">. We have jurisdiction over this appeal pursuant to 28 U.S.C. \u00a7 1291.</p>\n</footnote>\n<footnote label=\"3\">\n<p id=\"b182-25\">. Although we have yet to articulate the standard for reviewing a district court\u2019s denial of a Rule 36 motion, we need not do so here <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"155\">*155</page-number>because this appeal fails under any available standard.</p>\n</footnote>\n</opinion>\n</casebody>\n",
