WESLEY, Circuit Judges.</p>\n<opinion data-order=\"7\" data-type=\"opinion\" id=\"x999-1\" type=\"majority\">\n<p id=\"b86-12\">SUMMARY ORDER</p>\n<p id=\"b86-13\">Jeffrey Navin (\u201cNavin\u201d) appeals from a decision of the United States District Court for the District of Connecticut dismissing his complaint for failure to state a claim pursuant to Federal Rule of Civil Procedure 12(b)(6), as well as an order denying Navin\u2019s motion for reconsideration.<footnotemark>1</footnotemark> We assume the parties\u2019 familiarity with the underlying facts, procedural history, and issues on appeal.</p>\n<p id=\"b86-17\">The majority of Navin\u2019s claims are barred by the <em>Rooker-Feldman </em>doctrine because they were already litigated and decided by Connecticut state courts. <em>McKithen v. Brown, </em>626 F.3d 143, 154 (2d Cir.2010). To the extent that Navin raises claims under the Connecticut Unfair Trade Practices Act (\u201cCUTPA\u201d), Conn. Gen.Stat. \u00a7\u00a7 42-110a <em>et seq., </em>that are not barred by <em>Rooker-Feldman, </em>those claims are time-barred as not having occurred within the three-year statute of limitations. We have considered all of Navin\u2019s remaining arguments and find them to be without merit, and we affirm the dismissal of Navin\u2019s complaint for substantially the reasons stated in Judge Underhill\u2019s well-reasoned decision.<footnotemark>2</footnotemark></p>\n<p id=\"b86-18\">For the reasons stated above, the judgment of the district court is AFFIRMED.</p>\n<footnote label=\"1\">\n<p id=\"b86-14\">. The standards of review are not in dispute. We review de novo a district court's grant of a Rule 12(b)(6) motion to dismiss, accepting the complaint\u2019s factual allegations as true and drawing all reasonable inferences in the plaintiff\u2019s favor. <em>See Krys v. Pigott, </em>749 F.3d 117, 128 (2d Cir.2014). \"To survive a motion to dismiss, a complaint must contain sufficient factual matter, accepted as true, to state a claim to relief that is plausible on its face.\u201d <em>Ashcroft v. Iqbal, </em>556 U.S. 662, 678, 129 S.Ct. 1937, 173 L.Ed.2d 868 (2009) (internal quotation marks omitted). We review the denial of a motion for reconsideration for abuse of discretion. <em>See Analytical Surveys, Inc. v. Tonga Partners, L.P., </em>684 F.3d 36, 52 (2d Cir.2012).</p>\n</footnote>\n<footnote label=\"2\">\n<p id=\"b86-21\">. Defendants-Appellees\u2019 motion to dismiss the appeal for Navin's failure to file a principal brief that complies with Federal Rule of Appellate Procedure 28(a) and/or Local Rule 28.1 is DENIED as moot.</p>\n</footnote>\n</opinion>\n</casebody>\n",
