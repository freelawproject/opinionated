We assume the parties\u2019 familiarity with the underlying facts, the procedural history, and the issues presented for review.</p>\n<p id=\"b94-6\">D.S. brings a procedural due process claim under 42 U.S.C. \u00a7 1988, alleging that defendants disclosed his sealed criminal records in violation of New York Criminal Procedure Law \u00a7 160.50. D.S. argues that Section 160.50 creates a liberty interest in the confidentiality of sealed criminal records, and that defendants\u2019 (undisputed) violation of Section 160.50 deprived him of liberty without due process of law.</p>\n<p id=\"b94-7\">Defendants argue, and the district court held, that Section 160.50 does not create a liberty interest that gives rise to a federal constitutional claim. Defendants also argue that D.S. fails to state a claim for two simpler reasons: (1) he has not plausibly alleged any intentional deprivation of his constitutional rights, and (2) he has not alleged a basis for municipal liability. We affirm on the ground that D.S. has not plausibly pleaded that his injury was inflicted intentionally.</p>\n<p id=\"b94-8\">We review <em>de novo </em>a district court\u2019s grant of a motion to dismiss for failure to state a claim, accepting all factual allegations as true and drawing all reasonable inferences in favor of the plaintiff. <em>Lotes Co., Ltd. v. Hon Hai Precision Indus. Co., </em>753 F.3d 395, 403 (2d Cir.2014). \u201cTo survive a motion to dismiss, a complaint must contain sufficient factual matter, accepted as true, to \u2018state a claim for relief that is plausible on its face.\u2019\u201d <em>Ashcroft v. Iqbal, </em>556 U.S. 662, 678, 129 S.Ct. 1937, 173 L.Ed.2d 868 (2009) (quoting <em>Bell Atl. Corp. v. Twombly, </em>550 U.S. 544, 570, 127 S.Ct. 1955, 167 L.Ed.2d 929 (2007)).</p>\n<p id=\"b94-10\">\u201c[T]he Due Process Clause is simply not implicated by a negligent act of an official causing unintended loss of or injury to life, liberty, or property.\u201d <em>Daniels v. Williams, </em>474 U.S. 327, 328, 106 S.Ct. 662, 88 L.Ed.2d 662 (1986) (emphasis omitted); <em>see also Shannon v. Jacobowitz, </em>394 F.3d 90, 94 (2d Cir.2005) (\u201c[I]n <em>Daniels </em>[, the U.S. Supreme Court] clearly articulated that a finding of intentional conduct was a prerequisite for a due process claim.\u201d). So to survive a motion to dismiss, D.S. must plausibly allege that defendants violated his constitutional rights <em>intentionally </em>\u2014 not just negligently.</p>\n<p id=\"b94-11\">He has not done so. The only allegations in the complaint are either insufficient to demonstrate intent (even if accepted as true), or are conclusory allegations not entitled to the presumption of truth.</p>\n<p id=\"b94-12\">For example, D.S. alleges that, \u201c[u]pon information and belief,\u201d the Peekskill chief of police \u201cpersonally and/or by and through his attorney James A. Mitchell, ... authorized, approved, and/or acquiesced in the disclosure of D.S.\u2019s sealed police file.\u201d Compl. \u00b6 26. But a government official approving the disclosure of a sealed file \u2014 presumably relying on his attorney to handle the document production \u2014 is not the same thing as a government official approving the disclosure of a file he knows to be sealed. D.S.\u2019s allegation might support an inference of negligence; it does not plausibly allege intent.</p>\n<p id=\"b94-13\">D.S. also alleges that \u201c[t]he government defendants acted with intentional, knowing, callous, and/or reckless indifference to the plaintiff\u2019s constitutional rights,\u201d Compl. <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"67\">*67</page-number>\u00b6 51, and that \u201c[a]t all relevant times, one or more county officials with final policy-making authority had knowledge of and authorized, approved, and/or acquiesced in the unconstitutional conduct alleged in this case,\u201d Compl. \u00b6 5. But conclusory allegations like these are not entitled to the presumption of truth. <em>Iqbal, </em>556 U.S. at 681, 129 S.Ct. 1937.</p>\n<p id=\"b95-5\">The pleading does not plausibly allege that defendants would know that their document production in the <em>Deskovic </em>litigation included twenty-year-old files sealed pursuant to Section 160.50. And, critically, D.S. makes no allegation to the contrary; that is, D.S. does not allege that any government official was aware (or should have been aware) that their document production included sealed files. Similarly, he does not allege that any government official intended to disclose sealed files.</p>\n<p id=\"b95-6\">D.S. quotes <em>Hudson v. New York City, </em>271 F.3d 62, 68 (2d Cir.2001), for the proposition that \u201cSection 1983 does not require any intent to violate constitutional rights.\u201d True enough. But, although <em>Section 1983 </em>has no intent requirement, a Section 1983 plaintiff must still allege an underlying constitutional violation. And some constitutional violations \u2014 like a violation of the Due Process <em>Clause </em>\u2014 do require intent. <em>See, e.g., Gold v. Feinberg, </em>101 F.3d 796, 800 (2d Cir.1996) (\u201c[M]ore than negligent conduct by the state actor is needed in order for a cognizable \u00a7 1983 claim to exist based on violations of the due process clause.\u201d); <em>see also Hudson, 271 </em>F.3d at 68 (\u201c\u00a7 1983 plaintiffs need only demonstrate intent where the underlying constitutional deprivation ... calls for it.\u201d).</p>\n<p id=\"b95-7\">In the end, D.S. has \u201cnot nudged [this] claim [ ] across the line from conceivable to plausible.\u201d <em>Twombly, </em>550 U.S. at 570, 127 S.Ct. 1955. Although the district court did not address the question of intent, \u201c[w]e may, of course, affirm on any basis for which there is a record sufficient to permit conclusions of law, including grounds upon which the district court did not rely.\u201d <em>Cromwell </em>Assocs. <em>v. Oliver Cromwell Owners, Inc., </em>941 F.2d 107, 111 (2d Cir.1991) (citations omitted). We do so here.<footnotemark>1</footnotemark></p>\n<p id=\"b95-11\">For the foregoing reasons, we hereby AFFIRM the judgment of the district court.</p>\n<footnote label=\"1\">\n<p id=\"b95-8\">. We do not decide whether Section 160.50 creates a liberty interest protected by the Due Process Clause, or whether D.S. has alleged a basis for municipal liability.</p>\n</footnote>\n</opinion>\n</casebody>\n",
