The district court rejected Harris\u2019s claim that the presence on his jury of a former schoolteacher with whom he had problems decades before violated his Sixth and Fourteenth Amendment rights to an impartial jury in 2005. We affirm.</p>\n<p id=\"b642-7\">In the absence of a showing of cause and prejudice, a federal habeas court will not review a claim rejected by the state court on the basis of an independent and adequate state procedural rule. <em>Walker v. Martin, </em>\u2014 U.S. -, -, 131 S.Ct. 1120, 1127, 179 L.Ed.2d 62 (2011). Harris cannot demonstrate prejudice because he cannot show that Juror No. 8 was actually or impliedly biased. <em>See United States v. Gonzalez, </em>214 F.3d 1109, 1111-12 (9th Cir. 2000). Actual bias is \u201cbias in fact \u2014 the existence of a state of mind that leads to an inference that the person will not act with entire impartiality.\u201d <em>Id. </em>at 1112 (internal quotation marks omitted). Implied bias exists in \u201cextreme situations where the relationship between a prospective juror and some aspect of the litigation is such that it is highly unlikely that the average person could remain impartial in his deliberations under the circumstances.\u201d <em>Tinsley v. Borg, </em>895 F.2d 520, 527 (9th Cir.1990) (internal quotation marks omitted).</p>\n<p id=\"b642-11\">The district court did not err in holding that Harris failed to show that Juror No. 8 was actually or impliedly biased. There was no evidence of either. Indeed, Juror No. 8 told Harris\u2019s investigator that although she recalled performing jury duty in 2005, she had no recollection of Harris from the trial or from school.</p>\n<p id=\"b642-12\">AFFIRMED.</p>\n<footnote label=\"**\">\n<p id=\"b642-10\"> This disposition is not appropriate for publication and is not precedent except as provided by 9th Cir.
