This is the latest of Henderson\u2019s legal battles relating to his employment with LTD. He previously accepted money to settle an accusation of racial discrimination and a claim for workers\u2019 compensation. He also lost a lawsuit against LTD and lawyers who represented both him and the company in settling his allegation of discrimination. The district court dismissed this action for a variety of reasons, including failure to state a claim for relief under federal law. We uphold the dismissal.</p>\n<p id=\"b606-10\">For purposes of this appeal, we accept as true the facts alleged in Henderson\u2019s complaint and incorporated exhibits. <em>See Adams v. City of Indianapolis, </em>742 F.3d 720, 728 (7th Cir.2014); <em>Phillips v. Prudential Ins. Co. of Am., </em>714 F.3d 1017, 1019-20 (7th Cir.2013). Henderson began working as a maintenance mechanic for LTD in 2007. His coworkers made racial slurs and assigned him the more-dangerous tasks because he was the only African American on the maintenance team. One such task was repairing a conveyor belt while it still was operating, leading to a knee injury and temporary disability for which he collected workers\u2019 compensation benefits beginning in 2008. Henderson reported the discrimination to LTD\u2019s personnel department and then retained a lawyer. In 2009, the parties executed an $83,000 settlement that ended Henderson\u2019s employment with LTD but stipulated that he would waive all future claims against the company except as relating to his unresolved demand for additional workers\u2019 compensation. The total payment to Henderson included $40,000 for emotional harm and other injuries unrelated to lost wages. LTD recorded this amount on an IRS Form 1099 as \u201cnonemployee compensation.\u201d Henderson wrote to the IRS, asking if it was correct to classify the $40,000 as \u201cnonemployee compensation.\u201d He suspected that, by recording the amount this way, LTD had represented to the IRS that he was a contract worker instead of an employee, thus undermining his claim for workers\u2019 compensation.</p>\n<p id=\"b606-14\">Then in 2011 Henderson filed the first of his lawsuits against LTD, raising a number of federal and state claims but principally seeking to nullify the 2009 settlement. Also named as defendants were the lawyers who represented him and LTD in the settlement negotiations. The district court dismissed all of Henderson\u2019s federal claims sua sponte for failure to state a claim and declined to exercise supplemental jurisdiction over his state-law claims. <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"579\">*579</page-number><em>See Henderson v. Rauen, </em>No. 11-cv-5787 (N.D.Ill. Sept. 28, 2011). Henderson did not appeal the dismissal.</p>\n<p id=\"b607-5\">Meanwhile, attorney Jason Marker negotiated on Henderson\u2019s behalf to resolve the workers\u2019 compensation claim, which remained before the Illinois Workers\u2019 Compensation Commission. Marker and counsel for LTD agreed on $140,000 in addition to the workers\u2019 compensation benefits Henderson already had received, but the company, having just been sued by Henderson, apparently wanted from him a new release of all other, unrelated claims. Marker thus presented Henderson with proposed settlements that would give him $140,000 for his workers\u2019 compensation claim plus a nominal $1 payment for a general release of any other claims against LTD. Henderson balked because he suspected that Marker and LTD were trying to trick him into waiving his workers\u2019 compensation claim as part of the general release, even though that claim was explicitly excluded from the general release. Henderson twice signed and then revoked the general release, which prompted Marker to threaten to withdraw. The appellate record does not disclose what became of the workers\u2019 compensation claim or the general release, but a search of the website of the Illinois Workers\u2019 Compensation Commission confirmed that the parties settled the workers\u2019 compensation claim for $140,000 in December 2011.</p>\n<p id=\"b607-6\">In 2013 the IRS responded to Henderson\u2019s concern that LTD had mischaracterized the $40,000 from the initial settlement as \u201cnonemployee compensation.\u201d The IRS wrote that LTD should have classified the amount as \u201cother income\u201d on the Form 1099. LTD issued a corrected Form 1099, but a lawyer hired by Henderson (whose opinion is attached as an exhibit to one of his submissions) advised that the difference in characterization had no tax significance.</p>\n<p id=\"b607-8\">Henderson then filed this action against LTD and Marker, asserting multiple federal and state-law claims. He accused LTD and Marker of violating 42 U.S.C. \u00a7 1985(3) by conspiring to trick him into releasing his workers\u2019 compensation claim for $1, to deprive him of \u201cstatutorily protected proceedings,\u201d and to interfere with his workers\u2019 compensation rights. He also claimed that, because of his race, the defendants had interfered with his contract rights in violation of 42 U.S.C. \u00a7 1981 by misclassifying his work status with the IRS and by retaliating against him for filing his first lawsuit. Henderson also asserted a series of state-law claims, including negligent supervision against LTD and breach of fiduciary duty against Marker. On the defendants\u2019 motions, the district court dismissed the federal claims based on claim preclusion and failure to state a claim. The court declined to exercise supplemental jurisdiction over the state-law claims.</p>\n<p id=\"b607-9\">On appeal Henderson makes several arguments, but we need not elaborate on them because we conclude that, affirmative defenses aside, his lengthy complaint states no federal claim. Indeed, as the district court noted, many of Henderson\u2019s principal allegations are contradicted by his attachments. A claim arising under either \u00a7 1985(3) or \u00a7 1981 would require proof that LTD and Marker acted <em>because </em>of Henderson\u2019s race. <em>See Domino\u2019s Pizza, Inc. v. McDonald, </em>546 U.S. 470, 476, 126 S.Ct. 1246, 163 L.Ed.2d 1069 (2006) (explaining that \u00a7 1981 offers relief when racial discrimination interferes with contract rights); <em>Bray v. Alexandria Women\u2019s Health Clinic, </em>506 U.S. 263, 267-68, 113 S.Ct. 753, 122 L.Ed.2d 34 (1993) (noting that \u00a7 1985(3) requires proof of racial or other class-based animus); <em>Muhammad v. Oliver, </em>547 F.3d 874, 878 (7th Cir.2008) <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"580\">*580</page-number>(discussing \u00a7 1981); <em>Brokaw v. Mercer Cnty., </em>235 F.3d 1000, 1024 (7th Cir.2000) (discussing \u00a7 1985). In his complaint Henderson accuses LTD and Marker of acting because of his race, but his 30-page complaint and almost 90 pages of attachments come nowhere close to plausibly alleging discriminatory animus by LTD or Marker. Similarly, Henderson claims retaliation under \u00a7 1981, but this conclusory allegation is refuted by attachments showing that he suffered no ill effects from LTD\u2019s actions. <em>See CBOCS West, Inc. v. Humphries, </em>553 U.S. 442, 457, 128 S.Ct. 1951, 170 L.Ed.2d 864 (2008) (holding that \u00a7 1981 encompasses retaliation); <em>Stephens v. Erickson, </em>569 F.3d 779, 786 (7th Cir. 2009) (explaining that adverse action is an element of retaliation claim under \u00a7 1981).</p>\n<p id=\"b608-4\">Simply reciting legal terms will not suffice to state a federal claim, so the district court properly dismissed Henderson\u2019s \u00a7 1985 and \u00a7 1981 claims. <em>See Ashcroft v. Iqbal, </em>556 U.S. 662, 678, 681, 129 S.Ct. 1937, 173 L.Ed.2d 868 (2009); <em>Bell Atl. Corp. v. Twombly, </em>550 U.S. 544, 555-56, 570, 127 S.Ct. 1955, 167 L.Ed.2d 929 (2007); <em>Adams, </em>742 F.3d at 728, 733. And Henderson does not contest the district court\u2019s choice to decline to exercise supplemental jurisdiction over his state-law claims, so those claims are abandoned. <em>See Powers v. Richards, </em>549 F.3d 505, 512-13 (7th Cir.2008); <em>Crestview Vill. Apartments v. U.S. Dep\u2019t of Hous. &amp; Urban Dev., </em>383 F.3d 552, 555 (7th Cir.2004).</p>\n<p id=\"b608-5\">We have reviewed Henderson\u2019s remaining contentions, and none has merit.</p>\n<p id=\"b608-6\">AFFIRMED.</p>\n</opinion>\n</casebody>\n",
