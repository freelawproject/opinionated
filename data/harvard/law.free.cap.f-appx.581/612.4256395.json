We have jurisdiction under 8 U.S.C. \u00a7 1252. We review for abuse of discretion the denial of a motion to reopen. <em>Meza-Vallejos v. Holder, </em>669 F.3d 920, 923-24 (9th Cir.2012). We deny the petition for review.</p>\n<p id=\"b640-16\">The BIA did not abuse its discretion by denying for lack of prejudice Olea-Ramos\u2019s motion to reopen based on his prior attorney\u2019s failure to file an appellate brief challenging the immigration judge\u2019s denial of cancellation of removal. <em>See Serrano v. Gonzales, </em>469 F.3d 1317, 1319 (9th Cir. 2006) (\u201cTo assert a valid due process ineffective assistance of counsel claim, a petitioner must demonstrate prejudice; namely, he must show that he has \u2018plausible grounds for relief.\u2019\u201d (citation omitted)). Because Olea-Ramos is statutorily ineligible for cancellation of removal on account of his prior act of alien smuggling, he is unable to establish plausible grounds for this relief. <em>See Sanchez v. Holder, </em>560 F.3d 1028, 1032 (9th Cir.2009) (en banc) (\u201c[Ajlien smugglers are one of the classes of persons that cannot be found to have good moral character for the purposes of cancellation of removal----\u201d).</p>\n<p id=\"b640-21\">In addition, the BIA did not abuse its discretion by denying Olea-Ramos\u2019s motion to reopen based on his prior attorney\u2019s failure to submit proof of voluntary-departure bond payment, where Olea-Ramos did not provide proof of payment with his motion to reopen. <em>See </em>8 C.F.R. \u00a7 1240.26(c)(3)(ii).</p>\n<p id=\"b640-22\">PETITION FOR REVIEW DENIED.</p>\n<footnote label=\"**\">\n<p id=\"b640-30\"> This disposition is not appropriate for publication and is not precedent except as provided by 9th Cir.
