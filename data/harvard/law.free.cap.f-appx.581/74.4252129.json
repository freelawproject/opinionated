Apr. 30, 2013), <em>aff'g </em>No. A200 923 597 (Immig. Ct. N.Y. City Aug. 23, 2011). We assume the parties\u2019 familiarity with the underlying facts and procedural history of this case.</p>\n<p id=\"b102-20\">Under the circumstances of this case, we have reviewed the IJ\u2019s decision as modified by the BIA. <em>See Xue Hong Yang v. U.S. DOJ, </em>426 F.3d 520, 522 (2d Cir.2005). The <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"75\">*75</page-number>applicable standards of review are well established. <em>See </em>8 U.S.C. \u00a7 1252(b)(4)(B); <em>see Yanqin Weng v. Holder, </em>562 F.3d 510, 513 (2d Cir.2009).</p>\n<p id=\"b103-5\">Pursuant to 8 U.S.C. \u00a7 1158(a)(3), we lack jurisdiction to review the agency\u2019s determination that an asylum application is untimely. <em>See </em>8 U.S.C. \u00a7 1158(a)(2)(B). Although we retain jurisdiction to review \u201cconstitutional claims or questions of law,\u201d 8 U.S.C. \u00a7 1252(a)(2)(D), Xue challenges only the weight accorded certain evidence. Accordingly, he has not raised a colorable question of law or constitutional claim. We therefore dismiss the petition as to asylum.</p>\n<p id=\"b103-6\">We do have jurisdiction to review the agency\u2019s denial of withholding of removal and CAT relief on credibility grounds. For applications, like Xue\u2019s, governed by the REAL ID Act, the agency may, \u201c[c]onsidering the totality of the circumstances,\u201d base a credibility finding on inconsistencies in the applicant\u2019s statements and other record evidence \u201cwithout regard to whether\u201d those inconsistencies go \u201cto the heart of the applicant\u2019s claim.\u201d 8 U.S.C. \u00a7\u00a7 1158(b)(l)(B)(iii), 1231(b)(3)(C); <em>Xiu Xia Lin v. Mukasey, </em>534 F.3d 162, 163-64 (2d Cir.2008) (per curiam). Here, substantial evidence supports the agency\u2019s decision.</p>\n<p id=\"b103-7\">As Xue\u2019s withholding of removal and CAT claims share the same factual predicate, the adverse credibility determination is dispositive of both. <em>See Paul v. Gonzales, </em>444 F.3d 148, 155-57 (2d Cir.2006).</p>\n<p id=\"b103-8\">For the foregoing reasons, the petition for review is DISMISSED in part and DENIED in part. As we have completed our review, any stay of removal that the Court previously granted in this petition is VACATED, and any pending motion for a stay of removal in this petition is DISMISSED as moot. Any pending request for oral argument in this petition is DENIED in accordance with Federal Rule of Appellate Procedure 34(a)(2), and Second Circuit Local Rule 34.1(b).</p>\n</opinion>\n</casebody>\n",
