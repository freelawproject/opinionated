May 2, 2013), <em>aff'g </em>No. A071 638 210 (Immig. Ct. N.Y. City Oct. 6, 2010). We assume the parties\u2019 familiarity with the underlying facts and procedural history of this case.</p>\n<p id=\"b115-6\">Under the circumstances of this case, we have reviewed both the IJ\u2019s and the BIA\u2019s opinions \u201cfor the sake of completeness.\u201d <em>Zaman v. Mukasey, </em>514 F.3d 233, 237 (2d Cir.2008) (quotation marks and citations omitted). The applicable standards of review are well established. <em>See 8 </em>U.S.C. \u00a7 1252(b)(4)(B); <em>see also Jian Hui Shao v. Mukasey, </em>546 F.3d 138, 157-58 (2d Cir. 2008); <em>Secaida-Rosales v. INS, </em>331 F.3d 297, 307 (2d Cir.2003), <em>superseded by statute, </em>REAL ID Act of 2005, Pub.L. No. 109-13, 119 Stat. 231, <em>as recognized in Xiu Xia Lin v. Mukasey, </em>534 F.3d 162, 163-64 (2d Cir.2008).</p>\n<p id=\"b115-7\">L Past Persecution</p>\n<p id=\"b115-8\">In pre-REAL ID Act cases, such as this case, an adverse credibility determination must be based on \u201cspecific, cogent reasons\u201d that \u201cbear a legitimate nexus to the finding,\u201d and any discrepancy must be \u201csubstantial\u201d when measured against the record as a whole. <em>See Secaida-Rosales, </em>331 F.3d at 307 (internal quotation marks and citations omitted). Substantial evidence supports the agency\u2019s determination that Yu was not credible as to his claim that family planning officials had forced his ex-wife to terminate a pregnancy and had fined and detained him on account of that pregnancy.</p>\n<p id=\"b115-10\">Yu omitted from his original asylum application his alleged detention despite a question explicitly asking him to indicate whether he had ever been detained. <em>See Liang Chen v. U.S. Attorney Gen., </em>454 F.3d 103, 106-07 (2d Cir.2006); <em>see also Xiu Xia Lin, </em>534 F.3d at 166 n. 3 (\u201c[a]n inconsistency and an omission are ... functionally equivalent.\u201d). Yu did not provide a compelling explanation for this omission. <em>See Majidi v. Gonzales, </em>430 F.3d 77, 80 (2d Cir.2005). Moreover, as the agency noted, Yu had reason to later embellish his claim to include a detention under China\u2019s coercive population control policy. Prior to Yu\u2019s submission of an amended application, we issued our decision in <em>Shi Liang Lin v. U.S. Department of Justice, </em>494 F.3d 296 (2d Cir.2007), under which he was no longer per se eligible for relief solely based on his spouse\u2019s purported forced procedure.</p>\n<p id=\"b115-11\">Given the material omission from Yu\u2019s application, coupled with the timing of his amended application following the <em>Shi Liang Lin </em>decision, the agency reasonably found him not credible as to his claim of past persecution. <em>See Secaida-Rosales, </em>331 F.3d at 307-08; <em>see also Liang Chen, </em>454 F.3d at 106-07.</p>\n<p id=\"b115-12\">II. Well-Founded Fear of Persecution</p>\n<p id=\"b115-13\">For largely the same reasons as this Court set forth in Jian Hui Shao, 546 F.3d 138, we find no error in the agency\u2019s determination that Yu failed to demonstrate his eligibility for relief based on his fear of future persecution for his alleged violation of China\u2019s population control program. <em>See id. </em>at 158-72.</p>\n<p id=\"b115-14\">For the foregoing reasons, the petition for review is DENIED. As we have completed our review, any stay of removal that the Court previously granted in this peti<page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"88\">*88</page-number>tion is VACATED, and any pending motion for a stay of removal in this petition is DISMISSED as moot. Any pending request for oral argument in this petition is DENIED in accordance with Federal Rule of Appellate Procedure 34(a)(2), and Second Circuit Local Rule 34.1(b).</p>\n</opinion>\n</casebody>\n",
