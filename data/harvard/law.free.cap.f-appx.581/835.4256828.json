Resolution of this case requires no expansion of the law established by the Supreme Court in <em>Sell v. United States, </em>539 U.S. 166, 123 S.Ct. 2174, 156 L.Ed.2d 197 (2003).</p>\n<p id=\"b863-21\">In <em>Sell, </em>the Supreme Court held that an individual accused of a serious crime (against the person or property) who had been found incompetent to stand trial could be forced to take antipsychotic drugs in order to render him competent to stand trial, but such involuntary medication could be ordered only after satisfying the following prerequisites. As summarized (and abbreviated) by the district court, these prerequisites are:</p>\n<blockquote id=\"b863-22\">(1) <em>Important </em>governmental interests are at stake;</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b863-23\">(2) Involuntary medication will <em>significantly further </em>those concomitant [governmental] interests;</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b863-25\">(3) Involuntary medication is <em>necessary </em>to further those interests; and</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b864-3\"><page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"836\">*836</page-number>(4) Administration of the drugs is <em>medically appropriate, </em>i.e., in the patient\u2019s best medical interest in light of his medical condition.</blockquote>\n<p id=\"b864-4\">District court, docket 89 at 3-4 (emphasis in original, but quotations and citations omitted).<footnotemark>1</footnotemark></p>\n<p id=\"b864-5\">In this case, the district court made the findings required by <em>Sell </em>and ordered that Fuller may be involuntarily medicated pursuant to <em>Sell. </em>In his appeal, Fuller challenges the district court\u2019s holding <em>only </em>on the basis of the first <em>Sell </em>prerequisite. Accordingly, we examine this first prerequisite in more detail. The Court held:</p>\n<blockquote id=\"A1C\">First, a court must find that <em>important </em>governmental interests are at stake. The government\u2019s interest in bringing to trial an individual accused of a serious crime is important. That is so whether the offense is a serious crime against the person or a serious crime against property. ... Courts, however, must consider the facts of the individual case in evaluating the government\u2019s interest in prosecution.</blockquote>\n<p id=\"b864-6\"><em>Sell, </em>539 U.S. at 180, 123 S.Ct. at 2184. Thus, if a crime of which Fuller is accused is \u201cserious,\u201d then the government\u2019s interest in prosecuting Fuller is \u201cimportant.\u201d And, in evaluating the government\u2019s interest in prosecuting Fuller, courts \u201cmust consider the facts of the individual case.\u201d <em>Id.</em></p>\n<p id=\"b864-11\">Fuller argues on appeal that the district court erred in concluding that Fuller\u2019s charged offense was a serious crime, and thus he argues that the government has failed to satisfy the first <em>Sell </em>prerequisite \u2014 the existence of important governmental interests. We disagree.</p>\n<p id=\"b864-12\">To resolve this case, we need not decide whether the charged offense here \u2014 felon in possession of a firearm \u2014 is, as a general matter, a serious crime. As noted, the Supreme Court expressly held, with respect to this first <em>Sell </em>prerequisite, that courts \u201cmust consider the facts of the individual case in evaluating the government\u2019s interest in prosecution.\u201d <em>Id. </em>The facts of the instant case involve the discovery of the firearm in Fuller\u2019s possession during a parole officer\u2019s visit to Fuller\u2019s residence triggered by Fuller\u2019s threat to harm law enforcement officers.<footnotemark>2</footnotemark> Under any reasonable standard derived from <em>Sell, </em>the crime of which Fuller is accused is a serious crime, creating an important governmental interest in prosecuting Fuller.<footnotemark>3</footnotemark></p>\n<p id=\"b865-4\"><page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"837\">*837</page-number>For the foregoing reasons, we conclude that the result of this case is dictated by the Supreme Court decision in <em>Sell, </em>and that the judgment of the district court is due to be affirmed.</p>\n<p id=\"b865-5\">AFFIRMED.</p>\n<footnote label=\"1\">\n<p id=\"b864-7\">. The Court in <em>Sell </em>also held that: \"We ... believe that a court, asked to approve forced administration of drugs for purposes of rendering a defendant competent to stand trial, should ordinarily determine whether the Government seeks, or has first sought, permission for forced administration of drugs on these other Harper-type grounds; and, if not, why not.\u201d <em>Id. </em>at 183, 123 S.Ct. at 2186. In this case, the district court did examine whether the involuntary administration of drugs to Fuller would be justified on the basis of the grounds discussed in <em>Washington v. Harper, </em>494 U.S. 210, 110 S.Ct. 1028, 108 L.Ed.2d 178 (1990) (holding that an inmate with a serious mental illness may be treated with anti-psychotic drugs against his will, if the inmate is dangerous to himself or others and the treatment is in the inmate\u2019s medical interest). The district court found that involuntary administration of drugs in this case was not justified on the basis of <em>Harper </em>grounds. Fuller does not challenge this holding on appeal.</p>\n</footnote>\n<footnote label=\"2\">\n<p id=\"b864-14\">. On appeal, Fuller argues that his comments were misunderstood as a threat. However, the district court heard the relevant testimony, and expressly found as a fact that Fuller had issued a threat in the instant case. Because this finding of fact is not clearly erroneous, the facts of the instant case include the fact of defendant's threat.</p>\n</footnote>\n<footnote label=\"3\">\n<p id=\"b864-15\">. Because the facts surrounding the charged offense in this case amply support the conclusion that this is a serious crime, and because the Supreme Court in Sell has mandated consideration of such facts, we need not in this case elaborate further with respect to the <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"837\">*837</page-number>reach of the <em>Sell </em>decision. For example, we need not address the weight to be accorded to the fact that the statutory maximum sentence is ten years. And although the very structure of the felon in possession offense would seem to invite consideration of the nature of the prior conviction by virtue of which Fuller was rendered a felon, we need not in this case decide whether it was appropriate to consider Fuller\u2019s prior felony conviction (which incidentally was aggravated assault on a police officer). Finally, although established criminal justice principles would seem to indicate that the seriousness of the charged offense is aggravated by a criminal history of prior convictions of serious criminal behavior- \u2014 see, e.g., the Sentencing Guidelines \u2014 we need not so decide in this case because we readily conclude that Fuller's charged offense is a serious crime without taking into consideration Fuller\u2019s criminal history.</p>\n</footnote>\n</opinion>\n</casebody>\n",
