Bicket, </em>497 Fed.Appx. 679 (8th Cir.2013) (per curiam), appeals the district court\u2019s<footnotemark>1</footnotemark> order denying his 28 U.S.C. \u00a7 2255 motion without an evidentiary hearing. In his motion, Bicket claimed that his trial counsel provided ineffective assistance by failing to move to dismiss the indictment on speedy-trial grounds, and by failing to communicate a government plea offer.</p>\n<p id=\"b636-23\">Following de novo review, we conclude the denial of relief was proper. The record establishes that Bicket\u2019s counsel sought continuances to prepare for trial, that Bicket waived his speedy-trial rights, and that counsel\u2019s decision not to seek dismissal of the indictment did not amount to deficient performance. <em>See Thomas v. United States, </em>737 F.3d 1202, 1206, 1209 (8th Cir.2013) (standard of review; decision whether to move to dismiss for speedy trial violation is tactical decision of trial strategy), <em>cert. denied, </em>\u2014 U.S.-, 134 S.Ct. 2323, 189 L.Ed.2d 198 (2014). Further, Bicket\u2019s attestations in support of his second ineffective \u2014 assistance claim \u2014 that his counsel \u201cnever\u201d informed him of a plea offer \u2014 were contradicted by the record, including by his testimony at his sentencing hearing that he was aware of a specific eve-of-trial plea offer. The denial of relief without an evidentiary hearing was thus not an abuse of discretion. <em>See Winters v. United States, </em>716 F.3d 1098, 1103 (8th Cir.) (\u00a7 2255 motion may be dismissed without hearing if movant\u2019s allegations, accepted as true, would not entitle him to relief; or if allegations cannot be accepted as true because they are contradicted by <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"609\">*609</page-number>record, are inherently incredible, or are conclusions rather than statements of fact), <em>cert. denied, </em>\u2014 U.S.-, 134 S.Ct. 447, 187 L.Ed.2d 312 (2013).</p>\n<p id=\"b637-7\">Accordingly, we affirm.</p>\n<footnote label=\"1\">\n<p id=\"b636-19\">.
