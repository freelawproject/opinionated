GORSUCH, Circuit Judge.</author>\n<p id=\"b756-16\">Johnny Gregory, a federal prisoner incarcerated in Colorado, has for years sought relief from a conviction and sentence a Georgia federal court imposed on him. He first and repeatedly pursued his case up and down the Eleventh Circuit. Failing there, he eventually applied to a Colorado district court for a writ of coram nobis or a writ of habeas corpus pursuant to 28 U.S.C. \u00a7 2241. The district court held, however, that a writ of coram nobis was unavailable because Mr. Gregory is still serving a prison sentence and he is obligated to proceed in habeas under controlling precedent. <em>See, e.g., United States v. Torres, </em>282 F.3d 1241, 1245 (10th Cir. 2002). The district court also found that, because Mr. Gregory seeks relief from his conviction and sentence, his habeas petition properly arises under 28 U.S.C. \u00a7 2255, not \u00a7 2241. Finally, the court noted that \u00a7 2255 motions must be brought in the court in which the sentence was imposed, here the Northern District of Georgia. <em>See </em>28 U.S.C. \u00a7 2255(a). Neither did the court find any reasoned argument in Mr. Gregory\u2019s papers suggesting that a \u00a7 2255 motion might be somehow inadequate or ineffective for testing the legality of his conviction. <em>See id. </em>\u00a7 2255(e).</p>\n<p id=\"b756-19\">Mr. Gregory seeks to appeal the dismissal of his suit. He does not, however, establish that the district court erred in characterizing his petitions as a successive \u00a7 2255 collateral attack on his conviction and sentence. And before he may pursue a successive \u00a7 2255 motion in district court he must first obtain permission from the court of appeals. <em>See </em>28 U.S.C. \u00a7 2255(h). To be sure, our precedent allows us to construe appeals like this one as requests to pursue a successive \u00a7 2255 motion. <em>See Spitznas v. Boone, </em>464 F.3d 1213, 1219 n. 8 (10th Cir.2006). But we must deny Mr. Gregory\u2019s request because he must ad<page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"729\">*729</page-number>dress it to the \u201cappropriate court of appeals,\u201d here the Eleventh Circuit which oversees the Northern District of Georgia where Mr. Gregory\u2019s sentence was imposed. <em>In re Cline, </em>531 F.3d 1249, 1250 (10th Cir.2008). Neither does Mr. Gregory present newly discovered evidence suggesting his innocence or identify a new rule of constitutional law retroactively applicable to his case, as he must under \u00a7 2255(h). Nor has he offered any reasoned basis for challenging the district court\u2019s conclusion that \u00a7 2255 provides an adequate and effective remedy.</p>\n<p id=\"b757-5\">Construing Mr. Gregory\u2019s appeal as a request for a certificate of appealability, it is denied. His motion to proceed <em>informa pauperis </em>and remaining pending motions are also denied. The appeal is dismissed. Mr. Gregory is reminded that he must pay the filing fee in full.</p>\n<footnote label=\"*\">\n<p id=\"b756-17\"> This order is not binding precedent except under the doctrines of law of the case, res judicata, and collateral estoppel. It may be cited, however, for its persuasive value consistent with Fed. R.App. P. 32.1 and 10th Cir. R. 32.1.</p>\n</footnote>\n</opinion>\n</casebody>\n",
