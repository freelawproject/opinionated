Respondent moves to dismiss the petition for lack of jurisdiction.</p>\n<p id=\"b107-18\">The Government asks us to dismiss the petition, arguing that this Court lacks jurisdiction to consider it under 8 U.S.C. \u00a7 1252(a)(2)(C) and (D) because Petitioner does not raise any non-frivolous, colorable questions of law or constitutional claims with regard to the denial of CAT relief. However, we have not expressly held that the jurisdictional bar contained in \u00a7 1252(a)(2)(C) applies to claims for deferral of removal under the CAT. Nevertheless, we need not confront the jurisdictional question because we may exercise hypothetical jurisdiction \u201cwhere the jurisdictional constraints are imposed by statute, not the Constitution, and where the jurisdictional issues are complex and the substance of the claim is ... plainly without merit.\u201d <em>Ivanishvili v. U.S. Dep\u2019t of Justice, </em>433 F.3d 332, 338 n. 2 (2d Cir. 2006). We have reviewed the Petitioner\u2019s objections to the IJ and BIA\u2019s factual and legal determinations regarding his application for CAT relief, and they are merit-less.</p>\n<p id=\"b107-19\">Accordingly, we assert hypothetical jurisdiction, and the petition for review is DENIED. It is further ORDERED that Respondent\u2019s motion to dismiss and Peti<page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"80\">*80</page-number>tioner\u2019s motion for a stay of removal are DENIED as moot.</p>\n</opinion>\n</casebody>\n",
