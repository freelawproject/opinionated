Wolpoff &amp; Abramson, L.L.P., </em>321 F.3d 292, 300 (2d Cir.2003). \u201cA district court may set aside a jury\u2019s verdict pursuant to Rule 50 only where there is such a complete absence of evidence supporting the verdict that the jury\u2019s findings could only have been the result of sheer surmise and conjecture, or there is such an overwhelming amount of evidence in favor of the movant that reasonable and fair minded men could not arrive at a verdict against him.\u201d <em>Bucalo v. Shelter Island Union Free Sch. Dist., </em>691 F.3d 119, 127-28 (2d Cir.2012) (internal quotation marks omitted).</p>\n<p id=\"b43-16\">Although we conclude that the IWWC lacked jurisdiction over Watrous\u2019s property and affirm the district court\u2019s order granting partial summary judgment on that issue, we recognize that the scope of the IWWC\u2019s jurisdiction is a difficult question. Were the Appellants\u2019 improper exercise of jurisdiction the only basis for Watrous\u2019s claim, Appellants might be entitled to qualified immunity on the ground that the right violated was not \u201cclearly established.\u201d In this case, however, evidence of Appellants\u2019 other conduct with regard to Watrous\u2019s property was more than sufficient to support both the district court\u2019s conclusion that Appellants were not entitled to qualified immunity and the jury\u2019s verdict in favor of Watrous.</p>\n<p id=\"b43-17\">We have considered all of Appellants\u2019 arguments and find them to be without merit. Accordingly, for the reasons set forth above, the judgment of the district court is AFFIRMED.</p>\n<footnote label=\"1\">\n<p id=\"b43-12\">. <em>Watrous v.
