We granted Wright a certificate of appealability on the issue of \u201c[w]hether the district court violated <em>Clisby v. Jones, </em>960 F.2d 925 (11th Cir.1992), by failing to address Wright\u2019s claim that the State violated his Sixth Amendment right to a speedy trial.\u201d The State concedes that the district court did not address Wright\u2019s Sixth Amendment speedy trial claim.</p>\n<p id=\"b870-8\">\u201cWhen examining a district court\u2019s denial of a \u00a7 2254 habeas petition, we review questions of law and mixed questions of law and fact <em>de novo, </em>and findings of fact for clear error.\u201d <em>Stewart v. Sec\u2019y, Dep\u2019t of Corr., </em>476 F.3d 1193, 1208 (11th Cir.2007). In <em>Clisby, </em>we expressed our \u201cdeep concern over the piecemeal litigation of federal habeas petitions filed by state prisoners, as exemplified by the district court\u2019s failure to resolve all claims in [that] case.\u201d 960 F.2d at 935. Thus, we held that district courts must resolve all claims for relief raised in \u00a7 2254 habeas petitions, regardless of whether relief is granted or denied. <em>Id. </em>at 936. A \u201cclaim for relief\u2019 is defined as \u201cany allegation of a constitutional violation.\u201d <em>Id. </em>Allegations of distinct constitutional violations constitute separate claims for relief, \u201ceven if both allegations arise from the same alleged set of operative facts.\u201d <em>Id.</em></p>\n<p id=\"b870-10\">In this case, Wright\u2019s memorandum of law in support of his habeas petition raised two grounds for relief: (1) a violation of his right to a speedy trial under the Interstate Agreement on Detainers Act (IADA) and (2) a violation of his right to a speedy trial under the Sixth Amendment. The district court held that Wright\u2019s IADA claim was procedurally barred. However, as the State concedes, the district court did not address Wright\u2019s Sixth Amendment claim. Therefore, its order did not comply with the requirements of <em>Clisby. See Long v. United States, </em>626 F.3d 1167, 1170 (11th Cir.2010) (\u201c[T]he district court must develop a record sufficient to facilitate our review of all issues pertinent to an application for a COA and, by extension, the ultimate merit of any issues for which a COA is granted.\u201d). We vacate without prejudice and remand for the district court to rule on Wright\u2019s Sixth Amendment claim.</p>\n<p id=\"b870-11\">VACATED AND REMANDED.</p>\n</opinion>\n</casebody>\n",
