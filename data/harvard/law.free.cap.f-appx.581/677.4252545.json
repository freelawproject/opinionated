We have jurisdiction under 8 U.S.C. \u00a7 1252. We review for substantial evidence the agency\u2019s factual findings, includ<page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"678\">*678</page-number>ing adverse credibility findings. <em>Shrestha v. Holder, </em>590 F.3d 1034, 1039 (9th Cir. 2010). We deny the petition for review.</p>\n<p id=\"b706-4\">Romero and Ortiz do not challenge the agency\u2019s dispositive finding that their asylum applications were untimely, and that they failed to establish changed or extraordinary circumstances to excuse their untimeliness. Accordingly, we deny the petition for review as to their asylum claims.</p>\n<p id=\"b706-5\">With respect to Romero\u2019s withholding of removal claim, substantial evidence supports the agency\u2019s adverse credibility determination based on Romero\u2019s omission from his declaration that the gang members he fears are the same former guerrilla members who had previously attempted to recruit him. <em>See Shrestha, </em>590 F.3d at 1048 (adverse credibility determination was reasonable under the \u201ctotality of circumstances\u201d); <em>see also Zamanov v. Holder, </em>649 F.3d 969, 973 (9th Cir.2011) (\u201cMaterial alterations in the applicant\u2019s account of persecution are sufficient to support an adverse credibility finding.\u201d). Romero\u2019s explanations do not compel a contrary result. <em>See Lata v. INS, </em>204 F.3d 1241, 1245 (9th Cir.2000). We reject Romero\u2019s contention that the IJ did not provide a reason for her adverse credibility finding. Apart from this, Romero does not challenge the agency\u2019s dispositive adverse credibility determination. Thus, in the absence of credible testimony, Romero\u2019s withholding of removal claim fails. <em>See Farah v. Ashcroft, </em>348 F.3d 1153, 1156 (9th Cir.2003).</p>\n<p id=\"b706-6\">With respect to Ortiz\u2019s withholding of removal claim, substantial evidence supports the agency\u2019s finding that she failed to establish that a protected ground was or would be at least one central reason for her past mistreatment or fear of returning to El Salvador. <em>See Parussimova v. Mukasey, </em>555 F.3d 734, 740 (9th Cir.2009) (under the REAL ID Act, a protected ground must be \u201cone central reason\u201d for an applicant\u2019s persecution); <em>Zetino v. Holder, </em>622 F.3d 1007, 1016 (9th Cir.2010) (\u201cAn alien\u2019s desire to be free from harassment by criminals motivated by theft or random violence by gang members bears no nexus to a protected ground.\u201d). Thus, Ortiz\u2019s withholding of removal claim fails.</p>\n<p id=\"b706-10\">PETITION FOR REVIEW DENIED.</p>\n<footnote label=\"**\">\n<p id=\"b705-22\"> This disposition is not appropriate for publication and is not precedent except as provided by 9th Cir.
