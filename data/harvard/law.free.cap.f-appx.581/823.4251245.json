Rosier challenges the two-level enhancement of her sentence for targeting a vulnerable victim. United States Sentencing Guidelines Manual \u00a7 3Al.l(b)(l) (Nov. 2013). We affirm.</p>\n<p id=\"b851-23\">The district court did not clearly err in finding that Rosier \u201cknew or should have known that a victim of [her] offense was a <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"824\">*824</page-number>vulnerable victim.\u201d <em>Id. </em>Rosier worked as a secretary and a data entry clerk for a company that provided in-home phlebotomy services for elderly and invalid patients. Rosier gave her network user-name and password to a person who then accessed the company\u2019s database and downloaded the personal identification information of 1,808 patients. The district court was entitled to find that Rosier had observed the birthdates and ailments of patients and knew the patients were susceptible to identity theft because of their \u201cadvancing or elderly age\u201d and because of their medical conditions. <em>See United States v. Bradley, </em>644 F.3d 1213, 1289 (11th Cir. 2011) (concluding that AIDS and hemophilia patients \u201cwere vulnerable due to their medical condition\u201d); <em>United States v. Yount, </em>960 F.2d 955, 957 (11th Cir.1992) (concluding that trust accountholders were vulnerable victims because of their advanced age and inability to manage their finances).</p>\n<p id=\"b852-4\">Even if the district court had erred by enhancing Rosier\u2019s sentence, that error would have been be harmless. The district court stated that it would have imposed the same sentence even if it had \u201cimproperly imposed\u201d the enhancement. <em>See United States v. Keene, </em>470 F.3d 1347, 1349 (11th Cir.2006). Rosier\u2019s sentence, which is eight months less than the low end of her advisory guidelines range of 57 to 71 months and well below her maximum statutory sentence of five years, is reasonable.</p>\n<p id=\"b852-5\">We AFFIRM Rosier\u2019s sentence.</p>\n</opinion>\n</casebody>\n",
