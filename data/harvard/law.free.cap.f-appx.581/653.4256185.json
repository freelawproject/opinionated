We have jurisdiction pursuant to 28 U.S.C. \u00a7 1291, and we affirm.</p>\n<p id=\"b681-24\">\u201cWe review the district court\u2019s dismissal pursuant to its local rules for abuse of discretion. \u2018Only in rare cases will we question the exercise of discretion in connection with the application of local rules.\u2019 \u201d <em>Ghazali v. Moran, </em>46 F.3d 52, 53 (9th Cir.1995) (internal citation omitted) (per curiam).</p>\n<p id=\"b681-25\">Civil Rule 83.11 of the Local Rules of the United States District Court for the Southern District of California states:</p>\n<blockquote id=\"b681-26\">Any person who is appearing propria persona, (without an attorney) (i.e. pro se) must appear personally for such purpose and may not delegate that duty to any other person, including husband or wife, or another party on the same side appearing without an attorney. Any person appearing propria persona is <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"654\">*654</page-number>bound by these rules of court and by the Fed.R.Civ.P. or Fed.R. Crim.P., as appropriate. Failure to comply therewith may be ground for dismissal or judgment by default.</blockquote>\n<p id=\"b682-4\">When determining what constitutes the unauthorized practice of law, we look to state law. <em>In re Reynoso, </em>477 F.3d 1117, 1125 (9th Cir.2007). Under California law, the practice of law \u201cmeans more than just appearing in court,\u201d and extends to providing legal advice and preparing legal documents. <em>Estate of Condon, </em>65 Cal.App.4th 1138, 1142, 76 Cal.Rptr.2d 922 (1998).</p>\n<p id=\"b682-5\">The district court properly found that Mykal was effectively acting as Helen\u2019s counsel by drafting her pleadings and submissions, and by contacting the court on her behalf. Dismissing the case without prejudice was therefore appropriate.</p>\n<p id=\"b682-6\">AFFIRMED.</p>\n<footnote label=\"**\">\n<p id=\"b681-27\"> This disposition is not appropriate for publication and is not precedent except as provided by 9th Cir.
