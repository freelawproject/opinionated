In denying his applications, the Administrative Law Judge (\u201cALJ\u201d), found that Short could work a full eight-hour day by alternating between sitting and standing and could do routine, uncomplicated light work. In making these findings, the ALJ in effect rejected the opinions of Short\u2019s treating physician, Dr. Robert Martin, who opined that (1) Short could only work six hours in an eighthour work day and (2) Short frequently experienced headaches severe enough to interfere with the attention and concentration needed to perform even simple tasks. On appeal, Short argues that the ALJ failed to apply the appropriate legal standard to Dr. Martin\u2019s opinions, because the ALJ failed to articulate good cause as to why she did not accord those opinions substantial weight. After thorough review, we vacate and remand for the ALJ to state with particularity the weight given to Dr. Martin\u2019s opinions and the reasons for that weight.</p>\n<p id=\"b783-7\">In a social security case, we review the agency\u2019s legal conclusions <em>de novo, </em>and its factual findings to determine whether they are supported by substantial evidence. <em>Ingram v. Comm\u2019r of Soc. Sec., </em>496 F.3d 1253, 1260 (11th Cir.2007). Substantial evidence is defined as relevant evidence that a reasonable person would accept as adequate to support a conclusion. <em>Miles v. Chater, </em>84 F.3d 1397, 1400 (11th Cir.1996). There is no presumption that the agency followed the appropriate legal standards in deciding a claim for benefits or that the legal conclusions reached were valid. <em>Id.</em></p>\n<p id=\"b783-8\">The Social Security regulations outline a five-step process used to determine whether a claimant is disabled: (1) whether the claimant is currently engaged in substantial gainful activity; (2) whether the claimant has a severe impairment or combination of impairments; (3) whether the impairment meets or equals the severity of the specified impairments in the Listing of Impairments; (4) whether, based on a residual functional capacity (\u201cRFC\u201d) assessment, the claimant can perform any of his past relevant work despite the impairment; and (5) whether there are significant numbers of jobs in the national economy that the claimant can perform, given the claimant\u2019s RFC, age, education, and work experience. <em>See Phillips v. Barnhart, </em>357 F.3d 1232, 1237-39 (11th Cir.2004); 20 C.F.R. \u00a7\u00a7 404.1520(a)(4)(i)-(v), 416.920(a)(1), (4)(i)-(v). If an ALJ finds a claimant disabled or not disabled at any given step, the ALJ does not proceed to the next step. 20 C.F.R. \u00a7 416.920(a)(4).</p>\n<p id=\"b783-11\">The RFC is an assessment, based upon all relevant evidence, of a claimant\u2019s remaining ability to do work despite his impairments. <em>Lewis v. Callahan, </em>125 F.3d 1436, 1440 (11th Cir.1997). When determining a claimant\u2019s RFC, the ALJ must give the opinion of a treating physician \u201csubstantial or considerable weight unless good cause is shown to the contrary.\u201d <em>Phillips, </em>357 F.3d at 1240 (quotation omitted). Good cause exists when the: (1) treating physician\u2019s opinion is not bolstered by the evidence; (2) evidence supports a contrary finding; or (3) treating physician\u2019s opinion is conclusory or inconsistent with the doctor\u2019s own medical records. <em>Winschel v. Comm\u2019r of Soc. Sec., </em>631 F.3d 1176, 1179 (11th Cir.2011). If the ALJ disregards or accords less weight to the opinion of a treating physician, the ALJ must clearly articulate the reasons <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"756\">*756</page-number>for according that opinion less weight, and the failure to do so is reversible. <em>Lewis, </em>125 F.3d at 1440.</p>\n<p id=\"b784-4\">Without a statement of the weight given to the opinion and the reasons for that weight, it is impossible for a reviewing court to determine if the ultimate decision on the merits of the claim is rational and supported by substantial evidence. <em>Cowart v. Schweiker, </em>662 F.2d 731, 735 (11th Cir.1981). Therefore, when the ALJ fails to \u201cstate with at least some measure of clarity the grounds for [the] decision,\u201d we will decline to affirm \u201csimply because some rationale might have supported the ALJ\u2019s conclusion.\u201d <em>Owens v. Heckler, </em>748 F.2d 1511, 1516 (11th Cir.1984). In such a situation, \u201cto say that [the ALJ\u2019s] decision is supported by substantial evidence approaches an abdication of [our] duty to scrutinize the record as a whole to determine whether the conclusions reached are rational.\u201d <em>Cowart, </em>662 F.2d at 735 (citation and quotation omitted).</p>\n<p id=\"b784-5\">Here, the record reveals that the ALJ failed to articulate specific reasons for declining to give Dr. Martin\u2019s opinion controlling weight. The ALJ provided only that she accorded \u201cweight\u201d to Dr. Martin\u2019s opinion. While the ALJ did not say whether she accorded Dr. Martin\u2019s opinion substantial and considerable weight or a lesser amount, it is apparent that the ALJ accorded less than substantial weight to Dr. Martin\u2019s opinion that Short could only stand and/or walk for 2 hours and could sit for 4 hours in an eight hour workday, since Short\u2019s RFC contained a contrary finding. Additionally, the ALJ appeared to reject Dr. Martin\u2019s opinion that Short\u2019s headaches would interfere with the attention and concentration needed to perform simple work tasks.</p>\n<p id=\"b784-6\">To the extent the Commissioner identifies one \u201carticulated\u201d reason that the ALJ did not accord Dr. Martin\u2019s opinion controlling weight \u2014 which actually appears to be an articulated reason for <em>crediting </em>Dr. Martin\u2019s opinion that Short\u2019s concussion was resolved \u2014 we are unpersuaded. Indeed, it is not clear from the ALJ\u2019s decision that this was a clearly articulated reason for discrediting other opinions that Dr. Martin set forth in the RFC Questionnaire.</p>\n<p id=\"b784-8\">We are also unconvinced by the Commissioner\u2019s argument that substantial evidence in the form of opinions of medical doctors, benign medical findings, and Short\u2019s own statements, support the ALJ\u2019s findings. This argument presupposes that the ALJ rejected Dr. Martin\u2019s opinions based on that specific evidence (opinions of medical doctors, benign medical findings, and Short\u2019s own statements). Yet, as we\u2019ve explained, because the ALJ did not state why she rejected Dr. Martin\u2019s opinions, we do not know the basis and cannot determine whether it is supported by substantial evidence. <em>Cowart, </em>662 F.2d at 735.</p>\n<p id=\"b784-9\">Finally, we reject the Commissioner\u2019s argument that requiring more detail from the ALJ would go beyond our precedent. To begin with, several of the cases the Commissioner cites do not address the threshold requirement that the ALJ state with particularity the weight accorded to a treating physician\u2019s opinion. <em>See Sharfarz v. Bowen, </em>825 F.2d 278, 279-80 (11th Cir. 1987); <em>Elam v. Railroad Retirement Bd., </em>921 F.2d 1210, 1215 (11th Cir.1991). Moreover, requiring the ALJ to explain why she did not accord controlling weight to Dr. Martin\u2019s two opinions fits squarely within the holding of <em>Winschel. </em>There, the ALJ only referenced the treating physician, but did not mention the physician\u2019s medical opinion or give that opinion considerable weight. 631 F.3d at 1179. We found that, without clearly articulated grounds for rejecting the opinion, we could <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"757\">*757</page-number>not determine whether the ALJ\u2019s conclusions were rational and supported by substantial evidence. <em>Id. </em>Here, because the ALJ did not articulate grounds for rejecting Dr. Martin\u2019s opinions, we encounter the same issue we did in <em>Winschel.</em></p>\n<p id=\"b785-5\">In short, without a clear articulation of the reasons the ALJ rejected Dr. Martin\u2019s opinion, it is impossible on review to determine whether the ultimate decision was rational and supported by substantial evidence. <em>Cowart, </em>662 F.2d at 735. Accordingly, this case is remanded for the ALJ to state with particularity the weight given to Dr. Martin\u2019s opinion and the reasons for that weight.</p>\n<p id=\"b785-6\">VACATED AND REMANDED.</p>\n</opinion>\n</casebody>\n",
