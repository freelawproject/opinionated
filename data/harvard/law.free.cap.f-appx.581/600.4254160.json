Her counsel has moved for leave to withdraw, and has filed a brief under <em>Anders v. California, </em>386 U.S. 738, 87 S.Ct. 1396, 18 L.Ed.2d 493 (1967), challenging her sentence. Dejong has filed a supplemental brief, also challenging her sentence, and additionally suggesting that she did not understand an appeal waiver set forth in her plea agreement, and that her counsel was ineffective.</p>\n<p id=\"b628-20\">To begin, we decline to enforce the appeal waiver set forth in Dejong\u2019s plea agreement. <em>See United States v. Boneshirt, </em>662 F.3d 509, 516 (8th Cir.2011) (this court has frequently declined to enforce appeal waiver when record does not establish that district court engaged in colloquy required by Fed.R.Crim.P. 11(b)(1)(N)), <em>cert. denied, </em>\u2014 U.S.-, 132 S.Ct. 1613, 182 L.Ed.2d 217 (2012). We also decline to consider any ineffective-assistance claim on direct appeal. <em>See United States v. McAdory, </em>501 F.3d 868, 872-73 (8th Cir. 2007) (appellate court ordinarily defers ineffective-assistance claims to 28 U.S.C. \u00a7 2255 proceedings). Upon careful review of the district court\u2019s sentencing decision, we conclude that no abuse of discretion occurred. <em>See United States v. Feemster, </em>572 F.3d 455, 461-62 (8th Cir.2009) (en banc) (describing appellate review of sentencing decisions); <em>see also United States v. Franik, </em>687 F.3d 988, 991 (8th Cir.2012) (factors that have already been taken into account in calculating advisory Guidelines range can nevertheless form basis of variance; concluding that no abuse of discretion occurred where district court found Guidelines would not accomplish objectives of 18 U.S.C. \u00a7 3553(a) without upward variance).</p>\n<p id=\"b628-23\">As for counsel\u2019s motion to withdraw, we conclude that allowing counsel to withdraw at this time would not be consistent with the Eighth Circuit\u2019s 1994 Amendment to Part V of the Plan to Implement The <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"601\">*601</page-number>Criminal Justice Act of 1964. We therefore deny counsel\u2019s motion to withdraw as premature, without prejudice to counsel refiling the motion upon fulfilling the duties set forth in the Amendment.</p>\n<p id=\"b629-5\">Judge Colloton would grant counsel\u2019s motion to withdraw. <em>See United States v. Eredia, </em>No. 13-3538, 578 Fed.Appx. 620, 621, 2014 WL 4920905, at *1 (8th Cir. Oct. 2, 2014) (unpublished) (Colloton, J., concurring in part and dissenting in part).</p>\n<footnote label=\"1\">\n<p id=\"b628-18\">. The Honorable Dean Whipple, United States District Judge for the Western District of Missouri.</p>\n</footnote>\n</opinion>\n</casebody>\n",
