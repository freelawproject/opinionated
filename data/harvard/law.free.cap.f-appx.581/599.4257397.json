His counsel has moved for leave to withdraw, and has filed a brief under <em>Anders v. California, </em>386 U.S. 738, 87 S.Ct. 1396, 18 L.Ed.2d 493 (1967), arguing that Stallcup\u2019s sentence is substantively unreasonable.</p>\n<p id=\"b627-25\">Upon careful review, we conclude that the district court did not impose an unreasonable sentence. <em>See United States v. Feemster, </em>572 F.3d 455, 461-62, 464 (8th Cir.2009) (en banc) (describing appellate review of sentencing decisions; where sentence falls within Guidelines range, appeals court may, but is not required to, apply presumption of reasonableness).</p>\n<p id=\"b627-26\">As for counsel\u2019s motion to withdraw, we conclude that allowing counsel to withdraw at this time would not be consistent with the Eighth Circuit\u2019s 1994 Amendment to Part V of the Plan to Implement the Criminal Justice Act of 1964. We therefore deny counsel\u2019s motion to withdraw as premature, without prejudice to counsel refiling the motion upon fulfilling the duties set forth in the Amendment.</p>\n<p id=\"b627-27\">Judge Colloton would grant counsel\u2019s motion to withdraw. <em>See United States v. Eredia, </em>No. 13-3538, 578 Fed.Appx. 620, 621, 2014 WL 4920905, at *1 (8th Cir. Oct. 2, 2014) (unpublished) (Colloton, J., concurring in part and dissenting in part).</p>\n<footnote label=\"1\">\n<p id=\"b627-22\">. The Honorable Timothy L. Brooks, United States District Judge for the Western District of Arkansas.</p>\n</footnote>\n</opinion>\n</casebody>\n",
