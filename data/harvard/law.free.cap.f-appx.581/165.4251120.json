On appeal, Ramirez-Cortez challenges the reasonableness of his sentence. We affirm.</p>\n<p id=\"b194-19\">We review a sentence for reasonableness \u201cunder a deferential abuse-of-discretion standard.\u201d <em>Gall v. United States, </em>552 U.S. 38, 41, 51, 128 S.Ct. 586, 169 L.Ed.2d 445 (2007). Our review entails appellate consideration of both the procedural and substantive reasonableness of the sentence. <em>Id. </em>at 51, 128 S.Ct. 586. In evaluating procedural reasonableness, we consider whether the district court properly considered the advisory nature of the Sentencing Guidelines, correctly calculated the defendant\u2019s Guidelines range, gave the parties an opportunity to argue for an <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"167\">*167</page-number>appropriate sentence, considered the 18 U.S.C. \u00a7 3553(a) (2012) factors, and sufficiently explained the selected sentence. <em>Id. </em>at 49-51, 128 S.Ct. 586. If there is no significant procedural error, we review the sentence for substantive reasonableness, \u201ctak[ing] into account the totality of the circumstances.\u201d <em>Id. </em>at 51, 128 S.Ct. 586. We presume a sentence within or below a properly calculated Guidelines range to be substantively reasonable. <em>United States v. Sus, </em>674 F.3d 278, 289 (4th Cir.2012).</p>\n<p id=\"b195-5\">Ramirez-Cortez asserts that the district court procedurally erred in determining that it lacked authority to vary downward on the basis of the sentencing disparities that result from selected application of the fast-track program.<footnotemark>*</footnotemark> Ramirez-Cortez contends that the district court improperly concluded that it was bound by this court\u2019s decision in <em>United States v. Perez-Pena, </em>453 F.3d 236 (4th Cir.2006), because the Supreme Court\u2019s subsequent decision in <em>Kimbrough v. United States, </em>552 U.S. 85, 128 S.Ct. 558, 169 L.Ed.2d 481 (2007) (holding that sentencing courts may \u201cvary ... based solely on policy considerations, including disagreements with the Guidelines\u201d), allows a district court to consider such a sentencing disparity.</p>\n<p id=\"b195-6\">This court held in <em>Perez-Pena </em>that any sentencing disparity between defendants receiving fast track plea agreements and those who do not is \u201cwarranted as a matter of law,\u201d because such disparities are sanctioned by Congress and the Sentencing Commission. 453 F.3d at 243 (internal quotation marks omitted). We have not revisited <em>Perez-Pena </em>in a published, precedential decision since <em>Kimbrough, </em>and <em>Perez-Pena </em>remains controlling in this circuit.</p>\n<p id=\"b195-9\">Even if the district court had authority to consider this sentencing disparity, however, we conclude that its reliance on <em>Perez-Pena </em>was harmless. Under harmless error review, we will not reverse the court\u2019s judgment when the error \u201cdid not have a substantial and injurious effect or influence on the result.\u201d <em>See United States v. Lynn, </em>592 F.3d 572, 585 (4th Cir.2010) (internal quotation marks omitted). As the Government correctly asserts, the district court in this case specifically stated that, even if it had authority to do so, it would not grant a downward variance related to the lack of a fast-track plea offer in Ramirez-Cortez\u2019s case.</p>\n<p id=\"b195-10\">Ramirez-Cortez also asserts that his sentence was substantively unreasonable because it was greater than necessary to accomplish the goals of 18 U.S.C. \u00a7 3553(a). The district court, however, fully considered Ramirez-Cortez\u2019s cooperation with federal agents, his employment history, and the support of his family in granting a downward variance and imposing a forty-two-month sentence. Because Ramirez-Cortez does not offer any additional factors to rebut the appellate presumption afforded his below-Guidelines sentence, we conclude that his sentence is substantively reasonable. <em>See Susi, </em>674 F.3d at 289; <em>United States v. Montes-Pineda, </em>445 F.3d 375, 379 (4th Cir.2006).</p>\n<p id=\"b195-11\">Accordingly, we affirm the criminal judgment. We dispense with oral argument because the facts and legal contentions are adequately presented in the ma<page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"168\">*168</page-number>terials before the court and argument would not aid the decisional process.</p>\n<p id=\"b196-4\">\n<em>AFFIRMED.</em>\n</p>\n<footnote label=\"*\">\n<p id=\"b195-7\"> \u201c \u2018Fast-tracking\u2019 refers to a procedure that originated in states along the United States-Mexico border, where district courts experienced high caseloads as a result of immigration violations.\u201d <em>United States v. Perez-Pena, </em>453 F.3d 236, 238 (4th Cir.2006). In conformity with the fast-track practice, prosecutors seek to obtain pre-indictment guilty pleas by offering to move for a downward departure under <em>U.S. Sentencing Guidelines Manual </em>\u00a7 5K3.1, p.s.</p>\n</footnote>\n</opinion>\n</casebody>\n",
