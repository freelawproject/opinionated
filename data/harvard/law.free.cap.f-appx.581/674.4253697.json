We have jurisdiction under 8 U.S.C. \u00a7 1252. We review for substantial evidence the agency\u2019s factual findings, applying the standards governing adverse credibility determinations created by the REAL ID Act, <em>Shrestha v. Holder, </em>590 F.3d 1034, 1039-40 (9th Cir.2010), and review de novo claims of due process violations, <em>Zetino v. Holder, </em>622 F.3d 1007, 1011 (9th Cir.2010). We deny the petition for review.</p>\n<p id=\"b703-12\">Substantial evidence supports the agency\u2019s adverse credibility determination based on the inconsistency between Raj\u2019s statement and a doctor\u2019s letter regarding the origin of his injuries, and the inconsistencies regarding whether Raj was caught in a dispute between political figures or gang members. <em>See Shrestha, </em>590 F.3d at 1048 (adverse credibility determination was reasonable under the \u201ctotality of circumstances\u201d); <em>see also Goel v. Gonzales, </em>490 F.3d 735, 739 (9th Cir.2007) (inconsistencies between testimony and documentary evidence support adverse credibility determination). The agency considered Raj\u2019s explanations for these inconsistencies and was not compelled to accept them. <em>See Zamanov v. Holder, </em>649 F.3d 969, 974 (9th Cir.2011). We reject Raj\u2019s claim that the agency ignored evidence or failed to consider the totality of circumstances. In the absence of credible testimony, Raj\u2019s asylum and withholding of removal claims fail. <em>See Farah v. Ashcroft, </em>348 F.3d 1153, 1156 (9th Cir.2003).</p>\n<p id=\"b703-17\">Raj\u2019s CAT claim also fails because it is based on the same testimony that the agency found not credible, and Raj does not point to any other evidence in the record that compels the finding it is more likely than not he would be tortured by or with the consent or acquiescence of the Indian government if returned. <em>See id. </em>at 1156-57. We reject Raj\u2019s contention that the agency failed to consider all the evidence relevant to his CAT claim. <em>See Almaghzar v. Gonzales, </em>457 F.3d 915, 921-22 (9th Cir.2006).</p>\n<p id=\"b703-18\">Finally, Raj\u2019s due process claim fails. <em>See Lata v. INS, </em>204 F.3d 1241, 1246 (9th Cir.2000) (requiring error and prejudice to prevail on a due process claim).</p>\n<p id=\"b703-19\">PETITION FOR REVIEW DENIED.</p>\n<footnote label=\"**\">\n<p id=\"b703-21\"> This disposition is not appropriate for publication and is not precedent except as provided by 9th Cir.
