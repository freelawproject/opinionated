We conclude that Jackson\u2019s suit is barred by the two-year statute of limitations for \u00a7 1983 actions in Illinois, and affirm.</p>\n<p id=\"b584-20\">As set forth in his complaint, the allegations of which we accept as true for purposes of our review, <em>see Brumfield v. City of Chicago, </em>735 F.3d 619, 622 (7th Cir. 2013), Jackson owned and operated Olympic Advanced Driving School and also taught driver training for four weeks at Hillcrest High School each summer. In July 2009, Jesse White, the Secretary of State of Illinois, cancelled Jackson\u2019s driving instructor\u2019s license and Olympic\u2019s driving-school license, citing provisions of the Illinois Administrative Code that authorized the Secretary of State to cancel the licenses of any person who was <em>\u201ccurrently </em>... a teacher of a State-approved high school driver education program.\u201d III. Admin. Code tit. 92 \u00a7\u00a7 1060.20(0, 1060.120(a)(17) (West 2009) (emphasis added). At an administrative hearing in August, a hearing officer determined that the cancellation of Jackson\u2019s licenses was proper, and Secretary White issued an order adopting the hearing officer\u2019s findings and affirming the cancellation of the licenses. Jackson sought judicial review in state court and succeeded in getting his licenses reinstated on grounds that he had not \u201ccurrently\u201d been teaching in a high school program when the cancellations occurred; <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"557\">*557</page-number>his licenses had been cancelled six days after he last taught driver training at a high school. <em>See Jackson v. White, </em>No. 1-11-3254, 2012 WL 6963332 (Ill.App.Ct. Sept. 24, 2012).</p>\n<p id=\"b585-5\">One month after the state appellate court ruling, in October 2012, Jackson filed this \u00a7 1983 suit against Secretary White, the hearing officer, and two state employees who testified at the hearing, alleging that his licenses had been wrongly revoked without due process. The defendants moved to dismiss the complaint, arguing that the claim was precluded by the state court\u2019s judgment, that the suit was time-barred by the two-year statute of limitations for \u00a7 1983 claims in Illinois, that each defendant had absolute immunity, and that White could not be sued for damages in his official capacity. The district court granted the defendants\u2019 motion to dismiss, agreeing that the suit against White in his official capacity was barred by sovereign immunity, that the administrative hearing officer was protected by absolute judicial immunity, and that the state employees who testified enjoyed absolute immunity as witnesses in an adversarial proceeding. The court rejected the preclusion argument and did not address whether the complaint was untimely.</p>\n<p id=\"b585-6\">On appeal, Jackson has abandoned his claim against Secretary White and challenges only the district court\u2019s rulings as to the hearing officer and witnesses. The appellees contend that the rulings are correct but maintain that the dismissal may also be upheld on the alternative ground of untimeliness. We agree with the defendants that Jackson\u2019s complaint is barred by the two-year state of limitations for \u00a7 1983 actions in Illinois. <em>See </em>735 ILCS 5/13-202; <em>Ray v. Maher, </em>662 F.3d 770, 772 (7th Cir.2011). Even though the district court did not address the issue, we may affirm the judgment on any ground supported in the record that has not been waived. <em>Ennenga v. Starns, </em>677 F.3d 766, 777 (7th Cir.2012). According to the state appellate court\u2019s decision (which Jackson attached to his complaint), Secretary White adopted the hearing officer\u2019s findings and affirmed the cancellation of Jackson\u2019s licenses on August 27, 2009. On that date Jackson\u2019s claim accrued because he knew or should have known that his constitutional rights had been violated. <em>See Savory v. Lyons, </em>469 F.3d 667, 672 (7th Cir.2006). But Jackson did not file his \u00a7 1983 complaint until October 2012, more than three years later. And although Jackson urges that the statute of limitations for his \u00a7 1983 claim was .tolled by his state-court action for judicial review, this is not a justification for tolling under Illinois law. <em>See Savory, </em>469 F.3d at 673-74; <em>Thede v. Kapsas, </em>386 Ill.App.3d 396, 325 Ill.Dec. 97, 897 N.E.2d 345, 351 (2008).</p>\n<p id=\"b585-8\">AFFIRMED.</p>\n</opinion>\n</casebody>\n",
