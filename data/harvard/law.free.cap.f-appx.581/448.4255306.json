Broussard, </em>669 F.3d 537, 546 (5th Cir.2012). Under that standard, Petree must show a forfeited plain (clear or obvious) error that affected her substantial rights. <em>Puckett v. United States, </em>556 U.S. 129, 135, 129 S.Ct. 1423, 173 L.Ed.2d 266 (2009). If she does so, we have the discretion to correct the error, but should do so only if it seriously affects the fairness, integrity, or public reputation of the proceedings. <em>Id. </em>To show the claimed-error affected her substantial rights, Petree \u201cmust demonstrate a reasonable probability that, but for the error, [s]he would not have entered the <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"449\">*449</page-number>plea\u201d. <em>Broussard, </em>669 F.3d at 546 (citation and internal quotation marks omitted).</p>\n<p id=\"b477-5\">In determining whether the factual basis for a guilty plea is sufficient, the district court must compare \u201cthe conduct to which defendant admits\u201d and \u201cthe elements of the offense charged\u201d. <em>Id. </em>The factual basis must be specific enough for the court to determine defendant\u2019s conduct \u201cis within the ambit of the statute\u2019s prohibitions\u201d. <em>Id. </em>(citation and internal quotation marks omitted). Implicit in the acceptance of a guilty plea is the district court\u2019s determination that Petree\u2019s \u201cadmitted conduct satisfied every element of\u2019 the offense. <em>Id. </em>This court \u201c \u2018may look beyond those facts admitted by [Petree] during the plea colloquy and scan the entire record for facts supporting [her] conviction\u2019 and draw any fair inferences from the evidence\u201d. <em>Id. </em>(quoting <em>United States v. Trejo, </em>610 F.3d 308, 313, 317 (5th Cir.2010)).</p>\n<p id=\"b477-6\">Based on the record as a whole, there was a sufficient factual basis for the district court not to have committed the requisite clear or obvious error in determining Petree\u2019s conduct was within the ambit of the charged offense given that, <em>inter alia, </em>Petree admitted the substances were analogues and DEA testing concluded the substances were analogues. Petree also claims the district court failed to find expressly that she knew the substances were controlled substance analogues; nevertheless, she cannot show this alleged failure constituted reversible plain error. <em>See United States v. Desurra, </em>865 F.2d 651, 653 (5th Cir.1989) (\u201cIf a defendant possesses an analogue, with intent to distribute ... defendant need not know that the drug ... is an analogue\u201d.). Furthermore, Petree\u2019s contention that alpha-PVP is not an analogue, which she frames as a distinct legal question, fails for the same reason.</p>\n<p id=\"b477-7\">As for Petree\u2019s constitutional challenge to the CSAEA, this court has held the controlled-substance analogue statute, 21 U.S.C. \u00a7 813, is \u201cclearly and specifically defined, in terms readily comprehensible to the ordinary reader\u201d and \u201cprovides adequate notice of what conduct is prohibited\u201d and, therefore, is not unconstitutionally vague. <em>United States v. Granberry, </em>916 F.2d 1008, 1010 (5th Cir.1990).</p>\n<p id=\"b477-9\">AFFIRMED.</p>\n<footnote label=\"*\">\n<p id=\"b476-19\"> Pursuant to 5th Cir. R. 47.5, the court has determined that this opinion should not be published and is not precedent except under the limited circumstances set forth in 5th Cir. R. 47.5.4.</p>\n</footnote>\n</opinion>\n</casebody>\n",
