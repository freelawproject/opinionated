Under the circumstances of this case, we review only the decision of the BIA. <em>See Yan Chen v. Gonzales, </em>417 F.3d 268, 271 (2d Cir.2005). We assume the parties\u2019 familiarity with the facts and record of the prior proceedings, to which we refer only as necessary to explain our decision to grant the lead petition and remand the case to the BIA.<footnotemark>1</footnotemark></p>\n<p id=\"b105-22\">1. <em>Lead Petition for Review</em></p>\n<p id=\"b105-23\">In reversing the IJ\u2019s grant of CAT deferral, the BIA committed legal error by ignoring and seriously mischaracterizing record evidence regarding the length of Laurent\u2019s detention and the likelihood that he would not receive his medication or be rearrested after release in Haiti. <em>See </em><page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"78\">*78</page-number><em>Mendez v. Holder, </em>566 F.3d 316, 323 (2d Cir.2009) (When the agency overlooks and mischaracterizes important evidence, \u201can error of law has occurred\u201d). The BIA concluded that Laurent\u2019s initial detention upon return to Haiti \u201cmay be as short as a few hours, but will not be more than a few days or weeks.\u201d In doing so, it miseharacterized the declaration of Laurent\u2019s criminal deportee expert, which makes clear that the deportee could be detained for up to two years upon his initial return to Haiti. In concluding that Laurent had failed to provide evidence that he was likely to be rearrested after his release in Haiti, the BIA also ignored record evidence in the form of reports stating that the Haitian government continues to monitor and arbitrarily arrest criminal deportees after their release from initial detention, particularly after the January 2010 earthquake. Finally, in dismissing as speculative the IJ\u2019s finding that Laurent would be unmedicated when detained, the BIA disregarded record evidence that prison officials confiscate and re-sell the medication of mentally ill deportees, are unable to provide medication, and are unlikely to offer proper supervision of Laurent\u2019s bipolar and personality disorder.</p>\n<p id=\"b106-4\">The BIA also engaged in impermissible fact-finding. <em>See Weinong Lin v. Holder, </em>763 F.3d 244, 247 (2d Cir.2014) (\u201c[T]he BIA has no power to find facts.\u201d); 8 C.F.R. \u00a7 1003.1(d)(3)(i), (iv) (the BIA may remand to the IJ for further factfinding if necessary but generally cannot itself engage in any fact-finding);. For example, the BIA improperly found what it termed \u201cshort\u201d detentions insufficient for Laurent\u2019s untreated mental disorder to draw the attention of prison officials. The BIA also assumed, without evidentiary support, that Laurent\u2019s family could \u201ccontinue to assist him even if he is in Haiti,\u201d despite the IJ\u2019s express finding that Laurent would have \u201cno family or financial resources\u201d if deported to Haiti.</p>\n<p id=\"b106-6\">2. <em>Adjustment of Status</em></p>\n<p id=\"b106-7\">In reversing the IJ\u2019s grant of adjustment of status, the BIA properly reviewed <em>de novo </em>the IJ\u2019s weighing of factors and exercised its discretion in determining that the equities in Laurent\u2019s favor, including the potential hardship he faced in Haiti, did not outweigh the adverse factors. <em>See </em>8 C.F.R. \u00a7 1003.1(d)(3)(ii). However, because the BIA erroneously discredited the IJ\u2019s findings of fact regarding the conditions Laurent would face in Haiti, the BIA is directed on remand to reweigh the factors in light of this order. <em>See Noble v. Keisler, </em>505 F.3d 73, 79 (2d Cir.2007) (recognizing that \u201cthe BIA\u2019s declining properly to defer to factual findings by the IJ ... will amount to an error of law\u201d even in the context of generally unreviewable denials of discretionary relief).</p>\n<p id=\"b106-8\">3. <em>Denial of the Motion to Reconsider</em></p>\n<p id=\"b106-9\">The BIA denied Laurent\u2019s motion to reconsider, concluding that it had not applied an incorrect standard of review or engaged in improper fact-finding. Remanding the lead petition \u00bfffectively orders the BIA to address the errors that Laurent raised in his motion to reconsider. We therefore dismiss as moot the consolidated petition for review of the BIA\u2019s decision denying the motion to reconsider. <em>See Koudriachova v. Gonzales, </em>490 F.3d 255, 264 (2d Cir.2007).</p>\n<p id=\"b106-10\">For the foregoing reasons, we GRANT the lead petition for review, VACATE the BIA\u2019s order, DISMISS the consolidated petition for review as moot, and REMAND the case to the BIA.</p>\n<footnote label=\"1\">\n<p id=\"b105-15\">. We resolve Laurent\u2019s petition on legal grounds without reaching the jurisdictional question in his case. <em>See </em>8 U.S.C. \u00a7 1252(a)(2)(D).</p>\n</footnote>\n</opinion>\n</casebody>\n",
