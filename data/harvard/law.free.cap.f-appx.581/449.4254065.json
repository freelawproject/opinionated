(\u201cM2 Software\u201d), appeals the district court\u2019s denial of his motion for preliminary injunction against Defendant-Appellee M2 Technology, Inc. (\u201cM2 Technology\u201d) for trademark infringement and related claims, including unfair competition and state law claims. For the reasons set out below, we AFFIRM.</p>\n<p id=\"b478-5\">Escamilla claims that he has used the M2 trademark for more than 20 years in the information technology industry and that M2 Technology wrongfully adopted the M2 mark for some of the same services provided by M2 Software. Escamilla sought to enjoin M2 Technology from:</p>\n<blockquote id=\"b478-6\">(a) advertising, marketing, selling or rendering any product or service or otherwise using the M2\u00ae trademark or trade name in any form ...;</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b478-7\">(b) representing to any person or entity that they have authority or license to use the M2\u00ae trademark symbol;</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b478-8\">(c) representing to any other person or entity that Defendants and/or their products and services are in any manner associated with, connected to, or affiliated with Plaintiff; and</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b478-9\">(d) using any URL\u2019s incorporating the M2\u00ae term.<footnotemark>1</footnotemark></blockquote>\n<p id=\"b478-10\">The district court referred Escamilla\u2019s motion for preliminary injunction to the magistrate judge, who issued a report and recommendation which found in favor of M2 Technology on every relevant issue and therefore recommending that the motion be denied. The district court, following <em>de novo </em>review of the objections filed by Escamilla and the response by M2 Technology, concluded that the magistrate judge was correct. The district court fully adopted the report and recommendation and denied Escamilla\u2019s motion for preliminary injunction. Escamilla appealed. We review under the following standards:</p>\n<blockquote id=\"b478-14\">A preliminary injunction is an extraordinary equitable remedy that may be granted only if the plaintiff establishes four elements: (1) a substantial likelihood of success on the merits; (2) a substantial threat that the movant will suffer irreparable injury if the injunction is denied; (3) that the threatened injury outweighs any damage that the injunction might cause the defendant; and (4) that the injunction will not disserve the public interest. These four elements are mixed questions of law and fact. Accordingly, we review the factual findings of the district court only for clear error, but we review its legal conclusions <em>de novo. </em>Likewise, although the ultimate decision whether to grant or deny a preliminary injunction is reviewed only for abuse of discretion, a decision based on erroneous legal principles is reviewed <em>de novo.</em><footnotemark><em>2</em></footnotemark></blockquote>\n<p id=\"b478-15\">The magistrate judge concluded that Escamilla had failed to carry his burden in showing a likelihood of success on the merits of the infringement claim, which requires Escamilla to show: (1) that he possesses a valid mark, and (2) that M2 Tech<page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"451\">*451</page-number>nology\u2019s use of the trademark \u201ccreates a likelihood of confusion as to source, affiliation, or sponsorship.\u201d<footnotemark>3</footnotemark> To determine whether such a likelihood of confusion exists, courts look to the following \u201cdigits of confusion,\u201d though no single factor is dis-positive:</p>\n<blockquote id=\"b479-5\">(1) the type of trademark allegedly infringed,</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b479-6\">(2) the similarity between the two marks,</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b479-7\">(3) the similarity of the products or services,</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b479-8\">(4) the identity of the retail outlets and purchasers,</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b479-9\">(5) the identity of the advertising media used,</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b479-10\">(6) the defendant\u2019s intent, ...</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b479-11\">(7) any evidence of actual confusion[, and]</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b479-12\">(8) the degree of care exercised by potential purchasers.<footnotemark>4</footnotemark></blockquote>\n<p id=\"b479-13\">The magistrate judge found that Escamilla had failed to show any likelihood of confusion for a number of reasons. M2 Software is a small company that is focused almost exclusively on the media field and has little ongoing business, while M2 Technology is a larger company that is focused on national defense projects, primarily supplies to government contractors, and requires personnel with security access. M2 Technology sells no products under the M2 mark but only through third-party manufacturers, and M2 Technology\u2019s services are typically provided through those third party manufacturers or through M2 Technology\u2019s employees with security clearance, all in contrast to M2 Software\u2019s business model. M2 Technology, as a government supplier, is required to register in certain government databases in which M2 Software is not registered.</p>\n<p id=\"b479-17\">For these and other reasons, the magistrate judge found that the businesses occupy very different markets. Just as important, the magistrate judge found that Escamilla had showed no evidence that he suffered damages as a result of M2 Technology\u2019 existence, that he suffered any other harm (e.g., loss of control, loss of goodwill), or that M2 Technology had engaged in any bad faith behavior. From these findings of fact, the magistrate judge concluded that Escamilla had failed to show a probable likelihood of confusion as to the use of the M2 mark; that Escamilla had failed to show any harm (irreparable or otherwise) caused \u25a0 by M2 Technology; that the issuance of an injunction would damage M2 Technology; and that an injunction would not serve the public interest.</p>\n<p id=\"b479-18\">In sum, the magistrate judge \u2014 and thus the district court, by adopting the report and recommendation \u2014 found that Escamilla failed to make any of his required showings under the law to secure a preliminary injunction. We find no clear error in any of the magistrate judge\u2019s findings of facts, nor, under <em>de novo </em>review, any legal error. Accordingly, we cannot say that the district court abused its discretion in denying the motion for preliminary injunction.</p>\n<p id=\"b479-19\">For the reasons set out above, we AFFIRM.</p>\n<footnote label=\"*\">\n<p id=\"b478-11\"> Pursuant to 5th Cir.
