We have jurisdiction under 28 U.S.C. \u00a7 2253. We review a district court\u2019s denial of a habeas corpus petition de novo, <em>see Stanley v. Cullen, </em>633 F.3d 852, 859 (9th Cir.2011), and we affirm.</p>\n<p id=\"b689-21\">Madril contends that the state trial court erred by instructing the jury pursuant to CALJIC No. 2.11.5 that it should not speculate whether another person involved in the crime is being prosecuted. To the extent Madril argues that the instruction was faulty under state law, his claim is not cognizable on federal habeas review. <em>See Estelle v. McGuire, </em>502 U.S. 62, 71-72, 112 S.Ct. 475, 116 L.Ed.2d 385 (1991). Further, the record shows that the instruction did not violate Madril\u2019s federal constitutional rights. When, as here, the trial court also instructs the jury regarding witness credibility and accomplices, \u201cthere is no reasonable likelihood that the jury understood CALJIC No. 2.11.5 to bar consideration of [the witness\u2019s] motives for testifying.\u201d <em>Allen v. Woodford, </em>395 F.3d 979, 996 (9th Cir.2005). Accordingly, the California Court of Appeal\u2019s rejection of this claim was not contrary to, or an unreasonable application of, federal law. <em>See </em>28 U.S.C. \u00a7 2254(d)(1).</p>\n<p id=\"b689-22\">Madril next contends that there was insufficient evidence to support the gang sentencing enhancement under California Penal Code \u00a7 186.22. The California Court of Appeal\u2019s determination that there was sufficient evidence of the \u201cprimary activities\u201d element required for the criminal street gang enhancement was neither contrary to nor an unreasonable application of clearly established federal law, nor based on an unreasonable determination of the facts in light of the evidence presented. <em>See </em>28 U.S.C. \u00a7 2254(d); <em>Jackson v. Virginia, </em>443 U.S. 307, 324, 99 S.Ct. 2781, 61 L.Ed.2d 560 (1979).</p>\n<p id=\"b689-23\">Because Madril\u2019s claims are governed by section 2254(d), he is not entitled to an evidentiary hearing. <em>See Gulbrandson v. </em><page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"662\">*662</page-number><em>Ryan, </em>738 F.3d 976, 993-94 &amp; n. 6 (9th Cir.2013), <em>cert. denied, </em>\u2014 U.S.-, 134 S.Ct. 2823, \u2014 L.Ed.2d -, 2014 WL 1392574 (U.S. June 16, 2014).</p>\n<p id=\"b690-7\">We construe Madril\u2019s additional arguments as a motion to expand the certificate of appealability. So construed, the motion is denied. <em>See </em>9th Cir. R. 22 \u2014 1(e); <em>Hiivala v. Wood, </em>195 F.3d 1098, 1104-05 (9th Cir.1999) (per curiam).</p>\n<p id=\"b690-8\">AFFIRMED.</p>\n<footnote label=\"**\">\n<p id=\"b689-24\"> This disposition is not appropriate for publication and is not precedent except as provided by 9th Cir.
