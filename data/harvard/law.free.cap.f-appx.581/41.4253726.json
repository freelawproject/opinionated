Kagan appeals from a May 27, 2011 judgment entered by the U.S. District Court for the Southern District of New York (Rakoff, <em>J.), </em>which affirmed the decision of the bankruptcy court (Morris, <em>Chief Bankr. J.) </em>staying Kagan\u2019s state court action against the New York Department of Health (\u201cDOH\u201d) brought under New York\u2019s Freedom of Information Law (\u201cFOIL\u201d), N.Y. Pub. Off. Law \u00a7 87. In her state court action, Kagan sought the disclosure of certain public records related to the closure of a Manhattan hospital owned by Debtor-Appellee Saint Vincents Catholic Medical Centers of New York (\u201cSaint Vincents\u201d). The bankruptcy court found that the purpose of Kagan\u2019s action was to investigate claims belonging exclusively to the bankruptcy estate and concluded that the suit was barred by the automatic stay under 11 U.S.C. \u00a7 362(a). In the alternative, the bankruptcy court found that Kagan\u2019s state court suit would interfere with the bankruptcy court\u2019s administration of the estate and, therefore stayed the suit pursuant to its equitable authority under 11 U.S.C. \u00a7 105(a). The district court affirmed. On appeal, Kagan argues that the bankruptcy court\u2019s factual findings were clearly erroneous, that her state court suit does not violate the automatic stay, that the bankruptcy court lacked authority to extend the stay under \u00a7 105(a), and that the bankruptcy court\u2019s orders violate her constitutional rights under the First, Fifth, Tenth, and Fourteenth Amendments. We assume the parties\u2019 familiarity with the underlying facts, procedural history of the case, and issues presented for review.</p>\n<p id=\"b70-18\">\u201cOn appeal from the district court\u2019s review of a bankruptcy decision, we review the bankruptcy court decision independently, accepting its factual findings unless clearly erroneous but reviewing its conclusions of law <em>de novo.\u201d In re Bernard L. Madoff Inv. Sec. LLC, </em>740 F.3d 81, 87 (2d Cir.2014) (quoting <em>In re Baker, </em>604 F.3d 727, 729 (2d Cir.2010)). Where the bankruptcy court possesses equitable authority, \u201cwe review the exercise of that equitable authority only for abuse of discretion.\u201d <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"43\">*43</page-number><em>Adelphia Bus. Solutions, Inc. v. Abnos, </em>482 F.3d 602, 607 (2d Cir.2007).</p>\n<p id=\"b71-5\">On our independent review of the record, we agree with the district court that the bankruptcy court acted within its authority when it stayed Kagan\u2019s state court action pursuant to its equitable powers under \u00a7 105(a). A bankruptcy court has equitable authority under \u00a7 105(a) \u201cto assure the orderly conduct of the reorganization proceedings.\u201d <em>In re Baldwin-United Corp. Litig., </em>765 F.2d 343, 348 (2d Cir. 1985). Here, the bankruptcy court reasonably found that the purpose of the state court action was to investigate causes of action within the bankruptcy court\u2019s exclusive purview. After all, Kagan\u2019s petition initiating the state court action attached an affirmation containing incendiary allegations of fraud, waste, and improper transfers in connection with the operation and closing of the hospital, which were purportedly uncovered as part of an ongoing \u201cinvestigation into the financial practices of St. Vincent\u2019s Hospital.\u201d App. 62. Such claims of fraud, waste, and improper transfers clearly represent property of the bankruptcy estate. <em>See Chartschlaa v. Nationwide Mut. Ins. Co., </em>538 F.3d 116, 122 (2d Cir.2008) (per curiam) (explaining that property of the estate includes \u201ccauses of action owned by the debtor or arising from property of the estate\u201d). Indeed, at the time Kagan commenced her state court action, these same kinds of claims were already the subject of an investigation authorized by the official committee of unsecured creditors. In these circumstances, the bankruptcy court reasonably determined that by placing issues within the bankruptcy court\u2019s exclusive jurisdiction before a state court, Kagan had invited judicial confusion and raised \u201cthe specter of direct impact on the <em>res </em>of the bankrupt estate.\u201d <em>Picard v. Fairfield Greenwich Ltd., </em>762 F.3d 199, 211 (2d Cir.2014) (quoting <em>In re Quigley Co., </em>676 F.3d 45, 58 (2d Cir.2012)). We see no abuse of discretion in the bankruptcy court\u2019s exercise of its equitable authority under \u00a7 105(a).</p>\n<p id=\"b71-7\">Because we affirm the bankruptcy court\u2019s extension of the stay under \u00a7 105(a), we need not address whether Kagan\u2019s state court action violated the automatic stay under \u00a7 362(a). With respect to Kagan\u2019s constitutional claims, which Kagan failed to raise to the bankruptcy court but which the district court rejected on the merits, we reject Kagan\u2019s arguments for substantially the reasons stated by the district court in its well-reasoned opinion and order entered on May 24, 2011.</p>\n<p id=\"b71-8\">Kagan also urges us to vacate the bankruptcy court\u2019s order in light of facts that have arisen in the meantime, including the fact that Saint Vincents has now emerged from bankruptcy. Because these facts were not available to the bankruptcy court when it issued its order, we will not consider them on this appeal. However, notwithstanding our rejection of Kagan\u2019s arguments on appeal, nothing in this order prevents Kagan from returning to the bankruptcy court and filing a motion for the court to lift its previously imposed stay based on changed circumstances. The bankruptcy court in its discretion may then consider such a request and the relevance of any changed circumstances in the first instance.</p>\n<p id=\"b71-9\">We have considered all of the appellant\u2019s remaining arguments and find them to be without merit. Accordingly, for the foregoing reasons, the judgment of the district court is AFFIRMED.</p>\n</opinion>\n</casebody>\n",
