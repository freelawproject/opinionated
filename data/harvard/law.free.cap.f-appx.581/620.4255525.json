Pursuant to <em>Anders v. California, </em>386 U.S. 738, 87 S.Ct. 1396, 18 L.Ed.2d 493 (1967), Madera\u2019s counsel has filed a brief stating that there are no grounds for relief, along with a motion to withdraw as counsel of record. We have provided Madera the opportunity to file a pro se supplemental brief. No pro se supplemental brief or answering brief has been filed.</p>\n<p id=\"b648-25\">Madera waived the right to appeal six specified issues related to his sentence. Our independent review of the record pursuant to <em>Penson v. Ohio, </em>488 U.S. 75, 80, 109 S.Ct. 346, 102 L.Ed.2d 300 (1988), discloses no arguable grounds for relief as to any sentencing issue outside the scope of the appeal waiver. We therefore affirm as to those issues. We dismiss the remainder of the appeal in light of the valid <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"621\">*621</page-number>appeal waiver. <em>See United States v. Watson, </em>582 F.3d 974, 988 (9th Cir.2009).</p>\n<p id=\"b649-5\">Counsel\u2019s motion to withdraw is GRANTED.</p>\n<p id=\"b649-6\">AFFIRMED in part; DISMISSED in part.</p>\n<footnote label=\"**\">\n<p id=\"b648-26\"> This disposition is not appropriate for publication and is not precedent except as provided by 9th Cir.
