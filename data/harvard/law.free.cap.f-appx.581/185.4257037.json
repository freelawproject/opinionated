(\u201cUPS\u201d), on her claims of race, gender, and age discrimination under Title VII of the Civil Rights Act of 1964, as amended (\u201cTitle VII\u201d), 42 U.S.C. \u00a7\u00a7 2000e to 2000e-17 (2012), and the Age Discrimination in Employment Act of 1967, as amended (\u201cADEA\u201d), 29 U.S.C. \u00a7\u00a7 621 to 634 (2012). The district court also granted summary judgment to UPS on Shipman\u2019s claims that UPS retaliated against her and fostered a hostile work environment. We affirm.</p>\n<p id=\"b214-18\">We review de novo a district court\u2019s order granting summary judgment. <em>Bonds v. Leavitt, </em>629 F.3d 369, 380 (4th Cir.2011). Summary judgment is appropriate where \u201cthere is no genuine dispute as to any material fact and the movant is entitled to judgment as a matter of law.\u201d Fed.R.Civ.P. 56(a). \u201cAt the summary judgment stage, facts must be viewed in the light most favorable to the nonmoving party only if there is a genuine dispute as <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"187\">*187</page-number>to those facts.\u201d <em>Scott v. Harris, </em>550 U.S. 372, 380, 127 S.Ct. 1769, 167 L.Ed.2d 686 (2007) (internal quotation marks omitted). A district court should grant summary-judgment unless a reasonable jury could return a verdict for the nonmoving party on the evidence presented. <em>Anderson v. Liberty Lobby, Inc., </em>477 U.S. 242, 249, 106 S.Ct. 2505, 91 L.Ed.2d 202 (1986). \u201cConclusory or speculative allegations do not suffice, nor does a mere scintilla of evidence in support of [the nonmoving party\u2019s] case.\u201d <em>Thompson v. Potomac Elec. Power Co., </em>312 F.3d 645, 649 (4th Cir.2002) (internal quotation marks omitted).</p>\n<p id=\"b215-5\">First, Shipman contests the district court\u2019s determination that she failed to exhaust her administrative remedies with respect to her claims of retaliation and hostile work environment. However, because Shipman\u2019s charge filed with the Equal Employment Opportunity Commission (\u201cEEOC\u201d) described only a single act of age, race, and sex discrimination, we conclude that the district court was correct. <em>See Jones v. Calvert Group, Ltd., </em>551 F.3d 297, 300-01 (4th Cir.2009); <em>Chacko v. Patuxent Inst., </em>429 F.3d 505, 508-09 (4th Cir.2005).</p>\n<p id=\"b215-6\">Also without merit is Shipman\u2019s suggestion that the district court erred in finding her claims of discriminatory treatment untimely to the extent they were based on disciplinary terminations Ship-man experienced in March and August 2011. Shipman\u2019s reliance on the continuing violation theory is misplaced because her disparate treatment claims depended on three discrete acts of allegedly discriminatory discipline. <em>Holland v. Wash. Homes, Inc., </em>487 F.3d 208, 219-20 (4th Cir.2007); <em>see also Nat\u2019l R.R. Passenger Corp. v. Morgan, </em>536 U.S. 101, 113-14, 122 S.Ct. 2061, 153 L.Ed.2d 106 (2002).</p>\n<p id=\"b215-7\">Finally, we reject Shipman\u2019s contention that she was entitled to proceed to trial on her claim that her final discharge in January 2012 was discriminatory. Because Shipman produced no direct evidence that discrimination of any type motivated her final termination, the district court properly considered her claims under the burden-shifting framework established in <em>McDonnell Douglas Corp. v. Green, </em>411 U.S. 792, 802-05, 93 S.Ct. 1817, 36 L.Ed.2d 668 (1973). <em>Hill v. Lockheed Martin Logistics Mgmt., Inc., </em>354 F.3d 277, 284-85 (4th Cir.2004) (en banc) (discussing framework); <em>see also Reeves v. Sanderson Plumbing Prods., Inc., </em>530 U.S. 133, 142-49, 120 S.Ct. 2097, 147 L.Ed.2d 105 (2000); <em>Mereish v. Walker, </em>359 F.3d 330, 334 (4th Cir.2004).</p>\n<p id=\"b215-9\">Assuming here, as the district court did, that Shipman established a prima facie case, we agree that the evidence was insufficient to suggest pretext in UPS\u2019s stated reasons for Shipman\u2019s January 2012 discharge \u2014 namely dishonesty, falsification of records, and overall performance. Ship-man\u2019s vague recounting of her brief conversations with several co-workers did not adequately indicate that UPS had cited them for immediately terminable misconduct comparable to that precipitating Ship-man\u2019s final discharge. <em>See Hill v. Michelin N. Am., Inc., </em>252 F.3d 307, 314-15 &amp; n. 3 (4th Cir.2001). Moreover, standing alone, the fact that a grievance panel later concluded that dishonesty should not have been a basis for Shipman\u2019s discharge does not suggest pretext. <em>See DeJarnette v. Corning Inc., </em>133 F.3d 293, 298-99 (4th Cir.1998). Similarly, Shipman\u2019s brief allusion to evidence that she, at times, had disputes with or was mistreated by her various supervisors is unavailing, as such incidents are not generally probative of discrimination. <em>See Love-Lane v. Martin, </em>355 F.3d 766, 788-89 (4th Cir.2004).</p>\n<p id=\"b215-10\">Accordingly, we affirm the judgment of the district court. We dispense with oral <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"188\">*188</page-number>argument because the facts and legal contentions are adequately presented in the materials before this court and argument would not aid the decisional process.</p>\n<p id=\"b216-4\">\n<em>AFFIRMED.</em>\n</p>\n</opinion>\n</casebody>\n",
