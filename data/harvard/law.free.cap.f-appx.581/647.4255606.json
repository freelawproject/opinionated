We have jurisdiction pursuant to 8 U.S.C. \u00a7 1252. Because the BIA conducted a <em>de novo </em>review rather than expressly adopting the IJ\u2019s decision as its own, we review only the BIA\u2019s decision. <em>Simeonov v. Ashcroft, </em>371 F.3d 532, 535 (9th Cir.2004). Reviewing for abuse of discretion, <em>Malty v. Ashcroft, </em>381 F.3d 942, 945 (9th Cir.2004), we deny in part and grant in part the petition for review, and remand for further proceedings.<footnotemark>1</footnotemark></p>\n<p id=\"b676-6\">First, we reject Bernabe\u2019s contention that the BIA applied the incorrect legal standard when determining whether he presented a material change in country conditions in Guatemala sufficient to warrant an exception to the ninety-day time limit applicable to motions to reopen. 8 U.S.C. \u00a7 1229a(c)(7)(C)(i)-(ii) (requiring that a petitioner show a material change in country conditions, and that such evidence was not available or could not have been discovered or presented at the previous hearing to file a motion to reopen after the ninety-day time limit). Bernabe contends that <em>Malty, </em>cited in the BIA\u2019s opinion, is inapposite because he is alleging a new source of persecution rather than a continuance of circumstances. However, the standard set forth in <em>Malty </em>is not limited to cases wherein a petitioner produces evidence of persecution that was related to the initial claim. Instead, \u201c[i]n <em>Malty v. Ashcroft, </em>we held that in order for evidence to be \u2018material,\u2019 \u2018not available,\u2019 and not able to have \u2018been discovered or presented at the previous hearing,\u2019 it must be \u2018qualitatively different\u2019 from the evidence presented at the previous hearing.\u201d <em>Najmabadi v. Holder, </em>597 F.3d 983, 987 (9th Cir.2010) (quoting <em>Malty, </em>381 F.3d at 945-46). This standard applies equally to allegations of new persecution or to a continuance of circumstances. Therefore, the BIA applied the correct legal standard.</p>\n<p id=\"b676-10\">However, the BIA abused its discretion by failing to provide a reasoned explanation for finding that the 2005 and 2009 State Department reports did not support Bernabe\u2019s contentions. Bernabe\u2019s motion to reopen was based on incidents of forced eviction of indigenous Mayans, criminalized social protests, and violence arising out of conflict over the development and resource extraction of land occupied by the indigenous Mayan people. The BIA, however, never addressed or even acknowledged any of these contentions. Instead, the BIA opinion merely block quoted generalized statements from the 2005 and 2009 State Department reports regarding indigenous peoples\u2019 underrepresentation in politics, limited educational opportunities, poverty, and experience of pervasive discrimination \u2014 none of which equated to Bernabe\u2019s actual allegations. Therefore, the BIA abused its discretion because it never squarely addressed Bernabe\u2019s contentions, i.e., that conditions in Guatemala had materially changed since 2005 as a <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"649\">*649</page-number>result of forced evictions and the persecution of indigenous Mayans surrounding anti-raining social protest. <em>See, e.g., Bhasin v. Gonzales, </em>428 F.3d 977, 983 (9th Cir.2005) (\u201c[T]he Board must show proper consideration of all factors, both favorable and unfavorable, in determining whether to grant a motion to reopen, and must articulate its reasons for denying such a motion.\u201d (internal citation omitted)); <em>Sagaydak v. Gonzales, </em>405 F.3d 1035, 1040 (9th Cir.2005) (\u201cWe think it goes without saying that IJs and the BIA are not free to ignore arguments raised by a petitioner.\u201d).</p>\n<p id=\"b677-5\">Moreover, some of the evidence submitted by Bernabe post-dated the 2009 State Department report. Therefore, although Bernabe has not rebutted the presumption that the BIA considered all the evidence, the BIA abused its discretion when it failed to analyze the <em>content </em>of the evidence, especially because the 2009 State Department report described incidents similar to incidents included in Bernabe\u2019s evidence. <em>See Movsisian v. Ashcroft, </em>395 F.3d 1095, 1098 (9th Cir.2005) (stating that it is well settled \u201cthat the BIA abuses its discretion when it fails to provide a reasoned explanation for its actions\u201d); <em>Laritar-Martinez v. INS, </em>220 F.3d 1092, 1095-96 (9th Cir.2000) (finding that a petitioner attempting to establish that the Board violated his due process rights by failing to consider relevant evidence must overcome the presumption that the Board did review all the evidence).</p>\n<p id=\"b677-6\">Finally, the BIA\u2019s citation to the IJ\u2019s decision did not incorporate the IJ\u2019s materiality finding. The BIA cited to and agreed with the IJ\u2019s decision <em>only </em>as to whether conditions in Guatemala had changed sufficiently to reopen proceedings, an issue it reviewed <em>de novo.</em></p>\n<p id=\"b677-9\">Accordingly, we grant in part and deny in part the petition for review. We express no opinion on the merits of Bernabe\u2019s motion. Rather, we remand the petition to the BIA for it to consider Bernabe\u2019s argument and evidence, and to provide a reasoned explanation of its decision. Costs on appeal are awarded to petitioner. <em>See </em>Fed. R.App. P. 39(a)(4).</p>\n<p id=\"b677-10\">PETITION FOR REVIEW DENIED IN PART; GRANTED AND REMANDED IN PART.</p>\n<footnote label=\"**\">\n<p id=\"b676-8\"> This disposition is not appropriate for publication and is not precedent except as provided by 9th Cir.
