We have jurisdiction under 28 U.S.C. \u00a7 1291, and we affirm.</p>\n<p id=\"b664-6\">Valenzuela-Ramirez contends that the government refused to move for a third-level reduction for acceptance of responsibility under U.S.S.G. \u00a7 3El.l(b) on the improper basis that he would not waive his appellate rights. A defendant who challenges the government\u2019s refusal to move for a third point for acceptance of responsibility must show that the government\u2019s refusal was based on an unconstitutional motive or was arbitrary. <em>See United States v. Espinoza-Cano, </em>456 F.3d 1126, 1136 (9th Cir.2006).</p>\n<p id=\"b664-7\">The sole reason the government proffered in the district court for its refusal to move for the third point was the \u201crelatively substantial work\u201d it had done in preparation for trial. The government \u201cis in the best position to (1) know what <em>it </em>has and has not done in relation to trial preparation, and (2) assess whether the defendant\u2019s notification of an intent to plead guilty has assisted the government in avoiding trial preparation.\u201d <em>Id. </em>There is nothing in the record to support Valenzuela-Ramirez\u2019s suggestion that the government misrepresented its trial preparation efforts or that it had a different motivation for declining to file the motion for the third point than the one it offered. We, therefore, affirm.</p>\n<p id=\"b664-10\">AFFIRMED.</p>\n<footnote label=\"***\">\n<p id=\"b664-8\"> This disposition is not appropriate for publication and is not precedent except as provided by 9th Cir.
