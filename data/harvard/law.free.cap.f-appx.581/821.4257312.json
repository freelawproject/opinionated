Mr. Arreola appeals, arguing that the 10-year period of supervised release was substantively unreasonable. We affirm.</p>\n<p id=\"b849-17\">Mr. Arreola did not object to the 10-year term of supervised release in the district court, so we review only for plain error. <em>See, e.g., United States v. Hoffman, </em>710 F.3d 1228, 1231 (11th Cir.2013). Under that standard, there is no reversible error. First, the district court stated that it had considered the statutory factors, and its downward variance of one day with respect to imprisonment indicates that it did take Mr. Arreola\u2019s specific circumstances into account. Second, the advisory guidelines range for supervised release was 5 years to life, and the 10-year term was toward the lower end of that range. Third, nothing in the record indicates that the district court gave too much weight to the advisory guidelines range. Fourth, a 10-year period of supervised release was reasonable given Mr. Arreola\u2019s planned travel between Guatemala and Florida.</p>\n<p id=\"b849-19\">Affirmed.</p>\n</opinion>\n</casebody>\n",
