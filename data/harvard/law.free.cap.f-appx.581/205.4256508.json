On appeal, Silva challenges the reasonableness of his sentence. We affirm.</p>\n<p id=\"b233-20\">We review a sentence for reasonableness, using \u201can abuse-of-discretion standard.\u201d <em>Gall v. United States, </em>552 U.S. 38, 51, 128 S.Ct. 586, 169 L.Ed.2d 445 (2007). We must first review for \u201csignificant procedural error[s],\u201d including, among other things, improperly calculating the Guidelines range. <em>Id. </em>Only if we find a sentence procedurally reasonable may we consider its substantive reasonableness. <em>Id.</em></p>\n<p id=\"b233-21\">Silva first argues that his sentence is procedurally unreasonable because the district court failed to provide notice of its decision to upwardly depart, as required by Fed.R.Crim.P. 32(h). Because Silva raised no relevant objection in the district court, our review of the issue is for plain error. <em>See </em>Fed.R.Crim.P. 52(b); <em>Henderson v. United States, </em>\u2014 U.S. -, 133 S.Ct. 1121, 1126-27, 185 L.Ed.2d 85 (2013) (discussing standard). Even if the district court failed to comply with Rule 32(h)\u2019s notice requirement, however, Silva fails to show that this failure affected his substantial rights. <em>See United States v. McClung, </em>483 F.3d 273, 276 (4th Cir. 2007) (holding that failure to give Rule 32(h) notice is plain error, but defendant failed to show error\u2019s effect on substantial rights).</p>\n<p id=\"b233-24\">A sentencing error affects a defendant\u2019s substantial rights where, \u201cabsent the error, a different sentence might have been imposed.\u201d <em>United States v. Hernandez, </em>603 F.3d 267, 273 (4th Cir.2010). In this case, the district court explicitly stated that it would impose the identical sentence in the absence of the upward departure, <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"206\">*206</page-number>and Silva has failed to identify anything \u201cnew or additional\u201d that he would have presented to the district court had he been afforded adequate notice under Rule 32(h). <em>McClung, </em>483 F.3d at 277. Therefore, Silva is entitled to no relief on this claim.</p>\n<p id=\"b234-4\">Silva next contends that the district court failed to properly apply the upward departure authorized under <em>U.S. Sentencing Guidelines Manual </em>(\u201cUSSG\u201d) \u00a7 5K2.1, p.s. (2012), by failing to adequately consider the factors set forth therein. But the record reflects that the district court did explicitly consider the \u00a7 5K2.1 factors, specifically discussing Silva\u2019s preparation, state of mind, and other relevant factors. Therefore, this claim is unavailing.</p>\n<p id=\"b234-5\">Finally, Silva argues that his sentence is substantively unreasonable. Regardless of whether a district court varies or departs to a sentence above the Guidelines range, we review the substantive reasonableness of an above-Guidelines sentence with regard to \u201cwhether the [district [j]udge abused his discretion in determining that the \u00a7 3553(a) factors supported [the] sentence ... and justified [the] deviation from the Guidelines range.\u201d <em>Gall, </em>552 U.S. at 56, 128 S.Ct. 586. In doing so, we \u201ctake into account the totality of the circumstances, including the extent\u201d of the deviation. <em>Id. </em>at 51,128 S.Ct. 586.</p>\n<p id=\"b234-6\">Here, in support of the sentence, the district court focused on the nature and circumstances of Silva\u2019s offense, the need to provide adequate deterrence, and Silva\u2019s personal history and characteristics. Moreover, the court considered Silva\u2019s claim of self-defense, but determined that Silva\u2019s decision to bring a firearm to a drug deal evidenced his willingness to use it, resulting in Silva shooting and killing a prospective drug buyer who tried to rob him. Therefore, Silva fails to show that his sentence is substantively unreasonable. <em>See United States v. Rivera-Santana, </em>668 F.3d 95, 106 (4th Cir.2012) (\u201cThat a variance sentence deviates significantly from the advisory Guidelines range ... does not alone render it presumptively unreasonable.\u201d); <em>see also United States v. Diosdado-Star, </em>630 F.3d 359, 367 (4th Cir.2011) (affirming sentence seventy-two months above Guidelines range where court properly explained its decision pursuant to \u00a7 3553(a) factors).</p>\n<p id=\"b234-8\">Accordingly, we affirm the district court\u2019s judgment. We dispense with oral argument because the facts and legal contentions are adequately presented in the materials before this court and argument would not aid the decisional process.</p>\n<p id=\"b234-9\">\n<em>AFFIRMED.</em>\n</p>\n</opinion>\n</casebody>\n",
