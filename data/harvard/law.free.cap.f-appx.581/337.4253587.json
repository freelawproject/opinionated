California, </em>386 U.S. 738, 87 S.Ct. 1396, 18 L.Ed.2d 493 (1967), and <em>United States v. Flores, </em>632 F.3d 229 (5th Cir.2011). RicoElizondo filed a letter, which was construed as a motion for an extension of time to file a response. The court gave RicoElizondo a deadline of April 23, 2014 to file his response to the <em>Anders </em>brief. No response was filed. We have reviewed counsel\u2019s brief and the relevant portions of the record reflected therein, as well as RicoElizondo\u2019s letter. We concur with counsel\u2019s assessment that the appeal presents no nonfrivolous issue for appellate review. Accordingly, counsel\u2019s motion for leave to withdraw is GRANTED, counsel is excused from further responsibilities herein, and the APPEAL IS DISMISSED. See 5th Cir. R. 42.2.</p>\n<footnote label=\"*\">\n<p id=\"b366-8\"> Pursuant to 5th Cir. R. 47.5, the court has determined that this opinion should not be published and is not precedent except under the limited circumstances set forth in 5th Cir. R. 47.5.4.</p>\n</footnote>\n</opinion>\n</casebody>\n",
