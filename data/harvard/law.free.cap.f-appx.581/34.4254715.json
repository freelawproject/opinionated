Giusti appeals from the March 12, 2014 order of the United States District Court for the Southern District of New York (Cote, <em>J.), </em>dismissing for lack of subject matter jurisdiction his petition to vacate an arbitration award by the Financial Industry Regulation Authority (\u201cFIN-RA\u201d). On December 9, 2013, the arbitration panel issued an award against Giusti on Morgan Stanley\u2019s claims for breach of contract arising out of Giusti\u2019s alleged failure to pay the balance on a promissory note. On March 3, 2014, Giusti filed the present petition in the district court, seeking vacatur of the award on the grounds of arbiter misconduct. We assume the parties\u2019 familiarity with the underlying facts, procedural history, and specification of issues for review.</p>\n<p id=\"b62-20\">Giusti asserts that the district court had subject matter jurisdiction over his petition to vacate pursuant to Section 10 of the Federal Arbitration Act (\u201cFAA\u201d). 9 U.S.C. \u00a7 10. It is well settled that the FAA \u201cbestows no federal jurisdiction but rather requires for access to a federal forum an independent jurisdictional basis <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"35\">*35</page-number>over the parties\u2019 dispute.\u201d <em>Vaden v. Discover Bank, </em>556 U.S. 49, 59, 129 S.Ct. 1262, 173 L.Ed.2d 206 (2009) (internal quotation marks and alterations omitted) (quoting <em>Hall Street Assocs., L.L.C. v. Mattel, Inc., </em>552 U.S. 576, 581-582, 128 S.Ct. 1396, 170 L.Ed.2d 254 (2008)).</p>\n<p id=\"b63-5\">The district court correctly concluded that Giusti failed to supply an independent basis for federal jurisdiction. First, both parties concede that diversity jurisdiction is absent because the petitioner is a resident of New York and Morgan Stanley is headquartered in New York. 28 U.S.C. \u00a7 1332(a), (c). Second, Giusti\u2019s motion to vacate \u201cdoes not present a question arising under the Constitution, laws or treaties of the United States.\u201d <em>United States v. Am. Soc\u2019y of Composers, Authors &amp; Publishers, </em>32 F.3d 727, 731 (2d Cir.1994); 28 U.S.C. \u00a7 1331. Federal courts may \u201clook through\u201d a petition to vacate an arbitration award to assess whether, \u201csave for the arbitration agreement,\u201d the court would have jurisdiction over \u201cthe substantive controversy between the parties.\u201d <em>Vaden, </em>556 U.S. at 53, 129 S.Ct. 1262 (alterations omitted). Here, the underlying dispute was contractual in nature. Likewise, Giusti\u2019s petition to vacate merely alleges procedural and evidentiary errors, but does not claim that the panel acted in \u201cmanifest disregard of <em>federal </em>law.\u201d <em>Cf. Greenberg v. Bear, Stearns &amp; Co., </em>220 F.3d 22, 25 (2d Cir.2000) (emphasis added). Giusti therefore failed to establish that his right to relief \u201cnecessarily depends on resolution of a substantial question of federal law.\u201d <em>Id. </em>(internal quotation marks omitted). Accordingly, the district court properly dismissed the petition <em>sua sponte. See Durant, Nichols, Houston, Hodgson &amp; Cortese-Costa P.C. v. Dupont, </em>565 F.3d 56, 62 (2d Cir.2009) (\u201cIf subject matter jurisdiction is lacking and no party has called the matter to the court\u2019s attention, the court has the duty to dismiss the action sua sponte.\u201d).</p>\n<p id=\"b63-7\">Giusti requests that, in the event we find subject matter jurisdiction lacking, we transfer his case to state court pursuant to 28 U.S.C. \u00a7 1631. This we cannot do. Section 1631 authorizes a federal court in which a case has been improperly filed to transfer the case to another federal court in which the action or appeal could have been brought. It does not, however, provide for the transfer of an action to state court. <em>McLaughlin v. Arco Polymers, Inc., </em>721 F.2d 426, 428-29 (3d Cir.1983). Specifically, Section 1631 authorizes the transfer of an action \u201cfiled in a court <em>as defined in section 610 </em>of this title or an appeal ... to any other <em>such court </em>in which the action or appeal could have been brought at the time .... \u201d 28 U.S.C. \u00a7 1631 (emphasis added). Because Section 610 enumerates only federal courts, 28 U.S.C. \u00a7 610, we lack the authority to transfer Giusti\u2019s petition to a New York court. <em>See Whitman v. Boats By George, Inc., </em>No. 91-CV-792, 1992 WL 57162, at *4 (N.D.N.Y. Mar. 16,1992).</p>\n<p id=\"b63-8\">Accordingly, appellant\u2019s motion for transfer is DENIED and the order of dismissal of the district court is hereby AFFIRMED.</p>\n</opinion>\n</casebody>\n",
