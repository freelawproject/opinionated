Because the facts and procedural history are familiar to the parties, we do not recite them here except as necessary to explain our disposition. We have jurisdiction under 28 U.S.C. \u00a7\u00a7 2253(a) and 1291. We vacate the district court\u2019s dismissal of Clark\u2019s habeas petition and remand.</p>\n<p id=\"b683-15\">1. We agree with the district court\u2019s conclusion that Clark\u2019s federal habeas petition was untimely filed. Under the Antiterrorism and Effective Death Penalty Act of 1996 (\u201cAEDPA\u201d), a state prisoner generally must file a federal habeas petition within one year of the date his conviction became final. 28 U.S.C. \u00a7 2244(d)(1). (Clark\u2019s conviction became final on September 12, 2006.) Statutory tolling, however, applies throughout the \u201ctime during which a properly filed application for State post-conviction or other collateral review ... is pending.\u201d \u00a7 2244(d)(2). California has no set deadline for filing state habeas petitions, so long as they are \u201cfiled within a reasonable time.\u201d <em>Banjo v. Ayers, </em>614 F.3d 964, 968 (9th Cir.2010) (internal quotation marks and citation omitted). The Ninth Circuit has stated that thirty to sixty days is a \u201cbenchmark for California\u2019s reasonable time requirement.\u201d <em>Velasquez v. Kirkland, </em>639 F.3d 964, 968 (9th Cir.2011) (internal quotation marks omitted).</p>\n<p id=\"b683-16\">Here, the six month delay between the January 11, 2007 state habeas evidentiary hearing and July 23, 2007, when Monroe Thomas (\u201cThomas\u201d) signed a second declaration concerning his trial testimony, could be reasonable because Clark and his wife were \u201cconducting an <em>ongoing investigation </em><page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"656\">*656</page-number>into at least one potentially meritorious claim\u201d with Thomas, a hesitant key witness. <em>In re Robbins, </em>18 Cal.4th 770, 780, 77 Cal.Rptr.2d 153, 959 P.2d 311 (1998) (emphasis in original). It is unclear why Clark waited, without explanation, for another seven months before filing his February 20, 2008 habeas petition with the San Bernardino County Superior Court. Although a delay that exceeds the \u201cbenchmark period\u201d is \u201coccasionally permitted upon a showing of good cause under California law, [Clark] has failed to demonstrate good cause for the delay in this case.\u201d <em>Stewart v. Cate, </em>757 F.3d 929, 937, 2014 WL 1707033, at *5 (9th Cir. May 1, 2014).</p>\n<p id=\"b684-4\">Furthermore, Clark is not entitled to equitable tolling. His multiple appeals and habeas petitions demonstrate that \u201che has been pursuing his rights diligently,\u201d but he provides no explanation of an \u201cextraordinary circumstance [that] stood in his way\u201d and prevented him from filing his federal habeas petition on time. <em>Holland v. Florida, </em>560 U.S. 631, 649, 130 S.Ct. 2549, 177 L.Ed.2d 130 (2010) (quoting <em>Pace v. DiGuglielmo, </em>544 U.S. 408, 418, 125 S.Ct. 1807, 161 L.Ed.2d 669 (2005)).</p>\n<p id=\"b684-5\">2. Although Clark\u2019s federal habeas petition is untimely, we nonetheless remand for an evidentiary hearing, because Clark might well \u201cfall within the narrow class of cases implicating a fundamental miscarriage of justice.\u201d <em>Majoy v. Roe, </em>296 F.3d 770, 776 (9th Cir.2002); <em>see also Johnson v. Knowles, </em>541 F.3d 933, 937 (9th Cir.2008). Under <em>Schlup v. Delo, </em>where a petitioner \u201cpresents evidence of innocence so strong that a court cannot have confidence in the outcome of the trial unless the court is also satisfied that the trial was free of nonharmless constitutional error,\u201d the court may consider an untimely petition on the merits. 513 U.S. 298, 316, 115 S.Ct. 851, 130 L.Ed.2d 808 (1995). \u201c[A] credible claim of actual innocence constitutes an equitable exception to AEDPA\u2019s one-year limitations period, and a petitioner who makes such a showing may pass through the <em>Schlup </em>gateway----\u201d <em>Lee v. Lampert, </em>653 F.3d 929, 932 (9th Cir.2011) (en banc); <em>see also McQuiggin v. Perkins, </em>- U.S. -, 133 S.Ct. 1924, 1928, 185 L.Ed.2d 1019 (2013).</p>\n<p id=\"b684-12\">Here, the district court acted without the benefit of <em>McQuiggin v. Perkins, </em>and thus could not have evaluated whether Clark made a sufficient showing of actual innocence under that case. <em>See </em>\u2014 U.S. -, 133 S.Ct. 1924, 185 L.Ed.2d 1019 (2013) (holding that a credible showing of actual innocence excuses a procedural default under AEDPA).</p>\n<p id=\"b684-15\">\u201c[Clark] has alleged newly discovered evidence that, if credible, raises a sufficient doubt about his guilt, such that it is more likely than not that no reasonable juror would have found him guilty.\u201d <em>Jaramillo v. Stewart, </em>340 F.3d 877, 884 (9th Cir.2003). On September 22, 2005, about a month after Clark was sentenced to fifty-five years to life, Clark\u2019s wife signed a declaration that Thomas recanted to her his trial testimony. On March 3, 2006, Thomas signed his first declaration recanting his trial testimony. And on July 23, 2007, Thomas signed a second declaration recanting his trial testimony and explaining his testimony at the January 11, 2007 state evidentiary hearing.<footnotemark>1</footnotemark></p>\n<p id=\"b685-4\"><page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"657\">*657</page-number>We emphasize that Thomas was the only eye-witness called by the prosecution to testify that Clark was the shooter, because the police received no useful information from anyone at the scene, except for Thomas. Thomas\u2019s multiple recantations of his testimony present a compelling claim of actual innocence. The new evidence in Thomas\u2019s recantations strongly suggests that Thomas committed perjury during the initial trial when he indicated that Clark was responsible for Miguel Rosales\u2019s (\u201cRosales\u201d) murder.</p>\n<p id=\"b685-5\">Thomas\u2019s recantations reveal that another series of events could have led to Rosales\u2019s murder: that Thomas and Rosales stole a floor buffer from the hospital where Rosales worked to sell it for drug and beer money, that two bikers threatened to take the stolen buffer away from Thomas and Rosales, that a biker hit Thomas, that a biker was \u201cwalking around [Rosales] with a weapon,\u201d and that Thomas did not see Clark with a weapon nor did Thomas see Clark shoot Rosales. Thomas\u2019s July 28, 2007 declaration also implicated another possible shooter. And Thomas explicitly disavowed his trial testimony: \u201cI see [Clark] sitting there, doing life in prison for a crime I know he did not commit, all because on three occasions, when I had the chance to tell the truth, I didn\u2019t do it.\u201d Given the critical importance of Thomas\u2019s testimony to the prosecution\u2019s case and the ambiguous corroborating evidence of Rosales\u2019s murder, Clark may well be able to establish that \u201cit is more likely than not that no reasonable juror would have found [Clark] guilty beyond a reasonable doubt.\u201d <em>Schlup, </em>513 U.S. at 327, 115 S.Ct. 851.</p>\n<p id=\"b685-8\">Clark has demonstrated that an evidentiary hearing could reveal information of \u201cmaterial import on his assertion of actual innocence.\u201d <em>Gandarela v. Johnson, </em>286 F.3d 1080, 1087 (9th Cir.2002). An evidentiary hearing would clarify when and why Thomas identified Clark as the assailant, and resolve inconsistencies between Thomas\u2019s various post-trial statements. Because additional testimony from Thomas may substantiate Clark\u2019s actual innocence claim, and entitle Clark to override the AEDPA time limit for filing a habeas claim, we remand for an evidentiary hearing on Clark\u2019s <em>Schlup </em>claim.</p>\n<p id=\"b685-9\">Costs shall be taxed against Respondent-Appellee. Fed. R.App. P. 39(a)(4).</p>\n<p id=\"b685-10\">VACATED and REMANDED.</p>\n<footnote label=\"*\">\n<p id=\"b683-13\"> This disposition is not appropriate for publication and is not precedent except as provided by 9th Cir. R. 36-3.</p>\n</footnote>\n<footnote label=\"1\">\n<p id=\"b684-6\">. There is good reason to discount Thomas's reaffirmation of his trial testimony at the state habeas evidentiary hearing on January 11, 2007, before Judge Krug. Before Thomas was questioned, Judge Krug warned him that if he held to his recantation, Judge Krug would \"direct the district attorney to file a criminal Complaint against you for perjury, a felony,\u201d and that he would be detained and tried. By contrast, Judge Krug told Thomas that he <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"657\">*657</page-number>would \"still be in trouble\" if he testified that his original testimony had been true, because he recanted it in a declaration under penalty of perjury, but did not threaten him with prosecution, arrest, or detention. When Thomas testified that \"it wasn\u2019t Mr. Clark with the nine millimeter weapon,\" Judge Krug interrupted him: \"Listen to me. Listen to me. You cannot worm out of what you said at trial.\u201d When Thomas later stated that he did not lie at trial, Judge Krug said: \"Then, sir, you have saved yourself from a charge of perjury.\" Judge Krug then found Thomas\u2019s reaffirmation of his trial testimony \u2014 once again, as at trial, elicited under threat of criminal sanction \u2014 credible. After the hearing, in a second declaration, Thomas stated that, \u201d[w]hen the judge asked me if I lied at the trial, I should have said yes; ... the judge told me that if I said I lied at the trial, I was going to jail. I couldn\u2019t face that. I have a job now, am on methadone every day, and my life is better than it has ever been. I couldn't see that all go away, so I told the judge that I told the truth at trial; But, what I said on January 11, 2007, was not true.\u201d</p>\n</footnote>\n</opinion>\n</casebody>\n",
