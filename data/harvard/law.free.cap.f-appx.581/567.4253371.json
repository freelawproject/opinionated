The search uncovered a cache of property stolen from local storage units, and Kelly was convicted in state court on multiple counts of burglary. He contends in this suit under 42 U.S.C. \u00a7 1983 that Hocking violated the Fourth Amendment. This action is proper, notwithstanding <em>Heck v. Humphrey, </em>512 U.S. 477, 114 S.Ct. 2364, 129 L.Ed.2d 383 (1994), because contentions that police violated the Fourth Amendment during an investigation do not necessarily draw a conviction\u2019s validity into question. See <em>Wallace v. Kato, </em>549 U.S. 384, 127 S.Ct. 1091, 166 L.Ed.2d 973 (2007).</p>\n<p id=\"b596-7\">Kelly maintains that Hocking violated the Fourth Amendment by participating in the execution of a warrant that was not supported by probable cause and by seizing items that, Kelly insists, were not described by the warrant. The district court\u2019s opinion demonstrates that neither of these contentions is correct.</p>\n<p id=\"b596-8\">More than that: neither the warrant nor probable cause was necessary for this search. Kelly agreed to terms of supervised release under which he consented in advance to a search of his home. Such consents are valid, see <em>Samson v. California, </em>547 U.S. 843, 126 S.Ct. 2193, 165 L.Ed.2d 250 (2006), so the police did not need a warrant or probable cause. See also, e.g., <em>United States v. Huart, </em>735 F.3d 972, 975 (7th Cir.2013); <em>People v. Wilson, 228 </em>Ill.2d 35, 43-52, 319 Ill.Dee. 353, 885 N.E.2d 1033 (2008) (demonstrating that the Illinois system of \u201cmandatory supervised release\u201d is functionally the same as California\u2019s system of parole discussed in Samson).</p>\n<p id=\"b596-14\">Kelly\u2019s remaining arguments have been considered but do not require discussion.</p>\n<p id=\"b596-15\">Affirmed</p>\n</opinion>\n</casebody>\n",
