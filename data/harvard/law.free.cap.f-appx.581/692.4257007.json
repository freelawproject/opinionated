We have jurisdiction under 8 U.S.C. \u00a7 1252. We review for abuse of discretion the BIA\u2019s denial of a motion to reopen. <em>Bhasin v. Gonzales, </em>423 F.3d 977, 983 (9th Cir.2005). Buldakov\u2019s petition is denied on the ground that Buldakov has failed to establish changed circumstances that would exempt his motion from the applicable time limitation.</p>\n<p id=\"b720-22\">The parties are familiar with the facts, as set forth in the BIA\u2019s decision, so we need not review them here. Section 240(c)(7)(C)(i) of the Immigration and Nationality Act (\u201cAct\u201d), 8 U.S.C. .\u00a7 1229a(c)(7)(C)(i), requires that motions to reopen be filed within 90 days of the final administrative order of removal. Buldakov filed his motion to reopen outside the 90-day window.</p>\n<p id=\"b720-24\">Along with his motion to reopen, Buldakov filed an asylum application seeking an exemption from the 90-day limitation. 8 U.S.C. \u00a7 1229a(c)(7)(C)(ii) specifies that there is no time limit for asylum-seekers moving to reopen if the asylum-seeker can show \u201cchanged country conditions\u201d through material evidence that was unavailable at the previous proceeding.</p>\n<p id=\"b720-25\">We conclude that based on the evidence before it the BIA did not abuse its discretion when it concluded that Buldakov failed to establish changed conditions in Russia. Because Buldakov could not take advantage of the exemption to the 90-day limit, the BIA denied his motion to reopen as untimely. We agree and affirm. PETITION DENIED.</p>\n<footnote label=\"**\">\n<p id=\"b720-27\"> This disposition is not appropriate for publication and is not precedent except as provided by 9th Cir.
