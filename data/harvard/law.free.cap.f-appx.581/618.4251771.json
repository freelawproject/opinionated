Our jurisdiction is governed by 8 U.S.C. \u00a7 1252. We review for abuse of discretion the denial of a motion to reopen. <em>Andia v. Ashcroft, </em>359 F.3d 1181, 1184 (9th Cir. 2004) (per curiam). We deny in part and dismiss in part the petition for review.</p>\n<p id=\"b646-24\">The BIA did not abuse its discretion by denying for lack of prejudice Angamarca Llivicura\u2019s motion to reopen based on a claim of ineffective assistance of counsel. <em>See Montes-Lopez v. Holder, </em>694 F.3d 1085, 1090 (9th Cir.2012) (\u201c[A] petitioner must show prejudice to prevail on a claim [of] ineffective assistance of counsel.... \u201d). As to Angamarca Llivicura\u2019s first prior attorney, the BIA\u2019s previous decision reopening removal proceedings based on Angamarca Llivicura\u2019s claim of ineffective assistance of counsel cured any prejudice arising from that attorney\u2019s errors. <em>See Desta v. Ashcroft, </em>365 F.3d 741, 748 (9th Cir.2004) (observing that reopening can \u201ccure\u201d previous defective representation). As to his second prior attorney, Angamarca Llivicura did not explain how any testimony that his siblings were unable to present due to that attorney\u2019s alleged errors <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"619\">*619</page-number>might have altered the agency\u2019s determination that he had failed to demonstrate sufficient hardship to qualify for cancellation of removal. <em>See Mohsseni Behbahani v. INS, </em>796 F.2d 249, 251 (9th Cir.1986) (concluding that the petitioner\u2019s failure to \u201cdescribe the evidence that [his counsel] incompetently failed to introduce\u201d prevented the court from finding prejudice).</p>\n<p id=\"b647-5\">In light of this disposition, we need not evaluate Angamarca Llivicura\u2019s compliance with the procedural requirements for filing an ineffective-assistance claim. <em>See Simeonov v. Ashcroft, </em>371 F.3d 532, 538 (9th Cir .2004).</p>\n<p id=\"b647-6\">Angamarca Llivicura\u2019s assertions regarding hardship lie beyond the scope of our review. <em>See Audia, </em>359 F.3d at 1184 (\u201cIn reviewing the decision of the BIA, we consider only the grounds relied upon by that agency.\u201d).</p>\n<p id=\"b647-7\">PETITION FOR REVIEW DENIED in part; DISMISSED in part.</p>\n<footnote label=\"**\">\n<p id=\"b646-25\"> This disposition is not appropriate for publication and is not precedent except as provided by 9 th Cir.
