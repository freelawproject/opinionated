Our jurisdiction is governed by 8 U.S.C. \u00a7 1252. We review for substantial evidence adverse credibility determinations. <em>Shrestha v. Holder, </em>590 F.3d 1034, 1039 (9th Cir.2010). We dismiss in part and deny in part the petition for review.</p>\n<p id=\"b712-3\"><page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"684\">*684</page-number>We lack jurisdiction to consider Vicente-Simon\u2019s ineffective assistance of counsel claim because Vicente-Simon failed to exhaust the claim in his direct appeal to the BIA. <em>See Barron v. Ashcroft, </em>358 F.3d 674, 677-78 (9th Cir.2004) (court lacks jurisdiction to review claims not raised to the agency); <em>see also Puga v. Chertoff, </em>488 F.3d 812, 815-16 (9th Cir.2007) (indicating that ineffective assistance of counsel claims must be raised in a motion to reopen before the BIA).</p>\n<p id=\"b712-4\">Vicente-Simon\u2019s motion to take judicial notice is denied. <em>See Fisher v. INS, </em>79 F.3d 955, 963-64 (9th Cir.1996) (en banc) (court\u2019s review is limited to the administrative record).</p>\n<p id=\"b712-5\">Substantial evidence supports the agency\u2019s adverse credibility determination based on inconsistencies between Vicente-Simon\u2019s testimony and his supporting documents regarding the injuries he sustained, the reason he was targeted, and whether he saw his father after the second kidnaping. <em>See Shrestha, </em>590 F.3d at 1048 (adverse credibility finding was reasonable under the totality of the circumstances); <em>see also Goel v. Gonzales, </em>490 F.3d 735, 739 (9th Cir.2007). Vicente-Simon\u2019s explanations do not compel a contrary conclusion. <em>See Lata v. INS, </em>204 F.3d 1241, 1245 (9th Cir.2000). In the absence of credible testimony, Vicente-Simon\u2019s asylum and withholding of removal claims fail. <em>Farah v. Ashcroft, </em>348 F.3d 1153, 1156 (9th Cir.2003).</p>\n<p id=\"b712-6\">PETITION FOR REVIEW DISMISSED in part; DENIED in part.</p>\n<footnote label=\"**\">\n<p id=\"b711-24\"> This disposition is not appropriate for publication and is not precedent except as provided by 9th Cir.
