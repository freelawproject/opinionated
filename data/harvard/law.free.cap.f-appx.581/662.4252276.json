Pursuant to <em>Anders v. California, </em>386 U.S. 738, 87 S.Ct. 1396, 18 L.Ed.2d 493 (1967), Aguirre-Rivas\u2019s counsel has filed a brief stating that there are no grounds for relief, along with a motion to withdraw as counsel of record. We have provided Aguirre-Rivas the opportunity to file a pro se supplemental brief. No pro se supplemental brief or answering brief has been filed.</p>\n<p id=\"b690-27\">Aguirre-Rivas has waived his right to appeal his conviction and sentence. Our independent review of the record pursuant to <em>Penson v. Ohio, </em>488 U.S. 75, 80, 109 S.Ct. 346, 102 L.Ed.2d 300 (1988), discloses no arguable issue as to the validity of the waiver. <em>See United States v. Watson, </em>582 F.3d 974, 986-88 (9th Cir.2009). We, accordingly, dismiss the appeal in case number 13-10417. <em>See id. </em>at 988. Because Aguirre-Rivas has fully served the sentence imposed upon revocation of supervised release, we dismiss the appeal in case number 13-10418 as moot. <em>See Spencer v. Kemna, </em>523 U.S. 1, 12-14, 118 S.Ct. 978, 140 L.Ed.2d 43 (1998).</p>\n<p id=\"b691-4\"><page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"663\">*663</page-number>Counsel\u2019s motion to withdraw is GRANTED.</p>\n<p id=\"b691-5\">DISMISSED.</p>\n<footnote label=\"**\">\n<p id=\"b690-28\"> This disposition is not appropriate for publication and is not precedent except as provided by 9th Cir.
