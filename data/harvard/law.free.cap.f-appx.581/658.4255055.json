Substantial evidence supports the BIA\u2019s finding that petitioners don\u2019t qualify for an exception to the one-year filing deadline. <em>See </em>8 U.S.C. \u00a7 1158(a)(2)(B). Petitioners argue that \u201cextraordinary circumstances\u201d excuse their delay because they relied on a fraudulent immigration consulting organization, the Chinese Indonesian Association (CIAS), to file their asylum applications. 8 U.S.C. \u00a7 1158(a)(2)(D); 8 C.F.R. \u00a7 1208.4(a)(5). But, unlike <em>Viridiana v. Holder, </em>646 F.3d 1230, 1238-39 (9th Cir.2011), on which petitioners rely, they didn\u2019t pay the full fee CIAS requested, didn\u2019t demonstrate reasonable diligence and unilaterally stopped working with the organization.</p>\n<p id=\"b686-19\">Even if reliance on CIAS were an extraordinary circumstance, petitioners\u2019 asylum applications weren\u2019t filed \u201cwithin a reasonable period.\u201d 8 C.F.R. \u00a7 1208.4(a)(5). Sie\u2019s application deadline passed almost nine months before she approached CIAS, and the fact that she didn\u2019t know about the possibility of asylum relief is hardly extraordinary. <em>See Antonio-Martinez v. INS, </em>317 F.3d 1089, 1093 (9th Cir.2003). Simamora did contact CIAS two months before his filing due date, but then he didn\u2019t actually file his application until almost four years after he parted ways with the organization. We lack jurisdiction to consider petitioners\u2019 argument that Simamora\u2019s application should be considered to have been filed at the same time as Sie\u2019s because Sie had listed Simamora as a derivative beneficiary. <em>See Barron v. Ashcroft, </em>358 F.3d 674, 677 (9th Cir.2004).</p>\n<p id=\"b686-20\">2. The BIA did not err in holding that petitioners didn\u2019t qualify for withholding of removal. That a group of Muslims prevented Simamora from holding a prayer meeting at his house does not rise to the level of persecution, as neither Simamora\u2019s property nor person were threatened or harmed. <em>See Hoxha v. Ashcroft, </em>319 F.3d 1179, 1182 (9th Cir.2003); <em>Prasad v. INS, </em>47 F.3d 336, 339-40 (9th Cir.1995). Nor was Sie subject to persecution. She testified that in the 1970s, unknown Indonesi<page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"659\">*659</page-number>ans burned down her school and family home. She believed an Indonesian was involved with the drowning of her younger brother in 1996, and that her older brother\u2019s death was caused either by his Indonesian boss or natural causes. Sie also testified that her nephew was robbed by a group of Indonesians in 2003, almost two years after she left the country. Sie provides no proof that any of these misfortunes resulted from her protected status.</p>\n<p id=\"b687-5\">Substantial evidence also supports the BIA\u2019s finding that petitioners failed to establish a \u201cclear probability\u201d of future persecution. <em>See Tampubolon v. Holder, </em>610 F.3d 1056, 1062 (9th Cir.2010). Although petitioners arguably face a general risk of persecution in Indonesia because they are Catholic and Sie is Chinese, they were never specifically targeted or physically injured, and their two adult sons are still living in the country, apparently unharmed. <em>See Hakeem v. INS, </em>273 F.3d 812, 816-17 (9th Cir.2001), <em>superseded in part by statute, </em>REAL ID Act of 2005, Pub.L. No. 109-13, \u00a7 106, 119 Stat. 231.</p>\n<p id=\"b687-6\">3. The BIA\u2019s determination that petitioners are ineligible for protection under the Convention Against Torture is supported by substantial evidence. Petitioners argue that Indonesia\u2019s corrupt law enforcement system and intolerant religious environment are conditions warranting CAT relief. But petitioners haven\u2019t presented any evidence of a \u201cparticularized threat of torture.\u201d <em>See Dhital v. Mukasey, </em>532 F.3d 1044, 1051 (9th Cir.2008) (per curiam) (emphasis omitted).</p>\n<p id=\"b687-7\">PETITION DENIED.</p>\n<footnote label=\"*\">\n<p id=\"b686-17\"> This disposition is not appropriate for publication and is not precedent except as provided by 9th Cir.
