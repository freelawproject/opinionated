Richardson, a veteran who served on active duty from June to August 1935 and again from September 1942 to July 1944, died on September 20, 2012, while his claim for benefits was pending before the Board of Veterans\u2019 Appeals (\u201cthe Board\u201d) on remand. Shortly thereafter \u2014 on September 26, 2012 \u2014 the Board dismissed Mr. Richardson\u2019s case due to his death. llene M. Richardson appealed the Board\u2019s decision to the United States Court of Appeals for Veterans Claims (\u201cVeterans Court\u201d). The Veterans Court ordered counsel to show cause why the appeal of the Board\u2019s decision should not also be dismissed for want of jurisdiction. In response, counsel argued, among other things, that Mrs. Richardson was entitled to be substituted as appellant in place of her deceased husband pursuant to 38 U.S.C. \u00a7 5121A. The Veterans Court dismissed Mrs. Richardson\u2019s appeal for lack of jurisdiction. In its decision, the court cited VA Fast Letter 10-30 dated August 10, 2010, which provided that an eligible survivor may file a request with the agen<page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"902\">*902</page-number>cy of original jurisdiction to be substituted in place of the original claimant. Mrs. Richardson now appeals from the Veterans Court\u2019s dismissal.</p>\n<p id=\"b930-4\">After careful consideration, we agree with the Veterans Court that it lacked jurisdiction over Mrs. Richardson\u2019s appeal. As counsel for the government conceded at oral argument, however, Mrs. Richardson\u2019s timely notice of appeal of the Board\u2019s September 26, 2012 decision qualifies as an informal claim for substitution under \u00a7 5121A which she is entitled to have adjudicated. Oral Argument at 13:25-14:10, available at http://www.cafc.uscourts.gov/ oral-argument-recordings/2013-7144/all (Q: \u201cDo you regard the notice of appeal that Mrs. Richardson filed as an informal claim or motion for substitution?\u201d ... A: \u201cIt\u2019s our position that under <em>Reeves </em>it would be an informal claim.\u201d); <em>see Reeves v. Shinseki, </em>682 F.3d 988, 993 (Fed.Cir. 2012) (\u201cBecause Mrs. Reeves\u2019 motion for substitution clearly evinced an intent to obtain the benefits due and payable to her husband as of the date of his death, it qualifies as an informal claim for accrued benefits.\u201d); <em>see also Kelsey v. West, </em>13 Vet.App. 437, 438 (Vet.App.2000) (stating that a notice of appeal, which contained notice of the veteran\u2019s death, constituted \u201can informal, derivative, claim for accrued benefits, which [the surviving spouse] is entitled to have adjudicated\u201d). Upon adjudication of her request, Mrs. Richardson\u2019s claim or request for substitution may proceed before the Board without loss of priority. Accordingly, we affirm the decision of the Veterans Court dismissing Mrs. Richardson\u2019s appeal.</p>\n<p id=\"b930-5\">AFFIRMED.</p>\n</opinion>\n</casebody>\n",
