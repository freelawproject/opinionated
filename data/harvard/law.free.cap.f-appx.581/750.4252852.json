Wilson argues that because the savings clause of 28 U.S.C. \u00a7 2255(e) applies to his claim, the district court erred in dismissing his \u00a7 2241 habeas petition. After careful review, we affirm.</p>\n<p id=\"b779-18\">The availability of habeas relief under \u00a7 2241 presents a question of law that we review <em>de novo. Cook v. Wiley, </em>208 F.3d 1314, 1317 (11th Cir.2000).</p>\n<p id=\"b779-19\">Typically, collateral attacks on the validity of a federal conviction or sentence must be brought under \u00a7 2255. <em>Sawyer v. Holder, </em>326 F.3d 1363, 1365 (11th Cir. 2003). Challenges to the execution of a sentence, rather than the validity of the sentence itself, are properly brought under \u00a7 2241. <em>Antonelli v. Warden, U.S.P. Atlanta, </em>542 F.3d 1348, 1352 (11th Cir.2008). The \u201csavings clause\u201d of \u00a7 2255, however, permits a federal prisoner, under limited circumstances, to file a habeas petition under \u00a7 2241. 28 U.S.C. \u00a7 2255(e). In order for a district court to entertain a \u00a7 2241 petition attacking custody resulting from a federally imposed sentence, the petitioner must establish that the remedy provided for under \u00a7 2255 is \u201cinadequate or ineffective to test the legality of his detention.\u201d <em>Sawyer, </em>326 F.3d at 1365. Since the savings clause is a jurisdictional provision, a petitioner must make the \u201cin<page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"752\">*752</page-number>adequate or ineffective\u201d showing <em>before </em>the court has jurisdiction to review the \u00a7 2241 petition. <em>Williams v. Warden, Fed. Bureau of Prisons, </em>713 F.3d 1332, 1339-40 (11th Cir.2013), <em>petition for cert, filed, </em>(U.S. April 8, 2014).</p>\n<p id=\"b780-4\">Although the scope of the \u00a7 2255(e) savings clause has not been fully defined, we\u2019ve found that \u00a7 2255\u2019s remedy is not inadequate or ineffective under the savings clause simply due to the restriction that a prisoner who has previously filed an unsuccessful \u00a7 2255 motion to vacate his conviction generally may not file a second or successive \u00a7 2255 motion without our prior authorization. <em>Gilbert v. United States, </em>640 F.3d 1293, 1308 (11th Cir.2011) (en banc) <em>(\u201cGilbert II </em>\u201d). In an early case, we noted that a petitioner meets the requirements of the savings clause when: (1) the petitioner\u2019s claim is based on a retroactively applicable Supreme Court decision; (2) the holding of that Supreme Court decision establishes that the petitioner was convicted of a nonexistent offense; and (3) circuit law squarely foreclosed such a claim at the time it otherwise should have been raised at the petitioner\u2019s trial, on appeal, or in his first \u00a7 2255 motion. <em>Wofford v. Scott, </em>177 F.3d 1236, 1244 (11th Cir.1999). However, we later limited <em>Wofford, </em>saying that its test established necessary, but not sufficient, conditions for a sentencing claim to be viable under \u00a7 2255(e)\u2019s savings clause. <em>Williams, </em>713 F.3d at 1343-44. We\u2019ve also said that \u201c[e]ven if a petitioner succeeds in making Wofford\u2019s three-part showing, he would then need to demonstrate \u2018actual innocence\u2019 of the crime for which he was convicted to demonstrate an entitlement to relief.\u201d <em>Turner v. Warden Coleman FCI, </em>709 F.3d 1328, 1333 n. 2 (11th Cir.2013).</p>\n<p id=\"b780-5\">In <em>Bryant v. Coleman, </em>738 F.3d 1253 (11th Cir.2013), we addressed whether a petitioner can use the savings clause to \u201copen the portal\u201d to \u00a7 2241 where an erroneous application of the ACCA resulted in a sentence that exceeded the statutory maximum sentence. Based on <em>Wofford, Gilbert II, </em>and <em>Williams, </em>we said that a petitioner seeking to establish that his pri- or \u00a7 2255 motion had been \u201cinadequate or ineffective to test the legality of his detention\u201d must make a five-part showing. <em>Bryant, </em>738 F.3d at 1274. He must demonstrate that: (1) throughout his sentencing, on direct appeal, and the first \u00a7 2255 proceeding, our binding precedent had specifically addressed his distinct prior state conviction that triggered \u00a7 924(e) and had squarely foreclosed his \u00a7 924(e) claim that he was erroneously sentenced above the ten-year statutory maximum penalty in \u00a7 924(a); (2) a Supreme Court decision announced after his first \u00a7 2255 proceeding overturned our precedent that had squarely foreclosed his \u00a7 924(e) claim; (3) the Supreme Court\u2019s new rule applies retroactively on collateral review; (4) as a result of the new rule being retroactive, his current sentence exceeds the ten-year statutory maximum authorized in \u00a7 924(a); and (5) the savings clause in \u00a7 2255(e) reaches his pure \u00a7 924(e) error claim of illegal detention above his statutory maximum penalty in \u00a7 924(a). <em>Id.</em></p>\n<p id=\"b780-7\">Under Florida law, \u201cbattery by a detainee\u201d occurs when a person who is being detained in a prison, jail, or other detention facility commits battery upon any visitor to the detention facility or upon any other detainee in the detention center. Fla. Stat. \u00a7 784.082. Battery is defined as actually and intentionally touching or striking another person against the will of the other; or intentionally causing bodily harm to another person. Fla. Stat. \u00a7 784.03. Prior to the Supreme Court\u2019s decision in <em>United States v. Johnson, </em>simple battery under Florida law constituted a violent felony for ACCA purposes. <em>United States v. Johnson, </em>528 F.3d 1318, 1321 <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"753\">*753</page-number>(11th Cir.2008), <em>rev\u2019d, </em>559 U.S. 138, 130 S.Ct. 1265, 176 L.Ed.2d 1 (2010). The Supreme Court concluded in <em>Johnson </em>that where it could not be shown that a defendant convicted of the Florida offense of battery did anything more than actually and intentionally touch the victim, he did not use the physical force required to constitute a violent felony under ACCA. <em>Johnson, </em>559 U.S. at 136-41, 130 S.Ct. 1265. Where a statute includes statutory phrases that require violent force and phrases that do not require violent force, the modified categorical approach allows examination of the charging document, written plea agreement, transcript of plea colloquy, and any explicit factual finding by the trial judge to which the defendant assented to determine which statutory phrase was the basis for the conviction. <em>Id. </em>at 136-37, 130 S.Ct. 1265. Undisputed facts in the PSI can also be relied on for this purpose. <em>United States v. Ramirez-Flores, </em>743 F.3d 816, 820 (11th Cir.2014). We\u2019ve previously accepted the government\u2019s concession that <em>Johnson </em>is retroactively applicable. <em>See Rozier v. United States, </em>701 F.3d 681, 684 (11th Cir.2012).</p>\n<p id=\"b781-5\">In <em>Descamps v. United States, </em>the Supreme Court held that sentencing courts may not apply the modified categorical approach to determine if a conviction is a \u201cviolent felony\u201d under the ACCA when the crime of conviction has a \u201csingle, indivisible set of elements.\u201d <em>See </em>\u2014 U.S.-, 133 S.Ct. 2276, 2281-82, 186 L.Ed.2d 438 (2013). The Supreme Court itself has not expressly declared <em>Descamps </em>to be retroactive to cases on collateral review. Moreover, <em>Descamps </em>was decided in the context of a direct appeal, and the Supreme Court has not since applied it to a case on collateral review. <em>Cf. In re Anderson, </em>396 F.3d 1336, 1339 (11th Cir.2005) (holding that <em>United States v. Booker, </em>543 U.S. 220, 125 S.Ct. 738, 160 L.Ed.2d 621 (2005), was not retroactively applicable in part because the Supreme Court had decided it on direct appeal, and had not applied it to a case on collateral review).</p>\n<p id=\"b781-8\">In this case, Wilson cannot meet the requirements in <em>Bryant </em>to show that the savings clause of 28 U.S.C. \u00a7 2255(e) applied. Among other things, he cannot establish that throughout his sentencing, direct appeal, and first \u00a7 2255 proceeding, binding precedent squarely foreclosed his claim that his prior battery by a detainee conviction did not constitute a violent felony. Indeed, even assuming that <em>Johnson </em>(a simple battery case) foreclosed Wilson\u2019s claim, <em>Johnson </em>was published in 2008, well after Wilson\u2019s 2003 conviction, his appeal, and his first \u00a7 2255 were concluded, and we\u2019ve found no precedent precluding Wilson from arguing at the time of these proceedings that battery on a detainee was not a violent felony. Also too late for Wilson was <em>United States v. Glover, </em>431 F.3d 744 (2005), which involved the Florida crime of battery on a law enforcement officer. Wilson thus cannot meet the first requirement of <em>Bryant </em>and cannot proceed through \u00a7 2241.</p>\n<p id=\"b781-9\">But even if Wilson\u2019s claim could have succeeded in opening the portal to a \u00a7 2241 proceeding, he could not prevail on the merits of his claim. To begin with, the Supreme Court\u2019s decision in <em>Johnson </em>does not indicate that the Florida offense of battery is never a violent felony; rather, it provides that the modified categorical approach should be utilized to determine whether the offense would qualify as a violent felony. <em>Johnson, </em>559 U.S. at 136-37, 144-45, 130 S.Ct. 1265. Here, the facts from Wilson\u2019s PSI, which he did not object to, clearly indicate that his offense, which involved punching another detainee, involv\u00e9d physical force. In addition, breaking the detainee\u2019s nose constituted intent to cause bodily harm. Therefore, Wilson\u2019s <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"754\">*754</page-number>offense constitutes a violent felony, even in light of <em>Johnson. Id.; Ramirez-Flores, </em>743 F.3d at 820.</p>\n<p id=\"b782-4\"><em>Descamps </em>does nothing to alter this conclusion. Under <em>Descamps, </em>the modified categorical approach applies only to divisible statutes. 133 S.Ct. at 2281-82. Florida\u2019s battery statute is divisible because a person may commit battery by engaging in any of three distinct acts. <em>See </em>Fla. Stat. \u00a7 784.03. Because Wilson\u2019s offense constitutes a violent felony even in light of <em>Johnson </em>and <em>Descamps, </em>the ACCA would properly apply, and Wilson\u2019s claim would have no merit. Accordingly, we affirm the district court\u2019s dismissal of Wilson\u2019s \u00a7 2241 petition.</p>\n<p id=\"b782-5\">AFFIRMED.</p>\n</opinion>\n</casebody>\n",
