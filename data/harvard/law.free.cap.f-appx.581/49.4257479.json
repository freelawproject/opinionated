On appeal, Jane Street argues principally that the district court misconstrued the insurance policy at the center of this litigation. We assume the parties\u2019 familiarity with the underlying facts, the procedural history, and the issues presented for review.</p>\n<p id=\"b77-21\">On October 29, 2012, Hurricane Sandy destroyed Jane Street\u2019s $2.2 million generator in the basement of One New York Plaza. Aspen insured Jane Street against flood damage. The dispute is whether the policy insured Jane Street\u2019s property in the basement.</p>\n<p id=\"b77-22\">The policy defined the \u201ccovered location\u201d as Jane Street\u2019s corporate headquarters, specifically: \u201cOne New York Plaza, 33rd Floor, New York N.Y. 10004.\u201d Jane Street submitted a claim, but Aspen refused to pay any more than $50,000 \u2014 the policy\u2019s sublimit for property not in a covered location. Jane Street sued Aspen for breach of contract, breach of fiduciary duty, and bad faith. The district court <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"50\">*50</page-number>granted Aspen\u2019s motion for summary judgment as to all three causes of action, on the ground that the policy covered property only on the 33rd floor and did not extend to the basement where the generator had been located. Jane Street appeals the district court\u2019s judgment with respect to the breach of contract and bad faith claims.</p>\n<p id=\"b78-4\">We review de novo both a district court\u2019s grant of summary judgment, <em>see, e.g., Terwilliger v. Terwilliger, </em>206 F.3d 240, 244 (2d Cir.2000), and its interpretation of a contract, <em>see, e.g., Capital Ventures Int\u2019l v. Republic of Argentina, </em>552 F.3d 289, 293 (2d Cir.2009). Summary judgment is appropriate only \u201cif the movant shows that there is no genuine dispute as to any material fact and the movant is entitled to judgment as a matter of law.\u201d Fed.R.Civ.P. 56(a); <em>see also Celotex Corp. v. Catrett, 477 </em>U.S. 317, 323, 106 S.Ct. 2548, 91 L.Ed.2d 265 (1986).</p>\n<p id=\"b78-5\">The insurance policy defined the covered property as Jane Street\u2019s \u201cbusiness personal property in buildings or structures at a \u2018covered location\u2019 or in the open (or in vehicles) on or within 1,000 feet of a \u2018covered location.\u2019 \u201d The contract\u2019s definition of a \u201ccovered location\u201d explains that \u201cif the Scheduled Locations Endorsement is added to this policy, \u2018covered location\u2019 means a location that is described on the Location Schedule.\u201d Jane Street and Aspen did include a Scheduled Locations Endorsement to the policy, and it describes the \u201cCovered Location\u201d as \u201cOne New York Plaza, 33rd Floor, New York NY 10004.\u201d The text preceding that location reads: \u201cCoverage provided by the [policy] applies only to the \u2018covered locations\u2019 described below.\u201d Although the policy insured against \u201cdirect physical loss\u201d to Jane Street\u2019s property \u201cat locations that are not described on the Locations Schedule,\u201d the policy limited Aspen\u2019s obligations to $50,000 \u201cin any one occurrence for each unscheduled location.\u201d</p>\n<p id=\"b78-9\">The plain meaning of the policy is that: property inside a building or structure that is on the 33rd floor of One New York Plaza is covered (along with property in the open, or in vehicles, on or within 1,000 feet thereof), while for all other property a $50,000 limit applies.<footnotemark>1</footnotemark> <em>Cf. T &amp; G Knitwear Co. v. Home Ins. Co., </em>156 A.D.2d 126, 548 N.Y.S.2d 29, 30 (App.Div.1989) (holding that an insurance policy\u2019s definition of a covered location as the second and third floors of a building rendered property in the sixth floor of the building \u201cnot in an insured location\u201d). Jane Street\u2019s flood-damaged generator was located in One New York Plaza\u2019s (unscheduled) basement and not on the building\u2019s (covered) 33rd floor. The policy required no more of Aspen than the $50,000 payment that it tendered to Jane Street.</p>\n<p id=\"b78-10\">Having concluded that the policy did not entitle Jane Street to more than what Aspen has paid, we agree with the district court that Jane Street\u2019s claim of bad faith is without merit. <em>See Sukup v. State of N.Y., </em>19 N.Y.2d 519, 281 N.Y.S.2d 28, 227 N.E.2d 842, 844 (1967) (holding that, to support a claim of bad faith, the insured must demonstrate that \u201cno reasonable carrier would, under the given facts\u201d have denied coverage).</p>\n<p id=\"b78-11\">For the foregoing reasons, and finding no merit in Jane Street\u2019s other arguments, <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"51\">*51</page-number>we hereby AFFIRM the judgment of the district court.</p>\n<footnote label=\"1\">\n<p id=\"b78-6\">. This straightforward interpretation applies with equal force to the policy's Flood Endorsement, which \u201ccover[s] direct physical loss to <em>covered property at \u2018covered locations\u2019 </em>caused by \u2018flood\u2019 \u201d (emphasis added).</p>\n</footnote>\n</opinion>\n</casebody>\n",
