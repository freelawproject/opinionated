Because the district court correctly determined that it lacks jurisdiction over Dudley\u2019s action, we affirm.</p>\n<p id=\"b862-19\">The district court dismissed Dudley\u2019s federal case because he sought federal court review of a state court\u2019s decision against him in a state foreclosure action. On appeal, Dudley does not dispute that \u201cthe purpose of this [action] is to request the Supreme Court of Florida to correct the error of the lower courts,\u201d that is, the Florida state courts which exercised jurisdiction over his foreclosure.</p>\n<p id=\"b862-20\">However, as the district court\u2019s order correctly concludes, \u201cfederal district courts have no authority to review final judgments of a state court.\u201d <em>Lozman v. City of Riviera Beach, Fla., </em>713 F.3d 1066, 1072 (11th Cir.2013) (quotation mark omitted); <em>see also Casale v. Tillman, </em>558 F.3d 1258, 1260 (11th Cir.2009) (per curiam) (\u201cThe <em>Rooker-Feldman </em>doctrine makes clear that federal district courts cannot review state court final judgments because that task is reserved for state appellate courts or, as a last resort, the United States Supreme Court.\u201d). Dudley\u2019s action in the federal district court falls squarely within the narrow scope of cases which cannot be entertained in federal district courts under <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"835\">*835</page-number>the <em>Rooker-Feldman </em>doctrine.<footnotemark>1</footnotemark> His case is one \u201cbrought by [a] state-court loser[ ] complaining of injuries caused by state-court judgments rendered before the district court proceedings commenced and inviting district court review and rejection of those judgments.\u201d <em>Exxon Mobil Corp. v. Saudi Basic Indus. Corp., </em>544 U.S. 280, 284, 125 S.Ct. 1517, 1521-22, 161 L.Ed.2d 454 (2005). The district court therefore correctly concluded that it cannot exercise jurisdiction over Dudley\u2019s action. As a result, we find no error in the district court\u2019s <em>sua sponte </em>dismissal of Dudley\u2019s complaint or its denial of his motion for reconsideration.</p>\n<p id=\"b863-5\">AFFIRMED.</p>\n<footnote label=\"1\">\n<p id=\"b863-14\">. The <em>Rooker-Feldman </em>doctrine stems from the United States Supreme Court\u2019s decisions in <em>Rooker v.
