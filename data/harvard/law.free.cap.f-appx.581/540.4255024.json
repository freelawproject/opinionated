Quist, United States District Judge for the Western District of Michigan, sitting by designation.</p>\n</footnote>\n<opinion data-order=\"6\" data-type=\"opinion\" id=\"x999-2\" type=\"majority\">\n<author id=\"b568-18\">PER CURIAM.</author>\n<p id=\"b568-19\">Ishmael Bahena-Figueroa, a federal prisoner, appeals the 135-month sentence of imprisonment imposed following his 2013 guilty plea to a charge of conspiring to possess with intent to distribute more than one kilogram of heroin.</p>\n<p id=\"b568-20\">The statutory mandatory-minimum sentence for this offense is 120 months. The presentence report arrived at a Guidelines range of 262 to 327 months. The government moved for a two-level reduction in the offense level, resulting in a Guidelines range of 210 to 262 months. The district court rejected Bahena-Figueroa\u2019s argument that he should not be given a two-level increase for a leadership role under USSG \u00a7 3Bl.l(c). The parties however agreed that a downward variance to 135 <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"541\">*541</page-number>months would be appropriate in light of the sentence contemplated by the plea agreement. The district court adopted this suggestion.</p>\n<p id=\"b569-5\">On appeal, Bahena-Figueroa\u2019s sole argument is that the court erred in assessing the two-point enhancement for a leadership role. We review a criminal sentence under an abuse-of discretion standard for procedural and substantive reasonableness. <em>United States v. Bolds, </em>511 F.3d 568, 578 (6th Cir.2007). Although this court has traditionally reviewed the imposition of a sentencing enhancement for clear error in the factual findings and de novo on legal conclusions, <em>see United States v. McDaniel </em>398 F.3d 540, 551 n. 10 (6th Cir.2005), we recently held, in light of developing Supreme Court precedent, that such decisions are subject to deferential review, <em>see United States v. Washington, </em>715 F.3d 975, 983 (6th Cir.2013). Under either standard of review, Bahena-Figueroa cannot prevail.</p>\n<p id=\"b569-6\">Section 3B1.1 of the Sentencing Guidelines provides for a 2-, 3-, or 4-level enhancement to the offense level for defendants who are determined to be organizers, leaders, managers, or supervisors in a criminal activity. The statements of Bahena-Figueroa\u2019s co-defendants all indicated that Bahena-Figueroa instructed them on where to sell the heroin and to whom to send the proceeds. Bahena-Figueroa argues that he was merely passing on information from higher-ups in Mexico. He argues that his situation is similar to that of the defendant in <em>United States v. Vandeberg, </em>201 F.3d 805, 811 (6th Cir.2000). Vandeberg provided information to a burglar about a victim\u2019s house, schedule, and security system but did not take a leadership role in planning the details of the offense. <em>Id. </em>at 807, 811. Bahena-Figueroa, however, instructed the other members of the conspiracy how to dispose of the drugs and drug proceeds. The district court concluded that he was essentially a \u201clocal manager\u201d of the conspiracy. We defer to this finding, which correctly applies the law and is not based on clearly erroneous findings of fact.</p>\n<p id=\"b569-8\">Moreover, given that the district court granted a downward variance nearly to the mandatory minimum sentence, Bahena-Figueroa cannot meet the heavy burden required to demonstrate that his sentence is substantively unreasonable. <em>See United States v. Curry, </em>536 F.3d 571, 573 (6th Cir.2008). Accordingly, we affirm the district court\u2019s judgment.</p>\n</opinion>\n</casebody>\n",
