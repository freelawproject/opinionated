LUCERO, Circuit Judge.</author>\n<p id=\"b752-22\">Andrew Anthony Gomez, a state prisoner proceeding pro se, appeals the district <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"725\">*725</page-number>court\u2019s dismissal of his 42 U.S.C. \u00a7 1983 action for failure to exhaust administrative remedies as required by the Prison Litigation Reform Act (\u201cPLRA\u201d), 42 U.S.C. \u00a7 1997e(a). We have jurisdiction under 28 U.S.C. \u00a7 1291. Because Gomez did not properly exhaust his administrative remedies, we affirm.</p>\n<p id=\"b753-5\">I</p>\n<p id=\"b753-6\">On November 19, 2012, Gomez filed a pro se complaint alleging that his Eighth Amendment rights were violated and that prison officials were deliberately indifferent.<footnotemark>1</footnotemark> Gomez\u2019s complaint claims that he received inadequate medical care after he was beaten by a fellow inmate while attempting to prevent that inmate from attacking prison staff. Over Gomez\u2019s objection that prison staff had thwarted his access to administrative remedies, the district court concluded that he had not properly exhausted his administrative remedies. The district court therefore dismissed Gomez\u2019s complaint, which had by then become time-barred, with prejudice. Gomez timely appealed.</p>\n<p id=\"b753-7\">II</p>\n<p id=\"b753-8\">The PLRA requires that \u201cavailable\u201d administrative remedies be exhausted prior to filing a \u00a7 1983 action with respect to prison conditions. 42 U.S.C. \u00a7 1997e(a). Our review of a dismissal under the PLRA for failure to exhaust administrative remedies is de novo. <em>Patel v. Fleming, </em>415 F.3d 1105, 1108 (10th Cir.2005). On appeal, Gomez repeats a claim he made in district court that prison officials mishandled his informal grievances, thereby thwarting his attempts to exhaust his administrative remedies. <em>See Little v. Jones, </em>607 F.3d 1245, 1250 (10th Cir.2010) (excus<em>ing </em>failure to exhaust administrative remedies \u201cwhere prison officials prevent, thwart, or hinder a prisoner\u2019s efforts to avail himself of an administrative remedy\u201d). Notwithstanding the status of Gomez\u2019s informal grievances, the district court held that because Gomez failed to file a formal grievance \u2014 the next step in the administrative process \u2014 he failed to exhaust his remedies.</p>\n<p id=\"b753-12\">Gomez attempts to justify his failure to file a formal grievance because New Mexico\u2019s prison policy does not explicitly provide that an inmate whose informal grievance receives no response from prison officials can file a formal grievance. He argues that because his formal grievance would have been returned for lack of an attached informal grievance, his failure to file a formal grievance should be excused.</p>\n<p id=\"b753-13\">Gomez\u2019s arguments are unavailing. He should have attempted to file a formal grievance after it was apparent that he would not receive a response to his informal complaint, and admits that he did not do so. Gomez did not meet his burden of showing that the remedy he failed to seek \u2014 a formal grievance \u2014 was unavailable to him. <em>See Tuckel v. Grover, </em>660 F.3d 1249, 1254 (10th Cir.2011). Thus, allowing his claim to proceed into the court system would be inconsistent with the PLRA. <em>See Whitington v. Ortiz, </em>472 F.3d 804, 807 (10th Cir.2007) (explaining that the PLRA\u2019s exhaustion requirement aims to \u201creduce the quantity and improve the quality of prisoner suits by (1) allowing prison officials an opportunity to satisfy the inmate\u2019s complaint \u2014 thus obviating the need for litigation; (2) filtering out some frivolous claims; and (3) creating an adminis<page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"726\">*726</page-number>trative record that facilitates review of cases that are ultimately brought to court.\u201d).</p>\n<p id=\"b754-4\">Ill</p>\n<p id=\"b754-5\">We AFFIRM the district court\u2019s judgment that Gomez failed to exhaust his administrative remedies. We GRANT Gomez\u2019s motion to proceed in forma pauperis, but remind him of his obligation to make partial payments until the district court and appellate filing fees are paid in full. <em>See </em>28 U.S.C. \u00a7 1915(b)(1).</p>\n<footnote label=\"*\">\n<p id=\"b752-9\"> After examining appellant\u2019s brief and the appellate record, this panel has determined unanimously that oral argument would not materially assist the determination of this appeal. <em>See </em>Fed. R.App. P. 34(a)(2) and 10th Cir. R. 34.1(G). The case is therefore ordered submitted without oral argument. This order and judgment is not binding precedent, except under the doctrines of law of the case, res judicata, and collateral estoppel. It may be cited, however, for its persuasive value consistent with Fed. R.App. P. 32.1 and 10th Cir. R. 32.1.</p>\n</footnote>\n<footnote label=\"1\">\n<p id=\"b753-9\">. Because Gomez is proceeding pro se, we construe his filings liberally. <em>See Hall v. Bellmon, </em>935 F.2d 1106, 1110 (10th Cir.1991).</p>\n</footnote>\n</opinion>\n</casebody>\n",
