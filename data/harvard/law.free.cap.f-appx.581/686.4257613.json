We have jurisdiction under 28 U.S.C. \u00a7 2253. We review a district <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"687\">*687</page-number>court\u2019s denial of a habeas corpus petition de novo, <em>see Stanley v. Cullen, </em>633 F.3d 852, 859 (9th Cir.2011), and we affirm.</p>\n<p id=\"b715-5\">Grice contends that the trial court violated his rights to present a defense and to confrontation under the Sixth and Fourteenth Amendments when it limited Grice\u2019s ability to cross-examine a prosecution witness with her prior misdemeanor arrests and convictions. The California Court of Appeal\u2019s rejection of this claim was not contrary to, or an unreasonable application of, clearly established federal law. <em>See </em>28 U.S.C. \u00a7 2254(d)(1); <em>see Michigan v. Lucas, </em>500 U.S. 145, 151, 111 S.Ct. 1743, 114 L.Ed.2d 205 (1991) (\u201cRestrictions on a criminal defendant\u2019s rights to confront adverse witnesses and to present evidence may not be arbitrary or disproportionate to the purposes they are designed to serve.\u201d (internal quotations omitted)).</p>\n<p id=\"b715-6\">Grice\u2019s petition to the district court also alleged that (1) his trial counsel was ineffective for failing to discover and present evidence of the victim\u2019s violent history, and (2) the trial court violated his right to present a defense when it excluded testimony about Grice\u2019s pre-trial custodial status. The district court issued a certificate of appealability as to these issues. On appeal, Grice\u2019s counsel states that no further briefing is necessary. Our independent review of the record pursuant to <em>Penson v. Ohio, </em>488 U.S. 75, 80, 109 S.Ct. 346, 102 L.Ed.2d 300 (1988), discloses no arguable grounds for relief on these claims.</p>\n<p id=\"b715-7\">AFFIRMED.</p>\n<footnote label=\"**\">\n<p id=\"b714-26\"> This disposition is not appropriate for publication and is not precedent except as provided by 9th Cir.
