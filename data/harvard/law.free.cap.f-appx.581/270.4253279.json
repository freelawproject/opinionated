The district court sentenced Solomon to concurrent sentences of 188 months of imprisonment on each count. Solomon appeals his convictions and sentence. Finding no reversible error, we affirm.'</p>\n<p id=\"b299-17\">Solomon contends that the district court erred in permitting Special Agent Brian Pruitt of the Department of Homeland Security to testify about what Joelene Small and Ronnie George told him during his investigation and to bolster their credibility. Federal Rule of Evidence 103(a) requires that, to preserve for appellate review an objection to evidence, the objection must be specific, timely, and of record. <em>See United States v. Cabrera-Beltran, </em>660 F.3d 742, 751 (4th Cir.2011); <em>United States v. Parodi, </em>703 F.2d 768, 783 (4th Cir.1983). Solomon\u2019s objections at trial were insufficient to preserve the alleged error on ap<page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"272\">*272</page-number>peal; accordingly, we review Solomon\u2019s claim for plain error. <em>See Cabrera-Beltran, </em>660 F.3d at 751.</p>\n<p id=\"b300-4\">Under the plain error standard of review, Fed.R.Crim.P. 52(b) \u201cauthorizes an appeals court to correct a forfeited error only if (1) there is an error, (2) the error is plain, and (3) the error affects substantial rights.\u201d <em>Henderson v. United States, </em>\u2014 U.S. -, 133 S.Ct. 1121, 1126, 185 L.Ed.2d 85 (2013) (internal quotation marks and brackets omitted). Because Rule 52(b) is permissive, we will correct such an error only if it \u201cseriously affects the fairness, integrity or public reputation of judicial proceedings.\u201d <em>Id. </em>at 1127 (internal quotations marks and brackets omitted).</p>\n<p id=\"b300-7\">Solomon\u2019s reliance on this court\u2019s decision in <em>United States v. Bolick, </em>917 F.2d 135 (4th Cir.1990), is misplaced. In <em>Bolick, </em>we reversed the defendant\u2019s conviction after concluding that the government agent had improperly testified that three impeached witnesses told him that the defendant was their source for cocaine. <em>Id. </em>at 140-43. Importantly, we found that the government\u2019s entire case against Bolick relied exclusively on the observations of those three witnesses, whose \u201ccharacter for veracity ... was extremely doubtful.\u201d <em>Id. </em>at 140. However, in <em>Ross v. Saint Augustine\u2019s Coll, </em>103 F.3d 338 (4th Cir. 1996), we held that <em>Bolick </em>is distinguishable from a case in which the underlying witness was not particularly suspect and was subject to cross-examination, and the statements at issue were corroborated by other evidence. <em>Id. </em>at 342. The instant case is more akin to <em>Ross </em>than <em>Bolick; </em>thus, the district court did not plainly err in admitting the agent\u2019s testimony regarding the statements of Joelene Small and Ronnie George. We likewise conclude that the district court\u2019s failure to exclude certain limited remarks pertaining to the truthfulness of the same two witnesses, several of which were made in response to defense counsel\u2019s own questions and to which Solomon did not object, did not \u201cseriously affect[] the fairness, integrity or public reputation of judicial proceedings.\u201d <em>Henderson, </em>133 S.Ct. at 1127.</p>\n<p id=\"b300-9\">Solomon next asserts that the district court violated his Sixth Amendment rights under the Confrontation Clause by denying his requests to cross-examine Ronnie George regarding three violations of the terms of George\u2019s pretrial supervised release. Pursuant to Federal Rule of Evidence 611(b), \u201c[c]ross-examination should not go beyond the subject matter of the direct examination and matters affecting the witness\u2019s credibility.\u201d We review a district court\u2019s limitation on the scope of the cross-examination of a government witness only for an abuse of discretion. <em>United States v. Zayyad, </em>741 F.3d 452, 458 (4th Cir.2014). The district court \u201cpossesses wide latitude to impose reasonable limits on cross-examination, premised on such concerns as prejudice, confusion, repetition, and relevance.\u201d <em>United States v. Smith, </em>451 F.3d 209, 221 (4th Cir.2006).</p>\n<p id=\"b300-10\">Our review of the record convinces us that there is no such abuse of discretion in this case. The district court reasonably concluded that none of the cited violations pertained to George\u2019s character for truthfulness, and discussion of those purported violations risked the danger of confusing and misleading the jury. We thus conclude that the trial court properly restricted defense counsel\u2019s cross examination of George.</p>\n<p id=\"b300-11\">Solomon next contends that the district court committed plain error when it failed to arraign him on the superseding indictment. Rule 10 of the Federal Rules of Criminal Procedure requires that a defendant be apprised in open court of \u201cthe <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"273\">*273</page-number>substance of the charge\u201d before being called upon to plead. However, technical noncompliance with the procedural requirements of the rule does not warrant reversal of a conviction if not raised before trial. <em>See United States v. Reynolds, </em>781 F.2d 135, 136 n. 2 (8th Cir.1986). \u201cA failure to arraign only warrants a reversal if it causes prejudice or impairs a substantial right.\u201d <em>United States v. Williams, </em>152 F.3d 294, 299 (4th Cir.1998) (citing <em>Garland v. Washington, </em>232 U.S. 642, 34 S.Ct. 456, 58 L.Ed. 772 (1914)).</p>\n<p id=\"b301-5\">In Solomon\u2019s case, the additional importation charges in the superseding indictment spanned the same time frame as the original charges and involved the same activities. The parties addressed all of the charges through argument and the introduction of evidence. Moreover, Solomon\u2019s attorney had received a copy of the superseding indictment. We find that Solomon has failed to establish either prejudice or the impairment of a substantial right.</p>\n<p id=\"b301-6\">Finally, Solomon asserts there is an unwarranted sentencing disparity because his codefendant, Ronnie George, received a shorter sentence than Solomon. We review sentences for procedural and substantive reasonableness under an abuse of discretion standard. <em>Gall v. United States, </em>552 U.S. 38, 51, 128 S.Ct. 586, 169 L.Ed.2d 445 (2007). The district court acted within its broad discretion when it imposed on Solomon a 188-month sentence; as the district court observed, Solomon\u2019s role in the offense, his efforts to obstruct justice, and George\u2019s cooperation with the Government warranted the challenged disparity. Moreover, we, along with numerous other circuits, have recognized that 18 U.S.C. \u00a7 3553(a)(6) (2012) is aimed at eliminating national sentencing disparities, not disparities between codefendants. <em>United States v. Withers, </em>100 F.3d 1142, 1149 (4th Cir.1996); <em>see also United States v. Simmons, </em>501 F.3d 620, 623-24 (6th Cir.2007) (collecting cases).</p>\n<p id=\"b301-8\">For the reasons stated herein, we affirm the district court\u2019s judgment. We dispense with oral argument because the facts and legal contentions are adequately presented in the materials before this court and argument would not aid the decisional process.</p>\n<p id=\"b301-9\">\n<em>AFFIRMED.</em>\n</p>\n</opinion>\n</casebody>\n",
