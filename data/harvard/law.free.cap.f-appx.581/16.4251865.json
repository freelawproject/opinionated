Ford Aviation Investment and Reform Act for the 21st Century (\u201cAIR 21\u201d), 49 U.S.C. \u00a7 42121. In particular, the ALJ found that Unified had discharged employee John Nagle after Nagle had informed Unified that he suspected that another employee, \u201cM,\u201d was abusing prescription medication. We assume the parties\u2019 familiarity with the underlying facts and procedural history of the case.</p>\n<p id=\"b45-15\">Under AIR 21, we review the ARB\u2019s Final Decision and Order in accordance with the judicial review provisions of the Administrative Procedure Act (\u201cAPA\u201d), 5 U.S.C. \u00a7\u00a7 702-706. <em>See </em>49 U.S.C. \u00a7 42121(b)(4)(A). \u2018We will uphold a decision by the ARB if it is not \u2018arbitrary, capricious, an abuse of discretion, or otherwise not in accordance with law,\u2019 5 U.S.C. \u00a7 706(2)(A), or \u2018unsupported by substantial evidence,\u2019 <em>id. </em>\u00a7 706(2)(E).\u201d <em>Bechtel v. Admin. Review Bd., </em>710 F.3d 443, 445-46 (2d Cir.2013). \u201cUnder this deferential standard of review, \u2018we must assess, among other matters, whether the decision was based on a consideration of the relevant factors and whether there has been a clear error of judgment.\u2019 \u201d <em>Id. </em>at 446 (quoting <em>Judulang v. Holder, </em>\u2014 U.S.-, 132 S.Ct. 476, 484, 181 L.Ed.2d 449 (2011)). We have not decided whether to afford deference in analogous contexts to the ARB under <em>Chevron, U.S.A., Inc. v. Natural Res. Def. Council, </em>467 U.S. 837, 842-43, 104 S.Ct. 2778, 81 L.Ed.2d 694 (1984). <em>See Nielsen v. AECOM Tech. Corp., </em>762 F.3d 214, 219 (2d Cir.2014). But some deference may nevertheless be due to the ARB because of the \u201cthoroughness evident in its consideration, the validity of its reasoning, its consistency with earlier and <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"18\">*18</page-number>later pronouncements, and all those factors which give it power to persuade.\u201d <em>Skidmore v. Swift &amp; Co., </em>323 U.S. 134, 140, 65 S.Ct. 161, 89 L.Ed. 124 (1944); <em>see also United States v. Mead Corp., </em>533 U.S. 218, 234-35, 121 S.Ct. 2164, 150 L.Ed.2d 292 (2001).</p>\n<p id=\"b46-4\">AIR 21 prohibits air carriers and their contractors from \u201cdischarging] an employee or otherwise discriminating] against an employee with respect to compensation, terms, conditions, or privileges of employment because the employee ... provided ... to the employer or Federal Government information relating to any violation or alleged violation of any ... regulation ... of the Federal Aviation Administration. ...\u201d 49 U.S.C. \u00a7 42121(a). To prevail on a whistleblower retaliation claim under AIR 21,</p>\n<blockquote id=\"b46-5\">an employee must prove by a preponderance of the evidence that (l)[he] engaged in protected activity; (2) the employer knew that [he] engaged in the protected activity; (3)[he] suffered an unfavorable personnel action; and (4) the protected activity was a contributing factor in the unfavorable action. If the employee establishes these four elements, the employer may avoid liability if it can prove by clear and convincing evidence that it would have taken the same unfavorable personnel action in the absence of that protected behavior.</blockquote>\n<p id=\"AF\"><em>Bechtel, </em>710 F.3d at 447 (quoting <em>Harp v. Charter Commc\u2019ns, Inc., </em>558 F.3d 722, 723 (7th Cir.2009) (brackets omitted)).</p>\n<p id=\"b46-6\">In its petition for review, Unified challenges the agency\u2019s determinations with respect to the first, third, and fourth elements of this test. With respect to the first element, we find to be supported by substantial evidence the ALJ\u2019s conclusion that Nagle\u2019s statement on December 16, 2008 that he saw M selling drugs outside of Unified and that M had \u201cproblems\u201d constituted protected activity under AIR 21. The ALJ inferred from the language of Nagle\u2019s statement and his two prior protected complaints that Nagle viewed M\u2019s alleged drug sale as further evidence that M was abusing prescription medication and that his work was suffering. This inference is a logical reading of Nagle\u2019s statement, and the agency did not abuse its discretion in concluding that Nagle reasonably believed that such abuse was in violation of Federal Aviation Administration safety regulations.</p>\n<p id=\"b46-8\">As for the third element, Unified argues both that the ARB\u2019s interpretation of the statutory term \u201cdischarge\u201d was erroneous and that substantial evidence does not support the agency\u2019s finding that Unified discharged Nagle when it did not follow up after Nagle failed to report to work following an altercation with M. The ARB interprets the term \u201cdischarge\u201d in the whistleblower retaliation context to include situations in which an employee has not actually resigned, but \u201can employer ... decides to interpret an employee\u2019s actions as a quit or resignation.\u201d <em>Klosterman v. E.J. Davies, Inc., </em>ARB No. 08-035, 2010 WL 3878518, at *5 (ARB Sept. 30, 2010). While this reading does not mirror the definition that we have applied to similar terms in other employment laws, the ARB has a significant expertise in handling whistleblower claims, <em>cf. Community Health Center v. Wilson-Coker, </em>311 F.3d 132, 138 (2d Cir.2002), and has consistently deployed this definition of discharge, <em>see Klosterman, </em>2010 WL 3878518, at *5, which furthers the statute\u2019s purpose of protecting employees from retaliation. Accordingly, we defer to the ARB\u2019s reasonable interpretation. <em>See Skidmore, </em>323 U.S. at 140, 65 S.Ct. 161. Moreover, we find that the agency\u2019s conclusion that Unified discharged Nagle was, under this standard, amply supported by substantial evidence in the record. Although Unified\u2019s position that Nagle voluntarily quit <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"19\">*19</page-number>is not without some support in the record, that is insufficient to overturn the agency\u2019s conclusion under our deferential standard of review. <em>See Bechtel, </em>710 F.3d at 446 (requiring a finding of no abuse of discretion where, <em>inter alia, </em>\u201cthe decision was based on a consideration of the relevant factors and ... there has been [no] clear error of judgment\u201d).</p>\n<p id=\"b47-5\">Finally, with respect to the fourth element, Unified argues that substantial evidence does not support the agency\u2019s determination that Nagle\u2019s protected complaints were a \u201ccontributing factor\u201d in Nagle\u2019s discharge. In particular, Unified challenges as based only on \u201cspeculation\u201d the ALJ\u2019s conclusion that the \u201clikely reason\u201d for the December 24 altercation was that M was angry about Nagle\u2019s December 16 complaint. But the ALJ relied on substantial evidence in the record for this conclusion, including that Unified\u2019s owners testified that they likely told M of Nagle\u2019s complaint within a day or two of December 16 and that they told M it was Nagle who made the accusation; that Nagle and another witness testified credibly that M was the aggressor in the fight; and that there was no evidence in the record to support \u201cany other reason for M being upset with Nagle\u201d on that day. We therefore conclude that the ARB\u2019s adoption of the ALJ\u2019s conclusion that Nagle\u2019s protected complaint was a contributing factor in Nagle\u2019s discharge was not an abuse of discretion.</p>\n<p id=\"b47-6\">Accordingly, we find that the ARB\u2019s determination that Unified discharged Nagle in violation of AIR 21 was not an abuse of its discretion. We have considered Unified\u2019s remaining arguments and find them to be without merit. For the reasons stated herein, the petition for review is DENIED.</p>\n</opinion>\n</casebody>\n",
