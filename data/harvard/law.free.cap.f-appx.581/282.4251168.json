George were negligent in a car collision. The Georges removed the case to the United States District Court for the <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"283\">*283</page-number>District of South Carolina. Concluding that subject matter jurisdiction over the complaint was lacking, the district court accepted the recommendation of the magistrate judge and issued an order remanding the action to state court. The Georges moved for reconsideration, which the district court denied. The Georges noted an appeal from both orders. We dismiss the appeal.</p>\n<p id=\"b311-5\">Pursuant to 28 U.S.C. \u00a7 1447(d) (2012), \u201c[a]n order remanding a case to the State court from which it was removed is not reviewable on appeal or otherwise, except that an order remanding a case to the State court from which it was removed pursuant to [28 U.S.C. \u00a7 ] 1442 or 1443 ... shall be reviewable.\u201d The Supreme Court has construed \u00a7 1447(d) to insulate from appellate review those remand orders based on the grounds specified in \u00a7 1447(c): a defect in the removal procedure and a lack of subject matter jurisdiction. <em>Quackenbush v. Allstate Ins. Co., </em>517 U.S. 706, 711-12, 116 S.Ct. 1712, 135 L.Ed.2d 1 (1996). In this case, the district court concluded that it lacked subject matter jurisdiction over the complaint. Further, this case does not implicate \u00a7 1442, concerning cases against federal officers and agencies, or \u00a7 1443, concerning civil rights cases. Accordingly, the district court\u2019s remand order is not subject to appellate review. <em>Ellenburg v. Spartan Motors Chassis, Inc., </em>519 F.3d 192, 196 (4th Cir.2008). Moreover, having determined that subject matter jurisdiction over the action was lacking, the district court was without jurisdiction to consider the Georges\u2019 motion to reconsider. <em>In re Lowe, </em>102 F.3d 731, 734-36 (4th Cir.1996).</p>\n<p id=\"b311-6\">Accordingly, we deny leave to proceed in forma pauperis and dismiss the appeal. We dispense with oral argument because the facts and legal contentions are adequately presented in the materials before this court and argument would not aid the decisional process.</p>\n<p id=\"b311-8\">\n<em>DISMISSED.</em>\n</p>\n</opinion>\n</casebody>\n",
