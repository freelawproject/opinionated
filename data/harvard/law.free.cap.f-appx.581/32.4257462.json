On appeal, Simmonds contends that insufficient evidence supports the jury\u2019s verdict. We assume the parties\u2019 familiarity with the underlying facts, procedural history, and specification of issues for review.</p>\n<p id=\"b61-7\">A defendant seeking to overturn a jury verdict on sufficiency grounds \u201cbears a heavy burden,\u201d <em>United States v. Aguilar, </em>585 F.3d 652, 656 (2d Cir.2009), as we exercise an \u201cexceedingly deferential standard of review,\u201d <em>United States v. Hassan, </em>578 F.3d 108, 126 (2d Cir.2008). We must view the evidence \u201cin a light that is most favorable to the government, and with all reasonable inferences resolved in favor of the government.\u201d <em>United States v. Persico, </em>645 F.3d 85, 104 (2d Cir.2011). In reviewing sufficiency challenges, \u201cwe defer to the jury\u2019s determination of the weight of the evidence and the credibility of the witnesses, and to the jury\u2019s choice of the competing inferences that can be drawn from the evidence.\u201d <em>United States v. Si Lu Tian, </em>339 F.3d 143, 150 (2d Cir.2003) (citation and internal quotation marks omitted).</p>\n<p id=\"b61-8\">Contrary to Simmonds\u2019s assertions, based on the evidence introduced at trial, a \u201crational trier of fact could have found the essential elements of the crime beyond a reasonable doubt.\u201d <em>See Aguilar, </em>585 F.3d at 656 (internal quotation marks omitted). Sufficient direct and circumstantial evidence supports Simmonds\u2019s conviction: (1) Simmonds picked up Gayle late at night in the parking lot of a casino near the Canadian border after she witnessed Gayle alight from an all terrain vehicle; (2) Gayle told Simmonds that he had crossed into the United States by boat; (3) a Border Patrol agent testified that crossing at the Massena port of entry added significant time and distance to Simmonds\u2019s route to her destination in Springfield, Massachusetts; (4) Border Patrol agents testified that Simmonds knew the location of and retrieved Gayle\u2019s passport from a bag in the back seat of her car; and (5) Gayle\u2019s testimony contained internal inconsistencies and contradicted some of Simmonds\u2019s post arrest statements, particularly with respect to the manner in which Gayle and Simmonds arranged to meet. <em>See United States v. Gaskin, </em>364 F.3d 438, 461 (2d Cir.2004) (observing element of knowledge \u201coften can be proved only by circumstantial evidence\u201d). Deferring to the jury\u2019s assessments of witness credibility, <em>United States v. Payne, </em>591 F.3d 46, 60 (2d Cir. 2010), we reject Simmonds\u2019s sufficiency challenge.</p>\n<p id=\"b61-10\">Simmonds points to facts in the record that indicate that she was an unwitting victim of circumstance, for example, Gayle testified that Simmonds was surprised to learn that he had crossed into the United States and did not know that he was inadmissible; Simmonds did not conceal Gayle\u2019s belongings in her car; and Simmonds cooperated with immigration officials. However, the jury rejected Simmonds\u2019s theory that she was an innocent dupe in Gayle\u2019s attempt to smuggle himself into the United States. On appeal, the task of this Court is not to re-weigh competing evidence but to determine only whether the totality of the evidence, viewed in the light most favorable to the government, could support a rational jury <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"34\">*34</page-number>verdict of guilty. <em>See United States v. Morgan, </em>385 F.3d 196, 204 (2d Cir.2004). Because we conclude that the evidence supports the jury\u2019s verdict, we reject Simmonds\u2019s sufficiency challenge.</p>\n<p id=\"b62-4\">Accordingly, the judgment of conviction imposed by the district court is hereby AFFIRMED.</p>\n</opinion>\n</casebody>\n",
