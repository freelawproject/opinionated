He was sentenced within the applicable guidelines range to 70 months of imprisonment, to run consecutively to any other state or federal sentence.</p>\n<p id=\"b397-9\">Taylor challenges the substantive reasonableness of his sentence, arguing that the district court failed to consider mitigating factors, namely, his personal history and characteristics. As he did in the district court, Taylor directs attention to his mental health history and treatment. \u201c[A] sentence within a properly calculated Guideline range is presumptively reasonable.\u201d <em>United States v. Alonzo, </em>435 F.3d 551, 554 (5th Cir.2006). \u201cThe presumption is rebutted only upon a showing that the sentence does not account for a factor that should receive significant weight, it gives significant weight to an irrelevant or improper factor, or it represents a clear error of judgment in balancing sentencing factors.\u201d <em>United States v. Cooks, </em>589 F.3d 173, 186 (5th Cir.2009).</p>\n<p id=\"b397-10\">The district court considered the presentence investigation report, Taylor\u2019s motion for a downward variance, and his counsel\u2019s arguments at sentencing. Although Taylor pointed to mitigating evidence and circumstances that could have justified a lesser sentence, the court concluded a lesser sentence was not warranted. Specifically, it expressed concerns over, inter alia, Taylor\u2019s \u201ctroubling\u201d offender characteristics and his criminal history. Taylor has failed to rebut the presumption of reasonableness attached to his within-guidelines-range sentence. <em>See Cooks, </em>589 F.3d at 186.</p>\n<p id=\"b397-15\">AFFIRMED.</p>\n<footnote label=\"*\">\n<p id=\"b397-11\"> Pursuant to 5th Cir. R. 47.5, the court has determined that this opinion should not be published and is not precedent except under the limited circumstances set forth in 5th Cir.
