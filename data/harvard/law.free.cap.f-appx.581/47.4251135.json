Dec. 11, 2012), <em>ajfg </em>No. A088 935 745 (Immig. Ct. N.Y. City Apr. 27, 2011). We assume the parties\u2019 familiarity with the underlying facts and procedural history in this case.</p>\n<p id=\"b76-5\">Under the circumstances of this case, we have reviewed the IJ\u2019s decision as modified by the BIA. <em>See Yang v. U.S. Dep\u2019t Justice, </em>426 F.3d 520, 522 (2d Cir.2005). The applicable standards of review are well established. <em>See </em>8 U.S.C. \u00a7 1252(b)(4)(B); <em>see also Weng v. Holder, </em>562 F.3d 510, 513 (2d Cir.2009).</p>\n<p id=\"b76-6\">I. Asylum</p>\n<p id=\"b76-7\">We dismiss the petition to the extent Stasyshyn challenges the pretermission of her asylum application as untimely. We generally lack jurisdiction to review the agency\u2019s finding that an asylum application was untimely under 8 U.S.C. \u00a7 1158(a)(2)(B), (a)(3). Although we retain jurisdiction to review \u201cconstitutional claims or questions of law,\u201d 8 U.S.C. \u00a7 1252(a)(2)(D), Stasyshyn challenges only the IJ\u2019s factual findings as to the credibility of her testimony regarding her reasons for waiting more than a year after her arrival in the United States to file for asylum. We are therefore without jurisdiction to review Stasyshyn\u2019s challenge to the agency\u2019s finding that her asylum application was untimely.</p>\n<p id=\"b76-8\">II. Withholding of Removal and CAT Relief</p>\n<p id=\"b76-9\">We also deny the petition as to withholding of removal and CAT relief because the IJ\u2019s adverse credibility determination is supported by substantial evidence. For applications subject to the REAL ID Act of 2005, such as Stasyshyn\u2019s, the agency, \u201cconsidering the totality of the circumstances,\u201d may base a credibility finding on any inconsistency, including ones that do not go to the heart of the claim. 8 U.S.C. \u00a7\u00a7 1158(b)(l)(B)(iii), 1231(b)(3)(C); <em>Xiu Xia Lin v. Mukasey, </em>534 F.3d 162, 163-64 (2d Cir.2008).</p>\n<p id=\"b76-10\">The agency reasonably based its adverse credibility determination on several inconsistencies between Stasyshyn\u2019s written application and oral testimony. Stasyshyn does not contest that these inconsistencies exist in the record; instead, she argues that they are insubstantial. However, the agency relied on inconsistencies regarding the main incidents of alleged persecution\u2014 particularly Stasyshyn\u2019s changing story of her detention \u2014 and an omission from her application of the main evidence of her fear of future harm, threats to her mother and children in Ukraine.</p>\n<p id=\"b76-11\">Given these inconsistencies, the \u201ctotality of the circumstances\u201d supports the agency\u2019s adverse credibility determination: inconsistencies between her written application and testimony go to the heart of her allegations that she was subjected to past persecution and will likely be persecuted in the future. <em>See Xiu Xia Lin, </em>534 F.3d at 167. Stasyshyn\u2019s evidence regarding country conditions, which she claims corroborates her statements, does not resolve the inconsistencies in her own testimony, and thus provides no basis to overturn the adverse credibility determination.</p>\n<p id=\"b76-12\">For the foregoing reasons, the petition for review is</p>\n<p id=\"b77-4\"><page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"49\">*49</page-number>DISMISSED in part and DENIED in part.</p>\n</opinion>\n</casebody>\n",
