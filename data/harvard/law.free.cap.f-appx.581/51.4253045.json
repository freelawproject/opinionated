Dec. 31, 2012), <em>aff'g </em>No. A088 778 629 (Immig. Ct. N.Y. City June 17, 2011). We assume the parties\u2019 familiarity with the underlying facts and procedural history of this case.</p>\n<p id=\"b79-19\">Under the circumstances of this case, we have reviewed both the BIA\u2019s and IJ\u2019s decisions. <em>See Guan v. Gonzales, </em>432 F.3d 391, 394 (2d Cir.2005). The applicable standards of review are well established. <em>See </em>8 U.S.C. \u00a7 1252(b)(4)(B); <em>see also Weng v. Holder, </em>562 F.3d 510, 513 (2d Cir .2009).</p>\n<p id=\"b79-20\">An applicant like Andreas, who does not base his claim on past persecution, must establish a well-founded fear of future persecution, on account of race, religion, nationality, membership in a particular social group, or political opinion. <em>See </em>8 C.F.R. \u00a7 1208.13(b)(2)(A). To establish a well-founded fear of future persecution, an alien may show that he was singled out for persecution or there exists a pattern or practice of persecution of similarly situated people. 8 C.F.R. \u00a7 1208.13(b)(iii).</p>\n<p id=\"b80-3\"><page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"52\">*52</page-number>To establish a pattern or practice of persecution, Andreas must demonstrate that the harm to a group constitutes persecution, is perpetrated or tolerated by state actors, and is \u201cso systemic or pervasive as to amount to a pattern or practice of persecution.\u201d <em>In re AM </em>\u2014 , 23 I. &amp; N. Dec. 737, 741 (BIA 2005); <em>see also Mufied v. Mukasey, </em>508 F.3d 88, 92 (2d Cir.2007) (accepting the BIA\u2019s standard as a reasonable one, while noting that \u201c[without further elaboration [the standard does not make clear] how systemic, pervasive, or organized persecution must be before the Board would recognize it as a pattern or practice\u201d).</p>\n<p id=\"b80-4\">The evidence in the record is insufficient to show a pattern or pattern of persecution against Christians living in Indonesia. Because Andreas provided only generalized testimony regarding his fear of future persecution, the primary evidence supporting his claim consists of country reports. The agency did not err in relying heavily on the most recent evidence in the record, the State Department\u2019s 2010 International Religious Freedom Report, which identified several isolated incidents involving restrictions on the activities of Christian churches but also \u201cnumerous areas of improvements in religious freedom,\u201d including inter-faith activities and the prosecution of individuals responsible for religiously-motivated violence. Certified Administrative Record at 176; <em>see also Xiao Ji Chen v. U.S. Dep\u2019t of Justice, </em>471 F.3d 315, 342 (2d Cir.2006) (the weight accorded to the applicant\u2019s evidence \u201clies largely\u201d within the discretion of the agency (alteration and internal quotation marks omitted)). Despite Andreas\u2019s argument to the contrary, this evidence does not establish persecution that is \u201csystemic or pervasive\u201d so as to constitute a pattern or practice. <em>See Santoso v. Holder, </em>580 F.3d 110, 112 n. 1 (2d Cir.2009)(explaining that, despite lack of guidance from BIA regarding how to evaluate a pattern or practice claim, \u201cwhere the BIA explicitly discussed the pattern or practice claim and the record includes documentary evidence regarding the conditions in petitioner\u2019s homeland, we are able to reach the conclusion that the agency\u2019s decision was not erroneous\u201d).</p>\n<p id=\"b80-6\">Andreas also argues that the BIA failed to consider his claim that he would be persecuted on account of his membership in a particular social group \u2014 \u201cIndonesian Muslims who have converted to Christianity.\u201d While the BIA did not use the words \u201cparticular social group\u201d in its decision, the BIA\u2019s determination applies equally to Andreas\u2019s claims of persecution based on his conversion.</p>\n<p id=\"b80-7\">Because Andreas was unable to show that he had a well-founded fear of persecution based on his religion and conversion needed to make out an asylum claim, he was necessarily unable to meet the higher standard for withholding of removal or CAT relief. <em>See Lecaj v. Holder, </em>616 F.3d 111, 119-20 (2d Cir.2010).</p>\n<p id=\"b80-8\">For the foregoing reasons, the petition for review is DENIED.</p>\n</opinion>\n</casebody>\n",
