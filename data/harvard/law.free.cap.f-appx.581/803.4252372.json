We vacate and remand for resentencing.</p>\n<p id=\"b832-14\">I. BACKGROUND</p>\n<p id=\"b832-15\">In 1998, Temprano pled guilty in case No. 1:97-cr-00761-KMM-l (\u201cCase No. 97-761\u201d) to conspiracy to distribute and to possess with intent to distribute 50 or more grams of cocaine base, in violation of 21 U.S.C. \u00a7\u00a7 841(a)(1), (b)(1)(A) and 846; possession with intent to distribute 50 or more grams of cocaine base, in violation of 21 U.S.C. \u00a7 841(a)(1), (b)(1)(A); and distribution of 50 or more grams of cocaine base, also in violation of 21 U.S.C. \u00a7 841(a)(1), (b)(1)(A). When Temprano failed to appear for his sentencing, he was indicted in case No. l:98-cr00322-KMM-l (\u201cCase No. 98-322\u201d) for, and pled guilty to, disobeying a court order, in violation of 18 U.S.C. \u00a7 401(3); and failing to appear, in violation of 18 U.S.C. \u00a7 3146. After his initial sentencing in both cases, and following a remand op direct appeal, the district judge issued amended judgments showing he had sentenced Temprano to concurrent 188-month prison terms on each count in Case No. 97-761, to be served concurrently with a 20-month sentence in Case No. 98-322. Temprano\u2019s prison terms were to be followed by 5 years of supervised release in Case No. 97-761, and 3 years of supervised release in Case No. 98-322, to be served concurrently. The conditions of supervised release in both cases prohibited Temprano from committing another crime.</p>\n<p id=\"b832-16\">In 2011, Temprano filed a motion to reduce sentence, under 18 U.S.C. <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"805\">*805</page-number>\u00a7 3582(c)(2). The district judge granted Temprano\u2019s request in November 2011 and reduced his total sentence in both cases to 97 months of imprisonment. Temprano began his concurrent periods of supervision on November 16, 2011.</p>\n<p id=\"b833-5\">In November 2013, Temprano\u2019s probation officer issued a superseding petition to revoke his supervised release in both cases. The officer alleged Temprano had violated a condition of his supervised release by committing the following offenses, for which he had been sentenced in state court to 270 days of imprisonment: (1) possession with intent to sell cocaine, in violation of Fla. Stat. \u00a7 893.13; (2) possession of drug paraphernalia, in violation of Fla. Stat. \u00a7 893.147; and (3) cocaine possession, in violation of Fla. Stat. \u00a7 893.13. Temprano admitted the violations.</p>\n<p id=\"b833-6\">Temprano also filed a request for a downward variance. He alleged he was 65 years old at the time. His initial 188-month sentence had been reduced to 97 months (8 years and 1 month) after he already had served 13.5 years, which was 2 weeks short of his entire initial sentence with good-time credits. His wife had died a few months before his release. While on supervised release, he had lived in homeless shelters and received disability benefits. He already had served 270 days in prison for the state crimes underlying his release violation, which was his first since he began his supervision in 2011.</p>\n<p id=\"b833-7\">During his consolidated revocation hearing, Temprano again admitted the violation, and the district judge adjudicated him guilty. The judge and the parties agreed Temprano was subject to a criminal history category of I in both underlying cases and Sentencing Guidelines ranges for revocation purposes of 24-30 months in Case No. 97-761 and 12-18 months in Case No. 98-322.</p>\n<p id=\"b833-10\">Temprano\u2019s counsel reiterated the arguments raised in his request for a downward variance, noting that, \u201cin essence, he served about six years more than he should have,\u201d because he did not receive the full benefit of his \u00a7 3582(c)(2) reduction. R13 at 5. Temprano asked for a 12 to 18-month sentence, and the government recommended a 24-month sentence. The district judge stated:</p>\n<blockquote id=\"b833-11\">The Court has carefully considered the statements of all parties and the information contained in the violation report. The Court finds the defendant has violated the terms and conditions of supervised release. I hereby revoke the term of supervised release. The Court has determined that a sentence within the guideline range is appropriate.</blockquote>\n<p id=\"b833-12\">R13 at 5-6.<footnotemark>1</footnotemark> The judge sentenced Temprano to concurrent prison terms of 30 months in Case No. 97-761 and 18 months in Case No. 98-322, \u201c[pjursuant to the Sentencing Reform Act of 1984.\u201d R13 at 6. When asked for objections, Temprano objected to the substantive reasonableness of his sentences. The judge replied: \u201cAnd we\u2019ll deny the motion for a variance.\u201d R13 at 6.</p>\n<p id=\"b833-13\">Temprano argues on appeal that his sentences are proeedurally unreasonable, because the district judge failed to state any reasons for imposing them. He contends the judge did not address his motion for a variance until after sentencing him. Additionally, there is no indication in the record the judge considered any of the statutory factors, including those raised in his motion. Furthermore, the judge did not ad<page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"806\">*806</page-number>dress the government\u2019s request for a 24-month sentence.</p>\n<p id=\"b834-4\">The government responds that Temprano\u2019s procedural-error argument should be reviewed for plain error, because he did not raise it before the district judge. The government further argues the district judge\u2019s explanation was adequate under 18 U.S.C. \u00a7 3553(c), and the judge\u2019s reference to the Sentencing Reform Act of 1984 sufficiently invoked the \u00a7 3553(a) sentencing factors.</p>\n<p id=\"b834-5\">II. DISCUSSION</p>\n<p id=\"b834-6\">We review de novo whether a district judge adequately explained a chosen sentence under \u00a7 3553(c)(1), even if the defendant did not object before the district judge. <em>United States v. Bonilla, </em>463 F.3d 1176, 1181 (11th Cir.2006). Under \u00a7 3553(c)(1), a sentencing judge \u201cshall state in open court the reasons for [his] imposition of the particular sentence\u201d; if the sentence exceeds 24 months and is within the advisory Sentencing Guidelines range, \u201cthe reason for imposing a sentence at a particular point within the range.\u201d 18 U.S.C. \u00a7 3553(c)(1) (cross-referencing 18 U.S.C. \u00a7 3553(a)(4)). The judge should set forth enough to satisfy the appellate court he has considered the parties\u2019 arguments and has a reasoned basis for exercising his legal decision-making authority. <em>Rita v. United States, </em>551 U.S. 338, 356, 127 S.Ct. 2456, 2468, 168 L.Ed.2d 203 (2007). When a judge fails to comply with \u00a7 3553(c)(1), \u201cthe sentence is imposed in violation of law.\u201d <em>United States v. Veteto, </em>920 F.2d 823, 826 (11th Cir.1991). A judge\u2019s determination that a given sentence is appropriate, without more detail, \u201cis a truism' and not an explanation.\u201d <em>Id. </em>(vacating for re-sentencing, because the judge\u2019s statement that the defendant\u2019s within-Guidelines sentence \u201cseems right\u201d was insufficient).</p>\n<p id=\"b834-8\">Upon determining a defendant violated a condition of supervised release, the district judge may revoke the term of supervision and impose a prison term after considering (1) the applicable Guidelines range, (2) the nature and circumstances of the crime with the history and characteristics of the defendant, (3) the need for the sentence imposed to afford adequate deterrence and protect the public, (4) the applicable Sentencing Commission policy statements, (5) the need to avoid unwarranted sentence disparities, and (6) the need to provide restitution. <em>See </em>18 U.S.C. \u00a7\u00a7 3553(a), 3583(e). A judge, however, must revoke a defendant\u2019s term of supervision and impose a prison term if the defendant possesses a controlled substance. <em>See </em>18 U.S.C. \u00a7 3583(g)(1); <em>United States v. Brown, </em>224 F.3d 1237, 1241-42 (11th Cir. 2000), <em>abrogated in part on other grounds as recognized in United States v. Vandergrift, </em>754 F.3d 1303, 1309 (11th Cir.2014). Unlike \u00a7 3583(e), which governs permissive release revocation, the subsection governing mandatory revocation, \u00a7 3583(g), does not require the judge to consider any of the \u00a7 3553(a) factors. <em>See </em>18 U.S.C. \u00a7 3583(e), (g); <em>Brown, </em>224 F.3d at 1242. A judge need not state specifically he is compelled to revoke supervised release under \u00a7 3583(g), if the conditions implicating the provision are present. <em>See Brown, </em>224 F.3d at 1242.</p>\n<p id=\"b834-9\">Because Temprano possessed a controlled substance, the district judge was not required to consult the \u00a7 3553(a) factors. <em>See </em>18 U.S.C. \u00a7 3583(e), (g); <em>Brown, </em>224 F.3d at 1242. Nevertheless, the judge erred by failing to give any explanation for his chosen sentences. <em>See Bonilla, </em>463 F.3d at 1181; <em>Veteto, </em>920 F.2d at 826. As in <em>Veteto, </em>the judge\u2019s statement here that a within-Guidelines sentence was \u201cappropriate,\u201d without more, \u201cis a truism and not an explanation.\u201d <em>Veteto, </em>920 F.2d at 826. Although the judge said without explanation <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"807\">*807</page-number>he had considered the parties\u2019 statements, he gave no reason for rejecting Temprano\u2019s request for a below-Guidelines sentence and the government\u2019s 24-month sentence recommendation. <em>See Rita, </em>551 U.S. at 357, 127 S.Ct. at 2468 (\u201cWhere the defendant or prosecutor presents nonfrivolous reasons for imposing a different sentence, ... the judge will normally go further and explain why he has rejected those arguments.\u201d). The judge\u2019s statement that he had considered the \u201cviolation report,\u201d R13 at 5-6, which appears to be a reference to the revocation petition, likewise was insufficient, because the revocation petition included no more than the facts showing Temprano\u2019s release violation, and the judge did not state why the fact of the violation, without more, justified the sentence imposed. Nor did the judge engage in any discussion with either party that would reveal his reasons for the chosen sentence. <em>See Rita, </em>551 U.S. at 344-45, 358-59, 127 S.Ct. at 2461-62, 2469 (concluding the record made clear the reasons underlying the judge\u2019s decision to impose a within-Guidelines sentence, where (1) each party and the judge engaged in colloquies regarding the defendant\u2019s request for a below-Guidelines sentence and the government\u2019s request for a within-Guidelines sentence; and (2) the judge stated \u201cthat he was \u2018unable to find that the [recommended] guideline range ... is an inappropriate guideline range for that, and under 3553 ... the public needs to be protected if it is true, and I must accept as true the jury[\u2019s guilty] verdict\u2019 \u201d).</p>\n<p id=\"b835-5\">The government\u2019s argument that Temprano\u2019s claim should be reviewed for plain error is refuted by <em>Bonilla, </em>which the government does not address. <em>See Bonilla, </em>463 F.3d at 1181. The district judge\u2019s cursory reference to the Sentencing Reform Act of 1984 after sentencing Temprano was insufficient to show the reasons for the sentences he imposed, specifically required for a sentence at a particular point within the Guidelines range exceeding 24 months. <em>See </em>18 U.S.C. \u00a7 3553(c)(1), <em>cross-referencing </em>18 U.S.C. \u00a7 3553(a)(4).<footnotemark>2</footnotemark></p>\n<p id=\"b835-9\">VACATED AND REMANDED.</p>\n<footnote label=\"1\">\n<p id=\"b833-8\">. It appears the judge\u2019s reference to a \"violation report\u201d was intended to refer to the petition to revoke supervised release, because no separate violation report appears on the district court dockets or in the record on appeal.</p>\n</footnote>\n<footnote label=\"2\">\n<p id=\"b835-6\">. In view of our conclusion that the district judge inadequately explained Temprano\u2019s sentences, we do not reach his challenge to the substantive reasonableness of his sentences.</p>\n</footnote>\n</opinion>\n</casebody>\n",
