Feb. 7, 2013). We assume the parties\u2019 familiarity with the underlying facts and procedural history in this case.</p>\n<p id=\"b96-9\">We review the BIA\u2019s denial of a motion to reopen for abuse of discretion, remaining mindful of the Supreme Court\u2019s admonition that such motions are \u201cdisfavored.\u201d <em>Ali v. Gonzales, </em>448 F.3d 515, 517 (2d Cir.2006) (citing <em>INS v. Doherty, </em>502 U.S. 314, 322-23, 112 S.Ct. 719, 116 L.Ed.2d 823 (1992)); <em>Kaur v. BIA, </em>413 F.3d 232, 233 (2d Cir.2005) (per curiam).</p>\n<p id=\"b96-10\">The BIA did not abuse its discretion in denying Lin\u2019s motion because he did not show his prima facie eligibility for relief. <em>See INS v. Abudu, </em>485 U.S. 94, 104-05, 108 S.Ct. 904, 99 L.Ed.2d 90 (1988) (a movant\u2019s failure to establish a prima facie case for the underlying substantive relief sought is a proper ground on which the BIA may deny a motion to reopen). In order to show that he had a well-founded fear of persecution on account of his practice of Falun Gong if he returned to China, Lin submitted: a letter from a friend in China which stated that Chinese police warned the friend that he and Lin \u201cmust not engage in illegal activity any more\u201d; an affidavit from his brother, which stated that on the brother\u2019s last visit to China from the United States, the police gave him a notice stating that they were aware Lin was illegally \u201cspread[ing] Falun Gong to the Chinese citizen\u201d and was required to surrender himself to the police if he returned to China; and the police notice itself. The BIA reasonably afforded this evidence minimal weight, as the police notice was- unsigned and unauthenticated, and the letter and affidavit were from interested witnesses. <em>See Xiao Ji Chen v. U.S. Dep\u2019t of Justice, </em>471 F.3d 315, 342 (2d Cir.2006) (the weight afforded to a movant\u2019s evidence lies largely within the discretion of the agency).</p>\n<p id=\"b96-12\">Furthermore, even taking these documents as proof that the Chinese government is aware of Lin\u2019s practice of Falun Gong, the police notice did not specify what, if any, penalties Lin would face as a result of his practice. As a result, the evidence does not demonstrate that Lin might face any harm rising to the level of persecution. <em>See Jian Hui Shao v. Mukasey, </em>546 F.3d 138, 172 (2d Cir.2008) (evidence of penalties or sanctions does not necessarily signal a reasonable possibility of persecution); <em>Ramsameachire v. Ashcroft, </em>357 F.3d 169, 178 (2d Cir.2004) (an alien\u2019s fear of future persecution must be objectively reasonable).</p>\n<p id=\"b96-13\">For the foregoing reasons, the petition for review is DENIED. As we have completed our review, any stay of removal that the Court previously granted in this petition is VACATED, and any pending motion for a stay of removal in this petition is <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"69\">*69</page-number>DISMISSED as moot. Any pending request for oral argument in this petition is DENIED in accordance with Federal Rule of Appellate Procedure 34(a)(2), and Second Circuit Local Rule 34.1(b).</p>\n</opinion>\n</casebody>\n",
