This case arose out of Appellees\u2019 alleged failure to pay minimum wages to Appellants as required by 29 U.S.C. \u00a7\u00a7 206(a) and 216(b) of the Fair Labor Standards Act (FLSA). The district court granted judgment as a matter of law because, based on the evidence at trial, no reasonable juror could conclude Appellees violated the FLSA. After careful review of the record, we affirm.<footnotemark>1</footnotemark></p>\n<p id=\"b861-11\">Appellants argue the evidence at trial was sufficient to trigger the FLSA\u2019s burden-shifting analysis because the Appellees\u2019 employment records were \u201cinaccurate and inadequate.\u201d <em>See Anderson v. Mt. Clemens Pottery Co., </em>328 U.S. 680, 687, 66 S.Ct. 1187, 90 L.Ed. 1515 (1946), <em>superceded by statute on other grounds as stated in Carter v. Panama Canal Co., </em>463 F.2d 1289, 1293 (D.C.Cir.1972). Appellants contend they needed to produce evidence showing only the amount of uncompensated work \u201cas a matter of just and reasonable inference,\u201d not evidence of the \u201cprecise amount of worked performed.\u201d <em>See Allen v. Bd. of Pub. Educ. for Bibb Cnty., </em>495 F.3d 1306, 1316 (11th Cir.2007).</p>\n<p id=\"b861-14\">We conclude Appellants failed to introduce \u201cmore than a mere scintilla of evidence,\u201d <em>Abel v. Dubberly, </em>210 F.3d 1334, 1337 (11th Cir.2000), suggesting the employment records were inaccurate. For example, Appellants rely on alleged inconsistencies between the sales commission sheets and the employee time calendar, as sales commissions were credited to Appellants\u2019 accounts on days when Appellants were calendared as not working. Appellants did not dispute, however, that sales commission dates reflected the day when the sale paperwork was completed, not when the salesperson initiated the sale. Appellants likewise failed to produce documentary evidence or state with specificity particular dates on which their actual work hours were not accurately reflected in the employer\u2019s records. In sum, no reasonable juror could conclude the evidence at trial was sufficient to trigger the FLSA\u2019s burden-shifting analysis.</p>\n<p id=\"b861-15\">Even assuming Appellants triggered the FLSA\u2019s burden-shifting analysis, Appellants failed to introduce sufficient evi<page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"834\">*834</page-number>dence supporting a \u201cjust and reasonable inference,\u201d <em>Allen, </em>495 F.3d at 1316, that they were compensated below the minimum wage. For instance, though Appellants testified they sometimes worked through automatically deducted lunch breaks, Appellants did not estimate the number of days on which they did not take a lunch. Similarly, Hinz testified he worked 52-54 hours per week and Gilson testified he worked 50-60 hours per week, but neither could recall the hours worked in any particular week. On this record, no reasonable juror could make a just and reasonable approximation of Appellants\u2019 undercompensated work hours.</p>\n<p id=\"b862-4\">In light of the foregoing, we conclude the district court did not err in granting the judgment as a matter of law to Appellees Indaglo, Inc. and Charles Henley.</p>\n<p id=\"b862-5\">AFFIRMED.</p>\n<footnote label=\"1\">\n<p id=\"b861-12\">. We review de novo a district court's grant of a Rule 50 motion for judgment as a matter of law, considering all evidence in the light most favorable to the non-moving party. <em>Mendoza v. Borden, Inc., </em>195 F.3d 1238, 1259 (11th Cir.1999) (en banc). To affirm a judgment as a matter of law, we must decide \"no reasonable juror could reach a contrary decision.\" <em>Carruthers v. BSA Adver., Inc., </em>357 F.3d 1213, 1215 (11th Cir.2004) (citation omitted). The non-movant must put forth \u201cmore than a mere scintilla of evidence suggesting that reasonable minds could reach differing verdicts.\u201d <em>Abel v. Dubberly, </em>210 F.3d 1334, 1337 (11th Cir.2000). \"Rather, there must be a substantial conflict in evidence to support a jury question.\u201d <em>Carter v. City of Miami, </em>870 F.2d 578, 581 (11th Cir. 1989).</p>\n</footnote>\n</opinion>\n</casebody>\n",
