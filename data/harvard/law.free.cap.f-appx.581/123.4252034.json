We have jurisdiction under 28 U.S.C. \u00a7 1291 and review the District Court\u2019s order for abuse of discretion. <em>United States v. Chambers, </em>192 F.3d 374, 376 (3d Cir.1999). For the reasons set forth below, we will vacate the District Court\u2019s order and remand for further proceedings.</p>\n<p id=\"b151-23\">In November 2009, a jury in the Eastern District of Pennsylvania found Green guilty of several offenses relating to access-device fraud and identity theft. The District Court sentenced him to 139 months\u2019 imprisonment and ordered the forfeiture of his Mercedes-Benz and $9,000. <em>United States v. Green, </em>516 Fed.Appx. 113, 117 (3d Cir.2013). This Court affirmed his conviction and sentence. <em>Id.</em></p>\n<p id=\"b151-24\">In the District Court, Green filed a counseled motion under Rule 41(g), seeking the return of two computers, a 2007 Dodge Charger, $4,000 in cash, personal papers, keys, printers, office equipment, a word processor, a typewriter, a driver\u2019s <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"124\">*124</page-number>license, a fax machine, a copy machine, credit cards, and clothes. In response, the Government asserted that it did not oppose \u201cthe return of any of the items of a non-criminal nature.\u201d However, the Government maintained that all items that had been seized from Green\u2019s apartment had been transferred to the United States Secret Service, that the 2007 Dodge Charger had been conveyed to the lien holder, and that it had never seized clothing or cash.</p>\n<p id=\"b152-4\">The District Court denied Green\u2019s motion without an evidentiary hearing. The Court accepted the Government\u2019s representation that it had \u201ceither returned to Green the items to which he was entitled, transferred the items to the Secret Service, or never possessed the items in the first place.\u201d Green then filed a timely notice of appeal to this Court.</p>\n<p id=\"b152-5\">On appeal, Green argues primarily that the District Court erred in denying his motion without holding a hearing or calling for additional evidence. The Government, exhibiting commendable candor, agrees. We likewise agree.</p>\n<p id=\"b152-6\">As we explained in <em>Chambers, </em>after the termination of criminal proceedings, \u201cthe person from whom the property was seized is presumed to have a right to its return, and the government must demonstrate that it has a legitimate reason to retain the property.\u201d 192 F.3d at 377. To carry its burden, \u201c[t]he government must do more than state, without documentary support, that it no longer possesses the property at issue.\u201d <em>Id. </em>at 377-78; <em>see also United States v. Albinson, </em>356 F.3d 278, 283 (3d Cir.2004) (\u201cAllowing the government to defeat a Rule 41(g) motion simply by asserting that it no longer retains possession of the property would frustrate the purpose of the Fed R. [Crim.] P. 41(g) evidentiary inquiry set forth in <em>Chambers.\u201d). </em>That standard was not satisfied here \u2014 instead, the District Court accepted the Government\u2019s unsupported assertions that it either never had or no longer possessed Green\u2019s property. Accordingly, we will vacate the District Court\u2019s order and remand for further proceedings.<footnotemark>1</footnotemark></p>\n<p id=\"b152-10\">However, we reject Green\u2019s argument that the case should be remanded to a different District Judge. We have emphasized that \u201creassignment is an extraordinary remedy that should seldom be employed,\u201d which will generally be appropriate only in cases \u201cinvolv[ing] apparent bias deriving from an extrajudicial source, meaning something above and beyond judicial rulings or opinions formed in presiding over the case.\u201d <em>United States v. Bergrin, </em>682 F.3d 261, 282 (3d Cir.2012). Green has failed altogether to make this showing.<footnotemark>2</footnotemark> <em>See, e.g., Azubuko v. Royal, </em>443 F.3d 302, 304 (3d Cir.2006) (per curiam).</p>\n<p id=\"b152-11\">Accordingly, we will vacate the District Court\u2019s order and remand for further proceedings consistent with this opinion.</p>\n<footnote label=\"*\">\n<p id=\"b151-26\"> This disposition is not an opinion of the full Court and pursuant to I.O.P. 5.7 does not constitute binding precedent.</p>\n</footnote>\n<footnote label=\"1\">\n<p id=\"b152-7\">. In its brief to this Court, the Government represents that, while this appeal has been pending, the Secret Service has released numerous items of property to Green. We will leave it to the District Court to determine in the first instance whether Green has received the items that he seeks or whether disputes remain.</p>\n</footnote>\n<footnote label=\"2\">\n<p id=\"b152-13\">. Green argues that we should bar the Government from participating in this appeal because it failed to object to his Rule 41(g) motion. However, his premise is wrong \u2014 -the government did in fact oppose his motion, as the District Court\u2019s order makes clear \u2014 and we will deny his request.</p>\n</footnote>\n</opinion>\n</casebody>\n",
