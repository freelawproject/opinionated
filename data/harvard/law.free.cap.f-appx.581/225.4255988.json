Martin\u2019s complaint alleged in part that on December 20, 2011, three prison officials entered his cell to conduct a search, one of whom masturbated in Martin\u2019s presence and used excessive force in restraining him (the \u201cDecember 20 incident\u201d). Martin raised claims of Eighth Amendment violations against the officers and several additional prison employees, as well as a claim of civil conspiracy. Martin appeals the district court\u2019s order adopting the magistrate judge\u2019s report and recommendation and granting summary judgment in favor of the Defendants. We affirm.</p>\n<p id=\"b253-24\">The magistrate judge, to whom the district court referred this case pursuant to 28 U.S.C. \u00a7 636(b)(1)(B) (2012), recommended that relief be denied and advised Martin that failure to file timely objections to this recommendation could waive appellate review of a district court order based upon the recommendation. Such timely filing of specific objections is necessary to preserve appellate review of the substance of that recommendation when the parties have been warned of the consequences of noncompliance. <em>Wright v. Collins, </em>766 F.2d 841, 845-46 (4th Cir.1985); <em>see also Thomas v. Arn, </em>474 U.S. 140, 155, 106 S.Ct. 466, 88 L.Ed.2d 435 (1985).</p>\n<p id=\"b253-25\">Martin\u2019s objections to the report and recommendation challenged the magistrate judge\u2019s failure to address his conspiracy <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"226\">*226</page-number>claim. Because Martin failed to specifically object to the magistrate judge\u2019s recommendation regarding the remainder of his claims after receiving notice of the consequences for failure to do so, he has waived appellate review of such claims. <em>See In re Under Seal, </em>749 F.3d 276, 287 (4th Cir. 2014) (\u201c[A]n objection on one ground does not preserve objections based on different grounds.\u201d (internal quotation marks omitted)).</p>\n<p id=\"b254-4\">On appeal, Martin again challenges the district court\u2019s dismissal of his conspiracy claim. \u201cTo establish a civil conspiracy under \u00a7 1983, Appellant[ ] must present evidence that the Appellees acted jointly in concert and that some overt act was done in furtherance of the conspiracy which resulted in Appellant[\u2019s] deprivation of a constitutional right....\u201d <em>Hinkle v. City of Clarksburg, </em>81 F.3d 416, 421 (4th Cir. 1996). This is a \u201cweighty burden.\u201d <em>Id. </em>Furthermore, the factual allegations must amount \u201cto more than rank speculation and conjecture\u201d and must \u201cgive rise to an inference that each alleged conspirator shared the same conspiratorial objective.\u201d <em>Id. </em>at 422. We agree with the district court that Martin\u2019s allegations fail to meet these standards, and therefore affirm its resolution of the claim.</p>\n<p id=\"b254-5\">Accordingly, we affirm the district court\u2019s order granting summary judgment in favor of the Defendants. We dispense with oral argument because the facts and legal contentions are adequately presented in the materials before this court and argument would not aid the decisional process.</p>\n<p id=\"b254-6\">\n<em>AFFIRMED.</em>\n</p>\n</opinion>\n</casebody>\n",
