Because Hornbuckle has not addressed the reasons for the district court\u2019s dismissal of her action, she has abandoned any challenge to that decision. <em>See Brinkmann v. Dallas Cnty. Deputy Sheriff Abner, </em>813 F.2d 744, 748 (5th Cir.1987).</p>\n<p id=\"b375-24\">Hornbuckle also appeals the district court\u2019s imposition of sanctions. A court\u2019s invocation of its inherent power to impose <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"348\">*348</page-number>sanctions should be confined to instances of \u201cbad faith or willful abuse of the judicial process.\u201d <em>In re Moore, </em>739 F.3d 724, 729 (5th Cir.2014) (internal quotation marks and citation omitted). In light of Horn-buckle\u2019s repetitive filings challenging the same subject matter, her actions met this standard, and the district court\u2019s $500 sanction did not constitute an abuse of discretion. <em>Id. </em>at 729-30. Accordingly, we AFFIRM the district court\u2019s judgment.</p>\n<p id=\"b376-4\">This court has previously warned Horn-buckle that \u201crepetitive filings of frivolous claims regarding the same subject matter constitutes abuse of judicial process\u201d and could result in sanctions. <em>See Hornbuckle v. Massachusetts Mut. Life Ins. Co., </em>399 Fed.Appx. 863, 865 (5th Cir.2010). Because Hornbuckle has not heeded this warning and has failed to brief any challenge to the reasons for the district court\u2019s dismissal of her instant action, a monetary SANCTION of $500 payable to the clerk of this court is IMPOSED. IT IS FURTHER ORDERED that Hornbuckle is BARRED from filing in this court or any court subject to this court\u2019s jurisdiction any pleadings until the sanction is paid in full, unless she first obtains leave of the court in which she seeks to file her pleadings. Hornbuckle is WARNED that any future frivolous or repetitive filings regarding the same subject matter will subject her to additional and progressively more severe sanctions, as will the failure to withdraw any pending matters that are frivolous.</p>\n<footnote label=\"*\">\n<p id=\"b375-25\"> Pursuant to 5th Cir. R. 47.5, the court has determined that this opinion should not be published and is not precedent except under the limited circumstances set forth in 5th Cir. R. 47.5.4.</p>\n</footnote>\n</opinion>\n</casebody>\n",
