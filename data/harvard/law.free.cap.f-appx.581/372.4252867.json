This Court reviews de novo a district court\u2019s dismissal based on <em>res judicata. See Turner v. Pleasant, </em>663 F.3d 770, 775 (5th Cir.2011). Rulings on motions to amend, motions to transfer venue, and motions for recusal are reviewed for abuse of discretion. <em>E.g., Wilson v. Bruks-Klockner, Inc., </em>602 F.3d 363, 368 (5th Cir.2010) (\u201cIn general, we review a district court\u2019s denial of leave to amend for abuse of discretion.\u201d); <em>Broussard v. State Farm Fire &amp; Cas. Co., </em>523 F.3d 618, 631 (5th Cir.2008) (\u201cThis [Court] reviews the district court\u2019s venue rulings for abuse of discretion.\u201d); <em>Trevino v. Johnson, </em>168 F.3d 173, 178 (5th Cir.1999) (reviewing denial of recusal motion for abuse of discretion).</p>\n<p id=\"b400-19\">Boswell does not challenge the district court\u2019s reasons for dismissing his complaint or for denying his various motions. Although pro se briefs are liberally construed, pro se appellants must brief the issues and reasonably comply with the requirements of Rule 28 of the Federal Rules of Appellate Procedure. <em>E.g., Grant v. Cuellar, </em>59 F.3d 523, 524 (5th Cir.1995) (per curiam); <em>Yohey v. Collins, </em>985 F.2d 222, 224-25 (5th Cir.1993). When an appellant does not identify error in the district court\u2019s analysis, it is the same as if the appellant had not appealed that issue. <em>Brinkmann v. Dall. Cnty. Deputy Sheriff Abner, </em>813 F.2d 744, 748 (5th Cir.1987). Because Boswell does not argue that it was error for the district court to have used <em>res judicata </em>as a basis for dismissing his complaint, or that it was an abuse of discretion to deny any of his motions, the issues are deemed abandoned. <em>See id. </em>at 748; <em>see also Yohey, </em>985 F.2d at 225 (addressing only those arguments briefed and, thus, preserved on appeal by pro se <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"373\">*373</page-number>appellant). The judgment of the district court is AFFIRMED.</p>\n<footnote label=\"*\">\n<p id=\"b400-17\"> Pursuant to 5th Cir. R. 47.5, the court has determined that this opinion should not be published and is not precedent except under the limited circumstances set forth in 5th Cir. R. 47.5.4.</p>\n</footnote>\n</opinion>\n</casebody>\n",
