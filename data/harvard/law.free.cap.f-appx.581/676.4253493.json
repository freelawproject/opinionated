Hernandez-Velazquez asserts the district court violated his Sixth Amendment right to counsel when it permitted him to proceed <em>pro se </em>without ensuring that his waiver of his right to counsel was \u201cknowing and intelligent.\u201d We review the validity of a waiver of a defendant\u2019s right to counsel de novo, <em>United States v. Forrester, </em>512 F.3d 500, 506 (9th Cir.2008), and affirm.</p>\n<p id=\"b704-23\">\u201c[T]o deem a defendant\u2019s <em>Faretta </em>waiver knowing and intelligent, the district court must insure that [the defendant] understands 1) the nature of the charges against him, 2) the possible penalties, and 3) the dangers and disadvantages of self-representation.\u201d <em>Id. </em>(internal quotation marks omitted). On appeal, Hernandez-Velazquez concedes that \u201cthe district court convincingly and thoroughly warned [him] about the dangers of self-representation.\u201d However, Hernandez-Velazquez argues that his waiver of counsel was not \u201cknowing and intelligent\u201d because the district court failed to inform him of the nature of the charges against him and the possible penalties. We disagree.</p>\n<p id=\"b704-24\">\u201c[A]lthough it is \u2018only the rare case in which an adequate waiver will be found on the record in the absence of a specific inquiry by the trial judge,\u2019 the failure of the district court to engage in a colloquy with the defendant cannot itself be reversible error.\u201d <em>United States v. Gerritsen, </em>571 F.3d 1001, 1008 (9th Cir.2009) (quoting <em>United States v. Balough, </em>820 F.2d 1485, 1488 (9th Cir.1987)). Rather, when the district court has not made an adequate waiver inquiry, the \u201cdefendant\u2019s waiver must be evaluated in light of the record as a whole.\u201d <em>Id. </em>\u201cThroughout this inquiry, we must focus on what the defendant understood, rather than on what the court said or understood.\u201d <em>Balough, </em>820 F.2d at 1487-88.</p>\n<p id=\"b705-4\"><page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"677\">*677</page-number>At Hernandez-Velazquez\u2019s April 2011 arraignment, the magistrate judge informed Hernandez-Velazquez that \u201cthere\u2019s an indictment filed with this Court which charges you with three counts of a violation of Title 18, Section 2251(a). Each \u2014 if you are convicted of that offense, each of the counts is punishable by as many as 30 years in custody, and a fine of as much as $250,000.\u201d Hernandez-Velazquez\u2019s attorney waived further reading of the indictment, but noted that, in fact, \u201cthere are four counts with a mandatory minimum of 15 [years] on each.\u201d Further, Hernandez-Velazquez admitted that he received two plea offers which stated that he had been charged with \u201c[flour separate counts of Sexual Exploitation of a Minor (Production of Child Pornography), in violation of Title 18, United States Code, Section 2251(a)\u201d and listed the elements for this crime. When asked by the district court if he \u201ckn[e]w clearly what those plea offers were,\u201d Hernandez-Velazquez responded, \u2018Tes.\u201d Based on the transcript of the April 2011 arraignment and the two plea offers, we conclude that Hernandez-Velazquez understood both the nature of the charges against him and the possible penalties. We therefore hold that Hernandez-Velazquez \u201cknowingly and intelligently\u201d waived his right to counsel.</p>\n<p id=\"b705-5\">AFFIRMED.</p>\n<footnote label=\"**\">\n<p id=\"b704-25\"> This disposition is not appropriate for publication and is not precedent except as provided by 9th Cir.
