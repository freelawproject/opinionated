(\u201cBGI\u201d) appeals the district court\u2019s grant of summary judgment to American General Life Insurance Company (\u201cAG\u201d) on BGI\u2019s action alleging, among other things, breach of contract and breach of the covenant of good faith and fair dealing stemming from AG\u2019s refusal to reinstate a BGI-owned life insurance policy (\u201cthe Policy\u201d) <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"632\">*632</page-number>held by Sameha Rajab. We have jurisdiction under 28 U.S.C. \u00a7 1291. We affirm the district court on all claims and theories except one: the district court did not address BGI\u2019s argument that AG breached the contract when BGI did not receive a contractually-required notice that the Policy was in its grace period and would lapse upon continued non-payment of premiums. We vacate and remand summary judgment on that point alone, and we retain jurisdiction over any further appeal.</p>\n<p id=\"b660-4\">I</p>\n<p id=\"b660-5\">The Policy lapsed for non-payment of premiums in February 2009. AG initially denied BGI\u2019s application for reinstatement in light of Rajab\u2019s \u201chealth history and the admitted fact she had not followed-up with a physician since March 2006,\u201d but offered to reconsider its decision if given further information. AG formally declined to reinstate the Policy after BGI provided evidence only that Rajab had seen a doctor more recently than 2006.</p>\n<p id=\"b660-6\">To prevail on its claim that AG breached the contract by refusing to reinstate the Policy, BGI must show (1) evidence of insurability satisfactory to AG, and (2) that AG\u2019s denial of reinstatement was arbitrary or capricious. <em>See Ryman v. Am. Nat\u2019l Ins. Co., 5 </em>Cal.3d 620, 96 Cal.Rptr. 728, 488 P.2d 32, 40 (1971). It can do neither.</p>\n<p id=\"b660-7\">BGI produced virtually no evidence of Rajab\u2019s insurability, and certainly not enough to satisfy the reasonable insurer. See <em>id. </em>Before formally declining to reinstate the Policy, AG warned BGI of its concerns about Rajab\u2019s insurability; it also told BGI it was planning to deny reinstatement multiple times. The one-page note indicating that Rajab had visited a doctor at least once in the past three years was not enough to satisfy AG\u2019s concerns. That is a problem of BGI\u2019s own creation.</p>\n<p id=\"b660-8\">Nor was AG\u2019s decision to deny reinstatement arbitrary or capricious. Given Rajab\u2019s age and history of serious medical problems, it was not unreasonable for AG to have concerns about her insurability. AG\u2019s analysis of \u2014 and decision to deny \u2014 the reinstatement application was objectively reasonable and in compliance with both the Policy and California law. Further, there is no evidence that the decision to deny reinstatement was made in bad faith. AG did not breach the covenant of good faith and fair dealing.</p>\n<p id=\"b660-9\">II</p>\n<p id=\"b660-10\">Alternatively, BGI argues that American General breached when it did not mail a contractually-required notice that the Policy was in its grace period and would lapse upon continued non-payment of premiums. The parties submitted conflicting evidence regarding their bookkeeping procedures for sending and receiving mail, but the district court\u2019s summary judgment order contains no analysis of BGI\u2019s grace period notice theory. Accordingly, we cannot discern the reasoning of the district court on this point and decline to rule definitively on it. <em>See Sheehan v. City &amp; Cnty. of S.F., </em>743 F.3d 1211, 1234 (9th Cir.2014) (\u201c[W]e decline to address the defendants\u2019 alternative arguments because they have not been passed upon by the district court.\u201d).</p>\n<p id=\"b660-11\">Because there is no formal, signed pretrial order, we cannot tell if the district court\u2019s comments at the August 8, 2011, pretrial conference were meant to limit BGI\u2019s breach of contract claim to the denial of reinstatement by striking the grace period notice argument as an issue to be tried. We cannot tell if the district court granted summary judgment to AG in part because it concluded that BGI\u2019s grace period notice theory was not fairly presented by the pleadings. We cannot tell if the <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"633\">*633</page-number>district court concluded that there was no dispute as to any material fact regarding the mailing of the grace period notice, despite BGI\u2019s testimony to the contrary. We cannot tell if some other issue relating to the grace period notice motivated the district court\u2019s grant of summary judgment.</p>\n<p id=\"b661-5\">Because the record is ambiguous as to whether the district court intended to grant summary judgment to AG on BGI\u2019s grace period notice theory, and as to whether the district court considered that theory fairly presented by the pleadings, we vacate and remand the district court\u2019s grant of summary judgment to AG on that point alone. <em>See Senger v. United States, </em>103 F.3d 1437, 1444 (9th Cir.1996). We do so to permit the district court (1) to hold whatever proceedings it thinks may be helpful, and (2) to give its reasoning with respect to BGI\u2019s grace period notice theory in the first instance.</p>\n<p id=\"b661-6\">This panel retains jurisdiction over any future appeal on this matter.</p>\n<p id=\"b661-7\">Each party shall bear its own costs on appeal.</p>\n<p id=\"b661-8\">AFFIRMED IN PART, VACATED IN PART, AND REMANDED.</p>\n<footnote label=\"***\">\n<p id=\"b659-22\"> This disposition is not appropriate for publication and is not precedent except as provided by Ninth Circuit Rule 36-3.</p>\n</footnote>\n</opinion>\n</casebody>\n",
