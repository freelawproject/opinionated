On appeal, the Director argues that the district court erred in determining \u201cjust and proper\u201d temporary relief under this provision, specifically by (1) denying the Director\u2019s request for an interim bargaining order pending the outcome of administrative proceedings before the National Labor Relations Board, and (2) setting out procedures for awarding backpay to an employee discharged by respondent-appellee Hogan Transports, Inc. (\u201cHogan\u201d). We assume the parties\u2019 familiarity with the underlying facts, procedural history, and specification of issues for review.</p>\n<p id=\"b64-17\">\u201cIn this Circuit, in order to issue a \u00a7 10(j) injunction, the district court must apply a two-prong test. First, the court must find reasonable cause to believe that unfair labor practices have been committed. Second, the court must find that the requested relief is just and proper.\u201d <em>Hoff</em><page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"37\">*37</page-number><em>man ex rel. NLRB v. Inn Credible Caterers, Ltd., </em>247 F.3d 360, 364-65 (2d Cir. 2001). In this appeal, only the second prong is at issue. The district court found \u201creasonable cause to believe that unfair labor practices have been committed [by Hogan],\u201d <em>id. </em>at 365, based on the contentions in the Director\u2019s petition, which were \u201clargely unchallenged\u201d in the proceedings below. Neither party has argued on appeal that this finding was erroneous. Therefore, we take the district court\u2019s \u201creasonable cause\u201d determination as given in assessing its \u201cjust and proper\u201d analysis.</p>\n<p id=\"b65-5\">\u201cIn this Circuit, injunctive relief under \u00a7 10(j) is just and proper when it is necessary to prevent irreparable harm or to preserve the status quo.\u201d <em>Id. </em>at 368. \u201cWe review the district court\u2019s determination of whether relief is just and proper for abuse of discretion, bearing in mind ... that a judge\u2019s discretion is not boundless and must be exercised within the applicable rules of law or equity.\u201d <em>Id. </em>at 364 (internal citation and quotation marks omitted). A district court abuses its discretion \u201cwhen (1) its decision rests on an error of law (such as application of the wrong legal principle) or a clearly erroneous factual finding, or (2) its decision \u2014 though not necessarily the product of a legal error or a clearly erroneous factual finding \u2014 cannot be located within the range of permissible decisions.\u201d <em>In re Holocaust Victim Assets Litig., </em>424 F.3d 158, 165 (2d Cir.2005) (internal quotation marks omitted).</p>\n<p id=\"b65-6\">Although \u201cthe issuance of a bargaining order by a district court ... is, undoubtedly, a serious measure which should not be undertaken whenever a claim of unfair labor practices is made,\u201d we have held \u201cthat when the Regional Director makes a showing, based on authorization cards, that the union at one point had a clear majority and that the employer then engaged in such egregious and coercive unfair labor practices as to make a fair election virtually impossible, the district court <em>should </em>issue a bargaining order under \u00a7 10(j).\u201d <em>Seeler v. Trading Port, Inc., </em>517 F.2d 33, 40 (2d Cir.1975) (emphasis added).</p>\n<p id=\"b65-8\">Here, the district court summarily concluded that an interim bargaining order \u201cgoes too far, and is unnecessary to prevent irreparable harm\u201d because \u201c[t]he relief that the court imposes sufficiently and equitably addresses the issues raised herein \u2014 including making a fair election possible \u2014 and is just and proper.\u201d This abbreviated analysis, even when viewed in the context of the preceding hearing, leaves us unable to assess whether the district court actually grappled with the seriousness of the violations it found \u201creasonable cause to believe ... ha[d] been committed.\u201d <em>Hoffman, </em>247 F.3d at 365. Therefore we vacate the district court\u2019s denial of the interim bargaining order and remand for further explanation of this decision.</p>\n<p id=\"b65-9\">The district court found reasonable cause to believe that Hogan, inter alia, (1) discharged an employee because of his support for the union; (2) threatened employees with job loss if they selected the union as their bargaining representative; and (3) promised and granted a wage increase in order to dissuade employees from supporting the union. In the context of final relief awarded by the NLRB administrative process, we have previously categorized all three of these unfair labor practices as \u201challmark\u201d violations. <em>See NLRB v. Jamaica Towing, Inc., </em>632 F.2d 208, 212-13 (2d Cir.1980). While \u201cthe presence of hallmark violations does not automatically call for a bargaining order\u201d in an NLRB administrative proceeding, <em>NLRB v. J. Coty Messenger Serv., Inc., </em>763 F.2d 92, 99 (2d Cir.1985), we have recognized such violations are \u201chighly coercive\u201d in the absence of mitigating factors such as the specific nature of the miscon<page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"38\">*38</page-number>duct, the passage of time, or employee turnover, <em>id.; see also NLRB v. Windsor Indus., </em>730 F.2d 860, 867 (2d Cir.1984) (\u201c[T]he lapse of time, employee turnover[,] and other significant factors must be examined.\u201d). Given its finding of several highly coercive unfair labor practices, and the absence of any discussion of any mitigating circumstances, the district court\u2019s analysis leaves unanswered the question of <em>why </em>an interim bargaining order is inappropriate here.</p>\n<p id=\"b66-4\">At most, the district court\u2019s analysis suggests it believed its chosen remedies were sufficient to combat the \u201challmark\u201d violations it found reasonable cause to believe had occurred, and ensure a fair election. Yet, in the absence of more detailed reasoning, we also have concerns about this conclusion. \u201c[S]ection 10(j) was intended as a means of preserving <em>or restoring </em>the status quo as it existed before the onset of unfair labor practices.\u201d <em>Seeler, </em>517 F.2d at 38 (emphasis added). We have previously cautioned that in the context of serious violations, cease and desist orders, standing alone, are insufficient to restore the pre-violation status quo. <em>See id. </em>at 37-38 (\u201cIf an employer faced with a union demand for recognition based on a card majority may engage in an extensive campaign of serious and pervasive unfair labor practices, resulting in the union\u2019s losing an election, and is then merely enjoined from repeating those already successful violations until final Board action is taken, the Board\u2019s adjudicatory machinery may well be rendered totally ineffective.\u201d). To be sure, the district court afforded some affirmative relief, reinstating on an interim basis an employee purportedly discharged for his union support. Yet this interim relief leaves entirely unaddressed the two other serious violations the district court found reasonable cause to believe had occurred here. In light of this unexplained disconnect between the harm found by the district court and the interim remedy imposed, we believe further explication on the \u201cjust and proper\u201d relief here is necessary. Without additional explanation, these remedies appear inadequate to restore the pre-violation status quo, \u201cfreez[ing] the present situation,\u201d rather than \u201cre-establish[ing] the conditions as they existed before the employer\u2019s unlawful campaign.\u201d <em>Id. </em>at 38 (internal quotation marks omitted).</p>\n<p id=\"b66-6\">On remand, the district court is free to revise its decision or again conclude that an interim bargaining order is not \u201cjust and proper\u201d relief pursuant to Section 10(j). However, in order to appropriately exercise its discretion, the district court should explain, beyond simply stating that an interim bargaining order \u201cgoes too far,\u201d why such relief is warranted or unwarranted in light of the serious violations it found, and the apparent disconnect between these violations and the other interim relief afforded. In addition, \u201c[o]n remand, the district court should consider not only the transcript of the hearing which was before the court at the time of its initial decision, but also the findings which have since been made by the administrative law judge.\u201d <em>Id. </em>at 40 n. 11. The district court may also consider the time the NLRB might take to resolve this matter, and it may seek reasonable assurances of timely disposition.</p>\n<p id=\"b66-7\">In addition, we vacate the portion of the district court\u2019s order requiring the ALJ to retain jurisdiction over this case for the purpose of determining the backpay sum to a discharged employee, and ordering Hogan to escrow and remit backpay amounts to the Director. In this portion of the order, the district court awarded an individual employee a portion of his final relief for the allegedly unfair labor practices committed by Hogan. In so doing, \u201c[t]he district court misidentifie[d] the <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"39\">*39</page-number>proper plaintiff in \u00a7 10(j) cases as the individual employees rather than the Regional Director.\u201d <em>Hoffman, </em>247 F.3d at 369; <em>see also Seeler, </em>517 F.2d at 40 (\u201c[S]ection 10(j) should be applied in the public interest and not in vindication of purely private rights, so as to further the policies of the Act.\u201d) (internal quotation marks omitted). Hogan argues that by providing a means of obtaining backpay for a discharged employee, the district court was attempting to increase the employee\u2019s willingness to return to work, and thus mitigate the coercive effects of his discharge. Yet neither the district court\u2019s opinion nor anything else in the record provides support for this inference. Moreover, even if this were true, the provision of final relief in the form of backpay exceeds the district court\u2019s authority under Section 10(j), which only provides a district court \u201cjurisdiction to grant to the Board such <em>temporary </em>relief or restraining order as it deems just and proper.\u201d 29 U.S.C. \u00a7 160(j) (emphasis added).</p>\n<p id=\"b67-5\">In light of the district court\u2019s sparse explanation for the denial of the interim bargaining order, the seeming seriousness of the violations at issue, and the apparent disconnect between the district court\u2019s chosen remedies and these violations, we believe further explanation is necessary regarding why an interim bargaining order is not \u201cjust and proper\u201d relief pursuant to Section 10(j). Therefore, we vacate the portion of the district court\u2019s order denying this request and remand for further consideration. In addition, we vacate the portion of the district court\u2019s order establishing procedures for an award of backpay to a discharged employee, as the district court inappropriately awarded an individual employee a portion of his final relief for the unfair labor practices at issue. We have considered the remainder of the parties\u2019 arguments and find them to be without merit. Accordingly, the judgment of the district court hereby is VACATED IN PART and this case is REMANDED for further proceedings consistent with this order.</p>\n</opinion>\n</casebody>\n",
