Count 7 of the indictment alleged that the bank which Mr. Zackery robbed \u2014 a First Union Bank in Clearwater, Florida \u2014 was insured by the Federal Deposit Insurance Corporation. At the change of plea hearing, the government, in providing the factual basis for Count 7, stated that First Union Bank was insured by the FDIC at the time of the robbery. Mr. Zackery agreed with the government\u2019s factual proffer.</p>\n<p id=\"b856-16\">Mr. Zackery did not appeal his conviction or sentence. Instead, he filed a motion to vacate under 28 U.S.C. \u00a7 2255 in 2011. The district court dismissed the motion, ruling in relevant part that it was time-barred. The district court denied Mr. Zackery a certificate of appealability, and so did we.</p>\n<p id=\"b856-18\">In October of 2013, Mr. Zackery filed a motion alleging that the district court lacked jurisdiction over Count 7 of the indictment because First Union Bank was not FDIC-insured at the time of the robbery. In essence, Mr. Zackery attacked his convictions on Count 7 and Count 8 (which was in part based on Count 7). The district court denied Mr. Zackery\u2019s motion on a number of grounds, and Mr. Zackery now appeals. Following review of the parties\u2019 briefs and the record, we affirm.</p>\n<p id=\"b856-19\">Given that Mr. Zackery was seeking to set aside his convictions on Counts 7 and 8, his 2013 motion constituted a second or successive \u00a7 2255 motion to vacate. In order to file a second or successive \u00a7 2255 motion, Mr. Zackery had to first obtain authorization from the Eleventh Circuit. <em>See </em>28 U.S.C. \u00a7 2255(h). Because he did not obtain such authorization, the district court correctly held that it \u201clack[ed] jurisdiction to consider\u201d Mr. Zackery\u2019s 2013 motion. <em>Farris v. United States, </em>333 F.3d 1211, 1216 (11th Cir.2003).</p>\n<p id=\"b856-20\">The motion, moreover, could not be considered under Rule 12(b)(3)(B) of the Federal Rules of Criminal Procedure, as Mr. Zackery\u2019s criminal case was no longer pending in the district court at the time the motion was filed. <em>See United States v. Elso, </em>571 F.3d 1163, 1166 (11th Cir.2009). The district court\u2019s order of dismissal is affirmed.</p>\n<p id=\"b856-21\">AFFIRMED.</p>\n</opinion>\n</casebody>\n",
