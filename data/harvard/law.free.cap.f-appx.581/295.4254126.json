The district court granted summary judgment against Williams as to all claims, but it granted a certificate of appealability as to one claim: that trial counsel was ineffective in failing to move for a mistrial or a hearing following a juror\u2019s request to be excused from the jury. On appeal, Williams challenges the district court\u2019s denial of relief on that claim without an evidentiary hearing. For the reasons that follow, we affirm.</p>\n<p id=\"b324-4\">A federal court may grant habeas corpus relief on a claim adjudicated on the merits by a state court only if the state court\u2019s ruling was either (1) \u201ccontrary to, or involved an unreasonable application of, clearly established Federal law, as determined by the Supreme Court,\u201d or (2) \u201cbased on an unreasonable determination of the facts in light of the evidence presented in the State court proceedings.\u201d 28 U.S.C. \u00a7 2254(d). We review for abuse of discretion the decision to deny an evidentiary hearing in a \u00a7 2254 proceeding. <em>Wolfe v. Johnson, </em>565 F.8d 140, 160 (4th Cir.2009).</p>\n<p id=\"b324-5\">We have recognized that a habeas petitioner</p>\n<blockquote id=\"b324-6\">who has diligently pursued his habeas corpus claim in state court is entitled to an evidentiary hearing in federal court, on facts not previously developed in the state court proceedings, if the facts alleged would entitle him to relief, and if he satisfies one of the six factors enumerated by the Supreme Court in <em>Townsend v. Sain, </em>372 U.S. 293, 313, 83 S.Ct. 745, 9 L.Ed.2d 770 (1963).</blockquote>\n<p id=\"b324-7\"><em>Wolfe, </em>565 F.3d at 168 (internal quotation marks omitted); <em>see Townsend, </em>372 U.S. at 313, 83 S.Ct. 745 (listing factors). In making this determination, the reviewing court evaluates the petition under the standards applicable to a Fed.R.Civ.P. 12(b)(6) motion to dismiss. <em>Conaway v. Polk, </em>453 F.3d 567, 582 (4th Cir.2006); <em>see Bell Atl. Corp. v. Twombly, </em>550 U.S. 544, 555, 570, 127 S.Ct. 1955, 167 L.Ed.2d 929 (2007) (stating Rule 12(b)(6) standard).</p>\n<p id=\"b324-9\">On appeal, Williams does not allege that the facts presented to the district court relative to the motion for summary judgment entitle him to habeas relief. Nor does he fairly challenge the district court\u2019s consideration of his claim under \u00a7 2254(d)\u2019s deferential standard of review. Rather, he argues that the district court erred in failing to hold an evidentiary hearing, as he has both alleged facts which, if true, are sufficient to warrant habeas relief and met several <em>Townsend </em>factors. By way of relief, he seeks only a remand to the district court for an evidentiary hearing.</p>\n<p id=\"b324-10\">Even assuming Williams can meet the <em>Townsend </em>test, however, he faces another hurdle to his request for a hearing. The Supreme Court has held that \u201c[i]f a claim has been adjudicated on the merits by a state court, a federal habeas petitioner must overcome the limitation of \u00a7 2254(d)(1) on the record that was before that state court.\u201d <em>Cullen v. Pinholster, </em>\u2014 U.S. -, 131 S.Ct. 1388, 1400, 179 L.Ed.2d 557 (2011). In such a circumstance, any evidentiary hearing in federal court is unwarranted, as new evidence adduced during such a hearing could not be considered in making the determination under \u00a7 2254(d)(1). <em>Id. </em>at 1399-400.</p>\n<p id=\"b324-13\">We have reviewed the record and submissions of the parties and conclude that the district court properly determined that the state court adjudicated Williams\u2019 claim on the merits. <em>See Winston v. Pearson, </em>683 F.3d 489, 502 (4th Cir.2012). Thus, under <em>Pinholster, </em>Williams is not entitled to adduce evidence to support a claim under \u00a7 2254(d)(1). Moreover, under \u00a7 2254(d)(2), the court may only grant habeas relief when the state court\u2019s factual determination was unreasonable \u201cin light <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"297\">*297</page-number>of the evidence presented in the State court proceeding.\u201d Any new evidence presented at an evidentiary hearing would not entitle Williams to relief on his claim under \u00a7 2254(d)(2).</p>\n<p id=\"b325-5\">Because Williams is not entitled to the only relief he seeks on appeal, we affirm the district court\u2019s judgment. We deny Williams\u2019 motion for appointment of counsel. We dispense with oral argument because the facts and legal contentions are adequately presented in the materials before this court and argument would not aid the decisional process.</p>\n<p id=\"b325-6\">\n<em>AFFIRMED.</em>\n</p>\n<footnote label=\"*\">\n<p id=\"b323-9\"> The North Carolina Superior Court has since vacated Williams\u2019 death sentence and imposed a sentence of life imprisonment, on grounds unrelated to this appeal.</p>\n</footnote>\n</opinion>\n</casebody>\n",
