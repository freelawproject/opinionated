He was sentenced to a within-guidelines sentence of 121 months of imprisonment and a lifetime term of supervised release. On appeal, Hatton argues that his sentence is procedurally and substantively unreasonable.</p>\n<p id=\"b403-21\">Generally, an appellate court reviews a district court\u2019s sentencing decision for reasonableness. <em>Gall v. United States, </em>552 U.S. 38, 51, 128 S.Ct. 586, 169 L.Ed.2d 445 (2007). When a defendant raises an issue on appeal that he did not raise in the district court, however, review is limited to plain error. <em>See Puckett v. United States, </em>556 U.S. 129, 134-35, 129 S.Ct. 1423, 173 L.Ed.2d 266 (2009). To show plain error, the defendant must show a forfeited error that is clear or obvious and that affects his substantial rights. <em>See id. </em>at 135, 129 S.Ct. 1423. If he makes such a showing, this court may exercise its discretion to correct the error but only if it seriously affects the fairness, integrity, or public reputation of judicial proceedings. <em>See id.</em></p>\n<p id=\"b403-22\">Hatton first contends that his sentence is procedurally unreasonable because the district court improperly presumed that the Guidelines were mandatory because they were mandated by Congress and improperly enhanced his sentence. Contrary to Hatton\u2019s contentions, the district court specifically recognized that the guidelines were advisory, and based on the unrebutted information contained in Hatton\u2019s presentence report, he has not shown that the district court plainly erred when it determined that a five-level enhancement pursuant to U.S.S.G. \u00a7 2G2.2(b)(7)(D) based on the number of images involved in the offense was warranted. <em>See </em>\u00a7 2G2.2(b)(7)(D), comment, (n. 4(B)(ii)); <em>United States v. Angulo, </em>927 F.2d 202, 205 (5th Cir.1991); <em>see also United States v. Zuniga, </em>720 F.3d 587, 591 (5th Cir.2013).</p>\n<p id=\"b403-23\">Next, Hatton contends that his prison and supervised release sentences are substantively unreasonable. The district court did not err in rejecting Hatton\u2019s <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"376\">*376</page-number>various policy arguments assailing \u00a7 2G2.2, including that \u00a7 2G2.2 deserves no deference because it lacks empirical support. <em>See United States v. Miller, </em>665 F.3d 114, 120-21 (5th Cir.2011). Also, the record reveals that, when determining Hatton\u2019s sentences, the district court reviewed, listened to, and considered Hat-ton\u2019s arguments and allocution and considered the advisory sentencing guidelines range, the Sentencing Guidelines, the policy statements of the Sentencing Guidelines, and the sentencing factors of 18 U.S.C. \u00a7 3553(a). Hatton has not rebutted the presumption that his within guidelines sentences are reasonable. <em>See United States v. Campos-Maldonado, </em>531 F.3d 337, 338-39 (5th Cir.2008); <em>United States v. Cooks, </em>589 F.3d 173, 186 (5th Cir.2009).</p>\n<p id=\"b404-4\">Accordingly, the judgment of the district court is AFFIRMED.</p>\n<footnote label=\"*\">\n<p id=\"b403-19\"> Pursuant to 5th Cir. R. 47.5, the court has determined that this opinion should not be published and is not precedent except under the limited circumstances set forth in 5th Cir. R. 47.5.4.</p>\n</footnote>\n</opinion>\n</casebody>\n",
