He argues the BIA erred by: ruling that he did not establish past persecution on account of imputed political opinion; determining that the record contains sufficient evidence of changed country conditions to overcome any presumption of future persecution; determining that he failed to establish eligibility for relief under the CAT; and denying him asylum on humanitarian grounds. We have jurisdiction under 8 U.S.C. \u00a7 1252 and deny the petition.<footnotemark>1</footnotemark></p>\n<p id=\"b655-20\">We review the BIA\u2019s decision that an applicant is not eligible for asylum, withholding of removal, and CAT relief for \u201csubstantial evidence.\u201d <em>Hu v. Holder, </em>652 F.3d 1011, 1016 (9th Cir.2011). Under this deferential standard, \u201cadministrative findings of fact are conclusive unless any reasonable adjudicator would be compelled to conclude to the contrary.\u201d 8 U.S.C. \u00a7 1252(b)(4)(B).</p>\n<p id=\"b655-21\">I. Asylum and Withholding of Removal</p>\n<p id=\"b655-22\">Saparto argues he was persecuted on account of the protected ground of \u201cimputed political opinion.\u201d \u201cAn imputed political opinion arises when [a] persecutor falsely attributes an opinion to the victim, and then persecutes the victim because of that mistaken belief about the victim\u2019s views.\u201d <em>Baghdasaryan v. Holder, </em>592 F.3d 1018, 1023 n. 6 (9th Cir.2010) (internal quotation marks omitted).</p>\n<p id=\"b655-23\">Substantial evidence supports the BIA\u2019s determination that Saparto did not establish persecution on account of his imputed political opinion. Though he was forcibly conscripted into a militia, the Supreme Court has held that, absent a political motive, an organization\u2019s attempt to conscript a person into its military forces is insufficient to compel a finding of persecution on account of political belief. <em>INS v. Elias-Zacarias, </em>502 U.S. 478, 482, 112 S.Ct. 812, 117 L.Ed.2d 38 (1992). Saparto was not part of a political group at the time of his abduction. He was one of many people abducted and forced to join the militia; he <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"628\">*628</page-number>did not show that he was targeted because of his father\u2019s political opinions. His argument that the militia believed that he was trying to escape because he disagreed with them politically is only based on speculation. Additionally, Saparto presented no evidence that a string of tragic occurrences \u2014 his father\u2019s disappearance, his brother\u2019s arrest, his wife\u2019s death, the militia\u2019s killing of two fellow recruits \u2014 had any connection to his political views. Because Saparto has failed to establish past persecution, he is not eligible for humanitarian asylum. <em>Vongsakdy v. INS, </em>171 F.3d 1203, 1205 (9th Cir.1999).</p>\n<p id=\"b656-4\">Substantial evidence also supports the BIA\u2019s determination that Saparto is ineligible for withholding of removal. The standard for showing eligibility for withholding of removal is more stringent than for asylum. <em>Al-Harbi v. INS, </em>242 F.3d 882, 888-89 (9th Cir.2001). Saparto does not meet the lower asylum standard, let alone the more stringent withholding standard.</p>\n<p id=\"b656-5\">II. Convention Against Torture</p>\n<p id=\"b656-6\">Substantial evidence supports the BIA\u2019s determination that Saparto failed to establish it was more likely than not he would be tortured with the Liberian government\u2019s acquiescence upon removal to Liberia. <em>Nuru v. Gonzales, </em>404 F.3d 1207, 1221 (9th Cir.2005).</p>\n<p id=\"b656-7\">The record indicates improved country conditions in Liberia. A 2006 State Department report noted, among other evidence of changed country conditions, that \u201c[a]fter 14 years of civil war and 2 years of an interim government, Ellen JohnsonSirleaf was declared the winner of multiparty presidential elections on November 23, [2005,] marking a significant milestone in the country\u2019s transition to democracy,\u201d and that there \u201cwere no reports of\u2019 politically motivated disappearances, political detainees, or political prisoners. The report also stated that \u201c[a]s of year\u2019s end, government and [United Nations] security forces effectively controlled all of the country.\u201d As such, the record does not compel the conclusion that the BIA incorrectly denied Saparto relief on this ground.</p>\n<p id=\"b656-9\">PETITION DENIED.</p>\n<footnote label=\"*\">\n<p id=\"b655-17\"> This disposition is not appropriate for publication and is not precedent except as provided by 9th Cir.
