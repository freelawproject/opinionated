We have jurisdiction under 8 U.S.C. \u00a7 1252. We review for substantial evidence the agency\u2019s factual findings, applying the standards governing adverse credibility determinations created by the REAL ID Act. <em>Shrestha v. Holder, </em>590 F.8d 1034, 1039-40 (9th Cir. 2010). We deny the petition for review.</p>\n<p id=\"b663-7\">Substantial evidence supports the BIA\u2019s adverse credibility determination, based on the undisputed testimony from a forensic document analyst that Zhao\u2019s identity card, bail receipt, and notice of dismissal from his job were all counterfeit. <em>Khadka v. Holder, </em>618 F.3d 996, 1001 (9th Cir. 2010) (concluding that, among other things, applicant\u2019s \u201cfailure to disclaim\u201d a fabricated document supported the conclusion that he was aware of the circumstances of its creation). Contrary to Zhao\u2019s argument on appeal, the agency considered the totality of the circumstances in denying his claim. In the absence of credible testimony, Zhao\u2019s asylum and withholding of removal claims fail. <em>See Farah v. Ashcroft, </em>348 F.3d 1153, 1156 (9th Cir.2003).</p>\n<p id=\"b663-8\">Because Zhao\u2019s CAT claim is based on the same testimony the BIA found not credible, and the record does not otherwise compel the conclusion that it is more likely than not that he will be tortured if returned to China, his CAT claim also fails. <em>See id. </em>at 1156-57.</p>\n<p id=\"b663-12\">PETITION FOR REVIEW DENIED.</p>\n<footnote label=\"**\">\n<p id=\"b663-9\"> This disposition is not appropriate for publication and is not precedent except as provided by 9th Cir.
