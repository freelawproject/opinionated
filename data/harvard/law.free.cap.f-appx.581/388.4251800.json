California, </em>386 U.S. 738, 87 S.Ct. 1396, 18 L.Ed.2d 493 (1967), and <em>United States v. Flores, </em>632 F.3d 229 (5th Cir.2011). In response, Flores-King has filed a motion <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"389\">*389</page-number>for appointment of substitute counsel and a Spanish-speaking interpreter.</p>\n<p id=\"b417-5\">Because Flores-King has completed the confinement portion of his sentence and has evinced a desire to appeal only his sentence, his appeal is now moot. <em>See United States v. Rosenbaum-Alanis, </em>483 F.3d 381, 382 (5th Cir.2007); <em>cf United States v. Villanueva-Diaz, </em>634 F.3d 844, 848-849 (5th Cir.2011). Accordingly, the appeal is DISMISSED as moot. Counsel\u2019s motion to withdraw and Flores-King\u2019s motion for appointment of substitute counsel and a Spanish-speaking interpreter are DENIED as unnecessary.</p>\n<footnote label=\"*\">\n<p id=\"b416-5\"> Pursuant to 5th Cir. R. 47.5, the court has determined that this opinion should not be published and is not precedent except under the limited circumstances set forth in 5th Cir. R. 47.5.4.</p>\n</footnote>\n</opinion>\n</casebody>\n",
