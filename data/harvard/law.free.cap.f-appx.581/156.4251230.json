Wilson argues that the District Court did not give appropriate weight to his mental health history and that the resulting sentence was substantively unreasonable. For the reasons that follow, we will affirm the District Court\u2019s judgment of conviction.</p>\n<p id=\"b184-19\">I. BACKGROUND</p>\n<p id=\"b184-20\">Since we write primarily for the benefit of the parties, we recount only the essential facts.</p>\n<p id=\"b184-21\">On September 12, 2013, Wilson pled guilty to an information in the Middle District of Pennsylvania charging him with making a false bomb threat to a federal prison facility, in violation of 18 U.S.C. \u00a7 844(e). Following the guilty plea, Wilson was released on a personal recognizance bond with pretrial services supervision. Supervision occurred in North Carolina. On November 26, 2013, Wilson self-surrendered after a warrant was issued for alleged bail violations. Wilson did not receive a bail revocation hearing and was detained until he appeared before the District Judge for sentencing for his \u00a7 844(e) violation.</p>\n<p id=\"b184-22\">At sentencing, the United States recommended a split-sentence consisting of a period of imprisonment with credit for time served (approximately four months and ten days), followed by commitment to a community confinement facility or halfway house and a period of supervised release. In response to the government\u2019s recommendation, Wilson\u2019s counsel argued that a sentence of time served with supervised release and mental health conditions would be appropriate.</p>\n<p id=\"b184-23\">The District Court adopted the factual findings and Guidelines calculation of the Presentence Investigation Report (\u201cPSR\u201d) in its entirety. Based on a Criminal Histo<page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"157\">*157</page-number>ry Category I and a total offense level 12, Wilson faced an advisory guidelines range of 10-16 months\u2019 imprisonment. The District Court imposed a sentence of 16 months\u2019 imprisonment. Wilson filed a timely appeal of his sentence.</p>\n<p id=\"b185-5\">II. JURISDICTION AND STANDARD OF REVIEW</p>\n<p id=\"b185-6\">The District Court had jurisdiction under 18 U.S.C. \u00a7 3231. We have jurisdiction under 28 U.S.C. \u00a7 1291.</p>\n<p id=\"b185-7\">We review a sentence for substantive reasonableness under an abuse of discretion standard. <em>United States v. Tomko, </em>562 F.3d 558, 567-68 (3d Cir.2009) (en banc).</p>\n<p id=\"b185-8\">III. ANALYSIS</p>\n<p id=\"b185-9\">The only issue on appeal is whether the District Court\u2019s sentence was substantively unreasonable. We conclude that the sentence was not substantively unreasonable.</p>\n<p id=\"b185-10\">An inquiry into the substantive reasonableness of a sentence asks \u201c \u2018whether the final sentence, wherever it may lie within the permissible statutory range, was premised upon appropriate and judicious consideration of the relevant [18 U.S.C. \u00a7 3553(a) ] factors.\u2019 \u201d <em>United States v. Doe, </em>617 F.3d 766, 770 (3d Cir.2010) (quoting <em>United States v. Schweitzer, </em>454 F.3d 197, 204 (3d Cir.2006)). \u201cAbsent procedural error, we will affirm the sentencing court \u2018unless no reasonable sentencing court would have imposed the same sentence on that particular defendant for the reasons the district court provided.\u2019 \u201d <em>Id. </em>(quoting <em>Tomko, </em>562 F.3d at 568). The party challenging the sentence bears the burden of demonstrating unreasonableness. <em>Tomko, </em>562 F.3d at 567.</p>\n<p id=\"b185-14\">Applying this standard, we discern no abuse of discretion in the sentence imposed. The sentencing colloquy evidences that the District Court was thorough in its consideration of the \u00a7 3553(a) factors. The District Court considered the \u201cnature and circumstances of the offense and the history and characteristics of the defendant,\u201d noting specifically that Wilson has \u201can extensive history of mental illness and has exhibited a repeated pattern of disturbing behavior and criminal acts.\u201d App. 92.<footnotemark>1</footnotemark></p>\n<p id=\"b185-15\">Furthermore, we find no merit to Wilson\u2019s argument that the District Court failed to give sufficient weight to Wilson\u2019s mental health history as a mitigating factor under \u00a7 3553(a), and instead treated it as an aggravating factor. To the contrary, the District Court acknowledged Wilson\u2019s \u201cextensive\u201d history of mental illness. <em>Id. </em>There is no basis in the record to infer that the District Court treated Wilson\u2019s mental health as an aggravating factor and calculated the length of Wilson\u2019s sentence to ensure that he receive certain rehabilitative services.<footnotemark>2</footnotemark></p>\n<p id=\"b185-16\">The District Court\u2019s sentence of 16 months\u2019 imprisonment for making a false bomb threat to a federal prison was substantively reasonable. The District Court fully justified its sentence and gave appropriate consideration to the 18 U.S.C. \u00a7 3553(a) factors. The District Court\u2019s <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"158\">*158</page-number>sentence was within the Guidelines range and satisfies all of the elements of a substantively reasonable sentence. Wilson has not met his burden of showing that a reasonable sentencing court would not have imposed the same sentence.</p>\n<p id=\"b186-4\">IV. CONCLUSION</p>\n<p id=\"b186-5\">For the foregoing reasons, we will affirm the judgment of conviction of the District Court.</p>\n<footnote label=\"*\">\n<p id=\"b184-17\"> This disposition is not an opinion of the full Court and pursuant to I.O.P. 5.7 does not constitute binding precedent.</p>\n</footnote>\n<footnote label=\"1\">\n<p id=\"b185-11\">.
