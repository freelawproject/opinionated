The applicable standards of review are well established. <em>See Jian Hui Shao v. Mukasey, </em>546 F.3d 138, 168-69 (2d Cir.2008).</p>\n<p id=\"b112-19\">Petitioners, all natives and citizens of China, filed motions to reopen based on claims that they fear persecution because they have had one or more children in violation of China\u2019s population control program. For largely the same reasons as this Court set forth in <em>Jian Hui Shao, </em>546 F.3d 138, we find no error in the agency\u2019s determinations that the petitioners failed to demonstrate either materially changed country conditions that would excuse the untimely or number-barred filing of their motions or their <em>prima facie </em>eligibility for relief. <em>See id. </em>at 158-72.</p>\n<p id=\"b112-20\">For the foregoing reasons, these petitions for review are DENIED. As we have completed our review, any stay of removal that the Court previously granted in these petitions is VACATED, and any pending motion for a stay of removal in these petitions is DISMISSED as moot. Any pending request for oral argument in these petitions is DENIED in accordance with Federal Rule of Appellate Procedure 34(a)(2), and Second Circuit Local Rule 34.1(b).</p>\n</opinion>\n</casebody>\n",
