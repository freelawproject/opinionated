We have reviewed the record and find no reversible error. Accordingly, we affirm the dismissal of the complaint for the reasons stated by the district court. <em>See Peamon v. Verizon Corp., </em>No. 1:14-cv-00549-GLR (D.Md. Apr. 22, 2014).</p>\n<p id=\"b320-8\">Turning to Peamon\u2019s motion for leave to amend, we note that the district court correctly recognized that it could not grant the post-judgment motion without first vacating the judgment pursuant to Rule 59(e) or Fed.R.Civ.P. 60(b). <em>See Laber v. Harvey, </em>438 F.3d 404, 427 (4th Cir.2006) (en banc). Rather than analyzing Peamon\u2019s motion under the legal standards set forth in Rule 59(e), however, the court should have \u201cevaluate[d] [Peamon\u2019s] post-judgment motion to amend the complaint \u2018under the same legal standard as a similar motion filed before judgment was entered \u2014 for prejudice, bad faith, or futility.\u2019 \u201d <em>Katyle v. Penn Nat\u2019l Gaming, Inc., </em>637 F.3d 462, 471 (4th Cir.2011). Because it is clear that, in seeking to amend his complaint, Peamon merely sought to artificially inflate his damages in order to obtain subject matter jurisdiction, we conclude that Peamon\u2019s motion to amend was filed in bad faith and any resulting error by the district court was harmless. We therefore affirm the district court\u2019s denial of Peamon\u2019s motion for leave to amend.</p>\n<p id=\"b320-10\">We dispense with oral argument because the facts and legal contentions are adequately presented in the materials before this court and argument would not aid the decisional process.</p>\n<p id=\"b320-11\">\n<em>AFFIRMED.</em>\n</p>\n</opinion>\n</casebody>\n",
