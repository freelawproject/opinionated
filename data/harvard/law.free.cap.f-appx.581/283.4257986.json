We affirm.</p>\n<p id=\"b312-7\">We \u201creview de novo whether the district court erred in granting summary judgment, viewing the facts and drawing all reasonable inferences therefrom in the light most favorable to [the non-moving party].\u201d <em>PBM Prods., LLC v. Mead Johnson &amp; Co., </em>639 F.3d 111, 119 (4th Cir.2011). Summary judgment is properly granted \u201cif the movant shows that there is no genuine dispute as to any material fact and the movant is entitled to judgment as a matter of law.\u201d Fed.R.Civ.P. 56(a). We have reviewed the record and the district court\u2019s decision and agree, for the reasons cited by the district court, that there was no genuine dispute as to any material fact. We have reviewed Mostofi\u2019s evidentiary challenges and find them to be without merit.</p>\n<p id=\"b312-8\">Accordingly, we affirm. We dispense with oral argument because the facts and legal contentions are adequately presented in the materials before this court and argument would not aid the decisional process.</p>\n<p id=\"b312-9\">\n<em>AFFIRMED. -</em>\n</p>\n</opinion>\n</casebody>\n",
