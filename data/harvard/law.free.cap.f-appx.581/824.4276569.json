The appellees filed voluntary petitions for bankruptcy under Chapter 7 of the Bankruptcy Code. In their petitions, they reported that their homes were subject to two mortgage liens. In every case, appellant Bank of America, N.A. held the second-priority mortgage liens. In every case, the value of the home was less than the balance of the senior lienholder\u2019s mortgage. Each petitioner sought a determination from the bankruptcy court that Bank of America\u2019s junior mortgage lien was wholly unsecured and, therefore, void under 11 U.S.C. \u00a7 506(a) and (d). The bankruptcy court granted each motion. Bank of America appealed in every case and the district court affirmed every time.</p>\n<p id=\"b1208-25\">Bank of America brought separate appeals to this Court. The appellees filed motions to consolidate the appeals, which this Court granted. Bank of America filed a motion for initial hearing en banc, which this Court denied.</p>\n<p id=\"b1208-26\">When the district court affirms the bankruptcy court\u2019s order, we review only the bankruptcy court\u2019s decision on appeal. <em>Educ. Credit Mgmt. Corp. v. Mosley, </em>494 F.3d 1320, 1324 (11th Cir.2007). We review <em>de novo </em>the bankruptcy court\u2019s legal conclusions. <em>Hemar Ins. Corp. of Am. v. Cox, </em>338 F.3d 1238, 1241 (11th Cir.2003).</p>\n<p id=\"b1208-27\">In <em>Folendore v. United States Small Bus. Admin., </em>862 F.2d 1537 (11th Cir.1989), we held that an allowed claim that is wholly unsecured \u2014 just as Bank of America\u2019s claims are here \u2014 is voidable under the plain language of section 506(d). <em>Id. </em>at 1538-39. Bank of America contends that <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"826\">*826</page-number>the Supreme Court\u2019s decision in <em>Dewsnup v. Timm, </em>502 U.S. 410, 112 S.Ct. 773, 116 L.Ed.2d 903 (1992), abrogated our <em>Folen-dore </em>decision. Bank of America concedes, however, that \u201c[ujnder our prior panel precedent rule, a later panel may depart from an earlier panel\u2019s decision only when the intervening Supreme Court decision is \u2018clearly on point.\u2019 \u201d <em>Atl. Sounding Co., Inc. v. Townsend, </em>496 F.3d 1282, 1284 (11th Cir.2007). Bank of America also concedes that our decision in <em>In re McNeal, </em>735 F.3d 1263 (11th Cir.2012), held that the Supreme Court\u2019s decision in <em>Dewsnwp </em>is not clearly on point because it \u201cdisallowed only a \u2018strip down\u2019 of a partially secured mortgage lien and did not address a \u2018strip off\u201d of a wholly unsecured lien.\u201d <em>Id. </em>at 1265. Our <em>Folendore </em>and <em>McNeal </em>decisions control this case.</p>\n<p id=\"b1209-4\">AFFIRMED.</p>\n</opinion>\n</casebody>\n",
