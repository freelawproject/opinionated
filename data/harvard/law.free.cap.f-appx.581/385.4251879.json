Anderson argues that (1) his claim is cognizable because he alleged the deprivation of property interests without due process, (2) the closure of the hobby shop constituted a seizure under the Fourth Amendment, and (3) the district court should have allowed him to amend his complaint before it was dismissed.</p>\n<p id=\"b413-25\">By moving to proceed IFP, Anderson is challenging the district court\u2019s certification that his appeal is not taken in good faith <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"386\">*386</page-number>under 28 U.S.C. \u00a7 1915(a)(8). <em>See Baugh v. Taylor, </em>117 F.3d 197, 202 (5th Cir.1997). Our inquiry into an appellant\u2019s good faith \u201cis limited to whether the appeal involves legal points arguable on their merits (and therefore not frivolous).\u201d <em>Howard v. King, </em>707 F.2d 215, 220 (5th Cir.1988) (internal quotation marks and citation omitted).</p>\n<p id=\"b414-4\">Anderson has failed to identify a constitutionally protected liberty or property interest. <em>See Sandin v. Conner, </em>515 U.S. 472, 484, 115 S.Ct. 2298, 132 L.Ed.2d 418 (1995); <em>Board of Regents v. Roth, </em>408 U.S. 564, 569-70, 92 S.Ct. 2701, 33 L.Ed.2d 548 (1972). Although he also alleged that the defendants violated his rights under the Fourth Amendment and the Equal Protection Clause, he has failed to show that he had an expectation of privacy or that the defendants acted with discriminatory purposes. <em>See United States v. Ward, </em>561 F.3d 414, 419 (5th Cir.2009); <em>Woods v. Edwards, </em>51 F.3d 577, 580 (5th Cir.1995). Anderson has failed to show that the district court abused its discretion by dismissing his complaint without first permitting him to amend it. <em>See Brewster v. Dretke, </em>587 F.3d 764, 768 (5th Cir.2009). Because Anderson has failed to raise a nonfrivolous issue for appeal, his motion for leave to proceed IFP on appeal is DENIED and his appeal is DISMISSED as frivolous. 5th Cir. R. 42.2.</p>\n<p id=\"b414-5\">The district court\u2019s dismissal of Anderson\u2019s \u00a7 1983 complaint as frivolous and the dismissal of this appeal as frivolous count as strikes under \u00a7 1915(g). <em>See </em>\u00a7 1915(g); <em>Adepegba v. Hammons, </em>103 F.3d 383, 387-88 (5th Cir.1996). Anderson is WARNED that if he accumulates three strikes, he will not be allowed to proceed IFP in any civil action or appeal filed while he is incarcerated or detained in any facility unless he is under imminent danger of serious physical injury. <em>See </em>\u00a7 1915(g).</p>\n<footnote label=\"*\">\n<p id=\"b413-9\"> Pursuant to 5th Cir. R. 47.5, the court has determined that this opinion should not be published and is not precedent except under the limited circumstances set forth in 5th Cir. R. 47.5.4.</p>\n</footnote>\n</opinion>\n</casebody>\n",
