Titus\u2019 counsel has filed a brief pursuant to <em>Anders v. California, </em>386 U.S. 738, 87 S.Ct. 1396, 18 L.Ed.2d 493 (1967), stating that he has found no meritorious grounds for appeal but questioning whether the sentence imposed is substantively reasonable. Titus has filed a pro se supplemental brief challenging the district court\u2019s calculation of his offense level and criminal history category under the Sentencing Guidelines. We affirm.</p>\n<p id=\"b334-7\">We review a sentence for reasonableness, applying \u201ca deferential abuse-of-discretion standard.\u201d <em>Gall v. United States, 552 </em>U.S. 38, 41, 128 S.Ct. 586, 169 L.Ed.2d 445 (2007). This review entails appellate consideration of both the procedural and substantive reasonableness of the sentence. <em>Id. </em>at 51, 128 S.Ct. 586. In determining procedural reasonableness, we consider, among other things, whether the district court properly calculated the advisory Guidelines range. <em>Id.</em></p>\n<p id=\"b334-8\">Titus first questions whether the district court erred by assessing one criminal history point for a prior conviction that he claims did not occur. Because Titus did not object to the calculation of his criminal history below, this claim is reviewed for plain error. <em>See Henderson v. United States, </em>\u2014 U.S. -, 133 S.Ct. 1121, 1126-27, 185 L.Ed.2d 85 (2013) (discussing standard of review); <em>United States v. Lynn, </em>592 F.3d 572, 577 (4th Cir.2010) (same). Based on this record, we conclude that Titus has failed to show that the district court\u2019s consideration of the challenged conviction was plain error. <em>See United States v. Slade, </em>631 F.3d 185, 188 (4th Cir.2011) (\u201cThe defendant bears the burden of establishing that the information relied upon by the district court \u2014 here the [presentence report] \u2014 is erroneous.\u201d).</p>\n<p id=\"b334-12\">Nor do we find error \u2014 plain or otherwise \u2014 in the district court\u2019s imposition of a four-level enhancement for possession of a firearm in connection with another felony offense under <em>U.S. Sentencing Guidelines Manual </em>\u00a7 2K2.1 (b)(6)(B) (2012). The district court found that Titus\u2019 possession of 3.48 grams of crack cocaine divided and wrapped in five individual packages constituted a drug trafficking offense. Because officers found the firearm in Titus\u2019 backpack \u201cin close proximity\u201d to the cocaine base found on his person at the time of his arrest, the district court did not err in imposing this enhancement. <em>See id. </em>&amp; cmt. n. 14(B)(n).</p>\n<p id=\"b334-13\">Counsel questions whether the sentence imposed was substantively reasonable. A within-Guidelines sentence, like the one the district court imposed on Titus, is presumed reasonable on appeal, <em>United States v. Susi, </em>674 F.3d 278, 289 (4th Cir.2012), and the defendant bears the burden to \u201crebut the presumption by demonstrating that the sentence is unreasonable when measured against the [18 U.S.C.] \u00a7 3553(a) [ (2012) ] factors.\u201d <em>United States v. Montes-Pineda, </em>445 F.3d 375, 379 (4th Cir.2006) (internal quotation marks omitted). Having reviewed the record and the explanation given by the district court, we conclude that Titus has not shown that his sentence is substantively unreasonable.</p>\n<p id=\"b334-14\">In accordance with <em>Anders, </em>we have reviewed the entire record for any meritorious grounds for appeal and have found none. Accordingly, we affirm the district court\u2019s judgment. This court requires that <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"307\">*307</page-number>counsel inform Titus, in writing, of his right to petition the Supreme Court of the United States for further review. If Titus requests that a petition be filed, but counsel believes that such a petition would be frivolous, counsel may move in this court for leave to withdraw from representation. Counsel\u2019s motion must state that a copy thereof was served on Titus. We dispense with oral argument because the facts and legal contentions are adequately presented in the materials before this court and argument would not aid the decisional process.</p>\n<p id=\"b335-5\">\n<em>AFFIRMED.</em>\n</p>\n</opinion>\n</casebody>\n",
