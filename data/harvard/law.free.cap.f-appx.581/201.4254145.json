The district court sentenced Bailey to a total of 264 months\u2019 imprisonment, below the bottom of his advisory Guidelines range.</p>\n<p id=\"b230-4\">Counsel for Bailey has filed this appeal pursuant to <em>Anders v. California, </em>386 U.S. 738, 87 S.Ct. 1396, 18 L.Ed.2d 493 (1967), certifying that there are no meritorious grounds for appeal but arguing that his sentence is procedurally unreasonable. Specifically, counsel questions the district court\u2019s calculation of the base offense level, specific offense characteristics, and Bailey\u2019s role in the offense. Bailey was advised of his right to file a pro se supplemental brief but has not done so. The Government has not submitted a response brief. For the reasons that follow, we affirm.</p>\n<p id=\"b230-5\">We review a criminal sentence, \u201cwhether inside, just outside, or significantly outside the Guidelines range,\u201d for reasonableness \u201cunder a deferential abuse-of-discretion standard.\u201d <em>United States v. King, </em>673 F.3d 274, 283 (4th Cir.2012); <em>see Gall v. United States, </em>552 U.S. 38, 46, 51, 128 S.Ct. 586, 169 L.Ed.2d 445 (2007). When determining a sentence, the district court must first calculate the defendant\u2019s advisory Guidelines range. <em>Gall, </em>552 U.S. at 49-50, 128 S.Ct. 586. \u201cIn assessing the district court\u2019s calculation of the Guidelines range, we review its legal conclusions de novo and its factual findings for clear error.\u201d <em>United States v. Cox, </em>744 F.3d 305, 308 (4th Cir.2014).</p>\n<p id=\"b230-6\">Bailey did not object to any aspect of the sentencing calculus, so our review is limited to plain error. <em>See United States v. Hamilton, </em>701 F.3d 404, 410 (4th Cir. 2012), <em>cert. denied, </em>\u2014 U.S. -, 133 S.Ct. 1838, 185 L.Ed.2d 846 (2013). \u201cTo establish plain error, the appealing party must show that an error (1) was made, (2) is plain (i.e., clear or obvious), and (3) affects substantial rights.\u201d <em>United States v. Lynn, </em>592 F.3d 572, 577 (4th Cir.2010).</p>\n<p id=\"b230-9\">The record contains sufficient evidence to support Bailey\u2019s base offense level, as well as the increases for possession of a firearm and maintenance of a drug premises, as well as his leadership role in the offense. Therefore, the district court\u2019s Guidelines calculation contains no error, and certainly no plain error. Consequently, Bailey\u2019s claims are meritless.</p>\n<p id=\"b230-10\">In accordance with <em>Anders, </em>we have reviewed the record and have found no meritorious issues for appeal. We therefore affirm Bailey\u2019s convictions and sentence. This court requires that counsel inform Bailey, in writing, of his right to petition the Supreme Court of the United States for further review. If Bailey requests that a petition be filed, but counsel believes that such a petition would be frivolous, counsel may move in this court for leave to withdraw from representation. Counsel\u2019s motion must state that a copy thereof was served on Bailey. We dispense with oral argument because the facts and legal contentions are adequately presented in the materials before this court and argument would not aid the decisional process.</p>\n<p id=\"b230-11\">\n<em>AFFIRMED.</em>\n</p>\n</opinion>\n</casebody>\n",
