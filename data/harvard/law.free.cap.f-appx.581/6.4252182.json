WINTER, PIERRE N. LEVAL and DENNY CHIN, Circuit Judges.</p>\n<opinion data-order=\"7\" data-type=\"opinion\" id=\"x999-1\" type=\"majority\">\n<p id=\"b35-5\">\n<em>SUMMARY ORDER</em>\n</p>\n<p id=\"b35-6\">Plaintiff-appellant Ling Li, proceeding <em>pro se, </em>appeals from the district court\u2019s order and judgment dismissing her complaint and barring her from filing any further actions in the district court without first obtaining leave of court. We assume the parties\u2019 familiarity with the underlying facts, procedural history of the case, and issues on appeal.</p>\n<p id=\"b35-7\">1. <em>Dismissal</em></p>\n<p id=\"b35-8\">We review <em>de novo </em>a district court\u2019s <em>sua sponte </em>dismissal of a complaint pursuant to 28 U.S.C. \u00a7 1915(e). <em>See Giano v. Goord, </em>250 F.3d 146, 149-50 (2d Cir.2001). The complaint must plead \u201cenough facts to state a claim to relief that is plausible on its face.\u201d <em>Bell Atl. Corp. v. Twombly, </em>550 U.S. 544, 570, 127 S.Ct. 1955, 167 L.Ed.2d 929 (2007). A claim will have \u201cfacial plausibility when the plaintiff pleads factual content that allows the court to draw the reasonable inference that the defendant is liable for the misconduct alleged.\u201d <em>Ashcroft v. Iqbal, </em>556 U.S. 662, 678, 129 S.Ct. 1937, 173 L.Ed.2d 868 (2009). <em>Pro se </em>complaints should be liberally construed, and district courts generally should not dismiss a <em>pro se </em>complaint without granting the plaintiff leave to amend, unless it would be futile. <em>See Cuoco v. Moritsugu, </em>222 F.3d 99, 112 (2d Cir.2000).</p>\n<p id=\"b35-9\">\u201cThe preclusive effect of a judgment is defined by claim preclusion and issue preclusion, which are collectively referred to as \u2018res judicata.\u2019 \u201d <em>Taylor v. Sturgell, </em>553 U.S. 880, 892, 128 S.Ct. 2161, 171 L.Ed.2d 155 (2008). The doctrine of claim preclusion \u201cforecloses successive litigation of the very same claim, whether or not relitigation of the claim raises the same issues as the earlier suit.\u201d <em>Id. </em>(internal quotation marks omitted). The related doctrine of issue preclusion bars \u201csuccessive litigation of an issue of fact or law actually litigated and resolved in a valid court determination essential to the prior judgment.\u201d <em>Id.</em></p>\n<p id=\"b35-11\">Although Li\u2019s allegations of discriminatory treatment between 2009 and 2012 are precluded by res judicata, the doctrine does not bar her claims of discriminatory conduct after the filing of her last complaint. Claims that arise after an action has been filed \u2014 and therefore could not have been brought in that action \u2014 \u201care not barred by res judicata regardless of whether they are premised on facts representing a continuance of the same course of conduct.\u201d <em>Storey v. Cello Holdings, L.L.C., </em>347 F.3d 370, 383 (2d Cir.2003) (internal quotation marks and italics omitted). \u2018\u201cWhile the [prior] judgment precludes recovery on claims arising prior to its entry, it cannot be given the effect of extinguishing claims which did not even then exist and which could not possibly have been sued upon in the previous case.\u2019 \u201d <em>Id. </em>(alteration in original) (quoting <em>Lawlor v. Nat\u2019l Screen Serv. Corp., </em>349 U.S. 322, 328, 75 S.Ct. 865, 99 L.Ed. 1122 (1955)). Thus, Li\u2019s claim arising from her failure to be rehired in 2013 is not barred by res judicata.</p>\n<p id=\"b35-13\">Nevertheless, we affirm because Li failed to state a claim on which relief may be granted. <em>See Adeleke v. United States, </em>355 F.3d 144, 147 (2d Cir.2004) (noting appellate court\u2019s ability to \u201caffirm a judgment on any ground that finds support in the record\u201d). Li\u2019s allegation of discrimination is based solely on the fact that defendant-appellee The Asphalt Green, Inc. (\u201cAsphalt Green\u201d) failed to rehire her in 2013 for the same or similar position that she once had. She failed to allege any facts from which it could be plausibly in<page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"8\">*8</page-number>ferred that Asphalt Green had a discriminatory motive. Moreover, Li has not alleged any additional facts on appeal that suggest she could amend her complaint to remedy this problem.</p>\n<p id=\"b36-4\">The district court properly determined that Li\u2019s claims against defendant-appellee Jeff Dorn were frivolous because her claims of mental sorcery were implausible.</p>\n<p id=\"b36-5\">2. <em>Filing Bar</em></p>\n<p id=\"b36-6\">We review for abuse of discretion a district court\u2019s imposition, as a sanction, of an injunction under the All Writs Act, 28 U.S.C. \u00a7 1651, barring plaintiffs from filing further claims without leave of court. <em>See United States v. Int\u2019l Bhd. of Teamsters, </em>266 F.3d 45, 49 (2d Cir.2001) (grant of injunction under the All Writs Act reviewed for abuse of discretion); <em>Gollomp v. Spitzer, </em>568 F.3d 355, 368 (2d Cir.2009) (decision to impose sanctions reviewed for abuse of discretion). A district court \u201cmay not impose a filing injunction on a litigant ... without providing the litigant with notice and an opportunity to be heard.\u201d <em>Iwachiw v. N.Y. State Dep\u2019t of Motor Vehicles, </em>396 F.3d 525, 529 (2d Cir.2005).</p>\n<p id=\"b36-7\">Here, the district court did not abuse its discretion in enjoining Li from filing any further lawsuits without first obtaining leave of court because this was Li\u2019s third lawsuit arising from her former employment at Asphalt Green. Moreover, the district court gave Li notice and an opportunity to be heard prior to imposing the filing injunction, and Li submitted a response. The court considered Li\u2019s arguments and reasonably determined them to be insufficient.</p>\n<p id=\"b36-9\">We have considered Li\u2019s remaining arguments and find them to be without merit. Accordingly, we AFFIRM the judgment of the district court.</p>\n</opinion>\n</casebody>\n",
