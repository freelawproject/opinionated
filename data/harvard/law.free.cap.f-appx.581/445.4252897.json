We reverse.</p>\n<p id=\"b474-8\">I.</p>\n<p id=\"b474-9\">Lyons is a former employee of the Texas Department of Criminal Justice (\u201cTDCJ\u201d). In 2001, Lyons began working at TDCJ as a public information officer (\u201cPIO\u201d). At this time, Lyons\u2019 immediate supervisor at the Public Information Office was Larry Fitzgerald. Fitzgerald retired in 2003. In 2006, Lyons was herself appointed as TDCJ\u2019s Director of the Public Information Office (\u201cPI Director\u201d). Her responsibilities included supervising PIO Jason Clark and an office secretary, Rebecca Blanton.</p>\n<p id=\"b474-10\">In 2011, Blanton informed TDCJ\u2019s deputy executive director, Bryan Collier, of irregularities in Lyons\u2019 timekeeping. Collier then assigned Thomas Prasifka to investigate Blanton\u2019s allegations. The focus of Prasifka\u2019s investigation was whether Lyons had reported working full 8-hour days when she had not actually been in the office or at an approved off-site location as required by TDCJ regulations. Prasifka found evidence that Lyons had committed multiple timekeeping violations and reported his findings to Collier.</p>\n<p id=\"b474-15\">Collier concluded that Lyons\u2019 violations were serious enough to justify termination under TDCJ policy. Rather than terminating Lyons\u2019 employment, however, Collier consolidated Lyons\u2019 multiple timekeeping violations into a single violation and demoted Lyons from PI Director to PIO. At this time, Lyons reported to Collier that Clark had used the same timekeeping practices that she had. Based on Lyons\u2019 allegations, Prasifka then investigated Clark\u2019s timesheets as well. Prasifka\u2019s second investigation apparently did not yield sufficient evidence, however, to justify Clark\u2019s termination or demotion.</p>\n<p id=\"b474-16\">Lyons filed this action in district court in 2012. Lyons advanced gender discrimination claims under Title VII of the Civil Rights Act of 1964, as codified at 42 U.S.C. \u00a7 2000e-2(a)(l). Specifically, Lyons claimed that Clark, a male employee, committed the same timekeeping violations as Lyons but was not subjected to any adverse employment action. Thus, Lyons submits that she was treated less favorably than a similarly situated male employee resulting in a violation of Lyons\u2019 rights under Title VII.</p>\n<p id=\"b474-17\">TDCJ moved for summary judgment, arguing that Lyons\u2019 demotion had a legitimate, non-discriminatory justification\u2014 Lyons\u2019 failure to consistently maintain accurate timesheets. The district court granted summary judgment in favor of TDCJ. Lyons appeals.</p>\n<p id=\"b474-18\">II.</p>\n<p id=\"b474-19\">We review a district court\u2019s grant of summary judgment under Rule 56(a) de novo, applying the same standards as the <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"447\">*447</page-number>district court.<footnotemark>1</footnotemark> The court must view the evidence in the light most favorable to the non-movant and may not weigh evidence or make credibility determinations.<footnotemark>2</footnotemark> When analyzing a discrimination claim based on circumstantial evidence, we apply the <em>McDonnell Douglas </em>burden-shifting framework.<footnotemark>3</footnotemark></p>\n<p id=\"b475-5\">III.</p>\n<p id=\"b475-6\">The affidavit of Lyons\u2019 former supervisor, Larry Fitzgerald, supports a jury finding that PIOs were not required to follow TDCJ\u2019s written timekeeping policy. Fitzgerald stated:</p>\n<blockquote id=\"b475-7\">As Ms. Lyons\u2019 supervisor, I instructed her on how to keep her time. I explained to Ms. Lyons that since she was an exempt employee she was not eligible for overtime. Therefore, it was not necessary for her to track her hours to the minute on a day-to-day basis.</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b475-8\">I also explained to her since she was an exempt employee it was not necessary for her to work a set shift. Instead, if she had an errand she needed to run, or needed to leave the office prior to 5:00 p.m. when the PIO office closed, that she could do so without any adverse action. Simply put, this is because the PIO officers, including me and Ms. Lyons, worked many hours each week outside of work at our homes and during what would otherwise be \u201cpersonal time\u201d since we received media inquires [sic ] day and night, seven days a week. Therefore, I informed Ms. Lyons that the TDCJ requires that she work a minimum of 40 hours per week, and that as long as she was working at least that much, that it did not matter whether she was in the office from to 8:00 to 5:00 daily. Rather, I explained since she was responsible for insuring that she timely and appropriately answered all media inquiries, that as long as she worked 40 hours per week, she could fill out her timesheets by marking 8 hours in the office per day.</blockquote>\n<p id=\"b475-14\">Fitzgerald\u2019s affidavit was not mentioned by either the district court or TDCJ in its brief to this court.</p>\n<p id=\"b475-15\">A reasonable jury could conclude from Fitzgerald\u2019s explanation, together with the summary judgment evidence that Lyons\u2019 co-worker, Clark, also did not strictly follow TDCJ\u2019s timesheet policy as written, that TDCJ\u2019s timesheet policy recognized a de facto exception for PIOs. If the de facto exception was selectively ignored in Lyons\u2019 case, a reasonable jury could also conclude that Lyons\u2019 violation of TDCJ\u2019s timesheet policy was a pretext for her demotion. An employer\u2019s selective application of a facially neutral policy is evidence of pretext, as many courts have concluded.<footnotemark>4</footnotemark> As we also suggested in <em>E.E.O.C. v. Louisiana Office of Community Services, </em>47 F.3d 1438, 1445-46 (5th Cir.1995), an inference of pretext may be drawn based on evidence that an employ<page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"448\">*448</page-number>er\u2019s relevant rules and standards \u201cwere not consistently applied.\u201d<footnotemark>5</footnotemark></p>\n<p id=\"b476-4\">Accordingly, because triable issues of fact remain as to whether Lyons\u2019 violation of the timesheet policy was the actual reason for her demotion or a pretext, TDCJ was not entitled to summary judgment. We therefore vacate the district court\u2019s order and remand for further proceedings consistent with this opinion.</p>\n<p id=\"b476-5\">REVERSED and REMANDED.</p>\n<footnote label=\"*\">\n<p id=\"b474-11\"> Pursuant to 5th Cir.
