Black\u2019s sole argument on appeal is that the district court imposed a substantively unreasonable sentence on his firearm conviction because the district court \u201cnearly doubl[ed]\u201d his Guidelines range for that conviction. We affirm the district court\u2019s judgment.</p>\n<p id=\"b292-8\">Upon review of the parties\u2019 briefs and the record, we conclude that the 108-month sentence on the firearm conviction, which represents a forty-eight-month upward variance from the advisory Guidelines range for that conviction, is not substantively unreasonable. When a district court has imposed a variant sentence, we consider the reasonableness of imposing a variance and the extent of the variance. <em>United States v. Tucker, </em>473 F.3d 556, 561 (4th Cir.2007). A greater variance requires more substantial justification. <em>United States v. Diosdado-Star, </em>630 F.3d 359, 366 (4th Cir.2011). \u201cGenerally, if the reasons justifying the variance are tied to [18 U.S.C.] \u00a7 3553(a) [ (2012) ] and are plausible, the sentence will be deemed reasonable.\u201d <em>Tucker, </em>473 F.3d at 561 (internal quotation marks and citation omitted). We conclude that the district court adequately explained Black\u2019s sentence and appropriately tied its rationale for the variant sentence to the \u00a7 3553(a) factors it deemed relevant. Thus, we find that the 108-month sentence imposed on Black\u2019s firearm conviction is reasonable.</p>\n<p id=\"b292-10\">We therefore affirm the district court\u2019s judgment. We dispense with oral argument because the facts and legal contentions are adequately presented in the materials before this court and argument would not aid the decisional process.</p>\n<p id=\"b292-11\">\n<em>AFFIRMED.</em>\n</p>\n</opinion>\n</casebody>\n",
