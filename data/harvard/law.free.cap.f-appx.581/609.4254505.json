Her counsel has filed a brief under <em>Anders v. California, </em>386 U.S. 738, 87 S.Ct. 1396, 18 L.Ed.2d 493 (1967), acknowledging an appeal waiver in Harris\u2019s plea agreement and asserting arguments. Counsel has also moved for leave to withdraw. Harris has filed a pro se supplemental brief challenging her sentence.</p>\n<p id=\"b637-27\">After careful de novo review, we enforce the appeal waiver.\u2019 <em>See United States v. Andis, </em>333 F.3d 886, 889-92 (8th Cir.2003) (en banc) (court should enforce appeal waiver and dismiss appeal where it falls within scope of waiver, plea agreement and waiver were entered into knowingly and voluntarily, and no miscarriage of justice would result); <em>see also United States v. Scott, </em>627 F.3d 702, 704 (8th Cir.2010) (standard of review). We note that Harris\u2019s statements under oath at the plea hearing showed that she entered into both the plea agreement and the appeal waiver knowingly and voluntarily. <em>See Nguyen v. United States, </em>114 F.3d 699, 703 (8th Cir. 1997) (defendant\u2019s statements made during plea hearing carry strong presumption of verity).</p>\n<p id=\"b637-28\">Having independently reviewed the record pursuant to <em>Penson v. Ohio, </em>488 U.S. <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"610\">*610</page-number>75, 109 S.Ct. 346, 102 L.Ed.2d 300 (1988), we find no nonfrivolous issues outside the scope of the appeal waiver. This appeal is dismissed, and counsel\u2019s motion to withdraw is granted.</p>\n<footnote label=\"1\">\n<p id=\"b637-29\">.
