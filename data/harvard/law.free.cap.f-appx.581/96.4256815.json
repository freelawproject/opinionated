Garcia was convicted on both counts. At the urging of the government, the jury was not asked to make any finding as to whether the firearm \u201cused and carried\u201d was, in fact, discharged. Instead, the court itself made the finding as to discharge and, pursuant to that finding, the district court imposed what it believed to be the mandatory minimum prison term of 120 months for each count, to be served consecutively.</p>\n<p id=\"b125-17\">Among the several challenges that Garcia brings on appeal, he argues that the Supreme Court\u2019s decision in <em>Alleyne v. United States, </em>\u2014 U.S. -, 133 S.Ct. 2151, 186 L.Ed.2d 314 (2013), requires that this Court remand for resentencing. The government concedes this argument, and we agree. Accordingly, we instruct the district court to vacate and resentence, with a mandatory minimum sentence on Count Two of five years\u2019 imprisonment, <em>see </em>18 U.S.C. \u00a7 924(c)(l)(A)(i), in keeping with the jury\u2019s factual findings that Garcia used and carried a firearm in furtherance of the conspiracy.</p>\n<p id=\"b125-20\">We decline to address Garcia\u2019s \u2022 argument that he was deprived of effective assistance of counsel at sentencing. The opportunity for resentencing renders that argument moot.</p>\n<p id=\"b125-21\">We have considered Garcia\u2019s remaining arguments and find them to be without merit. For the reasons stated above, the judgment of the district court is AFFIRMED in part and REMANDED in part.</p>\n</opinion>\n</casebody>\n",
