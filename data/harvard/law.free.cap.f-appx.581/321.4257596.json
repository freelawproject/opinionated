We affirm the district court\u2019s judgment.</p>\n<p id=\"b351-7\">I.</p>\n<p id=\"b351-8\">Plaintiff, Dr. Anthony Ioppolo (\u201cIoppolo\u201d), a neurosurgeon in Baton Rouge, Louisiana, testified as an expert for the plaintiff in a Florida medical malpractice case in 2003. Drs. Mark Cuffe (\u201cCuffe\u201d) and Christopher Rumana (\u201cRumana\u201d) operated a neurological clinic in partnership with Dr. Eric Vogter, the principal defendant in the Florida case.<footnotemark>1</footnotemark> Following a settlement between the parties in the Florida proceedings, Drs. Rumana and Cuffe filed a complaint against Dr. Ioppolo with the American Association of Neurosurgeons (the \u201cAANS\u201d), alleging unprofessional conduct as it related to his expert testimony. Ioppolo, Rumana, and Cuffe are all members of the American Association of Neurological Surgeons (\u201cAANS\u201d), a private, voluntary association of neurosurgeons. The AANS encourages its members to testify as expert witnesses, as long as the testimony is in accordance with its Expert Witness Guidelines.</p>\n<p id=\"b351-9\">The Guidelines provide that the testimony be \u201ctruly expert, impartial and available to all litigants.\u201d Pursuant to the AANS bylaws, any active member in good standing \u201cmay prefer charges alleging that a Member is failing to maintain a good professional standing.\u201d Such a charge must be made in writing and state the basis of the charge. The written charge must be delivered to the Secretary of the Board of Directors, who is then required to forward a copy to the Professional Conduct Committee (\u201cPCC\u201d). Thereafter, the PCC \u201cshall call on the members who bring the charges ... to determine whether a hearing on the charges is warranted, and shall give the respondent an opportunity to respond in writing before such a decision is made.\u201d No action can be taken by the PCC against a member without giving that member an opportunity for a hearing. If the PCC determines that a hearing is necessary, the respondent member is entitled to conduct a self-defense or be represented by counsel. After the hearing, the PCC prepares its findings and recommendations in a written report submitted to the Board of Directors. Before the Board takes action on the PCC\u2019s report, the respondent member has an opportunity to comment on the report. If the outcome before the Board is unfavorable to the respondent member, he has an opportunity to appeal the Board\u2019s decision.</p>\n<p id=\"b351-13\">After the medical malpractice trial, Rumana and Cuffe preferred such a charge against Ioppolo by letter to the AANS criticizing his \u201cethics, honesty, integrity, and professionalism.\u201d The letter accused Ioppolo of giving \u201cfalse and misleading testimony\u201d during the trial in Florida. Upon receiving the letter, the AANS convened the PCC to investigate the allega<page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"324\">*324</page-number>tions made by Rumana and Cuffe. A hearing was conducted in October 2004 where Ioppolo, Rumana, and Cuffe were all present. In December 2004, the PCC found that Ioppolo\u2019s conduct was \u201cunprofessional\u201d and \u201cegregious,\u201d and recommended imposing sanctions against Ioppolo, subject to review by the Board of Directors of AANS at its annual meeting in April 2005. On April 15, 2005, the Board, after reviewing the PCC report and the CAT scan films of the patient in the Florida malpractice litigation, unanimously approved the two-year suspension recommended by the PCC.</p>\n<p id=\"b352-4\">On March 7, 2005, before the Board decision but after the PCC report was furnished to the parties, Rumana and Cuffe wrote to the Louisiana Board of Medical Examiners, seeking to file a formal charge of unprofessional conduct with that organization against Ioppolo. In addition, on April 15, 2005 (the day of the Board\u2019s decision), Rumana and Cuffe distributed a copy of the PCC\u2019s preliminary findings to Louisiana Worker\u2019s Compensation Corporation (\u201cLWCC\u201d) where Ioppolo served as medical director. Ioppolo also alleges that Rumana and Cuffe sent copies to Vista Surgical Hospital (where Ioppolo served as medical director), and the Neuromedical Center in Baton Rouge, Louisiana (Ioppolo\u2019s former workplace).</p>\n<p id=\"b352-5\">In February 2006, Ioppolo sued the AANS, Rumana, Cuffe, and the American College of Surgeons in state court. Ioppolo asserted claims of defamation, abuse of process, abuse of personal rights, and intentional infliction of emotional distress (\u201cIIED\u201d). Defendants removed the case on the basis of diversity jurisdiction under 28 U.S.C \u00a7 1382.</p>\n<p id=\"b352-7\">In March 2006, the AANS, Rumana, and Cuffe filed motions to dismiss for failure to state a claim pursuant to Rule 12(b)(6) of the Federal Rules of Civil Procedure. In April 2006, Ioppolo was granted a temporary restraining order to prevent the AANS from publishing the fact that it had suspended Ioppolo\u2019s membership in the organization while his case was pending in the district court. In July 2006, all parties agreed to a preliminary injunction.</p>\n<p id=\"b352-8\">Two years later, in July 2008, the district court heard arguments on the pending motions to dismiss, at which time it denied the motions filed by Rumana and Cuffe, and deferred ruling on the motion by the AANS. The court also instructed Ioppolo to amend his complaint against the AANS, or his claims against the AANS would be dismissed. In August 2008, Ioppolo filed a Second Amended Complaint against the AANS, alleging the same four causes of action. The AANS responded with a motion to dismiss the complaint.</p>\n<p id=\"b352-9\">In August 2011, the district court granted the AANS\u2019s motion to dismiss, finding that Ioppolo had failed to state a claim for defamation, abuse of process, abuse of rights, or IIED. This left for resolution the claims against Drs. Rumana and Cuffe.</p>\n<p id=\"b352-10\">In July 2012, Rumana and Cuffe each filed a \u201crenewed\u201d motion to dismiss Ioppolo\u2019s claims against them pursuant to Rule 12(b)(6). The district court granted the motions with respect to Ioppolo\u2019s claims for abuse of rights, abuse of process, and IIED. The court also dismissed Ioppolo\u2019s defamation claim with respect to the initial publication of the PCC report because the claim was time barred under Louisiana\u2019s one-year prescriptive period.<footnotemark>2</footnotemark> The court declined to dismiss Ioppolo\u2019s defamation claim with respect to the subsequent publi<page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"325\">*325</page-number>cations by Rumana and Cuffe because they fell within the one-year prescriptive period.</p>\n<p id=\"b353-5\">Following the district court\u2019s ruling on the motions to dismiss, the only surviving claims were Ioppolo\u2019s claims for defamation with respect to Rumana and Cuffe\u2019s later publication of the PCC Report in March and April 2005. In January 2013, Cuffe filed a motion for summary judgment as to this claim. Rumana filed his own motion in March 2013. The district court granted both motions.</p>\n<p id=\"b353-6\">Ioppolo appeals from the district court\u2019s dismissal of each of his four claims.</p>\n<p id=\"b353-7\">II.</p>\n<p id=\"b353-8\">We review a district court\u2019s dismissal under Rule 12(b)(6) of the Federal Rules of Civil Procedure <em>de novo</em><footnotemark><em>3</em></footnotemark><em> </em>construing all factual allegations in the light most favorable to the plaintiffs.<footnotemark>4</footnotemark> We accept as true all the facts pleaded in the complaint.<footnotemark>5</footnotemark> For a complaint to state a claim, the non-moving party must plead enough facts to state a claim to relief that is plausible on its face.<footnotemark>6</footnotemark></p>\n<p id=\"b353-9\">\u201cThis court reviews a district court\u2019s grant of summary judgment <em>de novo, </em>applying the same standards as the district court.\u201d<footnotemark>7</footnotemark> \u201cSummary judgment is warranted if the pleadings, the discovery and disclosure materials on file, and any affidavits show there is no genuine [dispute] as to any material fact and that the movant is entitled to judgment as a matter of law.\u201d<footnotemark>8</footnotemark> \u2018Without weighing the evidence, assessing its probative value, or resolving any factual disputes ... we merely search the record for resolution-determinative factual disputes.\u201d<footnotemark>9</footnotemark> We must draw all reasonable inferences in favor of the nonmoving party and may not make credibility determinations.<footnotemark>10</footnotemark></p>\n<p id=\"b353-18\">III.</p>\n<p id=\"b353-19\">A.</p>\n<p id=\"b353-20\">We turn first to Ioppolo\u2019s claims for abuse of process and abuse of right. \u201cAbuse of process involves the misuse of a process already legally issued whereby a party attempts to obtain a result not proper under the law.\u201d<footnotemark>11</footnotemark> To prevail on an abuse of process claim in Louisiana, a plaintiff must prove each of two elements: (1) the existence of an ulterior purpose; (2) a willful act in the use of the process not proper in the regular prosecution of the proceeding.<footnotemark>12</footnotemark></p>\n<p id=\"b354-3\"><page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"326\">*326</page-number>The district court concluded that the AANS proceedings did not constitute a \u201cprocess\u201d in this context under Louisiana law. We agree. Louisiana courts have never considered the \u201cprocess\u201d element of a cause of action for abuse of process \u201canything other than legal process, or court process.\u201d<footnotemark>13</footnotemark> Rather, under Louisiana law:</p>\n<blockquote id=\"b354-4\">[A]buse of process is the misuse of <em>legal process </em>for an ulterior purpose. It consists in the malicious misuse or misapplication of that process after issuance to accomplish some purpose not warranted or commanded by the writ. It is malicious perversion of a <em>legally issued process </em>whereby a result not lawfully or properly obtainable under it is attempted to be secured.<footnotemark>14</footnotemark></blockquote>\n<p id=\"b354-5\">There is no evidence to suggest that the AANS proceedings are anything other than the mechanism of a private professional organization to enforce its ethical and professional standards. Therefore, Ioppolo has failed to state a claim for abuse of process under Louisiana law because he has not alleged the use of any qualifying \u201cprocess.\u201d</p>\n<p id=\"b354-13\">The abuse of rights doctrine is a civil law concept which is rarely used in Louisiana,<footnotemark>15</footnotemark> and applies only when one of the following conditions are met: (1) the predominant motive for exercise of the right is to cause harm; (2) there is no serious or legitimate motive for exercise of the right; (8) the exercise of the right violates moral rules, good faith, or elementary fairness; or (4) the exercise of the right is for a purpose other than that for which it was granted.<footnotemark>16</footnotemark> The district court dismissed Ioppolo\u2019s abuse of rights claim for failure to state a claim. The court determined Ioppolo failed to allege facts which would support a cause of action for any of the four conditions above.</p>\n<p id=\"b354-14\">Ioppolo contends that the AANS, Rumana, and Cuffe abused their rights under the AANS bylaws by pursuing the complaint against him as a result of his expert testimony. However, he fails to adequately brief this argument on appeal.<footnotemark>17</footnotemark> For <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"327\">*327</page-number>this reason, Ioppolo has waived any argument with respect to his claim for abuse of rights, and we affirm the district court\u2019s dismissal for the reasons stated by the district court.</p>\n<p id=\"b355-5\">B.</p>\n<p id=\"b355-6\">Next, we address Ioppolo\u2019s claim for Intentional Infliction of Emotional Distress (\u201cIIED\u201d). Under Louisiana law, a plaintiff claiming IIED must establish three elements: (1) that the conduct of the defendant was extreme and outrageous; (2) that the emotional distress suffered by the plaintiff was severe; and (3) that the defendant desired to inflict severe emotional distress or knew that severe emotional distress would be certain or substantially certain to result from his conduct.<footnotemark>18</footnotemark> \u201cIt is not enough that the defendant has acted with intent which is tortuous, or that he maliciously intended to inflict emotional distress.\u201d<footnotemark>19</footnotemark> \u201cThe conduct must be so outrageous in character, and so extreme in degree, as to go beyond all possible bounds of decency, and to be regarded as atrocious and utterly intolerable in a civilized community. Liability does not extend to mere insults, indignities, threats, annoyances, petty oppressions, or other trivialities.\u201d <footnotemark>20</footnotemark></p>\n<p id=\"b355-7\">The district court dismissed Ioppolo\u2019s IIED claim as to each defendant, finding that his allegations did not rise to the \u201chigh level of \u2018extreme and outrageous\u2019 conduct\u201d to constitute IIED under Louisiana law.</p>\n<p id=\"b355-12\">Ioppolo contends that the allegations in his Second Amended Complaint meet the pleading requirements because he \u201cprecisely pled\u201d each of the elements of IIED in his petitions and complaints against each defendant, sometimes using the exact language of the required elements. This contention is incorrect. \u201c[A] plaintiff\u2019s obligation to provide the \u2018grounds\u2019 of his \u2018entitle[ment] to relief requires more than labels and conclusions, and a formulaic recitation of the elements of a cause of action will not do____\u201d <footnotemark>21</footnotemark> Therefore, we must examine whether the alleged actions of the defendants are \u201cextreme and outrageous\u201d so as to state a claim for IIED under Louisiana law.</p>\n<p id=\"b355-14\">Rumana and Cuffe filed a complaint with the AANS, which was their right as members of the organization. Ioppolo complains, however, that Rumana and Cuffe participated in the proceedings before the PCC by giving false and misleading testimony to the committee. Ioppolo further alleges that Rumana and Cuffe then distributed the report of the PCC to Ioppolo\u2019s employers, colleagues, and the Louisiana State Board of Medical Examiners, prior to review by the Board of Directors of the AANS. Lastly, Ioppolo alleges that the AANS refused to police the abuses of its members, Rumana and Cuffe, and therefore became complieit in their conduct, and refused to communicate with the entities and individuals who received the PCC report prematurely sent out by Rumana and Cuffe.</p>\n<p id=\"b355-15\">The defendants\u2019 actions did not rise to the level of \u201cextreme\u201d or \u201coutrageous,\u201d <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"328\">*328</page-number>and the district court did not err in dismissing Ioppolo\u2019s IIED claim. The AANS, Rumana, and Cuffe merely followed a procedure established by the AANS for its members to report on potentially unprofessional conduct of a fellow member of the organization. The alleged violation of that procedure is Rumana and Cuffe\u2019s distribution of the PCC Report prior to the decision of the Board of Directors. This conduct, even if it were tortuous, is not sufficient to state a claim for IIED.<footnotemark>22</footnotemark> Liability for IIED requires much more than tortuous conduct \u2014 it requires conduct that goes \u201cbeyond all possible bounds of decency\u201d which can be \u201cregarded as atrocious and utterly intolerable in a civilized community.\u201d<footnotemark>23</footnotemark> The alleged conduct of defendants does not rise to this level. Therefore, we affirm the district court\u2019s dismissal of Ioppolo\u2019s IIED claim.</p>\n<p id=\"b356-4\">C.</p>\n<p id=\"b356-5\">Finally, we turn our attention to Ioppolo\u2019s claim for defamation. \u201cDefamation is a tort which involves the invasion of a person\u2019s interest in his or her reputation and good name.\u201d<footnotemark>24</footnotemark> In order to state a cause of action for defamation, a plaintiff must establish four elements: \u201c(1) a false and defamatory statement concerning another; (2) an unprivileged publication to a third party; (3) fault (negligence or greater) on the part of the publisher; and (4) resulting injury.\u201d<footnotemark>25</footnotemark> Because this is a case against a private individual, the fault required to establish liability is negligence.<footnotemark>26</footnotemark></p>\n<p id=\"b356-13\">\u201cDefamatory words are, by definition, words which tend to harm the reputation of another so as to lower the person in the estimation of the community, to deter others from associating or dealing with the person, or otherwise expose a person to contempt or ridicule.\u201d<footnotemark>27</footnotemark> Under Louisiana law, there are two categories of defamatory words: words that are defamatory <em>per se, </em>and words that are susceptible of defamatory meaning.<footnotemark>28</footnotemark> \u201cWords which expressly or implicitly accuse another of criminal conduct, or which by their very nature tend to injure one\u2019s personal or professional reputation, even without considering extrinsic facts or surrounding circumstances, are considered defamatory per se.\u201d<footnotemark>29</footnotemark> When a plaintiff proves publication of words that are defamatory <em>per se, </em>the elements of falsity and fault are presumed, and the burden shifts to the defendant to rebut this presumption.<footnotemark>30</footnotemark> Injury may also be presumed.<footnotemark>31</footnotemark> On the other hand, when the words are not defamatory per se, a plaintiff must prove all elements of his claim.<footnotemark>32</footnotemark></p>\n<p id=\"b357-4\"><page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"329\">*329</page-number>The district court adjudicated Ioppolo\u2019s defamation claims in three separate rulings. In August 2011, the court dismissed Ioppolo\u2019s defamation claim against the AANS for lack of publication because Ioppolo\u2019s complaint only alleges that the AANS published the report to its membership, not to third parties. Ioppolo fails to respond to the district court\u2019s ruling in his principal brief, but contends in his reply brief that the AANS is responsible for the subsequent publication of the PCC report by Rumana and Cuffe because it \u201cis a juridical entity and is only capable of acting through its members.\u201d After careful review, we agree with the district court\u2019s conclusion. The AANS followed its own internal protocol when it distributed the PCC Report to its membership. Pursuant to AANS procedure, the PCC Report was required to be distributed to the membership once Ioppolo appealed the decision to the Board of Directors. This distribution exclusively within the organization, and pursuant to the organization\u2019s rules, is comparable to an intra-corporate communication among employees within the course and scope of their employment. Under Louisiana law, such statements are not \u201cpublicized\u201d to third persons so as to constitute publication in a defamation claim.<footnotemark>33</footnotemark></p>\n<p id=\"b357-5\">The Louisiana case of <em>Doe v. Grant </em>illustrates this point.<footnotemark>34</footnotemark> In that case, the plaintiff, also a physician, performed an angioplasty procedure on a patient who died.<footnotemark>35</footnotemark> An Ad Hoc Committee of plaintiffs peers reviewed the ease and submitted its findings to a Medical Executive Committee (\u201cMEC\u201d).<footnotemark>36</footnotemark> The MEC concluded that plaintiffs performance was below the standard of care and unprofessional, and summarily suspended plaintiff from practicing medicine in the hospital.<footnotemark>37</footnotemark> The Board of Trustees of the hospital upheld the MEC\u2019s decision to suspend the plaintiff.<footnotemark>38</footnotemark> In response, the plaintiff brought defamation claims against his employer, the hospital, as well as his coemployees.<footnotemark>39</footnotemark> In his complaint, plaintiff pointed to three incidents which he claimed constituted \u201cpublication\u201d of the allegedly defamatory statements contained in the report: a) a doctor sharing the contents of the report with hospital staff; b) hospital administration telling nursing staff and others that plaintiffs privileges had been suspended; and c) a fellow doctor informing the Board of Trustees that the MEC had reaffirmed its decision to summarily suspend the plaintiff.<footnotemark>40</footnotemark> The court in <em>Grant </em>reasoned that these incidents did not amount to publication because they were necessary to ensure the safety of the patients at the hospital, and to inform other doctors and nurses that plaintiffs privileges had been suspended. Thus, the court concluded that these communications were protected.<footnotemark>41</footnotemark></p>\n<p id=\"b357-13\">The PCC Report in the instant case is comparable to the communications in <em>Grant. </em>Both involved the findings of professional committee hearings and the suspension of privileges. Both contained statements which were damaging to a physician\u2019s professional reputation. In each <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"330\">*330</page-number>case, the communications were distributed only to the parties as provided in the organization\u2019s rules, and were necessary to ensure effective operation of the organization. We agree with the district court\u2019s conclusion that Ioppolo failed to allege the required publication by the AANS, and his defamation claim against the AANS was properly dismissed.</p>\n<p id=\"b358-4\">We now turn to Ioppolo\u2019s defamation claim against Rumana and Cuffe. The district court dismissed as time barred that part of Ioppolo\u2019s defamation claim against Rumana and Cuffe related to the first distribution of the PCC Report. The PCC Report was initially distributed on December 28, 2004, and Ioppolo filed suit more than one year later, on February 9, 2006. Ioppolo\u2019s claims based on this distribution are therefore time barred on their face under Louisiana\u2019s one-year statutory limit.<footnotemark>42</footnotemark> However, this does not absolve Rumana and Cuffe from liability for defamation. As discussed in detail below, Rumana and Cuffe later republished the PCC Report to third parties in March and April 2005, less than one year before Ioppolo filed suit. Under Louisiana law, \u201ceach and every publication or communication to a third person constitutes a separate cause of action.\u201d<footnotemark>43</footnotemark> Therefore, Ioppolo maintains a timely cause of action for defamation against Rumana and Cuffe based on their subsequent distribution of the letter and the PCC Report.</p>\n<p id=\"b358-5\">In its third and final ruling addressing the defamation claims, the district court, on summary judgment, dismissed Ioppolo\u2019s claims against Rumana and Cuffe based on their distribution of the PCC Report to the Louisiana State Board of Medical Examiners (\u201cLSBME\u201d) and the LWCC.</p>\n<p id=\"b358-10\">Ioppolo argues that this distribution constitutes defamation. According to Ioppolo, the following statements by Rumana and Cuffe in their letter were defamatory: (1) that Ioppolo gave \u201cfalse testimony which was not supported by any medical literature in this case\u201d; (2) that Ioppolo was \u201ca biased expert, not an impartial one\u201d; (3) that Ioppolo\u2019s testimony that there was an extradural clot compressing the spinal cord was incorrect, highly damaging, and substandard for a neurological surgeon; (4) that the verdict in the Florida case \u201cthreatened to bankrupt the Tallahassee Neurological Center ...\u201d; (5) that Ioppolo offered an overoptimistic prognostication which was \u201cmisleading to the jury\u201d; (6) that Ioppolo\u2019s trial testimony was \u201cscientifically baseless and irresponsible advocacy\u201d; and (7) that the PCC considers Ioppolo\u2019s conduct unprofessional and egregious. Additionally, Ioppolo contends that several statements contained within the PCC report were also defamatory upon publication to third parties. Ioppolo also argues that the statements by Rumana and Cuffe are defamatory per se because they bear negatively on his \u201cprofessionalism, knowledge as a physician, propensity for truthfulness, morality, and responsibility as an expert.\u201d</p>\n<p id=\"b358-11\">We affirm the district court\u2019s dismissal for the following reasons. First, the PCC Report itself is a statement of opinion, not fact. The First Amendment provides \u201ca defense against defamation actions for expressions of opinion about matters of public concern made without knowing or reckless falsity.\u201d<footnotemark>44</footnotemark> The PCC <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"331\">*331</page-number>Report was rendered after the committee heard evidence, resolved conflicts, made credibility calls, and reached a decision similar to an opinion issued by a court. (The PCC decision was affirmed by the Board of Directors on appeal.) The Report is littered with phrases and statements which clearly indicate it is a statement of opinion.<footnotemark>45</footnotemark> Moreover, the veracity and reliability of expert medical testimony given during trial is a matter of public concern because it is a critical part of the efficient administration of justice<footnotemark>46</footnotemark> Second, the letter distributed by Rumana and Cuffe to the LSBME and LWCC which accompanied the PCC Report is almost entirely a summary of the PCC Report, and often repeats or paraphrases language in the Report. Specifically, the statements above numbered 2, 3, 5, 6, are essentially identical to conclusions reached in the PCC Report. Statements 1 and 7 are generalizations of the PCC\u2019s findings in its report.<footnotemark>47</footnotemark> The statement that Ioppolo\u2019s testimony was false, incorrect, and misleading based on his interpretation of the CT scan is an opinion based on a physician\u2019s expertise as a neurosurgeon. Use of the word \u201cfalse\u201d in the statement does not change its nature, and is not substantively different than stating that Ioppolo\u2019s testimony was \u201cincorrect,\u201d \u201cbaseless,\u201d or \u201cmisleading.\u201d This is true even though Drs. Rumana and Cuffe express their views that Ioppolo\u2019s interpretation is unquestionably and flagrantly off-base. This is still an opinion.</p>\n<p id=\"b359-9\">Even if we assume <em>arguendo </em>that the PCC Report and the letter by Rumana and Cuffe do not constitute opinion, they are still immune from a claim for defamation if the statements are subject to a qualified privilege. \u201cIn Louisiana, privilege is a defense to a defamation action.\u201d<footnotemark>48</footnotemark> \u201cThe doctrine of privilege rests upon the notion that sometimes, as a matter of public policy, in order to encourage the free communication of views in certain defined instances, one is justified in communicating defamatory information to others without incurring liability.\u201d<footnotemark>49</footnotemark> \u201cThe elements of a conditional privilege have been described as good faith, an interest to be <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"332\">*332</page-number>upheld and a statement limited in scope to this purpose, a proper occasion, and publication in the proper manner to the proper parties only.\u201d<footnotemark>50</footnotemark> \u201cThe practical effect of the assertion of the conditional or qualified privilege is to rebut the plaintiffs allegation of fault and to place the burden of proof on the plaintiff to establish abuse of the privilege.\u201d<footnotemark>51</footnotemark></p>\n<p id=\"b360-4\">Determining whether a qualified privilege exists involves a two-step process. \u201cFirst, it must be determined whether the attending circumstances of a communication occasion a qualified privilege.\u201d<footnotemark>52</footnotemark> Second, we determine \u201cwhether the privilege was abused, which requires that the grounds for abuse \u2014 malice or lack of good faith \u2014 be examined.\u201d<footnotemark>53</footnotemark> \u201cWhile the first step is generally determined by the court as a matter of law, the second step of determining abuse of a conditional privilege or malice is generally a fact question for the jury \u2018[ujnless only one conclusion can be drawn from the evidence.\u2019 \u201d<footnotemark>54</footnotemark></p>\n<p id=\"ADa\">A Louisiana court has applied the qualified privilege in \u201cattending circumstances\u201d similar to this case. In <em>Elmer v. Coplin, </em>the defendant, an attorney, wrote a letter to the National Conference of Bar Examiners which accused the plaintiff, an applicant to the District of Columbia Bar, of participating in the fraudulent misrepresentation of the assets and liabilities of a company the plaintiff represented.<footnotemark>55</footnotemark> Despite finding that defendant\u2019s letter was defamatory <em>per se </em>after a bench trial, the court upheld the dismissal of plaintiff\u2019s defamation claim because defendant was protected by the qualified privilege.<footnotemark>56</footnotemark> The <em>Elmer </em>court found the privilege applied even though the defendant\u2019s statements in that case were ultimately found in a separate proceeding to be false.<footnotemark>57</footnotemark></p>\n<p id=\"b360-12\">In addition, Louisiana courts have held that a qualified privilege is generally necessary for statements made when reviewing the fitness of medical doctors to practice their profession.<footnotemark>58</footnotemark> Although the instant case does not directly concern Dr. Ioppolo\u2019s fitness to practice medicine, it does involve his ability to provide competent expert medical testimony based upon his qualifications as a neurosurgeon. The competency of such testimony implicates his ability to practice, and also affects the public\u2019s interest in the proper administration of the judicial system. Thus, the circumstances of this case warrant application of the qualified privilege.</p>\n<p id=\"b360-13\">Moving to the second part of the test, we find no sign of abuse of the qualified privilege by Rumana and Cuffe. Ioppolo <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"333\">*333</page-number>produced no summary judgment evidence tending to show that Rumana and Cuffe knew their statements were false, or acted with reckless disregard as to their truth, when they wrote their letter and distributed it to the LSBME and LWCC. Ioppolo asserts that Rumana and Cuffe\u2019s initial complaint to the AANS and their testimony during the hearing before the PCC were \u201cmisleading, speculative, false and prejudicial in nature.\u201d Therefore, according to Ioppolo, Rumana and Cuffe\u2019s letter which accompanied the PCC Report was defamatory and constituted an abuse of the qualified privilege because it was based upon these prior false statements.</p>\n<p id=\"b361-5\">\u201cThe conditional privilege is abused, and thus inapposite, when the \u2018defendant steps outside the scope of the privilege, or abuses the occasion.\u2019 \u201d<footnotemark>59</footnotemark> The defendant abuses the privilege when he acts with knowledge of falsity, or reckless disregard for the truth.<footnotemark>60</footnotemark> The initial complaint and testimony are not shown to be knowingly false. In fact, these statements were subsequently corroborated by the PCC Report after an extensive investigation. Moreover, lop-polo\u2019s allegation that the PCC Report, and the letter which accompanied it, were based on the prior false statements of Rumana and Cuffe, fails to tell the whole story. The PCC issued its report following an adversarial hearing during which <em>both </em>sides testified and presented evidence; it was not an <em>ex parte </em>proceeding. That the PCC decided in favor of Rumana and Cuffe supports the notion that they had a reasonable basis for their allegations. The record does not show that Rumana and Cuffe\u2019s letter \u201cis fabricated ..., the product of [their] imagination, or is so inherently improbable that only a reckless man would have put it in circulation.\u201d<footnotemark>61</footnotemark> Ioppolo has failed to show that Rumana and Cuffe either knew their statements were false or acted with reckless disregard for their truth. Thus, even assuming <em>arguendo </em>that the statements made by Rumana and Cuffe in their letter are not statements of opinion, the summary judgment record supports their argument that they were entitled to a qualified privilege.</p>\n<p id=\"b361-9\">IV.</p>\n<p id=\"b361-10\">For the reasons stated above, we affirm the district court\u2019s dismissal of Dr. Ioppolo\u2019s action against the AANS, and Drs.

I write separately because, in my view, Drs. Rumana and Cuffe were not entitled to summary judgment on Dr. Ioppolo\u2019s defamation claims against them.</p>\n<p id=\"b361-15\">This case arises out of the expert testimony that Dr. Ioppolo offered against Dr. Vogter \u2014 a former business partner of Drs. Rumana and Cuffe \u2014 in a medical malpractice case. Dr. Ioppolo offered testimony suggesting that Dr. Vogter did not follow proper hospital policy in a case where a ten-year-old boy ultimately became quadriplegic. Specifically, Dr. Ioppolo testified <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"334\">*334</page-number>that he reviewed CT films which showed hematoma on the boy\u2019s CT scan. Dr. Ioppolo further testified that the hematoma compressed the boy\u2019s spinal cord, and that standard hospital policy suggested that Dr. Vogter should have given the boy steroids and performed a decompressive surgery on the hematoma.</p>\n<p id=\"b362-4\">Drs. Ioppolo, Rumana, and Cuffe were all members of the professional association AANS. After the malpractice case settled, Drs. Rumana and Cuffe filed a complaint against Dr. Ioppolo with the AANS\u2019s Professional Conduct Committee (\u201cPCC\u201d) regarding his testimony against Dr. Vogter. In their complaint, they alleged that Dr. Ioppolo\u2019s testimony was \u201cfalse, inaccurate and constituted a violation of the AANS Expert Witness Rules.\u201d Both Drs. Rumana and Cuffe subsequently participated in the PCC\u2019s proceedings against Dr. Ioppolo. According to Dr. Ioppolo, Drs. Rumana and Cuffe\u2019s testimony included \u201cprejudicial and unsubstantiated allegations about the factual background\u201d of the malpractice case. For example, the physicians testified that no doctor could have seen a hematoma compressing the boy\u2019s spinal cord on a CT scan. Dr. Ioppolo asserts that these statements were later incorporated into the PCC\u2019s resulting report. The PCC report found that Dr. Ioppolo \u201cdemonstrated a lack of adequate subject matter knowledge [in the malpractice case] and acted as an advocate for the plaintiff\u2019s attorney rather than as an unbiased witness.\u201d The AANS Board reviewed the PCC report, and unanimously approved a two-year suspension for Dr. Ioppolo.</p>\n<p id=\"b362-6\">Before Dr. Ioppolo had a chance to make use of the appeals process available within the AANS for such reports, Drs. Rumana and Cuffe mailed copies of the PCC report to the Louisiana State Board of Medical Examiners (\u201cLSMB\u201d) and the Louisiana Workers\u2019 Compensation Corporation (\u201cLWCC\u201d). These reports were accompanied by letters from Drs. Rumana and Cuffe purporting to summarize the PCC report and including a number of negative statements about Dr. Ioppolo. For example, one letter stated that \u201cDr. Ioppolo gave false, misleading expert testimony;\u201d that he \u201cwas a biased expert, not an impartial one;\u201d and that his testimony was \u201cscientifically baseless and irresponsible advocacy.\u201d Dr. Ioppolo then filed suit against the AANS and Drs. Rumana and Cuffe alleging, among other things, that the statements in the report and letters were defamatory.<footnotemark>1</footnotemark></p>\n<p id=\"b362-7\">The panel opinion holds that the PCC report and the accompanying letters sent by Drs. Rumana and Cuffe were statements of opinion, and that even if they were not, the statements would still be immune from a defamation claim because they are subject to a qualified privilege. I respectfully disagree.</p>\n<p id=\"b362-8\">\u201cThe distinction drawn between opinion and statement of fact has long been important at common law because most states restricted the privilege of fair comment to expressions of opinion.\u201d <em>Mashburn v. Collin, </em>355 So.2d 879, 885 (La.1977) (citation omitted).</p>\n<blockquote id=\"b362-9\">Although difficult to state in abstract terms, as a practical matter, the crucial difference between statement of fact and opinion depends upon whether ordinary <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"335\">*335</page-number>persons hearing or reading the matter complained of would be likely to understand it as an expression of the speaker\u2019s or writer\u2019s opinion, or as a statement of existing fact.</blockquote>\n<p id=\"b363-5\"><em>Id. </em>(citation omitted).</p>\n<p id=\"b363-6\">I agree with the panel opinion that the PCC report contains a number of opinions, and that such opinions are protected from defamation claims by the First Amendment. <em>See id. </em>(quoting <em>N.Y. Times Co. v. Sullivan, </em>376 U.S. 254, 283, 84 S.Ct. 710, 11 L.Ed.2d 686 (1964)). However, not all of the statements that Dr. Ioppolo complains of can be fairly characterized as opinions. For example, Drs. Rumana and Cuffe\u2019s letter to the LSMB stated that \u201cDr. Ioppolo gave false testimony which was not supported by any medical literature in this case.\u201d An ordinary person reading this statement would likely understand this to be a statement of fact: Either Dr. Ioppolo did, or did not, give false testimony. Only a fact can be true or false. Indeed, as Dr. Cuffe himself notes, two of the synonyms for \u201cfalse\u201d are \u201ccontrary to fact\u201d and \u201ccounterfactual.\u201d Thus, the statement that Dr. Ioppolo gave false testimony is best characterized as a statement of fact, rather than an opinion.</p>\n<p id=\"b363-9\">Because not all of Drs. Rumana and Cuffe\u2019s statements were protected opinions, I next turn to whether their statements were covered by qualified privilege. \u201c[T]he analysis for determining whether a conditional privilege exists involves a two-step process.\u201d<footnotemark>2</footnotemark> <em>Kennedy, </em>935 So.2d at 682. \u201cFirst, it must be determined whether the attending circumstances of a communication occasion a qualified privilege.\u201d <em>Id. </em>\u201cAttending circumstances\u201d include the \u201ccommunication of alleged wrongful acts to the officials authorized to protect the public\u201d such as when a member of the public alerts the police of potentially dangerous or criminal activity. <em>Id. </em>Louisiana has also recognized a qualified privilege for \u201ccommunications between an employer and the Department of Employment Security\u201d regarding the reasons for an employee\u2019s termination. <em>Watson v. Willis-Knighton Med. Ctr., </em>93 So.3d 855, 860 (La.App. 2 Cir.2012) (citing <em>Kosmitis v. Bailey, </em>685 So.2d 1177 (La.App. 2d Cir.1996)).</p>\n<p id=\"b363-10\">\u201cThe second step of the analysis is a determination of whether the privilege was abused, which requires that the grounds for abuse \u2014 malice or lack of good faith\u2014 <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"336\">*336</page-number>be examined.\u201d <em>Id. </em>\u201cWhile the first step is generally determined by the court as a matter of law, the second step of determining abuse of a conditional privilege or malice is generally a fact question for the jury [ujnless only one conclusion can be drawn from the evidence.\u201d <em>Id. </em>(internal quotation marks and citations omitted); <em>see also </em>William Lloyd Prosser &amp; W. Page Keeton, Prosser &amp; Keeton On Torts \u00a7 115 at 835 (5th ed.1984).</p>\n<p id=\"b364-4\">Even assuming <em>arguendo </em>that Drs. Rumana and Cuffe met the first step in the qualified privilege test, the district court should not have granted summary judgment because a fact issue remains as to whether Drs. Rumana and Cuffe abused the privilege by acting with actual malice. The practical effect of asserting a conditional or qualified privilege is to rebut the plaintiff\u2019s allegations of malice and to place the burden of proof on the plaintiff to establish an abuse of the privilege.<footnotemark>3</footnotemark> <em>Kennedy, </em>935 So.2d at 683. Establishing an abuse of privilege requires the plaintiff to prove that the defendants acted with actual malice-that is, with knowing falsity, or reckless disregard for the truth. <em>Id. </em>at 685.</p>\n<p id=\"b364-5\">Dr. Rumana argues that he and Dr. Cuffe \u201chad every reason to believe the PCC report was \u2018true\u2019 \u201d because it was the result of the PCC\u2019s evidentiary proceeding against Dr. Ioppolo. But as Dr. Ioppolo notes, the PCC report was based in part on Drs. Rumana and Cuffe\u2019s own testimony. If, as Dr. Ioppolo asserts, Drs. Rumana and Cuffe knew that their testimony and allegations were untrue, then they certainly had reasons to doubt the veracity of the resulting PCC report. In <em>Kennedy, </em>the Louisiana Supreme Court explained that summary judgment was appropriate because \u201cthere is no allegation and certainly no evidence to support a contention\u201d that the defendants knew their statements were false. <em>Id. </em>at 687-88; <em>see also id. </em>at 688 (\u201cIn fact, Kennedy\u2019s petition alleges only negligence on the part of [the defendants].\u201d). By contrast, the very heart of Dr. Ioppolo\u2019s case is his contention that Drs. Rumana and Cuffe gave the PCC false information in order to harm him.</p>\n<p id=\"b364-8\">The summary judgment record included Dr. Ioppolo\u2019s affidavit, which states:</p>\n<blockquote id=\"b364-9\">At the [PCC] meeting, [Drs.] Rumana and Cuffe submitted an extensive presentation which was misleading, speculative, false and prejudicial in nature, and which included hearsay, matters not in the medical records and representations which were simply untrue.</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b364-10\">Apparently emboldened by the preliminary report and in complete disregard for the by-laws of the AANS to the appeal, [Drs.] Rumana and Cuffe commenced a systematic disbursement of the report of the PCC to my employers, colleagues and others, sending facsimiles to these entities, attaching copies of the opinion which was based upon their falsehoods and misrepresentations.</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b364-11\">They included a copy of the report, though they knew that those findings were disputed, that they were not final and that they were not allowed [to] be made public.</blockquote>\n<p id=\"b365-4\"><page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"337\">*337</page-number>The record also included the transcript of Drs. Rumana and Cuffe\u2019s testimony before the PCC. Dr. Ioppolo identified a number of statements that the two doctors made, which Dr. Ioppolo claims were unsupported by any evidence. A reasonable jury could find that that making such unsupported statements, and then distributing a report based on those statements, demonstrated a reckless disregard for the truth.<footnotemark>4</footnotemark> Dr. Ioppolo also submitted an affidavit from the President and CEO of the LWCC, Kristin Wall, stating:</p>\n<blockquote id=\"b365-5\">I found it especially interesting that the complaints against Dr. Ioppolo were made by the defendant doctors in that case after they had settled their case and after he had been qualified to testify by the court and subjected to cross-examination by the remaining defendants.</blockquote>\n<p id=\"b365-6\">Viewed in the light most favorable to Dr. Ioppolo, these statements create a fact issue as to whether Drs. Rumana and Cuffe abused their qualified privilege. In addition to these affidavits, Dr. Ioppolo\u2019s position could also be supported by the fact that Drs. Rumana and Cuffe chose to send out the PCC report before Dr. Ioppolo had a chance to exhaust the AANS appeals process and challenge the report\u2019s findings. This refusal to wait and ensure that any errors in the report were corrected could serve as evidence that they showed a reckless disregard for the truth. Because more than \u201cone conclusion can be drawn from the evidence,\u201d the district court should not have granted summary judgment on Dr. Ioppolo\u2019s defamation claim against Drs. Rumana and Cuffe. <em>Kennedy, </em>935 So.2d at 682.</p>\n<footnote label=\"1\">\n<p id=\"b362-5\">. Attacks, such as these, on an expert witness\u2019s professional standing can also negatively impact the ability of plaintiffs to bring medical malpractice cases by making physicians less willing to testify against other members of their profession. <em>See, e.g., </em>James A. Lowe &amp; Mark L. Wakefield, Am. L. Prod. Liab.3d \u00a7 68:33 (noting that finding an expert witness in a medical malpractice case is \"usually a hair-pulling experience\u201d).</p>\n</footnote>\n<footnote label=\"2\">\n<p id=\"b363-7\">. The district court incorrectly applied an earlier standard for qualified privilege based on our decision in <em>Rouly v. Enserch Corp., </em>835 F.2d 1127, 1130 (5th Cir. 1988). Since that decision, however, the Louisiana Supreme Court has adopted a new test, which we must apply. <em>See Vandenbark v. Owens-Ill. Glass Co., </em>311 U.S. 538, 61 S.Ct. 347, 85 L.Ed. 327 (1941); Charles Alan Wright &amp; Mary Kay Kane, 20 Fed. Prac. &amp; Proc.

As the Louisiana Supreme Court explained:</p>\n<blockquote id=\"b363-8\">Early appellate court decisions in Louisiana characterized the conditional or qualified privilege as applying if the communication is made (a) in good faith, (b) on any subject matter in which the person communicating has an interest or in reference to which he has a duly, (c) to a person having a corresponding interest or duty. Under this formulation, which finds its genesis in Madison's citation of a passage from an encyclopedia, courts typically focused on the requirements of good faith and proper publication to determine in the first instance if the privilege applied. In <em>Smith v. Our Lady of the Lake Hospital, Inc., </em>[639 So.2d 730 (La.1994)], we eschewed that approach [in favor of the two-step analysis].</blockquote>\n<p id=\"b363-13\"><em>Kennedy v.
