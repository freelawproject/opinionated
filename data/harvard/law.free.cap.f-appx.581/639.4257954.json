Torrecillas-Torres\u2019s request for oral argument is denied.</p>\n</footnote>\n<opinion data-order=\"10\" data-type=\"opinion\" id=\"x999-2\" type=\"majority\">\n<p id=\"b667-22\">MEMORANDUM <footnotemark>**</footnotemark></p>\n<p id=\"b667-23\">Juan Francisco Torrecillas-Torres appeals from the district court\u2019s judgment and challenges his guilty-plea conviction and 120-month sentence for conspiracy to possess with intent to distribute methamphetamine, in violation of 21 U.S.C. \u00a7\u00a7 841(a)(1), (b)(l)(A)(viii), 846. Pursuant to <em>Anders v. California, </em>386 U.S. 738, 87 S.Ct. 1396, 18 L.Ed.2d 493 (1967), Torrecillas-Torres\u2019s counsel has filed a brief stating that there are no grounds for relief, along with a motion to withdraw as counsel of record. Torrecillas-Torres has filed a pro se supplemental brief. No answering brief has been filed.</p>\n<p id=\"b667-24\">Torrecillas-Torres has waived his right to appeal his conviction and sentence. Our independent review of the record pursuant to <em>Penson v. Ohio, </em>488 U.S. 75, 80, 109 S.Ct. 346, 102 L.Ed.2d 300 (1988), discloses no arguable issue as to the validity of the waiver. <em>See United States v. Watson, </em>582 F.3d 974, 986-88 (9th Cir.2009). We accordingly dismiss the appeal. <em>See id. </em>at 988.</p>\n<p id=\"b667-25\">Torrecillas-Torres\u2019s contention that the appeal waiver is unenforceable is unpersuasive. We decline to consider Torrecillas-Torres\u2019s claim of ineffective assistance of trial counsel because the record is insufficiently developed to evaluate that claim on direct appeal, and Torrecillas-Torres\u2019s legal representation was not so inadequate as to obviously deny his right to counsel. <em>See United States v. Rahman, </em>642 F.3d 1257, 1259-60 (9th Cir.2011).</p>\n<p id=\"b668-3\"><page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"640\">*640</page-number>Counsel\u2019s motion to withdraw is GRANTED.</p>\n<p id=\"b668-4\">DISMISSED.</p>\n<footnote label=\"**\">\n<p id=\"b667-26\"><em> </em>This disposition is not appropriate for publication and is not precedent except as provided by 9th Cir.
