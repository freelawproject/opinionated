We have jurisdiction under 8 U.S.C. \u00a7 1252. We review for substantial evidence the agency\u2019s factual findings, <em>Singh v. Gonzales, </em>439 F.3d 1100, 1113 (9th Cir.2006), and we deny the petition for review.</p>\n<p id=\"b698-22\">Marin-Molina does not claim he was tortured in the past, but fears torture in Mexico primarily due his grandfather\u2019s anti-drug activities as municipal president over 20 years ago, and because he has tattoos. Substantial evidence supports the agency\u2019s denial of Marin-Molina\u2019s CAT claim because he failed to establish it is more likely than not he would be tortured if returned to Mexico. <em>See Zheng v. Holder, </em>644 F.3d 829, 835-36 (9th Cir.2011) (concluding the record did not compel reversal of the agency\u2019s denial of CAT where the petitioner\u2019s claims of possible torture remained speculative). We reject Marin-Molina\u2019s contentions that the agency ignored evidence, <em>see Almaghzar v. Gonzales, </em>457 F.3d 915, 922 (9th Cir.2006), or otherwise erred in analyzing his claim.</p>\n<p id=\"b698-23\">PETITION FOR REVIEW DENIED.</p>\n<footnote label=\"**\">\n<p id=\"b698-25\"> This disposition is not appropriate for publication and is not precedent except as provided by 9th Cir.
