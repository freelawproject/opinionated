Our jurisdiction is governed by 8 U.S.C. \u00a7 1252. We review for substantial evidence factual findings, <em>Wakkary v. Holder, </em>558 F.3d 1049, 1056 (9th Cir.2009), and we review de novo due process claims, <em>Liu v. Holder, </em>640 F.3d 918, 930 (9th Cir.2011). We deny in part and dismiss in part the petition for review.</p>\n<p id=\"b643-8\">Substantial evidence supports the agency\u2019s finding that, even considering her son\u2019s experiences, Ali did not suffer harm rising to the level of past persecution. <em>See Wakkary, </em>558 F.3d at 1059-60 (concluding that petitioner\u2019s beating, robbery, and confrontation with a threatening mob did not rise to the level of persecution); <em>Gormley v. Ashcroft, </em>364 F.3d 1172, 1178 (9th Cir. 2004) (\u201cmere economic disadvantage alone does not rise to the level of persecution\u201d). Substantial evidence also supports the finding that, even under a disfavored group analysis, Ali has not established sufficient individualized risk of harm to support a well-founded fear of persecution. <em>See Halim v. Holder, </em>590 F.3d 971, 979 (9th Cir.2009). We reject Ali\u2019s contention that the agency misapplied the disfavored group analysis. Thus, Ali\u2019s asylum claim fails.</p>\n<p id=\"b643-11\">Because Ali failed to meet the lower burden of proof for asylum, it follows that she has not met the higher standard for withholding of removal. <em>See Zehatye v. Gonzales, </em>453 F.3d 1182, 1190 (9th Cir. 2006).</p>\n<p id=\"b643-12\">Substantial evidence supports the agency\u2019s denial of CAT relief because Ali failed to establish it is more likely than not that she will be tortured by or with the acquiescence of the government if returned to Indonesia. <em>See Wakkary, </em>558 F.3d at 1067-68.</p>\n<p id=\"b643-13\">We reject Ali\u2019s due process claims. <em>See Lata v. INS, </em>204 F.3d 1241, 1246 (9th Cir.2000) (petitioner must show error and prejudice to establish a due process violation).</p>\n<p id=\"b643-14\">Ali\u2019s motion to submit this case to a merits panel is denied as moot.</p>\n<p id=\"b643-15\">Finally, according to Ali\u2019s opening brief, Teddy Lingga has returned to Indonesia and has abandoned his claim. <em>See </em>8 C.F.R. \u00a7 1208.8. Pursuant to Ali\u2019s request, we dismiss the petition for review as to Teddy Lingga.</p>\n<p id=\"b643-16\">PETITION FOR REVIEW DENIED in part; DISMISSED in part.</p>\n<footnote label=\"**\">\n<p id=\"b643-9\"> This disposition is not appropriate for publication and is not precedent except as provided by 9th Cir.
