GORSUCH, Circuit Judge.</author>\n<p id=\"b750-20\">Having already served his sentence and no longer able to obtain recourse through habeas, Mr. Nowlin now seeks a writ of coram nobis to set aside his federal assault convictions. <em>See generally Chaidez v. United States, </em>\u2014 U.S. -, 133 S.Ct. 1103, 1106 n. 1, 185 L.Ed.2d 149 (2013). Those convictions arose under 18 U.S.C. \u00a7 1153, a statute that makes it a federal offense for \u201c[a]ny Indian\u201d to commit certain offenses against \u201canother Indian or other person\u201d within \u201cIndian country.\u201d Mr. Nowlin contends that he is entitled to relief because insufficient evidence exists of his status as an \u201cIndian.\u201d</p>\n<p id=\"b751-4\"><page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"723\">*723</page-number>The district court denied the petition and so must we. A writ of coram nobis is an \u201cextraordinary remedy.\u201d <em>United States v. Morgan, </em>346 U.S. 502, 511, 74 S.Ct. 247, 98 L.Ed. 248 (1954). For this reason, the writ will issue only to correct a \u201cjurisdictional or constitutional\u201d error that has \u201cresulted] in a complete miscarriag\u00e9 of justice.\u201d <em>Klein v. United States, </em>880 F.2d 250, 253 (10th Cir.1989). No such infirmity exists here.</p>\n<p id=\"b751-5\">Our case law employs a two-part test to determine who is an \u201cIndian\u201d under \u00a7 1153: a person must (1) have \u201csome Indian blood\u201d and (2) be \u201crecognized as an Indian by a tribe or by the federal government.\u201d <em>United States v. Prentiss, </em>273 F.3d 1277, 1280 (10th Cir.2001). Mr. Nowlin argues that the first half of this test was not met. But his plea colloquy established that his mother is an enrolled member of the Shoshone tribe. And, as a previous panel recognized in an unrelated case involving Mr. Nowlin, the fact that one of his parents was \u201cclearly identified as an Indian\u201d is enough to satisfy this part of the test. <em>United States v. Nowlin, </em>555 Fed.Appx. 820, 823 (10th Cir.2014) (quoting <em>United States v. Maggi, </em>598 F.3d 1073, 1077 (9th Cir.2010)) (internal quotation mark omitted).</p>\n<p id=\"b751-6\">Neither can Mr. Nowlin succeed in his argument that the Eastern Shoshone lacked federal recognition at the time of his crime. <em>See id. </em>at 823 n. 1 (noting that <em>Prentiss </em>\u201cimplicitly requires federal recognition of the defendant\u2019s tribe\u201d). Mr. Nowlin points out that the Tenth Circuit did not remark upon the tribe\u2019s federal recognition until a 2012 decision. <em>See N. Arapaho Tribe v. Harnsberger, </em>697 F.3d 1272, 1275 (10th Cir.2012). That\u2019s true enough, but tribal recognition doesn\u2019t require a judicial decision; it can flow from executive action. And the government has recognized this tribe since well before the events of this case. <em>See, e.g., </em>Indian Entities Recognized and Eligible to Receive Services from the United States Bureau of Indian Affairs, 60 Fed.Reg. 9250, 9253 (February 16, 1995) (listing the \u201cShoshone Tribe of the Wind River Reservation\u201d).</p>\n<p id=\"b751-9\">Mr. Nowlin\u2019s motion to proceed in forma pauperis is denied and the judgment of the district court is affirmed. He is reminded of his obligation to pay the filing fee in full.</p>\n<footnote label=\"*\">\n<p id=\"b750-6\"> After examining the briefs and appellate record, this panel has determined unanimously that oral argument would not materially assist the determination of this appeal. <em>See </em>Fed. R.App. P. 34(a)(2) and 10th Cir. R. 34.1(G). The case is therefore ordered submitted without oral argument. This order and judgment is not binding precedent except under the doctrines of law of the case, res judicata, and collateral estoppel. It may be cited, however, for its persuasive value consistent with Fed. R.App. P. 32.1 and 10th Cir. R. 32.1.</p>\n</footnote>\n</opinion>\n</casebody>\n",
