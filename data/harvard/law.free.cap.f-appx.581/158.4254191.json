After a four-day jury trial, Viney was convicted of interference with interstate commerce by robbery (\u201cHobbs Act robbery\u201d), in violation of 18 U.S.C. \u00a7 1951(a), conspiracy to interfere with interstate commerce by committing a Hobbs Act robbery, in violation of 18 U.S.C. \u00a7 1951(a), and using and carrying a firearm during and in relation to a crime of violence, in violation of 18 U.S.C. \u00a7 924(c)(1)(A). Viney now raises three issues on appeal, which we address in turn.<footnotemark>1</footnotemark></p>\n<p id=\"b186-24\">First, Viney argues that he should have been granted a judgment of acquittal due to insufficient evidence pursuant to Federal Rule of Criminal Procedure 29 and should have been granted a new trial pursuant to Federal Rule of Criminal Procedure 33. In reviewing a Rule 29 motion for a judgment of acquittal, \u201cwe view the evidence in the light most favorable to the prosecution and sustain the verdict unless it is clear that no rational trier of fact could have found the essential elements of the crime beyond a reasonable doubt.\u201d<footnotemark>2</footnotemark> The standard is similarly exacting under Rule 33, where a district court should or<page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"159\">*159</page-number>der a new trial \u201conly if it believes that there is a serious danger that a miscarriage of justice has occurred \u2014 that is, that an innocent person has been convicted.\u201d<footnotemark>3</footnotemark></p>\n<p id=\"A_\">The District Court\u2019s denial of each motion was proper. The record contains ample evidence of Viney\u2019s guilt, including the detailed testimony of the complaining witness, Roosevelt Haulcy II (\u201cHaulcy\u201d); Haulcy\u2019s immediate identification of \u201cMarc\u201d as the assailant on the day of the crime; Haulcy\u2019s testimony about the firearm used by Viney in commission of the crime; and, a document in Viney\u2019s pocket that listed a number of individuals\u2019 names, home addresses and automobile descriptions, that had Haulcy\u2019s information highlighted in yellow, and that listed, under the header of \u201cWork Tools,\u201d assault rifles, handguns, a speed loader, handcuffs, a GPS system and bulletproof vests.<footnotemark>4</footnotemark></p>\n<p id=\"b187-5\">Moreover, there was sufficient evidence regarding the robbery\u2019s effect on interstate commerce, including that Viney stole alcohol produced in France; that the Tavern served alcohol produced in France; that the Tavern served alcohol produced in other states; and, that the Tavern served customers from outside Pennsylvania.<footnotemark>5</footnotemark> Accordingly, finding ample evidence to support the jury\u2019s verdict, we reject Viney\u2019s Rule 29 and Rule 38 appeals.</p>\n<p id=\"b187-13\">Second, Viney argues that requiring only a <em>de minimis </em>effect on interstate commerce for Hobbs Act robberies is unconstitutional. As Viney acknowledges, however, our controlling precedent forecloses such an argument.<footnotemark>6</footnotemark></p>\n<p id=\"b187-14\">Third, Viney argues that our model jury instructions for Hobbs Act robberies are unconstitutional, because they instruct a jury that only proof of a <em>de minimis </em>effect is necessary to establish the requisite effect on interstate commerce. We have previously considered and rejected this argument.<footnotemark>7</footnotemark> We do so again here.</p>\n<p id=\"b187-15\">In sum, we conclude that Viney\u2019s conviction was supported by ample evidence, and that our precedent on the effect a Hobbs Act robbery need have on interstate commerce is well settled. Accordingly, we affirm.</p>\n<footnote label=\"*\">\n<p id=\"b186-16\"> This disposition is not an opinion of the full court and pursuant to I.O.P. 5.7 does not constitute binding precedent.</p>\n</footnote>\n<footnote label=\"1\">\n<p id=\"b186-17\">. We have jurisdiction to hear the appeal under 28 U.S.C. \u00a7 1291.
