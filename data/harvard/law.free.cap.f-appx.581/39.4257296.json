The Plan is an employee welfare benefit plan under Section 3(1) of the Employee Retirement Income Security Act of 1974 (\u201cERISA\u201d), 29 U.S.C. \u00a7 1002(1). When Judith\u2019s death benefits were denied, Raymond sued the Plan Administrator, Life Insurance Company of North America (\u201cLINA\u201d), LINA\u2019s parent company Cigna Group Insurance (\u201cCigna\u201d), and Bank of America under \u00a7 502(a)(1)(B) of ERISA, 29 U.S.C. \u00a7 1132(a)(1)(B), which permits a plan participant or beneficiary to bring an action \u201cto recover benefits due to him under the terms of his plan.\u201d</p>\n<p id=\"b68-8\">The district court issued a memorandum and order on January 10, 2013 (the \u201cOrder\u201d) that, as relevant to this appeal: (1) ruled that Bank of America, in addition to LINA, was a Plan Administrator; and (2) concluded that LINA\u2019s denial of benefits was arbitrary and capricious; and (3) remanded the matter to LINA with instructions to consider additional evidence regarding Judith\u2019s eligibility. See <em>Thomas v. Cigna Grp. </em>Ins., No. 1:09-cv-05029, Doc. No. 98, at 28, 43 (E.D.N.Y. Jan. 10, 2013).</p>\n<p id=\"b68-11\">Bank of America appeals the district court\u2019s ruling that it was a Plan Administrator. It notes that the Plan defines the term \u201cPlan Administrator\u201d to mean Countrywide <em>\u201cor such ... entity ... that may be appointed by [Countrywide] ... to administer the Plan,\u201d </em>and that very next sentence of the definition \u2014 ignored by the district court in its analysis of the issue\u2014 states that Countrywide \u201chas appointed the Administrative Committee for Employee Benefit Plans to administer the Plan.\u201d App. at 80 (emphasis added). The Committee in turn delegated to LINA its authority to administer the Plan upon purchasing the Policies. Bank of America directs the Court to <em>Crocco v. Xerox Corp., </em>which held that \u201cif a plan specifically designates a plan administrator, then that individual or entity is <em>the </em>plan administrator for purposes of ERISA.\u201d 137 F.3d 105, 107 (2d Cir.1998) (emphasis in original). Lastly, Bank of America expresses concern that, were proceedings to continue under a new action, the Order would be \u201ceffectively unreviewable\u201d on a later appeal. Appellant\u2019s Br. at 15, n. 8.</p>\n<p id=\"b68-12\">When Bank of America filed its appeal, this Court had yet to determine whether, or under what circumstances, a district court\u2019s remand to an ERISA plan administrator is immediately appealable. We have subsequently addressed this issue in <em>Mead v. Reliastar Life Ins. Co., </em>No. 11-192-cv, 2014 WL 4548868 (2d Cir. Sept. 16, 2014). While declining to adopt \u201ca hard- and-fast rule,\u201d <em>Mead </em>held that \u201cbecause an ERISA remand order contemplates further proceedings before the plan administrator, it is not \u2018final\u2019 and therefore may not be immediately appealed except when the familiar collateral order doctrine ap<page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"41\">*41</page-number>plies.\u201d <em>Id. </em>at *3, 5. <em>Mead </em>further held that \u201cto preserve an ERISA plan administrator\u2019s ability to obtain appellate review of a nonfinal remand order, we generally will interpret a district court\u2019s remand order as having retained jurisdiction over the case such that, after a determination by the plan administrator on remand, either party may seek to reopen the district court proceeding and obtain a final judgment.\u201d <em>Id. </em>at *5.</p>\n<p id=\"b69-5\">Under this framework, the district court\u2019s Order is not an immediately appealable final order. As in <em>Mead, </em>the Order remanded to the Plan Administrator for further factfinding and a new eligibility determination and therefore did not \u201cresolve conclusively the issues of liability and damages.\u201d <em>Id. </em>at *8. Moreover, there is no question that the district court has retained jurisdiction over this case, as it has since received under the same docket number competing motions for summary judgment based on LINA\u2019s denial of benefits on remand. <em>See Thomas v. Cigna Grp. Ins., </em>No. 1:09-cv05029, Doc. Nos. 130, 136.</p>\n<p id=\"b69-6\">Bank of America contends, however, that the portion of the order holding that it is a Plan Administrator is reviewable under the collateral order doctrine. An order is appealable under the collateral order doctrine \u201cif it (1) conclusively determines the disputed question; (2) resolves an important issue completely separate from the merits of the action; and (3) is effectively unreviewable on appeal from a final judgment.\u201d <em>Mohawk Indus., Inc. v. Carpenter, </em>558 U.S. 100, 105, 130 S.Ct. 599, 175 L.Ed.2d 458 (2009) (internal quotation marks omitted). Bank of America\u2019s appeal fails to satisfy at least the third requirement, because the district court\u2019s ruling will unquestionably be reviewable on appeal from a final judgment. As the district court\u2019s remand was not a final order and proceedings have continued under the same docket number, there is no longer any concern that the Order might be treated as a final judgment barring Bank of America from appealing any subsequent order by res judicata without an opportunity for appeal. Review of nonfinal orders under the collateral order doctrine is intended to be \u201cnarrow and selective,\u201d <em>id. </em>at 113, 130 S.Ct. 599 (internal quotation marks omitted), and there is no compelling reason to grant such review here.</p>\n<p id=\"b69-8\">Because the Order was not an immediately appealable final order and review under the collateral order doctrine is inappropriate, we DISMISS this appeal for lack of jurisdiction.</p>\n</opinion>\n</casebody>\n",
