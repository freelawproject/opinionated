We have jurisdiction under 28 U.S.C. \u00a7 1291, and we affirm.</p>\n<p id=\"b666-24\">Hanks contends that the district court procedurally erred by imposing the maximum term of imprisonment to punish him for his underlying crime and his multiple violations of supervised release.' He also argues that the court failed to consider the mitigating circumstance of his hip condition, and did not adequately explain the above-Guideline sentence. We review for plain error, <em>see United States v. Valencia-Barragan, </em>608 F.3d 1103, 1108 (9th Cir. 2010), and find none. The record reflects that the district court was aware of the Guidelines range and Hank\u2019s mitigating arguments, and did not impose sentence to punish Hanks, but rather on the basis of Hank\u2019s repeated breaches of the court\u2019s trust. <em>See United States v. Simtob, </em>485 F.3d 1058, 1062-63 (9th Cir.2007) (at a revocation sentencing, the court may sanction the violator for his breach of the <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"639\">*639</page-number>court\u2019s trust). Furthermore, the court adequately explained the sentence. <em>See United States v. Carty, </em>520 F.3d 984, 992 (9th Cir.2008) (en banc).</p>\n<p id=\"b667-5\">AFFIRMED.</p>\n<footnote label=\"***\">\n<p id=\"b666-25\"> This disposition is not appropriate for publication and is not precedent except as provided by 9th Cir.
