R.App. P. 34(a)(2).</p>\n</footnote>\n<opinion data-order=\"9\" data-type=\"opinion\" id=\"x999-2\" type=\"majority\">\n<p id=\"b644-16\">MEMORANDUM <footnotemark>**</footnotemark></p>\n<p id=\"b644-17\">Andres Pulido-Pulido, a native and citizen of Mexico, petitions for review of the Board of Immigration Appeals\u2019 order dismissing his appeal from an immigration judge\u2019s decision denying his motion to reopen deportation proceedings. Our jurisdiction is governed by 8 U.S.C. \u00a7 1252. We review for abuse of discretion the denial of a motion to reopen. <em>Avagyan v. Holder, </em>646 F.3d 672, 674 (9th Cir.2011). We deny in part and dismiss in part the petition for review.</p>\n<p id=\"b644-22\">The agency did not abuse its discretion by denying as untimely Pulido-Pulido\u2019s motion to reopen based on his claim of ineffective assistance of counsel. Pulido-Pulido filed the motion more than 21 years after his deportation order became administratively final. <em>See </em>8 U.S.C. \u00a7 1229a(e)(7)(C)(i); 8 C.F.R. \u00a7 1003.23(b)(1). Pulido-Pulido also did not establish that his motion qualified for equitable tolling of the filing deadline, where his former attorney\u2019s representation during his 2007-2008 removal proceedings did not prevent him from timely filing his motion to reopen his separate 1989 deportation proceedings in which he appeared pro se. <em>See Avagyan, </em>646 F.3d at 679 (\u201c[A] petitioner is entitled to equitable tolling of the deadline \u2018during periods when a petitioner is prevented from filing because of a deception, fraud, or error.\u2019 \u201d (citation omitted)); <em>Mendez-Alcaraz v. Gonzales, </em>464 F.3d 842, 845 (9th Cir.2006) (\u201cTolling requires that \u2018[the movant\u2019s] ignorance of the limitations period was caused by circumstances beyond the party\u2019s control ....\u2019\u201d (citation omitted)).</p>\n<p id=\"b644-24\">In light of this disposition, we need not consider Pulido-Pulido\u2019s compliance with the procedural requirements for filing a claim of ineffective assistance of counsel or his eligibility for registry. <em>See Simeonov v. Ashcroft, </em>371 F.3d 532, 538 (9th Cir. 2004) (\u201cAs a general rule courts ... are not required to make findings on issues the decision of which is unnecessary to the results they reach.\u201d).</p>\n<p id=\"b644-25\">We lack jurisdiction to review the agency\u2019s refusal to exercise its <em>sua sponte </em>au<page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"617\">*617</page-number>thority to reopen Pulido-Pulido\u2019s case. <em>See Minasyan v. Mukasey, </em>553 F.3d 1224, 1229 (9th Cir.2009).</p>\n<p id=\"b645-5\">PETITION FOR REVIEW DENIED in part; DISMISSED in part.</p>\n<footnote label=\"**\">\n<p id=\"b644-26\"> This disposition is not appropriate for publication and is not precedent except as provided by 9th Cir.
