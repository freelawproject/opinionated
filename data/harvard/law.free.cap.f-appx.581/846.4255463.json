Cassidy appeals the Merit Systems Protection Board\u2019s (MSPB) denial of his request for corrective action under the Whistleblower Protection Act (WPA). Because we find that substantial evidence supports the MSPB\u2019s determination that the Department of Justice (DOJ) demonstrated by clear and convincing evidence Mr. Cassidy would not have been selected to serve as an immigration judge even if he had made no disclosures protected under the WPA, we affirm.</p>\n<p id=\"b875-8\">I. Background</p>\n<p id=\"b875-9\">A. San Antonio application</p>\n<p id=\"b875-10\">At all times relevant to this appeal, Mr. Cassidy served as deputy chief counsel for the Immigration and Customs Enforcement Service (ICE), part of the Department of Homeland Security. In that capacity, Mr. Cassidy assisted in developing and coordinating ICE\u2019s litigation positions before the Immigration Court in Houston, Texas, an administrative tribunal operating within the Executive Office for Immigration Review (EOIR), which is part of DOJ.</p>\n<p id=\"b875-11\">In May and December 2009, respectively, Mr. Cassidy submitted applications in response to EOIR vacancy announcements for immigration judge positions in San Antonio, Texas and in Houston, Texas. Each vacancy announcement required applicants to describe their qualifications, including how they \u201cdemonstrate[d] the appropriate temperament to serve as a judge.\u201d Supplemental Appendix (\u201cS.A.\u201d) 36, 42.</p>\n<p id=\"b875-12\">Judge Larry Dean, an Assistant Chief Immigration Judge based in San Antonio, was responsible for checking the references of some of the candidates for the San Antonio position, including the references listed in Mr. Cassidy\u2019s application. As part of this process, sometimes called \u201cvouchering,\u201d he interviewed the individuals listed as references by Mr. Cassidy as well as several individuals who were not listed as references but knew Mr. Cassidy on a professional basis. He summarized these interviews in several \u201cvouchering sheets.\u201d</p>\n<p id=\"b875-13\">Among those interviewed by Judge Dean included Dina Sherman, the administrator for the immigration court in Houston. Ms. Sherman described Mr. Cassidy as \u201cinformative and well-informed,\u201d though his emails were sometimes \u201cdefensive.\u201d S.A. 64. She stated that he was \u201cpassionate about certain issues,\u201d and, \u201c[i]f a legal issue arises, ... inflexible.\u201d <em>Id. </em>He was, in her opinion, \u201ca person who either likes you or does not.\u201d <em>Id.</em></p>\n<p id=\"b875-14\">Phillip Law, a Houston-based immigration judge, considered Mr. Cassidy to be \u201cvery competent,\u201d but expressed uncertainty about his impartiality. Judge Law commented: \u201cwould [Mr. Cassidy] be impartial? I don\u2019t know. He is very enforcement[-]oriented. He would probably be impartial.\u201d S.A. 64. Judge Law also noted that Mr. Cassidy was sometimes \u201cnot tactful\u201d and that \u201csome trial attorneys indicate that he can \u2018get rough at times.\u2019 \u201d <em>Id.</em></p>\n<p id=\"b875-15\">Judge Dean also interviewed Howard Rose, another Houston-based immigration judge. Judge Rose stated that he had known Mr. Cassidy for 15-20 years, and that Mr. Cassidy \u201cis not a good people person, nor does he have a good temperament.\u201d S.A. 64. Judge Rose said that Mr. Cassidy \u201c[wa]s not easy to get along with,\u201d and that \u201c \u2018lots of good people\u2019 ha[d] <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"848\">*848</page-number>left the [Chief Counsel\u2019s] office because of [him].\u201d <em>Id. </em>Judge Rose felt Mr. Cassidy \u201c \u2018lords\u2019 over people\u201d and that \u201che would be a \u2018screamer\u2019 in court.\u201d <em>Id.</em></p>\n<p id=\"b876-4\">Judge Dean prepared \u201cvouchering sheets\u201d incorporating these responses for the chief immigration judge, Brian O\u2019Leary, and the acting EOIR director, Thomas Snow. Judge O\u2019Leary and Mr. Snow both prepared a ranking of the top candidates for the San Antonio immigration judge position. They each initially ranked Mr. Cassidy as the top candidate. S.A. 65-66. In January 2010, however, Mr. Snow expressed concern \u201cabout leaving Cassidy as my number one ranked candidate,\u201d especially since there was another candidate, An\u00edbal Martinez, who was \u201chighly qualified\u201d and had \u201creceived outstanding references.\u201d S.A. 66. Though Mr. Snow did not believe Mr. Cassidy should be \u201cdisqualif[ied]\u201d from the application process, the \u201ctemperament[-]related comments he received from some of the people checked with\u201d were \u201ctroub[ling].\u201d <em>Id. </em>After conferring with Judge O\u2019Leary, they determined that Mr. Cassidy should be ranked second, and Mr. Martinez, with strong credentials and no apparent temperament-related concerns, ranked first. They forwarded this ranked list of candidates to a panel of three DOJ officials who made the ultimate selection decision, choosing Mr. Martinez to fill the vacancy. Mr. Cassidy was notified in May 2010 that he had not been selected for the San Antonio immigration judge position.</p>\n<p id=\"b876-5\">B. Houston application</p>\n<p id=\"b876-6\">In December 2009, Mr. Cassidy also submitted an application for an immigration judge position in Houston. Mr. Cassidy\u2019s application for the Houston position was evaluated by Judge O\u2019Leary and Mr. Snow <em>after </em>they had finished reviewing his application for the San Antonio position. S.A. 179. For the Houston position, Judge O\u2019Leary and Mr. Snow ranked Mr. Cassidy as the top candidate among the received applications. According to Mr. Snow, since candidates were \u201cranked vis[-]a[-]vis the other candidates that had applied for that city or that vacancy,\u201d despite any previous concerns about Mr. Cassidy\u2019s \u201ctemperament,\u201d Mr. Snow believed that Mr. Cassidy was \u201cthe best candidate for the Houston vacancy at the time I forwarded the [ ] recommendation [to the DOJ selection panel].\u201d S.A. 180.</p>\n<p id=\"b876-8\">As with the previous ranking for the San Antonio position, Judge O\u2019Leary and Mr. Snow\u2019s ranked list of candidates was submitted to a three-person panel of DOJ officials. The DOJ panel \u2014 consisting of Mr. Snow himself and two deputy assistant attorney generals, Mike Allen and Ann Ravel \u2014 invited Mr. Cassidy for an interview in May 2010. Mr. Snow characterized Mr. Cassidy\u2019s performance in the interview as \u201cOK, but not great. Mike [Allen] &amp; Ann [Ravel] didn\u2019t think he was very strong. [Mr. Cassidy] didn\u2019t always answer the question asked ... [and was t]oo facile in responses.\u201d S.A. 79.</p>\n<p id=\"b876-9\">As a result, the panel invited the second-ranked candidate for an interview. This candidate also failed to impress the panelists. The panel then invited the third-ranked candidate, Saul Greenstein, whom they determined to be \u201cvery poised, reflective, articulate, [with an] excellent low-key demeanor.\u201d S.A. 177. Mr. Greenstein was ultimately selected to fill the vacant immigration judge position in Houston. Mr. Cassidy was informed in June 2010 that he had not been selected for the position.</p>\n<p id=\"b876-10\">C. Mr. Cassidy\u2019s complaint</p>\n<p id=\"b876-11\">According to Mr. Cassidy, he initially filed a complaint with the Equal Employment Opportunity Commission when he <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"849\">*849</page-number>found out that Mr. Martinez was selected for the San Antonio immigration judge position.<footnotemark>1</footnotemark> After he was not selected for the Houston immigration judge position, Mr. Cassidy submitted a complaint to the Office of Special Counsel, alleging that his failure to be selected for the San Antonio and Houston immigration judge positions constituted retaliation against him for making disclosures protected by the WPA.</p>\n<p id=\"b877-5\">The crux of Mr. Cassidy\u2019s complaint was based on an e-mail exchange in October 2009 between his supervisor, Gary Goldman, and Judge Dean (\u201cthe October 2009 e-mail chain\u201d). Mr. Goldman, Mr. Cassidy\u2019s supervisor and ICE\u2019s chief counsel, sent an e-mail to Judge Dean stating that the immigration court' in Polk County, Texas, took on average \u201cgreater than three weeks to schedule an alien for an initial master calendar appearance after receipt of the filing of the [notice to appear].\u201d S.A. 50. This delay, according to Mr. Goldman\u2019s recollection, violated a settlement agreement that required DOJ to provide an initial hearing to detained immigrants within 48 hours of the government giving the court notice of the detention. Shortly thereafter, Mr. Cassidy, who had been copied on the e-mail, replied to all the message\u2019s recipients, stating \u201cI have always found this to be an important issue____ Clearly, indeterminate detention was a concern of our Founding Fathers .... [T]he detainees probably have the same fears of indeterminate detention. I hope we can address this issue.\u201d <em>Id.</em></p>\n<p id=\"b877-7\">Judge Rose\u2019s name did not appear anywhere in the October 2009 e-mail chain. Nevertheless, Mr. Cassidy alleged that this e-mail was a \u201ccomplain[t]\u201d about Judge Rose to Judge Dean. S.A. 86. Further, even though it was Mr. Goldman\u2014 and not Mr. Cassidy \u2014 who wrote to Judge Dean about the allegedly long wait times for detained immigrants, Mr. Cassidy\u2019s complaint implied that he \u2014 and not Mr. Goldman \u2014 had written the initial e-mail to Judge Dean in the October 2009 e-mail chain. <em>See id.</em></p>\n<p id=\"b877-10\">The Office of Special Counsel closed its file on Mr. Cassidy\u2019s complaint in February 2011 after concluding that his WPA claim lacked merit. Mr. Cassidy then filed a WPA claim with the MSPB, contending that his complaints to Judge Dean about Judge Rose constituted protected disclosures, and that Judge Dean had punished him for making these disclosures by ensuring that Mr. Cassidy would not be selected for a position as an immigration judge. An administrative judge at the MSPB dismissed Mr. Cassidy\u2019s WPA claim for lack of jurisdiction.</p>\n<p id=\"b877-11\">On appeal, the MSPB vacated the administrative judge\u2019s dismissal for lack of jurisdiction. The MSPB concluded that if Mr. Cassidy had \u201ccomplained to Judge Dean that Judge Rose\u2019s conduct and unnecessary delays violated the due process rights of detained aliens,\u201d such a complaint was a nonfrivolous allegation that could serve as the basis of a reasonable belief by Mr. Cassidy that \u201che was disclosing a violation of law, rule, or regulation in his communications with Judge Dean.\u201d <em>Cassidy v. Dep\u2019t of Justice, </em>118 M.S.P.R. 74, 78 (M.S.P.B.2012). The MSPB ruled that this was a question of fact that should be resolved by the administrative judge on remand. <em>Id.</em></p>\n<p id=\"b877-12\">The MSPB also determined that Mr. Cassidy had made nonfrivolous allegations that, if substantiated, could satisfy the \u201cknowledge/timing\u201d test for determining <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"850\">*850</page-number>whether allegedly protected disclosures were a contributing factor to his non-selection. <em>Id. </em>at *79-83. In particular, the MSPB determined that Mr. Cassidy\u2019s allegations could support a finding that Judge Dean, motivated by retaliatory animus, influenced DOJ officials on the selection panels and thus, that the decision-making DOJ officials had constructive knowledge of Mr. Cassidy\u2019s allegedly protected disclosures. <em>Id. </em>Furthermore, the MSPB determined that Mr. Cassidy\u2019s allegedly whistle-blowing e-mail was sent within a period of time such that a reasonable person could conclude that it was a contributing factor to his non-selection for either the San Antonio or the Houston immigration judge positions. <em>Id. </em>Consequently, the MSPB had jurisdiction over Mr. Cassidy\u2019s complaint, and the administrative judge was required to adjudicate the merits of Mr. Cassidy\u2019s claim on remand.</p>\n<p id=\"b878-4\">On remand, the administrative judge heard testimony from several witnesses, including Mr. Cassidy, Judge Dean, Judge Rose, Judge O\u2019Leary, and Mr. Snow. After reviewing their testimony and other evidence in the record, the administrative judge denied Mr. Cassidy\u2019s request for corrective action. <em>Cassidy v. Dep\u2019t of Justice, </em>DA-1221-11-0365-B-1, at *2 (M.S.P.B. Sept. 27, 2012) (hereinafter, \u201cInitial Decision\u201d). The administrative judge determined that DOJ had proven by clear and convincing evidence that it would not have selected Mr. Cassidy for a position as an immigration.judge in either San Antonio or Houston even if he had not made any protected disclosures under the WPA.</p>\n<p id=\"b878-5\">Mr. Cassidy then petitioned the MSPB for review of the administrative judge\u2019s decision. The MSPB rejected his petition and adopted the administrative judge\u2019s decision, concluding that Mr. Cassidy\u2019s arguments constituted \u201cmere disagreement with the administrative judge\u2019s explained findings of fact and credibility determinations,\u201d which were \u201csupported by the record and entitled to deference.\u201d <em>Cassidy v. Dep\u2019t of Justice, </em>DA-1221-11-0365-B-1, . 120 M.S.P.R. 52, 2013 WL 4710462, at *7 (M.S.P.B. Aug. 30, 2013) (hereinafter, <em>\u201cFinal Order\u201d). </em>This appeal followed.</p>\n<p id=\"b878-7\">II. Discussion</p>\n<p id=\"b878-8\">Our review of MSPB decisions is narrowly defined and limited by statute. 5 U.S.C. \u00a7 7703(c). We must affirm a decision by the MSPB unless it is found to be unsupported by substantial evidence. <em>Id.; see also Kahn v. Dep\u2019t of Justice, </em>618 F.3d 1306, 1312 (Fed.Cir.2010). Substantial evidence is \u201csuch relevant evidence as a reasonable mind might accept as adequate to support a conclusion.\u201d <em>McLaughlin v. Office of Pers. Mgmt., </em>353 F.3d 1363, 1369 (Fed.Cir.2004) (citation and internal quotation marks omitted).</p>\n<p id=\"b878-9\">The WPA prohibits agencies from taking an adverse personnel action against an employee in retaliation for certain types of protected disclosures. The relevant WPA statute, 5 U.S.C. \u00a7 2302(b)(8)(A), is excerpted below:</p>\n<blockquote id=\"b878-10\">(b) Any employee who has authority to take, direct others to take, recommend, or approve any personnel action, shall not, with respect to such authority\u2014</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b878-11\">(8) take or fail to take, or threaten to take or fail to take, a personnel action with respect to any employee or applicant for employment because of\u2014</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b878-12\">(A) any disclosure of information by an employee or applicant which the employee or applicant reasonably believes evidences\u2014</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b878-13\">(i) any violation of any law, rule, or regulation, or</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b878-14\">(ii) gross mismanagement, a gross waste of funds, an abuse of authori<page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"851\">*851</page-number>ty, or a substantial and specific danger to public health or safety____</blockquote>\n<p id=\"b879-5\">If an adverse personnel action has been taken against an employee based on conduct protected under statutes such as the WPA, the MSPB will order corrective action if that protected activity was a \u201ccontributing factor\u201d to the adverse personnel action. Per the governing statute, 5 U.S.C. \u00a7 1221(e)(1):</p>\n<blockquote id=\"b879-6\">Subject to the provisions of paragraph (2), in any case involving an alleged prohibited personnel practice as described under section 2302(b)(8) ..., the Board shall order such corrective action as the Board considers appropriate if the employee, former employee, or applicant for employment has demonstrated that a disclosure or protected activity described under section 2302(b)(8) ... was a contributing factor in the personnel action which was taken or is to be taken against such employee, former employee, or applicant.</blockquote>\n<p id=\"b879-7\">Thus, employees must show that a protected disclosure was a \u201ccontributing factor\u201d to an adverse employment decision by a preponderance of the evidence. <em>Kewley v. Dep\u2019t of Health &amp; Human Servs., </em>153 F.3d 1357, 1361 (Fed.Cir.1998). One way for an aggrieved employee or applicant to make this showing is by providing evidence sufficient to meet the \u201cknowledge/timing\u201d test. This test is also codified in 5 U.S.C. \u00a7 1221(e)(1):</p>\n<blockquote id=\"b879-8\">The employee may demonstrate that the disclosure or protected activity was a contributing factor in the personnel action through circumstantial evidence, such as evidence that\u2014</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b879-9\">(A) the official taking the personnel action knew of the disclosure or protected activity; and</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b879-10\">(B) the personnel action occurred within a period of time such that a reasonable person could conclude that the disclosure or protected activity was a contributing factor in the personnel action.</blockquote>\n<p id=\"b879-12\">By statute, once an employee satisfies the \u201cknowledge/timing\u201d test, the agency may rebut the employee\u2019s claim by showing by clear and convincing evidence \u201cthat it would have taken the same personnel action even in the absence of [the protected] disclosure.\u201d 5 U.S.C. \u00a7 1221(e)(2); <em>see also Chambers v. Dep\u2019t of Interior, </em>602 F.3d 1370, 1375-76 (Fed.Cir.2010).</p>\n<p id=\"b879-13\">Three non-exclusive factors, known as the <em>Carr </em>factors, are relevant in assessing whether an agency has shown by clear and convincing evidence that it would have taken the same personnel action even in the absence of any alleged whistle-blowing: 1) \u201cthe strength of the agency\u2019s evidence in support of its personnel action\u201d; 2) \u201cthe existence and strength of any motive to retaliate on the part of the agency officials who were involved in the decision\u201d; and 3) \u201cany evidence that the agency takes similar actions against employees who are not whistle-blowers but who are otherwise similarly situated.\u201d <em>Carr v. Soc. Sec. Admin., </em>185 F.3d 1318, 1323 (Fed.Cir.1999). The agency is not required to present evidence concerning all three of those factors; rather, \u201c[t]he factors are merely appropriate and pertinent considerations for determining whether the agency carries its burden.\u201d <em>Whitmore v. Dep\u2019t of Labor, </em>680 F.3d 1353, 1374 (Fed.Cir.2012).</p>\n<p id=\"b879-14\">A. San Antonio non-selection</p>\n<p id=\"b879-15\">Pursuant to 5 U.S.C. \u00a7 1221(e)(1), the MSPB found that Mr. Cassidy satisfied the \u201cknowledge/timing\u201d test by showing that Judge Dean was aware of Mr. Cassidy\u2019s email in the October 2009 e-mail chain and that his May 2010 non-selection for the San Antonio position was within such time that a reasonable person could find <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"852\">*852</page-number>that the disclosure contributed to the action. Initial Decision<footnotemark>2</footnotemark> at 8. The MSPB determined, however, that pursuant to 5 U.S.C. \u00a7 1221(e)(2), DOJ successfully rebutted any presumption that a WPA violation occurred by providing clear and convincing evidence that Mr. Cassidy would not have been selected for the San Antonio immigration judge position even if he had not made any protected disclosures. Substantial evidence supports the MSPB\u2019s findings.</p>\n<p id=\"b880-4\">The MSPB focused on the first two nonexclusive <em>Carr </em>factors: the strength of DOJ\u2019s evidence supporting its personnel action, and the existence of any motive to retaliate by the officials involved in the non-selection decision. The MSPB discounted the third <em>Carr </em>factor as less relevant, as the contested action was non-selection rather than punishment, and none of the other candidates for the position were alleged to have made protected disclosures.</p>\n<p id=\"b880-5\">As for the first <em>Carr </em>factor, the MSPB noted that Judge O\u2019Leary and Mr. Snow had raised concerns about Mr. Cassidy\u2019s temperament, which they testified was \u201ca very important quality for an [immigration] judge\u201d and was expressly listed as a \u201cQuality Ranking Factor\u201d for the evaluation of candidates in the description of the position. Initial Decision at 12. For example, the MSPB noted that Ms. Sherman described Mr. Cassidy as \u201cinflexible\u201d on legal issues and is someone \u201cwho either likes you or does not.\u201d <em>Id. </em>at 11. Mr. Cassidy\u2019s only response to Ms. Sherman\u2019s comments is that she had no right to make those comments because she is not a lawyer. <em>Id. </em>at 9. The MSPB also noted that Judge Law felt Mr. Cassidy could \u201cget rough at times\u201d and was not always \u201ctactful.\u201d <em>Id. </em>Indeed, Mr. Cassidy admitted during his testimony that he is \u201cless than tactful\u201d on occasion and has been disrespectful to his supervisor, Mr. Goldman. <em>Id. </em>at 10. Finally, the MSPB noted that Judge Rose, who had known Mr. Cassidy for 15-20 years, believed Mr. Cassidy did not have a good temperament and would be a \u201cscreamer\u201d in court. <em>Id. </em>at 11. Judge Rose believed Mr. Cassidy \u201clords\u201d over people and \u201clots of good people\u201d had left the Chief Counsel\u2019s office because of him. Initial Decision at 11.</p>\n<p id=\"b880-8\">In contrast, the MSPB found that Mr. Martinez was described as \u201cvery even handed\u201d and having an \u201ceven, professional demeanor.\u201d <em>Id. </em>at 29. Judge O\u2019Leary and Mr. Snow both testified that they moved Mr. Cassidy from the first to the second-ranked candidate for the San Antonio position solely due to concerns that his temperament was not suited to the role of an immigration judge, and the MSPB determined their testimony to be credible. <em>Id. </em>at 12-13. We agree. Mr. Cassidy provides no genuine basis to contest the MSPB\u2019s findings under this factor. In fact, Mr. Cassidy admitted during his testimony that if he had the comments of Ms. Sherman, Judge Law, and Judge Rose before him and he was on the panel, he would not have selected himself for the San Antonio immigration judge position. <em>Id. </em>at 10.</p>\n<p id=\"b880-9\">Rather, Mr. Cassidy\u2019s primary challenge to the MSPB decision appears to be more directed to the second <em>Carr </em>factor: motive to retaliate. In particular, Mr. Cassidy contends that the MSPB should not have relied on Judge Dean\u2019s notes or Judge Rose\u2019s testimony concerning his temperament since they were \u201ctainted\u201d by Judge <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"853\">*853</page-number>Dean\u2019s allegedly retaliatory motive. Appellant\u2019s Br. 22. The evidence relied on by the MSPB, however, supports the opposite conclusion: neither Judge Rose nor Judge Dean had any motive to retaliate against Mr. Cassidy based on Mr. Cassidy\u2019s e-mail in the October 2009 e-mail chain.</p>\n<p id=\"b881-5\">The MSPB concluded that \u201c[t]here is no evidence in the record that shows Judge Law or Judge Rose were aware of [Mr. Cassidy\u2019s] disclosures to Judge Dean.\u201d Initial Decision at 29. Mr. Cassidy relies solely on the October 2009 e-mail chain as evidence that Judge Rose knew of his complaint to Judge Dean that Judge Rose was not \u201cconscientious about his duties\u201d and was \u201cexceptionally slow\u201d in adjudicating the cases before him. S.A. 85.<footnotemark>3</footnotemark> In the October 2009 e-mail chain, however, it was <em>Mr. Goldman </em>\u2014 and not Mr. Cassidy \u2014 who specifically raised these concerns. Further, Mr. Goldman\u2019s comments were directed at the Immigration Court at the Polk County Detention Facility, and not at a particular judge. Judge Rose\u2019s name never appears in the e-mail chain.</p>\n<p id=\"b881-6\">In addition, Judge Dean testified that he frequently received complaints about immigration judges from both private and government attorneys and investigating those complaints was part of the ordinary course of his job duties. <em>Id. </em>at 10 \u2014 11; <em>Final Order </em>at *5. The MSPB observed that Mr. Cassidy\u2019s witness Brett Bradford, an Assistant Field Office Director, testified that he had previously made complaints to Judge Dean similar to those allegedly made by Mr. Cassidy. Initial Decision at 14; <em>Final Order </em>at *6. Mr. Bradford admitted that he did not believe Judge Dean retaliated against him in any way because of <em>his </em>complaints. <em>Id. </em>The MSPB found Judge Dean and Mr. Bradford\u2019s testimony to be credible, and we see no reason to disturb those credibility determinations.</p>\n<p id=\"b881-10\">The MSPB also found that Judge Dean had followed standard procedures in \u201cvouchering\u201d both Mr. Cassidy and Mr. Martinez, the applicant eventually selected to fill the immigration judge position in San Antonio. In particular, internal \u201cvouchering\u201d procedures specified that evaluators should check the references listed by applicants as well as additional references, including judges the applicant may have appeared before and court administrators \u201cwho may be familiar with the professional conduct of the applicant.\u201d Initial Decision at 15; S.A. 58.</p>\n<p id=\"b881-11\">The MSPB rejected Mr. Cassidy\u2019s allegation that Judge Dean had contacted Judge Rose solely to obtain a negative reference. Instead, the MSPB found that Judge Dean had only interviewed Judge Rose after contacting another immigration judge listed as a reference by Mr. Cassidy. Mr. Cassidy\u2019s reference told Judge Dean that Mr. Cassidy had not appeared before him for a number of years, and suggested that Judge Dean talk to Judge Rose. Initial Decision at 11.</p>\n<p id=\"b881-12\">Mr. Cassidy also imputes ill motive to Judge Dean based on Judge Dean\u2019s testimony that he asked Mr. Goldman during the \u201cvouchering\u201d process how long it would take for Mr. Cassidy to get into a fight with Judge Rose if Mr. Cassidy was selected for the San Antonio position. <em>Id. </em>at 12. But the MSPB found that Judge Dean did not inform anyone else of this discussion, and that this exchange did not affect Mr. Cassidy\u2019s \u201cvouchering\u201d sheets or demonstrate that Judge Dean had any motive to retaliate against Mr. Cassidy for Mr. Cassidy\u2019s e-mail in the October 2009 <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"854\">*854</page-number>e-mail chain. <em>Id. </em>Further, Mr. Cassidy has no explanation for Judge Dean\u2019s positive review of Mr. Cassidy\u2019s initial interview for the Houston immigration judge position, where he commented that Mr. Cassidy was \u201c[ajrticulate\u201d and \u201c[ijndicate[d] substantial immigration knowledge and eagerness to get back into court.\u201d <em>Id. </em>at 12; S.A. 74. This interview occurred in March 2010, <em>after </em>Judge Dean\u2019s evaluation of Mr. Cassidy\u2019s candidacy for the San Antonio position. Indeed, Judge Dean\u2019s positive evaluation of Mr. Cassidy for the Houston position included no mention of the negative feedback from Ms. Sherman, Judge Law, or Judge Rose. Initial Decision at 28.</p>\n<p id=\"b882-4\">On review of the record as a whole, the MSPB found that Mr. Cassidy\u2019s accusation that Judge Dean negatively influenced the decision-making process of Judge O\u2019Leary and Mr. Snow was not grounded in fact, but based on Mr. Cassidy\u2019s subjective\u2014 and unsupported \u2014 interpretations of the record. <em>Id. </em>at 16. The MSPB also determined that nothing in the record demonstrated that Judge O\u2019Leary or Mr. Snow \u201cw[ere] aware of any [of Mr. Cassidy\u2019s] protected disclosures or had any motive whatsoever to retaliate against [Mr. Cassidy].\u201d <em>Id. </em>at 15. In large part, Mr. Cassidy merely urges us to reweigh the evidence before the MSPB and to reach a different conclusion as to the meaning of documentary evidence and credibility of witness testimony than did the MSPB. This is not our function. <em>See Bieber v. Dep\u2019t of Army, </em>287 F.3d 1358, 1364 (Fed. Cir.2002) (\u201c[R]e-weigh[ing] conflicting evidence ... is not our function.\u201d). Substantial evidence in the record supports the MSPB\u2019s findings that DOJ met its burden to establish Mr. Cassidy would not have been selected for the San Antonio position even if Mr. Cassidy had not made any protected disclosures.</p>\n<p id=\"b882-5\">B. Houston non-selection</p>\n<p id=\"b882-6\">Substantial evidence also supports the MSPB\u2019s conclusion that DOJ demonstrated by clear and convincing evidence Mr. Cassidy would not have been selected for the Houston immigration judge position even if he had not made any protected disclosures. For example, evidence under all three <em>Carr </em>factors supports a conclusion that no WPA violation occurred.</p>\n<p id=\"b882-7\">As for the first <em>Carr </em>factor, the MSPB noted that Judge Dean interviewed Mr. Cassidy as part of the \u201cvouchering\u201d process for the Houston immigration judge position. Initial Decision at 12. Judge Dean described Mr. Cassidy as \u201carticulate\u201d and as having \u201csubstantial immigration knowledge\u201d and an \u201ceagerness to get back into court.\u201d <em>Id. </em>Based in part on Judge Dean\u2019s positive \u201cvouchering sheets,\u201d Judge O\u2019Leary and Mr. Snow initially ranked Mr. Cassidy as the top candidate for the Houston position. <em>Id. </em>at 13; S.A. 179-80. The MSPB found Mr. Snow\u2019s testimony credible that although the DOJ selection panel for the Houston position interviewed Mr. Cassidy first, it decided to interview the second- and third-ranked candidates because of Mr. Cassidy\u2019s mediocre interview performance. Mr. Cassidy contends that nothing in the record supports DOJ\u2019s \u201cunsubstantiated assertion\u201d that he \u201cinterviewed poorly.\u201d Appellant\u2019s Br. 38. According to Mr. Snow, however, Mr. Cassidy provided \u201cfacile\u201d responses to questions and did not \u201calways answer the questions asked.\u201d Initial Decision at 13; S.A. 79.</p>\n<p id=\"b882-8\">As for the second <em>Carr </em>factor, even Mr. Cassidy concedes that \u201cnone of the final decision makers [for the Houston immigration judge position] had any reason to retaliate.\u201d Appellant\u2019s Br. 24. Those DOJ \u201cdecision makers\u201d simply decided not to select Mr. Cassidy because of his poor <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"855\">*855</page-number>interview. And as discussed <em>supra, </em>Mr. Cassidy\u2019s contention that Judge Dean was trying to \u201csabotage\u201d his candidacy because of the October 2009 e-mail chain is undermined by the favorable \u201cvouchering sheets\u201d for Mr. Cassidy submitted by Judge Dean to Judge O\u2019Leary and Mr. Snow. As for the third <em>Carr </em>factor, the MSPB found that Mr. Snow\u2019s testimony was bolstered by the fact that the DOJ panel also passed over the second-ranked candidate for the same reason as Mr. Cassidy: an unimpressive interview. Initial Decision at 15.</p>\n<p id=\"b883-6\">We have considered Mr. Cassidy\u2019s remaining arguments concerning the San Antonio and Houston immigration judge positions and find them unpersuasive.</p>\n<p id=\"b883-7\">III. Conclusion</p>\n<p id=\"b883-8\">Substantial evidence supports the MSPB\u2019s determination that DOJ, by clear and convincing evidence, demonstrated Mr. Cassidy would not have been selected for either the San Antonio or the Houston immigration judge position even if he had not made any protected disclosures. The MSPB\u2019s decision to deny Mr. Cassidy corrective action is therefore</p>\n<p id=\"b883-9\">AFFIRMED.</p>\n<footnote label=\"1\">\n<p id=\"b877-8\">. Mr. Cassidy no longer alleges an Equal Employment Opportunity violation. Appellant's Br. 6.</p>\n</footnote>\n<footnote label=\"2\">\n<p id=\"b880-6\">. The MSPB adopted the findings in the administrative judge\u2019s Initial Decision pursuant to 5 C.F.R. \u00a7 1201.113(b). Final Order at 2.</p>\n</footnote>\n<footnote label=\"3\">\n<p id=\"b881-7\">. Mr. Cassidy\u2019s complaint also alleged that this delay violated a settlement agreement involving DOJ. Mr. Cassidy, however, was unable to produce this alleged agreement or identify the case which had resulted in the purported settlement. S.A. 90, 94.</p>\n</footnote>\n</opinion>\n</casebody>\n",
