Straight\u2019s counsel has moved to withdraw, and has filed a brief, arguing that Straight\u2019s sentence is unreasonable.</p>\n<p id=\"b633-24\">Upon careful review, we conclude that the district court did not impose an unreasonable sentence, particularly in light of Straight\u2019s repeated violations of his supervised-release conditions and the court\u2019s extensive statement of reasons to support its sentencing decision. <em>See United States v. Thunder, </em>553 F.3d 605, 608-09 (8th Cir. 2009) (revocation sentence above advisory range was not substantively unreasonable where defendant repeatedly violated supervised release); <em>United States v. Larison, </em>432 F.3d 921, 924 (8th Cir.2006) (affirming statutory maximum revocation sentence where district court justified decision by giving supporting reasons); <em>see also United States v. Growden, </em>663 F.3d 982, 984 (8th Cir.2011) (per curiam) (revocation sentence is reviewed for substantive reasonableness under deferential abuse-of-discretion standard).</p>\n<p id=\"b634-3\"><page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"606\">*606</page-number>Accordingly, we affirm the judgment of the district court, and we grant counsel\u2019s motion to withdraw.</p>\n<footnote label=\"1\">\n<p id=\"b633-17\">.
