We have jurisdiction under 28 U.S.C. \u00a7 1291, and we affirm.</p>\n<p id=\"b674-23\">Bernardino contends that the district court procedurally erred by failing to calculate the Guidelines range, address adequately the 18 U.S.C. \u00a7 3553(a) sentencing factors, and explain sufficiently the sentence imposed. We review for plain error, <em>see United States v. Valencias-Barragan, </em>608 F.3d 1103, 1108 (9th Cir.2010), and find none. Bernardino has not shown a reasonable probability that he would have received a different sentence had the court explicitly calculated the Guidelines range. <em>See United States v. Dallman, </em>533 F.3d 755, 762 (9th Cir.2008). The record reflects that the court was aware of the Guidelines range, considered the section <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"647\">*647</page-number>3558(a) sentencing factors, and adequately explained the sentence.</p>\n<p id=\"b675-5\">Bernardino next contends that his sentence is substantively unreasonable because the court overemphasized his criminal history and ignored mitigating factors. The district court did not abuse its discretion in imposing Bernardino\u2019s sentence. <em>See Gall v. United States, </em>552 U.S. 38, 51, 128 S.Ct. 586, 169 L.Ed.2d 445 (2007). The sentence, six months above the advisory Guidelines range, is substantively reasonable in light of the totality of the circumstances and the section 3553(a) sentencing factors. <em>See id.</em></p>\n<p id=\"b675-6\">AFFIRMED.</p>\n<footnote label=\"**\">\n<p id=\"b674-24\"> This disposition is not appropriate for publication and is not precedent except as provided by 9th Cir.
