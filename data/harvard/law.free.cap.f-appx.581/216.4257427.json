On appeal, Brown and Garvin challenge their convictions, arguing that the Government did not meet its burden to prove beyond a reasonable doubt that they had the intent to defraud. We affirm.</p>\n<p id=\"b244-22\">We review de novo the district court\u2019s denial of a motion for judgment of acquittal. <em>United States v. Strayhom, </em>743 F.3d 917, 921 (4th Cir.), <em>cert. denied, </em>\u2014 U.S. -, 134 S.Ct. 2689, 189 L.Ed.2d 229 (2014). In assessing the sufficiency of the evidence, we determine whether there is substantial evidence to support the conviction when viewed in the light most favorable to the Government. <em>Id. </em>\u201cSubstantial evidence is evidence that a reasonable finder of fact could accept as adequate and sufficient to support a conclusion of a defendant\u2019s guilt beyond a reasonable doubt.\u201d <em>United States v. Jaensch, </em>665 F.3d 83, 93 (4th Cir.2011) (internal quotation marks omitted). The test is whether <em>\u201cany </em>rational trier of fact could have found the essential elements beyond a reasonable doubt.\u201d <em>United States v. Madrigal-Valadez, </em>561 F.3d 370, 374 (4th Cir.2009) (internal quotation marks omitted).</p>\n<p id=\"b244-25\">We consider \u201cthe complete picture\u201d created by the evidence, <em>United States v. Burgos, </em>94 F.3d 849, 863 (4th Cir.1996) (en banc), including both circumstantial and direct evidence, and draw all reasonable inferences from such evidence in the Government\u2019s favor. <em>United States v. Harvey, 532 </em>F.3d 326, 333 (4th Cir.2008). If the evidence supports different interpretations, the jury decides which interpretation to believe, and we \u201cmay not overturn a substantially supported verdict merely because [we] find[] the verdict unpalatable or determinen that another, reasonable <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"217\">*217</page-number>verdict would be preferable.\u201d <em>Burgos, </em>94 F.3d at 862. Rather, \u201c[a] defendant bringing a sufficiency challenge must overcome a heavy burden, and reversal for insufficiency must be confined to cases where the prosecution\u2019s failure is clear.\u201d <em>United States v. Engle, </em>676 F.3d 405, 419 (4th Cir.) (internal quotation marks and citations omitted), <em>cert. denied, </em>\u2014 U.S.-, 133 S.Ct. 179, 184 L.Ed.2d 90 (2012).</p>\n<p id=\"b245-6\">To sustain convictions under 18 U.S.C. \u00a7 371 and \u00a7 514(a)(2), the government must prove, among other elements, that the defendant had the intent to defraud when cashing the false or fictitious instrument. <em>See </em>18 U.S.C. \u00a7 514(a) (\u201cWhoever, with the intent to defraud. ... \u201d); <em>Ingram v. United States, </em>360 U.S. 672, 678, 79 S.Ct. 1314, 3 L.Ed.2d 1503 (1959) (\u201cConspiracy to commit a particular substantive offense cannot exist without <em>at least </em>the degree of criminal intent necessary for the substantive offense itself.\u201d (internal quotation marks omitted)). Like other facts, \u201c[f]raudulent intent may be inferred from the totality of the circumstances and need not be proven by direct evidence.\u201d <em>United States v. Ham, </em>998 F.2d 1247, 1254 (4th Cir.1993). Moreover, under the doctrine of willful blindness, knowledge may be inferred where a defendant deliberately avoids enlightenment. <em>United States v. Campbell, </em>977 F.2d 854, 857 (4th Cir.1992).</p>\n<p id=\"b245-7\">Here, although there was no direct evidence that Appellants had the intent to defraud, we conclude that the circumstances surrounding the check-cashing scheme were suspicious enough to alert even the most unsophisticated individual to the fraudulent nature of the scheme. Moreover, the evidence suggests that Appellants took very few actions to ascertain the validity of the checks even when the transpiring events gave them reasons to suspect that the checks were not legitimate. Finally, Brown testified that she was generally wary of requests to cash monetary instruments but cashed the checks nevertheless, having only the bald assertion from someone she barely knew that they were legitimate. Thus, the jury could have concluded that Appellants \u201csubjectively believe[d] that there [was] a high probability that\u201d the checks were not valid and that they took \u201cdeliberate actions to avoid learning\u201d that they were in fact invalid. <em>Global-Tech Appliances, Inc. v. SEB S.A., </em>\u2014 U.S.-, 131 S.Ct. 2060, 2070, 179 L.Ed.2d 1167 (2011).</p>\n<p id=\"b245-11\">Accordingly, we conclude that the Government met its burden to prove beyond a reasonable doubt that Appellants had the intent to defraud, and we affirm the district court\u2019s judgments. We dispense with oral argument because the facts and legal contentions are adequately presented in the materials before this court and argument would not aid the decisional process.</p>\n<p id=\"b245-12\">\n<em>AFFIRMED.</em>\n</p>\n</opinion>\n</casebody>\n",
