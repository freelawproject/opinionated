Maldonado raises five issues on appeal.</p>\n<p id=\"b49-6\">First, Maldonado argues that there was insufficient evidence to support his conspiracy conviction. Whether sufficient evidence existed to support a conviction is reviewed <em>de novo. United States v. Harvey, </em>746 F.3d 87, 89 (2d Cir.2014) (per curiam). However, the defendant \u201cbears a heavy burden\u201d because \u201cwe view the evidence in the light most favorable to the government, drawing all inferences in the government\u2019s favor and deferring to the jury\u2019s assessments of the witnesses\u2019 credibility.\u201d <em>Id. </em>(internal quotation marks omitted). \u201cFollowing this review, we will sustain the jury\u2019s verdict if <em>\u2018any </em>rational trier of fact could have found the essential elements of the crime beyond a reasonable doubt.\u2019 \u201d <em>Id. </em>(quoting <em>Jackson v. Virginia, </em>443 U.S. 307, 319, 99 S.Ct. 2781, 61 L.Ed.2d 560 (1979)).</p>\n<p id=\"b49-7\">\u201cWhen a defendant challenges the sufficiency of the evidence'in a conspiracy case, deference to the jury\u2019s findings is especially important because a conspiracy by its very nature is a secretive operation, and it is a rare case where all aspects of a conspiracy can be laid bare in court with the precision of a surgeon\u2019s scalpel.\u201d <em>United States v. Santos, </em>541 F.3d 63, 70 (2d Cir. 2008) (internal quotation marks and alteration omitted). \u201cThe record must nonetheless permit a rational jury to find: (1) the existence of the conspiracy charged; (2) that the defendant had knowledge of the conspiracy; and (3) that the defendant intentionally joined the conspiracy.\u201d <em>Id. </em>(citations omitted).</p>\n<p id=\"b49-11\">Here, viewing the evidence in the light most favorable to the government, we conclude the evidence was sufficient to support the conviction. Maldonado\u2019s own statements to law enforcement officers show that he was systematically buying 31 grams of cocaine every four days for about four months. He admitted that he was purchasing the cocaine from a Dominican seller and then reselling the drugs. Law enforcement officers found baking soda and 54.8 grams of cocaine in Maldonado\u2019s kitchen refrigerator. Elsewhere in his apartment, officers located other drug trafficking tools, such as scales and glassine bags. The quantity of cocaine involved was such that the jury could reasonably infer that both Maldonado and his supplier knowingly joined in a conspiracy the object of which was to sell to Maldonado\u2019s customers. Given the evidence presented to the jury, the argument that the evidence was insufficient to show that the Dominican seller conspired with Maldonado is not persuasive.</p>\n<p id=\"b49-12\">Second, Maldonado argues that he was entitled to a buyer-seller exception jury instruction because evidence presented at trial could have supported the jury\u2019s finding of a buyer-seller, as opposed to a conspiratorial, relationship. A district court\u2019s decision to refuse a jury instruction that was requested by one of the parties is reviewed <em>de novo. United States v. Desinor, </em>525 F.3d 193, 198 (2d Cir.2008).</p>\n<p id=\"b49-13\">\u201cIt is well-established that a criminal defendant is entitled to a jury instruction <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"22\">*22</page-number>reflecting his or her theory of defense for which there is some foundation in the proof, no matter how tenuous that defense may appear to the trial court.\u201d <em>United States v. Medina, </em>944 F.2d 60, 64 (2d Cir.1991) (internal quotation marks omitted). In <em>Medina^ </em>the Court explained that \u201c[t]he rationale for holding a buyer and a seller not to be conspirators is that in the typical buy-sell scenario, which involves a casual sale of small quantities of drugs, there is no evidence that the parties were aware of, or agreed to participate in, a larger conspiracy.\u201d 944 F.2d at 65. That rationale does not apply in Maldonado\u2019s situation because he was engaged in a systematic pattern of purchasing 31 grams of cocaine for $1,300 from a Dominican supplier, selling it over the course of four days, and then repeating the process. Similar to <em>Medina, </em>where the wholesale quantities of cocaine evinced that the drugs were being purchased for resale, <em>id., </em>the Government here introduced Maldonado\u2019s own admission that he was buying the cocaine for resale. Therefore, the district court did not err in refusing to give the requested instruction.</p>\n<p id=\"b50-4\">Third, Maldonado argues that the district court abandoned its gatekeeper function related to expert testimony by failing to perform an on-the-record analysis of whether Morales was qualified as an expert. \u201cWe review the district court\u2019s decision to admit or exclude expert testimony for an abuse of discretion.\u201d <em>United States v. Cruz, </em>363 F.3d 187, 192 (2d Cir. 2004) (internal quotation marks omitted). \u201cA district court\u2019s determination with respect to the admission of expert testimony is not an abuse of discretion unless it is manifestly erroneous.\u201d <em>Id. </em>(internal quotation marks omitted).</p>\n<p id=\"b50-5\">In this case, it was not manifest error for the district court to fail to conduct a <em>Daubert </em>analysis on the record. Given the routine nature of law enforcement officers testifying as experts to educate the jury about the drug trade, it was not an abuse of discretion to refrain from an on-the-record <em>Daubert </em>analysis, and the district court acted within its discretion when allowing Morales to testify.</p>\n<p id=\"b50-7\">Fourth, Maldonado contends that Morales\u2019s testimony was improper. Morales opined that the cocaine and drug paraphernalia found in Maldonado\u2019s apartment were consistent with drug distribution rather than personal use. The parties agree that this argument is evaluated under plain error review. \u201cTo establish plain error, the defendant must establish (1) error (2) that is plain and (3) affects substantial rights.\u201d <em>United States v. Villafuerte, </em>502 F.3d 204, 209 (2d Cir.2007). The appellant must also show that \u201cthe error affected his substantial rights \u2014 i.e., that it affected the outcome of the district court proceedings.\u201d <em>United States v. Reyes, </em>691 F.3d 453, 457 (2d Cir.2012) (per curiam) (internal quotation marks omitted).</p>\n<p id=\"b50-8\">Admission of Morales\u2019s testimony was not in error. \u201cThis court has repeatedly found that the operations of narcotics dealers are a proper subject for expert testimony.\u201d <em>United States v. Lopez, </em>547 F.3d 364, 373 (2d Cir.2008). \u201cTestimony about the weight, purity, dosages, and prices of cocaine clearly relates to knowledge beyond the ken of the average juror.\u201d <em>United States v. Tapia-Ortiz, </em>23 F.3d 738, 741 (2d Cir.1994).</p>\n<p id=\"b50-9\">Fifth, Maldonado submits that the district court erred when it found that he is a career criminal. We review <em>de novo </em>a district court\u2019s interpretation of the Sentencing Guidelines, and its factual findings are reviewed for clear error. <em>United States v. Mason, </em>692 F.3d 178, 182 (2d Cir.2012). \u201c[Questions that concern the <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"23\">*23</page-number>district court\u2019s authority to make a factual finding about the nature of the conviction are questions of law.\u201d <em>United States v. Beardsley, </em>691 F.3d 252, 257 (2d Cir.2012) (internal quotation marks omitted).</p>\n<p id=\"b51-5\">Here, Maldonado concedes that his New York conviction for criminal sale of a controlled substance in the second degree is a predicate offense, but he argues that the record does not show that he was in custody within 15 years of the commencement of the present offense, as required by the Guidelines. Reading the Presentence Report\u2019s description of this state conviction in concert with a prior federal conviction reveals that Maldonado was released from federal custody, reentered state custody on November 8, 2001, for a parole violation on the criminal sale of a controlled substance offense, and was then released on January 24, 2002. The district court\u2019s factual finding on this point was not clear error because it is plausible in light of the entire record. <em>Anderson v. City of Bessemer City, N.C., </em>470 U.S. 564, 573-74, 105 S.Ct. 1504, 84 L.Ed.2d 518 (1985). With regard to Maldonado\u2019s attempted burglary conviction, the Second Circuit has held that a conviction for attempted burglary in the third degree, N.Y. Pen. L. \u00a7 140.20, is a \u201ccrime of violence\u201d under the sentencing guidelines. <em>United States v. Hurrell, </em>555 F.3d 122, 123-24 (2d Cir.2009) (per curiam). We reject Maldonado\u2019s argument to the contrary, and we do not analyze whether his federal conviction also qualifies as a predicate offense because the two state convictions are sufficient to support his career offender status under Guideline \u00a7 4Bl.l(a).</p>\n<p id=\"b51-6\">For the reasons stated above, the judgment and sentence of the district court are AFFIRMED.</p>\n<footnote label=\"1\">\n<p id=\"b49-8\">.
