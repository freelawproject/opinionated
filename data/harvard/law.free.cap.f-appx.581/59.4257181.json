We assume the parties\u2019 familiarity with the underlying facts, the procedural history, and the issues presented for review.</p>\n<p id=\"b87-19\">Collins was outside counsel for Refco, Inc., from as early as 1997 until revelations of accounting fraud in 2005 forced the corporation into bankruptcy. The government eventually charged Collins with supporting Refco executives\u2019 scheme to conceal large amounts of intercompany debt. The scheme was based on a series of artfully timed loans, euphemistically called \u201cshort-term financings,\u201d which bounced the debt back and forth between a Refco subsidiary and Refco\u2019s parent company immediately before and after audits. The short-term financings kept the growing intercompany debt hidden from auditors, banks, customers, and regulators throughout a 2004 leveraged buyout of Refco and throughout a 2005 initial public offering.</p>\n<p id=\"b87-20\">Collins prepared documents for many of the individual transactions that, in aggregate, effected the short-term financings. However, Collins claimed in his defense that he did not know of the fraud scheme motivating these transactions. The government\u2019s showing that Collins was aware (or consciously avoided awareness) of the fraud included: Collins\u2019 work in drafting a Proceeds Participation Agreement (\u201cPPA\u201d) in 2002, which revealed Refco\u2019s desperate <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"60\">*60</page-number>capital shortage and buried the intercompany debt in a side letter; Collins\u2019 failure to disclose the PPA in the 2004 leveraged buyout, when the terms of the PPA might have raised the buyers\u2019 suspicions; Collins\u2019 ready willingness to opine in 2002 that Refco\u2019s $700 million in intercompany debt was enforceable and collectable; and conversations with another attorney in 2004, negotiating a sale of Refco stock, in which Collins was explicitly confronted about the existence of $1.1 billion of debt.</p>\n<p id=\"b88-4\">In 2013, after a five-week trial, a jury convicted Collins of seven counts related to the fraud. Collins now appeals his conviction, challenging the district court\u2019s exclusion of opinion testimony and the delivery of a jury instruction on conscious avoidance. Neither decision represents prejudicial error.</p>\n<p id=\"b88-5\">1. The district court excluded the opinion testimony of two lawyers. This Court \u201creview[s] a district court\u2019s evidentiary rulings for manifest error.\u201d <em>Raskin v. Wyatt Co., </em>125 F.3d 55, 65-66 (2d Cir.1997). Opinion testimony is inadmissible if it is not \u201chelpful to ... determining a fact in issue.\u201d Fed.R.Evid. 701(b); <em>see id. </em>R. 702(a). An opinion is unhelpful and therefore may not be received in evidence if, for example, the testimony would merely recapitulate aspects of the evidence that the jury can already perceive on its own, <em>see Cameron v. City of New York, </em>598 F.3d 50, 62 (2d Cir.2010); the testimony \u201cwould merely tell the jury what result to reach,\u201d <em>United States v. Rea, </em>958 F.2d 1206, 1215 (2d Cir.1992) (quoting Fed.R.Evid. 704 Advisory Committee Note); or an expert\u2019s testimony would deal with matters within \u201cthe ken of the average juror,\u201d <em>United States v. Castillo, </em>924 F.2d 1227, 1232 (2d Cir.1991).</p>\n<p id=\"b88-6\">Collins\u2019 counsel sought to elicit opinions from one lay witness and one expert regarding the materiality of the PPA during the 2004 leveraged buyout. According to Collins\u2019 proffer, both witnesses would have testified that the PPA would have appeared immaterial to the leveraged buyout in the eyes of a lawyer unaware of Refco\u2019s fraud. The expert, a mergers and acquisitions lawyer, would also have testified generally about the work of transactional lawyers. The district court rejected both proffers on the grounds that the testimony would not be helpful to the jury, that the opinions depicting the PPA as immaterial would be conclusory, that Collins could alternatively establish immateriality through cross-examination of government witnesses, that a \u201cwar of experts\u201d should be avoided, and that the materiality vel non of the PPA was within the competence of a jury unassisted by opinion testimony. As it transpired, fact witnesses proved sufficient for Collins\u2019 counsel to present the defense view of the PPA\u2019s materiality, including testimony that rights under the PPA were \u201cextinguished\u201d before the leveraged buyout closed. The district court\u2019s evidentiary rulings were valid exercises of its discretion.</p>\n<p id=\"b88-8\">2. The district court delivered a conscious avoidance charge over Collins\u2019 objection. When the parties in a trial dispute the element of knowledge, a conscious avoidance charge is appropriate if \u201cthe evidence would permit a rational juror to conclude beyond a reasonable doubt that the defendant was aware of a high probability of the fact in dispute and consciously avoided confirming that fact.\u201d <em>United States v. Cuti, </em>720 F.3d 453, 463 (2d Cir. 2013) (quotation marks omitted). This test is satisfied \u201cwhere[ ] a defendant\u2019s involvement in the criminal offense may have been <em>so overwhelmingly suspicious </em>that the defendant\u2019s failure to question the suspicious circumstances establishes the defendant\u2019s purposeful contrivance to avoid guilty knowledge.\u201d <em>United States v. Svo</em><page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"61\">*61</page-number><em>boda, </em>347 F.3d 471, 480 (2d Cir.2003) (internal quotation marks and alteration omitted); <em>see United States v. Goffer, </em>721 F.3d 113, 127-28 (2d Cir.2013). The evidence supporting that overwhelming suspiciousness is often the same evidence used to demonstrate actual knowledge. <em>See Svoboda, </em>347 F.3d at 480.</p>\n<p id=\"b89-5\">Collins argues on appeal that the government introduced insufficient evidence to support a conscious avoidance charge.<footnotemark>1</footnotemark> This argument is untenable in view of the government\u2019s evidence that Collins provided a 2002 legal opinion regarding $700 million in intercompany debt, at a time when Refeo\u2019s public filings reported only $179 million in intercompany debt. Further undercutting Collins\u2019 argument is the trial evidence that another lawyer told him in 2004 that Refco\u2019s CEO had revealed the existence of a $1.1 billion debt while negotiating the price of an equity sale. This evidence was sufficient to support the district court\u2019s conscious avoidance charge.</p>\n<p id=\"b89-6\">For the foregoing reasons, and finding no merit in Collins\u2019 other arguments, we hereby AFFIRM the judgment of the district court.</p>\n<footnote label=\"1\">\n<p id=\"b89-8\">. Collins further argues that the district court\u2019s instruction misstated the legal standard for conscious avoidance, but he concedes that controlling precedent of this Court supports the district court\u2019s instruction. <em>See Goffer, </em>721 F.3d at 128. Given that precedent, we see no fault in the content of the conscious avoidance instruction.</p>\n</footnote>\n</opinion>\n</casebody>\n",
