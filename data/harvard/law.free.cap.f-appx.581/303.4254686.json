Flores seeks an order (1) prohibiting the UTEP faculty members from retaliating against him; (2) directing the Deputy Assistant Secretary for Enforcement of the Department to impose sanctions against UTEP and the UTEP faculty members; (3) admonishing an investigative attorney with the Department\u2019s Office for Civil Rights (\u201cOCR\u201d) in Dallas, Texas, for her alleged failure to comply with Title VI of the Act; and (4) referring his complaints to the Department of Justice. Flores also seeks review of the OCR\u2019s dismissal of his complaints of discrimination and retaliation. Respondents move to dismiss the petition for review. We deny in part and dismiss in part the petition for review.</p>\n<p id=\"b332-13\">Although Flores\u2019 petition is styled as a petition for review of an agency order, Flores\u2019 requests for relief take the form of a writ of mandamus or a writ of prohibition. Writs of mandamus and prohibition are drastic remedies to be used only in extraordinary circumstances. <em>Kerr v. U.S. Dist. Court, </em>426 U.S. 394, 402, 96 S.Ct. 2119, 48 L.Ed.2d 725 (1976) (writ of mandamus); <em>In re Vargas, </em>723 F.2d 1461, 1468 (10th Cir.1983) (writ of prohibition). Relief under these writs is available only when the party seeking relief shows that his right to relief \u201cis clear and indisputable,\u201d <em>United States v. Moussaoui </em>333 F.3d 509, 517 (4th Cir.2003) (internal quotation marks omitted), and that he has \u201cno other adequate means to attain the relief he desires.\u201d <em>Allied Chem. Corp. v. Daiflon, Inc., </em>449 U.S. 33, 35, 101 S.Ct. 188, 66 L.Ed.2d 193 (1980). The relief Flores seeks is not available by way of mandamus or prohibition. We therefore grant leave to proceed in forma pauperis and deny this portion of the petition for review.</p>\n<p id=\"b332-14\">Flores also seeks review of the OCR\u2019s dismissal of his complaints of retaliation <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"305\">*305</page-number>and discrimination. In the motion to dismiss the petition for review, Respondents argue that we lack jurisdiction to review the OCR\u2019s dismissal decision.</p>\n<p id=\"b333-5\">\u201cFederal courts are courts of limited jurisdiction\u201d possessing \u201conly that power authorized by Constitution and statute.\u201d <em>Robb Evans &amp; Assocs., LLC v. Holibaugh, </em>609 F.3d 359, 362 (4th Cir.2010) (internal quotation .marks omitted). The burden of establishing subject matter jurisdiction in this court is on Flores, the party asserting it. <em>Id. </em>Contrary to Flores\u2019 assertions, the regulations implementing Title VI of the Act on which he relies, 34 C.F.R. Pt. 100 (2013), do not confer jurisdiction on this court to review dismissals by the OCR of complaints of discrimination and retaliation, and jurisdiction cannot be based on the provisions of the Administrative Procedure Act, 5 U.S.C. \u00a7\u00a7 701-06 (2012). Further, insofar as Flores relies on Rule 15 of the Federal Rules of Appellate Procedure as a basis for jurisdiction, the rule does not confer appellate jurisdiction but, rather, addresses the procedures to be utilized in reviewing agency orders where a court of appeals is authorized by statute to review final agency determinations, <em>Dillard v. U.S. Dep\u2019t of Hous. &amp; Urban Dev., </em>548 F.2d 1142, 1143 (4th Cir.1977) (per curiam), an authorization that is lacking in this case. We thus lack jurisdiction to review the OCR\u2019s decision to dismiss Flores\u2019 complaints and grant Respondents\u2019 motion to dismiss this portion of the petition for review.<footnotemark>*</footnotemark></p>\n<p id=\"b333-6\">Accordingly, we deny in part and dismiss in part the petition for review. We dispense with oral argument because the facts and legal contentions are adequately presented in the materials before this court and argument would not aid the decisional process.</p>\n<p id=\"b333-10\">\n<em>PETITION DENIED IN PART AND DISMISSED IN PART.</em>\n</p>\n<footnote label=\"*\">\n<p id=\"b333-7\"> Insofar as Flores also may be seeking review of the OCR's denial of his administrative appeal, we conclude we lack jurisdiction to review that decision for the same reasons we lack jurisdiction to review the OCR\u2019s dismissal decision.</p>\n</footnote>\n</opinion>\n</casebody>\n",
