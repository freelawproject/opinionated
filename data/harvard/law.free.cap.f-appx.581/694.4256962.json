R.App. P. 34(a)(2).</p>\n</footnote>\n<opinion data-order=\"9\" data-type=\"opinion\" id=\"x999-2\" type=\"majority\">\n<p id=\"b723-7\">MEMORANDUM <footnotemark>**</footnotemark></p>\n<p id=\"b723-8\">Clifton T. Hastings appeals pro se the district court\u2019s judgment affirming the Commissioner of Social Security\u2019s denial of Hastings\u2019s third application for disability insurance benefits and supplemental security income under Titles II and XVI of the Social Security Act. We have jurisdiction under 28 U.S.C. \u00a7 1291, and we affirm.</p>\n<p id=\"b723-9\">The district court did not err in holding that it lacked subject matter jurisdiction to decide whether the Commissioner failed to meet an obligation to retain the record of Hastings\u2019s first application for benefits in 2000. The Commissioner\u2019s retention or loss of records is not a \u201cfinal decision\u201d subject to review. <em>See </em>42 U.S.C. \u00a7 405(g); <em>Dexter v. Colvin, </em>731 F.3d 977, 980 (9th Cir .2013).</p>\n<p id=\"b723-10\">The district court also lacked jurisdiction to consider whether the Commissioner set an incorrect onset date when granting Hastings\u2019s subsequent, fourth application for benefits. The court had jurisdiction only to review the Commissioner\u2019s final decision denying Hastings\u2019s third application for benefits. <em>See </em>42 U.S.C. \u00a7 405(g); <em>Dexter, </em>731 F.3d at 980.</p>\n<p id=\"b723-12\">Hastings contends that the administrative law judge erred by failing to order IQ testing because such testing might have established a listed impairment. This contention lacks merit because the record was adequate to allow for proper evaluation of the evidence. <em>See Mayes v. Massanari, </em>276 F.3d 453, 459-60 (9th Cir.2001). The low average intellectual functionality reported by an examining psychologist would not meet or equal the requirements of the listings. <em>See Kennedy v. Colvin, </em>738 F.3d 1172, 1174 (9th Cir.2013).</p>\n<p id=\"b723-13\">Any error in the ALJ\u2019s partial rejection, \u2022without explanation, of the opinion of a non-examining psychologist was harmless because even if the ALJ had accepted the psychologist\u2019s findings, Hastings\u2019s impairments would not have met the listings. <em>See Molina v. Astrue, </em>674 F.3d 1104, 1110 (9th Cir.2012).</p>\n<p id=\"b723-14\">We decline to consider additional issues unsupported by argument in the opening brief. <em>See Indep. Towers of Wash. v. Washington, </em>350 F.3d 925, 929 (9th Cir. 2003).</p>\n<p id=\"b723-15\">AFFIRMED.</p>\n<footnote label=\"**\">\n<p id=\"b723-11\"> This disposition is not appropriate for publication and is not precedent except as provided by 9th Cir.
