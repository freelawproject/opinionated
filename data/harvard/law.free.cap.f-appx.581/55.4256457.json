We assume the parties\u2019 familiarity with the underlying facts, the procedural history, and the issues presented for review.</p>\n<p id=\"b83-23\">We review <em>de novo </em>a district court\u2019s decision to grant judgment on the pleadings. <em>LaFaro v. N.Y. Cardiothoracic Grp., PLLC, </em>570 F.3d 471, 475 (2d Cir.2009).</p>\n<p id=\"b83-24\">Title II of the ADA applies to \u201cthe services, programs, or activities of a public entity.\u201d 42 U.S.C. \u00a7 12132. Section 504 of the Rehabilitation Act of 1973 applies to \u201cany program or activity receiving Federal financial assistance.\u201d 29 U.S.C. \u00a7 794(a). The district court determined that Positano\u2019s suit under ADA Title II and the Re<page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"56\">*56</page-number>habilitation Act<footnotemark>1</footnotemark> had not plausibly alleged that defendants Zimmer and Gade were public actors, that they acted under color of law, or that they received federal funding. Accordingly, the district court concluded that Zimmer and Gade were not amenable to suit under these statutes. On our review of the pleadings, we agree for substantially the same reasons as stated by the district court. On appeal, Positano has shown no error in these conclusions.</p>\n<p id=\"b84-4\">For the foregoing reasons, and finding no merit in Positano\u2019s other arguments, we hereby AFFIRM the judgment of the district court.</p>\n<footnote label=\"1\">\n<p id=\"b84-9\">. Positano's arguments on appeal reference Title V of the ADA; but Positano (a lawyer) cited only Title II in his complaint. <em>Cf. Tracy v. Freshwater, </em>623 F.3d 90, 102 (2d Cir.2010) (noting that the usual solicitude afforded to <em>pro se </em>litigants does not apply to a lawyer representing himself).</p>\n</footnote>\n</opinion>\n</casebody>\n",
