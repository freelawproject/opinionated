SACK, DEBRA ANN LIVINGSTON, RAYMOND J. LOHIER, JR., Circuit Judges.</p>\n<opinion data-order=\"7\" data-type=\"opinion\" id=\"x999-1\" type=\"majority\">\n<p id=\"b82-15\">SUMMARY ORDER</p>\n<p id=\"b82-16\">On September 9, 2018, Defendant-Appellant Ramon Atilano-Ruiz pled guilty to one count of illegally reentering the United States in violation of 8 U.S.C. \u00a7\u00a7 1326(a) and (b)(1). At his January 7, 2014 sentencing hearing, the district court (Suddaby, <em>J.) </em>imposed a twelve-month prison sentence with no period of supervised release to follow. Atilano-Ruiz now challenges the substantive reasonableness of that sentence. We assume the parties\u2019 familiarity with the underlying facts, the procedural history, and the issues for review.</p>\n<p id=\"b82-17\">\u201cArticle III of the Constitution limits the judicial power of the United States to the resolution of cases and controversies.\u201d <em>Cooper v. U.S. Postal Serv., </em>577 F.3d 479, 489 (2d Cir.2009) (citing U.S. Const. art. III, \u00a7 2). \u201cIn order to satisfy the case-or-controversy requirement, a party must, at all stages of the litigation, have an actual injury which is likely to be redressed by a favorable judicial decision.\u201d <em>United States v. Mercurris, </em>192 F.3d 290, 293 (2d Cir. 1999). Thus, \u201cif an event occurs during the course of the proceedings or on appeal that makes it impossible for the court to grant any effectual relief whatever to a prevailing party, we must dismiss the case\u201d as moot. <em>United States v. Blackburn, </em>461 F.3d 259, 261 (2d Cir.2006) (quoting <em>United States v. Quattrone, </em>402 F.3d 304, 308 (2d Cir.2005)) (internal quotation marks omitted).</p>\n<p id=\"b82-18\">We conclude, and Atilano-Ruiz concedes, that Atilano-Ruiz\u2019s appeal is moot because he has been released from prison and is not on supervised release. <em>See, e.g., United States v. Williams, </em>475 F.3d 468, 479 (2d Cir.2007) (ruling that a sentencing appeal was moot because the appellant had <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"55\">*55</page-number>been \u201crelease[d] from prison\u201d and the district court could not \u201cimpose a reduced term of supervised release\u201d). According to records from the Bureau of Prisons and Immigration and Customs Enforcement, Atilano-Ruiz completed his sentence on August 19, 2014 and was removed from the United States on September 2, 2014. A \u201cpost-release sentencing correction cannot alleviate injury that resulted from [an] earlier incarceration,\u201d and Atilano-Ruiz has not established another \u201ccontinuing or imminent concrete injury\u201d to invoke this Court\u2019s jurisdiction. <em>United States v. Ben Zvi, </em>242 F.3d 89, 99 (2d Cir.2001).</p>\n<p id=\"b83-5\">For the foregoing reasons, the appeal is DISMISSED as moot.</p>\n<p id=\"b83-6\">--</p>\n</opinion>\n</casebody>\n",
