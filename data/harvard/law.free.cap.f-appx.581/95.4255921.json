City of New York, </em>Nos. 99 Civ. 3873, 01 Civ. 9406 (S.D.N.Y. Sept. 4, 2013). For the reasons stated in our Summary Order in the related appeal of <em>Bey v. City of New York, </em>No. 13-3733, we REVERSE the district court\u2019s vacatur of the punitive damages, but otherwise AFFIRM the Amended Judgment of the district court.</p>\n<p id=\"b124-18\">Defendants appeal in this action simply to reserve the issue of attorney\u2019s fees pending resolution of the related appeal in <em>Bey v. City of New York, </em>No. 13-3733. Given our resolution of that action, Defendants\u2019 appeal in this case is DISMISSED as moot.</p>\n</opinion>\n</casebody>\n",
