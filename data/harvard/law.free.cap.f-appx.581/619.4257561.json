We have jurisdiction under 28 U.S.C. \u00a7 1291, and we affirm.</p>\n<p id=\"b647-26\">Nambo-Milan contends that the district court erred by relying on improper factors in making its sentencing decision. We review for plain error, <em>see United States v. Hammons, </em>558 F.3d 1100, 1103 (9th Cir. 2009), and find none. The record reflects that the district court properly considered the sentencing factors specified in 18 U.S.C. \u00a7 3583 and did not impose the sentence on the basis of any improper factor. <em>See United States v. Simtob, </em>485 F.3d 1058, 1062-63 (9th Cir.2007); <em>see also </em>U.S.S.G. \u00a7 5D1.1 cmt. n. 5 (court should consider imposing term of supervised release on a deportable alien if the court determines that doing so would provide an added measure of deterrence).</p>\n<p id=\"b648-3\"><page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"620\">*620</page-number>Nambo^Milan also contends that the district court imposed a substantively unreasonable sentence. The district court did not abuse its discretion in imposing Nambo-Milan\u2019s sentence. <em>See Gall v. United States, </em>552 U.S. 38, 51, 128 S.Ct. 586, 169 L.Ed.2d 445 (2007). The sentence, including the supervised release term, is substantively reasonable in light of the section 3583 sentencing factors and the totality of the circumstances, including Nambo-Milan\u2019s breach of trust, his immigration history, and the need to deter. <em>See Simtob, </em>485 F.3d at 1062-63; <em>United States v. Valdavinos-Torres, </em>704 F.3d 679, 692-93 (9th Cir.2012).</p>\n<p id=\"b648-4\">The government\u2019s motion for judicial notice is granted.</p>\n<p id=\"b648-5\">AFFIRMED.</p>\n<footnote label=\"**\">\n<p id=\"b647-27\"> This disposition is not appropriate for publication and is not precedent except as provided by 9 th Cir.
