Feb. 28, 2013). We assume the parties\u2019 familiarity with the underlying facts and procedural history in this case.</p>\n<p id=\"b113-16\">It is undisputed that Chowdhury\u2019s motion to reopen, filed one day beyond the 90-day period for reopening, was untimely. <em>See </em>8 U.S.C. \u00a7 1229a(c)(7)(C)(i); 8 C.F.R. \u00a7 1003.2(c)(2). This period may be tolled if the alien can demonstrate ineffective assistance of counsel. <em>Rashid v. Mukasey, </em>533 F.3d 127, 130 (2d Cir.2008). To benefit from equitable tolling, the alien must demonstrate, among other requirements, prejudice as a result of counsel\u2019s incompetent performance. <em>Id. </em>at 130-31.</p>\n<p id=\"b113-17\">The BIA did not abuse its discretion in denying Chowdhury\u2019s motion to reopen, because Chowdhury\u2019s many arguments that counsel was incompetent failed to establish prejudice. First, Chowdhury argues that counsel was ineffective for failing to present sufficient evidence of his continuous physical presence or good moral character. The BIA correctly ruled that any failure of counsel to develop those factors did not prejudice Chowdhury, because the agency assumed those factors were met and denied his application solely for failure to establish hardship.</p>\n<p id=\"b113-18\">Second, Chowdhury argues that counsel failed to warn him about cross-examination, causing his testimony to appear \u201cuntrustworthy.\u201d But again he cannot show prejudice, because the IJ did not find that Chowdhury lacked credibility.</p>\n<p id=\"b113-19\">Third, Chowdhury argues that his former counsel should have elicited testimony <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"86\">*86</page-number>regarding the hardship his wife would suffer if she accompanied him to Bangladesh. As the BIA observed, Chowdhury and his wife testified \u201cunequivocally\u201d at his merits hearing that she would <em>not </em>return to Bangladesh, making any missing evidence of hardship in Bangladesh irrelevant.</p>\n<p id=\"b114-4\">Fourth, he faults his counsel for not further developing the record regarding his wife\u2019s future hardship if she remained in the United States after his removal, particularly her health issues, her troubled former marriage, and her difficulties with household chores. But these issues were in fact developed below, through his wife\u2019s testimony and affidavit. Chowdhury himself concedes that the IJ elicited testimony on these issues and he presents no new facts unavailable during the initial hearing.</p>\n<p id=\"b114-5\">Because the BIA did not abuse its discretion in denying Chowdhury\u2019s motion to reopen as untimely, we need not reach the BIA\u2019s alternative findings. As to Chowdhury\u2019s new claim that the BIA should have exercised its authority to reopen <em>sua sponte, </em>this Court lacks jurisdiction to review the BIA\u2019s exercise of its <em>sua sponte </em>authority absent alleged errors of law. <em>Mahmood v. Holder, </em>570 F.3d 466, 469 (2d Cir.2009).</p>\n<p id=\"b114-6\">For the foregoing reasons, the petition for review is DENIED.</p>\n</opinion>\n</casebody>\n",
