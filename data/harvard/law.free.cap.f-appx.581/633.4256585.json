Qwest Disability Plan, </em>454 Fed.Appx. 611 (9th Cir.2011) (unpublished), in his Employee Retirement Income Security Act (\u201cERISA\u201d) action challenging Qwest Disability Services\u2019 (\u201cQDS\u201d) termination of his long-term disability benefits under the Qwest Disability Plan (\u201cthe Plan\u201d). We <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"634\">*634</page-number>have jurisdiction under 28 U.S.C. \u00a7 1291. We affirm.</p>\n<p id=\"b662-4\">We review <em>de novo </em>the district court\u2019s grant of a motion for summary judgment and the \u201cdistrict court\u2019s choice and application of the standard of review to decisions by fiduciaries in ERISA cases.\u201d <em>Nolan v. Heald Coll., </em>551 F.3d 1148, 1153 (9th Cir. 2009) (internal quotation marks and citation omitted). We review the district court\u2019s decision to exclude extrinsic evidence for abuse of discretion. <em>Muniz v. Amec Constr. Mgmt., Inc., </em>623 F.3d 1290, 1294 (9th Cir.2010).</p>\n<p id=\"b662-5\">Here, the district court did not err in concluding that QDS, the third-party administrator of the Plan, did not abuse its discretion in terminating Kludka\u2019s long-term disability benefits. Although QDS committed two procedural errors \u2014 failing to specify what documents Kludka could submit to perfect his claim under 29 C.F.R. \u00a7 2560.503 \u2014 l(g)(l)(iii) and failing to investigate whether Kludka was still receiving Social Security benefits \u2014 these errors, neither individually nor cumulatively, amounted to an abuse of discretion. <em>See Salomaa v. Honda Long Term Disability Plan, </em>642 F.3d 666, 676 (9th Cir.2011) (holding that abuse of discretion exists only when \u201cwe are left with a definite and firm conviction that a mistake has been committed\u201d (internal quotation marks omitted)). Kludka has failed to identify any documents he could have introduced that would have perfected his claim.</p>\n<p id=\"b662-6\">Furthermore, the district court did not err in failing to consider Kludka\u2019s extrinsic evidence of QDS\u2019s alleged conflict of interest. \u201cJudicial review of an ERISA plan administrator\u2019s decision on the merits is limited to the administrative record....\u201d <em>Montour v. Hartford Life &amp; Acc. Ins. Co., </em>588 F.3d 623, 632 (9th Cir.2009). Kludka relies on <em>Abatie v. Alta Health &amp; Life Ins. Co., </em>458 F.3d 955 (9th Cir.2006) (en banc), for the proposition that appellate courts can supplement the administrative record, but there we found flagrant procedural abuses that are not present here. <em>See id. </em>at 972-73. Accordingly, excluding such evidence was not an abuse of discretion. <em>See Orr v. Bank of Am., NT &amp; SA, </em>285 F.3d 764, 773 (9th Cir.2002) (holding that abuse of discretion exists only where \u201cevidentiary ruling was manifestly erroneous <em>and </em>prejudicial\u201d).</p>\n<p id=\"b662-10\">AFFIRMED.</p>\n<footnote label=\"*\">\n<p id=\"b661-10\"> This disposition is not appropriate for publication and is not precedent except as provided by 9th Cir.
