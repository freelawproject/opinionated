Nov. 23, 2012), <em>aff'g </em>No. A087 638 556 (Immig. Ct. New York City Aug. 23, 2011). We assume the parties\u2019 familiarity with the underlying facts and procedural history in this case.</p>\n<p id=\"b52-17\">Under the circumstances of this case, we review the decisions of both the IJ and the BIA. <em>See Yun-Zui Guan v. Gonzales, </em>432 F.3d 891, 394 (2d Cir.2005) (per curiam). The applicable standards of review are well established. <em>See 8 </em>U.S.C. \u00a7 1252(b)(4)(B); <em>see also Xiu Xia Lin v. Mukasey, </em>534 F.3d 162, 165-66 (2d Cir. 2008) (per curiam).</p>\n<p id=\"b52-18\">For applications such as Dolma\u2019s, which are governed by the REAL ID Act, the agency may base a credibility finding on an applicant\u2019s demeanor, the plausibility of <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"25\">*25</page-number>her account, and inconsistencies in her statements, without regard to whether they go \u201cto the heart of the applicant\u2019s claim.\u201d 8 U.S.C. \u00a7 1158(b)(l)(B)(iii). \u201cWe defer therefore to an IJ\u2019s credibility determination unless, from the totality of the circumstances, it is plain that no reasonable fact-finder could make such an adverse credibility ruling.\u201d <em>Xiu Xia Lin, </em>534 F.3d at 167.</p>\n<p id=\"b53-5\">Initially, Dolma does not contest the agency\u2019s reliance on her inconsistent testimony about the date of her arrest, which the agency found went to the heart of her claim. She has therefore waived review of that determination in this Court. <em>See Yueqing Zhang v. Gonzales, </em>426 F.3d 540, 542 n. 1 (2d Cir.2005).</p>\n<p id=\"b53-6\">The agency\u2019s adverse credibility determination was also reasonably based on Dolma\u2019s inconsistent testimony concerning the length of her detention. <em>See </em>8 U.S.C. \u00a7 1158(b)(l)(B)(iii). Dolma initially testified that she was detained for about two months but later testified that she was detained for one month and 11 days. While Dolma argues that her testimony was consistent, \u201csupport for a contrary inference \u2014 even one more plausible or more natural \u2014 does not suggest error,\u201d <em>Siewe v. Gonzales, </em>480 F.3d 160, 168 (2d Cir.2007). We therefore defer to the agency\u2019s inconsistency finding.</p>\n<p id=\"b53-7\">The agency\u2019s adverse credibility determination was also properly based on the implausibility of Dolma\u2019s testimony that she knew almost nothing about her husband\u2019s pro-Tibet activities. Indeed, Dolma was unable to state what posters her husband had hung, who he had hung them with, whether he supported the Olympics being held in China, and whether he opposed China\u2019s occupation of Tibet. Although we have cautioned against implausibility findings that are based on flawed reasoning, <em>see e.g., Cao He Lin v. U.S. Dep\u2019t of Justice, </em>428 F.3d 391, 403 (2d Cir.2005), it was reasonable for the agency to expect Dolma to know more about her husband\u2019s activities because they were the catalyst for her arrest, detention, and decision to leave China. <em>See Xiu Xia Lin, </em>534 F.3d at 167.</p>\n<p id=\"b53-9\">The agency also reasonably relied on Dolma\u2019s hesitant demeanor in finding her not credible. <em>See </em>8 U.S.C. \u00a7 1158(b)(l)(B)(iii); <em>see also Tu Lin v. Gonzales, </em>446 F.3d 395, 400-01 (2d Cir. 2006) (emphasizing that because demeanor is \u201cvirtually always evaluated subjectively and intuitively,\u201d an IJ\u2019s assessment of an applicant\u2019s demeanor merits \u201cgreat deference\u201d). The IJ noted long pauses on the record when Dolma was questioned about her lack of knowledge of her husband\u2019s pro-Tibet activities and about the duration of her detention. <em>See Li Hua Lin v. U.S. Dep\u2019t of Justice, </em>453 F.3d 99, 109 (2d Cir. 2006) (observing that we may be more \u201cmore confident in our review of observations about an applicant\u2019s demeanor where ... they are supported by specific examples of inconsistent testimony\u201d). While Dolma takes issue with the IJ\u2019s characterization of her demeanor as hesitant, where, as here, the agency\u2019s inference \u201cis tethered to the evidentiary record, we will accord deference to the finding.\u201d <em>See Siewe, </em>480 F.3d at 168-69.</p>\n<p id=\"b53-10\">Based on the foregoing, we find that the agency\u2019s adverse credibility determination is supported by substantial evidence because it cannot be said \u201cthat no reasonable fact-finder could make such an adverse credibility ruling.\u201d <em>Xiu Xia Lin, </em>534 F.3d at 167. The agency therefore did not err in denying asylum, withholding of removal, and CAT relief because all three claims shared the same factual predicate. <em>See Paul v. Gonzales, </em>444 F.3d 148, 156 (2d Cir.2006); <em>Xue Hong Yang v. U.S. Dep\u2019t of Justice, </em>426 F.3d 520, 523 (2d Cir.2005).</p>\n<p id=\"b54-3\"><page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"26\">*26</page-number>For the foregoing reasons, the petition for review is DENIED. As we have completed our review, any stay of removal that the Court previously granted in this petition is VACATED, and any pending motion for a stay of removal in this petition is DISMISSED as moot. Any pending request for oral argument in this petition is DENIED in accordance with Federal Rule of Appellate Procedure 34(a)(2), and Second Circuit Local Rule 34.1(b).</p>\n</opinion>\n</casebody>\n",
