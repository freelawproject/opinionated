Research and Development Trust (\u201cSorensen\u201d) appeals from the final judgment of the United States District Court for the Central District of California awarding attorney fees to Homeland Housewares, LLC (\u201cHomeland\u201d) under 35 U.S.C. \u00a7 285. Because we conclude that the court did not abuse its discretion in finding the case \u201cexceptional\u201d and in setting the award amount, we affirm.</p>\n<p id=\"b906-22\">Background</p>\n<p id=\"b906-23\">Sorensen owns the rights to U.S. Patent No. 6,599,460 (the \u201c'460 patent\u201d), which <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"879\">*879</page-number>claims a method for injecting fluid plastic into a molding as part of the manufacture of \u201cthin walls\u201d in plastic products. In March 2011, Sorensen sent a cease-and-desist letter to Homeland, asserting that Homeland\u2019s Magic Bullet product \u2014 a food blender sold with plastic cup attachments \u2014 infringed the '460 patent. One month later, Homeland sought a declaratory judgment of non-infringement, invalidity, and unenforceability of the '460 patent. Sorensen then filed a counterclaim, alleging that three of Homeland\u2019s blender products infringed the patent.</p>\n<p id=\"b907-5\">After the district court issued its claim construction order, Homeland moved for summary judgment of non-infringement. In granting summary judgment, the court found that Sorensen had produced no admissible evidence that Homeland\u2019s products infringed three claim limitations of the '460 patent.<footnotemark>1</footnotemark></p>\n<p id=\"b907-6\">After the court granted summary judgment of non-infringement, Homeland continued to pursue its declaratory judgment claims, moving for summary judgment of invalidity. In opposing Homeland\u2019s motion, Sorensen filed the report of expert Dr. Tim A. Osswald (the \u201cOsswald Report\u201d). The court struck the Osswald Report because, in addition to material related to the patent\u2019s validity, the report included material related to infringement that was not before the court when the issue of infringement was decided. The court ordered Sorensen to remove the infringement-related material. Sorensen then filed a redacted version of the Osswald Report, which the court accepted. The court ultimately denied Homeland\u2019s motion for summary judgment of invalidity, and granted summary judgment in favor of Sorensen that Homeland had not produced sufficient evidence to proceed with its invalidity claims.</p>\n<p id=\"b907-9\">In April 2013, Homeland moved for attorney fees under 35 U.S.C. \u00a7 285. Sorensen filed an opposition to Homeland\u2019s motion, attaching the unredacted Osswald Report as an exhibit. Homeland moved to strike the report.</p>\n<p id=\"b907-10\">. The court partially granted Homeland\u2019s motion for attorney fees, awarding Homeland $253,777.37. The court limited the award to fees connected to Homeland\u2019s defense through August 23, 2012 \u2014 the date of the hearing on Homeland\u2019s motion for summary judgment of non-infringement. With respect to that infringement portion of the litigation, the court found that Sorensen\u2019s conduct was \u201cexceptional.\u201d The court faulted Sorensen for filing unsolicited briefs after issues were taken under submission, as well as for filing multiple motions for reconsideration that the court deemed were without merit. The court was most troubled, however, by Sorensen\u2019s repeated failures to introduce admissible evidence of infringement.</p>\n<blockquote id=\"b907-11\">Sorensen\u2019s repeated unreasonable litigation conduct unjustifiably burdened the Court, Homeland, and even itself, because developing the evidence would have been simpler, less costly, and potentially more effective than its paper litigation strategy. While this case would not necessarily have been simple had it been litigated properly, it would have either have cleared the threshold hurdle of showing that the dimensions <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"880\">*880</page-number>of the accused product indicate potential infringement, or it would have stopped them. Regardless of the adequacy of its pre-filing investigation or Sorensen\u2019s state of mind, it was clear and convincing misconduct to make Homeland litigate infringement given the state of Sorensen\u2019s evidence of the accused products\u2019 dimensions.</blockquote>\n<p id=\"b908-4\">J.A. 11.</p>\n<p id=\"b908-5\">Although the court awarded attorney fees connected to Homeland\u2019s non-infringement defense, the court declined to award fees for Homeland\u2019s subsequent pursuit of its invalidity claims. The court also denied Homeland\u2019s request for fees for its discovery costs because Homeland already had an opportunity to demonstrate Sorensen\u2019s discovery misconduct when litigating its motions to compel. Moreover, the court denied Homeland\u2019s request to award the cost of its experts, explaining that the \u201cconduct in this case does not seem to meet the standard of uncleanliness above and beyond that required for the exceptional case standard.\u201d J.A. 12 (citing <em>MarcTec, LLC v. Johnson &amp; Johnson, </em>664 F.3d 907, 921 (Fed.Cir.2012); <em>Takeda Chem. Indus., Ltd. v. Mylan Labs., Inc., </em>549 F.3d 1381, 1391 (Fed.Cir.2008)).</p>\n<p id=\"b908-6\">Finally, the court granted Homeland\u2019s motion to strike the unredacted Osswald Report, which the court found was not relevant to the issues raised by Homeland\u2019s request for attorney fees. The redacted report remained in the record.</p>\n<p id=\"b908-7\">Sorensen timely appeals. Sorensen requests that we reverse the award of attorney fees on the basis that the district court erred in finding the case exceptional. In the event that we disagree that the district court\u2019s \u201cexceptional case\u201d finding was in error, Sorensen asks that we vacate and remand on the basis that the court failed to limit the award to the costs that Homeland incurred in responding to specific acts of litigation misconduct. Sorensen also requests that we reverse the district court\u2019s order striking the Osswald Report.</p>\n<p id=\"b908-9\">We have jurisdiction pursuant to 28 U.S.C. \u00a7 1295(a)(1).</p>\n<p id=\"b908-10\">Discussion</p>\n<p id=\"b908-11\">\u201cThe court in exceptional cases may award reasonable attorney fees to the prevailing party.\u201d 35 U.S.C. \u00a7 285. As the Supreme Court recently clarified, \u201can \u2018exceptional\u2019 case is simply one that stands out from others with respect to the substantive strength of a party\u2019s litigating position (considering both the governing law and the facts of the case) or the unreasonable manner in which the ease was litigated.\u201d <em>Octane Fitness, LLC v. ICON Health &amp; Fitness, Inc., </em>\u2014 U.S. -, 134 S.Ct. 1749, 1756, 188 L.Ed.2d 816 (2014). The Court elaborated that \u201c[district courts may determine whether a case is \u2018exceptional\u2019 in the case-by-case exercise of their discretion, considering the totality of the circumstances.\u201d <em>Id. </em>Moreover, we must apply \u201can abuse-of-discretion standard in reviewing all aspects of a district court\u2019s \u00a7 285 determination.\u201d <em>Highmark Inc. v. Allcare Health Mgmt. Sys., Inc., </em>\u2014 U.S. -, 134 S.Ct. 1744, 1749, 188 L.Ed.2d 829 (2014). Under this deferential standard of review, we conclude that the district court did not abuse its discretion in finding Sorensen\u2019s conduct \u201cexceptional.\u201d</p>\n<p id=\"b908-16\">As we suggested in affirming the district court\u2019s summary judgment of non-infringement, Sorensen did not seem to understand its obligation to produce evidence in opposing summary judgment. Once Homeland pointed out the absence of evidence in Sorensen\u2019s case, the burden shifted to Sorensen to \u201cdesignate specific facts showing that there is a genuine issue for trial.\u201d <em>Homeland, </em>No. 2013-1345, -1383, Slip Op. at 9 (quoting <em>Celotex Corp. v. Catrett, </em>477 U.S. 317, 324, 106 S.Ct. 2548, <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"881\">*881</page-number>91 L.Ed.2d 265 (1986)). Sorensen, however, appeared unprepared or unwilling to satisfy its burden. Although Sorensen repeatedly attacked Homeland\u2019s evidence, it failed to produce its own admissible evidence of infringement. As the district court observed, \u201cafter more than a year of opportunities to take discovery and run tests, Sorensen [had] presented no evidence whatsoever ... and [had] not even suggested what type of evidence it might present in that regard.\u201d J.A. 2863.</p>\n<p id=\"b909-5\">In addition to lamenting the lack of admissible evidence of infringement, the district court mentioned Sorensen\u2019s repetitive and unsolicited filings. Although we have doubts that the unsolicited filings described by the district court, standing alone, could justify an \u201cexceptional case\u201d finding, we see no abuse of discretion in the court factoring in this conduct as part of its consideration of the \u201ctotality of the circumstances.\u201d <em>Octane, </em>134 S.Ct. at 1756.</p>\n<p id=\"b909-6\">We agree with Sorensen that \u201c[a] patent holder has the right to vigorously enforce its presumptively valid patent.\u201d Appellant\u2019s Br. 13. But vigorous enforcement \u201ccannot overpower a litigant\u2019s and its counsel\u2019s obligation to file cases reasonably based in law and fact and to litigate those cases in good faith.\u201d <em>Eon-Net LP v. Flagstar Bancorp, </em>653 F.3d 1314, 1328 (Fed.Cir.2011). The district court here did not abuse its discretion in finding this case \u201cexceptional\u201d based on Sorensen\u2019s failure to produce admissible evidence of infringement, as well as Sorensen\u2019s overall conduct during the litigation.</p>\n<p id=\"b909-7\">Turning to the district court\u2019s calculation of attorney fees, we find that the district court did not abuse its discretion in determining the award amount. We have long afforded district courts \u201cconsiderable discretion\u201d in determining the amount of reasonable attorney fees under \u00a7 285, as we respect \u201cthe district court\u2019s superior understanding of the litigation and the desirability of avoiding frequent appellate review of what essentially are factual matters.\u201d <em>Bywaters v. United States, </em>670 F.3d 1221, 1228 (Fed.Cir.2012) (quoting <em>Hensley v. Eckerhart, </em>461 U.S. 424, 437, 103 S.Ct. 1933, 76 L.Ed.2d 40 (1983)). The district court here was reasonably careful in calculating the award. The court independently reviewed Homeland\u2019s billing entries line by line and, as discussed in the Background, <em>supra </em>at 879-80, limited the award to costs incurred by Homeland prior to the court\u2019s grant of summary judgment of non-infringement.</p>\n<p id=\"b909-9\">Sorensen argues that the district court\u2019s fee calculation was not sufficiently rooted in the conduct that the court found exceptional. The district court, Sorensen contends, should have limited the award to the costs that Homeland incurred in responding to specific acts of litigation misconduct. We decline, however, to require such granularity from the district court, particularly because it is the \u201ctotality of the circumstances,\u201d and not just discrete acts of litigation conduct, that justify the court\u2019s award of fees. <em>See Octane, </em>134 S.Ct. at 1756.</p>\n<p id=\"b909-10\">Finally, we find no abuse of discretion in the district court\u2019s decision to strike the unredacted Osswald Report. Sorensen asserts that the full report demonstrated the reasonableness of its infringement theory and was thus relevant to the question of whether Sorensen\u2019s litigation conduct merited the award of attorney fees to Homeland. Most of the redacted portions of the report, however, appear to address the inadequacy of Homeland\u2019s evidence of non-infringement, not the adequacy (or presence) of Sorensen\u2019s evidence of infringement. To the extent the report focuses on affirmative evidence of infringement, it relies on computer simulations run by Sorensen <em>after </em>the court found for <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"882\">*882</page-number>Homeland on summary judgment of non-infringement. As the district court suggested, tests conducted after summary judgment of non-infringement have little relevance in assessing the reasonableness of Sorensen\u2019s conduct during the infringement portion of the litigation.</p>\n<p id=\"b910-4\">For the reasons stated above, the district court\u2019s judgment is affirmed.</p>\n<p id=\"b910-5\">AFFIRMED</p>\n<footnote label=\"1\">\n<p id=\"b907-7\">. Sorensen challenged the district court\u2019s grant of summary judgment of non-infringement in a companion appeal. No. 13-1345, which we address today in a separate opinion affirming the judgment of the district court.
