The Hoseins\u2019 convictions stemmed from their multi-week endeavor to fraudulently secure a credit card and several auto loans. On appeal, the Hoseins challenge aspects of their sentences. We affirm.</p>\n<p id=\"b228-9\">Generally, we review a sentence for reasonableness, using \u201can abuse-of-discretion standard.\u201d <em>Gall v. United States, </em>552 U.S. 38, 51, 128 S.Ct. 586, 169 L.Ed.2d 445 (2007). We must first review for \u201csignificant procedural error[s],\u201d including, among other things, improperly calculating the Guidelines range and failing to adequately explain the chosen sentence. <em>Id. </em>Only if we find a sentence procedurally reasonable may we consider its substantive reasonableness. <em>Id.</em></p>\n<p id=\"b228-10\">First, Nazim questions whether the district court adequately explained its consideration of <em>United States Sentencing Guidelines Manual </em>(\u201cUSSG\u201d) \u00a7 5D1.1(c) (2012) when deciding to impose a term of supervised release. We reject Nazim\u2019s contention that he properly preserved this issue, and we review for plain error. <em>United States v. Maxwell, </em>285 F.3d 336, 339 (4th Cir.2002) (noting standard of review); <em>see also United States v. Dominguez-Alvarado, </em>695 F.3d 324, 327-28 (5th Cir.2012) (applying plain error review to \u00a7 5Dl.l(c) claim when defendant only summarily objected to term of supervised release).</p>\n<p id=\"b228-12\">Nazim\u2019s suggestion that the district court\u2019s explanation of his sentence was insufficient overlooks the court\u2019s thorough examination of the 18 U.S.C. \u00a7 3553(a) (2012) factors, Nazim\u2019s personal characteristics, and the circumstances of his offenses, all given immediately prior to the court\u2019s imposition of supervised release. Thus, there was no plain error in the district court\u2019s failure to elaborate further when considering U.S.S.G. \u00a7 5Dl.l(c).</p>\n<p id=\"b228-13\">We are similarly unpersuaded by Sherina\u2019s challenge to her sentence. Sherina argues that the district court should have granted her a reduction in her offense level under U.S.S.G. \u00a7 3B1.2 (2012) because Nazim exerted control over her and directed the couple\u2019s fraud scheme. \u201cIn assessing a challenge to a sentencing court\u2019s application of the Guidelines, we review the court\u2019s factual findings for clear error and its legal conclusions de novo.\u201d <em>United States v. Alvarado Perez, </em>609 F.3d 609, 612 (4th Cir.2010) (internal quotation marks omitted).</p>\n<p id=\"b228-14\">Section 3B1.2 provides a downward adjustment for a defendant who is \u201csubstantially less culpable than the average participant.\u201d U.S.S.G. \u00a7 3B1.2 cmt. n. 3(A). \u201c[T]he critical inquiry for a sentencing court, in considering a \u00a7 3B1.2 adjustment, is not just whether the defendant has done fewer bad acts than [her] codefendants, but whether the defendant\u2019s conduct is <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"201\">*201</page-number>material or essential to committing the offense.\u201d <em>United States v. Powell, </em>680 F.3d 350, 359 (4th Cir.) (internal quotation marks omitted), <em>cert. denied, </em>\u2014 U.S. -, 133 S.Ct. 376, 184 L.Ed.2d 222 (2012). Thus, the court must \u201cmeasure the defendant\u2019s individual acts and relative culpability against the elements of the offense of conviction.\u201d <em>Id. </em>(internal quotation marks omitted). Sherina had the burden of showing by a preponderance of the evidence that she played a minor role in the offense. <em>Id. </em>at 358-59.</p>\n<p id=\"b229-7\">Here, as the district court noted, Sherina\u2019s presence, signature, and affirmance of various misstatements on multiple credit applications was essential to the Hoseins\u2019 fraud. The fact that Nazim was the instigator and directed Sherina\u2019s actions does not negate the fact that she was indispensable to their repeated crimes. <em>See United States v. Kerr, </em>13 F.3d 203, 206-07 (7th Cir.1993). Accordingly, we find no clear error in the district court\u2019s refusal to grant Sherina the benefit of \u00a7 3B1.2. <em>See Powell, </em>680 F.3d at 359. Sherina\u2019s summary claim that her within-Guidelines sentence is substantively unreasonable also fails. <em>United States v. Montes-Pineda, </em>445 F.3d 375, 379 (4th Cir.2006).</p>\n<p id=\"b229-8\">Accordingly, we affirm the district court\u2019s judgments. We dispense with oral argument because the facts and legal contentions are adequately presented in the materials before this court and argument would not aid in the decisional process.</p>\n<p id=\"b229-9\">\n<em>AFFIRMED.</em>\n</p>\n</opinion>\n</casebody>\n",
