Even if the ALJ erred by failing to state the definite weight he accorded that physician\u2019s opinion, the potential error was harmless.</p>\n<p id=\"b869-12\">About the lay opinion evidence, the ALJ gave sufficient consideration to the third-party function report completed by Han-back\u2019s friend; and the ALJ\u2019s rejection of the report is supported by substantial evidence.</p>\n<p id=\"b869-13\">Moreover, the ALJ\u2019s hypothetical questions to the vocational expert were not incomplete because the questions were consistent with the RFC assessment and fully incorporated the limitations in the RFC assessment; the ALJ was unrequired to instruct the vocational expert to assume conditions that the ALJ did not find to exist based on the evidence in the record.</p>\n<p id=\"b869-14\">AFFIRMED.</p>\n</opinion>\n</casebody>\n",
