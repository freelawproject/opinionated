He also moves for the appointment of appellate counsel.</p>\n<p id=\"b387-5\">Our review of the cases relied upon by the district court confirms that Flentroy had at least three prior civil rights complaints or appeals dismissed as frivolous or for failure to state a claim and, thus, he has three strikes. <em>See </em>\u00a7 1915(g); <em>Flentroy v. Klock, </em>No. 9:11-cv-5 (E.D. Tex. June 23, 2011); <em>Flentroy v. Oliver, </em>No. 9:11-cv-7 (E.D.Tex. Feb. 8, 2011); <em>Flentroy v. Lamb, </em>No. 9:11-cv21 (E.D.Tex. May 24, 2011); <em>Flentroy v. Lamb, </em>467 Fed.Appx. 291, 291-92 (5th Cir.2012). Contrary to Flentroy\u2019s assertion, the partial dismissal of his \u00a7 1983 complaint as frivolous and for failure to state a claim in <em>Flentroy, </em>No. 9:11-cv-21, counts as a strike. <em>See Adepegba v. Hammons, </em>103 F.3d 383, 387-88 (5th Cir.1996); <em>Patton v. Jefferson Correctional Center, </em>136 F.3d 458, 462-63 (5th Cir.1998).</p>\n<p id=\"b387-6\">Flentroy has failed to demonstrate that he was under imminent danger of serious physical injury at the time that he sought to file his complaint in the district court, proceed with his appeal, or move to proceed IFP. <em>See </em>\u00a7 1915(g); <em>Banos v. O\u2019Guin, </em>144 F.3d 883, 884 (5th Cir.1998). His allegation that he might be seriously injured at an indefinite point in the future if he has to travel in a Texas Department of Criminal Justice transportation van is insufficient to establish that he was in imminent danger of serious physical injury at the relevant time. <em>See </em>\u00a7 1915(g); <em>Banos, </em>144 F.3d at 884-85.</p>\n<p id=\"b387-7\">Thus, Flentroy\u2019s motion for leave to proceed IFP is DENIED. His motion for appointment of counsel also is DENIED. The appeal is DISMISSED as frivolous. <em>See </em>5th Cir. R. 42.2.</p>\n<footnote label=\"*\">\n<p id=\"b386-37\"> Pursuant to 5th Cir. R. 47.5, the court has determined that this opinion should not be <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"359\">*359</page-number>published and is not precedent except under the limited circumstances set forth in 5th Cir. R. 47.5.4.</p>\n</footnote>\n</opinion>\n</casebody>\n",
