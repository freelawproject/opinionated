ANDERSON, Circuit Judge.</author>\n<p id=\"b744-18\">After examining the briefs and appellate record, this panel has determined unanimously that oral argument would not materially assist in the determination of this appeal. See Fed. R.App. P. 34(a)(2); 10th Cir. R. 34.1(G). The case is therefore ordered submitted without oral argument.</p>\n<p id=\"b744-19\">Defendant and Appellant, Ramon Lafayette Lake, appeals his ninety-five month sentence imposed following his plea of guilty to one count of conspiracy to possess with intent to distribute and to distribute controlled substances, in violation of 21 U.S.C. \u00a7 846. We affirm.</p>\n<p id=\"b744-20\">BACKGROUND</p>\n<p id=\"b744-21\">This is the second time Mr. Lake\u2019s appeal has been addressed by this court. Mr. Lake had been indicted along with his son, Landry Sean Lake. As our prior decision in this case stated, the basic facts relevant to this appeal are as follows:</p>\n<blockquote id=\"b744-22\">Mr. Lake and his son were both addicted to opiates, including heroin. Landry Lake had been sending heroin by means of an interstate carrier from Arizona to Talihina, Oklahoma, where Mr. Lake lived and practiced dentistry. On <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"717\">*717</page-number>March 22, 2013, Mr. Lake received a package containing a small amount of heroin for his own personal use. That same day, Mr. Lake had been in contact with a friend of Landry\u2019s (an individual known as \u201cBW\u201d), who was also a drug addict. BW came to Mr. Lake\u2019s house that evening, where Mr. Lake gave BW some of the heroin he had just received for his (BWs) own use. The next morning, BW was found dead in his home and the medical examiner determined that acute heroin toxicity was the cause of death.</blockquote>\n<p id=\"b745-5\"><em>United States v. Lake, </em>530 Fed.Appx. 831, 831-32 (10th Cir.2013) (unpublished).</p>\n<p id=\"b745-6\">Mr. Lake was originally sentenced to 135 months\u2019 imprisonment, based in part on the assessment of a base offense level of thirty-eight under the advisory United States Sentencing Commission, <em>Guidelines Manual </em>(\u201cUSSG\u201d) because, pursuant to USSG \u00a7 201.1(a)(2), death (BWs) had resulted from the use of the controlled substance. Mr. Lake appealed that sentence, arguing that the district court had erred by denying his objection to the application of the \u201cdeath enhancement\u201d under USSG \u00a7 2D1.1, and had further erred in refusing to grant his request for a downward variance from the advisory Guidelines range of 135-168 months.</p>\n<p id=\"b745-7\">Following the filing of Mr. Lake\u2019s initial appellate brief, the United States Supreme Court issued its decision in <em>Alleyne v. United States, </em>\u2014 U.S. -, 133 S.Ct. 2151, 186 L.Ed.2d 314 (2013). The Court in <em>Alleyne </em>held that any finding of fact which increases the legally allowed range of possible punishment \u201cconstitutes an element of a separate aggravated offense that must be found by the jury.\u201d <em>Id. </em>at 2162. The government conceded (erroneously, as it later averred) that <em>Alleyne </em>applied to Mr. Lake\u2019s sentencing proceeding. Our court reversed the sentence and remanded for resentencing.</p>\n<p id=\"b745-11\">Mr. Lake\u2019s son, Landry, also appealed his ninety-seven month sentence. In its response brief to that appeal, the government stated that its concession of error in Mr. Lake\u2019s appeal was misguided, and that neither sentencing proceeding in Mr. Lake or his son\u2019s appeal contravened the rule announced in <em>Alleyne, </em>which applies to statutory mandatory minimum sentences rather than the advisory Guideline sentencing calculation involved in the Lake sentences. Concluding that Landry Lake\u2019s appeal was governed by law of the case, our court reversed and remanded that matter for resentencing. Landry Lake was sentenced to fifty-nine months\u2019 imprisonment on resentencing, which he has appealed.</p>\n<p id=\"b745-12\">On remanded resentencing in this (Mr. Lake\u2019s) case, the district court scheduled a sentencing hearing, and Mr. Lake filed a motion for a variance in preparation for those proceedings. He made multiple arguments for a lesser sentence and argued that a new presentence report (\u201cPSR\u201d) needed to be prepared, which did not reflect the \u201cresulting in death\u201d enhancement under USSG \u00a7 2Dl.l(a)(2). The government disagreed, arguing that a new PSR was not required, and that the \u201cresulting in death\u201d enhancement still applied and that BWs death, even if accidental, was a foreseeable result of Mr. Lake\u2019s provision of heroin to BW.</p>\n<p id=\"b745-13\">The district court ultimately ordered a new PSR, which calculated a base offense level of 14, based on the drug quantity involved, and which did not include a death enhancement. With a reduction for acceptance of responsibility, Mr. Lake\u2019s total offense level was 12, which, with a Criminal history category of I, yielded an advisory Guideline range of ten to sixteen months.</p>\n<p id=\"b746-3\"><page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"718\">*718</page-number>The government sought an upward departure based on USSG \u00a7 5K2.1 (permitting an upward departure because a death resulted), or, alternatively, an upward variance based on the 18 U.S.C. \u00a7 3558(a) factors, to the statutory maximum of twenty years. The government argued that the advisory sentencing range of ten to sixteen months did not reflect the severity of the fact that BW died as a result of Mr. Lake\u2019s distribution of heroin. This was particularly so, the government argued, because Mr. Lake continued to arrange for shipments of heroin even after BWs death. The government subsequently withdrew that motion, and sought an upward variance to a sentence similar to the one originally imposed.</p>\n<p id=\"b746-4\">Resentencing took place on April 3, 2014. After noting that a reduction was again warranted for Mr. Lake\u2019s substantial assistance to authorities under USSG \u00a7 5K1.1, the court stated that the recommended Guideline sentencing range was six to twelve months. The court then heard argument from both parties, during which numerous aggravating and mitigating sentencing factors were discussed. These included the severe consequences of Mr. Lake\u2019s offense of conviction (BWs death, even if accidental); BWs use of other substances besides the heroin Mr. Lake had given him; the illegality of heroin and its inherent dangerousness; the foreseeability of harm from the use of heroin; the relationship of Mr. Lake and BW (Mr. Lake was \u201csomething like a father figure\u201d to BW); Mr. Lake\u2019s medical history of problems stemming from primary sensory peripheral neuropathy and high blood pressure; and his criminal history (he had a criminal history score of zero). The court concluded that \u201c[a]n upward sentencing variance is warranted in this case.\u201d R. Vol. 2 at 35. The court further explained:</p>\n<blockquote id=\"b746-5\">Defendant is a long-time heroin addict who provided heroin to another individual who he also knew to be a heroin user. The individual\u2019s use of the drugs provided by this defendant resulted in and contributed to his death. The death of this acquaintance, an active investigation ... being underway, and this defendant\u2019s observation of the possible negative consequences of heroin use did not produce any notable changes in his criminal behavior. As detailed in the presentence report, subsequent to the death of [BW], this defendant continued to participate in this illegal behavior and receive heroin from his son and co-conspirator, Landry Lake. By continuing to participate in the illegal behavior, the defendant established that he does pose a risk to the public and that an adequate sentence of imprisonment is needed in this case to protect the public from further crimes of this defendant, to provide just punishment.</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b746-6\">This Court finds that any sentence imposed in accordance with the calculated guideline range would fail to reflect the seriousness of the offense, and it would not promote a respect for the law, and would fail to provide just punishment for the offense.</blockquote>\n<p id=\"b746-7\"><em>Id. </em>at 35-36. The court accordingly sentenced Mr. Lake to ninety-five months. As the court further explained:</p>\n<blockquote id=\"b746-9\">In formulating the sentence imposed, this Court has considered the nature and circumstances of the offense, as well as the characteristics and criminal history of the defendant. The Court has further taken into consideration the sentencing guideline calculations contained within the presentence report, in addition to any objections, clarifications, additions, or deletions to those guideline calculations identified in the addendum to the report or announced in open court <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"719\">*719</page-number>today. While the Court recognizes that it is not bound by the sentencing guideline calculations, the Court has considered them and finds them to be advisory in nature.</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b747-5\">The Court has chosen to vary upward when imposing a sentence for this defendant in order to meet the objectives set forth in [18 U.S.C. \u00a7 3553(a) ]. The sentence prescribed by this Court reflects the seriousness of the offense, promotes respect for the law, and provides just punishment for the offense. This sentence affords adequate deterrence to criminal conduct, protects the public from further crimes of this defendant, and provides correctional treatment for the defendant in the most effective manner. The Court notes for the record that this is the same sentence the Court would impose if given the broadest possible discretion, and the same sentence the Court would impose notwithstanding any judicial fact finding occurring by adoption of the presentence report or at this hearing.</blockquote>\n<p id=\"b747-6\"><em>Id. </em>at 3\u00cdM0. This appeal followed.</p>\n<p id=\"b747-7\">DISCUSSION</p>\n<p id=\"b747-8\">Mr. Lake argues that the district court committed \u201cprocedural error\u201d and \u201csubstantive error\u201d by \u201cimposing an unreasonable sentence of ninety-five months based on an upward variance.\u201d Appellant\u2019s Br. at 2.</p>\n<p id=\"b747-9\">We review all sentencing decisions for abuse of discretion. <em>United States v. Huckins, </em>529 F.3d 1312, 1317 (10th Cir.2008). Our review proceeds in two steps. First, we consider whether the district court committed procedural error. <em>United States v. Lente, </em>647 F.3d 1021, 1030 (10th Cir.2011). Procedural error \u201crelates to the method by which the sentence is calculated.\u201d <em>Id. </em>(further quotation omitted). The Supreme Court has recognized at least five types of procedural error: (1) improper calculation of the Guidelines range; (2) adherence to the Guidelines as if they are mandatory; (3) failure to consider the 18 U.S.C. \u00a7 3553(a) sentencing factors; (4) basing a sentence on clearly erroneous facts; and (5) failure to adequately explain the sentence. <em>See id. </em>(citing <em>Gall v. United States, </em>552 U.S. 38, 50-51, 128 S.Ct. 586, 169 L.Ed.2d 445 (2007)).</p>\n<p id=\"b747-11\">Substantive reasonableness \u201cinvolves whether the length of the sentence is reasonable given all the circumstances of the case in light of the factors set forth in 18 U.S.C. \u00a7 3553(a).\u201d <em>United States v. Conlan, </em>500 F.3d 1167, 1169 (10th Cir.2007). We review for an abuse of discretion. Where there is a variance, the appellate court \u201cmay consider the extent of the deviation, but must give due deference to the district court\u2019s decision that the \u00a7 3553(a) factors, on a whole, justify the extent of the variance.\u201d Gall, 552 U.S. at 51, 128 S.Ct. 586. \u201cThe fact that the appellate court might reasonably have concluded that a different sentence was appropriate is insufficient to justify reversal of the district court.\u201d <em>Id.</em></p>\n<p id=\"b747-12\">Mr. Lake argues the district court committed procedural error in imposing his sentence because it \u201cdid not consider all the \u00a7 3553(a) factors including material, non-frivolous arguments raised by Mr. Lake in mitigation and did not adequately explain the chosen sentence.\u201d Appellant\u2019s Br. at 10. More specifically, Mr. Lake claims the court:</p>\n<blockquote id=\"b747-13\">did not address Mr. Lake\u2019s arguments that there were factors under \u00a7 3553(a) that mitigated against an upward variance or the extent of any deviation, including the facts that Mr. Lake was not a drug dealer, had distributed only once to the deceased, had not distributed to anyone after the death, had no prior criminal history, and was 62 and had <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"720\">*720</page-number>serious physical health issues, that the death was not planned but was accidental, that Mr. Lake had a history of community service, and that the deceased was a polysubstance abuser.</blockquote>\n<p id=\"b748-4\"><em>Id. </em>at 11-12.</p>\n<p id=\"b748-5\">Because Mr. Lake did not object to the procedure by which the district court determined his sentence, we may review it only for plain error. <em>United States v. Ruiz-Terrazas, </em>477 F.3d 1196, 1199 (10th Cir.2007) (holding that where a defendant \u201cdoes not object to the procedure by which his sentence was determined and explained, we may reverse the district court\u2019s judgment only in the presence of plain error.\u201d). Plain error is \u201c(1) error, (2) that is plain, (3) which affects the defendant\u2019s substantial rights and (4) which seriously affects the fairness, integrity, or public reputation of judicial proceedings.\u201d <em>United States v. Romero, </em>491 F.3d 1173, 1178 (10th Cir.2007); <em>see also United States v. Poe, </em>556 F.3d 1113, 1128 (10th Cir.2009). This standard \u201cpresents a heavy burden for an appellant, one which is not often satisfied.\u201d <em>Romero, </em>491 F.3d at 1178; <em>see also United States v. Crowe, </em>735 F.3d 1229, 1242 (10th Cir.2013).</p>\n<p id=\"b748-6\">Mr. Lake claims the district court failed to consider all the relevant sentencing factors and ignored those favoring a lower sentence. We have stated that a district court \u201cmust state its reasons for imposing a given sentence,\u201d but it \u201cis not obligated to expressly weigh on the record each of the factors set out in \u00a7 3553(a).\u201d <em>United States v. Sanchez-Juarez, </em>446 F.3d 1109, 1116 (10th Cir.2006). Nor is the court required to \u201crecite any magic words to show us that it fulfilled its responsibility to be mindful of the factors that Congress has instructed it to consider.\u201d <em>Id. </em>We recognize, however, that an appellate court will not \u201csimply presume the district court weighed a party\u2019s argument in light of the \u00a7 3553(a) factors where the record provides no indication that it did so and no clear explanation of the sentence imposed.\u201d <em>Id. </em>(further citations omitted).</p>\n<p id=\"b748-8\">In this case, the district court adequately explained the sentence imposed and why a variance was required. As the excerpts quoted above indicate, the district court explained its reasons, and it clearly indicated that it had considered the \u00a7 3553(a) sentencing factors. We perceive no plain error at all in this case.</p>\n<p id=\"b748-9\">We next consider Mr. Lake\u2019s argument that his sentence is substantively unreasonable. We give substantial deference to the district court\u2019s analysis of the sentencing factors:</p>\n<blockquote id=\"b748-10\">The sentencing judge is in a superior position to find facts and judge their import under \u00a7 3553(a) in the individual case. The judge sees and hears the evidence, makes credibility determinations, has full knowledge of the facts and gains insights not conveyed by the record____ The sentencing judge has access to, and greater familiarity with, the individual case and the individual defendant before him than the ... appeals court.... Moreover, the district courts have an institutional advantage over appellate courts in making these sorts of determinations, especially as they see so many more Guidelines cases than appellate courts do.</blockquote>\n<p id=\"b748-12\"><em>Gall, </em>552 U.S. at 51-52, 128 S.Ct. 586; <em>see also United States v. Smart, </em>518 F.3d 800, 808 (10th Cir.2008) (\u201cWe may not examine the weight a district court assigns to various \u00a7 3553(a) factors, and its ultimate assessment of the balance between them, as a legal conclusion to be reviewed de novo. Instead, we must give due deference to the district court\u2019s decision that the \u00a7 3553(a) factors, on a whole, justify the extent of the variance.\u201d (further quotation omitted)). \u2018We reverse only when the district court <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"721\">*721</page-number>\u2018renders a judgment that is arbitrary, capricious, whimsical or manifestly unreasonable.\u2019 \u201d <em>United States v. Martinez, </em>610 F.3d 1216, 1227 (10th Cir.2010) (quoting <em>United States v. Friedman, </em>554 F.3d 1301, 1307 (10th Cir.2009)).</p>\n<p id=\"b749-5\">We have carefully reviewed the entire record in this case. It is clear that the district court considered all the relevant sentencing factors and demonstrated a clear familiarity with all of the facts and circumstances surrounding Mr. Lake\u2019s offense and his overall situation. We cannot say that the sentence imposed is arbitrary, capricious, whimsical or manifestly unreasonable.</p>\n<p id=\"b749-6\">CONCLUSION</p>\n<p id=\"b749-7\">For the foregoing reasons, we AFFIRM the sentence imposed in this case.</p>\n<footnote label=\"*\">\n<p id=\"b744-13\"> This order and judgment is not binding precedent, except under the doctrines of law of the case, res judicata, and collateral estoppel. The court generally disfavors the citation of orders and judgments; nevertheless, an order and judgment may be cited under the terms and conditions of 10th Cir. R. 32.1.</p>\n</footnote>\n</opinion>\n</casebody>\n",
