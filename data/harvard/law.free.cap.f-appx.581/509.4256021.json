The district court granted judgment on the pleadings to the defendants, holding that Martin had failed to state a malicious-prosecution claim. We affirm.</p>\n<p id=\"b538-8\">I.</p>\n<p id=\"b538-9\">On February 14, 2009, Lindsay Breitenstine picked up Holly Yost in a Chevrolet Cavalier. They drove to the home of Breitenstine\u2019s ex-boyfriend, Tim Roerich. Breitenstine parked in Roerich\u2019s driveway, exited the car, broke open Roerich\u2019s front door, and stole money and marijuana from the home. Breitenstine then returned to the car and drove away with Yost. During the burglary, Dustin Wheeler was standing outside a house across the street. He saw the Cavalier pull into Roerich\u2019s driveway and observed a brown-haired woman in her early 20s, about 5'3\" in height, exit the car and go into Roerich\u2019s house. Martin, the plaintiff here, is 5'8\" in height.</p>\n<p id=\"b538-12\">Later, Breitenstine and Yost told police that Martin had participated in the burglary and had accompanied Breitenstine into Roerich\u2019s home. Deputy Joel Marmet went to Martin\u2019s home to investigate. Tim Martin \u2014 Martin\u2019s father \u2014 told Deputy Marmet that his daughter had been home with him when the burglary occurred. Tim Martin offered to provide a written statement, but Marmet declined. Although four other family members were also present at the Martin home, Marmet left without interviewing any of them. He did not investigate the burglary further.</p>\n<p id=\"b538-14\">In March 2009, the Wayne County Prosecutor\u2019s Office informed Marmet that it lacked sufficient evidence to prosecute Martin for the burglary. The Prosecutor\u2019s Office also suggested to Marmet that he should find Martin and obtain her statement. Marmet did not try to locate Martin, or to obtain additional evidence.</p>\n<p id=\"b538-15\">In January 2010, Martin completed boot camp for the United States Marine Corps. That same month, the Prosecutor\u2019s Office presented evidence to a grand jury about the events of February 14, 2009. The grand jury indicted Martin on one count of burglary. Thereafter, a judge issued an arrest warrant for Martin. She was arrested in December 2010. After Martin\u2019s arrest, the Marine Corps dishonorably discharged her from service.</p>\n<p id=\"b538-16\">Martin was tried for burglary in May 2011. Four of her family members \u2014 the ones present at Martin\u2019s home when Deputy Marmet interviewed Tim Martin \u2014 testified that she had been home with her father on the day of the burglary. Wheeler testified that he had seen only two women at the scene of the burglary, neither of whom was Martin. After deliber<page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"511\">*511</page-number>ating 35 minutes, the jury acquitted Martin.</p>\n<p id=\"b539-5\">In May 2013, Martin sued Marmet, Wayne County Sheriff Thomas Maurer, and the Wayne County Commissioners under 42 U.S.C. \u00a7 1983, claiming they had maliciously prosecuted her. She also brought state-law claims. The district court granted the defendants judgment on the pleadings on Martin\u2019s malicious-prosecution claim and declined to exercise supplemental jurisdiction over the state-law claims. This appeal followed.</p>\n<p id=\"b539-6\">II.</p>\n<p id=\"b539-7\">We review de novo a district court\u2019s grant of judgment on the pleadings under Rule 12(c). <em>Albrecht v. Treon, </em>617 F.3d 890, 893 (6th Cir.2010). To survive a Rule 12(c) motion, a complaint must contain sufficient factual matter, accepted as true, to state a claim to relief that is plausible on its face. <em>Id.</em></p>\n<p id=\"b539-8\">A.</p>\n<p id=\"b539-9\">Martin first challenges the dismissal of her malicious-prosecution claim against Deputy Marmet and Sheriff Maurer in their individual capacities. A malicious-prosecution claim under \u00a7 1983 has four elements: first, that the defendant \u201cmade, influenced, or participated\u201d in the decision to prosecute the plaintiff; second, that the prosecution lacked probable cause; third, that the criminal proceeding caused a deprivation of the plaintiff\u2019s liberty apart from the initial seizure; and fourth, that the criminal proceeding resolved in the plaintiffs favor. <em>Sykes v. Anderson, </em>625 F.3d 294, 308-09 (6th Cir.2010) (internal quotations and punctuation omitted).</p>\n<p id=\"b539-10\">We focus on the second element here. Martin was arrested on the burglary charge following a grand jury indictment. Subject to one exception, a valid grand jury indictment \u201cconclusively determines the existence of probable cause.\u201d <em>See Robertson v. Lucas, </em>753 F.3d 606, 616 (6th Cir.2014) (internal quotation marks omitted). The exception applies when the defendants knowingly present false testimony to the grand jury. <em>Id. </em>Here, there is no allegation that Marmet or Maurer presented false testimony to the grand jury to obtain the indictment. The indictment therefore established probable cause for Martin\u2019s prosecution, and her malicious-prosecution claim fails.</p>\n<p id=\"b539-12\">Martin offers three reasons why she thinks Deputy Marmet and Sheriff Maurer are potentially liable nonetheless. First, Martin argues that the officers withheld \u201ccrucial exculpatory evidence\u201d from the grand jury, including the statements of Wheeler and Tim Martin. But the government has no duty to provide potentially exculpatory evidence to the grand jury. <em>See United States v. Angel, </em>355 F.3d 462, 475 (6th Cir.2004). So this argument fails.</p>\n<p id=\"b539-13\">The second argument is similar: that Deputy Marmet and Sheriff Maurer withheld this exculpatory evidence \u201cfrom the prosecution during the pendency of the criminal case.\u201d But this allegation is absent from Martin\u2019s complaint; and Federal Rule of Civil Procedure 8 requires the plaintiff\u2019s complaint to \u201cgive the defendant fair notice of what the claim is and the grounds upon which it rests.\u201d <em>See Robertson, </em>753 F.3d at 623 (internal quotation marks omitted). Thus, this argument also fails.</p>\n<p id=\"b539-14\">Finally, Martin argues that, after she was indicted, Deputy Marmet and Sheriff Maurer failed to obtain exculpatory evidence that was readily available and that would have eliminated probable cause for prosecuting her. Specifically, she says that Marmet failed to show Wheeler a photo array with her photograph, failed to <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"512\">*512</page-number>interview Martin\u2019s alibi witnesses or Martin herself, failed to search the crime scene for evidence, and failed to investigate the accuracy of Yost\u2019s and Breitenstine\u2019s statements. But once probable cause is established \u2014 here, by the grand jury indictment \u2014 the police have no constitutional duty to investigate further or to seek potentially exculpatory evidence. <em>See Ahlers v. Schebil, </em>188 F.3d 365, 371-72 (6th Cir. 1999). Deputy Marmet\u2019s investigation did not violate Martin\u2019s constitutional rights.</p>\n<p id=\"b540-4\">B.</p>\n<p id=\"b540-5\">Martin also challenges the dismissal of her <em>Monell </em>claim against the Wayne County Commissioners and Maurer and Marmet in their official capacities. Under <em>Monell, </em>a municipality can be liable under \u00a7 1983 when an official \u201cpolicy or custom\u201d caused a violation of the plaintiffs constitutional rights. <em>See Monell v. Dep\u2019t of Soc. Servs. of City of N.Y., </em>436 U.S. 658, 694-95, 98 S.Ct. 2018, 56 L.Ed.2d 611 (1978). A municipality cannot be liable under <em>Monell </em>absent an underlying constitutional violation. <em>Robertson, </em>753 F.3d at 622. Here, because Martin\u2019s complaint failed to state a constitutional violation, the district court correctly held that her <em>Monell </em>claim likewise fails.</p>\n<p id=\"b540-6\">Martin responds that <em>Moldowan v. City of Warren, </em>578 F.3d 351, 394 n. 20 (6th Cir.2009), supports her position that a municipality can be liable under <em>Monell </em>absent a constitutional violation by one of its employees. But Martin misreads this case. Our decision in <em>Moldowan </em>\u2014 and specifically the footnote upon which Martin relies \u2014 does not say that a plaintiff can proceed with a <em>Monell </em>claim even absent a constitutional violation. Rather, we merely said that, on the record before us in that appeal, the absence of a constitutional violation by one officer left open the possibility of a violation by another. <em>Id.</em></p>\n<p id=\"b540-7\">One can certainly sympathize with Martin\u2019s distress regarding the consequences of her prosecution. But her complaint does not describe a violation of federal law, and thus she has no remedy under \u00a7 1983. The district court\u2019s judgment is affirmed.</p>\n</opinion>\n</casebody>\n",
