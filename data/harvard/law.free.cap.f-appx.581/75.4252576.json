May 21, 2013), <em>aff'g </em>No. A201 151 537 (Immig. Ct. N.Y. City May 22, 2012). We assume the parties\u2019 familiarity with the underlying facts and procedural history of this case.</p>\n<p id=\"b104-8\">Under the circumstances of this case, the Court should review both the IJ\u2019s and the BIA\u2019s opinions \u201cfor the sake of completeness.\u201d <em>Zaman v. Mukasey, </em>514 F.3d 233, 237 (2d Cir.2008). The applicable standards of review are well established. <em>See </em>8 U.S.C. \u00a7 1252(b)(4)(B); <em>see also Xiu Xia Lin v. Mukasey, </em>534 F.3d 162, 165-66 (2d Cir.2008).</p>\n<p id=\"b104-9\">For asylum applications, like Weng\u2019s, governed by the REAL ID Act, the agency may, \u201c[cjonsidering the totality of the circumstances,\u201d base a credibility finding on inconsistencies in the applicant\u2019s statements and other record evidence without regard to whether they go \u201cto the heart of the applicant\u2019s claim.\u201d 8 U.S.C. \u00a7 1158(b)(l)(B)(iii); <em>Xiu Xia Lin, </em>534 F.3d at 163-64.</p>\n<p id=\"b104-10\">Substantial evidence supports the adverse credibility determination. In finding Weng not credible, the agency reasonably relied on the fact that her testimony was inconsistent with statements made during a credible fear interview regarding when and whether she practiced Christianity in China. In making this finding, the agency reasonably concluded that the record of Weng\u2019s credible fear interview was sufficiently reliable: it consisted of a typed account of the questions asked and answered with the assistance of a translator, which reflected that the interviewer explained the reasons for the interview, and posed questions designed to elicit information regarding a potential asylum claim. <em>See Ming Zhang v. Holder, </em>585 F.3d 715, 724-25 (2d Cir.2009). The record of Weng\u2019s border interview also exhibits these hallmarks of reliability. <em>Id.; see also Ramsameachire v. Ashcroft, </em>357 F.3d 169, 179-80 (2d Cir.2004).</p>\n<p id=\"b104-11\">For the foregoing reasons, the petition for review is DENIED. As we have completed our review, any stay of removal that the Court previously granted in this petition is VACATED, and any pending motion for a stay of removal in this petition is DISMISSED as moot. Any pending request for oral argument in this petition is DENIED in accordance with Federal Rule of Appellate Procedure 34(a)(2), and Second Circuit Local Rule 34.1(b).</p>\n</opinion>\n</casebody>\n",
