McConico argues that the district court had jurisdiction based on diversity under 28 U.S.C. \u00a7 1332. We affirm the district court.</p>\n<p id=\"b866-20\">We review <em>de novo </em>a district court\u2019s order dismissing a case for lack of subject matter jurisdiction, viewing the facts in the light most favorable to the plaintiff. <em>Parise v. Delta Airlines, Inc., </em>141 F.3d 1463, 1465 (11th Cir.1998). District courts have subject matter jurisdiction based on diversity if the amount in controversy exceeds $75,000 and the case is between citizens of different states. \u00a7 1332(a). For diversity to exist there must be complete diversity: \u201cevery plaintiff must be diverse from every defendant.\u201d <em>Triggs v. John Crump Toyota, Inc., </em>154 F.3d 1284, 1287 (11th Cir. 1998). When invoking federal jurisdiction based on diversity, a plaintiff must allege facts showing diversity exists by \u201cinclud[ing] the citizenship of each party, so that the court is satisfied that no plaintiff is a citizen of the same state as any defendant.\u201d <em>Travaglio v. Am. Expresss Co., </em>735 F.3d 1266, 1268 (11th Cir.2013). Natural persons are citizens of the state where they are domiciled. <em>McCormick v. Aderholt, </em>293 F.3d 1254, 1257 (11th Cir.2002) (per curiam). A corporation is a citizen of its state of incorporation and of the state where it has its principal place of business. \u00a7 1332(c)(1).</p>\n<p id=\"b866-22\">Diversity did not exist here. In his complaint, the plaintiff, McConico, alleged Alabama citizenship for himself and four of the named individual defendants. He also alleged that the defendant-corporation, The Cochran Firm, had its principal place of business in, and is therefore a citizen of, Alabama. Due to the lack of complete diversity, the district court lacked subject matter jurisdiction. The district court did not err in dismissing the case.</p>\n<p id=\"b866-23\">AFFIRMED.</p>\n</opinion>\n</casebody>\n",
