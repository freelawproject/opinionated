Walker, pro se, a native and citizen of Jamaica, seeks review of a January 16, 2013 order of the BIA denying his fifth motion to reopen his deportation proceedings. <em>In re Jeffrey A. Walker, </em>No. A018 566 067 (B.I.A. Jan. 16, 2013). We assume the parties\u2019 familiarity with the underlying facts and procedural history in this case.</p>\n<p id=\"b92-16\">Despite Walker\u2019s conviction for a firearms offense, we retain jurisdiction to review questions of law, such as his claim to derivative citizenship. 8 U.S.C. \u00a7 1252(a)(2)(D); <em>Duarte-Ceri v. Holder, </em>630 F.3d 83, 87 (2d Cir.2010). Where a petition presents a claim to citizenship, we determine whether material issues of fact exist regarding citizenship, applying the same standards applied to summary judgment motions. <em>Agosto v. INS, </em>436 U.S. 748, 754, 98 S.Ct. 2081, 56 L.Ed.2d 677 (1978). Walker has the burden of establishing a prima facie case for derivative citizenship. <em>See id. </em>at 756, 98 S.Ct. 2081.</p>\n<p id=\"b92-17\">Walker\u2019s claim is governed by former 8 U.S.C. \u00a7 1432(a), the derivative citizenship statute in effect in 1979, when his mother apparently naturalized. In dispute here is the statute\u2019s requirement that a parent naturalize before the child\u2019s eighteenth birthday. Walker argues that his case is analogous to <em>Poole v. Mukasey, </em>522 F.3d 259 (2d Cir.2008), in which we remanded for the BIA to consider a derivative citizenship claim because it appeared that the alien\u2019s mother applied for naturalization when Poole was sixteen, but the application was not processed until after he turned eighteen. <em>Id. </em>at 265-66.</p>\n<p id=\"b93-4\"><page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"65\">*65</page-number>However, <em>Poole </em>did not announce a rule that an alien is entitled to derivative citizenship if there was a delay in processing a naturalization application. Further, Walker did not establish that his mother applied for naturalization prior to his eighteenth birthday. His evidence consisted of a pre-sentence report stating that he was a U.S. citizen, which has no bearing on his actual citizenship status since it was prepared by the Probation Office; his prison identification card, which contains no information about his citizenship; and his own uncorroborated affidavit. He thus failed to meet his burden of proof. <em>Nwozuzu v. Holder, </em>726 F.3d 323, 332 (2d Cir.2013).</p>\n<p id=\"b93-5\">Walker submitted additional evidence to this Court, but we are precluded from reviewing it. 8 U.S.C. \u00a7 1252(b)(4)(A) (\u201c[T]he court of appeals shall decide the petition only on the administrative record on which the order of removal is based____\u201d). Even if we were to consider the new evidence, it would not establish a prima facie case for derivative citizenship.</p>\n<p id=\"b93-8\">We have considered the remaining arguments and find them to be without merit. Accordingly, for the foregoing reasons, the petition is DENIED.</p>\n</opinion>\n</casebody>\n",
