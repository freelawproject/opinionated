Cox admitted to each of those violations. The district court revoked his supervision and imposed a 12-month term of reimprisonment. Based on the same criminal conduct, Cox also pleaded guilty to possession of cocaine base with intent to distribute, <em>see </em>21 U.S.C. \u00a7 841(b)(1)(B), and possession of a firearm during a drug trafficking crime, <em>see </em>18 U.S.C. \u00a7 924(c). The district court imposed sentences of 262 months\u2019 and 60 months\u2019 imprisonment, respectively, to run consecutively to each other and to the term of reimprisonment. Cox filed a notice of appeal in each case, but his appointed attorney asserts that all possible claims in these consolidated appeals are frivolous and moves to withdraw under <em>Anders v. California, </em>386 U.S. 738, 87 S.Ct. 1396, 18 L.Ed.2d 493 (1967). Cox has not accepted our invitation to comment on counsel\u2019s motion. <em>See </em>Cir. R. 51(b). Counsel submitted a brief that explains the nature of these cases and addresses the issues that appeals of this kind might be expected to involve. Because the analysis in the brief appears to be thorough, we limit our review to the subjects counsel discusses. <em>See United States v. Bey, </em>748 F.3d 774, 776 (7th Cir.2014); <em>United States v. Wagner, </em>103 F.3d 551, 553 (7th Cir.1996).</p>\n<p id=\"b602-16\">Counsel tells us that Cox does not wish to have his guilty plea set aside, and thus counsel appropriately forgoes discussing the voluntariness of the plea or the adequacy of Cox\u2019s plea colloquy. <em>See United States v. Konczak, </em>683 F.3d 348, 349 (7th Cir.2012); <em>United States v. Knox, </em>287 F.3d 667, 670-71 (7th Cir.2002). Counsel does not say whether Cox wants to dispute the revocation of his supervised release, but nonetheless such an argument would be frivolous because Cox admitted violating conditions of his release, <em>see </em>18 U.S.C. \u00a7 3583(e)(3), and revocation and reimprisonment were mandatory because one of those conditions prohibits unlawful possession of controlled substances, <em>see id. </em>\u00a7 3583(g)(1); <em>United States v. Hondras, </em>296 F.3d 601, 602 (7th Cir.2002).</p>\n<p id=\"b602-17\">Counsel next considers whether Cox could challenge the reasonableness of his prison sentence, and we agree with him that such a challenge would be frivolous. First, the district court properly designated Cox a career offender based on his two prior felony convictions for controlled-substance offenses, <em>see </em>U.S.S.G. \u00a7 4Bl.l(a). Second, Cox\u2019s 262-month sentence was at the bottom of his calculated guidelines range (262-327 months, based on a total offense level of 34 and criminal-history category of VI). Counsel gives no reason <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"575\">*575</page-number>to disregard the presumption that this within-guidelines sentence is reasonable, see <em>Rita v. United States, </em>551 U.S. 388, 347, 127 S.Ct. 2456, 168 L.Ed.2d 203 (2007); <em>United States v. Womack, </em>732 F.3d 745, 747 (7th Cir.2013), and we see none. The court considered the relevant 18 U.S.C. \u00a7 3553(a) factors \u2014 including the nature and circumstances of his offense (especially the way he moved up the ladder to become a major cocaine supplier), his history and characteristics (particularly his repeat offenses in spite of his intelligence, leadership skills, and potential), and the need to protect the community from similar crimes. Furthermore, Cox received the statutory-minimum' sentence of 60 months\u2019 imprisonment for the firearm conviction, so a challenge to its reasonableness necessarily would be frivolous. <em>See United States v. Johnson, </em>580 F.3d 666, 673 (7th Cir.2009).</p>\n<p id=\"b603-5\">Regarding the period of reimprisonment for the supervised-release violation, counsel did not identify a basis for challenging the guidelines range of 51 to 63 months\u2014 statutorily capped at 60 months, <em>see </em>18 U.S.C. \u00a7 3583(e)(3) \u2014 based on a criminal-history category of VI and his \u201cGrade A\u201d controlled-substance violations. <em>See </em>U.S.S.G. \u00a7\u00a7 7Bl.l(a)(l), 7B1.4(a); <em>United States v. Snyder, </em>635 F.3d 956, 960 (7th Cir.2011). Given the court\u2019s discussion of relevant \u00a7 3553(a) factors, as noted above, we would not conclude that a below-guidelines sentence of 12 months was plainly unreasonable. <em>See United States v. Berry, </em>583 F.3d 1032, 1034 (7th Cir.2009); <em>United States v. Neal, </em>512 F.3d 427, 438-39 (7th Cir.2008).</p>\n<p id=\"b603-6\">Counsel\u2019s motion to withdraw is GRANTED, and the appeal is DISMISSED.</p>\n</opinion>\n</casebody>\n",
