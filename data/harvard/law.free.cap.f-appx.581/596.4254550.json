On appeal, Linn asserts that the district court did not <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"597\">*597</page-number>adequately prevent the jury from becoming aware that he was incarcerated at the time of the trial, improperly denied his motion for a new trial, and applied the wrong legal standard in assessing the motion.</p>\n<p id=\"b625-5\">After careful review, we conclude that the district court appropriately handled Linn\u2019s status as an inmate and that, in any event, Linn suffered no prejudice because the jury could infer that he was incarcerated from the circumstances of the case and his own testimony. <em>Cf. Holloway v. Alexander, </em>957 F.2d 529, 530 (8th Cir.1992) (no prejudice can result from jury seeing that which is already known). We also conclude that the district court did not abuse its discretion in denying Linn\u2019s motion for a new trial, <em>see PFS Distribution Co. v. Raduechel, </em>574 F.3d 580, 589 (8th Cir. 2009) (denial of motion for new trial is reviewed for abuse of discretion; district court\u2019s decision is virtually unassailable on appeal and will only be reversed when there is absolute absence of evidence to support jury\u2019s verdict), and that the district court applied the appropriate legal standard in assessing that motion, <em>see White v. Pence, </em>961 F.2d 776, 780-81 (8th Cir.1992). Accordingly, we affirm. <em>See </em>8th Cir. R. 47B.</p>\n<footnote label=\"1\">\n<p id=\"b624-23\">. The Honorable D.P.
