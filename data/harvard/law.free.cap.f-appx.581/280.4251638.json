In his initial appeal, Greene\u2019s counsel filed a brief pursuant to <em>Anders v. California, </em>386 U.S. 738, 87 S.Ct. 1396, 18 L.Ed.2d 493 (1967), asserting that there were no meritorious arguments for appeal. During the pendency of the appeal, the Government revealed that one of its trial witnesses had engaged in misconduct, including taking evidence relevant to Greene\u2019s trial. In our decision, we took no position on this issue, because Greene had filed a motion for a new trial in the district court on the same basis. Thus, we determined that the district court should address the issue in the first instance. In reviewing Greene\u2019s remaining arguments, we affirmed the convictions but vacated the sentence and remanded for resentencing in light of the rule announced in <em>Dorsey v. United States, </em>\u2014 U.S.-, 132 S.Ct. 2321, 183 L.Ed.2d 250 (2012).</p>\n<p id=\"b309-13\">On remand, the district court denied Greene\u2019s motion for a new trial without an evidentiary hearing. The court resentenced Greene to forty years\u2019 imprisonment for the drug conspiracy and twenty years\u2019 imprisonment for the robbery conspiracy to run consecutively. In the present appeal, Greene challenges his sentence and the court\u2019s decision not to have an evidentiary hearing on his motion for a new trial. We affirm.</p>\n<p id=\"b309-14\">We review a sentence for reasonableness, applying \u201ca deferential abuse-of-discretion standard.\u201d <em>Gall v. United States, </em>552 U.S. 38, 46, 128 S.Ct. 586, 169 L.Ed.2d 445 (2007). We must first ensure that the district court committed no \u201csignificant procedural error,\u201d including improper calculation of the advisory Sentencing Guidelines range, insufficient consideration of the \u00a7 3553(a) factors, and inadequate explanation of the sentence imposed. <em>Gall, </em>552 U.S. at 51, 128 S.Ct. 586 <em>see United States v. Lynn, </em>592 F.3d 572, 575 (4th Cir.2010). In announcing a sentence, the district court is not required to \u201crobotically tick through \u00a7 3553(a)\u2019s every subsection, particularly when imposing a within-Guidelines sentence.\u201d <em>United States v. Powell, </em>650 F.3d 388, 395 (4th Cir.2011) (internal quotation marks omitted). The court must, however, conduct an \u201cindividualized assessment justifying the sentence imposed and rejection of arguments for a higher or lower sentence based on \u00a7 3553.\u201d <em>Lynn, </em>592 F.3d at 584 (internal quotation marks omitted).</p>\n<p id=\"b309-15\">The district court must provide sufficient explanation to \u201cdemonstrate that it \u2018considered the parties\u2019 arguments and ha[d] a reasoned basis for exercising [its] own legal decisionmaking authority.\u2019 \u201d <em>Lynn, </em>592 F.3d at 576 (quoting <em>Rita v. United States, </em>551 U.S. 338, 356, 127 S.Ct. <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"282\">*282</page-number>2456, 168 L.Ed.2d 203 (2007)). Such explanation is required to \u201cpromote the perception of fair sentencing\u201d and to permit \u201cmeaningful appellate review.\u201d <em>Gall, </em>552 U.S. at 50, 128 S.Ct. 586. We apply a presumption of reasonableness on appeal to a within-Guidelines range sentence. <em>Rita, </em>551 U.S. at 347, 127 S.Ct. 2456; <em>see United States v. Allen, </em>491 F.3d 178, 193 (4th Cir.2007) (\u201cA sentence within the proper Sentencing Guidelines range is presumptively reasonable.\u201d) (citation omitted).</p>\n<p id=\"b310-4\">We find no error with the district court\u2019s imposition of sentence. The district court incorporated many of the findings from the first sentencing and addressed fully Greene\u2019s argument for a thirty-year sentence. We have considered Greene\u2019s arguments made in this appeal and conclude that the arguments are without merit.</p>\n<p id=\"b310-5\">Greene claims that he was entitled to an evidentiary hearing on his motion for a new trial. We review the district court\u2019s decision in this regard for abuse of discretion. <em>United States v. Smith, </em>62 F.3d 641, 651 (4th Cir.1995). Because the court was very familiar with the trial evidence and the grounds Greene was asserting for a new trial, the court did not abuse its discretion declining to have an evidentiary hearing. <em>United States v. Hamilton, </em>559 F.2d 1370, 1373-74 (5th Cir.1977).</p>\n<p id=\"b310-6\">Accordingly, we affirm the sentence and the court\u2019s denial of Greene\u2019s motion for a new trial. We dispense with oral argument because the facts and legal contentions are adequately presented in the materials before this Court and argument would not aid the decisional process.</p>\n<p id=\"b310-7\">\n<em>AFFIRMED.</em>\n</p>\n</opinion>\n</casebody>\n",
