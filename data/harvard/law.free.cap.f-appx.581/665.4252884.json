He also appeals the district court\u2019s denial of an acceptance-of-responsibility adjustment under U.S.S.G. \u00a7 3E1.1 and challenges the substantive reasonableness of his 87-month sentence. We have jurisdiction under 28 U.S.C. \u00a7 1291. For the reasons discussed below, we affirm.</p>\n<p id=\"b694-9\">Border agents stopped Garcia-Vasquez at the Calexico Port of Entry as he attempted to drive his car from Mexico into California. During the stop, the agents discovered 10.38 pounds of 99.4%-pure methamphetamine, worth over $100,000, in dollar-bill-sized containers lining a compartment under the car. The agents also found a one-way Greyhound bus ticket from Los Angeles to Tijuana, dated four days before the stop, in the glove box. Garcia-Vasquez was the driver, registered owner, and sole occupant of the car containing the drugs. A jury convicted Garcia-Vasquez of conspiracy to distribute methamphetamine and importation of methamphetamine. Garcia-Vasquez argues that there is insufficient evidence of a conspiracy, his intent to distribute methamphetamine, and his knowledge of the methamphetamine in his car. We disagree.</p>\n<p id=\"b694-14\">A conspiracy \u201cagreement need not be explicit, but may be inferred from circumstantial evidence, and once the existence of a conspiracy is established, evidence establishing beyond a reasonable doubt a connection of a defendant with the conspiracy, even though the connection is slight, is sufficient to convict him with knowing participation in the conspiracy.\u201d <em>United States v. Melchor-Lopez, </em>627 F.2d 886, 891 (9th Cir.1980) (internal citations and quotation marks omitted). Evidence at trial established that Garcia-Vasquez had a distributable amount of drugs in a highly customized compartment underneath his car. A border agent gave expert testimony that Garcia-Vasquez\u2019s attempted importation fit the modus operandi of how drug cartels smuggle drugs into the United States. The agent also testified that the drug containers found inside the compartment served a dual purpose: they held drugs going into the United States and were the perfect size to smuggle United States currency back into Mexico.</p>\n<p id=\"b694-15\">From this circumstantial evidence, the jury could infer that Garcia-Vasquez was part of a conspiracy to distribute drugs. The jury could also infer Garcia-Vasquez\u2019s intent to distribute from the amount, puri<page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"667\">*667</page-number>ty, and value of the drags found in his car. <em>See United States v. Savinovich, </em>845 F.2d 834, 838 (9th Cir.1988) (defendant\u2019s possession of four pounds of high-purity cocaine, worth $100,000, was sufficient to infer intent to distribute). The jury was free to infer Garcia-Vasquez\u2019s knowledge of the drugs from the quantity of drugs in his car and the fact that Garcia-Vasquez was the driver, owner, and sole occupant of the car. <em>See United States v. Mora, </em>876 F.2d 76, 77-78 (9th Cir.1989) (quantity); <em>United States v. Diaz-Cardenas, </em>351 F.3d 404, 407 (9th Cir.2003) (driver and sole occupant). The jury could also infer from the one-way bus ticket that he had not taken his car to Mexico for repairs, as he claimed, but instead went to Mexico to knowingly procure drugs. The expert testimony, dual-purpose drug containers, and bus ticket distinguish this case from <em>United States v. Rubio-Villareal, </em>927 F.2d 1495 (9th Cir.1991), <em>on reh\u2019g, </em>967 F.2d 294 (9th Cir.1992) (en banc).</p>\n<p id=\"b695-5\">As for Garcia-Vasquez\u2019s sentence, the district court did not err in denying Garcia-Vasquez a \u00a7 3E1.1 adjustment for acceptance of responsibility. \u201cThis adjustment is not intended to apply to a defendant who puts the government to its burden of proof at trial by denying the essential factual elements of guilt,\u201d as Garcia-Vasquez did. U.S.S.G. \u00a7 3E1.1 application note 2. That Garcia-Vasquez went to trial to delay negative immigration consequences does not convince us otherwise. The district court also made a sufficient record justifying Garcia-Vasquez\u2019s sentence at the low end of the Guidelines range. We therefore cannot say that Garcia-Vasquez\u2019s 87-month sentence was substantively unreasonable.</p>\n<footnote label=\"**\">\n<p id=\"b694-16\"> This disposition is not appropriate for publication and is not precedent except as provided by 9th Cir.
