During sentencing, the district court heard allocution from a person who was not a victim of Velasquez-Rivera\u2019s federal conviction, but was a purported victim of related criminal conduct listed in the pre-sentence report. Velasquez-Rivera contends the court abused its discretion because the person was not a victim as defined under 18 U.S.C. \u00a7 3771(e) (2012). We conclude there was no error and affirm.</p>\n<p id=\"b267-10\">Under 18 U.S.C. \u00a7 3661 (2012), at sentencing \u201c[n]o limitation shall be placed on the information concerning the background, character, and conduct of a person convicted of an offense which a court of the United States may receive and consider for the purpose of imposing an appropriate sentence.\u201d Under \u00a7 3661, the sentencing court has the discretion to \u201cconduct an inquiry broad in scope, largely unlimited either as to the kind of information [they] may consider, or the source from which it may come.\u201d <em>Pepper v. United States, </em>\u2014 U.S.-,-, 131 S.Ct. 1229, 1240, 179 L.Ed.2d 196 (2011) (internal quotation marks omitted). The court \u201chas always been free to consider the wide range of relevant material.\u201d <em>Payne v. Tennessee, </em>501 U.S. 808, 820-21, 111 S.Ct. 2597, 115 L.Ed.2d 720 (1991). We have noted that \u00a7 3661 permits the sentencing court to consider information \u201cnot directly related to [the defendant\u2019s] commission of the offense[.]\u201d <em>United States v. Kiulin, </em>360 F.3d 456, 462 (4th Cir.2004).</p>\n<p id=\"b267-14\">In this instance, the statement at issue did not affect the district court\u2019s determination of the range of imprisonment under the Sentencing Guidelines. Nor did it affect the actual sentence, because the court stated that it was not relying upon the statement in reaching an appropriate sentence, but was relying instead upon the statutory sentencing factors listed under 18 U.S.C. \u00a7 3553 (2012).</p>\n<p id=\"b267-15\">Because there was no abuse of discretion, we affirm. We dispense with oral argument because the facts and legal contentions are adequately presented in the materials before this court and argument would not aid the decisional process.</p>\n<p id=\"b267-16\">\n<em>AFFIRMED.</em>\n</p>\n</opinion>\n</casebody>\n",
