Korman, Senior District Judge for the U.S. District Court for the Eastern District of New York, sitting by designation.</p>\n</footnote>\n<opinion data-order=\"10\" data-type=\"opinion\" id=\"x999-2\" type=\"majority\">\n<p id=\"b657-5\">MEMORANDUM <footnotemark>**</footnotemark></p>\n<p id=\"b657-6\">Daniel Esparza was convicted of second degree murder. In this appeal from the denial of a petition for a writ of habeas corpus, Esparza argues that trial counsel rendered ineffective assistance by: (1) failing to highlight the inconsistencies in the state\u2019s ballistic evidence; and (2) failing to adequately investigate reports that another person had been identified as the shooter.</p>\n<p id=\"b657-7\">1. There were two different types of casings at the crime scene, including two .40 caliber spent casings directly across the street from where the victim was shot and two 9-millimeter spent casings approximately 400 feet away. The ballistics evidence established that the Glock handgun found in Esparza\u2019s possession (three weeks later) had fired the .40 caliber spent casings at the crime scene directly across from the victim. There was, however, evidence to support an argument that the bullet which struck the victim may have been fired from a 9-millimeter weapon. This evidence was developed by petitioner\u2019s trial counsel during cross-examination of the ballistics expert and, in his summation, he called attention to both the location of the shooting and the fact that the 9-millimeter casings were found there. [3 ER at 473.] Moreover, he argued from evidence that was elicited from the expert that, even if the Glock handgun was the murder weapon, the jury could find that Esparza received the Glock handgun after the shooting from a fellow gang member who used it to shoot the victim. Nevertheless, petitioner\u2019s trial counsel placed greater emphasis on discrediting the eyewitness identification.</p>\n<p id=\"b657-11\">In a written opinion, the trial judge rejected petitioner\u2019s argument that his trial counsel should have placed greater emphasis on the evidence suggesting that the murder weapon was not the Glock handgun that was found in petitioner\u2019s possession three weeks later. While petitioner\u2019s argument is not without some merit, it is not sufficient to justify habeas corpus relief. \u201cSurmounting <em>Strickland\u2019s </em>high bar is never an easy task,\u201d <em>Padilla v. Kentucky, </em>559 U.S. 356, 371, 130 S.Ct. 1473, 176 L.Ed.2d 284 (2010), and \u201c[establishing that a state court\u2019s application of <em>Strickland </em>was unreasonable under [AEDPA] \u00a7 2254(d) is all the more difficult.\u201d <em>Harrington v. Richter, </em>562 U.S. 86,-, 131 S.Ct. 770, 788, 178 L.Ed.2d 624 (2011). \u201cThe standards created by <em>Strickland </em>and \u00a7 2254(d) are both \u2018highly deferential,\u2019 and when the two apply in tandem, review is \u2018doubly\u2019 so.\u201d <em>Id. </em>(internal citations omitted). After reviewing the record, we conclude that petitioner has not met this double deferential standard.</p>\n<p id=\"b657-13\">2. Relying entirely on a defense investigator\u2019s report, which stated that Jesus Romero had been identified as the shooter but that the police had ruled him out because he was in Mexico at the time of the shooting, petitioner argues that his trial counsel should have done more to investigate the possibility that Romero was the shooter. In rejecting this claim, the trial judge observed that, \u201cthe investigative report ... does not explain how Romero was identified as the shooter. In this regard, [it] is unclear whether the \u2018identification\u2019 was in fact made by an eye witness or by some other means. Moreover, assuming identification was made by an eye witness, <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"630\">*630</page-number>Petitioner does not present evidence that the person who identified Romero as the shooter was available to testify.\u201d [1 ER at 50-51.] Under these circumstances, we cannot say that the trial judge unreasonably rejected this prong of petitioner\u2019s ineffective assistance of counsel claim.</p>\n<p id=\"b658-4\">3. Esparza also seeks to raise the uncertified issue of whether the evidence of anonymous calls to the police identifying the shooter as a member of the Langdon gang violated his right to confrontation. As the district court properly instructed the jury, however, the anonymous calls were not offered to prove that the shooter was from Langdon, but to explain the officer\u2019s next steps in the course of the investigation. <em>See United States v. Wahchumwah, </em>710 F.3d 862, 871 (9th Cir.2013). Indeed, except in unusual circumstances not present here, <em>see Bruton v. United States, </em>391 U.S. 123, 135-36, 88 S.Ct. 1620, 20 L.Ed.2d 476 (1968), \u201cjuries are presumed to follow their instructions,\u201d <em>Richardson v. Marsh, </em>481 U.S. 200, 211, 107 S.Ct. 1702, 95 L.Ed.2d 176 (1987). Moreover, the calls were not introduced into evidence to explain the basis of an expert\u2019s opinion. <em>See Williams v. Ill</em>inois, \u2014 U.S. -, 132 S.Ct. 2221, 183 L.Ed.2d 89 (2012). Thus, Esparza has failed to raise a claim that is \u201cdebatable amongst jurists of reason,\u201d <em>Miller-El v. Cockrell, </em>537 U.S. 322, 336, 123 S.Ct. 1029, 154 L.Ed.2d 931 (2003), and we decline to issue a certificate of appealability, <em>see </em>28 U.S.C. \u00a7 2253(c); <em>Hiivala v. Wood, </em>195 F.3d 1098, 1102-04 (9th Cir.1999) (per curiam).</p>\n<p id=\"b658-6\">AFFIRMED.</p>\n<footnote label=\"**\">\n<p id=\"b657-14\"> This disposition is not appropriate for publication and is not precedent except as provided by 9th Cir.
