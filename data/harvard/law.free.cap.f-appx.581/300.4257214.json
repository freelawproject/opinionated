Cooper, who was responding to a noise complaint. Michael\u2019s mother, Kimberly Sipes, as the administrator of Michael\u2019s estate, filed a wrongful death action against Cooper, Michael Ferraro, and the City of Morganton (\u201cthe City\u201d), asserting three state law claims and a claim pursuant to 42 U.S.C. \u00a7 1983 (2012). Defendants moved for summary judgment on the grounds of qualified immunity and public official immunity. The district court granted summary judgment in favor of Ferraro, but denied it with respect to Cooper and the City of Morganton. Cooper appealed.<footnotemark>*</footnotemark></p>\n<p id=\"b329-11\">This court may exercise jurisdiction only over final decisions, 28 U.S.C. \u00a7 1291 (2012), and certain interlocutory and collateral orders. 28 U.S.C. \u00a7 1292 (2012); Fed.R.Civ.P. 54(b); <em>Cohen v. Beneficial Indus. Loan Corp., </em>337 U.S. 541, 69 S.Ct. 1221, 93 L.Ed. 1528 (1949). A final decision is one that \u201cends the litigation on the merits and leaves nothing for the court to do but execute the judgment.\u201d <em>Catlin v. United States, </em>324 U.S. 229, 233, 65 S.Ct. 631, 89 L.Ed. 911 (1945). Although interlocutory orders generally are not appeal-able, an order denying a defendant\u2019s claim of qualified immunity is immediately appealable under the collateral order doctrine \u201cto the extent that it turns on an issue of law.\u201d <em>Mitchell v. Forsyth, </em>472 U.S. 511, 530, 105 S.Ct. 2806, 86 L.Ed.2d 411 (1985); <em>Iko v. Shreve, </em>535 F.3d 225, 234 (4th Cir.2008). However, a district court\u2019s determination that a genuine issue of material fact exists that precludes summary judgment on qualified immunity grounds is not immediately appealable. <em>Johnson v. Jones, </em>515 U.S. 304, 313-20, 115 S.Ct. 2151, 132 L.Ed.2d 238 (1995); <em>Culosi v. Bullock, </em>596 F.3d 195, 201 (4th Cir.2010). Thus, this court has \u201cno jurisdiction over a claim that a plaintiff has not presented enough evidence to prove that the plaintiffs version of the events actually occurred, but [the court has] jurisdiction over a claim that there was no violation of clearly established law accepting the facts as the district court viewed them.\u201d <em>Winfield v. Bass, </em>106 F.3d 525, 530 (4th Cir. 1997) (en banc).</p>\n<p id=\"b329-13\">Because the qualified immunity determination in this matter ultimately turns on presently unresolved questions of fact rather than on an evaluation of the legal significance of undisputed facts, we do not possess jurisdiction over this appeal. Therefore, we dismiss. We dispense with oral argument because the facts and legal contentions are adequately presented in the materials before this court and argument would not aid the decisional process.</p>\n<p id=\"b329-14\">\n<em>DISMISSED.</em>\n</p>\n<footnote label=\"*\">\n<p id=\"b329-16\"> The City did not join in the appeal.</p>\n</footnote>\n</opinion>\n</casebody>\n",
