Having carefully reviewed the record and considered Bryant\u2019s arguments, we find no basis for reversal. <em>See Mack v. Dillon, </em>594 F.3d 620, 622 (8th Cir.2010) (per curiam) (grant of summary judgment reviewed de novo). Construing Bryant\u2019s notice of appeal liberally, <em>see Hallquist v. United Home Loans, Inc., </em>715 F.3d 1040, 1044 (8th Cir.2013), we also conclude that the district court did not err in its earlier dismissals of defendants Ray Hobbs, Wendy Kelley, Michael Person, and Roland Anderson, <em>see Cooper v. Schriro, </em>189 F.3d 781, 783 (8th Cir.1999) (per curiam) (preservice dismissal reviewed de novo); <em>Edwards v. Edwards, </em>754 F.2d 298, 299 (8th Cir.1985) (per curiam) (dismissal for failure to serve reviewed for abuse of discretion); or its denial of Bryant\u2019s motions for appointment of counsel and to compel production of documents, see <em>Phillips v. Jasper County Jail, </em>437 F.3d 791, 794 (8th Cir.2006) (denial of appointment of counsel reviewed for abuse of discretion); <em>Stuart v. Gen. Motors Corp., </em>217 F.3d 621, 630 (8th Cir.2000) (denial of motion to compel reviewed for gross abuse of discretion).</p>\n<p id=\"b631-17\">The judgment is affirmed. <em>See </em>8th Cir. R. 47B.</p>\n<footnote label=\"1\">\n<p id=\"b631-15\">.
