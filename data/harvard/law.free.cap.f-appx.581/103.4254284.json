Fuel Distributors, LLC (\u201cNYFD\u201d). The primary issue in this case is whether, under 15 U.S.C. \u00a7 2801 <em>et seq. </em>(\u201cPetroleum Marketing Practices Act\u201d or \u201cPMPA\u201d), NYFD can terminate its agreement with Yonkers after Yonkers fell into arrears. We assume the parties\u2019 familiarity with the facts and procedural history of the case, as well as the issues on appeal.</p>\n<p id=\"b132-17\">DISCUSSION</p>\n<p id=\"b132-18\">We review a district court\u2019s denial of a preliminary injunction for abuse of discretion. <em>See Kickham Hanley P.C. v. Kodak Ret. Income Plan, </em>558 F.3d 204, 209 (2d Cir.2009). A district court abuses its discretion when its decision rests on legal error or a clearly erroneous factual finding, or when its decision cannot be located within the range of permissible decisions. <em>Id. </em>In reviewing an order denying injunctive relief under the PMPA, we examine questions of law <em>de novo </em>and questions of fact for clear error. <em>Joseph v. Sasafrasnet, LLC, </em>689 F.3d 683, 689 (7th Cir.2012).</p>\n<p id=\"b132-19\">Under the PMPA, a court \u201cshall\u201d grant a preliminary injunction if a franchisee shows: (1) \u201cthe franchise of which he is a party has been terminated,\u201d 15 U.S.C. \u00a7 2805(b)(2)(A)(i); (2) \u201cthere exist sufficiently serious questions going to the merits to make such questions a fair ground for litigation,\u201d \u00a7 2805(b)(2)(A)(ii); and (3) \u201cthe court determines that, on balance, the hardships imposed upon the franchisor by the issuance of such preliminary injunctive relief will be less than the hardship which would be imposed upon such franchisee if such preliminary injunctive relief were not granted.\u201d \u00a7 2805(b)(2)(B). On appeal, <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"105\">*105</page-number>Yonkers claims that the District Court failed to properly apply the PMPA.</p>\n<p id=\"b133-5\">Upon review of the record and the relevant case law, we conclude that the District Court did not abuse its discretion. \u201c[Failure] by the franchisee to pay to the franchisor in a timely manner when due all sums to which the franchisor is legally entitled\u201d is an enumerated ground for termination. 15 U.S.C. \u00a7 2802(c)(8). There is no dispute that Yonkers\u2019 payments to NYFD were in arrears and so, pursuant to the PMPA and the contract between the parties, NYFD was entitled to terminate the relationship.</p>\n<p id=\"b133-6\">Appellant\u2019s arguments to the contrary are unavailing. We do not require a district court to make a \u201creasonableness\u201d finding before a franchisor terminates a contract under 15 U.S.C. \u00a7 2802(c). <em>See Russo v. Texaco, Inc., </em>808 F.2d 221, 225 (2d Cir.1986) (finding that Section 2802(c) provides grounds for termination that are \u201cconclusively presumed to be reasonable as a matter of law\u201d). Nor have we required district judges to make explicit findings regarding whether a payment was \u201ctimely\u201d or whether an occurrence constituted a \u201cfailure.\u201d The District Court also acted within its discretion in rejecting the appellant\u2019s claims that the notice of termination was untimely, that there was sufficient evidence of a contract modification with regard to \u201clate payment,\u201d that the NYFD\u2019s demand letter created an opportunity for Yonkers to cure, and that common law accord and satisfaction was established in this case.</p>\n<p id=\"b133-7\">CONCLUSION</p>\n<p id=\"b133-8\">We have considered all of appellant\u2019s arguments and find them to be without merit. Accordingly, the appeal from the October 3, 2013 order of the District Court denying a preliminary injunction is AFFIRMED.</p>\n</opinion>\n</casebody>\n",
