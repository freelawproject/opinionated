(\u201cArlington\u201d) appeals from the decision of the Board of Patent Appeals and Inferences (\u201cBoard\u201d) on <em>inter partes </em>Reexamination No. 95/000,-196, affirming the final rejection of claims <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"861\">*861</page-number>1, 5, and 6 of U.S. Pat. No. 6,521,831 (\u201cthe '831 patent\u201d) as obvious under 35 U.S.C. \u00a7 103(a) in view of the prior art. Bridgeport Fittings, Inc. (\u201cBridgeport\u201d), which filed the <em>inter partes </em>reexamination request, cross appeals from the Board\u2019s decision on issues that concern the Board\u2019s affirmance of the patentability of claims 3 and 4 of the '831 patent. For the reasons that follow, we affirm the Board\u2019s decision except as to claim 3, in which respect we vacate and remand.</p>\n<p id=\"b889-5\">I. Background</p>\n<p id=\"b889-6\">Arlington and Bridgeport are direct competitors in the market for electrical connectors. Electrical connectors make connections between a junction box and electrical conductors, such as metal-clad cables, using an access hole in the junction box. <em>See </em>'831 Patent col.l 11. 44-49. Arlington owns the '831 patent, which relates to a duplex electrical connector, allowing two cables to be connected to a junction box via a single access hole. <em>See id. </em>at col.l 11. 59-61. Claim 1 of the '831 patent recites:</p>\n<blockquote id=\"b889-7\">1. A duplex electrical connector comprising:</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b889-8\">a) a housing having a cylindrical outbound end, a generally oval inbound end, and an interior channel linking said inbound and said outbound end;</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b889-9\">b) a pair of parallel openings in said inbound end;</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b889-10\">c) a tubular spring steel cable retainer secured in each of said openings in said inbound end for accepting separate cables, said retainers including a set of inwardly extending tangs to receive and engage said separate cables inserted from said inbound end and guide said separate cables toward said cylindrical outbound end in a manner that said separate cables are advanced to said outbound end, said inwardly extending tangs restricting removal of said separate cables by force applied on said separate cables from said inbound end; and</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b889-12\">d) a tubular spring steel adapter secured to said cylindrical outbound end of said housing, said adapter having outwardly extending tangs.</blockquote>\n<p id=\"b889-13\">'831 Patent col.6 1.64-col.7 1.15. Claim 3 depends from claim 1, adding that the inbound end has within it an oval-shaped insert with a pair of parallel openings with annual ridges in the rearward end of the openings. <em>Id. </em>at col.7 1.23-eol.8 1.3. Claim 4 also depends from claim 1, adding that the retainers are secured by tangs that snap into place upon insertion. <em>Id. </em>at col.8 11. 4-10. Claim 5 depends from claim 1, adding limitations regarding the number and orientation of the retainer tangs. <em>Id. </em>at col.8 11. 11-16. Claim 6 depends from claim 5, adding limitations regarding the orientation of the cable retainers and a cable passageway. <em>Id. </em>at col.8 11. 17-24.</p>\n<p id=\"b889-14\">Bridgeport sought <em>inter partes </em>reexamination of the '831 patent after Arlington accused Bridgeport\u2019s Whipper-Snap Duplex Connectors of infringing the '831 patent. <em>Arlington Indus., Inc. v. Bridgeport Fittings, Inc., </em>No. 3:06-CV-1105 (M.D.P.A.). The Board ultimately affirmed the final rejection of claims 1, 5 and 6 and the patentability of claims 3 and 4. Claim 1 was found obvious over the combination of U.S. Patent No. 1,295,304 (\u201cGrindle\u201d); U.S. Pat. No. 4,885,429 (\u201cSchnittker\u201d); and U.S. Pat. No. 2,744,-769 (\u201cRoeder\u201d). J.A. 23. Arlington did not separately argue the patentability of dependent claims 5 and 6. J.A. 44. The Board affirmed the patentability of claims 3 and 4, ruling that the priority date of those claims antedated at least one of the asserted prior art references. J.A. 48. Arlington appeals, and Bridgeport cross appeals. We have jurisdiction pursuant to 28 U.S.C. \u00a7 1295(a)(4).</p>\n<p id=\"b890-3\"><page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"862\">*862</page-number>II. Standards of Review</p>\n<p id=\"b890-4\">Obviousness is a question of law, reviewed <em>de novo, </em>based on underlying facts, the findings of which are reviewed for substantial evidence. <em>In re Kotzab, </em>217 F.3d 1365, 1369 (Fed.Cir.2000), <em>Rapoport v. Dement, </em>254 F.3d 1053, 1058 (Fed.Cir. 2001).</p>\n<p id=\"b890-5\">Likewise, priority under 35 U.S.C. \u00a7 120 is a question of law, reviewed <em>de novo, </em>based on underlying facts, the findings of which are reviewed for substantial evidence. <em>In re Daniels, </em>144 F.3d 1452, 1455 (Fed.Cir.1998).</p>\n<p id=\"b890-6\">III. Discussion</p>\n<p id=\"Ad3H\">A. Arlington\u2019s Appeal</p>\n<p id=\"b890-7\">In its appeal, Arlington raises four primary arguments. First, it contends that the prior art combination does not result in retainers \u201csecured in each of said openings in said inbound end for accepting separate cables\u201d as required by claim 1. Second, it contends that the combination of the prior art lacks \u201ctangs\u201d that \u201cguide\u201d and \u201cadvance[]\u201d cables \u201ctoward\u201d the outbound end, as required by claim 1. Third, Arlington argues that the Board failed to identify any prior art that disclosed or suggested the claimed \u201ctubular spring steel adapter\u201d and that, in fact, the prior art teaches away from such an adapter. Fourth, it argues that the Board erred in rejecting Arlington\u2019s evidence offered in support of secondary considerations of non-obviousness.</p>\n<p id=\"b890-8\">Bridgeport counters by arguing that because Arlington did not raise the issue of claim construction to the Board, it has waived argument regarding the claim language \u201csecured in each of said openings in said inbound end.\u201d Bridgeport argues that in any event, Arlington misunderstands the end point of the edge of the housing and that the prior art combination does result in retainers secured in the inbound end of the housing. Bridgeport also contends that the Board correctly found that the prior art guides or permits cable movement to the outbound end \u201cin a manner commensurate in scope with the language of independent claim 1,\u201d J.A. 25, and that Arlington did not propose an alternative construction to the Board, thus again waiving the argument. Bridgeport further argues that use of spring steel widely was known, that Arlington did not contest this knowledge at the Board, and that therefore the Board had substantial evidence on which to determine that one of skill in the art would have substituted one known element for another made of spring steel. Lastly, Bridgeport argues that the Board properly rejected the evidence of secondary considerations because Arlington\u2019s products do not embody the claims and thus lack a nexus to the claims, that Arlington failed to provide adequate evidence that customers bought Arlington\u2019s products due to allegedly claimed features, and that Arlington failed to provide evidence of market share and thus failed to show that its products were commercially successful. \u2019</p>\n<p id=\"b890-10\">1. The claimed \u201cretainers\u201d</p>\n<p id=\"b890-11\">Claim 1 requires retainers \u201csecured in each of said openings in said inbound end for accepting separate cables.\u201d Arlington argues that the combination of Grindle with Schnittker (a) lacks a retainer entirely, (b) results merely in retainers secured <em>to </em>each opening of the connector, and (c) would not have been obvious because there was no motivation to combine and because the combination requires substantial reconstruction of the prior art. The Board found that Grindle is a duplex connector with \u201cparallel inlets ... adapted to receive armor clad electrical wires\u201d that uses a set screw to hold the cables in place. J.A. 12-14; <em>see also </em>Grindle fig. 1. <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"863\">*863</page-number>The Board further found that Schnittker discloses a single-cable connector with a metal grounding ring with tangs that engage a metal-clad cable. J.A. 14-15; <em>see also </em>Schnittker col.2 11. 22-31. We see no error in these factual findings.</p>\n<p id=\"b891-5\">The Board in affirming the examiner\u2019s final rejection found it obvious to combine Grindle and Schnittker, substituting Grindle\u2019s single set screw with two grounding rings as taught by Schnittker, with one grounding ring per cable. J.A. 58. The Board reasoned that the resulting combination yielded retainers \u201csecured in each of said openings in said inbound end for accepting separate cables\u201d and thus rendered the limitation obvious. J.A. 23-35.</p>\n<p id=\"b891-6\">Arlington argues that the examiner\u2019s rejection was improper because Schnittker\u2019s grounding ring cannot be a retainer because it merely grounds a metal-clad cable rather than restricting its removal. The Board disagreed, finding that Schnittker discloses that the grounding ring has a number of tangs that, when the grommet is tightened, \u201cengage the outer surface ... of [a] metal clad cable ... to create a force which resists a rearward force that could pull the cable out of the connector....\u201d J.A. 15. This finding is supported by substantial evidence in Schnittker\u2019s disclosure. <em>See, e.g., </em>Schnittker col.5 1.66-col.6 1.2 (tangs are shaped and arranged \u201cto aid in gripping the metal clad cable----\u201d), <em>id. </em>at eol.7 11. 48-53 (grounding ring cannot move rearwardly once a gland nut is tightened to compress a grommet). Accordingly, we see no error in the Board\u2019s conclusion that the combination of Schnittker with Grindle would have included the claimed retainer.</p>\n<p id=\"b891-9\">Arlington also argues that Schnittker\u2019s grounding ring is not in the \u201copening in said inbound end.\u201d Arlington first argues that the combination results in the grounding ring being secured \u201cto\u201d the opening rather than \u201cin\u201d the opening. Arlington further argues that the grounding ring cannot be in the \u201cinbound end\u201d of the connector because the ring is placed towards the back of the connector disclosed in Schnittker. Both arguments fail, however, because Arlington focuses only on the spatial argument of components within the Schnittker-type connector separately from the Grindle-type connector. The proper focus is on the Grindle-Schnittker combination. The examiner\u2019s combination involves placing two Schnittker-type connectors on the inbound end of a Grindletype duplex connector. In that context, the connector\u2019s \u201chousing\u201d is the Grindletype duplex connector together with two of the Schnittker-type connectors, and we find no error in the Board\u2019s conclusion that the grounding rings of Schnittker are secured in the inbound end of that housing as a whole.</p>\n<p id=\"b891-11\">This court further sees no error in the Board\u2019s affirmance of the examiner\u2019s determination that substitution of Grindle\u2019s set screw with the Schnittker-type retainers merely was the substitution of one known element for another. Arlington contends that there was no motivation to combine, but the Board specifically noted that the \u201ccombination would maintain equal resistance on each inlet in a way that the single screw of Grindle could not.\u201d J.A. 31. Arlington does not attack the Board\u2019s explanation, and we see no error in it. Arlington further contends that the combination of Grindle with Schnittkertype retainers would not have been obvious because the combination of Grindle and Schnittker would require \u201csubstantial reengineering,\u201d citing <em>In re Ratti, </em>46 C.C.P.A. 976, 270 F.2d 810, 813 (1959). However, Arlington itself notes that the combination requires merely threading the parallel openings in Grindle to accept the connectors disclosed in Schnittker, Appellant\u2019s Br. 47, a modification that hardly <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"864\">*864</page-number>amounts to substantial reengineering. Arlington finally argues that the time-span between the prior art and the filing date of the '881 patent\u2019s application undermines any \u201cobvious to try\u201d inference, citing to <em>Leo Pharma. Prods., Ltd. v. Rea, </em>726 F.3d 1346 (Fed.Cir.2013). However, the Board\u2019s decision was not predicated on an \u201cobvious to try\u201d rationale and the facts are unlike those in <em>Leo. </em>Here, the art is not unpredictable and Arlington does not argue that the prior art taught away from the combination.</p>\n<p id=\"b892-5\">2. The claimed \u201ctangs\u201d</p>\n<p id=\"b892-6\">Claim 1 further requires that the retainer has tangs to \u201cguide said separate cables toward said cylindrical outbound end in a manner that said separate cables are advanced to said outbound end.\u201d Arlington contends that the combination of the prior art lacks \u201ctangs\u201d that \u201cguide\u201d and \u201cadvance! ]\u201d cables \u201ctoward\u201d the outbound end. Arlington argues that the tangs of Schnittker\u2019s grounding ring do not guide or advance the cables to the outbound end because the tangs instead merely direct the cable straight down the bore. Appellant\u2019s Br. 52. Arlington contends that the shoulders of the Grindle-Schnittker housing, and not the tangs, actually guide the cables. Arlington further argues that the tangs cannot \u201cadvance\u201d the cable because Schnittker\u2019s grounding ring is not locked into place \u2014 by tightening a gland nut and grommet \u2014 until the cable already is fully inserted. Arlington lastly repeats its argument that the tangs are not in the inbound end of the connector.</p>\n<p id=\"b892-7\">Bridgeport counters that Arlington did not propose any construction for these terms and that under the terms\u2019 broadest reasonable construction, the Board concluded correctly that \u201cthe inwardly extending tines of Schnittker\u2019s grounding ring ... incorporated into Grindle\u2019s duplex connector would function to receive, engage, and guide or permit forward movement of the metal clad cables from the inbound end through the grounding ring and towards an outbound end, in a manner commensurate with the language of independent claim 1.\u201d J.A. 25.</p>\n<p id=\"b892-9\">Arlington\u2019s arguments are not persuasive. Arlington\u2019s argument that the examiner\u2019s combination does not advance cables toward the outbound end, but only straight down the bore of the housing, assumes that the duplex connector must have an offset outbound end. However, an offset outbound end is not claimed. Moreover, even with an offset outbound end, straight down the bore still is \u201ctoward\u201d the outbound end. That the shoulders of the housing provide <em>additional </em>guidance and advancing toward the outbound end does not negate the guidance and advancing initially provided by the tangs. Further, though a cable must already be fully inserted into Schnittker\u2019s grounding ring before the ring is tightened and locked into place, the grounding ring\u2019s tangs engage the cable before that point. <em>See </em>Schnittker at col.7 11.33-37. Moreover, Arlington does not appear to have presented this particular argument to the Board in the first instance. Lastly, the argument that the tangs are not in the inbound end of the connector has been addressed and rejected above.</p>\n<p id=\"b892-10\">3. The claimed \u201ctubular spring steel adapter\u201d</p>\n<p id=\"b892-11\">Claim 1 additionally requires a \u201ctubular spring steel adapter\u201d in the outbound end of the housing. The Board found that it would have been obvious to substitute Roeder\u2019s bushing for Grindle\u2019s lock-nut and threads as an adapter for Grindle\u2019s housing, J.A. 32, and that it further would have been obvious to make the adapter out of spring steel, <em>id. </em>at 33-34. <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"865\">*865</page-number>Arlington argues that the Board failed to identify any prior art that disclosed or suggested an \u201cadapter\u201d made of spring steel and that the art relied on by the Board actually teaches away from using spring steel. Arlington contends that to the extent it did not raise this specific argument to the Board, the implications of the spring steel limitation were known at the Board and thus may be addressed here. Bridgeport counters that Arlington did not argue to the Board that the use of spring steel for the adapter would not have been obvious and that, therefore, Arlington waived the argument. Bridgeport further contends that the Board had substantial evidence on which to conclude that use of Roeder\u2019s bushing with the Grindle-Sehnittker combination merely involved the substitution of one known element for another with a predictable benefit.</p>\n<p id=\"b893-5\">Arlington argued to the Board that the combination of Roeder with Grindle was inadequate because Roeder\u2019s bushing would not establish a proper grounding mechanism and because it was not intended as a permanent connector. <em>Id. </em>The Board disagreed with Arlington, noting first that both arguments failed because they were directed to unclaimed limitations. <em>Id. </em>We agree with the Board\u2019s conclusion, as the claims recite neither a grounding mechanism nor a connector that is permanent.</p>\n<p id=\"b893-6\">Arlington did not argue to the Board that the examiner lacked evidence to support the substitution of spring steel as the material. However, Arlington contends that it preserved the issue for this court\u2019s review when it argued to the Board that Roeder did not disclose the claimed spring steel adapter\u2019s outwardly extending tangs, prompting the Board to acknowledge that Roeder\u2019s bushing was not made of spring steel. However, the examiner already had concluded that Roeder\u2019s bushing was not made of spring steel and would have to be modified, concluding that it would have been obvious \u201cto allow for continual reuse.\u201d J.A. 1208-09. Though Arlington disputed a number of aspects concerning the combination with Roeder \u2014 such as whether the resulting combination would establish a ground connection or whether Roeder was intended to be permanent\u2014 the examiner\u2019s and the Board\u2019s conclusion that it would have been obvious to make the Roeder bushing from spring steel was not one of the disputes that was raised.</p>\n<p id=\"b893-8\">Arguing against waiver, Arlington relies on <em>In re Baxter Intern., Inc., </em>678 F.3d 1357, 1362 (Fed.Cir.2012) for the proposition that no waiver exists when the appellant raised timely arguments regarding the examiner\u2019s analysis of a limitation. Here, however, Arlington did not raise any argument before the Board that the substitution of spring steel for the adapter was not obvious. Arlington similarly relies on <em>Wm. Wrigley Jr. Co. v. Cadbury Adams USA LLC, </em>683 F.3d 1356, 1360-61 n. 3 (Fed.Cir.2012) for the proposition that presenting the \u201cessence of its present arguments\u201d to the Board is sufficient to preserve the issue. Here, however, Arlington\u2019s arguments regarding the adapter limitation were not, in essence, that it would not have been obvious to make the adapter of spring steel. Arlington argued that the Board\u2019s combination lacked proper grounding and was not a permanent connector. The Board concluded that these were unclaimed limitations and further that the use of spring steel would resolve those issues in any event. Arlington did not argue that spring steel would not have been obvious to use in the first instance. Lastly, Arlington relies on <em>Warner-Lambert Co. v. Teva Pharmaceuticals USA, Inc., </em>418 F.3d 1326, 1338 n. 1 (Fed. Cir.2005) for the proposition that it is sufficient to raise the general legal issue below. However, the legal principle from <em>Warner-</em><page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"866\">*866</page-number><em>Lambert </em>is that \u201cthis court does not review supporting arguments, but only the decisions reached by the trial court.\u201d <em>Interactive Gift Express, Inc. v. Compuserve, Inc., </em>256 F.3d 1323, 1346 (Fed.Cir.2001) (citing <em>Stratoflex, Inc. v. Aeroquip Corp., </em>713 F.2d 1530, 1540 (Fed.Cir.1983)). The examiner concluded that it would have been obvious to make the adapter out of spring steel to allow for continuous reuse. J.A. 1208-09. Rather than disputing that decision, Arlington instead disputed whether the Roeder adapter would provide proper grounding or permanence. Unsurprisingly, the Board did not further discuss the obviousness of spring steel because its decision was not challenged. We \u201cgenerally do not consider arguments that the applicant failed to present to the Board\u201d and see no exceptional circumstances here requiring otherwise. <em>Baxter, </em>678 F.3d at 1362.</p>\n<p id=\"b894-4\">In any event, the references before the Board provide substantial evidence to support the substitution of spring steel. Schnittker\u2019s grounding ring indisputably is spring steel and was known to be used with the heavier metal-clad cables. Accordingly, the record does provide substantial evidence to support its finding that a person of ordinary skill in the art would have known of spring steel\u2019s grounding properties and its suitability for working with metal-clad cables.</p>\n<p id=\"b894-5\">Arlington further contends that Roeder actually teaches away from the claimed invention. Here, Arlington argues that Roeder teaches away because as disclosed, the Roeder adapter was too weak to function with metal clad cables. Appellant\u2019s Br. 60-61. Arlington is referring to the Board\u2019s finding that it would have been obvious to use spring steel for the adapter \u201cto allow for continual reuse to address the increase in weight\u201d from the metal-clad cables. J.A. 34. However, the Board did not conclude that the combination would not function with metal clad cables (only that modification would be needed for continual reuse), and Arlington presents no evidence that the combination would in fact be nonfunctional. Thus, because substantial evidence supports the Board\u2019s conclusion that the combination was at least functional, Arlington misplaces its reliance on <em>In re Gordon, </em>733 F.2d 900, 902 (Fed. Cir.1984) (\u201cIf references taken in combination would produce a \u2018seemingly inoperative device,\u2019 ... such references teach away from the combination and thus cannot serve as predicates for a prima facie case of obviousness.\u201d).</p>\n<p id=\"b894-7\">4. Secondary Considerations</p>\n<p id=\"b894-8\">Arlington offered evidence of commercial success and of a long-felt but unresolved need. The Board rejected both forms of evidence for lack of a demonstrated nexus to the claimed invention. Arlington argues that this was error. Arlington contends that its connectors embody the claimed inventions, sell in large numbers, and sell at a premium to non-embodying connectors. Arlington further argues that it was not required to present evidence of market share because Arlington and Bridgeport are the only participants in the relevant market, Bridgeport did not produce its sales figures, and a district court already concluded that each infringing Bridgeport sale was likely a lost Arlington sale. Bridgeport contends that the Board correctly determined that Arlington\u2019s evidence did not establish commercial success because there was insufficient evidence of Arlington\u2019s market share.</p>\n<p id=\"b894-9\">Arlington\u2019s evidence of commercial success included sales figures of its SNAP2 IT\u00ae (\u201cSNAP2IT\u00ae\u201d) connectors. Arlington argues that these connectors embody the claimed inventions and that the sales figures demonstrate the invention\u2019s com<page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"867\">*867</page-number>mercial success. To demonstrate that the SNAP2IT connectors embody the claims, Arlington submitted to the Board a claim chart in which Arlington\u2019s expert charted the limitations of the '831 patent\u2019s claims to the SNAP2 IT products. Arlington contends that this established a <em>prima facie </em>case of a nexus between SNAP2IT\u2019s commercial success and the claimed invention, citing <em>Crocs, Inc. v. Int\u2019l Trade Com\u2019n, </em>598 F.3d 1294, 1311 (Fed.Cir.2010) (citing <em>In re GPAC Inc., </em>57 F.3d 1573, 1580 (Fed.Cir.1995)). Arlington then concludes that because conventional duplex connectors sell for, on average, 75% less per unit than similarly insulated SNAP 2IT connectors, Arlington\u2019s SNAP 2IT sales figures demonstrate the success of the claimed invention. Appellant\u2019s Br. 72.</p>\n<p id=\"b895-5\">The Board found Arlington\u2019s showing to fall short in part because the sales figures demonstrated that 96% of the SNAP2IT sales were for duplex connectors with an unclaimed feature: an insulated throat design. Without any ability to assess the overall market, the Board did not err when it concluded that it was unable to gauge whether the SNAP 2IT sales actually constituted commercial success or any meaningful share of the duplex connector market. Arlington contends that Bridgeport is the only other participant in the relevant market and that because Bridgeport did not produce its sales figures, it could not provide the evidence in question. However, the relevant market is for duplex connectors in general, not solely Bridgeport\u2019s connectors. Arlington never offered evidence of the entire market for insulated-throat duplex connectors or uninsulated-throat duplex connectors relevant to the remaining 4% of the SNAP 2IT sales. Arlington argues that it did not need to provide that evidence because a district court concluded that every Bridgeport Whipper-Snap duplex connector sold was a lost sale of Arlington\u2019s SNAP 2IT connector. That finding also is insufficient because it does not establish that either product is a commercially successful duplex connector in the context of the overall market of duplex connectors.</p>\n<p id=\"b895-7\">Arlington did submit customer declarations and publications praising the SNAP 2 IT connectors, but the Board discounted their weight, finding the declarant\u2019s statements vague and otherwise unpersuasive. Because the Board\u2019s assessment of secondary considerations is supported by substantial evidence, we have no reason to upset it.</p>\n<p id=\"b895-8\">For the foregoing reasons, we affirm the Board\u2019s decision on obviousness as to claims 1, 5 and 6.</p>\n<p id=\"b895-9\">B. Bridgeport\u2019s Cross Appeal</p>\n<p id=\"b895-10\">Bridgeport cross appeals the Board\u2019s decision concerning the priority date of claim 1 and the Board\u2019s affirmance of the patentability of claim 3. The cross appeal concerning claim l\u2019s priority date implicates not only the patentability of claim 1, but also of claim 4, which depends from claim 1 and was found to be patentable based on claim l\u2019s priority date.</p>\n<p id=\"b895-11\">The '831 patent issued from Pat. Appl. No. 09/941,341 (\u201cthe '341 application\u201d), filed on August 29, 2001. That application is a continuation-in-part of U.S. Pat.App. No. 09/792,185 ('185 application), filed on February 23, 2001, which is a continuation-in-part of U.S. Pat.App. No. 09/373,427 (\u201c'427 application\u201d), filed on August 13, 1999. The examiner and the Board found that claim 1 was entitled to the August 13, 1999 date of the '427 application. Like the '341 application, the '185 and '427 applications describe a duplex connector with an oval-shaped inbound end with a large, single cavity and an insert plugging that cavity to divide it into a pair of parallel openings. However, the '341 application <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"868\">*868</page-number>includes, for the first time, a discussion of a housing that does not use this insert, instead having an inbound end with an integrally-formed pair of openings. '881 Patent col.2 11. 42-48.</p>\n<p id=\"b896-4\">Bridgeport argues that claim 1 of the '831 patent is entitled only to the August 29, 2001 date of the '341 application. Bridgeport\u2019s argument centers on the '831 patent\u2019s description of an insert as distinct from the connector\u2019s housing. <em>See, e.g., </em>'831 patent col.l 11. 52-53 (\u201c[t]he inbound end of the housing is adapted to accept an insert containing\u201d the two openings), col.2 11. 6-9 (\u201cThe duplex connector of the present invention could be made even simpler by modifying the inbound end of the connector housing to hold the cable retainers. Modified in this manner, the insert could be eliminated____\u201d). Because the '831 patent\u2019s claim 1 requires that the pair of parallel openings be in the \u201chousing,\u201d Bridgeport contends that the claim cannot encompass a connector that uses an insert to define the openings. And because the '341 application was the first to discuss a housing that does not use an insert, Bridgeport argues that therefore claim l\u2019s priority date only can be August 29, 2001. Arlington counters that substantial evidence supports the Board\u2019s conclusion that claim 1 is entitled to the August 13, 1999 priority date because nothing in the relevant disclosures or the claim would limit the openings to exist only as part of an insert.</p>\n<p id=\"b896-7\">The examiner and the Board concluded that in light of Figures 1 and 2 of the '427 application \u2014 which illustrate a connector with a pair of openings in an insert \u2014 a person of ordinary skill in the art would have understood the inventors to possess a duplex connector with a pair of parallel openings in the inbound end of the housing and that claim 1 is not limited to having openings only defined within an insert. J.A. 46-47. We find no error in that decision. In reexamination, the claims must be given their broadest reasonable interpretation. <em>In re Trans Texas Holdings, Corp., </em>498 F.3d 1290, 1298 (Fed.Cir.2007) (quoting <em>In re Yamamoto, </em>740 F.2d 1569, 1571 (Fed.Cir.1984)). Under that standard, the claim merely requires that the inbound end of the housing be generally oval and have a pair of openings. No aspect of the claims requires the housing, much less the inbound end of the housing, to have a unitary structure. Thus, an insert is not excluded by the claim. Indeed, claim 3 depends from claim 1 and further adds that the pair of parallel openings is included in an insert secured within the inbound end of the housing. '831 patent col.711. 23-26.</p>\n<p id=\"b896-9\">Bridgeport does, however, accurately identify error in the Board\u2019s handling of claim 3. The examiner concluded that claim 3 was entitled only to the August 29, 2001 filing date because the claim requires that the walls of the insert include an annular ridge, and none of the parent applications supported a disclosure of that annular ridge. J.A. 2126. Arlington did not dispute this finding. J.A. 1204. Thus, the examiner considered Bridgeport\u2019s asserted prior art on the merits but found that it did not establish unpatentability. J.A. 1218. The Board affirmed but did so on the basis that Bridgeport\u2019s asserted prior art did not antedate the August 13, 1999 priority date of claim 1. J.A. 48. This was error because the examiner found, without dispute from either party, that claim 3 was entitled only to the later August 29, 2001 priority date.</p>\n<p id=\"b896-10\">Arlington urges this court to affirm the patentability of claim 3 as being unobvious, but the Board did not pass on that issue and we decline to consider it in the first instance. <em>See SEC v. Chenery Corp., </em>332 U.S. 194, 196, 67 S.Ct. 1575, 91 L.Ed. 1995 (1947). Because the Board relied on erroneous grounds, we vacate the decision as <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"869\">*869</page-number>to claim 3 and remand for further proceedings.</p>\n<p id=\"b897-5\">IV. Conclusion</p>\n<p id=\"b897-6\">For the reasons discussed above, the Board\u2019s decision is affirmed with respect to claims 1, 4, 5 and 6. The Board\u2019s decision is vacated with respect to claim 3, and the case is remanded so that the Board may consider the patentability of that claim in view of the appropriate priority date.</p>\n<p id=\"b897-7\">AFFIRMED-IN-PART, VACATED-IN-PART, AND REMANDED.</p>\n<p id=\"b897-8\">Costs</p>\n<p id=\"b897-9\">Costs to Bridgeport.</p>\n</opinion>\n</casebody>\n",
