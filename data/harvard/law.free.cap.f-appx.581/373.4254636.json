Taylor, federal prisoner # 31212-034, appeals the denial of his 18 U.S.C. \u00a7 3582(c)(2) motion for reduction of sentence and 28 U.S.C. \u00a7 2255 motion to vacate sentence. Taylor pleaded guilty to conspiracy to distribute and possess with intent to distribute five grams or more of cocaine base and distribution of five grams or more of cocaine base, in violation of 21 U.S.C. \u00a7\u00a7 841(a)(1) and (b)(1)(B) and 846. He was sentenced to 156 months of imprisonment and eight years of supervised release.</p>\n<p id=\"b402-10\">We lack jurisdiction to consider Taylor\u2019s appeal of the denial of his \u00a7 2255 motion since he failed to file a timely notice of appeal. <em>See Bowles v. Russell, </em>551 U.S. 205, 208-14, 127 S.Ct. 2360, 168 L.Ed.2d 96 (2007). We will consider Taylor\u2019s untimely appeal of the denial of his \u00a7 3582(c)(2) motion since the Government has waived the non-jurisdietional requirement of a timely notice of appeal. <em>See United States v. Martinez, </em>496 F.3d 387, 388 (5th Cir. 2007).</p>\n<p id=\"b402-11\">Section 3582(c)(2) permits the modification of a defendant\u2019s sentence where his guidelines range has .been subsequently lowered by the Sentencing Commission. \u00a7 3582(c)(2); U.S.S.G. \u00a7 lB1.10(a)(2)(B). Ordinarily, we review the district court\u2019s decision whether to reduce a sentence pursuant to \u00a7 3582(c)(2) for abuse of discretion. <em>United States v. Evans, </em>587 F.3d 667, 672 (5th Cir.2009). Taylor contends that he is eligible for a sentence reduction under Amendment 750 to the Sentencing Guidelines, which implemented the Fair Sentencing Act of 2010 (FSA) and revised the Guidelines applicable to offenses involving cocaine base. Taylor did not raise this issue in his \u00a7 3582(c)(2) motion; thus, review is for plain error. <em>See United States v. Jones, </em>596 F.3d 273, 276 (5th Cir .2010).</p>\n<p id=\"b402-16\">In Amendment 750, the Sentencing Commission amended the base offense levels for cocaine base in the drug quantity tables of U.S.S.G. \u00a7 2Dl.l(c) to conform to the FSA. U.S. Sentencing Guidelines Manual app. C., vol. Ill, amend. 750, pt. C, pp. 392-94. Taylor\u2019s guidelines range was not based on the quantity of cocaine base pursuant to \u00a7 2Dl.l(c); his guidelines range was based on his status as a career offender pursuant to U.S.S.G. \u00a7 4B1.1. Contrary to Taylor\u2019s argument, his sentence was still based on the career offender Guideline even though the district court departed below the guidelines range. Accordingly, he was not sentenced based on a sentencing range that was subsequently lowered by the Sentencing Commission. <em>See United States v. Anderson, </em>591 F.3d 789, 791 (5th Cir.2009). As to Taylor\u2019s challenge to the adequacy of the district court\u2019s reasons for imposing sentence and its consideration of the 18 U.S.C. \u00a7 3553(a) factors, a \u00a7 3582(c)(2) motion may not be used to challenge the correctness of the defendant\u2019s original sentence, as Taylor at<page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"375\">*375</page-number>tempts to do here. <em>See Dillon v. United States, </em>560 U.S. 817, 831, 130 S.Ct. 2683, 177 L.Ed.2d 271 (2010). There was no error, plain or otherwise in the district court\u2019s denial of Taylor\u2019s \u00a7 3582(c)(2) motion.</p>\n<p id=\"b403-5\">The judgment of the district court is AFFIRMED.</p>\n<footnote label=\"*\">\n<p id=\"b402-12\"> Pursuant to 5th Cir. R. 47.5, the court has determined that this opinion should not be published and is not precedent except under the limited circumstances set forth in 5th Cir. R. 47.5.4.</p>\n</footnote>\n</opinion>\n</casebody>\n",
