Henry asserts that the BIA erred in denying his request to reopen his removal proceedings for withholding of removal under CAT based on changed country conditions. The Government contends that this court lacks jurisdiction to review the petition.</p>\n<p id=\"b406-4\">Henry\u2019s removal results from his conviction of an aggravated felony. Henry does not dispute that he was convicted of an aggravated felony. Due to Henry\u2019s aggravated felony conviction, our review is limited by statute to constitutional or legal claims. <em>See Siwe v. Holder, </em>742 F.3d 603, 607 (5th Cir.2014); 8 U.S.C. \u00a7 1252(a)(2)(C) &amp; (D). In this context, we do not have jurisdiction to review factual determinations made by the BIA. <em>See Escudero-Arciniega v. Holder, </em>702 F.3d 781, 785 (5th Cir.2012). Thus in <em>Escudero-Arciniega, </em>we dismissed for lack of jurisdiction an aggravated felon\u2019s petition for review of a denial of CAT relief where the challenge was based on fact issues. <em>Id. </em>In contrast, we refused to dismiss for lack of jurisdiction an aggravated felon\u2019s petition for review of denial of CAT relief where the challenge was based \u201con three carefully framed and discrete legal questions.\u201d <em>Sealed Petitioner v. Sealed Respondent, </em>No. 13-60157, 567 F.3d 231, 233-35, 2014 WL 1814211, at *2-3 (5th Cir. May 6, 2014) (unpublished). In this case, after reviewing Henry\u2019s brief, we are persuaded that Henry is challenging the BIA\u2019s factual determinations. And since we \u201cwould not have had the authority to review a direct petition,\u201d Henry \u201ccannot manufacture jurisdiction simply by petitioning this court to review the BIA\u2019s denial of his motion to reopen.\u201d <em>See Assaad v. Ashcroft, </em>378 F.3d 471, 475 (5th Cir.2004).</p>\n<p id=\"b406-9\">Accordingly, Henry\u2019s petition for review is DISMISSED for lack of jurisdiction.</p>\n<footnote label=\"*\">\n<p id=\"b405-7\"> Pursuant to 5th Cir. R. 47.5, the court has determined that this opinion should not be <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"378\">*378</page-number>published and is not precedent except under the limited circumstances set forth in 5th Cir. R. 47.5.4.</p>\n</footnote>\n</opinion>\n</casebody>\n",
