His sole issue on appeal is that he was deprived of a fair trial because his counsel was ineffective.</p>\n<p id=\"b480-17\">As Ledezma acknowledges, the general rule is that ineffective-assistance claims cannot be resolved on direct appeal unless the issue has first been raised before the district court. <em>See United States v. Haese, </em>162 F.3d 359, 363 (5th Cir.1998). Ineffective assistance was not raised in the district court, and the record is not sufficiently developed for us to deviate from the general rule. The judgment is AFFIRMED.</p>\n<footnote label=\"*\">\n<p id=\"b480-18\"> Pursuant to 5th Cir. R. 47.5, the court has determined that this opinion should not be published and is not precedent except under the limited circumstances set forth in 5th Cir. R. 47.5.4.</p>\n</footnote>\n</opinion>\n</casebody>\n",
