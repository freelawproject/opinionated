Apfel, </em>185 F.3d 1211, 1213 (11th Cir.1999). We review the Commissioner\u2019s factual findings with deference and legal conclusions with close scrutiny. <em>Doughty v. Apfel, </em>245 F.3d 1274, 1278 (11th Cir.2001). Substantial evidence is such relevant evidence as a reasonable mind might accept as adequate to support a conclusion. <em>Id. </em>When the Appeals Council denies review, we review the Administrative Law Judge\u2019s (\u201cALJ\u201d) decision as the Commissioner\u2019s final decision. <em>Id. </em>We do not address arguments not raised before the district court. <em>Crawford v. Comm\u2019r of Soc. Sec., </em>363 F.3d 1155, 1161 (11th Cir.2004).</p>\n<p id=\"b839-19\">In order to be eligible for SSI, an individual living with a spouse must not have resources of more than $3,000. 20 C.F.R. \u00a7 416.1205(b), (c). \u201cResources\u201d are defined as \u201ccash or other liquid assets or any real or personal property that an individual (or spouse, if any) owns and could convert to cash to be used for his or her support and maintenance.\u201d <em>Id. </em>\u00a7 416.1201(a). Liquid resources are defined as \u201ccash or other property which can be converted to cash within 20 days,\u201d such as \u201cfinancial institution accounts.\u201d <em>Id. </em>\u00a7 416.1201(b). Funds held in a financial institution account are an individual\u2019s resource if the individual owns the account and can use the funds for his or her support and maintenance. <em>Id. </em>\u00a7 416.1208(a). An individual\u2019s principal place of residence and one automobile used for transportation <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"812\">*812</page-number>are not counted as resources. <em>Id. </em>\u00a7 \u00a7 416.1210(a), (c), 416.1212(a).</p>\n<p id=\"b840-4\">The proceeds of a loan do not count as income for the purposes of SSI eligibility. <em>Id. </em>\u00a7 416.1103(f). However, according to the SSA\u2019s internal-guidance manual, Programs Operations Manual System (\u201cPOMS\u201d), cash provided by a lender upon a borrower\u2019s promise to repay in full counts as the borrower\u2019s resource if retained in the month following the month of receipt. POMS SI 01120.220(B)(1), (C)(1)(a). We have stated that \u201c[w]hile the POMS does not have the force of law, it can be persuasive.\u201d <em>Stroup v. Barnhart, </em>327 F.3d 1258, 1262 (11th Cir.2003).</p>\n<p id=\"b840-5\">The Commissioner shall recover over-payments to an individual whenever the Commissioner finds that more or less than the correct amount of benefits has been paid. 42 U.S.C. \u00a7 1383(b)(1)(A). Recovery of an overpayment may be waived if a claimant is without fault and recovery would defeat the purpose of Title XVI, would be against equity or good conscience, or would impede efficient or effective administration of Title XVI due to the small amount involved. 20 C.F.R. \u00a7 416.550. The claimant has the burden of establishing that he is without fault for the overpayment. <em>Viehman v. Schweiker, </em>679 F.2d 223, 227 (11th Cir.1982). \u201cAlthough the finding depends on all of the circumstances in the particular case, an individual will be found to have been at fault in connection with an overpayment when an incorrect payment resulted from ... failure to furnish information which the individual knew or should have known was material.\u201d 20 C.F.R. \u00a7 416.552(a).</p>\n<p id=\"b840-6\">Here, the funds in Kosloffs financial institution accounts were properly counted as resources. 20 C.F.R. \u00a7 416.1201(a), (b). Kosloff himself described his HELOC as a loan, and loan proceeds are counted as a resource the month after their receipt. POMS SI 01120.220(C)(1)(a). Kosloffs argument that equity in a home is not a countable resource if the home is the individual\u2019s principal residence fails because his equity was not actually counted as a resource \u2014 the proceeds of a line of credit secured by that equity were. Additionally, substantial evidence supports the ALJ\u2019s conclusion that Kosloff was overpaid $1,178.38 in SSI benefits from March to September 2010, <em>Kelley, </em>185 F.3d at 1213, and Kosloff did not argue below that he was not at fault as to the overpayments, so we need not address that issue, <em>Crawford, </em>363 F.3d at 1161.</p>\n<p id=\"b840-8\">After careful review of the parties\u2019 briefs and the record on appeal, we affirm for the foregoing reasons.</p>\n<p id=\"b840-9\">AFFIRMED.</p>\n<footnote label=\"1\">\n<p id=\"b839-16\">.
