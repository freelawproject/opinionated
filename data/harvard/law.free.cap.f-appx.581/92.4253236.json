Mulligan, denying his motion to reopen. <em>In re Sohg Bo, </em>No. A077 736 280 (B.I.A. July 5, 2013), <em>aff'g </em>No. A077 736 280 (Immig. Ct. N.Y. City Jan. 31, 2012). We assume the parties\u2019 familiarity with the underlying facts and procedural history of this case. Under the circumstances of this case, we have reviewed both the IJ\u2019s and the BIA\u2019s opinions \u201cfor the sake of completeness.\u201d Zaman <em>v. Mukasey, </em>514 F.3d 233, 237 (2d Cir.2008) (quotation marks and citations omitted). The applicable standards of review are well established. <em>See Jian Hui Shao v. Mukasey, </em>546 F.3d 138, 168-69 (2d Cir.2008).</p>\n<p id=\"b120-19\">Under the circumstances of this case, we have reviewed both the IJ\u2019s and the BIA\u2019s opinions \u201cfor the sake of completeness.\u201d <em>Zaman v.

Mukasey, </em>546 F.3d 138, 168-69 (2d Cir.2008).</p>\n<p id=\"b120-20\">Bo filed a motion to reopen based on his claim that he fears forced sterilization in his home province of Zhejiang because he has had more than one child in violation of China\u2019s population control program. We find no error in the agency\u2019s determinations that Bo failed to demonstrate either <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"93\">*93</page-number>materially changed country conditions excusing the untimely and number-barred filing of his motion or his <em>prima facie </em>eligibility for asylum or related relief. <em>See id. </em>at 158-72.</p>\n<p id=\"b121-5\">For the foregoing reasons, the petition for review is DENIED. As we have completed our review, any stay of removal that the Court previously granted in this petition is VACATED, and any pending motion for a stay of removal in this petition is DISMISSED as moot. Any pending request for oral argument in this petition is DENIED in accordance with Federal Rule of Appellate Procedure 34(a)(2), and Second Circuit Local Rule 34.1(b).</p>\n</opinion>\n</casebody>\n",
