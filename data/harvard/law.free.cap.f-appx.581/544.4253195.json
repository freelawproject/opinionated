After the Social Security Administration denied the application, Bowen requested a hearing before an administrative law judge <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"545\">*545</page-number>(ALJ). The ALJ denied Bowen relief, and the Appeals Council declined to review the case. The' district court affirmed the denial of Bowen\u2019s application.</p>\n<p id=\"b573-5\">On appeal, Bowen raises three arguments: (1) the ALJ erred by discounting the medical opinion of her treating physician; (2) the ALJ erred by concluding that her testimony was not fully credible; and (B) the ALJ erred by concluding that she retained the residual functional capacity (RFC) to perform light work. \u201cOur review of the ALJ\u2019s decision is limited to whether the ALJ applied the correct legal standards and whether the findings of the ALJ are supported by substantial evidence.\u201d <em>Blakley v. Comm\u2019r of Soc. Sec., </em>581 F.3d 399, 405 (6th Cir.2009). \u201cThe substantial-evidence standard is met if a reasonable mind might accept the relevant evidence as adequate to support a conclusion.\u201d <em>Id. </em>at 406 (internal quotation marks omitted). \u201cWe give de novo review to the district court\u2019s conclusions on each issue.\u201d <em>Id.</em></p>\n<p id=\"b573-6\">Bowen first argues that the ALJ erred by discounting the medical opinion of her treating physician, Dr. Denise Dingle, that Bowen had significant work-related physical impairments. A medical opinion from a treating source must be given controlling weight if it is well-supported by medically acceptable clinical and laboratory diagnostic techniques and not inconsistent with other substantial evidence in the record. <em>Gayheart v. Comm\u2019r of Soc. Sec., </em>710 F.3d 365, 376 (6th Cir.2013). If not given controlling weight, the ALJ must weigh the treating source\u2019s opinion based on the nature of the treatment relationship, the specialization of the medical source, and the consistency and supportability of the opinion. <em>Id.</em></p>\n<p id=\"b573-7\">Substantial evidence supported the ALJ\u2019s decision to discount Dr. Dingle\u2019s medical opinion. Dingle made her assessment of Bowen\u2019s physical limitations nearly two years after the period relevant to the disability determination, and she failed to specifically identify when the alleged limitations began and the extent to which the limitations were present during the relevant period. In addition, Dingle\u2019s conclusion that Bowen had significant physical limitations conflicted with her treatment notes and the other medical evidence in the record, which generally demonstrated that Bowen\u2019s physical condition was stable and that she was not suffering from debilitating physical impairments.</p>\n<p id=\"b573-9\">Bowen next argues that the ALJ erred by concluding that her testimony concerning the extent of her impairments was not fully credible. We accord great weight and deference to an ALJ\u2019s credibility finding, but such a finding must be supported by substantial evidence. <em>Walters v. Comm\u2019r of Soc. Sec., </em>127 F.3d 525, 531 (6th Cir.1997). The ALJ could reasonably discount Bowen\u2019s testimony that she had severe physical impairments, given the lack of supporting medical evidence, the evidence that she engaged in significant activities of daily living, and the fact that she refused to comply with the advice of her physician to wear a compression garment as an important part of her treatment. Thus, the ALJ\u2019s credibility determination was supported by substantial evidence.</p>\n<p id=\"b573-10\">Finally, Bowen argues that the ALJ erred by concluding that she retained the exertional capacity to perform light work. Given that Bowen performed light or medium work until the alleged onset date of disability and that there is no credible medical evidence or testimony showing that she subsequently developed limitations precluding light work, substantial evidence supported the ALJ\u2019s RFC determination.</p>\n<p id=\"b574-3\"><page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"546\">*546</page-number>Accordingly, we affirm the district court\u2019s judgment.</p>\n</opinion>\n</casebody>\n",
