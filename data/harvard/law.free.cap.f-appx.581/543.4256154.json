After default and foreclosure on the home, the foreclosing creditor assigned its interest in the property to the Federal National Mortgage Association (\u201cFannie Mae\u201d), which by that time had been placed into conservatorship by the Federal Housing Finance Agency (\u201cFHFA\u201d). Fannie Mae then brought an action to evict the daughter from the residence. In response, Heibel, Krywicki, and their daughter initiated a separate state court action against Fannie Mae and its predecessors in interest, alleging violation of their constitutional due process rights. After defendants removed and FHFA intervened as conservator, the district court held that Fannie Mae was not a government entity subject to such a constitutional limitation and dismissed the due process claim. Heibel and her family ask us to review that decision, and whether Fannie Mae is a government actor presents the sole question in this appeal.</p>\n<p id=\"b572-6\">We have recently answered that exact question in the negative, fully cognizant of FHFA\u2019s conservatorship. <em>See Rubin v. Fannie Mae, </em>No. 13-1010, \u2014 F.3d-, ---, 2014 WL 4800282, at *1-2 (6th Cir. Sept.29, 2014); <em>Bernard v. Fed. Nat\u2019l Mortg. Ass\u2019n, </em>No. 13-1477, \u2014 F.3d -, -, 2014 WL 4800123, at *4 (6th Cir. Sept.29, 2014). We have similarly rejected arguments that Fannie Mae\u2019s twin, Freddie Mac, is a government actor for the purpose of constitutional claims. <em>See Fed. Home Loan Mortg. Corp. v. Gaines, </em>No. 13-1249, - F.3d -,---, 2014 WL 4815274, at *1-2 (6th Cir. Sept.30, 2014); <em>Mik v. Fed. Home Loan Mortg. Corp., </em>743 F.3d 149, 168 (6th Cir. 2014). Given the full reasoning of those cases, no more explanation is necessary here. We agree with the holding of the district court and affirm its judgment.</p>\n</opinion>\n</casebody>\n",
