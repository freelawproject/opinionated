We have jurisdiction under 8 U.S.C. \u00a7 1252. We review for substantial evidence the agency\u2019s factual findings. <em>Blandino-Medina v. Holder, </em>712 F.3d 1338, 1348 (9th Cir.2013). We deny the petition for review.</p>\n<p id=\"b688-22\">Substantial evidence supports the BIA\u2019s conclusion that Davila failed to demonstrate it was more likely than not he would be subjected to torture if returned to Nicaragua. <em>See id. </em>(upholding denial of CAT relief where petitioner presented a series of worst-case scenarios rather than presenting hard evidence of a clear probability of torture based on family\u2019s previous association with the Somoza regime); <em>see also Robleto-Pastora v. Holder, </em>591 F.3d 1051, 1058 (9th Cir.2010) (affirming denial of CAT relief where petitioner presented \u201cno evidence\u201d of a likelihood of torture in Nicaragua.). We reject Davila\u2019s attempts to distinguish <em>Blandino-Medina </em>and <em>Robleto-Pastora, </em>and we reject his contention that the BIA failed to consider his and his mother\u2019s testimony.</p>\n<p id=\"b688-23\">PETITION FOR REVIEW DENIED.</p>\n<footnote label=\"**\">\n<p id=\"b688-25\"> This disposition is not appropriate for publication and is not precedent except as provided by 9th Cir.
