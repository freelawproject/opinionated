In Appeal No. 13-50191, we remand. We dismiss Appeal No. 13-50271 for lack of appellate jurisdiction.</p>\n<p id=\"b691-24\">In Appeal No. 13-50191, Fabricant contends that the district court erred when it refused to file his application for DNA testing on the ground that the case was closed. We agree. As the government concedes, section 3600 provides a post-conviction remedy. <em>See </em>18 U.S.C. \u00a7 3600(a). Despite the government\u2019s request that we nevertheless affirm because the application fails on its face, we instead remand to the district court with instructions to file the application and consider it on the merits in the first instance.</p>\n<p id=\"b691-25\">In Appeal No. 13-50271, Fabricant challenges the district court\u2019s order denying his ex parte request for discovery. We dismiss the appeal for lack of appellate jurisdiction. <em>See Admiral Ins. Co. v. U.S. Dist. Ct., </em>881 F.2d 1486, 1490 (9th Cir. 1989) (discovery orders are not final appealable orders under 28 U.S.C. \u00a7 1291).</p>\n<p id=\"b691-26\">Appeal No. 13-50191 REMANDED with instructions; Appeal No. 13-50271 DISMISSED.</p>\n<footnote label=\"**\">\n<p id=\"b691-28\"> This disposition is not appropriate for publication and is not precedent except as provided by 9th Cir.
