For the reasons set out below, we AFFIRM.<footnotemark>1</footnotemark></p>\n<p id=\"b394-19\">We review the district court\u2019s grant of the defendants\u2019 motion to dismiss under Rule 12(b)(6) de novo, \u201caccept[ing] \u2018all well-pleaded facts as true, -viewing them in the light most favorable to the plaintiff.\u2019 \u201d <footnotemark>2</footnotemark> \u201cThus, the court should not dismiss [a] <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"367\">*367</page-number>claim unless the plaintiff would not be entitled to relief under any set of facts or any possible theory that [it] could prove consistent with the allegations in the complaint.\u201d<footnotemark>3</footnotemark> The well-pleaded facts in Griffin\u2019s amended complaint are as follows:</p>\n<p id=\"A1h\">On May 31, 2011, Griffin was in an automobile accident with a third party, who was at fault. Griffin sustained personal injuries and entered into settlement negotiations with the third party\u2019s insurer, Alfa, with Welch acting as Alfa\u2019s adjuster. In connection with the settlement negotiations, Griffin supplied medical information to Welch. The claim settled on July 18, 2011.</p>\n<p id=\"b395-5\">Sometime in September or October of 2011, Welch disclosed the medical information that Griffin had supplied during the now completed settlement negotiations to a third party in a willful, knowing, or grossly negligent manner. Based on this disclosure, Griffin brought this action, asserting a federal claim under a single provision of the FCRA, 15 U.S.C. \u00a7 1681b(g)(4) (titled \u201cLimitation on redisclosure of medical information\u201d), as well as state law claims. Section 1681b(g)(4) provides:</p>\n<blockquote id=\"b395-6\">(4) Limitation on redisclosure of medical information Any person that receives medical information pursuant to paragraph (1) or (3) shall not disclose such information to any other person, except as necessary to carry out the purpose for which the information was initially disclosed, or as otherwise permitted by statute, regulation, or order.</blockquote>\n<p id=\"b395-11\">The defendants filed a motion to dismiss under Rule 12(b)(6) arguing that section 1681b(g)(4) does not apply to all potential medical information, only medical information which is provided in connection with a \u201cconsumer report\u201d as defined under the FCRA. Because, the medical information here was not provided in connection with a consumer report (and Griffin has never even claimed it was), the defendants argued that Griffin failed to state a claim under the FRCA. Griffin filed a cross-motion for partial summary judgment arguing that section 1681b(g)(4)\u2019s scope was broad enough to include the medical information Welch disclosed.</p>\n<p id=\"b395-12\">In a well-reasoned memorandum opinion and order,<footnotemark>4</footnotemark> the district court concluded that Griffin failed to state a claim under section 1681b(g)(4). As the district court noted, the statutory provisions relevant to the analysis come from two sections of the FCRA, 15 U.S.C. \u00a7\u00a7 1681a and 1681b, and courts construe them together. \u201cUnder the foregoing statutory scheme, section 1681b has two functions:' it adds to section 1681a(d)\u2019s definition of a consumer report, as well as delineates the permissible uses for those \u2018communications of information\u2019 already falling within the definition of a \u2018consumer report.\u2019\u201d<footnotemark>5</footnotemark> \u201c[T]he courts have recognized the preeminence of \u00a7 1681a and conformed the breadth of \u00a7 1681b to its bounds.\u201d<footnotemark>6</footnotemark> \u201c \u2018Not to do this would render unnecessarily meaningless the \u00a7 1681a restrictive language ...\u2019 while \u2018[conforming \u00a7 1681b to 1681a preserves the integri<page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"368\">*368</page-number>ty of both sections, while promoting the underlying purpose of the entire subchapter.\u2019 \u201d<footnotemark>7</footnotemark></p>\n<p id=\"b396-4\">In short, the district court concluded that Griffin failed to construe section 1681b(g)(4) in light of the FCRA framework as a whole and failed to supply any authority for his expansive reading of the term \u201cmedical information.\u201d On its face, section 1681b(g)(4) applies only to the receipt of information pursuant to section 1681b(g)(l) or (3), and Griffin\u2019s claim falls under neither provision. First, section 1681b(g)(l) applies to the sharing of \u201ca consumer report that contains medical information\u201d by a \u201cconsumer reporting agency,\u201d but the defendants indisputably are not consumer reporting agencies, so that provision cannot apply.</p>\n<p id=\"b396-5\">Second, section 1681b(g)(3) provides,. \u201cSection 1681a(d)(3) of this title shall not be construed so as to treat information or any communication of information as a consumer report if the information or communication is disclosed\u201d under certain circumstances. Thus, the district court noted, \u201cIn order for a person to have received medical information pursuant to [section 1681a(d)(3) ], the medical information must meet the general definition of \u2018consumer report,\u2019 and it must have been shared between affiliates.\u201d<footnotemark>8</footnotemark> The medical information here does not qualify as a \u201cconsumer report,\u201d and it was not received by the defendants through an \u201caffiliate\u201d under the FCRA, so it also does not fall under section 1681b(g)(3).</p>\n<p id=\"b396-6\">Because the medical information at issue does not fall under either section 1681b(g)(l) or (3), the district court concluded that Griffin failed to state a claim upon which relief can be granted under section 1681b(g)(4) and therefore granted the defendants\u2019 motion to dismiss under Rule 12(b)(6). We agree, essentially for the same reasons set out by the district court. At a more general level, because the medical information here is not connected to any consumer report, section 1681b(g)(4) cannot apply.<footnotemark>9</footnotemark></p>\n<p id=\"b396-14\">Because' we conclude that the district court correctly granted the defendants\u2019 motion to dismiss, we also conclude that it properly denied Griffin\u2019s cross-motion for partial summary judgment.</p>\n<p id=\"b396-15\">For the reasons set out above, we AFFIRM.</p>\n<footnote label=\"*\">\n<p id=\"b394-11\"> Pursuant to 5th Cir.
