Collins appeals his sentence, arguing that the district court<footnotemark>1</footnotemark> incorrectly applied a greater base offense level on the basis of a determination that Collins\u2019s pri- or Iowa conviction for aggravated assault constituted a \u201ccrime of violence\u201d under United States Sentencing Guidelines (U.S.S.G. or Guidelines) \u00a7 2K2.1(a)(2). We affirm.</p>\n<p id=\"b621-5\">After Collins pleaded guilty to being a felon in possession of a firearm, a probation officer prepared a presentence investigation report (PSR). The PSR applied \u00a7 2K2.1(a)(2), which provides for a base offense level of 24 for possession of a firearm by a felon if the defendant was previously convicted of two felony crimes of violence. The PSR based its application of \u00a7 2K2.1(a)(2) on two of Collins\u2019s previous state court convictions that it classified as crimes of violence: first degree theft and aggravated assault. Collins objected to the offense level calculated in the PSR, arguing, among other things, that his prior state conviction for aggravated assault did not constitute a crime of violence. Collins renewed this objection at sentencing, and the parties submitted several documents regarding Collins\u2019s aggravated assault conviction.</p>\n<p id=\"b621-6\">These documents included relevant portions of the Iowa Code defining aggravated assault and dangerous weapon, Iowa\u2019s jury instructions for aggravated assault and dangerous weapon, the trial information for Collins\u2019s aggravated assault conviction, the minutes of testimony relied upon by the state court in accepting Collins\u2019s guilty plea, and the transcript of the plea proceeding. Collins agreed that the minutes of testimony, which incorporated a police report, formed the factual basis for his plea. According to the police report, Collins grabbed a baseball bat from the victim and pushed her into a wall. Witnesses also reported that Collins attempted to swing the bat at the victim.</p>\n<p id=\"b621-10\">The district court reviewed the documents and determined that Collins\u2019s aggravated assault conviction constituted a crime of violence for purposes of \u00a7 2K2.1(a)(2), resulting in a base offense level of 24. The district court then calculated a total offense level of 29 and a criminal history category IV, which provided an advisory Guidelines sentencing range of 121 to 151 months, capped by the statutory maximum of 120 months. <em>See </em>18 U.S.C. \u00a7 924(a)(2). The district court sentenced Collins to 90 months\u2019 imprisonment, to be followed by two years of supervised release.</p>\n<p id=\"b621-11\">Collins concedes that the theft conviction constitutes a crime of violence, but maintains that the aggravated assault conviction does not. We review <em>de novo </em>a district court\u2019s determination that a defendant\u2019s prior conviction constitutes a crime of violence. <em>See United States v. Sampson, </em>606 F.3d 505, 511 (8th Cir.2010).</p>\n<p id=\"b621-12\">\u201cIn construing the term \u2018crime of violence\u2019 under \u00a7 2K2.1(a)(2), we look to the definition provided by U.S.S.G. \u00a7 4B1.2(a)[.]\u201d <em>Id. </em>A \u201ccrime of violence\u201d is defined in \u00a7 4B 1.2(a) as:</p>\n<blockquote id=\"AVu\">any offense under federal or state law, punishable by imprisonment for a term exceeding one year, that\u2014</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b621-13\">(1) has as an element the use, attempted use, or threatened use of physical force against the person of another, or</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b621-14\">(2) is burglary of a dwelling, arson, or extortion, involves use of explosives, or otherwise involves conduct that presents a serious potential risk of physical injury to another.</blockquote>\n<p id=\"b622-3\"><page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"594\">*594</page-number>\u201c[T]he phrase \u2018physical force\u2019 means <em>violent </em>force \u2014 that is, force capable of causing physical pain or injury to another person.\u201d <em>Johnson v. United States, </em>559 U.S. 133, 140, 130 S.Ct. 1265, 176 L.Ed.2d 1 (2010).</p>\n<p id=\"b622-4\">To determine whether the offense for which Collins was convicted qualifies as a crime of violence, we look only to the offense\u2019s statutory definition and disregard the factual underpinnings of his conviction. <em>See Sampson, </em>606 F.3d at 511; <em>see also Begay v. United States, </em>553 U.S. 137, 141, 128 S.Ct. 1581, 170 L.Ed.2d 490 (2008). To identify the precise statute and subsection to which Collins pleaded guilty, however, \u201cwe may look to \u2018the charging document, the terms of a plea agreement or transcript of colloquy between judge and defendant in which the factual basis for the plea was confirmed by the defendant, or to some comparable judicial record of this information.\u2019 \u201d <em>United States v. Williams, </em>537 F.3d 969, 973 (8th Cir.2008) (quoting <em>Shepard v. United States, </em>544 U.S. 13, 26, 125 S.Ct. 1254, 161 L.Ed.2d 205 (2005) (plurality opinion)); <em>see also United States v. Vinton, </em>631 F.3d 476, 484 (8th Cir.2011) (\u201cWhen a statute of conviction encompasses several different crimes, some of which qualify as crimes of violence and some of which do not, we may use a \u2018modified categorical approach\u2019 to determine which part of the statute was the basis for conviction.\u201d).</p>\n<p id=\"b622-5\">Collins\u2019s trial information alleged that he committed the crime of aggravated assault in violation of Iowa Code \u00a7\u00a7 708.1 and 708.2(3) and explained: \u201cThe said JULIAN J. COLLINS on or about September 24, 2008 in the County of Des Moines, and State of Iowa, did assault the person of Wendy Littrell and in doing so displayed a dangerous weapon in a threatening manner.\u201d The judgment likewise reflected that Collins pleaded guilty to aggravated assault in violation of Iowa Code \u00a7\u00a7 708.1 and 708.2(3).</p>\n<p id=\"b622-9\">Section 708.1 provides the three ways in which a person can commit an assault.<footnotemark>2</footnotemark> In turn, \u00a7 708.2(3) provides: \u201cA person who commits an assault, as defined in section 708.1, and uses or displays a dangerous weapon in connection with the assault, is guilty of an aggravated misdemeanor.\u201d Aso relevant is the definition of dangerous weapon found in Iowa Code \u00a7 702.7. Section 702.7 defines \u201cdangerous weapon\u201d in the following two ways:</p>\n<blockquote id=\"b622-10\">A \u201cdangerous weapon\u201d is any instrument or device designed primarily for use in inflicting death or injury upon a human being or animal, and which is capable of inflicting death upon a human being when used in the manner for which it was designed, except a bow and arrow when possessed and used for hunting or any other lawful purpose. Additionally, any instrument or device of any sort whatsoever which is actually used in such a manner as to indicate that the defendant intends to inflict death or serious injury upon the other, and which, when so used, is capable of inflicting death upon a human being, is a dangerous weapon.</blockquote>\n<p id=\"b622-11\">It is not clear from the relevant documents which subpart of \u00a7 708.1 formed the <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"595\">*595</page-number>basis of Collins\u2019s conviction. The documents, however, clearly indicate that Collins displayed a dangerous weapon in connection with the assault in violation of \u00a7 708.2(3). Further, the minutes of testimony reveal that the dangerous weapon Collins displayed was a baseball bat. Accordingly, the second definition of dangerous weapon applies. This definition of dangerous weapon has an element of threatened use of physical force \u2014 that is, force capable of causing physical pain or injury to another person \u2014 because to be a dangerous weapon, the baseball bat must have been \u201cused in such a manner as to indicate that the defendant intended] to inflict death or serious injury upon the other[.]\u201d Iowa Code \u00a7 702.7. Collins\u2019s Iowa conviction for aggravated assault thus constitutes a crime of violence under \u00a7 2K2.1(a)(2).</p>\n<p id=\"b623-5\">The sentence is affirmed.</p>\n<footnote label=\"1\">\n<p id=\"b621-7\">.
