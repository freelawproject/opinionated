Goins negotiated a Fed.R.Crim.P. 11(c)(1)(C) agreement, in which the parties stipulated that a 132-month sentence was appropriate. The district court accepted the sentencing stipulation and sentenced Goins to 132 months in prison.</p>\n<p id=\"b312-26\">Goins appeals. His attorney has filed a brief pursuant to <em>Anders v. California, </em>386 <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"285\">*285</page-number>U.S. 738, 87 S.Ct. 1396, 18 L.Ed.2d 493 (1967), questioning whether the district court complied with Fed.R.Crim.P. 11 and whether the sentence was reasonable. Goins has filed a pro se supplemental brief raising an additional issue. We affirm in part and dismiss in part.</p>\n<p id=\"b313-5\">Our review of the transcript of Goins\u2019 Rule 11 transcript reveals that the district court complied with the Rule, that the plea was knowingly and voluntarily entered, and that Goins conceded his guilt. Accordingly, we affirm his conviction.</p>\n<p id=\"b313-6\">We lack jurisdiction to review Goins\u2019 sentence. A defendant may appeal a sentence to which he stipulated in a Rule 11(c)(1)(C) plea agreement only if his sentence \u201cwas (1) imposed in violation of the law, (2)[was] imposed as a result of an incorrect application of the Guidelines, or (3) is greater than the sentence set forth in the plea agreement.\u201d <em>United States v. Calderon, </em>428 F.3d 928, 932 (10th Cir. 2005); <em>see </em>18 U.S.C. \u00a7 3742(a), (c) (2012). None of the exceptions applies here. Goins\u2019 sentence is below the statutory maximum of twenty years. <em>See </em>21 U.S.C. \u00a7 841(b)(1)(C). Further, the sentence was not imposed as a result of an incorrect application of the Guidelines because it was based on the parties\u2019 agreement rather than on the district court\u2019s calculation of the Guidelines range. <em>See United States v. Brown, </em>653 F.3d 337, 339-40 (4th Cir. 2011); <em>United States v. Cieslowski, </em>410 F.3d 353, 364 (7th Cir.2005). Finally, 132 months is the exact sentence set forth in the plea agreement. Accordingly, we conclude that we may not review Goins\u2019 stipulated sentence.<footnotemark>*</footnotemark></p>\n<p id=\"b313-7\">Pursuant to <em>Anders, </em>we have reviewed the record in this case and have found no meritorious issues for appeal. We therefore affirm Goins\u2019 conviction but dismiss the appeal of his sentence. This court requires that counsel inform his client, in writing, of the right to petition the Supreme Court of the United States for further review. If Goins requests that a petition be filed, but counsel believes that such a petition would be frivolous, then counsel may move in this court for leave to withdraw from representation. Counsel\u2019s motion must state that a copy thereof was served on his client. We dispense with oral argument because the facts and legal contentions are adequately presented in the materials before this court and argument would not aid the decisional process.</p>\n<p id=\"b313-10\">\n<em>AFFIRMED IN PART; DISMISSED IN PART.</em>\n</p>\n<footnote label=\"*\">\n<p id=\"b313-8\"> Because Goins\u2019 sentence was based on the agreement and not the Guidelines, we decline to address his contention in the pro se brief that he was improperly determined to be a career offender. We note, however, that he had more than enough criminal history points to place him in criminal history category VI.</p>\n</footnote>\n</opinion>\n</casebody>\n",
