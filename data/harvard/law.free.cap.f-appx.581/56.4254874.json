Williams (\u201cWilliams\u201d) is the former Executive Director of the Civil Service Commission of Nassau County who alleges that he was fired in retaliation for his public comments before the Nassau County Legislature. Pursuant to 42 U.S.C. \u00a7 1983, Williams brought suit alleging Defendants terminated his employment in violation of the First Amendment. Williams appeals from a Memorandum &amp; Order dated March 30, 2011, granting Defendants-Appellees\u2019 motion for reconsideration and thereby granting summary judgment for Defendants-Appellees and dismissing Williams\u2019s Complaint in its entirety. <em>See Williams v. County of Nassau, </em>779 F.Supp.2d 276 (E.D.N.Y.2011). We assume the parties\u2019 familiarity with the underlying facts, procedural history, and issues on appeal.</p>\n<p id=\"b85-9\">This court reviews de novo a district court\u2019s grant of summary judgment, \u201cconstruing the evidence in the light most favorable to the nonmoving party and drawing all reasonable inferences in that party\u2019s favor.\u201d <em>Kuebel v. Black &amp; Decker Inc., </em>643 F.3d 352, 358 (2d Cir.2011).</p>\n<p id=\"b85-10\">Because Williams spoke before the Nassau County Legislature not \u201cas a citizen on a matter of public concern,\u201d <em>Garcetti v. Ceballos, </em>547 U.S. 410, 418, 126 S.Ct. 1951, 164 L.Ed.2d 689 (2006), but rather \u201cpursuant to his official duties\u201d as defined by this Court in <em>Weintraub v. Board of Education, </em>593 F.3d 196, 203 (2d Cir.2010), we hold that Williams\u2019s speech is not protected by the First Amendment and affirm the district court\u2019s grant of summary judgment.</p>\n<p id=\"b85-12\">We have considered Williams\u2019s remaining arguments and find them to be without merit. For the reasons stated above, the judgment of the district court is</p>\n<p id=\"b85-13\">AFFIRMED.</p>\n</opinion>\n</casebody>\n",
