We review the district court\u2019s determination of whether a defendant has accepted responsibility for clear error. <em>See United States v. Rosas, </em>615 F.3d 1058, 1066 (9th Cir.2010). The district court did not clearly err in finding that Rubin\u2019s obstruction of justice, including his flight to Mexico while sentencing was pending in this case, was inconsistent with acceptance of responsibility. <em>See id. </em>at 1066-67.</p>\n<p id=\"b672-4\">AFFIRMED.</p>\n<footnote label=\"**\">\n<p id=\"b671-28\"> This disposition is not appropriate for publication and is not precedent except as provided by 9th Cir.
