(\u201cTVP\u201d) appeals from the judgment of the United States District Court for the Southern District of New York (Carter, <em>J.), </em>granting partial summary judgment in favor of Plaintiff-Appellee Spanski Enterprises, Inc. (\u201cSEI\u201d). SEI cross appeals. We assume the parties\u2019 familiarity with the underlying facts, the procedural history, and the issues presented for review.</p>\n<p id=\"b100-17\">This appeal arises from prolonged disputes between TVP, a public broadcasting corporation wholly owned by the Republic of Poland, and SEI, which has been TVP\u2019s exclusive distributor of television programming content to the Polish diaspora in the Americas. The dispute, over which party can broadcast certain programming and for how long, is governed by a handful of written contracts.</p>\n<p id=\"b100-18\">We review a district court\u2019s decision to grant or deny summary judgment <em>de novo. Smith ex rel. Estate of Smith v. Fed. Reserve Bank of N.Y., </em>346 F.3d 264, 267 (2d Cir.2003). And \u201c[t]he interpretation of a contract is generally a question of law,\u201d also \u201csubject to our de novo review.\u201d <em>Network Publ\u2019g Corp. v. Shapiro, </em>895 F.2d 97, 99 (2d Cir.1990).</p>\n<p id=\"b100-19\">1. SEI became the exclusive distributor of TV Polonia in 1994 and of TVP Info in 2002. Prior litigation between SEI and TVP ended in a Settlement Agreement, executed in 2009, that provides, in section II.A: \u201cSEI is and shall remain the exclusive distributor of TV Polonia and TVP Info programming content in the territory of North and South America by any and all means of distribution....\u201d It is undisputed that, as to TV Polonia, SEI\u2019s exclusivity extends until 2019. TVP argues that it nonetheless is entitled to broadcast on TVP Info a small percentage of TV Polonia programming content, which it characterizes as <em>de minimis. </em>We disagree.</p>\n<p id=\"b101-4\"><page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"73\">*73</page-number>There has been a 2-3% overlap in the TV Polonia content broadcast on TVP Info. TVP characterizes this overlap as \u201cnegligible\u201d or <em>\u201cde minimis.\u201d </em>However, the relevant contracts contain no exception for <em>de minimis </em>infringement of SEI\u2019s exclusivity rights. And under New York law, \u201ccourts may not by construction add or excise terms, nor distort the meaning of those used and thereby make a new contract for the parties under the guise of interpreting the writing.\u201d <em>Reiss v. Fin. Performance Corp., </em>97 N.Y.2d 195, 738 N.Y.S.2d 658, 764 N.E.2d 958, 961 (2001) (internal quotation marks omitted).</p>\n<p id=\"b101-5\">TVP argues that Section II.A. of the Settlement Agreement \u2014 the provision that confirms SEI\u2019s exclusivity rights for all <em>programming content </em>rather than for the channels only \u2014 should be discounted as \u201cgeneral\u201d and \u201cprefatory.\u201d However, \u201cthe fundamental rule of contract interpretation [is] that a court must strive to give meaning to every sentence, clause, and word.\u201d <em>N.Y. Marine &amp; Gen. Ins. Co. v. Lafarge N. Am., Inc., </em>599 F.3d 102, 116 (2d Cir.2010) (internal quotation marks and citation omitted). Section II.A is no more \u201cgeneral\u201d or \u201cprefatory\u201d than any other provision of the Settlement Agreement.</p>\n<p id=\"b101-6\">Finally, TVP emphasizes that TVP Info (mainly news) and TV Polonia (mainly entertainment) do not compete with each other. But SEI\u2019s exclusivity rights are not made to depend on considerations of competition.</p>\n<p id=\"b101-7\">In sum, TVP is prohibited by the Settlement Agreement from distributing TV Polonia\u2019s programming content on TVP Info, or elsewhere, until 2019.<footnotemark>1</footnotemark></p>\n<p id=\"b101-9\">2. SEI cross appeals, contending that any distribution of TVP Info \u2014 regardless of whether any content overlaps with TV Polonia \u2014 is prohibited until 2019. The district court rejected this interpretation as \u201cstretchpng] beyond any reasonable construction of the text as written.\u201d We agree.</p>\n<p id=\"b101-10\">Section II.A of the Settlement Agreement provides that \u201cSEI is and shall remain the exclusive distributor of ... TVP Info programming content.\u201d The Section specifies no end date; nor does any other provision in the Settlement Agreement. But the parties\u2019 other contracts do. The 1994 Agreement sets 2019 as the end date for SEI\u2019s exclusivity rights to TV Polonia, and the 2002 Addendum sets 2012 as the end date for SEI\u2019s exclusivity rights to TVP Info. Because the Settlement Agreement does not deal with end dates, the terms set in the 1994 Agreement and its 2002 Addendum remain valid. Hence, all of SEI\u2019s rights to TVP Info expired in 2012.</p>\n<p id=\"b101-11\">Any reference to the 1994 Agreement in the Settlement Agreement necessarily includes the relevant provisions of the 2002 Addendum that modified it. <em>See </em>2002 Addendum (\u201cThe following amendments shall be made to the Agreement concluded between the Parties on 14 December 1994.... \u201d); Settlement Agreement \u00a7 II.N (\u201cAll other terms of the Agreement of 1994, <em>as subsequently amended, </em>shall remain in full force and effect, except in the event of any conflict between such prior agreements and this agreement, this agreement shall control.\u201d) (emphasis added). The references to the 1994 Agreement in the Settlement Agreement are <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"74\">*74</page-number>references to the 1994 Agreement <em>as amended, </em>by the 2002 Addendum. Hence, the 2012 end date for SEI\u2019s exclusivity rights to TVP Info \u2014 laid out clearly in the 2002 Addendum \u2014 controls.<footnotemark>2</footnotemark></p>\n<p id=\"b102-4\">For the foregoing reasons, and finding no merit in the parties\u2019 other arguments, we hereby AFFIRM the judgment of the district court.</p>\n<footnote label=\"1\">\n<p id=\"b101-8\">. The district court reached the same conclusion, but also relied on Section II.E of the Settlement Agreement, which prohibits TVP from distributing \"any other channels ... that contain any of the same programming that is contained, has been contained, or will be contained in either TV Polonia or TVP Info.\u201d (emphasis added). Because we conclude that Section II.A is dispositive, we need not address the district court's construction of Section II.E.</p>\n</footnote>\n<footnote label=\"2\">\n<p id=\"b102-13\">. At oral argument, SEI pressed the argument that Section II.A was intended to grant it a new right, requiring that TVP use SEI as its exclusive TVP Info distributor in North and South America should TVP wish to distribute TVP Info following the expiration of the 2002 Addendum. However, the plain language of Section II.A does not create any new right. By asserting that SEI \"shall remain\u201d TVP\u2019s \"exclusive distributor,\u201d Section II.A makes clear that the exclusive distribution rights to TVP Info programming content are those granted in the 2002 Addendum.</p>\n</footnote>\n</opinion>\n</casebody>\n",
