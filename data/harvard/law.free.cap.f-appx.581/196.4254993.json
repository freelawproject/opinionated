On appeal, counsel has filed a brief pursuant to <em>Anders v. California, </em>386 U.S. 738, 87 S.Ct. 1396, 18 L.Ed.2d 493 (1967), asserting that there are no meritorious issues for appeal, but questioning whether the district court erred in assessing a two-point enhancement and calculating the drug quantity associated with the offense, and challenging the reasonableness of Reid\u2019s sentence. Although advised of his right to file a supplemental pro se brief, Reid has not done so. The Government seeks to dismiss the appeal as untimely and as barred by the appellate waiver provision in the plea agreement.</p>\n<p id=\"b224-24\">By prior order, we remanded the appeal to the district court to determine whether to extend the appeal period under Fed. R.App. P. 4(b)(4). The district court found good cause to extend the appeal period, and therefore the appeal is timely and not subject to dismissal on that basis.</p>\n<p id=\"b224-25\">We therefore proceed to consider the Government\u2019s alternate basis for dismissal-the appellate waiver. We review de novo the validity of an appellate waiver. <em>United States v. Copeland, </em>707 F.3d 522, 528 (4th <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"197\">*197</page-number>Cir.), <em>cert. denied, </em>\u2014 U.S.-, 134 S.Ct. 126, 187 L.Ed.2d 89 (2013). We \u201cgenerally will enforce a waiver ... if the record establishes that the waiver is valid and that the issue being appealed is within the scope of the waiver.\u201d <em>United States v. Thornsbury, </em>670 F.3d 532, 537 (4th Cir. 2012) (internal quotation marks and alteration omitted). A defendant\u2019s waiver is valid if he agreed to it \u201cknowingly and intelligently.\u201d <em>United States v. Manigan, </em>592 F.3d 621, 627 (4th Cir.2010). \u201cAlthough the validity of an appeal waiver often depends on the adequacy of the plea colloquy, the issue ultimately is evaluated by reference to the totality of the circumstances,\u201d <em>United States v. Davis, </em>689 F.3d 349, 355 (4th Cir.2012) (internal quotation marks omitted), such as \u201cthe experience and conduct of the accused, as well as the accused\u2019s educational background and familiarity -with the terms of the plea agreement.\u201d Thor<em>nsbury, </em>670 F.3d at 537 (internal quotation marks omitted).</p>\n<p id=\"b225-6\">Our review of the record leads us to conclude that Reid knowingly and intelligently pled guilty and waived his right to appeal his sentence. Because the sentencing issues he seeks to raise on appeal fall within the scope of the waiver, we grant the Government\u2019s motion to dismiss Reid\u2019s appeal of his sentence and dismiss this portion of the appeal.</p>\n<p id=\"b225-7\">Although the waiver provision in the plea agreement precludes review of the sentence, the waiver does not preclude review of any errors in Reid\u2019s conviction that may be revealed pursuant to the review required by <em>Anders. </em>In accordance with <em>Anders, </em>we have reviewed the entire record and have found nothing that calls into question the validity of Reid\u2019s conviction. Thus, as to the conviction, we affirm.</p>\n<p id=\"b225-8\">This court requires that counsel inform Reid, in writing, of his right to petition the Supreme Court of the United States for further review. If Reid requests that a petition be filed, but counsel believes that such a petition would be frivolous, then counsel may move in this court for leave to withdraw from representation. Counsel\u2019s motion must state that a copy thereof was served on Reid. We dispense with oral argument because the facts and legal contentions are adequately presented in the materials before this court and argument would not aid the decisional process.</p>\n<p id=\"b225-10\">\n<em>AFFIRMED IN PART; DISMISSED IN PART.</em>\n</p>\n</opinion>\n</casebody>\n",
