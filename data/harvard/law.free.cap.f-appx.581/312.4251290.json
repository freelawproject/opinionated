El Sayedri was also convicted of one count of passport forgery, in violation of 18 U.S.C. \u00a7 1543 (2012), and one count of making false statements, in violation of 18 U.S.C. \u00a7 1001 (2012). We affirm.</p>\n<p id=\"b341-10\">The appellants contend that the district court erred in denying their motion for a judgment of acquittal. We review de novo the district court\u2019s denial of a Rule 29 motion. <em>United States v. Jaensch, </em>665 F.3d 83, 93 (4th Cir.2011). \u201cIf there is substantial evidence to support the verdict, after viewing all of the evidence and the inferences therefrom in the light most favorable to the Government, the court must affirm.\u201d <em>United States v. Penniegraft, </em>641 F.3d 566, 572 (4th Cir.2011) (internal quotation marks omitted). \u201cSubstantial evidence is that evidence which a reasonable finder of fact could accept as adequate and sufficient to support a conclusion of a defendant\u2019s guilt beyond a reasonable doubt.\u201d <em>United States v. Al Sabahi, </em>719 F.3d 305, 311 (4th Cir.) (internal quotation marks omitted), <em>cert. denied, </em>\u2014 U.S. -, 134 S.Ct. 464, 187 L.Ed.2d 311 (2013). The court does not \u201creview the credibility of the witnesses and assume[s] that the jury resolved all contradictions in the testimony in favor of the government.\u201d <em>United States v. Foster, </em>507 F.3d 233, 245 (4th Cir.2007).</p>\n<p id=\"b341-12\">To support a conviction for conspiracy to commit immigration document fraud, the Government must prove beyond a reasonable doubt that there was an agreement between two or more persons to commit immigration document fraud, by agreeing to present an application or document required by immigration laws that will contain a false statement of a material fact and that at least one of the conspirators engaged in an overt act in furtherance of that agreement. <em>United States v. Archer, </em>671 F.3d 149, 154 &amp; n. 1 (2d Cir.2011).</p>\n<p id=\"b341-13\">We have reviewed the appellants\u2019 claims and conclude they are without merit. Although the appellants contend that no conduct relating to the charge began in 2000, as the indictment alleged, the beginning date of the conspiracy is not an element of the offense. <em>United States v. Queen, </em>132 F.3d 991, 999 (4th Cir.1997) (factfinder may find that the conspiracy started at anytime within the alleged time frame). Also, after reviewing the record, we conclude that there was sufficient evidence to support the conspiracy charge. Likewise, regarding El Sayedri\u2019s other two convictions, we conclude that both are supported by sufficient evidence.</p>\n<p id=\"b341-14\">The appellants also challenge the district court\u2019s denial of a motion for a mistrial, which we review for an abuse of discretion. <em>United States v. Wallace, </em>515 F.3d 327, 330 (4th Cir.2008) (discussing motion for mistrial). The district court\u2019s denial \u201cwill be disturbed only under the most extraordinary of circumstances.\u201d <em>United States v. Dorlouis, </em>107 F.3d 248, 257 (4th Cir.1997). We conclude that the appellants\u2019 challenge to the district court\u2019s denial of their motion for a mistrial after a third defendant was <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"314\">*314</page-number>dismissed from the case is wholly without merit.</p>\n<p id=\"b342-4\">We also conclude that the charges were properly joined and that the district court did not err in denying the appellants\u2019 motion for a severance, as the charges were logically related to each other. <em>See United States v. Cardwell, </em>433 F.3d 378, 385 (4th Cir.2005). Finally, we conclude that the court did not abuse its discretion when it denied the motion for a mistrial after it granted a judgment of acquittal as to some, but not all of the charges. <em>See United States v. Hornsby, </em>666 F.3d 296, 311 (4th Cir.2012).</p>\n<p id=\"b342-5\">Accordingly, we affirm the convictions and sentences. We dispense with oral argument because the facts and legal contentions are adequately presented in the materials before this Court and argument would not aid the decisional process.</p>\n<p id=\"b342-6\">\n<em>AFFIRMED.</em>\n</p>\n</opinion>\n</casebody>\n",
