R. 34(b). Because Carr-Stephenson does not challenge in her informal brief the basis for the district court\u2019s disposition, she has forfeited appellate review of the court\u2019s order. <em>Id. </em>Accordingly, we affirm the district court\u2019s judgment. We dispense with oral argument because the facts and legal contentions are adequately presented in the materials before this court and argument would not aid the decisional process.</p>\n<p id=\"b221-10\">\n<em>PANEL REHEARING GRANTED; EN BANC REHEARING DENIED; AFFIRMED.</em>\n</p>\n<footnote label=\"*\">\n<p id=\"b221-12\"> In an opinion issued on March 31, 2014, we dismissed Carr-Stephenson's appeal for lack of jurisdiction on the ground that her notice of appeal was untimely filed. Carr-Stephenson then filed a petition for en banc rehearing that persuades us she timely filed a notice of appeal that did not appe\u00e1r in the electronic record. Accordingly, although we deny Carr-Stephenson\u2019s petition for rehearing en banc, we grant panel rehearing, and conclude that Carr-Stephenson did in fact file a timely notice of appeal. Accordingly, we vacate the prior opinion and issue this opinion in its stead.</p>\n</footnote>\n</opinion>\n</casebody>\n",
