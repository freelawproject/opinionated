McCright seeks to appeal the district court\u2019s order treating his Fed. R.Civ.P. 60(b) motion as a successive 28 U.S.C. \u00a7 2255 (2012) motion, and dismissing it on that basis. Because we conclude, after reviewing the record; that the district court properly construed McCright\u2019s motion as a successive habeas petition, the <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"288\">*288</page-number>order is not appealable unless a circuit justice or judge issues a certificate of appealability. 28 U.S.C. \u00a7 2253(c)(1)(B) (2012). A certificate of appealability will not issue absent \u201ca substantial showing of the denial of a constitutional right.\u201d 28 U.S.C. \u00a7 2253(c)(2) (2012). When the district court denies relief on procedural grounds, as the district court did in this case, the prisoner must demonstrate both that the dispositive procedural ruling is debatable, and that the motion states a debatable claim of the denial of a constitutional right. <em>See Slack v. McDaniel, </em>529 U.S. 473, 484-85, 120 S.Ct. 1595, 146 L.Ed.2d 542 (2000).</p>\n<p id=\"b316-4\">We have independently reviewed the record and conclude that McCright has not made the requisite showing. Accordingly, we deny a certificate of appealability and dismiss the appeal.</p>\n<p id=\"b316-5\">Additionally, we construe McCright\u2019s notice of appeal and informal brief as an application to file a second or successive \u00a7 2255 motion. <em>United States v. Winestock, </em>340 F.3d 200, 208 (4th Cir.2003). In order to obtain authorization to file a successive \u00a7 2255 motion, a prisoner must assert claims based on either:</p>\n<blockquote id=\"b316-6\">(1) newly discovered evidence that ... would be sufficient to establish by clear and convincing evidence that no reasonable factfinder would have found the movant guilty of the offense; or</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b316-7\">(2) a new rule of constitutional law, made retroactive to cases on collateral review by the Supreme Court, that was previously unavailable.</blockquote>\n<p id=\"b316-8\">28 U.S.C. \u00a7 2255(h) (2012). McCright\u2019s claims do not satisfy either of these criteria. Therefore, we deny authorization to file a successive \u00a7 2255 motion.</p>\n<p id=\"b316-9\">We dispense with oral argument because the facts and legal contentions are adequately presented in the materials before this Court and argument would not aid the decisional process.</p>\n<p id=\"b316-11\">\n<em>DISMISSED.</em>\n</p>\n</opinion>\n</casebody>\n",
