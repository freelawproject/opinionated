The costs incurred in defending a suit predicated on a materially and intentionally false fundamental misrepresentation are recoverable under Judiciary Law \u00a7 487 even if the court <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"10\">*10</page-number>never acted on the belief that the misrepresentation was true. <em>(Country-Wide Ins.

III. Armand Rosenberg\u2019s filing of the complaint falsely alleging standing when none existed and the subsequent submission of knowingly and materially false affidavits did work a deceit on the court, and therefore the certified questions should be altered accordingly. <em>(Matter of Schildhaus, </em>23 AD2d 152; <em>Schindler v Issler &amp; Schrage, </em>262 AD2d 226; <em>Guardian Life Ins.

The lawsuit accused the Amalfitanos of fraudulently purchasing what remained of the Cos\u00edalas family business, a partnership known as 27 Whitehall Street Group. On appeal, the Second Circuit concluded that it could affirm the District Court\u2019s judgment \u201cin its entirety\u201d only if, in addition to Rosenberg\u2019s actual deceit of the Appellate Division, his \u201cattempted deceit\u201d of the trial court\u2014\u201cthe false allegations in the complaint in the <em>Cos\u00edalas </em>litigation\u201d representing that Peter Cos\u00edalas was a partner in 27 Whitehall Street Group\u2014 would \u201csupport[ ] a cause of action under section 487 and was the proximate cause of the Amalfitanos\u2019 damages in defending the litigation from its inception\u201d <em>(Amalfitano v Rosenberg, </em>533 F3d 117, 125 [2d Cir 2008]).<footnotemark>*</footnotemark></p>\n<p id=\"b103-6\">I.</p>\n<p id=\"b103-7\">Certified Question No. 1</p>\n<p id=\"b103-8\">\u201cCan a successful lawsuit for treble damages brought under N.Y. Jud. Law \u00a7 487 be based on an attempted but unsuccessful deceit?\u201d (533 F3d at 126.)</p>\n<p id=\"b103-9\">Rosenberg equates forfeiture under Judiciary Law \u00a7 487 with a tort claim for fraud. And under New York common law, \u201c[t]o maintain an action based on fraudulent representations ... in tort for damages, it is sufficient to show that the defendant knowingly uttered a falsehood intending to deprive the plaintiff of a benefit <em>and that the plaintiff was thereby deceived </em>and damaged\u201d <em>(Channel Master Corp. v Aluminium Ltd. Sales, 4 </em>NY2d 403, 406-407 [1958] [emphasis added]). Thus, Rosenberg argues, section 487 does not permit recovery for an attempted but unsuccessful deceit practiced on a court. And here, the trial judge was concededly never fooled by misrepresentations regarding Peter Cos\u00edalas\u2019s partnership status.</p>\n<p id=\"b104-4\"><page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"12\">*12</page-number>As the District Court correctly observed, however, Judiciary Law \u00a7 487 does not derive from common-law fraud. Instead, as the Amalfitanos point out, section 487 descends from the first Statute of Westminster, which was adopted by the Parliament summoned by King Edward I of England in 1275. The relevant provision of that statute specified that</p>\n<blockquote id=\"b104-5\">\u201cif any Serjeant, Pleader, or other, do any manner of Deceit or Collusion in the King\u2019s Court, or consent [unto it,] in deceit of the Court [or] to beguile the Court, or the Party, and thereof be at-tainted, he shall be imprisoned for a Year and a Day, and from thenceforth shall not be heard to plead in [that] Court for any Man; and if he be no Pleader, he shall be imprisoned in like manner by the Space of a Year and a Day at least; and if the Trespass require greater Punishment, it shall be at the King\u2019s Pleasure\u201d (3 Edw, ch 29; <em>see generally </em>Thomas Pitt Taswell-Langmead, English Constitutional History, at 153-154 [Theodore ET. Plucknett ed, Sweet &amp; Maxwell, 10th ed 1946]).</blockquote>\n<p id=\"b104-6\">Five centuries later, in 1787, the Legislature adopted a law with strikingly similar language, and added an award of treble damages, as follows:</p>\n<blockquote id=\"b104-7\"><em>\u201cAnd be it further enacted . </em>. . [t]hat if any counsellor, attorney, solicitor, pleader, advocate, proctor, or other, do any manner of deceit or collusion, in any court of justice, or consent unto it in deceit of the court, or to beguile the court or the party, and thereof be convicted, he shall be punished by fine and imprisonment and shall moreover pay to the party grieved, treble damages, and costs of suit\u201d (L 1787, ch 35, \u00a7 5).</blockquote>\n<p id=\"b104-8\">In 1830, the Legislature carried forward virtually identical language in the Revised Statutes of New York, prescribing that</p>\n<blockquote id=\"b104-9\">\u201c[a]ny counsellor, attorney or solicitor, who shall be guilty of any deceit or collusion, or shall consent to any deceit or collusion, with intent to deceive the court or any party, shall be deemed guilty of a misdemeanor, and on conviction shall be punished by fine or imprisonment, or both, at the discretion of the court. He shall also forfeit to the party injured by his deceit or collusion, treble damages, to be <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"13\">*13</page-number>recovered in a civil action\u201d (2 Rev Stat of NY, part III, ch III, tit II, art 3, \u00a7 69, at 215-216 [2d ed 1836]).</blockquote>\n<p id=\"b105-4\">The Legislature later codified this misdemeanor crime and the additional civil forfeiture remedy as section 148 of the Penal Code of 1881, providing that</p>\n<blockquote id=\"b105-5\">\u201c[a]n attorney or counselor who . . .</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b105-6\">\u201c[i]s guilty of any deceit or collusion, or consents to any deceit or collusion, with intent to deceive the court or any party as prohibited by section 70 of the Code of Civil Procedure; . . .</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b105-7\">\u201c[i]s guilty of a misdemeanor, and in addition to the punishment prescribed therefor by this Code, he forfeits to the party injured treble damages, to be recovered in a civil action\u201d (L 1881, ch 676, \u00a7 148 [1]).</blockquote>\n<p id=\"b105-8\">Section 70 of the Code of Civil Procedure, cross-referenced in section 148, similarly stated that \u201c[a]n attorney or counsellor, who is guilty of any deceit or collusion, or consents to any deceit or collusion, with intent to deceive the court or a party, forfeits, to the party injured by his deceit or collusion, treble damages. He is also guilty of a misdemeanor.\u201d The derivation note accompanying section 70 includes the following comment: \u201cAs to the meaning of the word, \u2018deceit\u2019, as used in this section, see <em>Looff </em>v. <em>Lawton, </em>14 Hun, 588\u201d (Code of Civil Procedure of the State of New York with Notes by Montgomery H. Throop [Weed, Parsons and Company 1881]).</p>\n<p id=\"b105-9\">In <em>Looff, </em>the plaintiffs accused their attorney of gulling them into bringing an unnecessary lawsuit, motivated solely by his desire to collect a large fee to represent them. In discussing the meaning of the word \u201cdeceit\u201d in section 70 (and, by extension, section 148), the General Term of the Supreme Court opined that the Legislature intended an expansive reading rather than \u201cconfining the term to common law or statutory cheats\u201d <em>(Looff v Lawton, </em>14 Hun 588, 589 [2d Dept 1878]). To support this interpretation, the court reasoned that because there was already a civil action at common law for fraud and damage that an injured party might pursue,</p>\n<blockquote id=\"b105-10\">\u201c[t]here was no occasion . . . for another statute to punish, or to give an action for the \u2018deceit\u2019 of lawyers, unless the Legislature intended that that class of persons should be liable for acts which <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"14\">*14</page-number>would be insufficient to establish a crime or a cause of action against citizens generally. The statute is limited to a peculiar class of citizens, from whom the law exacts a reasonable degree of skill, and the utmost good faith in the conduct and management of the business intrusted to them ... To mislead the court or a party is to deceive it; and, if knowingly done, constitutes criminal deceit under the statute cited\u201d <em>(id. </em>at 590).</blockquote>\n<p id=\"b106-5\">Section 148 was subsequently recodified as section 273 of the Penal Law of 1909. In conjunction with the Legislature\u2019s adoption of the revised Penal Law of 1965, section 148 was transferred from the Penal Law to the Judiciary Law as section 487 <em>(see </em>L 1965, ch 1031, \u00a7 123). There it remains today\u2014the modern-day counterpart of a statute dating from the first decades after Magna Carta; its language virtually (and remarkably) unchanged from that of a law adopted by New York\u2019s Legislature two years before the United States Constitution was ratified.</p>\n<p id=\"b106-6\">As this history shows, section 487 is not a codification of a common-law cause of action for fraud. Rather, section 487 is a unique statute of ancient origin in the criminal law of England. The operative language at issue\u2014\u201cguilty of any deceit\u201d\u2014focuses on the attorney\u2019s intent to deceive, not the deceit\u2019s success. And as the District Court pointed out, section 487 was for many years placed in the state\u2019s penal law, which \u201csupports the argument that the more appropriate context for analysis is not the law applicable to comparable civil torts but rather criminal law, where an attempt to commit an underlying offense is punishable as well [as] the underlying offense itself\u2019 <em>(Amalfatino, </em>428 F Supp 2d at 210). Further, to limit forfeiture under section 487 to successful deceits would run counter to the statute\u2019s evident intent to enforce an attorney\u2019s special obligation to protect the integrity of the courts and foster their truth-seeking function.</p>\n<p id=\"b106-7\">II.</p>\n<p id=\"b106-8\">Certified Question No. 2</p>\n<blockquote id=\"b106-9\">\u201cIn the course of such a lawsuit, may the costs of defending litigation instituted by a complaint containing a material misrepresentation of fact be treated as the proximate result of the misrepresentation if the court upon which the deceit was at<page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"15\">*15</page-number>tempted at no time acted on the belief that the misrepresentation was true?\u201d (533 F3d at 126.)</blockquote>\n<p id=\"b107-4\">In light of our answer to the first question, recovery of treble damages under Judiciary Law \u00a7 487 does not depend upon the court\u2019s belief in a material misrepresentation of fact in a complaint. When a party commences an action grounded in a material misrepresentation of fact, the opposing party is obligated to defend or default and necessarily incurs legal expenses. Because, in such a case, the lawsuit could not have gone forward in the absence of the material misrepresentation, that party\u2019s legal expenses in defending the lawsuit may be treated as the proximate result of the misrepresentation.</p>\n<p id=\"b107-5\">Accordingly, the certified questions should be answered in accordance with this opinion.</p>\n<p id=\"b107-6\">Judges Ciparick, Graffeo, Smith, Pigott and Jones concur; Chief Judge Lippman taking no part.</p>\n<p id=\"b107-7\">Following certification of questions by the United States Court of Appeals for the Second Circuit and acceptance of the questions by this Court pursuant to section 500.27 of the Rules of Practice of the Court of Appeals (22 NYCRR 500.27), and after hearing argument by counsel for the parties and consideration of the briefs and the record submitted, certified questions answered in accordance with the opinion herein.</p>\n<footnote label=\"*\">\n<p id=\"b103-10\"> The facts and circumstances of the underlying litigation and Rosenberg\u2019s conduct are set out in detail in the District Court\u2019s decision and the Second Circuit\u2019s certification opinion.</p>\n</footnote>\n</opinion>\n</casebody>\n",
