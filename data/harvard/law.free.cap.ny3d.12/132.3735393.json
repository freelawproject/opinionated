Pursuant to the MOU, IDT was to buy from Telefonica a 10% equity share in NewCo, a corporation that would \u201cconstruct, establish, operate and maintain . . . and . . . sell capacity on\u201d SAm-1. A separate entity was to be created to market products associated with the network. IDT would have the right to buy capacity in the network, at a favorable rate, during its operational life.</p>\n<p id=\"b228-8\">In June 2000, Telefonica informed IDT that it intended to modify the MOU, replacing NewCo with a larger entity, Emerg\u00eda, in which Telefonica offered IDT a five percent share. According to IDT, Morgan Stanley Dean Witter <em>&amp; </em>Co. (Morgan Stanley), Telefonica\u2019s investment banker, advised IDT in the summer of 2000 that the value of a five percent interest in Emerg\u00eda was far greater than that of a 10% interest in NewCo. Nevertheless, IDT, unpersuaded, broke off negotiations with Telefonica in October 2000.</p>\n<p id=\"b228-9\">Although Morgan Stanley acted as Telefonica\u2019s investment banker in relation to SAm-1, it had previously acted on IDT\u2019s <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"137\">*137</page-number>behalf in 1999, in negotiations concerning a different proposed fiber-optic cable network, and in subsequent matters. IDT engaged Morgan Stanley as its financial adviser in regard to shares in Net2Phone, Inc. that it sold in the summer of 2000 for about $1 billion. According to IDT, in 1999-2000, Morgan Stanley requested and received confidential business and financial information concerning IDT, had access to IDT\u2019s records, and enjoyed wide-ranging communications with its executives.</p>\n<p id=\"b229-5\">IDT commenced an arbitration proceeding on May 25, 2001, against Telefonica, alleging that Telefonica had breached the MOU, in particular its provisions entitling IDT to an equity share in NewCo and giving it the right to buy capacity in SAm-1. IDT sought an award in an amount no less than $3.15 billion. IDT made no allegations against Morgan Stanley. No representative of Morgan Stanley testified, but a valuation memorandum concerning NewCo and Emerg\u00eda that Morgan Stanley had presented to IDT in 2000 was subpoenaed and submitted to the arbitration panel.</p>\n<p id=\"b229-6\">Following a lengthy hearing, the panel concluded that Telefonica had breached both the \u201ccapacity purchase\u201d and \u201cequity purchase\u201d provisions of the MOU. It calculated IDT\u2019s aggregate damages for Telefonica\u2019s capacity purchase breach to be $16,883,817. However, noting the weakness of the telecommunications market in the second half of 2000, the panel calculated that the present value of IDT\u2019s interest in NewCo was negative, and concluded that IDT had suffered no damages as a result of Telefonica\u2019s breach of the equity purchase provisions.<footnotemark>1</footnotemark> Telefonica paid IDT $21.6 million, representing damages and interest.</p>\n<p id=\"b229-7\">On November 5, 2004, IDT commenced this action against Morgan Stanley, alleging that it had provided Telefonica with confidential information about IDT, induced Telefonica to <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"138\">*138</page-number>breach the MOU and, moreover, presented false and misleading evidence to the arbitration panel, affecting the panel\u2019s assessment of IDT\u2019s damages. Its complaint contains five causes of action: (1) breach of fiduciary duty, (2) intentional interference with existing contract, (3) intentional interference with prospective business relations, (4) misappropriation of confidential and proprietary business information, and (5) unjust enrichment. IDT seeks compensatory damages, disgorgement of profits obtained by Morgan Stanley in connection with SAm-1, punitive damages, and the return of a $10,000,000 fee that IDT paid Morgan Stanley in relation to the Net2Phone, Inc. transaction, plus interest and fees.</p>\n<p id=\"b230-5\">Morgan Stanley moved to dismiss the complaint under CPLR 3211, arguing, among other things, that IDT\u2019s claims were barred by collateral estoppel and the statute of limitations. Supreme Court dismissed IDT\u2019s intentional interference with prospective business relations claim, but otherwise denied the motion (2006 NY Slip Op 30076[U]). On appeal, the Appellate Division affirmed, with one Justice dissenting, holding that IDT\u2019s remaining claims were not barred by collateral estoppel, because IDT had not \u201chad an opportunity to conduct discovery on the extent of the damages it suffered due to Morgan Stanley\u2019s alleged tortious conduct\u201d (45 AD3d 419, 419 [1st Dept 2007]). The majority also concluded that the claims stated valid causes of action and were not time-barred. The Appellate Division granted Morgan Stanley leave to appeal to this Court, certifying the question whether its order was properly made. We answer that question in the negative and reverse.<footnotemark>2</footnotemark></p>\n<p id=\"b230-6\">Although the issue of whether IDT is collaterally estopped from relitigating the amount of its compensatory damages divided the Appellate Division in this case, we need not address it, because all of IDT\u2019s claims are either time-barred or fail to state a cause of action. We conclude that IDT\u2019s breach of fiduciary duty, tortious interference with contract, and misappropriation of confidential and proprietary business information <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"139\">*139</page-number>claims are untimely and its unjust enrichment claim fails to state a cause of action. We address the causes of action in the sequence they appear in the complaint.</p>\n<p id=\"b231-5\">IDT\u2019s first cause of action alleges that Morgan Stanley breached fiduciary duties it owed to IDT, by \u201cproviding] Telefonica with IDT\u2019s confidential and proprietary business and financial information without IDT\u2019s knowledge or consent,\u201d thus inducing Telefonica to renege on the MOU, and by \u201cdevis[ing] a fraudulent scheme to dupe both IDT and the Arbitration Panel as to the \u2018distinction\u2019 between NewCo and Emerg\u00eda and the valuation of these companies.\u201d IDT alleges that the arbitration panel was misled into minimizing the amount of damages Telefonica owed to IDT. It seeks full compensatory damages\u2014in an amount it describes at the outset of its complaint as \u201chundreds of millions of dollars\u201d\u2014as well as disgorgement of profits and punitive damages.</p>\n<p id=\"b231-6\">IDT submits that its breach of fiduciary duty claim is governed by a six-year statute of limitations and is therefore timely. Morgan Stanley asserts that a three-year limitations period applies.</p>\n<p id=\"b231-7\">New York law does not provide a single statute of limitations for breach of fiduciary duty claims. Rather, the choice of the applicable limitations period depends on the substantive remedy that the plaintiff seeks <em>(Loengard v Santa Fe Indus., </em>70 NY2d 262, 266 [1987]). Where the remedy sought is purely monetary in nature, courts construe the suit as alleging \u201cinjury to property\u201d within the meaning of CPLR 214 (4), which has a three-year limitations period (see <em>e.g. Yatter v Morris Agency, </em>256 AD2d 260, 261 [1st Dept 1998]). Where, however, the relief sought is equitable in nature, the six-year limitations period of CPLR 213 (1) applies <em>(Loengard, </em>70 NY2d at 266-267). Moreover, where an allegation of fraud is essential to a breach of fiduciary duty claim, courts have applied a six-year statute of limitations under CPLR 213 (8) <em>(Kaufman v Cohen, </em>307 AD2d 113, 119 [1st Dept 2003]).</p>\n<p id=\"b231-8\">Here, IDT primarily seeks damages\u2014in the amount of \u201chundreds of millions of dollars\u201d\u2014and the equitable relief it seeks, including the disgorgement of profits, is incidental to that relief. This is not an action in which it can reasonably be asserted that \u201cthe relief demanded in the complaint ... is equitable in nature and that a legal remedy would not be adequate\u201d (Loe<em>ngard, </em>70 NY2d at 267). Thus, looking to the <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"140\">*140</page-number>reality, rather than the form, of this action <em>(see Matter of Paver &amp; Wildfoerster [Catholic High School Assn.], </em>38 NY2d 669, 674 [1976]), we conclude that IDT seeks a monetary remedy.</p>\n<p id=\"b232-5\">Moreover, we are not persuaded by IDT\u2019s argument that its breach of fiduciary duty claim is essentially a fraud action and therefore governed by a six-year statute of limitations. The fiduciary relationship alleged by IDT exists between Morgan Stanley and IDT, not between Morgan Stanley and the arbitration panel. For us to conclude that IDT\u2019s breach of fiduciary duty cause of action is a sufficiently pleaded fraud action, we would have to discern a claim that IDT acted in \u201cjustifiable reliance\u201d <em>(Lama Holding Co. v Smith Barney, </em>88 NY2d 413, 421 [1996]) on Morgan Stanley\u2019s alleged misrepresentation or material omission. Although IDT asserts that Morgan Stanley attempted to deceive it in 2000, with regard to the relative values of Emerg\u00eda and NewCo, IDT does not claim that it was actually duped. In fact, IDT refused to accept a modified MOU, contrary to Morgan Stanley\u2019s recommendations. Consequently, we conclude that this is not a fraud allegation, and that the three-year limitations period of CPLR 214 (4) applies.</p>\n<p id=\"b232-6\">We now turn to the question of when IDT\u2019s breach of fiduciary duty claim accrued. A tort claim accrues as soon as \u201cthe claim becomes enforceable, i.e., when all elements of the tort can be truthfully alleged in a complaint\u201d <em>(Kronos, Inc. v AVX Corp., </em>81 NY2d 90, 94 [1993]). As with other torts in which damage is an essential element, the claim \u201cis not enforceable until damages are sustained\u201d <em>(id. </em>at 94). To determine timeliness, we consider whether plaintiff\u2019s complaint must, as a matter of law, be read to allege damages suffered so early as to render the claim time-barred <em>(id. </em>at 94-97). Here, the only reasonable inference to be drawn from IDT\u2019s allegations is that it first suffered loss, as a result of Morgan Stanley\u2019s alleged breach of fiduciary duty, after Telefonica refused to comply with the MOU. The exact date of the injury is not alleged but must have been before May 25, 2001, when IDT commenced the arbitration against Telefonica, alleging that it had sustained a loss of some $3.15 billion as a result of Telefonica\u2019s breach of their binding agreement. More than three years passed, therefore, <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"141\">*141</page-number>before IDT commenced this action, rendering IDT\u2019s breach of fiduciary duty claim time-barred.<footnotemark>3</footnotemark></p>\n<p id=\"b233-5\">Turning to IDT\u2019s second and fourth causes of action<footnotemark>4</footnotemark>\u2014 intentional interference with existing contract and misappropriation of confidential and proprietary business information, respectively\u2014the statute of limitations in each case is three years, under CPLR 214 (4), which the parties do not dispute. As with IDT\u2019s first cause of action, the claims were not enforceable until IDT first suffered damages. The damages are those resulting from Telefonica\u2019s refusal to comply with the MOU\u2014 intransigence that was allegedly induced by Morgan Stanley by means of the disclosure of confidential IDT business information. Again, we must conclude from IDT\u2019s complaint that it first suffered loss\u2014as a result of Morgan Stanley\u2019s alleged interference with contractual relations and misappropriation of confidential business information\u2014when Telefonica refused to comply with the MOU. And again, although the exact date of the injury is not alleged, it must have been before May 25, 2001, rendering the claims time-barred.</p>\n<p id=\"b233-6\">IDT argues that Morgan Stanley\u2019s statute of limitations defenses should be barred by equitable estoppel. However, IDT fails to demonstrate that any action or inaction by Morgan Stanley caused IDT\u2019s delay in bringing this action <em>(see Zumpano v Quinn, </em>6 NY3d 666, 673-676 [2006]). According to its complaint, IDT learned in 2000 that Morgan Stanley was denigrating it in discussions with Telefonica. IDT, given its awareness that Telefonica\u2019s financial adviser had disparaged it, should have made further inquiry before the statute of limitations expired <em>(see Putter v North Shore Univ. Hosp., </em>7 NY3d 548, 553-554 [2006]).</p>\n<p id=\"b233-7\">Finally, IDT alleges that Morgan Stanley was unduly enriched by the investment banking fees it obtained from IDT and from Telefonica \u201cand any other fees Morgan Stanley received for its \u2018search\u2019 for a replacement anchor tenant, as well as any other fees of any kind that Morgan Stanley has earned for additional, presently-unknown misappropriations and misuses of IDT\u2019s confidential business and financial information.\u201d On appeal, Morgan Stanley does not argue that the unjust <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"142\">*142</page-number>enrichment claim is time-barred. Instead it contends that IDT\u2019s fifth claim fails to state a cause of action. We agree.</p>\n<p id=\"b234-4\">\u201cThe theory of unjust enrichment lies as a quasi-contract claim\u201d <em>(Goldman v Metropolitan Life Ins. Co., </em>5 NY3d 561, 572 [2005]). It is an obligation imposed by equity to prevent injustice, in the absence of an actual agreement between the parties concerned. Where the parties executed a valid and enforceable written contract governing a particular subject matter, recovery on a theory of unjust enrichment for events arising out of that subject matter is ordinarily precluded <em>(Clark-Fitzpatrick, Inc. v Long Is. R.R. Co., </em>70 NY2d 382, 388 [1987]).</p>\n<p id=\"b234-5\">It follows that the unjust enrichment claim cannot form the basis of IDT\u2019s demand that Morgan Stanley return the $10,000,000 fee paid in relation to the Net2Phone, Inc. transaction, because that fee arose from services governed by an engagement letter signed by IDT on July 26, 2000.<footnotemark>5</footnotemark> Nor can the unjust enrichment claim support the disgorgement of any profits Morgan Stanley obtained from Telefonica or other companies, in connection with SAm-1. An unjust enrichment claim \u201crests upon the equitable principle that a person shall not be allowed to enrich himself unjustly at the expense of another\u201d <em>(Miller v Schloss, </em>218 NY 400, 407 [1916]; <em>see also </em>Restatement [First] of Restitution \u00a7 1). In seeking Morgan Stanley\u2019s profits from SAm-1, IDT does not, and cannot, allege that Morgan Stanley has been unjustly enriched at IDT\u2019s expense, because IDT did not pay the alleged fees.</p>\n<p id=\"b234-6\">Accordingly, the order of the Appellate Division should be reversed, with costs, defendants\u2019 motion to dismiss the remaining causes of action granted, the complaint dismissed in the entirety, and the certified question answered in the negative.</p>\n<p id=\"b234-7\">Judges Ciparick, Graffeo, Read, Smith and Jones concur; Chief Judge Lippman taking no part.</p>\n<p id=\"b234-8\">Order reversed, etc.</p>\n<footnote label=\"1\">\n<p id=\"b229-8\">. The panel rejected IDT\u2019s contention that NewCo and Emerg\u00eda were one and the same. Rather, it found, NewCo was envisaged as a company holding the infrastructure assets of SAm-1, and did not encompass the marketing function and revenues of the enterprise. In reaching this conclusion, the arbitration panel relied on, among other things, minutes of a July 2000 IDT board meeting, indicating that IDT recognized that Emerg\u00eda was a larger enterprise, with greater growth potential, than NewCo. The arbitration panel expressed skepticism about Morgan Stanley\u2019s summer 2000 valuation of NewCo and Emerg\u00eda, noting that its projections were \u201cprepared by Telefonica and Morgan Stanley to be presented to IDT as part of the process of negotiating IDT\u2019s ownership percentage in Emerg\u00eda.\u201d</p>\n</footnote>\n<footnote label=\"2\">\n<p id=\"b230-7\">. After Supreme Court denied the motion to dismiss, the parties proceeded to discovery and Morgan Stanley produced documents that, according to IDT, reveal further wrongdoing by Morgan Stanley during the arbitration proceeding. IDT filed an amended complaint. Supreme Court granted Morgan Stanley\u2019s motion to dismiss the new claims. That decision is under appeal.</p>\n<p id=\"b230-8\">In June 2008, IDT moved to dismiss the present appeal as moot, on the ground that the original complaint had been significantly amended. We denied the mootness motion on September 4, 2008 (11 NY3d 750 [2008]).</p>\n</footnote>\n<footnote label=\"3\">\n<p id=\"b233-8\">. Morgan Stanley contends that the breach of fiduciary duty claim fails on the merits, because there was no fiduciary relationship between IDT and Morgan Stanley on the transaction in suit, but this too is a question we need not reach because the claim, even if meritorious, is time-barred.</p>\n</footnote>\n<footnote label=\"4\">\n<p id=\"b233-9\">. IDT did not appeal Supreme Court\u2019s dismissal of its third claim.</p>\n</footnote>\n<footnote label=\"5\">\n<p id=\"b234-9\">. IDT\u2019s argument that it engaged Morgan Stanley under duress is unpersuasive, in that the coercion by Morgan Stanley that IDT alleged in its complaint occurred after IDT refused to pay the fee, not before the fee was agreed on.</p>\n</footnote>\n</opinion>\n</casebody>\n",
