The pertinent facts of this case are recited below.</p>\n<p id=\"b404-3\"><page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"312\">*312</page-number>Plaintiff Jesus Fuentes and his wife were divorced in 1996. Family Court entered an order granting the wife exclusive custody of the three children, including a son, M.F., who, due to a genetic disorder, was legally blind. M.F. attended public school in New York City and received special education services to accommodate his disability.</p>\n<p id=\"b404-4\">In 2000, plaintiff believed that M.F.\u2019s special education services and accommodations were inadequate and requested a reevaluation. When the Committee on Special Education for the Hearing, Handicapped, and Visually Impaired responded that M.F\u2019s services were adequate, plaintiff requested a hearing from the Impartial Hearing Office of the New York City Board of Education to review that determination. In 2001, plaintiffs request for a hearing was denied based on his status as the noncustodial parent of M.F. The Office concluded that because plaintiff was not the \u201cperson in parental relation\u201d (Education Law \u00a7 3212), he did not have the right to make educational decisions pertaining to M.F. and, consequently, did not have a right to request a hearing.</p>\n<p id=\"b404-5\">Plaintiff then commenced an action in the United States District Court for the Eastern District of New York alleging, among other things, that he was denied his right under the federal Individuals with Disabilities Education Act (IDEA) to a hearing to review the determinations of the Board of Education. After a dismissal, appeal, and remand on issues not pertinent to the certified question, the District Court dismissed plaintiffs case for lack of standing under the IDEA. On appeal, the United States Court of Appeals for the Second Circuit found that no precedent from this Court directly addressed the dispositive issue and certified the following question:</p>\n<blockquote id=\"b404-6\">\u201cWhether, under New York law, the biological and non-custodial parent of a child retains the right to participate in decisions pertaining to the education of the child where (1) the custodial parent is granted exclusive custody of the child and (2) the divorce decree and custody order are silent as to the right to control such decisions\u201d <em>(Fuentes v Board of Educ. of City of N.Y., </em>540 F3d 145, 153 [2d Cir 2008]).</blockquote>\n<p id=\"b404-7\">The purpose of the IDEA is to provide \u201call children with disabilities\u201d with a \u201cfree appropriate public education\u201d (20 USC \u00a7 1400 [d] [1] [A]). Such an education must include \u201cspecial <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"313\">*313</page-number>education and related services\u201d designed to meet the particular needs of the child (20 USC \u00a7 1401 [9]). A qualifying child\u2019s educational needs \u201cand the services required to meet those needs must be set forth at least annually in a written individualized education plan (TEP\u2019)\u201d <em>(M.C. ex rel. Mrs. C. v Voluntown Bd. of Educ., </em>226 F3d 60, 62 [2d Cir 2000]). A \u201cparent\u201d who is dissatisfied with an IEP \u201cmay file a complaint with the state or local educational agency,\u201d to be resolved through a due process hearing <em>(id. </em>at 62-63).</p>\n<p id=\"b405-5\">The Second Circuit previously discussed a noncustodial parent\u2019s rights under the IDEA in <em>Taylor v Vermont Dept. of Educ. </em>(313 F3d 768 [2d Cir 2002]). In <em>Taylor, </em>a noncustodial parent demanded a hearing under the IDEA even though her Vermont divorce decree expressly provided that the custodial parent was \u201c allocate[d] all legal rights and physical rights regarding the choice of schooling for the child\u201d <em>(id. </em>at 772). The court concluded that the federal statutory scheme required the courts to turn to state law \u201cto establish which potential parent has authority to make special education decisions for the child\u201d <em>(id. </em>at 779). Applying Vermont law, the court held that the noncustodial parent lacked standing to request a hearing under the IDEA because her \u201cparental right to participate in her daughter\u2019s education has been revoked by a Vermont family court\u201d <em>(id. </em>at 782).</p>\n<p id=\"b405-6\">This case presents an issue unanswered by Taylor\u2014namely, whether a noncustodial parent has the right to initiate a hearing under the IDEA where the New York divorce decree and custody order grant exclusive custody to the custodial parent but are silent as to who has the authority to make decisions concerning the child\u2019s education. In <em>Weiss v Weiss </em>(52 NY2d 170 [1981]), a Judge of this Court first alluded to the principle that a custodial parent has the right, absent controlling contrary provisions in a separation agreement, to determine the child\u2019s secular and religious education programs <em>(id. </em>at 177 [Meyer, J., concurring]). It is now well settled in the Appellate Division that, absent specific provisions in a separation agreement, custody order, or divorce decree, the custodial parent has sole decision-making authority with respect to practically all aspects of the child\u2019s upbringing <em>(see e.g. Matter of Fedash v Neilsen, </em>211 AD2d 1003 [3d Dept 1995]; <em>Matter of De Luca v De Luca, </em>202 AD2d 580 [2d Dept 1994]; <em>De Beer v De Beer, </em>162 AD2d 165 [1st Dept 1990]; <em>Stevenot v Stevenot, </em>133 AD2d 820 [2d Dept 1987]; <em>Bliss v Ach, </em>86 AD2d 575 [1st Dept 1982]).</p>\n<p id=\"b406-4\"><page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"314\">*314</page-number>In appropriate circumstances, courts routinely include specific provisions in custody orders addressing decision-making authority between the parents <em>(see e.g. Wideman v Wideman, </em>38 AD3d 1318 [4th Dept 2007]; <em>Chamberlain v Chamberlain, </em>24 AD3d 589 [2d Dept 2005]; <em>Matter of Davis v Davis, </em>240 AD2d 928 [3d Dept 1997]). Plaintiff asks this Court to recognize an implied right of noncustodial parents to exercise decision-making authority with respect to their child\u2019s education notwithstanding the custody order\u2019s silence on this subject. We decline to do so and emphasize the importance of parties determining these issues at the time of separation or divorce.</p>\n<p id=\"b406-5\">Finally, we note the distinction between a noncustodial parent\u2019s right to \u201cparticipate\u201d in a child\u2019s education and the right to \u201ccontrol\u201d educational decisions. Generally, there is nothing which prevents a noncustodial parent (even one without any decision-making authority) from requesting information about, keeping apprised of, or otherwise remaining interested in the child\u2019s educational progress. Such parental involvement is to be encouraged. However, unless the custody order expressly permits joint decision-making authority or designates particular authority with respect to the child\u2019s education, a noncustodial parent has no right to \u201ccontrol\u201d such decisions. This authority properly belongs to the custodial parent. In light of our discussion, we see fit to reformulate the certified question to read as follows:</p>\n<blockquote id=\"b406-6\">\u201cWhether, under New York law, the non-custodial parent of a child retains decision-making authority pertaining to the education of the child where (1) the custodial parent is granted exclusive custody of the child and (2) the divorce decree and custody order are silent as to the right to control such decisions.\u201d</blockquote>\n<p id=\"b406-7\">Accordingly, as reformulated, the certified question should be answered in the negative.</p>\n<p id=\"b406-8\">Judges Ciparick, Graffeo, Read, Smith and Pigott concur; Chief Judge Lippman taking no part.</p>\n<p id=\"b406-9\">Following certification of a question by the United States Court of Appeals for the Second Circuit and acceptance of the question by this Court pursuant to section 500.27 of the Rules of Practice of the Court of Appeals (22 NYCRR 500.27), and after hearing argument by counsel for the parties and</p>\n<p id=\"b407-4\"><page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"315\">*315</page-number>consideration of the briefs and the record submitted, certified question, as reformulated, answered in the negative.</p>\n</opinion>\n</casebody>\n",
