The dissent below disagreed on the issue of duplicity only with respect to the second count <em>(id. </em>at 320). We agree with the majority below and now affirm.</p>\n<p id=\"b246-11\">CPL 200.30 (1) provides that \u201c[e]ach count of an indictment may charge one offense only.\u201d As this Court explained in <em>People v Keindl </em>(68 NY2d 410 [1986]), \u201cacts which separately and individually make out distinct crimes must be charged in separate and distinct counts, and where one count alleges the commission of a particular offense occurring repeatedly during a designated period of time, that count encompasses more than one offense and is duplicitous\u201d <em>(id. </em>at 417-418 [citations omitted]). Compliance with CPL 200.30 (1) is essential because \u201c[t]he prohibition against duplicity furthers not only the func<page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"155\">*155</page-number>tions of notice to a defendant and of assurance against double jeopardy, but also ensures the reliability of the unanimous verdict\u201d <em>(id. </em>at 418).</p>\n<p id=\"b247-5\">Here, the second count of the indictment was pleaded in a manner which made it duplicitous. This count, alleging 11 incidents over an eight-month period, encompassed \u201csuch a multiplicity of acts ... as to make it virtually impossible to determine the particular act of [assault] ... as to which [a] jury [could] reach[ ] a unanimous verdict\u201d <em>(id. </em>at 421). The first count is similarly defective. Were these counts to stand as pleaded, \u201cindividual jurors might vote to convict . . . defendant^] of [each] count on the basis of different offenses\u201d and \u201cdefendant^] would thus stand convicted under [each] count even though the jury may never have reached a unanimous verdict as to any one of the offenses\u201d <em>(id. </em>at 418).</p>\n<p id=\"b247-6\">Our decision in this case is not inconsistent with the People\u2019s argument that depraved indifference assault can be a continuing crime and that the element of depravity can be alleged by establishing that defendant engaged in a course of conduct over a period of time. Notwithstanding this point, the indictment in this case was defectively pleaded and properly dismissed. The conclusion of the dissenting Justices below that April 7, 2005 should be the date \u201con which defendants\u2019 conduct resulted in serious physical injury and a grave risk of death\u201d (51 AD3d at 323) does not salvage the second count because setting this date amounts to an improper amendment to the indictment.</p>\n<p id=\"b247-7\">Our dissenting colleagues are of the view that some or all of defendants\u2019 acts\u2014and not any single act\u2014could have created the grave risk of death and the jury could unanimously agree on this before convicting defendants of depraved indifference assault. However, the People\u2019s use of the conjunction \u201cand/or\u201d between each act undercuts this position. Despite the possibility that a jury could find that the entire course of conduct created a grave risk of death, given the \u201cand/or\u201d language, a jury could just as easily find that defendants committed only one of the alleged acts; not only would a single act not be sufficient to establish a course of conduct but we still would not know on which particular act defendants were convicted.</p>\n<p id=\"b247-8\">In addition, the dissent, citing <em>People v Suarez </em>(6 NY3d 202 [2005]), analogizes the pleading of depraved indifference murder to that of depraved indifference assault and argues that \u201cthe only distinction between those crimes is that, under the <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"156\">*156</page-number>former, the conduct must cause the death of another person as opposed to serious physical injury\u201d (dissenting op at 157). We believe that the injury element is the precise point which distinguishes these crimes for the purpose of a duplicity analysis. Where the resulting injury is \u201cdeath of another person\u201d (Penal Law \u00a7 125.25 [2]), regardless of how many acts are alleged in a single count, there can always only be one completed offense\u2014 the victim can only die once. However, where, as here, the injury is \u201cserious physical injury to another person\u201d (Penal Law \u00a7 120.10 [3]), there can be (and might well have been in this case) multiple instances of serious physical injury and, consequently, multiple completed offenses.</p>\n<p id=\"b248-5\">Accordingly, the order of the Appellate Division should be affirmed.</p>\n<p id=\"b248-6\">Pigott, J. (dissenting in part). Although I agree with the majority that depraved indifference assault can be a continuing offense, I respectfully dissent because, in my view, the majority\u2019s conclusion that count two \u201cwas pleaded in a manner which made it duplicitous\u201d is inconsistent with its later statement \u201cdepraved indifference assault can be a continuing crime\u201d (majority op at 155).</p>\n<p id=\"b248-7\">A person is guilty of depraved indifference assault in the first degree when, \u201c[ujnder circumstances evincing a depraved indifference to human life, he recklessly engages in conduct which creates a grave risk of death to another person, and thereby causes serious physical injury to another person\u201d (Penal Law \u00a7 120.10 [3]). Count two of this indictment lists the elements of that offense and then identifies the multiple acts allegedly engaged in by defendants while acting in concert. In my view, contrary to the majority\u2019s opinion, the pleading of multiple acts under this one count does not threaten the reliability of a unanimous verdict, because it is defendants\u2019 course of conduct, and whether that conduct is deemed to be reckless and to have created a grave risk of death\u2014and not any singular act\u2014upon which the jury must unanimously agree before defendants may be convicted of depraved indifference assault. Therefore, unlike the multiple intentional assault allegations charged in count one\u2014which are indeed duplicative\u2014it is the alleged multiple acts of defendants, over a period of eight months, that support count two, because some or all of those acts, if proven, could lead a jury to conclude that defendants\u2019 conduct created a grave risk of death, resulting in serious physical injury to the victim.</p>\n<p id=\"b249-4\"><page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"157\">*157</page-number>In a related context, in <em>People v Suarez </em>(6 NY3d 202 [2005]), we stated that depraved indifference murder is \u201cestablished when a defendant\u2014acting with a conscious objective not to kill but to harm\u2014engages in torture or a brutal, prolonged and ultimately fatal course of conduct against a particularly vulnerable victim\u201d <em>(Suarez, </em>6 NY3d at 212). Clearly, if more than one act may be alleged within the parameters of a depraved indifference murder count, so too may more than one act be alleged with respect to the crime of depraved indifference assault, because the only distinction between those crimes is that, under the former, the conduct must cause the death of another person as opposed to serious physical injury. Had the victim died in this case, under our jurisprudence, the People would have been able to allege multiple acts in a depraved indifference murder count. The same result should follow here.</p>\n<p id=\"b249-5\">In my view, the indictment sufficiently alleges that on April 7, 2005, the conduct of defendants had \u201cresulted in serious physical injury and a grave risk of death\u201d <em>(People v Bauman, </em>51 AD3d 316, 323 [4th Dept 2008, Fahey, J., dissenting in part]), because it was at that time that the victim is alleged to have been found by emergency personnel in a hypothermic condition and near death.</p>\n<p id=\"b249-6\">Based on the foregoing, I would modify the order of the Appellate Division by reinstating the second count and would otherwise affirm.</p>\n<p id=\"b249-7\">Chief Judge Lippman and Judges Ciparick, Graffeo and Read concur with Judge Jones; Judge Pigott dissents in part and votes to modify in a separate opinion in which Judge Smith concurs.</p>\n<p id=\"b249-8\">Order affirmed.</p>\n</opinion>\n</casebody>\n",
