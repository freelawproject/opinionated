We therefore affirm the order of the Appellate Division so holding.</p>\n<p id=\"b735-6\">In 2003, defendant Presstek, Inc. and its wholly owned subsidiary, defendant Silver Acquisitions Corp., entered into discussions to purchase A.B. Dick Company (ABD)\u2014a financially distressed graphic arts and printing supplier\u2014from its parent corporation, Paragon Corporate Holdings, Inc. The negotiations culminated in a June 2004 stock purchase agreement, which provided that Paragon would receive $24 million in cash and approximately $20 million worth of Presstek\u2019s stock in exchange for ABD\u2019s stock. Under an ancillary agreement incorporated into the stock purchase agreement, plaintiffs MHR Capital Partners LP and its affiliates (collectively, MHR)\u2014major creditors of ABD\u2014agreed to the terms of the stock purchase arrangement and waived their rights in return for the payment of over $10 million in cash and stock from Presstek.</p>\n<p id=\"b735-7\">On June 16, 2004, Presstek, Silver, ABD, Paragon and MHR executed a separate escrow agreement that required the stock purchase agreement and related documents to be placed in escrow and released upon the occurrence of certain conditions. Specifically, the escrowed materials were not to be released \u201cunless and until\u201d Key Corporate Capital, Inc. (Key Bank), ABD\u2019s lender, consented to the stock purchase transaction \u201con the terms and conditions contained herein.\u201d Further, the escrow agreement obligated Paragon to obtain Key Bank\u2019s approval before \u201cthe close of business on June 22, 2004,\u201d together with the bank\u2019s execution of a consent form annexed to the escrow agreement. The escrow agreement stated that Presstek was to destroy or return the escrowed documents deemed \u201cnull and void\u201d if Key Bank did not sign the consent form by June 22.</p>\n<p id=\"b735-8\">In the consent document, Presstek agreed to satisfy ABD\u2019s outstanding indebtedness with a combination of cash and Presstek stock (rather than cash only) and Key Bank was required both to continue funding ABD \u201cby increasing its total aggregate lending commitment to [Paragon] as necessary to ensure adequate funding for [ABD] through the closing\u201d and forbear from declaring any default under its loan agreement <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"644\">*644</page-number>with ABD until the deal closed. Key Bank, however, refused to execute the consent form. Instead, on June 22, 2004, Key Bank faxed a one-page letter to Presstek that \u201cconsent[ed]\u201d to the transaction, but included terms that differed from some of the requirements in the consent form. In particular, Key Bank did not consent to fund ABD \u201cas necessary,\u201d nor did it agree not to declare a default. Presstek terminated the stock purchase transaction later that day.</p>\n<p id=\"b736-5\">The following month, Presstek and Silver entered into a more lucrative asset purchase agreement with ABD and Paragon. The new agreement contained no provision for Presstek\u2019s satisfaction of ABD\u2019s outstanding indebtedness to MHR. As required by this new agreement, ABD filed for bankruptcy in Delaware. Paragon applied to the United States Bankruptcy Court for the District of Delaware for an order authorizing the sale of ABD\u2019s assets to Presstek pursuant to an auction process that would allow third parties to offer higher bids. MHR filed objections to the auction sale of ABD\u2019s assets on the basis that Presstek and Silver were not \u201cgood faith\u201d purchasers within the meaning of 11 USC \u00a7 363 (m).</p>\n<p id=\"b736-6\">After an evidentiary hearing, the Bankruptcy Court overruled MHR\u2019s objections and approved the sale. The United States District Court for the District of Delaware dismissed MHR\u2019s appeal as moot because MHR had failed to seek a stay. The District Court also noted that, in any event, Presstek\u2019s pre-bankruptcy proceeding behavior had no bearing on whether it was a good faith purchaser under the Bankruptcy Code.<footnotemark>1</footnotemark></p>\n<p id=\"b736-7\">In February 2005, MHR commenced this action for breach of contract against Presstek and Silver, alleging that they improperly terminated the stock purchase agreement.<footnotemark>2</footnotemark> The complaint seeks $14 million in damages. Following discovery, Presstek moved for summary judgment dismissing the complaint.</p>\n<p id=\"b736-8\">Supreme Court granted the motion and dismissed the complaint, concluding that the Bankruptcy Court\u2019s approval of the sale of ABD\u2019s assets over MHR\u2019s objections precluded this breach of contract action under principles of res judicata and collateral estoppel <em>(see </em>2007 NY Slip Op 32322[U]). The <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"645\">*645</page-number>Appellate Division, with two Justices dissenting, affirmed, albeit on a different ground (55 AD3d 12 [1st Dept 2008]). The majority held that Key Bank\u2019s failure to sign the consent form by June 22, 2004, which it characterized as a condition precedent, relieved Presstek of any obligation to close under the stock purchase agreement. The dissent would have reinstated the complaint, finding an issue of fact as to whether Presstek had improperly prevented Key Bank from executing the consent form. MHR appeals as of right based on the two-Justice dissent pursuant to CPLR 5601 (a).</p>\n<p id=\"b737-5\">MHR urges three grounds for reversal and reinstatement of its breach of contract claim. First, MHR contends that the escrow agreement is ambiguous and that Key Bank\u2019s approval was not a condition precedent. In a related vein, MHR argues that Key Bank\u2019s June 22 fax was an adequate approval and that any differences in terms between the consent form and fax are immaterial. Second, MHR submits that the consent form improperly added conditions not contemplated by the stock purchase agreement. Third, MHR asserts that, even if Key Bank\u2019s approval of the transaction was a condition precedent, a question of fact exists as to whether Presstek actively interfered with Key Bank\u2019s execution of the consent form.</p>\n<p id=\"b737-6\">It is well settled that a contract is to be construed in accordance with the parties\u2019 intent, which is generally discerned from the four corners of the document itself. Consequently, <em>\u201ca </em>written agreement that is complete, clear and unambiguous on its face must be enforced according to the plain meaning of its terms\u201d <em>(Greenfield v Philles Records, </em>98 NY2d 562, 569 [2002]). Furthermore, a condition precedent is \u201can act or event, other than a lapse of time, which, unless the condition is excused, must occur before a duty to perform a promise in the agreement arises\u201d <em>(Oppenheimer &amp; Co. v Oppenheim, Appel, Dixon &amp; Co., </em>86 NY2d 685, 690 [1995] [internal quotation marks and citations omitted]). We have recognized that the use of terms such as \u201cif,\u201d \u201cunless\u201d and \u201cuntil\u201d constitutes \u201cunmistakable language of condition\u201d <em>(id. </em>at 691). Express conditions must be literally performed; substantial performance will not suffice.</p>\n<p id=\"b737-7\">Here, pursuant to the escrow agreement, the contract documents were not to be released \u201cunless and until\u201d Key Bank consented to the deal \u201con the terms and conditions\u201d outlined in the agreement. Among those terms and conditions was the requirement that Key Bank manifest its approval through its execution of the accompanying consent form by June 22, 2004. <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"646\">*646</page-number>Upon the failure of Key Bank to accept the terms of the consent form by that date, Presstek was authorized to destroy or return the stock purchase agreement and annexed documents, all of which then became \u201cnull and void.\u201d Based on this clear and unambiguous language, we conclude that Key Bank\u2019s approval of the stock purchase transaction by the fixed date\u2014through its execution of the consent form\u2014was an express condition precedent.</p>\n<p id=\"b738-5\">It is uncontested that Key Bank did not sign the consent form. Moreover, Key Bank\u2019s June 22 fax, presenting a more limited acceptance, did not fulfill the explicit requirement that Key Bank execute and agree to all of the terms contained in the consent form, as required by the escrow agreement. Hence, Key Bank did not perform the express condition.</p>\n<p id=\"b738-6\">To the extent MHR complains that the consent form imposed additional burdens on Key Bank not originally contemplated by the stock purchase agreement, we concur with the Appellate Division majority\u2019s view that MHR\u2019s time to voice its displeasure with the wording and requirements of the documents expired when it accepted and signed the escrow agreement. Each of the parties to the escrow agreement, including MHR, was a sophisticated business entity represented by counsel, and the agreement, negotiated at arm\u2019s length, incorporated the annexed consent form and plainly required Key Bank to sign it (see <em>generally Innophos, Inc. v Rhodia, S.A., </em>10 NY3d 25, 29 [2008]). That the consent form obligated Key Bank to refrain from declaring a default and increase its lending commitment to Paragon \u201cas necessary to ensure adequate funding\u201d\u2014requirements viewed in hindsight as overly burdensome by MHR\u2014is therefore irrelevant.</p>\n<p id=\"b738-7\">Finally, MHR correctly observes that a \u201cparty to a contract cannot rely on the failure of another to perform a condition precedent where he has frustrated or prevented the occurrence of the condition\u201d (ADC <em>Orange, Inc. v Coyote Acres, Inc., </em>7 NY3d 484, 490 [2006] [internal quotation marks and citation omitted]). But MHR failed to raise a question of fact in this regard. Critically, the escrow agreement placed the burden on Paragon\u2014 not Presstek\u2014to obtain Key Bank\u2019s consent by June 22. Nevertheless, Presstek met with Key Bank\u2019s representative before that date and at that time Key Bank had the consent form in its possession, but refused to sign it on the basis that it considered its terms too onerous. The fact that Presstek entered into a more favorable arrangement to buy ABD\u2019s assets shortly after <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"647\">*647</page-number>the stock purchase transaction fell apart does not, by itself, raise an issue of fact as to whether it prevented Key Bank from signing the consent form.</p>\n<p id=\"b739-5\">Because we agree with the Appellate Division majority that Presstek had no duty to proceed with the stock purchase agreement due to the nonperformance of an express condition, namely, Key Bank\u2019s failure to execute the consent form, we do not reach Presstek\u2019s alternative grounds for affirmance.</p>\n<p id=\"b739-6\">Accordingly, the order of the Appellate Division should be affirmed, with costs.</p>\n<p id=\"b739-7\">Chief Judge Lippman and Judges Ciparick, Read, Smith, Pigott and Jones concur.</p>\n<p id=\"b739-8\">Order affirmed, with costs.</p>\n<footnote label=\"1\">\n<p id=\"b736-9\">. According to MHR, it received only $175,000 for its ABD notes as a result of the bankruptcy proceeding.</p>\n</footnote>\n<footnote label=\"2\">\n<p id=\"b736-10\">. Supreme Court dismissed the complaint as against Silver for lack of personal jurisdiction.</p>\n</footnote>\n</opinion>\n</casebody>\n",
