Under 11 NYCRR 65-4.6 (e), a prevailing assignee medical provider in a no-fault action is entitled to one attorney\u2019s fee with respect to all claims asserted in the action on behalf of a single assignor, to be calculated based on the total amount of first-party benefits awarded by the court in connection with such claims, and is not entitled to multiple attorney\u2019s fees on a \u201cper claim\u201d basis. <em>(U.S. Underwriters Ins.

Plaintiffs asserted one cause of action for each insured treated, alleging that State Farm failed to pay or deny multiple bills within the requisite 30 days.</p>\n<p id=\"b313-6\">Plaintiffs were granted summary judgment awarding them, among other things, attorneys\u2019 fees and interest. As relevant to this appeal, attorneys\u2019 fees were awarded \u201con each claim within each cause of action\u201d; in other words, attorneys\u2019 fees were calculated on each bill submitted for each insured. This amount differed substantially from that proposed by State Farm, which sought a calculation of attorneys\u2019 fees on a per insured basis.</p>\n<p id=\"b313-7\">In addition, Supreme Court awarded plaintiffs interest at the statutory rate of 2% per month, without applying the tolling provision set forth in the Insurance Department regulations, which provide for the suspension of interest 30 days after denial of payment until plaintiffs commence an action seeking payment.</p>\n<p id=\"b313-8\">On appeal, the Appellate Division rejected State Farm\u2019s contention that Supreme Court failed to properly apply the tolling provision in awarding interest to plaintiffs (46 AD3d 1290 [2007] ). The court held that because State Farm did not issue a proper and timely denial to plaintiffs\u2019 no-fault claims, it was not entitled to the benefit of the tolling provision.</p>\n<p id=\"b313-10\">As it pertained to attorneys\u2019 fees, the court held that Supreme Court properly awarded fees on a per bill basis rather than a per insured basis. The court expressly rejected an opinion letter of the Superintendent of Insurance, finding it in conflict with the express language of Insurance Law \u00a7 5106, as well as case law. This Court granted defendant leave to appeal (10 NY3d 717 [2008] ) and we now reverse.</p>\n<p id=\"b313-12\">\u201cNew York\u2019s no-fault automobile insurance system is designed \u2018to ensure prompt compensation for losses incurred by accident victims without regard to fault or negligence, to reduce the burden on the courts and to provide substantial premium savings to New York motorists\u2019 \u201d <em>(Hospital for Joint Diseases v Travelers Prop. Cas. Ins. Co., </em>9 NY3d 312, 317 [2007] [citation <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"222\">*222</page-number>omitted]). We recently reiterated that the no-fault scheme\u2019s core objective is \u201cto provide a tightly timed process of claim, disputation and payment\u201d <em>(id. </em>at 319, quoting <em>Presbyterian Hosp. in City of N.Y. v Maryland Cas. Co., </em>90 NY2d 274, 281 [1997]). In furtherance of this objective, an insurer\u2019s failure to pay or deny a claim within the requisite time period carries significant consequences, including the payment of attorneys\u2019 fees and interest.</p>\n<p id=\"b314-5\">Insurance Law \u00a7 5106 (a) provides that \u201c[if] a valid claim or portion was overdue, the claimant shall ... be entitled to recover his attorney\u2019s reasonable fee, for services necessarily performed in connection with securing payment of the overdue claim . . . .\u201d Pursuant to the authority delegated to him by section 5106 (a), the Superintendent of Insurance promulgated regulation 11 NYCRR 65-4.6 establishing a minimum attorneys\u2019 fee and further providing that the. \u201cattorney\u2019s fee shall be limited as follows: 20 percent of the amount of first-party benefits, plus interest thereon, awarded by the . . . court, subject to a maximum fee of $850\u201d (11 NYCRR 65-4.6 [e]).</p>\n<p id=\"b314-6\">On October 8, 2003, the Superintendent issued an opinion letter interpreting that regulation and stating that the minimum amount of attorneys\u2019 fees awarded to an assignee health care provider pursuant to Insurance Law \u00a7 5106 is</p>\n<blockquote id=\"b314-7\">\u201cbased upon the aggregate amount of payment required to be reimbursed based upon the amount awarded for each bill which had been submitted and denied. The minimum attorney fee ... is not due and owing for each bill submitted as part of the total amount of the disputed claim sought in the court action\u201d (Ops Gen Counsel NY Ins Dept No. 03-10-04 [Oct. 2003]).</blockquote>\n<p id=\"b314-8\">In referring to the regulations, specifically 11 NYCRR 65-4.6 (e), the Superintendent stated:</p>\n<blockquote id=\"b314-9\">\u201c[That provision] makes it clear that the amount of attorney\u2019s fees awarded will be based upon 20% of the total amount of first party benefits awarded. That total amount is derived from the total amount of individual bills disputed in either a court action or arbitration, regardless of whether one bill or multiple bills are presented as part of a total claim for benefits, based upon the health services rendered by a provider to the same eligible insured\u201d <em>(id.).</em></blockquote>\n<p id=\"b315-4\"><page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"223\">*223</page-number>We have long held that the Superintendent\u2019s \u201cinterpretation, if not irrational or unreasonable, will be upheld in deference to his special competence and expertise with respect to the insurance industry, unless it runs counter to the clear wording of a statutory provision\u201d <em>(Matter of New York Pub. Interest Research Group v New York State Dept. of Ins., </em>66 NY2d 444, 448 [1985]). The responsibility for administering the Insurance Law and, in particular, fair claims settlement under the No-Fault Law rests with the Superintendent <em>(see </em>Insurance Law \u00a7\u00a7 301, 5106 [a]). For purposes of calculating attorneys\u2019 fees, the Superintendent has interpreted a claim to be the total medical expenses claimed in a cause of action pertaining to a single insured, and not\u2014as the courts below held\u2014each separate medical bill submitted by the provider. Because this interpretation is neither irrational, unreasonable, nor counter to the clear wording of the statute, it is entitled to deference. Thus, this Court accepts the Insurance Department\u2019s interpretation of its own regulation and, upon remittitur, directs Supreme Court to calculate attorneys\u2019 fees based on the aggregate of all bills for each insured.</p>\n<p id=\"b315-5\">State Farm next contends that the Appellate Division erred in finding that an insurance company that fails to issue a proper and timely denial is not entitled to the benefit of the tolling provision. We agree.</p>\n<p id=\"b315-6\">Pursuant to Insurance Law \u00a7 5106 (a), interest accrues on overdue no-fault insurance claims at a rate of 2% per month. A claim is overdue when it is not paid within 30 days after a proper demand is made for its payment (Insurance Law \u00a7 5106 [a]; 11 NYCRR 65.15 [g]). The Superintendent\u2019s regulation tolls the accumulation of interest if the claimant \u201cdoes not request arbitration or institute a lawsuit within 30 days after the receipt of a denial of claim form or payment of benefits calculated pursuant to Insurance Department regulations\u201d (11 NYCRR 65-3.9 [c]).</p>\n<p id=\"b315-7\">The Superintendent has interpreted this provision to mandate that the accrual of interest is tolled, regardless of whether the particular denial at issue was timely. That interpretation is similarly entitled to deference given that it is \u201cnot irrational or unreasonable\u201d <em>(Matter of Council of City of N.Y. v Public Serv. Commn. of State of N.Y., </em>99 NY2d 64, 74 [2002]). Indeed, it is consistent with section 5106, entitled \u201cFair claims settlement,\u201d the purpose of which is to encourage claimants to swiftly seek to resolve any dispute concerning their entitlement to no-fault benefits. Once a denial is issued, even if an untimely one, a <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"224\">*224</page-number>claimant should still be encouraged to act to resolve the dispute quickly. Supreme Court is therefore directed to calculate appropriate interest on each claim, taking into consideration the tolling provision of section 5106 (a) as interpreted by the Superintendent of Insurance.</p>\n<p id=\"b316-5\">Accordingly, the order of the Appellate Division, insofar as appealed from, should be reversed, with costs, and the matter remitted to Supreme Court for further proceedings in accordance with this opinion.</p>\n<p id=\"b316-6\">Judges Ciparick, Graffeo, Read, Smith and Jones concur; Chief Judge Lippman taking no part.</p>\n<p id=\"b316-7\">Order, insofar as appealed from, reversed, etc.</p>\n</opinion>\n</casebody>\n",
