LCDC leases the property to a for-profit corporation that carries out for-profit manufacturing activities on the property. The Appellate Division found the property taxable under the Real Property Tax Law (50 AD3d 1469 [4th Dept 2008]). Because the property is \u201cused\u201d within the meaning of RPTL 420-a (1) (a) by the for-profit lessee for manufacturing activities, and not by LCDC for an exempt purpose, we hold that the property is taxable and the Appellate Division order should be affirmed.</p>\n<p id=\"b672-8\">LCDC acquired the properties that comprise what is now known as 100 Ridge Road in Lackawanna, New York between 1981 and 1985, and in 1993 LCDC leased the real property to Now-Tech Industries, Inc., a for-profit corporation. Now-Tech <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"581\">*581</page-number>Industries, Inc. subsequently assigned the lease to PCB Now-Tech, Inc., another for-profit corporation. Prior to 2006, LCDC was not assessed real property taxes on the 100 Ridge Road property. In 2006, relying on the New York State Office of Real Property Services Exemption Administration Manual that, in relevant part, largely mirrors the statute, Lackawanna\u2019s tax assessor concluded that the 100 Ridge Road property was not entitled to an exemption under section 420-a (1) (a), and LCDC commenced this action.</p>\n<p id=\"b673-4\">\u201cGenerally, the burden of proof lies with the taxpayer who is seeking to have real property declared tax exempt,\u201d but when, as here, a municipality seeks \u201cto withdraw a previously granted tax exemption, the municipality bears the burden of proving that the real property is subject to taxation\u201d <em>(Matter of New York Botanical Garden v Assessors of Town of Washington, </em>55 NY2d 328, 334 [1982]). The Lackawanna tax assessor has satisfied his burden.</p>\n<p id=\"b673-5\">We first pause to note what we are not deciding today. This case does not present for our consideration, under either the Not-For-Profit Corporation Law or the Real Property Tax Law, whether the 100 Ridge Road property was exempt from taxation prior to LCDC\u2019s leasing it to an entity that carries out for-profit manufacturing activities on the property. For present purposes, therefore, we assume without deciding that prior to it being leased, the 100 Ridge Road property held by LCDC was exempt from taxation.</p>\n<p id=\"b673-6\">It is the actual or physical use of the property that the Real Property Tax Law is concerned with when it exempts from taxation property <em>\u201cused </em>exclusively for carrying out <em>thereupon </em>one or more\u201d exempt purposes (RPTL 420-a [1] [a] [emphasis added]; <em>see Matter of Adult Home at Erie Sta., Inc. v Assessor &amp; Bd. of Assessment Review of City of Middletown, </em>10 NY3d 205, 216 [2008] [the \u201cissue is . . . whether the property is \u2018used exclusively\u2019 \u201d for an exempt purpose, and property used to provide housing for the indigent and property used to provide housing for people \u201cwhile they participate in social work programs\u201d is \u201cused\u201d within the meaning of the statute]).<footnotemark>*</footnotemark></p>\n<p id=\"b674-4\"><page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"582\">*582</page-number>We find no support in the Real Property Tax Law or the Not-For-Profit Corporation Law for LCDC\u2019s argument that the 100 Ridge Road property is \u201cused\u201d by LCDC because LCDC is leasing it in furtherance of LCDC\u2019s purpose of spurring economic development. There is no question that local development corporations formed under the Not-For-Profit Corporation Law for the \u201ccharitable or public purposes of relieving and reducing unemployment . . . bettering and maintaining job opportunities, instructing or training individuals to improve or develop their capabilities for such jobs,\u201d and \u201cencouraging the development of, or retention of, an industry in the community or area,\u201d among other purposes (N-PCL 1411 [a]), are pursuing laudable goals that better the State\u2019s communities, and LCDC is no exception. Not all laudable activities, however, entitle the actor to a property tax exemption, and we decline LCDC\u2019s invitation to read the Real Property Tax Law together with the Not-For-Profit Corporation Law in such a manner as to establish a \u201ctax loophole\u201d where one would not otherwise exist <em>(see Sisters of St. Joseph v City of New York, </em>49 NY2d 429, 441 [1980]).</p>\n<p id=\"b674-5\">Moreover, if the Legislature had intended to provide a blanket real property tax exemption for local development corporations, it would have done so expressly, as it has in other contexts <em>(compare </em>N-PCL 1411 [f] [providing that the \u201cincome and operations\u201d of local development corporations formed under the statute are exempt from taxation], <em>with </em>General Municipal Law \u00a7 874 [1] [providing that an industrial development agency \u201cshall be required to pay no taxes or assessments upon any of the property acquired by it or under its jurisdiction or control or supervision or upon its activities\u201d]).</p>\n<p id=\"b674-6\">Accordingly, the order of the Appellate Division should be affirmed, with costs.</p>\n<p id=\"b674-7\">Judges Ciparick, Graffeo, Read, Smith, Pigott and Jones concur.</p>\n<p id=\"b674-8\">Order affirmed, with costs.</p>\n<footnote label=\"*\">\n<p id=\"b673-7\"> In <em>Matter of Adult Home </em>the use of the property at issue was said to be reasonably incident to an exempt purpose (10 NY3d at 216), and it has long been clear that the statute\u2019s \u201cused exclusively\u201d language should be understood to mean \u201cused principally\u201d <em>(see Matter of Symphony Space v Tishelman, </em>60 NY2d 33, 38 [1983]). Whether the use of real property to carry out an exempt <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"582\">*582</page-number>purpose is characterized, as here, as the sole use of the property or, as in <em>Matter of Adult Home, </em>as a use reasonably incident to an exempt purpose, it is the actual or physical use of the real property that is determinative under section 420-a (1) (a).</p>\n</footnote>\n</opinion>\n</casebody>\n",
