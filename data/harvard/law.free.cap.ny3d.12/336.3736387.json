The presumption against suicide applies to the medical examiner under the common law, the Constitution and the case law of the State of New York. <em>(Washington v Glucksberg, </em>521 US 702; <em>Matter of Von Holden v Chapman, </em>87 AD2d 66; <em>Matter of Senior v Boyle, </em>221 NY 414; <em>Matter of Leib v Paparo, </em>84 AD2d 538, 55 NY2d 603; <em>Schelberger v Eastern Sav.

Even if the presumption against suicide is held not to apply to the medical examiner in this case, the determination by the Monroe County medical examiner of suicide as the manner of death of Rosemary A. Infante is arbitrary and capricious such that no reasonable person would be expected to make it. <em>(Matter of Mitchell v Helpern, </em>17 AD2d 922, 14 NY2d 817; <em>Green v </em><page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"338\">*338</page-number><em>William, Penn Life Ins.

Infante\u2019s death on April 16, 2006, the Monroe County Office of <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"339\">*339</page-number>the Medical Examiner investigated its cause. In an autopsy report dated August 8, 2006, the medical examiner assigned to the case, an experienced forensic pathologist, concluded that decedent had died of multiple drug intoxication and that the manner of her death was suicide.</p>\n<p id=\"b431-5\">On December 8, 2006, petitioner George Infante, decedent\u2019s father and the administrator of her estate, commenced this CPLR article 78 proceeding, alleging that \u201cth[e] classification of decedent\u2019s death as a suicide [was] not based upon any credible evidence and [was] simply speculation, and as such the finding [was] arbitrary and capricious and/or an abuse of discretion.\u201d He sought a declaration that the manner of decedent\u2019s death was unintentional or undetermined rather than suicide.</p>\n<p id=\"b431-6\">On February 2, 2007, Supreme Court dismissed the petition, adopting the reasoning of the Appellate Division\u2019s decision in <em>Matter of Mitchell v Helpern </em>(17 AD2d 922 [1st Dept 1962], <em>affd without op </em>14 NY2d 817 [1964]), where a petitioner likewise sought to compel a medical examiner to revise a death certificate attributing death to suicide. Quoting <em>Mitchell, </em>the trial judge observed that \u201c[w]hen the medical and other facts could sustain different inferences, \u2018the determinations of the medical examiners must be sustained as far as their entries on the public record are concerned unless the determinations are arbitrary\u2019 and that \u201c \u2018[a] public determination is arbitrary when no reasonable man would be expected to make it.\u2019 \u201d Applying these principles to the facts of the case, Supreme Court acknowledged that \u201c[a]n impartial evaluation of the medical and factual circumstances . . . could result in differing conclusions of the manner of death as an accident or cause unknown or suicide\u201d; however, because \u201c[t]here [was] sufficient information on the record for a reasonable person to make the finding of suicide,\u201d the medical examiner\u2019s \u201cdetermination of the manner of death as suicide . . . [was] not arbitrary.\u201d</p>\n<p id=\"b431-7\">On appeal, the Appellate Division, with two Justices dissenting, reversed on the ground that \u201cthe evidence before [the medical examiner] was insufficient to rebut the presumption against suicide\u201d <em>(Matter of Infante v Dignan, </em>55 AD3d 1258, 1259 [4th Dept 2008]). The majority recognized that the medical examiner\u2019s \u201cdetermination was based upon the autopsy and toxicology report as well as information concerning the scene of the death,\u201d but nonetheless concluded that \u201cthe evidence from which the determination was made failed to rebut the presumption against <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"340\">*340</page-number>suicide, and thus . . . [was] arbitrary and capricious\u201d <em>(id. </em>at 1261).</p>\n<p id=\"b432-4\">The two dissenting Justices would have applied the CPLR article 78 standard of review unencumbered by any common-law presumption. As a result, although there were facts \u201c suggesting] that [the medical examiner\u2019s] determination of suicide may well [have been] mistaken,\u201d his determination was not \u201carbitrary or irrational\u201d in their view <em>(id. </em>at 1263). The dissenting Justices found no authority indicating that the presumption against suicide\u2014an evidentiary rule in litigation involving life insurance claims\u2014was relevant where \u201ca medical examiner . . . discharged] his or her administrative function of determining the means or manner of an unattended death\u201d <em>(id. </em>at 1262, quoting County Law \u00a7 674 [3] [a] [internal quotation marks omitted]). The double dissent on an issue of law brought the case to us <em>(see </em>CPLR 5601 [a]), and we now reverse.</p>\n<p id=\"b432-5\">New York\u2019s common-law presumption against suicide has no role to play in a medical examiner\u2019s determination of the cause or manner of a decedent\u2019s death, or the judicial review of such a determination <em>(see e.g. </em>Public Health Law \u00a7 4143 [3] [directing medical examiner to certify whether a death from external causes was <em>\u201cprobably </em>accidental, suicidal or homicidal\u201d (emphasis added)]). The presumption is an evidentiary rule relevant to resolving disputes over life insurance proceeds <em>(see Green v William Penn Life Ins. Co. of N.Y., </em>12 NY3d 342 [2009] [decided today]). We have never considered the presumption in any other context.</p>\n<p id=\"b432-6\">As a statutory matter, the County Law requires a medical examiner to \u201cdetermine the means or manner of death\u201d (County Law \u00a7 674 [3] [a]; \u00a7 671) for the benefit of the public at large rather than for the benefit of individuals, including a decedent\u2019s family members <em>(see e.g. Lauer v City of New York, </em>95 NY2d 95 [2000] [New York City medical examiner did not owe duty of care to father of child whose death was wrongly attributed to homicide]). If medical examiners were forced to leaven their decision-making with a common-law evidentiary presumption, the medical and scientific quality of their work would be seriously compromised to the detriment of the citizenry.</p>\n<p id=\"b432-7\">In this case, there is evidentiary support for the medical examiner\u2019s determination of suicide, although\u2014as every judge who has reviewed the record has observed\u2014there is also reason to believe that decedent may have accidentally overdosed on <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"341\">*341</page-number>prescription medication. As was pointed out 47 years ago in <em>Mitchell, </em>\u201c[i]n ... an arguable situation capable of sustaining different inferences, the determinations of the Medical Examiners must be sustained . . . unless [they] are arbitrary\u201d (17 AD2d at 922).</p>\n<p id=\"b433-5\">Here, the medical examiner\u2019s determination was not arbitrary. He performed an autopsy, during which he removed samples of decedent\u2019s heart blood, urine, liver, brain, and gastric contents for comprehensive drug screen analysis. The results of this analysis, which were reported by an experienced forensic toxicologist, disclosed an extremely high heart blood concentration of the drug fluoxetine (commercially known as Prozac)\u2014a level 18 to 20 times higher than would be expected with normal therapeutic usage. In addition, the level of a fluoxetine metabolite in decedent\u2019s liver was comparatively high in relation to the parent drug\u2019s level in her heart blood. The medical examiner characterized these autopsy and toxicological findings as \u201cmost significant\u201d in leading him to conclude that decedent\u2019s manner of death was suicide. In his opinion, these levels and their ratio were consistent with intentional excessive consumption, but not chronic overusage or accidental overdose. In short, the medical examiner set forth a reasonable basis for his determination in an area where administrative judgment involves specialized medical and scientific expertise (see <em>generally Flacke v Onondaga Landfill Sys., </em>69 NY2d 355, 363 [1987] [\u201cwhere . . . the judgment of the agency involves factual evaluations in the area of the agency\u2019s expertise and is supported by the record, such judgment must be accorded great weight and judicial deference\u201d]).</p>\n<p id=\"b433-6\">Accordingly, the order of the Appellate Division should be reversed, with costs, and Supreme Court\u2019s judgment reinstated.</p>\n<p id=\"b433-7\">Chief Judge Lippman and Judges Ciparick, Smith, Pigott and Jones concur; Judge Graffeo taking no part.</p>\n<p id=\"b433-8\">Order reversed, etc.</p>\n</opinion>\n</casebody>\n",
