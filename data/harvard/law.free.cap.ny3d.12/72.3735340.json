The standard of review of a Public Employment Relations Board (PERB) decision is very limited; PERB\u2019s construction of the Taylor Law must be confirmed unless irrational. <em>(Matter of Board of Educ. of City School Dist. of City of N.Y. v New York State Pub.

The Public Employment Relations Board\u2019s order imposes no duty other than the statutory duty to bargain a decision to subcontract exclusive bargaining unit work. <em>(Matter of Hearst Corp. v Clyne, 50 </em>NY2d 707.) IV. The Correction Law does not preempt negotiations regarding the transfer of exclusive bargaining unit work. <em>(Matter of Newark Val. Cent. School Dist. v Public Empl.

Public policy underlying the Correction Law does not preclude negotiations regarding the transfer of exclusive bargaining unit work. <em>(Matter of Patrolmen\u2019s Benevolent Assn. of City of N.Y., Inc. v New York State Pub.

Whether the classification and assignment of inmates is a mandatory subject of negotiations is immaterial to the Public Employment Relations Board\u2019s decision and order. VII. The decision to transfer guarding responsibilities does not constitute a fundamental policy decision implementing the Erie County Sheriffs mission to classify and house inmates. <em>(Matter of West Irondequoit Teachers Assn. v Helsby, </em>35 NY2d 46; <em>Matter of Civil Serv.

We agree.</p>\n<p id=\"b168-9\">I.</p>\n<p id=\"b168-10\">CSEA is the authorized collective bargaining representative for correction officers exclusively charged with guarding sentenced inmates incarcerated at the Erie County Correctional Facility. Teamsters is the authorized collective bargaining representative of deputy sheriffs who are exclusively charged with guarding presentenced and pretrial detainees (collectively referred to as unsentenced inmates) housed at the Erie County Holding Center and the \u201cAnnex,\u201d a space adjoining the Correctional Facility which holds the overflow of inmates from the Holding Center. Petitioners do not dispute that correction offi<page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"77\">*77</page-number>cers and deputy sheriffs have exclusively guarded sentenced and unsentenced inmates, respectively, since 1995.</p>\n<p id=\"b169-5\">In August 2000, the Erie County Legislature voted to transfer control of the Correctional Facility from the Erie County Executive to the Erie County Sheriff, a measure county residents approved in a referendum, leaving the Sheriff in control of both detention facilities. The guarding duties of correction officers and deputy sheriffs remained unchanged.</p>\n<p id=\"b169-6\">In early 2002, the Sheriff notified the unions that, due to this change in mission, it was necessary to implement a new classification system for the housing of inmates. The Sheriff initially prepared a unified classification plan that assigned housing based on risk without consideration of adjudication status, resulting in the commingling of sentenced and unsentenced inmates, but later withdrew that plan after resistance from the unions. In its place, the Sheriff implemented separate classification systems for the Correctional Facility and the Holding Center in order to maintain the separation of sentenced and unsentenced inmates.</p>\n<p id=\"b169-7\">Subsequently, the State Commission of Correction conducted an evaluation of the Holding Center and cited the Sheriff for overcrowding at that facility while the Correctional Facility had vacancies. The Commission found that the cause of the overcrowding was the Sheriffs failure to use a unified classification system for both facilities. In order to alleviate the overcrowding, the Commission directed the Sheriff to utilize the criteria set forth in Correction Law \u00a7 500-b (7) (a) and (b) and 9 NYCRR part 7013. In response, the Sheriff promulgated a single classification instrument that resulted in the commingling of sentenced with unsentenced inmates at both facilities, and correction officers and deputy sheriffs being assigned to guard both.</p>\n<p id=\"b169-8\">The unions thereafter filed improper practice charges alleging that petitioners violated Civil Service Law \u00a7 209-a (1) (d) by unilaterally transferring exclusive bargaining unit work to non-unit employees. The charges were consolidated and, after a hearing, an Administrative Law Judge ruled in favor of the unions and ordered that petitioners cease and desist in the assignment of sentenced inmates to the deputy sheriffs and the assignment of unsentenced inmates to correction officers. After the ALJ\u2019s decision was affirmed by PERB, petitioners commenced this CPLR article 78 proceeding, challenging as <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"78\">*78</page-number>arbitrary and capricious PERB\u2019s determination that their change in mission defense was inapplicable.</p>\n<p id=\"b170-5\">Supreme Court transferred the matter to the Appellate Division which confirmed PERB\u2019s determination, dismissed the petition and granted the unions\u2019 counterclaims seeking enforcement of the decision (43 AD3d 1311 [2007], <em>lv granted </em>10 NY3d 708 [2008]). We now reverse and grant the petition.</p>\n<p id=\"b170-6\">II.</p>\n<p id=\"b170-7\">A public employer\u2019s decisions are not bargainable as terms and conditions of employment where \u201cthey are inherently and fundamentally policy decisions relating to the primary mission of the . . . employer\u201d <em>(Matter of Board of Educ. of City School Dist. of City of N.Y. v New York State Pub. Empl. Relations Bd., </em>75 NY2d 660, 669 [1990], citing <em>Matter of West Irondequoit Teachers Assn. v Helsby, 35 </em>NY2d 46 [1974]). Although such policy decisions are exempt from bargaining, the <em>impact </em>of those decisions is not <em>(see West Irondequoit Teachers Assn., 35 </em>NY2d at 51; <em>see also Matter of Levitt v Board of Collective Bargaining of City of </em>N.Y., <em>Off. of Collective Bargaining, </em>79 NY2d 120, 127 [1992]).</p>\n<p id=\"b170-8\">In <em>West Irondequoit Teachers Assn. </em>(35 NY2d 46 [1974]), this court upheld a PERB determination that found the fixing of class size not to be a term or condition of employment (and therefore not negotiable), but rather a matter of educational policy. That fact alone, however, did not preclude the teachers\u2019 association from bargaining over the impact of the policy on the teachers\u2019 working conditions <em>(id. </em>at 49-50). Although we concluded in that case that PERB \u201carticulated a rational basis for its determination in the [school board\u2019s] favor\u201d <em>(id. </em>at 52), the same cannot be said, in this instance, about PERB\u2019s determination that the Sheriff was required to first negotiate with the unions before implementing a classification policy satisfactory to the Commission.</p>\n<p id=\"b170-9\">Correction Law \u00a7 500-b directs that the Sheriff \u201cshall exercise good judgment and discretion\u201d and \u201ctake all reasonable steps to ensure that the assignment of persons\u201d to housing units \u201cfosters the safety, security and good order of the jail\u201d while concomitantly ensuring that necessary precautions are made for the safety and welfare of those in custody (Correction Law \u00a7 500-b [7] [a] [l]-[2]; <em>see </em>9 NYCRR 7013.1, 7013.2). As part of those responsibilities, the Sheriff is charged with \u201cimplementing] and maintaining] a formal and objective system for the <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"79\">*79</page-number>consistent classification of all inmates\u201d (9 NYCRR 7013.1), requiring \u201ca procedure for determining an inmate\u2019s appropriate housing assignment which utilizes a point scale, decision tree or other method capable of quantifiable analysis or computation\u201d (9 NYCRR 7013.2 [b]). Factors that the Sheriff must consider include, among other things, criminal history, prior escapes, mental/medical illness, history of hostile relationships with other inmates, and any other information the Sheriff deems necessary to ensure inmate safety <em>(see </em>Correction Law \u00a7 500-b [7] [b]; 9 NYCRR 7013.8 [c]). Significantly, none of those factors takes into account the adjudication status of the inmate or the allocation of work among collective bargaining units.</p>\n<p id=\"b171-5\">Given the statutory requirement that the Sheriff implement and maintain a formal and objective classification system, we conclude that PERB\u2019s determination that petitioners committed an improper practice by unilaterally transferring unit work to nonunit employees is not entitled to deference <em>(see Matter of Newark Val. Cent. School Dist. v Public Empl. Relations Bd., </em>83 NY2d 315, 320 [1994], citing <em>Matter of Rosen v Public Empl. Relations Bd., </em>72 NY2d 42, 47-48 [1988]). Once having implemented such a system, the impact of that decision, if any, upon the contracts between the parties is subject to bargaining <em>(see Matter of City School Dist. of City of New Rochelle [New Rochelle Fedn. of Teachers, Local #280, AFT, AFL-CIO], </em>4 PERB \u00b6 3060 [1971]; <em>see also West Irondequoit Teachers Assn., </em>35 NY2d at 49-50; <em>Matter of Amalgamated Tr. Union, Local 1342 [Niagara Frontier Tr. Metro Sys., Inc.], </em>36 PERB \u00b6 3036 [2003]).</p>\n<p id=\"b171-6\">Accordingly, the judgment of the Appellate Division should be reversed, with costs, the petition granted, the August 9, 2006 determination of PERB annulled and the counterclaims for enforcement of PERB\u2019s determination dismissed.</p>\n<p id=\"b171-7\">Judges Ciparick, Graffeo, Read, Smith and Jones concur; Chief Judge Lippman taking no part.</p>\n<p id=\"b171-8\">Judgment reversed, etc.</p>\n</opinion>\n</casebody>\n",
