The majority\u2019s reasoning is faulty because it overlooks General Obligations Law \u00a7 5-321.</p>\n<opinion data-order=\"11\" data-type=\"opinion\" id=\"x999-1\" type=\"majority\">\n<p id=\"b690-6\">OPINION OF THE COURT</p>\n<author id=\"b690-7\">Chief Judge Lippman.</author>\n<p id=\"b690-8\">We are asked to determine whether a landlord is an additional insured under an insurance policy obtained by his tenant such that the insurer is obligated to defend and indemnify the landlord in an underlying personal injury lawsuit. Joseph Kassis (Kassis) leased property in Syracuse, New York to Kassis Superior Sign Co., Inc. (Superior Sign), and Superior Sign obtained a commercial general liability insurance policy on the property from The Ohio Casualty Insurance Company (Ohio Casualty). On February 25, 2004, Andrew Holden, a Superior Sign employee, slipped on an accumulation of snow and/or ice on the leased property and thereafter commenced the underlying action against Kassis. Ohio Casualty disclaimed on the ground that the policy, which names only Superior Sign, did not afford Kassis coverage. Kassis and Superior Sign commenced this action seeking a declaration that Ohio Casualty is obligated to defend and indemnify Kassis in the <em>Holden </em>action.<footnotemark>1</footnotemark> Supreme <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"599\">*599</page-number>Court granted plaintiffs\u2019 motion for summary judgment in part and declared that Ohio Casualty is obligated to provide a defense in the <em>Holden </em>action (2007 NY Slip Op 34414[U]). The Appellate Division reversed and found no obligation to defend or indemnify (51 AD3d 1366 [4th Dept 2008]). Plaintiffs have appealed as of right, pursuant to CPLR 5601 (a), and we now reverse.</p>\n<p id=\"b691-5\">Under the lease, Superior Sign is obligated to pay for snow removal services and to</p>\n<blockquote id=\"b691-6\">\u201cindemnify, defend, and hold harmless Landlord from any and all damages, costs, expenses, and liabilities for anything arising out of the occupancy of the Premises caused by Tenant or its agents and from any loss or damage arising out of the acts of Tenant or its agents or the failure of Tenant to comply with the terms and conditions\u201d of the lease.</blockquote>\n<p id=\"b691-7\">The lease further provides that Superior Sign, \u201cat its sole cost and expense and for the mutual benefit of Landlord and Tenant, shall maintain a general liability policy . . . providing coverage against claims for bodily injury, personal injury and property damage\u201d with specified aggregate and per occurrence coverage amounts.</p>\n<p id=\"b691-8\">Superior Sign obtained a commercial general liability insurance policy from Ohio Casualty. The policy provides bodily injury coverage where \u201cthe insured is obligated to pay damages by reason of the assumption of liability in a contract or agreement\u201d and that contract or agreement falls within the definition of an \u201cinsured contract.\u201d The parties do not dispute that Superior Sign\u2019s lease is an \u201cinsured contract\u201d as that term is defined in the insurance policy.<footnotemark>2</footnotemark> Moreover, the policy\u2019s blanket additional insured provision extends coverage not simply to the named insured, i.e., Superior Sign, but also to \u201cany person or organization whom [the named insured is] required to name as an additional insured on this policy under a written contract or agreement.\u201d \u201c \u2018Additional insured\u2019 is a recognized term in insurance <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"600\">*600</page-number>contracts,\u201d and \u201cthe well-understood meaning of the term is an entity enjoying the <em>same </em>protection as the named insured\u201d <em>(Pecker Iron Works of N.Y. v Traveler\u2019s Ins. Co., </em>99 NY2d 391, 393 [2003] [some internal quotation marks and citations omitted; emphasis added]). Notably, the insurance policy does not require Superior Sign to provide Ohio Casualty with notice of those persons or organizations Superior Sign is contractually required to name as an additional insured on the policy. Superior Sign is not required to complete and return to Ohio Casualty any notification forms listing those persons or organizations that it intended to name as additional insureds under the policy, nor does the policy require the submission of any additional insured certificates or the like.</p>\n<p id=\"b692-5\">Thus, in deciding the ultimate question\u2014i.e., whether Kassis is an additional insured under the subject policy obligating Ohio Casualty to defend and indemnify him in connection with the underlying personal injury action\u2014we need only determine whether, under the lease, Superior Sign was required to ensure that Kassis received general liability insurance coverage equivalent to the coverage Superior Sign enjoyed.</p>\n<p id=\"b692-6\">Pursuant to the general liability insurance provision of the lease in question, Superior Sign was obligated to obtain coverage at specified monetary levels in the aggregate and per occurrence against \u201cclaims for bodily injury, personal injury and property damage\u201d \u201cat its sole cost and expense and for the mutual benefit of [Kassis] and [Superior Sign].\u201d The natural and intended meaning of the term \u201cmutual benefit\u201d as used in this provision is that Kassis and Superior Sign are intended to enjoy the same level of coverage.</p>\n<p id=\"b692-7\">The intent and meaning of the term \u201cmutual benefit\u201d in the provision becomes clear when juxtaposed with the language of the other insurance provisions of the lease. The lease expressly contemplates that both Kassis and Superior Sign will enjoy fire insurance, and the lease further provides in an \u201cAdditional Insurance\u201d provision that Superior Sign may obtain certain types of insurance coverage just for itself. With respect to fire insurance, Kassis, \u201cat Tenant\u2019s sole cost and expense,\u201d is to \u201ckeep the Premises insured for the benefit of the parties against loss or damage by fire,\u201d and fire insurance \u201cmay be written either under separate policies in Landlord\u2019s name or combined with other coverages acquired by Tenant.\u201d As for the additional insurance provision, it specifies that Superior Sign, \u201cat its sole cost and expense, may maintain insurance coverage for its <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"601\">*601</page-number>benefit on Tenant\u2019s leasehold improvements and Tenant\u2019s personal property in such amounts as Tenant deems appropriate with Tenant assuming the risk of any co-insurance.\u201d The additional insurance provision also expressly permits Superior Sign to \u201ceffect for its own account any insurance not required by the provisions of this Lease, including business interruption insurance or insurance covering Tenant\u2019s equipment and personal property.\u201d Plainly, where a disparity in coverage as between insureds was contemplated\u2014i.e., where the insurance to be procured was not for the insureds\u2019 \u201cmutual benefit\u201d\u2014it was expressly noted.</p>\n<p id=\"b693-5\">It is therefore clear that Superior Sign was obligated under the lease to procure the same level of general liability insurance coverage for Kassis as it obtained for itself, and because of that, Kassis falls within the policy\u2019s additional insured provision. Because Kassis is considered an additional insured, Ohio Casualty is obligated to defend him in the underlying personal injury action and, if appropriate, indemnify him as an additional insured in accordance with the policy. The parties\u2019 remaining contentions are without merit.</p>\n<p id=\"b693-6\">Accordingly, the order of the Appellate Division should be reversed, with costs, and the judgment of Supreme Court reinstated.</p>\n<p id=\"b693-7\">Judges Ciparick, Graffeo, Read, Smith, Pigott and Jones concur.</p>\n<p id=\"b693-8\">Order reversed, etc.</p>\n<footnote label=\"1\">\n<p id=\"b690-9\">.  Kassis has standing to bring this action because a person claiming to be an insured under an insurance policy may bring a declaratory judgment <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"599\">*599</page-number>action against an insurer \u201cwhen an actual controversy develops concerning the extent of coverage, the duty to defend, or other issues arising from the insurance contract\u201d <em>(Lang v Hanover Ins. Co., </em>3 NY3d 350, 353 [2004]).</p>\n</footnote>\n<footnote label=\"2\">\n<p id=\"b691-10\">. Under the policy, an \u201cinsured contract\u201d includes a \u201ccontract for a lease of premises\u201d and \u201c[t]hat part of any other contract or agreement pertaining to your business . . . under which you assume the tort liability of another party to pay for \u2018bodily injury\u2019 or \u2018property damage\u2019 to a third person or organization.\u201d \u201c[T]ort liability\u201d is further defined as a \u201cliability that would be imposed by law in the absence of any contract or agreement.\u201d</p>\n</footnote>\n</opinion>\n</casebody>\n",
