At the subsequent sentencing hearing on September 11, 2006, Supreme Court stated that defendant had acknowledged \u201cthat he accepts the plea and the Court certainly intends to go ahead and impose the sentence promised at the time we reached that agreement[;] that is[,] an indeterminate term of imprisonment of 19 years to life.\u201d The judge did not mention that defendant was required to pay a mandatory sur<page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"47\">*47</page-number>charge of $150 and a crime victim assistance fee of $2 as a result of his conviction. These assessments were, however, listed on the \u201cUniform Sentence and Commitment\u201d sheet, which the clerk signed, and the court worksheet, which the judge signed and stamped.</p>\n<p id=\"b139-4\">Defendant appealed, arguing that the mandatory surcharge and crime victim assistance fee should have been pronounced by the judge in open court at sentencing. After the Appellate Division unanimously affirmed his conviction and sentence (45 AD3d 313 [2007]), a Judge of this Court granted defendant leave to appeal (10 NY3d 863 [2008]) so that we might review his claim in light of our recent decision in <em>People v Sparber </em>(10 NY3d 457 [2008]). We now hold that the mandatory surcharge and crime victim assistance fee mandated by Penal Law \u00a7 60.35 (1) are not a part of a sentence within the meaning of sections 380.20 and 380.40 of the CPL; therefore, a judge need not pronounce them in a defendant\u2019s presence during sentencing.</p>\n<p id=\"b139-5\">CPL 380.20 calls upon courts to \u201cpronounce sentence in every case where a conviction is entered\u201d; CPL 380.40 (1) directs that \u201c[t]he defendant must be personally present at the time sentence is pronounced.\u201d CPL 1.20 (13), in turn, defines \u201cconviction\u201d as a plea or verdict of guilty, while CPL 1.20 (14) defines \u201csentence\u201d as \u201cthe imposition and entry of sentence upon a conviction.\u201d Thus, although the CPL commands that a defendant\u2019s \u201csentence\u201d must be \u201cpronounced\u201d by the court in the defendant\u2019s presence, it gives no guidance as to which consequences of a conviction are covered by this requirement. This is where our decisions in <em>Sparber </em>and <em>People v Nieves </em>(2 NY3d 310 [2004]) come into play.</p>\n<p id=\"b139-6\">In <em>Sparber, </em>we concluded that because postrelease supervision (PRS) is a component element of a sentence, CPL 380.20 and 380.40 require a judge to pronounce the terms of PRS at sentencing (10 NY3d at 468-469). In <em>Nieves </em>we found a defendant\u2019s unpreserved claim of error to be unreviewable under the exception to the preservation requirement for an illegal sentence. This was so because \u201calthough the orders of protection [in question] were issued at [Nieves\u2019] sentencing proceeding, it [wa]s evident from the statutory scheme that the orders were not a part of defendant\u2019s sentence\u201d (2 NY3d at 316). In both cases, we carefully examined the language of the statute imposing or authorizing the particular consequence of conviction at issue in order to decide whether it inhered in the sentence.</p>\n<p id=\"b140-4\"><page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"48\">*48</page-number>For example, at the time of our decision in <em>Sparber, </em>Penal Law \u00a7 70.45, entitled \u201cDeterminate sentence; post-release supervision,\u201d deemed PRS to be \u201ca part\u201d of a determinate sentence <em>(see </em>10 NY3d at 468-469); the provision began as follows: \u201c1. In general. Each determinate sentence also includes, <em>as a part thereof, </em>an additional period of post-release supervision\u201d (emphasis added). Concomitantly, Penal Law \u00a7 70.00 (6) specifies that the determinate sentences for which it provides \u201cshall include, <em>as a part thereof, </em>a period of post-release supervision in accordance with section 70.45\u201d (emphasis added). By contrast, the statute construed in Nieves\u2014CPL 530.13 (4)\u2014 \u201c[did] not characterize permanent orders of protection as a component of sentencing,\u201d and \u201c[n]o reference [was] made in any . . . provisions [governing sentences for criminal offenses] to an order of protection as a permissible sentence\u201d <em>(Nieves, </em>2 NY3d at 316).</p>\n<p id=\"b140-5\">The statute imposing the mandatory surcharge and crime victim assistance fee, while noting that these assessments are to be \u201clevied at sentencing,\u201d describes them as distinct from \u201cany sentence required or permitted by law\u201d (Penal\" Law \u00a7 60.35 [1] [a]). Specifically, Penal Law \u00a7 60.35 (1) (a) states that \u201cthere shall be levied at sentencing a mandatory surcharge, sex offender registration fee, DNA databank fee and a crime victim assistance fee <em>in addition to any sentence required or permitted by </em>law\u201d (emphasis added), rather than as \u201ca part\u201d of the sentence itself, as was the case with the statute we interpreted in <em>Sparber. </em>Unlike the statute we considered in <em>Nieves, </em>section 60.35 (l)\u2019s text clearly indicates that the surcharge and fee are <em>not </em>incorporated into the sentence; it is not merely silent as to this issue. As a result, the fact that this provision is within the Penal Law\u2019s sentencing scheme does not lead to the conclusion that these assessments are component elements of the sentence.</p>\n<p id=\"b140-6\">Defendant argues, however, that the language of section 60.35 (1) does not mandate the outcome in this case because Penal Law \u00a7 60.35 (2) refers to a <em>\u201csentence to pay </em>a mandatory surcharge, crime victim assistance fee or supplemental sex offender victim fee\u201d (emphasis added). But it is subdivision (1) of section 60.35\u2014not subdivision (2)\u2014which actually creates the obligation to pay the mandatory surcharge and crime victim assistance fee; subdivision (2) merely tells the court how to calculate the surcharge and the various fees in cases where a person has been convicted of two or more crimes or violations or offenses. Further, section 60.35 (l)\u2019s legislative history strongly supports <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"49\">*49</page-number>the proposition that the Legislature did not intend the surcharge or fee to be \u201can additional punishment component\u201d of a sentence <em>(see Sparber, </em>10 NY3d at 469).</p>\n<p id=\"b141-4\">Section 60.35 was originally enacted as part of a massive revenue-raising bill meant to \u201cavert the loss of an estimated $100 million in State tax revenues\u201d (Legislative Mem in Support, Bill Jacket, L 1982, ch 55, at 6; <em>see also People v Quinones, </em>95 NY2d 349, 352 [2000] [\u201cThe mandatory surcharge/crime victim assistance fee is paid to the State to shift costs of providing services to victims of crime from law abiding taxpayers and toward those who commit crimes\u201d (internal quotations marks omitted)]; <em>People v Barnes, </em>62 NY2d 702, 703 [1984] [mandatory surcharge levied and collected following every criminal conviction \u201cappear(s) to be related ... to the State\u2019s legitimate interest in raising revenues\u201d]).</p>\n<p id=\"b141-5\">Finally, the statute\u2019s nomenclature reinforces its nonpunitive nature: the assessments imposed by section 60.35 (1) are called a \u201csurcharge\u201d or a \u201cfee,\u201d not a \u201cpenalty.\u201d Indeed, when first enacted in 1982, Penal Law \u00a7 60.35 was entitled \u201cMandatory <em>penalty </em>assessment required in certain cases\u201d (emphasis added). The very next year, the Legislature changed every statutory reference to \u201cpenalty assessment\u201d in Penal Law \u00a7 60.35 and CPL 420.35 to \u201cmandatory surcharge\u201d <em>(see </em>L 1983, ch 15, \u00a7\u00a7 2, 3 [emphasis added]). A \u201csurcharge\u201d is generally defined as \u201can additional tax, cost, or impost\u201d <em>(see </em>Merriam-Webster\u2019s Collegiate Dictionary 1185 [10th ed 1996]).</p>\n<p id=\"b141-6\">The Senate-Assembly Memorandum in Support of the 1983 legislation\u2014the \u201csubject and purpose\u201d of which was to \u201cprovide[ ] the revenues necessary to finance the 1983-84 State Budget\u201d <em>(see </em>Bill Jacket, L 1983, ch 15, at 9)\u2014states as follows:</p>\n<blockquote id=\"b141-7\">\u201cSUMMARY OF PROVISIONS . . .</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b141-8\">\u201cSections two and three amend the Penal Law and the Criminal Procedure[ ] Law to make technical changes to collection procedures first enacted in 1982-83. These technical changes correct the problems that were raised by attorneys and judges alike, and will allow the surcharge program to be implemented with a minimum of confusion\u201d <em>(id.).</em></blockquote>\n<p id=\"b141-9\">Most of the technical changes made by sections 2 and 3 consisted of substituting \u201cmandatory surcharge\u201d for \u201cpenalty assessment\u201d (specifically, 13 separate substitutions in Penal Law \u00a7 60.35 and two separate substitutions in CPL 420.35, <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"50\">*50</page-number>including in the title of both provisions). While there is no discussion or explanation in the legislative history of the legal \u201cproblems\u201d or \u201cconfusion\u201d the Legislature meant to dispel by making these linguistic changes, the revised nomenclature eliminated the implication connoted by use of the word \u201cpenalty\u201d that this assessment was meant to be punitive as well as to raise revenue.</p>\n<p id=\"b142-5\">Accordingly, the order of the Appellate Division should be affirmed.</p>\n<p id=\"b142-6\">Judges Ciparick, Graffeo, Smith, Pigott and Jones concur; Chief Judge Lippman taking no part.</p>\n<p id=\"b142-7\">Order affirmed.</p>\n</opinion>\n</casebody>\n",
