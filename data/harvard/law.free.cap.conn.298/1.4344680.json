Accordingly, the state argues that the defendant was not deprived of his constitutional rights. We affirm the judgments of the trial court.</p>\n<p id=\"b25-6\">The jury reasonably could have found the following facts. On May 30, 2005, at approximately 12 p.m., the victim and his friend, Patrick Priest, witnessed a fight between two men, Carlos and Marley,<footnotemark>7</footnotemark> at Neon Park in the city of Norwalk. During the fight, Carlos ended up on the ground bleeding. The victim attempted to break up the fight, at which time the defendant arrived with Franklin. The defendant and Franklin argued with the victim over what they perceived as the victim\u2019s participation in the beating of Carlos. Even though the victim attempted to explain that he was trying to stop the <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"6\">*6</page-number>fight, the defendant and Franklin angrily left the park with Carlos. The victim remained at the park with Priest.</p>\n<p id=\"b26-6\">Within ten to fifteen minutes, the defendant and Franklin returned to the park driving a black Acura. The defendant got out of the driver\u2019s side of the vehicle and approached the victim, accusing him of having \u201ca problem\u201d with his friend, Carlos. The victim attempted to explain that he did not have a problem with Carlos, when Franklin exited from the passenger side of the vehicle with a bandana covering his face and a gun in his hand. Franklin chased the victim through the park and fired four to five gunshots at him. One of the bullets pierced the victim\u2019s right buttock. After shooting the victim, Franklin got back into the Acura and drove away with the defendant.</p>\n<p id=\"b26-7\">The victim made his way to a halfway house, where he asked someone to call an ambulance. He was \u201cfrustrated,\u201d \u201caggravated,\u201d and \u201cpanick[ed]\u201d because this was his first gunshot wound, and he \u201cdidn\u2019t know how to react.\u201d The police arrived soon afterward and asked the victim if he knew who had shot him. Although he knew his assailants, the victim replied \u201c[n]o\u201d because, among other things, he \u201cfear[ed] for [his] life at that time.\u201d Shortly thereafter, the victim was transported by ambulance to a hospital where he remained for two days.</p>\n<p id=\"b26-8\">Approximately one month later, on July 3, 2005, the victim and several friends attended a fireworks event at Veteran\u2019s Memorial Park in Norwalk. At around 9 p.m., while the group was walking across a bridge, the victim spotted Franklin driving up in a blue Dodge Neon. Franklin parked the car in the middle of the street, and the victim yelled to him to get out of the car and \u201cfight a fair one . . . .\u201d While the victim was yelling at Franklin, the defendant approached the victim from behind and said, \u201cI\u2019m out [of] the car . ...\u201d As <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"7\">*7</page-number>soon as the victim turned around and saw the defendant, the defendant fired a gunshot into the victim\u2019s left arm. The defendant then fired a second shot into the victim\u2019s back and a third shot into one of the victim\u2019s legs. Thereafter, the defendant fled on foot and Franklin drove off in the car.</p>\n<p id=\"b27-6\">When the police arrived, the victim told them that the defendant had shot him. The victim also told the police that Franklin had shot him on May 30, 2005. The victim then was transported to the hospital by ambulance, where he underwent surgery for his injuries. As a result of the shooting, the victim sustained several permanent injuries, including paralysis in one of his legs from the knee down.</p>\n<p id=\"b27-7\">The Norwalk police later located the black Acura used in the May 30,2005 shooting outside of a residence in Bridgeport where they found and arrested the defendant and Franklin. The defendant\u2019s mother owned the Acura. The defendant subsequently was charged with two counts of assault in the first degree as a principal or accessory in violation of \u00a7\u00a7 53a-59 (a) (5) and 53a-8 (a), and two counts of commission of a class A, B or C felony with a firearm in violation of \u00a7 53-202k. The jury found the defendant guilty, and the trial court sentenced the defendant to a total effective term of twenty years incarceration. This appeal followed. Additional facts and procedural history will be set forth as necessary.</p>\n<p id=\"b27-8\">On appeal, the defendant claims that the trial court improperly excluded certain impeachment evidence and unduly restricted his attorney\u2019s cross-examination of the victim in violation of the laws of evidence and his rights to confrontation, to compulsory process and to present a defense under the sixth and fourteenth amendments to the United States constitution. Specifically, the defendant claims that the trial court improp<page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"8\">*8</page-number>erly (1) precluded his attorney from cross-examining the victim as to the victim\u2019s possible hope for or expectation of favorable treatment from the state with respect to the victim\u2019s pending felony charges in exchange for his testimony in the present case, and excluded from evidence, as inadmissible hearsay, a transcript from a hearing in one of the victim\u2019s pending criminal cases in which the victim\u2019s attorney indicated that she had secured favorable treatment or hoped for a favorable disposition in that case, (2) precluded his attorney from cross-examining the victim about his relationship with Jamie Hunt, who was the victim\u2019s girlfriend at the time of the shootings, after the victim testified that one of the reasons that he did not immediately inform the police of the identities of his assailants in the May 30, 2005 shooting was that Hunt was \u201cclose to their family,\u201d<footnotemark>8</footnotemark> and the victim \u201cdidn\u2019t want to mess that up with her,\u201d (3) precluded his attorney from impeaching the victim with the facts underlying his felony conviction of possession of a weapon in a motor vehicle and with the name of that offense after the victim testified that he did not carry a gun on May 30, 2005, or \u201con other days,\u201d and (4) precluded his attorney from questioning the victim about his abusive and profane conduct before a Superior Court judge in 2004 and about a profane tattoo that the victim allegedly had, which concerned his disdain for the police.</p>\n<p id=\"b28-6\">We begin by setting forth the following legal principles that guide our analysis of the defendant\u2019s claims. \u201cThe sixth amendment to the [United States] constitution guarantees the right of an accused in a criminal prosecution to confront the witnesses against him. . . . The primary interest secured by confrontation is the right to cross-examination . . . and an important function of cross-examination is the exposure of a witness\u2019 <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"9\">*9</page-number>motivation in testifying. . . . Cross-examination to elicit facts tending to show motive, interest, bias and prejudice is a matter of right and may not be unduly restricted. . . \u201e\u25a0</p>\n<p id=\"b29-6\">\u201cImpeachment of a witness for motive, bias and interest may also be accomplished by the introduction of extrinsic evidence. . . . The same rule that applies to the right to cross-examine applies with respect to extrinsic evidence to show motive, bias and interest; proof of the main facts is a matter of right, but the extent of the proof of details lies in the court\u2019s discretion. . . . The right of confrontation is preserved if defense counsel is permitted to expose to the jury the facts from which jurors, as the sole triers of fact and credibility, could appropriately draw inferences relating to the reliability of the witness. . . .</p>\n<p id=\"b29-7\">\u201cAlthough it is within the trial court\u2019s discretion to determine the extent of cross-examination and the admissibility of evidence, the preclusion of sufficient inquiry into a particular matter tending to show motive, bias and interest may result in a violation of the constitutional requirements [of the confrontation clause] of the sixth amendment.\u201d (Citations omitted; internal quotation marks omitted.) <em>State </em>v. Colton, 227 Conn. 231, 248-49, 630 A.2d 577 (1993). \u201cFurther, the exclusion of defense evidence may deprive the defendant of his constitutional right to present a defense.\u201d <em>State </em>v. <em>DeJesus, </em>270 Conn. 826, 835, 856 A.2d 345 (2004).</p>\n<p id=\"b29-8\">\u201c[T]he confrontation clause does not [however] suspend the rules of evidence to give the defendant the right to engage in unrestricted cross-examination.\u201d (Internal quotation marks omitted.) <em>State </em>v. <em>Brown, </em>273 Conn. 330, 338-39, 869 A.2d 1224 (2005). Rather, \u201c[a] defendant is . . . bound by the rules of evidence in presenting a defense. . . . Although exclusionary rules of evidence cannot be applied mechanistically to <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"10\">*10</page-number>deprive a defendant of his rights, the [federal] constitution does not require that a defendant be permitted to present every piece of evidence he wishes.\u201d (Internal quotation marks omitted.) <em>State </em>v. <em>Winot, </em>294 Conn. 753, 775-76, 988 A.2d 188 (2010). To the contrary, \u201c[t]he [c]onfrontation [c]lause guarantees only an opportunity for effective cross-examination, not cross-examination that is effective in whatever way, and to whatever extent, the defense might wish.\u201d (Internal quotation marks omitted.) <em>State </em>v. <em>Brown, </em>supra, 338. Thus, \u201c[i]f the proffered evidence is not relevant [or constitutes inadmissible hearsay], the defendant\u2019s right to confrontation is not affected, and the evidence was properly excluded.\u201d (Internal quotation marks omitted.) <em>State </em>v. <em>Winot, </em>supra, 776; see also <em>State </em>v. <em>Tutson, </em>278 Conn. 715, 746-51, 899 A.2d 598 (2006) (no violation of constitutional right to present defense when trial court properly excluded evidence on hearsay grounds); <em>State </em>v. <em>Colon, </em>272 Conn. 106, 198-99, 864 A.2d 666 (2004) (\u201cour law is clear that a defendant may introduce only relevant evidence, and, if the proffered evidence is not relevant, its exclusion is proper and the defendant\u2019s right is not violated\u201d [internal quotation marks omitted]), cert. denied, 546 U.S. 848, 126 S. Ct. 102, 163 L. Ed. 2d 116 (2005).</p>\n<p id=\"b30-6\">In analyzing the defendant\u2019s claims, we first review the trial court\u2019s evidentiary rulings. Our standard of review for evidentiary claims is well settled. \u201cTo the extent [that] a trial court\u2019s admission of evidence is based on an interpretation of the Code of Evidence, our standard of review is plenary. For example, whether a challenged statement properly may be classified as hearsay and whether a hearsay exception properly is identified are legal questions demanding plenary review.\u201d <em>State </em>v. <em>Saucier, </em>283 Conn. 207, 218, 926 A.2d 633 (2007). \u201cWe review the trial court\u2019s decision to admit [or exclude] evidence, if premised on a correct <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"11\">*11</page-number>view of the law, however, for an abuse of discretion.\u201d Id. The \u201ctrial court has wide discretion to determine the relevancy of evidence and the scope of cross-examination.\u201d (Internal quotation marks omitted.) <em>State </em>v. <em>Brown, </em>supra, 273 Conn. 339. Thus, \u201c[w]e will make every reasonable presumption in favor of upholding the trial court\u2019s ruling[s] [on these bases] . . . .\u201d (Internal quotation marks omitted.) <em>State </em>v. <em>Cecil J., </em>291 Conn. 813, 818, 970 A.2d 710 (2009). \u201cIn determining whether there has been an abuse of discretion, the ultimate issue is whether the court . . . reasonably [could have] conclude[d] as it did.\u201d (Internal quotation marks omitted.) <em>State </em>v. <em>Orr, </em>291 Conn. 642, 667, 969 A.2d 750 (2009). If, after reviewing the trial court\u2019s evidentiary rulings, we conclude that the trial court properly excluded the proffered evidence, then the defendant\u2019s constitutional claims necessarily fail. See, e.g., <em>State </em>v. <em>Winot, </em>supra, 294 Conn. 776. If, however, we conclude that the trial court improperly excluded certain evidence, we will proceed to analyze \u201c[w]hether [the] limitations on impeachment, including cross-examination, [were] so severe as to violate [the defendant\u2019s rights under] the confrontation clause of the sixth amendment . . . .\u201d <em>State </em>v. <em>Abernathy, </em>72 Conn. App. 831, 837, 806 A.2d 1139, cert. denied, 262 Conn. 924, 814 A.2d 379 (2002). This \u201cis a question of law [that is] reviewed de novo.\u201d Id.</p>\n<p id=\"b31-6\">I</p>\n<p id=\"b31-7\">The defendant first claims that the trial court improperly (1) precluded his attorney from cross-examining the victim as to the victim\u2019s possible hope for or expectation of favorable treatment from the state with respect to the victim\u2019s pending criminal cases in exchange for his testimony in the present case, and (2) excluded from evidence, as inadmissible hearsay, a transcript from a hearing in one of the victim\u2019s pending criminal cases in which the victim\u2019s attorney indicated that she <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"12\">*12</page-number>had received favorable treatment or hoped for a favorable disposition in that case. We disagree.</p>\n<p id=\"b32-6\">The following additional facts and procedural history are relevant to the disposition of these claims. Before the start of trial, the senior assistant state\u2019s attorney (state\u2019s attorney) informed the court that the victim had a criminal history including past convictions and pending charges. With respect to the pending charges, the victim had one pending misdemeanor disorderly conduct charge in one case and multiple, pending felony narcotics charges in two other separate cases. The trial court ruled that impeachment regarding the pending misdemeanor disorderly conduct charge was not permissible and limited impeachment to the pending felony narcotics charges. The defendant\u2019s attorney did not object to that limitation.</p>\n<p id=\"b32-7\">Franklin\u2019s attorney<footnotemark>9</footnotemark> then informed the court that \u201c[t]here\u2019s a suggestion in [a] transcript [from one of the victim\u2019s pending felony cases] that [the victim] may receive some consideration pending his testimony [in the present case]\u201d and asked whether he would be permitted to ask the victim whether he was the subject of pending felony charges and whether he \u201chopes that, if he\u2019s good here, he\u2019ll be cut loose in another bond.\u201d The defendant\u2019s attorney joined in the request of Franklin\u2019s attorney and stated that he had a transcript indicating that the state had offered the victim favorable treatment.</p>\n<p id=\"b32-8\">The trial court then asked the defendant\u2019s attorney whether he had information about the alleged specific agreement referred to in the transcript. The defendant\u2019s attorney responded that he had a good faith basis to question the victim about it because, in the transcript, the victim\u2019s attorney \u201cmentioned in open court regard<page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"13\">*13</page-number>ing getting even more favorable treatment.\u201d The state\u2019s attorney then challenged the representation of the defendant\u2019s attorney that he had a good faith basis to believe that an agreement existed between the victim and the state on the ground that the victim\u2019s attorney previously had informed the defendant\u2019s attorney that the victim would not be receiving any favorable treatment, and any statement indicating otherwise was merely her \u201cwishful thinking\u201d and not the result of any agreement with or promise from the state. In addition, the state\u2019s attorney previously had informed the court and the defendant, at a pretrial hearing in the present case, that no promises were made to the victim directly or indirectly through the victim\u2019s attorney.</p>\n<p id=\"b33-6\">Franklin\u2019s attorney then clarified that it did not matter to him \u201cwhether the state ha[d], in fact, made [an] agreement . ...\u201d In his view, the issue was \u201cwhether [the victim] thinks he\u2019s going to get something, based on what comes out [in his testimony in the present case].\u201d The defendant\u2019s attorney agreed with this statement but then continued to assert that the transcript reflected that the victim had an actual agreement with the state. The defendant\u2019s attorney further stated that, when he recently had spoken to the victim\u2019s attorney, she indicated that she did not believe that she had represented to the court that the victim had an agreement with the state and denied the existence of a transcript that reflected otherwise. Rather than attempt to resolve the dispute as to what the victim\u2019s attorney said to the defendant\u2019s attorney, the court concluded that it would permit defense counsel<footnotemark>10</footnotemark> to ask the victim whether anything, in fact, had been promised to him.</p>\n<p id=\"b33-7\">During direct examination, the victim admitted that he had two pending felony cases and testified that no <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"14\">*14</page-number>promises, guarantees or deals had been given to him in exchange for his testimony in the present case. On cross-examination, the victim reiterated this testimony in response to questions posed by the defendant\u2019s attorney. The defendant\u2019s attorney then asked whether one of the victim\u2019s pending cases dated back to November, 2004. The state\u2019s attorney objected to this question. The court then asked the defendant\u2019s attorney to explain the relevance of the inquiry, to which he replied that the victim\u2019s cases have been pending for more than eighteen months, whereas the present case proceeded to trial in less than one year. The court sustained the objection, stating that the inquiry was not relevant inasmuch as the present case proceeded to trial within one year because the defendant had filed a motion for a speedy trial.</p>\n<p id=\"b34-6\">The defendant\u2019s attorney then had three transcripts from the victim\u2019s pending cases marked for identification as exhibits. One of these transcripts was the transcript that the defendant\u2019s attorney previously had referred to in discussing the matter before the start of the trial. That transcript quotes the victim\u2019s attorney as stating the following: \u201cYour Honor, I\u2019m going to ask for a January [2006] court date .... Prior to [the victim\u2019s] stay in the hospital this summer, I have these cases worked out for the possibility of a fine and his\u2014 the people who are related to \u2014 [the victim\u2019s] case is now pending in part A, so I\u2019m waiting to see what\u2019s happening there in an effort to maybe even resolve this case even more favorably, if possible. So, I\u2019m just going to ask for January [6, 2006], so he doesn\u2019t have to unnecessarily come here before I can offer information that would help dispose of these matters.\u201d</p>\n<p id=\"b34-7\">The state\u2019s attorney objected to the admission of the transcript on hearsay grounds. In response, Franklin\u2019s attorney stated that whether the statements in the transcript constitute hearsay \u201call depends [on] whether <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"15\">*15</page-number>they\u2019re offered for the truth of the matter asserted or the impact on the listener.\u201d Franklin\u2019s attorney added that the victim \u201cmay have heard things that communicated to him something that gave him [an] expectation ... in which case that\u2019s not . . . hearsay.\u201d The court then sustained the objection. Thereafter, the defendant\u2019s attorney again sought to have the transcript admitted for the truth of the statements contained therein, that is, to demonstrate that the victim had received or had been offered favorable treatment in his pending cases in exchange for his testimony in the present case. Specifically, the defendant\u2019s attorney stated: \u201cYour Honor, I\u2019d like to be heard on it, because I have an offer there regarding [the victim] <em>being offered something </em>by \u2014 through his public defender, that is\u2014 that we discussed [before the start of trial] is something that we were allowed to ask him, about whether or not this <em>actually occurred. </em>I have a transcript of it, <em>about a favorable disposition </em>regarding possible fines when he has cases that involve five years of incarceration, minimum. That\u2019s important. The jury needs to know about that, why are his cases going on.\u201d (Emphasis added.)</p>\n<p id=\"b35-6\">The court responded that the victim already had been asked whether he had been offered any favorable treatment, and he said \u201cno.\u201d The court then informed the defendant\u2019s attorney that, if he had evidence that promises have been made, he should produce it. The defendant\u2019s attorney replied, \u201cI did,\u201d referring to the transcript as proof that a promise, in fact, had been offered. He further stated that \u201c[i]t\u2019s pertinent to ask [the victim] if any favorable disposition was offered . . . .\u201d The court again stated that \u201che was asked and answered \u2018no.\u2019 \u201d The defendant\u2019s attorney then argued that, according to the transcript, a deal was offered through the victim\u2019s attorney. The court concluded that the statements of the victim\u2019s attorney were mere con<page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"16\">*16</page-number>jecture because the state did not convey any such deal, and the objection again was sustained.</p>\n<p id=\"b36-6\">During closing argument, the defendant\u2019s attorney referred to the fact that the victim had pending felony charges in arguing that the victim was unworthy of belief. Specifically, the defendant\u2019s attorney argued to the jury: \u201cYou know he\u2019s got pending cases. [The victim is] going to do whatever [the victim has to] do to help himself. That means lying, that means sending innocent people to prison. He doesn\u2019t care. He is antisocial.\u201d In addition, the trial court, in its charge to the jury, emphasized that the victim\u2019s pending charges could be used to assess his credibility.</p>\n<p id=\"b36-7\">On appeal, the defendant claims that the trial court improperly precluded his attorney from cross-examining the victim as to the victim\u2019s possible hope for or expectation of favorable treatment from the state in one of the victim\u2019s pending felony cases in exchange for his testimony in the present case. The defendant claims that \u201c[a]ll questions in this area were restricted to whether a \u2018specific agreement\u2019 with the state existed.\u201d In addition, the defendant argues that the trial court improperly excluded from evidence, as inadmissible hearsay, the transcript from a hearing in one of the victim\u2019s pending felony cases. The defendant claims that the trial court\u2019s exclusion of the transcript was improper because the transcript was not offered for the truth of the statements contained therein but, rather, to show their effect on the listener, namely, the victim.</p>\n<p id=\"b36-8\">The state responds that the trial court properly excluded the transcript as inadmissible hearsay because the defendant\u2019s attorney offered it only for the truth of the matter asserted, that is, to demonstrate that the victim had received or had been offered favorable treatment. The state asserts that the defendant\u2019s contention that the transcript was offered to show its effect <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"17\">*17</page-number>on the listener is belied by the facts and is being raised for the first time on appeal.</p>\n<p id=\"b37-6\">First, although the defendant claims that all questions regarding the victim\u2019s hope for or expectation of favorable treatment in his pending cases \u201cwere restricted to whether a \u2018specific agreement\u2019 with the state existed,\u201d a review of the record reveals that the court never restricted the defendant\u2019s attorney\u2019s cross-examination of the victim in this manner. Rather, the only limitation that the court imposed was its exclusion, on hearsay grounds, of the transcript containing the statements made by the victim\u2019s attorney in one of the victim\u2019s pending cases. Thus, the defendant\u2019s attorney was permitted to, and did, cross-examine the victim about his pending felony cases generally, and used this information during closing argument to impugn the victim\u2019s credibility. In addition, the defendant\u2019s attorney was free to cross-examine the victim with respect to whether the victim was motivated by a desire for favorable treatment in his pending cases, <em>separate and apart </em>from the statements of the victim\u2019s attorney that were contained in the excluded transcript. See <em>State </em>v. <em>Cam-erone, </em>8 Conn. App. 317, 323, 513 A.2d 718 (1986) (\u201c[regardless of] whether ... an actual agreement has been worked out, a witness may be cross-examined to show a belief or expectation of favorable treatment by the state\u201d). The defendant\u2019s attorney simply never pursued this line of questioning separately from his quest to introduce the excluded transcript.</p>\n<p id=\"b37-7\">We next review the defendant\u2019s claim that the trial court improperly classified the transcript as hearsay and excluded it from evidence on that basis. We apply plenary review to this issue. See <em>State </em>v. <em>Saucier, </em>supra, 283 Conn. 218.</p>\n<p id=\"b37-8\">\u201c \u2018Hearsay\u2019 means a statement, other than one made by the declarant while testifying at the proceeding, <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"18\">*18</page-number>offered in evidence to establish the truth of the matter asserted.\u201d Corni. Code Evid. \u00a7 8-1 (3). \u201cHearsay is generally inadmissible unless an exception in the Code of Evidence . . . [or] the General Statutes . . . applies. [Id.] \u00a7 8-2.\u201d <em>State </em>v. <em>Foster, </em>293 Conn. 327, 334, 977 A.2d 199 (2009).</p>\n<p id=\"b38-6\">In the present case, the defendant\u2019s attorney repeatedly sought to introduce the excluded transcript as substantive proof that the victim had received or had been offered favorable treatment from the state in exchange for his testimony in the present case. Indeed, the defendant\u2019s attorney consistently argued that the transcript proved that the victim had been \u201coffered something\u201d because the victim\u2019s attorney stated therein that she had one of the victim\u2019s pending felony narcotics cases, in which each of the charges carried a minimum term of five years incarceration, worked out for \u201cpossible fines . . . .\u201d When offered for this purpose, namely, the truth of the matter asserted by the victim\u2019s attorney, the statements in the transcript are unquestionably hearsay. Accordingly, the trial court properly excluded it from evidence on that basis.</p>\n<p id=\"b38-7\">Our conclusion is not altered by the fact that Franklin\u2019s attorney <em>suggested </em>to the trial court that, <em>in theory, </em>the statements in the transcript would not constitute hearsay if they were not offered for their truth but, rather, for their impact on the listener. Although the defendant\u2019s attorney stated that he joined in this theoretical suggestion, he never <em>actually </em>offered the transcript for this purpose.<footnotemark>11</footnotemark> To the contrary, all of the arguments advanced by the defendant\u2019s attorney centered on his contention that the transcript proved that the victim had, in fact, been offered favorable treatment. Moreover, if the defendant\u2019s attorney actually had <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"19\">*19</page-number>attempted to offer the transcript for the purpose of demonstrating its impact on the victim upon hearing his attorney\u2019s statements, that is, as circumstantial evidence that the victim may have believed that he would benefit from favorable treatment in his pending cases in exchange for his testimony in the present case, one would expect that the defendant\u2019s attorney also would have questioned the victim directly regarding such a belief <em>and </em>his motivation to testify in the present case on the basis of that belief. His failure to pursue this line of questioning strengthens our conclusion that the defendant\u2019s attorney sought to admit the transcript only for the truth of the matter asserted therein. Therefore, the trial court properly classified the statements in the transcript as hearsay, and the exclusion of it on that basis did not violate the defendant\u2019s sixth amendment rights to confrontation and to present a defense. See, e.g., <em>State </em>v. <em>Winot, </em>supra, 294 Conn. 775-76 (defendant is bound by rules of evidence in presenting defense); <em>State </em>v. <em>Tutson, </em>supra, 278 Conn. 746-51 (no violation of constitutional right to present defense when trial court properly excluded evidence on hearsay grounds).</p>\n<p id=\"b39-6\">II</p>\n<p id=\"b39-7\">The defendant\u2019s second claim is that the trial court improperly precluded his attorney from cross-examining the victim about his relationship with Hunt, who was the victim\u2019s girlfriend at the time of the shootings, after the victim testified that one of the reasons that he did not immediately inform the police of the identities of his assailants in the May 30, 2005 shooting was that Hunt was \u201cclose to their family\u201d and that the victim \u201cdidn\u2019t want to mess that up with her.\u201d We disagree.</p>\n<p id=\"b39-8\">The following additional facts and procedural history are relevant to this claim. On direct examination, the victim testified that, when the police arrived at the scene of the May 30, 2005 shooting, he refused to tell <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"20\">*20</page-number>them who had shot him because, among other things, he feared for his life at that time. On cross-examination, Franklin\u2019s attorney questioned the victim about his unwillingness to cooperate with the police and asked him whether it was true that he had told the police that he just wanted to go to his girlfriend\u2019s house and that he wanted them to leave him alone. The victim confirmed that this was true. The victim further admitted that he was not truthful with the police on that day when he told them that he did not know who had shot him. Franklin\u2019s attorney then asked the victim why he would leave his assailant at large if he knew that he had shot him. The victim replied that Hunt, the woman he was dating at that time, who also was the mother of his child, was \u201cclose to their family,\u201d and he \u201cdidn\u2019t want to mess that up with her.\u201d Hunt was the victim\u2019s girlfriend at the time of both shootings but not at the time of trial. Franklin\u2019s attorney then asked the victim if Hunt was the woman who was described in various parts of the victim\u2019s hospital records as the victim\u2019s fianc\u00e9e or wife. The victim responded affirmatively but stated that it was Hunt who had made those representations to the hospital.</p>\n<p id=\"b40-6\">In response to further cross-examination by Franklin\u2019s attorney, the victim testified that, after the second shooting, he told the police who had shot him on both May 30 and July 3, 2005. At that point, the victim apparently no longer was worried about spoiling his relationship with Hunt. He also reaffirmed that one of the reasons he did not cooperate with the police on May 30, 2005, was his fear for his life.</p>\n<p id=\"b40-7\">On cross-examination by the defendant\u2019s attorney, the victim again testified that, on May 30, 2005, he did not want to speak to the police because he was \u201cfrustrated\u201d and \u201cagitated,\u201d and just wanted to see Hunt. The defendant\u2019s attorney asked the victim whether his frustration and agitation had anything to do with the <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"21\">*21</page-number>fact that he had fought with Hunt. The victim indicated that it did not, at which point the state\u2019s attorney objected. The court sustained the objection. The defendant\u2019s attorney then asked, \u201cand you\u2019ve been frustrated with . . . Hunt before . . . ?\u201d The state\u2019s attorney again objected on the ground of relevance and claimed that the question probably violated the court\u2019s previous ruling excluding the admission of the victim\u2019s pending misdemeanor disorderly conduct charge, which involved Hunt. The court excused the jury, and the defendant\u2019s attorney attempted to explain the relevance of this line of inquiry.</p>\n<p id=\"b41-6\">The defendant\u2019s attorney argued that the inquiry was relevant because the victim previously had testified that one of the reasons that he did not cooperate with the police on May 30,2005, was that he was in a relationship with Hunt, who was close to one of the assailants\u2019 families, and that he did not want to \u201cmess that up with her.\u201d The defendant\u2019s attorney claimed that this line of inquiry was intended to challenge the victim\u2019s credibility with regard to his motive not to cooperate with the police. Specifically, the defendant\u2019s attorney argued that the victim had misrepresented his relationship with Hunt as being \u201cclose\u201d because he previously had \u201cbeat[en] this person [up] . . . .\u201d The defendant\u2019s attorney claimed, therefore, that the victim was being untruthful when he stated that his relationship with Hunt was one of the reasons why he did not cooperate with the police. The court sustained the objection on the ground that it was \u201cirrelevant to the issue because [the victim] indicated [that] he didn\u2019t tell the police anything about who [had] shot him, which is pertinent.\u201d</p>\n<p id=\"b41-7\">On appeal, the defendant claims that the victim\u2019s refusal or inability to identify his assailants on May 30, 2005, was a relevant area of impeachment and cross-examination, and that the victim \u201c[e]ither . . . had a good reason for not naming them . . . or he . . . just <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"22\">*22</page-number>lied to the police.\u201d (Citation omitted.) The defendant claims that the victim\u2019s relationship with Hunt was \u201cnot a good or viable reason\u201d for delaying his identification of his assailants because his description of that relationship was false. Specifically, the defendant claims that the victim previously had assaulted Hunt, and, therefore, his relationship with her could not have been close. Thus, \u201c[h]is reason for not cooperating [with the police] was \u2018absolutely false.\u2019 \u201d The defendant argues that his attorney should have been permitted to explore the victim\u2019s relationship with Hunt because it was directly relevant to the victim\u2019s testimony about his reasons for lying to the police, showed inconsistencies in his testimony and exposed his tendency to fabricate when it suited his purpose. Accordingly, the defendant claims that the trial court\u2019s determination that this line of questioning was irrelevant and its preclusion of it on that basis were improper.</p>\n<p id=\"b42-6\">The state responds that the trial court properly precluded that line of questioning as irrelevant because the defendant\u2019s attorney\u2019s proffered foundation for the inquiry was based on sheer speculation and failed to establish a viable connection between the victim\u2019s fight with Hunt and the pertinent issues in the case, namely, whether the victim correctly identified the defendant and Franklin as his assailants and whether the victim was truthful when he testified that his relationship with Hunt was one of the reasons why he did not cooperate with the police on May 30,2005. The state further argues that the effort of the defendant\u2019s attorney to cross-examine the victim about his fight with Hunt was merely a veiled attempt to impeach the victim impermissibly with alleged acts of general bad character and to elicit details of a pending disorderly conduct charge that the trial court previously had determined was not a proper ground for impeachment.</p>\n<p id=\"b43-5\"><page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"23\">*23</page-number>We conclude that the trial court did not abuse its discretion in ruling that the defendant\u2019s attorney\u2019s inquiry was irrelevant and precluding it on that basis. \u201cRelevant evidence is evidence that has a logical tendency to aid the trier in the determination of an issue. . . . One fact is relevant to another if in the common course of events the existence of one, alone or with other facts, renders the existence of the other either more certain or more probable. . . . Evidence is irrelevant or too remote if there is such a want of open and visible connection between the evidentiary and principal facts that, all things considered, the former is not worthy or safe to be admitted in the proof of the latter. . . . Evidence is not rendered inadmissible because it is not conclusive. All that is required is that the evidence tend to support a relevant fact even to a slight degree, so long as it is not prejudicial or merely cumulative.\u201d (Internal quotation marks omitted.) <em>State </em>v. <em>Coleman, </em>241 Conn. 784, 788-89, 699 A.2d 91 (1997). \u201cThe trial court has wide discretion to determine the relevancy of evidence\u201d and \u201c[e]very reasonable presumption should be made in favor of the correctness of the court\u2019s ruling in determining whether there has been an abuse of discretion.\u201d (Internal quotation marks omitted.) <em>State </em>v. Sullivan, 244 Conn. 640, 653, 712 A.2d 919 (1998). \u201cThe proffering party bears the burden of establishing the relevance of the offered testimony. Unless such a proper foundation is established, the evidence ... is irrelevant.\u201d (Internal quotation marks omitted.) <em>State </em>v. <em>Pratt, </em>235 Conn. 595, 605, 669 A.2d 562 (1995).</p>\n<p id=\"b43-7\">In the present case, the defendant\u2019s claim lacks a proper foundation and is belied by the evidence. The defendant claims that, because the victim previously had assaulted Hunt, it necessarily follows that his relationship with her could not have been close. On the basis of this assumption, the defendant concludes that the victim\u2019s reason for not cooperating with the police <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"24\">*24</page-number>must have been false. The defendant\u2019s claim suffers from two fatal flaws.</p>\n<p id=\"b44-6\">First, we agree with the state that the defendant\u2019s foundation is wholly speculative. Simply because the victim and Hunt allegedly had been in a fight does not necessarily mean that their relationship was not close and that his reason for not cooperating with the police on May 30, 2005, was false. Indeed, much of the cross-examination of the victim by defense counsel revealed that, as of May 30, 2005, the victim had what appeared to be a very close relationship with Hunt. Specifically, in response to questioning by Franklin\u2019s attorney, the victim confirmed that he had told the police that he just wanted to go to his girlfriend\u2019s house after the shooting and to have her take him to the hospital. Subsequently, defense counsel questioned the victim about notations in his hospital records that referred to Hunt as his fianc\u00e9e or his wife. It simply strains credulity that the victim would have made or acquiesced in these contemporaneous statements with the forethought that, one year later, at the defendant\u2019s trial, the victim would use them as the basis for a he during his cross-examination.</p>\n<p id=\"b44-7\">Second, the defendant\u2019s foundation is insufficient because defense counsel never represented to the court <em>when </em>the victim allegedly assaulted Hunt. If the assault occurred after May 30, 2005, then it could not have had any bearing on the closeness of the victim\u2019s relationship with Hunt or his decision not to cooperate with the police on that date. In sum, defense counsel failed to demonstrate any open and visible connection between the alleged fight with Hunt and the victim\u2019s decision not to tell the police the identities of his assailants on May 30, 2005. Accordingly, the trial court did not abuse its discretion in ruling that the inquiry of the defendant\u2019s attorney was irrelevant, and the court\u2019s decision to preclude it on that basis did not violate the defendant\u2019s <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"25\">*25</page-number>sixth amendment rights to confrontation and to present a defense. See, e.g., <em>State </em>v. <em>King, </em>249 Conn. 645, 668, 735 A.2d 267 (1999) (\u201c[i]f the proffered evidence is not relevant, the defendant\u2019s right to confrontation is not affected, and the evidence was properly excluded\u201d [internal quotation marks omitted]).</p>\n<p id=\"b45-6\">Ill</p>\n<p id=\"b45-7\">The defendant\u2019s third claim is that the trial court improperly precluded his attorney from impeaching the victim with the facts underlying his conviction of possession of a weapon in a motor vehicle and with the name of that offense after the victim testified that he did not carry a gun on May 30, 2005, or \u201con other days . . . .\u201d We disagree.</p>\n<p id=\"b45-8\">The following additional facts and procedural history are relevant to this claim. Before the start of trial, the state\u2019s attorney informed the court that the victim had a previous felony conviction of possession of a weapon in a motor vehicle. The state\u2019s attorney argued that, because this felony did not relate to the victim\u2019s truth and veracity, defense counsel should not be permitted to question the victim about the name of the felony. The court agreed and ruled that this crime could be referred to only as an unnamed felony. The defendant\u2019s attorney did not object to this ruling.</p>\n<p id=\"b45-9\">On direct examination, the state\u2019s attorney asked the victim if he previously had been convicted of a felony, to which the victim responded, \u201c[y]es.\u201d On cross-examination by Franklin\u2019s attorney, the victim agreed that selling drugs is sometimes a \u201cviolent enterprise\u201d but denied having carried a gun on May 30, 2005. Franklin\u2019s attorney then asked: \u201cYou [have] carried guns on other days, haven\u2019t you?\u201d The state\u2019s attorney immediately objected to this question on the ground of relevance. Before the court could rule on the objection, the victim replied, \u201c[n]o.\u201d Franklin\u2019s attorney then asked the vie-<page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"26\">*26</page-number>tim the name of the felony of which he had been convicted. The state\u2019s attorney objected again, and the court sustained the objection, ruling that this line of inquiry was irrelevant. The defendant\u2019s attorney then interjected and argued that the victim had \u201copened the door\u201d to this question by testifying that he never had carried a gun. In response, the court reiterated that the objection had been sustained.</p>\n<p id=\"b46-6\">On appeal, the defendant claims that the victim opened the door to cross-examination about carrying a gun when he (1) admitted that he was engaged in drug selling when the May 30, 2005 incident occurred, (2) admitted that selling drugs was a \u201cviolent enterprise,\u201d and (3) testified that he did not carry a gun on May 30,2005, or on any other day. The defendant claims that the last statement was contradicted by the victim\u2019s conviction for possession of a weapon in a motor vehicle and, therefore, was proper fodder for impeachment. See <em>State </em>v. <em>Denby, </em>198 Conn. 23, 31-33, 501 A.2d 1206 (1985), cert. denied, 475 U.S. 1097, 106 S. Ct. 1497, 89 L. Ed. 2d 898 (1986).</p>\n<p id=\"b46-7\">We conclude that the trial court did not abuse its discretion in ruling that the inquiry was irrelevant and precluding it on that basis. At the outset, we note that the defendant\u2019s first and second bases for his claim that the victim had opened the door to this line of inquiry were not raised at trial and otherwise lack merit. The only conceivable relevance of Franklin\u2019s attorney\u2019s question regarding the name of the victim\u2019s felony was to contradict the victim\u2019s testimony that he did not carry guns on any other day. This is not a case in which the defendant has raised a claim of self-defense, accident, or other claim that would make the victim\u2019s possession of a gun on the day of the shooting or any other day \u201crelevant to the central factual issue presented by the evidence.\u201d Id., 31. The defendant\u2019s sole theory of the case is that the victim mistakenly identified the <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"27\">*27</page-number>defendant as one of his assailants. Therefore, the defendant\u2019s argument that the victim opened the door to the question posed by Franklin\u2019s attorney when the victim admitted (1) that he was engaged in drug selling when the May 30, 2005 incident occurred, and (2) that selling drugs was a \u201cviolent enterprise,\u201d is unavailing.</p>\n<p id=\"b47-6\">We further conclude that the defendant\u2019s third basis for his claim fails because defense counsel did not lay a proper foundation to demonstrate that the victim\u2019s testimony was, in fact, contradicted by his prior conviction of possession of a weapon in a motor vehicle. \u201cA witness may be impeached by the introduction of contradictory evidence <em>... as long as the evidence is in fact contradictory </em>. . . .\u201d (Emphasis added.) <em>State </em>v. <em>Jose G., </em>290 Conn. 331, 344, 963 A.2d 42 (2009). In the present case, the victim testified that he had not <em>carried guns </em>\u201con other days . . . .\u201d This statement is not necessarily contradicted by the <em>fact that he was </em>convicted of possession of a <em>weapon </em>in a motor vehicle under General Statutes \u00a7 29-38 because \u00a7 29-38 punishes both the unlawful possession of firearms and \u201cweapons.\u201d General Statutes \u00a7 29-38 (a) defines the term \u201cweapon\u201d as follows: \u201c[A]ny BB. gun, any blackjack, any metal or brass knuckles, any police baton or nightstick, any dirk knife or switch knife, any knife having an automatic spring release device by which a blade is released from the handle, having a blade of over one and one-half inches in length, any stiletto, any knife the edged portion of the blade of which is four inches or over in length, any martial arts weapon or electronic defense weapon, as defined in section 53a-3, or any other dangerous or deadly weapon or instrument.\u201d Defense counsel failed to make an offer of proof specifying the type of weapon that the victim was convicted of possessing under \u00a7 29-38. In addition, even if the victim was convicted of possessing a gun in a motor vehicle, \u201cpossession\u201d does not necessarily mean \u201ccar<page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"28\">*28</page-number>rying.\u201d To be convicted under \u00a7 29-38, a person need only \u201cknowingly ha[ve], in any vehicle owned, operated or occupied by such person, any weapon . . . .\u201d General Statutes \u00a7 29-38 (a). Thus, defense counsel failed to make an offer of proof specifying that the victim\u2019s conviction under \u00a7 29-38 involved the \u201ccarrying\u201d of a gun on his person, rather than, for example, knowing that one was in the trunk of his car. Accordingly, defense counsel failed to establish a proper foundation that the evidence was, in fact, contradictory, and, therefore, we conclude that the trial court properly characterized it as irrelevant and precluded it on that basis. See <em>State </em>v. <em>Hines, </em>163 Conn. 617, 619, 316 A.2d 392 (1972) (because crime of policy playing under General Statutes [Cum. Sup. 1965] \u00a7 53-298 was broadly defined, \u201cevidence of conviction for policy playing, without specification of the particular act constituting the offense, in no way contradicted the testimony of the defendant with respect to the taking of any bet [and, therefore] [i]t was error to admit the evidence\u201d); cf. <em>State </em>v. <em>L\u2019Heureux, </em>166 Conn. 312, 323, 348 A.2d 578 (1974) (\u201c[e]vidence of convictions for nonsupport during a previous marriage did not contradict the testimony that at the time of trial the defendant considered himself a family man\u201d [internal quotation marks omitted]). See generally <em>State </em>v. <em>Pratt, </em>supra, 235 Conn. 605 (\u201c[ujnless ... a proper foundation is established, the evidence . . . is irrelevant\u201d [internal quotation marks omitted]). Because the trial court did not abuse its discretion in ruling that the evidence was irrelevant, the defendant\u2019s sixth amendment rights to confrontation and to present a defense were not violated. See <em>State </em>v. <em>King, </em>supra, 249 Conn. 668.</p>\n<p id=\"b48-6\">rv</p>\n<p id=\"b48-7\">The defendant\u2019s final claim is that the trial court improperly precluded his attorney from questioning the victim about his abusive and profane conduct before a <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"29\">*29</page-number>Superior Court judge in 2004 and about a profane tattoo that the victim allegedly had, which concerned his disdain for the police. We disagree.</p>\n<p id=\"b49-6\">The following additional facts and procedural history are relevant to this claim. During cross-examination of the victim by Franklin\u2019s attorney, the victim admitted that he had been in Superior Court in 2004 on a felony charge and remembered \u201cgetting into it\u201d with a judge. Franklin\u2019s attorney asked the victim whether he had told the judge that his name was \u201cElliot Fucking Snider.\u201d The victim responded that he did not remember saying that. Franklin\u2019s attorney then continued to ask the same question two more times, at which point the state\u2019s attorney objected on the ground of relevance. The trial court sustained the objection, noting that the victim had stated that he did not recall making that statement.</p>\n<p id=\"b49-7\">On cross-examination by the defendant\u2019s attorney, the defendant\u2019s attorney again asked the victim if he had used the name \u201cElliot Fucking Snider\u201d in court in 2004. The state\u2019s attorney objected on the ground of relevance. The defendant\u2019s attorney claimed that the inquiry was relevant insofar as it concerned the victim\u2019s \u201c [a]bility to perceive and recall events.\u201d The court noted that the victim previously had responded to this question but overruled the state\u2019s attorney\u2019s objection. The victim then responded that he had had \u201can incident with a judge\u201d but that he did not make that specific statement. The defendant\u2019s attorney then asked the victim whether the incident with the judge involved his telling the judge to \u201cfuck off\u2019 twenty-seven times. The state\u2019s attorney again objected on the ground of relevance, and the trial court sustained the objection. The defendant\u2019s attorney argued that the inquiry was relevant to the victim\u2019s credibility and his ability to perceive and recall events, and asked that the transcript of the victim\u2019s 2004 Superior Court hearing be marked for <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"30\">*30</page-number>identification. The court again sustained the objection, noting that the transcript was from 2004, whereas the shootings at issue in the present case did not occur until 2005.<footnotemark>12</footnotemark></p>\n<p id=\"b50-6\">Following the court\u2019s ruling, the defendant\u2019s attorney continued to question the victim about other inappropriate statements that the victim allegedly had made in court in 2004. The state\u2019s attorney objected to this line of questioning on the ground of relevance, and the court sustained the objection, informing the defendant\u2019s attorney: \u201c[T]his was sustained before. Stop it.\u201d The court then directed the defendant\u2019s attorney to focus on the issues before the jury, that is, the alleged shootings in 2005, and not on what happened in 2004.</p>\n<p id=\"b50-7\">Later in his cross-examination, the defendant\u2019s attorney asked the victim whether he \u201clike[d] the police.\u201d The state\u2019s attorney objected on the ground of relevance, and the court sustained the objection, stating, \u201cwhether he likes them or not is not relevant . . . .\u201d The defendant\u2019s attorney then asked the victim why he had a tattoo with the words \u201cfuck the police\u201d on his arm. The state\u2019s attorney again objected on the ground of relevance. The defendant\u2019s attorney claimed that the question was relevant to the issue of the victim\u2019s lack of cooperation with the police \u201cversus his excuse . . . .\u201d The court noted that the victim had not cooperated with the police and then sustained the objection.</p>\n<p id=\"b50-8\">On appeal, the defendant claims that his attorney\u2019s inquiries were relevant on a number of bases. First, the defendant claims that exposing the victim\u2019s \u201cchangeable character in court proceedings\u201d would have given the jury \u201can opportunity to be better informed\u201d about <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"31\">*31</page-number>the victim and \u201cthe sort of person\u201d that he is. Second, the defendant argues that the victim\u2019s denial of having stated in court that his name was \u201cElliot Fucking Snider\u201d was an inconsistency under \u00a7 6-10 of the Connecticut Code of Evidence and supported the defendant\u2019s claim that the victim had a \u201crecollection problem.\u201d Third, the defendant claims that the victim\u2019s outburst in court was relevant to his defense that the victim had mental health issues, including \u201c \u2018intermittent explosive disorder\u2019 \u201d and \u201cparanoia . . . .\u201d Fourth, the defendant claims that the alleged tattoo on the victim\u2019s arm \u201cwas another insight into his credibility . . . [and] showed his explosive and paranoid personality . . . [and] a bias against the police . . . .\u201d (Citations omitted.)</p>\n<p id=\"b51-6\">We conclude that the trial court did not abuse its discretion when it sustained the state\u2019s attorney\u2019s objections to the inquiries regarding the victim\u2019s alleged tattoo and conduct before a judge in 2004 because the evidence that the defendant sought to elicit is barred by the Connecticut Code of Evidence and our common law. Section 4-5 (a) of the Connecticut Code of Evidence provides: \u201cEvidence of other crimes, wrongs or acts of a person is inadmissible to prove the bad character or criminal tendencies of that person.\u201d In the present case, the defendant contends that his attorney sought to elicit evidence of the victim\u2019s conduct before a Superior Court judge in 2004 for the purpose of exposing the victim\u2019s \u201cchangeable character in court proceedings\u201d so that the jury could be \u201cbetter informed\u201d about \u201cthe sort of person\u201d that the victim is. Clearly, the defendant\u2019s attorney sought to prove that the victim was a bad \u201csort of person . . . .\u201d When evidence is offered for this purpose, it is expressly prohibited by \u00a7 4-5 (a) of the Connecticut Code of Evidence.</p>\n<p id=\"b51-7\">The defendant\u2019s claim that the trial court improperly precluded his attorney from impeaching the victim with <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"32\">*32</page-number>the transcript from the 2004 court hearing after the victim denied having stated at that hearing that his name was \u201cElliot Fucking Snider\u201d also is without merit. \u201cAs a general rule, extrinsic evidence of a prior inconsistent statement<footnotemark>13</footnotemark> may not be admitted to impeach the testimony of a witness on a collateral matter. . . . Thus ... a witness\u2019 answer regarding a collateral matter is conclusive and cannot be contradicted later by extrinsic evidence. . . . Extrinsic evidence of a prior inconsistent statement may be admitted, however, to impeach a witness\u2019 testimony on a <em>noncollateral </em>matter. ... A matter is not collateral if it is relevant to a material issue in the case apart from its tendency to contradict the witness. . . . The determination of whether a matter is relevant to a material issue or is collateral generally rests within the sound discretion of the trial court.\u201d (Citations omitted; emphasis in original.) <em>State </em>v. <em>Valentine, </em>240 Conn. 395, 403, 692 A.2d 727 (1997). In the present case, whether the victim told a judge in 2004 that his name was \u201cElliot Fucking Snider\u201d is a collateral matter because it is not relevant to any material issue in this case. Specifically, it is not relevant to whether the victim properly identified the defendant as his assailant, and it does not show any possible motive, bias or interest of the victim. Accordingly, the trial court properly exercised its discretion when it excluded the 2004 transcript because it is extrinsic evidence of a collateral matter.</p>\n<p id=\"b53-5\"><page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"33\">*33</page-number>The defendant\u2019s final claim that the victim\u2019s alleged tattoo and outburst in court in 2004 were relevant to the victim\u2019s credibility and the defendant\u2019s defense that the victim had mental health issues also is unavailing. First, the victim\u2019s alleged tattoo and outburst in court are not probative of his character for untruthfulness. Accordingly, those inquiries were not permissible under \u00a7 6-6 of the Connecticut Code of Evidence,<footnotemark>14</footnotemark> which permits inquiries about specific instances of conduct that are probative of a witness\u2019 character for untruthfulness.</p>\n<p id=\"b53-6\">Second, we conclude that the trial court did not abuse its discretion in ruling that the evidence regarding the tattoo was inadmissible to establish that the victim had failed to cooperate with or had a bias against the police. As the trial court observed, the victim admitted that he did not cooperate with the police on May 30, 2005. Thus, his lack of cooperation was undisputed, and any additional evidence to establish that fact would have been cumulative. In addition, the defendant\u2019s attorney failed to lay a proper foundation for the tattoo evidence because there was no claim or evidence that the victim had the tattoo at the time of the shooting.</p>\n<p id=\"b54-5\"><page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"34\">*34</page-number>Finally, we conclude that the trial court did not abuse its discretion in excluding the evidence of the alleged tattoo and the victim\u2019s outburst in court because the defendant\u2019s attorney had failed to lay a proper foundation that the victim had a mental health condition at the time he received the tattoo and had his outburst in court. According to the evidence at trial, the victim was not diagnosed with paranoia until after the first shooting in 2005. Thus, the defendant\u2019s claim that this evidence supported his defense is based solely on conjecture. Because the trial court did not abuse its discretion in precluding the defendant\u2019s attorney from questioning the victim about these matters, the defendant\u2019s sixth amendment rights to confrontation and to present a defense were not violated.
