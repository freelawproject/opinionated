The board concluded that the commissioner had the authority to impose sanctions against the association, that the sanctions were part of a \u201ccovered claim\u201d under General Statutes \u00a7 38a-838 (5),<footnotemark>7</footnotemark> which the association is obligated to pay in accordance with General Statutes \u00a7 38a-841 (1) (a) and (b),<footnotemark>8</footnotemark> and <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"624\">*624</page-number>that the association is not immune from sanctions by virtue of General Statutes \u00a7 38a-850.<footnotemark>9</footnotemark> The defendant claims that the board improperly determined that the commissioner has the authority to impose sanctions on the association and specifically argues that the board improperly (1) applied the Appellate Court\u2019s decision in <em>Pantanella </em>v. <em>Enfield Ford, Inc., </em>65 Conn. App. 46, 53, 782 A.2d 141, cert. denied, 258 Conn. 930, 783 A.2d 1029 (2001), to the facts of the present case, and (2) determined that the association is obligated to pay the sanctions because \u00a7 38a-850 provides a broad grant of immunity to the association, including immunity from sanctions, the sanctions imposed are not part of a \u201ccovered claim\u201d within the meaning of \u00a7 38a-838 (5), and the association cannot be \u201cdeemed the insurer\u201d under \u00a7 38a-841 (1) (b). The plaintiff responds that the board properly upheld the imposition of sanctions.<footnotemark>10</footnotemark> We agree <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"625\">*625</page-number>with the defendant that the association is statutorily immune from the sanctions imposed in the present case and that the sanctions are not part of a \u201ccovered claim\u201d within the meaning of \u00a7 38a-838 (5). Accordingly, we reverse the decision of the board.</p>\n<p id=\"b645-5\">The board found the following undisputed facts relevant to this appeal. \u201cThe [plaintiff] suffered a compensa-ble injury in 2000, which was accepted by his employer, Lincoln Service and Equipment [Company], in 2001. At that time, a voluntary agreement was approved by the [workers\u2019 compensation] commission. The [plaintiff] had a knee replacement surgery performed in 2003 but, following the procedure, continued to complain of knee pain. [The association\u2019s] umbrella organization, [the defendant],<footnotemark>11</footnotemark> had the [plaintiff] examined by . . . MacEllis Glass [a physician] on January 12, 2005. . . . Glass strongly recommended that the [plaintiff] be <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"626\">*626</page-number>examined by another physician for consideration of a patellar replacement. [The defendant] authorized the [plaintiff] to be examined by a second [physician], [namely] John Grady-Benson, who noted an antalgic limp and recommended a bone scan of the patella. He also recommended [a magnetic resonance image (MRI)] of the [plaintiffs] lower spine to determine if he had a neurological disorder due to the right knee replacement. . . . Grady-Benson examined the [plaintiff] on April 6, 2005, and submitted a bill in the amount of $343 for the examination.</p>\n<p id=\"b646-5\">\u201c[Although] this bill was properly submitted to [the defendant], it was not paid until September 15, 2005. During this period, an adjuster for [the defendant], Kristen Rogers, prepared an authorization for the [plaintiffs] MRI but decided not to issue the authorization, claiming [that] \u2018she [had] realized the back injury was not part of the compensable injury.\u2019 . . . Rogers claimed she orally authorized the bone scan in August, 2005. Counsel for [the defendant] offered to pay for the bone scan on September 1, 2005, on a \u2018without prejudice\u2019 basis but demurred on the issue of the MRI. Following an informal hearing before [the] commissioner ... on February 15, 2006, [the defendant] finally provided written authorization for the bone scan and [the] MRI.</p>\n<p id=\"b646-6\">\u201cFollowing [the defendant\u2019s authorization of] these medical tests, the [plaintiff] encountered numerous difficulties in getting [the defendant] to guarantee payment to Hartford Hospital for these tests. The [plaintiff] presented himself twice for the tests, both on July 10,2006, and July 11, 2006, and both times Hartford Hospital declined to perform the tests due to inadequate assurances of payment. The [plaintiff] then had the tests [covered by] private group insurance for which a $100 <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"627\">*627</page-number>co-pay was assessed.<footnotemark>12</footnotemark> . . . Seven workers\u2019 compensation hearings [were] held on these issues, including two formal hearings on November 20, 2006, and January 16, 2007, to discuss the unreasonable contest and undue delay of benefits. The . . . commissioner found that [the defendant] did not provide any medical reports that justified the delay in paying . . . Grady-Benson or [the delay in] scheduling . . . the MRI and bone scan recommended by . . . Grady-Benson.</p>\n<p id=\"b647-5\">\u201cIn his [f]inding and [a]ward of July 27, 2007, [the] commissioner . . . concluded that [the defendant had] unreasonably contested and delayed medical treatment benefits for the [plaintiffs] compensable knee injury . . . [and found that the defendant had] lacked a reasonable basis to delay payment for treatment, to contest the need for treatment, or to contest or delay the recommended diagnostic tests for the [plaintiff]. The commissioner concluded that the unreasonable delay of benefits was due to [the defendant\u2019s] own fault and neglect in handling the claim. The commissioner did not find any monetary benefits were delayed for which interest could be granted. The commissioner further found that the undue delay in medical treatment caused the [plaintiffs] attorney to expend substantially more time representing his client than would be reasonably expected. Therefore, pursuant to \u00a7 31-300 . . . the . . . commissioner ordered [the defendant] to pay [the plaintiffs] counsel $8000 to compensate for [forty] hours of legal time occasioned by the unreasonable delay, and penalized [the defendant] $500 pursuant to \u00a7 31-288 (b) (1) .... The [defendant and the plaintiffs employer] filed a motion to correct, seeking to interpose factual find<page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"628\">*628</page-number>ings that [the defendant] did not act unreasonably and . . . [that the defendant was] legally immune from sanction. The . . . commissioner denied [the motion], and [the] appeal [to the board followed].\u201d</p>\n<p id=\"b648-5\">The board concluded that the commissioner had properly imposed sanctions against the association<footnotemark>13</footnotemark> for its undue delay in processing the plaintiffs claim. In its decision, the board first concluded that the facts of <em>Pantanella </em>v. <em>Enfield Ford, Inc., </em>supra, 65 Conn. App. 53, in which the Appellate Court upheld the award of attorney\u2019s fees, pursuant to \u00a7 31-300, against the association in another context, were \u201cindistinguishable\u201d from the facts of the present case, thereby requiring the board to abide by that decision unless the \u201cinescapable logic\u201d of the defendant\u2019s arguments required the board to overturn the commissioner\u2019s decision. (Internal quotation marks omitted.) The board then addressed the defendant\u2019s claim that the commissioner was without authority to impose sanctions on the association. The board concluded that [the association] was \u201cdeemed the insurer\u201d under \u00a7 38a-841 (1) (b) because the sanctions were part of a \u201ccovered claim\u201d within the meaning of \u00a7 38a-838 (5), thereby subjecting the association to the commissioner\u2019s authority to impose sanctions on an insurer under \u00a7\u00a7 31-288 (b) (1) and 31-300. Additionally, the board concluded that the immunity provision of General Statutes \u00a7 38a-850, which provides that the association shall incur \u201cno liability\u201d for \u201cany action taken or any failure to act\u201d under the guaranty act, could not be read to divest the commissioner of the authority to impose sanctions under the Workers\u2019 Com<page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"629\">*629</page-number>pensation Act. The board concluded that, in addition to the statutory authority to impose sanctions, the commissioner also had the \u201ccommon-law power to enforce orders of the tribunal,\u201d<footnotemark>14</footnotemark> including \u201cthe right to sanction parties for violating orders of the tribunal.\u201d<footnotemark>15</footnotemark> For these reasons, the board concluded that the commissioner had the authority to impose sanctions against the association and it upheld the commissioner\u2019s imposition of sanctions and award of attorney\u2019s fees. This appeal followed.</p>\n<p id=\"b649-5\">I</p>\n<p id=\"b649-6\">The association is a creature of statute, and any basis for liability must be found within the provisions of the guaranty act, which define the scope and extent of the association\u2019s liability. See, e.g., <em>Esposito </em>v. <em>Simkins Industries, Inc., </em>286 Conn. 319, 338, 943 A.2d 456 (2007) (\u201cthe association\u2019s liability is dictated by the guaranty act\u201d); cf. <em>Hunnihan </em>v. <em>Mattatuck Mfg. Co., </em>243 Conn. 438, 449, 705 A.2d 1012 (1997) (\u201cthe association is authorized to pay only covered claims . . . and must deny all other claims\u201d). Therefore, we turn first to the question of whether the guaranty act obligates the association to pay the sanctions imposed by the commissioner.</p>\n<p id=\"b649-7\">A</p>\n<p id=\"b649-8\">The defendant first claims that the plain meaning of \u00a7 38a-850 grants the association immunity from the <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"630\">*630</page-number>sanctions imposed in the present case. The relevant portion of that statute provides: \u201cThere shall be no liability on the part of and no cause of action of any nature shall arise against . . . [the] association or its agents or employees ... for any action taken or any failure to act by them in the performance of their powers and duties under sections 38a-836 to 38a-853,<footnotemark>16</footnotemark> inclusive.\u201d General Statutes \u00a7 38a-850. The board concluded that, because the phrases \u201cno liability\u201d and \u201cno cause of action\u201d are not defined in the statute, the meaning of each phrase is ambiguous. The board acknowledged that \u00a7 38a-850 may afford the association immunity against tort and contract actions but concluded that this immunity did not extend to sanctions imposed by a workers\u2019 compensation commissioner for undue delay in handling claims because the association\u2019s ability to delay claims without consequence could interfere \u201cwith the state\u2019s statutory obligation to operate an effective system of workers\u2019 compensation.\u201d (Internal quotation marks omitted.) On appeal, the defendant argues that the board incorrectly concluded that the association was not immune from sanctions under \u00a7 38a-850 because the plain meaning of the phrase \u201cno liability . . . for any action taken or any failure to act\u201d in \u00a7 38a-850 includes penalties imposed by the commissioner against the association for the performance of any of its duties under the guaranty act, including the processing of workers\u2019 compensation claims. The plaintiff maintains that the board properly determined that the meaning of \u201cno liability\u201d is ambiguous and that the board\u2019s limited interpretation of \u00a7 38a-850 was reasonable. We agree with the defendant.</p>\n<p id=\"b650-5\">We begin by setting forth the applicable standard of review. Our courts generally give great deference to the decision of an administrative agency and will disturb <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"631\">*631</page-number>that decision only when the evidence in the record demonstrates that \u201cthe agency has acted unreasonably, arbitrarily, illegally or in abuse of its discretion.\u201d (Internal quotation marks omitted.) <em>Thomas </em>v. <em>Dept. of Developmental Services, </em>297 Conn. 391, 398, 999 A.2d 682 (2010). When the case before the court presents only \u201cpure questions of law,\u201d however, the standard of review is broader unless an agency\u2019s interpretation of a statute has previously been scrutinized by the courts or is \u201ctime-tested . . . .\u201d Id. Because the interpretation of a statute raises only a pure question of law, and there is no claim that an agency\u2019s interpretation of the statutes relevant to this appeal has been time-tested or subject to prior judicial scrutiny, we exercise plenary review over the board\u2019s decision. See id., 399.</p>\n<p id=\"b651-5\">When interpreting a statute, \u201c[o]ur fundamental objective is to ascertain and give effect to the apparent intent of the legislature. ... In other words, we seek to determine, in a reasoned manner, the meaning of the statutory language as applied to the facts of [the] case, including the question of whether the language actually does apply.\u201d (Internal quotation marks omitted.) <em>Picco </em>v. <em>Voluntown, </em>295 Conn. 141, 147, 989 A.2d 593 (2010). General Statutes \u00a7 l-2z<footnotemark>17</footnotemark> requires this court first to consider the text of the statute and its relationship to other statutes to determine its meaning. If, after such consideration, the meaning of the statutory text is plain and unambiguous and does not yield absurd or unworkable results, we cannot consider extratextual evidence of the meaning of the statute. E.g., <em>Saunders </em>v. <em>Firtel, </em>293 Conn. 515, 525, 978 A.2d 487 (2009). Only if we determine that the text of the statute is not plain and unam<page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"632\">*632</page-number>biguous may we look to extratextual evidence of its meaning, such as \u201cthe legislative history and circumstances surrounding its enactment . . . the legislative policy it was designed to implement, and ... its relationship to existing legislation and common law principles governing the same general subject matter . . . .\u201d (Internal quotation marks omitted.) <em>Thomas </em>v. <em>Dept. of Developmental </em>Services, supra, 297 Conn. 399. The proper test to determine whether the meaning of the text of a statute is ambiguous is \u201cwhether the statute, when read in context, is susceptible to more than one reasonable interpretation.\u201d (Internal quotation marks omitted.) Id.</p>\n<p id=\"b652-5\">In accordance with \u00a7 l-2z, we begin our analysis with the text of the statute. The relevant portion of General Statutes \u00a7 38a-850 provides that \u201c[t]here shall be no liability on the part of and no cause of action of any nature shall arise against . . . [the] association or its agents or employees . . . for any action taken or any failure to act by them in the performance of their powers and duties under [the guaranty act].\u201d The language of the statute can be broken into two parts. The first part of the statute provides a general rule vesting the association with immunity from \u201cliability\u201d and any \u201ccause of action . . . .\u201d General Statutes \u00a7 38a-850. The second part of the statute limits the extent of the immunity granted to only those liabilities resulting from \u201cany action taken or any failure to act ... in the performance of [the association\u2019s] powers and duties under [the guaranty act].\u201d General Statutes \u00a7 38a-850. Thus, our resolution of this issue will turn on whether (1) sanctions imposed by a workers\u2019 compensation commissioner are a \u201cliability\u201d within the meaning of \u00a7 38a-850, and (2) the phrase \u201cany action taken or any failure to act ... in the performance of [the association\u2019s] powers and duties\u201d encompasses undue delay in processing a claim under the Workers\u2019 Compensation Act.</p>\n<p id=\"b653-4\"><page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"633\">*633</page-number>1</p>\n<p id=\"b653-5\">We turn first to the issue of whether the term \u201cliability\u201d in \u00a7 38a-850 encompasses statutory sanctions imposed by a workers\u2019 compensation commissioner. The guaranty act does not define the term \u201cliability.\u201d When a statute does not provide a definition, \u201cwords and phrases in a particular statute are to be construed according to their common usage. ... To ascertain that usage, we look to the dictionary definition of the term.\u201d (Internal quotation marks omitted.) <em>Picco </em>v. <em>Voluntown, </em>supra, 295 Conn. 148; see also General Statutes \u00a7 1-1 (a).<footnotemark>18</footnotemark> Webster\u2019s Third New International Dictionary defines \u201cliability\u201d as \u201csomething for which one is liable ... as ... an amount that is owed whether payable in money, other property, or services,\u201d and defines \u201cliable\u201d as \u201cbound or obligated according to law or equity . . . .\u201d The sanctions imposed in the present case constitute \u201can amount that is owed [and] . . . payable in money,\u201d and an amount that the association is otherwise \u201cbound or obligated\u201d to pay. Webster\u2019s Third New International Dictionary. In his decision, the commissioner ordered the defendant to \u201cpay a fine of $500\u201d and to \u201cpay the [plaintiff attorney\u2019s] fees in the amount of $8000\u201d pursuant to \u00a7 31-288 (b) and \u00a7 31-300, respectively. Because the commissioner\u2019s imposition of sanctions obligated the association to pay an amount of money, we conclude that these sanctions fall within the plain meaning of the term \u201cliability\u201d in \u00a7 38a-850.<footnotemark>19</footnotemark></p>\n<p id=\"b654-4\"><page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"634\">*634</page-number>The plaintiff argues that there is an \u201cobvious ambiguity\u201d in the term \u201cliability\u201d because \u201cliability\u201d could have more than one reasonable meaning, and urges us to restrict its meaning. Specifically, the plaintiff argues that \u201c \u2018[liability\u2019 could mean that [the association] is exempt only from civil liability arising out of direct actions brought against it\u201d or \u201ccould mean that [it] is exempt from claims for excess coverage when ... a verdict results in damages beyond the policy coverage.\u201d The plaintiff contends that the meaning of \u201cliability\u201d should not include sanctions imposed by the commissioner and that the association should be obligated to pay them. The plaintiff essentially would have us interpret \u00a7 38a-850 as providing that there are some liabilities that the association is responsible for \u201cin the performance of [its] powers and duties\u201d under the guaranty act despite the broad, clear phrasing of the statute that \u201c[t]here shall be no liability . . . .\u201d General Statutes \u00a7 38a-850. In effect, the plaintiff reads out of the statute the word \u201cno,\u201d which immediately precedes the word \u201cliability,\u201d and, instead, reads into the statute the word \u201csome\u201d immediately before the word \u201cliability.\u201d This reading is not supported by the text of \u00a7 38a-850. Consistent with the plain language of the statute, we conclude that \u201cno liability\u201d means no liability and is clear and unambiguous.</p>\n<p id=\"b654-5\">2</p>\n<p id=\"b654-6\">Having determined that the sanctions imposed in this case are a \u201cliability\u201d within the plain meaning of \u00a7 38a-850, we now turn to the issue of whether this liability arose out of \u201cany action taken or any failure to act\u201d by the association or its agent \u201cin the performance of [its] powers and duties under [the guaranty act].\u201d General Statutes \u00a7 38a-850. We conclude that the facts of the present case fall within this limitation.</p>\n<p id=\"b654-7\">First, the association\u2019s liability for undue delay resulted from the failure of its agent, namely, the defen<page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"635\">*635</page-number>dant, to pay a claim and from the defendant\u2019s failure to approve medical treatment. Put another way, the association\u2019s liability arose from the defendant\u2019s failure to act. Second, the failure to act occurred during the performance of the association\u2019s statutory duties under the guaranty act. The association\u2019s obligation to pay a claim for workers\u2019 compensation benefits on behalf of an insolvent insurer arises under \u00a7 38a-841 (1), which is found in the guaranty act. See <em>Esposito </em>v. <em>Simkins Industries, Inc., </em>supra, 286 Conn. 338-39 (association\u2019s obligation to pay claim derives from provisions of guaranty act). Because the duty to process a covered workers\u2019 compensation claim arises under \u00a7 38a-841 (1), the processing of such a claim is one of the association\u2019s \u201cpowers and duties under sections 38a-836 to 38a-853, inclusive.\u201d General Statutes \u00a7 38a-850. Accordingly, we conclude that the sanctions that the commissioner imposed are a liability that arises from the failure of the association, or its agent, to act during the performance of its statutory duties and that these sanctions fit squarely into the type of liability that \u00a7 38a-850 seeks to avoid. Thus, \u00a7 38a-850 affords the association immunity from the sanctions imposed by the commissioner.</p>\n<p id=\"b655-5\">The plaintiff argues that interpreting \u00a7 38a-850 to include sanctions by the commissioner will produce absurd and unworkable results. The plaintiff posits that a broad reading of the statute is absurd because, under such a reading, the association would be immune from insurance regulation, discovery sanctions, and even from sanctions imposed by a court, and would not be \u201c[subject] to any liabilities for any misconduct . . . including . . . fraudulent or intentionally tortious conduct.\u201d The plaintiff further asserts that the association could act with impunity and \u201crefuse to comply with any . . . order [of a workers\u2019 compensation commissioner or the insurance commissioner] without any liability.\u201d The plaintiff argues that, for these reasons, we <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"636\">*636</page-number>must conclude that \u201c[s]uch an inteipretation of \u00a7 [38a-850] is absurd and therefore must be rejected in favor of ... a [more] reasonable result.\u201d (Internal quotation marks omitted.) The plaintiff suggests that \u00a7 38a-850 is more reasonably interpreted to mean only \u201cthat [the association] enjoys immunity from liability for a <em>direct </em>action brought against it in the performance of its duties [and] not for sanctions [imposed by the commissioner].\u201d (Emphasis added.)</p>\n<p id=\"b656-5\">We disagree that construing \u00a7 38a-850 to provide immunity from sanctions would produce an absurd or unworkable result by permitting the association to act with impunity or to refuse to comply with any order of a workers\u2019 compensation commissioner or the insurance commissioner. The immunity conferred on the association by \u00a7 38a-850 extends only to acts or a failure to act \u201cin the performance of [its] powers and duties\u201d under the guaranty act. General Statutes \u00a7 38a-850. Although \u00a7 38a-850 affords the association immunity from liability that arises while performing its duties, it does not dispense with the association\u2019s underlying obligation to perform those duties, including the duty to pay claims and to authorize treatment, under the guaranty act. Section 38a-841 (1) obligates the association to pay the underlying workers\u2019 compensation claim, and \u00a7 38a-850 does not insulate the association from this underlying statutory obligation. Indeed, the defendant concedes that, under \u00a7 38a-841 (2) (c),<footnotemark>20</footnotemark> the association may sue or be sued to compel it to \u201cpay covered claims that are within [the association\u2019s] statutory obligations\u201d as set forth in \u00a7 38a-841 (1). Thus, individual claimants are not left without a remedy to collect on their underlying claim or to enforce an order of a workers\u2019 compensation commissioner requiring the authorization of treatment.</p>\n<p id=\"b657-4\"><page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"637\">*637</page-number>Additionally, the immunity provision does not permit the association to act improperly in the handling of all claims without any consequences because other provisions of the guaranty act provide alternative mechanisms for ensuring that the association complies with its statutory obligations. The guaranty act gives the insurance commissioner considerable control over the association and the manner in which it carries out its statutory duties. For example, General Statutes \u00a7 38a-840<footnotemark>21</footnotemark> requires the insurance commissioner to approve the members of the association\u2019s board of directors, and General Statutes \u00a7 38a-842 (l)<footnotemark>22</footnotemark> provides that the insurance commissioner must approve any plan of operation for the association before such plan may take effect. Additionally, General Statutes \u00a7 38a-843 (2) (c)<footnotemark>23</footnotemark> provides a specific remedy for unsatisfactory claims handling by the association, or its agent, by empowering the insurance commissioner to \u201crevoke the designation of any servicing facility if he finds claims are being handled unsatisfactorily.\u201d At oral argument before this court, the defendant acknowledged that \u00a7 38a-843 (2) (c) would permit the insurance commissioner to revoke <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"638\">*638</page-number>the designation of the defendant as the association\u2019s \u201cservicing facility\u201d if he found that the defendant\u2019s handling of claims was unsatisfactory. The guaranty act also subjects the association to \u201cexamination and regulation\u201d by the insurance commissioner; General Statutes \u00a7 38a-847;<footnotemark>24</footnotemark> and General Statutes \u00a7 38a-853<footnotemark>25</footnotemark> empowers the insurance commissioner to promulgate regulations that are necessary to carry out the intent of the guaranty act. Reading \u00a7 38a-850 in relation to the foregoing statutes, we conclude that nothing in \u00a7 38a-850 abrogates the import of these provisions of the guaranty act.</p>\n<p id=\"b658-5\">Moreover, the inteipretation of \u00a7 38a-850 that the plaintiff urges finds no support in the text of the statute. General Statutes \u00a7 38a-850 provides in relevant part that \u201c[t]here shall be no liability on the part of and no cause of action of any nature shall arise against\u201d the association. The plaintiff asks us to restrict the meaning of this language to include only liability incurred from \u201cdirect actionjs]\u201d against the association. To do that, however, would read out the portion of the statute that provides that the association shall have no liability and that no cause of action of any nature shall arise against it. When a statute\u2019s plain and unambiguous language indicates that the statute is intended to have broader application, \u201cwe will not supply an exception or limitation to [that] statute . . . .\u201d <em>Manifold </em>v. <em>Ragaglia, </em>272 Conn. 410, 422, 862 A.2d 292 (2004); see id. (concluding that text of statutory immunity provision indicated that legislature intended for word \u201cany\u201d to have broad application). This result is no more absurd or unworkable than that of the sovereign immunity provisions of the <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"639\">*639</page-number>General Statutes, which provide immunity from liability that is similar to that granted to the association under \u00a7 38a-850.</p>\n<p id=\"b659-5\">3</p>\n<p id=\"b659-6\">In addition to its argument that the plain meaning of \u00a7 38a-850 provides immunity from sanctions imposed by the commissioner, the defendant argues that the immunity provision is consistent with the purpose and limitations of the guaranty act. The defendant asserts that, because the association is a nonprofit entity with limited ability to raise funds to cover insolvent insurers, and because a single insolvency can \u201cexponentially\u201d increase the demands on the association, the guaranty act vests the association with significant discretion in handling claims on behalf of those insurers. In response, the plaintiff contends that such reasoning is inapplicable because the legislature provided a statutory mechanism in \u00a7 38a-841 (1) (c)<footnotemark>26</footnotemark> that permits the association to delay payment because of a lack of funds resulting from a sudden increase in liabilities. Additionally, the plaintiff argues that our decisions in <em>Connecticut Ins. Guaranty Assn. </em>v. <em>State, </em>278 Conn. 77, 896 A.2d 747 (2006), and <em>Casey </em>v. <em>Northeast Utilities, </em>249 Conn. 365, 731 A.2d 294 (1999), indicate that we already have rejected similar arguments regarding the nature and purpose of the association.</p>\n<p id=\"b659-7\">Our conclusion in this case is consistent with our prior statements regarding the statutory purpose of the association. The association was created for the limited purpose of paying only \u201ccovered\u201d claims on behalf of insolvent insurers to insureds who otherwise would <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"640\">*640</page-number>be left with a limited recovery, if any, following the insolvency of their insurer. General Statutes \u00a7 38a-841 (1). The association does not replace the insolvent insurer and does not assume all of the insolvent insurer\u2019s responsibilities and obligations. The guaranty act limits the extent of the association\u2019s obligations so that the association remains a limited purpose entity rather than a full service insurer. This understanding is reflected in our prior discussions regarding the purpose of the association. In reaching our decision in <em>Hunni-han </em>v. <em>Mattatuck Mfg. Co., </em>supra, 243 Conn. 450-51, that the guaranty act excludes reimbursements to other insurers, we made the following observation regarding the statutory purpose of the association: \u201cThe association was established for the purpose of providing a limited form of protection for policyholders and claimants in the event of insurer insolvency. The protection it provides is limited based [on] its status as a nonprofit entity and the method by which it is funded. . . . [T]he association becomes obligated pursuant to \u00a7 38a-841, to the extent of covered claims within certain limits. . . . Because [General Statutes] \u00a7 38a-849 provides that insurers may pass on the costs of the assessments made against them by the association, it is in reality policyholders who pay for the protections afforded by the association. Limitations on the association\u2019s obligations, therefore, provide another form of protection against increased premiums for policyholders in addition to the primary protection afforded all claimants against losses resulting from insurer insolvency.\u201d (Citation omitted.) Id., 451. \u201cThe result is that policyholders, who in effect fund the association, pay only for protection for fellow policyholders and claimants in the event that an insurer becomes insolvent.\u201d Id., 452. This understanding of the statutory purpose was repeated in our decision in <em>Esposito </em>v. <em>Simkins Industries, Inc., </em>supra, 286 Conn. 329-31. Our review of the statutory purpose <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"641\">*641</page-number>of the association, as stated in our prior decisions, indicates that the legislature intended the association to serve the limited purpose of protecting Connecticut residents from insolvent insurers only to \u201cthe extent of covered claims within certain limits\u201d; <em>Hunnihan </em>v. <em>Mattatuck Mfg. Co., </em>supra, 451; while also providing protection against increased insurance premiums by limiting the extent of the association\u2019s liability. Our conclusion that \u00a7 38a-850 provides the association with immunity from sanctions imposed by the commissioner is consistent with this purpose. The association remains statutorily obligated to pay any and all \u201ccovered claims\u201d; General Statutes \u00a7 38a-841 (1); but is afforded immunity from monetary sanctions for its handling of those claims. Instead, as we discussed previously, the guaranty act provides for other mechanisms to ensure the association\u2019s compliance with its terms.</p>\n<p id=\"b661-5\">We also note that the cases on which the plaintiff relies, namely, <em>Connecticut Ins. Guaranty Assn. </em>v. <em>State, </em>supra, 278 Conn. 77, and <em>Casey </em>v. <em>Northeast Utilities, </em>supra, 249 Conn. 365, do not control our interpretation of the language of the immunity provision in \u00a7 38a-850. In <em>Connecticut Ins. Guaranty Assn., we </em>concluded that a claim that the state made as a self-insurer fell within the meaning of the term \u201ccovered claim,\u201d as defined in \u00a7 38a-838 (5). <em>Connecticut Ins. Guaranty Assn. </em>v. <em>State, </em>supra, 91. Because the claim was one that the association was obligated to pay as a \u201ccovered claim\u201d under \u00a7 38a-841 (1), the immunity provision in \u00a7 38a-850 was not implicated by the facts or relevant to our analysis in that case, and we did not address it. Our decision in <em>Casey </em>is not relevant to this case because it did not involve the association, the guaranty act, or the immunity provision of \u00a7 38a-850. See generally <em>Casey </em>v. <em>Northeast Utilities, </em>supra, 366-69. In <em>Casey, we </em>concluded that the second injury fund was hable for sanctions imposed by a workers\u2019 compensa<page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"642\">*642</page-number>tion commissioner for the mishandling of a claim. Id., 367, 383. <em>Casey </em>is distinguishable from this case, however, because the second injury fund is created and governed by the Workers\u2019 Compensation Act, and that act does not provide the second injury fund with immunity for its actions, unlike the guaranty act, which does provide such immunity for the association. We therefore conclude that the plain meaning of \u00a7 38a-850 vests the association with immunity from the sanctions imposed by the commissioner in the present case.</p>\n<p id=\"b662-5\">B</p>\n<p id=\"b662-6\">Because we have determined that the association is statutorily immune from the sanctions that the commissioner imposed, the association can be liable for those sanctions only if they fall within the meaning of the term \u201ccovered claim,\u201d as defined in \u00a7 38a-838 (5), which the association is required to pay under \u00a7 38a-841 (1). The defendant claims that the board improperly determined that the sanctions imposed in the present case fall within the meaning of the term \u201ccovered claim\u201d and that, because the sanctions fall outside of the plain meaning of the definition of \u201ccovered claim,\u201d the association is not obligated to pay the sanctions. The plaintiff argues that the board\u2019s decision was correct. We agree with the defendant.</p>\n<p id=\"b662-7\">In its decision, the board, relying on <em>Connecticut Ins. Guaranty Assn. </em>v. <em>Fontaine, </em>278 Conn. 779, 900 A.2d 18 (2006), initially determined that the intent of \u00a7\u00a7 38a-838 (5) and 38a-841 (1) is to make the association liable to the same extent that the insurer would have been if it had not been insolvent. The board then concluded that \u201c[tjhere is no dispute that had the original insurer unreasonably delayed payment or unreasonably contested liability . . . the . . . commissioner could have imposed statutory sanctions.\u201d The board further concluded that the sanctions imposed \u201cclearly [fell] within <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"643\">*643</page-number>the statutory definition of a \u2018covered claim\u2019 \u201d because the defendant \u201c[did] not identify any of the enumerated grounds in the statute [that] preclude the payment order [in the present case] . . . .\u201d We disagree.</p>\n<p id=\"b663-5\">We begin with the board\u2019s conclusion that the definition of \u201ccovered claim\u201d and our decision in <em>Fontaine </em>demonstrate that the association is hable to the same extent as the insolvent insurer would have been, including for sanctions. The relevant portion of General Statutes \u00a7 38a-838 (5) defines a \u201ccovered claim\u201d as \u201can unpaid claim, including, but not limited to, one for unearned premiums, <em>which arises out of and is within the coverage and subject to the applicable limits of an insurance policy . . . </em>issued by an insurer, if such insurer becomes an insolvent insurer . . . .\u201d (Emphasis added.) Thus, the language of the statute confines the extent of a covered claim to that \u201cwhich arises out of and is within\u201d the coverage of the underlying insurance policy. General Statutes \u00a7 38a-838 (5). The text of the definition thus excludes any liabilities beyond those that arise out of and are within the insolvent insurer\u2019s insurance policy. This reading is consistent with our decision in <em>Fontaine, </em>in which we noted that the association was obligated only \u201cto the same extent that the insolvent insurer would have been liable <em>under its policy.\" </em>(Emphasis added; internal quotation marks omitted.) <em>Connecticut Ins. Guaranty Assn. </em>v. <em>Fontaine, </em>supra, 278 Conn. 791. There is no evidence in the record that the insurance policy in the present case included an obligation on the part of the insurer to pay statutory penalties and attorney\u2019s fees in the event that it caused undue delay in the processing or payment of a claim. In the absence of such evidence, we conclude that the obligation to pay the sanctions does not arise out of the coverage of the policy but, rather, that such obligation arises out of the association\u2019s conduct in handling the claim. Thus, we conclude <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"644\">*644</page-number>that the definition of \u201ccovered claim\u201d limits the association\u2019s obligations to those found in the insolvent insurer\u2019s insurance policy and does not extend to liabilities arising from conduct in handling the claim if such a provision is not included in the policy.</p>\n<p id=\"b664-5\">The plaintiff nonetheless argues that the board properly determined that sanctions were part of a covered claim because sanctions are not among the enumerated exclusions listed in \u00a7 38a-838 (5) (i) through (v). We disagree. Simply because sanctions are not expressly <em>excluded </em>under the listed exclusions does not mean that sanctions necessarily must be <em>included </em>in the definition of the term \u201ccovered claim.\u201d The relevant inquiry is whether the sanctions are actually included in the definition because the association\u2019s obligation to pay a claim must be found in the guaranty act. See <em>Esposito </em>v. <em>Simkins Industries, Inc., </em>supra, 286 Conn. 338-39. If the obligation is not found in the guaranty act, it does not exist, and the association is obligated to decline payment. As we already have determined, the plain meaning of the definition of \u201ccovered claim\u201d set forth in \u00a7 38a-838 (5) does not include the sanctions imposed by the commissioner. It, therefore, is unnecessary to consider whether any of the exclusions to that definition apply.</p>\n<p id=\"b664-6\">The board also determined, and the plaintiff argues, that the workers\u2019 compensation commission may impose sanctions on the association in the same manner as it would on any insurer because General Statutes \u00a7 38a-841 (1) (b) provides that the association is \u201cdeemed the insurer to the extent of its obligations on the covered claims and to such extent shall have all rights, duties, and obligations of the insolvent insurer as if the insurer had not become insolvent . . . .\u201d The plaintiff asserts that this language demonstrates that the association is liable to the same extent as any insolvent insurer would be if that insurer had not become insol<page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"645\">*645</page-number>vent. The statute, however, deems the association to be the insurer only \u201cto the extent of its obligations on the covered claims . . . .\u201d General Statutes \u00a7 38a-841 (1) (b); see <em>Hunnihan </em>v. <em>Mattatuck Mfg. Co., </em>supra, 243 Conn. 449 (under \u00a7 38a-841 [1], \u201cthe association is authorized to pay only covered claims, and must deny all other claims\u201d). Thus, because we already have determined that the sanctions in the present case do not fall within the definition of \u201ccovered claim\u201d in \u00a7 38a-838 (5), the association is not \u201cdeemed the insurer\u201d for proposes of any sanctions imposed by the commissioner.</p>\n<p id=\"b665-5\">The dissent argues that the term \u201ccovered claim\u201d includes the sanctions imposed by the commissioner in the present case because sanctions should be covered under the terms of the underlying insurance policy. Specifically, the dissent concludes that \u201cinterest and attorney\u2019s fees assessed because of the unduly delayed payment of workers\u2019 compensation benefits arise out of the Workers\u2019 Compensation Act\u201d and that \u201c [t]he association is obligated to pay the full amount of any claim arising out of a workers\u2019 compensation policy, which is coextensive with the Workers\u2019 Compensation Act.\u201d To reach this conclusion, the dissent relies on General Statutes \u00a7 31-287,<footnotemark>27</footnotemark> which provides that a policy under the Workers\u2019 Compensation Act must cover \u201cthe entire liability of the <em>employer </em>thereunder . . . .\u201d (Emphasis added.) The dissent goes on to state that, \u201cunder the Workers\u2019 Compensation Act, workers\u2019 compensation <em>insurers </em>specifically are deemed responsible for assessments of interest and fees for undue delay.\u201d (Emphasis added.) The dissent concludes that, \u201c [therefore, policies issued by such insurers necessarily would cover assessments issued under \u00a7 31-300\u201d and that, \u201cunlike [with] other insurance policies, the legislature has mandated that workers\u2019 compensation policies be coexten<page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"646\">*646</page-number>sive with the Workers\u2019 Compensation Act.\u201d This conclusion, however, is flawed. General Statutes \u00a7 31-287 requires only that a workers\u2019 compensation policy cover \u201cthe entire liability of the <em>employer </em>thereunder . . . .\u201d (Emphasis added.) Nothing in the text of that provision requires a workers\u2019 compensation insurance policy to cover the liability of the <em>insurer </em>or that the policy be \u201ccoextensive\u201d with the entirety of the Workers\u2019 Compensation Act. Because the sanctions in the present case have been imposed against the association and not the plaintiffs <em>employer, </em>there is no basis to conclude that the insurance policy in the present case must have included coverage for the sanctions imposed. The association is not the employer; therefore, the fact that \u00a7 31-287 requires a workers\u2019 compensation insurance policy to cover the full liability of the employer is irrelevant. In the absence of any evidence that the sanctions imposed in this case were covered under the insolvent insurer\u2019s policy, we conclude that the sanctions are not part of a covered claim and that the association, therefore, is not obligated to pay them.<footnotemark>28</footnotemark></p>\n<p id=\"b667-4\"><page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"647\">*647</page-number>II</p>\n<p id=\"b667-5\">In addition to its statutory arguments, the defendant claims that the board improperly concluded that it was bound by the Appellate Court\u2019s decision in <em>Pantanella </em>v. <em>Enfield Ford, Inc., </em>supra, 65 Conn. App. 46, because <em>Pantanella </em>did not address the issue of whether the association is immune from sanctions or whether a sanction is part of a covered claim. In its decision, the board concluded that the facts of the present case were \u201cindistinguishable\u201d from those in <em>Pantanella </em>and, therefore, that it was required to follow it. Because the Appellate Court in <em>Pantanella </em>upheld an award of attorney\u2019s fees against the association under \u00a7 31-300; id., 53; the board concluded in the present case that <em>Pantanella </em>affirmed the \u201cpower [of workers\u2019 compensation commissioners] to levy statutory sanctions against [the association] . . . .\u201d The plaintiff argues that the board properly followed the Appellate Court\u2019s decision in <em>Pantanella. </em>We disagree with the plaintiff.</p>\n<p id=\"b667-6\"><em>In Pantanella, </em>the Appellate Court upheld the board\u2019s determination that the evidence in that case supported an award of attorney\u2019s fees, under \u00a7 31-300, against the <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"648\">*648</page-number>association for undue delay in the payment of benefits. <em>Pantanella </em>v. <em>Enfield Ford, Inc., </em>supra, 65 Conn. App. 53. The Appellate Court in <em>Pantanella, </em>however, did not address or resolve the issues raised in the present appeal because it did not address the provisions of the guaranty act. Specifically, the court did not address whether \u00a7 38a-850 provided the association with immunity from sanctions, such as an award of attorney\u2019s fees under \u00a7 31-300, and did not address whether sanctions were part of a \u201ccovered claim\u201d under \u00a7\u00a7 38a-841 (1) and 38a-838 (5). The court\u2019s discussion of the issue was limited to the following: \u201c[The association] first claims that the board improperly affirmed the commissioner\u2019s award of attorney\u2019s fees. We disagree.</p>\n<p id=\"b668-5\">\u201cThe commissioner found that on September 28, 1995, he had ordered that no further evidence would be admitted. [The association] ignored the commissioner\u2019s order by attempting, on a number of occasions, to introduce the transcript of the deposition of [a treating physician]. The commissioner also found that the litigation that resulted from [the association\u2019s] attempts to introduce the deposition caused undue delay in the payment of benefits to the plaintiff. On the basis of his findings, the commissioner awarded attorney\u2019s fees.</p>\n<p id=\"b668-6\">\u201cApplying \u00a7 31-300 to the facts as found by the commissioner, [the court] conclude [s] that the board properly affirmed the award of attorney\u2019s fees.\u201d Id.</p>\n<p id=\"b668-7\">This brief discussion by the Appellate Court focuses entirely on whether an award of attorney\u2019s fees under \u00a7 31-300 of the Workers\u2019 Compensation Act was warranted by the evidence. The court did not address the guaranty act or whether the immunity provision in \u00a7 38a-850 would provide the association with immunity from such an award or whether an award of attorney\u2019s fees is part of a \u201ccovered claim,\u201d as that term is defined in \u00a7 38a-838 (5). Indeed, the lack of any mention of <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"649\">*649</page-number>these issues in <em>Pantanella </em>indicates that these arguments were not even raised before the Appellate Court.<footnotemark>29</footnotemark> Because the Appellate Court in <em>Pantanella </em>did not actually address the issues in the present case, the board should not have relied on <em>Pantanella </em>as being dispositive of the issues before it. See, e.g., <em>State </em>v. <em>Ouellette, </em>190 Conn. 84, 91, 459 A.2d 1005 (1983) (\u201c[i]t is a general rule that a case resolves only those issues explicitly decided in the case\u201d); <em>Connecticut Light &amp; Power Co. </em>v. <em>Costle, </em>179 Conn. 415, 416 n.1, 426 A.2d 1324 (1980) (same).</p>\n<p id=\"b669-5\">Additionally, the board\u2019s decision appears to conflate our past discussions of stare decisis, a doctrine pursuant to which a court follows <em>its own </em>prior decisions, with the concept of binding precedent, pursuant to which an inferior court follows the decisions of a higher court. Although we note that the terms \u201cstare decisis\u201d and \u201cprecedent\u201d are often used interchangeably; see F. Schauer, \u201cPrecedent,\u201d 39 Stan. L. Rev. 571, 576 n.11 (1987) (noting that \u201ccontemporary usage has collapsed much of the difference between precedent and stare decisis\u201d); it is important that the concepts represented by the terms remain distinct because they involve different considerations.<footnotemark>30</footnotemark> The purpose of the doctrine of stare decisis is to provide continuity in our decision making. \u201cThis court has repeatedly acknowledged the significance of stare decisis to our system of jurispru<page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"650\">*650</page-number>dence because it gives stability and continuity to orn-ease law.\u201d <em>Conway </em>v. <em>Wilton, </em>238 Conn. 653, 658, 680 A.2d 242 (1996). We, therefore, will respect our prior decisions unless strong considerations to the contrary require us to reexamine them. See id. (\u201c[s]tare decisis is a formidable obstacle to any court seeking to change its own law\u201d [internal quotation marks omitted]). For example, we may overturn a prior holding if we find it to be \u201cclearly wrong\u201d; (internal quotation marks omitted) id., 660; or when \u201cthe most cogent reasons and inescapable logic\u201d require us to do so. <em>Herald Publishing Co. </em>v. <em>Bill, </em>142 Conn. 53, 62, 111 A.2d 4 (1955).</p>\n<p id=\"b670-5\">Although the doctrine of stare decisis permits a court to overturn <em>its own </em>prior cases in limited circumstances, the concept of binding precedent prohibits a trial court from overturning a prior decision of an appellate court. This prohibition is necessary to accomplish the purpose of a hierarchical judicial system. A trial court is required to follow the prior decisions of an appellate court to the extent that they are applicable to facts and issues in the case before it, and the trial court may not overturn or disregard binding precedent. See, e.g., <em>Stuart </em>v. <em>Stuart, </em>297 Conn. 26, 45-46, 996 A.2d 259 (2010) (\u201cit is manifest to our hierarchical judicial system that this court has the final say on matters of Connecticut law and that the Appellate Court and Superior Court are bound by our precedent\u201d); <em>Jolly, Inc. </em>v. <em>Zoning Board of Appeals, </em>237 Conn. 184, 195, 676 A.2d 831 (1996) (\u201cIt is axiomatic that a trial court is bound by Supreme Court precedent. . . . This principle is inherent in a hierarchical judicial system. . . . [Revision of Supreme Court precedent is not the trial court\u2019s function.\u201d [Citations omitted.]).</p>\n<p id=\"b670-6\">In the present case, it appears that the board misunderstood this distinction. In its decision, the board stressed \u201cthe importance of stare decisis\u201d in following <em>Pantanella </em>and indicated that it could decide not to <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"651\">*651</page-number>follow it only if \u201cinescapable logic\u201d so required. (Internal quotation marks omitted.) In reaching its determination, the board relied in part on our decision in <em>Herald Publishing Co., </em>in which we observed that \u201ca court should not overrule its earlier decisions unless the most cogent reasons and inescapable logic require it.\u201d <em>Herald Publishing Co. </em>v. <em>Bill, </em>supra, 142 Conn. 62. The board\u2019s reliance on this case was mistaken because the court\u2019s discussion in <em>Herald Publishing Co. </em>referred to the doctrine of stare decisis and discussed a standard for determining when a court might overrule <em>its own </em>prior decisions. The board, however, was not determining whether to overrule one of its own decisions; rather, it was determining whether to follow a prior decision of the Appellate Court. Because the board does not have the authority either to overrule or to decline to follow a decision of the Appellate Court, the board improperly addressed the issue of whether \u201cinescapable logic\u201d required it to disregard the Appellate Court\u2019s decision in <em>Pantanella. </em>The only decision for the board to make regarding <em>Pantanella </em>was whether it was binding precedent that controlled the board\u2019s resolution of the issues before it. As we already have discussed, the Appellate Court\u2019s decision in <em>Pantanella </em>did not address the issues raised in the present appeal, and, therefore, the board improperly concluded that it was bound by that decision.</p>\n<p id=\"b671-5\">The plaintiff argues, however, that \u201c[i]t is irrelevant that the Appellate Court did not expressly address [in <em>Pantanella] </em>the issue of whether [the association] is statutorily immune [from] the imposition of penalties . . . .\u201d The plaintiff argues that, instead, \u201cwhat is relevant is that the Appellate Court affirmed an award of attorney\u2019s fees against [the association] thus confirming . . . [that the association] is not immune from them.\u201d For this reason, the plaintiff argues, <em>Pantanella </em>controls on the issue of whether a workers\u2019 compensation com<page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"652\">*652</page-number>missioner may impose sanctions against the association, the board was bound to follow it, and <em>Pantanella </em>should not be overruled unless it is clearly wrong. In support of his argument, the plaintiff cites to our decision in <em>Conway </em>v. <em>Wilton, </em>supra, 238 Conn. 653, in which this court recognized an exception to stare decisis when the court determines that a prior decision is \u201cclearly wrong.\u201d (Internal quotation marks omitted.) Id., 660.</p>\n<p id=\"b672-5\">The plaintiffs arguments are without merit. First, the plaintiffs assertion that <em>Pantanella </em>confirms that the association is not immune from sanctions, despite the lack of discussion regarding immunity in that case, ignores our prior cases that demonstrate that a case resolves only the issues explicitly decided by the court. See, e.g., <em>State </em>v. <em>Ouellette, </em>supra, 190 Conn. 91. The plaintiff concedes that the Appellate Court did not address the issue of immunity in <em>Pantanella. </em>As we discussed previously, <em>Pantanella </em>is inapposite because it does not address the specific issues raised in this appeal. The board thus incorrectly concluded that it was bound by <em>Pantanella.</em></p>\n<p id=\"b672-6\">Second, even if the Appellate Court\u2019s decision in <em>Pan-tanella </em>was relevant to the present case, the plaintiff incorrectly contends that we first would need to determine that the decision is \u201cclearly wrong.\u201d (Internal quotation marks omitted.) <em>Conway </em>v. <em>Wilton, </em>supra, 238 Conn. 660. We look to whether a decision is clearly wrong as a guiding principle only when considering whether to overturn a prior holding of this court. Decisions of the Appellate Court are not binding on this court, and we are not required to determine in the first instance that the decision is clearly wrong before overturning a decision of the Appellate Court. See, e.g., <em>State </em>v. <em>Samuels, </em>273 Conn. 541, 553 n.8, 871 A.2d 1005 (2005) (\u201c[this court is] not bound by a decision of the Appellate Court\u201d).</p>\n<p id=\"b673-4\"><page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"653\">*653</page-number>The plaintiff also asserts that \u201c[t]his court affirmed the Appellate Court\u2019s decision\u201d in <em>Pantanella. </em>The plaintiff is mistaken. This court denied the petition for certification to appeal from the Appellate Court\u2019s decision. See <em>Pantanella </em>v. <em>Enfield Ford, Inc., </em>258 Conn. 930, 783 A.2d 1029 (2001) (\u201c[t]he petition by the [association] for certification for appeal from the Appellate Court ... is denied\u201d [citation omitted]). We have made it clear that a denial of a petition for certification to appeal does not signify that this court approves of or affirms the decision or judgment of the Appellate Court. See, e.g., <em>Grieco </em>v. <em>Zoning Commission, </em>226 Conn. 230, 233 n.5, 627 A.2d 432 (1993) (\u201cThe exercise of discretionary jurisdiction, by way of certification, is premised on the understanding that a denial of discretionary review leaves the underlying judgment in place without an endorsement of its merits. [A] denial of certification does not necessarily indicate our approval either of the result reached ... or of the opinion rendered . . . .\u201d [Internal quotation marks omitted.]). Therefore, even if the Appellate Court\u2019s decision in <em>Pan-tanella </em>was relevant to the issues in this appeal, it would still be unnecessary to consider whether the decision was clearly wrong because it is not a decision of this court.</p>\n<p id=\"b673-5\">In sum, we conclude that \u00a7 38a-850 provides the association with immunity from the statutory sanctions that the commissioner imposed and that such sanctions are not included in the definition of \u201ccovered claim\u201d in \u00a7 38a-838 (5). The Appellate Court\u2019s decision in <em>Pantanella </em>does not affect our conclusion. Accordingly, the association is not subject to the sanctions that the commissioner imposed in the present case.<footnotemark>31</footnotemark></p>\n<p id=\"b674-4\"><page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"654\">*654</page-number>The decision of the board is reversed and the case is remanded to the board with direction to reverse the commissioner\u2019s decision to impose sanctions and to award attorney\u2019s fees.</p>\n<p id=\"b674-5\">In this opinion ROGERS, C.

Specifically, the plaintiff relies on article first, \u00a7 10, of the constitution of Connecticut, which provides: \u201cAll courts shall be open, and every person, for an injury done to him in his person, property or reputation, shall have remedy by due course of law, and right and justice administered without sale, denial or delay.\u201d The plaintiff asserts that, if the <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"625\">*625</page-number>association is not required to pay the sanctions in the present case, he will be left without a remedy in violation of his rights under article first, \u00a7 10. The plaintiffs brief discussion of this claim is limited to the text of the constitutional provision, one citation to a case of limited relevance, and a limited, conclusory analysis. Additionally, the plaintiff did not provide any analysis of the factors set forth in this court\u2019s decision in <em>State </em>v. <em>Geisler, </em>222 Conn. 672, 684-85, 610 A.2d 1225 (1992). We conclude that the plaintiff did not provide an adequate analysis of his constitutional claim, and, therefore, we decline to review it. See, e.g., <em>Connecticut Light &amp; Power Co. </em>v. <em>Dept. of Public Utility Control, </em>266 Conn. 108, 120-21, 830 A.2d 1121 (2003) (upholding trial court\u2019s decision not to address constitutional claim when party provided only text of provision and two citations not specifically relating to issue before court). Even if we were to address this claim, we note that the plaintiffs argument would be unlikely to succeed. As we discuss in part IA 2 of this opinion, the plaintiff is afforded a remedy, it is just not the remedy that he seeks. Additionally, to the extent that the plaintiff asserts a constitutional right to attorney\u2019s fees, it is doubtful that article first, \u00a7 10, provides such a right. See <em>Doe </em>v. <em>State, </em>216 Conn. 85, 106, 579 A.2d 37 (1990) (concluding that article first, \u00a7 10, provides no independent right to attorney\u2019s fees).</p>\n</footnote>\n<footnote label=\"11\">\n<p id=\"b645-7\"> The defendant assumed the handling of the claim involved in the present case on behalf of the association pursuant to the provisions of the guaranty act when the workers\u2019 compensation insurer of the plaintiffs employer became insolvent.</p>\n</footnote>\n<footnote label=\"12\">\n<p id=\"b647-6\"> The board also found that the co-pay \u201cremains unpaid.\u201d The defendant notes, however, that the $100 co-pay was \u201cpaid\u201d on September 26, 2006. The plaintiff concedes that there is \u201csome evidence\u201d that the $100 co-pay was paid but that \u201cthe record is not clear as to when it was paid.\u201d Nevertheless, a determination of whether and when the $100 co-pay was paid is not necessary for the resolution of this appeal.</p>\n</footnote>\n<footnote label=\"13\">\n<p id=\"b648-6\"> Although the commissioner appeared to Impose the sanctions directly against the defendant rather than the association, the board deemed the association as the entity against which sanctions were imposed. Because the association ultimately was responsible for processing the plaintiff\u2019s claim under the guaranty act and the defendant merely was processing that claim on the association\u2019s behalf; see footnote 11 of this opinion; the board correctly deemed the association as the entity against which the sanctions were imposed.</p>\n</footnote>\n<footnote label=\"14\">\n<p id=\"b649-9\"> We assume that the board was using the term \u201ctribunal\u201d to refer to the institution of the workers\u2019 compensation commissioner.</p>\n</footnote>\n<footnote label=\"15\">\n<p id=\"b649-10\"> Although the board concluded that the commissioner had common-law authority to impose sanctions, the plaintiff did not defend this conclusion in his arguments before this court.

The dissent first concludes that these exceptions demonstrate that \u201crecovery for claims against insolvent workers\u2019 compensation insurers is more liberal than recovery available for claims against all other types of insurers.\u201d Nevertheless, even if the guaranty act does treat workers\u2019 compensation policies differently, in some circumstances, from automobile or life insurance policies, this fact is irrelevant to our analysis of the statutes in the present case because the statutes at issue do not distinguish between the type of insurance that the association is covering. The dissent also concludes that these four limited exceptions demonstrate that \u201cthe guaranty act specifically dictates that terms of recovery for workers\u2019 compensation claims shall be derived from the Workers\u2019 Compensation Act.\u201d The dissent reads too much out of these limited exceptions and reaches conclusions that are not supported by the text of the guaranty act. Under the dissent\u2019s broad reading, the exceptions would become the general rule. Indeed, the fact that the legislature provided certain specific exceptions for workers\u2019 compensation cases demonstrates <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"647\">*647</page-number>that, when the legislature intends to treat workers\u2019 compensation cases differently, it does so with a specific exception. See, e.g., <em>Windels </em>v. <em>Environmental Protection Commission, </em>284 Conn. 268, 299, 933 A.2d 256 (2007) (legislature knows how to convey its intent expressly). The legislature did not provide any exception for sanctions under the Workers\u2019 Compensation Act in the immunity granted to the association under \u00a7 38a-850, and the legislature provided no separate definition for \u201ccovered claims\u201d arising out of a workers\u2019 compensation policy. It would be improper for this court to supply an exception that the legislature has not provided for in the statute. See, e.g., <em>Bloomfield </em>v. <em>United Electrical, Radio &amp; Machine Workers of America, Connecticut Independent Police Union, Local 14, </em>285 Conn. 278, 289, 939 A.2d 561 (2008) (\u201c[I]t is a principle of statutory construction that a court must construe a statute as written. . . .

Recently, in <em>Property &amp; Casualty Ins. Guaranty Corp. </em>v. <em>Yanni, </em>397 Md. 474, 919 A.2d 1 (2007), the plain meaning of certain Maryland statutory provisions that provide immunity similar to <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"654\">*654</page-number>that provided in \u00a7 38a-850 led the Maryland Court of Appeals to conclude that Maryland\u2019s property and casualty insurance guaranty corporation was immune from sanctions imposed by the Maryland workers\u2019 compensation commission; id., 478, 494; and that those sanctions were not part of a \u201ccovered claim\u201d within the meaning of the statutory scheme. (Internal quotation marks omitted.) Id., 478, 490. The courts of other states also have reached the same conclusion. See, e.g., <em>Mosley </em>v. <em>Industrial Claim Appeals Office, </em>119 P.3d 576, 579 (Colo. App. 2005), cert. denied sub nom. <em>Mosley </em>v. <em>Colorado Ins. Guaranty Assn., </em>Docket No. 05SC343, 2005 Colo. LEXIS 736 (Colo. August 22, 2005); <em>Caufield </em>v. <em>Leonard, </em>676 So. 2d 1117, 1119-20 (La.

The only state that has not come to the same conclusion is Rhode Island. See <em>Callaghan </em>v. <em>Rhode Island Occupational Information Coordinating Committee/Industry Educational Council of Labor, </em>704 A.2d 740 (R.I.1997). The court in <em>Callaghan </em>held that the Rhode Island insurers insolvency fund was not immune from sanctions by the Rhode Island workers\u2019 compensation court and that such sanctions are part of a covered claim. Id., 745-47. In so holding, the court found the language of the liability provision to be broad but nevertheless restricted its meaning. See id., 746-47. Courts analyzing the <em>Callaghan </em>decision have rejected its approach as \u201cnot persuasive because it represents the solitary minority view and is contrary to the purposes of the [guaranty statutes].\u201d <em>Mosley </em>v. <em>Industrial Claim Appeals Office, </em>supra, 580; see also <em>Property &amp; Casualty Ins.

The majority concludes that, if an assessment of interest and attorney\u2019s fees for an undue delay of payment of workers\u2019 compensation benefits falls within the meaning of a \u201c \u2018[c]overed claim\u2019 \u201d under the Connecticut Insurance Guaranty Association Act (guaranty act), General Statutes, \u00a7\u00a7 38a-836 through <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"655\">*655</page-number>38a-853, the immunity provision of that act, General Statutes \u00a7 SSa-850,<footnotemark>1</footnotemark> cannot bar payment of such a claim. It further concludes, however, that the assessment at issue in the present case is not a covered claim. I disagree. Specifically, the guaranty act recognizes the distinct nature of a workers\u2019 compensation policy, due to the mandates of the Workers\u2019 Compensation Act, General Statutes \u00a7 31-275 et seq., and thereby deems such an assessment a covered claim under the guaranty act. Indeed, the text of the guaranty act and the history of the treatment of claims against insolvent insurers under the Workers\u2019 Compensation Act, demonstrate a clear legislative intent to afford greater recovery for workers\u2019 compensation claims than for other claims that fall under the guaranty act. Because I conclude that an assessment of interest and attorney\u2019s fees under the Workers\u2019 Compensation Act is a covered claim under the guaranty act, I disagree with the majority that \u00a7 38a-850 shields the Connecticut Insurance Guaranty Association (association) from the assessment by the workers\u2019 compensation commissioner for the third district (commissioner) of interest and attorney\u2019s fees for the association\u2019s undue delay in paying workers\u2019 compensation benefits owed to the plaintiff, James Potvin.</p>\n<p id=\"b675-5\">In order to provide context to the meaning of a covered claim as applied to a workers\u2019 compensation policy, I begin with the clear evidence in the guaranty act that claims against insolvent workers\u2019 compensation insurers are treated differently than claims against other insurers. The guaranty act divides the source of recovery for claims against insolvent insurers into three sepa<page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"656\">*656</page-number>rate accounts, one of which is dedicated solely to workers\u2019 compensation insurance. General Statutes \u00a7 38a-839 (\u201c[f]or the purposes of administration and assessment, [the] association shall be divided into three separate accounts: [a] [t]he workers\u2019 compensation insurance account; [b] the automobile insurance account; and [c] an account for all other insurance to which sections 38a-836 to 38a-853, inclusive, apply\u201d). Although every other claim covered by the guaranty act must be filed within two years of an insurer\u2019s declaration of insolvency, workers\u2019 compensation claims are controlled by the limitations period set forth under the Workers\u2019 Compensation Act, which can extend considerably longer. See General Statutes \u00a7 38a-841 (1) (a) (ii) (B) (requiring that association \u201cbe obligated for any claim filed with the association after the expiration of two years from the date of the declaration of insolvency unless such claim arose out of a workers\u2019 compensation policy and was timely filed in accordance with [General Statutes \u00a7] 31-294c [of the Workers\u2019 Compensation Act]\u201d); see, e.g., <em>Ricigliano </em>v. <em>Ideal Forging Corp., </em>280 Conn. 723, 727, 912 A.2d 462 (2006) (claim filed six years after claimant was diagnosed with multiple myeloma deemed timely under Workers\u2019 Compensation Act because it was filed within three years of claimant\u2019s knowledge of causal connection between disease and employment). In setting forth the scope and limitations of a covered claim, which is defined as \u201can unpaid claim . . . [that] arises out of and is within the coverage and subject to the applicable limits of an insurance policy to which sections 38a-836 to 38a-853, inclusive, apply\u201d; General Statutes \u00a7 38a-838 (5); the guaranty act sets a cap on payments of all such covered claims, except that the association \u201cshall pay the <em>full amount </em>of any such claim <em>arising out of a workers\u2019 compensation policy </em>. . . .\u201d (Emphasis added.) General Statutes \u00a7 38a-841 (1) (a) (ii).</p>\n<p id=\"b677-4\"><page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"657\">*657</page-number>These provisions demonstrate two principles. First, recovery for claims against insolvent workers\u2019 compensation insurers is more liberal than recovery available for claims against all other types of insurers. See also General Statutes \u00a7 38a-838 (5) (B) (iii) (exempting workers\u2019 compensation claimants from exclusion under definition of \u201c \u2018[c]overed claim\u2019 \u201d for nonresidents filing claim against insurers having above specified net worth). Second and more significantly, whereas the terms and limits of compensation for other claims are derived from the guaranty act, the guaranty act specifically dictates that terms of recovery for workers\u2019 compensation claims shall be derived from the Workers\u2019 Compensation Act. This distinction is of paramount significance when divining whether the assessment at issue falls within the scope of a covered claim. Because a covered workers\u2019 compensation claim must extend to \u201cthe full amount of any such [covered] claim arising out of a workers\u2019 compensation policy\u201d; General Statutes \u00a7 38a-841 (1) (a) (ii); the question is whether an assessment of interest and attorney\u2019s fees under General Statutes \u00a7 31-300 arises out of a workers\u2019 compensation policy. That question must be answered in the affirmative.</p>\n<p id=\"b677-5\">The Workers\u2019 Compensation Act clearly mandates that \u201c[n]o policy of insurance against liability under [the Workers\u2019 Compensation Act] . . . shall be made unless the same covers the <em>entire liability </em>of the employer thereunder . . . .\u201d<footnotemark>2</footnotemark> (Emphasis added.) General Statutes \u00a7 31-287. As a general matter, I agree with <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"658\">*658</page-number>the majority that the term liability is an expansive one that generally would encompass an assessment of interest or attorney\u2019s fees. See Black\u2019s Law Dictionary (6th Ed. 1990) (Defining \u201c[liability\u201d as follows: \u201cThe word is a broad legal term. ... It has been referred to as of the most comprehensive significance, including almost every character of hazard or responsibility, absolute, contingent or likely. It has been defined to mean: all character of debts and obligations . . . .\u201d [Citation omitted.]). Moreover, under the Workers\u2019 Compensation Act, workers\u2019 compensation insurers specifically are deemed responsible for assessments of interest and fees for undue delay. See General Statutes \u00a7 31-300 (permitting such assessments \u201c[i]n cases where, through the fault or neglect of the employer <em>or insurer, </em>adjustments of compensation have been unduly delayed, or where through such fault or neglect, payments have been unduly delayed\u201d [emphasis added]). Indeed, such assessments are \u201cinclude [d] in the [commissioner\u2019s] award . . . .\u201d General Statutes \u00a7 31-300. Therefore, policies issued by such insurers necessarily would cover assessments issued under \u00a7 31-300. See, e.g., <em>Imbrogno </em>v. <em>Stamford Hospital, </em>28 Conn. App. 113, 125-26, 612 A.2d 82 (remanding case for further award of interest pursuant to \u00a7 31-300 on medical bills for which commissioner found payment by defendant employer and defendant insurer unduly delayed), cert. denied, 223 Conn. 920, 615 A.2d 507 (1992). Thus, unlike other insurance policies, the legislature had mandated that workers\u2019 compensation policies be coextensive with the Workers\u2019 Compensation Act.</p>\n<p id=\"b678-5\">Indeed, in a 1993 decision, the workers\u2019 compensation review board (board) rejected the precise arguments advanced by the association in the present case in light of the aforementioned provisions and the particular nature of claims arising out of a workers\u2019 compensation policy. See <em>Versage </em>v. <em>Kurt Volk, Inc., </em>11 Conn. <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"659\">*659</page-number>Workers\u2019 Comp. Rev. Op. 253 (1993). The association had claimed in that case that the guaranty act precluded an award of interest under the Workers\u2019 Compensation Act for delayed payment because the interest was not a covered claim and was barred by the immunity provision. Id., 258. In rejecting the first contention, the board persuasively explained: \u201cThe [g]uaranty [a]ct\u2019s definition of a \u2018covered claim\u2019 is important to understanding the obligations of [the association] under the [guaranty] [a]ct. For purposes of this case, a \u2018covered claim\u2019 is \u2018an unpaid claim . . . which arises out of and is within the coverage and subject to the applicable limits of an insurance policy . . . issued by an [insolvent] insurer. . . .\u2019 General Statutes [\u00a7] 38a-838 (6). [The association] argues that the commissioner\u2019s award of interest does not arise out of or within the coverage of the workers\u2019 compensation insurance policy between the respondent-employer and the insolvent insurer. Instead, the interest award, according to [the association], arose by way of the workers\u2019 compensation statute. We reject this narrow reading of the [g]uaranty [a]ct.</p>\n<p id=\"b679-5\">\u201cThe [g]uaranty [a]ct\u2019s definition of \u2018covered claim\u2019 must be understood in the context of the statutes governing the underlying insurance policies [which] it protects. See <em>Connecticut Insurance Guaranty Association </em>v. <em>Union Carbide Corporation, </em>217 Conn. 371, 378-79 [585 A.2d 1216] (1991). With regard to workers\u2019 compensation insurance policies, we must examine the requirements of General Statutes [\u00a7] 31-287. \u2018No policy of insurance against liability under [the Workers\u2019 Compensation Act] . . . shall be made unless the same covers the entire liability of the employer thereunder. . . .\u2019 General Statutes \u00a7 31-287. In light of this requirement that workers\u2019 compensation insurance cover an employer\u2019s <em>entire liability </em>under the [Workers\u2019 Compensation Act], <em>there can be no distinction between a compensation award which arises out of a workers\u2019 </em><page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"660\">*660</page-number><em>compensation policy and one that arises out of the workers\u2019 compensation statute. </em>See <em>Plainville </em>v. <em>Travelers Indemnity Co., </em>178 Conn. 664, 674 [425 A.2d 131] (1979). By virtue of [\u00a7] 31-287, <em>they are necessarily one and the same.\u201d</em><footnotemark><em>3</em></footnotemark><em> </em>(Emphasis altered.) <em>Versage </em>v. <em>Kurt Volk, Inc., </em>supra, 11 Conn. Workers\u2019 Comp. Rev. Op. 258.</p>\n<p id=\"b680-5\">In rejecting the association\u2019s immunity argument in <em>Versage, </em>the board also examined the limited case law from other jurisdictions and reasoned that the guaranty act\u2019s immunity provision is intended to bar tort actions or statutory actions for interest and fees for untimely payment of claims, but not claims arising under a workers\u2019 compensation policy itself.<footnotemark>4</footnotemark> Id., 260. The board noted that a contrary interpretation would thwart the legislative policies underlying the Workers\u2019 Compensation Act. Id., 261. It therefore reasoned that \u201cthe \u2018covered claim\u2019 and immunity provisions must be read together.\u201d Id., 260. In other words, the board determined that a covered claim is not barred by the immunity provision. The assessment of interest for delayed payment of a workers\u2019 compensation claim, therefore, differs from statutory or common-law penalties for <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"661\">*661</page-number>delayed payment of other types of claims because the former is covered under, and arises out of, the policy itself, which, by law, is coextensive with liability under the Workers\u2019 Compensation Act, not some source external to the policy. See <em>Plainville </em>v. <em>Travelers Indemnity Co., </em>supra, 178 Conn. 674.</p>\n<p id=\"b681-5\">The rationale for allowing the commissioner to assess interest and attorney\u2019s fees against the association for its unduly delayed payment of workers\u2019 compensation benefits while the association may not be liable for its delayed payment of other types of insurance benefits may be explained not only by the statutory mandates of the Workers\u2019 Compensation Act but also by the history of the treatment of claims against insolvent workers\u2019 compensation insurers. For twelve years preceding the enactment of the guaranty act in 1971; see Public Acts 1971, No. 466; the Workers\u2019 Compensation Act provided a mechanism, through the second injury fund, to allow workers to recover for awards made against insolvent workers\u2019 compensation insurers. See Public Acts 1959, No. 580, \u00a7\u00a7 12, 13 (renaming second injury fund \u201cthe second injury and compensation assurance fund\u201d and making fund responsible for covering workers\u2019 compensation awards against insolvent insurers).<footnotemark>5</footnotemark> The subsequent enactment of the guaranty act created a similar mechanism for claims against other types of insolvent insurers. Although the guaranty act included workers\u2019 compensation insurers, because that coverage was duplicative of the coverage provided under the Workers\u2019 Compensation Act, for the first fifteen years <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"662\">*662</page-number>after the enactment of the guaranty act, the second injury fund continued to pay claims against insolvent workers\u2019 compensation insurers. Responsibility for such claims finally was transferred to the association through a 1986 amendment to the Workers\u2019 Compensation Act. See Public Acts 1986, No. 86-35, \u00a7 1 (b);<footnotemark>6</footnotemark> see also 29 H.R. Proc., Pt. 3, 1986 Sess., p. 845, remarks of Representative Francis X. O\u2019Neill, Jr.<footnotemark>7</footnotemark> Thus, differential treatment of workers\u2019 compensation claims under the guaranty act arises from the differences in both the legislative mandate and the historical treatment of such claims.</p>\n<p id=\"b682-5\">In sum, interest and attorney\u2019s fees assessed because of the unduly delayed payment of workers\u2019 compensation benefits arise out of the Workers\u2019 Compensation Act. The association is obligated to pay the full amount of any claim arising out of a workers\u2019 compensation policy, which is coextensive with the Workers\u2019 Compensation Act. The majority rejects this conclusion, however, by reasoning that, because the Workers\u2019 Compensation Act mandates that the policy cover the full extent of the <em>employer's </em>liability, but does not expressly impose that mandate with respect to the <em>insurer's </em>liability, and because the association is assuming the insurer\u2019s liability, the association cannot be deemed responsible to the full extent of liability <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"663\">*663</page-number>under the Workers\u2019 Compensation Act. This logic contravenes both the Workers\u2019 Compensation Act and basic principles of insurance law. Section 31-287 of the Workers\u2019 Compensation Act makes clear that the insurer steps in the shoes of the employer and is directly obligated to the employee to the same extent as the employer. That section provides in relevant part: \u201cNo policy of insurance against liability under this chapter, except as provided in section 31-284, shall be made unless the same covers the entire liability of the employer thereunder <em>and contains an agreement by the insurer that, as between the employee and the insurer, </em>notice or knowledge of the occurrence of injury by the insured shall be deemed notice or knowledge by the insurer, that jurisdiction of the insured for the purposes of this chapter shall be jurisdiction of the insurer and <em>the insurer shall in all things be bound by and subject to the findings, awards and judgments rendered against such insured; and also that, if the insured becomes insolvent or is discharged in bankruptcy during the period that the policy is in operation ... an injured employee or other person entitled to compensation under the provisions of this chapter may enforce his claim to compensation against the insurer to the same extent that the insured could have enforced his claim against such insurer had he paid compensa</em>tion.\u201d (Emphasis added.) General Statutes \u00a7 31-287. This identity of interest between the insurer and the insured employer under the policy in relation to the employee is a bedrock principle of workers\u2019 compensation. See, e.g., General Statutes \u00a7 31-279 (c) (1) (\u201c[a]ny employer or any insurer acting on behalf of an employer, may establish a plan, subject to the approval of the chairman of the Workers\u2019 Compensation Commission under subsection [d] of this section, for the provision of medical care that the employer provides for treatment of any injury or illness under this chapter\u201d); <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"664\">*664</page-number>General Statutes \u00a7 31-288 (b) (1) (\u201c[w]henever through the fault or neglect of an employer or insurer, the adjustment or payment of compensation due under this chapter is unduly delayed, such employer or insurer may be assessed by the commissioner hearing the claim a civil penalty of not more than one thousand dollars for each such case of delay, to be paid to the claimant\u201d); General Statutes \u00a7 31-294d (a) (1) (\u201c[tjhe employer, any insurer acting on behalf of the employer, or any other entity acting on behalf of the employer or insurer shall be responsible for paying the cost of such prescription drugs [for an injured employee] directly to the provider\u201d); General Statutes \u00a7 31-299b (\u201c[i]f an employee suffers an injury or disease for which compensation is found by the commissioner to be payable according to the provisions of this chapter, the employer who last employed the claimant prior to the filing of the claim, or the employer\u2019s insurer, shall be initially liable for the payment of such compensation\u201d). Indeed, where an employer chooses to self-insure rather than obtain coverage through a private insurance carrier; see General Statutes \u00a7 31-345; the insured and the insurer are, in fact, one in the same.</p>\n<p id=\"b684-5\">Moreover, as a general matter, if one were to extend the majority\u2019s logic to other insurance policies covered by the guaranty act, there would be no covered claims for which the association would be liable because no insurance policy treats the insurer as the insured (in the present case, the employer). By issuing a policy, an insurer becomes liable to the full extent to which it obligates itself under the policy. The difference between other types of insurers and workers\u2019 compensation insurers, of course, is that the former are not obligated by law to cover penalties for the unduly delayed payment of benefits. Therefore, I would affirm the decision of the board in the present case ordering the association to pay the assessment of interest and attorney\u2019s fees.</p>\n<p id=\"b684-6\">Accordingly, I respectfully dissent.</p>\n<footnote label=\"1\">\n<p id=\"b675-6\"> General Statutes \u00a7 38a-850 provides: \u201cThere shall be no liability on the part of and no cause of action of any nature shall arise against any member insurer, said association or its agents or employees, the board of directors, or any person serving as an alternate or substitute representative of any director or the commissioner or his representatives for any action taken or any failure to act by them in the performance of their powers and duties under sections 38a-836 to 38a-853, Inclusive.\u201d</p>\n</footnote>\n<footnote label=\"2\">\n<p id=\"b677-6\"> Therefore, the majority\u2019s statement that \u201c[tjhere is no evidence in the record that the insurance policy in the present case included an obligation on the part of the insurer to pay statutory penalties and attorney\u2019s fees in the event that it caused undue delay in the processing or payment of a claim,\u201d presupposes that workers\u2019 compensation insurers are issuing policies in violation of a legislative mandate. I assume, in the absence of evidence to the contrary, that workers\u2019 compensation insurers will not act contrary to their legal obligations.</p>\n</footnote>\n<footnote label=\"3\">\n<p id=\"b680-6\"> Perhaps because <em>Versage </em>is not of recent vintage, the board in the present case overlooked this precedent. There is no indication in the board\u2019s subsequent opinions that it has disavowed this reasoning and, indeed, there would be no basis to do so.</p>\n</footnote>\n<footnote label=\"4\">\n<p id=\"b680-7\"> I note that there is little case law from other jurisdictions specifically addressing whether an assessment of interest and/or attorney\u2019s fees under a workers\u2019 compensation scheme is barred by immunity provisions of a guaranty act. There is a split of authority among those jurisdictions. Compare <em>Callaghan </em>v. <em>Rhode Island Occupational Information Coordinating Committee/Industry Educational Council of Labor, </em>704 A.2d 740, 747 (R.I.1997) (unanimous court concluding that immunity provision does not apply) with <em>Mosley </em>v. <em>Industrial Claim Appeals Office, </em>119 P.3d 576, 579 (Colo.
