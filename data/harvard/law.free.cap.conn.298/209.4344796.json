Ct. 417, 136 L. Ed. 2d 347 (1996), we agree with the state that, under the federal constitution, the detective validly searched the defendant\u2019s automobile because the traffic stop was not measurably prolonged and the defendant voluntarily had consented to the search. We further conclude that the state constitution does not provide the defendant with any increased protection with respect to nontraffic related questioning and requests for consent to search during routine traffic stops. Accordingly, we reverse the judgment of the Appellate Court.</p>\n<p id=\"b234-5\">The record reveals the following facts and procedural history. On the night of May 7, 2004, Michael Morgan, a detective with the Newington police department, was patrolling the Berlin Turnpike (turnpike) in Newington in connection with a special traffic safety detail known as turnpike traffic enforcement. Morgan drove an unmarked police cruiser, but wore a full police uniform, complete with a badge, a sidearm, and a utility belt with handcuffs, pepper spray and a Stinger flashlight. At approximately 11:15 p.m., Morgan observed a Nissan Altima (Altima), operated by the defendant and proceeding northbound on the turnpike, make two abrupt lane changes without signaling. Morgan then activated his cruiser\u2019s emergency lights and initiated a traffic stop for making lane changes without signaling in violation of General Statutes \u00a7 14-242.</p>\n<p id=\"b234-6\">After Morgan stopped the Altima on the shoulder of the turnpike near its intersection with Griswoldville Avenue, a short distance south of the former Krispy Kreme doughnut shop, he radioed the Altima\u2019s Pennsylvania license plate number to his dispatcher, who checked it and did not report any matters of concern. Morgan then approached the defendant on the driver\u2019s <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"215\">*215</page-number>side of the Altima, informed him of the reason for the stop and requested his driver\u2019s license, registration and insurance papers. Morgan also questioned the defendant regarding his travel itinerary; the defendant told Morgan that he was returning from visiting his daughter in New York. The defendant then gave Morgan a New Jersey driver\u2019s license and a valid Pennsylvania rental agreement for the Altima. Morgan testified that, during this exchange and the remainder of the traffic stop, the defendant appeared \u201cunusually nervous,\u201d gave \u201cquick answers\u201d to his questions and did not make eye contact with him.</p>\n<p id=\"b235-5\">Morgan then took the defendant\u2019s papers back to his cruiser, where he checked the defendant\u2019s personal and vehicular information with his dispatcher, and learned that there were no outstanding warrants, wants or cautions pertaining to the defendant. Morgan also requested a backup officer to respond to the scene of the traffic stop, because he had decided that he was going to ask the defendant for consent to search his vehicle. Morgan then began to write an infraction ticket for the illegal lane changes.</p>\n<p id=\"b235-6\">By the time Morgan had finished writing the ticket, the backup officer and shift supervisor, Sergeant Derrick Sutton, had arrived, also wearing a full police uniform. Morgan then approached the defendant and asked him to exit his car in order better to explain the ticket.<footnotemark>5</footnotemark> Morgan then explained the ticket to the defendant, but did not give it to him at that time. On the basis of the <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"216\">*216</page-number>defendant\u2019s continued nervous demeanor and account of his travels,<footnotemark>6</footnotemark> Morgan asked him whether he had anything \u201cillegal\u201d on his person. The defendant replied that he did not have anything illegal on him, and Morgan then patted down the defendant, which did not reveal any contraband.<footnotemark>7</footnotemark> Morgan then asked whether the defendant had anything \u201cillegal\u201d in the Altima. The defendant replied that all he had in the car was some beer on the floor by the passenger seat, and told Morgan that he could \u201cgo ahead and check. You can check if you want.\u201d<footnotemark>8</footnotemark> At this point, Morgan did not inquire farther of the defendant, or advise him that he could refuse to allow Morgan to search the car. Morgan then instructed the defendant to stand with Sutton, and Morgan began to search the interior of the Altima. Morgan testified that, during the stop, neither he nor Sutton had drawn their weapons, nor had handcuffed, threatened or otherwise coerced the defendant.</p>\n<p id=\"b236-5\">Morgan began his search of the Altima on the driver\u2019s side of the vehicle and immediately proceeded to open a closed compartment in its center console, where he found a package wrapped in white tissue paper. The tissue paper concealed a plastic bag that contained a white powder substance that Morgan identified as cocaine. At that point, Morgan stopped the search, handcuffed the defendant and placed him under arrest. Following the defendant\u2019s arrest, a search of the rest of the Altima, including the backseat and trunk area, revealed additional cocaine and a large quantity of heroin.<footnotemark>9</footnotemark> From the time that Morgan initiated the stop, until <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"217\">*217</page-number>he obtained consent to search, only ten to fifteen minutes had elapsed, a period of time that he testified was consistent with an average traffic stop. The entire stop lasted at most twenty minutes, from its inception until the defendant\u2019s arrest.</p>\n<p id=\"b237-5\">Thereafter, the state charged the defendant with two counts of possession of narcotics by a person who is not drug-dependent in violation of \u00a7 2 la-278 (a) and (b),<footnotemark>10</footnotemark> and one count each of possession of narcotics in violation of General Statutes \u00a7 21a-279 (a), possession of drug paraphernalia in violation of General Statutes \u00a7 2 la-267 (a), and making an improper turn without a signal in violation of \u00a7 14-242. The defendant then moved to suppress all evidence seized from him and his vehicle, claiming that the traffic stop was impermissibly extended without probable cause or reasonable and articulable suspicion, and also that he had not voluntarily consented to the search of his vehicle.</p>\n<p id=\"b237-6\">The trial court, <em>Alexander, J., </em>following an eviden-tiary hearing at which Morgan was the only witness, denied the defendant\u2019s motion to suppress. The trial court found that the state had proven by a preponderance of the evidence that the defendant had \u201cfreely and voluntarily given consent ... in the search of his motor vehicle\u201d because \u201cthe initial motor vehicle stop was a result of observed traffic violations; the length <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"218\">*218</page-number>of the stop was brief (no more than fifteen minutes); the conduct of the officer was professional and not overbearing; the defendant told the officer to check his vehicle for illegal items; [and] the defendant did not withdraw his consent at any time.\u201d Noting that it was appropriate for Morgan to ask the defendant to exit his car during the stop; see generally <em>Pennsylvania </em>v. <em>Mimms, </em>434 U.S. 106, 98 S. Ct. 330, 54 L. Ed. 2d 331 (1977); <em>State </em>v. <em>Dukes, </em>209 Conn. 98, 547 A.2d 10 (1988); the trial court then specifically declined to credit the defendant\u2019s claim that \u201chis statement to the police that evening was meant only to have the officer look at the beer in his car,\u201d considering the defendant\u2019s spontaneous response to Morgan\u2019s inquiry about the presence of illegal items to be \u201cunambiguous: go ahead and check.\u201d Following the denial of his motion to suppress, the defendant pleaded nolo contendere, conditioned on his right to appeal, pursuant to General Statutes \u00a7 54-94a,<footnotemark>11</footnotemark> to one count of possession of narcotics with intent to sell by a person who is not drug-dependent in violation of \u00a7 21a-278 (b). The trial court, <em>Handy, J., </em>then sentenced the defendant to twenty years imprisonment, execution suspended after eight years, and five years probation.</p>\n<p id=\"b238-5\">The defendant appealed from the judgment of conviction to the Appellate Court, which concluded that the trial court should have suppressed the evidence taken from the defendant\u2019s car because he \u201cwas unlawfully detained . . . his consent to search the vehicle was <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"219\">*219</page-number>tainted by that illegal detention and . . . the state failed to purge the taint of the illegal detention.\u201d <em>State </em>v. <em>Jenkins, </em>supra, 104 Conn. App. 424. The Appellate Court stated that, under <em>Terry </em>v. <em>Ohio, </em>392 U.S. 1, 88 S. Ct. 1868, 20 L. Ed. 2d 889 (1968), \u201c[i]n determining if a seizure has exceeded the scope of a permissible motor vehicle stop, the court must determine whether the officer\u2019s action was justified at its inception and whether it was reasonably related in scope to the circumstances that justified the interference in the first place.\u201d <em>State </em>v. <em>Jenkins, </em>supra, 427. Emphasizing that the validity of the initial stop was uncontested; id.; the Appellate Court then observed that \u201cMorgan did not embark on his inquiry into whether the defendant was engaged in other illegal activity until <em>after </em>Morgan had (1) completed a check of the defendant\u2019s license and determined that it was valid and that there were no outstanding warrants for him, (2) examined the car rental agreement and determined that it appeared in order and that the time frame for the rental was valid and (3) returned to the defendant\u2019s vehicle, had him exit the vehicle and explained the traffic ticket to the defendant. Accordingly, [the Appellate Court concluded that] the record clearly reveal[ed] that Morgan\u2019s inquiry into other suspected illegal activity came after Morgan\u2019s purpose for effectuating the stop had been achieved.\u201d<footnotemark>12</footnotemark> (Emphasis in original.) Id., 428-29.</p>\n<p id=\"b239-5\">Having concluded that the stop had been extended beyond the time necessary to effectuate its initial purpose, the Appellate Court then concluded that the <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"220\">*220</page-number>state\u2019s evidence \u201cdid not establish that Morgan had reasonable suspicion to expand the scope of the stop into an inquiry of whether the defendant was engaged in illegal activity unrelated to the underlying stop or that Morgan was proceeding on anything more than a mere hunch. Therefore, once Morgan began to question the defendant about unrelated illegal activity, the formerly valid motor vehicle stop morphed into an illegally prolonged seizure of the defendant.\u201d Id., 434. Applying the three factor test articulated in <em>Brown </em>v. <em>Illinois, </em>422 U.S. 590, 603-604, 95 S. Ct. 2254, 45 L. Ed. 2d 416 (1975), to determine whether the taint of police misconduct has been attenuated,<footnotemark>13</footnotemark> the Appellate Court further determined that the defendant\u2019s consent was tainted by the improper detention and that the state had not purged that taint because the consent was given while the defendant was illegally detained, that there were no intervening circumstances such as an admonition that the defendant had the right to refuse the search, and that Morgan\u2019s official misconduct was particularly flagrant on the basis of his testimony that he had patted the defendant down without any justifiable basis. <em>State </em>v. <em>Jenkins, </em>supra, 104 Conn. App. 434-36. Accordingly, the Appellate Court reversed the defendant\u2019s conviction and remanded the case to the trial court with direction to grant the defendant\u2019s motion to suppress.<footnotemark>14</footnotemark> Id., 437. <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"221\">*221</page-number>This certified appeal followed. See footnote 3 of this opinion.</p>\n<p id=\"b241-5\">On appeal to this court, the state argues that the Appellate Court improperly: (1) relied on an inadequate record and reached out to decide claims not properly raised before the trial court, specifically whether Morgan improperly had patted down the defendant prior to obtaining his consent to search the Altima; and (2) concluded that, under the federal constitution, the scope or length of a traffic stop must be limited to its initial purpose, particularly given that there was probable cause that the defendant had committed two traffic violations in Morgan\u2019s presence. In response, the defendant strongly disagrees, and also argues as alternative grounds for affirming the judgment of the Appellate Court that: (1) his consent to search was involuntary; (2) Morgan\u2019s search exceeded the scope of the defendant\u2019s consent; and (3) Morgan obtained the defendant\u2019s consent to search in violation of article first, \u00a7 7, of the <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"222\">*222</page-number>Connecticut constitution, which he posits provides greater specific protections for motorists than does the federal constitution.</p>\n<p id=\"b242-5\">\u201cOur standard of review of a trial court\u2019s findings and conclusions in connection with a motion to suppress is well defined. A finding of fact will not be disturbed unless it is clearly erroneous in view of the evidence and pleadings in the whole record .... [W]here the legal conclusions of the court are challenged, we must determine whether they are legally and logically correct and whether they find support in the facts set out in the memorandum of decision .... We undertake a more probing factual review when a constitutional question hangs in the balance.\u201d (Citation omitted; internal quotation marks omitted.) <em>State </em>v. <em>Burroughs, </em>288 Conn. 836, 843, 955 A.2d 43 (2008). The issues presented in this appeal concern the articulation and application of the relevant federal and state constitutional rules governing the conduct of routine traffic stops. Unless specifically noted; see part IIB of this opinion; we agree with the defendant that they present questions of law over which our review is plenary.</p>\n<p id=\"b242-6\">I</p>\n<p id=\"b242-7\">ADEQUACY OF THE RECORD FOR REVIEW OF CLAIMS PERTAINING TO THE PATDOWN SEARCH OF THE DEFENDANT</p>\n<p id=\"b242-8\">Given the fact sensitive nature of constitutional suppression inquiries, we begin with the state\u2019s claim that the Appellate Court improperly considered the fact of an illegal patdown search in agreeing with the defendant\u2019s contention that his consent to search the Altima was tainted by the previously performed illegal search. The state notes that the issue was not raised in the defendant\u2019s motion to suppress or litigated during the suppression hearing, and relies on <em>State </em>v. <em>Brunetti, </em><page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"223\">*223</page-number>279 Conn. 39, 901 A.2d 1 (2006), cert. denied, 549 U.S. 1212, 127 S. Ct. 1328, 167 L. Ed. 2d 85 (2007), and <em>State </em>v. <em>Medina, </em>228 Conn. 281, 636 A.2d 351 (1994), to contend that the record is, therefore, inadequate for review of this unpreserved claim pursuant to <em>State </em>v. <em>Golding, </em>213 Conn. 233, 239-40, 567 A.2d 823 (1989). In response, the defendant contends that the Appellate Court properly considered evidence in the record of the suppression hearing because the trial court failed to make detailed findings of fact, and emphasizes that he complied with his obligation to ensure a record adequate for appellate review by filing a motion for articulation, the trial court\u2019s denial of which was upheld by the Appellate Court. We conclude that the defendant\u2019s failure to litigate the validity of the patdown during the suppression hearing rendered the record inadequate for <em>Golding </em>review of this issue, and that the Appellate Court improperly considered any impropriety with respect to the patdown in its analysis of the defendant\u2019s claims.</p>\n<p id=\"b243-5\">The record reveals the following additional relevant facts and procedural history. When the defendant moved the trial court to suppress the narcotics found in the Altima, he claimed that the evidence was the fruit of an illegal search and seizure, namely, his detention \u201cfor an extended period without probable cause or a reasonable and articulable suspicion that the defendant was engaged in illegal activity . . . .\u2019\u2019In his motion, the defendant contended that, \u201c[a]t no time did [he] voluntarily consent to the search of his vehicle,\u201d any consent obtained \u201cwas tainted by the illegal action of [the] officers,\u201d and that he \u201cdid not feel free to leave or decline to answer any questions posed by the officer due to the circumstances of the time of day, the number of officers called to the scene, and the fact that [he] was alone.\u201d The defendant did not mention or question the legality of the patdown in his motion to suppress.</p>\n<p id=\"b244-4\"><page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"224\">*224</page-number>Following the suppression hearing, at which Morgan testified briefly about the patdown,<footnotemark>15</footnotemark> the parties briefed and then argued the case orally before the trial court. In his memorandum of law, the defendant mentioned the patdown search in the statement of the facts, and then noted only that \u201cthe extended detention of the defendant and the warrantless search of his vehicle were not conducted to promote officer safety or to preserve evidence. . . . Morgan failed to articulate what crime he had reason to suspect the defendant was committing and stated that at the time of the patdown search, he did not suspect that the defendant was carrying a weapon. These factors, which must be considered when determining whether the seizure of the defendant was reasonable under the circumstances, do not balance in favor of governmental intrusion into the defendant\u2019s liberty.\u201d The defendant did not mention the patdown in examining the totality of the circumstances and arguing that his consent was not voluntarily given.<footnotemark>16</footnotemark> The state did not mention the patdown in its memorandum in opposition, nor did the trial court discuss the patdown in its memorandum of decision.</p>\n<p id=\"b245-4\"><page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"225\">*225</page-number>After the defendant appealed to the Appellate Court, he contended specifically that, \u201c(1) even if his consent to search the vehicle had been voluntary, it was tainted by a <em>prior, unconstitutional search of his person, </em>(2) the state failed to establish that he actually consented to the search of the vehicle, (3) any consent to search was not given voluntarily and (4) any consent to search was obtained by a violation of the Connecticut constitution by the police improperly converting a traffic stop into a criminal investigation.\u201d<footnotemark>17</footnotemark> (Emphasis added.) <em>State </em>v. <em>Jenkins, </em>supra, 104 Conn. App. 423-24; see also id., 427-28 (\u201cthe defendant\u2019s relevant claim on appeal relates to whether Morgan improperly expanded the scope of the stop by questioning the defendant about whether he was engaged in unrelated illegal activity and then performing a search of the defendant\u2019s person and his car, after the initial purpose for effectuating the stop had been achieved\u201d). In connection with seeking <em>Golding </em>review of this claim, the defendant moved for an articulation seeking to have the trial court answer, inter alia: \u201cAfter the defendant was ordered from his car, did . . . Morgan search the defendant\u2019s person and, if so, for what purpose? . . . Did the court find that the search of the defendant was reasonable? Did the court consider the search of defendant\u2019s person in determining whether the subsequent search of the defendant\u2019s car was constitutional?\u201d The state did not take a position on the defendant\u2019s motion, but the trial court denied it. Thereafter, the Appellate Court granted the defendant\u2019s motion for review of that denial, but denied the relief requested.<footnotemark>18</footnotemark></p>\n<p id=\"b246-4\"><page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"226\">*226</page-number>Subsequently, the Appellate Court agreed with the state\u2019s argument that \u201cthe issue of whether the defendant\u2019s person was illegally searched was not raised in the trial court and that the record is inadequate to establish whether the defendant consented to the search of his person,\u201d and noted that, \u201ceven if we assume arguendo that an illegal search of the defendant\u2019s person occurred, this, in and of itself, does not necessarily invalidate the search of the defendant\u2019s car.\u201d <em>State </em>v. <em>Jenkins, </em>supra, 104 Conn. App. 428 n.11. Nevertheless, after determining that the defendant\u2019s consent followed an unlawfully prolonged detention, the Appellate Court, in applying the three factor attenuation test articulated in <em>Brown </em>v. <em>Illinois, </em>supra, 422 U.S. 603-604; see footnote 13 of this opinion; the third factor of which considers the \u201cpuipose and flagrancy of the police misconduct\u201d; <em>Brown </em>v. <em>Illinois, </em>supra, 604; stated that: \u201cMorgan testified that he conducted a patdown search of the defendant although he did not believe that the defendant was armed. <em>While the record is inadequate to determine whether the defendant\u2019s person was illegally searched, it is disconcerting that the officer testified that he conducted such a patdown without any justifiable basis.\u201d </em>(Emphasis added.) <em>State </em>v. <em>Jenkins, </em>supra, 436; see also id., 428 n.11 (\u201cas discussed herein, the fact that the defendant was patted down prior to the search of his car is relevant to whether his consent was tainted\u201d).</p>\n<p id=\"b246-5\">Before this court, the defendant renews his argument, accepted by the Appellate Court, that, under <em>Brown </em>v. <em>Illinois, </em>supra, 422 U.S. 603-604, the illegal patdown demonstrates that Morgan had engaged in \u201cflagrant\u201d misconduct by extending the stop. The defendant also relies on the patdown in support of his alternative ground for affirming the judgment of the Appellate <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"227\">*227</page-number>Court, namely, that his consent was involuntary because the \u201csearch of [the defendant\u2019s] person signified that he was already being treated as if he were under arrest,\u201d and the patdown violated \u201ca fundamental principle of constitutional law that [the] police may not touch a citizen without justification.\u201d</p>\n<p id=\"b247-5\">The defendant\u2019s various claims in this certified appeal are an amalgam of issues both preserved and unpre-served in the trial court. With respect to those issues that are unpreserved, he seeks review pursuant to <em>State </em>v. <em>Golding, </em>supra, 213 Conn. 239-40, under which \u201ca defendant can prevail on a claim of constitutional error not preserved at trial only if all of the following conditions are met: (1) the record is adequate to review the alleged claim of error; (2) the claim is of constitutional magnitude alleging the violation of a fundamental right; (3) the alleged constitutional violation clearly exists and clearly deprived the defendant of a fair trial; and (4) if subject to harmless error analysis, the state has failed to demonstrate harmlessness of the alleged constitutional violation beyond a reasonable doubt. In the absence of any one of these conditions, the defendant\u2019s claim will fail.\u201d To the extent that the defendant relies on the patdown in support of his constitutional claims, the legality of the frisk itself implicates the <em>Golding </em>rule because the defendant did not raise that issue before the trial court.</p>\n<p id=\"b247-8\">Our recent case law addressing whether a record is adequate for review under the first prong of <em>Golding </em>makes clear that this preservation exception operates in a very restrictive manner, particularly in the fact sensitive context of illegal search and seizure claims. The leading recent decision on this topic is <em>State </em>v. <em>Brunetti, </em>supra, 279 Conn. 42, wherein we declined to review the defendant\u2019s claim, made for the first time on appeal, \u201cthat he was entitled to a new trial because, even though his father had consented to the search [of <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"228\">*228</page-number>the defendant\u2019s home], the search was constitutionally infirm because the defendant\u2019s mother, who was present when the police obtained the father\u2019s consent, declined to consent to the search.\u201d Specifically, before the trial court, the defendant\u2019s motion to suppress bloody clothing found in the home where he had lived with his parents, and the confession that followed his arrest, focused solely on the validity of his father\u2019s consent to the search, on the ground that his father had been improperly induced to agree to the search. Id., 48-49. The suppression hearing transcript subsequently revealed that the defendant\u2019s mother had refused to sign the written consent form proffered by the police, but neither the state nor defense counsel inquired further about the mother\u2019s refusal to sign the consent form, despite the fact that she had testified at the hearing. Id., 49-50. The trial court\u2019s ruling on the defendant\u2019s motion to suppress concluded that \u201cthe defendant\u2019s father\u2019s consent to search was knowing and voluntary, and, therefore, constitutionally valid.\u201d Id., 50. After the defendant was convicted of murder and filed an appeal, he moved for articulation of numerous questions, including whether his mother \u201c \u2018decline [d] to give her consent for a search of the house?\u2019 \u201d Id., 52. The trial court denied the motion for an articulation, and we subsequently declined to order it to issue the requested articulation. Id., 53-54.</p>\n<p id=\"b248-5\">We thereafter concluded that the record was inadequate for review of the defendant\u2019s joint consent claim under the first prong of <em>Golding. </em>Id., 56-64. We rejected his argument that the trial court\u2019s statement, in ruling on his suppression motion, that \u201c[i]t is clear that at least one of the parties, one of the parents, declined to consent to [the] search,\u201d \u201cperfected the record for review because it [constituted] a finding, supported by [the] evidence, that the defendant\u2019s mother had declined to consent to the search.\u201d (Internal quotation <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"229\">*229</page-number>marks omitted.) Id., 56. We disagreed with the defendant\u2019s reliance on testimony that his mother had declined to <em>sign </em>the consent form, and emphasized that, \u201cthe act of declining to sign a <em>consent </em>to search form is not tantamount to a refusal to consent to the search; rather, it is simply one of several relevant factors that a court considers in determining the validity of a consent to search. . . . Because the refusal to sign a consent to search form is one of several factors to be considered in determining the validity of consent, such refusal does not vitiate consent otherwise found to be valid in light of all of the circumstances.\u201d (Citation omitted; emphasis in original.) Id.</p>\n<p id=\"b249-5\">Most importantly, we emphasized that, \u201cbecause the defendant\u2019s motions to suppress did not implicate the mother\u2019s consent or lack thereof, the state was not on notice that it was required to establish, on the basis of the totality of the circumstances, that the defendant\u2019s mother had consented to or acquiesced in the search. In such circumstances, the state bears no responsibility for the evidentiary lacunae, and, therefore, it would be manifestly unfair to the state for this court to reach the merits of the defendant\u2019s claim upon a mere <em>assumption </em>that the defendant\u2019s mother had declined to consent to the search.\u201d<footnotemark>19</footnotemark> (Emphasis in original.) Id., 59; see also id., 62 (\u201cbecause the state had no obligation or incentive to adduce any evidence regarding the moth<page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"230\">*230</page-number>er\u2019s consent or lack thereof, no <em>conclusion </em>\u2014 indeed, <em>no inference </em>\u2014 reasonably can be drawn from her failure to sign the form\u201d [emphasis added]). Accordingly, we concluded that \u201cthe defendant has failed to satisfy the first prong of <em>Golding </em>because the facts revealed by the record are inadequate to establish whether the alleged constitutional violation did, in fact, occur.\u201d<footnotemark>20</footnotemark> Id., 64.</p>\n<p id=\"b250-5\">Our other recent case law is consistent with <em>Brunetti </em>and makes clear that we consistently have declined to grant <em>Golding </em>review to fourth amendment claims wherein the predicate factual record was not completely developed before the trial court. See <em>State </em>v. <em>Dalzell, </em>282 Conn. 709, 721, 924 A.2d 809 (2007) (This court declined to decide whether pretextual traffic stops violate the state constitution because \u201cthe trial court . . . made no findings regarding [the officer\u2019s] motivation for stopping the defendant\u2019s vehicle. Furthermore, to allow this claim to be presented for the first time on appeal would work a grave injustice on the state as it did not have any opportunity to develop a factual record to dispute the defendant\u2019s claim of pretext.\u201d); <em>State </em>v. <em>Canales, </em>281 Conn. 572, 582, 916 A.2d 767 (2007) (following <em>Brunetti </em>and finding record inadequate for review of claim that defendant\u2019s statements were product of illegal arrest \u201cbecause the defen<page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"231\">*231</page-number>dant did not argue at the suppression hearing that the arrest lacked probable cause, [and] the state did not offer evidence concerning probable cause\u201d); accord <em>State </em>v. <em>Batts, </em>281 Conn. 682, 694, 916 A.2d 788 (defendant could not prove constitutional violation under third prong of <em>Golding </em>with respect to claim that state should bear \u201cheightened standard of proof\u2019 for justifying stops based on racial profiling because record was \u201centirely devoid of evidence of racial profiling\u201d), cert. denied, 552 U.S. 1047, 128 S. Ct. 667, 169 L. Ed. 2d 524 (2007).</p>\n<p id=\"b251-4\">Thus, we agree with the state that the Appellate Court improperly considered <em>any </em>illegality attendant to Morgan\u2019s patdown of the defendant. Given the fact that the state was not alerted to the need to develop a factual record concerning whether potentially permissible bases, such as consent,<footnotemark>21</footnotemark>, existed for the patdown search, we conclude that it was improper for the Appellate Court to label the patdown negatively or to draw any adverse inferences from it on the basis of Morgan\u2019s testimony, which may not have presented a complete picture of what had occurred with respect to the pat-down. Thus, we decline to consider the patdown as anything other than a historical fact, and ascribe to it no legal significance.</p>\n<p id=\"b251-5\">II</p>\n<p id=\"b251-6\">FEDERAL CONSTITUTIONAL CLAIMS</p>\n<p id=\"b251-7\">Accordingly, we now turn to the federal constitutional issues presented by the present case. First, we must consider whether Morgan\u2019s acts of questioning the defendant about topics unrelated to the reason for the traffic stop, as well as asking for consent to search, were themselves constitutionally permissible during a <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"232\">*232</page-number>routine traffic stop. If we conclude that they were, we then must address the defendant\u2019s alternative grounds for affirmance under the federal constitution, namely that: (1) his consent was not voluntary; and (2) Morgan\u2019s search exceeded the scope of the defendant\u2019s consent.</p>\n<p id=\"b252-5\">A</p>\n<p id=\"b252-6\">Permissible Scope of Investigation during Routine Traffic Stops</p>\n<p id=\"b252-7\">The state, relying on <em>Arizona </em>v. <em>Johnson, </em>supra, 555 U.S. 323, and <em>Ohio </em>v. <em>Robinette, </em>supra, 519 U.S. 33, claims that, under the restrictions of <em>Terry </em>v. <em>Ohio, </em>supra, 392 U.S. 1, questioning during a routine traffic stop need not be carefully tailored to the initial purpose of the stop, so long as the stop\u2019s overall duration is not \u201cmeasurably extended\u201d beyond the time necessary to accomplish the tasks attendant to that reason for the stop. In response, the defendant contends that Morgan ordered him from his car at a point when the traffic stop should have ended with the issuance of the traffic ticket and the return of the defendant\u2019s papers, thus creating an independent stop for <em>Terry </em>purposes that improperly lacked its own separate basis of reasonable suspicion beyond the moving violation. The defendant further argues that, because Morgan had not yet issued the ticket and had retained his documentation, the defendant was not free to leave at the time Morgan asked for consent to search, thereby rendering his consent the fruit of an improper stop not supported by reasonable suspicion. We conclude that Morgan\u2019s questions, including his request for consent to search, were permissible because they did not measurably extend the duration of the traffic stop.</p>\n<p id=\"b252-8\">Courts considering the constitutionality under the fourth amendment of a police officer\u2019s interaction with a motorist during a routine traffic stop apply the principles developed under the line of case law implementing the central holding of <em>Terry </em>v. <em>Ohio, </em>supra, 392 U.S. <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"233\">*233</page-number>1.<footnotemark>22</footnotemark> See, e.g., <em>Arizona </em>v. <em>Johnson, </em>supra, 555 U.S. 330; <em>Berkemer v. McCarty, </em>468 U.S. 420, 439, 104 S. Ct. 3138, 82 L. Ed. 2d 317 (1984); <em>United States </em>v. <em>Bell, </em>555 F.3d 535, 539-40 (6th Cir.), cert. denied, 557 U.S. 945, 129 S.

State, </em>280 Ga. 735, 736-37, 632 S.E.2d 645 (2006); <em>State </em>v. <em>Washington, </em>898 N.E.2d 1200, 1204 (Ind. 2008). Under <em>Terry, </em>\u201cwhere a police officer observes unusual conduct which leads him reasonably to conclude in light of his experience that criminal activity may be afoot . . . the officer may briefly stop the suspicious person and make reasonable inquiries aimed at confirming or dispelling his suspicions. . . .</p>\n<p id=\"b254-4\"><page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"234\">*234</page-number>\u201cIt is well established, however, that [t]he police officer is not entitled to seize and search every person whom he sees on the street or of whom he makes inquiries. Before he places a hand on the person of a citizen in search of anything, he must have constitutionally adequate, reasonable grounds for doing so. In the case of the self-protective search for weapons, he must be able to point to particular facts from which he reasonably inferred that the individual was armed and dangerous. . . . The authority to permit a reasonable search for weapons for the protection of the police officer is narrowly drawn applying only where he has reason to believe that he is dealing with an armed and dangerous individual .... The officer need not be absolutely certain that the individual is armed; the issue is whether a reasonably prudent man in the circumstances would be warranted in the belief that his safety or that of others was in danger. . . . And in determining whether the officer acted reasonably in such circumstances, due weight must be given, not to his inchoate and unparticularized suspicion or hunch, but to the specific reasonable inferences which he is entitled to draw from the facts in light of his experience.\u201d (Citations omitted; internal quotation marks omitted.) <em>State </em>v. <em>Nash, </em>278 Conn. 620, 631-32, 899 A.2d 1 (2006).</p>\n<p id=\"b254-5\">A <em>Terry </em>stop does not give law enforcement officers carte blanche to stop and detain citizens indefinitely or unreasonably because, \u201cif an investigative stop continues indefinitely, at some point it can no longer be justified as an investigative stop. But our cases impose no rigid time limitation on <em>Terry </em>stops. While it is clear that the brevity of the invasion of the individual\u2019s [f|ourth [ajmendment interests is an important factor in determining whether the seizure is so minimally intrusive as to be justifiable on reasonable suspicion . . . we have emphasized the need to consider the law enforcement purposes to be served by the stop as well <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"235\">*235</page-number>as the time reasonably needed to effectuate those purposes.\u201d (Citation omitted; internal quotation marks omitted.) <em>United States </em>v. <em>Sharpe, </em>470 U.S. 675, 685, 105 S. Ct. 1568, 84 L. Ed. 2d 605 (1985). Thus, the Supreme Court has rejected attempts to impose \u201ca hard- and-fast time limit\u201d on <em>Terry </em>stops, in favor of a reasonableness inquiry where, \u201c[i]n assessing whether a detention is too long in duration to be justified as an investigative stop, we consider it appropriate to examine whether the police diligently pursued a means of investigation that was likely to confirm or dispel their suspicions quickly, during which time it was necessary to detain the defendant. ... A court making this assessment should take care to consider whether the police are acting in a swiftly developing situation, and in such cases the court should not indulge in unrealistic second-guessing.\u201d (Citations omitted.) Id., 686.</p>\n<p id=\"b255-5\">Applying this reasoning in the traffic stop context, the United States Supreme Court recently followed <em>Muehler </em>v. <em>Mena, </em>supra, 544 U.S. 100-101, wherein it had determined that the police did not violate the fourth amendment rights of a woman detained during the execution of a search warrant by questioning her about her immigration status,<footnotemark>23</footnotemark> and concluded that \u201c[a] lawful <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"236\">*236</page-number>roadside stop begins when a vehicle is pulled over for investigation of a traffic violation. The temporary seizure of driver and passengers ordinarily continues, and remains reasonable, for the duration of the stop. Normally, the stop ends when the police have no further need to control the scene, and inform the driver and passengers they are free to leave. ... An officer\u2019s inquiries into matters unrelated to the justification for the traffic stop, this [c]ourt has made plain, do not convert the encounter into something other than a lawful seizure, <em>so long as those inquiries do not measurably extend the duration of the stop.\u2019</em><footnotemark><em>24</em></footnotemark><em> </em>(Citation omitted; emphasis added.) <em>Arizona </em>v. <em>Johnson, </em>supra, 555 U.S. 333; see id., 327, 334 (concluding that passenger was seized incident to lawful traffic stop of driver and that police officer properly could frisk passenger with reasonable suspicion that he was armed and dangerous); see also <em>Illinois </em>v. <em>Caballes, </em>543 U.S. 405, 408-409, 125 S.

LaFave, Search and Seizure (4th Ed. 2004 &amp; 2009-2010 Sup.) \u00a7 9.3, p. 91.</p>\n<p id=\"b257-5\">Thus, questions permissible under <em>Terry </em>during a routine traffic stop include inquiries about whether the car or driver are carrying contraband, as well as concomitant requests for consent to search the vehicle. See 4 W. LaFave, supra (4th Ed. 2004), \u00a7 9.3 (d), p. 389 and \u00a7 9.3 (e), p. 397, and (2009-2010 Sup.), \u00a7 9.3, pp. 91, 94 (noting that <em>Illinois </em>v. <em>Caballes, </em>supra, 543 U.S. 405, supports requests for consent to search that do not extend duration of stop). These inquiries are permissible even if they are irrelevant to the initial purpose of the stop, namely, the traffic violation, so long as they do not \u201cmeasurably extend\u201d the stop beyond the time necessary to complete the investigation of the traffic violation and issue a citation or warning. Consideration of that time period necessarily includes the completion of tasks attendant to the traffic stop, including \u201ca check of the driver\u2019s license, vehicle registration, and criminal history, and the writing of the citation or warning,\u201d as well as background questions about the destination and purpose of the driver\u2019s trip. <em>United States </em>v. <em>OliveraMendez, </em>484 F.3d 505, 509 (8th Cir. 2007); see also, e.g., <em>Salmeron </em>v. <em>State, </em>supra, 280 Ga. 737 (\u201c[i]t does not unreasonably expand the scope or duration of a valid traffic stop for an officer to prolong the stop to immediately investigate and determine if the driver is entitled to continue to operate the vehicle by checking the status of the driver\u2019s license, insurance, and vehicle registration\u201d [internal quotation marks omitted]). Indeed, given that complications with respect to these tasks may well result in an extension of the time of detention without <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"238\">*238</page-number>rendering it unreasonable under the fourth amendment, \u201c[w]hether aparticular detention is reasonable in length is a fact-intensive question, and there is no per se time limit on all traffic stops.\u201d <em>United States </em>v. <em>OliveraMendez, </em>supra, 510; see also <em>Byndloss </em>v.

See, e.g., <em>United States </em>v. <em>White, </em>584 F.3d 935, 949 (10th Cir. 2009), cert. denied, 559 U.S. 985, 130 S. Ct. 1721, 176 L.

App. 3d 1, 8-9, 908 N.E.2d 538 (2009) (traffic stop was prolonged beyond time necessary to issue summons for cracked windshield by continuing to question defendant, eventually obtaining consent to search vehicle). Moreover, judicial review of routine traffic stops goes beyond a strict stopwatch test; reasonableness is not measured solely by the temporal duration of the stop alone but, rather, requires scrupulous consideration of the reasonableness of the officers\u2019 actions during the time of the stop. See <em>United States </em><page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"243\">*243</page-number>v. <em>Peralez, </em>526 F.3d 1115, 1119-21 (8th Cir. 2008) (traffic stop, while lasting only sixteen minutes, was unreasonably extended when questions unrelated to purpose of stop \u201cconstituted the bulk of the interaction between the trooper and the van\u2019s occupants\u201d and video recording showed that \u201coff-topic questions more than doubled the time [the defendant] was detained\u201d).</p>\n<p id=\"b263-5\">A review of the Appellate Court\u2019s opinion in the present case indicates, then, that it did not apply the correct legal standard, in that it relied on <em>pre-Muehler </em>case law,<footnotemark>26</footnotemark> and stated that, \u201c[i]n determining if a seizure has <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"244\">*244</page-number>exceeded the scope of a permissible motor vehicle stop, the court must determine whether the officer\u2019s action was justified at its inception and whether it was reasonably related in scope to the circumstances that justified the interference in the first place. See <em>State </em>v. <em>Carcare, </em>75 Conn. App. 756, 767, 818 A.2d 53 (2003); see also <em>United States </em>v. <em>Jones, </em>234 F.3d 234, 240-41 (5th Cir. 2000) (holding that although initial stop of defendants\u2019 vehicle for speeding was valid, continued detention, after completing computer check on drivers\u2019 licenses and rental papers revealed clean records, was unreasonable and violated fourth amendment).<footnotemark>27</footnotemark> With respect to <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"245\">*245</page-number>whether the results of the initial stop aroused further suspicion warranting a prolonged inquiry, [t]he police officer\u2019s decision . . . must be based on more than a hunch or speculation. ...

In so concluding, we note that it is undisputed that the traffic stop for unsignaled lane changes was valid at its inception, and also that, under <em>Pennsylvania </em>v. <em>Mimms, </em>supra, 434 U.S. 111 and n.6, Morgan properly ordered the defendant to step out of the car for purposes of explaining the ticket. The total relevant duration of the stop, namely, from the time that the defendant was pulled over until the time that he gave his consent to the search of the Altima, was at most fifteen minutes; indeed, the defendant was under arrest twenty minutes from the inception of the stop. See <em>United States </em>v. <em>Rivera, </em>supra, 570 F.3d 1013-14 (\u201cwhen a motorist gives consent to search his vehicle, he necessarily consents to an extension of the traffic stop while the search is conducted\u201d). Moreover, during that fifteen minute time period prior to searching the defendant\u2019s Altima, Morgan engaged only in activities that themselves related directly to the traffic stop, namely, questioning the defendant about his travels, checking the defendant\u2019s license and rental agreement, performing a warrants check and then writing the ticket. Morgan asked only two brief off-topic questions concerning the presence of illegalities in the vehicle or on the defendant\u2019s person near the end of the stop, after explaining the ticket to the defendant, but before <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"247\">*247</page-number>giving it to Mm.<footnotemark>29</footnotemark> Unlike the protracted questioning in <em>United States </em>v. <em>Peralez, </em>supra, 526 F.3d 1120-21, which dominated the encounter in that case, these two questions in the present case did not create more than a de minimis extension of the overall stop, and therefore <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"248\">*248</page-number>were permissible under <em>Muehler </em>and <em>Johnson. </em>Moreover, Morgan did not need to delay the stop in order to conduct the search, as Sutton, his backup officer, arrived while he was still in the process of writing the ticket. Accordingly, we conclude that the traffic stop was not unreasonably prolonged and was not an illegal detention that violated the fourth amendment.</p>\n<p id=\"b268-5\">B</p>\n<p id=\"b268-6\">Whether the Defendant\u2019s Consent Was Voluntary</p>\n<p id=\"b268-7\">Having determined that the traffic stop itself was not conducted in a manner that violated the fourth amendment, we now must consider whether the defendant voluntarily consented to the search of his vehicle.<footnotemark>30</footnotemark> This is because the lawfulness of the defendant\u2019s seizure is a question different from whether the consent to search was voluntary. See, e.g., <em>United States </em>v. <em>Valenzuela, </em>494 F.3d 886, 891 (10th Cir.), cert. denied, 552 U.S. 1032, 128 S. Ct. 636, 169 L. Ed. 2d 411 (2007); <em>Salmeron </em>v. <em>State, </em>supra, 280 Ga. 739. Raising this claim as an alternate ground upon which we may affirm the judgment of the Appellate Court; see Practice Book \u00a7 84-11 (a);<footnotemark>31</footnotemark> the defendant contends that his consent <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"249\">*249</page-number>to the search of his car was not free and voluntary under the totality of the circumstances; see <em>Schneckloth </em>v. <em>Bustamonte, </em>412 U.S. 218, 248-49, 93 S. Ct. 2041, 36 L. Ed. 2d 854 (1973); because: (1) Morgan and Sutton behaved in a \u201csubtly coercive\u201d manner since they were armed, the defendant was a minority from out of state who was alone in his car, and the traffic stop took place on a dark area of the turnpike; (2) Morgan already had escalated the encounter by patting down the defendant without justification; (3) neither officer informed the defendant of his right to refuse to consent to the search; and (4) the defendant was not free to leave because Morgan had not yet returned his license, rental agreement and ticket. In response, the state contends that the trial court\u2019s findings of fact on this issue are not clearly erroneous \u2014 namely, that the police officers did not act in a coercive or deceptive manner \u2014 and further relies on the spontaneous nature of the defendant\u2019s invitation to Morgan to search his car in response to Morgan\u2019s question about the presence of any illegalities therein. Having reviewed the record, we conclude that the trial court properly determined that the defendant\u2019s consent was free and voluntary under the totality of the circumstances.</p>\n<p id=\"b269-5\">\u201cA warrantless search is not unreasonable under either the fourth amendment to the constitution of the United States or article first, \u00a7 7, of the constitution of Connecticut if a person with authority to do so has freely consented to the search. . . .

The state must affirmatively estab<page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"250\">*250</page-number>lish that the consent was voluntary; mere acquiescence to a claim of lawful authority is not enough to meet the state\u2019s burden. . . . The question whether consent to a search has in fact been freely and voluntarily given, or was the product of coercion, express or implied . . . is a question of fact to be determined from the totality of all the circumstances. ... As a question of fact, it is normally to be decided by the trial court upon the evidence before that court together with the reasonable inferences to be drawn from that evidence. . . .

Some of the factors taken into account have included the youth of the accused ... his lack of education ... or his low intelligence . . . the lack of any advice to the accused of his constitutional rights . . . the length of detention . . . the repeated and prolonged nature of the questioning . . . and the use of physical punishment such as the deprivation of food or sleep . . . .\u201d (Citations omitted.) <em>Schneckloth </em>v. <em>Busta-mante, </em>supra, 412 U.S. 226.

The Supreme Court has emphasized that this rule remains applicable to requests for consent to search during traffic stops, calling it \u201cunrealistic to require police officers to always inform detainees that they are free to go before a consent to search may be deemed voluntary.\u201d <em>Ohio </em>v. <em>Robinette, </em>supra, 519 U.S. 40 (following Schneckloth); see also, e.g., <em>People </em>v. <em>Reddersen, </em>992 P.2d 1176, 1182-83 (Colo. 2000) (consent to search given during ongoing traffic stop was voluntary, despite officer\u2019s failure to advise motorist of his right to refuse or to give warning pursuant to <em>Miranda </em>v. <em>Arizona, </em>384 U.S. 436, 478-79, 86 S.

Thus, it is significant that the defendant\u2019s consent was obtained during a routine traffic stop that, while not itself consensual in nature, also was not unreasonable by fourth amendment standards; see part II A of this opinion; which accords with the trial court\u2019s factual findings that \u201c[t]here is no evidence that the length of the stop was excessive or overbearing\u201d and that \u201c[t]he defendant was never threatened or restrained.\u201d</p>\n<p id=\"b272-5\">With respect to the remainder of the defendant\u2019s claims,<footnotemark>34</footnotemark> although the officers did not inform him of his right to refuse to consent to the search, this factor is mitigated by the spontaneity of the defendant\u2019s invitation to Morgan to check his vehicle, in response to Morgan\u2019s question limited to the presence of \u201canything illegal\u201d in the car. The spontaneous nature of that invitation, which was not given in response to a specific <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"253\">*253</page-number>request for consent to search, renders \u201cinapposite\u201d the officers\u2019 failure to advise the defendant of his right to refuse to consent to the search. <em>United States </em>v. <em>Brown, </em>563 F.3d 410, 416 (9th Cir. 2009); see also id.

The defendant has not proffered any evidence to contradict, or demonstrated a void of supporting evidence, with respect to the trial court\u2019s finding that \u201cthere was no untoward conduct on the part of either . . . Morgan or . . . Sutton\u201d and that \u201cthere was no threatening, coercive or overpowering behavior exhibited at any time during this incident.\u201d The fact that the police officers were armed with their duty sidearms does not render the atmosphere coercive, particularly as there is no evidence that the officers ever drew or unholstered their weapons. See <em>State </em>v. <em>Reynolds, </em>264 Conn. 1, 45, 836 A.2d 224 (2003) (\u201c[although the presence of <em>dravm </em>weapons is certainly a factor in determining voluntariness ... it is not dispositive\u201d [emphasis added; internal quotation marks omitted]), cert. denied, 541 U.S. 908, 124 S.

In response, the state also relies on <em>Jimeno </em>and argues that it was objectively reasonable for Morgan to construe the defendant\u2019s invitation as an actual consent to a search.

The court noted that \u201cthe terms of the search\u2019s authorization were simple\u201d because the defendant had granted the officer \u201cpermission to search his car, and did not place any explicit limitation on the scope of the search,\u201d after the officer \u201chad informed [the defendant] that he believed [the defendant] was carrying narcotics, and that he would be looking for narcotics in the car. We think that it was objectively reasonable for the police to conclude that the general consent to search [the defendant\u2019s] car included consent to search containers within that car which might bear drugs.

First, Morgan\u2019s question about the presence of \u201canything illegal\u201d in the car reasonably is understood as directing the defendant\u2019s attention to contraband such as narcotics or weapons, despite the fact that he did not mention those items specifically.<footnotemark>37</footnotemark> See <em>United States </em>v. <em>Canipe, </em><page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"257\">*257</page-number>569 F.3d 597, 606 (6th Cir.)

In response, the state contends that the defendant\u2019s proposed constitutional rules are unworkable, would vitiate the purpose of consent searches and that existing federal constitutional protections are sufficient. The state also contends that, because the record lacks evidence of racial profiling or other bias, the defendant and the amicus \u201c[ask] this <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"261\">*261</page-number>court to presume a serious impropriety\u201d in devising a new constitutional rule. We agree with the state and conclude that article first, \u00a7 7, of the Connecticut constitution does not provide criminal defendants with greater protections than does the federal constitution in the context of unrelated questioning, including requests for consent to search, made during routine traffic stops.</p>\n<p id=\"b281-5\">\u201cIt is well established that federal constitutional and statutory law establishes a minimum national standard for the exercise of individual rights and does not inhibit state governments from affording higher levels of protection for such rights. . . . Furthermore, although we often rely on the United States Supreme Court\u2019s interpretation of the amendments to the constitution of the United States to delineate the boundaries of the protections provided by the constitution of Connecticut, we have also recognized that, in some instances, our state constitution provides protections beyond those provided by the federal constitution, as that document has been interpreted by the United States Supreme Court. . . . The analytical framework by which we determine whether, in any given instance, our state constitution affords broader protection to our citizens than the federal constitutional minimum is well settled. In <em>State </em>v. <em>Geisler, </em>[supra, 222 Conn. 684-86], we enumerated the following six factors to be considered in determining that issue: (1) persuasive relevant federal precedents; (2) the text of the operative constitutional provisions; (3) historical insights into the intent of our constitutional forebears; (4) related Connecticut precedents; (5) persuasive precedents of other state courts; and (6) contemporary understandings of applicable economic and sociological norms, or as otherwise described, relevant public policies.\u201d (Internal quotation marks omitted.) <em>State </em>v. <em>McKenzie-Adams, </em>281 Conn. 486, 509-10, 915 A.2d 822, cert. denied, 552 U.S. 888, 128 S.

Although in <em>Geisler </em>we compartmentalized the factors that should be considered in order to stress that a systematic analysis is required, we recognize that they may be inextricably interwoven. . . . [N]ot every <em>Geisler </em>factor is relevant in all cases.\u201d (Citation omitted.) <em>State </em>v. Morales, 232 Conn. 707, 716 n.10, 657 A.2d 585 (1995). Moreover, a proper <em>Geisler </em>analysis does not require us simply to tally and follow the decisions favoring one party\u2019s state constitutional claim; a deeper review of those decisions\u2019 underpinnings is required because we follow only \u201cpersuasive\u201d decisions. See <em>Kerrigan </em>v. <em>Commissioner of Public Health, </em>289 Conn. 135, 240-41, 957 A.2d 407 (2008) (\u201cthe state court cases that have determined that gay persons do not constitute a quasi-suspect class, like the federal cases described in this part of the opinion, employed a flawed analysis, and, therefore, they do not constitute persuasive authority\u201d).</p>\n<p id=\"b282-5\">A</p>\n<p id=\"b282-6\">Operative Constitutional Text</p>\n<p id=\"b282-7\">With respect to the first <em>Geisler </em>factor, namely, the operative constitutional text, we agree with the state that the language of article first, \u00a7 7, does not support the defendant\u2019s claim of greater protections than are provided under the fourth amendment. See footnotes 1 and 2 of this opinion. The state provision \u201cclosely resembles\u201d the fourth amendment; <em>State </em>v. <em>Barton, </em>219 Conn. 529, 540, 594 A.2d 917 (1991); particularly as \u201cboth proscribe only unreasonable searches and seizures.\u201d <em>State </em>v. <em>Dukes, </em>supra, 209 Conn. 121; see also, e.g., <em>Washington </em>v. <em>Meachum, </em>238 Conn. 692, 719, 680 <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"263\">*263</page-number>A.2d 262 (1996) (describing provisions as \u201cvirtually identical\u201d). Although the \u201clinguistic similarity undermines the defendant\u2019s contention that the state constitution provides a greater opportunity to challenge the legality of a search than the federal constitution\u201d; <em>State </em>v. <em>Davis, </em>283 Conn. 280, 306, 929 A.2d 278 (2007); our inquiry does not end here, because \u201cthis court has never considered itself bound to adopt the federal interpretation in interpreting the Connecticut constitution. Our system of federalism requires no less. But of even weightier concern is the authority of our state constitution, the fundamental charter of our state, and it is this court\u2019s duty to interpret and enforce our constitution. Here we note that the United States Supreme Court or its individual members have often called the attention of state courts to their independent responsibility for the constitutional laws of their states. Thus, in a proper case, \u2018the law of the land\u2019 may not, in state constitutional context, also be \u2018the law of the state of Connecticut.\u2019 \u201d <em>State </em>v. <em>Dukes, </em>supra, 113-14.</p>\n<p id=\"b283-4\">B</p>\n<p id=\"b283-5\">Connecticut and Federal Case Law</p>\n<p id=\"b283-6\">We also agree with the state that contemporary federal case law governing the police conduct during routine traffic stops; see parts II A and B of this opinion; similarly does not support the defendant\u2019s interpretation of the state constitution.<footnotemark>41</footnotemark> With respect to Connecti<page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"264\">*264</page-number>cut case law, although we have in the past interpreted article first, \u00a7 7, to \u201c[afford] protections to the citizens of this state beyond those provided by the fourth amendment to the federal constitution, as that provision has been interpreted by the United States Supreme Court\u201d;<footnotemark>42</footnotemark> <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"265\">*265</page-number><em>State </em>v. <em>Wilkins, </em>240 Conn. 489, 505, 692 A.2d 1233 (1997); we also have concluded that \u201c[applications of <em>Terry </em>principles in the context of motor vehicle stops are already embodied in our state constitution.\u201d Id., 508-509. Thus, in <em>Wilkins, </em>we determined, in accordance with the United States Supreme Court\u2019s interpretation of the fourth amendment in <em>Michigan </em>v. <em>Long, </em>463 U.S. 1032, 1049, 103 S. Ct. 3469, 77 L. Ed. 2d 1201 (1983), that the state constitution permitted police officers, with reasonable and articulable suspicion that a suspect is potentially dangerous, to conduct a limited protective search of a motor vehicle for weapons dining a routine traffic stop. <em>State </em>v. <em>Wilkins, </em>supra, 509-11; see also id., 501, 504 (officer acted reasonably under state constitution by separating vehicle occupants and detaining suspect in cruiser until backup arrived to allow patdowns to be conducted safely); <em>State </em>v. <em>Dukes, </em>supra, 209 Conn. 122 (following <em>Pennsylvania </em>v. <em>Mimms, </em>supra, 434 U.S. 106, and concluding that state constitution permits police officer to require motorist to exit vehicle during routine traffic stop); accord <em>State </em>v. <em>Mikolinski, </em>256 Conn. 543, 554, 775 A.2d 274 (2001) (\u201csobriety checkpoints operated pursuant to neutral criteria are permissible under article first, \u00a7 7\u201d); <em>State </em>v. <em>Lamme, </em>216 Conn. 172, 184, 579 A.2d 484 (1990) (concluding that article first, \u00a7 9, is due process provision that does not preclude <em>Terry </em>stops or other detentions not founded upon probable cause).</p>\n<p id=\"b285-5\">Moreover, the defendant has not identified any on point Connecticut case law interpreting the federal constitution that conflicts with the federal constitutional principles recently articulated in <em>Arizona </em>v. <em>Johnson, </em><page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"266\">*266</page-number>supra, 129 S.

The search and seizure provision in our 1818 constitution, then article first, \u00a7 8, closely resembles the fourth amendment to the United States constitution. Although its enumeration was changed to article first, \u00a7 7, when the 1965 constitution incorporated article first, \u00a7 4, into article seventh, its language has not been altered since its original adoption. . . . The language of article first, \u00a7 7, which was based upon the fourth amendment, was adopted with little debate. . . . Thus, the circumstances surrounding the adoption of article first, \u00a7 7, lend weight to the view that, in most cases, a practice permitted under the fourth amendment is permissible under article first, \u00a7 7.\u201d (Citations omitted; internal quotation marks omitted.) <em>State </em>v. <em>Mikolinski, </em>supra, 256 Conn. 548-49; see also <em>State </em>v. <em>Davis, </em>supra, 283 Conn. 316 (\u201cit reasonably may be argued that the lack of any evidence indicating that article first, \u00a7 7, was intended to be more broadly protective of privacy rights than the fourth amendment gives rise to a contrary inference\u201d).</p>\n<p id=\"b287-5\">D</p>\n<p id=\"b287-6\">Sister State Case Law</p>\n<p id=\"b287-7\">The defendant relies specifically on state constitutional case law from ten states, Alaska, Kansas, Massa<page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"268\">*268</page-number>chusetts, Minnesota, Montana, New Jersey, Pennsylvania, Vermont, Washington and Wyoming in support of his argument that we should interpret article first, \u00a7 7, to preclude, in the context of a routine traffic stop, requests for consent to search and other questioning unrelated to the purpose of the stop.<footnotemark>45</footnotemark> Only those cases from Alaska, Kansas, Massachusetts, Minnesota, New Jersey, Pennsylvania and Wyoming warrant any significant discussion.<footnotemark>46</footnotemark></p>\n<p id=\"b289-4\"><page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"269\">*269</page-number>In our view, the most comprehensive and persuasive of these cited decisions is <em>State </em>v. <em>Carty, </em>170 N.J. 632, 635, 790 A.2d 903, modified, 174 N.J. 351, 806 A.2d 798 (2002), wherein the New Jersey Supreme Court concluded, under that state\u2019s constitution, that \u201cin order for a consent to search a motor vehicle and its occupants to be valid, law enforcement personnel must have a reasonable and articulable suspicion of criminal wrongdoing prior to seeking consent to search a lawfully stopped motor vehicle.\u201d The court emphasized its long history of elevating state constitutional protections beyond those provided by the fourth amendment in the area of consent searches, including its separate requirement, in contravention of <em>Schneckloth </em>v. <em>Busta-monte, </em>supra, 412 U.S. 248-49, that individuals give knowing and voluntary consent to searches. <em>State </em>v. <em>Carty, </em>supra, 639, discussing <em>State </em>v. <em>Johnson, </em>68 N.J. 349, 354, 346 A.2d 66 (1975). Most significantly, the New Jersey court also relied upon an extensive record demonstrating that state police officers frequently had utilized coercive tactics that had violated both a federal consent decree and state police policy.<footnotemark>47</footnotemark> <em>State </em>v. <em>Carty, </em><page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"270\">*270</page-number>supra, 644-45; see also id., 647 (reasonable suspicion rule \u201cserves the prophylactic purpose of preventing the police from turning a routine traffic stop into a fishing expedition for criminal activity unrelated to the stop\u201d). We decline to follow <em>Carty </em>because the record in the present case lacks the evidence of specific instances of law enforcement abuses by police officers in our jurisdiction similar to that which prompted the New Jersey court to interpret its state constitution to provide enhanced protections to motorists on that state\u2019s highways. See <em>State </em>v. <em>Snell, </em>323 Mont. 157, 161, 99 P.3d 191 (2004) (declining to follow <em>Carty </em>because defendant \u201cdoes not argue \u2014 much less establish \u2014 that Montana law enforcement officers are abusing their authority\u201d).</p>\n<p id=\"b290-5\">Like the New Jersey Supreme Court, the Minnesota Supreme Court has interpreted its state constitution to require that officers have \u201creasonable, articulable suspicion\u201d of criminal activity prior to asking for consent to search during a routine traffic stop. <em>State </em>v. <em>Fort, </em>660 N.W.2d 415, 416 (Minn. 2003). <em>Fort, </em>however, is <em>legally </em>inapposite, because in that case, the Minnesota court was constrained to follow its then recent precedent in a dog sniff case that had interpreted both the fourth amendment, <em>pre-Illinois </em>v. <em>Caballes, </em>supra, 543 U.S. 408-409, and the state constitution, to limit \u201cthe scope and duration of a traffic stop investigation . . . to the justification for the stop.\u201d<footnotemark>48</footnotemark> <em>State </em>v. <em>Fort, </em>supra, <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"271\">*271</page-number>418; see id., 418-19, discussing <em>State </em>v. <em>Wiegand, </em>645 N.W.2d 125, 135-37 (Minn. 2002) (requiring reasonable and articulable suspicion of narcotics related activity to justify exterior dog sniff of car).</p>\n<p id=\"b291-5\">Case law from the high courts of Massachusetts and Pennsylvania is similarly restrictive, as both states also do not permit police to inquire beyond the purpose of a traffic stop in the absence of a reasonable suspicion of criminal activity. The case law from these states, however, is not persuasive because of the cursory state constitutional analyses contained in those opinions. See <em>Commonwealth </em>v. Torres, 424 Mass. 153, 158, 674 N.E.2d 638 (1997) (\u201cpolice inquiry in a routine traffic stop must end on the production of a valid license and registration unless the police have grounds for inferring that either the operator or his passengers were involved in the commission of a crime ... or engaged in other suspicious conduct\u201d [internal quotation marks omitted]);<footnotemark>49</footnotemark> <em>Commonwealth </em>v. <em>Strickler, </em>563 Pa. 47, 69, 757 A.2d 884 (2000) (\u201c[o]ur jurisprudence under [the Pennsylvania constitution], however, would not sustain a consent search conducted in the context of, but which is wholly unrelated in its scope to, an ongoing detention, since there can be no constitutionally-valid detention independently or following a traffic or similar stop absent reasonable suspicion . . . and the scope of a detention is circumscribed by the reasons that justify it\u201d [citation omitted]); id., 70 n.20 (\u201c[a]s noted, <em>[Terry </em>v.

See <em>Commonwealth v. Acosta, </em>815 A.2d 1078, 1087 n.8 (Pa. Super.) (concluding on record that defendant\u2019s consent to search during traffic stop was product of coercion and citing <em>Strickler </em>in dicta for proposition that \u201cthere is some question regarding the constitutionality of [the police officer\u2019s] attempt to secure [the defendant\u2019s] consent during the investigative detention\u201d), appeal denied, 576 Pa. 710, 839 A.2d 350 (2003).</p>\n<p id=\"b292-5\">In <em>O\u2019Boyle v. State, </em>117 P.3d 401, 411 (Wyo. 2005), the Wyoming Supreme Court did not adopt a specific rule such as that followed in <em>State v. Carty, </em>supra, 170 N.J. 632, but emphasized a reasonableness inquiry <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"273\">*273</page-number>influenced by local factors, specifically, the fact that Wyoming\u2019s \u201clocation along a nationally recognized drug trafficking corridor likely results in a disproportionately large percentage of Wyoming\u2019s disproportionately small population being subjected to what have become routine requests to relinquish their privacy rights by detention, invasive questioning and searches \u2014 all without reasonable suspicion of criminal activity other than the offense giving rise to the stop.\u201d<footnotemark>51</footnotemark> Given the fact that the defendant had not yet been placed under arrest and there was no reasonable suspicion of criminal activity, the court then concluded that the scope of the traffic stop had been improperly expanded because he had been detained in the cruiser during the stop and questioned extensively about his family, travel plans and profession. <em>O\u2019Boyle </em>v. State, supra, 410. Aside from O\u2019Boyle\u2019s lack of a specific legal standard beyond reasonableness,<footnotemark>52</footnotemark> it is factually inapposite given the brief <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"274\">*274</page-number>and limited questioning that took place in this case prior <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"275\">*275</page-number>to the defendant volunteering permission for Morgan to search the Altima.<footnotemark>53</footnotemark></p>\n<p id=\"b295-5\">With respect to state constitutional decisions issued after the United States Supreme Court\u2019s decision in <em>Muehler v. Mena, </em>supra, 544 U.S. 93, the Kansas decision relied upon by both Justice Katz in her dissent and the defendant, <em>State </em>v. <em>Smith, </em>286 Kan. 402, 184 P.3d 890, cert. denied, 555 U.S. 1062, 129 S. Ct. 628, 172 L. Ed. 2d 639 (2008), is facially on-point but, upon closer review, ultimately lacking in persuasive value. In <em>Smith, </em>the court concluded that <em>Muehler v. Mena, </em>supra, 100-101, does not \u201c[allow] law enforcement officers to expand the scope of a traffic stop to include a search not related to the purpose of the stop, even if a detainee has given permission for the search. Rather, we continue to adhere to our longstanding rule that consensual searches during the period of a detention for a traffic stop are invalid under the [fjourth [a]mendment . . . <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"276\">*276</page-number>and [the state constitution].\u201d<footnotemark>54</footnotemark> <em>State </em>v. <em>Smith, </em>supra, 419. <em>Smith </em>is unpersuasive because it lacks an independent state constitutional analysis. Moreover, as noted previously, the Kansas Supreme Court\u2019s more recent decision in <em>State </em>v. <em>Morlock, </em>supra, 289 Kan. 988, makes clear that, to the extent <em>Smith </em>is analyzing the <em>federal </em>constitution, it no longer is good law because <em>Arizona </em>v. <em>Johnson, </em>supra, 129 S. Ct. 787-88, \u201celiminated any doubt that the <em>Muehler </em>rationale applied to traffic stops.\u201d<footnotemark>55</footnotemark> See also footnote 28 of this opinion.</p>\n<p id=\"b297-4\"><page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"277\">*277</page-number>Finally, we find the Alaska Court of Appeals decision in <em>Brown </em>v. <em>State, </em>182 P.3d 624 (Alaska App. 2008), to lack persuasive value because of a significant internal inconsistency in the opinion. The Alaska court relied on a comprehensive survey of academic literature and existing case law; id., 630-32; in support of its determination that \u201cfederal law does not afford sufficient protection to motorists who are asked to consent to a search of their person, their vehicle, or their belongings during a traffic stop.\u201d<footnotemark>56</footnotemark> Id., 629. The court observed that, \u201cbecause most people need to travel by car, and <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"278\">*278</page-number>because of the near-inevitability that people will commit traffic infractions, the \u2018routine\u2019 traffic stop has become the doorway to widespread and probing searches of persons, vehicles, and luggage.\u201d Id., 631-32. The Alaska court then stated that \u201c[t]he facts of this case present an example of an apparently ongoing and unjustified infringement of the privacy rights of Alaska citizens. And, as we have explained here, it is uncertain whether the [fourth amendment] offers any remedy. We therefore conclude that [the Alaska state constitution] must be interpreted to grant broader protections than its federal counterpart in situations like this.\u201d Id., 633-34. Curiously, however, the Alaska court then backpedaled somewhat, and stated that, \u201cwe need not decide whether [the state constitution] should be interpreted to completely preclude requests for searches during a routine traffic stop unless the search is related to the ground for the stop or is otherwise supported by a reasonable suspicion of criminality. We leave that question for another day.\u201d Id., 634. The court then held simply that the record in <em>Brown </em>\u201cpresented] a particularly egregious example of this police practice\u201d because of the trooper\u2019s failure to inform the defendant of the reason for the stop or its disposition prior to requesting consent to search. Id. Justice Katz\u2019 attempts to salvage <em>Brown </em>notwithstanding, this limitation necessarily diminishes the persuasive value of the case in support of the defendant\u2019s request for a specific state constitutional rule in Connecticut. See also <em>Murphy </em>v. <em>Anchorage, </em>Alaska Court of Appeals, Docket No. A-10345, No. 5576, 2010 Alaska App. LEXIS 28, *11 (March 17, 2010) (memorandum opinion) (noting that defendant \u201cmisinteiprets <em>Brown </em>by asserting that we <em>did </em>adopt this general restriction on police authority during traffic stops\u201d [emphasis in original]); <em>Bostwick v.

Numerous commentators, in articles revealed by our independent research, support this assertion.<footnotemark>57</footnotemark> See, e.g., S. Chanenson, \u201cGet the Facts, Jack! Empirical Research and the Changing Constitutional Landscape of Consent Searches,\u201d 71 Tenn. L. Rev. 399, 451-52 (2004) (discussing study that showed that 89.3 percent of 9028 people studied granted consent to search during traffic stops in Maryland and Ohio); W.

With respect to the defendant\u2019s request for a state constitutional prophylactic rule requiring law enforcement officers to inform motorists of their right to refuse, endorsed by Justice Palmer in his dissent, even those commentators supporting that position have acknowledged, however, that warnings do not significantly reduce the rate of consent. See S. Chanenson, supra, 466 (likening warnings to \u201c \u2018chicken soup\u2019 \u201d in that they cannot hurt, could help); M. Phillips, note, \u201cEffective Warnings Before Consent Searches: Practical, Necessary, and Desirable,\u201d 45 Am. Crim. L.

We note specifically that the defendant\u2019s request for a rule requiring reasonable suspicion prior to seeking consent to search is supported by noted Professor Wayne R. LaFave.<footnotemark>58</footnotemark> See W. LaFave, supra, 102 Mich. L. Rev. 1893, citing <em>State </em>v. <em>Fort, </em>supra, 660 N.W.2d 415; see also 4 W.

We agree with the state and emphasize that the record does not contain <em>any </em>evidence whatsoever that Morgan\u2019s actions were racially motivated, or that the \u201cinsidious\u201d practice of racial profiling or other abusive conduct by the police; <em>State </em>v. <em>Donohue, </em>251 Conn. 636, 648 and n.11, 742 A.2d 775 (1999), cert. denied, 531 U.S. 924, 121 S.

Our own constitutional language, precedents and history do not support a ready departure from the federal case law in this area, particularly because the recent United States Supreme Court decisions do not represent a sea change from prior Connecticut precedent. See <em>State </em>v. <em>Oquendo, </em>supra, 223 Conn. 647-49. Moreover, the only relevant sister state constitutional decision that provides greater protection than the fourth amendment in this context, but is written persuasively, is <em>State </em>v. <em>Carty, </em>supra, 170 N.J. 632. That decision, however, is founded upon a factual predicate of local law enforcement abuses that simply does not exist on this record, disinclining us to follow it. See <em>State </em>v. <em>Snell, </em>supra, 323 Mont. 161 (declining to follow <em>Catty </em>because defendant \u201cdoes not argue \u2014 much less establish \u2014 that Montana law enforcement officers are abusing their authority\u201d); <em>Commonwealth </em>v. <em>Strickler, </em>supra, 563 Pa. 80-81 n.28 (declining to \u201ctake judicial notice that police employ tactics such as consent searches on a selective, discriminatory basis against members of protected classes, primarily on Pennsylvania interstate highways used as conduits by traffickers of illegal drugs\u201d and noting that \u201cthe assertion of such discriminatory conduct finds no support in the record of any of the consolidated cases\u201d); cf. <em>O\u2019Boyle </em>v. <em>State, </em><page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"283\">*283</page-number>supra, 117 P.3d 411-12 (adopting state constitutional reasonableness inquiry influenced by local factors).

After further testimony about the search of the Altima, Morgan testified during recross-examination, in response to a question from the defendant asking why Morgan had searched his person: \u201cI asked him if he had anything illegal on him and he said no, and I checked.\u201d Morgan then testified that he had not believed that the defendant was armed at the time.

At oral argument before this court, the state cited <em>Arizona </em>v. <em>Johnson, </em>supra, 129 S.

This is consistent with the well established general proposition that an automobile stop occasioned by a traffic violation is more akin to a <em>Terry </em>stop than a custodial arrest, and is, therefore, governed by <em>Terry </em>principles, even when the police officer has probable cause to believe that the motorist has violated a traffic law.

In <em>Jones, </em>after receiving word that the computer checks revealed that the defendants had clean records, the officer spent three minutes reiterating previously asked questions prior to asking for consent to search, despite the fact that the warning citation had been prepared and needed only the driver\u2019s signature for the stop to be complete. <em>United States </em>v. <em>Jones, </em>supra, 240-41.

Mindful of <em>Story, </em>if we now sanction arbitrary requests for consent searches by the police <em>prior </em>to the conclusion of a stop, we effectively close the door on a criminal defendant\u2019s ability ever to contest the validity of a consent to search during a motor vehicle stop.\u201d (Emphasis in original.) <em>State v.

We disagree with the Appellate Court\u2019s prediction, in that, <em>post-Arizona </em>v. <em>Johnson, </em>supra, 555 U.S. 331-33, a defendant still may challenge the overall duration of a traffic stop as unreasonable under the circumstances, as well as make an analytically separate claim with respect to the voluntariness of his consent to search.</p>\n</footnote>\n<footnote label=\"29\">\n<p id=\"b267-5\"> We note that several courts have held the timing of the questioning or requests for consent to have independent constitutional significance, and have emphasized that questioning <em>after </em>discrete events such as the issuance of a ticket or warning, or the return of a driver\u2019s paperwork, may create a detention distinct from the initial stop, which then would require independent justification such as consent or reasonable suspicion. Put differently, these courts conclude that the return of the paperwork marks the end of the initial traffic stop, and determining the consensual nature of the subsequent interaction requires analysis of whether the driver reasonably would have felt free to leave under <em>United States </em>v. <em>Mendenhall, </em>446 U.S. 544, 554, 100 S.

The dissent does not, however, point to any Connecticut case law definitively indicating that brief off-the-topic questioning, which does not measurably extend the length of the <em>Terry </em>detention, is per se unreasonable under our state constitution. Cf. <em>State </em>v. <em>Edwards, </em>supra, 73 (declining to \u201c[extend] a <em>Terry </em>stop to include transporting a suspect to a police station for open ended questioning\u201d).</p>\n</footnote>\n<footnote label=\"44\">\n<p id=\"b286-9\"><em> </em>The defendant cites <em>State v.

In <em>State </em>v. <em>Conger, </em>supra, 387, 391, this court concluded that the defendant, who sought to contest the legality of his stop while driving a stolen truck, had standing to raise a fourth amendment claim, because \u201c[t]he defendant, as an occupant of the truck, has an interest in continuing his travels without government intrusion. Thus his fourth amendment rights could have been violated by the stopping of the truck even though the truck was stolen.\u201d In our view, <em>Conger </em>does not support the defendant\u2019s argument because it does not consider the propriety of the traffic stop itself under either the federal or state constitutions.</p>\n</footnote>\n<footnote label=\"45\">\n<p id=\"b288-5\"> The defendant also relies on sister state case law interpreting the federal constitution, as well as some decisions applying state statutes restricting the scope of traffic stops. To the extent that the case law interprets the federal constitution, it, like those federal decisions preceding <em>Muehler </em>v. <em>Mena, </em>supra, 544 U.S. 93, <em>and Arizona </em>v. <em>Johnson, </em>supra, 555 U.S. 323, lacks current persuasive value for purposes of this <em>Geisler </em>analysis.

With respect to Montana, the defendant cites <em>State </em>v. <em>Hill, </em>322 Mont. 165, 94 P.3d 752 (2004). Putting aside the distinction that consent was sought after the trooper had acted to end the stop by returning the defendant\u2019s paperwork and telling him that \u201c \u2018we\u2019re done\u2019 id., 168; <em>Hill </em>does not hold that Montana\u2019s constitution provides motorists in that state with enhanced state constitutional protections. Id., 170; see also id., 174 (defendant lacks reasonable expectation of privacy in unlawfully possessed rental vehicle). Indeed, the Montana Supreme Court issued a decision subsequent to <em>Hill </em>holding to the contrary. See <em>State </em>v. <em>Snell, </em>323 Mont. 157, 161, 99 P.3d 191 (2004) (\u201cIt is undisputed that [the officer] had particularized suspicion to stop [the defendant\u2019s] vehicle.

In <em>Cunningham, </em>the court merely held unreasonable under the state constitution the detention, not supported by reasonable suspicion, of a motorist for forty-six minutes pending the arrival of a drug-sniffing dog, after the motorist had refused to give officers consent to search his car. Id., 405, 415-16; see also id., 415 n.6 (emphasizing that court did not adopt \u201cbright-line canine-response timing rule,\u201d and also that it did not need to consider vitality of <em>Illinois </em>v. <em>Caballes, </em>supra, 543 U.S. 409-10, under state constitution because, unlike in <em>Caballes, </em>arrival of drug-sniffing dog in <em>Cunningham </em>measurably prolonged duration of stop).</p>\n<p id=\"Avl\"><page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"269\">*269</page-number>Finally, the defendant relies on <em>State </em>v. <em>Glossbrener, </em>146 Wash. 2d 670, 49 P.3d 128 (2002), in support of the proposition that Washington has a state constitutional rule restricting the scope and duration of routine traffic stops to the initial purpose of the stop, in the absence of an independent basis of reasonable suspicion to justify further investigation. The defendant\u2019s reliance on <em>Glossbrener </em>is, however, misplaced; Washington does in fact have such a rule, but it is statutory, and not constitutional. Id., 676-77; see Wash. Rev.

In <em>Strickler, </em>the court concluded that the encounter in that case, which had occurred after the officer had returned the defendant\u2019s license to him, thanked him for his cooperation, and decided not to cite him for public urination on the side of the road; <em>Commonwealth </em>v. <em>Strickler, </em>supra, 53; was not itself a subsequent seizure despite the officer\u2019s failure to inform the defendant specifically that he was free to leave because, inter alia, the officer did not act coercively and had informed the defendant that he was not required to consent to the search. Id., 76-78. The court then applied a similar analysis to determine that the defendant\u2019s consent to the search was voluntary. Id., 79-80. Prior to performing these analyses, the court emphasized its adoption of \u201can interpretation of <em>[Robinette] </em>which allows for the possibility of a mere encounter following a traffic stop or similar detention . . . .\u201d Id., 72. The court noted, in dicta, that the Supreme Court\u2019s decision in <em>Robinette </em>reasonably could be read \u201cas deeming all circumstances connected with the overall encounter [therein] to reflect a single, albeit constitutionally-permissible detention,\u201d thus validating the request for consent to search in the Supreme Court case, which had been decided solely on voluntariness grounds.

For example, in <em>State </em>v. <em>Washington, </em>supra, 898 N.E.2d 1202-1203, the defendant claimed that a police officer had violated the fourth amendment and the Indiana constitution by questioning the defendant during a routine traffic stop about whether he had weapons or drugs on his person. After rejecting the defendant\u2019s federal constitutional claims; see id., 1205; the Indiana Supreme Court noted that \u201c[t]he determination of the reasonableness of a search and seizure under the Indiana [constitution turns \u2018on a balance of: 1) the degree of concern, suspicion, or knowledge that a violation has occurred, 2) the degree of intrusion the method of search or seizure imposes on the citizen\u2019s ordinary activities, and 3) the extent of law enforcement needs.\u2019 \u201d Id., 1206, quoting <em>Litchfield </em>v. <em>State, </em>824 N.E.2d 356, 361 (Ind. 2005). The court then applied those factors to conclude that the initial stop of the defendant was appropriate because the officer had observed the defendant commit multiple <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"274\">*274</page-number>traffic violations, \u201cthe degree of police intrusion was slight\u201d because the \u201cofficer merely asked the defendant a brief question, one that not only asked if he had drugs, but also if he had weapons or other items that may harm the officer,\u201d and the \u201cquestion to the defendant was consistent with the officer\u2019s concern for his own safety and law enforcement\u2019s responsibilities to deter crime, to intercept criminal activity, and to apprehend its perpetrators.\u201d <em>State </em>v. <em>Washington, </em>supra, 1206. Thus, the court concluded that \u201c[t]he officer\u2019s question whether the defendant held contraband on his person, notwithstanding the absence of reasonable suspicion, was not unreasonable under the totality of the circumstances and did not violate . . . the Indiana [constitution.\u201d Id., 1208.</p>\n<p id=\"b294-6\">Similarly, in <em>State </em>v. <em>McKinnon-Andrews, </em>151 N.H. 19, 25, 846 A.2d 1198 (2004), the New Hampshire Supreme Court adopted a tripartite test to determine whether the <em>Terry </em>scope requirement has been exceeded in the context of a traffic stop, and evaluated \u201cwhether: (1) the question is reasonably related to the initial justification for the stop; (2) the law enforcement officer had a reasonable articulable suspicion that would justify the question; and (3) in light of all the circumstances, the question impermissibly prolonged the detention or changed its fundamental nature.\u201d The court noted that, \u201c[i]f the question is reasonably related to the purpose of the stop, no [constitutional] violation occurs. If the question is not reasonably related to the purpose of the stop, we must consider whether the law enforcement officer had a reasonable, articulable suspicion that would justify the question. If the question is so justified, no [constitutional] violation occurs. In the absence of a reasonable connection to the purpose of the stop or a reasonable, articulable suspicion, we must consider whether in light of all the circumstances and common sense, the question impermissibly prolonged the detention or changed the fundamental nature of the stop.\u201d (Internal quotation marks omitted.)

Id., 179-80, 186. The court concluded that the totality of the circumstances test for determining the voluntariness of consent; see <em>Schneckloth </em>v. <em>Bustamonte, </em>supra, 412 U.S. 243; provided motorists with adequate protection under the state constitution, and rejected the defendant\u2019s request, founded on <em>State </em>v. <em>Carty, </em>supra, 170 N.J. 632, seeking state constitutional rules requiring the police to: (1) have reasonable suspicion of criminal activity in order to seek a motorist\u2019s consent to search; and (2) inform <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"275\">*275</page-number>motorists of their right to decline to consent to a search.

Ed. 2d 1115 (2007), the Tenth Circuit noted that the failure to return the driver\u2019s documents meant only that the officer\u2019s interaction with the driver and the defendant, his passenger, \u201cnever became consensual\u201d and \u201cwhen the questioning about drugs occurred, and [the defendant and the driver] consented to a search of their car, the traffic stop continued to be a detention, not a consensual encounter.\u201d The court then concluded that the District Court had properly denied the defendant\u2019s motion to suppress, because it determined that \u201cquestioning about drugs did not unreasonably extend the detention, and therefore did not violate the [\u00b6] ourth [ajmendment.\u201d Id., 759. Finally, in <em>United States </em>v. <em>Guerrero-Espinoza, </em>462 F.3d 1302, 1308 n.6 (10th Cir. 2006), which appears to be sui generis because of its facts, the court emphasized that <em>Mena </em>did not apply because the trooper already had ended the traffic stop by returning the driver\u2019s documents and speeding warning to him while they sat in the cruiser away from the defendant, a passenger in the stopped car. The court then concluded that, because the defendant was not aware that the stop was over since those events had taken place out of his presence, he would not have felt free to leave, thus rendering his consent involuntary.

Both the fourth amendment to the United States constitution and article first, \u00a7 7, of the Connecticut constitution protect individuals against unreasonable searches and seizures. In this case, it is undisputed that the initial stop of the defendant, Christopher Jenkins, for improperly changing lanes was reasonable and, therefore, valid under both of these provisions. See <em>State </em>v. <em>Jenkins, </em>104 Conn. App. 417, 427, 934 A.2d 281 (2007). The question before us is whether the subsequent consent search of the defendant\u2019s vehicle, conducted after Officer Michael Morgan, a detective with the Newington police department, had completed a check of the defendant\u2019s personal and vehicular information, asked the defendant to step out of the vehicle, frisked him and explained the ticket to him, also was reasonable. I do not contest the majority\u2019s conclusion in part II of its opinion that, under the weight of recent federal precedent, the scope of the traffic stop was not improper under the federal constitution. Such a development, however, clearly would constitute a <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"284\">*284</page-number>move toward a more restrictive view of the fourth amendment than previously had been established under federal law. I disagree, however, with the majority\u2019s conclusion in part III of its opinion that the conduct in the present case did not violate the Connecticut constitution solely because Morgan\u2019s request for consent to search the defendant\u2019s vehicle did not measurably extend the <em>duration </em>of the traffic stop.<footnotemark>1</footnotemark> In my view, under article first, \u00a7 7, of the Connecticut constitution, before a police officer can shift the purpose and scope of a roadside detention from a routine traffic stop to a consent search, the officer must have reasonable and articulable suspicion of illegal activity unrelated to the initial traffic violation.<footnotemark>2</footnotemark> Accordingly, I respectfully dissent.</p>\n<p id=\"b304-5\">\u201cIt is well established that federal constitutional . . . law establishes a minimum national standard for the exercise of individual rights and does not inhibit state governments from affording higher levels of protection for such rights. . . . <em>State </em>v. <em>Oquendo, </em>223 Conn. 635, 649, 613 A.2d 1300 (1992). Moreover, we have held that [i]n the area of fundamental civil liberties \u2014 which <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"285\">*285</page-number>includes all protections of the declaration of rights contained in article first of the Connecticut constitution\u2014 we sit as a court of last resort .... In such constitutional adjudication, our first referent is Connecticut law and the full panoply of rights Connecticut citizens have come to expect as their due. Accordingly, decisions of the United States Supreme Court defining fundamental rights are persuasive authority to be afforded respectful consideration, but they are to be followed by Connecticut courts only when they provide no less individual protection than is guaranteed by Connecticut law. . . . <em>State </em>v. <em>Marsala, </em>216 Conn. 150, 160, 579 A.2d 58 (1990). Recognizing that our state constitution is an instrument of progress ... is intended to stand for a great length of time and should not be interpreted too narrowly or too literally . . . we have concluded in several cases that the state constitution provides broader protection of individual rights than does the federal constitution. See, e.g., <em>[State </em>v. <em>Oquendo, </em>supra], 652; <em>State </em>v. <em>Marsala, </em>supra, 171; <em>State </em>v. <em>Dukes, </em>209 Conn. 98, 112, 547 A.2d 10 (1988), and cases cited therein.\u201d (Citation omitted; internal quotation marks omitted.) <em>State </em>v. <em>DeFusco, </em>224 Conn. 627, 632, 620 A.2d 746 (1993). \u201cSpecifically, we have held that article first, \u00a7 7, affords protections to the citizens of this state beyond those provided by the fourth amendment to the federal constitution, as that provision has been interpreted by the United States Supreme Court. See <em>State </em>v. <em>Miller, </em>227 Conn. 363, 379, 630 A.2d 1315 (1993); <em>State </em>v. <em>Geisler, </em>222 Conn. 672, 690, 610 A.2d 1225 (1992); <em>State </em>v. <em>Marsala, </em>supra, [160-61]; <em>State </em>v. <em>Dukes, </em>supra, [122-23].\u201d <em>State </em>v. <em>Wilkins, </em>240 Conn. 489, 504-505, 692 A.2d 1233 (1997).</p>\n<p id=\"b305-5\">\u201cThe analytical framework by which we determine whether, in any given instance, our state constitution affords broader protection to our citizens than the federal constitutional minimum is well settled. In <em>State </em>v. <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"286\">*286</page-number><em>Geisler, </em>[supra, 222 Conn. 684-86], we enumerated the following six factors to be considered in determining that issue: (1) persuasive relevant federal precedents; (2) the text of the operative constitutional provisions; (3) historical insights into the intent of our constitutional forebears; (4) related Connecticut precedents; (5) persuasive precedents of other state courts; and (6) contemporary understandings of applicable economic and sociological norms, or as otherwise described, relevant public policies.\u201d (Internal quotation marks omitted.) <em>State </em>v. <em>McKenzie-Adams, </em>281 Conn. 486, 509-10, 915 A.2d 822, cert. denied, 552 U.S. 888, 128 S. Ct. 248, 169 L. Ed. 2d 148 (2007).</p>\n<p id=\"b306-7\">I agree with the majority that neither the text nor the constitutional history of article first, \u00a7 7, support the defendant\u2019s claim to greater protections under the state constitution than the federal constitution. I disagree, however, with the majority\u2019s analyses of persuasive relevant federal precedents, related Connecticut precedents, the persuasive precedents of other state courts and contemporary understandings of public policy. I believe that these four factors necessitate a conclusion that article first, \u00a7 7, requires us to examine both the temporal and <em>substantive </em>scope of a routine traffic stop and that, more specifically, a consent search during a routine traffic stop is not valid unless there is a reasonable and articulable suspicion to believe that a detained driver or passenger has engaged in, or is about to engage in, criminal activity.</p>\n<p id=\"b306-8\">I</p>\n<p id=\"b306-9\">FEDERAL PRECEDENTS</p>\n<p id=\"b306-10\">As I previously have noted herein, I do not dispute the majority\u2019s conclusion that recent federal precedent suggests that the permissibility of a consent search following a routine traffic stop is dictated by the duration of the stop. For the reasons that follow, however, it <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"287\">*287</page-number>is my view that such a holding constitutes a substantive departure from settled fourth amendment jurisprudence.</p>\n<p id=\"b307-5\">As both the majority and the state properly recognize, the reasonableness of traffic stops under the fourth amendment is analyzed under the framework established in <em>Terry </em>v. <em>Ohio, </em>392 U.S. 1, 88 S. Ct. 1868, 20 L. Ed. 2d 889 (1968). See <em>Arizona </em>v. <em>Johnson, </em>555 U.S. 323, 330, 129 S. Ct. 781, 172 L. Ed. 2d 694 (2009); <em>State </em>v. <em>Wilkins, </em>supra, 240 Conn. 508-509. Under <em>Terry, </em>\u201c[c]ertain seizures are reasonable under the fourth amendment even in the absence of probable cause if there is a reasonable and articulable suspicion that a person has committed or is about to commit a crime. <em>Florida </em>v. <em>Royer, </em>460 U.S. 491, 498, 103 S. Ct. 1319, 75 L. Ed. 2d 229 (1983); <em>Terry </em>v. <em>Ohio, </em>[supra, 24] ... . When a reasonable and articulable suspicion exists, the detaining officer may conduct an investigative stop of the suspect in order to confirm or dispel his suspicions.\u201d (Internal quotation marks omitted.) <em>State </em>v. <em>Brown, </em>279 Conn. 493, 517, 903 A.2d 169 (2006).</p>\n<p id=\"b307-6\">The United States Supreme Court had been careful, however, to limit the boundaries of such warrantless stops. The court acknowledged that it had \u201cheld in the past that a search which is reasonable at its inception may violate the [f]ourth [a]mendment by virtue of its intolerable intensity and scope. . . . The scope of the search must be strictly tied to and justified by the circumstances which rendered its initiation permissible.\u201d (Citations omitted; internal quotation marks omitted.) <em>Terry </em>v. <em>Ohio, </em>supra, 392 U.S. 17-19. Although the court declined to set out bright-line limitations on the scope of the search, it warned that \u201c[t]he manner in which the seizure and search were conducted is, of course, as vital a part of the inquiry as whether they were warranted at all. The [f]ourth [a]mendment proceeds as much by limitations upon the scope of governmental <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"288\">*288</page-number>action as by imposing preconditions upon its initiation. . . . The entire deterrent purpose of the rule excluding evidence seized in violation of the [f]ourth [a]mendment rests on the assumption that limitations upon the fruit to be gathered tend to limit the quest itself.\u201d (Citation omitted; internal quotation marks omitted.) Id., 28-29. Subsequently, in <em>Florida </em>v. <em>Royer, </em>supra, 460 U.S. 500, the court clarified that \u201c[t]he scope of [an investigative] detention must be carefully tailored to its underlying justification . . . [and the] investigative detention must be temporary and last no longer than is necessary to effectuate the purpose of the stop.\u201d</p>\n<p id=\"b308-5\">Drawing from the scope analyses set forth in <em>Terry </em>and <em>Royer, </em>several federal courts had required that routine traffic stops, justified under <em>Terry, </em>be reasonable in both duration <em>and manner. </em>See, e.g., <em>United States </em>v. <em>Boyce, </em>351 F.3d 1102, 1111 (11th Cir. 2003) (\u201c[T]here are two possible tests for when a police investigation exceeds the scope of a routine traffic stop. . . . The first test comes from the Tenth Circuit and limits the questions a police officer may ask to those questions that are justified by reasonable suspicion of criminal activity or reasonable safety concerns. . . . The second test comes from the Fifth Circuit and holds that questions unrelated to the reason for the initial stop are only unlawful if they extend the duration of the initial seizure.\u201d [Citations omitted.]); <em>United States </em>v. <em>Holt, </em>229 F.3d 931, 935 (10th Cir. 2000) (\u201cthe [United States] Supreme Court has indicated that although the permissible scope of an investigatory detention depends on the particular facts and circumstances of each case, it must in any case last no longer than is necessary to effectuate the purpose of the stop <em>and be carefully tailored to its underlying justification\u201d </em>[emphasis added; internal quotation marks omitted]). Accordingly, these courts had required that, during a routine traffic stop, an \u201cofficer\u2019s actions must be reason<page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"289\">*289</page-number>ably related in scope to the circumstances which justified the interference in the first place. . . . The traffic stop may be expanded beyond its original purpose . . . if during the initial stop the detaining officer acquires reasonable suspicion of criminal activity, that is to say the officer must acquire a particularized and objective basis for suspecting the particular person stopped of criminal activity.\u201d (Citations omitted; internal quotation marks omitted.) <em>United States </em>v. <em>Clarkson, </em>551 F.3d 1196, 1201 (10th Cir. 2009); see also <em>United States </em>v. <em>Henderson, </em>463 F.3d 27, 46 (1st Cir. 2006) (concluding that traffic stop exceeded bounds of <em>Terry </em>stop because officer\u2019s \u201cdemand for [the defendant\u2019s] identifying information and his subsequent investigation of [the defendant] expanded the scope of the stop, changed the target of the stop, and prolonged the stop\u201d); <em>United States </em>v. <em>Mix, </em>630 F. Sup. 2d 145, 156 (D. Mass. 2009) (The District Court cited First Circuit cases that analyzed the scope of traffic stops and concluded that they \u201csuggest a functional standard as well as a temporal one: What degree of intrusiveness and what duration was justified by the rationale for the stop?\u201d).</p>\n<p id=\"b309-5\">The United States Supreme Court recently seemed to refute this reasonableness in manner approach in <em>Arizona </em>v. <em>Johnson, </em>supra, 555 U.S. 332-34, wherein it addressed whether police questioning of a detained motorist during a traffic stop had exceeded the scope of the initial detention. Ultimately, the court stated a broad, unqualified conclusion that \u201c[a]n officer\u2019s inquiries into matters unrelated to the justification for the traffic stop ... do not convert the encounter into something other than a lawful seizure, so long as those inquiries do not measurably extend the duration of the stop.\u201d Id., 333. In reaching this conclusion, the court relied heavily on its prior decision in <em>Muehler </em>v. <em>Mena, </em>544 U.S. 93, 96, 125 S. Ct. 1465, 161 L. Ed. 2d 299 (2005), which in turn had relied on <em>Illinois </em>v. <em>Caballes, </em>543 <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"290\">*290</page-number>U.S. 405, 407, 125 S. Ct. 834, 160 L. Ed. 2d 842 (2005), neither of which involved <em>Terry </em>stops, or searches that were independent of the underlying justifications. See <em>Arizona </em>v. <em>Johnson, </em>supra, 333-34; <em>Muehler </em>v. <em>Mena, </em>supra, 101.<footnotemark>3</footnotemark></p>\n<p id=\"b310-5\">The majority reads this recent jurisprudence as dictating that the requirement of reasonableness in <em>Terry </em>is satisfied as long as the duration of a routine traffic stop is not unreasonably extended. This conclusion, if correct; see footnote 3 of this dissenting opinion; indicates that the United States Supreme Court has <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"291\">*291</page-number>departed significantly from its prior jurisprudence requiring <em>Terry </em>stops to be both substantively and temporally reasonable. I find the reasoning of <em>Royer </em>and the federal cases applying <em>Royer </em>to be persuasive because they best effectuate the scope limitation originally established in <em>Terry, </em>and consistently followed by this court. Accordingly, I believe that a more exacting analysis of the scope of a <em>Terry </em>stop than the purely temporal approach endorsed by the majority is required under the Connecticut constitution. Indeed, it is precisely in situations in which the United States Supreme Court has eschewed precedents protective of individual rights in favor of more permissive approaches that this court has found that the Connecticut constitution requires adherence to the earlier, more protective doctrines. See <em>State </em>v. <em>Linares, </em>232 Conn. 345, 382-83, 655 A.2d 737 (1995) (rejecting modem \u201cpublic forum\u201d analysis established by United States Supreme Court in favor of traditional case-by-case balancing approach); <em>State </em>v. <em>Marsala, </em>supra, 216 Conn. 171 (rejecting good faith exception to exclusionary rule adopted by United States Supreme Court); <em>State </em>v. <em>Dukes, </em>supra, 209 Conn. 120 (disavowing <em>United States </em>v. <em>Robinson, </em>414 U.S. 218, 234-35, 94 S. Ct. 467, 38 L. Ed. 2d 427 [1973], which allowed suspicionless full body searches in situations beyond full custodial arrest).</p>\n<p id=\"b311-5\">II</p>\n<p id=\"b311-6\">CONNECTICUT PRECEDENTS</p>\n<p id=\"b311-7\">A review of this court\u2019s precedents indicates that we never before have adopted the broadly permissive approach to the scope of <em>Terry </em>stops, including routine traffic stops, championed by the state and suggested by the United States Supreme Court\u2019s recent decisions. This court consistently has concluded that, under our state constitution, a <em>Terry </em>stop must be both justified at inception and reasonably circumscribed. See <em>State </em><page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"292\">*292</page-number>v. Wilkins, supra, 240 Conn. 507 (\u201c[a]rticle first, \u00a7\u00a7 7 and 9, of our state constitution permit a police officer in appropriate circumstances <em>and in an appropriate manner </em>to detain an individual for investigative purposes even though there is no probable cause to make an arrest\u201d [emphasis added]); <em>State </em>v. Lamme, 216 Conn. 172, 184, 579 A.2d 484 (1990) (\u201ccircumscribed nature\u201d of <em>Terry </em>stop minimizes risk of due process violation under Connecticut constitution); <em>State </em>v. <em>Edwards, </em>214 Conn. 57, 72, 570 A.2d 193 (1990) (\u201c[a] <em>Terry </em>stop that is justified at its inception can become constitutionally infirm if it lasts longer or becomes more intrusive than necessary to complete the investigation for which that stop was made\u201d [internal quotation marks omitted]); <em>State </em>v. <em>Carter, </em>189 Conn. 611, 618, 458 A.2d 369 (1983) (\u201cThe results of the initial stop may arouse further suspicion or may dispel the questions in the officer\u2019s mind. If the latter is the case, the stop may go no further and the detained individual must be free to go. If, on the contrary, the officer\u2019s suspicions are confirmed or are further aroused, the stop may be prolonged and the scope enlarged <em>as required by the </em>circumstances.\u201d [Emphasis added; internal quotation marks omitted.]). This court never has adopted the purely temporal analysis set forth in <em>Caballes, Muehler </em>and <em>Johnson, </em>and, in fact, has yet to cite to these cases. Therefore, our precedents weigh in favor of a more exacting analysis of the scope of a <em>Terry </em>stop than the purely temporal approach endorsed by the majority.</p>\n<p id=\"b312-5\">Our jurisprudence also supports the specific rule that the defendant asks us to adopt \u2014 that an officer conducting a routine traffic stop must have a reasonable and articulable suspicion of criminal activity unrelated to the initial traffic stop before asking for consent to search a vehicle. This court has required that a <em>Terry </em>stop be grounded upon \u201creasonable and articulable suspicion that the individual has committed or is about to <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"293\">*293</page-number>commit a crime\u201d; (internal quotation marks omitted) <em>State </em>v. <em>Nash, </em>278 Conn. 620, 632, 899 A.2d 1 (2006); while a <em>Terry </em>frisk requires that the officer has \u201ca reasonable and articulable suspicion that a suspect is armed and dangerous before [he] may commence a protective patdown search during an investigative stop.\u201d Id., 633. Indeed, we have cautioned that, \u201c[b]efore [a police officer] places a hand on the person of a citizen in search of anything, he must have constitutionally adequate, reasonable grounds for doing so. In the case of the self-protective search for weapons, he must be able to point to particular facts from which he reasonably inferred that the individual was armed and dangerous.\u201d (Internal quotation marks omitted.) Id., 631. Like the transition from a <em>Terry </em>stop to a <em>Terry </em>frisk, the transition from a routine traffic stop to a consent search involves a shift in purpose and procedure. As such, our precedents suggest this shift must be grounded in reasonable suspicion relevant to the police encounter\u2019s new direction, namely, reasonable and articulable suspicion of criminal activity unrelated to the initial routine traffic violation.</p>\n<p id=\"b313-5\">Ill</p>\n<p id=\"b313-6\">SISTER STATE PRECEDENTS</p>\n<p id=\"b313-7\">State courts have taken widely varying approaches to the proper analysis of the scope of a routine traffic stop. Some states either have expressly adopted the purely durational test under their state constitutions or have held that their state constitutions provide no greater rights than the federal constitution.<footnotemark>4</footnotemark> Others have <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"294\">*294</page-number>determined that their constitutions require, generally, a more exacting analysis of the scope of routine traffic stops and therefore require such stops to be substantively reasonable under the circumstances.<footnotemark>5</footnotemark> A significant group of states has distinguished between <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"295\">*295</page-number>acceptable investigatory techniques during a routine traffic stop and such techniques once the purpose of that traffic stop has been effectuated. Within this group, some states have, by statute, required a reasonable suspicion before consent searches may be undertaken after the purposes of the traffic stop have been effectuated.<footnotemark>6</footnotemark> <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"296\">*296</page-number>Others have applied the same standard based on state or federal constitutional provisions.<footnotemark>7</footnotemark> More importantly, <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"297\">*297</page-number>a persuasive minority has adopted the rule the defendant urges us to apply: that consent searches undertaken anytime during the course of a routine traffic violation be justified by reasonable and articulable suspicion of criminal activity independent of the initial traffic violation.</p>\n<p id=\"b317-5\">I begin with the several cases in which state courts have drawn from both federal and state constitutional provisions in limiting the scope of roadside traffic stops and requiring a reasonable and articulable suspicion of criminal activity unrelated to the initial stop before a police officer validly can ask for consent during a roadside search. In <em>State </em>v. <em>Smith </em>286 Kan. 402, 419, 184 P.3d 890, cert. denied, 555 U.S. 1062, 129 S. Ct. 628, 172 L. Ed. 2d 639 (2008), the Kansas Supreme Court held <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"298\">*298</page-number>that \u201cwe continue to adhere to our longstanding rule that consensual searches [unrelated to the grounds for a traffic stop] during the period of a detention for a traffic stop are invalid under the [f]ourth [a]mendment to the United States [constitution and \u00a7 15 of the Kansas [constitution [b]ill of [r]ights.\u201d<footnotemark>8</footnotemark> In <em>Commonwealth </em>v. <em>Strickler, </em>563 Pa. 47, 69, 757 A.2d 884 (2000), the Pennsylvania Supreme Court, noted that \u201c[a]rticle I, \u00a7 8 of the Pennsylvania [constitution . . . would not sustain a consent search conducted in the context of, but which is wholly unrelated in its scope to, an ongoing detention, since there can be no constitutionally-valid detention independently or following a traffic or similar stop absent reasonable suspicion, see, e.g., <em>Commonwealth </em>v. Melendez, 544 Pa. 323, 329, [676 A. 2d 226] (1996), and the scope of a detention is circumscribed by the reasons that justify it.\u201d It is true that, for the purposes of the <em>Geisler </em>analysis, we are concerned only with sister state precedents relevant to the question of whether state constitutions afford more protections than the federal constitution. Each of these courts, however, expressly cited to the search and seizure provisions of its own state constitution and before framing its ultimate conclusion based on both state and federal constitutional provisions. Thus, although I recognize the limitation on the previously discussed precedents, <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"299\">*299</page-number>I am nonetheless persuaded by their reasoning that the scope of a routine traffic stop should not be measured merely by its duration.</p>\n<p id=\"b319-5\">I next turn to the New Jersey Supreme Court\u2019s holding in <em>State </em>v. <em>Carty, </em>170 N.J. 632, 790 A.2d 903 (2002). In that case, the court analyzed whether evidence discovered during a roadside consent search was admissible when the state trooper had requested consent without having an articulable suspicion of any criminal activity besides an initial speeding violation. The court first determined that \u201c[r]oadside consent searches are . . . more akin to an investigatory stop that does involve a detention. Such a stop traditionally has required reasonable and articulable suspicion.\u201d Id., 640. The court then held that a consent search during a lawful motor vehicle stop is valid only if there is a \u201creasonable and articulable suspicion to believe that an errant motorist or passenger has engaged in, or is about to engage in, criminal activity.\u201d Id., 647. The court explained that \u201c[t]he requirement of reasonable and articulable suspicion is derived from our [s]tate [constitution<footnotemark>9</footnotemark> and serves to validate the continued detention associated with the search. It also serves the prophylactic purpose of preventing the police from turning \u00e1 routine traffic stop into a fishing expedition for criminal activity unrelated to the stop.\u201d Id.</p>\n<p id=\"b319-6\">I agree with the majority that <em>Carty </em>differs from the present case on three grounds: (1) the New Jersey Supreme Court consistently has afforded a higher level of scrutiny to consent searches than does the United States Supreme Court; (2) the New Jersey police were <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"300\">*300</page-number>subject to both a federal decree and state police policy Umiting coercive investigatory techniques; and (3) the court had before it an extensive factual record demonstrating the violation of the federal decree and state police policy. Despite these distinctions, however, there are several reasons why <em>Carty </em>is relevant and persuasive. First, although this court has not afforded greater protections than the federal courts concerning consent searches <em>specifically, </em>this court also has found that the Connecticut constitution provides greater protection against official searches and seizures, <em>generally. </em>See <em>State </em>v. <em>Wilkins, </em>supra, 240 Conn. 504\u2014505; <em>State </em>v. <em>Miller, </em>supra, 227 Conn. 379-80; <em>State </em>v. <em>Geisler, </em>supra, 222 Conn. 690; <em>State </em>v. <em>Marsala, </em>supra, 216 Conn. 159-60; <em>State </em>v. <em>Dukes, </em>supra, 209 Conn. 122-23. Second, although the New Jersey Supreme Court notes that its holding is consistent with the consent decree and state police policy limiting coercive investigatory techniques, it does not rely exclusively upon them. <em>State </em>v. <em>Carty, </em>supra, 170 N.J. 647. Finally, much of the data before the court merely corroborated significant legal scholarship, of which we may take judicial notice,<footnotemark>10</footnotemark> demonstrating the psychological pressure faced by detained motorists and the ways in which that pressure may be manipulated to obtain consent to search. Id., 644-45. Indeed, the court\u2019s analysis emphasized the universal impact of consent searches, observing that \u201c[m]any persons, perhaps most, would view the request of a police officer to make a search as having the force of law. ... In the context of motor vehicle stops, where the individual is at the side of the road and confronted by a uniformed officer seeking to search his or her vehicle, it is not a stretch of the imagination to assume that the individual feels compelled to consent.\u201d (Citation omitted; internal quotation marks omitted.) <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"301\">*301</page-number>Id., 644. I therefore find the New Jersey Supreme Court\u2019s well reasoned and thorough opinion to have significant persuasive weight within the context of the <em>Geisler </em>analysis.</p>\n<p id=\"b321-5\">I also find persuasive the Minnesota Supreme Court\u2019s decision requiring that officers have reasonable and articulable suspicion of criminal activity independent of the initial traffic violation before asking for consent to search during a traffic stop. See <em>State </em>v. <em>Fort, </em>660 N.W.2d 415, 418-19 (Minn. 2003). Therein, the court noted that \u201cthe scope and duration of a traffic stop investigation must be limited to the justification for the stop.\u201d Id., 418. It relied on an earlier case, <em>State </em>v. <em>Wiegand, </em>645 N.W.2d 125, 135 (Minn. 2002), for support. The court explained: \u201cIn <em>Wiegand, </em>the defendants were stopped for a bumed-out headlight, but the police conducted a search using a narcotics-detection dog in the absence of reasonable articulable suspicion of drug-related activity. [Id., 128-29, 137]. We reversed the defendants\u2019 convictions holding, among other things, that under [a]rticle [first], [\u00a7] 10, of the Minnesota [constitution any expansion of the scope or duration of a traffic stop must be justified by a reasonable articulable suspicion of other criminal activity. [Id., 135].\u201d <em>State </em>v. <em>Fort, </em>supra, 418-19. Under this framework, although the initial traffic stop was proper, \u201cthe investigative questioning, consent inquiry, and subsequent search went beyond the scope of the traffic stop and was unsupported by any reasonable articulable suspicion.\u201d Id., 419. Accordingly, the court affirmed the trial court\u2019s order suppressing evidence discovered during the consent search.<footnotemark>11</footnotemark></p>\n<p id=\"b322-4\"><page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"302\">*302</page-number>Similarly, the Court of Appeals of Alaska recently held that \u201can officer\u2019s questions about other potential crimes, and an officer\u2019s requests for permission to conduct a search, are significant events under the search and seizure provision of the Alaska [c]onstitution, [article first, \u00a7 14]. More specifically, we conclude that, under the circumstances presented in this case, the officer conducting the traffic stop was prohibited from requesting [the defendant\u2019s] permission to conduct a search that was (1) unrelated to the basis for the stop and (2) not otherwise supported by a reasonable suspicion of criminality.\u201d <em>Brown </em>v. <em>State, </em>182 P.3d 624, 626 (Alaska App. 2008). In reaching this conclusion, the court acknowledged that federal precedents, including <em>Muehler </em>v. <em>Mena, </em>supra, 544 U.S. 93, did not prevent the officer from engaging in a consent search completely unrelated to the initial traffic stop. <em>Brown </em>v. <em>State, </em>supra, 629 (\u201cwe conclude that federal law does not afford sufficient protection to motorists who are asked to consent to a search of their person, their vehicle, or their belongings during a traffic stop\u201d). The court noted, however, that the Alaska Supreme Court and Court of Appeals repeatedly had interpreted article first, \u00a7 14, of that state\u2019s constitution to provide greater protection to the citizens of Alaska than that provided by the fourth amendment to the federal constitution. Id., 633. Drawing from state search and seizure jurisprudence interpreting the Alaska constitution, as well as public policy concerns and sister state precedent, the court concluded that the Alaska constitution \u201cmust be interpreted to grant broader protections than its federal counterpart\u201d in situations involving consent searches during routine traffic stops.<footnotemark>12</footnotemark> Id., 634.</p>\n<p id=\"b323-4\"><page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"303\">*303</page-number>IV</p>\n<p id=\"b323-5\">RELEVANT PUBLIC POLICY</p>\n<p id=\"b323-6\">Routine requests to search a detained motorist, in the absence of any suspicion of criminal activity beyond an initial traffic violation, represent a real and disturbing burden on motorists<footnotemark>13</footnotemark> and a substantial breach <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"304\">*304</page-number>of privacy. See <em>Ohio </em>v. <em>Robinette, </em>519 U.S. 33, 48, 117 S. Ct. 417, 136 L.

Although, ostensibly, a driver in this situation may refuse consent, most detained motorists will feel compelled to grant permission to search their vehicles, regardless of whether they in fact are carrying contraband. See 4 W. LaFave, Search and Seizure (4th Ed. 2004) \u00a7 9.3 (e), p. 395 and notes; <em>Brown </em>v. <em>State, </em>supra, 630 (listing studies demonstrating that \u201cthe vast majority of motorists who are subjected to this type of request will accede to the officer and allow the search\u201d); <em>State </em>v. <em>Carty, </em>supra, 170 N.J. 644-45 (noting that \u201c[i]n the context of motor vehicle stops, where the individual is at the side of the road and confronted by a uniformed officer seeking to search his or her vehicle, it is not a stretch of the imagination to assume that the individual feels compelled to consent\u201d and listing studies indicating that nearly 95 percent of detained motorists granted consent to search). Recognizing these concerns, many states have enacted statutory provisions protecting motorists detained because of a routine traffic violation from consent searches except when the circumstances evidence criminal activity independent of the traffic violation. See footnote 6 of this dissenting opinion.</p>\n<p id=\"b325-5\">Although we have no specific data evidencing the frequency of consent searches during routine traffic stops in Connecticut, the fact that so many people must drive in order to fulfill their daily work, family and educational needs means that many Connecticut citizens may be subject to requests for consent searches and the significant interruption that such searches entail. See <em>Brown </em>v. <em>State, </em>supra, 182 P.3d 631-32 (\u201cbecause most people need to travel by car, and because of the near-inevitability that people will commit traffic infractions, the \u2018routine\u2019 traffic stop has become the doorway to widespread and probing searches of persons, vehicles, and luggage\u201d). Moreover, research suggests that these searches have in fact become more <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"306\">*306</page-number>frequent, in part because of the dual wars on drugs and terrorism. See <em>Brown </em>v. <em>State, </em>supra, 629 (listing \u201c[c]ases from other states [that] show that this police practice is not an isolated phenomenon\u201d); 4 W. LaFave, supra, p. 395 (\u201c[Requesting consent has apparently become yet another part of the \u2018routine\u2019 of \u2018routine traffic stops\u2019 \u201d); S.

I therefore conclude that there are strong public policy arguments weighing in favor of limiting consent searches undertaken during routine traffic stops.</p>\n<p id=\"b326-5\">V</p>\n<p id=\"b326-6\">CONCLUSION</p>\n<p id=\"b326-7\">Having reviewed the relevant <em>Geisler </em>factors, I conclude that article first, \u00a7 7, of the Connecticut constitution provides greater protection than the federal constitution with respect to consent searches during routine traffic stops in that it requires that the scope of a <em>Terry </em>stop be reasonable both in substance and duration. This conclusion is supported by this court\u2019s long emphasis on the overall reasonableness of <em>Terry </em>searches, especially in light of the uncertain and conflicting dictates of federal law, as well as persuasive sister state precedents and contemporary public policy concerns. In order to effectuate the requirement that <em>Terry </em>stops be both substantively and temporally reasonable in scope, I further conclude that a consent search during<footnotemark>14</footnotemark> a routine traffic stop is not valid unless <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"307\">*307</page-number>there is a reasonable and articulable suspicion to believe that a detained driver or passenger has engaged in, or is about to engage in, criminal activity.</p>\n<p id=\"b327-5\">In determining whether reasonable and articulable suspicion exists, \u201ca court must consider if, relying on the whole picture, the detaining officers had a particularized and objective basis for suspecting the particular person stopped of criminal activity. ... [A] court must examine the specific information available to the police officer at the time of the initial intrusion and any rational inferences to be derived therefrom.\u201d (Internal quotation marks omitted.) <em>State </em>v. <em>Batts, </em>281 Conn. 682, 691-92, 916 A.2d 788, cert. denied, 552 U.S. 1048, 128 S. Ct. 667, 169 L. Ed. 2d 524 (2007). Although a trial court\u2019s findings of facts in connection with a suppression hearing are entitled to deference, the determination of whether reasonable and articulable suspicion existed is a question of law, subject to plenary review. See <em>State </em>v. <em>Brown, </em>supra, 279 Conn. 516 (\u201cThe defendant challenges not the trial court\u2019s factual findings but, rather, its legal conclusions that the actions of the police constitutionally were valid. These conclusions are subject to plenary review.\u201d).</p>\n<p id=\"b327-6\">In the present case, the Appellate Court thoroughly reviewed the circumstances surrounding the stop and <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"308\">*308</page-number>concluded as a matter of law that the state \u201cdid not establish that [Officer] Morgan had reasonable suspicion to expand the scope of the stop into an inquiry of whether the defendant was engaged in illegal activity unrelated to the underlying stop or that Morgan was proceeding on anything more than a mere hunch.\u201d <em>State </em>v. <em>Jenkins, </em>supra, 104 Conn. App. 434. My own review of the record leads me to the same conclusion. Accordingly, I conclude that the consent search was invalid under article first, \u00a7 7, of the Connecticut constitution. Therefore, I respectfully dissent from the majority\u2019s decision reversing the judgment of the Appellate Court.</p>\n<footnote label=\"1\">\n<p id=\"b304-6\"> I agree with the majority\u2019s conclusion in part I of its opinion that, because the defendant failed to create an adequate record before the trial court regarding the validity of the patdown search, the Appellate Court improperly considered that conduct in analyzing the defendant\u2019s claims regarding the vehicle search, other than as a historical fact.</p>\n</footnote>\n<footnote label=\"2\">\n<p id=\"b304-7\"> In addition to asking the court to adopt this standard under the state constitution, the defendant requests that this court adopt the following rules: (1) an officer conducting a routine traffic stop that has not elevated into a justifiable investigatory stop must inform the motorist that he is free to leave and free to refuse consent to search as a prerequisite to obtaining consent after the traffic stop has ended; (2) the state must show that any exchange between an officer and a motorist clearly and unambiguously supports the conclusion that the motorist actually consented to the search performed; and (3) the state should be held to a higher standard of proof for consent searches that occur during routine, noncriminal traffic stops. The defendant has offered no analysis directly addressing these claims or any case law that would tend to support them. I therefore decline to address them.</p>\n</footnote>\n<footnote label=\"3\">\n<p id=\"b310-6\"> In <em>Muehler </em>v. <em>Mena, </em>supra, 544 U.S. 101, the court noted: \u201cOur recent opinion in <em>Illinois </em>v. <em>Caballes, </em>[supra, 543 U.S. 405], is instructive. There, we held that a dog sniff performed during a traffic stop does not violate the [\u00b6] ourth [a]mendment. We noted that a lawful seizure can become unlawful if it is prolonged beyond the time reasonably required to complete that mission, but accepted the state court\u2019s determination that the duration of the stop was not extended by the dog sniff. . . . Because we held that a dog sniff was not a search subject to the [fjourth [ajmendment, we rejected the notion that the shift in purpose from a lawful traffic stop into a drug investigation was unlawful because it was not supported by any reasonable suspicion. . . . Likewise here, the initial . . . detention was lawful; the Court of Appeals did not find that the questioning extended the time [the defendant] was detained. Thus no additional [fjourth [ajmendment justification for inquiring about [the defendant\u2019s] immigration status was required.\u201d (Citations omitted; internal quotation marks omitted.)</p>\n<p id=\"b310-8\">Because neither <em>Muehler </em>nor <em>Caballes </em>involved a separate search under the fourth amendment, the United States Supreme Court cases relied on by the state and the majority do not squarely address the proper analysis of a shift in purpose between a lawful <em>Terry </em>stop and a consent search. Nonetheless, because I recognize that the weight of federal precedent after <em>Arizona </em>v. <em>Johnson, </em>supra, 555 U.S. 333-34, tends toward applying apurely durational analysis to both police inquiries and requests for consent made within a routine traffic stop; see <em>United States </em>v. <em>Everett, </em>601 F.3d 484, 489-90 (6th Cir. 2010); <em>United States </em>v. <em>Taylor, </em>596 F.3d 373, 375-76 (7th Cir. 2010); <em>United States </em>v. <em>Rivera, </em>570 F.3d 1009, 1013-15 (8th Cir. 2009); <em>United States </em>v. <em>Cousin, </em>United States District Court, Docket No.1:09-CR-89, 2010 U.S. Dist.

In the present case, Officer Morgan retained the defendant\u2019s license and paperwork while he asked him to step out of the car, frisked him, and asked for consent to search the car.

Moreover, this approach vests police with the power to determine, by either prolonging or expediting the requirements of the routine traffic stop, when additional justification is needed. Therefore, I adopt the reasoning articulated by the New Jersey Supreme Court: \u201cA suspicionless consent search shall be deemed unconstitutional whether it preceded or followed completion of the lawful traffic stop.\u201d <em>State </em>v.

The majority concludes that Detective Michael Morgan of the Newington police department did not violate the rights of the defendant, Christopher Jenkins, under article first, \u00a7 7, of the Connecticut constitution when Morgan conducted a consent search of the defendant\u2019s vehicle following his lawful stop of the defendant for a traffic violation in Newington at approximately 11:30 p.m. on May 7, 2004. I disagree with the majority\u2019s conclusion because I believe that, under the state constitution, Morgan was required to inform the defendant that he had no obligation to consent to the search of his vehicle and that he was free to leave, once he received the traffic ticket, if he chose to withhold consent to search.<footnotemark>1</footnotemark> I reach this conclusion for two interrelated reasons. First, such an advisement is necessary to ensure that a waiver of the constitutionally protected right to refuse consent to a vehicle search following a routine traffic stop has been given freely and intelligently. Second, without that advisement, there exists too great of a risk that the <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"309\">*309</page-number>person being detained in connection with the traffic stop, who may not leave the scene until permitted to do so by the police, will feel constrained to agree to the search due to the element of compulsion inherent in the nature of an encounter with the police. The need for such an advisement is all the greater when, as in the present case, the police lack even a reasonable and articulable suspicion that the detained vehicle contains contraband. Because Morgan failed to advise the defendant, I would conclude that the search violated the defendant\u2019s rights under article first, \u00a7 7. Accordingly, I respectfully dissent.<footnotemark>2</footnotemark></p>\n<p id=\"b329-5\">The undisputed facts and procedural history relevant to this issue are set forth in the majority opinion and require no repetition. I turn, therefore, to the legal principles that guide my analysis. \u201cIt is well established that federal constitutional and statutory law establishes a minimum national standard for the exercise of individual rights and does not inhibit state governments from affording higher levels of protection for such rights. . . . Furthermore, although we often rely on the United States Supreme Court\u2019s interpretation of the amendments to the constitution of the United States to delineate the boundaries of the protections provided by the constitution of Connecticut, we have also recognized <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"310\">*310</page-number>that, in some instances, our state constitution provides protections beyond those provided by the federal constitution, as that document has been inteipreted by the United States Supreme Court. . . . Indeed, this court has determined that, in certain respects, article first, \u00a7 7, of the state constitution affords greater protection than the fourth amendment to the United States constitution. E.g., <em>State </em>v. <em>Miller, </em>227 Conn. 363, 377, 630 A.2d 1315 (1993) (article first, \u00a7 7, requires police to obtain warrant to search impounded automobile); <em>State </em>v. <em>Geisler, </em>222 Conn. 672, 691-92, 610 A.2d 1225 (1992) (emergency exception to warrant requirement is narrower under article first, \u00a7 7, than under federal constitution); <em>State </em>v. <em>Marsala, </em>216 Conn. 150, 171, 579 A.2d 58 (1990) (good faith exception to warrant requirement does not exist under article first, \u00a7 7, of state constitution); <em>State </em>v. <em>Dukes, </em>209 Conn. 98, 120-21, 547 A.2d 10 (1988) (search incident to arrest exception to warrant requirement is narrower under article first, \u00a7 7, than under federal constitution). In determining the scope of the rights secured by our state constitution, the following tools of analysis should be considered to the extent applicable: (1) the [text of the constitutional provision] ... (2) holdings and dicta of this court ... (3) federal precedent ... (4) sister state decisions ... (5) the [history of the constitutional provision] . . . including the historical constitutional setting and the debates of the framers . . . and (6) economic/sociological considerations.\u201d<footnotemark>3</footnotemark> (Citation omitted; internal quotation marks omitted.) <em>State </em>v. <em>Davis, </em>283 Conn. 280, 305-306, 929 A.2d 278 (2007).</p>\n<p id=\"b330-5\">I agree with the majority that neither the text nor the constitutional history of article first, \u00a7 7, of the Connect<page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"311\">*311</page-number>icut constitution supports the defendant\u2019s claim that the state constitution affords greater protection than the federal constitution with respect to a request for consent to search a vehicle made by a police officer in connection with a routine traffic stop. I disagree, however, with the majority\u2019s analysis of the remaining <em>Geisler </em>factors,<footnotemark>4</footnotemark> which, in my view, leads to the conclusion that, under the state constitution, a consent search of such a vehicle is invalid unless the detained motorist is informed of his or her right to withhold consent to such a search.</p>\n<p id=\"b331-4\">I</p>\n<p id=\"b331-5\">FEDERAL PRECEDENT</p>\n<p id=\"b331-6\">As the majority observes, in <em>Schneckloth </em>v. <em>Busta-monte, </em>412 U.S. 218, 93 S. Ct. 2041, 36 L. Ed. 2d 854 (1973), the United States Supreme Court rejected the very same claim under the fourth amendment to the federal constitution that the defendant in the present case raises under the state constitution. Specifically, the court in <em>Schneckloth </em>concluded that \u201cthe question [of] whether a consent to a search was in fact \u2018voluntary\u2019 or was the product of duress or coercion, express or implied, is a question of fact to be determined from the totality of all the circumstances. While knowledge of the right to refuse consent is one factor to be taken into account, the government need not establish such knowledge as the sine qua non of an effective consent.\u201d Id., 227. For the reasons that follow, I am unpersuaded by the court\u2019s analysis in <em>Schneckloth, </em>at least in the context of a request for consent during a routine traffic stop.<footnotemark>5</footnotemark></p>\n<p id=\"b332-4\"><page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"312\">*312</page-number>In <em>Schneckloth, </em>the court commenced its analysis by observing that \u201c[t]he most extensive judicial exposition of the meaning of \u2018voluntariness\u2019 has been developed in those cases in which the [c]ourt has had to determine the \u2018voluntariness\u2019 of a defendant\u2019s confession for purposes of the [fourteenth [ajmendment.\u201d Id., 223. A review of these cases, the court explained, reveals \u201cno talismanic definition of \u2018voluntariness,\u2019 mechanically applicable to the host of situations [in which] the question has arisen. ... It cannot be taken literally to mean a \u2018knowing\u2019 choice.\u201d (Citation omitted.) Id., 224. \u201cRather, \u2018voluntariness\u2019 has reflected an accommodation of the complex of values implicated in police questioning of a suspect. At one end of the spectrum is the acknowledged need for police questioning as a tool for the effective enforcement of criminal laws. ... At the other end of the spectrum is the set of values reflecting society\u2019s deeply felt belief that the criminal law cannot be used as an instrument of unfairness, and that the possibility of unfair and even brutal police tactics poses a real and serious threat to civilized notions of justice.\u201d (Citations omitted.) Id., 224-25. The court further explained that, in light of these competing concerns, it traditionally has framed the test for voluntariness as whether \u201cthe confession [is] the product of an essentially free and unconstrained choice by its maker . . . .\u201d Id., 225. In making this determination, the court made clear that the totality of the circumstances must be considered, and, although the accused\u2019s awareness of his constitutional rights is one of several factors relevant to that determination, it is not a dispositive factor. Id., 226-27.</p>\n<p id=\"b332-5\">The court in <em>Schneckloth </em>reasoned that a similar analysis should apply to the determination of whether a suspect voluntarily has given consent to search. \u201cAs with police questioning, two competing concerns must be accommodated in determining the meaning of a \u2018vol<page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"313\">*313</page-number>untary\u2019 consent \u2014 the legitimate need for such searches and the equally important requirement of assuring the absence of coercion.\u201d Id., 227. In reaching this conclusion, the court observed that, in cases in which the police may \u201chave some evidence of illicit activity, but lack probable cause to arrest or search,\u201d consent searches serve a vital purpose because they \u201cmay be the only means of obtaining important and rehable evidence.\u201d Id. These searches, the court stated, may \u201c[provide] some assurance that [third parties], wholly innocent of the crime, [will] not [be] mistakenly brought to trial.\u201d Id., 228.</p>\n<p id=\"b333-5\">The court then stated that requiring the state to prove \u201caffirmatively . . . that the subject of the search knew that he had a right to refuse consent would, in practice, create serious doubt [about] whether consent searches could continue to be conducted.\u201d Id., 229. In support of this assertion, the court explained: \u201cThere might be rare cases [in which] it could be proved from the record that a person in fact affirmatively knew of his right to refuse .... But more commonly where there was no evidence of any coercion, explicit or implicit, the prosecution would nevertheless be unable to demonstrate that the subject of the search in fact had known of his right to refuse consent.\u201d Id., 229-30. \u201cThe very object of the inquiry \u2014 the nature of a person\u2019s subjective understanding \u2014 underlines the difficulty of the prosecution\u2019s burden under [a] rule [that would require proof of such knowledge]. Any defendant who [is] the subject of a search authorized solely by his consent could effectively frustrate the introduction into evidence of the fruits of that search by simply failing to testify that he in fact knew [that] he could refuse to consent. And the near impossibility of meeting this prosecutorial burden suggests why [the] [c]ourt has never accepted any such litmus-paper test of voluntariness.\u201d Id., 230.</p>\n<p id=\"b334-4\"><page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"314\">*314</page-number>The court in <em>Schneckloth </em>acknowledged that the police officer seeking consent to search the vehicle in that case simply could have informed the subject of the traffic stop that he had the right to withhold such consent. The court, however, rejected that approach, reasoning as follows: \u201cOne alternative that would go far toward proving that the subject of a search did know [that] he had a right to refuse consent would be to advise him of that right before eliciting his consent. . . . [I]t would be thoroughly impractical [however] to impose on the normal consent search the detailed requirements of an effective warning. Consent searches are part of the standard investigatory techniques of law enforcement agencies. They normally occur on the highway, or in a person\u2019s home or office, and under informal and unstructured conditions. The circumstances that prompt the initial request to search may develop quickly or be a logical extension of investigative police questioning. The police may seek to investigate further suspicious circumstances or to follow up leads developed in questioning persons at the scene of a crime. These situations are a far cry from the structured atmosphere of a trial where, assisted by counsel if he chooses, a defendant is informed of his trial rights. . . . And, while surely a closer question, these situations are still immeasurably far removed from \u2018custodial interrogation\u2019 where, in <em>Miranda </em>v. <em>Arizona, </em>[384 U.S. 436, 86 S. Ct. 1602, 16 L. Ed. 2d 694 (1966)], we found that the [constitution required certain now familiar warnings as a prerequisite to police interrogation.\u201d (Citation omitted.) <em>Schneckloth </em>v. <em>Bustamonte, </em>supra, 412 U.S. 231-32.</p>\n<p id=\"b334-6\">The court in <em>Schneckloth </em>also rejected the respondent\u2019s contention that, because \u201c \u2018consent\u2019 is a waiver of a person\u2019s rights under the [fourth and [fourteenth Amendments,\u201d to establish waiver, the state must be required to \u201cdemonstrate \u2018an intentional relinquishment <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"315\">*315</page-number>or abandonment of a known right or privilege.\u2019 \u201d Id., 235. In so concluding, the court observed that a knowing and intelligent waiver is not required whenever a subject declines to invoke a constitutional protection; instead, waiver analysis applies only to those rights needed to protect the fairness of a trial or trial-type proceeding. Id., 237-38. By way of example, the court observed that, in <em>Miranda, </em>it had \u201cfound that <em>custodial </em>interrogation by the police was inherently coercive, and consequently held that detailed warnings were required to protect the privilege against compulsory self-incrimination. The [c]ourt [in Miranda] made it clear that the basis for [its] decision was the need to protect the fairness of the trial itself:</p>\n<p id=\"b335-5\">\u201c \u2018That counsel is present when statements are taken from an individual during interrogation obviously enhances the integrity of the fact-finding processes in court. . . . Without the protections flowing from adequate warnings and the rights of counsel, \u201call the careful safeguards erected around the giving of testimony, whether by an accused or any other witness, would become empty formalities in a procedure where the most compelling possible evidence of guilt, a confession, would have already been obtained at the unsupervised pleasure of the police.\u201d \u2019 <em>[Miranda </em>v. <em>Arizona, </em>supra, 384 U.S. 466].\u201d (Emphasis in original.) <em>Schneck-loth </em>v. <em>Bustamonte, </em>supra, 412 U.S. 240.</p>\n<p id=\"b335-6\">The court continued: \u201c[T]here is a vast difference between those rights that protect a fair criminal trial and the rights guaranteed under the [fjourth [a]mendment.\u201d Id., 241. Thus, the court concluded that there was no reason to extend the requirement of a knowing and intelligent waiver to consent searches. See id. The fourth amendment, the court explained, was not designed to protect the accuracy of the truth determining process at trial; instead, it protects an individual\u2019s privacy against arbitrary intrusion by the police. Id., <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"316\">*316</page-number>242. In support of this assertion, the court relied on its prior determination that \u201cthere is no likelihood of unreliability or coercion present in a search-and-seizure case . . . .\u201d (Citation omitted; internal quotation marks omitted.) Id. Consequently, the court maintained, \u201cit cannot be said [that] every reasonable presumption ought to be indulged against voluntary relinquishment. . . . [I]t is no part of the policy underlying the [fourth and [fourteenth [a]mendments to discourage citizens from aiding to the utmost of their ability in the apprehension of criminals. . . . Rather, the community has a real interest in encouraging consent, for the resulting search may yield necessary evidence for the solution and prosecution of crime, evidence that may [e]nsure that a wholly innocent person is not wrongly charged with a [crime].\u201d (Citation omitted; internal quotation marks omitted.) Id., 243.</p>\n<p id=\"b336-6\">The court further explained that \u201cit would be next to impossible to apply to a consent search the standard of \u2018an intentional relinquishment or abandonment of a known right or privilege.\u2019 \u201d Id. According to the court, in determining whether one knowingly and voluntarily has waived a right, a trial judge in \u201cthe structured atmosphere of a courtroom\u201d must conduct an examination into whether there is an intelligent and competent waiver by the accused. Id., 243-44. This detailed examination would be unrealistic in the \u201cinformal, unstructured context of a consent search .... And if, for this reason a diluted form of \u2018waiver\u2019 were found [to be] acceptable, that would itself be ample recognition of the fact that there is no universal standard that must be applied in every situation [in which] a person forgoes a constitutional right.\u201d Id., 245.</p>\n<p id=\"b336-7\">Finally, the court explained that <em>Miranda </em>does not compel a knowledge requirement in the context of a consent search. Id., 246. The court asserted that, unlike the inherent coerciveness of custodial interrogation <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"317\">*317</page-number>that requires safeguards to ensure voluntariness, consent searches \u201cnormally occur on a person\u2019s own familiar territory . . . [and thus] the specter of incommunicado police interrogation in some remote station house is simply inapposite. There is no reason to believe . . . that the response to a policeman\u2019s question is presumptively coerced; and there is, therefore, no reason to reject the traditional test for determining the volun-tariness of a person\u2019s response. <em>Miranda, </em>of course, did not reach investigative questioning of a person not in custody, which is most directly analogous to the situation of a consent search, and it assuredly did not indicate that such questioning ought to be deemed inherently coercive.\u201d Id., 247. The court thus concluded that a consent search following a routine traffic stop may pass muster under the fourth amendment even though the police have not informed the subject of the stop that he or she may decline to give consent to the search. See id., 248-49.</p>\n<p id=\"b337-5\">In separate opinions, Justices William O. Douglas, William J. Brennan, Jr., and Thurgood Marshall dissented from the opinion of the majority in <em>Schneckloth. </em>Justice Douglas concluded that a suspect should be informed of his right to withhold consent because, \u201c \u2018[u]nder many circumstances a reasonable person might read an officer\u2019s \u201c[m]ay I\u201d as the courteous expression of a demand backed by force of law.\u2019 \u201d Id., 275-76 (Douglas, J., dissenting). In the same vein, Justice Brennan stated that \u201c[t]he [c]ourt holds . . . that an individual can effectively waive this right even though he is totally ignorant of the fact that, in the absence of his consent, such invasions of his privacy would be constitutionally prohibited. It wholly escapes me how our citizens can meaningfully be said to have waived something as precious as a constitutional guarantee without ever being aware of its existence.\u201d Id., 277 (Brennan, J., dissenting).</p>\n<p id=\"b338-4\"><page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"318\">*318</page-number>Justice Marshall\u2019s dissent has been celebrated by commentators and scholars. See, e.g., A. Loewy, \u201cKnowing \u2018Consent\u2019 Means \u2018Knowing Consent\u2019: The Underap-preciated Wisdom of Justice Marshall\u2019s <em>Schneckloth </em>v. <em>Bustamonte </em>Dissent,\u201d 79 Miss. L.J. 97, 104-108 (2009). Justice Marshall begins his dissent with the observation that, \u201c[s]everal years ago, [Justice Potter Stewart, the author of the majority opinion in Schneckloth] reminded us that \u2018[t]he [constitution guarantees ... a society of free choice. Such a society presupposes the capacity of its members to choose.\u2019 <em>Ginsburg </em>v. <em>New York, </em>390 U.S. 629, 649 [88 S. Ct. 1274, 20 L. Ed. 2d 195] (1968) ([Stewart, J.] concurring in result). I would have thought that the capacity to choose necessarily depends [on] knowledge that there is a choice to be made. But . . . the [majority in Schneckloth] reaches the curious result that one can choose to relinquish a constitutional right \u2014 the right to be free [from] unreasonable searches \u2014 without knowing that he has the alternative of refusing to accede to a police request to search.\u201d <em>Schneckloth </em>v. <em>Bustamonte, </em>supra, 412 U.S. 277 (Marshall, J., dissenting). Injustice Marshall\u2019s view, because the United States Supreme Court always had \u201cscrutinized with great care claims that a person has forgone the opportunity to assert constitutional rights,\u201d there is no reason why that analysis should not apply with equal force to the issue of \u201cwhether a simple statement of assent to search, without more, should be sufficient to permit the police to search and thus act as a relinquishment of [that person\u2019s] constitutional right to exclude the police.\u201d Id., 278 (Marshall, J., dissenting).</p>\n<p id=\"b338-5\">After concluding that cases involving coerced confessions are inapposite in the context of a consent search,<footnotemark>6</footnotemark> <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"319\">*319</page-number>Justice Marshall rejected the assertion of the majority in <em>Schneckloth </em>that consent \u201c \u2018cannot be taken literally to mean a \u201cknowing\u201d choice.\u2019 \u201d Id., 284 (Marshall, J., dissenting). Indeed, Justice Marshall explained that he had \u201cdifficulty in comprehending how a decision made without knowledge of available alternatives can be treated as a choice at all.\u201d Id. Furthermore, \u201c[i]f consent to search means that a person has chosen to forgo his right to exclude the police from the place they seek to <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"320\">*320</page-number>search, it follows that his consent cannot be considered a meaningful choice unless he knew that he could in fact exclude the police. ... I can think of no other situation in which we would say that a person agreed to some course of action if he convinced us that he did not know that there was some other course he might have pursued. I would therefore hold, at a minimum, that the prosecution may not rely on a purported consent to search if the subject of the search did not know that he could refuse to give consent. . . . Where the police claim authority to search yet in fact lack such authority, the subject does not know that he may permissibly refuse them entry, and it is this lack of knowledge that invalidates the consent.\u201d<footnotemark>7</footnotemark> (Citations omitted.) Id., 284-85 (Marshall, J., dissenting).</p>\n<p id=\"b340-5\">Justice Marshall also rejected the majority\u2019s assertion that, \u201cif an officer paused to inform the subject of his rights, the informality of the exchange would be destroyed. I doubt that a simple statement by an officer of an individual\u2019s right to refuse consent would do much to alter the informality of the exchange, except to alert the subject to a fact that he surely is entitled to know. It is not without significance that for many years the agents of the Federal Bureau of Investigation have routinely informed subjects of their right to refuse consent, when they request consent to search. . . . The reported cases in which the police have informed subjects of their right to refuse consent show, also, that <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"321\">*321</page-number>the information can be given without disrupting the casual flow of events. . . . What evidence there is, then, rather strongly suggests that nothing disastrous would happen if the police, before requesting consent, informed the subject that he ha[s] a right to refuse consent and that his refusal would be respected.\u201d (Citations omitted.) Id., 287-88 (Marshall, J., dissenting).</p>\n<p id=\"b341-5\">Justice Marshall concluded \u201cthat when the [majority in <em>Schneckloth] </em>speaks of practicality, what it really is talking of is the continued ability of the police to capitalize on the ignorance of citizens so as to accomplish by subterfuge what they could not achieve by relying only on the knowing relinquishment of constitutional rights. . . .</p>\n<p id=\"b341-6\">\u201cI find nothing in the [majority] opinion [in <em>Schneckloth] </em>to dispel my belief that . . . \u2018[u]nder many circumstances a reasonable person might read an officer\u2019s \u201c[m]ay I\u201d as the courteous expression of a demand backed by force of law.\u2019 . . . Most cases, in my view . . . [reflect that] consent ordinarily is given as acquiescence in an implicit claim of authority to search. Permitting searches in such circumstances, without any assurance at all that the subject of the search knew that, by his consent, he was relinquishing his constitutional rights, is something that I cannot believe is sanctioned by the [constitution.\u201d (Citations omitted.) Id., 288-89 (Marshall, J., dissenting).</p>\n<p id=\"b341-7\">The United States Supreme Court reaffirmed its holding in <em>Schneckloth </em>in <em>Ohio </em>v. <em>Robinette, </em>519 U.S. 33, 39-40, 117 S. Ct. 417, 136 L. Ed. 2d 347 (1996). <em>In Robi-nette, </em>the state of Ohio appealed from the judgment of the Supreme Court of Ohio, which had adopted the following rule under the United States and Ohio constitutions: \u201c \u2018[C]itizens stopped for traffic offenses [must] be clearly informed by the detaining officer when they are free to go after a valid detention, before an officer <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"322\">*322</page-number>attempts to engage in a consensual interrogation. Any attempt at consensual interrogation must be preceded by the phrase \u201c[a]t this time you legally are free to go\u201d or by words of similar import.\u2019 \u201d Id., 36.

See <em>Kerrigan </em>v. <em>Commissioner of Public Health, </em>289 Conn. 135, 230-31, 957 A.2d 407 (2008) (\u201c[we examine federal] precedent for guidance and analogy [in construing our own constitution but only] when [those] authorities are logically persuasive and well-reasoned\u201d [internal quotation marks omitted]); cf. <em>State </em>v. <em>Brunetti, </em>276 Conn. 40, 115, 883 A.2d 1167 (2005) <em>(Palmer, J., </em>dissenting) (\u201ca judicial opinion must be judged not on the number of votes that it has garnered but on its reasoning\u201d), superseded by <em>State </em>v. <em>Brunetti, </em>279 Conn. 39, 901 A.2d 1 (2006), cert. denied, 549 U.S. 1212, 127 S. Ct. 1328, 167 L. Ed. 2d 85 (2007). Thus, when this court undertakes an independent analysis of the meaning of article first, \u00a7 7, of the state constitution, it may reject as lacking in persuasive force, for state constitutional purposes, precedent of the United States Supreme Court construing the analogous provisions of the fourth amendment to the federal constitution. Indeed, not infrequently, this court, in interpreting article first, \u00a7 7, has rejected the reasoning and holding of a majority opinion of the United States Supreme Court and, instead, expressly or implicitly adopted the reasoning employed by one or more dissenting justices of that court. See, e.g., <em>State </em>v. <em>Miller, </em>supra, 227 Conn. 377 (declining to adopt rule in <em>Chambers </em>v. <em>Maroney, </em>399 U.S. 42, 51-52, 90 S. Ct. 1975, 26 L.

In the foregoing cases, as in other cases, we have rejected United States Supreme Court precedent in interpreting our state constitution because, as this court previously has observed, \u201cdecisions of the United States Supreme Court defining fundamental rights are persuasive authority to be afforded respectful consideration, but they are to be followed by Connecticut courts only when they provide no less individual protection than is guaranteed by Connecticut law.\u201d (Internal quotation <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"325\">*325</page-number>marks omitted.) <em>State </em>v. <em>Marsala, </em>supra, 216 Conn. 160, quoting <em>Horton </em>v. <em>Meskill, </em>172 Conn. 615, 642, 376 A.2d 359 (1977).

This criticism is based on certain flaws in several of the assumptions that underlie the reasoning of the majority opinion in <em>Schneckloth.</em></p>\n<p id=\"b346-5\">First, <em>Schneckloth </em>has been criticized for overlooking the coercive effect that an officer\u2019s request for consent is likely to have on a motorist who has been detained in connection with a traffic stop. As one commentator has stated, \u201c[w]hat is remarkable ... is the ever-widening gap between [f]ourth [a]mendment consent jurisprudence, on the one hand, and scientific findings about the psychology of compliance and consent on the other. Ever since the [c]ourt first applied the \u2018totality of the circumstances\u2019 standard to consent search issues in <em>Schneckloth </em>... in 1973, it has held in case after case, with only a few exceptions, that a reasonable person in the situation in question either would feel free to terminate the encounter with [the] police, or would feel free to refuse the police request to search. By contrast, empirical studies over the last several decades on the social psychology of compliance, conformity, social influence, and politeness have all converged on a single conclusion: the extent to which people feel free to refuse to comply is extremely limited under situation-ally induced pressures.\u201d J. Nadler, \u201cNo Need to Shout: Bus Sweeps and the Psychology of Coercion,\u201d 2002 Sup. Ct. Rev. 153, 155.

See M. Strauss, supra, 92 J. Grim. L. &amp; Criminology 236-42. For example, it seems evident, on the basis of empirical research regarding obedience to authority and uniform, that individuals \u201cattribute legitimacy to the police officer\u2019s uniform [and] that they obey police authority reflexively.\u201d A. Barrio, supra, 1997 U. Ill. L. Rev. 243; see also J. Burkoff, \u201cSearch Me?,\u201d 39 Tex. Tech L. Rev. 1109, 1138 (2007) (\u201cmost people do not expect that they have the right not to accede a police officer\u2019s request that a search be authorized\u201d [internal quotation marks omitted]). Consequently, \u201cthe weight of scientific authority suggests that a suspect\u2019s ignorance of fundamental [f]ourth [a]mendment rights must be viewed as a state of mind that renders a suspect\u2019s consent involuntary.\u201d A. Barrio, supra, 247; see also id., 240 (\u201c[the] obedience theory casts serious doubt on the continued vitality of what <em>Schneckloth </em>characterized as <em>Miranda\u2019s </em>central holding: that custody is a necessary prerequisite for a finding of psychological coercion\u201d). Thus, \u201c[t]o curb the coercive power of police authority, the police officer should be required to advise the suspect of his right to withhold consent prior to requesting his permission to search. Such a warning would combat the obedience phenomenon by assuring the suspect both that he is under no obligation to give consent and that the investigating officer is \u2018prepared to recognize his privilege.\u2019 \u201d Id., 247; see also 4 W. LaFave, Search and Seizure (4th Ed. 2004) \u00a7 8.2 (i), pp. 111-12 (expressing support for such approach).</p>\n<p id=\"b348-5\">The factual scenario in the present case provides a good example of why the court in <em>Schneckloth </em>was wrong in concluding that a motorist stopped for a traffic violation is not likely to feel compelled to agree to a <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"329\">*329</page-number>police officer\u2019s request for permission to search his or her vehicle. According to the court in <em>Schneckloth, </em>there is no reason to believe that the subject of such a stop will view the encounter as coercive because the search \u201coccur [s] on [the driver\u2019s] own familiar territory [where] the specter of incommunicado police interrogation in some remote station house is . . . inapposite.\u201d <em>Schneckloth </em>v. <em>Bustamonte, </em>supra, 412 U.S. 247. Of course, there can be no doubt that police interrogation of a person held incommunicado and far from home gives rise to a legitimate concern about the voluntariness of any statement obtained as a result of such interrogation, and so, too, is the voluntariness of the defendant\u2019s consent to search open to serious doubt. The defendant, an African-American from out of state and traveling alone, was stopped by Detective Morgan shortly before midnight and pulled over in a dark area of the Berlin Turnpike. Morgan operated an unmarked car but was dressed in full police uniform and possessed a firearm, a utility belt with handcuffs, pepper spray and a flashlight, all in plain view. While preparing the traffic citation in his cruiser, Morgan called for a backup police officer because, unbeknownst to the defendant, Morgan intended to request that the defendant consent to a search of his vehicle. That backup officer, Sergeant Derrick Sutton, who also was in full police uniform, arrived before Morgan had returned to the defendant\u2019s vehicle. At that point, ten to fifteen minutes had passed since the defendant had been stopped. Morgan then approached the defendant and told him to exit his car. Morgan explained the citation to the defendant but did not give it to him at that time. Rather, Morgan asked the defendant whether he had anything illegal on his person, and, when the defendant said that he did not, Morgan patted him down. Morgan then asked the defendant if he had anything illegal in the vehicle, and the defendant responded that all he had in the car was <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"330\">*330</page-number>some beer on the floor in front of the passenger seat. When the defendant told Morgan that he could \u201cgo ahead and check,\u201d Morgan conducted a search of the defendant\u2019s vehicle.</p>\n<p id=\"b350-5\">It is fanciful to think that the circumstances that led to the search of the defendant\u2019s vehicle did not give ris\u00e9 to a substantial element of compulsion. The defendant, an African-American who does not reside in this state, was pulled over in a dark area of the highway, late at night, by an armed police officer, and detained there, in his car, for up to fifteen minutes, at which point a second armed police officer arrived at the scene in a separate cruiser. Morgan then directed the defendant to exit his vehicle, questioned him about contraband on his person, conducted a patdown search, and asked him whether he had any contraband in the vehicle. It is difficult to see how anyone held under such circumstances would not feel vulnerable as a result of the encounter with the police, and there is little doubt that, in light of that vulnerability, the average person in that situation also would feel the need to accommodate, if not placate, the police officers involved in the encounter.</p>\n<p id=\"b350-6\">A second criticism of Schneckloth, which also is based on empirical evidence, concerns the assertion that a knowledge requirement could jeopardize the continued viability of consent searches. In fact, studies suggest just the opposite, that is, that it appears that persons subjected to traffic stops give consent to vehicle searches at the same rate regardless of whether they are aware that such consent may be withheld. See, e.g., I. Lichtenberg, <em>\u201cMiranda </em>in Ohio: The Effects of <em>Robinette </em>on the \u2018Voluntary\u2019 Waiver of Fourth Amendment Rights,\u201d 44 How. L.J. 349, 370, 373 (2001) (study demonstrated that between approximately 75 and 95 percent of motorists agree to police search of vehicle and that rates were very similar regardless of whether <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"331\">*331</page-number>motorists were apprised of their right to refuse such consent, and, consequently, assertion of court in <em>Schneckloth </em>that such advisement would jeopardize continued viability of consent searches was \u201c[c]learly . . . unfounded\u201d); M. Phillips, note, \u201cEffective Warnings Before Consent Searches: Practical, Necessary, and Desirable,\u201d 45 Am. Crim. L. Rev. 1185, 1201 (2008) (citing study demonstrating that approximately 88 percent of motorists agree to consent search after being advised verbally and in writing of right to refuse consent). These findings should not be surprising in light of the fact that approximately 84 percent of suspects who have been advised of their rights in accordance with <em>Miranda </em>nevertheless waive their right to remain silent and comply with a request by the police for a statement. See S. Chanenson, \u201cGet the Facts, Jack! Empirical Research and the Changing Constitutional Landscape of Consent Searches,\u201d 71 Tenn. L. Rev. 399, 442 (2004).</p>\n<p id=\"b351-5\">Although these data indicating that the provision of warnings has little effect on the rate at which consent is granted may suggest that such warnings are ineffective, it fairly may be argued that warnings nevertheless serve a salutary purpose insofar as they are likely to reduce the compulsion that people feel on the basis of \u201can inaccurate belief that the police have the legal right to compel them to [agree to the requested] search.\u201d R. Simmons, supra, 80 Ind. L.J. 819. To be sure, motorists undoubtedly have a multitude of reasons for granting consent to search, not all of which are the product of the inherently coercive nature of the police stop and following encounter; see <em>People </em>v. James, 19 Cal. 3d 99, 114, 561 P.2d 1135, 137 Cal. Rptr. 447 (1977) (\u201c[T]here may be a number of \u2018rational reasons\u2019 for a suspect to consent to a search even though he knows the premises contain evidence that can be used against him: for example, he may wish to appear cooperative <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"332\">*332</page-number>in order to throw the police off the scent or at least to lull them into conducting a superficial search; he may believe the evidence is of such a nature or in such a location that it is likely to be overlooked; he may be persuaded that if the evidence is nevertheless discovered he will be successful in explaining its presence or denying any knowledge of it; he may intend to lay the groundwork for ingratiating himself with the prosecuting authorities or the courts; or he may simply be convinced that the game is up and further dissembling is futile.\u201d); and, consequently, warnings may have an impact on what may be considered negative forms of compulsion, such as acquiescence to a show of authority. See R. Simmons, supra, 820; see also R. Ward, supra, 15 Touro L. Rev. 477 (\u201c[t]he combined forces of obedience to authority, the power of the uniform and lower expectations of privacy make it imperative that citizens be told from the outset that they do have a choice\u201d). Indeed, the importance of <em>Miranda </em>warnings is widely accepted even though the large majority of suspects who are advised of their rights under <em>Miranda </em>nevertheless give a statement to the police.</p>\n<p id=\"b352-5\">There also seems to be little or no basis for the assertions of the court in <em>Schneckloth </em>that it would be unreasonable to burden the state with having to prove that a motorist who gives consent to search during the course of a routine traffic stop was aware of his or her right to refuse consent; <em>Schneckloth </em>v. <em>Bustamonte, </em>supra, 412 U.S. 229-30; and that requiring the police to advise motorists of their right to withhold consent to search would adversely affect the informality of the encounter, thereby impairing the ability of the police to use the consent search as a standard investigatory technique. See id., 231-32. With respect to the court\u2019s first assertion, I see no reason why the state could not meet its burden of proving knowledge simply by demonstrating that the officer at the scene had advised <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"333\">*333</page-number>the motorist of the right to withhold consent and that he or she was free to leave upon choosing that option. Indeed, in the ordinary case, the state\u2019s burden would be readily satisfied by testimony from the police officer that the subject of the stop was so advised. The court\u2019s second assertion, namely, that it would be \u201cthoroughly impractical\u201d to require the police to give such an advisement; id., 231; also is dubious. The advisement would take but a few seconds and easily could be given at the same time that the officer seeks the motorist\u2019s consent to search. See, e.g., M. Phillips, supra, 45 Am. Crim. L. Rev. 1185-86 (observing that high courts of several states have required police to provide warnings before seeking consent to search and asserting that \u201c[a] review of the experience [s] of these states indicates that a warning requirement is practical\u201d); E. Smary, note, \u201cThe Doctrine of Waiver and Consent Searches,\u201d 49 Notre Dame L. Rev. 891, 903 (1974) (criticizing as \u201cstraw-man logic\u201d court\u2019s assertion in <em>Schneckloth </em>that it would be thoroughly impractical for police officer to engage in detailed examination needed to ensure valid waiver); cf. J. Adams, \u201cSearch and Seizure as Seen By Supreme Court Justices: Are They Serious or Is This Just Judicial Humor?,\u201d 12 St. Louis U. Pub. L. Rev. 413,446-47 (1993) (criticizing court\u2019s consideration in <em>Schneckloth </em>of practical considerations of police in assessing whether advisement of right to withhold consent should be required).</p>\n<p id=\"b353-5\">Finally, the court in <em>Schneckloth </em>has been criticized for essentially ignoring the issue of how a consent to search fairly may be deemed to be truly voluntary when the person giving consent does not know that he or she has an absolute right, protected by the constitution, to refuse to do so. Thus, as one commentator has stated, \u201c[a]ny competent person can give up rights at the request of the government. But it is hard to comprehend a theory of individual rights that permits that decision <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"334\">*334</page-number>to be made by someone unaware that he is relinquishing a fundamental civil liberty.\u201d M. Cloud, \u201cIgnorance and Democracy,\u201d 39 Tex. Tech L. Rev. 1143, 1169 (2007).</p>\n<p id=\"b354-5\">In sum, because the reasons underlying the court\u2019s holding in <em>Schneckloth </em>ultimately are not persuasive, the holding of the court is itself not persuasive.<footnotemark>10</footnotemark> Indeed, the dissenting opinions in <em>Schneckloth </em>are significantly more convincing than the opinion of the majority in <em>Schneckloth. </em>This court therefore is not bound to adopt the holding of the majority opinion in <em>Schneckloth </em>for purposes of the state constitution.</p>\n<p id=\"b354-6\">II</p>\n<p id=\"b354-7\">HOLDINGS AND DICTA OF THIS COURT</p>\n<p id=\"b354-8\">As I discussed in part I of this opinion, this court has interpreted article first, \u00a7 7, of the Connecticut constitution as providing protections beyond those guaranteed under the fourth amendment to the federal constitution in a variety of different contexts. In no case, however, has this court or the Appellate Court previously had occasion to consider the scope of article first, \u00a7 7, in the context of consent searches generally or, more specifically, in the context of a consent search of a vehicle following a routine traffic stop. Accordingly, Connecticut precedent is neutral on the issue of whether the state constitution provides the same or greater protection than the federal constitution with respect to searches of the kind conducted in the present case.</p>\n<p id=\"b355-4\"><page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"335\">*335</page-number>III</p>\n<p id=\"b355-5\">SISTER STATE DECISIONS</p>\n<p id=\"b355-6\">A significant majority of the states that have considered the issue apply the <em>Schneckloth </em>totality of the circumstances test in assessing whether consent was voluntary for purposes of their state constitutions, and do not require an express advisement of the right to withhold consent. E.g., <em>Henry </em>v. <em>State, </em>621 P.2d 1, 4 and n.9 (Alaska 1980); <em>State </em>v. <em>Knaubert, </em>27 Ariz. App. 53, 56-57, 550 P.3d 1095 (1976), overruled on other grounds by <em>State </em>v. <em>Grilz, </em>136 Ariz. 450, 666 P.2d 1059 (1983); <em>People </em>v. <em>Hayhurst, </em>194 Colo. 292, 295-96, 571 P.2d 721 (1977); <em>State </em>v. <em>Thompson, </em>284 Kan. 763, 779-81, 166 P.3d 1015 (2007); <em>Scott </em>v. <em>State, </em>366 Md. 121, 145, 782 A.2d 862 (2001), cert. denied, 535 U.S. 940, 122 S.

For many of the reasons set forth in part I of this opinion, however, I believe that the cases that have rejected <em>Schneckloth </em>are better reasoned and, therefore, more persuasive with respect to the determination of whether consent voluntarily was granted in the inherently coercive context of a routine traffic stop.</p>\n<p id=\"b355-7\">For example, in <em>State </em>v. <em>Johnson, </em>68 N.J. 349, 353-54, 346 A.2d 66 (1975), the New Jersey Supreme Court <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"336\">*336</page-number>rejected <em>Schneckloth </em>in construing the New Jersey constitution<footnotemark>11</footnotemark> and imposed a knowledge requirement for consent searches.<footnotemark>12</footnotemark> The court in <em>Johnson </em>observed that \u201c[m]any persons, perhaps most, would view the request of a police officer to make a search as having the force of law. Unless it is shown by the [sjtate that the person involved knew that he had the right to refuse to accede to such a request, his assenting to the search is not meaningful. One cannot be held to have waived a right if he was unaware of its existence.\u201d Id., 354. The court therefore concluded that when \u201cthe [s]tate seeks to justify a search on the basis of consent it has the burden of showing that the consent was voluntary, an essential element of which is knowledge of the right to refuse consent.\u201d Id., 353-54. Although the court declined to impose a strict warning requirement in noncustodial settings, under the New Jersey constitution, the state must demonstrate that the defendant knew that he or she had the right to refuse to give consent.<footnotemark>13</footnotemark> Id.</p>\n<p id=\"b356-5\">Justice Morris Pashman dissented. Although he agreed with the majority in rejecting <em>Schneckloth </em>for purposes of the New Jersey constitution, he concluded that the standard that the majority adopted fell \u201cshort of what [was] necessary to protect the privacy rights of the consenting individual.\u201d Id., 359 (Pashman, J., <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"337\">*337</page-number>dissenting). Recognizing that a person confronted with a request by the police for consent to search is likely to feel an element of compulsion due to the nature of the encounter, Justice Pashman concluded that the state should be obligated to establish that that person was aware of his right to withhold consent and that the police would respect his decision to withhold consent if he chose to do so. Id., 366 (Pashman, J., dissenting). Justice Pashman explained: \u201cI find it inconceivable and incomprehensible to suppose that an individual can be said to have relinquished privileges as fundamental as those embodied in our constitutional guarantees against unreasonable searches and seizures unless it clearly and unmistakably appears that the subject of the search knew that he did not have to submit to the official request. <em>Schneckloth . . </em>. cannot withstand close scrutiny when it treats that knowledge as merely one factor to be considered in determining the validity of a consent search.\u201d Id., 367-68 (Pashman, J., dissenting).</p>\n<p id=\"b357-5\">Similarly, in <em>Penick </em>v. <em>State, </em>440 So. 2d 547, 551 (Miss. 1983), the Mississippi Supreme Court concluded, contrary to the holding of <em>Schneckloth, </em>that a knowing waiver is necessary before consent may be deemed valid under the Mississippi constitution. Subsequently, the Mississippi Supreme Court clarified that the state is not required to prove that the defendant had knowledge of his or her right to refuse consent; instead, the defendant must show \u201cimpaired consent or some diminished capacity.\u201d (Internal quotation marks omitted.) <em>Graves </em>v. <em>State, </em>708 So. 2d 858, 863 (Miss. 1997). Thus, \u201c [i]f the defendant claims that his waiver was not knowledgeable, the burden is on him to raise the issue of lack of knowledgeable waiver. Knowledgeable waiver is defined as consent [when] the defendant knows that he or she has a right to refuse, being cognizant of his or her rights in the premises.\u201d Id., 864. Although this standard is not crystal clear, most courts have interpre<page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"338\">*338</page-number>ted it as requiring a knowledgeable waiver for all consent searches. See, e.g., <em>Commonwealth </em>v. <em>Cleckley, </em>supra, 558 Pa. 526.</p>\n<p id=\"b358-5\">In a context analogous to the temporary detention of the subject of a routine traffic stop, that is, a consensual investigative encounter,<footnotemark>14</footnotemark> the Hawaii Supreme Court has concluded that, under the Hawaii constitution, an investigating officer must inform the subject of a suspi-cionless encounter of his or her right to terminate the encounter.<footnotemark>15</footnotemark> See <em>State </em>v. Kearns, 75 Haw. 558, 570-72, 867 P.2d 903 (1994). In particular, the court concluded that \u201can investigative encounter can ... be deemed \u2018consensual\u2019 [only] if (1) prior to the start of questioning, the person encountered was informed that he or she had the right to decline to participate in the encounter and could leave at any time, and (2) the person thereafter voluntarily participated in the encounter.\u201d<footnotemark>16</footnotemark> Id., 571.</p>\n<p id=\"b359-4\"><page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"339\">*339</page-number>In reaching its conclusion, the court observed that \u201c[i]t is appropriate to require police officers who wish to question individuals without even a reasonable suspicion of criminal activity to ensure that the individuals are aware of their rights, because \u2018no system of criminal justice can, or should, survive if it comes to depend for its continued effectiveness on the citizens\u2019 abdication through unawareness of their constitutional rights.\u2019 <em>Escobedo </em>v. <em>Illinois, </em>378 U.S. 478, 490 [84 S. Ct. 1758, 12 L. Ed. 2d 977] (1964) .... Moreover, \u2018if the exercise of constitutional rights will thwart the effectiveness of a system of law enforcement, then there is something very wrong with that system.\u2019 Id.\u201d <em>State </em>v. <em>Kearns, </em>supra, 75 Haw. 571. Indeed, in a subsequent case, <em>State </em>v. <em>Trainor, 83 </em>Haw. 250, 925 P.2d 818 (1996), the Hawaii Supreme Court explained that, \u201c[i]n the context of walk and talk investigations<footnotemark>17</footnotemark> . . . [c]onsent . . . can hardly be viewed as either voluntary or intelligent if it <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"340\">*340</page-number>is obtained through such material nondisclosures as an officer\u2019s failure to advise the consenting individual. . . that the individual is free to go at any time.\u201d (Internal quotation marks omitted.) Id., 260.</p>\n<p id=\"b360-5\">Moreover, at least two state courts expressly have declined to apply <em>Schneckloth </em>in the context of a \u201cknock and talk\u201d search, which has been described as a \u201cfashionable . . . alternative to obtaining a search warrant when police officers do not have sufficient probable cause to obtain a search warrant. What generally occurs is that several law enforcement officers accost a home dweller on the doorstep of his or her home and request consent to search that home. If an oral consent is given, the search proceeds. What is found by police officers may then form the basis for probable cause to obtain a search warrant and result in the subsequent seizure of contraband.\u201d (Internal quotation marks omitted.) <em>State </em>v. <em>Brown, </em>356 Ark. 460, 466, 156 S.W.3d 722 (2004). Thus, in <em>State </em>v. <em>Ferrier, </em>136 Wash. 2d 103, 115, 118-19, 960 P.2d 927 (1998), and <em>State </em>v. <em>Brown, </em>supra, 472-74, the Supreme Court of Washington and the Supreme Court of Arkansas, respectively, held that the use of the \u201cknock and talk\u201d investigative technique is unconstitutional when the police fail to inform the subject of his or her right to refuse consent.</p>\n<p id=\"b360-6\">In <em>Ferrier, </em>the Supreme Court of Washington concluded that, under article I, \u00a7 7, of the Washington constitution,<footnotemark>18</footnotemark> as a prerequisite for a valid knock and talk <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"341\">*341</page-number>search, the resident must be \u201cadvised, prior to giving her consent to the search of her home, that she could refuse to consent.\u201d <em>State </em>v. <em>Ferrier, </em>supra, 136 Wash. 2d 115. The court observed: \u201c[A]ny knock and talk is inherently coercive to some degree. . . . [T]he great majority of home dwellers confronted by police officers on their doorstep or in their home would not question the absence of a search warrant because they either (1) would not know that a warrant is required; (2) would feel inhibited from requesting its production, even if they knew of the warrant requirement; or (3) would simply be too stunned by the circumstances to make a reasoned decision about whether or not to consent to a warrantless search.\u201d Id. To mitigate the coercive effects of the knock and talk, the court concluded that \u201cofficers who conduct the procedure [must] warn home dwellers of their right to refuse consent to a warrantless search. This would provide greater protection for privacy rights that are protected by the state constitution and would also accord with the state\u2019s [f]ourth [amendment burden of demonstrating, by clear and convincing evidence, that consent to a search was voluntarily given.\u201d Id., 116. The court further observed that \u201cthe only sure way to give [the right to refuse consent] substance is to require a warning of its existence. If we were to reach any other conclusion, we would not be satisfied that a home dweller who consents to a war-rantless search possessed the knowledge necessary to make an informed decision. That being the case, the [s]tate would be unable to meet its burden of proving that a knowing and voluntary waiver occurred.\u201d Id., 116-17; see <em>State </em>v. <em>Brown, </em>supra, 356 Ark. 470-72 (adopting <em>Ferrier, </em>among other cases, for purposes of <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"342\">*342</page-number>article two, \u00a7 15,<footnotemark>19</footnotemark> of Arkansas constitution);<footnotemark>20</footnotemark> see also <em>State </em>v. <em>Brown, </em>supra, 466 (\u201c [i]t is the intimidation effect of multiple police officers appearing on a home dweller\u2019s doorstep, sometimes in uniform and armed, and requesting consent to search without advising the home dweller of his or her right to refuse consent that presents the constitutional problem\u201d).</p>\n<p id=\"b362-5\">Although it is axiomatic that the \u201cphysical entry of the home is the chief evil against which the wording of the [fjourth [a]mendment is directed\u201d; <em>United States </em>v. <em>United States District Court, </em>407 U.S. 297, 313, 92 S. Ct. 2125, 32 L. Ed. 2d 752 (1972); the analysis of the coercive effect of the knock and talk investigative procedure involved in the foregoing cases also is applicable to a request by the police for consent to search following a routine traffic stop because of the inherently coercive nature of the latter type of encounter. Indeed, the Wyoming Supreme Court has observed that the atmosphere surrounding a traffic stop is more coercive than that attendant to the knock and talk encounter, stating that \u201cthe standards [that have been] . . . applied in [cases involving] premises searches \u2014 where the individual is on his or her own premises and likely <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"343\">*343</page-number>feels freer to turn law enforcement away \u2014 [are] even more applicable in the context of roadside vehicle searches \u2014 where the traveler has been stopped for a traffic offense and is not free to leave.\u201d <em>O\u2019Boyle </em>v. <em>State, </em>117 P.3d 401, 412 (Wyo. 2005).</p>\n<p id=\"b363-4\">As in <em>O\u2019Boyle, </em>several courts have taken notice of the coercion inherent in the routine traffic stop in crafting rules applicable to that factual scenario. For example, in <em>State </em>v. <em>Carty, </em>170 N.J. 632, 790 A.2d 903, modified, 174 N.J. 351, 806 A.2d 798 (2002), the court observed that, \u201c[i]n the context of motor vehicle stops, [in which] the individual is at the side of the road and confronted by a uniformed officer seeking to search his or her vehicle, it is not a stretch of the imagination to assume that the individual feels compelled to consent.\u201d Id., 644. Indeed, after analyzing scholarly articles and empirical data, the court observed that (1) detained motorists give consent approximately 95 percent of the time it is sought even though, in New Jersey, following the decision of the New Jersey Supreme Court in <em>State </em>v. <em>Johnson, </em>supra, 68 N.J. 349, police in New Jersey are required to inform motorists of their right to withhold consent, and (2) the vast majority of motorists subjected to consent searches following routine traffic stops are not charged with any wrongdoing. <em>State </em>v. <em>Carty, </em>supra, 645. As a result, the court in <em>Carty </em>concluded that, despite its holding in <em>Johnson, </em>\u201cconsent searches following valid motor vehicle stops are either not voluntary because people feel compelled to consent for various reasons, or are not reasonable because of the detention associated with obtaining and executing the consent search.\u201d<footnotemark>21</footnotemark> Id., 646.</p>\n<p id=\"b364-4\"><page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"344\">*344</page-number>Although other courts have not expressly adopted the rule articulated in <em>Carty, </em>they nevertheless have identified the coercive effects of a request for consent to search following a routine traffic stop. For example, in <em>Brown </em>v. <em>State, </em>supra, 182 P.3d 624, the Alaska Court of Appeals observed that \u201cmotorists who have been stopped for traffic infractions do not act from a position of psychological independence when they decide how to respond to a police officer\u2019s request for a search. Because of the psychological pressures inherent in the stop, and often because of the motorist\u2019s ignorance of [his or her] rights, large numbers of motorists \u2014 guilty and innocent alike \u2014 accede to these requests.\u201d Id., 626. The court in <em>Brown </em>further observed that, \u201c[i]n all but exceptional cases . . . consent searches [following routine traffic stops] are held to be valid under the [fjourth [a]mendment. The federal law in this area is premised on the assumption that, all things being equal, a motorist who does not wish to be subjected to a search will refuse consent when the officer seeks permission to conduct a search. But experience has shown that this assumption is wrong.\u201d Id., 630. The court concluded: \u201cMotorists are giving consent in such large numbers that it is no longer reasonable to believe that they are making the kind of independent decision that lawyers and judges typically have in mind when they use the phrase \u2018consent search\u2019.\u201d Id., 631; see also <em>Commonwealth </em>v. <em>Strickler, </em>563 Pa. 47, 73, 757 A.2d 884 (2000) (\u201c[the] element of coercion [inherent in all interactions between a uniformed police officer and a citizen] is obviously enhanced when police actually detain a citizen, albeit lawfully, for some period of time, by means of <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"345\">*345</page-number>a traffic or similar stop\u201d); <em>Commonwealth </em>v. <em>Strickler, </em>supra, 74 (in determining whether encounter following conclusion of routine traffic stop is consensual, courts cannot \u201cdiscount the fact that there remains at work some pertinent psychological dynamic based [on] the relative positions of authority as between the officer and a citizen-subject, and an immediately-preceding exercise of the officer\u2019s authority\u201d).</p>\n<p id=\"b365-5\">Finally, although many state courts have adopted the <em>Schneckloth </em>standard under their respective state constitutions, I am more persuaded by the thoughtful dissenting opinions that have been issued in many of those cases. For example, in <em>Commonwealth </em>v. <em>Cleckley, </em>supra, 558 Pa. 517, the Supreme Court of Pennsylvania concluded that article I, \u00a7 8, of the Pennsylvania constitution does not require the subject of a consent search to be informed of his or her right to refuse to consent. See id., 527. The court, relying on (1) the fact that most states apply <em>Schneckloth </em>for purposes of their own constitutions, and (2) the lack of local policy issues indicating that a departure from the federal standard is needed; id., 526-27; concluded that \u201cthe federal volun-tariness standard as enunciated in <em>Schneckloth </em>adequately protects the privacy rights obtained under [a]rticle I, [\u00a7] 8 of [the Pennsylvania] constitution.\u201d Id., 527.</p>\n<p id=\"b365-6\">In his dissent, Justice Russeli M. Nigro concluded \u201cthat when police seek consent to perform an otherwise unconstitutional search, they should be required under . . . the Pennsylvania constitution to expressly advise the subject of the search that he or she has the right to refuse to give consent and that any refusal will be respected.\u201d Id., 528 (Nigro, J., dissenting). In reaching this conclusion, Justice Nigro stated that \u201cthe majority . . . ignore[d] the practical impact that a police officer\u2019s request for consent to search has on the average citizen.\u201d Id., 530 (Nigro, J., dissenting). Relying on both <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"346\">*346</page-number><em>State </em>v. <em>Johnson, </em>supra, 68 N.J. 349, and Justice Marshall\u2019s dissent in <em>Schneckloth, </em>Justice Nigro concluded that, \u201c[i]f a person believes [that] he has no choice but to consent upon an officer\u2019s request, then that person\u2019s consent cannot be said to have been given voluntarily, much less knowingly and intelligently. The safeguard advocated by [the] [a]ppellant \u2014 a simple statement by the police that the subject of the search has the lawful right to withhold consent to search \u2014 would serve to protect not only those who are unaware of their rights, but also those who, although perhaps aware of their rights, become too intimidated to refuse what can readily be perceived as an official demand.\u201d <em>Commonwealth </em>v. <em>Cleckley, </em>supra, 558 Pa. 530-31 (Nigro, J., dissenting). Lastly, Justice Nigro rejected the majority\u2019s assertion that the commonwealth of Pennsylvania would be prejudiced if it was required to inform suspects of their rights before seeking consent to search: \u201cThere is . . . little reason to believe, as the <em>Schneckloth </em>[c]ourt apparently did, that the requirement of informed consent would reduce the number of consent searches obtained by the police. It has not occurred with the [f]ifth [a]mendment waiver even in the wake of <em>Miranda, </em>and there is no reason to expect [that] it will occur in the face of the requirement to inform of the right to refuse a consent to search. Many cases hinge on confessions, despite the <em>Miranda </em>warning requirement. Although somewhat different considerations are often present in a confession situation, such as the prior arrest of the defendant, and thus more than mere suspicion exists at that point, there is little cause to believe that warnings of the right to refuse to consent to search will, in any great degree, cause a vast reduction in the number of consent searches.\u201d (Internal quotation marks omitted.) Id., 531 (Nigro, J., dissenting).</p>\n<p id=\"b366-5\">Likewise, in <em>State </em>v. <em>Flores, </em>supra, 280 Or. 273, the Supreme Court of Oregon concluded that the Oregon <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"347\">*347</page-number>constitution provides no greater protection than the federal constitution for purposes of consent searches.<footnotemark>22</footnotemark> See id., 282. That case, in which the court implicitly overruled a prior Oregon Supreme Court decision that predated <em>Schneckloth </em>and required the police to inform the subject of the encounter of his or her right to withhold consent; see id., 276-77, 281; was predicated on (1) the reasoning of <em>United States </em>v. <em>Watson, </em>423 U.S. 411, 96 S. Ct. 820, 46 L. Ed. 2d 598 (1976);<footnotemark>23</footnotemark> see <em>State </em>v. <em>Flores, </em>supra, 281; (2) the absence \u201cof any unique local conditions, such as widespread police misconduct infringing suspects\u2019 rights against unreasonable searches and seizures, that would require a different rule under the state constitution\u201d; id.; and (3) the perceived need for a \u201cuniform\u201d standard, \u201cparticularly when state and law enforcement agencies collaborate . . . .\u201d<footnotemark>24</footnotemark> Id.</p>\n<p id=\"b367-5\">In his dissent, Justice Hans A. Linde noted the then existing criticism of <em>Schneckloth </em>and explained that the <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"348\">*348</page-number>reasoning of <em>Schneckloth </em>was \u201crejected ... by the experts who prepared the [Mjodel Code of Pre-Arraignment Procedure for the American Law Institute, and by the [American Law Institute] in approving that code. The [American Law] [Institute adopted the position that before undertaking a search on the basis of consent, an officer must inform the individual whose consent is sought that he need not consent and that anything found may be used as evidence .... [I]n short, the [American Law] [Institute would treat [the] waiver of the protection of a search warrant the same as [the] waiver of the right to remain silent.\u201d<footnotemark>25</footnotemark> Id., 285-86 (Linde, J., dissenting). Justice Linde also observed that, as the drafters of the Model Code of Pre-Arraignment Procedure explained in its accompanying commentary, there is a greater need for warnings in the context of a consent search than in the context of a custodial interrogation because, \u201cby the consent search the officer is seeking to short-circuit another means available to him \u2014 the use of a warrant \u2014 to obtain evidence. No such alternative exists with respect to information sought by interrogation. It seems far less justifiable to omit the protection of the warning when, by the very act of seeking consent, the officer is depriving the person from whom it is sought of the protective screening <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"349\">*349</page-number>of judicial involvement in the issuance of the warrant.\u201d (Internal quotation marks omitted.) Id., 286 (Linde, J., dissenting). Declining to adopt fully the American Law Institute\u2019s position, Justice Linde was persuaded by the approach that the New Jersey Supreme Court had taken in <em>Johnson </em>and concluded that warnings are not constitutionally required as long as the state could show that consent was given with the knowledge that it could be withheld. Id., 287-88 (Linde, J., dissenting). Dissenting justices of other state courts also have recognized the inherently coercive nature of the encounter between a police officer and motorist subject to a traffic stop. See, e.g., <em>Salmeron </em>v. <em>State, </em>280 Ga. 735, 739, 632 S.E.2d 645 (2006) (Sears, C. J., dissenting) (disagreeing with decision of majority not to impose reasonable suspicion requirement for consent searches and noting that \u201c[t]raffic stops are inherently time-consuming and coercive events providing ample opportunity for interrogations\u201d and that \u201c[mjost citizens naturally feel compelled to submit to any request from a police officer who has already seized them for some other legal violation\u201d); <em>State </em>v. <em>Akuba, </em>686 N.W.2d 406, 426 (S.D. 2004) (Sabers, J., dissenting) (\u201cAn honest appraisal ofthe typical traffic stop must [lead] to the conclusion that it is an inherently coercive situation in which very few citizens understand their constitutional protections. ... A citizen pulled over to the side of the road and brought to a trooper\u2019s car would not feel free to terminate the encounter and carry on with their business. . . . Therefore, the encounter is inherently coercive and an officer should be required to meet a threshold evidentiary standard before requesting such consent.\u201d [Citations omitted; internal quotation marks omitted.]).</p>\n<p id=\"b369-5\">Ultimately, I am not convinced by the reasoning of those courts that have adopted <em>Schneckloth </em>as the governing standard for purposes of their state constitutions. Indeed, those courts generally have not engaged <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"350\">*350</page-number>in any substantive analysis of the rationale underlying the court\u2019s holding in <em>Schneckloth. </em>Moreover, they simply do not address the pervasive criticism that has been directed at Schneckloth.<footnotemark>26</footnotemark> As Justice Linde observed in his dissenting opinion in <em>Flores, </em>the extent of the protections of our constitution \u201cis not answered by the [decision] in <em>Schneckloth </em>.... It cannot be answered by the Supreme Court of the United States but only by [the Supreme Court of Oregon]. Obviously, if [this] case had arisen before <em>Schneckloth . . . </em>this court would have had to form its own judgment. It does not escape that responsibility after Schneckloth.\u201d (Citations omitted.) <em>State </em>v. <em>Flores, </em>supra, 280 Ore. 285 (Linde, J., dissenting). For this reason, I am persuaded by the dissenting opinions in those cases because I believe that they properly account for the coercion inherent in routine traffic stops that was overlooked by the majority in <em>Schneckloth.</em></p>\n<p id=\"b370-5\">IV</p>\n<p id=\"b370-6\">ECONOMIC AND SOCIOLOGICAL CONSIDERATIONS</p>\n<p id=\"b370-7\">In my view, these considerations support the conclusion that the police should be required to advise a motorist that he or she has a right to withhold consent <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"351\">*351</page-number>to search following a routine traffic stop. Public trust in the police is likely to be enhanced if they are required to provide motorists with such an advisement, and the empirical evidence indicates that the vast majority of motorists who are warned of their right to withhold consent will continue to grant consent despite the warning. Indeed, it is especially important that a motorist be advised of his or her right to refuse consent when, as in the present case, the police officer lacks even a reasonable and articulable suspicion that the vehicle contains contraband; in such circumstances, a request for consent is no more than a fishing expedition pursuant to which the police are able to take advantage of the coercive nature of the encounter and, in many cases, the subject\u2019s lack of knowledge that he or she has the legal right to withhold consent without any resultant adverse consequences.</p>\n<p id=\"b371-5\">V</p>\n<p id=\"b371-6\">CONCLUSION</p>\n<p id=\"b371-7\">Upon review of the <em>Geisler </em>factors, I conclude that article first, \u00a7 7, of the Connecticut constitution provides greater protection than the federal constitution with respect to consent searches undertaken in connection with routine traffic stops. For the foregoing reasons, I am not persuaded by the analysis of <em>Schneckloth </em>and its progeny; the view that the police must inform motorists of their right to withhold consent, although the minority position, is considerably more persuasive. Indeed, by and large, those courts that have adopted the standard articulated in <em>Schneckloth </em>have failed to engage in any real analysis of the rationale underlying the court\u2019s holding in that case. Cf. <em>State </em>v. <em>Thompson, </em>supra, 284 Kan. 779-80 (observing that scholarly criticism of <em>Schneckloth </em>\u201cis valid in many respects\u201d and that, if the court were free to adopt different rule, it \u201cwould consider a different paradigm,\u201d but also noting <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"352\">*352</page-number>that it was not free to depart from <em>Schneckloth </em>in light of prior Kansas decisions concluding that Kansas constitution\u2019s analogue to fourth amendment was coextensive with federal constitution). I therefore am convinced that, for purposes of article first, \u00a7 7, of the state constitution, a motorist\u2019s consent to search following a routine traffic stop should not be deemed voluntary unless the motorist has been informed of his or her right to withhold consent.<footnotemark>27</footnotemark> In essence, I see no reason for this court to abandon its prior precedent concerning the standard for an effective waiver of a constitutional right. \u201c [ W] e have adopted the definition of a valid waiver of a constitutional right as the intentional relinquishment or abandonment of a known right.\u201d (Internal quotation marks omitted.) <em>State </em>v. <em>Gore, </em>288 Conn. 770, 776, 955 A.2d 1 (2008); accord <em>State </em>v. <em>Ouellette, </em>271 Conn. 740, 752, 859 A.2d 907 (2004). Having repeatedly characterized this standard as a \u201cstrict\u201d one; <em>State </em>v. <em>Gore, </em>supra, 776; accord <em>State </em>v. <em>Ouellette, </em>supra, 752; we also have explained that \u201c[a]n effective waiver presupposes full knowledge of the right or privilege allegedly waived and some act done designedly or knowingly to relinquish it. . . . Moreover, the waiver must be accomplished with sufficient awareness of the relevant circumstances and likely consequences.\u201d (Citations omitted; internal quotation marks omitted.) <em>State </em>v. <em>Ramos, </em>201 Conn. 598, 603, 519 A.2d 9 (1986); cf. <em>State </em>v. <em>Madera, </em>210 Conn. 22, 48, 554 A.2d 263 (1989) (\u201c[c]ourts <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"353\">*353</page-number>indulge every reasonable presumption against waiver of fundamental constitutional rights . . . [and] do not presume acquiescence in the loss of fundamental rights\u201d [internal quotation marks omitted]).</p>\n<p id=\"b373-5\">Applying these principles to the present case, I conclude that the defendant was not properly informed of his right to withhold consent. Although the state asserts that the defendant volunteered permission to search before consent was sought, and, consequently, there was no need for Morgan to inform the defendant of his right to withhold consent, I agree with the defendant that he reasonably construed Morgan\u2019s inquiry about whether the vehicle contained anything illegal as demonstrating Morgan\u2019s interest in searching the vehicle. Indeed, prior to asking the defendant about the contents of his vehicle, Morgan asked him whether he had anything illegal on his person; when the defendant responded in the negative, Morgan patted him down. In such circumstances, the defendant reasonably would have believed that Morgan intended to search the vehicle \u2014 an intent that Morgan readily and candidly acknowledged.<footnotemark>28</footnotemark> Thus, because the defendant was not informed of his right to refuse to consent to a search of his vehicle, I respectfully dissent.</p>\n<footnote label=\"1\">\n<p id=\"b328-5\"> I disagree with Justice Katz that the defendant inadequately briefed his claim that Morgan\u2019s search of his vehicle violated his rights under the state constitution on the ground that Morgan had failed to advise the defendant that he had a right not to consent to the search of his vehicle.</p>\n</footnote>\n<footnote label=\"2\">\n<p id=\"b329-6\"> I agree with the majority that the record is inadequate for review of the defendant\u2019s claim that Morgan\u2019s patdown search of the defendant was unlawful and, further, that Morgan\u2019s conduct in obtaining the defendant\u2019s consent to search did not violate the fourth amendment to the United States constitution. Finally, I also agree with the majority that, in contrast to the view expressed by Justice Katz in her dissenting opinion, it was not improper under the state constitution for Morgan to seek the defendant\u2019s consent to search despite his lack of reasonable and articulable suspicion to do so, at least in the absence of evidence indicating an abuse of the use of consent searches following routine traffic stops by the police. Thus, in my view, the search violated article first, \u00a7 7, of the state constitution not because Morgan sought the defendant\u2019s consent to search his vehicle but, rather, because Morgan had failed to advise the defendant that he had the right to refuse to consent to such a search.</p>\n</footnote>\n<footnote label=\"3\">\n<p id=\"b330-6\"> This court first articulated the importance of considering these factors for purposes of state constitutional analysis in <em>State </em>v. <em>Geisler, </em>supra, 222 Conn. 684-85, and, consequently, they often are referred to as the <em>Geisler </em>factors.</p>\n</footnote>\n<footnote label=\"4\">\n<p id=\"b331-7\"> See footnote 3 of this opinion.</p>\n</footnote>\n<footnote label=\"5\">\n<p id=\"b331-8\"> Because <em>Schneckloth </em>is the seminal case concerning consent searches following routine traffic stops, it is necessary to discuss the case in some detail.</p>\n</footnote>\n<footnote label=\"6\">\n<p id=\"b338-6\"> In reaching this conclusion, Justice Marshall explained that \u201cthe phrase Voluntary consent\u2019 seems redundant in a way that the phrase Voluntary confession\u2019 does not.\u201d <em>Schneckloth </em>v. <em>Bustamonte, </em>supra, 412 U.S. 280 n.6 (Marshall, J., dissenting). Relying on <em>Miranda, </em>Justice Marshall asserted that, \u201c[b]ecause of the nature of the right to be free of compulsion, it would be pointless to ask whether a defendant knew of it before he made a <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"319\">*319</page-number>statement; no sane person would knowingly relinquish a right to be free of compulsion. Thus, the questions of compulsion and of violation of the right itself are inextricably intertwined. The cases involving coerced confessions, therefore, pass over the question of knowledge of that right as irrelevant, and turn directly to the question of compulsion.\u201d Id., 281 (Marshall, J., dissenting). Justice Marshall further asserted that, although \u201cwe would not ordinarily think that a suspect could waive his right to be free of coercion, for example, we do permit suspects to waive the rights they are informed of by police warnings, on the belief that such information in itself sufficiently decreases the chance that a statement would be elicited by compulsion. . . . Thus, nothing the defendant did in [any case] involving coerced confessions was taken to operate as a relinquishment of his rights; certainly the fact that the defendant made a statement was never taken to be a relinquishment of the right to be free of coercion.\u201d (Citation omitted.) Id., 281-82 (Marshall, J., dissenting).</p>\n<p id=\"b339-6\">By contrast, Justice Marshall explained, the <em>Schneckloth </em>case did not involve the right to be free from police misconduct of the kind implicated by a coerced confession but, rather, the issue of consent. Id., 282 (Marshall, J., dissenting). Justice Marshall further observed that the two concepts are different because freedom from coercion is a substantive, constitutional right, whereas consent \u201cis a mechanism by which substantive requirements, otherwise applicable, are avoided.\u201d Id. Thus, the substantive requirement of the fourth amendment is that searches may be conducted only on the basis of a properly issued warrant supported by probable cause. See id. Justice Marshall further asserted that, although there are exceptions to this requirement, they are justified by the overriding needs of law enforcement, which are applicable when consent is the sole justification for a search. Id., 282-83 (Marshall, J., dissenting). Indeed, Justice Marshall explained that \u201cthe needs of law enforcement are significantly more attenuated, for probable cause to search may be lacking but a search permitted if the subject\u2019s consent has been obtained. Thus, consent searches are permitted, not because such an exception to the requirements of probable cause and warrant is essential to proper law enforcement, but because we permit our citizens to choose whether . . . they wish to exercise their constitutional rights.\u201d Id., 283 (Marshall, J., dissenting).</p>\n</footnote>\n<footnote label=\"7\">\n<p id=\"b340-6\"> \u201cWhen a prosecutor seeks to rely [on] consent to justify the lawfulness of a search, he has the burden of proving that the consent was, in fact, freely and voluntarily given. This burden cannot be discharged by showing no more than acquiescence to a claim of lawful authority. A search conducted in reliance [on] a warrant cannot later be justified on the basis of consent if it turns out that the warrant was invalid.

(Internal quotation marks omitted.) <em>State </em>v. <em>Kearns, </em>75 Haw. 558, 564, 867 P.2d 903 (1994). The court explained the practice as follows: \u201c[T]he Honolulu [pjolice [department] . . . utilizes a walk and talk drug interdiction program in order to arrest drug smugglers and to seize any narcotics [that] they might be carrying on their persons or in their luggage. This walk and talk program does not employ any type of drug courier profile or require the officers to have a reasonable suspicion that a person may be in possession of illegal drugs . . . or . . . engaged in criminal activity. Instead, [officers] are trained to engage in consensual encounters whereby airline passengers are approached and in a conversational manner, [are] requested to consent to a search of their luggage or person.\u201d (Internal quotation marks omitted.) Id.</p>\n</footnote>\n<footnote label=\"16\">\n<p id=\"b358-9\"> It must be noted that, in <em>Kearns, </em>the court stated that, for purposes of a consent search, the police are <em>not </em>required to inform the person whose <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"339\">*339</page-number>consent to search is sought that he or she has the right to refuse consent. <em>State </em>v. <em>Kearns, </em>supra, 75 Haw. 570. The court explained that, \u201c[a]lthough this rule is appropriate in the context of searches [when] the scope of the search is generally well-defined and limited to a particular item or area at the time consent is given, it is not equally applicable to seizures\u201d; id.; including the \u201cwalk and talk\u201d encounter. The court, however, failed to offer any meaningful explanation as to why it is constitutionally necessary for the police to advise the subject of a \u201cwalk and talk\u201d encounter of his or her right to refuse to speak to the police, on the one hand, and why it is not constitutionally necessary for the police to advise a person of his or her right to withhold consent to a search, on the other. Indeed, it is particularly difficult to ascertain the reason for any such distinction when, as in the present case, the police do not even have reasonable suspicion that the person from whom consent to search is sought is in possession of contraband. Thus, I disagree with the court in <em>Kearns </em>that its rationale for requiring the police to advise the subject of a \u201cwalk and talk\u201d encounter is not equally applicable to a case involving a consent to search. Cf. <em>State </em>v. <em>Robinette, </em>supra, 80 Ohio St. 3d 244 (\u201cThe transition between detention and a consensual exchange can be so seamless that the untrained eye may not notice that it has occurred. The undetectability of that transition may be used by police officers to coerce citizens into answering questions that they need not answer, or to allow a search of a vehicle that they are not legally obligated to allow.\u201d [Internal quotation marks omitted.]).</p>\n</footnote>\n<footnote label=\"17\">\n<p id=\"b359-6\"> See footnote 15 of this opinion.</p>\n</footnote>\n<footnote label=\"18\">\n<p id=\"b360-7\"> Article I, \u00a7 7, of the Washington constitution, Washington\u2019s analogue to the fourth amendment, provides: \u201cNo person shall be disturbed in his private affairs, or his home invaded, without authority of law.\u201d As the court in <em>Ferrier </em>observed, \u201c[t]his provision differs from the [f]ourth [a]mendment in that [u]nlike the [f]ourth [ajmendment, [the Washington constitution] clearly recognizes an individual\u2019s right to privacy with no express limitations.\u201d (Internal quotation marks omitted.) <em>State </em>v. <em>Ferrier, </em>supra, 136 Wash. 2d 110.</p>\n</footnote>\n<footnote label=\"19\">\n<p id=\"b362-6\"> Article two, \u00a7 15, of the Arkansas constitution provides: \u201cThe right of the people of this State to be secure in their persons, houses, papers, and effects, against unreasonable searches and seizures, shall not be violated; and no warrant shall issue, except upon probable cause, supported by oath or affirmation, and particularly describing the place to be searched, and the person or thing to be seized.\u201d As the court in <em>Brown </em>observed, this provision is almost identical to the fourth amendment to the United States constitution. <em>State </em>v. <em>Brown, </em>supra, 356 Ark. 467.</p>\n</footnote>\n<footnote label=\"20\">\n<p id=\"b362-7\"> In reaching its conclusion, however, the court in <em>Brown </em>distinguished its automobile search jurisprudence.

The right to refuse is a fact crucially pertinent to an understanding consent and, if there is the slightest doubt that the person in question is not aware of his right, and no such information is given [to] him, the police are eliciting consent on the basis of withheld information. It is hard to describe such conduct as other than deceptive, or the [c]ourt\u2019s decision [in <em>Schneckloth] </em>as other than retrograde.\u2019 \u201d <em>State </em>v. <em>Rodgers, </em>supra, 119 Wis. 2d 119-20 n.3 (Abrahamson, J., dissenting).</p>\n</footnote>\n<footnote label=\"26\">\n<p id=\"b370-8\"> For example, in <em>State </em>v.

The very nature of a consent search differs from the other exceptions to the warrant requirement; a subject approached regarding a consent search is presumed free to decline the request. . . .</p>\n<p id=\"b370-9\"><em>\u201cSchneckloth </em>remains the minority rule despite the occasional efforts to scuttle it.

I do not agree with this approach because it is important that the subject be made aware that the police are prepared to honor the subject\u2019s decision to refuse consent and that no adverse consequences will befall the subject upon such a refusal. Unless the police warn the subject of his or her right to refuse consent, there remains the risk that the subject will feel compelled to agree to the search out of concern for how the police will react to a decision to withhold consent.</p>\n</footnote>\n<footnote label=\"28\">\n<p id=\"b373-6\"> As I previously indicated, I agree with the majority\u2019s conclusion that the record is inadequate to review the defendant\u2019s separate claim that the patdown search was illegal. The fact that Morgan conducted a patdown search of the defendant, however, is relevant to the issue of whether the defendant reasonably would have considered Morgan\u2019s subsequent inquiry regarding the presence of contraband in the vehicle as indicative of Morgan\u2019s intent to search the vehicle.</p>\n</footnote>\n</opinion>\n</casebody>\n",
