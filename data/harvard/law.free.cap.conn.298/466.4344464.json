Lestorti, Jr.,<footnotemark>2</footnotemark> appeals from the judgment of the Appellate Court, which affirmed the trial court\u2019s decision to grant the motion of the plaintiff, James C. Lestorti, to strike the defendant\u2019s counterclaim for equitable contribution. <em>Lestorti </em>v. <em>DeLeo, </em>114 Conn. App. 50, 51, 57, 968 A.2d 941 (2009). On appeal to this court, the defendant claims that the Appellate Court\u2019s decision (1) conflicts with well established Connecticut law concerning the rights of coguarantors to contribution, and (2) is improperly based on an assumption of a fact that is not part of the record. We reverse the judgment of the Appellate Court.</p>\n<p id=\"b488-8\">The following relevant facts and procedural history are set forth in the opinion of the Appellate Court. \u201cIn April, 2006, the plaintiff instituted an action in multiple counts alleging, inter alia, fraud against the defendant, among others. That action subsequently was transferred to the Complex Litigation Docket in the judicial district of Hartford. On February 23,2007, the defendant <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"469\">*469</page-number>filed a counterclaim, alleging a cause of action for equitable contribution.</p>\n<p id=\"b489-5\">\u201cIn his counterclaim, the defendant alleged the following facts. In a guaranty agreement dated June 11, 2001 . . . the plaintiff, the defendant and [Otto Paparazzo and OJP Development Corporation] each agreed jointly and severally to guaranty the liability of Pond Place Development II, LLC (Pond Place), to First Union National Bank under anote in the amount of $7,875,000.<footnotemark>3</footnotemark> The note was secured by a mortgage. On or about August 31, 2004, Wachovia Bank, N.A. (Wachovia),<footnotemark>4</footnotemark> the successor to First Union National Bank, commenced a foreclosure action against, inter alia, Pond Place, the principal obligor, and the plaintiff and the defendant, secondary obligors, under the terms of the guaranty agreement. This foreclosure action arose out of a default on the promissory note. Although both the plaintiff and the defendant were initially named as defendants in the foreclosure action by virtue of their joint and several liability on the guaranty, the action was dismissed on May 3, 2006, as to the plaintiff because Wachovia [had] failed to make proper service on him. The defendant was found to be liable for the amount of the deficiency judgment.</p>\n<p id=\"b489-6\">\u201cWhen the court rendered judgment of strict foreclosure [on August 8, 2005], it found that the debt [owed] to Wachovia, not including fees and costs, was $2,400,834.96 and that [on the basis of appraisals] the <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"470\">*470</page-number>value of the property being foreclosed was $295,000. [Neither the plaintiff nor the defendant redeemed the property in connection with the foreclosure action. Thus, on December 12,2005, titled vested in Wachovia.] To avoid the substantial risk of liability for a much larger deficiency judgment, the defendant negotiated and settled Wachovia\u2019s deficiency claim for $275,000 by virtue of a stipulated deficiency judgment. Subsequently, the defendant paid Wachovia $275,000 and obtained a satisfaction of judgment. In his counterclaim, the defendant alleged that, as a joint obligor under the guaranty of the promissory note, the plaintiff was liable to him for $137,500, [which represents] the plaintiffs proportionate and equitable share of the defendant\u2019s payment to satisfy the deficiency judgment.</p>\n<p id=\"b490-5\">\u201cOn April 13,2007, the plaintiff filed a motion to strike the defendant\u2019s counterclaim. The plaintiff argued that, as a matter of law, the defendant had no right of contribution against him because the deficiency judgment rendered in the foreclosure action, for which the defendant sought contribution, was not a joint obligation. The defendant subsequently filed an objection to the motion to strike.</p>\n<p id=\"b490-6\">\u201cOn October 10, 2007, the [trial] court granted the plaintiffs motion to strike the defendant\u2019s counterclaim. The court noted that the plaintiff and the defendant had been jointly hable on the guaranty of the note underlying the . . . mortgage but that liability was extinguished by the foreclosure obtained by Wachovia. The court concluded that because only the defendant was hable for the deficiency judgment, and the plaintiff was not, the defendant had no equitable right to contribution from the plaintiff for a portion of that deficiency judgment.\u201d Id., 51-53.</p>\n<p id=\"b490-7\">Thereafter, the trial court rendered judgment for the plaintiff on the defendant\u2019s counterclaim, from which <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"471\">*471</page-number>the defendant appealed to the Appellate Court. Id., 51. In his appeal to the Appellate Court, the defendant claimed that the trial court improperly had concluded that he had no right to equitable contribution from the plaintiff because the plaintiff was not liable under the deficiency judgment. Id., 53. The Appellate Court disagreed. Id. In its decision, the Appellate Court concluded that Wachovia\u2019s failure to obtain personal jurisdiction over the plaintiff in the foreclosure action impaired the defendant\u2019s right to contribution from the plaintiff, and, therefore, under the principles set forth in the Restatement (Third) of Suretyship and Guaranty, \u201cWachovia . . . was not entitled to collect from the defendant an amount greater than the defendant\u2019s con-tributive share of the guaranty, in this case, half.\u201d Id., 56. Thus, the Appellate Court determined that the defendant was not entitled to reimbursement from the plaintiff for any amount. The Appellate Court concluded that, \u201cto the extent, if any, that the defendant\u2019s settlement with Wachovia reflected any payment of the plaintiffs obligation to Wachovia, the payment was gratuitous.\u201d Id. The Appellate Court further determined that \u201cthe defendant\u2019s contributive share was presumptively half of the obligation, which, at the time of the deficiency judgment, was more than $1,050,000. [The defendant\u2019s] payment of $275,000 would not appear in the circumstances to be anything other than a portion of his own contributive share. Under either rationale, the defendant is not entitled to reimbursement from the plaintiff.\u201d Id. Finally, the Appellate Court determined that \u201cthe defendant is not entitled to restitution on a theory of unjust enrichment because the plaintiff, being effectively discharged from his obligation to [Wachovia by virtue of General Statutes \u00a7 49-1],<footnotemark>5</footnotemark> owed nothing at the <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"472\">*472</page-number>time of the defendant\u2019s payment and thus was not enriched, justly or otherwise, by the defendant\u2019s payment.\u201d Id. Accordingly, the Appellate Court affirmed the judgment of the trial court. Id., 57. This certified appeal followed.</p>\n<p id=\"b492-5\">Before addressing the defendant\u2019s claims, we set forth the applicable standard of review. \u201cThe standard of review in an appeal challenging a trial court\u2019s granting of a motion to strike is well established. A motion to strike challenges the legal sufficiency of a pleading, and, consequently, requires no factual findings by the trial court. As a result, our review of the court\u2019s ruling is plenary. . . . We take the facts to be those alleged in the [pleading] that has been stricken and we construe the [pleading] in the manner most favorable to sustaining its legal sufficiency.\u201d (Internal quotation marks omitted.) <em>Sullivan </em>v. <em>Lake Compounce Theme Park, Inc., </em>277 Conn. 113, 117, 889 A.2d 810 (2006).</p>\n<p id=\"b492-6\">The defendant\u2019s first claim is that the Appellate Court\u2019s decision conflicts with well established Connecticut law concerning a coguarantor\u2019s right of contribution when the coguarantor has made a payment on a joint obligation. Specifically, the defendant claims that the right of contribution between coguarantors is based on equitable principles and the theory of implied contract and, therefore, arises from the relationship between the coguarantors alone, and not the relationship between the creditor and the coguarantors. The defendant argues, on the basis of this principle, that it is irrelevant to the defendant\u2019s right of contribution that Wachovia failed to serve the plaintiff properly in the <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"473\">*473</page-number>foreclosure action. The defendant claims that the Appellate Court\u2019s decision conflicts with this principle because that court attached significance to the fact that Wachovia was barred by \u00a7 49-1 from continuing to enforce the note against the plaintiff. We agree.</p>\n<p id=\"b493-5\">We begin our analysis by setting forth the legal principles that govern the right of contribution between cogu-arantors. Under Connecticut law, the right of contribution between coguarantors is based on the theory of implied contract. <em>Waters </em>v. <em>Waters, </em>110 Conn. 342, 345, 148 A. 326 (1930). When two or more persons guarantee the debt of another, they simultaneously enter into \u201can implied promise on the part of each to contribute his share if necessary to meet the common obligation.\u201d Id., 346. \u201c[T]his right is an existing obligation running from the inception of the relation[ship] . . . .\u201d Id. Nevertheless, \u201cits enforcement does not accrue . . . until the actual payment of the common debt.\u201d Id.</p>\n<p id=\"b493-6\">The only parties to this implied contract are the cogu-arantors. The creditor is <em>not </em>a party. Indeed, \u201c[t]he creditor has nothing to do with the right of the [coguar-antors] for contribution among themselves, and has no right to do any act tending to impair it.\u201d 18 Am. Jur. 2d 42, Contribution \u00a7 32 (2004). Accordingly, \u201cthe discharge of one [coguarantor\u2019s] direct liability to the [creditor] will not relieve [him or her] from his or her liability to contribute to the other [coguarantors] . . . whether the discharge results from contract or from operation of law.\u201d Id., pp. 41-42. In addition, \u201cthe fact that a creditor sues only some of several [coguarantors], or recovers judgment against fewer than all of them, does not excuse those not sued or not included in the judgment from paying their part of the joint debt. Accordingly, as a rule, one or more of the [coguarantors] against whom the judgment is recovered may, upon paying the creditor, compel contribution from all other [coguarantors].\u201d Id., \u00a7 35, p. 44.</p>\n<p id=\"b494-4\"><page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"474\">*474</page-number>A coguarantor, however, is not entitled to contribution for <em>any </em>amount paid to the creditor toward the common debt. Rather, under Connecticut law, a guarantor\u2019s right of contribution from a coguarantor arises only when the guarantor \u201chas paid in excess of <em>his share of the whole [outstanding] </em>obligation,\u201d and the amount of contribution he is entitled to collect is limited to \u201cthe amount he has paid <em>in excess of his share of the whole [outstanding] </em>obligation.\u201d<footnotemark>6</footnotemark> (Emphasis added.) <em>Waters </em>v. <em>Waters, </em>supra, 110 Conn. 345. The reason for this limitation is that, in Connecticut, \u201c[a] guarantor, as between himself and his co-guarantors, is a principal for the portion of the debt which he ought to pay and is a surety [or secondary obligor] for the remainder . . . .\u201d <em>Bristol Bank &amp; Trust Co. </em>v. <em>Broderick, </em>122 Conn. 310, 315, 189 A. 455 (1937). Thus, when a coguarantor has made a payment to the creditor in an amount that is <em>less than his share of the whole </em>outstanding<footnotemark>7</footnotemark> <em>obliga-</em><page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"475\">*475</page-number><em>lion, </em>he has <em>no right to contribution </em>from the other coguarantors.</p>\n<p id=\"b495-5\">This rule is echoed in the Restatement (Third) of Suretyship and Guaranty,<footnotemark>8</footnotemark> which provides in relevant part that a cosurety is not entitled to contribution unless it pays more than its contributive share because, \u201c[a]s between cosureties for the same underlying obligation, each cosurety is a principal obligor to the extent of its contributive share . . . and a secondary obligor as to the remainder of its duty pursuant to its secondary obligation.\u201d<footnotemark>9</footnotemark> Restatement (Third), Suretyship and Guar<page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"476\">*476</page-number>anty \u00a7 55 (1), p. 236 (1996); see also id., illustration 1, p. 237.<footnotemark>10</footnotemark> Many other authorities also support this rule. See, e.g., 74 Am. Jur. 2d 148, Suretyship \u00a7 172 (2001) (\u201c[when] one of two or more sureties for the same obligation has paid <em>more than his share of the debt, </em>he is entitled to contribution . . . for <em>the excess paid over his </em>share\u201d [emphasis added]); id., \u00a7 176, p. 151 (\u201cThe right of a surety to contribution does not arise until he has paid <em>more than his proportion of the debt </em>.... [Therefore, a surety who has paid less than his ratable share cannot enforce contribution, even against his cosureties <em>who have paid </em>nothing.\u201d [Emphasis added.]); id., \u00a7 177 (\u201cIf a surety satisfies the full demand of the creditor, thereby discharging all the sureties, by paying less than the whole amount, he is entitled to contribution from his cosureties to reimburse him <em>for what he has paid in excess of his part. </em>However, one who pays nothing in excess of his share of the debt to the common creditor <em>may not enforce contribution </em>from another surety who settles at a discount, there being no further liability on the part of either.\u201d [Emphasis added.]); 38A C.J.S. 763-64, Guaranty \u00a7 161 (2008) (\u201cThe right of a guarantor to contribution is limited to the amount by which the guarantor\u2019s actual payment of the . . . debt exceeds his . . . fair share. Thus, for example, when one of two guarantors . . . pays three-quarters of the debt, the guarantor may seek contribution for an amount over and above his . . . share, <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"477\">*477</page-number>namely one-quarter of the debt; however, if the guarantor instead satisfies one-quarter of the debt, the guarantor would not have [an] action for contribution because he . . . has not paid more than his . . . fair share of the common burden.\u201d); 38A C.J.S. 767, supra, \u00a7 165 (\u201c[t]here must be some form of payment of an amount more than the proportionate share of the guarantor who has paid in order to permit him to obtain contribution\u201d); 23 S. Williston, Contracts (4th Ed. 2002) \u00a7 61:65, p. 236 (\u201cthe right [to contribution] arises as soon as, but not before, the cosurety has paid anything in excess of the share which, as between itself and its cosureties, it ought to bear\u201d).<footnotemark>11</footnotemark></p>\n<p id=\"b499-4\"><page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"479\">*479</page-number>The Restatement (Third) of Suretyship and Guaranty also contains provisions that are intended to protect the interests of secondary obligors in the event that the creditor \u201cacts to increase the secondary obligor\u2019s risk of loss by increasing its potential cost of performance or decreasing its potential ability to cause the principal obligor to bear the cost of performance .... [Such] [a]n act . . . is [called] an \u2018impairment of suretyship status.\u2019 \u201d Restatement (Third), supra, \u00a7 37, p. 157. In general, if a creditor acts in such a manner as to impair the suretyship status of a secondary obligor, the secondary obligor\u2019s duties are discharged to the extent of the impairment. See generally id., \u00a7\u00a737 through 39, pp. 157-58, 163, 168. A somewhat analogous rule in the context of negotiable instruments is codified at General Statutes \u00a7 42a-3-605.<footnotemark>12</footnotemark> The Appellate Court\u2019s decision <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"480\">*480</page-number>in the present case discusses two examples of the rule contained in the Restatement (Third) of Suretyship and Guaranty. See <em>Lestorti </em>v. <em>DeLeo, </em>supra, 114 Conn. App. 54-55. First, if a creditor releases the principal obligor from its duties pursuant to the underlying obligation, the secondary obligor is discharged from its duties pursuant to the secondary obligation <em>unless the rights of the secondary obligor to recourse against the principal obligor are preserved. </em>See Restatement (Third), supra, <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"481\">*481</page-number>\u00a7\u00a738 through 39, pp. 163,168; cf. General Statutes \u00a7 42a-3-605 (b) (\u201c[discharge ... of the obligation of a party to pay an instrument does not discharge the obligation of an endorser or accommodation party having a right of recourse against the discharged party\u201d). Second, if a creditor allows the statute of limitations to expire as to the principal obligor, \u201cthe secondary obligor\u2019s rights and duties with respect to the principal obligor and the [creditor] are the same as if . . . the [creditor] has released the principal obligor from its duties . . . without preserving the secondary obligor\u2019s recourse against the principal obligor.\u201d Restatement (Third), supra, \u00a7 43, p. 195. Under the Restatement (Third) of Suretyship and Guaranty, in order to preserve the secondary obli-gor\u2019s right of recourse against the principal obligor, the creditor must include express language to that effect in its release of the principal obligor. See id., \u00a7 38 (1), p. 163. Under Connecticut law, however, no such requirement exists because the secondary obligor\u2019s right of recourse against the principal obligor is automatically preserved by virtue of the fact that we apply the implied contract theory to the right of contribution. As we previously discussed, under an implied contract theory, a creditor cannot unilaterally impair the right of contribution between coguarantors because the creditor is not a party to the contract. Because the right of contribution is not affected by the creditor\u2019s actions, a guarantor\u2019s duties are not discharged when the creditor releases a coguarantor or allows the statute of limitations to expire as to a coguarantor.</p>\n<p id=\"b501-5\">In the present case, the Appellate Court concluded that Wachovia\u2019s failure to properly serve and obtain personal jurisdiction over the plaintiff in the foreclosure action, and subsequent inability to obtain a deficiency judgment against him pursuant to General Statutes \u00a7 49-1, \u201c[f]unctionally . . . allowed a limitations period to expire against the plaintiff . . . .\u201d <em>Lestorti </em>v. <em>DeLeo, </em><page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"482\">*482</page-number>supra, 114 Conn. App. 55. The Appellate Court further concluded that \u201c[n]o right of recourse [was] applicable. Wachovia [thus] was not entitled to collect from the defendant an amount greater than the defendant\u2019s con-tributive share of the guaranty, in this case, half.\u201d Id., 56. Accordingly, the Appellate Court concluded that, \u201cto the extent, if any, that the defendant\u2019s settlement with Wachovia reflected any payment of the plaintiffs obligation to Wachovia, the payment was gratuitous.\u201d Id.</p>\n<p id=\"b502-5\">We conclude that the Appellate Court\u2019s conclusions were improper because (1) the court did not apply the theory of implied contract to the defendant\u2019s claim for contribution, and (2) they contradict the express terms of the parties\u2019 guaranty agreement. First, under the theory of implied contract, the defendant\u2019s right of recourse and, more specifically, his right of contribution from the plaintiff was not impaired by Wachovia\u2019s failure to obtain jurisdiction over the plaintiff in the foreclosure action because Wachovia was not a party to the implied contract between the plaintiff and the defendant and, therefore, could not unilaterally impair the right of contribution between them. See, e.g., 18 Am. Jur. 2d 42, supra, \u00a7 32. Because the defendant continued to have a right of recourse against the plaintiff, no part of the defendant\u2019s obligations to Wachovia was discharged as a result of Wachovia\u2019s actions or omissions. Accordingly, the Appellate Court\u2019s conclusion to the contrary was improper.</p>\n<p id=\"b502-6\">The Appellate Court\u2019s conclusions also contradict the express terms of the guaranty agreement between the parties and Wachovia. The guaranty agreement provided that Wachovia could, \u201cwithout impairing or releasing the obligations of [any] [guarantor . . . [a]dd, release, settle, modify or discharge the obligation of any . . . guarantor ... for any of the [liabilities\u201d or \u201c[t]ake any other action which might constitute a <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"483\">*483</page-number>defense available to, or a discharge of . . . any other . . . [guarantor . . . .\u201d Because the defendant contractually agreed that the release of a coguarantor would not result in a corresponding release of his own obligations under the guaranty agreement, the Appellate Court\u2019s conclusion to the contrary was improper.</p>\n<p id=\"b503-5\">The defendant\u2019s second claim is that the Appellate Court\u2019s decision is improperly based on an assumption of a fact that is not part of the record. As an alternative ground for affirming the trial court\u2019s decision to grant the plaintiffs motion to strike, the Appellate Court stated that \u201cthe defendant\u2019s contributive share was presumptively half of the obligation, which, at the time of the deficiency judgment, was more than $1,050,000. His payment of $275,000 would not appear in the circumstances to be anything other than a portion of his own contributive share. [Therefore] . . . the defendant is not entitled to reimbursement from the plaintiff.\u201d <em>Lest-orti </em>v. <em>DeLeo, </em>supra, 114 Conn. App. 56. The defendant claims that the Appellate Court\u2019s determination that, at the time of the deficiency judgment, the defendant\u2019s contributive share of the obligation was more than $1,050,000 is not supported by the allegations of his counterclaim or applicable law. The defendant argues that, although Wachovia may have <em>claimed </em>a deficiency of more than $2 million, no deficiency judgment ever was established in that amount, and, therefore, there was no basis in fact or law for the Appellate Court to conclude that the stipulated deficiency judgment of $275,000 was anything other than the full outstanding balance due on the note. We agree with the defendant that the Appellate Court improperly concluded that the defendant\u2019s contributive share of the outstanding obligation was more than $1,050,000. We disagree, however, with the defendant to the extent that he claims that the stipulated deficiency judgment either establishes or represents the full outstanding balance due on the note <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"484\">*484</page-number>for purposes of determining whether the defendant has paid more than his contributive share and, therefore, is entitled to contribution.</p>\n<p id=\"b504-5\">The defendant alleged in his counterclaim that, \u201c[o]n or about August 8,2005, the court [rendered] a judgment of strict foreclosure in the Pond Place action in favor of [Wachovia]. At the time of the judgment, the court found that the debt owing to [Wachovia], not including fees and costs, was $2,400,834.96 and that, based on [certain] appraisals, the value of the property being foreclosed was $295,000.\u201d The defendant further alleged that, \u201c[i]n order to avoid the substantial risk of liability for a much larger deficiency judgment, [the defendant] negotiated and settled [Wachovia\u2019s] deficiency claim for $275,000,\u201d and that, \u201con or about August 15, 2006, the court [rendered] a stipulated deficiency judgment [in accordance with the settlement] in the Pond Place action . . . .\u201d</p>\n<p id=\"b504-6\">We conclude that the Appellate Court improperly determined that the outstanding debt at the time of the deficiency judgment was the difference between $2,400,834.96 and $295,000, or approximately $2.1 million. The rule of law in Connecticut since 1833, when Connecticut first enacted a deficiency judgment statute, is that, in order to determine the amount of any deficiency owed after a judgment of strict foreclosure, the value of the property foreclosed on must be determined <em>as of the date title vested in the foreclosing plaintiff </em>See, e.g., <em>Eichman </em>v. <em>J &amp; J Building Co., </em>216 Conn. 443, 449, 582 A.2d 182 (1990) (\u201c[t]he value of the premises on the date that title becomes vested in the mortgagee determines whether the mortgagee is entitled to a deficiency judgment\u201d [internal quotation marks omitted]); <em>Farmers &amp; Mechanics Savings Bank </em>v. <em>Durham Realty, Inc., </em>34 Conn. App. 204, 207, 640 A.2d 1017 (1994) (\u201cthe value of the property foreclosed shall be the actual value thereof as of the date when title vested <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"485\">*485</page-number>in the plaintiff under the foreclosure decree\u201d [internal quotation marks omitted]). In the present case, the defendant alleged in his counterclaim that the value of the foreclosed property was $295,000 <em>as of August 8, 2005, </em>the date on which the court rendered the judgment of strict foreclosure. The counterclaim, however, does not allege the value of the property <em>as of December 12, 2005, </em>the date on which title vested in Wachovia. In addition, because Wachovia settled with the defendant rather than seeking a deficiency hearing pursuant to General Statutes \u00a7 49-14 (a),<footnotemark>13</footnotemark> the trial court never made a finding as to the value of the foreclosed property as of December 12, 2005. We therefore do not have sufficient facts to determine definitively the amount of the outstanding debt based on the value of the foreclosed property as of December 12, 2005, and thus whether any portion of the defendant\u2019s payment of $275,000 exceeded his share of the whole outstanding obligation. Accordingly, we conclude that the Appellate Court improperly affirmed the trial court\u2019s decision to grant the plaintiffs motion to strike the defendant\u2019s counterclaim.</p>\n<p id=\"b505-5\">Nonetheless, we disagree with the defendant to the extent that he claims that the stipulated deficiency judgment either establishes or represents the full outstanding balance due on the note for purposes of determining whether the defendant has paid more than his contribu-<page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"486\">*486</page-number>tive share and, therefore, is entitled to contribution. In the present case, the amount of the deficiency or outstanding obligation was never litigated by the defendant or Wachovia, or determined by the trial court in the foreclosure action. Rather, the defendant and Wachovia agreed to settle Wachovia\u2019s claim against the defendant in the amount of $275,000. Moreover, the defendant expressly alleged in his counterclaim that, \u201c[i]n order to avoid the substantial risk of liability for <em>a much larger deficiency judgment, </em>[the defendant] negotiated and settled [Wachovia\u2019s] deficiency claim for $275,000.\u201d (Emphasis added.) Thus, the defendant acknowledges in his counterclaim that the outstanding deficiency was actually \u201cmuch larger\u201d than $275,000. Accordingly, we disagree with the defendant to the extent that he claims that the settlement amount was judicially determined to be the full outstanding balance due on the note merely because the trial court, at the request of the defendant and Wachovia, rendered a stipulated judgment in accordance with the settlement agreement. In any event, we note that the plaintiff could not be collaterally estopped from litigating the value of the outstanding balance of the note in the present case because that issue was not litigated in the foreclosure action and the plaintiff was not a party to that action. See <em>Lafayette </em>v. <em>General Dynamics Corp., </em>255 Conn. 762, 772, 770 A.2d 1 (2001) (\u201c [collateral estoppel . . . prohibits the relitigation of an issue when that issue was <em>actually litigated </em>and <em>necessarily determined </em>in a prior action <em>between the same parties </em>upon a different claim\u201d [emphasis altered; internal quotation marks omitted]).</p>\n<p id=\"b506-5\">As a final matter, we conclude that, in order for a coguarantor to state a claim for contribution, he must allege that he has paid more than his contributive share of the whole outstanding obligation. The defendant\u2019s counterclaim does not contain such an allegation. Nevertheless, in light of the fact that the defendant did not <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"487\">*487</page-number>have the benefit of our decision in the present case when he drafted his counterclaim and the fact that the plaintiff did not raise this ground in his motion to strike, we decline to affirm the Appellate Court\u2019s judgment on this alternative ground. See <em>Meredith </em>v. <em>Police Commission, </em>182 Conn. 138, 140-41, 438 A.2d 27 (1980) (declining to affirm trial court\u2019s decision to strike complaint on ground of nonjoinder of necessary party, when such ground was not raised by defendant in motion to strike). On remand, the defendant shall be given an opportunity to replead the necessary allegations in accordance with this decision.</p>\n<p id=\"b507-5\">In order to recover any amount of contribution from the plaintiff, the defendant will have the burden of proving that he has paid more than his contributive share of the whole outstanding obligation to Wachovia. The defendant thus must prove that the value of the subject property as of December 12, 2005, was not $295,000 but, rather, was greater than $1,850,834.96,<footnotemark>14</footnotemark> such that the deficiency or whole outstanding obligation was less than $550,000.<footnotemark>15</footnotemark> Although it may be unlikely that the defendant will be able to make such an allegation in a revised counterclaim or eventually prove his claim, we conclude that the defendant should be afforded a fair opportunity to do so.</p>\n<p id=\"b507-6\">The judgment of the Appellate Court is reversed and the case is remanded to that court with direction to reverse the judgment of the trial court and to remand <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"488\">*488</page-number>the case to the trial court for further proceedings according to law.</p>\n<p id=\"b508-5\">In this opinion KATZ and McLACHLAN, Js., concurred.</p>\n<footnote label=\"1\">\n<p id=\"b488-9\"> We granted the petition of the defendant Louis A.

The following illustration demonstrates how to calculate a party\u2019s contributive share and right to contribution under Connecticut law: <em>A </em>loans <em>B </em>$1000. <em>C </em>and <em>D </em>each agree to equally guarantee the debt. <em>B </em>subsequently repays $200 to <em>A </em>and, thereafter, becomes insolvent. At this point, the outstanding debt is $800, which represents the full amount of the debt ($1000) less the amount that <em>B </em>had paid ($200). Therefore, the contributive shares of C and <em>D </em>are each one half of the amount of the outstanding debt ($800), or $400. Thus, if <em>A </em>sues <em>G, </em>and <em>C </em>settles and discharges the entire outstanding debt by <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"475\">*475</page-number>paying <em>A </em>$600, then <em>C </em>has a right of contribution against <em>D </em>in the amount of $200, which represents the amount of money <em>C </em>had paid in excess of his share of the outstanding debt.</p>\n</footnote>\n<footnote label=\"8\">\n<p id=\"b495-9\"> We previously have relied on the Restatement (Third) of Suretyship and Guaranty to fill gaps in and support our common law.

See footnote 11 of this opinion. The theory behind the law of joint tortfeasor liability is not even remotely the same in theory or development as that of the law of suretyship. Finally, even if we were to <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"476\">*476</page-number>adopt the theory espoused by Chief Justice Rogers, it would be for the first time and, therefore, would affect numerous existing guarantees that are still in force.</p>\n</footnote>\n<footnote label=\"10\">\n<p id=\"b496-6\"> Illustration 1 in the Restatement (Third) of Suretyship and Guaranty, \u00a7 55, provides in relevant part: \u201cP borrows $1,000 from C.

Thus, Si has a right of contribution against S2 to the extent that Si has liability to C in excess of $600. Similarly, S2 has a right of contribution against Si to the extent that S2 has liability to C in excess of $400.\u201d</p>\n</footnote>\n<footnote label=\"11\">\n<p id=\"b497-5\"> Chief Justice Rogers, in her concurring and dissenting opinion, does not appear to express a view regarding this rule but nonetheless concludes, on the basis of an exception to this rule contained in \u00a7 82 of the Restatement of the Law of Restitution that the defendant is entitled to contribution from the plaintiff for one half of the $275,000 that the defendant had paid to Wachovia in satisfaction of the deficiency judgment. The Restatement of the Law of Restitution provides in relevant part that, <em>the payor </em>secures a full release from the creditor . . . [he] is entitled to contribution although the amount thus paid is less than what was originally his proportionate share.\u201d (Emphasis added.) Restatement, Restitution \u00a7 82, comment (b) (1937). The rationale for this rule is that, <em>if the payor </em>has conveyed a benefit on the nonpaying coobligor, the payor is entitled to restitution to prevent the nonpaying coobligor from becoming unjustly enriched. See, e.g., <em>New Hartford </em>v. <em>Connecticut Resources Recovery Authority, </em>291 Conn. 433, 460, 970 A.2d 592 (2009) (restitution is remedy for upjust enrichment). Connecticut law has yet to adopt this exception, and we conclude that this is not an appropriate case to consider whether to do so because the facts in the present case do not fall within the exception. In the present case, the trial court found that the plaintiff was released from his obligations on the note by operation of \u00a7 49-1 <em>before the defendant made a payment to Wachovia. </em>Thus, the payor in this case, namely, the defendant, <em>did nothing </em>to secure the plaintiffs release from the creditor. Because the defendant did not confer any benefit on the plaintiff, there has been no uryust enrichment, and, therefore, this exception does not apply.</p>\n<p id=\"b497-6\">Chief Justice Rogers, in contravention of the language of the Restatement of the Law of Restitution, claims that the paying coobligor need not secure a full release from the creditor or confer any benefit on the nonpaying coobligor in order to be entitled to contribution for amounts paid that do not exceed the paying coobligor\u2019s contributive share when the nonpaying coobligor is released from his obligations by operation of law. In support of this argument, Chief Justice Rogers relies on 18 Am. Jur. 2d 16, supra, \u00a7 6, and the dissenting opinion in <em>Estate of Dresser </em>v. <em>Maine Medical Center, </em><page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"478\">*478</page-number>960 A.2d 1205, 1209 (Me. 2008) (Mead, X, dissenting). Neither of these sources, however, supports Chief Justice Rogers\u2019 claim.</p>\n<p id=\"b498-5\">The second edition of American Jurisprudence provides in relevant part that \u201c[cjontribution actions are based [on] principles of natural justice, which require that persons under a common burden bear responsibility in equal proportions and that one party not be required to bear more than his or her just share <em>to the advantage of his or her co-obligors.\" </em>(Emphasis added.) When a nonpaying coobligor, like the plaintiff in this case, is released from his obligations by operation of law, <em>he reaps no advantage </em>from the paying coobligor\u2019s payment to the creditor. 18 Am. Jur. 2d 16, supra, \u00a7 6. Thus, \u00a7 6 does not support Chief Justice Rogers\u2019 claim.</p>\n<p id=\"b498-6\">Chief Justice Rogers\u2019 reliance on <em>Estate of Dresser </em>also is misplaced. Unlike the present case, <em>Estate of Dresser </em>involved the right of contribution between <em>joint tortfeasors, </em>as opposed to coobligors. See <em>Estate of Dresser </em>v. <em>Maine Medical Center, </em>supra, 960 A.2d 1206. In addition, <em>Estate of Dresser </em>does not discuss the Restatement of the Law of Restitution and does not conclude that a coobligor who has paid less than his contributive share is entitled to contribution when the nonpaying coobligor is released from his obligations by operation of law. Rather, that case discusses whether Maine should adopt \u00a7 23 of the Restatement (Third) of Torts, Apportionment of Liability, which requires extinguishment of claims by joint tortfeasors as a precondition for a contribution action. Restatement (Third), Torts, Apportionment of Liability \u00a7 23, p. 284 (2000); see <em>Estate of Dresser </em>v. <em>Maine Medical Center, </em>supra, 1207-1208. <em>Estate of Dresser, </em>therefore, has no relevance to the facts or issues in the present case.</p>\n<p id=\"b498-7\">Finally, we note that, regardless of whether we adopt the unique interpretation of the exception contained in \u00a7 82 of the Restatement of the Law of Restitution, as Chief Justice Rogers urges, the defendant\u2019s allegations in his counterclaim are insufficient to invoke that exception because the defendant has not alleged that he had secured a full release from Wachovia, <em>that the plaintiff otherwise had been released from his obligations on the note, </em>or that the defendant had conferred any benefit on the plaintiff resulting in the plaintiffs unjust enrichment. When we review an appeal from a trial court\u2019s decision on a motion to strike, \u201cour analysis is . . . limited only to those well-pleaded facts and those facts necessarily implied from the allegations . . . .\u201d (Internal quotation marks omitted.) <em>Coalition for Justice in Education Funding, Inc. </em>v. <em>Rell, </em>295 Conn. 240, 262 n.20, 990 A.2d 206 (2010). Rather than looking solely at the allegations in the counterclaim, however, Chief Justice Rogers bases her analysis and conclusions wholly on the trial court\u2019s acceptance of a stipulated fact submitted by the parties, namely, that the plaintiff was released from his obligations on the note by operation of \u00a7 49-1. Although this could be appropriate in the context of a motion for summary judgment, it is not appropriate in the context of a motion to strike. \u201c[A] motion to strike challenges the legal sufficiency <em>of a pleading </em>and, consequently, requires <em>no factual findings by the trial court </em>. . . .\u201d (Emphasis added.) Id., 252. Because the defendant\u2019s counterclaim, even when construed liberally and viewed in the broadest manner possible, is devoid of any allegations that invoke the exception, there is no basis to apply it in the present case.</p>\n</footnote>\n<footnote label=\"12\">\n<p id=\"b499-5\"> General Statutes \u00a7 42a-3-605 provides: \u201c(a) In this section, the term \u2018endorser\u2019 includes a drawer having the obligation described in section 42a-3414(d).</p>\n<p id=\"b499-6\">\u201c(b) Discharge, under section 42a-3-604, of the obligation of a party to pay an instrument does not discharge the obligation of an endorser or accommodation parly having a right of recourse against the discharged party.</p>\n<p id=\"b499-7\">\u201c(c) If a person entitled to enforce an instrument agrees, with or without consideration, to an extension of the due date of the obligation of a party to pay the instrument, the extension discharges an endorser or accommodation party having a right of recourse against the party whose obligation is extended to the extent the endorser or accommodation party proves that the extension caused loss to the endorser or accommodation party with respect to the right of recourse.</p>\n<p id=\"b499-8\">\u201c(d) If a person entitled to enforce an instrument agrees, with or without consideration, to a material modification of the obligation of a party other than an extension of the due date, the modification discharges the obligation of an endorser or accommodation party having a right of recourse against the person whose obligation is modified to the extent the modification causes loss to the endorser or accommodation party with respect to the right of recourse.

In apparent recognition of this principle, the Restatement of Restitution has recognized an exception to the rule that a cosurety is entitled to contribution only when he has paid more than his contributive share when the other coguarantors have been released from their obligation.

In support of this conclusion, it quotes this court\u2019s statement in <em>Waters </em>v. <em>Waters, </em>110 Conn. 342, 345, 148 A. 326 (1930), that, under Connecticut law, a guarantor\u2019s right of contribution from a coguarantor arises only when the guarantor \u201chas paid in excess of <em>his share of the whole [outstanding] </em>obligation.\u201d (Emphasis added.) The majority also quotes this court\u2019s statement in <em>Bristol Bank &amp; Trust Co. </em>v. <em>Broderick, </em>122 Conn. 310, 315, 189 A. 455 (1937), that \u201c[a] guarantor, as between himself and his co-guarantors, is a principal for the portion of the debt which he ought to pay and is a surety [or secondary obligor] for the remainder . . . .\u2019\u2019On the basis of these statements, the majority concludes that it is settled under Connecticut law that, \u201cwhen a coguarantor has made a payment to the creditor in an amount that is <em>less than his share of the whole outstanding obligation, </em>he has <em>no right to contribution </em>from the other coguarantors.\u201d (Emphasis in original.) Even if the majority\u2019s interpretation of <em>Waters </em>is correct,<footnotemark>8</footnotemark> however, <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"493\">*493</page-number>that case simply does not address the situation where a coguarantor has paid less than his contributive share and the obligations of the other coguarantors have been released or discharged by operation of law.</p>\n<p id=\"b513-5\">I see no equitable or policy reasons why, if two coguarantors are jointly and severally liable to an obligee, and one coguarantor pays less than his contributive share and the other coguarantor pays nothing because his obligation to the obligee has been discharged by operation of law, we should maintain the legal fiction that the nonpaying coguarantor was not jointly liable for the amount paid for purposes of equitable contribution. Rather, I believe that it is more equitable to allow the paying coguarantor to seek equitable contribution under these circumstances; see <em>Estate of Dresser </em>v. <em>Maine Medical Center, </em>supra, 960 A.2d 1207-1208 (plaintiff was entitled to contribution from defendant even though injured party\u2019s claims against defendant had not been formally released because claims were barred by statute of limitations);<footnotemark>9</footnotemark> provided that the other coguarantor has an opportunity to raise any defenses that he or the paying coguarantor could have raised in an action on the common obligation. See 18 Am. Jur. 2d 100, supra, \u00a7 86 (\u201c[sjince the right to contribution is based on equitable principles, the fact that <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"494\">*494</page-number>the plaintiff was guilty of bad faith in defending a suit on the common obligation, whereby the defendant was deprived of opportunity to assert a defense thereto, is a good defense to the action for contribution\u201d). In the present case, the plaintiffs obligations to Wachovia were discharged by operation of General Statutes \u00a7 49-l.<footnotemark>10</footnotemark> Accordingly, I would conclude that the defendant was entitled to seek equitable contribution from him even if he paid less than his contributive share.</p>\n<p id=\"b514-5\">I concur with the majority\u2019s conclusion that we should reverse the judgment of the Appellate Court and remand the case to that court with direction to reverse the judgment of the trial court and to remand the case to the trial court for further proceedings. I disagree, however, that the defendant is entitled to contribution only for the amounts paid in excess of his contributive share of the outstanding debt. Instead, I would conclude that the defendant is entitled to equitable contribution of one half of the $275,000 that he paid to Wachovia in satisfaction of the deficiency claim, subject to any <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"495\">*495</page-number>defenses that the plaintiff could have raised in that action.</p>\n<footnote label=\"1\">\n<p id=\"b508-8\"> See footnote 2 of the majority opinion.</p>\n</footnote>\n<footnote label=\"2\">\n<p id=\"b508-9\"> The majority also concludes that the Appellate Court improperly concluded that the fact that the plaintiffs debt to Wachovia was discharged as the result of Wachovia\u2019s failure to serve the plaintiff in the foreclosure action meant that Wachovia was not entitled to collect from the defendant an amount greater than the defendant\u2019s contributive share and, therefore, any payment in excess of that amount was gratuitous. I agree with this conclusion.</p>\n</footnote>\n<footnote label=\"3\">\n<p id=\"b509-6\"> \u201cTo the extent that, as between themselves, one cosurety is a secondary obligor and the other is a principal obligor, the former has rights of contribution against the latter.

The majority concludes that, because, in the present case, the plaintiffs debt to Wachovia was discharged by operation of law and not as the result of the defendant\u2019s payment of the debt, the defendant has conferred no benefit on the plaintiff and, therefore, is not entitled to contribution. I disagree. Because I believe that coguarantors are \u201cunder a <em>common </em>burden\u201d and generally should \u201cbear responsibility in <em>equal proportions\" </em>for payments to the obligee; (emphasis added) 18 Am. Jur. 2d 16, supra, \u00a7 6; I believe that the best justification for the general rule that a coguarantor cannot seek contribution from the other coguarantors unless he has paid more than his contributive share is the prevention of double recoveries and multiple proceedings. This concern is allayed both when the nonpaying coguarantor has been released as the result of the paying coguarantor\u2019s actions and when he has been discharged by operation of law.</p>\n<p id=\"b511-6\">The majority points out that under 18 Am. Jur. 2d 16, supra, \u00a7 6, a paying coguarantor must show that he has acted \u201c \u2018to the advantage\u2019 \u201d of the nonpaying coguarantor and interprets this to mean that the coguarantor\u2019s actions must have reduced or eliminated the nonpaying coguarantor\u2019s actual liability to the creditor in order to obtain contribution. I disagree. Just as the majority concludes that, because a nonpaying coguarantor has implicitly agreed that he will reimburse the paying coguarantor for stuns paid in excess of the paying coguarantor\u2019s equitable share, a coguarantor who has paid more than his contributive share is entitled to contribution even if the nonpaying coguarantor has been discharged, I would conclude that, because a coguarantor has implicitly agreed that he will pay his proportionate share of any amounts that are paid to the creditor under the joint obligation, any payments by other coguarantors are to his \u201c \u2018advantage\u2019 \u201d under 18 Am. Jur. 2d 16, supra, \u00a7 6, regardless of whether the creditor could have recovered the amounts from the nonpaying coguarantor.</p>\n</footnote>\n<footnote label=\"7\">\n<p id=\"b511-7\"> See <em>Humphrey </em>v. <em>O\u2019Connor, </em>940 P.2d 1015, 1020 (Colo.

Under these circumstances, the plaintiffs contributive share of the outstanding debt and his proportionate share of the settlement amount were identical. Thus, as used in this court\u2019s statement that, \u201cif one debtor is compelled to pay the full amount of the debt, a right of contribution against the other at once arises for the amount he has paid in excess of his share of the whole obligation\u201d; id., 345; the phrase \u201chis share of the whole obligation\u201d could mean either the debtor\u2019s contributive share or his proportionate share of the amount paid.

Under <em>Estate of Dresser, </em>that fact can be established either by showing that C has been released from liability or that he has been discharged by operation of law.
