The plaintiffs claim on appeal that the trial court improperly concluded that the nursing homes did not constitute \u201c \u2018[a]partment property\u2019 \u201d under \u00a7 12-62n (a) (1) and, therefore, improperly upheld the board\u2019s classification.<footnotemark>4</footnotemark> We dis<page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"195\">*195</page-number>agree, and, accordingly, we affirm the judgment of the trial court.</p>\n<p id=\"b215-5\">The following facts, either found by the court or stipulated to by the parties,<footnotemark>5</footnotemark> and procedural history are relevant to this appeal. Each of the plaintiffs is the owner of a parcel of real estate in Hartford that is occupied by a nursing home.<footnotemark>6</footnotemark> The nursing homes are divided into residential rooms, most of which are occupied by two patients.<footnotemark>7</footnotemark> Each room contains bedroom furnishings and a bathroom with a sink and toilet, with central bathing facilities on each floor. The rooms do not contain a kitchen; each nursing home has a central kitchen that provides the patients with three meals a day. During their stay at the facility, patients receive full-time nursing and rehabilitative care from the nursing home staff.</p>\n<p id=\"b215-6\">Pursuant to \u00a7 12-62n, in 2006, the city adopted a system of real estate taxation in which the effective rate of taxation for a particular parcel depends on whether the property is classified as residential property, apartment property or commercial property. Under this system, commercial property is subjected to a substantially higher rate of taxation. For the purposes of the grand list of October 1, 2006, the city\u2019s tax assessor classified the plaintiffs\u2019 nursing homes as commercial property.</p>\n<p id=\"b215-7\">Pursuant to General Statutes \u00a7 12-111 (a),<footnotemark>8</footnotemark> the plaintiffs contested the tax assessor\u2019s classifications for their <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"196\">*196</page-number>respective properties by appealing them to the board. After a hearing, the board denied the plaintiffs\u2019 requests for a change in the classification of the nursing homes.</p>\n<p id=\"b216-5\">Thereafter, each plaintiff separately appealed from its respective 2006 assessment to the trial court pursuant to \u00a7 12-119, claiming that the board\u2019s classifications of the properties were illegal and its assessments manifestly excessive. See footnote 3 of this opinion. Prior to trial, the plaintiffs filed a motion to consolidate their two separate municipal tax appeals and also to bifurcate the trial into a classification phase and a valuation phase. The trial court granted the plaintiffs\u2019 motion.<footnotemark>9</footnotemark> Following a trial to the court on the classification issue, the trial court affirmed the board\u2019s classification of the nursing homes as commercial properties in a single memorandum of decision that applied to both of the plaintiffs and their respective properties, and, accordingly, entered one judgment. Thereafter, the parties entered into two stipulations regarding the valuation of the nursing homes, with the plaintiffs reserving their right to appeal the classification of the properties. The trial court rendered judgment consistent with the stipulations, and this single joint appeal followed. Additional facts will be set forth as necessary.</p>\n<p id=\"b216-6\">On appeal, the plaintiffs claim that the trial court improperly affirmed the board\u2019s decision, concluding that the nursing homes do not constitute \u201capartment property\u201d for purposes of \u00a7 12-62n (a) (1) because they do not contain \u201cdwelling units used for human habitation . . . .\u201d Specifically, the plaintiffs contend that the phrase \u201cdwelling units used for human habitation\u201d is broad and includes a nursing home, despite the provision of medical services at the nursing home. The plain<page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"197\">*197</page-number>tiffs also claim that the purpose of \u00a7 12-62n is furthered by the inclusion of nursing homes within the definition of apartment property. In response, the defendant asserts that the trial court properly affirmed the board\u2019s decision that the plaintiffs\u2019 nursing homes do not constitute apartment property. Specifically, the defendant claims that the language of \u00a7 12-62n and related statutes supports the trial court\u2019s conclusion that a nursing home is not an apartment property as defined in \u00a7 12-62n (a) (1). The defendant further claims that the trial court\u2019s conclusion is consistent with the legislative purpose behind \u00a7 12-62n. We agree with the defendant.</p>\n<p id=\"b217-5\">The issue of whether a nursing home is properly classified for tax assessment purposes as \u201capartment property\u201d under \u00a7 12-62n (a) (1) presents a question of statutory construction, over which we exercise plenary review. <em>Ziotas </em>v. <em>Reardon Law Firm, P.C., </em>296 Conn. 579, 587, 997 A.2d 453 (2010). \u201cThe process of statutory interpretation involves the determination of the meaning of the statutory language as applied to the facts of the case, including the question of whether the language does so apply. . . . When construing a statute, [o]ur fundamental objective is to ascertain and give effect to the apparent intent of the legislature. . . . [General Statutes] \u00a7 l-2z directs us first to consider the text of the statute itself and its relationship to other statutes. If, after examining such text and considering such relationship, the meaning of such text is plain and unambiguous and does not yield absurd or unworkable results, extratextual evidence of the meaning of the statute shall not be considered. . . . When a statute is not plain and unambiguous, we also look for interpretive guidance to the legislative history and circumstances surrounding its enactment, to the legislative policy it was designed to implement, and to its relationship to existing legislation and common law principles governing the same general subject matter .... A statute is ambiguous if, when <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"198\">*198</page-number>read in context, it is susceptible to more than one reasonable interpretation. . . . Additionally, statutory silence does not necessarily equate to ambiguity. . . .</p>\n<p id=\"b218-5\">\u201c[W]e are [also] guided by the principle that the legislature is always presumed to have created a harmonious and consistent body of law .... [T]his tenet of statutory construction . . . requires us to read statutes together when they relate to the same subject matter .... Accordingly, [i]n determining the meaning of a statute ... we look not only at the provision at issue, but also to the broader statutory scheme to ensure the coherency of our construction. . . . <em>Hatt </em>v. <em>Burlington Coat Factory, </em>263 Conn. 279, 310, 819 A.2d 260 (2003); <em>Felician Sisters of St. Francis of Connecticut, Inc. </em>v. <em>Historic District Commission, </em>284 Conn. 838, 850, 937 A.2d 39 (2008) ([T]he legislature is always presumed to have created a harmonious and consistent body of law .... [T]his tenet of statutory construction . . . requires [this court] to read statutes together when they relate to the same subject matter. . . .).\u201d (Citations omitted; internal quotation marks omitted.) <em>In re Jan Carlos D., </em>297 Conn. 16, 21-22, 997 A.2d 471 (2010). As a result, it is well settled that when two incongruent readings of a statute are equally plausible, the statute is ambiguous. See, e.g., <em>Fairchild Heights, Inc. </em>v. <em>Amaro, </em>293 Conn. 1, 9, 976 A.2d 668 (2009); <em>Hees </em>v. <em>Burke Construction, Inc., </em>290 Conn. 1, 12, 961 A.2d 373 (2009).</p>\n<p id=\"b218-6\">\u201cClaims that an assessor has misclassified property and, consequently, overvalued it, comprise a category of appeals frequently pursued under the aegis of \u00a7 12-119. See, e.g., <em>Pauker v. Roig, </em>232 Conn. 335, 338, 345, 654 A.2d 1233 (1995) (challenging property\u2019s assessment as subdivision lots instead of undivided parcel); <em>Fyber Properties Killingworth Ltd. Partnership </em>v. <em>Shanoff </em>228 Conn. 476, 477, 636 A.2d 834 (1994) (same); <em>Wysocki </em>v. <em>Ellington, </em>109 Conn. App. 287, 295-96, 951 <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"199\">*199</page-number>A.2d 598 (challenging assessor\u2019s failure to classify property as forest land), cert. denied, 289 Conn. 934, 958 A.2d 1248 (2008); <em>Saybrook Point Marina Partnership </em>v. <em>Old Saybrook, </em>49 Conn. App. 106, 109, 712 A.2d 980 (challenging property\u2019s assessment as condominium when still legally apartment building on date of assessment), cert. denied, 247 Conn. 904, 720 A.2d 515 (1998); <em>Stratford Arms Co. </em>v. <em>Stratford, </em>7 Conn. App. 496, 497-98, 508 A.2d 842 (1986) (same). In such cases, the determinative issue typically is whether, as a matter of law, the property at issue properly was subject to taxation as the type of property falling within the classification applied by the assessor. <em>See Stratford Arms Co. </em>v. <em>Strat-ford, </em>supra, 499. If the plaintiff can show that it was not, it necessarily follows that the resulting assessment was manifestly excessive. See, e.g., <em>Saybrook Point Marina Partnership </em>v. <em>Old Saybrook, </em>supra, 112-13 (remanding case for new trial on issues of assessment and valuation after concluding that property illegally was assessed as condominium); see also <em>Stratford Arms Co. </em>v. <em>Stratford, </em>supra, 502 (setting aside judgment upholding assessment of property as condominium and remanding case with direction to reinstate prior assessment as apartment building after concluding that property illegally was assessed as condominium); cf. <em>Timber Trails Associates </em>v. <em>New Fairfield, </em>226 Conn. 407, 413, 627 A.2d 932 (1993) (claim of improper declassification of forest land, coupled with allegation of thir-tyfold tax increase, cognizable under \u00a7 12-119).\u201d <em>Griswold Airport, Inc. </em>v. <em>Madison, </em>289 Conn. 723, 740-41, 961 A.2d 338 (2008).<footnotemark>10</footnotemark></p>\n<p id=\"b220-4\"><page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"200\">*200</page-number>Pursuant to \u00a7 l-2z, we begin with the text of the statute. Section 12-62n (c) provides in part: \u201cIn any municipality that adopts the property tax system under this section, the assessor shall determine a rate of assessment for apartment property and residential property for the assessment year in which a revaluation is effective, that will have the effect of increasing the average property tax as a result of revaluation for the property classes composed of apartment property and residential property, by three and one-half per cent over the property tax for said property classes in the base year. Tax increases on apartment property and residential property provided for in this subsection shall be used to reduce, in the amount derived from such increases, the surcharge under section 12-62d. ...\u201d Section 12-62n (a) (1) defines \u201c \u2018[a]partment property\u2019 \u201d as \u201ca building containing five or more dwelling units used for human habitation, the parcel of land on which such building is situated, and any accessory buildings or other improvements located on such parcel . . . .\u201d See footnote 1 of this opinion. The statute, however, neither defines nor provides any indication of what constitutes \u201cdwelling units used for human habitation . . . .\u201d General Statutes \u00a7 12-62n (a) (1) and (3).</p>\n<p id=\"b220-5\">\u201cIn the construction of the statutes, words and phrases shall be construed according to the commonly approved usage of the language; and technical words and phrases, and such as have acquired a peculiar and appropriate meaning in the law, shall be construed and understood accordingly.\u201d General Statutes \u00a7 1-1 (a). \u201cIf a statute or regulation does not sufficiently define a <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"201\">*201</page-number>term, it is appropriate to look to the common understanding of the term as expressed in a dictionary.\u201d (Internal quotation marks omitted.) <em>Heim </em>v. <em>Zoning Board of Appeals, </em>288 Conn. 628, 636, 953 A.2d 877 (2008).</p>\n<p id=\"b221-5\">The word \u201capartment\u201d is defined with substantial similarity in a number of dictionaries, each referring to use by an individual or a family for a residence. For example, the American Heritage Dictionary of the English Language (3d Ed. 1992) defines \u201capartment\u201d as \u201c[a] room or suite of rooms designed as a residence and generally located in a building occupied by more than one household ... [a] suite of rooms within a larger building set aside for a particular purpose or person.\u201d See also Random House Unabridged Dictionary (2d Ed. 1993) (defining \u201capartments\u201d as \u201ca set of rooms used as a dwelling by one person or one family\u201d); Black\u2019s Law Dictionary (6th Ed. 1990) (\u201capartment house\u201d means \u201c[a] building arranged in several suites of connecting rooms, each suite designed for independent housekeeping, but with certain mechanical conveniences, such as heat, light, or elevator services, in common to all persons occupying the building\u201d). These definitions do not seem applicable to a patient\u2019s room in a nursing home because the room is shared with another patient and it does not contain all the necessary elements of a residence, such as bathing and kitchen facilities.</p>\n<p id=\"b221-6\">Because the legislature chose to define \u201c \u2018[a]partment property\u2019 \u201d as a property containing \u201cdwelling units used for human habitation\u201d; General Statutes \u00a7 12-62n (a) (1); but did not define this phrase, we next turn to the dictionary to define the term \u201cdwelling.\u201d See, e.g., Black\u2019s Law Dictionary, supra (\u201cdwelling\u201d means \u201cthe apartment or building, or group of buildings, occupied by a family as a place of residence\u201d); Webster\u2019s Third New International Dictionary (\u201cdwelling\u201d means \u201ca <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"202\">*202</page-number>building or construction used for residence: abode, habitation\u201d); American Heritage Dictionary of the English Language, supra (\u201cdwelling\u201d means \u201c[a] place to live in; an abode\u201d); Random House Unabridged Dictionary, supra (\u201cdwelling\u201d means \u201ca building or place of shelter to live in; place of residence; abode; home\u201d).</p>\n<p id=\"b222-5\">We conclude, based on our textual analysis, that \u00a7 12-62n is not plain and unambiguous in that it is not clear from the language of the statute whether a patient\u2019s room in a nursing home constitutes a dwelling unit<footnotemark>11</footnotemark> used for human habitation within the meaning of \u00a7 12-62n (a) (l).<footnotemark>12</footnotemark> We, therefore, consult extratextual sources to determine the legislature\u2019s intent in adopting \u00a7 12-62n. General Statutes \u00a7 l-2z.</p>\n<p id=\"b222-6\">We first turn to the legislative history. Although our review of the legislative history of \u00a7 12-62n does not shed light on the precise issue of whether the legislature intended to include nursing homes within the classification of apartment property, we are nonetheless guided in a general sense by the purposes underlying this legislation. Representative Art Feltman, who represented <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"203\">*203</page-number>Hartford in the General Assembly, explained the impact of the proposed statute as follows: \u201cWhat this [b]ill does is enable the revaluation in Hartford, which has been delayed for two years, to go forward. It would [go] forward this year. It does provide some relief to <em>residents </em>from the full impact of revaluation. It provides for a margin of relief of only 3.5 [percent] per year, and it provides for relief for businesses in the amount of 6.5 [percent] in total. . . . This [a]mendment ... is the result of a cooperative effort between businesses and residents in Hartford. It is a sharing of the tax burden. It is a sharing of the shift resulting from revaluation.\u201d (Emphasis added.) 49 H. Proc., Pt. 20, 2006 Sess., pp. 6091-92. Representative Feltman further explained the purpose underlying the bill as follows: \u201cA major reason why the . . . Greater Hartford Chamber of Commerce is supporting this [b]ill and has been lobbying in favor of this [b]ill in the hallways is because it is the goal of everyone to increase the rate of [home ownership]. And home ownership only happens if homes are affordable, and the taxes are affordable, and in order to make sure, [to provide an incentive for] people to come to Hartford and to buy homes and to be owner-occupants, be it downtown or in the neighborhoods, we can\u2019t hit them with a 50 [percent] tax increase as soon as they get here.\u201d Id., pp. 6209-10. Representative Feltman\u2019s remarks make clear that the bill that became \u00a7 12-62n was intended to help individuals purchase homes in Hartford and then reside in them. This purpose is not furthered by including nursing homes within the definition of apartment property because the patients that reside in the nursing homes are not owners of the properties; they do not purchase the properties.<footnotemark>13</footnotemark> <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"204\">*204</page-number>Moreover, in the present case, the parties stipulated that the fees for 90 percent of the patients at the nursing homes are paid by medicaid<footnotemark>14</footnotemark> through the state department of social services at a rate that is based on an administrative formula. The fees for the remaining patients are paid either through the federal medicare program, private insurance or by payments from the assets of the patients. Although a component of the administrative formula used to assess fees for the medicaid residents is based on the municipal real estate tax paid by the nursing homes, the overwhelming majority of the patients of the nursing homes personally would not realize any savings from a change in the rates charged to medicaid. For both of these reasons, we conclude that including nursing homes within the classification of apartment property would not further the purpose of the legislation.</p>\n<p id=\"b224-5\">Returning to the text of \u00a7 12-62n with this legislative purpose in mind, we can see that the statute benefits two types of property: residential property and apartment property, both as defined in the statute, and both of which could be \u201cowner occupied,\u201d consistent with the intent of the statute. It seems highly unlikely that a nursing home would be owner occupied, and, therefore, giving a nursing home owner the tax benefit of \u00a7 12-62n would not be consistent with legislative intent. In addition, we note that the legislature chose to use the specific term \u201capartment property\u201d to describe one of the two types of property that benefit from \u00a7 12-62n. The legislature did not choose to employ any broader terms, such as \u201cmultifamily property\u201d or \u201cmultioccu-pant property,\u201d terms that might encompass the nursing homes, with their multioccupant rooms, that are at issue in the present appeal. The decision to use the term <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"205\">*205</page-number>\u201capartment\u201d in lieu of other terms thus suggests that the legislature intended the benefit of \u00a7 12-62n to apply only to buildings that contain apartments.</p>\n<p id=\"b225-5\">Other provisions in our statutes demonstrate that the legislature is aware that there are various types of different residential healthcare facilities and that it knows how to make specific reference to a \u201cnursing home\u201d when it intends to do so. For instance, the legislature has identified several types of residential healthcare facilities and included musing homes in the definition of \u201c \u2018[institutions\u2019 \u201d that are licensed by the state. See General Statutes \u00a7 19a-490 (a) (\u201c \u2018[institution\u2019 means a hospital, residential care home, health care facility for the handicapped, nursing home, rest home . . . substance abuse treatment facility\u201d). The text of \u00a7 19a-490 (a) thus indicates that the legislature knows how to use the specific term \u201cnursing home\u201d in our statutes when it intends to and thus suggests to us that its failure to use that term in \u00a7 12-62n was purposeful. See, e.g., <em>Windels </em>v. <em>Environmental Protection Commission, </em>284 Conn. 268, 299, 933 A.2d 256 (2007) (legislature knows how to convey its intent expressly).</p>\n<p id=\"b225-6\">Furthermore, in \u00a7 19a-490 (c), the legislature defined a \u201c \u2018nursing home\u2019 \u201d as \u201can establishment which furnishes, in single or multiple facilities, food and shelter to two or more persons unrelated to the proprietor and, in addition, provides services which meet a need beyond the basic provisions of food, shelter and laundry . . . .\u201d General Statutes \u00a7 19a-521 provides in relevant part: \u201c \u2018Nursing home facility\u2019 means any nursing home or residential care home as defined in section 19a-490 . . . which provides, in addition to personal care required in a residential care home, nursing supervision under a medical director twenty-four hours per day, or any chronic and convalescent nursing home which provides skilled nursing care under medical supervision and direction to carry out nonsurgical treatment and <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"206\">*206</page-number>dietary procedures for chronic diseases, convalescent stages, acute diseases or injuries . . . .\u2019\u2019By defining nursing home so as to include the provision of services beyond the basic needs of food and shelter, \u00a7\u00a7 19a-490 (c) and 19a-521 further demonstrate that the legislature generally understands that nursing homes are different from dwellings that are used for human habitation but that do not provide additional services, such as apartments.</p>\n<p id=\"b226-5\">This court never has addressed whether a nursing home constitutes an \u201capartment property\u201d or whether it contains dwelling units for purposes of \u00a7 12-62n. The Appellate Court, however, has addressed a similar issue, and it rejected the contention that a nursing home is a residential dwelling. In <em>Connecticut Light &amp; Power Co. </em>v. <em>Overlook Park Health Care, Inc., </em>25 Conn. App. 177, 593 A.2d 505 (1991), the Appellate Court considered whether a nursing home falls within the definition of \u201cresidential dwelling\u201d for purposes of General Statutes \u00a7 16-262e (c), which imposes liability on the \u201cowner, agent, lessor or manager of a residential dwelling . . . .\u201d The Appellate Court affirmed the trial court\u2019s determination that \u00a7 16-262e (c) did not apply to nursing homes because they do not constitute residential dwellings. <em>Connecticut Light &amp; Power Co. </em>v. <em>Overlook Park Health Care, Inc., </em>supra, 180. In doing so, the Appellate Court relied on the definition of a nursing home as a licensed institution that provides personal care, meals and nursing and medical supervision twenty-four hours a day, which is contained in \u00a7 19a-521. Id. The Appellate Court further concluded that \u201c[t]he trial court\u2019s determination that a building designed to provide food, shelter and total health care services to clients who pay a single fee for all of these services is not within the ambit of a residential dwelling for the purposes of \u00a7 16-262e (c) is both reasonable and logical.\u201d Id. Similarly, there is no dispute that the nursing homes in the present case <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"207\">*207</page-number>axe designed to provide food, shelter and medical services twenty-four hours a day for a single fee. Accordingly, <em>Connecticut Light &amp; Power Co. </em>supports the trial court\u2019s determination that a nursing home is not included within the classification of \u201c \u2018[a]partment property\u201d for purposes of \u00a7 12-62n.</p>\n<p id=\"b227-5\">We next turn to a decision from outside this jurisdiction that we find persuasive. In <em>McNeill </em>v. <em>Board of Assessors, </em>396 Mass. 603, 604, 487 N.E.2d 849 (1986), the Massachusetts Supreme Judicial Court concluded that the appellate tax board properly classified a nursing home as commercial, rather than residential, property for tax purposes. The classification statute at issue in <em>McNeill, </em>identical to the current version of the statute, defined residential property as \u201c \u2018property used or held for human habitation containing one or more dwelling units including rooming houses with facilities designed and used for living, sleeping, cooking and eating on a non-transient basis.\u2019 \u201d Id., 603 n.1; see Mass. Gen. Laws c. 59, \u00a7 2A (b) (1990). The statute continued onto define \u201ccommercial property\u201d as \u201cproperty used or held for use for business purposes and not specifically includible in another class, including but not limited to any . . . business . . . service . . . medical, or religious enterprise . . . .\u201d (Internal quotation marks omitted.) <em>McNeill </em>v. <em>Board of Assessors, </em>supra, 603-604 n.1; see Mass. Gen. Laws c. 59, \u00a7 2A (b) (1990).</p>\n<p id=\"b227-6\">The owners of the nursing home in <em>McNeill </em>asserted that the property fell within this definition of residential property because the nursing home was designed for living, sleeping, cooking and eating and the residents were there on a nontransient basis. <em>McNeill </em>v. <em>Board of Assessors, </em>supra, 396 Mass. 605-606. After assuming for the purposes of its decision that the nursing home residents were nontransient, the Massachusetts Supreme Judicial Court concluded that it was reasonable to classify nursing homes as commercial property <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"208\">*208</page-number>because \u201c[t]he conunon thread of the commercial group quarters is their service-related functions and the relationship between those functions and the economic life of the enterprise. The entire economic basis for a nursing home is to provide services rather than simply to provide residential quarters. The board found that people enter nursing homes because they need care and treatment services and that the room and board provided is only a \u2018necessary incident\u2019 to those services. It is clear that in the absence of these services none of the residents could use the nursing home as a dwelling place.\u201d Id., 607-608. The court further reasoned that \u201cthe nursing home does not approximate normal family or residential living. The daily living routine of nursing home patients is highly supervised and closely regulated. The degree of supervision and regulation is incompatible with the activities normally associated with ordinary living or habitation.\u201d Id., 608.</p>\n<p id=\"b228-5\">On the basis of the legislative intent of \u00a7 12-62n, which was to keep taxes on residential property low in order to promote home ownership and owner occupied dwellings, and the use of the term \u201capartment property\u201d in the statute, as opposed to making specific reference to nursing homes in \u00a7 12-62n, and in reliance on the reasoning of our Appellate Court and the Massachusetts Supreme Judicial Court as cited herein, we conclude that the trial court properly determined that the plaintiffs\u2019 nursing homes do not contain dwelling units and therefore do not constitute \u201capartment property\u201d within the meaning of \u00a7 12-62n.</p>\n<p id=\"b228-6\">The judgment is affirmed.</p>\n<p id=\"b228-7\">In this opinion the other justices concurred.</p>\n<footnote label=\"1\">\n<p id=\"b213-5\"> General Statutes \u00a7 12-62n provides in relevant part: \u201c(a) For the purposes of this section:</p>\n<blockquote id=\"b213-6\">\u201c(1) \u2018Apartment property\u2019 means a building containing five or more dwelling units used for human habitation, the parcel of land on which such building is situated, and any accessory buildings or other improvements located on such parcel;</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b213-7\">\u201c(2) \u2018Base year\u2019 means the fiscal year immediately preceding the fiscal year in which a municipality levies property taxes on the basis of assessments derived from a revaluation implemented pursuant to section 12-62; and</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b213-8\">\u201c(3) \u2018Residential property\u2019 means a building containing four or fewer dwelling units used for human habitation, the parcel of land on which such building is situated, and any accessory buildings or other improvements located on such parcel.</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b213-9\">\u201c(b) Notwithstanding any provision of the general statutes or any special act, municipal charter or any home rule ordinance, any municipality in which the provisions of section 12-62d are effective for the assessment year commencing October 1, 2005, may, by ordinance, adopt the property tax system described in this section, provided the assessor of such municipality determines that without implementation of such property tax system, implementation of a revaluation for the assessment year commencing October 1, 2006, would result in an increase of twenty per cent in the share of the total grand levy for all property in the year following the base year, for the property classes composed of apartment property and residential property.</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b213-11\">\u201c(c) In any municipality that adopts the property tax system under this section, the assessor shall determine a rate of assessment for apartment property and residential property for the assessment year in which a revaluation is effective, that will have the effect of increasing the average property tax as a result of revaluation for the property classes composed of apartment property and residential property, by three and one-half per cent over the property tax for said property classes in the base year. Tax increases on apartment property and residential property provided for in this subsection shall be used to reduce, in the amount derived from such increases, the surcharge under section 12-62d. The assessor shall recalculate the rate of assessment for apartment property and residential property for each of the four assessment years following the assessment year in which the provisions of this section become effective such that the average property tax for the property classes composed of apartment property and residential property increases as a result of said revaluation by three and one-half per cent over the average property tax provided by this subsection for such property classes in each prior fiscal year. Notwithstanding the provisions of subsection (b) of section 12-62a, the assessor shall establish a rate of assessment for all real property other than apartment property and residential property, to effectuate the provisions of this section. . . .\u201d</blockquote>\n</footnote>\n<footnote label=\"2\">\n<p id=\"b214-5\"> The plaintiffs appealed from the judgment of the trial court to the Appellate Court, and we transferred the appeal to this court pursuant to General Statutes \u00a7 51-199 (c) and Practice Book \u00a7 65-1.</p>\n</footnote>\n<footnote label=\"3\">\n<p id=\"b214-6\"> General Statutes \u00a7 12-119 provides: \u201cWhen it is claimed that a tax has been laid on property not taxable in the town or city in whose tax list such property was set, or that a tax laid on property was computed on an assessment which, under all the circumstances, was manifestly excessive and could not have been arrived at except by disregarding the provisions of the statutes for determining the valuation of such property, the owner thereof or any lessee thereof whose lease has been recorded as provided in section 47-19 and who is bound under the terms of his lease to pay real property taxes, prior to the payment of such tax, may, in addition to the other remedies provided by law, make application for relief to the superior court for the judicial district in which such town or city is situated. Such application may be made within one year from the date as of which the property was last evaluated for purposes of taxation and shall be served and returned in the same manner as is required in the case of a summons in a civil action, and the pendency of such application shall not suspend action upon the tax against the applicant. In all such actions, the Superior Court shall have power to grant such relief upon such terms and in such maimer and form as to justice and equity appertains, and costs may be taxed at the discretion of the court. If such assessment is reduced by said court, the applicant shall be reimbursed by the town or city for any overpayment of taxes in accordance with the judgment of said court.\u201d</p>\n</footnote>\n<footnote label=\"4\">\n<p id=\"b214-7\"> The trial court also concluded that the plaintiffs\u2019 properties did not constitute \u201c \u2018[residential property\u2019 \u201d under \u00a7 12-62n (a) (3) because each of the subject nursing homes contain substantially more than four units. On appeal, the plaintiffs address this issue only in a footnote in their brief. In this footnote, the plaintiffs assert that this court could conclude that each of the nursing homes is a single dwelling unit, thereby making the parcels residential property under \u00a7 12-62n. See footnote 1 of this opinion. They further assert, however, that the trial court\u2019s conclusion that the properties do not constitute residential property is not ripe for review because the plaintiffs\u2019 properties have not yet been classified as either \u201cresidential property\u201d or \u201capartment property.\u201d Because the plaintiffs do not cite any authority or develop their claim with analysis, we conclude that the claim is inadequately briefed. See, e.g., <em>Connecticut Light &amp; Power Co. </em>v. <em>Dept. of Public Utility Control, </em>266 Conn. 108, 120, 830 A.2d 1121 (2003) (\u201c[ajnalysis, rather than mere abstract assertion, is required in order to avoid abandoning an issue by failure to brief the issue properly\u201d [internal quotation marks omitted]).

For purposes of convenience, we refer to the current revision of that statute.</p>\n</footnote>\n<footnote label=\"9\">\n<p id=\"b216-7\"> The trial court consolidated the two appeals because, although each appeal concerned a different property, the plaintiffs raised the same issue regarding classification.</p>\n</footnote>\n<footnote label=\"10\">\n<p id=\"b219-5\"> The plaintiffs additionally assert that the trial court improperly concluded that \u00a7 12-62n is a tax exemption statute and, therefore, improperly applied the rules of construction applicable to tax exemption statutes, under which exemptions are construed against the taxpayer. <em>Altray Co. </em>v. <em>Groppo, </em>244 Conn. 426, 432, 619 A.2d 443 (1993). Instead, the plaintiffs claim that the trial court should have applied the rules of construction for tax imposition statutes, whereby ambiguities are construed in favor of the taxpayer. <em>Prudential Property &amp; Casualty Ins. Co. </em>v. <em>Bannon, </em>233 Conn. 243, 248, 658 A.2d 567 (1995). On the basis of our previous discussion of our case law <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"200\">*200</page-number>that addresses similar issues, we conclude that \u00a7 12-62n is a real estate classification statute because the determinative issue arising in this appeal is whether the nursing homes properly were subject to taxation as commercial property rather than residential property, which is a classification issue. See, e.g., <em>Saybrook Point Marina Partnership </em>v. <em>Old Saybrook, </em>supra, 49 Conn. App. 112-13. Accordingly, we do not apply the rules of construction applicable to either a tax imposition or a tax exemption statute.</p>\n</footnote>\n<footnote label=\"11\">\n<p id=\"b222-7\"> We acknowledge that the term \u201cdwelling units\u201d is used in other statutes. See, e.g., General Statutes \u00a7 19a-420 (2) (\u201c \u2018[rjesident camp\u2019 means any youth camp which is established, conducted or maintained on any parcel or parcels of land on which there are located dwelling units or buddings intended to accommodate five or more children . . . for at least seventy-two consecutive hours and in which the campers attending such camps eat and sleep\u201d); General Statutes \u00a7 47a-54c (a) (\u201cEach building used as a tenement, lodging or boarding house shall be furnished with adequate and suitable privy vaults or water closets. There shall be at least one such water closet or vault for each two dwelling units or apartments of two rooms or less each, and one such water closet or vault for each dwelling unit or apartment of three or more rooms.\u201d). Those statutes, however, demonstrate the broad applicability of the term \u201cdwelling units,\u201d which further suggest the ambiguity of that term.</p>\n</footnote>\n<footnote label=\"12\">\n<p id=\"b222-8\"> We note that although the plaintiffs and the defendant do not explicitly argue in their briefs filed in this court that \u00a7 12-62n is ambiguous, both briefs cite \u00a7 l-2z and the plaintiffs\u2019 brief cites the legislative history of \u00a7 12-62n, which we may consider only if the statute is ambiguous. We therefore construe the briefs as implicitly acknowledging that \u00a7 12-62n is ambiguous.</p>\n</footnote>\n<footnote label=\"13\">\n<p id=\"b223-5\"> Unlike landlords who own the property and receive a direct benefit from a lower property tax, renters potentially receive an indirect benefit. A landlord with reduced property taxes could, hypothetically, pass along those savings to his tenants by reducing the rent.
