(defendant), appeals<footnotemark>2</footnotemark> from the judgment of the trial court awarding the defendant and counterclaim plaintiff, Joseph J. Wall (plaintiff), damages in the amount of $282,827 on his counterclaim alleging that the defendant\u2019s failure to pay the plaintiff certain bonuses constituted a breach of his employment contract and the Connecticut wage statutes (wage statutes), General Statutes \u00a7 31-71a et seq.<footnotemark>3</footnotemark> On appeal, the defendant claims that the trial court <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"149\">*149</page-number>improperly: (1) concluded that the bonuses claimed by the plaintiff are subject to the wage statutes; (2) calculated the bonuses owed; (3) rejected its special defenses of accord and satisfaction and substitution of contract; and (4) denied its motion to dismiss the counterclaim for lack of standing and judicial estoppel on the basis of the plaintiffs failure to list the wage claims as assets in two bankruptcy petitions. We disagree and, accordingly, we affirm the judgment of the trial court.</p>\n<p id=\"b169-5\">The record reveals the following facts, which are either undisputed or were found by the trial court, and procedural history. The defendant is a Connecticut corporation that provides administrative, marketing and technical services to numerous nonprofit professional and trade associations. The defendant\u2019s president and founder is Peter Berry, whose wife, Suzanne Berry, serves as executive vice president. In August, 2002, the defendant hired the plaintiff as a consultant to upgrade its computer system. Due to the growth of the defendant, and the Berrys\u2019 desire to spend more of then-working time on client development, the defendant hired the plaintiff shortly thereafter to serve as its chief operating officer, with the title of senior vice president. The plaintiff worked initially in accordance with a letter of intent. This was followed by an employment contract that was executed in July, 2003 (employment agreement), and was set to expire on August 6, 2005. Schedule 3.2 of the employment agreement, which set forth the plaintiffs responsibilities, intended the plaintiff to spend 70 percent of his working time overseeing the defendant\u2019s information technology, financial and <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"150\">*150</page-number>human relations divisions, and specifically developing a Digital Group to provide enhanced Internet and mail services for its clients, with the remainder of his time devoted to other administrative and strategic responsibilities.</p>\n<p id=\"b170-6\">Under the employment agreement, the plaintiffs base salary was $86,000, with 5 percent annual increases to be given on August 7, 2003, and August 7, 2004.<footnotemark>4</footnotemark> Under \u00a7 2.4 of the employment agreement, the plaintiff also received a $100 monthly office allowance for items such as remote access and telephone charges.<footnotemark>5</footnotemark> Additional compensation for the plaintiff was furnished pursuant to \u00a7 2.2 of the employment agreement, which provides in relevant part: \u201c[The plaintiff] shall be entitled to receive commissions and bonuses calculated as follows:</p>\n<blockquote id=\"b170-7\">* * *</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b170-8\">\u201c(b) [The plaintiff] shall be paid bonuses on February 15,2004; August 15, 2004; February 15,2005 and; August 6,2005 based upon the overall profitability of the Digital Group from July 1, 2003 through June 20, 2005. Said bonus amounts shall be calculated based upon the 2003-04 Digital Group budget as set forth in Schedule 2.2 and the 2004-05 budget which will be established in the [s]pring of 2004. [The plaintiffs] bonus shall be equal to the annual income received by the Digital Group less $75,000 for fiscal year 2003-2004 and $80,000 <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"151\">*151</page-number>for fiscal year 2004-2005, and less the commissions paid pursuant to paragraph (a) above. [The plaintiffs] bonus will be determined after the Digital Group\u2019s expenses are paid for the preceding six month period and after [the defendant] receives its six months prorated income. [The plaintiff] shall then receive the remaining profit. . . .\u201d<footnotemark>6</footnotemark></blockquote>\n<p id=\"b171-5\">Following some initial disagreement concerning the bonus amount owed under the employment agreement, namely, the percentage of the Digital Group\u2019s net profit to which the plaintiff was entitled, on February 15, 2004, the defendant ultimately acceded to the plaintiffs request for a first bonus in the amount of $28,883.<footnotemark>7</footnotemark> The parties\u2019 relationship then grew increasingly strained and, by the spring of 2004, the Berrys had expressed concerns with the plaintiffs performance as an administrator, informed him that the bonus provisions in the employment agreement were \u201cnot working for them,\u201d and sought to change the focus of his employment to more technical work, with a fixed salary of $90,000 plus <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"152\">*152</page-number>discretionary bonuses. To that end, in July, 2004, the defendant proposed to amend the employment agreement by deleting the bonus provisions of \u00a7 2.2 in their entirety. The plaintiff refused, however, to sign that proposal.</p>\n<p id=\"b172-5\">The defendant subsequently did not pay the plaintiff his second bonus payment, for the second half of the 2003-2004 fiscal year, which was due on August 15, 2004 (second bonus). The parties did not discuss the bonus issue again until November 15, 2004, when the defendant proposed to pay the plaintiff a second bonus in the amount of $8727, despite the plaintiffs claim that he was owed $58,329. Peter Berry then told the plaintiff that he no longer was willing to discuss the issue and, the following morning, he presented the plaintiff with a letter on behalf of the defendant signed by himself and Suzanne Berry. In the letter, the defendant presented the plaintiff with two options: \u201c(1) Sign the requested contract amendment; accept [its] offer of an [$8000] bonus; and leave open the possibility of extending your contract that expires in August, 2005; or (2) [r]equire [it] to pay you the bonus that you are seeking thereby acknowledging that your contract will not be renewed next year.\u201d The plaintiff declined to accept either option, but directed the payroll office to pay him $8000 toward the amount that he believed that he was owed.<footnotemark>8</footnotemark> The plaintiff testified that he took the $8000 because he had been experiencing personal financial difficulties, of which the Berrys were aware.</p>\n<p id=\"b172-6\">Subsequently, on December 13, 2004, the defendant exercised its termination option under \u00a74.1 of the <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"153\">*153</page-number>employment agreement,<footnotemark>9</footnotemark> gave the plaintiff the required sixty days notice and renewed its offer of a different position at a salary of $90,000, excluding bonuses. The plaintiff accepted that offer and signed a new employment contract on January 3, 2005 (2005 contract), reasoning that he needed a job, but nevertheless claimed entitlement to the bonus, on the basis of the Digital Group\u2019s performance for the first half of the 2004-2005 fiscal year, that would be due on February 15, 2005, under the terms of the original employment agreement <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"154\">*154</page-number>(third bonus), prior to the 2005 contract taking effect. See also part IV B of this opinion. Through the remainder of 2005, the plaintiffs role with the defendant was reduced to the management of the Digital Group.</p>\n<p id=\"b174-5\">In June, 2005, the plaintiff filed a claim with the wage and workplace standards division of the department of labor (department), seeking to collect the unpaid second and third bonuses. The parties\u2019 relationship deteriorated even further over the summer and, by August, 2005, while the plaintiff was away on vacation, he learned that the defendant had locked him out of remote access to its computer servers. The plaintiff then sent a letter to Peter Berry indicating that he took the lockout as a sign he was no longer employed by the defendant, and he did not subsequently return to his job.</p>\n<p id=\"b174-6\">In August, 2005, the defendant initiated this action seeking damages and injunctive relief against the plaintiff, claiming, inter alia, that he had breached both non-compete provisions of the employment agreement and his fiduciary duty by: (1) not returning to work after his vacation; and (2) promoting his former business and seeking a new job. The plaintiff then filed an answer generally denying the claims in the complaint and raising numerous special defenses, along with the counterclaim at issue in the present appeal seeking money damages, twice the full amount of the unpaid wages, attorney\u2019s fees and costs, and a prejudgment remedy on the ground that the defendant\u2019s failure to pay the plaintiff his bonuses and the $100 monthly office allowance violated the employment agreement and the wage statutes, specifically General Statutes \u00a7\u00a7 31-71b,<footnotemark>10</footnotemark> 31-<page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"155\">*155</page-number>71c,<footnotemark>11</footnotemark> 31-71e<footnotemark>12</footnotemark> and 31-73.<footnotemark>13</footnotemark> Thereafter, the defendant withdrew the original complaint after the parties were <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"156\">*156</page-number>able to resolve the issues raised therein, leaving only the counterclaim pending. See also footnote 3 of this opinion.</p>\n<p id=\"b176-5\">Subsequently, the proceedings were stayed pursuant to 11 U.S.C. \u00a7 362 and Practice Book \u00a7 14-1 because of the plaintiffs filing of an application for relief in the United States Bankruptcy Court for the District of Connecticut (Bankruptcy Court) under chapter 13 of the United States Bankruptcy Code. The stay was terminated after the Bankruptcy Court dismissed the plaintiffs petition for relief.</p>\n<p id=\"b176-6\">After the plaintiff filed a revised counterclaim that named Peter Berry personally as a defendant,<footnotemark>14</footnotemark> the defendant moved to dismiss that revised counterclaim for lack of subject matter jurisdiction, contending that the plaintiff both lacked standing to assert the claims raised therein and was judicially estopped from raising those claims. The trial court, <em>Hon. Richard M. Ritten-band, </em>judge trial referee, denied the defendant\u2019s motion to dismiss the counterclaim, a proceeding that is discussed in greater detail in part I of this opinion.</p>\n<p id=\"b176-7\">With leave of the court, the plaintiff then filed an amended counterclaim, citing General Statutes \u00a7 31-72<footnotemark>15</footnotemark> <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"157\">*157</page-number>as authorizing an award of attorney\u2019s fees and twice the full amount of his unpaid wages. The defendant responded by filing an answer and asserting numerous special defenses, including that: (1) the plaintiff had failed to state a claim under the wage statutes because the bonuses were not \u201cwages\u201d as defined therein; (2) the court lacked subject matter jurisdiction; (3) the doctrine of judicial estoppel precluded the plaintiff from pursuing the counterclaim personally; (4) the doctrine of accord and satisfaction resolved the plaintiffs claim for the second bonus; (5) the plaintiff had waived his claim to the second bonus; and (6) the January, 2005 revised employment agreement operated as an accord and satisfaction that waived the plaintiffs right to any further bonus compensation, including the third bonus.<footnotemark>16</footnotemark></p>\n<p id=\"b178-5\"><page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"158\">*158</page-number>During the subsequent trial to the court, Judge Ritten-band heard testimony from the plaintiff, Peter Berry and Suzanne Berry. The trial court first credited the testimony of the plaintiff over that of the Berrys, finding that the plaintiff was \u201chonest, candid and forthright,\u201d and that the Berrys, \u201cwhen they realized that the [employment agreement] required them to pay [the plaintiff] more in bonuses than they anticipated, when they realized that the [employment agreement] they had prepared was less favorable to them than they thought, tried every which way to avoid paying their obligations. That\u2019s why they insisted on [the plaintiff] signing [the 2005 contract] which did not include provisions for bonuses. Further, aware that [the plaintiff] had financial problems, they pressured him to take less than the bonuses he was due with the implied threat that if he continued to contest the amount of the bonuses, his employment would be terminated. Peter Berry made it very clear that there was to be no further discussion of bonuses.\u201d</p>\n<p id=\"b178-6\">The trial court then concluded that, under \u00a7 2.2 (b) of the employment agreement, the plaintiff was entitled to receive a second bonus of $50,329, and a third bonus of $67,397. See also part III of this opinion. The trial court also determined that the plaintiff was entitled to $1700 in unpaid office allowances. The trial court then rejected each of the special defenses, noting that it already had addressed the standing and judicial estop-pel claims in ruling on the defendant\u2019s motion to dismiss, and that the plaintiff had conceded that he did not have a viable claim against Peter Berry individually. See footnote 3 of this opinion. The trial court also disagreed with the defendant\u2019s contention that the plaintiffs claims were barred by the doctrine of accord and satisfaction, crediting the plaintiffs testimony that he \u201ctook the [partial payment of] $8000 because he was in financial trouble and in no way agreed to that being <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"159\">*159</page-number>the full satisfaction of his claim for bonus compensation.\u201d The trial court then found that the 2005 contract, executed in January, 2005, did not mention bonus compensation and, therefore, did not waive the plaintiffs claims for any bonuses earned prior to that contract.</p>\n<p id=\"b179-5\">The trial court then determined that the plaintiff was entitled to relief under the double damages and attorney\u2019s fees provisions of \u00a7 31-72.<footnotemark>17</footnotemark> The trial court concluded that the bonuses in this case were wages as defined by \u00a7 31-71a (3) because \u00a7 2.2 (b) of the employment agreement set forth a formula by which the bonus would be calculated, which was an \u201cother basis of calculation\u201d under \u00a7 31-71a (3) because \u201cit is tied into achievement of better work performance on the part of [the plaintiff] to obtain a higher profit which results in a higher bonus.\u201d Thus, the trial court found that the defendant had violated \u00a7 31-71e by improperly withholding the plaintiffs wages, and \u00a7 31-73 by pressuring the plaintiff to \u201csign a new contract and . . . modify the original contract with at least the implied threat of termination of employment.\u201d Thus, the trial corat rendered judgment for the plaintiff in the amount of $282,827, consisting of $237,152 in damages, or double the unpaid bonuses plus the $1700 unpaid office allowance and statutory interest in the amount of $45,675.<footnotemark>18</footnotemark> This appeal followed.<footnotemark>19</footnotemark></p>\n<p id=\"b180-4\"><page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"160\">*160</page-number>On appeal, the defendant claims that the trial court improperly: (1) concluded that the bonuses claimed by the plaintiff are wages under \u00a7 31-71a (3); (2) construed the employment agreement in calculating the bonuses owed to the plaintiff; (3) rejected its accord and satisfaction and waiver defenses; and (4) denied the defendant\u2019s motion to dismiss the counterclaim on grounds of standing and judicial estoppel. Additional facts and procedural history will be set forth as necessary.</p>\n<p id=\"b180-5\">I</p>\n<p id=\"b180-6\">Because the defendant\u2019s standing arguments implicate our subject matter jurisdiction, we begin with its claims that the trial court improperly denied its motion to dismiss the counterclaim. Specifically, the defendant claims that: (1) the plaintiff lacked standing to bring this counterclaim because, when he filed for bankruptcy protection twice in 2005, he surrendered those claims to the trustee of the bankruptcy estate (trustee), and his failure to schedule the claims as assets meant that they remained part of the bankruptcy estate even after those proceedings had terminated; and (2) under the doctrine of judicial estoppel, the plaintiffs failures to disclose the claims during the bankruptcy proceedings bar him from reasserting them in this state court proceeding.</p>\n<p id=\"b180-7\">The record reveals the following additional relevant undisputed facts and procedural history. In January, 2005, the plaintiff filed for federal bankruptcy protection under chapter 13 of the United States Bankruptcy Code. The plaintiff did not list the unpaid second bonus as an asset on the bankruptcy schedules because his bankruptcy attorney had not advised him to do so. In July, 2005, after the plaintiff had initiated proceedings with the department to collect the unpaid second and third bonuses, the Bankruptcy Court dismissed his <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"161\">*161</page-number>bankruptcy petition before the plaintiff had received a discharge of his debts because he had failed to submit to the trustee certain state income tax returns.</p>\n<p id=\"b181-5\">In October, 2005, while the defendant\u2019s original action against the plaintiff to enforce the noncompete provisions of the employment agreement was pending, the plaintiff filed a second chapter 13 bankruptcy petition in order to protect his home from foreclosure. The plaintiff then filed the counterclaim in Superior Court that gives rise to the present appeal, seeking payment of the unpaid bonuses in November, 2005. The plaintiff again did not amend the asset schedule in the second bankruptcy to include these claims. The pending bankruptcy petition then stayed this action. See 11 U.S.C. \u00a7 362; Practice Book \u00a7 14-1.</p>\n<p id=\"b181-6\">On January 23,2007, after the plaintiff had refinanced his mortgage on his house outside of the bankruptcy proceedings, the Bankruptcy Court dismissed the second petition without discharging the debts, which terminated the stay of this action.<footnotemark>20</footnotemark> Thereafter, the plaintiff filed the revised counterclaim on January 29,2008, more than one year after the dismissal of his second bankruptcy petition.</p>\n<p id=\"b181-7\">On June 11, 2008, the defendant moved to dismiss the revised counterclaim, claiming that the court lacked subject matter jurisdiction. The defendant claimed specifically that the plaintiffs failure to schedule these claims in his bankruptcy petitions meant that they had not revested in him personally, and therefore, he lacked standing to bring suit on it. The defendant also contended that the plaintiffs failure to schedule these claims had judicially estopped him from bringing them against the defendant in the present state court action. <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"162\">*162</page-number>On July 3, 2008, the plaintiff filed the amended counterclaim. See footnote 14 of this opinion.</p>\n<p id=\"b182-6\">Thereafter, Judge Rittenband held a hearing on the defendant\u2019s motion to dismiss and rendered judgment in the form of an oral decision denying that motion.<footnotemark>21</footnotemark> The court concluded that 11 U.S.C. \u00a7 349 (b) (3),<footnotemark>22</footnotemark> \u201cupon the dismissal of a [bankruptcy] case . . . revest[s] the property of the estate in the entity in which such property was vested immediately before the commencement of the case . . . .\u201d Thus, after the second petition was dismissed, the claims had revested in the plaintiff, who, therefore, had standing to assert them against the defendant. Moreover, the trial court concluded that the plaintiffs failure to disclose the claims in his bankruptcy petitions did not preclude the claims from revesting because neither the Bankruptcy Court nor his creditors had relied detrimentally on such nondisclosure.</p>\n<p id=\"b182-7\">A</p>\n<p id=\"b182-8\">The defendant first contends that, although the plaintiff had the right to pursue these claims when they first arose in 2004, he had surrendered ownership of these claims, as assets, to the trustee once he filed for bankruptcy protection in 2005. Relying on, inter alia, <em>Kunica </em>v. <em>St. Jean Financial, Inc., </em>233 B.R. 46 (Bankr. S.D.N.Y. 1999), the defendant contends further that, because the plaintiff had failed to disclose the claims to the Bankruptcy Court, the trustee was precluded from <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"163\">*163</page-number>abandoning them to the plaintiff pursuant to 11 U.S.C. \u00a7 554,<footnotemark>23</footnotemark> and they remained part of the bankruptcy estate even after the dismissal of the case, rather than revest-ing in the plaintiff, effectively meaning that he never regained standing to assert the claims in a personal or nonrepresentative capacity. In response, the plaintiff relies on, inter alia, <em>B.N. Realty Associates </em>v. <em>Lichtenstein, </em>21 App. Div. 3d 793, 801 N.Y.S.2d 271 (2005), and contends that 11 U.S.C. \u00a7 554 does not apply because he never received a <em>discharge </em>in bankruptcy, or its \u201c \u2018functional equivalent\u2019 \u201d but, rather, his bankruptcies were <em>dismissed </em>pursuant to 11 U.S.C. \u00a7 1307 (c)<footnotemark>24</footnotemark> without any administration. Instead, the plaintiff <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"164\">*164</page-number>claims, the effect of a dismissal pursuant to 11 U.S.C. \u00a7 1307 (c) is governed by 11 U.S.C. \u00a7 349 (b) (3), which is intended to restore the parties to their status at the commencement of the proceedings. Thus, the plaintiff contends that the claims properly revested in him upon the dismissal of the bankruptcy petition, and he, therefore, has standing to maintain this action. We agree with the plaintiff.</p>\n<p id=\"b184-5\">\u201cThe issue of standing implicates subject matter jurisdiction and is therefore a basis for granting a motion to dismiss. . . . [I]t is the burden of the party who seeks the exercise of jurisdiction in his favor . . . clearly to allege facts demonstrating that he is a proper party to invoke judicial resolution of the dispute. . . . It is well established that, in determining whether a court has subject matter jurisdiction, every presumption favoring jurisdiction should be indulged. . . . Because a determination regarding the trial court\u2019s subject matter jurisdiction raises a question of law, our review is plenary.\u201d (Citations omitted; internal quotation marks omitted.) <em>Wilcox </em>v. <em>Webster Ins., Inc., </em>294 Conn. 206, 213-14, 982 A.2d 1053 (2009).</p>\n<p id=\"b184-6\">Commencement of a bankruptcy proceeding creates an estate that comprises \u201call legal or equitable interests of the debtor in property as of the commencement of <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"165\">*165</page-number>the case.\u201d 11 U.S.C. \u00a7 541 (a) (1). The debtor must file a formal statement with the Bankruptcy Court including a schedule of his or her assets and liabilities. See 11 U.S.C. \u00a7 521 (a) (1) (B) (i). The assets, which become the property of the bankruptcy estate, include all causes of action belonging to the debtor that accrued prior to the filing of the bankruptcy petition. See, e.g., <em>In re Jackson, </em>593 F.3d 171, 176 (2d Cir. 2010). A cause of action becomes a part of the bankruptcy estate even if the debtor fails to schedule the claim in his petition. See, e.g., <em>Rosenshein </em>v. <em>Kleban, </em>918 F. Sup. 98, 103 (S.D.N.Y. 1996). \u201cProperty that is scheduled pursuant to 11 U.S.C. \u00a7 521 (1), but not administered by the plan, is abandoned to the debtor by operation of law at the close of the bankruptcy case. See 11 U.S.C. \u00a7 554 (c). By contrast, property that is not formally scheduled is not abandoned and therefore remains part of the estate. See 11 U.S.C. \u00a7 554 (d) . . . .\u201d <em>Rosenshein </em>v. <em>Kleban, </em>supra, 102-103. \u201cCourts have held that because an unscheduled claim remains the property of the bankruptcy estate, the debtor lacks standing to pursue the claims after emerging from bankruptcy, and the claims must be dismissed.\u201d Id., 103.</p>\n<p id=\"b185-5\">We agree with the plaintiff that 11 U.S.C. \u00a7 554 does not deprive him of standing with respect to his counterclaim, and that, because of the dismissal pursuant to 11 U.S.C. \u00a7 1307 (c); see footnote 24 of this opinion; 11 U.S.C. \u00a7 349 (b) (3) is dispositive of the defendant\u2019s subject matter jurisdiction claim in this appeal. Section 349 (b) (3) of title 11 of the United States Code provides in relevant part: \u201cUnless the court, for cause, orders otherwise, a dismissal of a case other than under section 742 of this title ... (3) <em>revests the property of the estate in the entity in which such property was vested immediately before the commencement of the case under this title.\" </em>(Emphasis added.) \u201cThe basic purpose of . . . [11 U.S.C. \u00a7 349 (b)] is to undo the bankruptcy <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"166\">*166</page-number>case, as far as practicable, and to restore all property rights to the position in which they were found at the commencement of the case.\u201d (Internal quotation marks omitted.) <em>In re Randall, </em>358 B.R. 145, 168 (Bankr.

Indeed, unless the court indicates otherwise, the general effect of an order of dismissal is to restore the status quo ante; it is as if the bankruptcy petition had never been filed.\u201d (Internal quotation marks omitted.) <em>In re Randall, </em>supra, 168.</p>\n<p id=\"b186-5\">With no Connecticut case law directly on point,<footnotemark>25</footnotemark> we agree with the plaintiffs reliance on, inter alia, <em>B.N. Realty Associates </em>v. <em>Lichtenstein, </em>supra, 21 App. Div. 3d 793, in support of the proposition that, under 11 U.S.C. \u00a7 349 (b) (3), the failure to disclose a cause of action in bankruptcy proceedings does not preclude the assertion of that claim in proceedings instituted after the dismissal of the bankruptcy proceedings. In <em>B.N. Realty Associates </em>v. <em>Lichtenstein, </em>supra, 798, the First Department of the Appellate Division of the New <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"167\">*167</page-number>York Supreme Court concluded that, when the Bankruptcy Court dismisses the debtor\u2019s petition, 11 U.S.C. \u00a7 349 (b) (3) operates to \u201crestor[e] his standing to assert his alleged counterclaims, defenses and offsets in this action, notwithstanding his failure (which we obviously do not condone) to disclose such matters in the bankruptcy case . . . .\u201d<footnotemark>26</footnotemark> (Citation omitted.) Significantly, the New York court distinguished <em>Kunica </em>v. <em>St. Jean Financial, Inc., </em>supra, 233 B.R. 46, a case that the <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"168\">*168</page-number>defendant in the present case relies upon in support of its contention that the undisclosed claims did not revest in the plaintiff. The New York court relied on the federal District Court\u2019s observation that the debtor in <em>Kunica </em>had \u201carguably obtained the functional equivalent of a discharge\u201d because it had \u201cobtained its dismissal after its [bankruptcy] case was fully administered and all of its assets scheduled . . . .\u201d (Citation omitted; internal quotation marks omitted.) <em>B.N. Realty Associates </em>v. Lichtenstein, supra, 798, quoting <em>Kunica </em>v. <em>St. Jean Financial, Inc., </em>supra, 55. In contrast, the debtor <em>in B.N. Realty Associates </em>had not \u201c \u2018obtained the functional equivalent of a discharge,\u2019 \u201d as his assets had not been administered or his debt restructured prior to the dismissal. <em>B.N. Realty Associates </em>v. <em>Lichtenstein, </em>supra, 798. Thus, we conclude that the plaintiff in the present case, like the debtor in <em>B.N. Realty Associates, </em>has standing to assert this counterclaim because the Bankruptcy Court had dismissed his petitions prior to their administration.

App. 1999) (rejecting claim that plaintiffs\u2019 failure to schedule cause of action as asset in chapter 13 bankruptcy proceeding caused it to remain part of bankruptcy estate pursuant to 11 U.S.C. \u00a7 554 after voluntary dismissal of proceeding, and concluding that they could pursue it under 11 U.S.C. \u00a7 349 [b] [3]), writ denied, 759 So. 2d 76 (La. 2000).

It claims that the trial court should have barred the plaintiff from pursuing his monetary claims because <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"169\">*169</page-number>his failure to disclose such claims during the bankruptcy proceedings amounted to an affirmative misrepresentation to that court. In response, the plaintiff contends that the doctrine of judicial estoppel does not bar him from pursuing his claims since his petitions were dismissed and, therefore, neither the Bankruptcy Court nor his creditors relied on his nondisclosure to their detriment. The plaintiff also emphasizes that his failure to disclose the monetary claims against the defendant to the Bankruptcy Court was an unintentional error. We conclude that the trial court did not abuse its discretion by declining to invoke the doctrine of judicial estop-pel to bar the plaintiffs counterclaim.</p>\n<p id=\"b189-5\">Because this case presents the first opportunity for this court or the Appellate Court to consider the doctrine of judicial estoppel as a matter of Connecticut law,<footnotemark>27</footnotemark> we turn for guidance to the significant body of federal case law addressing this doctrine, and note that \u201c[j]udicial estoppel prevents a party in a legal proceeding from taking a position contrary to a position the party has taken in an earlier proceeding. . . . [Jjudicial estoppel serves interests different from those served by equitable estoppel, which is designed to ensure fairness in the relationship between parties. . . . The courts invoke judicial estoppel as a means to preserve the sanctity of the oath or to protect judicial integrity by avoiding the risk of inconsistent results in two proceedings.\u201d (Citations omitted; internal quotation marks omitted.) <em>Simon </em>v. <em>Safelite Glass Corp., </em>128 F.3d 68, <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"170\">*170</page-number>71 (2d Cir. 1997); see also, e.g., <em>New Hampshire </em>v.

See, e.g., <em>Galin </em>v. <em>Internal Revenue Service, </em>563 F. Sup. 2d 332, 338-39 (D. Conn. 2008). This is because \u201cthe integrity of the bankruptcy system depends on full and honest disclosure by debtors of all of their assets. The courts will not permit a debtor to obtain relief from the [Bankruptcy [C]ourt by representing that no claims exist and then subsequently to assert those claims for his own benefit in a separate proceeding. The interests of both the creditors, who plan their actions in the bankruptcy proceeding on the basis of information supplied in the <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"171\">*171</page-number>disclosure statements, and the [B]ankruptcy [C]ourt, which must decide whether to approve the plan of reorganization on the same basis, are impaired when the disclosure provided by the debtor is incomplete.\u201d <em>Rosenshein </em>v. <em>Kleban, </em>supra, 918 F.

See, e.g., <em>Robinson </em>v. <em>Tyson Foods, Inc., </em>595 F.3d 1269, 1273 (11th Cir. 2010); <em>Williams </em>v. <em>Boeing Co., </em>517 F.3d 1120, 1134 (9th Cir. 2008).</p>\n<p id=\"b191-6\">The plaintiff fully acknowledges his failure to disclose his monetary claims against the defendant to the Bankruptcy Court in both bankruptcy cases. We agree with the plaintiff that the trial court did not abuse its discretion in declining to utilize the doctrine of judicial estop-pel to preclude the counterclaim, as courts generally will not apply the doctrine if the first statement or omission \u201cwas the result of a good faith mistake . . . or an unintentional error.\u201d<footnotemark>28</footnotemark> (Citations omitted.) <em>Simon </em><page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"172\">*172</page-number>v. <em>Safelite Glass Corp., </em>supra, 128 F.3d 73; <em>In re Andrews, </em>385 B.R. 496, 502 (Bankr. D. Conn. 2008). The defendant failed to develop the record on this issue further at the hearing before the trial court on its motion to dismiss, and has not pointed to any evidence contradicting the plaintiffs assertion that he did not realize that he was supposed to list this counterclaim as an asset in the bankruptcy proceeding, and was not advised to that effect by his bankruptcy attorney. Moreover, given the dismissals of the plaintiffs bankruptcy petitions, there is neither a risk of inconsistent results between the state and federal courts, nor any indication that either the Bankruptcy Court or the plaintiffs creditors, who did not include among them the defendant, were prejudiced by that nondisclosure. Accordingly, we conclude that the trial court did not abuse its discretion by declining to invoke the doctrine of judicial estoppel.</p>\n<p id=\"b192-5\">II</p>\n<p id=\"b192-6\">We next turn to the principal issue in this appeal, namely, the defendant\u2019s claim that the bonuses claimed by the plaintiff under \u00a7 2.2 (b) of the employment agreement are not wages as defined by \u00a7 31-71a (3). Relying primarily on <em>Weems </em>v. <em>Citigroup, Inc., </em>289 Conn. 769, 961 A.2d 349 (2008), the defendant contends that the bonuses are not wages because they were based entirely on the profitability of the Digital Group, and were not connected directly with the plaintiffs personal <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"173\">*173</page-number>labor or services. The defendant characterizes the bonuses as a profit sharing mechanism, and emphasizes that the Digital Group\u2019s \u201cprofit would result from the efforts of other employees, from the payments made [by the defendant\u2019s clients] for receiving [the] Digital [Group] services, and by minimizing or eliminating expenses within [the] Digital [Group]. Whether [the plaintiff] ever showed up for work did not dictate the bonus amount or his right to receive a payment . . . [which] relied on a formula and a calculation which had no connection with [the plaintiffs] performance.\u201d In response, the plaintiff emphasizes the remedial purpose of the wage statutes; <em>Mytych </em>v. <em>May Dept. Stores Co., </em>260 Conn. 152, 160, 793 A.2d 1068 (2002); and contends that the wage statutes must be liberally construed in favor of employees. The plaintiff also relies on New York case law, which we followed in <em>Weems, </em>and contends that a contractually mandated, nondiscretionary bonus calculated under a predetermined formula is subject to the wage statutes, and emphasizes that <em>Weems </em>should be limited to the context of discretionary bonuses. Guided in part by our recent decision in <em>Ziotas </em>v. <em>Reardon Law Firm, P.C., </em>296 Conn. 579, 997 A.2d 453 (2010), we conclude that the trial court properly determined that the bonuses in the present case were wages because they were nondiscretionary and calculated in accordance with a precise formula set forth in \u00a7 2.2 (b) of the employment agreement.</p>\n<p id=\"b193-5\">\u201cWhether a bonus constitutes a wage under \u00a7 31-71a (3) raises a question of statutory construction, which is a [question] of law, over which we exercise plenary review.\u201d (Internal quotation marks omitted.) <em>Weems </em>v. <em>Citigroup, Inc., </em>supra, 289 Conn. 778. We note, however, that \u201c[i]n determining whether the plaintiffs . . . bonus [es are] included in [the] definition of wages, we do not write on a blank slate.\u201d <em>Ziotas </em>v. <em>Reardon Law Firm, P.C., </em>supra, 296 Conn. 587.</p>\n<p id=\"b194-4\"><page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"174\">*174</page-number>We begin then, with <em>Weems, </em>wherein we determined initially that the text of \u00a7 31-71a (3), which defines wages as \u201ccompensation for labor or services rendered by an employee, whether the amount is determined on a time, task, piece, commission or other basis of calculation,\u201d was ambiguous as to whether a bonus, even one \u201cdiscretionary or not specifically tied to identifiable extra work performed by an employee, could be considered \u2018compensation for labor or services rendered . . . (Citation omitted.) <em>Weems </em>v. <em>Citigroup, Inc., </em>supra, 289 Conn. 779. Considering extratextual sources to determine the ambiguous statute\u2019s meaning; see General Statutes \u00a7 l-2z; we noted the absence of guidance in the legislative history and turned instead to New York case law that construed that state\u2019s similar wage statute. See <em>Weems </em>v. <em>Citigroup, Inc., </em>supra, 780-82, discussing, inter alia, <em>Truelove </em>v. <em>Northeast Capital &amp; Advisory, Inc., </em>95 N.Y.2d 220, 738 N.E.2d 770, 715 N.Y.S.2d 366 (2000). In accordance with that body of case law, we concluded that \u201cbonuses that are awarded solely on a discretionary basis, and are not linked solely to the ascertainable efforts of the particular employee, are not wages under \u00a7 31-71a (3).\u201d<footnotemark>29</footnotemark> <em>Weems </em>v. <em>Citigroup, Inc., </em>supra, 782. Applying that standard to the facts of <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"175\">*175</page-number><em>Weems, </em>we concluded that the terms of the bonuses at issue therein were \u201cnot wages subject to Connecticut\u2019s wage statutes . . . [because] [p]ayments under both the bonus and branch manager programs are purely discretionary.\u201d Id. We further rejected the claim that \u201cbranch managers had to achieve \u2018specific goals\u2019 to receive the bonuses, thus rendering them compensation for services rendered\u201d; id.; because the record indicated that \u201cthe bonus awards are tied to subjective factors such as diversity within a branch, and the profitability of the particular branches, which are factors not entirely predictable or within the control of the specific employee.\u201d Id.</p>\n<p id=\"b195-5\">Subsequently, in <em>Ziotas </em>v. <em>Reardon Law Firm, P.C., </em>supra, 296 Conn. 583-84, the plaintiff claimed that his former employer, a law firm at which he had been an associate attorney, had violated the wage statutes by failing to pay him his annual bonus, customarily paid in December, after he left the employ of the law firm in October, 1998. That bonus was entirely discretionary and \u201cnot calculated on the basis of any particular percentage of the [law firm\u2019s] income.\u201d<footnotemark>30</footnotemark> Id., 583. We noted that <em>Weems </em>and the cases cited therein did not \u201caddress the situation in which the payment of a bonus was contractually required and only the amount of the bonus was discretionary\u201d; id., 588-89; but followed <em>Weems </em>to <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"176\">*176</page-number>conclude that \u201csuch a bonus does not constitute wages under \u00a7 31-71a (3) . . . [because] \u2018the wording of the statute, in expressly linking earnings to an employee\u2019s labor or services personally rendered, contemplates a more direct relationship between an employee\u2019s own performance and the compensation to which that employee is entitled. Discretionary additional remuneration, as a share in a reward to all employees for the success of the employer\u2019s entrepreneurship, falls outside the protection of the statute.\u2019 . . . Although an employee may have a justified expectation of additional compensation when the employer is contractually obligated to give a bonus to the employee and any contractual conditions, such as the employer\u2019s annual profitability, are met, the relationship between performance and compensation is still attenuated if the amount of the bonus is discretionary and dependent on factors other than the employee\u2019s performance.\u201d<footnotemark>31</footnotemark> (Citation omitted.) Id., 589.</p>\n<p id=\"b196-5\">Guided by <em>Ziotas </em>and <em>Weems, </em>we conclude that the trial court properly determined that the bonuses in the present case were wages as defined by \u00a7 31-71e (3) because, under the employment agreement, they were entirely nondiscretionary, both as to whether they would be awarded, and the amount thereof. Under the employment agreement, the defendant was contractually bound to pay the bonus to the plaintiff. Additionally, the amount of the bonus, which derived from the net profitability of the Digital Group after expenses, was nondiscretionary because it was subject to calculation by applying a contractually mandated, precise formula set forth in \u00a7 2.2 (b) of the employment agreement. That formula was based on the budgets of the Digital Group, <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"177\">*177</page-number>one of which, for fiscal year 2003-2004, was attached to the employment agreement as a schedule, and the other, for fiscal year 2004-2005, that was plainly cross-referenced therein. See footnote 6 of this opinion; see also <em>Farricker </em>v. <em>Penson Development, Inc., </em>United States District Court, Docket No. 07 Civ. 11191 (DAB), 2009 U.S. Dist. LEXIS 27484, *21-22 (S.D.N.Y. March 31, 2009) (bonus payments for identifying and consummating real estate deals were wages when contract \u201cclearly laid out the circumstances under which [they] were to be paid; both how much and when, and did not involve management discretion so as to render them incentive compensation,\u201d and payments were reduced by base salary); <em>Fiorenti </em>v. <em>Central Emergency Physicians, P.L.L.C., </em>187 Misc. 2d 805, 808-809, 723 N.Y.S.2d 851 (2001) (bonus was wage when contract set forth formula for calculating bonus that \u201ctakes into account the employee\u2019s personal productivity\u201d by measuring contribution to billing as offset by expenses because \u201c[t]he standard to be applied for entitlement to a bonus is objective and not subject to [the employer\u2019s] discretion or whim\u201d), rev\u2019d in part on other grounds, 305 App. Div. 2d 453, 762 N.Y.S.2d 402 (2003).</p>\n<p id=\"b197-5\">The defendant relies, however, on our statement in <em>Weems </em>v. <em>Citigroup, Inc., </em>supra, 289 Conn. 782, that bonuses are not wages under \u00a7 31-71a (3) if they are \u201cnot linked solely to the ascertainable efforts of the particular employee . . . .\u201d The defendant contends that the bonuses were based on the productivity of the Digital Group as a whole, and that there is no \u201cevidence directly linking those results solely\u201d to the efforts of the plaintiff. We disagree. First, we reiterate that, unlike the present case, in <em>Weems, </em>both the awarding of a bonus, and the amount thereof, were entirely discretionary. <em>Weems </em>v. <em>Citigroup, Inc., </em>supra, 782. Furthermore, this narrow reading of <em>Weems </em>does not recognize the nature of the plaintiffs employment as a senior level, <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"178\">*178</page-number>executive manager of one of the defendant\u2019s divisions, with the bonus tied <em>directly </em>to the success of that specific division, rather than the performance of the defendant as a whole. Although the profitability of any business entity depends in no small part on the performance of that organization\u2019s employees, schedule 3.2 of the employment agreement, as well as the parties\u2019 testimony, demonstrates that the plaintiff was employed primarily to manage the Digital Group\u2019s employees and operations. As reflected in the trial court\u2019s finding that the bonus \u201cis tied into achievement of better work performance on the part of [the plaintiff] to obtain a higher profit which results in a higher bonus,\u201d<footnotemark>32</footnotemark> the requisite \u201cascertainable efforts\u201d are reflected in the plaintiff\u2019s execution of his management responsibilities vis-\u00e1-vis the employees and other resources of the Digital Group in order to accomplish the profitability goals of that particular division.<footnotemark>33</footnotemark> Indeed, Peter Berry testified that the plaintiff could have accomplished that task in multiple ways, including <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"179\">*179</page-number>reducing costs, raising prices and generating more business. Put differently, to conclude that the bonus is not a wage because not every dollar earned by the Digital Group was directly attributable to the plaintiffs labors would be to ignore the realities of his executive-level managerial position, which was to be directly and solely responsible for the profitability of that division.<footnotemark>34</footnotemark></p>\n<p id=\"b199-5\">The plaintiffs contract thus established the necessary link between the plaintiffs efforts and the mandated bonus. See <em>Dallenbach </em>v. <em>Mapco Gas Products, Inc., </em>459 N.W.2d 483, 488 (Iowa 1990) (district manager\u2019s annual bonus was wage when contractually based on percentage of district\u2019s profits with adjustment by formula, and \u201cclearly was part of the compensation owed him for his labor or services\u201d); <em>Kvidera </em>v. <em>Rotation Engineering &amp; Mfg. Co., </em>705 N.W.2d 416, 423 (Minn. App. 2005) (company president\u2019s bonus was statutory wage because it was \u201cintegral and negotiated part of his compensation package\u201d and his \u201cservices contributed to [the company\u2019s] profitability, and [the company] received the benefit of [the president\u2019s] work product\u201d); <em>Suess </em>v. <em>Lee Sapp Leasing, Inc., </em>229 Neb. 755, 757, 762-63, 428 N.W.2d 899 (1988) (leasing manager\u2019s bonus was statutory wage when his contract granted him, inter alia, base salary plus 10 percent of employer\u2019s profits according to bonus formula); <em>Ives </em>v. <em>Manchester Subaru, Inc., </em>126 N.H. 796, 800, 498 A.2d 297 (1985) (automobile dealership manager\u2019s entitlement to percentage of dealer profits was wage because \u201c[i]t is obvi<page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"180\">*180</page-number>ous that the parties\u2019 agreement for a share of profits was intended to provide compensation for the [manager\u2019s] labor and services, and it clearly may fall within the [wage] statute\u2019s reference to compensation calculated on some \u2018other basis\u2019 \u201d); but cf. <em>Highhouse </em>v. <em>Midwest Orthopedic Institute, P.C., </em>807 N.E.2d 737, 740 (Ind. 2004) (A surgeon\u2019s bonus, provided for by contract, was not a statutory wage because it \u201cturned on both [the surgeon\u2019s] productivity and also on \u2018expenses of [the multiphysician practice\u2019s] operations,\u2019 presumably allocated based on revenue. [The surgeon] had no control over most of these expense items and they obviously affected [the practice\u2019s] bottom line.\u201d). Thus, we conclude that the bonus in the present case, which was nondiscretionary and narrowly tailored to the success of the corporate division over which the plaintiff had direct supervisory authority, was a wage as defined by \u00a7 31-73a (3).</p>\n<p id=\"b200-5\">Ill</p>\n<p id=\"b200-6\">The defendant next claims that the trial court improperly construed the employment agreement in calculating the bonus amounts for the second and third bonuses. Pointing to plaintiffs exhibit four, which is the Digital Group\u2019s <em>audited </em>financial statement for the fiscal year of July 1,2004, to June 30,2004, the defendant contends that, with respect to the second bonus period, which covers the period from January 1, 2004, to June 30, 2004, the trial court improperly relied on plaintiffs exhibit nine, the <em>budget schedule </em>2.2 attached to the employment agreement, and awarded the plaintiff $50,329, because the plaintiff had claimed entitlement only to a bonus of $31,063. In response, the plaintiff contends that the trial court properly awarded him $50,329 for the second bonus and $67,397 for the third bonus pursuant to the clear and unambiguous terms of the employment agreement, under which the defendant was to pay him 100 percent of the Digital Group\u2019s net <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"181\">*181</page-number>profit after the payment of expenses budgeted on a semiannual basis, as set forth in a schedule calculated by the defendant itself. The plaintiff contends that the defendant\u2019s argument that the contract terms contemplate calculations based on the final audited expenses is incorrect and simply an expression of buyer\u2019s remorse, and is inconsistent with the contract language drafted by the defendant itself, a sophisticated commercial party with superior bargaining power.<footnotemark>35</footnotemark> We agree with the plaintiff and conclude that the trial court properly calculated his bonuses.</p>\n<p id=\"b201-5\">We note briefly the following additional relevant facts and procedural history. The applicable contractual provision is \u00a7 2.2 (b) of the employment agreement, which provides: \u201c[The plaintiff] shall be paid bonuses on February 15, 2004; August 15, 2004; February 15, 2005 and; August 6, 2005 based upon the overall profitability of the Digital Group from July 1, 2003 through June 20, 2005. Said bonus amounts shall be calculated based upon the 2003-04 Digital Group <em>budget </em>as set forth in Schedule 2.2 and the 2004-05 <em>budget </em>which will be established in the [s]pring of 2004. [The plaintiffs] bonus shall be equal to the annual income received by the Digital Group less $75,000 for fiscal year 2003-2004 and $80,000 for fiscal year 2004-2005, and less the commissions paid pursuant to [p]aragraph (a) above. [The plaintiffs] bonus will be determined after the Digital Group\u2019s expenses are paid for the preceding six month period and after [the defendant] receives its six months <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"182\">*182</page-number>prorated income. [The plaintiff] shall then receive the remaining profit.\u201d (Emphasis added.)</p>\n<p id=\"b202-5\">The trial court concluded that the plaintiff was entitled to a second bonus of $50,329, which was due on August 15, 2004. In calculating that bonus, the trial court relied on the plain language of \u00a7 2.2 (b) of the employment agreement, and the parties\u2019 application of it to determine that the plaintiff was owed $28,833 for the first bonus period. The trial court then credited the plaintiffs testimony and utilized the Digital Group financial statement prepared by Suzanne Berry for purposes of the bonus negotiations, concluding that the plaintiff was entitled to $50,329, which is the projected annual profit, less the $28,833 already paid for the first half of the fiscal year and the $8000 that the plaintiff already had been paid toward the second bonus. Moreover, the trial court rejected the defendant\u2019s claim that it was improper to calculate the bonus using the budget, rather than the final audited figures. The trial court concluded that the defendant was \u201cbound by\u201d its choice of the word \u201cbudget\u201d in drafting the employment agreement, ostensibly because the final audited statement \u201cwould not be ready in time for the scheduled bonus payments.\u201d Applying that same formula to plaintiffs exhibit four, which served as the budget for the third bonus period from July 1,2004, through December 31, 2004,<footnotemark>36</footnotemark> due on February 15, 2005, the trial court concluded that the plaintiff was entitled to a bonus of $67,397.<footnotemark>37</footnotemark></p>\n<p id=\"b203-4\"><page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"183\">*183</page-number>\u201cThe intent of the parties as expressed in a contract is determined from the language used interpreted in the light of the situation of the parties and the circumstances connected with the transaction. . . . [T]he intent of the parties is to be ascertained by a fair and reasonable construction of the written words and . . . the language used must be accorded its common, natural, and ordinary meaning and usage where it can be sensibly applied to the subject matter of the contract. . . . Where the language of the contract is clear and unambiguous, the contract is to be given effect according to its terms.

The ordinary meaning of the term \u201cbudget\u201d as a noun contemplates a forward-looking financial plan, based on estimates. See Merriam-Webster Collegiate Dictionary (10th Ed. 1993) (defining \u201cbudget\u201d as, inter alia, \u201ca statement of the financial position of an administration for a definite period of time based on estimates of expenditures during the period and proposals for financing them\u201d or \u201ca plan for the coordination of resources and expenditures\u201d or \u201cthe amount of money that is available for, required for, or assigned to a particular purpose\u201d); cf. id.

We agree with the plaintiff that the defendant, as drafter of the employment agreement, could have exercised its superior bargaining position to draft a more favorable provision. See <em>Ravetto </em>v. <em>Triton Tha-lassic Technologies, Inc., </em>285 Conn. 716, 741, 941 A.2d 309 (2008) (noting \u201cthe superior bargaining power of an employer that enters into an employment contract with an employee\u201d given \u201cthe economic compulsion facing those in search of employment\u201d [internal quotation marks omitted]). We further agree that the trial court\u2019s assessment of the defendant\u2019s interpretation of the employment contract as nothing more than a case of buyer\u2019s remorse following the Berrys\u2019 realization that the agreement \u201cwas less favorable to them than they thought,\u201d was reasonable.</p>\n<p id=\"b204-5\">We next turn to the trial court\u2019s application of the contractual provision to calculate the plaintiffs bonuses, and note that \u201c[t]he determination of damages involves a question of fact that will not be overturned unless it is clearly erroneous. ... In a case tried before a court, the trial judge is the sole arbiter of the credibility of the witnesses and the weight to be given <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"185\">*185</page-number>specific testimony. ...

Utilizing column I of plaintiffs exhibit nine, which Suzanne Berry had utilized dining the defendant\u2019s discussions with the plaintiff for the purpose of calculating the second bonus, the trial court noted that the profit after expenses for the fiscal year was $87,162. Since the plaintiff already had received $28,833 for the first half of that fiscal year, the trial court properly concluded that he was entitled to an annual bonus for the remainder of that fiscal year of $50,329, which represented the difference between the Digital Group\u2019s profit of $87,162 and the bonus already paid, reduced further by the $8000 that the plaintiff already had received. See footnote 8 of this opinion. The trial court also reasonably could have credited the plaintiffs testimony that, given the plain language of \u00a7 2.2 of the employment agreement, as well as the fact that $30,000, or 30 percent of his salary, already had been allocated to the expenses of the Digital Group, the defendant should not have included additional salary adjustments ultimately to reduce the bonus owed. Applying a similar calculation to plaintiffs exhibit four, the Digital Group\u2019s audited financial statement for the fiscal year July 1, 2004, to <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"186\">*186</page-number>June 30, 2005, the trial court properly found that the plaintiff was entitled to a bonus of $67,397. We conclude, therefore, that the trial court\u2019s bonus calculations were not clearly erroneous.<footnotemark>38</footnotemark></p>\n<p id=\"b206-5\">rv</p>\n<p id=\"b206-6\">Finally, we address the defendant\u2019s claims that the trial court improperly: (1) rejected its accord and satisfaction defense with respect to the second bonus; and (2) rejected its defense that the parties had entered into a substitute contract under which the plaintiff had waived his claim with respect to the third bonus.</p>\n<p id=\"b206-7\">A</p>\n<p id=\"b206-8\">The defendant first claims that the trial court improperly rejected the defendant\u2019s accord and satisfaction special defense with respect to the second bonus, claiming that: (1) it had proposed to the plaintiff a bonus payment of $8000;<footnotemark>39</footnotemark> (2) the plaintiff accepted and processed this payment; and (3) this transaction discharged the defendant from any outstanding bonus payment obligation originally due on August 15, 2004. In response, the plaintiff contends that the trial court\u2019s rejection of the accord and satisfaction defense was not clearly erroneous because: (1) there was no good faith dispute about the amount owed; (2) he did not <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"187\">*187</page-number>accept the defendant\u2019s offer of accord; and (3) he did not accept the bonus payment in full satisfaction of his claim for a greater bonus payment. We agree with the plaintiff that the trial court properly determined that he had not accepted the defendant\u2019s offer of accord.</p>\n<p id=\"b207-5\">\u201cWhen there is a good faith dispute about the existence of a debt or about the amount that is owed, the common law authorizes the debtor and the creditor to negotiate a contract of accord to settle the outstanding claim. . . . An accord is a contract under which an obligee promises to accept a stated performance in satisfaction of the obligor\u2019s existing duty. . . . Upon acceptance of the offer of accord, the creditor\u2019s receipt of the promised payment discharges the underlying debt and bars any further claim relating thereto, if the contract is supported by consideration. . . . Although the case law presents the more usual use of accord and satisfaction as a defense by the debtor against the creditor, it is evident that accord and satisfaction equally applies to both parties. Accord and satisfaction is a method of discharging a claim whereby the parties agree to give and accept something other than that which is due in settlement of the claim and to perform the agreement. . . . Indeed, a validly executed accord and satisfaction precludes a party from pursuing any action involving the original, underlying claim. . . . The defendant bears the burden of proving accord and satisfaction when it is pleaded as a special defense.\u201d (Citations omitted; internal quotation marks omitted.) <em>Schoonmaker v. Lawrence Brunoli, Inc., </em>265 Conn. 210, 277, 828 A.2d 64 (2003). \u201cA contract of accord and satisfaction is sufficiently supported by consideration if it settles a monetary claim that is unliquidated in amount.\u201d <em>County Fire Door Corp. </em>v. <em>C.F. Wooding Co., </em>202 Conn. 277, 282, 520 A.2d 1028 (1987).</p>\n<p id=\"b207-6\">A trial court\u2019s determination with respect to whether a claim has been discharged by accord and satisfaction <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"188\">*188</page-number>is a question of fact subject to the clearly erroneous standard of review. <em>Douthwright </em>v. <em>Northeast Corridor Foundations, </em>72 Conn. App. 319, 323-24, 805 A.2d 157 (2002); see also <em>M.J. Daly &amp; Sons, Inc. </em>v. <em>West Haven, </em>66 Conn. App. 41, 48, 783 A.2d 1138 (\u201c[wjhether a meeting of the minds has occurred is a factual determination\u201d), cert. denied, 258 Conn. 944, 786 A.2d 430 (2001).</p>\n<p id=\"b208-4\">Having reviewed the record, we conclude that the trial court\u2019s finding that the defendant did not prove its special defense of accord and satisfaction with respect to the second bonus was not clearly erroneous. Even if we assume that the dispute between the parties over the amount owed was in good faith, and that the November 16, 2004 letter from the defendant to the plaintiff constituted an \u201coffer of compromise\u201d in the amount of $8000 and an amended employment contract, the trial court nevertheless found that the plaintiff had not accepted the defendant\u2019s offer of accord. Specifically, the trial court found that, although the plaintiff had received an $8000 payment from the defendant; see footnote 8 of this opinion; he \u201cnever signed [the proposed employment] contract amendment\u201d and he \u201cdid not accept the exact terms of the compromise offered by [the defendant].\u201d Moreover, the trial court credited the plaintiffs testimony at trial that he only \u201ctook the $8000 because he was in financial trouble and in no way agreed to that being the full satisfaction of his claim for bonus compensation.\u201d Because this factual finding is supported by the record, we decline to disturb the trial court\u2019s credibility determination and conclusion with respect to accord and satisfaction. See, e.g., <em>Schoonmaker </em>v. <em>Lawrence Brunoli, Inc., </em>supra, 265 Conn. 277-79.</p>\n<p id=\"b208-5\">B</p>\n<p id=\"b208-6\">The defendant also contends that the trial court improperly rejected its ninth special defense and con-<page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"189\">*189</page-number>eluded that the merger clause of the 2005 contract, which replaced the employment agreement, did not operate to \u201c[negate] any claim for a bonus payable after the effective date of the substitute agreement,\u201d specifically the third bonus. In response, the plaintiff contends that the substitute contract special defense was \u201cnot clearly [pleaded] as such,\u201d and that the defendant\u2019s briefing at trial \u201creified] only on the law of accord and satisfaction, not the law of substitute contracts or novations,\u201d and was not directed at the February 15, 2005 bonus. The plaintiff also contends that the trial court necessarily rejected this special defense because it found that the 2005 contract had a different scope\u2014 namely, his employment after January 3, 2005 \u2014 and, therefore, \u201ceasily subsisted with the wages that vested under the [employment agreement].\u201d We agree with the plaintiff and conclude that the 2005 contract did not affect his rights to compensation under the 2003 employment agreement.</p>\n<p id=\"b209-5\">Specifically, the defendant relies on \u00a7 6.3 of the 2005 contract, which provides: \u201cThis [a]greement contains the entire understanding of the parties. There are no oral understandings, terms or conditions, and no party has relied upon any representative, express or implied, not contained in this [agreement.\u201d The defendant then notes that the 2005 contract eliminated the bonus provision of the employment agreement and further reduced the plaintiffs duties.</p>\n<p id=\"b209-6\">\u201cParties may alter any term of an existing contract by entering into a subsequent contract. . . . The contract as modified becomes a new contract between the parties.\u201d (Citation omitted; internal quotation marks omitted.) <em>Spicer </em>v. <em>Spicer, </em>33 Conn. App. 152, 159, 634 A.2d 902 (1993), cert. denied, 228 Conn. 920, 636 A.2d 850 (1994). \u201cThe meaning to be given subsequent agreements . . . depends on the intention of the parties. As intention is an inference of fact, the conclusion is not reviewable unless it was one which the trier <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"190\">*190</page-number>could not reasonably make.\u201d (Internal quotation marks omitted.) <em>Harris Calorific Sales Co. </em>v. <em>Manifold Systems, Inc., </em>18 Conn. App. 559, 564, 559 A.2d 241 (1989).</p>\n<p id=\"b210-5\">We agree with the trial court\u2019s determinations that the language of the 2005 contract does not refer in any way to \u201cbonuses under the 2003 [employment agreement],\u201d and that, although the defendant could have drafted the 2005 contract in a way that would have required the plaintiff to \u201cforgo his previously earned bonuses in consideration for his new employment contract,\u201d it simply failed to do so. Thus, because the language of the 2005 contract did not expressly address the defendant\u2019s obligations to pay wages earned during the third bonus period that had ended on December 31, 2004, prior to the effective date of the 2005 contract, we conclude that the trial court properly rejected the defendant\u2019s ninth special defense. See, e.g., <em>Flagg Energy Development Corp. </em>v. <em>General Motors Corp., </em>244 Conn. 126, 145, 709 A.2d 1075 (1998) (rejecting contract modification claim because \u201cthe language of the 1990 settlement agreement did not . . . supersede or extinguish the warranty obligations contained in the 1987 purchase agreement\u201d); <em>Spicer </em>v. <em>Spicer, </em>supra, 33 Conn.

A payment to any person of a smaller amount of wages than the wage set forth in any written wage agreement or the repayment of any part of any wages received, if such repayment is not made in the payment of a debt evidenced by an instrument in writing, shall be prima facie evidence of a violation of this section.</p>\n<p id=\"b176-9\">\u201c(c) The provisions of this section shall not apply to any deductions from wages made in accordance with the provisions of any law, or of any rule or regulation made by any governmental agency.</p>\n<p id=\"b176-10\">\u201c(d) Any person who violates any provision of this section shall be fined not more than one hundred dollars or imprisoned not more than thirty days for the first offense, and, for each subsequent offense, shall be fined not more than five hundred dollars or imprisoned not more than six months or both.\u201d</p>\n</footnote>\n<footnote label=\"14\">\n<p id=\"b176-11\"> The trial court, <em>Graham, J., </em>had granted the plaintiffs motion to cite in Peter Berry as a counterclaim defendant.

The Labor Commissioner may collect the full amount of any such unpaid wages, payments due to an employee welfare fund or such arbitration award, as well as interest calculated in accordance with the provisions of section 31-265 from the date the wages or payment should have been received, had payment been made in a timely manner. In addition, the Labor Commissioner may bring any legal action necessary to recover twice the full amount of unpaid wages, payments due to an employee welfare fund or arbitration award, and the employer shall be required to pay the costs and such reasonable attorney\u2019s fees as may be allowed by the court.

Id.</p>\n</footnote>\n<footnote label=\"26\">\n<p id=\"b187-5\"> The defendant contends that <em>B.N. Realty Associates </em>v. <em>Lichtenstein, </em>supra, 21 App. Div. 3d 793, is distinguishable on the ground that the court \u201cbolstered\u201d its conclusion by noting that the bankruptcy petition therein at least disclosed the pendency of the underlying action itself, if not the counterclaims at issue. Id., 798 n.2. As the defendant points out, there apparently is an interdepartmental split in New York\u2019s Appellate Divisions with respect to this issue, yet to be resolved by the state\u2019s highest court, as the Second Department has relied on that distinction to distinguish <em>B.N. Realty Associates. </em>Specifically, in <em>Nationwide Associates, Inc. </em>v. <em>Epstein, </em>24 App. Div. 3d 738, 739, 809 N.Y.S.2d 118 (2005), appeal withdrawn, 7 N.Y.3d 899, 860 N.E.2d 70, 826 N.Y.S.2d 608 (2006), the Second Department of the Appellate Division relied on <em>Kunica </em>v. <em>St. Jean Financial, Inc., </em>supra, 233 B.R. 46, and <em>Best </em>v. <em>MetLife Auto &amp; Home Ins. Co., </em>7 Misc. 3d 242, 793 N.Y.S.2d 682 (2004), also relied upon by the defendant herein, and concluded that: \u201cThe fact that [the plaintiffs] bankruptcy proceeding was dismissed rather than discharged does not alter the effect of [the plaintiffs] failure to disclose the [legal malpractice] claim it now seeks to assert here . . . .\u201d (Citations omitted.) <em>Nationwide Associates, Inc. </em>v. <em>Epstein, </em>supra, 739. The court then distinguished <em>B.N. Realty Associates, </em>by noting that, in that case, \u201cthe petitioner in bankruptcy had disclosed the pendency of the action in which his counterclaims were asserted . . . [and] there is no evidence in this record from which we can conclude that the other parties to [the plaintiffs] bankruptcy proceeding would have been able, with some investigation, to discover the claims that [the plaintiff] failed to disclose.\u201d Id.</p>\n<p id=\"b187-6\">In our view, the First Department\u2019s decision in <em>B.N. Realty Associates </em>is more persuasive. First, the Second Department\u2019s decision in <em>Nationwide Associates, Inc., </em>is a summary decision that is not informative with respect to the nature or progress of the bankruptcy proceedings therein, and fails to account for either 11 U.S.C. \u00a7 349 (b) (3) or the court\u2019s observation in <em>Kunica </em>that, in that case, the dismissal was the \u201cfunctional equivalent\u201d of a discharge. Accordingly, without a decision to the contrary from the New York Court of Appeals, we will follow the reasoning of the First Department\u2019s decision in <em>B.N. Realty Associates. </em>But see also <em>Kilpatrick </em>v. <em>Kilpatrick, </em>205 S.W.3d 690, 702 (Tex. App. 2006) (\u201cwe accept the reasoning of <em>Kunica </em>and hold that only disclosed assets will be revested to the debtor upon the dismissal of a bankruptcy proceeding\u201d), review denied, 2007 Tex.

In the context of nondisclosure of pending claims to a bankruptcy court, several circuit courts have held that failure to fully disclose such claims will only be deemed inadvertent or due to mistake when either the debtor has no knowledge of the claims or no motive to conceal the claims.\u201d <em>Galin </em>v. <em>Internal Revenue Service, </em>supra, 563 F. Sup. 2d 340, citing, inter alia, <em>Eastman </em>v. <em>Union Pacific Railroad Co., </em>493 F.3d 1151, 1158 (10th Cir. 2007); <em>Barger </em>v. <em>Cartersville, </em>348 F.3d 1289, 1296 (11th Cir. 2003); see also <em>Galin </em>v. <em>Internal Revenue Service, </em>supra, 341 (\u201c[cjourts have inferred the absence of mistake at the summary judgment stage when a debtor has knowledge of the claim and motive to conceal it\u201d); <em>Galin </em>v. <em>Internal Revenue Service, </em>supra, 341 (\u201clegal advice and ignorance of the law are not defenses to judicial estoppel\u201d). But see Ryan <em>Operations G.P. </em>v. <em>Santiam-Midwest Lumber Co., </em>81 F.3d 355, 364 (4th Cir. 1996) (concluding that \u201cpolicy considerations militate against adopting a rule that the requisite intent for judicial estoppel <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"172\">*172</page-number>can be inferred from the mere fact of nondisclosure in a bankruptcy proceeding\u201d and noting that \u201c[w]hile we by no means denigrate the importance of full disclosure or condone nondisclosure in bankruptcy proceedings, we are unwilling to treat careless or inadvertent nondisclosures as equivalent to deliberate manipulation when administering the \u2018strong medicine\u2019 of judicial estoppel\u201d). Given the lack of evidence in the record with respect to any manipulative intent by the plaintiff, and the defendant\u2019s failure in its principal or reply briefs to cite any of the cases limiting the availability of the inadvertence or good faith exceptions to judicial estoppel in the bankruptcy context, we decline to rely on them as a basis for upsetting the trial court\u2019s exercise of its discretion.</p>\n</footnote>\n<footnote label=\"29\">\n<p id=\"b194-5\"> In discussing <em>Truelove </em>v. <em>Northeast Capital &amp; Advisory, Inc., </em>supra, 95 N.Y.2d 220, we noted that the New York Court of Appeals had concluded that the bonus therein was not a wage because, \u201cthe \u2018terms of the [firm\u2019s] bonus compensation plan did not predicate bonus payments upon [the employee\u2019s] own personal productivity nor give [the employee] a contractual right to bonus payments based upon his productivity. To the contrary, the declaration of a bonus pool was dependent solely upon his employer\u2019s overall financial success. In addition, [the employee\u2019s] share in the bonus pool was entirely discretionary and subject to the non-reviewable determination of his employer.\u2019 Id., 224. Thus, the [New York Court of Appeals] concluded that \u2018the wording of the statute, in expressly linking earnings to an employee\u2019s labor or services personally rendered, contemplates a more direct relationship between an employee\u2019s own performance and the compensation to which that employee is entitled. Discretionary additional remuneration, as a share in a reward to all employees for the success of the employer\u2019s entrepreneurship, falls outside the protection of the statute.\u2019 \u201d <em>Weems </em>v. <em>Citigroup, Inc., </em>supra, 289 Conn. 780-81.</p>\n</footnote>\n<footnote label=\"30\">\n<p id=\"b195-6\"><em> </em>The applicable employment agreement provided that the plaintiff was an employee at will, and that: \u201c \u2018Annual compensation shall be subject to review by the Board of Directors of [the law firm] on the anniversary of employment of [t]he Associate.

See <em>Ziotas </em>v. <em>Reardon Law Firm, P.C., </em>supra, 296 Conn. 591-92.</p>\n</footnote>\n<footnote label=\"32\">\n<p id=\"b198-5\"> We note that the plaintiff was the defendant\u2019s only employee with a contract that gave him an established right to a particular bonus. Peter Berry testified that the defendant\u2019s other employees received bonuses, but that those bonuses were not preestablished by contract. Moreover, Suzanne Berry testified that the structure of the plaintiff\u2019s bonus ultimately became infeasible, as it gave the plaintiff an incentive to act in his own self-interest to increase his own bonus by either overcharging clients or being less generous with the compensation of the staff assigned to the Digital Group.</p>\n</footnote>\n<footnote label=\"33\">\n<p id=\"b198-6\"> If we were to agree with the defendant\u2019s reading of <em>Weems </em>v. <em>Citigroup, Inc., </em>supra, 289 Conn. 780-82, then no management level employee overseeing the work of other employees would ever be entitled to prevail under the wage statutes when bringing a claim to recover an unpaid bonus. There is no indication in the language of the wage statutes or their legislative history that the legislature intended to exclude all management level employees. Compare General Statutes \u00a7 31-71a (2) (defining \u201c \u2018[ejmployee\u2019 \u201d for purposes of wage act as \u201cany person suffered or permitted to work by an employer\u201d), with General Statutes \u00a7 31-58 (f) (defining \u201c \u2018[e]mployee\u2019 \u201d for purposes of minimum fair and overtime wage statute as, inter alia, \u201cany individual employed or permitted to work by an employer but shall not include ... an individual employed in a bona fide executive, administrative or professional capacity as defined in the regulations of the Labor Commissioner\u201d). We therefore decline the defendant\u2019s apparent invitation to do so.</p>\n</footnote>\n<footnote label=\"34\">\n<p id=\"b199-6\"> Thus, the plaintiffs role as the manager of a specific division, and the relationship of the bonus to the financial success of that division, rather than to the success of the defendant as a whole, renders inapposite case law considering bonuses not to be wages because they were tied to the employer\u2019s overall success. See, e.g., <em>Ziotas </em>v. <em>Reardon Law Firm, P.C., </em>supra, 296 Conn. 589. Accordingly, we find misplaced the defendant\u2019s emphasis on the plaintiffs testimony that his bonus amount bore no relation to the number of hours that he worked per week, specifically, that his bonus would be the same if he worked ten hours, or eighty, in a given week.</p>\n</footnote>\n<footnote label=\"35\">\n<p id=\"b201-6\"> The plaintiff also notes that the defendant\u2019s course of conduct, in agreeing with the plaintiffs request for a first bonus of $28,833 in February, 2004, demonstrates the propriety of his calculation method under the contract. If we find \u00a7 2.2 (b) of the employment agreement ambiguous, we agree that the parties\u2019 course of dealing may be used to aid in its interpretation. See <em>Small Business Transportation, Inc. </em>v. <em>ABC Stores, LLC, </em>96 Conn. App. 14, 19, 899 A.2d 73 (2006); see also <em>Highhouse </em>v. <em>Midwest Orthopedic Institute, P.C., </em>supra, 807 N.E.2d 739 (relying on undisputed evidence concerning employer\u2019s course of conduct in calculating and paying bonuses in construing posttermination bonus provision in employment contract).</p>\n</footnote>\n<footnote label=\"36\">\n<p id=\"b202-6\"> The plaintiff testified that he had not consulted with the Berrys in preparing this document because, by that time, his relations with them had deteriorated and they did not want to discuss his bonuses any further.</p>\n</footnote>\n<footnote label=\"37\">\n<p id=\"b202-7\"> The trial court noted that, in bonus negotiations, the plaintiff originally had countered the defendant\u2019s offer of $16,346 with a proposal of $20,000, despite the fact that the plaintiff knew that he was entitled to more. The trial court did not consider the plaintiffs counteroffer dispositive, noting that the budget document indicated that he was entitled to $67,397, and the lower counteroffer was motivated by his need for immediate cash flow in light of personal financial problems that he was experiencing at that time.</p>\n</footnote>\n<footnote label=\"38\">\n<p id=\"b206-9\"> The defendant contends that the trial court\u2019s bonus calculations improperly are not based on an accounting of the Digital Group\u2019s actual profitability, and also do not account for Suzanne Berry\u2019s testimony that some of the figures utilized were derived from the plaintiffs overstatement of certain Digital Group revenues on the basis of, inter alia, overbilling clients. We note that the trial court expressly stated that the bonus payment deadlines set forth in \u00a7 2.2 (b) of the employment agreement essentially compelled the defendant to use the budgeted figures, rather than final audited numbers. With respect to the correctness of the figures on the reports, the defendant in essence asks us to retry the facts, which we decline to do. See, e.g., <em>DuBaldo Electric, LLC v.
