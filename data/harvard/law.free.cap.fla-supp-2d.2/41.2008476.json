However, the record shows that at the time the covenant was entered into in 1969, the ponds were not on any site plans, and in fact were not excavated until 1971, to solve irrigation problems.</p>\n<p id=\"b52-7\">This court finds therefore that there has not been a breach of the covenant as contended by the Appellants.</p>\n<p id=\"b52-8\">For the above reasons, the Order of the Dade County Board of Commissioners is hereby AFFIRMED.</p>\n</opinion>\n</casebody>\n",
