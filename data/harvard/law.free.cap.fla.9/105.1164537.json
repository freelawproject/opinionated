Russ, who was appointed one of his executors, Mary E. Russ, who has since intermarried with Henry Humphreys and Margaret Belle Russ.</summary>\n<summary data-order=\"30\" data-type=\"summary\" id=\"b111-7\">The bill avers, that the complainant is grand-daugliter of the said testator, (Joseph Russ,) being the only child of William H. L. Russ, the son of the said Joseph Russ, who <em>had depended this life i/n the lifetime of his father, the said Joseph </em>IL%iss, and that <em>if the said Joseph Jduss had died in</em>testate., the said Joseph W. Russ, Mary E. Russ, Margaret B. Russ and <em>complwvncmt </em>(Martha J. Russ) would have been entitled to distribution of his estate; that Elizabeth Russ, the widow, and Joseph W. Russ, Mary E. Russ, now Mi\u2019s. Humphreys, and Margaret Belle Russ, <em>his children, were made the principal objects of his bounty </em>by his willing and devising to them the bulk of his estate.</summary>\n<summary data-order=\"31\" data-type=\"summary\" id=\"b111-8\">The bill further alleges, that since the death of the said testator, the said Margaret B. Russ departed this life a minor, not having attained twenty-one years of age, <em>and withoiot issue ; </em>that administration upon her estate has been granted to the said Joseph W. Russ; that her estate is in a situation to be distributed, and that distribution should be made between the said Joseph W. Russ, Mary E. Russ and <em>complcdnant, as the next of Tdn cmd heirs of sedd Margaret J3. JRioss, deceased, </em>they being her heirs and distributees by the laws of Florida.</summary>\n<summary data-order=\"32\" data-type=\"summary\" id=\"b111-9\">The bill charges, that some real and personal estate that was willed and devised to the said Margaret B. Russ by her father was sold to pay the debts due by the estate of the said Joseph Russ, deceased, what property or how much <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"112\">*112</page-number>complainant is unable to state; but tliat, by the terms of the will of the said Joseph Buss, his other children, Joseph <em>~W. </em>Buss and Mary E. Humphreys, are bound to contribute to the estate of the said Margaret 13. Buss, to make up in value the amount for which said property, given her, was sold.</summary>\n<summary data-order=\"33\" data-type=\"summary\" id=\"b112-5\">It is further charged in the hill, that, by the terms of the will of the said Joseph Buss, deceased, the farther of Margaret B. Buss, the said Margaret B. Buss took an <em>absolute estate </em>in the slaves bequeathed her by her father\u2019s will and named therein, and also in the increase of the females, and that she took an <em>absol/ute fee simple </em>title to the land devised to her by her father\u2019s will.</summary>\n<summary data-order=\"34\" data-type=\"summary\" id=\"b112-6\">The bill further alleges, that after the death of Elizabeth Buss, the widow of Joseph Buss, deceased, there was some division of the negro slaves and their increase that were given by said will to the said Elizabeth Buss for life, and at her death to be divided between the said Mary E. Humphreys and Margaret B. Buss, but bow and in what manner said division was made, or what negroes were allotted to the said Margaret B. Buss, she does not know.</summary>\n<summary data-order=\"35\" data-type=\"summary\" id=\"b112-7\">The prayer of the hill is, that said Joseph W. Buss do account, as administrator of Margaret B. Buss, deceased, for all property and assets of the estate of Margaret B. Buss; that the land belonging to Margaret B. Buss at her death he partitioned, by order of the Court, between complainant, Joseph <em>W. </em>Buss and Mary E. Humphreys, if it can be done, if not, sold for the purpose of distribution; that a reference be had to a Master for an account between the administrator Joseph <em>W. </em>Buss and the said estate of Margaret B. Buss, and that a distribution of the estate of Margaret B. Buss, deceased, he decreed between complainant, Joseph IV\". Buss and Mary E. H'unqilireys.</summary>\n<summary data-order=\"36\" data-type=\"summary\" id=\"b112-8\">To tliis hill the defendants demurred, and afterwards the Chancellor made the following decree:</summary>\n<summary data-order=\"37\" data-type=\"summary\" id=\"b112-9\">\u201cThis cause having been previously argued and submitted <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"113\">*113</page-number>\u25a0oil defendants\u2019, demurrer, and the Court now being fully advised of its decree to be rendered herein, it is considered, ordered, adjudged and decreed that the said demurrer be overruled.\u201d</summary>\n<summary data-order=\"38\" data-type=\"summary\" id=\"b113-5\">Whereupon the defendants prayed an appeal.</summary>\n<summary data-order=\"39\" data-type=\"summary\" id=\"b113-6\">The petition of appeal prays a reversal of said .decree for the reasons following:</summary>\n<summary data-order=\"40\" data-type=\"summary\" id=\"b113-7\">1. Because your petitioners are entitled to all the real and personal property which came to the said H. B. Buss upon the death of her mother under and by virtue of the will of her father.</summary>\n<summary data-order=\"41\" data-type=\"summary\" id=\"b113-8\">2. Because they are entitled to one-half part or interest of the said M. B. Buss in the real estate which was bequeathed to the said 3dL B. Buss under'and by the said will.</summary>\n<summary data-order=\"42\" data-type=\"summary\" id=\"b113-9\">3. Because they are entitled to all the property named in the 8th clause of said will by virtue of the limitation contained in the 14th clause of said will.</summary>\n<summary data-order=\"43\" data-type=\"summary\" id=\"b113-10\">4. Because their said demurrer ought to have been sustained.</summary>\n<attorneys data-order=\"44\" data-type=\"attorneys\" id=\"b113-11\"><em>A. II JB'ush </em>for appellants.</attorneys>\n<p data-order=\"45\" data-type=\"legal\" id=\"b113-12\">The proper determination of this-question renders necessary the consideration of the far-famed and celebrated rule in \u201c Shelley\u2019s case.\u201d The rule has been thus defined:</p>\n<p data-order=\"46\" data-type=\"legal\" id=\"b113-13\">\u201c Where the ancestor takes an estate of freehold, either legally or equitably, by deed, will or other writing, and in the same instrument there is a limitation by way of remainder, either with or without the interposition of another estate, of an interest of the same legal or equitable quality to his heirs or the heirs of his body as a class of persons to take in succession from generation to generation, the limitation to the heirs entitles the ancestor to the. whole estate.\u201d \u20224 Kent, 21G.</p>\n<p data-order=\"47\" data-type=\"legal\" id=\"b113-14\">If the eighth clause of this will stood by itself, I admit <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"114\">*114</page-number>that it would be within the rule; but I contend that each and every part of this will should be construed together, so that, if possible, each part may be sustained and form together a consistent and connected whole. \u201c <em>Ui us magis valeat qua/mp&amp;reatP</em></p>\n<p data-order=\"48\" data-type=\"legal\" id=\"b114-5\">\u201c The intention of the testator is the pole star by which the Court should steer in construing wills;\u201d \u201c and we must take the whole will, and as the former words may be enlarged by the latter, so they may also be sustained and qualified or explained by the latter. \"We are not bound to give an absolute technical sense to one part of the language and then reject all other parts as inconsistent with it.\u201d\u20144 Kent, 534; Selden vs. King, 2 Call, 89; 1 Jarman on Wills, 427, 428, 437, 411; Covenhoven vs. Shaler, 2 Paige, 122; Lynch vs. Hill, 6 Munf., 114; Doe ex. dem. Wolf vs. Allcock, 1 B. &amp; Ald., 137; Moseley vs. Massey, 8 East., 149; Sisson et al. vs. Seabury, 1 Sumner, 235, where Justice Story sums up as follows: \u201c And I would add, that in all cases of this sort, if the intention be clear, no authority applicable to other wills ought to preclude the Court from carrying that intention into effect, if it can be done without destroying the settled principles of the law;\u201d page, 258.</p>\n<p data-order=\"49\" data-type=\"legal\" id=\"b114-6\">And our own Supreme Court says, that to arrive at the import of a will, and, that it may be better understood, we may reject expletives and general expressions and throw the three clauses into one.\u2014Merritt and wife vs. Brantley, 8 Flo., 229. Just what should be done in this case. Throw all the clauses into one, or let each clause which affected M. B. Puss be read in connection with the fourteenth clause. It will then be extremely clear what was the intention of the testator.</p>\n<p data-order=\"50\" data-type=\"legal\" id=\"b114-7\">Again, the rule in \u201cShelley\u2019s case\u201d is so exceedingly technical and artificial in its nature, that whenever there has been any, the slightest, difference of phraseology which would justify a departure from the rule, the Judges have <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"115\">*115</page-number>seized upon tlie opportunity of deviating from it in order to arrive at the real intention of the testator. \u2014 See Chief Justice Wilmot\u2019s severe criticism of the rule referred to in Mr.</p>\n<p data-order=\"51\" data-type=\"legal\" id=\"ADz\">Emmett\u2019s argument in Anderson vs. Jackson, 16 Johns. R., 387-8; Doe vs. Collis, 4 Term R., 294, 299. And even Mr. Justice Blackstone was forced to admit that the rule should be controlled by the manifest intention of the testator, for the reason just stated.\u2014Hargrave\u2019s Law Tracts, 489; <em>et vide etiam </em>Royall vs. Eppes, 2 Munf., 482. And to the same effect are many of the cases hereafter cited.</p>\n<p data-order=\"52\" data-type=\"legal\" id=\"b115-5\">Again, I contend that the rule in \u201c Shelley\u2019s case \u201d does not apply, because the several clauses of this will form executory devises and executory bequests.</p>\n<p data-order=\"53\" data-type=\"legal\" id=\"b115-6\">\u201cAn executory devise is a limitation by will of a future contingent interest in lands, contrary to the rules of limitation of contingent estates in conveyances at law.\u201d \u2014 4 Kent, 263.</p>\n<p data-order=\"54\" data-type=\"legal\" id=\"b115-7\">It differs from a remainder in several important respects:</p>\n<p data-order=\"55\" data-type=\"legal\" id=\"b115-8\">1. It requires no particular prior estate to support it.</p>\n<p data-order=\"56\" data-type=\"legal\" id=\"b115-9\">2. By it a remainder may be limited after a lee.</p>\n<p data-order=\"57\" data-type=\"legal\" id=\"b115-10\">3. By it an estate less than a freehold may be limited after a life estate.\u20142 Blackstone, 173 <em>et seq.; </em>2 Kent, 266, 269, 270.</p>\n<p data-order=\"58\" data-type=\"legal\" id=\"b115-11\">And to show that this is an executory devise, I refer to the following English authorities: 1 Jarman on Wills, 778, 780; 2 Roper on Legacies, 1528, 1529, 1546, 1548, 1549, 1550; Pinbury vs. Elkin, 1 P.

Buss, and the heirs of her body,\u201d are such as to create an estate tail in the first instance, and this, we take it, is so beyond cavil. 4 Kent\u2019s Com., 11 and 12.</p>\n<p data-order=\"69\" data-type=\"legal\" id=\"b118-7\">But it is insisted by the appellants that this clause of the <em>will </em>is not to be read by itself, but must be taken in connection with the 14th clause in the will; and, for the present, we will concede that such is the proper reading of the will. Now, does the language used in the 14th clause of the will destroy the estate tail which is clearly created by the language used in the 8th clause? We think not; for we find in the 14th clause the same technical language which creates an estate tail that is used in the 8th clause, in this, <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"119\">*119</page-number>that tlie words used in the 14th clause are, \u201c in the event of the death of J. W. R., M. E. R. or Margaret B. Russ (the legatee in the 8th clause) without heirs of the body,\u201d that the property of the one so dying (which in this case is Margaret B. Russ) is to be equally divided between the survivors.</p>\n<p data-order=\"70\" data-type=\"legal\" id=\"b119-5\">The same language being used in the 14th clause that is used in the 8th clause, and also in the Ytli clause, where property is given to his other daughter, Mary E., indicates shat it was the intention of the testator to create an estate tail as to tlie property given to his daughter, and such intention being repugnant to the rule, the limitation is too remote and therefore void, and the first taker took an absolute property, and, upon her death, passed distributively to her next of kin. Daniels vs. Williamson, 12 Wheaton, 568; 7 Curtis, 362; Broom\u2019s Legal Maxims, 123; 2 Jarman, 418, 444, 448.</p>\n<p data-order=\"71\" data-type=\"legal\" id=\"b119-6\">But it is insisted by the appellants that the word <em>\u201c </em>survivors,\u201d used in the 14th clause, is to be taken in this will as a word superadded to and intended to control the words of indefinite limitation in the 8th clause, \u201c heirs of her body,\u201d and, in the 14th clause, \u201c without heirs of the body of the one so dying,\u201d and to confine that limitation to children living at the death of Margaret B. and Mary E. Russ. But this cannot be so, according to Chancellor Kent, for he lays it down as a rule, that if the executory limitation, either of lands or chattels, be too remote in its commmcemmt, it is void, and cannot be helped by any subsequent event, or by any modification or restriction in the execution of it. 4th Kent\u2019s Com., top page 315.</p>\n<p data-order=\"72\" data-type=\"legal\" id=\"b119-7\">In the case of Eosdick vs. Cornell, 1 John., p. 451, where a limitation was held to be a good executory devise, being controlled by the word \u201c survivors,\u201d it is admitted in the opinion of the Court, that if the intention of the testator had appeared in the first instance to give an estate tail, that <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"120\">*120</page-number>that intention would have controlled and the limitation would have been too remote.</p>\n<p data-order=\"73\" data-type=\"legal\" id=\"b120-5\">It is true it has been held in some instances, that, in a bequest of chattels, slight and unimportant words in the will may be taken hold of to ascertain, where the intention of the testator is not clearly expressed, his intention to limit the estate over.</p>\n<p data-order=\"74\" data-type=\"legal\" id=\"b120-6\">But this rule could only apply when the intention of the testator is not clearly expressed in any event. The English rule seems to be, and such is the rule of law here, as recognized in the case of Watts, adm\u2019r, vs. Clardy, 2 Flo. Reps., 386, that a devise in fee with remainder over, if the devisee dies without issue or heirs of the body, is a fee cut down to an estate tail, and the limitation over is void by way of executory devise as being too remote and founded on indefinite failure of issue. Chancellor Kent says than the American authorities are to the same effect. 4 Kent\u2019s Com., 276, (9 Paige, 265.) Chancellor Kent further remarks, that the English rule has been adhered to, and has not been permitted, either in England or in this country, to be affected by such variation in the limitation over as <em>\u201c </em>dying without leaving issuenor, if the devise was to two or more persons, and either should die without issue, the survivor should take. 4 Kent\u2019s Com., 277, (side page.)</p>\n<p data-order=\"75\" data-type=\"legal\" id=\"b120-7\">We are of the opinion, that, when the cases are examined, it will be found that whenever a limitation over to survivors is held to be good by way of executory devise, they will be found to be cases in which the devisee or legatee in the first instance took an estate in fee or life estate only, and not an estate in fee tail, as in the case at ba<em>r </em>and we deem the cases of Threadgill vs. Ingram, 1 Iredell\u2019s Reports, p. 577, and Zollicoffer vs. Zollicoffer, 4 Dev. &amp; Bat., 438, and Gregory vs. Beale, 1 Iredell\u2019s Equity, page 25, as falling within the above rule. Whore there is a bequest of personal property to A and the heirs of his body, as in the case at <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"121\">*121</page-number>bar, the same language would, in a devise of real estate of inheritance, giving an express estate tail, and would give an absolute property in the personal property bequeathed, and any subsequent bequest over without heirs of the body would be of no effect, being too remote. 2 Roper on Legacies, page 1521-2-3. And certainly a bequest over to survivors would not have the effect to change a devise of this character, it being a fee tail to the first taker, into an executory devise, or a limitation not too remote.

In tlie case of Sidnor vs. Sidnor, (2 Munford Reports, 263,) the rule- was applied whore the language of the will is identical with that in the present case, even to the word \u201csurvivors,\u201d and afterwards of Lynch and wife vs. Hill and wife, (G Munford, HI-,) is to the same point. Yvre would also refer the Court to the case of the State for the use of Lester vs. Skinner, (4 Iredell, 58,) where the language in the will was almost precisely similar to that in this ease. Here the Court said: \u201cThere can be no doubt; that the words in the wdi would create an estate tail in lands devised and it is expressly on this ground that the Court decided that the limitation over was too remote, and that J. W. Russ took an obsolute estate in the slaves. Tint, say the Court in this case, \u201c an exception to the rule is where there are words superadded to those which, standing by themselves, would create an estate tail hi lands, which super-ad (led words would show and explain that the testator did not intend to create an estate tail in the chattels. The superadded words, doiibtless, here alluded to are those designated in many of the cases put hi 2d Roper on Legacies, 1528 4. it will be seen, by reference to the case of Anderson vs. Jackson, in JO Johnson, that that case was disposed of on the same ground, and followed the case of Fosdick at-. Cornell, (L Johnson, 440,) and that the opinion and decision in Fosdick vs. Cornell was made under a mistaken view of the English, cases. This Avill appeal\u2019 by the dissenting opinion delivered by the Chancellor in Jackson vs. Anderson, 16 Johnson, who avus outlie bench when the decision in Fosdick vs. Cornell was made, and who says that that ease was decided erroneously, and that the Courts of New York since then have done nothing hut \u00edoIIoav up the error over since.</p>\n<p data-order=\"78\" data-type=\"legal\" id=\"b122-5\">A limitation over of personal property cannot lie made fo laico effect after the expiration of an absolute interest, whether absolute, expressly or by implication. \u2014 Bee will, items <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"123\">*123</page-number>2, 4, 5, 6, 7, 8, 9, 10, 11.

Reps., 181. This is because of the repugnancy. The .property in -many of the items of this will, where the bequest and devise is to J. W. Russ, Mary E. -and Margaret B. Russ is to them in fee, is to them, their heirs and assigns. See the bequest to Jos. W. Russ; it is clear he was intended to be vested with such an interest as he could sell and assign. If so, what becomes of the idea that this will contains an executory devise?</p>\n<p data-order=\"79\" data-type=\"legal\" id=\"b123-4\">We now take the position, that .the last clause of the will is not to exclude the prior devises, if it is inconsistent with the general intention of the testator, which is plainly shown by the general context of the will, (2 Will. on Executors, p. 931,) disclosed by the several <em>independent </em>.and <em>complete estates </em>described in <em>each separate item </em>of the will conveyed by lull and complete technical and legal language.\u20141 Jarman on Wills, \u00a7 420; 4 Williams on Executors, \u00a7 931.

I answer, that here there is no <em>subsequent </em>limitation, but it is created at the same time and in the same will in which it is alleged that the estate tail appears. The signing of the will is \u201c one act, done at one and the same time,\u201d and there can be <em>nothing in the will subsequent thereto. </em>The point made by the learned counsel is applicable to something that transpires after the execution of the will \u2014 to some <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"125\">*125</page-number>event or accident outside- of tlie main design. \u2014 Atkinson vs. Hutchinson, 3 P.

II. L. Euss, a son of the testator, who died in tlio lifetime of the testator and <em>before </em>his will was made, and who is the same person provided for in the <em>eJeveuiJi </em>clause of the will, where she is called \u201cMary Jane Euss,\" claims to he entitled as one of tbe next of kin to a distributive share in the estate which Margaret B. Russ took under the will of the testator upon the ground that the said- Margaret B., by a proper and legal construction of her father\u2019s will, took, an estate in fee in all the real estate and absolutely all tbe personal property which she derived from <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"128\">*128</page-number>said will; that in legal construction the words \u201c heirs of her body,\u201d in the bequest in the 8th clause of the will, mean an indefinite failure of issue, and that, under this bequest, if the statute of this State for abolishing entails had not been passed, Margaret B. Buss would have been seized <em>vafea tml of </em>one undivided third part of the premises, real and personal, as one of the first takers, under the rule in Shelley\u2019s case, which is:</p>\n<blockquote id=\"b128-5\">\u201cWhere the ancestor takes an estate of freehold, either legally or equitably, by deed, will or other writing, and in the same instrument there is a limitation by way of remainder, either with or without the interposition of another estate, of an interest of the same legal or equitable quality, to his heirs or the heirs of his body, as a class of persons to take in succession from generation to generation, the limitation to the heirs entitles the ancestor to the whole estate.\u201d \u2014 1 Coke Rep., 93; 4 Kent\u2019s Com., 216; 2 Jarman on Wills, 243.</blockquote>\n<p id=\"b128-6\">The word <em>hews </em>is a word of limitation, i. e. the ancestor takes the whole estate comprised in this term. Thus, if the limitation be to the heirs of his body, he takes <em>afee tml; </em>if to his heirs general, <em>afee sinvple.</em></p>\n<p id=\"b128-7\">The defendants take the position, that, by a fair and legal construction of the will, all the property given by it to Margaret B. Buss, at her death became the property of her surviving brother and sister, Jos. W. and Mary E. Buss, under and by virtue of restricting words and expressions therein used, from which it can be collected that these words, \u201cheirs of her body,\u201d are used in a more confined, sense, whereby a precise time is fixed by the will for the failure, making it a <em>definite </em>failure of issue, <em>emltocUng </em>the bequest and devise from the rule in Shelley\u2019s case and bringing the same within the rule as to executory devise, which is, <em>\u201c </em>that an estate cannot be entangled by executory devise beyond a life or lives in being, and the further period of twenty-one years, <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"129\">*129</page-number>and. so much over as will meet the case of a posthumous cliild.\u201d \u2014 10 Bingham, 140; 4 Kent Com., 267.</p>\n<p id=\"b129-5\">It is contended, that the superadded words, in the 14th clause of the will, define the <em>intention </em>of the testator and should be made to supply the words \u201cliving at the time of the death\u201d of said Margaret B. Buss, and construe the words \u201c heirs of the body \u201d to mean children.</p>\n<p id=\"AQI\">It is argued, that, in construing the will, the whole will must be taken and considered together, and that the two clauses, the 8th and 14th, should be thrown into one. The two clauses of the will upon which the question of title depends, and are presented for our consideration, thrown into one, read as follows, viz: 8th item. \u201c <em>I gime mid bequeath unto nuy daughter Margan'et B. Buss, and the heirs of her body, </em>the following slaves :\u2022 Penny and her three children, Elsey, Edward and Bebecca, Sarah Ann, David, \"Walter, Joe, little William, little Paul, Ben, Dinah, Susan, Anderson and Gib, and the future increase of said female slaves.\u201d 14th item. <em>\u201cIt is my will, that in the event of the death of Joseph W. Buss, Mary B. Buss or Margan'et B. Buss, without heirs of their body of the one so dying, that his or hen-property be 'divided equally between the </em>survivors ok them.\u201d The question for this Court is, whether the bequest to Margaret B. Buss comes within the rule in Shelley\u2019s case, or whether it will take effect as an executory devise?</p>\n<p id=\"b129-7\">The intention of the testator is the polar star to guide in the construction of a will, which intention does not depend on any particular clause standing by itself, but is to be gathered from the whole will taken together; and where the testator\u2019s intention is manifest it must prevail, if it is not contrary to some positive or settled rule of law'.</p>\n<p id=\"b129-8\">The learned counsel on both sides have exhibited extraordinary research, and in their arguments and briefs have with great ability cited cases and elementary books -which almost <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"130\">*130</page-number>exhaust the subject. As their briefs will be abridged and furnish the reporter to be printed with this decision, we hope we may be excused for enumerating only those authorities cited which are deemed essential in expressing the opinion of the Court and the grounds upon which their decision is based. Having laid down the rule for the construction of this will, the question is, whether there are expressions or circumstances, or both, from which it can be collected that the words \u201cwithout heirs of the body,\u201d and heirs of the body, are used in a more confined sense, and therefore are not to have their legal signification: namely, death without issue generally.</p>\n<p id=\"b130-5\">The words \u201cheirs of the body\u201d are said to be words of art and import heirs <em>ad infovitami, </em>if nothing to restrain is super-added. To <em>restrain </em>here is meant superadded words which fix a definite time for the failure of issue, such as heirs <em>liming at the time </em>of the death of the legatee. The rule in Shelley\u2019s case is not applicable where the testator used the word \u201cheirs\u201d in any other sense than the legal one.</p>\n<p id=\"b130-6\">This will of Joseph Buss, dee\u2019d, presents the case of a father and head of the family providing for his entire household. He begins by making provisions for his wife, secures to her a life estate with remainder to his children, one of his sons being <em>then </em>dead but leaving a child, (the complainant \u2022 in this suit.) lie provides for the grand-child as he did with his own children. He also makes provisions for a stepson, and for his living children. Being, as it would seem, desirous that all who have equal claims upon him, and who stand equal in his affections, should have his property, he limits it \u201cto heirs of the body,\u201d and by the 14th and final clause, superadded words to show that the benefit intended by him to his children was clearly future and contingent,, because they were to take as sv/rvimors, and as survivors, they were to take when any one of them should die without-heirs of the body living at the time of the death. The pre<page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"131\">*131</page-number>\u25a0cise time is fixed, for tlie failure of lieirs. It was at tlie time of tlie death of any <em>one </em>of them. Who would be the <em>sumvimor </em>was a contingency. Could any one of the children have disposed of this property before this contingency happened, to wit: the death without heirs of the body living at the time of the death of one of them? No. Why? Because, up to the time the contingency happened they had but a life estate. The power of alienation was restricted by the intestate until the death of one of them. lie entangled the estate of his children, but he did not entangle it beyond a life or lives in being. Thus he was within the rule of an <em>executory devise.</em></p>\n<p id=\"b131-5\">In taking the will as a whole, what did the father mean ? We think from the expression and situation of the children contained in the will, he meant to <em>gime </em>this property to his three children mentioned in his said will: one-third to Margaret B., his daughter, and to her posterity, if she has any at the time of her death, but, if she has no children, (heirs of her body,) he then meant the property so devised and -bequeathed should go to his surviving children Joseph and Mary, to be equally divided between them. If Mary had died first without children, then to be equally divided between his surviving children Joseph and Margaret; or if Joseph had died first without children, then to be equally divided between his surviving (children. He limited the estate up to the death of one of them to a life estate. The contingency was the death of one of them, and the remaining two children, if they took .the estate of the deceased sister at all, it was as <em>sumvimors. </em>It seems to us the testator said to his three children, who were equally dear to him: Now, if one of you die without children at the time of the death, then the two who shall survive shall have the share of the one that dies; but if \u201cthe one so dying\u201d shall leave at the time of \u201chis or her\u201d death any child or children,.then <em>\u201cMs or her property\u201d </em>shall go to the children of the one so dying. Your fight to the property \u201cof the one so dying\u201d <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"132\">*132</page-number>will be determined when the contingency upon which it depends happens, to wit: at the death of any one of you. Until that contingency happens, so that it may be determined whether you have the share thus willed to the one of you so dying, I restrict the , alienation of any of your bequests. That is to , say, you can none of you alienate the portion I have willed to you until one of you dies. <em>Dv/rmg the Ufe of all of you in being </em>your bequests are entangled. Had he used the term <em>\u201c </em>children \u201d in his will instead of <em>\u201c </em>heirs of the body,\u201d no one could have doubted his intention.</p>\n<p id=\"b132-5\">\u25a0W\"e think the intestate intended that if either of his three children should die without issue living at the time of the death of the one dying that the whole property devised to the three should pass to the <em>swmmors </em>as survivors of them forever, to be equally divided between them.</p>\n<p id=\"b132-6\">Having thus defined what we think was the plain and manifest intention of the intestate, we are next to enquire whether this intention must prevail, or whether it is contrary to some positive or settled rule of law cozzvertizig the intention of the testator to a <em>purpose altogether different </em>from what he intended ? Here is the tumizig poizit of this, whole case. There is no difference of opinion as to the law arising under the rule in Shelley\u2019s case. The multiplicity of cases cited agree on that. The difficulty which has arisen, azid which so much bewilders Courts, is the application of that law; and here we would remark there is a difference between <em>exceptions </em>to the rule azzd <em>exclusions </em>from the rule.</p>\n<p id=\"b132-7\">It is observed by Mr. Hays, in his very clear azid able essay ozi the disposition of real estate, that the cases which, might appear at first sight to furnish exceptions to the rule are ziot cases of exceptions, but of <em>excUisions </em>\u2014 cases in which there was no szich limitation as the rule intends.</p>\n<p id=\"b132-8\">It is said the words u heirs of the body \u201d are words of <em>art, </em>azzd it certainly cannot fail to strike one who may take <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"133\">*133</page-number>pains to read tlie many cases where it is attempted to bring these words within the technical rule and thereby frustrate the purpose of the testator, that they are <em>a/rtfully </em>used; and so common is the thought, where the words \u201c heirs of the body \u201d are used, that the sight alone of those words is enough, without further examination, to establish an <em>entail/ment.</em></p>\n<p id=\"b133-5\">We think, if the rule as to executory devise be kept before us in expounding the will of Joseph Buss, deceased, there can be no difficulty of bringing it within that rule and excluding this will from the rule in Shelley\u2019s case. It will be seen, if we are right in the force to be given to superadded words, the essential quality to support an executory devise exists, namely, in definitively limiting the time when the contingency should happen, to wit: at the death of either of them without heirs of the body, clearly indicated by the words \u201c <em>siorvivors of them.\u201d</em></p>\n<p id=\"b133-6\">Before entering upon the authorities which we think sustain us in construing this to be an executory devise, we will give certain rules to guide us, viz: The construction of the will is to be made on the entire testament, and not merely on disjointed parts of it, and consequently all its parts are to be construed with reference to each other. Hence general words in one part of the will may be restrained in cases where it can be collected from any other part of the wTill that the testator did not mean to use them in their general sense.\u20142 Williams Ex\u2019rs, 927; Douglas, 327. Which was done in Merritt and wife vs. Brantly et al., 8 Florida, 229. See opinion of Chief Justice. See also other cases cited.</p>\n<p id=\"b133-7\">In the English Court of Chancery, decided as late as 1853, (see 21 volume English Law and Equity Reports, page 369,) the Yice Chancellor says: \u201cWords importing a gift to issue, or a gift over on failure of issue, when applied \u25a0 in a will to personal estate, receive a different construction from that which they would receive if applied <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"134\">*134</page-number>to real estate. This difference of construction, well established from the case of Forth vs. Chapman, 1 P. Wms., 664, has qualified the general rule that words which, if applied to real estate, would give an estate tail, when applied to per\u25a0sonalty give the absolute interest. But the distinctions arising from this qualification of the general rule have, in some of the reported cases, unfortunately been overlooked. 'The reverse of this qualification of the general rule .is that the operation of law, independently of express direction, makes real estate descendible, but makes personal estate distributable. The qualification of these rules has therefore been made in order to prevent the intention of testators from being defeated. A testator who gave personal estate to one for life and then to his issue, but if the tenant for life should die without issue, then to another, would, but for this qualification of the general rule, be held to give, not a life interest, but the absolute property to the person whom he described as tenant for life, and the issue, express objects of his bounty, would take nothing by gift from him. The principle of the qualification was to prevent the intention of the testator from being defeated. In a deed, the word \u2018issue\u2019 is a word of purchase. In a will, it is not <em>ex vi teo^niivi </em>to be construed as a word of -limitation, but is, generally speaking, <em>to he construed as a word of purchase or </em>Unrdtation, <em>as may best suit the intention of the testator.'1'1 </em>So in a will in the United States, where estates tail are abolished, the words \u201cheirs of the body,\u201d when found in such -a connection, whether the property willed is personal or real estate, or both, as to lead to the belief the testator meant to confine the failure of issue to a fixed time, the devise must be held \u00a1good as an executory devise.</p>\n<p id=\"b134-5\">Having laid down these general rules, we proceed to the \u25a0'authorities.</p>\n<p id=\"b134-6\">In Hughes vs. Sayer, 1 P. Wms., 584, there was a devise of personal estate, and the surplus of it was given to two <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"135\">*135</page-number>nepliews, and upon <em>either dying without children, then to the-survivor. </em>The Master of the Rolls held the devise over good for the devise must be taken to mean children living <em>at the death </em>of the party, and not a general failure of issue, because the immediate limitation over was to the survivor.</p>\n<p id=\"b135-5\">In Porter vs. Bradley and others, 3 T. R., 143, the Court held, that \u201cIf lands be devised to A, his heirs and assigns forever, and if he <em>die, lea/oi/ng no issue behind </em>him, then over, the limitation over is good by way of executory devise.\u201d Lord Kenyon, Oh. J., in deciding this case, says: \u201cIf indeed only the first words, \u2018leaving no issue,\u2019 had been used,, they, according to the opinion of Lord Macclesfield, in Forth vs. Chapman, must be restrained to leaving issue at the time of his death. And there are even additional words in this case, \u2018leaving no issue <em>behi/icl him,\u2019 </em>winch necessarily import that the testator meant at the \u2018time of his son\u2019s, death.\u2019 Therefore I have not the least doubt but that this is a good executory devise, to- take place within the time allowed by law, which is borrowed by analogy from legal formal limitations, namely for a life or lives in being.\u201d</p>\n<p id=\"b135-6\">In Roe ex dem. vs. Jeffrey, 1 Term. Rep. 589, the Court of King\u2019s Bench held that \u201c under a devise to T. F. and heirs forever, and in case he should depart this life <em>cmd lea/oe no </em>issue, then to,E. M. and S., or the <em>survi/oor </em>or <em>survivors </em>of' them, share and share alike, the devise is a good executory devise.\u201d</p>\n<p id=\"b135-7\">In Atkinson vs. Hutchinson, 3 P. Wms., 261, the Lord Chancellor says: \u201c The dying without issue being confined to a life, makes the limitation over good by way of executory devise.\u201d</p>\n<p id=\"b135-8\">In a case decided in the English Court of Chancery as late-as 1832, (see Ranelagh vs. Ranelagh, 2 Mylne &amp; Keene, 441,) the words of the will were: \u201c <em>In case of the demise of am/y of the abovepci/rties without legitimate issue, thei/r, his or her proportions to be divided equally amongst the </em>survivorsHeld,, <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"136\">*136</page-number>\u201ctliat the presumption <em>prima facia </em>is that the testator had not in his contemplation an <em>indefinite failure of issue.\u201d </em>The Master of the Nolls says: Although the word <em>\u201csurvivors\u201d </em>has been sometimes construed as synonymous with <em>\u201c others,\u201d </em>where the context required it, that .is by no means its natural and ordinary, far less its necessary import. The word \u201c survivors\u201d must be referred, not to the time of the testator\u2019s death, but <em>to the period, of distribution. </em>The word \u201c issue,\u201d as it occurs in this codicil, is synonymous with \u201c children.\u201d</p>\n<p id=\"b136-5\">The words of the will in North vs. Chapman, 1 P. Wms., 664, were: \u201c And if either of his nephews, <em>William or Walter, should depart this Ufe, and lea/oe no issue of their respeeti/oe bodies, </em>then he gave the said premises to the daughter of his brother William, Jane, and the children of his sister, Sibley Price,\u201d upon which the question arose whether the limitation over of the leasehold premises to the children of the devisor\u2019s brother and sister <em>was void as too remote.</em></p>\n<p id=\"b136-6\">Chancellor Parker said: If I devise a term to II, and if 31 die without leaving issue, remainder over, in the vulgar and natural sense, this must be intended if II died without leaving issue at his death, and then the devise over is good; that the word \u201c die\u201d being the last antecedent, the words \u201c without leaving issue\u201d must refer to that. Besides, the testator, who is <em>mops ooncilm, </em>will, under such circumstances, be supposed to speak in the vulgar, common and natural, <em>not in the legal sense. </em>The Court held this a good limitation to C, if A or B left no issue at their death.</p>\n<p id=\"b136-7\">In the will under consideration in the case of Glover vs. Monckton, 3 Bing., 13, there was a devise of real and personal estates, in the first instance for the benefit of the son and daughter of the testator, <em>until they attained twenty-one, </em>or the daughter married, and then to raise \u00a35,000 for her, and then to his son, his heirs, executors, administrators and assigns forever, according to the respective nature of the es<page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"137\">*137</page-number>tates; but as to liis real estate, iu case his son should not live to attain twenty-one, and his daughter should be living at his decease, or in case his son should live to attain such age, and should afterwards <em>die without lawful issue, </em>then to his daughter for life, &amp;c. The Court of Common Pleas certified to the Master of the Nolls that in their opinion the son took an estate in fee in the real estate, with an executory devise over in the event of his dying without issue living at his death.</p>\n<p id=\"b137-5\">Mr. Jarman, in his Treatise on Wills, says with reference to the principle in Glover vs. Monckton: The same principle probably would be considered as extending to any case in which a <em>dying without issue </em>is combined with an event personal to the individual, as the <em>event of his dying without issue </em>and unmarried, or without leaving a husband or wife, (which is the meaning of unmarried <em>\u201c </em>in this situation.\u201d) The case of Doe ex dem. Johnson vs. Johnson, decided in the Court of Exchequer in 1852, (see 16 English Law and Equity Neports, page 552,) is another case in which \u201c dying without lawful issue\u201d was held a <em>definite </em>failure of issue.</p>\n<p id=\"b137-6\">Having noticed the English cases we will now turn to American decisions on this subject.</p>\n<p id=\"b137-7\">The early cases in Virginia made a difference in the restriction of limitation by superadded words between real and personal estate, and in the case of Royall vs. Eppes, 2 Mumf., 479, held the word in respect to a devise over of personal property, viz., negroes, a special word, that would justify the adoption of the restrictive construction.</p>\n<p id=\"b137-9\">In Dunn and Wife vs. Bray, 1 Call, 294, the devise was of slaves and real estate to W and his heirs forever; but if he die and leave no issue, <em>then </em>to C. This limitation to C, so far as slaves were included, was held good as an executory devise, and not too remote. The word <em>then </em>was construed to operate as a definite failure. The Court also held in this <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"138\">*138</page-number>case that in order to annex slaves to lands, it was necessary that <em>co-extensvue estates </em>should be given in both. The next ease was Seldon vs. King, 2 Call, 61, in which there was a divided Court, but the majority defined out of the case before them what shall be construed an estate tail and not an executory devise. The testator devised that if Ms wife be with child, and the said child <em>Woes </em>and prove a <em>male </em>child, and lives to twenty-one years of age, a house shall be built, &amp;c., and after the decease of his mother, then he gives <em>him </em>and the heirs of his body all his lands, houses and appurtenances, both real and personal, forever; but if the child proves a female, and lives till twenty-one or marriage, she shall have one-half his personal estate and all. his lands to her and the heirs of her body forever. But if the said child should die, then he gives to his <em>wife </em>and her heirs forever all his lands, slaves, stocks of cattle, &amp;c., and appoints her and her father executors of lxis will. The child proved to be a daughter. Held, that on the birth of the child she had a vested <em>remcdnder </em>in tail, with remainder in fee to testator\u2019s wife. Pendleton, President, differed with the majority of the Court as to the intention of the testator, and thought it an executory devise of the fee to the wife upon the contingency of the son\u2019s dying without issue under age, or a daughter dying under age unmarried, and which he says he conscientiously believed was his intention.</p>\n<p id=\"b138-5\">The case of Higgenbotham vs. Racker, 2 Call, 265, was next, and this case was not a will, but deed of gift, in which A makes a gift of slaves to his daughter and <em>the hews of her </em>body, and, in case she died without issue \u2014 that is children of her body \u2014 the said slaves to return to the grantor: Held this limitation not too remote, and therefore is good.</p>\n<p id=\"b138-6\">In North Carolina, in the case of Garland vs. Watt, 4 Iredell\u2019s Law Rep., page 287, a testator, having several children, devised to his two sons, W. W. and H. W., a tract of land, to them and their heirs forever. In a subsequent <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"139\">*139</page-number>\u2018clause, after many previous clevises, lie clevises as follows: l\u201cI will, tliat if any of my children die without issue, leaving a wife or husband, it is my will such wife or husband shall be entitled to one-half of the property, the other half to be equally divided between my other children or their heirs.\u201d Held, that the contingent limitations over were good, and therefore that <em>~W. W. </em>and B. <em>W. </em>could <em>not convey an absolute ancl unconditioned estate in fee simple free from these limitations. </em>This case is very similar to the one under consideration, ancl, among other things, sustains us wherein we say that neither Joseph <em>~W. </em>Buss, Mary E. Buss or Margaret B. Buss could convey the clevises to them until the contintingency happened, to wit: the death of one-of them; that their estate was entangled for one life.</p>\n<p id=\"b139-5\">The case of Threadgill and others vs. Ingraim, 1 Iredell, 577, is another case in point. The restricting clause of the will reads as follows: \u201cAncl if either of my children die 'without heirs lawfully begotten, then his or her part to be equally divided between my surviving children ancl their heirs forever.\u201d Held the limitation over in the will was not too remote.</p>\n<p id=\"b139-6\">Zollicoffer vs. Zollicoffer, Devereux &amp; Battle\u2019s Law Reports, vol. 4, page 438, was decided, in 1839. In the will before the Court in that case, a testator devised a certain tract of land to his oldest son, and the balance of his lands to his widow, all his sons and his daughters, ancl in a subsequent clause directed as follows: \u201cAt the death of my said wife, all the land and negroes that may fall to her shall return to J. Z., (one of his sons,) and in case of the death of either of my aforenamed children without a lawful heir, begotten of his or her body, that then his or her part shall be equally divided among the survivors.\u201d It was held, that upon the death of J. Z. without children subsequent to the death of the widow, all the lands which he had acquired .under his -father\u2019s will \u2014 both that part which was given to <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"140\">*140</page-number>him immediately and that which was limited to him -after the death of his mother' \u2014 -went over to his surviving brothers and sisters, and <em>that the Tmnitation roas not too remote. </em>Ruffin, Chief Justice, in delivering the opinion of the Court, says: \u201cWe do not, indeed, recollect that any will lias been before the Court in which real estate was given over to a <em>* SM'woor'1 </em>upon the death of the first taker without issue or heir of the body. But, although there may have been no direct determination as to the effect of that jthrase, we have a principle established, by adjudication upon cogent reasoning, which covers this case and sustains the limitation.\u201d</p>\n<p id=\"b140-5\">The case of Jones vs. Speight, 1 Car. Law Rep., 544, is approved, in which it was held that a devise over of land upon the death of the first taker <em>\u201c without homing </em>issue\u201d was good. \u201cIt was so held,\u201d says Chief Justice Ruffin, \u201cbecause the reason for taking those words in an artificial and technical sense in regard to land did not exist here, since the abolition of entails, more than in regard to chattels. Therefore, in a devise of <em>laud, </em>we must receive them in their <em>natural sense, </em>as they had before been received, in both countries, in personal becjuests.\u201d</p>\n<p id=\"b140-6\">The case of Brantly et al. vs. Whitaker, 5 Iredell\u2019s Law, 225, being cited by counsel for complainant, we will comment uj&gt;on it when we take up that side of the question. &lt; It is sufficient to state here, that it fully sustains the rules laid down by the Court in determining this to be an executory devise.</p>\n<p id=\"b140-7\">In South Carolina, the leading case, Keating and wife vs. Reynolds, 1 Bay, 79, was as follows: A having two daughters, B and C, devises to each of them and to the <em>hews of thew body </em>forever certain personal chattels, <em>but </em>if they, the said B and C, should <em>ci\u00f1e without homing a lawful heir of their body to lime, </em>then he devised the said chattels to be <em>\u201c </em>equally divided to the survivors.\u201d B marries and has issue now alive; C likewise marries and has a child born alive, <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"141\">*141</page-number>but which dies a few days after its birth, and, after its death, C, the mother, dies without .leaving any issue <em>alive at the time of her death. </em>The Court held that the limitation over to 13 was not a limitation <em>over after cm indefinite faihvre of issue, </em>and therefore good.</p>\n<p id=\"b141-5\">As we think this case strongly resembles the Russ will under consideration, we may be pardoned for extracting some of the opinion of the Court. The Court say: \u201c The will gives the negroes in question to Martha Thorpe, but upon the contingency of her leaving no ehild/ren, (for the words \u2018heirs of the body to live\u2019 mean <em>ehild/ren, </em>if they mean anything,) then to the <em>survwor. </em>This term \u2018 survivor \u2019 is a term of much import here. It carries with it the idea of the longest liver, provided the other sister should leave no children behind her \u2014 that is, none living at the time of her death; for, if she had left a child, that child, or those claiming under it, must have taken. But, as there was none living, then she who should survive was the person to take. This, then, is not a limitation depending upon a remote, but a very limited, contingency \u2014 one which was to happen in a very short period during the life of a person then living, .and cannot be called a limitation after an <em>indefinite fadlw-e of issue </em>to a person not then <em>in esse; </em>and the limitation over upon the contingency of her leaving no children, to the survivor, is a sufficient description of the person he meant should take, so as to bring this case within the rules of law in support of the limitation.\u201d</p>\n<p id=\"b141-6\">In Jones vs. Price, 3 Dess., 165, it was held, that where the intention of the testator appears to be plain that the devise over should take effect after dying without issue of the first devisee, the Court will give effect to such intention and not readily construe the limitation too remote.</p>\n<p id=\"b141-7\">In Clifton vs. Exrs. of Haig, 4 Dess., 330, a testator devised the residue of his real and personal estate to his daughter and the issue of her body lawfully begotten forever; but, in case <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"142\">*142</page-number>of tiie death or failure of issue of his son and daughter, then and in either of these cases, he devised and bequeathed the same to his nephews, S. W. and T. B., to be equally divided between them. Held, the limitations over are not too remote.</p>\n<p id=\"b142-5\">In .the case of Badler vs. Harden, 6 Richardson\u2019s Equity Reports, 147, the Court held as above.</p>\n<p id=\"b142-6\">In Alabama, Pennsylvania and Georgia the same law is \u25a0laid down.</p>\n<p id=\"b142-7\">In Mississippi, (see 12 Smedes &amp; Marshall, 231, Rucker et al. vs. Lambdin et al.,) the words of the will were: \u201cI wish the property which I bequeath and bestow on Sarah A. Treely to be given and secured to herself and her bodily heirs, should she marry, and at her death, should she have no issue, it is to go to her brothers and sisters.\u201d Held, that this was not an estate tail, but an executory devise.</p>\n<p id=\"b142-8\">The adjudications in New York arising upon devises of this kind were examined by the Supreme Court of the United States in Jackson vs. Chew, 12 Wheaton, 153, and found settled by a uniform series of adjudications that the limitation over was good as an executory devise. It is true Chancellor Kent differed from the majority of the Court in Anderson vs. Jackson, 16 Johnson. 397, and made a reference to Fosdick vs. Cornell, 1 Johnson, 440, and Jackson vs. Blanshaw, 3 Johnson, 289, which he says he decided or were decided on mistaken grounds, yet he did not succeed in convincing the Court that they were thus decided. On the \u2022contrary, they decided that the provisions of the will, which were, \u201cIt is my will that if either of my said sons should depart this life <em>without lawful </em>issue, his share or part shall go to the <em>swrvivorf </em>was a good limitation over in-fee by way \u2022of executory devise to the survivor on failure of issue living \u00a1at the death of either of the sons. And, in the case of Lion vs. Burtiss, 20 Johnson, 483, decided four years after .the case of Anderson vs. Jackson, the Court held <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"143\">*143</page-number>the same thing, notwithstanding the recantation of Chancellor Kent. The opinion of the Court in this last case was delivered by Spencer, C. J., and was unanimous \u2014 in which, Mr. Spencer says: <em>\u201cImust be allowed to say that subsequent reflection has eonfl/rmed my conviction of the sound/ness of the decision of the Court of Errors.\u201d</em></p>\n<p id=\"b143-5\"><em>We </em>will pass over the early eases in New York in which Lord Kenyon is said by Chancellor Kent to have been the blind guide that misled them, and rely upon the case of Moffitt vs. Strong, 10 Johnson, 16. This case was not repudiated by Chancellor Kent, but one in which he says he considered <em>fully </em>and decided \u201cafter great deliberation.\u201d The words of the will were, <em>\u201cIf any of the sons shtoidd die without lawful issue, then his yrn't to go to the survivors.\u201d </em>Says Kent, C. J., in delivering the opinion of the Court: \u201c The intent of the testator, according to the settled legal construction of terms, appears then in this case to have been to provide for the surviving sons on the contingency of either of the sons dying leaving no issue at his death, and as this intention is consistent with the rules of law, the limitation over is good by way of executory devise.\u201d The rest of the Court concurred in the opinion.</p>\n<p id=\"b143-6\">In Connecticut, see Morgan vs. Morgan, 5 Day\u2019s Reports,page 517, by will in that case, A devised his real estate to-his sons, B, C, D and E, their heirs and assigns forever, and added a clause to liis will, that in case either of his sons-should \u201c die without children, his brothers should have his-part in equal proportion.\u201d Held, that the limitation over was good by way of executory devise. Held, also, that by the words \u201cdie without children\u201d is intended <em>dying withhold children living at the death of the first devisee.\u201d</em></p>\n<p id=\"b143-7\">There 3vere nine Judges who sat in the Supreme Court of.\u2018 Errors on the adjudication of this case, and were unanimous-in their decisions. Edmund, J., in delivering the opinion of the Court, says: \u201c The time when the contingency corn<page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"144\">*144</page-number>templated was to take effect, if ever, was on the death of one of the four brothers, and not an indefinite period. This is apparent from the words of the disposition itself, \u2018And also my will is that if my sons should either of them die without children, <em>that his brothers shall home his part in equal proportion.\u2019\u2019 </em>Who, then, is to take on the happening of the contingency, that is, on dying without children <em>% </em>The words of the clause give the answer, \u2018his brothers shall have his part in equal portions\u2019 \u2014 brothers then in being, confining the operation of this disposition to the time of the death of one son, living the others, in direct opposition to the idea of waiting the event of an indefinite failure of issue.\u201d</p>\n<p id=\"b144-5\">In Hart vs. Thompson, administrator, in 3 B. Munroe\u2019s Kentucky Reports, page 487, the will was a devise to all the testator\u2019s children tobe equally divided; <em>11 but should either die without hews of their </em>body, <em>lawfully </em>begotten, <em>that their pa/rt so allotted and given to them as aforesaid to be equally divided amongst my other ehildren then liming.'\u201d</em></p>\n<p id=\"b144-6\">The Court say: \u201cAccording to the strictest rule of English interpretation, we cannot regard the devise in question as a limitation over after an indefinite failure of issue, which would constitute it an estate tail, but as a limitation over upon a fee, which vests the estate in the surviving children? upon the death of either without issue living at his or her death, and is good as an executory devise.\u201d On the part of the complainant it is contended the testator <em>intended </em>a limitation over after an indefinite failure of issue, and therefore an estate tail; that there are no expressions or circumstances in the will, which, in giving them their legal import, would show the testator looked to the death of any one of them as the definite period at which the contingency should happen.</p>\n<p id=\"b144-7\">We have examined the numerous authorities cited by the able counsel for complainant and well considered the arguments urged in applying them to this case and the conclu<page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"145\">*145</page-number>sions urged, and while there .are contradictory opinions which we shall not attempt to reconcile, tljpy all agree that if there is anything in the will to authorise the change of the rule of legal construction of words, that then the Court should do so, to carry out the intention of the testator. As a condensed brief, with the authorities of counsel for complainant, will be published with the report of this case, we will only mention a few leading ones.</p>\n<p id=\"b145-5\">The case of Brantly vs. Whitaker, 5 Iredell, 225, was as follows: A, by will, devised land to his two daughters, II B and S B to them and their heirs, \u201c and if they should die -without an heir, <em>then </em>to his wife, B. One daughter died without issue. Held, that the limitation over was too remote.</p>\n<p id=\"b145-6\">But the Court say: \u201c If the limitation over had vested on the event that the two daughters died without children, it would have been a good limitation, as that event must necessarily have been known during the life or lives of persons in being or twenty-one years thereafter. But the word <em>hew, </em>used by the testator, cannot be construed <em>children, </em>as there is nothing <em>in the will </em>to authorize us to change its technical signification.\u201d It will be observed that the Court intended that if there was anything in the will which would authorize the <em>change of its technical </em>signification, it would be done. In the case at bar we think there are expressions .and circumstances in the will which authorize us to change the technical signification of the words \u201c heirs of the body\u201d to children, and fix the period of failure of issue to the time of the death. Whether or not the will authorizes such a change is the turning point in this case, as it is in all others where conflicting opinions have been <em>given </em>\u2014 each <em>case </em>depending upon the peculiar expressions and entire provisions of the will \u2014 and so long as the intention of the testator is thus arrived at, there will be apparent conflicting opinions,</p>\n<p id=\"b145-7\">In the case of Allen and Wife vs. White, Administrator <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"146\">*146</page-number>of Rufus Mills, 16 Alabama, 181, the peculiar expression in that will was, \u201c <em>1)6 hept for the mawitamamce of my </em>son, <em>his famil/y amd lawful </em>children, <em>which he now has or ma/y hereafter home </em>and the <em>swvivor </em>of them.\u201d</p>\n<p id=\"b146-5\">The wife o\u00ed the son claimed the slaves as survivor. The Court lays down the rule of executory devise as we have and goes on to say: \u201c Now, if the words <em>\u2018 siorvivor of </em>them\u2019 create 'a limitation good as an executory devise, the property may be tied up and rendered inalienable for more than fifty years after the death of all the parties in life who took an interest under the bequest, and in the event that Eufus had left two or more children living at his death it might have been more than fifty years before the absolute title would have vested in the one who survived all. The limitation,. therefore, is too remote, as this estate was entangled for more than one life, and of course it is not within the rule of' an executory devise.\u201d</p>\n<p id=\"b146-6\">In the case of \u2019Williamson vs. Daniel, 15 Wheaton, 568, says Chief Justice Marshall, in delivering the opinion <em>of the </em>Court, <em>\u201c There a/re no words im the will which restrain the dying without issue to the time of the death of the legatee.. </em>The remainder over is to take effect whenever either of the <em>immediate </em>legatees should die without a lawful heir of his or her body.\u201d Did the Euss will, which we are construing, rest entirely upon the 8th clause, there would be no doubt of the entailment; but, the 14th clause being annexed, we think there are <em>swpemdded </em>words which bring it within the rule of executory devise and entangles the estate \u25a0 only for the life of one in being.</p>\n<p id=\"b146-7\">The case of Bells vs. Gillespie, 5 Randolph, 275, is contradictory to the view we take of the word \u201csurvivor.\u201d In that case, there was a divided Court, Judge Coalter thinking the words \u201csurviving brothers,\u201d in that case, meant <em>at the tvme of his </em>death, and therefore the precise time for failure of issue was fixed, while Judges Cabell, Carr and <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"147\">*147</page-number>Green thought, by the use of those words, he looked to an indefinite failure of issue in the first taker' and too remote.</p>\n<p id=\"b147-5\">Snyder vs. Snyder, 2 Munford, 263, is a case relied upon by counsel for complainant. It will be seen, upon examination of that case, that the question of <em>intention of the testator </em>was not touched upon at \"all, but the case was decided upon the strict technical rules, - The words were not construed within any rule created for the purpose of supporting the <em>intention </em>of the testator, and so it will be found on examining most of the cases conflicting with the decisions in New York.</p>\n<p id=\"b147-6\">It is conceded that the construction of this will is a mere \u25a0question of intention.</p>\n<p id=\"b147-7\">Lord Macclesfield declared-that this technical rule of construing a dying without issue to import a definite failure of issue was created for the purpose of supporting the intention of the testator.\u20144 Kent, 285.</p>\n<p id=\"b147-8\"><em>We </em>have here, then, a precedent for construing \u201csurvivor\u201d as used in this clause of the will to import a definite failure of issue restricting the 8th clause for the purpose of \u25a0supporting the intention of the testator.</p>\n<p id=\"b147-9\">To return to the will of Russ. \"We have already seen it contains the essential quality to support an executory devise, if the expressions definitively limit the time when the contingency should happen, to wit: at the death of either of the children of testator. The question, then, is, are there expressions and circumstances of the will from which it can be collected that the words \u201cwithout heirs of the body,\u201d and \u201cheirs of the body,\u201d are used by the testator in a more confined sense.</p>\n<p id=\"b147-10\">First. It is evidenced by the will, that the legatees were to take in their character of <em>survwors.</em></p>\n<p id=\"b147-11\">Secondly. The words of the 14th clause, taken as a whole, confine the contingency on which the limitation rests to heirs then in being. The contingency was to take effect (if <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"148\">*148</page-number>ever) at the death of one of the legatees. If they had to wait for an indefinite failure of heirs, what was the use of providing for a division of the estate-? Again, as brother or sister, they might inherit under an indefinite failure of issue. If the testator intended that, why make provision for that which might, in due course of law, happen ?</p>\n<p id=\"b148-5\">Thirdly. The testator, in the 11th article of the will, makes provision for the com/plcmia/nt, she being the daughter of the deceased son. By this he sxfbstituted her for the deceased son, and makes provision that if she dies without children, then her property is to go to Joseph \"W., Mary E. and Margaret B. Buss, and secures it from her husband, if she has any, but makes no provision for what she might receive as heir of either Jos. \"W\"., Mary E. or Margaret B., which he would have done had he contemplated she might by any contingency inherit any portion of the property given either of them. Ilis grand-daughter was then in <em>esse. </em>He had reason to suppose she would survive her uncle and aunts.\"Were they or either of them to die, if he intended her to inherit, he would naturally have made provision for it in the eleventh item of the will. If he had intended to put his grand-daughter as \u201csurvivor\u201d on equal footing as the representative of her father with his other children, he would have included her by name in the 14th item of the will.</p>\n<p id=\"b148-6\">In Crugar vs. ex\u2019rs of Hayward, 2 Dess., 114, the Court say: \u201cAH'cases on the construction of wills depend on the particular penning of the wills themselves and the state of families to which they relate.\u201d</p>\n<p id=\"b148-7\">It is urged, that in some of the items of this will, where the bequest and devise is to Jos. W. Russ, Mary E. or Margaret B., it is to them their heirs and assigns, and it is asked, what becomes of the idea that this will contains an executory devise ? The answer is that the <em>latter </em>clause will prevail.\u2014Finly vs. King, 3 Peters, 366.</p>\n<p id=\"b148-8\">It is contended, on the authority of Barlow vs. Salter, 17 <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"149\">*149</page-number>Vesey, Jr., 479, tliat tlie word \u201csurvivor\u201d should be understood as meaning only <em>others. </em>It has undoubtedly been so construed, but it will be seen that Courts have construed it to fix the period of failure of issue. The construction of this, like other words, is governed by the expressions or circumstances contained in the will. It is insisted, that as the testator, by the use of the words \u201cheirs of her body,\u201d in the 8th item of the will, created an estate tail in the first taker, that therefore we cannot superadd the words in the 14th item to show that he did not mean those words in their legal sense. If this is so, what becomes of that fundamental rule in the construction of wills, to wit: <em>that the mient of the testator must govern the oonstrnctionf </em>It is by adding the last clause that we ascertain whether the testator meant the words \u201cheirs of the body\u201d in their legal sense, or whether he has used improper words, which he intended to use in another sense, i. e. <em>ehild/ren. </em>We think the testator evidently meant to say \u201cher children.\u201d The words \u201cheirs of the body\u201d have been construed children.\u20143 Atk., 781; 1 Ba. &amp; Ald., 713; 1 Bay, 85; 2 P. Wms., 342; 1 P. Wms., 229, 230; 20 Johnson, 483.</p>\n<p id=\"b149-6\">It is contended, that the case of Watts, adm\u2019r, vs. Clardy, 2 Florida, 369, settles the question in dispute in this cause. We do not intend any conflict with that case. That was a <em>deed </em>in which the word survivor is inserted, and the rule of construction of a deed is much more strict ;\u2022 besides, there are no such expressions or circumstance in the context of the deed or will in that case, and superadded words relating to the grantee, as there are in this case to the legatee. We are therefore satisfied that, according to the settled legal construction of terms, evinced by weight of authorities, the testator (Puss) intended in this will to provide for his surviving children on the contingency of either of them dying and leaving\u2019no issue at the death of the one so dying, and as this inten<page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"150\">*150</page-number>tion is consistent witli the rules of law, the limitation over is good by way of executory devise.</p>\n<p id=\"b150-5\">It is therefore ordered, adjudged and decreed, that the decree of the Chancellor in the Court below overruling said demurrer be reversed, and said bill be dismissed. But, under the circumstances of this case, the bill being for a construction of a will in which both parties were interested, it is further ordered, adjudged and decreed that the costs, including those in the Court below as well as in this Court, be paid by the administrator of the estate of Margaret B. Buss, deceased, out of the assets of said estate.</p>\n</opinion>\n</casebody>\n",
