The motions are fully briefed, and the Court heard oral argument on June 13, 2018. Doc. 191. For reasons that follow, the Court will deny the motion to amend, grant Defendants' motion for summary judgment on behalf of Governor Ducey, grant Plaintiffs' motion for summary judgment, and enter a permanent injunction.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-13\">\n   <strong>\n    I.

History of Defendants' Policy Changes.\n   </strong>\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-15\">\n   Arizona law allows noncitizens to obtain driver's licenses by presenting \"proof satisfactory to [Arizona Department of Transportation (\"ADOT\") ] that the applicant's presence in the United States is authorized under federal law.\" A.R.S. \u00a7 28-3153(D). ADOT Policy 16.1.4, which will be referred to in this Order as \"the Policy,\" explains how noncitizens can show authorized presence and obtain licenses. Before June 2012, the Policy provided that noncitizens could obtain driver's licenses by presenting any federally issued EAD, with any code.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-16\">\n   In June 2012, the Secretary of the Department of Homeland Security (\"DHS\") issued a memorandum announcing the Deferred Action for Childhood Arrivals (\"DACA\") program.\n   <em>\n    See\n   </em>\n   Memorandum from DHS Secretary Napolitano, Exercising Prosecutorial Discretion with Respect to Individuals Who Came to the United States as Children (June 15, 2012). Deferred action is a discretionary decision by DHS to defer removing an individual from the United States.\n   <em>\n    Id.\n   </em>\n   The DACA program granted deferred action to noncitizens brought to the United States as children, allowing them to remain in the country for renewable two-year periods if they satisfied certain conditions.\n   <em>\n    Id.\n   </em>\n   DACA recipients can apply to work in the United States.\n   <em>\n    Id.\n   </em>\n   If approved, they receive EADs coded \"(c)(33).\"\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-17\">\n   Arizona Governor Janice Brewer took exception to the DACA program. In August 2012, she issued Executive Order 2012-06 (the \"Executive Order\"), expressing Arizona's view that the \"issuance of Deferred Action or Deferred Action employment authorization documents to unlawfully present aliens does not confer upon them any lawful or authorized status and does not entitle them to any additional public benefit.\" Doc. 189 at 4-5. In other words, the Governor concluded that the DHS announcement did not mean that DACA recipients were authorized to be present in the United States under federal law. She directed Arizona agencies, including ADOT, to \"conduct a full statutory, rule-making and policy analysis and, to the extent not prohibited by state or federal law, initiate operational, policy, rule and statutory changes necessary to prevent Deferred Action recipients from obtaining eligibility, beyond those available to any\n   person regardless of lawful status, for any taxpayer-funded public benefits and state identification, including a driver's license[.]\"\n   <em>\n    Id.\n   </em>\n   at 4.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-18\">\n   In September 2012, ADOT changed the Policy. Doc. 125-3. Although ADOT previously had permitted all persons with federally issued EADs to obtain driver's licenses - apparently because it deemed the EADs to be sufficient proof of authorized presence in the United States - the new Policy announced that EADs issued to DACA recipients were not sufficient to prove authorized presence.\n   <em>\n    Id.\n   </em>\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-19\">\n   In November 2012, a group of DACA recipients and the Arizona Dream Act Coalition brought suit challenging the denial of driver's licenses.\n   <em>\n    Ariz. Dream Act Coal. v. Brewer\n   </em>\n   , Case No. 12-CV-02546-PHX-DGC. This Court granted ultimately summary judgment to the plaintiffs, finding that denying licenses to DACA recipients when all other EAD holders were allowed to obtain licenses violated the Equal Protection Clause.\n   <em>\n    Ariz.

Doc. 158-1 at 71-74.

Doc. 189 at 51. That test asks whether the individual (1) has formal immigration status, (2) is on a path to obtaining formal immigration status, or (3) has sought or been granted relief specifically authorized by the INA.\n   <em>\n    <extracted-citation index=\"9\" url=\"https://cite.case.law/citations/?q=8%20C.F.R.%20%C2%A7%20274\">\n     Id.\n    </extracted-citation>\n   </em>\n   <extracted-citation index=\"9\" url=\"https://cite.case.law/citations/?q=8%20C.F.R.%20%C2%A7%20274\">\n    at 46, 87\n   </extracted-citation>\n   .

But the Policy continued to deny\n   licenses to noncitizens with (c)(14) and (a)(11) EADs.\n   <em>\n    See\n   </em>\n   Doc. 158-1 at 76-79.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-25\">\n   In January 2015, Plaintiff Marcos Gonzalez presented his (c)(14) EAD at a Motor Vehicle Division (\"MVD\") location and was denied a license. Doc. 189 at 82, 167. He contacted his attorneys, and they sent a letter to Director Halikowski and Governor Ducey in April 2015.\n   <em>\n    <extracted-citation index=\"11\" url=\"https://cite.case.law/citations/?q=8%20C.F.R.%20%C2%A7%20274\">\n     Id.\n    </extracted-citation>\n   </em>\n   <extracted-citation index=\"11\" url=\"https://cite.case.law/citations/?q=8%20C.F.R.%20%C2%A7%20274\">\n    at 82-84, 168\n   </extracted-citation>\n   .

Director Halikowski responded that ADOT would issue Mr. Gonzalez a license because it appeared that he was a derivative beneficiary of a self-petitioner under the Violence Against Women Act (\"VAWA\").\n   <em>\n    <extracted-citation index=\"13\" url=\"https://cite.case.law/citations/?q=8%20C.F.R.%20%C2%A7%20274\">\n     Id.\n    </extracted-citation>\n   </em>\n   <extracted-citation index=\"13\" url=\"https://cite.case.law/citations/?q=8%20C.F.R.%20%C2%A7%20274\">\n    at 85\n   </extracted-citation>\n   . Mr. Gonzalez was issued a license in June 2015 (\n   <em>\n    id.\n   </em>\n   at 168), but no change was made to the Policy. When Mr. Gonzalez returned to the MVD to renew his license in February 2016, the license was denied.\n   <em>\n    <extracted-citation index=\"14\" url=\"https://cite.case.law/citations/?q=8%20C.F.R.%20%C2%A7%20274\">\n     Id.\n    </extracted-citation>\n   </em>\n   <extracted-citation index=\"14\" url=\"https://cite.case.law/citations/?q=8%20C.F.R.%20%C2%A7%20274\">\n    at 168\n   </extracted-citation>\n   .\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-26\">\n   Plaintiffs brought this lawsuit in September 2016, challenging the denial of licenses to noncitizens with EADs coded (c)(14) and (a)(11). Doc. 1. The following month, Defendants' counsel sent a letter to Plaintiffs' counsel explaining that each of the named plaintiffs was eligible for a license under Defendants' existing policy. Doc. 189 at 86-89. The letter stated that VAWA derivative beneficiaries (like Mr. Gonzalez) were eligible because \"immigration relief as a VAWA derivative is expressly provided for under the INA[,]\" and U-visa applicants awaiting the availability of a visa (like the remaining named plaintiffs) were eligible because they are \"on a path to obtaining a formal immigration status\" and they seek relief \"expressly provided for under the INA.\"\n   <em>\n    <extracted-citation index=\"15\" url=\"https://cite.case.law/citations/?q=8%20C.F.R.%20%C2%A7%20274\">\n     Id.\n    </extracted-citation>\n   </em>\n   <extracted-citation index=\"15\" url=\"https://cite.case.law/citations/?q=8%20C.F.R.%20%C2%A7%20274\">\n    at 87-88\n   </extracted-citation>\n   . No update was made to the Policy at that time.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-27\">\n   On January 20, 2017, the Court held a hearing in this case on Plaintiffs' motion for a preliminary injunction. Doc. 55. Counsel for Defendants asserted that each of the Plaintiffs could obtain driver's licenses by presenting additional documentation. But when the Court asked defense counsel where this ADOT policy could be found - where it had been made public in any form - counsel was unable to identify a public statement of the policy.\n   <em>\n    See\n   </em>\n   Doc. 59 at 11-12. A few weeks later, in February 2017, ADOT changed the Policy to provide that certain categories of (c)(14) EAD holders - categories that correspond precisely to the Plaintiffs in this case - could obtain licenses by presenting additional documents.\n   <em>\n    See\n   </em>\n   Doc. 187 \u00b6 21; Doc. 158-1 at 86-89. The Policy continued to state that holders of (a)(11) EADs cannot receive licenses.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-28\">\n   Given this history, the Court concludes that ADOT's policy changes have been made either because of Governor Brewer's disagreement with the federal government's DACA program or in an effort to defend the resulting policy in court. As noted, ADOT long accepted deferred action EADs as sufficient proof of authorized presence in the United States for purposes of A.R.S. \u00a7 28-3153(D). ADOT changed this policy and denied licenses only to DACA recipients after Governor Brewer issued her Executive Order. Once this Court noted in the\n   <em>\n    Dream Act\n   </em>\n   case that equal protection problems arise from denying licenses to some deferred action recipients while granting them to others, ADOT changed its policy to add (c)(14) and (a)(11) EADs to the ban that already applied to DACA recipients. This change allowed ADOT to argue, as it later did, that DACA recipients were not the only deferred action recipients who were denied licenses.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-29\">\n   ADOT changed its policy with respect to DACA recipients when ordered to do so in the\n   <em>\n    Dream Act\n   </em>\n   case, but left in place the ban on (c)(14) and (a)(11) recipients - that is, until this lawsuit was filed. When Plaintiffs\n   brought this case, ADOT argued that they had no injury because they could obtain licenses by presenting additional documents. This assertion, however, was not supported by any change to the Policy. Only after this Court questioned defense counsel on where the alleged policy could be found did ADOT formally amend the Policy. Again, it appears that ADOT changed its policy to bolster its defense in court.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-30\">\n   ADOT disputes that the 2017 change was a change at all, instead characterizing it as a \"clarification\" of already existing policies.\n   <em>\n    See\n   </em>\n   Doc. 125-13 at 17; Doc. 187 \u00b6\u00b6 21-22. But Defendants had no written policy regarding the availability of licenses to (c)(14) holders until the 2017 changes, and Director Halikowski testified that he did not know whether\n   <em>\n    any\n   </em>\n   ADOT employee other than himself was aware that (c)(14) holders might be eligible before those changes. Doc. 189 at 70-71. Indeed, Defendants can identify no person holding a (c)(14) EAD who was granted a license between September 2013 and February 2017 other than Mr. Gonzalez, who received a license only after his lawyer contacted the agency. What is more, ADOT's Rule 30(b)(6) witness, Madelene Carbajal, testified that persons holding (c)(14) EADs between the 2013 and 2017 Policy changes would have been turned away at the MVD's greeter station, and that the issuance of Mr. Gonzalez's license in 2015 violated the Policy. Doc. 176-2 at 19-22, 25-27, 34;\n   <em>\n    see also\n   </em>\n   Doc. 184 at 4 n.4.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-31\">\n   <strong>\n    B. Additional Background.\n   </strong>\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-32\">\n   The February 2017 version of the Policy states that holders of (c)(14) EADs \"may be eligible\" if they are a derivative of a self-petitioner under VAWA or have a pending application for a visa or change of immigration status. Doc. 158-1 at 94. It further states:\n  </p>\n  <blockquote id=\"p-33\">\n   Documents sufficient to establish authorized presence may include:\n  </blockquote>\n  <blockquote id=\"p-34\">\n   1. Form I-797 Notice of Action that identifies the EAC holder as a derivative child named in a Form I-360, Petition for Amerasian, Widow(er) or Special Immigrant.\n  </blockquote>\n  <blockquote id=\"p-35\">\n   2. Form I-918 Petition for U Nonimmigrant Status (U Visa) that has been received by [the U.S. Citizenship and Immigration Services (\"USCIS\") ].\n  </blockquote>\n  <p id=\"p-36\">\n   Doc. 158-1 at 89. In July 2017, ADOT amended the Policy to add that \"[a]n original form I-797 may be accepted when the receipt and/or case number is redacted.\" Doc. 158-1 at 94 (emphasis omitted). The February and July 2017 versions are otherwise identical.\n   <em>\n    See\n   </em>\n   Doc. 158-1 at 86-89, 91-94.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-37\">\n   The named plaintiffs are noncitizen residents of Arizona who have deferred action designations and have been issued (c)(14) EADs from USCIS, which authorize them to remain and work in the United States. Of the six named plaintiffs, one is a VAWA derivative beneficiary, three have pending U-visa applications, and two have been granted U visas. Three named plaintiffs - Marcos Gonzalez, Maria Aceituno Lopez, and Araceli Franco Gonzalez - continue to hold (c)(14) EADs and have attempted to obtain licenses using their (c)(14) EADs (and, in some instances, additional documents) at an MVD location.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-38\">\n   Plaintiffs represent a class of all (c)(14) EAD holders. When the Court certified the class, it declined to include (a)(11) holders because no named plaintiffs held an (a)(11) EAD. Doc. 153. Plaintiffs challenge ADOT and MVD policies and practices which require them to present documentation in addition to their EADs to prove authorized presence. Plaintiffs assert that the policies violate the Equal Protection and Supremacy Clauses of the U.S. Constitution. Doc. 93 \u00b6\u00b6 61-85. Plaintiffs seek declaratory and injunctive relief\n   prohibiting Defendants from enforcing the challenged policies.\n   <em>\n    <extracted-citation index=\"16\" url=\"https://cite.case.law/citations/?q=8%20C.F.R.%20%C2%A7%20274\">\n     Id.\n    </extracted-citation>\n   </em>\n   <extracted-citation index=\"16\" url=\"https://cite.case.law/citations/?q=8%20C.F.R.%20%C2%A7%20274\">\n    \u00b6\u00b6 85\n   </extracted-citation>\n   (A)-(E).\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-39\">\n   Defendants argue that the Court should narrow the class definition to exclude certain (c)(14) EAD holders who suffer a different injury from Plaintiffs. Doc. 155. Defendants also argue that they are entitled to summary judgment because the claims against the Governor are barred by sovereign immunity, and the claims against the remaining defendants fail on the merits. Doc. 157. Plaintiffs assert that they are entitled to summary judgment, a permanent injunction, and declaratory relief. Doc. 165.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-40\">\n   <strong>\n    II. Motion to Amend the Class Definition.\n   </strong>\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-41\">\n   Defendants seek to narrow the class definition to (c)(14) EAD holders who are VAWA derivative beneficiaries and U-visa applicants. Defendants argue that including all (c)(14) EAD holders in the class is improper because they are not all treated alike. The named plaintiffs may obtain licenses by providing additional documents, but, Defendants assert, other (c)(14) EAD holders cannot obtain licenses. Doc. 155. Defendants argue that the named plaintiffs cannot represent these other (c)(14) holders because they suffer a distinct injury.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-42\">\n   Defendants ask the Court to modify the class definition by adding the following italicized language:\n  </p>\n  <blockquote id=\"p-43\">\n   All noncitizens holding [EADs] coded (c)(14)\n   <em>\n    by receiving relief under either the Violence Against Women Act (VAWA) or Unonimmigrant visa (U-visa) programs\n   </em>\n   who are being denied or will be denied the ability to present their EADs alone as sufficient proof of federally authorized presence in order to obtain an Arizona driver's license, as a result of Defendants' 2013 and 2017 policies and related practices pursuant to Executive Order 2012-06, Arizona Department of Transportation (ADOT) Policy 16.1.4, and ADOT Policy 16.1.4's implementation.\n  </blockquote>\n  <p id=\"p-44\">\n   Doc. 155 at 2 (emphasis added).\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-45\">\n   The distinction drawn by Defendants among (c)(14) holders appears designed solely for litigation purposes - to defeat the named plaintiffs' claims for want of injury, or to narrow the class as much as possible. Defendants assert that (c)(14) EADs are granted to two broad categories: individuals who are eligible for deferred action pursuant to specific statutory programs establishing eligibility criteria, and individuals who are granted deferred action on a case-by-case basis pursuant to USCIS's sole discretion.

In support, Defendants compare regular deferred action recipients to recipients of deferred enforced departure, who receive EADs coded (a)(11). The Court has two problems with this comparison. First, the Court denied class certification for (a)(11) EAD holders in part because there was no plaintiff in this case with such an EAD. The circumstances for (c)(14) EAD holders are different - each Plaintiff possesses a (c)(14) EAD, and Defendants' policy singles out all (c)(14) EAD holders for some form of different treatment. Second, the distinction among (c)(14) EAD holders is one entirely of Defendants' creation, after this lawsuit was filed. Defendants provide no policy rationale for the distinction. They make no attempt to argue that the presence of (c)(14) EAD holders outside the VAWA and U-visa programs is somehow less \"authorized under federal law\" for purposes of A.R.S. \u00a7 28-3153(D). Defendants' new distinction appears to have been created solely in an effort to moot Plaintiffs' claims or narrow the class in this litigation. The Court cannot conclude that changes based on such litigation tactics provide a legitimate ground for subdividing the class. Accepting such maneuvering would permit Defendants to defeat the purposes of Rule 23.\n   <em>\n    See, e.g.\n   </em>\n   ,\n   <em>\n    Deposit Guar. Nat'l Bank, Jackson, Miss. v.

Doc. 157 at 3-6. Plaintiffs assert that the Executive Order issued by Governor Ducey's predecessor, which is still in effect, provides a direct link. Doc. 165-1 at 36-39. The Court is not persuaded.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-62\">\n   Because the Executive Order declares that a deferred action designation does not confer authorized presence on the recipient, the 2013 Policy, which denied (c)(14) EAD holders licenses altogether, could be viewed as a logical result of the Executive Order. But the two most recent updates do not deny licenses to (c)(14) EAD holders - they permit licenses on presentation of additional documents. The 2017 Policy changes clearly were not caused by the Executive Order's directive to \"initiate operational, policy, rule and statutory changes necessary to prevent Deferred Action recipients from obtaining ... a driver's license.\" Plaintiffs point to no other language in the Executive Order that could be interpreted to mandate ADOT's current policy.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-63\">\n   Nor do Plaintiffs submit evidence that Director Halikowski and ADOT were in fact responding to the Executive Order when they issued the 2013 Policy changes. Plaintiffs cite notes from an August 2012 ADOT meeting discussing what action to take in response to DACA and the Executive Order.\n   <em>\n    See\n   </em>\n   Doc. 189 at 42-43. The\n   notes make clear that ADOT believed a policy of denying licenses to DACA recipients would strictly adhere to the Executive Order, but there is no suggestion that ADOT believed the Executive Order required it to deny licenses to (c)(14) EAD holders. Moreover, according to testimony from a representative of former Governor Brewer in the\n   <em>\n    Dream Act\n   </em>\n   case, the Executive Order was aimed solely at DACA recipients.\n   <em>\n    See\n   </em>\n   Doc. 189 at 231, 234, 246, 255.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-64\">\n   Director Halikowski testified that in making the 2013 changes to the Policy, ADOT relied on the three-part test discussed above.

Defendants purport to grant driver's licenses only to (c)(14) EAD holders who are VAWA derivative beneficiaries or have pending U-visa applications, and who present documents verifying this status. As the Ninth Circuit noted above, however, the federal government makes no such distinction. It recognizes all (c)(14) deferred action recipients - and other noncitizens who lack formal immigration status, such as (c)(9) and (c)(10) EAD holders - as authorized \"to live and work in the country for an undefined period of time, provided they comply with certain conditions.\"\n   <em>\n    Id.\n   </em>\n   at 973.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-79\">\n   Importantly, Defendants' most recent (c)(14) policy purports to be based on the same three-part test as the former (c)(33) policy - the test the Ninth Circuit held \"cannot be equated with 'authorized presence' under federal law.\"\n   <em>\n    Id.\n   </em>\n   Defendants point to no fact that would make the three-part test more appropriate when applied to (c)(14) EAD holders than to (c)(33) EAD holders. Thus, as in the\n   <em>\n    Dream Act\n   </em>\n   case, Defendants' policy \"necessarily embodies the State's independent judgment that [certain recipients of deferred action] are not 'authorized' to be present in the United States 'under federal law.' \"\n   <em>\n    Id.\n   </em>\n   at 973.

Doc. 165-1 at 20. The Court agrees. Even if a driver's license falls within the definition of a \"State public benefit,\" there is no evidence suggesting that Defendants utilized the statute's definitions of \"qualified alien\" and \"nonimmigrant\" to guide their (c)(14) policies, other than the general citation to \"U.S.C. 8\" contained in Policy 16.1.4. Defendants grant licenses to persons who can prove \"authorized presence,\" not persons who can prove they are \"nonimmigrants\" or \"qualified aliens.\" ADOT's three-part test for determining \"authorized presence\" does not appear to have any link to \u00a7 1621 or these definitions, and Defendants' policies do not require other noncitizens or EAD holders to demonstrate that they are qualified aliens or nonimmigrants within the meaning of the statute.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-82\">\n   Moreover, the Ninth Circuit considered and rejected Defendants' argument that \u00a7 1622 suggests Congress did not intend to preclude all state regulation of immigration in the\n   <em>\n    Dream Act\n   </em>\n   case, explaining:\n  </p>\n  <blockquote id=\"p-83\">\n   we do not conclude that Congress has preempted all state regulations that touch upon immigration.

In other words, the problem with Defendants' classification scheme is not simply that it refers to immigration classifications, but that it creates classifications with no basis in the federal scheme.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-85\">\n   Defendants also characterize Plaintiffs' preemption claim as attacking mere documentary burdens on (c)(14) holders, and argue that these documentary requirements are not classifications. Doc. 157 at 9. But the policy Plaintiffs attack is the three-part test and Defendants' implementation of that test (through ADOT's Policy and MVD policies and practices) with respect to (c)(14) EAD holders. Director Halikowski testified that the (c)(14) policy is based on the three-part test, and that certain EAD holders - although permitted to remain in the country by the federal government - do not \"meet the definition that [he] set up for authorized presence under federal law.\" Doc. 189 at 48-49. Thus, Defendants' (c)(14) policies are based on the very test the Ninth Circuit found preempted in the\n   <em>\n    Dream Act\n   </em>\n   case.\n   <em>\n    See, e.g.\n   </em>\n   , Doc. 189 at 46, 87, 219-20, 222.
