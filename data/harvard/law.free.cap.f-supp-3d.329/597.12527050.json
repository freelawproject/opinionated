Plaintiffs have sued the United States Department of State; Rex Tillerson, in his official capacity as Secretary of State; the Bureau of Population, Refugees, and Migration (\"PRM\"); Simon Henshaw, in his official capacity as Acting Assistant Secretary of State for the PRM; United States Department of Health and Human Services (\"HHS\"); Thomas E. Price, in his official capacity as Secretary of HHS; the Office of Refugee Resettlement (\"ORR\"); and Ken Tota, in his official capacity as Acting Director of ORR (collectively the \"Federal Government\"). Plaintiffs seek a declaration that the challenged laws exceed Congress's authority under the United States Constitution's Spending Clause and violate the Tenth Amendment to the Constitution. They also seek injunctive relief prohibiting further refugee resettlements in Tennessee until the Federal Government absorbs all costs of those resettlements.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-11\">\n   Defendants have filed a motion to dismiss for lack of subject-matter jurisdiction or, in the alternative, for failure to state a claim upon which relief can be granted.

In this way, \"[t]he law of Article III standing ... serves to prevent the judicial process from being used to usurp the powers of the political branches,\" and confines the federal courts to a properly judicial role.\n  </blockquote>\n  <blockquote id=\"p-49\">\n   Our cases have established that the \"irreducible constitutional minimum\" of standing consists of three elements. The plaintiff must have (1) suffered an injury in fact, (2) that is fairly traceable to the challenged conduct of the defendant, and (3) that is likely to be redressed by a favorable judicial decision. The plaintiff, as the party invoking federal jurisdiction, bears the burden of establishing these elements. [When], as here, a case is at the pleading stage, the plaintiff must \"clearly ... allege facts demonstrating\" each element.\n  </blockquote>\n  <p id=\"p-50\">\n   <em>\n    Spokeo,\n   </em>\n   <extracted-citation case-ids=\"12596653\" index=\"92\" url=\"https://cite.case.law/s-ct/136/1540/\">\n    136 S.Ct. at\n   </extracted-citation>\n   1547 ;\n   <em>\n    see also\n   </em>\n   <em>\n    United States v.

Although Plaintiffs are correct that the General Assembly has standing to protect itself from injury to its legislative authority under\n   <em>\n    Arizona State Legislature\n   </em>\n   , a legislature must establish that it has suffered a concrete and particularized injury, i.e., a complete loss of legislative power, in order to meet the requirements of Article III.

Richardson\n   </em>\n   announced the states' obligation to extend Medicaid coverage to lawfully present aliens in 1971; the Secretary codified that obligation by regulation in 1973; and Congress ratified the Secretary's decision when it passed the Omnibus Budget Reconciliation Act of 1986, ten years before the Welfare Reform Act. For decades Tennessee has accepted federal Medicaid funds based on the understanding that it must cover lawfully present aliens under its Medicaid program. The refugee coverage provision narrowed rather than expanded that requirement by placing a time limit on the states' obligation to expend state funds on health-care services for refugees.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-120\">\n   Plaintiffs contend that, despite its longevity, changed conditions and modifications to the Refugee Resettlement Program have transformed it into a new program that Tennessee could not have foreseen. According to Plaintiffs, Tennessee's participation in the Medicaid program predates the advent of the refugee resettlement program in 1980 as well as the elimination of federal funding for the program in 1991. They argue that changes in the refugee resettlement program have resulted in a radically different program than originally intended. Plaintiffs claim to have been surprised\n   by the fact that the Federal Government did not honor Tennessee's decision to withdraw from the program in 2007 but instead continued it by using federal contractors while increasing the overall number of refugees. They characterize these changes as ones Tennessee could not have anticipated and that caused a \"shift in kind, not merely degree\" as was found to be unconstitutional in\n   <em>\n    NFIB\n   </em>\n   <em>\n    .\n   </em>\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-121\">\n   Despite Plaintiffs' arguments, this Court finds that the requirement of providing state funding for refugees in exchange for federal Medicaid funds cannot be considered \"new\" as was the ACA expansion provision in\n   <em>\n    NFIB\n   </em>\n   . In\n   <em>\n    NFIB\n   </em>\n   , \"the condition at issue was 'new' in two senses of the word: [the condition] had been recently enacted at the time of the litigation, and [the condition] imposed additional requirements with which States had to comply to continue receiving preexisting federal funding.\"\n   <em>\n    Miss. Comm'n on Envtl. Quality v. E.P.A.\n   </em>\n   ,\n   <extracted-citation case-ids=\"4279739,4273053\" index=\"397\" url=\"https://cite.case.law/f3d/790/138/\">\n    790 F.3d 138\n   </extracted-citation>\n   , 179 (D.C. Cir. 2015). As explained above, the requirement to provide Medicaid to refugees is long standing rather than being recently enacted at the time of this litigation. Additionally, no additional requirements have been imposed on Tennessee in order for it to receive preexisting federal funding.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-122\">\n   Moreover, there is no federal requirement that a state participate in the refugee program in order for that state to be required to provide benefits to refugees. The Federal Government's practice of relying on private non-profit organizations to administer refugee resettlement in states that elect to discontinue participation in the refugee program under \"Wilson/Fish\" programs was established by at least 1999.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-123\">\n   Plaintiffs cannot now claim to be surprised by the cessation of reimbursement for the cost of providing Medicaid coverage to refugees since Congress ceased to appropriate funds for that purpose in 1991, a fact acknowledged in the complaint.\n   <footnotemark>\n    15\n   </footnotemark>\n   Despite the lack of reimbursement, the State has continued to participate in the Medicaid program.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-124\">\n   Finally, Plaintiffs maintain that the growing number of refugees admitted in recent years has increased the cost of refugee health-care to the states and was not anticipated at the time Tennessee entered into the program. To the contrary, as pointed out by Defendants, periodic international humanitarian crises accompanied by refugees seeking to resettle in the United States has always been foreseeable. Under the Refugee Act of 1980, \"the number of refugees who may be admitted\" each year is not fixed or determined according to a prescribed formula, but \"shall be such number as the President determines, before the beginning of the fiscal year ... is justified by humanitarian concerns or is otherwise in the national interest.\"\n   <extracted-citation index=\"398\" url=\"https://cite.case.law/citations/?q=8%20U.S.C.%20%C2%A7%201157\">\n    8 U.S.C. \u00a7 1157\n   </extracted-citation>\n   (a)(2). The President may also admit additional numbers of refugees as needed to meet \"unforeseen emergency refugee situation[s].\"\n   <em>\n    <extracted-citation index=\"399\" url=\"https://cite.case.law/citations/?q=8%20U.S.C.%20%C2%A7%201157\">\n     Id.\n    </extracted-citation>\n   </em>\n   \u00a7 1157(b). Given the history of recurrent refugee crises and the purpose of the Refugee Act, variation in the numbers of annual refugee admissions are to be expected.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-125\">\n   None of the events described by Plaintiffs represents a departure from the understanding pursuant to which Tennessee has accepted Federal Medicaid funds for over forty years-that it must cover lawfully present aliens, including refugees, under its Medicaid program. Therefore, Plaintiffs have not shown that the requirement that Tennessee provide Medicaid\n   coverage for refugees for seven years is a new program within the ambit of\n   <em>\n    NFIB\n   </em>\n   <em>\n    .\n   </em>\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-126\">\n   Plaintiffs also contend that the amount of federal Medicaid funds Tennessee might lose if they do not comply with the requirement to provide Medicaid to refugees is so large that they have no choice but to continue with the program. The\n   <em>\n    NFIB\n   </em>\n   Court looked at the amount of funding at stake for the states in deciding that the expanded Medicaid program under the ACA was unconstitutionally coercive. Chief Justice Roberts noted that \"the financial 'inducement' Congress has chosen is much more than 'relatively mild encouragement'-it is a gun to the head,\"\n   <em>\n    NFIB\n   </em>\n   , 567 U.S. at 581,\n   <extracted-citation case-ids=\"12407356\" index=\"400\" url=\"https://cite.case.law/us/567/519/#p576\">\n    132 S.Ct. 2566\n   </extracted-citation>\n   ; however, the Court did not specify a point at which financial inducement becomes coercion. Instead, the Court commented that\n   <em>\n    Steward Machine Co.\n   </em>\n   did not attempt to fix a line at which persuasion gives way to coercion, and the\n   <em>\n    NFIB\n   </em>\n   Court declined to do so as well. \"It is enough for today that wherever that line may be, this statute is surely beyond it.\"\n   <em>\n    <extracted-citation case-ids=\"12407356\" index=\"401\" url=\"https://cite.case.law/us/567/519/#p576\">\n     Id.\n    </extracted-citation>\n   </em>\n   <extracted-citation case-ids=\"12407356\" index=\"401\" url=\"https://cite.case.law/us/567/519/#p576\">\n    at 585\n   </extracted-citation>\n   ,\n   <extracted-citation case-ids=\"12407356\" index=\"402\" url=\"https://cite.case.law/us/567/519/#p576\">\n    132 S.Ct. 2566\n   </extracted-citation>\n   .\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-127\">\n   While Tennessee could potentially lose all of its federal Medicaid funds, the Federal Government could withhold only part of the State's federal Medicaid funding.\n   <footnotemark>\n    16\n   </footnotemark>\n   At this juncture, this Court cannot ascertain what amount the State is faced with losing. Although inherent in Medicaid's provisions for the process of amending a state's Medicaid plan is the possibility that the Federal Government might deny a proposed amendment and withhold all or part of the funding, there is no allegation the Federal Government has made such a threat to Tennessee. This case does not present the situation in\n   <em>\n    NFIB\n   </em>\n   in which, in exchange for new conditions to a federal program, Congress not only offered states additional money but also threatened to stop providing the funding it currently distributed for that program if those conditions were not accepted.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-128\">\n   Moreover, the amount of the loss of funding is only one element of the coercion test adopted by the\n   <em>\n    NFIB\n   </em>\n   plurality.

Chief Justice John Roberts, in a plurality opinion joined by Justice Stephen Breyer and Justice Elena Kagan, offered one rationale for that holding. A joint dissent by Justice Antonin Scalia, Justice Anthony Kennedy, Justice Clarence Thomas, and Justice Samuel Alito offered another.\n   </p>\n  </footnote>\n  <footnote label=\"13\">\n   <p id=\"p-145\">\n    The Court's decision on the other portions of the ACA that were challenged in\n    <em>\n     NFIB\n    </em>\n    is not pertinent to this case.\n   </p>\n  </footnote>\n  <footnote label=\"14\">\n   <p id=\"p-146\">\n    The plurality found a Spending Clause violation because it determined that the Medicaid program expansion was a new program, participation in which was a condition for continued receipt of pre-ACA Medicaid funds and because the loss of pre-ACA Medicaid funds would have been so consequential to the states that states had no real option to refuse. Thus, the expansion placed a condition on the receipt of funds that did not govern the use of those funds, and the condition was unduly coercive. While the joint dissent would have held the expansion provision unconstitutional based on the plurality's analysis, they took the coercion analysis a step further and would have invalidated the expansion based on a finding of coercion alone. Because the plurality's rationale was narrower, it is considered to be the holding of the Court.\n    <em>\n     See\n    </em>\n    <em>\n     Marks v.
