It is certainly plausible that Defendants stand to profit from Plaintiff utilizing its services, even if at no cost Plaintiff.

Defendants also argue that Plaintiff's Complaint failed to provide sufficient facts to support its conclusory assertion that the Fax was an advertisement. ECF No. 27 at 8. But Plaintiff attached the actual fax to the Complaint, and the Court is hard-pressed to think of what additional factual allegations would more clearly suggest that Defendants have offered Plaintiff a commercially-available service through the use of a fax machine in order to defeat a 12(b)(6) motion.

While the Fourth Circuit's ruling in\n   <em>\n    Carlton &amp; Harris\n   </em>\n   makes clear that the Court is bound by the FCC's interpretation of the TCPA, the Court certainly has jurisdiction to review the facts of the instant case, apply the FCC's interpretation (as further clarified by the Fourth Circuit), and determine whether the Fax is an \"advertisement.\" In considering the first two factors above, the Court would hesitate to stay the instant proceedings because the Court is capable of applying FCC and Fourth Circuit guidance to make such a determination without needing to rely on the agency's technical expertise.

Following\n   <em>\n    Campbell-Ewald\n   </em>\n   , the Fourth Circuit has not addressed whether plaintiffs may file such \"Placeholder\" motions to prevent defendants from mooting class action complaints through conduct not explicitly barred by\n   <em>\n    Campbell-Ewald\n   </em>\n   <em>\n    .

July 12, 2016) (\"[T]he Fourth Circuit has not addressed ... whether a defendant can moot a putative Rule 23 class action by picking off a named plaintiff's individual claim with a judgment offer for which funds have been tendered, or with a judgment offer that a named plaintiff accepts.\"). Nor has the Fourth Circuit suggested that such motions are necessary.\n   <em>\n    See\n    <extracted-citation index=\"76\" url=\"https://cite.case.law/citations/?q=2016%20WL%203679345\">\n     id.\n    </extracted-citation>\n   </em>\n   (noting that the court could not find any Fourth Circuit precedent to justify plaintiff counsel's concerns that without a pending placeholder motion, the named plaintiff's acceptance of an offer would necessarily moot the class action).

CONCLUSION\n   </strong>\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-52\">\n   For the foregoing reasons, Defendants' Motion to Dismiss, ECF No. 22, shall be granted in part and denied in part, and the case is stayed pending review by the FCC.

However, the TCPA itself is not expressly limited to individual consumers, and such a finding would be inapposite with cases discussed herein that held that corporate plaintiffs had standing to pursue TCPA claims.\n    <em>\n     See\n    </em>\n    <extracted-citation index=\"77\" url=\"https://cite.case.law/citations/?q=47%20U.S.C.%20%C2%A7%20227\">\n     47 U.S.C. \u00a7 227\n    </extracted-citation>\n    (b)(3) (noting that a \"person\n    <em>\n     or entity\n    </em>\n    \" may bring a private right of action for TCPA violations) (emphasis added).\n   </p>\n  </footnote>\n  <footnote label=\"5\">\n   <p id=\"p-59\">\n    Pin cites to documents filed on the Court's electronic filing system (CM/ECF) refer to the page numbers generated by that system.\n   </p>\n  </footnote>\n  <footnote label=\"6\">\n   <p id=\"p-60\">\n    Notably, as Plaintiff points out,\n    <em>\n     Van Patten\n    </em>\n    appears to overrule the California district court cases cited by Defendants that held that statutory TCPA violations were insufficient to establish a concrete injury.\n    <em>\n     See\n    </em>\n    ECF No. 23 at 10-11.\n   </p>\n  </footnote>\n  <footnote label=\"7\">\n   <p id=\"p-61\">\n    Defendants' argument is based on the misguided assumption that Plaintiff only alleges that Defendants violated the TCPA by failing to include an opt-out notice in the fax.\n    <em>\n     See\n    </em>\n    ECF No. 27 at 2 (\"None of these injuries relate to the violation Plaintiff actually alleges Inovalon committed, which is that the fax in question did not contain the 'opt-out notice' required to assert defenses under the Act.\") (internal quotation marks omitted). Plaintiff's Complaint clearly alleges that Defendants sent an unsolicited fax\n    <em>\n     and\n    </em>\n    sent a fax without the required opt-out notice.
