Big Picture Loans, LLC (\"Big Picture\") and Ascension Technologies, Inc. (\"Ascension\") argue that the Court lacks subject matter jurisdiction over all claims asserted against them because they qualify as arms of the Lac Vieux Desert Band of Lake Superior Chippewa Indians (\"the Tribe\") and are thereby entitled to tribal sovereign immunity. For the reasons set forth below, the motion was denied.\n   <em>\n    See\n   </em>\n   ECF No. 124.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-12\">\n   <strong>\n    BACKGROUND\n   </strong>\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-13\">\n   <strong>\n    A. Factual Background\n   </strong>\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-14\">\n   <strong>\n    1. Tribal Regulatory Structure\n   </strong>\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-15\">\n   The Tribe is a federally recognized Indian tribe, and its members reside close to their ancestral homeland near Watersmeet, Michigan. 25 U.S.C. \u00a7 1300h(1)-(2). Its status as an \"independent tribal entity\" has consistently been reaffirmed.\n   <em>\n    See\n   </em>\n   <em>\n    id.\n   </em>\n   \u00a7 1300h-2(a). As a result, the Tribe is a sovereign entity that can create its own laws and regulations.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-16\">\n   To that end, the Tribe adopted its current constitution on May 14, 1992 (\"the LVD Constitution\") for the Tribe's \"government, protection and common welfare.\" ECF No. 23-1 at 1, 19. Among other things, the LVD Constitution established the Tribe's council (\"the LVD Council\"), granting it the authority to,\n   <em>\n    inter alia\n   </em>\n   , enact law, including ordinances and regulations; manage the Tribe's economic affairs; and \"promote and protect the health, safety, education, and general welfare of the [Tribe] and its members.\"\n   <em>\n    Id.\n   </em>\n   art. IV, \u00a7 1(a)-(b), (f). The Council could also charter organizations and delegate them with the authority to manage the Tribe's economic affairs.\n   <em>\n    Id.\n   </em>\n   \u00a7 1(j).\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-17\">\n   The Tribe initially pursued economic self-sufficiency by opening a casino in the late 1990s. The casino provided significant revenue for the Tribe until 2008, when the recession severely limited the casino's revenue stream and forced the Tribe to explore other avenues to improve its finances. One of these steps was to start tribal businesses in certain areas, such as online lending, that would yield profits for the Tribe. Hazen Aff. (ECF No. 34-1) \u00b6\u00b6 2-5.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-18\">\n   On July 8, 2011, the LVD Council enacted the Tribal Consumer Financial Services Regulatory Code (\"the Code\"), which legalized online lending by the Tribe. July 8, 2011 Resolution (ECF No. 23-5) at 1; Nov. 18, 2011 Resolution (ECF No. 23-3) at 1-2. The purpose of the Code was,\n   <em>\n    inter alia\n   </em>\n   : (1) to \"[d]iversify and expedite the development of the [Tribe's] economy\" in order to \"improve the Tribe's economic self-sufficiency [and] to enable the Tribe to better serve the social, economic, educational, and health and safety needs of its members and visitors\"; (2) to \"[e]nsure that all consumer financial services profits are used for the benefit of the Tribe and [it]s community\"; and (3) to \"[e]nsure that the Tribe provides a Tribal-based forum for the fair and orderly resolution of consumer financial services disputes consistent with the Tribe's preservation of sovereign immunity.\" Code (ECF No. 23-4) \u00a7\u00a7 1.1(a), 1.2(a), (c), (g). The Code required that all entities offering tribal consumer financial services obtain licenses through a particular licensing process, as part of which licensees had to certify that they would \"abide by all applicable Tribal and Federal laws, regulations and policies.\"\n   <em>\n    Id.\n   </em>\n   \u00a7\u00a7 1.3(d), 5-7, 5.2(b)(8). It also established specific rules for certain financial services\n   transactions, including small loans transactions.\n   <em>\n    See\n   </em>\n   <em>\n    id.\n   </em>\n   \u00a7 11.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-19\">\n   The Code also created the Tribal Financial Services Regulatory Authority (\"the TFSRA\") to enforce the Code and regulate licensees.\n   <em>\n    Id.\n   </em>\n   \u00a7 4.1. As a governmental subdivision of the Tribe, the TFSRA was \"under the direction and control of the [LVD] Council.\"\n   <em>\n    Id.\n   </em>\n   \u00a7 4.4. However, the Code granted the TFSRA certain independent powers, including, as relevant here, the powers: (1) to \"promulgate, adopt, and enforce regulations and rules furthering the purpose and provisions of the th[e] Code\"; (2) to discipline licensees and other persons \"by ordering immediate compliance, issuing fines and sanctions, and suspending or revoking any [l]icense pursuant to the hearings and due process required by Section 4.18 of th[e] Code\"; and (3) to investigate any licensee or person engaging in consumer financial services within the Tribe's jurisdiction.\n   <em>\n    Id.\n   </em>\n   \u00a7 4.13(a)-(d), (h)-(i);\n   <em>\n    id.\n   </em>\n   \u00a7\u00a7 4.14, 4.16, 4.18.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-20\">\n   In addition, the Code placed the TFSRA at the center of a three-tiered dispute resolution process for loan borrowers from tribal licensees. First, consumers that are \"aggrieved\" by a licensee's action must submit a written complaint to the licensee. The licensee must respond in writing within thirty days, and if it does not, it may be fined by the TFSRA in an amount equivalent to the greater of the outstanding principal loan amount or $1,500.\n   <em>\n    Id.\n   </em>\n   \u00a7 9.2(a)-(b). Second, consumers dissatisfied with a licensee's response (or who receive no response at all) may submit a written request for administrative review to the TFSRA within ninety days of the licensee's determination. The TFSRA may then \"investigate the dispute in any manner it chooses,\" including by granting an administrative hearing. If such a hearing occurs, consumers can be represented by counsel at their own expense, and the TFSRA can conduct matters before and during the hearing in a quasi-judicial manner. After any hearing, the TFSRA must issue a written decision that contains its factual findings and conclusions of law, and \"may grant or deny any relief as the [TFSRA] determines appropriate.\"\n   <footnotemark>\n    2\n   </footnotemark>\n   Consumers can then request rehearing, which the TFSRA may grant or deny at its discretion.\n   <em>\n    Id.\n   </em>\n   \u00a7 9.3(a)-(g). Finally, consumers may appeal adverse TFSRA decisions by filing a written petition for review with the Tribal Court (\"the LVD Court\") within ninety days of the TFSRA's decision. The LVD Court's review is limited to the TFSRA's administrative record, and the Court must give deference to the TFSRA's interpretations and applications of the Code. It can only reverse a decision that is \"arbitrary and capricious, or that ... is not supported by the evidence,\" and must not reverse because of \"[m]ere disagreement with the [TFSRA]'s factual findings.\" The LVD Court's subsequent opinion is final and cannot be appealed.\n   <em>\n    Id.\n   </em>\n   \u00a7 9.4.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-21\">\n   The latest development in the Tribe's history of economic regulation occurred on\n   August 26, 2014, when the LVD Council enacted the Business Entity Ordinance (\"the Business Ordinance\"). Aug. 28 Resolution (ECF No. 23-6) at 1-2. The Business Ordinance created comprehensive procedures for the creation, operation, and dissolution of various tribal entities, including limited liability companies (\"LLCs\").\n   <em>\n    See generally\n   </em>\n   Business Ordinance (ECF No. 23-7). Relevant to this dispute, the Ordinance stated that a tribally-owned LLC with the Tribe as its sole member would \"be considered a wholly owned and operated instrumentality of the Tribe and ... have all the privileges and immunities of the Tribe, including but not limited to the Tribe's sovereign immunity from suit, except as explicitly waived by the [LVD] Council.\"\n   <em>\n    Id.\n   </em>\n   Ch. 5, \u00a7 8(E). The Ordinance further indicated that those LLCs would be subject to the LVD Court's jurisdiction, but that such provision would not waive any claim to sovereign immunity in state or federal court.\n   <em>\n    Id.\n   </em>\n   Ch. 1, \u00a7 3(A), (D).\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-22\">\n   <strong>\n    2. Beginning of Tribal Lending Operations\n   </strong>\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-23\">\n   Soon after the Code was enacted, the Tribe began operating in the online lending arena when the LVD Council organized Red Rock Tribal Lending, LLC (\"Red Rock\") as a tribally-owned LLC on September 14, 2011.\n   <em>\n    See\n   </em>\n   Sept. 14, 2011 Resolution (ECF No. 23-8). The company was managed by two members of the Tribe, and the Tribe was Red Rock's sole member. Red Rock Arts. of Organization (ECF No. 23-9), Art. 7; Hazen Aff. \u00b6\u00b6 6-7. The Complaint alleges that Matt Martorello (\"Martorello\")-along with Bellicose Capital, LLC (\"Bellicose\")\n   <footnotemark>\n    3\n   </footnotemark>\n   and Bellicose's general counsel, Daniel Gravel (\"Gravel\")-associated with the Tribe to form Red Rock. Compl. (ECF No. 1) \u00b6\u00b6 13, 29. Martorello, however, states that he was never a manager or member of Red Rock, nor were any of the companies that he owned or managed. Martorello Decl. (ECF No. 106-1) \u00b6\u00b6 18-21. Red Rock provided loans to consumers from its offices on the Reservation, and its employees, computers, and records were all located there. Moreover, as a tribal business, Red Rock was regulated by the TFSRA. Hazen Aff. \u00b6\u00b6 8-9.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-24\">\n   Red Rock subsequently decided to contract with an outside entity to better learn the lending industry. The Tribe had identified Martorello as a potential consultant in mid-2011, but he was not involved in the creation of Red Rock. Martorello Decl. \u00b6\u00b6 14, 17. Then, on October 25, 2011, Red Rock contracted with Bellicose VI, LLC (\"Bellicose VI\")-a subsidiary of Bellicose-for it to provide Red Rock with vendor management services, compliance management assistance, marketing material development, and risk modeling and data analytics development. Hazen Aff. \u00b6 10; Servicing Agm't\n   <footnotemark>\n    4\n   </footnotemark>\n   (ECF No. 83-2) at 1. On April 15, 2012, Bellicose VI assigned its interest in the contract to SourcePoint VI, LLC (\"SourcePoint\"), another Bellicose subsidiary. Hazen Aff. \u00b6 12; Servicing Agm't at 1.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-25\">\n   The Servicing Agreement detailed the revenue distribution structure for Red Rock's lending business and each party's duties as to that business. Under the contract, revenues were distributed first to Red Rock, which received 2% of all gross revenues \"plus bad debt recoveries minus the sum of charge backs and bad debt\n   charge-offs.\" Servicing Agm't \u00a7\u00a7 2.25, 6.4.1. The remainder was then distributed in the following order: (1) to SourcePoint, to reimburse it for advances made to Red Rock and for servicing expenses; (2) to any of Red Rock's creditors, to pay outstanding debt that was then due; and (3) to SourcePoint, to pay its monthly servicing fee.\n   <em>\n    Id.\n   </em>\n   \u00a7 6.4.2-. 5. The servicing fee was a variable performance-based fee equivalent to whatever cash basis revenue remained after the distributions above, and was at a minimum $20,000.\n   <em>\n    Id.\n   </em>\n   \u00a7 3.5.1. Martorello claims that the Tribe itself suggested this revenue split because it guaranteed monthly income for the Tribe's general fund while also incentivizing SourcePoint to help the Tribe grow its businesses. Martorello Decl. \u00b6 36. In addition, aside from these distributions, Red Rock received and retained ownership of all intellectual property developed under the Servicing Agreement by SourcePoint.\n   <em>\n    Id.\n   </em>\n   \u00b6 35.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-26\">\n   The Agreement also assigned specific responsibilities to SourcePoint. For instance, after noting that SourcePoint was being engaged as Red Rock's \"independent contractor\" to perform the services noted, the Agreement granted to SourcePoint \"the authority and responsibility over all communication and interaction whatsoever between [Red Rock] and each service provider, lender and other agents of [Red Rock].\"\n   <em>\n    Id.\n   </em>\n   \u00a7 3.1. The contract also prevented Red Rock from operating its lending business anywhere without using SourcePoint to provide its management and consulting services for those operations.\n   <em>\n    Id.\n   </em>\n   \u00a7 3.3.1. In addition, the Servicing Agreement required SourcePoint to select a bank account to store all funds generated by Red Rock's lending, and gave SourcePoint-unless otherwise agreed between Red Rock and SourcePoint-the \"sole signatory and transfer authority over such bank accounts,\" as well as \"sole authority to sweep monies from such bank accounts\" to distribute revenues under the priority structure.\n   <em>\n    Id.\n   </em>\n   \u00a7 4.4. Finally, the Agreement gave SourcePoint numerous other duties concerning the day-to-day functioning of Red Rock's lending business, such as: (1) \"[s]creening of and selecting service providers and lenders, and negotiating agreements with such service providers and lenders on behalf of [Red Rock]\"; (2) \"[d]evelopment and promotion of sound and positive business relationships on behalf of [Red Rock] with the designated service providers and lenders\"; (3) preparation of regulatory, compliance, training, education, financial reporting and accounting, website content, and marketing standards; (4) \"providing pre-qualified leads to [Red Rock] and providing the necessary credit-modeling data and risk assessment strategies\" to Red Rock; and (5) \"training and monitoring [Red Rock] employees ... that operate [Red Rock]'s call center.\"\n   <em>\n    Id.\n   </em>\n   \u00a7 4.2.1.\n   <footnotemark>\n    5\n   </footnotemark>\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-27\">\n   However, the Servicing Agreement also limited the ultimate authority of SourcePoint over Red Rock's management decisions. For instance, the provision allowing SourcePoint to provide leads and credit-modeling data to Red Rock also said that \"[t]he criteria used to extend funds to individual borrowers will remain within the sole and absolute discretion of [Red Rock] and [Red Rock] shall execute all necessary loan documentation.\"\n   <em>\n    Id.\n   </em>\n   \u00a7 4.2.1(i). Similarly,\n   SourcePoint \"ha[d] no authority to engage in origination activities, execute loan documentation, or approve the issuance of loans to third parties. Final determination as to whether to lend to a consumer rest[ed] with [Red Rock].\"\n   <em>\n    Id.\n   </em>\n   \u00a7 4.1.1. SourcePoint also needed the Tribe's written consent \"to do any of the following: (1) to borrow, pledge, assign, convey, encumber, grant security interest in, guaranty, or otherwise restrict the assets of [Red Rock]; (2) to sell or otherwise dispose of all or substantially all of the assets of [Red Rock]; [or] (3) to waive the sovereign immunity of [Red Rock].\"\n   <em>\n    Id.\n   </em>\n   \u00a7 4.1.2. In other words, SourcePoint's duties, although numerous, were to be limited to providing \"reasonable measures for the orderly administration and management\" of Red Rock.\n   <em>\n    Id.\n   </em>\n   \u00a7 4.2.1.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-28\">\n   Some evidence also indicates that Red Rock's role under the Servicing Agreement was more substantial than Plaintiffs suggest. Red Rock's co-manager, Michelle Hazen (\"Hazen\"), says that, \"[w]hile Red Rock received advice and consulted with Bellicose about operations, all final decisions about operations were made by Red Rock's managers.\" Hazen Aff. \u00b6 11;\n   <em>\n    see also\n   </em>\n   ECF No. 83-4 (e-mail from SourcePoint employee to tribal members recommending adoption of direct mail campaign prepared by SourcePoint). Similarly, Martorello indicates that, as a consultant,\n   <footnotemark>\n    6\n   </footnotemark>\n   he \"made suggestions and offered advice to Red Rock's co-managers,\" but \"Red Rock's co-managers were ultimately responsible for all decisions regarding Red Rock's operation.\" Furthermore, Martorello, Bellicose, and SourcePoint never, on Red Rock's behalf, made lending decisions; originated a consumer loan; purchased a loan originated by Red Rock; or took any action to collect a Red Rock loan. Instead, Red Rock always made the final decision to lend to a particular consumer, and Red Rock's co-managers, including Hazen, always reviewed and approved marketing materials, including the prescreening of credit reports.\n   <footnotemark>\n    7\n   </footnotemark>\n   Finally, Bellicose's and SourcePoint's access to Red Rock's bank accounts was limited by deposit access control agreements provided by Red Rock, which Red Rock or the Tribe could terminate at any time. Furthermore, although Martorello was a signatory on certain Red Rock accounts, he claims that he was listed that way only \"to facilitate accounts payable, and never without express contractual or delegated authority.\" Martorello Decl. \u00b6\u00b6 22-28.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-29\">\n   Red Rock then began making loans to consumers, including some in New York. In February 2013, the New York Department of Financial Services (\"the Department\") sent cease-and-desist letters to a number of lending entities, including the Tribe, accusing them of \"using the Internet to offer and originate illegal payday loans to New York consumers, in violation of New York's civil and criminal usury laws.\"\n   <footnotemark>\n    8\n   </footnotemark>\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-30\">\n   <em>\n    Otoe-Missouria Tribe of Indians v.

The Department also sent letters to third parties that credit and debit payday loan payments, advising them that the Department would pursue enforcement actions against lenders that refused to cease and desist.\n   <em>\n    <extracted-citation case-ids=\"4231994\" index=\"1\" url=\"https://cite.case.law/f-supp-2d/974/353/#p356\">\n     Id.\n    </extracted-citation>\n   </em>\n   <extracted-citation case-ids=\"4231994\" index=\"1\" url=\"https://cite.case.law/f-supp-2d/974/353/#p356\">\n    at 356-57\n   </extracted-citation>\n   . This threat of regulatory enforcement caused the lending entities' business partners to limit or end their relationship with the entities, which in turn led the entities to seek a preliminary injunction preventing the Department from enforcing New York's anti-usury statutes against them-in part because any regulation would infringe on the entities' tribal sovereignty.\n   <em>\n    See\n   </em>\n   <em>\n    <extracted-citation case-ids=\"4231994\" index=\"2\" url=\"https://cite.case.law/f-supp-2d/974/353/#p356\">\n     id.\n    </extracted-citation>\n   </em>\n   <extracted-citation case-ids=\"4231994\" index=\"2\" url=\"https://cite.case.law/f-supp-2d/974/353/#p356\">\n    at 357-58\n   </extracted-citation>\n   . However, the court denied the entities' request, finding that they had not shown a likelihood of success on the merits because their online lending to New York consumers constituted off-reservation activity, and could therefore be properly regulated under New York's non-discriminatory anti-usury laws.\n   <em>\n    See\n   </em>\n   <em>\n    <extracted-citation case-ids=\"4231994\" index=\"3\" url=\"https://cite.case.law/f-supp-2d/974/353/#p356\">\n     id.\n    </extracted-citation>\n   </em>\n   <extracted-citation case-ids=\"4231994\" index=\"3\" url=\"https://cite.case.law/f-supp-2d/974/353/#p356\">\n    at 360-61\n   </extracted-citation>\n   .

The Tribe's response to these decisions is unknown.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-31\">\n   <strong>\n    3. Expansion of Tribal Lending Business\n   </strong>\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-32\">\n   After 2011, through its operation of Red Rock and relationship with Bellicose and Martorello, the Tribe gained knowledge of the online lending industry. Hazen Aff. \u00b6 13; Martorello Decl. \u00b6\u00b6 47-48. The Tribe wanted to apply that knowledge to expand its online lending platform and increase profitability for the Tribe, employ more tribal members, and acquire its vendors' businesses so that the Tribe would earn more money. Hazen Aff. \u00b6 13. As part of that strategy, the LVD Council organized Big Picture on August 26, 2014. Aug. 26, 2014 Resolution (ECF No. 23-10). Big Picture was formed \"as a wholly owned and operated instrumentality of the Tribe,\" and was managed by two tribal members, Hazen and James Williams (\"Williams\").\n   <em>\n    Id.\n   </em>\n   at 2-3. Big Picture was meant to serve as an independent tribal lending entity that would \"ultimately consolidate the business\" of the Tribe's other lending entities, Red Rock and Duck Creek Tribal Financial, LLC.\n   <em>\n    Id.\n   </em>\n   at 1.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-33\">\n   On February 5, 2015, the LVD Council formed another entity, Tribal Economic Development Holdings, LLC (\"TED\"), to operate the Tribe's current and future lending companies. Feb. 5, 2015 TED Resolution (ECF No. 23-13). The Tribe was the sole member of TED, and Hazen and Williams were designated as its co-managers.\n   <em>\n    Id.\n   </em>\n   at 3; TED Arts. of Organization (ECF No. 23-14), Arts. 8-9. Big Picture's membership was also restructured so that TED became its sole member. Big Picture Arts. of Organization (ECF No. 23-13), Arts. 8-9. Then, also on February 5, the LVD Council formed Ascension as a subsidiary of TED \"for the purpose of engaging in marketing, technological and vendor services\" to support the Tribe's lending entities. Feb. 5, 2015 Ascension Resolution (ECF No. 23-16) at 1.

Tribe's Acquisition of Bellicose\n   </strong>\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-35\">\n   Since 2012, Martorello and the Tribe had engaged in multiple conversations\n   about the potential sale of Martorello's consulting companies to the Tribe, which would allow the Tribe to engage in online lending without relying on outside vendors for support services. The creation of TED and Ascension and reorganization of Big Picture in February 2015 were undertaken to enable the Tribe to more easily purchase Bellicose, in part because those steps added layers to protect the Tribe from liability. Martorello Decl. \u00b6\u00b6 49-50; Martorello Sept. 11, 2015 E-mail (ECF No. 83-8) at LVD-DEF00014697. In addition, around that time, the LVD Council formed Tribal Acquisition Company, LLC (\"TAC\"), with TED as its sole member and Hazen and Williams as co-managers, for the sole purpose of acquiring Bellicose without creating a nexus between TED and Delaware. Sept. 14, 2015 Merger Resolution (ECF No. 34-2) (\"the Merger Resolution\") at 2; Martorello Sept. 11, 2015 E-mail at LVD-DEF00014697.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-36\">\n   In early 2015, the parties agreed on the basic framework of the merger: a seller-financed transaction with non-fixed payments over a seven-year term, with any outstanding amount due being forgiven at the end of that term. According to Martorello, the Tribe requested this structure because it would enable the Tribe to accomplish its goals of economic self-sufficiency more easily. Martorello Decl. \u00b6 51. The seller-financier would be Eventide Credit Acquisitions, LLC (\"Eventide\"), a company managed and majority-owned by multiple entities of which Martorello was the president. Merger Resolution at 3; Eventide Operating Agm't, Sched. A (ECF No. 91-11). Eventide would provide a $300 million loan to TED, which TED would then use to purchase Bellicose. Merger Resolution at 3. After this structure was set, Martorello continued negotiating with the Tribe over the next several months. Martorello Decl. \u00b6 52. The parties reached a final agreement on September 14, 2015, memorializing the terms of the deal in a loan agreement (\"the Loan Agreement\") and a promissory note (\"the Note\"). Merger Resolution at 7-9;\n   <em>\n    see generally\n   </em>\n   Loan Agreement (ECF No. 83-17); Note (ECF No. 83-11). As part of the transaction, the LVD Council approved a limited waiver of TED's and Big Picture's sovereign immunity in connection with TED's repayment of the Eventide loan during its seven-year term.\n   <em>\n    See\n   </em>\n   Sept. 14, 2015 Immunity Waiver Resolution (ECF No. 34-3) at 2-8. On January 26, 2016, the Tribe finally completed its purchase of Bellicose, including subsidiaries like SourcePoint, and acquired all of Bellicose's data, software, and corporate goodwill. Martorello Decl. \u00b6 53; Hazen Aff. \u00b6 22.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-37\">\n   Under the Note, revenues from Big Picture's lending business are distributed monthly in several steps. First, Big Picture makes a distribution to TED of Big Picture's gross revenues. Note \u00a7 1.2(a); Martorello Decl. \u00b6 57. TED then distributes 2% of those gross revenues to the Tribe, until half of the total loan amount has been paid, at which time the distribution percentage increases from 2% to 4%. Note \u00a7 1.2(b) (1). The parties agreed to increase the monthly distribution from 2% to 3% in or around September 2016.\n   <footnotemark>\n    9\n   </footnotemark>\n   Note Addendum (ECF No. 91-18); Martorello Decl. \u00b6 57. If TED defaults under the Loan Agreement, then the monthly distribution to the Tribe reduces to zero. Note \u00a7 1.2(b) (1);\n   <em>\n    see also\n   </em>\n   Loan Agreement \u00a7 6.1 (describing events triggering default). Second, TED pays an additional 2% of gross revenues to the Tribe to be reinvested \"in\n   growing the loan portfolio.\"\n   <footnotemark>\n    10\n   </footnotemark>\n   Note \u00a7 1.2(b)(2). That reinvestment amount must \"stay in equity within [TED] or [Big Picture] conducting lending\" until the Note and Loan Agreement terminate. As with the first distribution, this payment reduces to zero if TED defaults. Note \u00a7 1.2(b)(2). Third, TED and Big Picture must pay any interest and principal due to other creditors.\n   <em>\n    Id.\n   </em>\n   \u00a7 1.2(b)(3).\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-38\">\n   Fourth, an amount is deducted to pay \"[o]rdinary and necessary business expenses\" incurred in connection with Big Picture's lending business, including payments to tribal and non-tribal vendors.\n   <footnotemark>\n    11\n   </footnotemark>\n   <em>\n    Id.\n   </em>\n   \u00a7 1.2(b)(4); Martorello Decl. \u00b6 57. Those expenses may not exceed reasonable rates for particular services, and TED and Big Picture have a fiduciary duty to Eventide to ensure that they do not \"undermine the [p]arties' intent to maximize the cash flows directed to retire the Note as soon as possible.\" Note \u00a7 1.2(b)(4). Accordingly, TED must submit a monthly budget and expense report to Eventide, which Eventide uses to ensure that the expenses are reasonable and not inflated to deprive Eventide of payments it will receive under the Note.\n   <em>\n    Id.\n   </em>\n   \u00a7 1.2(c); Martorello Decl. \u00b6 59. The Note allows expenses based on a \"reasonable expansion\" of Big Picture's lending operations in light of \"industry climate and norms.\" Note \u00a7 1.2(b)(4)(b). Nonetheless, Eventide must approve a budget for such expansion to ensure that TED's repayment of the loan is not affected.\n   <em>\n    Id.\n   </em>\n   Martorello claims that Eventide has \"never unreasonably withheld its consent to expenses, nor has it objected to the reasonable expansion of the business-even when expansion created additional debt for Big Picture which meant smaller (or no) payments to Eventide.\" Martorello Decl. \u00b6 60.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-39\">\n   Finally, TED pays to Eventide the \"Net Cash Available\"-that is, Big Picture's gross revenues minus all the distributions and deductions above. That amount is applied first to any unpaid principal, and then to unpaid interest.\n   <footnotemark>\n    12\n   </footnotemark>\n   Note \u00a7 1.2. As Martorello explains, because Eventide receives payments last under the Note's distribution structure, it is possible that Eventide will not receive a principal payment in some months because TED has no net income from which to make a payment. This situation has occurred on at least five occasions. TED, on the other hand, has always received all of Big Picture's net income, and is guaranteed to receive its 3% distribution and reinvestment amount every month. Martorello Decl. \u00b6 63.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-40\">\n   Each payment to Eventide under the waterfall structure is accompanied by a payment schedule. Note \u00a7 1.2(c). Based on these schedules, and other financial statements, Martorello states that TED has consistently paid down its principal under the Note, such that the Tribe has been receiving an equity interest in the lending\n   support services that it acquired through Bellicose. He notes that, since the close of the acquisition, Eventide's Note payments have amounted to $21,375,922.10, whereas the total economic consideration obtained by the Tribe under the Note has been $28,184,007.69. Martorello Decl. \u00b6 63; McFadden Aff. (ECF No. 106-17) \u00b6 17. However, the exact basis of those figures is unclear. In fact, Plaintiffs cite two documents with different numbers than those provided by Martorello. One indicates that, as of June 2017, the cumulative repayment to Eventide was $17,968,528.36, and the cumulative amount to TED was $4,924,930.94 ($1,963,708.81 in distributions, and $2,961,222.13 in reinvestments). Pls. Opp. (ECF No. 90) at 11, 21-22. The second shows slightly higher numbers than those through December 2017.\n   <em>\n    See\n   </em>\n   <em>\n    id.\n   </em>\n   Those figures are consistent with Big Picture's assertion that, by September 2017, TED had distributed approximately $20.5 million in loan payments to Eventide and nearly $5 million to the Tribe ($3,035,374.90 in distributions, and $1,948,999.53 in reinvestments). Big Picture Suppl. Interrogatory Responses (ECF No. 102-3) \u00b6 1. Martorello's calculations might include amounts not accounted for in those spreadsheets, such as the economic value of Bellicose's data or corporate goodwill, but that is hard to discern. In any event, the Note is fixed to expire seven years after its execution date-thus, by September 14, 2022-at which time \"the remaining balance is forgiven.\" Note \u00a7 1.3.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-41\">\n   The Tribe finished restructuring its lending businesses soon after the Bellicose purchase. TAC dissolved in late January 2016 after control of Bellicose had been transferred to TED. Arts. of Dissolution (ECF No. 91-9). Around the same time, Bellicose's assets were assigned to Ascension and its liabilities were assigned to Big Picture, and Bellicose ceased to exist. Shortly thereafter, on February 16, 2016, Big Picture engaged Ascension as an independent contractor to provide Big Picture with the servicing support services that Ascension had carried over from Bellicose. Intratribal Servicing Agm't (ECF No. 91-17) \u00a7 3.1;\n   <em>\n    see also\n   </em>\n   McFadden Feb. 24, 2015 Letter (ECF No. 91-30) (noting that all Bellicose VI positions and operations would be merged into Ascension).\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-42\">\n   The Intratribal Servicing Agreement is similar to the earlier Servicing Agreement between Red Rock and SourcePoint. In particular, the contract requires that Ascension \"develop and recommend to [Big Picture] ... reasonable measures for the orderly administration and management of [Big Picture] in the areas of financial reporting, financing, regulatory compliance, marketing, human resources, development of vendor relationships, collections and risk assessment,\" and then describes most of the same day-to-day operational responsibilities that SourcePoint had. Intratribal Servicing Agm't \u00a7 4.2.1;\n   <em>\n    see also\n   </em>\n   Servicing Agm't \u00a7 4.2.1. Ascension also receives a monthly fee, which is the sum of the following: (1) \"[m]anpower charges,\" which are Ascension's salary costs, payroll taxes, and other employment expenses; (2) internal expenses, which are capped by Ascension's servicing budget; (3) overhead expenses, in different amounts based on whether Big Picture is the beneficiary of such expenses; and (4) a bonus plan for Ascension's employees. Intratribal Servicing Agm't \u00a7 3.4.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-43\">\n   Big Picture, however, retains the same managerial authority as Red Rock. To that end, the Intratribal Servicing Agreement specifically provides that \"[t]he criteria used to extend funds to individual borrowers will remain within the sole and absolute discretion of [Big Picture] ... and [Big Picture] ... shall execute all necessary loan documentations.\"\n   <em>\n    Id.\n   </em>\n   \u00a7 4.2.1(k). Likewise, Ascension \"has no authority to\n   engage in origination activities, execute loan documentation, or approve the issuance of loans to consumers. Final determination as to whether to lend to a consumer rests with [Big Picture] ....\"\n   <em>\n    Id.\n   </em>\n   \u00a7 4.1. In addition, even though McFadden and Simon Liang (\"Liang\"), Ascension's controller, were added as authorized signers for Big Picture's bank accounts, ECF No. 83-23, their authority is bound by deposit account control and lockbox agreements, Intratribal Servicing Agm't \u00a7\u00a7 4.4, 4.7. The only real limitation on Big Picture's authority is the Loan Agreement, which prevents TED or Big Picture from amending or terminating the Intratribal Servicing Agreement during the loan's seven-year term without Eventide's written consent. Loan Agm't \u00a7 5.12.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-44\">\n   On the same day that Big Picture contracted with Ascension, the LVD Council also authorized Red Rock to assign the majority of its consumer loans and obligations to Big Picture. Hazen Aff. \u00b6 23; Feb. 16, 2016 Assignment Resolution (ECF No. 23-23) at 2-3;\n   <em>\n    see generally\n   </em>\n   Assignment Agm't (ECF No. 23-24).

Hazen Aff. \u00b6 23; Red Rock Arts. of Dissolution (ECF No. 23-27); Feb. 16, 2016 Dissolution Resolution (ECF No. 23-26). Hazen, as co-manager of Red Rock, gave the appropriate notice of dissolution to the TFSRA and to any party that might have claims against Red Rock.\n   <em>\n    See\n   </em>\n   ECF Nos. 23-28, 23-29. Big Picture then sent a notice of assignment to all consumers whose loans it had received, instructing them that Big Picture would begin collecting their loan payments effective February 17, 2016.

Big Picture currently employs fifteen individuals on the Reservation. Ascension employs thirty-one individuals, most of whom work outside the Reservation at Ascension's satellite offices, Hazen Aff. \u00b6\u00b6 24-25, which appear to be in (at least) Atlanta, Mississippi, and Puerto Rico, Compl. \u00b6\u00b6 50-53. Hazen and Williams, both LVD Council members, co-manage all three companies. Hazen Aff. \u00b6\u00b6 2, 15, 18-20; Williams Aff. (ECF No. 23-36) \u00b6\u00b6 1, 11-13. That position grants them the broad authority to, in the case of Big Picture, \"perform all actions as may be necessary or appropriate to carry out the business of [Big Picture] including but not limited to the power to enter into contracts for services, to manage vendor relationships, to manage personnel issues and affairs of [Big Picture].\" Big Picture Operating Agm't \u00a7 5.1(a).\n   <footnotemark>\n    13\n   </footnotemark>\n   Where the managers' power is limited by the operating agreements, the ultimate authority resides in the LVD Council.\n   <em>\n    See\n   </em>\n   <em>\n    id.\n   </em>\n   \u00a7 5.2. Similarly, all three entities must submit quarterly reports to either the LVD Council (for TED) or TED (for Big Picture and Ascension).\n   <em>\n    Id.\n   </em>\n   \u00a7 5.8; TED Operating Agm't \u00a7 4.7; Ascension Operating Agm't \u00a7 5.8.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-47\">\n   Hazen has been Big Picture's CEO since December 2015. Hazen Aff. \u00b6 20. However, as for Ascension, Hazen and Williams have delegated to McFadden: (1) the \"approval of Ascension strategic direction,\" which must be communicated at least quarterly\n   to the co-managers; (2) \"authority to execute documents on behalf of Ascension\"; (3) \"authority to open and maintain bank accounts\"; (4) \"authority to adopt, terminate, or change employee benefit plans or programs\"; and (5) \"authority regarding all matters necessary for ... day to day management.\" Ascension Delegation of Authority Policy (ECF No. 91-13) \u00a7 1.4. McFadden must report regularly to Hazen and Williams about the authority exercised under those provisions and any matters that might fall under their purview.\n   <em>\n    Id.\n   </em>\n   \u00a7 1.5. McFadden also must obtain co-manager approval \"for changes in operations, personnel, and distributions.\" McFadden Aff. \u00b6 8.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-48\">\n   Martorello asserts that he has had limited contact with the Tribe since it purchased Bellicose in January 2016. As he states, he has never been involved in TED's operations, made any decisions on its behalf, provided any consulting services to it, or solicited any investors on its behalf. Likewise, he has never provided any consulting services to Big Picture or Ascension; suggested marketing strategies, underwriting criteria, or other policies to them; accessed any of their software systems, databases, bank accounts, or records; or hired or fired their employees. Martorello has interacted with Hazen and Williams when they have requested Eventide's permission to undertake expenses for Big Picture that exceeded budgeted expenses under the Note, but Martorello never proposed that they incur those expenses, nor did he object to their requests. Martorello Decl. \u00b6\u00b6 70-97;\n   <em>\n    see also\n   </em>\n   McFadden Aff. \u00b6\u00b6 13-16. Furthermore, says McFadden, neither Eventide nor Martorello participates in Ascension's day-to-day operations, and Ascension does not seek Eventide's or Martorello's consent for those operations, except if Ascension needs to expand its budget. Even in that case, explains McFadden, he would first obtain Hazen's or Williams' approval before contacting Eventide. McFadden Aff. \u00b6\u00b6 10-12.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-49\">\n   Big Picture operates in some ways as an independent financial entity. It maintains its operating account with a regional bank, where it funds all its loans, receives all consumer payments, pays all payroll and vendors, deposits all its investments, and makes distributions to TED and the Tribe.\n   <footnotemark>\n    14\n   </footnotemark>\n   Big Picture relies on private investors to fund its lending operation, including the loans themselves. These investments are made through traditional loan agreements and promissory notes, under which Big Picture is responsible to each investor. Hazen Aff. \u00b6\u00b6 26-27. The Tribe itself has invested over $7 million. Williams Aff. \u00b6 8.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-50\">\n   Moreover, Big Picture's lending operation has yielded concrete financial benefits for the Tribe. Any profits that Big Picture earns are allocated to its sole member, TED, which in turn allocates those profits to the Tribe. Big Picture Operating Agm't \u00a7 6.1; TED Operation Agm't \u00a7 6.1.\n   <footnotemark>\n    15\n   </footnotemark>\n   If Big Picture's cash account balance exceeds $500, it must declare an immediate distribution and transfer the excess to TED. Big Picture Operating Agm't \u00a7 6.2. It is unclear if this always occurs, as e-mails from Liang to Martorello about repayment of Eventide's loan contain language indicating that Big Picture's cash balance was greater than $500, but that Big Picture \"would like to keep [the balance] for lead acquisition and loan origination in future months.\"\n   <em>\n    See, e.g.\n   </em>\n   , ECF No. 83-24 at\n   MARTORELLO_000218. In any event, beyond the profits obtained through the Note's revenue distributions, the Tribe also receives interest payments as a substantial investor in Big Picture. Proceeds from Big Picture's business now comprise more than 10% of the Tribe's general fund, and those profits could possibly fund more than 30% of the Tribe's budget over the next few years. Williams Aff. \u00b6\u00b6 9-10.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-51\">\n   The Tribe relies on Big Picture's funds for governmental programs and services.\n   <em>\n    Id.\n   </em>\n   \u00b6 10. Specifically, Big Picture's revenues have been used to, in whole or in part: meet requirements necessary to secure $14.1 million in financing for the Tribe's new health clinic; refinance casino debt; fund college scholarships and pay for educational costs for members such as student housing, books, school supplies and equipment; create home ownership opportunities for members through tribally-purchased homes; subsidize tribal members' home purchases and rentals; provide a bridge loan to complete the new tribal health clinic that offers services to the regional community; fund new vehicles for the Tribe's Police Department; fund an Ojibwe language program and other cultural programs; provide foster care payments for eligible children, propane purchase assistance, and assistance for family care outside of the community; cover burial and other funeral expenses for members' families; fund renovations and new office space for the Tribe's Social Services Department; fund youth activities; renovate a new space for the LVD Court and bring in telecom services for remote court proceedings; and fund tribal elder nutrition programs and tribal elder home care and transport services.

Big Picture's Lending Process\n   </strong>\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-53\">\n   As noted, Big Picture has its principal place of business on the Reservation, and its employees are all located there. The servers for Big Picture's websites are also stored on the Reservation. And, because all loan applications are approved by Big Picture employees on the Reservation, all consumer loans are originated there.\n   <em>\n    Id.\n   </em>\n   \u00b6\u00b6 28, 30(a).\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-54\">\n   To obtain a loan from Big Picture, consumers must log onto the company's website and complete and submit an application. Big Picture then conducts a review using a software-based underwriting process and either accepts or denies the application.\n   <em>\n    Id.\n   </em>\n   \u00b6 30(a)-(b). That software consolidates consumer credit data from third-party service providers to verify applicants' information and determine creditworthiness. Big Picture Interrogatory Responses \u00b6 24. An applicant receives a notice of denial if the application is denied. Hazen Aff. \u00b6 30 (d).\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-55\">\n   Even if an application is accepted, the consumer must complete several more steps before the loan is finalized. First, the website prompts applicants to select their desired loan amount, which may be as high as $5,000. Second, applicants must select the term of the loan, and Big Picture in turn provides an estimated annual percentage rate (\"APR\") based on the underwriting software's determination of an applicant's repayment ability. Third, applicants must review Big Picture's standard loan agreement, which includes the loan's APR and repayment schedule. Fourth, applicants must acknowledge their review of, and agree to, the loan agreement-including the choice-of-law, forum-selection, and jury trial waiver clauses-and Big Picture's privacy disclosures. Finally, applicants must select their payment method.\n   <em>\n    Id.\n   </em>\n   \u00b6 30(c)(1)-(6).\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-56\">\n   Once a consumer signs the loan agreement, the contract goes to Big Picture for its employees' review. Employees on the Reservation perform a final verification of\n   the applicant's information in the loan agreement and other details. If there are no issues, the reviewing employee manually enters the date of disbursal of funds, which authorizes electronic approval of the agreement. This action also causes the loan to be originated and triggers the transmission of instructions for the particular application to a third-party payment processor, which then disburses the funds to the consumer.\n   <em>\n    Id.\n   </em>\n   \u00b6 30(c)(7)-(8).\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-57\">\n   <strong>\n    7.

However, the Complaint alleges that Martorello and Gravel intentionally chose Virginia as a place where Red Rock and Big Picture would offer loans and collect payments, and they proceeded with this plan notwithstanding their knowledge that the loans would be illegal under Virginia's usury laws. Certain defendants then began marketing, initiating, and collecting loans in Virginia. Consumers were required to electronically sign the form loan agreement described above. Under the terms of that contract, the loans were subject to an APR that was much higher than 12%. However, neither the Tribe nor any of the defendants had a consumer finance license permitting them to charge interest at such a high rate, and they never attempted to obtain such a license.

Such placement would effectively assume the truth of Big Picture's and Ascension's assertion that they should be immune from suit in the same way as the Tribe itself. \"Arm-of-the-tribe cases, however, require the court to decide an antecedent question: whether [the entities] can claim sovereign immunity in the first instance.\"\n   <em>\n    <extracted-citation case-ids=\"12513359\" index=\"66\" url=\"https://cite.case.law/cal-rptr-3d/211/837/\">\n     Id.\n    </extracted-citation>\n   </em>\n   (alteration in original) (internal quotations omitted).

At the same time, even if the parties can access the same evidence, one side must present it in a way that convinces the Court to make a particular decision, and there is no reason that Big Picture and Ascension should be freed from having to do so before the Court finds that they are entitled to tribal immunity.

Plaintiffs have presented credible evidence that, following that decision, Martorello and the Tribe looked for ways to restructure Red Rock's lending operation in order to reduce exposure to liability. Indeed, several steps in February 2015-the formation of TED and Ascension, the reorganization of Big Picture with TED as its sole member, and the initiation of the Tribe's Bellicose purchase-were apparently taken with that very goal in mind. Moreover, although Red Rock was formed as a tribal entity, Bellicose and its subsidiaries, like SourcePoint, were a critical part of Red Rock's business. Thus, by creating Big Picture and Ascension, the Tribe was not starting an independent lending operation but rather facilitating the absorption of Red Rock's fully-functioning lending enterprise-which had a decidedly non-tribal character, given Bellicose's involvement. Big Picture and Ascension may be right that Hazen's lack of knowledge about the decision to create Big Picture is not meaningful on its own. But, viewed in context, Hazen's unawareness teaches that the impetus behind the formation of Big Picture and Ascension was Martorello and Bellicose's desire to avoid liability, more so than the Tribe's interest in starting its own business.

However, as set out in Section II.B.1 above, the record shows that the formation of Big Picture and Ascension, and indeed, much of the tribal restructuring, was for the real purpose of helping Martorello and Bellicose to avoid liability, rather than to help the Tribe start a business. And, that finding means that Big Picture and Ascension have not carried their burden on the purpose factor.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-103\">\n   Plaintiffs also contend that Big Picture and Ascension do not fulfill their stated purposes in practice. First, they say, Big Picture and Ascension have not provided any information about the number of jobs created for the Tribe or the amount of revenue received by the Tribe from their business. Second, they note that Ascension does not employ any tribal members and generates no revenue for the Tribe. Third, they assert that Big Picture is structured such that the primary beneficiaries are Hazen (who is paid more than the other tribal employees of Big Picture) and Martorello (given that TED uses most of Big Picture's revenue to make loan payments to Eventide).\n   <footnotemark>\n    23\n   </footnotemark>\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-104\">\n   All three arguments have merit. First, Plaintiffs are wrong to claim that Big Picture and Ascension have provided no information about the revenue generated for the Tribe; Williams has explained that money from Big Picture constitutes more than 10% of the Tribe's general fund, and may contribute more than 30% of the fund within the next few years. Williams Aff. \u00b6 10. The Tribe obtains these funds both through TED's monthly 3% distributions, and as interest on its substantial investment in Big Picture's enterprise.\n   <em>\n    See\n   </em>\n   <em>\n    id.\n   </em>\n   \u00b6\u00b6 8-10. Nonetheless, courts assessing an entity's execution of purpose have examined how much revenue the tribe actually received from the entity.\n   <em>\n    See\n   </em>\n   <em>\n    Breakthrough\n   </em>\n   ,\n   <extracted-citation case-ids=\"4078435\" index=\"114\" url=\"https://cite.case.law/f3d/629/1173/#p1183\">\n    629 F.3d at 1192-93\n   </extracted-citation>\n   (concluding that entity's business \"clearly benefit[ed] the Tribe\" based on percentage allocation of revenue to certain tribal governmental functions);\n   <em>\n    Everette\n   </em>\n   ,\n   <extracted-citation case-ids=\"4265423\" index=\"115\" url=\"https://cite.case.law/f-supp-3d/146/720/#p723\">\n    146 F.Supp.3d at 724\n   </extracted-citation>\n   (noting that revenue was used \"to fund various tribal governmental, educational, and social services\" and to provide specified \"essential services\"). In that regard, Hazen's statement that those funds \"support LVD governmental essential services and support the LVD community\" in numerous ways, Hazen Aff. \u00b6 31, is far too general, as it sheds no light on how much Big Picture's revenue helped fund those services. That money might, for instance, constitute only a small, insignificant part of the funding for the services that Hazen has identified. If that is true, then Big Picture would not be effectively serving the Tribe's economic development. The evidence provided by Big Picture and Ascension, which bear the burden of proof here, is too vague to eliminate that possibility.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-105\">\n   Furthermore, even if Big Picture's revenue is a meaningful portion of the Tribe's general fund, the revenue received by the Tribe is a sliver of Big Picture's total earnings. The entity seeking immunity in\n   <em>\n    Breakthrough\n   </em>\n   provided 100% of its revenue to various tribal services.\n   <extracted-citation case-ids=\"4078435\" index=\"116\" url=\"https://cite.case.law/f3d/629/1173/#p1183\">\n    629 F.3d at 1192-93\n   </extracted-citation>\n   . Here, in contrast, the Note expressly limits the funds available to the Tribe to 5% of Big Picture's monthly revenue-the 3% monthly distribution and the 2% reinvestment amount, if the latter is treated as a current benefit to the Tribe.\n   <footnotemark>\n    24\n   </footnotemark>\n   <em>\n    See\n   </em>\n   Note \u00a7 1.2.\n   <em>\n    Breakthrough\n   </em>\n   did not specify any revenue allocation percentage that must be reached to reflect an adequate fit between purpose and execution, but\n   <em>\n    Miami Nation\n   </em>\n   noted that a similarly small revenue distribution-a monthly payment of either 1% of the entity's revenue or $25,000-would not economically benefit the tribe.\n   <em>\n    See\n   </em>\n   <extracted-citation case-ids=\"12513359\" index=\"117\" url=\"https://cite.case.law/cal-rptr-3d/211/837/\">\n    211 Cal.Rptr.3d 837\n   </extracted-citation>\n   ,\n   <extracted-citation case-ids=\"12513359\" index=\"118\" url=\"https://cite.case.law/cal-rptr-3d/211/837/\">\n    386 P.3d at 377-78\n   </extracted-citation>\n   . The evidence here further indicates that Big Picture has, over time, given the Tribe a little less than $5 million, whereas TED has made loan repayments to Eventide of about $20 million.\n   <footnotemark>\n    25\n   </footnotemark>\n   Big\n   Picture Suppl. Interrogatory Responses \u00b6 1. In other words, even under this broader view-which accounts for the months in which Eventide has not received any distribution-the Tribe has only received about 20% of Big Picture's total revenue, still a relatively small percentage. That imbalance shows that Big Picture has not served its stated purpose very well. And, even if Big Picture will not owe Eventide anything after the Note terminates in several years, Note \u00a7 1.3, the revenue distribution disparity will almost certainly have increased in that period, assuming Big Picture's revenue stream remains similar to what it has been since the parties entered into the Note.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-106\">\n   Ascension is in a very similar position. That company supports Big Picture's lending operations and generates no revenue itself,\n   <em>\n    see\n   </em>\n   Intratribal Servicing Agm't \u00a7 3.4, so the purpose analysis for Big Picture applies to Ascension in much the same way. Some evidence also demonstrates that Ascension fulfills its nominal purpose even less effectively than Big Picture. Whereas Big Picture's employees primarily belong to the Tribe and work on its reservation, Ascension does not employ any non-tribal members, instead relying mostly on employees that previously worked at Bellicose. That composition may have been justified when Ascension was formed in 2015 because the company needed individuals with certain technical knowledge for the required support services, and Bellicose's employees were the perfect candidates. But, in the several years since, Hazen's and Williams' testimony instructs that the Tribe has done little more than encourage tribal members to pursue educational opportunities that would allow them to work for Ascension and Big Picture in the future.\n   <footnotemark>\n    26\n   </footnotemark>\n   Thus, Ascension has failed to contribute much to the Tribe's self-governance, either directly (by supporting Big Picture's minimal revenue generation) or indirectly (by hiring tribal employees).\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-107\">\n   Finally, Big Picture's and Ascension's compensation structures underscore the companies' poor execution of their purposes. Despite what Plaintiffs claim, the evidence does not indicate that Martorello himself has received any substantial economic benefit from Big Picture, certainly not in the same sense as the non-tribal individuals in\n   <em>\n    Miami Nation\n   </em>\n   .\n   <em>\n    See\n   </em>\n   <extracted-citation case-ids=\"12513359\" index=\"119\" url=\"https://cite.case.law/cal-rptr-3d/211/837/\">\n    211 Cal.Rptr.3d 837\n   </extracted-citation>\n   ,\n   <extracted-citation case-ids=\"12513359\" index=\"120\" url=\"https://cite.case.law/cal-rptr-3d/211/837/\">\n    386 P.3d at 363, 378\n   </extracted-citation>\n   (noting that individuals used alleged tribal entities' checks to pay for their personal expenses). However, Plaintiffs' breakdown of the compensation of Hazen, other tribal employees of Big Picture, all employees of Ascension, and the total amount paid to Ascension by Big Picture clearly illustrates two things: (1) Hazen has profited from Big Picture's lending operation far more than any other tribal members, and (2) Ascension's employees are paid handsomely compared to Big Picture's employees. These compensation differences lead to the conclusion that Big Picture and Ascension primarily benefit individuals and entities outside the Tribe, or only one tribal leader, both of which are inconsistent with the goal of economic development.\n   <em>\n    See\n   </em>\n   <em>\n    <extracted-citation case-ids=\"12513359\" index=\"121\" url=\"https://cite.case.law/cal-rptr-3d/211/837/\">\n     id.,\n    </extracted-citation>\n   </em>\n   <extracted-citation case-ids=\"12513359\" index=\"122\" url=\"https://cite.case.law/cal-rptr-3d/211/837/\">\n    211 Cal.Rptr.3d 837\n   </extracted-citation>\n   ,\n   <extracted-citation case-ids=\"12513359\" index=\"123\" url=\"https://cite.case.law/cal-rptr-3d/211/837/\">\n    386 P.3d at 373\n   </extracted-citation>\n   .\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-108\">\n   Given these circumstances-and even granting that the fit between purpose and execution need not be exact,\n   <em>\n    <extracted-citation case-ids=\"12513359\" index=\"124\" url=\"https://cite.case.law/cal-rptr-3d/211/837/\">\n     id.,\n    </extracted-citation>\n   </em>\n   <extracted-citation case-ids=\"12513359\" index=\"125\" url=\"https://cite.case.law/cal-rptr-3d/211/837/\">\n    211 Cal.Rptr.3d 837\n   </extracted-citation>\n   ,\n   <extracted-citation case-ids=\"12513359\" index=\"126\" url=\"https://cite.case.law/cal-rptr-3d/211/837/\">\n    386 P.3d at\n   </extracted-citation>\n   372 -Big Picture and Ascension have largely failed to fulfill their stated purposes.

They acknowledge that the Agreement does not grant Ascension the authority to \"engage in origination activities, execute loan documentation, or approve the issuance of loans to consumers.\" Intratribal Servicing Agm't \u00a7 4.1.

Because Ascension generally identifies potential loan applicants by prescreening credit reports and then directs mass mailings to those consumers, Plaintiffs say, Big Picture's role is limited to verifying details at the loan approval stage. This minimal involvement is further shown by Williams' lack of knowledge about entities owned by Big Picture.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-113\">\n   Plaintiffs' argument relies on two underlying contentions: (1) that the Tribe's formal oversight of Big Picture is meaningless given Ascension's dominant role in Big Picture's lending operations; and (2) that, assuming Ascension has such a role, that entity is not controlled by the Tribe. Both arguments are persuasive. As to the first assertion, it is true that the Intratribal Servicing Agreement also states that \"[t]he criteria used to extend funds to individual borrowers will remain within the sole and absolute discretion\" of Big Picture, and that Big Picture \"shall execute all necessary loan documentation.\"\n   <em>\n    <extracted-citation case-ids=\"3774272\" index=\"140\" url=\"https://cite.case.law/f-supp-2d/842/1163/#p1176\">\n     Id.\n    </extracted-citation>\n   </em>\n   Nonetheless, considering that Ascension's responsibilities allow it to identify borrowers based on Ascension's own creditmodeling system and then prepare mass mailings to those consumers, it does not appear that Big Picture has much discretion to exercise when it receives recommendations or documents from Ascension. Indeed, Ascension's actions in effect reduce Hazen's and William's responsibilities in the loan process to pro forma review and approval of key business decisions.\n   <em>\n    See\n   </em>\n   ECF No. 91-3;\n   <em>\n    see also\n   </em>\n   Big Picture Interrogatory Responses \u00b6 24.

However, Williams' testimony about other issues, like his non-involvement in Big Picture's day-to-day and lack of knowledge about customer service representatives' responsibilities operations, demonstrates\n   that such oversight is narrow in both scope and depth. Consequently, Big Picture has not shown by a preponderance of the evidence that the Tribe, through Hazen and Williams, controls Big Picture, so this factor weighs against immunity for that entity.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-115\">\n   The question of Ascension's tribal control is not as close. Just like Big Picture, Ascension is an LLC that is 100% owned and operated by its sole member, TED. Ascension Arts. of Organization, Arts. 8-9.

Here, that inquiry revolves around the extent of Hazen and Williams' oversight of Ascension and the influence of non-tribal actors on Ascension's decisions.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-116\">\n   Ascension has presented evidence that McFadden must obtain Hazen's or Williams' approval for \"changes in operations, personnel, or distributions,\" McFadden Aff. \u00b6 8, and that Ascension employees have submitted request and approval forms to Hazen and Williams for certain business decisions, ECF No. 106-13. Ascension's operating agreement also reserves primary oversight of the company's actions for Hazen and Williams.\n   <em>\n    See\n   </em>\n   Ascension Operating Agm't \u00a7 5.1(a). Nonetheless, those assertions of oversight are undercut materially because Hazen and Williams have delegated to McFadden the authority to approve Ascension's \"strategic direction, goals and targets\"; execute documents on the company's behalf; open and maintain Ascension's bank accounts; adopt, terminate, or change employee benefit plans; and oversee \"all matters necessary for the day to day management of Ascension.\" Ascension Delegation of Authority Policy \u00a7 1.4. These actions are all important managerial ones that can significantly affect an entity's directions and its decisions. And, the evidence tends to show that the real management function lies not with Hazen and Williams, but with McFadden. On balance, that evidence augurs against Ascension's immunity claim.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-117\">\n   Plaintiffs make much of provisions in the Loan Agreement that prevent TED and Ascension from modifying the Intratribal Servicing Agreement or terminating or replacing any managers or officers of Ascension, among other entities, without Eventide's consent.

Although there is no evidence that these rights have been exercised, their mere presence is evidence that goes against a finding of immunity because they confer on Eventide, and hence Martorello, significant control mechanisms over significant aspects of Ascension's operations. On balance, the control factor slightly favors a finding against immunity. At best for Big Picture and Ascension, it is neutral, and thus does not aid them in meeting their burden of proof.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-118\">\n   <strong>\n    4.

Then, on this record, the intent factor weighs against a finding of immunity because to do otherwise is to ignore the driving force for the Tribe's intent to share its immunity.

Big Picture Operating Agm't \u00a7 4.3; Ascension Operating Agm't \u00a7 4.3.

Accordingly, neither company can satisfy this aspect of the financial relationship factor.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-127\">\n   Other evidence further establishes that Big Picture and Ascension lack a strong financial connection to the Tribe. The structure of the Note ensures that the Tribe's monthly gains will only consist of, at most, 5% of Big Picture's revenue. Thus, as described above, the Tribe has received a little less than 20% of the total revenue distributed under the Note. Because the Tribe receives a very small part of Big Picture's revenue, this factor does not cut the same way as in cases where \"all of [the entity's] profits inure [d] to the benefit of the Tribe.\"\n   <em>\n    Howard\n   </em>\n   ,\n   <extracted-citation index=\"165\" url=\"https://cite.case.law/citations/?q=2017%20WL%203669565\">\n    2017 WL 3669565\n   </extracted-citation>\n   , at *4 ;\n   <em>\n    see also\n   </em>\n   <em>\n    Breakthrough Mgmt.\n   </em>\n   ,\n   <extracted-citation case-ids=\"4078435\" index=\"166\" url=\"https://cite.case.law/f3d/629/1173/#p1183\">\n    629 F.3d at 1195\n   </extracted-citation>\n   (\"One hundred percent of the Casino's revenue goes to the Authority and then to the Tribe.\").\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-128\">\n   Furthermore, the other evidence that Big Picture and Ascension claim weighs in favor of immunity is unconvincing. First, notwithstanding the interest payments that the Tribe receives as an investor in Big Picture, Williams Aff. \u00b6\u00b6 8-9, the total distributions to the Tribe under the Note are limited. Consequently, although it might be true in theory that \"any reduction in [Big Picture]'s revenue that could result from an adverse judgment against it would therefore reduce the Tribe's income,\"\n   <em>\n    Breakthrough Mgmt.\n   </em>\n   ,\n   <extracted-citation case-ids=\"4078435\" index=\"167\" url=\"https://cite.case.law/f3d/629/1173/#p1183\">\n    629 F.3d at 1195\n   </extracted-citation>\n   , the actual effect on the Tribe appears to be insubstantial. Second, Big Picture's revenue does not play as important a role in the Tribe's general fund as in other cases where this factor supported immunity.\n   <em>\n    See\n   </em>\n   <em>\n    Breakthrough Mgmt.\n   </em>\n   ,\n   <extracted-citation case-ids=\"4078435\" index=\"168\" url=\"https://cite.case.law/f3d/629/1173/#p1183\">\n    629 F.3d at 1195\n   </extracted-citation>\n   (tribe \"depend[ed] heavily on the [entity]\" for funding);\n   <em>\n    Everette\n   </em>\n   ,\n   <extracted-citation case-ids=\"4265423\" index=\"169\" url=\"https://cite.case.law/f-supp-3d/146/720/#p723\">\n    146 F.Supp.3d at 724\n   </extracted-citation>\n   . As noted, Big Picture has not provided an exact breakdown of revenue allocation to different tribal services, so it is impossible to discern how the Tribe would be affected, if at all, if a judgment harmed Big Picture's operations. Third, there is evidence that Big Picture\n   does not comply with its operating agreement's mandatory cash distribution requirement when balances exceed $500.\n   <em>\n    See, e.g.\n   </em>\n   , ECF No. 83-24 at MARTORELLO_000218;\n   <em>\n    see also\n   </em>\n   Big Picture Operating Agmt' \u00a7 6.2. If Big Picture does not transfer its funds to TED when it should, then the Tribe likely does not need that money on a timely basis. Given these circumstances, this factor weighs against Big Picture.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-129\">\n   Ascension's financial relationship with the Tribe is not very different. By its own admission, Ascension does not generate revenue for itself or for the Tribe, so a judgment against Ascension could not possibly affect the Tribe's revenue directly. However, given that Ascension performs critical services for Big Picture, any judgment that limited Ascension's operations or forced it to close would, by extension, drastically reduce Big Picture's revenue. This potential indirect effect on the Tribe's general fund is important in the financial relationship framework.\n   <em>\n    See\n   </em>\n   <em>\n    Breakthrough Mgmt.\n   </em>\n   ,\n   <extracted-citation case-ids=\"4078435\" index=\"170\" url=\"https://cite.case.law/f3d/629/1173/#p1183\">\n    629 F.3d at\n   </extracted-citation>\n   1195 ;\n   <em>\n    Miami Nation\n   </em>\n   ,\n   <extracted-citation case-ids=\"12513359\" index=\"171\" url=\"https://cite.case.law/cal-rptr-3d/211/837/\">\n    211 Cal.Rptr.3d 837\n   </extracted-citation>\n   ,\n   <extracted-citation case-ids=\"12513359\" index=\"172\" url=\"https://cite.case.law/cal-rptr-3d/211/837/\">\n    386 P.3d at 373\n   </extracted-citation>\n   .

As noted, more than 10% of the Tribe's general fund comes from Big Picture's revenue, and that percentage will increase to more than 30% in the next few years. In addition, Hazen has stated that those funds \"are used to provide a variety of social services and other benefits for the Tribe.\"\n   <em>\n    Howard\n   </em>\n   ,\n   <extracted-citation index=\"178\" url=\"https://cite.case.law/citations/?q=2017%20WL%203669565\">\n    2017 WL 3669565\n   </extracted-citation>\n   , at *4. Even though Ascension does not make any money itself, it necessarily contributes to Big Picture's revenues by providing crucial technical and marketing services. As a result, both entities seem to \"promote and fund the Tribe's self-determination through revenue generation and the funding of diversified economic development.\"\n   <em>\n    Breakthrough Mgmt.\n   </em>\n   ,\n   <extracted-citation case-ids=\"4078435\" index=\"179\" url=\"https://cite.case.law/f3d/629/1173/#p1183\">\n    629 F.3d at\n   </extracted-citation>\n   1195 ;\n   <em>\n    see also\n   </em>\n   <em>\n    Everette\n   </em>\n   ,\n   <extracted-citation case-ids=\"4265423\" index=\"180\" url=\"https://cite.case.law/f-supp-3d/146/720/#p723\">\n    146 F.Supp.3d at 725\n   </extracted-citation>\n   .\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-133\">\n   However, a closer look reveals that neither Big Picture nor Ascension fulfills those goals very well, if at all. The inadequacies of Hazen's general statements about the Tribe's use of Big Picture's revenues are detailed above. Because the extent to which the Tribe has actually used Big Picture's funds for the services noted by Hazen is unclear, the Court cannot tell whether granting immunity here \"directly protects the ... Tribe's treasury, which is one of the historic purposes of sovereign immunity in general.\"\n   <em>\n    Allen\n   </em>\n   ,\n   <extracted-citation case-ids=\"3729267,7349141\" index=\"181\" url=\"https://cite.case.law/f3d/464/1044/\">\n    464 F.3d at 1047\n   </extracted-citation>\n   . Moreover, even assuming that Big\n   Picture's lending operation and Ascension's support have contributed to the Tribe's economic self-development to some extent, those entities' actions have primarily enriched non-tribal entities like Eventide and, possibly, individuals like Martorello. The Bellicose purchase, and the resulting Note and Loan Agreement, have undoubtedly yielded some benefits for the Tribe. Yet, by limiting the Tribe's monthly distribution to a very small percentage of Big Picture's revenue, the Note forces the Tribe to receive those benefits at substantial cost-a reality that is illustrated by the sharp disparity in distributions received by the Tribe and Eventide since TED began repaying the loan. Consequently, as Plaintiffs note, granting immunity here might have the unintended consequence of preventing the Tribe from obtaining favorable terms in future business transactions, as non-tribal entities would not be inclined to offer repayment above a certain rate. Thus, even if the Tribe is not bound by the Note's distribution structure forever, the example will have been set. Therefore, although Big Picture and Ascension serve the core purposes of tribal immunity to some extent, these circumstances cause this factor to weigh against immunity for both entities.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-134\">\n   <strong>\n    C. Weight of Factors\n   </strong>\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-135\">\n   For the reasons discussed above, Big Picture and Ascension have the burden to prove arm-of-the-tribe immunity by a preponderance of the evidence. That means the weighing of factors must permit a finding of immunity. On this record, that balance actually falls the other way, and weighing everything on the balance, the Court finds that neither entity qualifies as an arm of the Tribe. Therefore, Big Picture and Ascension are not immune from suit here.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-136\">\n   <strong>\n    CONCLUSION\n   </strong>\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-137\">\n   For the foregoing reasons, DEFENDANTS BIG PICTURE LOANS AND ASCENSION TECHNOLOGIES' MOTION TO DISMISS FOR LACK OF SUBJECT MATTER JURISDICTION (ECF No. 22) was denied.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-138\">\n   It is so ORDERED.\n  </p>\n  <footnote label=\"2\">\n   <p id=\"p-142\">\n    Plaintiffs allege that the TFSRA's powers with regard to a hearing are constrained by TFSRA Regulation 1.1.
