CRENSHAW, JR., CHIEF UNITED STATES DISTRICT JUDGE\n  </author>\n  <p id=\"p-9\">\n   Pending before the Court are Plaintiff's Motion for Summary Judgment (Doc. No. 43), Defendant Vessels' Motion for Summary Judgment (Doc. No. 48), and Defendant SP Plus Corporation's Motion for Summary Judgment (Doc. No. 51).\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-10\">\n   BACKGROUND\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-11\">\n   Krista Billiter is a former employee of SP Plus Corporation (\"SP Plus\"). Michael R. Vessels is also a former employee of SP Plus and was a co-worker of Billiter's.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-12\">\n   Billiter alleges that, while she was employed with SP Plus, SP Plus provided her with a company laptop computer. She claims that she used the company laptop not only for work, but also on occasion for access to her personal email and accounts. She complains that Vessels downloaded and removed her personal files from her private electronic devices without her knowledge and consent.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-13\">\n   The Amended Complaint (Doc. No. 21) asserts that Billiter left SP Plus on or about October 15, 2015, but she admitted in response to SP Plus' Statement of Undisputed Facts that her employment ended on August 27, 2015 (Doc. No. 59 at \u00b6 2). In the Amended Complaint, Billiter claims that she was required to return her laptop to SP Plus, but she was not allowed to remove personal files and information from it. In response to Defendant Vessels' Statement of Undisputed Facts, however, Billiter admitted that, prior to returning her laptop to SP Plus, she erased her \"side of the account,\" \"returning it to its original form before turning it back in.\" (Doc. No. 60 at \u00b6 38; Doc. No. 48-1 at 19 (Dep. at 70) ).\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-14\">\n   Billiter avers that Defendant Vessels knowingly, intentionally, inappropriately, and without authorization accessed her private electronic accounts, including private information, photographs and videos. She further alleges that Vessels accessed this information in the course and scope of his employment with SP Plus, with SP Plus resources, through SP Plus access, and with SP Plus' knowledge. She believes that Vessels knowingly, inappropriately, and without authorization shared this private information, including her nude photos and videos, with other employees of SP Plus.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-15\">\n   The Amended Complaint alleges that Defendants are responsible for negligent infliction of emotional distress, intentional infliction of emotional distress, violation of Tennessee's Wire Tapping and Electronic Surveillance Act, violation of the Federal Stored Communications Act, and invasion of her privacy, and that SP Plus was negligent in its hiring, supervision and retention of Vessels and is vicariously liable for Vessels' actions. All parties have filed Motions for Summary Judgment. Plaintiff has conceded that her negligent infliction of emotional distress claim should be dismissed, and both Defendants' Motions for Summary Judgment on that issue will be granted.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-16\">\n   SUMMARY JUDGMENT\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-17\">\n   Summary judgment is appropriate where there is no genuine issue as to any material fact and the movant is entitled to judgment as a matter of law.

The party bringing the summary judgment motion has the initial burden of informing the Court of the basis for its motion and identifying portions of the record that demonstrate the absence of a genuine dispute over material facts.\n   <em>\n    Rodgers v. Banks\n   </em>\n   ,\n   <extracted-citation case-ids=\"781033\" index=\"1\" url=\"https://cite.case.law/f3d/344/587/#p595\">\n    344 F.3d 587\n   </extracted-citation>\n   , 595 (6th Cir. 2003). The moving party may satisfy this burden by presenting affirmative evidence that negates an element of the non-moving party's claim or by demonstrating an absence of evidence to support the nonmoving party's case.\n   <em>\n    <extracted-citation case-ids=\"781033\" index=\"2\" url=\"https://cite.case.law/f3d/344/587/#p595\">\n     Id\n    </extracted-citation>\n   </em>\n   <extracted-citation case-ids=\"781033\" index=\"2\" url=\"https://cite.case.law/f3d/344/587/#p595\">\n    .\n   </extracted-citation>\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-18\">\n   In deciding a motion for summary judgment, the Court must review all the evidence, facts and inferences in the light most favorable to the nonmoving party.\n   <em>\n    Van Gorder v.

No. 64, \u00b6\u00b6 33 and 38). Billiter contends that Vessels took out the SP Plus hard drive in his own laptop and replaced it with a personal hard drive; erased or tried to erase information on his laptop before returning it to SP Plus; and lost or hid the original SP Plus hard drive from his computer. Billiter further alleges that SP Plus, after receiving a letter from Billiter's counsel that requested that all information and data be preserved and that Billiter's allegations immediately be investigated, did not investigate and did not preserve relevant evidence. She contends that SP Plus did not lock Vessels' access to his laptop when he was placed on administrative leave, did not send someone with Vessels to be sure he did not erase or destroy information when retrieving his laptop, and did not attempt to find the original SP Plus hard drive from Vessels' laptop.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-21\">\n   Billiter maintains that destruction of this key evidence occurred after Defendants knew, or should have known, about the allegations of her complaint. She contends that Defendants' failure to take reasonable steps to preserve these key pieces of evidence has significantly prejudiced her ability to prove her causes of action. Billiter asserts that her own laptop, Vessels' laptop, and both hard drives from Vessel's computer are primary sources for proving that Vessel did (or did not) access and retrieve information from Billiter's electronic devices. She asks the Court to sanction both Vessels and SP Plus for this missing evidence by granting summary judgment in her favor.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-22\">\n   Courts in the Sixth Circuit apply federal law in determining whether spoliation sanctions are appropriate.\n   <em>\n    Beaven v. United States Dep't of Justice\n   </em>\n   ,\n   <extracted-citation case-ids=\"3786414\" index=\"9\" url=\"https://cite.case.law/f3d/622/540/#p553\">\n    622 F.3d 540\n   </extracted-citation>\n   , 553 (6th Cir. 2010). Rule 37(e) of the Federal Rules of Civil Procedure provides that if electronically stored information that should have been preserved in the anticipation or conduct of litigation is lost because a party failed to take reasonable steps to preserve it, and it cannot be restored or replaced through additional discovery, the court, upon finding prejudice to another party from loss of the information, may order measures no greater than necessary to cure the prejudice. Fed. R. Civ. P. 37(e)(1). If the court finds that the party acted with the intent to deprive another party of the information's use in the litigation, it may (1) presume that the lost information was unfavorable to the party; (2) instruct the jury that it may or must presume the information was unfavorable to the party; or (3) dismiss the action or enter a default judgment. Fed. R. Civ. P. 37(e)(2).\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-23\">\n   Spoliation is the destruction or significant alteration of evidence, or the failure to preserve property for another's\n   use as evidence in pending or reasonably foreseeable litigation.\n   <em>\n    Clark Constr.

A party seeking a spoliation sanction because evidence was destroyed must establish that (1) the party having control over the evidence had an obligation to preserve it at the time it was destroyed; (2) the evidence was destroyed with a culpable state of mind; and (3) the destroyed evidence was relevant to the party's claim or defense such that a reasonable trier of fact could find that it would support that claim or defense.\n   <em>\n    <extracted-citation index=\"14\" url=\"https://cite.case.law/citations/?q=2018%20WL%201887418\">\n     Id\n    </extracted-citation>\n   </em>\n   <extracted-citation index=\"14\" url=\"https://cite.case.law/citations/?q=2018%20WL%201887418\">\n    .\n   </extracted-citation>\n   (citing\n   <em>\n    Yoder &amp; Frey Auctioneers, Inc. v.

Before determining if sanctions are appropriate, the Court must first determine the trigger date when a party was on notice to safeguard the evidence; that is, when the obligation to preserve evidence arose.\n   <em>\n    Clark\n   </em>\n   ,\n   <extracted-citation case-ids=\"616363\" index=\"19\" url=\"https://cite.case.law/frd/229/131/#p136\">\n    229 F.R.D. at 136\n   </extracted-citation>\n   . In this case, there are issues of fact as to when that triggering date was for each Defendant.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-26\">\n   For example, John Giles, an SP Plus employee, testified that his supervisor, Marcus Marasco,\n   <footnotemark>\n    2\n   </footnotemark>\n   was part of a conversation in which Vessels talked about accessing nude pictures of Billiter, and that conversation occurred about six months before Giles actually saw the pictures. (Doc. No. 45-2 at 100-103). He stated that he saw the pictures in March of 2016,\n   <footnotemark>\n    3\n   </footnotemark>\n   so the conversation would have been around September of 2015 (\n   <em>\n    Id\n   </em>\n   . at 102). Vessels, on the other hand, stated that he told Marasco about accessing Billiter's unsecure Dropbox account and the nude photos sometime prior to July 2015. (\n   <em>\n    Id\n   </em>\n   . at \u00b6\u00b6 16-19 and Doc. No. 45-3 at 160, 162). SP Plus claims that the conversation in which Vessels mentioned nude photographs of Billiter occurred sometime in March of 2016. (Doc. No. 67 at \u00b6 16). Thus, there is a basis to find that an SP Plus supervisor knew, in September of 2015, or before July 2015, or in March of 2016, that Vessels was claiming to have taken private information from Billiter's computer.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-27\">\n   Marasco testified that Vessels openly discussed his access to Billiter's unsecured Dropbox account and the nude pictures. (Doc. No. 45-5 at 56-57). Marasco testified that he overheard this conversation and he thought the conversation occurred after Billiter had left SP Plus (\n   <em>\n    Id\n   </em>\n   . at 59), but then he stated that he did not know if it happened prior to July of 2015. (\n   <em>\n    Id\n   </em>\n   . at 63). Marasco further testified that, in June of\n   2016, he heard, from a former employee named Julius, about an issue related to Vessels' accessing Billiter's laptop and copying her files. (Doc. No. 45-5 at 71, 73). Marasco then testified that this information from Julius was the first time he had heard such an assertion about Vessels (\n   <em>\n    Id\n   </em>\n   . at 73). It is for the jury to determine what parts, if any, of Marasco's story should be believed and how much weight, if any, it deserves.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-28\">\n   SP Plus interviewed Marasco on June 7, 2016, concerning the allegations in the Complaint and the report from Julius (Doc. No. 67 at \u00b6 65). On June 8, 2016, Marasco reported to the Vice President of Human Resources that Vessels had openly discussed that Billiter had an unsecured Dropbox account that included nude pictures (Doc. No. 67 at \u00b6 66).\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-29\">\n   Billiter contends that SP Plus knew or should have known that the ultimately destroyed evidence would be relevant to possible future litigation as early as June or July 2015, when Vessels told his supervisor (Marasco) about accessing the nude photos in Billiter's accounts. Billiter argues that, at least by March of 2016, SP Plus knew or should have known that the ultimately destroyed evidence could be relevant to future litigation when Vessels showed the nude photos to other employees, including Giles. Billiter also avers that SP Plus was on notice of this pending litigation when it received counsel's April 12 and April 28, 2016 letters\n   <footnotemark>\n    4\n   </footnotemark>\n   asking it to preserve all data and information and to immediately investigate the situation. Billiter contends that SP Plus was again put on notice when she filed her Complaint in this action on May 19, 2016. Finally, Billiter argues that Julius' communication with Marasco again put SP Plus on notice in June of 2016. Despite all this notice, Billiter argues, even when its investigation began, SP Plus took no action to preserve data and information in the control of its employee, Vessels, who was alleged to have illegally and inappropriately used his SP Plus laptop, system and/or access to obtain Billiter's personal information and photos. There is no evidence before the Court that,\n   <em>\n    to this day\n   </em>\n   , SP Plus has done anything to preserve Vessels' hard drives.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-30\">\n   Even knowing that Vessels had attempted to erase one hard drive, SP Plus did nothing in response to that fact to retrieve that information or locate the other hard drive. Vessels' supervisor testified that SP Plus did not ask Vessels where the original SP Plus hard drive he removed could be found. (\n   <em>\n    Id\n   </em>\n   . at \u00b6 79). Moreover, there has been no investigation or effort to locate or recover the original SP Plus hard drive that Vessels removed from his work laptop. (\n   <em>\n    Id\n   </em>\n   . at \u00b6 82).\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-31\">\n   In June of 2016, SP Plus suspended Vessels while it conducted its investigation concerning Billiter's photos (Doc. No. 64 at \u00b6 72). On June 22, 2016, SP Plus officials told Vessels that he needed to hand over his work laptop to be sent away for investigation, but he did not have his laptop with him at work; instead, it was at home. (\n   <em>\n    Id\n   </em>\n   . at \u00b6 73). Vessels was allowed to leave SP Plus to go, alone, to retrieve his work laptop from home. (\n   <em>\n    Id\n   </em>\n   . at \u00b6\u00b6 75-76). Vessels' supervisor testified that, while Vessels was at home retrieving his laptop, Vessels turned on the laptop and conducted a search for ways to erase data on the hard drive. (\n   <em>\n    Id\n   </em>\n   . at \u00b6 77). It is undisputed that Vessels took out the SP Plus hard drive and put in one of his own personal\n   hard drives after this lawsuit was filed (\n   <em>\n    Id\n   </em>\n   . at \u00b6\u00b6 61-62).\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-32\">\n   Defendants do not dispute that Vessels was officially terminated by SP Plus on June 29, 2016, for two reasons: (1) the forensic report on his laptop showed he had attempted to delete and wipe his computer, which SP Plus determined to be interference with an active investigation; and (2) for accessing inappropriate websites on his work computer. (Doc. No. 64 at \u00b6 108 and Doc. No. 67 at \u00b6 108). When Vessels and SP Plus knew or should have known they had a duty to preserve this evidence involves credibility determinations and factual issues.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-33\">\n   There are genuine issues of fact as to whether Vessels and SP Plus destroyed this evidence with a culpable state of mind. The requisite culpable state of mind may be established through a showing that the evidence was destroyed knowingly, even if without intent to breach a duty to preserve it.\n   <em>\n    Stevenson\n   </em>\n   ,\n   <extracted-citation index=\"20\" url=\"https://cite.case.law/citations/?q=2018%20WL%201887418\">\n    2018 WL 1887418\n   </extracted-citation>\n   at *5. If Defendants knew this evidence was relevant to potential litigation and destroyed the evidence anyway, then a jury could find that such destruction was deliberate. There is evidence that Vessels erased one hard drive and failed to return another hard drive after he learned about the investigation. It would not be unreasonable for a jury to find that Vessels intentionally destroyed this evidence and that SP Plus did nothing to stop him, so there is a basis upon which to conclude that this evidence was destroyed or lost with a culpable state of mind. At the very least, there are factual questions as to this issue.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-34\">\n   Finally, it is obvious that the missing evidence is relevant to Billiter's claims. This evidence is the heart of Billiter's claim. She alleges that Vessels copied information from her work laptop (which was destroyed) onto Vessels' work laptop. Vessels' SP Plus hard drive is missing, and Vessels' personal hard drive has allegedly been erased, meaning that Billiter never had a chance to examine them or have experts examine them to determine whether Vessels had accessed, uploaded or copied her personal information onto either hard drive. To prove her claim, Billiter needed to be able to evaluate and test her laptop and Vessels' hard drives. Even SP Plus agreed that Vessels' efforts to delete or erase files on his hard drive interfered with SP Plus' own investigation. (Doc. No. 67 at \u00b6 105). Billiter's ability to prove how Vessels may have obtained access, and whether he in fact did so, is seriously prejudiced by the loss of this evidence.\n   <footnotemark>\n    5\n   </footnotemark>\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-35\">\n   Defendant SP Plus contends that Billiter's request for sanctions is untimely because she has known about this missing evidence for many months. It also boldly contends that it had no duty to preserve Billiter's laptop or Vessels' original hard drive and that any data on Vessels' personal hard drive would have been irrelevant. The Court finds that Billiter's request for sanctions in her Motion for Summary Judgment is not untimely. As noted, there is no longer a separate Motion for Sanctions pending. Billiter filed the pending motion after deposing the SP Plus corporate witnesses and exploring these issues of spoliation with them. In addition, when the duty to preserve arose presents issues of fact, and the missing information could certainly be relevant.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-36\">\n   Defendant Vessels argues that Billiter has not demonstrated that the information she seeks cannot be restored or replaced through additional discovery. He also asserts that, even assuming he did spoil evidence, harsh sanctions are not warranted under these circumstances because he did not spoil evidence with an intent to deprive Billiter of information related to this lawsuit. The Court is unsure to what additional discovery Vessels refers, but there are still material issues of fact concerning this issue.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-37\">\n   Because of all the factual issues, the Court cannot determine whether a sanction is appropriate at this time, except to say that it will not grant summary judgment for Billiter. The Court need not decide at this juncture what type of adverse inference jury instruction is warranted. For purposes of summary judgment, it suffices to say that Billiter has a colorable claim to an adverse inference instruction at trial.\n   <em>\n    See\n   </em>\n   <em>\n    Jones v.

His citation for this assertion, Statement of Facts \u00b6 20, does not support this contention. First of all, Statement of Facts \u00b6 20 in Vessels' Statement of Undisputed Facts (Doc.

SP Plus argues that Billiter has no evidence that SP Plus equipment was used, but the reason Billiter has no evidence is because the relevant evidence was destroyed.

There are questions of fact about whether Vessels was on his employer's business at the time(s) of his alleged misconduct. Billiter alleges that Vessels accessed her computer using SP Plus equipment because he was authorized by SP Plus to access other computers as part of his job. She contends that Vessels decided which laptop she received and, therefore, could have made it even more accessible for himself. Billiter asserts that when she returned her laptop to SP Plus, it again went to Vessels, who had it destroyed. SP Plus argues that any attempt to copy or upload nude photos from Vessels' computer would clearly be a deviation from SP Plus' business. As noted above, however, this doctrine requires the weighing and balancing of the facts and circumstances of each case, and the Court cannot weigh and balance the evidence on this motion.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-78\">\n   SP Plus contends that Billiter cannot prove that Vessels used his work laptop to access her work laptop or other personal devices.

Working with computers, making decisions about computers, assisting others, sometimes through remote access - all these things have been alleged to be a part of Vessels' job. Some of this misconduct admittedly occurred at work, including Vessels' bragging about having access to Billiter's nude photos and then actually showing those photos to at least one co-worker. Vessels' supervisor, Marasco, gained notice about these photos while at work. Whether Vessels' behavior was actuated, at least in part, by a purpose to serve his employer is more difficult; but for purposes of this motion, the Court finds there are genuine issues of material fact precluding summary judgment\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-81\">\n   Accordingly, SP Plus' Motion for Summary Judgment on the issue of\n   <em>\n    respondeat superior\n   </em>\n   and vicarious liability will be denied.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-82\">\n   F.\n   <em>\n    Negligent Hiring, Supervision and Retention\n   </em>\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-83\">\n   Billiter alleges that SP Plus was negligent in its hiring, supervision and retention of Vessels as an employee. Under Tennessee law, this claim may be maintained by establishing the elements of a negligence claim, plus evidence that the employer had knowledge of the employee's unfitness for the job.\n   <em>\n    Brown v. Bd. of Educ. of Shelby Cty. Schools\n   </em>\n   ,\n   <extracted-citation case-ids=\"5739499\" index=\"57\" url=\"https://cite.case.law/f-supp-3d/47/665/#p685\">\n    47 F.Supp.3d 665\n   </extracted-citation>\n   , 685 (W.D. Tenn. 2014). A negligence claim requires proof of a duty of care owed to the plaintiff, breach of that duty by the defendant, injury or loss, actual causation, and proximate causation.\n   <em>\n    <extracted-citation case-ids=\"5739499\" index=\"58\" url=\"https://cite.case.law/f-supp-3d/47/665/#p685\">\n     Id\n    </extracted-citation>\n   </em>\n   <extracted-citation case-ids=\"5739499\" index=\"58\" url=\"https://cite.case.law/f-supp-3d/47/665/#p685\">\n    .\n   </extracted-citation>\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-84\">\n   Billiter has presented no evidence that SP Plus knew or should have known, when hiring Vessels, that he was \"unfit\" for the job or that he would invade the privacy of other employees in the ways Billiter has alleged. There is no support for alleging that SP Plus could foresee, when hiring Vessels, that he might access nude photos of a co-worker and disclose them to others. SP Plus is entitled to summary judgment on the negligent hiring claim.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-85\">\n   With negligent supervision and retention, the question is harder, because Vessels' supervisor allegedly knew, at some disputed point in time, that Vessels was bragging about accessing nude photos of Billiter and that Vessels was showing those photos to co-workers. Whether those alleged facts actually occurred and, if so, when they occurred are disputed. Whether Marasco, as Vessels' supervisor, should have done something after he found out about the nude photos is a question for the jury. Whether and when Marasco knew or should have known that Vessels' behavior should be investigated and that Vessels should be fired are other questions of fact. The Court cannot grant summary judgment on the negligent supervision and retention claims because of these factual disputes, and SP Plus' Motion for Summary Judgment on these issues will be denied.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-86\">\n   G.\n   <em>\n    Conclusion\n   </em>\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-87\">\n   SP Plus' Motion for Summary Judgment will be granted in part and denied in part. Billiter's claims for violation of the Tennessee Wiretapping Act, for negligent and intentional infliction of emotional distress, and for negligent hiring against SP Plus will be dismissed.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-88\">\n   CONCLUSION\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-89\">\n   For all these reasons, Plaintiff's Motion for Summary Judgment (Doc. No. 43) will be denied; Defendant Vessels' Motion for Summary Judgment (Doc. No. 48) will be granted in part and denied in part; and Defendant SP Plus Corporation's Motion for Summary Judgment (Doc. No. 51) will be granted in part and denied in part.\n  </p>\n  <footnote label=\"1\">\n   <p id=\"p-92\">\n    Billiter filed a separate Motion for Sanctions (Doc.

The missing evidence would very likely have provided that evidence, one way or the other.\n   </p>\n  </footnote>\n  <footnote label=\"6\">\n   <p id=\"p-97\">\n    Vessels asserts that Billiter's SCA claim is limited to allegations that he improperly accessed her Dropbox account, citing \"Statement of Undisputed Facts \u00b6 34.\" Billiter's response to Vessels' Statement of Undisputed Facts, \u00b6 34, does not contain such an admission (Doc. No. 60 at \u00b6 34). If, in fact, Vessels is referring to the response to his Statement of Fact \u00b6 30, Billiter denied that fact as written. (Doc.
