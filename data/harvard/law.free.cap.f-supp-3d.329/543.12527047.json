These consolidated cases were brought on behalf of two teenagers, the victims of hazing and sexual assault at their former high school. While on a school basketball trip, John Doe and Richard Roe, Jr.'s teammates held them down and sexually attacked them with a pool cue. Doe's attack was particularly gruesome because it resulted in him being anally penetrated with the narrow end of a pool cue, leaving him seriously injured. Doe's and Roe's parents, on behalf of their sons, brought claims against the Hamilton County Department of Education, some of its school administrators, and one of its teachers asserting Title IX,\n   <extracted-citation index=\"0\" url=\"https://cite.case.law/citations/?q=42%20U.S.C.%20%C2%A7%201983\">\n    42 U.S.C. \u00a7 1983\n   </extracted-citation>\n   , and state law tort claims. Plaintiffs allege, in sum, that Defendants were deliberately indifferent to Doe's and Roe's harassment in violation of their statutory and constitutional rights, and further that the school system and its agents were negligent.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-11\">\n   Because the Court finds factual questions permeate Doe's and Roe's sexual assault, the Plaintiffs' Motion for Partial Summary Judgment [Doc. 178] is\n   <strong>\n    DENIED\n   </strong>\n   . Although those questions create a triable issue as to pre-assault deliberate indifference, after the assaults the Hamilton County Department of Education acted reasonably in its response by promptly punishing Doe and Roe's attackers and investigating the incidents. Further, the Court finds there are genuine issues of fact regarding whether the Department was constitutionally deficient in its relevant staff training. Accordingly, Hamilton County Department of Education's Motion for Summary Judgment [Doc. 177] will be\n   <strong>\n    GRANTED in part and DENIED in part\n   </strong>\n   . Likewise, there is insufficient evidence demonstrating the individual defendants in this action violated constitutional rights, and all are otherwise protected by qualified immunity. As such, Andre Montgomery, James Jarvis, and Jesse Nayadley's Motions for Summary Judgment [Docs. 172, &amp; 176] are hereby\n   <strong>\n    GRANTED\n   </strong>\n   .\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-12\">\n   <strong>\n    I. BACKGROUND\n   </strong>\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-13\">\n   In 2015, John Doe (\"Doe\") and Richard Roe, Jr. (\"Roe\"), were freshmen at Ooltewah High School (\"OHS\"), a school administered by the Hamilton County Department of Education (the \"Department\"). There Doe and Roe participated in the school's basketball program. Most freshmen that aspired to play basketball at OHS were resigned to play on the school's freshman squad, but Doe's and Roe's skill earned them a spot on the varsity team. [Doc. 185 at 1]. What at first appeared to be an honor soon turned out to be a source of torment.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-14\">\n   The OHS varsity team was allegedly rife with bullying and hazing. [Doc. 185 at 4, &amp;\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-15\">\n   186 at 5]. One favored form of hazing was what the players referred to as \"racking-in\" or the \"rackings.\" [Doc. 179 at 2-3] Rackings consisted of upperclassmen beating freshman players in the team locker room with the lights out. [Doc. 185 at 3]. Three upperclassmen in particular were prominent \"rackers,\" Students A, B, and C. [Doc. 185 at 2]. The three actually started the rackings once they joined the basketball team later that year, in November. [\n   <em>\n    Id.\n   </em>\n   ]. All four of the team's freshman players-Doe, Roe, and Students F and H-fell victim to the rack. [Doc. 185 at 3]. The frequency of rackings would vary per player; Doe says he was racked-in only once, but Roe claims he was put through the freshman rack multiple times per week. [Doc. 179 at 2]. Neither Doe nor Roe ever reported the rackings to school officials. [Doc. 173 at 5].\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-16\">\n   The varsity team's coach was Andre Montgomery (\"Montgomery\"), a defendant in this action. [Doc. 177-1 at 2]. Montgomery was also a teacher at OHS, and he had coached basketball at the school in some capacity since 2009. [Doc. 185 at 2]. Montgomery's office was next door to the team's locker room, and on more than one occasion he entered the locker room to find the players inside with the lights off. [\n   <em>\n    Id.\n   </em>\n   at 4-5]. His typical response consisted of him turning on the lights and yelling \"knock off the horseplay.\" [\n   <em>\n    Id.\n   </em>\n   at 5]. Montgomery also occasionally punished players for hazing or horseplay. [\n   <em>\n    Id.\n   </em>\n   ]. Plaintiffs assert this is evidence Montgomery knew of the rackings. [\n   <em>\n    Id.\n   </em>\n   at 4]. Montgomery denies he had any such knowledge. [Doc. 173 at 4].\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-17\">\n   <strong>\n    A. The Gatlinburg Trip\n   </strong>\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-18\">\n   On December 19, 2015, the varsity team and Coach Montgomery traveled to the Gatlinburg, Tennessee area to participate in the \"Smokey Mountains Christmas Classic\" basketball tournament. [\n   <em>\n    Id.\n   </em>\n   at 3]. The trip was scheduled to last five days, with at least four overnight stays in Gatlinburg. [\n   <em>\n    Id.\n   </em>\n   ]. The team's fourteen players, Montgomery, his wife, his daughter, and an Assistant Coach, Karl Williams, would all stay in a single cabin, \"JJ's Hideaway.\" [\n   <em>\n    Id.\n   </em>\n   ]. The cabin had two floors. [Doc. 185 at 5]. The boys were divided into three rooms in a downstairs area, and the adults and Montgomery's daughter stayed in two rooms upstairs. [\n   <em>\n    Id.\n   </em>\n   ]. When downstairs, the players were secluded from the adults, which effectively left them unsupervised. [\n   <em>\n    See e.g.\n    <extracted-citation index=\"1\" url=\"https://cite.case.law/citations/?q=42%20U.S.C.%20%C2%A7%201983\">\n     id.\n    </extracted-citation>\n   </em>\n   <extracted-citation index=\"1\" url=\"https://cite.case.law/citations/?q=42%20U.S.C.%20%C2%A7%201983\">\n    at 6\n   </extracted-citation>\n   ]. Montgomery and Williams ventured down \"only once or twice\" during the entire trip. [\n   <em>\n    Id.\n   </em>\n   ] However, Montgomery claimed he could hear the players downstairs, including their conversations. [Doc. 185 at 7]. The downstairs area had a den that featured a billiards table. [\n   <em>\n    Id.\n   </em>\n   at 6]. Prior to and early on in the trip, Student B hinted to the freshmen that \"something\" was going to happen during the trip, and the upperclassmen would talk and joke about using pool cues on the freshmen, although at first Doe believed it was their intention to merely beat the freshman with the cues. [\n   <em>\n    See\n   </em>\n   Docs. 177-1 at 3, &amp; 179 at 4]. Doe actually attempted to hide the pool cues to prevent their use. [Doc. 179 at 4]. Doe's efforts ultimately failed, however, and before the trip's end Students A, B, and C would use those pool cues to sexually assault the team's four freshmen.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-19\">\n   Montgomery and Williams' laissez-faire approach to supervision is evidenced by their actions upon arriving at the cabin on December 19th. The two decided to go grocery shopping, leaving the players unsupervised for almost two hours. [Doc. 185 at 6]. The scene quickly devolved into a proverbial\n   <em>\n    Lord of the Flies\n   </em>\n   situation. [Doc. 179]. Once the adults left, upperclassmen shut off the cabin lights. [Doc. 185 at 6]. The freshmen scattered. Doe,\n   Roe, and another freshman sought shelter in a locked bathroom, where upperclassmen soon broke in, beat up the screaming freshmen, and drug them out. [Doc. 177-1 at 5]. Bands of upperclassmen then rounded up and threw fully clothed freshmen into the cabin's outdoor hot tub, on that cold December night. [Doc. 185 at 7]. Doe and Roe were among the victims. [\n   <em>\n    Id.\n   </em>\n   ].\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-20\">\n   The next night, December 20, 2015, the trip took an even darker turn. Upperclassmen found the hidden pool cues. Students A and C soon grabbed one of the team's freshman, Student F, and pinned him to the ground [Doc. 185 at 7]. While the two held him down, Student B took a pool cue and used it to prod Student F's anus, over his clothes. [\n   <em>\n    Id.\n   </em>\n   ]. Throughout the attack, Student F screamed. [\n   <em>\n    Id.\n   </em>\n   ]. Soon thereafter, Student A hunted down and grabbed Roe, wrestled him to the ground, and sat on his back to prevent his escape. [\n   <em>\n    Id.\n   </em>\n   ]. Then Student B, like he had done with Student F, placed a pool cue over Roe's clothes, between his buttocks, and \"attempted to penetrate ... Roe's rectum\" with the cue. [Doc. 177-1 at 6]. While Student B was doing this he was yelling \"don't be a pussy,\" and \"take it like a man.\" [Doc. 185 at 7].\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-21\">\n   The sexual assaults continued the next night, on December 21st. [Doc. 177-1 at 6]. After playing a game of pool, Doe heard Students A and C yell, \"Get 'em\" as they grabbed another freshman, Student H. [\n   <em>\n    Id.\n   </em>\n   ]. Doe fled the room and hid at the top of the cabin stairs. [Docs. 177-1 at 6, &amp; 185 at 8]. From there Doe could hear Student H's screams as the upperclassmen used a pool cue to simulate sodomy on him as they had before. [Doc. 185 at 8].\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-22\">\n   The attacks came to a horrifying crescendo the night of December 22, 2015. That night, after dinner, Doe went downstairs to grab his cell phone. [Doc. 185 at 8]. There Students A, B, and C ambushed him. [\n   <em>\n    Id.\n   </em>\n   ]. They followed him into his room while holding a pool cue, and closed and locked the door. [\n   <em>\n    Id.\n   </em>\n   ]. Roe witnessed this while standing at the top of the stairs talking to Williams, and he reported what he was seeing. [\n   <em>\n    Id.\n   </em>\n   ]. Williams's response was \"they better not be doing anything to him.\" [\n   <em>\n    Id.\n   </em>\n   ]. In the room, Students A and C held Doe down. [Doc. 177-1 at 7]. Student B then took the pool cue and forcefully rammed it into Doe's anus. [\n   <em>\n    Id.\n   </em>\n   ]. This was done over his clothes, as it had been done in prior attacks, but this time the ramming was so forceful that the cue ripped through two layers of Doe's clothing and actually penetrated him. [Doc. 185 at 8]. His attackers then ran away. [\n   <em>\n    Id.\n   </em>\n   ] Roe could hear Doe's screams from where he was standing. [\n   <em>\n    Id.\n   </em>\n   ]. Roe and Williams then ran into the room to find Doe lying on the floor, bleeding from his anus. [\n   <em>\n    Id.\n   </em>\n   ]. Coach Montgomery and his wife were called down to the room shortly thereafter. [\n   <em>\n    Id.\n   </em>\n   ]. Although he was in pain and bleeding, Doe was able to get up and clean himself off. [\n   <em>\n    Id.\n   </em>\n   ]. Montgomery then pulled Roe, Doe, and Student F the side and told them, \"Keep this on the low,\" and \"Don't let this get out,\" referring to the incident. [\n   <em>\n    Id.\n   </em>\n   ]. Apparently, this encouraged Doe to continue on the trip as if nothing had happened. Montgomery then began questioning the upperclassmen, and Student B admitted to Montgomery that he \"had poked ... Doe 'on the bottom with a pool cue.' \" [Doc. 177-1 at 7].\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-23\">\n   Sometime later that night, Doe began urinating blood. [\n   <em>\n    Id.\n   </em>\n   at 9]. Montgomery took him to the local emergency room. [\n   <em>\n    Id.\n   </em>\n   ]. During this, a Detective and two police officers from the Gatlinburg Police Department arrived at the cabin and began investigating the incident. [Doc. 177-1 at 7]. After their investigation, Montgomery called Students A's, B's, and C's parents, suspended them from the team, and\n   had them transported back to OHS. [\n   <em>\n    Id.\n   </em>\n   ]. The Department would eventually suspend and \"zero tolerance[ ]\" Students A, B, and C from school some time thereafter. [\n   <em>\n    Id.\n   </em>\n   at 8]. The next day, the remainder of the team, including Roe, competed in the last game of the tournament before going back to Ooltewah. [\n   <em>\n    Id.\n   </em>\n   ].\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-24\">\n   Back at the hospital, doctors had diagnosed Doe with a \"full-thickness bladder injury,\" meaning the attack had perforated both his rectum and bladder. [\n   <em>\n    Id.\n   </em>\n   ]. Without surgery, Doe's injuries were life threatening. [\n   <em>\n    Id.\n   </em>\n   ]. Doe was transported by ambulance to another hospital, the University of Tennessee Medical Center in Knoxville. [Doc. 185 at 9]. There surgeons performed emergency surgery on Doe, repairing damage caused by the rape. [\n   <em>\n    Id.\n   </em>\n   ]. Doe remained hospitalized for six days, and after his release, he was bed bound. [\n   <em>\n    Id.\n   </em>\n   ]. He was unable to eat or use the bathroom, and had to re-learn to walk. [\n   <em>\n    Id.\n   </em>\n   ]. He did not fully recover until over nine months after his attack. [\n   <em>\n    Id.\n   </em>\n   at 10].\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-25\">\n   After the Gatlinburg incident, Doe never returned to OHS, choosing instead to transfer to another school. [\n   <em>\n    Id.\n   </em>\n   ]. Roe tried to continue attending OHS, but he claims the friends of his assaulters' harassed and threatened him at school. [Doc. 178-1 at 206]. Shortly after returning from Christmas break, he too decided to attend a different school. [Doc. 185 at 10].\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-26\">\n   <strong>\n    B. Procedural Posture\n   </strong>\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-27\">\n   On August 9, 2016, Doe's mother, Jane Doe (collectively the \"Does\" or \"Doe Plaintiffs\"), brought a lawsuit on behalf of her son. She asserted claims against the Department, and in their official and personal capacity: Montgomery, OHS Principal James Jarvis, and OHS Athletic Director Jesse Nayadley (collectively the \"Individual Defendants\"). [Doc. 1]. Likewise, on December 16, 2016, Roe's parents, Richard Roe, Sr., and Jane Roe (collectively the \"Roes\" or \"Roe Plaintiffs\"), brought claims against the Individual Defendants, the Department, and the Department's Title IX coordinator, Marsha Drake. [1:16-cv-497 ECF Doc. 1]. On August 3, 2017, District Judge Travis R. McDonough consolidated the Does' and Roes' cases. [Doc. 65]. On March 12, 2018, the Individual Defendants moved for summary judgment as to the Does' claims [Doc. 172] and Roes' claims [Doc. 176]. The Does and Roes both responded to the Individual Defendants' respective Motions for Summary Judgment on April 2, 2018. [Docs. 184 &amp; 186]. On April 16, 2018, the Individual Defendants replied to the Doe Plaintiffs' response [Doc. 194] and Roe Plaintiffs' response [Doc. 195]. The Department and Marsha Drake also filed a Motion for Summary Judgment on March 12, 2018. [Doc. 177]. Plaintiffs responded separately. The Roes responded to the Department and Drake's motion on April 2, 2018. [Doc. 183]. The Does likewise responded to the motion on the same day. [Doc. 185]. All Plaintiffs filed a Joint Motion for Partial Summary Judgment against the Department on March 12, 2018. [Doc. 178]. The Department and Marsha Drake responded to the Plaintiffs' motion on April 2, 2018. [Doc. 182], and Plaintiffs replied in turn on April 9, 2018 [Doc. 192]. The Court finds that the issues in this matter have been fully briefed and are ready for disposition.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-28\">\n   <strong>\n    II. STANDARD OF REVIEW\n   </strong>\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-29\">\n   Federal Rule of Civil Procedure 56 instructs the Court to grant summary judgment \"if the movant shows that there is no genuine dispute as to any material fact and the movant is entitled to judgment as a matter of law.\" Fed.

A party asserting the presence or absence of genuine issues of material fact must support its position either by \"citing to particular\n   parts of materials in the record,\" including depositions, documents, affidavits or declarations, stipulations, or other materials, or by \"showing that the materials cited do not establish the absence or presence of a genuine dispute, or that an adverse party cannot produce admissible evidence to support the fact.\" Fed.

Additionally, hazing, by its nature, is primarily motivated by team hierarchy, seniority, or class position (e.g. seniors hazing freshmen), not necessarily sex.

The Court finds these assaults create a factual inference that the team's hazing amounted to sexual harassment contemplated by Title IX, meaning it was carried out \"on the basis of\" Doe's, Roe's, and the other freshmen's sex.\n   <em>\n    See e.g.\n   </em>\n   <em>\n    Doe v.

Likewise, in an unpublished decision, issued shortly before the\n   <em>\n    Pahssen\n   </em>\n   court perceived an ambiguity in this context, a Sixth Circuit panel found that a locker room incident in which eighth grade boys forced their male basketball teammate \"to the ground, pulled his pants down and anally penetrated him with a marker\" could reasonably be considered by a jury as a \"serious incident\" of sexual harassment, and \"not just horseplay gone awry.\"\n   <em>\n    Mathis\n   </em>\n   ,\n   <extracted-citation case-ids=\"4000969\" index=\"102\" url=\"https://cite.case.law/f-appx/496/513/\">\n    496 F.

Sexual assaults are by their definition \"sexual,\" but it does not follow that those who carry out such attacks are\n   <em>\n    always\n   </em>\n   motivated by their victim's gender.

To be sure, it is sensible to assume in the overwhelming majority of sexual assault cases, the victim's gender is a motivating factor for the attacker; this is indisputably the case when the attacker is driven by sexual desire. Likely because of this, the Office of Civil Rights (OCR), the executive agency tasked with enforcing Title IX, has taken this reasonable assumption\n   one step further and held, as a\n   <em>\n    per se\n   </em>\n   rule, that all acts of \"sexual violence\" against students-which the OCR defined as a nonconsensual \"sexual acts,\" including \"rape, sexual assault, sexual battery\"-\"are forms of sexual harassment covered by Title IX.\"\n   <em>\n    See\n   </em>\n   Dear Colleague Letter from Russlynn Ali, Assistant Secretary of Education for Civil Rights (Apr. 4, 2011) available at http://www2.ed.gov/about/offices/list/ocr/letters/colleague-201104.html. OCR's determination, although not controlling here, does have some persuasive value.\n   <em>\n    See\n   </em>\n   <em>\n    Christensen v.

However, while the Court agrees that most sexual assaults are motivated by the victim's gender, a Title IX legal conclusion in this context would only be beneficial if all sexual assaults are necessarily motivated by the victim's sex, and this does not appear to be true. This case provides evidence for that proposition, and its facts are hardly unique. It is an unfortunate reality that athletic hazing, despite not being typically motivated by sexual desire, can become sexually exploitive.\n   <em>\n    See\n   </em>\n   Susan P.

It is difficult to find with certainty that such sexual assaults in hazing are carried out \"on the basis of sex.\" For instance, as is relevant here, although the upperclassmen sexually assaulted freshmen players, there is little direct evidence their actions were motivated by their victims' gender. It could be the case that, given the right circumstances, the attackers would have hazed female freshman players in a similar fashion. However, contemplating a harasser's motive inserts a difficult factual determination that must be grounded in common sense and social experience, and as a result the issue is not easily or helpfully reduced to formulaic legal conclusions. Instead, if a reasonable inference of discrimination can be drawn from the evidence, a fact finder should resolve the question.\n   <em>\n    <extracted-citation index=\"111\" url=\"https://cite.case.law/citations/?q=35%20W.%20New%20Eng.%20L.%20Rev.%20377\">\n     Id.\n    </extracted-citation>\n   </em>\n   In the context of sexual assaults in hazing, a jury could reasonably infer the attack was motivated by an undercurrent of social dynamics that has a basis in the victim's gender.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-52\">\n   Sexually exploitative hazing in male athletics\n   <em>\n    is\n   </em>\n   based on the victim's gender\n   <em>\n    if\n   </em>\n   the acts have the intended goal of \"diminish[ing]\" the victim's \"masculinity\" or male identity.

Similar to Doe, however, Roe transferred to another school following the Gatlinburg incident. [Doc. 185-6 at 11]. After his assault, Roe tried to attend OHS for a short time, and he even continued to compete on the school's varsity basketball team until the season was canceled as a result of the Gatlinburg incident. However, during this time the friends of Roe's attackers harassed Roe at school by \"calling [him] names,\" telling him his sexual assault \"wasn't that big of a deal,\" and at times threatening him. [Doc. 178-1 at 206]. Roe claimed this harassment made it difficult for him to continue attending OHS, so he decided to transfer to another school. [\n   <em>\n    Id.\n   </em>\n   ]. Roe's harassment by his attacker's friends was a form of secondary harassment that is hardly unique to this case. For example, in\n   <em>\n    Doe v. East Haven Bd. of Educ.\n   </em>\n   , a fourteen-year-old female student was allegedly raped, outside of school operations, by two male classmates.\n   <extracted-citation case-ids=\"5243203\" index=\"135\" url=\"https://cite.case.law/f-appx/200/46/#p48\">\n    200 F. App'x 46\n   </extracted-citation>\n   , 48 (2d Cir. 2006). After the allegations became public and the plaintiff returned to school, she was harassed for weeks by \"other, primarily female, students,\" which included \"verbal abuse\" such as being called: \" '[a] slut, a liar, a bitch, [and] a whore.' \"\n   <em>\n    <extracted-citation case-ids=\"5243203\" index=\"136\" url=\"https://cite.case.law/f-appx/200/46/#p48\">\n     Id.\n    </extracted-citation>\n   </em>\n   <footnotemark>\n    4\n   </footnotemark>\n   Further, she would often \"see her rapists at school.\"\n   <em>\n    <extracted-citation case-ids=\"5243203\" index=\"137\" url=\"https://cite.case.law/f-appx/200/46/#p48\">\n     Id.\n    </extracted-citation>\n   </em>\n   Because of the name calling and the presence of her rapists, the plaintiff would skip classes and otherwise spend time at school in a private, secluded room, which the school had provided her.\n   <em>\n    <extracted-citation case-ids=\"5243203\" index=\"138\" url=\"https://cite.case.law/f-appx/200/46/#p48\">\n     Id.\n    </extracted-citation>\n   </em>\n   The Second Circuit found based on those facts \"a reasonable fact-finder could conclude that [the plaintiff] was subjected to a disparately hostile educational environment\n   <em>\n    that deprived her of educational benefits and opportunities.\"\n    <extracted-citation case-ids=\"5243203\" index=\"139\" url=\"https://cite.case.law/f-appx/200/46/#p48\">\n     Id.\n    </extracted-citation>\n   </em>\n   (emphasis added). The Court finds the\n   <em>\n    East Haven\n   </em>\n   court's analysis persuasive here. Based on these facts, a reasonable fact finder could conclude Roe's post-assault\n   harassment was: causally related to his sexual assault, deprived him of educational opportunities and resources at OHS, and caused him to transfer to another school. As such, the Department's Motion for Summary Judgment [Doc. 177] on this issue is\n   <strong>\n    DENIED\n   </strong>\n   . Further, because genuine issues of material fact surround Roe's alleged deprivation, the Court finds the Plaintiffs' Motion for Partial Summary Judgment [Doc. 178] on this issue should also be\n   <strong>\n    DENIED\n   </strong>\n   .\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-59\">\n   <strong>\n    2. Actual Knowledge\n   </strong>\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-60\">\n   To prove a claim under\n   <em>\n    Davis\n   </em>\n   , a plaintiff must establish the defendant school system had actual knowledge of the plaintiff's sexual harassment. This actual knowledge requirement is an essential element of a\n   <em>\n    Davis\n   </em>\n   claim. With\n   <em>\n    Davis\n   </em>\n   , it was not the Supreme Court's intent to broadly construe Title IX to hold schools vicariously liable for their students' actions, or create a federal educational negligence claim by making schools liable when it failed to act to prevent student harassment it \"\n   <em>\n    should have known\n   </em>\n   \" about.\n   <em>\n    Davis\n   </em>\n   ,\n   <extracted-citation case-ids=\"11133593\" index=\"140\" url=\"https://cite.case.law/us/526/629/#p639\">\n    526 U.S. at 642\n   </extracted-citation>\n   ,\n   <extracted-citation case-ids=\"11133593\" index=\"141\" url=\"https://cite.case.law/us/526/629/#p639\">\n    119 S.Ct. 1661\n   </extracted-citation>\n   (emphasis in original);\n   <em>\n    Winzer v.

App'x 679\n   </extracted-citation>\n   , 682 (6th Cir. 2004) (holding the Sixth Circuit has declined to adopt a \"constructive-knowledge standard\" under Title IX). Rather, liability under\n   <em>\n    Davis\n   </em>\n   derives from a school's own conduct, particularly a decision to not act in fulfilling Title IX duties to prevent severe forms of student-on-student sexual harassment, and that duty is triggered upon actual notice of such harassment.\n   <em>\n    <extracted-citation case-ids=\"2173756\" index=\"143\" url=\"https://cite.case.law/f-appx/105/679/#p682\">\n     Id.\n    </extracted-citation>\n   </em>\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-61\">\n   Applying the actual notice standard under\n   <em>\n    Davis\n   </em>\n   is ultimately a matter of who knew what and when. This presents even further questions, however. Starting with the who, obviously school systems are not natural persons capable of personal knowledge. As such, if a school district can be said to have \"actual knowledge\" of harassment, it follows that it is imputed from one of its agent's knowledge. But what sort of agent is capable of imputing notice to the Department in this context? Is the knowledge of a school administrator required? Or is a teacher's knowledge sufficient? Is the knowledge of a non-teaching staff member, such as a nurse, janitor, or cafeteria worker enough? The dissenters in\n   <em>\n    Davis\n   </em>\n   criticized the Court for not addressing this question.\n   <em>\n    <extracted-citation case-ids=\"2173756\" index=\"144\" url=\"https://cite.case.law/f-appx/105/679/#p682\">\n     Id.\n    </extracted-citation>\n   </em>\n   (\"The majority's ...

At a minimum, a person capable of imputing knowledge to a school system-what the\n   <em>\n    Gebser\n   </em>\n   court referred to as an \"appropriate person,\"\n   <extracted-citation case-ids=\"11182276\" index=\"145\" url=\"https://cite.case.law/us/524/274/#p286\">\n    524 U.S. at 290\n   </extracted-citation>\n   ,\n   <extracted-citation case-ids=\"11182276\" index=\"146\" url=\"https://cite.case.law/us/524/274/#p286\">\n    118 S.Ct. 1989\n   </extracted-citation>\n   -must have been entrusted with the school's \"disciplinary authority\" over students.\n   <em>\n    See\n   </em>\n   <em>\n    Davis\n   </em>\n   ,\n   <extracted-citation case-ids=\"11133593\" index=\"147\" url=\"https://cite.case.law/us/526/629/#p639\">\n    526 U.S. at 647\n   </extracted-citation>\n   ,\n   <extracted-citation case-ids=\"11133593\" index=\"148\" url=\"https://cite.case.law/us/526/629/#p639\">\n    119 S.Ct. 1661\n   </extracted-citation>\n   . The crux of the actual knowledge element in this case, then, depends on whether Coach Montgomery was an \"appropriate person.\" In\n   <em>\n    Gebser\n   </em>\n   suits, which involve Title IX claims for teacher-on-student sexual harassment, an \"appropriate person\" capable of imputing knowledge is defined as \"an official who at a minimum has authority to address the alleged discrimination and to institute corrective measures.\"\n   <extracted-citation case-ids=\"11182276\" index=\"149\" url=\"https://cite.case.law/us/524/274/#p286\">\n    524 U.S. at 290\n   </extracted-citation>\n   ,\n   <extracted-citation case-ids=\"11182276\" index=\"150\" url=\"https://cite.case.law/us/524/274/#p286\">\n    118 S.Ct. 1989\n   </extracted-citation>\n   .

However, some courts do not agree with that straightforward rationale. For example, the Eleventh Circuit has added an additional condition to this test and held that an \"appropriate person\" must also be one that is \"high enough up the chain-of-command that his acts constitute an official decision by the school district itself not to remedy the misconduct.\"\n   <em>\n    Floyd v.

[Doc. 185-11 at 10]. However, even then, his role on the school trip went beyond his regular duties. The Department, acting outside of its regular scope, committed itself to the supervision of students on a multiple day trip, including an over two-and-a-half hour journey and overnight stays. In this undertaking to see to the welfare of the players on a days-long trip, the Department vested the responsibility chiefly in one man, Montgomery, although Assistant Coach Williams helped him supervise the team. [Doc. 185 at 5]. There Montgomery was not simply acting as an educator or basketball coach, but as a caretaker and guardian entrusted with the players' well-being, including providing meals, shelter, transportation, and even washing their clothes [\n   <em>\n    see\n   </em>\n   Doc. 185 at 7]. Far from school campus and outside of normal school operating hours, Montgomery was not merely a cog in a larger educational bureaucracy, expected to push harassment problems up the chain of command. Instead, the Department had at least implicitly commissioned him with its full authority to take appropriate disciplinary actions during the trip. Further, in Gatlinburg, he had near autocratic power to dictate the conduct in the cabin, including, for instance, the ability to assign where players slept and what time they went to bed. While acting in this role, Montgomery unquestionably had the authority to address, correct, and prevent student-on-student sexual harassment. As such, the Court finds Montgomery was an \"appropriate person\" while in his capacity as a supervisor and his knowledge can be imputed to the Department.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-64\">\n   Because Montgomery was an \"appropriate person\" under the facts, it must next be determined what he knew prior to Doe and Roe's sexual attacks, and whether it constitutes actual knowledge. \"It is difficult to define what kind of notice is sufficient\"\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-65\">\n   under Title IX.\n   <em>\n    Gustine\n   </em>\n   ,\n   <extracted-citation case-ids=\"3578865\" index=\"158\" url=\"https://cite.case.law/f-supp-2d/678/1008/#p1025\">\n    678 F.Supp.2d at 1029\n   </extracted-citation>\n   (quoting\n   <em>\n    Tesoriero v.

Plaintiffs point to two sources of information that should have provided Montgomery with actual notice of \"severe, pervasive, and objectively unreasonable\" sexual harassment occurring on the basketball team. [Doc. 192 at 6]. First, Plaintiffs claim Montgomery knew of the freshman rackings (the generalized, presumably non-sexual hazing that occurred prior to the Gatlinburg trip), and that the knowledge provided him actual notice of the later severe sexual harassment. [\n   <em>\n    Id.\n   </em>\n   ]. Secondly, Plaintiffs point to Doe and Roe's attackers' disciplinary history and claim it sufficiently provided actual notice of their propensity to engage in sexual harassment. [\n   <em>\n    Id.\n   </em>\n   ]. The Court finds neither argument is persuasive. Each will be discussed in turn.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-66\">\n   Plaintiffs present multiple examples of Montgomery's knowledge of the rackings, all of which were conclusions reached in an independent report commissioned by the school. [Docs. 183 at 9, 185 at 4, &amp; 192 at 8 (citing the independent report) ]. First, Montgomery's office was adjacent to the boys' locker room, where the rackings often occurred. Plaintiffs claim \"it [is] 'unlikely that he would not hear the players banging around' \" next door. [Doc. 185 at 4 (quoting the independent report) ]. Two months prior to the Gatlinburg incidents, a player's mother complained that her son had been hazed. [\n   <em>\n    Id.\n   </em>\n   at 2]. Further, Montgomery encountered physical evidence of roughhousing, such as a broken television that Plaintiffs allege was collateral damage in a racking skirmish. [\n   <em>\n    Id.\n   </em>\n   at 4]. It is also asserted that Montgomery, on several occasions, walked into the locker room to find the players inside with the lights turned off (supposedly the lights were off in relation to freshman beatings), and Montgomery would often say \"stop the horseplay\" and turn on the lights. [\n   <em>\n    Id.\n   </em>\n   at 4-5]. Finally, Plaintiffs proffer the basketball players discussed the rackings in front of Montgomery, and he would occasionally punish upperclassmen for known hazing. [\n   <em>\n    Id.\n   </em>\n   ]. For example, he made one player run \"suicides,\" supposedly as punishment for participating in rackings. [\n   <em>\n    Id.\n   </em>\n   ]. It is not apparent how this scatter shot of speculative and seemingly unrelated evidence amounts to an \"inevitabl[e] ... conclusion\" that Montgomery had pre-assault, actual knowledge of \"severe\" sexual harassment. [Doc. 183 at 9]. But even if he were aware, Plaintiffs face another obstacle.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-67\">\n   The crux of Plaintiffs' argument depends on whether lesser forms of non-sexual hazing can provide notice for serious forms of sexual harassment.

The\n   <em>\n    Mathis\n   </em>\n   case, discussed\n   <em>\n    supra\n   </em>\n   , involved an attack similar to this case in which players on an eighth grade boys' basketball team held down a teammate and anally penetrated him with a magic marker.\n   <em>\n    Mathis\n   </em>\n   ,\n   <extracted-citation case-ids=\"4244709\" index=\"161\" url=\"https://cite.case.law/f-supp-2d/782/542/\">\n    782 F.Supp.2d at 546\n   </extracted-citation>\n   .

[Doc. 192 at 6-8]. However, this assertion is wrong for two reasons. First, there is no evidence from which a reasonable jury\n   <em>\n    must\n   </em>\n   conclude Montgomery was fully aware of the rackings or their alleged severity. And secondly, even if he were aware, knowledge of the non-sexual hazing does not constitute actual knowledge of the \"kind of harassment\" underlying this case: the sexual assaults.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-68\">\n   Prior to their sexual attacks, Students A, B, and C had past disciplinary problems, which Plaintiffs claim put the Department on notice of their potential for sexual harassment. Under\n   <em>\n    Davis\n   </em>\n   , actual knowledge can be derived from a harasser's past harassment. These past acts may provide a school notice if the conduct demonstrates a pattern of and propensity for sexual harassment, even if prior harassing was not directed toward the plaintiff specifically.\n   <em>\n    See\n   </em>\n   <em>\n    Gustine\n   </em>\n   ,\n   <extracted-citation case-ids=\"3578865\" index=\"166\" url=\"https://cite.case.law/f-supp-2d/678/1008/#p1025\">\n    678 F.Supp.2d at 1030\n   </extracted-citation>\n   (collecting cases);\n   <em>\n    see also\n   </em>\n   <em>\n    Delgado v.

Ariz. 2008) ). Plaintiffs point to a whole host of student behavior it claims put the Department on notice for the potential of sexual harassment at OHS. For instance, Plaintiffs broadly focus on school wide, generalized bullying that often occurred at OHS, what they claim was a \"bullying epidemic.\" [Doc. 179 at 7]. However, knowledge of general bullying among various students-which has likely occurred to some degree in every school since there were schools-falls far short of\n   providing actual notice of on-going student-on-student sexual harassment or its potential. Outside of generalized bullying, Plaintiffs do point to a few prior acts specific to Doe and Roe's attackers. For example, it is asserted Student A had previously been disciplined for bullying and \"rough housing.\" [Doc. 185 at 6]. Likewise, Student B \"had been officially reprimanded for engaging in sexually inappropriate behavior, 'horseplay,' and misconduct that warranted suspending him for three OHS basketball games.\" [\n   <em>\n    Id.\n   </em>\n   ] And Student C \"was formally disciplined by the school system for fighting and possessing an adult video on his phone.\" [\n   <em>\n    Id.\n   </em>\n   ]. Despite Plaintiffs' reliance on these disciplinary events, they are not prior acts of\n   <em>\n    sexual harassment\n   </em>\n   sufficient to put the Department on notice. Obviously, the fighting, \"horseplay,\" \"rough housing,\" and bullying say little about a person's propensity for sexual harassment and, as such, cannot provide actual knowledge of conduct covered by Title IX. Further, the other incidents, the events cited as being \"sexual\" in nature, are likewise insufficient because Plaintiffs fail to demonstrate how the conduct is associated with sexual harassment, and if the information was demonstrably linked to covered conduct, it is otherwise stale. For instance, Student B's prior \"sexually inappropriate behavior\" refers to a 2011 incident, four years prior to the Gatlinburg assaults, in which a then fourteen-year-old Student B and two other boys told jokes with phallic innuendos. [Doc. 185-16 at 3]. This event hardly gave the Department notice that Student B was a potential sexual harasser. Further, a pornographic video was found on Student C's cellphone in 2013, two years prior to the Gatlinburg attacks. Nevertheless, Student C was not caught watching the video while at school or showing it to classmates, which could possibly demonstrate a propensity for a troubling sexual perversion. Rather, school officials were investigating Student C's cellphone after he used it to record a school fight when they stumbled on to the adult video on his phone. [Doc. 185-17 at 4]. These events do not support a conclusion that the Department had actual knowledge that Doe and Roe's attackers were sexual assault risks, and as such, they fail to support Plaintiffs burden. Although this and the non-sexual hazing are insufficient, other evidence in the record can suffice.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-69\">\n   The facts surrounding the Gatlinburg incidents support an inference of actual knowledge. A rational fact finder could conclude from the evidence that Coach Montgomery knew about team sexual assaults prior to Doe and Roe's attacks, and therefore had actual knowledge. As an initial matter, it appears upperclassmen sexually assaulting freshman with pool cues was not a new or novel practice for the team. For example, prior to the sexual assaults, Student A told Doe that in years past \"upper classmen had ... 'used the pool sticks on him,' \" and Doe overheard the upperclassmen joking about using the cues. [Doc. 179 at 4]. Depending on whether Montgomery was present during these statements, they may be admissible for the non-hearsay purpose of demonstrating Montgomery's knowledge.\n   <em>\n    See\n   </em>\n   <em>\n    In re Morrison\n   </em>\n   ,\n   <extracted-citation case-ids=\"3339913,5584515\" index=\"170\" url=\"https://cite.case.law/f3d/555/473/\">\n    555 F.3d 473\n   </extracted-citation>\n   , 483 (5th Cir. 2009). Further, at the cabin, Montgomery claimed the walls were thin and that he was able to hear the players downstairs, including even their conversations. [Doc. 185 at 8]. On December 20th, Students A, B, and C held down their first victim, Student F, and used a pool cue to simulate sodomy on him. [Doc. 185 at 7]. Throughout this ordeal, Student F screamed. [\n   <em>\n    Id.\n   </em>\n   ]. If Montgomery was able to hear the players' conversations while upstairs, it follows he should have been able to hear their screams and scuffles as well. After Student\n   F's attack, Students A and B wrestled Roe to the ground and again simulated sodomy with a pool cue while yelling \"take it like a man\" and \"don't be a pussy,\" and like Student F, Roe screamed. [\n   <em>\n    Id.\n   </em>\n   ]. The next day, Student H was similarly attacked and also screamed. [\n   <em>\n    Id.\n   </em>\n   ]. During this attack, Doe was sitting on the cabin stairs, near the upstairs area where Montgomery was at the time, and Doe could clearly hear Student H's screams. [\n   <em>\n    Id.\n   </em>\n   at 8]. Likewise, on the following day, Roe was standing near the top of the stairs with Assistant Coach Williams just prior to Doe's rape. [\n   <em>\n    Id.\n   </em>\n   at 8]. From that vantage point, Roe could see Students A, B, and C carrying a pool cue and pushing Doe into a room. [\n   <em>\n    Id.\n   </em>\n   ] He told Assistant Coach Williams what he saw. [\n   <em>\n    Id.\n   </em>\n   ]. Williams did not intervene, Doe was raped, and Roe could hear his screams from where he was standing. [\n   <em>\n    Id.\n   </em>\n   at 8]. In sum, the attacks occurred daily. During the attacks, the attackers verbally badgered their victims, who screamed and attempted to fight off their assailants. These surely were not subtle events. When considered in the context of Montgomery's claim that he could hear the players while upstairs, a reasonable fact finder could deduce Montgomery had actual knowledge of the sexual assaults at some point prior to Doe and Roe's attack. As such, the Department's Motion for Summary Judgment [Doc. 177] will be\n   <strong>\n    DENIED\n   </strong>\n   on this issue. On the other hand, the Court finds this is a close factual question; reasonable minds could reach different conclusions based on the evidence. In these situations, summary judgment is not appropriate in either direction. Accordingly, Plaintiffs' Motion for Partial Summary Judgment is likewise\n   <strong>\n    DENIED\n   </strong>\n   .\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-70\">\n   <strong>\n    3.

[Doc. 177-1 at 22]. As a result, Doe and Roe and the assailants never came into contact during school operations ever again. [\n   <em>\n    Id.\n   </em>\n   at 23]. The Department hired an attorney, Courtney Bullard, to conduct an investigation into the Gatlinburg incidents on March 22, 2016, less than three months after the event. [Doc. 182-11 at 1].

If true, the statements are clearly unreasonable, but Plaintiffs do not allege any further harassment arising from these statements. So, Title IX liability does not flow from the actions standing alone. Likewise, although perhaps Principal Jarvis should have contacted the affected families personally following the Gatlinburg incidents, Title IX does not impose financial liability on school for the moral blunders or social faux pas committed by its administrators. Accordingly, Principal Jarvis' failure to be conciliatory following the attacks does not constitute deliberate indifference as defined by Title IX.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-81\">\n   To be clear, Roe did experience harassment following his sexual assault,\n   <em>\n    see supra\n   </em>\n   part III.A.1.b, but there is no evidence that he reported this to school officials or that the school otherwise had actual notice of his post-assault harassment. As such, the harassment cannot support a post-assault deliberate indifference claim.

Regardless of whether Montgomery improperly accessed the players' records, irrespective of FERPA, or knew of students' actions outside of those records, the claim would still fail. \"Although [defendant] was [possibly] aware of [Students A's, B's, and C's] disruptive and violent behavior, no reasonable fact finder could conclude [he] knew\" the students would cause \"serious harm\" by using a pool cue to sexually assault freshman players or inflict grave physical injuries on Doe.\n   <em>\n    <extracted-citation case-ids=\"881057\" index=\"280\" url=\"https://cite.case.law/f3d/433/460/#p464\">\n     Id.\n    </extracted-citation>\n   </em>\n   As such, Plaintiffs have failed to raise a genuine issue of material fact as to the state-created-danger claim.

The evidentiary record does not contain sufficient factual evidence for a jury to reach a reasonable conclusion that Naydley violated Doe's and Roe's constitutional rights. As evidence, Plaintiffs assert that one former player and a player's parent once contacted Naydley to report team bullying. [Doc. 184 at 7]. Plaintiffs also claim Naydley could often hear players \"horse playing\" in the team locker room because his office was located in close proximity. Further, relying on Bullard's and another expert's conclusory statements, Plaintiffs assert varsity team rackings \"dat[ed] back through Nayadley's tenure\" as Athletic Director and his time as the varsity team's Head Coach, and \"beyond.\" [\n   <em>\n    Id.\n   </em>\n   ]. Apparently, the Plaintiffs believe this is evidence Nayadley had actual knowledge of team gender-based discrimination. However, the Court finds the assertions fail to support a reasonable inference regarding Naydley's knowledge of student-on-student gendered bullying. Without such knowledge, Naydley cannot\n   be liable for being constitutionally deliberately indifferent to gender based harassment. Accordingly, Plaintiffs have failed to raise a genuine issue as to the \u00a7 1983 claims against Naydley.

To be clear, it is not the Plaintiffs' assertion that they were never notified of the assaults; they admit they were.\n   <footnotemark>\n    8\n   </footnotemark>\n   Jarvis's inaction, instead, is in regard to his refusal to conciliate the players (including non-victims) and their families.

This refusal so frustrated the Department's \"independent investigator,\" Courtney Bullard, that she asked the Department's attorney, Scott Bennett, to try to convince Jarvis to contact the players' families. [Doc. 184 at 8]. After he likewise failed to encourage Jarvis to do so, Bennett claimed he was \"about ready to shoot Jarvis in the head,\" and that \"no other principal in the 'entire district' would take [Jarvis's] stance.\" [\n   <em>\n    Id.\n   </em>\n   at 8-9].

[Doc. 179 at 8]. In a 2013 survey, over half of OHS students reported being bullied at school. [\n   <em>\n    Id.\n   </em>\n   ]. Given this, it is more than likely the Department's staff and teachers at OHS would encounter students bullying one another, or at least receive complaints to that effect. On the other hand, not all schoolhouse bullying is discriminatory on the basis of gender or some other suspect class, which is what the Constitution and Title IX are ultimately concerned with. However, given the amount of bullying that occurred here, it was important for the Department to train OHS staff on how to not only reasonably respond to common bullying, but to also be able to distinguish more insidious forms of discriminatory harassment that occurs on the basis of some immutable characteristic, such as biological sex. It is these discriminatory forms of harassment that require increased school vigilance and a heightened response to ensure compliance with the demands of equal protection and the mandates of Title IX.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-130\">\n   Here, Department failed to adequately train OHS staff and teachers. Montgomery, for instance, claimed he never received any training on student-on-student discriminatory harassment, or training on Title IX and its requirements. [Doc. 179 at 10]. More specifically, Montgomery explained he was never instructed how to recognize student-on-student sexual harassment. [\n   <em>\n    Id.\n   </em>\n   ]. Although the Department claims it conducted bullying and Title IX trainings at OHS, Plaintiffs proffer evidence that these trainings were not only substantively inadequate, often being brief and not detailed, but also never involved staff beyond a small number of administrators, many of which were no longer with the school at times relevant to this case. [Doc. 192 at 18-20]. Montgomery certainly did not attend any of these trainings. The Court is sympathetic to the fact that schools have many obligations to students, and that choosing among the many relevant trainings-ranging from academics to school shooters-often involves unfortunate zero sum options, requiring some trainings to be left out due to financial and time constraints. With that being said, if a school district employee has served a school in a capacity that often puts them in close proximity to students, and they serve in that role for any significant length of time, at least some acquaintance with Title IX and student-on-student harassment training seems to be at least minimally necessary. Yet here, Montgomery, despite serving at the school for almost six years prior to the sexual assaults, claims he never received any such training. A reasonable fact finder could conclude this was a result of the Department's deliberate indifference to an obvious need for relevant Title IX and student-on-student harassment\n   training. Further, it would not be unreasonable for a jury to conclude that this failure was causally related to Doe's and Roe's injuries.\n   <footnotemark>\n    9\n   </footnotemark>\n   Accordingly, the Department's Motion for Summary Judgment [Doc. 177] is\n   <strong>\n    DENIED\n   </strong>\n   . However, because there are genuine issues of material fact regarding what Montgomery knew in regard to the sexual assaults, the failure to train claim cannot be resolved at the summary judgment stage.

First, because Montgomery's \u00a7 1983 claim for deliberate indifference will be dismissed under qualified immunity, does the claim still constitute an injury arising out\n   of a \"civil right[ ],\" excepting the removal of immunity? It is not clear.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-135\">\n   Further, it is unclear whether Title IX is a \"civil rights\" claim as that term is used by the TGTLA. Because Title IX was enacted pursuant to Congress' spending clause power rather than its Fourteenth Amendment enforcement power, the law does not protect constitutional rights, at least not directly. Rather, it is more appropriately viewed as a contractual condition to the receipt of federal funds.\n   <em>\n    Gebser\n   </em>\n   ,\n   <extracted-citation case-ids=\"11182276\" index=\"318\" url=\"https://cite.case.law/us/524/274/#p286\">\n    524 U.S. at 284\n   </extracted-citation>\n   ,\n   <extracted-citation case-ids=\"11182276\" index=\"319\" url=\"https://cite.case.law/us/524/274/#p286\">\n    118 S.Ct. 1989\n   </extracted-citation>\n   (\"Title IX's contractual nature has implications for our construction of the scope of available remedies.\").
