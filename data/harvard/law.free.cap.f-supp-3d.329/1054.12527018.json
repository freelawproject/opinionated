INTRODUCTION\n   </strong>\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-11\">\n   Plaintiff Pure Data Systems, LLC (\"PDS\") filed this case against Defendant Ubisoft, Inc. alleging that Ubisoft directly\n   and indirectly infringed the claims of two patents that PDS owns, U.S. Patent Nos. 5,999,947 (the \" '947 patent\") and 6,321,236 (the \" '236 patent\").\n   <footnotemark>\n    1\n   </footnotemark>\n   The patents relate to a method of and system for distributing differences between data storage systems. Ubisoft moves to dismiss PDS's complaint pursuant to Rule 12(b)(6) of the Federal Rules of Civil Procedure. First, Ubisoft argues that the patents are directed to patent-ineligible subject matter under\n   <extracted-citation index=\"0\" url=\"https://cite.case.law/citations/?q=35%20U.S.C.%20%C2%A7%20101\">\n    35 U.S.C. \u00a7 101\n   </extracted-citation>\n   . Second, Ubisoft argues that PDS's claims of indirect infringement under\n   <extracted-citation index=\"1\" url=\"https://cite.case.law/citations/?q=35%20U.S.C.%20%C2%A7%20271\">\n    35 U.S.C. \u00a7 271\n   </extracted-citation>\n   (b) and \u00a7 271(c) lack a plausible allegation that Ubisoft had knowledge of the infringing acts. The Court held a hearing on July 13, 2018. For the reasons stated below, Ubisoft's motion to dismiss is DENIED IN PART and GRANTED IN PART. PDS may proceed on its claims for direct infringement but its indirect infringement claims are dismissed with leave to amend.\n   <footnotemark>\n    2\n   </footnotemark>\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-12\">\n   <strong>\n    II. BACKGROUND\n   </strong>\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-13\">\n   <strong>\n    A. The '947 Patent\n   </strong>\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-14\">\n   <strong>\n    1. Overview\n   </strong>\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-15\">\n   The '947 patent was filed on May 27, 1997 and covers a \"method of distributing database differences.\" '947 Patent (cover page paragraph [22] ); Compl. (dkt. 1) \u00b6 18. Specifically, the '947 patent concerns a \"method, computer program product, and system that allows changes made to an original database table found on a server computer to be reflected in client copies of the database table based on intermittent client requests for synchronization.\" '947 Patent (cover page paragraph [57] ). In other words, a client computer that maintains a local copy of a database can receive updates on demand from a server, and the server will transmit only the changes to the database since that client last received an update, without needing to transmit data that has not changed. PDS claims the invention solves a \"problem unique to data storage systems, by greatly enhancing and facilitating the operation and efficiency of data storage systems.\" Compl. \u00b6 2. For example, the invention improves the functioning of data storage systems by \"efficiently using system resources and permitting client systems that are intermittently (as opposed to continuously) connected to a server system to synchronize with information from the server.\"\n   <em>\n    <extracted-citation index=\"2\" url=\"https://cite.case.law/citations/?q=35%20U.S.C.%20%C2%A7%20271\">\n     Id.\n    </extracted-citation>\n   </em>\n   \u00b6 3 (citing '947 Patent at 1:9-19).\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-16\">\n   <strong>\n    2. Claims\n   </strong>\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-17\">\n   The '947 patent includes fourteen claims. '947 Patent at (cover page paragraph [57] ). PDS alleges in this action that Ubisoft, a video game company, directly infringes Claim 6 of the '947 patent in Ubisoft's game library updates, game statistics updates, and game updates.\n   <em>\n    <extracted-citation index=\"3\" url=\"https://cite.case.law/citations/?q=35%20U.S.C.%20%C2%A7%20271\">\n     Id.\n    </extracted-citation>\n   </em>\n   <extracted-citation index=\"3\" url=\"https://cite.case.law/citations/?q=35%20U.S.C.%20%C2%A7%20271\">\n    \u00b6\u00b6 20-21, 27-29, 35, 38, 45\n   </extracted-citation>\n   .

In its opposition brief, PDS seeks to reserve the right to assert additional claims, such as those dependent on the asserted claim, like Claims 8 and 9. Opp'n (dkt. 42) at 7.

However, the '947 patent states that this requires \"large amounts of bandwidth on the communications link\" and \"will make for an expensive and time consuming transfer that, in many instances, will be intolerable and impracticable.\"\n   <em>\n    <extracted-citation index=\"8\" url=\"https://cite.case.law/citations/?q=35%20U.S.C.%20%C2%A7%20271\">\n     Id.\n    </extracted-citation>\n   </em>\n   <extracted-citation index=\"8\" url=\"https://cite.case.law/citations/?q=35%20U.S.C.%20%C2%A7%20271\">\n    at 2:5-8\n   </extracted-citation>\n   . Additionally, the '947 patent acknowledges another prior art system that \"make[s] a comparison of the client representation of the database (or other form of data store) and the original database on the server at the time that the client makes a connection with the server.\"\n   <em>\n    <extracted-citation index=\"9\" url=\"https://cite.case.law/citations/?q=35%20U.S.C.%20%C2%A7%20271\">\n     Id.\n    </extracted-citation>\n   </em>\n   <extracted-citation index=\"9\" url=\"https://cite.case.law/citations/?q=35%20U.S.C.%20%C2%A7%20271\">\n    at 2:9-12\n   </extracted-citation>\n   .

Compl. \u00b6 5. PDS states that the '947 patent was distinguished on the grounds that Buchanan \"merely discloses the concept of bi-directional synchronization\n   of a client database and a server database, and does not make any reference to translating database differences at a particular data format.\"\n   <em>\n    <extracted-citation index=\"12\" url=\"https://cite.case.law/citations/?q=U.S.%20Patent%20No.%205%2C758%2C355\">\n     Id.\n    </extracted-citation>\n   </em>\n   Additionally, PDS alleges that the USPTO attempted to apply as prior art\n   <extracted-citation index=\"13\" url=\"https://cite.case.law/citations/?q=U.S.%20Patent%20No.%205%2C634%2C052\">\n    U.S. Patent No. 5,634,052\n   </extracted-citation>\n   (\"Morris\").\n   <em>\n    <extracted-citation index=\"14\" url=\"https://cite.case.law/citations/?q=U.S.%20Patent%20No.%205%2C634%2C052\">\n     Id.\n    </extracted-citation>\n   </em>\n   <extracted-citation index=\"14\" url=\"https://cite.case.law/citations/?q=U.S.%20Patent%20No.%205%2C634%2C052\">\n    \u00b6 6\n   </extracted-citation>\n   .

While that scenario leaves open the possibility of a more direct analogy to the patents at issue-the representative might make ad hoc requests for updates, as opposed to the periodic mailing of pocket parts, and it is conceivable that the company might convert its updates to different formats or languages to meet the needs of different representatives-the Court has no knowledge of any actual use of such a practice, much less any confidence that the common use of such a practice is \"is generally known within [this] court's territorial jurisdiction.\"\n   <em>\n    Cf.\n   </em>\n   Fed.

The '947 patent was filed on May 27, 1997, and the '236 patent was filed as a continuation of that application, subject to the same twenty year patent term provision. '236 Patent (cover page paragraphs [ * ], [63] ). Therefore, both patents expired on May 27, 2017-before PDS filed its complaint. While PDS alleges indirect infringement in its complaint,\n   <em>\n    see\n   </em>\n   Compl. \u00b6\u00b6 19, 46, 50, 76, PDS fails to allege any facts that plausibly show that Ubisoft, during the time the patents were in force, knew its acts were infringing, and PDS does not address this issue in its opposition brief. Instead, all of PDS's arguments are directed to the subject matter eligibility of its claims. Because PDS fails to plausibly allege knowledge as required for indirect infringement claims under \u00a7 271(b) and (c), these claims are dismissed with leave to amend.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-111\">\n   <strong>\n    IV.

Because there is no basis to conclude at this stage that the methods described in the complaint were routine and conventional at the time of patenting, the Court need not resolve whether the potential application of similar methods to non-digital data storage and transmission, such as in Ubisoft's analogy to a company sending partial catalog updates to its sales representatives in the field, differentiates the claims at issue from patents that have been held to satisfy step 2 of the\n    <em>\n     Alice\n    </em>\n    test based on their specificity to technological problems and contexts.
