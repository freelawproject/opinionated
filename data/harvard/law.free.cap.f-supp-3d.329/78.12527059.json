INTRODUCTION\n   </strong>\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-10\">\n   This is an insurance action against Defendants Ohio National Life Assurance Corporation and Ohio National Life Insurance Company for life insurance proceeds. Plaintiffs Nicholas Lomma and J.L., a minor, by his guardian, Anthony Lomma, seek to recover $100,000 as beneficiaries of a life insurance policy issued by Defendants on the life of their mother, Lora Marie Lomma, who committed suicide in May of 2009. Defendants have denied payment of full death benefits based on a suicide exclusion in the policy.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-11\">\n   On September 6, 2017, the Court granted Defendants' motion to dismiss in part and denied the motion in part, allowing the breach of contract, breach of implied covenant of good faith and fair dealing, and statutory bad faith claims to proceed because Plaintiffs had sufficiently pled ambiguity in the contract language and a reasonable expectation of coverage, and plausibly pled bad faith on the part of Defendants. Doc. 24. Presently before the Court are cross motions for summary judgment by both Plaintiffs and Defendants. Both motions primarily concern the same issue: whether the suicide exclusion precludes Plaintiffs from full coverage under the policy. Docs. 29, 31. For the reasons that follow, Plaintiffs' motion will be granted in part and denied in part, and Defendants' motion will be granted in part and denied in part.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-12\">\n   <strong>\n    II. STATEMENT OF UNDISPUTED FACTS\n   </strong>\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-13\">\n   Both parties have submitted Statements of Material Facts as to which they submit there is no genuine issue or dispute for trial for their respective motions for summary judgment. Docs. 29, 31. Both parties have also submitted responses to the statements of material facts in their opposition to the opposing party's motion for summary judgment. Docs. 38, 39. The parties base their arguments primarily on Ms. Lomma's policy with Defendants and related policy documents such as the \"Notice Regarding Replacement of Life Insurance and Annuities\" (the \"Notice\"), which had already been presented to the Court through Defendant's motion to dismiss. Doc. 4-4. Thus, the factual issues remain substantively the same as those presented at the motion to dismiss stage. The following facts are not reasonably in dispute except as noted.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-14\">\n   Ms. Lomma committed suicide on May 24, 2009. Doc. 29 \u00b6 6. Plaintiffs, Nicholas Lomma and J.L., the surviving children of Ms. Lomma, bring suit against Defendants for the denial of life insurance benefits. Doc. 1-4 \u00b6\u00b6 1-2. In September 1986, Ms. Lomma was issued a life insurance policy (the \"Original Policy\") by Pennsylvania National Life Insurance Company with a coverage amount of $25,000. Doc. \u00b6 29 1. The Original Policy contained a suicide exclusion, which states \"SUICIDE: If, within two years from the Issue Date, the Insured, while sane or insane, commits suicide, our liability will be limited to a refund of the premium paid less any Policy Indebtedness and Partial Withdrawals.\" Doc. 29-2 at 15. In 1994, Defendants Ohio National Life Assurance Corporation and/or Ohio National Life Insurance Company \"purchased or otherwise acquired the Original Policy from Pennsylvania National Life Insurance Company.\" Doc. 29 at \u00b6 2. Although this assertion is \"denied as stated\" by Defendants, they do not deny that the assumption of the policy occurred. Doc. 38 \u00b6 2. Instead, they clarify that only Defendant Ohio National\n   <em>\n    Life Assurance\n   </em>\n   Corporation \"assumed\" the Original Policy, and that Defendant \"Ohio National\n   <em>\n    Life Insurance\n   </em>\n   Company was not involved in the transaction.\"\n   <em>\n    Id.\n   </em>\n   (emphasis added). In support of their \"denial\", Defendants submitted a 2006 letter from Ohio National\n   <em>\n    Life Assurance\n   </em>\n   Corporation to Ms. Lomma, clarifying \"a drafting error\" with respect to a formula set forth in the policy as required by the Internal Revenue Code (the \"2006 Letter\"). Doc. 38-2 at 38. The \"drafting error\" bears no relevance to the case at hand. Rather, the 2006 Letter is introduced solely for the proposition that Ohio National\n   <em>\n    Life Assurance\n   </em>\n   Corporation is the only Defendant that contracted with Ms. Lomma.\n   <em>\n    Id.\n   </em>\n   (2006 Letter stating \"[a]s you know, Ohio National\n   <em>\n    Life Assurance\n   </em>\n   Corporation has been administering your policy since June 30, 1994, when we assumed all obligations and liabilities under your policy as originally issued by Pennsylvania\n   National Life Insurance Company\") (emphasis added). However, Defendants do not explain why the distinction between the two Ohio National entities is significant, nor do they base their legal arguments on this distinction. Indeed, Defendants have chosen to jointly file all motion papers to the Court. Further, Defendants repeatedly refer to themselves jointly as \"Ohio National\" in all motion papers, even though there are two \"Ohio National\" entities. Thus, the Court finds that it is undisputed that Defendants assumed the Original Policy from Penn National Life Insurance Company in 1994.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-15\">\n   On December 4, 1995, Ms. Lomma increased the amount of coverage under the Original Policy with Defendants from $25,000 to $100,000. Doc. 29 \u00b6 3.\n   <em>\n    See also\n   </em>\n   Doc. 29-3 at 3 (December 14, 1995 Letter from Defendants, stating that \"[u]pon written request ... the stated amount is hereby increased from $25,000 to $100,000 effective December 4, 1995\"). On June 6, 2007, Ms. Lomma filed an application for a new life insurance policy with Defendants with a coverage amount of $100,000 (the \"Replacement Policy\"). Doc. 29 4.\n   <em>\n    See also\n   </em>\n   Doc. 29-4 (Ms. Lomma's application for change of policy).\n   <footnotemark>\n    1\n   </footnotemark>\n   On August 15, 2007, Defendants issued the Replacement Policy to Ms. Lomma with a benefit value of $100,000.\n   <em>\n    Id.\n   </em>\n   \u00b6 5. While the amount of insurance coverage stayed the same, the parties dispute whether the beneficiaries changed upon the switch to the Replacement Policy. According to Plaintiffs, the beneficiaries under the Replacement Policy \"were identical to those under the Original Policy.\"\n   <em>\n    Id.\n   </em>\n   However, the documents submitted by the parties reflect a change in the designation of beneficiaries at the time of the policy switch.\n   <em>\n    Compare\n   </em>\n   Doc. 38-2 at 20 (Original Policy designating Anthony Lomma as the primary beneficiary and Ms. Lomma's children as contingency beneficiaries)\n   <em>\n    with\n   </em>\n   Doc. 29-4 at 3 (Application for change of policy listing Nicholas Lomma as the primary beneficiary and J.L. as the contingent beneficiary).\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-16\">\n   As part of the switch in policy, Defendants provided Ms. Lomma a \"Notice Regarding Replacement of Life Insurance and Annuities,\" which was executed in June, 2007. Doc. 31 at 9;\n   <em>\n    see also\n   </em>\n   Doc. 31-3 at 39. It provides:\n  </p>\n  <blockquote id=\"p-17\">\n   You should recognize that a policy that has been in existence for a period of time may have certain advantages to you over a new policy.... Under your existing policy, the period of time during which the issuing company could contest the policy because of a material misrepresentation or omission concerning the medical information requested in your application, or deny coverage for death caused by suicide, may have expired or may expire earlier than it will under the proposed policy.\n  </blockquote>\n  <p id=\"p-18\">\n   <em>\n    Id.\n   </em>\n   While the Notice was attached to Defendants' motion to dismiss, the Court declined to consider it then because it was not \"undisputedly authentic\" nor \"integral to Plaintiffs' Complaint, but is instead relevant to Defendants'\n   <em>\n    affirmative defenses.\n   </em>\n   \" Doc. 24 at 8 n.5 (emphasis in original). At this stage, however, the Notice is properly before the Court as part of the record, and its validity is undisputed by Plaintiffs.\n   <em>\n    See\n   </em>\n   Doc. 39 \u00b6 4 (admitting the language in the Notice but denying its \"legal effect imputed by Defendants onto this provision\").\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-19\">\n   Defendants issued the Replacement Policy to Ms. Lomma in August, 2007. Doc.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-20\">\n   31-3 at 1-34 (hereinafter the \"Replacement Policy\"). It contains a definition of \"Contract Months and Years,\" which states: \"[t]his contract takes effect on the contract date shown on page 3. Contract months and years are marked from the contract date. The first day of the contract year is the contract date and its anniversaries.\"\n   <em>\n    Id.\n   </em>\n   at 11. Page 3 of the Replacement Policy contains two dates, neither of which is labeled the \"contract date\". Instead, page 3 shows a \"Policy Date\" of August 10, 2007 and an \"Issue Date\" of August 15, 2007.\n   <em>\n    Id.\n   </em>\n   at 7.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-21\">\n   The Replacement Policy, like the Original Policy, contains a suicide exclusion. The two exclusions, however, do not contain the same language. The suicide exclusion in the Replacement Policy provides:\n  </p>\n  <blockquote id=\"p-22\">\n   If the insured dies by suicide while sane or insane or by intentional self-destruction while insane, we will not pay any death proceed[s] payable on\n   <strong>\n    amounts of insurance\n   </strong>\n   which have been in effect for less than 2 years. If the suicide or intentional self-destruction is within the first 2\n   <strong>\n    contract years\n   </strong>\n   , we will pay as death proceeds the premiums you paid.\n  </blockquote>\n  <p id=\"p-23\">\n   Replacement Policy at 13 (emphasis added). Although the Replacement Policy defines the term \"contract years,\" it does not contain a definition for \"amounts or insurance\", nor does it provide any guidance on how to determine which \"amounts of insurance\" have \"been in effect for less than 2 years.\"\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-24\">\n   Shortly after Ms. Lomma's death, Mr. Lomma filed a claim for death benefits on behalf of his children, the beneficiaries under the Replacement Policy. Doc. 29 7. On August 31, 2009, Defendants informed Mr. Lomma that they would not pay the full benefit value under the policy, but instead, pay \"$285.12 plus interest at 4.5%,\" which represents the \"premiums paid on the policy.\" Doc. 31-3 at 36. The letter explained that Defendants' investigation revealed that Ms. Lomma died by suicide, and in accordance with the policy's suicide exclusion, \"the death proceeds for death due to 'Suicide' within the first two contract years is a refund of premiums paid.\"\n   <em>\n    Id.\n   </em>\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-25\">\n   Plaintiffs brought suit against Defendants for the full $100,000 in coverage, alleging five causes of action: (1) breach of contract; (2) unjust enrichment; (3) promissory estoppel; (4) breach of implied covenant of good faith and fair dealing; and (5) statutory bad faith pursuant to 42 Pa. C.S.A. \u00a7 8371. Doc. 1-4. At the motion to dismiss stage, the Court found the suicide exclusion to be ambiguous, and denied Defendants' motion with respect to the breach of contract, breach of implied covenant of good faith and fair dealing, and statutory bad faith claims. Doc. 25 (denying the motion to dismiss with respects to Counts I, IV, and V). Finding the unjust enrichment and promissory estoppel claims to be precluded by the existence of an express contract between the parties, the Court dismissed Counts II and III of the Complaint.\n   <em>\n    Id.\n   </em>\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-26\">\n   After discovery, Defendants moved for summary judgment on all three remaining claims. Doc. 31. Meanwhile, Plaintiffs moved for summary judgment on the breach of contract claim and the statutory bad faith claim.\n   <footnotemark>\n    2\n   </footnotemark>\n   Both parties have largely recycled their arguments from the motion to dismiss briefing for their briefing on summary judgment. Further, the parties have added no additional evidence to the record since the Court's ruling on motion to dismiss, but instead focus their arguments on the legal interpretation of the policy language. The only \"new\" document\n   relevant to the insurance transaction at issue is the Notice, which had been attached to Defendant's motion to dismiss but was declined to be considered by this Court as extrinsic to the Complaint. Doc. 24 at 8 n. 5. See\n   <em>\n    also\n   </em>\n   Doc. 43 at 1-2 (Defendants' reply brief in support of their motion for summary judgment arguing that \"evidence that this court did not consider in ruling on Ohio National's motion to dismiss is now available for consideration,\" and citing exclusively to the Notice, which \"must now be considered as evidence supporting Ohio National's interpretation of the suicide exclusion and motion for summary judgment\"). The parties do not dispute the validity of the relevant documents before the Court, nor have they presented any disputed issues of fact through any discovery evidence, such as use of deposition testimony. Thus, it appears that the parties' sole dispute turns on the interpretation of the suicide exclusion when viewing the policy and related documents as whole. For reasons stated below, the Court will grant summary judgment in favor of Plaintiffs on the breach of contract claim, and summary judgment in favor Defendants on the breach of implied covenant of good faith and statutory bad faith claims.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-27\">\n   <strong>\n    III.

Doc. 24 at 13-39. As the parties have produced almost no new evidence before the Court, and given that their central dispute is the correct legal interpretation of the suicide exclusion, the Court will once again begin its analysis with the contract language. The suicide exclusion, which is at the heart of the parties' dispute, contains only two sentences:\n  </p>\n  <blockquote id=\"p-39\">\n   If the insured dies by suicide while sane or insane or by intentional self-destruction while insane, we will not pay any death proceed[s] payable on amounts of insurance which have been in effect for less than 2 years.

Defendants seek summary judgment on the breach of contract claim based on the same arguments\n   from their motion to dismiss, namely, that the suicide exclusion's\n   <em>\n    second\n   </em>\n   sentence bars coverage for the full policy value of $100,000, and Plaintiffs could not have reasonably expected full coverage based on the plain language of the suicide exclusion.\n   <em>\n    See\n   </em>\n   Doc. 31 at 15-20;\n   <em>\n    see also\n   </em>\n   Doc. 38 at 14-15 (Defendants' brief in opposition to Plaintiffs' motion for summary judgment arguing the same). In support of their argument, Defendants point to the fact that \"contract years\" is a defined term in the policy, which states \"[t]his contract takes effect on the contract date shown on page 3. Contract months and years are marked from the contract date.\" Replacement Policy at 11. Because the second sentence of the exclusion provides that Defendants only need to pay back premium payments if the insured commits suicide \"within the first 2 contract years.\" Defendants argue that they correctly applied the exclusion to Plaintiffs' case by returning the premiums paid by Ms. Lomma on the Replacement Policy. Doc. 31 at 15-16. They further argue that the two sentences of the exclusion should be treated as independent sentences that \"addresses two different situations: a) any increase in the benefit amount under the [Replacement] Policy, and b) suicide within two years of the start of the contract.\"\n   <em>\n    Id.\n   </em>\n   at 16. Under Defendants' reading, the first sentence is irrelevant to Plaintiffs' case since no increase in the benefit has occurred within two years of Ms. Lomma's suicide-and thus no increase in \"amounts of insurance\" has been \"in effect for less than 2 years.\" However, the second sentence separately and independently bars coverage, since Ms. Lomma committed suicide less than two years after Replacement Policy's contract date.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-41\">\n   Plaintiffs, predictably, ask the Court to focus on the first sentence of the exclusion, which indicates that if the \"amounts of insurance\" has been in effect for more than two years, the suicide exclusion does not apply.\n   <em>\n    See, e.g.\n   </em>\n   , Doc. 30 at 7 (\"Given that Ms. Lomma had the same amount of insurance for over thirteen years, her death does not fall within the suicide exclusion ... [The second sentence]\n   <em>\n    only applies when the insured's death falls within the suicide exclusion.\n   </em>\n   As Ms. Lomma's suicide does not fall within the exclusion, the second sentence is irrelevant in this case.\") (emphasis in original). In other words, Plaintiffs argue that the \"amounts of insurance\" has been \"in effect\" since 1995, when Ms. Lomma increased her coverage with Defendants from $25,000 to $100,000.\n   <em>\n    See\n   </em>\n   Doc. 30 at 5-9;\n   <em>\n    see also\n   </em>\n   Doc. 40 at 5-6 (Plaintiffs' brief in opposition to Defendants' motion for summary judgment arguing the same). Plaintiffs argue that at the very least, the first sentence renders the exclusion as a whole ambiguous, and due to Pennsylvania's principle that ambiguous insurance contracts should be \"construed strictly against the insurer,\" they are entitled to summary judgment in their favor.\n   <em>\n    Id.\n   </em>\n   at 9 (citing\n   <em>\n    East Coast Equipment Co. v.

Finally, in response to Defendants' criticism that this reading would render the second sentence superfluous, Plaintiffs argue that their \"interpretation does not render the second sentence of the suicide exclusion null.\" Doc. 40 at 5. Rather, \"[t]he second sentence can be interpreted to mean that\n   <em>\n    if\n   </em>\n   the suicide exclusion applies under the first sentence, the premiums paid will be refunded to the insured. Such an interpretation would not alter the fact that the suicide exclusion does not apply to the case at bar, because its applicability depends on when Ms. Lomma obtained $100,000.00 of insurance coverage.\"\n   <em>\n    Id.\n   </em>\n   at 5-6 (emphasis added).\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-42\">\n   In other words, both parties ask the Court to focus almost exclusively on one\n   sentence of the suicide exclusion while discounting the other. It is true that the key term in the second sentence, \"contract years,\" is defined in the policy. By contrast, the key term in the first sentence, \"amounts of insurance,\" is not defined. However, that does not necessitate ignoring the first sentence in favor of the second. First, while \"contract years\" is assigned a specific definition in the policy, the definition itself is not entirely clear. It states that contract years \"are marked from the\n   <em>\n    contract date\n   </em>\n   \" and that \"[t]his contract takes effect on the\n   <em>\n    contract date\n   </em>\n   shown on page 3.\" Replacement Policy at 11 (emphasis added). However, page 3 of the contract contains two dates, neither of which are labeled the \"contract date\". Instead, the page provides a \"Policy Date\" of August 10, 2007 and an \"Issue Date\" of August 15, 2007.\n   <em>\n    Id.\n   </em>\n   at 7. Thus, the definition of \"contract years\" is confusing at least to the extent that it depends on the term \"contract date\", which does not appear on page 3 of the contract, as the definition had suggested.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-43\">\n   More importantly, even if the term \"contract years\"\n   <em>\n    had\n   </em>\n   been clearly defined, its usage in the suicide exclusion still creates a latent ambiguity.

Thus, there is nothing in the exclusion to indicate that it is a specialized, defined term. Thus, given the fact that she had maintained a policy worth the same value with Defendants since 1995, Ms.\n   Lomma could have reasonably interpreted the term \"contract years\" to mean the duration of the contractual relationship between her and Defendants, rather than recognizing that it refers to a specifically defined term in the policy.

Had the Replacement Policy been the\n   <em>\n    first\n   </em>\n   contract that Ms. Lomma executed with Defendants, the exclusion could have no latent ambiguous effect.

First, they point to a section in the Replacement Policy called \"Illustration of Benefits,\" which provides certain caveats and information about the policy, including the following provision:\n  </p>\n  <blockquote id=\"p-48\">\n   Death benefit is the amount payable upon death as of the end of the policy year. However, this amount may not be payable if death is due to an excluded cause such as suicide during the first two years.\n  </blockquote>\n  <p id=\"p-49\">\n   Replacement Policy at 32. Second, Defendants point out that at the time Ms. Lomma switched to the Replacement Policy, she was provided a Notice stating: \"under your existing policy [i.e. the Original Policy], the period of time during which the issuing company could ... deny coverage for death caused by suicide, may have expired or may expire earlier than it will under the proposed policy.\" Doc. 31-3 at 39. Defendants argue that the Illustration of Benefits and the Notice expressed the possibility that the Original Policy may have been more advantageous to Ms. Lomma, since the insurer's time to contest coverage pursuant to the suicide exclusion may have expired.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-50\">\n   However, the Illustration of Benefits and the Notice are not dispositive because both contain qualifying, conditional language. Both texts are couched in words such as \"could,\" \"may not,\" and \"may have,\" rendering the statements to be of limited use to a reasonable insurance purchaser. The Illustration of Benefits merely references suicide as an example of \"excluded causes\" under which benefits \"may not be payable.\" Replacement Policy at 32. It does not provide any definitive language about the application of the suicide exclusion, nor does it point the reader to the relevant page containing the exclusion. Further, its usage of the phrase \"suicide during the first two years\" is even less clear than the suicide exclusion's language, which used the defined term \"contract years\" in its second sentence. The Illustration of Benefits, by contrast, does not use a defined term, nor does it provide a date from which the \"first two years\" would begin to run.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-51\">\n   The Notice contains similarly conditional language. It states that \"the period of time during which the issuing company could ... deny coverage for death caused by suicide, may have expired or may expire earlier than it will under the proposed policy.\" Doc. 31-3 at 39. Defendants, as both the existing and replacement insurer, were in the better position to inform Ms. Lomma that the suicide exclusion in the Original Policy would in fact be nullified, not, as the Notice states, \"may have expired or may expire earlier than it will under the proposed policy.\"\n   <em>\n    <extracted-citation case-ids=\"706475,7866588\" index=\"69\" url=\"https://cite.case.law/a2d/647/587/\">\n     Id.\n    </extracted-citation>\n   </em>\n   This qualified language does not conclusively compel the reading that the suicide exclusion period started anew in 2007. Because a preexisting long-term contractual relationship existed between the parties, the suicide exclusion's second sentence contains a latent ambiguity. Under Pennsylvania's well-established principle that any ambiguities in an insurance policy \"should be construed in favor of the insured and against the insurer, the drafter of the agreement,\" the latent ambiguity of the suicide exclusion should be resolved in favor of Plaintiffs.\n   <em>\n    Moessner\n   </em>\n   ,\n   <extracted-citation case-ids=\"285152\" index=\"70\" url=\"https://cite.case.law/f3d/121/895/#p905\">\n    121 F.3d at 900-01\n   </extracted-citation>\n   .\n   <em>\n    See also\n   </em>\n   <em>\n    DiFabio v.

Because the Original Policy and the Replacement Policy provided continuous coverage for Ms. Lomma's life, both of which had the same amount of insurance value and were obtained from the same insurer, it is reasonable to expect that the suicide exclusion expired two years after Ms. Lomma began maintaining a policy worth $100,000. As the drafter of both policies, Defendants could have drafted a clearer provision stating that the exclusion's expiration period is not measured by when the \"amounts of insurance\" have been in effect, but by the\n   <em>\n    most recent\n   </em>\n   contract's issuance date. Instead, Defendants have created an ambiguous provision that alludes to two distinct time periods: when the \"amounts of insurance [ ] have been in effect for less than 2 years\" and when the insured commits suicide \"within the first 2 contract years.\" Replacement Policy, at 13.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-54\">\n   As the Court's motion to dismiss opinion noted, \"the language in the suicide exclusion ... is anything but a 'standard' suicide exclusion. Many key dates necessary to both provide notice to Ms. Lomma and aid in the Court's interpretation are not referenced in the suicide exclusion.\" Doc. 24 at 33. \"Unlike every [other] suicide exclusion the Court has reviewed, the first sentence of the suicide exclusion in the Replacement Policy neither defines nor bases its applicability on the 'Date of Issue,' the 'Effective Date,' or some expressly defined date in the policy.\"\n   <em>\n    <extracted-citation case-ids=\"4063712\" index=\"78\" url=\"https://cite.case.law/f-supp-3d/54/354/#p362\">\n     Id.\n    </extracted-citation>\n   </em>\n   at 34 n. 8 (collecting cases where the suicide exclusions were exclusively defined by a specific, defined term such as \"Date of Issue shown in the Schedule,\" \"Issue Date,\" or \"Effective Date\"). The suicide exclusion in this case, by contrast, refers to two different time periods in two successive sentences. Moreover, it does not provide a conjunction or other clarifying language to indicate whether the provision is describing two distinct situations, each of which could independently operate to preclude coverage, or describing a single scenario under which coverage would be precluded.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-55\">\n   As discussed above, the extrinsic evidence to the contract is of little help in resolving the ambiguity. The Notice signed by Ms. Lomma at the time of the policy switch does not render the suicide exclusion unambiguous because it uses conditional and qualified language. Further, the extrinsic evidence does not clarify the latent ambiguity created by the exclusion-namely, its reference to \"contract years,\" while a defined term, does not indicate how \"contract years\" should be measured in the context of a preexisting relationship between the parties involving continuous policies covering the same \"amounts of insurance.\" Thus, the exclusion, both in isolation and in the context of extrinsic documents such as the Notice, can be reasonably interpreted to mean that Defendants intended to pay full benefits to Plaintiffs as long as the insured's suicide occurred two years after the amounts of insurance had been in effect. In light of the contractual relationship between her and Defendants, Ms. Lomma could have reasonably expected that the policy would grant full coverage to her beneficiaries because the suicide exclusion only imposed a two-year period from the time she first acquired the \"amounts of insurance\" in question. \"The goal of interpreting an insurance policy, like that of interpreting any other contract, is to determine the intent of the parties.\"\n   <em>\n    Meyer v.

In other words, Plaintiffs do not challenge or even mention Defendants' investigative process before denying the claim. Instead, their sole contention is that Defendants acted in bad faith because they relied on an interpretation more favorable to themselves when interpreting an ambiguous exclusion. But there is nothing nefarious about relying on a plausible interpretation of an ambiguous exclusion to deny coverage. As discussed above, the suicide exclusion is ambiguous, even when viewed in the totality of the insurance transaction involved. The Court cannot say that Defendants' denial of the benefits based on their interpretation of the exclusion was so unreasonable that it amounts to bad faith. An insurer's denial of benefits based on a plausible interpretation of an ambiguous contract, standing alone, is not sufficient to support a finding of bad faith by the Defendants.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-67\">\n   In this case, Plaintiffs have not challenged any aspect of Defendants' investigative process. As stated above, Defendants conducted an investigation within three months of first receiving notice of Ms. Lomma's death, and explained its reasoning and reliance on the suicide exclusion in their letter to Mr. Lomma.\n   <em>\n    See\n   </em>\n   Doc. 31-3 at 36 (August 31, 2009 Letter informing Mr. Lomma that Defendants would only pay the Lommas \"$285.12 plus interest at 4.5%\" because Ms. Lomma's death certificate indicated that she died by \"suicide\" and that, in accordance with the policy's suicide exclusion, \"the death proceeds for death due to 'Suicide' within the first two contract years is a refund of premiums paid\"). \"Bad faith is a\n   <em>\n    frivolous or unfounded\n   </em>\n   refusal to pay, lack of investigation into the facts, or a failure to communicate with the insured.\"\n   <em>\n    Frog, Switch &amp; Mfg.

None of those conditions for bad faith are borne by the evidence in this case. Plaintiffs have failed to point to any evidence that Defendants acted unreasonably in the way they handled Plaintiffs' claim.\n   <em>\n    See, e.g.,\n   </em>\n   <em>\n    Bodnar\n   </em>\n   ,\n   <extracted-citation index=\"105\" url=\"https://cite.case.law/citations/?q=660%20Fed.%20Appx.%20165\">\n    660 Fed.Appx. at 167\n   </extracted-citation>\n   (finding that insurer did not act in bad faith in its investigation and noting that \"Nationwide evaluated Bodnar's claim, consulted with legal counsel, and tried to determine whether Berry was an employee or a temporary worker\").

Pennsylvania law, as decided by the Pennsylvania Supreme Court and predicted by courts in this Circuit, is not consistent on this issue.\" Doc. 24 at 39 n. 11 (collecting cases applying either the \"clear and convincing\" standard or the \"preponderance of the evidence\" standard). Without predicting which standard the Pennsylvania Supreme Court will ultimately endorse, the Court will proceed under the heavier burden of proof, i.e. the \"clear and convincing evidence\" standard.\n    <em>\n     See\n    </em>\n    <em>\n     West v.

Imposing the heavier burden of proof on the insurer's affirmative defense would be the consistent with Pennsylvania's principles of construing insurance policies in favor of the insured and against the insurer.\n   </p>\n  </footnote>\n  <footnote label=\"4\">\n   <p id=\"p-77\">\n    As discussed above, while Defendants \"denied\" this assertion by clarifying that only Ohio National\n    <em>\n     Life Assurance\n    </em>\n    Corporation \"assumed\" the Original Policy, and that Defendant \"Ohio National\n    <em>\n     Life Insurance\n    </em>\n    Company was not involved in the transaction,\" they do not explain why this distinction is relevant to their arguments, and in fact refer to themselves jointly as \"Ohio National\" throughout their motion papers. Doc. 38 \u00b6 2 (emphasis added).
