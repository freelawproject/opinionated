BACKGROUND AND PROCEDURAL HISTORY\n    </em>\n   </strong>\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-11\">\n   A person convicted of a crime in Tennessee is typically made liable, to the government, for various sums of money related to his prosecution. Some of the defendant's debt may reflect fines imposed as part of his sentence, but Tennessee also holds a convicted defendant liable for additional, often substantial, amounts in the form of costs assessed against him and taxes imposed on litigants by the Tennessee General Assembly.\n   <em>\n    See\n   </em>\n   <extracted-citation index=\"0\" url=\"https://cite.case.law/citations/?q=Tenn.%20Code%20Ann.%20%C2%A7%2040-35-104\">\n    Tenn.

Code Ann. \u00a7 67-4-602\n   </extracted-citation>\n   (a). If the defendant does not pay these fines, costs, and litigation taxes-also known as \"court debt\"-then local authorities can attempt to collect on the debt using the ordinary tools available to judgment creditors, such as garnishment of wages or execution on property.\n   <extracted-citation index=\"3\" url=\"https://cite.case.law/citations/?q=Tenn.%20Code%20Ann.%20%C2%A7%2040-24-105\">\n    Tenn. Code Ann. \u00a7 40-24-105\n   </extracted-citation>\n   (a) ; Tenn. R. Civ. P. 69.05 - .07 ;\n   <em>\n    see\n   </em>\n   Tenn. Op. Att'y Gen. No. 06-135 (Aug. 21, 2006). Sometimes those tools may be effective; sometimes they may not. In particular, when a defendant has little or no income or assets, garnishment and execution will be of little use, because no tool is sufficient to collect from resources that do not exist. The fact that it is difficult to collect debts from very poor debtors is a reality faced by people and entities, both public and private, in a wide array of circumstances; indeed, it is a problem as old, presumably, as debt itself.\n   <footnotemark>\n    2\n   </footnotemark>\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-12\">\n   Failure to pay court debt, however, has consequences that failing to pay other debt does not. In particular, TDSHS, by statute, revokes the driver's license of any person who, like Thomas and Hixson, has failed to pay court debt for a year or more, unless that person is granted a form of discretionary relief by a court.\n   <em>\n    See\n   </em>\n   <extracted-citation index=\"4\" url=\"https://cite.case.law/citations/?q=Tenn.%20Code%20Ann.%20%C2%A7%2040-24-105\">\n    Tenn. Code Ann. \u00a7 40-24-105\n   </extracted-citation>\n   (b). The details of the plaintiffs' individual cases, as well as Tennessee's system for administering court debt, can be found in the First Memorandum. In short, Thomas and Hixson both live in severe poverty and both owe court debt related to past criminal convictions. Thomas is totally and permanently disabled. Hixson has spent time in recent years living in a homeless shelter after a period of incarceration. Each man struggles to afford the basic necessities of life and is unable to pay the court debt assessed against him. Because they failed to pay their court debt for over a year, Thomas and Hixson have both had their driver's licenses revoked by TDSHS.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-13\">\n   In contrast, a Tennessee driver with a criminal record identical to Thomas's or Hixson's-but with the material resources to pay his court debt-could have avoided revocation simply by making the payments that the plaintiffs cannot. The plaintiffs\n   have challenged this scheme-not because they believe that they should be released from the debt that they owe or because they dispute the government's right to impose aggressive sanctions on those who owe court debt that they can but refuse to pay-but because Tennessee's system has the actual effect of imposing a harsher punishment on indigent defendants than on non-indigent defendants based solely on their economic circumstances. A non-indigent defendant has a choice: pay or lose his license. Drivers like Thomas and Hixson, they argue, have no such choice. The plaintiffs challenge this differential treatment as unconstitutional pursuant to\n   <extracted-citation index=\"5\" url=\"https://cite.case.law/citations/?q=42%20U.S.C.%20%C2%A7%201983\">\n    42 U.S.C. \u00a7 1983\n   </extracted-citation>\n   .\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-14\">\n   Thomas and Hixson filed their class action Complaint on January 4, 2017. (Docket No. 1.) Shortly thereafter, they filed a motion asking the court to certify a class defined as follows:\n  </p>\n  <blockquote id=\"p-15\">\n   All persons whose Tennessee driver's licenses have been or will be revoked pursuant to\n   <extracted-citation index=\"6\" url=\"https://cite.case.law/citations/?q=Tenn.%20Code%20Ann.%20%C2%A7%2040-24-105\">\n    Tenn. Code Ann. \u00a7 40-24-105\n   </extracted-citation>\n   (b), and who, at the time of the revocation, cannot or could not pay Court Debt due to their financial circumstances.\n  </blockquote>\n  <p id=\"p-16\">\n   (Docket No. 6 at 2.) The court granted that motion on March 26, 2018, and Thomas and Hixson now represent a statewide class of similarly situated plaintiffs. (Docket No. 94.) That class challenges the constitutionality of Tennessee's court debt-based revocation scheme on three grounds: first, for violation of criminal defendants' due process and equal protection rights by the \"mandatory revocation of people's driver's licenses because they are too poor to pay Court Debt without any inquiry into their ability to pay\" (Docket No. 1 \u00b6 100); second, for violation of their due process right to notice and a hearing on whether they can pay their court debt (\n   <em>\n    Id.\n   </em>\n   \u00b6 101); and, third, for violation of equal protection based on Tennessee's policy of revoking the licenses of court debtors and not other similarly situated debtors (\n   <em>\n    Id.\n   </em>\n   \u00b6 102). Purkey filed a Motion to Dismiss (Docket No. 23) and a Motion for Summary Judgment (Docket No. 61), arguing that (1) the court was barred from considering the plaintiffs' claims under the\n   <em>\n    Rooker\n   </em>\n   <em>\n    -\n   </em>\n   <em>\n    Feldman\n   </em>\n   doctrine and (2) Purkey was entitled to summary judgment on the merits. The plaintiffs also filed a Motion for Summary Judgment. (Docket No. 37.) In the First Memorandum and the accompanying Order, the court denied the Motion to Dismiss, resolved most of the issues underlying the Motions for Summary Judgment, and ordered supplemental briefing on a few outstanding evidentiary matters. (Docket Nos. 93 &amp; 94.) That briefing having been completed, the court is prepared to rule on whether either party is entitled to summary judgment.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-17\">\n   <strong>\n    <em>\n     II. LEGAL STANDARD\n    </em>\n   </strong>\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-18\">\n   Rule 56 requires the court to grant a motion for summary judgment if \"the movant shows that there is no genuine dispute as to any material fact and the movant is entitled to judgment as a matter of law.\" Fed. R. Civ. P. 56(a). To win summary judgment as to the claim of an adverse party, a moving defendant must show that there is no genuine issue of material fact as to at least one essential element of the plaintiff's claim. Once the moving defendant makes his initial showing, the burden shifts to the plaintiff to provide evidence beyond the pleadings, \"set[ting] forth specific facts showing that there is a genuine issue for trial.\"\n   <em>\n    Moldowan v.

Under the\n   <em>\n    Griffin\n   </em>\n   line of cases, however, the court must specifically consider whether the scheme's lack of an indigence exception is itself rational.

(\n   <em>\n    Id.\n   </em>\n   at 37.) The numbers bear that ineffectiveness out. From July 1, 2012, to June 1, 2016, TDSHS revoked 146,211 driver's licenses for failure to pay fines, costs and/or litigation taxes; only 10,750 of those people-about 7%-had their licenses reinstated.

Ultimately, the court need not determine if the driver's license revocation law would fail rational basis review based on its sheer ineffectiveness alone, because, as applied to indigent drivers, the law is not merely ineffective; it is powerfully counterproductive. If a person has no resources to pay a debt, he cannot be threatened or cajoled into paying it; he may,\n   however, become able to pay it in the future. But taking his driver's license away sabotages that prospect. For one thing, the lack of a driver's license substantially limits one's ability to obtain and maintain employment. Even aside from the effect on employment, however, the inability to drive introduces new obstacles, risks, and costs to a wide array of life activities, as the former driver is forced into a daily ordeal of logistical triage to compensate for his inadequate transportation. In short, losing one's driver's license simultaneously makes the burdens of life more expensive and renders the prospect of amassing the resources needed to overcome those burdens more remote. (\n   <em>\n    Id.\n   </em>\n   at 39-41, 47-51.)\n  </blockquote>\n  <blockquote id=\"p-33\">\n   10. Because driving is necessary for so many important life activities, some Tennesseans whose licenses have been revoked continue to drive, despite the state's revocation of their privileges. Driving on a revoked license is a misdemeanor, punishable by up to six months in jail and a fine of up to $500 for the first offense and up to 11 months and 29 days in jail and a fine of up to $2,500 for subsequent offenses.\n   <extracted-citation index=\"74\" url=\"https://cite.case.law/citations/?q=Tenn.%20Code%20Ann.%20%C2%A7%C2%A7%2040-35-111\">\n    Tenn.

As a result, a license revocation based on court debt from a single conviction may begin a cycle of subsequent convictions and mounting court debt that renders the driver increasingly unable to amass the resources necessary to get his license back. His first conviction-of trespass, for example, like Thomas's-creates a court debt; that debt leads to a license revocation; the revocation leads to another conviction, this time for driving on a revoked license; the new conviction creates more debt; and the cycle begins again, with the driver, who was already indigent, only deeper in the red to the government and less likely ever to have a driver's license again. This propensity to create a debt spiral further exacerbates the counterproductive nature of Tennessee's scheme, as applied to indigent drivers. Not only is the law ineffective at collecting debt; not only is it counterproductive with regard to existing debt; but, in at least some cases, it affirmatively leaves\n   <em>\n    more\n   </em>\n   unpayable debt in its wake.

Some were based on tabulations of census data, while others cited to a 2011 Brookings Institution report entitled\n   <em>\n    Missed Opportunity: Transit and Jobs in Metropolitan America\n   </em>\n   (\"Brookings Report\"). Purkey responded to these facts, not by conceding them or citing to portions of the record showing them to be disputed, but simply by objecting to them on evidentiary grounds. As the court explained\n   in the First Memorandum, Purkey's responses (1) were premised on a misunderstanding of the movant's admissibility burden under Federal Rule of Civil Procedure 56(c)(1)-(2), which considers the admissibility of a fact at trial, not merely the admissibility of it in the form presented at the motion stage, and (2) arguably failed to conform to Local Rule 56.01(c), because Purkey did not indicate whether he actually disputed the facts and did not cite to the record in support of his responses.

The possibility of workers suffering lengthy commuting times due to their revocations is relevant to the plaintiffs' constitutional theory, but drawing a particular line between what would be a reasonable commute and what would not is simply adding a layer of formality and complexity where none is necessary.\n   <em>\n    Cf.\n   </em>\n   <em>\n    Reese v.

The constitutional theories on which the plaintiffs rely do not require any particular finding about what is or is not a reasonable commute, and, indeed, it is not altogether clear what \"reasonableness,\" as a factual matter, would mean here. Tomer Conclusion 1, therefore, is not material under Rule 56, and the court is not required to otherwise consider its admissibility.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-72\">\n   <strong>\n    Tomer Conclusion 2.\n   </strong>\n   The second statement that the plaintiffs have offered differs from what Purkey has conceded only in referring to public transit's being \"insufficient as a practical matter ... to\n   travel to and from work in a reasonable amount of time\" as opposed to \"inconvenient as a practical matter.\" This slight difference in wording, however, has no bearing on the court's analysis. The court has already taken ample judicial notice of the limitations of public transportation in Tennessee, and there is no need to turn to an expert to realize that, at some point, inconvenience reaches a level where it becomes tantamount to insufficiency. Where that line should be drawn is, like the question of what constitutes a \"reasonable\" commute, too abstract and undefined an inquiry to bear on the fundamental constitutional questions presented here. The court, accordingly, will disregard Tomer Conclusion 2, as well, as immaterial.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-73\">\n   <strong>\n    Tomer Conclusion 3.\n   </strong>\n   The plaintiffs' third assertion builds on the first's discussion of the reasonableness of a 90-minute commute. In this instance, however, the plaintiffs have offered more than an assertion of reasonableness for its own sake: \"In Memphis, Nashville, and Knoxville, 72% to 75% of jobs are not reasonably accessible by public transportation.\" Here, then, the discussion of reasonableness serves a particular descriptive purpose:\n  </p>\n  <blockquote id=\"p-74\">\n   In establishing our model and presenting our data, we used 90 minutes as the cutoff for a \"reasonable\" amount of time for a one-way commute to work. Or, to put it differently, if an individual could not get to work via transit in an overall time (including, e.g., walking from the bus stop to the office) of 90 minutes or less, we counted that individual as not having a job that was \"reasonably available via transit\" from where s/he lived.\n  </blockquote>\n  <p id=\"p-75\">\n   (Docket No. 108-3 \u00b6 10.) While the court does not need to accept Tomer's premise that 90 minutes demarcates a reasonable commute from an unreasonable one, Tomer's explanation does allow the court to consider Tomer Conclusion 3 in terms of its purely factual content. Specifically, Conclusion 3 can simply be reformulated to claim that \"[i]n Memphis, Nashville, and Knoxville, 72% to 75% of jobs are not [accessible within 90 minutes] by public transportation.\" That assertion plainly meets the threshold of materiality, while avoiding an immaterial and unnecessary detour down the path of defining what is reasonable.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-76\">\n   Purkey objects to the court's consideration of the Tomer Conclusions, first, by reiterating that the Brookings Report is hearsay. As the court held in the First Memorandum, however, the question is not whether the Brookings Report, as a document, is hearsay-which it undisputedly is-but whether facts derived from its underlying analysis can be presented in admissible form in this case. Although the Report is not admissible, it also is no bar to Tomer's testifying to what he learned during the process of its creation. A fact that appears as hearsay in one document is not somehow barred from ever being uttered again. Moreover, while it is true that many of the facts in the Tomer Declaration are based on Tomer's review of documents that would, themselves, be hearsay, an expert's reliance on otherwise inadmissible facts is expressly permitted by the Rules of Evidence as long as \"experts in [the witness's] particular field would reasonably rely on those kinds of facts or data in forming an opinion.\" Fed. R. Evid. 703.\n   <footnotemark>\n    5\n   </footnotemark>\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-77\">\n   Purkey objects to the Tomer Declaration itself as untimely under Federal Rule of Civil Procedure 6(c)(2), which requires that \"[a]ny affidavit supporting a motion must be served with the motion.\" The more specific provisions of Rule 56, however, expressly contemplate that a court may grant a party the chance to supplement the record in support of a fact offered pursuant to a summary judgment motion:\n  </p>\n  <blockquote id=\"p-78\">\n   (e) Failing to Properly Support or Address a Fact. If a party fails to properly support an assertion of fact or fails to properly address another party's assertion of fact as required by Rule 56(c), the court may:\n  </blockquote>\n  <blockquote id=\"p-79\">\n   (1) give an opportunity to properly support or address the fact;\n  </blockquote>\n  <blockquote id=\"p-80\">\n   (2) consider the fact undisputed for purposes of the motion;\n  </blockquote>\n  <blockquote id=\"p-81\">\n   (3) grant summary judgment if the motion and supporting materials-including the facts considered undisputed-show that the movant is entitled to it; or\n  </blockquote>\n  <blockquote id=\"p-82\">\n   (4) issue any other appropriate order.\n  </blockquote>\n  <p id=\"p-83\">\n   The plaintiffs' offering of the Tomer Declaration was in direct response to an order of the court. Purkey has provided no basis for concluding that the court's broad power to address unresolved factual issues pursuant to Rule 56 is somehow negated by the general provisions of Rule 6(c)(2). The plaintiffs' introduction of the Tomer Declaration, therefore, was timely.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-84\">\n   Finally, Purkey takes issue with the fact that the plaintiffs have only introduced a declaration from Tomer, but not from the other authors of the Brookings Report. Again, Purkey's focus on the Report\n   <em>\n    qua\n   </em>\n   Report misses what the plaintiffs are-and are not-seeking to put before the court. They are not seeking to introduce the entirety of the Report as admissible, undisputed evidence. They have asserted a few specific facts to which Tomer declares he is capable of testifying, based on his own individual knowledge. They have, moreover, provided biographical evidence of Tomer's substantial expertise in transit issues, and Purkey has identified no basis for doubting that Tomer would be a qualified expert at trial. There is simply no basis for requiring him to be accompanied by his colleagues in asserting facts to which he, personally, can attest.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-85\">\n   In the court's Order directing the parties to confer and, if necessary, submit supplemental briefing, the court strongly encouraged Purkey to lodge any factual objections he had to the plaintiffs' claims, even if he lodged evidentiary objections as well:\n  </p>\n  <blockquote id=\"p-86\">\n   If Purkey responds to any fact solely by raising evidentiary objections or objecting to the form of the plaintiffs' statement, the court will construe Purkey's response as relying solely on the stated objection to defeat the court's reliance on the fact asserted and will take the veracity of the fact as conceded pursuant to Local R. 56.01(g).\n  </blockquote>\n  <p id=\"p-87\">\n   (Docket No. 94 at 3.) Purkey has not disputed Tomer Conclusion 3 on any factual grounds, choosing, instead, to stand solely on his evidentiary objections. Because those objections fail, the court will take it to be conceded that, in Memphis, Nashville, and Knoxville, 72% to 75% of jobs are not accessible by public transportation within 90 minutes.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-88\">\n   <strong>\n    Tomer Conclusion 4.\n   </strong>\n   Purkey's response to Tomer Conclusion 4 is essentially the same as to Tomer Conclusion 3; he focuses almost entirely on the admissibility of the Brookings Report itself, despite the plaintiffs' having conceded that inadmissibility and proffered a flesh-and-blood witness in support of their proffered facts. Accordingly, the court will also take it as conceded\n   that, in Nashville, Knoxville, and Chattanooga, more than two thirds of working-age residents lack access to public transportation.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-89\">\n   <strong>\n    <em>\n     C. Counts I &amp; III: Tennessee's Revocation Scheme Does Not Survive Rational Basis Review\n    </em>\n   </strong>\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-90\">\n   The court has already held that revoking the driver's licenses of indigent court debtors appears to be counterproductive to the legitimate purpose of collecting on the underlying debt, and that, at some point, a policy becomes so manifestly counterproductive that it fails even the deferential standard of rational basis review. The only outstanding question is whether the undisputed facts show that that is the case here. In light, in particular, of the now-conceded census tabulations suggesting that 92% or more of the workers in each of the state's major metropolitan areas drive to work, the court concludes that the plaintiffs have met their burden.\n   <footnotemark>\n    6\n   </footnotemark>\n   Life in Tennessee is a prime example of the fact that, as the Supreme Court has observed, \"driving an automobile [is] a virtual necessity for most Americans.\"\n   <em>\n    Wooley v.

There is simply no room to doubt that losing the right to drive imposes a major economic hardship on a Tennessean, particularly if he is already indigent.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-91\">\n   There is nothing inherently unconstitutional about imposing a harsh sanction, of course, as long as the government has a rational basis for doing so. Accordingly, nothing about the court's ruling suggests that Tennessee cannot revoke a person's license because he drove dangerously or showed himself to be incompetent behind the wheel.\n   <em>\n    See\n   </em>\n   <extracted-citation index=\"94\" url=\"https://cite.case.law/citations/?q=Tenn.%20Code%20Ann.%20%C2%A7%2055-50-501\">\n    Tenn. Code Ann. \u00a7 55-50-501\n   </extracted-citation>\n   (a)(1), (3), (6). Nothing suggests that the state cannot revoke a license because a person drove drunk.\n   <em>\n    See\n   </em>\n   <extracted-citation index=\"95\" url=\"https://cite.case.law/citations/?q=Tenn.%20Code%20Ann.%20%C2%A7%2055-50-501\">\n    Tenn. Code Ann. \u00a7 55-50-501\n   </extracted-citation>\n   (a)(2). Those are rational reasons to take a person's driving privileges away. Collecting debt from an indigent debtor, on the other hand, is simply not a rational basis for revoking a license. No rational creditor wants his debtor to be sidelined from productive economic life. No rational creditor wants his debtor to be less able to hold a job or cover his other, competing living expenses. A rational creditor might want the benefit of the threat of a license revocation, but nothing that the plaintiffs have argued would deny the state that threat. The state can still use the specter of revocation to encourage payment of court debt; it simply must afford the debtor the opportunity to demonstrate, first, that the only reason he has failed to pay is that he simply cannot.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-92\">\n   Purkey or local authorities may complain that there is some expense associated with affording a debtor the opportunity to demonstrate his indigence. That is true, but it is no more true than in any of the other situations covered by the\n   <em>\n    Griffin\n   </em>\n   cases. The need to determine the indigence of court debtors, moreover, would fit into a preexisting system where such determinations are wholly routine.

As the court explained in the First Memorandum, there is every reason to think that a large number of the individuals who face revocation under section 40-24-105(b) are indigent. (First Memorandum at 72.) Affording a debtor the opportunity to establish his indigence prior to revocation, therefore, is likely necessary to avoid a large number of erroneous deprivations. Because section 40-24-105(b) revocations are not safety-related, moreover, the government has relatively little interest in avoiding the slight delay necessary for such a process.\n   <em>\n    See\n   </em>\n   <em>\n    Dixon\n   </em>\n   ,\n   <extracted-citation case-ids=\"2000\" index=\"154\" url=\"https://cite.case.law/us/431/105/#p115\">\n    431 U.S. at 114-15\n   </extracted-citation>\n   ,\n   <extracted-citation case-ids=\"2000\" index=\"155\" url=\"https://cite.case.law/us/431/105/#p115\">\n    97 S.Ct. 1723\n   </extracted-citation>\n   (emphasizing importance of safety rationale in holding that post-deprivation hearings are sufficient). Indeed, a purely post-deprivation indigence process might create a greater administrative burden, because it would require TDSHS to quickly reverse many revocations shortly after they were imposed-whereas a pre-deprivation determination would allow TDSHS to avoid performing unwarranted revocations altogether.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-105\">\n   Governments have identified a wide array of mechanisms through which such determinations might be made.

Some such drivers may face other revocations or suspensions on other grounds. Others may simply be overdue for a license renewal. At this stage, moreover, the court simply lacks a record regarding the process of identifying the affected drivers, lifting their revocations, and allowing them to receive their licenses again.

(\n   <em>\n    See\n   </em>\n   Docket No. 40 \u00b6 43.) By statute, TDSHS revokes the driver's license of any person who, like Thomas and Hixson, has\n   failed to pay those fines, costs, or litigation taxes for a year or more, unless that person is granted a form of discretionary relief by a court.\n   <em>\n    See\n   </em>\n   <extracted-citation index=\"164\" url=\"https://cite.case.law/citations/?q=Tenn.%20Code%20Ann.%20%C2%A7%2040-24-105\">\n    Tenn. Code Ann. \u00a7 40-24-105\n   </extracted-citation>\n   (b). Thomas and Hixson sue on behalf of themselves and a not fully known number of similarly situated Tennesseans who, they argue, have had their right to drive taken away solely based on the fact that they are indigent and therefore cannot pay the fines, costs, and litigation taxes imposed on them.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-132\">\n   <strong>\n    <em>\n     A. \"Court Debt\"\n    </em>\n   </strong>\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-133\">\n   Thomas and Hixson characterize this case as about \"court debt,\" a somewhat opaque term that does not itself appear in any of the statutes at issue. Although Purkey takes particular issue with the term, the specific terminology that one uses to discuss the issue is of fairly little importance. A person who passes through the criminal justice system may incur a number of different payment obligations, assessed in different amounts for different reasons, and \"court debt\" is merely a shorthand for the particular payment obligations at issue here. For the purposes of this opinion, \"court debt\" will refer to fines, costs, and litigation taxes assessed against a defendant who either (1) pleads guilty to a misdemeanor or felony, (2) is convicted of a misdemeanor or felony following trial, or (3) agrees to incur liability for fines, costs and/or litigation taxes based on an agreement with a prosecutor for the charges brought against the defendant to be dismissed \"on costs.\" (\n   <em>\n    See\n   </em>\n   Docket No. 64 \u00b6 9.)\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-134\">\n   <strong>\n    <em>\n     <em>\n      1.

Purkey admits, for summary judgment purposes, that Thomas \"currently survives on very limited subsistence income for people who are totally and permanently disabled\" and \"cannot afford to pay the $289.70 in Court Debt, the $65 reinstatement fee, and the additional application fee necessary to regain his driving privileges.\" (\n   <em>\n    Id.\n   </em>\n   \u00b6 71.)\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-183\">\n   <strong>\n    <em>\n     <em>\n      2.

(\n   <em>\n    Id.\n   </em>\n   \u00b6\u00b6 74-76.)

TDSHS revocation notice letters appear to have been generated and issued for Hixson on two occasions (Docket Nos. 62-6 &amp; -7), although Purkey concedes, for purposes of summary judgment, that Hixson never received those letters (Docket No. 89 \u00b6 10).\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-185\">\n   Hixson now works part-time as a vehicle emissions inspector, but he struggles to afford basic necessities.

Neither Thomas nor Hixson argues that Tennessee state courts committed error either in entering their convictions or in assessing fines, costs, or litigation taxes against them.

Thomas and Hixson seek only one thing: that the state not take away their lawful ability to drive based on the fact that they cannot currently pay the amounts they owe. Their challenge is to one inherently post-judgment coercive tool used in the state's collection regime-not to any judgment itself.\n   <footnotemark>\n    4\n   </footnotemark>\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-209\">\n   To bolster his\n   <em>\n    Rooker\n   </em>\n   <em>\n    -\n   </em>\n   <em>\n    Feldman\n   </em>\n   argument, Purkey points to the various statutory bases pursuant to which an individual facing court debt can ask a relevant court, within its discretion, for some form of relief from his debt or some consideration of his indigency.\n   <em>\n    See\n   </em>\n   <extracted-citation index=\"316\" url=\"https://cite.case.law/citations/?q=Tenn.%20Code%20Ann.%20%C2%A7%C2%A7%2040\">\n    Tenn.

Thomas and Hixson are not challenging any judgment made pursuant to the cited statutes, nor are they even arguing that they are entitled to have fines, costs, or litigation taxes waived. Thomas and Hixson seek relief from one specific statutory consequence of their failure to pay-the revocation of their licenses-that took effect long after the fines, costs, or litigation taxes were imposed, based on a fact-their nonpayment after one year-that was not, nor could have been, adjudicated in the original criminal proceedings.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-210\">\n   Purkey argues, in essence, that as long as Tennessee state law permits the plaintiffs to raise the issue of their indigence to a court in some form, pursuant to some standard, then\n   <em>\n    Rooker\n   </em>\n   <em>\n    -\n   </em>\n   <em>\n    Feldman\n   </em>\n   wholly shields state and local agencies from any federal suit based on those agencies' actions related to nonpayment.

What Thomas and Hixson have raised is clearly a challenge to the operation of a supplemental statutory mechanism for seeking to coerce or encourage the payment of their debts-not any actual feature of the judgments against them or the debts in and of themselves. The court, accordingly, will not grant summary judgment or dismissal based on the\n   <em>\n    Rooker\n   </em>\n   <em>\n    -\n   </em>\n   <em>\n    Feldman\n   </em>\n   doctrine.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-211\">\n   <strong>\n    <em>\n     B.

Justice Black, writing the lead opinion, explained that, although Illinois' requirements, on their face, applied equally to all criminal appellants, their effect was \"to deny adequate appellate review to the poor while granting such review to all others,\" which, the full majority agreed, was impermissible under the Constitution.\n   <em>\n    Griffin\n   </em>\n   ,\n   <extracted-citation case-ids=\"1105068\" index=\"340\" url=\"https://cite.case.law/us/351/12/\">\n    351 U.S. at 13\n   </extracted-citation>\n   ,\n   <extracted-citation case-ids=\"1105068\" index=\"341\" url=\"https://cite.case.law/us/351/12/\">\n    76 S.Ct. 585\n   </extracted-citation>\n   .\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-216\">\n   There are aspects of the analysis in\n   <em>\n    Griffin\n   </em>\n   -though not, necessarily, its holding-that seem to pose a challenge in terms of reconciling the case with the rules that govern constitutional cases today.

Whatever principle is at work in\n   <em>\n    Griffin\n   </em>\n   , then, it is clearly less simple than determining whether access to courts or a risk of confinement is directly implicated, even if that distinction was sufficient to resolve the issue presented by\n   <em>\n    Johnson.\n   </em>\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-234\">\n   Ultimately, even the\n   <em>\n    Johnson\n   </em>\n   majority opinion concedes that more is going on in its talk of \"fundamental interests\" than a binary question of whether the statute at issue impinges on something that the courts have identified as a \"fundamental right\" under the Constitution. At one point, the\n   <em>\n    Johnson\n   </em>\n   court is called on to distinguish\n   <em>\n    James v.

The law at issue in that case, like this one, involved the collection of court-related debt from people who had faced criminal charges. The Court invalidated the\n   <em>\n    Strange\n   </em>\n   scheme under what appeared to be rational basis review, although the\n   <em>\n    Johnson\n   </em>\n   court construed the\n   <em>\n    Strange\n   </em>\n   opinion as having set a higher bar than was required for Tennessee's re-enfranchisement statute. The\n   <em>\n    Johnson\n   </em>\n   court, rather, concluded that the analysis in\n   <em>\n    Strange\n   </em>\n   did not apply to\n   <em>\n    Johnson\n   </em>\n   because\n   <em>\n    Strange\n   </em>\n   involved a scheme that, by further impoverishing already-indigent debtors, endangered \"the hopes of indigents for self-sufficiency and self-respect,\" whereas\n   <em>\n    Johnson\n   </em>\n   involved a \"mere 'statutory benefit.' \"\n   <em>\n    Johnson\n   </em>\n   ,\n   <extracted-citation case-ids=\"3795188\" index=\"426\" url=\"https://cite.case.law/f3d/624/742/#p749\">\n    624 F.3d at 749\n   </extracted-citation>\n   (quoting\n   <em>\n    Strange\n   </em>\n   ,\n   <extracted-citation case-ids=\"9136889\" index=\"427\" url=\"https://cite.case.law/us/407/128/\">\n    407 U.S. at 135\n   </extracted-citation>\n   ,\n   <extracted-citation case-ids=\"9136889\" index=\"428\" url=\"https://cite.case.law/us/407/128/\">\n    92 S.Ct. 2027\n   </extracted-citation>\n   ;\n   <em>\n    Harvey v.

Under\n   <em>\n    Johnson\n   </em>\n   then, an at least somewhat elevated version of rational basis review would seem to be required in a case where a scheme was alleged to discriminatorily endanger an indigent person's basic subsistence and capacity for self-sufficiency.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-236\">\n   The tiered system of scrutinies has its advantages and, for a large portion of constitutional cases, is sufficient to resolve the questions at hand. The problem is that this is one area of law where the Supreme Court has said, in no uncertain terms, that a different set of tools is called for. Ignoring those holdings in favor of a two-sizes-fit-all approach does not afford the Supreme Court's cases the precedential weight to which they are entitled. As much as Purkey may argue that the standard, tiered framework is inescapable and unbending, the reality is that the jurisprudence of the Supreme Court says otherwise. In\n   <em>\n    Bearden\n   </em>\n   and elsewhere, the Supreme Court has recognized that, in select areas, \"more is involved ... than the abstract question whether [the challenged law] discriminates against a suspect class, or whether [the matter at issue] is a fundamental right.\"\n   <em>\n    Plyler v.

While this court has no appetite for inventing new areas for departure from the standard framework, it also sees no ground for ignoring the exceptions that the Supreme Court has already established.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-237\">\n   <em>\n    <em>\n     c.

The Sixth Circuit has held that \"there is no fundamental right to drive a motor vehicle\" under the Constitution.\n   <em>\n    Duncan v.

At the same time, however, the court notes that, as the degree of the burden imposed increases, a scheme that hinges on taking away one's right to drive gets closer and closer to the rights to which the Constitution affords special protection. Moreover, as the court will discuss below, the right at issue here bears substantially on the debtor's interest in self-sufficiency, which the Sixth Circuit recognized, in\n   <em>\n    Johnson\n   </em>\n   , to justify an at least somewhat more searching standard of review.

Thomas and Hixson have previewed substantial evidence to that effect, much of which Purkey has objected to on evidentiary, rather than factual, grounds. Even solely on the basis of the undisputed facts and the basic features of life of which the court can take judicial notice, however, the substantial economic disadvantages associated with being unable lawfully to drive are apparent.\n   <footnotemark>\n    9\n   </footnotemark>\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-245\">\n   Most obviously, being unable to drive in Tennessee limits the jobs available to a person and makes holding a job difficult once the person has it. \"Automobile travel ... is a basic, pervasive, and often necessary mode of transportation to and from one's home [and] workplace.\"\n   <em>\n    Delaware v.

Some jobs require a person to drive as part of his duties, and even those jobs that do not themselves involve driving generally require the employee to be somewhere, reliably, on time.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-246\">\n   The damage that the lack of a driver's license does to one's employment prospects is just the beginning. Being unable to drive is the equivalent of a recurring tax or penalty on engaging in the wholly lawful ordinary activities of life-a tax or penalty that someone who was convicted of the same offense, but was able to pay his initial court debt, would never be obligated to pay. When the State of Tennessee takes away a person's right to drive, that person does not, suddenly and conveniently, stop having to go to medical appointments, stop having to report to court dates, or stop having to venture into the world to obtain food and necessities. Maybe public transportation will work for some of those activities some of the time, and maybe it will not. Purkey has offered nothing that would permit the court to conclude that public transportation can adequately fill the void left by the loss of a license, and indeed he stipulates, at a minimum, that \"[p]ublic transportation is not available in some parts of Tennessee.\"(Docket No. 40 \u00b6 42.) Similarly, while some individuals with revoked licenses may be able to rely on family or charitable assistance for some purposes, there is no reason to conclude that such options will be available or adequate in most cases. What, then, is a person on a revoked license to do? The lawful options are simple: he can simply forgo the life activities, no matter how important, for which he cannot obtain adequate transportation, or he can incur additional transportation expenses-making himself that much less likely ever to satisfy his court debt.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-247\">\n   Of course, an indigent person with a revoked license has another option, besides\n   accepting the practical limitations that the state has placed on him: he can, faced with the need to navigate the world and no feasible, affordable, and legal option for doing so, break the law and drive. The court very deliberately uses \"can\" here, not \"may\" or \"should,\" but it would simply be willful blindness to ignore the fact that some debtors with revoked licenses will be tempted to disregard the revocation, at least for pressing needs. By defying his license revocation, however, the indigent debtor puts himself at the risk of incurring more fines, more court costs, and more litigation taxes that will be likely to render the restoration of his rights an even more improbable proposition.\n   <em>\n    See\n   </em>\n   <extracted-citation index=\"480\" url=\"https://cite.case.law/citations/?q=Tenn.%20Code%20Ann.%20%C2%A7%C2%A7%2040-35-111\">\n    Tenn.

If the purpose of such a scheme were simply to lock indigent defendants into an endless cycle of greater and greater debt, it could be said to serve that purpose well. But Purkey, to his credit, does not assert that the State of Tennessee or his Department has any legitimate interest in building inescapable debt traps for indigent Tennesseans. Purkey, rather, claims that his Department's policies are in furtherance of debt collection. Toward that end, it is hard to say the policies are rationally calculated.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-248\">\n   Purkey may respond that rational basis review permits even arguably counterproductive policies a presumption of constitutionality. Nothing about the case law, however, suggests that the Constitution's tolerance for legislative or administrative self-sabotage is limitless.\n   <em>\n    Cf.\n   </em>\n   <em>\n    Cleveland Bd. of Educ. v.

There is reason to believe that taking away a driver's license is not merely out of proportion to the underlying purpose of ensuring payment, but affirmatively destructive of that end-so much so that whether section 40-24-105(b) can lay any claim to rationality is open to serious question.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-249\">\n   The court finds itself returning to the Sixth Circuit's reminder that, under rational basis review, a state is free to \"use[ ] a shotgun instead of a rifle to accomplish its legitimate end.\"\n   <extracted-citation case-ids=\"3795188\" index=\"489\" url=\"https://cite.case.law/f3d/624/742/#p749\">\n    624 F.3d at 748\n   </extracted-citation>\n   . The Sixth Circuit invoked that colorful aphorism to demonstrate that the state is free to resort to policies that are imprecise and overbroad. But the question unavoidably arises: Is it actually always rational to reach for the metaphorical shotgun, no matter the task at hand? This court previously suggested that taking a person's driver's license away to try to make him more likely to pay a fine is more like using a shotgun to treat a broken arm. Maybe it is more like using the shotgun to shoot oneself in the foot. However one wants to think about it, the aspect of the Sixth Circuit's metaphor that is easy to miss is that, while the state is not required to use the best tool for the job, it still has to use\n   <em>\n    a\n   </em>\n   tool for the job.

And the undisputed facts suggest that that longstanding, persistent inability usually continues after revocation. Purkey admits that, from July 1, 2012, to June 1, 2016, his agency revoked over 146,000 driver's licenses for failure to pay fines, costs and/or litigation taxes. It restored fewer than 11,000. (Docket No. 64 \u00b6\u00b6 107-08.) In other words, well over 92% of the people whose driver's licenses were revoked turned out not, in fact, to be people who could be coerced into payment. Can it really be said, then, that section 40-24-105(b) is a collection mechanism that, through its overbreadth, sweeps in some indigent people? The numbers would suggest that, to the contrary, taking away the driver's licenses of indigent people is the core of what the statute does.\n   <footnotemark>\n    10\n   </footnotemark>\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-252\">\n   Admittedly, the General Assembly has taken some recent steps to allow courts, in their discretion, to afford relief to defendants facing greater court debt than they can pay.

The\n   <em>\n    Griffin\n   </em>\n   line of cases does not simply guarantee indigent defendants, in the relevant situations, the opportunity to appeal generally to the broad discretion of their sentencing court to alleviate their burden.

Thomas and Hixson have set forth a sound theory of the constitutional protection to which they are entitled, based on longstanding Supreme Court precedents and well-recognized principles regarding the solicitude owed to indigent people in the criminal justice system. Whether that theory justifies the holding they seek, however, depends on the facts. Purkey reminds the court repeatedly-and correctly-that constitutional case law has recognized no fundamental right to drive a motor vehicle. Conceding as much, the plaintiffs have not framed their challenge as about the right to drive in the abstract, but about the practical effect of losing that right on other, sometimes profoundly important interests. Specifically, the plaintiffs argue that, in Tennessee, losing one's license has substantial destructive effects on both (1) a person's ability to obtain basic self-sufficiency and (2) the government's ability to recoup its debts. The court, therefore, must survey the undisputed facts before it to determine if the plaintiffs have so conclusively established that premise-or Purkey so conclusively refuted it-that summary judgment would be proper.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-259\">\n   <strong>\n    <em>\n     i.

As the court has already discussed, taking at least some judicial notice to that effect is proper. Rule 201 of the Federal Rules of Evidence permits a court, either by motion of a party or on its own motion, to \"judicially notice a fact that is not subject to reasonable dispute because it\" either \"(1) is generally known within the trial court's territorial jurisdiction; or (2) can be accurately and readily determined from sources whose accuracy cannot reasonably be questioned.\" Judicial notice permits a court to acknowledge certain indisputable foundational facts about life in a jurisdiction, such as the region's geography,\n   <em>\n    see\n   </em>\n   <em>\n    Tucker v.

The court notes, however, that no such deprivation of the chance to refute a judicially noticed fact has taken place here. Indeed, Purkey has been given ample opportunity to dispute the importance of driving to life in Tennessee, and, while he has raised a number of evidentiary objections, he has offered little to nothing that would undermine the plaintiffs' factual premise. For example, in their Statement of Undisputed Material Facts, Thomas and Hixson, citing third-party research, posit that, \"[i]n Memphis, Nashville, and Knoxville, 72% to 75% of jobs are not reasonably accessible by public transportation.\" (Docket No. 64 \u00b6 95.) Purkey, in response, objects on the basis of hearsay but does not deny the fact asserted. (\n   <em>\n    Id.\n   </em>\n   ) Thomas and Hixson add that, \"[i]n Nashville, Knoxville, and Chattanooga, more than two thirds of working-age residents lack access to public transportation.\" (\n   <em>\n    Id.\n   </em>\n   \u00b6 96.) Again, Purkey raises only a hearsay objection, with neither a denial of the plaintiffs' factual assertion nor any proffered reason to doubt its general accuracy. (\n   <em>\n    Id.\n   </em>\n   ) Thomas and Hixson then claim that \"93.4% of Tennessee residents drive to work.\" (\n   <em>\n    Id.\n   </em>\n   \u00b6 97.) This time, Purkey raises two evidentiary objections-but again, he makes no quarrel with the facts. (\n   <em>\n    Id.\n   </em>\n   ) This pattern continues for several pages, with Purkey objecting even to such undeniably common sense statements as \"Many indigent people who owe Court Debt and whose licenses have been revoked under the Statute still need to drive in order to get to work, school, or medical appointments.\" (\n   <em>\n    Id.\n   </em>\n   \u00b6 106;\n   <em>\n    see id.\n   </em>\n   \u00b6\u00b6 94-106.) Any factual basis for Purkey's resistance to the plaintiffs' positions, however, is conspicuously absent.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-263\">\n   None of this is to give short shrift to Purkey's evidentiary objections-which the court will address in more detail below-but to note that, if Purkey has any ground on which he actually disputes the importance of driving in Tennessee, he has had ample opportunity to raise it. Therefore, while the court will exercise the level of caution appropriate under Rule 201, it will do so while noting that Purkey and his counsel have certainly not been blindsided by this issue, nor have they been deprived of chances to make a case to the contrary.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-264\">\n   With the foregoing principles in mind, the court takes judicial notice of the following. First, the court judicially notices that the public transportation available in Tennessee is widely insufficient to provide an adequate substitute for access to private motor vehicle transportation. Second, the court judicially notices that the services, businesses, homes, and workplaces throughout Tennessee are so geographically diffuse that navigating life in the state wholly on foot is impracticable for all but perhaps a few Tennesseans. Third, the court judicially notices that a number of obstacles prevent non-motorized transportation, such as bicycles, from providing an adequate alternative to driving in Tennessee, including (1) the aforementioned geographically diffuse pattern of development; (2) the need to travel on interstates and highways; (3) safety concerns associated with using non-motorized travel in areas without paths dedicated to that purpose; (4) the lack of such dedicated paths on numerous important roads within the state; and (5) the fact that many Tennesseans face physical limitations that would not prevent them from driving but that would sharply limit their use of a bicycle or other human-powered mode of transportation.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-265\">\n   Based on its judicial notice of these aforementioned facts, the court concludes that it is beyond dispute that, at least as a general proposition, the cities, towns, and communities of Tennessee are pervasively\n   structured around the use of motor vehicles. Anyone who doubts that premise is welcome to attempt to run a day's worth of errands in a rural Tennessee county with no car and very little money. The centrality of motor vehicle travel is, moreover, not solely a rural problem. Even the relatively dense city of Nashville, where the court sits, is deeply reliant on motor vehicle transport. If any city in this jurisdiction could be expected to be reasonably navigable without driving, it would be Nashville-and the court takes judicial notice that, to the contrary, Nashville is a city where motor vehicle travel is an essential part of ordinary life, particularly for anyone seeking to maintain or build economic self-sufficiency.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-266\">\n   There are, of course, limits to what the court can judicially notice. The court cannot, for example, take judicial notice of the more specific statistical claims offered by Thomas and Hixson, nor can the court ascribe absolute universality to the general facts of which the court has taken judicial notice. There is no reason, however, for the court to engage in the preposterous fiction that the question of whether driving is central to life in Tennessee is shrouded in mystery. This is a state of roads, not footpaths-and those roads, for the most part, are filled with private and commercial vehicles, not bicycles and public buses. The court is permitted to acknowledge as much.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-267\">\n   <strong>\n    <em>\n     ii. Stipulations.\n    </em>\n   </strong>\n   Indeed, the parties' stipulations-though worded cautiously-support the court's conclusion. Purkey stipulates, for example, that, \"[f]or many adult residents of Tennessee, the ability to drive is an important aspect of daily life.\" (Docket No. 40 \u00b6 41.) He further stipulates that \"[p]ublic transportation is not available in some parts of Tennessee.\" (\n   <em>\n    Id.\n   </em>\n   \u00b6 42). Although those stipulations, in a vacuum, may be frustratingly vague and euphemistic, the court's permissible consideration of background facts about life in the state brings the agreed-upon premises more sharply into focus. No testimony is required for the court to understand that driving is \"an important aspect of daily life,\" because it is how Tennesseans get to work, school, supermarkets, doctors' offices, hospitals, religious services, job interviews, charitable organizations, polling places, and community activities, among other destinations. Nor is testimony required for the court to know that the \"some parts of Tennessee\" without public transportation include more than the bottom of the Cumberland River or the top of Mount Le Conte. The areas without public transportation, or with wholly inadequate public transportation, include the homes of many Tennesseans whose rights and desires to engage in the activities of life are no less than those of Tennesseans in the state's city centers. The parties' stipulations, accordingly, support a holding that the loss of one's driver's license works a substantial hardship on the former license holder's capacity for self-sufficiency, such that a license revocation would be counterproductive to fostering an indigent debtor's ability to pay his debts.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-268\">\n   <strong>\n    <em>\n     iii. Census Data and Brookings Institution Report.\n    </em>\n   </strong>\n   The stipulations and judicial notice available provide a great deal of support for the general conclusion that driving is central to everyday life and personal self-sufficiency in Tennessee. General conclusions, however, can only take the court so far. Thomas and Hixson have offered a number of more detailed supporting facts, to which Purkey objects primarily, if not exclusively, on evidentiary grounds. The court, therefore, must consider the degree to which it can consider those supporting facts on the motions for summary judgment.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-269\">\n   Thomas and Hixson have offered the declaration of one of their attorneys, Edward Krugman, purporting to authenticate and summarize supporting evidence from (1) a 2011 Brookings Institution report entitled\n   <em>\n    Missed Opportunity: Transit and Jobs in Metropolitan America\n   </em>\n   (\"Brookings Report\")\n   <footnotemark>\n    13\n   </footnotemark>\n   ; and (2) census data regarding the percentage of Tennessee residents who commute to work.\n   <footnotemark>\n    14\n   </footnotemark>\n   (Docket No. 43.) Purkey objects to both sources on the grounds that Krugman, as an attorney for the plaintiffs, is not an appropriate authenticating witness and that the Brookings Report and the census figures are hearsay.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-270\">\n   Purkey is correct that, insofar as there is a reasonable dispute about the authenticity or credibility of sources, a lawyer for one of the parties would not be an appropriate witness on the matter-at least if that lawyer also planned to appear at trial.\n   <em>\n    See\n   </em>\n   Tenn. Sup. Ct.

The court is capable of taking judicial notice of the fact that \"http://www.brookings.edu\" and \"http://www.census.gov\" are the URLs of, respectively, the Brookings Institution and the U.S. Census Bureau, and the sources that Krugman has cited are available on those websites.

Purkey is mistaken, however, that a hearsay objection is enough to categorically insulate him from addressing the facts at issue. Purkey relies on the Sixth Circuit's decision in\n   <em>\n    Sperle v.

Addressing evidentiary objections on summary judgment through such a procedure is frequently sufficient, either because the ultimate evidentiary issue at trial is obvious or because reliance on the specific fact at issue is unnecessary for resolution of the relevant motion. The pending summary judgment motions, however, do not yield such an easy resolution. Accordingly, the court is inclined to hold those motions in abeyance with regard to Count I, pending either (1) a more cooperative effort between the parties at reaching reasonable, agreed-upon stipulations regarding the underlying facts or (2) the filing of supplemental briefs on whether the facts cited by the plaintiffs and found in the Brookings Report, or some rough equivalent or substitute, can be presented in a form that would be admissible at trial.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-275\">\n   Thomas and Hixson do not, after all, ask the court to accept the entire Brookings Report,\n   <em>\n    in toto\n   </em>\n   , as indisputable. Rather, they identify a few simple aspects of the authors' conclusions-mostly straightforward statistical claims about Tennessee communities-that are relevant to this\n   case. (\n   <em>\n    See\n   </em>\n   Docket No. 64 \u00b6\u00b6 94-96.) The Brookings Report, in turn, is fairly transparent about its methodology, and many of the sources on which it relies are publicly available, such as transit authorities' own route and schedule information.\n   <em>\n    See\n   </em>\n   Brookings Report at 5-6, 29-34. It is not difficult, then, to foresee how the facts cited by the plaintiffs-or comparable facts conveying similarly supportive background information about specific Tennessee communities-could be admissible at trial, either through an author of the Brookings Report, if available, or some other knowledgeable witness. Accordingly, if the parties truly are unable to agree upon the facts necessary for full consideration of the plaintiffs' claims, the court will permit Thomas and Hixson to file supplemental affidavits and statements of undisputed fact establishing how, if at all, they would anticipate introducing specific factual support regarding the necessity of driving to Tennesseans.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-276\">\n   Further briefing may also be helpful on the census data as currently presented, if the parties are unable to agree on what that data says. With regard to the raw data itself, Purkey's hearsay objection is unavailing, because Rule 201 generally permits the court to take judicial notice of \"public records and government documents available from reliable sources on the Internet.\"\n   <em>\n    U.S. ex rel.

Mich. Feb. 23, 2011) (\"Publications of the U.S. Bureau of Census are self-authenticating....\"). Although parties might dispute the analysis of census figures or even the methodology by which a census was conducted, the court knows of no reasonable basis to dispute that the U.S. Census Bureau's published data is itself an accurate representation of the census or censuses taken.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-277\">\n   Thomas and Hixson, however, do not rely solely on the data in its raw form, but also on their compilation and tabulation of figures from that data to represent the percentages of residents in a number of Tennessee metropolitan areas who drive to work. (Docket No. 43 \u00b6\u00b6 6-10.) The plaintiffs argue that their tabulations are admissible under Rule 1006 of the Federal Rules of Evidence, which permits a party to use \"a summary, chart, or calculation to prove the content of voluminous writings, recordings, or photographs that cannot be conveniently examined in court.\" Alternatively, the plaintiffs suggest that their tabulations can be considered as a Rule 611(a) pedagogical device.\n   <em>\n    See\n   </em>\n   <em>\n    United States v. Bray\n   </em>\n   ,\n   <extracted-citation case-ids=\"11849043\" index=\"537\" url=\"https://cite.case.law/f3d/139/1104/#p1111\">\n    139 F.3d 1104\n   </extracted-citation>\n   , 1111 (6th Cir. 1998). Given the voluminous nature of the census data, it seems to the court that a Rule 1006 summary would be appropriate. \"[S]ummaries admitted as evidence under Rule 1006,\" however, \"must fairly represent and be taken from underlying documentary proof.\"\n   <em>\n    Gomez v. Great Lakes Steel Div., Nat. Steel Corp.\n   </em>\n   ,\n   <extracted-citation case-ids=\"1629625\" index=\"538\" url=\"https://cite.case.law/f2d/803/250/#p257\">\n    803 F.2d 250\n   </extracted-citation>\n   , 257 (6th Cir. 1986). The court's consideration of this matter would therefore be aided by Purkey's setting aside his evidentiary gamesmanship and weighing in on whether the plaintiffs' summary is accurate. In other words, the court invites Purkey to check the plaintiffs' math rather than looking for ways to avoid it. If, then, the parties are truly unable to reach an agreement regarding the plaintiffs' numbers, the court will require additional briefing on the degree to which the numbers presented in paragraph 10 of Krugman's declaration are admissible as a Rule 1006 summary or, in the alternative, a Rule 611(a) pedagogical\n   device. While Purkey is free to lodge or reiterate any evidentiary objections he likes, he will also be required to take an affirmative position on the accuracy of the plaintiffs' calculations, with an adequate and thorough explanation of any grounds for disputing those calculations, or risk the court's taking the plaintiffs' calculations as conceded. The plaintiffs, in turn, will be ordered to make good faith efforts to assist Purkey's counsel in understanding the plaintiffs' tabulation methodology.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-278\">\n   Counsel for the parties can, and presumably will, use their best litigation judgment regarding how to go about the stipulations and briefing ordered. The court notes, however, that it fails to see why any party would wish to draw these proceedings out by being intransigent or willfully obtuse about the basic fact that driving is a central part of ordinary life for most adult Tennesseans who are capable of operating a motor vehicle, particularly those who wish to be economically self-sufficient. The court has taken judicial notice of that fact generally, and it has little doubt that additional facts are discoverable and admissible that would provide more detailed support for the general proposition. It is difficult to imagine what would be gained by holding a trial solely for the purpose of hauling in witnesses to authenticate studies and confirm simple calculations, all to form an evidentiary record in support of a premise that any person who lives in Tennessee can see is true. It would seem to the court that resolving this case expeditiously would be better furthered by agreeing upon the basic, indisputable facts and focusing on the area of the parties' actual meaningful disagreement: the substance of the governing constitutional law. In any event, for the aforementioned reasons, the court will hold the parties' motions for summary judgment in abeyance regarding Count I, pending the requested supplemental stipulations and briefing, which the court will outline in greater detail in the accompanying order.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-279\">\n   <strong>\n    <em>\n     <em>\n      2.

Count III targets the same features of Tennessee's system as Count I, but from a different angle. Relying largely on the Supreme Court's decision in\n   <em>\n    James v. Strange\n   </em>\n   ,\n   <extracted-citation case-ids=\"9136889\" index=\"539\" url=\"https://cite.case.law/us/407/128/\">\n    407 U.S. 128\n   </extracted-citation>\n   ,\n   <extracted-citation case-ids=\"9136889\" index=\"540\" url=\"https://cite.case.law/us/407/128/\">\n    92 S.Ct. 2027\n   </extracted-citation>\n   , Thomas and Hixson argue that section 40-24-105(b) denies equal protection by subjecting people holding court debt to a significantly harsher collection and enforcement scheme than Tennessee allows with regard to people holding private debt. In other words, while Count I compares the difference between the law's treatment of indigent court debtors and non-indigent court debtors, Count III turns to the difference between the law's treatment of court debtors and its treatment of private debtors. Much of Purkey's argument follows the same path he took with Count I. He argues that this scheme is governed by rational basis review, which the state's laws should survive.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-282\">\n   <em>\n    Strange\n   </em>\n   involved a Kansas statutory scheme for recouping amounts expended by the state on counsel and legal services provided to indigent criminal defendants pursuant to the state's obligations under\n   <em>\n    Gideon v.

Kansas also took its system of ordinary civil collections as its baseline, but ran afoul of the Constitution by subtracting a number of protections that would have been uniquely necessary for the very indigent or recently indigent debtors to which its statute applied. Tennessee took a different route, albeit one that, Thomas and Hixson argue, took it to much the same destination. Whereas Kansas took away protections from its ordinary scheme, Tennessee heaped on additional tools of coercion-most notably, the loss of a driver's license. While the structure of the schemes is different, the effect is the same: one particular type of debtor is singled out for a regime uniquely capable of driving those debtors into, or further and more inextricably into, poverty.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-292\">\n   Indeed, acknowledgment of the unique constitutional hazards of such a system can, as the court has noted, be found in the opinion of the\n   <em>\n    Johnson\n   </em>\n   Sixth Circuit majority.\n   <em>\n    Johnson\n   </em>\n   distinguished the Kansas debt scheme from Tennessee's re-enfranchisement scheme on the ground that\n   <em>\n    Johnson\n   </em>\n   involved a \"mere 'statutory benefit,' \" whereas\n   <em>\n    Strange\n   </em>\n   implicated the debtor's ability to \"support[ ] himself and his\n   family.' \"\n   <em>\n    Johnson\n   </em>\n   ,\n   <extracted-citation case-ids=\"3795188\" index=\"579\" url=\"https://cite.case.law/f3d/624/742/#p749\">\n    624 F.3d at 749\n   </extracted-citation>\n   (quoting\n   <em>\n    Harvey\n   </em>\n   ,\n   <extracted-citation index=\"580\" url=\"https://cite.case.law/citations/?q=605%20F.3d%201067\">\n    605 F.3d at\n   </extracted-citation>\n   1079 ;\n   <em>\n    Strange\n   </em>\n   ,\n   <extracted-citation case-ids=\"9136889\" index=\"581\" url=\"https://cite.case.law/us/407/128/\">\n    407 U.S. at 135\n   </extracted-citation>\n   ,\n   <extracted-citation case-ids=\"9136889\" index=\"582\" url=\"https://cite.case.law/us/407/128/\">\n    92 S.Ct. 2027\n   </extracted-citation>\n   ).

The court does not need to repeat its lengthy discussion above to establish that taking a person's driver's license away is, like Kansas' scheme of unlimited garnishment, a threat to the debtor's basic subsistence. Ultimately, then, the formal differences between Count I and Count III give way to substantial practical overlap. Although the theories undergirding each differ, both hinge on just how severe a sanction the revocation of a license is and just how greatly it harms the debtor's basic subsistence or ability to build economic self-sufficiency. For that reason, the court will likewise deny Purkey's motion to dismiss with regard to Count III and hold the motions for summary judgment in abeyance pending the requested supplemental stipulations and briefing.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-294\">\n   <strong>\n    <em>\n     <em>\n      3.

Purkey does not dispute that the state's revocation of a person's driver's license requires it to afford the minimal protections of due process. Purkey argues, instead, that the state's procedural due process obligation is satisfied by a combination of (1) the original due process afforded at the time of the debtor's conviction, (2) the fact that TDSHS sends notices informing debtors of their revocations, and (3) that a debtor who believes that his license was revoked in error because he had, in fact, paid his court debt can seek a review of his records from TDSHS.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-296\">\n   A driver's license, once issued, is \"not to be taken away without that procedural due process required by the Fourteenth Amendment.\"\n   <em>\n    Bell v.

The Court concluded that it was this last factor, the presence of a public safety issue, that particularly distinguished the case from\n   <em>\n    Bell.\n   </em>\n   Illinois' denial of a pre-deprivation hearing was permissible, in part, because the statute at issue was \"designed to keep off the roads those drivers who are unable or unwilling to respect traffic rules and the safety of others.\"\n   <em>\n    <extracted-citation case-ids=\"2000\" index=\"618\" url=\"https://cite.case.law/us/431/105/#p115\">\n     Id.\n    </extracted-citation>\n   </em>\n   <extracted-citation case-ids=\"2000\" index=\"618\" url=\"https://cite.case.law/us/431/105/#p115\">\n    at 115\n   </extracted-citation>\n   ,\n   <extracted-citation case-ids=\"2000\" index=\"619\" url=\"https://cite.case.law/us/431/105/#p115\">\n    97 S.Ct. 1723\n   </extracted-citation>\n   .\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-301\">\n   Purkey urges this court to treat\n   <em>\n    Dixon\n   </em>\n   as wholly determinative of TDSHS's obligations at issue in this case. That argument, however, ignores the fact that the factor that the Supreme Court appears to have considered most important in\n   <em>\n    Dixon\n   </em>\n   is entirely absent here. The scheme in\n   <em>\n    Dixon\n   </em>\n   was targeted at drivers who had amassed traffic offenses that could give rise to a reasonable inference that they were significantly more likely than the average driver to pose a risk to public safety if allowed on the road. In contrast, a person can find himself facing a section 40-24-105(b) revocation despite a spotless, or even exemplary, driving record. Despite Purkey's repeated attempts to ground Tennessee's revocation scheme in the state's power to police the safety of its highways, he has demonstrated no basis for concluding that a driver who cannot pay his court debt is any more of a risk to the drivers around him than a driver who can. Section 40-24-105(b) is not about safety; it is about payment. In that regard, it is more like the scheme at issue in\n   <em>\n    Bell.\n   </em>\n   Ultimately, though, Tennessee's policy of revoking driver's licenses based on court debt does not analogize perfectly to the laws at issue in either case. Whether a driver facing revocation is entitled to a pre-deprivation hearing must depend on a consideration of the particular rights, interests, and underlying evidentiary issues implicated here.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-302\">\n   The facts and briefing currently before the court leave a certain amount of ambiguity with regard to how, exactly, TDSHS processes initial revocations for failure to pay court debt. In his Reply in support of his Motion for Summary Judgment, Purkey writes:\n  </p>\n  <blockquote id=\"p-303\">\n   Plaintiffs are incorrect that the State revokes driver's licenses \"with no notice.\" Although Section 105(b) does not require pre-revocation notices, the Commissioner is required to send notice at the time of revocation.\n   <em>\n    See\n   </em>\n   <extracted-citation index=\"620\" url=\"https://cite.case.law/citations/?q=Tenn.%20Code%20Ann.%20%C2%A7%2055-50-504\">\n    Tenn.

This language, as far as the court can tell, states that, while section 40-25-105 does not\n   <em>\n    itself\n   </em>\n   require pre-revocation notice, another statute, section 55-50-504(h) does require notice, after which the revocation cannot \"take effect\" for ten days. Under that statute:\n  </p>\n  <blockquote id=\"p-305\">\n   Notwithstanding any other law to the contrary, revocation or suspension of a license shall not take effect until ten (10) days after notice has been sent to the last known address of the driver. The notice requirement in this subsection (h) shall not apply to a driver whose license has been revoked or suspended by a court of competent jurisdiction or who has surrendered the license to the court.\n  </blockquote>\n  <p id=\"p-306\">\n   <em>\n    <extracted-citation index=\"622\" url=\"https://cite.case.law/citations/?q=Tenn.%20Code%20Ann.%20%C2%A7%2055-50-504\">\n     Id.\n    </extracted-citation>\n   </em>\n   The relevant section of Purkey's Reply, however, does not actually cite to any portion of either party's Undisputed Material Facts or Responses thereto in order to support the contention that TDSHS actually\n   <em>\n    does\n   </em>\n   wait ten days for its revocations to go into effect.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-307\">\n   The crux of this discrepancy appears to be Purkey's distinction between when his agency changes a driver's \"status\" and when the revocation of the license is \"effective.\" Purkey admits that \"the Department revokes a person's driver's license on the same day that it receives notification of non-payment from the court.\" (Docket No. 64 \u00b6 28.) However, Purkey also claims that, \"while revocation is effective as of the date that notification is [sent] to the driver by the Department, the Department does not change the status of the driver's license for a period of 10 days in order to allow the driver to receive notification from the Department.\" (Docket No. 64 \u00b6 28.) This distinction, though, does not appear to reflect what Purkey now admits he is bound to do pursuant to section 55-50-504(h), which\n   makes no mention of the \"status\" of the driver's license, only when the revocation \"shall ... take effect.\"\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-308\">\n   In any event, the court need not dwell too long on this confusion, because Count II survives, for now, regardless. Whether TDSHS actually waits ten days for a revocation to take effect might become a key issue, if Thomas and Hixson ultimately fail to prevail on Counts I and III. If they do prevail on Counts I and III, however, the fact that they have not been afforded procedural due process will be a foregone conclusion, because they will have been, as a matter of law, entitled to an opportunity for a hearing that they have not been afforded. Moreover, the question of what type of hearing might be necessary will inevitably hinge on the outcome of Counts I and III, because the substantive nature of the rights and facts at issue affects the application of the\n   <em>\n    Eldridge\n   </em>\n   factors. The court, accordingly, will deny Purkey's motion to dismiss with regard to Count II, and will add, to its requested briefing, that Purkey clarify TDSHS's practices regarding whether a driver's license is considered revoked for the ten days following the agency's sending a notice letter. The motions for summary judgment will be held in abeyance in full.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-309\">\n   <strong>\n    <em>\n     C. Class Certification\n    </em>\n   </strong>\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-310\">\n   Thomas and Hixson seek certification of a class defined as \"[a]ll persons whose Tennessee driver's licenses have been or will be revoked pursuant to the Statute and who, at the time of the revocation, cannot or could not pay Court Debt due to their financial circumstances.\" (Docket No. 1 \u00b6 93.) Purkey argues that Thomas and Hixson are not entitled to certification of their class for five reasons: (1) they have failed to produce appropriate evidence sufficient to meet their burden under Rule 23 ; (2) they cannot satisfy the numerosity requirement because they have not demonstrated what portion of people with revoked licenses are indigent; (3) they cannot satisfy the commonality requirement because the population of drivers with revoked licenses involves substantial variation in the issues and postures presented by each individual case; (4) they similarly cannot satisfy the typicality requirement because Thomas and Hixson proving their own right to relief would not necessarily establish the right to relief of others; and (5) they cannot satisfy Rule 23(b)(2) because they cannot identify a form of injunctive relief that would be applicable to the class as a whole.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-311\">\n   <strong>\n    <em>\n     <em>\n      1. Reliance on Statement of Claudia Wilner\n     </em>\n    </em>\n   </strong>\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-312\">\n   Purkey objects to the plaintiffs' reliance, in their motion for class certification, on a\n   <extracted-citation index=\"623\" url=\"https://cite.case.law/citations/?q=28%20U.S.C.%20%C2%A7%201746\">\n    28 U.S.C. \u00a7 1746\n   </extracted-citation>\n   declaration of Claudia Wilner, which addresses a number of foundational facts regarding their proposed class and Tennessee's scheme for revoking driver's licenses for court debt. (Docket No. 6-3.) Wilner is one of the plaintiffs' lawyers, and Purkey asks the court to strike her declaration on the ground that Wilner has inappropriately proffered herself as a fact witness in a case where she is also serving as counsel.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-313\">\n   Under Tennessee's Rules of Professional Conduct, \"[a] lawyer shall not act as an advocate at a trial in which the lawyer is likely to be a necessary witness unless\" one of three enumerated exceptions applies. Tenn. Sup. Ct. R. 8, RPC 3.7(a) ;\n   <em>\n    see also\n   </em>\n   Local R. 83.01(e)(4) (\"The standard of professional conduct of the members of the bar of this Court shall include the current Tennessee Code of Professional Responsibility, Tenn. Sup. Ct. R. 8.\"). As Thomas and Hixson point out, Rule 3.7(a), at least by its text, specifically applies to activity\n   \"at trial\" and does not directly address preliminary stages such as a motion for class certification. Nevertheless, Rule 3.7(a) may be implicated by these earlier proceedings if an attorney's activities or statements are such that they would make her \"likely to be a necessary witness\" when the time for trial arrives.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-314\">\n   Nothing in Wilner's statement raises such an issue here. For example, as the court has already noted, Rule 3.7(a) expressly permits an attorney to provide \"testimony relat[ing] to an uncontested issue.\" Tenn. Sup. Ct. R. 8, RPC 3.7(a)(1). Several of the facts attested to by Wilner fall clearly within that exception. For example, Wilner attests that only 7% of the people whose licenses were revoked from July 1, 2012 through June 2, 2016, have had their licenses restored. (Docket No. 6-3 \u00b6\u00b6 11-13.) Purkey has since stipulated to that fact. (Docket No. 40 \u00b6 44.) Other of Wilner's claims are merely citations to materials put out by the State of Tennessee itself. For example, she cites the Tennessee Department of Correction's own figures regarding the number of people released by the state from jail or prison in Fiscal Year 2015-16 (13,987) and the average time served (4.57 years). (Docket No. 62 \u00b6 14.)\n   <em>\n    See\n   </em>\n   Tenn. Dep't of Corr., Statistical Abstract: Fiscal Year 2016 30 (Oct. 2016).\n   <footnotemark>\n    16\n   </footnotemark>\n   \"[P]ublic records and government documents available from reliable sources\" are generally appropriate for judicial notice.\n   <em>\n    U.S. ex rel.

Wilner's citation to those statistics is, therefore, little different than simply citing them in a brief. Still other of Wilner's statements bear on issues related to her representation of her client and fall within Rule 3.7(a)(2)'s exception for \"testimony relat[ing] to the nature ... of legal services rendered in the case.\" (\n   <em>\n    See, e.g.\n   </em>\n   , Docket No. 6-3 \u00b6\u00b6 1-2, 25.)\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-315\">\n   Wilner does draw the court's attention to a handful of third-party sources related to the prevalence of poverty among people with criminal records. (\n   <em>\n    Id.\n   </em>\n   \u00b6 16 (citing Rebecca Vallas &amp; Sharon Dietrich,\n   <em>\n    One Strike and You're Out: How We Can Eliminate Barriers to Economic Security and Mobility for People with Criminal Records\n   </em>\n   9 (2014); The Pew Charitable Trusts,\n   <em>\n    Collateral Costs: Incarceration's Effect on Economic Mobility\n   </em>\n   (2010); Joan Petersilia,\n   <em>\n    When Prisoners Return to the Community: Political, Economic and Social Consequences\n   </em>\n   , Sentencing &amp; Corrections, Nov. 2000, at 9.) If Wilner were planning to testify at trial regarding the credibility and contents of those reports, it would indeed likely pose a problem under Rule 3.7(a), as was discussed regarding the Brookings Report earlier. Unless Purkey disputes those reports' very existence, however, Wilner's merely informing the court that the reports have been published is not fact testimony on a contested issue. In any event, the court does not rely on those third-party reports for its certification decision.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-316\">\n   The few bits of Wilner's attestation that arguably bear on contestable factual issues merely involve Wilner's drawing simple inferences from the law and the uncontested facts presented. For example, Ms. Wilner speculates about the feasibility of a court debtor's repayment of court debt while he is still incarcerated. (Docket No. 6-3 \u00b6 13.) Insofar as these few statements amount to factual assertions, the court finds them unnecessary to resolving the issue of class certification and finds that they do not establish that Wilner is likely to be a necessary\n   witness at trial. Purkey's request that Wilner's statement be stricken is, therefore, denied.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-317\">\n   <strong>\n    <em>\n     <em>\n      2. Numerosity\n     </em>\n    </em>\n   </strong>\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-318\">\n   Purkey argues next that Thomas and Hixson cannot establish that their proposed class is sufficiently numerous to warrant certification under Rule 23. Purkey concedes that, from July 1, 2012, to June 1, 2016, TDSHS revoked 146,211 driver's licenses for failure to pay fines, costs and/or litigation taxes and restored only 10,750. (Docket No. 64 \u00b6 107-08;\n   <em>\n    see also\n   </em>\n   Docket No. 40 \u00b6\u00b6 43-44 (stipulating to statistics) ). He argues, however, that there is no way to know how many of those people were indigent. Thomas and Hixson, he argues, have therefore failed to demonstrate numerosity.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-319\">\n   Rule 23(a)(1) requires that the class be so numerous that joinder of all members is impracticable.

Ohio 2001) ). Facts, common sense, and the basic features of the statutes at issue all dictate that there is little doubt that that is the case here. Tennessee's own Administrative Office of the Courts has written that it is \"generally agreed that approximately 75% of those being prosecuted by the district attorney will be indigent\" for the purpose of providing counsel. Tenn. Admin. Office of the Courts,\n   <em>\n    Tennessee's Indigent Defense Fund: A Report to the 107th Tennessee General Assembly\n   </em>\n   19 (2011).\n   <footnotemark>\n    17\n   </footnotemark>\n   Although one can debate the degree to which that number would translate to indigence for the purpose of paying court debt, it establishes a reasonable baseline for considering the pervasiveness of indigence in the Tennessee criminal justice system. Moreover, the nature of Tennessee's scheme is that every person who cannot pay his court debt will face revocation unless he happens to receive some form of discretionary relief from a court. To deny that there are a substantial number of indigent debtors facing revocation, then, is essentially to deny that indigent debtors exist at all-or, at the very least, to assume, based on no evidence, that all or virtually all of those debtors have received relief that is, by its own terms, wholly discretionary. Such a\n   possibility strikes the court as decidedly implausible.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-321\">\n   Moreover, as Thomas and Hixson point out, their class would be sufficiently numerous, even if only a small percentage of the people whose licenses have been revoked turned out to be indigent. Indeed, if only one percent of the people whose licenses were revoked and never restored were indigent, then there would still be over 1,300 class members. Purkey's own speculation on this point tends actually to support the position of the plaintiffs. Purkey speculates that, although Thomas and Hixson suggest that most of the people whose licenses were revoked pursuant to section 40-24-105(b) were indigent, \"[i]t is just as likely, based upon the proof before this Court at this stage, that a majority of those revocations involved individuals with the means to satisfy the outstanding sums.\" (Docket No. 67 at 7.) But even if a bare majority of those people are non-indigent, that still leaves a class of tens of thousands. Even in Purkey's counter-hypothetical intended to ward off certification, then, the plaintiffs' class is sufficiently numerous. The court will not deny certification for failure to satisfy Rule 23(a)(1).\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-322\">\n   <strong>\n    <em>\n     <em>\n      3. Commonality and Typicality\n     </em>\n    </em>\n   </strong>\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-323\">\n   Purkey's latter two objections under Rule 23(a) raise the same issue from different angles. Thomas and Hixson are two particular defendants, facing indigency for their own specific reasons, required to pay court debt in two particular counties. Tennessee, however, has numerous judicial districts, courts, and clerks' offices, which deal with a wide array of defendants. The practices for assessing and dealing with court debt may well vary substantially from county to county, from judge to judge, and from case to case. The questions then arise: (1) do all of the indigent people facing or living with revocations truly suffer a common injury; and (2) are the injuries of Thomas and Hixson truly typical of those injuries?\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-324\">\n   <em>\n    <em>\n     a. Commonality\n    </em>\n   </em>\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-325\">\n   Purkey is correct that Thomas and Hixson seek to assert claims for a diverse class of plaintiffs. The commonality requirement, however, does not simply call for the court to list all the traits that can be ascribed to the various class members and tally up the differences. \"Commonality\" refers to commonality with regard to the specific claims asserted. In order for the court to certify the class under Rule 23, the class members' claims must depend upon a common contention of such a nature that it is capable of class-wide resolution.\n   <em>\n    In re Whirlpool Corp.

As the court has already discussed, those two questions implicate a number of legal and factual sub-issues, which will also be shared by the class. Moreover, while the individual cases of the different class members may vary substantially, those variations are immaterial to the categorical right that Thomas and Hixson\n   have asserted. If Thomas and Hixson had cast their net more widely and sought to litigate the general fairness of Tennessee's system of court debt, Purkey might be correct that the substantial amount of local and case-by-case variation would make class certification impossible. Thomas and Hixson, however, are not asking the court to consider the constitutionality of every debt assessment, collection effort, or clerk's office policy. They complain of a specific injury: the revocation of a person's driver's license for nonpayment of court debt without the opportunity to demonstrate that the person is entitled to an exception from revocation based on his indigence. That injury is common throughout the proposed class, as are the questions of law and fact underlying it.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-327\">\n   Purkey argues next that Thomas and Hixson cannot establish commonality, because the various members of the class pose different safety risks if allowed on the road. Section 40-24-105(b), however, has nothing to do with safety risk. Tennessee has other provisions for the revocation of driver's licenses for reasons related to safety.\n   <em>\n    See, e.g.\n   </em>\n   ,\n   <extracted-citation index=\"637\" url=\"https://cite.case.law/citations/?q=Tenn.%20Code%20Ann.%20%C2%A7%2055-50-501\">\n    Tenn. Code Ann. \u00a7 55-50-501\n   </extracted-citation>\n   (a)(1) (calling for revocation based on conviction for vehicular homicide), (a)(2) (calling for revocation based on conviction for driving under the influence). The only reason anyone loses his license pursuant to section 40-24-105(b) is, by definition, that the person failed to pay court debt. The proposed class presumably includes both excellent drivers and mediocre drivers, just like the general population. This case, though, is concerned only with the impediment to their driving related solely to unpaid court debt. If a member of the class should qualify for revocation for some other reason, the proposed relief would pose no obstacle. With regard to the narrow claims raised in this case, Thomas and Hixson have established commonality.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-328\">\n   <em>\n    <em>\n     b. Typicality\n    </em>\n   </em>\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-329\">\n   Typicality is met if the class members' claims are fairly encompassed by the named plaintiffs' claims. This requirement ensures that the class representatives' interests are aligned with the interests of the represented class members so that, by pursuing his own interests, the class representative also advocates the interests of the class members.\n   <em>\n    Whirlpool\n   </em>\n   ,\n   <extracted-citation case-ids=\"4063713\" index=\"638\" url=\"https://cite.case.law/f3d/722/838/#p852\">\n    722 F.3d at 852-53\n   </extracted-citation>\n   . Thus, a plaintiff's claim is typical if it arises from the same event or practice or course of conduct that gives rise to the claims of other class members and if his claims are based on the same legal theory.\n   <em>\n    In re Am. Med.

Commonality and typicality tend to merge because both of them serve as guideposts for determining whether, under the particular circumstances, maintenance of a class action is economical, and whether the plaintiff's claims and the class claims are so interrelated that the interests of the class members will be fairly and adequately protected in their absence.\n   <em>\n    Young v.

The underlying economic situations of Thomas and Hixson and the details of their convictions may be unique to them, but, with regard to the issues central to their claims, Thomas and Hixson are as typical as any member of the class. Because they have faced and received revocations for unpaid court debt under section 10-24-105 and they are indigent, they are typical.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-331\">\n   <strong>\n    <em>\n     <em>\n      4. Rule 23(b)\n     </em>\n    </em>\n   </strong>\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-332\">\n   Purkey's argument regarding Rule 23(b) mirrors his arguments on commonality and typicality and, ultimately, succumbs to the\n   same flaws. After a plaintiff shows that he satisfies all of the requirements of Rule 23(a), he must establish that \"the class he seeks to represent falls within one of the subcategories of Rule 23(b).\"\n   <em>\n    Senter\n   </em>\n   ,\n   <extracted-citation case-ids=\"10590762\" index=\"641\" url=\"https://cite.case.law/f2d/532/511/#p522\">\n    532 F.2d at 522\n   </extracted-citation>\n   . Thomas and Hixson rely on Rule 23(b)(2), which covers situations in which \"the party opposing the class has acted or refused to act on grounds that apply generally to the class, so that final injunctive relief or corresponding declaratory relief is appropriate respecting the class as a whole.\" Fed. R. Civ. P. 23(b)(2). Rule 23(b)(2) permits certification only for \"those classes with homogenous interests\" relative to the relief sought.\n   <em>\n    McDonald v.

Thomas and Hixson, however, are not asking this court to wade into every judicial district's procedures and solve the wide array of challenges facing every debtor. Rather, they are asking the court simply to enjoin TDSHS from enforcing the statute in its current form because TDSHS's process makes no allowance for indigence of the debtor. Rule 23(b)(2) is well suited to cases, such as this one, where class representatives allege an injury inherent to the administration of a generally applicable government policy.\n   <em>\n    See\n   </em>\n   <em>\n    Daffin v.

It may be that the constitutional protections that Thomas and Hixson seek to vindicate can be satisfied while continuing to allow for a substantial amount of local variation regarding how the required safeguards are actually to be provided. That hypothetical potential for variation, however, does not negate the unitary nature of the relief sought. The plaintiffs' claims meet the requirements of Rule 23(b)(2).\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-334\">\n   <strong>\n    <em>\n     <em>\n      5. Propriety of Certification\n     </em>\n    </em>\n   </strong>\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-335\">\n   Purkey identifies no other grounds for denying class certification here. Rule 23(a)(4) requires the court only to certify the class if \"the representative parties will fairly and adequately protect the interests of the class.\" That requirement considers both general commonality of interests and whether the putative representative \"will vigorously prosecute the interests of the class through qualified counsel.\"\n   <em>\n    Gonzales v. Cassidy\n   </em>\n   ,\n   <extracted-citation case-ids=\"1252331\" index=\"646\" url=\"https://cite.case.law/f2d/474/67/#p73\">\n    474 F.2d 67\n   </extracted-citation>\n   , 73 (5th Cir. 1973). The record provides ample basis for concluding that Thomas and Hixson have made such a showing. Thomas and Hixson have also satisfied Rule 23(a)(1), (2), and (3) by showing numerosity, commonality, and typicality, and they have demonstrated that their case falls within the boundaries of Rule 23(b)(2). Rule 23(c)(1) directs this court to determine whether to certify a class \"[a]t an early practicable time after a person sues or is sued as a class representative,\" and there appear to be no more substantive questions remaining regarding whether certification is appropriate here. The court, accordingly, will certify the proposed class.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-336\">\n   One procedural issue, however, remains outstanding: appointment of class counsel. Rule 23(g) requires the court to appoint counsel to represent the class, chosen from among counsel involved in the litigation on behalf of individual members of the class. Hixson and Thomas have not identified whom, specifically, they are putting forward to serve as class counsel. Although the court notes that \"the materials submitted in support of the motion for class\n   certification may suffice to justify appointment [of class counsel] so long as the information described in paragraph (g)(1)(C) is included,\" Fed. R. Civ. P. 23(g)(2) advisory committee's note, the court will, rather than guessing at what Thomas and Hixson would propose, direct their counsel to designate which individual or individuals seek appointment as class counsel.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-337\">\n   <strong>\n    <em>\n     IV.

Each of the six remaining interests is, in one way or another, simply a reformulation or component of the state's interest in assessing and enforcing fines, costs, and litigation taxes. (\n    <em>\n     See\n    </em>\n    Docket No. 63-1 at 24-25.) Because the legitimacy of the state's interest is conceded, there is no need to dwell on the many ways that that interest can be restated, subdivided, and characterized.\n   </p>\n  </footnote>\n  <footnote label=\"8\">\n   <p id=\"p-364\">\n    The court notes, however, that the issue of facial neutrality regarding indigence is something of a red herring here. If a statute imposes a sanction on a person for not paying a sum of money, the statute is not, in any meaningful way, neutral on the question of how much money the person has.\n   </p>\n  </footnote>\n  <footnote label=\"9\">\n   <p id=\"p-365\">\n    Again, Tennessee is not New York City or Chicago, where public transportation is so ubiquitous that many people do not own cars and some never even learn to drive.\n   </p>\n  </footnote>\n  <footnote label=\"10\">\n   <p id=\"p-366\">\n    Purkey would presumably respond that the success of section 40-24-105(b) is shown not by the small number of people who paid their debt after revocation, but by the people who, out of fear of losing their licenses, paid before a year was up. But those people, by definition, were capable of paying, unlike the debtors at issue here. They could just as easily be coerced by a mechanism with an exception for indigent debtors like Thomas and Hixson.\n   </p>\n  </footnote>\n  <footnote label=\"11\">\n   <p id=\"p-367\">\n    Indeed, it appears that the complaining parties in at least some of the post-\n    <em>\n     Griffin\n    </em>\n    cases may have already been denied just that kind of discretionary relief.\n    <em>\n     See\n    </em>\n    <em>\n     Williams\n    </em>\n    ,\n    <extracted-citation case-ids=\"6169466\" index=\"666\" url=\"https://cite.case.law/us/399/235/\">\n     399 U.S. at 237\n    </extracted-citation>\n    ,\n    <extracted-citation case-ids=\"6169466\" index=\"667\" url=\"https://cite.case.law/us/399/235/\">\n     90 S.Ct. 2018\n    </extracted-citation>\n    (noting that Williams \"petitioned the sentencing judge to vacate that portion of the order requiring that he remain imprisoned upon expiration of his one year sentence because of nonpayment of the fine and court costs\" and quoting a portion of the sentencing court's decision including discussion of prudential concerns),\n    <em>\n     reversing\n    </em>\n    <em>\n     People v.
