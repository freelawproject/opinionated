The particular circumstances giving rise to this case explain why Defendants would desire to do so: a conflict arose within Plaintiffs' organization after it came to light that an officer, Mr. Vaughn, was allegedly misappropriating funds. Defendants' members, unhappy with how the situation was handled, thus departed from Plaintiffs' organization.\n   <em>\n    See\n   </em>\n   Dkt. 256 at 5. It is unsurprising, therefore, that Defendants would want to\n   <em>\n    avoid\n   </em>\n   any confusion between themselves and Plaintiffs. Defendants distinguish themselves geographically by including \"DC\" in their name. Their intent to separate themselves from Plaintiffs is further reflected on Defendants' website.\n   <em>\n    See\n   </em>\n   Raschid Muller, \"The United Supreme Council - An introduction to Who We Are,\" United Supreme Council Southern Jurisdiction PHA-DC, www.uscsjpha-dc.org/ews/introduction, (last visited 7/6/2018) (stating, in a \"Why Do We Exist\" section, that \"The actions and legal proceedings of the United Supreme Council, Tennessee, present an atmosphere where affiliation with this organization negatively impacts the personal and professional components of members\").\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-62\">\n   Most importantly, the Court considers whether there is any evidence of actual confusion.\n   <em>\n    See\n   </em>\n   <em>\n    George &amp; Co.
