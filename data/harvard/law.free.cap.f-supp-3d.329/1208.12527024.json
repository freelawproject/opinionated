ECF Nos. 1 at 1; 17 at 6. Consequently, claims that are governed by a limitation period of five years or less are untimely.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-18\">\n   <strong>\n    A. Declaratory Relief (Count One)\n   </strong>\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-19\">\n   Count one of the amended complaint seeks a declaration that the deed of trust still encumbers the property or that the HOA sale was void. ECF No. 17 at 6-8. Southern Highlands argues this claim is essentially one to quiet title so a five-year limitation period applies. SFR argues that this claim alleges statutory violations under Nevada Revised Statutes Chapter 116 and generally challenges Southern Highlands' authority to foreclose as it did, and thus a three-year limitation period applies under Nevada Revised Statutes \u00a7 11.190(3)(a). Alternatively, SFR argues the four-year catchall provision in \u00a7 11.220 applies.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-20\">\n   BONY responds that no limitation period applies because the sale was conducted pursuant to an unconstitutional statute and thus is void as a matter of law. BONY also argues that its claim is based on the fact that it tendered the superpriority amount and that the sale should be set aside for fraud, oppression, or unfairness, so its claim does not necessarily rely on statutory violations. BONY asserts a variety of reasons as to why its claim is timely, including that (1) the time to enforce the deed of trust has not expired, so its claim about the continued validity of the deed of trust is timely; (2) its declaratory relief claim is a defense to a future wrongful foreclosure claim by SFR if BONY proceeds with a foreclosure; (3) non-judicial foreclosures are not subject to a statute of limitations, so a declaratory relief claim seeking permission to foreclose likewise has no limitation period; and (4) even if a limitation period applies, it would be 10 years from acceleration or maturity under \u00a7 106.240.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-21\">\n   Alternatively, BONY argues that if a shorter limitation period applies, BONY's complaint should relate back to when it initiated non-judicial foreclosure proceedings in November 2008, or the limitation period should be equitably tolled because BONY did not delay initiating non-judicial foreclosure proceedings, less than three years after the borrower was in default.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-22\">\n   I have previously ruled that the four-year catchall limitation period in \u00a7 11.220 applies to claims under \u00a7 40.010\n   brought by a lienholder seeking to determine whether an HOA sale extinguished its deed of trust.\n   <em>\n    See\n   </em>\n   <em>\n    Country Garden Owners Ass'n\n   </em>\n   ,\n   <extracted-citation index=\"17\" url=\"https://cite.case.law/citations/?q=2018%20WL%201336721\">\n    2018 WL 1336721\n   </extracted-citation>\n   , at *2. BONY's claim for a declaration that the deed of trust was not extinguished therefore is untimely.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-23\">\n   BONY relies on\n   <em>\n    Facklam v. HSBC Bank USA for Deutsche ALT-A Sec. Mortg.

In\n   <em>\n    Facklam\n   </em>\n   , the Supreme Court of Nevada held that no statute of limitation applies to a non-judicial foreclosure because such statutes apply only to judicial actions.\n   <extracted-citation index=\"19\" url=\"https://cite.case.law/citations/?q=401%20P.3d%201068\">\n    401 P.3d at 1070-71\n   </extracted-citation>\n   .\n   <em>\n    Facklam\n   </em>\n   has no application here because BONY commenced this judicial action, to which a statute of limitations applies.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-24\">\n   Alternatively, BONY contends that if a limitation period applies, its claim is governed by Nevada Revised Statutes \u00a7 106.240. That section provides:\n  </p>\n  <blockquote id=\"p-25\">\n   The lien heretofore or hereafter created of any mortgage or deed of trust upon any real property, appearing of record, and not otherwise satisfied and discharged of record, shall at the expiration of 10 years after the debt secured by the mortgage or deed of trust according to the terms thereof or any recorded written extension thereof become wholly due, terminate, and it shall be conclusively presumed that the debt has been regularly satisfied and the lien discharged.\n  </blockquote>\n  <p id=\"p-26\">\n   This section is not a statute of limitation. It \"creates a conclusive presumption that a lien on real property is extinguished ten years after the debt becomes due.\"\n   <em>\n    Pro-Max Corp. v.

Generally, a party can assert defenses \"that, if raised as claims, would be time-barred,\" because the statute of limitations \"should be used only as a shield, not a sword.\"\n   <em>\n    City of Saint Paul, Alaska v.

TDX's counterclaims were filed in response to the City's claims, not as affirmative claims for relief. Indeed, the City's defenses to those counterclaims are mirror images of its time-barred claims. No matter what gloss the City puts on its defenses, they are simply time-barred claims masquerading as defenses and are likewise subject to the statute of limitations bar. In launching the current litigation, the City abandoned its right to seek solace in the status of a defendant.

That claim is expired, however, and I predict\n   <footnotemark>\n    1\n   </footnotemark>\n   the Supreme Court of Nevada would not allow BONY to evade the limitation on that claim by re-characterizing it as a defense.\n   <em>\n    See\n    <extracted-citation case-ids=\"781021\" index=\"32\" url=\"https://cite.case.law/f3d/344/1029/#p1033\">\n     id.\n    </extracted-citation>\n   </em>\n   (stating \"a plaintiff cannot engage in a subterfuge to characterize a claim as a defense in order to avoid a temporal bar\"). I do not decide whether BONY will be able to assert its arguments as defenses should SFR ever sue BONY because that issue is not before me.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-33\">\n   BONY's first claim for declaratory relief is thus untimely, unless some other reasons exist to extend or dispense with the statute of limitations. BONY suggests multiple grounds for why its claim is still timely, including that the sale was conducted pursuant to an unconstitutional statute, that the amended complaint should relate back to when BONY initiated non-judicial foreclosure proceedings, or that the limitation period should be equitably tolled.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-34\">\n   BONY cites no authority for its argument that if the sale was conducted pursuant to an unconstitutional statute, no limitation period applies. The Supreme Court of Nevada has applied a statute of limitations to a claim alleging that tax revenues were unevenly distributed pursuant to an unconstitutional statute.\n   <em>\n    See\n   </em>\n   <em>\n    City of Fernley v. State, Dep't of Tax\n   </em>\n   , --- Nev. ----,\n   <extracted-citation index=\"33\" url=\"https://cite.case.law/citations/?q=366%20P.3d%20699\">\n    366 P.3d 699\n   </extracted-citation>\n   , 707 (Nev. 2016), reh'g denied (Feb. 19, 2016). The Supreme Court of Nevada thus applies statutes of limitations to acts taken pursuant to an allegedly unconstitutional statute.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-35\">\n   BONY likewise cites no authority for the proposition that a complaint may relate back to pre-litigation events. Under Federal Rule of Civil Procedure 15(c) an \"amendment to a pleading relates back to the date of the original pleading\" under certain circumstances. The Rule applies to amendments of pleadings, not the original complaint, and it allows relation back to the date of the original complaint, not some event prior in time. Nevada's relation-back rule is the same.\n   <em>\n    See\n   </em>\n   Nev. R. Civ. P. 15(c) (\"Whenever the claim or defense asserted in the amended pleading arose out of the conduct, transaction, or occurrence set forth or attempted to be set forth in the original pleading, the amendment relates back to the date of the original pleading.\"). BONY's complaint does not relate back to when BONY filed the notice of default and election to sell.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-36\">\n   As for equitable tolling,\n   <footnotemark>\n    2\n   </footnotemark>\n   BONY relies on facts that are not alleged\n   in the amended complaint, including that BONY filed a notice of breach and election to sell.\n   <em>\n    See\n   </em>\n   ECF No. 26 at 9-10. Because BONY has not plausibly alleged facts in the amended complaint supporting tolling, I will grant the motions to dismiss the declaratory relief claim in count one, but without prejudice to BONY amending to add facts that would make plausible the potential for equitable tolling.\n   <em>\n    See\n   </em>\n   <em>\n    Cervantes v.

I express no opinion at this time whether BONY's arguments in its opposition would support equitable tolling. That will depend on what BONY alleges in an amended complaint.\n   <footnotemark>\n    3\n   </footnotemark>\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-37\">\n   <strong>\n    B. Declaratory Relief in Count Two\n   </strong>\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-38\">\n   In count two, BONY seeks a declaration that it may enforce the deed of trust through a judicial or non-judicial foreclosure. ECF No. 17 at 9-10. The parties raise similar arguments about this claim's timeliness. Additionally, Southern Highlands argues this claim is contingent on the first claim, and so it must be dismissed if count one is dismissed.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-39\">\n   \"A claim for declaratory relief is subject to a statute of limitations generally applicable to civil claims.\"\n   <em>\n    Zuill v.

Where \"a claim for declaratory relief could have been resolved through another form of action which has a specific limitations period, the specific period of time will govern.\"\n   <em>\n    Levald, Inc. v.

BONY states that it seeks a declaration that it may foreclose non-judicially or judicially. A foreclosure is a remedy for breach of a promissory note secured by a deed of trust.\n   <em>\n    Facklam\n   </em>\n   ,\n   <extracted-citation index=\"37\" url=\"https://cite.case.law/citations/?q=401%20P.3d%201068\">\n    401 P.3d at 1070\n   </extracted-citation>\n   (\"When the grantor defaults on the note, the deed-of-trust beneficiary can select the judicial process for foreclosure pursuant to NRS 40.430 or the 'nonjudicial' foreclosure-by-trustee's sale procedure under NRS Chapter 107.\"). But BONY has not sued the borrower and does not seek to actually foreclose. Instead, it asks permission to do\n   so in some separate proceeding after this case concludes. The fact that BONY seeks declaratory relief against SFR, and not the borrower, shows that what BONY really wants in count two is a declaration that the HOA foreclosure sale did not extinguish its deed of trust. BONY's allegations confirm that is, at bottom, what BONY seeks.\n   <em>\n    See\n   </em>\n   ECF No. 17 at 9 (alleging in count two that the controversy is between SFR and BONY because \"SFR claims an interest in the property by way of the HOA foreclosure sale\" but BONY asserts its deed of trust remains an encumbrance on the property \"because the deed of trust remains on the property after the HOA foreclosure sale or the HOA foreclosure sale was void\"). In other words, count two is a repeat of count one. As such, it is duplicative and untimely, so I dismiss it.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-41\">\n   Count two is not only the same as count one, it raises potential problems with this court issuing an advisory opinion, which I cannot do.\n   <em>\n    Golden v.

The borrower is not a party to this action. And there are many defenses and issues in a foreclosure that would not necessarily be litigated in this declaratory relief action. Instead, a declaratory judgment in this case granting BONY permission to foreclose would result in either an irrelevant abstraction if BONY did not then commence a foreclosure, or a wasteful and duplicative proceeding because assuming BONY was successful in getting the declaration it wants, it would then have to commence a non-judicial\n   <footnotemark>\n    4\n   </footnotemark>\n   or judicial foreclosure. That is the \"actual\" proceeding in which the concrete issues should and would be resolved, not this one.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-42\">\n   <strong>\n    C. Equitable Indemnification (Count Three)\n   </strong>\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-43\">\n   Count three asserts that Southern Highlands and Alessi must equitably indemnify BONY if the deed of trust was extinguished by the HOA foreclosure sale. ECF No. 17 at 10-11. Southern Highlands argues this claim is untimely because it is subject to a four-year limitation period in \u00a7 11.190(2)(c) or alternatively it is based on alleged statutory violations and subject to a three-year limitation period in \u00a7 11.190(3)(a). BONY responds that this claim is timely because the limitation period does not begin to run for this type of claim until BONY suffers an actual loss due to an underlying judgment, which BONY contends would be if and when a court rules that its deed of trust is extinguished.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-44\">\n   Equitable indemnity claims are governed by \u00a7 11.190(2)(c)'s four-year limitations period for actions on implied contracts.\n   <em>\n    Saylor v.

There is no\n   allegation BONY has paid a settlement or judgment, so this claim is not time-barred.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-45\">\n   This is not to say that I am holding BONY has a viable equitable indemnification claim in these circumstances. To the contrary, the doctrine does not appear to apply at all to this situation.\n   <em>\n    See, e.g.\n   </em>\n   ,\n   <em>\n    Rodriguez\n   </em>\n   ,\n   <extracted-citation case-ids=\"3710079\" index=\"49\" url=\"https://cite.case.law/nev/125/578/\">\n    216 P.3d at 801\n   </extracted-citation>\n   (\"A claimant seeking equitable indemnity must plead and prove that: (1) it has discharged a legal obligation owed to a third party; (2) the party from whom it seeks liability also was liable to the third party; and (3) as between the claimant and the party from whom it seeks indemnity, the obligation ought to be discharged by the latter.\"). However, Southern Highlands has not moved to dismiss on this basis, so I do not dismiss BONY's claim at this point. That being said, if BONY amends its complaint, it should consider whether equitable indemnification is a proper claim in this context.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-46\">\n   <strong>\n    D. Wrongful Foreclosure (Count Four)\n   </strong>\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-47\">\n   Count four asserts a wrongful foreclosure claim against Southern Highlands and Alessi. Southern Highlands argues this claim is barred by the three-year limitation period in \u00a7 11.190(3)(a) because it is based on statutory violations or it challenges Southern Highlands' statutory authority to foreclose. BONY responds that it did not know its deed of trust might have been extinguished by the HOA sale until the Supreme Court of Nevada issued its decision in\n   <em>\n    SFR Investments Pool 1, LLC v. U.S. Bank, N.A.\n   </em>\n   ,\n   <extracted-citation index=\"50\" url=\"https://cite.case.law/citations/?q=130%20Nev.%20742\">\n    130 Nev. 742\n   </extracted-citation>\n   ,\n   <extracted-citation index=\"51\" url=\"https://cite.case.law/citations/?q=334%20P.3d%20408\">\n    334 P.3d 408\n   </extracted-citation>\n   (2014) (en banc). Alternatively, BONY argues its claim is not even ripe yet because it will not suffer damages until a court declares that its deed of trust was extinguished. BONY also contends that if this claim is subject to a limitation period, then the six-year period for contracts applies because Southern Highlands and Alessi breached the CC &amp; Rs by refusing to provide the superpriority payoff amount.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-48\">\n   As an initial matter, I reject BONY's argument that the limitation period began running when the Supreme Court of Nevada issued the\n   <em>\n    SFR\n   </em>\n   decision. Simply reading the statute that grants HOAs a superpriority lien would have put BONY on notice of the possibility that its deed of trust was in jeopardy. Indeed, its own allegations show the\n   <em>\n    SFR\n   </em>\n   decision was not unanticipated, nor did banks assume that the superpriority lien was not triggered until the deed of trust holder foreclosed, because BONY alleges that its predecessor attempted to pay off the superpriority amount. ECF No. 17 at 5-6. Further,\n   <em>\n    SFR\n   </em>\n   \"did not create new law or overrule existing precedent; rather, that decision declared what NRS 116.3116 has required since the statute's inception.\"\n   <em>\n    K&amp;P Homes v.

The limitation period started running on the date the trustee's deed upon sale was recorded because BONY knew or should have known of its injury at that time.\n   <em>\n    Job's Peak Ranch Cmty.

Douglas Cty.\n   </em>\n   , No. 55572,\n   <extracted-citation index=\"53\" url=\"https://cite.case.law/citations/?q=2015%20WL%205056232\">\n    2015 WL 5056232\n   </extracted-citation>\n   , at *3 (Nev.

This argument is belied by the fact that BONY brings this claim now even though its deed of trust has not been declared extinguished.\n   <em>\n    See\n   </em>\n   <em>\n    Country Garden Owners Ass'n\n   </em>\n   ,\n   <extracted-citation index=\"54\" url=\"https://cite.case.law/citations/?q=2018%20WL%201336721\">\n    2018 WL 1336721\n   </extracted-citation>\n   , at *3 (rejecting a similar argument);\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-50\">\n   <em>\n    U.S. Bank Nat'l Ass'n v.

Nev. Dec. 6, 2016) (same). Because BONY's interest in the property was called into question at the time of the foreclosure sale due to the HOA's superpriority lien, BONY knew as of the foreclosure sale that either its deed of trust was not extinguished so it was not damaged, or its deed of trust was extinguished so it was damaged. No later than when the trustee's deed upon sale was recorded, BONY (or its predecessor) knew the content of the HOA's notices, knew that Southern Highlands had not accepted tender, and knew the property had been sold at a foreclosure sale for $6,140. Thus, based on the amended complaint's allegations, BONY had the facts supporting its contention that the HOA foreclosure sale was improperly conducted as of the date of the foreclosure sale.\n   <em>\n    See\n   </em>\n   <em>\n    Country Garden Owners Ass'n\n   </em>\n   ,\n   <extracted-citation index=\"56\" url=\"https://cite.case.law/citations/?q=2018%20WL%201336721\">\n    2018 WL 1336721\n   </extracted-citation>\n   , at *3 ;\n   <em>\n    Nationstar Mortg., LLC v.

For example, BONY alleges the sale should be equitably set aside and that Southern Highlands or Alessi wrongfully rejected tender.\n   <em>\n    Id.\n   </em>\n   at 11-12. I recently ruled in another case that because a tortious wrongful foreclosure claim could be analogous to many different claims with varying limitation periods depending on the reasons the foreclosure allegedly was wrongful, the claim cannot consistently be analogized to any other type of claim. I thus ruled that the four-year catchall limitation is appropriate for a tortious wrongful foreclosure claim.\n   <em>\n    Deutsche Bank Nat'l Trust Co. v. Absolute Collection Servs., LLC\n   </em>\n   , 2:17-cv-02436-APG-VCF, ECF No. 30 (D. Nev. July 18, 2018). Because BONY filed its complaint more than four years after the HOA foreclosure sale, its tortious wrongful foreclosure claim is untimely, so I dismiss it. However, as with BONY's declaratory relief claim in count one, I grant leave to amend to add facts that would support equitable tolling.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-54\">\n   <strong>\n    E.

But BONY argues that if I disagree, I should certify to that court what statute of limitations governs BONY's claims because there is a lack of consensus on the issue. SFR argues BONY should be estopped from arguing anything other than a five-year limitations period applies because that is what BONY argued to another judge in another case. SFR contends certification is unnecessary because I have already ruled what limitation period applies.
