Jul. 12, 2018). Plaintiffs contend that the Sophie G. case addresses many of the issues pertinent to the defendants' motions for summary judgment. The court agrees. Accordingly, plaintiffs' motion for leave to submit a sur-reply [R. 52] is granted.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-12\">\n   <strong>\n    II. Background\n   </strong>\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-13\">\n   During the 2015-16 and 2016-17 school years, E.E. and M.P. were enrolled in two different elementary schools in the Knox County school system. Both children were prescribed an anti-seizure medication called Diastat. The Knox County Board of Education (KCBE) had in effect a policy that required Diastat to be administered only by a nurse.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-14\">\n   KCBE's 2008 \"Health Services Seizure Disorder Protocol\" states that \"Students with protocol, which requires Diastat rectal medication or oxygen administration, will attend a school (transferred if necessary) where there is a full time on-site nurse.\" The Protocol was updated in 2013, but no change was made to the Diastat administration \"transfer if necessary\" language. The Protocol was updated for a third time in June of 2016. The mandatory language requiring administration of Diastat by a nurse remained, but the \"transfer if necessary\" language was removed.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-15\">\n   Plaintiffs allege that KCBE required students with a Diastat prescription to transfer to a school with a full time nurse if their zoned school was not staffed with a full time nurse, per the Protocol. Plaintiffs contend this violates\n   <extracted-citation index=\"2\" url=\"https://cite.case.law/citations/?q=Tenn.%20Code%20Ann.%20%C2%A7%2049-50-1602\">\n    Tenn. Code Ann. \u00a7 49-50-1602\n   </extracted-citation>\n   (g)(7) : \"An LEA [local education agency] shall not assign a student with epilepsy or other seizure disorder to a school other than the school for which the student is zoned ... because the student has a seizure disorder.\" KCBE and Knox County state that if a student with a Diastat prescription is zoned to attend a particular school that does not have a full time nurse, they offer the student's parents the opportunity to transfer to a school with a nurse. Alternatively, the school system would transfer a full time nurse to the zoned school. Plaintiffs respond they were never offered this option.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-16\">\n   Plaintiffs allege that the Tennessee Department of Education (TDOE) knew KCBE had an illegal policy to transfer students with epilepsy to non-zoned schools and permitted it to continue. Plaintiffs claim that TDOE violated its oversight, supervisory, and monitoring authority over KCBE.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-17\">\n   <strong>\n    A. Plaintiff M.P.\n   </strong>\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-18\">\n   M.P. was scheduled to attend kindergarten at her zoned school, West View Elementary, for the 2016-17 school year. In March 2016, prior to the beginning of the school year, an Individualized Education Plan (IEP) meeting was held for M.P. Her parents did not inform school officials of the Diastat order until after the meeting concluded. Another meeting was planned for May 2016. In April 2016, the principal at Fort Sanders Educational Developmental Center called M.P.'s father about the Diastat prescription. She stated that Diastat required a full time nurse to be at the\n   school and that West View Elementary did not have a full time nurse. She further stated that KCBE had a policy where students with Diastat were transferred to a school with a full time nurse if their zoned school did not have a nurse. She did not say anything about being able to request that a school nurse be installed at West View, just that transfer was required. M.P.'s father examined the 2013 Health Services Protocol, which on its face, was consistent with the principal's explanation. Neither the principal, nor the Protocol, said anything about a student's ability to request that a nurse be provided at West View. M.P.'s father then met with his daughter's neurologist. The neurologist testified the risk of seizures is always present for M.P., even though it is very low. M.P.'s parents decided to discontinue Diastat so M.P. could attend her zoned school. Because West View is .3 of a mile from their home, M.P.'s father determined the removal of Diastat was the lesser of the two evils (the other one being bused to a separate school with no one to administer Diastat on the bus).\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-19\">\n   On February 3, 2017, M.P. filed with TDOE a Due Process Complaint against TDOE, KCBE, and Knox County. No hearing was conducted as the parties agreed the matter was outside the scope of a FAPE (Free Appropriate Public Education).\n   <footnotemark>\n    1\n   </footnotemark>\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-20\">\n   <strong>\n    B. Plaintiff E.E.\n   </strong>\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-21\">\n   When E.E. moved to Tennessee, Copper Ridge was her first zoned school. However, Cooper Ridge lacked a full time nurse. Prior to an IEP meeting, office staff at Copper Ridge called E.E.'s mother and guardian and advised that the IEP meeting would be held at Brickey-McCloud Elementary because, unlike Copper Ridge, it had a full time nurse to administer Diastat. E.E.'s guardian was told it was school policy for E.E. to go to a school with a nurse. Therefore, E.E. would be transferred to the nearest school with a nurse, Brickey-McCloud Elementary. D.H., (E.E.'s guardian) asked whether getting a nurse at Copper Ridge was possible and she was told no, it was not being staffed for a nurse for the upcoming year. The IEP meeting notes specifically state \"The Team will reconvene at a determined location in order to discuss placement in a school with a full time nurse due to seizure disorder.\"\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-22\">\n   E.E. attended Brickey-McCloud Elementary school during the 2015-16 school year. On October 30, 2015, E.E.'s IEP team met at Brickey-McCloud. During the meeting, E.E.'s mother informed the school that she had moved into the Carter Elementary school zone. The IEP team agreed that E.E. should enroll at her zoned school as soon as possible, and that the team would meet again to discuss transitioning services to that school. KCBE was familiar with E.E.'s medical history and knew that E.E. had been prescribed Diastat. KCBE states that Carter Elementary did not (during the 2015-16 school year) offer the special education services required to implement E.E.'s IEP, so E.E. was transferred to East Knox Elementary for special education services. Additionally, East Knox Elementary was staffed by a full time nurse.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-23\">\n   Plaintiffs allege KCBE instructed E.E.'s parent and guardian that E.E. would have\n   to transfer to East Knoxville Elementary because Carter Elementary lacked a full time nurse to administer Diastat.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-24\">\n   In August 2016, an administrative complaint was filed with TDOE. After an investigation, TDOE responded:\n  </p>\n  <blockquote id=\"p-25\">\n   [TDOE] does not find a procedural or substantive violation of federal and state special education laws nor a violation of Student's entitlement to a free and appropriate public education ... the IEP of Student did not require that she be educated in a school other than the school she would attend if non-disabled.\n  </blockquote>\n  <p id=\"p-26\">\n   On February 3, 2017, E.E. filed a Due Process Complaint against TDOE, KCBE, and Knox County. As with M.P., no hearing was conducted because the parties agreed the matter was outside the scope of a FAPE.\n   <em>\n    See\n   </em>\n   fn 1.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-27\">\n   E.E. and M.P. state they were subjected to KCBE's policy and practice of transferring them to a school they would not have attended without the Diastat orders. They were instructed about the Protocol and how they must be transferred; they were never told they could have a nurse at their zoned school; and for E.E., she was specifically told she could not. The court notes that both E.E. and M.P. are currently enrolled at their zoned schools, and their claims concern events occurring during the 2015-16 and 2016-17 school years.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-28\">\n   <strong>\n    III.

Overview of Applicable Law\n   </strong>\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-33\">\n   This case involves three federal laws and one state law, so a survey of\n   these laws will be instructive. The IDEA guarantees individually tailored educational services for children with disabilities, while Title II and Section 504 promise nondiscriminatory access to public institutions for people with disabilities of all ages. That is not to deny some overlap in coverage - the same conduct might violate all three statutes. But still, these statutory differences mean that a complaint bought under Title II and Section 504 might instead seek relief for simple discrimination, irrespective of the IDEA's FAPE obligation. There is also the state law to consider.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-34\">\n   The public education system of Tennessee is set forth in Title 49 of the Tennessee Code.

TDOE also filed a motion to dismiss the administrative complaint arguing the administrative hearing officer lacked jurisdiction. Plaintiffs agreed that sending students with Diastat orders to non-zoned schools is not a violation of a FAPE.

E.E.'s Claim\n   </strong>\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-63\">\n   TDOE contends that E.E. cannot prove that anyone with authority directed her to transfer schools. According to E.E.'s mother, she moved her family to a new home within the Carter Elementary school zone. Over the summer of 2015, she brought E.E.'s application to Carter Elementary and gave it to a woman sitting in the school office. She does not know who the woman was or what her function was, but assumed she was a secretary. This woman looked at E.E.'s application, saw that E.E. had to take medications, and told her E.E. would have to go to another school because Carter did not have a full time nurse. TDOE contends being told by a \"secretary\" is insufficient authority to confer liability. TDOE has only addressed E.E.'s transfer to East Knox Elementary, and fails to address E.E.'s earlier transfer from Copper Ridge Elementary.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-64\">\n   E.E. states that Copper Ridge was her first zoned school. However, Cooper Ridge lacked a full time nurse. Prior to an IEP meeting, office staff at Copper Ridge called E.E.'s mother and guardian and advised that the IEP meeting would be held at Brickey-McCloud Elementary because, unlike Copper Ridge, it had a full time nurse to administer Diastat. E.E.'s guardian was told it was school policy for E.E. to go to a school with a nurse. Therefore, E.E. would be transferred to the nearest school with a nurse, Brickey-McCloud Elementary. Ms. Hartman (E.E.'s guardian) asked whether getting a nurse at Copper Ridge was possible and she was told no, it was not being staffed for a nurse for the upcoming year.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-65\">\n   The same thing occurred in 2015 when E.E.'s family moved to Carter Elementary's school zone. When E.E.'s mother brought the application to the Carter office, the staff person read it and told her Carter did not have a full time nurse, and due to the fact that E.E. needed to take medicine at school, that she would have to go to another school. E.E.'s mother was advised that the IEP meeting would be held at East Knox Elementary.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-66\">\n   Melissa Massie, KCBE's Director of Student Support Services, testified that E.E.'s family should have been advised of the option to have a nurse at the zoned school. However, plaintiffs argue a nurse at the zoned school was never offered or discussed prior to the decision to transfer E.E. to a non-zoned school.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-67\">\n   Records from the TDOE investigation support plaintiff's contentions. TDOE specifically stated the transfer was required due to Diastat. TDOE found \"Student was assigned to Brickey-McCloud Elementary School for the 2015-16 and East Knox Elementary School for the 2016-17 school year due to her requirement for a full time nurse.\"\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-68\">\n   The court finds there are material issues of fact regarding the reason for E.E.'s transfer to non-zoned schools, and TDOE's motion for summary judgment is denied.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-69\">\n   <strong>\n    VI. KNOX COUNTY/KNOX COUNTY BOARD OF EDUCATION\n   </strong>\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-70\">\n   Defendants Knox County and KCBE have jointly moved for summary judgment on plaintiffs' claims under\n   <extracted-citation index=\"66\" url=\"https://cite.case.law/citations/?q=Tenn.%20Code%20Ann.%20%C2%A7%2049-5-1602\">\n    Tenn.

The court will refer to both defendants as KCBE.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-71\">\n   KCBE asserts plaintiffs cannot show a violation of\n   <extracted-citation index=\"67\" url=\"https://cite.case.law/citations/?q=Tenn.%20Code%20Ann.%20%C2%A7%2049-50-1602\">\n    Tenn. Code Ann. \u00a7 49-50-1602\n   </extracted-citation>\n   (g) because its practice is to bring a nurse to the zoned school rather than transfer a student. KCBE states that plaintiffs could have asked that a nurse be provided at their zoned schools, but instead\n   chose to transfer to a non-zoned school (in the case of E.E.) and discontinue the Diastat order (in the case of M.P.).\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-72\">\n   Plaintiffs respond that KCBE's Health Services Protocol mentions nothing about a nurse being provided at the zoned school if requested, but instead states that students will be \"transferred if necessary.\" Plaintiffs further state that KCBE never offered or even told them they had a choice of having a nurse at their zoned schools.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-73\">\n   There are material issues of fact regarding KCBE's official policy, and more importantly here, how that policy was actually administered. The IEP meeting notes for E.E. state \"The team will reconvene at a determined location in order to discuss placement in a school with a full time nurse due to seizure disorder.\" This appears contrary to\n   <extracted-citation index=\"68\" url=\"https://cite.case.law/citations/?q=Tenn.%20Code%20Ann.%20%C2%A7%2049-5-1602\">\n    Tenn.

KCBE staff advised E.E.'s family that Copper Ridge lacked a nurse and that E.E. would have to be transferred. Having a nurse at Copper Ridge was not an option. Again, when E.E. moved to Carter Elementary's school zone, her mother was advised by the school that because E.E. needed to take medicine at school that she would have to go another school, and the IEP meeting would be held at East Knox Elementary. M.P.'s family was instructed by the principal of her school that she could not attend her zoned kindergarten if she required Diastat. Neither family was offered the choice of having a full time nurse installed at the zoned schools.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-75\">\n   Melissa Massie, Director of Student Support Services, testified that the families should have been advised of the option to have a nurse at the zoned school. However, nothing in the record shows that a nurse at their zoned schools was ever offered to plaintiffs.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-76\">\n   Kimberley Kredich, a parent advocate for children with special needs, advocated for M.P. and E.E. in the Knox County School System. She testified that at no time did KCBE ever tell plaintiffs they could have demanded or requested a full time nurse be placed at their zoned schools. The Protocol makes no mention of requesting a nurse and the parents were never advised they could request a nurse at the zoned school.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-77\">\n   Finally, in response to E.E.'s Due Process Complaint, KCBE stated:\n  </p>\n  <blockquote id=\"p-78\">\n   [KCBE] practice is to have only a nurse provide the medication, Diastat, due to the risks that [sic] associated with seizures and this medication. Consistent with this practice, when [E.E.'s] family moved to the Carter Elementary School zone, there was not a full time nurse at this school. The team discussed and offered a transfer to East Knox Elementary with transportation. Parent did not object to the change in schools during the IEP meeting or other meetings with the school staff.\n  </blockquote>\n  <p id=\"p-79\">\n   In the administrative filing, KCBE acknowledged that a full time nurse was not available at Carter Elementary and that E.E. was transferred to East Knox Elementary due to Diastat. Although KCBE now states that E.E.'s special education needs were the reason for her transfer to a non-zoned school, the record contains specific references regarding transfer because of Diastat. These are issues of fact to be resolved at trial, and KCBE's motion for summary judgment is denied.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-80\">\n   <strong>\n    VII.
