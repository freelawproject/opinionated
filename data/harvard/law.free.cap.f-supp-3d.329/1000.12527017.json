From 2009 through 2012, Emma Cline, author of the 2016 best-selling novel\n   <em>\n    The Girls\n   </em>\n   , was romantically involved with writer Chaz Reetz-Laiolo, who is 13 years her senior. She accuses him of domestic abuse and other terrible conduct during and after their relationship. And he accuses her of awful conduct, including stealing his work for her book and intruding into his email and bank accounts, and the email accounts of Kari Bernard, their mutual friend and former roommate, and Kristin Kiesel, a romantic partner of Reetz-Laiolo.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-13\">\n   After a year of trying to settle their dispute out of court, the parties filed separate lawsuits, which were subsequently related. Cline, The Clegg Agency (her literary agent), and Penguin Random House LLC (publisher of\n   <em>\n    The Girls\n   </em>\n   ) bring claims for declaratory judgment of non-infringement and preemption of Reetz-Laiolo's conversion and civil theft claims. Cline also brings a claim for declaratory judgment on\n   certain statutes of limitations. And she asserts claims for conversion, domestic violence, intentional infliction of emotional distress, and tortious interference with prospective economic advantage. He brings claims for copyright infringement, conversion, trespass to chattels, civil theft, and intentional or reckless infliction of emotional distress. Bernard and Kiesel join him in asserting claims under the Federal Stored Communications Act, Federal Wiretap Act, Computer Fraud and Abuse Act, California Invasion of Privacy Act, California Computer Crime Law, the California Constitution, and for intrusion upon seclusion. This order addresses the parties' motions to dismiss.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-14\">\n   <strong>\n    BACKGROUND\n   </strong>\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-15\">\n   <strong>\n    I.

According to Reetz-Laiolo, Cline sent him a G-chat message on November 28, 2014, stating \"i will be exposed as a plagiarizer ... paid 40 bucks to run novel through online plagiarism detector.\" Reetz-Laiolo Am. Compl. \u00b6 162.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-20\">\n   On February 24, 2015, he finally agreed to read the manuscript, but days later changed his mind and asked Cline to \"send him any passages she thought might concern him[.]\" Cline Compl. \u00b6 29.\n   <em>\n    But see\n   </em>\n   Reetz-Laiolo Am.

Cline's\n    <em>\n     The Girls\n    </em>\n   </strong>\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-28\">\n   In 2008, Cline composed three short stories that \"contained the conceptual seeds ... that would develop over the years into\n   <em>\n    The Girls.\n   </em>\n   \" Cline Compl. \u00b6\u00b6 17, 18. Those seeds were \"the close, formative relationship between adolescent girls, the setting of a Sonoma County commune in the 1960s, and the dark underbelly of violence reflected in the Manson Family story[.]\"\n   <em>\n    Id.\n   </em>\n   \u00b6 17. She also incorporated factual details from her life, including information she learned while dating Reetz-Laiolo.\n   <em>\n    Id.\n   </em>\n   \u00b6 19.

That same month, Cline's literary agency (The Clegg Agency) sent the manuscript to publishers, and included the following description of the novel:\n  </p>\n  <blockquote id=\"p-29\">\n   ... Emma Cline returns us to the combustable [sic] summer of 1969 and drops us onto the sun-scorched sidewalks of Marin County behind the bored and troubled eyes of 14-year-old Evie. Stranded in the lonely gulf between recently divorced parents and filled with a desperate restlessness, Evie leans with obsessive abandon into an accidental friendship with an older and beguiling drifter named Suzanne. Wide-eyed and smitten, Evie is easily towed into the turbulent waters of a soon-to-be-infamous commune, quickly finding herself under the sway of a madman and closer than she knows to unthinkable violence. Emma Cline's story of how a rudderless girl finds herself at the flashpoint of a stumbling counter-culture at decade's end delivers a hauntingly precise investigation into how power is lost when we look to find it in others, how frighteningly mutable the unformed, inchoate self can be, and just how far that self will go to be seen and named.\n  </blockquote>\n  <p id=\"p-30\">\n   <em>\n    Id.\n   </em>\n   \u00b6 21;\n   <em>\n    see also\n   </em>\n   Reetz-Laiolo Am.

Reetz-Laiolo's Works\n   </strong>\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-32\">\n   Reetz-Laiolo alleges that Cline stole \"numerous narrative overlaps\" from his\n   <em>\n    All Sea\n   </em>\n   manuscript. Reetz-Laiolo Am. Compl. \u00b6 195. He focuses on \"a sequence of scenes in which the protagonist, a teenager named Gabe, interacts with his single mother when she comes home with her boyfriend, commits burglary at the behest of a friend from whom he wants acceptance, and, after he is caught, is sent away to live with a father figure character named Ray.\" Reetz-Laiolo Am. Compl. \u00b6 197.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-33\">\n   He also includes several \"phrase- and sentence-level instances of plagiarism in the original draft that Cline and Clegg submitted to Random House.\"\n   <em>\n    Id.\n   </em>\n   \u00b6 199.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-34\">\n   Reetz-Laiolo outlines scenes from\n   <em>\n    All Sea\n   </em>\n   -not included in \"Fadein.doc\"-that he suggests Cline incorporated into\n   <em>\n    The Girls.\n   </em>\n   Reetz-Laiolo Am.

The Infidelity\n   </strong>\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-37\">\n   Cline indicates that Reetz-Laiolo was \"habitually unfaithful\" to her. Cline Compl. \u00b6 60. Over the course of the relationship, Reetz-Laiolo's behavior turned violent and abusive.\n   <em>\n    Id.\n   </em>\n   He routinely read her email, text messages, Facebook messages, and personal journal.\n   <em>\n    Id.\n   </em>\n   \u00b6 61. On at least two occasions, he emailed himself \"the entirety of Cline's private journal.\"\n   <em>\n    Id.\n   </em>\n   \u00b6 63. When she attempted to stand up for herself, he would threaten to humiliate her by revealing private facts to her family and friends.\n   <em>\n    Id.\n   </em>\n   \u00b6 61.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-38\">\n   In March 2010, she discovered that he had been sleeping with \"Ms. K,\" his ex-girlfriend.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-39\">\n   <em>\n    Id.\n   </em>\n   \u00b6 59. In the summer of 2010, Cline learned that Ms. K had informed Reetz-Laiolo months earlier that Ms. K had tested positive for a sexually transmitted disease, and \"she had noticed him showing symptoms ... and urged him to tell Cline of her possible exposure.\"\n   <em>\n    Id.\n   </em>\n   \u00b6 66. Reetz-Laiolo did not tell Cline; rather, he continued to have unprotected sex with her.\n   <em>\n    Id.\n   </em>\n   When Cline confronted him, he denied that he was still seeing Ms. K.\n   <em>\n    Id.\n   </em>\n   \u00b6 67.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-40\">\n   <strong>\n    2. The Keylogger Software\n   </strong>\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-41\">\n   In September 2010, \"in an attempt to protect herself from Reetz-Laiolo's prying into her personal documents, the possibility of future sexual transmission of disease, and any other deceptions,\" Cline installed on her computer a free keylogger program from a company called \"Refog.\" Cline Compl. \u00b6 69. The keylogger program recorded keystrokes and collected screenshots on Cline's computer, including the two instances where Reetz-Laiolo emailed himself a copy of Cline's personal journal.\n   <em>\n    Id.\n   </em>\n   \u00b6\u00b6 69-70, 74.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-42\">\n   In February 2011, Reetz-Laiolo promised to stop seeing other women, and Cline decided to uninstall the Refog software and stop accessing his email. Cline Compl. \u00b6 71. On February 10, she told him that she had gained access to his email and that he should change his password.\n   <em>\n    Id.\n   </em>\n   In December 2011, as she was planning to return to Berkeley for winter break, Reetz-Laiolo told her that he had been suffering from symptoms associated with STDs.\n   <em>\n    Id.\n   </em>\n   \u00b6 73. When she arrived in Berkeley, she downloaded on her computer a free three-day trial version of Refog's \"Personal Monitor\" software, which had enhanced functionality.\n   <em>\n    Id.\n   </em>\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-43\">\n   In February 2012, Cline reviewed the activity captured by the Refog software and discovered that Reetz-Laiolo had stolen her personal journal.\n   <em>\n    Id.\n   </em>\n   \u00b6 75. When she confronted him, he assured her he would delete the journal, but he still possesses it.\n   <em>\n    Id.\n   </em>\n   When he asked how she could have known about what he did, she explained the keylogger software to him.\n   <em>\n    Id.\n   </em>\n   The relationship ended soon after, but they remained in contact.\n   <em>\n    Id.\n   </em>\n   \u00b6\u00b6 76-77.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-44\">\n   <strong>\n    3. After the Break-Up\n   </strong>\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-45\">\n   In July 2012, Cline visited Reetz-Laiolo in Berkeley while on summer break from Columbia. Cline Compl. \u00b6 64. He looked through her text messages as she was sleeping, and became so incensed at what he perceived as flirtatious that he deleted the message, held her down on the bed and choked her so violently that she could not breathe.\n   <em>\n    Id.\n   </em>\n   When she said she would call the police, he again threatened to humiliate her by exposing highly personal information to family members.\n   <em>\n    Id.\n   </em>\n   He threw all of her possessions into the street.\n   <em>\n    Id.\n   </em>\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-46\">\n   In December 2012, Reetz-Laiolo asked Cline to sell him her two-year-old laptop for $300, a fraction of its value, because he could not afford a new computer. Cline Compl. \u00b6 77. Cline finally agreed, but indicated that she would wipe the hard drive first.\n   <em>\n    Id.\n   </em>\n   Reetz-Laiolo asked that she leave the computer's applications intact so that he could use her licensed copy of Microsoft Word without paying for a license for himself.\n   <em>\n    Id.\n   </em>\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-47\">\n   In January 2013, Cline brought the computer to a tech professional to have all her personal files transferred to her new computer and deleted from the old one.

Unbeknownst to her, the Refog software, \"which she had accessed only three times in the preceding year[,]\" along with all of the activity it had logged from September 2010 to February 2011 and from December 2011 until January 2013, remained on her computer when she sold it to Reetz-Laiolo.\n   <em>\n    Id.\n   </em>\n   \u00b6\u00b6 78-79. The records included private correspondence, journal entries, intimate web browsing history, and photographs.\n   <em>\n    Id.\n   </em>\n   \u00b6 83.

After the Book Deal\n   </strong>\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-49\">\n   On October 22, 2014, shortly after Cline had informed Reetz-Laiolo that Random House had purchased rights to\n   <em>\n    The Girls\n   </em>\n   , the two met for lunch in San Francisco. Cline Compl. \u00b6 26. He responded that perhaps people would be interested in nude photographs of her given her newfound literary fame.\n   <em>\n    Id.\n   </em>\n   He also told her that he had been contacted by a magazine to write a tell-all article about her, and he planned to do it.\n   <em>\n    Id.\n   </em>\n   After he had reduced Cline to sobbing in public, he told her he was just joking.\n   <em>\n    Id.\n   </em>\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-50\">\n   In February 2015, Reetz-Laiolo informed Cline that the Refog software and the associated data were still on the computer she had sold him. Cline Compl. \u00b6 81. He asked her if she had been remotely accessing the computer, and she informed him she had no way of doing that.\n   <em>\n    Id.\n   </em>\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-51\">\n   In October 2015, after Reetz-Laiolo read the outdated version of the manuscript, he accused Cline of \"vile\" plagiarism and told her \"I wouldn't publish this book if I were you.\" Cline Compl. \u00b6 33. Cline informed her literary agent Bill Clegg, and Clegg informed Cline's editor at Random House.\n   <em>\n    Id.\n   </em>\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-52\">\n   As Reetz-Laiolo \"began to realize the weakness of his copyright claims against Cline,\" he devised a plan to use the Refog records to exploit her and \"extract a financial windfall from Cline and Random House through alternative means.\" Cline Compl. \u00b6\u00b6 84-85. Part of this plan included a theory that Cline accessed the computer remotely, even though Reetz-Laiolo knew that the Refog software did not provide that functionality.\n   <em>\n    Id.\n   </em>\n   \u00b6\u00b6 87-88.

It is told from the perspective of Evie, the teenage protagonist who becomes enthralled with an older teenage girl (Suzanne) and the \"family\" of young women with whom she lives on a compound under the leadership of a charismatic older man. The scenario is meant to emulate the true story of Charles Manson and his cult following. Approximately three-quarters through the novel, Evie joins the girls in their practice of breaking into a private residence and moving the occupant's possessions. The girls escape, but the home owner recognizes Evie. Her mother is angered and sends her to live with her father in Palo Alto. Evie misses Suzanne, and hitchhikes back to the ranch. She joins the group as they are preparing a violent act, but Suzanne orders Evie out of the car and saves her from participating in the murderous rampage.

The social groups are different-in\n   <em>\n    The Girls\n   </em>\n   it is expressed as a \"family\" of young women, in\n   <em>\n    All Sea\n   </em>\n   it is a largely undefined group of older teenagers. The \"stealing\" is dissimilar-in\n   <em>\n    The Girls\n   </em>\n   there is no actual theft. And the remainder of the storyline differs significantly-Evie stays \"away\" for only two weeks before returning to the ranch, whereas Gabe spends the remainder of the story at his Uncle's in Oregon. The commonalities Reetz-Laiolo identifies-an alienated youth, in the care of a single parent, falling in with a bad crowd and/or committing a crime, and being sent away as a result-are merely \"[f]amiliar stock scenes and themes that are staples of literature are not protected.\"\n   <em>\n    Cavalier v.

Ray's gesture: \"We're not gonna have any stealing up here, eh?\" is 12 syllables long, and ends in a subordinate second clause meant to mitigate the gravity of the subject. Carl's gesture: \"I don't have to lock you in your room, do I?\" is 11 syllables long, and ends in a similarly amiable subordinate clause.\n  </blockquote>\n  <blockquote id=\"p-209\">\n   Ray and Carl both continue after neither Gabe nor Evie responds, this time less gently. Ray says, \"You were stealing from people\"; Carl says, \"No breaking into anyone's house?\" Neither uses a softening second clause this time. Both Gabe and Evie respond by nodding.\n  </blockquote>\n  <blockquote id=\"p-210\">\n   Ray says, \"let's get this outta the way\"; Carl visibly relaxes \"like he'd gotten something out of the way.\"\n  </blockquote>\n  <p id=\"p-211\">\n   In the context of labels, the Ninth Circuit has indicated that \"short phrases or expressions cannot be copyrighted, even if they are distinctively arranged or printed.\"\n   <em>\n    Ets-Hokin v.

Opp'n at 32. Both teens feel a sense of isolation and both are experiencing an \"evolving fascination with sexuality[.]\"\n   <em>\n    <extracted-citation case-ids=\"11234798\" index=\"165\" url=\"https://cite.case.law/f3d/225/1068/\">\n     Id.\n    </extracted-citation>\n   </em>\n   And both teens have single mothers who, on one occasion, come home \"loud\" and drunk with their romantic partners in tow and did not speak to the teenage protagonist.\n   <em>\n    Id.\n   </em>\n   at 33.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-214\">\n   As the story proceeds, the teenagers become enthralled with an older social group, and each is given a nickname-\"Little King\" for Gabe and \"Little doll\" for Evie.\n   <em>\n    Id.\n   </em>\n   at 34. The older figures encourage the teenage protagonists to break into an unlocked home-neither takes (or attempts to take) anything of value, both hear the homeowners come home, and both attempt escape by running from the kitchen-Gabe is caught, while Evie escapes, but she is identified.\n   <em>\n    Id.\n   </em>\n   Both single mothers are angered by their child's trespasses, and send each to a father (in\n   <em>\n    The Girls\n   </em>\n   ) or father figure (in\n   <em>\n    All Sea\n   </em>\n   ). In each story, a young woman lives with and works for the father figure, and the teenage protagonist bonds with this woman.\n   <em>\n    Id.\n   </em>\n   at 36-37.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-215\">\n   In the Ninth Circuit, only characters that are \"sufficiently delineated\" and \"especially distinctive\" can be protected by copyright.\n   <em>\n    DC Comics v.

The characters of\n   <em>\n    All Sea\n   </em>\n   do not rise to this level. Gabe is a sensitive youth who likes stability and is repeatedly disappointed by the adults in his life. By contrast, Evie is drawn to instability, which leads her to follow the allure of the girls. Gabe's mother is protective of her son, but struggles to get by, and is prone to drinking and outings with random men. Evie's mother is a financially well-off but insecure divorcee, who searches for external reassurance and pays little attention to Evie. Gabe's \"father figure\" Ray is depicted as direct-antagonizing the local sheriff and pursuing his estranged wife to a fault. Evie's father is presented as an ineffective man who is dominated by his younger girlfriend. He has little impact on Evie's life and the plot. In light of these substantial differences, it is simply not enough for Reetz-Laiolo to argue that both works have a teenage protagonist, a flawed single mother, a father figure, and another young woman.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-216\">\n   <strong>\n    iv. The Mood and The Theme\n   </strong>\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-217\">\n   <em>\n    The Girls\n   </em>\n   is focused on female-centric themes, such as their need for attention and belonging, the intense relationships between them, and the ways in which men seek to manipulate them.\n   <em>\n    All Sea\n   </em>\n   centers around a male coming-of-age story, and his growing maturity despite the lack of a mature father figure to guide him. There is little similarity aside from the coming-of-age.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-218\">\n   Reetz-Laiolo has identified some similarities between the works. But when I parse through the protectable expressions underlying the general ideas highlighted by Reetz-Laiolo, I find that there are few objective similarities, and no substantial ones.
