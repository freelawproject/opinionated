CALDWELL, CHIEF JUDGE\n  </author>\n  <p id=\"p-9\">\n   This matter is before the Court on cross-motions for summary judgment filed by Defendant Lexington-Fayette Urban County Government\n   <footnotemark>\n    1\n   </footnotemark>\n   (DE 55) and Plaintiff Lexington H-L Services, Inc. d/b/a Lexington Herald-Leader (DE 56). The Herald-Leader seeks to permanently enjoin Lexington from enforcing a recently enacted Ordinance which restricts permissible methods of delivering unsolicited written materials within the City. For the reasons set forth below, the Court finds that the Ordinance is a valid time, place, manner regulation of speech and grants summary judgment in favor of Defendant.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-10\">\n   <strong>\n    I. Background\n   </strong>\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-11\">\n   Since October 2014, the Herald-Leader has distributed a free, weekly, non-subscription publication,\n   <em>\n    The Community News\n   </em>\n   , to approximately 130,000 households in Fayette and Jessamine counties.\n   <em>\n    The Community News\n   </em>\n   , which is typically four to six pages in length, contains both local news and advertisements. The Herald-Leader contracts with a distribution partner who distributes\n   <em>\n    The Community News\n   </em>\n   by various means, but primarily via driveway delivery.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-12\">\n   Recognizing that some recipients may not want to receive its unsolicited publication, the Herald-Leader maintains a \"Do Not Deliver\" database. There are a number of ways that residents may be added to the database. The front page of each issue contains a phone number and email for residents to contact and opt-out of delivery. As of April 2017, the database contained 2,899 residents who had opted-out of delivery. Households are also removed if they are listed as \"For Sale.\" And Herald-Leader's distribution partner is instructed not to deliver a new issue of\n   <em>\n    The Community News\n   </em>\n   if there is already one in the driveway from a previous delivery.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-13\">\n   Lexington Councilmembers began receiving written complaints from residents in 2015 regarding delivery of unsolicited materials from the Herald-Leader and other organizations and urging the City to take action to stop these deliveries. Residents described the materials as litter and reported that their attempts to opt-out of delivery were unsuccessful. (DE 55-2.) Residents also complained that materials were left to accumulate at unoccupied homes, were blown around into the street, and remained on the ground for months unless picked up by residents, creating aesthetic and public safety concerns. (DE\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-14\">\n   55-2, 55-3, 55-4, 55-5.) These problems were attributed to the practice of tossing these materials on sidewalks, driveways, and yards from moving vehicles. (DE 55-4, 55-5, 55-6.)\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-15\">\n   As a result of these complaints, the Lexington Planning and Public Safety Committee held a public hearing on August 11, 2015. At the hearing, the Herald-Leader assured the City that it was addressing these complaints and that it had a system in place to ensure copies of\n   <em>\n    The Community News\n   </em>\n   did not accumulate in front of residences and that residents could easily opt-out of delivery. The problem was not solved, however, and the City continued receiving complaints. (DE 55-8, 55-9, 55-10.) One Councilmember who had opted out of delivery even received a copy and complained directly to Rufus Friday, publisher of the Herald-Leader. This prompted him to send an email to the distributor of\n   <em>\n    The Community News\n   </em>\n   describing the problem as \"unacceptable\" and worsened by the fact that it was \"thrown in the street at the edge of her driveway.\" (DE 55-7.)\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-16\">\n   Three more public hearings were held on the issue on October 11, 2016, January 17, 2017, and March 2, 2017, when the Council ultimately approved the Ordinance at issue. Prior to passing the Ordinance, the Committee also considered memorandums submitted by Charles Martin, Director of the Division of Water Quality, and Mark Barnard, the Chief of Police. Director Martin expressed concerns that unsolicited materials tossed on driveways could wash into the public storm sewer system and pollute creeks and streams.\n   <footnotemark>\n    2\n   </footnotemark>\n   He also noted that Lexington was required by an Environmental Protection Agency Consent Decree to educate the public about ways to minimize pollution to the City's waterways. (DE 55-11.) Chief Barnard's memorandum noted that unsolicited materials can leave a neighborhood appearing neglected and there accumulation outside households can indicate that a residence is not surveilled or abandoned, leading to an increased risk of burglary. (DE 55-13.)\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-17\">\n   The Ordinance passed by Lexington restricts the delivery of \"[u]nsolicited written materials\"\n   <footnotemark>\n    3\n   </footnotemark>\n   to six enumerated locations: (1) \"[o]n a porch ... nearest the front door;\" (2) \"securely attached to the front door;\" (3) \"[t]hrough a mail slot;\" (4) \"[b]etween the exterior front door, if one exists and is unlocked, and the interior front door;\" (5) \"in a distribution box;\" or (6) \"[p]ersonally with the owner, occupant, and/or lessee of the premises.\" Ordinance No. 25-2017 \u00a7 14-106(b)(1)-(6). The stated purposes of the Ordinance were reducing \"unwanted litter and visual blight caused by unsolicited written materials\" and preventing damage to and interference with private property.\n   <em>\n    Id.\n   </em>\n   The Ordinance imposes a civil penalty of up to $200 per violation.\n   <em>\n    Id.\n   </em>\n   \u00a7 14-106(h).\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-18\">\n   After the Ordinance was passed, the Herald-Leader commenced this action seeking to enjoin its enforcement on the basis that it abridges the Herald-Leader's First Amendment rights by prohibiting its preferred distribution method-driveway delivery-of\n   <em>\n    The Community News.\n   </em>\n   The\n   Court previously issued a preliminary injunction against enforcement of the Ordinance which was reversed by the Court of Appeals for the Sixth Circuit.\n   <em>\n    See\n   </em>\n   <em>\n    Lexington H-L Servs., Inc. v.

Analysis\n   </strong>\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-22\">\n   The parties present two distinct frameworks for how the Court should decide this case. Lexington contends that the Ordinance is a valid time, place, and manner regulation of speech. Both this Court's previous Opinion and Order and the opinion of the Sixth Circuit, focused on this issue when resolving the Herald-Leader's motion for preliminary injunction. In contrast, the Herald-Leader relies on the Supreme Court's decision in\n   <em>\n    Martin v.

It is reasonable for the City to believe, based on the millions of unsolicited materials delivered each year and numerous complaints from residents that driveway delivery resulted in these materials accumulating, that restricting that form of delivery would reduce this visual blight. The Lexington Ordinance corrects these problems by restricting delivery to six locations were residents are more likely to collect unsolicited materials. Similarly, limiting the delivery to six locations is also likely to create a more consistent esthetic in the City by preventing haphazard distribution of unsolicited materials.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-30\">\n   As to the City's interest in preventing litter, Lexington received complaints that driveway delivery made it more likely that written materials were blown into the street, were they become litter. The Council also considered the memorandum submitted by the City's Director of Division of Water Quality which advised that uncollected materials could wash into the public storm sewer system during heavy rains and end up in the banks of creeks and streams or in streamside vegetation.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-31\">\n   The Herald-Leader claims that there is no evidence that delivery of\n   <em>\n    The Community News\n   </em>\n   causes litter, citing the deposition testimony of Councilmember Farmer. Councilmember Farmer, who voted against the Ordinance, also testified that he believed that the Herald-Leader's opt-out option was an effective means for reducing litter. The belief of one Councilmember, however, does not outweigh the other evidence considered by the City and the opinion of the majority of the Council. The Herald-Leader also points to the City's admission that it has no knowledge of specific storm drains blocked by\n   <em>\n    The Community News\n   </em>\n   and Director Martin's testimony that the EPA has never identified newspapers in storm drains as a problem under Lexington's Consent Decree. These arguments, however, misstate the quantum of evidence required for the Ordinance to be upheld. Upholding \"common sense explanations for ordinances\" like Lexington's \"does not require proof that the problem has occurred in the past or an 'elaborate study of their present-day necessity.' \"\n   <em>\n    Pagan v.

Relying on this passage, the Herald-Leader argues that\n   <em>\n    Martin\n   </em>\n   requires Lexington to permit driveway delivery of unsolicited newspapers unless residents opt-out.

As the court explained, \"the ordinance does not limit its criminal sanction to those who strew papers on lawns or sidewalks, but by its terms covers those who merely enter on property to distribute pamphlets to others who may be there, as well as those who, in delivering pamphlets, take care to secure their messages\n   so as to eliminate the hazards of litter.\"\n   <footnotemark>\n    8\n   </footnotemark>\n   <em>\n    <extracted-citation index=\"96\" url=\"https://cite.case.law/citations/?q=489%20P.2d%20809\">\n     Id.\n    </extracted-citation>\n   </em>\n   ,\n   <extracted-citation index=\"97\" url=\"https://cite.case.law/citations/?q=97%20Cal.%20Rptr.%20777\">\n    97 Cal.Rptr. 777\n   </extracted-citation>\n   ,\n   <extracted-citation index=\"98\" url=\"https://cite.case.law/citations/?q=489%20P.2d%20809\">\n    489 P.2d at 811-12\n   </extracted-citation>\n   . Thus, the ordinance passed by City of Thousand Oaks was broader than both the Ordinance passed by Lexington and the ordinance struck down in\n   <em>\n    Martin\n   </em>\n   as it required \"that a distributor obtain consent prior to the delivery of written material\" which, the court determined, \"as a practical matter [will] frequently operate to curtail completely this means of communication.\"\n   <em>\n    <extracted-citation index=\"99\" url=\"https://cite.case.law/citations/?q=489%20P.2d%20809\">\n     Id.,\n    </extracted-citation>\n   </em>\n   <extracted-citation index=\"100\" url=\"https://cite.case.law/citations/?q=97%20Cal.%20Rptr.%20777\">\n    97 Cal.Rptr. 777\n   </extracted-citation>\n   ,\n   <extracted-citation index=\"101\" url=\"https://cite.case.law/citations/?q=489%20P.2d%20809\">\n    489 P.2d at 813\n   </extracted-citation>\n   . In contrast, Lexington's Ordinance permits the distribution of unsolicited written materials to six specified locations and therefore\n   <em>\n    Van Nuys\n   </em>\n   is inapposite.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-44\">\n   The Herald-Leader also relies on the Third Circuit's decision in\n   <em>\n    Ad World, Inc. v.

Applying intermediate scrutiny, the court found that the ordinance was neither narrowly tailored nor left open ample alternative channels of communication.\n   <em>\n    <extracted-citation case-ids=\"1142350\" index=\"104\" url=\"https://cite.case.law/f2d/672/1136/\">\n     Id.\n    </extracted-citation>\n   </em>\n   <extracted-citation case-ids=\"1142350\" index=\"104\" url=\"https://cite.case.law/f2d/672/1136/\">\n    at 1142\n   </extracted-citation>\n   . The ordinance was aimed at reducing burglary due to accumulation of unwanted papers, but the regulation applied only to advertising materials while other \"publications [which] could lead to similar accumulation and the same attendant risks\" were exempted.\"\n   <em>\n    <extracted-citation case-ids=\"1142350\" index=\"105\" url=\"https://cite.case.law/f2d/672/1136/\">\n     Id.\n    </extracted-citation>\n   </em>\n   <extracted-citation case-ids=\"1142350\" index=\"105\" url=\"https://cite.case.law/f2d/672/1136/\">\n    at 1141\n   </extracted-citation>\n   . In contrast, recognizing that unsolicited materials are most likely to go uncollected, the Lexington ordinance applies equally to all unsolicited written material regardless of its content. Additionally, the Doylestown ordinance was also broader in scope, prohibiting all distribution of unsolicited advertisements. Ad World sought to deliver its advertisement by \"attach[ing] the paper in a plastic bag to a mailbox hook or to a door knob or leave it on the premises.\"\n   <em>\n    <extracted-citation case-ids=\"1142350\" index=\"106\" url=\"https://cite.case.law/f2d/672/1136/\">\n     Id.\n    </extracted-citation>\n   </em>\n   <extracted-citation case-ids=\"1142350\" index=\"106\" url=\"https://cite.case.law/f2d/672/1136/\">\n    at 1138\n   </extracted-citation>\n   . Thus, when the Third Circuit cited to\n   <em>\n    Martin\n   </em>\n   , it was for the conclusion that \"a publisher ... is a fortiori protected in having a paper delivered door to door and having it\n   <em>\n    left on the front steps or on the mailbox\n   </em>\n   of a home.\"\n   <em>\n    <extracted-citation case-ids=\"1142350\" index=\"107\" url=\"https://cite.case.law/f2d/672/1136/\">\n     Id.\n    </extracted-citation>\n   </em>\n   (emphasis added). Lexington's Ordinance does not prohibit this type of delivery and therefore\n   <em>\n    Ad World\n   </em>\n   is inapplicable.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-45\">\n   The Herald-Leader cites a number of additional state cases and a single decision from the Eastern District of New York but fails to explain why the Court should rely on these cases rather than the Sixth Circuit's binding precedent in\n   <em>\n    Jobe.\n   </em>\n   The Herald-Leader has strained to present\n   <em>\n    Martin\n   </em>\n   as creating a right to provide unsolicited driveway delivery when neither it, nor its most pertinent progeny, specifically addressed that issue. Properly understood,\n   <em>\n    Martin\n   </em>\n   stands for the proposition that a government may not place a total prohibition on door-to-door solicitation and leafletting. Outside of that context, and in this circuit,\n   <em>\n    Jobe\n   </em>\n   provides the applicable time, place, manner analysis for assessing whether content-neutral restrictions on distribution of written materials are constitutional.
