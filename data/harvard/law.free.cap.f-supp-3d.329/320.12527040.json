Code Civ. Proc. art. 1871 with regard to its subcontract with Defendant, Engineering Design Technologies, Inc. (\"EDT\"). More specifically, Yor-Wic is requesting this Court find the subcontract invalid, null, unenforceable, extinguished and/or without cause or consent.\n   <em>\n    See\n   </em>\n   Record Document 1-1 at p. 3, \u00b6\u00b6 14-17, State Court Petition. EDT filed a Partial Motion\n   to Dismiss pursuant to Federal Rule of Civil Procedure 12(b)(6).\n   <em>\n    See\n   </em>\n   Record Document 30. However, the present Motion is more appropriately classified as a Partial Motion for Judgment on the Pleadings pursuant to Federal Rule of Civil Procedure 12(c), which will be discussed further\n   <em>\n    infra.\n   </em>\n   The Court having considered EDT's Partial Motion for Judgment on the Pleadings (Record Document 30), the Motion is\n   <strong>\n    GRANTED IN PART AND DENIED IN PART\n   </strong>\n   .\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-10\">\n   <strong>\n    I. BACKGROUND\n   </strong>\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-11\">\n   On January 3, 2017, Yor-Wic filed the present lawsuit, styled as a \"Petition for Declaratory Judgment with Reservation of other Actions and Defenses,\" against EDT in the 26th Judicial District Court for the Parish of Bossier, State of Louisiana.\n   <em>\n    See\n   </em>\n   Record Document 1-1, Original Petition. This suit was initiated by Yor-Wic because EDT defaulted Yor-Wic for non-performance. According to the original Petition, EDT entered into a contract (the \"prime contract\") with the Naval Facilities Engineering Command, Southeast (\"NAVFAC\") for construction of drainage improvements at Barksdale Air Force Base.\n   <em>\n    See id.\n   </em>\n   at p.1, \u00b6 3. EDT, in turn, entered into a March 30, 2016, agreement (the \"subcontract\") with Yor-Wic to perform work under the prime contract.\n   <em>\n    See id.\n   </em>\n   at p. 2, \u00b6 5.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-12\">\n   The prime contract specified that EDT should not enter into any contract with a subcontractor who did not comply with the requisite Experience Modification Rate (\"EMR\").\n   <em>\n    See id.\n   </em>\n   at \u00b6 8. Prior to the execution of the subcontract, Yor-Wic alleges that it advised EDT that its EMR exceeded the maximum permitted by the prime contract.\n   <em>\n    See id.\n   </em>\n   at p. 3, \u00b6 9. Thereafter, EDT submitted Yor-Wic's EMR to NAVFAC, but NAVFAC rejected Yor-Wic as a subcontractor.\n   <em>\n    See id.\n   </em>\n   at \u00b6 10. Following the initial rejection, \"EDT submitted a written request for additional consideration to the [c]ontracting [o]fficer due to Yor-Wic's failure to meet the specified acceptable EMR range, but NAVFAC refused to approve Yor-Wic as a subcontractor to EDT for the [p]roject.\"\n   <em>\n    Id.\n   </em>\n   at \u00b6 11.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-13\">\n   In its original Petition, Yor-Wic contends that the subcontract, by incorporating the EMR, included a suspensive condition that NAVFAC must approve Yor-Wic as a subcontractor for the project.\n   <footnotemark>\n    1\n   </footnotemark>\n   <em>\n    See id.\n   </em>\n   at \u00b6 12. Because of the failure of the suspensive condition, Yor-Wic seeks a judgment declaring the subcontract invalid, void, null, unenforceable, extinguished, and/or without cause or consent.\n   <em>\n    See id.\n   </em>\n   at p. 4, \u00b6 15. In addition, Yor-Wic seeks the same declaration as to the payment and performance bonds that secured performance of the subcontract.\n   <em>\n    See id.\n   </em>\n   at \u00b6\u00b6 16-17.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-14\">\n   On February 1, 2017, EDT removed the case to federal court on the basis of diversity jurisdiction,\n   <extracted-citation index=\"0\" url=\"https://cite.case.law/citations/?q=28%20U.S.C.%20%C2%A7%201332\">\n    28 U.S.C. \u00a7 1332\n   </extracted-citation>\n   . Also on February 1, Yor-Wic filed a Motion for Leave to File First Amending and Supplemental Petition and Incorporated Memorandum, and this Court administratively entered Yor-Wic's First Amending, Supplemental and Restated Petition on February 19, 2017.\n   <em>\n    See\n   </em>\n   Record Document 9-1 at p. 26. In Yor-Wic's amended Petition, it added several more claims including equitable estoppel, impossibility of performance based on a fortuitous event, subjective novation, nullity based on an alleged\n   False Claims Act violation and lack of consent due to error as to person.\n   <em>\n    See\n   </em>\n   Record Document 9-1 at p. 34, \u00b6\u00b6 20-25, Amended Petition. EDT filed an original and amended Answer with affirmative defenses and counterclaims against Yor-Wic based on Yor-Wic's alleged termination for default due to Yor-Wic's unilateral abandonment of the work, not due to any EMR rating non-compliance.\n   <em>\n    See\n   </em>\n   Record Document 13; Record Document 30-1 at p. 7; Record Document 32.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-15\">\n   <strong>\n    II.

Yor-Wic pleads that subsequent to rejection by NAVFAC of Yor-Wic as the subcontractor, it learned that EDT was in an undisclosed joint venture with ACC Construction Co., Inc. (\"ACC\").\n   <em>\n    See\n   </em>\n   Record Document 9-1 at p. 35, \u00b6 25. Yor-Wic argues that the principal cause for Yor-Wic in the subcontract was the payment of $6,578,183.46, which was solely in the hands of the undisclosed joint venture, ACC-EDT JOINT VENTURE LLC.\n   <em>\n    See\n   </em>\n   Record Document 39 at p. 21.

Yor-Wic's willingness to enter into the subcontract despite its awareness that NAVFAC could potentially reject Yor-Wic due to its high EMR and the fact the subcontract was worth $6,578,183.46 supports the Court's conclusion.

This can be accomplished without the consent of the prior obligor, unless the prior obligor still had an interest in performing the obligation.\n   <em>\n    Id.\n   </em>\n   ;\n   <em>\n    see\n   </em>\n   La. Civ. Code art. 1882. Moreover, an essential requisite to confect a subjective novation is the express discharge of the debtor from his obligation.\n   <em>\n    See\n   </em>\n   <em>\n    Baron v. Guidry\n   </em>\n   , 17 La. Ct. App. 32, 34,\n   <extracted-citation index=\"69\" url=\"https://cite.case.law/citations/?q=134%20So.%20410\">\n    134 So. 410\n   </extracted-citation>\n   , 411 (1st Cir. 1931).\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-51\">\n   Yor-Wic alleges that EDT made \"multiple representations in writing and conduct ... to NAVFAC subsequent to the rejection ... of Yor-Wic as a subcontractor ... [and] confirm[ed] that other entities were to become the construction subcontractor.\" Record Document 9-1 at p. 34, \u00b6 23. This allegation, at this stage in the litigation, can reasonably be construed as an express discharge by EDT of Yor-Wic as the subcontractor. Furthermore, this allegation, taken as true, supports Yor-Wic's claim under La. Civ. Code art. 1882 because new obligors were allegedly substituted for Yor-Wic, a prior obligor. Upon review of Yor-Wic's amended Petition and its Memorandum in Opposition, Yor-Wic has sufficiently pleaded facts that would support its subjective novation claim.\n   <em>\n    See\n   </em>\n   Record Document 9-1 at p. 34, \u00b6 23; Record Document 39 at p. 21. Accordingly, EDT's Motion for Partial Judgment on the Pleadings as to Yor-Wic's subjection novation claim is hereby\n   <strong>\n    DENIED.\n   </strong>\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-52\">\n   <strong>\n    G. False Claims Act.\n   </strong>\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-53\">\n   In its Memorandum in Opposition to EDT's Partial Motion for Judgment on the Pleadings, Yor-Wic states that it did not assert a cause of action under the False Claims Act pursuant to\n   <extracted-citation index=\"70\" url=\"https://cite.case.law/citations/?q=31%20U.S.C.%20%C2%A7%203729\">\n    31 U.S.C. \u00a7 3729\n   </extracted-citation>\n   .\n   <em>\n    See\n   </em>\n   Record Document 39 at p. 25. Accordingly, the Court finds that any subsequent claim by Yor-Wic under the False Claims Act is hereby\n   <strong>\n    WAIVED\n   </strong>\n   . Furthermore, pursuant to Federal Rule of Civil Procedure 12(f), paragraph 24 in Yor-Wic's First Amending and Supplemental Petition is hereby stricken from the record.\n   <em>\n    See\n   </em>\n   Fed. R. Civ. P. 12(f) (a \"court may strike from a pleading an insufficient defense or any redundant,\n   immaterial, impertinent, or scandalous matter.\").

EDT intends to address Yor-Wic's suspensive condition theory in a subsequent Fed. R. Civ. P. 56, motion for summary judgment.\n    <em>\n     See\n    </em>\n    Record Document 30-1 at p. 10, EDT's Memorandum in Support of Partial Motion for Judgment on the Pleadings.\n   </p>\n  </footnote>\n  <footnote label=\"2\">\n   <p id=\"p-61\">\n    Under Louisiana law the concepts of \"error\" and \"failure of cause\" are one in the same.\n    <em>\n     See\n    </em>\n    <em>\n     Chalos &amp; Co., P.C. v.

La. Oct. 23, 2015). Yor-Wic in its original and amended Petition asserts that the subcontract lacks cause. To avoid confusion, the Court will refer to Yor-Wic's claim on this point as \"error.\"\n   </p>\n  </footnote>\n  <footnote label=\"3\">\n   <p id=\"p-62\">\n    After review of the pertinent pleadings, Yor-Wic has failed to plead other causes for entering into the subcontract in its original and amended Petitions as well as its Memorandum in Opposition to EDT's Partial Motion for Judgment on the Pleadings. Furthermore, the only error that can be ascertained by the Court concerns Yor-Wic's contention that an undisclosed joint venture by EDT constitutes an error.\n    <em>\n     See\n    </em>\n    Record Document 9-1 at p. 35, \u00b6 25. Accordingly, the Court finds that Yor-Wic's cause for entering into the subcontract with EDT was the $6,578,183.46 prospective payment and the error bears on the person or qualities of the other party. Since Yor-Wic has failed to raise and support with both facts and law other legal theories for its error claim in order to vitiate its consent to the subcontract, the Court deems any arguments in the future\n    <strong>\n     WAIVED\n    </strong>\n    .\n    <em>\n     See\n    </em>\n    <em>\n     Campbell v.

Yor-Wic advances this argument in order for the Court to find the subcontract null. Because this argument was not raised by EDT in its Memorandum in Support or its Reply Memorandum, the Court cannot address it\n    <em>\n     sua sponte.\n    </em>\n   </p>\n  </footnote>\n  <footnote label=\"5\">\n   <p id=\"p-64\">\n    The Court recognizes that the Revision Comments to the Louisiana Civil Code are not law.
