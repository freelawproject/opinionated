(ECF No. 5.) On June 4, 2018, the Federal Defendants filed a response in opposition (ECF No. 19). For the reasons set forth below, the court\n   <strong>\n    GRANTS\n   </strong>\n   the State's Motion for Preliminary Injunction (ECF No. 5).\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-10\">\n   <strong>\n    I. RELEVANT FACTUAL AND PROCEDURAL BACKGROUND\n   </strong>\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-11\">\n   Following the end of the Cold War and the collapse of the Soviet Union, significant quantities of nuclear weapons, including large amounts of weapons grade plutonium, became surplus to the defense needs of the United States and Russia. Control of these surplus materials became an urgent U.S. foreign policy goal, with a particular focus on nuclear weapons. In an effort to consolidate and reduce surplus weapons-grade plutonium, the United States and Russia jointly developed a plan for the nonproliferation of weapons of mass destruction worldwide.\n   <footnotemark>\n    1\n   </footnotemark>\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-12\">\n   After extensive study, including an environmental impact statement (\"EIS\") conducted pursuant to National Environmental Policy Act,\n   <extracted-citation index=\"0\" url=\"https://cite.case.law/citations/?q=42%20U.S.C.%20%C2%A7%C2%A7%204321\">\n    42 U.S.C.A. \u00a7\u00a7 4321\n   </extracted-citation>\n   - 4370h (\"NEPA\") in 1996, DOE concluded that the \"preferred alternative\" for plutonium disposition consisted of a dual-path strategy that proposed (1) immobilization of a portion of the surplus plutonium in glass or ceramic materials and (2) irradiation of the remaining plutonium in MOX fuel. DOE also analyzed the environmental impacts of various alternatives for the \"long term\" storage of plutonium and other nuclear materials for up to fifty years.\n   <footnotemark>\n    2\n   </footnotemark>\n   The following year, DOE announced its intention to pursue this dual-path strategy, including the construction and operation of a MOX fuel fabrication facility.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-13\">\n   In November 1999, after further evaluating the alternatives for surplus plutonium disposition, DOE issued the\n   <em>\n    Surplus Plutonium Disposition Final EIS\n   </em>\n   (\"SPD EIS\").\n   <footnotemark>\n    3\n   </footnotemark>\n   DOE also analyzed a \"No Action Alternative\" that did not involve disposition of any surplus plutonium but rather addressed storage of the plutonium in accordance with its previous analysis of the impacts of continued storage of the surplus plutonium for a period up to 50 years.\n   <footnotemark>\n    4\n   </footnotemark>\n   DOE again concluded that the \"Preferred Alternative\" was the hybrid approach to immobilize surplus weapons-grade plutonium in glass and ceramic materials and to irradiate the remaining plutonium in MOX fuel in existing domestic, commercial reactors.\n   <footnotemark>\n    5\n   </footnotemark>\n   DOE selected SRS as the preferred site to implement both of these approaches\n   and upon which to construct and operate the MOX Facility.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-14\">\n   In 1999, DOE signed a contract with a consortium, now CB&amp;I AREVA MOX Services, LLC (\"MOX Services\"), to design, build, and operate the MOX Facility.\n   <footnotemark>\n    6\n   </footnotemark>\n   On or about February 28, 2001, MOX Services submitted a request to the U.S. Nuclear Regulatory Commission (\"NRC\") for a license to construct the MOX Facility at SRS.\n   <footnotemark>\n    7\n   </footnotemark>\n   In late 2001, Congress directed DOE to provide, not later than February 1, 2002, a plan for the disposal of surplus defense plutonium located at SRS and to be shipped to SRS in the future. Congress also required the Secretary of Energy to:\n  </p>\n  <blockquote id=\"p-15\">\n   \u2022 Consult with the Governor of South Carolina regarding \"any decisions or plans of the Secretary related to the disposition of surplus defense plutonium and defense plutonium materials located at [SRS];\"\n  </blockquote>\n  <blockquote id=\"p-16\">\n   \u2022 Submit a report to the congressional defense committees providing notice for each shipment of defense plutonium and defense plutonium materials to SRS;\n  </blockquote>\n  <blockquote id=\"p-17\">\n   \u2022 If DOE decides not to proceed with construction of the immobilization facilities or the MOX Facility, prepare a plan that identifies a disposition path for all defense plutonium and defense plutonium materials; and\n  </blockquote>\n  <blockquote id=\"p-18\">\n   \u2022 Include with the budget justification materials submitted to Congress in support of DOE's budget for each fiscal year \"a report setting forth the extent to which amounts requested for the [DOE] for such fiscal year for fissile materials disposition activities will enable the [DOE] to meet commitments for the disposition of surplus defense plutonium and defense plutonium materials located at [SRS]....\"\n   <footnotemark>\n    8\n   </footnotemark>\n  </blockquote>\n  <p id=\"p-19\">\n   In 2002, DOE decided not to proceed with the immobilization portion of the hybrid strategy, leaving the construction and operation of the MOX Facility as the only strategy to dispose of surplus plutonium in the United States. In 2003, Congress enacted statutory requirements for DOE's construction and operation of the MOX Facility.\n   <footnotemark>\n    9\n   </footnotemark>\n   Specifically, Section 2566 provides the Congressional mandate for the \"construction and operation of [the MOX Facility]\" and requires DOE to achieve the \"MOX production objective\" by producing mixed-oxide fuel from defense plutonium and defense plutonium materials at an average rate of no less than one metric ton of mixed-oxide fuel per year.\n   <footnotemark>\n    10\n   </footnotemark>\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-20\">\n   In 2005, DOE began transferring plutonium to SRS for conversion into MOX fuel.\n   <footnotemark>\n    11\n   </footnotemark>\n   This plutonium was in addition to the several tons of plutonium that already existed at SRS. On or about March 30,\n   2005, after its own evaluation and analysis, NRC issued a license for construction to MOX Services finding, among other things, that radiation exposure to the public is greater in a \"no action\" alternative than with the Project and noting that \"continued storage would result in higher annual impacts\" of public radiation exposure than implementation of the Project.\n   <footnotemark>\n    12\n   </footnotemark>\n   Construction began on the MOX Facility on or about August 1, 2007.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-21\">\n   In 2014, the Federal Defendants sought to abandon the Project by trying to place the MOX Facility into \"cold standby.\" The State filed a lawsuit before the court, and the Federal Defendants then agreed to continue construction of the Project in compliance with law. The case was resolved through a stipulation of dismissal and dismissed without prejudice.\n   <footnotemark>\n    13\n   </footnotemark>\n   Since then, DOE's budget requests have all requested funding to terminate construction of the MOX Facility. However, Congress has specifically required the DOE and NNSA to utilize any MOX-specific appropriations for the construction of the MOX Facility, denying and rebuffing the attempts by DOE and NNSA to utilize Congressional appropriations to terminate the Project. Nevertheless, DOE has continuously sought termination of the MOX Project and has advocated for its proposed \"Dilute and Dispose\" alternative (also referred to as \"downblending\"), under which DOE would prepare surplus non-pit plutonium at SRS for disposal at the Waste Isolation Pilot Plant (\"WIPP\") near Carlsbad, New Mexico.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-22\">\n   On December 20, 2017, the court issued an Injunction Order instructing the Federal Defendants that within two years from the entry of the Order, they \"must remove from the State of South Carolina, for storage or disposal elsewhere, not less than one metric ton of defense plutonium or defense plutonium materials, as defined by\n   <extracted-citation index=\"1\" url=\"https://cite.case.law/citations/?q=50%20U.S.C.%20%C2%A7%202566\">\n    50 U.S.C. \u00a7 2566\n   </extracted-citation>\n   .\" (\n   <em>\n    See\n   </em>\n   <em>\n    State of South Carolina v.

(\n   <em>\n    See\n   </em>\n   ECF No. 5). On June 4, 2018, the Federal Defendants filed a response in opposition (ECF No. 19), and on June 6,\n   2018, the State filed a reply (ECF No. 21).

Defenders of Wildlife\n   </em>\n   ,\n   <extracted-citation case-ids=\"11730070\" index=\"3\" url=\"https://cite.case.law/us/504/555/#p560\">\n    504 U.S. 555\n   </extracted-citation>\n   , 560-61,\n   <extracted-citation case-ids=\"11730070\" index=\"4\" url=\"https://cite.case.law/us/504/555/#p560\">\n    112 S.Ct. 2130\n   </extracted-citation>\n   ,\n   <extracted-citation case-ids=\"11730070\" index=\"5\" url=\"https://cite.case.law/us/504/555/#p560\">\n    119 L.Ed.2d 351\n   </extracted-citation>\n   (1992). Further, standing is established when a plaintiff's legal action arguably falls within the \"zone of interests\" Congress intended to protect.\n   <em>\n    See, e.g.,\n   </em>\n   <em>\n    Clarke v. Sec. Indus. Ass'n\n   </em>\n   ,\n   <extracted-citation case-ids=\"6217100\" index=\"6\" url=\"https://cite.case.law/us/479/388/#p399\">\n    479 U.S. 388\n   </extracted-citation>\n   , 399,\n   <extracted-citation case-ids=\"6217100\" index=\"7\" url=\"https://cite.case.law/us/479/388/#p399\">\n    107 S.Ct. 750\n   </extracted-citation>\n   ,\n   <extracted-citation case-ids=\"6217100\" index=\"8\" url=\"https://cite.case.law/us/479/388/#p399\">\n    93 L.Ed.2d 757\n   </extracted-citation>\n   (1987) (\"The \"zone of interest\" test is a guide for deciding whether, in view of Congress' evident intent to make agency action presumptively reviewable, a particular plaintiff should be heard to complain of a particular agency decision.\").\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-35\">\n   <em>\n    1. Injury in Fact\n   </em>\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-36\">\n   The State has alleged three separate injuries. (ECF No. 21 at 3.) The State alleges an economic injury, a procedural injury, and an environmental injury. (\n   <em>\n    Id.\n   </em>\n   ) The Federal Defendants challenge the sufficiency of each of these injuries to fulfil the injury in fact requirement to support standing.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-37\">\n   The State asserts two forms of economic injury. First, the State argues that it will suffer an economic injury as a result of the decreased tax revenue stemming from the termination of the MOX Project. (ECF No. 5 at 26.) In short, the State's argument is that the employees at the MOX Project pay taxes to the State, and the termination of the MOX Project would lead to their unemployment, which would decrease the State's tax revenues. However, a state cannot bring a\n   <em>\n    parens patriae\n   </em>\n   action on behalf of its citizens to protect them from actions by the federal government.\n   <em>\n    Massachusetts v. Mellon\n   </em>\n   ,\n   <extracted-citation case-ids=\"6142497\" index=\"9\" url=\"https://cite.case.law/us/262/447/#p485\">\n    262 U.S. 447\n   </extracted-citation>\n   , 485-86,\n   <extracted-citation case-ids=\"6142497\" index=\"10\" url=\"https://cite.case.law/us/262/447/#p485\">\n    43 S.Ct. 597\n   </extracted-citation>\n   ,\n   <extracted-citation case-ids=\"6142497\" index=\"11\" url=\"https://cite.case.law/us/262/447/#p485\">\n    67 L.Ed. 1078\n   </extracted-citation>\n   (1923).\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-38\">\n   Further, the State's assertion that it is injured because individuals who are no longer employed on the construction of the MOX Facility will not pay the same amount of income taxes to the State fails to constitute an injury in fact. If a state is allowed to sue the federal government any time any federal action causes a generalized economic harm, such suits would dramatically expand the circumstances under which state governments are able to sue the United States. The courts that have considered such theories have accordingly rejected the notion that a state government can sue the United States based on such harm.\n   <em>\n    See\n   </em>\n   <em>\n    Pennsylvania v. Kleppe\n   </em>\n   ,\n   <extracted-citation case-ids=\"3697266,1003797\" index=\"12\" url=\"https://cite.case.law/f2d/533/668/\">\n    533 F.2d 668\n   </extracted-citation>\n   , 672 (D.C. Cir. 1976) (\"the unavoidable economic repercussions of virtually all federal policies suggest[s] to us that impairment of state revenues should not, in general, be recognized as sufficient injury in fact to support state standing.\");\n   <em>\n    Iowa ex rel. Miller v. Block\n   </em>\n   ,\n   <extracted-citation case-ids=\"338339\" index=\"13\" url=\"https://cite.case.law/f2d/771/347/#p353\">\n    771 F.2d 347\n   </extracted-citation>\n   , 353 (8th Cir. 1985).\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-39\">\n   Secondly, the State posits that the termination of the Project would result in an economic injury because it was supposed to be an economic benefit to the State. (ECF No. 21 at 3.) The State quotes the Bob Stump National Defense Authorization Act for Fiscal Year 2003, which states that the MOX Project \"will also be economically beneficial to the State of South Carolina, and that economic benefit will not be fully realized unless the MOX facility is built.\" Pub. L. No. 107-314,\n   <extracted-citation index=\"14\" url=\"https://cite.case.law/citations/?q=116%20Stat.%202458\">\n    116 Stat. 2458\n   </extracted-citation>\n   , Subtitle E, \u00a7 3181. It is true that the MOX Project would have economic benefit for the State. However, the court does not\n   equate a statement of purpose with the creation of a cause of action. Therefore, this theory also fails to satisfy the injury in fact requirement.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-40\">\n   The State also argues that it suffered two procedural harms as a result of the May 10, 2018 decisions. First, the State alleges that the Federal Defendants failed to adequately consult the Governor of South Carolina, as required by\n   <extracted-citation index=\"15\" url=\"https://cite.case.law/citations/?q=50%20U.S.C.%20%C2%A7%202567\">\n    50 U.S.C. \u00a7 2567\n   </extracted-citation>\n   (a), prior to making a decision \"related to the disposition of surplus defense plutonium and defense plutonium materials located at the Savannah River Site, Aiken, South Carolina,\" \u00a7 2567(a). (ECF No. 21 at 3.) Courts have held that while it is difficult to quantify the exact effect of a failure to consult, the party is clearly injured.\n   <em>\n    See\n   </em>\n   <em>\n    Cal. Wilderness Coal. v. U.S. Dep't of Energy\n   </em>\n   ,\n   <extracted-citation case-ids=\"4086214\" index=\"16\" url=\"https://cite.case.law/f3d/631/1072/#p1087\">\n    631 F.3d 1072\n   </extracted-citation>\n   , 1087 (9th Cir. 2011) (\"[W]e note that although the nature of consultation makes it difficult to determine the precise consequences of its absence, the prejudice to the party excluded is obvious.\"). Thus, the Federal Defendants' failure to consult with the Governor prior to making a decision regarding the MOX Project creates an injury in fact.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-41\">\n   Additionally, the State argues that it has suffered an injury in fact because of the Federal Defendants' failure to conform with the requirements of NEPA. (ECF No. 21 at 2.) \"[I]ndividuals living next to [a federal project requiring NEPA analysis] possess standing to challenge a failure to comply with NEPA.\"\n   <em>\n    Hodges v. Abraham\n   </em>\n   ,\n   <extracted-citation case-ids=\"11420401\" index=\"17\" url=\"https://cite.case.law/f3d/300/432/#p444\">\n    300 F.3d 432\n   </extracted-citation>\n   , 444-45 (4th Cir. 2002) (citing\n   <em>\n    Lujan\n   </em>\n   ,\n   <extracted-citation case-ids=\"11730070\" index=\"18\" url=\"https://cite.case.law/us/504/555/#p560\">\n    504 U.S. at\n   </extracted-citation>\n   572 n.7,\n   <extracted-citation case-ids=\"11730070\" index=\"19\" url=\"https://cite.case.law/us/504/555/#p560\">\n    112 S.Ct. 2130\n   </extracted-citation>\n   ). Similar to Governor Hodges, the plaintiff in\n   <em>\n    Hodges\n   </em>\n   , the State has standing here to challenge the Federal Defendants' failure to comply with NEPA because the State owns extensive property adjoining, and one road traversing, the impacted area. (\n   <em>\n    See\n   </em>\n   ECF No. 1 at \u00b6 5.)\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-42\">\n   Lastly, the State argues that it has suffered an environmental injury as a result of the May 10, 2018 decisions. \"[W]hen a decision to which NEPA obligations attach is made without the informed environmental considerations that NEPA requires, the harm that NEPA intends to prevent has been suffered.\"\n   <em>\n    W. N.C. All. v. N.C.

It is the State's environment that is placed at risk as a result of the Federal Defendants' failure to comply with NEPA. Therefore, the State has suffered an injury in fact.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-43\">\n   Accordingly, the State has suffered procedural and environmental harms such that it has satisfied the injury in fact requirement.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-44\">\n   <em>\n    2. Causation and Redressability\n   </em>\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-45\">\n   The procedural and environmental injuries discussed above are directly traceable to the Federal Defendants' decision to terminate the MOX Facility. The court is able to redress the procedural and environmental injuries.

(ECF No. 19 at 20-22.) This assertion is directly refuted by the Federal Defendants' own affidavits. In support of their Response, the Federal Defendants submitted the declaration of Robert Raines, the DOE official responsible for MOX construction (and MOX termination), who testified:\n  </p>\n  <blockquote id=\"p-51\">\n   The Secretary exercised the authorities given to him by the Congress on May 10, 2018 and on May 14, 2018 a partial stop work order was issued to minimize cos[t] to the government during the 30 day period leading up to an eventual full stop work order and\n   <em>\n    the termination letter expected to be issued on June 11, 2018.\n   </em>\n  </blockquote>\n  <p id=\"p-52\">\n   (ECF No. 19-1 \u00b6 10) (emphasis added). Mr. Raines further testified regarding the \"issuance of the NNSA Contract Termination Notice [for June 11, 2018,]\" (\n   <em>\n    id.\n   </em>\n   \u00b6 18), the \"termination notice date,\" (\n   <em>\n    id.\n   </em>\n   \u00b6 19), and the \"termination of the MOX Project,\" (\n   <em>\n    id.\n   </em>\n   \u00b6 20). In addition, the Federal Defendants submitted the declaration of William Harris Walker, NNSA Director of Intergovernmental Affairs, who testified about \"\n   <em>\n    the execution of the MOX termination waiver.\n   </em>\n   \" (ECF No. 19-9 \u00b6 7) (emphasis added). Accordingly, the Federal Defendants' contention that there has not been a final agency action to terminate the MOX Facility is directly refuted by the evidence submitted by the Federal Defendants and the practical reality that the full stop work order that is planned for June 11, 2018 will shut down the MOX Facility.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-53\">\n   Moreover, because the Federal Defendants' purported commitments and certifications set forth in the May 10 termination letter have legal consequences-namely leaving plutonium at SRS indefinitely and without the required environmental analysis under NEPA to determine the environmental consequences on the State and the potential alternatives-they consequently are reviewable by the court under the APA. \"For an action to be \"final\" under the APA, it should (1) mark the conclusion of the agency's decision-making process; and (2) be an action by which rights or obligations have been determined or from which legal consequences flow.\"\n   <em>\n    Bennett v.

Because the MOX Project is the only legally authorized disposition method for MOXable plutonium at SRS, the Federal Defendants' commitments and certifications not only terminate the MOX Project, but also leave no legally approved or funded pathway for disposition.

Governor McMaster notes that there were \"several communications\" in which he provided his \"concerns\" to the DOE about its \"direction of the MOX Project and proposed Dilute and Dispose approach.\" (ECF No. 5-2 \u00b6 6.) In August 2017, the DOE staff hosted a tour of the MOX Facility for the Governor and his senior policy advisor and provided briefings and discussions about the MOX Project. (ECF No. 19-9 \u00b6 4.) On January 31, 2018, Governor McMaster, Attorney General Wilson, and other high-ranking state officials visited DOE headquarters in Washington, DC and participated in a substantive meeting with high-ranking agency officials, in which they voiced their concerns about the possibility of the DOE using the Dilute and Dispose alternative option to remove plutonium from South Carolina instead of continuing with construction of the MOX Facility. (\n   <em>\n    Id.\n   </em>\n   at \u00b6 5.) In February and March of 2018, the Federal Defendants made efforts to schedule more meetings with the Governor to discuss the MOX Facility, but those meetings were not ultimately scheduled.

Here, by contrast, there were direct communications among high-level personnel from both the State, including\n   Governor McMaster himself, and the Federal Defendants, addressing the substance of the future of the DOE's efforts to remove plutonium from South Carolina. The State was not treated as another member of the public, but was in fact given direct access to visit the site itself, attending a meeting with high-level DOE officials at DOE headquarters, and having multiple communications directly with the Secretary himself. DOE has satisfied any plausible construction of the requirement to \"consult:\" the DOE communicated with, and listened to the views of the Governor prior to taking any formal action related to the disposition of surplus defense plutonium at SRS. The fact that the Federal Defendants ultimately disagreed with the Governor regarding the best course of action does not negate the fact that the Federal Defendants engaged in a meaningful exchange of information and views with Governor McMaster months prior to making any decision. Therefore, the State is not likely to succeed on the merits of its claim that the Secretary of Energy failed to consult with Governor McMaster prior to reaching his May 10, 2018 decisions.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-73\">\n   2.\n   <em>\n    Violation of NEPA-Failure to Prepare a Supplemental EIS for 50+ Years of Storage of Plutonium at SRS.\n   </em>\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-74\">\n   i.\n   <em>\n    NEPA\n   </em>\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-75\">\n   NEPA directs all federal agencies to assess the environmental impact of proposed actions that significantly affect the quality of the environment.\n   <extracted-citation index=\"68\" url=\"https://cite.case.law/citations/?q=42%20U.S.C.%20%C2%A7%204332\">\n    42 U.S.C.A. \u00a7 4332\n   </extracted-citation>\n   (2)(C).

United States\n   </em>\n   , 1:16-cv-00391-JMC (ECF No. 100 at 16). As the Federal Defendants advised the Fourth Circuit in their appeal of the court's Order to remove plutonium in accordance with the statute:\n  </p>\n  <blockquote id=\"p-82\">\n   \"Unfortunately, the same nuclear properties of plutonium that make it attractive to science also make this element hazardous to human beings.\" Many forms of plutonium can spontaneously ignite when exposed to air. In addition, plutonium's radioactivity requires \"a comprehensive safety program[ ]\" involving \"planning, personnel practices and engineered controls,\" as well as \"mass limitations, training, procedures, postings, personnel and area radiation monitoring, and emergency response.\"\n  </blockquote>\n  <p id=\"p-83\">\n   Br. of United States at 2, No. 18-1148 (4th Cir.

The PEIS analyzed and evaluated the storage of weapons-grade plutonium at SRS for a period of up to 50 years.\n   <em>\n    See\n   </em>\n   <em>\n    Hodges v. Abraham\n   </em>\n   ,\n   <extracted-citation case-ids=\"11420401\" index=\"82\" url=\"https://cite.case.law/f3d/300/432/#p444\">\n    300 F.3d 432\n   </extracted-citation>\n   , 447 (4th Cir. 2002) (\"By its 1996 PEIS, the DOE had examined various options for the long-term storage\n   of surplus plutonium ... at SRS for up to fifty years.\"). There have been supplements and updates since that time, but no evaluation or analysis has been undertaken that reviewed the storage at SRS of weapons-grade plutonium for a period longer than 50 years. The Federal Defendants posit that because DOE has thoroughly analyzed the potential environmental impacts of storing plutonium at SRS for up to 50 years, has not indicated it intends to exceed that storage period, and has not made any financial decision or commitment to the Dilute and Dispose approach, it is not required to produce a supplemental EIS in connection to its decision to terminate the MOX Project and pursue the Dilute and Dispose approach. (ECF No. 19 at 14.) However, as discussed below, the court finds that the May 10 decisions regarding the MOX Project are subject to NEPA and require a supplemental EIS.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-89\">\n   v.\n   <em>\n    No other disposal or removal alternative\n   </em>\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-90\">\n   The plutonium at SRS can be divided into two general categories-the plutonium intended for disposition through the MOX Facility and the plutonium not intended for MOX disposition. The ongoing Dilute and Dispose approach is limited in resources and legal authority and is not applicable to the plutonium intended for disposition through the MOX Facility.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-91\">\n   In fact, the Federal Defendants asked the National Academies of Science to \"evaluate the general viability of the DOE's plans for disposing of surplus plutonium in WIPP to support U.S. commitments under the Plutonium Management and Disposition Agreement, identify gaps, and recommend actions that could be taken by DOE and others to address those gaps.\"\n   <footnotemark>\n    22\n   </footnotemark>\n   That study is not anticipated to be completed until 2019. Moreover, the supplemental EIS that was performed resulting in the record of decision published on April 5, 2016 assigning Dilute and Dispose as the preferred alternative to dispose of the non-MOXable plutonium pursuant to NEPA specifically disclaimed reconsidering MOX as the disposition pathway for the MOXable 34 metric tons of plutonium.\n   <footnotemark>\n    23\n   </footnotemark>\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-92\">\n   When the U.S. Environmental Protection Agency (\"EPA\") was asked its opinion on utilizing Dilute and Dispose for the plutonium intended for MOX disposition, it pointed out the NEPA and environmental analysis that still had to be done. Specifically, the EPA stated:\n  </p>\n  <blockquote id=\"p-93\">\n   There would be many steps and some time before the EPA formally becomes involved in exercising its regulatory responsibilities associated with the possible disposal of the 34 MT of plutonium at the WIPP. This includes the NEPA activities that the DOE would be required to do.\n  </blockquote>\n  <p id=\"p-94\">\n   Compl. Ex. 28, Ltr. of EPA dated April 2, 2018. Importantly, the 2002 Report to Congress acknowledges that storage without a disposition \"would likely require additional NEPA review and public meetings.\" (ECF No. 1-7 at 4-26.) The Report further states that storage without disposition would be a \"significant departure from DOE's current decisions and commitments.\" (\n   <em>\n    Id.\n   </em>\n   at 4-27.)\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-95\">\n   In essence, the crux of the Federal Defendants' argument in regard to a NEPA violation is that the State should trust that by terminating the MOX Project, the Federal Defendants won't exceed the 50-year storage mark. However, the court declines to base its decision on the word of the Federal Government as its repeated actions in regard to the MOX Project have called into question the viability of such an outcome. Further, the court finds that pursuing the Dilute and Dispose approach would have a significant impact on the environment (as evidenced by the prior environmental impact statements issued by the Federal Defendants and by the NRC). Therefore, it is necessary that the Federal Defendants produce a supplemental EIS that addresses the conceivability, both practically and legally, of such a strategy. As such, the State will likely succeed on the merits of its claim that the May 10, 2018 decisions violated NEPA.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-96\">\n   3.\n   <em>\n    Violation of NDAA FY18 and CAA FY18-Failure to Meet Waiver Certification Requirements\n   </em>\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-97\">\n   The State is likely to succeed on its claim pursuant to the APA that the Secretary's May 10 commitment and certification that the requirements of Section 3121 of NDAA FY 18 and Section 309 of the CAA FY18 had been met is arbitrary and capricious because they have no basis in law or fact. Pursuant to NDAA FY18 \u00a7 3121(b)(1), in order to waive the expenditure restrictions, the Secretary must provide both a commitment to remove the plutonium from South Carolina and a certification of a less expensive alternative option. \u00a7 3121(b)(1).\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-98\">\n   i.\n   <em>\n    Commitment to Remove the Plutonium from South Carolina\n   </em>\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-99\">\n   The Federal Defendants argue that \"Congress did not set forth any specific level of proof that the Secretary must meet in order to satisfy any particular commitment requirement.\" (ECF No. 19 23-24.) The court declines to accept an argument that allows the Secretary to make commitments and certifications not supported by facts.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-100\">\n   In the May 10, 2018 decision, the Secretary of Energy provides, \"I confirm that the Department is committed to removing plutonium from South Carolina intended to be disposed of in the MOX facility[,]\" in an apparent attempt to satisfy Section 3121(b)(1)(A) of the NDAA FY18. The stated primary basis for this commitment is that \"[the Federal Defendants] are currently processing plutonium in South Carolina for shipment to the WIPP and intend to continue to do so.\" However, none of the defense plutonium that the Federal Defendants claim is currently being processed in South Carolina for shipment to WIPP was intended to be disposed of by the MOX Facility. Accordingly, this fact is irrelevant to and provides no support for the Secretary's commitment to remove plutonium from South Carolina that is intended to be disposed of in the MOX Facility, and thus, the Federal Defendants have relied on factors which Congress has not intended it to consider.\n   <em>\n    <extracted-citation case-ids=\"11420401\" index=\"83\" url=\"https://cite.case.law/f3d/300/432/#p444\">\n     Id.\n    </extracted-citation>\n   </em>\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-101\">\n   Further, the Secretary avers that the Federal Defendants' commitment to removal is supported by the fact that they are \"planning to install additional equipment for processing plutonium [pursuant to the Dilute and Dispose Approach] for removal from South Carolina and to increase the rate at which this removal can be carried out.\" The Secretary also states that the Federal Defendants \"are exploring whether any of the plutonium currently in South Carolina can be moved elsewhere for programmatic uses.\" Neither of\n   these statements presents evidence or support of a legitimate commitment to the removal of the plutonium intended to be disposed of in the MOX Facility. There has been no NEPA analysis of the Dilute and Dispose approach or the storage of an additional 34 metric tons of weapons-grade plutonium at WIPP, and the EPA has stated that the requisite NEPA analyses and other studies for the storage of the plutonium at WIPP will take \"many years.\"\n   <footnotemark>\n    24\n   </footnotemark>\n   Moreover, under applicable law and the Federal Defendants' permits for WIPP, the Federal Defendants are not currently permitted to store an additional 34 metric tons of weapons-grade plutonium at WIPP.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-102\">\n   The Federal Defendants are attempting to have it both ways. The basis for their \"commitment\" to remove plutonium and their basis for terminating the MOX Project is that they purportedly have an alternative for disposition and removal of the MOXable plutonium from South Carolina: \"Dilute and Dispose.\" But they also claim they did not have to conduct any NEPA analysis for the \"Dilute and Dispose\" approach yet because they have not made any final decision or commitment to the \"Dilute and Dispose\" approach (notwithstanding the May 10 decision letter). These two arguments are mutually exclusive. If, in fact, there has been no commitment to the \"Dilute and Dispose\" approach because it is still in the conceptual phase, then there is no basis for the Secretary's purported commitment to the removal of the plutonium from South Carolina. If, however, the Federal Defendants have made a decision to move forward with the \"Dilute and Dispose\" approach, then it is subject to challenge as a final agency action and would fail on the merits because no NEPA analysis has been conducted. Either way, the Secretary's commitment is invalid.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-103\">\n   ii.\n   <em>\n    Certification of a Less Expensive Alternative Option\n   </em>\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-104\">\n   The Federal Defendants' estimates used for the lifecycle costs of the MOX Project and the Dilute and Dispose approach are not of comparable accuracy pursuant to the certification requirement under Section 3121(b)(2) of the NDAA FY18. Section 3121(b)(1)(B)(ii) requires the lifecycle cost for the alternative to be conducted according to GAO best practices, and Section (b)(2) requires that the MOX estimate be of comparable accuracy. The estimated lifecycle cost completed in September 2016 for the MOX Project to which the Federal Defendants compared to the Dilute and Dispose lifecycle cost estimate was not determined in a manner comparable to GAO best practices, as GAO determined a few months ago and the Federal Defendants admit.\n   <footnotemark>\n    25\n   </footnotemark>\n   Accordingly, GAO reported:\n  </p>\n  <blockquote id=\"p-105\">\n   In our February 2014 report, we recommended that NNSA revise and update the Plutonium Disposition Program's life-cycle cost estimate using the MOX approach following our cost estimating best practices, such as conducting an independent cost estimate. NNSA generally agreed with our recommendation,\n   but has not yet implemented it ... Based on the findings of our review of NNSA's revised life-cycle cost estimate, we continue to believe that our recommendation remains valid.\n   <footnotemark>\n    26\n   </footnotemark>\n  </blockquote>\n  <p id=\"p-106\">\n   The Federal Defendants argue that they adjusted the 2016 MOX Project lifecycle cost estimate to make it of comparable accuracy to the Dilute and Dispose approach, which was conducted according to GAO best practices. (ECF No. 19-20 at \u00b6 6-7.) However, the court finds this estimate is unlikely to fulfil the comparable accuracy requirement of Section (b)(2). In short, the State is likely to demonstrate that a certification that the lifecycle cost estimates for the Dilute and Dispose approach and the MOX Project are of comparable accuracy cannot be made until a new estimate of the MOX approach following GAO best practices and using similar or comparable underlying assumptions to those used in the Dilute and Dispose approach is prepared. Therefore, the Secretary's certification that the lifecycle estimates are of comparable accuracy is unsupported by the \"relevant data\" and does not meet the requirements of Section 3121(b)(2) of the NDAA FY18.\n   <em>\n    Motor Vehicle Mfrs.,\n   </em>\n   <extracted-citation case-ids=\"6190630\" index=\"84\" url=\"https://cite.case.law/us/463/29/#p43\">\n    463 U.S. at 43\n   </extracted-citation>\n   ,\n   <extracted-citation case-ids=\"6190630\" index=\"85\" url=\"https://cite.case.law/us/463/29/#p43\">\n    103 S.Ct. 2856\n   </extracted-citation>\n   .\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-107\">\n   iii.\n   <em>\n    Statutory or Regulatory Changes\n   </em>\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-108\">\n   Section 3121(b)(1)(C) of the NDAA FY18 requires the Secretary to report to Congress \"the details of any statutory or regulatory changes necessary to complete the alternative option.\" The Secretary's letter did not provide any details of the statutory or regulatory changes that are necessary to complete the proposed Dilute and Dispose approach, and thus, the requirement has not been meet. First, although recognizing the \"capacity issues related to the receipt of the full 34 metric tons at WIPP,\" the Secretary states that all that is needed to proceed with the Dilute and Dispose approach is a proposed permit modification. However, DOE and NNSA have no basis in law or fact to simply assume that any permit modification will be granted. In fact, just this past Friday-June 1, 2018-the New Mexico Environment Department rejected the Federal Defendants' attempt to fast-track their permit modification request and is now requiring a more extensive review of the request because of the \"significant public concern and complex nature of the proposed change.\" (ECF No. 21-2.) The Federal Defendants cannot use this assumption to avoid the necessary reporting to Congress. In 2014, DOE issued a report finding that \"[d]isposal of the entire 34 MT of material in WIPP would require amendment of the WIPP Land Withdrawal Act. As with any location considered for this disposal mission, significant engagement with federal, state, and local representatives would be required. Implementing such an option would require Congressional action.\" (ECF No. 21-1.)\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-109\">\n   The second statute that would need to be modified for the Federal Defendants to proceed with the Dilute and Dispose approach and that the Federal Defendants did not disclose to Congress is Section 2566. This statute would need to be amended because it requires removal by January 1, 2022 of all the defense plutonium moved to South Carolina as of April 15, 2002. Under the Federal Defendants' Dilute and Dispose approach, they would not, according to their own estimates, be able to remove even one metric ton of plutonium from South Carolina until at least 2025, and they would also plan to import over 26 metric tons of plutonium into the State. The Federal Defendants therefore cannot legally implement the Dilute and Dispose approach unless Section 2566 is modified.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-110\">\n   Because the Secretary's purported commitments and certifications have no basis in law or fact, the State is likely to succeed on its claim that the Federal Defendants' decision to terminate the MOX Facility is arbitrary and capricious in violation of NDAA FY18 and CAA FY18.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-111\">\n   <strong>\n    C. Irreparable Harm\n   </strong>\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-112\">\n   Without a preliminary injunction, the State will suffer irreparable harm. The Federal Defendants have already issued a Partial Stop Work Order to the construction contractor that halted any new contracts or new hires at SRS for the MOX Project.\n   <footnotemark>\n    27\n   </footnotemark>\n   The Federal Defendants intend to issue a full stop work order to begin the wind-down of the MOX Project and termination of employees at SRS related to the MOX Project on or about June 11, 2018, which is the first business day after the 30-day period following Secretary Perry's certification during which the Federal Defendants cannot use funds provided for the construction of the MOX Facility to eliminate the Project. CAA FY18, \u00a7 309(c)(2).\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-113\">\n   The Federal Defendants seem to couch the State's main argument of irreparable harm to be the injuries of the individual SRS employees and the economic loss to the State. However, the harm the State seems to claim is that the Full Stop Work Order would be the \"event horizon\" for the termination of the MOX Project. Once the labor force is lost, the MOX Project is likely discontinued without an alternate approved or authorized disposition strategy or any removal strategy for the weapons-grade plutonium stored at SRS that was intended to be processed at the MOX Facility.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-114\">\n   Moreover, the implementation of the Federal Defendants' May 10 decisions without the creation of a supplemental EIC in and of itself creates irreparable harm.

The Federal Defendants' argument advanced at the hearing that there is a scant possibility that the MOX Facility could be restarted or refunded at some unknown future date is unavailing. That claim is directly contradicted by the evidence submitted by the Federal Defendants as well as the practical effect of the Full Stop Work Order. In addition, given the demand for the experienced and skilled craftsman, the loss of the labor force will likely occur immediately-not the 60 days the Federal Defendants contend it would take because of the WARN Act \"notice\" requirements. (\n   <em>\n    See\n   </em>\n   ECF No. 21-3.) Therefore, the State will be the party to suffer the irreparable harm.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-116\">\n   <strong>\n    D. Balance of Equities\n   </strong>\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-117\">\n   The court agrees that the financial impact resulting from a preliminary injunction weighs in favor of the Federal Defendants.\n   <footnotemark>\n    28\n   </footnotemark>\n   The Federal Defendants maintain that the continuation of MOX construction involves taxpayer expenditures of approximately $1.2 million per day.\n   <footnotemark>\n    29\n   </footnotemark>\n   (ECF No. 19-1 at \u00b6 22.) The court acknowledges the significance of that proposed amount. However, the balance of equities still heavily favors the State. As discussed, the injunction the State seeks will simply preserve the status quo. Congress has instructed the Federal Defendants to continue construction of the MOX Facility this fiscal year and already appropriated funds for that specific purpose. Through Section 2566, Congress also has directed the Federal Defendants to pursue construction of the MOX Facility. The requested preliminary injunction only seeks to maintain that construction (and the associated labor force) until the court can make a determination as to the legality of the Federal Defendants' decision to terminate the Project.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-118\">\n   Importantly, Congress has not approved or authorized the Dilute and Dispose approach as a replacement for the MOX Project. Therefore, if the Federal Defendants' agency action is not enjoined, the Federal Defendants will leave the United States with no disposition pathway for 34 metric tons of weapons-grade plutonium, reversing and rendering pointless over 20 years of studies, decisions, efforts, and substantial monetary investments to develop the MOX Facility to complete the United States' disposition mission.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-119\">\n   In addition, the United States' foreign interests are not furthered by terminating the MOX Facility. One of the purposes of pursuing the MOX Project was to meet the United States' obligations pursuant to the Plutonium Management and Disposition Agreement (\"PMDA\") with Russia, whereby each country agreed to dispose of no less than 34 metric tons of weapons-grade plutonium.\n   <footnotemark>\n    30\n   </footnotemark>\n   As support of the statutory requirements set forth in Section 2566 for construction and operation of the MOX Facility, Congress specifically found:\n  </p>\n  <blockquote id=\"p-120\">\n   (1) In September 2000, the United States and the Russian Federation signed PMDA by which each agreed to dispose of 34 metric tons of weapons-grade plutonium.\n  </blockquote>\n  <blockquote id=\"p-121\">\n   (2) The agreement with Russia is a significant step toward safeguarding nuclear materials and preventing their diversion to rogue states and terrorists.\n  </blockquote>\n  <blockquote id=\"p-122\">\n   (3) The Department of Energy plans to dispose of 34 metric tons of weapons-grade plutonium in the United States before the end of 2019 by converting the plutonium to a mixed-oxide fuel to be used in commercial nuclear power reactors.\n  </blockquote>\n  <blockquote id=\"p-123\">\n   (4) The Department has formulated a plan for implementing the agreement with Russia through construction of a mixed-oxide fuel fabrication facility, the so-called MOX facility, and a pit disassembly and conversion facility at the Savannah River Site, Aiken, South Carolina.\n  </blockquote>\n  <p id=\"p-124\">\n   NDAA FY03, Pub.

In response to the State's challenge to the shipment of plutonium into the State in 2002, Linton F. Brooks, then-Deputy Administrator for Defense Nuclear Nonproliferation for DOE/NNSA, testified that any delay or uncertainty in the MOX Project could \"kill\" the PMDA.\n   <footnotemark>\n    31\n   </footnotemark>\n   He further testified that failure to comply with the PMDA \"would call into question the United States' commitment to other nonproliferation efforts and diminish our credibility in continuing to provide leadership on these issues internationally.\"\n   <footnotemark>\n    32\n   </footnotemark>\n   Therefore, because the MOX approach is the only method approved under the PMDA for plutonium disposition, the decision to terminate the MOX Facility does not further the United States' foreign policy interests. This exact position was previously taken by DOE when it stated:\n  </p>\n  <blockquote id=\"p-126\">\n   [the long-term storage option without disposition] does not achieve the U.S. plutonium disposition mission and it renounces the U.S.-Russian PMDA.... This option would represent a reversal of the U.S. position on disposition of surplus plutonium, be derided internationally, and be opposed by the states and the public.\n   <footnotemark>\n    33\n   </footnotemark>\n  </blockquote>\n  <p id=\"p-127\">\n   In other words, the Federal Defendants have previously recognized that the very path they now desire to take violates an international nonproliferation agreement with Russia.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-128\">\n   The past history between South Carolina and the Federal Defendants with respect to the MOX Facility and weapons-grade plutonium located in the State also demonstrates that equity favors the State. Beginning in the late 1990s, DOE and its officials made countless commitments to the State, which the State relied on in agreeing to accept the defense plutonium that DOE insisted it urgently needed to ship to South Carolina. In particular, DOE committed to ensuring that the State not become the \"dumping ground\" for plutonium and, thus, committed to building the MOX Facility and expeditiously removing plutonium from the State if the MOX Facility was not timely built for any reason.\n   <footnotemark>\n    34\n   </footnotemark>\n   These commitments were then codified in\n   federal law through Section 2566, with the additional commitment of monetary payments to the State if the defense plutonium moved to the State was not timely processed or removed from the State.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-129\">\n   Now, DOE is reneging on its promises made over the course of the last two decades. The MOX Facility has not been timely built, no defense plutonium intended for MOX disposition has been removed from the State, and no monetary payments have been made. Further, the Federal Defendants have contested their statutory obligations to remove the plutonium and make the monetary payments. Accordingly, the balance of equities or hardships related to the MOX Facility weighs heavily for the State.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-130\">\n   <strong>\n    E.

The only way the Federal Defendants could avoid this mandate was by meeting the commitment and certification requirements of those respective statutes. Implicit in those statutory requirements, however, is that the Secretary's commitments and certifications are made in good faith and are supported by fact and law. By this decision, decades of the United States' plutonium disposition policy is overturned and, as discussed above, the Federal Defendants will violate one of the country's international nonproliferation\n   agreements.
