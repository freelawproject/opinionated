At the court's request, the parties consulted with the objective of identifying the articles for which classification remains in dispute. Plaintiff filed a submission on June 26, 2014 identifying those articles.\n   <em>\n    See\n   </em>\n   Letter from Simon Gluck &amp; Kane LLP to Ct. at Sched. 1 (June 26, 2014), ECF No. 111-1.

Heading 9504, HTSUS applies to \"[a]rticles for arcade, table or parlor games\" and heading 9505, HTSUS, the heading advocated by plaintiff, has the article description \"[f]estive, carnival or other entertainment articles, including magic tricks and practical joke articles.\"\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-44\">\n   Whether or not they are described by the term \"toys,\" the court eliminates heading 9502 from consideration because, even if the Trolls are considered to be \"dolls,\" they are not \"dolls representing only human beings.\"\n   <em>\n    See\n   </em>\n   Heading 9502, HTSUS. Instead, they are intended to represent mythical, non-human creatures.\n   <footnotemark>\n    4\n   </footnotemark>\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-45\">\n   While some of the features of the Trolls resemble human features, Trolls are not of human proportions, and they have cartoon-like, exaggerated and distorted features, including a flattened head that is about one-third of the total size of the body, cartoon-like faces with oversized eyes, ears, and noses, hands with only four digits, and feet with only four toes. Some have non-human skin tones such as lime green.\n   <em>\n    See, e.g.\n   </em>\n   , Pl.'s Rev. Ex. 43 (Dec. 12, 2014), ECF No. 125 (catalog image of Frankenstein Troll). Attached to the head of each Troll are strands of fluffy artificial \"hair\" in any of various colors (including red, blue, green, and black) that extends upwards, nearly equaling the height of the Troll's body.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-46\">\n   Heading 9503, by using the term \"[o]ther toys,\" includes within its scope those toys that do not fall within the scope of headings 9501 and 9502, HTSUS.\n   <em>\n    See also\n   </em>\n   EN 95.03 (instructing that heading 95.03 covers \"all toys\" not included in headings 95.01 and 95.02). Heading 9503, HTSUS, therefore, encompasses the Trolls if they are described by the term \"toys.\"\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-47\">\n   Common dictionary definitions of the term \"toy\" typically refer to an article intended solely or primarily for amusement rather than practical use.\n   <em>\n    See\n   </em>\n   Webster's Third New International Dictionary 2419 (1986) (defining a \"toy\" as \"something designed for amusement or diversion rather than practical use\"); 18 The Oxford English Dictionary 329 (2d ed. 1989) (defining a \"toy\" as \"[a] material object for children or others to play with (often an imitation of some familiar object); a plaything; also something contrived for amusement rather than for practical use\");\n   <em>\n    see also\n   </em>\n   EN to Chapter 95 (\"This Chapter covers toys of all kinds whether designed for the amusement of children or adults.\").\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-48\">\n   That the Trolls are designed for amusement (either of children or adults) is amply demonstrated by the samples and illustrations of these articles. The cartoon-like faces and bodies create a whimsical and fanciful impression and the \"apparel\" in which the Trolls are clothed contribute further to a conclusion that these articles are intended to amuse. The plastic and fabric composition, like the humorous features, is typical of a toy rather than a decorative statuette or figurine. Based on the undisputed facts, plaintiff is unable to show that the Trolls are not \"toys\" within the scope of heading 9503, HTSUS (\"Other toys\").\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-49\">\n   Plaintiff argues that even if the Trolls are\n   <em>\n    prima facie\n   </em>\n   described by the terms of heading 9503, HTSUS, they also fall within the scope of heading 9505, HTSUS (\"Festive, carnival or other entertainment articles, including magic tricks and practical joke articles\") and that the latter heading should be preferred to heading 9503, HTSUS by application of the rule of relative specificity set forth in GRI 3(a), HTSUS. Pl.'s Mot. 17. The court must reject this argument. The terms of heading 9505, HTSUS cause the court to conclude that heading 9505, HTSUS, while including a certain class of goods (identified below) that may be considered to fall within some definitions of the word \"toy,\" was never intended to encompass doll-like toys representing\n   creatures, such as the Trolls at issue herein.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-50\">\n   The term \"[f]estive, carnival or other entertainment articles\" as used in heading 9505, HTSUS has been the subject of considerable litigation, but the term has not been construed by the courts to encompass toys generally or, specifically, a doll-like toy representing a non-human creature. Plaintiff grounds its argument that the Trolls are described by this heading term in the clothing items with which the Trolls are dressed, which have themes related to a holiday or other festive event or a celebration.\n   <em>\n    See\n   </em>\n   Pl.'s Mot. 13 (stating that \"[a]ll of the items bear motifs, symbols, and contain symbolic content, traditionally associated with particular festive occasions\"). But however dressed, these goods are still toys, i.e., they are designed to provide amusement.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-51\">\n   The intended meaning of the heading term \"festive, carnival or other entertainment articles\" is vague, and common dictionary definitions consulted by the court, which regard the term \"entertainment\" as a noun, offer little clarification of the meaning of the term when used as an adjective. While it can be suggested, as plaintiff's argument might be taken to connote, that toys are, by definition, \"entertainment articles,\" such a contention blurs the distinctions between the meanings of the terms \"amusement\" and \"entertainment.\" Moreover, absent an indication of clear legislative intent, the court is not convinced that Congress could have intended for heading 9505, HTSUS to include countless varieties of toys that offer \"entertainment\" in the form of \"amusement,\" thus overlapping the scopes of headings 9501, 9502, and 9503, HTSUS. The HTSUS, like the HS on which its nomenclature is based, is designed such that GRI 1 will be paramount, and in that sense GRI 1 can be expected to resolve most classification issues. Plaintiff has not convinced the court that Congress, by including heading 9505 in the HTSUS, intended to sweep into the scope of this heading any type of toy simply because it displays a design related to a festival or holiday.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-52\">\n   Here, due to the vagueness inherent in the heading term \"festive, carnival or other entertainment articles\" when considered in relation to goods such as the Trolls, resort to the Explanatory Notes for clarification is particularly warranted. The Explanatory Notes confirm the court's interpretation of the scope of heading 9505, HTSUS as it relates to the Trolls. EN 95.05 gives two separate lists of examples to illustrate the scope of the heading. The first list, (list \"A\"), is of four groups of products that are examples of \"[f]estive, carnival or other entertainment articles,\" with the guidance that these articles \"in view of their intended use are generally made of non-durable material.\" EN 95.05. Listed as examples are:\n  </p>\n  <blockquote id=\"p-53\">\n   (1) Decorations such as festoons, garlands, Chinese lanterns, etc., as well as various decorative articles made of paper, metal foil, glass fibre, etc., for Christmas trees (e.g., tinsel, stars, icicles), artificial snow, coloured balls, bells, lanterns, etc. Cake and other decorations (e.g., animals, flags) which are traditionally associated with a particular festival are also classified here.\n  </blockquote>\n  <blockquote id=\"p-54\">\n   (2) Articles traditionally used at Christmas festivities, e.g., artificial Christmas trees ... nativity scenes, Christmas crackers, Christmas stockings, imitation yule logs.\n  </blockquote>\n  <blockquote id=\"p-55\">\n   (3) Articles of fancy dress, e.g., masks, false ears and noses, wigs, false beards and moustaches ... and paper hats. However, the heading\n   <strong>\n    excludes\n   </strong>\n   fancy dress of textile materials, of\n   <strong>\n    Chapter 61\n   </strong>\n   or\n   <strong>\n    62\n   </strong>\n   .\n  </blockquote>\n  <blockquote id=\"p-56\">\n   (4) Throw-balls of paper or cotton-wool, paper streamers (carnival tape), cardboard trumpets, \"blow-outs\", confetti, carnival umbrellas, etc.\n  </blockquote>\n  <p id=\"p-57\">\n   EN 95.05 (emphasis in original). The examples in paragraphs (A)(1) and (A)(4), above, have in common their decorative character. The examples in (A)(2) serve to clarify that the heading includes a class of articles traditionally used at Christmas festivities (or, by implication, other holiday festivals), whether or not decorative in character. This is shown by the example of the traditional English Christmas crackers (or \"cracker bon bons,\" which when opened at both ends release party favors or candy), which might not be seen as \"decorative\" in an ordinary sense but can be considered \"festive\" due to their traditional association with the Christmas holiday. They are collections of articles, including edible ones, and it would not be correct to consider them toys (although they may contain small toys as well as candy and such). The example of Christmas stockings is to a class of articles that are decorative, festive, and functional, i.e., they are designed to hold small presents as well as serve as a home decoration during the Christmas season. Trolls are not analogous to a Christmas stocking (although they might be placed inside one). The example in (A)(3) of \"fancy dress\" articles (excluding textile apparel) sheds further light on the meaning of the term \"festive, carnival or other entertainment articles\" by including a class of goods made for use at certain special occasions, e.g., costume balls and masquerades. But none of the examples in the four groups listed in (A) is of goods that ordinarily would be considered \"toys.\"\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-58\">\n   The second list of examples in EN 95.05, (list \"B\"), is directed to the term in HS heading 95.05, \"including conjuring tricks and novelty jokes\" that modifies the term \"festive, carnival and other entertainment articles.\" EN 95.05 explains that the heading includes:\n  </p>\n  <blockquote id=\"p-59\">\n   <strong>\n    Conjuring tricks and novelty jokes,\n   </strong>\n   e.g., packs of cards, tables, screens and containers, specially designed for the performance of conjuring tricks; novelty jokes such as sneezing powder, surprise sweets, water-jet button-holes and \"Japanese flowers\".\n  </blockquote>\n  <p id=\"p-60\">\n   EN 95.05 (emphasis in original). These examples are of articles that are \"entertainment\" articles, but they illustrate distinctly different classes of goods than do the \"festive\" and decorative examples in list (A). Unlike the examples in list (A), some articles of a type exemplified by list (B) (which includes \"water-jet button-holes\") might be considered to be \"toys\" in the broad sense of the term. In this regard, it is noteworthy that Congress indicated that some goods that may be described as \"toys\" could fall within the scope of heading 9505, HTSUS when it temporarily suspended the duty on \"articles ... provided for in heading 9502, 9503, or 9504, or\n   <em>\n    subheading 9505.90\n   </em>\n   (except balloons, marbles, dice, and diecast vehicles), valued not over 5\u00a2 per unit.\" Subheading 9902.71.13, HTSUS (emphasis added). Subheading 9505.90 contains the following footnote (footnote 1) directing the reader to this temporary duty suspension: \"Duty on certain toys temporarily suspended. See subheading 9902.71.13.\" The note applies to subheading 9505.90, one of the two subheadings of heading 9505, HTSUS. That subheading applies to goods of the heading\n   <em>\n    other than\n   </em>\n   \"[a]rticles for Christmas festivities and parts and accessories thereof\" (subheading 9905.10, HTSUS).\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-61\">\n   The \"magic tricks and practical joke articles\" term in the article description for heading 9505, HTSUS is the U.S. expression of the international HS term \"including conjuring tricks and novelty jokes.\"\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-62\">\n   EN 95.05. By using the term \"including magic tricks and practical joke articles\" as a modifier of the general term \"festive, carnival or other entertainment articles,\" Congress indicated that the general term must be read to include two classes of goods, \"magic tricks\" and \"practical joke articles,\" that ordinarily might not be considered to fall within that term.\n   <em>\n    See\n   </em>\n   Norman J. Singer &amp; Shambie Singer, Statutes and Statutory Construction \u00a7 47.23 (7th ed. 2014) (Sutherland) (explaining that \"[t]he maxim\n   <em>\n    expressio unius est exclusio alterius\n   </em>\n   \" instructs that \"where a statute designates ... the persons and things to which it refers, courts should infer that all omissions were intentional exclusions\" (footnotes omitted) );\n   <em>\n    see also\n   </em>\n   <em>\n    DWA Holdings LLC v.

Cir. 2018) (\"[W]here Congress includes particular language in one section of a statute but omits it in another section of the same Act, it is generally presumed that Congress acts intentionally and purposely in the disparate inclusion or exclusion.\" (quoting\n   <em>\n    Brown v.

In this case, by including \"magic tricks and practical joke articles\" in heading 9505, HTSUS, articles that are not normally decorative or utilitarian, but that in some instances may be considered \"toys,\" Congress intended to treat entertainment articles described by the terms \"magic tricks and practical joke articles\" differently than the \"toys\" classified under headings 9501, 9502, and 9503, HTSUS. The term \"including magic tricks and practical joke articles\" connotes that only these two special classes of goods (some of which may be describable as toys), as opposed to toys generally, fall within the scope of heading 9505.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-63\">\n   In summary, the undisputed facts, and in particular the samples, demonstrate that the Trolls, which have the amusing physical characteristics of toys, are not decorations or ornaments. Whether or not they are dressed in outfits with Christmas-related themes, they cannot truthfully be described as articles \"traditionally used at Christmas festivities,\" as are artificial Christmas trees, nativity scenes, Christmas crackers, Christmas stockings, or imitation yule logs. They have the physical composition (plastic and fabric) and appearance of doll-like toys rather than the decorative characteristics of Christmas ornaments or Christmas tree ornaments. And while they are toys that provide \"amusement,\" the Trolls are not within the class of \"entertainment\" articles that have the characteristics of magic tricks, novelty, or practical joke articles. Because of the terms of heading 9505, HTSUS, and because of the common characteristics of the classes and kinds of articles the drafters intended heading 95.05 to cover, as shown by the examples in EN 95.05, classifying the Trolls under heading 9505, HTSUS impermissibly would expand the scope of the heading to encompass a class of goods, i.e., doll-like toys, that do not share any of the common characteristics of the goods of that heading.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-64\">\n   Plaintiff advances various arguments in an attempt to show that heading 9505, HTSUS includes within its scope the Trolls that are at issue in this case. For the reasons discussed below, the court does not find merit in these arguments.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-65\">\n   Citing various decisions of this Court and the Court of Appeals for the Federal Circuit (\"Court of Appeals\"), plaintiff argues, first, that classification of the Trolls under heading 9505, HTSUS, is required by case law. Pl.'s Mot. 10-15. Plaintiff asserts that \"[t]he Trolls were manufactured and imported together attired in clothing bearing symbols associated with several holidays, including Christmas, Thanksgiving, Halloween, Easter, St. Patrick's Day, and Valentine's Day, as well as private festive occasions such as Bat Mitzvahs,\n   Birthdays, and Weddings.\"\n   <em>\n    Id.\n   </em>\n   at 9. Plaintiff relies on\n   <em>\n    Midwest of Cannon Falls, Inc. v. United States\n   </em>\n   ,\n   <extracted-citation case-ids=\"302485\" index=\"25\" url=\"https://cite.case.law/f3d/122/1423/\">\n    122 F.3d 1423\n   </extracted-citation>\n   (Fed. Cir. 1997), as well as various cases interpreting that decision, for the proposition that the Trolls must be classified under heading 9505, HTSUS because of close association with a festive occasion and use or display principally during that festive occasion.\n   <em>\n    Id.\n   </em>\n   at 12. Plaintiff also argues that heading 9505, HTSUS, which it characterizes as a provision controlled by use within the scope of Additional U.S. Rule of Interpretation 1(a), HTSUS, is to be preferred by application of GRI 3(a), HTSUS. Pl.'s Mot. 17-20. It argues that such is the case whether the court considers heading 9503, HTSUS to be an\n   <em>\n    eo nomine\n   </em>\n   provision or a provision controlled by use.\n   <em>\n    Id.\n   </em>\n   at 20. The court is not persuaded by these arguments.\n   <em>\n    Midwest of Cannon Falls\n   </em>\n   did not involve the classification of any article similar to Trolls. That case involved the classification of 27 articles, 23 of which were found to be Christmas ornaments and classified accordingly under heading 9505, HTSUS.\n   <em>\n    Midwest of Cannon Falls\n   </em>\n   ,\n   <extracted-citation case-ids=\"302485\" index=\"26\" url=\"https://cite.case.law/f3d/122/1423/\">\n    122 F.3d at 1429\n   </extracted-citation>\n   . Of the 23 Christmas ornaments, only two-a \"[w]ooden pull toy (ice skater)\" and a \"[t]oy smoker (Santa)\"-were described as \"toys\" in the opinion. Both of these articles, however, were found to be Christmas ornaments and determined for tariff classification purposes to be \"Christmas ornaments of wood\" classified under subheading 9505.10.15, HTSUS.\n   <em>\n    <extracted-citation case-ids=\"302485\" index=\"27\" url=\"https://cite.case.law/f3d/122/1423/\">\n     Id.\n    </extracted-citation>\n   </em>\n   The court finds nothing in the samples or illustrations of the Trolls that causes the court to conclude that any of the Trolls are Christmas ornaments. The other four articles at issue in\n   <em>\n    Midwest of Cannon Falls\n   </em>\n   were described by the Court of Appeals as a \"[h]eart-shaped metal wreath,\" a \"[j]ack-o'-lantern earthenware mug,\" a \"[j]ack-o'-lantern earthenware pitcher,\" and an \"Easter water globe.\"\n   <em>\n    <extracted-citation case-ids=\"302485\" index=\"28\" url=\"https://cite.case.law/f3d/122/1423/\">\n     Id.\n    </extracted-citation>\n   </em>\n   The Court of Appeals determined that these four articles were \"Other festive articles\" classifiable under heading 9505, HTSUS.\n   <em>\n    <extracted-citation case-ids=\"302485\" index=\"29\" url=\"https://cite.case.law/f3d/122/1423/\">\n     Id.\n    </extracted-citation>\n   </em>\n   These articles are each dissimilar to Trolls: the pitcher and mug are tableware, and the wreath and globe are decorative articles. In summary,\n   <em>\n    Midwest of Cannon Falls\n   </em>\n   does not hold that doll-like toys such as the Trolls will be classified under heading 9505, HTSUS as \"festive ... or other entertainment articles\" simply because they are outfitted in holiday or festive garb.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-66\">\n   Plaintiff argues, further, that \"[t]o the extent that the question at issue in this discussion concerns the consideration of two competing tariff provisions, each lacking defining or limiting legal notes,\n   <em>\n    Midwest [of Cannon Falls]\n   </em>\n   and the\n   <em>\n    Russ Berrie Festive Jewelry Case\n   </em>\n   are the most relevant cases among those involving the proper classification of 'festive articles.' \" Pl.'s Mot. 12.

Each of those cases involved the question of whether an article with a utilitarian function (including an \"apparel\" or \"jewelry\" function) also could be a \"festive, carnival or other entertainment article[ ]\" within the scope of heading 9505, HTSUS due to a \"festive\" or \"holiday\" decorative characteristic. That question is not presented by the Trolls, which have no utilitarian function and are toys, not decorations. Plaintiff is incorrect in advocating that these decisions of the Court of Appeals are controlling on the issue of classification of the Trolls.\n   <footnotemark>\n    5\n   </footnotemark>\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-70\">\n   The court is not convinced by plaintiff's argument that the Trolls are \"festive, carnival or other entertainment articles\" within the meaning of the heading term due to the way they are dressed, i.e., in garb associated with holidays or festivals.\n   <em>\n    See\n   </em>\n   Pl.'s Mot. 13. The clothing and accessories of the Trolls do not change the doll-like or toy-like character of this merchandise and instead may be observed to\n   <em>\n    contribute to\n   </em>\n   the amusing qualities. Explanatory Note 95.02 is instructive in providing that dolls of HS heading 95.02 may be \"dressed.\" Under plaintiff's logic, it could be contended that a doll representing a human being outfitted in a dress with a holiday theme would be\n   <em>\n    prima facie\n   </em>\n   classifiable under heading 9505, HTSUS even though that heading was not intended to encompass dolls or toys generally. Such a contention would be contrary to the organization of chapter 95, HTSUS and the guidance provided in ENs 95.02, 95.03, and 95.05. As the court has explained, the headings of chapter 95, HTSUS are organized such that the toys of headings 9501 through 9503, HTSUS are distinguishable from the goods that are classified in heading 9505, HTSUS. The latter includes magic tricks and practical joke articles, but it would be error to construe the heading to include other classes or kinds of toys, such as the Trolls.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-71\">\n   In conclusion, the Trolls at issue in this case are not described by the terms of heading 9505, HTSUS, when those terms are properly construed. The Trolls instead answer to a descriptive term of heading 9503, HTSUS (\"Other toys\"). The parties identify no other candidate headings, and the court finds none. Because no heading other than heading 9503, HTSUS contains a term describing the Trolls, the court resolves the question of the correct heading according to GRI 1, HTSUS and therefore does not reach an issue of relative specificity that would call for the application of GRI 3(a), HTSUS. Therefore, the Trolls are properly classified under heading 9503, HTSUS.\n   <footnotemark>\n    6\n   </footnotemark>\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-72\">\n   The correct subheading for the Trolls is subheading 9503.49.00, HTSUS (\"Other toys ...: Toys representing animals or non-human creatures ...: Other\"), subject to duty at 6.8%\n   <em>\n    ad val.\n   </em>\n   , with the exception of one Troll, identified as Style No. 2385, \"Soft Body Troll in Candy Cane Print Pajamas.\" This Troll, a sample of which plaintiff provided in its separate submission, differs from the other Trolls at issue in having a fabric-covered body stuffed with a soft material; only the face of the article is of plastic.\n   <em>\n    See\n   </em>\n   Notice of Manual Filing at Ex. 1 (submitting physical sample to court). Because this model of Troll is a stuffed toy, the correct subheading is 9503.41.10, HTSUS (\"Other toys ...: Toys representing animals or non-human creatures ...: Stuffed toys\"), temporarily free of duty according to subheading 9902.95.02, HTSUS (\"Stuffed or filled toys representing animals or nonhuman creatures, not having a spring mechanism and not exceeding 63.5 cm in either length, width, or height (provided for in subheading 9503.41.10 or 9503.49.00)\").\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-73\">\n   <em>\n    2.

Goonie Goblins are\n   <em>\n    prima facie\n   </em>\n   classifiable under heading 9503, HTSUS.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-80\">\n   Plaintiff claims classification under heading 9505, HTSUS (\"Festive ... or other entertainment articles\"). Pl.'s Mot. 20-29. The court rejects this claim because the Goonie Goblins are not described by the terms of heading 9505, HTSUS as properly interpreted. They are toys, not decorations. The connection with Halloween is only that the toys have Halloween-related themes, and in that respect these goods cannot truthfully be described as a traditional article of celebration or festivity. While intended for amusement, they do not belong to the class or kind of \"magic tricks\" or \"practical joke articles\" encompassed by heading 9505, HTSUS.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-81\">\n   The court, therefore, concludes that the Goonie Goblins are classified under heading 9503, HTSUS (\"Other toys ...\"). The applicable subheading is 9503.49.00, HTSUS (\"Other toys ...: Toys representing animals or non-human creatures (for example, robots and monsters) ...: Other\"), subject to duty at 6.8%\n   <em>\n    ad val.\n   </em>\n   The court determines classification in this subheading rather than the more general one under which the Goonie Goblins were classified upon liquidation, subheading 9503.90.60, HTSUS (\"Other toys ...: Other: Other toys (except models), not having a spring mechanism\"), also subject to duty at 6.8%\n   <em>\n    ad val.\n   </em>\n   This was incorrect in ignoring the defining characteristic of the merchandise, which is as toys representing non-human creatures.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-82\">\n   <em>\n    3.

Tariff Classification of the Haunting Horrors\n   </em>\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-89\">\n   The court eliminates heading 9505, HTSUS from consideration because the Haunting Horrors, like the Trolls and the Goonie Goblins finger puppets, are\n   toys of a type that do not fall within the scope of that heading. Simply stated, they are plastic articles that have the characteristics of toys, not the characteristics of decorative figurines or of any other of the classes of \"festive, carnival or other entertainment articles\" that fall within the scope of heading 9505, HTSUS. The holographic \"skull\" feature, as are the other grotesque physical features, are characteristic of articles of amusement rather than of the types of goods that heading 9505, HTSUS was intended to encompass.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-90\">\n   The court also eliminates heading 9502, HTSUS (\"Dolls representing only human beings ...\") from consideration because these figures are not \"dolls\" representing human beings. Although the witch and grim reaper have some human-like characteristics, the Haunting Horrors represent imaginary creatures with grotesque features.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-91\">\n   In summary, the court agrees with defendant that classification under heading 9503, HTSUS is correct. Because the Haunting Horrors are toys representing non-human creatures, the correct subheading is 9503.49.00, HTSUS (\"Other toys ...: Toys representing animals or non-human creatures ...: Other\"), subject to duty at 6.8%\n   <em>\n    ad val.\n   </em>\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-92\">\n   <em>\n    4.

As shown in the catalog illustration,\n   <em>\n    see\n   </em>\n   Pl.'s Rev. Ex. 43, they are not dolls and in any event depict partial skeletons, not live or complete human beings, so the court may eliminate heading 9502, HTSUS (\"Dolls representing only human beings ...\") from consideration. Heading 9503, HTSUS (\"Other toys ...\"), which is intended to encompass toys not classified in headings 9501 and 9502, HTSUS contains a term describing these push puppets.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-99\">\n   Plaintiff maintains that heading 9505, HTSUS is the more appropriate heading in which to classify the goods because, even if the Bobbling Bones are\n   <em>\n    prima facie\n   </em>\n   classifiable in heading 9503, HTSUS, the goods must be classified according to their principal use, which plaintiff contends is as a \"festive article.\" Pl.'s Reply 24-28. The court is not persuaded by this argument. The Bobbling Bones are not decorative articles, nor do they have the characteristics of the other types of festive or other entertainment articles encompassed by heading 9505, HTSUS. The association of the Bobbling Bones with Halloween is the depiction of a tombstone, a part of a skeleton, and a Halloween-themed saying, but this association is the source of the amusing characteristic of these articles as Halloween-themed toys. As the court has discussed, heading 9505, HTSUS is not so broad as to encompass any kind of a toy simply because it has the theme of a holiday or festive occasion.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-100\">\n   The Bobbling Bones have amusing characteristics, but they lack the characteristics of the magic tricks, practical joke articles and similar novelty items that find classification within heading 9505, HTSUS. The \"bobbling\" feature is an amusing feature, not a \"magic trick\" or \"practical joke\" feature.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-101\">\n   As to the correct subheading, the court concludes that the subheadings applicable to \"[t]oys representing animals or non-human creatures\" does not describe the whole article, which consists of a tombstone as well as a partial skeleton. The subheading under which the article was liquidated, 9503.90.60, HTSUS (\"Other toys ...: Other: Other toys (except models), not having a spring mechanism\"), is also incorrect. The court so concludes because these goods are \"push puppets\" that require a spring mechanism in the base for their operation (as does \"Lazy Bones\"). Therefore, by operation of GRI 6, HTSUS the correct subheading is 9503.90.70, HTSUS (\"Other toys ...: Other: Other\").

As the court discusses below, one article in the Fun Center, the paint palette, if classified separately, would be classified under heading 3213, HTSUS (\"Artists', students' or signboard painters' colors, ... amusement colors and the like, in tablets ... or in similar forms or packings\") and not under heading 9503, HTSUS.\n   <em>\n    See\n   </em>\n   EN 95.03 (instructing that HS heading 95.03 excludes \"[p]aints put up for children's use (\n   <strong>\n    heading 32.13\n   </strong>\n   ) ). Another group in the collection (the Squirt Balls) is classified under heading 9505, HTSUS. Goods classifiable under different headings are classified in a single heading according to essential character, by operation of GRI 3(b), HTSUS if they are \"put up in sets for\n   retail sale.\" To constitute a set put up for retail sale, the goods must be packaged together for retail sale and also must be put up together to meet a particular need or carry out a specific activity.\n   <em>\n    See\n   </em>\n   EN X(b) to General Interpretive Rule (\"GIR\") 3(b).

Even were it assumed that it is a retail package, the collection still would not qualify as being \"put up in sets for retail sale\" because the individual items have separate uses and in that respect cannot be said to be packaged together to meet a particular need or carry out a specific activity for purposes of GRI 3(b), HTSUS. From the examples given in Explanatory Note X to GIR 3(b), the individual\n   <em>\n    articles\n   </em>\n   must meet a particular need or carry out a specific activity; it is therefore insufficient for purposes of GRI 3(b), HTSUS that they are suitable for handing out as Halloween gifts. EN X to GIR 3(b) gives as an example of a collection that is \"put up in sets for retail sale\" goods comprising the components of a spaghetti meal (uncooked spaghetti, grated cheese, and sauce) and gives as an example of a collection that does\n   <em>\n    not\n   </em>\n   qualify as a set put up for retail sale a retail package consisting of different, unrelated food or beverage items packaged together.

It is well established that the term \"festive ... or other entertainment articles\" as used in heading 9505, HTSUS may include decorative items associated with a particular holiday or festival, and the fact that an article also has a utilitarian function did not by itself exclude an article from the heading at the time these goods were entered.\n   <footnotemark>\n    11\n   </footnotemark>\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-158\">\n   GRI 1 requires the court to consider, in addition to the terms of the headings, \"any relative section or chapter notes.\" GRI 1, HTSUS. Two chapter notes of the HTSUS are particularly instructive as to the question of which of the two headings is correct for the candleholders. Note 1(a)-(\n   <em>\n    l\n   </em>\n   ) to\n   chapter 94, HTSUS is a list of exclusions from chapter 94. One of the exclusions, note 1(\n   <em>\n    l\n   </em>\n   ), excludes from chapter 94, HTSUS,\n   <em>\n    inter alia\n   </em>\n   , \"decorations (other than electric garlands) such as Chinese lanterns (heading 9505).\" A related exclusion from chapter 95, HTSUS is contained in note 1(t) to chapter 95, which excludes from that chapter \"[e]lectric garlands of all kinds (heading 9405).\"\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-159\">\n   Read together, the two exclusions instruct that some \"lamps\" that are also \"decorations\" fall within the scope of heading 9405, HTSUS while others fall within the scope of heading 9505, HTSUS. \"Electric garlands\" is a term the court did not find in common dictionaries, but the intended meaning of the term as used in the two related chapter notes is revealed by the Explanatory Note to heading 94.05, which provides as guidance that heading 94.05 \"covers in particular ... electric garlands (including those fitted with fancy lamps for carnival or entertainment purposes or for decorating Christmas trees).\" EN 94.05. Thus, according to the chapter notes, garlands, which are decorations, and electric garlands, which typically are decorations and also are lamps, are classified in heading 9405, HTSUS and excluded from heading 9505, HTSUS. For example, a string of decorative electric lights (suitable, for example, as Christmas or Halloween decorations) would be classified under heading 94.05 and not under heading 95.05, despite the decorative \"holiday\" or \"festive\" characteristic.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-160\">\n   The court finds it significant that note 1(\n   <em>\n    l\n   </em>\n   ) to chapter 94 does not exclude from chapter 94\n   <em>\n    all\n   </em>\n   lamps that are decorations but instead excludes \"decorations ...\n   <em>\n    such as\n   </em>\n   Chinese lanterns (heading 9505).\" The court, therefore, must discern the class of illuminating decorations of which Chinese lanterns are an example. Neither the HTSUS nor the Explanatory Notes define the term \"Chinese lantern,\" but dictionary definitions are instructive.\n   <em>\n    See\n   </em>\n   Webster's Third New International Dictionary 390 (1986) (defining a \"Chinese lantern\" as \"a collapsible lantern of thin colored paper mostly for ceremonial or decorative use\"); 3 The Oxford English Dictionary 128 (2d ed. 1989) (defining a \"Chinese-lantern\" as \"a collapsable lantern of thin coloured paper, chiefly used in illuminations\"). Under these definitions, a Chinese lantern must be considered to fall within the common meaning of the term \"lamp.\"\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-161\">\n   The question presented, then, is which holiday-themed or festive illuminating decorations fall within heading 9405, HTSUS and which fall within heading 9505, HTSUS; as the court has noted, an article cannot fall within both. While clearly lamps, it is less clear that the candleholders at issue fall within the intended meaning of the term \"festive ... or other entertainment articles,\" a term that has engendered considerable tariff litigation. Plaintiff relies on several appellate decisions in support of its classification position that they do,\n   <em>\n    see\n   </em>\n   Pl.'s Mot. 26-29, but none of these decisions is controlling on the narrow question presented, which involves only decorative, holiday-themed porcelain or earthenware candleholders. In addition to the indications the court gleans from note 1(\n   <em>\n    l\n   </em>\n   ) to chapter 94 and note 1(t) to chapter 95, EN 95.05 provides helpful guidance in stating that heading 95.05 \"covers ...\n   <strong>\n    Festive, carnival or other entertainment articles,\n   </strong>\n   which in view of their intended use are generally made of non-durable material.\" EN 95.05(A). Within the limitation that they are generally made of non-durable material, the EN lists various examples of decorations that fall within heading 95.05, some of which are lamps:\n  </p>\n  <blockquote id=\"p-162\">\n   Decorations such as festoons, garlands,\n   <em>\n    Chinese lanterns\n   </em>\n   , etc., as well as various decorative articles made of paper, metal foil, glass fibre, etc., for Christmas trees\n   (e.g., tinsel, stars, icicles), artificial snow, coloured balls, bells,\n   <em>\n    lanterns\n   </em>\n   , etc. Cake and other decorations (e.g., animals, flags) which are traditionally associated with a particular festival are also classified here.\n  </blockquote>\n  <p id=\"p-163\">\n   EN 95.05(A)(1) (emphasis added). Chinese lanterns serve as examples of non-durable illuminating decorations, being typically constructed of paper. Other examples of articles falling within heading 95.05, as provided by EN 95.05, and also within the limitation that they are generally made of non-durable material, are \"[a]rticles traditionally used at Christmas festivities, e.g., artificial Christmas trees (these are sometimes of the folding type), nativity scenes, Christmas crackers, Christmas stockings, imitation yule logs.\" EN 95.05(A)(2).\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-164\">\n   The court notes, further, that candleholders are expressly identified in EN 94.05 as a class or kind of goods within the scope of heading 94.05. In comparison, EN 95.05 does not make specific mention of candleholders even though specifically identifying (as do the relevant HTSUS chapter notes) a class of non-durable decorative lamps, i.e., Chinese lanterns, as falling within the scope of heading 95.05.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-165\">\n   Note 1(\n   <em>\n    l\n   </em>\n   ) to chapter 9405, HTSUS and note 1(t) to chapter 9505, HTSUS when read together and also interpreted consistently with the guidance provided in the Explanatory Notes, indicate a general principle under which certain illuminating decorations associated with festive or holiday occasions fall within heading 9505, HTSUS, but these, as a general matter, are constructed of non-durable material. In summary, the different treatment accorded to electric garlands and to Chinese lanterns by the relevant chapter notes, the placement of \"decorations ... such as Chinese lanterns,\" but not\n   <em>\n    all\n   </em>\n   illuminating decorations (whether or not holiday-or festival-themed) within heading 9505, HTSUS, the mention of candleholders in EN 94.05 and the absence of a similar mention in EN 95.05, and the clarification in EN 95.05 that identifies the criterion of durability of construction as relevant to classification, are consistent in indicating an intended division between the two headings when applied to the particular situation posed by festive or holiday-themed decorations with an illuminating function. In summary, the HTSUS embodies a general principle that goods that are holiday-themed decorations but also are lamps, if of a non-durable construction, fall within the scope of heading 9505, HTSUS, while such decorations of more durable construction (such as the candleholders at issue in this case) generally do not and remain classified under heading 9405, HTSUS.\n   <footnotemark>\n    12\n   </footnotemark>\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-166\">\n   There can be no genuine dispute that the candleholders at issue, being either porcelain or earthenware, are made of durable material, befitting the candle-holding function for which they are designed. The court concludes that by operation of GRI 1, HTSUS, in full consideration of the terms of the competing headings and the relative chapter notes, the candleholders at issue are properly classified under heading 9405, HTSUS. The correct subheading, as\n   defendant maintains, is subheading 9405.50.40, HTSUS (\"Lamps and lighting fittings ... not elsewhere specified or included ...: Non-electrical lamps and lighting fittings: Other: Other\"), subject to duty at 7.6%\n   <em>\n    ad val.\n   </em>\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-167\">\n   <em>\n    8.

These headings do not describe the entire article but only a part thereof. As the sample shows, the Etched Images Plaque is assembled from seven components, only one of which is plastic. Notice of Manual Filing at Ex. 2. The two-piece threaded stand assembly and the gold frame, which is of four pieces, are of metal.\n   <em>\n    Id.\n   </em>\n   These are not insignificant components. The gold frame is integral to the decorative aspect of the article, harmonizing with the gold-metallic-toned\n   etched image of the chalice. The two-piece threaded metal stand, also gold-toned, allows the item to function as a decorative article that is designed to be displayed on a horizontal surface.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-173\">\n   Unlike the other candidate headings, which do not describe the whole article, heading 9505, HTSUS contains a term, \"festive ... articles,\" that describes the Etched Images Plaque in the entirety. The heading contains within its scope certain decorations that are associated with particular holidays or festivals. The sample demonstrates, beyond any genuine issue of material fact, that the Etched Images Plaque is an Easter decoration. The Easter Lilies, the gold chalice (depicting the Holy Chalice of the Last Supper), and the message referencing the resurrection of Jesus Christ are symbolic of the Easter holiday. Classification under heading 9505, HTSUS is, therefore, correct.\n   <em>\n    See, e.g.\n   </em>\n   ,\n   <em>\n    Midwest of Cannon Falls\n   </em>\n   ,\n   <extracted-citation case-ids=\"302485\" index=\"53\" url=\"https://cite.case.law/f3d/122/1423/\">\n    122 F.3d at 1429\n   </extracted-citation>\n   (classifying under heading 9505, HTSUS an Easter water globe).\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-174\">\n   Defendant argues that the article \"fails the criteria for 'festive article' developed by the United States Court of Appeals for the Federal Circuit ... in the\n   <em>\n    Midwest\n   </em>\n   ,\n   <em>\n    Park\n   </em>\n   , and\n   <em>\n    Michael Simon\n   </em>\n   cases because it is not so tied to a festive occasion that it would be aberrant to use the plaque year-round.\" Def.'s Mot. 4-5 (footnote omitted). The court disagrees with this logic. The cited cases did not involve merchandise analogous to the Etched Images Plaque and raised different considerations. Moreover, defendant's argument disregards the readily apparent symbolism of the Easter Lilies and the gold chalice. It also disregards the wording of the inscribed message, which pertains to Easter.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-175\">\n   In summary, heading 9505, HTSUS is the correct heading for classification of the Etched Images Plaque by operation of GRI 1, HTSUS.

Notice of Manual Filing at Exs. 6-8. They are not in the same styles as the Baby Booties that were imported on the entries at issue in this case (samples of which are no longer available), but they appear to be of the same construction as the Baby Booties at issue, according to illustrations in plaintiff's catalogs. The court bases its classification decision on the catalog illustrations and the samples.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-186\">\n   Footwear, as a general matter, is classified within section XII of the HTSUS, in chapter 64 (\"Footwear, gaiters and the like; parts of such articles\"). Footwear of textile material without applied soles are an exception to this general principle and are classified within section XI (\"Textile and textile articles\"). Note 1(a) to Chapter 64, HTSUS (excluding from chapter 64, HTSUS \"[f]ootwear without applied soles, of textile material (Chapter 61 or 62)\"). More specifically, headings 6111, HTSUS (\"Babies' garments and clothing accessories,\" of knitted or crocheted fabrics) and 6209, HTSUS (\"Babies' garments and clothing accessories,\" of fabrics other than knitted or crocheted fabrics) include certain types of baby booties. The booties of these headings are those \"without an outer sole glued, sewn, or otherwise affixed or applied to the upper.\" ENs 61.11, 62.09;\n   <em>\n    see\n   </em>\n   Note 1(a) to Chapter 64, HTSUS.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-187\">\n   The court's examination of the samples and illustrations reveals that the Baby Booties have outer soles that are separate from the uppers and are sewn to the uppers at the bottom edge. As shown by labels on the samples, the uppers are made\n   of \"polyester fiber\" and the soles are \"100% cotton.\" They are, therefore, not excluded from chapter 64, HTSUS by reason of their construction. Within chapter 64, the first four headings do not describe the baby booties.\n   <em>\n    See\n   </em>\n   HTSUS headings 6401 (certain waterproof footwear), 6402 (footwear with outer soles and uppers of rubber or plastics), 6403 (footwear with outer soles of rubber, plastics, leather or composition leather and uppers of leather), and 6404 (footwear with outer soles of rubber, plastics, leather or composition leather and textile uppers). The Baby Booties are described by the terms of heading 6405, HTSUS (\"Other footwear\"). Within the heading, subheading 6405.20.90, HTSUS applies to \"[o]ther footwear: [w]ith uppers of textile materials: [o]ther,\" subject to duty at 12.5%\n   <em>\n    ad val.\n   </em>\n   This is the classification determined by Customs upon liquidation.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-188\">\n   Plaintiff submits that the Baby Booties are excluded from classification in heading 6405, HTSUS, arguing that\n   <em>\n    Michael Simon Design\n   </em>\n   \"rejected\" the \"argument that 'normal articles of apparel' were excluded from classification under Heading 9505, HTSUS.\" Pl.'s Mot. 27 (citation omitted). This argument is unpersuasive because the Baby Booties are footwear, not apparel. As the court has pointed out, these goods, having outer soles that are separate from the uppers, are classified in section XII, HTSUS (\"Footwear, gaiters and the like; parts of such articles\"), not in section XI, HTSUS (\"Textile and textile articles\"). Because\n   <em>\n    Michael Simon Design\n   </em>\n   did not involve the tariff classification of footwear bur rather involved apparel, specifically, certain sweaters with Christmas or Halloween motifs, the case does not establish a precedent controlling on the tariff classification issue presented by the Baby Booties. It is also dissimilar to this case with respect to certain of its reasoning. In significant part, the Court of Appeals based its conclusion that the sweaters with holiday or similar themes were to be classified under heading 9505, HTSUS rather than within chapter 61, HTSUS on the effect of note 1(t) to section XI, HTSUS (providing that section XI (which includes the apparel chapters, chapters 61 and 62, HTSUS) \"does not cover: ... [a]rticles of chapter 95 (for example, toys, games, sports requisites and nets)\").\n   <em>\n    See\n   </em>\n   <em>\n    Michael Simon Design\n   </em>\n   ,\n   <extracted-citation case-ids=\"3707620\" index=\"62\" url=\"https://cite.case.law/f3d/501/1303/\">\n    501 F.3d at 1306\n   </extracted-citation>\n   (\"The notes to Section XI of the HTSUS, in which chapters 61 and 62 fall, expressly state that the section does not cover articles of chapter 95.

The HTSUS does not contain a provision for chapter 64 (\"Footwear, gaiters and the like ...\"), which is in section XII, that is analogous to note 1(t) to section XI.\n   <footnotemark>\n    14\n   </footnotemark>\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-189\">\n   Plaintiff also argues that the Baby Booties are excluded from classification under heading 6405, HTSUS by note 1(e) to chapter 64, HTSUS. Pl.'s Reply 22-23. That note states that chapter 64, HTSUS \"does not cover: ... [t]oy footwear or skating boots with ice or roller skates attached.\" Note 1(e) to Chapter 64, HTSUS. Plaintiff argues that the Baby Booties are\n   \"toy footwear\" on the premise that they \"qualify under the recognized definition of 'toys' \" because they \"provide the same degree of 'entertainment, amusement or merriment' to enhance 'the state of merriment at the yuletide [or other festive] holiday season' as recognized by the courts as indicative of festive articles.\" Pl.'s Reply 23 (quoting\n   <em>\n    Midwest of Cannon Falls\n   </em>\n   ,\n   <extracted-citation case-ids=\"302485\" index=\"63\" url=\"https://cite.case.law/f3d/122/1423/\">\n    122 F.3d at 1427\n   </extracted-citation>\n   . This argument fails to confront the uncontested fact that the Baby Booties are designed as real footwear for infants, not playthings for children or adults. While some footwear (specifically, sportswear) is identified by note 1(e) as falling within chapter 95, HTSUS (the chapter plaintiff submits is correct), the note, notably, does not provide for classification of footwear within heading 9505, HTSUS.\n   <em>\n    See\n   </em>\n   Note 1(e) to Chapter 64, HTSUS (excluding from chapter 64 \"[t]oy footwear or skating boots with ice or roller skates attached; shin-guards or similar protective sportswear (chapter 95)\").\n   <footnotemark>\n    15\n   </footnotemark>\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-190\">\n   Nor can the court find an intent on the part of the HS drafters that within chapter 95, HS heading 95.05 is sufficiently broad in scope to encompass footwear of any kind. As the court discussed previously, the court's understanding of the meaning the HS drafters intended for the term \"festive, carnival or other entertainment articles\" is informed by the examples given in EN 95.05, which describe: (1) \"decorations\" and \"decorative articles\"; (2) \"[a]rticles traditionally used at Christmas festivities\" such as artificial Christmas trees, nativity scenes, Christmas crackers, Christmas stockings and imitation yule logs; (3) \"fancy dress\" i.e., costume, articles such as masks and false beards and mustaches, not including apparel articles made of textiles; (4) \"[t]hrow-balls of paper or cotton-wool, paper streamers ... cardboard trumpets\" and the like; and (5) magic tricks and practical joke items. All the examples are dissimilar to the footwear at issue.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-191\">\n   In summary, the court concludes that the classification of the Baby Booties determined by Customs upon liquidation, subheading 6405.20.90, HTSUS (\"Other footwear: With uppers of textile materials: Other\"), subject to duty at 12.5%\n   <em>\n    ad val.\n   </em>\n   , was correct.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-192\">\n   <em>\n    D. Defendant's Objection to Plaintiff's Exhibits 42, 43, 44, 45 and 46\n   </em>\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-193\">\n   Defendant objects to plaintiff's revised exhibits 42, 43, 44, 45, and 46, which plaintiff submits are pages from Russ Berrie &amp; Co. catalogs, arguing that evidence that would be admissible at trial has not been presented to authenticate these catalog pages, to establish that they were published or distributed, or that the articles therein were for sale or display during the period of importation. Def.'s Reply 6. The court interprets the real basis of defendant's objection to be that the catalog pages would not be admissible for the purpose of showing that merchandise shown therein was associated with, or sold during, certain holidays or festive occasions. In response to defendant's argument, plaintiff submitted two affidavits from former Russ Berrie &amp; Co. employees, endeavoring to authenticate the catalog pages.\n   <em>\n    See\n   </em>\n   Pl.'s Reply 7-8 and accompanying affidavits. Defendant responds that these affidavits violate USCIT Rule 26 because neither employee \"was identified during the discovery phase of this action as persons with information upon which Russ Berrie\n   would rely.\" Def.'s Reply 4-5. Defendant also opposed a third affidavit from the former head of the plaintiff company, Mr. Russ Berrie himself, because of the affiant's death \"over seven years before the complaint in this action was filed,\" which prevented defendant from cross-examining the affiant in this action. Def.'s Mot. 2 n.3.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-194\">\n   As to an evidentiary objection grounded in the timing of holidays or festive events, and as to all merchandise except for the Etched Images Plaque, the court considers defendant's objection to the five revised exhibits to be moot because the court concludes that the articles at issue are not classifiable as festive or other entertainment articles of heading 9505, HTSUS, for the reasons discussed previously. This is the case regardless of whether these goods can be shown to have been advertised in a seasonal or holiday catalog or imported or sold during certain times of the year. The court concludes that defendant's evidentiary objection must be overruled to the extent that it might be construed to object to introduction of the pages for a purpose\n   <em>\n    other than\n   </em>\n   to show a relationship to a holiday or festive occasion. The court concludes that, in the situation in which samples are no longer available, the catalog pages could be shown to be admissible to demonstrate the appearance of these items. Because the catalog pages are the\n   <em>\n    only\n   </em>\n   evidence that could be introduced for this purpose, the court disagrees with defendant that these pages necessarily would be required to be excluded at trial as inadmissible. The situation the court describes, i.e., where no samples are available and it is necessary to view the appearance of the articles, occurred with respect to certain articles on revised exhibit 42 (Christmas Hugs and certain Baby Booties) and revised exhibit 43 (Haunting Horrors, Bobbling Bones, Goonie Goblin Finger Puppets, the Trick 'n Treat Fun Center, and other Baby Booties). As to all of these items, the catalog pages are part of the basis for the court's conclusions as to classification, in particular the conclusion that none of these goods falls within the meaning of the term \"festive ... or other entertainment articles\" as used in heading 9505 (although the Trick 'n Treat Fun Center contained Squirt Balls that the court ruled to be classified under a different term of that heading, a classification to which defendant agrees). Despite its objection to the exhibits, defendant nevertheless has moved for summary judgment on the articles at issue, even though, in the absence of samples, the catalog pages are the only evidence of the appearance of the merchandise.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-195\">\n   In summary, defendant's evidentiary objections are directed to catalog pages that associate merchandise with particular holidays or festive events, and defendant makes these objections in support of its position that the articles at issue are not properly classified as \"festive ... or other entertainment articles\" under heading 9505, HTSUS. The court has rejected plaintiff's argument that any of the merchandise depicted in the catalogs (with the exception of the Etched Images Plaque, above) fall within the meaning of that heading term. The court concludes that there is no genuine issue of material fact as to any of these articles, and defendant's arguments as to the proper classification, as a general matter, have prevailed in this action as to each of them.\n   <footnotemark>\n    16\n   </footnotemark>\n   The Etched\n   Images Plaque appeared in an Easter catalog of Russ Berrie &amp; Co., to which defendant's evidentiary objection applies. No catalog page is required for the court to reach the classification determination for that article, for which the sample itself is more than sufficient to demonstrate that the article is decorative and symbolic of Easter. In light of the sample, there is no genuine issue of material fact as to what that merchandise is.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-196\">\n   <em>\n    E. Preparations for Entry of Judgment to Resolve this Action\n   </em>\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-197\">\n   Although plaintiff has submitted a list of articles identified as the subject of stipulation, no stipulation on behalf of both parties has been submitted.\n   <footnotemark>\n    17\n   </footnotemark>\n   <em>\n    See\n   </em>\n   Pl.'s Mot. 29 (listing articles to which the parties agree to settle and citing Pl.'s Ex. 48); Def.'s Mot. 2 (stating that the parties have agreed to settle certain claims, also citing Pl.'s Ex. 48). Therefore, the court is unable to enter a judgment that resolves this case in the entirety, and the court finds no justification for entering a partial judgment according to USCIT Rule 54(b). Instead, the court will order the parties to submit a proposed judgment that directs the reliquidations necessary to effectuate the court's classification decisions on the articles that remained in dispute (ordering appropriate refunds with interest as provided by law), encompasses and identifies precisely the stipulations to which the parties have agreed, and specifies that plaintiff's remaining claims are abandoned.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-198\">\n   <strong>\n    <em>\n     III.
