This case was removed to federal court [ECF No. 1] on August 25, 2017. On August 31, 2017, the Fund filed a Motion for Judgment on the Administrative Record [ECF No. 7], to which the Plaintiff responded on April 30, 2018 [ECF No. 44], and the Fund replied on May 11, 2018 [ECF No. 46]. The Plaintiff filed an Amended Complaint with leave of Court on March 27, 2018 [ECF No. 37], which clarified that she was asserting both a claim under the Employee Retirement Income Security Act of 1974, as amended (ERISA),\n   <extracted-citation index=\"0\" url=\"https://cite.case.law/citations/?q=29%20U.S.C.%20%C2%A7%201002\">\n    29 U.S.C. \u00a7 1002\n   </extracted-citation>\n   (2)(A) as well as a state law claim for conversion. The Fund filed a Motion to Dismiss [ECF No. 42] the Plaintiff's state law conversion claim on the grounds that the claim was preempted. The Plaintiff responded on April 24, 2018 [ECF No. 43], and the Fund replied on May 1, 2018 [ECF No. 45]. Subsequently, the Fund filed a Motion to Transfer Case [ECF No. 47] on June 6, 2018, arguing that the Southern District of Ohio is a more appropriate forum. The Plaintiff responded [ECF No. 48] on June 19, 2018, and the Fund replied [ECF No. 49] on June 26, 2018. These issues are now fully briefed and ripe for review.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-11\">\n   <strong>\n    BACKGROUND\n   </strong>\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-12\">\n   The Fund is an \"employee pension benefit plan\" within the meaning of ERISA \u00a7 2(2)(A) and a \"multiemployer plan\" within the meaning of ERISA\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-13\">\n   \u00a7 2(37)(A). In January 2013, Garland Smith retired and elected to receive a single life annuity payment option (the Plan), terminating upon his death. At the time of his election, Smith and the Plaintiff were married. Smith's Plan provided that if Smith died prior to receiving sixty monthly payments, his named beneficiary would receive the balance of those payments, but would not be entitled to any further payments. However, if Smith died after sixty payments had been tendered, the named beneficiary would not receive any payments.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-14\">\n   Smith submitted an application for benefits pursuant to the Plan on January 18, 2013, and his benefits commenced on February 1, 2013. In January 2016, Smith and the Plaintiff divorced. On February 29, 2016, after dissolution of the marriage, the Fund received a proposed domestic relations order (DRO); however, the Fund found that the DRO was non-compliant with ERISA and the Fund's policies. By letter dated May 23, 2016, the Fund advised the Plaintiff and Smith that it would segregate the forty percent allotted to the Plaintiff for eighteen months or until it was presented with a qualified DRO. If the Plaintiff and Smith did not submit a qualified DRO within the eighteen months, the segregated amount would be paid to Smith.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-15\">\n   On May 18, 2016, the Plaintiff inquired whether a DRO that provided for continued payments to her beneficiaries if she predeceases Smith, even after the first sixty payments had been tendered, would be a qualified DRO. Notwithstanding this inquiry, on May 24, 2016, the Plaintiff submitted a DRO that did not include such a provision, which the Fund determined was a qualified DRO and issued a letter of compliance on June 1, 2016. On June 2, 2016, the Plaintiff again inquired as to whether a DRO that provided for continued payments to her beneficiaries even if she died after the first sixty payments would be a qualified DRO. The Fund responded by letter dated June 9, 2016, that \"an order containing such a provision would fail to be a complying order under the Fund's procedure.\" (A.R. 10052, ECF No. 7-1.) In November 2016, the Whitley Circuit Court issued the DRO at issue in this case [ECF No. 5 at 11-14], which the Plaintiff submitted on November 18, 2016. This DRO included the provision regarding the Plaintiff's beneficiaries despite the Fund's advisement that the DRO would be non-compliant. Specifically, the DRO provides that the Plaintiff is to receive forty percent of Smith's monthly payments and that if the Plaintiff predeceases Smith, her beneficiaries or her estate will continue to receive forty percent of the payments. (\n   <em>\n    See\n   </em>\n   DRO at 2-3.) However, if the Plaintiff dies after Smith, her interest in the Plan payments will cease at the end of the first sixty months, and no further payments would be tendered to her beneficiaries. (\n   <em>\n    Id.\n   </em>\n   at 3.) The Fund responded by letter dated December 5, 2016, that the modified DRO was not qualified because it conflicted with the terms of the Plan.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-16\">\n   Through counsel, the Plaintiff appealed the Fund's decision on January 31, 2017, including the Fund's decision to segregate the Plaintiff's forty-percent entitlement. The Fund responded on February 3, 2017, maintaining its position that the November 2016 DRO was unqualified, denying the Plaintiff's request for an \"expedited appeal,\" and inquiring whether the Plaintiff would like her appeal heard at the upcoming Trustees' meeting on March 14, 2017. The Plaintiff did not respond prior to March 14, 2017, and her appeal therefore was not heard on that date. Instead, the Plaintiff's appeal was heard at the Trustees' meeting on May 11, 2017, and, after consideration, the Trustees, as Plan administrators,\n   denied the Plaintiff's appeal. Along with a denial letter explaining their decision, the Trustees advised the Plaintiff of her right to file a lawsuit under \u00a7 502(a) of ERISA.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-17\">\n   On August 3, 2017, the Plaintiff filed her claim against the Fund requesting \"equitable relief\" in the form of damages as well as asserting a claim for conversion in violation of Indiana Administrative Code (IAC) \u00a7 34-24-3-1. With leave of Court, the Plaintiff amended her Complaint on March 27, 2018. In her Amended Complaint, the Plaintiff alleges violations of \u00a7 502(a)(1)(B) of ERISA and IAC \u00a7 34-24-3-1.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-18\">\n   In its Motion for Judgment on the Administrative Record,\n   <footnotemark>\n    1\n   </footnotemark>\n   the Fund argues that the Court must review the Trustees' decision under an \"arbitrary and capricious\" standard and therefore may review only the record that was before the Trustees. Thus, the Fund argues, because the Administrative Record has been made of record in this case, judgment is appropriate as to the Plaintiff's ERISA claim. The Fund also argues that the Court should dismiss the Plaintiff's conversion claim because it is preempted by ERISA.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-19\">\n   <strong>\n    ANALYSIS\n   </strong>\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-20\">\n   <strong>\n    A.

Thus, the Court concludes that the alleged breaches took place in the Northern District of Indiana.

The analysis regarding the interests of justice focuses on the efficient administration of the court system.\n   <em>\n    See\n   </em>\n   <em>\n    Coffey\n   </em>\n   ,\n   <extracted-citation case-ids=\"1619954\" index=\"14\" url=\"https://cite.case.law/f2d/796/217/#p219\">\n    796 F.2d at 219-20\n   </extracted-citation>\n   .

In this case, the Fund, as the party moving for transfer, \"has the burden of establishing, by reference to particular circumstances, that the transferee forum is clearly more convenient.\"\n   <em>\n    Coffey\n   </em>\n   ,\n   <extracted-citation case-ids=\"1619954\" index=\"16\" url=\"https://cite.case.law/f2d/796/217/#p219\">\n    796 F.2d at 220\n   </extracted-citation>\n   .\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-25\">\n   The Fund argues that the Southern District of Ohio is a more appropriate venue to litigate this dispute because (1) Ohio was the situs of material events; (2) the sources of proof are located in Ohio; (3) Ohio is not inconvenient to the Plaintiff; and (4) Ohio is more convenient for potential witnesses. The Fund also argues that transfer would be in the interests of justice regardless of the convenience of the parties because the Southern District of Ohio statistically provides a speedier path to resolution of the dispute.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-26\">\n   First, the Court is not persuaded by the Fund's \"interests of justice\" argument. The Court is disposing of the Fund's dispositive Motions concurrently with its Motion to Transfer. At this point in the litigation, the Court is skeptical that this case could be resolved any more efficiently by transfer to another district.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-27\">\n   The Fund argues that the situs of the material events \"weighs substantially and solely\" in favor of transfer because at issue in this case is a decision that was made in Ohio. The Court is not persuaded by this argument. The Court has already determined that venue in this district is proper because the alleged breach of the Plan occurred in this district. At minimum, it can be said that material events related to the instant case occurred in both districts, and this factor therefore weighs neutrally in the Court's analysis. The Court is also not persuaded that the location of sources of proof militate in favor of transfer. In filing its Motion for Judgment on the Administrative Record, the Fund asserts that all of the evidence necessary to resolve the case is already before the Court. The location of the original documents and the witnesses to the creation of\n   those documents are irrelevant to the Court's review of the record and determination of the merits of the case. Nor is the Court persuaded that any overall convenience to the parties or their witnesses will be served by transfer. As to the witnesses, neither party asserts that any witnesses are necessary to the resolution of this case. Moreover, the Fund acknowledges that the Northern District of Indiana is a more convenient venue for the Plaintiff. Other than the reasons cited above, which the Court does not find persuasive, the Fund does not offer any reasons that demonstrate that the convenience gained by the Fund by litigating in the Southern District of Ohio outweighs the convenience lost to the Plaintiff. \"Where the parties each reside in different states, there is no choice of forum that will avoid imposing inconvenience on one or the other, and 'the tie is awarded to the plaintiff.' \"\n   <em>\n    Bethany Lowe Designs Inc. v.

Therefore, the Court does not find that the Southern District of Ohio is \"clearly more convenient,\" and the Court will deny the Fund's Motion to Transfer.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-28\">\n   <strong>\n    B. Motion for Judgment on the Administrative Record\n   </strong>\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-29\">\n   <strong>\n    <em>\n     1. Procedure\n    </em>\n   </strong>\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-30\">\n   The Plaintiff's first argument regarding the Fund's Motion for Judgment on the Administrative Record is that it is procedurally improper because it is not a recognized motion under the Federal Rules of Civil Procedure. Rather, such a motion is a creature of the Rules of the United States Court of Federal Claims. The Plaintiff argues that the proper procedural vehicle would have been a motion for summary judgment, citing\n   <em>\n    Evanston Community Consolidated School District Number 65 v. Michael M.\n   </em>\n   ,\n   <extracted-citation case-ids=\"785323\" index=\"19\" url=\"https://cite.case.law/f3d/356/798/#p802\">\n    356 F.3d 798\n   </extracted-citation>\n   , 802 (7th Cir. 2004).\n   <footnotemark>\n    2\n   </footnotemark>\n   The Court previously determined that the Fund's Motion was not a motion for summary judgment. (\n   <em>\n    See\n   </em>\n   ECF No. 10.) Thus, the Plaintiff asserts, \"[t]he Court would be well within its discretion to decline to rule on the Fund's motion and order the Fund to file a proper summary judgment motion in compliance with Federal Rule of Civil Procedure 56.\" (Pl. Resp. to Def. Mot. for Judgment on the Admin. Record at 5, ECF No. 44.) However, the sua sponte determination that the Motion for Judgment was not a summary judgment motion was for the purposes of clarifying briefing deadlines and says nothing regarding the procedural effect of the Motion. And, as noted below, the Court is limited to the evidence that was before the Plan administrators, and the Plaintiff has not argued that there is any evidence to be introduced as to the substance of her \u00a7 502(a) claim that is not already part of the record. The Court sees no benefit in requiring the Fund to re-file the substance of its Motion in the form of a summary judgment motion.\n   <footnotemark>\n    3\n   </footnotemark>\n   The Plaintiff\n   has produced no authority within the Seventh Circuit in which a court declined to review a motion for judgment on the administrative record on such a procedural technicality. To the contrary, courts in the Seventh Circuit consider such motions on their merits.\n   <em>\n    See, e.g.\n   </em>\n   ,\n   <em>\n    Dorris v. Unum Life Ins.

June 27, 2006). Nor is there any prejudice to the Plaintiff as she has fully responded to the merits of the Fund's argument.

Thus, the Trustees have an obligation to determine whether the DRO is qualified in accordance with the Plan. The Plaintiff argues that this requires interpretation of the DRO, and the Fund argues that this requires an interpretation of the Plan. The provision of the DRO that is at issue states:\n  </p>\n  <blockquote id=\"p-36\">\n   If the Alternate Payee's death occurs before the Participant's death, the\n   monthly amount assigned to the Alternate Payee pursuant to Section 7 of this Order shall be paid to Alternate Payee's named beneficiary(ies) or to Alternate Payee's estate if no beneficiary has been named; however, all payments to Alternate Payee's beneficiary(ies) shall cease upon Participant's death if Participant's death occurs after the five year guaranteed payment period.\n  </blockquote>\n  <p id=\"p-37\">\n   (\n   <em>\n    See\n   </em>\n   DRO, ECF No. 1-3.) The Court finds that there is no question as to what the DRO requires. The DRO permits the Alternate Payee (the Plaintiff) to name a beneficiary to receive the allotted benefits subsequent to the Plaintiff's death but prior to either the sixtieth monthly payment to Smith or Smith's death, whichever comes later. What is not clear is whether this provision conflicts with the Plan. The parties do not argue that there are any other statutory requirements regarding the DRO that the Court must interpret. Therefore, it is the interpretation of the Plan that is at issue, not the interpretation of the DRO.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-38\">\n   <strong>\n    <em>\n     3.

The Trustees reasoned that permitting the Plaintiff to name a beneficiary was a right that was greater than that awarded to Smith as the plan participant.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-72\">\n   The Trustees' reasoning for rejecting the Plaintiff's DRO is as follows: the Plan provides for a minimum term of sixty months during which payments will be made to Smith or his beneficiaries. Thus, the Plan provides that if Smith dies prior to the expiration of the guaranteed sixty-month period his named beneficiary will continue to receive benefits until the sixtieth payment. However, if Smith dies after the expiration of the guaranteed sixty-month period, his beneficiary will not receive any benefits. For the purposes of ERISA, the Plaintiff is a beneficiary. As such, if Smith dies prior to the expiration of the sixty-month period, she would continue to receive her allotted portion of benefits until the sixtieth payment. If Smith dies after the expiration of the sixty-month period, however, all payments to the Plaintiff would cease at the time of his death. If the Plaintiff were able to name a beneficiary who would receive her allotted portion of benefits in the event of her death, that beneficiary would be able to collect benefits after the expiration of the sixty-month period-so long as Smith is alive-whereas Smith's named beneficiary would have no right to payments past the sixty-month period in the event of Smith's death. Thus, by being able to name a beneficiary that could receive payments past the sixty-month period in the event of the Plaintiff's death, the Plaintiff would be exercising a right not provided to Smith. Therefore, the Trustees reasoned, the DRO attempts to confer a \"type or form of benefit, or any option, not otherwise provided under the plan\" in violation of\n   <extracted-citation index=\"70\" url=\"https://cite.case.law/citations/?q=29%20U.S.C.%20%C2%A7%201056\">\n    29 U.S.C. \u00a7 1056\n   </extracted-citation>\n   (d)(3)(D)(i).\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-73\">\n   The Trustees' logic is critically flawed. The language of\n   <extracted-citation index=\"71\" url=\"https://cite.case.law/citations/?q=29%20U.S.C.%20%C2%A7%201056\">\n    29 U.S.C. \u00a7 1056\n   </extracted-citation>\n   (d)(3)(D)(i)\"only bars a QDRO from requiring a plan to affirmatively afford a type or form of benefit not established under that plan.\"\n   <em>\n    DeFazio v. Hollister, Inc.\n   </em>\n   ,\n   <extracted-citation case-ids=\"4171325\" index=\"72\" url=\"https://cite.case.law/f-supp-2d/636/1045/#p1078\">\n    636 F.Supp.2d 1045\n   </extracted-citation>\n   , 1078 (E.D. Cal. 2009). Circumstances under which courts have held that a QDRO required a plan to afford a type or form of benefit not otherwise established include requiring a lump sum payment instead of payment over a period of years, see\n   <em>\n    Patton v. Denver Post Corp.\n   </em>\n   ,\n   <extracted-citation case-ids=\"9319179\" index=\"73\" url=\"https://cite.case.law/f3d/326/1148/#p1152\">\n    326 F.3d 1148\n   </extracted-citation>\n   , 1152 (10th Cir. 2003), or requiring early payment of benefits, see\n   <em>\n    Dickerson v. Dickerson\n   </em>\n   ,\n   <extracted-citation case-ids=\"3768478\" index=\"74\" url=\"https://cite.case.law/f-supp/803/127/#p134\">\n    803 F.Supp. 127\n   </extracted-citation>\n   , 134 (E.D. Tenn. 1992). These are not the circumstances here. The DRO does not change the type or the form of payments made: payments are still to be made in monthly installments, with a guaranteed period of sixty months, and will still cease upon Smith's death if he were to die after the guaranteed sixty-month period.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-74\">\n   Nor does the DRO provide an \"option\" not otherwise provided under the Plan. The Fund does not take issue with the Plaintiff's naming of a beneficiary. (\n   <em>\n    See\n   </em>\n   Mot. for Judgment on the Admin. R. 17 ). In fact, one of the Fund's proposed solutions to the disagreement allowed the DRO to provide that the Plaintiff could name a beneficiary. (\n   <em>\n    Id.\n   </em>\n   ). Rather, the Fund takes issue with the fact that the Plaintiff's named beneficiary could receive payments beyond the sixty-month guaranteed period. But equating the\n   <em>\n    Plaintiff's\n   </em>\n   named beneficiary's ability to receive payments past the sixty-month period with\n   <em>\n    Smith's\n   </em>\n   named beneficiary's ability to receive payments\n   past the sixty-month period is not an appropriate comparison of the rights and options conferred under the Plan. Smith, as the Plan participant, is guaranteed payment until the sixtieth month or his death, whichever comes later. When that happens, all liability of the Fund ceases. Contrariwise, the death of the Plaintiff in no way changes the liability of the Fund in terms of total benefits to be paid or the manner in which they are tendered. If the Plaintiff outlives Smith, she would be entitled to her allotted amount only until the expiration of the sixty months or Smith's death, whichever comes later. There is no reason that her beneficiary cannot likewise collect benefits until the expiration of the sixty months or Smith's death, whichever comes later. The Plan is concerned with the lifespan of Smith, not the lifespan of the Plaintiff. \"A domestic relations order shall not be treated as failing to meet the requirements of [ \u00a7 1056(d)(3)(D)(i) ] solely because such order requires that the payment of benefits be made to an alternate payee ... in any form in which such benefits may be paid under the plan to the participant (other than in the form of a joint and survivor annuity with respect to the alternate payee and his or her subsequent spouse).\" \u00a7 1056(d)(3)(E)(i)(III). The DRO does not change the total liability of the Fund and does not require benefits to be paid in a different form or at a different time; it only directs to whom payments will be made and in what percentage.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-75\">\n   This flaw in the Trustees' reasoning is fatal to the Fund's argument. The Court cannot say that there is a reasoned explanation for the Trustees' decision, that the Trustees based their decision on a reasonable explanation of the relevant Plan documents, or that the decision encompassed the important aspects of the problem.\n   <em>\n    See\n   </em>\n   <em>\n    Hess\n   </em>\n   ,\n   <extracted-citation case-ids=\"9457467\" index=\"75\" url=\"https://cite.case.law/f3d/274/456/#p461\">\n    274 F.3d at 461\n   </extracted-citation>\n   . The Fund has offered no other persuasive reasons as to why the DRO is unqualified. Therefore, the Court finds that the Trustees' decision to deny the payment of benefits because of its determination that the DRO was not qualified was arbitrary and capricious.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-76\">\n   <strong>\n    <em>\n     6. Whether the Segregation of Funds was Arbitrary and Capricious\n    </em>\n   </strong>\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-77\">\n   The Fund has also moved for judgment on the administrative record regarding the Plaintiff's contention that the funds were improperly segregated in violation of \u00a7 502(a). The Fund argues that the Plan clearly provides that, until the Trustees are presented with a purported QDRO, funds allotted to a beneficiary such as the Plaintiff would be segregated for up to eighteen months, at which point, if the Trustees determined that the DRO was not, in fact qualified, the segregated funds would be payable to the Plan participant, Smith, as if there had been no DRO. The funds would be payable to the beneficiary only upon a final determination that the DRO was qualified.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-78\">\n   The Trustees began withholding the Plaintiff's interest in Smith's benefits upon receiving a DRO submitted on May 24, 2016, (prior to the amended DRO now at issue). The relevant period for determination of whether the DRO was qualified or submission of another DRO that was determined to be qualified ended in November 2017. To date, none of these segregated funds have been dispersed either to the Plaintiff or to Smith.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-79\">\n   The segregation provision is in accordance with statutory requirements, which provide, in part:\n  </p>\n  <blockquote id=\"p-80\">\n   During any period in which the issue of whether a domestic relations order is a qualified domestic relations order is being determined (by the plan administrator, by a court of competent jurisdiction, or otherwise), the plan administrator shall separately account for the amounts\n   ... which would have been payable to the alternate payee during such period if the order had been determined to be a qualified domestic relations order.\n  </blockquote>\n  <p id=\"p-81\">\n   \u00a7 1056(d)(3)(H)(i).\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-82\">\n   The Plaintiff has offered no reason why the segregation of funds in compliance with ERISA was improper other than her argument that the DRO at issue was qualified and, therefore, the Fund should have disbursed payment. The decision to continue to segregate the Plaintiff's funds was consistent with the Trustees' decision that the DRO was not qualified. However, the Court has found that the DRO was, in fact, qualified and that the Trustees' decision to the contrary was arbitrary and capricious. Therefore, the Court need not pass on whether the decision to segregate the funds at issue was separately arbitrary and capricious.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-83\">\n   <strong>\n    C.

The Plaintiff does not appear to allege such a separate legal duty on the part of the Fund. Further, it seems that the Plaintiff's conversion claim takes issue with the segregation provision in the Plan. Therefore, on the face of the issue, it appears that the Plaintiff's conversion claim is preempted. The Plaintiff responds that ERISA's preemption provision has an exception for QDROs and that the DRO at issue is, in fact, qualified.\n   <em>\n    See\n   </em>\n   <extracted-citation index=\"92\" url=\"https://cite.case.law/citations/?q=29%20U.S.C.%20%C2%A7%201144\">\n    29 U.S.C. \u00a7 1144\n   </extracted-citation>\n   (b)(7) (\"Subsection (a) shall not apply to qualified domestic relations orders....\").
