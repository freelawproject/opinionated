Dkt. No. 633. The jury awarded plaintiffs approximately $27 million in damages.\n   <em>\n    <extracted-citation case-ids=\"1747479\" index=\"26\" url=\"https://cite.case.law/f3d/212/493/\">\n     Id.\n    </extracted-citation>\n   </em>\n   The Court entered judgment on January 29, 2018.

Ariosa argues that the jury's verdict on its licensing defense, affirmative counterclaims, and invalidity defenses is not supported by substantial evidence or is against the clear weight of evidence.\n   <em>\n    <extracted-citation case-ids=\"1747479\" index=\"27\" url=\"https://cite.case.law/f3d/212/493/\">\n     Id.\n    </extracted-citation>\n   </em>\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-25\">\n   <strong>\n    A. Express license and breach of the SSA\n   </strong>\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-26\">\n   The parties dispute whether the license to Illumina IP granted in the SSA encompassed the '794 patent. Ariosa contends that the Court should interpret the terms \"Core IP Rights in Goods\" and \"Secondary IP Rights in Goods\" in the SSA as a matter of law and argues that the '794 patent is not \"Secondary IP,\" but rather is \"Core IP,\" to which the SSA gave Ariosa a license. Dkt. No. 650 at 2-6. According to Ariosa, the Court should interpret \"Illumina Intellectual Property Rights that pertain to the Goods,\" Dkt. No. 648 at 3 (quoting Ex. 615 (SSA) \u00a7 1.), to mean intellectual property rights that have \"a connection with\" Illumina's sequencing equipment. Dkt. No. 648 at 5. Ariosa points to the testimony of Illumina's expert witness, Dr. Cooper, who stated that Ariosa's use of an Illumina sequencer met the \"detecting\" limitation of the asserted '794 patent claims, as evidence that the '794 patent\"has 'a connection with' Illumina's sequencing equipment and clearly fits within the definition of 'Core IP Rights in Goods.' \" Dkt. No. 648 at 4-5. Ariosa argues that Illumina's position during trial, that \"Core IP Rights\" included only patents \"inherent\" in the use of Illumina's sequencers, is contrary to the language of the SSA. Dkt. No. 648 at 5-6.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-27\">\n   Ariosa also argues that Illumina's interpretation of the SSA renders the grant of an express license under the SSA \"nugatory\" because under the doctrine of patent exhaustion, sale of Illumina's sequencer to Ariosa \"automatically exhausted Illumina's right to enforce against Ariosa any patents that were inherently practiced in the use of those sequencers.\"\n   <em>\n    <extracted-citation case-ids=\"1747479\" index=\"28\" url=\"https://cite.case.law/f3d/212/493/\">\n     Id.\n    </extracted-citation>\n   </em>\n   Ariosa argues that because of Ariosa's express license to the '794 patent through the SSA, Illumina was bound by a covenant not to sue Ariosa under the '794 patent. Dkt. No. 648 at 6. Thus, Ariosa contends that Illumina breached the SSA by asserting the '794 patent against Ariosa.\n   <em>\n    <extracted-citation case-ids=\"1747479\" index=\"29\" url=\"https://cite.case.law/f3d/212/493/\">\n     Id.\n    </extracted-citation>\n   </em>\n   Ariosa argues that there is \"no conflicting extrinsic evidence\" related to the interpretation of these terms because \"the testimony of both sides' witnesses concerning their personal understanding of the meaning of the SSA is irrelevant under California law to the interpretation of the agreement.\"\n   <em>\n    Id.\n   </em>\n   at 2.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-28\">\n   Illumina responds that whether it granted a license to the '794 patent under the SSA is a question of fact, and there was substantial evidence to support the jury's verdict finding that there was no such grant of license. Dkt. No. 672 at 10-11. Illumina argues that the trial evidence showed that the '794 patent related to the library prep product, which Ariosa did not\n   buy, and not the sequencers; that the SSA gave Ariosa a license to use the sequencer, but not to use products that Ariosa did not purchase; that the SSA explicitly restricted Ariosa's right to \"practice any patents supposedly exhausted by the sale of the goods\"; and that the trial evidence demonstrated the '794 patent does not require the use of the Illumina sequencer to perform the detection step.\n   <em>\n    Id.\n   </em>\n   at 14-16. Illumina contends that even if the '794 patent were to pertain to \"Goods,\" it would be \"Secondary IP\" excluded by the SSA.\n   <em>\n    Id.\n   </em>\n   at 16-17.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-29\">\n   In California, a trial court employs a three-step process when the meaning of a contract term is disputed.\n   <em>\n    Wolf v.

(\"[W]e're giving you the sequencer. You can develop your own stuff with it; but we're not giving you anything else. That was the idea.\").

Naclerio's testimony makes clear that in Illumina's view, the SSA defined Core IP as related to the product being purchased (i.e., the sequencer), not Core IP in other products, and that all other Secondary IP were excluded from Core IP.\n   <em>\n    Id.\n   </em>\n   at 449:23-450:1.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-34\">\n   Dr. John Stuelpnagel, Ariosa's founder and Executive Chairman, presented conflicting evidence that is relevant to understanding the SSA.\n   <em>\n    Id.\n   </em>\n   at 777:13-15 (\n   <strong>\n    Q.\n   </strong>\n   \"In terms of the negotiating team for the Sale and Supply Agreement, that was your general counsel, Ms. DeVore and Ken Song and yourself; is that correct?\"\n   <strong>\n    A.\n   </strong>\n   \"Correct\").

According to Dr. Stuelpnagel, Core IP Rights are defined as \"intellectual property rights held by Illumina [that] gives [Ariosa] a license to those Illumina Intellectual Property Rights that we need to use the goods, which is the sequencing, and consumables, and/or pertains or relates to the goods.

Anticipation of the '794 patent by Straus\n   </strong>\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-40\">\n   As a threshold matter, Illumina argues that Ariosa is barred from challenging the '794 patent under the doctrine of assignor estoppel because Drs. Stuelpnagel and Oliphant are inventors of the '794 patent, they assigned their rights to the patent to Illumina, and they are in privity with Ariosa. Dkt. No. 672 at 2; Dkt. No. 661. The Court agrees with Illumina. As is discussed more fully in part IV, below, the Court finds that assignor estoppel applies to Ariosa and that the asserted claims of the '794 patent are within the scope of the rights assigned by Drs. Stuelpnagel and Oliphant to Illumina. Accordingly, Ariosa's invalidity defense against the '794 patent must fail.\n   <em>\n    See\n   </em>\n   <em>\n    Diamond Sci. Co. v.

Dr. Cooper's assertion that in Harmony V2, at least 100 different single stranded target-sequences are left over after the two hour period of temperature reduction (and that they first hybridize to the solid support before annealing to the probes) is based on probability and scientific theory. Dr. Cooper explained that first, the earlier portions of the reaction at 70 degrees occur above the melting point of the probes, meaning that the hybridization of the target sequences to the probes only has an opportunity to occur in the latter portion of the process. Trial Tr. at 966:1-8. The jury could have reasonably inferred that this increases the chances of 100 different single-stranded target sequences being present after two hours.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-95\">\n   Dr. Cooper also opined that there are billions of cell-free DNA fragments (some of which contain a target sequence and others of which do not), 6,800 types of target sequences, and over 20,000 different types of probes.\n   <em>\n    See Id.\n   </em>\n   at 965:10-13; 966:14-19. According to Dr. Cooper, because there are so many probes and fragments, they collide with one another and decrease the chances that the probes will hybridize to the proper target sequences within the first two hours.\n   <em>\n    Id.\n   </em>\n   at 966:25-967:1-4. The probes can only hybridize if they attach to a complementary single-stranded target sequence.\n   <em>\n    Id.\n   </em>\n   966:20-24. Dr. Cooper testified that, even if one percent of the fragments remained un-hybridized and therefore single stranded, then there would be at least 100,000 different single-stranded DNA fragments left over.\n   <em>\n    Id.\n   </em>\n   at 967:15-21. Accordingly, by sheer number and probability, there would be at least 100 different single-stranded target sequences.\n   <em>\n    Id.\n   </em>\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-96\">\n   Dr. Cooper also explains how the solid support first attaches to 100 different single-stranded target sequences and how the target sequences then hybridize to the probes. According to Dr. Cooper, after two hours, the solid support is added and the process is \"allow[ed] continued time to proceed.\"\n   <em>\n    See\n   </em>\n   Trial Tr. 464:4-8, 465:1-4. The solid support streptavidin beads can then quickly attach to the target sequences when they are added because of streptavidin's properties and the interactions with biotin-coated cell-free DNA fragments. Trial Tr. 951:14-25-952:1-3.

Given the additional time to proceed following the addition of the solid support, there is still ample time for the 100 single-stranded target sequences (attached to the beads) to hybridize to their respective three probes.\n   <em>\n    Id.\n   </em>\n   at 964:9-965:4; (Hearing Tr. 6/8/2018; p. 21 Ariosa's Slides).\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-97\">\n   Just as the Federal Circuit in\n   <em>\n    Ultradent\n   </em>\n   found that expert testimony based on scientific theory fulfilled the requirement for substantial evidence, this Court finds that Dr. Cooper's testimony, founded upon scientific theory, \"constitutes substantial evidence of infringement.\"\n   <em>\n    See\n   </em>\n   <em>\n    Ultradent\n   </em>\n   at 1070. That Ariosa presented conflicting evidence is not enough to conclude Dr. Cooper's testimony is not substantial.

There was no dispute that in Harmony V2, modified probes are amplified to produce amplicons, and the amplicons are modified to produce the readout cassettes, which are then immobilized.

Accordingly, the relevant inquiry is whether adding the probe, target sequences, and solid support simultaneously, as Harmony V1 does, literally infringes the steps 1(a) and 1(b) of the '749 patent.\n   <em>\n    See\n   </em>\n   '794 Patent at claim 1;\n   <em>\n    Kaneka\n   </em>\n   ,\n   <extracted-citation case-ids=\"4273564\" index=\"136\" url=\"https://cite.case.law/f3d/790/1298/#p1305\">\n    790 F.3d at 1306\n   </extracted-citation>\n   .\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-107\">\n   Plaintiffs presented evidence that it did. Even adding the probes, target sequences and solid support simultaneously, Harmony VI still causes the steps in the '794 patent in first \"providing\" target sequences (with attached solid support) and then \"contacting\" the targeted sequences with the probes. There is an active step or performance of \"providing\" in the form of raising the temperature to 70 degrees, which allows at least 100 single-stranded sequences to be attached to the solid support.\n   <em>\n    See\n   </em>\n   Trial Tr. (1/16/2018) at 960:2-961:7. Afterwards, there is an active step of \"contacting\" in the form of decreasing the temperature from 70 degrees to 30 degrees, as this allows hybridization between the probe and the target sequences (that are already attached to the solid support).\n   <em>\n    Id.\n   </em>\n   at 962:2-962:5 (Dkt. No. 603). Harmony V1, therefore, directly follows the order (of \"providing\" and then \"contacting\") and content of claims 1(a) and 1(b).\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-108\">\n   Plaintiff's expert, Dr. Cooper explained that the melting point of 70 degrees does not allow probes to hybridize to the target sequences, whereas the target sequences are much more likely to attach to the solid support due to their inherent properties. Trial Tr. (1/16/2018) at 955:4-955:25 (Dkt. No. 603). In addition, the binding of the target sequences (through biotin) and the solid support (through streptavidin) is the strongest known non-covalent interaction. Trial Tr. (1/18/2018) at 1439:21-1440:2 (Dkt. No. 598).\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-109\">\n   The designer of Harmony V1, Dr. Oliphant, confirmed Dr. Cooper's position. Dr. Oliphant stated that the attachment of the solid support to the target sequences occurs first before the hybridization of the target sequences to the probes when stating that \"[w]e attempt to-to attach all of the cell-free DNA to the beads,\" and that the \"next step in the process\" was to \"hybridize the locus-specific oligonucleotides.\" Trial Tr. (1/16/2018) at 1091:10-1092:8 (Dkt. No. 603). Given the testimony from Dr. Cooper and Dr. Oliphant, the jury's verdict was not against the great weight of the evidence and the jury could reasonably\n   conclude that the simultaneous addition in Harmony V1 is an insubstantial difference.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-110\">\n   Accordingly, the evidence presented at trial is sufficient to support the jury's finding of infringement since the simultaneous addition of the solid support, probes, and target sequences in Harmony V1 does not prevent steps 1(a) and 1(b) from occurring in the order specified by the Court.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-111\">\n   <strong>\n    b.

Dkt. No. 649 at 19-25. Plaintiffs respond that the jury awarded an amount that was closer to the value presented by defendant's damages expert ($3.3 million) than that offered by plaintiffs' expert ($104.5 million), and therefore the jury \"reached a middle ground\" that took into account both parties' arguments. Dkt. No. 670 at 16-17.

Ariosa agreed to pay a three percent royalty to Illumina, which Illumina \"intended to be [based] on\" the sale price of the Harmony test. Trial Tr. at 461:22-462:2. Subsequent to the SSA, Ariosa entered into a distribution agreement with LabCorp, in which LabCorp would distribute the Harmony test and Ariosa would receive approximately half of that sale price. Trial Tr. at 462:3-7. As a result, Ariosa sought to adjust its three percent royalty fee with Illumina to reflect the new, lower value it was receiving for the Harmony test.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-150\">\n   Illumina's Mr. Naclerio testified as to the parties' 2012 arrangement:\n  </p>\n  <blockquote id=\"p-151\">\n   And, you know, pretty much as soon as we signed this, there was-there was some contention over-for example, we ended up with a three percent test fee in here, which we intended to be on the price of the test, which-which, when we negotiated this, it was our understanding that they were going to sell the test directly. After we signed this, they signed a deal with LabCorp where LabCorp essentially was the distributor. And then they sort of said, well, we-our arrangement with LabCorp is we get, I think, 3-or $400 upfront, add up the 7-or $800, and so we think we should only pay you on the 3-or 400.\n  </blockquote>\n  <p id=\"p-152\">\n   Trial Tr. at 461:22-462:7. As Naclerio's testimony demonstrates, Ariosa initially represented that it would sell the test for $700 to $800, and that Illumina \"intended\" the \"three percent test fee ... to be [based] on the price of the test.\"\n   <em>\n    See\n   </em>\n   Trial Tr. at 461:22-462:7, 1262:16-1263:15. It was only after signing a deal with LabCorp that Ariosa attempted to modify the three percent test fee. Trial Tr. at 462:3-7.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-153\">\n   The Court finds the relevant value for calculating the royalty base is the original figure. Illumina's intention to charge the test fee was based on the original $700 to $800 value. This calculation was closer in time to the day infringement began. Malackowski testified \"that Illumina/Verinata, in the negotiation, would say, look, you can charge whatever you, want, but we're not going to let you pay us a royalty because you decide to drop the price in half, our royalty gets cut in half.\" Trial Tr. at 1193:4-8. Malackowski also explained that \"in a hypothetical, if you're licensing your technology, you're not going to let the buyer get away with deciding how they're going to split up their revenue to pay less on a percentage.\" Trial Tr. at 1263:12-15.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-154\">\n   Naclerio and Malackowski's testimony supports the notion that Illumina hypothetically would have bargained to receive a percentage on the $761 on the date infringement began.

Stuelpnagel and Oliphant assigned their undivided interest in the '794 patent to Illumina when they assigned their interest in the \"entire invention\" disclosed in the '727 application, which later issued as the '794 patent. Dkt. No. 661 at 5-6. Plaintiffs contend that defendant did not present clear and convincing evidence to negate Drs. Stuelpnagel's and Oliphant's presumptive inventorship because they admitted at trial that they contributed to the '794 patent a \"singular idea\" that is claimed in the patent; trial evidence showed that the '794 patent claims encompass their \"singular idea\" even when it is defined narrowly; they admitted at trial to inventing Illumina's Golden Gate product, which the trial evidence showed is covered by the '794 patent ; and the trial evidence showed that Dr. Stuelpnagel never denied his inventorship before this lawsuit was filed.\n   <em>\n    Id.\n   </em>\n   at 7-16.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-255\">\n   Defendant argues that Drs. Stuelpnagel and Oliphant (and therefore Ariosa) are not estopped from challenging the validity of the '794 patent because the invention they assigned is outside the claims of the '794 patent. Dkt. No. 683 at 4. Ariosa argues the doctors' singular idea of extension and ligation was embodied in Claim 5, which was removed from the final '794 patent, thus proving the '794 patent does not encompass the doctors' invention.\n   <em>\n    Id.\n   </em>\n   at 11. Illumina\n   contends that the '794 patent still encompasses the assigned invention because the term \"substantial complementarity\" includes \"perfect complementarity,\" and the allele-specific extension and ligation requirement is fulfilled by claims 2, 13, 19, and 20; for example, it is fulfilled by claim 13 because SNPs are detected and is fulfilled by claim 19 because it adds extension and ligation. Dkt. No. 661 at 10-11. Ariosa responds that the doctors' invention regarding extension and ligation was not embodied in the '794 patent. First, Ariosa argues the \"perfect complementarity\" requirement is missing because substantial complementarity differs from perfect complementarity. Dkt. No. 683 at 14-17. Second, Ariosa contends the allele-specificity aspect is not fulfilled because the perfect complementarity requirement only pertains to \"the approximately\n   <em>\n    four terminal bases of the interrogation position\n   </em>\n   ,\" meaning that being able \"to detect SNPs is irrelevant.\"\n   <em>\n    Id.\n   </em>\n   at 17 (emphasis in original).\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-256\">\n   In response to Illumina's argument regarding the Golden Gate assay, Ariosa contends that \"[n]owhere does Dr. Cooper address whether the Golden Gate assay employs perfect complementarity at the several terminal bases of an interrogation position as Dr[s]. Stuelpnagel and Oliphant conceived.\"\n   <em>\n    Id.\n   </em>\n   at 18 (citations omitted). Moreover, Ariosa argues that the prosecution history of the '727 patent shows that the doctors' invention was removed from the final version of the '794 patent.\n   <em>\n    Id.\n   </em>\n   at 19-20.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-257\">\n   Alternatively, Ariosa argues that, even if claims 19 and 20 embody the assigned invention, those claims are not the subject of the litigation.\n   <em>\n    Id.\n   </em>\n   at 21. Thus, Ariosa contends assignor estoppel should still not preclude Ariosa from challenging the validity of the patent.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-258\">\n   The Federal Circuit has not required that the language of the original application track exactly the language of the patent claims in order for assignor estoppel to apply.\n   <em>\n    See\n   </em>\n   <em>\n    Diamond\n   </em>\n   ,\n   <extracted-citation case-ids=\"1783416\" index=\"237\" url=\"https://cite.case.law/f2d/848/1220/#p1224\">\n    848 F.2d at 1226\n   </extracted-citation>\n   .\n   <em>\n    Diamond\n   </em>\n   , like the present case, involved assigned applications that later became patents.\n   <em>\n    <extracted-citation case-ids=\"1783416\" index=\"238\" url=\"https://cite.case.law/f2d/848/1220/#p1224\">\n     Id.\n    </extracted-citation>\n   </em>\n   In\n   <em>\n    Diamond\n   </em>\n   , the Federal Circuit found the following: \"[t]hat Diamond may have later amended the claims in the application process (a very common occurrence in patent prosecutions), with or without Dr. Welter's assistance, does not give appellants' arguments against estoppel any greater force.\"\n   <em>\n    <extracted-citation case-ids=\"1783416\" index=\"239\" url=\"https://cite.case.law/f2d/848/1220/#p1224\">\n     Id.\n    </extracted-citation>\n   </em>\n   In fact, the Federal Circuit pointed out that \"Dr. Welter assigned the\n   <em>\n    rights\n   </em>\n   to his invention, irrespective of the particular language in the claims describing the inventions when the patents were ultimately granted.\"\n   <em>\n    <extracted-citation case-ids=\"1783416\" index=\"240\" url=\"https://cite.case.law/f2d/848/1220/#p1224\">\n     Id.\n    </extracted-citation>\n   </em>\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-259\">\n   The Federal Circuit in\n   <em>\n    Diamond\n   </em>\n   did outline the following exception to assignor estoppel:\n  </p>\n  <blockquote id=\"p-260\">\n   To the extent that Diamond may have broadened the claims in the patent applications (after the assignments) beyond what could be validly claimed in light of the prior art,\n   <em>\n    Westinghouse\n   </em>\n   may allow appellants to introduce evidence of prior art to narrow the scope of the claims of the patents, which may bring their accused devices outside the scope of the claims of the patents in suit.\n  </blockquote>\n  <p id=\"p-261\">\n   <em>\n    <extracted-citation case-ids=\"5745711\" index=\"241\" url=\"https://cite.case.law/f3d/778/1365/#p1376\">\n     Id.\n    </extracted-citation>\n   </em>\n   (citing\n   <em>\n    Westinghouse Elec. &amp; Mfg.

Dkt. No. 683. The language of Drs. Stuelpnagel and Oliphant's assignment is almost the same as the language of the assignment in\n   <em>\n    BASF\n   </em>\n   . Drs.

When Verizon pays ActiveVideo a per month royalty for each FiOS-TV subscriber, then ActiveVideo is adequately compensated.\"\n   <em>\n    <extracted-citation case-ids=\"3522674\" index=\"274\" url=\"https://cite.case.law/f3d/694/1312/#p1338\">\n     Id.\n    </extracted-citation>\n   </em>\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-281\">\n   As in\n   <em>\n    ActiveVideo\n   </em>\n   , where ActiveVideo licensed its patent to Cablevision, Illumina licenses its NIPT patent pool to various licensees. Additionally, as in\n   <em>\n    ActiveVideo\n   </em>\n   , where the plaintiff received a licensing fee per subscriber, here Illumina receives payment from every company that obtains a license to its patent pool. In the same way that Verizon's use of infringing technology to obtain a subscriber would cause quantifiable harm to ActiveVideo, Ariosa's use of Harmony V2 causes quantifiable harm to Illumina by taking away a potential licensee. Similarly, this quantifiable harm to Illumina is not irreparable and there is no direct competition between Illumina and Ariosa. Rather, the Court finds that only third party licensees directly compete with Ariosa.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-282\">\n   Both parties contest whether AcfS, a product provided by Ariosa, should also fall under the permanent injunction.\n   <em>\n    See\n   </em>\n   Dkt. No. 697-4 at 1; Dkt. No. 684-2 at 7. Given that the Court finds no direct competition between plaintiffs and defendant, the Court finds that the production of AcfS should not be enjoined. If Harmony V2 is not in direct competition, AcfS cannot be in direct competition.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-283\">\n   <strong>\n    2. Adequacy of legal remedies\n   </strong>\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-284\">\n   Plaintiffs argue that monetary damages are inadequate to compensate them because plaintiffs are forced to compete with a multi-national conglomerate and because the injury to Illumina's reputation is not compensable with monetary damages. Dkt. No. 666 at 9-11. Illumina argues that because the patent has not been licensed and has been kept for exclusive use by Illumina, as it is not part of the NIPT patent pool, the company is irreparably damaged by defendant's Harmony tests.\n   <em>\n    <extracted-citation case-ids=\"3522674\" index=\"275\" url=\"https://cite.case.law/f3d/694/1312/#p1338\">\n     Id.\n    </extracted-citation>\n   </em>\n   Illumina states that \"Illumina has not and does not have interest in licensing its patents such as the '794 Patent to suppliers of competing platforms such as Roche.\" Dkt. No. 659-4 at 15.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-285\">\n   Defendant claims that plaintiffs' licensing model shows money damages are adequate. First, Illumina participated in the NIPT market as a licensor. Dkt. No. 682 at 5. Defendant argues that, per plaintiffs' own words, Illumina's business goal remains \"to license everyone.\" Dkt. No. 684-2 at 8. Defendant argues that the trial transcript suggests that Illumina intended to license to as many NIPT companies as possible. Dkt. No. 682 at 5.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-286\">\n   Second, defendant points out that Illumina not only represented it was willing to license the '794 patent to Ariosa, but suggested its very purpose in bringing this lawsuit was to get Ariosa to take a license.\n   <em>\n    Id.\n   </em>\n   at 5-6. Defendant argues that Illumina is not seeking to reserve the '794 patent for its own exclusive use, as it does not use the '794 for either NIPT technology or any other purpose.\n   <em>\n    Id.\n   </em>\n   at 5. According to defendant, the '794's primary use was in GoldenGate, which was discontinued in December of 2015.\n   <em>\n    Id.\n   </em>\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-287\">\n   This Court is unconvinced by Illumina's argument that the harm resulting from competing against Roche is not compensable by monetary damages. The Court finds that, as the Federal Circuit explained in\n   <em>\n    ActiveVideo\n   </em>\n   , in cases such as this one where the licensees compete with the infringer, royalties are adequate forms of compensation.\n   <em>\n    See\n   </em>\n   <em>\n    ActiveVideo\n   </em>\n   , 694 F.3d at 1338.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-288\">\n   In addition, the Federal Circuit ruled on injuries to reputation in\n   <em>\n    Douglass Dynamics, LLC v. Buyers Products Co.\n   </em>\n   ,\n   <extracted-citation case-ids=\"3576874\" index=\"276\" url=\"https://cite.case.law/f3d/717/1336/#p1345\">\n    717 F.3d 1336\n   </extracted-citation>\n   , 1345 (Fed. Cir. 2013). In\n   <em>\n    Douglass\n   </em>\n   ,\n   the patentee never licensed and intentionally chose not to license the infringed patents in order to retain market exclusivity.\n   <em>\n    <extracted-citation case-ids=\"3576874\" index=\"277\" url=\"https://cite.case.law/f3d/717/1336/#p1345\">\n     Id.\n    </extracted-citation>\n   </em>\n   The Federal Circuit ruled that exclusivity \"is an intangible asset that is part of a company's reputation,\" and then proceeded to hold that remedies at law were \"inadequate to compensate Douglass for at least the reputation loss Douglass has suffered from Buyer's infringement.\"\n   <em>\n    <extracted-citation case-ids=\"3576874\" index=\"278\" url=\"https://cite.case.law/f3d/717/1336/#p1345\">\n     Id.\n    </extracted-citation>\n   </em>\n   Thus a company which deliberately does not license an infringed patent has suffered irreparable harm and cannot be adequately compensated by legal remedies.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-289\">\n   As both parties contest whether Illumina intended to license the '794 patent, the Court will focus on the issue of whether Illumina deliberately did not license out its patent to retain market exclusivity. Accordingly, the main inquiry is whether there was an intention to keep the '794 patent, not the NIPT pool, exclusive. During trial, Illumina explicitly attributed the instant litigation to the fact that Roche \"won't take a license to the intellectual property of Illumina, and pay for the intellectual property it uses.\" Trial Tr. 128:5-13. In addition, one of the main contentions at trial was whether Ariosa actually had a license to the '794 patent.\n   <em>\n    See\n   </em>\n   Trial Tr. 139:25-140:1. Based on the record before the Court, it is clear that Illumina intended to license the '794 patent to Ariosa; and, given that Illumina did not have an intention to retain market exclusivity, this Court holds Illumina's argument regarding exclusivity fails.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-290\">\n   <strong>\n    3. Balance of hardships\n   </strong>\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-291\">\n   Plaintiffs argue the balance of hardships between plaintiffs and defendant supports an injunction.\n   <em>\n    See\n   </em>\n   Dkt. No. 666 at 11. Plaintiffs note that Roche bought Ariosa with its \"eyes wide open about the litigation,\" meaning that, having been forewarned of the instant dispute, Roche is precluded from arguing about the resulting hardship of a permanent injunction.\n   <em>\n    <extracted-citation case-ids=\"3576874\" index=\"279\" url=\"https://cite.case.law/f3d/717/1336/#p1345\">\n     Id.\n    </extracted-citation>\n   </em>\n   Defendant argues that the strong possibility of success on an appeal weighs in favor of showing that the balance of hardships should not lead to an injunction. Dkt. No. 682 at 18. Defendant also argues that there will be adverse consequences to Ariosa's business, having invested millions of dollars in the Harmony Test over a period of eight years.\n   <em>\n    Id.\n   </em>\n   at 18-19. Defendant also contends that Illumina will receive its desired royalty payments, and the status-quo of the last six years will remain intact.\n   <em>\n    Id.\n   </em>\n   at 19.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-292\">\n   To determine the balance of hardships, the Court must determine whether Ariosa or Roche is the relevant party. Roche Molecular Systems Inc. bought Ariosa around December 2014. Dkt. No. 517 at 8 n.8. Roche was named a party during the course of this action, but was dismissed pursuant to stipulation and subsequently deemed a party to any judgment. Dkt. No. 375 at 2. As a result, the focus of the trial was on Ariosa. In addition, the jury verdict refers only to Ariosa and does not mention Roche.\n   <em>\n    See\n   </em>\n   Dkt. No. 633. Since the jury considered Ariosa as the relevant party, this Court concludes that Ariosa is the relevant party.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-293\">\n   In\n   <em>\n    Hynix Semiconductor Inc. v. Rambus Inc.\n   </em>\n   ,\n   <extracted-citation case-ids=\"4210487\" index=\"280\" url=\"https://cite.case.law/f-supp-2d/609/951/#p984\">\n    609 F.Supp.2d 951\n   </extracted-citation>\n   , 984 (N.D. Cal. 2009), the district found that \"decimat[ing]\" an infringer's business tips the balance in the favor of the infringer. The court acknowledged the Federal Circuit's ruling that \"[o]ne who\n   <em>\n    elects\n   </em>\n   to build a business on a product found to infringe cannot be heard to complain if an injunction against continuing infringement destroys the business so elected.\"\n   <em>\n    <extracted-citation case-ids=\"4210487\" index=\"281\" url=\"https://cite.case.law/f-supp-2d/609/951/#p984\">\n     Id.\n    </extracted-citation>\n   </em>\n   (quoting\n   <em>\n    Windsurfing Int'l Inc. v.

However, the district court considered that to have changed the technology of the potentially infringing product could cost huge sums of money just \"to avoid infringement\n   of claims that had not yet been adjudicated valid and enforceable.\"\n   <em>\n    Id.\n   </em>\n   at 985. That, coupled with the \"immediate and devastating harm that an injunction would deal,\" tipped the balance in favor of the non-moving party.\n   <em>\n    Id.\n   </em>\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-294\">\n   Ariosa's business will likewise be decimated if a permanent injunction is issued.

In addition, switching from Illumina sequencers would cost \"an enormous amount of resources, time, and dollars.\" Trial Tr. at 1314:2-8. Additionally, Ariosa's claims concerning patent validity were not fully adjudicated until January 2018. At a minimum, based on the specific facts in the present case, the Court finds that the balance of the hardships is neutral and does not favor issuing an injunction.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-295\">\n   <strong>\n    4. Public interest\n   </strong>\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-296\">\n   Plaintiffs argue that courts rarely find an injunction would disserve the public interest after a finding of infringement and that it is in the public interest for patent rights to be respected. Dkt. No. 666 at 12.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-297\">\n   Defendant responds that there is a public interest in competition and consumers should be able to select from a number of different options when choosing a NIPT test. Dkt. No. 682 at 19-20. Defendant also contends there is a strong public interest where, as in here, the patentee does not practice the patent.\n   <em>\n    Id.\n   </em>\n   at 20.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-298\">\n   The Federal Circuit has stated that \"the public interest nearly always weighs in favor of protecting property rights in the absence of countervailing factors, especially when the patentee practices his inventions.\"\n   <em>\n    Apple Inc. v.

Consequently, protecting patent rights generally favors an injunction. Additionally, in most cases, a lack of competition does not demonstrate disservice of the public interest, at least when the competition is induced by the usage of infringed patented inventions.\n   <em>\n    Douglas Dynamics, LLC v. Buyers Products Co.\n   </em>\n   ,\n   <extracted-citation case-ids=\"3576874\" index=\"284\" url=\"https://cite.case.law/f3d/717/1336/#p1345\">\n    717 F.3d 1336\n   </extracted-citation>\n   , 1347 (2013). As a result, Ariosa's argument that there is a strong public interest in competition fails to convince this Court it should not grant a permanent injunction.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-299\">\n   However, the Federal Circuit has noted that the public interest weighs in favor of the patentee \"especially when the patentee practices his inventions.\"\n   <em>\n    Apple\n   </em>\n   , 809 F.3d at 647. Here, the '794 patent is not currently in practice. Its primary iteration was in the now discontinued GoldenGate product.\n   <em>\n    See\n   </em>\n   Trial Tr. (1/8/2018) 133:21-25; Ex.

The court held that it would not permit a preliminary injunction because it is \"inconsistent for plaintiffs to be arguing on one hand that the '723 patent represents an important new invention and then argue on the other hand that it should make no difference if no one is allowed to actually use it.\"\n   <em>\n    Id.\n   </em>\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-301\">\n   Here, much like the defendants in\n   <em>\n    Novozymes\n   </em>\n   who did not practice or license their patent, Illumina does not currently practice the '794 patent.

However, the\n    <em>\n     Old Town Canoe\n    </em>\n    court held that such evidence raised an issue of material fact to be resolved by a jury, and thereby reversed the district court's grant of the patentee's motion for judgment as a matter of law on enablement of the asserted patent.\n    <em>\n     Old Town Canoe\n    </em>\n    ,\n    <extracted-citation case-ids=\"6046486\" index=\"290\" url=\"https://cite.case.law/f3d/448/1309/\">\n     448 F.3d at 1313, 1320\n    </extracted-citation>\n    . Here, the jury was presented with Dr. Cantor's expert opinion on the insufficiency of the '430 patent disclosure for enablement and was entitled to weigh it in arriving at the verdict.\n    <em>\n     See\n    </em>\n    Trial Tr. 1479:5-1481:12.\n   </p>\n  </footnote>\n  <footnote label=\"9\">\n   <p id=\"p-331\">\n    Having heard and considered the trial testimony in this case, this Court is no longer convinced that its claim construction determination regarding the order of steps 1(a) and 1(b) of the '794 patent was correct, or that its preclusion of Illumina from presenting Doctrine of Equivalents evidence about the order of steps was correct.
