As a threshold matter, Defendants argue that Plaintiffs' claims are more properly characterized as personal injury claims, and are therefore barred by the statute of limitations for personal injury.

Here, Defendants dispute whether Plaintiffs' claims may be characterized as constructive fraud claims, because they did not arise out of a commercial transaction, and because they have not alleged any pecuniary damages. The Court finds that neither a commercial transaction nor economic damages are a necessary element of a constructive fraud claim.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-66\">\n   \"[A]lthough it is true that most fraud claims involve monetary damage resulting from business transactions, nothing in Idaho law expressly confines constructive fraud claims to commercial settings.\"\n   <em>\n    Tom Doe v.

Nonetheless, Defendants argue that Plaintiffs' claims are better characterized as personal injury claims rather than as constructive fraud claims. As the Court has previously held in this case, however, \"plaintiffs are not complaining that the Boy Scouts and the LDS Church sexually abused them; they are complaining that these institutions deceived them by telling them to trust their Scoutmasters and, at the same time, not telling them about the dangers of pedophilic Scoutmasters.

The Court disagrees. First, the Defendants' knowledge is not an element of constructive fraud. Unlike a typical fraud claim, Plaintiffs do not need to prove that Defendants knew their statements were false, or that they knowingly failed to warn. Instead, the nature of a constructive fraud claim is that a defendant's knowledge will be inferred as a result of the relationship of trust and confidence between the defendant and the plaintiff.\n   <em>\n    Doe v.

In other words, so long as Plaintiffs establish the requisite relationship, they could allege a claim for constructive fraud even if they had no evidence that either Defendant knew about the abuse in scouting.\n   <em>\n    See\n    <extracted-citation case-ids=\"4186956\" index=\"71\" url=\"https://cite.case.law/idaho/159/103/\">\n     id.\n    </extracted-citation>\n   </em>\n   (citing\n   <em>\n    Country Cove Dev.

Thus, the point at which Plaintiffs discovered that Defendants knew about the abuse is irrelevant to their claim.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-74\">\n   Second, the Court has held that Plaintiffs' claims rest on facts establishing that sexual abuse of scouts, whether by their abusers or by other perpetrators, had occurred or was occurring before the Defendants represented to them that scouting was a safe and wholesome activity.\n   <em>\n    See Doe XII Mem. Decision &amp; Order\n   </em>\n   at 14, Dkt. 240. To put it more clearly, the claim rests on facts establishing that the statements Plaintiffs relied upon were false at the time they were made, or that the risk of harm existed at the time of the omission. As such, Plaintiffs had actual notice of facts underlying the fraud for the purpose of the statute of limitations when they knew of facts establishing that child sexual abuse in scouting predated Defendants' statements or omissions about the safety of scouting. It is therefore the discovery of the fact of prior abuse which transforms Plaintiffs' suspicion of wrongdoing into knowledge of facts necessary to substantiate their claim, not the discovery of the extent of prior abuse.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-75\">\n   Defendants' arguments that Plaintiffs discovered the falsity of any statements or omissions at the time they were abused are unavailing for this same reason. As this Court has stated repeatedly throughout the course of this litigation, a claim for constructive fraud arises out of the false statements or failure to warn, not the damage suffered as a result. The critical fact of the fraud, therefore, is the falsity of the statement at the time it is made, or the existence of a danger at the time the omission occurred.\n   <footnotemark>\n    7\n   </footnotemark>\n   <em>\n    See\n   </em>\n   <em>\n    Obendorf v.

In other words, these Plaintiffs alleged in 2007 that there was an established danger of child sexual abuse in scouting prior to the abuse they suffered, and that Schmidt had already harmed other scouts.

As such, the Court shall grant BSA's motion for summary judgment against Doe I, II, and Doe V, and the Church Defendants motions for summary judgment against Does II and V.

In the alternative, BSA argues that they had constructive\n   notice of the facts underlying the fraud in 2010, when information regarding the existence of the IV files became available to the general public. The Court has already rejected these arguments. BSA offers no other evidence to dispute the assertions by Doe IV and Doe XVIII that they did not discover the facts underlying the fraud until 2012 and 2014 respectively. Nor is there any evidence in the record to suggest that Doe IV and Doe XVII learned of prior abuse in scouting before 2010 and 2012 respectively.

Therefore, if Doe XII knew or reasonably should have known the facts constituting the fraud before February 2011, his claim is barred by the statute of limitations.

As\n   such, there is a genuine issue of material fact as to whether Doe XII intended the Agreement to release his constructive fraud claim, and summary judgment on this issue is therefore precluded.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-94\">\n   Because the Court has found that the claims against BSA by Doe IV, Doe XII, and Doe XVIII are not barred either by the statute of limitations, or by prior release, the Court will now turn the merits of their claims for constructive fraud.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-95\">\n   <strong>\n    4. Elements of Constructive Fraud\n   </strong>\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-96\">\n   BSA argues that Doe IV, Doe XII, and Doe XVIII have failed to establish the requisite elements necessary to prove their claim. At issue, therefore, is whether a reasonable jury could find from the evidence in the record that these Plaintiffs had a relationship of trust and confidence with BSA; that BSA made false statements or failed to warn them about a material danger of child sex abuse in scouting; that these Plaintiffs justifiably relied on such statements and omissions; and whether the injuries alleged were caused by that reliance.

In\n   <em>\n    Tom Doe\n   </em>\n   , this Court declined to find that a plaintiff need establish that there was a\n   particular risk of sexual abuse in Scouting, or that the risk was greater than in society at large.\n   <em>\n    Tom Doe\n   </em>\n   ,\n   <extracted-citation index=\"106\" url=\"https://cite.case.law/citations/?q=2012%20WL%203782454\">\n    2012 WL 3782454\n   </extracted-citation>\n   at *31. BSA has provided no reason why the Court should revisit that holding here. A jury could reasonably find that there was a material danger of sexual abuse in scouting, based on the evidence of actual instances of sexual abuse in the record, including by the perpetrators who abused Does IV, XII, and XVIII. As such, there is a genuine issue of fact as to whether the danger was material, and summary judgment is precluded.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-115\">\n   <strong>\n    E.\n    <em>\n     Reliance and Causation\n    </em>\n   </strong>\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-116\">\n   The Court finds that issues of reliance and causation are questions of fact, which must be decided by the jury. Doe IV, Doe XII, and Doe XVIII each allege that they relied on BSA's statements and omissions. At this stage the Court must take such statements as true, and not make credibility determinations. Whether Plaintiffs' reliance was reasonable is a question for the jury.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-117\">\n   The issue of causation is also a question of fact for the jury.\n   <em>\n    See\n   </em>\n   <em>\n    Cramer v.

The Court gives no credence to BSA's argument that the alleged statements and omissions could not have been the proximate cause of Plaintiffs' injuries because not every boy who heard those statements or relied on those omissions was sexually abused by his scoutmaster. At issue here is not whether the failure to disclose a danger of pedophiles in scouting would in every instance result in scouts being abused. Instead, the question for the jury is whether the injuries Plaintiffs alleged are \"so highly unusual that we can say, as a matter of law that a reasonable [person], making an inventory of the possibilities of harm which his conduct might produce, would not have reasonably expected the injury to occur.\"\n   <em>\n    <extracted-citation case-ids=\"4068404\" index=\"109\" url=\"https://cite.case.law/idaho/146/868/\">\n     Id.\n    </extracted-citation>\n   </em>\n   (quoting\n   <em>\n    Doe v.

Damages for Loss of Established Course of Life\n   </strong>\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-119\">\n   BSA separately moves for summary judgment on the narrow question of whether Plaintiffs are entitled to recover damages for \"loss of established course of life.\" The Court finds that Plaintiffs have not offered any factual or legal support for such damages. As such, the Court finds that Plaintiffs have waived any claim for damages for loss of established course of life, and will grant summary judgment to BSA on this issue.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-120\">\n   <strong>\n    6. Due Process and Laches\n   </strong>\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-121\">\n   Finally, BSA argues that Plaintiffs' claims are barred by laches. BSA bears the burden of proving \"(1) defendant's invasion of plaintiff's rights; (2) delay in asserting plaintiff's rights, the plaintiff having had notice and opportunity to institute a suit; (3) lack of knowledge by the defendant that plaintiff would assert his rights; and (4) injury or prejudice to the defendant.\"\n   <em>\n    Thomas v.

As such,\n   the Court finds that there is at least a question of fact as to whether Plaintiffs delayed in bringing their claims. Further, the Court finds that there is at least a question of fact as to whether BSA should have known that the Plaintiffs would assert their rights. Nonetheless, the Court is cognizant of the substantial risk of prejudice to the BSA due to the passage of time and the potential for evidentiary decay. Thus, although the Court shall deny BSA's motion, this shall not prevent BSA from raising objections on the basis of fairness and equity during future proceedings in this action.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-123\">\n   <strong>\n    7. Defendants' Affirmative Defenses\n   </strong>\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-124\">\n   Plaintiffs moved for partial summary judgment on various affirmative defenses raised by BSA and the LDS Church. The Court finds that Plaintiffs' motions are moot as to BSA's defenses as applied to Doe I, Doe II, and Doe V, and the Church Defendants' defenses as applied to Doe II, and Doe V. As to the remaining Plaintiffs, the Court will grant the motions in part, deny them in part, and find them moot in part, as follows.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-125\">\n   BSA has agreed to withdraw its first, eleventh, and sixteenth affirmative defenses as to all Plaintiffs, and its tenth affirmative defense as to all Plaintiffs other than Doe XII.\n   <em>\n    Pl.'s BSA Reply\n   </em>\n   at 2, Dkt. 303. As such, Plaintiffs' motion is moot as to these defenses.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-126\">\n   BSA's third affirmative defense and the Church Defendants' first affirmative defense both assert that the Defendants cannot be held vicariously liable for the actions of Schmidt, Arnold, and Libey.\n   <em>\n    See Pl.'s BSA Br.\n   </em>\n   at 4, Dkt. 276-1;\n   <em>\n    Pl.'s\n   </em>\n   <em>\n    LDS Br.\n   </em>\n   at 3, Dkt. 277-1.

A statement that scouting is safe when there is a foreseeable risk of sexual abuse is negligent. A statement that scouting is safe when sexual abuse has and is occurring in scouting is fraudulent. In other words, a defendant is liable under constructive fraud when the potential for injury has been substantiated at the time the statement or omission occurs. In a negligence action, however, the defendant is liable even where the potential for injury is merely foreseeable. As the Court has previously noted, the relatively \"heavy\" burden of proving fraud also underlies the application of the more lenient statute of limitations.\n    <em>\n     See Order Certifying Questions to the Idaho Supreme Court\n    </em>\n    at *7, Dkt. 69.\n   </p>\n  </footnote>\n  <footnote label=\"8\">\n   <p id=\"p-159\">\n    Plaintiffs point to statements in the Seventh, Eighth and Ninth Editions of the Boy Scout Handbook describing the scoutmaster as a \"wonderful man,\" a \"great guy,\" and a friend to whom scouts \"can always turn to for advice.\"\n    <em>\n     Adams Decl.\n    </em>\n    Ex. 17 at 8, Dkt. 285-24; Ex. 18 at 5, Dkt. 285-25; Ex. 19 at 7, Dkt. 285-26.
