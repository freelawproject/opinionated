FALLON, UNITED STATES DISTRICT JUDGE\n  </author>\n  <p id=\"p-10\">\n   Before the Court are Plaintiffs' and Defendant's Cross-Motions for Summary Judgment. R. Docs. 116 and 121. The parties have also filed in opposition. R. Docs. 120 and 130. Having considered the parties' arguments and the applicable law, the Court issues this Order &amp; Reasons.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-11\">\n   <strong>\n    I. BACKGROUND\n   </strong>\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-12\">\n   On June 27, 2017, Plaintiffs Adrian Caliste and Brian Gisclair, individually and on behalf of others similarly situated, filed this action under\n   <extracted-citation index=\"0\" url=\"https://cite.case.law/citations/?q=42%20U.S.C.%20%C2%A7%201983\">\n    42 U.S.C. \u00a7 1983\n   </extracted-citation>\n   against Orleans Parish Criminal District Magistrate Judge Harry E. Cantrell, alleging violations of their rights under the Fourteenth Amendment's Due Process and Equal Protection Clauses. R. Doc. 1 at 25. Plaintiffs are former criminal defendants who were in the custody of the Orleans Parish Sheriff's Office at the time the complaint was filed. R. Doc. 1 at 2-3. Defendant Cantrell is the Magistrate Judge for Orleans Parish Criminal District Court (\"OPCDC\"), where he is responsible for setting bail upon arrest and has a role in managing the expenditures of the Judicial Expense Fund. R. Doc. 1 at 3.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-13\">\n   In Count One, Plaintiffs allege that Judge Cantrell routinely sets a $2,500 minimum secured money bond without first considering the facts of the case to determine whether a lower bond amount or an alternative condition of release might be appropriate. R. Doc. 1 at 6. Plaintiffs further aver that Judge Cantrell requires the use of a bail bond from a commercial (for-profit) surety and does not allow arrestees to post cash bail. R. Doc. 1 at 2. In Count Two, Plaintiffs contend that Judge Cantrell has a conflict of interest because under Louisiana law, 1.8% of a bond amount collected from a commercial surety is allocated directly to the Court for its discretionary use. R. Doc. 1 at 2.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-14\">\n   Plaintiffs moved to certify a class of similarly situated plaintiffs. R. Doc. 5. On March 16, 2018, the Court granted this motion and certified the class. R. Doc. 99. Plaintiffs now seek a declaratory judgement that Judge Cantrell's bond policy, which they assert results in the creation of a modern \"debtor's prison,\" and financial\n   conflict of interest are violations of Plaintiffs' constitutional rights. R. Doc. 1 at 26. Defendant, Judge Cantrell, denies Plaintiffs' allegations and seeks summary judgment dismissing Plaintiffs' complaint.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-15\">\n   <strong>\n    II. PRESENT MOTIONS\n   </strong>\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-16\">\n   <strong>\n    A. Plaintiffs' Motion for Summary Judgment (R. Doc. 116)\n   </strong>\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-17\">\n   Plaintiffs have filed a Motion for Summary Judgment. R. Doc. 116. The Plaintiff Class seeks declaratory judgment on both of their claims. R. Doc. 116-1 at 4. First, Plaintiffs' argue that Judge Cantrell violates their Equal Protection and Due Process rights by jailing Plaintiffs when they are unable to pay set bonds. R. Doc. 116-1 at 5. Plaintiffs argue that Judge Cantrell's practice violates their rights against wealth-based detention and fundamental right to pretrial liberty because he sets bail without making findings that pretrial detention is necessary or making an inquiry into Plaintiffs' ability to pay. R. Doc. 116-1 at 6, 12, 26. Second, Plaintiffs argue that since Judge Cantrell shares executive control over funds that come partly from fees on the commercial surety bonds that he sets, he has a conflict of interest in the process of setting those bonds. R. Doc. 116-1 at 33. Plaintiffs allege that this conflict violates their due process right to a neutral and detached judge. R. Doc. 116-1 at 29. For these reasons, Plaintiffs move for summary judgment. R. Doc. 116-1 at 34.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-18\">\n   Defendant responds in opposition. R. Doc. 120. First, Judge Cantrell argues that this Court lacks the power to direct him in the performance of his duties. R. Doc. 120 at 1. Judge Cantrell argues that Plaintiffs have asked this Court to order him to follow certain protocols when he conducts bail hearings and that this Court lacks the power to direct him in this manner. R. Doc. 120 at 3. Second, regarding Plaintiffs' request for declaratory relief, Judge Cantrell argues that any such relief would be advisory because there is no justiciable controversy. R. Doc. 120 at 5. Judge Cantrell further argues that Plaintiffs' claims regarding his bail hearing protocol are moot because since this lawsuit he has in good faith changed his bail hearing procedures. R. Doc. 120 at 6. Understanding his heavy burden in proving mootness, Judge Cantrell has attached an affidavit describing his new colloquy and checklist used during bail hearings. R. Doc. 120-1.\n   <footnotemark>\n    1\n   </footnotemark>\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-19\">\n   Third, Judge Cantrell argues that the procedures regarding management of the Judicial Expense Fund do not negate a fair tribunal because 1) the OPCDC can go to the state or parish if it needs more funds, 2) there is no quota or reward for adding to the fund, and 3) the judges have no personal interest in the money collected. R. Doc. 120 at 9-11. Additionally, Judge Cantrell argues that he benefits from a presumption of integrity and if this procedure makes him biased than all courts are biased because all collect fees from defendants in some way. R. Doc. 120 at 13. Finally, Judge Cantrell also argues that the fees incurred under Louisiana's bail bond statutes do not create an impermissible bias because the Fifth Circuit has held that such fees are reasonable administrative fees. R. Doc. 120 at 18.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-20\">\n   <strong>\n    B. Defendant's Motion for Summary Judgment (R. Doc. 121)\n   </strong>\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-21\">\n   In support of his motion for summary judgment, Defendant has submitted a\n   memorandum identical to that submitted in response to Plaintiffs' motion for summary judgment. R. Doc. 121-1. In opposition, Plaintiffs have submitted a memorandum identical to that submitted in reply supporting their own motion. R. Doc. 130.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-22\">\n   <strong>\n    III. LAW AND ANALYSIS\n   </strong>\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-23\">\n   The present motions raise questions of justiciability, the constitutionality of Judge Cantrell's bail procedures, and his conflict of interest when he has both judicial and executive power regarding revenues of the Judicial Executive Fund. The Court acknowledges the similarities between this case and\n   <em>\n    Cain v. City of New Orleans\n   </em>\n   ,\n   <extracted-citation case-ids=\"12277934\" index=\"1\" url=\"https://cite.case.law/f-supp-3d/281/624/\">\n    281 F.Supp.3d 624\n   </extracted-citation>\n   (E.D.

Furthermore, a court must assess the evidence, review the facts and draw any appropriate inferences based on the evidence in the light most favorable to the party opposing summary judgment.\n   <em>\n    See\n   </em>\n   <em>\n    Daniels v. City of Arlington, Tex.\n   </em>\n   ,\n   <extracted-citation case-ids=\"11108992\" index=\"16\" url=\"https://cite.case.law/f3d/246/500/#p502\">\n    246 F.3d 500\n   </extracted-citation>\n   , 502 (5th Cir. 2001) ;\n   <em>\n    Reid v.

With these legal principles in mind, the Court turns to the parties motion which will be discussed in turn.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-27\">\n   <strong>\n    B. Justiciability\n   </strong>\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-28\">\n   Defendant Cantrell's motion for summary judgment raises several justiciability questions. First, Judge Cantrell argues that the claims in Count One are moot due to his voluntary cessation of the challenged bail procedures. Second, Judge Cantrell argues that Plaintiffs improperly seek a writ of mandamus compelling the actions of a state official. Finally, Judge Cantrell argues that the Court should abstain from granting declaratory relief in this case.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-29\">\n   The Court will discuss each argument in turn.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-30\">\n   <strong>\n    i. Mootness\n   </strong>\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-31\">\n   The Constitution limits the jurisdiction of federal courts to cases or controversies. U.S. Const. art. III, \u00a7 2. To satisfy this requirement, a plaintiff must have a personal interest in the case, not only at the outset, but at \"all stages\" of the lawsuit.\n   <em>\n    Davis v. Fed.

R. Doc. 44 at 5-6. In this motion, Judge Cantrell argues that Plaintiffs have lost this personal interest and their claims are now moot. Judge Cantrell argues that since this lawsuit he intends to cease the allegedly unconstitutional bail procedures thus mooting Count One.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-33\">\n   \"Generally, any set of circumstances that eliminates actual controversy after the commencement of a lawsuit renders that action moot.\"\n   <em>\n    Ctr. for Individual Freedom v.

Accordingly, the Court has closely examined Defendant's claims and is not satisfied that the voluntary conduct has mooted Plaintiffs' claims regarding the alleged bail practices.

Judge Cantrell has submitted no evidence of the implementation of these new bail procedures. These changes were made only after this litigation was commenced and Judge Cantrell's affidavit is not binding on his future procedures. For these reasons, the Court finds that Judge Cantrell has not met his heavy burden of convincing the Court that the challenged bail procedures could not reasonably be expected to recur.

Plaintiffs have filed a \u00a7 1983 claim requesting declaratory relief recognizing their Constitutional rights. None of the above factors apply to this situation or suggest that this suit would be \"better settled in state court.\"\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-66\">\n   Accordingly, the Court finds that the matters before it are justiciable and finds no reason to abstain from ruling. The Court now moves to a consideration of the Plaintiffs' substantive arguments seeking summary judgment.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-67\">\n   <strong>\n    C. Count One: Judge Cantrell's Bail Procedures\n   </strong>\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-68\">\n   In Count One, Plaintiffs' main argument is that Judge Cantrell's bail procedures violate their constitutional rights because he imprisons criminal defendants solely based on their inability to pay the set bail. Plaintiffs specifically challenge Defendant's practice of setting bail without considering alternative conditions of release or ability to pay.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-69\">\n   The facts regarding Judge Cantrell's bail procedures are undisputed. R. Docs. 121-6, 121-7. Judge Cantrell agrees that the following are standard practices for setting bail in his court:\n  </p>\n  <blockquote id=\"p-70\">\n   \u2022 Introduction and overview of bail setting process.\n  </blockquote>\n  <blockquote id=\"p-71\">\n   \u2022 Qualification of defendants for public defender services, including questions regarding employment, income, and dependents.\n  </blockquote>\n  <blockquote id=\"p-72\">\n   \u2022 Time for defendants to meet with their attorneys.\n  </blockquote>\n  <blockquote id=\"p-73\">\n   \u2022 Judge Cantrell uses the background information provided by the public defender to determine the conditions of release or detention; \"he does not ask additional questions.\"\n  </blockquote>\n  <blockquote id=\"p-74\">\n   \u2022 Judge \"Cantrell has told public defenders that he would hold them in contempt when they have attempted to argue for lower bond amounts or RORs for their clients.\"\n  </blockquote>\n  <blockquote id=\"p-75\">\n   \u2022 Judge \"Cantrell does not determine whether the financial condition of release that he imposes will result in pretrial detention.\"\n  </blockquote>\n  <p id=\"p-76\">\n   R. Doc. 121-7 at 3-6.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-77\">\n   It is clear that under these procedures Judge Cantrell does not request much financial information from criminal defendants prior to determining the amount of their bail. Nor does he \"consider or make findings concerning alternative conditions of release when he requires secured financial conditions, and does not make any findings that pretrial detention is necessary to serve any particular government interest if a secured financial condition will result in detention.\" R. Doc. 121-7 at 6-7. Transcript evidence in the record confirms these facts. R. Docs. 121-7. Plaintiffs in this case were imprisoned prior to trial because they were unable to pay the set bail. Transcripts from their bail hearings demonstrate that Judge Cantrell did not inquire regarding their ability to post bail, nor did he provide reasoning for his rejection of alternative conditions of release.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-78\">\n   As an example, Ms. Mishana Johnson was detained prior to trial on a charge of simple battery. R. Doc. 121-7 at 4. Judge Cantrell appointed a public defender to represent Ms. Johnson after learning that she did not have counsel and worked at McDonald's. R. Doc. 121-7 at 4. Her appointed counsel requested $1000 bail based on employment status and lack of risk factors. R. Doc. 121-7 at 4. Judge Cantrell set bail at $5000 without inquiry into Ms. Johnson's ability to pay and informed the public defender that he does not set bail lower than $2500. R. Doc. 121-7 at 5. Judge Cantrell later reprimanded another public defender for requesting release on recognizance (\"ROR\") or a $1000 bond. R. Doc. 121-7 at 5. The attorney argued that his client was employed in a low-wage job and was a college student. R. Doc. 121-7 at 5. Judge Cantrell again set a $5000 bond without inquiry into the defendant's ability to pay or providing reasoning for his rejection of alternative conditions of release. R. Doc. 121-7 at 5.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-79\">\n   More disturbing is the colloquy regarding bail set for Ms. Ashley Jackson on June 12, 2017. R. Doc. 121-7 at 5. Judge Cantrell had agreed to an ROR for this defendant until he realized that her listed address was a homeless shelter. R. Doc. 121-7 at 5. Subsequently, stating his concerns regarding the court's ability to contact Ms. Jackson, he set a secured $2500 bond. R. Doc. 121-7 at 5. After argument with defense counsel, Judge Cantrell stated that he was \"not punishing [the defendant] for being poor [but that he was] punishing her because [the court could] not get in touch with her.\" R. Doc. 121-7 at 6.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-80\">\n   This evidence suggests that Judge Cantrell regularly sets bail without considering the defendant's ability pay or qualification for alternative conditions of release and that these practices regularly result in pretrial detention based on inability to pay bail. Judge Cantrell has not argued that these descriptions of his practices are inaccurate\n   and has made no substantive constitutional arguments in defense of these practices.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-81\">\n   Plaintiffs argue that these practices violate their due process and equal protection rights under the Fourteenth Amendment.

Preliminary hearings can be complex and difficult to navigate for lay individuals and many, following arrest, lack access to other resources that would allow them to present their best case. Considering the already established vital importance of pretrial liberty, assistance of counsel is of the utmost value at a bail hearing.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-104\">\n   Judge Cantrell does not argue this point. In fact, the record shows that public defenders are regularly provided for those individuals found to be indigent at their initial appearance before Judge Cantrell. The Court commends this practice and encourages its continuance. Beyond this encouragement, the Court finds that the right to counsel at a bail hearing to determine pretrial detention is also required by due process. The interests of the government are mixed regarding provision of counsel at this stage. It is certainly a financial burden on the state to provide attorneys for the indigent. However, this burden is outweighed not only by the individual's great interest in the accuracy of the outcome of the hearing, but also by the government's interest in that accuracy and the financial burden that may be lifted by releasing those arrestees who do not require pretrial detention. Accordingly, the\n   <em>\n    Mathews\n   </em>\n   test demonstrates that due process requires representative counsel at pretrial detention hearings.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-105\">\n   As discussed above, the record indicates that Judge Cantrell's bail procedures have not provided notice of the importance of the issue of the criminal defendant's ability to pay, inquiry into the ability to pay, findings on the record regarding ability to pay and consideration of alternative conditions of release, or application of a legal standard in the determination of the necessity of pretrial detention. Accordingly, these procedures violate Plaintiffs' procedural due process rights; Plaintiffs' are entitled to summary judgment on Count One and it is appropriate to grant Plaintiffs' motion for declaratory judgment.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-106\">\n   The Court commends Judge Cantrell's expressed willingness to mend the bail procedures in his court to comply with due process requirements.

Plaintiffs challenge Judge Cantrell's multipurpose role in determining their ability to pay bail, the amount of bail upon which pretrial release is conditioned, and managing the Judicial Expense Fund, a portion of which comes from fees levied on commercial surety bonds. Plaintiffs argue that Judge Cantrell's management role over this fund creates an unconstitutional conflict of interest that deprives them of their right to a neutral fact finder in pretrial detention hearings.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-112\">\n   <strong>\n    i.

In\n   <em>\n    Cain\n   </em>\n   , the Court found that a similar percentage of the\n   Fund was enough to make the judges' conflict of interest substantial.\n   <em>\n    Id.\n   </em>\n   at 657-58 (\"Fines and fees revenue is obviously important to the Judges; fines and fees provide approximately 10% of the total OPCDC budget and one quarter of the Judicial Expense Fund.\").\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-131\">\n   As explained by the Court in\n   <em>\n    Cain\n   </em>\n   , this conflict of interest is not created by Judge Cantrell, nor is it his fault. The conflict of interest is \"the unfortunate result of the financing structure\" and lack of sufficient funding from the state and local governments for the criminal justice system.\n   <em>\n    Id.\n   </em>\n   at 658. However, the source of the conflict does not change the fact that as long as Judge Cantrell participates in the control of bond fee revenue and the OPCDC relies on it as a substantial source of funding, Judge Cantrell's determination of Plaintiffs' ability to pay bail and the amount of that bail is in violation of due process.\n   <em>\n    See id.\n   </em>\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-132\">\n   Defendant makes several arguments that his dual role in setting bail and administering the Fund do not offend due process requirements. The Court will consider each in turn.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-133\">\n   First, Judge Cantrell argues that the Fund system does not create a conflict of interest because if the OPCDC needs additional funds it can request them from the state legislature or local parish government. R. Doc. 120 at 9. The Court approaches this claim with some incredulity. Given the substantial percentage of the Fund coming from bond fees, the Court finds it implausible that these revenues would be easily replaced by solicitation of state and local officials. Furthermore, OPCDC officials themselves have noted the significance of this amount of revenue and its sources to the Fund.\n   <em>\n    See\n   </em>\n   <em>\n    Cain\n   </em>\n   ,\n   <extracted-citation case-ids=\"12277934\" index=\"230\" url=\"https://cite.case.law/f-supp-3d/281/624/\">\n    281 F.Supp.3d at 658\n   </extracted-citation>\n   .\n   <footnotemark>\n    11\n   </footnotemark>\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-134\">\n   Second, Judge Cantrell argues that the revenues in the Fund are publically audited and used appropriately. The Court finds this fact irrelevant to the issues before it as Plaintiffs are not arguing that the use of the revenues violates their constitutional rights, but rather that the determination of those revenues and control over them by the same individual is the problem.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-135\">\n   Third, Judge Cantrell argues that he is not subjected to a quota, receives no rewards based on amount of revenue collected, and has no personal interest in the Fund. The Court finds that it is not necessary for Judge Cantrell to have a quota, punishment, or reward associated with the Fund in order to have a conflict of interest. The significance of these funds for the payment of personnel salaries and other administrative needs, approximately $250,000 per chambers, is sufficient incentive to act as a \"possible temptation\" to the \"average man.\" Additionally, \"[t]hat [Judge Cantrell] ha[s] an institutional, rather than direct and individual, interest in maximizing [bond fee] revenue is immaterial.\"\n   <em>\n    Cain\n   </em>\n   ,\n   <extracted-citation case-ids=\"12277934\" index=\"231\" url=\"https://cite.case.law/f-supp-3d/281/624/\">\n    281 F.Supp.3d at 656\n   </extracted-citation>\n   . \"\n   <em>\n    Ward\n   </em>\n   itself involved a mayor who had no direct, personal interest in traffic fine revenue; his interest related solely to his 'executive responsibilities for village finances.'\n   <extracted-citation case-ids=\"6171363\" index=\"232\" url=\"https://cite.case.law/us/409/57/#p58\">\n    409 U.S. at 60\n   </extracted-citation>\n   ,\n   <extracted-citation case-ids=\"6171363\" index=\"233\" url=\"https://cite.case.law/us/409/57/#p58\">\n    93 S.Ct. 80\n   </extracted-citation>\n   .

Defendant misses the point here because the problem is not specifically with the fact that the court is partially funded by fees from criminal defendants and those that utilize the court system. Rather the problem lies with the inherent temptation and conflict of interest when the same official is determining ability to pay bail, and the amount of that bail, and also managing the funds collected from fees on that bail.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-137\">\n   Fifth, Judge Cantrell argues that Plaintiffs cannot overcome the \"presumption of honesty and integrity of judges.\" R.

However, in\n   <em>\n    Brown v.

That added burden comes from\n   <em>\n    Withrow v. Larkin\n   </em>\n   , 1975,\n   <extracted-citation case-ids=\"541084\" index=\"236\" url=\"https://cite.case.law/us/421/35/#p47\">\n    421 U.S. 35\n   </extracted-citation>\n   ,\n   <extracted-citation case-ids=\"541084\" index=\"237\" url=\"https://cite.case.law/us/421/35/#p47\">\n    95 S.Ct. 1456\n   </extracted-citation>\n   ,\n   <extracted-citation case-ids=\"541084\" index=\"238\" url=\"https://cite.case.law/us/421/35/#p47\">\n    43 L.Ed.2d 712\n   </extracted-citation>\n   , upon which the district court and the defendant strongly relied. But the question in\n   <em>\n    Withrow\n   </em>\n   was whether a board of physicians could exercise both investigative and adjudicative functions.\n  </blockquote>\n  <p id=\"p-139\">\n   <em>\n    <extracted-citation case-ids=\"541084\" index=\"239\" url=\"https://cite.case.law/us/421/35/#p47\">\n     Id.\n    </extracted-citation>\n   </em>\n   Likewise, the case cited by Judge Cantrell involved the potential bias of a school board rather than a judge.\n   <em>\n    Valley\n   </em>\n   ,\n   <extracted-citation case-ids=\"509057\" index=\"240\" url=\"https://cite.case.law/f3d/118/1047/#p1052\">\n    118 F.3d at 1049\n   </extracted-citation>\n   . Accordingly, the proper standard has been stated above, that the interest under\n   <em>\n    Tumey\n   </em>\n   and\n   <em>\n    Ward\n   </em>\n   is not the actual bias or integrity of an individual judge, but rather \"the vulnerability of the average man-as the system works in practice and as it appears to defendants and to the public [and] the possibility that judges will fail to hold 'the balance nice, clear and true.' \"\n   <em>\n    Brown\n   </em>\n   ,\n   <extracted-citation case-ids=\"1353860\" index=\"241\" url=\"https://cite.case.law/f2d/637/272/#p274\">\n    637 F.2d at 284\n   </extracted-citation>\n   . Furthermore, it is not only important that justice be done; it is equally important that justice appear to be done. The appearance of justice is vital to perpetuation of the rule of law, a concept upon which our society is based.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-140\">\n   Finally, Judge Cantrell raises\n   <em>\n    Broussard v. Parish of Orleans\n   </em>\n   arguing that the bail bond statutes do not create an unconstitutional bias. The Court has previously addressed the relevance of\n   <em>\n    Broussard\n   </em>\n   in the proper party defendant context. R. Doc. 81 at 6. The Court again finds that\n   <em>\n    Broussard\n   </em>\n   is not relevant to the issue of judicial conflict of interest in this case. In\n   <em>\n    Broussard\n   </em>\n   the plaintiffs challenged the constitutionality of Louisiana bail statutes rather than alleging bias of individual judicial officers.\n   <extracted-citation case-ids=\"9337822\" index=\"242\" url=\"https://cite.case.law/f3d/318/644/#p647\">\n    318 F.3d 644\n   </extracted-citation>\n   , 647 (5th Cir. 2003). There, the Fifth Circuit affirmed the district court finding that\n   <em>\n    Tumey\n   </em>\n   and\n   <em>\n    Ward\n   </em>\n   did not apply because the defendants, sheriffs, were not exercising a judicial function.\n   <em>\n    <extracted-citation case-ids=\"9337822\" index=\"243\" url=\"https://cite.case.law/f3d/318/644/#p647\">\n     Id.\n    </extracted-citation>\n   </em>\n   <extracted-citation case-ids=\"9337822\" index=\"243\" url=\"https://cite.case.law/f3d/318/644/#p647\">\n    at 662\n   </extracted-citation>\n   . In contrast, Judge Cantrell does exercise a judicial function when he, sitting as Magistrate Judge, determines Plaintiffs' ability to pay bail and the amount of that bail. Therefore, it is appropriate to apply the\n   <em>\n    Tumey\n   </em>\n   and\n   <em>\n    Ward\n   </em>\n   tests here when determining whether there is an unconstitutional conflict of interest.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-141\">\n   The Court finds none of these arguments persuasive, and finds that Plaintiffs have succeeded in demonstrating that Judge Cantrell's participation in the management of the Fund in conjunction with his determination of Plaintiffs' ability to pay bail and the amount of that bail is a substantial conflict of interest that produces a \"possible temptation ... not to hold the balance nice, clear, and true between the state and the accused.\"\n   <em>\n    Ward\n   </em>\n   ,\n   <extracted-citation case-ids=\"6171363\" index=\"244\" url=\"https://cite.case.law/us/409/57/#p58\">\n    409 U.S. at 60\n   </extracted-citation>\n   ,\n   <extracted-citation case-ids=\"6171363\" index=\"245\" url=\"https://cite.case.law/us/409/57/#p58\">\n    93 S.Ct. 80\n   </extracted-citation>\n   (quoting\n   <em>\n    Tumey\n   </em>\n   ,\n   <extracted-citation case-ids=\"6142780\" index=\"246\" url=\"https://cite.case.law/us/273/510/#p535\">\n    273 U.S. at 532\n   </extracted-citation>\n   ,\n   <extracted-citation case-ids=\"6142780\" index=\"247\" url=\"https://cite.case.law/us/273/510/#p535\">\n    47 S.Ct. 437\n   </extracted-citation>\n   ). Accordingly,\n   Plaintiffs are entitled to summary judgment on Count Two and are entitled to a declaratory judgment that Judge Cantrell's institutional incentives create a substantial and unconstitutional conflict of interest when he determines their ability to pay bail and sets the amount of that bail.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-142\">\n   <strong>\n    IV.
