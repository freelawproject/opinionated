This is the Aminas' third action filed in this district court concerning this mortgage transaction. Defendants seek dismissal of the Aminas' claims under the doctrines of claim and issue preclusion or, alternatively, for failure to state a claim. Because the requirements of claim and issue preclusion have been met, and because Plaintiffs' claims are additionally time-barred or fail to state a claim, the Court GRANTS Defendants' Motions. Plaintiffs are granted limited leave to amend claims that are not precluded or time-barred, with instructions below.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-12\">\n   <strong>\n    <em>\n     BACKGROUND\n    </em>\n   </strong>\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-13\">\n   The Aminas bring claims against JPMorgan Chase Bank, N.A.

Chase and MERS filed a Motion to Dismiss, Dkt. No. 14, and NTC filed a substantive joinder in that Motion, Dkt. No. 26.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-14\">\n   In light of the substantial record of litigation involving the Aminas' property and\n   subject loans, the Court first recounts the earlier lawsuits between the parties, before addressing the present claims.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-15\">\n   <strong>\n    I.\n    <em>\n     Prior Lawsuits\n    </em>\n   </strong>\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-16\">\n   The Aminas' claims relate to the same Mortgage on their real property, located at 2304 Metcalf Street # 2, Honolulu, Hawaii 96822 (\"Property\") that is at issue in a pending foreclosure proceeding\n   <footnotemark>\n    3\n   </footnotemark>\n   and in two prior matters in this district court that were decided in defendants' favor.\n   <footnotemark>\n    4\n   </footnotemark>\n   <em>\n    See\n   </em>\n   Compl. \u00b6 203, Dkt.

The Aminas' claims arose from a mortgage transaction backing two loans from WMC-one for $880,000, and another for $220,000-and a threatened foreclosure of the Property located at 2304 Metcalf Street # 2, Honolulu, Hawaii 96822.\n   <em>\n    See\n   </em>\n   <em>\n    Amina\n   </em>\n   ,\n   <extracted-citation index=\"0\" url=\"https://cite.case.law/citations/?q=2011%20WL%201869835\">\n    2011 WL 1869835\n   </extracted-citation>\n   , at *1 (D.

Haw. Jan. 7, 2015). The district court's order granting defendants' motion for summary judgment found both that the Mortgage was validly transferred to U.S. Bank and also that the Aminas were not entitled to quiet title. The district court explained the Mortgage transactions at issue in the litigation:\n  </p>\n  <blockquote id=\"p-27\">\n   Throughout the pendency of both the First Action and this action, there was no dispute that Plaintiff entered into two mortgage loans on the subject property with WMC in 2006. (The mortgage loan for $220,000 has been released, leaving the one for $880,000 at issue.) Indeed, the Complaint in the First Action (which included WMC as a Defendant) recited that Plaintiffs entered into these two mortgage loans with WMC, and asserted claims based upon alleged improprieties by WMC and WMC's loan documents.\n   <em>\n    See\n   </em>\n   Civ. No. 10-00165 JMS-KSC, Doc. No. 1, Compl. \u00b6\u00b6 38-81.

Turning to the merits of the claims, the district court determined that \"U.S. Bank is the mortgagee on the mortgage loan on the subject property,\" based upon the following evidence in the summary judgment record:\n  </p>\n  <blockquote id=\"p-29\">\n   Defendants have presented evidence that in June 2006, Plaintiffs' mortgage loan was transferred to JP Morgan Trust pursuant to the PSA, as is shown in the Mortgage Loan Schedule for the JP Morgan Trust listing Plaintiffs' mortgage loan.\n   <em>\n    See\n   </em>\n   Doc.

Plaintiffs' $880,000 mortgage loan is identified in the Loan Schedule by the Loan ID number ****1019, which also appears on the upper left-hand corner of the note and mortgage. Doc. No. 141-1, Alegria Decl. \u00b6 6;\n   <em>\n    see also\n   </em>\n   Doc. No. 158, Defs.' Ex. E at 1, 43; Doc. No. 142-1, Defs.' Ex. C (Balloon Note for $880,000); Doc. No. 141-5, Defs.' Ex. B (mortgage on subject property referring to Balloon Note for $880,000). Further, on April 4, 2012, an assignment of mortgage from MERS, as nominee for WMC, its successors, and assigns, to U.S. Bank (again, as trustee for the JP Morgan Trust), was recorded in the Hawaii Bureau of Conveyances.\n   <em>\n    See\n   </em>\n   Doc. No. 142-4, Defs.' Ex. F. Finally, Defendants present a copy of the Note, endorsed in blank, and Alegria asserts that JP Morgan Chase has possession of it. Doc. No. 141-1, Alegria Decl. \u00b6 4; Doc.

Moreover, Plaintiffs' statutory and regulatory claims previously raised in the First Lawsuit are likewise barred. As discussed below, claim preclusion is applicable because there is: (1) an identity of claims; (2) a final judgment on the merits from a previous lawsuit; and (3) privity between the previous defendants and the Defendants in this case. Only unrelated claims that were not and could not have been raised in the prior litigation are excluded from this bar. Claims arising from separate, unrelated violations, or which could not have been raised in the prior litigation are not precluded based upon the current record before the Court.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-74\">\n   <strong>\n    1.\n    <em>\n     Identity of Claims\n    </em>\n   </strong>\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-75\">\n   Each of the relevant factors weighs in favor of a finding that this case and the two prior cases, in large part, involve the same claims, with minimal exceptions. Certain claims in the current action\n   are clearly identical to prior claims and are based on the same factual predicates. Several newly labeled or reformulated claims have simply repackaged the Aminas' prior attack on the validity of the Assignment.\n   <footnotemark>\n    8\n   </footnotemark>\n   The Court briefly addresses each cause of action in the current Complaint, identifying any portions thereof that are not precluded by the First and Second Lawsuits, in order to provide clarity to Plaintiffs in the filing of any amended complaint.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-76\">\n   Plaintiffs' first cause of action to quiet title to the Property was raised before and adjudicated by the district court in the Second Lawsuit. Plaintiffs' current claim asserts that there \"are no valid mortgages on the property,\" Compl. \u00b6 391, because of the false and invalid Assignment of Mortgage,\n   <em>\n    id.\n   </em>\n   \u00b6\u00b6 27-59, and seeks to quiet title \"against parties which ... are not owner and holder of any Note,\"\n   <em>\n    id.\n   </em>\n   \u00b6 48. The district court found that the Aminas did, in fact, \"enter[ ] into the mortgage loans on the subject property with WMC,\"\n   <extracted-citation index=\"75\" url=\"https://cite.case.law/citations/?q=2015%20WL%2084760\">\n    2015 WL 84760\n   </extracted-citation>\n   , at *6, and that the April 4, 2012 Assignment was valid,\n   <em>\n    id.\n   </em>\n   at *8.\n   <footnotemark>\n    9\n   </footnotemark>\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-77\">\n   In response, the Aminas argue that their present quiet title claim, and any claim based upon the allegedly invalid Assignment, cannot be the \"same\" as their earlier claims because they could not have raised the current claims in the earlier litigation. Plaintiffs are mistaken. Not only\n   <em>\n    could\n   </em>\n   they have raised the current claim-they did. In the Second Lawsuit, the Aminas filed their original complaint on November 28, 2011, their First Amended Complaint on June 5, 2012, and their Second Amended Complaint against U.S. Bank on October\n   19, 2012. The Aminas' argument that they could not have brought their claims based upon the April 4, 2012 Assignment in the Second Lawsuit is factually and legally without merit.\n   <footnotemark>\n    10\n   </footnotemark>\n   <em>\n    See\n   </em>\n   Mem. in Opp'n at 2-3, Dkt.

The current quiet title claim unquestionably arises out of the same transaction as the claims previously adjudicated in the Second Lawsuit against these Defendants.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-78\">\n   Plaintiffs' second cause of action for violation of the FDCPA,\n   <extracted-citation index=\"76\" url=\"https://cite.case.law/citations/?q=15%20U.S.C.%20%C2%A7%201692\">\n    15 U.S.C. \u00a7 1692\n   </extracted-citation>\n   <em>\n    et seq.\n   </em>\n   , alleges that the Chase Defendants failed to respond to a November 7, 2017 written \"request for verification and validation,\" Compl. \u00b6 400, and did not \"validate the alleged debt within 30 days,\"\n   <em>\n    <extracted-citation index=\"77\" url=\"https://cite.case.law/citations/?q=15%20U.S.C.%20%C2%A7%201692\">\n     id.\n    </extracted-citation>\n   </em>\n   <extracted-citation index=\"77\" url=\"https://cite.case.law/citations/?q=15%20U.S.C.%20%C2%A7%201692\">\n    \u00b6 402\n   </extracted-citation>\n   . Although the Aminas allege that they sent a new letter under the FDCPA to the Chase Defendants on November 7, 2017, the district court, in the First Lawsuit, dismissed their prior FDCPA claim against Chase.\n   <footnotemark>\n    11\n   </footnotemark>\n   It appears to the Court that the Aminas have simply sent additional written requests to Chase, seeking the same relief under the FDCPA, and thereafter alleged a violation of the FDCPA purportedly triggered by the successive written requests. Insofar as Plaintiffs raise the FDCPA anew, predicated on the same underlying debt verification correspondence-and on the very same Mortgage account, to the same servicer-those claims arise out of the same underlying transactional nucleus of facts. To the extent the FDCPA claim in the present matter arises from a separate violation of the FDCPA, untethered to the prior claim and which could not have been alleged in the earlier litigation, it is not entirely barred. Accordingly, the Court does not find, for present purposes, that this FDCPA claim is wholly precluded.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-79\">\n   Similarly, Plaintiffs' third cause of action against the Chase Defendants for violation of RESPA,\n   <extracted-citation index=\"78\" url=\"https://cite.case.law/citations/?q=12%20U.S.C.%20%C2%A7%202601\">\n    12 U.S.C. \u00a7 2601\n   </extracted-citation>\n   <em>\n    et seq.\n   </em>\n   , relies upon a November 7, 2017 qualified written request (\"QWR\") seeking documents and details regarding their account. Compl. \u00b6\u00b6 407-409. A similar RESPA claim was dismissed in the First Lawsuit, based upon prior QWRs sent to\n   Chase and WMC.\n   <em>\n    See\n   </em>\n   <extracted-citation index=\"79\" url=\"https://cite.case.law/citations/?q=2011%20WL%203841001\">\n    2011 WL 3841001\n   </extracted-citation>\n   , at *6 ;\n   <extracted-citation index=\"80\" url=\"https://cite.case.law/citations/?q=2012%20WL%20612463\">\n    2012 WL 612463\n   </extracted-citation>\n   (dismissed with prejudice). To the extent the current RESPA claim arises from a separate, unrelated violation of the statute and which could not have been alleged in the earlier litigation, it is likely not barred. Accordingly, the Court does not find, for present purposes, that the RESPA claim is completely precluded.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-80\">\n   In their fifth cause of action, Plaintiffs allege a UDAP violation based upon two separate acts alleged to be unfair and deceptive: (1) the \"recording of the forged Assignment of Mortgage,\" Compl. \u00b6 424, and (2) the \"mailing of important letters under the pseudonym 'CHASE,' \"\n   <em>\n    id.\n   </em>\n   \u00b6 425. The first alleged act arises out of the same series of transactional facts previously addressed in the Second Lawsuit regarding the validity of the Assignment. The second series of acts relating to mailings from Chase appear to refer to an October 16, 2017 statement received from \"Chase,\" Compl. \u00b6 352, which Plaintiffs allege misstated \"the amounts and also misrepresented who was entitled to enforce a promissory note.\" Compl. \u00b6 352. In response to Plaintiffs' November 7, 2017 letter, \"Chase\" sent, on November 20, 2017, a letter indicating the request was pending, and then \"Chase\" mailed another letter on December 11, 2017, stating it needed more time to respond to the request. Compl. \u00b6\u00b6 355-357. To the extent this series of correspondence in 2017 serves as the basis for their UDAP claim, it is not precluded by the prior litigation. However, as addressed below, it fails to state a claim for violation of HRS \u00a7 480-2.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-81\">\n   The TILA violation alleged in the seventh cause of action is based upon the failure of the Chase Defendants to notify Plaintiffs, within 30 days of the transfer, that \"after May 20, 2009, someone sold or otherwise transferred or assigned to all Chase Defendants,\" the Mortgage on the Property. Compl. \u00b6\u00b6 447, 452. In the First Lawsuit, the district court dismissed Plaintiffs' TILA claims for rescission and damages.\n   <extracted-citation index=\"81\" url=\"https://cite.case.law/citations/?q=2011%20WL%203841001\">\n    2011 WL 3841001\n   </extracted-citation>\n   , at *5 ;\n   <extracted-citation index=\"82\" url=\"https://cite.case.law/citations/?q=2011%20WL%201869835\">\n    2011 WL 1869835\n   </extracted-citation>\n   , at *6. Insofar as the present claim is not related to the prior TILA claims involving loan origination and servicing disclosures, it is not precluded by the earlier lawsuits. However, as addressed below, the claim is time-barred as a matter of law.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-82\">\n   Finally, although they seek remedies and do not amount to stand-alone claims, the Aminas' fourth cause of action for an accounting, sixth cause of action seeking relief from judgment under Rule 60, and eighth cause of action for declaratory relief either raise the same claims as earlier litigation, or simply seek to collaterally attack the results of prior litigation. Because they arise out of the same set of events, or could have been brought in the prior cases, these causes of action satisfy the identity of claims factor.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-83\">\n   In sum, the Aminas' claims (with the noted exceptions) are based largely on the same transactional nucleus of facts, and there is no reason they could not have been raised in the First or Second Lawsuits. Indeed, in some cases, they were. Consequently, Defendants have satisfied the identity of claims element of\n   <em>\n    res judicata\n   </em>\n   with respect to the Aminas' claims-regardless of their label-challenging the Assignment or validity of the Mortgage, including the quiet title claim. Insofar as the Complaint asserts new causes of action that are not based upon the same transactional nucleus of facts as those raised in the First and Second Lawsuits-including those claims or portions of claims based upon communications in late 2017-Defendants have not satisfied this element, and those claims are not precluded by the prior litigation.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-84\">\n   <strong>\n    2.\n    <em>\n     Final Judgment on the Merits\n    </em>\n   </strong>\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-85\">\n   The First Lawsuit terminated in a final judgment against the Aminas due to\n   their failure to prosecute and comply with court orders.
