FLANAGAN, United States District Judge\n   This matter is before the court on plaintiff's amended motion for preliminary injunction (DE 36); defendants East Carolina University, Jody Cook (\"Cook\"), Mark D. Iannettoni (\"Iannettoni\"), and John Mark Williams's (\"Williams\") (collectively, \"ECU defendants\") motion to dismiss (DE 73); defendant MagMutual Insurance Company's (\"MagMutual\") motion to dismiss (DE 78); and the parties' motions to seal various documents (DE 39; DE 47; DE 82). The issues raised have been fully briefed and are ripe for adjudication. For the following reasons, the court grants defendant MagMutual's motion to dismiss, grants in part and denies in part ECU defendants' motion to dismiss, grants the parties' motions to seal, and denies plaintiff's motion for preliminary injunction.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-10\">\n   <strong>\n    STATEMENT OF THE CASE\n   </strong>\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-11\">\n   Plaintiff commenced this action by complaint filed August 15, 2017, together with motion for temporary restraining order and preliminary injunction. On September 1, 2017, the court denied without prejudice plaintiff's motion for temporary restraining order and preliminary injunction, directing plaintiff to file an amended motion for preliminary injunction on or before September 22, 2017, \"including specification of the injunctive relief sought and the defendants against whom the relief is sought.\" (DE 21 at 4-5). On September 12, 2017, the court granted the parties' consent motion for protective order, and thereafter, plaintiff filed the instant amended motion for preliminary injunction on September 26, 2017, following the court's grant of an extension of time so to do.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-12\">\n   Plaintiff seeks injunctive relief concerning a medical malpractice payment report related to a sternotomy procedure performed on April 14, 2015, submitted by defendant MagMutual to the National Practitioner Data Bank (\"NPDB\"), wherein plaintiff is allegedly falsely identified as the person responsible for performing the procedure. Plaintiff requests an order requiring defendant MagMutual void the NPDB report and take steps to render the effects of submitting the report null, as well as an order prohibiting defendant MagMutual from filing any additional NPDB reports concerning the procedure at issue during the pendency of this litigation. (DE 36 at 1-3; DE 55 at 8 (clarifying injunctive request is solely against defendant MagMutual) ).\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-13\">\n   Plaintiff relies upon her own affidavit together with that of Dr. Alan P. Kypson, North Carolina licensed physician. (DE 37-1, DE 37-2). She also relies upon certain documentary evidence, the authenticity of which appears undisputed. These materials include NPDB guidebook excerpts and pamphlet concerning North Carolina Medical Board (\"NCMB\") investigations. (DE 37-5, DE 37-6). Also included, and filed under seal, are the following documents regarding the settlement process with patient regarding the April 14, 2015 procedure and ensuing NPDB and North\n   Carolina medical malpractice reports: 1) correspondence among plaintiff and others including defendants Cook and MagMutual concerning both settlement process and ensuing reports; 2) correspondence among patient and others including defendants Cook and MagMutual concerning the settlement process; 3) the confidential settlement agreement and release; 4) the NPDB and North Carolina medical malpractice reports; and 5) a letter from the North Carolina Medical Board to plaintiff concerning its review of the settlement made on plaintiff's behalf. (DE 38, DE 38-1, DE 38-2, DE 38-3; DE 38-4). Additionally, the following documents are included, also filed under seal: patient's medical charts dating September 3, 2014 through May 2, 2016; job posting advertisement for clinical instructor at East Carolina University; and correspondence from defendant Iannettoni to plaintiff concerning the termination of plaintiff's employment at East Carolina University. (DE 38, DE 38-1, DE 38-3).\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-14\">\n   Thereafter, defendants filed motions to dismiss; however, plaintiff subsequently filed an amended complaint on November 7, 2017, rendering defendants' motions moot. Plaintiff's claims as found in her amended complaint relate to 1) the NPDB report and 2) gender discrimination related to her employment at ECU. More specifically, plaintiff asserts seven claims for relief, which are as follows:\n  </p>\n  <blockquote id=\"p-15\">\n   1) Claims against defendants Williams, Iannettoni, and Cook, in their official capacities, and against defendant MagMutual, for declaratory and injunctive relief;\n  </blockquote>\n  <blockquote id=\"p-16\">\n   2) Claims against defendants Williams, Iannettoni, and Cook, in their individual capacities, for violations of the Fourteenth Amendment pursuant to\n   <extracted-citation index=\"0\" url=\"https://cite.case.law/citations/?q=42%20U.S.C.%20%C2%A7%201983\">\n    42 U.S.C. \u00a7 1983\n   </extracted-citation>\n   for unequal treatment under the law;\n  </blockquote>\n  <blockquote id=\"p-17\">\n   3) Claim against defendant Cook, in her individual capacity, for violation of the Fourteenth Amendment pursuant to\n   <extracted-citation index=\"1\" url=\"https://cite.case.law/citations/?q=42%20U.S.C.%20%C2%A7%201983\">\n    42 U.S.C. \u00a7 1983\n   </extracted-citation>\n   for deprivation of due process rights;\n  </blockquote>\n  <blockquote id=\"p-18\">\n   4) Claim against defendant MagMutual for unfair and deceptive practices act, in violation of\n   <extracted-citation index=\"2\" url=\"https://cite.case.law/citations/?q=N.C.%20Gen.%20Stat.%20%C2%A7%2075-1.1\">\n    N.C.

(\n   <em>\n    Id.\n   </em>\n   at 2).\n   <footnotemark>\n    2\n   </footnotemark>\n   On December 5, 2017, both ECU defendants and defendant MagMutual filed the instant motions to dismiss plaintiff's amended complaint. Both groups of defendants assert in part that the court lacks jurisdiction over plaintiff's claims related to the NPDB report because 1) plaintiff failed to exhaust her administrative remedies regarding the NPDB report and 2) defendants have immunity under the Health Care Quality Improvement Act (\"HCQIA\"),\n   <extracted-citation index=\"4\" url=\"https://cite.case.law/citations/?q=42%20U.S.C.%20%C2%A7%2011101\">\n    42 U.S.C. \u00a7 11101\n   </extracted-citation>\n   <em>\n    etseq.\n   </em>\n   , under which the report was made to the NPDB. Plaintiff filed responses to both motions to dismiss on January 9, 2018, to which both defendants filed replies on January 23, 2018.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-33\">\n   <strong>\n    STATEMENT OF THE FACTS\n   </strong>\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-34\">\n   The facts alleged in the amended complaint may be summarized as follows.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-35\">\n   A. Allegations Related to the NPDB Report\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-36\">\n   Between July 2014 and October 2016 plaintiff was employed in the Department of Cardiovascular Surgery at the Brody School of Medicine at East Carolina University (\"ECU\") as a clinical fellow. Plaintiff assisted the attending surgeons, including defendant Williams, who treated patients at the East Carolina Heart Institute, a clinical practice associated with ECU's School of Medicine and Vidant Medical Center in Greenville, North Carolina.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-37\">\n   According to plaintiff, although she is a well-trained and experienced physician, her role as a fellow in the East Carolina Heart Institute was that of a trainee in a graduate health professions education program. Plaintiff was authorized to perform clinical duties and responsibilities within the context of the graduate educational program and thus, could not and did not, perform clinical duties without the direction and supervision of attending physicians.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-38\">\n   On April 14, 2015, plaintiff assisted defendant Williams in the surgical case of a patient who was scheduled for an aortic valve replacement (hereinafter, \"the patient\"). Defendant Williams was the attending surgeon who was identified on all medical records as the patient's primary surgeon.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-39\">\n   Prior to surgery, the patient had been examined by at least two other physicians who had reviewed echocardiogram studies, including a transesophageal echocardiogram (\"TEE\"), and agreed that her diagnosis was severe aortic valve insufficiency and that she required valve replacement surgery. Defendant Williams saw his patient on April 6, 2015, to discuss her \"upcoming aortic valve replacement.\" (Am. Compl. (DE 67) at 5).\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-40\">\n   The day before the surgery, plaintiff confirmed that the patient's cardiologist and defendant Williams had reviewed the pre-operative studies and were confident that the patient should undergo the planned aortic valve replacement surgery. Pursuant to the usual and customary practice, a TEE was performed on the day of the surgery by an anesthesiologist once the patient was fully anesthetized. Before entering the operating room, plaintiff advised defendant Williams that the patient was fully anesthetized and ready for him to begin the procedure. Defendant Williams instructed plaintiff to begin the sternotomy. Defendant Williams came to the operating room approximately one hour after he had instructed plaintiff to begin the procedure. Approximately forty-five minutes after that, the anesthesiologist returned to the operating room and, at this point, defendant Williams read the TEE report. A total of sixty-five minutes elapsed between the time the anesthesiologist visualized the patient's heart valves with his probe and the time that the TEE report was brought to the operating room.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-41\">\n   When the TEE report was brought to the operating room, the report differed with what the other reports had concluded and indicated that the patient's aortic valve insufficiency was \"moderate,\" not severe, suggesting that an aortic valve replacement should not be performed. (\n   <em>\n    Id.\n   </em>\n   at 6). Defendant Williams elected to stop the procedure.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-42\">\n   On or around April 16, 2015, before she was discharged from Vidant Medical Center, the patient complained about her treatment to risk management at Vidant Medical Center. Responding to the patient's concerns, Vidant's risk manager directed the patient to the risk management department at ECU School of Medicine. None of plaintiff's supervisors, nor anyone from defendant ECU's risk management department, spoke with plaintiff about this patient's complaint during the time that plaintiff was employed as a clinical fellow. No disciplinary action was taken or suggested against plaintiff and no one suggested that she had acted without the authority of her attending physician.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-43\">\n   Subsequent to plaintiff leaving her fellowship at ECU, on or around November 12, 2016, the patient communicated with defendant Cook, ECU's director of risk management, through counsel, and asserted a claim for personal injuries \"against ECU\" associated with the halted procedure. (\n   <em>\n    Id.\n   </em>\n   ). A follow-up letter sent to defendant Cook stated that among the patient's complaints was a complaint about an \"unnecessary median sternotomy performed by Mark J. Williams, M.D.\" (\n   <em>\n    Id.\n   </em>\n   ). In addition, the complaint included damages associated with the failure to make a proper diagnosis of the patient's condition prior to the hospital admission.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-44\">\n   After receiving the November 12, 2016 communication, the patient's claim was referred to defendant ECU's insurance\n   company, defendant MagMutual, who provided insurance coverage for this claim under Policy Number PSL 1700794-15 (\"2015-2016 policy\").\n   <footnotemark>\n    3\n   </footnotemark>\n   ECU is the named insured on the policy and plaintiff, defendant Williams, and the other ECU practitioners involved in this patient's case, by virtue of their employment with ECU, are also insureds under this policy.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-45\">\n   ECU's policy with MagMutual is a \"claims-made and reported policy,\" applicable to claims first made and incidents first reported to MagMutual by ECU during the policy period. (DE 75 at 16). Plaintiff alleges as of July 1, 2015, individual physicians insured under ECU's policy with MagMutual did not have the right to consent to settlement. (Am. Compl. (DE 67) at 6-7; DE 75 at 18, 41, 75 (\"We will not settle the claim without the prior consent of the individual designated by the organization listed in the 'Policy issued to' section of the Declarations page.\");\n   <em>\n    <extracted-citation index=\"5\" url=\"https://cite.case.law/citations/?q=42%20U.S.C.%20%C2%A7%2011101\">\n     id.\n    </extracted-citation>\n   </em>\n   <extracted-citation index=\"5\" url=\"https://cite.case.law/citations/?q=42%20U.S.C.%20%C2%A7%2011101\">\n    at 5\n   </extracted-citation>\n   (under the \"policy issued to\" section of the declarations page, the 2015-2016 policy identifies \"The Brody School of Medicine, Attn: Jody Cook-Dir Risk Management.\") ).\n   <footnotemark>\n    4\n   </footnotemark>\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-46\">\n   In December 2016, defendant MagMutual's adjuster contacted plaintiff and notified her that they were reviewing the April 14, 2015 \"incident.\" (Am. Compl. (DE 67) at 7). The adjuster told plaintiff not to discuss the matter with anyone other than him, another MagMutual representative, or risk management staff at ECU. On December 22, 2016, January 24, 2017, February 28, 2017, and April 6, 2017, defendant MagMutual's claims adjuster acknowledged to the patient's attorney that the claim was under review. Plaintiff's name was not mentioned in any of these exchanges.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-47\">\n   The patient's attorney stated that he had not obtained an expert review of the alleged negligence, having spoken only \"informally\" with an expert, and, according to plaintiff, no expert review was provided, or required to be provided, to defendant MagMutual. (\n   <em>\n    Id.\n   </em>\n   at 7-8).\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-48\">\n   Plaintiff spoke with defendant Cook about the patient's claim on April 25, 2017. Defendant Cook told plaintiff that the patient and the patient's attorney knew \"her name and her role in the surgery.\" (\n   <em>\n    Id.\n   </em>\n   at 8). Defendant Cook also advised plaintiff that obtaining legal representation would be futile as it would \"not necessarily influence the decisions made\" by defendants MagMutual and ECU. (\n   <em>\n    Id.\n   </em>\n   ).\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-49\">\n   Defendant MagMutual presented its evaluation of the patient's claim to defendant Cook, who, in turn, presented the information to a group identified as \"Brody School of Medicine senior leadership.\" (\n   <em>\n    Id.\n   </em>\n   ). This \"senior leadership team,\" which plaintiff alleges included defendants Iannettoni and Williams, authorized defendant Cook to communicate to MagMutual that MagMutual was authorized to negotiate a settlement with the patient's attorney, on behalf of plaintiff. Following that authorization, the senior leadership team determined that the claim would be settled in plaintiff's name, and only plaintiff's name.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-50\">\n   On June 19, 2017, defendant ECU communicated its rationale for settling the patient's claim and falsely asserted to plaintiff that the patient's attorney had identified plaintiff as the negligent party. Plaintiff alleges defendant MagMutual reviewed and ratified ECU's letter to plaintiff.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-51\">\n   After learning that defendant ECU had decided to settle the patient's claim identifying her as the sole responsible provider, plaintiff obtained legal counsel. Plaintiff's counsel advised defendants ECU and MagMutual of his retention by plaintiff and advised MagMutual of its conflict of interest between its insureds. Defendant MagMutual did not respond nor did defendant provide plaintiff or her counsel with an opportunity to review the medical malpractice settlement agreement prior to it being executed.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-52\">\n   As a result of ECU's decision to settle the patient's claim listing only plaintiff as the responsible physician, MAG Mutual submitted a medical malpractice payment report (\"report\") to the National Practitioner's Data Bank (\"NPDB\") on August 10, 2017. (\n   <em>\n    Id.\n   </em>\n   at 9; DE 38-2 at 20-22).\n   <footnotemark>\n    5\n   </footnotemark>\n   The report states the responsibility for the patient's allegedly unnecessary procedure was wholly plaintiff's responsibility.\n   <footnotemark>\n    6\n   </footnotemark>\n   The report sent to the NPDB was accompanied by a supplemental statement required by the North Carolina Medical Board. Plaintiff alleges the report and its supplement identify plaintiff as an \"assistant surgeon,\" but omit the fact that she was a clinical fellow, that defendant Williams began the\n   surgical procedure prior to receiving the radiology report, that defendant Williams was in the operating room with plaintiff for approximately forty-five minutes prior to the radiology report being brought to the operating room, and falsely states that the sternotomy was performed before defendant Williams's arrival to the operating room. (Am. Compl. (DE 67) at 9). According to plaintiff, these omissions indicate plaintiff performed the procedure without authorization.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-53\">\n   The report states that plaintiff \"disagrees with the allocation of this settlement.\" (\n   <em>\n    Id.\n   </em>\n   at 10). The statement required for the North Carolina Medical Board also includes an admission by defendants that \"liability is questionable,\" and that the conclusion regarding liability is based on defendant MagMutual's own expert review as well as the internal review conducted by defendant ECU. (\n   <em>\n    Id.\n   </em>\n   ).\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-54\">\n   According to the amended complaint, any prospective employer of plaintiff's is required by law to review the NPDB's listing of plaintiff. The NPDB report and the North Carolina Medical Board supplement were sent to the NPDB, the North Carolina Medical Board and licensing boards in the states of Massachusetts, California, and New York.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-55\">\n   Prior to submitting the NPDB report, defendant ECU told plaintiff that she would have an opportunity to \"indicate [her] disagreement with the decision\" to settle the malpractice claim. (\n   <em>\n    Id.\n   </em>\n   ). Defendant Cook reviewed a draft of the NPDB report on or around July 31, 2017, and then forwarded that draft to plaintiff's counsel on August 1, 2017, stating that the due date to submit the report was August 18, 2017. Plaintiff's counsel responded to the draft on August 3, 2017 and asked to have a conversation with defendant Cook. Defendant Cook never responded to that request. Additions to the reports were made between August 1, 2017, and August 10, 2017, when the reports were sent to the NPDB and the medical licensing agencies. Those additions were never shared with plaintiff. The NPDB report was submitted on August 10, 2017, and plaintiff was not informed of the submission until August 14, 2017.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-56\">\n   According to plaintiff, this \"report will stigmatize [plaintiff] for the remainder of her career,\" including when plaintiff seeks employment, medical malpractice insurance, board certification, and in maintaining licensure, or seeking additional medical licenses. (\n   <em>\n    Id.\n   </em>\n   at 11). Plaintiff has been notified that the North Carolina Medical Board is investigating the facts surrounding the filing of the medical malpractice payment report. Plaintiff has also received queries from other state licensing agencies.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-57\">\n   According to plaintiff, the ECU defendants reported plaintiff instead of defendant Williams, because \"[t]he male leadership at ECU chose to protect its own interests\" and \"because the custom of the leadership at ECU is to choose to benefit males at the expense of females, because they are male.\" (\n   <em>\n    Id.\n   </em>\n   at 11-12).\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-58\">\n   B. Allegations Related to Sex Discrimination\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-59\">\n   Plaintiff was recruited for an employment position in the East Carolina Heart Institute, and ECU faculty represented to plaintiff that, by accepting employment as a fellow, a position that necessitated she take a substantial loss in pay, she would be more likely to receive a regular faculty appointment in the Department of Cardiothoracic surgery. As plaintiff's employment as a fellow continued into 2015 and 2016, plaintiff was repeatedly told that the faculty intended to offer her a regular faculty appointment.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-60\">\n   During Spring of 2016, ECU advertised a regular faculty position in a division of the Department of Cardiovascular Sciences, a position for which plaintiff asserts she was eminently qualified. During this time, defendant Iannettoni and a professor from the Harvard School of Medicine, one of plaintiff's references, discussed plaintiff's pending application for the available faculty position, and defendant Iannettoni stated that plaintiff would be interviewed for the position. The professor had called defendant Iannettoni because he was aware that plaintiff had applied for a position and that he, the professor, had been identified as an employment reference. When the professor had not received a request for a reference from defendant Iannettoni, the professor initiated the telephone call. Subsequently, plaintiff learned that defendant Iannettoni intentionally did not call this reference nor any of the other references listed on her application because he never intended to interview her for the available position.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-61\">\n   Plaintiff was not provided the opportunity to interview, and a male applicant, whose experience and qualifications were inferior to plaintiff's credentials, was hired instead. Plaintiff was told by defendant Iannettoni that she was not a desirable candidate for the position because other faculty found her \"intimidating.\" (\n   <em>\n    Id.\n   </em>\n   at 16). During the previous two years, plaintiff had received a positive review and recommendations for contract renewal. Plaintiff had never been provided any feedback suggesting that defendant Iannettoni's statement was authentic. Defendant Iannettoni's statement was at odds with observable behavior on the part of staff, who referred to plaintiff by her first name while referring to other male physicians by their title.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-62\">\n   When plaintiff was not offered an opportunity to compete for a faculty position, she asked defendant Iannettoni if he would agree to extend her employment again on a contractual basis. Plaintiff alleges that although other male clinical instructors and clinical fellow who have made a similar request were given six months to one-year contract extensions, defendant Iannettoni only agreed to a three-month extension of plaintiff's contract. Plaintiff also sought an available\n   <em>\n    locum tenens\n   </em>\n   position advertised by ECU. A male surgeon who had less relevant skills and experience than the plaintiff was offered the position instead.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-63\">\n   According to plaintiff, the Department of Cardiovascular Sciences and the Division of Cardiothoracic Surgery have a reputation for unequal treatment of female employees and a lack of responsiveness to the complaints by female employees about unequal treatment. According to plaintiff, \"the reputation arose from complaints of female employees about the conduct directed toward them by male employees, particularly male employees in leadership or supervisory positions.\" (\n   <em>\n    Id.\n   </em>\n   at 17). Defendant ECU had resolved at least one other sex discrimination complaint during the time of plaintiff's employment based on sexist conduct of one of the department's male physicians directed to a female employee.\n   <footnotemark>\n    7\n   </footnotemark>\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-64\">\n   During the time that plaintiff was employed in the Department of Cardiovascular Sciences, there were some, but few, males in clinical support roles such as nursing; there were no females in leadership positions; and advertisements on the department's website depicted males primarily in leadership roles and females as\n   warm and helpful. Plaintiff alleges male leadership preferred to interview and hire surgeons who were male and were quick to denigrate female surgeons.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-65\">\n   According to plaintiff, during the course of her fellowship, plaintiff was often treated less favorably than similarly-situated male employees, including in the ways that male supervising faculty interacted with her, as well as in the decisions that were made regarding her employment contracts; additionally, 1) plaintiff was expected to get coffee for male faculty, answer the chief of staff's phone, and get defendant Williams food and drink, which nurses, but not other physicians, were asked to do; 2) defendant Williams would address plaintiff by her first name instead of doctor, defendants Iannettoni and Williams addressed male physicians by their titles, and another female clinical fellow who is female was also addressed by her first name; 3) defendant Williams flirted with female physician assistants and nurse practitioners to the point of making plaintiff uncomfortable; and 4) defendant Williams was critical of a female thoracic surgeon who he claimed did not want to work hard because she wanted to have babies.

After plaintiff complained, according to plaintiff, defendant Williams's hostility toward plaintiff intensified. On mornings when the two were to conduct rounds on patients, defendant Williams would begin without plaintiff, even though she was at work and prepared to begin rounds. When the two were in the Intensive Care Unit, Williams would completely ignore plaintiff.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-67\">\n   Plaintiff left ECU in October 2016, taking a position with another practice in another state.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-68\">\n   When plaintiff was contacted by defendant Cook regarding the patient who had filed a claim, defendant Cook told plaintiff that defendant Williams denied giving Plaintiff an order to initiate the sternotomy on the patient.

In defendants' view, if the words in the report are true, defendants are entitled to immunity. Plaintiff disagrees, but appears to have shifted in what she alleges is untrue about the report.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-94\">\n   In plaintiff's amended complaint, plaintiff alleges the following about the NPDB report:\n  </p>\n  <blockquote id=\"p-95\">\n   The report states that 100% of the responsibility for the patient's allegedly unnecessary procedure was Dr. Robinson's responsibility.... the report and its supplement identify Dr. Robinson as an \"assistant surgeon,\" but omit the fact that she was a Clinical Fellow. The reports omit the fact that Dr. Williams had ordered Dr. Robinson to begin the surgical\n   procedure prior to receiving the radiology report. The reports omit the fact that Dr. Williams was in the operating room with Dr. Robinson for approximately forty-five minutes prior to the radiology report being brought to the operating room and falsely states that the sternotomy was performed before Dr. Williams' arrival to the operating room. By its omissions, the report intends that the reader will conclude that Dr. Robinson performed the procedure without authorization. The report states that Dr. Robinson \"disagrees with the allocation of this settlement.\" The statement required for the North Carolina Medical Board also includes an admission by Defendants that \"liability is questionable,\" and that the conclusion regarding liability is based on Defendant MagMutual's own expert review as well as the internal review conducted by Defendant ECU.\n  </blockquote>\n  <p id=\"p-96\">\n   (Am. Compl. (DE 67) at 9-10).\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-97\">\n   Now, based on plaintiff's submissions to the court in response to defendants' motions to dismiss, plaintiff alleges or clarifies that the NPDB report is false in two respects, one of which plaintiff has consistently maintained, that the report is false by stating plaintiff \"was the only practitioner responsible for the alleged medical malpractice,\" but also that the report is false in that it \"fails to state the true nature of the patient's claim.\" (DE 86 at 10 citing (Am.

(DE 67) at 9), and 2) omitted information, thus misleading the reader.\n   <footnotemark>\n    16\n   </footnotemark>\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-99\">\n   Although plaintiff challenges the underlying validity of the allocated responsibility for the procedure performed and the accuracy of the information presented during those proceedings, plaintiff has not argued that the report submitted inaccurately summarized those proceedings. (\n   <em>\n    See\n   </em>\n   <em>\n    id.\n   </em>\n   at 12 (\"During this process, defendant MagMutual ... allowed the grounds for the settlement to be based on defendant ECU's internal review of its own potentially liable attending physician and an outside\n   expert who was not in Plaintiff's medical specialty.\") ). Additionally, the omitted information pointed out by plaintiff also pertains to the allocated responsibility as determined by the ECU senior leadership team in that the omitted information supports plaintiff's position that defendant Williams, and not plaintiff, is responsible for the procedure performed.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-100\">\n   Nevertheless, plaintiff argues that immunity should be denied because defendants knew the decision made by the ECU senior leadership team was based on false information, and in fact defendant Williams did authorize the procedure and, more generally, defendant Williams was overall responsible for the procedure.\n   <footnotemark>\n    17\n   </footnotemark>\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-101\">\n   Few courts have confronted this issue, what is \"false\" for the purposes of \u00a7 11137(c), in the context of a report based on settlement of a medical malpractice claim, pursuant to \u00a7 11131.

Plaintiff alleges that the report \"states that 100% of the responsibility for the patient's allegedly unnecessary procedure\" was plaintiff's, that plaintiff \"disagrees with the allocation of this settlement,\" and includes in a supplemental filing an \"admission by Defendants that\n   'liability is questionable.' \" (Am.

Of particular importance is that plaintiff performed the surgery at issue and defendant Williams did not, thus plaintiff and defendant are not similarly situated for the purposes of this analysis, whether ECU defendants treated defendant Williams more favorably than plaintiff in holding plaintiff solely responsible for the procedure at issue. Additionally, plaintiff's amended complaint states additional differences undercutting plaintiff's position that she and defendant Williams were similarly situated, in that plaintiff was a fellow on patient's case, not the attending, she was no longer at the institution at the time patient's claim was made a resolved, and she was not part of senior leadership at ECU.

At the direction of the court to show cause why the motion for preliminary injunction should not be denied as moot, plaintiff asserts that the third revised report does not restore plaintiff to her previous position before the issuance of the first report and plaintiff still seeks a court-ordered preliminary injunction.
