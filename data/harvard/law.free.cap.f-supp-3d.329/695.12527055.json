Plaintiff LSP Transmission Holdings (\"LSP\") alleges that the statute discriminates against out-of-state transmission developers in favor of in-state utilities. Defendants\n   <footnotemark>\n    1\n   </footnotemark>\n   have filed separate motions to dismiss LSP's lawsuit. (Doc. Nos. 18, 37 &amp; 48.) For the reasons set forth below, the Court grants the motions.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-14\">\n   <strong>\n    BACKGROUND\n   </strong>\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-15\">\n   This case involves electric generation, transmission, and delivery. Electricity is provided to consumers in three steps: (1) electricity is generated at various power plants; (2) electricity is transmitted on an integrated system of large power lines (\"transmission lines\"); and (3) electricity is then distributed to consumers through a network of smaller power lines (\"distribution lines\"). Electricity placed on transmission lines becomes part of an integrated, interstate system. State regulation of industries, such as the electrical industry, has long been recognized as a valid exercise of a state's police powers.\n   <em>\n    See\n   </em>\n   <em>\n    Munn v.

The Federal Energy Regulatory Commission (\"FERC\") exercises authority over the interstate transmission of electric energy and its sale at wholesale in interstate commerce.\n   <extracted-citation index=\"2\" url=\"https://cite.case.law/citations/?q=16%20U.S.C.%20%C2%A7%20824\">\n    16 U.S.C. \u00a7 824\n   </extracted-citation>\n   (b)(1).

The PUC also ensures that each utility provides \"safe, adequate, efficient, and reasonable service\" and \"make[s] adequate infrastructure investments.\"\n   <em>\n    <extracted-citation case-ids=\"3362818\" index=\"5\" url=\"https://cite.case.law/f3d/558/304/#p310\">\n     Id.\n    </extracted-citation>\n   </em>\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-18\">\n   FERC is empowered to \"divide the country into regional districts for the voluntary interconnection and coordination of facilities for the generation, transmission, and sale of electric energy\" and has the \"duty\" to \"promote and encourage such interconnection and coordination within each such district and between such districts.\" 16 U.S.C. \u00a7 824a(a). Regionally, FERC-approved nongovernmental agencies,\n   independent system operators (\"ISO\"s), oversee the operation and expansion of electric transmission grids. (Doc. No. 1 (\"Compl.\") \u00b6 14.) Each ISO issues a tariff, which establishes the terms by which its members build and operate grids. (\n   <em>\n    Id.\n   </em>\n   \u00b6 15.) These tariffs are subject to the approval of FERC.

The Government's statement was filed by the Justice Department's Antitrust Division. The Court allowed the parties to respond to the Statement of Interest. (Doc. Nos. 72-76.) As aptly noted by NSP and ITC Midwest, the Antitrust Division's statement is untimely, as it was filed roughly two and one-half months after briefing was completed. Moreover, the Antitrust Department offers no explanation, let alone good cause, for its delay.

Minn. Stat. \u00a7 216B.246 is part of the Minnesota's broader regulation of the provision of electricity to the consumer market. Many of the entities that own existing transmission facilities are regulated public utilities, who serve captive markets and have monopolies with respect to the sale of electricity to consumers. Thus, for these sales, there is no competition and the dormant Commerce Clause does not apply.\n   <em>\n    See, e.g.\n   </em>\n   ,\n   <em>\n    Tracy\n   </em>\n   ,\n   <extracted-citation case-ids=\"11595433\" index=\"91\" url=\"https://cite.case.law/us/519/278/#p287\">\n    519 U.S. at 303\n   </extracted-citation>\n   ,\n   <extracted-citation case-ids=\"11595433\" index=\"92\" url=\"https://cite.case.law/us/519/278/#p287\">\n    117 S.Ct. 811\n   </extracted-citation>\n   . However, the Court recognizes that local utilities in Minnesota and out-of-state entities may compete for the right to build transmission lines. In this case, LSP alleges that it wishes to compete against Minnesota electric utilities for the right to build transmission lines, but that it is being discriminated against by Minn. Stat. \u00a7 216B.246. (Compl. \u00b6\u00b6 75-78.) Under\n   <em>\n    Tracy\n   </em>\n   , however, the Court grants controlling weight to the monopoly market. Minnesota is entitled to consider the effect on the public utilities and the consumers that the utilities serve and \"to give the greater weight to the captive market and the local utilities' singular role in serving it.\"\n   <em>\n    Tracy\n   </em>\n   ,\n   <extracted-citation case-ids=\"11595433\" index=\"93\" url=\"https://cite.case.law/us/519/278/#p287\">\n    519 U.S. at 304\n   </extracted-citation>\n   ,\n   <extracted-citation case-ids=\"11595433\" index=\"94\" url=\"https://cite.case.law/us/519/278/#p287\">\n    117 S.Ct. 811\n   </extracted-citation>\n   . Moreover, like in\n   <em>\n    Tracy\n   </em>\n   , where the Supreme Court determined that the possibility of a negative impact on the ability of utilities to serve consumers in the monopoly market weighed against invalidating the challenged statute, the same holds true here.\n   <em>\n    Tracy\n   </em>\n   ,\n   <extracted-citation case-ids=\"11595433\" index=\"95\" url=\"https://cite.case.law/us/519/278/#p287\">\n    519 U.S. at 309\n   </extracted-citation>\n   ,\n   <extracted-citation case-ids=\"11595433\" index=\"96\" url=\"https://cite.case.law/us/519/278/#p287\">\n    117 S.Ct. 811\n   </extracted-citation>\n   . The reasons cited in support of giving greater weight to the monopoly market in\n   <em>\n    Tracy\n   </em>\n   apply here; namely, to avoid any jeopardy or disruption to the service of electricity to the state electricity consumers and to allow for the provision of a reliable supply of electricity.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-51\">\n   In addition, as was the case in\n   <em>\n    Tracy\n   </em>\n   , the economic consequences of any Court intervention to strike down Minn. Stat. \u00a7 216B.246 are unclear.\n   <em>\n    <extracted-citation case-ids=\"11595433\" index=\"97\" url=\"https://cite.case.law/us/519/278/#p287\">\n     Id.\n    </extracted-citation>\n   </em>\n   <extracted-citation case-ids=\"11595433\" index=\"97\" url=\"https://cite.case.law/us/519/278/#p287\">\n    at 307\n   </extracted-citation>\n   ,\n   <extracted-citation case-ids=\"11595433\" index=\"98\" url=\"https://cite.case.law/us/519/278/#p287\">\n    117 S.Ct. 811\n   </extracted-citation>\n   . Under Minn. Stat. \u00a7 216B.46, Minnesota not only gives existing owners a right of first refusal to build new transmission lines that will connect to their existing facilities, but in return Minnesota also places extensive regulatory burdens on those owners. Any intervention by the Court could upset the balance between those burdens and regulation. Importantly, Congress and FERC have both indicated that Minnesota is entitled to make the policy decision to adopt a right of first refusal to build new transmission lines. And as it has been noted many times before, Congress, FERC, and the Minnesota legislature are \"better-situated than the courts\" to \"determine the economic wisdom and the health and safety effects\" of a decision on the correct balance between competition and a right of first refusal in the area of the building of electric transmission facilities.\n   <em>\n    See, e.g.\n   </em>\n   ,\n   <em>\n    Allco\n   </em>\n   ,\n   <extracted-citation case-ids=\"12276112\" index=\"99\" url=\"https://cite.case.law/f3d/861/82/#p86\">\n    861 F.3d at 107\n   </extracted-citation>\n   . The Court, therefore, properly defers to their judgment.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-52\">\n   The Court has considered, but is not persuaded by, LSP's arguments that\n   <em>\n    Tracy\n   </em>\n   is inapposite. First, LSP argues that Minn. Stat. \u00a7 216B.246 does not single out providers that serve retail consumers as the sole beneficiaries of the statute's protection, but instead that it protects all transmission owning entities in Minnesota. This distinction, however, is not persuasive. While it is true that Minn. Stat. \u00a7 216B.246 relates to transmission lines, the main principle of\n   <em>\n    Tracy\n   </em>\n   -that there cannot be discrimination between entities that are not similarly situated-applies here. Regulated utilities (the existing transmission line owners with a right of first refusal) are not similarly situated with unregulated entities such as LSP.\n   <em>\n    See\n   </em>\n   <em>\n    id.\n   </em>\n   at 298-99,\n   <extracted-citation case-ids=\"11595433\" index=\"100\" url=\"https://cite.case.law/us/519/278/#p287\">\n    117 S.Ct. 811\n   </extracted-citation>\n   . Second, LSP argues that the Court is not required to defer to Minnesota's policy decision, and in particular because this case, unlike in\n   <em>\n    Tracy\n   </em>\n   , does not involve a tax law (and its \"subtle complexities\"). The Supreme Court in\n   <em>\n    Tracy\n   </em>\n   , however, explained that the dormant Commerce Clause \"prohibits state taxation\n   <em>\n    or regulation\n   </em>\n   that discriminates against or unduly burdens interstate commerce.\"\n   <extracted-citation case-ids=\"11595433\" index=\"101\" url=\"https://cite.case.law/us/519/278/#p287\">\n    519 U.S. at 287\n   </extracted-citation>\n   ,\n   <extracted-citation case-ids=\"11595433\" index=\"102\" url=\"https://cite.case.law/us/519/278/#p287\">\n    117 S.Ct. 811\n   </extracted-citation>\n   (emphasis added). The relevant case law does not demand that tax statutes receive greater deference than regulatory statutes under the Commerce Clause.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-53\">\n   For all of the above reasons, the Court concludes that\n   <em>\n    Tracy\n   </em>\n   forecloses LSP's allegation that Minn. Stat. \u00a7 216B.246 overtly discriminates against out-of-state transmission developers.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-54\">\n   <strong>\n    B. Overt Discrimination\n   </strong>\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-55\">\n   Even if LSP's claim of overt discrimination was not foreclosed by\n   <em>\n    Tracy\n   </em>\n   , LSP's argument that Minn. Stat. \u00a7 216B.246 facially discriminates because it grants incumbents the right to build federally approved transmission line projects in Minnesota fails. There is no dispute that the statute grants a preference to \"incumbent electric transmission owners,\" but that preference does not discriminate against out-of-state entities. Instead, it affords companies whose facilities will connect to new transmission lines the first chance to build the new line. The statute's preference does not apply to all incumbent electric transmission owners, but only to those directly connected to the proposed line, whether those incumbents are in-state or out-of-state. The statute draws a neutral distinction between existing electric transmission owners whose facilities will connect to a new line and all other entities, regardless of whether they are in-state or out-of-state. In fact, the Complaint lists the sixteen entities that would qualify as\n   incumbents under Minn. Stat. \u00a7 216B.246, and five of those entities are headquartered outside of Minnesota. (Compl. \u00b6\u00b6 64-66; Doc. No. 39 at 26-27.)\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-56\">\n   In response, LSP argues that any owner of a transmission facility in Minnesota, regardless of their actual headquarters, should be considered \"in-state.\" The Court disagrees. Incumbency bias is not the same as discrimination against out-of-state interests.\n   <em>\n    See\n   </em>\n   <em>\n    Colon Health Ctrs. of Am., LLC v. Hazel\n   </em>\n   ,\n   <extracted-citation case-ids=\"4087791\" index=\"103\" url=\"https://cite.case.law/f3d/813/145/#p154\">\n    813 F.3d 145\n   </extracted-citation>\n   , 154 (4th Cir. 2016) (explaining that an incumbent recipient of a state benefit is not necessarily an \"in-state resident\"). Here, out-of-state companies can benefit from Minn. Stat. \u00a7 216B.246 on the same terms as a Minnesota company.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-57\">\n   For the above reasons, the Court concludes that LSP has failed to demonstrate that Minn. Stat. \u00a7 216B.246 discriminates against out-of-state entities.\n   <footnotemark>\n    8\n   </footnotemark>\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-58\">\n   <strong>\n    C.\n    <em>\n     Pike\n    </em>\n    Test\n   </strong>\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-59\">\n   LSP argues that even if Minn. Stat. \u00a7 216B.246 regulates evenhandedly, it violates the Commerce Clause under the\n   <em>\n    Pike\n   </em>\n   balancing test. Specifically, LSP claims that Minn.

In enacting Minn. Stat. \u00a7 216B.246, the Minnesota legislature determined that it is necessary to provide \"the retail consumers of natural gas and electric service in this state with adequate and reliable services at reasonable rates,\" and that the legislation was necessary \"to avoid unnecessary duplication of facilities which increase the cost of service to the consumer\" and \"to minimize disputes between public utilities which may result in inconvenience or diminish efficiency in service to the consumers.\"\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-61\">\n   Minn.

Stat. \u00a7 216B.246 with any incidental burden that the statute places on interstate commerce. LSP argues that the cumulative effect of individual states' right-of-first-refusal laws would nullify Order 1000's abolition of federal right-of-first-refusal laws and undermine its goals by effectively eliminating competition for transmission line projects. LSP asserts that giving incumbents the right of first refusal would eliminate competitive bidding for these projects and would place a significant burden on interstate commerce. Moreover, LSP contends that Minn. Stat. \u00a7 216B.246 burdens LSP individually by effectively barring it from competing via the FERC-approved process for regionally planned projects approved for construction in Minnesota. Finally, LSP asserts that the nature of the\n   <em>\n    Pike\n   </em>\n   balancing test is fact-intensive, making any decision premature.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-63\">\n   As explained above, Minn. Stat. \u00a7 216B.246 does not provide a preference to in-state companies. Instead, it gives a right of first refusal to companies (in-state or out-of-state) whose facilities will connect to the proposed transmission line. Any incidental effects on interstate commerce caused by giving existing facilities a right of first refusal are insufficient to outweigh the significant local interest described above.\n   <em>\n    See, e.g.\n   </em>\n   ,\n   <em>\n    Ark.

Where Congress and FERC have endorsed the state's role, a regulation will pass the\n   <em>\n    Pike\n   </em>\n   test if it was enacted in a \"legitimate state pursuit.\"\n   <em>\n    Allco\n   </em>\n   ,\n   <extracted-citation case-ids=\"12276112\" index=\"121\" url=\"https://cite.case.law/f3d/861/82/#p86\">\n    861 F.3d at 108\n   </extracted-citation>\n   .\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-66\">\n   After balancing under the\n   <em>\n    Pike\n   </em>\n   test, the Court concludes that any burden on interstate commerce is outweighed by the benefits of Minnesota's right-of-first-refusal statute. Moreover, the Court notes that economic and free market arguments are better left to legislators.\n   <em>\n    See\n   </em>\n   <em>\n    Colon Health Ctrs.\n   </em>\n   ,\n   <extracted-citation case-ids=\"4087791\" index=\"122\" url=\"https://cite.case.law/f3d/813/145/#p154\">\n    813 F.3d at 158\n   </extracted-citation>\n   .\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-67\">\n   For all of the above reasons, the Court determines that Minn.

This purpose is reflected by the comments of Senator David Brown, one of the bill's authors, at the Senate committee hearing on the ROFR bill: \"Our regulated system has served Minnesota well, and our system is reliable and our rates are fairly competitive....
