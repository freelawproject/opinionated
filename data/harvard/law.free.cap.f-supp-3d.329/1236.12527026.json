MSJ (Dkt. # 35) ). The court has considered the motions, the submissions filed in support of and in opposition to both motions, the relevant portions of the record, and the applicable law. In addition, on June 12, 2018, the court heard counsel's oral argument. Being fully advised, the court DENEIS Mr. Bancroft's motion for summary judgment and GRANTS Minnesota Life's cross motion as more fully described herein.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-11\">\n   <strong>\n    II. BACKGROUND\n   </strong>\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-12\">\n   <strong>\n    A. The Accelerated Benefits Policy Rider\n   </strong>\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-13\">\n   Mr. Bancroft is an employee of King County. (10/25/17 Bancroft Decl. (Dkt. # 8) \u00b6 2.) Minnesota Life issued a Group Term Life Insurance Policy (\"the Policy\") to King County. (Compl. (Dkt. # 1-1) \u00b6 4; Ans. (Dkt. # 4) \u00b6 4.) As a part of his benefits package, Mr. Bancroft is covered under the Policy. (Compl. \u00b6 6; Ans. \u00b6 6.) The Policy's Basic Life Insurance provision pays one year's salary upon acceptance of a claim. (\n   <em>\n    Id.\n   </em>\n   ) Mr. Bancroft also paid for Supplemental Life Insurance, which provides for an additional four years of salary as a death benefit. (\n   <em>\n    Id.\n   </em>\n   )\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-14\">\n   Included in the Policy is an Accelerated Benefits Policy Rider (\"the ABPR\"), which provides \"for the accelerated payment of ... the full ... amount of an insured's death benefit ... [i]f the insured has a terminal condition as defined in the [ABPR].\" (11/06/17 Marisseau Decl. (Dkt. # 16) \u00b6 4, Ex. A at ML 0037.) The ABPR defines a \"terminal condition\" as \"a condition caused by sickness or accident which directly results in a life expectancy of twenty-four months or less.\" (\n   <em>\n    Id.\n   </em>\n   ) The insured must request the accelerated payment and give Minnesota Life \"evidence that satisfies [Minnesota Life] that the insured's life expectancy, because of sickness or accident, is twenty-four months or less.\" (\n   <em>\n    Id.\n   </em>\n   ) The evidence that the insured provides\n   \"must include certification by a physician.\" (\n   <em>\n    Id.\n   </em>\n   ) The ABPR also states:\n  </p>\n  <blockquote id=\"p-15\">\n   [Minnesota Life] reserve[s] the right to ask for independent medical verification of a terminal condition. In the case of a difference of opinion, the insured has the right to mediation or binding arbitration conducted by a disinterested third party who has no ongoing relationship with either party.\n  </blockquote>\n  <p id=\"p-16\">\n   (\n   <em>\n    Id.\n   </em>\n   ) Finally, Minnesota Life \"retain[s] the right to have the insured medically examined at [its] own expense to verify the insured's medical condition.\"\n   <footnotemark>\n    1\n   </footnotemark>\n   (\n   <em>\n    Id.\n   </em>\n   )\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-17\">\n   <strong>\n    B. Mr. Bancroft's Diagnosis with Stage IV Mantle Cell Lymphoma\n   </strong>\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-18\">\n   Dr. Sherry Hu examined Mr. Bancroft on January 25, 2017. (Hu Decl. (Dkt. # 10) \u00b6 5.) On January 25, 2017, Dr. Hu performed a bone marrow biopsy on Mr. Bancroft and ordered a PET/CT scan. (\n   <em>\n    Id.\n   </em>\n   ) On January 30, 2017, Mr. Bancroft underwent a PET/CT scan. (\n   <em>\n    Id.\n   </em>\n   ) On February 1, 2017, Mr. Bancroft returned to the clinic, and Dr. Hu informed him that he had high risk stage IV mantle cell lymphoma and recommended immediate treatment. (\n   <em>\n    Id.\n   </em>\n   \u00b6 6;\n   <em>\n    see also\n   </em>\n   Plf. 1st MSJ (Dkt. # 7) at 4 (\"On February 1, 2017, [Mr.] Bancroft returned ... for the results of the biopsy and PET/CT.... At that time, Dr. Hu diagnosed him with Stage IV Mantle Cell Lymphoma and recommended immediate treatment.\");\n   <em>\n    see also\n   </em>\n   10/25/17 Bancroft Decl. \u00b6 6; Compl. \u00b6 16.)\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-19\">\n   On February 6, 2017, Mr. Bancroft came under the care of Dr. Andrew Cowan. (10/25/17 Bancroft Decl. \u00b6\u00b6 6-7.) Dr. Cowan confirmed Dr. Hu's diagnosis. (10/25/17 Cowan Decl. (Dkt. # 9) \u00b6 5.) Mr. Bancroft chose to see Dr. Cowan because he is an oncologist with expertise in mantle cell lymphoma. (10/25/17 Bancroft Decl. \u00b6 6.) Dr. Cowan prescribed a treatment regime, and Mr. Bancroft started chemotherapy on February 17, 2017. (\n   <em>\n    Id.\n   </em>\n   \u00b6 7.)\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-20\">\n   <strong>\n    C. Mr. Bancroft's Claim to Minnesota Life\n   </strong>\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-21\">\n   After his diagnosis, Mr. Bancroft completed a Notice of Claim for Accelerated Benefit, a form provided by Minnesota Life. (\n   <em>\n    Id.\n   </em>\n   \u00b6 11, Ex. C.) Mr. Bancroft submitted this form to Minnesota Life on or about May 16, 2017. (\n   <em>\n    Id.\n   </em>\n   ) He requested payment of \"100%\" of the accelerated benefit at that time. (\n   <em>\n    Id.\n   </em>\n   ) On May 26, 2017, Dr. Cowan signed an Attending Physician's Statement that was provided to Minnesota Life in support of Mr. Bancroft's claim. (\n   <em>\n    See id.\n   </em>\n   )\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-22\">\n   In the Attending Physician's Statement, Dr. Cowan states that Mr. Bancroft was \"diagnosed w/stage IV mantel cell lymphoma high risk leukemia presentation w/elevated LDH.\" (\n   <em>\n    Id.\n   </em>\n   at 5.) He states that Mr. Bancroft was undergoing VR-CAP treatment,\n   <footnotemark>\n    2\n   </footnotemark>\n   indicated that Mr. Bancroft's progress was \"[i]mproved,\" and noted that he expected \"[i]mprovement\" as a \"fundamental or marked change\" in Mr. Bancroft's condition.\n   <footnotemark>\n    3\n   </footnotemark>\n   (\n   <em>\n    Id.\n   </em>\n   at 5-6.)\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-23\">\n   Dr. Cowan indicated on the form that Mr. Bancroft's condition was terminal. (\n   <em>\n    Id.\n   </em>\n   at 6.) He states that Mr. Bancroft's Mantel Cell Lymphoma International prognostic index (\"MIPI\") score is 7.2,\n   <footnotemark>\n    4\n   </footnotemark>\n   but Dr. Cowan\n   does not base his prognosis for Mr. Bancroft on this score. (\n   <em>\n    See\n   </em>\n   Cowan Dep. at 56:24-75:5.) Instead, based on a 2007 \"publication in\n   <em>\n    Cancer\n   </em>\n   (PMID 17477385),\" Dr. Cowan opined that \"the median survival for [Mr. Bancroft] would be 24 months.\" (10/25/17 Bancroft Decl. \u00b6 11, Ex. C at 6 (italics added).) The paper on which Dr. Cowan relied was published before the MIPI score was developed in 2008. (11/13/17 Shapland Decl. \u00b6 18;\n   <em>\n    see\n   </em>\n   Cowan Dep. at 56:24-57:4 (\"Q: ... So Exhibit 13 is the stuff that you're referencing as, well, the only medical literature that you're citing in support of your prognosis? A: Yeah, uh-huh. Q: And that's a 2007 study? A: That's correct.\");\n   <em>\n    see id.\n   </em>\n   , Ex. 13.) Dr. Cowan later testified that his \"prognosis [also] included [his] overall evaluation of Mr. Bancroft at that time.\" (10/25/17 Cowan Decl. \u00b6 9.) Dr. Cowan provided his contact information on the form, as well as contact information for Dr. Hu.\n   <footnotemark>\n    5\n   </footnotemark>\n   (10/25/17 Bancroft Decl. \u00b6 11, Ex. C at 6.)\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-24\">\n   During his deposition, Dr. Cowan conceded that the 2007\n   <em>\n    Cancer\n   </em>\n   publication is the only medical literature he relied upon to support his 24-month life expectancy estimate. (Cowan Dep. at 56:24-57:5.) He also acknowledged that the 2007 study \"could be\" outdated and that at least one of the treatments that Mr. Bancroft received was not available during the applicable time period of the 2007 study. (\n   <em>\n    Id.\n   </em>\n   at 58:3-25; 59:8-14.) Dr. Cowan testified that the reason, in part, that he relied on the 2007 study rather than Mr. Bancroft's MIPI score was due to Mr. Bancroft's high white blood cell count and LDH. (\n   <em>\n    Id.\n   </em>\n   at 55:13-56:4.) Yet, Dr. Cowan admitted that these factors are accounted for as part of the MIPI score. (\n   <em>\n    Id.\n   </em>\n   at 56:10-12.) Dr. Cowan also stated that chromosomal changes, such as the deletion of 17p (long arm chromosome 17), was a factor that put Mr. Bancroft at high risk. (\n   <em>\n    Id.\n   </em>\n   at 55:13-56:4; 10/25/17 Cowan Decl. \u00b6 6.) Yet, Dr. Cowan also admitted in his deposition that a 2011 publication in the Journal of Leukemia \"certainly ... call[s] into question whether 17p deletions are important.\" (Cowan Dep. at 65:11-67:4;\n   <em>\n    see also\n   </em>\n   Grinblatt Decl. \u00b6 7.) Dr. Cowan acknowledged that his 24 month estimate for Mr. Bancroft life expectancy was a deviation from the MIPI score prognosis, but he stated that life expectancy estimation is \"not a perfect science,\" and he tries \"to be more realistic and maybe a bit paranoid and pessimistic rather than overly optimistic.\" (Cowan Dep. at 61:3-18.)\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-25\">\n   Mr. Bancroft does not recall Dr. Cowan advising him that his life expectancy was 24 months or less. (5/7/18 Marisseau Decl. \u00b6 5, Ex. 1 (\"Bancroft Dep.\") at 87:8-88:16.) Rather, Mr. Bancroft repeatedly described Dr. Cowan as \"very encouraging\" or \"very positive.\" (\n   <em>\n    Id.\n   </em>\n   at 44:3-5; 46:1-5.) Indeed, in contrast to the 24-month median survival\n   prognosis that Dr. Cowan provided to Minnesota Life, Dr. Cowan advised Mr. Bancroft in February 2017 that \"the median overall survival [for] mantle cell lymphoma is about 5-7 years ... but with new intensive treatments ... many patients are living much longer.\" (Cowan Dep. at 18:19-19:5.) Mr. Bancroft testified that he \"[a]bsolutely\" expected Dr. Cowan to provide him with accurate information concerning overall median survival so that he could make informed decisions about treatment options (Bancroft Dep. at 45:16-21), and Dr. Cowan testified that his statement to Mr. Bancroft was accurate at the time he gave it. (Cowan Dep. at 19:11-14).\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-26\">\n   <strong>\n    D. Minnesota Life's Initial Review of Mr. Bancroft's Claim\n   </strong>\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-27\">\n   Upon receipt of Mr. Bancroft's claim, Minnesota Life forwarded the claim to its medical reviewer, Dr. Maryam Shapland, for an evaluation of Mr. Bancroft's prognosis. (\n   <em>\n    See\n   </em>\n   11/13/17 Shapland Decl. \u00b6 7.) Dr. Shapland limited her review to the notes of Minnesota Life's claims examiner, Ms. Sarah Taylor, and Dr. Cowan's Attending Physician's Statement. (4/19/18 Crowe Decl. \u00b6 3 (attaching excerpts of the March 28, 2018, deposition of Dr. Shapland) (\"Shapland Dep.\") at 31:13-20.) She also reviewed \"Up to Date,\" a resource that provides information and current scientific articles on various medical conditions, including mantle cell lymphoma. (\n   <em>\n    Id.\n   </em>\n   at 52:9-55:6; 5/7/18 Shapland Decl. (Dkt. # 38) \u00b6 2.) The Up to Date article that Dr. Shapland reviewed further referred to an article in a publication known as\n   <em>\n    Blood.\n   </em>\n   (Shapland Dep. at 52:9-55:6.) The\n   <em>\n    Blood\n   </em>\n   article consists of the first published information on the MIPI score. (\n   <em>\n    Id.\n   </em>\n   ; Cowan Dep. at 13:9-12.) Dr. Shapland did not read the\n   <em>\n    Blood\n   </em>\n   article, but relied instead on the information Up to Date conveyed about that article. (Shapland Dep. at 52:9-55:6.)\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-28\">\n   The MIPI score is a \"well-recognized evidence based prognostic index for patients with mantle cell lymphoma.\" (11/13/17 Shapland Decl. \u00b6 8.) A physician can determine an MIPI score for any individual diagnosed with mantle cell lymphoma based on four independent factors: age, ECOG performance status, lactate dehydrogenase (\"LDH\") (which is a cell enzyme), and leukocyte count (which is also known as white blood cell count). (\n   <em>\n    Id.\n   </em>\n   \u00b6 9; Grinblatt Decl. (Dkt. # 37) \u00b6 5;\n   <em>\n    see also\n   </em>\n   Cowan Dep. at 13:13-18.) A biologic MIPI score includes those same four factors but also includes analysis of Ki-67 positive cells, a marker for proliferation or how fast a tumor is growing that has independent prognostic value when considered with the MIPI score. (11/13/17 Shapland Decl. \u00b6 9; Grinblatt Decl. \u00b6 6; Cowan Dep. at 16:2-19.) The MIPI, including the biologic MIPI, takes into account all the characteristics of the disease at issue that have been confirmed to have a statistically significant effect on prognosis. (Grinblatt Decl. \u00b6 6; Cowan Dep. at 16:2-19.)\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-29\">\n   An MIPI score from 6-12 is considered a high-risk MIPI score. (11/13/17 Shapland Decl. \u00b6 10.) Mr. Bancroft's attending physician, Dr. Cowan, scored Mr. Bancroft at 7.2. (\n   <em>\n    Id.\n   </em>\n   ; 10/25/17 Bancroft Decl. \u00b6 11, Ex. C at 5.) The 2008\n   <em>\n    Blood\n   </em>\n   article indicated that patients with a high-risk MIPI score had a median overall survival of 29 months and patients with a high-risk biologic MIPI score had a median overall survival of 37 months.\n   <footnotemark>\n    6\n   </footnotemark>\n   (11/13/17 Shapland Decl. \u00b6 11.) Thus, based on his score, the high-risk biologic MIPI predicted a median\n   overall survival of 37 months for individuals such as Mr. Bancroft. (\n   <em>\n    See id.\n   </em>\n   ; Grinblatt Decl. \u00b6 6;\n   <em>\n    see also\n   </em>\n   10/25/17 Cowan Decl. \u00b6 13 (\"The letter provided by Minnesota Life also refers to a life expectancy of 37 months being the 'median survival' expected of Mr. Bancroft. I presume that this was taken from ...\n   <em>\n    Blood\n   </em>\n   2008-using the biologic MIPI, which is not as widely used as the MIPI score.\") (italics added).) Dr. Shapland also considered Dr. Cowan's statement on the Attending Physician's Statement that Mr. Bancroft was responding to treatment, his notation that Mr. Bancroft's condition was \"[i]mproved,\" and his expectation that Mr. Bancroft will continue to experience \"fundamental or marked\" \"[i]mprovement.\" (\n   <em>\n    See\n   </em>\n   10/25/17 Bancroft Decl. \u00b6 11, Ex. C at 6.) Dr. Shapland did not ask for any additional medical records or information from Dr. Cowan, although she recognized that she had the ability to do so. (Shapland Dep. at 66:10-67:4.)\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-30\">\n   Based on her review of Dr. Cowan's Attending Physician's Statement and the medical information in Up to Date, Dr. Shapland opined that she was \"unable to determine with greater than 90% certainty that [Mr. Bancroft's] life expectancy is 24 months or less.\" (4/19/18 Crowe Decl. \u00b6 3, Ex. 22 (attaching claim journal entries from Minnesota Life for Mr. Bancroft's claim).) As Minnesota Life explained:\n  </p>\n  <blockquote id=\"p-31\">\n   The 90% confidence in a life expectancy of 24 months or less is a standard applied at Minnesota Life. It is based on the policy provision that provides that Minnesota Life \"must be given evidence that satisfies us that the insured's life expectancy, because of accident or sickness, is twenty four months or less.\"\n  </blockquote>\n  <blockquote id=\"p-32\">\n   * * * * * * * * * * * * *\n  </blockquote>\n  <blockquote id=\"p-33\">\n   As noted, Dr. Shapland was orally advised of Minnesota Life's policy that she should apply a 90% level of confidence in determining the level of satisfactory evidence to determine life expectancy, rather than 100%.\n  </blockquote>\n  <p id=\"p-34\">\n   (4/19/18 Crowe Decl. \u00b6 3, Ex. 32 at 7, 9.) Nevertheless, Dr. Shapland testified that whether she applied a \"more likely than not\" or a \"90% certainty\" standard to the evidence relating to Mr. Bancroft's life expectancy, her opinion would be the same. (5/7/18 Shapland Decl. \u00b6 10.) She also testified that she believes both her opinion and Dr. Cowan's prognosis are reasonable. (Shapland Dep. at 71:14-17 (\"I feel that my opinion was reasonable, and [Dr. Cowan's] opinion was reasonable.... There's no exact way to determine exact life expectancy.\").)\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-35\">\n   Dr. Cowan testified that he put Mr. Bancroft's MIPI score into his medical notes because \"it conveys information about risk and prognosis.\" (Cowan Dep. at 13:2.) He agreed that the MIPI prognostic index was first validated in the 2008\n   <em>\n    Blood\n   </em>\n   article and then confirmed again in a later 2014 study. (\n   <em>\n    Id.\n   </em>\n   at 13:3-12; 15:1-16:1, Ex. 3.) Although Dr. Cowan believed that his 24-month prognosis for Mr. Bancroft in the Attending Physician's Statement was reasonable, he agreed that either the 29-month non-biologic MIPI or the 37-month biologic MIPI was a reasonable estimate of Mr. Bancroft's life expectancy at the time.\n   <footnotemark>\n    7\n   </footnotemark>\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-36\">\n   Minnesota Life retained an expert witness, Dr. David Grinblatt, M.D., who specializes in blood cancers.\n   <footnotemark>\n    8\n   </footnotemark>\n   Dr. Grinblatt agrees with Dr. Shapland that the median overall survival rate for Mr. Bancroft was 37 months at the time of his claim based on the standard biologic MIPI. (Grinblatt Decl. \u00b6 6.) Further, he opines:\n  </p>\n  <blockquote id=\"p-37\">\n   The biologic MIPI, when available, is the standard prognostic metric for mantle cell lymphoma. The MIPI, including the biologic MIPI, takes into account all of the characteristics of this disease which have been validated to have a statistically significant effect on prognosis. It is the fairest, most objective measure for determining prognosis for mantle cell lymphoma. The MIPI, including biologic MIPI, remains the best and only validated method to assess survival in patients with Mantle Cell Lymphoma.\n  </blockquote>\n  <p id=\"p-38\">\n   (\n   <em>\n    Id.\n   </em>\n   ) He also notes that \"it was reasonable to determine that Mr. Bancroft had a median life expectancy of greater than 24 months as of May 2017, based on his February diagnosis.\" (\n   <em>\n    Id.\n   </em>\n   \u00b6 10.)\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-39\">\n   <strong>\n    E. Minnesota Life's Initial Response to Mr. Bancroft's Claim.\n   </strong>\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-40\">\n   After receiving Dr. Shapland's opinion, Minnesota Life's claims examiner, Ms. Taylor, sent a letter dated June 8, 2017, to Mr. Bancroft containing the following statement:\n  </p>\n  <blockquote id=\"p-41\">\n   With the information we received from your doctor, we are unable to determine, at this time, if your life expectancy will be less than 24 months, which the policy requires.

Minnesota Life admits that it received Mr. Bancroft's 20-day IFCA notice (Compl. \u00b6 44; Ans. \u00b6 44) but did not respond within the 20-day notice period (4/19/18 Crowe Decl. \u00b6 2).\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-46\">\n   Mr. Bancroft filed suit against Minnesota Life in King County Superior Court on August 2, 2017.

Minnesota Life removed the action to this court on August 30, 2017. (Notice of Rem. (Dkt. # 1).)\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-47\">\n   On October 25, 2017, Mr. Bancroft filed an early motion for summary judgment. (Plf. 1st MSJ (Dkt. # 7).) Along with his motion, Mr. Bancroft filed a declaration from Dr. Cowan dated October 19, 2017. (\n   <em>\n    See\n   </em>\n   10/25/17 Cowan Decl.) Pursuant to Federal Rule of Civil Procedure 56(d), the court denied the motion without prejudice to refiling, if appropriate, after Minnesota Life had an opportunity obtain discovery.

Dr. Shapland's Second Review of Mr. Bancroft's Claim\n   </strong>\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-49\">\n   After receiving Dr. Cowan's October 19, 2017, declaration, Dr. Shapland reevaluated Mr. Bancroft's life expectancy as of November 1, 2017. (5/7/18 Shapland Decl. \u00b6\u00b6 8-9.) She reviewed additional medical literature, which she concluded supported her original opinion. (\n   <em>\n    Id.\n   </em>\n   \u00b6 8; 4/19/18 Crowe Decl. \u00b6 3, Ex. 22 at 1.) She noted that in his declaration, Dr. Cowan \"acknowledged that the median survival using the biologic MIPI with a high risk MIPI score was 37 months and that using the non-biologic\n   MIPI with a high risk MIPI score provided a median survival of 29 months 'for individuals with similar factors as Mr. Bancroft.' \" (5/7/18 Shapland Decl. \u00b6 8 (quoting 10/25/17 Cowan Decl. \u00b6 13).) Dr. Shapland interpreted Dr. Cowan's statement to mean that he was confirming that Mr. Bancroft shared similarities with individuals who had a median survival of 29 months using the non-biologic MIPI. (\n   <em>\n    See id.\n   </em>\n   ) Dr. Shapland also interpreted Dr. Cowan's declaration as suggesting that Mr. Bancroft had experienced a negative reaction to treatment. (\n   <em>\n    Id.\n   </em>\n   \u00b6 9.) Mr. Bancroft also testified in October 2017 that he had experienced \"severe reactions\" to some of his treatments and that Dr. Cowan had needed to adjust his treatments accordingly. (\n   <em>\n    See\n   </em>\n   10/25/17 Bancroft Decl. \u00b6 8.) Due to the passage of nearly five additional months since her original opinion in early June 2017, her acceptance of Dr. Cowan's October 2017 statement \"that individuals with similar factors as Mr. Bancroft\" had a (non-biologic) MIPI prognosis of 29 months, her inference that the \"marked\" improvement anticipated by Dr. Cowan had not occurred, and the fact that Mr. Bancroft may have taken a turn for the worse or there may have been negative developments in Mr. Bancroft's treatment, Dr. Bancroft used the 29-month median survival (non-biologic MIPI) and determined based on a 90% certainty standard that as of November 1, 2017, Mr. Bancroft's life expectancy was 24 months or less. (5/7/18 Shapland Decl. \u00b6 9; Shapland Dep. at 108:3-122:6.) Minnesota Life paid Mr. Bancroft $384,000.00 the next day. (Plf. 2d MSJ at 12; Def. MSJ at 10.)\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-50\">\n   <strong>\n    III. ANALYSIS\n   </strong>\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-51\">\n   On April 19, 2018, Mr. Bancroft filed a second motion for summary judgment on liability for his claims of (1) breach of contract; (2) bad faith; (3) breach of Washington's IFCA; and (4) breach of Washington's CPA. (\n   <em>\n    See generally\n   </em>\n   Plf. 2d MSJ.) On May 7, 2018, Minnesota Life filed its response to Mr. Bancroft's motion and a cross motion for summary judgment in its favor. (\n   <em>\n    See generally\n   </em>\n   Def MSJ.) The court considers both motions after resolving an evidentiary issue.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-52\">\n   <strong>\n    A. Admissibility of Don Kelley's Expert Testimony\n   </strong>\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-53\">\n   The court first addresses a preliminary issue concerning the admissibility of certain evidence. In its reply memorandum, Minnesota Life objects to the admissibility of Mr. Don Kelley's opinions and testimony. (Def. Reply (Dkt. # 49) at 5-6.) Mr. Kelley is Mr. Bancroft's expert witness on insurance issues. (\n   <em>\n    See\n   </em>\n   Kelley Decl. (Dkt. # 48) \u00b6 2, Ex. J (attaching Mr. Kelley's expert witness report).) In response to Minnesota Life's objection, Mr. Bancroft filed a surreply arguing that Minnesota Life's request to exclude Mr. Kelley's testimony \"was improperly presented in reply and otherwise in violation of the local rules.\" (Plf. Surreply (Dkt. # 51) at 1.) Mr. Bancroft maintains that he had an inadequate opportunity to respond to Minnesota Life's objection. (\n   <em>\n    See id.\n   </em>\n   )\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-54\">\n   Before considering the admissibility of Mr. Kelley's testimony, the court first addresses Mr. Bancroft's procedural objection. Local Rule LCR 7(d)(4) states that \"[e]xcept upon a showing of good cause, any motion in limine shall be filed as one motion.\" Local Rules W.D. Wash. LCR 7(d)(4). Mr. Bancroft apparently objects that Minnesota Life did not file its objection to Mr. Kelley's testimony in a separate omnibus motion containing all of its motions in limine as required by this local rule. (\n   <em>\n    See\n   </em>\n   Plf. Surreply at 1.) However, Local Rule LCR 7 begins with the following proviso: \"Unless otherwise provided by rule or court order, motions shall be noted for consideration as follows.\"\n   <em>\n    Id.\n   </em>\n   , LCR 7. Thus, the directive in Local Rule\n   7(d)(4) that all motions in limine shall be filed as one motion, is cabined by the proviso-\"[u]nless otherwise provided by ... court order.\"\n   <em>\n    See id.\n   </em>\n   Here, the court expressly separated motions objecting to expert witness testimony from all other motions in limine in its scheduling order. (\n   <em>\n    See\n   </em>\n   Sched. Order (Dkt. # 20) at 1.) The court's scheduling order requires parties to file all dispositive motions and motions challenging expert witness testimony by July 11, 2018, but all other motions in limine by August 28, 2018. (\n   <em>\n    Id.\n   </em>\n   ) Thus, although it was not filed as a separate motion, Minnesota Life's June 1, 2018, objection to Mr. Kelley's testimony was timely and not improperly segregated from Minnesota Life's other motions in limine.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-55\">\n   Mr. Bancroft also objects that Minnesota Life raised its challenge to Mr. Kelley's testimony for the first time in its reply memorandum. (Plf. Surreply at 1.) Mr. Bancroft, however, did not rely upon Mr. Kelley's testimony until his third memorandum addressing the parties' cross motions. (\n   <em>\n    See\n   </em>\n   Plf. Resp. (Dkt. # 46) at 4, 11, 17 n.15, 24.) Thus, Minnesota Life's first opportunity to address the admissibility of Mr. Kelley's expert opinions was in its reply memorandum. (\n   <em>\n    See\n   </em>\n   Def. Reply at 5-6).\n   <footnotemark>\n    11\n   </footnotemark>\n   \"A trial court can only consider admissible evidence in ruling on a motion for summary judgment.\"\n   <em>\n    Orr v.

Thus, it was substantively proper for Minnesota Life to raise its objections to the admissibility of Mr. Kelley's expert testimony in response to Mr. Bancroft's reliance thereon.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-56\">\n   In any event, Mr. Bancroft is not prejudiced by the manner in which Minnesota Life raised its objection. Mr. Bancroft filed a surreply and therefore had the opportunity to address Minnesota Life's objection. (\n   <em>\n    See\n   </em>\n   Plf. Surreply.) Further, Mr. Bancroft provided the entire transcript of Mr. Kelley's deposition testimony to the court (\n   <em>\n    see\n   </em>\n   6/4/18 Frost Decl. (Dkt. # 52) \u00b6 2, Ex. A (attaching a transcript of Mr. Kelley's deposition);\n   <em>\n    see also\n   </em>\n   Plf. Surreply at 1 (\"To any extent the Court considers defendant's request to exclude Mr. Kelley's testimony, the Court should have full opportunity to review Mr. Kelley's full deposition testimony as the excerpts provided by [Minnesota Life] are incomplete and/or misleading as to Mr. Kelley's full testimony provided.\") ), and the court has reviewed it. Further, the court specifically notified the parties to be \"prepared to address the admissibility of the opinions and testimony\" of Mr. Kelley at oral argument. (\n   <em>\n    See\n   </em>\n   7/10/18 Order (Dkt. # 60).) Mr. Bancroft's counsel addressed the issue orally and provided the court with a hand-out highlighting areas of Mr. Kelley's expert opinion report that Mr. Bancroft's counsel concedes are not admissible. (\n   <em>\n    See\n   </em>\n   Report (Dkt. # 63).) Accordingly, Mr. Bancroft has had \"ample opportunity\" to address Minnesota Life's objections (Plf. Surreply at 1), and he is not prejudiced by the court's consideration of the issue.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-57\">\n   The court now turns to the substance of Minnesota Life's objection. Minnesota Life's objections to Mr. Kelley's testimony fall into two categories. First, Minnesota Life argues that Mr. Kelley is not qualified to critique various medical opinions as he\n   does. (Def. Reply at 5-6.) Second, Minnesota Life objects that Mr. Kelley's expert opinion report is replete with legal conclusions that are not helpful to the trier of fact. (\n   <em>\n    Id.\n   </em>\n   )\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-58\">\n   Federal Rule of Evidence 702 requires that a prospective witness be \"qualified as an expert by knowledge, skill, experience, training, or education[.]\" Fed.

The Ninth Circuit has defined this as the threshold issue in determining whether a witness may come \"before the jury cloaked with the mantle of an expert\" under Rule 702, and has cautioned that \"care must be taken to assure that a proffered witness truly qualifies as an expert, and that such testimony meets the requirements of Rule 702.\"\n   <em>\n    Jinro Am.

Thus, the Ninth Circuit has expressly stated that expert testimony from an attorney \"cannot be used to provide legal meaning or interpret ... [insurance] policies as written.\"\n   <em>\n    <extracted-citation case-ids=\"1381173\" index=\"5\" url=\"https://cite.case.law/f3d/164/451/#p454\">\n     Id.\n    </extracted-citation>\n   </em>\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-59\">\n   The lion's share of Mr. Kelley's expert opinion consists of his critique of Dr. Shapland's medical opinion and her review of the medical literature underpinning her opinion and his analysis of Dr. Cowan's prognosis for Mr. Bancroft and the medical literature underpinning that prognosis. (\n   <em>\n    See\n   </em>\n   Kelley Decl. \u00b6 2, Ex. J at 7-9.) But Mr. Kelley is not a medical doctor and asserts no medical expertise. (\n   <em>\n    Id.\n   </em>\n   at 1.) Instead, he is an attorney who specializes in insurance matters. (\n   <em>\n    Id.\n   </em>\n   ) Indeed, Mr. Bancroft's counsel admitted during oral argument that Mr. Kelley has no medical qualifications. Mr. Kelley is, therefore, unqualified to opine on the adequacy of either Dr. Shapland's or Dr. Cowan's medical opinions or the adequacy of their review of the medical literature.\n   <em>\n    See, e.g.\n   </em>\n   ,\n   <em>\n    Nguyen v.

(\n   <em>\n    See\n   </em>\n   Report.) Mr. Bancroft's counsel conceded that the highlighted portions of Mr. Kelley's expert report are not admissible. (\n   <em>\n    See\n    <extracted-citation case-ids=\"1871554\" index=\"8\" url=\"https://cite.case.law/f2d/972/1183/#p1194\">\n     id.\n    </extracted-citation>\n   </em>\n   ) Mr. Kelley's first opinion is that \"Minnesota Life failed to conduct a reasonable investigation of the relevant available information before denying [Mr.] Bancroft's claim.\" (\n   <em>\n    Id.\n   </em>\n   at 7.) Mr. Bancroft concedes that the first paragraph of the analysis supporting this opinion is inadmissible. (\n   <em>\n    Id.\n   </em>\n   at 7-8.) The court, however, excludes the entire portion of the report underpinning this opinion. The entire analysis behind this opinion is intertwined with Mr. Kelley's improper evaluation of Dr. Cowan's and Dr. Shapland's medical opinions. Indeed, Mr. Kelley even includes this remarkable admission: \"As a lay person, not particularly trained in medicine, I would think that a person taking the cocktail of medications [Mr.] Bancroft was taking would be expected to improve.\" (\n   <em>\n    Id.\n   </em>\n   at 8.) In this statement, Mr. Kelley acknowledges his complete lack of medical expertise. Because his opinion concerning the adequacy\n   of Minnesota Life's investigation is entwined with his analysis of Dr. Shapland's and Dr. Cowan's medical opinions, he is not qualified to offer the opinion at issue. Accordingly, the court excludes Mr. Kelley's first opinion.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-61\">\n   Mr. Kelley's second opinion is that \"Minnesota Life failed to fairly and objectively interpret the information it received before denying [Mr.] Bancroft's claim.\" (\n   <em>\n    Id.\n   </em>\n   at 8.) Mr. Bancroft's counsel concedes that the first paragraph of Mr. Kelley's analysis underlying this opinion, which contains Mr. Kelley's evaluation of Dr. Shapland's and Dr. Cowan's medical opinions, is inadmissible. (\n   <em>\n    See\n   </em>\n   <em>\n    id.\n   </em>\n   at 8-9.) Mr. Kelley's entire opinion, however, concerning Minnesota Life's interpretation of the information at issue is entangled with his analysis of the doctors' medical opinions and cannot be divorced from it. (\n   <em>\n    See id.\n   </em>\n   ) The court, therefore, excludes the entire opinion.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-62\">\n   Mr. Kelley's third opinion is that \"Minnesota Life failed to administer [Mr.] Bancroft's claim in accordance with the express provisions of his Policy and in accordance with the insurance industry custom and practice.\" (\n   <em>\n    Id.\n   </em>\n   at 9.) Mr. Bancroft's counsel again concedes that the majority of this opinion is inadmissible. (\n   <em>\n    See\n   </em>\n   <em>\n    id.\n   </em>\n   at 9-10.) Indeed, the analysis underlying Mr. Kelley's opinion consists extensively of how he believes the Policy and ABPR should be interpreted. (\n   <em>\n    See id.\n   </em>\n   ) As discussed above, expert testimony from an attorney cannot be used to provide legal meaning or interpret insurance policies; policy interpretation is an issue of law for the court.\n   <em>\n    See\n   </em>\n   <em>\n    McHugh\n   </em>\n   ,\n   <extracted-citation case-ids=\"1381173\" index=\"9\" url=\"https://cite.case.law/f3d/164/451/#p454\">\n    164 F.3d at 454\n   </extracted-citation>\n   . The court concludes that the remainder of the analysis underlying Mr. Kelley's opinion is also inadmissible. Once again, Mr. Kelley's analysis is based on the adequacy of Dr. Shapland's medical opinion, and as discussed above, he is unqualified to perform this analysis.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-63\">\n   Mr. Kelley's fourth opinion is that \"Minnesota Life misrepresented a critical fact as the basis for denying [Mr.] Bancroft's claim.\" (Report at 11.) Mr. Bancroft's attorney believes that this opinion and its supporting analysis is admissible. (\n   <em>\n    See\n    <extracted-citation case-ids=\"1381173\" index=\"10\" url=\"https://cite.case.law/f3d/164/451/#p454\">\n     id.\n    </extracted-citation>\n   </em>\n   ) The court, however, disagrees. Mr. Kelley's opinion is based entirely on his assessment of Dr. Shapland's analysis of the medical literature underpinning her medical opinions in this case. As repeatedly stated above, he is unqualified as a lawyer without medical training to conduct this analysis.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-64\">\n   Mr. Kelley states his final opinion as follows: \"For all the above reasons, it is my opinion that Minnesota Life failed to give [Mr.] Bancroft's interests as much consideration as they did their own.\" (\n   <em>\n    Id.\n   </em>\n   ) Because the court has excluded all of Mr. Bancroft's prior opinions either because he lacks the necessary medical expertise or because he offers legal opinions or interpretations of the Policy or ABPR, there is no basis or foundation remaining to undergird this last opinion. Accordingly, the court finds that his last opinion is inadmissible as well. In sum, the court excludes the entirety of Mr. Kelley's opinions.

Nevertheless, the court recognizes that when an insured has a contractual right that depends on the insured's furnishing of evidence or proof which is \"satisfactory to the company\" or \"satisfies\" the company, the weight of authority applies an objective standard.\n   <em>\n    See\n   </em>\n   29 John Alan Appleman,\n   <em>\n    Appleman on Insurance\n   </em>\n   , \u00a7 179.03[D][4] (2d ed. 2006).

Even assuming the application of a standard higher than the one articulated in\n   <em>\n    Conway\n   </em>\n   , however, there is no genuine dispute of material fact that Minnesota Life did not breach the contract by provisionally denying Mr. Bancroft's claim on June 8, 2017.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-78\">\n   Minnesota Life provisionally denied Mr. Bancroft's claim because Dr. Cowan relied upon an obsolete study in opining that Mr. Bancroft had a life-expectancy of 24 months or less and ignored a more recent and scientifically sound measure-Mr. Bancroft's MIPI score.\n   <em>\n    See infra\n   </em>\n   \u00a7\u00a7 II.C, D. Further, even Dr. Cowan-Mr. Bancroft's treating oncologist-concedes that reasonable estimates of Mr. Bancroft's life expectancy could be calculated by using either the 29-month non-biologic MIPI or the 37-month biologic MIPI. (Cowan Dep. at 61:19-62:2; 62:24-63:8.) Indeed, all of the medical experts in this case-Mr. Bancroft's treating physician, Minnesota Life's reviewing doctor, and Minnesota Life's medical expert witness-agree on this point.\n   <footnotemark>\n    14\n   </footnotemark>\n   (\n   <em>\n    See\n    <extracted-citation index=\"45\" url=\"https://cite.case.law/citations/?q=196%20P.3d%20664\">\n     id.\n    </extracted-citation>\n   </em>\n   ;\n   <em>\n    see also\n   </em>\n   Grinblatt Decl.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-79\">\n   \u00b6\u00b6 6, 10; Shapland Dep. at 71:14-17.) Moreover, Mr. Bancroft provides no expert medical testimony to the contrary. Thus, Minnesota Life had objective reasons to deny an accelerated payment of Mr. Bancroft's life insurance benefits on June 8, 2017. The most recent medical literature did not support Dr. Cowan's prognosis of a life expectancy of 24 months or less, and Mr. Bancroft's MIPI score indicated that his life expectancy was longer than 24 months. Thus, even considering the policy language at issue-that Mr. Bancroft must submit \"evidence that satisfies\" Minnesota Life-under the standard of a reasonable insurer, there is no genuine dispute of material fact that Minnesota Life did not breach the ABPR by provisionally denying Mr. Bancroft's claim on June 8, 2017.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-80\">\n   Mr. Bancroft nevertheless asserts that Dr. Shapland's adoption of the 29-month non-biologic MIPI for calculating Mr. Bancroft's life expectancy when she re-evaluated his claim in November 2017, is evidence that Minnesota Life breached the ABPR when it denied his claim on June 8, 2017. (Plf. Reply at 3 (citing Shapland Dep. at 109:18-110:13).) Mr. Bancroft argues that if Minnesota Life had applied the non-biologic MIPI in June, when it first assessed Mr. Bancroft's claim, it would have concluded that Mr. Bancroft's life expectancy was 24 months or less. (\n   <em>\n    Id.\n   </em>\n   ) However, Mr. Bancroft's argument is based on faulty arithmetic. Mr. Bancroft admits that he was diagnosed on February 1, 2017.\n   <footnotemark>\n    15\n   </footnotemark>\n   Thus, using the 29-month non-biologic MIPI score, at the time Dr. Cowan signed the Attending Physician's Statement on May 26, 2017, or at the time Minnesota Life denied Mr. Bancroft's claim on June 8, 2017, Mr. Bancroft would not have had a life expectancy of 24 months or less. As of May 26, 2017, Mr. Bancroft would have had a life expectancy slightly greater than 25 months; on June 8, 2017, his life expectancy would have been slightly less than 25 months.\n   <footnotemark>\n    16\n   </footnotemark>\n   But in either event, it would have been more than twenty-four months. (\n   <em>\n    See\n   </em>\n   11/06/17 Marisseau\n   Decl. \u00b6 4, Ex. A.) Thus, Dr. Shapland's adoption of the 29-month non-biologic MIPI score in November 2017 does not raise a genuine dispute of material fact concerning Mr. Bancroft's breach of contract claim preventing the entry of summary judgment in Minnesota Life's favor.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-81\">\n   Mr. Bancroft, however, also takes umbrage with Minnesota Life's application of a \"90% confidence\" or \"90% certainty\" factor in assessing its insureds' life expectancy and implies that Minnesota Life's use of this factor violates its duty to give \"equal consideration in all matters\" to Mr. Bancroft's interests. (\n   <em>\n    See\n   </em>\n   Plf. 2d MSJ at 14; Plf. Reply at 3; Plf. Resp. at 17-18);\n   <em>\n    see\n   </em>\n   <em>\n    Van Noy\n   </em>\n   ,\n   <extracted-citation index=\"46\" url=\"https://cite.case.law/citations/?q=16%20P.3d%20574\">\n    16 P.3d at 579\n   </extracted-citation>\n   . Instead, Mr. Bancroft asserts that Minnesota Life and Dr. Shapland should have applied a \"more likely than not standard.\" (\n   <em>\n    See\n   </em>\n   Plf. 2d MSJ at 14; Plf. Reply at 5-8; Plf. Resp. at 15-18.) Mr. Bancroft, however, fails to raise a genuine dispute of material fact preventing the entry of summary judgment in Minnesota Life's favor because Dr. Shapland testified that-irrespective of whether she applied the \"90% certainty\" standard or a \"more likely than not\" standard, her opinion concerning Mr. Bancroft's life expectancy would be the same. (5/7/18 Shapland Decl. \u00b6 10 (\"In looking at whether the evidence presented in the May 26 claim showed that Mr. Bancroft's life expectancy was 24 months or less, my opinion is the same regardless of whether ... I apply a 'more likely than not' or a 90% certainty standard.\").) Mr. Bancroft has not provided any medical testimony to counter Dr. Shapland's testimony in this regard. (\n   <em>\n    See generally\n   </em>\n   Dkt.) The court does not hold that Minnesota Life was required to apply a \"more likely than not\" standard. But, even if Mr. Bancroft is correct, the application of a \"more likely than not\" standard would have made no difference here. Thus, Mr. Bancroft's objection to the \"90% certainty\" factor does not raise a genuine dispute of material fact prohibiting the court's entry of summary judgment in Minnesota Life's favor on his breach of contract claim concerning this clause of the ABPR.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-82\">\n   In any event, as discussed above, the policy language plainly stated that Mr. Bancroft had to submit \"evidence that satisfies [Minnesota Life]\" of his life expectancy. (11/06/17 Marisseau Decl. \u00b6 4, Ex. A at ML 0037.) Thus, Minnesota Life's application of a \"90% confidence\" or a \"90% certainty\" factor was not a violation of the terms of the contract-particularly where Mr. Bancroft's own oncologist agreed that use of Mr. Bancroft's MIPI score for estimating his life expectancy, as Dr. Shapland did, was reasonable. (\n   <em>\n    See\n   </em>\n   Cowan Dep. at 61:19-62:2; 62:24-63:8.)\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-83\">\n   In sum, the court grants Minnesota Life's motion for summary judgment on Mr. Bancroft's claim for breach of contract concerning the ABPR's clause requiring evidence satisfying Minnesota Life that Mr. Bancroft's life expectancy is 24 months or less. The court denies Mr. Bancroft's motion for summary judgment with respect to the same clause.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-84\">\n   2.\n   <em>\n    Minnesota Life's Right to Obtain an Independent Medical Examination and Mr. Bancroft's Right to Alternative Dispute Resolution\n   </em>\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-85\">\n   Mr. Bancroft also argues that Minnesota Life breached the ABPR by \"refus[ing] to conduct an 'independent medical verification' or to allow for any sort of alternative dispute resolution prior to denying [Mr.] Bancroft's claim.\" (Plf. 2d MSJ at 14;\n   <em>\n    see also\n   </em>\n   Plf.

MSJ at 15-16.)\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-86\">\n   The court begins with the language of the ABPR, which states in relevant part:\n  </p>\n  <blockquote id=\"p-87\">\n   <strong>\n    Do we retain the right to obtain independent medical verification?\n   </strong>\n  </blockquote>\n  <blockquote id=\"p-88\">\n   Yes.

(\n   <em>\n    Id.\n   </em>\n   ) Because the policy language is clear and unambiguous, the court enforces it as written.\n   <em>\n    See\n   </em>\n   <em>\n    Quadrant Corp.\n   </em>\n   , 110 P.3d at 737 (\"Most importantly, if the policy language is clear and unambiguous, we must enforce it as written; we may not modify it or create ambiguity where none exists.\"). Thus, to the extent that Mr. Bancroft asserts that he is entitled to summary judgment because Minnesota Life violated the ABPR by \"refus[ing] to conduct an 'independent medical verification' \" (Plf. 2d MSJ at 18), the court denies Mr. Bancroft's motion and grants summary judgment to Minnesota Life on that issue.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-92\">\n   Mr. Bancroft, however, also argues that Minnesota Life breached the ABPR by failing to allow him to engage in mediation or arbitration over the dispute between Dr. Cowan and Dr. Shapland concerning the length of his life expectancy. (Plf. 2d MSJ at 14-15.) Minnesota Life argues that Mr. Bancroft's right to mediation or arbitration arises only in the event that Minnesota Life seeks an independent medical verification and that doctor's opinion is in conflict with the insured's doctor's opinion. (Def. MSJ at 15.) Because it did not seek independent medical verification of Mr. Bancroft's condition, Minnesota Life argues that it had no obligation to engage in alternative dispute resolution with Mr. Bancroft. (\n   <em>\n    See id.\n   </em>\n   )\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-93\">\n   The court agrees with Mr. Bancroft that, under the plain language of the ABPR, Mr. Bancroft's right to alternative dispute resolution was not contingent upon Minnesota Life's invocation of its right for an independent medical examination of Mr. Bancroft. In this case, Dr. Cowan and Dr. Shapland had a \"difference of opinion,\" and this difference alone triggered Mr. Bancroft's \"right to mediation or binding arbitration conducted by a disinterested third party\" under the ABPR. (\n   <em>\n    See\n   </em>\n   10/25/17 Bancroft Decl. \u00b6 16, Ex. A at 12.) The problem with Mr. Bancroft's claim for breach of this provision, however, is that he never invoked his right or informed Minnesota Life that he would like to mediate or arbitrate. Indeed, his counsel admitted during oral argument that Mr. Bancroft never asked for mediation or any other kind of alternative dispute resolution. Instead, upon receiving Minnesota Life's June 8, 2017, letter, Mr. Bancroft hired counsel, sent a 20-day IFCA notice dated June 22, 2017, to Minnesota Life (\n   <em>\n    see\n   </em>\n   10/25/17 Frost Decl. (Dkt. # 22) \u00b6 2, Ex. E), and filed suit on August 2, 2017 (\n   <em>\n    see\n   </em>\n   Compl.).\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-94\">\n   The court found no case law interpreting a similar alternative dispute resolution clause.

The court, therefore, concludes that Mr. Bancroft was required to inform Minnesota Life that he wished to invoke his right to alternative dispute resolution under the ABPR. He did not do so. Therefore, Minnesota Life did not breach this provision of the ABPR by not engaging in either mediation or binding arbitration to resolve the dispute. Accordingly, the court grants Minnesota Life's motion for summary judgment on this issue and denies Mr. Bancroft's motion.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-95\">\n   In sum, the court grants Minnesota Life's motion for summary judgment that it did not breach the ABPR by failing to conduct an independent medical verification or examination of Mr. Bancroft.

Mr. Bancroft's bad faith claim focuses on the alleged inadequacy of Dr. Shapland's evaluation of the medical evidence and literature and the development of her opinion in June 2017, that Mr. Bancroft's life expectancy was greater than 24 months. (\n   <em>\n    See\n   </em>\n   <em>\n    id.\n   </em>\n   at 21-22; Kelley Decl. \u00b6 2, Ex. J at 7-9.) As described above, Mr. Kelley is not a doctor and has no medical expertise. (Kelley Decl. at 1.) Accordingly, the court excluded this portion of Mr. Kelley's opinion or testimony as inadmissible under Federal Rule of Evidence 702.\n   <em>\n    See supra\n   </em>\n   \u00a7 III.A.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-103\">\n   Moreover, Dr. Cowan testified that Mr. Bancroft's MIPI score was a reasonable basis for estimating his life expectancy and that a prognosis of either 29 or 37 months based on this score was reasonable. (\n   <em>\n    See\n   </em>\n   Cowan Dep. at 61:19-62:2; 62:24-63:8.) Indeed, as the court has already indicated, there is no admissible medical testimony in the record that Dr. Shapland's use of Mr. Bancroft's MIPI score to determine his life expectancy was unreasonable. (\n   <em>\n    See id.\n   </em>\n   ;\n   <em>\n    see also\n   </em>\n   Grinblatt Decl. \u00b6\u00b6 6, 10; Shapland Dep. at 71:14-17.) As such, the court concludes that no reasonable juror could conclude that Dr. Shapland's opinion represents a bad faith investigation of Mr. Bancroft's claim or that Minnesota Life's reliance upon her opinion was \"unreasonable, frivolous, or unfounded.\"\n   <em>\n    See\n   </em>\n   <em>\n    St. Paul Fire &amp; Marine Ins.

(\n   <em>\n    See\n   </em>\n   Plf. 2d MSJ at 22 (\"[I]t was bad faith for Minnesota Life to take away Bancroft's rights under the [alternative dispute resolution] [p]rovision.\"); Kelley Decl. \u00b6 2, Ex.

Indeed, Mr. Bancroft's doctor, Dr. Cowan, conceded in his deposition that basing a life expectancy prognosis on Mr. Bancroft's MIPI score, as Dr. Shapland did, was reasonable. (\n   <em>\n    See\n   </em>\n   Cowan Dep. at 61:19-62:2; 62:24-63:8.) The court has also determined that Minnesota Life did not breach the alternative dispute resolution clause of the ABPR because Mr. Bancroft never invoked this provision and thus Minnesota Life never had any obligation to perform under this clause.\n   <em>\n    See supra\n   </em>\n   \u00a7 III.C.2. Thus, the court denies Mr. Bancroft's motion and enters summary judgment in Minnesota Life's favor with respect to any CPA claim arising out Minnesota Life's determination to deny the payment of accelerated life insurance benefits to Mr. Bancroft in June 2017, or any alleged breach of the ABPR's alternative dispute resolution clause.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-109\">\n   Nevertheless, Mr. Bancroft also asserts that Minnesota Life violated various WAC regulations during its handling of his claim, and Mr. Bancroft argues that he is entitled to summary judgment on his CPA claim arising out of these WAC violations.

In addition, a single violation of WAC 284-23-600 through WAC 284-23-730, known as Washington's regulations of accelerated life insurance benefits, \"will be deemed to constitute an unfair claims settlement practice.\" WAC 284-23-610(1). Minnesota Life opposes Mr. Bancroft's motion and also seeks summary judgment in its favor regarding any CPA claim based on a violation of a WAC regulation. (Def. SMJ at 16-18.) The court considers each regulation in turn.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-110\">\n   1.\n   <em>\n    WAC 284-23-680\n   </em>\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-111\">\n   WAC 284-23-680 provides in pertinent part that \"[a]n insurer may not apply conditions on the payment of the accelerated benefits except those specified in the insured's policy or rider.\" WAC 284-23-680. Mr. Bancroft argues that Minnesota Life violated this provision by utilizing a \"90% certainty\" standard when it determined that Mr. Bancroft's life expectancy is 24 months or less because this standard is not stated in the ABPR. (\n   <em>\n    See\n   </em>\n   Plf. 2d MSJ at 17;\n   <em>\n    see also\n   </em>\n   4/19/18 Crowe Decl. \u00b6 3, Ex. 22 (attaching claim journal entries\n   from Minnesota Life for Mr. Bancroft's claim).) Instead, Mr. Bancroft asserts that she should have applied a \"more likely than not\" standard. (\n   <em>\n    See\n   </em>\n   Plf. 2d MSJ at 14.)\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-112\">\n   Even assuming that Minnesota Life's application of a \"90% certainty\" standard violated WAC 284-23-680, Mr. Bancroft's CPA claim based on this WAC provision nevertheless fails. As noted in the court's analysis of Mr. Bancroft's breach of contract claim, Dr. Shapland testified that her June 2017 opinion regarding Mr. Bancroft's life expectancy would have remained the same irrespective of whether she applied the \"90% certainty\" standard or a \"more likely than not\" standard.\n   <em>\n    See supra\n   </em>\n   \u00a7 III.C.1; (\n   <em>\n    see also\n   </em>\n   5/7/18 Shapland Decl. \u00b6 10.) There is no medical testimony to the contrary in the record. Thus, Mr. Bancroft cannot prove the final element of his CPA claim based on this WAC provision-that Minnesota Life's violation of WAC 284-23-680 caused him any damage.\n   <em>\n    See\n   </em>\n   <em>\n    Ledcor Indus.

A at ML 0037.) Even assuming that Minnesota Life applied a \"90% certainty\" standard in determining an insured's life expectancy, this standard was not in violation of WAC 284-23-680 because this condition was encompassed by the express language of the ABPR. Accordingly, the court denies Mr. Bancroft's motion for summary judgment and enters summary judgment on this claim in Minnesota Life's favor.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-114\">\n   2.\n   <em>\n    WAC 284-23-730\n   </em>\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-115\">\n   WAC 284-23-730 states in pertinent part:\n  </p>\n  <blockquote id=\"p-116\">\n   In the event the insured's health care provider and a health care provider appointed by the insurer disagree on whether a qualifying event has occurred, the opinion of the health care provider appointed by the insurer is not binding on the claimant.

Similar to the court's analysis of Mr. Bancroft's breach of contract claim concerning the ABPR's alternative dispute resolution clause, the court also concludes that, under this WAC provision, the difference of opinion between Dr. Cowan and Dr. Shapland concerning Mr. Bancroft's life expectancy required the parties to \"attempt to resolve the matter promptly and amicably,\" and-failing any amicable resolution-gave Mr. Bancroft \"the right to mediation or binding arbitration.\"\n   <em>\n    See\n    <extracted-citation index=\"75\" url=\"https://cite.case.law/citations/?q=206%20P.3d%201255\">\n     id.\n    </extracted-citation>\n   </em>\n   ;\n   <em>\n    see supra\n   </em>\n   \u00a7 III.C.2.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-118\">\n   Minnesota Life argues that its June 8, 2017, letter to Mr. Bancroft \"undisputedly offered to amicably engage with [Mr. Bancroft] regarding its June 8 claim decision.\" (Def.

(\n   <em>\n    Id.\n   </em>\n   ) As detailed above, Minnesota Life stressed in its June 8, 2017, letter that it was \"unable to determine, at this time,\" if Mr. Bancroft's life expectancy met the ABPR's requirements. (4/19/18 Crowe Decl. \u00b6 3, Ex. 24.) The letter also \"assured\" Mr. Bancroft that it was \"not a permanent denial.\" (\n   <em>\n    Id.\n   </em>\n   ) It encouraged Mr. Bancroft to submit new information for its review and stated that it would \"gladly reassess\" his claim for accelerated life insurance benefits.

Mr. Bancroft then filed suit on August 2, 2017. (\n   <em>\n    See\n   </em>\n   Compl.)\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-119\">\n   The WAC provision at issue requires that \"[t]he parties shall attempt to resolve the matter promptly and amicably.\" WAC 284-23-730. The provision is a mutual obligation placed on both the insurer and the insured. Based on the undisputed facts stated above, there is no evidence from which a jury could find that Minnesota Life violated its duty to attempt to resolve the matter promptly and amicably. Minnesota Life's June 8, 2017, letter emphasized that its determination was not \"permanent\" and encouraged further contact and discussion with Mr. Bancroft. (\n   <em>\n    See\n   </em>\n   4/19/18 Crowe Decl. \u00b6 3, Ex. 24.) If anything, the undisputed facts indicate that it was Mr. Bancroft who failed to comply with his obligations under this WAC provision and who rushed to suit. Further, as discussed above, although the WAC provides that in the case \"the disagreement is not [promptly and amicably] resolved, the claimant has the right to mediation or binding arbitration,\" WAC 284-23-730, Mr. Bancroft never invoked this right,\n   <em>\n    see supra\n   </em>\n   \u00a7 III.C.2. Accordingly, the court denies Mr. Bancroft's motion for summary judgment on this issue and grants summary judgment to Minnesota Life instead.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-120\">\n   3.\n   <em>\n    WAC 284-30-330(1)\n   </em>\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-121\">\n   WAC 284-30-330(1) provides that \"[m]isrepresenting pertinent facts or insurance policy provisions\" is \"defined as [an] unfair method[ ] of competition and [an] unfair or deceptive act[ ] or practice[ ] ... specifically applicable to the settlement of claims.\" WAC 284-30-330(1). Mr. Bancroft contends that Minnesota Life \" 'misrepresent[ed] pertinent facts' and misrepresent[ed] 'policy provisions' \" by stating in its June 8, 2017, letter to Mr. Bancroft that \"the medical information does not support a life expectancy of 24 months or less.\" (Plf. 2d MSJ at 18 (quoting WAC 284-30-330(1) ).) Without citation to the record, Mr. Bancroft argues that \"this is not true\" and that \"[t]here is medical information which fully supports such a life expectancy prognosis.\" (\n   <em>\n    Id.\n   </em>\n   )\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-122\">\n   Mr. Bancroft's lack of citation to the record is sufficient in itself to deny his motion for summary judgment.\n   <footnotemark>\n    17\n   </footnotemark>\n   Indeed, he cites to no medical expert testimony at all in support of his argument concerning Minnesota Life's statement. Nevertheless, Mr. Bancroft's argument appears to be based on Mr. Kelley's expert opinion that \"Minnesota Life misrepresented a critical fact as the basis for denying [Mr.] Bancroft's claim.\" (\n   <em>\n    See\n   </em>\n   Kelley Decl. \u00b6 2, Ex. J at 11.) As discussed above, Mr. Kelley's expert opinion is not admissible.\n   <em>\n    See supra\n   </em>\n   \u00a7 III.A. Thus, there is no admissible expert testimony to underpin Mr. Bancroft's argument concerning the medical information at issue here.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-123\">\n   To the contrary, all of the medical testimony in this case supports the reasonableness of Dr. Shapland's analysis. (Cowan Dep. at 13:3-12, 15:1-16:1, 61:19-63:8; Grinblatt Decl. \u00b6\u00b6 6, 10.) Accordingly, no reasonable juror could conclude that Minnesota Life violated WAC 284-30-330(1) based on the statement at issue. The court, therefore, denies Mr. Bancroft's motion and grants summary judgment to Minnesota Life on this issue.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-124\">\n   Mr. Bancroft also argues that Minnesota Life violated WAC 284-30-330(1) because its June 8, 2017, letter stated that \"we are unable to determine, at this time, if your life expectancy will be less than 24 months, which the policy requires.\" (\n   <em>\n    See\n   </em>\n   Plf. 2d MSJ at 18-19;\n   <em>\n    see also\n   </em>\n   10/25/17 Bancroft Decl. \u00b6 16, Ex. D.) Mr. Bancroft argues that this statement violates WAC 284-30-330(1) because the ABPR defines a \"terminal condition\" as \"a condition ... which directly results in a life expectancy of twenty-four months\n   <strong>\n    or less\n   </strong>\n   .\" (11/06/17 Marisseau Decl. \u00b6 4, Ex. A at ML 0037 (bolding added).) Minnesota Life admits that this incorrect statement of the policy language appeared in its June 8, 2017, letter. (Def. MSJ at 18.) However, Mr. Bancroft ignores the fact that the letter begins with a statement of the correct policy language and then restates the correct policy language two more times. (\n   <em>\n    See\n   </em>\n   10/25/17 Bancroft Decl. \u00b6 16, Ex. D.) No reasonable juror could conclude that Minnesota Life had breached WAC 284-30-330(1) by \"[m]isrepresenting ... insurance policy provisions\" on the basis of the single error Mr. Bancroft cites when that error is read against the letter as a whole, which states the correct policy language three times. Moreover, Mr. Bancroft provides no evidence that he was ever misled by this one incorrect statement of policy language. Thus, he fails to prove the causation element of his CPA claim.\n   <em>\n    See\n   </em>\n   <em>\n    Ledcor Indus. (USA), Inc.\n   </em>\n   ,\n   <extracted-citation index=\"77\" url=\"https://cite.case.law/citations/?q=206%20P.3d%201255\">\n    206 P.3d at 1262\n   </extracted-citation>\n   . Accordingly, the court denies Mr. Bancroft's motion for summary judgment on this issue and enters summary judgment in favor of Minnesota Life on the same issue.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-125\">\n   4.\n   <em>\n    WAC 284-30-330(4)\n   </em>\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-126\">\n   WAC 284-30-330(4) provides that \"[r]efusing to pay claims without conducting a reasonable investigation\" is \"defined as [an] unfair method[ ] of competition and [an] unfair or deceptive act[ ] or practice[ ] ... specifically applicable to the settlement of claims.\" WAC 284-30-330(4). Mr. Bancroft argues that Minnesota Life violated this WAC provision based on his criticism of Dr. Shapland's analysis of Dr. Cowan's opinion, Dr. Shapland's review of the medical literature, and her conclusion that his life expectancy was greater than 24 months in June 2017. (Plf. 2d MSJ at 19.) For all the same reasons that the court denied Mr. Bancroft's claim for bad faith claim investigation, the court also denies Mr. Bancroft's CPA claim under WAC 284-30-330(4) and enters summary judgment in Minnesota Life's favor.\n   <em>\n    See supra\n   </em>\n   \u00a7 III.E.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-127\">\n   5.\n   <em>\n    WAC 284-30-380(1)\n   </em>\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-128\">\n   Finally, Mr. Bancroft brings a CPA claim based on Minnesota Life's alleged violation of WAC 284-30-380(1). (Plf. 2d MSJ at 19-20.) WAC 284-30-380(1) provides that \"[t]he insurer must not deny a claim on the grounds of a specific policy provision, condition, or exclusion unless reference to the specific provision, condition, or exclusion is included in the denial.\" WAC 284-30-380(1). Mr. Bancroft argues that Minnesota Life violates this provision because it applied a \"90% certainty\" in assessing an insured's life expectancy but does not mention this standard in the ABPR or in its June 8, 2017, letter. (Plf. 2d MSJ at 19-20.) For the same reasons that the court denied Mr. Bancroft's motion for summary judgment on his CPA claim\n   based on WAC 284-23-680, the court does so here as well.\n   <em>\n    See supra\n   </em>\n   \u00a7 III.F.1, \u00a7 III.B.1. Mr. Bancroft cannot establish the causation element of his CPA claim because Dr. Shapland testified that her June 2017, opinion concerning Mr. Bancroft's life expectancy would have been the same whether she applied the \"90% certainty\" standard or the \"more likely than not\" standard Mr. Bancroft advocates. (\n   <em>\n    See\n   </em>\n   5/7/18 Shapland Decl. \u00b6 10.) Accordingly, the court concludes that he cannot prove the causation element of his CPA claim. For this reason, the court denies Mr. Bancroft's motion and enters summary judgment in Minnesota Life's favor instead.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-129\">\n   In sum, the court denies Mr. Bancroft's motion for summary judgment on all aspects of his CPA claim and enters summary judgment in favor of Minnesota Life on those same claims.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-130\">\n   <strong>\n    G. Covenant of Good Faith and Fair Dealing, Negligence, and Declaratory Relief\n   </strong>\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-131\">\n   Mr. Bancroft asks the court for summary judgment concerning liability on all of his claims. (Plf. 2d MSJ at 28.) Mr. Bancroft, however, provides no argument on his claims for breach of the covenant of good faith and fair dealing, negligence, and declaratory relief. (\n   <em>\n    See generally\n   </em>\n   <em>\n    id.\n   </em>\n   ;\n   <em>\n    see also\n   </em>\n   Compl. \u00b6\u00b6 49-54, 68-71.) Minnesota Life asserts that it is entitled to summary judgment on these claims for \"the same reasons [Mr. Bancroft's] IFCA, CPA[,] and bad faith claims fail.\" (Def. MSJ at 24.) Mr. Bancroft provides no response to this argument. (\n   <em>\n    See generally\n   </em>\n   Plf. Reply; Plf. Resp.) Having reviewed these additional claims and the court's grounds for granting Minnesota Life summary judgment on Mr. Bancroft's IFCA, CPA, and bad faith claims, the court agrees with Minnesota Life and grants summary judgment in its favor on Mr. Bancroft's remaining claims.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-132\">\n   <strong>\n    IV. CONCLUSION\n   </strong>\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-133\">\n   Based on the foregoing analysis, the court DENIES Mr. Bancroft's motion for partial summary judgment (Dkt. # 29) and GRANTS summary judgment on Minnesota Life's cross motion with respect to all of Mr. Bancroft's claims (Dkt. # 35).\n  </p>\n  <footnote label=\"1\">\n   <p id=\"p-136\">\n    Mr. Bancroft also provides a copy of the insurance policy and ABPR in his declaration.

This fact, however, does not support the notion that Minnesota Life breached the contract by denying Mr. Bancroft's claim due to the specific policy language at issue here.
