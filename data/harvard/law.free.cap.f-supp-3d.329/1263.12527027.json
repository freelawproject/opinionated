Hegarty, United States Magistrate Judge\n   Defendant FedEx Trade Networks T and B, Inc. (\"FedEx\") seeks summary judgment on all nine of Plaintiff Falgun Pathak's employment discrimination and retaliation claims. Because Mr. Pathak agreed to dismiss his seventh, eighth, and ninth causes of action, I will analyze whether summary judgment is proper as to his first six claims. I first find that Mr. Pathak timely exhausted his claims only as they relate to his termination and the failures to promote in May and June 2014. I then hold that Mr. Pathak demonstrates triable issues of fact regarding his Title VII and \u00a7 1981 discriminatory termination and failure to promote claims. However, Mr. Pathak produces insufficient evidence to support his prima facie disability discrimination claim. Regarding Mr. Pathak's retaliation claims, I hold disputed issues of material fact exist as to the Title VII and \u00a7 1981 claims, but not as to the Americans with Disabilities Act (\"ADA\") violation. Accordingly, I grant in part and deny in part FedEx's Motion for Summary Judgment.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-9\">\n   <strong>\n    <em>\n     BACKGROUND\n    </em>\n   </strong>\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-10\">\n   <strong>\n    I.

Pretext\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-95\">\n   A plaintiff demonstrates pretext by showing \"such weaknesses, implausibilities, inconsistencies, incoherencies, or contradictions in the employer's proffered legitimate reasons for its action that a reasonable factfinder could rationally find them unworthy of credence and hence infer that the employer did not act for the asserted non-discriminatory reason.\"\n   <em>\n    Lobato v.

Courts consider a variety of factors in determining whether a plaintiff has shown pretext, including: (1) whether the evidence indicates that the employer's proffered reason is false, which frequently involves analyzing the plaintiff's qualifications and the defendant's perception of the plaintiff's prior work performance; (2) the use of subjective criteria, especially when used to evaluate candidates that are not objectively equally qualified; (3) the employer's prior treatment of the plaintiff; (4) procedural irregularities; and (5) the employer's general policy with respect to minority employment, particularly statistics reflecting a general pattern of discrimination.\n   <em>\n    Colon-Sanchez\n   </em>\n   ,\n   <extracted-citation case-ids=\"576440,575522\" index=\"60\" url=\"https://cite.case.law/f2d/733/78/\">\n    733 F.2d at\n   </extracted-citation>\n   81 ;\n   <em>\n    Kendrick\n   </em>\n   ,\n   <extracted-citation case-ids=\"11214479\" index=\"61\" url=\"https://cite.case.law/f3d/220/1220/#p1225\">\n    220 F.3d at\n   </extracted-citation>\n   1230 ;\n   <em>\n    Santana v.

First, there is evidence indicating FedEx's reason for not promoting Mr. Pathak is false. Perhaps most telling, according to Mr. Pathak, Mr. Krupar told him he did not receive the supervisor promotion because of his Indian accent. Pathak dep. 140:16-:20. \"[C]omments regarding a plaintiff's accent may constitute circumstantial evidence of discrimination based on national origin.\"\n   <em>\n    Zokari v.

Additionally, Mr. Teschler and Ms. Zobel-the employees FedEx hired instead of Mr. Pathak-arguably had less experience. Mr. Teschler had six and a\n   half years of relevant experience, and Ms. Zobel had been working in FedEx's brokerage department for one or two years before receiving the promotion. Teschler dep., 22:8-:11, ECF No. 99-13; Krupar dep., 154:17-155:6, ECF No. 99-6. Mr. Pathak had approximately twenty-one years of industry experience.

Such a disparity in relevant experience can contribute to a finding of pretext.\n   <em>\n    see\n   </em>\n   <em>\n    Griffis v.

If a jury were to believe all of this testimony, it could reasonably conclude that FedEx did not deny Mr. Pathak a promotion because of inferior qualifications.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-97\">\n   Second, Mr. Pathak produces evidence that Mr. Krupar treated him in a racially hostile manner. In January 2013, Mr. Krupar asked Mr. Pathak why Asian people get cold sores, and they commented that Americans do not have cold sores. Def.'s Statement of Facts \u00b6 67; Pl.'s Resp. to Def.'s Statement of Facts \u00b6 67. Two months before Mr. Krupar declined to promote Mr. Pathak, Mr. Krupar stated in an email, \"In Asia everyone is late all the time but that does not cut it here.\" ECF No. 89-13, at 3. Although isolated racial comments are insufficient to establish pretext,\n   <em>\n    Antonio v.

Prima Facie Case\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-101\">\n   \"[A] prima facie case of discrimination must consist of evidence that (1) the victim belongs to a protected class; (2) the victim suffered an adverse employment action; and (3) the challenged action took place under circumstances giving rise to an inference of discrimination.\"\n   <em>\n    EEOC v.

FedEx does not dispute that Mr. Pathak satisfies the first two elements. Mot. for Summ. J. 21. Therefore, I must analyze only whether Mr. Pathak establishes an inference of discrimination.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-102\">\n   Mr. Pathak carries his burden. Before FedEx terminated Mr. Pathak, Mr. Krupar made racially hostile remarks on at least three occasions. First, in a meeting on June 23, 2014, Mr. Krupar told Mr. Pathak he had an anger management problem, and he portrayed Mr. Pathak's face as that of a monkey. Def.'s Statement of Facts \u00b6 22; Pl.'s Resp. to Def.'s Statement of Facts \u00b6 22; Pathak dep. 136:7-138:24. Although FedEx disputes that Mr. Krupar intended to portray a monkey, I must view this evidence in a light most favorable to Mr. Pathak at this stage. Second, Mr. Krupar commented that Mr. Pathak does not have American experience, and his Indian accent is too strong. Pathak dep. 139:21-141:25. Finally, Mr. Krupar stated that everyone in Asia is late all the time, but that is not acceptable in America. ECF No. 89-13, at 3. Because Mr. Krupar was one of the managers ultimately responsible for Mr. Pathak's suspension and\n   termination, I find these comments sufficient to establish a prima facie case of national origin and race discrimination.\n   <em>\n    see\n   </em>\n   <em>\n    Greene v.

Colo. 2007) (finding that insubordinate behavior was a legitimate and non-discriminatory reason for an adverse employment action).

Pretext\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-106\">\n   In support of his pretext argument, Mr. Pathak produces evidence that FedEx's asserted nondiscriminatory reason is false, that FedEx treated him differently from other employees, and that his supervisor acted in a racially hostile manner. I find this sufficient to establish pretext for purposes of summary judgment.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-107\">\n   First, viewing the evidence in a light most favorable to Mr. Pathak, a jury could reasonably determine that he was not as insubordinate as FedEx claims. Although Mr. Pathak objected to closed-door meetings for mental health reasons and regularly complained that his managers were retaliating against him, he continued to take part in the meetings as requested. ECF No. 89-8, at 14; Hawkins dep., 28:24-29:5, ECF No. 89-6; Pathak dep. 289:11-290:5; Def.'s Statement of Facts \u00b6\u00b6 21, 36, 44, 53; Pl.'s Resp. to Def.'s Statement of Facts \u00b6\u00b6 2, 36, 44, 53. Additionally, Mr. Pathak left the final closed-door meeting after receiving permission from HR and only because he felt as if he was going to collapse. Pathak dep. 289:11-290:5, 295:18-:24. To be sure, Mr. Pathak potentially raised his voice during a meeting with Mr. Krupar, and he verbally challenged his supervisor after receiving an email with feedback. However, two other participants in the meeting stated that although Mr. Pathak raised his voice, he did not yell, Krupar dep. 184:19-:24,\n   <footnotemark>\n    3\n   </footnotemark>\n   and Mr. Pathak testified under oath that he responded to his supervisor in an calm manner without yelling. Pathak dep. 286:12-:15. A jury could, and very well may, reasonably accept FedEx's evidence that Mr. Pathak yelled across the office and was consistently unwilling to accept constructive criticism. However, a jury could also believe Mr. Pathak's testimony and conclude that FedEx did not truly believe Mr. Pathak's behavior warranted termination.\n   <footnotemark>\n    4\n   </footnotemark>\n   I cannot resolve this factual dispute at summary judgment.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-108\">\n   Second, Mr. Pathak presents evidence that his managers treated him differently than his non-minority co-workers.\n   <em>\n    see\n   </em>\n   <em>\n    E.E.O.C. v.

Moreover, viewing the evidence in a light most favorable to Mr. Pathak, he did not have an extensive history of insubordinate behavior. Instead, as explained above, he potentially raised his voice to Mr. Krupar during one meeting, he verbally responded to Mr. Teschler in a calm manner, and he regularly asked not to be given in-person feedback due to his depression and anxiety.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-110\">\n   Lastly, Mr. Pathak demonstrates pretext through evidence that Mr. Krupar treated him in a racially hostile manner. As explained above, Mr. Krupar told Mr. Pathak that he did not receive a promotion, because he did not have \"American experience\" and his accent was too \"Indian.\" Pathak dep. 140:16-:20. Furthermore,\n   viewing the evidence in a light most favorable to Mr. Pathak, Mr. Krupar portrayed Mr. Pathak as resembling a monkey. Pathak dep. 136:7-138:24. Because this took place during a meeting in which Mr. Pathak was accused of insubordinate conduct, it is at least arguably related to the decisional process.\n   <em>\n    Cone v.

Finally, although not directly made to Mr. Pathak, Mr. Krupar stated about him, \"In Asia everyone is late all the time but that does not cut it here.\" ECF No. 89-13, at 3. All of these comments and conduct, taken together, at least raise an inference that Mr. Krupar and the other FedEx employees responsible for Mr. Pathak's termination did not fire him because of his insubordinate conduct.\n   <em>\n    see\n   </em>\n   <em>\n    Tomsic v.

Unlike for his race and national origin claims, Mr. Pathak did not testify that anyone at FedEx made comments regarding his disability. To the contrary, while Mr. Pathak was on medical leave, Mr. Krupar wished Mr. Pathak well, stated he was glad Mr. Pathak was feeling better, and said he looks forward to Mr. Pathak's recovery and return to the office. ECF No. 89-8, at 106-07, 104. Additionally, FedEx permitted Mr. Pathak to take two medical leaves of absence and allowed him to work part-time for several weeks to attend doctor appointments.

Prima Facie Case\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-125\">\n   The elements necessary to establish a prima facie retaliation claim under Title VII and \u00a7 1981 are: (1) the plaintiff engaged in protected opposition to discrimination, (2) the plaintiff suffered a material adverse employment action, and (3) a causal connection exists between the protected opposition and the adverse employment action.\n   <em>\n    Zokari v.

Therefore, the only remaining issue is whether a causal connection exists between Mr. Pathak's protected complaints and his termination.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-126\">\n   The proximity in time between Mr. Pathak's protected conduct and his termination establishes a causal connection sufficient to overcome summary judgment. Mr. Pathak complained of retaliation during the November 17, 2014 meeting, which was mere hours before his suspension and a month before his termination.\n   <footnotemark>\n    8\n   </footnotemark>\n   Pathak\n   dep. 296:2-:5, ECF No. 99-7; ECF No. 89-9, at 50-51. Additionally, Mr. Pathak had complained of retaliation the day before in an email to Mr. Teschler, Mr. Krupar, and Mr. Holmes. Def.'s Statement of Facts \u00b6 44; Pl.'s Resp. to Def.'s Statement of Facts \u00b6 44; ECF No. 89-9.

Therefore, the proximity between Mr. Pathak's retaliation complaints and his termination establish a prima facie retaliation case.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-127\">\n   FedEx argues proximity should be measured on Mr. Pathak's first complaint, which was over nine months prior to his termination. Reply in Supp. of Mot. for Summ. J. 7, ECF No. 103. However, the Tenth Circuit has held that proximity is measured based on the employee's \"last instance of protected activity.\"\n   <em>\n    E.E.O.C. v.

Reply in Supp. of Mot. for Summ. J. 8-9. However, viewing the evidence in a light most favorable to Mr. Pathak, he objected that the December 17 meeting was retaliatory, stated that he was not feeling well, and went back to his cubicle after receiving permission from HR. Def.'s Statement of Facts \u00b6 53; Pl.'s Resp. to Def.'s Statement of Facts \u00b6 53; Pathak dep. 295:18-:24. This conduct is not sufficiently serious to undermine the causal link established by proximity.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-129\">\n   In sum, because FedEx suspended Mr. Pathak within hours of his last retaliation complaint and terminated him approximately one month later, Mr. Pathak demonstrates a causal connection between his protected activity and his termination.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-130\">\n   2. Non-discriminatory Reason\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-131\">\n   As explained above, FedEx's proffered reason for terminating Mr. Pathak-that he was insubordinate and disruptive toward his managers-is a legitimate non-discriminatory reason. Accordingly, Mr. Pathak must offer evidence suggesting that this reason is pretext for a retaliatory motive.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-132\">\n   3. Pretext\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-133\">\n   As I stated above, a plaintiff generally shows pretext through (1) evidence indicating that the employer's proffered reason for the discrimination is false; (2) evidence that the employer used subjective criteria in the employment decision; (3) evidence of the employer's prior treatment of the plaintiff; (4) procedural irregularities; and (5) statistics reflecting a general pattern of discrimination.\n   <em>\n    Colon-Sanchez v.

Although a very close call, the evidence before me demonstrates that FedEx's reason for terminating Mr. Pathak may have been pretext for retaliatory animus.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-134\">\n   First, although not sufficient by itself to establish pretext, the temporal proximity between Mr. Pathak's protected conduct and his retaliation is highly probative of pretext.\n   <em>\n    Annett v.

Before Mr. Pathak made his first discrimination or retaliation complaint, Mr. Holmes stated that he has \"the aptitude and attitude\" to perform the job well. ECF No. 99-3. Additionally, FedEx promoted Mr. Pathak and gave him a raise. ECF No. 89-7, at 130. Shortly after this promotion, Mr. Pathak complained that he did not receive an additional raise \"because of the color of [his] skin.\" ECF No. 99-8. Although he applied for many, Mr. Pathak did not receive another promotion while working at FedEx. Furthermore, it was only after Mr. Pathak's complaints that his supervisors treated him in a hostile manner, such as by coming to his cubicle and shutting down his computer. Def.'s Statement of Facts \u00b6 18. \"Evidence of different treatment after protected activity is probative of pretext.\"\n   <em>\n    Enstrom v.

Although a jury could certainly find that FedEx treated Mr. Pathak differently because of his performance and insubordinate behavior, whether Mr. Pathak was truly recalcitrant is a disputed issue of fact that I cannot resolve at this stage.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-136\">\n   Third, Mr. Pathak's evidence that his supervisor made comments exhibiting racial animus is probative of pretext.\n   <em>\n    see\n   </em>\n   <em>\n    O'Neal v.

Accordingly, this constitutes further evidence in support of pretext.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-138\">\n   In sum, the evidence before me sufficiently establishes that FedEx's asserted reason for terminating Mr. Pathak was pretext for retaliation. Any one of the factors supporting a finding of pretext would likely be insufficient by itself.

First, he engaged in protected activity by regularly requesting an accommodation for his depression-that FedEx permit him to receive feedback by email.\n   <em>\n    Jones v.

Third, Mr. Pathak requested the accommodation just one day prior to his suspension and one month before his termination. ECF No. 89-9, at 44-49. This is sufficient to establish a causal connection.\n   <em>\n    see\n   </em>\n   <em>\n    Foster v.

Non-discriminatory Reason\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-145\">\n   FedEx asserts it terminated Mr. Pathak because of his insubordinate conduct, which as I have stated, constitutes a legitimate non-discriminatory reason for his termination.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-146\">\n   3. Pretext\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-147\">\n   I find Mr. Pathak fails to submit sufficient evidence of pretext. Unlike with regard to his race and national origin complaints, his supervisors did not start treating him differently directly after he was diagnosed with major depressive affective disorder or after he began requesting the accommodation. In fact, Mr. Pathak requested the accommodation partially due to the fact that his supervisors were allegedly treating him poorly. Similarly, Mr. Pathak does not present evidence that his supervisors made comments demonstrating disability bias. Although they denied his requests for feedback via email, they did not ridicule his request or his disability. Therefore, Mr. Pathak relies purely on the temporal proximity between his requests for accommodation and his termination. This is insufficient to establish pretext.\n   <em>\n    Annett v. Univ. of Kan.\n   </em>\n   ,\n   <extracted-citation case-ids=\"9233651\" index=\"113\" url=\"https://cite.case.law/f3d/371/1233/#p1240\">\n    371 F.3d 1233\n   </extracted-citation>\n   , 1240 (10th Cir. 2004) (\"[C]lose temporal proximity is a factor in showing pretext, yet is not alone sufficient to defeat summary judgment.\").\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-148\">\n   <strong>\n    <em>\n     CONCLUSION\n    </em>\n   </strong>\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-149\">\n   In sum, Mr. Pathak exhausted his administrative remedies with regard to his claims for discriminatory and retaliatory termination and discriminatory failure to promote. However, he did not include in\n   his EEOC charge any allegations regarding FedEx's failure to accommodate his disability. Additionally, all of FedEx's actions taking place prior to April 23, 2014 cannot form the basis for Mr. Pathak's claims.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-150\">\n   Regarding the merits of his claims, Mr. Pathak demonstrates triable issues of fact underlying his Title VII and \u00a7 1981 race and national origin discrimination and retaliation claims. Accordingly, I deny summary judgment on Mr. Pathak's first, second, third, and fourth claims. However, Mr. Pathak fails to produce evidence demonstrating that FedEx terminated him because of his disability or retaliated against him for being disabled or requesting an accommodation. As such, I grant summary judgment in favor of FedEx on Mr. Pathak's fifth and six causes of action. FedEx's Motion for Summary Judgment [\n   <em>\n    filed February 28, 2018; ECF No. 89\n   </em>\n   ] is\n   <strong>\n    granted in part and denied in part\n   </strong>\n   .\n  </p>\n  <footnote label=\"1\">\n   <p id=\"p-153\">\n    These facts are undisputed unless otherwise cited.\n   </p>\n  </footnote>\n  <footnote label=\"2\">\n   <p id=\"p-154\">\n    FedEx argues that Mr. Pathak fails to establish a hostile work environment claim.

Resp. to Mot. for Summ. J. 21-22, 34-35. However, I do not rely on this evidence for this purpose. It is undisputed that FedEx's progressive discipline \"policy\" was discretionary, ECF No. 89-9, and the Tenth Circuit has specifically held that failure to follow a discretionary policy is not evidence of pretext.\n    <em>\n     Timmerman v.

Therefore, I rely on this evidence only in so much as it demonstrates FedEx treated Mr. Pathak differently than similarly situated employees.\n   </p>\n  </footnote>\n  <footnote label=\"6\">\n   <p id=\"p-158\">\n    Mr. Pathak's fifth claim does not assert FedEx failed to promote him because of his disability.
