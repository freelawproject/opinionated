Code Ann. tit. 8, \u00a7 157\n       </extracted-citation>\n       . For Plaintiff's stock options, the terms are contained in three interrelated instruments: OMH's 2007 Stock Incentive Plan, the Stock Option Award Agreement, and a Notice of Stock Option Award. (JSUF \u00b6 2.) The Court will examine each item in turn.\n      </p>\n      <p id=\"p-18\">\n       To promote the success of OMH, the 2007 Stock Incentive Plan (\"Stock Plan\") establishes a framework for the company to award stock options to its employees, directors, and consultants. (Stock Plan \u00a7 1, Pugh Decl. Ex. 1, ECF No. 47-3 at 4.) A person who receives an award of stock options under the Stock Plan is referred to as a \"Grantee.\" (\n       <em>\n        Id.\n       </em>\n       \u00a7 2(x).) An \"Option\" is defined as \"an option to purchase Shares pursuant to an Award Agreement granted under the Plan.\" (\n       <em>\n        Id.\n       </em>\n       \u00a7 2(cc).) Plaintiff's \"Award Agreement\" is the second document discussed below, and the Stock Plan defines this item as \"the written agreement evidencing the grant of an award executed by the Company and the Grantee, including any amendments thereto.\" (\n       <em>\n        Id.\n       </em>\n       \u00a7 2(f).)\n      </p>\n      <p id=\"p-19\">\n       Beyond establishing a structure for OMH to award options, the Stock Plan sets forth various ground rules for these awards. For example, the Plan speaks to what happens upon the occurrence of a \"Corporate Transaction.\" A Corporate Transaction includes \"a merger or consolidation in which the Company is not the surviving entity\" and an \"acquisition ... of securities possessing more than fifty (50%) of the total combined voting power of the Company's outstanding securities....\" (Stock Plan \u00a7 2(q).) The Plan provides that a Corporate Transaction affects awarded stock options as follows:\n      </p>\n      <p id=\"p-20\">\n       (a)\n       <em>\n        Termination of Award to Extent Not Assumed\n       </em>\n       .\n      </p>\n      <p id=\"p-21\">\n       (i)\n       <em>\n        Corporate Transaction\n       </em>\n       . Effective upon the consummation of a Corporate Transaction, all outstanding Awards under the Plan shall terminate. However, all such Awards shall not terminate to the extent they are assumed in connection with the Corporate Transaction.\n      </p>\n      <p id=\"p-22\">\n       (\n       <em>\n        Id.\n       </em>\n       \u00a7 11(a).) Relatedly, the Stock Plan grants its administrator the authority \"to provide for the full or partial automatic vesting and exercisability of one or more outstanding unvested awards under the Plan.\" (\n       <em>\n        Id.\n       </em>\n       \u00a7 11(b).) The plan administrator may do so \"in advance of any actual or anticipated Corporate Transaction\" or \"at the time of the grant of an Award.\" (\n       <em>\n        Id.\n       </em>\n       )\n      </p>\n      <p id=\"p-23\">\n       The Stock Plan also discusses the suspension or termination of the company's stock option program. (Stock Plan \u00a7 14.) It imbues OMH's board of directors with the power to \"amend, suspend, or terminate the Plan\" at \"any time.\" (\n       <em>\n        Id.\n       </em>\n       \u00a7 14(a).) That being said, \"any termination of the Plan ... shall not affect Awards already granted, and such awards shall remain in full force and effect as if the Plan had not been ... terminated[.]\" (\n       <em>\n        Id.\n       </em>\n       \u00a7 14(b).)\n      </p>\n      <p id=\"p-24\">\n       Finally, the Plan provides Grantees like Plaintiff with a limited information right: \"The Company shall provide to each Grantee, during the period for which such Grantee has one or more Awards outstanding, copies of financial statements at least annually.\" (Stock Plan \u00a7 19.)\n      </p>\n      <p id=\"p-26\">\n       Pursuant to the Stock Plan's framework, Plaintiff entered into a Stock Option Award Agreement (\"Option Agreement\") with OMH. (Option Agreement \u00a7 1, Pugh Decl. Ex. 2, ECF No. 47-3 at 22.) This agreement, which is subject to the terms of the Stock Plan, grants Plaintiff the stock options described in an accompanying Notice of Stock Option Award. (\n       <em>\n        Id.\n       </em>\n       ) The Option Agreement provides that these options \"shall be exercisable during [their]\n      </p>\n      <p id=\"p-27\">\n       term in accordance with the Vesting Schedule set out in the Notice and with the applicable provisions of the Plan and this Option Agreement.\" (\n       <em>\n        Id.\n       </em>\n       \u00a7 2(a).) Further, this agreement states Plaintiff may exercise his options \"only by delivery of an Exercise Notice (attached as Exhibit A) which shall state the election to exercise the Option [and] the whole number of Shares in respect of which the Option is being exercised[.]\" (\n       <em>\n        Id.\n       </em>\n       \u00a7 2(b).)\n      </p>\n      <p id=\"p-28\">\n       <strong>\n        3. Notice of Stock Option Award\n       </strong>\n      </p>\n      <p id=\"p-29\">\n       The Notice of Stock Option Award details the specifics of Plaintiff's stock options. (Notice of Stock Option Award, Pugh Decl. Ex. 3, ECF No. 47-3 at 38.) It provides him the option to purchase 268 shares of OMH's common stock at an exercise price of $2,493.34 per share, for a total cost of up to $668,215.12. (\n       <em>\n        Id.\n       </em>\n       ) The Notice also provides a vesting schedule for Plaintiff's options: his right to purchase the first third of the 268 shares vests on May 23, 2012; the second third vests on May 23, 2013; and the remainder vests on May 23, 2014. (\n       <em>\n        Id.\n       </em>\n       )\n      </p>\n      <p id=\"p-30\">\n       Pursuant to the Notice, Plaintiff's options expire on May 23, 2021. (Notice of Stock Option Award.) If Plaintiff separates from the company, however, the Notice states he instead has a three-month period to choose whether to exercise those options that have already vested. (\n       <em>\n        Id.\n       </em>\n       ) Finally, the Notice states that if there is a \"Change of Control of the Company whereby a majority ownership is bought by a single investor, all the stock options will vest immediately.\"\n       <footnotemark>\n        1\n       </footnotemark>\n       (\n       <em>\n        Id.\n       </em>\n       )\n      </p>\n      <p id=\"p-31\">\n       In sum, the Stock Plan creates the company's stock option program that Plaintiff participated in, and it provides for the termination of any outstanding awards upon a Corporate Transaction. The Option Agreement grants Plaintiff options under this Plan and binds him to the Plan's terms. Last, the Notice of Stock Option Award provides the specifics of Plaintiff's award, including the number of options, the amount he needs to pay per share to exercise the options, and when his options become exercisable and expire.\n      </p>\n      <p id=\"p-33\">\n       \"Plaintiff's employment as C.O.O. with Defendant's company in India ended in about May 2012.\" (JSUF \u00b6 6.) Thus, under the terms of his stock option award, Plaintiff had only three months from his date of separation to exercise his vested options.\n       <footnotemark>\n        2\n       </footnotemark>\n       (Notice of Stock Option Award.) However, when he separated from the company, Plaintiff and OMH entered into a Separation Agreement dated May 28, 2012. (\n       <em>\n        Id.\n       </em>\n       \u00b6 7.) The Separation Agreement extended the date for Plaintiff to exercise his options as follows: \"All of your stock options granted to you on May 23, 2011, via Award number OMH-028, must be exercised by October 15, 2012. This clause supersedes the 'Post-Termination Exercise Period' defined in [the Notice].\" (Separation Agreement, Pugh Decl. Ex. 4, ECF No. 47-3 at 43.) Further, the Separation Agreement notes:\n      </p>\n      <p id=\"p-34\">\n       If a change of control occurs prior to you exercising your options, it is anticipated\n      that the buyer will only purchase a portion of the outstanding options from the management team (50% is our expectation but will be up to the buyer), which you are a part of. Whatever portion the buyer allows the management team to exercise is the same percentage that will be used to determine the number of options you will be able to sell. None of your remaining options will be extended past the change of control.\n      </p>\n      <p id=\"p-35\">\n       (\n       <em>\n        Id.\n       </em>\n       )\n       <footnotemark>\n        3\n       </footnotemark>\n       The Court will refer to this provision as the \"Management Team Options Provision.\" The Separation Agreement also provides for Plaintiff to continue to work for OMH as a consultant until November 30, 2012. (\n       <em>\n        Id.\n       </em>\n       )\n      </p>\n      <p id=\"p-36\">\n       Plaintiff asked to extend the deadline for him to exercise his options because he knew there was a potential OMH would be sold. (JSUF \u00b6 16.) OMH's President Anurag Mehta testified that from 2011 onward, OMH was \"constantly in ... sale mode,\" and that \"it was not any secret.\" (\n       <em>\n        Id.\n       </em>\n       \u00b6 14.) Following Plaintiff's departure from OMH, then-board member Dennis Drislane testified that he would give Plaintiff \"the general sense that [OMH was] still in the market looking for a buyer,\" but not \"any confidential information as it relates to deals [OMH was] working on.\" (\n       <em>\n        Id.\n       </em>\n       \u00b6 12.) Specifically, on September 27, 2012, Plaintiff e-mailed Drislane asking about the status of a pending deal. (Fundingsland Decl. \u00b6 10, Ex. 1.) Drislane responded:\n      </p>\n      <p id=\"p-38\">\n       (\n       <em>\n        Id.\n       </em>\n       )\n      </p>\n      <p class=\"attorneys\" id=\"p-40\">\n       The Board is willing to extend the execution period for 1/3 of the original number of your options (90), since you worked for us for 1 year of the contemplated 3-year employment period. The exercise period for these 90 options will be extended from October 15, 2012, to March 31, 2013. We hope to have a transaction done in the first quarter, so that would allow you to benefit from a transaction that is completed over the next six months. Even if a transaction is not completed during this six month period, it still would allow you to exercise your options next year with the resulting tax implications potentially offset by a transaction that occurs any time in 2013.\n      </p>\n      <p id=\"p-41\">\n       (\n       <em>\n        Id.\n       </em>\n       )\n      </p>\n      <p id=\"p-42\">\n       Accordingly, on October 9, 2012, Plaintiff and OMH amended the Separation Agreement. (JSUF \u00b6 8.) Plaintiff's number of stock options was reduced from 268 to 90, and the exercise date for the options was extended until March 31, 2013. (\n       <em>\n        Id.\n       </em>\n       )\n      </p>\n      <p id=\"p-43\">\n       Finally, in an amendment to the Separation Agreement dated March 29, 2013, the parties further extended the exercise date for Plaintiff's stock options to December 31, 2013. (JSUF \u00b6 9.) By this time, Plaintiff was no longer working as a consultant for OMH. (\n       <em>\n        Id.\n       </em>\n       \u00b6\u00b6 6, 27.) On April 2, 2013,\n      Drislane told Plaintiff via e-mail that \"[t]he Board has approved extending your options through the end of the year\" and \"[h]opefully we will have a transaction done by then!\" (\n       <em>\n        Id.\n       </em>\n       \u00b6 13.)\n      </p>\n      <p id=\"p-45\">\n       Meanwhile, on March 27, 2013, OMH and an entity that ultimately purchased the controlling interest in the company (\"August 2013 Purchaser\") entered into a Mutual Non-Disclosure Agreement (\"NDA\") regarding potential business relationship discussions. (JSUF \u00b6 17.) The NDA restricted the use of confidential information to employees, attorneys, agents, and other individuals needing to know such information to facilitate the potential business arrangement. (NDA \u00b6 3, Pugh Decl. Ex. 8, ECF No. 47-3 at 53.)\n      </p>\n      <p id=\"p-47\">\n       On August 30, 2013, OMH's Board of Directors terminated the Stock Plan. (JSUF \u00b6 23.) On the same day, a Corporate Transaction occurred when the August 2013 Purchaser and OMH entered into a Series B Convertible Preferred Stock Purchase Agreement (\"SPA\"). (\n       <em>\n        Id.\n       </em>\n       \u00b6 24.) \"Under Section 5.5 of the SPA, all outstanding stock options were automatically terminated pursuant to the terms of the Stock Option Plan.\" (\n       <em>\n        Id.\n       </em>\n       \u00b6 25.)\n      </p>\n      <p id=\"p-48\">\n       While some of OMH's employees involved in due diligence for the Corporate Transaction were aware of the pending August 2013 Transaction, CEO Natarajan testified that none of OMH's active employees exercised their stock options before the sale of the company. (JSUF \u00b6 26.) Nor did OMH publish the \"change in the stock option plan ... to the option holders.\" (\n       <em>\n        Id.\n       </em>\n       \u00b6 44.) Further, CEO Natarajan testified that employees who had stock options at the time of the sale did not receive compensation related to the stock options. (\n       <em>\n        Id.\n       </em>\n       \u00b6 47.)\n      </p>\n      <p id=\"p-50\">\n       Although none of OMH's active employees exercised their stock options before the sale, thirteen employees received \"Closing and Change in Control Bonuses.\" (JSUF \u00b6\u00b6 48-51.) CEO Natarajan stated these bonuses were \"purely stay bonus[es]\" based on tenure and seniority in the company. (\n       <em>\n        Id.\n       </em>\n       \u00b6 48.) Plaintiff, however, has produced a \"spreadsheet indicating that 13 of the 14 of [OMH's] employees granted Closing and/or Change in Control Bonuses received bonuses in an amount of 41% [of] the value of their outstanding options ... and that 1 out of the 14 received a bonus that was 48% of the value of her outstanding options.\" (\n       <em>\n        Id.\n       </em>\n       \u00b6\u00b6 49-50.)\n      </p>\n      <p id=\"p-51\">\n       \"On October 24, 2013, [Plaintiff] reached out to [President] Mehta to inquire about the status of a transaction. During that conversation, Mehta denied any sale or change in control.\" (Fundingsland Decl. \u00b6 13.) \"Plaintiff testified that while he had the financial capability and there was nothing preventing him from exercising the stock options, he nevertheless chose not to exercise his stock options.\" (JSUF \u00b6 29.) Plaintiff later learned of the Corporate\n      Transaction from another person, but when he again spoke with President Mehta, \"Mehta told [him] that as a result of this transaction, [his] options had been terminated in August 2013.\" (Fundingsland Decl. \u00b6 15.)\n      </p>\n      <p id=\"p-53\">\n       In his First Amended Complaint, Plaintiff brought claims against OMH for (1) breach of contract, (2) breach of the implied covenant of good faith and fair dealing, and (3) fraudulent misrepresentation and concealment. (First Am. Compl. \u00b6\u00b6 18-40, ECF No. 17.) The Court granted OMH's motion to dismiss Plaintiff's concealment claim, but denied the company's request to dismiss Plaintiff's contract claims.\n       <footnotemark>\n        4\n       </footnotemark>\n       (ECF No. 24.)

(First Am. Compl. \u00b6\u00b6 22-24.) OMH moves for summary judgment on this claim, arguing it did not breach this express provision. (Mot. Summ. J. 3:10-28.) In response, Plaintiff seeks to survive summary judgment based on not only this contractual obligation, but also a series of additional provisions that he did not identify in his pleading. (Opp'n 10:7-18:9;\n       <em>\n        see also\n       </em>\n       Reply 1:8-4:2.) The Court will first address the provision raised in Plaintiff's First Amended Complaint; it will then turn to whether considering Plaintiff's additional theories based on other contractual obligations is appropriate.\n      </p>\n      <p id=\"p-64\">\n       <strong>\n        1. Management Team Options Provision\n       </strong>\n      </p>\n      <p id=\"p-65\">\n       Plaintiff argues summary judgment is inappropriate because a jury could conclude OMH breached the Management Team Options provision \"by denying him a lump sum predicated on the value of his options.\" (Opp'n 16:25-18:9.) To recall, this provision states, \"if a change in control occurs prior to [Plaintiff] exercising [his] options, ... [w]hatever portion the buyer allows the management team to exercise is the same percentage that will be used to\n      determine the number of options [he] will be able to sell.\" (Separation Agreement 2.)\n      </p>\n      <p id=\"p-66\">\n       Plaintiff fails to demonstrate there is a genuine issue for trial on this claim. The plain language of the Management Team Options Provision promises that Plaintiff \"will be able to sell\" the same \"percentage ... of options\" as the buyer \"allows the management team to exercise.\" It is undisputed, however, that due to the Corporate Transaction, \"all outstanding stock options were automatically terminated pursuant to the terms of the Stock Option Plan.\" (JSUF \u00b6 25.) They were terminated because the August 2013 Purchaser did not assume them in the transaction. (\n       <em>\n        See\n       </em>\n       Stock Plan \u00a7 11(a)(i) (providing that unless outstanding awards are assumed in the Corporate Transaction, \"all outstanding Awards under the Plan shall terminate).) None of OMH's \"active employees exercised their stock options before the sale of\" the company. (\n       <em>\n        Id.\n       </em>\n       \u00b6 26.) Consequently, as a matter of law, Plaintiff cannot show the management team ... exercise[d]\" a \"percentage\" of their options, which would have triggered the provision he claims the company breached. In other words, he cannot demonstrate OMH breached the Management Team Options Provision.\n       <em>\n        See, e.g.\n       </em>\n       ,\n       <em>\n        SV Inv.

And, given that Plaintiff fails \"to make a sufficient showing on an essential element\" of his breach of contract claim, summary judgment on this cause of action is warranted.\n       <em>\n        See\n       </em>\n       <em>\n        Celotex\n       </em>\n       , 477 U.S. at 323,\n       <extracted-citation case-ids=\"6207800\" index=\"35\" url=\"https://cite.case.law/us/477/317/#p322\">\n        106 S.Ct. 2548\n       </extracted-citation>\n       .\n      </p>\n      <p id=\"p-67\">\n       Plaintiff nevertheless tries to survive summary judgment by focusing on the Closing and Change in Control Bonuses awarded to thirteen employees. (Opp'n 17:3-18:9.) He argues the evidence-viewed in the light most favorable to him-demonstrates these bonuses were \"predicated solely on the value of outstanding options,\" creating a triable issue of material fact on his breach of contract claim. (\n       <em>\n        Id.\n       </em>\n       18:5-7.)\n      </p>\n      <p id=\"p-68\">\n       The Court is unconvinced. Even if the Closing and Change in Control Bonuses were awarded based on the value of outstanding options, this interpretation does not displace the fact that Plaintiff's unexercised options were terminated under the plain language of the Stock Plan. (JSUF \u00b6 25.) Nor does this interpretation mean the company's management team members \"exercise[d]\" a percentage of their options in the sale-triggering the Management Team Options Provision. (\n       <em>\n        See\n       </em>\n       Separation Agreement 2.) They did not. (JSUF \u00b6 26.) Simply put, Plaintiff still does not demonstrate the plain language of the Management Team Options Provision was breached.\n      </p>\n      <p id=\"p-69\">\n       In sum, because Plaintiff has not produced evidence demonstrating OMH breached the Management Team Options Provision, OMH is entitled to judgment as a matter of law on Plaintiff's claim for breach of this obligation.\n      </p>\n      <p id=\"p-70\">\n       <strong>\n        2.

Rather, OMH filed this summary judgment motion targeting the contract provision Plaintiff identified in his First Amended Complaint in response to the company's motion to dismiss.

Plaintiff's First Amended Complaint was filed seventeen months before his Opposition to OMH's motion for summary judgment. The delay is also unexplainable. For instance, one of the new provisions Plaintiff argues OMH breached is the requirement that the company provide him with annual financial statements. But whether OMH provided Plaintiff with financial statements during the years prior to this lawsuit was within Plaintiff's knowledge at the time he commenced this action.

As the Court of Chancery has explained, anti-destruction provisions are critical for option holders:\n      </p>\n      <p class=\"attorneys\" id=\"p-99\">\n       Before the advent of anti-destruction clauses, options were rendered worthless if the company engaged in a transaction that destroyed the underlying security, even if that underlying security was thereby converted into the right to receive something else of value.

But, unlike the security agreements in the cases mentioned above, the parties' agreements do nothing to prevent the destruction of OMH's outstanding options.

(ECF No. 69.) The Court disagrees. The Option Agreement provides only that \"[t]he Notice, the Plan, and this Option Agreement ... may not be modified adversely to the Grantee's interest except by means of a writing signed by the Company and the Grantee.\" (Option Agreement \u00a7 17.) That is, the Option Agreement provides that the terms of the option instruments may not be changed to Plaintiff's detriment without his consent. This provision does not require that he be generally notified of impending actions that are adverse to his economic interests. Further, OMH did not adversely modify any of the agreements' terms when it terminated Plaintiff's unexercised options-the company was already expressly authorized to take this action under Section 11(a)(i) of the Stock Plan. Hence, the Court rejects Plaintiff's argument that the Option Agreement's modification provision supports an implied obligation to inform Plaintiff of an impending transaction.\n       <em>\n        See\n       </em>\n       <em>\n        Dunlap\n       </em>\n       ,\n       <extracted-citation case-ids=\"8942379\" index=\"98\" url=\"https://cite.case.law/a2d/878/434/#p444\">\n        878 A.2d at 441\n       </extracted-citation>\n       (\"[O]ne generally cannot base a claim for breach of the implied covenant on conduct authorized by the terms of the agreement.\").\n      </p>\n      <p id=\"p-104\">\n       In addition, although some of OMH's treatment of Plaintiff may appear \"unfair,\" that is not the Court's inquiry.
