Code ch. 23-2-2.5, and the Indiana Deceptive Franchise Practices Act (\"Practices Act\"). Ind. Code ch. 23-2-2.7. Management Recruiters has moved to dismiss Gre-Ter's complaint for failure to state a claim. Dkt. 9. Management Recruiters also seeks oral argument on its motion. Dkt. 12.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-10\">\n   For the reasons explained below, the motion to dismiss is granted in part and denied in part. Because the briefs adequately present the issues for decision, we deny the motion for oral argument.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-11\">\n   <strong>\n    <em>\n     Factual and Procedural Background\n    </em>\n   </strong>\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-12\">\n   The complaint alleges the following, which, read together with the materials attached to the complaint,\n   <footnotemark>\n    2\n   </footnotemark>\n   we take as true for the purposes of the instant motion. Management Recruiters is a franchisor of recruiting and contract-staffing businesses. In 1998 and again in 2005, Gre-Ter entered into franchise agreements with Management Recruiters (\"the 1998 agreement\" and \"the 2005 agreement\"; together, \"the franchise agreements\"). For at least part of the terms of the franchise agreements, Gre-Ter's interest in the franchise has been shared with several individual franchisees, at least some of whom were or are Gre-Ter shareholders. This lawsuit, however, has been brought by Gre-Ter only.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-13\">\n   The 1998 agreement granted Gre-Ter the exclusive right to operate a franchise office in the territory of Boone County, Indiana. No restrictions were placed on Gre-Ter's right to do business outside the territory from its Boone County office, nor on the right of other franchisees to do business within Boone County from offices outside the territory. The 2005 agreement granted Gre-Ter the same rights for the territory of Hamilton County, Indiana, excluding the city of Noblesville. But at the time this case was filed, Management Recruiters's website informed prospective franchisees that its franchises have \"no territory [ ]or border restrictions[,]\" and that their prospective \"success is not limited by restrictive franchise territories.\" Compl. \u00b6 50. In this way or in others, Management Recruiters \"ha[s] allowed other franchisees to locate their offices and operate within\" Gre-Ter's exclusive territory.\n   <em>\n    Id.\n   </em>\n   \u00b6 51.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-14\">\n   The franchise agreements further provide that Gre-Ter would pay to Management Recruiters a \"national advertising fee,\" Dkt. 1 Ex. A, at 22 (1998 agreement), or an \"advertising, marketing, and public relations fee,\"\n   <em>\n    id.\n   </em>\n   at 159 (2005 agreement), equal to one-half percent of Gre-Ter's gross receipts from the franchise. Other than their designation as advertising fees, the franchise agreements specified nothing about what Management Recruiters was to do with the funds so collected. The 2005 agreement provided that the fees were \"for [Management Recruiters's] benefit[.]\"\n   <em>\n    Id.\n   </em>\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-15\">\n   The franchise agreements were occasionally amended. In 2002, four new shareholders purchased stock in Gre-Ter. In 2005, Gre-Ter's majority shareholders transferred control of the corporation to its minority shareholders. Both transactions were memorialized in the second and fifth amendments to the franchise agreements, respectively.\n   <em>\n    See\n   </em>\n   <em>\n    id.\n   </em>\n   at 36 (second amendment),\n   <footnotemark>\n    3\n   </footnotemark>\n   174 (fifth amendment).\n   <footnotemark>\n    4\n   </footnotemark>\n   In 2015, the thirteenth amendment to the franchise agreements memorialized the transfer of a portion of the individual franchisees' interest in the franchise to a new individual.\n   <em>\n    See\n   </em>\n   <em>\n    id.\n   </em>\n   at 299.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-16\">\n   Franchisors are required by state and federal law to make certain disclosures to prospective franchisees.\n   <extracted-citation index=\"0\" url=\"https://cite.case.law/citations/?q=16%20C.F.R.%20%C2%A7%20436.2\">\n    16 C.F.R. \u00a7 436.2\n   </extracted-citation>\n   (a) ;\n   <extracted-citation index=\"1\" url=\"https://cite.case.law/citations/?q=Ind.%20Code%20%C2%A7%2023-2-2.5\">\n    Ind.

The complaint does not allege that Management Recruiters failed to make the required disclosures to Gre-Ter before it became a franchisee of Management Recruiters in 1998 or 2005. The complaint does allege that, in connection with the changes to Gre-Ter's ownership structure memorialized in the second and fifth amendments, Management Recruiters supplied Gre-Ter with copies of its 2002 and 2004 disclosure statements (\"the 2002 disclosure statement\" and \"the 2004 disclosure statement\"; together, \"the disclosure statements\"). The complaint alleges further that Management Recruiters failed to supply Gre-Ter with its newest disclosure statement upon the 2015 transfer memorialized in the thirteenth amendment.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-17\">\n   Among other requirements, federal regulation required the disclosure statements to state \"the franchisor's principal assistance and related obligations\" with respect to the \"franchisor's assistance, advertising, computer systems, and training.\"\n   <extracted-citation index=\"2\" url=\"https://cite.case.law/citations/?q=16%20C.F.R.%20%C2%A7%20436.5\">\n    16 C.F.R. \u00a7 436.5\n   </extracted-citation>\n   (k) (initial capitals omitted).

The disclosure statements represented further that Management Recruiters would supply franchisees with an annual accounting of payments into and from the Fund. While every other section of the disclosure statements describing the franchisor's obligations cited the section number of Management Recruiters's standard franchise agreement that imposed the particular obligation described, none of the disclosures relating to advertising referred to any part of the standard franchise agreement.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-20\">\n   In April 2017, Gre-Ter received a \"Rep Update article\" from Management Recruiters's \"U.S. Representative Council.\" Compl. \u00b6 55.

Opp. 9. The sufficiency of the latter two allegations depends on Gre-Ter's assertion that Management Recruiters's disclosure statements are enforceable against it as part of the parties' contracts. We address that assertion below, for Count I is saved by a single nonconclusory allegation of breach of the franchise agreements themselves.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-36\">\n   <em>\n    A.

If true, this practice would violate the franchise agreements. We observe that the balance of Gre-Ter's complaint and its briefing strongly suggest that this allegation refers only to Management Recruiters's current practice of offering franchise agreements without territorial restrictions, not to any specific franchisee to whom Management Recruiters has granted a franchise to operate an office within Gre-Ter's territory-such that Management Recruiters has, at most, invited rather than committed a breach of contract. Nevertheless, we must take paragraph 51 of the complaint as pleaded and draw every nonspeculative inference in Gre-Ter's favor.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-38\">\n   In a footnote in its opening brief, Management Recruiters argues that, \"to the extent that Gre-Ter's claim arises from the allegation that [Management Recruiters] has allowed other franchisees to locate their offices within Gre-Ter's territory (\n   <em>\n    see\n   </em>\n   Compl. \u00b6 51), there is no breach because the franchise agreements were amended to allow for such stores within Gre-Ter's territory[.]\" Br. Supp. 11 n. 6 (citing twelfth amendment to franchise agreements, Dkt. 1 Ex. A, at 296-97). That does not quite tell the whole story, however. By its terms, the twelfth amendment to the franchise agreements returned a portion of Gre-Ter's territory to Management Recruiters for the use of one prospective franchisee \"Ellis\"; permitted Management Recruiters to grant an easement to Ellis to operate an office at a certain address within Gre-Ter's territory, on the condition\n   <em>\n    inter alia\n   </em>\n   that Ellis be prohibited from operating offices both at the easement address and within the transferred territory; and finally memorialized the right of one \"Campeas\" to operate an office within Gre-Ter's territory.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-39\">\n   The upshot is that Management Recruiters is wrong to suggest that the twelfth amendment extended blanket permission to other franchisees to operate within Gre-Ter's territory. Rather, the amendment appears to have redefined that territory and subjected its exclusivity only to the circumscribed rights of Ellis and Campeas. None of this defeats or is even inconsistent with Gre-Ter's allegation that Management Recruiters has \"allowed other franchisees to locate their offices ... within [its] exclusive territory and borders.\" Compl. \u00b6 51. In its reply brief, Management Recruiters insists it has continued to honor the terms of its agreements with Gre-Ter, including the twelfth amendment. Br. Reply 4.

The nonconclusory factual allegations set forth under Count IV do not relate to disparate treatment of any description.\n   <em>\n    See\n   </em>\n   Compl. \u00b6\u00b6 88-89. In its brief, Gre-Ter argues that Management Recruiters has discriminated against it by failing to honor its territorial exclusivity. But this is nothing more than the breach of contract alleged in Count I and discussed above. There are no factual allegations relating to similarly situated comparators, to how those comparators have been arbitrarily treated more favorably than Gre-Ter, or to how such disparate treatment has been\n   <em>\n    unfair.\n   </em>\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-73\">\n   As for unreasonable failure or refusal to comply with the franchise agreement under Subsection 5, again Gre-Ter adverts to its breach-of-contract allegations. Though here as elsewhere we proceed with little precedent to guide us, it is clear at least that Subsection 5 is not merely duplicative of the common-law action for breach of contract, for Indiana courts presume that the Indiana General Assembly \"did not enact a useless provision.\"\n   <em>\n    Hinshaw v.

The claim under Subsection 5 is therefore presumptively narrower than the common-law action: the franchisor's breach of the franchise agreement must be due to an \"\n   <em>\n    unreasonable\n   </em>\n   fail[ure] or refus[al]....\"\n   <extracted-citation index=\"90\" url=\"https://cite.case.law/citations/?q=Ind.%20Code%20%C2%A7%2023-2-2.7\">\n    Ind.

And no allegations in the complaint give rise to a plausible inference\n   that Management Recruiters refused not to grant a new franchisee an office in Gre-Ter's exclusive territory after being asked not to do so by Gre-Ter, or that Management Recruiters's alleged breach was otherwise \"unreasonable,\" beyond simply constituting a breach.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-74\">\n   Finally, as for the use of deceptive acts in connection with the franchise or the franchisor's business under Subsection 8, the complaint alleges that Management Recruiters \"presented for signing a franchise agreement in which the terms and conditions differed materially from those presented in the template contained in the disclosure document, and [Management Recruiters] did not inform prospective franchisees and [Gre-Ter] of the differences before execution of franchise agreements [\n   <em>\n    sic\n   </em>\n   ].\" Compl. \u00b6 89.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-75\">\n   As to Management Recruiters's conduct toward other franchisees or prospective franchisees, Gre-Ter obviously cannot maintain an action for another's injuries.\n   <em>\n    See\n   </em>\n   <extracted-citation index=\"91\" url=\"https://cite.case.law/citations/?q=Ind.%20Code%20%C2%A7%2023-2-2.7\">\n    Ind.
