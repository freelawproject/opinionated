Demurrers to the declarations were overruled, and judgments rendered for the plaintiffs. Thereupon the railroad company sued out these writs of error.</summary><summary data-order=\"9\" data-type=\"summary\" id=\"b190-5\" pgmap=\"190\">The assignment of errors presents the questions, first, whether the instrument sued upon is a several one, upon which each one of the obligees may severally sue; and, second, if that be so, whether it was not necessary that the extent of'the interests of the other obligees should have been alleged in the declarations, so that it could have been determined what were the relative and respective rights of the plaintiffs.</summary><attorneys data-order=\"10\" data-type=\"attorneys\" id=\"b190-6\" pgmap=\"190\">Hessrs Hat and Cullom, for the plaintiffs in error.</attorneys><p data-order=\"11\" data-type=\"legal\" id=\"b190-7\" pgmap=\"190\">In an action upon a bond, which upon its face expressly denotes the parties to it, the action must be between the parties to it, regardless of the conditions expressed in the defeasance, or the parties to be benefited by the condition of the bond, l Chitty\u2019s PI. 3, 4.</p><p data-order=\"12\" data-type=\"legal\" id=\"b190-8\" pgmap=\"190\">In this case the suit is debt, upon the penal obligation for the payment of $3,000 by the obligors to the obligees \u201cjointly \u201d \u2014the words, \u201c according to their relative and respective several interests,\u201d do not, under the well settled rules of law, make the penalty sued for a several penalty to each, nor authorize \u00e1 suit therefor by one of the obligees without joining the others.</p><p data-order=\"13\" data-type=\"legal\" id=\"b190-10\" pgmap=\"190(90) 191(22)\">It cannot be intended that this is a several bond to each of the obligees; that the sureties thereon would be liable to eight times the amount of the bond in several suits by the several obligees suing separately. The very language relied upon in the bond as authorizing a suit in the name of each obligee, contradicts this. The penalty of $3,000 was to all the obligees, but to be proportioned (as the sense of it must be) according to their respective several interests. Where the obligation is to pay one sum to eight named persons, there can be no such thing as a several legal interest in that sum.</p><p data-order=\"14\" data-type=\"legal\" id=\"b191-5\" pgmap=\"191\">Two or more persons may bind themselves jointly and severally, according to the language of the bond; but a person cannot be bound to several persons severally, and therefore, if an obligation be made to two persons in the sum of $200, $100 to each of them, the part as to the payment is void, and the action upon the bond must be joint. Hurlston on Bonds, 96; Bacon\u2019s Abr., Ob. D. But a man may covenant with two severally, for that sounds only in damages. Bacon\u2019s Abr., Ob. D.</p><p data-order=\"15\" data-type=\"legal\" id=\"b191-6\" pgmap=\"191\">The rule in actions of covenant that a covenant will be construed to be joint or several, according to the interest of the parties appearing upon the face of the deed, if the words are capable of that construction, have no application to a case like this. In that class of cases, the covenant is directly for the performance of the act for the non-performance of which damages are claimed. But the direct form of the obligation here, is for the payment of a penalty, which may be avoided by the performance of the conditions in the bond, and thus indirectly through the penalty the performance of the conditions are secured. But there is no direct covenant for the performance of the conditions. By this obligation, the obligors bind themselves by a penalty of $3,000 in s\u00f3lido to the obligees, and this penalty cannot, at law, be apportioned or severed so as to give to the several obligees a right of suit for the portion appearing to be due him by the condition of the bond. The suit must be for the whole penalty by all the obligees. All the obligees must join as plaintiffs in bringing the action, if alive, and the presumption is, they are living, unless the contrary is alleged. Hurlston on Bonds, 96; Bacon\u2019s Abr., Ob.

It would so far as the penal obligation goes, be treated as a joint covenant with all the obligees; they are jointly interested in the penalty of the bond, although severally interested in the conditions of the bond.

These lands were held by several persons, but each holding by separate and distinct title, as shown by declarations in the record; therefore the consideration \u201c moved from many but from each severally \u201d\u2014and therefore action should be several.</p><p data-order=\"22\" data-type=\"legal\" id=\"b192-10\" pgmap=\"192\">Mere connection in an obligation, or even in an interest, will not make parties joint in law. It is the identity of that interest which gives one the right to act tor all, that constitutes them joint in law. 1 Parsons, 21, 2, 34.</p><p data-order=\"23\" data-type=\"legal\" id=\"b192-11\" pgmap=\"192\">As to right of several action see note C to Parsons on Contracts, vol. 1, p. 20.

The actions are debt, and are brought upon an instrument by which the defendants acknowledge themselves bound unto nine persons according to their relative and respective several interests, in the penal sum of three thousand dollars, which is conditional that the railroad company shall, on the assessment of damages to be made to secure the right of way, pay to the obligees, relatively and respectively, the damages which may be assessed as aforesaid. The declarations allege the assessment of the damages of the plaintiff in each suit, and the non-payment of the same by the railway company; but it is not alleged that the damages of the other obligees have been assessed, nor is there any allegation in regard to the extent of their respective interests. The obligees were severally the owners of different tracts of land over which the railway company were proceeding to condemn a right of way, and the obligation was given to secure to them such damages as might be assessed to them severally in the proceedings for condemnation. It is evident that the interest of the obligees was several. A contract will be construed as joint or several, according to the interests of the parties appearing upon the face of the obligation, if the words are capable of such a construction. 1 Black (U. S.) 309. The instrument sued upon expressly states that the interests of the obligees are several, and we think its words are capable of the construction of an obligation to the obligees severally. The defendants in terms oblige themselves to the obligees, according to their relative and respective interests, to the extent of three thousand dollars. But while we hold the instrument to be a several one, upon which each one of the obligees may severally sue, yet no one of them- has a right to recover upon it more than his relative and respective share of the penalty. The declarations should have alleged the extent of the interests of the other obligees, and then it could have been determined what was the relative and respective right of the plaintiff. The \u25a0obligees in their several suits upon the instrument are not to recover more than the three thousand dollars. If the damages assessed in favor of them all amounted to inore than the penalty of the instrument, each obligee can only recover his relative and respective share of that sum. The declarations do not show whether the plaintiffs were entitled to recover upon the instrument the whole amounts of their damages or a less sum. For this reason the demurrers should have been sustained. The judgments of the court below will be reversed, and the causes remanded.</p> <p id=\"b194-5\" pgmap=\"194\">Judgments reversed.</p> </opinion> </casebody> ",
