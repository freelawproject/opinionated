The partnership affairs of two firms were submitted to arbitration. The arbitrators awarded that one of the parties, who was a member of both firms, account and pay to the two firms a stipulated sum, that the parties be entitled to the proceeds of all uncollected and outstanding assets of those firms in equal amounts, and that the costs of arbitration be equally divided between the parties. It was held, the award settled the rights and liabilities of the parties with sufficient certainty. The presumption being that, as partners, the parties were equally entitled to the proceeds of the partnership, and in equal parts to the amount found to be due from the partner who was indebted to the firm, the award was relieved from all uncertainty.</headnotes><headnotes data-order=\"5\" data-type=\"headnotes\" id=\"b299-13\" pgmap=\"299\">5.

Where the directions of the arbitrators can with tolerable ease be reduced to a certainty, as by reference to any written document, or the inspection of any particular thing, house or land, the award is not impeachable. Nor is it impeachable because reference is made to matters of account not liquidated nor footed nor balanced and the precise result is unknown, and the award directs that a party shall pay a certain proportion of the balance of such account. Caldwell on Arbitration, 250, 251, 268; 13 Verm. 53; 2 Hill, 75; 25 Ill. 522.</p><p data-order=\"18\" data-type=\"legal\" id=\"b301-11\" pgmap=\"301(21) 302(40)\">Every reasonable intendment shall be made in support of an award.

The award is to be construed liberally, and the main consideration for the court is whether the matters submitted have been substantially considered and passed upon and decided by the arbitrators. 22 Pick. 144; 20 Verm. 132; 3 Scam. 248, 249; 14 Ill. 62.</p><p data-order=\"20\" data-type=\"legal\" id=\"b302-6\" pgmap=\"302\">The court will presume that Henriekson and appellee Harry Reinback were equally interested in the amount awarded to be paid by Harry Reinback to the firms of Henrickson &amp; Reinback, and Reinback &amp; Van Winkle. 25 Ill. 522.</p><attorneys data-order=\"21\" data-type=\"attorneys\" id=\"b302-7\" pgmap=\"302\">Messrs. D. A. &amp; T. W. Smith,</attorneys><p data-order=\"22\" data-type=\"legal\" id=\"ANi\" pgmap=\"302\">for the defendants in error, contended that the declaration was defective in not setting out with sufficient legal certainty the interest of the plaintiff- in the award. This ought not to be left to loose intendment or implication of law, as to equal interests of partners. The award is too uncertain in these respects.</p> <opinion data-order=\"23\" data-type=\"opinion\" id=\"x999-1\" type=\"majority\"> <author id=\"b302-8\" pgmap=\"302\">Mr. Justice Breese</author> <p id=\"A0\" pgmap=\"302\">delivered the opinion of the Court:</p> <p id=\"b302-9\" pgmap=\"302\">It is, we believe, a principle generally admitted, that an award, being the judgment of a tribunal of the parties\u2019 own choosing, should be liberally construed to sustain it, if it does not lack two essential properties, namely, certainty and finality. This certainty is judged of only according to a common intent, consistent with fair and reasonable presumption. Purdy v. Delavan, 1 Caines (N. Y.), 304.</p> <p id=\"b302-10\" pgmap=\"302\">It is also held that courts will not suffer an award to be disturbed which is so far certain as from the nature of the subject of it could be reasonably expected; and when the directions of the arbitrators, though not decidedly certain upon the face of the award, can, with tolerable ease, be reduced to a certainty, as by reference to any written document, or the inspection of any particular thing, house or land, an award will not be on such ground impeachable. Caldwell on-Arbitration, 251.</p> <p id=\"b303-4\" pgmap=\"303\">As to finality, the award must make a final disposition of the matters submitted.</p> <p id=\"b303-5\" pgmap=\"303\">The declaration in this case avers that the parties to the arbitration were partners in trade, and differences having arisen between them, an arbitration was agreed upon, and the bond in suit executed, which was lost. By the loss of the bond, the terms of the submission are not before us, but from the allegations in the declaration we can readily understand that the partnership rights and liabilities were alone submitted to the arbitrators. Does the award settle those rights and liabilities with sufficient certainty? The arbitrators, after hearing the testimony, and upon due consideration thereof, award that Reinback account to and pay to the firms of Henrickson &amp; Rein-back, and Reinback &amp; Van Winkle, the sum of twelve hundred and ninety-six XW dollars; that the parties be entitled to the proceeds of all uncollected and outstanding assets of those firms in equal amounts, and that the cost of arbitration be equally divided between the parties.</p> <p id=\"b303-6\" pgmap=\"303\">\u25a0 We think this award fulfills the conditions of certainty to a common intent, and finality. It was a difference among partners which was submitted, and the presumption is, each was entitled to equal portions of the proceeds \u2014 that they were equally interested. Farr v. Johnson, 25 Ill. 522. In that ease the award made reference to an account, and it was held the account might be examined to sustain the award.</p> <p id=\"b303-7\" pgmap=\"303\">Now, the presumption being that, as partners, they were equally entitled to the proceeds of the partnership, and in equal parts to the amount found to be due from Reinback, the award is relieved from all uncertainty.</p> <p id=\"b303-8\" pgmap=\"303\">It is also final, because the award settles forever their respective rights and claims, and can be pleaded to any action brought for a settlement and account. That is the purport and clear intendment of the finding of the arbitrators.</p> <p id=\"b303-9\" pgmap=\"303(43) 304(54)\">As to the pleadings, the several breaches assigned are analogous to several counts in a declaration, and if one count be good a general demurrer will not be sustained. The breaches for the nonpayment of the twelve hundred and ninety-six fVV dollars, for non-payment of the costs, and of one half of the moneys collected by Reinback, are well assigned. They negative the requirements of the award. The first breach is, in substance, that defendant did not pay the $1,296.90 to the firms, nor did he pay it to the plaintiff, or any part of it.</p> <p id=\"b304-4\" pgmap=\"304\">We are of opinion judgment on the demurrer should have been for the plaintiff. The Circuit Court having adjudged differently, the judgment must be reversed, and the cause remanded for further proceedings not inconsistent with this opinion.</p> <p id=\"b304-5\" pgmap=\"304\">Judgment reversed.</p> </opinion> </casebody> ",
