Tinder to John A, Brittenham, to secure his ten promissory notes, payable to Brittenham on the first days of April, in the years from 1857 to 1866, inclusive. The complainant was the assignee of a portion of the indebtedness secured by the mortgage, being a j udgment recovered by Brittenham for a balance due on the note maturing on 1st of April, 1859, and the note falling due 1st April, 1863. Previously, on the 14th of April, 1856, Brittenham transferred to James McReynolds the notes falling due on the 1st days of April, in the years 1857 and 1858. McReynolds recovered a judgment against Tinder at the April Term, 1857, of the court below, on the note maturing 1st of April, 1857, sued out an execution thereon, which was levied upon the mortgaged premises, except eleven acres thereof. The premises levied upon were sold on the 13th day of October, 1857, by the sheriff, and McReynolds became the purchaser for the amount of his execution and costs. The lands sold not being redeemed, the sheriff conveyed the same to McReynolds, on the 29th of August, 1859. On the same day Brittenham transferred to McReynolds the notes falling due on the first days of April, in the years 1860, 1861, 1862,1864, 1865 and 1866.</summary><summary data-order=\"11\" data-type=\"summary\" id=\"b482-9\" pgmap=\"482\">On the 21st of September, 1860, Tinder, the mortgagor, still being in possession of the mortgaged premises, conveyed the sam\u00e9 to Daniel Kelly.</summary><summary data-order=\"12\" data-type=\"summary\" id=\"b483-4\" pgmap=\"483\">This was the relative position of the parties in interest when the bill to foreclose was filed by Funk.

The complainant, Funk, answered the cross-bill, denying the rights of the administrators of McReynolds to have a foreclosure, or to have payment of any of the notes held by them prior to the payment of his own. Allen McReynolds answered the original bill, showing his interest as heir of James McReynolds. The answers were all without oath, and replications were filed.

This is the general rule, that the purchase of the equity of redemption by the mortgagee, especially in consideration of the mortgage debt, merges the charge in the estate and extinguishes the mortgage lien, and it cannot afterwards be set up against subsequent mortgages. Toulmin v. Steere, 3 Meriv. 209 to 224; Parry v. Write et al., 1 Sim. and Stu. 369; Brown v. Stead, 5 Sim. 535 (found in 7th Eng. Oh. 524); Burnet v. Denison, 5 Johns. 35 to 40; James v.

He made no efforts to collect any of these notes during his lifetime; he never did, nor said anything to indicate any intention to rely on or keep up his mortgage. Funk seeing the debt satisfied of record, and that McReynolds had purchased near $10,000 worth of land for less than $1,100 (Tinder gave $10,000 for 651 acres, 640 of which are embraced in McReynolds\u2019 deed), supposes that he (McReynolds) has abandoned his mortgage, and therefore becomes the bona fide purchaser for the value of the two outstanding notes (in effect two junior mortgages), and must be in as good position as was the bank judgment in the case of Campbell v. Carter. McReynolds had the right to foreclose on the first note, and thus save his mortgage lien; his election to sell and purchase the equity of redemption under a judgment at law, must be taken, in absence of any other proof, as evidence of his intention to abandon the mortgage.</p><p data-order=\"48\" data-type=\"legal\" id=\"b490-5\" pgmap=\"490\">In Mocatta v. Murgatroyd, 1 P. Wms. 395, and it is believed in every well considered case since, when a party, capable of making an election, who has acquired the equity of redemption, has been allowed to set up his mortgage against subsequent mortgages, it has been on condition that he waive his claim to the equity of redemption.</p><p data-order=\"49\" data-type=\"legal\" id=\"b490-6\" pgmap=\"490\">In this case McReynolds never offered to waive his right, and his administrators cannot do it.</p><p data-order=\"50\" data-type=\"legal\" id=\"b490-7\" pgmap=\"490\">At the death of James McReynolds the absolute title to 640 acres of the mortgaged premises vested in his heirs, subject to the payment of Funk\u2019s notes. This decree requires the heirs to pay to the administrators the amount due on the note due April 1, 1857, by the payment and satisfaction of which they obtained title through their ancestor, James McReynolds, and in default forecloses them. The administrators are not charged with anything on account of the note due April 1st, 1857, and have no right to demand payment of it. Tinder paid it to James McReynolds, and we insist, all other notes held by him, by allowing him to take a deed for $10,000 worth of land, for no other consideration than his (Tinder\u2019s) indebtedness on these notes. By the sheriff\u2019s deed McReynolds took all of Tinder\u2019s interest in the 640 acres, including dower, the debt being for purchase-money, and Tinder had a right to have the notes held by McReynolds satisfied. They have been treated as satisfied by McReynolds during his life, no payment having been demanded, though one of them had been due more than four years prior to his death.</p><p data-order=\"51\" data-type=\"legal\" id=\"b490-8\" pgmap=\"490(67) 491(89)\">This decree in effect subjects the lands belonging to the heirs of James McReynolds for sale cn the petition of the administrators, without anything to show that such sale is necessary to pay the debts of the deceased. It subjects to a cash sale some $10,000 worth of the heirs\u2019 lands, without any reason, except it be to increase the commissions of the administrators. Such a sale for cash, on short notice, subjects Funk to imminent risk of losing his security, and divests the heirs, who have only constructive notice, and many of whom may be infants, of title to a large and valuable tract of land, without any assurance that they will get an equivalent therefor, and without any good reason for so doing. There was no evidence to show that Tinder retained possession, as stated in argument by defendants\u2019 counsel; the fact being that Kelley is in possession as tenant to McReynolds.</p><p data-order=\"52\" data-type=\"legal\" id=\"b491-5\" pgmap=\"491\">The decree is manifestly to the prejudice of Funk and the heirs of McReynolds, and in no way subserves the purposes of justice.

The heirs of James McReynolds being unknown, we have not thought it best to join them as plaintiffs in error, but suppose that this court has power to protect their interest as well as Funk\u2019s, by a modification or reversal of the decree.</p><attorneys data-order=\"54\" data-type=\"attorneys\" id=\"b491-7\" pgmap=\"491\">Mr. Charles Watts, for the defendants in error.</attorneys><p data-order=\"55\" data-type=\"legal\" id=\"b491-8\" pgmap=\"491\">When Brittenham assigned to James McReynolds the notes falling due April 1st, 1857 and 1858, McReynolds took the benefit of the mortgage, and was entitled to priority of payment out of the mortgage security. The sale of a part of the mortgaged premises, under the judgment obtained on the first note, was. not a satisfaction of the mortgage indebtedness held by James McReynolds. This is the case only upon strict foreclosure, where the land is of equal value to the debt. Vansant v.

The reasonable presumption therefore is, that he would choose to keep the mortgage on foot. Where no-intention is expressed, or the party is-incapable of expressing' any, I apprehend the court considers what is most advantageous to him.\u201d In that case Moffitt paid \u00a35,000 on the subsequent mortgage which was relied on by the real representatives as showing his intention to abandon the charge on the mortgaged premises of his own mortgage. But the master of the rolls says, that (had Moffitt intended that his mortgage no longer subsisted) \u201che might have entered some memorandum on the record, signifying that the other\u201d (his mortgage) \u201cno longer subsisted.\u201d That was regarded by the master as a circumstance which \u201c weighs something in favor of the personal representatives.\u201d</p><p data-order=\"64\" data-type=\"legal\" id=\"b493-4\" pgmap=\"493\">That was a case between personal and real representatives of John Moffitt, deceased,- decided since the case of Macatta v.

Tinder made his ten promissory notes for $1,000 each, payable to John A. Brittenham or order, on the 1st day of April in the years from 1857 to 1866, inclusive, with interest annually in advance, and \u25a0 also executed a mortgage deed of several tracts of land to secure payment of the same. The first year\u2019s interest upon the notes was paid in-advance. On the 14th of April, 1856, Brittenham sold and transferred to James McReynolds the notes falling due on the 1st day of April in the years 1857 and 1858. McReynolds sued Tinder, declaring upon the note due 1st April, 1857, and at the April Term, 1857, of the Circuit Court for Piatt county, recovered judgment thereon for $1,087tV\u00f3 damages and costs. Afterwards, McReynolds sued out an execution upon the judgment, and caused the same to be levied upon the premises mortgaged, excepting eleven acres thereof. The premises levied upon were sold by the sheriff to McReynolds, on the 13th of October, 1857, for the amount of the execution and costs. None of the lands sold were redeemed; and on the 29th August, 1859, the sheriff conveyed the same to McReynolds. On the 29th August, 1859, Brittenham sold and transferred to McReynolds the notes falling due on the 1st day of April in the years 1860, 1861, 1862, 1864, 1865 and 1866, which are now held by his administrators. In September, 1859, Brittenham recovered a judgment against Tinder for $504T2g3g, the balance then due on the note falling due 1st April, 1859, and on the 24th January, 1861, assigned this judgment and the note falling due 1st April, 1863, to the plaintiff in error. The sale of an equity of redemption upon execution, other than for the debt secured by mortgage upon the premises, vests the estate sold in the purchaser, subject to the payment of the mortgage debt. It is necessarily made for so much less than the property would have sold for had it been unincumbered. The debtor is thereby divested of property apparently sufficient to satisfy the indebtedness secured by the mortgage; and he has a right to demand its application upon the liability. The purchaser is not allowed to take and hold the entire interest in the land, since he purchased, and paid only the value of the equity of redemption. If payment of the mortgage debt is enforced (under such circumstances) from other property of the mortgagor, he will be subrogated to all the rights of the mortgagee, so as to enable him to indemnify himself out of the mortgaged premises.</p> <p id=\"b496-5\" pgmap=\"496\">The application of these well settled rules prevents any injustice to the mortgagor, the mortgagee, or the purchaser. Where such a sale is made upon execution for the whole or a part of the mortgage debt, great difficulties occur in adjusting the rights of parties. In some instances such sales have been* held to be void. Goring's Executor v. Shreve, 7 Dana, 64; Swigest v. Thomas, id. 220; Bronson v. Robinson, 4 B. Mon. 142; Waller v. Tate, id. 529; Atkins v. Sawyer, 1 Pick. 351; Washburn v. Goodwin, 17 Pick. 137; Camp v. Coxe, 1 Dev. and Bat. 52; Powell v. Williams, 14 Ala. 476; Baldwin v. Jenkins, 23 Miss. (1 Cush.), 206.</p> <p id=\"b496-7\" pgmap=\"496\">The law will not suffer a debtor to be divested of his property for the purpose, nominally, of discharging his liabilities, when the manner in which it is sought to be done nowise tends to accomplish that end. It provides appropriate modes for subjecting the property of debtors to the payment of their debts, and it is no hardship upon creditors to require them to pursue those modes. While justice requires that creditors shall have their just dues, it forbids unjust and unnecessarily oppressive modes of obtaining them. The laws of this State, regarding sales under foreclosure of mortgages, were designed to secure to mortgagors the value of their property over and above the mortgage debt, and a sale upon execution for the whole or a part of the same debt would defeat the policy of the law, and utterly destroy the value of an equity of redemption.</p> <p id=\"b496-8\" pgmap=\"496(85) 497(274)\">The interest of a mortgagor subject to a sale upon execution, is ascertained by deducting the amount of the mortgage debt from the value of his pro\u2019perty and a sale of the residuary interest to discharge the debt so deducted would never give to the mortgagor the value of his property over and above the incumbrance. In the case under consideration, McBeynolds did not pay anything for the equity of redemption conveyed to him. He acquired the value of the property over - and above the mortgage debt, by merely canceling a portion of the same. To illustrate: Property worth $5,000 may be mortgaged for only $1,000; now if the equity of redemption is exposed for sale, upon an execution, for the mortgage debt, and the mortgagee becomes the purchaser for $1,000, he would take the property for his debt and deprive the mortgagor of the benefits that might accrue to him if the property were sold in a proper manner to satisfy the indebtedness. But whatever effect the sale under the execution in favor of McReynolds had upon the rights of Tinder, inasmuch as he is now in court and does not question its validity, or justice, we are not called upon to interfere in his behalf. McReynolds, Brittenham, Tinder, or those claiming under them, have never questioned the validity of the sale; and we are not required to assert rights for parties which they do not assert for themselves. Considering, as we must, the sale to be a valid one, until its validity is controverted in some appropriate manner, we are of the opinion that McReynolds acquired the property subject to the payment of a pro rata share of so much of the mortgage debt, as the sale left unsatisfied. The law will not consider the note held by McReynolds, and which fell due April 1, 1848, and the six notes, subsequently acquired by him, extinguished. The whole of the property mortgaged was not sold under the execution in favor of McReynolds, and it was for his interest to keep the notes in force, to preserve Ms lien upon the residue of the property mortgaged.</p> <p id=\"b497-5\" pgmap=\"497\">There is no evidence of any intention on the part of McReynolds to cancel them, or to discharge his lien upon the residue of the property; and as no intention of that kind was manifested, equity will consider the notes as subsisting, or as extinguished, as may be most conducive to his interests. Campbell v. Carter, 14 Ill. 286.</p> <p id=\"b497-6\" pgmap=\"497(56) 498(18)\">The seven notes held by the representatives of McReynolds are a lien upon the mortgaged premises, as well as the judgment and note assigned to the plaintiff in error, and the holders of the same are entitled to a priority in their payment, according to the order of their maturity; the judgment in favor of Britten-ham. taking the place of the note upon which it was rendered. Vansant v. Allmon, 23 Ill. 30.</p> <p id=\"b498-5\" pgmap=\"498\">The judgment in favor of McReynolds was satisfied by his own act, and it is no longer a lien upon the premises. The persons claiming under McReynolds hold the equity of redemption acquired by him, in lieu of so much of the mortgage debt as was canceled. The position of these parties is one chosen by McReynolds, and so long as he and they abide by it, none of them can complain of the consequences. The property, after the liens thereon are discharged, belongs to them, and they have no right to retain Tinder\u2019s equity of redemption with its benefits, and receive that which was surrendered to him for it. The parties claiming under Tinder and McReynolds, respectively, are entitled to have the mortgaged property, if it should be more than sufficient to discharge the liens, exhausted for that purpose ratably, according to the value of the several parcels. \u2022McReynolds was under no obligation to entirely disincumber the land sold to Kelley ; nor was Tinder or Kelley under any obligation regarding them other than such as the law imposed upon them. Under such circumstances, if the property is more than sufficient to satisfy the liens, equity will apportion the incumbrance between the'parties ratably, according to the value of the parcels they hold respectively. The decree of the court below is reversed, and the cause is remanded for further proceedings not inconsistent with this opinion.</p> <p id=\"b498-6\" pgmap=\"498\">Decree reversed.</p> </opinion> </casebody> ",
