She contends that she is the owner of the lot in fee simple, and that her husband, who died before the commencement of this action, had <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"419\">*419</page-number>only a life estate in it. The facts, as they appear in evidence, seem to be as follows: \u2014 John Spohn died in Berks county, in 1820, intestate, leaving a widow and seven children, and seized of considerable real estate, including the lot in dispute here. On the 17th of May 1820, letters of administration were granted to his widow, Maria Spohn, and Adam Spohn, his eldest son. On the 4th of October 1820, an inquisition in the Orphans\u2019 Court, dividing the real estate into three parts, of which No. 1, consisting of the lot in question, valued at $850, was on the 10th of November adjudged to Adam Spohn, who entered into recognizance to secure the shares of the widow and other heirs.</summary>\n<summary data-order=\"19\" data-type=\"summary\" id=\"b419-6\">On the 5th of January 1821, all the heirs refused to accept the remaining purparts at the valuation.

By the agreement a deed was to be executed on or before the 1st of April 1823.</summary>\n<summary data-order=\"24\" data-type=\"summary\" id=\"b419-11\">On the 1st of April 1823, all the other heirs of John Spohn, deceased, conveyed to Solomon Spohn, for the consideration of $1649.19, a tract of 95 acres of land, in Exeter township, part of the estate of John Spohn, deceased, and on the same day all the heirs conveyed 132 acres in same township to Jos.

The existence or non-existence of such a deed is a question of fact for you.</summary>\n<summary data-order=\"29\" data-type=\"summary\" id=\"b420-8\">On the facts to which the court have called your attention depends the question whether the title to the lot was in Ermold or his wife. If in the latter, she is entitled to recover in this action, notwithstanding the sale of the property by the sheriff in 1843, as, the property of Daniel Ermold. The premises were bought at the sale by Charles Feather, under whom the defendants claim. It does not appear that notice of the claim of Sarah Ermold was given at the sale. Evidence has been given of Ermold\u2019s declarations before and after 1840, that the property was not his, but his wife\u2019s. You will judge whether this referred to the mode and proceedings by which the property came into his hands, and is to be regarded as an expression of opinion as to the title, or to what else it referred. If the property was not the wife\u2019s at the time of the declarations, they would not make it so. It is not alleged that Ermold at any time conveyed to her, or in trust for her.</summary>\n<summary data-order=\"30\" data-type=\"summary\" id=\"b420-9\">On the death of John Spohn, his property vested in his children as his heirs, subject to the widow\u2019s rights. When Adam died, and shortly afterwards his mother, Adam\u2019s property went to his surviving brothers and sisters. Sarah Ermold was one of the sisters, and entitled to one sixth part of it. When the others contracted to sell the lot to Daniel Ermold by the article dated in September 1822, for $900, he was to pay for it by allowing so much out of his wife\u2019s share in her deceased father\u2019s estate, if so much should be coming to her ; if not, he was to pay the difference. As to, so much of John Spohn\u2019s estate as had been takemat the appraisement, or sold, Sarah Ermold\u2019s share was money, which could be paid to no other person than to Daniel Ermold, during his life. He could receive it and make valid acquittances for it. He could assign it for money or lands, or any valuable consideration. The land that remained was to be sold either by order of court, or by the parties in interest. In either case it would become money, which Daniel Ermold would be entitled to receive, if living when the land should be sold. The land was actually sold by the parties, and Daniel Ermold receipted for the money with the other <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"421\">*421</page-number>grantors. It was in contemplation of the sale of the land, which had been refused by all the heirs, that Ermold contracted for the purchase of the lot. It was a disposal of the money coming to his wife in anticipation of its receipt from the sale of the lands, and the money was actually in hand at the time he was to get his deed.</summary>\n<summary data-order=\"31\" data-type=\"summary\" id=\"b421-6\">If Ermold had taken this lot at the appraisement, and entered into recognizance to secure the other shares, and had paid the shares by applying his wife\u2019s interest in the recognizance of other heirs, or in the purchase-money of other lands sold, the law would give him five-sixths of the lot in his own right, and he would hold the remainder in the right of his wife. Did he vary his rights by purchasing the shares of the other parties in interest, and agreeing to pay for them with the moneys coming to his wife out of her father\u2019s estate ? We think not. Sarah Ermold\u2019s interest in this lot <em>was as heir to her </em>brother, <em>Adam Spohn. </em>Her husband did not pay for it with any interest of hers in <em>Adam Spohn's </em>property. One sixth part of the lot was hers, as heir to her brother, and that was unaltered by the transaction between Ermold and the other heirs. It was not her interest in the lands of her father with which the lot was paid for. It was with the moneys arising from the sale of those lands, which moneys were the husband\u2019s, if he chose to make them so, either by receiving them, or assigning them, or buying land with them and taking the title in his own name. Where lands are devised to be sold, and the proceeds divided among legatees by the executors, and some of the legatees are married women, and all the legatees elect to take their legacies in land instead of money, it is held that the husbands, by taking deeds in their own names, indicate their intention to reduce the money into possession, in the form of land, and the land becomes their own. This is because the husband in such cases, as in the case before us, had the right to control the money and dispose of it at his pleasure. Daniel Ermold, we think, in his written contract with the other parties in interest, indicated his intention to appropriate his wife\u2019s share of the moneys arising from the sale of her father\u2019s estate to himself, in providing for a conveyance of the land bought with those moneys to himself. \u2022</summary>\n<summary data-order=\"32\" data-type=\"summary\" id=\"b421-7\">Where partition is had among tenants in common, and lands assigned to each, and mutual releases are executed, and some o.f the tenants are femes covert, the property assigned for the shares of the wives belongs to them, and not to their husbands, whether the releases be to the wives or the husbands. In the latter case, the husbands will be regarded as trustees for their wives. This doctrine, however, is confined to cases of partition, in which the consideration for the releases is the land of the wife assigned to the releasor, and not to cases where the 'consideration is money of the wife, which the husband could control and dispose of at <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"422\">*422</page-number>pleasure. No land was assigned to the parties here agreeing to convey to Ermold. The conveyance to Solomon. Spohn was simply a sale for money, and the buyer of the larger tract was a Stranger. Under this agreement, Daniel Ermold became a purchaser in his own right of the shares of the other heirs of Adam Spohn in this lot, although he may have paid for them with the moneys to which his wife was entitled out of her father\u2019s estate. In her own share, which was one sixth part, he acquired no greater interest than a life estate. After his death the title remained in her. Even in cases of partition, it has been held that a deed of release to the husband with a money consideration expressed in it, and containing no notice of the nature of the transaction, would be sufficient to vest in a purchaser of the land at sheriff\u2019s sale, as the land of the husband, without notice, the title and beneficial interest. It is conceded by the defendant\u2019s counsel that the title to one sixth part of this lot is in the plaintiff, and the court think she is entitled to recover that proportion of it in this action.</summary>\n<summary data-order=\"33\" data-type=\"summary\" id=\"b422-6\">Several points of law have been propounded to us by the counsel of the plaintiff, which it is our duty to answer.</summary>\n<summary data-order=\"34\" data-type=\"summary\" id=\"b422-7\">1. That the plaintiff, as one of the heirs of Adam Spohn, deceased, is entitled to one undivided sixth part in the lot in controversy, and that she has a right to recover it in this action.</summary>\n<summary data-order=\"35\" data-type=\"summary\" id=\"b422-8\">2. That if the jury believe that the lot in question was paid for by Daniel Ermold out of the plaintiff\u2019s portion of the proceeds of the lands to which she had a right as one of the heirs of her deceased father, that then the said Daniel Ermold would have but a life estate in the same, and at his death it would belong in fee simple to the plaintiff.</summary>\n<summary data-order=\"36\" data-type=\"summary\" id=\"b422-9\">3. That the article of agreement which was given in evidence was notice to all who claim under Daniel Ermold, that this lot had been paid for with the money of the plaintiff.</summary>\n<summary data-order=\"37\" data-type=\"summary\" id=\"b422-10\">4. That there is no legal proof of the execution of a deed by Solomon Spohn and wife, John Spohn and wife, John Ingham and wife, Philip Rush and wife, and Jacob Kerlin and wife, to Daniel Ermold.</summary>\n<summary data-order=\"38\" data-type=\"summary\" id=\"b422-11\">5. That under the article of agreement which has been given in evidence, th,e plaintiff is entitled to the two undivided sixth parts in said lot, to which John Spohn and Solomon Spohn had the right, as heirs of Adam Spohn, deceased, if the jury believe that Daniel Ermold paid for the\u2019 same with the lands of plaintiff.</summary>\n<summary data-order=\"39\" data-type=\"summary\" id=\"b422-12\">1. To the plaintiff\u2019s first point, we answer as requested. The plaintiff is entitled to recover one undivided sixth part of the lot in controversy.</summary>\n<summary data-order=\"40\" data-type=\"summary\" id=\"b422-13\">2. We answer this point in the negative. We are of opinion that such payment as is herein suggested would vest the title of the property in Daniel Ermold, except as to the one sixth part to which the plaintiff was entitled rs heir to Adam Spohn.</summary>\n<summary data-order=\"41\" data-type=\"summary\" id=\"b423-5\"><page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"423\">*423</page-number>,3. This point is answered in the affirmative. The law is as herein stated.</summary>\n<summary data-order=\"42\" data-type=\"summary\" id=\"b423-6\">4. In the opinion of the court, there is legal proof of the execution of the deed mentioned in this point in the testimony of the witnesses who have been sworn to the fact: whether the execution of such a deed be sufficiently established is a question of fact for the jury.</summary>\n<summary data-order=\"43\" data-type=\"summary\" id=\"b423-7\">5. If the jury believe that the shares mentioned in this point were paid for by Daniel Ermold with the lands of the plaintiff, she would be entitled to these shares, unless the jury should be of opinion that a deed was executed to Daniel Ermold by the other heirs, expressing the conveyance to be for a money consideration, and affording no notice that the consideration, of the conveyance was the land of the plaintiff; but if the jury believe that these shares were paid for with the proceeds of lands sold under order of the Orphans\u2019 Court, or by the heirs, to which she was entitled, then she is not entitled to the shares. The facts of the whole case are for the jury, and the court do not wish to be understood as giving any binding directions with regard to them. To this opinion of the court, the plaintiff by her counsel excepts, and requests that the same may be filed of record, which is accordingly done.</summary>\n<summary data-order=\"44\" data-type=\"summary\" id=\"b423-8\">It was assigned for error, that the court erred in charging the jury:</summary>\n<summary data-order=\"45\" data-type=\"summary\" id=\"b423-9\">1. That \u201c under the agreement, Daniel Ermold became a purchaser in his own right of the shares of the other heirs of Adam Spohn in this lot, although he may have paid for them out of the money to which his wife was entitled out of her father\u2019s estate, and in the answers to the plaintiff\u2019s second point.\u201d</summary>\n<summary data-order=\"46\" data-type=\"summary\" id=\"b423-10\">2. That \u201cit was not her interest in the lands of her father with which the lot was paid for. It was with the moneys arising from the sale of those lands, which moneys were the husband\u2019s, if he chose to make them so, either by receiving them, or buying lands with them and taking the title in his own name.\u201d</summary>\n<summary data-order=\"47\" data-type=\"summary\" id=\"b423-11\">3. In answer to the plaintiff\u2019s fourth point, that in the opinion of the court there is legal proof of the execution of the deed mentioned in this point, in the testimony of the witnesses who have sworn to the fact.</summary>\n<summary data-order=\"48\" data-type=\"summary\" id=\"b423-12\">4. In the answer to the plaintiff\u2019s fifth point, that <em>\u201c </em>if the jury believe that the shares mentioned in this point were paid for by Daniel Ermold with the lands of the plaintiff, she would be entitled to those shares, unless the jury should he of opinion that a deed was executed to Daniel Ermold by the other heirs, expressing the conveyance to be for a money consideration, and affording no notice that the consideration of the conveyance was the land of the plaintiff; but, if the jury believe that these shares were paid for <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"424\">*424</page-number>with the proceeds of lands sold under order of the Orphans\u2019 Court, or by the heirs, to which she was entitled, then she is not entitled to the shares.\u201d</summary>\n<attorneys data-order=\"49\" data-type=\"attorneys\" id=\"b424-6\"><em>BanJes </em>and <em>Hoffman, </em>for plaintiif in error.</attorneys>\n<p data-order=\"50\" data-type=\"legal\" id=\"AqR\">The wife relinquished by the agreement her right to the one sixth part of her patrimony, so far as it was necessary to pay for this lot, and thus furnished the consideration for it and the means of paying its price. '</p>\n<p data-order=\"51\" data-type=\"legal\" id=\"b424-7\">She was the meritorious person and the party to be benefited. The object was partition of the lands among the heirs as far as possible. Her husband, by being the party to the agreement, took the title to the lot in dispute as her trustee. Her land, which was the fund for payment, was her separate estate, as much so as money settled to her separate use, which, of itself, secures to her a trust estate by implication of law. Her land was conveyed in payment. Her object was not to part with its value, but to secure to herself a portion of its equivalent in the land.</p>\n<p data-order=\"52\" data-type=\"legal\" id=\"b424-8\">When a husband takes his wife\u2019s purpart in land, and it is of less value than her share of the estate, the husband, having nothing to pay out of his own funds, acquires but a life estate : Snavely <em>v. </em>Wagner, 3 <em>Barr </em>275; 8 <em>id. </em>397; 5 <em>id. </em>216-19; 7 <em>Watts </em>217, Duncan <em>v. </em>Clark; 3 <em>W. &amp; Ser. </em>520, Weeks <em>v. </em>Haas; 9 <em>id. </em>131, Kaufman <em>v. </em>Crawford.</p>\n<p data-order=\"53\" data-type=\"legal\" id=\"b424-9\">In the case of Weeks <em>v. </em>Haas, Chief Justice Gibson says that the law raises a resulting trust in favor of the person whose money pays for the land.</p>\n<p data-order=\"54\" data-type=\"legal\" id=\"b424-10\">In that case, the chief justice says \u2014 \u201cBy relinquishing her right in the two-thirds of her patrimony, she furnished the consideration for it; and as she was the party to be benefited, the object being <em>partition, and not conversion, </em>the law raises a presumption that the husband took the legal title of her share as her trustee, for the same reason that it raises a resulting trust of land paid for with the money of another. With what did he pay ? Certainly with his wife\u2019s land for all but an inconsiderable part of the value, and this land was as much her separate estate as money settled to her separate use, which, had it been the consideration, would have given her an indisputable trust estate by implication of law. Why then shall not the law imply such a trust estate when her land has been qonveyed in payment, and the object is not to part with the value of it, but to reserve or take back an equivalent.\u201d</p>\n<p data-order=\"55\" data-type=\"legal\" id=\"b424-11\">In the case of Kaufman <em>v. </em>Crawford, it was ruled that where husbands had procured deeds for the lands of their wives by virtue of a sale by executors where the money was to be divided among testator\u2019s daughters, and divided the lands, and executed deeds to <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"425\">*425</page-number>each other, the husbands acquired nothing but the naked legal title, and upon their deaths the fee remained in their wives.</p>\n<attorneys data-order=\"56\" data-type=\"attorneys\" id=\"b425-6\"><em>Smith, </em>contra.</attorneys>\n<p data-order=\"57\" data-type=\"legal\" id=\"A1EG\">In the court below, the plaintiff in error claimed to recover, first, one-sixth; secondly, three-sixths, and the whole. The defendants admitted that she was entitled to recover her own share in the estate of her brother Adam Spohn, deceased, being one-sixth.</p>\n<p data-order=\"58\" data-type=\"legal\" id=\"b425-7\">The case under consideration was <em>a sale </em>by the heirs of Adam Spohn, deceased, to Daniel Ermold, <em>and not a partition. </em>At the sheriff\u2019s sale, no notice was given of Sarah Ermold\u2019s title. The purchaser at sheriff\u2019s sale took the title, after seeing the deed made and executed in the usual form.</p>\n<p data-order=\"59\" data-type=\"legal\" id=\"b425-8\">When Adam Spohn accepted of the lot in dispute, and entered into a recognizance for the payment of his brothers and sisters, the title became vested in him, and he became indebted to each of them for a seventh part of the valuation money, for which they had a lien on the house and lot. But as soon as he died, the same descended to them as his heirs, and the indebtedness and lien were extinguished by operation of law. Where the same hand is to receive and pay, the debt is paid by operation of law.</p>\n<p data-order=\"60\" data-type=\"legal\" id=\"b425-9\">Land charged with the payment of an annuity, descending to the annuitant, the annuity is discharged: Hefferman <em>v. </em>Adams, 9 <em>Watts </em>529; 2 <em>Pierre Williams </em>604.</p>\n<p data-order=\"61\" data-type=\"legal\" id=\"b425-10\">If the plaintiff in a judgment becomes the owner of the land upon which the judgment is a lien, the lien is extinct by operation of law: Koons <em>v. </em>Hartman, 7 <em>Watts </em>20.</p>\n<p data-order=\"62\" data-type=\"legal\" id=\"b425-11\">If partition be made between tenants in common, who <em>we femes covert, </em>and mutual releases be executed to the husbands, the husbands hold in trust for their wives: Weeks <em>v. </em>Haas, 3 <em>Watts &amp; Ser. </em>520. But if the release do not recite the partition, but a moneyed consideration, a purchaser from the husband, without notice, would hold the property : <em>Id. </em>Where the object is partition, <em>and not conversion, </em>the husband would be trustee for his wife. Opinion of Gibson, C. J., 3 <em>W. &amp; Ser. </em>522.</p>\n<p data-order=\"63\" data-type=\"legal\" id=\"b425-13\">In Kintzer <em>v. </em>Mitchell, 5 <em>Barr </em>216, 219, and 8 <em>Barr </em>81-82, notice of the wife\u2019s title was brought home to the purchaser.</p>\n<p data-order=\"64\" data-type=\"legal\" id=\"b425-14\">Where, in partition in the Orphans\u2019 Court, the real estate cannot be divided into as many parts as there are heirs, and a husband of one of the heirs accepts in right of his wife, and enters into a recognizance to pay the valuation money, and pays the heirs their share of the valuation money with his wife\u2019s share of the valuation money of other purparts, he acquires a fee simple to all but his wife\u2019s share: Snavely <em>v. </em>Wagner, 8 <em>Barr </em>396.</p>\n<p data-order=\"65\" data-type=\"legal\" id=\"b425-15\">In Kaufman <em>v. </em>Crawford, 9 <em>W. &amp; Ser. </em>131, the title-papers disclosed the wife\u2019s interest.</p>\n<opinion data-order=\"66\" data-type=\"opinion\" id=\"x999-1\" type=\"majority\">\n<p id=\"b426-5\"><page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"426\">*426</page-number>The opinion of the court was delivered June 30, by</p>\n<author id=\"b426-6\">Bell, J.</author>\n<p id=\"APE\">The view taken by the President of the Common Pleas, of the interest acquired by Daniel Ermold, under the undisputed facts of the case, is entirely correct.</p>\n<p id=\"b426-7\">The distinction is between partition and conversion. When the former is the object, the husband takes but a life estate in the land not actually paid for with his own proper funds ; but where the estate of the wife is actually converted, the proceeds become the property of the husband by an application of them to his own purposes. Here, it is in uncontradicted proof that the lands which descended from the wife\u2019s father <em>were actually sold and </em>conveyed, and the money arising from them applied in purchase of the house and lot conveyed or to be conveyed to the husband. This fact brings the case within the distinction pointed .out in Weeks <em>v. </em>Haas, 3 <em>W. &amp; Ser. </em>520. Besides, the property in dispute came to the plaintiff immediately from Adam her brother, and not from her father. It is therefore not within the purview of the cases cited for the plaintiff.</p>\n<p id=\"b426-8\">Under this aspect of the case, it is immaterial whether a deed was actually executed to the husband, or not, and consequently indifferent whether what the court said upon that point be well founded. Judgment affirmed.</p>\n</opinion>\n</casebody>\n",
