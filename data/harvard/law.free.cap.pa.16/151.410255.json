This report finds $3857.05, <em>in the hands of accountant as of 18th of November </em>1847, <em>day of exhibition of the account, but does not find or charge accountant with interest on that sum. </em>Nor does the Orphans\u2019 Court charge interest. <em>Both court and auditor expressly avoid doing so, </em>and the report and decree thus <em>disallow interest, </em>and report $3857.05 <em>as in accountant\u2019s hands.</em></p>\n<p data-order=\"18\" data-type=\"legal\" id=\"b152-6\">The auditor of distribution wras clearly unauthorized to charge interest; he was going beyond the report and decree of the court, and thus in <em>effect reversing their decree.</em></p>\n<p data-order=\"19\" data-type=\"legal\" id=\"b152-7\">This decree was confirmed by the Supreme Court, and could not in <em>any way be altered or added to. </em>It was conclusive on the subject-matter.</p>\n<p data-order=\"20\" data-type=\"legal\" id=\"b152-8\">Again, even if open, no interest can be charged against an administrator, &amp;c., while his accounts are pending before auditors: 8 <em>Watts </em>73, Hoopes <em>v. </em>Brinton; 5 <em>Barr </em>413, Stehman\u2019s Appeal.</p>\n<attorneys data-order=\"21\" data-type=\"attorneys\" id=\"b152-9\"><em>Stephens, </em>contra.</attorneys>\n<p data-order=\"22\" data-type=\"legal\" id=\"Apa\">There was no evidence before the auditor of distribution, that the administrator had <em>not </em>used the money in his hands. The confirmation of the report of the auditor that he had a balance of $3857.05 in his hands in November 1847, was a decree for the aggregate amount of principal and interest. He referred to Yundt\u2019s Appeal, 1 <em>Harris.</em></p>\n<opinion data-order=\"23\" data-type=\"opinion\" id=\"x999-1\" type=\"majority\">\n<p id=\"b152-10\">The opinion of the court was delivered May 23, by</p>\n<author id=\"b152-11\">Rogers, J.</author>\n<p id=\"A8T\">The auditor appointed to distribute the assets, in ascertaining the amount in the hands of the administrator, to be distributed, is confined to the decree of the Orphans\u2019 Court. He cannot go behind the decree for the purpose of increasing or diminishing the sum there ascertained. This is indubitable, and therefore the only question here is as to the construction of the decree; that is, has the court decreed the sum to be paid as $3857.05, or have they decreed that sum with the addition of interest; the auditor, to ascertain the amount of the assets having reported that sum in the hands of accountant, as of the day of the exhibition of his account, to wit, the 18th day of November 1847. It is very certain that'the auditor might, if he had thought proper, have charged the accountant with interest on the money in his hands, and perhaps ought to have done so, particularly in the absence of proof that it had not been used by accountant, or that it was lying idle, leaving it open to the natural presumption that the money was applied to his own purposes. But although he might, yet it is clear he has not done so. He seems to have left the question of interest to be settled by the court. The charge of interest as against an administrator, is not a matter of right, a ne<page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"153\">*153</page-number>cessary consequence of money being in his hands; but depends on a variety of circumstances, such, for example, as the money being needed for the payment of debts, or other purposes connected with the settlement of the estate. If, therefore, it was the intention of the auditor, that interest should be added, it ought to have formed part of the report. The Orphans\u2019 Court, instead of passing upon the question of interest, which they had unquestionable power to do, have confined themselves (purposely, we suppose,) to a simple confirmation of the report. The entry is that the report was excepted to, and, on the 20th August 1849, was confirmed. This decree, we apprehend, cannot relate back to the 18th November 1847, for the purpose of\u2019charging the accountant with interest, but must be considered as a decree of the 20th August 1849, when the auditor\u2019s report was confirmed by the Orphans\u2019 Court. Had the auditor given interest, a simple confirmation of the report would carry interest. But having omitted, or purposely avoided doing so, which is the same thing, we cannot see how it can be viewed as a decree for more than is contained in the report itself. It does not purport to go beyond the report, and must be confined to that. It is highly probable that if the attention of the Orphans\u2019 Court had been directed to it, and a special decree in the proper form been made, as ought to be the practice of that court, the accountant would have been charged with interest. But this is not certainly so; the accountant might have shown circumstances which would exempt him from the payment of interest. As no mention is made of interest, either by the auditor or the court, we cannot undertake to charge the administrator on probability or conjecture. There was error therefore in charging accountant with interest from the 18th November 1847.</p>\n<p id=\"b153-6\">But is the accountant chargeable with interest at all, and if so, from what time ? That an administrator is chargeable with interest from the decree cannot be doubted. In that respect a decree is like a judgment, to which interest, in this State, is a necessary incident. The decree of the Orphans\u2019 Court was made the 20th August 1849; and from that time, the accountant is chargeable with interest on the sum of $3857.05, (the amount decreed to be paid,) up to the time of the affirmance of the decree, to wit, the 1st day of July 1850. The interest is thus to be calculated on the aggregate sum of principal and interest, from the said 1st July 1850, until this time. It seems that the administrator appealed on the 10th September 1849; and July 1, 1850, the decree was affirmed by the Supreme Court. It must be remarked that in this court, as well as in the Orphans\u2019 Court, a loose practice has prevailed as to decrees on appeals, which ought to be corrected. Instead of ascertaining the amount due, and making a special decree, the decree is usually entered, \u201cdecree confirmed.\u201d The proceedings are then <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"154\">*154</page-number>remitted to the Orphans\u2019 Court to carry the decree into effect, giving interest from the time of the decree in the Orphans\u2019 Court.</p>\n<p id=\"b154-6\">And now to wit, this 23d day of May 1851, after argument and due consideration, it is ordered and decreed that accountant be charged with the sum of four thousand two hundred and seventy-five dollars and forty-one cents, principal and interest in his hands. Record remitted to the Orphans\u2019 Court to carry this decree into effect, by distributing the amount so decreed to the persons entitled to the same according to the decree of the Orphans\u2019 Court.
