In a suit on a recognizance in the Orphans\u2019 Court given by an heir who took one of three purparts at the appraisement, executed in favor of the Commonwealth for the payment to the other heirs their proportional shares in the purpart, it was admissible for the recognizor, the defendant, under the plea of payment with leave to show that one of the other purparts, not taken at the appraisement, was sold by a trustee under order of the Orphans\u2019 Court, and that all of the balance of the proceeds, after payment of debts of the intestate, was paid to the plaintiff, and that the defendant in the suit never made any objection. The fact whether or not it was received as part payment, should have been submitted to the jury.</headnotes>\n<headnotes data-order=\"2\" data-type=\"headnotes\" id=\"b426-11\">2. Such a recognizance should be sued in the name of the Commonwealth as the legal party, though it is proper that'the name of the persons suing, should be stated on the record. A mistake however, in this respect, will not furnish a defen\u00f3e against the Commonwealth, as the court should look to the distribution of the amount recovered. The judgment should not be for the <em>penalty, </em>but for the amount of the interest of those suing.</headnotes>\n<headnotes data-order=\"3\" data-type=\"headnotes\" id=\"b426-12\">\u25a0 3.

This was the sixth bill.</summary>\n<summary data-order=\"32\" data-type=\"summary\" id=\"b430-6\">Gordon, J., charged: \u2014 This is a scire facias in the name of the Commonwealth of Pennsylvania against Mary Kidd, on a recognizance in the Orphans\u2019 Court of Berks county, entered into by the defendant to secure the payment of purparts or shares of the other heirs of John Kidd, deceased, in land taken at the appraisement in said court by the defendant, Mary Kidd, who was a sister of the deceased. The Commonwealth is the plaintiff in the action, which is brought for the use of the children of Lydia Moore, who was a sister of the decedent John Kidd. The defence made here has reference to the manner in which the suit is brought. It is purely a legal or technical defence, and will sufficiently appear in the points of law submitted to the court by the defendant\u2019s counsel. Your verdict will be regulated by the answers given to these points by the court.</summary>\n<summary data-order=\"33\" data-type=\"summary\" id=\"b430-7\">Points submitted on part of the defendant were as follow:\u2014</summary>\n<summary data-order=\"34\" data-type=\"summary\" id=\"b430-8\">1. That the action cannot be sustained by joining four of the five claiming under the recognizance, and claiming a joint verdict for four. If a specific sum is claimed, each heir should sue for him or herself.</summary>\n<summary data-order=\"35\" data-type=\"summary\" id=\"b430-9\">2. If the action can be sustained in the name of the Commonwealth of Pennsylvania, as a trustee for the recognizors, without their appearing on the record, then the verdict and judgment should be for the penalty of the recognizance according to the praecipe and scire facias.</summary>\n<summary data-order=\"36\" data-type=\"summary\" id=\"b430-10\">3. The recognizance being given, and made payable to the heirs of John Kidd respectively and severally, the cause of action upon it is several, and the verdict and judgment should be for the specific amount due to each, and must be specifically assigned in the breach of the scire facias.</summary>\n<summary data-order=\"37\" data-type=\"summary\" id=\"b430-11\">The first point the court answer in the negative. The Commonwealth is the plaintiff, and as such entitled to recover the shares of those who sue in her name. The respective shares of those for whom she sues in the sum recovered can be adjusted after recovery. There is no question here of joinder or non-joinder of parties. The Commonwealth is the only legal party, and the number of persons for whose use the action is marked is quite immaterial, except that in this action it furnishes information to the court and jury as to the sum for which the verdict should be rendered.</summary>\n<summary data-order=\"38\" data-type=\"summary\" id=\"b430-12\">2. The verdict should not be for the penalty of the recognizance, but for the aggregate of the sums due to those who have brought this action in the name of the Commonwealth for their use. IV ho they are appears in the scire facias and the papers given in evi<page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"431\">*431</page-number>dence. If there be other claimants under this recognizance not suing here, the verdict and judgment in this action will be no bar to their recovery of whatever may appear to be due to them in actions to be instituted for their use.</summary>\n<summary data-order=\"39\" data-type=\"summary\" id=\"b431-6\">3. The recognizance is not given and made payable to the heirs of John Kidd respectively and severally, as supposed in this point, but to the Commonwealth of Pennsylvania ; and it is competent for any one or more' of those for whose use it was taken to sue in the name of the Commonwealth for their shares, severally for the shares of each, or aggregately for the shares of those suing. The verdict in this case ought\" not to be for the specific amount due <em>to each </em>heir, <em>but for the amount due to all the heirs for whose use the action is brought.</em></summary>\n<summary data-order=\"40\" data-type=\"summary\" id=\"b431-7\">With this view of the law, the court are of opinion that <em>the plaintiff </em>is entitled to recover.</summary>\n<summary data-order=\"41\" data-type=\"summary\" id=\"b431-8\">To this opinion of the court, the defendant by her counsel excepted.</summary>\n<summary data-order=\"42\" data-type=\"summary\" id=\"b431-9\">November 13, 1850, a verdict was rendered for $1980.</summary>\n<summary data-order=\"43\" data-type=\"summary\" id=\"b431-10\">It was assigned for error:</summary>\n<summary data-order=\"44\" data-type=\"summary\" id=\"b431-11\">1; The court erred in refusing to swear the jury as requested by defendant\u2019s counsel.</summary>\n<summary data-order=\"45\" data-type=\"summary\" id=\"b431-12\">2. There was error in the admission of the evidence mentioned in the second bill of exception.</summary>\n<summary data-order=\"46\" data-type=\"summary\" id=\"b431-13\">3. There was error in the rejection of evidence mentioned in the third bill of exceptions.</summary>\n<summary data-order=\"47\" data-type=\"summary\" id=\"b431-14\">4. There was error in the rejection of the evidence in the fourth bill of exceptions.</summary>\n<summary data-order=\"48\" data-type=\"summary\" id=\"b431-15\">5. There was error in the rejection of the evidence proposed'in the fifth and sixth bills of exceptions.</summary>\n<summary data-order=\"49\" data-type=\"summary\" id=\"b431-16\">6. The court erred in their answers to the defendant\u2019s points. They should have answered in the affirmative.</summary>\n<summary data-order=\"50\" data-type=\"summary\" id=\"b431-17\">7. The charge is generally erroneous \u2014 and especially in directing the jury to render a verdict for one-third of the valuation of the purpart No. 1, instead of for the penalty, or for the claim of <em>one </em>heir only.</summary>\n<attorneys data-order=\"51\" data-type=\"attorneys\" id=\"b431-18\">The case was argued by <em>Hoffman </em>and <em>Banhs, </em>for plaintiff in error.</attorneys>\n<p data-order=\"52\" data-type=\"legal\" id=\"ApOU\">The evidence was admissible. It proved payment to the plaintiff. <em>Debt </em>on recognizance is the <em>proper </em>form of action. <em>Sci. fa. </em>sustained upon the <em>practice: </em>Blanchard <em>v. </em>Com\u2019th, 6 <em>Watts </em>311\u201412; Good <em>v. </em>Good, 7 <em>Watts </em>159. The recognizance changed the property from real to personal: 1 <em>Jones </em>374. It passed, upon the death of Robert Alexander, to his administrator, and not to William Moore as surviving heir: Lee <em>v. </em>Wright, 1 <em>Rawle </em>149. The action is brought for the penalty, but for. four of the five recognizees, and the verdict is for a specific sum; whereas the verdict should have been for the penalty in the first instance, and for the <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"432\">*432</page-number>specific amount due to each plaintiff for whose use the suit was brought. - An obligation given to several co-obligees jointly cannot be sued by some of the obligees and omitting others.

The suit is properly brought in the name of the legal plaintiff for the use of the parties interested.</p>\n<p data-order=\"56\" data-type=\"legal\" id=\"b432-8\">\"Where the parties having a beneficial interest in a suit appear on the record, the court will recognise them as such, and treat them accordingly. But it is not necessary to the validity of a judgment that such parties should appear upon the record. If there be <em>legal </em>parties, it is sufficient: Reigart et al. <em>v. </em>Ellmaker, 6 <em>Ser. &amp; R. </em>45.</p>\n<p data-order=\"57\" data-type=\"legal\" id=\"b432-9\">The parties interested have a right to the name of the commonwealth in a scire facias on the recognizance given by a sheriff: Brownfield <em>v. </em>Com\u2019th for use, &amp;c., 13 <em>Ser. &amp; R. </em>268.</p>\n<p data-order=\"58\" data-type=\"legal\" id=\"b432-10\">A legal title is certainly sufficient for the maintenance of an action, except, perhaps, where the commonwealth stands as a trustee in an official bond, and then it may be necessary to show a particular injury as a title to her interference, in order to secure the obligor from an officious intermeddling. The equitable owner of a right of action can recover on the legal title only, and any one attempting to use it a second time would be repulsed at once by a plea of former recovery: Armstrong <em>v. </em>City of Lancaster, 5 <em>Watts </em>69.</p>\n<p data-order=\"59\" data-type=\"legal\" id=\"b432-11\">In an action upon a recognizance taken by the <em>Orphans\u2019 </em>Court, in the name of the'commonwealth, to secure the payment of money, brought for the use of another, proof by the defendant that the person to whose use the suit is brought is not entitled to the money furnishes no defence to the recovery by the legal plaintiff.

Its exclusion, we are told, was put upon the ground that as it did not appear the payment by Miller to Keim was made with the assent of Mary Kidd, the former was subject to her action for her proportion of the funds, and consequently there was no such privity in respect of this transaction established between her and the wards as would entitle her to regard them as debtors; or, secondly, if they may be regarded as standing in that relation, the proffered defence must be treated as set-off, which was not available for want of the proper plea and notice, and because the claim is barred by the statute of limitations. But we are persuaded this view of the ground occupied by the defendant is incorrect. At the time when Miller handed over to Keim, as guardian, the balance remaining in his hands, after payment of the intestate\u2019s debts, both Mrs. Kidd and Mrs. Shoemaker were indebted to the children of their deceased sister for their shares of the valuation of purparts Nos. 1 and 3, adjudged by the Orphans\u2019 Court to the surviving sisters. All the parties for whose use the action is brought, being minors, were then represented by Keim, as their guardian, who in that capacity received the money in question. He subsequently accounted for the sum so received, to his wards, for a part of the offered proof was that becoming embarrassed, he placed the money paid him by Miller in the hands of one Stichter for the use of the minors, and it was, long after the commencement of this suit, paid to William Moore, as the survivor of his brothers and sisters, by virtue of an order of the Orphans\u2019 Court, made upon his application. At the moment of the payment to Keim, he, Miller, and the surviving sisters lived in the same town, and it is obvious, from the accounts settled by Miller as trustee, and by Mary Kidd, the defendant, as administrator of the intestate\u2019s estate, as well as from the general circumstances attending the transaction, that the parties interested were aware of the disposition made by the trustee of the money which had come to his hands. Yet, though still living, it is not asserted that either Mrs. Kidd or her sister, Mrs. Shoemaker, ever called upon Miller to pay to them their proportions of the sale made by him, or in any manner indicated they esteemed him their debtor. More than ten years have</p>\n<p id=\"AYt\">\u25a0 <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"434\">*434</page-number>run since the money was handed to Keim, and at the end of that period we find one of Mrs. Moore\u2019s children, who, as representing the others, is the active prosecutor of this suit, claiming and actually enforcing payment of the sum received by his guardian, as money belonging to the wards. Surely, the facts I have imperfectly detailed afford sufficient ground for the inference that payment was made by Miller to Keim, and received by the latter with the knowledge and assent of the surviving sisters, as a payment on account of their indebtedness to the wards. Indeed, under the circumstances, it is difficult, if not impossible, to escape this conclusion, more especially as the defendant below-now so avers, and the party beneficially interested as plaintiff claims the fund as belonging to him. As showing or tending to show payments, the offered proof was strictly admissible under the plea of payment, and, we think, ought ,at least so to have been submitted to the jury. The refusal to permit that branch of the trying tribunal to say whether the actors in the transaction did not so intend it, was consequently erroneous. I may add, it would be a subject of regret were a defence <em>pro tanto, </em>apparently so meritorious, defeated by the unnecessary application of a mere technical reason.</p>\n<p id=\"b434-6\">In every other particular, the action of the Court of Common Pleas is correct. A recognizance taken in the Orphans\u2019 Court, after proceedings in partition, is unlike a sheriff\u2019s recognizance or an official bond, where the remedy is regulated by statute. It is simply a common-law obligation of record, taken in the name of the commonwealth, for the security of the several parties-in interest. But the commonwealth is, properly, the conusee, and therefore the legal title to sue resides in her. In every instance the action is properly brought in her name, and may be sustained without the suggestion of any other. But as each individual having an interest in the recognizance may use the name of the commonwealth to enforce that interest, convenience requires the name of the <em>cestui que use </em>who sues to be suggested of record; and this is constantly done where the proceeding is instituted by any less than the whole number of claimants: Good <em>v. </em>Good, 7 <em>Watts </em>199. Perhaps in every instance, the name of the party suing ought to be noted, since it seems the judgment should not be for the penalty, but for the precise sum found to be due to the individual or individuals: Stewart <em>v. </em>Martin, 2 <em>Watts </em>200. But even a mistake in this particular furnishes no defence against the legal plaintiff. To the defendant it is of no consequence who claims the money, since the court will look to its proper distribution after recovery : Commonwealth <em>v. </em>Lightner, 9 <em>W. &amp; Ser. </em>117; though doubtless the interference of a mere intruder without pretence of equitable title, would be forbidden.</p>\n<p id=\"b434-7\">It is objected here, that more than one, and less than the whole number of persons interested, are marked of record as <em>cestuis </em><page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"435\">*435</page-number><em>que use. </em>And what of that <em>? </em>The cases show that' one of several may proceed under the recognizance,, and why not any number less than all ? There could be no question of mis-joinder or non-joinder, for the Commonwealth is always the legal party; and as the recognizance is taken' for the security of each and all there is no technical difficulty] nor any objection in principle against suggesting the names of as many equitable claimants as choose to join. By the settled rule, they will recover just so much of the whole fund as they may show themselves entitled to, leaving the balance for those of the remaining parties who may afterwards sue. It was ruled in one of the cases already cited, that judgment, in such an instance, ought not to be given for the penal sum, as a cautionary judgment is unnecessary. It would follow from this that the verdict rendered below' for an aggregate sum, specifically due to the named <em>cestuis que </em>use, is in accordance with established practice. I may remark, in conclusion, that there would seem to be great propriety in the joinder of parties complained of here, since they represented one share of the estate. That the court was right in refusing to discriminate between them on the application of the defendant, or swear the jury in a particular way, is too plain for remark. Even had a mistake been committed in this point, I do not see how it could have affected the defendant injuriously. Judgment reversed.</p>\n</opinion>\n</casebody>\n",
