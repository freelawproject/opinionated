I herewith annex and refer to a printed copy (marked X) and make it a part of this my deposition, which said printed copy is a true one to the best of my knowledge and belief. I sold to Wood a tract of land containing 412 acres, with the allowance of <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"30\">*30</page-number>six per cent. The printed copy (marked X) will describe the land I sold to Wood. The original contract was in writing. I had a conversation with Wood, preparatory to the completion of the contract, which conversation was in Baltimore, Md., and I then told bim that the tract contained 412 acres, with the allowance, and I showed him a plot or draft of a survey, which I believe now to be the one marked A, which was the one, and the only one, I delivered to Wood, August 9, 1838, to run the lines by, which was produced to me on my examination before arbitrators, in the case of Jones <em>v. </em>Wood, at West Chester, Pa., March 19, 1846, the courses and distances of the black lines on which corresponded with those of the deed from James Taylor to Robert Annan, dated October 22, 1799, under which the latter held the Annan farm. And I also told him that the part marked on the plot by dotted lines,, outside of the black lines, on the Chester county side of the farm, was vacant land, which I had not thought it worth while to take up, but he (Wood) might take it up if he thought proper \u2014 that the 412 acres and allowances were all I had to sell. I showed him the deed, and told him the deed was made from the plot or draft I gave him. I also informed him that there had been an altercation between Thompson and my father about one of the lines, and that if I accepted of his offer of $10,000, he must make out the lines as nearly as he could by the plot, but that if he would give me $25 an acre I would be responsible for the lines.</summary>\n<summary data-order=\"46\" data-type=\"summary\" id=\"b30-6\">I gave him the plot to take home to run the lines by, and told him expressly that the lines must be run by it; and I also told him that he must do the best he could with the lines marked on the plot, which I also gave him. The tract was sold to him for 412 acres, that he must take it at that with allowance, be the same more or less. Wood lived near the tract. The vacant land was never known as a part of the Annan farm; it was always known as vacant land.</summary>\n<summary data-order=\"47\" data-type=\"summary\" id=\"b30-7\">By the request of Wood, I made the deed to Jones on April 2d or 3d, 1839, and received from Jones $3000 in cash, and took his bond secured by mortgage for $7000, payable at the end of six years, with interest to be paid annually.</summary>\n<summary data-order=\"48\" data-type=\"summary\" id=\"b30-8\">In the autumn of 1838, I took out a warrant for 40 acres of vacant land, and had it laid on by the deputy county surveyor, adjoining the land which I had sold to Wood and conveyed to Jones, under which warrant I sold the piece of vacant land as surveyed, to Jones, in the beginning of April 1839, for $400, and made the deed to him for it.</summary>\n<summary data-order=\"49\" data-type=\"summary\" id=\"b30-9\">Thomas Wood was fully aware of my taking up said vacant land, and selling and conveying it to Jones. He was aware of it in April 1839, because I refused to convey it in the deed of the large tract, and I supposed, at the time I executed the deed, that it did not include any part of the vacant land. * * * I suppose he must <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"31\">*31</page-number>have been aware of it in the fall of 1838. * * * I told Wood if he would give me $25 an acre, I would make out the lines by the 412 acre survey as nearly as possible, and would charge for no more than I could make a title for. * * * The dispute between my father and Thompson about one of the lines, which dispute, I believe, involved a part of the 412 acre survey, was the chief reason why I made the offer I did to Wood. I also thought that there possibly might be a difficulty with the Loves and Tweeds, and my intention was rather to give up small strips than go to law. * * * On the Chester county side is a <em>road; </em>a field is cut off running east and west; that field was farmed by my father. * * * That field must have had in it a portion of the vacant land. I did not know, when I lived with my father, that any portion of that field was vacant land, nor did I learn it at any time prior to the sale. * * * I know of no such deed from Colonel James Taylor to the Rev. Robert Annan, dated October 22, 1799, for 28 acres, and do not believe there ever was such a valid deed, because there never was a warrant or survey upon wffiich to base it. There was but the one deed from Colonel Taylor for the 412 acres. * * *1 don\u2019t think any part of the vacant land was enclosed, except so far as this field goes, (the field before spoken of.) * * * I did not know that my brothers had cut timber off the vacant land; neither did I know the vacant land ran down into the field, till Whitson surveyed it for Wood. * * * I lived on the farm (Annan\u2019s) about a couple of years. It was about 1814 or 1815. I went to Europe in 1817. * * * My father owned and lived on the farm at that time. * * * I handed the title-papers of the Annan farm over to Jones. There was no deed among them from Colonel James Taylor to the Rev. Robert Annan, for 28 acres, dated October 22, 1799. * * * There was but one deed from Colonel James Taylor to my father, among the papers of my father, for parts or the whole of the Annan farm, and there were not two deeds.</summary>\n<summary data-order=\"50\" data-type=\"summary\" id=\"b31-7\">The defendant then proved the loss of the plot (marked A) referred to by Dr. Annan.</summary>\n<summary data-order=\"51\" data-type=\"summary\" id=\"b31-8\">Moses Whitson was examined on the part of defendant, and proved that he was called on in the latter part of 1838, he thought by Wood, to survey the Annan tract, and that he surveyed it. That he made inquiry for the Annan papers, the old deeds, but was informed by Wood that he was not in possession of them. That all the draft he had was the draft marked A. That it was suggested by Wood and others, that certain land belonged to the Annan tract, but that he, witness, informed them that there were no courses and distances set forth in the plot to include the land in the survey. However, we ran round in accordance with the adjoining landmarks, and included within our survey all the land suggested as the Annan tract. That he included the vacant land, and mad^ the quantity 475 acres 38 perches. That he was again called <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"32\">*32</page-number>oa by Wood, to run the line or lines between the vacant land and the other, according to the old draft. * * * The contents of what was thought to be <em>vacant land </em>were 25 acres 3 roods and 8 perches. We ran that much out of the survey of the whole we had previously made. He afterwards said the draft was a draft of the 412 acres and allowance, and that draft was enclosed by black lines, with the exception of the part spoken of as vacant\u2014 that was enclosed by dotted lines. The black lines had courses and distances, the dotted lipes had not. Thomas Wood remarked that the whole included in the dotted lines had been considered the Annan tract. The black lines of themselves, formed a plot\u2014 closed. The dotted lines were outside of it. * * * We found no marks on the ground on the dotted line, except the difference in the growth of the timber, &amp;c.</summary>\n<summary data-order=\"52\" data-type=\"summary\" id=\"b32-6\">Hagerty testified, <em>inter alia, </em>\u201cthat Wood contended that he had bought all that tract known as the Annan farm, and that the vacant land had been used as a part of the Annan farm, and he claimed it on that ground. In 1838 or 9, Wood demanded it\u2014 Annan refused to convey it. That Annan thought it had overrun too much, and he did not want to be speculated upon. After the deed from Annan to Jones, Wood told me he had witnessed the deed. He said he was in the squire\u2019s office, and they asked him to witness it, and he did not see how he could get out of doing so, and he didn\u2019t know what effect it would have, whether it would bar him from recovering or not.\u201d</summary>\n<summary data-order=\"53\" data-type=\"summary\" id=\"b32-7\">Defendant\u2019s counsel gave in evidence a mortgage from John Jones to Dr. Samuel Annan, executor of the will of Robert Annan, deceased, dated April 2, 1839, for $7000, on 449 acres 70 perches of land, being the same premises that day conveyed by Dr. Samuel Annan, surviving executor, &amp;c., to John Jones. <em>To this mortgage Thomas Wood, the plaintiff, was a subscribing witness </em>\u2014 the said mortgage being given for a part of the purchase-money mentioned in the article of agreement of August 9, 1838.</summary>\n<summary data-order=\"54\" data-type=\"summary\" id=\"b32-8\">Also, a warrant to Dr. Samuel Annan, dated Nov. 8, 1838, for 40 acres of land, in West Eallowfield, Chester county, and a survey in pursuance thereof, of 33 acres. 116 perches and allowance, being the same warrant recited in the deed from Dr. Samuel Annan to John Jones, dated April 3, 1839.</summary>\n<summary data-order=\"55\" data-type=\"summary\" id=\"b32-9\">Also, the deed from Colonel James Taylor to Robert Annan, dated ' October 22, 1799, for 412 acres and allowance, being the deed recited in the deed from Dr. Samuel Annan, surviving executor, &amp;c., to John Jones, dated April 2, 1839.</summary>\n<summary data-order=\"56\" data-type=\"summary\" id=\"b32-10\">The defendant here closed his case.</summary>\n<summary data-order=\"57\" data-type=\"summary\" id=\"b32-11\">Defendant requested the court to charge the jury as follows :</summary>\n<summary data-order=\"58\" data-type=\"summary\" id=\"b32-12\">1.

It is not disputed but that the plaintiff complied with his covenant so far as relates to the tract of 449 acres 70 perches, but this does not embrace the whole \u201cAnnan farm.\u201d It seems that the Rev. Robert Annan acquired title to about 412 acres with allowance, in the year 1799, by deed from James Taylor. Another deed was also made to him by Taylor, of the same date, for a piece of 28 acres, for which Taylor had a warrant of the 28th of October 1785, which was stated in the deed to have been surveyed, but not returned, and which bounded on the larger tract. This latter tract has ever since been considered a part of the \u201c Annan farm.\u201d It was enclosed, occupied, and farmed by Robert Annan, up to his death, in 1819, and has been treated as such to the time of the sale.</summary>\n<summary data-order=\"63\" data-type=\"summary\" id=\"b33-8\">It is very clear the deed for 449 acres 70 perches did not convey it, and therefore the defendant alleges the plaintiff has no right to recover. Did the case stop here, his allegation would undoubtedly be correct. This brings us to the contract between Annan and Wood. The article of agreement stipulates that Annan was to convey the \u201cAnnan farm\u201d \u2014 the lines to be run by the plot and deeds \u2014 \u201c the farm to be taken in a tract, be the same more or less\u201d \u2014 consideration, $10,000. By this agreement, Wood was entitled to have a deed for the whole \u201cAnnan farm.\u201d Notwithstanding the deeds and plot are referred to, still the general description <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"34\">*34</page-number>will prevail. Besides, the deed for the smaller tract ought not to he excluded from the reference. It appears by the evidence, that on the 3d of April 1839, Dr. Annan executed a deed to Jones for the 25 acre tract \u2014 omitting to name himself as executor. He had procured a warrant for 40 acres, which included the 25 acres, and had the same surveyed. The plaintiff contends this conveyance was an execution of the power conferred upon Annan by his father\u2019s will, and Jones having thus obtained title to the whole \u201cAnnanfarm,\u201d he is liable to the plaintiff for the balance of the consideration, as stated in the article of agreement. To this the defendant replies that the deed of April 2, 1839, from Dr. Annan, executor of his father, to John Jones, closed all questions as to the quantity of the land agreed to be sold by the agreement of August 9, 1838, between Annan and Wood, and also as to the amount of purchase money, and that the deed of April 3, 1839, from Annan to Jones, is not an execution of the power in said will. Two questions are thus presented for solution. Did the deed of April 2, 1839, close all questions as to the quantity of land and amount of purchase-money ? If such was its effect, there can be no recovery in this suit. It is a well-established rule of law, that as between vendor and vendee by the acceptance of a deed or payment of purchase-money, the article is merged, and the parties are precluded from alleging a deficiency of land or claim for a surplus. The execution of a conveyance is the consummation of the article, unless there be fraud or deceit; mutual misapprehension is not enough. The inquiry is merely this: <em>Was Wood deceived or defrauded ? </em>It is contended that he was \u2014 that Dr. Annan had a right, and was bound by the article to convey the \u201cAnnan farm that he suppressed from Wood\u2019s knowledge material facts in relation to the title, and that his object was to secure to himself a private advantage out of his father\u2019s estate. <em>If you are satisfied there was fraud or deception practised by Annan upon Wood, </em>the deed of the 2d of April 1839 is not in the latter\u2019s way. But still, if there was a reasonable ground for doubt as to the title to the 25 acres, and that doubt was honestly entertained, there was nothing improper or fraudulent in excluding this tract from the conveyance. If Wood was not deceived by Annan, he cannot complain. If you shall decide he was not, your verdict must be for the defendant. If you come to a contrary conclusion, then the question arises whether the deed of April 3, 1839, was an execution of the power in the will of Dr. Annan. Has Jones obtained a title to the \u201cAnnan farm,\u201d or in other words, has the article of agreement between him and Wood been complied with by Wood ? Certain rules are laid down inlaw which are to govern in a question such as this.</summary>\n<summary data-order=\"64\" data-type=\"summary\" id=\"b34-6\">1.

It is said by defendant\u2019s counsel, Dr. Annan did not know the tract belonged to his father\u2019s estate. He had sufficient evidence of the fact in his possession, and, under the circumstances, making to Jones the deed he did, he could not gainsay it, nor disturb Jones in his possession. The latter was put in the same position as if the whole 475 acres had been originally conveyed to him by Dr. Annan, as executor of his father\u2019s will.

The judge laid down the law correctly, that the deed closes all questions as to quantity of land and purchase money in the articles, unless there be fraud or deceit; but he left it to the jury to infer fraud or deceit, without any evidence. This was erroneous. It is presumed he meant fraud or deception at the execution of the deed of April 2, 1839. We may search in vain for any evidence of it. The deed was drawn by Whitson, pursuant to a survey made under Wood\u2019s direction; it was executed by Annan to Jones, under the article between Wood and Jones of August 11, 1838, and in the presence of Wood, who signed it as a witness; the $3000 were paid to Annan in Wood\u2019s presence; the mortgage for $7000 was executed by Jones to Annan for the same property, and Wood signed as a witness, and not a word of dissatisfaction is heard. Wood settled with Haggerty for his share of the profits, and all was supposed to be at an end. Jones could have no idea but that all was closed; He then purchased of Annan the 25 acres, and paid him for it. <em>Nine years </em>elapsed, and Wood sued Jones, alleging he was deceived. But was Wood, at any time, deceived by Annan? Annan did not agree to convey the vacant land. He refused to convey it. Wood demanded that he should, and advised with counsel. It was an open question between Annan and Wood, whether Annan could be compelled to convey or not. Wood might have refused to accept the deed of Annan for any part of it, unless the whole w'ere conveyed. But he chose to go on and complete the business upon Annan\u2019s terms, leaving out the vacant land. This he did with his eyes open. The deed of April 2, 1839, the payment of the money, and the mortgage closed all questions upon the articles. The defendant was entitled to an explicit direction to the jury to that effect.</p>\n<p data-order=\"96\" data-type=\"legal\" id=\"b37-7\">The deed closes all questions as to the quantity of land and purchase-money in the articles: Cronister <em>v. </em>Cronister, <em>W. </em>&amp; <em>Ser. </em>443; Smith <em>v. </em>Evans, 6 <em>Bin. </em>102; Baily <em>v. </em>Snyder, 13 <em>Ser. &amp; R. </em>162; Creigh <em>v. </em>Beelin, <em>1 W. &amp; Ser. </em>83; Shurtz <em>v. </em>Thomas, 8 <em>Barr </em>363; 10 <em>Watts </em>427.</p>\n<p data-order=\"97\" data-type=\"legal\" id=\"b37-8\">In this case the deed was accepted without a release of dower.</p>\n<p data-order=\"98\" data-type=\"legal\" id=\"b37-9\">The purchaser took the title, which he consented to take in satisfaction : 8 <em>Barr </em>364.</p>\n<p data-order=\"99\" data-type=\"legal\" id=\"b37-10\">The acceptance of the deed of April 2, 1839, by Jones, from Annan, having been in pursuance of the article of August 11,1838, between Wood and Jones, and in Wood\u2019s presence, he not objecting, it was as if accepted by Wood \u2014 Jones merely standing in his shoes.</p>\n<p data-order=\"100\" data-type=\"legal\" id=\"b37-11\">But even if Annan ought to have conveyed the whole to Jones, and refused, and Wood allowed the business to be so completed, how can Jones be affected by Annan\u2019s conduct so as to make him <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"38\">*38</page-number>liable to Wood ? There is no evidence of fraud in Jones. If Wood has any claim, it should be upon Annan for refusing to convey on the 2d of April 1839. There is not a tittle of evidence of any fraud on Jones\u2019s part at any time, nor on the part of Annan on the 2d of April 1839. Yet the judge says <em>if fraud or deception was practised by Annan on Wood, </em>the deed of the 2d of April 1839 is not in the latter\u2019s way. <em>This was leaving a question to the jury without any evidence whatever, and was error.</em></p>\n<attorneys data-order=\"101\" data-type=\"attorneys\" id=\"b38-5\"><em>Lewis, </em>for defendant in error.</attorneys>\n<p data-order=\"102\" data-type=\"legal\" id=\"A-\">As to the first 'point taken by the plaintiff in error, the evidence of the deceased witnesses related to precisely the same question \u2014 and this would have been shown if the testimony had been exhibited by the paper-book. The paper-book of the former cause shows that the testimony then produced, as now, was to prove what constituted the Annan farm. On the first point the following cases were referred to: Hobart <em>v. </em>M\u2019Coy, 3 <em>Barr </em>419; Cooper <em>v. </em>Smith, 8 Watts 536; Ottinger <em>v. </em>Ottinger, 18 <em>Ser. &amp; R. </em>142.</p>\n<p data-order=\"103\" data-type=\"legal\" id=\"b38-6\">If in a dispute respecting lands, any fact comes directly in issue, the testimony given to that fact is admissible to prove the same point or fact in another action between the same parties or their privies, though the last suit be for other lands: <em>Greenleaf on Evidence, </em>sec. 164; Foster <em>v. </em>Derby, 28 <em>Eng.

As a general rule, by such acceptance the parties to the transaction are absolutely precluded from looking behind the conveyance for subjects of strife, suggested by their pre<page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"39\">*39</page-number>vious negotiations and contracts; for the last step is esteemed as indisputably expressive of their final conclusions. In the present instance, this well-settled doctrine is as applicable to Wood, the vendor to Jones, as to the latter and his immediate grantor, Annan. The evidence is uncontradicted that the former was present and participated in the conveyance, as a discharge of his agreement with Jones to cause a deed to be executed by Annan for the premises before purchased. He was, undoubtedly, acquainted with its description of the tract to be granted, for he had caused the survey to be made by which that description was ascertained. He was, too, present at its execution and delivery, attesting it, as a subscribing witness, without, so far as appears, a word of complaint or remonstrance; though before that, he had unsuccessfully demanded from Annan a conveyance of the whole tract, including what has been called the vacant land. Under these circumstances, he was properly regarded, bn the trial, as an actual party to the instrument, and subject to all the rules incident to that relation.</p>\n<p id=\"b39-5\">This view of his legal position must have precluded his recovery in this action, had not the court permitted him the choice of claiming the benefit of an exception to the rule which otherwise concluded him. The learned president correctly informed the jury that the practice of a fraud or any deceit by a vendor, misleading a purchaser, would absolve the latter from the conclusive effect of the conveyance, and open the door for inquiry under the original agreement. To this instruction no exception can be taken. As an abstract proposition, it is unquestionable. But the court went a step further, by referring to the triers of fact, as a legitimate subject for discussion and decision, whether Wood had been defrauded by the deceitful practices of Annan, or by concealment of material facts in relation to the title which the vendor was bound to disclose, but failed to do so in the hope of securing a private benefit to himself? \u201cIf,\u201d said the judge, \u201cyou are satisfied there was fraud or deception practised by Annan upon Wood, the deed of the 2d of April 1839 is not in the latter\u2019s way.\u201d This certainly was a most material inquiry, were there any proof upon which to found it. But we have looked in vain through the record, for evidence tending to fasten upon Annan the practice of a fraud. A recurrence to every lawyer\u2019s experience of the facility with which a jury is but too apt to yield itself to a reiterated suggestion of falsehood and malpractice, especially where an innocent party has suffered loss, though from his own neglect, strongly illustrates the value of our legal maxim, that fraud is not to be. presumed, but must be proved. Was there any, the slightest, proof of it here ? The insinuated fraud is said to consist in the undue concealment by Annan, of the extent of what was known as the Annan farm, and, by wilful misrepresentation, inducing Wood to accept a less quantity of land than by the terms of his purchase he was entitled <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"40\">*40</page-number>to. To determine whether this was so, we must look to the evidence of Annan\u2019s knowledge on this subject. The first fact which presents itself in this connection is that, at the time of the sale, he was not a resident on the farm, and had not been since boyhood, many years before ; much of the intermediate period having been spent abroad. When first called on by Wood, and before the purchase, he expressly declared the tract contained but 412 acres, and he now swears \u2014 his statement standing wholly uncontradieted\u2014 that he knew of no muniment connected with the title of the estate, save the deed of 1799, from Colonel Taylor to his father, for 412 acres and allowance, and the draft (marked A) by which the land, the subject of that deed, was correctly delineated by black lines, laid down by course and distance, and exhibiting that portion of the tract he had always understood was vacant land, as enclosed by dotted lines, unmarked by course or distance, in such a way as to lead to the conclusion it formed no part of the conveyed land; that he never had possession of 'the second deed made by Taylor, and knew not of its existence; that when Wood first proposed to purchase, he distinctly informed him the extent of the tract he had to sell was included within the black lines of the draft, which was furnished to the buyer as a means of ascertaining the boundaries, at the same time telling him that the piece of land exhibited as enclosed within dotted lines was vacant, and he (Wood) might, if he saw proper, take it up; that he (Annan) disclaimed any title to it, and refused to bind himself to convey any exact number of acres, or to be responsible for the correctness of the apparent lines of the tract, but put upon Wood the duty of ascertaining them, from the <em>data </em>then furnished. This Wood undertook to effect, and accordingly actually caused new surveys to be made by an artist of his own selection ; in the first of which he included the estimated 28 acres as part of the farm, but afterwards caused the greater portion of it to be left out of the second survey, under the conviction that his original impression was erroneous. The deed was prepared in accordance with this second survey; but before its execution Wood, for some reason, seems to have recurred to his first impression, and, therefore, insisted that Annan should convey both parcels of land. The latter refused, because, as he said, he owned the \u2019title of the original tract alone, and finally, after the lapse of months, the deed as prepared was executed and accepted with Wood\u2019s full assent; nay, by his procurement. Before the conveyance, however, Annan, acting upon what he swears was his conviction, procured a warrant for what he supposed was vacant land, and, after causing it to be surveyed, sold and conveyed it, as his own, to Jones, the day next succeeding his grant of the first tract. I have thus given a detail of the leading features of this transaction. They furnish, to our apprehension, no evidence, however inconsiderable, that from the beginning to the end of it, Dr. <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"41\">*41</page-number>Annan knew or suspected his deceased father had been the owner of the so-called vacant land ; or that he practised any art, or used any device to blindfold Wood, or to prevent him from attaining to the truth. As evidence of practised deceit, our attention was called to the language of the original agreement between Annan and Wood, in which it is stipulated that the lines of the tract are to be run \u201c by the <em>deeds </em>and plotto the answer returned by Annan to one of the plaintiff\u2019s cross-interrogatories, in which he is made to say he had <em>a deed </em>for the 28 acres; and to the fact that, after his sale to Wood, he procured a new warrant, under which he set up a title to the land mistaken as vacant. But these portions of the evidence, candidly treated, furnish no ground upon which to erect an hypothesis of actual fraud. As to the answer to the cross-interrogatory, it, beyond question, was made to assume an affirmative instead of a negative shape, by the blunder of the commissioner in using the article \u201ca,\u201d instead of the word \u201cno.\u201d In answer to the very next question, which asserts the existence of such a deed, and inquires of the witness\u2019s knowledge regarding it, he flatly denies all cognizance of it, and reiterates that he never had such a deed. Besides, the admission of such a document is in direct contradiction of all he had said before and says after. As to the fact of a new warrant, it is sufficient to observe that so far from evidencing knowledge of a previous warrant and survey constituting the title conveyed to his father, it indicates a belief that no such title had existence; or, at the very least, it proves nothing relating to the disputed point. We are thus reduced to the forced inference of knowledge, to be deduced from the use of the plural \u201c deeds,\u201d in the article of agreement. But, surely, no sane man, looking with unprejudiced eyes, can conjure from this word the monster fraud charged upon the seller. If the jurors did found themselves upon ground so utterly insufficient to sustain a structure so weighty, it but proves the accuracy of the remark I made in the outset. Looking at the whole of the proofs dispassionately, we have failed to discover any thing which can properly give birth to even a suspicion of deceit and falsehood practised by Annan; and we are almost forced upon the conclusion that the verdict pronounced is to be ascribed to the simple fact that Annan received money which ought to have gone into Wood\u2019s purse. But, though it may be conceded that such a consideration would naturally operate with men unversed in, and therefore unimpressed by the force of merely professional reasoning, it affords no apology we can recognise as sufficient for the conclusion arrived at.</p>\n<p id=\"b41-6\">I have, hitherto, considered this contest as though it were an action between Wood and Annan. But, still more unfavourably for the plaintiff, it is an effort to compel Jones to pay a second time for a portion of his land. To compass this, proof of the grossest fraud, practised by Annan on Wood, would be inefficar <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"42\">*42</page-number>cious. It would be necessary to go farther, by showing Jones\u2019s participation in, or, at least, knowledge of the imputed iniquity. This necessity seems to have been overlooked at the trial. The attention of the jury was confined to the averred malpractices of Annan. When the argument was first broached in this court, the existence of proof involving Jones was not hinted. Indeed, such a suggestion must, necessarily, fail of success. From the beginning, Wood seems to have been the active agent in perfecting the arrangements ending in the conveyance. Jones, for aught that appears, was the passive recipient of the title Wood and Annan caused to be prepared for him. It is not intimated he knew of or had reason to suspect the existence of Taylor\u2019s second conveyance, or that there was any thing to lead him to doubt the truth of An-nan\u2019s assertions, except the demand made by Wood, afterwards at least tacitly abandoned. And had there been, mere doubt is insufficient' to entail upon him a consequence which can flow only from actual fraud. He appears to have relied, as he had a right to do, upon Wood\u2019s undertaking to procure for him a sufficient conveyance of the \u201cAnnan farm.\u201d Wood recognised this as the obligation he had assumed, and was, therefore, active in settling the terms of that conveyance. Jones received it at his hands, and afterwards took from Annan a transfer of the remaining land. In all this, we cannot perceive the slightest shadow of blame, legal or moral, attaching upon the defendant. So clear is this, that, I repeat, no accusation of impropriety in him seems to have been indulged below, nor was it here, until a suggestion of its necessity drove the ingenious counsel, who argued for the defendant in error, upon an endeavour to point to proof of it. In this, however, he wholly failed.</p>\n<p id=\"b42-6\">It follows from what I have said, there is in that part of the charge under review, faults of commission and omission. Of commission, in putting the jury at liberty to find an asserted fact, without proof of it. Of omission, in, inadvertently, neglecting to point out to them that fraud practised or participated by Jones, is indispensable to the plaintiff\u2019s success in this action. For these errors the judgment must be reversed, and the cause remitted for another trial.</p>\n<p id=\"b42-7\">But the other objection to the charge is untenable. Under the authority of Allison <em>v. </em>Kurtz, 2 <em>Watts </em>185, and the doctrine there recognised, repeated in Miller <em>v. </em>Meetch, 8 <em>Bin. </em>418, the deed of April 3, 1839, from Annan to Jones, may be accepted as a competent execution of the power to sell, conferred by the will of the Rev. Mr. Annan. The distinction settled by the decisions seems to be this: When the donee of a power to sell land possesses, also, an interest in the subject of the power, a conveyance by him, without actual reference to the power, will not be deemed an execution of it, except there be evidence of an intention to execute it, or, at <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"43\">*43</page-number>least, in the face of evidence, disproving such an intention; hut where the donee has no estate in the premises, and his conveyance can only be made operative by treating it as an exertion of the power to sell, it will be so considered. It is upon this ground the authorities are to be reconciled, and, among them, our own cases of Allison <em>v. </em>Kurtz, and Hay <em>v. </em>Mayer, 8 <em>Watts </em>208, particularly referred to on the argument. The principle stated embraces the conveyance in question, and justifies the opinion expressed by the court upon this point. Were it, however, erroneous, it would inflict no injury on the defendant, since, doubtless, the grantor, and those claiming the benefit of the sale, would not be permitted to question the validity of that conveyance, as a means of transferring the title of the testator. This remark is, of course, based upon the supposed acquiescence of the parties interested under the will, by participating in the avails of the sale.</p>\n<p id=\"b43-5\">The exception to the evidence received is unfounded. The former statements of the deceased witnesses were made on the trial of an action between the same parties, and bear directly upon the same subject of dispute, namely, the boundaries and extent of the tract known as the \u201c Annan farm.\u201d This was a point of inquiry in both instances, material to the issue involved, and, therefore, opening to the parties plenary opportunity of interrogating the witnesses, in chief and by cross-examination. The question of the competency of the evidence consequently falls directly within the rule settled by our own cases, cited on the argument, and stated by Mr. Greenleaf, with his accustomed accuracy, in his work on evidence.
