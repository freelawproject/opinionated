The rule in Shelly\u2019s case is a settled rule of property in Pennsylvania; and in deciding whether a devise is within the rule, no influence is to be conceded to any supposed prohibition of the rule by the testator, or to the defeat of a particular intention. The leading inquiry is what is the great object of the devisor; but where the form of the disposition is constituted of terms of art, to which an ascertained meaning has been fixed by decision, the construction settled is binding on courts.</headnotes>\n<headnotes data-order=\"2\" data-type=\"headnotes\" id=\"b95-5\">2.

The effect and bearing of this deed is explained in the charge of the court delivered by Chapman, President Judge, as follows:</summary>\n<summary data-order=\"33\" data-type=\"summary\" id=\"b97-12\">The plaintiffs, in the first case, claim about thirty-six acres of land, now in the possession of Sarah George, and in the latter, they claim two acres, two roods, and twenty-two perches, now in the possession of Sarah Worrall.

In construing this devise, effect is to he given to every word employed by the testator to manifest his intent, and no word or phrase is to be rejected to which effect can be legally given. In cases of wills, the governing rule of construction is the intent of the testator, which the court is to find out by his words, and to construe conformably thereto, as far as possible, consistent with the rules of lawLord Hardwicke, in Browswood <em>v. </em>Edwards\u2019, 2 <em>Ves. Sr. </em>247; Frogmorton <em>v. </em>Bramstone, 3 <em>Bur. </em>1622. \u201cWithin a century past a more liberal construction of the words of a testator has prevailed Goodright <em>v. </em>White, 3 <em>Bl. Rep. </em>1010. It is the cardinal rule in the construction of wills that the intention of testator to be collected from the whole instrument \u2014 or as is sometimes expressed, from the four corners \u2014 is to govern: per Justice Rouers, in Johnson <em>v. </em>Morton, 10 <em>Barr </em>247; <em>id. </em>500, per Coulter, J.</p>\n<p data-order=\"53\" data-type=\"legal\" id=\"b100-7\">The construction given to this devise below, requires that the words \u201cfor and during his natural life, and after his decease,\u201d as also the words \u201c and to their heirs for ever,\u201d shall be expunged or disregarded as expressions indicative of the testator\u2019s intent. This liberty is taken with the will, on the ground that some <em>general intent </em>may be thus answered, to which any <em>particular intent </em>is to give way. But in this devise there is no conflict between a particular intent and a general intent. Mordecai the first, can take for life, remainder to his issue or children living at his death, in fee. This violates no rule of legal policy. Besides, these phrases are vague at best, and might well be exploded.</p>\n<p data-order=\"54\" data-type=\"legal\" id=\"b100-8\"><em>Powell, </em>remarking on the ease of Wright <em>v. </em>Leigh : \u2014 \u201c The case cannot be considered as having any weight in producing a revival of the absurd, and, we have seen, discarded doctrine of general and particular intention, of which the writer will only further observe, that since it has long ceased to exist \u2014 if it ever <em>existed </em>\u2014 in <em>fact, </em>it were much to be wished that it were completely exploded in name.\u201d And calls it a doctrine vague and indefinite, \u201c and fraught with absurdity and mischief 2 <em>Powell on Devises </em>559.</p>\n<p data-order=\"55\" data-type=\"legal\" id=\"b100-9\">The intention in this case, independent of any artificial rules of construction, is manifest.</p>\n<p data-order=\"56\" data-type=\"legal\" id=\"b100-10\">At the time the will was made, Mordecai the first had a son, to whom the terms issue and heirs of his body might apply. He, Mordecai the first, was, a young man, aged thirty-one at the date of the will, and might have other children; and if he should have, it was not intended to exclude them. They were the persons designated to take the remainder, and the words, \u201c their heirs for ever,\u201d express the quantity of estate intended to be given, to wit, a fee simple: Groodright <em>v. </em>White, <em>Bl. Rep. </em>1010.</p>\n<p data-order=\"57\" data-type=\"legal\" id=\"b101-4\"><page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"101\">*101</page-number>Our second point, therefore, is, \u2014 The words, <em>\u201c heirs of the body\u201d </em>and \u201c <em>such issue,\u201d </em>as used by the testator, are to be understood as meaning <em>children or issue </em>living at the time of his decease. This construction gives effect to all the words of the devise: Archer\u2019s case, 1 <em>Coke\u2019s Rep. </em>66; <em>Skin. </em>430; Clerk <em>v. </em>Day, <em>Sir F. Moore </em>593; 2 <em>Bl. Rep. </em>1010; Long <em>v. </em>Beaumont, 1 P. <em>W. </em>229. See also Henry <em>v. </em>Purcell, 2 <em>Bl. Rep. </em>1002; Bagshaw v. Spencer, 1 <em>Ves. Sen. </em>142; same case, 2 <em>Atk. </em>570; 3 <em>East </em>103; Table 2, 7 <em>Law. </em>Lib.; 2 <em>Burr </em>1109; 7 <em>Taunton </em>362; 5 <em>B. &amp; C. </em>866; 12 <em>Eng. C. L. </em>392.</p>\n<p data-order=\"58\" data-type=\"legal\" id=\"b101-5\">These are all English cases. It is not doubted that in England at the present day the devise now before the court would not be decided to give to Mordecai Morgan the first an estate-tail under the rule in Shelly\u2019s case; but, on the contrary, the plain intention of the testator would be allowed to prevail.</p>\n<p data-order=\"59\" data-type=\"legal\" id=\"b101-6\">If among the decisions in the English hooks, some exist which cannot be reconciled, it may be lamented; but we are not to suffer for this. Pennsylvania has her own law on this subject, perfectly adapted to her own peculiar situation, settled by a long series of solemn adjudications; all of which are not now to be changed by the reappearance of the rule in Shelly\u2019s case. Long prior to the date of the will of John Morgan, (1744,) primogenitureship (if it ever had existed within her limits) had been renounced as inconsistent with both the feelings and prosperity of the people. This vital and wide difference between the descent of real estate in the two countries could not fail to have its effect upon the-application of the rule in Shelly\u2019s case.</p>\n<p data-order=\"60\" data-type=\"legal\" id=\"b101-7\">The \u201c superadded words,\u201d as they are called, are admitted by every text writer (except, perhaps, Hargrave) to take a case out of the application of that rule, wherever \u201c they break the line of descent.\u201d Why so ? Because in such ease they show the intention of the testator. In England, in nineteen instances out of twenty, the descent of the fee simple and the estate-tail are the same. In Pennsylvania, in nineteen instances out of twenty they vary. It follows, then, that the intention shown by the use of the superadded words is twenty times as strong in Pennsylvania as it would he in England. These superadded words exist in our ease, although they were thrown out of it by the judge below without any reason assigned.</p>\n<p data-order=\"61\" data-type=\"legal\" id=\"b101-8\">In <em>Pennsylvania, </em>where the word <em>heirs </em>is used, it is not applicable only to the heir at common law, but refers to our system of descent: 4 <em>Pa. L. J. </em>193; 2 <em>Yeates </em>54; 2 <em>Bin. </em>20; 10 <em>Watts 190; </em>3 <em>Barr </em>158.</p>\n<p data-order=\"62\" data-type=\"legal\" id=\"b101-9\">The leading case in Pennsylvania is that of Findley <em>v. </em>Riddle, 3 <em>Bin. </em>139. This case was carefully argued three times. First, before Chief Justice Tilshman, at a circuit court for Franklin <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"102\">*102</page-number>county, in June 1807, when he intimated an opinion that John took .only an estate for life, but reserved the point.</p>\n<p data-order=\"63\" data-type=\"legal\" id=\"b102-6\">2d. It was argued before him on a motion for a new trial, when he said, \u201cNothing can be more clear than that the testator meant to give his son John an estate for life only.\u201d</p>\n<p data-order=\"64\" data-type=\"legal\" id=\"b102-7\">The case then came, by appeal, before the court in banc. In the opinions of the court, it is believed that almost every case upon the subject decided in either England or Pennsylvania up to that time was collected and investigated. See also Dunwoody <em>v. </em>Read, 3 <em>Ser. &amp; R. </em>435, where the same doctrine is held, so far as regards the estate-tail; Abbot <em>v. </em>Jenkins, 10 <em>Ser. &amp; R. </em>296.</p>\n<p data-order=\"65\" data-type=\"legal\" id=\"b102-8\">In the case before us, there is the express estate for life to Mordecai Morgan the first, and the remainder is limited to all his issue, not successively, but to take all at the same time equally, and in fee simple. The time when they are so to take, is the death of Mordecai Morgan the first: 5 <em>Rawle </em>231.</p>\n<p data-order=\"66\" data-type=\"legal\" id=\"b102-9\">These cases are sufficient to establish the doctrine that at least in Pennsylvania the <em>plain intention </em>of the testator is at this day too strong for what was the rule in Shelly\u2019s case;' Intention is paramount to all technical words: Miller <em>v. </em>Lynn, 7 <em>Barr </em>443; Thompson <em>v. </em>Currin, 10 <em>Barr </em>498.</p>\n<p data-order=\"67\" data-type=\"legal\" id=\"b102-10\">If the rule in Shelly\u2019s case must be applied to this devise, the proper application of it will give to Mordecai Morgan the first <em>a fee simple, </em>and not an estate-tail.</p>\n<p data-order=\"68\" data-type=\"legal\" id=\"b102-11\">3d. The bill of exceptions to the admission in evidence of the instrument dated 28th January 1848, and the proceedings to bar the estate-tail, may be considered in connection with the charge of the court that such instrument was sufficient to enable the plaintiff to recover. The court admitted that such instrument had no effect to bar the estate-tail. Then it was a mere nullity. The object for which alone it was made utterly failed. It had no legal existence until recorded within six months in the recorder\u2019s office of the proper county. It never has been so entered. If any estate-tail existed, it still remains in Joshua Morgan, the eldest son of James Morgan. The instrument was intended to convey, and did convey, an estate-tail or nothing. This is apparent on its face. There is no consideration for it,, if it did not pass an estate in tail.</p>\n<p data-order=\"69\" data-type=\"legal\" id=\"b102-12\">The deed of 16th June 1807, from James Morgan to Joseph Morgan and others, was a partition which these plaintiffs cannot dispute. No one but the owner of the estate-tail can do so or recover these premises.</p>\n<attorneys data-order=\"70\" data-type=\"attorneys\" id=\"b102-13\"><em>JE. </em>and <em>W.

The grandfather, the testator, supposed that he was providing for all his children. The will was made 100 yea^s ago. It was long acquiesced in. Our proposition is that the testator used the words \u201c <em>heirs of his hody </em>lawfully begotten,\u201d not in their strict legal sense, but as synonymous with <em>children. </em>The words, if construed as an estate-tail, would conflict with the estate <em>in fee </em>granted in the next clause. The rule is that where the <em>super added words, </em>(that is, the words used after the terms \u201cheirs of the body,\u201d) import distribution, the words \u201cheirs of the body\u201d are not to be construed strictly as meaning an estate-tail; and he contended that in this case the superadded words import distribution: Crosby <em>v. </em>Davis, 4 <em>Pa. L. J. </em>As to the case of Heilman <em>v. </em>Bouslaugh, 1 <em>Harris, </em>it was on a <em>deed; </em>and in a deed the term heirs of the body are terms of art, and the court did not go into other parts of the deed to ascertain <em>the actual intention. </em>But in a will the case is different, the actual intention is to be considered. It is not, however, admitted that the term \u201cheirs of the body\u201d means, in Pennsylvania, an estate-tail \u2014 but that the term \u201c heirs\u201d imply distribution. He referred to another part of the will to show in what sense the testator used the terms \u201cheirs of the body.\u201d In this case the limitation over is <em>in fee, </em>and is to be considered as showing that the testator was not wedded to an estate-tail.</p>\n<opinion data-order=\"82\" data-type=\"opinion\" id=\"x999-1\" type=\"majority\">\n<p id=\"b104-8\">The opinion of the court was delivered April 21, by</p>\n<author id=\"b104-9\">Bell, J.</author>\n<p id=\"AC\">The rule in Shelly\u2019s case has been so repeatedly recognised as a feature of our law, that further discussion is precluded. In the recent case, Heilman <em>v. </em>Bouslaugh, 1 <em>Harris </em>344, if not satisfactorily vindicated, it is, at least, shown to be a settled rule of property in Pennsylvania, not to be put aside but at the risk of unsettling titles, and the introduction of confusion and uncertainty. Indeed, our numerous concurring decisions on this point, if any effect is to be accorded to them, must terminate, in our courts, further speculation as to the original propriety of the rule, and confine us to the inquiry whether the terms used to express the disposition of an estate fall within its operation. In <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"105\">*105</page-number>settling this question, when it springs from a last will, no influence is to be conceded to any supposed prohibition of the rule by the testator, or to the defeat of a particular intention by its interposition. Whether it shall be effective as a governing principle is not subject to his discretion where the form of testamentary direction invites it to action, and the frequent frustration of a partial design is one of its acknowledged consequences. In its application, the effort is to give effect to the leading intent, though at the sacrifice of a minor purpose, and, therefore, in this, as in other cases, .the first inquiry is, what is the great object'of the devisor. The ascertainment of this is, doubtless, subject to the ordinary rules of construction; but where well-considered and unimpeached adjudications have assigned to certain forms of disposition a determinate result, we are bound by it as an ascertained law of construction. In saying this, I am not unmindful of the oft-repeated remark that, as every testament is apt to present some feature peculiar to itself, the interpretation of one can render but little aid in assisting to the proper meaning of another. This is true; but it is equally so that where a particular manner of devise has become the subject of frequent adjudication, certainly without which there is no safety, public or private, it is requisite that the rule so settled shall be followed in all similar cases. This is peculiarly so, where the form of the disposition is constituted of terms of art, to which an ascertained meaning is commonly affixed.</p>\n<p id=\"b105-6\">The devise before us stands, I think, in this category. To say nothing of numerous. English cases, it is impossible to distinguish it, in principle, from our own deliberate determinations in Carter <em>v. </em>McMichael, 10 <em>Ser. &amp; R. </em>429; Paxson <em>v. </em>Lefferts, 3 <em>Rawle </em>59, and the prior decisions on which they are based. It is true, that, in the first of these, the limitation was to the <em>heirs male </em>of the body of the first taker, and the heirs and assigns of such heirs male; from whence Chief Justice Tilghman deduced an argument favoring the application of the rule in Shelly\u2019s ease. But the conclusion was not made to rest solely on this. A very important part of the argument was drawn from the fact, that unless an estate of inheritance was given to the first taker, the remainder limited over in fee simple must be defeated. And the latter condition was the governing reason in Paxson <em>v. </em>Lefferts, with a reference to the precedent case. That devise was almost, if not altogether, identical with the present. The land was given to the testator\u2019s son Charles, during his natural life, and if he should leave lawful issue, then to them, their heirs- and assigns for ever; but for want of such lawful issue, over in fee. It will be observed, the only difference is in the employment of the words \u201clawful issue,\u201d instead of \u201cheirs of the body,\u201d used in the first part of our disposing clause. But if there be a distinction, this difference is in favor of the construction claimed by the plaintiffs below, since <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"106\">*106</page-number>\u201cheirs of the body\u201d are, strictly, words of limitation, while the other terms operate, in a.deed, as words of purchase, though they may he taken either way in a will. In our case, we may, consequently, accept, without further argument, what cost Mr. Justice Kennedy some reasoning to prove in Paxson <em>v. </em>Lefferts, namely, that the terms employed imported limitation, and not purchase. On the argument before us, some stress was laid upon the substitution of \u201csuch issue\u201d for \u201cheirs of his body,\u201d as showing they were employed as expressive of the same meaning; and it was argued that as \u201cissue of the body\u201d are sometimes treated as terms of purchase, the court ought to lean towards that construction here. To this, a reference to the last case might be regarded a sufficient answer; hut it may he added that, as a general rule,-the words relied on, used in a will in reference to an estate in land, operate as a further limitation, unless there be something in the context to show the testator contemplated a failure of issue at a particular period, and not an indefinite failure. The question was made in Geering <em>v. </em>Shenton, 1 <em>Cowp. </em>410, a case, in most of its features, very like the present. It was a devise to J. S. and the heirs of his body, lawfully begotten, and their heirs for ever; but in case the said J. S. should die without leaving <em>issue of his </em>body, then over in fee. It was held that the devisee took in tail, the words \u201cshall die without issue of his body\u201d qualifying the preceding general words. As adverse to this construction, it was urged that, by the superadded words of limitation, the testator evinced an intention to give to the issue of the first taker a fee as purchasers. But Lord Mansfield inquired of the counsel whether he knew of any case where, upon a limitation of lands upon a dying without issue, those words had been confined to a dying without issue living at the time of his death. The distinction, he added, is between a devise of lands and of personal estate: in the latter case, the words are taken in their vulgar sense; that is, a dying without issue living at the time of the death of the first taker; but in the former, standing unexplained, they mean an indefinite failure of issue. Goodright <em>v. </em>Pullen, 2 <em>Ld. Raym. </em>1437, may also be mentioned in this- connection. There the devise was to N. for life, and, after his decease, to the heirs male of the body of the said N., lawfully to be begotten, and his heirs for ever; but if the said N. shall, happen to die without such heir male, then over. It was argued that the use of the word \u201chis,\u201d in the singular, brought the devise within Archer\u2019s case, and, consequently, the first taker took but an estate for life. But the court answered that, \u201cheirs male of the body\u201d imported an estate-tail, and this was not to be overruled by doubtful expressions; that ever since King <em>v. </em>Melling, 3 <em>Keb. </em>100, it was so settled as not to be disputed, that the word \u201cheirs\u201d is, properly, a word of limitation, and not <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"107\">*107</page-number>of purchase, and so, in a will, is \u201cissue\u201d unexplained, though it is different in a deed.</p>\n<p id=\"b107-6\">Indeed, it may be safely asserted that the words \u201cif he shall leave issue,\u201d or \u201cin default of issue,\u201d and the like, are uniformly construed to mean an indefinite failure of issue, unless there be something in the context to qualify the general expression, or the reference be expressly to persons then existing. As early as Wilde\u2019s case, this doctrine was averred, and it is said that whenever the term \u201cissue\u201d is used in reference to persons not in <em>esse, </em>it is synonymous with the terms \u201cheirs' of the body.\u201d Nor is it enough, to avoid this consequence, that the person named as the source of inheritable blood had issue at the date of the devise, unless it appear such living issue was, particularly, in contemplation of the testator at the moment, as the commencement of an inheritable stock. Of this, Goodright <em>v. </em>White, 2 <em>Bl. Rep. </em>100; Long v. Beaumont, <em>1 P. Wms. </em>229, and Bagshaw <em>v. </em>Spencer, 1 <em>Ves. Sen\u2019r </em>142, are usually cited as examples. They were devises to the heirs of the body or issue of persons known to the testator to be in full life, having children, and the questions were whether there was a sufficient designation of the persons to take ? From the very nature of the case, it was held the parties thus pointed to might take <em>designatione personae, </em>and as though they had been specifically named. It is scarcely necessary to add, this doctrine has no application in the instance before us, though the first Mordecai had a son living at the time of the devise. Had that son died, it cannot admit of doubt any subsequently born issue would have taken under this devise, as heir of the body and competent to carry on the succession by inheritable blood.</p>\n<p id=\"b107-7\">To the cases already noticed, I will only add Morris <em>v. </em>Le Gay, cited by Lord Kenyon in Denn <em>v. </em>Puckey, 5 <em>D. &amp; E. </em>324, and with approbation, in our own cases of Carter <em>v. </em>McMichael, and Paxson <em>v. </em>Lefferts. I introduce it, because it appears to me to be exactly alike, and decisive of the present. The devise was to A. for life, remainder to the heirs of the body of A. <em>and their heirs, </em>and if A. died <em>without issue of her body, </em>over. It was decided that A. took an estate-tail.</p>\n<p id=\"b107-8\">The adjudications I have referred to, and those upon which they are based, furnish an answer to the objection most prominently urged for the defendants below, that the superadded words, serving to limit a fee in the issue of the first taker, show the testator intended to constitute them the stock of a new descent as purchasers, and they are, therefore, not to be treated as branches of their own progenitors. It has long been settled that superadded words of limitation engrafted on words of procreation will not operate to turn these into words of purchase, unless the super-added word denote a different species of heirs from that described by the first words, thus showing an intent to break the ordinary <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"108\">*108</page-number>line of descent from the first taker: <em>Har. Law Tr., </em>504; 1 <em>Ferne Rem. </em>181. Following Ferne, Mr. Justice Kennedy lays it down, in Paxson <em>v. </em>Lefferts, 3 Rawle 59, that if the words he \u201cheirs,\u201d or \u201cheirs of the body,\u201d or \u201cissue of the body,\u201d words of inheritance engrafted on them, if not inconsistent with the nature of the descent pointed out by the first words, will not convert them into words of purchase.</p>\n<p id=\"b108-6\">But it is urged upon us that as, in England, an intention to change the line of descent is sufficiently manifested wherever the superadded words import eventual distribution of the estate among several, as.if it be limited over as a tenancy in common, or to be divided equally among all the heirs of the first taker, \u2014 in Pennsylvania, since the abolition of the right of primogeniture, such a devise as we have here, must be taken as changing the descent; the superadded words, \u201cand to their heirs for ever,\u201d necessarily importing, not the heir in tail, who is generally the right heir in England, but all the lineal descendants of the <em>prcepositus, </em>who take as parceners with us, under the general title of heir. I confess, I was much struck with the view when it was first presented, and very much inclined to adopt it as consistent with reason. But further reflection has satisfied us it is inadmissible. In the first place, it frequently happens that, even in England, the right heirs of a deviser may be of persons entirely different from him who would alone take as heir in tail, and yet it has always been there held as essential, that to withdraw the devise from the power of the rule, distribution must be expressly contemplated, and shown to be so by some precise direction. Secondly, though in Findlay <em>v. </em>Riddle, 3 <em>Bin. </em>139, Mr. Justice Yeates seemed much inclined to adopt the idea that, with us, a limitation to heirs general always imports distribution, and is therefore repugnant to the rule in Shelly\u2019s case, it was not received in our subsequent cases, though expressly urged upon the attention of the court, where full scope was afforded for its operation, had it been thought tenable. In the last case of Heilman <em>v. </em>Bouslaugh, the reasoning of the chief justice is in direct repudiation of it. All this is conclusive that, in this State, a testator is to be regarded as speaking in reference to the common-law system of descent.</p>\n<p id=\"b108-7\">The exception taken to the admission in evidence of the deed from Joshua Morgan to the plaintiff below was but little urged. Though inoperative to bar the entail, it is, questionless, good to convey the grantor\u2019s right of possession. A tenant in tail may convey his life estate, and surely an attempt to convey a larger interest, which fails from a merely technical objection, may carry such an estate as would pass without the omitted ceremony. As his beneficial right of present enjoyment may be sold under an execution, without affecting the future tenant in tail, Armstrong <em>v. </em>Dunager, 16 <em>Ser. &amp; R. </em>323; Elliot <em>v. </em>Pearsoll, 8 <em>W. &amp; Ser. </em>38, <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"109\">*109</page-number>it will certainly pass by private grant; and this may exist under semblance of a grant of his whole estate, just as an agreement to convey a larger estate than the party has, is good for such estate as he may hold; Rohr <em>v. </em>Kindt, 3 <em>W. &amp; Ser. </em>567. The conveyance works, in fact, two distinct effects; one at common law, to pass the present interest; the other under the statute, to bar the entail, a defect in which can only be. objected by a tenant in tail.</p>\n<p id=\"b109-6\">Judgment affirmed.</p>\n<judges id=\"b109-7\">Coulter, J., dissented.</judges>\n</opinion>\n</casebody>\n",
