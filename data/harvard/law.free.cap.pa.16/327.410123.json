The opinion of Lewis, J., was as follows:\u2014 The plaintiff claims under the will of Joel Willis, who was the son of William Willis, deceased. The defendants 'claim as heirs of Samuel Willis, who was also a son of William Willis, deceased. William Willis, the common ancestor, in his will, made in 1800, devised the land in controversy \u201c to my son Samuel Willis, <em>and to his heirs and assigns,\u201d </em>\u201cto have and to hold,\u201d \u201cto him my said son Samuel, and <em>to his heirs and assigns for ever, </em>he or they paying thereout and therefor\u201d'Certain legacies specified in the will. The testator then proceeds to make other dispositions respecting his estate, and in a subsequent part of the will there is this provision: \u201c And in case my son Samuel should die before he marries, then all that part of the estate which I have devised to him in that case I give and devise to my son Joel Willis, his heirs and assigns, to have and to hold to' him my said son Joel, his heirs and assigns for' ever, <em>in as full and ample a manner as my son Samuel held or was to have held the same, and subject to the same conditions and payments\u201d </em>\u2014 with a further charge of \u00bf6460 for the daughters.</summary>\n<summary data-order=\"29\" data-type=\"summary\" id=\"b332-6\">The authorities seem to concur in establishing the rule of construction, that where the gift is plainly and clearly a fee simple, to take effect immediately in possession, a devise over in case of the death of the first-named object of the testator\u2019s bounty is to be treated or intended to provide for his death in the lifetime of the testator. This rule is <em>professedly </em>founded upon the necessity of giving such a construction to a will as. shall preserve it from repugnancy, and shall allow each clause a full operation. But it may be aided by the public policy, which is averse to the continuance of lands in a condition incapable of transmission by alienation for long periods of time. The rule does not seem to be confined to cases where death alone is mentioned without any qualification, but has been applied to cases where the estate is directed to go over if either of the first named devisees \u201c should happen to die <em>without child or children lawfully begotten,\" 5 B. Aid. </em>636, or \u201cshould die <em>leaving child or children,\" </em>13 <em>Hast </em>359, or \u201cshould die <em>without issue born alive,\u201d </em>1 <em>Harris </em>152. It would seem also from the cases, and from the observation of Mr. Justice Bell, in the case last cited, that this rule is applicable whether the <em>corpus </em>of the gift be personalty or realty, where the whole <em>interest in each is given, </em>subject to be defeated by the implied contingency, although most of the cases present bequests of movable property: Caldwell <em>v. </em>Skilton, <em>id.' </em>126. The qualifications which relate to <em>marriage </em>or the <em>birth of children </em>are insufficient to take the case out of the rule. To have this effect, some qualification must be introduced which refers to the <em>time of the death, </em>and not to the <em>circumstances </em>of the <em>devisee </em>upon its occurrence.</summary>\n<summary data-order=\"30\" data-type=\"summary\" id=\"b332-7\">In the case before us, it does not seem to be material whether the testator contemplated the death of Samuel before the <em>accept</em><page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"333\">*333</page-number><em>anee of the devise </em>and <em>becoming personally bound </em>for thec legacies to be paid \u201cthereforor before final distribution of the estate, or before the death of the testator.. We incline to think that the testator referred to the period when his will was to take effect, and that Samuel, not having died unmarried before the testator, took a fee simple subject to no other conditions than the payment of the legacies charged. The devise to Joel, we think, was only intended as a substitution in case of the death of Samuel unmarried <em>before the death of the testator. </em>Joel was only to take \u201cin <em>as full and ample </em>a manner as Samuel held or was to have held, and <em>subject to the same conditions </em>and <em>payments.\u201d </em>The condition of <em>dying before he marries </em>could not be annexed to the gift to Joel, who was already married, and yet he was to hold <em>as Samuel held, </em>and <em>subject </em>to <em>the same conditions and payments. </em>From this, and all the other provisions of the will, we are of opinion that the defendants are entitled to judgment on the case stated.</summary>\n<summary data-order=\"31\" data-type=\"summary\" id=\"b333-6\">Judgment for defendants.</summary>\n<summary data-order=\"32\" data-type=\"summary\" id=\"b333-7\">It was assigned for error:</summary>\n<summary data-order=\"33\" data-type=\"summary\" id=\"b333-8\">The judgment should have been for the plaintiff, subject, if the court considered it necessary to make such order, to the payment of the legacies charged on the premises to the estate of Samuel Willis; and of \u00bf\u00a3460 to the daughters of William Willis, or their representatives; and \u00bf\u00a3136 19s. <em>9d. </em>to the estate of the said William Willis.</summary>\n<attorneys data-order=\"34\" data-type=\"attorneys\" id=\"b333-9\"><em>Chapin, </em>for plaintiff in error and plaintiff below.</attorneys>\n<p data-order=\"35\" data-type=\"legal\" id=\"ACH\">The plaintiff claims that by the will of William Willis, deceased, Samuel Willis took the fee simple of the premises <em>defeasible </em>on his death before marriage, and on the happening of this contingency, the fee simple passed by <em>executory devise </em>to Joel Willis, the plaintiff\u2019s testator.</p>\n<p data-order=\"36\" data-type=\"legal\" id=\"b333-10\">That a fee simple may by <em>executory devise </em>be limited after a fee simple either <em>vested </em>or <em>contingent, </em>is as well established as any principle recognised in law: <em>Fearne on Rem. </em>395-6-7, and cases there cited; 4 <em>Wils. Bac. Abr. </em>297; 4 <em>Kent. Com. </em>269\u201470; 2 <em>Bin. </em>532, Hauer\u2019s Lessee <em>v. </em>Sheetz.</p>\n<p data-order=\"37\" data-type=\"legal\" id=\"b333-11\">The defendants in the court below contended, and the court (Judge Lewis) decided, that Samuel took at once on the testator\u2019s death <em>an indefeasible estate in fee simple </em>\u2014 in other words, that Joel was a mere substitute, to take only in case the devise to Samuel should lapse <em>by his death in the testator\u2019s lifetime.</em></p>\n<p data-order=\"38\" data-type=\"legal\" id=\"b333-12\">To sustain this position, it was claimed as a rule of construction, that a devise over in the event of death, where the first devisee is to take immediately, is construed to mean death <em>in the lifetime of the testator.</em></p>\n<p data-order=\"39\" data-type=\"legal\" id=\"b333-13\">The cases cited in support of this position were, with three exceptions, cases in which the death was connected with no other <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"334\">*334</page-number>circumstance and with-no context indicating a longer time. The words used were merely \u201c in case of her death\u201d \u2014 \u201c if either should die\u201d \u2014 \u201cin the event of her death\u201d \u2014 \u201cin case of her demise\u201d \u2014 \u201cin case of death happening to her\u201d \u2014 \u201cin case of her decease,\u201d &amp;c.</p>\n<p data-order=\"40\" data-type=\"legal\" id=\"b334-6\">Most of these cases were also of bequests of personal property, with respect to which courts have been more reluctant to sustain executory devises. And, even in these cases, the decisions are conflicting. In Cambridge <em>v. </em>Rous, 8 <em>Vesey </em>12, Sir William Grant says, \u201cWords precisely the same were differently construed in Lord Douglass <em>v. </em>Chalmer,\u201d 2 <em>Vesey Jr. </em>501; and Hinckly <em>v. </em>Simmons, 4 <em>Vesey </em>160. In the former, the words were \u201c in case of her decease\u201d and the executory legatee took, \u2014 in the latter, the words were \u201cin case of her death,\u201d and the first taker held. The cases on both sides are exhibited in note A to Billings <em>v. </em>Sandom, 1 <em>B. C. C. </em>394, to all which reference is now made. Upon this rule, Mr. Jarman remarks as follows: \u2014 \u201c But although, in ease of an immediate <em>gift, </em>it is <em>generally true </em>that a <em>bequest </em>over in the event of the death of the preceding <em>legatee </em>refers to that event occurring in the lifetime of the testator, yet <em>this construction is made only ex necessitate rei, </em>from the absence of any other period to which the words can be referred, as the testator is not supposed to contemplate the event of himself surviving the objects of his bounty:\u201d 2 <em>Jarman on Wills </em>664-5.</p>\n<p data-order=\"41\" data-type=\"legal\" id=\"b334-7\">But this rule, artificial at best, and confessedly not universal in its application, even when the event is <em>death only, </em>and belonging especially to personal property, is reversed <em>when other collateral events </em>are connected with the event of death. Mr. Jarman thus states it: \u2014 \u201c It will commonly be found, it is conceived, that <em>where the context is silent, </em>the words referring to the death of the prior legatee in connection with some collateral event, apply to the contingency happening as well <em>after </em>as before the death of the testator:\u201d 2 <em>Jarman on Wills, </em>687; Allen v. Farthing, same page; and Child <em>v. </em>Giblet, 488.</p>\n<p data-order=\"42\" data-type=\"legal\" id=\"b334-8\">The cases above alluded to as exceptions, in which other events were connected in the will with the event of death, and yet were brought within this artificial rule, are Clayton <em>v. </em>Lowe, 7 <em>Eng. Com. Law </em>218, in which no reason is given for the decision; in which the words are, \u201cor should die leaving child or children,\u201d and of which Mr. Jarman says \u2014 \u201cThe reasons for the conclusion at which the court arrived do not appear.\u201d \u201cWhether the certificate of the Court of King\u2019s Bench was confirmed by the vice-chancellor does not appear. Under such circumstances, it would be <em>unsafe to rely on the ease as a deliberate adjudication </em>in support of so <em>doubtful a </em>principle2 <em>Jarman on Wills </em>692. This case is therefore too apocryphal to sustain the defendant\u2019s construction.</p>\n<p data-order=\"43\" data-type=\"legal\" id=\"b334-9\">The next and only other English case of this class cited by defendants, is that of Doe <em>v. </em>Sparrow, 13 <em>East 359. </em>Here were <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"335\">*335</page-number>three contingencies of death, to wit: 1. \u201c In case of the death of either my son or daughter leaving child or children.\u201d 2. \u201cIn case my said son and daughter shall be both dead at the time of my decease,\u201d then to executors and brother. 3. \u201cIn case of the death of my said son and daughter at the time before mentioned.\u201d</p>\n<p data-order=\"44\" data-type=\"legal\" id=\"b335-6\">In construing this will, Lord Ellenborough says, \u201c The limitations to the executors and to his brother are confined in <em>express terms </em>to the event of the death of his son and daughter <em>in his life</em>time, and <em>from thence it is inferred </em>that he was contemplating a death in his lifetime in the preceding clause.\u201d And further, \u201cthe express restriction to death in testator\u2019s lifetime in one clause, leads the court to infer that in the other clauses death during the same period was intended.\u201d</p>\n<p data-order=\"45\" data-type=\"legal\" id=\"b335-7\">Of this case Mr. Jarman remarks: \u2014 \u201c But this construction was aided by the context, particularly by a gift over of the entire property in case both devisees were dead at the time of the decease of the testator without children, from which the court inferred that in the clause in question he contemplated death at the same period.\u201d 2 <em>Jarman on Wills </em>653. How can this case <em>be </em>a guide for one in which <em>there is no such express limitation?</em></p>\n<p data-order=\"46\" data-type=\"legal\" id=\"b335-8\">In Caldwell <em>v. </em>Skilton, 1 <em>Harris </em>153, the only remaining case of this class cited, the decision is distinctly placed, as to the construction of the will, upon the incongruity which must result from any other construction, and the impossibility of harmonizing-its provisions, or carrying into effect the obvious general intention of the testator, without fixing the time of the testator\u2019s death as.the period for the death of the first taker. This case, like the two preceding, and that of Jenour <em>v. </em>Jenour, 10 <em>Vesey </em>563, cited in support of it, was a tenancy in common to the first takers with survivor-ship, (a condition of things on which the court placed some reliance,) and that survivorship, if treated as unlimited in duration, might entirely defeat the obvious general intention of the testator. Plence, in this case there was a necessity of applying, as to time, that which Mr. Jarman says is \u201cso doubtful a principle.\u201d In the case before the court there is no tenancy in common, with survivorship, nor in any conceivable contingency would the obvious general intention of the testator be frustrated by giving to the words of the will their common and ordinary interpretation.</p>\n<p data-order=\"47\" data-type=\"legal\" id=\"b335-9\">None of the cases above cited connect marriage with the event of death.</p>\n<p data-order=\"48\" data-type=\"legal\" id=\"b335-10\">But the time intended by the testator is in fact fixed by the very sentence which imposes the defeasance and creates the executory estate. \u201cIn case my son Samuel should die <em>before </em>he marries, <em>then\u201d </em>I give, &amp;e. to Joel. Should die ! When? Not generally, or at any time, not in testator\u2019s lifetime, nor with or without issue, as in the cases of limitation, but \u201cbefore he marries.\u201d Marriage was to render indefeasible, not death to render defeasible, the <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"336\">*336</page-number>estate given to Samuel. His non-marriage was the event which made the premises the property of Joel the first moment such non-marriage could be certain, to wit, Samuel\u2019s death. Death wa's never, in the mind of the testator, the contingency on which the estate was to go over, but non-marriage; and death is only named as the farthest boundary of the period for the performance of the condition which should make Samuel\u2019s title indefeasible. Time subsequent to the testator\u2019s own decease was in his mind throughout his whole will; legacies were to be paid from one to six years after his decease; the last-named time being allowed for the trifling sum of \u00bf610. The testator made all the limitations of time he chose to make even in minute matters, and it cannot be supposed that he omitted such limitations as he desired in matters of greater importance.</p>\n<p data-order=\"49\" data-type=\"legal\" id=\"b336-6\">Non-marriage is a good condition of defeasance: 2 <em>Strange </em>1175: \u201cDevise to A in fee, but if he dies under age or unmarried and without issue, then over; all the events must concur to defeat the estate.\u201d</p>\n<p data-order=\"50\" data-type=\"legal\" id=\"b336-7\">Griffith <em>v. </em>Woodward, 1 <em>Yeates </em>316: \u201cIf either of my said sons shall happen to depart this life unmarried and without lawful issue,\u201d then survivorship.

The case finds that Samuel was twenty-two years of age at the date of the will, was .unmarried, and resided with- his fathe2\\ The two unmarried sisters were no doubt also at home.</p>\n<p data-order=\"53\" data-type=\"legal\" id=\"b336-9\">That the testator contemplated some contingency upon which Joel should take \"the place of Samuel and become invested with the property devised to Samuel on the same terms and conditions as Samuel \u201cwas to have held it,\u201d there is no doubt. The devise to Joel is substitutionary to that to Samuel. The contingency which was to determine this substitution was the death of <em>Samuel </em>\u2014 his <em>death in the lifetime of the </em>testator, <em>while yet unmarried. </em>In that event Joel was to take the place of Samuel. An additional payment of \u00bf6460 was imposed on Joel, no legacy out of the land was to be received by him, no share of the residual estate was to be paid to him, but the residual estate was to be divided into other and different shares from what was to have been the case in the event of the property vesting in Samuel.</p>\n<p data-order=\"54\" data-type=\"legal\" id=\"b336-10\">This construction is indeed required by the established rules of law. \u201c All the authorities concur,\u201d says Mr. Justice Rogers, \u201c per<page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"337\">*337</page-number>haps without exception, that, when the gift is immediate, that is, in possession, it is to he treated as intended to provide for the death of the objects of the testator\u2019s bounty in the lifetime of the testator; the devise affording no other point of time to which they could be referred Johnson <em>v. </em>Morton, 10 <em>Barr </em>250. It is not only in case of death simply that the time of it is referred to the death of the testator. Death connected with collateral circumstances, as <em>without leaving </em>children, has been ruled to refer to the period of the testator\u2019s death: Clayton <em>v. </em>Lowe, 6 <em>Barn. &amp; Ald. </em>636, (7 <em>Eng. Com. Law Rep. </em>218.) The authority of this case is faintly impugned by the plaintiff, but is fully sustained by Mr. Justice Bell in the late case of Caldwell <em>v. </em>Skilton, 1 <em>Harris </em>152, which is also direct to the point, and shows that the rule is applied to real as well as personal estate. In the case of Montagu <em>v. </em>Nucella, 1 <em>Russell\u2019s Ch. Rep. </em>165, decided since Clayton <em>v. </em>Lowe, there were two bequests to which the rule was applied.</p>\n<p data-order=\"55\" data-type=\"legal\" id=\"b337-6\">Prior to any of these cases was that of. Doe <em>v. </em>Sparrow, 13 <em>East </em>359, in which death <em>without leaving issue </em>was referred to death in the lifetime of the testator. It is true that <em>\u201c </em>the construction in that case <em>was aided </em>by the context,\u201d but that is no objection to it; and we think that such is the fact also in the present case: Child v. Giblet, <em>3 Myl. &amp; Keen </em>71. Lippincott <em>v. </em>Warden, 14 <em>Ser. &amp; R. </em>115, is disposed of in Caldwell <em>v. </em>Skilton, 1 <em>Harris.</em></p>\n<p data-order=\"56\" data-type=\"legal\" id=\"b337-7\">We submit, therefore, that the rule is too firmly established to be shaken, that where the devise is <em>immediate </em>and <em>absolute, </em>a devise to another, in ease of the death of the first-named devisee, although connected with some collateral circumstance, is substitutionary only, and refers to the death of the first devisee in the lifetime of the testator. There cannot be any difference whether the collateral circumstance be the <em>having issue, having children, </em>or the <em>marriage </em>of the first devisee. The conjunction of the circumstance with the event of the devisee\u2019s death might be Thought to import a contingency in the one case as much as in the other. But the conjunction of such personal circumstances with the event of death does not, under the rule, determine the contingency which the testator contemplated; and to effectuate his intention, and not destroy the estate he has given, it becomes necessary to refer the happening of the event to the period of the testator\u2019s death.</p>\n<p data-order=\"57\" data-type=\"legal\" id=\"b337-8\">The plaintiff, in the course of his argument, dwells on the word \u201cbefore,\u201d in the phrase \u201cshould die <em>before </em>he marries,\u201d and seems to think the force of it decisive of the question. The emphasis however is on the word <em>die, </em>leaving the office of the word <em>before, </em>as a mere preposition, (not an adverb,) having the words <em>he marries </em>for its object, to append the collateral circumstance of marriage to the death.- It will not do, however, to hinge a cause upon a single word, in opposition to the context and general intent of a will. We <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"338\">*338</page-number>may say of this word, as well as of the word <em>then, </em>referred to by the plaintiff, what Lord Hardwicke said of the latter in Beauclerk v. Dormer, 2 <em>Atkyns </em>311: \u201c If the court here were to lay any stress upon the word <em>then, </em>it would he going a great deal too far, for it is too ambiguous to be taken as an adverb of time\u201c then, in a grammatical sense, is an adverb of time, but in the limitation of estates, and framing contingencies, it is a word of reference, and relates to the determination of the first limitation in the estate where the contingency arises.\u201d</p>\n<opinion data-order=\"58\" data-type=\"opinion\" id=\"x999-1\" type=\"majority\">\n<p id=\"b338-5\">The opinion of the court was delivered June 16, by</p>\n<author id=\"b338-6\">Chambers, J.</author>\n<p id=\"Alz\">William Willis, by his will, made in 1800, devised the lands in controversy to his \u201c son Samuel, and to his \u00abheirs and assigns,\u201d to have and to hold \u201cto him my said son Samuel Willis, and to his heirs and assigns for ever, he or they paying thereout and therefor certain legacies.\u201d And in a subsequent part of the will it is provided, \u201c and <em>in ease, my said son Samuel should die before he marries, then </em>all that part of-the estate which I have devised to him, in that case I give and devise to my son Joel Willis, his heirs and assigns, to have and to hold to him my said son Joel, his heirs and assigns for ever, in as full and ample a manner as my son Samuel held, or was to have held the same, and subject to the same conditions and payments,\u201d with a further charge of \u00bf\u00a3460 to his daughters. At the date of the will, Samuel was of the age of twenty-two, unmarried, residing on the mansion farm devised, with his father, who lived about thirteen months after the making of his will. Samuel, at the death of his father, entered into the possession of the land devised, and paid the legacies charged in the will, and died in 1848 intestate, and without having been married. The plaintiffs, devisees of Joel Willis, claim the land in controversy under the limitation contained in the will of William Willis in favour of their testator, Joel Willis. This case has been prepared with great industry and research by the counsel on both sides, who have argued it with much learning and ability.</p>\n<p id=\"b338-7\">It is ever professed by courts, that the construction to be put on wills is to execute and carry out the intention of the testator, if that intention can be discovered, and does not contravene some established rule or principle of law. Artificial rules of law have been adopted from necessity, and called in to aid in giving effect to a general intent, conflicting with some particular intent in the same will, or to supply some obscurity in the full intent of the testator, and to sustain'the policy of the law.</p>\n<p id=\"b338-8\">By the will of William Willis, a fee is devised in the mansion farm to his son Samuel, and the question is, when, and on what event was it made defeasible, and limited over to his son Joel, his heirs and assigns ?</p>\n<p id=\"b339-5\"><page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"339\">*339</page-number>The non-marriage of Samuel was an <em>event </em>that received' the attention of the testator, as worthy of testamentary provision. It was not on the death alone of Samuel that the estate was limited over to Joel, as it is provided \u201cin case my son Samuel should die before he <em>marries, </em>then all that part of my estate which I have devised to him, in that case I give and bequeath to my son Joel Willis, his heirs and assigns.\u201d</p>\n<p id=\"b339-6\">But it is death, without marriage. The limitation over is not .on the contingency of his death in testator\u2019s lifetime, as averred by the defendants, nor is it on the event of his death with or without issue, as in cases of limitation \u2014 but \u201cbefore he marries.\u201d If he dies before his marriage, <em>then, </em>says the testator, I devise the estate to Joel. The estate was to go over on the contingency of the death of Samuel at any time without marriage.</p>\n<p id=\"b339-7\">The property was to pass to Joel when such non-marriage could only become certain, to wit, at Samuel\u2019s death. The manifest intention of testator was, that of his children, Samuel and Joel were the only ones to have and enjoy his mansion farm as provided in his will.</p>\n<p id=\"b339-8\">The testator was providing for the disposition of his estate after his decease, and must be supposed to refer to events, and their occurrence in time subsequent to his death. That time subsequent to his decease was alone in the contemplation of testator is to he inferred from the payment of the legacies charged, which were to extend from one to six years after his decease; and where he imposed limitations of time as to payments and minute matters, we are not to suppose that the occurrence of the marriage of Samuel, which he would seem to have regarded with interest, was not to apply to the devise to Samuel after the death of the testator.</p>\n<p id=\"b339-9\">. The provisions and terms of this will are strong to show that the testator contemplated and provided for the death of Samuel, without marriage, at any period of his life, as the time and event on which the property in controversy was to pass ever to Joel.</p>\n<p id=\"b339-10\">It is contended, on the part of the defendants, that Samuel took an indefeasible estate in fee simple on his father\u2019s death, subject only to payment of legacies, with no other limitation; that Joel, by the will, was to take only in case the devise to Samuel should lapse by his death <em>in the lifetime of their father. </em>To sustain this construction, it was alleged that, by a rule of construction established by authority, a devise over in the event of death, when the first devisee is&gt;to take immediately, is construed to mean death <em>in the lifetime of the testator, </em>and that the rule is not confined to cases where death alone is mentioned <em>without any qualification, </em>but has been applied to cases where the estate is directed to go over if either of the first devisees \u201c <em>should happen to die without child or children lawfully begotten:\u201d </em>Clayton <em>v. </em>Lowe, <em>5 Barn. &amp; </em><page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"340\">*340</page-number><em>Ald. </em>636; or should die without <em>leaving child or children: </em>Doe <em>v. </em>Sparrow, 13 <em>East </em>359; or <em>should die without issue born </em>alive, Caldwell <em>v. </em>Skilton, 1 <em>Harris </em>152.</p>\n<p id=\"b340-6\">Mr. Powell, in the 37th chapter of his treatise on Devises, after reviewing some of the leading eases in relation to the artificial rule, says \u2014 \u201c But in eases of <em>immediate </em>gifts, it is generally true that a bequest over, in the event of the death of the preceding legatee, refers to that event occurring in the lifetime of the testator; yet this construction is only made <em>ex necessitate rei, </em>from the absence of any other period to which the words may be referred, as a testator is not supposed to contemplate the event of himself surviving the objects of his bounty:\u201d <em>2 Pow. Dev. </em>763-65.</p>\n<p id=\"b340-7\">This rule, admitted to be artificial, is not of uniform application where other collateral events are connected with the death. The ease of Lippincott <em>v. </em>Warder, 14 <em>Ser. &amp; R. </em>115, is in conflict with the rule of construction insisted on, and is to be respected from the consideration given to it and exhibited by the learned judge who delivered the opinion. Mr. Jarman states, \u201cIt will commonly be found, it is conceived, that where the <em>context is </em>silent, the words referring to the death of the prior legatee in connection with some collateral event, apply to the contingency happening as well <em>after </em>as before the death of the testator:\u201d 2 <em>Jarman on Wills </em>687. The case of Clayton <em>v. </em>Lowe was not a case of such deliberate adjudication as to be relied on; and in the case of Doe <em>v. </em>Sparrow, 13 <em>East </em>359, Lord Ellenborough, in construing the will, says, \u201cthe limitations to the executors and to his brother are confined in <em>express terms </em>to the event of the death of his son and daughter in <em>his lifetime; </em>and from thence it is inferred that he was contemplating a death in his lifetime in the preceding clause.\u201d</p>\n<p id=\"b340-8\">In Caldwell <em>v. </em>Skilton, 1 <em>Harris </em>153, the decision is distinctly placed, as to the construction of the will, on the evidence of intentj to be inferred from its context, being'in conformity to the rule referred to; and to avoid the incongruity which must result from any other construction, in carrying out the provisions of the'will and the general intention of the testator. The case last referred to as made by this court, was a tenancy in common to the first takers with survivorship, a circumstance that had its influence on the opinion of the court. The opinion of the court, as delivered by Justice Bell, in Caldwell <em>v. </em>Skilton, has our entire approbation. In the case of Johnson <em>v. </em>Morton, 10 <em>Barr </em>245, referred to, words giving an estate of inheritance before the act of 1833, were held from the context to pass a fee; and the artificial limitation of the time of death, was recognised, as applying in that case, where there was a devise to several daughters or the survivor of them; and Justice Rogers, whilst he applied the rule in aid of the intention of the testator to provide for' a death in his lifetime, <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"341\">*341</page-number>says, \u201cthe devise affording no other point of time to which they could be referred.\u201d</p>\n<p id=\"b341-6\">In this case now under consideration, there is no tenancy in common with survivorship; nor in the contingency contemplated, of the limitation over to Joel on the death of Samuel at any time before marriage, would the obvious general intention of the testator be frustrated by giving to the words of the will their common and ordinary interpretation.</p>\n<p id=\"b341-7\">It is to be remarked, that none of the cases referred to and relied on for the defendants, connect marriage with the event of death. Non-marriage is a good condition of defeasance : <em>2 Strange </em>1175; and in Griffith <em>v. </em>Woodward, 1 <em>Yeates </em>316, it was by the will provided, \u201cif either of my said sons shall happen to depart this life unmarried, and without lawful issue, then\u201d the survivor was to enjoy all: it was held that marriage prevented the executory devisee from taking. In the last ease, the court say that the testator \u201cprobably intended to tempt his sons to marry, and therefore subjected their lands to that condition.\u201d If the testator in this ease be considered as holding out an inducement to his son Samuel to marry, by making the estate devised to him absolute on marriage, it must be intended as referring to a marriage not during the short time of the testator\u2019s nearly spent life, but to a time after his death, when Samuel became acquainted with the devise to him of the mansion farm in fee, but with a limitation over to his brother Joel and his heirs in case Samuel should die before he marries.</p>\n<p id=\"b341-8\">In the cases which limit the death to the testator\u2019s lifetime, it is admitted that it is adopted from necessity, in aid of what was considered the general intent of the testator, and was not applied where the first taker is referred to or treated as living at a period subsequent to the death of the testator. That the testator did not contemplate the death of his son Samuel to occur before his own, is, as we have observed, to be inferred from the terms used to express the contingency and the limitation; but is also confirmed by other dispositions in the will in relation to Samuel, which have reference to a time subsequent to testator\u2019s death. The will devises to Samuel the grain which is growing on the ground <em>at testator\u2019s </em>decease, allows him to take at low prices, <em>after testator\u2019s decease, </em>stock which testator shall have left, and other stock at the appraisement; gives him the <em>option </em>and the right to give land to his sisters in lieu of pecuniary legacies, payable <em>one, two, </em>and <em>four </em>years after testator\u2019s decease. These and other provisions, to be executed by Samuel after testator\u2019s decease, are to be regarded in confirmation of the construction we have adopted to effectuate the intention of the testator in limiting the estate over to Joel on the death of Samuel after the testator\u2019s decease, in case Samuel should <em>die before he marries. </em>Samuel having died unmarried, the estate passed by executory devise to the heirs or devisees of Joel <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"342\">*342</page-number>Willis. There is no rule of law contravened by this limitation. That a fee simple may by <em>executory devise </em>be limited after a fee simple vested or contingent, is well established: <em>Fearne on Rem. </em>395-6-7; 2 <em>Bin. </em>532, Hauer\u2019s Lessee <em>v. </em>Sheetz.</p>\n<p id=\"b342-6\">The limitation over is not on an event too remote, but, being to occur within a life in being, is good as an executory devise, as is well settled. However sound public policy may be against locking up estates from alienation or disposition, and protracting the acquisition of the absolute interest in or dominion over property, yet any change of the law on this subject is to be made by legislative provision, and not by the judiciary, who ar.e not to indulge in judicial legislation, but as expounders of the established law are bound to maintain it and the line which divides judicial from legislative functions. Where there exist provisions in the will evidencing a particular intent, and directory in small matters in the distribution of the estate or fund, they must be made to yield and conform to the general intent as manifested and to be executed, and with which they may appear to .conflict. The representatives of Joel are to take the estate in fee, and to hold the same in as full and ample a manner as Samuel held or was to have held the same, and subject to the same conditions \u25a0 and payments; and they are to pay the further sum of \u00a3460, to be divided amongst testator\u2019s daughters or their representatives, as well as refund and pay to the\u2019 representatives of the estate of William Willis, the testator, what Joel or his representatives may have received out of the residuary estate of the testator. Some of the provisions that were personal in their application to Samuel, and not to Joel, cannot apply to Joel or his heirs or devisees, who from necessity must take the said estate discharged from such conditions as were applicable only to Samuel as dying before he marries, which could 'not be annexed to the devise to Joel, who was married, and from paying .over to legatees legacies already paid by Samuel in his lifetime. Such provisions, being not applicable to Joel or his representatives, are to be rejected as immaterial and inoperative at this time, to effectuate the manifest general intent of the testator in limiting his estate to his sons Samuel and Joel.</p>\n<p id=\"b342-7\">It is the opinion of the court on the will of William Willis, that the testator contemplated the death of his son Samuel, <em>whenever it might happen </em>before marriage, as the event on which the estate devised was limited over in fee to Joel, his heirs and <em>assigns; </em>and as Samuel did die before he married, the estate, by the limitation, became -the property of the heirs or devisees of Joel. Under this opinion, the judgment of the court below on the special verdict is reversed, and judgment entered for the plaintiffs \u2014 subject to the payment of the legacies charged on the premises, if not paid, and subject to the payment of four hundred and sixty pounds to the daughters of William Willis or their representatives, and to the <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"343\">*343</page-number>\u2022payment to tbe same, in tbe manner provided in tbe will, of wbat Joel may have received out of the residuary estate, being, as stated, the sum of one hundred and thirty-six pounds, nineteen shillings and nine pence.</p>\n</opinion>\n</casebody>\n",
