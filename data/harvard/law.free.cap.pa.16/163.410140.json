The act of 1844 withdrew the right to undrawn balances. By the act of 11th April 1848, all school districts were made accepting districts, and it was provided that those districts which complied with the school system should receive a portion of the township taxes paid for <em>two </em>years. The 25 per cent, does not equal the amount which had been withdrawn from the township by the act of 1843. The act of 11th April 1848 provided that the two years should commence on the 1st Monday of June 1848, and it was contended by him that <em>all payments made before the </em>1st <em>Monday of June </em>1850 were liable to the abatement of 25 per cent. When the taxes were paid by Manheim township in May and on 1st day of June 1850, the school year for 1850 had not begun to run. That it was a fallacy to say that the payments made on and previous, to the 1st day of June 1850 were not <em>then due and payable. </em>The tax had been assessed, the duplicates had been committed to the collectors, and the- taxes .were payable within thirty days, though the collector could not levy till the thirty days had expired. The 1st day of June 1850 was Saturday, and the school year which terminated on the first <em>Monday </em>of June had not then expired.</p>\n<attorneys data-order=\"37\" data-type=\"attorneys\" id=\"b166-9\"><em>Mathiot, </em>for the respondent.</attorneys>\n<p data-order=\"38\" data-type=\"legal\" id=\"AB8b\">He contended that under a proper construction of the act of 11th day of April, A. D. 1848, the relators are entitled to a percentage upon State revenue derived from their school district for <em>two years </em>only, to wit, the years 1848 and 1849, and this has been paid to them. If they have thought proper to advance the amount of their State tax for the <em>third year, </em>viz. 1850, so that its payment falls into the treasury prior to the first Monday of June 1850, this does not enable them to draw their percentage for <em>three </em>years.,</p>\n<p data-order=\"39\" data-type=\"legal\" id=\"b166-10\">The payment of the tax for 1850 was an advancement, by reason of which the township, under the act of 1844, became entitled to an abatement of five per cent.; but it was never contemplated that the school directors would set up a claim for the abatement of twenty-five per cent, upon money which was not due and payable to the commonwealth during the two school years.</p>\n<p data-order=\"40\" data-type=\"legal\" id=\"b166-11\">The construction placed upon the act by the auditor-general, the superintendent of common schools, as well as the court below, <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"167\">*167</page-number>should not be disturbed. He cited act May 31st, 1844, <em>Pam.

Under the act of 1848 recited, the school directors of that township, during the month of May of that year, did assess and levy a tax, as required by existing laws, to enable school districts to receive their portion of the State appropriation.</p>\n<p id=\"b167-11\">The whole amount of taxes assessed, levied, and charged against the township of Manheim for State purposes, and paid over to the county treasury, after exonerations and commissions, for the year 1848, was $3441.84, and of this there was paid by the county treasurer of Lancaster county to the treasurer of Manheim school <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"168\">*168</page-number>district in 1849 the sum of $872.58, which was an excess of $12.12 beyond the 25 per cent, to which such district was entitled.</p>\n<p id=\"Ahy\">The total amount of taxes assessed, levied, and paid by the same township, after exonerations and commissions, to the treasurer of Lancaster county for.State purposes, was the sum of $8569.02. This year\u2019s State tax was settled up on the 11th February 1850, being for the year 1849, at which time there was paid by the county treasurer of Lancaster county, to the treasurer of the Manheim school district, the sum of $892.25, being 25 per cent, on the amount of the state taxes for that township thus paid in for 1849. Are not the two yearly payments made as stated by the treasurer of Lancaster county to the treasurer of Manheim school district a full compliance with the legislative appropriation under the act of 1848 ? The school directors say not, for that afterwards there was paid by Manheim township into the Lancaster county treasury, on the 2d May 1850, $50, and 1st June 1850, $3419.10, for State purposes, being nearly the total of the State tax of that township for the year 1850; and on this they claim to be paid 25 per cent, by the county treasurer, as on moneys paid in by Manheim township into the county treasury for State purposes <em>during </em>the school year which ended on first Monday of June 1850. This is refused by the county treasurer of Lancaster county; and by the proceeding in this matter it is sought to compel him to pay with the aid of the process of this court. In putting a construction on this act to effectuate the intention of the legislature, reference must be had to the system of taxation.within this commonwealth. The taxes assessed in the autumn and winter of one year are collected and paid over during the ensuing year, and are called the tax of the latter year. To induce the counties to pay their quota of State tax as early as fifteen days before the first of August of each year, an abatement of 5 per cent, is allowed; and if the county\u2019s quota is not paid into the state treasury before the second Tuesday of January following, the county delinquent is therefore charged 5 per cent, interest.</p>\n<p id=\"b168-7\">Whilst the State encourages the payment of the State tax by the middle of July, by allowing the abatement it does not treat the county as a defaulter until after the second Tuesday of January. The township of Manheim did not settle up its State tax for 1849 till the 11th of February 1850, and within four months thereafter pays into the county treasury $3419, being nearly the total of its tax assessed for State purposes for that year. This unprecedented despatch, in paying over such an amount for State taxation is accounted for by the claim made of 25 per cent, on the amount last paid, which, in effect, if allowed, would be to give 25 per cent, on the State tax for a third year, instead of two. The legislature may be supposed, in estimating the amount of their grant for building school-houses, to have had regard to the amount assessed and <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"169\">*169</page-number>paid by such townships for State purposes annually, and did choose to grant as a bounty to the township for building school-houses, one-fourth of the said State tax for two years. It was not, we presume, anticipated that the townships who were to be partakers of this bounty would hasten their yearly payments, so as to crowd three years\u2019 assessments for State purposes into payments during the two school years. If payment within the time were alone the measure, then if the township had been delinquent for balances of State taxes for the previous year, and had, after the passage of the act of 1848, elected to have paid up all its arrearages within the next school year, it was, under the construction placed on tho law by the claimants, to have 25 per cent, on this indebtedness.</p>\n<p id=\"b169-6\">By confining the bounty of the legislature to one-fourth of the tax assessed and paid over for the next two school years, the intention of the legislature, we believe, will be fulfilled, and the execution of the law will be certain and uniform with all the townships to which it may apply.</p>\n<p id=\"b169-7\">Statutes are to be construed so as may best effectuate the intention of the makers, which sometimes may be collected from the cause or occasion of passing the statute, and, when discovered, it ought to be followed with judgment and discretion in the construction, though that construction may seem contrary to the letter of the statute. It is said a thing within the letter of the statute is not within the statute unless it be within the intention of the makers; and such construction ought to be put on it as does not suffer it to be eluded: People <em>v. </em>Utica Ins. Co. 15 <em>Johns. Rep. </em>381; 8 <em>Bac. Abr. </em>tit. <em>Statutes </em>247.</p>\n<p id=\"b169-8\">Entertaining the opinion that the appropriation by the act of 1848, has been complied with by the payments made by the treasurer of the county of Lancaster to the treasurer of the Manheim school district, being 25 per cent, on the amount of the State taxes assessed and paid by that township for the two years contemplated, this court refuses the mandamus applied for to compel the payment demanded on the tax assessed and paid for a third year. To allow this would be to elude the law and extort from the treasury more than the bounty intended by the legislature. If the court should be mistaken in this construction of the act of Assembly, and are instrumental in curtailing the legislative bounty to the school directors below what was intended by the legislature, it will be competent to the .legislature to remedy it by subsequent enactment. Petition of relators refused.</p>\n</opinion>\n</casebody>\n",
