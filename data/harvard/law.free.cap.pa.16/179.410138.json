Before the grain was cut,' the land was sold at sheriff\u2019s sale, under proceedings on the mortgage commenced after the making of the lease: <em>Held, </em>that the grantee of the purchaser of the land was entitled to recover damages from the cropper for cutting and removing the grain.</headnotes>\n<summary data-order=\"2\" data-type=\"summary\" id=\"b179-10\">Ebjior to the Common Pleas of <em>Lancaster county.</em></summary>\n<summary data-order=\"3\" data-type=\"summary\" id=\"b179-11\">This was a suit by George Levan <em>v. </em>Levi W.

Same day, acknowledged.</summary>\n<summary data-order=\"8\" data-type=\"summary\" id=\"b180-6\">April 1, 1848, deed; Farmers\u2019 Bank of Lancaster to George Levan, plaintiff, for same property, and on the same day Levan entered into possession of the premises.</summary>\n<summary data-order=\"9\" data-type=\"summary\" id=\"b180-7\">At the time of the sale by the sheriff to the Bank, and of the conveyance by the Bank to Levan as above stated, there was a growing crop of rye on about eight acres, parcel of the premises mortgaged and sold. In July 1848, Levi W. Groff, the defendant, cut and carried away the said rye with the straw thereof, and kept and retained the same with the straw, and refused upon demand to deliver the same or any part thereof to the plaintiff. The quantity of rye was 132 bushels, of the value of 65 cents per bushel; and the straw, 400 bundles, at 6 cents per bundle; making the whole value $109.80. The plaintiff seeks to recover this, allowing defendant a credit of $21.45, the expense of harvesting the grain: making his claim $88.35, with interest from 1st August 1848.</summary>\n<summary data-order=\"10\" data-type=\"summary\" id=\"b180-8\">The <em>defendant </em>claimed the whole of the said rye and straw, on the following facts: \u2014 On the 15th day of <em>September </em>A. D. 1847, he rented the eight-acre field on which the grain spoken of grew, from Samuel W. Groff, for\u2022 <em>the ensuing </em>year, rent to be paid in advance, and on that day paid the price agreed on, to wit, $142, as per receipt of Samuel W. Groff of that date. He took possession and sowed the grain; and protected, harvested, and took away the grain.</summary>\n<summary data-order=\"11\" data-type=\"summary\" id=\"b180-9\">Defendant claimed all the grain; or that he was entitled at least to <em>the half part </em>thereof; which is the usual condition on which land is given out to farm.</summary>\n<summary data-order=\"12\" data-type=\"summary\" id=\"b180-10\">If the court, on this statement of facts, should be of opinion that the plaintiff is entitled to recover, then judgment to be entered in his favor for such damages as he is entitled to, with costs: otherwise, judgment for defendant.</summary>\n<summary data-order=\"13\" data-type=\"summary\" id=\"b180-11\">The court.entered judgment for $88.35, with interest, being the whole of the claim of the plaintiff.</summary>\n<summary data-order=\"14\" data-type=\"summary\" id=\"b180-12\">It was assigned for error, that the judgment should have been for the defendant below, and not for the plaintiff.</summary>\n<attorneys data-order=\"15\" data-type=\"attorneys\" id=\"b180-13\">Stevens, for plaintiff in error.</attorneys>\n<p data-order=\"16\" data-type=\"legal\" id=\"APO\">In Pennsylvania, grain growing on land is personal, and not real estate; and if sold by defendant, or by judicial sale, before the land is sold by the sheriff, will go to the purchaser, and not to the purchaser of the land. This is very clearly decided in Myers\u2019s Assignee <em>v. </em>White, 1 <em>Rawle </em>353, and Stambaugh <em>v. </em>Yeates, 2 <em>id. </em>161.</p>\n<p data-order=\"17\" data-type=\"legal\" id=\"b180-14\">In Myers <em>v. </em>White, the court show, that notwithstanding a mortgage, the mortgagor may lease the mortgaged premises or sell the grain growing on it; and that a sale on the mortgage before the <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"181\">*181</page-number>termination of the lease, or the harvesting of the grain, does not give the grain to the purchaser.</p>\n<p data-order=\"18\" data-type=\"legal\" id=\"b181-6\">The act of 16th June 1836 seems to provide for two cases,\u2014 where the person is in possession of land sold by the sheriff by <em>title </em>younger than the encumbrance on which it was sold; and by a <em>lease </em>also younger.</p>\n<p data-order=\"19\" data-type=\"legal\" id=\"b181-7\">The 119th section of the act of 16th June 1836, relating to executions, provides \u201c that if any lands or tenements shall be sold on execution as- aforesaid, which at the time of such sale or after-wards shall be held or possessed by a tenant or lessee, or person holding,\u201d &amp;e., \u201c the purchaser, on receiving the deed, shall be deemed the landlord of such tenant, lessee, or other person, and shall have the like remedies to recover any rents,\u201d &amp;c., \u201cas such defendant might have had if no such sale had been made.\u201d It is very evident that the legislature intended to authorize an eviction only when the person in possession held as purchaser by title subsequent to the judgment; and to give the purchaser at sheriff\u2019s sale, only the rights of the landlord, when the defendant was out of possession, and the land farmed by a tenant. Certainly, such lease or tenancy must be <em>bona fide, </em>and not made to defraud .the mortgage in anticipation of a sale. Here no such fraud is found or pretended. It would be ruinous to hold that property, which had been mortgaged for five or ten years, could not be rented, or grain raised by a tenant, because possibly the mortgagees might sue out a scire facias, and, in two months after grain was sowed, sell on a levari facias, and seize the crops of the tenant. By such doctrine the mortgagor would be deprived of the profits of his property, while it was uncertain whether his creditor- would sell him out; and the cultivation of the soil would be greatly discouraged.</p>\n<p data-order=\"20\" data-type=\"legal\" id=\"b181-8\">But even if the purchaser could have terminated this lease on notice, it was not done here. On the 1st April after the sale, the purchaser\u2019s vendee took possession of the balance of the property, the tenant still holding the eight acres so far as was necessary to protect the grain and harvest it. <em>He had in fact never resided on the property, renting only the field in question. </em>If therefore the sheriff\u2019s vendee had any claim, it was only as landlord entitled to the rent agreed on by the mortgagor. If it be averred that the rent was paid in advance, that can make no difference, as it was paid according to the terms of the lease. This point was well considered and decided in the Bank <em>v. </em>Ege, 9 <em>Watts </em>436. That ease and Myers <em>v. </em>White are precisely like the present.</p>\n<p data-order=\"21\" data-type=\"legal\" id=\"b181-9\">The case of Sallade <em>v. </em>James, 6 <em>Barr </em>144, seems hostile to the above reasoning, and to other adjudged cases. That opinion seems to have been but slightly considered, and does not profess to overrule previous cases. At the worst, plaintiff below and in error can claim but the <em>half </em>of the grain, being all that the landlord could have claimed if the land had been worked on the shares.</p>\n<attorneys data-order=\"22\" data-type=\"attorneys\" id=\"A1d\"><page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"182\">*182</page-number><em>Bra\u00f1Jclin, </em>for defendant.</attorneys>\n<p data-order=\"23\" data-type=\"legal\" id=\"AqFs\">This case is precisely similar in the facts to the case of Sallade <em>v. </em>James, 6 <em>Barr </em>144, the syllabus of which is \u2014 \u201cA judgment was recovered against the landlord prior to the execution of a lease for years at a rent payable in advance. After payment of the rent, and sowing of the crop, by the tenant, the estate of the landlord was sold by the sheriff under the prior judgment. The purchaser, and not the tenant, is entitled to the growing crop.\u201d</p>\n<p data-order=\"24\" data-type=\"legal\" id=\"b182-6\">That case is sustained by other authorities. It is too late to contend that a purchaser at sheriff\u2019s sale may not elect to disaffirm a lease made after the mortgage or judgment under which he purchases. This point-must be considered as settled by the'cases, 4 <em>Watts </em>195, McCormick <em>v. </em>McMurtrie; 9 <em>Watts </em>439, Bank <em>v. </em>Ege; 4 <em>W. &amp; Ser. </em>535, Hempfield <em>v. </em>Tevis; 5 <em>id. </em>432, Menough\u2019s Appeal.</p>\n<opinion data-order=\"25\" data-type=\"opinion\" id=\"x999-1\" type=\"majority\">\n<p id=\"b182-7\">The opinion of the court was delivered May 26, by</p>\n<author id=\"b182-8\">Coulter, J.</author>\n<p id=\"ACS\">This case is ruled by Sallade <em>v. </em>James, 6 <em>Barr </em>144, and Bear <em>v. </em>Bitzer decided at this term. The circumstance of Levi W. Groff being <em>a cropper </em>makes no difference in the application of the law to the case, because it has been ruled by this court that the 119th section of the act of 1836 is not imperative on the purchaser at sheriff\u2019s sale, inasmuch as he claims by a title paramount to the tenant\u2019s right. In this case, however, the cropper or tenant cut and carried away the whole crop, and claimed it because he had paid the rent in advance; thus disavowing the act of Assembly as for his benefit. But his lease being after the judgment and levy, and there being no severance by a sale, the purchaser\u2019s right was absolute.</p>\n<p id=\"b182-9\">Judgment affirmed.</p>\n</opinion>\n</casebody>\n",
