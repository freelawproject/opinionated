He argues that the district court erred in going beyond the statute of conviction and the charging instrument to determine that a 16-level increase in his offense level was warranted under U.S.S.G. \u00a7 2L1.2(b)(1)(A)(vii). This argument is foreclosed by our decision in <em>United States v. Sanchez-Garcia, </em>319 F.3d 677 (5th Cir.2003).</p>\n<p id=\"b447-21\">Robles again challenges the 16-level increase in his offense level pursuant to U.S.S.G. \u00a7 2L1.2(b)(1)(A)(vii) on the basis that his 1996 conviction for alien transporting is not an alien smuggling offense. He acknowledges that this argument is foreclosed by <em>United States v. Solis-Campozano, </em>312 F.3d 164 (5th Cir.2002), but seeks to preserve the issue for possible further review. In <em>Solis-Campozano, </em>312 F.3d at 167-68, we held that the term \u201calien smuggling offense,\u201d as used in U.S.S.G. \u00a7 2L1.2(b)(1)(A) includes the offense of transporting aliens within the United States. Thus, the 16-level increase to Robles\u2019 offense level was not error.</p>\n<p id=\"b447-22\">Robles argues that the \u201cfelony\u201d and \u201caggravated felony\u201d provisions of 8 U.S.C. \u00a7 1326(b) are unconstitutional because a prior felony conviction is an element of the offense of illegal re-entry, and not merely a sentence enhancement, and should have been charged in the indictment and proven beyond a reasonable doubt. He acknowledges that his argument is foreclosed by <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"410\">*410</page-number>the Supreme Court\u2019s decision in <em>Almendarez-Torres v. United States, </em>523 U.S. 224, 239-47, 118 S.Ct. 1219, 140 L.Ed.2d 350 (1998), but seeks to preserve it for possible further review in light of <em>Apprendi v. New Jersey, </em>530 U.S. 466, 490, 120 S.Ct. 2348, 147 L.Ed.2d 435 (2000). <em>Apprendi </em>did not overrule <em>Almendarez-Torres. See Apprendi </em>530 U.S. at 489-90, 120 S.Ct. 2348. We must follow <em>Almendarez-Torres </em>\u201cunless and until the Supreme Court itself determines to overrule it.\u201d <em>United States v.
