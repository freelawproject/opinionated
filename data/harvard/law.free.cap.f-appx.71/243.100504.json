The district court granted Perry\u2019s motion to reopen the appeal period under Fed. R.App. P. 4(a)(6), which permits a district court to reopen the appeal period as long as the motion requesting such relief is filed within 180 days after entry of the order or seven days after \u201creceiv[ing] notice of the entry, whichever is earlier.\u201d Because we must examine our jurisdiction sua sponte in all cases, <em>Snowden v. CheckPoint Check Cashing, </em>290 F.3d 631, 635 <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"244\">*244</page-number>(4th Cir.), <em>cert. denied, </em>537 U.S. 1087, 123 S.Ct. 695, 154 L.Ed.2d 631 (2002), and it is unclear whether Perry\u2019s motion was filed within the requisite time period, we remand.</p>\n<p id=\"b282-4\">Here, the record is unclear as to when Perry received a copy of the docket sheet on which the district court entered its order denying his \u00a7 2254 petition. See Fed. R.App. P. 4(a)(7). Receipt of the docket sheet provides adequate notice to open the seven-day window in Rule 4(a)(6). <em>See McDaniel v. Moore, </em>292 F.3d 1304, 1305 06 (11th Cir.), <em>cert. denied, </em>537 U.S. 1005, 123 S.Ct. 493, 154 L.Ed.2d 402 (2002). Because we cannot determine on the record before us whether Perry received notice on September 25, 2002, or on September 30, 2002, we remand this case to the district court for the court to make a factual finding as to when Perry received notice of the denial of his \u00a7 2254 petition. The record, as supplemented, will then be returned to this court for further review.</p>\n<p id=\"b282-5\">\n<em>REMANDED.</em>\n</p>\n</opinion>\n</casebody>\n",
