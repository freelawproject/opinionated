We have reviewed the record and find no reversible error. Accordingly, we affirm substantially on the reasoning of the district court. <em>See Perry-Bey v. City of Norfolk, </em>No. CA-02-7-2 (E.D.Va. Oct. 31, 2002). We dispense with oral argument because the facts and legal contentions are adequately presented in the materials before the court and argument would not aid the decisional process.</p>\n<p id=\"b304-15\">\n<em>AFFIRMED.</em>\n</p>\n</opinion>\n</casebody>\n",
