He was sentenced to 112 months in prison. Wright appeals. His attorney has filed a brief in accordance with <em>Anders v. California, </em>386 U.S. 738, 87 S.Ct. 1396, 18 L.Ed.2d 493 (1967), raising two claims but stating that there are no meritorious issues for appeal. Wright has filed a pro se supplemental brief. We affirm.</p>\n<p id=\"b283-18\">Wright, a convicted felon, entered a store carrying a gun. Wright admits that he \u201cshowed\u201d the gun to a store employee who confronted him. In South Carolina, pointing or presenting a firearm at another person is a felony punishable by five years in prison. S.C.Code Ann. \u00a7 16-23-410 (2003).</p>\n<p id=\"b283-20\">Our review of the record discloses full compliance with Fed.R.Crim.P. 11. Further, the four-level enhancement under <em>U.S. Sentencing Guidelines Manual </em>\u00a7 2K2.1(b)(5) (2002) was proper, in light of Wright\u2019s violation of \u00a7 16-23-410. Finally, because ineffective assistance of counsel is not apparent on the face of the record, Wright should raise this claim, if at all, in a motion brought pursuant to 28 U.S.C. \u00a7 2255 (2000), rather than on direct appeal. <em>See United States v. Richardson, </em>195 F.3d 192, 198 (4th Cir.1999).</p>\n<p id=\"b283-21\">We therefore affirm. As required by <em>Anders, </em>we have reviewed the entire record and have found no meritorious issues for appeal. This court requires that counsel inform his client, in writing, of his right to petition the Supreme Court of the United States for further review. If Wright requests that a petition be filed, but counsel believes that such a petition would be frivolous, counsel may move in this court to withdraw from representation. Counsel\u2019s motion must state that counsel served a copy of the motion on Wright. We dispense with oral argument because the facts and legal contentions are adequately presented in the materials before the court and argument would not aid the decisional process.</p>\n<p id=\"b283-22\">\n<em>AFFIRMED.</em>\n</p>\n</opinion>\n</casebody>\n",
