Hunter (Hunter) appeals from the district court\u2019s order granting summary judgment to Exxon Mobil Corporation (Exxon). Hunter alleges that Exxon is liable for his injuries sustained while working on an offshore drilling platform that is owned in part and operated by Exxon. Hunter was employed by an independent contractor hired by Exxon to perform ongoing maintenance work on the drilling platform.</p>\n<p id=\"b386-25\">We have reviewed the record and the district court\u2019s opinion and find no error. Exxon did not control the activity in which Hunter was engaged when he was injured. <em>See Redinger v. Living, Inc., </em>689 S.W.2d 415, 418 (Tex.1985). Hunter\u2019s accident was not caused by Exxon\u2019s negligence or hidden premises defects on the Hoover-Diana platform. <em>See Shell Chem. Co. v. Lamb, </em>493 S.W.2d 742, 746-47 (Tex.1973). Consequently, Exxon is not liable for Hunter\u2019s injuries as a matter of law. <em>See Thomas v. Internorth, Inc., </em>790 F.2d 1253, 1255 (5th Cir.1986).</p>\n<p id=\"b386-26\">AFFIRMED.</p>\n<footnote label=\"*\">\n<p id=\"b386-21\"> Pursuant to 5th Cir. R. 47.5, the court has determined that this opinion should not be published and is not precedent except under the limited circumstances set forth in 5th Cir. R. 47.5.4.</p>\n</footnote>\n</opinion>\n</casebody>\n",
