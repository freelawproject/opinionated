The order affirmed, without opinion, the immigration judge\u2019s order denying Sumaray\u2019s applications for asylum, withholding of removal, and protection under the Convention Against Torture. For the reasons discussed below, we deny the petition for review.</p>\n<p id=\"b303-7\">Sumaray first claims that the Board erred in affirming the decision of the immigration judge without opinion, after review by a single Board member, in accordance with the procedure set out in 8 C.F.R. \u00a7 1003.1(a)(7) (2003). We have reviewed Sumaray\u2019s challenges to the Board\u2019s use of this streamlined procedure and find them to be without merit. <em>See Georgis v. Ashcroft, </em>328 F.3d 962, 967 (7th Cir.2003); <em>Mendoza v. United States Attorney Gen., </em>327 F.3d 1283, 1288-89 (11th Cir.2003); <em>Soadjede v. Ashcroft, </em>324 F.3d 830, 832-33 (5th Cir.2003); <em>Gonzalez-Oropeza v. United States Attorney Gen., </em>321 F.3d 1331, 1333-34 (11th Cir.2003); <em>Albathani v. INS, </em>318 F.3d 365, 375-79 (1st Cir.2003); <em>see also Khattak v. Ashcroft, </em>332 F.3d 250, 253 (4th Cir.2003) (rejecting a challenge to the Board\u2019s summary affirmance procedure on retroactivity grounds and concluding that \u201callowing summary opinions in clear cases is nothing more than a procedural change that does not affect substantive rights\u201d). We further find that summary affirmance was appropriate in this case under the factors set forth in \u00a7 1003.1(a)(7)(ii).</p>\n<p id=\"b303-8\">Next, Sumaray challenges the immigration judge\u2019s finding that he failed to demonstrate a well-founded fear of future persecution. The decision to grant or deny asylum relief is conclusive \u201cunless manifestly contrary to the law and an abuse of discretion.\u201d 8 U.S.C. \u00a7 1252(b)(4)(D) (2000). We conclude that the record supports the immigration judge\u2019s conclusion that Sumaray failed to establish his eligibility for asylum. <em>See </em>8 C.F.R. \u00a7 1208.13(a) (2003); <em>Gonahasa v. INS, </em>181 F.3d 538, 541 (4th Cir.1999). As the decision in this case is not manifestly contrary to law, we cannot grant the relief that Sumaray seeks.</p>\n<p id=\"b303-10\">Accordingly, we deny Sumaray\u2019s petition for review. We dispense with oral argument because the facts and legal contentions are adequately presented in the materials before the court and argument would not aid the decisional process.</p>\n<p id=\"b303-11\">\n<em>PETITION DENIED.</em>\n</p>\n</opinion>\n</casebody>\n",
