The district court sentenced him to 115 months in prison and a five-year term of supervised release. Morales now appeals the district court\u2019s judgment. Morales argues that he was denied the effective assistance of counsel in litigating his involuntariness claim during sentencing.</p>\n<p id=\"b437-6\">As a general rule, this court declines to review claims of ineffective assistance of counsel on direct appeal, although we may do so in exceptional cases. <em>See United States v. Higdon, </em>832 F.2d 312, 314 (5th Cir.1987); <em>United States v. Gibson, </em>55 F.3d 173, 179 (5th Cir.1995); <em>see also Massaro v. United States, </em>\u2014 U.S. -, 123 S.Ct. 1690, 155 L.Ed.2d 714 (2003). This is not the exceptional case. Accordingly, we decline to review Morales\u2019 ineffective-assistance claim in this direct appeal. The judgment of the district court is AFFIRMED.</p>\n<footnote label=\"*\">\n<p id=\"b437-10\"> Pursuant to 5th Cir.
