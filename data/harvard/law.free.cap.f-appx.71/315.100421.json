The district court remanded the action after determining that the allegations in Cabello\u2019s removal petition did not meet the requirements of 28 U.S.C. \u00a7 1443.</p>\n<p id=\"b354-18\">Cabello argues that 28 U.S.C. \u00a7 1443 does not require allegations of racial discrimination. Cabello\u2019s argument is contrary to <em>Johnson v. Mississippi </em>421 U.S. 213, 219, 95 S.Ct. 1591, 44 L.Ed.2d 121 (1975), in which the Supreme Court emphasized that \u201c[cjlaims that prosecution and conviction will violate rights under constitutional or statutory provisions of general applicability or under statutes not protecting against racial discrimination will not suffice.\u201d To accomplish removal pursuant to 28 U.S.C. \u00a7 1443, Cabello must demonstrate that his claims involve the denial of rights that arise under a federal law providing specific rights stated in terms of racial equality and that he has been denied or cannot enforce the specified federal rights in the state courts due to some formal expression of state law. <em>State of Texas v. Gulf Water Benefaction Co., </em>679 F.2d 85, 86 (5th Cir.1982) citing <em>Johnson, </em>421 U.S. at 219. Cabello concedes that his claims do not involve racial discrimination and he has therefore not made the required showing.</p>\n<p id=\"b354-19\">Cabello also seeks appointment of counsel and requests that his attorney be granted leave to file a supplemental brief. Cabello does not assert that exceptional <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"317\">*317</page-number>circumstances exist to warrant the appointment of counsel. <em>See Ulmer v. Chancellor, </em>691 F.2d 209, 212-13 (5th Cir.1982).</p>\n<p id=\"b355-5\">The district court\u2019s decision is AFFIRMED; Motion for appointment of counsel is DENIED.</p>\n<footnote label=\"*\">\n<p id=\"b354-14\"> Pursuant to 5th Cir. R. 47.5, the court has determined that this opinion should not be published and is not precedent except under the limited circumstances set forth in 5th Cir. R. 47.5.4.</p>\n</footnote>\n</opinion>\n</casebody>\n",
