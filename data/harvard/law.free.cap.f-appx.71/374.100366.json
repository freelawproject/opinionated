Johnson argues that the district court committed reversible error by questioning <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"375\">*375</page-number>him and other witnesses in a manner which deprived him of a fair trial. Although Johnson cites in his statement of facts several instances of the judge\u2019s questioning of various witnesses, he argues that the most egregious interventions occurred during the questioning of Javier Perez-Rangel, who was one of the illegal aliens in Johnson\u2019s trailer, and of Johnson himself.</p>\n<p id=\"b413-5\">Johnson concedes that, because he did not object to the court\u2019s questions, review of the issue is limited to plain error. <em>See United States v. Saenz, </em>134 F.3d 697, 701 (5th Cir.1998); <em>United States v. Calverley, </em>37 F.3d 160, 162-64 (5th Cir.1994) (en banc). We have reviewed the trial court\u2019s actions in light of the entire record, including the court\u2019s curative instructions, and have determined that Johnson has not demonstrated <em>plain error. See Calverley, </em>37 F.3d at 162-64. Accordingly, the district court\u2019s judgment is AFFIRMED.</p>\n<footnote label=\"*\">\n<p id=\"b412-31\"> Pursuant to 5th Cir R. 47.5, the court has determined that this opinion should not be published and is not precedent except under the limited circumstances set forth in 5th Cir R. 47.5.4.</p>\n</footnote>\n</opinion>\n</casebody>\n",
