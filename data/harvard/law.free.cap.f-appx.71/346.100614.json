R. Civ. P. 41(a)(1) notice of dismissal. TU\u2019s motion to voluntarily dismiss the appeal is DENIED. Because TU has shown no error on the part of the district court, we AFFIRM that court\u2019s denial of TU\u2019s motion to strike. <em>See Esmark Apparel, Inc. v. James, </em>10 F.3d 1156, 1163 (5th Cir. 1994); <em>Strong v. BellSouth Telecomms.

R.App. P. 38; <em>see also Diaz v. Methodist Hasp., </em>46 F.3d 492, 498 (5th Cir. 1995). Accordingly, his motions are DENIED.</p>\n<p id=\"b384-21\">DENIAL OF MOTION TO STRIKE AFFIRMED; ALL OUTSTANDING MOTIONS DENIED.</p>\n<footnote label=\"*\">\n<p id=\"b384-17\"> Pursuant to 5th Cir.
