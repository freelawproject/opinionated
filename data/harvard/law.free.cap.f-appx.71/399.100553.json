Mills argues that 21 U.S.C. \u00a7\u00a7 841(a) and (b) were rendered facially unconstitutional by <em>Apprendi v. New Jersey, </em>530 U.S. 466, 490, 120 S.Ct. 2348, 147 L.Ed.2d 435 (2000). Mills concedes that his argument is foreclosed by our opinion in <em>United States v. Slaughter, </em>238 F.3d 580, 581-82 (5th Cir. 2000) (revised opinion), <em>cert. denied, </em>532 U.S. 1045, 121 S.Ct. 2015, 149 L.Ed.2d 1015 (2001), which rejected a broad <em>Ap</em>prendi-based attack on the constitutionality of that statute. He raises the issue only to preserve it for Supreme Court review. A panel of this court cannot overrule a <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"400\">*400</page-number>prior panel\u2019s decision in the absence of an intervening contrary or superseding decision by this court sitting en banc or by the United States Supreme Court. <em>Burge v. Parish of St. Tammany, </em>187 F.3d 452, 466 (5th Cir.1999). No such decision overruling <em>Slaughter </em>exists. Accordingly, Mills\u2019s argument is foreclosed.</p>\n<p id=\"b438-4\">AFFIRMED.</p>\n<footnote label=\"*\">\n<p id=\"b437-24\"> Pursuant to 5th Cir.
