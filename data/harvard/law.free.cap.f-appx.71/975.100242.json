United States, </em>537 U.S. 522, 123 S.Ct. 1072, 155 L.Ed.2d 88 (2003)\u201d. Melvin Quick seeks to appeal the district court\u2019s order denying relief on his motion filed under 28 U.S.C. \u00a7 2255 (2000). Because we find that he fails to make a substantial showing of the denial of a constitutional right as discussed below, we deny a certificate of appealability and dismiss the appeal.</p>\n<p id=\"b1013-24\">The district court, in rendering its decision, dismissed Quick\u2019s amended \u00a7 2255 claims as time-barred under the AEDPA. Under prevailing Fourth Circuit caselaw at that time, Quick\u2019s conviction was considered final as of the time this court issued its mandate affirming the conviction. <em>See United States v. Torres, </em>211 F.3d 836, 839 (4th Cir.2000). The Supreme Court abrogated the rule announced in <em>Torres </em>in its recent opinion in <em>Clay, </em>and held that a federal criminal conviction becomes final when the time expires for filing a petition for certiorari in the Supreme Court contesting the appellate court\u2019s affirmation of the conviction. <em>Clay, </em>123 S.Ct. at 1079. Thus, in light of <em>Clay, </em>we now find that Quick\u2019s amended claims were timely filed under the AEDPA.</p>\n<p id=\"b1013-25\">Quick may not appeal from the denial of relief on his \u00a7 2255 motion, however, unless a circuit justice or judge issues a certificate of appealability. 28 U.S.C. \u00a7 2253(c)(1) (2000). A certificate of appealability will not issue absent \u201ca substan<page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"976\">*976</page-number>tial showing of the denial of a constitutional right.\u201d 28 U.S.C. \u00a7 2253(c)(2) (2000). A prisoner satisfies this standard by demonstrating that reasonable jurists would find both that his constitutional claims are debatable and that any dispositive procedural rulings by the district court are also debatable or wrong. <em>See Miller-El v. Cockrell, </em>537 U.S. 322, 123 S.Ct. 1029, 1040, 154 L.Ed.2d 931 (2003); <em>Slack v. McDaniel, </em>529 U.S. 473, 484, 120 S.Ct. 1595, 146 L.Ed.2d 542 (2000); <em>Rose v. Lee, </em>252 F.3d 676, 683 (4th Cir.), <em>cert. denied, </em>534 U.S. 941, 122 S.Ct. 318, 151 L.Ed.2d 237 (2001).</p>\n<p id=\"b1014-4\">While we conclude that jurists of reason could debate the correctness of the district court\u2019s procedural finding that Quick\u2019s amended claims were time-barred under the AEDPA, we have independently reviewed the record and conclude that Quick has not demonstrated the denial of a constitutional right as to these amended claims. We further find that Quick has not made the requisite showing to obtain a certificate of appealability as to any of the claims raised in his initial \u00a7 2255 motion.</p>\n<p id=\"b1014-5\">Accordingly, we deny a certificate of appealability and dismiss the appeal. We dispense with oral argument because the facts and legal contentions are adequately presented in the materials before the court and argument would not aid the decisional process.</p>\n<p id=\"b1014-6\">\n<em>DISMISSED.</em>\n</p>\n</opinion>\n</casebody>\n",
