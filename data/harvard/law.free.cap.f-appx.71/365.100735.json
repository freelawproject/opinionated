The magistrate judge to whom the case was assigned was unable to determine</p>\n<p id=\"b403-21\">from the pleadings the basis for the court\u2019s jurisdiction or the nature of the claim, that is whether it was a contract suit, a tort suit or a worker\u2019s compensation suit. The magistrate judge directed Ms. Roberson to amend her petition to state with specificity the legal claims presented and the facts she relied on in support thereof. When the plaintiff did not respond, the magistrate judge recommended that the case be dismissed for two reasons: (1) the complaint did not demonstrate that the claim was within the court\u2019s jurisdiction and (2) the plaintiff failed to amend her complaint as directed by the court.</p>\n<p id=\"b403-22\">The district court adopted the magistrate judge\u2019s findings, accepted the magistrate judge\u2019s recommendations and dismissed the case without prejudice.</p>\n<p id=\"b403-23\">Unfortunately, Ms. Roberson, who filed this appeal <em>pro se, </em>addressed neither ground upon which the court dismissed her suit. Her brief is limited to a discussion of the facts surrounding her accident.</p>\n<p id=\"b403-24\">When an appellant fails to address the merits of an opinion or fails to identify any error, the practical effect \u201cis the same as if [she] had not appealed that judgment.\u201d <em>Brinkmann v. Dallas County, </em>813 F.2d 744, 748 (5th Cir.1987) Because the appellant failed to address the grounds for the district court\u2019s ruling, we consider her claims abandoned.<footnotemark>1</footnotemark></p>\n<p id=\"b403-25\">Appeal DISMISSED.</p>\n<footnote label=\"*\">\n<p id=\"b403-20\"> Pursuant to 5th Cir. R. 47.5, the Court has determined that this opinion should not be published and is not precedent except under the limited circumstances set forth in 5th Cir. R. 47.5.4.</p>\n</footnote>\n<footnote label=\"1\">\n<p id=\"b403-27\">. Roberson also filed a motion to add another party to this suit.
