He asserts that the district court erred in denying him a downward adjustment pursuant to the safety valve provision, U.S.S.G. \u00a7 5C1.2. Rodriguez has not met his burden of establishing that he provided truthful and complete information to the Government. <em>See </em>\u00a7 5C1.2(a)(5); <em>United States v. Flanagan, </em>80 F.3d 143, 146 (5th Cir.1996). He has not shown that the district court clearly erred in denying the adjustment. <em>See United States v. Miller, </em>179 F.3d 961, 963-64 (5th Cir.1999).</p>\n<p id=\"b416-19\">Rodriguez also asserts that the district court erred in denying him an adjustment for his minor role in the offense. Typically this court reviews such claims for clear error. <em>United States v. Gallegos, </em>868 F.2d 711, 713 (5th Cir.1989). However, because Rodriguez moved in the district court for an adjustment based upon his <em>minimal </em>role, this court should review for plain error. <em>See United States v. Leonard, </em>157 F.3d 343, 345 (5th Cir.1998). Regardless which standard we use, Rodriguez has not established that he was \u201csubstantially less culpable than the average participant.\u201d U.S.S.G. \u00a7 3B1.2, comment. (n.3(A)); <em>United States v. Lokey, </em>945 F.2d 825, 840 (5th Cir.1991). The judgment of the district court is therefore AFFIRMED.</p>\n<footnote label=\"*\">\n<p id=\"b416-16\"> Pursuant to 5th Cir. R. 47.5, the court has determined that this opinion should not be published and is not precedent except under the limited circumstances set forth in 5th Cir. R. 47.5.4.</p>\n</footnote>\n</opinion>\n</casebody>\n",
