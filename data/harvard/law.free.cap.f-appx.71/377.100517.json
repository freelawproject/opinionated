Fuller does not dispute that the search was based on probable cause, but he argues that the evidence should be suppressed because the warrant authorizing the search was not signed by a magistrate.</p>\n<p id=\"b415-18\">The evidence at the suppression hearing shows that the magistrate judge found probable cause to search Fuller\u2019s apartment; that he did not sign the warrant form due to an inadvertent error; and that the officer who searched Fuller\u2019s apartment believed that he had a valid warrant authorizing the search. Consequently, we AFFIRM the denial of Fuller\u2019s motion to suppress. <em>See United States v. Kelley, </em>140 F.3d 596, 601-04 (5th Cir.1998); <em>United States v. Shugart, </em>117 F.3d 838, 844 (5th Cir.1997).</p>\n<p id=\"b415-21\">AFFIRMED.</p>\n<footnote label=\"*\">\n<p id=\"b415-19\"> Pursuant to 5th Cir. R. 47.5, the court has determined that this opinion should not be published and is not precedent except under the limited circumstances set forth in 5th Cir. R. 47.5.4.</p>\n</footnote>\n</opinion>\n</casebody>\n",
