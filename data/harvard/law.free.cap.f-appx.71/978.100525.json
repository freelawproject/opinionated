Therefore, we affirm the district court\u2019s dismissal of her civil conspiracy claim.</p>\n<p id=\"b1016-24\">Grady asserts the dismissal of her retaliation claim was improper and that the district court converted the Department\u2019s motion to dismiss pursuant to Fed.R.Civ.P. 12(b)(6) to a motion for summary judgment by considering documents outside <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"979\">*979</page-number>the pleadings. Generally, if the district court is presented with materials outside the pleadings and does not exclude them, \u201cthe motion shall be treated as one for summary judgment ... and all parties shall be given reasonable opportunity to present all material made pertinent to such motion by Rule 56.\u201d Fed.R.Civ.P. 12(b); <em>see Gay v. Wall, </em>761 F.2d 175, 177-78 (4th Cir.1985).</p>\n<p id=\"b1017-5\">In ruling upon Grady\u2019s retaliation claim, the district court considered letters from the Department offering Grady positions within the Division of Motor Vehicles that the Department attached to its motion to dismiss. The district court specifically states that \u201cplaintiff had the option of returning to the Nash County office and refused,\u201d a conclusion apparently based upon the Department\u2019s Exhibit 8, which offered Grady the opportunity to \u201cremain in her current position\u201d with an adjusted pay and grade level. Based on our review of the record, we conclude the district court converted the motion to dismiss to a motion for summary judgment. Because the motion should have been treated as one for summary judgment, the court should have given the parties a reasonable opportunity to present all material made pertinent by Rule 56. <em>See Gay, </em>761 F.2d at 177.</p>\n<p id=\"b1017-6\">Accordingly, we vacate the portion of the district court\u2019s order dismissing Grady\u2019s retaliation claims under Rule 12(b)(6) and remand for further proceedings consistent with this opinion. We dispense with oral argument because the facts and legal contentions are adequately presented in the materials before the court and argument would not aid the decisional process.</p>\n<p id=\"b1017-7\">\n<em>AFFIRMED IN PART; VACATED IN PART AND REMANDED.</em>\n</p>\n</opinion>\n</casebody>\n",
