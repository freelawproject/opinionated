During the investigation leading to Quinones\u2019 arrest, more than $500,000 was seized from Quinones\u2019 vehicle and his <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"320\">*320</page-number>home. The district court\u2019s determination that the cash was proceeds of jointly undertaken criminal activity is supported by Quinones\u2019 plea agreement, in which he stipulated that the money was proceeds of drug trafficking. Therefore, the district court did not clearly err when it used the seized cash to approximate drug quantity. <em>See </em>U.S.S.G. \u00a7 2D1.1, comment, (n.12); <em>United States v. Johnston, </em>127 F.3d 380, 403 (5th Cir.1997).</p>\n<p id=\"b358-4\">Quinones also challenges the district court\u2019s application of U.S.S.G. \u00a7 2Dl.l(b)(l) by arguing that the fact that five firearms were found in his master bedroom does not warrant the weapons enhancement. He fails to argue that the weapons were not connected with the offense. The record supports the district court\u2019s decision, since undisputed facts establish that five firearms were found in Quinones\u2019 residence along with proceeds of drug trafficking, scales, and drugs. Therefore, the district court did not commit clear error when it applied U.S.S.G. \u00a7 2D1.1. <em>See United States v. Mergerson, </em>4 F.3d 337, 350 (5th Cir.1993).</p>\n<p id=\"b358-5\">Quinones also argues that the district court erroneously determined that he committed perjury and therefore erred when it increased his sentence pursuant to U.S.S.G. \u00a7 3C1.1, the obstruction of justice guideline, and denied him an adjustment for acceptance of responsibility pursuant to U.S.S.G. \u00a7 3E1.1. Although the district court made repeated findings on these issues during the sentencing hearing, Quinones failed to object and failed to present the arguments that he now presents to this court. Therefore, these issues are reviewed for plain error only. <em>See United States v. Ocana, </em>204 F.3d 585, 588-89 (5th Cir.2000). Additionally, Quinones argues for the first time in his reply brief that a perjury determination may only be made when the perjury is corroborated by two witnesses. Arguments may not be raised for the first time in a reply brief, and therefore this argument is not considered. <em>See United States v. Jackson, </em>50 F.3d 1335, 1340 n. 7 (5th Cir.1995).</p>\n<p id=\"b358-7\">Based on the considerable uncontested evidence contained in the presentence report and elsewhere in the record regarding Quinones\u2019 active participation in the conspiracy, and giving the deference due to the district court\u2019s credibility findings, <em>see United States v. Sotelo, </em>97 F.3d 782, 789 (5th Cir.1996), the determination that Quinones committed perjury during his sentencing hearing when he disavowed knowledge of the cash and weapons that were stashed in his home is not error, plain or otherwise. Moreover, the district court\u2019s finding that Quinones intentionally provided false testimony on a material issue with the intent to persuade the court to lower his sentence provided the requisite elements of a perjury determination and therefore warranted application of the obstruction of justice guideline. <em>See United States v. Cabral-Castillo, </em>35 F.3d 182, 186 (5th Cir.1994) (the district court\u2019s finding is sufficient if it encompasses the factual predicates for perjury).</p>\n<p id=\"b358-8\">Quinones also contests the district court\u2019s decision not to apply U.S.S.G. \u00a7 3E1.1, which provides for an offense level reduction if a defendant \u201cclearly demonstrates a recognition and affirmative acceptance of personal responsibility for his criminal conduct.\u201d Conduct resulting in an enhancement for obstructing justice ordinarily indicates that a defendant has not accepted responsibility for his criminal conduct, although both adjustments may apply in \u201cextraordinary\u201d cases. U.S.S.G. \u00a7 3E1.1, comment, (n.4). The district court\u2019s conclusion that Quinones did not fully accept responsibility for his crime because he lied about possessing cash and weapons, when in fact he did possess cash <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"321\">*321</page-number>and weapons, is not error, plain or otherwise. <em>See United States v. Lugo-Abundis, </em>897 F.2d 171, 172 (5th Cir.1990) (affirming refusal to grant acceptance of responsibility adjustment when sentencing defendant for marijuana offense when defendant denied knowledge of the presence of drugs).</p>\n<p id=\"b359-5\">The district court\u2019s judgment is therefore AFFIRMED.</p>\n<footnote label=\"1\">\n<p id=\"b357-16\">. Pursuant to 5th Cir. R. 47.5, the court has determined that this opinion should not be published and is not precedent except under the limited circumstances set forth in 5th Cir. R. 47.5.4.</p>\n</footnote>\n</opinion>\n</casebody>\n",
