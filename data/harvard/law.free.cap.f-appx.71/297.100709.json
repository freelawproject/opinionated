Fed. R. Civ. P. 12(b)(1), (6). Pajooh challenges the district court\u2019s dismissal of his claims against the district court judge, the judges of this court, the Assistant United States Attorney, and his retained counsel. He also argues that the district court should have granted declaratory relief and should have released him on bond pending the <em>Bivens </em>action.</p>\n<p id=\"b336-3\"><page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"298\">*298</page-number>Pajooh does not brief the issue of the district court\u2019s dismissal of his claims against the district court case manager as barred by absolute immunity; the issue of the dismissal of his claims against the Department of Justice and the federal courts; or the issue of the dismissal of his conspiracy claims. Those claims are abandoned. <em>See Yohey v. Collins, </em>985 F.2d 222, 224-25 (5th Cir.1993); Fed. R.App. P. 28(a)(9). Pajooh has also abandoned the issue of the court\u2019s dismissal of his claims for damages as barred by <em>Heck v. Humphrey, </em>512 U.S. 477, 114 S.Ct. 2364, 129 L.Ed.2d 383 (1994).</p>\n<p id=\"b336-4\">The district court did not err in dismissing Pajooh\u2019s claims against the district court judge, the judges of this court, and the Assistant United States Attorney as barred by absolute immunity. <em>See Mays v. Sudderth, </em>97 F.3d 107, 110-11 (5th Cir. 1996); <em>Boyd v. Biggers, </em>31 F.3d 279, 284-85 (5th Cir.1994). Pursuant to <em>Heck, </em>512 U.S. 477, 114 S.Ct. 2364, 129 L.Ed.2d 383 (1994), Pajooh\u2019s claims against retained counsel Kuniansky have not accrued. <em>Stephenson v. Reno, </em>28 F.3d 26, 27-28 (5th Cir.1994). Moreover, retained trial counsel was not acting under color of state law. <em>See Mills v. Criminal Disk Court No. 3, </em>837 F.2d 677, 679 (5th Cir.1988).</p>\n<p id=\"b336-5\">Declaratory relief is not available to attack a federal as the improper result of a violation of civil rights. <em>See Johnson v. Onion, </em>761 F.2d 224, 225-26 (5th Cir.1985). The issue of Pajooh\u2019s release pending the <em>Bivens </em>action is moot. Pajooh\u2019s motion for a change of venue is DENIED.</p>\n<p id=\"b336-6\">AFFIRMED.</p>\n<footnote label=\"*\">\n<p id=\"b335-13\"> Pursuant to 5th Cir.
