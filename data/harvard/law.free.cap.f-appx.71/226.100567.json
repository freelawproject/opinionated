White argues on appeal that the district court erred in failing to order a competency <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"227\">*227</page-number>hearing sua sponte, pursuant to 18 U.S.C. \u00a7 4241(a) (2000), and that the court erred in failing to grant a mistrial based on the prosecution\u2019s closing argument. We find these contentions to be without merit, and we affirm White\u2019s conviction and sentence.</p>\n<p id=\"b265-5\">After the jury returned a verdict of guilty on the conspiracy charge, the magistrate judge held a status conference, during which White\u2019s counsel requested a competency examination pursuant to 18 U.S.C. \u00a7\u00a7 4241, 4242 (2000). The magistrate judge granted the motion. The examiners concluded White was competent at the time of his trial, and after additional time, also concluded White was ready and competent to return to court for sentencing. The Federal Bureau of Prisons issued a certificate of restoration of competency to stand trial on June 24, 2002, and White was sentenced on August 19, 2002.</p>\n<p id=\"b265-6\">Based on this sequence of events, we conclude the district court committed no error when it did not sua sponte order a competency hearing for White. Based on the expert opinions before it, the court did not have \u201creasonable cause to believe that [White was] suffering from a mental disease or defect rendering him mentally incompetent to the extent that he [was] unable to understand the nature and consequences of the proceedings against him or to assist properly in his defense.\u201d 18 U.S.C. \u00a7 4241(a).</p>\n<p id=\"b265-7\">White\u2019s contention that the Government\u2019s closing argument impermissibly interfered with his Fifth Amendment rights also fails. The prosecutor stated in closing argument: \u201cThere is nothing reasonable about acquitting Robert White. There is nothing reasonable about any explanation, and there\u2019s been none offered, for his innocence.\u201d The district court found that the comment was directed towards the defense counsel\u2019s failure in closing argument to present a convincing theory for White\u2019s innocence, and so instructed the jury.</p>\n<p id=\"b265-8\">There is no indication that the Government was arguing that the jury should infer guilt because White did not testify in his own defense. Furthermore, the Government and the trial court explained that the burden rested on the prosecution to prove guilt beyond a reasonable doubt. The court further instructed the jury that the defense had no burden to offer any explanation, proof, or witnesses at trial. We conclude these curative instructions were sufficient to clear up any possible ambiguity in the prosecutor\u2019s statement. Therefore, the district court did not abuse its discretion in denying the motion for a mistrial. <em>United States v. Dorlouis, </em>107 F.3d 248, 257 (4th Cir.1997).</p>\n<p id=\"b265-9\">We thus affirm White\u2019s conviction and sentence. We dispense with oral argument because the facts and legal contentions have been adequately presented in the materials before the court and argument would not aid the decisional process.</p>\n<p id=\"b265-10\">\n<em>AFFIRMED.</em>\n</p>\n</opinion>\n</casebody>\n",
