Morris appeals, claiming that the district court erred in finding that he used the firearm in connection with another felony offense and thus enhancing his sentence by four levels under <em>U.S. Sentencing Guidelines Manual </em>\u00a7 2K2.1(b)(5) (2000). At Morris\u2019 sentencing hearing, the Government presented testimony establishing that, on December 10, 1999, Morris shot and seriously wounded Tyrone Scott. At the conclusion of the hearing, the court specifically found that Morris\u2019 shooting of Scott was not done in self-defense.</p>\n<p id=\"b1015-12\">To apply the enhancement under \u00a7 2K2.1(b)(5), the Government must prove by a preponderance of the evidence facts that establish that the defendant used a firearm and that such use was in connection with another felony offense. The district court\u2019s findings of fact are reviewed for clear error. <em>United States v. Garnett, </em>243 F.3d 824, 828-29 (4th Cir.2001); <em>see also United States v. Nale, </em>101 F.3d 1000, 1004 <em>&amp; </em>n. 3 (4th Cir.1996).</p>\n<p id=\"b1015-13\">Morris claims that the district court erred in assigning the four-level enhancement because he presented evidence sufficient to support his claim that he acted in self-defense. However, after hearing testimony from a number of witnesses to the shooting, the district court specifically found no believable evidence that Morris was defending himself at the time he shot Scott or that Scott was armed at the time Morris shot him. Morris cannot show that this conclusion was clearly erroneous.</p>\n<p id=\"b1015-14\">Morris also argues that no separate felony occurred because there were no state charges filed against him as a result of the shooting.</p>\n<p id=\"b1015-15\">However, Application Note 7 to \u00a7 2K2.1 provides that a felony offense, \u201cas used in subsection (b)(5), means any offense (federal, state, or local) punishable by imprisonment for a term exceeding one year, whether or not a criminal charge was brought, or conviction obtained.\u201d Morris\u2019 conduct (assault with a deadly weapon with intent to kill) clearly constitutes a felony for purposes of \u00a7 2K2.1(b)(5).</p>\n<p id=\"b1015-16\">Accordingly, we affirm Morris\u2019 sentence. We dispense with oral argument because the facts and legal contentions are adequately presented in the materials before the court and argument would not aid the decisional process.</p>\n<p id=\"b1015-17\">\n<em>AFFIRMED.</em>\n</p>\n</opinion>\n</casebody>\n",
