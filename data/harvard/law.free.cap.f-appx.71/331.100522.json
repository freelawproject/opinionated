Soliz challenges his state habeas corpus proceedings and his transfer to the state prison system following revocation of his parole. Soliz moves to supplement the record; his motion is DENIED.</p>\n<p id=\"b370-15\">Soliz contends that he was deprived of access to the courts by the actions of the state trial court during state habeas corpus proceedings. Defects in state habeas corpus procedures \u201cdo not constitute grounds for relief in federal court.\u201d <em>Trevino v. Johnson, </em>168 F.3d 173, 180 (5th Cir.1999).</p>\n<p id=\"b370-16\">Soliz contends that he was deprived of his right of access to trial counsel and of his right to communicate with the outside world by being transferred to the custody of the state prison system. Soliz had no constitutionally protected right to incarceration in any particular facility. <em>See Olim v. Wakinekona, </em>461 U.S. 238, 244-45, 103 S.Ct. 1741, 75 L.Ed.2d 813 (1983).</p>\n<p id=\"b370-17\">Soliz contends that the district court erred by failing to make any findings regarding his claim that defense counsel and the prosecutor conspired to prosecute him maliciously. Soliz states that his civil rights were violated by the two defendants, but does not allege facts or argue law to support that proposition. Soliz has failed to brief the issue for appeal. <em>Brinkmann v. Dallas County Deputy Sheriff Abner, </em>813 F.2d 744, 748 (5th Cir.1987).</p>\n<p id=\"b370-18\">Soliz\u2019s appeal is without arguable merit and is frivolous. <em>Howard v. King, </em>707 F.2d 215, 219-20 (5th Cir.1983). Soliz is warned that the dismissal of his complaint counts as a strike for purposes of 28 U.S.C. \u00a7 1915(g) and that the dismissal of his appeal counts as a second strike. <em>Ade</em><page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"333\">*333</page-number><em>pegba v. Hammons, </em>103 F.3d 383, 387-88 (5th Cir.1996). When Soliz accumulates three strikes he will not be allowed to bring a civil action or appeal a judgment in forma pauperis unless he is \u201cunder imminent danger of serious physical injury.\u201d 28 U.S.C. \u00a7 1915(g).</p>\n<p id=\"b371-5\">APPEAL DISMISSED. 5th C\u00ede. R. 42.2.</p>\n<footnote label=\"*\">\n<p id=\"b370-13\"> Pursuant to 5th Cir. R. 47.5, the court has determined that this opinion should not be published and is not precedent except under the limited circumstances set forth in 5th Cir.
