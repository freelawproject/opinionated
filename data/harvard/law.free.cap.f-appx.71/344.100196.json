Johnson appeals, <em>pro se, </em>the affirmance of the Social Security Commissioner\u2019s decision to terminate her disability insurance benefits and supplemental social security income. The Commissioner determined that, post-surgery Johnson had undergone medical improvement. <em>See </em>42 U.S.C. \u00a7 423(f). Johnson contends this determination was not based upon substantial evidence. (Johnson also claims the Administrative Law Judge was not presented with a complete copy of her medical records. We decline to consider this claim because it is raised for the first time on appeal. <em>See Leverette v. Louisville Ladder Co., </em>183 F.3d 339, 342 (5th Cir.1999), <em>cert. denied, </em>528 U.S. 1138, 120 S.Ct. 982, 145 L.Ed.2d 932 (2000).)</p>\n<p id=\"b383-4\"><page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"345\">*345</page-number>Our review of the Commissioner\u2019s decision \u201cis limited to determining whether that decision is supported by substantial evidence and whether the proper legal standards were applied\u201d. <em>Ripley v. Chater, </em>67 F.3d 552, 555 (5th Cir.1995). \u201cSubstantial evidence is more than a scintilla, less than a preponderance, and is such relevant evidence as a reasonable mind might accept as adequate to support a conclusion.\u201d <em>Martinez v. Chater, </em>64 F.3d 172, 173 (5th Cir.1995) (internal quotations and citations omitted).</p>\n<p id=\"b383-5\">Johnson\u2019s contentions are unavailing. There was substantial evidence to support the Commissioner\u2019s medical improvement decision.</p>\n<p id=\"b383-6\">\n<em>AFFIRMED</em>\n</p>\n<footnote label=\"*\">\n<p id=\"b382-32\"> Pursuant to 5th Cir.
