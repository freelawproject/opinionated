While Hollister was attending TISD schools, he participated in extra curricular activity. In the fall of 1996, TISD\u2019s board of trustees approved the development of a suspicionless, random student drug testing program for students involved in school-sponsored extra-curricular activities. The drug-testing program was implemented in January 1997.</p>\n<p id=\"b353-12\">Hollister appeals the district court\u2019s denial of declaratory and injunctive relief from implementation of TISD's drug testing. Hollister fails to brief any claim he has for money damages stemming from the alleged unconstitutional policy, and he has waived any issue on appeal in that regard. <em>Yohey v. Collins, </em>985 F.2d 222, 224-25 (5th Cir.1993). Because Hollister has graduated from high school, the instant appeal from the district court\u2019s denial of declaratory and injunctive relief is moot. <em>Bd. of Sch. Comm\u2019rs of Indianapolis v. Jacobs, </em>420 U.S. 128, 129, 95 S.Ct. 848, 43 L.Ed.2d 74 (1975) (per curiam); <em>McClelland v. Gronwaldt, </em>155 F.3d 507, 514 (5th Cir.1998). Hollister\u2019s appeal is, therefore, DISMISSED.</p>\n<p id=\"b353-15\">The court notes that Hollister\u2019s appellate brief contained expletives and discussion bordering on profane to support his argument that teenagers are easily embarrassed by urinalysis drug testing. Hollister is WARNED that this court will not tolerate such language in any future filings by Hollister.</p>\n<p id=\"b353-16\">TISD\u2019s motion to file a supplemental brief is DENIED as unnecessary.</p>\n<footnote label=\"*\">\n<p id=\"b353-13\"> Pursuant to 5th Cir. R. 47.5, the court has determined that this opinion should not be published and is not precedent except under the limited circumstances set forth in 5th Cir. R. 47.5.4.</p>\n</footnote>\n</opinion>\n</casebody>\n",
