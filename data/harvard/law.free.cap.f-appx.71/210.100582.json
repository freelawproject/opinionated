Having reviewed Bar-field\u2019s claims, we affirm.</p>\n<p id=\"b249-15\">Barfield first claims that the district court erred in departing upward from the applicable sentencing guidelines range. Our review of the record discloses that the upward departure was justified on several grounds. Barfield\u2019s criminal activity resulted in \u201creasonably foreseeable, substantial non-monetary harm\u201d to her former employer. <em>U.S. Sentencing Guidelines Manual </em>\u00a7 2F1.1, comment. (n.11(a)) (2000). It also facilitated the continued distribution of cocaine to Barfield\u2019s son. <em>See </em>USSG \u00a7 2F1.1, comment. (n.11(b)). Accordingly, we find that the district court did not err in upwardly departing from the applicable sentencing guideline range.<footnotemark>*</footnotemark></p>\n<p id=\"b249-16\">Barfield also claims that the district court erred by failing to notify her of each potential ground warranting an upward departure. Because this claim was not raised below, we review for plain error. <em>See United States v. Olano, </em>507 U.S. 725, 732-34, 113 S.Ct. 1770, 123 L.Ed.2d 508 (1993). Barfield was notified of the possibility of an upward departure both by the presentence investigation report and by the district court when it declined to accept the plea agreement. Furthermore, our review of the record does not disclose any evidence that the district court\u2019s consideration of several factors to support an upward departure amounted to error, much less error that \u201c\u2018seriously affect[s] the fairness, integrity or public reputation of judicial proceedings.\u2019 \u201d <em>Id. </em>at 736 (quoting <em>United States v. Atkinson, </em>297 U.S. <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"212\">*212</page-number>157, 160, 56 S.Ct. 391, 80 L.Ed. 555 (1936)). Accordingly, we deny this claim.</p>\n<p id=\"b250-4\">We affirm the judgment of the district court. We dispense with oral argument because the facts and legal contentions are adequately presented in the materials before the court and argument would not aid the decisional process.</p>\n<p id=\"b250-5\">\n<em>AFFIRMED.</em>\n</p>\n<footnote label=\"*\">\n<p id=\"b249-13\"> We note that, while Carter's appeal was pending, Congress enacted legislation changing the standard of review applicable to departure decisions under the sentencing guidelines. <em>See </em>Prosecutorial Remedies and Tools Against the Exploitation of Children Today Act of 2003 (\"PROTECT Act\u201d), Pub. L. No. 108-21, \u00a7 401(d), 117 Stat. 650, 670. We need not decide whether the provisions of the PROTECT Act apply to Carter\u2019s case because we would affirm under the new standard of review or the more deferential standard applicable before the Act.</p>\n</footnote>\n</opinion>\n</casebody>\n",
