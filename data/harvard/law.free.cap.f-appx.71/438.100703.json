Contreras\u2019 guilty-plea to the 8 U.S.C. \u00a7 1326(a) charge was taken by the magistrate judge and approved by the district court after Contreras gave his written consent. Contreras argues that his guilty plea and conviction are void because a Fed. R.Crim. P. 11 colloquy may never be delegated to a non-Article III magistrate judge. He concedes that this argument is foreclosed by circuit precedent but raises it to preserve the issue for Supreme Court review.</p>\n<p id=\"b477-7\">We held in <em>United States v. Dees, </em>125 F.3d 261, 266-69 (5th Cir.1997), that 28 U.S.C. \u00a7 636(b)(3) provides a magistrate judge with the statutory authority to conduct a Fed. R.Crim. P. 11 guilty plea proceeding and that this delegation of authority does not violate the Constitution. Therefore, Contreras\u2019 argument is foreclosed, and the judgments of the district court are AFFIRMED.</p>\n<p id=\"b477-8\">The Government\u2019s unopposed motion for summary affirmance and to waive the briefing requirement is GRANTED. The Government\u2019s request to extend the briefing period is DENIED as unnecessary.</p>\n<footnote label=\"*\">\n<p id=\"b477-6\"> Pursuant to 5th Cir. R. 47.5, the court has determined that this opinion should not be published and is not precedent except under the limited circumstances set forth in 5th Cir. R. 47.5.4.</p>\n</footnote>\n</opinion>\n</casebody>\n",
