California, </em>386 U.S. 738, 87 S.Ct. 1396,18 L.Ed.2d 493 (1967). Patt has received a copy of counsel\u2019s motion and has filed a letter in response. Our independent review of the brief and the record discloses no nonfrivolous issues for appeal. Counsel\u2019s motion for leave to withdraw is granted, counsel is excused from further responsibilities, and the appeal is dismissed.</p>\n<p id=\"b438-22\">MOTION TO WITHDRAW GRANTED; APPEAL DISMISSED.</p>\n<footnote label=\"*\">\n<p id=\"b438-20\"> Pursuant to 5th Cir.
