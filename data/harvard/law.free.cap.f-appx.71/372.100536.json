Hoffman argues that the district court abused its discretion in denying his motion for a new trial on the ground of juror misconduct.</p>\n<p id=\"b411-7\">In support of his motion, Hoffman attached the affidavit of a juror, Jan Dobrin, in which Dobrin stated that after the jury had been sworn and before evidence was taken, another juror stated, \u201c[w]here there\u2019s smoke, there\u2019s fire,\u201d and \u201c[T]he police don\u2019t arrest you for nothing.\u201d Dobrin\u2019s affidavit, however, is inadmissible pursuant to Federal Rule of Evidence 606(b). <em>See United States v. Ortiz, </em>942 F.2d 903, 913 (5th Cir.1991). We also conclude that the district court did not abuse its discretion in declining to investigate the allegations of juror misconduct and in denying Hoffman\u2019s motion for a new trial. <em>See United States v. Rivera, </em>295 F.3d 461, 470 (5th Cir.2002); <em>Grooms v. Wainwright, </em>610 F.2d 344, 347 (5th Cir. 1980).</p>\n<p id=\"b411-8\">Moreover, to the extent that Hoffman argues that the district court should have entertained evidence concerning, or further investigated the possibility of, juror bias based on Dobrin\u2019s affidavit, that argument is also without merit. \u201cThe proper time to discover such [juror prejudice] is when the jury is being selected and peremptory challenges are available to the attorneys.\u201d <em>United States v. Duzac, </em>622 F.2d 911, 913 (5th Cir.1980). A jury\u2019s \u201cverdict may not be disturbed if it is later learned that personal prejudices were not put aside during deliberations.\u201d <em>Id. </em>Moreover, even where jurors may have made \u201cpremature expressions as to guilt, we generally defer to the district court\u2019s decision as to whether the defendant received a fair trial by an impartial jury.\u201d <em>United States v. Collins, </em>972 F.2d 1385, 1404 (5th Cir.1992).</p>\n<p id=\"b411-11\">For the foregoing reasons, the judgment of the district court is</p>\n<p id=\"b411-12\">AFFIRMED.</p>\n<footnote label=\"*\">\n<p id=\"b411-9\"> Pursuant to 5th Cir. R. 47.5 the Court has determined that this opinion should not be published and is not precedent except under the limited circumstances set forth in 5th Cir. R. 47.5.4.</p>\n</footnote>\n</opinion>\n</casebody>\n",
