Farquhar (\u201cFarquhar\u201d), federal prisoner number 28074-077, appeals the district court\u2019s order denying and dismissing with prejudice his application for writ of habeas corpus. Because he challenges his conviction and not the manner in which his sentence is being executed, Farquhar must satisfy the requirements for filing a 28 U.S.C. \u00a7 2241 petition under 28 U.S.C. \u00a7 2255\u2019s \u201csavings clause.\u201d <em>See Pack v. Yusuff, </em>218 F.3d 448, 448 (5th Cir.2000).</p>\n<p id=\"b417-35\">Farquhar has not met his burden of showing that he meets the requirements for filing a \u00a7 2241 petition under the savings clause of \u00a7 2255. Farquhar must point to a retroactively applicable Supreme <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"380\">*380</page-number>Court decision which establishes that he may have been imprisoned for conduct that was not prohibited by law and show that his claims were foreclosed by circuit law at the time of his guilty-plea conviction, appeal, or first \u00a7 2255 motion. <em>See Reyes-Requena v. United States, </em>243 F.3d 893, 903-04 (5th Cir.2001). Farquhar\u2019s arguments do not satisfy both of the above requirements.</p>\n<p id=\"b418-4\">AFFIRMED. All outstanding motions are DENIED.</p>\n<footnote label=\"*\">\n<p id=\"b417-36\"> Pursuant to 5th Cir R. 47.5, the court has determined that this opinion should not be published and is not precedent except under the limited circumstances set forth in 5th Cir.
