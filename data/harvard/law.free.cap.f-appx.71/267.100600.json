Parker, Jr., seeks to appeal the district court\u2019s order accepting the magistrate judge\u2019s recommendation to dismiss his civil complaint. We dismiss the appeal for lack of jurisdiction because the notice of appeal was not timely filed.</p>\n<p id=\"b305-25\">Parties are accorded thirty days after the entry of the district court\u2019s final judgment or order to note an appeal, Fed. R.App. P. 4(a)(1)(A), unless the district court extends the appeal period under Fed. R.App. P. 4(a)(5) or reopens the appeal period under Fed. R.App. P. 4(a)(6). This appeal period is \u201cmandatory and jurisdictional.\u201d <em>Browder v. Director, Dep\u2019t of Corr., </em>434 U.S. 257, 264, 98 S.Ct. 556, 54 L.Ed.2d 521 (1978) (quoting <em>United States v.

The notice of appeal was filed on February 19, <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"268\">*268</page-number>2003.<footnotemark>*</footnotemark> Because Parker failed to file a timely notice of appeal or to obtain an extension or reopening of the appeal period, we dismiss the appeal. We dispense with oral argument because the facts and legal contentions are adequately presented in the materials before the court and argument would not aid the decisional process.</p>\n<p id=\"b306-4\">\n<em>DISMISSED.</em>\n</p>\n<footnote label=\"*\">\n<p id=\"b306-17\"> Parker mistakenly filed his notice of appeal with this court on February 19, 2003. This court forwarded the notice of appeal to the district court for filing. The notice of appeal was thus filed in the district court on Februaiy 21, 2003. In accordance with Fed. R.App. P. 4(d), Parker\u2019s notice of appeal is deemed filed on February 19, 2003, the date the notice of appeal was received by this court and sent to the district court.</p>\n</footnote>\n</opinion>\n</casebody>\n",
