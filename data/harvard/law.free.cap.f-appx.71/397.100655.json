Kunji argues that the evidence was sufficient to support a finding of past persecution and a well-founded fear of persecution based on his association with the Muslim League.</p>\n<p id=\"b435-22\">When, as in this case, the BIA adopts without opinion the IJ\u2019s decision, this court reviews the IJ\u2019s decision. <em>Mikhael v. I.N.S., </em>115 F.3d 299, 302 (5th Cir.1997). Here, the IJ\u2019s determination that Kunji had not shown past persecution or a well-founded fear of future persecution if returned to India was supported by substantial evidence. <em>See Ontunez-Tursios v. Ashcroft, </em>303 F.3d 341, 350 (5th Cir.2002); <em>Gomez-Mejia v. I.N.S., </em>56 F.3d 700, 702 (5th Cir.1995).</p>\n<p id=\"b435-23\">Kunji\u2019s petition for review is DENIED.</p>\n<footnote label=\"*\">\n<p id=\"b435-20\"> Pursuant to 5th Cir. R. 47.5, the court has determined that this opinion should not be published and is not precedent except under the limited circumstances set forth in 5th Cir. R. 47.5.4.</p>\n</footnote>\n</opinion>\n</casebody>\n",
