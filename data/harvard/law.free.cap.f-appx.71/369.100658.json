Keele filed a 42 U.S.C. \u00a7 1983 civil rights complaint against Guajardo alleging that Guajardo informed another inmate of Keele\u2019s incarceration crimes and unlocked Keele\u2019s cell door in order for the inmate to assault Keele.</p>\n<p id=\"b407-25\">This court reviews a grant of summary judgment <em>de novo. See Olabisiomotosho v. City of Houston, </em>185 F.3d 521, 525 (5th Cir.1999). The facts and any inferences to be drawn are viewed in the light most favorable to the nonmovant. <em>Id. </em>\"Summary judgment is properly granted if \u2018the pleadings, depositions, answers to interrogatories, and admissions on file, together with the affidavits, if any, show that there <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"370\">*370</page-number>is no genuine issue as to any material fact and that the moving party is entitled to judgment as a matter of law.\u2019 \u201d <em>Id.; </em>Fed. R. Civ. P. 56(c).</p>\n<p id=\"b408-4\">It is unclear in the record whether Keele was a pretrial detainee or a convicted prisoner at the time of the alleged constitutional violation in the instant case. However, as in this case, when a claim is based on the \u201cepisodic acts or omissions\u201d of jail officials, the standard of subjective deliberate indifference is applicable. <em>See Hare v. City of Corinth, </em>74 F.3d 633, 643, 650 (5th Cir.1996) (en banc).</p>\n<p id=\"b408-5\">\n<em>Official capacity</em>\n</p>\n<p id=\"b408-6\">Keele\u2019s claim against Guajardo in his official capacity is treated as a claim against Bexar County. <em>Brooks v. George County, Miss., </em>77 F.3d 834, 841 (5th Cir.), withdrawn and superceded on other grounds, 84 F.3d 157 (5th Cir.1996). A governmental entity can be held hable under \u00a7 1983 only if official policy or custom caused the deprivation of a constitutional right. <em>Monell v. Dep\u2019t of Soc. Servs., </em>436 U.S. 658, 694, 98 S.Ct. 2018, 56 L.Ed.2d 611 (1978).</p>\n<p id=\"b408-7\">Keele has failed to establish that it was the policy or custom of the BCADC to incite inmate assaults. At best, Keele alleges an isolated incident, not a widespread custom of the BCADC to support his claim of official liability. <em>See Fields v. City of Houston, </em>922 F.2d 1183, 1191-92 (5th Cir.1991). Accordingly, the district court\u2019s grant of summary judgment for Guajardo in his official capacity is affirmed.</p>\n<p id=\"b408-8\">\n<em>Individual capacity</em>\n</p>\n<p id=\"b408-9\">The district court characterized the nature of Keele\u2019s complaint as a failure-to-protect from another inmate claim. However, the allegations contained in Keele\u2019s complaint and appellate brief fairly raise a more direct claim of cruel and unusual punishment at the hands of Guajardo which we address herein.</p>\n<p id=\"b408-11\">The first inquiry in examining a defense of qualified immunity asserted in a motion for summary judgment is to determine whether the plaintiff has alleged \u201cthe violation of a clearly established constitutional right.\u201d <em>Siegert v. Gilley, </em>500 U.S. 226, 231, 111 S.Ct. 1789, 114 L.Ed.2d 277 (1991). The second step is to decide whether the defendant\u2019s conduct was objectively reasonable in light of the legal rules clearly established at the time of the incident. <em>Spann v. Rainey, </em>987 F.2d 1110, 1114 (5th Cir.1993). Because Keele has alleged episodic acts and omissions committed by Guajardo rather than a widespread custom at the BCADC, his claim falls under the deliberate indifference standard regardless of his incarceration status. <em>See Hare, </em>74 F.3d at 643, 650. A showing of deliberate indifference requires that the official have a subjective knowledge of the risk of harm. <em>Wagner v. Bay City, Tex., </em>227 F.3d 316, 324 (5th Cir. 2000).</p>\n<p id=\"b408-12\">Keele\u2019s allegations raise a genuine issue of material fact over whether Guajardo\u2019s actions constituted cruel and unusual punishment. Keele\u2019s detailed account of the incident in his complaint as well as a supporting affidavit from another inmate raise a material fact issue over whether Guajardo himself deliberately subjected Keele to cruel and unusual punishment. Guajardo\u2019s summary judgment evidence in the form of an incident report indicating that he believed there was a \u201cpossibility\u201d that one of the cell doors left unsecured by the lunch relief officer was Keele\u2019s does not directly refute Keele\u2019s sworn assertions in his complaint regarding Guajardo\u2019s involvement. Accordingly, the district court erred in granting summary judgment for Guajardo in his individual capad<page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"371\">*371</page-number>ty. The judgment of the district court is AFFIRMED IN PART AND VACATED AND REMANDED IN PART.</p>\n<footnote label=\"*\">\n<p id=\"b407-18\"> Pursuant to 5th Cir. R. 47.5, the court has determined that this opinion should not be published and is not precedent except under the limited circumstances set forth in 5th Cir.
