Boone\u2019s counsel contends the district court made two evidentiary errors. Specifically, counsel claims the district court erred by (1) admitting evidence of his \u201cswinger\u201d lifestyle, and (2) admitting statements made by the murder victim. Boone has filed a motion to file a pro se supplemental brief, which we grant.</p>\n<p id=\"b266-16\">A district court\u2019s rulings on the admission and exclusion of evidence will not be disturbed absent an abuse of discretion. <em>United States v. Bostian, </em>59 F.3d 474, 480 (4th Cir.1995). We will find an abuse of discretion only if the district court\u2019s evidentiary ruling was arbitrary or irrational. <em>United States v. Achiekwelu, </em>112 F.3d 747, 753 (4th Cir.1997). Evidentiary rulings are also subject to review for harmless error under Federal Rule of Criminal Procedure 52, and will be found harmless if <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"229\">*229</page-number>the reviewing court can conclude \u201cwithout stripping the erroneous action from the whole, that the judgment was not substantially swayed by the error.\u201d <em>United States v. Nyman, </em>649 F.2d 208, 211-12 (4th Cir. 1980) (quoting <em>Kotteakos v. United States, </em>328 U.S. 750, 765, 66 S.Ct. 1239, 90 L.Ed. 1557 (1946)).</p>\n<p id=\"b267-5\">With regard to evidence of Boone\u2019s lifestyle, we find the district court did not abuse its discretion. With regard to the decision to admit the victim\u2019s statements, we find any error harmless. Given the substantial evidence supporting the conviction for bombing, we find the judgment was not substantially swayed by the error.</p>\n<p id=\"b267-6\">While we grant Boone\u2019s motion to file a pro se supplemental brief, we find the issues raised in the brief are without merit.</p>\n<p id=\"b267-7\">Accordingly, we affirm the convictions and sentence. We grant Boone\u2019s motion to file a pro se supplemental brief. We deny his motion for a hearing en banc. We dispense with oral argument because the facts and legal contentions are adequately presented in the materials before the court and argument would not aid the decisional process.</p>\n<p id=\"b267-8\">\n<em>AFFIRMED.</em>\n</p>\n</opinion>\n</casebody>\n",
