This court reviews a grant of summary judgment <em>de novo, </em>using the same standard applicable in the district court. <em>See Melton v. Teachers Ins. &amp; Annuity Ass\u2019n of America, </em>114 F.3d 557, 559 (5th Cir.1997).</p>\n<p id=\"b412-13\">Sephus argues that the magistrate judge failed to consider his submitted exhibits and that those exhibits presented a genuine issue as to whether the defendants were deliberately indifferent to his medical needs. Examination of the magistrate judge\u2019s judgment clearly indicates that Sephus\u2019s exhibits were considered and that no genuine issue as to any material fact existed regarding Sephus\u2019s claims. <em>See </em>Fed. R. Civ. P. 56(c). At most, the evidence in the record alleged negligence by the defendants, which is not actionable. <em>See Varnado v. Lynaugh, </em>920 F.2d 320, 321 (5th Cir.1991).</p>\n<p id=\"b412-15\">Accordingly, the magistrate judge\u2019s judgment is AFFIRMED. All outstanding motions are DENIED.</p>\n<p id=\"b412-16\">AFFIRMED; OUTSTANDING MOTIONS DENIED.</p>\n<footnote label=\"*\">\n<p id=\"b412-14\"> Pursuant to 5th Cir. R. 47.5, the court has determined that this opinion should not be published and is not precedent except under the limited circumstances set forth in 5th Cir R. 47.5.4.</p>\n</footnote>\n</opinion>\n</casebody>\n",
