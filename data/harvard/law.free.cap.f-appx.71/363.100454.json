McCotter, </em>766 F.2d 179 (5th Cir.1985). Hinojosa asserted that Sergeant King caused a cellmate to physically assault him by making it physically impossible for him, Hinojosa, to comply with lockdown rules that required the inmates to kneel before receiving their sack lunches. He asserted that other defendants were deliberately indifferent to his serious medical needs in the aftermath of the assault.</p>\n<p id=\"b402-13\">We review for abuse of discretion a district court\u2019s dismissal of a prison inmate\u2019s <em>in forma pauperis </em>complaint. <em>Taylor v. Johnson, </em>257 F.3d 470, 472 (5th Cir.2001) (citing <em>Harper v. Showers, </em>174 F.3d 716, 718 (5th Cir.1999)). A district court shall dismiss an IFP complaint at any time it determines that the complaint is frivolous. 28 U.S.C. \u00a7 1915(e)(2)(B)(i). A complaint is \u201cfrivolous\u201d if it lacks \u201c \u2018an arguable basis in law or fact.\u2019 \u201d <em>Berry v. Brady, </em>192 F.3d 504, 507 (5th Cir.1999) (quoting <em>Talib v. Gilley, </em>138 F.3d 211, 213 (5th Cir.1998)).</p>\n<p id=\"b402-14\">Hinojosa failed to allege facts sufficient to demonstrate that Sergeant King was aware of facts from which the inference could be drawn that there was a \u201csubstantial risk\u201d that the cellmate would assault Hinojosa. <em>See Farmer v. Brennan, </em>511 U.S. 825, 837, 114 S.Ct. 1970, 128 L.Ed.2d 811 (1994); <em>Newton v. Black, </em>133 F.3d 301, 308 (5th Cir.1998). Similarly, Hinojosa has not demonstrated that defendant Officers Campos and Haskins and Sergeant Acosta were deliberately indifferent to his serious medical needs following the assault. <em>See Estelle v. Gamble, </em>429 U.S. 97, 104-06, 97 S.Ct. 285, 50 L.Ed.2d 251 (1976); <em>Farmer, </em>511 U.S. at 837, 114 S.Ct. 1970.</p>\n<p id=\"b402-15\">Hinojosa has abandoned his claims against Warden Tomson, Major Cross, and an assistant warden, by failing to brief those claims on appeal. <em>See Yohey v. Collins, </em>985 F.2d 222, 224-25 (5th Cir.1993); Fed. R.App. P. 28(a)(9).</p>\n<p id=\"b402-16\">The judgment of the district court is AFFIRMED. Hinojosa\u2019s motion for appointment of counsel is DENIED, as he has not demonstrated that \u201cexceptional <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"365\">*365</page-number>circumstances\u201d exist. <em>See Ulmer v. Chancellor, </em>691 F.2d 209, 212 (5th Cir.1982).</p>\n<p id=\"b403-5\">AFFIRMED; MOTION DENIED.</p>\n<footnote label=\"*\">\n<p id=\"b402-11\"> Pursuant to 5th Cir. R. 47.5, the court has determined that this opinion should not be published and is not precedent except under the limited circumstances set forth in 5th Cir. R. 47.5.4.</p>\n</footnote>\n</opinion>\n</casebody>\n",
