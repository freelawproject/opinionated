Gray and his coconspirator pried off the mailbox panels in an apartment building, exposing 42 individual mailboxes. The building\u2019s security guard informed police that mail was in some of the individual boxes, but the record does not reflect how many of them contained mail.</p>\n<p id=\"b338-23\">The probation officer recommended adding two levels to Gray\u2019s base offense level, pursuant to Sentencing Guidelines \u00a7 2Bl.l(b)(2)(A), because there were more than ten and fewer than 50 victims. Gray objected to this adjustment, contending: under the Guidelines, there must be mail inside a mailbox for the owner to be considered a victim; and, because there was <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"301\">*301</page-number><em>no </em>indication how <em>many boxes </em>contained mail, there was insufficient evidence to show more than ten victims. The probation officer responded that the Guidelines require only that the object of the offense involve the theft of mail. The district court overruled Gray\u2019s objection.</p>\n<p id=\"b339-5\">We review interpretation of the Guidelines <em>de novo; </em>factual findings, for clear error. <em>E.g., United States v. Claiborne, </em>132 F.3d 253, 254 (5th Cir.), <em>cert. denied, </em>523 U.S. 1144, 118 S.Ct. 1855, 140 L.Ed.2d 1103 (1998). As noted, \u00a7 2B1.1(b)(2)(A) provides for a two-level adjustment if the offense involved ten or more, but fewer than 50, victims.</p>\n<blockquote id=\"b339-6\">In a case in which undelivered United States mail was taken, <em>or the taking of such item was an object of the offense, ... </em>\u2018victim\u2019 means [ (1) any person who sustained any part of an actual (financial) loss or bodily injury from the offense, or (2)] who was the intended recipient, or addressee, of the <em>undelivered </em>United States mail.</blockquote>\n<p id=\"b339-8\">\u00a7 2B1.1, cmt. n. 3(B)(i) (emphasis added). \u201cUndelivered United States mail\u201d means \u201cmail that has not actually been received by the addressee or his agent <em>{e.g., </em>mail taken from the addressee\u2019s mailbox)\u201d. \u00a7 2B1.1, cmt. n. 3(B)(iii).</p>\n<p id=\"b339-9\">Neither of the definitions of \u201cvictim\u201d are applicable to the 42 owners, absent evidence that they suffered damage or had undelivered mail. The management company, not the tenants, paid for the repairs to the boxes and was thus the only known economic victim. Moreover, as stated, there is no indication that Gray or his coconspirator actually removed mail from any of the individual mailboxes or that any mail went otherwise undelivered.</p>\n<p id=\"b339-10\">Presumably the taking of undelivered mail inside the boxes was the object of the offense, and the intended recipients of that mail were its intended victims. Thus, anyone who had mail could properly be counted as a victim for purposes of the Guideline. Again, however, there is no indication that this group was at least ten in number.</p>\n<p id=\"b339-12\">The Government relies, in part, on a \u201cspecial rule\u201d involving undelivered mail in a Postal Service box, vehicle, satchel, or cart, and for which there are unique proof problems concerning the number of victims. <em>See </em>U.S.S.G. \u00a7 2B1.1, cmt. n. 3(b)(ii). Needless to say, the \u201cspecial rule\u201d is not applicable.</p>\n<p id=\"b339-13\">The application of the number-of-victims adjustment is VACATED and the case REMANDED for resentencing consistent with this opinion.</p>\n<p id=\"b339-14\">\n<em>VACATED and REMANDED</em>\n</p>\n<footnote label=\"*\">\n<p id=\"b338-16\"> Pursuant to 5th Cir. R. 47.5, the court has determined that this opinion should not be published and is not precedent except under the limited circumstances set forth in 5th Cir. R. 47.5.4.</p>\n</footnote>\n</opinion>\n</casebody>\n",
