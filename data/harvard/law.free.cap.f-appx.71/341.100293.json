Stringer\u2019s 42 U.S.C. \u00a7 1983 complaint against appellee Wayne Herbert, a judge, was dismissed with prejudice by the district court. The district court\u2019s dismissal was based on its entry of summary judgment against Stringer and in favor of Herbert. On appeal, Stringer challenges only the district court\u2019s denial of his own summary judgment motion, the grant of Herbert\u2019s summary judgment motion, and an order entered declaring one of Stringer\u2019s evidentiary motions moot.</p>\n<p id=\"b380-7\">The district court granted Herbert\u2019s summary judgment motion, and denied Stringer\u2019s summary judgment motion as moot, on the basis that Herbert was entitled to absolute judicial immunity from the claims brought in Stringer\u2019s complaint. After <em>de novo </em>review of the record, we conclude that the summary judgment evidence supports the district court\u2019s actions and that Stringer has not shown on appeal that summary judgment was not properly entered against him. <em>See </em>Fed.R.Civ.P. 56(c); <em>Guillory v. Domtar Indus., Inc., </em>95 F.3d 1320, 1326 (5th Cir.1996); <em>Little v. Liquid Air Corp., 37 </em>F.3d 1069, 1075 (5th Cir.1994) (en banc); <em>Brinkmann v. Johnston, </em>793 F.2d 111, 112 (5th Cir.1986).</p>\n<p id=\"b380-8\">The district court\u2019s denial as moot of Stringer\u2019s motion for <em>de novo </em>review of the magistrate judge\u2019s evidentiary ruling was filed on the same day that the district court issued its opinion and order disposing of Stringer\u2019s complaint on summary judgment. We thus conclude that the district court\u2019s dismissal of Stringer\u2019s motion as moot was not an abuse of discretion. <em>See HC Gun &amp; Knife Shows, Inc. v. City of Houston, </em>201 F.3d 544, 549 (5th Cir.2000).</p>\n<p id=\"b380-13\">AFFIRMED.</p>\n<footnote label=\"*\">\n<p id=\"b380-9\"> Pursuant to 5th Cir. R. 47.5, the court has determined that this opinion should not be published and is not precedent except under the limited circumstances set forth in 5th Cir.
