The district court sentenced Guerra-Garza to thirty-three months\u2019 imprisonment and three years\u2019 supervised release.</p>\n<p id=\"b355-24\">Guerra-Garza challenges as improper and prejudicial comments made by the Assistant United States Attorney (AUSA) during his opening closing argument. The comments, as appellant characterizes them, implored the jury to take part in the war on drugs and proposed that in order to acquit Guerra-Garza, the jury would have to find that the Government\u2019s witnesses committed perjury and engaged in a conspiracy. Guerra-Garza contends that <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"318\">*318</page-number>the comments improperly bolstered the credibility of government witnesses, distracted the jury\u2019s attention from the evidence, and impermissibly interjected broader issues into the case. He contends that the Government\u2019s evidence on the issue of his knowledge of the marihuana was weak and inconsistent. He argues that the AUSA\u2019s comments interfered with the jury\u2019s assessment of the evidence, and he asserts that the improper comments were not cured by instruction. He argues that the comments affected the verdict and the fairness and integrity of the proceedings, amounted to plain error, and require reversal.</p>\n<p id=\"b356-4\">We must decide whether the disputed remarks were improper and whether the remarks \u201cprejudiced the defendant\u2019s substantive rights.\u201d <em>United States v. Munoz, </em>150 F.3d 401, 414, 415 (5th Cir.1998). Guerra-Garza concedes that review is for plain error as no objection whatever was made below. Under plain error review, we will reverse a conviction \u201c \u2018only if the government\u2019s closing arguments seriously affected the fairness or integrity of the proceedings and resulted in a miscarriage of justice.\u2019 \u201d <em>United States v. Knezek, </em>964 F.2d 394, 399 (5th Cir.1992). The \u201cprosecutor\u2019s comments must be considered in the context of the entire trial.\u201d <em>Id. </em>at 400.</p>\n<p id=\"b356-5\">If we assume for the purpose of argument that the challenged comments, separately or in combination, were improper, we must decide if \u201cthe jury would have found [Guerra-Garza] guilty had it not been for the prosecutor\u2019s improper argument.\u201d <em>United States v. Goff, </em>847 F.2d 149, 165 (5th Cir.1988). To do so, we consider the magnitude of the statements\u2019 prejudice, the curative effect of any \u201ccautionary instructions,\u201d and the strength of the evidence on guilt. <em>United States v. Tomblin, </em>46 F.3d 1369, 1389 (5th Cir.1995).</p>\n<p id=\"b356-6\">Defense counsel did not object to the AUSA\u2019s closing comments, and thus, the district court did not give specific curative instructions when the challenged comments were made. Prior to the presentation of evidence and in the charge, the district court directed the jury to consider only the evidence, namely the testimony given under oath and the exhibits that were admitted. The district court instructed the jury that statements and argument made by the district court and the lawyers were not evidence. <em>See United States v. Wyly, </em>193 F.3d 289, 299-300 (5th Cir.1999); <em>Tomblin, </em>46 F.3d at 1390-91; <em>United States v. Parekh, </em>926 F.2d 402, 408-09 (5th Cir.1991). The jury is presumed to follow its instructions. <em>Wyly, </em>193 F.3d at 299.</p>\n<p id=\"b356-8\">Guerra-Garza was indicted for conspiracy to distribute marihuana and for possession with intent to distribute less than one hundred kilograms of marihuana. The jury, which acquitted Guerra-Garza on the conspiracy charge, did not allow the AUSA\u2019s closing comments to influence its decision on the issue of Guerra-Garza\u2019s involvement in a drug conspiracy. The jury determines the credibility of the witnesses and was free to discredit Guerra\u2019s testimony on knowledge. <em>See United States v. Martinez, </em>975 F.2d 159, 161 (5th Cir.1992).</p>\n<p id=\"b356-9\">In light of the evidence presented, which was significantly stronger than that minimally necessary to sustain a conviction, and the district court\u2019s instructions, Guerra-Garza has not shown that the prejudicial effect of the AUSA\u2019s comments \u201c \u2018affected the fairness or integrity of the proceedings and resulted in a miscarriage of justice.\u2019\u201d <em>Knezek, </em>964 F.2d at 400. Accordingly, the judgment of the district court is</p>\n<p id=\"b356-10\">AFFIRMED.</p>\n<footnote label=\"*\">\n<p id=\"b355-17\"> Pursuant to 5th Cir. R. 47.5 the Court has determined that this opinion should not be published and is not precedent except under the limited circumstances set forth in 5th Cir.
