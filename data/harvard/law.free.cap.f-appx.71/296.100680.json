He is challenging a prison disciplinary conviction for failing to obey an order and being in an unauthorized place.</p>\n<p id=\"b334-23\">The district judge is married to the magistrate judge, and he therefore should have recused himself under 28 U.S.C. \u00a7 455(a) so that another judge could review the magistrate judge\u2019s report and recommendation. <em>See Jones v. Patrick, </em>54 Fed.Appx. 414 (5th Cir.2002) (unpublished) (same magistrate judge and same district judge as in present case).</p>\n<p id=\"b334-24\">A COA must be issued before this appeal may proceed. Fed. R.App. P. 22(b)(1). Accordingly, we GRANT a COA on the recusal issue, VACATE the judgment, and REMAND the case with directions that the magistrate judge\u2019s report and recommendation be considered by another district judge. <em>See Jones </em>at 2-3.</p>\n<p id=\"b334-25\">COA GRANTED; JUDGMENT VACATED; CASE REMANDED.</p>\n<footnote label=\"*\">\n<p id=\"b334-17\"> Pursuant to 5th Cir. R. 47.5, the court has determined that this opinion should not be published and is not precedent except under the limited circumstances set forth in 5th Cir. R. 47.5.4.</p>\n</footnote>\n</opinion>\n</casebody>\n",
