Tabe-Ebob contends: (1) she established that her failure to appear was due to exceptional circumstances and (2) the immigration judge erred by finding she did not submit an affidavit. Finding no reversible error, we affirm.</p>\n<p id=\"b280-17\">This Court\u2019s review of the Board\u2019s denial of a motion to reopen is extremely deferential, and the decision will not be reversed absent abuse of discretion. <em>Stewart v. INS, </em>181 F.3d 587, 595 (4th Cir.1999). Motions to reopen are disfavored. <em>INS v. Doherty, </em>502 U.S. 314, 323, 112 S.Ct. 719, 116 L.Ed.2d 823 (1992); 8 C.F.R. \u00a7 1003.2(c) (2003). We find the BLA did not abuse its discretion in finding that Tabe-Ebob failed to establish exceptional circumstances warranting granting a motion to reopen. <em>See 8 </em>U.S.C. \u00a7 1229a(b)(5)(C)(i), (e)(1) (2000). Assuming, <em>arguendo, </em>that the immigration judge erred regarding the affidavit, this Court reviews only the Board\u2019s findings. The Board has the authority to make its own findings. <em>Rusu v. INS, </em>296 F.3d 316, 320 n. 6 (4th Cir.2002). Here, the Board made an independent finding as to Tabe-Ebob\u2019s allegations in the motion to reopen.</p>\n<p id=\"b280-19\">Accordingly, we deny the petition for review. We dispense with oral argument because the facts and legal contentions are adequately presented in the materials before the court and argument would not aid the decisional process.</p>\n<p id=\"b280-20\">\n<em>PETITION DENIED.</em>\n</p>\n</opinion>\n</casebody>\n",
