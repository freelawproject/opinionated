He argues on appeal that the evidence admitted at his trial was insufficient to support a finding that the interstate commerce nexus, <em>as described in his indictment, </em>was met. His indictment reads, in pertinent part, that Trevino \u201cpossess[ed] firearms which had previously been shipped and transported in interstate commerce.\u201d He argues that this language requires a showing that he contemporaneously possessed firearms in interstate or foreign commerce. We disagree.</p>\n<p id=\"b369-5\">Section 922 \u201cprohibits certain people \u2018from receiving, possessing or transporting firearms in interstate or foreign commerce or firearms which have been shipped or transported in interstate or foreign commerce.\u2019 \u201d <em>United States v. Shelton, </em>987 F.2d 140, 142 (5th Cir.1991) (quoting <em>United States v. Perez, </em>No. 90-8177, 917 F.2d 560 (5th Cir. Sept.27, 1990)). In enacting section 922(g), we have held that Congress intended to describe broadly the nexus between commerce and the prohibited possession of a firearm by a felon. <em>Id. </em>at 148; <em>United States v. Fitzhugh, </em>984 F.2d 143, 146 (5th Cir.1993) (\u201c[A] convicted felon\u2019s possession of a firearm having a past connection to interstate commerce violates \u00a7 922(g)(1).\u201d). Accordingly, we have previously rejected efforts to so parse the language of section 922(g) as to differentiate among the activities that it prohibits in terms of \u201cdifferent levels of involvement in interstate commerce.\u201d <em>Shelton, </em>937 F.2d at 145. And we similarly reject Trevino\u2019s attempt to distinguish between possessing a firearm \u201cin commerce,\u201d and possessing a firearm \u201caffecting commerce.\u201d Evidence that a firearm has traveled interstate at some point in the past is thus sufficient to support a conviction under 18 U.S.C. \u00a7 922(g), even if the defendant possessed the firearm entirely intrastate. <em>United States v. Cavazos, </em>288 F.3d 706, 712 (5th Cir.2002), <em>cert. denied, </em>537 U.S. 910, 123 S.Ct. 253, 154 L.Ed.2d 189 (2002). We therefore conclude, after reviewing the record, that the evidence adduced at Trevino\u2019s trial was sufficient to support his conviction under the terms of his indictment. The judgment of the district court is</p>\n<p id=\"b369-7\">AFFIRMED.</p>\n<footnote label=\"*\">\n<p id=\"b368-22\"> Pursuant to 5th Cir.
