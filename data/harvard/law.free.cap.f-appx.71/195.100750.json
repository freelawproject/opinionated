Clamp was sentenced to 180 months\u2019 imprisonment as an armed career criminal, and Douglas was sentenced to ninety-five months\u2019 imprisonment. Both Douglas and Clamp challenge the district court\u2019s denial of their joint motion to suppress the illegal firearms recovered by police officers after <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"197\">*197</page-number>stopping and searching them in response to an informant\u2019s tip. Clamp also raises several challenges to his armed career criminal classification, which focus on whether pointing a gun at another person is a \u201cviolent felony.\u201d Finally, Clamp also challenges the assessment of one criminal history point under the pre-sentence report (\u201cPSR\u201d) for a previous misdemeanor conviction. We affirm both Douglas\u2019s and Clamp\u2019s convictions and sentences.</p>\n<p id=\"b235-5\">We review the legal conclusions underlying the denial of a motion to suppress de novo and review the predicate factual conclusions for clear error when assessed in the light most favorable to the party prevailing below. <em>United States v. Hamlin, </em>319 F.3d 666, 671 (4th Cir.2003). After careful consideration of the materials before us on appeal, we conclude that the police officers who searched and arrested Douglas and Clamp responded to an accurate tip given by a rehable, face-to-face informant. <em>See United States v. Christmas, </em>222 F.3d 141, 144 (4th Cir.2000). The officer\u2019s subsequent verification of the tip provided reasonable suspicion to initiate a stop pursuant to <em>Terry v. Ohio, </em>392 U.S. 1, 88 S.Ct. 1868, 20 L.Ed.2d 889 (1968).</p>\n<p id=\"b235-6\">We further find that Clamp\u2019s claims of sentencing error are without merit. Clamp\u2019s complaint that he was improperly assessed an additional criminal history point is baseless. <em>See U.S. Sentencing Guidelines Manual </em>\u00a7 4A1.2, comment. (backg\u2019d) (2000). Moreover, we find that Clamp\u2019s South Carolina conviction for pointing a firearm at another person is a \u201cviolent felony\u201d for purposes of the Armed Career Criminal Act. <em>See </em>18 U.S.C. \u00a7 924(e)(2)(B)(i)-(ii) (2000). We reject Clamp\u2019s contention that whether the South Carolina firearm offense is a \u201cviolent felony\u201d for purposes of the Armed Career Criminal Act is controlled by South Carolina\u2019s characterization of the offense as non-violent. <em>See Taylor v. United States, </em>495 U.S. 575, 590, 110 S.Ct. 2143, 109 L.Ed.2d 607 (1990) (noting that elements of state offenses are determinative regardless of technical definitions and labels under state law); <em>see also United States v. Sacko, </em>247 F.3d 21, 25 (1st Cir.2001) (noting that \u201cbecause a state\u2019s classification of a crime generally reflects different policy considerations than the federal classification, it is simply not relevant to the determination of whether a crime is a \u2018violent felony\u2019 \u201d under federal law).</p>\n<p id=\"b235-8\">Accordingly, we affirm both convictions and sentences. We dispense with oral argument, because the facts and legal contentions are adequately presented in the materials before the court and argument would not aid the decisional process.</p>\n<p id=\"b235-9\">\n<em>AFFIRMED.</em>\n</p>\n</opinion>\n</casebody>\n",
