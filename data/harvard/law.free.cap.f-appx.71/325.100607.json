The jury awarded damages for pain and suffering, but it did not award any amount for lost wages.</p>\n<p id=\"b364-3\"><page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"326\">*326</page-number>On appeal, Triggs challenges the district court\u2019s refusal to allow the introduction of the deposition testimony of Kenneth Wiggins. Triggs, however, did not adequately show Wiggins\u2019s unavailability and has not shown that the district court erred in determining that the jury could not evaluate Wiggins\u2019s credibility. We find no abuse of discretion. <em>See </em>Fed. R. Civ. P. 32(a)(3)(D); <em>Bobb v. Modem Products, Inc., </em>648 F.2d 1051, 1055 (5th Cir.1981), overruled on other grounds, <em>Gautreaux v. Scurlock Marine, Inc., </em>107 F.3d 331 (5th Cir.1997).</p>\n<p id=\"b364-4\">Triggs also argues that the district court erred in refusing to allow him to impeach a defense expert\u2019s testimony with the deposition of Wiggins, which the expert admitted he had reviewed. A review of both the expert\u2019s testimony and Wiggins\u2019s deposition shows that the expert\u2019s testimony was not inconsistent with Wiggins\u2019s deposition testimony. We conclude this argument is without merit.</p>\n<p id=\"b364-5\">Triggs argues that the jury\u2019s failure to award any amount for lost wages or lost meal benefits was contrary to the law and evidence. Based upon our review of the record, we conclude that the jury\u2019s verdict should be affirmed because the facts and inferences do not \u201cpoint so strongly and so overwhelmingly in favor of [Triggs\u2019s claims] that reasonable men could not arrive at any verdict to the contrary.\u201d <em>Granberry v. O\u2019Barr, </em>866 F.2d 112, 113 (5th Cir.1988) (internal quotation omitted).</p>\n<p id=\"b364-6\">AFFIRMED.</p>\n<footnote label=\"*\">\n<p id=\"b363-17\"> Pursuant to 5th Cir.
