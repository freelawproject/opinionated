He was sentenced to 292 months on Count One, to be followed by sixty months on Count Two. Mateo\u2019s attorney has filed a brief in accordance with <em>Anders v. California, </em>386 U.S. 738, 87 S.Ct. 1396, 18 L.Ed.2d 493 (1967), raising one claim but stating that, in his opinion, there are no meritorious issues for review. Mateo was informed of his right to file a pro se brief, but has not filed such a brief. We affirm.</p>\n<p id=\"b997-22\">In the <em>Anders </em>brief, Mateo argues that trial counsel was ineffective for failing to obtain a more favorable plea agreement and a more lenient sentence. We note that Mateo pleaded guilty to two counts of a six-count indictment and the Government dropped the remaining four counts in exchange for the guilty plea. After thoroughly reviewing the materials before us, we conclude that ineffective assistance does not conclusively appear on the face of <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"960\">*960</page-number>the record. Mateo should raise his ineffectiveness claim, if at all, in a motion filed pursuant to 28 U.S.C. \u00a7 2255 (2000). <em>See United States v. Richardson, </em>195 F.3d 192, 198 (4th Cir.1999); <em>United States v. King, </em>119 F.3d 290, 295 (4th Cir.1997).</p>\n<p id=\"b998-4\">We accordingly affirm. We have, as required by <em>Anders, </em>reviewed the entire record and have found no meritorious issues for appeal. This court requires that counsel inform his client, in writing, of his right to petition the Supreme Court of the United States for further review. If Mateo requests that a petition be filed, but counsel believes that such a petition would be frivolous, then counsel may move in this court to withdraw from representation. Counsel\u2019s motion must state that copy of the motion was served on Mateo. We dispense with oral argument because the facts and legal arguments are adequately presented in the materials before the court and argument would not aid the decisional process.</p>\n<p id=\"b998-5\">\n<em>AFFIRMED.</em>\n</p>\n</opinion>\n</casebody>\n",
