He argues that the district court erred by increasing his base offense level by 16 levels pursuant to U.S.S.G. \u00a7 2L1.2(b)(1)(A). Lucio did not raise this objection in the district court, and, therefore, our review is for plain error only. <em>See United States v. Vasquez, </em>216 F.3d 456, 459 (5th Cir.2000).</p>\n<p id=\"b453-22\">Section 2L1.1(b)(1)(A) provides that \u201c[i]f the defendant previously was deported, ... after a conviction for a felony that is [ ] a drug trafficking offense for which the sentence imposed exceeded 13 months,\u201d the base offense level is to be increased by 16 levels. U.S.S.G. \u00a7 2L1.1(b)(1)(A) (2001). According to the presentence report, Lucio was convicted of trafficking by possession with intent to distribute cocaine and was sentenced to nine years\u2019 imprisonment. Lucio offered no evidence rebutting the reported length of this sentence; therefore, the presentence report bore sufficient indicia of reliability such that it was not plainly erroneous for the district court to apply the 16-level enhancement. <em>See United States v. Huerta, </em>182 F.3d 361, 364 (5th Cir.1999).</p>\n<p id=\"b453-24\">AFFIRMED.</p>\n<footnote label=\"*\">\n<p id=\"b453-19\"> Pursuant to 5th Cir. R. 47.5, the court has determined that this opinion should not be published and is not precedent except under the limited circumstances set forth in 5th Cir. R. 47.5.4.</p>\n</footnote>\n</opinion>\n</casebody>\n",
