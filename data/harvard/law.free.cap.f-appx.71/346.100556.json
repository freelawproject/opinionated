Oliveros contends that the district court erred by admitting evidence of his prior conviction for aiding and abetting an undocumented alien to attempt to elude examination by Border Patrol agents in violation of 8 U.S.C. \u00a7 1325(a). He asserts that this evidence was only marginally relevant and that its probative value was substantially outweighed by the danger of unfair prejudice. <em>See </em>Fed.R.Evid. 404(b).</p>\n<p id=\"b385-13\">The evidence at trial established that the alien Oliveros was accused of transporting was concealed in the truck of his vehicle. Thus, evidence of his knowledge and intent were at issue. Indeed, counsel for Oliveros acknowledged, before evidence of the prior conviction was admitted, that Oliveros\u2019s intent would be at issue. Moreover, there is no question but that Oliveros\u2019s prior conviction was relevant to these issues; the extrinsic offense required the same intent as the charged offense. <em>See United States v. McMahon, </em>592 F.2d 871, 873 (5th Cir.1979) (holding that aiding and abetting an alien to elude examination requires the same culpable mental state as the offense of transporting aliens). We also agree that the incremental probative value of the evidence was not substantially outweighed by the potential for unfair prejudice. The extrinsic offense was similar to the charged offense, and was clearly proximate in time, a conviction for the extrinsic offense having been obtained only four months prior to the commission of the charged offense. <em>See id. </em>at 873-74. The introduction of the extrinsic offense did not carry significant danger of unfair prejudice. Oliveros\u2019s prior conviction was not heinous in nature and was not of a type \u201clikely to incite the jury to an irrational decision.\u201d <em>Id. </em>at 876. Finally, we conclude that any prejudicial effect of the extrinsic offense evidence was minimized by the district court\u2019s limiting instruction, an instruction that Oliveros\u2019s counsel had previously requested. <em>Id. </em>at 873, 876. Accordingly, the district court did not abuse its discretion in admitting evidence of 01-<page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"348\">*348</page-number>iveros\u2019s prior conviction. <em>See United States v. Beechum, </em>582 F.2d 898, 911 (5th Cir.1978) (en banc).</p>\n<p id=\"b386-4\">AFFIRMED.</p>\n<footnote label=\"*\">\n<p id=\"b385-11\"> Pursuant to 5th Cir.
