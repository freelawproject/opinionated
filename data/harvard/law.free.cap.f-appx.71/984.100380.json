The district court concluded that Asmath had previously been convicted of two crimes of violence, and therefore qualified for an enhanced sentence as a Career Offender under the Sentencing Guidelines. <em>See U.S. Sentencing Guidelines Manual </em>(\u201cUSSG\u201d) \u00a7 4B1.1 (2001). On appeal, As-math contends that the evidence at sentencing was insufficient to establish that she was in fact the person who was convicted of the predicate crimes.</p>\n<p id=\"b1022-22\">We review a district court\u2019s resolution of factual questions at sentencing under the clearly erroneous standard. <em>United States v. Daughtrey, </em>874 F.2d 213, 217 (4th Cir. 1989). A defendant is a career offender if she was at least eighteen years old when the instant offense was committed, the instant offense is a felony and is either a crime of violence or a drug offense, and she has at least two prior felony convictions for crimes of violence or drug of<page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"985\">*985</page-number>fenses. <em>See </em>USSG \u00a7 4B1.1. Asmath does not dispute the first two requirements, nor does she contest that the convictions in question were felony convictions for crimes of violence. She argues that her identity as the person who was convicted of those crimes was not sufficiently established to qualify her for an enhanced sentence. Our review of the record convinces us that the district court did not err in concluding that Asmath\u2019s identity was adequately established and that she was a career offender.</p>\n<p id=\"b1023-5\">Accordingly, we affirm Asmath\u2019s conviction and sentence. We dispense with oral argument because the facts and legal contentions are adequately presented in the materials before the court and argument would not aid the decisional process.</p>\n<p id=\"b1023-6\">\n<em>AFFIRMED.</em>\n</p>\n</opinion>\n</casebody>\n",
