(\u201cInterState\u201d) for losses it suffered following a 1996 flood of the Greenbrier River in West Virginia. However, this court may exercise jurisdiction only over final orders, 28 U.S.C. \u00a7 1291 (2000), and certain interlocutory and collateral orders, 28 U.S.C. \u00a7 1292 (2000); Fed.R.Civ.P. 54(b); <em>Cohen v. Beneficial Indus. Loan Corp., </em>337 U.S. 541, 69 S.Ct. 1221, 93 L.Ed. 1528 (1949). To the extent the order appealed fails to <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"216\">*216</page-number>set damages, it is neither a final order nor an appealable interlocutory or collateral order. <em>See Liberty Mut. Ins. Co. v. Wetzel, </em>424 U.S. 737, 743 n. 4, 744, 96 S.Ct. 1202, 47 L.Ed.2d 435 (1976).<footnotemark>*</footnotemark></p>\n<p id=\"b254-4\">Further, we observe that the parties\u2019 stipulation did not purport to resolve \u201cthe existence, nature, extent or cause of [Inter-State\u2019s] alleged loss,\u201d or waive any defenses (J.A. 68), and that Hartford Steam limited its motion to the narrow issue of \u201cwhether or not the Policy provides coverage for Inter-State\u2019s claim ... assuming that such damage was caused as alleged by Inter-State\u201d (J.A. 93). In light of the conditional nature of the parties\u2019 joint stipulation and Hartford Steam\u2019s pleadings, it appears the district court\u2019s order did not conclusively determine all of the parties\u2019 rights, <em>see, e.g., Fox v. Baltimore City Police Dept., </em>201 F.3d 526, 530-31 (4th Cir.2000), and that resolution of these issues would be appropriate. <em>Cf. </em>Fed. R.Civ.P. 56(d) (describing proceedings appropriate when a motion for summary judgment does not fully adjudicate the case); <em>Virginia Hosp. Assoc. v. Balites, </em>830 F.2d 1308, 1310 n. 1 (4th Cir.1987) (noting it was appropriate for district court to consider on remand issues raised, but not initially resolved, in a motion for summary judgment).</p>\n<p id=\"b254-5\">Accordingly, we dismiss the appeal for lack of jurisdiction. We dispense with oral argument because the facts and legal contentions are adequately presented in the materials before the court and argument would not aid the decisional process.</p>\n<p id=\"b254-6\">\n<em>DISMISSED.</em>\n</p>\n<footnote label=\"*\">\n<p id=\"b254-8\"> \"The order ... constitutes a grant of partial summary judgment limited to the issue of petitioner's liability. Such judgments are by their terms interlocutory, <em>see </em>[Fed.R.Civ.PJ 56(c), and where assessment of damages or awarding of other relief remains to be resolved have never been considered to be 'final'within the meaning of [\u00a7 1291].\u201d</p>\n</footnote>\n</opinion>\n</casebody>\n",
