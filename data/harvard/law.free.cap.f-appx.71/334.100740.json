Ramos appeals his jury trial convictions of conspiracy to possess cocaine and marijuana with intent to distribute and possession of cocaine with intent to distribute. Ramos contends that he is entitled to reversal because, pursuant to <em>Daubert, </em>the district court rejected his proffer of expert testimony that a voice on an inculpatory audiotape was not that of Ramos.<footnotemark>1</footnotemark></p>\n<p id=\"b373-16\">This court \u201creview[s] the district court\u2019s determination of admissibility of expert testimony under <em>Daubert </em>for abuse of discretion.\u201d <footnotemark>2</footnotemark> If we find an abuse of discretion, we \u201creview the error under the harmless error doctrine, affirming the judgment [] unless the ruling affected substantial rights of the complaining party.\u201d<footnotemark>3</footnotemark> A qualified person may testify as an expert \u201cif (1) the testimony is based upon sufficient facts or data, (2) the testimony is the product of reliable principles and methods, and (8) the witness has applied the principles and methods reliably to the facts of the case.\u201d <footnotemark>4</footnotemark> <em>Daubert </em>holds that Rule 702 imposes a special obligation upon the district court to \u201censure that any and all scientific testimony or evidence admitted is not only relevant, but rehable.\u201d<footnotemark>5</footnotemark> The proponent must <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"336\">*336</page-number>prove reliability by a preponderance of the evidence.<footnotemark>6</footnotemark></p>\n<p id=\"b374-4\">The district court excluded the testimony of Ramos\u2019s expert because Ramos failed to show that it passed muster under Rule 702 and the criteria in Daubert.<footnotemark>7</footnotemark> The district court\u2019s decision to exclude the testimony was not based on an erroneous interpretation of Rule 702 or <em>Daubert, </em>or on a clearly erroneous assessment of the expert\u2019s proposed testimony. Accordingly, the ruling did not constitute an abuse of discretion.</p>\n<p id=\"b374-5\">Assuming <em>arguendo </em>that there was error, Ramos still is not entitled to relief because exclusion of the expert\u2019s testimony did not affect his substantial rights. By his expert\u2019s testimony, Ramos sought to challenge only the admissibility of one tape that contained his voice; Ramos did not challenge the admissibility of the other tapes that contained his voice or of the tapes that contained voices of other co-conspirators talking about Ramos\u2019s involvement in the conspiracy. Without any reliance on the one challenged tape, the Government presented overwhelming evidence of Ramos\u2019s guilt.<footnotemark>8</footnotemark></p>\n<p id=\"b374-6\">Ramos also contends, for the first time on appeal, that he is entitled to reversal because he was denied his Sixth Amendment right to present a defense. The Eighth Circuit rejected a similar challenge in <em>United States v. Bohena </em>after concluding that the <em>Daubert </em>rule is not arbitrary and the application of <em>Daubert </em>in that case was not \u201cdisproportionate to its purpose, in the sense that it might [have] unreasonably restriet[ed] the defendant\u2019s right to present evidence in his own defense.\u201d<footnotemark>9</footnotemark> The same is true in Ramos\u2019s case. Accordingly, Ramos\u2019s Sixth Amendment rights were not violated by the district court\u2019s <em>Daubert </em>ruling.</p>\n<p id=\"b374-8\">AFFIRMED.</p>\n<footnote label=\"*\">\n<p id=\"b373-10\"> Pursuant to 5th Cir.
