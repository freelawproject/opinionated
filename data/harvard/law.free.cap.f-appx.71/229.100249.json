On appeal, Pouncy challenges the enhancement of his offense level for obstruction of justice.</p>\n<p id=\"b268-11\">A two-level enhancement of a defendant\u2019s base offense level is warranted if:</p>\n<blockquote id=\"AlP\">(A) the defendant willfully obstructed or impeded, or attempted to obstruct or impede, the administration of justice during the course of the investigation, prosecution, or sentencing of the instant offense of conviction, and (B) the obstructive conduct related to (i) the defendant\u2019s offense of conviction and any relevant conduct; or (n) a closely related offense.</blockquote>\n<p id=\"b268-12\"><em>U.S. Sentencing Guidelines Manual </em>\u00a7 3C1.1 (2000). To warrant an enhancement under this section, false evidence provided by the defendant must be \u201cmaterial,\u201d that is, \u201cinformation that, if believed, would tend to influence or affect the issue under determination.\u201d USSG \u00a7 3C1.1, comment, (n.6). Furthermore, such a material false statement includes one that significantly obstructs or impedes the official investigation or prosecution of the instant offense. USSG \u00a7 3C1.1, comment. (n.4(g)).</p>\n<p id=\"b268-14\">The district court must find that the defendant \u201c \u2018consciously acted with the purpose of obstructing justice.\u2019 \u201d <em>United States v. Romulus, </em>949 F.2d 713, 717 (4th Cir.1991) (quoting <em>United States v. Stroud, </em>893 F.2d 504, 507 (2d Cir.1990)). This court reviews the district court\u2019s findings for clear error. <em>United States v. Puckett, </em>61 F.3d 1092, 1095 (4th Cir.1995); <em>United States v. Daughtrey, </em>874 F.2d 213, 217 (4th Cir.1989).</p>\n<p id=\"b268-15\">The presentence report applied an enhancement for obstruction of justice under \u00a7 3C1.1 because Pouncy lied when he initially told Bureau of Alcohol, Tobacco, and Firearms (ATF) special agents that firearms he had purchased in West Virginia were stolen from a U-Haul truck in that jurisdiction. More than one year later, Pouncy admitted the guns were stolen from the trunk of his car in Detroit, Michigan. On appeal, Pouncy claims the guns, eventually located through the use of a federal \u201cSuspect Gun\u201d registry, would not have been identified any faster had he initially provided correct information to the ATF agents.</p>\n<p id=\"b268-16\">It is undisputed Pouncy provided false information as to the location from which the guns were stolen. ATF agents spent resources and time developing leads and attempting to locate the guns in West Virginia, where Pouncy initially told them they were stolen. If ATF agents had the <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"231\">*231</page-number>correct information that the guns had been stolen in Detroit, their investigation would not have been so impeded. Furthermore, because Pouncy did not change his story until after his guilty plea hearing occurred, it is entirely plausible that he intentionally misled authorities to avoid liability for interstate transportation of the firearms.</p>\n<p id=\"b269-5\">Therefore, we affirm Pouncjfs sentence. We dispense with oral argument because the facts and legal contentions have been adequately presented in the materials before the court and argument would not aid the decisional process.</p>\n<p id=\"b269-6\">\n<em>AFFIRMED.</em>\n</p>\n</opinion>\n</casebody>\n",
