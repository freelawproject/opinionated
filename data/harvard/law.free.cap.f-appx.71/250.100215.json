She also appeals the order of the district court denying her motion to withdraw her guilty plea. The Government has moved to dismiss the appeal as waived pursuant to a waiver of appellate rights contained in the plea agreement. For the reasons stated below, we dismiss the appeal on the Government\u2019s motion as to McQuinn\u2019s sentencing claims and affirm the district court\u2019s order denying her motion to withdraw her guilty plea.</p>\n<p id=\"b288-23\">\u201c[A] waiver of appeal rights in a plea agreement will not bar appellate review of the denial of a motion to withdraw the underlying guilty plea when the plea-withdrawal motion incorporates a colorable claim that the plea agreement itself \u2014 and hence the waiver of appeal rights that it contains \u2014 is tainted by constitutional error.\u201d <em>United States v. Attar, </em>38 F.3d 727, 733 n. 2 (4th Cir.1994). McQuinn claims her plea was unknowing and involuntary. We find that this claim is outside the scope <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"251\">*251</page-number>of the waiver, and thus deny the Government\u2019s motion with respect to this claim, and proceed to review the district court\u2019s order.</p>\n<p id=\"b289-5\">The district court\u2019s denial of a motion to withdraw a guilty plea is reviewed for abuse of discretion. <em>United States v. Ubakanma, </em>215 F.3d 421, 424 (4th Cir. 2000). A defendant does not have an absolute right to withdraw a guilty plea. <em>United States v. Moore, </em>931 F.2d 245, 248 (4th Cir.1991). Rather, a defendant bears the burden of demonstrating that a \u201cfair and just reason\u201d supports her request to withdraw her plea. <em>Id. </em>McQuinn cannot meet this standard, and the district court did not abuse its discretion in denying the motion to withdraw her guilty plea. We therefore affirm its order.</p>\n<p id=\"b289-6\">McQuinn raises two claims regarding her sentence. The plea agreement specifically included a waiver of McQuinn\u2019s right to appeal her sentence. A waiver of appeal provision in a valid plea agreement is enforceable if it resulted from a knowing and intelligent decision to forgo an appeal. Attar, 38 F.3d at 731; <em>United States v. Wiggins, </em>905 F.2d 51, 53 (4th Cir.1990). This court reviews de novo the validity of a waiver. <em>United States v. Brown, </em>232 F.3d 399, 402-03 (4th Cir.2000). We conclude that McQuinn knowingly agreed to the waiver. Therefore, as to McQuinn\u2019s challenge to her sentence, we grant the Government\u2019s motion and dismiss the appeal.</p>\n<p id=\"b289-7\">We dispense with oral argument because the facts and legal contentions are adequately presented in the materials before the court and argument would not aid the decisional process.</p>\n<p id=\"b289-8\">\n<em>AFFIRMED IN PART, DISMISSED IN PART.</em>\n</p>\n</opinion>\n</casebody>\n",
