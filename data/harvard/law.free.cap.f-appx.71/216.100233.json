After conducting a thorough Fed. R.Crim.P. 11 colloquy, the district court found Foster guilty, and sentenced him to 151 months\u2019 imprisonment and five years\u2019 supervised release. Foster\u2019s attorney has filed a brief in accordance with <em>Anders v. California, </em>386 U.S. 738, 87 S.Ct. 1396, 18 L.Ed.2d 493 (1967), claiming abuse of discretion in the district court\u2019s denial of Foster\u2019s motion to withdraw his guilty plea, and error in the district court\u2019s failure to compel the government to file a downward departure motion based on substantial assistance, but concluding that there are no meritorious grounds for appeal. Foster was notified of his right to file an additional brief, which he failed to do. In accordance with the requirements of <em>Anders, </em>we have examined the entire record and find no meritorious issues for appeal.</p>\n<p id=\"b255-13\">We find no merit to Foster\u2019s specific claims on appeal. The district court complied with the mandates of Fed.R.Crim.P. 11, and Foster testified specifically during that hearing that the plea agreement, which contained no provision or promise of a USSG \u00a7 5K1.1 motion for downward departure for substantial assistance, reflected the entire agreement between he and the government, and that there were no promises made to him other than those promises outlined in his plea agreement. The record reflects that Foster\u2019s plea was knowing and voluntarily entered into. Because Foster failed to present a fair and just reason to withdraw his guilty plea, we find no abuse of discretion by the district court in its failure to allow the withdrawal. <em>United States v. Moore, </em>931 F.2d 245, 248 (4th Cir.1991).</p>\n<p id=\"b255-14\">Moreover, we find nothing in the record to substantiate Foster\u2019s claim that the government\u2019s refusal to move for a downward departure on Foster\u2019s behalf was based on any unconstitutional motive or that it was not rationally related to a permissible government objective. <em>See Wade v. United States, </em>504 U.S. 181, 185-86, 112 S.Ct. 1840, 118 L.Ed.2d 524 (1992); <em>United States v. LeRose, </em>219 F.3d 335, 342 (4th Cir.2000). Accordingly, we affirm Foster\u2019s conviction and sentence.</p>\n<p id=\"b255-15\">This court requires that counsel inform his client, in writing, of his right to petition the Supreme Court of the United States <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"218\">*218</page-number>for further review. If the client requests that a petition be filed, but counsel believes that such a petition would be frivolous, then counsel may move in this court for leave to withdraw from representation. Counsel\u2019s motion must state that a copy thereof was served on the client. We dispense with oral argument because the facts and legal contentions are adequately presented in the materials before the court and argument would not aid the decisional process.</p>\n<p id=\"b256-4\">\n<em>AFFIRMED.</em>\n</p>\n</opinion>\n</casebody>\n",
