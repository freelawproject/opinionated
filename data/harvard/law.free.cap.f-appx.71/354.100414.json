He filed a 42 U.S.C. \u00a7 1983 complaint against the above named defendants and alleged that, while he was in the detention center, the defendants acted with deliberate indifference and failed to protect him from an assault of another prisoner. Caldwell appeals the magistrate judge\u2019s grant of summary judgment and dismissal of the case.</p>\n<p id=\"b393-7\">Caldwell\u2019s motion for the appointment of appellate counsel is DENIED.</p>\n<p id=\"b393-8\">Our <em>de novo </em>review of the record reveals that the evidence demonstrated that Caldwell did not suffer an injury that was more than <em>de minimis. See Gomez v. Chandler, </em>163 F.3d 921, 924-25 (5th Cir.1999); <em>Siglar v. Hightower, </em>112 F.3d 191, 193 (5th Cir. 1997); <em>Little v. Liquid Air Corp., </em>37 F.3d 1069, 1075 (5th Cir.1994) (en banc). The summary judgment is AFFIRMED.</p>\n<footnote label=\"*\">\n<p id=\"b393-10\"> Pursuant to 5th Cir. R. 47.5, the court has determined that this opinion should not be published and is not precedent except under the limited circumstances set forth in 5th Cir. R. 47.5.4.</p>\n</footnote>\n</opinion>\n</casebody>\n",
