Pena argues that the district court erred in 1) denying his motion for mistrial based on witness Clara Bradley\u2019s statement that her testimony would result in \u201cputting [Pena] away again,\u201d 2) allowing witness Rhonda Strain to testify regarding Pena\u2019s association/relationship with Taylor, and 3) adopting the presentence report (\u201cPSR\u201d)\u2019s drug-quantity findings. As his sole ground of error, Taylor argues that the district court erred in admitting Strain\u2019s testimony regarding Taylor\u2019s subsequent bad acts of soliciting her help to purchase methamphetamine ingredients and giving her methamphetamine in exchange for her cleaning of his apartment.</p>\n<p id=\"b406-4\">Because Pena failed to timely object to the admission of the evidence upon which his motion for mistrial is based, we review this issue only for plain error. <em>See </em>Fed. R.Crim. P. 52(b); <em>United States v. Caucci </em>635 F.2d 441, 448 (5th Cir.1981). Under the plain-error standard of review, we may address Pena\u2019s argument only if (1) there is an error, (2) the error is plain, and (3) the error affects substantial rights. <em>See United States v. Olano, </em>507 U.S. 725, 732-35, 113 S.Ct. 1770, 123 L.Ed.2d 508 (1993). Because Pena has not shown that Bradley\u2019s reference to his previous incarceration had a substantial impact upon the jury\u2019s verdict or otherwise affected Pena\u2019s substantial rights, he has not demonstrated plain error. <em>Id.; United States v. Paul, </em>142 F.3d 836, 844 (5th Cir.1998); <em>United States v. Millsaps, </em>157 F.3d 989, 993 (5th Cir.1998).</p>\n<p id=\"b406-5\">Strain\u2019s testimony regarding Pena\u2019s association/relationship with Taylor was relevant to the conspiracy charge. <em>See United States v. Cardenas, </em>9 F.3d 1139, 1157 (5th Cir.1993) (\u201c[Association is a factor that, along with other evidence, may be relied upon to find conspiratorial activity by the defendant.\u201d). Pena has failed to demonstrate that this testimony was unfairly prejudicial. Therefore, we conclude that the district court did not abuse its discretion by admitting Strain\u2019s association/relationship testimony. <em>See United States v. Hays, </em>872 F.2d 582, 587 (5th Cir.1989); <em>United States v. Pace, </em>10 F.3d 1106, 1115-16 (5th Cir.1993). We also conclude that the district court did not abuse its discretion by admitting Strain\u2019s testimony regarding Taylor\u2019s subsequent bad acts; Taylor placed his intent at issue by pleading not guilty, <em>see United States v. Chavez, </em>119 F.3d 342, 346 (5th Cir.1997), and the challenged evidence was highly probative of his knowledge and intent to commit the charged offense. The fact that Taylor\u2019s bad acts occurred subsequent to the events that are the subject of the charged offense does not mean that evidence of those bad acts must be excluded under Rule 404(b). <em>See United States v. Peterson, </em>244 F.3d 385, 392 (5th Cir.2001) (\u201cOur prior decisions clearly allow for evidence of \u201cbad acts\u201d subsequent to the subject matter of the trial for the purpose of demonstrating intent.\u201d).</p>\n<p id=\"b406-7\">Finally, based on the evidence adduced at trial and offered in response to Pena\u2019s drug-quantity objection, the district court\u2019s drug-quantity finding was plausible. Accordingly, the district court did not clearly err in its drug-quantity calculation with respect to Pena. <em>See United States v. Shipley, </em>963 F.2d 56, 58 (5th Cir.1992); <em>United States v. Ponce, </em>917 F.2d 841, 842 (5th Cir.1990).</p>\n<p id=\"b406-8\">AFFIRMED.</p>\n<footnote label=\"*\">\n<p id=\"b405-17\"> Pursuant to 5th Cir.
