Clapp\u2019s sole argument on appeal is that the district court erred in sentencing him as an armed career criminal because his 1976 Tennessee conviction for attempted second degree burglary is not a \u201cviolent felony\u201d under \u00a7 924(e). We affirm.</p>\n<p id=\"b318-10\">Under 18 U.S.C. \u00a7 922(g)(1), it is unlawful for a convicted felon to possess a firearm. An individual who violates \u00a7 922(g) faces a minimum fifteen-year sentence if he has three prior convictions for violent felonies or serious drug offenses. 18 U.S.C. \u00a7 924(e). To constitute a violent felony for purposes of armed career criminal offender status, the potential for injury is determinative. The court must focus on the fact of conviction and the statutory definition of the crime, rather than on the underlying facts of a particular conviction. <em>Taylor v. United States, </em>495 U.S. 575, 600-01, 110 S.Ct. 2143, 109 L.Ed.2d 607 (1990). This court reviews legal issues concerning sentences de novo. <em>United States v. Daughtrey, </em>874 F.2d 213, 217 (4th Cir. 1989). Similarly, the legal determinations attendant to the application of the Armed Career Criminal Act are analyzed de novo. <em>See </em>18 U.S.C. \u00a7 924(e)(1) (2000); <em>United States v. Brandon, </em>247 F.3d 186, 188 (4th Cir.2001).</p>\n<p id=\"b318-12\">We have reviewed the record and the parties\u2019 submissions and find this appeal foreclosed by our decisions in <em>United States v. Custis, </em>988 F.2d 1355 (4th Cir. 1993) (holding that attempted breaking and entering under Maryland law is a \u201cviolent felony\u201d for purposes of 924(e) because of its potential for physical confrontation), and <em>United States v. Thomas, </em>2 F.3d 79 (4th Cir.1993) (same for attempted burglary under New Jersey law). Accordingly, the judgment of the district court is affirmed. We dispense with oral argument because the facts and legal contentions are adequately presented in the materials before the court and argument would not aid the decisional process.</p>\n<p id=\"b318-13\">\n<em>AFFIRMED.</em>\n</p>\n</opinion>\n</casebody>\n",
