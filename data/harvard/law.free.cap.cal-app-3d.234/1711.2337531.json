Bertram Bernard Katz against Joyce Tullos Katz in favor of judgment creditor-lienor Dietmar E. Rothe (Rothe). The judgment was entered on a noticed motion for an order enforcing a judgment lien pursuant to Code of Civil Procedure sections 708.410-708.480.<footnotemark>1</footnotemark></p>\n<p id=\"b1190-3\"><page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"1714\">*1714</page-number>II. Procedural and Factual Matters</p>\n<p id=\"b1190-4\">For purposes of clarity, the wife and husband will be referred to by their first names. Joyce petitioned for legal separation on August 16, 1985. In a consolidated Los Angeles Superior Court action case No. C628209 filed on December 10, 1986, Joyce sought judicial determinations concerning property that had been acquired during the course of the couple\u2019s relationship before and after their marriage in 1976. Rothe obtained a judgment against Bertram in San Diego Superior Court case No. 501534 which was entered on July 31, 1987. On September 25, 1987, Rothe filed a notice of lien pursuant to section 708.410, subdivision (b) against Bertram in the marriage dissolution action between Joyce and Bertram. Copies of the lien notice were served on counsel for Joyce and Bertram. On August 30, 1987, pursuant to section 708.470,<footnotemark>2</footnotemark> Rothe moved in the marital dissolution action for an order that any judgment entered in the marital dissolution action in Bertram\u2019s behalf \u201cbe applied to the satisfaction of . . . Rothe\u2019s lien rights.\u201d On September 14, 1988, the trial court, pursuant to section 708.470, subdivisions (a) and (b), granted the motion and ruled that \u201cany judgment due to [Bertram] in this dissolution of marriage matter shall be applied to the satisfaction of the lien of judgment creditor. . . Rothe.\u201d</p>\n<p id=\"b1190-5\">In a declaration filed in the dissolution action, which was in the superior court file, Bertram claimed that all property acquired prior to the marriage was his separate property. He also claimed a community interest in a single family residence under construction and a single family residence held in the name of Joyce and her daughter from a previous marriage which Joyce claimed as her separate property. Joyce claimed in her \u201cCommunity &amp; Quasi-Community Property Declaration\u201d which was dated August 16, 1985, that the community had assets in excess of $17 million.</p>\n<p id=\"b1191-4\"><page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"1715\">*1715</page-number>On March 15, 1989, Joyce and Bertram filed a \u201cFurther Judgment on Reserved Issues Pursuant to Stipulation\u201d (Further Judgment) in the dissolution action. The Further Judgment provided for settlement of disputes including property, support, and custody of minor children.<footnotemark>3</footnotemark> It provided in part that <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"1716\">*1716</page-number>Joyce would receive an equalizing cash payment of $1,550,000 from various stocks and accounts. On April 25, 1989, the parties filed a document entitled \u201cStipulation Re Termination of Restraining Order, For Distribution of Assets, and Order Thereon\u201d (the Stipulation) which provided that Joyce would receive from Bertram an \u201cequalizing cash payment of $599,673.90.\u201d<footnotemark>4</footnotemark> The Further Judgment referred to property Joyce declared under oath was community property in her aforementioned declaration dated September 25, 1985. Some of that property was conveyed to Bertram to be his separate property. There was no evidence that Rothe\u2019s counsel was served with copies of the Further Judgment or the Stipulation prior to their filing.</p>\n<p id=\"b1192-4\">On October 4, 1989, Rothe filed a motion for an order enforcing his judgment lien pursuant to sections 708.410-708.480 against Joyce. As noted previously, Rothe had secured a judgment lien in compliance with section 708.410, subdivisions (a) and (b), against Bertram on September 14, 1988. Joyce opposed the motion for imposition of Rothe\u2019s judgment against her on the ground that she had not transferred any property to Bertram in the settlement of the dissolution action which had been subject to the judgment lien against Bertram entered on September 14, 1988.</p>\n<p id=\"b1193-4\"><page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"1717\">*1717</page-number>At the hearing on the motion on October 25, 1989, the court denied a request for continuance by \u201cspecially appearing\u201d counsel on behalf of Bertram. Prior to argument, Joyce\u2019s counsel orally requested a jury trial, an evidentiary hearing, and a statement of decision. The trial court denied the requests for jury trial and an evidentiary hearing. The court then granted the motion pursuant to section 708.470, subdivision (c). With respect to the request for statement of decision, the court stated that it would only give an oral statement of decision. The court found that \u201cthe facts from the file\u2014the declaration indicates that a substantial transfer of assets far in excess of the amount of the judgment sought here, there\u2019s been over a million dollars transferred, that this is an appropriate case.\u201d On November 9, 1989, 15 days after the hearing, Joyce filed written objections to the sufficiency of the oral statement of decision claiming that she could not determine on what basis: the court found a transfer from Joyce to Bertram; Joyce had any interest in any of the property received by Bertram; and the value of Joyce\u2019s interest in property received by Bertram. Joyce also objected because the oral statement of decision failed to explain why the court in ruling on the judgment lien motion concluded that the settlement of the marital dissolution action was not court supervised. The court entered judgment in favor of Rothe and against Joyce on November 29,1989, in the sum of $123,807.87. Joyce filed a timely notice of appeal.</p>\n<p id=\"b1193-5\">III. Discussion</p>\n<p id=\"b1193-6\">A. <em>Joyce has waived any objection to the statement of decision</em></p>\n<p id=\"b1193-7\">Joyce claims that the trial court committed reversible error in relying on its oral decision as the statement of decision. Joyce is not entitled to a reversal on this issue pursuant to the express provisions of section 632.<footnotemark>5</footnotemark> Under this section, the trial court was entitled to give an oral statement of decision since the hearing was concluded within one calendar day. Joyce <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"1718\">*1718</page-number>claims, however, that the oral statement was insufficient since it failed to address the specific controverted issues in this case. There are two problems with Joyce\u2019s argument. The first is that Joyce, through her counsel, did not comply with section 632 since she did not \u201cspecify those controverted issues as to which [she was] requesting a statement of decision\u201d until 15 days after the hearing on the motion and after the trial court announced its statement of decision. Section 632 provides, \u201cThe request must be made within 10 days after the court announces a tentative decision unless the trial is concluded within one calendar day or in less than eight hours over more than one day in which event the request must be made prior to the submission of the matter for decision.\u201d It is only error when the trial court refuses to explain the factual and legal basis for a decision as to the principal controverted issues when there is a <em>timely </em>request. <em>(Laws </em>v. <em>County of San Diego </em>(1990) 219 Cal.App.3d 189, 197 [267 Cal.Rptr. 921].) Therefore, although Joyce, through her attorney, requested a statement of decision which discussed certain issues, she did not timely comply with section 632 and she cannot claim that the statement was insufficient.</p>\n<p id=\"b1194-4\">B. <em>There was a transfer of property</em></p>\n<p id=\"b1194-5\">This case involves the effort by a judgment creditor to recover the amount due to him under an existing judgment by means of a judgment lien in an action in which the judgment debtor was a party. Prior to 1941, a judgment creditor could not secure a judgment lien in a lawsuit where the judgment debtor potentially could recover a judgment. Rather, a judgment creditor would \u201clevy execution upon and sell a pending cause of action in which [the] judgment debtor was [a] plaintiff.\u201d <em>(Roseburg Loggers, Inc. </em>v. <em>U.S. Plywood-Champion Papers, Inc. </em>(1975) 14 Cal.3d 742, 746 [122 Cal.Rptr. 567, 537 P.2d 399].) The problem with the pre-1941 procedure was that \u201ca cause of action upon which an action [was] pending [did] not bring very much on execution sale . . . .\u201d <em>(The Work of the California 1941 Legislature </em>(1941) 15 U.So.Cal.L. Rev. 1, 18.) In 1941, former Code of Civil Procedure section 688.1, which provided for a judgment lien against a judgment debtor, was enacted (Stats. 1941, ch. 1148, \u00a7 2, pp. 2856-2857) and was later amended on several occasions. (Stats. 1943, ch. 94, \u00a7 1, p. 799; Stats. 1951, ch. 1737, \u00a7 105, pp. 4121-4122; Stats. 1968, ch. 1036, \u00a7 1, pp. 2001-2002; Stats. 1970, ch. 1245, \u00a7 1, pp. 2235-2236; Stats. 1970, ch. 1523,\u00a7 7.5, pp. 3069-3070.)<footnotemark>6</footnotemark> <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"1719\">*1719</page-number>Prior to 1982, former section 688.1 in all of its versions was described as \u201cremedial in nature and should be liberally construed to give effect to the remedy which it authorizes.\u201d <em>(McClearen </em>v. <em>Superior Court </em>(1955) 45 Cal.2d 852, 856 [291 P.2d 449].) Among the purposes of former section 688.1 were the elimination of the dangers of a judgment creditor receiving less than the full value of the judgment debtor\u2019s recovery and to \u201cprotect the judgment creditor against the debtor entering into a collusive agreement with his [or her] debtor to deprive the judgment creditor of resort to the cause of action or judgment of the judgment debtor.\u201d <em>(Takehara </em>v. <em>H.C. Muddox Co. </em>(1972) 8 Cal.3d 168, 172 [104 Cal.Rptr. 345, 501 P.2d 913].)</p>\n<p id=\"b1195-5\">In 1982, the Legislature enacted the Enforcement of Judgments Law. (Stats. 1982, ch. 1364, \u00a7\u00a7 1-7, pp. 5070-5237.) This massive recodification and modification of statutes relating to postjudgment enforcement proceedings was in response to an October 1980 recommendation of the California Law Revision Commission. (Tent. Recommendation Proposing the Enforcement of Judgments Law (Oct. 1980) 15 Cal. Law. Revision Com. Rep. (1980) pp. 2001-2686; Assem. Com. on Judiciary, Rep. on Assem. Bill No. 707 (1982 Reg. Sess.) p. 1.) Section 688.1 was recodified as sections 708.410-708.480.<footnotemark>7</footnotemark> The provisions of sections 708.410-708.480, which replaced former section 688.1, set forth the procedure to be followed by a judgment creditor in securing a lien on a cause of action or other claim. A judgment creditor files and serves a copy of a notice of lien on all of the parties to the \u201caction or special proceeding . . . .\u201d<footnotemark>8</footnotemark> (\u00a7 708.410, subd. (a).) After the notice of lien is served, the judgment creditor may secure an order by way of a motion that applies money or property that the judgment debtor <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"1720\">*1720</page-number>is entitled to in the \u201caction or special proceeding\u201d to the satisfaction of the judgment creditor\u2019s judgment. (\u00a7 708.470, subds. (a) &amp; (b); 2 Debt Collection Practice in Cal. (Cont.Ed.Bar 1987) \u00a7 8.48, p. 616; 8 Witkin, Cal. Procedure (3d ed. 1985) Enforcement of Judgment, \u00a7 297, p. 257.) In the case at bar, Rothe secured such an order on September 14, 1988, which directed that \u201cany judgment due to [Bertram] in this dissolution of marriage matter shall be applied to the satisfaction of the lien of judgment creditor . . . Rothe.\u201d The September 14, 1988, order was issued pursuant to section 708.470, subdivisions (a) and (b).</p>\n<p id=\"b1196-4\">After the filing of the Further Judgment on March 15, 1989, and the Stipulation on April 25, 1989, pursuant to section 708.470, subdivision (c), Rothe sought to assert his rights against Joyce as a transferor of property subject to his judgment lien on any property or money to be transferred to Rothe in the action.</p>\n<p id=\"b1196-5\">As noted previously, section 708.470, subdivision (c) provides: \u201cIf the court determines that a party (other than the judgment debtor) having notice of the lien created under this article has transferred property that was subject to the lien or has paid an amount to the judgment debtor that was subject to the lien, the court shall render judgment against the party in an amount equal to the lesser of the following: [ft] (1) The value of the judgment debtor\u2019s interest in the property or the amount paid to the judgment debtor, [ft] (2) The amount of the judgment creditor\u2019s lien created under this article.\u201d  Section 708.470, subdivision (c) thereby allows a judgment creditor such as Rothe to obtain a judgment against a person such as Joyce who has transferred assets subject to a lien created pursuant to section 708.410 to a judgment debtor such as Bertram. (16 Cal.Jur,3d, pt. 2, Creditors\u2019 Rights and Remedies, \u00a7 234, pp. 317-318.) The same considerations of liberal construction and legislative purposes that applied to former section 688.1 in its various versions control judicial resolution of motions brought pursuant to section 708.470, subdivision (c). <em>(In re Marriage of Kerr </em>(1986)) 185 Cal.App.3d 130, 134 [229 Cal.Rptr. 610].) Section 708.470 may be applied to family law proceedings. <em>(Ibid.; 4 </em>Markey, Cal. Family Law (1991) \u00a7 50.45, pp. 50-140.16-50.140.17; 2 Cal. Marital Dissolution Practice (Cont.Ed.Bar 1983) \u00a7 23.91, p. 960; 2 Cal. Marital Dissolution Practice (Cont.Ed.Bar 1991 Supp.) \u00a7 23.91, 214.)</p>\n<p id=\"b1196-6\">Joyce contends that the judgment must be reversed because there was no evidence that the division of the property pursuant to the Further Judgment and the Stipulation amounted to a <em>transfer </em>of property within the meaning of section 708.470, subdivision (c). Transfer of property is not <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"1721\">*1721</page-number>defined in section 708.470.  However, Civil Code section 1039 defines a transfer as \u201can act of the parties, or of the law, by which the title to property is conveyed from one living person to another.\u201d The Supreme Court has noted: \u201cIn legal phraseology it is commonly used to denote the passing of title in property, usually realty, or an interest therein from one person to another. [Citations.] . . . [W]hile the word \u2018transfer\u2019 as used in the Civil Code indicates the passing of title from one person to another, in its ordinary use it has a very general meaning, including the removal of a thing from one place to another, the changing of its control or possession or conveyance of title to it.\u201d <em>(Commercial Discount Co. </em>v. <em>Cowen </em>(1941) 18 Cal.2d 610, 614 [116 P.2d 599].)  We conclude that substantial evidence supports the finding that Joyce transferred property to Bertram which was subject to the lien imposed on September 14, 1987.</p>\n<p id=\"b1197-5\">There is substantial evidence that the monies and property transferred to Joyce under the Further Judgment filed March 15, 1989, and the Stipulation filed April 25, 1989, were to equalize property transferred to Bertram which were subject to Rothe\u2019s lien rights. Rothe\u2019s moving papers filed on October 4, 1989, in which he sought to impose a judgment lien on Joyce\u2019s share of the moneys and property given to her under the terms of the Further Judgment and the Stipulation were based upon the pleadings, records, and files in the present case. One of the documents in the superior court file was Joyce\u2019s \u201cCommunity &amp; Quasi-Community Property Declaration.\u201d In that under-oath submission, she identified millions of dollars of equity in real estate, furniture, securities, and other accounts and listed all of that as community property. For example, Joyce claimed a commercial building at 6849 Hayvenhurst in Van Nuys as community property and assigned it a net value of $1.2 million. This building was conveyed to Bertram pursuant to the Further Judgment filed March 15, 1989. The two <em>equalizing </em>payments totalling $2,149,673.90 paid pursuant to the Further Judgment and the Stipulation were to compensate Joyce for her share of the community property. The equalizing payments or the 6849 Hayvenhurst property both had values far in excess of the $123,807.87 judgment imposed against Joyce and in favor of Rothe.</p>\n<p id=\"b1197-6\">Based upon this evidence, the trial court could reasonably conclude that Joyce, with full knowledge of Rothe\u2019s lien rights, transferred to Bertram more than one-half of the undivided community property interest held jointly by Bertram and herself and, in return, received over $2 million. This transfer of community property to Bertram as his separate property gives rise to a liability on her part pursuant to section 708.470, subdivision (c). The fair inference to draw from the fact that Joyce received over $2 million in equalizing payments was that the money was to \u201cequalize\u201d her portion of the <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"1722\">*1722</page-number>division of the community property assets. When she exercised her right of joint control over the community assets (Civ. Code, \u00a7 5125; <em>People </em>v. <em>Kahanic </em>(1987) 196 Cal.App.3d 461, 466 [241 Cal.Rptr. 722]; Hogoboom &amp; King, Cal. Practice Family Law Guide (1991) \u00a7 8.145, p. 8-116) and conveyed a share to Bertram as his sole property pursuant to the Further Judgment and the Stipulation in return for in excess of $2 million, she incurred liability for that transfer pursuant to section 708.470, subdivision (c).<footnotemark>9</footnotemark> As previously noted, in <em>Commercial Discount Co. </em>v. <em>Cowen, supra, </em>18 Cal.2d at page 614, the Supreme Court defined the term \u201ctransfer\u201d as used in Civil Code section 1039 as an event where title passes from one person to another or there is a change in the right to control property. In the present case, title to jointly held community property became Bertram\u2019s separate property which was no longer subject to the joint control of Bertram and Joyce.</p>\n<p id=\"b1198-4\">Joyce argues that all the properties and moneys awarded to Bertram were not community assets. To begin with, the sole evidence on this subject was Joyce\u2019s own attorney\u2019s conclusory declaration premised principally upon hearsay. The problem was that her attorney\u2019s conclusory declaration was contradicted by Joyce\u2019s own community property declaration which identified specific property having a value well in excess of $1 million which was later transferred to Bertram as well as the inferences to be drawn from the Further Judgment and the Stipulation. As an appellate court, we may not reweigh the conflicting evidence. <em>(Crawford </em>v. <em>Southern Pacific Co. </em>(1935) 3 Cal.2d 427, 429 [45 P.2d 183]; <em>Minelian </em>v. <em>Manzella </em>(1989) 215 Cal.App.3d 457, 463 [263 Cal.Rptr. 597].) In conclusion, there was substantial evidence of a transfer within the meaning of section 708.470, subdivision (c).</p>\n<p id=\"b1198-5\">C. <em>The trial court did not abuse its discretion in denying the motions made on the date of the. </em>hearing<footnotemark>*</footnotemark></p>\n<p id=\"b1199-4\"><page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"1723\">*1723</page-number>IV.
