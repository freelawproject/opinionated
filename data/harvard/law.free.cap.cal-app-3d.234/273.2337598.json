Code,<footnotemark>1</footnotemark> \u00a7 187). Appellant was also charged as an accessory to the same murder (\u00a7 32). The jury returned verdicts finding both appellant and Bobby guilty of second degree murder and finding appellant guilty as an accessory. Appellant was sentenced to a term of 15 <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"276\">*276</page-number>years to life on the murder count. His midterm sentence of two years on the accessory count was stayed by the sentencing court per section 654.</p>\n<p id=\"b260-4\">In the published portion of this opinion we will agree with appellant\u2019s claim that the court committed prejudicial error when it denied his motion for separate trials and allowed use of a redacted version of appellant\u2019s postarrest statement without permitting appellant to present portions of the statement which tended to exculpate him from responsibility for the murder. For that reason we will reverse the murder conviction. In the unpublished portion of the opinion we will reject appellant\u2019s other contentions except one. Respondent concedes, and we agree, that appellant cannot ultimately stand convicted of both murder and of being an accessory to that murder.</p>\n<p id=\"b260-5\">Facts</p>\n<p id=\"b260-6\">On January 15, 1989, Angela B. was released from juvenile hall. Angela\u2019s boyfriend, codefendant Bobby Douglas, along with appellant (Bobby\u2019s brother), picked her up from her mother\u2019s house that evening and brought her back to their house where they smoked about $40 worth of rock cocaine. Angela stayed the night there. The electricity was off at the Douglas house, and a small number of lights and appliances, including a swag lamp in the living room/dining room area, were being powered through an orange extension cord running from a neighbor\u2019s home.</p>\n<p id=\"b260-7\">The following morning, Angela, appellant, Bobby and a third Douglas brother, J., drove into Fresno to go to a department store where they exchanged a pair of tennis shoes for about $70 or $80. In turn they stole another pair of shoes, which they took to another store and again exchanged for cash. The trip netted them about $120 or $140.</p>\n<p id=\"b260-8\">The four drove back to Madera and stopped at Will Dawson\u2019s home where about 4:30 p.m. they purchased about five rocks of rock cocaine. Returning to the Douglas house, Angela, appellant and Bobby smoked all of the newly purchased cocaine; J. did not participate (nor did he participate in any subsequent drug consumption). By 6 p.m. the cocaine was gone.</p>\n<p id=\"b260-9\">Appellant left to purchase more cocaine; Angela testified she thought he again purchased it from Dawson. He returned with about $40 worth which he, Bobby, and Angela smoked immediately. Appellant again left to get more, this time expressly stating he was obtaining it from Dawson. As he was now out of money, he was only able to get about $20 worth \u201cup front\u201d from Dawson, i.e., on credit. Appellant, Bobby and Angela smoked it all. When they finished at 10:30 or 11, appellant took a pair of shoes to Dawson <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"277\">*277</page-number>and traded them for three rocks, which he brought home. Again, appellant, Bobby and Angela smoked it all. At some point, J. fell asleep on the couch.</p>\n<p id=\"b261-5\">About 1 or 1:30 on the morning of January 17, the three wanted still more cocaine. Dawson\u2019s wife forbade additional noncash transactions, however, so another source was needed. It was known by Angela and the two brothers that Lloyd Amey dealt in rock cocaine and that he was willing to trade it for leather jackets. Bobby indicated to Angela that they had leather jackets to exchange and that they would call Amey. Angela did not know about any leather jackets, however, and began to fear that something was going wrong. Appellant and Bobby talked about killing Amey, but Angela did not take the discussion seriously as they were all high and laughing.</p>\n<p id=\"b261-6\">Appellant placed a telephone call to Amey, pretending to be Bobby, and insisting that Amey come to the Douglas house to make the exchange. Bobby and Angela sat on the floor next to the fireplace while appellant walked around the house; then Angela heard a car pull up. Appellant went out through a door in the kitchen to the garage area which had been converted into a room; he left the door open. Bobby followed some minutes later. Angela could hear three people in the converted garage area and then heard loud noises, \u201clike a fight going on.\u201d She heard Amey\u2019s voice saying, \u201cWhy? Why? I thought you were my friend. Leave me alone. Take my drugs, leave me alone.\u201d She saw the shadow of an arm holding a knife going up and down. She was so frightened she urinated in her pants. She hid in the bathroom.</p>\n<p id=\"b261-7\">A noise woke J. who had been asleep on the couch. He heard a voice in the garage area saying \u201cNo, please\u201d and \u201cPlease help.\u201d J. ran to the door to the garage area and saw someone \u201cswinging.\u201d He joined Angela in the bathroom; she described him as \u201cscared, hysterical, same as me.\u201d</p>\n<p id=\"b261-8\">The sounds died down and the only light in the house went out. Some five minutes later, still in the bathroom, Angela saw the light come back on. Angela later learned that the extension cord had been cut, and the light and appliance cords had to be respliced into the cord. She came out to the fireplace and saw Bobby come back into the house from the converted garage; he looked pale and bloody. There was blood all over his clothing; \u201cHe looked like somebody just came out of a war zone.\u201d J. was seated on the couch, and Bobby told J. to take off his clothes and put on some sweats. When J. got out of his clothes, Bobby removed his own clothing, put on J.\u2019s pants, and tossed his bloody clothes into the fireplace. He also burned Amey\u2019s wallet.</p>\n<p id=\"b261-9\">While Bobby\u2019s clothes were burning, appellant came in from the garage and told J. something, but Angela could not remember what it was. It may <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"278\">*278</page-number>have been a directive for J. to open Amey\u2019s car door. J. testified that at one point he heard a man\u2019s voice say \u201cGo open the car door,\u201d and he went outside and opened one of the rear doors of the car. Appellant had \u201ca little\u201d blood on his clothing. He was pale and tense and had a kitchen knife in his hand.</p>\n<p id=\"b262-4\">Appellant told Angela and J. to get some blankets but Angela did not comply, and when she saw appellant with blankets she assumed he had found them himself. At some point, appellant threatened to hurt J. and Angela if they told the police anything. Bobby also threatened them.</p>\n<p id=\"b262-5\">From a window, Angela saw appellant and Bobby carrying Amey\u2019s body to his car. Thereafter, appellant drove away in Amey\u2019s car and was gone for some 10 minutes. When he returned, he cleaned up the garage area, using bleach and paint. Appellant came back into the house, and he, Bobby, and Angela smoked more rock cocaine. Angela presumed it to be Amey\u2019s cocaine as one of the two bottles was broken and there was blood on them. Angela asked Bobby what happened. He did not answer.</p>\n<p id=\"b262-6\">After they finished smoking the cocaine, Angela called for a taxi. All four took the cab to Angela\u2019s sister\u2019s home to see if they could stay the rest of the night. Her sister refused to allow appellant, Bobby, or J. to stay but did loan Angela some money to pay for the taxi. The four then walked to Angela\u2019s mother\u2019s house and spent the rest of the night in Angela\u2019s bedroom.</p>\n<p id=\"b262-7\">J. and appellant appeared to be asleep on the bed but Angela and Bobby sat and talked. Angela again asked Bobby to tell her what had happened. He said he did not know why he did it.</p>\n<p id=\"b262-8\">While in her bedroom, Angela learned from either appellant or Bobby that they had taken Amey\u2019s rings and they wanted Angela to pawn them, as she had California identification.</p>\n<p id=\"b262-9\">Shortly after 8 o\u2019clock on the morning of January 17, Madera Sheriff\u2019s Sergeant Larry Elmore was dispatched to an open field in the Parkwood area of Madera where he found Amey\u2019s late-model car parked, its rear doors open. Amey\u2019s bloody body was in the backseat, wrapped in blankets and an orange electrical cord. A gravel-like substance, apparently cat box filler, was mixed with the blood on Amey\u2019s face and clothing.</p>\n<p id=\"b262-10\">An autopsy was conducted. The pathologist found some 24 stab wounds, 4 of which were potentially lethal. The scattered locations of the wounds around Amey\u2019s body, and the varying depths and widths of the wounds, suggested to the pathologist that more than one assailant was involved.</p>\n<p id=\"b263-4\"><page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"279\">*279</page-number>Early that afternoon, Sergeant Elmore received a call from Robert Miller who indicated he had information about where Amey was killed. Elmore and Detective Esteves picked up Miller who pointed out the Douglas house to them. After dropping off Miller, Elmore and Esteves drove back to the Douglas house where they observed appellant and Bobby standing outside.</p>\n<p id=\"b263-5\">The officers stopped and approached appellant and Bobby. After establishing that they both lived at the house, Elmore and Esteves asked them about the orange extension cord running from the neighbor\u2019s house to theirs; Elmore had noted its similarity to the cord found wrapped around Amey. One of the brothers explained that their electricity had been turned off and the neighbor was permitting them to \u201cborrow\u201d electricity. Appellant voluntarily invited Esteves inside to show him where the cord went. After a few minutes, Bobby went inside as well, and a short time later Esteves came out and told Elmore he should go in and look at something.</p>\n<p id=\"b263-6\">Elmore entered and noticed the television and light cords spliced into the orange extension cord in the living and dining room. He followed the cord to the converted garage where he noticed a large patch of wet paint on the carpeting; it had a pinkish tint to it, though the paint still in the bucket was white. Paint had been brushed onto a sofa and a clothes washer or dryer. Near the door was a cat box with a small amount of filler in it. A power saw was partially concealed in a pile of clothing; what appeared to be blood could be seen on the saw\u2019s body and cord. Elmore concluded he was in the location where Amey had been killed.</p>\n<p id=\"b263-7\">Appellant was interviewed that afternoon by Detective Louie Beard. After waiving his <em>Miranda </em>rights <em>(Miranda </em>v. <em>Arizona </em>(1966) 384 U.S. 436 [16 L.Ed.2d 694, 86 S.Ct. 1602, 10 A.L.R.3d 974]), appellant talked to Beard about the homicide for nearly an hour. That statement, redacted per <em>People </em>v. <em>Aranda </em>(1965) 63 Cal.2d 518 [47 Cal.Rptr. 353, 407 P.2d 265], was related to the jury by Beard.</p>\n<p id=\"b263-8\">According to Beard, appellant admitted that a telephone call was placed to Amey to exchange jackets for rock cocaine. Amey arrived in his car shortly thereafter, pulling into the driveway. Appellant went out to greet him, and when Amey entered the converted garage he was stabbed. Appellant did not admit to actually stabbing Amey. Amey expressed surprise and puzzlement, saying \u201cTake the drugs, take the drugs.\u201d During the killing, appellant saw Angela standing in the doorway, screaming hysterically; he mentioned that she had urinated in her pants. Likewise he stated that J. saw the body after the killing and that he pushed him away from the doorway. J. became ill at the sight.</p>\n<p id=\"b264-3\"><page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"280\">*280</page-number>Appellant told Beard that Amey\u2019s wallet and rings were taken; the wallet was burned, the rings stashed in the house. About $100 worth of rock cocaine was also removed from Amey\u2019s body and was subsequently smoked. Appellant placed a butcher knife in the sink. He also mentioned the presence of another knife. Both knives were used on Amey. Appellant admitted wrapping Amey\u2019s body in more than one blanket. The body got tangled in the extension cord, and appellant cut the cord, leaving a portion wrapped around the body; he spliced the remaining cord later. He removed Amey\u2019s body from the house about 1 or 1:30 a.m. J. opened the car door. Appellant then drove Amey\u2019s vehicle away, returned, and cleaned up the scene of the killing with paint and bleach. He disposed of his tennis shoes, either in the garage area or in the fire. He observed clothing burning in the fireplace.</p>\n<p id=\"b264-4\">Later that day, after the interviews were completed, appellant and J. were taken back to the house by Elmore. The brothers showed Elmore where three yellow-metal rings taken from Amey had been hidden.</p>\n<p id=\"b264-5\">Discussion</p>\n<p id=\"b264-6\">I. <em>Denial of Appellant\u2019s Motion to Exclude His Confession Did Not Violate His Right to Due </em>Process.<footnotemark>*</footnotemark></p>\n<p id=\"b264-7\">II. <em>The Trial Court Erred in Denying Appellant\u2019s Severance Motion.</em></p>\n<p id=\"b264-8\">Appellant made a pretrial motion to sever his trial from that of his brother Bobby. The court twice denied the motion. Appellant contends this was error.</p>\n<p id=\"b264-9\">The first motion for severance was made on grounds unrelated to the issue raised on appeal. The court allowed appellant to renew the motion the day before trial commenced and heard it in connection with motions in limine. At this hearing the primary issue discussed revolved around appellant\u2019s confession, which the prosecution wished to use in a \u201csanitized\u201d form. (See <em>People </em>v. <em>Aranda, supra, </em>63 Cal.2d 518.) Appellant\u2019s trial counsel expressly argued that a redacted version of appellant\u2019s statement, deleting portions which were exculpatory as to appellant but inculpatory as to Bobby, could prejudice appellant. Counsel fiirther stated her intention to question Beard about the exculpatory portions of appellant\u2019s statement.</p>\n<p id=\"b265-4\"><page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"281\">*281</page-number>The court admonished Beard that in referring to appellant\u2019s statement \u201cyou should make references only to what Thomas Douglas did, not necessarily what Bobby did.\u201d The court did not, however, request a verbatim version of the \u201csanitized\u201d statement the prosecutor proposed to offer. Nor did it inquire further into appellant\u2019s claim of prejudice. The court expressed \u201cserious doubts\u201d that the exculpatory portions of the statement could be received in evidence as admissions, but again denied the severance motion.</p>\n<p id=\"b265-5\">During trial, the prosecution offered Beard\u2019s testimony as to portions of appellant\u2019s interrogation statement. The court admonished the jury that the statement was admissible and was to be considered \u201conly as against Tommy.\u201d Appellant\u2019s attorney attempted to cross-examine Beard regarding redacted portions of the confession. Bobby\u2019s counsel interposed hearsay objections to many of appellant\u2019s questions. The court sustained several objections but overruled others.</p>\n<p id=\"b265-6\">Penal Code section 1098 provides in pertinent part:</p>\n<blockquote id=\"b265-7\">\u201cWhen two or more defendants are jointly charged with any public offense, whether felony or misdemeanor, they must be tried jointly, unless the court order separate trials. . . .\u201d</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b265-8\">\u201cThe Legislature has in this manner expressed a preference for joint trials. [Citations.] The statute nevertheless permits the trial court to order separate trials, and the decision to do so is one \u2018largely within the discretion of the trial court.\u2019 [Citations.] Whether denial of a motion to sever constitutes an abuse of discretion must be decided on the facts as they appear at the time of the hearing on the motion to sever. [Citation.]\u201d <em>(People </em>v. <em>Boyde </em>(1988) 46 Cal.3d 212, 231-232 [250 Cal.Rptr. 83, 758 P.2d 25].)</blockquote>\n<p id=\"b265-9\">In <em>People </em>v. <em>Aranda, supra, </em>63 Cal.2d 518, the Supreme Court laid down \u201cjudicially declared rules of practice\u201d for the implementation of section 1098 when one defendant\u2019s confession is to be admitted at a joint trial.</p>\n<p id=\"b265-10\">\u201cWhen the prosecution proposes to introduce into evidence an extrajudicial statement of one defendant that implicates a codefendant, the trial court must adopt one of the following procedures: (1) It can permit a joint trial if all parts of the extrajudicial statements implicating any codefendants can be and are effectively deleted <em>without prejudice to the declarant. </em>By effective deletions, we mean not only direct and indirect identifications of codefendants but any statements that could be employed against nondeclarant codefendants once their identity is otherwise established. (2) It can grant a severance of trials if the prosecution insists that it must use the extrajudicial <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"282\">*282</page-number>statements and it appears that effective deletions cannot be made. (3) If the prosecution has successfully resisted a motion for severance and thereafter offers an extrajudicial statement implicating a codefendant, the trial court must exclude it if effective deletions are not possible.\u201d (63 Cal.2d at pp. 530-531, fn. omitted, italics added.)</p>\n<p id=\"b266-4\">In <em>Bruton </em>v. <em>United States </em>(1968) 391 U.S. 123 [20 L.Ed.2d 476, 88 S.Ct. 1620], the United States Supreme Court held that use of a codefendant\u2019s confession inculpating the defendant in a joint trial violates the nonconfessing defendant\u2019s right of cross-examination secured by the confrontation clause of the Sixth Amendment. The violation is not cured by a jury instruction that the confession should be disregarded in determining the nonconfessing defendant\u2019s guilt or innocence. <em>(Id. </em>at p. 137 [20 L.Ed.2d at p. 485].)</p>\n<p id=\"b266-5\">In this case the court was presented with an extrajudicial statement by appellant implicating Bobby and was told that the prosecution intended to introduce that statement against appellant. The court permitted a joint trial on condition that Beard delete any references to Bobby in recounting the statement. What the court failed to do, however, was first ascertain \u201cif all parts of the extrajudicial statements implicating [Bobby] [could] be and [were] effectively deleted <em>without prejudice to [appellant].\u201d (Aranda, supra, </em>62 Cal.2d at p. 530, italics added.) Although the court specifically found that insufficient evidence had been presented to show a prejudicial effect to either defendant, it did so without knowing exactly how appellant\u2019s statement would be edited by the prosecution and Beard. The prosecutor did not offer a transcript or other record of the redacted statement, and the court did not request one.</p>\n<p id=\"b266-6\">Appellant amply demonstrates the significance of this failure. When Beard testified as to the content of appellant\u2019s interrogation, some answers were misleading. For instance, during the interrogation appellant specifically stated at least twice that Bobby placed the telephone call to Amey. Beard\u2019s testimony on this point, however, was:</p>\n<blockquote id=\"b266-7\">\u201cQ. Can you summarize what he [appellant] said about his [appellant\u2019s] involvement in the homicide?</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b266-8\">\u201cA. Indicated a phone call was placed to Mr. Amey.\u201d</blockquote>\n<p id=\"b266-9\">Beard\u2019s answer to the question calling for what appellant said about his own involvement in the killing completely distorted appellant\u2019s actual statement by unequivocally implying that appellant admitted making the call himself. That implication was strengthened by the court\u2019s admonition that the statement could be considered \u201conly as against Tommy.\u201d</p>\n<p id=\"b267-4\"><page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"283\">*283</page-number>Similarly, during the interrogation appellant told Beard Bobby went outside to greet Amey and appellant was on his way out to join them when he heard Amey crying out after the stabbing began; he then ran back inside and pushed J. away from the door. While at other points he indicated he actually saw Bobby stab Amey, the clear implication of his statement is that Bobby, not appellant, went out to greet Amey. At trial, however, Beard\u2019s version contradicted what appellant actually said:</p>\n<blockquote id=\"b267-5\">\u201cQ. Did he [appellant] say what he [appellant] did upon Lloyd Amey\u2019s arrival?</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b267-6\">\u201cA. That\u2014I believe he said he went out to greet Mr. Amey, or proceeded to the direction where Amey was coming to.\u201d</blockquote>\n<p id=\"b267-7\">Regarding knives, Beard\u2019s testimony was similarly misleading. Appellant told Beard that Bobby used two knives in the attack on Amey, employing a butcher knife to stab Amey in the torso and using a \u201cRambo-style\u201d knife on Amey\u2019s face. Appellant consistently denied stabbing Amey himself, only admitting to putting one or both knives in the sink afterward.</p>\n<p id=\"b267-8\">In relating appellant\u2019s story to the jury, Beard made the following statements:</p>\n<blockquote id=\"b267-9\">\u201cQ. What did he [appellant] describe doing with this butcher knife?</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b267-10\">\u201cA. Putting it in the sink.</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b267-11\">&lt;&lt;</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b267-12\">\u201cQ. Did he say he did anything with the butcher knife prior to putting it into the sink?</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b267-13\">\u201cA. I don\u2019t believe so.</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b267-14\">\u201cQ. Did he make reference to more than one knife, more than this butcher knife?</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b267-15\">\u201cA. Yes, he did.</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b267-16\">\u201cQ. How many knives did he make reference to?</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b267-17\">\u201cA. Two knives.</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b268-3\"><page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"284\">*284</page-number>\u201cQ. And did he indicate that one of the knives had been a butcher knife? \u201cA. Yes.</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b268-4\">\u201cQ. As far as the two knives that you earlier referred to, did he describe both of those knives having been used on Lloyd Amey?</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b268-5\">\u201cA. Yes.</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b268-6\">\u201cQ. Did he indicate to you which knife had caused the initial stab wound?</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b268-7\">\u201cA. Yes, indicated to me it was the butcher knife.</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b268-8\">\u201cQ. Did he give you a specific location where the initial stab wound had occurred?</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b268-9\">\u201cA. In the middle of the back upper shoulder blade area.</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b268-10\">\u201cQ. Concerning the second knife. Did he indicate to you where the second knife had been used on the victim?</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b268-11\">\u201cA. The facial area.\u201d</blockquote>\n<p id=\"b268-12\">With this testimony the jury knew that two knives were used in the attack on Amey and that appellant denied having done anything with <em>one </em>of the knives prior to putting them in the sink. Moreover, Beard\u2019s testimony clearly implied appellant told Beard that Angela and J. (the only others in the house) were uninvolved in the actual stabbing. The strong implication, then, is that appellant told Beard that he and Bobby each used a knife in the attack on Amey. The jury was not told that appellant repeatedly denied using either knife.</p>\n<p id=\"b268-13\">Appellant attempted to correct the misleading nature of Beard\u2019s testimony on cross-examination. He attempted to show that in his actual statement appellant denied using a knife or harming Amey in any way, denied making the telephone call to Amey, and expressed fear of Bobby. Each attempt was thwarted when the court sustained Bobby\u2019s hearsay objections.</p>\n<p id=\"b269-4\"><page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"285\">*285</page-number>As appellant points out, the court\u2019s evidentiary rulings during appellant\u2019s cross-examination of Beard were clearly erroneous under Evidence Code section 356.  It states that \u201cWhere part of an act, declaration, conversation, or writing is given in evidence by one party, the whole on the same subject may be inquired into by an adverse party; . . .\u201d (Evid. Code, \u00a7 356.) This rule applies to admissions and confessions in criminal cases <em>(People </em>v. <em>Crowl </em>(1938) 28 Cal.App.2d 299, 307-308 [82 P.2d 507]) and applies even if the omitted portions of the conversation are self-serving <em>(People </em>v. <em>Hansen </em>(1933) 130 Cal.App. 217, 220 [19 P.2d 993]; see <em>Rosenberg </em>v. <em>Wittenborn </em>(1960) 178 Cal.App.2d 846, 851-853 [3 Cal.Rptr. 459].)</p>\n<p id=\"b269-5\">\u201cIt is an elementary rule of law that when admissions of one on trial for the commission of a criminal offense are allowed in evidence against him, all that he said in that connection must also be permitted to go to the jury, either through cross-examination of the witness who testified to the admissions or through witnesses produced by the accused. The fact that declarations made by the accused were self-serving does not preclude their introduction in evidence as a part of his whole statement, provided they are relevant to, and were made on the same occasion as the statements introduced by, the prosecution.\u201d (29 Am.Jur.2d, Evidence, \u00a7 599, pp. 654-655, fns. omitted.)</p>\n<p id=\"b269-6\">By denying appellant\u2019s severance motion without thoroughly inquiring into the content of the \u201csanitized\u201d statement to be offered against appellant, and without fully considering the prejudice to appellant inherent in redacting his statement, the court set the stage for an inevitable collision between Bobby\u2019s constitutional rights protected by the <em>Aranda/Bruton </em>decisions and appellant\u2019s right to have the jury hear his entire statement as provided in Evidence Code section 356. While <em>Aranda </em>offers as an option the redaction of the confession, it expressly limits that option to cases in which deletions are made without prejudice to the declarant. (63 Cal.2d at p. 530.) When deletions cannot be made without prejudice to the declarant the court should either grant severance or exclude the statement. <em>(Id. </em>at p. 531.)</p>\n<p id=\"b269-7\">In <em>People </em>v. <em>Matola </em>(1968) 259 Cal.App.2d 686 [66 Cal.Rptr. 610], the court sagely commented on the need for early detection of risks involved in deleting portions of a codefendant\u2019s confession in order to avoid \u201cthe <em>Aranda </em>crunch\u201d at trial. <em>(Id. </em>at p. 688.) Although dealing with a claim of prejudice by the non-confessing defendant, the court recognized the risks of prejudice to the confessing defendant.</p>\n<p id=\"b269-8\">\u201cIn ruling upon a severance motion, the trial court must be alert at the outset to factors which are harbingers of editorial failure. If the parts of the <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"286\">*286</page-number>confession affecting a codefendant favor or may favor the confessing defendant, the deletion of those statements is not going to stick. The declarant\u2019s counsel will want to bring them out, either upon cross-examination of the person who testifies to the confession, or upon direct examination of the declarant if he takes the stand. <em>Were he prevented from bringing out evidence favorable to his declarant client, to protect the nondeclarant, the declarant would himself be prejudiced by the joint trial.</em></p>\n<p id=\"b270-4\">\u201cThe trial court in this case denied the motion to sever solely on the basis that the prosecuting attorney represented that the confession could and would be successfully edited. The trial court had no reason to doubt the prosecutor\u2019s good faith in so stating, but all the prosecutor could assure the court was that he himself would not offer the offending passages. His own restraint could not affect defense counsel\u2019s duty or strategy. <em>Had the trial court closely examined the confession, including the proposed excisions, the ineffectiveness of the prosecutor\u2019s assurance would have been evident. </em>The court prejudicially erred in denying the severance motion.\u201d (259 Cal.App.2d at pp. 692-693, italics added.)</p>\n<p id=\"b270-5\">We know of only a handful of California cases in which a confessing defendant claims on appeal that use of his or her redacted confession operated to his or her prejudice. In the most recent, <em>People </em>v. <em>Jackson </em>(1987) 192 Cal.App.3d 209 [237 Cal.Rptr. 373], the court found \u201cno error\u201d in the editing of a confession. The case is not particularly helpful here, however, because neither defendant moved for severance. <em>(Id. </em>at pp. 214-215.) Here appellant moved to sever, specifically arguing that he would otherwise have to attempt to introduce the deleted portions of his confession to avoid prejudice. The lower court nonetheless denied the severance motion.</p>\n<p id=\"b270-6\">In <em>People </em>v. <em>Tealer </em>(1975) 48 Cal.App.3d 598 [122 Cal.Rptr. 144], over a defense objection, the trial court allowed the prosecutor to use a sanitized version of defendant Tealer\u2019s post-arrest statement (\u201c \u2018We were just passing by the place and decided to rob it\u2019 \u201d) by substituting \u201cI\u201d for \u201cwe.\u201d <em>(Id. </em>at p. 601.) The appellate court held that the change was <em>Aranda </em>error because it threw \u201cthe entire onus of the planned robbery on defendant by converting the sometimes ambiguous and partially exculpatory \u2018we\u2019 into an unmistakable T.\u2019 \u201d (48 Cal.App.3d at pp. 603-604.) The court opined that the error, standing alone, might not have been prejudicial, but because it led to defendant\u2019s testimonial denial of making any statement, improper comment on that testimony by the prosecutor, and a jury instruction running afoul of <em>Griffin </em>v. <em>California </em>(1965) 380 U.S. 609 [14 L.Ed.2d 106, 85 S.Ct. 1229], reversal was required. Again, <em>Tealer </em>is not particularly instructive here because of the factual differences and because it does not appear the defendant there unsuccessfully moved for a separate trial.</p>\n<p id=\"b271-4\"><page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"287\">*287</page-number>In <em>People, </em>v. <em>Terry </em>(1970) 2 Cal.3d 362 [85 Cal.Rptr. 409, 466 P.2d 961], the trial court denied a pretrial severance motion. During trial<footnotemark>3</footnotemark> the court attempted to comply with <em>Aranda </em>by ordering that defendant Allen\u2019s confession should be sanitized by deleting all references to codefendant Terry. As the Supreme Court noted, \u201c[t]he result was somewhat ridiculous. [Allen\u2019s] confessions were read to the jury practically in their entirety, but everywhere the name \u2018Harold\u2019 (Terry) appeared, the word \u2018deleted\u2019 was substituted.\u201d (2 Cal.3d at pp. 384-385.) On appeal Allen complained this procedure was prejudicial to her.</p>\n<p id=\"b271-5\">\u201c. . . It is her view that the deletions distorted her confessions to her prejudice. She urges that since her defense was duress caused by fear of Terry, she was entitled to have the jury know that in her first confession she made reference to Terry having ordered her about during the two crimes. The later-admitted psychiatric testimony tended to show that she had a particular fear of Terry, not of \u2018Mr. Deleted.\u2019 Thus, so she claims, it was error to distort her confessions by removing all reference to Terry.\u201d (2 Cal.3d at p. 389.)</p>\n<p id=\"b271-6\">The Supreme Court gave short shrift to Allen\u2019s claim. It found no prejudice to Allen because \u201cit is impossible to believe that any reasonable person could have listened to [Allen\u2019s] confessions with the word \u2018Terry\u2019 stricken and the term \u2018deleted\u2019 inserted without knowing that the word \u2018deleted\u2019 referred to Terry.\u201d (2 Cal.3d at p. 389.)</p>\n<p id=\"b271-7\">By contrast, in our case the deletion of references to Bobby in appellant\u2019s statement clearly, and inaccurately, implied that appellant admitted his involvement in conduct he had explicitly disclaimed. Appellant was then improperly prevented from presenting evidence that his actual statement was exculpatory on major points. The prejudice to him is obvious and serious. If the court had granted the severance motion, deletions of appellant\u2019s statement would not have been required to protect Bobby under <em>Aranda/Bruton. </em>Because the evidence of appellant\u2019s involvement in the actual killing of Amey was far from overwhelming, we cannot dismiss this error as harmless. (See <em>People </em>v. <em>Massie </em>(1967) 66 Cal.2d 899, 921-924 [59 Cal.Rptr. 733, 428 P.2d 869].) Reversal of the murder conviction is required.</p>\n<p id=\"b271-8\">Appellant does not contend that the error affects his conviction for being an accessory, and we do not see how it could. Appellant freely and fully confessed to acts supporting the accessory conviction. None of the deletions</p>\n<p id=\"b272-3\"><page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"288\">*288</page-number>from his statement distorted its meaning as it affected his conduct after Amey\u2019s killing. The evidence of that conduct would not have differed significantly if produced at a separate trial. Thus, we conclude that the denial of the severance motion does not require reversal of the accessory conviction.</p>\n<p id=\"b272-4\">III.-V.<footnotemark>*</footnotemark></p>\n<p id=\"b272-5\">Disposition</p>\n<p id=\"b272-6\">The judgment of conviction of second degree murder is reversed. The judgment of conviction of being an accessory is affirmed. The cause is remanded for further proceedings consistent with this opinion. If, on remand, appellant is convicted of murder or a lesser included offense, the lower court shall, upon the judgment of such conviction becoming final, vacate the judgment of conviction for being an accessory. If appellant is not convicted of murder or a lesser included offense, the court shall resentence appellant on the accessory conviction.</p>\n<p id=\"b272-7\">Ardaiz, Acting P.
