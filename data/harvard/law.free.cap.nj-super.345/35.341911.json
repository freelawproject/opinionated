Following the denial of defendant\u2019s motion to suppress both a statement made to the police following his arrest and the knife used during the robbery, defendant was convicted at a trial by jury. He was sentenced to an extended term, as a persistent offender pursuant to <em>N.J.S.A. </em>2C:44-3a, of thirty-five years in the custody of the Commissioner of Corrections with an <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"37\">*37</page-number>85% period of parole ineligibility period pursuant to the No Early Release Act (\u201c\u00d1ERA\u201d), <em>N.J.S.A. </em>2C:43-7.2.<footnotemark>1</footnotemark></p>\n<p id=\"b71-6\">On the appeal defendant argues:</p>\n<blockquote id=\"b71-7\">POINT I THE DEFENDANT\u2019S RIGHT TO CONFRONT WITNESSES AS GUARANTEED BY THE SIXTH AMENDMENT TO THE <em>UNITED STATES CONSTITUTION </em>AND ART. 1 PAR. 10 OF THE <em>NEW JERSEY CONSTITUTION </em>AND THE DEFENDANT\u2019S RIGHT TO DUE PROCESS OF LAW AS GUARANTEED BY THE FOURTEENTH AMENDMENT TO THE <em>UNITED STATES CONSTITUTION </em>AND ART. 1 PAR. 1 OF THE <em>NEW JERSEY CONSTITUTION </em>WAS VIOLATED BY THE STATE\u2019S USE OF ABSENTEE WITNESSES TO PROVE ITS CASE (Not Raised Below)</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b71-8\">POINT II THE DEFENDANT\u2019S RIGHT TO DUE PROCESS OF LAW AS GUARANTEED BY THE FOURTEENTH AMENDMENT OF THE <em>UNITED STATES CONSTITUTION </em>AND ART. 1 PAR. 1 OF THE <em>NEW JERSEY CONSTITUTION </em>WAS VIOLATED BY THE TRIAL COURT\u2019S INCOMPLETE INSTRUCTION TO THE JURY ON THE LAW OF ORAL STATEMENTS (A <em>KOCIOLEK </em>CHARGE) NOTWITHSTANDING THE STATE\u2019S SUBSTANTIAL RELIANCE ON ORAL STATEMENTS TO PROVE ITS CASE (Not Raised Below)</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b71-9\">POINT III THE DEFENDANT\u2019S RIGHT TO DUE PROCESS OF LAW AS GUARANTEED BY THE FOURTEENTH AMENDMENT TO THE <em>UNITED STATES CONSTITUTION </em>AND ART. 1 PAR. 1 OF THE <em>NEW JERSEY CONSTITUTION </em>WAS VIOLATED WHEN THE STATE\u2019S LAY WITNESS RENDERED HIGHLY PREJUDICIAL OPINIONS THAT SHOULD HAVE BEEN EXCLUDED (Not Raised Below)</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b71-10\">POINT IV THE DEFENDANT\u2019S RIGHT TO DUE PROCESS OF LAW AS GUARANTEED BY THE FOURTEENTH AMENDMENT TO THE <em>UNITED STATES CONSTITUTION </em>AND ART. 1 PAR. 1 OF THE <em>NEW JERSEY CONSTITUTION </em>WAS VIOLATED BY PROSECUTORIAL MISCONDUCT ON SUMMATION (Not Raised Below)</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b71-11\">POINT V THE TRIAL COURT DEPRIVED THE DEFENDANT OF DUE PROCESS OF LAW AS GUARANTEED BY THE FOURTEENTH AMENDMENT TO THE <em>UNITED STATES CONSTITUTION </em>AND ART. 1 PAR. 1 OF THE <em>NEW JERSEY CONSTITUTION </em>BY FAILING TO INSTRUCT THE JURY ON THE LESSER OFFENSE OF AGGRAVATED ASSAULT THAT WAS RATIONALLY SUPPORTED BY THE RECORD</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b71-12\">POINT VI THE STATE FAILED TO PROVE BEYOND A REASONABLE DOUBT THAT THE DEFENDANT HAD KNOWINGLY AND VOLUNTARILY WAIVED HIS MIRANDA RIGHTS</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b72-4\"><page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"38\">*38</page-number>POINT VII THE DEFENDANT\u2019S SENTENCE IS EXCESSIVE:</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b72-5\">A.

At the request of the Appellate Division, this portion of the opinion is omitted from publication.]</p>\n<p id=\"b72-11\">V.</p>\n<p id=\"b72-12\">Defendant was given a NERA parole ineligibility term on his thirty-five year extended sentence. As defendant was found guilty of first degree robbery based on the proofs at trial including the actual use of a knife, a NERA sentence was appropriate. <em>State v. Johnson, </em>166 <em>N.J. </em>523, 545-46, 766 A.2d 1126 (2001). However, the particular NERA sentence was not appropriate because it was based on the specific extended term.</p>\n<p id=\"b72-13\">In <em>State v. Allen, </em>337 <em>N.J.Super. </em>259, 766 A.2d 1168 (App.Div. 2001), we held, in light of <em>State v. Manzie, </em>335 <em>N.J.Super. </em>267, 762 A.2d 276 (App.Div.2000), that a NERA ineligibility term may not be imposed upon an extended term sentence, but \u201cthat the imposition of an extended term for a first or second degree \u2018violent crime\u2019 (as defined in <em>N.J.S.A. </em>2C:43-7.2d) must embody a parole ineligibility term at least equal to the NERA sentence applicable to the maximum ordinary term for the degree of crime involved.\u201d <em>State v. Allen, </em>337 <em>N.J.Super. </em>at 273-74, 766 A.2d 1168. <em>Manzie </em>was subsequently affirmed by an equally divided Supreme Court. <em>State v. Manzie, </em>168 <em>N.J. </em>113, 773 A.2d 659 (2001). In the view of <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"39\">*39</page-number>the concurring justices who voted to affirm the Appellate Division judgment in <em>Manzie, </em>NERA did not apply to a murder conviction because of the ambiguity and vagueness of the statutory complex requiring an ineligibility term on an unquantifiable sentence of life imprisonment. <em>State v. Manzie, </em>168 <em>N.J. </em>at 116-120, 773 A.2d 659.</p>\n<p id=\"b73-5\">In <em>Allen, </em>we said:</p>\n<blockquote id=\"b73-6\">Of course, [defendant] could receive a sentence of a specific number of years between thirty years and life imprisonment [for the murder conviction], <em>N.J.S.A. </em>2C:ll-3b(l), and if applicable, the length of the NERA ineligibility term would depend on the sentence imposed. On the other hand, if our interpretation of the Parole Act is incorrect and a life sentence cannot be quantified for purposes of NERA, the result in <em>Manzie </em>would be correct because there would be no basis on which to fix an 85% parole ineligibility term on a life sentence for murder or <em>an extended sentence for a first degree crime, </em>and it would be illogical to believe that the Legislature would have envisioned a thirty (or thirty-five) year parole ineligibility term for a life sentence for a person convicted of murder and a twenty-five year parole ineligibility term for other persons sentenced to life imprisonment, <em>see N.J.S.A. </em>2C:43-7, but greater ineligibility terms for those sentenced to a lesser number of years for murder <em>or an extended term for a, first degree crime.</em></blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b73-7\">[337 <em>N.J.Super. </em>at 274 n. 12, 766 A.2d 1168 (emphasis added).]</blockquote>\n<p id=\"b73-8\">Thus, in <em>Allen </em>we concluded that a NERA sentence on an extended term had to be the NERA sentence that would be imposed had defendant been sentenced to the maximum ordinary term for the crime of which he is convicted. We added, however, that \u201cimposition of a mandatory or discretionary ineligibility term on an extended term sentence could be longer if required or authorized by [a non-NERA] statute.\u201d 337 <em>N.J.Super. </em>at 274, 766 A.2d 1168.</p>\n<p id=\"b73-9\">The affirmance of <em>Manzie </em>and rationale of the concurring justices require us to adhere to our opinion in <em>Allen </em>as controlling the sentence governing the date of this offense. We recognize that subsequent to the Supreme Court\u2019s opinion in <em>Manzie, </em>on June 29, 2001, the Acting Governor signed <em>L. </em>2001, c. 129 revising NERA, and that legislation both quantified a life sentence for purposes of NERA and made clear its application to extended terms, as well to murder convictions. However, following the enactment of the new statute, the Supreme Court denied reconsideration of <em>Manzie </em>on July 18, 2001. Under the totality of circum<page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"40\">*40</page-number>stances, including the need to interpret the statutory complex as a logical and consistent whole for a crime occurring before June 29, 2001, we adhere to <em>Allen </em>by virtue of the Supreme Court\u2019s affirmance of <em>Manzie, </em>denial of reconsideration after the enactment of the new statute, and the general prospectivity of a criminal statute. <em>See generally Kendall v. Snedeker, </em>219 <em>N.J.Super. </em>283, 286-88, 530 A.2d 334 (App.Div.1987) (discussing the concepts of \u201cameliorative,\u201d \u201ccurative\u201d and <em>ex post facto </em>legislation).</p>\n<p id=\"b74-6\">Accordingly, the NERA ineligibility term must be 85% of the maximum ordinary term sentence for the first degree robbery, that is 85% of twenty years. <em>See N.J.S.A. </em>2C:43-6a(l). We remand for the imposition of a parole ineligibility term consistent with <em>State v. Allen, supra, </em>337 <em>N.J.Super. </em>at 273-74, 766 A.2d 1168.<footnotemark>2</footnotemark></p>\n<p id=\"b74-7\">VI.</p>\n<p id=\"AGO\">The judgment of conviction is affirmed, and the matter is remanded to the Law Division for further proceedings consistent with this opinion.</p>\n<footnote label=\"1\">\n<p id=\"b71-13\"> On March 3, 2000, we remanded the matter for reconstruction of the sentencing record because the verbatim record of the July 30, 1999 sentencing proceedings was lost. The reconstruction hearing was held on May 5, 2000.</p>\n</footnote>\n<footnote label=\"2\">\n<p id=\"b74-9\"> It is not suggested that in light of the need to vacate the NERA ineligibility term originally imposed, defendant's thirty-five year specific term sentence could otherwise be adjusted. While we are concerned with the \"real time\" consequences of defendant's sentence, double jeopardy and due process problems could flow from any upward adjustment of defendant's specific term sentence even under these circumstances in which the judge considered the impact of NERA in imposing defendant's original sentence.</p>\n</footnote>\n</opinion>\n</casebody>\n",
