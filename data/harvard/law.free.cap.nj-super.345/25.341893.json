We hold that the penalties set forth in <em>N.J.S.A. </em>2C:33-3.1 are not mandated when the Family Part elects to enter an adjourned disposition pursuant to <em>N.J.S.A. </em>2A:4A-43b(l).<footnotemark>1</footnotemark></p>\n<p id=\"b62-5\"><page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"28\">*28</page-number>This issue arises in the context of the following factual and procedural history. N.L. was born on August 20, 1989. On March 7, 2000, when N.L. was age 10, he was charged with an act of juvenile delinquency which, if committed by an adult, would constitute fourth-degree making a false public alarm, contrary to <em>N.J.S.A. </em>2C:33-3(a).<footnotemark>2</footnotemark> Specifically, N.L. was charged with pulling a fire alarm in the hallway of Copper Hill School in Flemington on March 6, 2000, without any fire or smoke being present, causing the fire alarm to go off and the school to be evacuated.</p>\n<p id=\"b62-6\"><em>N.J.S.A. </em>2C:33-3.1, entitled \u201cPenalties for Juvenile Violating N.J.S. 2C:33-3,\u201d was enacted by <em>L. </em>1999, c. 195, \u00a7 2, effective August 31, 1999. <em>N.J.S.A. </em>2C:33-3.1a provides that where a juvenile is \u201cadjudicated delinquent for a violation of <em>N.J.S. </em>2C:33-3 the court shall suspend or postpone the juvenile\u2019s right to operate a motor vehicle including a motorized bicycle for a period of six months, in addition to any other disposition ordered by the court under <em>[N.J.S.A </em>2A:4A-43].\u201d</p>\n<p id=\"b62-7\">Counsel for N.L. filed a motion <em>in limine </em>seeking a determination that the provisions of <em>N.J.S.A. </em>2C:33-3.1 would not be applicable to N.L. if he were to receive a deferred disposition pursuant to <em>N.J.S.A. </em>2A:4A-43b(l) \u201csince such does not constitute an adjudication of juvenile delinquency which would require the imposition of a mandatory period of suspension or postponement of the juvenile\u2019s right to operate or receive a driver\u2019s license.\u201d Specifically, counsel for N.L. argued that when a court orders a deferred disposition pursuant to <em>N.J.S.A. </em>2A:4A-43b(l), it cannot be said that the juvenile was \u201cadjudicated delinquent;\u201d hence, <em>N.J.S.A. </em>2C:33-3.1 is inapplicable.</p>\n<p id=\"b62-8\">A hearing was conducted on N.L.\u2019s motion in the Family Part on May 1, 2000. The judge entered an order on that date, ruling <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"29\">*29</page-number>that the driver\u2019s license postponement provisions contained in <em>N.J.S.A. </em>2C:33-3.1 would be applicable to N.L. if he received a deferred disposition pursuant to <em>N.J.S.A. </em>2A:4A-43b(l). In a written statement of reasons, the judge stated, in pertinent part:</p>\n<blockquote id=\"b63-6\">[T]he juvenile defendant argues that a deferred disposition is not really an adjudication because it results in a dismissal of the complaint if successfully completed. However, the juvenile fails to read <em>N.J.S.A. </em>2A:4A-43b accurately because that statute permits the court to impose a disposition on a juvenile only if he is adjudged delinquent. Without a finding of delinquency, the court is without power to act. Nowhere does <em>[State in the Interest of V.M., </em>279 <em>N.J.Super. </em>535, 653 A.2d 612 (App.Div.1995)], cited by the juvenile, conclude that a deferred disposition does not result in a finding of delinquency. Instead, <em>V.M. </em>addresses whether a deferred disposition is a disposition as contemplated in <em>N.J.S.A. </em>2C:20-2.1. As to that subject, <em>V.M. </em>states: \u201cEven though subsection b(l) characterizes the review period as one which would \u2018[a]djourn formal entry of disposition,\u2019 it is nonetheless listed as a formal disposition---- Accordingly, we are satisfied that <em>N.J.S.A. </em>2A:4A-43 is clear that the placement of a juvenile under a twelve-month adjustment is a disposition. The more difficult question is what consequences flow from this form of disposition.\u201d <em>[V.M., supra, </em>279 <em>N.J.Super. </em>at 537, 653 A.2d 612.]</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"Ac\">In <em>V.M., </em>the court assessed whether a deferred disposition required the suspension or postponement of a juvenile\u2019s driving privileges for theft of a motor vehicle under <em>N.J.SA </em>2C:20-2.1. <em>N.J.SA </em>2A:4A-43(b) provides in pertinent part: \u201cif a juvenile is adjudged delinquent ... the court may order ... one or more of the following dispositions: (1) Ac[journ formal entry of disposition of the case for a period not to exceed 12 months ... and if ... the juvenile makes [a satisfactory] ... adjustment, dismiss the complaint;\u201d however, the court shall assess mandatory drug enforcement and demand reduction penalties of <em>N.J.S. </em>2C:35-15, but may waive imposition of the penalty under <em>N.J.S.A. </em>2C:35-16, which is the loss of driving privileges required for drug offenders. In the case of <em>V.M., </em>the juveniles plead guilty to receiving stolen property in violation of <em>N.J.S.A. </em>2C:20-7 and received a deferred disposition for twelve months. The \u201csentencing\u201d court refused to impose the mandatory fines and penalties required by <em>N.J.S.A. </em>2C:20-2.1. This statute reads in pertinent part: \u201cIn addition to any other disposition authorized by law, a person eonvicted under the provisions of this chapter of theft or unlawful taking of a motor vehicle shall be subject ... to suspension or postponement of the person\u2019s license to operate a motor vehicle____\u201d The <em>V.M. </em>court noted a serious question as to whether the term \u201csubject to\u201d was a mandatory penalty but found no need to resolve whether that phrase was an authorization or a mandate. Instead, the <em>V.M. </em>court said: \u201cIn our view it is incompatible with dismissal of the complaint to require imposition of mandatory penalties unless specifically required by <em>N.J.S.A. </em>2A:4A-43\u201d and concluded that if the penalties of <em>N.J.S.A. </em>2C:20-22.1 were to be mandatory, the Legislature could have included those in <em>N.J.S.A. </em>2A:4A-43 as mandatory along with <em>N.J.S.A. </em>2C:35-15. [279 <em>N.J.Super. </em>at 539, 653 A.2d 612.] Since the Legislature did not, [the court] concluded <em>N.J.S.A. </em>20:20-2.1 was not mandatory for a deferred disposition. <em>[Ibid.]</em></blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b64-5\"><page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"30\">*30</page-number>The <em>V.M. </em>court did not rule on whether <em>N.J.S.A. </em>2C:20-2.1 would be mandatory for other juvenile dispositions. I note that <em>N.J.S.A. </em>2C:20-2.1 was enacted in 1993 to increase penalties for theft or unlawful taking of motor vehiclefe] was however to be mandatory in adult sentencing. <em>State v. Roma [Rama], </em>298 <em>N.J.Super. </em>339[, 689 A.2d 776] (App.Div.1997)[, <em>aff'd, </em>153 <em>N.J. </em>162, 707 A.2d 999 (1998).]</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b64-6\">Unlike <em>N.J.S.A </em>20:20-2.1, <em>N.J.S.A. </em>20:33-3.1, which was enacted to be effective August 31, 1999, does not suggest mere authorization to require the penalty. The language is directed specifically to juveniles and the terms are unequivocal. When a juvenile is adjudicated delinquent for making a false public alarm, \u201cthe court shall suspend or postpone the juvenile\u2019s right to operate a motor vehicle____\u201d As already noted, <em>N.J.S.A. </em>2A:4A-43 requires an adjudication of delinquency before any disposition including a deferred disposition may be imposed by the court. Therefore, any juvenile who pleads or is found guilty of violating <em>N.J.S.A. </em>20:33-3, even though a deferred disposition is imposed, must have'his or her license suspended or postponed for six months as part of that or \u201cany other disposition.\u201d</blockquote>\n<p id=\"b64-9\">[Footnote omitted.]</p>\n<p id=\"b64-10\">On May 18, 2000, N.L. pled guilty to the charged act of delinquency and the Family Part adjourned formal entry of disposition of the case for a period of one year, pursuant to the provisions of <em>N.J.S.A. </em>2A:4A-43b(l). If N.L. made a satisfactory adjustment during the period of continuance, the complaint was to be dismissed.<footnotemark>3</footnotemark> However, in accordance with its decision on N.L.\u2019s motion <em>in limine, </em>the court required that N.L.\u2019s privilege to apply for a motor vehicle driver\u2019s license be postponed for a period of six months, pursuant to <em>N.J.S.A. </em>2C:33-3.1a.</p>\n<p id=\"b64-11\">On appeal, N.L. contends that since the complaint was to be dismissed when he successfully completes the continuance period established in the deferred disposition imposed, the driver\u2019s license suspension provisions of <em>N.J.S.A. </em>2C:33-3.1a are inapplicable.</p>\n<p id=\"b64-12\">Upon the filing of a complaint charging a minor with acts of delinquency, unless the complaint is diverted pursuant to <em>N.J.S.A. </em>2A:4A-71 to-75, the New Jersey Code of Juvenile Justice, <em>N.J.S.A. </em>2A:4A-20 to-90, contemplates two basic procedural phas<page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"31\">*31</page-number>es to the processing and resolution of the matter. <em>See N.J.S.A. </em>2A:4A-41.</p>\n<p id=\"b65-5\">Absent a guilty plea to the charged delinquent behavior, the first phase is a hearing, or trial, to determine whether the State can meet its burden to prove, beyond a reasonable doubt, that the juvenile committed the charged act of delinquency. <em>See State v. Torres, </em>313 <em>N.J.Super. </em>129, 145, 713 A.2d 1 (App.Div.), <em>certif. denied, </em>156 <em>N.J. </em>425, 719 A.2d 1023 (1998) (juveniles charged with acts of delinquency are accorded all rights given to adults charged with a crime). If, after a trial, the court is satisfied that the State has proven each and every element of the offense beyond a reasonable doubt, then the court \u201cadjudicates\u201d the juvenile guilty of the act of delinquency.</p>\n<p id=\"b65-6\">Similarly, if the juvenile enters a plea of guilty to the act of delinquency, and offers or acknowledges a factual basis to support the plea, the court \u201cadjudicates\u201d the juvenile guilty of the act of delinquency. <em>See State in Interest of J.R., </em>244 <em>N.J.Super. </em>630, 638, 583 A.2d 376 (App.Div.1990).</p>\n<p id=\"b65-7\">The second procedural phase is the \u201cdispositional hearing,\u201d which occurs after \u201ca juvenile is adjudicated delinquent!.]\u201d <em>N.J.S.A. </em>2A:4A-41. At the dispositional hearing of a juvenile \u201cadjudged delinquent,\u201d the court may order one or more of the twenty dispositions currently enumerated in <em>N.J.S.A. </em>2A:4A-43(b), including:</p>\n<blockquote id=\"b65-8\">(1) Adjourn formal entry of disposition of the case for a period not to exceed 12 months for the purpose of determining whether the juvenile makes a satisfactory adjustment, and if during the period of continuance the juvenile makes such an adjustment, dismiss the complaint; provided that <em>if the court adjourns formal entry of disposition of delinquency for a violation of an offense defined in chapter 35 or 36 of Title 2C of the New Jersey Statutes the court shall assess the mandatory penalty set forth in N.J.S. 2C:S5-15 but may waive imposition of the penalty set forth in N.J.S. 2C:S5-16 for juveniles adjudicated delinquent </em>[.] <em>[N.J.S.A. </em>2A:4A-43(b)(l) (emphasis added).]</blockquote>\n<p id=\"b65-9\">In <em>State in Interest of V.M., </em>279 <em>N.J.Super. </em>535, 537, 653 A.2d 612 (App.Div.1995), speaking through Judge Wallace, we concluded that adjourning formal entry of disposition pursuant to <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"32\">*32</page-number><em>N.J.S.A. </em>2A:4A-43b(l) by \u201cplacement of a juvenile under a twelvemonth adjustment is a disposition.\u201d As we noted, however, \u201c[t]he more difficult question is what consequences flow from this form of disposition.\u201d <em>Ibid. </em>This is so because when \u201cthe juvenile makes a satisfactory adjustment\u201d during the period of the adjourned disposition, the delinquency complaint is dismissed. <em>N.J.S.A </em>2A:4A-43b(l).</p>\n<p id=\"b66-7\">In <em>V.M., </em>we analyzed whether the driver\u2019s license suspension penalty provision contained in <em>N.J.S.A. </em>2C:20-2.1(a)(l) was applicable when a juvenile pleads guilty to an act of delinquency constituting the theft or unlawful taking of a motor vehicle, contrary to <em>N.J.S.A. </em>2C:20-3(b), and receives an adjourned disposition pursuant to <em>N.J.S.A. </em>2A:4A-43b(l). <em>Id. </em>at 536, 653 A.2d 612. In rejecting the State\u2019s contention that, since an adjourned disposition is a \u201cdisposition\u201d under the New Jersey Code of Juvenile Justice, the driver\u2019s license suspension was required, Judge Wallace stated, in pertinent part:</p>\n<blockquote id=\"b66-8\">\u201cStatutes <em>in pari materia </em>are to be construed together when helpful in resolving doubts or uncertainties and the ascertainment of legislative intent.\u201d <em>State v. Green, </em>62 <em>N.J. </em>547, 554-55, 303 A.2d 312 (1973). In reading the statutes together (N.J.S.A 2A:4A-43b(l) and N.J.S.A. 20:20-2.1), we are satisfied that the Legislature -did not intend the theft penalties in <em>N.J.S.A. </em>20:20-2.1 to apply to a disposition in the form of a review period under <em>N.J.S.A. </em>2A:4A-43b(l). This latter section provides for adjournment of \u201cformal entry of disposition[s]\u201d and further provides that \u201cif during the period of continuance the juvenile makes such an adjustment, [the court shall] dismiss the complaint.\u201d In our view it is incompatible with dismissal of the complaint to require imposition of mandatory penalties, unless specifically required by <em>N.J.S.A. </em>2A:4A-43. Further, our interpretation is supported by the express wording of <em>N.J.S.A </em>2A:4A-43b(l), which provides that upon adjournment of \u201cformal entry of disposition of delinquency ... the court shall assess the mandatory penalties set forth in N.J.S. 2C:35-15 but may waive imposition of the penalty set forth in N.J.S. 20:35-16 for juveniles adjudicated delinquent.\u201d Surely, if the Legislature intended the penalties of <em>N.J.S.A </em>20:20-2.1 to apply to a disposition under N.J.S.A. 2A:4A-43b(l), it would have expressly included <em>N.J.S.A. </em>20:20-2.1 in this section of the statute.</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b66-9\"><em>[V.M., supra, </em>2Y9 <em>N.J.Super. </em>at 539, 653 A.2d 612.]</blockquote>\n<p id=\"b66-10\">When the Legislature enacted <em>N.J.S.A. </em>2C:33-3.1, effective August 31, 1999, it may be presumed it was familiar with our construction in <em>V.M. </em>of <em>N.J.S.A. </em>2A:4A-43b(l). <em>Chase Manhattan Bank v. Josephson, </em>135 <em>N.J. </em>209, 227, 638 A.2d 1301 (1994); <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"33\">*33</page-number><em>Brewer v.

However, when adopting <em>N.J.S.A. </em>2C:33-3.1, the Legislature did not amend <em>N.J.S.A. </em>2A:4A-43b(l) to expressly require the court, in an adjourned disposition where the complaint is to be dismissed upon a satisfactory adjustment during the period of continuance, to impose the driver\u2019s license suspension or postponement penalty provided in <em>N.J.S.A. </em>2C:33-3.1a.</p>\n<p id=\"b67-6\">Reading the provisions contained in <em>N.J.S.A. </em>2C:33-3.1a and <em>N.J.S.A. </em>2A:4A-43b(l) <em>in pari materia, </em>we conclude it is incompatible with dismissal of the complaint to require imposition of the mandatory driver\u2019s license privileges\u2019 suspension or postponement in the absence of a specific requirement to do so in <em>N.J.S.A </em>2C:2A:4A-43b(l).</p>\n<p id=\"b67-7\">We must recognize that \u201c[t]he juvenile justice system places much greater emphasis [than the adult system] upon rehabilitation[,]\u201d <em>State in the Interest of S.T., </em>273 <em>N.J.Super. </em>436, 444, 642 A.2d 422 (App.Div.1994) (citing <em>State in the Interest of CA.H. and B.A.R., </em>89 <em>N.J. </em>326, 336, 446 A.2d 93 (1982)), and that \u201c[t]he basic philosophy in the treatment of juvenile offenders has always been to reform and educate juveniles, not to punish them.\u201d <em>Ibid. </em>(citing <em>State v. Smith, </em>32 <em>N.J. </em>501, 536, 161 A.2d 520 (1960), <em>cert. denied, </em>364 <em>U.S. </em>936, 81 <em>S.Ct. </em>383, 5 L.Ed.2d 367 (1961)). <em>See also N.J.S.A. </em>2A:4A-21 (outlining the purposes of the Code of Juvenile Justice).</p>\n<p id=\"b67-8\">Here, N.L. was age ten when the act of delinquency was committed and had no prior record of delinquency. Clearly, N.L. was an appropriate candidate for an adjourned disposition pursuant to <em>N.J.S.A. </em>2A:4A-43b(l), if not for diversion of the complaint pursuant to <em>N.J.S.A. </em>2A:4A-71(b) or <em>N.J.S.A. </em>2A:4A-73.<footnotemark>4</footnotemark></p>\n<p id=\"b68-5\"><page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"34\">*34</page-number>In our view, if the Legislature intended that juveniles who are adjudged delinquent for violating <em>N.J.S.A. </em>2C:33-3 be subject to the mandatory penalties provided in <em>N.J.S.A. </em>2C:33-3.1a, even when given an adjourned disposition pursuant to <em>N.J.S.A. </em>2A:4A-72b(l) that results in dismissal of the complaint, then the expression of such intent had to be contained in the adjourned disposition section, <em>N.J.S.A. </em>2A:4A-43b(l). We reach this conclusion because the disposition imposed resulted in a satisfactory adjustment and dismissal of the complaint.</p>\n<p id=\"b68-6\">Additionally, when considering application of mandatory penalties to juvenile dispositions, the Legislature has historically differentiated between adjourned dispositions imposed pursuant to <em>N.J.S.A </em>2A:4A-43b(l) and the other nineteen dispositions authorized by <em>N.J.S.A. </em>2A:4A \u2014 43b.</p>\n<p id=\"b68-7\">When the Legislature enacted <em>N.J.S.A. </em>2C:35-15 and-16 by adoption of <em>L. </em>1987, c. 106, \u00a7 1, both sections mandated that the DEDR and driver license suspension or postponement penalties be applied to juveniles \u201cadjudicated delinquent\u201d of any offense contained in chapters 35 or 36 of Title 2C. However, at the time <em>N.J.S.A. </em>2C:35-15 and-16 were enacted, <em>N.J.S.A. </em>2A:4A-43b(l) was silent on the applicability of the DEDR and driver\u2019s license suspension penalties to juveniles adjudicated delinquent who were given an adjourned disposition.</p>\n<p id=\"b68-8\">Thereafter, the Legislature engrafted a provision onto <em>N.J.S.A. </em>2A:4A-43b(l) providing that, when imposing an adjourned disposition for an act of delinquency that constitutes a violation of chapters 35 or 36 in Title 2C, \u201cthe court shall assess the mandatory penalty set forth in N.J.S. 20:35-15 but may waive imposition <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"35\">*35</page-number>of the penalty set forth in N.J.S. 2C:35-16 for juveniles adjudicated delinquent.\u201d <em>L. </em>1988, c. 44, \u00a7 16, <em>eff. </em>June 28,1988.</p>\n<p id=\"b69-5\">We therefore conclude that the mandatory penalties set forth in <em>N.J.S.A. </em>20:33-3.1 do not apply to a juvenile who is adjudicated delinquent where an adjourned disposition is ordered by the court pursuant to <em>N.J.S.A. </em>2A:4A-43b(l).</p>\n<p id=\"b69-6\">Reversed and remanded for entry of an amended disposition consistent with this opinion.</p>\n<footnote label=\"1\">\n<p id=\"b61-13\"> However, if the juvenile fails to make a satisfactory adjustment during the period of continuance, resulting in the adjourned disposition being vacated, and one or more of the other dispositional alternatives enumerated in <em>N.J.SA. </em>2A:4A-43b is entered, imposition of the penalties contained in <em>NJ.SA. </em>2C:33-3.1 is mandatory.</p>\n</footnote>\n<footnote label=\"2\">\n<p id=\"b62-9\"> We note that a violation of <em>N.J.S.A. </em>2C:33-3(a) was upgraded to a crime of the third degree by <em>L. </em>1999, <em>c. </em>195, \u00a7 1, effective August 31, 1999.
