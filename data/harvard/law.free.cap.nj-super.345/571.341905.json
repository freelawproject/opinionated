He was sentenced on the robbery charge to an extended term of twenty years subject to an eight-year term of parole ineligibility, and, on the burglary charge, to a concurrent five-year term. Required statutory penalties were also imposed. Defendant appeals, and we reverse on the ground of prosecutorial misconduct.</p>\n<p id=\"b607-10\">The gravamen of the crimes charged against defendant arose out of the robbery, in her home, of the seventy-four year old victim during the late evening of December 14, 1998. She had arrived home at about 10 p.m., parked her car in her driveway, and was accosted by her assailant as she was entering the house. Her assailant pushed her into the house, stole her purse and fled when he heard the alarm of her car, which she was able to activate as she was still holding her car key. . The victim summoned the police and gave them a description of the assailant. Believing that defendant, who was known to the police, fit that description, the officer included his picture in a photographic array. The victim identified defendant, who was arrested four days later. The sole witnesses for the State at trial were the victim and the officer. Defendant produced no evidence, his defense resting on the assertion of mistaken identification by the victim. The jury, however, evidently accepted the victim\u2019s testimony.</p>\n<p id=\"b608-4\"><page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"574\">*574</page-number>In challenging the judgment of conviction, defendant raises the following issues:</p>\n<blockquote id=\"b608-5\">I. VICTIM IMPACT APPEALS CONCERNING SENIOR CITIZENS AS VICTIMS OF CRIME MADE BY THE PROSECUTOR IN HER OPENING STATEMENT WERE IMPROPER AND DEPRIVED THE DEFENDANT OF A FAIR TRIAL. (NOT RAISED BELOW)</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b608-6\">II. TESTIMONY THAT DETECTIVE COLANDUONI HAD \u201cPERSONAL KNOWLEDGE\u201d OF DEFENDANT SUBSTANTIALLY PREJUDICED DEFENDANT\u2019S RIGHT TO A FAIR TRIAL BECAUSE IT WAS NOT RELEVANT TO ANY MATERIAL ISSUE AND BECAUSE IT CLEARLY SUGGESTED THAT DEFENDANT HAD A PRIOR CRIMINAL RECORD. (NOT RAISED BELOW)</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b608-7\">III. THE PROSECUTOR\u2019S COMMENTS IN SUMMATION DEPRIVED THE DEFENDANT OF HIS RIGHT TO A FAIR TRIAL. (NOT RAISED BELOW)</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b608-8\">IV. IMPOSITION OF AN EXTENDED TERM SENTENCE OF TWENTY (20) YEARS WITH EIGHT (8) YEARS OF PAROLE INELIGIBILITY ON DEFENDANT\u2019S CONVICTION FOR ROBBERY (COUNT TWO) WAS MANIFESTLY EXCESSIVE AND AN ABUSE OF THE SENTENCING COURT\u2019S DISCRETION.</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b608-9\">A. THE COURT ABUSED ITS DISCRETION IN SENTENCING THE DEFENDANT TO AN EXTENDED TERM.</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b608-11\">B. IMPOSING A BASE SENTENCE OF TWENTY (20) YEARS WITH EIGHT (8) YEARS OF PAROLE INELIGIBILITY WAS MANIFESTLY EXCESSIVE AND AN ABUSE OF THE COURT\u2019S DISCRETION.</blockquote>\n<p id=\"b608-14\">We address first the claim of prosecutorial misconduct in the summation. After discussing the identification evidence, the prosecutor had this to say:</p>\n<blockquote id=\"b608-15\">But if that was not enough, let\u2019s look at the conduct briefly of George Tilghman. He is arrested in his home. Very calmly asks, what is this all about? He is in front of his brother and sister. The detective looks at George Tilghman, and I guess out of some respect for privacy says, it is up to you, do you want them to know? Well, yeah, I\u2019d like to know, too. The officer tells him that he has an arrest warrant charging robbery, for the robbery of an elderly woman, four nights ago, December 14th, on Monday.</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b608-16\">What is the reaction? One of shock? One of horror? One that you would expect of someone had not committed such an awful crime and knew exactly where they were? No, none of that. But what did you get? That is a heck of a way to spend the holidays. That was his reaction. I submit to you, that was his way of saying, his way of realizing, and saying without thinking, I just got busted.</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b609-5\"><page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"575\">*575</page-number>If that is not enough, the positive identification, the same garment being worn, then we have what happens at police headquarters. Sitting, again, calmly in an interview room, going over the <em>Miranda </em>form, I\u2019ll leave that again to your common sense, someone was just told that they were arrested for a crime that they absolutely didn\u2019t commit, would they calmly be sitting in an interview room at a chair and table or would they literally and figuratively be climbing the walls because in this case he was not?</blockquote>\n<p id=\"b609-6\">These remarks were followed by the prosecutor\u2019s statement to the jury regarding the interrogation of defendant that did ensue. According to the prosecutor, when defendant perceived that his \u201calibi didn\u2019t work,\u201d he told the interrogating officer \u201cI don\u2019t want to talk anymore, give me a lawyer____\u201d</p>\n<p id=\"b609-7\">We recognize that there was no objection to these remarks at trial and hence that the asserted error must be evaluated by the plain-error standard, namely whether the misconduct was so egregious in the context of the summation as a whole as to deprive defendant of a fair trial. <em>See, e.g., State v. Smith, </em>167 <em>N.J. </em>158, 181-182, 770 A.2d 255 (2001); <em>State v. Frost, </em>158 <em>N.J. </em>76, 83, 87-89, 727 A.2d 1 (1999). We are constrained to conclude that the prosecutor\u2019s remarks met that standard.</p>\n<p id=\"b609-8\">The prosecutor is accorded considerable latitude in summing up the State\u2019s case forcefully and graphically and to pursue the prosecutorial duty with earnestness and vigor. <em>See, e.g., State v. Smith, supra, </em>167 <em>N.J. </em>at 177, 770 A.2d 255 (2001); <em>State v. Frost, supra, </em>158 <em>N.J. </em>at 82, 727 A.2d 1; <em>State v. Harvey, </em>151 <em>N.J. </em>117, 216, 699 A.2d 596 (1997). Nevertheless, prosecutors also have the overriding obligation to see that justice is fairly done. The classic statement of that obligation by the United States Supreme Court in <em>Berger v. United States, </em>295 <em>U.S. </em>78, 88, 55 <em>S.Ct. </em>629, 633, 79 <em>L.Ed. 1314, </em>1321 (1935), explains that:</p>\n<blockquote id=\"b609-9\">The * * [prosecuting] Attorney is the representative not of an ordinary party to a controversy, but of a sovereignty whose obligation to govern impartially is as compelling as its obligation to govern at all; and whose interest, therefore, in a criminal prosecution is not that it shall win a case, but that justice shall be done. As such, he is in a peculiar and very definite sense the servant of the law, the twofold aim of which is that guilt shall not escape or innocence suffer. He may prosecute with earnestness and vigor-indeed, he should do so. But, while he may strike hard blows, he is not at liberty to strike foul ones. It is as much his duty to <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"576\">*576</page-number>refrain from improper methods calculated to produce a wrongful conviction as it is to use every legitimate means to bring about a just one.</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b610-5\">It is fair to say that the average jury, in a greater or less degree, has confidence that these obligations, which so plainly rest upon the prosecuting attorney, will be faithfully observed. Consequently, improper suggestions, insinuations, and, especially, assertions of personal knowledge are apt to carry much weight against the accused when they should properly carry none.</blockquote>\n<p id=\"b610-6\"><em>See also State v. Rose, </em>112 <em>N.J. </em>454, 509, 548 A.2d 1058 (1988); <em>State v. Gregg, </em>278 <em>N.J.Super. </em>182, 190, 650 A.2d 835 (App.Div. 1994), <em>certif. denied, </em>140 <em>N.J. </em>277, 658 A.2d 300 (1995); <em>State v. Acker, </em>265 <em>N.J.Super. </em>351, 355-356, 627 A.2d 170 (App.Div.), <em>certif. denied, </em>134 <em>N.J. </em>485, 634 A.2d 530 (1993).</p>\n<p id=\"b610-7\">We are persuaded that the prosecutor struck foul blows. She offered as proof of defendant\u2019s guilt the victim\u2019s identification, defendant\u2019s post-arrest silence, and his request for a lawyer. Obviously, however, neither post-arrest silence nor a request for a lawyer is even admissible, and, just as obviously, neither is, <em>a fortiori, </em>probative of guilt. With respect to post-arrest silence, we recently reiterated the governing constitutional principle prohibiting a prosecutor from commenting on defendant\u2019s post-arrest silence. Thus, in <em>State v. Pierce, </em>330 <em>N.J.Super. </em>479, 492, 750 A.2d 139 (App.Div.2000), we again emphasized that:</p>\n<blockquote id=\"b610-8\">No inculpatory inference may be permissibly drawn from a defendant\u2019s decision to remain silent following his arrest. <em>Doyle v. Ohio, </em>426 <em>U.S. </em>610, 96 <em>S.Ct </em>2240, 49 <em>L. </em>Ed.2d 91 (1976); <em>State v. Lyle, </em>73 <em>N.J. </em>403, 416, 375 A.2d 629 (1977); <em>State v. Deatore, </em>70 <em>N.J. </em>100, 115, 358 A.2d 163 (1976); <em>State v. Aceta, </em>223 <em>N.J.Super. </em>21, 28, 537 A.2d 1317 (App.Div.1988). We stated in <em>State v. Hyde, </em>292 <em>N.J.Super. </em>159, 160, 678 A.2d 717 (App.Div.1996), that \u201csilence will carry no penalty,\u201d and our Supreme Court held over two decades ago that:</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"AL1\">a defendant is under no obligation to volunteer to the authorities at the first opportunity the exculpatory story he later tells at his trial and cannot be penalized directly or indirectly if he does not.</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b610-9\"><em>[State v. Deatore, supra, </em>70 <em>N.J. </em>at 115, 358 A.2d 163.]</blockquote>\n<p id=\"b610-10\"><em>See also State v. Pepshi, </em>162 <em>N.J. </em>490, 493, 745 A.2d 494 (1999) in which the Court made clear that apparent indifference to arrest or acceptance of police conduct are not indicative of a consciousness of guilt.</p>\n<p id=\"b610-11\">The prosecutor\u2019s protracted remarks here respecting defendant\u2019s post-arrest silence and her invitation to the jury to infer <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"577\">*577</page-number>guilt therefrom were egregious and inexcusable. Not less so was her observation that defendant requested an attorney when, as she suggested, he perceived that his \u201calibi didn\u2019t work.\u201d Again, what she was doing was inviting the jury to infer guilt from the request for an attorney. And that is plainly an infringement of defendant\u2019s constitutional right to counsel. <em>See State v. Feaster, </em>156 <em>N.J. </em>1, 75-76, 716 A.2d 395 (1998), holding that while the trial should be free of any reference to a criminal defendant\u2019s invocation of the right to counsel, such references will not constitute reversible error if their import is other than to suggest to the jury that it draw a negative inference from the invocation. We are, however, satisfied that here the reference had both that purpose and that effect.</p>\n<p id=\"b611-6\">We are, for these reasons, persuaded that the summation itself warrants a reversal here. In <em>State v. Watson, </em>224 <em>N.J.Super. </em>354, 362, 540 A.2d 875 (App.Div.), <em>certif. denied, </em>111 <em>N.J. </em>620, 546 A.2d 537, <em>cert. denied, </em>488 <em>U.S. </em>983, 109 <em>S.Ct. </em>535, 102 L. <em>Ed.2d </em>566 (1988), Judge Baime noted that \u201c[w]e would be remiss, however, were we to fail to note that instances of prosecutorial excesses in the course of summation seem to come to this court with numbing frequency.\u201d We repeated that observation in <em>State v. Acker, supra, </em>265 <em>N.J.Super. </em>at 355, 627 A.2d 170, and the Supreme Court reiterated it in <em>State v. Frost, supra, </em>158 <em>N.J. </em>at 88, 727 A.2d 1. While the Supreme Court in <em>State v. Frost </em>rejected a <em>per se </em>rule of reversible error, we are confident that that rejection was not intended as a license to prosecutors to say anything at all to the jury, no matter how prejudicial, that they think might sway it towards a conviction. Although we reverse the conviction only when, as here, the prosecutorial misconduct is prejudicial and egregious, we again remind the prosecutors that their obligation demands appropriate restraint in every case.</p>\n<p id=\"b611-7\">We need comment only briefly on defendant\u2019s appellate challenge to the prosecutor\u2019s remarks both on the opening statement and in summation in which she discussed the social problem posed by the vulnerability of elderly victims who are preyed upon <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"578\">*578</page-number>by the young and strong, referring to defendant as \u201ca perfect example\u201d of a person who preys upon the elderly. These remarks came perilously close to, if indeed they did not constitute, a plea to the jury to protect the elderly as a group, just the type of comment we strongly criticized in <em>State v. Acker, supra, </em>265 <em>N.J.Super. </em>at 356, 627 A.2d 170, in which we found reversible error in the prosecutorial statement that it was the jury\u2019s function to protect young victims of alleged sexual offenses \u201cas a group.\u201d <em>See also State v. Kenny, </em>128 <em>N.J.Super. </em>94, 110-111, 319 A.2d 232 (App.Div.1974), <em>aff'd, </em>68 <em>N.J. </em>17, 342 A.2d 189 (1975), criticizing the prosecutor\u2019s continual references to the <em>modus operandi </em>of Hudson County corruption in general in the trial of a freeholder on a specific charge. On retrial, the prosecutor must remember that defendant has been charged with a specific crime which the State must prove beyond a reasonable doubt and that he is not on trial as the exemplar of a particular social problem.</p>\n<p id=\"b612-5\">Finally, defendant now objects to the prosecutor\u2019s examination of the police officer eliciting his testimony that when he heard the victim\u2019s description, he suspected that the assailant was defendant because he knew him. Defendant argues that although the testimony appears to be neutral on its face, its implication is that the officer knew defendant because of defendant\u2019s prior criminal conduct. The testimony was given to explain why defendant\u2019s photograph was included in the array. We are of the view that that testimony was not necessary to the proofs respecting the victim\u2019s identification, and, if anything improperly bolstered it by letting the jury know that the victim had chosen the photograph of the person the officer already suspected. We recognize that the officer\u2019s testimony did not involve the hearsay information problem dealt with in <em>State v. Bankston, </em>63 <em>N.J. </em>263, 307 A.2d 65 (1973), or its consequent holding that all that need be said, if anything need be said, is that the officer acted on information obtained. Nevertheless, we are persuaded that since there was no legitimate need for an explanation of why defendant\u2019s picture was included in the array, it was improper to elicit the testimony and <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"579\">*579</page-number>thereby to risk the inference that the jury would assume that defendant had prior criminal contact with the police.</p>\n<p id=\"b613-6\">Since the matter must be retried, we need not address defendant\u2019s claim that the sentence was excessive. He will have to be resentenced if again convicted, and we are confident that the trial court, if it again elects to impose an extended term based on defendant\u2019s status as a persistent offender, will follow the procedure prescribed by <em>State v. Dunbar, </em>108 <em>N.J. </em>80, 527 A.2d 1346 (1987), and make all the required findings.</p>\n<p id=\"b613-7\">The judgment of conviction is reversed, and we remand for a new trial.</p>\n</opinion>\n</casebody>\n",
