State troopers Jay Miller and Brian Mulholland testified that while on routine patrol in Alloway Township, Salem County, they observed a car straddling the center line of the roadway approaching in the opposite direction. After the troopers were forced to pull to the shoulder to avoid a collision, they made a U-turn, activated their overhead lights and siren, and began to follow the Mendez car. The driver, Jose, accelerated and went through several stop signs without stopping, swerved into the opposing lane of traffic, drove in excess of the speed limit, and crossed the lawn of a corner property. While the troopers were chasing the Mendez car, they observed Timothy in the front passenger seat discarding various items out the car window, including a piece of paper, a round object the size of a baseball, a beer bottle and what appeared to be a white powdery substance in a plastic bag. After the pursuit had continued for approximately five miles, defendants drove their ear into the driveway of a private home. The troopers then placed defendants under arrest and searched the car, which resulted in the discovery of a police radio scanner and two glassine bags containing white powder that tested positive for cocaine.</p>\n<p id=\"b537-5\"><page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"503\">*503</page-number>Shortly thereafter, the troopers returned to the route of their pursuit of defendants to search for the items they had seen Timothy throw out the car window. They found a lottery ticket with a glassine bag and small straw inside it, which they deduced had been thrown from the car because it was dry and the ground was wet from rain earlier in the evening. However, the troopers were not able to find any white powder or the other items they had seen Timothy throw from the car.</p>\n<p id=\"b537-6\">Testifying on his own behalf, Jose denied going through stop signs or committing any other motor vehicle infractions during the troopers\u2019 pursuit of the car. However, he admitted recognizing the troopers at the outset of the chase, seeing their overhead lights go on, knowing that they wanted him to stop, and deliberately failing to do so. When asked why he did not stop immediately after the troopers activated their overhead lights, Jose responded:</p>\n<blockquote id=\"b537-7\">Well, all the streets that we were on were all dark roads, and there\u2019s no \u2014 there\u2019s really no room to pull a ear over and you still be off the road, and there\u2019s no lights anywhere on none of those roads, and it was dark. And I don\u2019t have the best \u2014 I don\u2019t \u2014 with the cops, me and the cops, they don\u2019t get along with me, period.</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b537-8\">Timothy did not take the stand.</blockquote>\n<p id=\"b537-9\">Based on this evidence, the jury found Jose guilty of second degree eluding a police officer, in violation of <em>N.J.S.A. </em>2C:29-2b, and possession of a police scanner while in the course of committing or attempting to commit a crime, in violation of <em>N.J.S.A. </em>2C:33-22. The jury found Timothy guilty of tampering with physical evidence, in violation of <em>N.J.S.A. </em>20:28-6(1), possession of a police scanner while in the course of committing or attempting to commit a crime, and the disorderly persons offense of resisting arrest, in violation of <em>N.J.S.A. </em>2C:29-2a. The jury acquitted both defendants of possession of cocaine charges.</p>\n<p id=\"b537-10\">The court sentenced Jose to a seven year term of imprisonment for eluding and a concurrent nine month term for unlawful possession of a police scanner. The court sentenced Timothy to eighteen month terms of imprisonment for tampering with evidence and <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"504\">*504</page-number>unlawful possession of a police scanner and six months for resisting arrest, all to be served concurrently.</p>\n<p id=\"b538-5\">Defendants filed separate appeals from their convictions, which we now consolidate. We reject the arguments raised in both appeals, and affirm defendants\u2019 convictions.</p>\n<p id=\"b538-6\">I</p>\n<p id=\"b538-7\">Jose Mendez\u2019s primary argument is that the- trial court did not properly instruct the jury with respect to the charge of eluding. <em>N.J.S.A. </em>2C:29-2b states in pertinent part:</p>\n<blockquote id=\"b538-8\">Any person, while operating a motor vehicle on any street or highway in this State ..., who knowingly flees or attempts to elude any police or law enforcement officer after having received any signal from such officer to bring the vehicle ... to a full stop commits a crime of the third degree; except that, a person is guilty of a crime of the second degree if the flight or attempt to elude creates a risk of death or injury to any person.<footnotemark>l</footnotemark></blockquote>\n<p id=\"b538-9\">Defendant argues that because eluding may consist of an \u201cattempt[ ] to elude,\u201d the court was required to instruct the jury in accordance with the law of attempt, specifically that the State had to prove that defendant had the purpose to elude the police.</p>\n<p id=\"b538-10\">Defendant did not object to the court\u2019s eluding instruction at trial. Therefore, any error in this instruction would be grounds for reversal only if it were plain error. <em>See State v. Afanador, </em>151 <em>N.J. </em>41, 54, 697 A.2d 529 (1997).</p>\n<p id=\"b538-11\">The offense of eluding a law enforcement officer by motor vehicle was not part of the original Code of Criminal Justice (Code) enacted in 1978, <em>L. </em>1978, c. 95, and, unlike most other offenses proscribed by the Code, it is not derived from the Model Penal Code. Although similar provisions may be found in the laws of a number of other jurisdictions, <em>see, e.g., Colo.Rev.Stat. </em>\u00a7 18-9-116.5 (1999); <em>Or.Rev.Stat. </em>\u00a7 811.540 (1999); <em>Wis. Stat. </em>\u00a7 346.04 (1999), we have not been able to locate any case authority perti<page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"505\">*505</page-number>nent to the issue presented in this appeal. Therefore, we must decide the issue solely on the basis of the language of <em>N.J.S.A. </em>2C:29-2b and the general structure of the Code.</p>\n<p id=\"b539-6\">Mirroring the Model Penal Code, chapter five of the Code recognizes a basic distinction between \u201csubstantive\u201d criminal offenses and \u201cinchoate\u201d offenses such as attempts and conspiracies. See New Jersey Criminal Law Revision Commission, the <em>New Jersey Penal Code, Vol. II: Commentary, </em>(hereinafter <em>New Jersey Penal Code Commentary), </em>Introductory Note to Ch. 5, at 111\u201413 (1971). The defining characteristic of an inchoate offense is \u201cconduct ... designed to culminate in the commission of a substantive offense.\u201d <em>Id. </em>at 111. Thus, \u201cthese offenses always presuppose a purpose to commit another crime.\u201d <em>Ibid. </em>(quoting <em>Model Penal Code </em>(Tentative Draft No. 10, 1960), art. 5 commentary at 24-26).</p>\n<p id=\"b539-7\">Consistent with this view of inchoate offenses, <em>\u201cN.J.S.A. </em>2C:5-1 makes criminal <em>all attempts to commit other crimes </em>defined in the Code, when certain circumstances are present.\u201d <em>State v. Robinson, </em>136 <em>N.J. </em>476, 484, 643 A.2d 591 (1994). Those circumstances are set forth in <em>N.J.S.A. </em>2C:5-la, which provides:</p>\n<blockquote id=\"b539-8\">A person is guilty of an attempt to commit a crime if, acting with the kind of culpability otherwise required for commission of the crime, he:</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b539-9\">(1) Purposely engages in conduct which would constitute the crime if the attendant circumstances were as a reasonable person would believe them to be;</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b539-10\">(2) When causing a particular result is an element of the crime, does or omits to do anything with the purpose of causing such result without further conduct on his part; or</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b539-11\">(3) Purposely does or omits to do anything which, under the circumstances as a reasonable person would believe them to be, is an act or omission constituting a substantial step in a course of conduct planned to culminate in his commission of the crime.</blockquote>\n<p id=\"b539-12\">The common characteristic of the three forms of criminal attempts proscribed by <em>N.J.S.A. </em>2C:5-la is that \u201cthe actor must have for his purpose engaging in the criminal conduct or accomplishing the criminal result which is an element of the substantive crime.\u201d <em>New Jersey Penal Code Commentary, supra, </em>cmt. 3 on 2C:5-1 at 114; <em>see Robinson, supra, </em>136 <em>N.J. </em>at 484-86, 643 A.2d 591.</p>\n<p id=\"b540-4\"><page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"506\">*506</page-number>Viewed in light of these principles, it is evident that the offense of eluding a law enforcement officer by motor vehicle is a substantive criminal offense rather than an inchoate offense involving an attempt to commit another offense. First of all, <em>N.J.S.A. </em>2C:29-2b was enacted as an amendment to the resisting arrest provision in chapter twenty-nine of the Code, <em>L. </em>1981, c. 290, \u00a7 28, which proscribes substantive criminal offenses, rather than chapter five, which proscribes attempts and other inchoate offenses.<footnotemark>2</footnotemark> Moreover, eluding consists simply of fleeing by motor vehicle from a person who the perpetrator knows to be a law enforcement officer. <em>See State v. Seymour, </em>289 <em>N.J.Super. </em>80, 86-87, 672 A.2d 1273 (App.Div.1996). Eluding does not involve an attempt to commit any other substantive offense.</p>\n<p id=\"b540-5\">Most importantly, <em>N.J.S.A. </em>2C:29-2b includes a culpability requirement that is different from the culpability requirement of an attempt. Although a person must act with the <em>\u201cpurpose\u201d </em>to commit a substantive offense to be found guilty of an attempt, Robinson, <em>supra, </em>136 <em>N.J. </em>at 484, 643 A.2d 591, the offense of eluding consists simply of \u201cknowingly\u201d fleeing or attempting to elude a law enforcement officer by motor vehicle after receiving a signal to stop. <em>See State v. Fuqua, </em>303 <em>N.J.Super. </em>40, 44, 696 A.2d 44 (App.Div.1997).</p>\n<p id=\"b540-6\">The Code recognizes four different kinds of culpability, which are separately defined in the subsections of <em>N.J.S.A. </em>2C:2-2(b): (1) \u201cpurposely,\u201d (2) \u201cknowingly,\u201d (3) \u201crecklessly\u201d and (4) \u201cnegligently.\u201d The Code also recognizes that \u201cthe material elements of offenses ... may involve (1) the nature of forbidden conduct, ... (2) the attendant circumstances or (3) the result of conduct.\u201d <em>New Jersey Penal Code Commentary, supra, </em>cmt. 3 on 2C:2-2 at 40 (1971). A culpability requirement applies with respect to each of <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"507\">*507</page-number>these types of material elements. <em>Ibid</em><footnotemark><em>3</em></footnotemark><em> </em>Where the applicable culpability requirement is \u201cknowingly\u201d:</p>\n<blockquote id=\"b541-6\">A person acts knowingly with respect, to the nature of his conduct or the attendant circumstances if he is aware that the conduct is of that nature, or that such circumstances exist, or he is aware of a high probability of their existence. A person acts knowingly with respect to a result of his conduct if he is aware that it is practically certain that his conduct will cause such a result.</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b541-7\"><em>[N.J.S.A. </em>2C:2-2(b)(2).]</blockquote>\n<p id=\"b541-8\">The \u201cattendant circumstances\u201d of eluding under <em>N.J.S.A. </em>2C:29-2b are that the defendant must \u201chav[e] received [a] signal ... to bring the vehicle ... to a full stop\u201d and the person giving the signal must have been a \u201cpolice or law enforcement officer.\u201d The \u201cforbidden conduct\u201d is \u201cflee[ing] or attempt[ing] to elude.\u201d The material elements of eluding do not include any required \u201cresult\u201d of such conduct.</p>\n<p id=\"b541-9\">The only culpability requirement set forth in <em>N.J.S.A. </em>2C:29-2b is \u201cknowingly.\u201d <em>N.J.S.A. </em>2C:2-2(c)(l) provides that \u201c[w]hen the law defining an offense prescribes the kind of culpability that is sufficient for the commission of an offense, without distinguishing among the material elements thereof, such provision shall apply to all the material elements of the offense, unless a contrary purpose plainly appears.\u201d<footnotemark>3</footnotemark>\n<footnotemark>4</footnotemark> Therefore, \u201cunless a contrary purpose plainly appears,\u201d the culpability requirement of both the attendant circumstances of being signaled to stop by a law enforcement officer and the forbidden conduct of fleeing or attempting to elude is \u201cknowingly.\u201d</p>\n<p id=\"b541-10\">Defendant does not dispute that the culpability requirement of the attendant circumstance elements of eluding \u2014 that the <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"508\">*508</page-number>defendant had received a signal to stop and that the person giving the signal was a law enforcement officer \u2014 is \u201cknowingly.\u201d However, defendant contends that because the \u201cforbidden conduct\u201d element of eluding includes not only \u201cfleeting]\u201d but also \u201cattempt[ing] to elude,\u201d the culpability requirement for this element is \u201cpurposely.\u201d</p>\n<p id=\"b542-5\">This argument cannot be reconciled with the legislative determination that the culpability requirement of eluding under <em>N.J.S.A. </em>2C:29-2b is \u201cknowingly\u201d and the constructional rule of <em>N.J.S.A. </em>2C:2-2(c)(l) that a culpability requirement applies to all elements of an offense unless a contrary intent \u201cplainly appears.\u201d Although the phrase \u201cknowingly attempts,\u201d which does not appear anywhere in the Model Penal Code, may initially appear internally inconsistent because the culpability requirement of a criminal attempt is \u201cpurposeful\u201d conduct, <em>N.J.S.A. </em>2C:5-la, the use of the word \u201cattempts\u201d in the definition of a substantive offense does not necessarily reflect a legislative intent to import the law of attempt, including the \u201cpurposeful\u201d culpability requirement, into that offense. Instead, the probable legislative intent in defining the conduct element of eluding as \u201cflees or attempts to elude\u201d rather than \u201cflees or eludes\u201d was to foreclose any argument that success in avoiding police apprehension is an element of the offense, as is the case with certain other offenses proscribed by chapter 29, such as escape <em>(N.J.S.A. </em>2C:29-5).<footnotemark>5</footnotemark> The phrase \u201cattempts to elude\u201d makes it clear that the conduct forbidden by <em>N.J.S.A. </em>2C:29-2b is the act of flight or eluding, and that the elements of the offense do <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"509\">*509</page-number>not include a \u201cresult\u201d element of success in avoiding apprehension by a law enforcement officer.<footnotemark>6</footnotemark></p>\n<p id=\"b543-6\">Because the culpability requirement of the conduct element of eluding is \u201cknowingly\u201d rather than \u201cpurposely,\u201d the State was not required to prove that Jose\u2019s \u201cconscious object,\u201d <em>N.J.S.A. </em>2C:2-2(b)(l), in fleeing from the troopers was to avoid apprehension. Instead, the State was only required to prove he was \u201caware\u201d that he was fleeing from the troopers. <em>N.J.S.A. </em>2C:2 \u2014 2(b)(2); <em>see State v. Speth, </em>323 <em>N.J.Super. </em>67, 87, 731 A.2d 1232 (App.Div.1999) (holding that the \u201cknowingly\u201d culpability requirement of the offense of witness tampering, which proscribes \u201cknowingly attempt[ing]\u201d to induce a witness to give false testimony (see n. 5 <em>infra), </em>can be satisfied by showing that \u201cdefendant [was] aware that he was attempting to tamper with a witness.\u201d).<footnotemark>7</footnotemark></p>\n<p id=\"b544-4\"><page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"510\">*510</page-number>In instructing the jury, the trial court provided adequate guidance concerning the \u201cknowingly\u201d culpability requirement of eluding:</p>\n<blockquote id=\"b544-5\">[T]he State must prove beyond a reasonable doubt each of the following six elements. First, that Jose Mendez was operating a motor vehicle on a street or highway in this State. Second, that Trooper Muiholland was a police or law enforcement officer. Third, that Jose Mendez knew that Trooper Muiholland was a police or law enforcement officer. Fourth, that Trooper Muiholland signaled Jose Mendez to bring the vehicle to a full stop. Fifth, that Jose Mendez knew that the officer had signaled him to bring the vehicle to a full stop. And, sixth, that Jose Mendez fled or attempted to elude the officer.</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b544-6\">Again, a person acts knowingly with respect to the attendant circumstances of his conduct if he is aware that such circumstances exist or he is aware of a high probability of their existence. Knowing or with knowledge or equivalent terms have the same meaning.</blockquote>\n<p id=\"Ab3\">Although the trial court also could have informed the jury that it had to find Jose was \u201caware\u201d he was fleeing the police during the pursuit, this requirement was implicit in the court\u2019s instructions that the State had to prove that Jose \u201cknew\u201d Trooper Muiholland was a law enforcement officer and \u201cknew\u201d that Muiholland had signaled him to stop. Moreover, it is clear that even <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"511\">*511</page-number>under Jose\u2019s own version of the events of May 8, 1998, he had the knowledge required to support his conviction for eluding. According to Jose, he knew that the persons in the State Police car were State troopers and, when the troopers activated their overhead lights, he also knew that they wanted him to stop. But despite this knowledge, he drove his car a distance of approximately five miles with the State troopers in pursuit. Therefore, the trial court did not commit plain error in instructing the jury regarding the \u201cknowingly\u201d culpability requirement of eluding.</p>\n<p id=\"b545-6\">II</p>\n<p id=\"b545-7\">Defendant Timothy Mendez\u2019s primary argument is that his conviction for tampering with physical evidence must be vacated because his release of a white powdery substance out the car window during the police chase did not constitute evidence tampering. This offense is proscribed by <em>N.J.S.A. </em>20:28-6(1), which provides:</p>\n<blockquote id=\"b545-8\">A person commits a crime of the fourth degree if, believing that an official proceeding or investigation is pending or about to be instituted, he:</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b545-9\">(1) Alters, destroys, conceals or removes any article, object, record, document or other thing of physical substance with purpose to impair its verity or availability in such proceeding or investigation____</blockquote>\n<p id=\"b545-10\">The State\u2019s theory was by releasing the white powder into the air Timothy \u201calter[ed]\u201d or \u201cdestroy[ed]\u201d the substance \u201cwith the purpose to impair its ... availability\u201d in a police investigation.</p>\n<p id=\"b545-11\">In arguing that the evidence was insufficient to support a conviction for evidence tampering, Timothy relies primarily upon our decision in <em>State v. Sharpless, </em>314 <em>N.J.Super. </em>440, 457-59, 715 A.2d 333 (App.Div.), <em>certif. denied, </em>157 <em>N.J. </em>542, 724 A.2d 802 (1998), which held that a drug dealer could not be found guilty of this offense for dropping bags containing drugs on the ground as the police approached him. The focus of our decision in <em>Sharpless </em>was the distinction between \u201cconcealfment]\u201d of evidence, which is proscribed by <em>N.J.S.A. </em>2C:28-6(1), and \u201cabandonment\u201d of evidence, which is not a crime:</p>\n<blockquote id=\"b546-4\"><page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"512\">*512</page-number>Persons who possess criminal contraband generally seek to keep it hidden from others, especially the police. It is common, for example, for drug dealers to maintain their supply of drugs some place other than on their persons. It is also common for persons who possess criminal contraband to discard it upon the approach of the police. Consequently, if such conduct were held to constitute tampering with evidence, any person in possession of contraband who took any steps to prevent the police from discovering the contraband could be charged not only with the possessory offense but also with tampering with evidence. Absent a clearer indication that this was the Legislature\u2019s intent in enacting <em>N.J.S.A. </em>2C:28~ 6, we decline to reach this conclusion. Instead, consistent with the court\u2019s interpretation of <em>N.J.S.A. </em>2C:29-3b(l) in <em>Fuqua, </em>we construe the phrase \u201cconceal[ment]\u201d of \u201cany article ... with the purpose to impair its availability in [an investigation]\u201d in <em>N.J.S.A. </em>2C:28-6 to refer only to \u201cevidence of a completed criminal act, sot a current possessory crime.\u201d <em>Fuqua, supra, </em>303 <em>N.J.Super. </em>at 47, 696 A.2d 44. Under this analysis, defendant\u2019s abandonment of his drug supply occurred during the course of his ongoing possession of heroin with the intent to distribute and consequently did not constitute tampering with evidence.</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b546-5\"><em>[Id. </em>at 459, 715 A.2d 333.]</blockquote>\n<p id=\"b546-6\">The Supreme Court of Pennsylvania\u2019s decision in <em>Commonwealth v. Delgado, </em>544 <em>Pa. </em>591, 679 A.2d 223 (1996), which we relied upon in <em>Sharpless, </em>also turned on the distinction between \u201cconcealment\u201d and \u201cabandonment\u201d of evidence. In concluding that the defendant\u2019s act of discarding drugs as he was being pursued by the police would not support a conviction for the Pennsylvania counterpart to <em>N.J.S.A. </em>20:28-6(1), the court stated:</p>\n<blockquote id=\"AmA\">[Defendant\u2019s] act of discarding contraband in plain view of the police does not rise to a level of conduct that constitutes the destruction or concealment of evidence as contemplated by the statute. The act of throwing the bag of cocaine while being chased by the police was nothing more than an abandonment of the evidence.</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b546-7\"><em>[Id. </em>at 225.]</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b546-8\">On the other hand, the Pennsylvania courts have recognized that a person who destroys or attempts to destroy drugs at the time of an arrest or police stop may be found guilty of evidence tampering. <em>See, e.g., Commonwealth v. Morales, </em>447 <em>Pa.Super, </em>491, 669 A.2d 1003, 1005-06 (1996) (affirming conviction for evidence tampering of defendant who swallowed apparent heroin when stopped by police); <em>Commonwealth v. Govens, </em>429 <em>Pa. Super. </em>464, 632 A.2d 1316, 1328-29 (1993) (affirming conviction for evidence tampering of defendant who flushed cocaine down the toilet as police entered his apartment), <em>appeal denied, </em>539 <em>Pa. </em>675, 652 A.2d 1321 (1994).</blockquote>\n<p id=\"b547-4\"><page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"513\">*513</page-number>The Tennessee Court of Criminal Appeals has construed Tennessee\u2019s counterpart to <em>N.J.S.A. </em>2C:28-6(1) in a similar manner. In <em>State v. Patton, </em>898 S.W.2d 732, 736 (Tenn.Crim.App.1994), <em>appeal denied, </em>(Tenn. 1995), the court held that a defendant who \u201ctoss[ed] aside\u201d a bag of marijuana as the police were chasing him could not be found guilty of evidence tampering because this conduct constituted \u201cmere abandonment\u201d of contraband. On the other hand, in <em>State v. Logan, </em>973 S.W.2d 279, 281-82 (Tenn.Crim. App.1998), the court affirmed a conviction for evidence tampering of a defendant who \u201csuccessfully destroyed the contents of twelve ... bags [of cocaine] by placing them in the toilet.\u201d</p>\n<p id=\"b547-5\">The courts in other jurisdictions have also held, consistent with <em>Sharpless, </em>that simply throwing away contraband as the police approach does not constitute \u201cconcealment\u201d that will support a conviction for evidence tampering, <em>see e.g., Vigue v. State, </em>987 P.2d 204, 206-11 (Alaska Ct.App.1999); <em>In re M.F., </em>315 <em>Ill.App.3d </em>641, 248 <em>Ill.Dec. </em>463, 734 N.E.2d 171, 175-79 (2000), but that swallowing drugs or other conduct that makes contraband unavailable to the police constitutes \u201cdestruction\u201d of evidence that will support a conviction for this offense. <em>See, e.g., Frayer v. People, </em>684 P.2d 927 (Colo.1984) (affirming conviction for evidence tampering for breaking bottle of narcotic cough syrup during arrest); <em>Lewis v. State, </em>56 S.W.3d 617, 624-26 (Texas Ct.App.2001) (affirming conviction for evidence tampering for swallowing cocaine during police stop of vehicle).</p>\n<p id=\"b547-6\">In this ease, the State\u2019s evidence showed that Timothy Mendez held a bag containing a white powdery substance, which the State hypothesized was cocaine, outside the window of a moving car during a police chase, allowing the substance to dissipate into the air and thus causing it to become unavailable as evidence. This conduct was comparable to swallowing or flushing drugs down a toilet, which the courts in other jurisdictions have held to constitute \u201cdestruction\u201d of evidence within the intent of evidence tampering statutes similar to <em>N.J.S.A. </em>2C:28-6(1). <em>See, e.g., Morales, supra, </em>669 A.2d at 1005-06; <em>Govens, supra, </em>632 A.2d at 1328-29; <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"514\">*514</page-number><em>Logan, supra, </em>973 S.W.2d at 281-82; <em>Lewis, supra, </em>56 S.W.3d at 624-26. Such conduct does not constitute mere abandonment of evidence and is sufficient to support a conviction for evidence tampering.</p>\n<p id=\"b548-5\">Timothy also argues that even if the State\u2019s evidence would have supported a conviction for evidence tampering, the trial court committed plain error by failing to instruct the jury that it had to find, beyond a reasonable doubt, that the evidence he allegedly tampered with was not contained in the glassine bags found in the search of the car. However, there is nothing in the language of <em>N.J.S.A. </em>2C:28-6(1) or <em>Sharpless </em>that precludes a defendant from being found guilty of tampering with evidence derived from the same source as unlawfully possessed contraband. Therefore, the jury verdict sheet question as to whether the evidence Timothy allegedly tampered with came from the same bags later found in the Mendez car was superfluous, and any error in the jury instructions relating to that question was harmless.</p>\n<p id=\"b548-6\">Ill</p>\n<p id=\"b548-7\">Defendants\u2019 other arguments do not require extensive discussion. Defendants argue that the reversal of Jose\u2019s conviction for eluding and Timothy\u2019s conviction for evidence tampering also would require the reversal of their convictions for unlawful possession of a police radio scanner, because possession of a scanner during the commission or attempt to commit another offense is one of the elements of that offense. Our affirmance of the eluding and evidence tampering convictions moots this argument. In addition, Jose argues that the seven-year term of imprisonment imposed upon him for second degree eluding was excessive. This argument is clearly without merit. <em>R. </em>2:ll-3(e)(2).</p>\n<p id=\"b548-8\">Affirmed.</p>\n<footnote label=\"l\">\n<p id=\"b538-12\"> As a result of a 1995 amendment, <em>L. </em>1995, c. 401, \u00a7 54, <em>N.J.S.A. </em>2C:29-2b now also applies to eluding by \"any vessel\" as defined in <em>N.J.S.A. 12:1-11.</em></p>\n</footnote>\n<footnote label=\"2\">\n<p id=\"b540-9\"> We recognize that a few inchoate offenses, such as possession of a weapon for an unlawful purpose, <em>N.J.S.A. </em>2C:39-4, are placed in sections of the Code outside of chapter five.
