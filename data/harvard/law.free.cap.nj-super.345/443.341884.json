We uphold the determination of the Director of the Division of Taxation that they are not, and reverse the Tax Court\u2019s decision in this case to the contrary.</p>\n<p id=\"b480-6\">I.</p>\n<p id=\"b480-7\">Defendant, the Director of the Division of Taxation, appeals from a judgment of the Tax Court, entered on April 27, 2000, in essence, rejecting the Director\u2019s assessments for the tax years 1992 and 1993 for Keogh Plan contributions.<footnotemark>1</footnotemark> The matter was tried on stipulated facts, and the issue before us is purely one of law regarding whether Keogh Plan contributions are deductible from the \u201cpartner\u2019s distributive share of partnership income\u201d (under <em>N.J.S.A. </em>54A:5-lk) for purposes of the New Jersey Gross Income Tax Act, <em>N.J.S.A. </em>54A:1-1 to 10-12. The Director argues that:</p>\n<blockquote id=\"b480-8\">The trial court incorrectly determined that taxpayers may deduct from their gross income the amounts diverted from partnership profits to a partner\u2019s personal non-[Internal Revenue Code] section 401(k) retirement plan.</blockquote>\n<p id=\"b480-11\">While \u201c[w]e generally defer to the Tax Court\u2019s expertise\u201d and have a limited scope of review following a determination of that court, <em>Little Egg Harbor Tp. v. Bonsangue, </em>316 <em>N.J.Super. </em>271, 285, 720 A.2d 369 (App.Div.1998), we must also recognize \u201cthe Director\u2019s expertise, particularly when exercised in the specialized and complex area covered by the[] provisions\u201d of the Gross Income Tax (\u201cGIT\u201d) Act. <em>Metromedia, Inc. v. Director, Div. of Taxation, </em>97 <em>N.J. </em>313, 327, 478 A.2d 742 (1984). In this case, we <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"447\">*447</page-number>must recognize the primacy of the latter and, given our scope of review, validate the Director\u2019s interpretation.</p>\n<p id=\"b481-6\">We acknowledge our concern that contributions, pursuant to an act of Congress, designed to defer the taxation of income on the federal level until distribution of the pensions are not given such treatment in New Jersey. But State taxation, like federal taxation, is a matter of statutory law and the states can tax income even if deductible or subject to an exclusion under federal tax law. The state and federal tax statutes are not parallel. <em>Smith v. Director, Div. of Taxation, </em>108 <em>N.J. </em>19, 32, 527 A.2d 843 (1987). Thus, while we should endeavor to interpret our income tax law to be consistent with federal law, in order to provide uniformity, understanding and consistency when our statute does not provide otherwise, this case requires a different result because <em>N.J.S.A. </em>54A:6-21 permits a deduction only for contributions to I.R.C. \u00a7 401(k) plans. <em>See </em>26 <em>U.S.C.A. </em>\u00a7 401. There is no dispute that the Keogh Plan involved in this case qualifies under I.R.C. \u00a7 401(a) but is not an approved plan under section 401(k).</p>\n<p id=\"b481-7\">II.</p>\n<p id=\"b481-8\">The background and facts are well detailed by the trial judge in his thorough reported opinion. <em>Reck v. Director, Div. of Taxation, </em>18 <em>N.J.Tax </em>598, 600-02 (Tax 2000). The judge concluded that the Keogh Plan contributions made by the Ernst &amp; Young partnership of which plaintiff John Reck was a member could be taken as deductions on plaintiffs 1992 and 1993 New Jersey gross income tax returns. <em>Id. </em>at 610. Ernst &amp; Young also had a qualified section 401(k) pension plan, and deductions for contributions thereto are not in dispute. <em>Reck, supra, </em>18 <em>N.J.Tax </em>at 602. As the Tax Court noted the Division\u2019s regulations for the tax years in question, and at present, permit deductibility of contributions on behalf of partners to qualified section 401 (k) plans, but not to plans which do not qualify under section 401(k). The Tax Court nevertheless concluded that the Supreme Court\u2019s opinion in <em>Koch </em><page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"448\">*448</page-number><em>v. Director, Div. of Taxation, </em>157 <em>N.J. </em>1, 722 A.2d 918 (1999),<footnotemark>2</footnotemark> and <em>\u201cN.J.S.A. </em>54A:5-lj and <em>N.J.S.A. </em>54A:6-10 and -21 necessarily incorporate! ] a determination that partnership contributions to Keogh Plans on behalf of partners are deductible business expenses under <em>N.J.S.A. </em>54A:5-lb, which defines net profits from business.\u201d <em>Id. </em>at 617. Because we do not read <em>Koch </em>as applying to a case involving retirement and pension plan contributions and believe that <em>N.J.S.A. </em>54A:6-21 is controlling, we reverse the judgment of the Tax Court.</p>\n<p id=\"b482-4\">Like all administrative regulations, the Division\u2019s regulations are entitled to a presumption of reasonableness. A person challenging a regulation, therefore, has to demonstrate that the rule is arbitrary, capricious or unreasonable. <em>See New Jersey Guild of Hearing Aid Dispensers v. Long, </em>75 <em>N.J. </em>544, 562-63, 384 A.2d 795 (1978). \u2018When an administrative agency interprets and applies a statute it is charged with administering in a manner that is reasonable, not arbitrary or capricious, and not contrary to the evident purpose of the statute, that interpretation should be upheld, irrespective of how the forum court would interpret the same statute in the absence of regulatory history.\u201d <em>Blecker v. State, </em>323 <em>N.J.Super. </em>434, 442, 733 A.2d 540 (App.Div.1999). <em>See also Smith v. Director, Div. of Taxation, supra, </em>108 <em>N.J. </em>at 25-26, 527 A.2d 843; <em>Sutton Warehousing, Inc. v. Director, Div. of Taxation, </em>290 <em>N.J.Super. </em>686, 697, 676 A.2d 615 (App.Div.1996). This is particularly so because the true meaning and intent of a provision of the GIT Act \u201cmust be read and interpreted in the <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"449\">*449</page-number>context of [legislation] as a whole.\u201d <em>Vinnik v. Director, Div. of Taxation, </em>12 <em>N.J.Tax </em>450, 453 (Tax 1992).</p>\n<p id=\"b483-6\">When examined as a whole, the GIT Act establishes a tax on New Jersey gross income reduced only by deductions, exemptions and credits expressly recognized by the Legislature. <em>Vinnik, supra, </em>12 <em>N.J.Tax </em>at 453-54. Thus, \u201c[t]axation is the rule and exemption is the exception to the rule[,][and][t]he legislative design to release one from his just proportion of the public burden [must] be expressed in clear and unequivocal terms.\u201d <em>AT &amp; T Co. v. Director, Div. of Taxation, </em>13 <em>N.J.Tax </em>534, 543 (Tax 1993); <em>see also Princeton University Press v. Borough of Princeton, </em>35 <em>N.J. </em>209, 214,172 A.2d 420 (1961). To the extent that plaintiffs seek to establish a deduction from taxable gross income, they have the burden of establishing a clear statutory basis therefor. <em>See Amerada Hess Corp. v. Director, Div. of Taxation, </em>107 <em>N.J. </em>307, 319-20, 526 A.2d 1029 (1987), <em>aff'd, </em>490 <em>U.S. </em>66, 109 <em>S.Ct. </em>1617, 104 L.Ed.2d 58 (1989); <em>Metpath, Inc. v. Director, Div. of Taxation, </em>96 <em>N.J. </em>147, 153, 474 A.2d 1065 (1984); <em>Princeton University Press, supra, </em>35 <em>N.J. </em>at 214,172 A.2d 420.</p>\n<p id=\"b483-7\">III.</p>\n<p id=\"b483-8\">Partnerships, as such, are not subject to taxation under the New Jersey GIT Act. <em>See N.J.S.A. </em>54A:2-2. Rather, partnership earnings are \u201cpassed through\u201d to the partners, who are subject to income tax as individuals. <em>N.J.S.A. </em>54A:5-4; <em>see also </em>N.J.S.A. 54A:2-1. Under the Act, gross income includes each New Jersey resident\u2019s \u201c[distributive share of partnership income.\u201d <em>N.J.S.A. </em>54A:5-lk.<footnotemark>3</footnotemark> Although distributive share of partnership income is <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"450\">*450</page-number>not expressly defined in the GIT Act, \u201cthe Legislature intended profits earned in the ordinary course of business of a partnership to be treated similarly to profits earned in the ordinary course of business of a proprietorship____\u201d <em>Smith v. Director, Div. of Taxation, supra, </em>108 <em>N.J. </em>at 28, 527 A.2d 843. As the Supreme Court has said, \u2018\u201cinsofar as income derived from a business conducted in [sole] proprietorship or partnership form is concerned, [the GIT Act] imposes a tax on net income.\u2019 \u201d <em>Id. </em>at 26-27, 527 A.2d 843 (quoting <em>Smith v. Director, Div. of Taxation, </em>7 <em>N.J.Tax </em>187, 194 (Tax 1984)). Therefore, each partner\u2019s derivative share of the \u201cnet profits\u201d from the operation of a partnership is included in each partner\u2019s individual gross income. <em>See N.J.S.A. </em>54A:5-lb (defining \u201cnet profits from business\u201d).<footnotemark>4</footnotemark> Hence, gross income includes \u201cnet income from the operation of a business, profession or other activity after provision for all costs and expenses incurred in the conduct thereof, determined either on a cash or accrual basis in accordance with the method of accounting allowed for federal income tax purposes____\u201d <em>N.J.S.A. </em>54A:5-lb.</p>\n<p id=\"b484-6\">In <em>Sabino v. Director, Div. of Taxation, </em>296 <em>N.J.Super. </em>269, 275, 686 A.2d 1197 (App.Div.1996), we explained that \u201c \u2018all costs and expenses\u2019 are not deductible simply because the business incurred them. They must be \u2018ordinary\u2019 business expenses.\u201d We expressly rejected the notion that \u201c \u2018all costs and expenses\u2019 as used in <em>N.J.S.A. </em>54A:5-lb means, virtually, any and all expenses of a business, whether related or unrelated to the conduct of that business.\u201d <em>Ibid. </em>Therefore, in order to be deductible, a cost or expense must be incurred in the ordinary and regular course of the operation of the partnership\u2019s business.</p>\n<p id=\"b485-5\"><page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"451\">*451</page-number>The regulations in effect for the years in question<footnotemark>5</footnotemark> explained the taxability of Keogh Act contributions as follows:</p>\n<blockquote id=\"b485-6\">(f) Keogh Plan:</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b485-7\">1. Contributions by a partnership to a Keogh Plan made on behalf of employees deductible as ordinary and necessary business expenses for federal income tax purposes are deductible for New Jersey gross income tax purposes in determining the net income of a partnership. The employees on whose behalf such contributions to a Keogh Plan were made by the partnership are not subject to gross income tax on such amounts contributed by their employer until withdrawals from the Keogh Plan are made by them. The employees are not deemed to have actually or constructively received the employer contributions at the time they were made to the Keogh Plan. At the time of withdrawal by an employee both the employer contribution and accumulated interest is subject to tax.</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b485-8\">2. Contributions by the partnership to a Keogh Plan made on behalf of the partners are not a deductible business expense on the partnership return. Such Keogh contributions made by the partnership on behalf of the individual partners are taxable income to th[e] individual partners for New Jersey gross income tax purposes. There is no provision in the gross income tax law for the deduction of such partnership Keogh contributions. These amounts are not subject to tax when subsequently withdrawn by the partners.</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b485-9\">3. The interest income accumulated on the contributions made to a Keogh Plan on behalf of the partners is not subject to tax during the period of a partner\u2019s participation. Such interest shall become subject to tax at the time of withdrawal from the plan by the participant. When periodic withdrawals are made by a partner, the accumulated interest in the plan is subject to tax in the ratio that the interest bears to the total amount in the partner\u2019s account.</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b485-10\">[N.J.AC. 18:35-1.14(f).]</blockquote>\n<p id=\"b485-11\">The following \u201cexample\u201d was included in the regulation:</p>\n<p id=\"b485-12\">Example 2:</p>\n<blockquote id=\"b485-13\">A partnership makes a contribution to a Keogh Plan on behalf of the partners for $3,000 and on behalf of the employees for $4,500. The partnership may deduct the $4,500 contribution on behalf of the employees as a business expense for the taxable year and the employees will not include the $4,500 as income until withdrawal is made from the Keogh Plan. The partnership cannot deduct the $3,000 contribution made on behalf of the partners as a business expense for the <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"452\">*452</page-number>taxable year. Each partner must include his share of the $3,000 as a distributive share of partnership income in the taxable year the contributions are made. The $3,000 will not be taxable to the partners when withdrawal is made by them.<footnotemark>6</footnotemark></blockquote>\n<p id=\"b486-4\">It is reasonable for the Director to conclude that contributions to Keogh Plans made on behalf of a partner constitute a portion of the partnership\u2019s profits otherwise distributable to the individual partner and, thus, are not an ordinary business expense. Moreover, the former and present regulations, to the effect that-Keogh Plan contributions made on behalf of a partner are not deductible business expenses, are also consistent with the controlling statute, <em>N.J.S.A. </em>54A:6-21, and the controlling precedent.</p>\n<p id=\"AYK\"><em>N.J.S.A. </em>54A:6-21 provides:</p>\n<blockquote id=\"b486-5\">Gross income shall not include amounts contributed by an employer on behalf of and at the election of an employee to a trust which is part of a qualified cash or deferred arrangement which meets the requirements of section 401\u00ae of the 1954 Internal Revenue Code [26 <em>U.S.C.A </em>\u00a7 401\u00ae, as amended.]</blockquote>\n<p id=\"b486-6\"><em>Mutch v. Division of Taxation, </em>9 <em>N.J.Tax </em>612 (Tax 1988), <em>aff'd, o.b., </em>11 <em>N.J.Tax </em>87 (App.Div.1989), held that employer contributions to a Simplified Employee Pension Plan (\u201cSEP\u201d) are not deductible from the employee\u2019s gross income. The Tax Court, affirmed by us, concluded that the taxpayer\u2019s \u201cSEP plan is not included within [Internal Revenue Code] section 401(a) plans but instead it is one type of an individual retirement account (IRA) permitted under section 408 and it is less complex than a qualified retirement plan under section 401(k).\u201d <em>Mutch, supra, </em>9 <em>N.J.Tax </em>at 618. The contributions were, therefore, not subject to taxation, as claimed by the taxpayer, \u201conly when the funds are finally withdrawn.\u201d <em>Id </em>at 619. According to Judge Lario:</p>\n<blockquote id=\"b487-5\"><page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"453\">*453</page-number>Contrarily, because of the clear distinction between the two sections, by explicitly limiting only section 401(k) contributions from gross income in the 1983 amendment, N.J<em>.S.A. </em>54A:6-21, the Legislature clearly indicated its intent to limit that exclusion only to those plans.</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b487-6\">[9 <em>N.J.Tax </em>at 619.]</blockquote>\n<p id=\"b487-7\">In <em>Dantzler v. Director, Div. of Taxation, </em>18 <em>N.J.Tax </em>490, 492 (Tax 1999),<footnotemark>7</footnotemark> the Tax Court had to decide, among other issues, whether \u201ccertain <em>non-k01(k) pension contributions </em>of Mr. Dantzler\u2019s law partnership [were] deductible from his taxable distributive share of partnership income[.]\u201d In holding in the negative, the <em>Dantzler </em>court relied on <em>N.J.S.A. </em>54A:6-21, which, by its express terms, applies only to contributions made to a deferred compensation plan which qualified under <em>I.R.C. </em>section 401(k).</p>\n<p id=\"b487-8\">The significance of <em>N.J.S.A. </em>54A:6-21 was recently emphasized by Judge Small in <em>Sidman v. Director, Div. of Taxation, </em>18 <em>N.J.Tax </em>636, 637 (Tax 2000), which held that \u201ca taxpayer may [not] deduct interest on a loan, the proceeds of which were used to purchase shares in a New Jersey subchapter S corporation, from his <em>pro rata </em>share of the S corporation\u2019s income.\u201d In distinguishing <em>Koch v. Director, Div. of Taxation, </em>157 <em>N.J. </em>1, 722 A.2d 918 (1999), upon which the taxpayer and Tax Court relied in this case, Judge Small in <em>Sidman </em>wrote:</p>\n<blockquote id=\"b487-9\">Prior to the enactment of <em>N.J.S.A. </em>54A:6-21, no pension plan contributions were deductible for New Jersey GIT purposes. Due to pressure by businesses with <em>iOl (k) plans </em>to have the contributions to those plans exempt from taxation for New Jersey GIT purposes, <em>they and only they were exempted.</em></blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b487-10\"><em>[Id. </em>at 645 n. 1 (citing <em>Mutch v. Director, Div. of Taxation, </em>9 <em>N.J.Tax </em>at 619 (emphasis added).)]</blockquote>\n<p id=\"b487-11\">Judge Small quoted the fiscal note referred to in the Assembly Committee Statement to the bill which became <em>N.J.S.A. </em>54A:6-21:</p>\n<blockquote id=\"A9q\">Fiscal Impact. The Division of Taxation states that there are no available data to offer a reasonable estimate; however, it was stated that this may result in a $1 million loss in <em>revenue____The division commented that these types of plans are </em><page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"454\">*454</page-number><em>only one of many which, if in the future receive the same treatment, could result in revenue losses that could be quite substantial.</em></blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b488-5\"><em>IIbid. </em>(emphasis added).]</blockquote>\n<p id=\"b488-6\">In light of this legislative history resulting in <em>N.J.S.A. </em>54A:6-21, the Tax Court in <em>Sidman </em>concluded that:</p>\n<blockquote id=\"b488-7\">To extend the reading of N.J.S.A. 54A:6-21 to incorporate federal concepts of pension deductibility on the basis of <em>Koch [v. Director, Div. of Taxation, </em>157 <em>N.J. </em>1, 722 A.2d 918 (1999)] goes beyond the intention <em>of </em>the Legislature in enacting <em>N.J.S.A. </em>54A:6-21 and the limited ruling in <em>Koch. ... </em>The Legislature acknowledged in the above-quoted statement that these other plans <em>might </em>receive this treatment in the future. No amendments to <em>N.J.S.A. </em>54A:6-21 have been made since 1983.</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b488-8\"><em>[Sidman, supra, </em>18 <em>N.J.Tax </em>at 645 n. 1.]</blockquote>\n<p id=\"b488-9\">Our recent affirmance of the Tax Court in <em>Sidman </em>compels our reversal here. In holding that the taxpayer could not deduct interest on the loan used to purchase shares of his subchapter S-corporation although he could do so for federal tax purposes, we said:</p>\n<blockquote id=\"b488-10\">The New Jersey gross income tax was conceived as a tax on gross income, not net. <em>Smith v. Dir., Div. of Taxation, </em>108 <em>N.J. </em>19, 32, 527 A.2d 843 (1987). The legislative history of the Act reveals that the Legislature wished to limit deductions as a way of avoiding the tax shelters and \u201cloopholes\u201d found in the federal tax laws. <em>Id </em>at 30-31, 527 A.2d 843.</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b488-11\">Moreover, statutes granting exemptions and deductions from taxation are strictly construed against those claiming the exemption or deduction. <em>INDOPCO, Inc. v.

Neeld; </em>9 <em>N.J. </em>349, 353, 88 A.2d 500 (1952). To exempt property from a tax burden, the legislative intent must be expressed in the statute in clear and unmistakable terms. <em>Neeld, supra, </em>9 <em>N.J. </em>at 353, 88 A.2d 500. A taxpayer seeking a deduction must be able to point to an applicable statute and show that he or she comes within its terms. <em>INDOPCO, supra, </em>503 <em>U.S. </em>at 83,112 <em>S.Ct. </em>at 1043, 117 <em>L.Ed2d </em>at 233-34. \u201cThe predicate for this principle is that the existence of government depends on tax revenues; without such revenues government cannot function.\u201d <em>Metpath, Inc. v.

Our opinion in <em>Sidman, </em>like the trial court opinions in <em>Sidman </em>and this case, post-date <em>Koch, </em>and we do not read <em>Koch, </em>which dealt with accounting principles regarding the cost basis of a partnership interest, to involve a question relating to pension or retirement plan contributions. Moreover, given the general principles of New Jersey tax law and the relevant legislative history of <em>N.J.S.A. </em>54A:6-21, quoted by Judge Small, we read the express authorization for the deductibility of section 401 (k) contributions to preclude similar treatment of other types of pension and retirement plans, although not expressly prohibited. <em>See also N.J.S.A. </em>54:6-10.</p>\n<p id=\"b489-6\">As explained in <em>Mutch, supra, </em>9 <em>N.J. Tax </em>at 619, \u201cby explicitly limiting only section 401(k) contributions from gross income in ... <em>N.J.S.A. </em>54A:6-21, the Legislature clearly indicated its intent to limit that exclusion only to those plans. .Had the Legislature intended to confer a similar benefit to\u201d other plans recognized by the Internal Revenue Code \u201cit could easily and effectively have done so by merely adding the [necessary] words\u201d to <em>N.J.S.A. </em>54A:6-21, which (despite other amendments to the GIT Act) has not been amended despite <em>Mutch </em>and the later cases since 1983. Accordingly, consistent with our affirmances in <em>Mutch </em>and <em>Sid-man, </em>we now hold that plaintiffs Keogh Act contributions are not deductible for New Jersey gross income tax purposes.</p>\n<p id=\"b489-7\">The judgment is reversed.</p>\n<footnote label=\"1\">\n<p id=\"b480-12\"> The judgment actually modifies assessments which included an adjustment for deductions of interest on loans taken to fund plaintiff John Reek\u2019s capital contribution to his employer, Ernst &amp; Young, which the Director does not pursue on this appeal.</p>\n</footnote>\n<footnote label=\"2\">\n<p id=\"b482-5\"> In <em>Koch, </em>the Supreme Court was called upon to determine \"the proper method for calculating a taxpayer\u2019s cost basis for a partnership interest and, specifically, whether that cost basis should be the purchase price or the taxpayer\u2019s federal adjusted basis ...,\u201d 157 <em>N.J. </em>at 3, 722 A.2d 918.
