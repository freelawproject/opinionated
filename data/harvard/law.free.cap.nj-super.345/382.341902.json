On February 13, 1997, Passaic County Sheriffs Officer Leonard Arcieri and his partner, Nick Casasanta, were on fugitive writ duty in Paterson. They were in plain clothes and in an unmarked car and were to apprehend persons sought on fugitive arrest warrants. Shortly <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"386\">*386</page-number>after 4:00 p.m., the officers were on East 23rd Street when they observed a female, later identified as defendant, and a man talking on the corner approximately thirty feet from the officers. Defendant appeared to be a fugitive wanted on a warrant, one \u201cAnto-nette Malavarca.\u201d Arcieri then witnessed the male hand something to defendant which appeared to be small square objects.</p>\n<p id=\"b420-5\">After receiving the items, defendant got into the driver\u2019s seat of a black car parked at the corner of the intersection. Anthony Spino was a passenger in the car. The ear, originally believed to be a Pontiac Firebird, turned out to be a Chevrolet Camaro, a car similar in design to a Firebird. Defendant drove off and Arcieri and Casasanta followed to determine if defendant was the subject of the fugitive warrant.</p>\n<p id=\"b420-6\">After proceeding about a block and a half, defendant stopped at a red light on 11th Avenue and Madison, whereupon the undercover police car came up alongside defendant. Arcieri, driving the car, was alongside the passenger side of defendant\u2019s car, about five feet or less from defendant. The detective looked over to see defendant holding something in her right hand, against her stomach. It appeared she had small plastic baggies consistent with cocaine packages with which the officer was familiar from over four years experience on the narcotics squad. The passenger, Spino, was also looking in the direction of defendant\u2019s lap.</p>\n<p id=\"b420-7\">Arcieri then knocked on the Camaro\u2019s passenger side window, displaying the badge which hung on a chain around his neck. He advised defendant to shut off the car. Rather than complying, defendant drove out of the traffic lane, over a double yellow line and went around the car in front that was waiting at the red light. At that point, Arcieri activated the police lights and siren and followed defendant as she sped through several red lights and stop signs. Arcieri testified that there was heavy traffic in the area and defendant was traveling at a high rate of speed. After the detectives lost sight of defendant, they notified headquarters that the vehicle may be entering Route 80.</p>\n<p id=\"b421-5\"><page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"387\">*387</page-number>At that time, Sheriffs Department Detectives Raymond Manko-vich and Kevin Huha were in the area of Route 80 in Totowa and were also in plain clothes and in an unmarked vehicle. They heard the radio transmission in which Arcieri related being involved in the pursuit of a black Firebird (or Camaro) that was possibly now on Route 80. They drove to the Union Boulevard overpass over Route 80, where Mankovich exited to scan the traffic in the westbound lanes. Mankovich spotted defendant\u2019s car weaving in and out of traffic at a much higher speed than the flow of other traffic.</p>\n<p id=\"b421-6\">The Camaro left Route 80 at the northbound Union Boulevard exit ramp near the detectives and they immediately followed the car. They stayed behind the car without lights or sirens in order to see if it was the vehicle in question. Defendant drove down a driveway in a retail shop parking lot toward the rear of the building. Mankovich and Huha followed and spotted the car in the rear parking area approximately twenty-five yards away facing the driveway entrance. Upon receiving confirmation from headquarters on the description and plate number, Huha activated the emergency lights.</p>\n<p id=\"b421-7\">Mankovich had started to exit the police vehicle when defendant observed the detectives\u2019 vehicle and accelerated head-on toward the officers. As Huha swerved to avoid a collision, defendant drove past the detectives\u2019 vehicle and went back up the driveway to turn onto Union Boulevard southbound. The officers went in pursuit using the flashing head lights, the emergency light on the dashboard and the siren. Defendant\u2019s vehicle was in the right lane and was attempting to get through the traffic to the left-turn lane. Huha pulled the police vehicle into the left lane as well and blocked defendant\u2019s vehicle at a slight angle by cutting to the right in front of her vehicle.</p>\n<p id=\"b421-8\">Mankovich exited his vehicle. With his badge hanging from his neck chain and his hand on his firearm, he yelled at defendant to shut off the car and exit her vehicle. Suddenly, defendant backed up and then drove forward toward him. As the car came forward, <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"388\">*388</page-number>Mankovich was struck by the left front quarter panel of the car. Meanwhile, Huha had also exited the police vehicle. He was at the rear of the Camaro when it first went into reverse. Anticipating further pursuit, Huha started to go back to the police car. He then heard the screech of the tires, Mankovich yell, and \u201ca popping sound\u201d as defendant\u2019s driver side window broke. Huha observed Mankovich partially inside the Camaro\u2019s driver side window, fighting with defendant. It was later determined that the popping noise was caused by the breaking of the driver\u2019s window by some part of Mankovich\u2019s body as he was hit by the vehicle. Mankovich had attempted to get to the gear shift lever while screaming at defendant to shut off the vehicle. At the same time, he heard the engine revving loudly and screamed \u201cget your foot off the gas,\u201d while battling defendant for the gear shift.</p>\n<p id=\"b422-5\">The Camaro finally went into neutral and came to rest with a \u201clight tap\u201d on the police car. Mankovich began battling with defendant. He ultimately grabbed her hair and pulled her out of the Camaro through the window. She was pushed up against the Camaro and told to put her hands on the roof. Defendant continually removed her hands from the roof of the car. Manko-vich had to use his left hip to keep her against the vehicle as he put his firearm back into his holster. Once he replaced his gun, Mankovich handcuffed defendant. Huha had gone back around the Camaro to cover the male passenger, Spino. Prior to Huha handcuffing the passenger, Mankovich saw them speaking. Telling defendant not to move, Mankovich went to ask Huha why he had not yet handcuffed and removed Spino from the car. Huha advised him that Spino reported having recently had heart surgery. Mankovich directed Spino to exit the vehicle and then he was handcuffed by Huha.</p>\n<p id=\"b422-6\">Arcieri and his partner eventually arrived on the scene and identified defendant, the passenger, and the car as the parties and vehicle involved in the earlier chase. As Arcieri stood near defendant\u2019s vehicle with Huha, Huha observed \u201csome white objects\u201d in the area of the vehicle where the roof line ends and the <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"389\">*389</page-number>glass hatch begins. Hnha removed three small zip-lock baggies containing a white substance that tested positive for cocaine.</p>\n<p id=\"b423-5\">Mankovich\u2019s knees began to ache after his return to the police station. He discovered his legs were bloody and injured from the knees to the ankles. X-rays did not reveal a fracture, but he was told to see a physician and not to return to work. Subsequently, the pain continued and he had two surgeries on his legs with the condition ultimately stabilizing. He now has problems, however, with steep stairs and on loose surfaces such as sand at the beach. Further, he stated he has been rendered unable to run.'</p>\n<p id=\"b423-6\">The defense was premised on denying defendant had engaged in any drug transaction, any reckless driving or any attempt to elude the police. Defendant maintained that she was only trying to get away from the suspicious vehicle that was following her and that she was unaware it contained sheriffs detectives. Spino testified that he and defendant went to the Paramus Mall on Route 17 where defendant shopped while he stayed in the car or walked about the parking lot. He testified that they left the mall via Route 80 where defendant became stuck in traffic and got off the highway because she knew a short cut. Defendant also needed gas and cigarettes, so they stopped at a gasoline station. He stated that shortly thereafter they were stopped at a traffic light when a car pulled up along the right and an occupant of that car seemed to be yelling to pull over. Spino testified that upon informing defendant of this, the light changed and she \u201ctook off.\u201d He denied ever being aware that either vehicle contained sheriff officers.</p>\n<p id=\"b423-7\">According to Spino, Mankovich jumped out of his car with gun drawn, ran around the front of the Camaro and bumped into the fender. Spino testified that defendant was calmly complying with Mankovich\u2019s directives, but that the detective kept yelling and finally just smashed the window. Spino denied being aware of any drugs in the car, denied defendant purchased drugs in Paterson, and also denied defendant fought with the officer prior to being taken out of the vehicle.</p>\n<p id=\"b424-4\"><page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"390\">*390</page-number>Based on the above, defendant was convicted of the charges previously noted. This appeal followed.</p>\n<p id=\"b424-5\">II</p>\n<p id=\"b424-6\">Relevant to the issues raised by defendant in point one, is the time frame involved during the jury deliberations. Deliberations began on May 18, 1999, at 3:16 p.m. and went until 4:00 p.m. Day two was May 19, 1999, and deliberations lasted most of the day with a read back consuming about half an hour. Day three was May 20, 1999, and the jury arrived after 12:00 p.m. and a requested read back consumed most of the afternoon with approximately fifteen minutes of deliberation before the jury recessed. Day four, May 21, 1999, was a full day of deliberations. Day five began with a response to a jury note and deliberations began at 9:57 a.m. The jury then asked for a read back of Huha\u2019s testimony and reinstruction. The reinstruction was given in the afternoon and the jury was excused for the day at 2:45 p.m.</p>\n<p id=\"b424-7\">May 25, 1999, day six, began with the read back and deliberations commenced at 10:22 a.m. The jury recessed at about 4:00 p.m. Day seven, May 26, 1999, was a full day of deliberations. Day eight, May 28, 1999, began at 9:22 a.m. with a requested reinstruction on the burden of proof given during the morning, and the jury recessed for the day, at its request, at 2:05 p.m. Day nine, June 1,1999, began at 11:11 a.m. with a note sent out by the jury at 11:50 a.m. The judge responded to the note by giving a modified Allen<footnotemark>1</footnotemark> charge. Deliberations resumed at 12:27 p.m. and ended for the day at 3:11 p.m. Day ten, June 2, 1999, commenced at 9:55 a.m. and concluded about 3:15 p.m. At the start of day eleven, June 3,1999, the jury had spent approximately seven days and two-and-a-half hours deliberating. June 3, 1999, the eleventh calendar day of deliberations, began at 10:20 a.m. after an instruction from the judge. The jury had a question at 11:30 a.m. that indicated it was close to a verdict on all counts but needed <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"391\">*391</page-number>reinstruction on the definition of attempt. The instruction was given and the jury resumed deliberating at 12:16 p.m. A verdict was reached at 12:30 p.m.</p>\n<p id=\"b425-6\">As a corollary, the length of the trial bears mention. On May 11, 1999, the jury was empaneled, given standard legal instructions and allowed to leave. May 12 and 13,1999, included opening statements and then full days of testimony. May 14, 1999, was a half day with the jury excused at 12:30 p.m. On May 17, 1999, testimony resumed at 10:00 a.m. and went until late afternoon when all trial testimony was completed. May 18, 1999, began at 10:00 a.m. and included the closing arguments and the jury charge. The jury received the case at 3:16 p.m. All in all, the trial consumed approximately four days.</p>\n<p id=\"b425-7\">Defendant contends that the length of the deliberations was excessive and that this was a sure sign that the jury was having difficulty reaching a verdict. Further, defendant asserts that the judge\u2019s failure to give guidance to the \u201cstruggling\u201d jury at the first sign of difficulty, denied defendant a fair trial.</p>\n<p id=\"b425-8\">Specifically, defendant contends that on the fifth day of deliberations, a note, sent out by one juror to the judge, clearly indicated that the jury was struggling with a verdict and that the judge was bound to give the instruction mandated in <em>State v. Czachor, </em>82 <em>N.J. </em>392, 413 A.2d 593 (1980). Defendant argues that the failure to give the <em>Czachor </em>charge was plain error meriting reversal and a remand for a new trial. Defendant, however, failed to raise this point before the trial judge. In fact, defense counsel specifically agreed with the judge\u2019s resolution of the juror\u2019s note.</p>\n<p id=\"b425-9\">The note sent out from Juror 13 stated:</p>\n<blockquote id=\"b425-10\">Honorable Judge Clark: When I was assigned and sworn into this case, I gave my word to do my best and do my part to the best of my ability. That has never changed. It remains paramount in my mind. Because of this fact, I have (2) questions about court procedures which apply to any and \u201cany\u201d is circled, \u201cany criminal case.\u201d And underlines \u201ccriminal.\u201d</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b425-11\">Number one. With the eight counts in this case, if? and he underlines \u201cit\u201d with a question mark, if the jury cannot agree [unanimously] in say one or two of the <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"392\">*392</page-number>counts, does this constitute a \u2018hung\u2019 jury? Or, is it possible to be partially \u2018hung\u2019 on a couple of the counts?</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b426-5\">Two. What are the times when it is legal to utilize an alternate juror relevant to (avoiding) a so-called \u2018hung\u2019 jury. Or are the alternate and a hung jury mutually exclusive subjectsfevents?</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b426-6\">If you think it necessary, can you please discuss these questions with the two lawyers and, at your discretion, read what could/should be read for the record, if any part of this.</blockquote>\n<p id=\"b426-7\">The judge discussed the question with both attorneys and stated: \u201c[t]he juror is not saying we are hung, the juror is saying what happens <em>if </em>we are hung, so I don\u2019t think it is a situation where I start reading them the <em>Allen </em>charge.\u201d<footnotemark>2</footnotemark> (emphasis added.) The judge went on to say that she would answer the question in \u201cstrict legal terms as he has asked,\u201d i.e., verdicts on some counts but not on other ones are acceptable and use of the alternate would be inappropriate.</p>\n<p id=\"b426-8\"><em>Rule </em>1:7-2 states that in order to preserve questions for review, at the time a ruling or order is made, a party must make known to the court his objection to the action taken and grounds therefor. Defendant not only did not object, but concurred, agreeing that the note did not reflect a deadlocked jury. Despite that, we review defendant\u2019s claim under the plain error standard. Under <em>Rule </em>2:10-2, \u201c[a]ny error or omission shall be disregarded by the appellate court unless it is of such a nature as to have been clearly capable of producing an unjust result.\u201d</p>\n<p id=\"b426-9\">The <em>Czachor </em>Court developed guidelines for trial judges in the event of jury deadlock in criminal cases. 82 <em>N.J. </em>at 404, 413 A.2d 593. The opinion directed that in situations where the jury has been unable to reach unanimous verdicts, the court should instruct the jury in accordance with ABA Standards \u00a7 5.4. <em>Id. </em>at 407, 413 A.2d 593. The instruction should be given in the initial <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"393\">*393</page-number>charge, which the judge did, here, and repeated at the judge\u2019s discretion. <em>Ibid. </em>The judge\u2019s discretion should be guided by \u201csuch factors as the length and complexity of trial and the quality and duration of the jury\u2019s deliberations.\u201d <em>Ibid.</em></p>\n<p id=\"b427-6\">There was clearly no obligation to give the <em>Czachor </em>charge when the juror sent the note. While defendant points to the fact that it was the fifth day of deliberations, the reality is that only May 19 and 21,1999, were full days, while May 18,1999, consisted of barely forty-five minutes of deliberation and May 20, 1999, consisted of approximately three-and-a-half hours of the read back of testimony and only fifteen minutes of deliberations. The note referred to above was received and responded to on May 24,1999, before any deliberations began. In essence, the jury had only deliberated two days and approximately one hour at that point. Furthermore, the note did not express actual deadlock or inability to agree on any of the charges. The note merely sought clarification on the ability of the jury to return a verdict on some, but not all of the charges if that circumstance became a reality.</p>\n<p id=\"b427-7\">Here, there was no report of a \u201cdefinite deadlock after a reasonable period of deliberations.\u201d <em>Czachor, </em>82 <em>N.J. </em>at 407, 413 A.2d 593. Assuming, <em>arguendo, </em>that the judge contemplated the need for an instruction applying the factors mentioned in <em>Czachor, </em>the record supports her decision not to give it. While the trial was not complex, it spanned six calendar days, with approximately four days worth of actual trial. Up to that point, the jury had deliberated one full day; reheard the testimony of the State\u2019s main witness, Arcieri, and defendant\u2019s main witness, Spino, at their request; and then deliberated another day. The note came at the outset of the next day. The jury was obviously actively considering key components of each side\u2019s case. The judge acted well within her discretion in not instructing the jury in accordance with <em>Czachor.</em></p>\n<p id=\"b427-8\">Defendant also argues that at that same \u201ccritical moment,\u201d the judge failed to properly advise the jury when it appeared that it may have reached a partial verdict. Defendant relies upon <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"394\">*394</page-number><em>State v. Shomo, </em>129 <em>N.J. </em>248, 609 A.2d 394 (1992), as support for this proposition.</p>\n<p id=\"b428-5\"><em>Shomo </em>addressed the circumstance where a jury announced its verdict on the first two of four charges under consideration without being instructed on the finality of the partial verdicts. After hearing the partial verdicts, the court gave a modified <em>Czachor </em>charge and released the jury for the evening. <em>Id. </em>at 252, 609 A.2d 394. The next day, the judge received several notes. The first asked about guilt by admission and the second relayed that the jury was not going to reach a unanimous verdict on the remaining counts and asked \u201cwhat is our next step?\u201d <em>Ibid. </em>The judge also received a note from a juror indicating a desire to \u201cchange\u201d his vote on the first count. <em>Id. </em>at 253, 609 A.2d 394. Our Supreme Court held that before a court receives a partial verdict, it should unambiguously instruct the jury that a partial verdict will be considered final, not subject to reconsideration, even though the jury continues to deliberate on other counts. <em>Id. </em>at 258, 609 A.2d 394.</p>\n<p id=\"b428-6\">Here, defendant\u2019s reliance on <em>Shomo </em>is misplaced. The note on May 24, 1999, did not declare a final resolution to any of the counts, nor did it declare a present inability of the jury to reach a unanimous verdict. Furthermore, it did not ask the judge for guidance as to what step it should take next due to a deadlock. The note simply asked what exactly a \u201chung\u201d jury was and whether there was such a thing as being \u201cpartially hung.\u201d Thus, <em>Shomo </em>is distinguishable and no instruction on finality of partial verdicts was necessary here.</p>\n<p id=\"b428-7\">Ill</p>\n<p id=\"b428-8\">Next, we address defendant\u2019s claim that the judge gave an instruction that coerced the guilty verdicts on May 28, 1999, when the jury sought additional instruction on burden of proof. The judge discussed answering the question with the attorneys and neither party urged the judge to give the <em>Czachor </em>charge at that time. Later in the day, the judge noted the length of the <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"395\">*395</page-number>deliberations. While recognizing that there must be some disagreement between jurors, she stated, \u201cI do not detect that the jury is tremendously tense or doesn\u2019t want to [come] back.\u201d She further noted:</p>\n<blockquote id=\"b429-6\">At this point if they told me they were hung on one or more counts, I very probably would not tell them to make any further deliberations after this length____I would probably not give them an <em>Allen </em>charge or anything of that nature after this type of effort.</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b429-9\">I just don\u2019t know that it is appropriate for me to say anything to them. I can honestly say I never had deliberations of this length, particularly on a case that took essentially two or two and a half days of testimony, but I\u2019m just not at the point where I\u2019m ready to say anything to them.</blockquote>\n<p id=\"b429-10\">The prosecutor agreed with the judge and defense counsel stated, \u201cit would appear that they know what a hung jury is. For whatever reason, they are somewhere between no verdict, and verdict, and hung.\u201d The jury then requested to recess for the day. The judge stated that she did not want to put pressure on the jury. She noted, however, that the jurors asked to come back, \u201cso at least in their minds it appears they think that they will reach verdicts.\u201d The judge obviously took this as a positive sign that the jury was making progress.</p>\n<p id=\"b429-11\">The jury resumed deliberations on June 1, 1999. Shortly after deliberations began, the judge received a note to the effect that further consideration on four unresolved counts could lead to a change of votes on the resolved counts. At this point, the judge gave the modified <em>Allen </em>charge with the agreement of counsel.</p>\n<p id=\"b429-12\">At the end of the day on June 2, 1999, defendant made a motion for a mistrial based upon the length of deliberations. The judge reserved judgment until the following day, but noted that she was very \u201cdisinclined to declare a mistrial before I try saying something to them and then giving it another half day or whatever.\u201d She instructed counsel to think about her instructing the jury the following day.</p>\n<p id=\"b429-13\">On June 3, 1999, the judge denied the motion for a mistrial on the basis that there had not yet been any formal communica<page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"396\">*396</page-number>tion that the jury was deadlocked. She opted to give the modified <em>Allen </em>charge again and stated to the jury:</p>\n<blockquote id=\"b430-5\">Ladies and gentlemen, I believe that there comes a point when the judge, who is not only the judge of the law, but, in effect, the supervisor or manager of the trial, should indicate that deliberations should come to an end. No Court would ever do this lightly, but I think given the length of deliberations that I should raise this issue with you.</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b430-6\">Ladies and gentlemen, I have decided to indicate to you that as of three p.m. today, if you are still deliberating, I will call you out and I\u2019ll ask your forelady, as your representative, whether she believes that any further deliberations will result in a verdict on one or more counts. If she says no, then I will declare a mistrial, in effect, a hung jury. If she says yes, then I will allow some additional period of deliberations, and I\u2019ll make up my mind as to how long if I reach that situation. Ladies and gentlemen, I stress to you that these remarks are not intended in any way to inappropriately pressure the jury to reach consensus on any count if you cannot do so, it is simply a recognition that deliberations have been lengthy and that placing reasonable limitations on deliberations is appropriate.</blockquote>\n<p id=\"b430-7\">Defendant asserts that these remarks improperly pressured the jury into returning guilty verdicts. Defendant claims that the statement was so coercive that the jury could not have possibly felt that they were permitted to \u201cdeliberate objectively, freely, and with an untrammeled mind.\u201d <em>Czachor, </em>82 <em>N.J. </em>at 402, 413 A.2d 593.</p>\n<p id=\"b430-8\">At the outset, we note that we have been unable to find a case that addresses what the trial judge should do in a situation like this. This is a rather uncomplicated case, essentially involving credibility. There was no statement from the jury that it was deadlocked, yet it was out deliberating over eleven calendar days. Several cases discuss when a directive to the jury is or is not appropriate in the context of the court receiving word from the jury that it is deadlocked. We now address those cases.</p>\n<p id=\"b430-9\">In <em>State v. Nelson, </em>304 <em>N.J.Super. </em>561, 701 A.2d 726 (App.Div.1997), the trial judge received a note that the jury was deadlocked. <em>Id. </em>at 563, 701 A.2d 726. We held that while it was appropriate for the judge to send the jury back out to deliberate, imposition of a forty-five minute deadline before the judge would declare a mistrial, and then delivery of a verdict within that time frame clearly was coercive. <em>Id. </em>at 566, 701 A.2d 726.</p>\n<p id=\"b431-4\"><page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"397\">*397</page-number>Here, however, the judge\u2019s supplemental instruction informed the jury that at 3:00 p.m. she would inquire whether further deliberations would be helpful. She did not in any way imply that 3:00 p.m. was a deadline for the final verdict. In fact, she stated that further deliberation would be allowed if the jury so desired.</p>\n<p id=\"b431-5\">In <em>State v. Ramseur, </em>106 <em>N.J. </em>123, 524 A.2d 188 (1987), the Court held that the trial judge did not abuse its discretion in concluding that a note indicating deadlock, but asking for suggestions \u201cclearly indicated the jury did not regard itself as deadlocked.\u201d <em>Id. </em>at 302, 524 A.2d 188. The Court added that \u201cperhaps the trial court should have explored with the jury whether it had deliberated sufficiently and had reached a genuine stalemate, a point at which any further deliberations would have been counterproductive.\u201d <em>Id. </em>at 304, 524 A.2d 188.</p>\n<p id=\"b431-6\">Here, there was no deadlock note. The <em>Ramseur </em>language, however, provides support for the trial judge\u2019s remarks. Considering the length of the jury\u2019s deliberations, the judge told the jury that she would explore with it in approximately five hours whether further deliberation would result in verdicts, or whether further deliberation would be counterproductive. Her comments were consistent with the language in <em>Ramseur </em>and appropriate considering the judge\u2019s role in a jury trial.</p>\n<p id=\"b431-7\">Defendant argues that the judge should have been careful in her exercise of the power of comment, <em>State v. Jones, </em>104 <em>N.J.Super. </em>57, 62, 248 A.2d 554 (App.Div.1968), <em>certif. denied, </em>53 <em>N.J. </em>354, 250 A.2d 755 (1969), and avoided \u201ctip[ping] the scale\u201d against the accused by commenting. <em>State v. Corbo, </em>32 <em>N.J. </em>273, 276, 160 A.2d 625 (1960). We conclude that the judge\u2019s remarks were carefully calculated to protect the sanctity of the deliberations that had occurred up to that point and did not amount to a \u201ccoercive time limit\u201d as defendant purports.</p>\n<p id=\"b431-8\">In <em>State v. Childs, </em>204 <em>N.J.Super. </em>639, 499 A.2d 1041, <em>certif. denied, </em>104 <em>N.J. </em>430, 517 A.2d 423 (1985), we noted that any suggestion that the jury was coerced into reaching a verdict after being returned by the judge to deliberate was rebutted by the fact <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"398\">*398</page-number>that the jury deliberated for four hours before it reached a verdict that could be regarded as favorable to defendant. <em>Id. </em>at 648, 499 A.2d 1041. Here, the same observation can be made. After the instruction was given, the jury continued to deliberate for approximately an hour and a half; asked for reinstruction on attempt; and then deliberated for about twenty more minutes before returning verdicts, some of which were favorable to defendant. Thus, the verdicts demonstrate an absence of judicial coercion as in <em>Childs.</em></p>\n<p id=\"b432-5\">In <em>State v. Harris, </em>156 <em>N.J. </em>122, 716 A.2d 458 (1998), <em>cert. denied,</em>\u2014U.S.\u2014, 121 <em>S.Ct. </em>2204, 149 L.Ed.2d 1034 (2001), the Court held that the trial court did not coerce the minority of jurors into accepting the majority\u2019s position after sending them back to deliberate more upon receipt of a deadlock note. <em>Id. </em>at 184, 716 A.2d 458. The Court expressly noted that the supplemental instruction clearly instructed the jurors not to change their opinions simply to agree with other jurors or to \u201csurrender a view honestly held.\u201d <em>Ibid.</em></p>\n<p id=\"b432-8\">Here, the judge gave the jury essentially the same instruction. The judge said in part: \u201cbut do not surrender your honest conviction as to the weight or effect of evidence solely because of the opinion of your fellow jurors or for the mere purpose of returning verdicts.\u201d We cannot conclude that the judge\u2019s remarks coerced a jury verdict. No error \u201cclearly capable of producing an unjust result\u201d occurred. <em>R. </em>2:10-2.</p>\n<p id=\"b432-9\">\n<em>IV</em>\n</p>\n<p id=\"b432-10\">In point two, defendant asserts that her convictions for eluding should be reversed because during the instructions on the eluding charge, the judge did not define the word attempt as used in the eluding statute. Defendant did not object before the trial judge and therefore we must conclude that the judge\u2019s failure in this regard was of no moment, and not \u201cclearly capable of producing an unjust result.\u201d <em>R. </em>2:10-2. The judge advised the jury of the definition of \u201cattempt\u201d in connection with the instructions on <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"399\">*399</page-number>aggravated assault. We are satisfied that the jury could have inferred that the same definition applied to the eluding counts as well. Considering the circumstances of this case, no reversible error occurred in this regard. <em>See State v. Jordan, </em>147 <em>N.J. </em>409, 422, 688 A.2d 97 (1997).</p>\n<p id=\"b433-5\">V</p>\n<p id=\"b433-6\">Next, defendant asserts that her conviction for possession of cocaine was against the weight of the evidence. Defendant\u2019s claim is barred procedurally because no motion for a new trial on this ground was made in the trial court. <em>R. </em>2:10-1.</p>\n<p id=\"b433-7\">In addition to being barred procedurally, the claim lacks substantive merit. The record reflects ample evidence for the jury to find defendant guilty beyond a reasonable doubt of possession of cocaine. The jury is free to accept or reject, in whole or in part, any aspect of testimonial evidence based on credibility. <em>State v. Coleman, </em>46 <em>N.J. </em>16, 43, 214 A.2d 393 (1965), <em>cert. denied, </em>383 <em>U.S. </em>950, 86 <em>S.Ct. </em>1210, 16 L.Ed.2d 212 (1966). Here, the jury obviously believed the State\u2019s witnesses.</p>\n<p id=\"b433-8\">VI</p>\n<p id=\"b433-9\">Finally, defendant asserts that her sentence is excessive. We conclude that the findings of fact regarding aggravating and mitigating factors were based on competent and credible evidence in the record; that the judge did not apply incorrectly the sentencing guidelines enunciated in the Code; and that in applying the facts to the law, the judge reached a conclusion that could have been made upon a weighing of the relevant factors. <em>State v.
