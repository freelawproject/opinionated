We therefore reverse defendant\u2019s murder conviction and remand for a new trial on that offense. Because defendant will have to be retried on the murder charge, we address the admissibility of certain portions of decedent\u2019s diary and a certain letter written by decedent, that were admitted into evidence by the State. We also address certain sentencing issues that the State concedes are errors and the applicability of the No Early Release Act (\u201c\u00d1ERA\u201d), <em>N.J.S.A. </em>20:43-7.2, to a murder conviction in the event defendant is convicted of that offense following a retrial.</p>\n<p id=\"b294-8\">I</p>\n<p id=\"b294-9\">Following a jury trial, defendant was convicted of murder, <em>N.J.S.A. </em>2C:ll-3a(l) and (2); hindering apprehension, <em>N.J.S.A. </em>2C:29-3; fourth degree theft of a credit card, <em>N.J.S.A. </em>2C:21-6c; and four counts of third degree unlawful use of a credit card, <em>N.J.S.A </em>2C:21-6d. The victim of the murder and the credit card offenses was defendant\u2019s girlfriend, Lora M. Freyer. At sentencing, the judge determined that NERA applied to defendant\u2019s murder conviction and imposed a life term with a sixty-three and three-quarter year period of parole ineligibility. A consecutive five-year term with a two-year parole bar was imposed on the hindering apprehension conviction. A consecutive eighteen-month <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"261\">*261</page-number>term with a nine-month period of parole ineligibility was imposed on the theft of the credit card conviction. Fifteen-month terms with six months of parole ineligibility were imposed on each of the unlawful use of a credit card convictions, to be served concurrently with each other but consecutively to the other sentence. Defendant\u2019s aggregate sentence was life imprisonment plus seven years and nine months, with a sixty-seven-year parole bar.</p>\n<p id=\"b295-6\">II</p>\n<p id=\"b295-7\">On appeal defendant raises the following contentions:</p>\n<blockquote id=\"b295-8\">\n<em>POINT I</em>\n</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b295-9\">THE JUDGE\u2019S CHARGE IMPROPERLY REDUCED THE STATE\u2019S BURDEN OF PROOF TO A STANDARD LOWER THAN BEYOND A REASONABLE DOUBT AND THEREBY VIOLATED DEFENDANT\u2019S RIGHTS TO DUE PROCESS OF LAW AND A FAIR TRIAL. <em>(U.S. CONST. </em>AMENDS.

They had lived together since March 1996, and became engaged in 1997. In April 1998, they moved together to an apartment in Sayreville.</p>\n<p id=\"b296-10\">Defendant and Freyer were having difficulties with their relationship preceding Freyer\u2019s death. Their troubles centered around defendant\u2019s loss of employment, his drug use and his taking money from Freyer to support his drug use. Freyer was pregnant at the time of her death. Freyer\u2019s pregnancy also added a further strain to their relationship.</p>\n<p id=\"b296-11\">Two days after Freyer\u2019s death, defendant notified her mother that Freyer was pregnant and missing from their apartment. Freyer\u2019s mother advised defendant to notify the police, which he did.</p>\n<p id=\"b296-12\">Freyer\u2019s body was discovered on August 25,1998, by an individual who was walking in the woods at Bailey Park in Sayreville. The police were notified and subsequently interviewed defendant. At police headquarters, defendant voluntarily provided a tape recorded statement about having reported Freyer missing and said that he had last seen Freyer at 7:00 p.m. on August 24, 1998.</p>\n<p id=\"b296-13\">Subsequently, the police interviewed defendant\u2019s cousin, George Carty. Carty told police he and defendant smoked cocaine everyday from mid to late August 1998. Carty explained that he had moved into defendant\u2019s and Freyer\u2019s apartment and that on August 23, 1998, at approximately 10:00 p.m., defendant and Freyer had left the apartment. When they left, they were arguing. Carty told police that defendant returned to the apartment at 11:30 p.m. and said that Freyer was at her father\u2019s home. Carty never saw Freyer again. Further, Carty told police that <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"263\">*263</page-number>when defendant returned to the apartment, he had no bruises or scratches and his clothes were not disheveled.</p>\n<p id=\"b297-6\">The police officers who interviewed Carty and defendant compared their statements and noticed a discrepancy with respect to the last time defendant saw Freyer. Defendant was then interviewed again. He was given his Miranda<footnotemark>1</footnotemark> warnings and voluntarily waived his rights and gave an oral statement to the police.</p>\n<p id=\"b297-7\">In his statement, defendant admitted that he had lied about when he had last seen Freyer. He acknowledged that he and Freyer argued over his drug use and the fact that he had lost his job because of his drug use.</p>\n<p id=\"b297-8\">He told police that he and Freyer drove to Bailey Park to talk. He acknowledged that they continued to argue and then Freyer \u201csmacked him with an open hand.\u201d He said he \u201cgrabbed [Freyer] by the neck\u201d with his open right hand and \u201cthrew her backwards, causing her to fall down an embankment.\u201d</p>\n<p id=\"b297-9\">Defendant further told the police that:</p>\n<blockquote id=\"b297-10\">He went down to cheek on her, and he found she was not breathing. He believed that she was dead at that point. He then indicated that he dragged the body by the arms down the hill further to a wooded area, and he covered her up with a cardboard box that was in the area.</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b297-11\">He then indicated that he panicked during the situation. He did not know what else to do with her. He also indicated that Carty was not present during this incident.</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b297-12\">He further indicated that at no time did he seek medical aid for Lora Freyer, and that he did believe that she was dead at that point. He also indicated that he never returned back to the scene.</blockquote>\n<p id=\"b297-13\">Defendant admitted to using Freyer\u2019s credit cards after her death.</p>\n<p id=\"b297-14\">After defendant\u2019s oral statement, he agreed to provide a tape-recorded statement. He was, again, given his <em>Miranda </em>warnings. In the taped statements, although defendant admitted that he killed Freyer, he said he pushed her by the neck to get her \u201cto stop smacking [him].\u201d He claimed the contact with Freyer\u2019s neck was only a couple of seconds, just \u201cto hold her off [him].\u201d He was <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"264\">*264</page-number>unable to say whether he grabbed her neck tightly or loosely, but admitted that his hand went around her neck.</p>\n<p id=\"b298-5\">Following defendant\u2019s arrest, the police confirmed that defendant had used Freyer\u2019s credit card four times after her death, withdrawing $760 from her bank account on August 24, and 25, 1998. All of the withdrawals occurred at the same bank.</p>\n<p id=\"b298-6\">On August 26,1998, the police received Freyer\u2019s diary from her mother. The diary detailed Freyer\u2019s conflicts with defendant over drugs, money, his lack of employment, his absences from the apartment, and his theft of her credit card to withdraw money from her account. On August 19,1998, Freyer wrote in the diary that because of defendant\u2019s actions, she was going to leave him. A letter that Freyer wrote to defendant, but never mailed, was also found in the diary. In the letter she spoke about their problems and her pregnancy and defendant\u2019s \u201cneed to get a job to help [her].\u201d Certain portions of the diary and the entire letter were admitted into evidence.</p>\n<p id=\"b298-7\">The State produced an expert, Jack Titus, M.D., a forensic pathologist, on the cause of Freyer\u2019s death. He testified that Freyer died because of \u201casphyxiation due to neck compression,\u201d or \u201cstrangulation.\u201d</p>\n<p id=\"b298-8\">Defendant did not testify but produced an expert, Arkady Katsnelson, M.D., a forensic pathologist. He concluded that Frey-er died from \u201casphyxiation due to vasovagal reflex.\u201d He explained that \u201ca blow to Freyer\u2019s neck activated the vagal nerve that caused her heart rate [to] slow down.\u201d The slower heart rate caused \u201cthe output of blood from the heart [to] be much slower,\u201d resulting in an insufficient amount of oxygen to the brain. The brain is not able to function without oxygen and the result is death.</p>\n<p id=\"b298-9\">IV</p>\n<p id=\"b298-10\">Defendant argues for the first time on appeal that the judge\u2019s charge on murder \u201cimproperly reduced the State\u2019s burden <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"265\">*265</page-number>of proof to a standard lower than beyond a reasonable doubt and thereby violated defendant\u2019s rights to due process of law and a fair trial.\u201d Because this issue was not raised below, defendant must show that the error was \u201cclearly capable of producing an unjust result.\u201d <em>R. </em>2:10-2. The error must be \u201csufficient to raise a reasonable doubt as to whether the error led the jury to a result it otherwise might not have reached.\u201d <em>State v. Macon, </em>57 <em>N.J. </em>325, 336, 273 A.2d 1 (1971).</p>\n<p id=\"b299-5\">Plain error asserted in connection with the jury charge is a:</p>\n<blockquote id=\"AIA\">legal impropriety in the charge prejudicially affecting the substantial rights of the defendant and sufficiently grievous to justify notice by the reviewing court and to convince the court that of itself the error possessed a clear capacity to bring about an unjust result.</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b299-6\"><em>[State v. Hock, </em>54 <em>N.J. </em>526, 538, 257 A.2d 699 (1969), <em>cert. denied, </em>399 <em>U.S. </em>930, 90 <em>S.Ct. </em>2254, 26 <em>L.Ed. </em>2d 797 (1970).]</blockquote>\n<p id=\"b299-8\"><em>See also State v. Jordan, </em>147 <em>N.J. </em>409, 422, 688 A.2d 97 (1997).</p>\n<p id=\"b299-9\">Here, the trial judge initially instructed the jury on murder and the lesser-included offenses of passion/provocation manslaughter, <em>N.J.S.A. </em>2C:llAb(2); manslaughter, <em>N.J.S.A. </em>2C:ll^tb(l); and aggravated manslaughter, <em>N.J.S.A. </em>2C:ll-4a. In addition, he charged the jury on the doctrines of self-defense, <em>N.J.S.A. </em>2C:3^, and imperfect self-defense, <em>N.J.S.A. </em>2C:3-9.</p>\n<p id=\"b299-10\">The challenged portion of the charge was given with respect to the murder count only. The judge said:</p>\n<blockquote id=\"b299-11\">The nature of the purpose or knowledge with which Mr. Chavies acted towards Ms. Freyer is a question of fact for you, the jury, to decide.</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b299-12\">Purpose and knowledge are conditions of the mind. They can not be seen. They can only be determined by inferences from conduct, words or acts.</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b299-13\">Sound familiar? It\u2019s the third time that I\u2019ve told you that. Therefore, it is not necessary for the State to produce a witness or witnesses to testify that Mr. Chavies stated, for example, that he intended or his purpose was to cause death or <em>serious </em>bodily injury resulting in death.</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b299-14\">It is within your power to find that proof of purpose or knowledge has been furnished beyond a reasonable doubt by inferences which may arise from the nature of the acts and the surrounding circumstances.</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b299-15\">Such factors as the place where the acts occurred. Any weapon that was used. The location. Number and nature of the wounds inflicted, and all that was done or <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"266\">*266</page-number>said preceding Mr. Chavies, connected with and immediately succeeding the events leading to the death of Ms. Freyer are among the circumstances to be considered.</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b300-5\">\n<em>A homicide in itself may permit you to draw an inference, if you wish to, that Mr. Chavies\u2019 purpose to take life or cause serious bodily injury resulting in death.</em>\n</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b300-6\">\n<em>If you are satisfied beyond a reasonable doubt that Mr. Chavies killed Ms. Freyer, you may draw such an inference from the manner and circumstances of the killing as to his purpose and knowledge.</em>\n</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b300-7\">[ (emphasis added).]</blockquote>\n<p id=\"b300-8\">Defendant did not object to this instruction. This instruction was given to the jury just prior to the time it commenced its first deliberations at approximately 3:36 p.m. on February 8, 2000. The jury deliberated until 4:56 p.m. that day. The jury was discharged at that time for the day and told to return the next day to resume deliberations.</p>\n<p id=\"b300-9\">The same charge, however, was given on two more occasions to the jury, without objection. The next morning, February 9, 2000, the jury requested further instructions on murder and the lesser-included offenses. The judge recharged the jury at 10:55 a.m. He repeated the above instruction.</p>\n<p id=\"b300-10\">Thereafter, in the afternoon of February 9, 2000, the jury sent the following note to the judge: \u201cDear Judge, we are a hung jury. The decision is eleven to one. No further evidence will convince the lone juror. Please advise.\u201d After speaking with counsel and concluding that the jury deliberations had not been lengthy at that point, the judge instructed the jurors about their duties in accordance with <em>State v. Czachor, </em>82 <em>N.J. </em>392, 413 A.2d 593 (1980)<footnotemark>2</footnotemark>, and sent them back to resume their deliberations. At 4:05 p.m. that same day, the jury again sent a note to the judge that said, \u201cplease list the three components of Murder and Aggravated Manslaughter.\u201d The jury was dismissed for the day to accommodate a personal obligation of one of the jurors, with the judge to address the jury\u2019s question the next day.</p>\n<p id=\"b301-5\"><page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"267\">*267</page-number>The following morning, February 10, 2000, the judge addressed the jury\u2019s question and repeated his charge on murder and the lesser-included offenses. Again, the judge instructed the jury in accordance with the presently-challenged instructions noted above. Two and one-half hours after receiving this instruction for the third time, the jury convicted defendant of murder.</p>\n<p id=\"b301-6\">We recognize, when reviewing an alleged error concerning the charge, \u201cthat portions of a charge alleged to be erroneous cannot be dealt within isolation but the charge should be examined as a whole to determine its overall effect.\u201d <em>State v. Wilbely, </em>63 <em>N.J. </em>420, 422, 307 A.2d 608 (1973). In doing that, we are satisfied that the challenged charge was \u201cclearly capable of producing an unjust result.\u201d <em>R. </em>2:10-2.</p>\n<p id=\"b301-7\">On three separate occasions, the jury was essentially told that \u201ca homicide in itself\u201d would allow the jury to conclude that defendant murdered Freyer. This is an incorrect statement of our law. Homicide is \u201c[t]he killing of one person by another.\u201d <em>Black\u2019s Law Dictionary </em>739 (7th ed.1999). \u201cThe legal term for killing a man, whether lawfully or unlawfully, is homicide. There is no crime of \u2018homicide.\u2019 \u201d <em>Ibid.</em></p>\n<p id=\"b301-8\">Further, our criminal code defines criminal homicide as \u201cmurder, manslaughter or death by auto.\u201d <em>N.J.S.A. </em>2C:ll-2b. If the trial judge\u2019s instruction was a correct principle of the law, then our code\u2019s definition of homicide would have required him to charge the challenged instruction with respect to the lesser-included homicide offenses, which he did not do.</p>\n<p id=\"b301-9\">Here, there was sufficient evidence to support a charge of self-defense. Self-defense that results in a death is a homicide but it does not allow a jury to infer that the actor committed a murder. Self-defense, if proven, is a justifiable homicide for which there is no criminal liability. <em>See N.J.S.A. </em>2C:3-4.</p>\n<p id=\"b301-10\">Defendant\u2019s self-defense claim makes the instruction here even more problematic. Defendant conceded that he committed a \u201chomicide,\u201d but did so in self-defense. The instruction permitted <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"268\">*268</page-number>the jury to infer from the homicide itself defendant\u2019s purposeful or knowing state of mind even if the jury was in doubt about whether other facts established the requisite element of minder. We also note that the erroneous instruction could have had a great impact on the jury\u2019s ability to reach a verdict on one of the lesser-included offenses for which there was sufficient evidence warranting instruction on these offenses. We can perceive particularly such an impact on the jury\u2019s ability to convict defendant of passion/provocation manslaughter, where the State bears the burden to prove beyond a reasonable doubt that defendant did not kill in the heat of passion. <em>See State v. Mauricio, </em>117 <em>N.J. </em>402, 412, 568 A.2d 879 (1990).</p>\n<p id=\"b302-5\">The State argues that any error in the charge was harmless because the judge repeatedly told the jury of the State\u2019s burden to establish defendant\u2019s guilt beyond a reasonable doubt. It also points to the language following the critical language here where the judge said:</p>\n<blockquote id=\"b302-6\">[i]f you are satisfied beyond a reasonable doubt that Mr. Chavies killed Ms. Freyer, you may draw such an inference from the manner and circumstances of the killing as to his purpose and knowledge.</blockquote>\n<p id=\"b302-9\">The State argues that this language meant that if the jury was satisfied that defendant killed Freyer, committed a homicide, then it could draw an inference that defendant\u2019s purpose was to take a life or cause serious bodily injury, resulting in death from the manner and circumstances of the killing. It argues essentially that this language ameliorates the now challenged instruction. We can reach no such conclusion here, considering the number of times the erroneous instruction was repeated, defendant\u2019s defense to the murder charge and the possibility of the jury finding defendant guilty of one of the lesser-included offenses had the jury been instructed properly.</p>\n<p id=\"b302-10\">Appropriate and proper charges to a jury are essential to a fair trial. <em>State v. Burgess, </em>154 <em>N.J. </em>181, 712 A.2d 681, (1998). Because proper charges are so essential, \u201c[e]rroneous instructions are poor candidates for rehabilitation as harmless, and are ordinarily presumed to be reversible error.\u201d <em>State v. Afanador, </em>151 <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"269\">*269</page-number><em>N.J. </em>41, 54, 697 A.2d 529 (1997); <em>State v. Brown, </em>138 <em>N.J. </em>481, 572, 651 A.2d 19 (1994). The charge here constitutes reversible error.</p>\n<p id=\"b303-6\">The overall effect of the challenged charge was to dilute the State\u2019s burden of proving each and every element of murder beyond a reasonable doubt. Trial judges must refrain from giving instructions that lessen the State\u2019s burden of establishing each and every element of the crime beyond a reasonable doubt. <em>State v. Biegenwald, </em>106 <em>N.J. </em>13, 41, 524 A.2d 130 (1987). To permit a charge to lessen the State\u2019s burden in a criminal case is a violation of the due process clause of the United States Constitution, <em>In re Winship, </em>397 <em>U.S. </em>358, 364, 90 <em>S.Ct. </em>1068, 25 L.Ed.2d 368 (1970), and the long standing rule of law in New Jersey \u201cthat antedates any suggestion that the Constitution compels that burden.\u201d <em>Biegenwald, supra, </em>106 <em>N.J. </em>at 59, 524 A.2d 130. We therefore reverse defendant\u2019s murder conviction and remand for a new trial.</p>\n<p id=\"b303-7\">V</p>\n<p id=\"b303-8\">Because we reverse defendant\u2019s murder conviction, we address defendant\u2019s claim that portions of Freyer\u2019s diary and a letter contained therein were erroneously read into evidence. The State argued that the redacted portion of Freyer\u2019s diary and a letter written to defendant, but never received by him, should be read to the juiy as evidence of Freyer\u2019s state of mind. The judge agreed and allowed the reading of this material to the jury. The actual documents were not admitted into evidence.</p>\n<p id=\"b303-9\">Our review of the record convinces us that the trial judge erred and the error was highly prejudicial. At defendant\u2019s retrial, this material should not be put before the jury.</p>\n<p id=\"b303-10\">The portions of the diary and the entire letter were introduced before the jury by an agent of the prosecutor. The dates in the diary testified to were from July 7, 1998 to August 20, 1998. The following colloquy took place at trial:</p>\n<blockquote id=\"b304-4\"><page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"270\">*270</page-number>THE COURT: All right. Ms. Heitmann [prosecutor], as I understand it, Miss Smith is going to read the entry in that notebook which begins on July 7th, is that correct?</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b304-5\">MS. HEITMANN: That\u2019s correct, Judge.</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b304-6\">THE COURT: Would you do so please?</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b304-7\">A.

Yes.</blockquote>\n<p id=\"b305-26\">Next, the prosecutor\u2019s agent was allowed to read to the jury the letter written by Freyer. The letter said:</p>\n<blockquote id=\"b305-27\">\u201cWell, I still can\u2019t figure out what is wrong with you. I guess you forgot to call again, but then you get mad when I remind you. In case you\u2019re wondering, I write <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"272\">*272</page-number>to you so I don\u2019t have to bother to talk to you. I don\u2019t know when you are telling the truth or when you\u2019re not. Now I\u2019m worried about you because of what you said yesterday.</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b306-5\">\u201cAs much as I hate you for all the things you do to me, I still don\u2019t want anything to happen to you. But I have realized I don\u2019t have to blame you anymore because I can leave. I don\u2019t have to stay. I get paid Friday, so I can use that check and probably leave.</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b306-6\">\u2018You keep telling me you don\u2019t want me to go but I can\u2019t keep feeling bad for myself because of you. I was going to go out tonight with someone from work but I\u2019m not. I can go out all I want if I leave. So can you. There is no point for me to stay. You don\u2019t want to be here with me and you don\u2019t want to work. All you want to do is get high. But don\u2019t forget, I\u2019m still pregnant and you need to get a job to help me.</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b306-7\">I was crying last night but not about you. I\u2019m not going to cry over you any more. I was crying because I realized I don\u2019t have to be here. I don\u2019t have to let you do this to me. I\u2019ll still worry about you while I\u2019m here but I\u2019m not going to cry over you any more.</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b306-8\">\u201cIf you really do love me and want me to stay, you need to change. No more lies. No more disappearing. You also need to realize I\u2019m pregnant. You should act like you are interested. I feel like you don\u2019t care. I feel like you don\u2019t care I\u2019m pregnant. I guess if you don\u2019t care now, you won\u2019t care after the baby is bom.</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b306-9\">\u2018You did not call me at all yesterday 8/18. I left a note for you to call me at work. You didn\u2019t call. I know you were here and you saw the note. It is now seven. I really hope you call me today. I can\u2019t believe how much you have hurt me and how much you keep doing it. It has only gotten worse.</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b306-10\">\u201cI want to be with you but I can\u2019t let you do this to me. You have no respect for me. I would just like to know why you did this to me. If I don\u2019t hear from you today, it\u2019s over. Don\u2019t worry about seeing me or the baby. Not like you care.\u201d</blockquote>\n<p id=\"b306-11\">The trial judge gave the following instruction to the jury with respect to the diary entries and the letter:</p>\n<blockquote id=\"b306-12\">The diary is not offered to prove that the contents of the diary are true. The diary is being proved to show what the state of mind was of Ms. Freyer on the various dates that are reflected in the diary. I wanted to emphasize that point.</blockquote>\n<p id=\"b306-13\">Although the instruction did not mention the letter, we presume that the instruction was intended to apply to the letter as well.</p>\n<p id=\"b306-14\">The state of mind exception to the hearsay rule provides:</p>\n<blockquote id=\"b306-15\">Then existing mental, emotional or physical condition. A statement made in good faith of the declarant\u2019s then existing state of mind, emotion, sensation, or physical condition (such as intent, plan, motive, design, mental feeling, pain, or bodily health), but not including a statement of memory or belief to prove the fact remembered or believed unless it relates to the execution, revocation, identification, or terms of declarant\u2019s will.</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b306-16\"><em>[N.J.R.E. </em>803(c)(3).]</blockquote>\n<p id=\"b307-5\"><page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"273\">*273</page-number>To be admissible as state of mind, the declarant\u2019s state of mind must be relevant to an issue in the case. <em>State v. Downey, </em>206 <em>N.J.Super. </em>382, 390-91, 502 A.2d 1171 (App.Div.1986); <em>State v. Prudden, </em>212 <em>N.J.Super. </em>608, 613, 515 A.2d 1260 (App.Div.1986). Here, Freyer\u2019s state of mind was not a relevant issue to be decided by the jury.</p>\n<p id=\"b307-6\">The State argued that because of defendant\u2019s self-defense claim, Freyer\u2019s state of mind was relevant. We reject this position. There was no issue here that Freyer so feared defendant that she was an unlikely aggressor so as to counter defendant\u2019s claim to self-defense. <em>See Downey, supra, </em>206 <em>N.J.Super. </em>at 391, 502 A.2d 1171. If that were so, a recognized exception would make decedent\u2019s state of mind relevant. As we observed in <em>Downey, </em>\u201cno relevant issue was presented as to the victim\u2019s state of mind prior to or at the time of the murder. The important fact here was the state of mind of the defendant, not that of the deceased.\u201d <em>Ibid. </em>Moreover, the diary entries and the letter were not probative of the issue of defendant\u2019s self-defense claim.</p>\n<p id=\"b307-7\">Moreover, some of the material in the diary and letter constituted other-crimes evidence, <em>N.J.R.E. </em>404(b), particularly, references to defendant\u2019s drug use and stealing Freyer\u2019s money. For this type of evidence to be admissible, the following tests must be met:</p>\n<blockquote id=\"b307-8\">1. The evidence of the other crime must be admissible as relevant to a material issue;</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b307-9\">2. It must be similar in kind stnd reasonably close in time to the offense charged;</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b307-10\">3. The evidence of the other crime must be clear and convincing; and</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b307-11\">4. The probative value of the evidence must not be outweighed by its apparent prejudice.</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b307-12\"><em>[State v. Cofield, </em>127 <em>N.J. </em>328, 338, 605 A.2d 230 (1992) (citation omitted).]</blockquote>\n<p id=\"ANV\">Furthermore, the material issue must be genuinely disputed and must \u201cbe necessary for the [disputed issues\u2019] proof.\u201d <em>State v. Marrero, </em>148 <em>N.J. </em>469, 482, 691 A.2d 293 (1997) (quoting <em>State v. Stevens, </em>115 <em>N.J. </em>289, 301, 558 A.2d 833 (1989)). When the judge engages in the weighing of the probative value of other-crimes <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"274\">*274</page-number>evidence, it considers whether other less-inflammatory evidence is available to establish the same issue. <em>Marrero, supra, </em>148 <em>N.J. </em>at 482, 691 A.2d 293.</p>\n<p id=\"b308-5\">Here, the <em>Cofield/Marrero </em>test is not met. There was already evidence of defendant\u2019s drug use and his illegal use of Freyer\u2019s credit card before the jury by way of defendant\u2019s confession and the testimony of other State witnesses. Therefore, the references to defendant\u2019s drug use and stealing Freyer\u2019s money in her diary should not have been admitted, nor should they be admitted in any re-trial.</p>\n<p id=\"b308-6\">We are also persuaded that the letter, which contained references to Freyer\u2019s pregnancy, was highly prejudicial and should not have been admitted. There was evidence of her pregnancy before the jury from defendant\u2019s confession and from the State\u2019s expert pathologist who performed the autopsy on Freyer. We fail to perceive how this additional evidence of Freyer\u2019s pregnancy was relevant to any issue to be decided by the jury. We conclude that such additional evidence on this topic and the other \u201cstate of mind evidence\u201d had the capacity to engender in the jury deep sympathy for Freyer.</p>\n<p id=\"b308-7\">Further, the judge\u2019s jury instruction with respect to the diary and letter was incorrect and inadequate. As to its incorrectness, the judge told the jury that the evidence was not admitted for the truth of the matter asserted. <em>N.J.R.E. </em>803(c)(3) is the exception to the hearsay rule that permits state of mind evidence to be introduced at trial. By definition, an exception to the hearsay rule authorizes the admission of the evidence for the truth of the matter asserted. <em>See N.J.R.E. </em>801(c) and <em>N.J.R.E. </em>802. If evidence is not offered for the truth of the matter asserted, then it is not hearsay, <em>N.J.R.E. </em>801(c), and no exception to the hearsay rule, such as <em>N.J.R.E. </em>803(c)(3), would be needed to introduce the evidence at trial. We wonder, of course, that if the evidence is not being offered for the truth of the matter asserted, then what is its relevance?</p>\n<p id=\"b309-5\"><page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"275\">*275</page-number>Although the prosecutor agreed with the judge that the evidence was not being offered for the truth of the matter asserted, her closing argument belies that position. In summation, she told the jury it had \u201cheard [Freyer\u2019s] diary____The diary is offered, folks, for you to hear what [Freyer] would have told you if she could come here and testify about what she thought was going on in the relationship.\u201d Further, the prosecutor reminded the jury about one of the entries in the diary where Freyer noted she found out defendant \u201cstole her credit card pin number and authorized [her] card, then lied about it.\u201d These remarks by the prosecutor were followed by reference to the indictment, charging defendant with unlawful use of Freyer\u2019s credit card. These references in the prosecutor\u2019s summation hardly bespeak of not using the diary and letter for the truth of the matters asserted in those documents.</p>\n<p id=\"b309-8\">Finally, on this issue, the judge\u2019s charge was inadequate, especially with respect to that part of this evidence that constituted other-crimes evidence. Even if we concluded that the other-crimes evidence was admissible, which we do not, we would still find that error occurred.</p>\n<blockquote id=\"b309-9\">When other-crime evidence is admitted, \u201cthe court must instruct the jury on the limited use of the evidence.\u201d <em>Cofield, supra, </em>127 <em>N.J. </em>at 340-41, 605 A.2d 230; <em>see also Stevens, supra, </em>115 <em>N.J. </em>at 304, 558 A.2d 833. Because of the inherently prejudicial nature of other-crime evidence, the court\u2019s instruction \u201c\u2018should be formulated carefully to explain precisely the permitted and prohibited purposes of the evidence, with sufficient reference to the factual context of the case to enable the jury to comprehend and appreciate the fine distinction to which it is required to adhere.\u2019 \u201d <em>Cofield, supra, </em>127 <em>N.J. </em>at 341, 605 A.2d 230 (quoting <em>Stevens, supra, </em>115 <em>N.J. </em>at 304, 558 A.2d 833).</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b309-10\"><em>[Marrero, supra, </em>148 <em>N.J. </em>at 495, 691 A.2d 293.]</blockquote>\n<p id=\"b309-11\">The judge\u2019s charge here did not satisfy the standard for instructions concerning other-crimes evidence.</p>\n<p id=\"b309-12\">VI</p>\n<p id=\"b309-13\">In defendant\u2019s third point, he asserts that the judge erred in failing to require the jury to make a specific finding on the hindering apprehension conviction because the count in the indict<page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"276\">*276</page-number>ment was predicated on two different factual circumstances. The State charged that defendant hindered his own apprehension by covering Freyer\u2019s body with a cardboard box and reporting her missing thirty-six hours after he knew she was dead.</p>\n<p id=\"b310-5\">This point is raised for the first time on appeal. To grant defendant relief, we must conclude that any error in this regard was \u201cclearly capable of producing an unjust result.\u201d <em>R. </em>2:10-2. We can reach no such conclusion here. Defendant conceded during summation that both factual predicates had been established.</p>\n<p id=\"b310-6\">Further, ordinarily, a general instruction on jury unanimity will be sufficient. <em>State v. Parker, </em>124 <em>N.J. </em>628, 633-35, 592 A.2d 228 (1991), <em>cert. denied, </em>503 <em>U.S. </em>939,112 <em>S.Ct. </em>1483, 117 L.Ed.2d 625 (1992).</p>\n<blockquote id=\"b310-7\">In some circumstances, however, a general charge on jury unanimity will not suffice. That is so when, for example, \u201ca single crime can be proven by different theories based on different acts and at least two of these theories rely on different evidence, and [when] the circumstances demonstrate a reasonable possibility that a juror will find one theory proven and the other not proven but that all of the jurors will not agree on the same theory.\u201d <em>People v. Melendez, </em>224 <em>Cal.App</em>.3d 1420, 1433-34, 274 <em>Cal.Rptr. </em>599, 608 (1990).</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b310-8\"><em>[Id. </em>at 635, 592 A.2d 228.]</blockquote>\n<p id=\"b310-9\">Because there is no basis here to conclude that a genuine possibility of jury confusion occurred or that different jurors concluded that defendant committed distinct acts, we conclude that the general unanimity instruction was adequate and no reversible error occurred.</p>\n<p id=\"b310-10\">VII</p>\n<p id=\"b310-11\">Finally, we address defendant\u2019s sentence. Because we reverse defendant\u2019s murder conviction, the sentence of life with a sixty-three and three-quarter-year parole bar cannot stand. Defendant argues, however, that NERA does not apply to his murder conviction and cites our opinion in <em>State v. Manzie, </em>335 <em>N.J.Super. </em>267, 762 A.2d 276 (App.Div.2000), <em>aff'd, </em>168 <em>N.J. </em>113, 773 A.2d 659 (2001).</p>\n<p id=\"b311-4\"><page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"277\">*277</page-number>Our Supreme Court affirmed in a per curiam opinion because the members of the Court were equally divided. The result is that the Supreme Court\u2019s decision is binding in <em>Manzie </em>only, as it is essentially the law of that case. <em>See Abbamont v. Piscataway Township Bd. of Educ., </em>314 <em>N.J.Super. </em>293, 300-01, 714 A.2d 958 (App.Div.1998), <em>aff'd, </em>163 <em>N.J. </em>14, 746 A.2d 997 (1999). The State thus urges that if we affirm defendant\u2019s murder conviction, we should disagree with our earlier decision in <em>Manzie </em>and hold that NERA applies to defendant\u2019s murder conviction.</p>\n<p id=\"b311-5\">Because of our reversal and remand, we only address this issue in the event, on retrial, defendant is convicted of murder. If he is convicted of murder, the trial judge shall follow the holding in <em>Manzie, </em>and not apply NERA to the conviction.</p>\n<p id=\"b311-6\">We also vacate the sentences imposed on defendant\u2019s four convictions for unlawful use of a credit card. Defendant was sentenced as if these are fourth degree convictions. They are third degree convictions. <em>See N.J.S.A. </em>2C:21-6h. Accordingly, the sentences imposed are illegal.</p>\n<p id=\"b311-7\">VIII</p>\n<p id=\"b311-8\">We reverse defendant\u2019s murder conviction and remand for a new trial. We reverse the sentences imposed on defendant\u2019s four convictions for unlawful use of a credit card and remand for resentencing. In all other respects, we affirm.</p>\n<footnote label=\"1\">\n<p id=\"b297-15\"> <em>Miranda v.
