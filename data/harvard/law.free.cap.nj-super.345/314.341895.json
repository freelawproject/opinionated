The judge denied defendant\u2019s motion for judgment notwithstanding the verdict or for a new trial.</p>\n<p id=\"b352-6\">Defendant\u2019s appeal raises an issue of first impression with respect to a consumer\u2019s right to seek a Lemon Law remedy in the Superior Court. The present statute, enacted in 1988, repealed and replaced the prior Lemon Law statute, <em>N.J.S.A. </em>56:12-19 to - 28, and provided for the first time for an administrative hearing procedure within the Division of Consumer Affairs. The novel issue before us arises out of an administrative regulation, <em>N.J.A.C. </em>13:45A-26.5, which purports to require a consumer both to send the manufacturer a so-called \u201clast chance\u201d letter, and to establish that the claimed defect \u201ccontinues to exist,\u201d as prerequisites to pursuing not only an administrative claim, as expressly required by the statute, but also as prerequisites to maintaining a Superior Court action under the Lemon Law. There is no dispute that plaintiffs did not send the last chance letter and that the defects were repaired one week before the complaint was filed. If the regulation as written governs Lemon Law claims brought in Superior Court, plaintiffs\u2019 claim fails as a matter of law, and we must revers\u00e9;</p>\n<p id=\"b352-7\">The statute itself expressly requires the consumer to meet the disputed requirements only in two circumstances: when a consumer seeks the statutory remedy in a summary administrative proceeding in the Division of Consumer Affairs (the Division) pursuant to <em>N.J.S.A. </em>56:12-37, or when a consumer who seeks relief in any one of the three dispute resolution forums recognized by the statute invokes an evidentiary presumption established by <em>N.J.S.A. </em>56:12-33. But <em>N.JAC. </em>13:45A-26.5 requires the consumer to meet both prerequisites in order \u201c[t]o initiate a claim <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"319\">*319</page-number>under the Lemon Law,\u201d including a claim filed in the Superior Court.</p>\n<p id=\"b353-6\">The question posed is whether the regulation falls within the scope of the authority delegated to the Division by the statute, or whether it is inconsistent with the statute and therefore outside the scope of its authority. We conclude that the regulation on its face is inconsistent with the statute insofar as it establishes prerequisites to filing a Lemon Law claim in the Superior Court. Accordingly, neither plaintiffs\u2019 failure to send defendant a \u201clast chance\u201d letter nor the fact that the nonconformities were eventually repaired bars this claim.</p>\n<p id=\"b353-7\">We also reject defendant\u2019s arguments with respect to several evidentiary rulings, the jury charge, and the weight of the evidence. We therefore affirm.</p>\n<p id=\"b353-8\">On May 3, 1997, plaintiffs Nancy and Michael DiVigenze<footnotemark>2</footnotemark> entered into a lease agreement with an authorized Chrysler dealer for a new 1997 Jeep Grand Cherokee.<footnotemark>3</footnotemark> Several warranty repairs were performed between May 1997 and February 1998 and are not the basis for plaintiffs Lemon Law claim.</p>\n<p id=\"b353-9\">Plaintiff testified that she first experienced severe shaking of the entire vehicle and almost lost control of the vehicle on the highway on January 3,1998, while driving her mother to a doctor\u2019s appointment. After pulling off the road, turning off the engine, and then restarting it, plaintiff was able to continue her trip. She drove the vehicle to the dealer the same day, but the dealer\u2019s mechanic was unable to reproduce the condition in a test-drive, and there is no written record of that service visit. Plaintiffs <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"320\">*320</page-number>mother testified and corroborated plaintiffs version of the incident.</p>\n<p id=\"b354-5\">On February' 27, 1998, when the vehicle had traveled 14,723 miles, plaintiff again experienced severe shaking and vibration of the vehicle which impaired her control. Plaintiff brought the vehicle to the dealer and also reported an inoperable brake light. The dealer diagnosed a loose steering box and a chafed brake light wire.</p>\n<p id=\"b354-6\">The severe vibration occurred again. This time, the vehicle began to shake badly while plaintiff was negotiating a curve in the road. The brake light also failed again, and both conditions led plaintiff to return to the dealer on March 27, 1998. The dealer again replaced the steering box and ordered a new module for the brake light. The severe vibration in the car occurred again the same day.</p>\n<p id=\"b354-7\">Plaintiff returned to the dealer with the same two complaints on April 14. The dealer installed a new brake light module, but claimed to be unable to reproduce the vibration while test-driving the vehicle. Both conditions occurred again, and plaintiff returned to the dealer on May 21,1998. This time the dealer found a leak in the steering damper and a short in the brake light wiring. Both defective parts were replaced. Plaintiff testified that the vibration condition then improved substantially, from a \u201cten\u201d on a scale of one to ten to a \u201cone or two,\u201d although there were still intermittent incidents of vibration in the steering wheel. After the May 21 repairs, the vehicle itself no longer vibrated severely so as to threaten loss of control, and the brake light functioned properly.</p>\n<p id=\"b354-8\">This complaint against Chrysler Corporation <footnotemark>4</footnotemark> was filed on May 28, 1998, alleging substantial defects and nonconformities in the vehicle. The complaint included counts under the New Jersey Automobile Lemon Law, <em>N.J.S.A. </em>56:12-29 to -49, the Magnuson <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"321\">*321</page-number>Moss Warranty Act, 15 <em>U.S.C.A. </em>\u00a7\u00a7 2301-2312, the New Jersey Consumer Fraud Act, <em>N.J.S.A. </em>56:8-1 to -91, express warranties under the contract between the parties, and implied warranties of fitness and merchantability under the Uniform Commercial Code, <em>N.J.S.A. </em>12A:2-313, -314, and -315.</p>\n<p id=\"b355-6\">At trial, plaintiff withdrew her consumer fraud claim and the court granted defendant\u2019s motion for judgment on plaintiffs implied warranty claims. The trial judge rejected defendant\u2019s arguments that plaintiffs failure to send a last chance letter and the fact that the defects were eventually repaired barred her Lemon Law claim. The judge denied defendant\u2019s motion for judgment dismissing plaintiffs Lemon Law and express warranty claims. Both parties agreed that if the jury found liability under the Lemon Law, the jury would be instructed not to consider the express warranty claim.<footnotemark>5</footnotemark> The judge also denied defendant\u2019s request to inform the jury of the amount that would be awarded in the event the jury found liability under the Lemon Law; however, the jury was informed that recovery under the Lemon Law would entitle plaintiff to return the vehicle, in which case the court would calculate the damage award to which plaintiff was entitled.</p>\n<p id=\"b355-7\">The judge accurately summarized the parties\u2019 contentions respecting the Lemon Law claim, telling the jury that it was plaintiffs contention that Chrysler failed to correct, within a reasonable time, defects which \u201csubstantially impair[ed] the vehicle\u2019s use, value or safety\u201d; that such defects would constitute a nonconformity under the Lemon Law; and that defendant \u201casserts that any alleged problems with the vehicle have been corrected by it within a reasonable period of time. Additionally, that any alleged nonconformity does not substantially impair the use, value or safety of the vehicle.\u201d</p>\n<p id=\"b355-8\">In answer to four questions on the verdict sheet respecting plaintiffs Lemon Law claim, the jury determined that \u201cplaintiffs <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"322\">*322</page-number>vehicle had a nonconformity or nonconformities\u201d that were \u201cfirst reported to Chrysler ... within the plaintiffs first twenty-four months or 18,000 miles of use,\u201d that Chrysler \u201cfailed to repair ... within a reasonable period of time,\u201d and that the vehicle\u2019s milage was 14,723 when first presented \u201cfor corrections of a nonconformity.\u201d</p>\n<p id=\"b356-5\">The judge calculated the statutory refund based upon plaintiffs total lease payments and related fees of $42,024.38, less a mileage offset of $5,296.01, and entered judgment for $36,728.37.<footnotemark>6</footnotemark> Plaintiff was also awarded $8,751 in attorneys\u2019 fees and costs. Defendant moved for judgment notwithstanding the verdict or a new trial, arguing that plaintiffs Lemon Law claim failed because the defects had been repaired, and that plaintiffs failure to send a last chance letter barred her claim. The judge rejected those arguments, as well as defendant\u2019s arguments that the jury instructions were erroneous, that defendant\u2019s expert witness\u2019s testimony was unfairly limited, and that the verdict was against the weight of the evidence, and accordingly denied defendant\u2019s motions.</p>\n<p id=\"b356-6\">I.</p>\n<p id=\"b356-7\">In order to address the legal issues raised by defendant\u2019s reliance on the regulation, we begin by examining and comparing the Lemon Law statute with the regulation in issue, <em>N.J.A.C. </em>45:13-26.5.</p>\n<p id=\"b356-8\"><em>N.J.S.A. </em>56:12-29 sets forth the legislative findings that precipitated enactment of the Lemon Law, along with three expressed goals of the law:</p>\n<blockquote id=\"b356-9\">The Legislature finds that the purchase of a new motor vehicle is a major, high cost consumer transaction and the inability to correct defects in these vehicles <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"323\">*323</page-number>creates a major hardship and an unacceptable economic burden on the consumer. It is the intent of this act to require the manufacturer of a new motor vehicle to correct defects originally covered under the manufacturer\u2019s warranty which are identified and reported within a specified period. It is the further intent of this act to provide procedures to expeditiously resolve disputes between a consumer and a manufacturer when defects in a new motor vehicle are not corrected within a reasonable time, and to provide to award [sic] specific remedies where the uncorrected defect substantially impairs the use, value, or safety of the new motor vehicle.</blockquote>\n<p id=\"b357-6\">The three-fold statutory intent is to require the manufacturer to make warranted repairs within a specific time frame, to establish expeditious dispute resolution procedures, and to provide remedies for the failure to repair substantial defects. To carry out those intentions, the statute imposes an affirmative obligation upon the manufacturer of a vehicle to repair substantial defects within a reasonable time:</p>\n<blockquote id=\"b357-7\">If a consumer reports a nonconformity in a motor vehicle to the manufacturer or its dealer during the first 18,000 miles of operation or during the period of two years following the date of original delivery to a consumer, whichever is earlier, <em>the manufacturer shall make, or arrange urith its dealer to make, within a reasonable time, all repairs necessary to correct the nonconformity.</em></blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b357-8\"><em>[N.J.S.A. </em>56:12-31 (emphasis added).]</blockquote>\n<p id=\"b357-9\">A \u201cnonconformity\u201d is defined in the Lemon Law as \u201ca defect or condition which substantially impairs the use, value or safety of a motor vehicle.\u201d <em>N.J.S.A. </em>56:12-30.</p>\n<p id=\"b357-10\">If the manufacturer is \u201cunable to repair or correct a nonconformity within a reasonable time,\u201d the manufacturer is obligated to \u201cprovide the consumer with a full refund of the purchase price ... including any [trade-in allowance and related costs and fees] less a reasonable allowance for vehicle use.\u201d <em>N.J.S.A. </em>56:12-32a. Alternatively, the manufacturer may \u201coffer to replace the vehicle in lieu of a refund\u201d but the consumer may \u201creject a manufacturer\u2019s offer of replacement and demand a refund.\u201d <em>Ibid. </em>Virtually the same remedies apply to a consumer who leases a new motor vehicle: refund of all payments and cancellation of the lease, less an allowance for reasonable use. <em>N.J.S.A. </em>56:12-32b.<footnotemark>7</footnotemark></p>\n<p id=\"b358-4\"><page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"324\">*324</page-number>The statute includes a rebuttable presumption that is available to a consumer under certain circumstances. \u201cIt is presumed that a manufacturer ... is unable to repair or correct a nonconformity within a reasonable time\u201d if the nonconformity \u201ccontinues to exist\u201d after three repair attempts or after the vehicle is out of service for a cumulative total of twenty days. <em>N.J.S.A. </em>56:12-33a. In other words, a consumer can meet her burden of producing evidence of the manufacturer\u2019s inability to repair within a reasonable time by producing evidence that the nonconformity \u201ccontinues to exist\u201d after the specified number of repairs or time out of service. But the presumption can apply against a manufacturer only if the plaintiff has given the manufacturer written notice of the consumer\u2019s Lemon Law claim by certified mail and has advised the manufacturer in that notice that it has one final opportunity to repair the defect within ten days. <em>N.J.S.A. </em>56:12-33b. That written notice is known as the \u201clast chance\u201d letter.</p>\n<p id=\"b358-5\">The present Lemon Law statute recognizes three forums to \u201ceffectively resolve disputes between a consumer and a manufacturer when defects in a motor vehicle are not corrected within a reasonable time.\u201d Those forums are: (1) an informal dispute resolution procedure established by the manufacturer, <em>N.J.S.A. </em>56:12-36; (2) a summary dispute resolution procedure established within the Division, <em>N.J.S.A. </em>56:12-37, in what is now known as the Lemon Law Unit, <em>N.J.A.C. </em>13:45A-26.4; and (3) a Superior Court action. <em>N.J.S.A. </em>56:12-39. By providing an expeditious administrative forum in the Division to resolve consumer complaints under the Lemon Law, this statute effected a significant change from prior law.<footnotemark>8</footnotemark> The statute does not elaborate further on the substance or procedure applicable to a Superior Court action under the Lemon Law.</p>\n<p id=\"b359-5\"><page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"325\">*325</page-number>In creating an administrative forum for the first time, \u00a7 37 required the Division to provide for an expedited hearing on Lemon Law claims in the Office of Administrative Law and delegated authority to the Director of the Division to enact rules for handling such claims. One such enactment in 1988 was <em>N.J.AC. </em>13:45-26.5, which applies the \u00a7 33 last chance letter requirement to every consumer. In 1993, the Legislature amended \u00a7 37 to require any consumer seeking relief in the Division\u2019s Lemon Law Unit to send a last chance letter to the manufacturer as \u201ca prerequisite to the filing of an application [in the Division].\u201d <em>N.J.S.A. </em>56:12-37a. There has been no similar amendment to <em>N.J.S.A. </em>56:12-39, the statute\u2019s brief reference to a Superior Court action, or to <em>N.J.S.A. </em>56:12-36, the statute\u2019s detailed prescription for a manufacturer\u2019s informal dispute resolution system. Thus under the statute, a last chance letter is required of a consumer only under two circumstances: when filing a Lemon Law claim in the Division, or when invoking the statutory presumption in any forum.</p>\n<p id=\"b359-6\">Under the regulation, <em>N.J.AC. </em>13:45A-26.5, the last chance letter is a prerequisite to every consumer\u2019s Lemon Law claim, wherever filed, and irrespective of the consumer\u2019s reliance upon the \u00a7 33 presumption. <em>N.J.A.C. </em>13:45A-26.5 provides:</p>\n<blockquote id=\"b359-7\">(a) To initiate a claim under the Lemon Law, written notification of the potential claim must be sent certified mail, return receipt requested, by or on behalf of a consumer, to the manufacturer of a nonconforming motor vehicle if either of the following occurs during the first 18,000 miles of operation or within 24 months after the date of original delivery, whichever is earlier:</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b359-8\">1. Substantially the same nonconformity has been subject to repair two or more times by the manufacturer or its dealer and the nonconformity continues to exist; or</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b359-9\">2. The motor vehicle has been out of service by reason of repair for one or more nonconformities for a cumulative total of 20 or more days since the original delivery of the motor vehicle, and a nonconformity continues to exist.</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b359-10\">(b) The manufacturer by law has one more opportunity to repair or correct the nonconformity within 10 days following receipt of notification from the consumer of a potential claim; if the nonconformity continues to exist after expiration of the 10 day time period and the manufacturer refuses to replace or refund the price of the vehicle, the criteria necessary to pursue a Lemon Law claim have been met. The consumer may then:</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b360-3\"><page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"326\">*326</page-number>1. Refer the matter to the manufacturer for resolution through the manufacturer\u2019s informal dispute settlement procedure;</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b360-4\">2. Refer the matter to the LLU for dispute resolution; or</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b360-5\">3. File an action in the Superior Court____</blockquote>\n<p id=\"b360-6\">In other words, the consumer may not seek relief in any of those three forums if she has not complied with sections (a) and (b) of the regulation \u2014 the same requirements for invoking the \u00a7 33 presumption.</p>\n<p id=\"b360-7\">The question posed by comparing <em>N.J.A.C. </em>13:45A-26.5 with the Lemon Law statute is whether the regulation, by enacting these prerequisites to filing a claim in the Superior Court, exceeds the delegation of authority conferred by <em>N.J.S.A. </em>56:12-37b and 56:12-49. In determining whether the regulation is within the statute\u2019s delegation of authority to the Division, it is appropriate to compare the consequences imposed by the statute with those imposed by the regulation when a consumer fails to satisfy the prerequisites for invoking the \u00a7 33 presumption.</p>\n<p id=\"b360-8\">Under \u00a7 33 of the statute, the consequences of a plaintiffs failure to send a last chance letter, or to prove that a defect continues to exist, are limited. That consumer cannot take advantage of the presumption. When the Legislature amended \u00a7 37 to incorporate the \u00a7 33 prerequisites, it extended the consequences of those failures, but only to bar the consumer\u2019s access to the Division\u2019s administrative forum, the Lemon Law Unit. The Legislature never extended those consequences to bar a consumer\u2019s access to the courts or to the manufacturer\u2019s dispute resolution system. The regulation alone did so, effectively turning the \u00a7 33 prerequisites for invoking a presumption into elements of the Lemon Law cause of action.</p>\n<p id=\"b360-9\">We are fully cognizant of the presumption of validity accorded to an administrative agency\u2019s duly enacted regulations. \u201cA strong presumption of reasonableness accompanies an administrative agency\u2019s exercise of statutorily delegated responsibility.\u201d <em>Gloucester County Welfare Bd. v.

City of Hoboken Rent Leveling &amp; Stabilization Bd., </em>332 <em>N.J.Super. </em>547, 551-52, 753 A.2d 1231 (App.Div.2000).</p>\n<p id=\"b362-5\">The expressed, general intent of the Lemon Law is to protect the new car consumer. <em>See N.J.S.A. </em>56:12-29; <em>Berrie v. Toyota Motor Sales, USA, Inc., </em>267 <em>N.J.Super. </em>152, 155-56, 630 A.2d 1180 (App.Div.1993); <em>Singer v. Land Rover N. Am., Inc., </em>955 <em>F.Supp. </em>359, 363 (D.N.J.1997). In enacting the new Lemon Law in 1988, creating an administrative forum for a Lemon Law complaint, the Legislature exhibited its specific intent to create a summary procedure in the Division and expressly delegated to the Division the authority to enact rules for that procedure.</p>\n<p id=\"A28\">Both the general and the specific intent of the statute are evident in the relationship between the \u00a7 33 presumption and the \u00a7 37 administrative dispute resolution system. Both protect the interest of the consumer. Section 33 eases the burden of establishing a <em>prima facie </em>case, and \u00a7 37 creates a summary procedure for obtaining the statutory remedy. As amended to require use of the presumption in the administrative forum, \u00a7 37 reduces the burden on the dispute resolution system by limiting the proofs and narrowing the issues to be determined. When the Legislature amended \u00a7 37, it implicitly recognized the Division\u2019s authority to require the \u00a7 33 prerequisites for every claim brought in the Division. The Legislature gave no such recognition to the Division\u2019s extension of those prerequisites to a Superior Court action, an area outside the Division\u2019s expertise. <em>Compare In re Amendment of N.J.A.C. 8:31B-3.31, </em>119 <em>N.J. </em>531, 543, 575 A.2d 481 (1990) (\u201c[Recognition that certain subjects are within the peculiar competence of [an] agency\u201d can warrant a finding of implied authority) (citing <em>Bergen Pines Hosp. v. Dep\u2019t of Human Servs., </em>96 <em>N.J. </em>456, 474, 476 A.2d 784 (1984)).</p>\n<p id=\"b362-8\">Defendant relies on the regulation to support its contention that plaintiff is barred from recovery under the Lemon Law not only for failing to send a last chance letter, but also because the nonconformities were repaired before she filed her Superior Court complaint. A rule that would bar recovery in Superior Court once <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"329\">*329</page-number>the vehicle has been repaired would make court action impractical for many consumers. Such a rule would mean that a consumer who could not get satisfactory repair from the manufacturer within a reasonable time would be forced to stop all attempts at repair and to maintain a potentially unsafe or less than useful vehicle in that condition in order to preserve the right to bring a Lemon Law claim to trial. We deem it highly unlikely that the Legislature would have provided the lawsuit alternative if it intended to make the administrative hearing route the only practical one for every consumer.</p>\n<p id=\"b363-6\">We see no evidence that the Legislature intended to add a potential bar to suit in the Superior Court when it expressly amended the statute to add that same bar only for an administrative proceeding.<footnotemark>9</footnotemark> If the Legislature intended the regulation to govern all Lemon Law claims, including those brought in Superior Court, the 1993 amendment either was unnecessary, or logically should have included amendments to \u00a7 36 and \u00a7 39, governing manufacturer\u2019s dispute resolution and Superior Court actions, respectively. We find no evidence that the Legislature intended to delegate to the Division authority to change the law itself, and we conclude that those portions of the regulation that would bar a Superior Court action are inconsistent with the statute.</p>\n<p id=\"b363-7\">This conclusion is reinforced by the legislative history. When the present Lemon Law was enacted in 1988, the Senate Labor, Industry and Professions Committee expressed its intention that the Division enact \u201crules and procedures to provide the consumer with an effective, informal and expeditious alternative for resolving disputes....\u201d Statement to S. No. 2201. After the Division enacted <em>N.J.AC. </em>13:45A-26.5, the Legislature amended <em>N.J.S.A. </em>56:12-37 to add the \u00a7 33 last chance letter requirement as a <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"330\">*330</page-number>precondition to pursuing relief in the Division. S. No. 608, L.1993, c. 21, \u00a7 4. The Statement of the Senate Law and Public Safety Committee to Senate No. 608 evidences the Legislature\u2019s intention to see that every Lemon Law case brought in the Division\u2019s Lemon Law Unit is a presumption case:</p>\n<blockquote id=\"b364-5\">A final letter from the consumer to the manufacturer will be required as a precondition to initiating the Lemon Law process. <em>The division has ruled that the letter of final notice and opportunity to repair written by the consumer to the manufacturer is necessary prior to the Lemon Law unit accepting an application for review.</em><footnotemark><em>10</em></footnotemark><em> </em>The division therefore requires the consumer to state in the application to the unit that he has given the manufacturer a final opportunity to repair and that the problem still exists. <em>This step ensures that the statutory presumption in [N.J.S. </em>A <em>56:12-33] that the vehicle is a lemon is applicable in all Lemon Law cases handled by the division.</em></blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b364-6\">[Emphasis added.]</blockquote>\n<p id=\"b364-7\">Our conclusion is further supported by the Division\u2019s present position. The Attorney General argues on behalf of the Division that the last chance letter and the continued existence of the defect are required only for a consumer who proceeds in the Division\u2019s Lemon Law Unit or who invokes the presumption in a court action. Although contrary to the literal terms of the regulation, the Division now expressly disavows an intention to impose those requirements upon a consumer\u2019s Lemon Law suit.</p>\n<p id=\"b364-8\">We give substantial, though not controlling deference to an agency\u2019s interpretation of the statute that it is charged with carrying out, as well as to the interpretation the agency itself gives to its own regulation. <em>Muise v. GPU, Inc., swpra, </em>332 <em>N.J.Super. </em>at 158, 753 A.2d 116; <em>see also DiMaria v. Bd. of Trs. of the Pub. Employees\u2019 Ret. Sys., </em>225 <em>N.J.Super. </em>341, 351, 542 A.2d 498 (App.Div.), <em>certif. denied, </em>113 <em>N.J. </em>638, 552 A.2d 164 (1988). We see no reason to disregard the Division\u2019s current position.</p>\n<p id=\"b365-4\"><page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"331\">*331</page-number>Defendant contends that if the regulation is not applied to a Superior Court action, there would be two bodies of law, one for the Lemon Law Unit and one for the Superior Court. We disagree. The substantive elements of the Lemon Law claim remain the same in either forum: a manufacturer\u2019s failure, within a reasonable time, to correct a warranted defect that substantially impairs the vehicle\u2019s use, value, or safety. In either forum the manufacturer has the opportunity to challenge each element of the consumer\u2019s claim.</p>\n<p id=\"b365-5\">II.</p>\n<p id=\"b365-6\">Turning to the evidence at trial, we are persuaded that plaintiff did not rely upon the \u00a7 33 presumption to establish defendant\u2019s failure to repair within a reasonable time. The \u00a7 33b presumption does not shift the burden of proof, and once contrary evidence is produced, the presumption has no further effect. Biunno, <em>Current N.J. Rules of Evidence, </em>comment 3 on <em>N.J.R.E. </em>301 (2001). After plaintiff offered evidence of three unsuccessful repair attempts, defendant relied upon evidence of the fourth, successful repair on May 21, 1998. Defendant then argued that the period from the first vibration and brake light complaints to the May 21 repair was not an unreasonable time. If defendant had cited no evidence of successful repair within an arguably reasonable period, and if plaintiff had relied solely upon the first three unsuccessful attempts to establish defendant\u2019s inability to repair within a reasonable time, the jury would not have been asked, as it was, \u201cDo you find that Chrysler Corp. or its authorized dealer(s) failed to repair the nonconformity or nonconformities within a reasonable period of time?\u201d The evidentiary presumption no longer applied, and it was up to the jury to decide whether the repairs were accomplished within a reasonable time. Since plaintiff did not rely upon the \u00a7 33 presumption, she was not required by that section of the statute to send the last chance letter or to establish that the defects continued to exist.</p>\n<p id=\"b366-4\"><page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"332\">*332</page-number>III.</p>\n<p id=\"b366-5\">Because we find that neither the lack of a last chance letter nor the eventual repairs bar plaintiffs lawsuit, we address defendant\u2019s arguments with respect to alleged errors in the conduct of the trial and in denying defendant\u2019s post-trial motions.</p>\n<p id=\"b366-6\">Defendant argues that the judge should have instructed the jury that if the defect \u201chas been corrected ... then there is no Lemon Law violation,\u201d and that the judge erred in his instruction that:</p>\n<blockquote id=\"b366-7\">[I]n order to qualify for Lemon Law relief the plaintiff need not demonstrate that the vehicle continues to suffer from a nonconformity at the present time, rather the test is whether the defendant corrected any reported nonconformity or noncon-formities within a reasonable period of time.</blockquote>\n<p id=\"b366-8\">That argument essentially repeats defendant\u2019s contention that plaintiffs case is barred because the defects have been repaired. Since we have rejected that contention, we need not repeat our reasons here. The essence of plaintiffs case is whether the repairs were completed within a reasonable time, and the jury answered that question in the negative.</p>\n<p id=\"b366-9\">We also reject defendant\u2019s contention that the judge failed to explain or guide the jury respecting the nature of the \u201csubstantial impairment\u201d that plaintiff was required to prove.</p>\n<p id=\"b366-10\">The judge\u2019s charge to the jury was consistent with the Lemon Law:</p>\n<blockquote id=\"b366-11\">[I]n order to establish a claim under the New Jersey Lemon Law the plaintiffs must establish by a preponderance or greater weight of the behevable evidence that, (A) the plaintiff\u2019s vehicle had a nonconformity, (B) that such nonconformity or nonconformities were first reported to a dealer within the first two years or 18,000 miles of use after the date in which the plaintiff first took delivery of the vehicle whichever period is shorter, and, (C) that Daimler Chrysler or its authorized dealers did not make within a reasonable time ah repairs necessary to correct the nonconformity or nonconformities.</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b366-12\">What then is the definition of a nonconformity under the New Jersey Lemon Law Act? A nonconformity is defined as any defect or condition which substantially impairs the use, value or safety of the vehicle.</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"Aoq\"><page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"333\">*333</page-number>To substantially impair the defect or condition must impair the use, value or safety in an important, essential or significant way. It cannot be a minor, trivial or unimportant way.</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b367-5\">The intent of the law is to require manufacturers to correct detects originally covered under manufacturers\u2019 warranties.</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b367-6\">Now, in determining if a defect or condition substantially impairs the use or value of the automobile you can consider whether the defects or conditions have shaken the plaintiff\u2019s confidence in the automobile. If the plaintiffs confidence in the vehicle has been shaken this loss of confidence can be the basis for a finding that the vehicle\u2019s use or value has been substantially \u2014 has been substantially impaired.</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"Aqc\">But in making this determination I charge you that the standard is subjective or personal <em>in </em>the sense that the facts must be examined in the view point of the buyer and her circumstances but they are also objective in the sense that the criteria is what a reasonable person in the buyer\u2019s position would have believed.</blockquote>\n<p id=\"b367-7\">The mixed subjective/objective test, which allows the factfinder to consider a consumer\u2019s reasonably shaken confidence in the vehicle as a factor in determining substantial impairment, is a correct statement of the law. <em>See Berrie v. Toyota, supra, </em>267 <em>N.J.Super. </em>at 157, 630 A.2d 1180.</p>\n<p id=\"b367-8\">While the judge refused defendant\u2019s request to tell the jury exactly how much plaintiff would recover, the judge effectively informed the jury of the extent of the remedy:</p>\n<blockquote id=\"b367-9\">If the manufacturer or dealer is unable to correct a nonconformity within a reasonable time, the manufacturer shall accept return of the motor vehicle from the consumer.</blockquote>\n<p id=\"b367-10\">And defense counsel argued without objection in his summation that plaintiff was asking the jury \u201cto basically give her all her money back.\u201d The judge\u2019s instruction served essentially the purpose the defense argued for. It supplied the jury with an order of magnitude of the potential award in order to give sufficient content to an essential element of the cause of action: that the defect \u201csubstantially impairs\u201d the value, use, or safety of the vehicle. We do not suggest that it would have been error to grant defendant\u2019s request, but only that under the circumstances it was not reversible error to deny the charge as requested. <em>Compare Wanetick v. Gateway Mitsubishi </em>163 <em>N.J. </em>484, 750 A.2d 79 (2000) (ultimate outcome charge should generally be given in consumer fraud cases).</p>\n<p id=\"b368-3\"><page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"334\">*334</page-number>We also reject defendant\u2019s argument that the verdict was against the weight of the evidence. In support of its argument that it was error to deny its motion for a new trial, defendant contends that since plaintiff testified that the vibration was first reported in January, but the jury found that any nonconformity was first reported at 14,723 miles (the mileage in February when the brake light problem was first reported), the jury must have found only the brake light, and not the vibration, to be the substantial defect under the Lemon Law. Defendant argues, based on one reported case in the Division, that a brake light cannot, as a matter of law, constitute a Lemon Law nonconformity. Assuming (without deciding) that a defective brake light alone would not support a Lemon Law claim, we reject defendant\u2019s assertion that the jury verdict cannot stand.<footnotemark>11</footnotemark></p>\n<p id=\"b368-4\">There was sufficient credible evidence that \u201creasonable minds might accept ... as adequate to support\u201d the jury\u2019s conclusion that a nonconformity remained after attempted repairs in February, March, and April, and that the unrepaired defects continued for an unreasonable period of time. <em>See Dolson v. Anastasia, </em>55 <em>N.J. </em>2, 6, 258 A.2d 706 (1969). The jury apparently believed plaintiff\u2019s testimony concerning the repeated, unrepaired problems with the vehicle. <em>See Christelles v. Nissan Motor Corp., </em>305 <em>N.J.Super. </em>222, 701 A.2d 1317 (App.Div.1997) (expert testimony is not required). There is no dispute that the vehicle\u2019s spontaneous and excessive vibration was diagnosed on May 21 as a defective steering damper and repaired on that date, along with the malfunctioning brake light. Moreover, the testimony of defendant\u2019s expert automobile mechanic, Henry Gill, could be understood to support plaintiff\u2019s testimony that the vibration and loss of steering control that she experienced in February, March, April, and May <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"335\">*335</page-number>(and perhaps in January as well) were caused by the defective damper problem that was diagnosed on May 21, 1998, and constituted a substantial impairment under the Lemon Law.</p>\n<p id=\"b369-6\">As plaintiffs attorney asked the jury rhetorically in his closing argument, \u201cIf you have a car that you cannot control on the road, is it reasonable to take from January 3rd to May to repair it, May 21st, is that reasonable? ... Is that reasonable to drive a vehicle from February until May without brake lights?\u201d The jury was instructed to consider whether the manufacturer, through its authorized dealer, was unable to accomplish the repairs for an unreasonable period. The jury had to decide whether the defective conditions of the vehicle, namely the intermittent, severe vibration that affected control of the car, along with the malfunctioning brake light, continued for an unreasonable period of time without the manufacturer being able to repair, and if so whether those defects substantially impaired the value, use, or safety of the vehicle. The jury answered \u201cyes\u201d to both questions, and we are satisfied that there was sufficient credible evidence to support the jury\u2019s answers.</p>\n<p id=\"b369-7\">A trial court\u2019s ruling on a motion for a new trial alleging a jury verdict to be against the weight of the evidence \u201cshall not be reversed unless it clearly appears that there was a miscarriage of justice under the law.\u201d <em>R. </em>2:10-1; <em>Dolson v. Anastasia, supra, </em>55 <em>N.J. </em>at 7-9, 258 A.2d 706. We are satisfied that there was no error of law that unfairly prejudiced the jury\u2019s verdict and no miscarriage of justice.</p>\n<p id=\"b369-8\">We find no merit in defendant\u2019s remaining arguments respecting plaintiffs testimony or the alleged limitations placed upon defendant\u2019s expert\u2019s testimony, none of which warrant discussion in this opinion. <em>See R. </em>2:ll-3(e)(l)(E).</p>\n<p id=\"b369-9\">We affirm.</p>\n<footnote label=\"2\">\n<p id=\"b353-10\"> Although both Nancy and Michael DiVigenze were named as lessees under the lease agreement, only Nancy DiVigenze testified at the trial.

Whereas consumer participation in such qualified procedures was a prerequisite to any remedy under the former law, <em>NJ.S.A. </em>56:12-25 (repealed), it is not required under the present law. <em>N.J.S.A. </em>56:12-39.</p>\n</footnote>\n<footnote label=\"9\">\n<p id=\"b363-8\"> While we find no bar to plaintiff's suit, we nevertheless assume that in most cases, as a matter of sound practice, it will behoove a consumer contemplating a potential Lemon Law claim to send the last chance letter and to allow the manufacturer a final opportunity to repair any nonconformity within ten days of receipt of that letter.</p>\n</footnote>\n<footnote label=\"10\">\n<p id=\"b364-9\"> Defendant's reliance upon those rulings is misplaced. By definition the Division's decisions arise solely out of cases brought in the Lemon Law Unit, and hold only that the regulation applies to proceedings in the Division. Those decisions have no precedential value on the issue before us: whether the letter is also required before going to court.</p>\n</footnote>\n<footnote label=\"11\">\n<p id=\"b368-5\"> We cannot know why the jury found that the nonconformity was first reported at 14,723 miles. Perhaps because there was no January repair record, or because the January mileage was not in evidence. Or the jury may have concluded that the combined defects, which required plaintiff to brake or pull over without a brake light to warn following drivers, together constituted the nonconformity.</p>\n</footnote>\n</opinion>\n</casebody>\n",
