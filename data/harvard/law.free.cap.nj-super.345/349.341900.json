Accordingly, we remand to the judge designated by the Supreme Court to consider applications regarding discovery in \u201cracial profiling\u201d cases involving the New Jersey State Police, to consider the defendant\u2019s request for discovery to support his claim.</p>\n<p id=\"b385-8\">I.</p>\n<p id=\"b385-9\">Following denial of his motion to suppress, defendant was convicted of possession of a controlled dangerous substance, contrary to <em>N.J.S.A. </em>2C:35-10a(l) (count one) and possession of a controlled dangerous substance with intent to distribute, contrary to <em>N.J.S.A. </em>2C:35-5a(l) and -5b(l). The motion challenged the \u201cconsent\u201d search.</p>\n<p id=\"b385-10\">At sentencing, on December 20, 1996, count one was merged into count two and defendant was sentenced to the custody of the Commissioner of Corrections for twenty years with six years and eight months to be served before parole eligibility. Judgment was entered that day or shortly thereafter. <em>R. </em>3:1-4; <em>R. </em>3:21-5.</p>\n<p id=\"b385-11\">Defendant appealed from the judgment, and we affirmed the conviction. However, we remanded for resentencing, resulting in an eighteen-year sentence with a six-year parole ineligibility term.</p>\n<p id=\"b385-12\">A petition for post-conviction relief was filed on November 10, 1997, less than five years after the conviction. <em>See R. </em>3:22-12. It alleged (1) ineffectiveness of trial counsel for \u201crefusing] to investigate\u201d the case; (2) prosecutorial misconduct, and (3) that an <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"352\">*352</page-number>excessive sentence was imposed.<footnotemark>1</footnotemark> Other contentions, including a claim of \u201cracial profiling\u201d and a challenge to the stop, were also raised at the PCR hearing.</p>\n<p id=\"b386-5\">The PCR judge denied the petition on January 6, 2000,<footnotemark>2</footnotemark> stating in part:</p>\n<blockquote id=\"b386-6\">With regard to the racial profiling issue, I\u2019m going to deny that also without prejudice because I think that all these issues are going to take place in front of one judge. It just makes sense and there\u2019s nothing again here that would satisfy the second prong of Strickland.</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b386-7\">Furthermore, even if the State of New Jersey now admits that racial profiling was going on at this time, I mean at the time of the report there is a record. I don\u2019t know whether that type of decision would be retroactive. I have to take some type of guidance from the case law that\u2019s out there and if you look at generally speaking, judicial decisions that are made to curb bad police conduct, those decisions are not normally retroactive if it doesn\u2019t go to the truth seeking process.</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b386-8\">In other words, even though it may have been racial profiling, there\u2019s certainly nothing wrong with the four and a half pounds of cocaine found in the car. It doesn\u2019t go to that. The truth of the matter is that there were four and a half pounds of cocaine in the car.</blockquote>\n<p id=\"b386-9\">II.</p>\n<p id=\"b386-10\">The testimony at the motion to suppress reveals that on October 9, 1995, New Jersey State Police Officer Kevin Goldberg was patrolling the New Jersey Turnpike in Cranbury Township, between Exit 7A and Exit 9. At approximately 4:52 p.m., Goldberg, who was parked along the turnpike operating a \u201cradar unit,\u201d observed \u201ca green Dodge traveling in the center lane at a high rate of speed.\u201d After the radar indicated that the automobile was traveling 69 miles per hour in a 55 mile per hour speed zone, Goldberg left his \u201chiding spot, entered the roadway\u201d and then <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"353\">*353</page-number>\u201cactivate[d his] overhead lights\u201d and \u201cpull[ed the vehicle] over to the side of the road.\u201d</p>\n<p id=\"b387-6\">Upon stopping the car, the trooper approached the passenger side of the vehicle and observed three occupants. Defendant was driving the automobile, Jeanetta White was the front seat passenger and her husband, Sean White, was seated in the right rear.</p>\n<p id=\"b387-7\">Goldberg initiated conversation with defendant, asking him for \u201cthe documents to the vehicle and his license.\u201d Defendant informed the officer \u201cthat he did not have a driver\u2019s license\u201d but \u201cproduced a photocopy of a ... Pennsylvania registration.\u201d Defendant also advised Trooper Goldberg that the car was a \u201crental vehicle, but that he did not know who had rented the vehicle,\u201d and that \u201che had no identification on him to prove that he was Reginald Clark.\u201d</p>\n<p id=\"b387-8\">Based on his failure to produce the requisite documents, and his \u201cheightened nervous demeanor,\u201d Goldberg asked defendant to exit the car and \u201cstep to the rear of the Dodge.\u201d The trooper then engaged defendant in conversation, at which time defendant explained that he \u201chad the cruise control [set] on 65.\u201d In addition, defendant mentioned that he had driven the Whites from Delaware to a hospital in Brooklyn, New York, in order to visit Mr. White\u2019s mother, who was dying of AIDS.</p>\n<p id=\"b387-9\">Goldberg proceeded to speak with the other occupants of the automobile. First, the officer spoke with Mrs. White, who informed him that she did not know who had rented the car. She did, however, tell Goldberg that they had driven \u201cto New York to visit her mother-in-law ... [who] was dying of AIDS.\u201d On the other hand, her story conflicted with defendant\u2019s in that she stated that they had visited her mother-in-law \u201cat her house,\u201d rather than at a hospital.<footnotemark>3</footnotemark></p>\n<p id=\"b388-4\"><page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"354\">*354</page-number>Next, Trooper Goldberg spoke with Mr. White, who advised that \u201cthey went up to the hospital to visit his mother.\u201d Based on the conflicting stories, the trooper asked \u201cMr. Clark to step back to the troop car,\u201d as he \u201cwanted to search the vehicle.\u201d In addition, a second trooper arrived on the scene and stood with Mr. and Mrs. White \u201cin front of the Dodge.\u201d</p>\n<p id=\"b388-5\">Goldberg then asked defendant to take a seat in the \u201cright rear\u201d seat of the State Police vehicle. At that time, the trooper \u201ccompleted and presented a ... State Police consent to search form.\u201d Goldberg read the form to defendant and informed him that \u201che had the right to refuse the consent.\u201d In addition, Goldberg noted that defendant appeared to be \u201creading along\u201d as the consent form was read to him, and that there were no communication problems between the officer and him.</p>\n<p id=\"b388-6\">Defendant signed the consent form,<footnotemark>4</footnotemark> at which time Goldberg asked him to \u201cgo to the front of the Dodge with Mr. and Mrs. White\u201d and the second trooper. Goldberg then began to search the \u201cpassenger compartment\u201d of the vehicle, and after finding nothing, searched the \u201ctrunk compartment.\u201d In the trunk, the trooper observed \u201c[s]hopping bags and a blue and white knapsack.\u201d</p>\n<p id=\"b388-7\">The shopping bags contained only clothes and shoes. Upon opening the knapsack, Goldberg observed a \u201cbrown paper bag\u201d at the top. The trooper then opened the paper bag and found inside \u201c[a] clear plastic bag containing a large amount of crack cocaine.\u201d The knapsack also contained a \u201cfemale sanitary napkin\u201d and a newspaper. Based on his discovery, Goldberg read the individuals their rights and \u201cthen placed them under arrest.\u201d</p>\n<p id=\"b388-8\">The trial judge deni\u00e9d the motion to suppress because all three passengers said \u201cthey had no luggage in the car\u201d and \u201cno one <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"355\">*355</page-number>claimed ownership of the blue bag.\u201d The judge concluded that, if defendant \u201cis claiming [the bag] is not his, then he has no reasonable expectation of privacy that was invaded ... But if it is Mr. Clark\u2019s blue bag, he gave consent. If it is not, then the person with the right to object would seem to be one of the Whites.\u201d<footnotemark>5</footnotemark></p>\n<p id=\"b389-6\">III.</p>\n<p id=\"b389-7\">A petition for post-conviction relief \u201cis cognizable if based upon ... [a] substantial denial in the conviction proceedings of defendant\u2019s rights under the Constitution of the United States or the Constitution or laws of the State of New Jersey.\u201d <em>R. </em>3:22-2(a). There is no dispute that \u201cracial profiling\u201d violates due process and equal protection rights when a defendant\u2019s car is stopped, and others are not, merely because the driver or passenger is a minority. <em>See United States v. Armstrong, </em>517 <em>U.S. </em>456, 463-66, 116 <em>S.Ct. </em>1480, 1486-87, 134 <em>L.Ed.2d </em>687, 688-89 (1996); <em>State v. Ballard, </em>331 <em>N.J.Super. </em>529, 539-40, 752 A.2d 735 (App. Div.2000); <em>State v. Smith, </em>306 <em>N.J.Super. </em>370, 376-78, 703 A.2d 954 (App.Div.1997). However, <em>R. </em>3:22-4 provides that:</p>\n<blockquote id=\"b389-8\">Any ground for relief not raised in a prior proceeding under this rule, or in the proceedings resulting in the conviction, or in a post-conviction proceeding brought and decided prior to the adoption of this rule, or in any appeal taken in such proceedings is barred from assertion in a proceeding under this rule unless the court on motion or at the hearing finds (a) that the ground for relief not previously asserted could not reasonably have been raised in any prior proceeding; or (b) that enforcement of the bar would result in fundamental injustice; or (c) that denial of relief would be contrary to the Constitution of the United States or the State of New Jersey.</blockquote>\n<p id=\"b389-9\">\u201c[D]efendant has the burden of proving that barring the petition would lead to injustice.\u201d <em>State v. Mitchell, </em>126 <em>N.J. </em>565, 587, 601 A.2d 198 (1992). Here, we deal with a substantive claim cognizable under the state and federal constitutions which defendant raised, although not directly, by virtue of his challenge to the <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"356\">*356</page-number>consent search in the trial court proceedings and on direct appeal. Thus, defendant now suggests that he is not seeking to use the PCR procedure as a substitute for appeal. <em>See R. </em>3:22-3. Rather, he asserts that the proofs needed to support his \u201cprofiling\u201d claim are now available, although they were not at the time of trial and direct appeal.</p>\n<p id=\"b390-5\">Defendant notes that the <em>Interim Report of the State Police Review Team Regarding Allegations of Racial Profiling (\u201cInterim Report </em>\u201d) was not released until April of 1999, over two years following his motion to suppress and conviction. As a result, he argues that he \u201cshould not be prejudiced because the State officials were concealing their unlawful practices.\u201d While the issue of \u201cracial profiling\u201d was not spawned by the release of the \u201cInterim Report,\u201d and had been raised in some cases prior to April of 1999, <em>see State v. Kennedy, </em>247 <em>N.J.Super. </em>21, 588 A.2d 834 (App.Div.1991); <em>State v. Soto, </em>324 <em>N.J.Super. </em>66, 734 A.2d 350 (Law Div.1996) (approved for publication after withdrawal and dismissal of the State\u2019s appeal on April 22, 1999), the <em>Interim Report </em>candidly acknowledged the existence of \u201cracial profiling\u201d which could not be ignored despite the defendant\u2019s previous failure to present evidence sufficient to satisfy the threshold necessary to obtain discovery.<footnotemark>6</footnotemark> <em>State v. Ballard, supra, </em>331 <em>N.J.Super. </em>at 539-48, 752 A.2d 735; <em>State v. Kennedy, supra.</em></p>\n<p id=\"b390-6\">In the <em>Interim Report, </em>the Attorney General\u2019s Review Team concluded, among other things:</p>\n<blockquote id=\"b390-7\">1. Disproportionate Use of the Consent-to-Search Doctrine.</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b390-8\">The data presented to us show that minority motorists were disproportionately subject to consent searches. Information concerning consent searches is particularly instructive in an examination of possible discriminatory practices since, by definition, the decision to request permission to conduct a search is a discretionary one. The only information available to us relates to consent searches that were actually executed, that is, instances where permission to search was granted. No data is available with respect to requests for permission to search that were denied. (The \u201cearly warning system\u201d and recordkeeping protocols recommended in Part V <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"357\">*357</page-number>of this Interim Report would require that this kind of information be documented for future analysis.)</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b391-6\">While the <em>Soto </em>litigation and media attention has focused most intently on the initial decision by state troopers to stop vehicles, as noted throughout this Report, we embrace the notion that police officers may not rely upon inappropriate criteria in making any discretionary decision during the course of a <em>\"Terry\u201d </em>stop, including the decision to ask a motorist to knowingly and voluntarily waive Fourth Amendment rights by consenting to a search.</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b391-7\">We have concluded, based upon our preliminary review of the allegations and information developed in a number of internal affairs investigations, as well as anecdotal accounts from interviews with state troopers, that race and ethnicity may have influenced the exercise of discretion by some officers during the course of some traffic stops.<footnotemark>7</footnotemark></blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b391-8\"><em>[.Interim Report </em>at 28.1</blockquote>\n<p id=\"b391-9\">As a result, the <em>Interim Report </em>provides that a request to conduct a consent search by the State Police may be authorized \u201conly when facts are present that constitute a reasonable, articulable suspicion that the search would reveal evidence of a crime,\u201d <em>id. </em>at 85, and a consent decree entered in 1999 with the United States Department of Justice so provides. <em>See State v. Payton, </em>342 <em>N.J.Super. </em>106, 111-12, 775 A.2d 740 (App.Div.2001); <em>State v. Carty, </em>332 <em>N.J.Super. </em>200, 206, 753 A.2d 149 (App.Div.), <em>certif. granted, </em>165 <em>N.J. </em>605, 762 A.2d 219 (2000).<footnotemark>8</footnotemark> These concerns have <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"358\">*358</page-number>led us to provide discovery in support of a \u201cracial profiling\u201d claim to a defendant who unsuccessfully challenged a \u201cconsent\u201d search by a trooper on the Turnpike. <em>Payton, supra.</em></p>\n<p id=\"b392-5\"><em>We </em>hold that defendant is entitled to discovery in support of his claim of \u201cracial profiling\u201d based on the aggregate of circumstances revealed by this record, including: (1) he filed a timely petition, <em>see R. </em>3:22-12; (2) he filed a timely pretrial motion to suppress the evidence obtained following the stop on the New Jersey Turnpike by a state trooper; (3) the motion to suppress challenged the \u201cconsent search\u201d; (4) the stop and \u201cconsent\u201d search occurred in October 1995, after the time <em>State v. Soto </em>found that \u201cprofiling\u201d by state troopers was occurring on the Turnpike, <em>see </em>324 <em>N.J.Super. </em>at 84-85, 734 A.2d 350, but before the Attorney General and State Police endeavored to remedy the problem, <em>see Ballard, supra, </em>at 542-43, 752 A.2d 735; and (5) defendant challenged the stop and search on his unsuccessful direct appeal. In these circumstances, defendant is entitled to apply to the Designated Judge for discovery to support the claim that he was, in fact, a victim of racial profiling. <em>Cf. State v. Burgess, </em>154 <em>N.J. </em>181, 185, 712 A.2d 631 (1998) (PCR application not barred by <em>R. </em>3:22-4 when issue was unsuccessfully raised in petition for certification).</p>\n<p id=\"b392-6\">The State has consistently acknowledged that \u201cprofiling\u201d violates the Fifth and Fourteenth Amendments, arguing that no Fourth Amendment right is violated, <em>see, e.g., State v. Velez, </em>335 <em>N.J.Super. </em>552, 554-55, 763 A.2d 290 (App.Div.2000), <em>certif. dismissed, </em>167 <em>N.J. </em>624, 772 A.2d 928 (2001), and acknowledges that \u201cprofiling\u201d for drugs has always been unlawful in the context of a Turnpike stop. As such, defendant\u2019s \u201cprofiling\u201d claim does not involve \u201ca new rule of law,\u201d and we therefore face no issue of retroactivity. <em>See Burgess, supra, </em>154 <em>N.J. </em>at 184-85, 712 A.2d 631; <em>State v. Burstein, </em>85 <em>N.J. </em>394, 402-12, 427 A.2d 525 (1981); <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"359\">*359</page-number><em>State v. Yanovsky, </em>340 <em>N.J.Super. </em>1, 7, 773 A.2d 711 (App.Div. 2001); <em>State v. Staruch, </em>326 <em>N.J.Super. </em>245, 251-52, 741 A.2d 110 (App.Div.1999) (all noting that issues of retroactivity are only presented when there has been a departure from existing law); and <em>see generally, Teague v. Lane, </em>489 <em>U.S. </em>288, 299-315,109 <em>S.Ct. </em>1060, 1069-78, 103 <em>L.Ed.2d </em>334, 348-59 (1989), and <em>State v. Purnell, </em>161 <em>N.J. </em>44, 53-64, 735 A.2d 513 (1999) (outlining state and federal tests for determining whether new constitutional rules are to be applied retroactively to collateral attack). This is a case in which the defendant had no evidence to support the claim, and little opportunity of obtaining it before <em>Soto </em>was decided or the <em>Interim Report </em>was filed. In the totality of circumstances before us in this case, therefore, defendant can obtain discovery to pursue his claim on PCR.</p>\n<p id=\"b393-6\">There is no dispute that the Designated Judge has been given jurisdiction to entertain discovery applications on \u201cprofiling\u201d claims by the State Police where they are cognizable.<footnotemark>9</footnotemark> <em>See Ballard, supra, </em>331 <em>N.J.Super. </em>at 548-50, 752 A.2d 735. The Designated Judge shall consider the appropriate discovery in this case, after which defendant can seek reconsideration of his denied PCR petition before the trial judge.</p>\n<p id=\"b393-7\">Our disposition is without prejudice to consideration of defendant\u2019s other grounds for PCR in the event he is unsuccessful on the remand proceedings before the trial judge.<footnotemark>10</footnotemark></p>\n<p id=\"b393-8\">The matter is remanded to the Law Division for further proceedings consistent with this opinion.
