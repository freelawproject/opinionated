Plaintiff Margaret Vassallo<footnotemark>1</footnotemark> alleges that, while working as a sewing worker at the State of New Jersey\u2019s Woodbine Development Center, she was exposed to a product called \u201cResisto marking ink,\u201d produced by defendant American Code and Marking Ink, Inc., and distributed by defendant Natmar Services Corporation. She claims that the exposure to the ink caused her to suffer severe personal injuries, including pulmonary, cerebral, cardiovascular and psychiatric disorders. The trial court granted defendants summary judgment, concluding that plaintiffs experts\u2019 reports failed to present a causation nexus between plaintiffs exposure to the product and her conditions. The court also denied plaintiffs motion for reconsideration. We reverse and remand for an <em>N.J.R.E. </em>104 hearing.</p>\n<p id=\"b244-8\">Considering the evidence in a light most favorable to plaintiff, <em>Brill v. Guardian Life Ins. Co. of Am., </em>142 <em>N.J. </em>520, 666 A.2d 146 (1995), these are the facts. In October 1988, while working at the State\u2019s Woodbine Development Center, plaintiff was exposed to Dursban, a pesticide. She experienced dizziness, headaches, nausea, congestion, .sore throat, chest tightness, cough, and eye irritation. Plaintiff was diagnosed with an upper respiratory tract infection and was treated with antibiotics. However, her condition worsened. In 1989 through 1990, plaintiff was evaluated and treated by a series of physicians and psychiatrists. In February 1990, she was evaluated by Dr. Elissa Ann Favato, an internist specializing in occupational disease. Dr. Favato concluded that plaintiffs symptoms were related to her exposure to Dursban, and <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"211\">*211</page-number>that she suffered from multiple chemical sensitivity disorder (MCSD), an acquired disorder characterized by oversensitivity to \u201cunrelated\u201d chemical compounds \u201cat doses far below those established in the general population to cause harmful effects.\u201d Dr. Favato recommended that plaintiff work in a chemically-free environment.</p>\n<p id=\"b245-6\">In May 1990, plaintiff was transferred to the State\u2019s North Princeton Development Center in Skillman, where she worked as a sewing worker. Part of her work involved marking clothing with labels using a heat seal machine and an ink marking device. That procedure involved the use of a labeling machine pressed onto ink pads. Plaintiff manually re-inked the pad with Resisto marking ink by using a small plastic applicator with a nozzle. She would thereupon use a heat sealing device to permanently label the clothing. According to plaintiff, she spent approximately twenty-five percent of her time marking clothing by use of the ink device and heater.</p>\n<p id=\"b245-7\">In the summer of 1993, plaintiff began suffering from dizzy spells and chest pains while employing the inking device. Her eyes started to burn, and the burning sensation would abate when she was at home. During the period she worked at Skillman, the ventilation system failed on two occasions, and the ink marking machine malfunctioned. As a result, ink would often spill onto her hands. By June 1995, plaintiff began experiencing episodes of chronic sore throat, laryngitis, diarrhea, continued chest pains and burning sensation in her eyes.</p>\n<p id=\"b245-8\">On September 19, 1995, on the advice of a physician, plaintiff terminated her employment with the State. She was thereafter examined by a psychiatrist, a gastroenterologist, and a cardiologist, as well as other physicians. The cardiologist concluded that plaintiff suffered from chest wall pains due to panic attacks. Her chest pain and burning sensation in her eyes continued. She began experiencing episodes of chronic sore throat, laryngitis, and diarrhea.</p>\n<p id=\"b246-4\"><page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"212\">*212</page-number>On April 6, 1996, Dr. Miklos Boezko, a neurologist, examined plaintiff and diagnosed early cerebellar, particularly midline, degeneration, \u201cdirectly and causally related to chemical exposure, including chronic encephalopathy.\u201d In making his diagnosis, Dr. Boezko notes as significant plaintiff\u2019s work exposure to pesticides and \u201cink,\u201d which contained diethylaminoethanol and formaldehyde.</p>\n<p id=\"b246-5\">Dr. Susan Daum, an internist specializing in environmental and occupational medicine, examined plaintiff on January 22,1996. In her report, Dr. Daum noted plaintiffs exposure to Dursban in 1988. She also noted plaintiffs use, from 1990 through 1995, of the Resisto marking ink product, which Dr. Daum found significant. Dr. Daum stated that according to the Resisto\u2019s material safety data sheet (MSDS), the product becomes more caustic when heated. Dr. Daum noted that plaintiffs symptoms worsened during the period she was exposed to the ink and other caustic materials. She concluded that Plaintiff suffered from MCSD, \u201caggravated by exposure to ... formaldehyde, diethylaminoetha-nol or its breakdown products.\u201d</p>\n<p id=\"b246-6\">Dr. G. John DiGregorio, a professor of pharmacology, interviewed plaintiff, reviewed her medical records and, on November 26, 1996, concluded that \u201c[i]t is obvious that her symptoms are related to her exposure to the solvents associated with the ink such [as] formaldehyde. Her disabilities are definitely related to her job and her exposure.\u201d</p>\n<p id=\"b246-7\">Dr. Allan Lieberman, board certified in environmental medicine, rendered three reports dated June 27, 1996, August 29, 1996, and November 16, 1998. After examining plaintiff and reviewing her medical records, Dr. Lieberman concluded that her constant imbalance, chronic pain in the chest wall, breathing difficulties, headaches, cough, diarrhea and dizziness were caused by exposures to \u201cglue, formaldehyde, and pesticides.\u201d He specifically identified Resisto marking ink, \u201ccontaining diethylaminoethanol and formaldehyde\u201d as one of the offending caustic agents. His medical diagnosis was a history of acute and chronic chemical exposures, including organophosphate pesticides in 1988, and \u201cglues, <em>inks, </em><page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"213\">*213</page-number>diethylaminoethanol, formaldehyde and organophosphate pesticides in the workplace\u201d from 1990 through 1995. (Emphasis added).</p>\n<p id=\"b247-5\">In granting summary judgment to defendants, the trial court found that the expert reports submitted by plaintiffs did not address what \u201cneeded to be addressed,\u201d that is, the effect of the toxic substances in the ink, and how exposures to those toxic substances were causally related to plaintiffs medical condition. The court observed that the reports in fact focused predominately on plaintiffs exposure to the pesticide Dursban in 1988, and that \u201c[njone of the reports indicate that the present symptoms that [plaintiff] has ... were directly related in any way or caused by the ink as opposed to other causative forces.\u201d</p>\n<p id=\"b247-6\">Plaintiffs moved for reconsideration. In support of the motion they submitted a second report from Dr. DiGregorio dated November 26, 1999. In the report, the doctor notes that he had examined Resisto\u2019s MSDS and twenty-one medical reports and records of plaintiffs treatment. Dr. DiGregorio again notes that starting in 1990, plaintiff \u201ccame in frequent contact with the use of Resisto Marking Ink.\u201d He concludes that the exposure \u201caggravated a preexisting situation and was a major contributing factor for her persistent neurological and pulmonary problems. Both die-thylaminoethanol and formaldehyde can affect the pulmonary system and the central nervous system.\u201d</p>\n<p id=\"b247-7\">An affidavit of Dr. Lieberman dated October 4, 1999, was also produced. Dr. Lieberman \u201cclarified]\u201d his prior opinions by noting plaintiffs exposure to Dursban in 1988, and that based on his review of the medical records and physical and medical evaluation of plaintiff, her acute symptoms related to her exposure to Durs-ban \u201chad essentially resolved, <em>although she was left in a more sensitized condition.\u201d </em>(Emphasis added). He added that plaintiffs chronic conditions suffered were \u201centirely consistent with the known hazards associated with Resisto Marking Ink\u201d as demonstrated by the product\u2019s MSDS. Knowing that plaintiff had been exposed to multiple caustic agents during her employment, Dr. <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"214\">*214</page-number>Lieberman nevertheless found that \u201cit has always been my opinion that her occupational exposure to Resisto Marking Ink substantially contributed to and/or aggravated her physical problems as enumerated above and in my August 29,1996 report.\u201d In denying the motion for reconsideration the trial court stood by its view that plaintiff had not provided \u201ccausation reports.\u201d As to Drs. DiGregorio\u2019s and Lieberman\u2019s supplemental opinions submitted after the summary judgment order, the court was of the view that:</p>\n<blockquote id=\"Ar_\">It\u2019s too little. It\u2019s too late. The reports aren\u2019t sufficient, I don\u2019t think, to carry the day even if they existed as they exist now. I think you\u2019d still need more in terms of liability reports. This might give you enough to give you causation maybe if we held [an <em>N.J.R.E. </em>403] hearing, but I don\u2019t think it has \u2014 there\u2019s no analysis of the work place by anyone.</blockquote>\n<p id=\"b248-5\">The gravamen of plaintiffs case is that defendants failed to warn plaintiff of the dangerous propensities of the Resisto marking ink product. In such a case, the product-defeet causation element of a cause of action requires the plaintiff \u201cto prove that the absence of a warning was a proximate cause of his harm.\u201d <em>Coffman v. Keene Corp., </em>133 <em>N.J. </em>581, 594, 628 A.2d 710 (1993). In this case, the trial court did not rest its dismissal of plaintiffs complaint on this \u201cproduct-defect causation\u201d element. Instead, its focus in granting defendants summary judgment was lack of medical proofs establishing a nexus between plaintiffs exposure to the product and her medical condition.</p>\n<p id=\"b248-6\">A plaintiff, in products-liability litigation, \u201cmust demonstrate that his or her injuries were proximately caused by exposure to defendant\u2019s ... product.\u201d <em>Ibid.; James v. Bessemer Processing Co., </em>155 <em>N.J. </em>279, 297-98, 714 A.2d 898 (1998). In the toxic-tort field, the modern trend has been to relax or broaden the standard of determining medical causation. <em>See James, supra, </em>155 <em>N.J. </em>at 299-301, 714 A.2d 898; <em>Landrigan v. Celotex Corp., </em>127 <em>N.J. </em>404, 413, 605 A.2d 1079 (1992); <em>Rubanick v. Witco Chem. Corp., </em>125 <em>N.J. </em>421, 434, 593 A.2d 733 (1991). This is because, in the toxic-tort context, \u201cproof that a defendant\u2019s conduct caused decedent\u2019s injuries is more subtle and sophisticated than proof in cases concerned with more traditional torts.\u201d <em>Landrigan, supra,</em></p>\n<p id=\"b249-5\"><page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"215\">*215</page-number>127 <em>N.J. </em>at 413, 605 A.2d 1079. A less traditional standard is essential because, unlike the typical personal injury action, the toxic-tort case often involves: (1) exposure of long duration, chronic and repeated; (2) exposure to multiple toxins; and (3) harm normally resulting from biochemical disruption or acute toxic substance as opposed to physical trauma. <em>James v. Chevron U.S.A., Inc., </em>301 <em>N.J.Super. </em>512, 531, 694 A.2d 270 (App.Div.1997), <em>aff'd sub nom., James v. Bessemer Processing Co., </em>155 <em>N.J. </em>279, 714 A.2d 898 (1998).</p>\n<p id=\"b249-6\">In workplace toxic exposure cases, we have adopted the \u201cfrequency, regularity and proximity\u201d test first pronounced in <em>Sholtis v. American Cyanamid Co., </em>238 <em>N.J.Super. </em>8, 28-29, 568 A.2d 1196 (App.Div.1989), in determining whether plaintiff has made a prima facie case of medical causation. <em>See James, supra, </em>155 <em>N.J. </em>at 300-03, 714 A.2d 898. At least for summary judgment purposes, where there has been exposure to multiple products over an extended period of time, plaintiff has the burden of proving that her exposure to defendant\u2019s product was a \u201c \u2018substantial factor\u2019 causing or exacerbating the plaintiffs illness____\u201d <em>Id. </em>at 301, 714 A.2d 898. Plaintiff must \u201cprove \u2018an exposure of sufficient frequency, with a regularity of contact, and with the product in close proximity\u2019 to the plaintiff.\u201d <em>Ibid. </em>(quoting <em>Sholtis, supra, </em>238 <em>N.J.Super. </em>at 28, 568 A.2d 1196).</p>\n<p id=\"b249-9\">Here, if we credit plaintiffs proofs, we have direct and circumstantial evidence that she was regularly and frequently exposed to Resisto marking ink during her employment with the State during 1990 through 1995. She worked at the Skillman facility from 7:30 a.m. to 3:30 p.m., five days per week, during which she marked clothing labels with the use of a heat seal machine and an ink marking device. The marking device consisted of a wheel, pressed into an ink pad. Plaintiff \u201cre-inked\u201d the pad on a frequent basis. When the ink was applied to the material, a heat sealing machine was applied. Plaintiff spent approximately twenty-five percent of her time marking clothing. Often the air was poorly ventilated. During this time, she experienced dizzy <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"216\">*216</page-number>spells, chest pains, and eye irritation. On some occasions, the ink marking machine malfunctioned causing ink to run onto her hands. In our view, plaintiffs make a prima facie showing that plaintiff was frequently and regularly in close proximity to defendant\u2019s product.</p>\n<p id=\"b250-4\">The critical issue here is whether, indulgently read, the medical reports submitted by plaintiffs were sufficient to overcome defendants\u2019 claim that they failed to demonstrate medical causation. On a motion for summary judgment in a toxic-tort case, the narrow issue is whether reasonable jurors could infer, based on the expert testimony, a nexus between plaintiffs exposure to the offending product and her condition. <em>Sholtis, supra, </em>238 <em>N.J.Super. </em>at 31, 568 A.2d 1196. In that regard, we have noted that summary judgment \u201cis an extraordinary measure to be taken only with extreme caution, especially when a cause of action rests upon expert testimony.\u201d <em>Kisselbach v. County of Camden, </em>271 <em>N.J.Super. </em>558, 569, 638 A.2d 1383 (App.Div.1994). \u201c[TJhe preferred course is to deny summary judgment and permit the matter to proceed, so that the expert\u2019s opinion can be fleshed out.\u201d <em>Ibid.</em></p>\n<p id=\"b250-5\">Fairly read, we cannot agree with the trial court that the reports failed to establish a prima facie case of causation. The reports at least implicitly advance alternative and not necessarily inconsistent theories: (1) plaintiff developed MCSD due to exposure to pesticides (Dursban) in 1988, causing hypersensitivity to the caustic elements in the Resisto-marked product; and (2) the Resisto product alone was a substantial, contributing factor in causing plaintiffs condition. Drs. Lieberman, Daum, DiGregorio and Boczko, all refer to plaintiffs work history in using Resisto marking ink and concluded that plaintiffs conditions are causally related to chronic chemical exposure to diethylaminoethanol and formaldehyde. The MSDS and fact sheets, referred to by the medical experts, state the Resisto marking ink, containing these toxins, can cause diarrhea, eye irritation, breathing difficulties, headaches and dizziness, all being conditions suffered by plaintiff after exposure to the product.</p>\n<p id=\"b251-5\"><page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"217\">*217</page-number>Moreover, Dr. Lieberman\u2019s affidavit and Dr. DiGregorio\u2019s report submitted in support of plaintiffs reconsideration motion should have been considered by the trial court. A trial court should hesitate to preclude late filings in a toxic-tort case. <em>Sholtis, supra, </em>238 <em>N.J.Super. </em>at 17, 568 A.2d 1196. A trial court has discretion to permit supplemental affidavits to be submitted, and this discretion should be exercised to increase, not limit, the likelihood that the information before the court \u201creflects the facts that could be adduced at trial.\u201d <em>Ibid. </em>Dr. Lieberman\u2019s October 4, 1999 affidavit is compelling. He found significant that plaintiff had not been exposed to Dursban after 1988, and that her acute symptoms related to her exposure to that pesticide \u201chad essentially resolved.\u201d However, it was his medical view that plaintiff had been left \u201cin a more sensitized condition\u201d; that is, plaintiff was hypersensitive to other caustic materials. Focusing on plaintiffs medical and work history records, the doctor again defined the caustic ingredients of Resisto, as evidenced by its MSDS, and concluded that her exposure to the product was \u201csubstantially contributed to the development of a severe neurotoxic condition, reactive airways disease, and increased sensitivity.\u201d In our view, these reports were sufficient to overcome defendants\u2019 summary judgment motion.</p>\n<p id=\"b251-6\">The opinions of plaintiffs\u2019 experts should, of course, be examined during an <em>N.J.R.E. </em>104 hearing before being admitted into evidence. Dr. Lieberman, for example, should be permitted to explain the mechanics of diethylaminoethanol and formaldehyde in support of his conclusion that the Resisto product was a substantial factor in causing plaintiffs condition. The focus must be on the data relied on, his methodology, and the reasoning supporting his testimony. <em>Rubanick, supra, </em>125 <em>N.J. </em>at 449, 593 A.2d 733. The admissibility of his testimony and ultimate conclusions will depend upon his \u201cability to explain pertinent scientific principles and to apply those principles to the formulation of [his] opinion. Thus, the key to admission of the opinion is the validity of the expert\u2019s reasoning and methodology.\u201d <em>Landrigan, supra, </em><page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"218\">*218</page-number>127 <em>N.J. </em>at 414, 605 A.2d 1079. This analysis is critical because plaintiffs\u2019 experts, at least in part, rely upon the assumption that plaintiff had developed MCSD as a result of her 1988 exposure to Dursban. Defendants argue that MCSD is not a condition generally accepted by the medical community.</p>\n<p id=\"b252-5\">The experts must also identify the factual bases for their conclusions and \u201cdemonstrate that both the factual bases and the methodology are scientifically reliable.\u201d <em>Id. </em>at 417, 605 A.2d 1079. Moreover, if epidemiological or toxicological studies are to provide the basis for the experts\u2019 opinion, they must be \u201c \u2018soundly and reliably generated\u2019 and be \u2018of a type reasonably relied on by comparable experts in the particular field.\u2019 \u201d <em>Id. </em>at 419-20, 605 A.2d 1079 (quoting <em>Rubanick, supra, </em>125 <em>N.J. </em>at 447, 593 A.2d 733); and <em>see Daubert v. Merrell Dow Pharm., Inc., </em>509 <em>U.S. </em>579, 593-94, 113 <em>S.Ct. </em>2786, 2796-2797, 125 L.Ed.2d 469, 482-83 (1993). After the <em>N.J.R.E. </em>104 hearing is conducted, the trial court should apply its gate-keeping function to determine whether the experts\u2019 opinions are sufficiently reliable to be considered by the jury.</p>\n<p id=\"b252-6\">Reversed and remanded for a <em>N.J.R.E. </em>104 hearing.</p>\n<footnote label=\"1\">\n<p id=\"b244-9\"> Philip Vassallo, plaintiffs husband, sues <em>per quod. </em>We will refer to plaintiff Margaret Vassallo simply as plaintiff.</p>\n</footnote>\n</opinion>\n</casebody>\n",
