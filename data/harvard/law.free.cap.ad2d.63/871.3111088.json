We observe, with respect to the assessment ordered on the issue of damages, that such damages be limited to those, if any, which arose subsequent to plaintiff\u2019s purchase of stock in defendants\u2019 corporation. This view is supported by <em>Austin v Gardiner </em>(188 Mise 538), upon which plaintiff has relied. Concur\u2014Murphy, P. J., Birns, Markewich and Yesawich, JJ.</p>\n</opinion>\n</casebody>\n",
