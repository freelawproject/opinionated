Wilsey appeals from an order of the United States District Court for the Northern District of New York, Edmund Port, J., denying without a hearing Wilsey\u2019s petition under 28 U.S. C. \u00a7 2255 to set aside his four-year sentence, entered in February 1971 after a guilty plea, for conspiring to counterfeit Federal Reserve notes. 18 U.S.C. \u00a7 371. Wilsey claims that the judge, in sentencing him, was improperly influenced by some prior convictions obtained when Wilsey did not have counsel and therefore not to be considered under United States v. Tucker, 404 U.S. 443, 92 S.Ct. 589, 30 L.Ed.2d 592 (1972).<footnotemark>1</footnotemark> The Government argues that the judge\u2019s remarks on the record show that he imposed sentence without relying on any prior unconstitutionally obtained convictions of appellant.</p>\n<p id=\"b683-19\">We view the judge\u2019s comments as ambiguous and the record as unclear. Accordingly, we remand the proceeding so that the district judge may make brief findings as to (1) whether the pre-sentence report contained the challenged convictions; and (2) if so, whether he would have given <em>a </em>different sentence if he had known they were constitutionally invalid. If the answer to both questions is yes, the judge should determine whether the prior convictions were had without counsel, and, if so, he should re-sentence. If the answer to either (1) or (2) is in the negative, the judge should simply make a finding to that effect, cf. <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"620\">*620</page-number>Schawartzberg v.
