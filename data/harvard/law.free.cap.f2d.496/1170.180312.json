Nevertheless, we have reviewed the record, assuming the point was properly presented for review, and find that the error being asserted on appeal, if error at all, was harmless.</p>\n<p id=\"b1235-12\">The jury showed no confusion as to the meaning of the word \u201cconceal.\u201d The Court properly instructed that if the jury found defendant had received the motor vehicle, it would not be necessary to find that he had concealed it, in order to be in violation of 18 U.S.C.A. \u00a7 2313.</p>\n<p id=\"b1235-16\">The jury had indicated in the request for additional instructions that it felt the defendant did receive the automobile but it had no evidence that he concealed it. In view of this, we detect no harm to defendant in failure to define for the jury the meaning of \u201cconceal.\u201d</p>\n</opinion>\n</casebody>\n",
