St. Mary\u2019s Hospital of East St. Louis, Illinois, filed suit under Title XIX of the Social Security Act seeking declaratory and injunctive relief, to enjoin state implementation of new procedures for Medicaid reimbursements. The state filed a counterclaim to recover approximately $927,000 in Medicaid overcharges paid to St. Mary\u2019s Hospital dating back to 1966.</p>\n<p id=\"b1389-16\">On February 16, 1972, the district court issued a preliminary injunction ordering the state to reimburse the hospital for Medicaid services at the 1970 rate of $55.24 per patient day. On July 28, 1972, pursuant to a motion by the hospital, the district court amended the preliminary injunction to require reimbursements at the rate of $60.65 per patient day, retroactive to November 1, 1971. This was a 9.7 percent increase over the prior reimbursement rate. The amended injunction was issued without a requirement that St. Mary\u2019s post security for the overcharges alleged in the counterclaim. The district court denied the state\u2019s motion to vacate, alter, or amend the order of July 28,1972.</p>\n<p id=\"b1389-17\">The state raises two issues on appeal: (1) the applicability of the Economic Stabilization regulations to the Medicaid reimbursements in question; (2) the necessity of requiring, under Rule 65(c), Fed.R.Civ.P., a security deposit for the overcharges as a condition of granting the preliminary injunction.</p>\n<p id=\"b1389-18\">I. JURISDICTION OF THIS COURT.</p>\n<p id=\"b1389-19\">As a preliminary matter, it must be determined whether this court has jurisdiction over the appeal or whether the appeal properly should have been made <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"1326\">*1326</page-number>to the Temporary Emergency Court of Appeals (T.E.C.A.). The jurisdiction of T.E.C.A. is created by \u00a7 211(b)(2) of the Economic Stabilization Act of 1970, 12 U.S.C. \u00a7 1904, which provides:</p>\n<blockquote id=\"AhC\">\u201cExcept as otherwise provided in this section, the Temporary Emergency Court of Appeals shall have exclusive jurisdiction of all appeals from the district courts of the United States in <em>cases and controversies arising under this title </em>or under regulations or orders issued thereunder.\u201d (Emphasis added.)</blockquote>\n<p id=\"b1390-4\">We interpret the phrase \u201carising under\u201d as requiring that the allegations of the complaint, not merely the answer, call for the application of the Economic Stabilization Act to the suit. In the absence of such triggering allegations in the complaint, the court of appeals has jurisdiction over the appeal.</p>\n<p id=\"b1390-5\">This interpretation of \u00a7 211(b)(2) is consistent with interpretations of the same phrase, \u201carising under,\u201d in the context of federal-question jurisdiction in the federal courts. In the latter situation, it has long been held that to invoke the jurisdiction of the federal courts on the basis of a claim \u201carising under\u201d the Constitution or laws of the United States [28 U.S.C. \u00a7 1331], the complaint, and not the answer, must be based on those laws or the Constitution. Louisville &amp; Nashville R. R. Co. v. Mottley, 211 U.S. 149, 152, 29 S.Ct. 42, 53 L.Ed. 126 (1908); Skelly Oil Co. v. Phillips Petroleum Co., 339 U.S. 667, 672, 70 S.Ct. 876, 94 L.Ed. 1194 (1950).</p>\n<p id=\"b1390-6\">Moreover, T.E.C.A. itself recently noted in United States v. Cooper, 482 F.2d 1393, 1398 (Em.App. 1973), that \u201ca loose construction [of \u00a7 211(b)(2)] is unacceptable in light of the traditional rule that courts of special jurisdiction should strictly construe their statutory grants of jurisdiction.\u201d See also Associated Gen. Contractors of America, Inc. v. Laborers Int\u2019l, Local 612, 489 F.2d 749 (Em.App. 1973).</p>\n<p id=\"b1390-7\">In the present case, the allegations of St. Mary\u2019s complaint did not create issues calling for the application of the Economic Stabilization Act. The applicability of the Act was first raised by the state after the preliminary injunction had been issued. In this situation, the case did not \u201carise under\u201d the Act and therefore this court has jurisdiction over the appeal.</p>\n<p id=\"b1390-9\">II. APPLICATION OF THE ECONOMIC STABILIZATION REGULATIONS.</p>\n<p id=\"b1390-10\">Title XIX of the Social Security Act establishes the Medicaid program. Specifically, 42 U.S.C. \u00a7 1396a(a)(13) (D) provides \u201cfor payment of the reasonable cost of inpatient hospital services provided under the plan.\u201d The Economic Stabilization Act authorizes the President to issue orders and regulations to stabilize prices, rents, wages, and salaries. Medicaid reimbursements were specifically frozen under Economic Stabilization regulation No. 305:</p>\n<blockquote id=\"b1390-11\">\u201c[P]ayment schedules established during the base period for medical services provided under the Medicaid program are considered to be prices and are frozen. In effect, then, the Medicaid reimbursements (per unit of service) based on these payment schedules are frozen.\u201d Economic Stabilization Cir. No. 102</blockquote>\n<p id=\"b1390-12\">The Price Commission issued a regulation, effective December 29, 1971, regarding increases in prices of institutional health:</p>\n<blockquote id=\"b1390-13\">\u201c[N]o institutional provider of health services may charge a price in excess of the base price, if the effect of the increase ... is to\u2014</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b1390-14\">-X- * -X- * * *</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b1390-15\">(2) Increase its aggregate annual revenues . . . at an annualized rate of 6 percent over the amount of its aggregate annual revenues for its last fiscal year, unless the provider has received an exception from the Price Commission . . . .\u201d6 C.F.R. \u00a7 300.18 (1973).</blockquote>\n<p id=\"b1390-18\">The district court offered no reason for its finding that the above regulation <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"1327\">*1327</page-number>is inapplicable to its amended order which resulted in a 9.7 percent increase in the Medicaid reimbursement rate. St. Mary\u2019s Hospital, in urging that we find the Economic Stabilization regulations inapplicable, has advanced essentially two arguments.</p>\n<p id=\"b1391-4\">First, the hospital argues that the Economic Stabilization Act and accompanying Executive Orders did not expressly authorize the state welfare agencies to deviate from the provisions of Title XIX of the Social Security Act which requires full reimbursement for Medicaid costs. Application of the Economic Stabilization regulations to Medicaid reimbursements, according to St. Mary\u2019s would violate Title XIX.</p>\n<p id=\"b1391-5\">We find this argument unpersuasive. In its recent decision, American Nursing Home Ass\u2019n v. Cost of Living Council, 497 F.2d 909 (Em.App. 1974), T.E.C.A. held that there is no conflict between \u00a7 300.18, as it applies to nursing care homes, and Titles XVIII and XIX of the Social Security Act. We similarly find no conflict between this Economic Stabilization regulation, as applied to a hospital, and the Social Security Act. Under the Economic Stabilization regulations, a hospital could obtain full reimbursement for any Medicaid costs. The regulations only required that a certain procedure be followed when the aggregate annual revenue increased by a designated percentage.<footnotemark>1</footnotemark> Short-term economic controls do not necessarily conflict with more permanent, long-term legislative schemes \u201csimply because they may impinge or overlap the same sectors of the economy.\u201d <em>Id. </em>at 915. Moreover, the fact that Congress, in the Economic Stabilization Act, did not <em>expressly </em>authorize a deviation from Title XIX is irrelevant. \u201cIf there is no evidence [of either congressional awareness or unawareness], the presumption must be in favor of congressional awareness.\u201d <em>Id. </em>at 916. .</p>\n<p id=\"b1391-10\">The second argument presented by the hospital for not applying the Economic Stabilization regulations to it is that St. Mary\u2019s Medicaid reimbursements do not fall within the terms of \u00a7 300.18(c)(2). The hospital\u2019s argument is essentially two-pronged: (a) the regulation refers to \u201cprice\u201d increases whereas what St. Mary\u2019s is seeking is an increase in reimbursement rates, which are based on costs; (b) even if reimbursement payments are construed as \u201cprices,\u201d the price increase is regulated only if there is a resulting 6 percent increase in <em>aggregate annual revenues, </em>and the latter increase has not been shown.</p>\n<p id=\"b1391-11\">As to the first prong of this argument, \u201cprice\u201d is defined at 6 C.F.R. \u00a7 300.5 (1973) as \u201cany compensation for the sale or lease of any property or services and includes rent, commissions, dues, fees, margins, rates, charges, tariffs, fares, or premiums, regardless of form.\u201d In the commentary on the regulations, \u201cprice\u201d is further explained as including \u201ca direct price paid as well as a price reimbursed to a provider by a third party payer on a cost basis.\u201d 36 Fed.Reg. 25384 (1971).<footnotemark>2</footnotemark> In the present case, the reimbursements are the compensation which the state pays in exchange for St. Mary\u2019s services with re<page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"1328\">*1328</page-number>speet to Medicaid. The reimbursement rate is, thus, the \u201cprice\u201d paid by the state. The \u201cprice\u201d in this situation simply h\u00e1ppens to be statutorily limited to cost.</p>\n<p id=\"b1392-4\">The second prong of St. Mary\u2019s argument regarding the wording of \u00a7 300.18 can also be disposed of by reference to the definitions given in the regulations. St. Mary\u2019s is correct in pointing out that to be within \u00a7 300.18(c)(2), there must be a 6 percent increase in aggregate annual revenues. The revenues referred to, however, are \u201caggregate,\u201d not net, so they must be computed without deducting operating costs. Thus, according to the regulation, \u201caggregate annual revenues\u201d are computed by:</p>\n<blockquote id=\"b1392-5\">\u201c(1) Taking the sum of all patient service revenues for the year concerned .</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b1392-6\">(2) Adding thereto all other operating revenues from services, sales, and activities for the fiscal year concerned</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"AvX\">. and</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b1392-8\">(3) Subtracting from the sum of paragraphs (1) and (2) the amount of the deduction for the year concerned for charity, courtesy, and contractual discounts and allowances for bad debts.\u201d 6 C.F.R. \u00a7 300.18(a) (1973).</blockquote>\n<p id=\"b1392-9\">In the present case, the Medicaid reimbursements would be included in St. Mary\u2019s revenues since we have already determined that these payments represent compensation for patient service. If the district court\u2019s order is upheld, St. Mary\u2019s would have an increase in aggregate revenues of 9.7 percent. St. Mary\u2019s has made no demonstration that it has sufficient \u201ccharity, courtesy, and contractual discounts and allowances for bad debts\u201d to offset this 9.7 percent increase. St. Mary\u2019s has only alluded to rising operational costs, which are not deducted in computing \u201caggregate annual revenues.\u201d<footnotemark>3</footnotemark></p>\n<p id=\"b1392-11\">We conclude that the Economic Stabilization regulations do apply to the 9.7 percent increase in the Medicaid reimbursement rate sought by St. Mary\u2019s. The district court was, therefore, incorrect in ordering the state to pay reimbursements at the increased rate. Rather, St. Mary\u2019s should have followed the administrative procedures set forth in the regulations for receiving an exception.</p>\n<p id=\"b1392-12\">The need to exhaust administrative remedies is particularly strong where the subject matter involved is highly complex, as is the case here. In City of New York v. New York Telephone Co., 468 F.2d 1401 (Em.App. 1972), an action was brought by the city seeking declaratory and injunctive relief against an increase in telephone rates. In denying relief, T.E.C.A. held that the city was required to submit its complaint to the Price Commission before seeking judicial relief. The court noted:</p>\n<blockquote id=\"b1392-13\">\u201cJudicial review is surely hindered by the failure of the litigant to give the agency an opportunity to make a factual record, exercise its discretion or apply its expertise. The Commission is confronted with difficult tasks which require considerable specialized acumen. . . . Finally, frequent deliberate skirting of the Commission may well result in an erosion of effectiveness and public confidence in the Commission which we must recall is a \u2018collaborative instrumentalit[y] of justice.\u2019 \u201d 468 F.2d at 1403.</blockquote>\n<p id=\"b1392-15\">See also McKart v. United States, 395 U.S. 185, 193-195, 89 S.Ct. 1657, 23 L.Ed.2d 194 (1969); Anderson v. Dunlop, 485 F.2d 666, 669-670 (Em.App. 1973).</p>\n<p id=\"b1392-16\">III. SECURITY DEPOSIT.</p>\n<p id=\"b1392-17\">The state argues that the district court erred in ordering it to pay Medicaid reimbursements without conditioning the order upon the hospital\u2019s giving <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"1329\">*1329</page-number>security for the overcharges alleged in the counterclaim. Since we have found the district court\u2019s order regarding the reimbursements to be erroneous, we need not decide whether a security deposit was necessary under Rule 65(c), Fed.R.Civ.P.</p>\n<p id=\"b1393-5\">Accordingly, the preliminary injunction ordering the state to pay Medicaid reimbursements at a rate 9.7 percent higher than the previous rate is reversed, the preliminary injunction is vacated, and the case remanded for further proceedings consistent with this opinion.</p>\n<p id=\"b1393-6\">Reversed and remanded.</p>\n<footnote label=\"1\">\n<p id=\"b1391-6\">. The method for obtaining an \u201cexception\u201d to the 6 percent limitation is specifically set out in Subpart 0 of 6 C.F.R. \u00a7 305 (1973). In applying for an exception, St. Mary\u2019s could have presented information as to the particular operational costs it had encountered which justified the increased reimbursement rate. One of the central concepts of the control plan is that the program is to be kept flexible through a system of exceptions based on individual \u2014 rather than industry-wide \u2014 costs and profits. See Comment, Administration and Judicial Review of Economic Controls, 39 U.Clii.L.Rev. 566, 575-76 (1972).</p>\n</footnote>\n<footnote label=\"2\">\n<p id=\"b1391-13\">. \u201cIn interpreting the specific wording of the regulation, the Court must place great weight upon an agency\u2019s interpretation of its own regulation.\u201d United States v. Lieb, 462 F.2d 1161, 1166 (Em.App.1972). See also Thorpe v. Housing Authority, 393 U.S. 268, 276, 89 S.Ct. 518, 21 L.Ed.2d 474 (1969); United States v. Electrical Workers, Local 11, 475 F.2d 1204, 1209 (Em.App.1973).</p>\n</footnote>\n<footnote label=\"3\">\n<p id=\"b1392-10\">. Even though St. Mary\u2019s presumably had patients other than those in the Medicaid category, we note (a) a substantial part of the hospital\u2019s services were rendered to Medicaid patients and (b) there is no basis for thinking that St. Mary\u2019s claimed cost increases would not have also been reflected in the revenues generated by non-Medicaid patients.</p>\n</footnote>\n</opinion>\n</casebody>\n",
