Both sought th\u00e9 same tract of land as an Indian allotment. The tract, 160 acres of the public domain located north of Hoopa in Humboldt County, California,<footnotemark>1</footnotemark> was originally patented in 1907 to Nancy Burrill, grandmother of Edward and Irene. Since Nancy Burrill lived on land previously allotted to her on the Hoopa Valley Indian Reservation, she allowed her son, Edward Mitchell, Sr., father of the litigants, to establish a home on the public domain allotment. Edward Mitchell, Sr. occupied and improved the land. After his death his wife, Theresa Mitchell, lived on the land until 1953. Appellee Irene has occupied the allotment since 1953.</p>\n<p id=\"b92-18\">The Bureau of Indian Affairs eventually discovered that Nancy Burrill had illegally received both the 160-acre public domain allotment and the prior allotment on the Hoopa Valley Indian Reservation. Accordingly, on May 16, 1957, the public domain allotment patent was cancelled and the land restored to the public domain pursuant to the Act of April 23, 1904, as amended, 25 U.S.C. \u00a7 343.</p>\n<p id=\"b92-19\">On July 16, 1957, Irene and her brother Edward simultaneously filed Indian allotment applications for the 160-acre tract of land under Section 4 of the General Allotment Act of 1887, as amended, 25 U.S.C. \u00a7 334. As a result of a drawing in September 1957 to determine the priority of the two applications, the Bu<page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"29\">*29</page-number>reau of Land Management (\u201cBLM\u201d) awarded Irene -the entire tract. On appeal, the decision was vacated by the BLM Director because the land had not been classified.</p>\n<p id=\"b93-5\">Since 1934 land in the public domain may not be disposed of by an Indian allotment until it has been classified as irrigable, nonirrigable agricultural or nonirrigable grazing land. The regulatory scheme was changed in 1934 when the Secretary of the Interior, pursuant to Executive Order 6910, withdrew all public lands in the ten western states from settlement. \u201cThereafter, classification by the Secretary was a prerequisite to * * * Indian settlement. Section 7 of the Taylor Grazing Act, 43 U.S.C. \u00a7 315(f), authorized the Secretary \u2018in his discretion, to examine and classify any lands withdrawn or reserved\u2019 by the executive orders. Bronken v. Morton, 473 F.2d 790, 793 (9th Cir. 1973).\u201d Kale v. United States, 489 F.2d 449 (9th Cir., 1973).</p>\n<p id=\"b93-6\">On remand a BLM examiner recommended that 80 acres of the tract be classified as nonirrigable' agricultural land and 80 acres be classified as nonirrigable grazing land. The examiner\u2019s report described the land as steep, rough terrain with several drainages and two small creeks. Valuable improvements had been made by the litigants\u2019 parents. Approximately 12 acres of land had been cleared. The grazing area was almost entirely covered by valuable timber. There were several structures in various states of disrepair. Most of the improvements, including a house, barn and fences, were located on the agricultural portion. The examiner concluded that:</p>\n<blockquote id=\"A2\"><em>\u201cWhile it would not be considered an economic unit by itself, </em>the tract would constitute a good home, with a few repairs being made, for an individual who might obtain employment in the number of lumber mills located in the Hoopa Valley and has been proven so in view of the long and continued occupancy by Mrs. Theresa Mitchell and her children.\u201d (Emphasis ours.)</blockquote>\n<p id=\"b93-15\">The examiner indicated that the equities favored Edward because he was willing to provide a home for his mother and therefore recommended that he be awarded the improved portion of the tract, the nonirrigable agricultural land,, and that Irene be awarded the unimproved portion, the nonirrigable grazing land.<footnotemark>2</footnotemark></p>\n<p id=\"b94-3\"><page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"30\">*30</page-number>The recommendations of the examiner were accepted by the BLM and on July 5, 1960, a patent for the 80 acres of non-irrigable grazing land was issued to Irene and a patent for the 80 acres of non-irrigable agricultural land was issued to Edward. Irene then petitioned the BLM Director to cancel the patents and to divide the land differently. The petition was dismissed. The Secretary of Interi- or affirmed the decision of the Director of the BLM.<footnotemark>3</footnotemark></p>\n<p id=\"b94-12\">Pursuant to 25 U.S.C. \u00a7 345<footnotemark>4</footnotemark> and 28 U.S.C. \u00a7 1353,<footnotemark>5</footnotemark> Irene brought the present suit against the United States and her brother<footnotemark>6</footnotemark> in the District Court for the Northern District of California claiming that she had been wrongfully denied her right to an allotment by the Government and that the allotment issued to her brother was contrary to law. Notwithstanding the prior classification of the land by the Secretary of the Interior, the District Court found the entire <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"31\">*31</page-number>tract to be nonirrigable grazing land, also that Edward was statutorily ineligible for an allotment. Accordingly, it ordered the cancellation of his patent and the issuance of a patent for that land to Irene in addition to the lands already allotted to her.</p>\n<p id=\"b95-5\">The District Court\u2019s principal findings of fact and conclusions of law are quoted in the margin.<footnotemark>7</footnotemark> It will be observed that it refrained from stating what standard of review it applied in reversing the Secretary\u2019s classification of the 80 acres allotted to Edward, and likewise refrained from stating its reason for cancelling Edward\u2019s allotment and ordering the issuance of a trust patent for those lands to the plaintiff Pallin. We surmise that Edward\u2019s allotment was cancelled because the Court found he was an Indian living on an Indian Reservation at the time he applied for the allotment. Such Indians are specifically excluded by 25 U.S.C. \u00a7 334 from allotments of non-reservation land.</p>\n<p id=\"b95-6\">We therefore are called upon to decide what is the proper standard of review by a District Court of the Secretary of Interior\u2019s decision in granting these allotments in an action brought pursuant to 25 U.S.C. \u00a7 345 and 28 U.S.C. \u00a7 1353. Such a determination in turn fixes the scope of appellate review of factual determinations by a trial court. <em>Cf., </em>F.R. C.P. 52. In addition, we must decide whether it was error to review and reverse the Secretary\u2019s classification of the tract.</p>\n<p id=\"b95-16\">It is common ground that the District Court held a trial <em>de novo </em>on the classification by the Secretary of the 160 acres allotted to Irene and Edward. It heard and accepted the testimony of an associate timberland and timber properties appraiser employed by the Humboldt County Assessor\u2019s Office, who opined that no portion of the 160-acre tract constituted agricultural land but admitted on cross-examination that he applied the standards of the Humboldt County Assessor\u2019s Office and did not know what standards the Secretary of Interior applied in the classification of lands under the Taylor Grazing Act (Tr. 15). <em>Cf., </em>Regulations 43, C.F.R. \u00a7 176.-9(b) (I960).<footnotemark>8</footnotemark> It also obviously rejected the testimony of Edward Mitchell and his mother and another relative to the effect that a considerable part of the tract was used for agricultural purposes for many years.</p>\n<p id=\"b96-3\"><page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"32\">*32</page-number>Although the scope of review by a District Court of Indian allotments made by the Secretary of Interior is not crystal clear, we are satisfied that in an action brought by an Indian under 25 U.S.C. \u00a7 345 and 28 U.S.C. \u00a7 1353, Congress has given to the District Court original jurisdiction to determine whether, in actions involving the right to an allotment under the General Allotment Act, 25 U.S.C. \u00a7 334 the Secretary acted within the limits Congress has placed on him. Hopkins v. United States, 414 F. 2d 464 (9th Cir. 1969); Finch v. United States, 387 F.2d 13 (10th Cir. 1967), cert. denied, 390 U.S. 1012, 88 S.Ct. 1262, 20 L.Ed.2d 162 (1968).</p>\n<blockquote id=\"b96-4\">In <em>Hopkins </em>we held:</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b96-5\">\u201c25 U.S.C. \u00a7 345 and 28 U.S.C. \u00a7 1353 give district courts original jurisdiction of actions involving the right to an allotment under the General Allotment Act. Plaintiffs\u2019 contention that the Secretary exceeded powers conferred upon him by the governing statutes is subject to judicial review in such a suit.\u201d (Citations and footnote omitted.) 414 F.2d at 466.</blockquote>\n<p id=\"b96-6\">Sections 345 and 1353 give the District Court original jurisdiction of actions involving <em>the right to an allotment </em>under the General Allotment Act, 25 U. S.C. \u00a7 334. Both plaintiff Irene and her brother Edward were, in fact, given an allotment. What was at issue in the court below was Irene\u2019s claim (1) that Edward was not entitled to an allotment because (a) he was living on an Indian Reservation at the time he applied and (b) that he had not made settlement on such land, and (2) that she alone was entitled to the entire tract of 160 acres because (a) she had made settlement and was living on it since 1953 and (b) the entire tract of 160 acres was nonirrigable grazing land and (c) that under the General Allotment Act she was entitled to an allotment of 160 acres of non-irrigable grazing land.<footnotemark>9</footnotemark></p>\n<p id=\"b96-10\">The <em>rights </em>to an allotment thus put in issue were (1) Edward\u2019s right to an allotment, and (2) Irene\u2019s right to the entire 160 acres.</p>\n<p id=\"b96-11\">We hold that the District Court quite properly received evidence negating Edward\u2019s <em>right </em>to an allotment. Such evidence tended to prove that at the filing time he was living with his wife on an Indian Reservation and was therefore statutorily ineligible for an allotment of land in the public domain. 25 U.S.C. \u00a7 334. The District Court accordingly had the power to order his allotment cancelled. 25 U.S.C. \u00a7 345.</p>\n<p id=\"b96-12\">Every case but one that we have found has consistently held that the trial court could review the facts before the Secretary in determining whether the plaintiff Indian had a right to an allotment. United States v. Pierce, 235 F.2d 885 (6th Cir. 1956) (Agua Caliente Band of Mission Indians had the right to have their allotments equalized and the lower court could proceed to do just that unless it was assured that the Indian Service would proceed with diligence) ; Sloan v. United States, 118 F. 283 (C.C.D.Neb.1902), appeal dismissed, 193 U.S. 614, 24 S.Ct. 570, 48 L.Ed. 814 (1904) (reviewed evidence on the issue whether plaintiffs were members of the Omaha Tribe so as to be entitled to allotment in the tribal reservation); Waldron v. United States, 143 F. 413 <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"33\">*33</page-number>(C.C.D.S.D.1905) (the court found on evidence that plaintiff was in fact an Indian and entitled to an allotment); Guyett v. McWhirk, 154 F. 784 (C.C.D. Or.1907) (two Indians applied for allotment of the same parcel of land, and reviewing the evidence the court affirmed the decision of the Interior Department that defendant had the superior right); Sully v. United States, 195 F. 113 (C.C. D.S.D.1912) (contrary to the Department of Interior, the court held on evidence that plaintiff was of Indian blood and entitled to an allotment). In Daniels v. United States, 247 F.Supp. 193 (W.D.Okl.1965), the plaintiff, in an action undoubtedly brought under 25 U.S. C. \u00a7 345 although jurisdiction was not discussed, sought a grant of an Indian allotment to a specific tract of land which the Secretary of Interior had refused to classify and open for entry as requested by plaintiff in an Indian allotment application. The district court held previously that the decision of the Secretary was subject to judicial review under the provisions of the Administrative Procedure Act and determined that a trial <em>de novo </em>was improper, since all proper factors appeared to have been considered and weighed in the Secretary\u2019s decision. This case has not been followed by any other case on the issue of the application of the Administrative Procedure Act in an Indian allotment case.</p>\n<p id=\"b97-5\"> Whether Irene was entitled to the entire 160-acre tract presented an entirely different issue to the District Court. As we indicated above, the regulatory scheme of Indian allotments was changed in 1934 when the Secretary of Interior withdrew all public lands in the ten western states from settlement. Thereafter, classification by the Secretary was a prerequisite to Indian settlement, so that at the time of Irene\u2019s application for the allotment of the 160-acre tract settlement was not a condition precedent,<footnotemark>10</footnotemark> and before any allotment could be made the Secretary was authorized by \u00a7 7 of the Taylor Grazing Act, 43 U.S.C. \u00a7 315f, \u201cin his discretion, to examine and classify any lands withdrawn or reserved\u201d by the Executive Orders. (See p. 29 <em>swpra.) </em>Thus, the principal question presented, with reference to Irene, was whether or no the District Court properly held a trial <em>de novo </em>concerning the Secretary\u2019s classification of the tract.</p>\n<p id=\"b97-7\">We hold that it was error for the District Court to conduct such a trial and that it lacked jurisdiction to review the Secretary\u2019s classification.</p>\n<p id=\"b97-8\">25 U.S.C. \u00a7 345 and 28 U.S.C. \u00a7 1353 give to the District Court original jurisdiction in actions involving the <em>right to an allotment </em>to review the decision of the Secretary of Interior. The classification of lands in the public domain by the Secretary of Interior is not a duty or obligation imposed on him by the General Allotment Act of 1887, as amended (25 U.S.C. \u00a7 334), but rather by \u00a7 7 of the Taylor Grazing Act (Act of June 28, 1934), 43 U.S.C. \u00a7 315f, which reads in part:</p>\n<blockquote id=\"b97-9\">\u201cThe Secretary of the Interior is hereby authorized, <em>in his discretion, </em>to examine and classify any lands withdrawn or reserved by Executive order of November 26, 1934 (numbered 6910), * * * which are more valuable or suitable for the production of agricultural crops than for the production of native grasses and forage plants, or more valuable or suitable for any other use than for the use provided for under this chapter, * * *. <em>Such lands shall not be subject to disposition, settlement, or occupation until after the same have been classified and opened to </em>entry: * * (Emphasis supplied.)</blockquote>\n<p id=\"b97-12\">It is obvious that the two Acts, the General Allotment Act and the Taylor Grazing Act, serve two different purposes, <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"34\">*34</page-number>and what we said above concerning the jurisdiction of the District Court under \u00a7 345 and \u00a7 1353 relates exclusively to an Indian\u2019s <em>right </em>to an allotment. The Taylor Grazing Act, particularly \u00a7 7, imposes the duty on the Secretary of Interior to classify the lands withdrawn pursuant to the Executive Orders, and such classification, Congress said, was to be in his discretion.</p>\n<p id=\"b98-4\">Such discretion is specifically excluded from review by the Administrative Procedure Act, 5 U.S.C. \u00a7 701(a) (2), for there it is provided:</p>\n<blockquote id=\"b98-5\">\u201c(a) This chapter applies, according to the provisions thereof, except to the extent that\u2014</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b98-6\">******</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b98-7\">\u201c(2) agency action is committed to agency discretion by law.\u201d</blockquote>\n<p id=\"b98-8\">Although we have been unable to find any case, nor has any been referred to us, which deals specifically with classification by the Secretary of the Interior for Indian allotment purposes, except <em>Daniels, supra, </em>similar attacks on the Secretary\u2019s classification by non-Indians have been held nonreviewable. Sellas v. Kirk, 200 F.2d 217 (9th Cir.), cert. denied, 345 U.S. 940, 73 S.Ct. 831, 97 L. Ed. 1366 (1953). <em>Cf., </em>Lutzenhiser v. Udall, 432 F.2d 328 (9th Cir. 1970).</p>\n<p id=\"b98-9\">In Bronken v. Morton, 473 F.2d 790 (9th Cir.), cert. denied, 414 U.S. 828, 94 S.Ct. 51, 38 L.Ed.2d 62 (1973), an action was brought by holders of Valentine scrip to review the Secretary of Interi- or\u2019s refusal to issue patents to public lands. There we said:</p>\n<blockquote id=\"b98-10\">\u201cWhile it is true, as the district court observed, that the Secretary\u2019s discretion in classifying public lands is quite broad, it is equally true that this discretion is not absolute. His decisions are beyond judicial scrutiny only when he possesses discretion, and he acts within the limits Congress has placed on this discretion.\u201d 473 F.2d at 794.</blockquote>\n<p id=\"b98-12\">In <em>Bronken </em>the Secretary\u2019s discretion in making a classification decision was limited by a 1964 statute which mandated that classification was to be made \u201cunder existing law.\u201d The Secretary\u2019s land-use regulations, adopted in 1966, could not be applied to pre-1966 applications.</p>\n<p id=\"b98-13\">The classification made by the Secretary in <em>Pallin </em>was not limited in any wise by any Congressional mandate or statute.</p>\n<p id=\"b98-14\">In any event, the District Court could not hold a trial <em>de novo </em>on the classification issue under the Administrative Procedure Act. The Supreme Court, in Camp v. Pitts, 411 U.S. 138, 93 S.Ct. 1241, 36 L.Ed.2d 106 (1973), said:</p>\n<blockquote id=\"b98-15\">\u201c. . . <em>de novo </em>review is appropriate only where there are inadequate factfinding procedures in an adjudicatory proceeding, or where judicial proceedings are brought to enforce certain administrative actions.\u201d 411 U. S. at 142, 93 S.Ct. at 1244.</blockquote>\n<p id=\"b98-17\"><em>Pallin </em>is not a case in which factfinding procedures were inadequate, nor is it a proceeding to enforce administrative action. <em>Cf., </em>Citizens to Preserve Overton Park v. Volpe, 401 U.S. 402, 91 S.Ct. 814, 28 L.Ed.2d 136 (1971).</p>\n<p id=\"b98-18\">The Secretary, however, was in error in granting an allotment to each of the litigants because he applied the wrong standard. In short, the standard is whether the acreage, whatever it is (agricultural or grazing), will provide a home and furnish a livelihood to an Indian and his family by farming, grazing livestock, or both. In <em>Hopkins, supra, </em>we defined the purpose of the General Allotment Act as follows:</p>\n<blockquote id=\"b98-19\">\u201c * * * And the legislative history of the Act supports the conclusion that one of the standards to be applied by the Secretary in making <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"35\">*35</page-number>the determinations required by section 1 is whether the reservation lands selected for allotment are capable of yielding support for an Indian settler and his family. If the lands are too poor to accomplish this purpose, the Secretary is not to approve the allotment.</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b99-5\">\u201cSection 4 of the General Allotment Act, applicable to Indians <em>not </em>residing on a reservation, is to be read with the same limitations. This section expressly provides that allotments to non-reservation Indians are to be made in the same \u2018quantities and manner\u2019 as allotments to reservation Indians under section 1. Moreover, the legislative purpose to authorize allotments only upon lands which the Secretary determined could provide a home and furnish a livelihood by farming, raising livestock, or both, applies to the General Allotment Act as a whole.</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b99-6\">\u201cSection 4 of the General Allotment Act has long been so construed by the Secretary of Interior, and is so construed today. Judicial authority is to the same effect.\u201d (Footnotes omitted.) 414 F.2d at 468.</blockquote>\n<p id=\"b99-7\">What the Secretary did in this case was to adopt the reasoning of his subordinate, namely, that equity favored the giving of 80 acres to Edward, who had promised to permit his mother to live on the land, and 80 acres to Irene because of her settlement, despite the fact that there was a specific finding that the land itself could not support an Indian and his family.</p>\n<p id=\"b99-8\">The judgment of the District Court is affirmed insofar as it ordered the cancellation of Edward Elmer Mitchell, Jr.\u2019s allotment, and\" reversed in all other respects, and the matter remanded to the Secretary for action consistent with this opinion. Each party to bear its own costs.</p>\n<p id=\"b99-9\">Judgment affirmed in part and reversed in part.</p>\n<footnote label=\"1\">\n<p id=\"b92-20\">. The land is described as the ESWW and S% SEt4 of Section 29 Township 10 North, Range 4 East, Humboldt Meridian, California.</p>\n</footnote>\n<footnote label=\"2\">\n<p id=\"b93-7\">. The Examiner\u2019s report stated:</p>\n<blockquote id=\"b93-8\">\u201cWhen, first considering the possibility of awarding the tracts to one of the subject applicants the Bureau requested that the Bureau of Indian Affairs, since they were possibly more intimately acquainted with the domestic affairs of these two people, make any suggestions or recommendations, in relation to the equities involved. They replied as follows: \u2018In relation to the equities involved, it has been the opinion of this office that Mrs. Theresa Mitchell or her assignees may be entitled to major equities in any improvements or values, if any, that can be considered apart from the land values involved. If land equities, established through long use are involved, it would appear that members of the (Mitchell) family willing to provide a home for the mother might perhaps warrant strong consideration for that portion of the tract where the improvements were made by Mrs. Mitchell and her husband. Mrs. Pallin, being one of the younger members of the family, has contributed little labor and little or no money to the establishment of the improvements or to the development of the land. Perhaps Mrs. Pallin could be alloted the unimproved portion of the former allotment, with the improved eighty acres being awarded to Edward Elmer Mitchell, Jr., who is apparently willing to grant the mother the right to use the home for the balance of her life time.\u2019 \u201cThe above would indicate a strong desire on the part of the local Bureau of Indian Affairs personnel to make amends for the mistake made by the federal government in non-cancellation of the Nancy Burrill allotment, No. 108 some fifty-three years ago with the consequent quasi-occupancy of the land since 1907. There is the implied feeling that Mrs. Mitchell or her descendants have some possessary rights in the improvements and the land that should be recognized. If this be the case, then the attached attestation by Mrs. Mitchell that she preferred her son, Mr. Edward Elmer Mitchell, Jr. receive any rights that she might have in the original allotment <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"30\">*30</page-number>should also he recognized and the portion of the lands with the house and other improvements should be awarded to the son, with the remainder of the land being awarded to the daughter.</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b94-5\">\u201cThe subject tract is located in an area where such a tract of public domain would be isolated from other public (vacant) domain of any great size, would be extremely difficult to administer, would be highly susceptible to logging trespass and would eventually be disposed of in the normal course of proper management and in placing the land to its highest and best use.</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b94-6\">\u201cIn view of the above, it is recommended by the undersigned that: The S% SE14 Section 29, T. 10 N. 2, R. 4W, H.M. be classified as non-irrigable grazing land, that the E% SW% Section 29, T. 10 N.
