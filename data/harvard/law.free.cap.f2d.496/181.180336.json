Most of the cocaine was then removed by the agents, and soap powder substituted. The new mixture, containing less than three per cent cocaine, was put back into the packet, the packet was dusted with fluorescent powder, and was replaced in the parcel. After the reconstituted parcel arrived in Boston, a post office notice card was delivered to appellant\u2019s address. Appellant thereupon presented the card at the mail station and asked for the parcel, but was told that the parcel was unavailable, and that he should consult with the post office superintendent. Appellant then left the mail station. The next day the parcel was delivered to appellant\u2019s address. Appellant agreed to receive the parcel, although he stated that the parcel was not addressed to him, and that the addressee picked up his mail at that address periodically.</p>\n<p id=\"b246-13\">Government agents then obtained a warrant to search appellant\u2019s apartment. There they found a small spoon, which appeared to have some residue upon it, but did not find the parcel. The residue was subsequently analyzed to contain cocaine. The parcel itself was discovered, unwrapped and without the cocaine-soap powder mixture, within a plastic garbage bag which agents had observed being placed on the sidewalk outside the building by the building landlord. The agents then used an ultraviolet lamp to inspect appellant\u2019s hands for traces of fluorescent powder. After the test revealed traces of the powder, appellant was placed under arrest.</p>\n<p id=\"b246-14\">Appellant contends that the results of the inspection of his hands should have been suppressed at trial, since the inspection was, in effect, a personal search unauthorized by the warrant to search the premises. There can be little doubt that an inspection of one\u2019s hands, under an ultraviolet lamp, is the kind of governmental intrusion into one\u2019s private domain that is protected by the Fourth Amendment. Mancusi v. DeForte, 392 U.S. 364, 88 S.Ct. 2120, 20 L.Ed.2d 1154 (1968); Warden v. Hayden, 387 U.S. 294, 87 S.Ct. 1642, 18 L.Ed.2d 782 (1967). If the reach of the Fourth Amendment extends to fingerprinting, Davis v. Mississippi, 394 U.S. 721, 89 S.Ct. 1394, 22 L.Ed.2d 676 (1969), and a search of one\u2019s clothing or personal effects, United States v. Micheli, 487 F.2d 429 (1st Cir. 1973), it should certainly encompass a detailed inspection, by special instrument, of one\u2019s skin.<footnotemark>1</footnotemark></p>\n<p id=\"b247-4\"><page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"183\">*183</page-number>It is no answer for the government to argue that the ultraviolet inspection actually protected appellant\u2019s privacy by obviating the necessity of a physical search of his person, since the search warrant gave the government agents no authority to conduct a personal search. <em>Micheli, supra. </em>The protection afforded an individual by the Fourth Amendment would be eviscerated if, under authority of a warrant to search premises, government agents could scan an individual\u2019s body with sensitive instruments capable of picking up the most minute or intimate object lodged thereon.</p>\n<p id=\"b247-5\">The government urges, alternatively, that even if the Fourth Amendment applies, the search was justified as being incidental to a lawful arrest. Although appellant had not been placed under arrest when the search was conducted, it has been held that a personal search is justifiable as incidental to arrest if an arrest is made immediately after the search and if at the time of the search there was probable cause to arrest. Bailey v. United States, 128 U. S.App.D.C. 354, 389 F.2d 305, 308 (1968). See also Chimel v. California, 395 U.S. 752, 89 S.Ct. 2034, 23 L.Ed.2d 685 (1969); United States v. Brown, 150 U.S.App.D.C. 113, 463 F.2d 949 (1972). These criteria must, of course, be strictly construed to avoid the possibility that the search is aimed at retrieving enough evidence to provide probable cause for arrest, or that the arrest is simply a pretext for the search. See United States v. Lefkowitz, 285 U.S. 452, 52 S.Ct. 420, 76 L.Ed. 877 (1932).</p>\n<p id=\"b247-6\">Here the government knew that the parcel bore appellant\u2019s address and that the appellant had attempted to retrieve it long before agents entered the premises. Of course, law enforcement officers may postpone arrest in the hope that they may strengthen their case by uncovering further evidence, \u201c[b]ut every time there is delay in the making of the arrest and there is a search made as incidental to the arrest, the law enforcement officers take the risk that they will be charged with using the arrest as a mere pretext for the search.\u201d Carlo v. United States, 286 F.2d 841 (2d Cir. 1961), cert. denied, 366 U.S. 944, 81 S. Ct. 1672, 6 L.Ed.2d 855 (1961).</p>\n<p id=\"b247-9\">The remaining items of evidence gathered prior to inspection of appellant\u2019s hands \u2014 the spoon with some residue on it and the discarded parcel in the garbage bag outside \u2014 provided some circumstantial evidence. Despite the characterization in the government\u2019s brief we are not able to ascertain from the record whether the spoon was of the type uniquely associated with the use of cocaine or was of a garden variety type. If the evidence were of the former nature, the government\u2019s claim of probable cause would be more persuasive. We make no final determination on the point, however, since appellant\u2019s next contention requires reversal. On remand, the district court will have further opportunity to decide whether there was probable cause for arrest before inspection of appellant\u2019s hands. Factors to be considered might include whether or not the spoon and its residue had unique characteristics which would signal narcotics activity.</p>\n<p id=\"b247-10\">We turn to appellant\u2019s second contention which, as noted, we find dispositive of his appeal. 18 U.S.C. \u00a7 545 under which appellant was convicted, provides, in part, that \u201cwhoever knowingly . smuggles . . . into the United States any merchandise that should have been invoiced ... or knowingly imports merchandise contrary to law\u201d shall be <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"184\">*184</page-number>guilty of a felony. It also provides that \u201c[p]roof of defendant\u2019s possession of such goods, unless explained to the satisfaction of the jury, shall be deemed evidence sufficient to authorize conviction for violation of this section.\u201d</p>\n<p id=\"b248-4\">In Turner v. United States, 396 U.S. 398, 90 S.Ct. 642, 24 L.Ed.2d 610 (1970), the Supreme Court struck down the statutory presumption in 21 U.S.C. \u00a7 174, which imputed knowing importation of cocaine from a mere unexplained showing of possession of cocaine. The Court reasoned that since more cocaine is lawfully produced in this country than is smuggled into this country, the statutory presumption could not satisfy the \u201cmore-likely-than-not\u201d standard for validating statutorily authorized inferences enunciated in Leary v. United States, 395 U.S. 6, 89 S.Ct. 1532, 23 L.Ed.2d 57 (1969). <em>See </em>Barnes v. United States, 412 U.S. 837, 93 S.Ct. 2357, 37 L.Ed.2d 380 (1973).<footnotemark>2</footnotemark> Precisely the same presumption, when applied to cocaine, is featured in 18 U.S.C. \u00a7 545, except that here the government has the added burden of showing illegal importation. If the presumption could not pass constitutional muster in one part of the Code, it cannot in another.</p>\n<p id=\"b248-5\">The government contends, in effect, that since the court instructed the jury that each element of the crime had to be proven beyond a reasonable doubt, the possible effect of any unconstitutional inference within the statute would be eliminated. But the court also familiarized the jury with the statute itself, and alerted the jury to the statutory presumption contained therein: \u201cIt also states that proof of the defendant\u2019s possession of such goods, unless explained to the satisfaction of the jury shall be deemed evidence sufficient to authorize conviction for violation of this section.\u201d We have no way of knowing to what extent the jury based its finding upon this unconstitutional inference.</p>\n<p id=\"b248-9\">Nor is it relevant that the jury might have had ample circumstantial evidence on which to base a finding of knowledge of illegal importation of cocaine, beyond a reasonable doubt. The due process guarantee of a rational statutory presumption in <em>Leary </em>and <em>Turner </em>may pose a constitutional right \u201cso basic to a fair trial that their infraction can never be treated as harmless error.\u201d Chapman v. California, 386 U.S. 18, 23, 87 S.Ct. 824, 827, 17 L.Ed.2d 705 (1967); <em>see </em>Bollenbach v. United States, 326 U.S. 607, 614-615, 66 S.Ct. 402, 90 L.Ed. 350 (1946). <em>But see </em>United States v. Matalon, 425 F.2d 70 (2d Cir. 1970). But even if the unconstitutional presumption could amount to no more than harmless error in certain circumstances, in the present instance we are unable to say that it was harmless. Appellant might have had knowledge of illegal importation if he had seen the postmark on the parcel, if he understood that the postmark was derived from outside the United States, and if he had reason to know that the importation was illegal. But the government offered no direct evidence to substantiate any of these possibilities, nor did it offer \u201coverwhelming\u201d circumstantial evidence. Harrington v. California, 395 U.S. 250, 89 S.Ct. 1726, 23 L.Ed.2d 284 (1969). On this record, we are unable to say that the error was harmless beyond a reasonable doubt. <em>Chapman, supra, </em>386 U.S. at 24, 87 S.Ct. 824.</p>\n<p id=\"b248-10\">Reversed and remanded for a new trial.</p>\n<footnote label=\"1\">\n<p id=\"b246-9\">. The district court, in denying appellant\u2019s motion to suppress, relied upon United States v. Richardson, 388 F.2d 842 (6th Cir. 1968), in which the court declined to characterize an examination by ultraviolet light, similar to the present one, as a search with<page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"183\">*183</page-number>in the meaning of the Fourth Amendment. But the <em>Riohardson </em>court\u2019s opinion is inconclusive. No reason is offered to support its assertion. The court cited only Schmerber v. State of California, 384 U.S. 757, 86 S.Ct. 1826, 16 L.Ed.2d 908 (1966), which seems to offer support for the opposite conclusion, since there the Supreme Court held that a withdrawal of defendant\u2019s blood, for the purposes of examnation, came within the ambit of Fourth Amendment protection. Finally, the court in <em>Richardson </em>chose to rest its holding upon appellant\u2019s consensual waiver of Fourth Amendment rights.</p>\n</footnote>\n<footnote label=\"2\">\n<p id=\"b248-6\">. <em>Barnes </em>held that since the statutory presumption submitted to the jury satisfied both the <em>Leary </em>\u201cmore-likely-than-not\u201d standard as well as the higher \u201cbeyond a reasonable doubt\u201d standard, it accorded with due process. In the present case, however, since the statutory presumption as applied to cocaine in small quantities fails to meet even the <em>Leary </em>standard, we need not go on to examine whether the \u201cbeyond a reasonable doubt\u201d standard is constitutionally required.</p>\n</footnote>\n</opinion>\n</casebody>\n",
