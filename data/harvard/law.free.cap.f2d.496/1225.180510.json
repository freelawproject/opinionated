The opinion of the Customs Court appears at 69 Cust.Ct. 78, C.D. 4377, (1972). The court held that the fish hooks qualified for duty-free entry under item 800.00, <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"1226\">*1226</page-number>TSUS, as returned American products which had not \u201cbeen advanced in value or improved in condition by any process of manufacture or other means while abroad.\u201d</p>\n<p id=\"b1290-4\">After a thorough consideration of appellant\u2019s arguments, we have concluded that we are in full agreement with the opinion of the Customs Court, and we adopt it as our own. The judgment is affirmed.</p>\n</opinion>\n<opinion data-order=\"8\" data-type=\"opinion\" id=\"x999-2\" type=\"dissent\">\n<author id=\"b1290-5\">MILLER, Judge</author>\n<p id=\"AkaS\">(dissenting).</p>\n<p id=\"b1290-6\">I am persuaded that the involved merchandise, having been assembled abroad from bulk into individually-packaged assortments of forty hooks of eight different kinds each to meet the requirements of retail purchasers in this country, was substantially advanced in value and did not, therefore, qualify for classification under Schedule 8, Part 1, Subpart A, item 800.00, which provides as follows:</p>\n<blockquote id=\"b1290-7\">800.00 Products of the United States when returned after having been exported, without having been advanced in value or improved in condition by any process of manufacture or other means while abroad.....................Free</blockquote>\n<p id=\"b1290-8\">I agree with appellant that the holding of the Customs Court effectively reads out of the statute the broad phrase \u201cor other means,\u201d as does the majority here. I further agree that the test under item 800.00 is economic (advanced in value) and not merely physical (improved in condition), and that appellee did not sustain its burden of proving that the involved merchandise was not advanced in value or improved in condition by manufacture or other means. As discussed below, the words \u201cother means\u201d were used by the Congress for the purpose of limiting the duty-free entry of merchandise to compete with domestic industry and labor. Liberalizing the tariff laws by expanding the duty-free provisions is a Congressional prerogative.</p>\n<p id=\"b1290-12\">The phrase \u201cor other means\u201d has been in item 800.00 and its predecessor provisions since the Tariff Act of 1890, enacted by the 51st Congress. It originated during the 50th Congress as an amendment by the Senate Finance Committee to a House-passed bill (H.R. 9051).<footnotemark>1</footnotemark> Under the free list, the House bill had provided:</p>\n<blockquote id=\"b1290-13\">Articles the growth, produce, and manufacturer of the United States, when returned after having been exported, without having been advanced in value by any process of manufacturer or by labor thereon; ....</blockquote>\n<p id=\"b1290-14\">As amended by the Senate Finance Committee, the provision read:</p>\n<blockquote id=\"b1290-15\">Articles the growth, produce, and manufacturer of the United States, when returned after having been exported, without having been advanced in value or improved in condition by any process of manufacture or other means; ....</blockquote>\n<p id=\"b1290-16\">Thus, the Committee <em>added </em>the physical test, \u201cor improved in condition,\u201d and replaced the words \u201cby labor thereon\u201d with \u201cother means,\u201d obviously a broader phrase which would include labor.</p>\n<p id=\"b1290-17\">The Senate passed the amended H.R. 9051 on January 22, 1889. The House failed to act, and the bill died at the end of the 50th Congress, April 2,1889.</p>\n<p id=\"b1290-18\">The 51st Congress commenced December 2, 1889, and the follow-on legislation to the above-referred to H.R. 9051 was introduced by the House Ways and Means Committee as H.R. 9416 on April 16, 1890. The new bill contained the above-quoted provision as amended by the Senate, and there was no attempt to change it as the bill progressed through the two houses and was finally enacted October 1, 1890, as the Tariff Act of 1890.<footnotemark>2</footnotemark></p>\n<p id=\"b1291-4\"><page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"1227\">*1227</page-number>It should be noted that during the 50th Congress, the Senate was in control of those favoring more protection, and the House was in control of those favoring less protection to domestic industry. The protective tariff was a principal issue in the elections of 1888, with those favoring more protection winning control of both the Senate and the House.<footnotemark>3</footnotemark> Thus, the legislative history of the words \u201cother means\u201d makes it clear that protection of domestic industry and labor was intended; also that the test for free entry was not merely the physical \u201cimproved in condition,\u201d but, alternatively, the economic \u201cadvanced in value\u201d as well. Not only is the intent of Congress clear, but the words expressing that intent are clear.</p>\n<p id=\"b1291-5\">Appellee cites Border Brokerage Co. Inc. v. United States, 65 Cust.Ct. 50, C. D. 4052, 314 F.Supp. 788 (1970), relied upon by the Customs Court in its opinion. The case involved 40-pound cartons of tomatoes grown in Florida which were shipped by rail to Canada. There the tomatoes were unloaded, sorted, graded, repacked in 18-pound cartons, and then imported into the United States where they were sold. It seems clear that the repacking was for purposes of <em>wholesale. </em>The Customs Court held that the treatment given the tomatoes in Canada did not advance their value or improve their condition. Whether individual wrapping of the tomatoes would have made a difference in the court\u2019s decision cannot be determined, but it may be significant that the court noted that no cleaning, wiping, or individual wrapping was involved. In any event, the court said:</p>\n<blockquote id=\"b1291-6\">Hence, it would appear from the principles evolved in the Hallauer and Oakville eases, that the test to be applied in item 800.00 cases is whether the merchandise of American origin has itself (apart from its container) been the object of advancement in value or improvement in condition while abroad.</blockquote>\n<p id=\"b1291-12\">The case of Hallauer v. United States, 40 CCPA 197, C.A.D. 518 (1953), involved apples transported in 35-pound boxes to Canada, where they were wiped (to remove an insecticide spray residue), polished, graded and wrapped. They were returned to the United States in 42-pound boxes. Obviously wholesale prices were involved both ways. This court held that the treatment given the apples was sufficient to convert the apples per se into a different unit of merchandise and constituted \u201calterations\u201d within the meaning of paragraph 1615(g) of the Tariff Act of 1930.<footnotemark>4</footnotemark> We are not here concerned with \u201calterations,\u201d so this case is inapposite.</p>\n<p id=\"b1291-13\">The case of United States v. Oakville Company, 402 F.2d 1016, 56 CCPA (1968), involved common pins which were exported in bulk to Canada, along with one-inch wide paper tape rolls 17 or 18 inches in diameter. In Canada the paper tape and the pins were used to ' make new rolls, 5,000 pins to the roll, 5% inches in diameter, wound on wooden spools made in Canada. The new rolls were returned to the' United States for use by one of Oakville\u2019s customers in ticketing machines which attached price tags to garments. The government argued that the pins underwent a manufacturing process in Canada and that what was imported was a different commercial entity from what was exported, citing the case of Winthrop-Stearns, Inc. v. United States, 38 Cust.Ct. 1, C.D. 1835 (1956).<footnotemark>5</footnotemark> This court agreed that <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"1228\">*1228</page-number>what was imported was <em>\u201ca </em>different commercial entity\u201d and said that \u201cfrom the standpoint of commercial reality\u201d the paper tape and the pins had been consumed in making \u201can entirely different article\u201d (\u201cpins-in-rolls\u201d), so that their value as an article of commerce per se had been destroyed, not advanced. It concluded that the \u201cpins-in-rolls\u201d must be assessed with .duty as an entity, but that the paper tape and the pins were entitled to free entry as American goods returned and that their value should be subtracted from the total value of the pins-in-rolls.</p>\n<p id=\"b1292-4\">Unlike the <em>Oakville Company </em>case, we do not have before us a situation in which the exported fish hooks were \u201cconsumed\u201d in making a different article which itself is to be assessed with duty, so a holding here that appellee has not sustained its burden of proving that the fish hooks were not <em>advanced in value </em>or improved in condition by manufacture or <em>other means, </em>as required by the statute, would not be in conflict with out holding there. We are not, of course, bound by the Customs Court\u2019s holding in <em>Winthrop-Stearns </em>or, for that matter, <em>Border Brokerage, </em>but I can see no reason why <em>Winthrop-Stearns </em>would not be citable as precedent for reversal in this case. As appellant points out, some six years after the decision in that case, Congress enacted the Tariff Schedules of the United States. It is presumed that it did so with full knowledge of the decision, and reenactment of the American-goods-returned provision without change is persuasive that Congress intended the <em>Winthrop-Stearns </em>construction of the statute to continue. See Zemel v. Rusk, 381 U.S. 1, 85 S.Ct. 1271, 14 L.Ed.2d 179 (1965).</p>\n<p id=\"b1292-5\">The decision of the Customs Court should be reversed and the ease remanded inasmuch as the court did not consider the question of alternative classification under item 807.00.</p>\n<footnote label=\"1\">\n<p id=\"b1290-9\">.
