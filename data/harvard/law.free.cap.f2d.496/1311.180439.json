(Mobile) appeals the trial court\u2019s decision to grant to defendant-appellee A\u00f1ilas Corporation (A\u00f1ilas) $1250 in costs and attorneys fees incurred in preparing for this lawsuit.</p>\n<p id=\"b1375-29\">Pertinent facts leading up to the lawsuit include the following. In 1970 Mobile leased from A\u00f1ilas a self-contained washing unit manufactured by Power Vac, Inc. (Power Vac).<footnotemark>1</footnotemark> The agreement <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"1312\">*1312</page-number>provided Mobile with a five year lease and the option to purchase the unit when the lease expired. The lease also provided that Mobile would indemnify and hold A\u00f1ilas harmless from any and all liabilities resulting from use of the truck.<footnotemark>2</footnotemark></p>\n<p id=\"b1376-4\">On February 11, 1972, Eugene Gaiters, an employee of Mobile, was driving the washing unit along a four lane highway in Tulsa County, Oklahoma, when another vehicle suddenly swerved into his lane. Gaiters applied the brakes and heard a loud \u201cpop\u201d in the rear of the vehicle; thereafter the vehicle went out of control and turned over, causing extensive injuries to Gaiters and damaging the truck.</p>\n<p id=\"b1376-5\">A suit was filed by Mobile and by Gaiters against A\u00f1ilas and Power Vac. Subsequently plaintiffs obtained a satisfactory offer of settlement from Power Vac and sought an Order of Dismissal with prejudice against both defendants. A\u00f1ilas then filed its application to tax costs and attorneys fees citing as its reasons the above stated indemnification clause and an Oklahoma statute which allows attorneys fees to the prevailing party in certain cases. A\u00f1ilas\u2019 motion was granted.</p>\n<p id=\"b1376-6\">On appeal A\u00f1ilas justifies the costs and attorneys fees on two grounds: (1) Rule 54(d), F.R.Civ.P., and other statutory authority allow costs to the prevailing party; and (2) the lease purchase contract expressly provides indemnification for actions arising out of the use or operation of the washing unit. We do not agree and accordingly reverse.</p>\n<p id=\"b1376-7\">Rule 54(d) <footnotemark>3</footnotemark> and 12 Okla.Stat. \u00a7 936 allow costs to the prevailing party in civil actions. We do not believe, however, that A\u00f1ilas is a \u201cprevailing party\u201d as meant by the statutes. Generally a prevailing party is the party in whose favor judgment is rendered by the district court. S. A. Hirsh Mfg. Co. v. Childs, 157 F.Supp. 183 (W.D.Pa.1957); Nash v. Raun, 67 F.Supp. 212 (W.D.Pa. 1946); 6 Moore\u2019s Federal Practice ft 54.70 [4]. Judgment, however, was not entered in A\u00f1ilas\u2019 favor. Mobile elected to settle with Power Vac rather than go to court against both co-defendants and by no stretch of the imagination can we see where settlement between plaintiff and one co-defendant transforms the other co-defendant into a prevailing party.</p>\n<p id=\"b1376-11\">A\u00f1ilas suggests that where a plaintiff voluntarily dismisses an action the defendant is entitled to recover costs. While this is an accurate statement of law with respect to dismissal of actions without prejudice, the court lacks power to allow costs, barring exceptional circumstances, if the dismissal is with prejudice. Smoot v. Fox, 353 F.2d 830 (6th Cir. 1965), cert. den\u2019d 384 U.S. 909, 86 S.Ct. 1342, 16 L.Ed.2d 361; 9 Wright &amp; Miller, Federal Practice and Procedure, \u00a7 2366. We do not believe A\u00f1ilas has presented any exceptional circumstances warranting allowance of costs. <em>See </em>Lawrence v. Fuld, 32 F.R.D. 329 (D.Md.1963).</p>\n<p id=\"b1376-12\">A\u00f1ilas also relies on the lease-purchase agreement for justifying the trial court decision. Before A\u00f1ilas could rely on this contract provision, however, it must have filed a counterclaim as required by Rule 13(a), F.R.Civ.P. Its failure to follow the mandates of Rule <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"1313\">*1313</page-number>13(a) precludes its reliance on the lease-purchase agreement in the instant action.</p>\n<p id=\"b1377-5\">Because the court had no authority by statute or rule to award A\u00f1ilas costs; because A\u00f1ilas is not a prevailing party; and because A\u00f1ilas did not file a counterclaim before dismissal of the action, we reverse the trial court\u2019s decision.</p>\n<footnote label=\"1\">\n<p id=\"b1375-30\">. The unit consisted of a custom-made washing and cleaning apparatus resting on a two-and-one-half ton truck.</p>\n</footnote>\n<footnote label=\"2\">\n<p id=\"b1376-8\">. Lessee agrees to and does hereby indemnify and hold Lessor harmless of, from and against all claims, costs, expenses, damages and liabilities, including reasonable attorney fees resulting from or pertaining to the use or operation of the property during the term of this agreement and while said property is in possession of the Lessee.</p>\n</footnote>\n<footnote label=\"3\">\n<p id=\"b1376-9\">. Rule 54(d) Costs. Except where express provision therefore is made either in a statute of the United States or in these rules, costs shall be allowed as a matter of course to the prevailing party unless the court otherwise directs; . . .</p>\n<p id=\"b1376-14\">12 O.S. \u00a7 936. In any civil action to recover on an open account, account stated, note, bill, negotiable instrument, or contract relating to the purchase or sale of goods, wares, or merchandise, or for labor or the contract which is subject to the action, the prevailing party shall be allowed a reasonable attorney fee to be set by the court, to be taxed and collected as costs.</p>\n</footnote>\n</opinion>\n</casebody>\n",
