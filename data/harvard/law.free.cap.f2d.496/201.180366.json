Citizens Casualty Company of New York et al., 5th Cir. 1970, 431 F.2d 409, Part I.</p>\n</footnote>\n<opinion data-order=\"9\" data-type=\"opinion\" id=\"x999-2\" type=\"majority\">\n<author id=\"b266-5\">GOLDBERG, Circuit Judge:</author>\n<p id=\"b266-6\">Defendant Hill appeals from his conviction on two counts of transporting, possessing, selling and transferring distilled spirits in containers not having the appropriate revenue stamps, a violation of 26 U.S.C. \u00a7 5205(a)(2). He seeks to have this Court remove the moonshining label attached to his actions by the jury on the basis of six alleged errors in the conduct of the proceedings below. Hill contends that the trial court: (1) prejudiced defendant\u2019s case by remarks made during the course of the trial; (2) inaccurately instructed the jury as to both the nature of the offense and the applicable standard for weighing the evidence; (3) neglected its duty in failing on its own motion to exclude certain hearsay testimony and inflammatory information concerning the accused; (4) improperly permitted the jury to separate during trial recesses; (5) erroneously denied a motion for a directed verdict of acquittal; and (6) abused its discretion in refusing to grant a new trial. We find that these allegations of misconduct and mistake below are without support in either the record of this case or the law of this Circuit, and we affirm.</p>\n<p id=\"b266-7\">Defendant cites nine specific comments or actions by the district judge during the course of the trial that allegedly prejudiced his defense by preventing the full development of the evidence in his favor, materially aiding the prosecution in the presentation of its ease, and indicating to the jury the court\u2019s adverse opinion, on the innocence of the accused. It has been long recognized and frequently reaffirmed that a federal trial judge is not relegated to the position of a mere moderator, but may, by timely interventions, elicit testimony from witnesses, comment on the evidence to the jury, and limit the questioning of counsel. Quercia v. United States, 1933, 289 U.S. 466, 53 S.Ct. 698, 77 L.Ed. 1321; United States v. Jacquillon, 5 Cir. 1972, 469 F.2d 380, cert. denied, 410 U.S. 938, 93 S.Ct. 1400, 35 L.Ed. 2d 604; United States v. DeLaughter, 5 Cir. 1972, 453 F.2d 908, cert. denied, 406 U.S. 932, 92 S.Ct. 1769, 32 L.Ed. 2d 135; Kyle v. United States, 5 Cir. 1968, 402 F.2d 443. In so doing, of course, the judge must adhere to stringent standards of impartiality, Herman v. United States, 5 Cir. 1961, 289 F.2d 362, cert. denied, 368 U.S. 897, 82 S.Ct. 174, 7 L.Ed.2d 93; and this Court will affirm a conviction on the basis of a record disclosing significant judicial participation only when it is convinced that the interventions could not reasonably have led the jury to a predisposition of guilt by improperly confusing the functions of judge and prosecutor. <em>See </em>United States v. Arroyave, 5 Cir. 1973, 477 F.2d 157; United States v. Bays, 5 Cir. 1971, 448 F.2d 977, cert. denied, 405 U.S. 957, 92 S.Ct. 1186, 31 L.Ed.2d 234. We have also noted that,</p>\n<blockquote id=\"b266-10\">\u201c[ajbove all, the trial judge must maintain an attitude of impartiality and avoid giving the impression that he believes the accused is guilty. Otherwise, there is risk of a judge\u2019s usurping the function of the jury because of the weight likely to be placed in his opinion.\u201d</blockquote>\n<p id=\"b266-11\">United States v. Jacquillon, <em>supra, </em>at 387.</p>\n<p id=\"b266-12\">Defendant\u2019s specifications of error, viewed both separately and in the context of the whole record, <em>see </em>United States v. Penner, 5 Cir. 1970, 425 F.2d 729, reveal no such confusion of the roles of judge, jury, and prosecutor. The actions of the trial court challenged here amount to no more than attempts by the presiding judge to expedite the proceedings and to prevent any misunderstanding of a witness\u2019s testimony. While the court\u2019s remarks were at times blunt and, in at least one instance sarcastic, an occasional lapse of patience from the bench will not suffice to overturn a conviction returned after a full and fair presentation of the evidence.</p>\n<p id=\"b267-4\"><page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"203\">*203</page-number>The second contention of error focuses on the court\u2019s charge to the jury. None of the seven instructions now challenged as erroneous and prejudicial provoked any adverse comment from defendant\u2019s counsel at trial, despite the district court\u2019s pointed reminder to counsel that he should make his opinion on the charge known in order to preserve issues for appeal.<footnotemark>1</footnotemark> In light of this acquiescence below, our scrutiny is severely and justifiably circumscribed.</p>\n<blockquote id=\"b267-5\">\u201cThe Court, of course, may notice \u2018plain errors or defects\u2019 affecting substantial rights even though they were not brought to the attention of the trial court. As the plain error rule implies, its application is limited to exceptional situations involving serious deficiencies which affect the fairness, integrity, or public reputation of the judicial proceedings, or which constitute obvious error. This strict standard is necessary in order to promote efficient judicial administration and to prevent parties from gambling for favorable verdicts and then resorting to appeal on errors that might have easily been corrected by objection at trial.\u201d [citations omitted]</blockquote>\n<p id=\"Ai3\">United States v. Jacquillon, <em>supra, </em>at 386.</p>\n<p id=\"b267-6\">Mindful of the Supreme Court\u2019s admonition to appellate tribunals to \u201cguard against the magnification on appeal of instances which were of little importance in their setting,\u201d <footnotemark>2</footnotemark> we have examined the contested instructions not in isolation, but rather as they appear in the course of a lengthy and largely unchallenged charge. <em>See </em>United States v. Cisneros, 5 Cir. 1974, 491 F.2d 1068; United States v. Williams, 5 Cir. 1973, 473 F.2d 507. Our examination of that charge reveals nothing approaching the <em>Jacquillon </em>plain error standard of obvious mistake or serious deficiency affecting the fairness and integrity of a judicial proceeding. Indeed, the only aspect of the instructions that raises even the barest possibility of prejudice to the accused \u2014 the notion that the defendant could be acquitted on the basis of a \u201cprobability of innocence\u201d \u2014 was included in the charge at the request of defendant\u2019s own counsel.</p>\n<p id=\"b267-10\">Appellate counsel concedes that the instances of hearsay and inflammatory testimony, which he considers too numerous to catalogue, passed before the jury without objection by trial counsel. We have nevertheless examined the \u25a0 record for any indication of a violation of the rules of evidence so severe as to constitute plain error and to have deprived defendant of his constitutional right to confront the witnesses against him. <em>See </em>Pointer v. Texas, 1965, 380 U.S. 400, 85 S.Ct. 1065, 13 L.Ed.2d 923; Park v. Huff, 5 Cir. 1974, 493 F.2d 923. The record does not support defendant\u2019s contention of an evidentiary debacle in the district court. The only significant testimony regarding out of court statements involved declarations made by defendant himself. Such admissions pose neither hearsay nor confrontation difficulties. <em>Cf. </em>Nelson v. O\u2019Neil, 1971, 402 U.S. 622, 91 S.Ct. 1723, 29 L.Ed.2d 222; Bruton v. United States, 1968, 391 U.S. 123, 88 S.Ct. 1620, 20 L.Ed.2d 476.</p>\n<p id=\"b267-11\">Defendant\u2019s fourth, fifth, and sixth points of error are frivolous and can be quickly dispatched. The propriety of sequestering the jury is a matter within the sound discretion of the trial court; and the exercise of that discretion will result in reversal only upon a showing of actual prejudice to the accused. United States v. Harris, 5 Cir. 1972, 458 F.2d 670; Tyler v. United States, 5 Cir. 1968, 397 F.2d 565, cert. denied, 394 U.S. 917, 89 S.Ct. 1187, 22 L.Ed.2d 450; Grant v. United States, 5 Cir. 1966, 368 F.2d 658. Defendant has at no point attempted to demonstrate <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"204\">*204</page-number>prejudice, either to the district court or to this Court on appeal.</p>\n<p id=\"b268-4\">The arguments of insufficient evidence and improper denial of a new trial rest largely on defendant\u2019s contention that the testimony of a government informer was simply too \u201cincredible\u201d to be believed, due in part to the witness\u2019s obvious bias and the existence of an outstanding state felony indictment against her. However, defendant does not allege that any undisclosed deal had been made between the witness and government officials promising lenient treatment in return for favorable testimony, <em>see </em>Giglio v. United States, 1972, 405 U.S. 150, 92 S.Ct. 763, 31 L.Ed.2d 104; and the information relied on here to attack credibility was made known to the jury. We have no authority to substitute our own assessment of the truthfulness of the witness for the final determination reached by that jury after a full disclosure. Glasser v. United States, 1942, 315 U.S. 60, 80, 62 S.Ct. 457, 86 L.Ed. 680.</p>\n<p id=\"b268-5\">Every round of defendant\u2019s attack on the judgment below has fallen wide of the mark. The conviction is affirmed.</p>\n<p id=\"b268-6\">Affirmed.</p>\n<footnote label=\"1\">\n<p id=\"b267-7\">. During the colloquy at the bench prior to the delivery of the charge, the judge admonished defendant\u2019s counsel that, \u201c[n]ow is the time you are talking to the Fifth Circuit, so speak up.\u201d</p>\n</footnote>\n<footnote label=\"2\">\n<p id=\"b267-12\">.
