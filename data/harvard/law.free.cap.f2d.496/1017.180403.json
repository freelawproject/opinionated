The complaint seeks to enjoin the construction of an expressway which would pass through parklands in the City of San Antonio, Texas. Plaintiffs are named individual members of the San Antonio Conservation Society, and defendants are The Texas Highway Department, an administrative agency of the State of Texas, acting by and through the Texas Highway Commission, consisting of DeWitt C. Greer, Herbert C. Petry, Jr., and Garret Morris, and the State Highway Engineer, J. C. Dingwall, termed \u201cState defendants\u201d; and The Federal Department of Transportation, an administrative agency of the United States of America, acting by and through John A. Volpe, Secretary of Transportation; F. C. Turner, Administrator, Federal Highway Administration; R. R. Bartlesmeyer, Director, Bureau of Public Roads; A. C. Taylor, Regional Administrator, Federal Highway Administration ; and J. F. Cary, Division Engineer, Bureau of Public Roads, termed \u201cfederal defendants.\u201d <footnotemark>1</footnotemark></p>\n<p id=\"b1083-18\">The question for decision is whether the congressional enactment of section 154 of the Federal-Aid Highway Act of 1973, severing all federal connection with the San Antonio North Expressway, removes that project from the necessity for compliance with the provisions of the National Environmental Policy Act (NEPA) (42 U.S.C. \u00a7 4331 et seq.)<footnotemark>2</footnotemark> and section 4(f) of the Depart<page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"1020\">*1020</page-number>ment of Transportation Act (49 U.S.C. \u00a7 1653(f)).<footnotemark>3</footnotemark></p>\n<p id=\"b1084-4\">Our prior decision (446 F.2d 1013 (1971)) reversed a summary judgment in favor of defendants and held that there had been a failure to comply with the provisions of NEPA and section 4(f) before proceeding with construction of the Expressway. We remanded the case with directions to the district court that it be held until 'the Secretary of Transportation had complied with his statutory responsibilities after which the district court was to conduct a full review of the matter. In the meanwhile, we ordered that \u201c[c] (instruction shall not proceed until there has been full compliance with the law.\u201d <em>Id., </em>at 1029.</p>\n<p id=\"b1084-5\">The San Antonio North Expressway has been projected since 1959. The disputed segment is approximately six miles long, running about north and south through the middle of the City of San Antonio, and extends between Interstate Loop 410 and Interstate Highway 35. The controversy arises out of the fact that it will traverse portions of the Braekenridge-Olmos Basin Parklands. Its proponents stress the imperative need to solve serious traffic problems of the city; its opponents do not wish it to go through the beautiful Parklands in mid San Antonio. Some time after our initial decision in this case, Congress enacted the Federal-Aid Highway Act of 1973. Section 154 of that Act is directly applicable to the Expressway here, and reads in full as follows:</p>\n<blockquote id=\"b1084-12\">(f) It is hereby declared to be the national policy that special effort should be made to preserve the natural beauty of the countryside and public park and recreation lands, wildlife and waterfowl refuges, and historic sites. The Secretary of Transportation shall cooperate and consult with the Secretaries of the Interior, Housing and Urban Development, and Agriculture, and with the States in developing transportation plans and programs that include measures to maintain or enhance the natural beauty of the lands traversed. After August 23, 1968, the Secretary shall not approve any program or project which requires the use of any publicly owned land from a public park, recreation area, or wildlife and waterfowl refuge of national, State, or local significance as determined by the Federal, State, or local officials having jurisdiction thereof, or any land from an historic site of national, State, or local significance as so determined by such officials unless (1) there is no feasible and prudent alternative to the use of such land, and (2) such program includes all possible planning to minimize harm to such park, recreational area, wildlife and waterfowl refuge, or historic site resulting from such use.</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b1084-14\">Sec. 154. (a) Notwithstanding any other provisions of Federal law or any court decision to the contrary, the contractual relationship between the Federal and State Governments shall be ended with respect to all portions of the San Antonio North Expressway between Interstate Highway 35 and Interstate Loop 410, and the expressway shall cease to be a Federal-aid project.</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b1084-16\">(b) The amount of all Federal-aid highway funds paid on account of sections of the San Antonio North Expressway in Bexar County, Texas (Federal-aid projects numbered U 244(7), U 244(10), UG 244(9), U 244(8), and U 244(11)), shall be repaid to the Treasurer of the United States and the amount so repaid shall be deposited to the credit of the appropriation for \u201cFederal-Aid Highways (Trust Fund)\u201d. At the time of such repayment the Federal-aid projects with respect to which funds have been repaid and any other Federal-aid projects located on such expressway and programed for expenditure on such project, if any, such be canceled and withdrawn from the Federal-aid <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"1021\">*1021</page-number>highway program. Any amount so repaid, together with the unpaid balance of any amount programed for expenditure on any such project shall be credited to the unprogramed balance of Federal-aid highway funds of the same class last apportioned to the States, respectively. The amount so credited shall be available for expenditure in accordance with the provisions of title 23, United States Code, as amended.</blockquote>\n<p id=\"b1085-4\">It is undisputed that in conformity with section 154 the State of Texas has returned to the Federal Government all federal-aid funds which it received on account of the Expressway and that it will receive no other federal funds in the future to aid in its construction. All funds received have been restored to the Federal Government and reapportioned among the States. By congressional enactment the Expressway is now entirely a state-financed project.</p>\n<p id=\"b1085-5\">Upon the passage of section 154 the Federal Government and the State of Texas both moved the district court to dismiss plaintiffs\u2019 suit on the ground that removal of all federal funding by Congress exempted the project from compliance with the environmental provisions of NEPA and section 4(f). Plaintiffs contended, however, that passage of section 154 did not exempt the Expressway from the requirement that state and federal officials comply with federal environmental statutes specifically designed to protect parklands, especially NEPA and section 4(f). Plaintiffs argued that these statutory requirements are still applicable (1) because the Expressway would traverse an area in which U. S. Army Corps of Engineers\u2019 approval would be required, thus constituting a \u201cmajor federal action\u201d under 42 U.S.C. \u00a7 4332(2) (C) and necessitating an environmental impact statement; (2) because the Expressway was only a small portion of a larger federal-aid network and inextricably related thereto; (3) because it would cross the San Antonio River said to be navigable and for which a U. S. Coast Guard permit would be required, another \u201cmajor federal action\u201d; and (4) if section 154 did exempt the project, it violated the due process clause of the U. S. Constitution.</p>\n<p id=\"b1085-9\">The district court ruled adversely to the plaintiffs on all of these issues and held that the San Antonio North Expressway was exempt from the requirements of the federal environmental laws by virtue of the congressional enactment of section 154, which was not unconstitutional. Summary judgment was granted in favor of defendants and plaintiffs bring this appeal. A large volume of evidence, affidavits, depositions, and exhibits was filed by the parties in connection with the motions, and there does not appear to be any serious dispute as to the facts. It is the law as to which the parties have stressed their principal arguments and on which they differ.</p>\n<p id=\"b1085-10\">We stayed the district court order pending consideration of this appeal.</p>\n<p id=\"b1085-11\">I.</p>\n<p id=\"b1085-12\">Plaintiffs contend that section 154 does not in its terms specifically exempt the North Expressway from NEPA, section 4(f) or any other federal law, and the fact that the North Expressway is now exclusively a Texas state highway project is not dispositive of the environmental issues. They argue that if Congress intended this result it should have expressly stated it in section 154.</p>\n<p id=\"b1085-13\">Following this premise the plaintiffs urge that the Expressway will pass through the San Antonio Channel Improvement Project over which the Army Corps of Engineers has jurisdiction, such as, for example, the Olmos Dam and Reservoir situated in the Olmos Basin Parklands which they aver are portions of the Channel Improvement Project.<footnotemark>4</footnotemark> Plaintiffs contend that the <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"1022\">*1022</page-number>State Highway Department must obtain the Army Corps\u2019 approval for the Expressway to cross the San Antonio River at Josephine Street and also to traverse the Olmos Dam and Reservoir area. They aver that the prior 1968 approval thereof by the Army Corps is outdated because there have been material changes in the design of the Expressway since that time. Finally they' contend that the Army Corps' approval will constitute a \u201cmajor federal action\u201d and thereby trigger the provisions of NEPA relative to furnishing an environmental impact statement. The defendants, Federal and State Governments, respond that the plain language of section 154 as well as the legislative history make it clear that Congress intended to exempt the North Expressway from the environmental requirements of federal law. They contend that Army Corps\u2019 approval of the project insofar as the river crossing at Josephine Street and traversing the Olmos Dam and Reservoir are concerned is not required by statute, regulation, or otherwise and that the Corps has no authority to approve or disapprove the Expressway.</p>\n<p id=\"b1086-11\">We agree with defendants. Section 154(a) clearly states that <em>\u201cNotwithstanding any other provisions of Federal law </em>or any court decision to the contrary, the contractual relationship between the Federal and State Governments shall be ended . . . and the expressway shall cease to be a Federal-aid project.\u201d (Emphasis added.) If Congress had not intended to exempt the Expressway from the environmental statutes, there would have been no purpose in passing the legislation. We cannot believe that Congress intended a vain and useless act. Any doubt about the matter, however, is fully resolved by the legislative history which shows without question that Congress drew the bill with the evident purpose of exempting the Expressway from the provisions of federal environmental laws including NEPA and section 4(f).<footnotemark>5</footnotemark> The debates in the Senate and House disclose this unmistakably, as do the reports of the Senate and House Committees.<footnotemark>6</footnotemark> Federal <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"1023\">*1023</page-number>control and involvement thus came to an end with enactment of section 154.<footnotemark>7</footnotemark></p>\n<p id=\"b1087-4\">Nor was approval of the Expressway by the Army Corps of Engineers necessary so as to constitute a \u201cmajor federal action\u201d and trigger the provisions of NEPA relative to the requirement of an environmental impact statement before the Expressway can proceed. The Olmos Dam and Reservoir areas and the Josephine Street crossing area are not within Corps jurisdiction or authority. No rights of way have been acquired in the area.<footnotemark>8</footnotemark> As the Corps\u2019 witness testified, it would not be able to approve the Expressway plans because there is no Corps project there at the moment.<footnotemark>9</footnotemark> The Corps\u2019 opinion was sought by the Texas Highway Department as to whether the project would cause any adverse effect on flood control, and the state was informed that there was no objection though it was not something within the right of the Corps, to approve or disapprove. It does not appear that there is any legal require<page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"1024\">*1024</page-number>ment that the state obtain Corps\u2019 approval.</p>\n<p id=\"b1088-4\">Thus this case differs from those cited by plaintiffs where federal official approval was necessary, being required by statute, such as Citizens Committee for Hudson Valley, S.D.N.Y.1969, 302 F.Supp. 1083, aff\u2019d 2 Cir., 425 F.2d 97, cert. denied, 400 U.S. 949, 91 S.Ct. 237, 27 L.Ed.2d 256 (1970), and Zabel v. Tabb, 5 Cir., 1970, 430 F.2d 199, cert. denied, 401 U.S. 910, 91 S.Ct. 873, 27 L.Ed.2d 808 (1971), where Army Corps of Engineers\u2019 approval was statutorily required; also, as in Davis v. Morton, 10 Cir., 1972, 469 F.2d 593, where the Secretary of the Interior was required by statute to ratify or reject leases on Indian reservations. In those cases the Federal Government\u2019s role was one of control \u2014 or primary jurisdiction \u2014 unlike the present case. We find no merit, therefore, in this contention of plaintiffs.</p>\n<p id=\"b1088-5\">II.</p>\n<p id=\"b1088-6\">Plaintiffs\u2019 second contention is that the Expressway is only a small portion of a larger federal-aid highway network and that even though this segment is to be constructed exclusively with state funds, NEPA must still be complied with by the state. Plaintiffs contend that practically every vehicle using the Expressway will enter or exit from the federal-aid route. Therefore, they argue that the North Expressway is basically a part of one federal-aid highway. Nevertheless, we cannot ignore the fact that Congress, by section 154, specifically determined that the North Expressway was not to be a federal project. The court below also held that the North Expressway has an independent utility of its own. The Federal Government argues that the congressional enactment of section 154 answers and disposes of this issue since there has now been an express congressional determination that the North Expressway is not a part of a larger federal project. It is true that the Expressway connects with other federal interstate highways at the north and south ends thereof, but defendants point out that virtually every road in the country crosses or interchanges with federal-aid highways, and that there are many state-constructed roads which do not form a part of the federal network. The independent utility of the Expressway is found in its connection of downtown San Antonio with the airport and in its primary purpose to relieve the serious traffic problem in central San Antonio. Accordingly, we hold that the Expressway is properly considered independently of the interstate routes with which it connects.</p>\n<p id=\"b1088-9\">We approve, therefore, the conclusion of the district court (Judge Roberts), well expressed in this regard as follows:</p>\n<blockquote id=\"A6f\">While the North Expressway will, coincidentally, provide a link in the interstate highway system in San Antonio, this is not to be its major function. Indeed, a primary reason for the perseverance of the State in its efforts to build the North Expressway is the interest the people of San Antonio have in the completion of this project, an interest which derives not from the coincidental function of the North Expressway as a link in the interstate highway system, but rather from the perceived need for the North Expressway as a major artery of intra-urban transportation. Thus, the North Expressway has an \u201cindependent utility of its own,\u201d Id., which justifies its consideration separately from surrounding projects for purposes of NEPA. The undisputed facts are that this project is to be financed with non-federal funds, designed and built without federal approval or authorization, and to serve primarily local needs. We cannot conceive this project to be a \u201cmajor Federal action\u201d within the contemplation of 42 U.S.C. \u00a7 4332(2) (C). We conclude, therefore, that no environmental impact statement is necessitated by the relationship of the North Expressway to the interstate highway system.</blockquote>\n<p id=\"b1089-3\"><page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"1025\">*1025</page-number>III.</p>\n<p id=\"b1089-4\">The issue posed by plaintiffs on the navigability <em>vel non </em>of the San Antonio River is now moot. The Army Corps of Engineers made its determination on March 8, 1974 in which it concluded that the San Antonio River at the points involved in this ease should not be regarded as a navigable water of the United States. Plaintiffs' contention that U. S. Coast Guard approval is required for a bridge to cross the river must, therefore, fail.</p>\n<p id=\"b1089-5\">IV.</p>\n<p id=\"b1089-6\">Plaintiffs finally contend that if Congress\u2019 enactment of section 154 did exempt the North Expressway such action violates the due process clause of the U. S. Constitution by arbitrarily discriminating against plaintiffs and depriving them of rights under federal environmental statutes. They argue that such fundamental federal rights are available to all other citizens in the nation in similar circumstances and that Congress has without any justification deprived them of such rights. They aver that there is no basis for treating the Expressway any differently \u201cfrom any other federal-aid highway that threatens urban parklands.\u201d (Appellants\u2019 brief, p. 40.)</p>\n<p id=\"b1089-7\">The short answer to this contention is that by virtue of section 154 the North Expressway is no longer a federal-aid highway and that the same Congress which enacted the environmental statutes to which plaintiffs refer, concluded to exempt this segment of highway from these laws. The federal-aid highway program was established by Congress and there is no reason apparent why it cannot decide which roads of the nation shall be included in the system. The environmental statutes were designed to apply to federal projects. The Expressway is now a state highway, not a federal highway. Its former federal status has been terminated by act of Congress. Congress having spoken in the matter, we see no reason to attempt to override the solemn expression of its will found in the enactment of section 154.</p>\n<p id=\"b1089-12\">V.</p>\n<p id=\"b1089-13\">Plaintiffs have also sought an award of attorneys\u2019 fees in this case. They were successful in reversing the judgment of the district court when we first considered the case on appeal and remanded it. After passage of the Federal Aid Highway Act of 1973, they have been unsuccessful both in the lower court and in this court by our decision herein. They request, however, as a minimum that they be awarded attorneys\u2019 fees through the first appeal. Obviously such an award would be substantial, considering the circumstances of this litigation.</p>\n<p id=\"b1089-14\">They seek such an award against the state defendants. The Texas Highway Department, an administrative agency of the State of Texas, acting by and through the Texas Highway Commission, consisting of DeWitt C. Greer, Herbert C. Petry, Jr., and Garret Morris, and the State Highway Engineer, J. C. Dingwall. It is conceded that the federal defendants are immunized from an award of attorneys\u2019 fees by provisions of 28 U.S.C. \u00a7 2412.<footnotemark>10</footnotemark></p>\n<p id=\"b1089-15\">The claim for attorneys\u2019 fees is asserted under the so-called \u201cprivate attorney general\u201d theory in that plaintiffs contend they were effectuating important congressional policy by prosecuting this suit.<footnotemark>11</footnotemark> Plaintiffs do not contend that their efforts in this environmental case have been made inordinately difficult by actions of defendants taken in <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"1026\">*1026</page-number>bad faith or for oppressive reasons. There is, accordingly, no indication of unreasonable or obdurate obstinacy or vexatious or groundless conduct.</p>\n<p id=\"b1090-4\"> The state defendants respond that sovereign immunity of the State of Texas by virtue of the Eleventh Amendment to the Constitution has also immunized them from an award of attorneys\u2019 fees. The recent case of Edelman v. Jordan, 415 U.S. 651, 94 S.Ct. 1347, 39 L.Ed.2d 662, decided by the Supreme Court on March 25, 1974, is cited by the state defendants in support of this contention. It is apparent that any award for attorneys\u2019 fees must be paid from the general revenues of the State of Texas. Under the <em>Edelman </em>rationale \u201cthe rule has evolved that a suit by private parties seeking to impose a liability which must be paid from public funds in the state treasury is barred by the Eleventh Amendment.\u201d<footnotemark>12</footnotemark> <em>Edelman, supra, </em>415 U.S. at 663, 94 S.Ct. at 1356. Cases in which attorneys\u2019 fees were awarded because of bad faith or obdurate obstinacy, or under the private attorney general theory against non-state defendants, are clearly inapposite. The claim for attorneys\u2019 fees, even if limited to services through the first appeal of this case, is, therefore, barred.</p>\n<p id=\"b1090-5\">Conclusion</p>\n<p id=\"b1090-6\">This controversy has now \u201cbeen resolved in the Halls of Congress, which is the proper place in our system of Government for priority decisions to be made.\u201d 446 F.2d at 1024. We therefore defer to the will of Congress and give effect to its solemn enactment. Here the litigation should end.</p>\n<p id=\"b1090-7\">Affirmed.</p>\n<footnote label=\"1\">\n<p id=\"b1083-10\">.

While congressional termination of Federal involvement in such projects is not unprecedented, the Committee recognizes that this is an unusual action and believes it is warranted only because of unusual circumstances.</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b1086-9\">The project involves a non-interstate urban expressway located wholly within the limits of the City of San Antonio which was planned and requested by that city in 1959. The State obtained initial route approval from the Federal Highway Administrator, purchased all rights-of-way, and completed all relocation with approximately $7 million in State and local funds prior to changes in Federal law which later involved it in legal controversy.</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b1086-14\">The Secretary approved the letting of construction contracts prior to recent Federal court decisions defining the standard by which the administrative approval was to be reviewed.
