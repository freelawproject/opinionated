The schedules annexed to the motions are not shown, as such, in the transcript, but a separate schedule of cases is attached to the order and is certified by the clerk of the Customs Court to be identical to that recited as annexed to the motion. Each transcript also includes a certificate of similarity from the clerk of the Customs Court, stating that the order of dismissal in the captioned action is. typical of the other orders of dismissal entered in all actions covered by the appeal.</p>\n<p id=\"b1298-10\">The essential facts and issues involved herein are identical to those in the consolidated appeals in Reynolds Trading Corp. et al. v.
