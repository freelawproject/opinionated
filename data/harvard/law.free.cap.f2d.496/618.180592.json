The opinion is reported at 179 U.S.P.Q. 607 (1973).</p>\n<p id=\"b682-24\">Appellant, Alberto-Culver, claims here, as it did in its counterclaim below, that the La Maur \u201cStyle\u201d trademark should be cancelled and that La Maur is in violation of the antitrust laws. AlbertoCulver also claims that the trial court erred in several other aspects, contending primarily that the record in the case shows no evidence of any likelihood of confusion between the La Maur and Alberto-Culver marks. According to Alberto-Culver, the marks are not similar in sound, appearance or meaning; further, the trial court did not consider this fact and therefore its finding of likelihood of confusion is clearly erroneous.</p>\n<p id=\"b682-25\">After careful consideration of the entire record we are satisfied that the district court\u2019s determination that the \u201crequisite \u2018likelihood of confusion\u2019 exists\u201d, is based on findings that are not clearly erroneous and that no error of law appears.</p>\n<p id=\"b682-26\">Implicit throughout the trial court\u2019s exhaustive examination of the facts and law is the overriding consideration of trademark similarity. The findings of the district court are amply supported by the record. Further amplification of the trial court\u2019s opinion would serve no useful purpose.</p>\n<p id=\"b682-27\">Accordingly we affirm on the basis of the trial court\u2019s extensive and well-reasoned opinion.</p>\n<footnote label=\"**\">\n<p id=\"b682-28\"> Honorable Earl Larson.</p>\n</footnote>\n</opinion>\n</casebody>\n",
