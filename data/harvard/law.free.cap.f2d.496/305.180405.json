Buckley, Jr. and M. Stanton Evans] continue to be members of [appellant union, American Federation of Television and Radio Artists], pay dues to [appellant union] and/or comply with [appellant union\u2019s] orders and regulations, as a condition of\u201d appearing on radio or television in their roles as paid commentators on public affairs is \u201cvoid and of no effect.\u201d Insofar as the appellees\u2019 responsibility to tender periodic dues to the uni\u00f3n is nullified by the judgment below, we reverse on the merits. Moreover, inasmuch as we hold that the district court was without jurisdiction to adjudicate the other issues raised by the appellees\u2019 complaints, which pertained to compulsory union membership and to compulsory compliance with union orders and regulations, we also reverse the remaining portions of the district court\u2019s judgment.</p>\n<p id=\"b371-16\">With great care the district court accurately set forth the specific facts and circumstances from which this litigation arose. See 354 F.Supp. at 826-836. No useful purpose would be served by a detailed repetition of the presentation so articulately and comprehensively set forth in the opinion below. Moreover, the relative narrowness of the decision we reach today renders immaterial for our purposes much of the factual background developed by the district court. We shall therefore confine our discussion of the facts to those which are within the ambit of the limited role we think a federal court can play in this dispute at the present time.</p>\n<p id=\"b372-3\"><page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"308\">*308</page-number>Both appellees are well-known articulate exponents of a \u201cconservative\u201d political philosophy. They are engaged in a plethora of activities, amongst which are regular appearances on radio and television. Mr. Buckley is the host of his own television program, \u201cFiring Line,\u201d in which he usually engages in spirited argument guest spokesmen of \u201cliberal\u201d persuasion. Mr. Evans appears as a participant on the CBS radio series \u201cSpectrum,\u201d a program in which on a regular basis a number of spokesmen for differing political and social philosophies express their opinions on topics of their own choosing.</p>\n<p id=\"b372-4\">The employing parties with whom Buckley and Evans negotiated their contracts of employment have collective bargaining agreements with AFTRA. These latter agreements, by incorporation of the union\u2019s \u201cCode of Fair Practice,\u201d obligate the employers to employ only members of AFTRA or persons who become members of AFTRA within thirty days after the commencement of the employment relationship. This \u201cunion shop\u201d provision is authorized, but not required, by Section 8(a)(3) of the National Labor Relations Act (\u201cNLRA\u201d), 29 U.S.C. \u00a7 158(a)(3), which reads:</p>\n<blockquote id=\"b372-5\">(a) It shall be an unfair labor practice for an employer \u2014 \u25a0</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b372-6\">(3) by discrimination in regard to hire or tenure of employment or any term or condition of employment to encourage or discourage membership in any labor organization : <em>Provided, </em>That nothing in this Act, or in any other statute of the United States, shall preclude an - employer from making an agreement with a labor organization (not established, maintained, or assisted by any action defined in section 8(a) of this Act as an unfair labor practice) to require as a condition of employment membership therein on or after the thirtieth day following the beginning of such employment or the effective date of such agreement, whichever is the later. * * -x- <em>Provided further, </em>That no employer shall justify any discrimination against an employee for non-membership in a labor organization (A) if he has reasonable grounds for believing that such membership was not available to the employee on the same terms and conditions generally applicable to other members, or (B) if he has reasonable grounds for believing that membership was denied or terminated for reasons other than the failure of the employee to tender the periodic dues and the initiation fees uniformly required as a condition of acquiring or retaining membership;</blockquote>\n<p id=\"b372-10\">In addition, the union\u2019s constitution purports to impose upon its members responsibilities to the union in excess of those contemplated by \u00a7 8(a)(3). For example, Article XVIII, Sec. 1 of the AFTRA Constitution describes the punishments to which a union member is subject for failure to fulfill those responsibilities :</p>\n<blockquote id=\"b372-11\">Any member who shall be guilty of an act, omission, or conduct which in the opinion of the Board is prejudicial to the welfare of the Association, or of any of its Locals, or of any of its members, as such, or any member who shall fail to observe any of the requirements of the Constitution, or of any By-Laws, rules, regulations or orders lawfully issued by the Association, any Local or any duly authorized committee or agent of said Association or Local, or any member who shall in any way be indebted to the Association or any Local thereof, may, in the discretion <em>of </em>the Board, be either fined, censured, suspended or expelled from membership. .</blockquote>\n<p id=\"b372-12\">In their complaints in the district court the appellees challenged alleged requirements allegedly imposed upon them, that they be members of the union, that they pay dues to the union, and that they comply with all union orders and regulations. They claimed that these requirements which they allege were sought to be imposed upon them by the union constituted unreasonable re<page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"309\">*309</page-number>straints on the right of free speech and deprived them of their property without due process of law. The imposition of these requirements was asserted to have been \u201caccomplished by the defendant AFTRA acting under the authority of the National Labor Relations Act.\u201d</p>\n<p id=\"b373-5\">As we have already stated, the expansive relief granted by the district court absolved appellees from union membership, from paying dues, and from complying with union regulations. For reasons that appear <em>infra </em>we hold that as to the issues of compulsory membership and compliance with union regulations, the National Labor Relations Board (\u201cNLRB\u201d) had primary jurisdiction under the preemption principle of San Diego Building Trades Council v. Garmon, 359 U.S. 236, 245, 79 S.Ct. 773, 3 L.Ed.2d 775 (1959). Thus we hold that the federal district court exceeded its power in deciding these two issues, and we do not reach the merits with respect to them. Regarding the dues requirement, however, we do reach the merits and hold, contrary to the result reached by the district court, that this requirement does not abridge appellees\u2019 first amendment right of free speech.</p>\n<p id=\"b373-6\"> It is elementary constitutional doctrine that the first amendment only restrains action undertaken by the Government. Railway Employes\u2019 Dep\u2019t v. Hanson, 351 U.S. 225, 76 S.Ct. 714, 100 L.Ed. 1112 (1956); Linscott v. Millers Falls Co., 440 F.2d 14 (1 Cir.), cert. denied, 404 U.S. 872, 92 S.Ct. 77, 30 L.Ed.2d 116 (1971). There is, however, a crucial corollary to this rudimentary tenet. When private action becomes imbued with a governmental character, or when the Government significantly insinuates itself into the operative activities of private parties, then action by private parties may be regarded as \u201cstate action\u201d and, if so, will be subject to all the constitutional limitations on governmental action. Evans v. Newton, 382 U.S. 296, 299, 86 S.Ct. 486, 15 L.Ed.2d 373 (1966); Burton v. Wilmington Parking Authority, 365 U.S. 715, 722, 81 S.Ct. 856, 6 L.Ed.2d 45 (1961). Here it is alleged that the requirement found in the AFTRA Code of Fair Practice that dues be paid is \u201caccomplished by the defendant AFTRA acting under the authority of the National Labor Relations Act.\u201d It is true that \u00a7 8(a)(3) expressly authorizes union shop agreements which may require that employees pay union dues. The section also specifically permits the discharge of an employee who fails to comply with such a dues requirement. Appellees contend that this congressional authorization makes a union shop provision contained in a collective bargaining agreement negotiated between private parties \u201cstate action.\u201d In support of this contention, appellees rely primarily on Railway Employes\u2019 Dep\u2019t v. Hanson, supra, and Linscott v. Millers Falls Co., <em>supra. </em>In Railway Employes\u2019 Dep\u2019t, the Supreme Court held that the Railway Labor Act provision comparable to \u00a7 8(a)(3) of the National Labor Relations Act transmutes otherwise private union shop agreements into \u201cgovernmental action.\u201d The Railway Labor Act, however, explicitly provides that union shops are permissible despite any state law that would otherwise prohibit them, whereas Section 14 of the NLRA, on the other hand, declares that a state \u201cright to work\u201d law forbidding union shops will not be superseded by \u00a7 8(a)(3). However, the First Circuit in Linscott v. Millers Falls Co., <em>supra, </em>quoting Railway Employes\u2019 Dep\u2019t v. Hanson, <em>supra </em>at 232, ascribed little significance to this distinction between the two labor statutes, and found that a union shop agreement under the NLRA constituted government action because \u201cthe federal statute is the source of the power and authority by which any private rights are lost or sacrificed.\u201d 440 F.2d at 16. Appellees would have us adopt this reasoning, and after first holding that the union shop agreement is subject to constitutional scrutiny, then proceed to rule in their <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"310\">*310</page-number>favor by holding that the dues requirement violates the first amendment.<footnotemark>1</footnotemark></p>\n<p id=\"b374-4\">In order to establish jurisdiction to reach the merits of this first amendment claim, it might at first blush appear we must resolve the \u201cgovernment action\u201d issue. But this is not necessarily so.</p>\n<p id=\"b374-5\">The line between a jurisdictional issue unrelated to the merits of an action and one which depends upon adjudication of the ultimate merits of a case is sometimes a fine line. In fact, many jurisdictional problems cannot be unqualifiedly inserted into one category or the other. It often is difficult to resolve jurisdictional issues without, in effect, reaching determinations on the merits. See, e. g., Comment, 47 N.Y.U.L.Rev. 349, 354 (1972). In Bell v. Hood, 327 U.S. 678, 66 S.Ct. 773, 90 L.Ed. 939 (1946), the Supreme Court sought to alleviate some of these conceptual incongruities by developing a practical approach. This approach allows a federal court to assume jurisdiction over an action alleging violation of the U.S. Constitution if satisfied by an initial cursory examination that there is, on the merits, a justiciable issue. In <em>Bell </em>the plaintiffs sought money damages from the defendants, Federal Bureau of Investigation agents, who were alleged to have improperly searched the plaintiffs\u2019 premises and to have falsely imprisoned the plaintiffs in derogation of their fourth and fifth amendment rights. The defendants argued that the fourth and fifth amendments represent proscriptions \u201cagainst the federal government as a government\u201d and could not support a damage suit against particular government employees for allegedly violating those proscriptions. The Court approached the issue of whether such a suit, bottomed upon alleged violations of constitutional limitations, was maintainable \u2014 an issue somewhat analogous to the issue of whether a suit alleging violation of the first amendment can be maintained against the private party, AFTRA, here. In <em>Bell </em>the Court held that, in the circumstances there alleged, federal jurisdiction to adjudicate the plaintiffs\u2019 claims on the merits could be defeated <em>only </em>by a showing that an alleged violation of the Constitution is really immaterial to the practical resolution of the litigation and was raised solely for the purpose of achieving jurisdiction, or by a showing that the claim is wholly insubstantial and frivolous. <em>Id. </em>at 682-683.</p>\n<p id=\"b374-8\">So here, when we apply the practical test of <em>Bell, </em>we conclude, without having to decide the issue of whether AFTRA\u2019s dues requirement is \u201cgovernment action,\u201d that the district court had jurisdiction to adjudicate the appellees\u2019 claims that AFTRA\u2019s dues requirement impinges upon appellees\u2019 first amendment rights. First of all, the constitutional claim is neither \u201cimmaterial\u201d nor presented \u201csolely for the purpose of obtaining jurisdiction.\u201d More importantly, although the government action aspect of the claim may be a close question, the claim is not an insubstantial or frivolous one. Indeed, the contrary is true. For instance, an examination of the contrasting views expressed in the majority and concurring opinions in Linscott v. Millers Falls Co., <em>supra, </em>convinces us that the claim appellees here assert under the Constitution is not made insubstantial and frivolous because of its \u201cgovernment action\u201d aspect.</p>\n<p id=\"b374-9\">Having established that we have jurisdiction to decide whether AFTRA\u2019s requirement that appellees pay its pre- \u25a0 scribed dues violates appellees\u2019 first amendment rights, we hold there is no violation. In so deciding, we do not need to reach the issue of whether government action is involved. We conclude that even if it were, which we do not intimate, the dues requirement is not constitutionally infirm.</p>\n<p id=\"b375-3\"><page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"311\">*311</page-number>Acts of speech and of expression, although protected by the first amendment, are not so exalted that they can never be, even indirectly, obstructed. Cox v. New Hampshire, 312 U.S. 569, 61 S.Ct. 762, 85 L.Ed. 1049 (1941). Indeed, even with reference to freedom of the press, the Supreme Court has recently reaffirmed what has long been understood to be the law: \u201c[Otherwise valid laws serving substantial public interests may be enforced against the press as against others, despite the possible burden that may be imposed.\u201d Branzburg v. Hayes, 408 U.S. 665, 682-683, 92 S.Ct. 2646, 2657, 33 L.Ed.2d 626 (1972). More specifically, where there is a proper governmental purpose for imposing a restraint and where the restraint is imposed so as not to \u201cunwarrantedly abridge\u201d acts normally comprehended within the first amendment, there is no abridgment of first amendment rights. Cox v. New Hampshire, <em>supra </em>at 574. Nor is there any abridgment of first amendment rights arising from the congressional authorization granting a union the power to collect dues from employees in a \u201cunion shop.\u201d The congressional purpose in authorizing mandatory union dues is surely a permissible one, for Congress was understandably concerned with minimizing industrial strife and thereby insuring the unimpeded flow of commerce. It was the legislative judgment that these goals are most easily realized if a suitable collective bargaining apparatus exists, see, e. g., International Association of Machinists v. Street, 367 U.S. 740, 760, 81 S.Ct. 1784, 6 L.Ed.2d 1141 (1961), and so the national labor laws provide for an exclusive bargaining agent to represent each discrete employee bargaining unit. See, e. g\u201e \u00a7 9(a) of the NLRA, 29 U.S.C. \u00a7 159(a). To enable these agents to fulfill their statutory responsibility to represent all the employees while collectively bargaining with the employer, the statutes permit the levying of mandatory dues on all employees who will reap the benefits of the union\u2019s representation of them in the contract negotiations with the employer. A required tolerance of \u201cfree riders,\u201d i. e., those who enjoy the benefits of the union\u2019s negotiating efforts without assuming a corresponding portion of the union\u2019s financial burden, would result not only in flagrant inequity, see, e. g., NLRB v. General Motors Corp., 373 U.S. 734, 740-743, 83 S. Ct. 1453, 10 L.Ed.2d 670 (1963); Radio Officers\u2019 Union v. NLRB, 347 U.S. 17, 41, 74 S.Ct. 323, 98 L.Ed. 455 (1954), but might also eventually seriously undermine the union\u2019s ability to perform its bargaining function. It is thus manifest that the statutory treatment of mandatory union dues serves a \u201csubstantial public interest.\u201d</p>\n<p id=\"b375-5\">Moreover, we find that the means adopted to achieve this proper purpose of reducing industrial strife are reasonable, and do not \u201cunwarrantedly abridge\u201d free speech. The dues here are not flat fees imposed directly on the exercise of a federal right. See Murdock v. Pennsylvania, 319 U.S. 105, 113-114, 63 S.Ct. 870, 87 L.Ed.2d 1292 (1943). To the contrary, assuming <em>arguendo </em>that government action is involved here, the dues more logically would constitute the employee\u2019s share of the expenses of operating a valid labor regulatory system which serves a substantial public purpose. If there is any burden on appellees\u2019 free speech it would appear to be no more objectionable than a \u201cnondiseriminatory [form] of general taxation\u201d which can be constitutionally imposed on the communication media. Branzburg v. Hayes, 408 U.S. 665, 683, 92 S.Ct. 2646, 33 L.Ed.2d 626 (1972); Grosjean v. American Press Co., 297 U. S. 233, 250, 56 S.Ct. 444, 80 L.Ed. 660 (1936).</p>\n<p id=\"b375-6\">Appellees also contend that they did not seek, and do not desire, to be represented by the union and that as they have not derived any substantial benefit from the union\u2019s representation they are not \u201cfree riders.\u201d The district judge accepted this contention, and although he found that the appellees derived some benefit from their memberships in union pension plans, he regarded this as not being substantial enough <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"312\">*312</page-number>to make the appellees \u201cfree riders.\u201d We disagree with the district court. There is no rational basis for distinguishing between the degrees of benefit one enjoys as a result of a union\u2019s bargaining efforts on his behalf.<footnotemark>2</footnotemark></p>\n<p id=\"b376-4\">Turning now to the allegations that on pain of loss of employment the requirements of compulsory union membership and compulsory compliance with union regulations also violate the constitutional rights of plaintiffs to be employed by the media, we hold that the district court did not have jurisdiction to adjudicate these matters. Although appellees\u2019 complaints do not explicitly allege violations of \u00a7\u00a7 8(a)(3) and 8(b)(2),<footnotemark>3</footnotemark> they do aver the commission of acts which we find are \u201carguable\u201d unfair labor practices under those sections of the NLRA. When unfair labor practices are alleged \u201cthe federal courts must defer to the exclusive competence of the National Labor Relations Board.\u201d San Diego Building Trades Council v. Garmon, <em>supra </em>at 245; accord, Amalgamated Ass\u2019n of Street, Elec. Ry. &amp; Motor Coach Employees v. Lockridge, 403 U.S. 274, 91 S.Ct. 1909, 29 L.Ed.2d 473 (1971).</p>\n<p id=\"b376-12\">Both Buckley and Evans claim that they have not only been compelled to pay dues to the union but have also been \u201crequired\u201d to join the applicable local organization and to comply with union rules and regulations.<footnotemark>4</footnotemark> The union does not deny that its representatives informed Buckley that the ultimate penalty for failing to remain a \u201cfull-fledged\u201d member would be his discharge from employment. It is abundantly clear that an \u201carguable\u201d unfair labor practice would result if the union should carry out this threat.<footnotemark>5</footnotemark> Buckley apprises <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"313\">*313</page-number>us that he refrained from resigning from the union because he feared that he would suffer loss of media employment and also incur the significant hardships that would undoubtedly accompany such a discharge.<footnotemark>6</footnotemark> Buckley\u2019s decision not to resign was not an unreasonable decision, and it did not bar him from seeking declaratory relief. But inasmuch as the union conduct to which Buckley objects constituted arguable unfair labor practices, his selection of forum was incorrect. He should have taken his cause to the National Labor Relations Board, an administrative agency fully capable of granting declaratory relief to him if circumstances warrant such relief. See 5 U.S.C. \u00a7 554(e).</p>\n<p id=\"b377-4\">The only oral representations made to Evans were those made by his prospective employer. The substance of these remarks was that before Evans could appear on the \u201cSpectrum\u201d Radio Series, Evans had to join the union because the employer\u2019s collective bargaining agreement mandated it. It also seems that Evans, as well as Buckley, believes that the requirements of compulsory membership, and the duty to comply with union rules and regulations, are imposed on him by the combination, on the one hand, of \u00a7 84 of AFTRA\u2019s Code of Fair Practice to which Evans\u2019s employer is subject under the collective bargaining agreement it has with AFTRA, and, on the other, Article XVIII of the AFTRA Constitution, to which Evans himself would appear to be subject as a \u201cfull-fledged\u201d member of the union. Section 84 is the compulsory unionism clause, i. e., the provision obligating the employer to employ only those persons who are AFTRA members in good standing, or those who become such AFTRA members within thirty days of the inception of the employment relationship. Article XVIII of the AFTRA Constitution, quoted <em>supra, </em>gives the union the power to expel from membership any member who \u201cshall fail to observe\u201d any union rule or regulation. At first glance, the union would seem to have attempted to reserve to itself the power to force an employer to discharge an employee by the simple expedient of expelling the employee from union membership for <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"314\">*314</page-number>any real or imagined infraction of its rules or regulations. On the other hand, \u00a7\u00a7 8(a)(3) and 8(b) (2)\u2019s substantial limitation on the ability of the union to so affect the employment relationship appears to receive implicit recognition in \u00a7 84 itself, which provides for automatic amendment of the section if the NLRA should be \u201crepealed or amended so as to permit a <em>stricter </em>union security clause (emphasis added).\u201d Evans\u2019s case is distinguishable from Buckley\u2019s case in that Evans\u2019s case relies principally on these broad union-drafted documents rather than on the highly specific warnings Buckley received. However, in any event, it is the function of the NLRB to ascertain whether Evans\u2019s controversy is sufficiently developed to enable it to declare the rights of the parties, and, if the controversy has so evolved, whether the union commits or would commit unfair labor practices by indulging in the conduct about which Evans is apprehensive.</p>\n<p id=\"b378-4\">Reversed and remanded.</p>\n<footnote label=\"1\">\n<p id=\"b374-6\">. The Tenth Circuit disagrees with the First and has held that \u00a7 8(a) (3) does not render union shop agreements \u201cgovernment action.\u201d Reid v. McDonnell Douglas Corp., 443 F.2d 408, 409-411 (10 Cir. 1971).</p>\n</footnote>\n<footnote label=\"2\">\n<p id=\"b376-6\">. Of course we do not decide whether employees who have derived <em>no </em>demonstrable benefit from a union\u2019s efforts are \u201cfree riders.\u201d</p>\n</footnote>\n<footnote label=\"3\">\n<p id=\"b376-7\">. Such allegations are unnecessary.</p>\n<blockquote id=\"b376-8\">Assuredly the proposition that Lockridge\u2019s complaint was not subject to the exclusive jurisdiction of the NLRB because it charged a breach of contract rather than an unfair labor practice is not tenable. Pre-emption, as shown above, is designed to shield the system from conflicting regulation of conduct. It is the conduct being regulated, not the formal description. of governing legal standards, that is the proper focus of concern. Amalgamated Ass\u2019n of Street, Elec. Ry. &amp; Motor Coach Employees v. Lockridge, 403 U.S. 274, 292, 91 S.Ct. 1909, 29 L.Ed.2d 473 (1971).</blockquote>\n</footnote>\n<footnote label=\"4\">\n<p id=\"b376-9\">. The imposition of the \u201crequirements\u201d of membership and compliance with union rules is, as we shall demonstrate, conduct by which the union <em>arguably </em>violates \u00a7 8 of the National Labor Relations Act. As such, it is subject to the preemptive jurisdiction of the NLRB, San Diego Building Trades Council v. Garmon, supra. Abstention by the federal district courts is necessary to prevent \u201cconflicting regulation of conduct.\u201d Amalgamated Ass\u2019n of Street, Elec. Ry. &amp; Motor Coach Employees v. Lockridge, supra at 292. The dues requirement which we have already considered stands on a different footing, however. Not only is that requirement not arguably violative of \u00a7 8, as it must be for the jurisdiction of a federal district court to be preempted, it is incontestably <em>authorized </em>by that section. Deferring to the NLRB on the dues question is thus mandated neither by the <em>Garmon </em>test itself nor by the <em>Garmon </em>philosophy of fostering uniform and consistent treatment of the modes of conduct that Congress has sought to prohibit in \u00a7 8 of the National Labor Relations Act.</p>\n<p id=\"b376-14\">Furthermore, our retention of jurisdiction over the dues claim does not render this case a proper occasion for the invocation of the doctrine of pendent jurisdiction. Application of the doctrine is discretionary, Winnick v. Manning, 460 F.2d 545, 550 (2 Cir. 1972); C. Wright, The Law of Federal Courts \u00a7 19, at 64 (2d ed. 1970), and seems particularly inappropriate under the circumstances here where the membership and rules compliance issues are distinct from the dues claim, and do not constitute alternative theories on the same pivotal facts as the dues claim, and where the judicial and legislative policy favoring uniform treatment of conduct arguably constituting unfair labor practices demands that one specialized agency, the NLRB, assume the principal responsibility for shaping the law.</p>\n</footnote>\n<footnote label=\"5\">\n<p id=\"b376-15\">. See NLRA \u00a7\u00a7 8(a) (3), 8(b) (2), 29 U.S.C. \u00a7 158(a)(3), (b)(2); NLRB v. Allis-Chalmers Mfg. Co., 388 U.S. 175, 197 n. 37, 87 S.Ct. 2001, 18 L.Ed.2d 1123 (1967); NLRB v. General Motors Corp., 373 U.S. 734, 742, 83 S.Ct. 1453, 10 L.Ed.2d 670 (1963). Indeed, in its brief, and at oral argument in this court the union concedes that \u201cthe imposition of obligations of membership other <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"313\">*313</page-number>than, dues-payment will depend on continued full-fledged membership, which . . . cannot be imposed on pain of loss of employment.\u201d</p>\n<p id=\"b377-8\">The union also acknowledges that Buckley and Evans can avoid any other sanctions which the union might seek to impose on them by resigning from \u201cfull-fledged membership while continuing to pay dues.\u201d The union attempts to qualify this concession, however, by noting that \u201cwhether Buckley and Evans can freely exercise [the right to resign from full-fledged membership] depends on circumstances.\u201d The union\u2019s assumption that Buckley and Evans can currently be considered \u201cfull-fledged\u201d members is suspect. At least in Buckley\u2019s case, the misrepresentations made to him that to retain his employment he was required to be and to remain a full-fledged AFTRA member appear to be sufficient to vitiate any \u201cconsent\u201d he may have given to becoming and remaining a full-fledged member. Sheraton-Kauai Corp. v. NLRB, 429 F.2d 1352, 1357 (9 Cir. 1970).</p>\n<p id=\"b377-9\">As to whether there are issues of arguable unfair labor practices, we would point out that the union may have already violated \u00a7 8 (b) (1) of the NLRA by \u201ccoercing\u201d Buckley, and possibly Evans, into becoming full-fledged members of the union. Under \u00a7 7 of the Act, Buckley apparently had the right to refrain from becoming a full-fledged member. The union\u2019s misrepresentations to him regarding his obligations to the union appear to have effectively coerced Buckley into incurring responsibilities he was not required to accept. Coercion may be \u201cinferred\u201d from the success of these misrepresentations. Sheraton-Kauai Corp. v. NLRB, supra at 1357.</p>\n</footnote>\n<footnote label=\"6\">\n<p id=\"b377-11\">. We note that the appellees\u2019 right to continued media employment will not be endangered should they seek to crystallize their controversies with the union by resigning from full-fledged union membership. As long as they forward dues to the union they, through NLRB intervention, should be able to obtain a federal district court injunction against their discharge from employment, see 29 U.S.C. \u00a7 160(j), pending disposition of any litigation which might follow resignations. A threat of irreparable injury would exist, and, as we have explained, and as the union has conceded, there would be an excellent chance that Buckley and Evans would succeed on the merits of a claim that the payment of dues is a sufficient compliance.</p>\n</footnote>\n</opinion>\n<opinion data-order=\"11\" data-type=\"opinion\" id=\"x999-2\" type=\"concurrence\">\n<author id=\"b378-5\">FRIENDLY, Circuit Judge</author>\n<p id=\"AS\">(concurring) :</p>\n<p id=\"b378-6\">I concur in the result and in the majority\u2019s holding that \u00a7 8(a)(3) is constitutional insofar as it permits a union to require employees in a union shop to pay ordinary dues and fees even if the employees- are radio and television commentators. However, I disagree that the issues of compulsory membership and compliance with union regulations, as presented on this appeal, fall within the exclusive jurisdiction of the National Labor Relations Board. The appellees sought a declaratory judgment that AF-TRA\u2019s union security agreement, authorized by \u00a7 8(a)(3) of the Act, violated their constitutional rights, in part because it would expose them to union discipline and require them to become union members. Federal courts must give way to the National Labor Relations Board when the claim is that the conduct in question violates the unfair labor practice provisions of the NLRA. And to the extent that the appellees contend that the union would be committing an unfair labor practice by imposing fines or otherwise disciplining them, I agree that their claim is preempted. However, the real thrust of appellees\u2019 argument seems rather to be that the Act authorizes the union to discipline them and is therefore unconstitutional. Since the preemption doctrine does not extend to constitutional attacks on the National Labor Relations Act, see Seay v. McDonnell Douglas Corp., 427 F.2d 996, 1002-1004 (9 Cir. 1970); Lewis v. AFTRA, 71 Misc.2d 253, 336 N.Y.S.2d 56 (Sup.Ct.1972), aff\u2019d, 41 App.Div.2d 707, 341 N.Y.S.2d 625 (1st Dep\u2019t 1973), the district court\u2019s jurisdiction over the constitutional claims in this case was not preempted. However, as the court points out in footnote 5, and as the union concedes, an employee under the union shop provision of the Act need not accept \u201cfull-fledged\u201d membership in the union, and thus can avoid the disciplinary sanctions to which \u201cfull-fledged\u201d members may be subjected. Under this construction, I see no constitutional infirmity in \u00a7 8(a)(3) even as applied to persons whose First Amendment protection is of peculiar importance.</p>\n</opinion>\n</casebody>\n",
