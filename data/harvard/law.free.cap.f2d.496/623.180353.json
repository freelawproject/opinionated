JOSEPH SMITH, Circuit Judge:</author>\n<p id=\"b689-18\">This is an appeal from an order of the United States District Court, Western District of New York, John T. Curtin, Judge, dated March 7, 1973, dismissing appellant\u2019s complaint on the pleadings. We reverse in part, affirm in part and remand for further proceedings.</p>\n<p id=\"b689-19\">Appellant Reverend Jackson brought suit against thirteen charitable foundations located in the Buffalo, New York area alleging racial discrimination against himself, his children and his foundation in that the appellee foundations refused to hire him as a director of their foundations, refused to give scholarships to his children and refused to grant money to his foundation, all for reasons of race. Appellant also challenged an alleged pattern of discriminatory employment and investment by the foundations. Reverend Jackson sought injunctive and declaratory relief, damages, the revocation of appellees\u2019 tax exempt status under the Internal Revenue Code, and an order directing the foundations to surrender all their assets to the United States Treasury. Judge Curtin dismissed the complaint, ruling that insofar as appellant\u2019s claims were based on 42 U.S.C. \u00a7 1983, Moose Lodge No. 107 v. Irvis, 407 U.S. 163, 92 S.Ct. 1965, 32 L.Ed.2d 627 (1972), precluded a finding of \u201cstate action\u201d and thus required dismissal, that to the extent that the claims were based on 42 U.S.C. \u00a7\u00a7 1981 and 1985 there were insufficient. facts stated in the complaint, and that Reverend Jackson had no standing to challenge appellees\u2019 tax exemptions.</p>\n<p id=\"b689-20\"> Throughout these proceedings, Reverend Jackson has appeared <em>pro se. </em>This fact no doubt explains much of the confusion in his complaint and in his briefs. That confusion is compounded by appellant\u2019s shotgun approach to this litigation, an approach which casts some doubt on the substantiality of his <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"626\">*626</page-number>claims.<footnotemark>1</footnotemark> Still, courts must construe <em>pro se </em>complaints generously, Haines v. Kerner, 404 U.S. 519, 92 S.Ct. 594, 30 L.Ed. 2d 652 (1972), and it is for the district court and not for us to judge factual issues.</p>\n<p id=\"b690-4\">I.</p>\n<p id=\"b690-5\">Although a liberal reading of appellant\u2019s complaint evidences a sufficient basis to give him standing to challenge appellees\u2019 tax exemptions, <em>see </em>McGlotten v. Connally, 338 F.Supp. 448, 452 (D.D.C.1972) (three-judge court), and Falkenstein v. Department of Revenue, 350 F.Supp. 887, 888 (D.Or.1972) (three-judge court), appeal dismissed, Oregon State Elks Ass\u2019n v. Falkenstein, 409 U.S. 1099, 93 S.Ct. 907, 34 L.Ed.2d 681 (1973), the complaint, insofar as it seeks revocation of the appellees\u2019 federal and state tax exempt status, is deficient on its face for failure to join the Secretary of the Treasury and the New York State Tax Commissioner, who would be indispensable parties to a suit- for such relief.<footnotemark>2</footnotemark> Moreover, appellant has not alleged facts which would give him standing to challenge past employment and investment patterns, failing to show how he personally has been affected by these practices.<footnotemark>3</footnotemark> Neither has he displayed an explicit intention to sue in a representative capacity. Since appellant is appearing <em>pro se, </em>we leave these matters for the district court to deal with on remand, without prejudice to motions to join necessary parties and to amend the complaint to allege additional facts. Further, the district court should consider requesting that counsel represent appellant. In this regard, we note that if appellant\u2019s foundation is incorporated it may only appear with counsel. Shapiro, Bernstein &amp; Co. v. Continental Record Co., 386 F.2d 426 (2d Cir. 1967).</p>\n<p id=\"b690-14\">This court has jurisdiction to consider appellant\u2019s challenge to appellees\u2019 tax exemptions.<footnotemark>4</footnotemark> <em>See McGlotten, supra, </em>338 F.Supp. at 452-453.</p>\n<p id=\"b690-15\">II.</p>\n<p id=\"b690-16\">Appellant\u2019s \u00a7 1983 claim against the foundations as well as the tax exemption challenges require us to wade \u201cinto the murky waters of the \u2018state action\u2019 doctrine.\u201d</p>\n<p id=\"b690-17\">The court below dismissed appellant\u2019s \u00a7 1983 claim on the authority of <em>Moose </em><page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"627\">*627</page-number><em>Lodge, supra. </em>That decision involved a suit by a guest of a member of the lodge who was refused service because he was black. He brought suit under \u00a7 1983 against both the lodge and the Pennsylvania Liquor Authority, which had granted a liquor license to the lodge. The Supreme Court held that the grant of the license did not constitute \u201cstate action,\u201d distinguishing Burton v. Wilmington Parking Authority, 365 U.S. 715, 81 S.Ct. 856, 6 L.Ed.2d 45 (1961), where \u201cstate action\u201d had been found on the grounds that the discriminating Eagle Restaurant constituted part of the Parking Authority project. The <em>Moose Lodge </em>Court emphasized that Pennsylvania did not benefit from the lodge as Delaware Rad benefited from the restaurant (in terms of the enhanced viability of the Parking Authority), that the lodge was located on private property whereas the restaurant had been on public land, and that the lodge was a \u201cprivate club\u201d whereas the restaurant had been open to the general public, save black people.</p>\n<p id=\"b691-14\">Whether private conduct which is in some manner aided by the actions of the State is or is not \u201cstate action\u201d for the purposes of the Fourteenth Amendment is not an easy question.<footnotemark>5</footnotemark> \u201cOnly by sifting facts and weighing circumstances can the non-obvious involvement of the State in private conduct be attributed its true significance. Burton . . .at 722, 81 S.Ct. 856.\u201d <em>Moose Lodge, supra, </em>407 U.S. at 172, 92 S.Ct. at 1971. This appears to be the first case in which the issue of the status of tax-exempt \u201cprivate foundations\u201d <footnotemark>6</footnotemark> has been raised.</p>\n<p id=\"b692-3\"><page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"628\">*628</page-number>Prior case law while not directly controlling is not, of course, unenlightening. It is noteworthy that several courts have considered claims that the activities of tax-exempt organizations constitute \u201cstate action.\u201d Significantly, these cases divide into two groups: Where racial discrimination is involved, the courts have found \u201cstate action\u201d to exist; where other constitutional claims are at issue (due process, freedom of speech), the courts have generally concluded that no \u201cstate action\u201d has occurred. <em>Compare, McGlotten, supra; </em><footnotemark>7</footnotemark> Pitts v. De<page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"629\">*629</page-number>partment of Revenue, 333 F.Supp. 662 (E.D.Wis.1971) (three-judge court); Falkenstein, <em>supra; </em>Smith v. YMCA of Montgomery, 316 F.Supp. 899 (M.D. Ala.1970), modified, 462 F.2d 634 (5th Cir. 1972), <em>with </em>Powe v. Miles, 407 F.2d 73 (2d Cir. 1968); Browns v. Mitchell, 409 F.2d 593 (10th Cir. 1969); Chicago Joint Board, Amalgamated Clothing Workers v. Chicago Tribune Co., 435 F. 2d 470 (7th Cir. 1970), cert. denied, 402 U.S. 973, 91 S.Ct. 1662, 29 L.Ed.2d 138 (1971); Bright v. Isenbarger, 314 F.Supp. 1382 (N.D.Ind.1970), aff\u2019d 445 F.2d 412 (7th Cir. 1971) and Marker v. Schultz, 485 F.2d 1003 (D.C.Cir.1973). <em>See also, </em>Walz v. Tax Commission, 397 U.S. 664, 90 S.Ct. 1409, 25 L.Ed.2d 697 (1970). This dichotomy is explained in part by the double \u201cstate action\u201d standard which has been recognized \u2014 one, a less onerous test for cases involving racial discrimination, and a more rigorous standard for other claims. <em>See, e.g., </em>Lefcourt v. Legal Aid Society, 445 F.2d 1150, 1155 n. 6 (2d Cir. 1971); Wolin v. Port Authority, 392 F.2d 83, 89 (2d Cir. 1968), cert. denied, 393 U.S. 940, 89 S. Ct. 290, 21 L.Ed.2d 275 (1969); <em>Powe, supra, </em>407 F.2d at 81-82; <em>Pitts, supra, </em>333 F.Supp. at 668-669. However, these results may also be explainable in terms of facts and circumstances peculiar to each case.</p>\n<p id=\"b693-5\">A review of the \u201cstate action\u201d case law suggests five factors which are particularly important to a determination of \u201cstate action\u201d: (1) the degree to which the \u201cprivate\u201d organization is dependent on governmental aid; (2) the extent and intrusiveness of the governmental regulatory scheme; (3) whether that scheme connotes government approval of the activity or whether the assistance is merely provided to all without such connotation; (4) the extent to which the organization serves a public function or acts as a surrogate for the State; (5) whether the organization has legitimate claims to recognition as a \u201cprivate\u201d organization in associational or other constitutional terms.</p>\n<p id=\"b693-9\">Each of these factors is material; no one factor is conclusive.</p>\n<p id=\"b693-10\">While the record before us with regard to the particular defendant foundations is meager, it does appear that private tax-exempt foundations in many instances may well involve \u201cstate action.\u201d</p>\n<p id=\"b693-11\">The defendant foundations no doubt receive substantial assistance in the form of tax exemptions. Green v. Kennedy, 309 F.Supp. 1127, 1134 (D.D.C. 1970) (three-judge court); Norwood v. Harrison, 413 U.S. 455, 93 S.Ct. 2804, 37 L.Ed.2d 723, 730-733 (1973); <em>Marker, supra, </em>485 F.2d at 1006, n. 4; <em>Mc-Glotten, supra, </em>338 F.Supp. at 456, n. 37 and 459, n. 58; Bob Jones University v. Connally, 341 F.Supp. 277, 281 (D.S.C. 1971) , rev\u2019d on other grounds, 472 F.2d 903, 906 (4th Cir. 1973), cert. granted, 414 U.S. 817, 94 S.Ct. 116, 38 L.Ed.2d 49 (1973). It is highly unlikely that they could sustain their programs at anywhere near present levels without the exemptions.<footnotemark>8</footnotemark> It might well be that, ab<page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"630\">*630</page-number>sent these exemptions, these foundations would never have been established.</p>\n<p id=\"b694-4\">It appears also that these foundations are subject to a \u201csustained and detailed administrative relationship for enforcement of statutory-standards. . . . \u201d <em>Walz, supra, </em>397 U.S. at 675, 90 S.Ct. at 1414.</p>\n<p id=\"b694-6\">The 1969 Tax Reform Act requires every tax-exempt foundation to file an annual information return with the Internal Revenue Service.<footnotemark>9</footnotemark> The annual report must be made available for public inspection for a period of 180 days after newspaper notice of its availability.<footnotemark>10</footnotemark> The Internal Revenue Service has assured Congress that it is closely scrutinizing the activities of \u201cprivate foundations.\u201d <footnotemark>11</footnotemark> The 1969 Tax Reform Act imposed an excise tax on the net in<page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"631\">*631</page-number>vestment income of private exempt foundations, the revenue to finance the surveillance mechanisms contemplated by the Act.<footnotemark>12</footnotemark> The Tax Reform Act also mandated certain changes in the charters of exempt foundations. Foundation charters must now include provisions which expressly require adherence to the substantive limitations on foundation activity provided for in the Act.<footnotemark>13</footnotemark></p>\n<p id=\"b696-3\"><page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"632\">*632</page-number>The most relevant of the substantive limitations is 26 U.S.C. \u00a7 4945(a)-(d) and (g).<footnotemark>14</footnotemark> These sections provide that a foundation which gives grants to individuals must do so in an \u201cobjective and non-discriminatory\u201d manner. If it does not do so, the foundation and the manager who approved that grant are respectively subject to an \u201cexcise tax\u201d of 10% and <em>2y2% </em>of the offending grant. If the offending grant is not recovered to the extent that recovery is possible by the foundation within a certain time, the fines are increased to 100% and 50%. These provisions would appear to apply to Reverend Jackson\u2019s complaint of discrimination in the failure to award scholarships to his children. These provisions .would also appear to oppose the notion that \u201cstate action\u201d is present.</p>\n<p id=\"b696-4\">However, these appearances may be deceiving. The abuse which Congress sought to curb by means of these provisions was the practice of making grants to the well-connected few, not a practice of failure to make grants to candidates selected out for suspect reasons. Professor Bittker puts the statute in historical context:</p>\n<blockquote id=\"b696-5\">Section 4945\u2019s restrictions on \u201cindividual grants\u201d by private foundations are also best viewed, if one wants to be realistic, as a bit of legislation whose general form belies its specific origin. If the Ford Foundation had not made its famous grants to members of Senator Kennedy\u2019s staff when they left their federal jobs after his assassination, it is not likely that the Senate Finance Committee would have concluded that</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b696-11\">existing law does not effectively limit the extent to which foundations can use their money for \u201ceducational\u201d grants to enable people to take their vacations abroad, to have paid interludes between jobs, and to subsidize the preparation of materials furthering specific political viewponts.</blockquote>\n<p id=\"b696-12\">Bittker, Should Foundations Be Third-Class Charities?, in The Future of Foundations, pp. 132, 157-58.</p>\n<p id=\"b696-13\">The House Report stated:</p>\n<blockquote id=\"b696-14\">The bill also prohibits nonobjective grants to individuals. This provision does not affect private foundations which engage in extensive programs involving grants to individuals chosen as a result of open competitions or on any other nondiscriminatory programmatic basis. Also, certain foundations have developed an expertise in grant-making that is utilized by other private foundations. These developments in the private foundation field are in accord with the concern of your committee that expertise and fairness replace whim and personal relationships in such matters.</blockquote>\n<p id=\"b697-4\"><page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"633\">*633</page-number>H.R.Rep.No.91-413, 91st Cong., 1st Sess. 34, U.S.Code Cong. &amp; Admin.News, p. 1679 (1969).</p>\n<p id=\"b697-5\">The remedy provided tracks this reading of Congressional intent: Since the evil was awarding grants for invalid reasons, the remedy is the revocation of the grant. If the evil were a failure to award a grant for invalid reasons, revocation would make little sense as a remedy. <em>In accord, </em>Treas.Reg. \u00a7 53.4945-4(b)(5).</p>\n<p id=\"b697-6\">Congress attempted in \u00a7 4945 to prevent nepotism and favoritism in grant-making, examples of the use of foundation assets for private purposes. There is no evidence to the effect that Congress sought to prevent foundations from choosing on the basis of race between two public uses of foundation assets.<footnotemark>15</footnotemark> Properly construed, these provisions are only further evidence of the instrusiveness of the regulatory scheme.</p>\n<p id=\"b697-7\">Such an intrusive and detailed scheme was deemed necessary to prevent the use of foundations\u2019 assets for a wide range of private purposes, such as profit-taking, control of businesses, and nepotism, and to ensure that the fruits of exemption benefit the public. As the Report of the House Committee on Ways and Means, H.R.Rep.No.91-413, 91st Cong., 1st Sess. 39, U.S.Code Cong. &amp; Admin. News, p. 1684 (1969) stated:</p>\n<blockquote id=\"b697-8\">your committee has determined that organizations should not receive substantial and continuing tax benefits in exchange for the promise of their contributions to society, and then avoid the carrying out of these responsibilities.</blockquote>\n<p id=\"b697-11\"><em>Accord, </em>Senate Finance Committee, S.Rep.No.91-552, 91st Cong., 1st Sess. 55, U.S.Code Cong. &amp; Admin.News, p. 2027 (1969). As one commentator concludes, the \u201c . . . Act\u2019s basic approach is to locate and maintain contact with the foundations. . . .\u201d Private Foundations under the Tax Reform Act of 1969, 7 Colum.J.Law &amp; Soc. Prob. 240, 254 (1971).</p>\n<p id=\"b697-14\">The exemptions in question are not the type of government assistance such as police or fire protection, which is routinely provided to all without any connotation of approval. <em>See Moose Lodge, supra, </em>407 U.S. at 173, 92 S.Ct. 1965. Organizations must apply for exempt status.<footnotemark>16</footnotemark> Moreover, the acts of application and approval are not value neutral. In effect, the government would appear to be certifying that every foundation on its tax-exempt list is laboring in the public interest. <em>Compare, Marker, supra, </em>485 F.2d at 1007, <em>with McGlotten, supra, </em>338 F.Supp. at 456-457.</p>\n<p id=\"b697-15\">It also appears that the defendant foundations cannot assert a constitutional claim to be left alone. <em>Compare, </em>Gilmore v. City of Montgomery, 473 F.2d 832, 838-839 (5th Cir. 1973), cert. granted, 414 U.S. 907, 94 S.Ct. 215, 38 L.Ed.2d 145 (1973) and Bob Jones University, 341 F.Supp. at 285, with Green v. Connally, <em>supra, </em>n. 2, 330 F.Supp. at 1165-1168. While these organizations may not hold themselves out to the public as open to all but a few as did the Eagle Restaurant, they surely are not private clubs which value the intimate relationships among their members as did the Moose Lodge. To the extent that any constitutional rights are in-<page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"634\">*634</page-number>volved here, it is more likely the right to dispose of one\u2019s property as one chooses. Yet it is well settled that one cannot dispose of property in a racially discriminatory manner and entangle the State in the process. Evans v. Newton, 382 U.S. 296, 301, 86 S.Ct. 486, 15 L.Ed.2d 373 (1966); Commonwealth of Pennsylvania v. Brown, 392 F.2d 120 (3d Cir.), cert. denied, 391 U.S. 921, 88 S.Ct. 1811, 20 L.Ed.2d 657 (1968).</p>\n<p id=\"b698-4\">As to public function, there may be more question. The legislative history concerning the purpose of the Internal Revenue Code\u2019s charitable exemption and deduction sets forth this rationale:</p>\n<blockquote id=\"AyM\">The [deduction] is based upon the theory that the Government is compensated for the loss of revenue by its relief from financial burden which would otherwise have to be met by appropriations from public funds, and by the benefits resulting from the promotion of the general welfare.</blockquote>\n<p id=\"AyMN\">H.R.Rep.No.1860, 75th Cong., 3d Sess. 19 (1938). This might be said to raise something approaching a presumption that foundation activities are public functions. However, this may not be the case with respect to the particular foundations which are defendants in this case.<footnotemark>17</footnotemark> The record before us is unclear on this point.</p>\n<p id=\"b698-7\">In sum, we believe that if on remand the district court finds that the defendant foundations are substantially dependent upon their exempt status, that the regulatory scheme is both detailed and intrusive, that that scheme carries connotations of government approval, that the foundations do not have a substantial claim of constitutional protection, and that they serve some public function, then a finding of \u201cstate action\u201d would be appropriate. Moreover, even if one of these factors is absent, a finding of \u201cstate action\u201d may still be appropriate. On remand, the parties may be able to point to individual circumstances which distinguish the defendants from exempt private foundations generally. Again, the anticipated joining of the Commissioner of Internal Revenue and the State Tax Commissioner should illuminate the issues.<footnotemark>18</footnotemark></p>\n<p id=\"b698-8\">At least as to the appellee Buffalo Foundation, however, the-record is somewhat fuller and the balance must be struck somewhat differently. The Buffalo Foundation admitted in an affidavit in support of a motion for summary judgment that its by-laws provide that of its seven-member Governing Committee one member is to be appointed by the Mayor of Buffalo, one by the Surrogate of Erie County, one by the United <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"635\">*635</page-number>States District Court Judge of the Western District of New York, and one by the Senior Justice of the Supreme Court Trial Term in the Buffalo district. This type of governmental participation in the management of an organization comes perilously close to the situation in Pennsylvania v. Board of Trusts, 353 U. S. 230, 77 S.Ct. 806, 1 L.Ed.2d 792 (1957), where the position of an agency of the State as trustee of an organization was held sufficient without more to constitute \u201cstate action.\u201d Of course, here the control is less absolute and direct. But even indirect governmental participation in the management of an organization is persuasive evidence of the existence of \u201cstate action\u201d where that participation is both substantial and other than neutral. This is not to say that the Surrogate Court\u2019s traditional supervisory role transforms the estate or trust into \u201cstate action.\u201d <em>See, </em>United States National Bank v. Snodgrass, 202 Or. 530, 275 P.2d 860 (en banc 1954); Gordon v. Gordon, 332 Mass. 197, 124 N.E.2d 228, cert. denied, 349 U.S. 947, 75 S.Ct. 875, 99 L.Ed. 1273 (1955); Mayers v. Ridley, 151 U.S.App.D.C. 45, 465 F.2d 630, 658-659 (1972) (en banc, Tamm, J., dissenting). But here public officials, named in their <em>ex officio </em>capacities, control the selection of a majority of the governing body, and the Buffalo Foundation appears to have established, this procedure for the very purpose of involving the public in its activities. This participation is neither insignificant nor neutral. Therefore, as to the Buffalo Foundation, a finding of \u201cstate action\u201d may be warranted even if the court should find only some other significant evidence of \u201cstate action.\u201d</p>\n<p id=\"b699-5\">The formulation of this definition of \u201cstate action\u201d is applicable only to claims of racial discrimination. As noted above, conduct which is admittedly part private and part governmental must be more strictly scrutinized when claims of racial discrimination are made. Again, we think that the combination of factors noted gives courts sufficient room \u201c. . . so that a cluster of rooms in a college dormitory can be distinguished from a restaurant in a public facility, a bowling league from a bar association, and a radio repair shop from a TV broadcasting network.\u201d Bittker and Kaufman, Taxes and Civil Rights: \u201cConstitutionalizing\u201d the Internal Revenue Code, 82 Yale L.J. 51, 87 (1972). We doubt that the fruits of charity will wither on the vine as a result of a decision barring racial . discrimination. Tax-exempt philanthropy which constitutes \u201cstate action\u201d is limited thereby only to the extent of ensuring an absence of such discrimination. Truly private philanthropy, meanwhile, is not affected at all.</p>\n<p id=\"b699-7\">III.</p>\n<p id=\"b699-8\">Appellant challenges both federal and state exemptions. Since the two exemptions are clearly linked in practice (in terms of the near identity of the statutory definitions of exemption and in terms of administrative symbiosis) and in purpose and since the evil against which the Fifth and the Fourteenth Amendments were set was governmental fostering of racial discrimination and not merely state or merely federal action, similar treatment for constitutional purposes seems proper.</p>\n<p id=\"b699-9\">Appellant\u2019s \u00a7 1983 claim against the foundations raises a slightly different problem. 42 U.S.C. \u00a7 1983 proscribes only conduct \u201c . . . under color of any statute ... of any State . . . \u201d and has been construed as not applying to the actions of the federal government, District of Columbia v. Carter, 409 U.S. 418, 424-425, 93 S.Ct. 602, 34 L.Ed.2d 613 (1973); Wheeldin v. Wheeler, 373 U.S. 647, 650, n. 2, 83 S.Ct. 1441, 10 L.Ed.2d 605 (1963), unless there is conspiracy between the state and federal officials, Kletschka v. Driver, 411 F.2d 436, 448-449 (2d Cir. 1969). Since no colorable claim of such conspiracy can be made here (and none has been made), in determining whether appellant has a claim under \u00a7 1983 the district court should look only to the state exemptions.</p>\n<p id=\"b700-3\"><page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"636\">*636</page-number>Again, because of the state of the record before us, we cannot judge the impact of the state exemptions alone.<footnotemark>19</footnotemark></p>\n<p id=\"b700-4\">IV.</p>\n<p id=\"b700-5\">Appellant\u2019s claims under 42 U.

Since this is a <em>pro se </em>action further consideration of these claims is necessary. <em>Haines, </em>404 U.S. 520-521, 92 S.Ct. 594. If on remand appellant, hopefully with the assistance of counsel, cannot show applications to specific defendants, the existence of specific vacancies and grants, the existence of conspiratorial action on the part of the defendant foundations, or other material facts, summary judgment will be appropriate.</p>\n<p id=\"b700-6\">V.</p>\n<p id=\"b700-7\">The court below properly dismissed appellant\u2019s remaining claim.

True to form, appellant nowhere specifies wliat exemptions he is challenging. The appellee foundations have been understandably reluctant to fill this vacuum and identify the various exemptions they enjoy. Federal assistance is embodied by 26 U.S.C. \u00a7 501(c)(3), which exempts these organizations from income taxation and \u00a7\u00a7 170(c)(2), 642(c), 2055, 2106(a) and 2522, which make individual contributions to such organizations deductible for income, estate and gift tax purposes. Among the important state tax provisions are \u00a7 249-c of the New York State Tax Law, McKinney\u2019s Con-sol.Laws, c. 60, which exempts bequests to foundations from the estate tax, \u00a7\u00a7 208 and 615 of the Tax Law, which \u201cpiggy-back\u201d the federal income and corporate tax deduction provisions, and \u00a7 1230, which exempts these organizations from local taxation. The State\u2019s definition of exempt organizations substantially tracks the federal definition: \u201corganized and operated exclusively for religious, charitable, scientific, testing for public safety, literary, or educational purposes, or for the prevention of cruelty to children or animals. ...\u201d 26 U.S.C. \u00a7 501(c) (3).</p>\n</footnote>\n<footnote label=\"5\">\n<p id=\"b691-5\">.

There is a dispute in the literature as to the proper definition of a \u201cprivate foundation.\u201d Mr. Merrimon Cuninggim, head of the Danforth Foundation, states i</p>\n<blockquote id=\"b691-10\">Foundations . . . are often modified by the adjective \u201cprivate,\u201d but it is something of a misnomer and one ought to be chary about using the word. Their funds are not private, for the money no longer belongs to the original donor, whoever he is. Rather, it is public money, set aside to be so by an uncommon act of stewardship on the part of the donor. Correspondingly, the activities of foundations are not private, for a catalogue of them must be reported to the government as the representative of the people, and anyone is privileged to have a look. Their field of operation is not limited to the so-called private sector, for grants of many foundations have traditionally been made to a wide variety of governmental units and programs, large and small.</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b691-17\">The only sense in which \u201cprivate\u201d applies is that the decisions of foundations are not in the hands of the general public or of Government. This is, of course, an immensely important distinction; and the trouble is, we simply do not have a suitable word to describe the peculiar mixture of public and private that characterizes a foundation \u2014 a combination of public interest and public service with private judgment. It is for this reason that in the simplified definition above, the modifier is \u201cnon-governmental.\u201d To say it in that way may be more illuminating than simply to call foundations unmodifiedly \u201cprivate.\u201d A fuller definition might run to such a complicated, jawbreaking sentence as the following: Foundations are non-governmental agencies, privately established and managed, but in which the public has a stake and which are answerable to Government, possessing financial resources, usually in the form of endowment, and existing to serve the general welfare or some chosen segment of it, usually in the form of grants.</blockquote>\n<p id=\"b691-19\">M. Ouninggim, Private Money and Public Service (N.Y.1972), 4-5. Mr. Alan Pifer, President of the Carnegie Corporation, disagrees in part:</p>\n<blockquote id=\"b691-20\">The foundation is, paradoxically, both private and public in its nature. It is private because it is incorporated as a pri<page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"628\">*628</page-number>vate, non-governmental institution, derives its assets from private donors, and is privately controlled by a donor-appointed or self-perpetuating board of trustees.</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b692-5\">There is a common misunderstanding that the public character of the foundation, and hence the public stake in it, derives from its tax-exempt status. How frequently has one heard it said that foundations are really spending public money, and therefore should be subject to greater governmental control. Such a view, however, is based on fallacious reasoning and reveals either surprising ignorance or a dangerous disavowal of one of the basic tenets of the American system.</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b692-6\">Throughout our history we have believed in pluralism and have practiced it. We have recognized that the nation\u2019s public purposes are considerably more extensive in scope than its governmental purposes, and, through the aegis of the state, we have enabled a wide variety of private institutions, including foundations, to be chartered to accomplish certain <em>ptiblic, </em>though non-governmental, purposes. We have also, through- the aegis of the state, given tax exemption to these institutions to facilitate their work and have regarded this as being eminently in the public interest. Therefore, to attribute the public stake in the foundation to its tax-exempt status or to regard this status as a \u201cprivilege\u201d is wholly erroneous. It is, in Professor Milton Katz\u2019s pithy phrase, \u201cto mistake an effect for a cause.\u201d</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b692-7\">The true origin of the public aspect of the foundation lies in the nature of its activity. It is public because it devotes its funds to purposes in which the total society has a vital interest, such as education, health, and welfare. Grants in these fields do without question affect the public, and hence the public has a legitimate stake in the foundations which make them.</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b692-8\">But there is an even more important sense in which the foundation is public in character. It is public because the public cannot afford to regard with indifference how foundation funds are spent, so precious are they, as we have seen, in the vital process of social change, and so limited are they in amount. The $1.3 billion spent by foundations in 1967 was, for example, less than 0.2 per cent of the Gross National Product, less than 9 per cent of total voluntary giving, and only 3 per cent of the federal government\u2019s expenditure for health, education, and welfare.</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"ABF\">Foundation funds, in short, offer a case where a technically private asset is of such potential value to the nation that it must, perforce, be regarded as a public asset. The implications of this proposition are far reaching. . . .</blockquote>\n<p id=\"b692-12\">Report of the President of the Carnegie Corporation, 1968, in Reeves ed., Foundations Under Fire (Ithaca, 1970) 54-55.

Goldberg, and Oates, The Costs of Foundation-Supported Activities, Foundation News, July/August, 1973, pp. 35, 38. These latter activities are examples of public functions.</p>\n<p id=\"b698-6\">The Peterson Commission determined that foundation and government activity now largely overlap. Indeed, the Commission concluded that the relatively recent expansion of government activity required a reformation of the rationale for the foundation tax exemption \u2014 away from the notion that foundations do things that government is not doing or should not be doing and toward the idea that foundations should do certain things because they do those things better than government does them. This new rationale views foundations as more efficient than government in that foundations can be more flexible and more innovative than government. Peterson, <em>supra, </em>n. 5, at 6152-55. If it is the case that the defendant foundations engage in activity which is not undertaken by government only because of bureaucratic or majoritarian constraints on governmental action, then this activity should perhaps be considered as a \u201cpublic function.\u201d</p>\n</footnote>\n<footnote label=\"18\">\n<p id=\"b698-10\">. It is possible, however, that this issue will be mooted by a failure to survive summary judgment.</p>\n</footnote>\n<footnote label=\"19\">\n<p id=\"b700-10\">. <em>See, </em>Norwood v. Harrison, 413 U.S. 455, 93 S.Ct. at 2811, 37 L.Ed.2d at 732 (1973): A State may not grant the type of tangible financial aid here involved if that aid has a significant tendency to facilitate, reinforce, and support private discrimination. \u201c[Djecisions on the constitutionality of state involvement in private discrimination do not turn on whether the state aid adds up to 51 per cent or adds up to only 49 per cent of the support of the segregated institution.\u201d Poindexter v. Louisiana Financial Assistance Comm\u2019n, 275 F.Supp. 833, 854 (1967).</p>\n</footnote>\n</opinion>\n<opinion data-order=\"17\" data-type=\"opinion\" id=\"x999-2\" type=\"dissent\">\n<author id=\"b700-14\">FRIENDLY, Circuit Judge,</author>\n<p id=\"AZX\">with whom HAYS and MULLIGAN, Circuit Judges, join, dissenting from the denial of reconsideration en banc:</p>\n<p id=\"b700-15\">As stated in the panel opinion, this appears to be the first claim that, because of tax exemption, a denial of grants by private charitable foundations could constitute government action, for which an aggrieved applicant may obtain damages and declaratory or injunctive relief under the equal protection clause of the Fourteenth Amendment or its embodiment in the due process clause of the Fifth. Somewhat incredibly, the panel thought an affirmative answer to be so obvious as to deserve only a single paragraph of a per curiam opinion, slip opinion 573, 576, decided December 4, 1973. On December 12, 1973, I requested a poll of the judges in regular active service on reconsideration en banc; after several judges had voted for this, the panel requested that the vote be deferred pending preparation of a revised opinion. The new opinion, finding a variety of added reasons to reaffirm the previous conclusion, was not circulated until March 1, 1974. While it is even stronger against the defendants than the per curiam, in my view it is analytically unsound, dangerously open-ended, and at war with controlling precedent both in the Supreme Court and in this circuit. Indeed, with all deference, it seems to <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"637\">*637</page-number>me the most ill-advised decision with respect to \u201cstate action\u201d yet rendered by any court and unless corrected will be the source of enormous damage to the great edifice of private philanthropy which has been one of this country\u2019s most distinctive and admirable features. Although the defendants on remand may somehow manage to escape from the net the panel has woven<footnotemark>1</footnotemark> or, more likely, to show that plaintiff\u2019s criticisms are unfounded, the harm done by this opinion will remain. It is therefore most regrettable that, despite the request of half its present complement of judges now in regular active service, the court should decline reconsideration en banc.</p>\n<p id=\"b701-5\">I.</p>\n<p id=\"b701-6\">The panel\u2019s fundamental error is its loose characterization of the \u201cstate action\u201d doctrine. In holding that the federal and state tax exemptions provided to charitable foundations render them subject to civil rights suits challenging their policy decisions in the selection of beneficiai\u2019ies, the panel relies primarily on three-judge court cases that have struck down tax exemptions for institutions practicing the crudest form of racial discrimination \u2014 the exclusion of blacks from attendance in schools or membership in clubs of a public nature.<footnotemark>2</footnotemark> In these cases, however, the plaintiffs had sued federal or state officials to force revocation of tax benefits. The challenged action was clearly government action; the only question was whether that action sufficiently promoted private racial discrimination to render the decisions impermissible for a government officer, see Norwood v. Harrison, 413 U.S. 455, 93 S.Ct. 2804, 37 L.Ed.2d 723 (1973). In this case, by contrast, the plaintiff has sued the foundations themselves. While analysis of these two problems has occasionally overlapped, see McGlotten v. Connally, 338 F.Supp. 448, 455 (D.D.C.1972) (three-judge court); Bittker &amp; Kaufman, Taxes and Civil Rights: \u201cConstitutionalizing\u201d the Internal Revenue Code, 82 Yale L.J. 51, 61-63 (1972), there is a clear distinction between them. A holding that an otherwise private institution has become an arm of the state is much broader and can have far more serious consequences than a determination that the state has impermissibly fostered private discrimination. The foundation might be exposed to damage claims for prior discriminatory conduct and could be required by a court to make decisions not only as to the disposition of its charitable donations but in the selection of its employees in accordance with the restrictions properly imposed on governmental agencies. Indeed, it might not be able to escape the mark of government action even by disclaiming future tax benefits; the courts might hold that years of tax benefits had rendered the foundation\u2019s status as an agent of the state irrevocable, see Bittker &amp; Kaufman, <em>supra, </em>at 60-61.</p>\n<p id=\"b702-3\"><page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"638\">*638</page-number>II.</p>\n<p id=\"b702-4\">The implications of this decision for institutions receiving tax benefits of various sorts are staggering. Simply because of tax exemptions, private social agencies, community centers, institutions of higher education, homes for the young and the aged, endowed by private donors for the sole or preferential benefit of particular creeds or races, must open their doors equally to all, with every decision subject to judicial reexamination, even though this may impair or destroy the very purpose which led the donor to endow them. Beyond this, if the tax exemption given to charitable foundations converts their giving into government action, I see no really tenable basis for distinguishing the tax deductions allowed individuals and corporations.</p>\n<p id=\"b702-5\">Because of its broad availability, a tax exemption, in itself, has never previously been thought to impose the government\u2019s imprimatur sufficiently to convert the recipient into a <em>de facto </em>arm of the government. An exemption or other tax benefit, available to a wide range of institutions, has always been regarded as the least possible form of government support, except for the police and fire protection provided all citizens. The Chief Justice, writing for five Justices, said in Walz v. Tax Commission, 397 U. S. 664, 675, 90 S.Ct. 1409, 1415, 25 L. Ed.2d 697 (1970), \u201cno one has ever suggested that tax exemption has converted libraries, art galleries, or hospitals into arms of the state or put employees \u2018on the public payroll.\u2019 \u201d Still less had anyone ever suggested this, prior to the decision here, with respect to foundations, many of which are simply an incorporation of an individual\u2019s pocketbook.</p>\n<p id=\"b702-6\">There is no force in the panel\u2019s reliance on the government\u2019s regulation of foundations to <em>prevent </em>abuse of the tax exemption. The \u201cstate action\u201d cases that have stressed the heavy presence of government regulation are those in which private institutions are carrying out state policy <em>against </em>the plaintiffs <footnotemark>3</footnotemark> or in which the state is benefiting directly from the private activity. In Powe v. Miles, 407 F.2d 73, 81 (2 Cir. 1968), we rejected the argument that New York\u2019s regulation of educational standards in private schools, colleges and universities made the disciplinary actions of Alfred College the acts of the state. That argument, we noted,</p>\n<blockquote id=\"b702-9\">overlooks the essential point \u2014 that the state must be involved not simply with some activity of the institution alleged to have inflicted injury upon a plaintiff but with the activity that caused the injury. Putting the point another way, the state action, not the private action, must be the subject of complaint.</blockquote>\n<p id=\"b702-10\">The Supreme Court, in Moose Lodge No. 107 v. Irvis, 407 U.S. 163, 176-177, 92 S.Ct. 1965, 32 L.Ed.2d 627 (1972), made much the same point in discussing the regulations of the Pennsylvania Liquor Control Board, which applied to the Moose Lodge. \u201cHowever detailed this type of regulation may be in some particulars,\u201d the Court wrote, \u201cit cannot be said to in any way foster or encourage racial discrimination. Nor can it be said to make the State in any realistic sense a partner or even a joint venturer in the club\u2019s enterprise.\u201d The fact that Congress has deemed it necessary in I. R.C. \u00a7 501(c)(3) to limit the tax exemption to</p>\n<blockquote id=\"b702-11\">any . . . foundation, organized and operated exclusively for religious, charitable, scientific, testing for public safety, literary, or educational purposes, or for the prevention of cruelty to children or animals, no part of the net earnings of which inures to the benefit of any private shareholder or individual, no substantial part of the <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"639\">*639</page-number>activities of which is carrying on propaganda, or otherwise attempting to influence legislation, and which does not participate in, or intervene in (including the publishing or distributing of statements), any political campaign on behalf of any candidate for public office</blockquote>\n<p id=\"b703-5\">gives no encouragement to racial discrimination. And the detailed reporting and record-keeping requirements imposed upon charitable foundations have been established to ensure that the foundations, like all taxable entities, benefit from tax advantages only when they meet the statutory qualifications.<footnotemark>4</footnotemark> The panel\u2019s attempt to blur this essential distinction between a regulatory scheme in which a private institution plays a part in an offensive government policy and. one which is designed to prevent the institution\u2019s acting in an abusive way runs counter to our recent decisions in Shirley v. State National Bank of Connecticut, 493 F.2d 739 (2 Cir. 1974), and Bond v. Dentzer, 494 F.2d 302 (2 Cir. 1973). As Judge Mulligan wrote for us in the former, 493 F.2d 739, at 743, the \u201cenactment was ameliatory not regressive; it did not \u2018move in\u2019 on the plaintiff or other buyers, but rather on the instalment sellers.\u201d Private action does not become state action simply because government regulation has not gone so far as a plaintiff would like.</p>\n<p id=\"b703-6\">The panel\u2019s fleeting treatment of the \u201cpublic function\u201d argument is wholly unconvincing. Private charitable foundations are light years away from the \u201ccompany town\u201d analysis of Marsh v. Alabama, 326 U.S. 501, 66 S.Ct. 276, 90 L.Ed. 265 (1946), and Amalgamated Food Employees Union Local 590 v. Logan Valley Plaza, Inc., 391 U.S. 308, 88 S.Ct. 1601, 20 L.Ed.2d 603 (1968). Compare Lloyd Corp. v. Tanner, 407 U.S. 551, 92 S.Ct. 2219, 33 L.Ed.2d 131 (1972). Far less than the university which we held not to be an arm of the state in Powe v. Miles, <em>supra, </em>407 F.2d at 80, do they \u201cconcern activities or facilities so clearly governmental in nature that the state cannot be permitted to escape responsibility by allowing them to be managed by a supposedly private agency.\u201d</p>\n<p id=\"b703-9\">Whereas the panel blows the factors favoring a finding of state action out of all proportion in the context here presented, it unduly minimizes a factor pointing strongly the other way. As we said in Wahba v. New York University, 492 F.2d 96, at 102 (2 Cir. 1974), courts should pay heed, in testing for government action, to the \u201cvalue of preserving a private sector free from the constitutional requirements applicable to government institutions.\u201d An organization should not have to demonstrate an \u201cassociational or other constitutional\u201d claim to privacy, as the panel suggests, before the courts will take cognizance of the social values that private eleemosynary institutions can promote. The interest in preserving an area of untrammeled choice for private philanthropy is very great. Even among philanthropic insti<page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"640\">*640</page-number>tutions, the activities of charitable family foundations, receiving no government benefit other than tax exemption, should be the last to be swept, under a \u201csifting of facts and exercise of judgment,\u201d within the concept of state action. There are hundreds of thousands of foundations ranging from the giants to the pigmies. While most foundations, particularly large ones, give mainly to institutions serving all races and creeds, although hardly in the completely nondiscriminatory way required of public institutions, I see nothing offensive, either constitutionally or morally, in a foundation\u2019s choosing to give preferentially or even exclusively to Jesuit seminaries, to Yeshivas, to black colleges or to the NAACP. Indeed, I find it something of a misnomer to apply the pejorative term \u201cracial discrimination\u201d to a <em>failure </em>to make a charitable gift. One of the most inexplicable passages in the opinion is in footnote 17, where after noting the conclusion of the Peterson Commission that the \u201cnew rationale views foundations as more efficient than government in that foundations can be more flexible and more innovative than government\u201d because of \u201cbureaucratic or majoritarian constraints\u201d applicable to the latter, the opinion concludes that foundations should be subject to the same constraints applicable to government itself. Moreover, as already indicated, if the tax exemption makes this state action subject to judicial scrutiny to assure lack of discrimination, so must the tax deduction with respect to individual and corporate gifts. Donors are not going to be willing to spend their time and money, or to have directors and staffs of foundations spend theirs, in defending actions like this one. If the federal courts take over the supervision of philanthropy, there will ultimately be no philanthropy to supervise.</p>\n<p id=\"b704-4\">III.</p>\n<p id=\"b704-5\">As said at the outset, what makes the panel\u2019s opinion so peculiarly unfortunate is that the evil will in no way be eradicated by a finding on remand that the defendants have not engaged in discrimination. Despite this, the decision will spawn countless civil rights suits against charitable foundations by disgruntled minority applicants, add unnecessarily to the crushing burden on the district courts and the courts of appeals, and, worst of all, seriously discourage private philanthropy by subjecting donors to the necessity of justifying their decisions in court. Even an impeccable history of fairness will not protect against trials in actions by those who choose to think the inevitable turndowns were based on racial grounds. The record in this case suggests that several of the defendant foundations commendably have given liberally to black and other minority causes. None have any policy against such gifts. Those that are in the business of granting scholarships have granted them to blacks. But this record will not save these foundations, and many others in later suits, from the necessity of full factual exploration and explanation of just what they have done over the years, with the attendant burdens on foundation directors and staffs and the courts.</p>\n<p id=\"b704-7\">Doubtless because of their confidence in prevailing on the merits, the defendants did not seek certiorari from the per curiam decision of last December. Since this case has been continually <em>sub judice </em>by this court and the substituted decision seems to me to go even further down the state action road, it may not be too late to do this, see F.T.C. v. Colgate-Palmolive Co., 380 U.S. 374, 384, 85 S.Ct. 1035, 13 L.Ed.2d 904 (1965). And although the Supreme Court does not generally grant certiorari with respect to non-final judgments of the courts of appeals, it does so when convinced that \u201cthere is some important and clear-cut issue of law that is fundamental to the further conduct of the case and that would otherwise qualify as a basis for certiorari,\u201d see Stern &amp; Gressman Supreme Court Practice, \u00a7 4.19 at 180-81 (4th ed. 1969), see Land v. Dollar, 330 U.S. 731, 734 n. 2, 67 S.Ct. 1009, 91 L. Ed; 1209 (1947), and Larson v. Domes<page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"641\">*641</page-number>tic &amp; Foreign Commerce Corp., 337 U.S. 682, 683 n. 3, 69 S.Ct. 1457, 93 L.Ed. 1628 (1949). It is to be hoped, in any event, that other circuits will not follow this disastrous course.</p>\n<p id=\"b705-6\">Judge Feinberg also dissents from the denial of reconsideration en banc.</p>\n<footnote label=\"1\">\n<p id=\"b701-7\">. Although the panel technically did not make a finding of government action as to the defendant foundations in this case, I cannot see how the district court can read the substituted opinion as leaving it any real leeway.</p>\n<p id=\"b701-8\">This dissent does not apply to the holding with resj)ect to the defendant Buffalo Foundation, which I agree falls within the principle of the Girard College decisions, Pennsylvania v. Board of Directors of City Trusts, 353 U.S. 230, <em>77 </em>S.Ct. 806, 1 L.Ed.2d 792 (1958), and Pennsylvania v. Brown, 392 F. 2d 120 (3 Cir.), cert. denied, 391 U.S. 921, 88 S.Ct. 1811, 20 L.Ed.2d 657 (1968).</p>\n</footnote>\n<footnote label=\"2\">\n<p id=\"b701-9\">. 'Significantly, the only one of these four cases cited in the per curiam to have been approved by the Supreme Court was Green v. Connally, 330 F.Supp. 1150 (D.D.C.), aff\u2019d mem. sub nom. Coit v. Green, 404 U.S. 997, 92 S.Ct. 564, 30 L.Ed.2d 550 (1971), which dealt with tax exemption for a lily-white Southern school and struck down the exemption on <em>statutory </em>grounds. The <em>Oreen </em>case is supported in its result, if not entirely in its reasoning, by Poindexter v. Louisiana Education Comm\u2019n for Needy Children, 296 F.Supp. 686 (E.D.La.), aff\u2019d mem., 393 U.S. 17, 89 S.Ct. 48, 21 L.Ed.2d 16 (1968), and Brown v.

Wagner College, 429 F.2d 1120 (2 Cir. 1970), without further proof that college administrators considered that a state statute required them to act <em>against </em>the plaintiffs. There could be no such finding with respect to the statutes regulating tax exemption for foundations.</p>\n</footnote>\n<footnote label=\"4\">\n<p id=\"b703-7\">. The panel attaches great weight to \u00a7 4945, added to the Code in 1969, and particularly the requirement, \u00a7 4945(d)(3), (g), that individual grants for \u201ctravel, study, or other similar purposes\u201d be awarded \u201con an objective and nondiscriminatory basis.\u201d As the legislative history and the regulations make clear, this provision was intended to bar the use of private foundations as a device to channel income to previously designated individuals or to unqualified persons whose receipt of foundation grants is suspiciously inconsistent with the putative purpose for which tax exemption is granted \u2014 in other words to prevent use of a foundation for gifts that would not be deductible if made by an individual or corporation. The \u201cobjective and nondiscriminatory\u201d requirement applies only among the members of the designated charitable class. As T.R. \u00a7 53.4945-44(b)(5) Example (2) illustrates, the statutory standard permits the charitable class to be composed of the members of a single ethnic group so long as the purpose of the program is legitimate. Indeed the panel properly concedes \u201cThere is no evidence to the effect that Congress sought to prevent foundations from choosing on the basis of race between two public uses of foundation assets.\u201d In any event this provision could not support a holding of government action with respect to foundation grants to other than individuals.</p>\n</footnote>\n</opinion>\n</casebody>\n",
