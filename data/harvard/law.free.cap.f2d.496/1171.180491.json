Although the complaint contained no averments against the Union, the motion was granted. Thirty days were allowed for the filing of an amended complaint. The amended complaint was likewise dismissed for failure to join the Union as previously ordered by the Court. The record, however, is bereft of any indication that the second dismissal was entered as a sanction for failure to comply with the prior order.</p>\n<p id=\"b1236-16\">In the absence of such an indication, and considering that the complaint prayed for no relief against the Union, we are of the opinion that neither the first nor the second orders of dismissal should have been entered.</p>\n<p id=\"b1236-17\">Accordingly, we reverse the judgment of the District Court and remand the case for further proceedings.</p>\n<p id=\"b1236-18\">Reversed and remanded.</p>\n</opinion>\n</casebody>\n",
