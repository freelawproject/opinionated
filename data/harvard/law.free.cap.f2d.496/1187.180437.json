By order dated September 27, 1973 the district court held, and we think correctly so, that the \u201caveraging method\u201d <footnotemark>1</footnotemark> employed by the defendants in determining income when unpredictable court ordered child support was received by recipients of Aid to Families with Dependent Children conflicted with federal <em>regulations</em><footnotemark><em>2</em></footnotemark><em> </em>and was invalid. Retroactive injunctive relief and financial assistance to members of plaintiffs\u2019 class was denied. With this we also agree. Edelman v. Jordan, 1974, 415 U.S. 651, 94 S.Ct. 1347, 39 L.Ed.2d 662 [42 U.S.L.W. 4419].</p>\n<p id=\"b1252-18\">Prior to entry of final judgment the Georgia General Assembly enacted the Child Support Recovery Act, Title 99 \u00a7 901b et seq., which removed the plaintiffs\u2019 and the class they represent from the operation of the averaging regulations, and the Act was implemented with respect to the plaintiffs.</p>\n<p id=\"b1252-19\">We affirm the district court\u2019s denial of retroactive injunctive relief and financial assistance to members of plaintiffs\u2019 class.<footnotemark>3</footnotemark> The judgment enjoining the enforcement of the child support averaging policy, now superceded by the Child Support Recovery Act, is vacated and the case is remanded to the district court with directions to dismiss that portion of the proceedings as moot.</p>\n<p id=\"b1252-20\">Affirmed in part, vacated in part, remanded with directions.</p>\n<footnote label=\"1\">\n<p id=\"b1252-13\">. The Child Support Averaging policy, Part III, \u00a7 VII p. 9 of the State Plan for AFDC provides in pertinent part that \u201cwhen income is unpredictable, the previous year\u2019s income (6 months in AFDC) may be used to determine monthly income.\u201d</p>\n</footnote>\n<footnote label=\"2\">\n<p id=\"b1252-21\">. 45 C.F.R. \u00a7 233.20(a) (3) (ii)(c).</p>\n</footnote>\n<footnote label=\"3\">\n<p id=\"b1252-22\">.
