Herman Olin WELCH, Appellant.</parties>\n<docketnumber data-order=\"1\" data-type=\"docketnumber\" id=\"b925-8\">No. 73-2041.</docketnumber>\n<court data-order=\"2\" data-type=\"court\" id=\"b925-9\">United States Court of Appeals, Fourth Circuit.</court>\n<otherdate data-order=\"3\" data-type=\"otherdate\" id=\"b925-10\">Argued Feb. 4, 1974.</otherdate>\n<decisiondate data-order=\"4\" data-type=\"decisiondate\" id=\"b925-11\">Decided April 23, 1974.</decisiondate>\n<attorneys data-order=\"5\" data-type=\"attorneys\" id=\"b925-16\">Thomas E. Smith, Jr., Pamplico, S. C. [Court-appointed counsel], and E. LeRoy Nettles, Lake City, S. C. (Nettles, Thorny, Floyd, &amp; Smith, Lake City, S. C., on brief) for appellant.</attorneys>\n<attorneys data-order=\"6\" data-type=\"attorneys\" id=\"b925-18\">Marvin L. Smith, Asst. U. S. Atty. (John K. Grisso, U. S. Atty., on brief) for appellee.</attorneys>\n<p data-order=\"7\" data-type=\"judges\" id=\"b925-19\">Before BRYAN, Senior Circuit Judge, and WINTER and BUTZNER, Circuit Judges.</p>\n<opinion data-order=\"8\" data-type=\"opinion\" id=\"x999-1\" type=\"majority\">\n<author id=\"b925-20\">PER CURIAM:</author>\n<p id=\"b925-21\">Appellant Herman Olin Welch protests that he was prejudiced because of an experiment the jury initiated and conducted during its deliberations and so his bank robbery conviction, 18 U.S.C. \u00a7 2113, should be vacated. One member produced a roll of adhesive tape, like that allegedly used by the defendant as a partial disguise in the holdup, while another juror simulated its use.</p>\n<p id=\"b925-22\">On defendant\u2019s motion for a new trial the District Judge, sensitive of the attaintment of a verdict by the injection into the jury room of proof dehors the record, declared the rehearsal to be misconduct and an error in trial. United States v. Beach, 296 F.2d 153, 158 (4 Cir. 1961); Cf. United States v. Hephner, 410 F.2d 930, 936 (7 Cir. 1969). Further, however, he appraised it as harmless beyond a reasonable doubt. See Chapman v. California, 386 U.S. 18, 87 S.Ct. 824, 17 L.Ed.2d 705 (1967).</p>\n<p id=\"b925-23\">In his assessment, the Judge cautiously assayed the evidence, both in its detail and in its entirety, and found )Yelch overwhelmed in guilt. These conclusions were accurate applications of authentic measures. Chapman v. California, supra, p. 22, 87 S.Ct. 824.</p>\n<p id=\"b925-24\">Upon consideration of the record and argument of counsel, orally and on brief, we find appellant\u2019s assignments of error meritless, and affirm his conviction on the opinion of the District Judge. United States v. Welch, 377 F.Supp. 367 (1973).</p>\n<p id=\"b925-25\">Affirmed.</p>\n</opinion>\n</casebody>\n",
