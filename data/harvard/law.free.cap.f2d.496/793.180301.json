Steigler was convicted in the Superior Court of Delaware on three counts of first degree murder and one count of assault with intent to commit murder in connection with a fire in the home of appellant on October 19, 1968. On appeal, the Delaware Supreme Court affirmed the conviction. Steigler v. State, 277 A.2d 662 (1971). Appellant filed a petition for a writ of certiorari, and in a brief order, the Supreme Court vacated appellant\u2019s dealth penalty. Steigler v. Delaware, 408 U.S. 939, 92 S.Ct. 2872, 33 L.Ed.2d 760, <em>citing </em>Stewart v. Massachusetts, 408 U.S. 845, 92 S.Ct. 2845, 33 L.Ed.2d 744 (1972). Proceeding <em>in forma, pauperis, </em>appellant petitioned the United States District Court for the District of Delaware for a writ of habeas corpus. The district court denied the petition and we affirm, 360 F.Supp. 1286.</p>\n<p id=\"b858-22\">In the early morning hours of October 19, 1968, fire erupted at appellant\u2019s home in Deerhurst, New Castle County, Delaware. Appellant\u2019s wife summoned the aid of a nearby fire company which responded promptly and brought the fire under control, but not before appellant\u2019s daughter, mother-in-law and father-in-law had died. During the course of ex-<page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"795\">*795</page-number>languishing the blaze, attempting to rescue persons trapped in the house, securing the premises and investigating for the causes of the fire, various firemen, including Deputy Fire Marshall Richard Lynch, discovered several items of physical evidence of arson. Openly situated throughout the house were numerous glass containers, some broken and some filled with gasoline. Sections of the rug upon which several of the containers had been placed were soaked with gasoline. Surmising from this and other evidence that the fire was the result of arson, and having assisted in removing at least one corpse, Lynch pl\u00e1ced a call to the New Castle County Fireboard requesting that the Delaware State Police be dispatched to the scene. Shortly thereafter Sgt. Daniel Bramble of the Delaware State Police and several of his colleagues arrived and, without a warrant, proceeded to remove the physical evidence of arson discovered by Lynch and the various firemen. The police also took pictures of some of this evidence and the surrounding area from which they were removed. These photos and physical evidence were admitted into evidence at trial over appellant\u2019s objection. Appellant contends that since the police did not obtain a search warrant, his rights under the fourth amendment were violated and hence the evidence in question was inadmissible.</p>\n<p id=\"b859-5\">Sgt. Bramble of the Delaware State Police interviewed appellant on four separate occasions between October 19 (morning of the fire) and October 24, before charging him with arson and murder. On none of these occasions was appellant informed of his <em>Miranda </em>rights, which appellant contends violated his fifth amendment rights.</p>\n<p id=\"b859-7\">EVIDENCE SEIZED WITHOUT A SEARCH WARRANT</p>\n<p id=\"b859-8\">While searches and seizures must generally be undertaken by state officials only after obtaining a search warrant,<footnotemark>1</footnotemark> the Supreme Court has recognized a number of situations in which a warrantless search may be lawful.<footnotemark>2</footnotemark> In each of these situations the Supreme Court found exigent circumstances rendering imperative official action without first obtaining a warrant. We believe a similar situation existed in the present case.</p>\n<p id=\"b859-9\">Although it is not clear whether appellant concedes this, we think it is beyond\u2019question that firemen have a right to enter a premise to suppress a fire without having to obtain a warrant.<footnotemark>3</footnotemark> We simply do not think that a \u201csearch\u201d in the fourth amendment sense occurs when firemen enter a burning home to suppress a fire.<footnotemark>4</footnotemark> Moreover, seeking out and rescuing trapped occupants, ventilating the building after the fire is brought under control, searching for any smoldering fires and cleaning up prior to departing all involve proper fire fighting functions which cannot reasonably be viewed\u2019 as searches under the fourth amendment.</p>\n<p id=\"b859-10\">In any event, even if such actions of firemen were searches under the fourth amendment, we think no war<page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"796\">*796</page-number>rant was required since a more exigent circumstance is difficult to imagine.<footnotemark>5</footnotemark> We think it readily follows from this that any evidence of arson seen by firemen in plain view while performing these functions may be seized without first obtaining a warrant. <em>See e. g., </em>Coolidge v. New Hampshire, 403 U.S. 443, 464-473, 91 S.Ct. 2022, 29 L.Ed.2d 564 (1971); Harris v. United States, 390 U.S. 234, 236, 88 S.Ct. 992, 19 L.Ed.2d 1067 (1968); Ker v. California, 374 U.S. 23, 42-43, 83 S.Ct. 1623, 10 L.Ed.2d 726 (1963).</p>\n<p id=\"b860-4\">Not all of the evidence objected to by appellant, however, was seen by the firemen during the course of rescuing trapped occupants, suppressing the fire and securing the premises. Some of the evidence was found while Lynch conducted his investigation into the cause the fire.<footnotemark>6</footnotemark></p>\n<p id=\"b860-5\">Although Lynch was authorized by statute to investigate \u201cthe origin or circumstances\u201d<footnotemark>7</footnotemark> of any fire in Delaware, we recognize this does not necessarily end our inquiry. Regardless of state authority, the acts of state offici\u00e1is are judged by federal standards when fourth amendment violations are claimed. <em>E. g., </em>Elkins v. United States, 364 U.S. 206, 223, 80 S.Ct. 1437, 4 L.Ed.2d 1669 (1960). Thus, even though Lynch had authority under state law to investigate the cause of the fire, the question remains whether the fourth amendment required that he first obtain a search warrant.</p>\n<p id=\"b860-11\">Appellant relies heavily on the companion cases of Camara v. Municipal Court, 387 U.S. 523, 87 S.Ct. 1727, 18 L.Ed.2d 930 (1967) and See v. Seattle, 387 U.S. 541, 87 S.Ct. 1737, 18 L.Ed.2d 943 (1967), in which the Supreme Court held that the fourth amendment forbids warrantless area inspections for violations of municipal housing and business code provisions. We are not faced, however, with the situation of a fire mar-shall inspecting a home for violations of fire code provisions. Nor are we faced with the situation (and therefore we express no opinion as to the validity) of a fire marshall investigating, without a warrant, the cause of a fire several hours or days after the fire.<footnotemark>8</footnotemark></p>\n<p id=\"b861-4\"><page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"797\">*797</page-number>The present situation is markedly different. Here there was an emergency situation which <em>Camara </em>explicitly exempted from its warrant requirement.<footnotemark>9</footnotemark> Unlike <em>Camara, </em>there was a \u201ccompelling urgency [for Lynch] to inspect at a particular time [and] on a particular day.\u201d<footnotemark>10</footnotemark> The need to investigate promptly for the cause of the fire is very much interrelated with the necessity of suppressing the blaze. The rationale for dispensing with a warrant in such situations has been cogently summarized by the Fifth Circuit in United States v. Green:</p>\n<blockquote id=\"b861-5\">\u201cUnlike the area inspection, which does not focus on a particular premises and is conducted without reference to knowledge of a fire hazard at a given location, the investigation of an actual fire is logically and factually inseparable from the fireman\u2019s job of suppressing the blaze. The ordinary fireman is not an expert in the cause of fires. He cannot determine, after he douses the blaze, whether the danger is past or merely hidden, awaiting only a fresh supply of oxygen to set it off again with perhaps disastrous results.</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b861-6\">\u201c\u00c1 fire might have been caused by any of a myriad of conditions that would not be terminated by simply putting out the flame \u2014 e. g., a faulty appliance, defective or worn out electrial wiring, or careless storage of flammable materials. Where the existence of a gravely dangerous condition has already manifested itself in one fire, it would be the height of folly for the firemen to enter, suppress the flames, and leave the premises without assurance that they would not be required to return, perhaps within minutes, to do it all again.</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b861-8\">\u201cCritical to the Supreme Court\u2019s imposition of the warrant requirement in <em>Camara </em>and in <em>See </em>was the recognition that there is nothing in the nature of a routine area inspection that requires immediate entry into a particular structure in the area at a specific time. There is, however, such a necessity in the case of a fire. Until someone expert in the cause of fires arrives, inspects the scene, and determines that the fire has been completely extinguished, the firemen cannot reasonably depart. The imposition of a warrant requirement in such circumstances would immobilize the entire apparatus of fire protection. The absurdity of requiring the fire investigator to secure a warrant in order to search for the fire\u2019s cause is self evident.\u201d<footnotemark>11</footnotemark></blockquote>\n<p id=\"b861-9\">We fully agree,<footnotemark>12</footnotemark> and thus conclude that Lynch\u2019s warrantless investigation during and immediately following the suppression of the fire was reasonable and justified by exigent circumstances.<footnotemark>13</footnotemark></p>\n<p id=\"b861-10\">Appellant nonetheless argues that Sgt. Bramble and the other police officers were required to obtain a warrant prior to seizing and removing the containers and other items discovered by Lynch and the other firemen. We do not agree. The purpose of the warrant requirement is to insure prior judicial authorization of intrusions into areas in which a person has a reasonable expectation of privacy.<footnotemark>14</footnotemark> When Lynch proceeded to investigate the cause of the fire he was <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"798\">*798</page-number>clothed with a law enforcement function similar to police,<footnotemark>15</footnotemark> and correspondingly, his actions were subjected to the restraints of the fourth amendment. But having determined that Lynch\u2019s warrantless discovery of evidence of arson was justified and valid under the fourth amendment, we think no greater invasion of privacy resulted when officers from another law enforcement agency (Bramble and the other policemen) subsequently entered and removed the evidence.<footnotemark>16</footnotemark> To require the police in such a situation to first obtain a warrant would be senseless, since it would further no recognizable fourth amendment interest. Appellant no longer had any reasonable expectation of privacy in the items discovered by Lynch during his investigation.<footnotemark>17</footnotemark></p>\n<p id=\"b862-4\">FAILURE TO GIVE MIRANDA WARNINGS</p>\n<p id=\"b862-5\">The question of when police are required to give <em>Miranda </em>warnings has been the source of much litigation and, as this Court has noted, must be approached on a case-by-case basis.<footnotemark>18</footnotemark> <em>Miranda </em>created a presumption of coercion whenever a defendant\u2019s statement is obtained through interrogation initiated by police after the defendant \u201chas been taken into custody or otherwise deprived of his freedom in any significant way.\u201d<footnotemark>19</footnotemark> This presumption of coercion is rebut-table by a showing that the defendant was given <em>Miranda </em>warnings and then waived his right to remain silent.<footnotemark>20</footnotemark> Since appellant was not given <em>Miranda </em>warnings prior to each of the four \u201cinterrogations\u201d in question,<footnotemark>21</footnotemark> the statements made by appellant on these occasions are inadmissible as evidence if they were the product of !\u2018eustodial interrogation.\u201d</p>\n<p id=\"b862-16\">This Court and other circuits have held that <em>Miranda </em>abandoned the \u201cfocus\u201d theory <footnotemark>22</footnotemark> in favor of the more objective test of whether the \u201cgovernment has in some meaningful way imposed restraint on [a person\u2019s] freedom of action.\u201d<footnotemark>23</footnotemark> In the absence of such restraint there simply does not exist the inherent pressures which <em>Miranda </em>warnings were intended to neutralize.<footnotemark>24</footnotemark></p>\n<p id=\"b862-17\">Applying this test of whether there has been significant restraint on freedom of action, the Supreme Court, in Orozco v. Texas, 394 U.S. 324, 89 S.Ct. 1095, 22 L.Ed.2d 311 (1969), erased any doubt that custodial interrogation may occur outside the police station.<footnotemark>25</footnotemark> <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"799\">*799</page-number>Equally beyond doubt is that custodial interrogation does not necessarily ensue merely because police questioning occurred at a police station.<footnotemark>26</footnotemark> (At least two of the police interviews at issue here took place in a police station.) We emphasize, however, that all \u201cstation-house\u201d interrogations should be scrutinized with extreme care for any taint of psychological compulsion or intimidation because such pressure is most apt to exist while a defendant is interviewed at a police station.</p>\n<p id=\"b863-5\">We recognize, of course, what this Court has perceived before: that \u201c[a]n exact definition for \u2018custodial interrogation\u2019 is, by its nature, an impossibility.\u201d<footnotemark>27</footnotemark> The Second Circuit, though, has perceptively analyzed the factors which must be considered in determining whether there has been a custodial interrogation:</p>\n<blockquote id=\"b863-6\">\u201cClearly the [Supreme] Court meant that <em>something </em>more than official interrogation must be shown. It is hard to suppose that suspicion alone was thought to constitute that something; almost all official interrogation of persons who later become criminal defendants stems from that very source. While the Court\u2019s language in <em>Miranda </em>was imprecise, doubtless deliberately so, it conveys a flavor of some affirmative action by the authorities other than police interrogation. This view is strengthened by the passage<footnotemark>28</footnotemark> at 384 U.S. 478, 86 S.Ct. 1630, where the Chief Justice, after referring to \u2018the compelling atmosphere inherent in the process of in-custody interrogation\u2019 and just before a second and slightly altered affirmation of the test, inserted a footnote reading:</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b863-13\">&lt;46 The distinction and its significance has been aptly described in the opinion of a Scottish court:</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b863-14\">\u2018In former times such questioning, if undertaken, would be conducted by police officers visiting the house or place of business of the suspect and there questioning him, probably in the presence of a relation or friend. However convenient the modern practice [of interrogation at the police station] may be, it must normally create a situation very unfavourable to the suspect.\u2019 Chalmers v. H. M. Advocate [1954], Sess.Cas. 66, 78 (J. C.).</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b863-15\">\u201cEven without the light of <em>Orozco </em>we would not have thought this to mean that questioning in the home could never come within the mandate of <em>Miranda; </em>we do think it suggests that in the absence of actual arrest something must be said or done by the authorities, either in their manner of approach or in the tone or extent of their questioning, which indicates that they would not have heeded a request to depart or to allow the suspect to do so. This is not to say that the amount of information possessed by the police, and the consequent acuity of their \u2018focus,\u2019 is irrelevant. The more cause for believing the suspect committed the crime, the greater the tendency to bear down in interrogation and to create the kind of atmosphere of significant restraint that triggers' <em>Miranda, </em>and <em>vice versa. </em><page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"800\">*800</page-number>But this is simply one circumstance, to be weighed with all the others.\u201d*<footnotemark>29</footnotemark></blockquote>\n<p id=\"b864-5\">With these principles in mind, we have reviewed the record and, after considering appellant\u2019s contentions, conclude that the district court committed no error in holding that none of the four interviews in question involved a custodial interrogation. The district court, after thorough consideration of all the facts, found as follows:</p>\n<p id=\"b864-6\">\u201c(1) There was a complete absence of restraint of petitioner\u2019s liberty ; for instance, on October 24th, Bramble spoke with him briefly at his (petitioner\u2019s) office;</p>\n<p id=\"b864-7\">\u201c(2) The interrogations were routine and courteous in character;</p>\n<p id=\"b864-8\">\u201c(3) There is no evidence that the investigation had \u2018focused\u2019 on petitioner. The evidence that police were quietly \u2018shadowing\u2019 the petitioner\u2019s family against the possibility of harm at the funeral is significant in that respect. Moreover, other suspects and persons were being interviewed and the physical evidence had not been returned by the F.B.I. \u25a0 Thus, the progress of the investigation was not in any final stage;</p>\n<p id=\"b864-9\">\u201c(4) Petitioner was a young and intelligent man, a college graduate and not to be easily cowed or intimidated by police presence;</p>\n<p id=\"b864-10\">\u201c(5) The times of the interrogations seemed to be reasonable, subject to petitioner\u2019s convenience and not unduly prolonged.\u201d 360 F.Supp. at 1291.</p>\n<p id=\"b864-11\">In these circumstances, <em>Miranda </em>warnings were not required.</p>\n<p id=\"b864-12\">Lastly, appellant argues that his conviction was based, at least in part, on perjured police testimony which renders his conviction void. We find no merit in this contention. The district court did not err in finding that appellant had failed to show that perjury had been committed and hence, that he had been deprived of due process.</p>\n<p id=\"b864-14\">The order of the district court of July 3, 1973, will be affirmed.</p>\n<footnote label=\"1\">\n<p id=\"b859-11\">. <em>E. g., </em>Coolidge v.

Appellant has quite properly not challenged on this appeal the finding of the district court that nothing significant was removed by the police other than what had already been noticed by the various firemen and Lynch. 360 F.Supp. at 1295. A container found by the police in a neighbor\u2019s yard was admitted into evidence, but appellant has no standing to raise a fourth amendment claim with respect to that item. <em>See e. g., </em>Jones v. United States, 362 U.S. 257, 80 S.Ct. 725, 4 L.Ed.2d 697 (1960). Although it is not entirely clear from the record, the police may have seized three items which had not been previously noticed by the firemen or Lynch. Even assuming arguendo that these items \u2014 a container in the garage, a screen through which Mrs. Steigler escaped and four burnt matches \u2014 were impermissibly seized without a warrant, their admission into evidence, as implicitly suggested by the district court, was clearly harmless beyond a reasonable doubt.</p>\n</footnote>\n<footnote label=\"7\">\n<p id=\"b860-13\">.
