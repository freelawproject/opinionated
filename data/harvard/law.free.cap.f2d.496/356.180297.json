In United States v. Broyles, 423 F.2d 1299 (4th Cir. 1970), we held that when a registrant establishes a prima facie case for classification as a conscientious objector, the local board must disclose why it rejected the registrant\u2019s claim.<footnotemark>1</footnotemark> Disclosure of the reasons for the board\u2019s decision, we concluded, was essential to effective judicial review. We now hold that the local board\u2019s failure to state the basis of its decision casts such a flaw on administrative review that the omission cannot be remedied by the appeal board\u2019s statement of its reasons for denying the claim. Accordingly, we find the order of induction to be invalid and reverse the conviction of John Charles Wainscott for refusing to submit to induction.</p>\n<p id=\"b421-9\">I</p>\n<p id=\"b421-10\">Wainscott registered with the Selective Service System- on July 21, 1966, and was given a student, II-S, classification six months later. After receiving a series of student deferments, his II-S classification expired on October 15, 1969. On January 5,1970, he was reclassified available for induction, I-A, and on January 15 was informed of his right to a personal appearance before his local board and his right to appeal, neither of which he exercised. After undergoing a physical examination on February 13, he was notified on March 9 that he was acceptable for service. A month later he requested SSS Form No. 150 for conscientious objectors, which he submitted on May 8.</p>\n<p id=\"b421-14\">In his conscientious objector questionnaire, Wainscott described his religious beliefs as follows:</p>\n<blockquote id=\"b421-15\">\u201cI believe that to harm or destory any human being is to endanger any hope for peace; more important, it is morally unpardonable and, for me, impossible. Therefore I cannot and will not participate in any form of combat. This is a fundamental part of my entire moral code.\u201d</blockquote>\n<p id=\"b421-16\">In response to a question concerning the source of his religious beliefs, he replied:</p>\n<blockquote id=\"b421-17\">\u201cI began thinking along these lines at the age of 13 or 14 when, after studying and discussing various religious aspects, I reasoned that man \u2014 not a supreme being \u2014 controls his own actions. Thus it was apparent that with no god and no fate, man must himself maintain peace, and to do so he must not destroy any fellow man. Any action against another human being endangers any hope for peace and is therefore unpardonable. Aside from my own private thinking, I was influenced toward this decision by discussions with many people and by read<page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"358\">*358</page-number>ing such works as the Bible, the Bhagavad Gita, and readings from Ghandi.\u201d</blockquote>\n<p id=\"b422-4\">To the question, \u201cTo what extent does your religious training and belief restrict you from ministering to the sick and injured, either civilian or military, or from serving in the Armed Forces as a noncombatant without weapons ?\u201d Wainscott replied:</p>\n<blockquote id=\"b422-5\">\u201cI have never been opposed to helping another human being. A noncombatant position would not be in opposition to my beliefs \u2014 provided that it would be truly noncombatant in every sense of the term.\u201d</blockquote>\n<p id=\"b422-6\">He noted that he had expressed his views to acquaintances and that he had started a thesis on the subject while attending college. He also submitted letters from his parents and two other persons attesting to the nature and sincerity of his beliefs.</p>\n<p id=\"b422-7\">Shortly after Wainscott applied for classification as a conscientious objector, the board requested an interview. From the executive secretary\u2019s notes it appears that when a member of the board observed that Wainscott was requesting noncombat status, Wainscott replied that he must have made a mistake as he thought noncombat meant no service at all. Asked when the change in status occurred, he stated no change had occurred \u2014 that he didn\u2019t read the forms very carefully and that the statement he made with regard to serving as a noncombatant meant no service of any kind.</p>\n<p id=\"b422-8\">With respect to Wainscott\u2019s religious beliefs, the secretary\u2019s notes reflect that he claimed no strong religious background and added that he thought religion was just a code of ethics; that he does not believe there is a Supreme Being, and that in order to prevent chaos you should treat people as you want them to treat you. He added that the worst thing to do to start chaos was killing and that he couldn\u2019t conceive of killing. He reiterated that he thought it was morally wrong to go to war. This, he said, involved a personal code. On being questioned about his conclusion that there was no \u201chereafter,\u201d he stated that he started to think about this when he was twelve and he came to the conclusion when he was' about eighteen or nineteen years of age. He acknowledged that he did not attend church now, although formerly he did.</p>\n<p id=\"b422-11\">During the interview, he ascribed his delay in filing his application to advice from friends that he need not seek classification as a conscientious objector when he held a II-S deferment. When the board sought to plumb the depth of his beliefs by confronting him with the alternative of induction or jail, he stated that he guessed it would have to be jail.</p>\n<p id=\"b422-12\">Without stating its reasons, the board refused to classify Wainscott as a conscientious objector. Wainscott filed an administrative appeal, which was denied with the following statement:</p>\n<blockquote id=\"b422-13\">\u201cThis appeal board is of the opinion that the record shows registrant\u2019s beliefs lack sufficient sincerity to constitute the necessary elements of conscientious objection. Attention is invited to conflicts in statements by registrant to the record. Accordingly, he is continued in Class I-A.\u201d<footnotemark>2</footnotemark></blockquote>\n<p id=\"b422-14\">After Wainscott refused to be inducted into the army, he was convicted of violating 50 U.S.C. App. \u00a7 462 (1972). On appeal, his principal assignment of error is that the failure of the local board to disclose the reasons for rejecting his claim invalidated the underlying order of induction. A panel of this court, assuming that Wainscott had presented a prima facie case for conscientious objection and. deeming a statement of the appeal board\u2019s decision sufficient to validate the order, held that there was a basis in fact for Wainscott\u2019s classification and affirmed his conviction. We granted rehearing in banc <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"359\">*359</page-number>principally to consider whether the appeal board\u2019s statement remedied the local board\u2019s silence.</p>\n<p id=\"b423-5\">II</p>\n<p id=\"b423-6\">The government, pointing out that an appeal board can classify <em>de novo, </em>argues that an appeal board\u2019s statement of reasons for the registrant\u2019s classification is sufficient to enable a court to review the registrant\u2019s claim. This contention, however, addresses only the necessity of an adequate record for judicial review. It overlooks the important function of administrative review.</p>\n<p id=\"b423-7\">Judicial review of selective service classifications is extremely limited. If the board\u2019s order has a basis in fact, it must be sustained. 50 U.S.C. \u00a7 460(b)(3) (1972); Estep v. United States, 327 U.S. 114, 122, 66 S.Ct. 423, 90 L.Ed. 567 (1946). On the other hand, an appeal board is not so narrowly restricted. It can classify anew. 50 U.S.C. \u00a7 460(b)(3) (1972); 32 C.F.R. \u00a7 1626.4(h) (1973); United States v. Verbeek, 423 F.2d 667, 668 (9th Cir. 1970). The fair operation of the system, therefore, depends in no small part on \u201cthe opportunity for full administrative review.\u201d Mulloy v. United States, 398 U. S. 410, 416, 90 S.Ct. 1766, 1771, 26 L.Ed.2d 362 (1970). Recognizing that in the usual case an appeal board\u2019s classification is final, the Supreme Court held under procedures formerly in effect, that a registrant was entitled to a copy of the Department of Justice\u2019s recommendation so he could effectively present his case to the appeal board. Gonzales v. United States, 348 U.S. 407, 75 S.Ct. 409, 99 L.Ed. 467 (1955).</p>\n<p id=\"b423-12\">Although the Department of Justice no longer presents its recommendation in conscientious objector appeals, the need for the registrant to know the basis of the ruling against him has not lessened. Under regulations in effect at the time of Wainscott\u2019s appeal, a registrant could submit a written statement \u201cspecifying the matters in which he believes the local board erred.\u201d<footnotemark>3</footnotemark> Without being informed of the local board\u2019s reasons for denying his claim, a registrant\u2019s opportunity for filing an effective statement on his administrative appeal has been aptly described as \u201cno more than a stab in the dark.\u201d United States v. Edwards, 450 F.2d 49, 52 (1st Cir. 1971). Furthermore, the local board\u2019s silence compels the appeal board to speculate about the basis of the local board\u2019s decision. This, too, impedes administrative review. <em>Cf. </em>Smith v. United States, 157 F.2d 176, 182 (4th Cir. 1946) (dictum). In sum, the reasons that have persuaded a majority of the courts of appeals to require local boards to articulate the basis of their decisions for the purpose of facilitating judicial review apply as cogently to administrative review. <em>See </em>United States v. Speicher, 439 F.2d 104, 108 (3d Cir. 1971).</p>\n<p id=\"b423-13\">Although the Supreme Court has not expressly decided the issue before us, it vacated a judgment of conviction in Lenhard v. United States, 405 U.S. 1013, 92 S.Ct. 1296, 31 L.Ed.2d 477 (1972), and remanded the case for consideration in the light of a memorandum of the Solicitor General that addressed the problem.<footnotemark>4</footnotemark> Lenhard\u2019s local board never disclosed its reasons for denying his classification as a conscientious objector to the appeal <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"360\">*360</page-number>board. However, his conviction was affirmed by the court of appeals after the local board ultimately disclosed its reasons to the district court. In response to the petition for certiorari, the Solicitor General informed the Court that in his opinion the failure of the local board to disclose its reasons to the appeal board had denied Lenhard effective administrative review. The Court then vacated the judgment, and the court of appeals reversed the conviction. The factual aspects of <em>Lenhard </em>differ, but the principles expressed by the Solicitor General are fully applicable to Wainscott\u2019s case.</p>\n<p id=\"b424-4\">We conclude, therefore, that the failure of a local board to state why it rejected a registrant\u2019s prima facie claim denies the registrant the opportunity for full administrative review. This procedural defect is of sufficient importance to invalidate the order of induction notwithstanding the appeal board\u2019s assignment of reasons for its rejection of the claim.</p>\n<p id=\"b424-12\">III</p>\n<p id=\"b424-13\">Until the passage of the Draft Extension Act of 1971, a local board did not need to articulate its reasons for denying a registrant\u2019s claim unless the registrant proved a prima facie entitlement to the classification he sought.<footnotemark>5</footnotemark> Relying on the pre-1971 rule, the government contends that the silence of the local board is of no import because Wainscott did not prove a prima facie case. He does not meet the statutory qualifications, the government says, because his emphasis on peace evidences a political, not a religious, basis for his objection to war.<footnotemark>6</footnotemark></p>\n<p id=\"b424-14\">We cannot ascribe such a narrow interpretation to Wainscott\u2019s beliefs. The search for peace is not universally deemed to be a peculiarly secular venture. Moreover, one who is morally opposed to war is quite likely to express his belief affirmatively by using the antonym of war, which is peace. Wainscott, however, does not rest his opposition to war on his hope for peace. More important than this hope, he avers, is <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"361\">*361</page-number>his conviction that destruction of human life is \u201cmorally unpardonable.\u201d Wainscott\u2019s opposition to war is neither equivocal nor selective. His disavowal of belief in God and immortality does not disqualify him.<footnotemark>7</footnotemark> Describing the nature of his belief, he wrote his local board:</p>\n<blockquote id=\"b425-5\">\u201cI believe that to harm or destroy any human being is to endanger any hope for peace; more important, it is morally unpardonable and, for me, impossible. Therefore I cannot and will not participate in any form of combat. This is a fundamental part of my entire moral code.\u201d</blockquote>\n<p id=\"b425-6\">United States v. Seegar, 380 U.S. 163, 85 S.Ct. 850, 13 L.Ed.2d 733 (1965), prescribes a means for determining whether a registrant\u2019s beliefs are religious within the meaning of the Act:</p>\n<blockquote id=\"b425-7\">\u201cThe test might be stated in these words: A sincere and meaningful belief which occupies in the life of its possessor a place parallel to that filled by the God of those admittedly qualifying for the exemption comes within the statutory definition.\u201d 380 U.S. at 176, 85 S.Ct. at 859.</blockquote>\n<p id=\"b425-8\">In Welsh v. United States, 398 U.S. 333, 90 S.Ct. 1792, 26 L.Ed.2d 308 (1970), the Court was called upon to apply this test to a registrant who had struck from his application the statement that his belief was based on \u201creligious training,\u201d but who nevertheless had affirmed that he believed killing was morally wrong. The Court reversed Welsh\u2019s conviction and, amplifying <em>Seegar, </em>said:</p>\n<blockquote id=\"b425-9\">\u201cWhat is necessary under <em>Seegar </em>for a registrant\u2019s conscientous objection to all war to be \u2018religious\u2019 within the meaning of \u00a7 6(j) is that this opposition to war stem from the registrant\u2019s moral, ethical, or religious beliefs about what is right and wrong and that these beliefs be held with the strength of traditional religious convictions.\u201d 398 U.S. at 339, 90 S.Ct. at 1796.</blockquote>\n<p id=\"b425-15\">Wainscott\u2019s statement that the destruction of a human being is \u201cmorally unpardonable\u201d affirms that he believes the taking of human life is morally wrong. An act that is \u201cmorally unpardonable\u201d is indeed an ultimate moral wrong. His assertion that such an act is \u201cimpossible\u201d for him to perform is consistent with his resolution to accept jail rather than induction. Wainscott\u2019s acknowledgment that his belief involves a personal code does not disqualify him. <em>Welsh </em>requires us to equate a personal moral code with a religious belief if the \u201cindividual deeply and sincerely holds beliefs that are purely ethical or moral in source and content but that nevertheless impose upon him a duty of conscience to refrain from participating in any war at any time . . . .\u201d 398 U.S. at 340, 90 S.Ct. at 1796. Wainscott\u2019s beliefs accord, therefore, with the tests prescribed by <em>Seegar </em>and <em>Welsh.</em></p>\n<p id=\"b425-17\"> Finally, as <em>Welsh, </em>398 U.S. at 342, 90 S.Ct. 1792 also explains, a registrant is not ineligible for classification as a conscientious objector if, in addition to beliefs which qualify under the statute, he expresses his views on political affairs. Therefore, even if Wainscott\u2019s discussion of peace discloses a desire for an absence of war in the political sense, as the government suggests, he has nevertheless established a prima facie case for exemption.<footnotemark>8</footnotemark></p>\n<p id=\"b426-3\"><page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"362\">*362</page-number>The appeal board, apparently satisfied with the nature of Wainscott\u2019s beliefs, disqualified him because he lacked \u201csufficient sincerity.\u201d It premised this conclusion on unspecified conflicts in his statements. In the absence of any indication of the statements which the appeal board considered inconsistent, the government suggests that Wainscott\u2019s position on noncombatant service depicts his insincerity. In his application, Wainscott wrote \u201ca noncombatant position would not be in opposition to my beliefs \u2014 provided that it would be truly noneombatant in every sense of the term.\u201d However, at his personal appearance, he stated that he was not requesting noncombatant status. Queried, he explained that he must have made a mistake as he thought noncombat meant no service at all.</p>\n<p id=\"b426-4\">To support its charge of insincerity, the government relies on Witmer v. United States, 348 U.S. 375, 382, 75 S. Ct. 392, 99 L.Ed. 428 (1955), where the Court, in rejecting a claim for classification as a conscientious objector said:</p>\n<blockquote id=\"AWx\">\u201c[Ijnconsistent statements in themselves cast considerable doubt on the sincerity of petitioner\u2019s claim . it goes to his sincerity and honesty in claiming conscientious objection to participation in war.\u201d</blockquote>\n<p id=\"b426-5\">In <em>Witmer, </em>however, the Court was not dealing with the elements of a prima facie case. The Department of Justice, acting under procedures then in existence, had given its reasons, including inconsistencies in the registrant\u2019s position, for recommending denial of the claim. Thus, the Court was concerned solely with determining whether there was a basis in fact for the board\u2019s decision.</p>\n<p id=\"b426-6\">Here, if the local board had specified the reasons why it rejected Wainscott\u2019s claim, the record might well present a basis in fact that would sustain its decision. But this is not the issue now before us. The difficulty with the government\u2019s position is that neither the registrant, the government, the appeal board, nor this court knows whether the local board considered Wainscott to be insincere. The board may have thought that he was sincere but misguided in the nature of his beliefs. We do not even know whether the local board considered his remarks about noncombatant service to be inconsistent. The board, noting his education, may have thought his explanation was not credible, that his remarks were inconsistent, and that he was therefore insincere. On the other hand, realizing that a noncombatant may be, according to one definition in common usage, \u201ca person who is not a combatant; a civilian in time of war,\u201d<footnotemark>9</footnotemark> the local board may have accepted his explanation that he was thinking of a noncombatant in terms different from those commonly used by the selective service system. Since Wainscott\u2019s remarks are susceptible of conflicting interpretations, we cannot rule as a matter of law that they destroy the prima facie case which he otherwise established. Whether his explanation was sincere or deceptive depends on the inferences that one draws from the facts. It was, however, the province of his local board, not the appeal board or the courts, initially to assay the facts and the inferences that reasonably \u2022 can be drawn from them. Regardless of how carefully this procedure was conducted, the local board\u2019s failure to articulate its finding frustrated review. Indeed, this is precisely the type of case to which Judge Winter referred in United States v. Broyles, 423 F.2d 1299, 1304 (4th Cir. 1970), when he said:</p>\n<blockquote id=\"b426-8\">\u201cWhere it is clear that a <em>prima facie </em>case was established, we conclude that in conscientious objector cases, it is essential to the validity of an order to report that the board st\u00e1te its basis of decision and the reasons therefor, i. e., whether it has found the registrant <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"363\">*363</page-number>incredible, or insincere, or of bad faith, and why.\u201d</blockquote>\n<p id=\"b427-6\">We conclude, therefore, that the board\u2019s order of induction was invalid and Wainscott\u2019s judgment of conviction must be reversed.</p>\n<footnote label=\"1\">\n<p id=\"b421-11\">.

BRYAN, Senior Circuit Judge</author>\n<p id=\"Aqb\">(dissenting):</p>\n<p id=\"b427-8\">I. I question the proposition laid out immediately and explicitly in the majority opinion as: \u201cThe local board\u2019s failure to state the basis of its decision casts such a flaw on administrative review that the omission cannot be remedied by the appeal board\u2019s statement of its reasons for denying the claim\u201d. Forthrightly, too, the opinion concedes that the Supreme Court has not decided the issue.</p>\n<p id=\"b427-9\">Reliance is rested by the majority upon inference from the remand of Joseph v. United States, 438 F.2d 1233 (3 Cir. 1973), 405 U.S. 1006, and United States v. Lenhard, 437 F.2d 936 (2 Cir. 1970), 405 U.S. 1013, 92 S.Ct. 1296, 31 L.Ed.2d 477 by the Supreme Court \u201cfor consideration\u201d on the Solicitor General\u2019s anatomizing memorandum, which is set out in United States v. Stewart, 478 F.2d 106, 112 (2 Cir. 1973). Also cited is United States v. Broyles, 423 F.2d 1299 (4 Cir. 1970, en banc). Interestingly, unlike the case at bar, in none of these precedents were <em>any </em>reasons given for the appeal board\u2019s decision. Nor did the Solicitor\u2019s memorandum refer to the weight to be accorded the opinion given on the review. Hence I do not feel presumptuous in engaging the majority\u2019s proposition.</p>\n<p id=\"b427-10\">To begin, the purpose of the appeal board is seemingly overlooked by the majority; indeed, it is treated as an impotent entity. Its predominant function is, of course, to scan the proceedings of the local boards for illegalities in the classification of registrants. 32 CFR \u00a7 1626.23 (1969 Supplement). It is tbie place for complaints of the local board\u2019s actions. Otherwise it would have no reason for being. To this end, the appeal board is empowered to classify or reclassify a registrant. Id. \u00a7 1626.26.</p>\n<p id=\"b427-13\">This power, in my judgment, authorized the appeal board to correct the local board\u2019s omission of its reasons for the classification of Wainscott by itself classifying him. Particularly is this so under the majority\u2019s view that the omission had the ultimate effect of nullifying the classification by the local board. Further indication of the breadth of the appeal board\u2019s remedial supervision of the first classification is found in \u00a7 1626.23, directing appeal boards to check carefully \u201cwhether the record is complete\u201d and, if necessary, to return the file to the local board for completion.</p>\n<p id=\"b427-14\">But Wainscott protests, and the majority holds, that the omission impairs his appeal right and thus vitiates the local level classification. The argument, first, is that absent reasons the appellant cannot counter the local\u2019s decision \u2014that the right of appeal is then no longer \u201cmeaningful\u201d (by now a fatigued adjective). Additionally, it is said that without knowledge of the reasons the appellant cannot exercise the privilege of attaching to his appeal a statement\u2014 important because he cannot appear in person \u2014 specifying wherein he believes the local board erred.</p>\n<p id=\"b427-15\">These assertions, though plausible, are not sound. Wainscott had intimately known <em>all </em>the material that went before the local board and the questions to be resolved. The entire case is made up of only a brief record, readily carried in mind. He clearly demonstrated he was perfectly capable of prosecuting his claim in that tribunal. Nothing not then known to him could be included by the appeal board in its consideration. It was forbidden by the regulations to go beyond what he had placed or knew was before the local board. Id. \u00a7 1626.24. As for his statement, it would necessarily embrace all the assertions he had already put in the record by letters or had said on occasion. He was, of course, altogether aware of his contentions from the very beginning and throughout. What the absence of reasons could <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"364\">*364</page-number>amount to in imagined circumstances is merely academic. It was an elementary and uncomplex proceeding and only by suppositions can a deprivation of rights or privileges be imposed upon it.</p>\n<p id=\"b428-4\">Finally, it is pressed that even if permissibly remedial, the appeal board\u2019s statement of reasons was insufficient. It said:</p>\n<blockquote id=\"b428-5\">\u201cThis Appeal Board is of the opinion that the Record shows registrant\u2019s beliefs lack sufficient sincerity to constitute the necessary elements of conscientious objection. Attention is invited to conflicts in statement by the registrant in the Record. Accordingly, he is continued in class I-A.\u201d</blockquote>\n<p id=\"b428-6\">For me this is a plain, understandable statement. Its entire content is reasons. All reasons embody some conclusions, but the board\u2019s summary cannot be denied legitimacy under the brand of \u201cconclusions\u201d. The suppositions advanced of what basis the board could possibly have used are nothing but imageries. There is no occasion for pondering the board\u2019s ratio decidendi; it speaks for itself. Such surmises are banished by the board\u2019s stark, bold, explicit characterization of Wainscott\u2019s claims. There is no doubt or equivocation about the conflicts. They are obviously comprised of the two outstanding contradictions in the administrative proceedings: The first was that (1) \u201cnon-combatant position would not be in opposition to my beliefs \u2014 provided that it would be truly non-combatant in every sense\u201d and (2) later that his principles would not permit of non-combatant service. I find no other conflicting <em>\u201cstatements\u201d. </em>Certainly the expositions of his religious beliefs, while uncommon, are not inconsistent inter se.</p>\n<p id=\"b428-8\">Criticism is directed to the quotations in our first opinion from Witmer v. United States, 348 U.S. 375, 75 S.Ct. 42, 99 L.Ed. 640 (1955), on the destructive impact of conflicting statements upon the sincerity of a registrant\u2019s candidacy for CO classification. The reproof is that the Supreme Court was speaking in a different context. However, its words read impressively on the present circumstances. At all events, they are credibility precepts of the Supreme Court, classic in any situation.</p>\n<p id=\"b428-10\">II. As the majority notes, in the original opinion the decision was conditioned on the assumption that Wainscott had tendered a prima facie case and, so assuming, the opinion concluded that the appeal board\u2019s finding that the registrant\u2019s beliefs lack sincerity was sufficient to justify denial of CO classification to him. Inasmuch as the majority now overrules this conclusion, complete consideration of this case requires exploration, as the majority does, of the assumption\u2019s correctness.</p>\n<p id=\"b428-11\">Section 6(j) of the Selective Service Act, 50 U.S.C.A. App. \u00a7 456(j), so far as pertinent here, provides:</p>\n<blockquote id=\"b428-12\">\u201cNothing contained in this title [sections 451, 453, 454, 455, 456 and 458-471 of this Appendix] shall be construed to require any person to be subject to combatant training and service in the armed forces of the United States who, by reason of religious training and belief, is conscientiously opposed to participation in war in any form. As used in this subsection, the term \u2018religious training and belief\u2019 does not include essentially political, sociological, or philosophical views, or a merely personal moral code <em>ff</em></blockquote>\n<p id=\"b428-14\">In regard to his conscientious objections to war, the majority recalls, Wainscott stated:</p>\n<blockquote id=\"b428-15\">\u201cI began thinking along these lines at the age of 13 or 14 when, after studying and discussing various religious aspects, I reasoned that man \u2014 not a supreme being \u2014 controls his own actions. Thus it was apparent that with no god and no fate, man must himself maintain <em>peace, </em>and to do so he must not destroy any fellow man. Any action against another human being endangers any hope for <em>peace </em>and is <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"365\">*365</page-number>\u2019 (Accent therefore unpardonable/ added.)</blockquote>\n<p id=\"b429-7\">In his interview with the board, he said \u201cthat he had no strong religious background and that he thought religion was just a code of ethics \u2014 he stated that he did not believe that there was a Supreme Being \u2014 and in order to prevent chaos that you should treat people as you wanted them to treat you \u2014 he stated that the worse thing to do to start chaos was killing \u2014 and that he couldn\u2019t conceive of killing\u201d.</p>\n<p id=\"b429-8\">Obviously, he did not hold any \u201creligious conviction\u201d as that phrase is traditionally used. The next inquiry is whether he claimed CO status on moral or ethical beliefs equivalent, for him, of a religion \u2014 a tenet of faith as strong as the guide of deity-worship in others. This equation is accepted in Welsh v. United States, 398 U.S. 333, 90 S.Ct. 1792, 26 L.Ed.2d 308 (1970), but that is not the present registrant\u2019s basic and dominant manifestation. His overriding motivation is the desire for peace. True, he believes that \u201cto harm or destroy any human being\u201d is \u201cmorally unpardonable and impossible\u201d for him. This creed rests, he avers, on the wish to help another human being.</p>\n<p id=\"b429-9\">His thesis is not an inward personal peace but, rather, public tranquility. Incidentally, in this connection, to repeat, at first he averred he would accept non-combatant service as not offending his beliefs \u2014 later he explained he meant by that no service at all. In my view his objection \u201crests solely upon considerations of policy\u201d which is not a basis for exemption. <em>Welsh, </em>supra, at 342-343, 90 S.Ct. at 1798. Consequently, I do not think he made out a prima facie case before the local board.</p>\n<p id=\"b429-10\">I would affirm the conviction.</p>\n<p id=\"b429-11\">WIDENER, Circuit Judge, joins in this dissent.</p>\n</opinion>\n</casebody>\n",
