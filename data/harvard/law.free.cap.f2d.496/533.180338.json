The case had originally been tried against Firestone and others before Walter Bruchhausen, <em>J., </em>and a jury, which was able to agree on only two of the several interrogatories submitted to it. As to these, the jury\u2019s response exonerated Firestone and was accepted by the judge as a verdict favorable to that defendant, although a mistrial was declared with respect to the remainder of the action.<footnotemark>1</footnotemark> Appellant argues to us that there was no proper jury verdict on his claims against Firestone and that he was denied the right to poll the jury. We have considered these contentions and find them without merit. Although there was much room for improvement in the way the jury verdict was taken, we conclude that substantial justice was done and that there was no reversible error.</p>\n<p id=\"b598-6\">Judgment affirmed.</p>\n<footnote label=\"1\">\n<p id=\"b598-7\">. The remaining claims were settled during a retrial before another judge.</p>\n</footnote>\n</opinion>\n</casebody>\n",
