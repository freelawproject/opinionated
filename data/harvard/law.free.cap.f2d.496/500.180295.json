Long $10,949 on his claim that his discharge from Ford was racially discriminatory in violation of the Civil Rights Act of 1866, 42 U.S.C. \u00a7 1981. We reverse and remand for further consideration.</p>\n<p id=\"b565-30\">Claude Long, a black college graduate and former Department of Labor compliance officer, sought employment with Ford Motor Company, hoping to get into industrial management in the field of labor relations. On July 19, 1967, Long was hired as a production line foreman. <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"502\">*502</page-number>After nearly two years on this job, during which time he received three satisfactory and one unsatisfactory performance evaluations, Long filed a complaint with the Michigan Civil Rights Commission, alleging that his race was the cause of harassment, an unfair performance review, and the denial of a promotion. In May 1969, Long was transferred to the Industrial Relations Department of Ford\u2019s Frame Plant, and he withdrew his charge prior to investigation.</p>\n<p id=\"b566-4\">At the Frame Plant, Long was rotated among several positions. He began as a \u201cwage analyst\u201d on June 1, 1969. In January 1970 he was assigned to head the Suggestions Program, in which capacity he received an award. In April he was shifted to a position where he developed the Frame Plant\u2019s medical leave procedures. He was returned to the wage analyst position in June 1970. On these jobs, Long received a \u201csatisfactory plus\u201d performance evaluation on December 1, 1969, a letter of repimand on July 24, 1970 (prompted primarily by work left on his desk when he left for vacation on June 28), and an \u201cunsatisfactory\u201d rating on October 26, 1970. After this final evaluation, Long submitted a letter of rebuttal to the poor rating. Following a meeting with his immediate and plant supervisors, Long resigned on November 30, 1970, after being offered the choice of discharge or resignation. On November 17, 1971, Long filed a complaint in Federal District Court, alleging violations of Title VII of the 1964 Civil Rights Act, 42 U. S.C. \u00a7 2000e et seq., and of the Civil Rights Act of 1866, 42 U.S.C. \u00a7 1981. On May 1, 1972, the District Court dismissed his claim under Title VII for failure to comply with th'e requirement of a timely filing with the Federal Equal Employment Opportunity Commission. The District Court proceeded to a hearing on the merits of the \u00a7 1981 claim.</p>\n<p id=\"b566-11\">Testimony was taken from Long, his supervisors, and his fellow workers. Long\u2019s primary argument was that he had been treated in a dissimilar manner from other persons, that he had received outright antagonism from his plant supervisor, and that the actions which prevented him from rising to a position in labor relations were prompted by racial prejudice.</p>\n<p id=\"b566-12\">The District Court found for Long. While it made various findings and observations, the District Court\u2019s central holding was that Ford violated Section 1981 by failing to train Long adequately for his tasks.<footnotemark>1</footnotemark> The District Court characterized Long as a \u201ccapable man,\u201d who because he \u201cwas not adequately trained . . . could not perform adequately.\u201d <footnotemark>2</footnotemark> The Court concluded:</p>\n<blockquote id=\"b566-13\">\u201cIf [black] people are not given adequate job training and are, as a result, terminated, then unequal employment opportunity still results. This imbalance is a real factor in racial discrimination. Racial discrimination in employment will not end until such people are given thorough job training so that they can perform adequately. Inadequate job training in a situation such as this fosters racial discrimination. Thus, this court is convinced that race was a factor (possibly not the only factor) in the termination of Claude Long.\u201d <footnotemark>3</footnotemark></blockquote>\n<p id=\"b566-14\">Ford makes two basic arguments on appeal. First, it contends that Appellee\u2019s complaint should have been dismissed because he failed to pursue his remedies under Title VII of the 1964 Civil Rights Act. Second, Ford contends that reversal on the merits is necessary because the record and findings of the District Court do not sustain a judgment for Long under the principles <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"503\">*503</page-number>of McDonnell Douglas Corp. v. Green, 411 U.S. 792, 93 S.Ct. 1817, 36 L.Ed.2d 668 (1973).</p>\n<p id=\"b567-5\">Ford does not contend that Section 1981 does not apply to private employment contracts. It is settled that Section 1981 prohibits racial discrimination in private employment.<footnotemark>4</footnotemark></p>\n<p id=\"b567-6\">Ford argues, however, that Long\u2019s complaint should have been dismissed because he failed to file a charge with the Equal Employment Opportunity Commission within 210 days of his discharge. This was a jurisdictional prerequisite for bringing a Title VII suit under 42 U.S.C. \u00a7 2000e-5(d) (1970),<footnotemark>5</footnotemark> and, so it is argued, impliedly a jurisdictional prerequisite to a \u00a7 1981 action.</p>\n<p id=\"b567-7\">Ford\u2019s procedural objection is not without support in the case law. In Waters v. Wisconsin Steel Works of Int\u2019l Harvesters Co., 427 F.2d 476 (7th Cir.), cert. denied, 400 U.S. 911, 91 S.Ct. 137, 27 L.Ed.2d 151 (1970), the Seventh Circuit held that a plaintiff in a \u00a7 1981 action must show a reasonable excuse for having bypassed his Title VII remedies. <em>See also </em>Kinsey v. Legg, Mason &amp; Co., Inc., 60 F.R.D. 91 (D.D.C.1973).</p>\n<p id=\"b567-8\">This viewpoint is a minority position. The Third, Fifth, Eighth, and District of Columbia Circuits have concluded that Section 1981\u2019s availability is not limited to those plaintiffs who have pursued their Title VII remedies or have shown a reasonable excuse for not doing so. Young v. Int\u2019l Telephone &amp; Telegraph Co., 438 F.2d 757 (3d Cir. 1971); Caldwell v. National Brewing Co., 5 Cir., 443 F.2d 1044 (1971); Brady v. Bristol-Meyers Co., 459 F.2d 621 (8th Cir. 1972); Macklin v. Spector Freight Systems, Inc., 156 U.S.App.D.C. 69, 478 F.2d 979 (1973). Furthermore, this Court has held in another context that \u201c \u00a7 1981 [is] a separate and concurrent cause of action with Title VII.\u201d Head v. Timken Roller Bearing Co., 486 F.2d 870 (6th Cir. 1973). We adopt the prevailing view that a plaintiff need not pursue his Title VII remedies before instituting a cause of action under Section 1981.</p>\n<p id=\"b567-12\">We are impelled to this conclusion by rules of statutory construction. If Congress had expressly limited Section 1981\u2019s availability in the manner Ford urges upon us, we would, be bound by the partial repeal of the earlier statute. Here, however, the question is whether we may imply \u00e1 change in Section 1981 from the silent face of Title VII of the 1964 Civil Rights Act. This task is complicated by the fact that in 1964 Congress may not have recognized that Section 1981 was available to litigants <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"504\">*504</page-number>against racial discrimination in private employment.<footnotemark>6</footnotemark></p>\n<p id=\"b568-4\">In Posadas v. National City Bank, 296 U.S. 497, 503, 56 S.Ct. 349, 80 L.Ed. 351 (1936), the Supreme Court stated that a repeal of a statute by implication is not favored. There are two categories where repeal by implication is possible.</p>\n<blockquote id=\"b568-5\">(1) [W]here provisions in the two acts are in irreconcilable conflict, the later act to the extent of the conflict constitutes an implied repeal of the earlier one; and (2) if the later act covers the whole subject of the earlier one and is clearly intended as a substitute, it will operate similarly as a repeal of the earlier act. 296 U.S. at 503.</blockquote>\n<p id=\"b568-6\">Title VII is not \u201cin irreconcilable conflict\u201d with Section 1981, and it does not cover the field in which Section 1981 was sown.<footnotemark>7</footnotemark> <em>See </em>Sullivan v. Little Hunting Park, 396 U.S. 229, 237, 90 S.Ct. 400, 24 L.Ed.2d 386 (1969) (regarding the compatibility of \u00a7 1982 and the provisions of the Fair Housing Act of 1968). Thus, the availability of Section 1981 is not limited by the existence of remedies under Title VII. \u201c [Legislative enactments in [the area of racial discrimination in employment] have long evinced a general intent to accord parallel or overlapping remedies against discrimination.\u201d Alexander v. Gardner-Denver Co., 415 U.S. 36, 94 S.Ct. 1011, 39 L.Ed.2d 147 (1974) (citingto \u00a7 1981). Thus the District Court correctly proceeded to the merits of Appellee\u2019s claim.</p>\n<p id=\"b568-11\">We cannot affirm the District Court\u2019s decision on the merits, however, because it rests upon an erroneous view of Section 1981. That provision, first enacted as part of the Civil Rights Act of 1966,<footnotemark>8</footnotemark>states:</p>\n<blockquote id=\"b568-12\">All persons within the jurisdiction of the United States shall have the same right in every State and Territory to make and enforce contracts, to sue, be parties, give evidence, and to the full and equal benefit of all laws and proceedings for the security of persons and property as is enjoyed by white citizens, and shall be subject to like punishment, pains, penalties, taxes, licenses, and exactions of every kind, and to no other.</blockquote>\n<p id=\"b568-13\">When a person sues under this statute to enforce his right not to be discriminated against in private employment, he must show that he was unable to make or enforce a contract that white citizens were able to make or enforce. Applied to the facts of this case, Appellee Long must show that he was forced to resign because of dissimilar treatment caused in part by his race.</p>\n<p id=\"b568-14\">As originally designed in 1866, Section 1981 was intended to uproot the institution of slavery and to eradicate its badges and incidents. <em>See </em>Jones v. Alfred H. Mayer Co., 392 U.S. 409, 422-437, 88 S.Ct. 2186, 20 L.Ed.2d <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"505\">*505</page-number>1189, (1968) (analysis applied to \u00a7 1981 in Tillman v. Wheaton-Haven Recreation Assn., 410 U.S. 431, 439, 93 S.Ct. 1090, 35 L.Ed.2d 403 (1973).) When an employer, public or private, places more stringent requirements on employees because of their race, Section 1981 is violated. The purpose for which the Section was enacted \u2014 to afford equal opportunities to secure the benefits of American life regardless of race \u2014 requires1 that a court adopt a broad outlook in enforcing Section 1981. Schemes of discrimination, whether blatant or subtle, are forbidden. Newbern v. Lake Lorelei, Inc., 308 F.Supp. 407, 416 (S.D.Ohio 1968). <em>Cf. </em>Lane v. Wilson, 307 U.S. 268, 275, 59 S.Ct. 872, 83 L.Ed. 1281 (1939).</p>\n<p id=\"b569-5\">Section 1981 is by its very terms, however, not an affirmative action program. It is an equalizing provision, seeking to ensure that rights do not vary according to race. It does not require that persons be accorded preferential treatment because of their race.<footnotemark>9</footnotemark> On this point we view the Supreme Court\u2019s discussion of Title VII as applicable to Section 1981:<footnotemark>10</footnotemark></p>\n<blockquote id=\"b569-6\">\u201cCongress did not intend by Title VII, however, to guarantee a job to every person regardless of qualifications. In short, the Act does not command that any person be hired simply because he was formerly the subject of discrimination, or because he is a member of a minority group. Discriminatory preference for any group, minority or majority, is precisely and only what Congress has proscribed. What is required by Congress is the removal of artificial, arbitrary, and unnecessary barriers to employment when the barriers operate invidiously to discriminate on the basis of racial or other impermissible classification.\u201d Griggs v. Duke Power Co., 401 U.S. 424, 430-431, 91 S.Ct. 849, 853, 28 L.Ed.2d 158 (1971).</blockquote>\n<p id=\"b569-12\">Thus, it was error for the District Court to hold Appellant liable for a failure to train Appellee adequately, absent a showing that this failure constituted either dissimilar treatment from the training whites receive or treatment similar on its face but dissimilar in its effects upon racial minorities and unfounded on business necessity. <em>See </em>Griggs v. Duke Power Co., <em>supra; </em>McDonnell Douglas Corp. v. Green, 411 U. S. 792, 93 S.Ct. 1817, 36 L.Ed.2d 668 (1973); Robinson v. Lorillard, 444 F.2d 791 (4th Cir. 1971).</p>\n<p id=\"b569-13\">Although the District Court made various observations and findings of fact, we cannot perceive an alternative holding sufficient in detail under Rule 52(a), Fed.Rules Civ.Proc., to permit review. Rather than specify that Appellee had received dissimilar treatment, the District Court relied on a rationale of inadequate training <em>per se. </em>Thus, we must remand for further proceedings to determine whether Appellee should recover on a proper ground.</p>\n<p id=\"b569-14\">The parties and the District Court did not have the benefit of <em>McDonnell Douglas\u2019 </em>reasoning in the proceedings below. On remand, the District Court should apply <em>McDonnell Douglas\u2019 </em>principles on the order and allocation of proof.<footnotemark>11</footnotemark> A person alleging a \u00a7 1981 violation must first establish that his employment terms vary from those which his employer accords to similarly situated white workers. <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"506\">*506</page-number>This can be shown by proof either that intentional racial prejudice entered into his treatment or that a facially neutral practice (here Appellant\u2019s performance evaluation system) operates diseriminatorily against minority employees. In this case, Appellee may be able to establish that he was trained inadequately whereas white co-employees were trained adequately.<footnotemark>12</footnotemark> He may be able to establish that Ford\u2019s promotion system, which relies heavily upon the subjective evaluation of supervisors, has a discriminatory impact on minority employees, so that its use in discharging him was improper.<footnotemark>13</footnotemark> Appellee may be able to establish that similarly situated white employees with comparable records would have been offered different positions within Ford rather than discharged, whereas he was forced to leave Ford altogether. We express no opinion as to whether the record below would support any of these possible holdings.</p>\n<p id=\"b570-4\">If Appellee establishes a prima facie case of dissimilar treatment due in part to racial discrimination, Appellant must then establish \u201csome legitimate, nondiscriminatory reason for the employee\u2019s rejection.\u201d McDonnell Douglas Corp. v. Green, 411 U.S. at 802. In this case Appellant would argue that Appellee\u2019s unsatisfactory performance review justified his termination and that its system of evaluation is grounded on business necessity.<footnotemark>14</footnotemark></p>\n<p id=\"b570-9\">If Appellee has established a prima facie case but Appellant\u2019s rebuttal is sufficient to overcome Appellee\u2019s initial showing, Appellee must then prove that his discharge was nonetheless a violation of Section 1981 because Appellant\u2019s stated reason for the discharge was merely a pretext for a termination actually based on racial prejudice. 411 U.S. at 804. If the proofs reach this point, the District Court will have the task of evaluating the objectivity, sincerity, and honesty of the witnesses to arrive at a necessarily subjective conclusion.</p>\n<p id=\"b570-10\">Because of the new light shed on employment discrimination cases by <em>McDonnell Douglas, </em>we remand this case for such further proceedings as the District Court deems necessary to arrive at a just and proper conclusion. Affirmed in part and reversed in part for further proceedings in conformance with the principles enunciated herein.</p>\n<footnote label=\"1\">\n<p id=\"b566-5\">. The District Court\u2019s opinion is reported at 352 F.Supp. 135 (E.D.Mich.1972). Long\u2019s lack of training was cited as the \u201cfact that is controlling in this situation.\u201d 352 F.Supp. at 139.</p>\n</footnote>\n<footnote label=\"2\">\n<p id=\"b566-15\">. <em>Id.</em></p>\n</footnote>\n<footnote label=\"3\">\n<p id=\"b566-16\">. <em>Id. </em>at 140.</p>\n</footnote>\n<footnote label=\"4\">\n<p id=\"b567-9\">. Although the Supreme Court has not yet squarely held that this is the case, in Tillman v. Wheaton-Haven Recreation Assn., Inc., 410 U.S. 431, 439-440, 93 S.Ct. 1090, 35 L.Ed.2d 403 (1973), the Supreme Court held that \u00a7 1981 is applicable to private discriminatory acts. An employment contract is covered by \u00a7 1981, and Title YII of the 1964 Civil Rights Act has not preempted the field of employment discrimination. Johnson v. City of Cincinnati, 450 F.2d 796 (6th Cir. 1971).</p>\n<p id=\"b567-10\">Furthermore, although this Circuit has not explicitly held that \u00a7 1981 prohibits racial discrimination in private employment, this conclusion is implicit in at least two holdings. Head v. Timken Roller Bearing Co., 486 F.2d 870 (6th Cir. 1973); Marlowe v. Fisher Body, 489 F.2d 1057 (6th Cir. 1973). This conclusion is unanimous among the circuits that have decided the question.
