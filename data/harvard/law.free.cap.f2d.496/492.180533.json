WRIGHT, Circuit Judge:</author>\n<p id=\"b556-20\">Paul Oscar appeals from a conviction for aiding, abetting, and assisting two aliens \u201cattempting to enter the United States by eluding inspection by making a false verbal claim of United States citizenship\u201d in violation of 8 U.S.C. \u00a7 1325 and 18 U.S.C. \u00a7 2. Appellant was convicted after trial to a United States Magistrate, and the conviction was affirmed in district court. We reverse.</p>\n<p id=\"b556-21\">The facts are not in dispute. Appellant and a co-defendant, Earnest Holmes, contrived a scheme to smuggle Philip Cain and Manuel Tejeda, both British Hondurans, into the United States. Appellant and Holmes told Cain and Tejeda to hide their passports and claim to have been born in New Orleans <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"493\">*493</page-number>when questioned by' customs officials. Holmes then drove the two aliens from a point in Mexico to the United States Port of Entry at San Ysidro, California. In response to questioning by the Customs Inspector, Holmes replied that he, Cain, and Tejeda were United States citizens. Due to Holmes\u2019 apparent nervousness, he was directed to drive to a secondary inspection area where further investigation revealed that Cain and Tejeda were aliens. Holmes, Cain and Tejeda were arrested immediately, and appellant was arrested later that day.</p>\n<p id=\"b557-5\">Appellant\u2019s sole contention on appeal is that this conduct does not constitute a violation of 8 U.S.C. \u00a7 1325 and 18 U.S. C. \u00a7 2. Section 2 provides that a person who aids and abets another to commit a crime against the United States is punishable as a principal. To prove guilt under this statute, the government must prove that the person aided and abetted actually committed the underlying offense. Shuttlesworth v. City of Birmingham, 373 U.S. 262, 83 S.Ct. 1130, 10 L.Ed.2d 335 (1963); United States v. Jones, 425 F.2d 1048 (9th Cir. 1970). Therefore, Cain and Tejeda must have violated Section 1325 if appellant\u2019s conviction is to be affirmed.</p>\n<p id=\"b557-6\">Section 1325 provides:</p>\n<blockquote id=\"b557-7\">Any alien who (1) enters the United States at any time or place other than as designated by immigration officers, or (2) eludes examination or inspection by immigration officers, or (3) obtains entry to the United States by a willfully false or misleading representation or the willful concealment of a material fact, shall ... be guilty of a misdemeanor .</blockquote>\n<p id=\"b557-8\">By its terms, Section 1325 is violated only if the alien \u201centers\u201d or \u201cobtains entry to\u201d the United States [(1), (3)] or if the alien \u201celudes examination or inspection by immigration officers\u201d [(2)].</p>\n<p id=\"b557-9\">I. WAS THERE AN \u201cENTRY\u201d?</p>\n<p id=\"b557-10\">First, we consider whether Cain and Tejeda \u201centered\u201d the United States. Section 1325 falls within Chapter 12 of Title 8. The term \u201centry\u201d is defined in 8 U.S.C. \u00a7 1101(a) (13) for use in Chapter 12 as \u201cany coming of an alien into the United States . . . \u201d This definition does not clarify the issue. Nor is the legislative history helpful. The only consideration given to the meaning of \u201centry\u201d as defined in \u00a7 1101(a) (13) concerned the distinction between original entries and reentries into the country. See 2 U.S.Code Cong. &amp; Admin. News, 82nd Cong., 2nd Sess. p. 1683 (1952).</p>\n<p id=\"b557-12\">In a physical sense, Cain and Tejeda entered the United States when they physically crossed the international border upon arrival at the Port of Entry. But some courts have held that an \u201centry,\u201d as defined by \u00a7 1101(a)(13), has not been accomplished until physical presence is accompanied by freedom from official restraint. United States v. Vasilatos, 209 F.2d 195 (3d Cir. 1954); In re Dubbiosi, 191 F.Supp. 65 (E.D. Va.1961). Under this standard the aliens had not \u201centered\u201d the United States because they were never free from the official restraint of the customs officials at the San Ysidro Port of Entry. Naturally, appellant urges us to accept this construction.</p>\n<p id=\"b557-13\">The government argues that <em>Vasilatos </em>and <em>Dubbiosi </em>are distinguishable since they dealt with the question whether certain aliens had \u201centered\u201d the country and were therefore entitled to deportation hearings prior to expulsion from the country.<footnotemark>1</footnotemark> The courts held that although the aliens were physically present, they had not \u201centered\u201d the United States, and thus were not entitled to hearings, because they were never free from official restraint. To be sure, this is a different context than the one which faces this court. But like this court, the <em>Vasilatos </em>and <em>Dubbiosi </em>courts were required to interpret \u201centry\u201d <em>as </em><page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"494\">*494</page-number><em>defined in </em>\u00a7 <em>1101(a) </em>(IS). It is unlikely that Congress would define a term in \u00a7 1101 for use throughout Chapter 12 if it intended the term to have different meanings in different sections of the chapter. More importantly, <em>Vasilatos </em>and <em>Dubbiosi </em>at the very least show that appellant\u2019s proposed construction is <em>reasonable </em>within the context of \u00a7 1101(a) (13) and Chapter 12. This, coupled with our duty to construe criminal statutes strictly, requires us to adopt appellant\u2019s proposed construction within the context of this case. See United States v. Bass, 404 U.S. 336, 92 S.Ct. 515, 30 L.Ed.2d 488 (1971). We conclude that Cain and Tejeda did not \u201center\u201d the United States as that term is used in \u00a7 1325(1), (3).</p>\n<p id=\"b558-4\">II. WAS THERE AN \u201cELUDING\u201d?</p>\n<p id=\"b558-5\">Second, we consider whether Cain and Tejeda \u201celude[d] examination or inspection by immigration officers.\u201d We have found no legislative history or judicial construction to aid us in discerning the meaning of this phrase. Nevertheless, it seems clear that Cain and Tejeda did not violate it. Webster\u2019s New World Dictionary (College Edition) defines \u201celude\u201d:</p>\n<blockquote id=\"b558-6\">1. to avoid or escape from by quickness, cunning, etc. 2. to escape detection by; evade; baffle . . . .</blockquote>\n<p id=\"b558-7\">Cain and Tejeda did not avoid, escape detection by, or evade examination or inspection. Indeed, they were examined and inspected thoroughly enough to reveal that they were aliens. Thus, while Cain and Tejeda were deceitful, they did not \u201cexclude examination.\u201d</p>\n<p id=\"b558-8\">Since Cain and Tejeda neither \u201centered\u201d the United States nor \u201celuded examination,\u201d they did not violate \u00a7 1325. Consequently, appellant did not aid and abet them to violate \u00a7 1325, and his conviction must be reversed. It is clear that Cain and Tejeda attempted to violate \u00a7 1325, but \u00a7 1325 does not include attempts within its purview. Nor was this apparently a congressional oversight, for at least concerning appellant\u2019s conduct, \u00a7 1324 regulates attempts.</p>\n<p id=\"b558-10\">Reversed.</p>\n<footnote label=\"1\">\n<p id=\"b557-14\">. <em>See </em>8 U.S.C. \u00a7 1251 et seq.</p>\n</footnote>\n</opinion>\n<opinion data-order=\"9\" data-type=\"opinion\" id=\"x999-3\" type=\"concurrence\">\n<author id=\"b558-11\">KOELSCH, Circuit Judge</author>\n<p id=\"AU7\">(concurring specially):</p>\n<p id=\"b558-12\">I reach the same result as my brothers, but by a shorter route. Had the charge been conspiracy (18 U.S.C. \u00a7 371) to violate 8 U.S.C. \u00a7 1325, this conviction would have been invulnerable. But Congress has not made penal the acts which Oscar aided and abetted. 8 U.S.C. \u00a7 1325 does not in terms include attempts to enter, nor is there a general federal statute which fills this gap. (See, for example, Cal.Penal Code \u00a7 663; Oregon Rev.St. \u00a7 161.405(1); Rev.Code Wash.Anno. \u00a7 9.01.070; Idaho Code Anno. \u00a7 18-306.) Thus here there was no \u201cunderlying offense.\u201d</p>\n<p id=\"b558-13\">Accordingly, I perceive no need to pass upon the meaning of \u201centry\u201d and \u201celuding\u201d.</p>\n</opinion>\n</casebody>\n",
