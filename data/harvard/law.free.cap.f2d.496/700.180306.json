She charges that the hearing did not conform to the requirements of due process and that her dismissal was arbitrary and unreasonable. She seeks injunctive and declaratory relief and damages for violation of her rights secured by 42 U. S.C.A. \u00a7 1983. The district court dismissed the action finding that Toups \u201cwas not dismissed because of her race, color or sex; rather, substantive deficiencies in her teaching ability and attitude during her employ was the cause of her dismissal.\u201d We affirm.</p>\n<p id=\"b764-23\">It is undisputed that Toups was furnished a copy of the charges well in advance of the public hearing granted by the school board, at which she appeared represented by counsel. Subsequently she was officially notified of her dismissal by the Board. The court below carefully considered the record of the hearing before the Board, as we have. We agree that there was substantial evidence to support the school board\u2019s action ; that it acted impartially and fairly. That ends the matter. \u201cThe findings and decision of academic bodies are to be upheld by the courts when reached by correct procedures and supported by substantial evidence.\u201d Thompson v. <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"701\">*701</page-number>Madison County Board of Education, 5 Cir. 1973, 476 F.2d 676; Green v.
