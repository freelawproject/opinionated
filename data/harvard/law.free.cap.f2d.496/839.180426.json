S.C. \u00a7 6861, levied a $4,200,000 jeopardy assessment against appellee WestgateCalifornia Corporation (Westgate), covering Westgate\u2019s alleged liability for federal income taxes for the tax periods 1963-67, 1969 and 1970. On October 23, 1973, the IRS filed notices of federal tax liens in several California and Oregon counties where Westgate\u2019s properties and assets are located.</p>\n<p id=\"b904-20\">After unsuccessful negotiations between the parties, Westgate filed this action on November 15, 1973, seeking to enjoin the IRS from continuing to enforce the liens. Westgate alleged that the Commissioner of Internal Revenue had abused his discretion under 26 U.S. C. \u00a7 6325 by refusing to issue a certificate of release or subordination of the liens or a certificate of discharge of any property subject to the liens. On that day, the district court issued an Order to Show Cause why the relief requested by Westgate should not be granted, and set a hearing for November 19. The government responded by filing a motion to dismiss, arguing lack of jurisdiction and failure to state a claim upon which relief could be granted.</p>\n<p id=\"b904-21\">Following a two-day hearing, the district court entered an order on November 20 directing the Commissioner immediately to release and discharge all liens which had been imposed upon the <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"841\">*841</page-number>property of Westgate and its subsidiaries. The order also prohibited the IRS from imposing any further liens upon the property of Westgate or its subsidiaries without prior approval of the court. Stay of this order pending an appeal was denied. The government appealed and applied to Circuit Judge Wallace for a stay of the order pending appeal. Judge Wallace directed that the order be stayed until November 26, 1973, pending a determination of the merits of the government\u2019s motion by a panel of this court.</p>\n<p id=\"b905-4\">Following oral arguments on November 26, we granted the government\u2019s motion to stay the district court\u2019s order until further notice. At the same time, we directed Westgate to show cause in writing why the district court\u2019s order should not be vacated and the action dismissed for want of jurisdiction. We conclude that the November 20 order of the district court must be vacated and the action must be dismissed.</p>\n<p id=\"b905-5\">The jurisdictional question is whether a district court has jurisdiction to enjoin the IRS from imposing a jeopardy assessment. Three provisions of the Internal Revenue Code are involved. 26 U.S.C. \u00a7 7421(a) provides that \u201c[ejxeept as provided in section . 6123(a), ... no suit for the purpose of restraining the assessment or collection of any tax shall be maintained in any court by any person. . \u201d This \u201cpay and sue\u201d rule, which originated in 1867,<footnotemark>1</footnotemark> requires that a taxpayer must first pay an assessment before he seeks judicial review of that assessment.</p>\n<p id=\"b905-13\">26 U.S.C. \u00a7 6213(a) contains a broad exception to \u00a7 7421(a). It provides, in pertinent part:</p>\n<blockquote id=\"b905-15\">Within 90 days . . . after the notice of deficiency authorized in section 6212 is mailed . . . , the taxpayer may file a petition with the Tax Court for a redetermination of the deficiency. <em>Except as otherwise provided in section 6861 </em>no assessment of a deficiency in respect of any tax imposed by subtitle A or B or chapter 42 and no levy or proceeding in court for its collection shall be made, begun, or prosecuted until such notice has been mailed to the taxpayer, nor until the expiration of such 90-day . . . period, nor, . . . until the decision of the Tax Court has become final. Notwithstanding the provisions of section 7421(a), the making of such assessment or the beginning of such proceeding or levy during the time such prohibition is in force may be enjoined by a proceeding in the proper court.<footnotemark>2</footnotemark> (Emphasis added)</blockquote>\n<p id=\"b905-20\">26 U.S.C. \u00a7 6861(a) provides:</p>\n<blockquote id=\"b905-21\">If the Secretary or his delegate believes that the assessment or collection of a deficiency, as defined in section 6211, will be jeopardized by delay, he shall, <em>notwithstanding the provisions of section 6218(a), </em>immediately assess such deficiency (together with all interest, additional amounts, and additions to the tax provided for by law), and notice and demand shall be made by the Secretary or his delegate for the payment thereof.<footnotemark>3</footnotemark> (Emphasis added)</blockquote>\n<p id=\"b906-3\"><page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"842\">*842</page-number>Westgate argues that these three statutes create the following procedural scheme: Section 6861(a) operates within the procedure of \u00a7 6213(a). At most, \u00a7 6861(a) authorizes a deviation in the collection process; otherwise, it deals with the identical subject matter of \u00a7 6213(a) and is intended to achieve substantially the same result. Moreover, \u00a7 6861(a) does not preclude a taxpayer from seeking injunctive relief in the district court pursuant to \u00a7 6213(a). It is therefore erroneous to interpret \u00a7 6861(a) as preventing the remedy provided in \u00a7 6213(a) and reinstating \u00a7 7421(a).</p>\n<p id=\"b906-4\">This argument is without merit. First, \u00a7 6861(a) does not authorize a deviation from \u00a7 6213(a) solely in respect to the collection process; it concerns the \u201cassessment <em>or </em>collection of a deficiency\u201d (emphasis ours) and authorizes the IRS immediately to \u201cassess such deficiency. . . .\u201d Second, \u00a7 6861 (a) does preclude the taxpayer from seeking injunctive relief under \u00a7 6213 (a). Section 6861(a) authorizes the IRS to make a jeopardy assessment \u201cnotwithstanding the provisions of section 6213(a). . . .\u201d Moreover, \u00a7 6213 (a) grants the district court jurisdiction to enjoin the \u201cma[ki ng], beg [inning], or prosecut[ion]\u201d of a deficiency assessment with respect to a tax imposed under subtitle A, levy or court proceeding for collection, in three specific circumstances, \u201c[e]xcept as otherwise provided in section 6861. . . .\u201d The jeopardy assessment in the present case was made on October 19, 1973, before Westgate had received a deficiency notice. This falls within the express exception in \u00a7 6213(a) to its requirement that no assessment may be made \u201cuntil such notice [of deficiency authorized in section 6212] has been mailed to the taxpayer. . . . \u201d Section 6861(b) authorizes the IRS to withhold mailing a deficiency notice for 60 days after the making of the jeopardy assessment.<footnotemark>4</footnotemark> Because \u00a7 6861(b) authorizes a procedure different from that authorized in the second sentence of \u00a7 6213(a), and because the second sentence of \u00a7 6213(a) exempts from its coverage those provisions of \u00a7 6861 which are in conflict with it, \u00a7 6861 does displace the remedial provisions of \u00a7 6213(a) on these facts.<footnotemark>5</footnotemark> Thus \u00a7 7421(a) does apply here.</p>\n<p id=\"b906-12\">Westgate also makes a statutory construction argument based upon the third sentence of \u00a7 6213(a). It is true that this sentence, standing alone, would give the district court jurisdiction to enjoin an assessment, but this sentence does not stand alone. It authorizes an injunction against an assessment only \u201cduring the time period such prohibition is in force. . . . \u201d The second sentence of \u00a7 6213 dictates that the prohibition was not in force, because \u00a7 6861 provides otherwise, and thus the third sentence of \u00a7 6213(a) does not create jurisdiction in the district court.</p>\n<p id=\"b906-14\">Westgate also argues that it falls within the narrow exception to the \u201cpay and sue\u201d rule of \u00a7 7421(a) recognized in Miller v. Standard Nut Margarine Co. of Florida, 1932, 284 U.S. 498, 52 S.Ct. 260, 76 L.Ed. 422, and Enochs v. Williams Packing and Navigation Co., Inc., 1962, 370 U.S. 1, 82 S.Ct. 1125, 8 L.Ed.2d 292. These cases establish a two-part test which the taxpayer must meet before he may seek an injunction in district court. First, he must show that \u201cit is clear that under no circumstances could the Government ultimately <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"843\">*843</page-number>prevail.\u201d <em>Enochs, supra, </em>370 U.S. at 7, 82 S.Ct. at 1129. Whether the government has a chance of ultimately prevailing</p>\n<blockquote id=\"b907-4\">is to be determined on the basis of the information available to [the government] at the time of suit. Only if it is then apparent that, under the most liberal view of the law and the facts, the United States cannot establish its claim, may the suit for an injunction be maintained. Otherwise, the District Court is without jurisdiction, and the complaint must be dismissed. To require more than good faith on the part of the Government would unduly interfere with a collateral objective of the Act \u2014 protection of the collector from litigation pending a suit for refund. <em>Id. </em>at 7-8, 82 S.Ct. at 1129.</blockquote>\n<p id=\"b907-5\">Second, the taxpayer must show that \u201cthere exists special and extraordinary circumstances sufficient to bring the case within some acknowledged head of equity jurisprudence. . . . \u201d <em>Miller, supra, </em>284 U.S. at 509, 52 S.Ct. at 263, e. g., that he \u201cwould suffer irreparable injury if collection were effected.\u201d <em>Enochs, supra, </em>370 U.S. at 7, 82 S.Ct. at 1129.</p>\n<p id=\"b907-7\">The only documents in the record before us are Westgate\u2019s complaint and several affidavits. These documents allege that as a result of the liens imposed by the IRS under the jeopardy assessment, Westgate \u201chas been unable to obtain badly needed financing and lines of credit from various financial and commercial banking institutions\u201d and \u201cwill be rendered insolvent and forced to file a petition in bankruptcy.\u201d We assume that this meets the second requirement of the <em>Miller-Enochs </em>test, but need not, and do not, decide that it does.</p>\n<p id=\"b907-12\"> It is settled that a suit to enjoin the assessment or collection of taxes, in spite of \u00a7 7421(a), \u201cmay not be entertained <em>merely </em>because collection would cause an irreparable injury, such as the ruination of the taxpayer\u2019s enterprise.\u201d <em>Enochs, supra, </em>370 U.S. at 6, 82 S.Ct. at 1129 (emphasis supplied).<footnotemark>6</footnotemark> Westgate must also establish the inability of the Government to prevail on any valid theory of tax collection.<footnotemark>7</footnotemark> The burden of proof is on the taxpayer. Vuin v. Burton, 6 Cir., 1964, 327 F.2d 967. The complaint, construed in a manner most favorable to Westgate, fails to show that the government cannot establish its claim. Westgate does not even allege that the taxes are not due, nor that the government has acted in bad faith. We cannot infer nonliability of Westgate from the record before us.</p>\n<p id=\"b907-13\">Westgate also alleged that the District Director of Internal Revenue arbitrarily, capriciously and unreasonably refused to issue any certificates of release, discharge or subordination of the liens, as he is empowered to do under \u00a7 6325. We need not decide whether this allegation would permit the court to issue the injunction that it issued, or whether it would support an action to review the District Director\u2019s alleged failure to act. This question is moot. Since we heard oral argument, the parties have entered into an \u201cAgreement as to Subordination of Federal Tax Liens.\u201d The District Director has acted.</p>\n<p id=\"b907-14\">The order appealed from is reversed, and the case is remanded with directions to enter a judgment dismissing the action.</p>\n<footnote label=\"1\">\n<p id=\"b905-8\">. <em>See </em>Act of March 2, 1867, ch. 169, \u00a7 10, 14 Stat. 475.</p>\n</footnote>\n<footnote label=\"2\">\n<p id=\"b905-9\">. In the present case, the taxes allegedly owed by Westgate were imposed under subtitle A (income taxes). When the action was filed, the time within which the Commissioner was required to give notice of deficiency had not expired and no notice had been given. Thus no petition could be, or had been, filed with the Tax Court.</p>\n</footnote>\n<footnote label=\"3\">\n<p id=\"b905-10\">. The decision of the District Director to make a \u00a7 6861 jeopardy assessment is subject to very narrow review. Transport Manufacturing and Equipment Co. of Delaware v. Trainor, 8 Cir., 1967, 382 F.2d 793; Ginsburg v. United States, 1 Cir., 1960, 278 F.2d 470; Lloyd v. Patterson, 5 Cir., 1957, 242 F.2d 742. <em>See also </em>9 Mertens, Law of Federal Taxation, \u00a7 49.145: \u201cIt is necessary only that the District Director <em>believe </em>that collection of the tax will be jeopardized by delay. The Code grants him a broad discretionary power, the exercise of which is a matter left to his personal judgment and opinion. For this reason the Tax Court and <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"842\">*842</page-number>other courts have declined to inquire into the District Director\u2019s belief or in any way <em>to </em>substitute their judgment for the judgment of the District Director.\u201d (Emphasis in original) <em>But see </em>Sherman v. Nash, 3 Cir., 1973, 488 F.2d 1081; Iannelli v. Long, 3 Cir., 1973, 487 F.2d 317; United States v.
