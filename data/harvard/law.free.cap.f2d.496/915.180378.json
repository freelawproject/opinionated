He argues that the failure to report the source of income as heroin sales is an essential element for which he was charged and \u201cthat the imposition of such a \u2018harsh disclosure' requirement is the wrong thing to do.\u201d He further asserts that he cannot be compelled to state the source of his income because it would tend to incriminate him. We affirm.</p>\n<p id=\"b980-24\">It is clear that Mirelez was not charged with falsely stating the source of his income but rather was charged with the willful failure to report certain gross income under 26 U.S. C.A. 7206(1), a perjury statute.<footnotemark>1</footnotemark> The gist of the offense is a willfully false <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"917\">*917</page-number>statement with respect to material fact or facts susceptible of proof. Kolaski v. United States, 5 Cir. 1966, 362 F.2d 847, 848. <em>Accord, </em>United States v. Lewis, 5 Cir. 1972, 475 F.2d 571, 573-574. Thus the violations to which Mirelez entered his pleas of guilty were complete with the omission of gross income, regardless of its source. United States v. Garcilaso de la Vega, 2 Cir. 1974, 489 F.2d 761, 765.</p>\n<p id=\"b981-4\">We are equally unimpressed with Mirelez\u2019 argument that he cannot be forced to incriminate himself by stating in his tax return that the source of income was the illegal sale of heroin. \u201cIt would be an extreme if not an extravagant application of the Fifth Amendment to say that it authorized a man to refuse to state the amount of his income because it had been made in crime. But if the defendant desired to test that or any other point he should have tested it in the return so that it could be passed upon. He could not draw a conjurer\u2019s circle around the whole matter by his own declaration that to write any word upon the government blank would bring him into danger of the law.\u201d United States v. Sullivan, 1927, 274 U.S. 259, 263-264, 47 S.Ct. 607, 608, 71 L.Ed. 1037.</p>\n<p id=\"b981-5\">Finally, relying on United States v. Sepe, 5 Cir. 1973, 486 F.2d 1044 (en banc), Mirelez now asserts that since we have disapproved any agreement between the prosecutor and defendant whereby a guilty plea is entered with a reservation of the right to appeal non-jurisdictional defects, he is entitled to have the adjudication of guilt based upon his plea reversed and have the case remanded so that he may plead anew. We disagree. The issues raised on this appeal go to the jurisdiction of the district court, <em>i. e. </em>an attack upon the indictment for failure to state an offense, and an assertion that the statute forming the basis of the charges in the two counts to which pleas were entered is an unconstitutional infringement of Mirelez\u2019 Fifth Amendment privilege. These issues were expressly excepted in <em>Sepe </em>and could be raised on appeal without specifically reserving the right to do so. <em>Sepe </em>simply disapproved the reservation of a right to appeal non-jurisdictional defects after a guilty plea.</p>\n<p id=\"b981-9\">We have considered and find without merit the other issues raised on appeal.</p>\n<p id=\"A_p\">Affirmed.</p>\n<footnote label=\"1\">\n<p id=\"b980-15\">.
