It is conceded that the postal inspectors who interrogated appellant read him his full <em>Miranda </em>rights and there is nothing to contradict the District Judge\u2019s ruling that his subsequent identification of himself and his subsequent answers to questions were voluntarily given.</p>\n<p id=\"b686-22\">The Fifth Circuit has held: \u201c[Wjhen all the circumstances indicate that the defendant knew of his right to remain silent and intelligently waived that right, the refusal to sign a written waiver does not render a confession inadmissible.\u201d United States v. Johnson, 455 F.2d 311, 314 (5th Cir. 1972). This language was recently quoted in support of this court\u2019s refusal \u201cto adopt . . . a narrow construction of Miranda\u201d in a fact situation somewhat parallel to our instant case. Hill v. Whealon, 490 F.2d 629 (6th Cir. 1974). We now express agreement with the Fifth Circuit\u2019s view that the refusal to sign a written waiver, standing alone, does not render inadmissible statements or evidence voluntarily given after full warnings.</p>\n<p id=\"b686-25\">As we read this record, there was ample evidence from which the jury could have concluded (beyond reasonable doubt) that appellant knowingly sought to cash a stolen welfare check made out to another party, and was caught red-handed in the act.</p>\n<p id=\"b686-26\">No other appellate issues of substance are presented and the judgment of conviction is affirmed.</p>\n</opinion>\n</casebody>\n",
