We employed such language in King-Kup Candies, Inc. v. King Candy Co., 48 CCPA 948, 288 F.2d 944, 129 USPQ 272 (1961) when we described KING\u2019S as being \u201calmost as weak a mark as can be found.\u201d Such expressions, however, should not obfuscate the basic issue. Confusion is confusion. The likelihood thereof is to be avoided, as much between \u201cweak\u201d marks as between \u201cstrong\u201d marks, or as between a \u201cweak\u201d and a \u201cstrong\u201d mark. Similarly, the statute, by providing remedies to trademark owners, enables those <em>owners to </em>protect their marks. It is through such owner-action that the public is protected from confusion. As we said in In re E. I. duPont deNemours &amp; Co., 476 F.2d 1357, 177 USPQ 563 (1973), neither the grant of registration nor its refusal automatically protects against confusion.</p>\n<p id=\"b1465-16\">The expressions \u201cweak\u201d and \u201centitled to limited protection\u201d are but other ways of saying, as the board went on to recognize in its opinion herein, that confusion is unlikely because the marks are of such non-arbitrary nature or so widely used that the public easily distinguishes slight differences in the marks under consideration as well as differences in the goods to which they are applied, even though the goods of the parties may be considered \u201crelated.\u201d That is the present case.</p>\n<p id=\"b1465-17\">The twenty-three registrations made of record by appellee do not, as appellee argues, establish widespread use of KING or KING\u2019S. They do, however, indicate a widespread adoption and registration thereof.</p>\n<p id=\"b1465-18\">We are convinced that the public would readily distinguish the differences between KING\u2019S and MISS KING\u2019S and between candy and cakes. Hence confusion is not likely when said marks are applied, respectively, to said goods.</p>\n<p id=\"b1465-19\">Appellant argues that the goods are sold in the same channels of trade, but submitted no evidence in support of that contention. Appellant also charges the board with error for having considered the absence of actual confusion over a period of 20 years. As set forth <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"1402\">*1402</page-number>in In re E. I. duPont deNemours &amp; Co., supra, such lack of confusion is an evidentiary element to be considered. In the absence of evidence to the contrary, such lack of actual confusion over so many years must be considered in this case as supportive of a finding that confusion is not likely in the future.</p>\n<p id=\"b1466-4\">Both parties have requested that we ignore the board's refusal to consider appellant\u2019s registration of KATHRYN KING\u2019S and that we rule on the issue of whether confusion is likely when that mark and MISS KING\u2019S are used on their respective goods. Both parties have briefed the issue here. The board\u2019s holdings, respecting the nature of opposer\u2019s mark, the differences in the marks and the goods, and the lack of actual confusion over many years, indicate that no useful purpose would be served by subjecting the parties to further proceedings below in this case. We think considerations similar to those listed above are equally applicable to this issue and that potential purchasers would readily distinguish KATHRYN KING\u2019S candy from MISS KING\u2019S cakes.</p>\n<p id=\"b1466-5\">Because we find no likelihood of confusion between appellee\u2019s mark and either of appellant\u2019s registered marks, the refusal of the board to consider appellant\u2019s KATHRYN KING\u2019S registration is moot. That refusal was error, as is evident from our opinions in Contour Chair-Lounge Co., Inc., v. The Englander Co., Inc., 51 CCPA 833, 324 F.2d 186, 139 USPQ 285 (1963); David Crystal, Inc. v. Shelburne Shirt Co., Inc., 59 CCPA 1248, 465 F.2d 926, 175 USPQ 112 (1972); and Anderson, Clayton and Co. v. Krier, 478 F.2d 1246, 178 USPQ 46 (CCPA, 1973).</p>\n<p id=\"b1466-6\">By fortuitous circumstance, a well-reasoned article concerning the point of law on which the board finds itself in disagreement with this court was published at about the time this case was heard.<footnotemark>4</footnotemark> The author concludes that reason supports the view long held by this court, rather than that expressed by the board in the opinion below and in its opinion on remand<footnotemark>5</footnotemark> in <em>Anderson, Clayton, </em>supra.</p>\n<p id=\"b1466-11\">We believe it appropriate to add merely a short list of the fundamental reasons supporting our statement of the law. In an opposition, the board must consider existing registrations of subsequent-user opposers, because (1) the statute, 15 U.S.C. \u00a7\u00a7 1051-1127, requires such consideration; (2) the basic question in an opposition is applicant\u2019s right to register (not merely, as the board says, whether the opposer \u201cwill be damaged\u201d) ; (3) in determining applicant\u2019s right to register, the entire statute, including Section 2(d), must be considered; (4) Section 2(d) says an applicant can register, <em>unless </em>his mark is likely to cause confusion with a mark <em>\u201cregistered </em>in the Patent Office <em>or </em>* * * previously used * * * \u201d (emphasis added); (5) the board\u2019s requirement that the registrant-opposer also be a prior user impermissively negates the statutory distinction (\u201cor\u201d) in Section 2(d) between a registered mark and a previously-used-but-unregistered mark, would permit simultaneous registration of the same mark for the same goods to different parties, and disregards \u2014 in effect conflicts with \u2014 Patent Office Rule 2.106(b), which forbids any attack (other than a request for cancellation) on the validity of a registration in an opposition; (6) the board\u2019s position is unsupported by either statutory or definitive decisional authority; <footnotemark>6</footnotemark> and (7) an opposer who, in the language of Section 13, \u201cbelieves he would be damaged,\u201d may in fact suffer damage to his <em>registration, </em>(Sec. 7(b)), if the applicant\u2019s mark is registered.</p>\n<p id=\"b1467-4\"><page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"1403\">*1403</page-number>As the board emphasized, registration is not compulsory. We recognize that an applicant-prior user may by delay lose the opportunity to effect cancellation. The answer to that concern resides in the statute. The effect of the entire statute in such instances is to upgrade the register and, so far as <em>registration </em>is concerned, to balance the equities, favoring the long-standing, non-fraudulent registration against the prior user who delays too long in electing to seek registration. The right to exclusive use, in such cases, may be determined in an appropriate action in a district court. We do not regard that result as undesirable. If it were, its correction would be grist for the Congressional mill, not for ours or the board\u2019s.</p>\n<p id=\"b1467-5\">Affirmed.</p>\n<footnote label=\"1\">\n<p id=\"b1464-28\">.
