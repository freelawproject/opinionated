The Court denied Sterzing\u2019s request for reinstatement as a teacher with the Fort Bend Independent School District on the grounds that his reinstatement would only revive antagonisms and that the award of monetary damages compensated Sterzing for his expectancy of reemployment. Sterzing brought this appeal solely to challenge the Court\u2019s denial of his request for reinstatement. The school district defendants filed notice of cross-appeal but subsequently abandoned their appeal. Since we find that the District Judge based his denial of reinstatement on an incorrect legal standard we vacate the judgment and remand for reconsideration of the issue of remedy.</p>\n<p id=\"b157-7\">The District Judge based his holding that Sterzing\u2019s First Amendment rights were violated on the ground that the school board improperly restricted Sterzing\u2019s right to speak and express his opinion in the classroom. In declining to grant reinstatement on the basis that it would be too antagonistic, the Court used an impermissible ground. On the hypothesis of a violation of his First and Fourteenth Amendment rights \u2014an hypothesis which is unchallenged in view of the dismissal of the cross-appeal <footnotemark>3</footnotemark> \u2014 the Court could not deny relief on such basis. Enforcement of constitutional rights frequently has disturbing consequences. Relief is not restricted to that which will be pleasing and free of irritation.</p>\n<p id=\"b157-14\">But the Court also made clear in its opinion that an equally significant basis for its denial of reinstatement was the award of $20,000.00 in lieu of several years salary. Of course appellant cannot have the right to a consideration of reinstatement on proper grounds without allowing the District Court to weigh all of the factors leading to the remedy ultimately chosen. Consequently the whole judgment, insofar as it prescribed a remedy, must be vacated. The District Court should fully reconsider its remedy in light of our ruling that the basis stated was impermissible. We express no view on what that remedy should be.</p>\n<p id=\"b157-16\">Vacated and remanded.</p>\n<footnote label=\"1\">\n<p id=\"b157-8\">. Sterzing v. Fort Bend Independent School District, S.D.Tex., 1972, 376 F.Supp. 657.</p>\n</footnote>\n<footnote label=\"2\">\n<p id=\"b157-9\">. After exhaustion of his administrative remedies, Sterzing filed this civil rights action basing jurisdiction on 42 U.S.C.A. \u00a7 1983 and 28 U.S.C.A. \u00a7 1343(3) seeking both monetary damages and the equitable relief of reinstatement. His complaint named the Fort Bend Independent School District and all members of the board of trustees and the superintendent of the school district.</p>\n<p id=\"b157-10\">Since the Fort Bend Independent School District, \u201cunder Texas law, is in the nature of a municipality,\u201d Harkless v. Sweeny Independent School District, 5 Cir., 1970, 427 F.2d 319, 321, jurisdiction does not exist in a \u00a7 1983 civil rights action against the school district either for monetary damages or equitable relief under the recent case of City of Kenosha v. Bruno, 1973, 412 U.S. 507, 93 S.Ct. 2222, 37 L.Ed.2d 109. Of course the appropriate named school officials are \u201cpersons\u201d within \u00a7 1983 and there are no jurisdictional problems concerning these named party defendants.

Due to the defendants\u2019 abandonment of their cross-appeal, we need not determine nor do we intimate how we would rule on the District Court\u2019s basic finding of constitutional violation. We are confined solely to the issue of remedy.</p>\n</footnote>\n</opinion>\n</casebody>\n",
