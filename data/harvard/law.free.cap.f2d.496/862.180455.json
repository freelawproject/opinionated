We recognize the impact of N.L.R.B. v. Gissel Packing Co., 395 U.S. 575, 89 S.Ct. 1918, 23 L.Ed.2d 547 (1969), but do not find the rationale of that decision applicable to the facts of this ease. Rather the language of the Court of Appeals for the Fifth Circuit in N.L.R.B. v. American Cable Systems, Inc., 427 F.2d 446, 449 (1970), cert. den., 400 U.S. 957, 91 S.Ct. 356, 27 L.Ed.2d 266, is more appropriate. In the present case the language of the Fifth Circuit, 427 F.2d 449, describes the reasoning of the Board in ordering bargaining as a \u201ca litany, reciting conclusions by rote without factual explication.\u201d</p>\n<p id=\"b927-8\">It is, therefore, ordered that enforcement be granted only as to the Section 8(a)(1) violation, and is denied as to the alleged Section 8(a)(5) violation.</p>\n<footnote label=\"1\">\n<p id=\"b926-37\">. The Board\u2019s order is found at 188 N.L.R.B. No. 59.</p>\n</footnote>\n</opinion>\n</casebody>\n",
