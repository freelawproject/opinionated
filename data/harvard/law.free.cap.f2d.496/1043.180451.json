Medical testimony established that death was caused by strangulation by hands and ligature such as a cord or wire. There were apparently no eyewitnesses to the murder, and police found no fingerprints or other physical evidence with which they could positively identify the perpetrator.</p>\n<p id=\"b1108-14\">At about noon on the day of the murder petitioner Daniel Grant, who for several months had been an employee in the Nudels\u2019 shop, was picked up and taken to the police department\u2019s homicide bureau. The parties are not in complete agreement as to what happened thereafter; however, considering \u201conly the uncontested portions of the record: the evidence of the prosecution\u2019s witnesses and so much of the evidence for the defense as, fairly read in the context of the record as a whole, remains uncontradicted,\u201d Culombe v. Connecticut, 1961, 367 U.S. 568, 604, 81 S.Ct. 1860, 1880, 6 L.Ed.2d 1037, a perhaps incomplete, but certainly unsavory, scenario emerges. Without being warned of his constitutional rights, Grant was questioned regarding his whereabouts that morning. When Grant explained that he had gone by the upholstery shop to borrow some money from Mr. Nudel, he was placed under arrest. From Saturday afternoon until Monday evening, some 53 hours, Grant was incarcerated without being taken before a magistrate. From 6:31 p. m. Monday until 2:00 a. m. Tuesday Grant was questioned intensively by relays of police officers.<footnotemark>1</footnotemark> During that seven and a half hour period Grant was left alone for only two brief intervals; in addition, his wife was brought in to talk to him for about thirty minutes. In the course of the interrogation petitioner was confronted by at least one person to whom he owed money. At approximately 1:20 a. m. Grant was told to take down his pants and to pull out and give to the detectives some of his own pubic hairs, presumably to compare with hairs found on the body of the deceased.<footnotemark>2</footnotemark> The suspect was then required to strip naked while Detectives Shepard and Utes conducted a \u201cphysical examination.\u201d Detective Holmes told Grant that two abrasions on his knees absolutely indicated his guilt. At that point \u2014 approximately <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"1045\">*1045</page-number>2:00 a. m. \u2014 Grant succumbed and confessed to the murder of Mrs. Nudel.<footnotemark>3</footnotemark></p>\n<p id=\"b1109-5\">The detectives called a police department stenographer to come to the station, and Grant concluded his formal statement of confession at 2:30 a. m. The statement was then typed, and it was read to and signed by Grant. From that time until about 5:15 a. m. Grant remained in the presence of his accusers and was not permitted to sleep. He was then taken by police officers to the Nudels\u2019 upholstery shop and was asked to reenact his confession. After a \u201cdry run\u201d or rehearsal, a movie of the performance was taken, with Grant in jail or prison garb acting the role of the murderer and with a detective playing the role of the victim. Over defense counsel\u2019s strenuous objections, this enacted \u201cconfession\u201d was shown to the jury at Grant\u2019s trial.</p>\n<p id=\"b1109-27\">On July 11, 1961, some two weeks after the initial confessions, petitioner, who was still incarcerated, complained of headaches and asked to see a doctor. In response the State Attorney\u2019s Office sent Dr. Harry Moscowitz, a psychiatrist, to examine Grant. Dr. Moscowitz testified at trial that he \u201cfollowed the usual format of a psychiatric examination.\u201d He determined that the headaches had begun when Grant found a cockroach in his ear and were not of a neurological-psychiatric nature. The psychiatrist then engaged Grant in a <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"1046\">*1046</page-number>discussion about why he was in jail and elicited from him a description of the murder that conformed substantially to the initial confession. The state presented Dr. Moscowitz as a witness at Grant\u2019s trial, and over strong defense objections, offered Grant\u2019s statements to Moscowitz as a third \u201cconfession.\u201d</p>\n<p id=\"b1110-4\">Primarily on the basis of the three confessions, Grant was convicted upon a trial by jury in December 1961 for first degree murder and was sentenced to death. The conviction was affirmed by the Supreme Court of Florida, with two Justices dissenting. Grant v. State, Fla.1965, 171 So.2d 361. The present appeal is from an order of the United States District Court for the Southern District of Florida dismissing, without a hearing, Grant\u2019s petition for writ of habeas corpus. Petitioner asks that we reverse the district court\u2019s order and grant the writ on the grounds that: (1) all three of the confessions were involuntary and their admission into evidence was a denial of due process; (2) admission of the filmed reenactment into evidence at trial was so highly prejudicial and inflammatory as to deny petitioner his constitutional right to a fair trial; and (3) the state trial court erroneously and harmfully limited inquiry by defense counsel into an alleged confession by Mr. Nudel. We agree with petitioner that the confessions upon which he was convicted were involuntary and that he is therefore in custody in violation of the Constitution. Because petitioner is entitled to relief on this ground, we do not reach the other issues raised on appeal.</p>\n<p id=\"b1110-5\">In the landmark decision of Miranda v. Arizona, 1966, 384 U.S. 436, 86 S.Ct. 1602, 16 L.Ed.2d 694, the Supreme Court delineated specific procedures to safeguard the Fifth Amendment privilege against self-incrimination during in-custody interrogations. If Daniel Grant\u2019s trial had taken place after the date of the <em>Miranda </em>decision, the involuntariness and inadmissibility of his confessions would be established beyond peradventure. We recognize that the strict requirements of <em>Miranda </em>are not to be applied retroactively. Johnson v. New Jersey, 1966, 384 U.S. 719, 86 S.Ct. 1772, 16 L.Ed.2d 882. <em>Miranda, </em>however, neither invoked a miracle nor marked the genesis of judicial vigilance prior to which the courts were oblivious to overzealous and abusive police interrogation practices. That decision was simply a milestone in the steady advance of Anglo-Saxon jurisprudence in the civilized treatment of the criminally accused. Only five years after the Wickersham Commission aroused public consciousness with its famous report on police abuses,<footnotemark>4</footnotemark> the Supreme Court reversed a Mississippi conviction based on confessions obtained by whipping the accused with a buckle-adorned leather strap. Brown v. Mississippi, 1936, 297 U.S. 278, 56 S.Ct. 461, 80 L.Ed. 682. In his forceful opinion for the Court, Chief Justice Hughes served notice \u2014 thirty years before <em>Miranda </em>\u2014 that \u201c[t]he rack and the torture chamber may not be substituted for the witness stand,\u201d 297 U.S. at 285-286, and that these and other barbaric paraphernalia designed to extract and extort confessions would be denounced and proscribed when evidenced.</p>\n<p id=\"b1110-7\">Although the facts of subsequent cases never reached the level of brutality of the beatings in <em>Brown, </em>the Court continued to scrutinize confessions. The Supreme Court long \u201chas recognized that coercion can be mental as well as physical, and that the blood of the accused is not the only hallmark of an unconstitutional inquisition.\u201d Blackburn v. Alabama, 1960, 361 U.S. 199, 206, 80 S.Ct. 274, 279, 4 L.Ed.2d 242. As the Court noted in Spano v. New York, 1959, 360 U.S. 315, 321, 79 S.Ct. 1202, 1206, 3 L.Ed.2d 1265,</p>\n<blockquote id=\"b1110-8\">as law enforcement officers become more responsible, and the methods <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"1047\">*1047</page-number>used to extract confessions more sophisticated, our duty to enforce federal constitutional protections does not cease. It only becomes more difficult because of the more delicate judgments to be made.</blockquote>\n<p id=\"b1111-5\">Writing for the majority in Davis v. North Carolina, 1966, 384 U.S. 737, 740, 86 S.Ct. 1761, 1764, 16 L.Ed.2d 895, Chief Justice Warren declared that</p>\n<blockquote id=\"b1111-6\">the nonretroactivity of the decision in <em>Miranda </em>does not affect the duty of courts to consider claims that a statement was taken under circumstances which violate the standards of voluntariness which had begun to evolve long prior to our decisions in <em>Miranda </em>and Escobedo v. Illinois, 378 U.S. 478 [84 S.Ct. 1758, 12 L.Ed.2d 977] (1964). This Court has undertaken to review the voluntariness of statements obtained by police in state cases since Brown v. Mississippi .... The standard of voluntariness which has evolved in state cases under the Due Process Clause of the Fourteenth Amendment is the same general standard which applied in federal prosecutions \u2014 a standard grounded in the policies of the privilege against self-incrimination. Malloy v. Hogan, 378 U. S. 1, 6-8 [84 S.Ct. 1489, 1492-1493, 12 L.Ed.2d 653] (1964).</blockquote>\n<p id=\"b1111-7\">Thus, \u201cvoluntariness\u201d was not a new word introduced by <em>Miranda </em>into our jurisprudential lexicon, and the prospectivity of that decision did not bless all previous confessions. <em>See generally </em>Developments in the Law \u2014 Confessions, 79 Harv.L.Rev. 935, 938-1036 (1966).</p>\n<p id=\"b1111-8\"> The test for admissibility of a confession in a <em>pre-Miranda </em>case is whether, considering the \u201ctotality of the circumstances,\u201d the defendant\u2019s statements were voluntary. Clewis v. Texas, 1967, 386 U.S. 707, 708, 87 S.Ct. 1338, 18 L.Ed.2d 423; Fikes v. Alabama, 1957, 352 U.S. 191, 197, 77 S.Ct. 281, 1 L.Ed.2d 246. Such a standard is, of course, easier to state than to apply. We know of no simple measuring device that would enable us to compare the relative reliability of confessions, the relative outrageousness of interrogation techniques, or the relative extent to which the wills of accused persons have been overborne. The variety of methods used to extract confessions, and the number of possible combinations and permutations of those methods, render any linear comparison impossible. Thus, we cannot say that Grant\u2019s incarceration for at least 53 hours without being taken before a magistrate renders his confession involuntary <em>per se, </em>even though the Supreme Court has reversed a state court finding of voluntariness when the accused was incarcerated only- some 38 hours before being charged. Clewis v. Texas, <em>supra; see also </em>Darwin v. Connecticut, 1968, 391 U.S. 346, 88 S.Ct. 1488, 20 L.Ed.2d 630. Similarly, we cannot hold the confession involuntary <em>solely </em>on the ground that Grant was subjected to intensive interrogation for seven and a half hours by relays of white police officers. Nevertheless, when the extended confinement and the exhaustive questioning are considered together and in combination with the confrontation by a creditor, the demand that petitioner pull out his own pubic hairs, and the early morning physical examination followed by the officer\u2019s authoritative statement that abrasions on petitioner\u2019s knees proved his guilt, there can be no doubt that the resulting confession was involuntary.</p>\n<p id=\"b1111-10\">In reaching our conclusion we are not unmindful of the substantial weight that is to be accorded to state court determinations. However, as Justice Frankfurter wrote for the Court five years before the <em>Miranda </em>decision,</p>\n<blockquote id=\"b1111-11\">where, on the uncontested external happenings, coercive forces set in motion by state law enforcement officials are unmistakably in action; where these forces, under all the prevailing states of stress, are powerful enough to draw forth a confession; where, in fact, the confession does come forth and is claimed by the defendant to have been extorted from him; and where he has acted as a <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"1048\">*1048</page-number>man would act who is subjected to such . an extracting process \u2014 where this is all that appears in the record \u2014a State\u2019s judgment that the confession was voluntary cannot stand.</blockquote>\n<p id=\"b1112-4\">Culombe v. Connecticut, <em>supra, </em>367 U.S. at 605. The tactics employed by police officers in extracting a confession from Grant in 1961 were just the type of procedures that led to the decisions in <em>Miranda </em>and in Escobedo v. Illinois, 1964, 378 U.S. 478, 84 S.Ct. 1758, 12 L.Ed.2d 977. These extractive techniques shock our pre as well as our <em>post-Miranda </em>consciences. A confession induced by such tactics cannot be considered voluntary under any standard and should not have been admitted as evidence to establish petitioner\u2019s guilt.</p>\n<p id=\"b1112-5\">The second and third \u201cconfessions\u201d \u2014 the filmed reenactment of the crime and the statement to the psychiatrist \u2014 cannot be separated from the circumstances surrounding the first confession, and they too must be held inadmissible. The reenactment was staged at approximately 5:00 a. m., only a couple of hours after the initial confession; petitioner, who had been questioned intensively for the entire evening and night, had no opportunity to sleep before being taken to the scene of the crime. Whether or not these features might have prevented the screenplay from being denominated a four-star cinematic production of Academy Award standards, they should at best have required the movie to be X-rated and banned from use in the courtroom for confession purposes.</p>\n<p id=\"b1112-9\">Although Grant\u2019s inculpatory statements to Dr. Moscowitz followed the initial confession and reenactment by two weeks, Grant had been in jail for the entire period. The record gives no indication that petitioner had spoken with counsel at any time during those two weeks or that any other event or circumstance had intervened that might isolate the encounter with the psychiatrist from the effects of the prior confessions.</p>\n<blockquote id=\"b1112-10\">As the Supreme Court has observed, after an accused has once let the cat out of the bag by confessing, no matter what the inducement, he is never thereafter free of the psychological and practical disadvantages of having confessed. He can never get the cat back in the bag. The secret is out for good. In such a sense, a later confession always may be looked upon as fruit of the first.</blockquote>\n<p id=\"b1112-11\">United States v. Bayer, 1947, 331 U.S. 532, 540, 67 S.Ct. 1394, 1398, 91 L.Ed. 1654.<footnotemark>5</footnotemark> The Court in <em>Bayer, </em>sustaining a trial court\u2019s refusal to suppress a \u201csupplementary\u201d confession, declined to <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"1049\">*1049</page-number>adopt a <em>per se </em>rule that would permit one confession made \u201cunder circumstances which preclude its use, perpetually [to disable] the confessor from making a usable one after those conditions have been removed.\u201d 331 U.S. at 541. The second confession in <em>Bayer, </em>however, followed the involuntary one by six months, during which time the defendant was under only very limited restraint on a military base; before making the second statement the defendant was given fair warning that it might be used against him. In Clewis v. Texas, <em>supra, </em>the accused gave three confessions to police: the first on July 9, the day after his arrest; the second on July 12; and the third on July 17. For the four days preceding his final statement, Clewis was in the county jail, but was neither interrogated nor abused and was permitted adequate food and sleep. During questioning on July 17, however, he was not advised of his right to remain silent or to have counsel appointed. After finding Clewis\u2019 first two confessions involuntary because of impermissible interrogation techniques, the Court concluded:</p>\n<blockquote id=\"b1113-5\">On this record, we cannot hold that petitioner\u2019s third statement was voluntary. It plainly cannot, on these facts, be separated from the circumstances surrounding the two earlier \u201cconfessions.\u201d There is here no break in the stream of events from the time Sunday morning when petitioner was taken to the police station to the time Tuesday morning some nine days later that he signed the statement in issue, sufficient to insulate the statement from the effect of all that went before.</blockquote>\n<p id=\"b1113-6\">Clewis v. Texas, <em>supra, </em>386 U.S. at 710. <em>See also </em>Darwin v. Connecticut, <em>supra; </em>Beecher v. Alabama, 1967, 389 U.S. 35, 88 S.Ct. 189, 19 L.Ed.2d 35. Our examination of the record of Daniel Grant\u2019s interrogation and detention convinces us that, as in the ordeal of Marvin Clewis, there was \u201cno break in the stream of events . . . sufficient to insulate\u201d Grant\u2019s statement to Dr. Moscowitz from the kaleidoscopic \u201ceffect of all that went before.\u201d Indeed, the involuntariness of Grant\u2019s final statement is greatly increased by the fact that it was induced by one who was represented to the prisoner as a doctor to treat his headaches, but who was actually a psychiatrist sent by the State Attorney\u2019s Office and who was following \u201cthe usual format of a psychiatric examination.\u201d <em>Cf. </em>Leyra v. Denno, 1954, 347 U.S. 556, 559-560, 74 S.Ct. 716, 98 L.Ed. 948.</p>\n<p id=\"b1113-10\">Judges as well as law enforcement authorities must always remain vigilant lest we forget the sage admonition of Chief Justice Warren regarding the use of abusive practices to obtain confessions :</p>\n<blockquote id=\"b1113-11\">The abhorrence of society to the use of involuntary confessions does not turn alone on their inherent untrustworthiness. It also turns on the deep-rooted feeling that the police must obey the law while enforcing the law; that in the end life and liberty can be as much endangered from illegal methods used to convict those thought to be criminals as from the actual criminals themselves.</blockquote>\n<p id=\"b1113-12\">Spano v. New York, <em>supra, </em>360 U.S. at 320-321. Petitioner Grant\u2019s \u201cconfessions\u201d were in no sense voluntary, and they should not have been admitted as evidence against him. Because petitioner\u2019s detention is in violation of the Constitution of the United States, he is entitled to be released. We therefore reverse the judgment of the district court and remand with instructions to grant the petition for writ of habeas corpus, subject to the right of the State, if it wishes to do so, to retry petitioner on the indictment here involved within ninety days after the mandate of this Court reaches the district court.</p>\n<p id=\"b1113-13\">Reversed.</p>\n<footnote label=\"1\">\n<p id=\"b1108-11\">. At least five officers, all of whom are white, were involved in the interrogation. Petitioner is black.</p>\n</footnote>\n<footnote label=\"2\">\n<p id=\"b1108-15\">. No evidence related to any such comparison was ever introduced at trial.</p>\n</footnote>\n<footnote label=\"3\">\n<p id=\"b1109-6\">. We emphasize that our synopsis of facts is based solely on undisputed testimony or, in instances of conflicting testimony, on the version of events offered by prosecution witnesses. Under questioning by his attorney at trial, Grant presented a much more pungent account of the moments leading up to his confession:</p>\n<blockquote id=\"b1109-7\">Q In other words, from 6:00 o\u2019clock at night until 12:00 you were under this repeated questioning?</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b1109-8\">A Yes.</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b1109-9\">Q By relays of detectives?</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b1109-10\">A Yes.</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b1109-11\">Q And there were about seven or eight of them?</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b1109-12\">A That is right.</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b1109-13\">Q What happened after that?</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b1109-14\">A Well, one of the detectives told me\u2014 He said that they would either get what they wanted one way or the other.</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b1109-15\">Q What did they mean by that?</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b1109-16\">A That, I didn\u2019t know at the time.</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b1109-17\">Q What did you find out subsequently, if anything, what they meant by that?</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b1109-18\">A After then they made me pull off my clothes. Detective Shepard came in and made me pull off all my clothes. He had me standing up and he cursed me and said a few different words to me, and he shoved me into the big chair that he was sitting in, and he called me all kinds of names and Detective Utes\u2014</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b1109-19\">Q At this time you were naked?</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b1109-20\">A Yes.</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b1109-21\">Q All right.</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b1109-22\">A And Detective Nichols brought in some rope and\u2014</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b1109-23\">Q What kind of rope?</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b1109-24\">A It was sash cord, I believe it was.</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b1109-25\">Q All right.</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"Aqv2\">A And Detective Utes had a piece about four feet long, I guess it was, and he had it around my neck and was pulling on it, and Detective Shepard he had a rope, and he made me tie it around my balls, he put his feet up against the desk and he was pulling on it.</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b1109-29\">Q Were they at this time, while this was going on, interrogating you?</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b1109-30\">A Yes.</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b1109-31\">Q What happened?</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b1109-32\">A It kept going until I couldn\u2019t stand it no more.</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b1109-33\">* * :}: sje sje</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b1109-34\">Q What then happened, Daniel, if anything?</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b1109-35\">A Detective Shepard was still holding the rope and Detective Utes took his rope off, and he went in and got the pictures and he showed it to me, and he asked me didn\u2019t I do it, and I said, \u201cNo,\u201d and Detective Shepard was pulling on the rope, and he said, \u201cYou might as well admit it, because I am going to pull until you do; \u201d so he kept pulling it.</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b1109-36\">Q And you then confessed?</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b1109-37\">A Until I couldn\u2019t take any more, and I confessed.</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b1109-38\">Q Is that confession true in any way?</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b1109-39\">A No, sir.</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b1109-40\">Q Why did you mak it Daniel?</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b1109-41\">A Because I was afraid and they were hurting me.</blockquote>\n<p id=\"b1109-42\">Transcript, pp. 478-80. Petitioner\u2019s description of the interrogation was contradicted by several participating police officers. We assume that the state court resolved the credibility choices in favor of the prosecution, <em>of. </em>La Vallee v. Rose, 1973, 410 U.S. 690, 692, 93 S.Ct. 1203, 35 L.Ed.2d 637; therefore, on this appeal we place no reliance on petitioner\u2019s disputed testimony.</p>\n</footnote>\n<footnote label=\"4\">\n<p id=\"b1110-10\">. U.S. National Comm\u2019n on Law Observance and Enforcement, Report on Lawlessness in Law Enforcement (1931).</p>\n</footnote>\n<footnote label=\"5\">\n<p id=\"b1112-6\">. The impact of the original confession may be just as great when the initial confession was false and did not actually involve \u201cletting the cat out of the bag.\u201d This would be particularly true where, as here, the accused has not only repeated his confession but has also reenacted his alleged crime several times for the benefit of law enforcement authorities. In his study of the psychology of confessions, Professor Edwin Driver explained the coercive effect of this type of repetition:</p>\n<blockquote id=\"b1112-7\">The tactics of having the suspect \u201crepeat his story over and over\u201d and asking him to try to fill in the details of the crime which has only been described to him in outline are manipulations towards self-persuasion, not necessarily attempts to trip up the suspect in lies. Eor if duped into playing the part of the criminal in an imaginary sociodrama, the suspect may come to believe that he was the central actor in the real crime. Experiments indicate that oververbalization in role playing increases the effectiveness of an effort at persuasion in two ways. Eirst, the actor may be impressed by his own arguments, illustrations, and appeals; and, second, he may experience a sense of achievement or satisfaction with bis own performance. More shocking perhaps is that if a play-acting confession is made in the presence of certain \u201ctruth signals,\u201d the suspect may later have difficulty accurately recalling what in fact happened . . . . Thus, a suspect accustomed to telling the truth to large, kindly, persistent men or used to responding truthfully to innocuous introductory questions may have his memory seriously clouded, or even may come to believe the false statements he makes in this context.</blockquote>\n<p id=\"b1112-14\">Driver, Confessions and the Social Psychology of Coercion, 82 Harv.L.Rev. 42, 53-54 (1968).</p>\n</footnote>\n</opinion>\n</casebody>\n",
