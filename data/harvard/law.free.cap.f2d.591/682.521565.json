PER CURIAM:</author>\n<p id=\"b757-15\">This case comes before the court on plaintiff\u2019s request, filed May 26,1978, for review by the court of the recommended decision of Trial Judge George Willi, filed May 2, 1978, pursuant to Rule 166(c) on plaintiff\u2019s motion and defendant\u2019s cross-motion for summary judgment, having been submitted to the court on the briefs and oral argument of counsel. Upon consideration thereof, since the court agrees with the trial judge\u2019s recommended decision, as hereinafter set forth, it hereby affirms and adopts the decision as the basis for its judgment in this case. Accordingly, plaintiff\u2019s motion for summary judgment is denied, defendant\u2019s cross-motion for summary judgment is granted and plaintiff\u2019s petition is dismissed.</p>\n<p id=\"b757-16\">OPINION OF TRIAL JUDGE<footnotemark>*</footnotemark></p>\n<author id=\"b757-17\">WILLI, <em>Trial Judge:</em></author>\n<p id=\"A4k\">By this suit plaintiff<footnotemark>1</footnotemark> challenges the correctness, subject to the finality standards of the Wunderlich Act, 41 U.S.C. \u00a7\u00a7 321-22 (1970), of a decision<footnotemark>2</footnotemark> by the Armed Services Board of Contract Appeals (the Board) holding that plaintiff had breached the same price warranty provision of two consecutive requirements contracts for lift truck replacement parts.</p>\n<p id=\"b757-18\">Except for two instances to be identified, the facts that follow were not in dispute before the Board.<footnotemark>3</footnotemark></p>\n<p id=\"b758-3\"><page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"684\">*684</page-number>Historically, the Government obtained its replacement parts for plaintiff\u2019s equipment by advertising for bids on specific quantities of designated parts. Invariably, plaintiff proved to be the only bidder.</p>\n<p id=\"b758-4\">In 1966 the Government surveyed its past annual purchases under the above procedures and determined that the volume involved was sufficient to justify procurement by a single requirements contract, thereby eliminating the necessity for resort to a succession of individual contracts of a largely repetitive nature.</p>\n<p id=\"b758-5\">To initiate its new approach to parts procurement, the Defense Construction Supply Center (DCSC) directed a Request for Quotations (RFQ) to the plaintiff on June 24, 1966. That document consisted essentially of the framework of the requirements contract that DCSC proposed to let, interspersed with appropriately placed blanks for plaintiff\u2019s insertion of its quotations. It also included certain supplementary questions to be answered by plaintiff in amplification of the quotations that it advanced. Those portions of the RFQ relating to price will be later detailed.</p>\n<p id=\"b758-6\">Plaintiff did not respond to the RFQ until January 26, 1967, following a telephone inquiry by a DCSC contract negotiator, Mr. Raabe, to plaintiff\u2019s Government Service Order Administrator, Mr. Fiorentino. In a letter of that date Mr. Fiorentino stated that he was transmitting two copies of plaintiff\u2019s \u201ccurrent price list, form 4309,\u201d adding that if DCSC found those prices acceptable, subject to appropriate adjustment for delivery and special packaging charges, plaintiff would then execute and return the RFQ.</p>\n<p id=\"b758-7\">Before the Board there was a dispute as to the content of the price lists that Mr. Fiorentino forwarded to DCSC. Both Mr. Fiorentino and Mr. Raabe testified, the former asserting that the material included a cover sheet that identified the scheduled prices as suggested dealer resale prices and the latter denying that any cover sheets were received. In the absence of contradictory proof apart from Mr. Fiorentino\u2019s testimony, the Board chose to believe Mr. Raabe\u2019s version of the facts. On that state of the record, the Board\u2019s finding cannot be said to lack the support of substantial evidence. It must, therefore, be accorded finality in the present proceeding.</p>\n<p id=\"b758-9\">It is not disputed that the cover sheet was the only part of price list 4309 that identified the prices appearing thereon as suggested dealer resale prices.</p>\n<p id=\"b758-10\">On February 24, 1967, plaintiff returned the RFQ, signed by its controller, to DCSC. Set forth below are the portions of it relevant to the question of price.</p>\n<p id=\"b758-11\">Article I of the Special Terms and Conditions proposed for inclusion in the contract provided as follows:<footnotemark>4</footnotemark></p>\n<blockquote id=\"b758-12\">SCOPE OF CONTRACT</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b758-13\">A.

The contract, effective October 1, 1967, was renewable annually at the Government\u2019s option to a maximum term of 3 years. The Government exercised that option and the parties operated under the terms of the contract until it was superseded in May 1970 by a successor requirements contract containing similar terms.</p>\n<p id=\"b760-7\">The successor contract, No. DSA-700-70D-0061, was also initiated by DCSC\u2019s issuance of an RFQ to the plaintiff. This was done on May 26, 1969, and plaintiff returned it in executed form on June 27, 1969. Insofar as pertinent here, the RFQ contained all of the provisions that were in the one that led to the original contract and, in addition, an expanded version of the required STATEMENT AS TO ESTABLISHED CATALOG PRICES, as earlier set forth herein. The addition was as follows:</p>\n<blockquote id=\"ASg\">9. The following data will be treated as confidential by the Government.

Are the discounts offered to sellers in b(3) above conditioned on maintaining specified minimum stock and/or other conditions ( ) Yes ( ) No. If yes, what are established m\u00ednimums and other conditions?</blockquote>\n<p id=\"b760-29\">Leaving the above portion completely unanswered, plaintiff entered the same information on this RFQ as it had on the first one. Again, its price quotations were as contained in the current edition of price list 4309. This time, however, DCSC received the identifying cover sheet as a part of plaintiff\u2019s price list submission. Upon examining the RFQ, as proffered by plaintiff, DCSC\u2019s contract negotiator was unable to reconcile a quotation of dealer resale prices with plaintiff\u2019s affirmative statement elsewhere in the RFQ to the effect that no discount from those prices would be granted. In addition, plaintiff\u2019s failure to respond to the price list inquiries set forth in the quotation immediately above increased the negotiator\u2019s skepticism. She therefore telephoned Mr. Fiorentino to obtain an explanation and to ascertain specifically whether it was actually plaintiff\u2019s intention to deny the Government a discount from <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"687\">*687</page-number>the suggested dealer resale prices that it had quoted. The negotiator testified that Mr. Fiorentino informed her that plaintiff did allow \u201cstocking dealers\u201d a discount from suggested resale price to cover transportation, handling and inventory costs, adding that he did not know the precise amount of the discount but would check into the matter and advise her accordingly. The DCSC negotiator testified that after several months passed with no word from Mr. Fiorentino, she telephoned him again and was advised that he had been mistaken in his impression that dealers were allowed discounts from the 4309 list prices. He assured her that those were the net prices to everyone. The Board found that the negotiator accepted that assurance and on the strength of it recommended award of a successor contract to the plaintiff, with terms to be as set forth in the RFQ. The DCSC negotiator\u2019s testimony, corroborated by plaintiff\u2019s affirmative representations in the RFQ (as well as by its failure to provide answers to direct questions in the RFQ that would have fully disclosed its commercial pricing practices) and contradicted only by that of Mr. Fiorentino, fully qualifies as substantial evidence amply sufficient to support the Board findings that were based on it.</p>\n<p id=\"b761-4\">In 1971 the DCSC contracting officer for plaintiff\u2019s follow-on contract then in force learned from a Federal Supply Schedule published by the General Services Administration that one of plaintiff\u2019s franchised dealers was offering to sell the Government replacement parts at 2 percent less than the prices that plaintiff was charging DCSC. Pointing to the price warranty clause in the requirements contract, the contracting officer wrote plaintiff proposing a 2 percent price discount on all orders placed after April 1,1971. Plaintiff refused, contending that since dealers were not end-users the prices charged them were not relevant comparatives within the meaning of the warranty clause. In July 1972, the contracting officer rendered a final decision finding plaintiff in breach of the price warranty clause and demanding payment of a 2 percent rebate on all orders placed with it after April 1, 1971. Shortly thereafter DCSC learned that, in fact, plaintiff\u2019s uniform practice had been to sell to its dealers at a discount of 25 percent from the suggested resale prices set forth in the list 4309 that was the pricing basis for both requirements contracts. In the face of that information the contracting officer under the original contract issued a final decision to the effect that the price warranty clause required plaintiff to extend DCSC the same discount that it applied to its dealers.</p>\n<p id=\"b761-6\">On plaintiff\u2019s appeal, the Board upheld both contracting officers\u2019 decisions.</p>\n<p id=\"b761-7\">Plaintiff\u2019s central contention in its current effort to upset the Board\u2019s determination is that its franchised dealers are not \u201ccustomers\u201d within the meaning of the price warranty clause because under normal trade parlance and usage a customer is an end-user and not, like a dealer, one who is obliged to perform service functions in relation to products that he buys for eventual resale to an end-user. Whatever the merit of this contention, viewed in the abstract, it is completely incompatible with the undisputed facts of this case.</p>\n<p id=\"b761-8\">Under direct examination by plaintiff\u2019s attorney, its pricing manager, Mr. Thomas, gave the following account of the independent status of the franchised dealers and their relative prominence in its sale of replacement parts:</p>\n<blockquote id=\"b761-9\">Q. Can you break down, again in rough percentages, the percent of parts sold to dealers as opposed to all other purchasers?</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b761-10\">A. 95 percent would be sold to dealers.</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b761-11\">Q. Of all parts sales?</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b761-12\">A. Yes.</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b761-13\">Q. This may be a little out of your area, but from what you know could you briefly describe the dealer system and how it works?</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b761-14\">A. The dealer system, briefly from my experience, is a company sales oriented to sell industrial trucks.</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b761-15\">It is a franchise system independently owned by them. They set their own sala<page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"688\">*688</page-number>ry figures, quotations, and in general carry on as independent businessmen.</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b762-4\">In our case it is designed primarily for the sale of Industrial Trucks and it is supporting activity such as used equipment and rental of equipment.</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b762-5\">Q. Is the relationship merely one of seller and purchaser or is it more extensive than that?</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b762-6\">A. I would say it is seller and purchaser.</blockquote>\n<p id=\"b762-7\">To suggest, as plaintiff does, that the independent purchasers to whom it sells no less than 95 percent of its replacement parts are not its \u201ccustomers\u201d for those parts simply defies commercial reality. Moreover, in its dealings with DCSC plaintiff itself characterized those dealers as its customers when it responded to the questionnaire portion of the RFQs directed to its dealer resale price list by representing that list 4309 is regularly maintained and published by it for inspection by its \u201ccustomers.\u201d</p>\n<p id=\"b762-8\">Though, as previously indicated (note 2, supra), plaintiff is not challenging the Board\u2019s subsequent decision on damages, it is worth noting that it was not required to extend DCSC the 25 percent discount that it regularly allowed dealers on routine purchases of parts for replenishment of their inventories. Instead, a discount of 15 percent was approved, that being the same discount allowed dealers on special purchases of parts that they would not be required to inventory because they had immediate sale for them. In the circumstances of this case that overall result is eminently just and proper.</p>\n<p id=\"b762-9\">CONCLUSION</p>\n<p id=\"b762-10\">For the reasons given, plaintiff\u2019s motion for summary judgment is denied, defendant\u2019s motion for summary judgment granted, and the petition dismissed.</p>\n<footnote label=\"*\">\n<p id=\"b757-9\"> The opinion and recommended conclusion of law are submitted pursuant to Rule 166(c).
