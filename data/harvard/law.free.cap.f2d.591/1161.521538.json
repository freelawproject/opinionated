While serving a 22-year sentence for bank robbery, defendant escaped from a hospital where he had been temporarily housed for medical treatment, after which he was to be returned to the Atlanta Federal Penitentiary-</p>\n<p id=\"b1236-12\">Asserting duress or necessity as a defense, defendant claimed his escape was a direct result of his fear of being returned to the penitentiary where he allegedly had been and would be homosexually attacked by other inmates. Defendant argues the trial court erred when it: rejected that defense as a matter of law; refused to issue writs of habeas corpus ad testificandum to secure inmate witnesses to testify to assaults at the penitentiary; refused to prohibit disclosure of defendant\u2019s past convictions if he took the stand; charged the jury incorrectly regarding credibility of witnesses; and denied a mistrial when the prosecutor elicited a comment concerning defendant\u2019s post-arrest silence. Finding no merit in defendant\u2019s arguments, we affirm.</p>\n<p id=\"b1236-14\">With the assistance of a hospital worker defendant fled from the hospital and remained at large for six months before he was arrested and detained in a county jail in connection with a murder. He was subsequently returned to federal authorities.</p>\n<p id=\"b1236-15\">In response to the Government\u2019s motion to disallow defendant\u2019s proffered defense of duress or necessity and to quash certain subpoenas, the district court ruled defendant\u2019s duress defense unavailable as a matter of law since defendant had absented himself from custody for a period of six months. The district court correctly relied on the reasoning in <em>United States v. Michelson, </em>559 F.2d 567 (9th Cir. 1977), and quoted the following:</p>\n<blockquote id=\"b1236-16\">[A]n escape will not be excused by reason of duress if the escapee fails to submit to proper authorities immediately after attaining a position of safety. The inmate\u2019s failure to submit to proper authorities following the allegedly coerced escape amounts to an unexcused commission of the crime of escape. Therefore, when an escapee fails to submit to proper authorities, the asserted duress defense must be rejected because as a matter of law it does not negate the continued absence from custody.</blockquote>\n<p id=\"b1236-17\"><em>United States v. Michelson, supra </em>at 570.</p>\n<p id=\"b1236-18\">The theory of such a defense is that outside physical forces so powerfully influence a defendant that his actions cannot be considered voluntary. Once he has attained a position of safety, however, his actions can no longer be considered involuntary.</p>\n<p id=\"b1236-19\">Although defendant relies on the test set forth in <em>People v. Lovercamp, </em>43 Cal.App.3d 823, 832, 118 Cal.Rptr. 110, 115 (1974), he even fails to comply with virtually all of the <em>Lovercamp </em>requirements. The court in <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"1163\">*1163</page-number><em>Lovercamp </em>ruled duress could constitute a defense where:</p>\n<blockquote id=\"b1237-5\">(1) The prisoner is faced with a specific threat of death, forcible sexual attack or substantial bodily injury in the immediate future;</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b1237-6\">(2) There is no time for a complaint to the authorities or there exists a history of futile complaints which make any result from such complaints illusory;</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b1237-7\">(3) There is no time or opportunity to resort to the court;</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b1237-8\">(4) There is no evidence of force or violence used towards prison personnel or other \u201cinnocent\u201d persons in the escape; and</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b1237-9\">(5) The prisoner immediately reports to the proper authorities when he has attained a position of safety from the immediate threat.</blockquote>\n<p id=\"b1237-10\">In this case, defendant was in a position of safety at the hospital when he escaped, he was not faced with a specific threat, forcible sexual attack or substantial bodily injury in the immediate future, he had ample opportunity at the hospital to complain to authorities and to petition the court, he showed no history of having made unanswered complaints on prior occasions to those authorities, and he did not immediately report to authorities once he was out of reach of the alleged dangers.</p>\n<p id=\"b1237-11\">The other cases relied on by defendant are of no support to his duress argument. They involve substantially different facts and circumstances and do not apply here. <em>See, e. g., United States v. Bailey, </em>190 U.S.App.D.C. 142, 585 F.2d 1087 (1978), <em>petition for cert. filed, </em>47 U.S.L.W. 3437 (Dec. 18, 1978, No. 78-990); <em>United States v. Davis, </em>546 F.2d 583 (5th Cir.), <em>cert. denied, </em>431 U.S. 906, 97 S.Ct. 1701, 52 L.Ed.2d 391 (1977); <em>United States v. Harp, </em>536 F.2d 601 (5th Cir. 1976); <em>United States v. Chapman, </em>455 F.2d 746 (5th Cir. 1972).</p>\n<p id=\"b1237-12\">The court correctly determined there was no factual basis for defendant to raise a duress or necessity defense.</p>\n<p id=\"b1237-13\">This ruling controls the decision as to the district court\u2019s refusal to issue writs habeas corpus ad testificandum to secure the presence of inmate witnesses at trial. The prison conditions about which defendant\u2019s witnesses could testify, and his state of mind resulting therefrom, can be assumed, but defendant\u2019s failure to complain to authorities while he was in the hospital and his failure to contact authorities during the six-month period he was at large defeat his defense.</p>\n<p id=\"b1237-15\">Defendant had been previously convicted of escape, bank robbery, voluntary manslaughter, and murder. It was within the trial court\u2019s discretion to permit cross-examination as to defendant\u2019s past convictions for the purpose of impeachment, if defendant took the stand.</p>\n<p id=\"b1237-16\">The district court charged the jury, <em>inter alia, </em>to consider \u201cthe extent to which, if at all, each witness is either supported or contradicted by other evidence in the case.\u201d Defendant contends the charge placed a burden on defendant to contradict the Government\u2019s witnesses and deprived him of his Fifth Amendment rights. On review, we conclude the district court simply directed the jury\u2019s attention to the totality of the evidence in the case and committed no reversible error.</p>\n<p id=\"b1237-17\">Defendant contends the Government improperly commented on his post-arrest silence and deprived him of his constitutional right to remain silent. A Government agent testified that when he went to the jail after defendant\u2019s apprehension, defendant Bryan came to the cell door when the name Rodney B. Brown was called but said nothing. In this context, coupled with the district court\u2019s cautionary instruction, the response \u201cNothing\u201d in answer to the question \u201cWhat did he [defendant] tell you?\u201d did not violate defendant\u2019s constitutional right to remain silent.</p>\n<p id=\"b1237-18\">AFFIRMED.</p>\n</opinion>\n</casebody>\n",
