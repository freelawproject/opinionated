BROWN, Chief Judge:</author>\n<p id=\"b1080-4\">The Federal Energy Regulatory Commission (FERC) issued several opinions and orders<footnotemark>1</footnotemark> in which it (1) found Florida Gas Transmission Company\u2019s (FGT) gas curtailment plan to be unduly discriminatory and (2) disclaimed jurisdiction to order curtailment of gas FGT merely transports. In this case, several parties \u2014<footnotemark>2</footnotemark> aligning themselves in different camps on different issues \u2014 seek review of those opinions. While some argue that substantial evidence does not support the Commission\u2019s holdings, others insist that the Commission has erred in not immediately implementing its orders. Finding that it has struck a proper balance, we affirm the Commission on all points.</p>\n<p id=\"AU_\">FGT operates a natural gas pipeline that serves several areas of Florida. It sells both to distributors (who in turn sell to residential, commercial, and industrial customers) and directly to some large industrial concerns.<footnotemark>3</footnotemark> It also transports gas for two major electric generating companies, Florida Power Corporation (FP) and Florida Power and Light (FPL), both of which buy large amounts of gas in Texas.<footnotemark>4</footnotemark></p>\n<p id=\"b1080-12\">FGT has fixed various rate schedules and degrees of reliability of service in its sales contracts. Wholesale distributors may purchase gas under the G schedule, which provides firm general service, and the I schedule,<footnotemark>5</footnotemark> which offers gas for resale to preferred interruptible resale customers. Direct customers may also purchase either <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"1007\">*1007</page-number>interruptible<footnotemark>6</footnotemark> or firm service.<footnotemark>7</footnotemark> Under FGT\u2019s tariff,<footnotemark>8</footnotemark> in case of gas shortages, it will curtail deliveries to its customers in the following order:<footnotemark>9</footnotemark> (1) primary interruptible direct customers, (2) preferred interruptible direct, (3) distributors purchasing under schedule I, (4) firm direct industrial, (5) distributors purchasing under schedule G (for resale to firm customers).</p>\n<p id=\"b1081-5\">Prior to 1972, FGT contemplated \u2014 and experienced \u2014 only relatively short term curtailments of its interruptible customers. Because it did not foresee any gas supply shortage, it expected to deliver substantially all of its contract volumes. In 1973, however, FGT curtailed its direct interruptible customers twice as many days as it had in 1972. In 1974, that figure almost doubled again.<footnotemark>10</footnotemark></p>\n<p id=\"b1081-20\">On March 21, 1975 Lehigh Portland Cement Company,<footnotemark>11</footnotemark> a direct interruptible customer of FGT, filed a complaint under Section 5(a) of the Natural Gas Act<footnotemark>12</footnotemark> (the Act), asserting that FGT\u2019s curtailment plan unlawfully discriminates against direct industrials in favor of indirect industrials purchasing from distributors. It argued that because the plan curtails gas without re<page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"1008\">*1008</page-number>gard to end-use,<footnotemark>13</footnotemark> it should be found unjust, unreasonable, unduly discriminatory, and preferential. The Commission set the matter for formal hearing on its own motion, and on August 5, 1976, the Presiding Administrative Law Judge issued a decision dismissing the complaint.</p>\n<p id=\"b1082-4\">The Commission, however, reversed the ALJ in its Opinion No. 807. Announcing that \u201cthose who are similarly entitled must be treated equally regardless of their ability to survive otherwise,\u201d it found FGT\u2019s plan unduly discriminatory and ordered it to file a new plan that would provide equal treatment of direct and indirect customers who make similar use of the gas.<footnotemark>14</footnotemark> The Commission further ordered that FP and FPL be joined as parties so that all gas transported by FGT could be made part of the new plan.</p>\n<p id=\"b1082-5\">After several parties petitioned for rehearing, the Commission issued Opinion No. 807-A, which affirmed its previous holding that FGT\u2019s curtailment plan was no longer just and reasonable, but rescinded its order that the pipeline file a new plan. It instead determined that the existing curtailment should remain in effect until the \u00a7 5 hearing was completed or pending further Commission order. In addition, 807-A summarily reversed the Commission\u2019s prior decision to include the FP and FPL transportation gas in any new plan.<footnotemark>15</footnotemark> Numerous interested parties filed petitions for review in this Court.<footnotemark>16</footnotemark></p>\n<p id=\"b1082-10\">On January 18, 1977, in an independent proceeding, the Fort Pierce Utilities Authority of the City of Fort Pierce filed a petition and complaint. It requested (1) that the Commission order curtailments of the transportation gas on FGT\u2019s system, and (2) that the Commission condition further transportation upon FGT\u2019s curtailing the transportation volumes proportionately with those to which preferred interruptible customers would be otherwise entitled.<footnotemark>17</footnotemark> The Commission issued an order dismissing the claim on August 3, 1977, and denied rehearing on September 30, 1977. In both orders it found that it lacked the authority to grant the requested relief. It reasoned that because FGT does not own the transportation gas, it cannot allocate it. Moreover, legal title passes before the gas flows interstate. Again, several parties peti<page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"1009\">*1009</page-number>tioned this Court for review of the Commission orders.<footnotemark>18</footnotemark></p>\n<p id=\"b1083-5\"><em>Undue </em>Discrimination<footnotemark>19</footnotemark></p>\n<p id=\"b1083-6\">In attacking the Commission\u2019s finding, that FGT\u2019s plan is unduly discriminatory, petitioners<footnotemark>20</footnotemark> first contend that FERC evaluated FGT\u2019s curtailment plan against an incorrect standard, and that it improperly shifted the burden of proof in its proceedings. They cite the Commission\u2019s statement in Opinion 807, that \u201cthere is a heavy burden to show that a non-end-use plan is superior,\u201d and contend that it demonstrates that the Commission elevated its statement of policy \u2014 as announced in Order 467, favoring end-use considerations<footnotemark>21</footnotemark> \u2014 to a legal presumption. Moreover, it compelled the supporters of the status quo to prove that the plan met the standard rather than imposing the burden of proving violation on those seeking to change the curtailment.<footnotemark>22</footnotemark> Such arbitrary action,<footnotemark>23</footnotemark> they insist, merits reversal of the Commission\u2019s decision.</p>\n<p id=\"b1083-14\">We cannot agree. We think the Commission correctly applied the \u00a7 4(b) standard as it interpreted it.<footnotemark>24</footnotemark> An examination of Opinions 807 and 807-A reveals that the Commission initially found a preference unsupported by a reasonable basis for distinction, and <em>then </em>determined that an end-use plan would be appropriate for rem<page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"1010\">*1010</page-number>edying the discrimination.<footnotemark>25</footnotemark> In 807 it examined the similarities between two cement plants \u2014 one an indirect customer of FGT, the other a direct \u2014 and found no statutorily acceptable reason for the indirect customer\u2019s receiving almost twice as much FGT gas as the direct.<footnotemark>26</footnotemark> It made this finding before discussing \u201cthe necessity for an end-use plan.\u201d<footnotemark>27</footnotemark> In 807-A the Commission, apparently trying to clear up any confusion caused by Opinion 807, carefully delineated its two findings:</p>\n<blockquote id=\"b1084-4\">. the Commission said [(1)] that the [FGT curtailment plan] discriminates against its direct sale customers in favor of indirect customers, who receive gas on resale from distributing companies, and [(2)] that FGT must file a curtailment plan based on end-use of the gas providing equal treatment for direct and indirect customers making similar use of the gas.</blockquote>\n<p id=\"b1084-5\">Regarding the contention that the above-quoted sentence shows that the Commission shifted the burden of proving violation of the Act, we first emphasize that it made this statement while discussing the sort of plan FGT should submit in place of the present one. It had <em>already </em>found a violation of the Act. Next, we point to the Commission\u2019s answer to this very claim in Opinion 807-A, in which it said that</p>\n<blockquote id=\"b1084-12\">[w]e recognize that the complainant has the burden of proof and that Order No. 467-B merely states our policy. We think, however, that the <em>complainants have met their burden </em>of showing that while they operate in like manner as the indirect customers they receive a smaller share of gas.</blockquote>\n<p id=\"b1084-13\">Op. 807-A, slip op. at 7, emphasis added.</p>\n<p id=\"b1084-14\">Petitioners level their second attack against Opinions 807 and 807-A by arguing that, contrary to the Commission\u2019s findings, a reasonable basis did support the admitted discrimination.<footnotemark>28</footnotemark> They point to the history of the pipeline and the unique economic difficulties involved in supplying gas to Florida, contending that these factors militate against a change in the present system.</p>\n<p id=\"b1084-15\">Because Florida experiences generally mild weather conditions with occasional drastic changes in temperature, temperature sensitive loads may swing annually as much as about 800%. In order to serve these loads efficiently, therefore, FGT distributors had to sell to customers who would accept interruptible service. In other words, in order to maintain dependable deliveries to those serving residential and other high priority users, the pipeline had to develop an industrial market that would use large amounts of available gas but could be curtailed during gas shortages.<footnotemark>29</footnotemark> Thus, say <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"1011\">*1011</page-number>petitioners, the plan does work to protect high priority users.</p>\n<p id=\"b1085-4\">While we recognize \u2014 as does the Commission \u2014 that the present plan may favor some high-priority users,<footnotemark>30</footnotemark> we do not agree that discrimination against direct customers is necessary to secure this protection.<footnotemark>31</footnotemark> And although we accept the contention that industrial loads may be necessary to enable the pipeline and its distributor-customers efficiently to offer residential and commercial service, we cannot make the leap necessary to conclude that this necessity requires favoring distributor-supplied industrials over those who buy directly.</p>\n<p id=\"b1085-8\">Petitioners offer the argument that many of the distributors would face bankruptcy if they were curtailed to the extent that their industrial customers received gas supplies on an equal basis with direct industrials. Here, again, we agree with the Commission that there is now insufficient basis for such a contention. Until the FERC holds hearings specifically to study possible plans and their effects, assertions of adverse impact on particular distributors is speculation.<footnotemark>32</footnotemark> Moreover to the limited <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"1012\">*1012</page-number>extent that the record reflects the effect of the Commission\u2019s decision, it indicates that a 467 priority plan would provide to over seventy-five percent of the distributors on FGT\u2019s system more gas than they would have under the present tariff.<footnotemark>33</footnotemark></p>\n<p id=\"b1086-4\">Petitioners finally contend that Opinions 807 and 807-A are unlawful because direct and indirect customers \u2014 between which the Commission found undue discrimination \u2014 are not in the same class for the purposes of the Act. They are thus not legally comparable. Labeling the indirect industrials \u201cnon-customers,\u201d petitioners contend that the Commission should compare curtailment only between \u201ccustomers\u201d \u2014i. e., direct industrials and wholesale distributors. Since the <em>distributors </em>determine the extent of curtailment after <em>they </em>receive the gas, FGT\u2019s tariff does not determine the extent of curtailment to resale users.</p>\n<p id=\"b1086-5\">We have no trouble dispensing with these contentions. First of all, the Supreme Court has recognized Commission authority over curtailments of both direct and indirect customers. <em>FPC v. Louisiana Power and Light Co., </em>1972, 406 U.S. 621, 92 S.Ct. 1827, 32 L.Ed.2d 369. FGT\u2019s particular system of distribution has divided a group of similarly entitled<footnotemark>34</footnotemark> consumers into categories based on rates and dependability of service. It has also determined <em>when </em>indirect industrials will be served by creating a special rate schedule for indirect interruptible customers (most of which are industrial) and making it part of its curtailment priority order. Thus, by establishing the schedule I and G rates, the pipeline took an affirmative part in determining the flow of gas to indirect industrials. In such a situation, we cannot say that the Commission was unreasonable in making the comparison it did.<footnotemark>35</footnotemark></p>\n<p id=\"b1086-9\">\n<em>Immediate Implementation</em>\n</p>\n<p id=\"b1086-10\">Gardinier, Inc., a direct interruptible customer of FGT, also seeks review of Opinions 807 and 807-A, but with a different approach. While supporting the Commission\u2019s finding of an undue preference, it challenges the FERC\u2019s failure immediately to implement a substitute plan. It argues that \u00a7 5 mandates such immediate action and insists that both \u00a7\u00a7 5 and 4 offer the procedures. We will address the \u00a7 5 and \u00a7 4 arguments separately.</p>\n<p id=\"b1086-11\">Before going further, however, we must point out that a \u201creasonableness\u201d standard governs our consideration of this issue. If the Commission has acted reasonably \u2014 in light of the basic fact findings and record evidence \u2014 in ordering the existing plan to remain in effect pending \u00a7 5 hearings,<footnotemark>36</footnotemark> we must sustain its decision. <em>American Smelting, noted supra, </em>161 U.S.App.D.C. at 22, 494 F.2d at 941.</p>\n<p id=\"Aqta\"><page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"1013\">*1013</page-number>Section 5\u2019s mechanism for remedying discrimination in allocation of gas begins with the Commission\u2019s lawfully finding a \u00a7 4(b) violation. Upon such determination, the Commission will then impose its own plan, but only after a hearing and an administrative determination that the plan implemented is just and reasonable. <em>See Southern Natural Gas v. FPC, </em>5 Cir., 1977, 547 F.2d 826, 832. While, as Gardinier asserts, the Commission would have emergency authority \u2014 even when conducting a \u00a7 5 hearing \u2014 to prescribe an interim plan,<footnotemark>37</footnotemark> it can do so only after a full hearing.<footnotemark>38</footnotemark></p>\n<p id=\"b1087-5\">This hearing requirement, along with the lack of record evidence on various curtailment plans, marks the source of the Commission\u2019s reluctance to impose an interim plan. Since the structure of the fact finding proceedings before the ALJ effectively precluded presentation of data regarding possible alternative curtailment plans, the Commission maintains that it must develop a record before it can reasonably enforce compliance with any new system, end-use or otherwise. Speedy action without the benefit of data on costs and effects, says the Commission, might result in the implementation of a plan more discriminatory than that now in existence.</p>\n<p id=\"b1087-15\">The FERC agrees that it must remedy the discrimination (and denies petitioner\u2019s assertion that it is withholding relief). According to the Commission, the relief <em>Is </em>forthcoming, but in accordance with the procedural requirements of \u00a7 5.</p>\n<p id=\"b1087-16\">Gardinier asserts that the record does contain sufficient evidence to support temporary relief<footnotemark>39</footnotemark> and insists that \u00a7 5 absolutely requires such immediate action.<footnotemark>40</footnotemark> It points to decisions of several courts that have recognized the Commission\u2019s authority to issue interim curtailment orders<footnotemark>41</footnotemark> We do not think, though, that these acknowledgments of authority necessarily mean that the Commission has an affirmative duty to fashion interim relief in all cases. Indeed, the opinions petitioner cites all recognize the Commission\u2019s discretion in determining whether such relief is necessary.<footnotemark>42</footnotemark></p>\n<p id=\"b1087-17\">The <em>Consolidated Edison </em>cases,<footnotemark>43</footnotemark> cited by Gardinier, do not support its position. They <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"1014\">*1014</page-number>instead reinforce our finding that the Commission <em>may </em>formulate an interim plan under \u00a7 5. In <em>Consolidated Edison I </em>the District of Columbia Circuit found that a 467-type curtailment plan \u2014 submitted by Transcontinental Pipeline (Transco) \u2014 would have an extremely harsh impact on certain customers. It therefore temporarily replaced the submission with a settlement agreement, previously rejected by the Commission, negotiated between Transco and its customers. After having discussed the reasons for its action, the court added that \u201c[o]ur present action . . . in no way precludes the Commission from modifying the settlement or taking other action based on the information which it has generated . . ..***. . .the Commission asserts, and we agree, that it has residual emergency powers to impose an interim plan where there is no alternative.\u201d Warning that \u201c[sjuch powers must be carefully confined,\u201d it nevertheless found that the Commission \u2014 faced with an emergency shortage of gas and little possibility of formulating a permanent curtailment plan before winter \u2014 could effect such a plan.<footnotemark>44</footnotemark> By acknowledging the Commission\u2019s authority to act, while at the same time providing for the possibility that it would not institute interim measures, the court clearly recognized the Commission\u2019s <em>discretion </em>to fashion such relief.</p>\n<p id=\"b1088-7\">Similarly, in <em>Consolidated Edison II </em>the court reiterated its statement that \u201cthe FPC <em>might </em>issue interim curtailment orders <em>based on evidence compiled in hearings on a permanent plan.\u201d </em>(Emphasis added). It cautioned, however, that once the Commission instituted such relief, it \u201chas a responsibility to monitor whatever interim plan may be in effect pending a final decision, and to make such adjustments as may appear warranted. * * * Our decision today places heavy reliance on the Commission\u2019s conscientious discharge of its oversight function.\u201d 168 U.S.App.D.C. at 103, 512 F.2d at 1343. Thus, contrary to Gardinier\u2019s assertion that the Commission\u2019s oversight function compels it to institute interim relief, that function arises <em>with </em>the implementation of interim measures.</p>\n<p id=\"b1088-10\">Having found that the Commission indeed has discretion to impose an interim curtailment plan, we must now consider the question whether it has reasonably exercised this discretion. Gardinier, maintaining that the Commission has been unreasonable, attacks its stated reasons for not fashioning interim relief as \u201cfrivolous.\u201d The first of these reasons is the Commission\u2019s fear that a plan submitted in accordance with Opinion 807\u2019s order would be construed as a \u00a7 4 filing. Desiring to avoid the summary procedures involved with such filings<footnotemark>45</footnotemark> the Commission ordered that FGT submit a \u201ccase in chief\u201d rather than an actual curtailment plan.</p>\n<p id=\"b1088-11\">Gardinier criticizes this action, accusing the Commission of suffering from a basic misunderstanding of \u00a7 5. A plan so ordered, according to petitioner, would be a \u00a7 5 <em>compliance </em>filing. We agree that only \u00a7 5 allows the Commission to impose a particular plan. <em>Southern Natural Gas Co. v. FPC, </em>5 Cir., 1977, 547 F.2d 826, 832. We further acknowledge that if a pipeline files under coercion rather than voluntarily, the plan is invalid unless \u00a7 5 procedural requirements have been satisfied. <em>Consolidated Edison I, supra.</em></p>\n<p id=\"b1088-12\">But we fail to see how this renders the Commission\u2019s action unreasonable. Even under the 807 order, the Commission was not going to put FGT\u2019s proposal immediately into effect. It was going to conduct extensive hearings and supervise a detailed study in order to produce a just and reasonable final product. Assuming without deciding<page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"1015\">*1015</page-number><footnotemark>46</footnotemark> that the Commission misapprehended the effect of an ordered filing, we nevertheless find that that mistake would not necessarily have prejudiced petitioner. There is no indication.that FGT\u2019s proposal would have taken effect before the plan that FGT and the Commission will ultimately produce.</p>\n<p id=\"b1089-5\">The Commission also stated that it wished to avoid causing undue harm to schedule I customers of FGT-supplied distributors:</p>\n<blockquote id=\"b1089-6\">To impose a 467-B plan on their system and its distributors with their heavy dependence on the industrial load without adequate consideration of its effects at a hearing would in our opinion be reckless. Likewise we cannot properly take the half-step of requiring equal treatment of the direct preferred interruptible customers and the I customers because the record is not sufficient on the entitlements of the various customers or the impact on any but a few. Therefore, we shall not prescribe an interim plan at this time but will allow the present plan to remain in effect pending further Commission order.</blockquote>\n<p id=\"AUV\">Gardinier attacks this reasoning with the observation that all end-use plans, however implemented, necessarily curtail low-priority users most heavily. It further contends that the Commission\u2019s refusal immediately to impose such a plan is inconsistent with its stated policy of ensuring priority of delivery to residential and commercial consumers during gas shortages.</p>\n<p id=\"b1089-12\">If the Commission were truly concerned about possible economic harm to particular customers, continues Gardinier, it would have ordered expedited proceedings or have prescribed a plan with an invitation to seek special relief. Despite petitioner\u2019s concerns, we think that the Commission acted reasonably. The District of Columbia Circuit has recognized that a 467-type curtailment can have an unduly harsh impact on certain customers.<footnotemark>47</footnotemark> And the Commission <em>has </em>granted special relief to several parties claiming harm as a result of discrimination in allocation. By refusing to impose such a new plan without a sufficient record, the Commission is not shirking its \u00a7 5 remedial duties. It has merely determined that the (known) effects of the existing plan may be less severe than those of a plan prescribed without adequate study.</p>\n<p id=\"b1089-13\">We now turn to Gardinier\u2019s claim that the Commission should have required the pipeline to shoulder its \u00a7 4<footnotemark>48</footnotemark> burden of <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"1016\">*1016</page-number>unilaterally filing a proposed curtailment system. In our discussion of \u00a7 5 remedial procedures, we explained one of our objections to this position. If FGT were persuasively to claim that it had filed only under coercion from the Commission, and \u00a7 5 procedures had not been observed, the filings would be invalid.</p>\n<p id=\"b1090-4\">If, on the other hand, FGT voluntarily filed, only <em>guided </em>by the 807 order, the \u00a7 4 mechanism would be set in motion. As we explained in <em>Southern Natural Gas Co., supra </em>at 832,</p>\n<blockquote id=\"b1090-5\">[ujnder section 4, a regulatee can file its own plan, and, after 30 days, that plan will take effect unless the FPC suspends its operation. In no event can the FPC suspend a proffered plan for longer than five months.</blockquote>\n<p id=\"b1090-6\">Courts have recognized that \u00a7 4 allows \u201cgreater celerity and flexibility,\u201d <em>Southern Natural Gas Co., supra </em>at 832, and for that reason have often deemed it appropriate to proceed thereunder in emergency situations. <em>FPC v. Louisiana Power and Light Co., supra. </em>But as we have observed, the authority to do so is discretionary. The Commission stated specifically its reasons for not wanting any plan to become effective before the completion of a hearing and Commission action. Since we have found its rationale reasonably adequate in our discussion of \u00a7 5, we find it unnecessary to review it further. We thus reject Gardinier\u2019s claim.</p>\n<p id=\"b1090-7\">\n<em>Transportation Gas</em>\n</p>\n<p id=\"b1090-8\">We finally turn to the contention of several of the petitioners<footnotemark>49</footnotemark> that the Commission should order curtailment of the FP and FPL-owned gas that FGT merely transports.<footnotemark>50</footnotemark> When considering this claim in the Fort Pierce proceeding, the Commission said</p>\n<blockquote id=\"b1090-15\">[w]e do not concur with Cities in curtailing the T-gas under any of the contracts because such gas is not owned by Florida Gas and does not form a part of the system\u2019s gas supply from which gas can be allocated to its various customers.</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b1090-16\">* # * sfc * *</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b1090-17\">Since legal title to the gas has vested in the two power companies prior to its interstate transportation, we do not believe that the <em>Louisiana Power and Light </em>and <em>Lo-Vaca Gathering Company </em>cases are applicable herein for purposes of Cities\u2019 request.</blockquote>\n<p id=\"b1090-18\">The Commission adopted this position in Opinion 807-A, in which it revoked joinder of FP and FPL and excluded transportation gas from the curtailment proceeding.</p>\n<p id=\"b1090-19\">Petitioners advance several arguments in support of their attack on the Commission\u2019s order. The first is that \u00a7 1<footnotemark>51</footnotemark> of the Act grants the Commission the jurisdiction to curtail any gas that is transported in interstate commerce, regardless of who owns it. As authority for this statement, it cites two Supreme Court opinions, <em>FPC v. Louisiana Power &amp; Light, supra, </em>and <em>California v. Lo-Vaca Gathering Co., </em>1965, 379 U.S. 366, 85 S.Ct. 486, 13 L.Ed.2d 357. We think both cases distinguishable.</p>\n<p id=\"b1090-20\">In <em>Louisiana Power &amp; Light </em>the Commission had imposed an interim curtailment plan to cover all sales customers of United Gas Pipe Line Company, both direct and resale. In rejecting the direct customers\u2019 objection that their sales were not jurisdictional and, therefore, could not be curtailed, <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"1017\">*1017</page-number>the Court said that \u201cthe Act applies to interstate \u2018transportation\u2019 regardless of whether the gas transported is ultimately sold retail or wholesale.\u201d 406 U.S. at 636, 92 S.Ct. at 1836.</p>\n<p id=\"b1091-5\">Petitioners would have us find that just as it was unnecessary in <em>Louisiana Power &amp; Light </em>to find direct sales jurisdictional for rate purposes, it is unnecessary to deal with the <em>ownership </em>of transportation gas. We cannot make the logical connection necessary to reach such a conclusion. The Supreme Court dealt only with the issue of whether the Commission could, independently of its sales jurisdiction, supervise curtailment of gas <em>owned </em>by a natural gas company.<footnotemark>52</footnotemark> It made this clear when it explained that</p>\n<blockquote id=\"b1091-6\">[ujnder LP&amp;L\u2019s argument, this volume would be wholly exempt from any curtailment plan approved by the FPC and thus United\u2019s resale customers would be forced to accept the entire burden of sharply reduced volumes while direct-sales customers received full contract service .</blockquote>\n<p id=\"b1091-7\"><em>Id. </em>at 632, 92 S.Ct. at 1834. We cannot extend the Court\u2019s holding to allow Commission-ordered allocation of gas owned by two companies that are not subject to Commission jurisdiction.</p>\n<p id=\"b1091-8\">Similarly, we do not agree with petitioners that <em>Lo-Vaca </em>provides a basis for including FGT\u2019s transportation gas within the Commission\u2019s jurisdiction. In that case El Paso Natural Gas Company purchased gas produced in Texas by Lo-Vaca and Houston Pipe Line Company. Pursuant to its various contracts with Lo-Vaca, El Paso bought gas both for resale (jurisdictional) and for its own use (non-jurisdictional). El Paso\u2019s contract with Houston restricted the gas to intrastate uses (non-jurisdictional). The Commission held that the commingling of the three supplies established FPC rate jurisdiction over the entire amount owned by El Paso.</p>\n<p id=\"b1091-14\">The Supreme Court affirmed the holding, but we think that it made clear that the particular facts of the situation dictated the result.<footnotemark>53</footnotemark> Expressing fear that a contrary holding would allow pipelines to discriminate between producers by \u201cimmuniz[ing] [some] from the reach of federal regulation,\u201d 379 U.S. at 370, 85 S.Ct. at 488, the Court found that \u201cthe fact that a substantial part of the gas will be resold, in our view, invokes federal jurisdiction over the entire transaction.\u201d <em>Id. </em>at 369, 85 S.Ct. at 488. The Court has never extended this holding beyond the facts of this case \u2014 petitioners have not convinced us that we should.</p>\n<p id=\"b1091-15\">Trying a slightly different tack, petitioners claim that the Commission has recognized its jurisdiction in at least two specific situations, in the <em>Sea Robin </em>proceedings<footnotemark>54</footnotemark> and in <em>Fort Pierce Utility Authority, supra. </em>We disagree. In <em>Fort Pierce </em>several of the petitioners before us today had applied for special relief from FGT\u2019s curtailment plan. They contended that transportation gas <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"1018\">*1018</page-number>should be curtailed to help relieve the burden on FGT\u2019s sales customers. The Commission found that a special relief proceeding was an inappropriate forum for consideration of the question. It neither admitted nor denied jurisdiction. It simply ruled that the parties would have to reassert their claim pursuant to \u00a7 1.6 of the Commission\u2019s Rules of Practice and Procedure, 18 CFR \u00a7 1.6 (1975).<footnotemark>55</footnotemark></p>\n<p id=\"b1092-4\">In <em>Sea Robin </em>the Commission granted certification for the transportation of new deliveries of offshore gas by Sea Robin Pipeline to Amoco for sale to FGT. It conditioned the certificate upon the requirement that \u201cthe gas involved shall be delivered to FGT only in satisfaction of the Amoco-FGT . . . sale and none . to [FPL].\u201d The Commission acted upon the authority expressly granted to it in \u00a7 7(e)<footnotemark>56</footnotemark> of the Act to \u201clay down conditions precedent to the entry of natural gas into interstate commerce.\u201d It did not purport to assert curtailment authority over transportation gas. It did not force the pipeline to reallocate gas it did not own \u2014 Sea Robin would still deliver all the gas to Amoco, a natural gas company, over which the Commission has jurisdiction. The situation is clearly distinguishable from that presented here.</p>\n<p id=\"b1092-12\">A recent case from the District of Columbia Circuit, <em>American Public Gas Association (APGA) v. FERC, </em>1978, 190 U.S.App.D.C. 192, 587 F.2d 1089, lends support to the result we reach today.<footnotemark>57</footnotemark> In rejecting a claim that certain transportation gas had to be included in pipeline curtailment plans, the Court said that</p>\n<blockquote id=\"b1092-13\">the purpose of a curtailment plan is to prescribe the manner in which a pipeline that cannot meet its contractual commitments will curtail deliveries of its <em>own </em>gas.</blockquote>\n<p id=\"b1092-14\">190 U.S.App.D.C. at 201, 587 F.2d at 1098.</p>\n<p id=\"b1092-15\">The excerpt from <em>APGA </em>describes the situation before us. FGT stands in the <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"1019\">*1019</page-number>position of a bailee in relation to FP and FPL. We think that the Commission correctly determined that because FGT never owned the gas, it could not be compelled to allocate it to others. The transportation gas has never been a part of the supply available to FGT for satisfaction of its sales contracts. We see no authority for making it so now.</p>\n<p id=\"b1093-5\">Having determined that the Commission correctly found that it had no jurisdiction over the transportation gas, we find it unnecessary to address fully petitioners\u2019 other arguments. We merely point out that the Commission\u2019s legal conclusion did not constitute a factual determination that the curtailment of transportation gas would not result in greater availability to some higher-priority users. Neither did it implicitly approve undue discrimination in allocation of supplies. Finding that the Commission acted reasonably, we affirm.<footnotemark>58</footnotemark></p>\n<p id=\"b1093-6\">ENFORCED.</p>\n<footnote label=\"1\">\n<p id=\"b1080-5\">.

FGT began its pipeline operations pursuant to Commission authorization issued December 29, 1956. At that time, the Commission recognized that because of Florida\u2019s mild weather and relatively low level of industrial development, small load requirements would make it difficult for the pipeline to operate efficiently. It therefore certificated the pipeline\u2019s transportation of large quantities of gas purchased by FP and FPL for ultimate use as boiler fuel in generating electricity. (FP had contracted with Sun Oil Company and Pure Oil Company to purchase gas from Southern Louisiana reserves. FPL had contracted with Sun to purchase gas from South Texas fields. Both power companies had contracted with FGT to transport this gas).</p>\n</footnote>\n<footnote label=\"4\">\n<p id=\"b1080-16\">. FGT transports this gas under transportation rate schedules T-l, T-2, and T-3.</p>\n</footnote>\n<footnote label=\"5\">\n<p id=\"b1080-17\">. Only customers that also buy schedule G gas may buy schedule I gas. Schedule I gas costs less than gas sold to direct industrial customers.</p>\n</footnote>\n<footnote label=\"6\">\n<p id=\"b1081-6\">. There are two classes of interruptible service: primary and preferred. During the years 1962 through 1971, FGT served another class of customers \u2014 intermediate interruptible. According to petitioners\u2019 brief on the undue discrimination issue, there have been no customers in this class since 1971.</p>\n<p id=\"b1081-7\">In 1962 FGT adopted a policy of making industrial sales through distribution companies whenever possible. If a potential customer were located in an area served by one of FGT\u2019s wholesale customers, it would refer the new company to the distributor. If not, FGT would sell directly. Thus, geographical location of the industrial customers determined whether they would buy directly or indirectly.</p>\n</footnote>\n<footnote label=\"7\">\n<p id=\"b1081-8\">. More specifically, FGT offers three broad classes of service:</p>\n<blockquote id=\"b1081-9\">a. Transportation for Florida Power and FPL of gas purchased by the utilities in the field.</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b1081-10\">b. Wholesales to local distributors for resale. These fall into two categories:</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b1081-11\">Firm service \u2014 under rate schedule G. This resale firm service is basically to residential and small commercial users. (R. 1688-90, 537).</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b1081-12\">Interruptible service \u2014 under rate schedule I.

Most pipeline customers are distributor companies which resell the gas to ultimate consumers; therefore, under the end-use approach, the extent to which a pipeline\u2019s distributor customers are curtailed depends on the \u201cmix\u201d of each distributor\u2019s own customers. Distributors who have a large percentage of high priority customers theoretically will not be curtailed as deeply as those who have a small percentage of such customers, and distributors who have a large percentage of low priority customers will be curtailed more sharply than those who have a small percentage of such customers. The object of an \u201cend-use\u201d plan is to ensure that higher priority uses are completely supplied before lower priority uses are served.</blockquote>\n<p id=\"b1082-8\">In Order No. 467, 49 FPC 85 (1973), as modified by Order No. 467-B, 49 FPC 583 (1973), the Commission announced a policy of favoring curtailment priorities based on the purposes for which the gas would be used. These orders will be referred to collectively as Order No. 467 unless otherwise necessary for clarity.</p>\n</footnote>\n<footnote label=\"14\">\n<p id=\"b1082-12\">. In connection with this order, the Commission determined that a hearing should be held on a new curtailment plan. The ALJ had phased the evidentiary hearing so that if he determined in Phase I that the existing plan were unduly discriminatory, he would hear evidence on a new plan in Phase II. Because of his initial determination, the record contained no evidence on a new plan.</p>\n</footnote>\n<footnote label=\"15\">\n<p id=\"b1082-13\">.

Before addressing the issues, we wish to point out that we find each reviewable. At our prehearing conference, held March 3, 1978, <em>see </em>note 2, <em>supra, </em>we requested that the parties argue in their briefs the question whether each issue is reviewable. They ably complied with our request, thus aiding us in reaching the conclusion that each is ripe for review. Regarding each question, the Commission has rendered a determination sufficiently final and definitive to invoke this Court\u2019s jurisdiction. <em>See Port of Boston Marine Terminal Ass\u2019n v.

Petitioners attempt to highlight this alleged arbitrariness by citing the Commission\u2019s \u201cOrder Granting Motion to Dismiss Complaint and Request for Order to Show Cause and Permitting Interventions,\u201d issued May 12, 1977, in <em>General Motors Corp. v. Natural Gas Pipeline Co. of America, </em>Docket No. RP76-86 (\u201cOrder No. 467 . . . was not intended to initiate a proceeding or to provide a binding rule without further proceedings directed toward curtailment problems of specific pipelines.\u201d) Opinions 807 and 807-A, they argue, are clearly inconsistent with <em>General Motors.</em></p>\n<p id=\"b1083-17\">FERC, however, distinguishes <em>General Motors </em>on the ground that the issue of undue discrimination had not been raised in those proceedings. The Commission dismissed the complaint primarily because \u201cGeneral Motors\u2019 complaint failjed] to disclose the presence of any direct, immediate injury that General Motors can sustain from the continuance of Natural\u2019s currently effective curtailment program.\u201d</p>\n</footnote>\n<footnote label=\"24\">\n<p id=\"b1083-18\">. We recognize that much of the Commission\u2019s language, especially in opinion 807, reflects the Commission\u2019s preference for an end-use plan. We think, however, that one statement clarifies FERC\u2019s approach:</p>\n<blockquote id=\"b1083-19\">In the opinion of the Commission it is not necessary to show higher overall costs of doing business or a competitive disadvantage in order to prove undue discrimination or preference in favor of others. The essence of the principle is that those who are similarly entitled must be treated equally regardless of their ability to survive otherwise.</blockquote>\n<p id=\"b1083-20\">Thus it appears that the Commission deems \u00a7 4(b) to be calling for equal treatment of those who use gas (or who are entitled to it) in similar ways. It is enforcing its interpretation of the statutory standard, and we cannot say that its interpretation is unreasonable. Order 467 merely represents the Commission\u2019s view of a way to enforce that standard.</p>\n</footnote>\n<footnote label=\"25\">\n<p id=\"b1084-6\">. This Court has recognized that end-use priorities constitute a \u201cmost appropriate consideration for purposes of a curtailment plan.\u201d <em>Louisiana v. FPC, </em>5 Cir., 1974, 503 F.2d 844, 858.</p>\n</footnote>\n<footnote label=\"26\">\n<p id=\"b1084-7\">. Op. 807, slip op. at 7-9.</p>\n</footnote>\n<footnote label=\"27\">\n<p id=\"b1084-8\">.

While admitting that the plan <em>does </em>discriminate, petitioners correctly point out that more is required to violate the Act. Section 4(b) prohibits <em>undue </em>discrimination, preference without a reasonable basis:</p>\n<blockquote id=\"b1084-10\">(b) No natural-gas company shall, with respect to any transportation or sale of natural gas subject to the jurisdiction of the Commission, (1) make or grant any undue preference or advantage to any person or subject any person to any undue prejudice or disadvantage, or (2) maintain any unreasonable difference in rates, charges, service, facilities, or in any other respect, either as between localities or as between classes of service.</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b1084-11\">15 U.S.C.A. \u00a7 717c(b).</blockquote>\n</footnote>\n<footnote label=\"29\">\n<p id=\"b1084-16\">. According to petitioners, FGT has worked to further this policy by its practice of encouraging industrial sales through wholesale distributors. If they experience curtailments of supply, these distributors will then pass on the curtailments to their resale industrial customers before their resale residential customers. In the meantime, FGT\u2019s direct industrial customers, by suffering the greatest curtailments, support the establishment of the resale markets. Theoretically, then, as resale markets grow, direct markets will be curtailed out of existence. (The Commission denies that phase out was ever a purpose of the plan. It instead contends that FGT intended to serve <em>all </em>loads, direct and indirect).</p>\n<p id=\"b1084-17\">Petitioners argue that the direct customers, by paying a lower price for their gas, bargained for this greater degree of curtailment. We, however, agree with the Commission\u2019s observation, in Opinion 807, that</p>\n<blockquote id=\"AN4\">[ejven if the direct sales customers could be found to have entered into contracts with <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"1011\">*1011</page-number>FGT directly in order to obtain certain advantages such as a lower price for gas or the option to use oil, which was then less expensive than gas, circumstances changed radically and what may once have been a non-discriminatory contract would have become a discriminatory one.</blockquote>\n<p id=\"b1085-6\">At the time the direct customers negotiated their contracts, they <em>and </em>FGT contemplated only short curtailments, mostly related to pipeline capacity. As the demand for gas grew, the pipeline would periodically expand capacity. In the context of a severe gas shortage and the resultant need rationally to allocate a disappearing commodity, the parties (and the Commission) must consider different factors than they would in allocating the inconvenience that accompanies periodic expansion of facilities. <em>See Consolidated Edison Co. v. FPC, </em>1975, 168 U.S.App.D.C. 92, 102, 512 F.2d 1332, 1342 (\u201cThe shortage itself appears to have come with a suddenness and severity which the agency failed to anticipate. With it, came the recognition that in the absence of some guidance from the Commission, the allocation of scarce supplies might be too much governed by concentrated economic interests rather than the public interest generally.\u201d) <em>See also American Smelting &amp; Refining Co. v. FPC, </em>1974, 161 U.S.App.D.C. 6, 15, 494 F.2d 925, 934, <em>cert. denied, </em>419 U.S. 882, 95 S.Ct. 148, 42 L.Ed.2d 122, in which the court observed that</p>\n<blockquote id=\"A3rm\">[t]he short answer to this argument [that a Commission-imposed curtailment system disrupts contractual relations of the parties] is that the Commission is not bound by agreements among parties subject to its jurisdiction.

We must again emphasize that the Commission did <em>not </em>make its finding of undue discrimination on the ground that FGT did not employ an end-use plan. It instead found that an end-use plan would remedy the unjustified discrimination.</p>\n</footnote>\n<footnote label=\"31\">\n<p id=\"b1085-10\">. Petitioners argue that the Commission recognized the reasonableness of the existing plan in Opinion No. 611, in which it rejected the City of Gainesville\u2019s (a direct industrial user) claim that \u201cthe same priority of service should be assigned to both resale I gas and the direct sale preferred interruptible gas.\u201d Florida Gas Transmission Co., Opin. No. 611, 47 FPC 341, 380 (1972). (The Commission denied rehearing of Opinion 611, by order issued January 19, 1973, after having issued Order 467).</p>\n<p id=\"b1085-11\">The Commission distinguishes Opinion 611 by pointing out that Gainesville had presented its discrimination claim in terms of a rate differential rather than a disparity of curtailment. It had complained that because it had to pay more than the price of schedule I gas, it should enjoy curtailment priority at least equal with that of the resale industrials. The Commission, however, explained that</p>\n<blockquote id=\"ANr\">[t]he I service is different from the direct preferred interruptible service. To qualify for it the distributor must purchase higher priced G service whereas the direct interruptible customers need not do so. Furthermore, the I rate has been held low to make it competitive with other fuels * * *. We conclude, therefore, that the tariff should not be changed with respect to priorities on curtailment <em>at this time.</em></blockquote>\n<p id=\"b1085-12\">(emphasis added).</p>\n<p id=\"b1085-13\">Moreover, as of the date of Opinion 611, Gainesville had experienced almost no curtailment of gas supplies. Cf. note 10, <em>supra.</em></p>\n</footnote>\n<footnote label=\"32\">\n<p id=\"b1085-14\">. We find nothing in the record that indicates (as petitioners appear to imply) that residential consumers will no longer receive gas if resale <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"1012\">*1012</page-number>industrials begin to experience curtailments on an equal basis with direct industrials. And absent some evidence that the present plan actually <em>does </em>provide greater protection to high-priority users, discrimination based on that premise cannot be justified. <em>See North Carolina v. FERC, supra, </em>190 U.S.App.D.C. at 31, 584 F.2d at 1012.</p>\n<p id=\"b1086-7\">We also think that the thrust of the petitioners\u2019 argument aims at the unknown but impending future curtailment system rather than at the Commission\u2019s basic finding. In asserting their position, they have forgotten that the Commission must consider the impact that a plan actually does or will have on ultimate consumers. At this point the Commission has merely found that \u201ceconomic factors have a diverse impact on [FGT\u2019s] customers, and [petitioners] offer no justification for disparate treatment of direct and indirect customers.\u201d It will next supervise implementation of a new plan that allocates the gas in the most efficient way possible but without arbitrary distinctions within a class of customers. <em>See id., </em>190 U.S. App.D.C. at 31, 33-35, 584 F.2d at 1012, 1014-16.</p>\n</footnote>\n<footnote label=\"33\">\n<p id=\"b1086-13\">.

It did not purport to expound the principle that property rights will in all cases be inferior to FERC authority.</p>\n<p id=\"b1092-18\">The case before us does not involve abandonment.
