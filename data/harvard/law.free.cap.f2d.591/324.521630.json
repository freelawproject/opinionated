Watts against the Tuscaloosa County, Alabama, Board of Education (Board). NEA contends that the Board\u2019s 1971 dismissal of Mrs. Watts from her position as an elementary school teacher violated the mandate of <em>Singleton v. Jackson Municipal Separate School District, </em>5 Cir., 1970, 419 F.2d 1211 (en banc). This assertion is meritless and we therefore affirm the district court\u2019s order.</p>\n<p id=\"b399-18\">Mrs. Watts, a black, worked for 25 years as an elementary school teacher in the Tuscaloosa County system, spending 24 years employed in all-black schools. After the United States District Court for the Northern District of Alabama placed the Tuscaloosa County system under a terminal desegregation order on February 4, 1970, Mrs. Watts was transferred to the predominantly white Cottondale Elementary School, where she experienced severe difficulties in maintaining classroom discipline. According to testimony before the district court, on numerous occasions Mrs. Watts\u2019 superiors observed her class and discussed with her possible solutions to the discipline problem, without success. The Board suspended Mrs. Watts on February 2, 1971, replacing her with a white teacher hired later that month. At Mrs. Watts\u2019 request, on March 2 the Board conducted a public hearing with respect to her status; though afforded the opportunity, she neither called witnesses in her own behalf nor cross-examined those who testified regarding her alleged lack of teaching competence. Following this hearing, the Board determined that Mrs. Watts was incompetent as a teacher and terminated her employment. She appealed to the Alabama State Tenure Commission which, after another hearing on March 31, 1971, upheld the Board\u2019s decision.</p>\n<p id=\"b399-19\">On June 17, 1971, NEA filed on behalf of Mrs. Watts in district court a motion for <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"326\">*326</page-number>further relief, claiming that the Board dismissed her solely because of race and not on the basis of nonracial objective standards, as required by our decision in <em>Singleton </em>and the Tuscaloosa terminal desegregation order, and seeking reinstatement, a new contract with full tenure rights, normal salary increases and retirement benefits, backpay and damages. NEA filed a motion for special setting on July 27, 1977, requesting disposition of the 1971 claim. After trying the case on January 10 and 12, 1978, the district court held <em>Singleton </em>inapplicable and concluded that there was substantial evidence supporting the Board\u2019s finding that Mrs. Watts \u201cwas fired because of her incompetence as a teacher and not on account of racial considerations.\u201d</p>\n<p id=\"b400-4\">Under our <em>Singleton </em>decision, any teacher \u201cdismissed or demoted\u201d as part of an overall reduction in staff resulting from court-ordered conversion to a unitary school system must be selected on the \u201cbasis of objective and reasonable nondiscriminatory standards.\u201d 419 F.2d 1218. However, \u201cthis Court did not intend that the strict requirements of <em>Singleton </em>apply in the absence of desegregation related reductions.\u201d <em>Pickens v. Okolona Municipal Separate School District, </em>5 Cir., 1976, 527 F.2d 358, 361. As the district court found, no such \u201cdesegregation related reductions\u201d occurred in the Tuscaloosa County system \u201ceither immediately before or after\u201d Mrs. Watts\u2019 firing. Accordingly, <em>Singleton </em>is inapplicable and given our reluctance \u201c[f]or sound policy reasons ... to intrude upon the internal affairs of local school authorities in such matters as teacher competency,\u201d our inquiry here is limited to whether \u201csubstantial evidence supports the school board\u2019s finding of incompetency.\u201d <em>Blunt v. Marion County School Board, </em>5 Cir., 1975, 515 F.2d 951, 956.</p>\n<p id=\"b400-5\">The Board presented testimony from three of Mrs. Watts\u2019 superiors detailing the drastic breakdown of discipline in her classroom and their repeated unsuccessful attempts to help her solve the problem. In light of this testimony, we agree with the trial judge that there was substantial evidence to support the Board\u2019s finding of incompetence and therefore affirm the district court\u2019s order.</p>\n<p id=\"b400-7\">AFFIRMED.</p>\n</opinion>\n</casebody>\n",
