Upon consideration thereof, since the court agrees with the trial judge\u2019s recommended decision, as hereinafter set forth,<footnotemark>*</footnotemark> it hereby affirms and adopts the said decision as the basis for its judgment in this case. Accordingly, the court concludes and specifically finds that defendant\u2019s special plea in fraud is sustained and plaintiff\u2019s claim is adjudged forfeited to the United States pursuant to 28 U.S.C. \u00a7 2514. The petition is dismissed and judgment of forfeiture is entered on defendant\u2019s second counterclaim.</p>\n<p id=\"b741-22\">OPINION OF TRIAL JUDGE</p>\n<author id=\"b741-23\">SCHWARTZ, Trial Judge:</author>\n<p id=\"b741-24\">In this suit for redetermination of profits under the Renegotiation Act of 1951, 50 U.S.C.App. \u00a7 1211 <em>et seq., </em>as amended, the plaintiff maintains, as is customary, that its profits for the year under review were not excessive. The suit differs from most such suits, however, in that the primary issue concerns the honesty of the records present<page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"668\">*668</page-number>ed by the plaintiff, on the pretrial and trial of the case, as proof of its profits.</p>\n<p id=\"b742-4\">The Government\u2019s main defense is a contention that plaintiff\u2019s proof as to its costs and profits, in its books and records and in its income tax return for the year under review, is false and fraudulent, and it having been knowingly presented in the attempted proof of the claim, the claim should be forfeited under 28 U.S.C. \u00a7 2514 (1970).<footnotemark>1</footnotemark> The defense is upheld, and the claim is forfeited. On the facts found in reaching the judgment of forfeiture, it is alternatively held that plaintiff has failed to make the prima facie case as to its costs and profits, required of it under <em>Lykes Bros. S.S. Co. </em>v. <em>United States, </em>459 F.2d 1393, 1401, 198 Ct.Cl. 312, 326-27 (1972). In the event of a judgment of forfeiture, the Government has waived its counterclaim alleging excessive profits to an amount greater than determined by the Renegotiation Board. The waiver makes it unnecessary to consider the degree to which the production by the plaintiff of defective war material, shown by the record, constituted such an affirmative harm to the war effort as would affect the excessiveness of plaintiff\u2019s profits in the year under review, within the meaning and policy of the Renegotiation Act.</p>\n<p id=\"b742-5\">The plaintiff corporation, located in Highland Park, Illinois, is a manufacturer and supplier of gears and machine parts, most of which are sold to the Government for varied military uses. Raw materials, usually metals and alloys available in the commercial market, are obtained from a few regular suppliers, cut and machined in plaintiff\u2019s own shop as necessary, and then packaged for shipment. Special heat processing, where called for, is done by an outside plant.</p>\n<p id=\"b742-6\">Substantially all of the stock in plaintiff is owned by George C. O\u2019Brien, plaintiff\u2019s founder and president, who supervises operations in the machine shop and does all the bidding. Company personnel consists of a controller; a treasurer, who was Mr. O\u2019Brien\u2019s elderly mother; an office manager; a few clerical employees; and an average of 40 production employees. In plaintiff\u2019s fiscal year ending September 30,1967, the year under review, plaintiff reported total sales of $1,966,845, of which $1,745,389 or 89 percent was renegotiable. Reported profits on the renegotiable sales were $203,-534, a rate of 11.7 percent. Renegotiable profits as reconstructed in the findings of fact made after trial, to the extent plaintiff\u2019s books permitted reconstruction, were $363,770.</p>\n<p id=\"b742-13\">The plaintiff had in 1970 been convicted in the U. S. District Court for the Northern District of Illinois on a number of counts of conspiracy with its president, Mr. O\u2019Brien and with unnamed others to violate 18 U.S.C. \u00a7\u00a7 286 and 287 in connection with Government contracts and other matters. The conspirators had between 1965 and 1968, among other things, submitted false claims against the United States in violation of 18 U.S.C. \u00a7\u00a7 286 and 287 for payment of goods delivered under contracts for use in ships, airplanes, gun mounts and radar installations, with knowledge that the goods did not conform to the specifications and were inferior to those required; had willfully possessed and made false certificates of the testing of such goods; and in violation of 18 U.S.C. \u00a7 1503 had obstructed justice by removing from the plaintiff\u2019s files and willfully refusing to produce documents as commanded by a grand jury subpoena duces tecum.</p>\n<p id=\"b742-14\">Plaintiff\u2019s office manager and corporate secretary during the relevant period was one Julian M. Davis, who was employed throughout 1967 and until February 1968. His duties included supervision of accounts receivable and bank accounts. Davis was indicted with the plaintiff but was not tried.</p>\n<p id=\"b743-4\"><page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"669\">*669</page-number>On the trial of the present case, Davis testified that during 1967 Howard Williams, plaintiff\u2019s controller, using charcoal pencil, made out a number of checks to cash, and that he, Davis, cashed them, endorsing them in similar pencil. Davis would then either hand the cash to O\u2019Brien or put it in his desk drawer. On the return of the check by the bank, following its payment, Williams would erase the pencilled name of the endorser and the word \u201ccash,\u201d type in as payee the name of one of plaintiff\u2019s supplier companies, and stamp an endorsement in the name of that supplier, using a counterfeit rubber stamp. Corresponding entries would then be made in plaintiff\u2019s check register. Davis testified that the bogus stamps had been procured by Williams, using as models the rubber stamp on other, legitimate checks. Williams had prepared many such endorsement stamps but the only one that the witness could remember specifically was that for the Central Steel &amp; Wire Company.</p>\n<p id=\"b743-5\">To substantiate these pretended payments, Davis continued, Williams caused to be printed a number of invoices in the names of plaintiff\u2019s suppliers, the pretended payees. Williams would type up such blank invoices to match the amount of the check, to give the appearance of actual purchases corresponding to the amount of the checks.</p>\n<p id=\"b743-6\">Davis testified that O\u2019Brien, the plaintiff\u2019s president, procured a number of blank forms for the test certificates required by the \u201cfast pay\u201d procedure used in small purchases by the Defense Supply Agency, one of plaintiff\u2019s two Government customers. These O\u2019Brien delivered to Davis to put in the company\u2019s vault. Certificates were filled out by Davis in the name of three or four of plaintiff\u2019s suppliers, one of them Central Steel &amp; Wire Company. Davis would prepare the certificate, using information from the plaintiff\u2019s purchasing records, to give the false appearance that the supplier companies had actually tested the items.</p>\n<p id=\"b743-7\">In the time between the making and delivery of the bid and the award of a Government contract, Davis further testified, he modified bids to change their amount. These modifications were connected with what O\u2019Brien called \u201cpay offs\u201d to Government buyers at the Electronics Supply Office of the Navy at Great Lakes, Illinois, the other of plaintiff\u2019s two Government customers. O\u2019Brien would ask him to compute the difference between the original and the altered bid amounts, in order to determine the \u201ccommission\u201d to these buyers.</p>\n<p id=\"b743-9\">Finally, Davis testified that sometime late in 1966 he was given a check for $10,-000, ostensibly as a bonus, but that the auditing firm in charge of plaintiff\u2019s books directed him to cash the check, to declare the $10,000 as income and pay the tax thereon \u2014 about $2,500 \u2014 and to return the remainder to O\u2019Brien. Plaintiff then recorded the $10,000 payment on its books as a bonus and declared it as an expense in its income tax return for either its fiscal year 1966 or 1967. Plaintiff\u2019s tax returns for both these years were introduced by it into evidence.</p>\n<p id=\"b743-10\">Davis\u2019 testimony was substantially a repetition of a statement he made to the authorities shortly after his indictment. His testimony on trial was given with every appearance of truth and is found to be credible and reliable.</p>\n<p id=\"b743-11\">The state of plaintiff\u2019s books and records was testified to by Mr. Ronald Cooper, an accountant with the FBI, in charge of the examination of the books and records submitted by plaintiff, in the pretrial of the present proceeding, for audit by the defendant. He testified to the confusion in plaintiff\u2019s books, which included unsupported entries, inconsistencies between tax forms and record entries and between checks and check registers. Numerous items in plaintiff\u2019s cash and bank accounts had no supporting documentation and lacked any indication of source, destination or vehicle of disbursement. In his opinion, plaintiff\u2019s books were not kept in accordance with generally accepted accounting principles. Mr. Cooper testified to the following specific matters.</p>\n<p id=\"b744-3\"><page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"670\">*670</page-number>He examined the check register for plaintiff\u2019s fiscal year 1967, with particular reference to an earlier Internal Revenue Service disallowance of $144,234 claimed on plaintiff\u2019s return for 1967 as a deduction on account of cost of goods sold. The $144,234 represented the sum of 31 checks described in plaintiff\u2019s check register as payments to suppliers. The cancelled checks themselves were missing from plaintiff\u2019s records, but a few of them were traced from bank microfilm records. The microfilms showed these checks to have been made out to cash and endorsed by Julian Davis, and were presumably actually treated in the manner described by the witness Davis.</p>\n<p id=\"b744-4\">Six amounts to a total of $59,000 were in 1967 posted in plaintiff\u2019s ledger to research and development, shown in the check register to have been made out to suppliers and in fact, as the bank microfilms showed, were made out to cash and cashed over the counter at the plaintiff\u2019s bank. These checks are presumed to have been part of the 31 checks for $144,234 discussed above. Plaintiff\u2019s general ledger for 1967 contained no postings of year-end closing adjusting entries to account for the remainder of the $144,234 in missing checks. Mr. Cooper concluded that the claimed deduction of $144,234 was not a proper business expense, since it was unsupported by any documentation other than a general attribution in part to \u201cresearch and development,\u201d and consisted at least in part of checks actually made out to \u201ccash.\u201d It appears that the $144,234 was a false deduction from income.</p>\n<p id=\"b744-5\">Mr. Cooper examined not only plaintiff\u2019s records for 1967 but also plaintiff\u2019s general ledger from 1964 to 1968, a general journal from 1959 to 1968, and records of cash disbursements, cash receipts and sales between 1962 and 1968. Plaintiff\u2019s profits for years other than 1967 are not directly in question in this suit. These records, however, were submitted for review by plaintiff in the pretrial of this case and they are relevant if not on the plea of attempted fraud in proof of 1967 profits then in the evaluation of the trustworthiness and thus the probative value of plaintiff\u2019s records in general.</p>\n<p id=\"b744-6\">With minor exceptions, no supporting documentation was provided for the entries contained in these books. The only available trial balance papers, which normally contain closing adjusting entries, related to the fiscal year 1966.</p>\n<p id=\"b744-7\">A $150,000 deduction from income in 1968 comprised four separate entries purporting to be cash disbursements by check. The checks themselves were missing. In plaintiff\u2019s bank statements, Mr. Cooper found references to 24 checks, to a total of $150,-000, which were not recorded in plaintiff\u2019s books. Although there was a posting reference to the checks, there was no corresponding listing in the general ledger, general journal or records of receipts and sales. Again, microfilms of the actual checks as they cleared the bank showed that they had been signed by Mr. O\u2019Brien, made out to \u201ccash,\u201d and were negotiated either by Mr. O\u2019Brien or by plaintiff\u2019s controller, Howard Williams. The net result was that the $150,000 was not an expense but rather income not disclosed in the tax return for 1968.</p>\n<p id=\"b744-8\">Asked about the checks with replaced payees and endorsements and the other accounting discrepancies in plaintiff\u2019s books, Mr. O\u2019Brien denied all knowledge of financial transactions. He specifically denied any knowledge of the checks making up the $150,000 disbursement and deduction in 1968. He could not remember having ever seen such checks. Presented with the checks, he acknowledged that his signature appeared as maker and endorser. He knew nothing of the income tax returns; they had been prepared, he said, by Howard Williams, the company\u2019s controller, who took care of the books and conducted all the company\u2019s financial affairs and he had signed them as plaintiff\u2019s president. Though he owned 96 percent of the stock in plaintiff, he denied control over his own salary as president. That salary, he said, was set by the controller, \u201cwhoever he was,\u201d that is, Williams.</p>\n<p id=\"b744-9\">Further, Mr. O\u2019Brien denied having anything to do with the forged test certificates <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"671\">*671</page-number>which Davis had testified were procured by O\u2019Brien. One of the acts in furtherance of the conspiracy between plaintiff and Mr. O\u2019Brien to violate 18 U.S.C. \u00a7 286 was that in 1965, he, O\u2019Brien, had placed an order with a printing firm in Evanston, Illinois, for 5,000 copies of a certificate of test form of the Central Steel &amp; Wire Company. Another was that on August 18, 1967, in the year under review in violation of 18 U.S.C. \u00a7 1002, he knowingly and with intent to defraud the United States had possession of 3,000 false, forged and counterfeited Certificate of Test forms purporting to be forms of Central Steel &amp; Wire Company, with the signature \u201cJ. Adams\u201d appearing thereon. O\u2019Brien was the sole witness for the plaintiff.</p>\n<p id=\"b745-5\">In pursuance of the Government\u2019s investigations of the plaintiff, the Defense Industrial Supply Center of the Defense Supply Agency at Philadelphia, the other of the plaintiff\u2019s two major Government customers, organized a task force led by a quality assurance specialist to make tests on the goods supplied by plaintiff, to the extent they were still in stock and could be located, under 180 randomly selected contracts. Items not in conformity with specifications were found to have been supplied in 109 of these contracts; 37 of the 109 had been awarded and entirely performed in 1967; 34 had been awarded prior to the year under review and partly performed in 1967.</p>\n<p id=\"b745-6\">The nature of the nonconformities varied. Where specifications called for one metal, another metal was used; alloys were used which were inferior to those required. Electrical rings supposed to be made of silver were in fact made of plated copper; cold rolled steel was used instead of stainless steel. Where a part was to be made of aluminum, a plastic was used. Where a hard chrome finish was required, it was not supplied. Where heat treatment was specified, it was omitted. Where tolerances or dimensions or qualities were specified, the actual tolerances were unacceptably different. For instance, studs required to have a tensile strength of 125,000 psi in fact had a tensile strength of 65,000 psi. At least 14 counts of the conviction of plaintiff in 1970 concern such deliveries under contracts performed by plaintiff in the fiscal year 1967. The goods themselves had been destroyed, but the conviction and the abundant expert testimony on the deficiencies in the goods are convincing evidence.</p>\n<p id=\"b745-8\">Most of the contracts with the Center were for small amounts, for under $2,500 (and, plaintiff points out, their total amounted to only about 4 percent of plaintiff\u2019s renegotiable sales). The items sold would go directly to military-user facilities which have no facilities for testing for compliance with the specifications. Such contracts provided for a \u201cfast payment\u201d procedure under which the supplier received payment promptly upon submission of an invoice containing a certification that the supplies shipped were as specified in the purchase order. O\u2019Brien had signed certificates of compliance with specifications in virtually all of the 71 contracts found to be noncomplying during 1967. The Government, not planning to make further tests, of course relied upon these certifications, and upon the supporting certificates of testing.</p>\n<p id=\"b745-9\">I</p>\n<p id=\"b745-10\">The Question of Forfeiture of the Claim Under 28 U.S.C. \u00a7 2514</p>\n<p id=\"b745-11\">The Government\u2019s first defense is that the claim is forfeit under 28 U.S.C. \u00a7 2514, which provides for the forfeiture of a \u201cclaim against the United States\u201d for \u201cany fraud against the United States in the proof, statement, establishment, or allowance thereof.\u201d Note 1, <em>supra. </em>The plaintiff\u2019s response is a denial of fraud, with apparent reliance on Mr. O\u2019Brien\u2019s denials, and a contention that plaintiff\u2019s petition for redetermination of. the excessiveness of its profits is under section 108 of the Renegotiation Act, 50 U.S.C.App. \u00a7 1218, and the decision of this court in <em>Lykes Bros. S.S. Co. v. United States, supra, </em>not a claim against the United States but rather a claim by the Government for the amount of the alleged excessive profits.</p>\n<p id=\"b746-3\"><page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"672\">*672</page-number>A. The Fraud</p>\n<p id=\"b746-4\">The first question \u2014 as to the facts of fraud in the sense of section 2514 \u2014 is readily disposed of. The fraud is only too plain.</p>\n<p id=\"b746-5\">The former conviction is by collateral estoppel binding on the plaintiff in this court. <em>Commissioner v. Sunnen, </em>333 U.S. 591, 597-98, 68 S.Ct. 715, 92 L.Ed. 898 (1948); <em>Armstrong v. United States, </em>354 F.2d 274, 289-91, 173 Ct.Cl. 944, 968-72 (1965); <em>Hercules Powder Co. v. United States, </em>337 F.2d 643, 644, 167 Ct.Cl. 639, 641-42 (1964); <em>cf. Kowal v. United States, </em>412 F.2d 867, 870, 188 Ct.Cl. 631, 636-67 (1969). The totality of the evidence, of which the former conviction is only a part, shows abundantly that false and fraudulent entries were made and entered in books and records of the plaintiff which were submitted by plaintiff for examination in the pretrial of this case, and in its income tax returns and its submissions to the Renegotiation Board, introduced by plaintiff in evidence on the trial of this case. The checks on which payees\u2019 and endorser\u2019s names were erased and forged are clear and convincing evidence of false entries of costs, as part of a continuing plan to understate the profits of the corporation, to the personal profit of plaintiff\u2019s president O\u2019Brien and perhaps others.</p>\n<p id=\"b746-6\">The frauds explicitly proven, moreover, are not necessarily all those that occurred, for plaintiff was convicted of withholding papers in its records, in disobedience to a subpoena.</p>\n<p id=\"b746-7\">The object of the frauds was to deceive the Internal Revenue Service as to the amount of plaintiff\u2019s taxable income and to deceive the Renegotiation Board as to the reasonableness of plaintiff\u2019s profits. When these records, shot through with fraud, were presented by plaintiff in support of its case in this court, a further, specific object was added \u2014 the proof by fraud of the claim here made. The fraud practiced here was an attempt by false and fraudulent records to prove that plaintiff\u2019s profits were lower than they actually were, and thereby to obtain a favorable determination that plaintiff\u2019s profits were reasonable and not excessive.</p>\n<p id=\"b746-8\">Mr. O\u2019Brien\u2019s testimony, denying all knowledge or responsibility, is rejected as in itself unconvincing and in the face of the contrary evidence incredible. The testimony was self-contradictory, impeached on cross-examination, and overwhelmed by the credible written evidence and witnesses for the Government, which assumed and met the burden of proof on the issue. Mr. O\u2019Brien\u2019s demeanor on the stand and his testimony, delivered in a listless monotone, are indescribable except to say that they engendered total disbelief. He is held to have organized and directed the original fraud and the effort here to prove the case by fraudulent documents. By his false denials on the stand he sought to further the proof by fraud. His fraud, that of the plaintiff\u2019s president, chief executive officer and substantially the sole owner of the corporate stock, is of course imputed to the plaintiff corporation. <em>Wagner Iron Works v. United States, </em>174 F.Supp. 956, 958, 146 Ct.Cl. 334, 338 (1959).</p>\n<p id=\"b746-9\">The evidence is thus clear and convincing, as required for a forfeiture under section 2514, that fraud was practiced, and that it was corruptly practiced. The fraud was practiced with a deliberate, knowing intent to deceive the court into making a decision favorable to the plaintiff, namely that plaintiff\u2019s profits were less than they actually were, and less excessive than the Renegotiation Board had determined. <em>Law v. United States, </em>195 Ct.Cl. 370, 440-41 (1971); <em>Little v. United States, </em>152 F.Supp. 84, 87, 138 Ct.Cl. 773, 778 (1957) (contract for services over a period of years held forfeited for fraud in the earlier years in connection with services not the subject of suit); <em>Kamen Soap Products Co. v. United States, </em>124 F.Supp. 608, 620, 129 Ct.Cl. 619, 641-42 (1954) (fraud in the prior administrative proceeding held to cause forfeiture of suit in this court); <em>Wagner Iron Works </em>v. <em>United States, supra </em>(forfeiture for fraud consisting of false vouchers in a termination claim); <em>cf. Kamen Soap Products Co. v. McElroy, </em>103 U.S.App.D.C. 203, 257 F.2d 207, 208 (1958); <em>Globe Indemnity Co. </em>v. <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"673\">*673</page-number><em>United States, </em>84 Ct.Cl. 587, 592-94, <em>cert. denied, </em>302 U.S. 707, 58 S.Ct. 26, 82 L.Ed. 546 (1937).</p>\n<p id=\"b747-6\">B. The Renegotiation Proceeding Under 50 U.S.C.App. \u00a7 1218 as a Claim Subject to Forfeiture under 28 U.S.C. \u00a7 2514</p>\n<p id=\"b747-7\">The next question, one of law, is whether the instant proceeding, a judicial proceeding for the redetermination of the excessiveness of profits under section 108 of the Renegotiation Act, 50 U.S.C.App. \u00a7 1218 (1970 &amp; Supp. V 1975), is a \u201cclaim against the United States\u201d within the meaning of 28 U.S.C. \u00a7 2514 (note 1, <em>supra).</em></p>\n<p id=\"b747-8\">Plaintiff contends that claims against the United States under section 2514 may include claims only for money, whereas this proceeding under the Renegotiation Act is a claim for a declaration that no excessive profits were realized in the year in question and, if anything, it is a claim for money by the United States and not by the plaintiff.</p>\n<p id=\"b747-9\">The contention raises issues as to whether the present proceeding is a claim for money and, if not, whether only a claim for money or property may be a \u201cclaim against the United States\u201d within section 2514. The final issue is the breadth of the category of \u201cclaims\u201d within the reach of section 2514.</p>\n<p id=\"b747-10\">1. <em>To What Extent is the Judicial Renegotiation Proceeding a Claim by the Plaintiff for Money or Property? </em>The following passage in the opinion in <em>Lykes Bros. S.S. Co. v. United States, supra, </em>459 F.2d at 1400, 198 Ct.Cl. at 325, is plaintiff\u2019s authority for the proposition that the proceeding under the Renegotiation Act for a redetermination of excessive profits as determined by the Renegotiation Board, is an action by the plaintiff for a declaratory judgment and by the Government for money:</p>\n<blockquote id=\"b747-11\">In fact, a renegotiation case is unlike any other case filed in this court, because the plaintiff here is not seeking to recover a money judgment against the United States. It is the Government, based upon a unilateral order of the Renegotiation Board, which asserts that the contractor owes it money. If the contractor wholly prevails, the court will enter a declaratory judgment that no excessive profits were realized during the year involved.</blockquote>\n<p id=\"b747-14\">These words were written in the course of a decision that the burden of proof of excessiveness rested on the Government, which must prove its contention that the contractor realized excessive profits. The description of the suit as one in which the Government asserts that the plaintiff owes it money was thus made in a context of an inquiry to divide and allot between the parties the burden of proof on the underlying issues. The quoted passage, while it characterizes elements of the proof to be made in the suit, is not a definitive characterization of the totality of the action as a \u201cclaim\u201d or not, and certainly not as a claim under 28 U.S.C. \u00a7 2514. Indeed, another characterization of the proceeding, in the same opinion, points the other way from plaintiff\u2019s conclusion from the quoted passage. The court also said, referring to the similarity of actions for declaratory judgments and suits in this court to redetermine excessive profits, that \u201cperhaps the best analogy involves those cases before the boards of contract appeals in which a contractor appeals from a contracting officer\u2019s assessment of extra costs.\u201d In such a case, the court continued, \u201cthe contractor has a right to a de novo hearing\u201d, and \u201c[hjere, as in those cases, the Government claims that the contractor owes it money.\u201d <em>Lykes Bros. S.S. Co. v. United States, supra, </em>459 F.2d at 1402-03, 198 Ct.Cl. at 329-30. Yet in these same contract appeals, the boards of contract appeals have held the contractors\u2019 appeals to be \u201cclaims against the United States\u201d within the meaning of regulations denying cost reimbursement to contractors of the expenses of \u201cclaims against the United States.\u201d <em>Reed &amp; Prince Mfg. Co., </em>ASBCA No. 3172, 59-1 BCA H 2172 (1959). The characterization of one proceeding by analogy to another is valid only in the context in which it is made.</p>\n<p id=\"b747-15\"><em>Lykes Bros. S.S. Co., </em>therefore, does not settle whether the characteristics of the judicial renegotiation suit, in terms of money passing are such as to make the suit one <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"674\">*674</page-number>for money under a rule which may define \u201ca claim against the United States\u201d as a demand for money. It was not relevant in that case, for instance, to explore the monetary consequences of the judgment sought by the plaintiff. That subject begins with the order of the Renegotiation Board determining the amount of a contractor\u2019s excessive profits for a given year.</p>\n<p id=\"b748-4\">The Renegotiation Act provides that the Renegotiation Board is authorized to reach agreement with the contractor subject to renegotiation, and if agreement cannot be reached, the Board may under section 105(a) of the Act issue an order, without due process standards, determining the amount of the contractor\u2019s excessive profits in the year under review, 50 U.S.C.App. \u00a7\u00a7 1215(a) and (b)(3) (1970 &amp; Supp. V 1975). The amount so determined, with a credit for taxes paid on the amount of profits which are determined to be excessive, may be collected by the Government by withholding of sums due either to the contractor or to other Government contractors who are indebted to the contractor. 50 U.S.C.App. \u00a7\u00a7 1215(b)(1), (b)(3), (b)(8) (1970 &amp; Supp. V 1975).</p>\n<p id=\"b748-5\">The . contractor may of course pay and seek no further relief, in which case the present question does not arise. Should he be aggrieved by an order of the Board, however, he may under section 108 of the Act (50 U.S.C.App. \u00a7 1218) file a petition with this court \u2014 such as the present action \u2014 for a redetermination of the amount of excessive profits.<footnotemark>2</footnotemark> The suit is to be heard and determined de novo, not as a proceeding to review the determination of the Board. The petition was prior to 1972 filed in the Tax Court; at that time jurisdiction was transferred to this Court. Act of July 1, 1971, Pub.L. No. 92-41, 85 Stat. 97, 50 U.S.C.App. \u00a7 1218 (Supp. V 1975).</p>\n<p id=\"b748-8\">If the contractor does not pay the amount ordered by the Board, and brings the proceeding for redetermination with which we are now concerned, the filing of the petition in this court acts as a stay of execution of the order of the Board if, but only if, within 10 days of the filing of the petition, the plaintiff files with the court a bond in the amount determined by the court. 50 U.S.C. App. \u00a7 1218 (Supp. V 1975). The court has provided in Rule 26 that the amount of the bond shall be 100 percent of the Board decision less applicable tax credits. Absent such a stay of execution, the Government will ordinarily be entitled to judgment on its customary counterclaim for the amount determined by the Board. In one case the court held that a contractor in bankruptcy might on prescribed proofs press his suit without filing a bond, in the interest of preserving his constitutional right to challenge the unilateral determination of the Board. <em>Sandnes\u2019 Sons, Inc. v. United States, </em>462 F.2d 1388, 199 Ct.Cl. 107 (1972). The instant petitioner applied for the same privilege, on the ground of financial hardship. It was denied relief, the Government was granted judgment on its counterclaim for $157,432.55, the amount ordered by the Board less applicable taxes, and the petitioner has satisfied the judgment. <em>O\u2019Brien Gear &amp; Machine Co. v. United States, </em>199 Ct.Cl. 1014 (1972). By and large, therefore, it may be said that substantially every petitioner who seeks a redetermination of ex<page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"675\">*675</page-number>cessive profits has or will be required either to pay the amount ordered by the Board before or during the pendency of his suit for redetermination, or to give security in the form of a bond for the amount. <em>Solitron Devices, Inc. v. United States, </em>537 F.2d 417, 210 Ct.Cl. 352 (1976), <em>cert. denied, </em>430 U.S. 930, 97 S.Ct. 1548, 51 L.Ed.2d 773 (1977).</p>\n<p id=\"b749-5\">If the contractor who has paid prevails in his suit for a redetermination, he will obtain a judgment determining in what amount, less than that determined by the Board, excessive profits were realized. No judgment is given in this court for the difference between the amounts determined by the Board and by this court; the court is limited to a determination that no excessive profits were realized or that excessive profits were realized in a stated amount less than that determined by the Board. But section 108 of the Act itself provides that the successful contractor is to receive a refund following a determination in his favor: \u201cAny amount collected by the United States under an order of the Board in excess of the amount found to be due under a determination of excessive profits by the Court of Claims shall be refunded to the contractor or subcontractor with interest . . . .\u201d 50 U.S.C.App. \u00a7 1218 (1970 &amp; Supp. V 1975). And so the court\u2019s conclusion of law in a case in which a contractor has been successful in part, has contained all of the following: a determination that the plaintiff realized excessive profits in a stated amount (less than that determined by the Board and paid by the plaintiff), a judgment for that amount in favor of the Government, on its customary counterclaim, and an order that \u201cplaintiff is entitled to a refund\u201d of the difference between the amount paid by it and the amount of the judgment on the counterclaim. <em>See Major Coat Co. v. United States, </em>543 F.2d 97, 124, 211 Ct.Cl. 1, 48-49 (1976).<footnotemark>3</footnotemark> The last provision \u2014 that plaintiff is \u201centitled\u201d to a refund \u2014 states the inevitable, whether or not it appears in the opinion of the court, once the contractor is successful to any degree.<footnotemark>4</footnotemark> The contractor who has filed a bond and who prevails obtains a release of his bond\u2014 an entire release if the decision is that his profits were not at all excessive, or a release conditioned on his payment of the amount determined.</p>\n<p id=\"b749-10\">Money or its equivalent, a bond for the payment of money, thus passes from the plaintiff to the Government in every suit for redetermination of profits and from the Government to the plaintiff as a consequence of every successful suit. The suit is thus in reality one for the release of the bond, if one was given, or the refund of the money paid over to the Government. Payment back of the money, if money was paid, will follow directly upon success in the suit. Entitlement having been determined by the court, the contractor who prevails obtains a refund, pursuant to the mandate of section 108 of the Act, quoted above, for a refund of any amount collected by the Government in excess of the amount found by the court to be excessive. The action, which in terms of burdens of proof may be one in which the Government asserts that plaintiff owes it money and which in form is an action by plaintiff for a declaratory judgment as to <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"676\">*676</page-number>excessiveness of profits, is thus also seen to be an action in which the plaintiff is seeking either a return of money paid over to the Government as a condition of bringing suit, or the release of the bond given as security for the payment of the money.</p>\n<p id=\"b750-4\">The next question is whether the action, understood as set out in the foregoing, is sufficiently an action for money to come within the rule, if such a rule there be, that \u201cclaims\u201d against the United States generally refer only to claims for money and property.</p>\n<p id=\"b750-5\">2. <em>May \u201cClaims\u201d Against the United States be Claims For Money or Property Only? </em>An application for a passport or an antitrust clearance letter, a suit for a mandatory transfer of public land, a declaratory judgment as to the applicability of a registration act or a money judgment for a commercial debt \u2014 all might reasonably be described as claims against the United States. The \u201cclaim against the United States\u201d to which consequences are ascribed in a statute,<footnotemark>5</footnotemark> is a claim for only money or property when, and only when, the statutory context and purpose so require.</p>\n<p id=\"b750-6\">In <em>United States </em>v. <em>Cohn, </em>270 U.S. 339, 345-46, 46 S.Ct. 251, 70 L.Ed. 616 (1926), the court held a false claim for the release from customs of non-dutiable goods in the hands of the United States as bailee not to be a \u201cclaim\u201d against the Government in violation of the False Claims Act, now 31 U.S.C. \u00a7\u00a7 231-235 (1970). The purpose of the statute was held determinative that the demand, though one for property, was not a claim against the United States. The decision recognized that while the word \u201cclaim\u201d may sometimes be used in the broad juridical sense of a demand as of right upon another to act as a matter of duty, \u201cit is clear, in the light of the entire context, that in the present statute\u201d the \u201cclaim upon or against\u201d the United States related \u201csolely to the payment or approval of a claim for money or property to which a right is asserted against the Government, based upon the Government\u2019s own liability to the claimant.\u201d 270 U.S. at 345-46, 46 S.Ct. at 253. Again, in <em>United States v. Bergson, </em>119 F.Supp. 459 (D.D.C.1954), the \u201cclaim\u201d against the Government in a conflict-of-interest law, former 18 U.S.C. \u00a7 284, was held not to include an application for an antitrust clearance letter, but to be limited to claims for money or property only.</p>\n<p id=\"b750-9\">The \u201cclaim\u201d under the False Claims Act has been the frequent subject of judicial decision. In <em>United States v. McNinch, </em>356 U.S. 595, 599, 78 S.Ct. 950, 2 L.Ed.2d 1001 (1958), it was held that a claim against the Government \u201cnormally\u201d connotes a demand for money or a transfer of public property, and does not for purposes of the False Claims Act include an application for credit insurance by the Federal Housing Administration. Such an application \u201cdoes not fairly come within the scope that Congress intended the Act to have.\u201d 356 U.S. at 599, 78 S.Ct. at 953. The provisions of such a criminal statute, the court said, \u201cmust be carefully restricted, not only to their literal terms but to the evident purpose of Congress in using those terms, particularly where they are broad and susceptible to numerous definitions.\u201d 356 U.S. at 598, 78 S.Ct. at 952.</p>\n<p id=\"b750-10\">A companion case to <em>McNinch, Rainwater v. United States, </em>356 U.S. 590, 78 S.Ct. 946, 2 L.Ed.2d 996 (1958), involved false applications for crop loans to the Commodity Credit Corporation. These the court held to be \u201cclaims\u201d against the Government in violation of the False Claims Act. The difference between the two cases, both involving the same statute, would seem to be the immediacy of the false demand with the consequent acquisition of public money. The Commodity Credit Corporation would make a loan directly upon approval of the <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"677\">*677</page-number>false application. The FHA\u2019s decision to insure a loan, however, the court said in <em>McNinch, </em>\u201cdisburses no funds nor does it otherwise suffer immediate financial detriment. It simply contracts, for a premium, to reimburse the lending institution in the event of future default, if any.\u201d 356 U.S. at 599, 78 S.Ct. at 952.</p>\n<p id=\"b751-5\">The tie between the claim and the money sought was again canvassed in <em>United States v. Neifert-White Co., </em>390 U.S. 228, 88 S.Ct. 959, 19 L.Ed.2d 1061 (1968) where the charge of violation of the False Claims Act was based on a false invoice for a grain storage bin, given to the bin dealer\u2019s customer for submission to the Commodity Credit Corporation in support of a loan application. The invoice was intended fraudulently to induce the Commodity Credit Corporation to extend a loan to the customer in excess of the maximum lawful percentage of the actual purchase price. The Supreme Court now held that the False Claims Act was \u201cintended to reach all types of fraud, without qualification, that might result in financial loss to the Government\u201d; former opinions were described as having \u201cconsistently refused to accept a rigid, restrictive reading\u201d of the Act, even in connection with the imposition of criminal sanctions. The false invoice was held a claim because it was a \u201cstatement made with the purpose and effect of inducing the Government immediately to part with money.\u201d \u201cThis remedial statute reaches beyond \u2018claims\u2019 which might be legally enforced, to all fraudulent attempts to cause the Government to pay out sums of money.\u201d 390 U.S. at 232-33, 88 S.Ct. at 961-962.</p>\n<p id=\"b751-7\">These cases, taken together, show that the permissible chain of causation between the false statement and its success may thus lengthen, depending on the purpose of the statute to reach the falsity presented. In <em>Neifert-White </em>the bin dealer passed a false invoice to his customer, who attached it to his loan application to the Commodity Credit Corporation. In <em>United States ex rel. Marcus v. Hess, </em>317 U.S. 537, 63 S.Ct. 379, 87 L.Ed.2d 443 (1943), the chain was much longer. There the False Claims Act was held to apply to contractors who presented collusive bids on public projects to the local officers of a Pennsylvania county, received awards of contracts from those authorities, and ultimately obtained payment under the contracts in the form of a check drawn by the county authorities on an account containing both federal and local funds.</p>\n<p id=\"b751-10\">A \u201cclaim\u201d may be found to exist, if the statutory purpose requires it, even when money is not its object. This was recently illustrated by the decision in <em>Grumman Aerospace Corp., </em>NASA BCA Nos. 823-11, 1073-15, 76-1 BCA \u00b6 11,763 (1976)<footnotemark>6</footnotemark> that a contractor\u2019s attorneys fees in a proceeding to redetermine profits under the Renegotiation Act (the very kind of case such as the one at bar) are a non-allowable cost to a cost-reimbursable contractor under the prohibition in the NASA procurement regulations, 41 C.F.R. \u00a7 18-15.205-31(d), of the reimbursement of the costs of \u201cprosecution of claims against the Government.\u201d Under the same language in the Armed Services Procurement Regulation it has been held that a proceeding for an injunction against the United States is a claim against the United States and its costs are therefore not allowable. <em>Hayes International Corp., </em>ASBCA No. 18,447, 75-1 BCA \u00b6 11,076 (1975); <em>see </em>ASPR \u00a7 15-205.31(d), 32 C.F.R. \u00a7 15-205.31(d) (1975).</p>\n<p id=\"b751-11\">If the rule is as urged by the plaintiff\u2014 that money must be the objective of a \u201cclaim\u201d against the United States \u2014 the nature of the renegotiation proceeding has been shown, above, to be sufficiently a claim, in the words of the Supreme Court, \u201cwith the purpose and effect of inducing the Government immediately to part with money.\u201d <em>United States v. Neifert-White Co., supra, </em>390 U.S. at 232, 88 S.Ct. at 961. But the rule which emerges from the deci<page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"678\">*678</page-number>sions is rather that \u201cclaim\u201d is a word of many meanings, to be determined in the context of the purpose of the statute in which it is found. In the False Claims Act, which was remedially aimed at all types of financial frauds on the Government, the \u201cclaim\u201d against the Government is held to be conduct which after some intermediate steps has the effect of bringing about a payment of money or other financial loss by the Government. Under other statutes, in the light of their statutory purpose the objective of the claim need not be money. None of the cases on the subject of the scope of \u201cclaims\u201d as claims for money or otherwise, however, are cases under section 2514 of the Judicial Code. The precise, determinative inquiry must therefore be focused on section 2514. The answer calls for study of the purpose and intent of the provisions of section 2514 of the Judicial Code for the forfeiture of claims in the Court of Claims sought to be proven by fraud. Does the section reach so far as the renegotiation proceeding now before the court?</p>\n<p id=\"b752-4\">3. <em>The Breadth of the Category of \u201cClaims\u201d Subject to Forfeiture in 28 U.S.C. \u00a7 2514. </em>The source of present-day section 2514 of Title 28 is the Court <em>of </em>Claims Act of March 3, 1863, ch. 92, 12 Stat. 765. This statute transformed the Court of Claims from a body merely advisory to Congress into a court with power to entertain claims, subject to a statute of limitations, hear the Government\u2019s counterclaims and enter judgments to be paid out of a general appropriation. <em>Compare </em>the Act of February 24, 1855, ch. 122, 10 Stat. 612. Section 11 of the 1863 Act, 12 Stat. at 767, contained what is now codified in 28 U.S.C. \u00a7 2514, note 1, <em>supra.</em></p>\n<p id=\"b752-10\">The Act of March 3,1863 was passed by the same session of the 37th Congress as enacted the False Claims Act. In the latter Act \u201cthe objective of Congress was broadly to protect the funds and property of the Government from fraudulent claims, regardless of the particular form, or function, of the government instrumentality upon which such claims were made.\u201d <em>Rainwater </em>v. <em>United States, supra, </em>356 U.S. at 592, 78 S.Ct. at 948. The 37th Congress was no less determined in the Court of Claims Act to protect the United States from frauds committed in the proof of claims before the newly empowered Court of Claims. The debates on the Court of Claims Act contain repeated references to the frauds which had accompanied the past consideration of claims in the Congress, to the firmness of the Congressional intention to guard against such frauds in the claims in the court and to the purpose of what is now section 2514 as a preventative and a penalty-<footnotemark>7</footnotemark></p>\n<p id=\"b752-11\">Congress\u2019s purpose to prevent and punish fraud in the Court of Claims was aimed at all who committed fraud and thus at all plaintiffs in the court. No intention can be surmised that some who committed fraud in the proof of their demand would be exempt from the forfeiture provided in section 11 by reason of some narrow definition of the woi\u2019d \u201cclaim.\u201d</p>\n<p id=\"b753-4\"><page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"679\">*679</page-number>The words of section 11 reflect the intention to equate claims with all suits and to equate the persons subject to forfeiture with all plaintiffs who committed fraud (12 Stat. at 767):</p>\n<blockquote id=\"b753-5\">Sec. 11. And be it further enacted, That any person or persons who shall corruptly practise or attempt to practise any fraud against the United States in the proof, statement, establishment, or allowance of any claim, or any part of any claim against the United States, shall ipso facto forfeit the same to the Government; and it shall be the duty of the court of claims, in such cases, to find specifically that such fraud was practised or attempted to be practised, and thereupon give judgment that such claim is forfeited to the Government, and that the claimant be forever barred from prosecuting the same. Appeals may be taken from the court of claims to the supreme court, in all such cases, on all questions of law, in the manner herein provided for appeals in other cases.</blockquote>\n<p id=\"b753-6\">The breadth of the application of the section is repeatedly seen in the forcible quality of the phrases used. The forfeiture is to apply to \u201cany person or persons\u201d who practice or \u201cattempt\u201d to practice \u201cany\u201d fraud, whether in the \u201cproof, statement, establishment, or allowance\u201d of \u201cany claim, or any part of any claim.\u201d The forfeiture is to take place \u201cipso facto\u201d on the practicing or the attempt. Judgment as to practicing or attempting to practice fraud shall be given and shall provide \u201cthat the claimant be forever barred from prosecuting the same.\u201d</p>\n<p id=\"b753-7\">Over the years the codifiers have reduced the original energetic language to the two concise sentences which now compose section 2514:</p>\n<blockquote id=\"b753-8\">A claim against the United States shall be forfeited to the United States by any person who corruptly practices or attempts to practice any fraud against the United States in the proof, statement, establishment, or allowance thereof.</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b753-9\">In such cases the Court of Claims shall specifically find such fraud or attempt and render judgment of forfeiture.</blockquote>\n<p id=\"b753-10\">\u201cChanges,\u201d the codifiers well say, \u201cwere made in phraseology.\u201d One change was the omission of the forfeiture of \u201cany part of any claim.\u201d Another was the omission of the \u201cipso facto\u201d nature of the forfeiture, perhaps an unrealistic expectation in view of the provision for a judgment of forfeiture. Still another was the loss of the prescription that \u201cthe claimant be forever barred from prosecuting\u201d the forfeited claim.</p>\n<p id=\"b753-11\">More relevant for the present inquiry was the change in the orientation of the section, from a penalty on persons to a penalty on claims. Whereas section 11 was directed at \u201cany person or persons\u201d who engaged in the forbidden conduct, the passive language of section 2514 reads that a \u201cclaim\u201d \u201cshall be forfeited * * * by any person\u201d who practices the forbidden conduct. In the statute as enacted in 1863, moreover, the \u201cperson,\u201d the \u201cclaimant\u201d and the party plaintiff were all equivalents. The \u201cperson\u201d practicing fraud was undoubtedly the possessor of the claim, that is, the plaintiff. The clause barring him from further prosecution called him the \u201cclaimant.\u201d This original stress on the person who committed the fraud signified the intention that all persons, without qualification, and thus that all plaintiffs should be subject, on their commission of fraud, to the penalty of forfeiture of their claim.</p>\n<p id=\"b753-12\">The section immediately preceding section 11, providing for a 6-year statute of limitations, began with the words \u201c[tjhat every claim against the United States, cognizable by the court of claims, shall be forever barred unless * * * .\u201d 12 Stat. at 767. And so its present-day successor, section 2501 of Title 28, provides that \u201c[ejvery claim of which the Court of Claims has jurisdiction shall be barred * * *.\u201d Who can doubt that had the framers of section 11 in 1863 eared to write so as to impose the forfeiture on \u201cclaims\u201d instead of \u201cpersons,\u201d they would have opened the section with the words \u201cevery claim,\u201d as they had in the section preceding? Fraudulent claims were at least as much disapproved as stale claims.</p>\n<p id=\"b754-3\"><page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"680\">*680</page-number>No distinction among petitioners or claims was intended or even intimated. All those who made claims in the Court of Claims were to be subject to section 11, not only a limited class who had money claims. True, in the years to come the Supreme Court would hold that the statute as enacted in 1863 committed to the Court of Claims jurisdiction of claims for money only and excluded claims for property, decrees of specific performance or declaratory judgments. <em>United States </em>v. <em>Jones, </em>131 U.S. 1, 9 S.Ct. 669, 33 L.Ed. 90 (1899); <em>United States v. King, </em>395 U.S. 1, 89 S.Ct. 1501, 23 L.Ed.2d 52 (1969); <em>cf. United States </em>v. <em>Alire, </em>73 U.S. (6 Wall.) 573, 18 L.Ed. 947 (1868); <em>Bonner v. United States, </em>76 U.S. (9 Wall.) 156, 19 L.Ed. 666 (1870). But the bill which became the Act of March 3, 1863 as first enacted by the House conferred on the Court of Claims jurisdiction of all claims for which the Government would be liable in law or in equity, if it were suable in a court of justice. Cong. Globe, 37 Cong., 2d Sess. app. 124 (1862). Only in the Senate was the bill amended to read as it did on enactment, giving little new jurisdiction to the court over the original jurisdiction in the 1855 bill. Cong. Globe, 37th Cong., 3rd Sess. 306 (1863); Act of March 3, 1863, ch. 92, \u00a7 3,12 Stat. 765; <em>cf. </em>Act of February 24, 1855, ch. 122, \u00a7 1, 10 Stat. 612.</p>\n<p id=\"b754-4\">The conclusion to be drawn from the legislative history of section 2514, therefore, is that Congress intended by it that every suit brought in the Court of Claims should be subject to the forfeiture provided, on the commission of the specified fraud. This court has faithfully so applied the section. In no case has the court held section 2514 or its predecessors inapplicable because of the type of claim made, once proof of the requisite fraud was shown. <em>See, e. g., Jerman </em>v. <em>United States, </em>96 Ct.Cl. 540 (1942) (contract for sale of goods); <em>Furay v. United States, </em>34 Ct.Cl. 171 (1899) (officer\u2019s suit for accounting); <em>Standard Oil Co. v.

The court adjudged a forfeiture under the predecessor of section 2514, rejecting the defense that a fraudulent invoice was not a \u201cclaim\u201d under the statute. The right to sue under the jurisdictional act, the court held, was the claim.</p>\n<p id=\"b754-8\"><em>Furay v. United States, supra, </em>was a suit by a Government officer for an accounting under the predecessor of present 28 U.S.C. \u00a7 1494, a form of jurisdiction first entrusted to the Court of Claims by the Tucker Act of March 3, 1887, ch. 359, \u00a7 3, 24 Stat. 505. Without hesitation the court applied the forfeiture provision, enacted in 1863, to the officer\u2019s suit for an accounting of which jurisdiction was acquired in 1887.</p>\n<p id=\"b754-9\">In the light of the close similarity between the instant renegotiation action and the action for an accounting by an officer, <em>Furay </em>is direct authority for the applicability of the forfeiture provision of 1863 to the renegotiation proceeding entrusted to the court in 1971, in the Act of July 1, 1971, Pub.L. No. 92 \u2014 41, \u00a7\u00a7 3-4, 85 Stat. 97, 50 U.S.C.App. \u00a7 1218 (Supp. V 1975).<footnotemark>8</footnotemark></p>\n<p id=\"b754-10\">The Tucker Act had provided for a suit by an officer to settle his account in which the court was to \u201cproceed to hear the parties and to ascertain the amount, if any, due to the United States on said account.\u201d Payment by the petitioner should \u201cdischarge such obligation,\u201d and \u201c[a]n action shall accrue to the United States against such principal, or surety, or representative to recover the amount so found due,\u201d which action might be brought within 3 years and <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"681\">*681</page-number>if not brought would be barred. Mar. 3, 1887, 24 Stat. at 506. Act of</p>\n<p id=\"b755-3\">Here, then, was an action for a declaratory judgment as to how much money, if any, was due the United States. In such a suit, the petitioner would doubtless contend that no or little money was due to the Government, and the Government would assert that the plaintiff owed it a larger sum. The court was not to enter judgment for the amount determined to be due.<footnotemark>9</footnotemark> Once the amount was determined, and if the petitioner did not pay, the Government could sue the officer for the sum involved. This description of the officer\u2019s accounting suit is substantially the same as the characterization of the judicial renegotiation proceeding in <em>Lykes Bros. S.S. Co. v. United States, supra, </em>on which plaintiff relies so heavily. Both actions were added to the jurisdiction of the Court of Claims long after the enactment of the forfeiture statute. Both, equally, are claims against the United States subject to forfeiture under section 2514.</p>\n<p id=\"b755-4\">The contention that the renegotiation proceeding is not a claim against the United States within the meaning of 28 U.S.C. \u00a7 2514 is rejected, and fraud having been found to be practiced in the proof of the claim, the claim is forfeited, and the petition is dismissed.</p>\n<p id=\"b755-5\">II</p>\n<p id=\"b755-6\">The Failure of Proof of a Prima Facie Case</p>\n<p id=\"b755-7\">The Government\u2019s further defense, beyond the plea of forfeiture for fraud, is that the claim should be dismissed for failure to make the prima facie case required of the plaintiff. Reliance for this defense is placed on the same data as is said to support the first defense \u2014 the showing as to the unreliable and fraudulent nature of the proof presented by plaintiff in support of its case.</p>\n<p id=\"b755-10\">This defense, too, is sustained.</p>\n<p id=\"b755-11\">The financial data submitted by plaintiff, already described, is held insufficient to meet plaintiff\u2019s burden of showing what were its sales, costs and profits. Plaintiff\u2019s ledgers and journals are so lacking in substantiation, so shown to have been false and fraudulent in matters of payments, invoices, checks and other disbursements as to require their rejection as wholly untrustworthy. In addition to the frauds in these books affirmatively demonstrated, there is plaintiff\u2019s conviction for removing and destroying its records, when they were subpoenaed by a grand jury. The possibility of further unknown frauds is great. All in all, plaintiff\u2019s books and records are deprived of all trustworthiness and thus of any probative value. In a word, plaintiff has legally speaking failed to prove any of its sales, costs and profits. Accordingly, it has failed to meet the burden imposed on it of making a prima facie case in this proceeding, a major element of which is a showing of its costs and profits. <em>Lykes Bros. S.S. Co. v. United States, supra, </em>459 F.2d at 1401, 198 Ct.Cl. at 326-27.</p>\n<p id=\"b755-12\">It is only the ultimate burden which under <em>Lykes Bros. S.S. Co. </em>rests on the Government. The plaintiff must under that decision file suit and bear the first burden of proof as to its profits and costs and also \u201cthe initial burden of going forward with proof as to the statutory factors upon which it relies,\u201d to the extent it has knowledge of these matters, to show nonexcessiveness of its profits. When the plaintiff fails to make out its prima facie case, the ultimate burden does not shift to the Government and plaintiff\u2019s action is dismissed. <em>Lykes Bros. S.S. Co. v. United States, supra; cf. Aero Spacelines, Inc. v. United States, </em>530 F.2d 324, 332-33, 208 Ct.Cl. 704, 716-17 (1976).</p>\n<p id=\"b755-13\">The proof as to plaintiff\u2019s entitlement to consideration under the statutory factors of <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"682\">*682</page-number>50 U.S.C.App. \u00a7 1213(e) is in the same state as its proof of profits and costs. Plaintiff\u2019s books and the testimony of its president, the only evidence on the subject of plaintiff\u2019s entitlement to consideration under the statutory factors, have been found to be unworthy of any credence. It follows that plaintiff has failed utterly to show that it is entitled to favorable consideration on any inquiry into the excessiveness of its profits. Some letters from Naval officers that plaintiff performed \u201ca job well done\u201d in the delivery of \u201cvital electronic repair parts\u201d are dismissed as far outweighed by the conclusive showing that plaintiff regularly supplied substandard goods, with knowledge of their failure to meet specifications. Plaintiff thus failed, too, to meet the burden of proof, to the extent even of information available to it, of showing that it is entitled to favorable consideration under 50 U.S.C. App. \u00a7 1213(e). The foregoing conclusions as to the state of plaintiff\u2019s proof \u2014 both of its costs and profits and the statutory factors \u2014 are an alternative ground for the dismissal of the petition.</p>\n<p id=\"b756-4\">Finally, it may be noted that were the issue presented for decision, the evidence in the record of plaintiff\u2019s deliberate, gross and fraudulent deviations from the specifications in numbers of Government defense contracts would go far to deprive plaintiff of a favorable consideration in any determination as to the excessiveness of its profits. Plaintiff\u2019s contribution to national defense was negative. It supplied defective parts for a range of weapons of war \u2014 machine guns, aircraft, guided missiles and tanks. The supply of defective parts for the operation of weapons in time of war is a direct and serious harm to national defense. <em>United States v. United States Cartridge Co., </em>95 F.Supp. 384 (E.D.Mo.1950), <em>aff\u2019d </em>198 F.2d 456 (8th Cir. 1952), <em>cert. denied, </em>345 U.S. 910, 73 S.Ct. 645, 97 L.Ed. 1345 (1953). Such evidence would raise questions, too, under the Renegotiation Act\u2019s factors of efficiency, reasonableness of costs and profits, contribution to the national defense, the public interest and fair dealing. 50 U.S.C. App. \u00a7 1213(e). These questions need not, however, be determined, in view of the judgment of forfeiture and the Government\u2019s waiver, on such a judgment, of any claim for a determination of excessiveness in an amount greater than that made by the Board.</p>\n<p id=\"b756-6\">In conclusion, it is held that plaintiff\u2019s attempted proof of its claim was pervaded by fraud, corruptly practiced, and that the claim is accordingly adjudged to be forfeited under 28 U.S.C. \u00a7 2514. Judgment of forfeiture is entered on defendant\u2019s counterclaim and the petition is dismissed.</p>\n<p id=\"b756-7\">CONCLUSION OF LAW</p>\n<p id=\"b756-8\">The claim of the plaintiff is adjudged forfeited pursuant to 28 U.S.C. \u00a7 2514.
