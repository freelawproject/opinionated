MORGAN, Circuit Judge:</author>\n<p id=\"b393-16\">This appeal<footnotemark>1</footnotemark> concerns primarily an action for damages by Johnnie L. Horn (Horn), an employee of Bama Utility Contractors, Inc. (Bama), against C. L. Osborn Contracting Company (Osborn) for on-the-job injuries.</p>\n<p id=\"b393-17\">FACTS</p>\n<p id=\"b393-18\">The Board of Water Commissioners of the City of Columbus, Georgia contracted with Osborn, as a general contractor, to construct certain improvements in its sewer system. Osborn thereafter subcontracted a portion of the work to Bama. Bama was furnished with a copy of the plans and specifications applicable to the area where Bama was to perform its subcontract work together with a design plan which had been supplied to Osborn by the Board of Water Commissioners. Thereafter Bama used its own equipment and employees in carrying out its work and Osborn provided no equipment or employees with respect thereto.<footnotemark>2</footnotemark> At all times mentioned herein the plaintiff, Horn, was an employee of Bama and was directly supervised by other employees of Bama. His work consisted of the laying of sewer pipe in an excavation or ditch. While so employed he sustained personal injuries on two separate occasions. On July 2,1974, while Horn was working in a ditch excavated to a depth of approximately 16 feet, the sides of the ditch caved in causing Horn certain personal injuries. Having recovered from the injuries sustained in that incident, Horn returned to his job and was working on the same project in another ditch approximately 9 feet deep when, on October 9, 1974, he sustained additional personal injuries when the sides of this ditch caved in.</p>\n<p id=\"b394-3\"><page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"320\">*320</page-number>Horn concedes that he was an employee of Bama, and not of Osborn and that the relationship of Bama to Osborn was that of an independent contractor. Furthermore, Horn concedes that because of the injuries above referred to, he has received the benefits provided by the Workmans Compensation insurance coverage carried by Bama. In this action Horn seeks to recover general damages from the general contractor Osborn.</p>\n<p id=\"b394-4\">Osborn, under an indemnity provision contained in the subcontract, filed a third party action against Bama claiming a contingent right to recover against Bama in the event of any recovery by Horn against Osborn.</p>\n<p id=\"b394-5\">The district court granted a motion for summary judgment filed by Osborn and further granted the motion for summary judgment filed by Bama, reasoning, as to the latter, that since any liability of the Third Party Defendant Bama is contingent upon Osborn\u2019s liability the motion filed by Bama must also be sustained.</p>\n<p id=\"b394-6\">DISCUSSION</p>\n<p id=\"b394-7\">Georgia law applies in this case and Ga. Code Ann. \u00a7 105-501 provides:</p>\n<blockquote id=\"b394-8\">The employer generally is not responsible for torts committed by his employee when the latter exercises an independent business, and is not subject to the immediate direction and control of the employer.</blockquote>\n<p id=\"b394-9\">There are, however, certain statutory exceptions to this general rule and Horn contends that the facts of this case bring his action within some of those exceptions.</p>\n<p id=\"b394-10\">In our review of this case, because the essential facts are not in dispute, the question of the legal relations arising therefrom is one of law and the district court\u2019s determination is not insulated by the \u201cclearly erroneous\u201d rule. Therefore, this court is free to substitute its judgment on the law before it.</p>\n<p id=\"b394-13\">The first arguably applicable statutory exception imposes liability on the employer (general contractor Osborn)</p>\n<blockquote id=\"b394-14\">[i]f, according to previous knowledge and experience, the work to be done is in its nature dangerous to others, however carefully performed.</blockquote>\n<p id=\"b394-15\">Ga.Code Ann. \u00a7 105-502(2).</p>\n<p id=\"b394-16\">In construing this section, Georgia courts have held that work is not \u201cdangerous to others, however carefully performed\u201d if the danger results from doing the work in an unsafe manner when there is a safe way of doing the work. <em>Hodge v. United States, </em>310 F.Supp. 1090, 1104 (M.D.Ga.1969), <em>affirmed and adopted, </em>424 F.2d 545 (5th Cir. 1970). Here it is undisputed that there were in fact several safe ways of doing the work, e. g., bracing, sheeting or \u201cV\u201ding the ditch. Consequently, we find that the construction of the sewer line involving the excavation of the ditch, when viewed in the light of the undisputed facts reflected by the record, was not inherently dangerous,<footnotemark>3</footnotemark> and was not \u201cin its nature dangerous to others, however carefully performed,\u201d so as to charge Osborn with the duty of providing Horn a safe place to work.</p>\n<p id=\"b394-17\">The second arguably applicable statutory exception imposes liability on the employer (general contractor Osborn)</p>\n<blockquote id=\"b394-18\">[i]f the wrongful act is the violation of a duty imposed by statute.</blockquote>\n<p id=\"b394-19\">Ga.Code Ann. \u00a7 105-502(4). Horn argues that the contract between the general contractor and the subcontractor is subject to the Occupational Safety and Health Act (OSHA).<footnotemark>4</footnotemark> Consequently, there was imposed upon the general contractor a duty to abide by the regulations promulgated under OSHA as they applied to the excavation and the shoring of the walls of ditches.<footnotemark>5</footnotemark> Additionally, Horn argues that, assuming OSHA applies, Section 653(b)(2) makes standards promulgated under other health and safety acts applicable to employees cov<page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"321\">*321</page-number>ered by OSHA<footnotemark>6</footnotemark> and that one such standard is a regulation promulgated under the Contract Work Hours and Safety Standards Act<footnotemark>7</footnotemark> (CWHSSA) which imposes joint and several responsibility on the general contractor.<footnotemark>8</footnotemark></p>\n<p id=\"b395-5\">In addressing these arguments we find it unnecessary to decide whether in this particular instance there was, as Osborn argues, an inappropriate attempt at a private action based solely on a violation of OSHA<footnotemark>9</footnotemark> or, as Horn asserts, an independent right of action created by Georgia statute. For even were we to agree with Horn that Osborn was \u201cengaged in a business affecting commerce\u201d so as to be within OSHA\u2019s definition of an employer<footnotemark>10</footnotemark> and that an independent right of action was thereby created by Georgia statute, it seems that OSHA, by its own terms, precludes its applicability.</p>\n<p id=\"b395-6\">We reach this conclusion only after a thorough analysis of the provision on which Horn\u2019s argument is founded, 29 U.S.C. \u00a7 654(a), which provides:</p>\n<blockquote id=\"b395-7\">Each employer</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b395-8\">(1) shall furnish to each of his employees employment and a place of employment which are free from recognized hazards that are causing or likely to cause death or serious physical harm to his employees.</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b395-9\">(2) shall comply with occupational safety and health standards promulgated under this chapter.</blockquote>\n<p id=\"b395-10\">Stated precisely, our inquiry focuses on whether the term \u201cemployer\u201d as used in \u00a7 654(a) should be interpreted to envelop general contractors as joint or statutory employers of an independent subcontractor\u2019s employees and thus impose upon them a duty to provide the employee with a safe working environment. In making our determination we are guided by our decision in <em>Southeast Contractors, Inc. v. Dunlop, </em>512 F.2d 675 (5th Cir. 1975), in which we reversed the decision of the Occupational Safety and Review Commission, reported at 1 OSHC 1713 (1974), and expressed our agreement with the well reasoned dissent of Chairman Moran. In his dissent Chairman Moran in construing the word \u201cemployer\u201d as it is used in \u00a7 654(a), first points out that the provision does not necessarily mean that the employer is in violation of 29 U.S.C. \u00a7 654(a)(2) for every failure to comply with a safety standard which occurs within its worksite. He explained that an employer cannot be held in violation of the above subsection if <em>his </em>employees are not affected by the noncompliance with a standard. And if there was any doubt as to what he meant by <em>\u201chis </em>employee\u201d this was eliminated by his reiteration of the general rule that a contractor is not responsible for the acts of his subcontractors or their employees. In light of this precedent and because it is conceded that Horn was an employee of Bama, we must hold this \u201cstatutory duty\u201d exception inapplicable.</p>\n<p id=\"b395-14\">The third arguably applicable statutory exception imposes liability on an employer (general contractor Osborn)</p>\n<blockquote id=\"b395-15\">[i]f the wrongful act is the violation of a duty imposed by express contract upon the employer.</blockquote>\n<p id=\"b395-16\">Ga.Code Ann. \u00a7 105-502(3). Horn argues that because the general contract between the Board of Water Commissioners and Osborn imposed a duty to abide by the regula<page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"322\">*322</page-number>tions promulgated under OSHA and Section 107 of CWHSSA,<footnotemark>11</footnotemark> that when those regulations were not followed the resulting breach of duty was sufficient to impose liability based upon the above \u201cexpress duty\u201d exception.<footnotemark>12</footnotemark> The district court, however, interpreted the contractual provision as requiring that Osborn abide by the regulations only if the underlying Acts were applicable by their terms (which they are not as discussed earlier). Additionally, Osborn contends that the regulations under OSHA could be no broader in their application than the specific congressional intent behind the act from which they were promulgated. This intent was declared to be, at 29 U.S.C. \u00a7653(b)(4), that OSHA would not in any manner affect, enlarge, or diminish the rights, duties, or liabilities of employers and employees. Consequently, Osborn asserts that the regulations cannot be utilized to expand its liability to Bama\u2019s employee Horn. It seems to this court, however, that the focus has been on the statutes themselves when it should have been on the contract. It is clear that the contract incorporated the <em>regulations </em>only, not the Acts.<footnotemark>13</footnotemark> It is obvious that Osborn and the Board of Water Commissioners referred to and incorporated the OSHA and CWHSSA regulations as a mere convenience to relieve them from having to draw up their own set of construction guidelines. Hence, we think it apparent that the contract sought to incorporate discernible standards for safe construction and not the nebulous intentions of Congress as to the scope of the Act\u2019s application.</p>\n<p id=\"b396-9\">We find, therefore, that there was a duty imposed upon Osborn by an express contract provision. Consequently, Ga.Code Ann. \u00a7 105-502(3) applies to provide Horn with an exception to the general rule of nonliability of a general contractor for the acts of his independent subcontractor.<footnotemark>14</footnotemark> Accordingly, the district court is reversed as to this issue.</p>\n<p id=\"b396-10\">Finally, this court agrees with the district court in its finding that there is no factual basis for Horn\u2019s allegation that the proximate cause of his injuries was the \u201cwilful and wanton negligence\u201d of Osborn in permitting Horn to work in a ditch that had been improperly opened and in failing to provide safeguards to prevent the ditch from collapsing.</p>\n<p id=\"b396-11\">The ruling of the district court granting Osborn\u2019s motion for summary judgment is reversed and remanded for proceedings not inconsistent with this opinion. Accordingly, the ruling of the district court granting Bama\u2019s motion for summary judgment is also reversed and remanded.</p>\n<p id=\"b396-12\">REVERSED and REMANDED.</p>\n<footnote label=\"1\">\n<p id=\"b393-13\">. The jurisdiction of the district court was based upon 28 U.S.C. \u00a7 1332 (1966) in that the plaintiff and the defendant are citizens of different states and the matter in controversy exceeds $10,000 exclusive of interest and costs.</p>\n</footnote>\n<footnote label=\"2\">\n<p id=\"b393-14\">. Bama hired, fired and supervised its own employees and Osborn did not at any time hire, fire or supervise any employee working with Bama and Osborn did not supervise any work activity performed by Bama or exercise any control or supervision over any employee of Bama. The Board of Water Commissioners furnished an engineer-inspector on the entire project and that inspector, as well as an inspector for Osborn, did inspect the work product of Bama; however, these periodic visits were only for the purpose of observing the progress that was being made toward completion of the job and did not involve any direction as to how the work was to be accomplished by Bama.</p>\n</footnote>\n<footnote label=\"3\">\n<p id=\"b394-11\">.

L. Osborn Contracting Company incorporated in its contract the OSHA and CWHSSA regulations as a convenient set of construction guidelines for this work; the failure to follow these guidelines caused the \u00bfccident; although an employer is generally not responsible for the torts committed by an independent contractor [Ga.Code Ann. \u00a7 105-501], the employer is liable \u201cif the wrongful act is the violation of a duty imposed by express contract upon the employer\u201d [Ga.Code Ann. \u00a7 105-502(3)]; since the failure to follow the guidelines was a \u201cwrongful act\u201d and violated the duty imposed by contract, the employer is liable. I disagree that the beneficiary of this contractually grounded liability can be the employee of the subcontractor who undertook to perform the work under the contract.</p>\n<p id=\"b397-5\">In this case, the entire section of the construction project was subcontracted to Horn\u2019s employer, Bama Utility Contractors, Inc. Bama Utility undertook all facets of the work, including the digging of the trenches which allegedly caused its employee\u2019s injuries. To permit an employee of a subcontractor to recover against the general contractor because the subcontractor improperly performed its contract with the general contractor seems to me to fly in the face of settled jurisprudence in this field of law. This is not a case where Osborn has been called upon to respond in damages for negligence to either the owner, with which it contracted, or any third party injured by the work. The claimant, rather, is one who was at all times subject to the immediate and exclusive supervision and control of the party whose dereliction of duty caused his injury. Osborn\u2019s own employees, if they had been doing the work, would be limited to workmen\u2019s compensation benefits. Why should the employees of a subcontractor who has undertaken all of the work on this section be in any better position?</p>\n<p id=\"b397-6\">The fallacy of the result here reached would be starkly presented if Horn <em>were </em>the subcontractor, a sole proprietor, doing all the work himself. If he did not perform according to the contract\u2019s safety requirements and was injured thereby, his suit against the general contractor would be based on the theory that his own failure to properly do the work was a breach of contract between the general contractor and the owner.</p>\n<p id=\"b397-7\">None of the cases cited even remotely suggests that an employee of an independent contractor is a person within the scope and protection of the statute\u2019s protection contained in Ga.Code Ann. \u00a7 105-502(3) and I am unwilling to interpret that provision to reach such an anomalous result. I would affirm the district court across the board.</p>\n</opinion>\n</casebody>\n",
