He was sentenced to one year imprisonment on each count, the sentences to run concurrently, and a $5,000 fine on each count. The issues raised by Cathey on appeal can be grouped into three categories: (1) government misconduct before the grand jury; (2) Jencks Act material; and (3) introduction of a 16-year-old military conviction for larceny. We find no merit to the claims under the first two headings but conclude that it was prejudicial error to admit the military conviction into evidence. We reverse and remand.</p>\n<p id=\"b345-16\">I. Government misconduct before the grand jury</p>\n<p id=\"b345-17\">A. False statements</p>\n<p id=\"b345-18\">While testifying before the grand jury, special agent Derry of the IRS made three statements which defendant says were false, known to the government to be false, and material. Under <em>U. S. v. Basurto, </em>497 F.2d 781 (CA9, 1974), defendant urges that the government had a constitutional obligation to inform court, counsel and grand jury about the statements and that its failure to do so requires dismissal of the indictment.<footnotemark>1</footnotemark></p>\n<blockquote id=\"b345-19\">In <em>Basurto, </em>the Ninth Circuit held that the Due Process Clause of the Fifth Amendment is violated when a defendant has to stand trial on an indictment which the government knows is based partially on perjured testimony, when the perjured testimony is material, and when jeopardy has not attached. Whenever the prosecutor learns of any perjury committed before the grand jury, he is under a duty to immediately inform the court and opposing counsel \u2014 and, if the perjury may be material, also the grand jury \u2014 in order that appropriate action may be taken.</blockquote>\n<p id=\"A5P\"><em>Id. </em>at 785-86. A subsequent Ninth Circuit opinion, <em>U. S. </em>v. <em>Bracy, </em>566 F.2d 649 (CA9, 1977), <em>cert. </em>denied, -U.S. -, 99 S.Ct. 79, 58 L.Ed.2d 109 (1978), has not only cut <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"272\">*272</page-number>back on the reach of <em>Basurto </em>but has also questioned its continuing validity.<footnotemark>2</footnotemark> This court has never decided whether to adopt the constitutional rule laid down in <em>Basurto</em><footnotemark>3</footnotemark> or the modified rule of <em>Bracy.</em><footnotemark><em>4</em></footnotemark><em> </em>Nor do we decide that issue today. A prerequisite to the applicability of the <em>Basurto </em>rule is a finding that the government witness perjured himself. In the case before us the district court, doubtful whether there were any misstatements, concluded that, if there were, there was no evidence that Derry \u201cdeliberately attempted to mislead, certainly no evidence of perjury,\u201d a finding that can be reversed only if clearly erroneous. <em>U. S. v. Rhodes, </em>569 F.2d 384, 389 (CA5, 1978); <em>U. S. v. Bagley, </em>537 F.2d 162, 166 (CA5, 1976), <em>cert. denied, </em>429 U.S. 1075, 97 S.Ct. 816, 50 L.Ed.2d 794 (1977). Our review of Derry\u2019s grand jury testimony supports the district court\u2019s conclusion. Absent a finding that perjury was committed, there is no basis for dismissing the indictment. <em>U. S. v. Sullivan, </em>578 F.2d 121, 124 (CA5, 1978); <em>U. S. v. Guillette, </em>547 F.2d 743, 753 (CA2), <em>cert. denied, </em>434 U.S. 839, 98 S.Ct. 132, 54 L.Ed.2d 102 (1977).</p>\n<p id=\"b346-11\">Appellant\u2019s <em>Basurto </em>argument fails in a second respect. In the sense that they were about collateral matters, Derry\u2019s alleged misstatements were not material. The statements in question revolve around the agent\u2019s testimony concerning a recorded interview he had conducted with Cathey.<footnotemark>5</footnotemark> Derry testified that the defendant\u2019s \u201conly explanation\u201d why his bank accounts \u201cfar exceeded his gross income from all known sources\u201d was that he had accumulated a large sum of money from dealing in currency exchange while stationed with the Air Force in Turkey. The transcript of the interview indicates that Cathey presented several explanations for the accumulated money in his bank accounts. Defendant claims that the statement limiting his explanation to currency dealings was material because in a tax fraud case based on net worth computations<footnotemark>6</footnotemark> the government must investigate and negate taxpayer explana<page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"273\">*273</page-number>tions for cash on hand at the beginning of the computation period in order to establish a definite opening net worth, <em>see Holland v. U. S., </em>348 U.S. 121, 132-36, 75 S.Ct. 127, 133-36, 99 L.Ed. 150, 162-65 (1954); <em>U. S. v. Hiett, </em>581 F.2d 1199, 1201 (CA5, 1978), and revealing that he gave several explanations might have brought to light that the government had not investigated all leads. Assuming that the <em>Holland </em>rule for net worth computation trials is applicable to the government\u2019s presentation of its case to the grand jury, the government\u2019s case against Cathey was computed on the premise that at the beginning of the government\u2019s computation period he had on hand the $55,000 cash hoard he claimed to have. The \u201cone explanation\u201d statement was, therefore, not material to the government\u2019s net worth computations.<footnotemark>7</footnotemark></p>\n<p id=\"b347-5\">The second statement made by agent Derry that may have been misleading, because it was unresponsive, was in answer to a grand juror\u2019s question concerning the defendant\u2019s prior military conviction.</p>\n<blockquote id=\"b347-6\">Juror: Was that for the currency dealings he was convicted?</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b347-7\">Witness: He had several things going, currency exchange was part of it.</blockquote>\n<p id=\"A2Y\">The government concedes that the defendant was not convicted for <em>currency </em>exchange violations but rather <em>military post-exchange </em>violations. We conclude, however, that the above statement is not material to an element of a \u00a7 7201 offense. Cathey argues that this statement combined with the first statement leaves the impression that he created the currency exchange lead for the cash hoard because it is a difficult source to investigate and refute. This is too strained an interpretation of the evidence.</p>\n<p id=\"b347-9\">The final statement in question occurred while Derry was testifying about Cathey\u2019s military career. He testified that he asked the defendant whether he was retired from the Air Force and recounted that Cathey said \u201cNo\u201d. In fact, Derry had asked the defendant whether he was retired from the Army. A \u201cno\u201d response to the Army question by the defendant was truthful, while a \u201cno\u201d response to the Air Force question was misleading. According to defendant, the grand jury may have inferred that he was trying to lead Derry away from discovery of his court-martial. Assuming that such an inference was drawn by the grand jury, it was not material to an element of the offense. Moreover, because Cathey concedes that the grand jury was entitled to be informed of his court-martial, any increased prejudice caused by the manner of informing the grand jury must be slight and certainly not of constitutional proportions.</p>\n<p id=\"b347-10\">Thus we agree with the district court\u2019s conclusion that dismissal of the indictment is not justified, because perjury was not proved and because the statements lacked materiality to the offense. But the presentation of the case to the grand jury is hardly commendable. Why the prosecutor elected to use Derry\u2019s hearsay account of his interview with Cathey rather than use the verbatim transcript of the interview we do not know. <em>See </em>note 5, <em>supra. </em>Use of the transcript would have avoided the problems discussed in this portion of our opinion.</p>\n<p id=\"b347-11\">B. <em>Improper remark</em></p>\n<p id=\"b347-12\">During the course of his grand jury testimony, Derry remarked that the defendant was \u201ccaught with his hand in the cookie jar.\u201d Inflammatory remarks made by a prosecutor justify the dismissal of an <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"274\">*274</page-number>indictment if the improper remarks so biased the grand jurors that their votes were based on their bias. <em>U. S. v. Polizzi, </em>500 F.2d 856, 887-88 (CA9, 1974), <em>cert. denied, </em>419 U.S. 1120, 95 S.Ct. 802, 42 L.Ed.2d 820 (1975); <em>U. S. v. Bruzgo, </em>373 F.2d 383, 386-87 (CA3,1969).<footnotemark>8</footnotemark> We agree with the district court that the remark was needless and improper. We also agree with the district court that the remark does not rise to constitutional proportions.</p>\n<p id=\"b348-4\">II. Jencks Act material</p>\n<p id=\"b348-5\">Agent Derry testified at the trial. After he testified defendant\u2019s counsel requested all Jencks Act material. 18 U.S.C. \u00a7 3500. The government submitted Derry\u2019s reports to the district judge for <em>in camera </em>inspection. The district judge ordered production with the deletion of several portions of the report. The clearly erroneous standard of review applies to district court determinations of what material must be produced under the Jencks Act. <em>U. S. v. Beasley, </em>519 F.2d 233 (CA5, 1975); <em>U. S. v. Graves, </em>428 F.2d 196, 200 (CA5, 1970). We have examined the deleted portions of Derry\u2019s report and conclude that no error was committed in not ordering their production.</p>\n<p id=\"b348-10\">III. Admission of 16-year-old military conviction</p>\n<p id=\"b348-11\">The defendant testified, and on cross-examination the prosecution impeached his credibility by eliciting the fact of his prior military conviction for larceny.<footnotemark>9</footnotemark> The defendant has raised several objections to this use of his prior military conviction.<footnotemark>10</footnotemark> Because we conclude that under Fed.R.Evid. 609(b) the trial judge abused his discretion in admitting Cathey\u2019s 16-year-old conviction,<footnotemark>11</footnotemark> we do not reach his other objections.</p>\n<p id=\"b348-12\">While stationed in Turkey, Cathey was convicted by general court-martial of five specifications of theft of Air Force Exchange merchandise.<footnotemark>12</footnotemark> He was sentenced to two years hard labor, was released from military confinement June 31, 1961, and called to testify in October 1977. The prior conviction was therefore a little more than 16 years old when offered into evidence as measured by the standards of Rule 609(b). <em>See U. S. v. Cohen, </em>544 F.2d 781, 784 (CA5), <em>cert. denied, </em>431 U.S. 914, 97 S.Ct. 2175, 53 L.Ed.2d 224 (1977).<footnotemark>13</footnotemark> Accordingly Rule 609(b)\u2019s standard of admissibility for convictions over 10 years old applies:</p>\n<blockquote id=\"ABh\">Evidence of a conviction under this rule is not admissible if a period of more than <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"275\">*275</page-number>ten years has elapsed . . . unless the court determines, in the interests of justice, that the probative value of the conviction supported by specific facts and circumstances substantially outweighs its prejudicial effect.</blockquote>\n<p id=\"b349-6\">As originally presented to Congress, Rule 609(b) made inadmissible all convictions over 10 years old. Although Congress amended the Rule to allow for the use of prior convictions over 10 years old in some circumstances, the legislative history makes clear that \u201cconvictions over 10 years old will be admitted very rarely and only in exceptional circumstances.\u201d Sen.Rep. No. 1277, 93d Cong. 2d Sess. 4, <em>reprinted in </em>1974 U.S.Code Cong. &amp; Admin.News pp. 7051, 7062. Rule 609(b) must be interpreted in light of the gloss Congress placed on the Rule\u2019s standard of admissibility. We conclude that by use of the term exceptional circumstances Congress intended the courts to take account of the need for using a prior conviction as an essential element of the probative value \u2014 prejudicial effect balancing test mandated by Rule 609(b). The exceptional circumstances idea expressed in the legislative history responds to the \u201cinterests of justice\u201d language of Rule 609(b).<footnotemark>14</footnotemark></p>\n<p id=\"b349-7\">Before analyzing the factors that go into the balancing of the probative value against the prejudicial effect of a prior conviction under 609(b), we emphasize this court\u2019s conclusion in <em>Milis v. Estelle, </em>552 F.2d 119, 120 (CA5), <em>cert. denied, </em>434 U.S. 871, 89 S.Ct. 214, 54 L.Ed.2d 149 (1977),'that 609(b) establishes a presumption against the use of more than 10-year-old convictions. The court\u2019s conclusion is supported by both the language of the Rule as well as the legislative history. Rule 609(b) makes overage convictions inadmissible unless the court makes the required finding of probative value. The general rule, therefore, is inadmissibility. Moreover, in the Senate Report on the Rules of Evidence, the Senate noted that \u201cconvictions over ten years old generally do not have much probative value.\u201d Sen.Rep. No. 1277, 93d Cong. 2d Sess. 4, <em>reprinted in </em>1974 U.S.Code Cong. &amp; Admin.News pp. 7051, 7061. The presumption against admissibility is, therefore, founded on a legislative perception that the passage of time dissipates the probative value of a prior conviction. <em>Cf. U. S. v. Beechum, </em>582 F.2d 898, 915 (CA5, 1978) (en banc) (Under Rule 404 \u201ctemporal remoteness depreciates the probity of the extrinsic offense\u201d). The balancing scale Congress has given the courts is weighted against a finding that the probative value of a more than 10-year-old conviction substantially outweighs its prejudicial effect. Therefore, as this court stated in <em>U. S. v. Bibbs, </em>564 F.2d 1165 (CA5, <em>1977), cert. denied, </em>435 U.S. 1007, 98 S.Ct. 1877, 56 L.Ed.2d 388 (1978), \u201cCongress intended that trial judges be extremely cautious in admitting evidence of remote convictions.\u201d <em>Id. </em>at 1170.</p>\n<p id=\"b349-10\">The prior convictions of a witness may only be used by the jury to evaluate the witness\u2019s credibility. In spite of the legal rule limiting the use of prior conviction evidence to impeachment purposes, when the witness is the accused the evidence is subject to improper use. <em>U. S. v. Martinez, </em>555 F.2d 1273, 1275 (CA5, 1977) (quoting <em>U. S. v. Garber, </em>471 F.2d 212, 215 (CA5, 1972)); see <em>Mills v. Estelle, supra </em>at 120. The jury may misuse the evidence by considering the defendant a person of criminal tendencies and, therefore, more likely to have committed the crime for which he is being tried, <em>Mills v. Estelle, supra </em>at 120, or if the prior conviction is similar to the new charges, the jury may misuse the prior conviction as evidence of guilt, <em>U. S. </em>v. <em>Martinez, supra </em>at 1275, or the jury may just be more willing to convict a person who already has been convicted for a different crime, <em>Mills v. Estelle, supra </em>at 120.<footnotemark>15</footnotemark> <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"276\">*276</page-number>When the prior conviction is for a crime distinct from the charges for which the accused is currently being tried, as in this case, the potential for jury misuse of the evidence decreases. <em>U. S. v. Poteet, </em>573 F.2d 351, 353 (CA5, 1978). Nevertheless, potential prejudice arising from the criminal tendency inference and the jury\u2019s willingness to convict an already once convicted person remains quite real.</p>\n<p id=\"b350-4\">We now turn to the probative value portion of Rule 609(b)\u2019s equation. The probative value of a prior conviction is a function of at least two factors, the nature of the past crime and the remoteness of the conviction. Crimes involving dishonesty or false statement are often more probative of the witness\u2019s lack of credibility than even more serious crimes involving violence. Rule 609(a) incorporates this distinction between types of crimes. Whether this defendant\u2019s military conviction was for a crime involving dishonesty or false statement is a matter of dispute between the parties.<footnotemark>16</footnotemark> On the view we take of this case, it is not necessary to resolve this dispute. Assuming that the military conviction was for a crime involving dishonesty, that is insufficient justification, by itself, for use of the prior conviction. The presumption against the use of an over-age conviction is not so weak that it falls before a finding that the prior conviction was for a crime involving dishonesty. Judge Tuttle in <em>Mills v. Estelle, supra, </em>noted that Rule 609(b)\u2019s 10-year limit on prior convictions \u201ccould be conceptualized as a policy statement that if an offender keeps his record unblemished for ten years, he will be presumed to be as truthful as a normal citizen, i. e., that the ten-year period is evidence that the inference supporting use of prior crime impeachment evidence (a lawbreaker is likely to lie) can no longer be drawn about a certain person.\u201d <em>Id. </em>at 120. A crime involving dishonesty is more likely to overcome Rule 609(b)\u2019s presumption, but more than that bare conclusion must be shown.</p>\n<p id=\"b350-8\">In <em>U. S. v. Cohen, supra, </em>we held that the district judge did not abuse his discretion when he allowed the prosecution to impeach the defendant with a 13-year-old conviction for mail fraud. <em>Id. </em>at 785. However, in <em>U. S. v. Bibbs, supra </em>at 1170, decided after <em>Cohen, </em>we recognized as an essential element of Rule 609(b) the necessity of showing exceptional circumstances justifying the use of an over-age prior conviction. Exceptional circumstances were not shown in the instant case.<footnotemark>17</footnotemark></p>\n<p id=\"b350-9\">In the context of admissibility of over-age convictions exceptional circumstances includes, though it is not limited to, the need of the party offering the evidence to use it. This concept of necessity is relevant to the district judge\u2019s evaluation of the probative value of the conviction. Our <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"277\">*277</page-number>recent en banc decision in <em>Beechum, </em>interpreting Fed.R.Evid. 404, provides us with guidance. Rule 404 like 609(b) calls on the judge to balance the probative value of the proffered evidence against its prejudicial effect.<footnotemark>18</footnotemark> In <em>Beechum, </em>the court stated that</p>\n<blockquote id=\"AVS\">Probity in this context is not an absolute; its value must be determined with regard to the extent to which the defendant\u2019s unlawful intent is established by other evidence, stipulation, or inference. It is the incremental probity of the evidence that is to be balanced against its potential for undue prejudice. Thus, if the Government has a strong case on the intent issue, the extrinsic offense may add little and consequently will be excluded more readily.</blockquote>\n<p id=\"b351-5\"><em>Id. </em>at 914 (footnote and citations omitted). Therefore, when a party wishes to use an over-age conviction, the trial judge must consider whether the witness already has been impeached, and if so, the probative value of the prior conviction decreases accordingly.</p>\n<p id=\"b351-6\">In this case nothing suggests exceptional circumstances justifying the use of Cathey\u2019s prior conviction. The defendant\u2019s credibility had already been well impeached by the government\u2019s cross-examination during which he had been caught in various contradictions and numerous misstatements. There was little need to add the icing of his military conviction. The district court mentioned that on direct examination Cathey had testified to his accumulation of a cash hoard during his military career, and, of course, the court-martial for stealing occurred during his military service. Possibly the court considered the conviction as bearing on the credibility of defendant\u2019s claim that he had accumulated a cash hoard. If anything, the conviction of stealing at the time Cathey claimed he was accumulating his cash hoard, bolsters his credibility with respect to a hoard rather than impeaches it. Absent some additional factor justifying the use of the prior conviction, there is no basis for concluding that it falls within the exceptional circumstances caveat to the general prohibition against the use of a conviction more than 10 years old.</p>\n<p id=\"b351-12\">The government says the error was harmless. We cannot say that it did not influence the jury or that it had very slight effect. <em>Kotteakos v. U. S., </em>328 U.S. 750, 66 S.Ct. 1239, 90 L.Ed. 1557 (1946). The government argues that Cathey already had been caught in so many falsehoods on cross-examination that the additional blow could not have hurt. We agree that he had been well impeached, and, because he had, there was no need for the prosecution to use the 16-year-old conviction. The right to use evidence of prior convictions to impeach is tempered by the need to use it. It would be anomalous indeed to conclude that the less the prosecutor needs the evidence the freer he is to use it.</p>\n<p id=\"b351-13\">REVERSED.</p>\n<footnote label=\"1\">\n<p id=\"b345-14\">. Under Fed.R.Crim.P. 12(b)(2) motions to dismiss an indictment must be made before trial or they are waived. Rule 12(f), however, excuses for good cause failure to move for dismissal prior to trial. Because defendant did not receive a transcript of Derry\u2019s grand jury testimony until after the trial began, he could not be expected to comply with Rule 12(b)(2). Cathey made his motion at the earliest possible time. We conclude that it was timely under 12(f). <em>U. S. v. Kaplan, </em>554 F.2d 958, 970 n.7 (CA9), <em>cert. denied, </em>434 U.S. 956, 98 S.Ct. 483, 54 L.Ed.2d 315 (1977).</p>\n</footnote>\n<footnote label=\"2\">\n<p id=\"b346-4\">.

Cathey seems to question the validity of the government\u2019s presentation of this evidence to the grand jury through Derry\u2019s testimony, rather than presenting the transcript of the interview, which was available at the time of the grand jury proceedings. While it may be preferable in such situations to present the transcript rather than the hearsay evidence, it is clear that an indictment based on hearsay is not constitutionally invalid. <em>Costello v.

The court stated that</p>\n<blockquote id=\"b346-14\">\u201cTo establish unreported income under the net worth method, the government must establish the taxpayer\u2019s net worth at the beginning of the tax year in question. Then the government must establish the taxpayer\u2019s net worth at the close of the year. It subtracts the former figure from the latter to show the taxpayer\u2019s increase in net worth for the year in question. This figure is further adjusted by (1) adding to it the taxpayer\u2019s non-deductible personal expenditures for the year and (2) subtracting from it the taxpayer\u2019s allowable deductions.\u201d</blockquote>\n<p id=\"b346-15\"><em>Id. </em>at 1200 n.1.</p>\n</footnote>\n<footnote label=\"7\">\n<p id=\"b347-8\">. In his reply brief, Cathey claims that the government\u2019s failure to provide the grand jury with all of his explanations for his cash hoard was relevant to the issue of willful evasion of taxes, a necessary element of a \u00a7 7201 violation. <em>See U. S. </em>v. <em>Hiett, supra </em>at 1200. He points to other testimony concerning his cash hoard to support his argument that the cash hoard testimony was used by the government to prove willfulness. Defendant, however, does not contend, nor is there any indication that the agent\u2019s testimony, other than the failure to give all of Cathey\u2019s explanations for the cash hoard, was erroneous. In such a case the false statement concerning the sources of a taxpayer\u2019s cash hoard is not material to the willfulness element of a \u00a7 7201 offense.</p>\n</footnote>\n<footnote label=\"8\">\n<p id=\"b348-6\">. We assume for purposes of this case that inflammatory remarks made by an agent of the government, though not the prosecutor, can, if sufficiently grievous, justify the dismissal of an indictment.</p>\n</footnote>\n<footnote label=\"9\">\n<p id=\"b348-7\">. The prosecution gave the defense advance notice of intent to use the prior conviction in the event defendant testified, as required by Fed.R.Evid. 609(b). <em>U. S. v. Bibbs, </em>564 F.2d 1165, 1170 n.3 (CA5, 1977), <em>cert. denied, </em>435 U.S. 1007, 98 S.Ct. 1877, 56 L.Ed.2d 388 (1978).</p>\n</footnote>\n<footnote label=\"10\">\n<p id=\"b348-8\">. The objections not reached in this opinion are: (1) a court-martial conviction is not a crime within the meaning of Rule 609; (2) admission of a court-martial conviction violates the defendant\u2019s right to trial by jury; (3) larceny is not a crime involving dishonesty; and (4) the district judge failed to specifically find that the probative value of the conviction substantially outweighed the prejudicial effect.</p>\n</footnote>\n<footnote label=\"11\">\n<p id=\"b348-9\">. The standard of review for admission of evidence questions is abuse of discretion. <em>U. S. v. Cohen, </em>544 F.2d 781, 784-85 (CA5), <em>cert. denied, </em>431 U.S. 914, 97 S.Ct. 2175, 53 L.Ed.2d 224 (1977).</p>\n</footnote>\n<footnote label=\"12\">\n<p id=\"b348-13\">. He was also convicted of violating a military regulation, but the district court allowed only the use of the theft convictions, concluding that a conviction for violation of military discipline is inadmissible. This is in accord with the weight of authority. <em>U. S. v. Tomaiolo, </em>249 F.2d 683, 693 (CA2, 1975); 2 Torc\u00eda, Wharton\u2019s Criminal Evidence \u00a7 475, at 436-37 (13th ed. 1973).</p>\n</footnote>\n<footnote label=\"13\">\n<p id=\"b348-14\">. In <em>Cohen </em>we computed the age of the prior conviction from the time of the defendant\u2019s release from prison to the commencement of the trial. We see no reason to suggest departing from that approach, except to add a caveat that since the concern is the defendant\u2019s credibility when he testifies the correct point from which to measure backwards in time may be the date when he testifies rather than the date when the trial commences, which in a protracted trial might be considerably earlier. We have some doubt that <em>Cohen </em>intended to focus upon this difference.</p>\n</footnote>\n<footnote label=\"14\">\n<p id=\"b349-8\">. The other possible interpretation of the legislative history is that Congress was prophesying that as an empirical matter courts will rarely conclude that the probative value of an over-age conviction substantially outweighs its prejudicial effect. This interpretation accounts for the \u201cvery rarely\u201d language of the passage, but leaves unexplained what the \u201cexceptional circumstances\u201d are that justify the use of an over-age conviction.</p>\n</footnote>\n<footnote label=\"15\">\n<p id=\"b349-12\">. In light of the potential for misusing prior conviction evidence, the <em>Martinez </em>court concluded that \u201cthe danger of unfair prejudice is <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"276\">*276</page-number>far greater when the accused, as opposed to other witnesses, testifies, because the jury may be prejudiced not merely on the question of credibility but also on the ultimate question of guilt or innocence.\u201d <em>Id. </em>at 1275.</p>\n</footnote>\n<footnote label=\"16\">\n<p id=\"b350-6\">. Cathey contends that his military conviction was for petit larceny and that petit larceny is not a crime involving dishonesty. This court stated in <em>U. S. v. Carden, </em>529 F.2d 443, 446 (CA5, 1976), <em>cert. denied, </em>429 U.S. 848, 97 S.Ct. 134, 50 L.Ed.2d 121 (1977), that petit larceny involves dishonesty. This dictum was retracted in <em>U. S. v. Ashley, </em>569 F.2d 975 (CA5, 1978), in which we concluded \u201cthat a conviction for shoplifting is not a conviction involving dishonesty or false statement within the meaning of Fed.R.Evid. 609(a).\u201d <em>Id. </em>at 979. The cases relied upon by the court in <em>Ashley </em>recognize that certain crimes that are classified as petit larceny involve dishonesty or false statement and that it is necessary to look at the basis of the conviction to determine whether the crime involved dishonesty rather than merely categorize the offense. <em>See, e. g., U. S. v. Papia, </em>560 F.2d 827, 846\u201447 (CA7, 1977); <em>U. S. v. Hayes, </em>553 F.2d 824, 827 (CA2), <em>cert. denied, </em>434 U.S. 867, 98 S.Ct. 204, 54 L.Ed.2d 143 (1977) (quoting <em>U. S. v. Smith, </em>179 U.S.App.D.C. 162, 178, n.28, 551 F.2d 348, 364 n.28 (1976)). <em>See also U.

A second decision bearing on the admissibility of over-age convictions decided after <em>Cohen </em>is <em>Mills v. Estelle, supra, </em>where we concluded that 609(b) creates a presumption against their admissibility. There is no indication that the <em>Cohen </em>court took this consideration into account.</p>\n</footnote>\n<footnote label=\"18\">\n<p id=\"b351-7\">. The balancing test mandated by the two rules is different in one important respect. Under Rule 403, the court may exclude Rule 404 evidence \u201cif its probative value is <em>substantially outweighed </em>by the danger of unfair prejudice Fed.R.Evid. 403. Under Rule 609(b), on the other hand, an over-age conviction is admissible only if the conviction\u2019s \u201cprobative value . . . <em>substantially outweighs </em>its prejudicial effect.\u201d The test in Rule 609(b) is the mirror image of the test under Rule 403.</p>\n</footnote>\n</opinion>\n<opinion data-order=\"8\" data-type=\"opinion\" id=\"x999-2\" type=\"dissent\">\n<author id=\"b351-14\">FAY, Circuit Judge,</author>\n<p id=\"AYi\">dissenting:</p>\n<p id=\"b351-15\">This is a weak dissent in a very close case.<footnotemark>1</footnotemark> I agree wholeheartedly with Parts I and II of the majority opinion.

Paraphrasing my brother\u2019s dissent in <em>United States v. McCain, </em>556 F.2d 253, 256 (5th Cir. 1977) (Judge Gee dissenting).</p>\n</footnote>\n<footnote label=\"2\">\n<p id=\"b351-16\">. In computing the ten year period prescribed in Rule 609, it appears we are bound by the panel opinion in <em>United States v. Cohen, </em>544 F.2d 781 (5th Cir. 1977) unless and until modified by the en banc court. The rule is stated as being that period running from the date of conviction or release from confinement, whichever is later, to the commencement of trial. If writing on a clean slate, it seems to me the most appropriate closing date would be that of the next succeeding alleged offense rather than commencement of trial. Any other formula serves to reward the felon for delaying prosecution by any means possible. If prior convic<page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"278\">*278</page-number>tions lose their probative value for impeachment purposes because of ten years of \u201cgood behavior\u201d, that is the period we should measure \u2014 the period of unquestioned good behavior.</p>\n</footnote>\n</opinion>\n</casebody>\n",
