The lower court, after a trial, found that Valdez did not establish a prima facie case of racial discrimination. Assuming arguendo a prima facie case, the trial court also found the defendant had rebutted it by showing legitimate nondiscriminatory reasons for its treatment of Valdez.</p>\n<p id=\"b83-24\">Valdez appeals the judgment arguing that the lower court was clearly erroneous in several of its findings. However, Valdez presents no evidence for his proposition. In fact, Valdez has failed to file a transcript or alternate statement of evidence, as required by Rules 10(b) and 10(c), F.R.A.P. In addition, Valdez petitions this court to subpoena certain of defendant\u2019s records. However, as a reviewing court we are not authorized to conduct a second round of discovery and hearings. Valdez also argues that two of the courts findings, Finding No. 17 and Finding No. 18, are contradictory.<footnotemark>1</footnotemark> We disagree.</p>\n<p id=\"b84-3\"><page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"10\">*10</page-number>For the foregoing reasons we affirm the judgment of the trial court and dismiss the appeal.</p>\n<p id=\"b84-4\">AFFIRMED.</p>\n<footnote label=\"1\">\n<p id=\"b83-15\">. Finding No. 17 reads: \u201cMr. Lindley testified that it was his considered judgment up to the time he fired Mr. Valdez that plaintiffs work had never reached the level necessary to justify his taking the vertical weld test.\u201d</p>\n<p id=\"b83-26\">Finding No. 18 reads: \u201cThere is no evidence that defendant in any way harassed Mr. Valdez, or that they refused to let him take the advanced test or fired him for racial reasons.\u201d</p>\n</footnote>\n</opinion>\n</casebody>\n",
