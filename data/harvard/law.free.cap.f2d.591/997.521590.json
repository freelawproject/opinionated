BRYAN, Senior Circuit Judge:</author>\n<p id=\"b1072-5\">Obedient to the remittitur of the Supreme Court in vacating our judgment,<footnotemark>1</footnotemark> this court has given the case \u201cfurther consideration in light of <em>Regents of [the] University of California v. Bakke, </em>438 U.S. 265 [98 S.Ct. 2733, 57 L.Ed.2d 750] (1978).\u201d<footnotemark>2</footnotemark> To be reexamined is the conclusion of invalidity laid, in the suit of appellant-white students, to two of the regulations and practices approved and effectuated by the University of North Carolina in its student government.</p>\n<p id=\"b1072-6\">The first regulation in issue pertains to the legislative branch, the Campus Governing Council (CGC), elected annually by the student body. The CGC is composed of 18 members, but must include \u201cat least two Councillors of a minority race within the Student Body (if any), two male Councillors and two female Councillors.\u201d<footnotemark>3</footnotemark> If the election does not satisfy this contingency, then the President of the Council (the president of the student body) shall make appointments from the students generally to fulfill this requisite.</p>\n<p id=\"b1072-7\">The second questioned requirement relates to the composition of the judicial branch of the government, the Honor Court of the Student Body. Abbreviated, this latter provision stipulates that an accused, on request, is entitled to have four of the seven judges of the court of his or her race or sex.<footnotemark>4</footnotemark></p>\n<p id=\"b1072-16\">Appellants charge that these regulations and practices, in relying <em>exclusively </em>on a racial criterion, deny them their Fourteenth Amendment rights of equal protection, and violate the Civil Rights Act of 1871 and Title VI of the Civil Rights Act of 1964.<footnotemark>5</footnotemark></p>\n<p id=\"b1072-17\"><em>Bakke, </em>we recognize, unequivocally pronounces that in State educational institutions race may be <em>a </em>consideration in fixing the rights of students, but at no stage did the Court affirm that race could be the sole determinant in any such adjustment. 438 U.S. 265, 98 S.Ct. 2733. As Mr. Justice Powell put it for the majority:</p>\n<blockquote id=\"b1072-18\">When a classification denies an individual opportunities or benefits enjoyed by others <em>solely </em>because of his race or ethnic background, it must be regarded as suspect. (Accent added.)</blockquote>\n<p id=\"b1072-19\"><em>Id. </em>at 305, 98 S.Ct. at 2756.</p>\n<p id=\"b1072-20\">I.</p>\n<p id=\"b1072-21\">The permeating defect in the organization of CGC, the governing council, is the imposition of an artificial racial structure upon this elective body that bars non-minority students from eligibility for appointment to the Council. This resort to race affronts <em>Bakke. </em>Although the regulation in question seeks to provide \u201cprotective representation,\u201d its effect is to establish a racial classification, as it relies exclusively on race to preclude non-minority students from enjoying opportunities and benefits available to others. <em>See id. </em>265, 98 S.Ct. 2733.</p>\n<p id=\"b1073-4\"><page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"999\">*999</page-number>Aggravation of the incursion upon appellant-white students\u2019 rights becomes immediately apparent upon recalling that the CGC President picks additional minority students to satisfy the requisite racial composition without an election. Appellants are ineligible for appointment to the Council because they are not of a minority race. Furthermore, the presence of one or more unelected members on the Council dilutes the representative character of the legislative body. Students are entitled to the assurance that their legislature, established at a State institution, is entirely free from the taint of racial preference. Disenfranchisement because of race entrenches upon their Constitutional and statutory rights. <em>Supra </em>note 5.</p>\n<p id=\"b1073-5\">In <em>Bakke, </em>Justice Powell reiterated \u201cthat in \u2018order to justify the use of a suspect classification, a State must show that its purpose or interest is both constitutionally permissible and substantial, and that its use of the classification is \u201cnecessary . to the accomplishment\u201d of its purpose or the safeguarding of its interest.\u2019 \u201d (Citations omitted.) 438 U.S. at 305, 98 S.Ct. at 2756. Inclusion in the CGC of unelected Councillors is not indispensable to assure representation of minority students. As noted in <em>Bakke:</em></p>\n<blockquote id=\"b1073-6\">Nothing in the Constitution supports the notion that individuals may be asked to suffer otherwise impermissible burdens in order to enhance the societal standing of their ethnic groups. . . . [Preferential programs may only reinforce common stereotypes holding that certain groups are unable to achieve success without special protection based on a factor having no relationship to individual worth.</blockquote>\n<p id=\"b1073-8\"><em>Id. </em>at 298, 98 S.Ct. at 2753.</p>\n<p id=\"b1073-9\">II.</p>\n<p id=\"b1073-10\">The Honor Court is, of course, for the trial of students accused of conduct dishonorable or otherwise hurtful to the student body, as well as to other pupils individually. It is in the nature of an intramural judicial tribunal of seven lay jurors or judges. Its organic regulation allows race to be a dominant consideration in impaneling the court, obviously a vital juncture in the trial process. This focus on race is achieved by permitting the defendant to insist that a majority of his triers be of his race. That such recourse to race would be a preposterous defiance of the Fourteenth Amendment and the Civil Rights Acts, <em>supra </em>note 5, in a trial beyond the University walls needs no exposition. Its denial of equal protection within the academic community is no less clear, for there race may be invoked in a trial adjudging the character of a student.</p>\n<p id=\"b1073-12\">Extending the choice of his judges\u2019 racial complexion to a student on trial for misconduct is a potential invasion both of the rights of the other students singly and as a body. They need the protection afforded by the court to prevent any injury to them which the particular defendant\u2019s offense might cause. The non-offenders\u2019 confidence in the Honor Court logically is diminished when they know that by regulation race may influence the court\u2019s judgment. Their position can be likened to the public\u2019s in a criminal prosecution, where the prosecution, like the defendant, is entitled to a jury not drawn with an eye to race.</p>\n<p id=\"b1073-13\">The stern, sincere and unanimous desire for fairness, both in truth and in theory, cannot override the stubborn fact that the system adopted by the University perpetuates inequity instead, thus infringing upon the interests of all students. The just solution is to remove race altogether from the high court regulation, as the appellants pray. Otherwise, it will bar them of the assurances of equal treatment under the Constitution and laws of the United States. <em>Supra </em>note 5.</p>\n<p id=\"b1073-14\">III.</p>\n<p id=\"b1073-15\">There is no justification for appellees\u2019 insistence that the cause be remanded to the District Court to take additional evidence that, they assert, reflects prior discrimination at the University, or depicts the regulations as an effort by the University to develop a \u201cdiverse student body\u201d or to <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"1000\">*1000</page-number>achieve other related aims. <em>Bakke </em>suggests that racial preferences may be approved upon the finding of a continuing Constitutional or statutory violation, as long as others are not prejudiced by the remedial course adopted. 438 U.S. 265, 98 S.Ct. 2733. The method here chosen for eradicating possible earlier discrimination could not be accepted, even if history revealed such conduct, because, as we have seen, the supposedly remedial measures presently enforced impinge upon the rights of others.</p>\n<p id=\"b1074-4\">\n<em>Conclusion</em>\n</p>\n<p id=\"b1074-5\">Finally, the University of North Carolina has failed to demonstrate that the accomplishment of the State\u2019s purpose necessitates its use of a suspect classification in the two student government regulations before us. Accordingly, summary judgment will go for the appellants, holding the regulations invalid, and, to that extent, reversing the judgment of the District Court.</p>\n<p id=\"b1074-6\">Reversed with Summary Judgment.</p>\n<footnote label=\"1\">\n<p id=\"b1072-8\">. <em>Uzzell v.

Bakke, </em>438 U.S. 265, 98 S.Ct. 2733, 57 L.Ed.2d 750 (1978), requires a remand to the district court for the taking of evidence and for findings of fact, we respectfully dissent. Additionally, we think that on remand the district court should make a determination as to whether the case is moot.</p>\n<p id=\"b1074-9\">I.</p>\n<p id=\"b1074-10\">The majority, on an incomplete record as we shall show, invalidates two regulations. The first requires that the 18-member Campus Governing Council have \u201ca protective representation of minority races and both sexes by being composed of at least two members of a minority race within the student body, two male members and two female members. If, as a result of student elections, these minimum requirements are not met, the president of the student body, with the consent of the council, shall appoint additional members, who have the same rights, privileges and duties as elected members, to satisfy the formula. From the present record, it appears that it has never been necessary that the power of appointment be exercised to meet the minimum requirements of minority racial representation.</p>\n<p id=\"b1074-12\">The second is a guarantee that an accused required to appear before an Honor Court may, on his request, require that four of the seven judges of the Court be of his or her race or sex. It should be noted that this regulation is facially neutral both as to race and as to sex; the right to have a majority of the judges of the same race and sex as the accused extends to a student of either sex and of any race.</p>\n<p id=\"b1074-13\">As we pointed out in our earlier dissent, the record before us contains some general discovery by way of requests for admissions, answers to interrogatories and production of documents. 558 F.2d at 728. But these disclosures fall well short of telling the whole story of the history of discrimination or non-discrimination at the university, the need for remedial measures, the reasonableness of the measures and how, in practice, they have operated. Short of such proof and findings of fact derived therefore, we do not think that this case can be properly decided.</p>\n<p id=\"b1074-14\"><em>Bakke </em>does not hold that in all events racial criteria may not be the sole determinant in fixing the rights of students. True, <em>Bakke </em>recognizes that race is a suspect classification, but the significance of the classification is, as Mr. Justice Powell for the Court explains, only that the State, in order to sustain the validity of its use of the criterion, \u201cmust show that its purpose or interest is both constitutionally permissible and substantial, and that its use of the classification is \u2018necessary ... to the accomplishment\u2019 of its purpose or the safeguarding of its interest.\u201d 438 U.S. at 305, 98 S.Ct. at 2756 (quoting from <em>In re Griffiths, </em>413 U.S. 717, 722-23, 93 S.Ct. 2851, 37 <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"1001\">*1001</page-number>L.Ed.2d 910 (1973)). Having reaffirmed that general principle, Mr. Justice Powell added, \u201c[t]he State certainly has a legitimate and substantial interest in ameliorating, or eliminating where feasible, the disabling effects of identified discrimination.\u201d 438 U.S. at 307, 98 S.Ct. at 2757.<footnotemark>*</footnotemark> Of course, Mr. Justice Powell continued, the Court \u201chas never approved a classification that aids persons perceived as members of relatively victimized groups at the expense of other innocent individuals in the absence of judicial, legislative, or administrative findings of constitutional or statutory violations.\u201d 438 U.S. at 307, 98 S.Ct. at 2757. But, \u201c[ajfter such findings have been made, the governmental interest in preferring members of the injured groups at the expense of others is substantial since the legal rights of the victims must be vindicated.\u201d 438 U.S. at 307, 98 S.Ct. at 2758.</p>\n<p id=\"b1075-5\">Contra to the views of the majority, we read <em>Bakke </em>both to recognize and to approve, as a general principle, the use of racial criteria in remedial steps to redress wrongs worked by adjudicated instances of racial discrimination, provided only that the remedial steps \u201cwork the least harm possible to other innocent persons competing for the benefit.\u201d 438 U.S. at 308, 98 S.Ct. at 2758. That is the very reason why we think this case should be remanded and a full trial conducted. The present record simply does not permit a firm conclusion as to the extent of discrimination at the University of North Carolina and the need for and efficacy of the present regulations. The majority\u2019s condemnation of the regulations because they impinge upon the rights of others is simplistic. <em>Bakke </em>teaches that as a necessary remedial measure a victimized group may be preferred at the expense of other innocent persons. What cries out for determination in the instant case is whether such preferment is justified under the principles of <em>Bakke.</em></p>\n<p id=\"b1075-7\">II.</p>\n<p id=\"b1075-8\">This litigation began on June 13, 1974 by plaintiffs then students at the University. They were joined by other students who sought to intervene on September 13, 1974, and whose intervention was allowed. Although the complaint sought certification for a class action, the district court did not act upon the request. Additional interventions were sought from us, and on April 18, 1978, we referred the motions to the district court. The present record does not disclose what action the district court took thereon.</p>\n<p id=\"b1075-9\">The fact that even with scholastic success the period that a student is enrolled in a University is limited and the fact that, absent certification of a class, there have been repeated efforts to intervene in the litigation suggest to us the possibility that the litigation has become moot. Thus, it is quite possible that the action may have been mooted by the departure of all named plaintiffs from the University before other students sought intervention. If, in accord with our views, the case were remanded for trial on the merits, we would direct the district court first to consider if the case has become moot either because all named plaintiffs have severed their connection with the University, or at some stage of the proceedings no named plaintiff had maintained a continuing connection with the University.</p>\n<footnote label=\"*\">\n<p id=\"b1075-6\"> After the mandate of the Supreme Court issued in the instant case, the University moved for a remand to the district court for a trial on the merits. After pointing out that the present record is not full and complete, the university tracked the language quoted in the text asking that it \u201cbe afforded an opportunity to present evidence of its \u2018legitimate and substantial interest in ameliorating, or eliminating where feasible, the disabling effects of identified discrimination.\u2019 \u201d Indeed, it rightfully argued that procedural due process required that it be given this opportunity.</p>\n</footnote>\n</opinion>\n</casebody>\n",
