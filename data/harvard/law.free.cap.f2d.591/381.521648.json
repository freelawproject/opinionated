Strang, a Lutheran minister (hereinafter Strang), and his wife, Eleanor L. Strang (both parties hereinafter jointly referred to as taxpayers or appellants), to recover self-employment taxes in the amount of $307.50. Taxpayers allege the self-employment taxes were collected erroneously by the Internal Revenue Service with respect to their taxable year 1971. The district court denied relief to the taxpayers and entered judgment against them for interest in the amount of $25.91. The taxpayers appeal.</p>\n<p id=\"b455-23\">Appellant Strang was ordained a minister of the Lutheran Church in America in June 1965. During the calendar years 1965 through 1969, he had self-employment earnings of $400 or more, some part of which was derived from services performed as a minister. From July 1969 until June 1971, Strang \u201cleft\u201d the ministry and worked as an employee for private companies. Strang \u201cre-entered\u201d the ministry in June 1971. From June 1971 through December 1971, he had self-employment earnings of more than $400, some part of which he earned as a minister.</p>\n<p id=\"b455-24\">Under \u00a7 1402(e)<footnotemark>1</footnotemark> of the Internal Revenue Code, an individual first performing serv<page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"382\">*382</page-number>ices as a minister prior to or during 1968, had until April 15,1970, to file an \u201cApplication for Exemption from Self-Employment Tax for use by Ministers, Members of Religious Orders and Christian Science Practitioners,\u201d Form 4361. An individual entering the ministry after December 31, 1968, must file on or before April 15 of the year following the close of the second taxable year after entry into the ministry.</p>\n<p id=\"b456-4\">On April 10, 1973, Strang filed an application for the exemption. The application was disapproved by the District Director of Internal Revenue on May 24, 1973, on the ground that appellant\u2019s application was not timely filed and should have been filed on or before April 15, 1970.</p>\n<p id=\"b456-5\">The case was tried in the district court upon a stipulation of facts, the meaning of which is disputed by the parties. The stipulation states that \u201cin 1969 Rev. Strang left the ministry and worked for private companies as an employee until June 1971,\u201d and that \u201cin June 1971, Rev. Strang re-entered the Ministry.\u201d</p>\n<p id=\"b456-6\">Appellants contend that Strang ceased to be a minister in 1969, was not a minister on April 15, 1970, and could not have filed a truthful application as a minister on that date. They assert that when Strang \u201creentered\u201d the ministry, he was entitled to be treated as if he were a newly ordained minister, and that his application for exemption, therefore, was timely filed on April 10, 1973. The district court agreed with the Government that appellant Strang merely took a leave of absence, and, therefore, he was required under the provisions of the Act to file his application for exemption not later than April 15, 1970. The district court further held that appellant Strang had more than a year and a half in which to file an application for exemption prior to the time he \u201cleft\u201d the ministry in 1969. Appellants contend that filing was not required during this period and that appellant Strang was entitled to the full statutory time within which to file for the exemption, not merely a portion thereof.</p>\n<p id=\"b456-9\">Because of the disagreement of the parties as to the meaning of the stipulation, and the absence of any other evidence, this court is not able, on the record before us, to decide the issues raised on the appeal. The record does not reveal whether, under the practices of the Lutheran Church, an or<page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"383\">*383</page-number>dained minister can nullify or terminate his ordination at any time he chooses, and resume his status as an ordained minister at a later date. There is no evidence as to what steps, if any, appellant Strang took to terminate his status as an ordained minister when he \u201cleft the ministry\u201d in 1969. The record is silent as to whether he was ordained again when he \u201cre-entered\u201d the ministry in 1971. There is no evidence as to whether he retained the authority to perform the services of a minister from 1969 to 1971, but voluntarily refrained from exercising such prerogatives. In short, we cannot determine from the record the status of appellant Strang during the period in dispute.</p>\n<p id=\"b457-5\">Therefore, the judgment of the district court is vacated and the case is remanded to the district court for the hearing of evidence as to the status of appellant Strang during the period in question. No costs are taxed. The parties will bear their own costs on this appeal.</p>\n<footnote label=\"1\">\n<p id=\"b455-16\">.
