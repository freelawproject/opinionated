The decision and order of the Board are reported at 22 NLRB No. 63.</p>\n<p id=\"b1283-28\">Upon consideration of the record before the court and the briefs and oral arguments of counsel, the court concludes that the findings of the Board that the respondent violated Sections 8(a)(3) and (1) of the Act by discharging employee Robert Hall and laying off employees Kenneth Shaw and Doris Beachler are supported by substantial evidence. The court also concludes that the finding of the Board that <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"1210\">*1210</page-number>the respondent violated Section 8(a)(1) of the Act by coercively interrogating employees concerning their activities on behalf of the union is supported by substantial evidence on the record as a whole. However, the court concludes that the Board erred in finding that respondent violated Section 8(a)(1) of the Act by sending a letter to its employees over the signature of its president on August 8, 1975. The Court concludes that this letter constituted a communication with employees permitted under Section 8(c) of the Act.</p>\n<p id=\"b1284-4\">Since the Board\u2019s Order made no reference to the letter of August 8, 1975 and its decision on all other issues covered by the Order is supported by substantial evidence, enforcement of the Order is hereby granted.</p>\n</opinion>\n</casebody>\n",
