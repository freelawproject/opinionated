In a well reasoned opinion, setting forth in detail the <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"1266\">*1266</page-number>undisputed facts and applicable law, the district court held that the Secretary\u2019s action was committed to agency discretion and therefore was not subject to judicial review. <em>Nelson et al. v. Kleppe et al., </em>457 F.Supp. 5 (D.Idaho 1976).</p>\n<p id=\"b1340-4\">The district court concluded that there was \u201cno law to apply\u201d and judicial review was precluded by the decision of the Supreme Court in <em>Citizens to Preserve Overton Park v. Volpe, </em>401 U.S. 402, 91 S.Ct. 814, 28 L.Ed.2d 136 (1971), as interpreted by this court in <em>Ness Investment Corp. v. United States Department of Agr., Forest Service, </em>512 F.2d 706 (9 Cir. 1975), and <em>Strickland v. Morton, </em>519 F.2d 467 (9 Cir. 1975).</p>\n<p id=\"b1340-5\">Appellants contended further in the district court, as they do here, that the agency violated its own policy and that actions inconsistent with the agency policy are judicially reviewable as an abuse of discretion. Relying upon <em>Pacific Gas &amp; Electric Co. v. Federal Power Commission, </em>164 U.S.App.D.C. 371, 506 F.2d 33 (1974), the district court concluded that the policy determination in question was not the same as an administrative regulation which has the force and effect of law; that the policy decision was not statutorily required; and that the decisions involved matters best directed to the Secretary\u2019s discretion and expertise.</p>\n<p id=\"b1340-6\">Subsequent to the decision of the district court, this court has reaffirmed the holdings in <em>Ness, supra, </em>and <em>Strickland, supra, </em>in <em>Arizona Power Authority v. Morton, </em>549 F.2d 1231 (9 Cir.) <em>cert. denied, </em>434 U.S. 835, 98 S.Ct. 124, 54 L.Ed.2d 97 (1977), and <em>City of Santa Clara, California v. Andrus, </em>572 F.2d 660 (9 Cir. 1978). In <em>City of Santa Clara, </em>we concluded that \u201cif, however, no law fetters the exercise of administrative discretion, the courts have no standard against which to measure the lawfulness of agency action\u201d and that, \u201cThere is Taw to apply,\u2019 only if a specific statute limits the agency\u2019s discretion to act in the manner which is challenged.\u201d 572 F.2d at 666.</p>\n<p id=\"b1340-7\">We agree with the conclusions of the district court and adopt Judge Anderson\u2019s opinion as the opinion of this court, supplemented by the cases cited herein decided subsequent to his opinion.</p>\n<p id=\"b1340-9\">AFFIRMED.</p>\n</opinion>\n</casebody>\n",
