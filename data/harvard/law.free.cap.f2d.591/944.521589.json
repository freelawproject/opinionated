The district court granted the government defendants\u2019 motion to dismiss the plaintiffs\u2019 action on the ground that passage of the Materials Act rendered it moot. <em>Nixon v. Sampson, </em>437 F.Supp. 654, 656 (D.D.C.1977). We reverse and remand for proceedings not inconsistent with this opinion.</p>\n<p id=\"b1019-22\">I</p>\n<p id=\"b1019-23\">Richard Nixon resigned his office as President of the United States on August 9, <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"946\">*946</page-number>1974. On September 8, 1974, the same day that President Gerald Ford pardoned Mr. Nixon, the White House released the text of an agreement between Mr. Nixon and Arthur Sampson, Administrator of the GSA, concerning Mr. Nixon\u2019s presidential materials.<footnotemark>1</footnotemark> Under the terms of the agreement, Mr. Nixon retained all legal and equitable title to the materials and the GSA agreed to house them. Access to the materials was strictly limited. Mr. Nixon agreed to deposit materials other than the tape recordings described below for three years, during which no one could gain access without his approval. Mr. Nixon reserved the right to withdraw any materials he desired after three years. Tape recordings of White House or Executive Office Building conversations were to remain on deposit until September 1, 1979, and access was limited to persons approved by the former President. After September 1, 1979, GSA agreed to destroy tape recordings upon Mr. Nixon\u2019s request. Finally, all tape recordings were to be destroyed when Mr. Nixon died, or on September 1, 1984, whichever event occurred first.</p>\n<p id=\"b1020-4\">On October 17,1974, Mr. Nixon brought a suit seeking a temporary restraining order and preliminary injunction to enforce the Nixon-Sampson agreement.<footnotemark>2</footnotemark> Four days later, Jack Anderson, a journalist whose FOIA request for presidential materials had been denied on the basis of the Nixon-Sampson agreement, intervened to prevent implementation of the agreement.<footnotemark>3</footnotemark> Also on October 21, 1974, the Reporters Committee for Freedom of the Press, et al.,<footnotemark>4</footnotemark> appellants here, filed suit seeking to restrain the agreement and to obtain access to the materials pursuant to the FOIA.<footnotemark>5</footnotemark> Three days later, Lillian Heilman and other members of the Committee for Public Justice, filed a similar action which sought specified presidential tape recordings.<footnotemark>6</footnotemark> All of these actions were consolidated.</p>\n<p id=\"b1020-13\">On December 19, 1974, President Ford signed into law the Presidential Recordings and Materials Preservation Act, which included a provision giving the United States District Court for the District of Columbia exclusive jurisdiction to hear any challenges to the constitutionality of title I of the Act.<footnotemark>7</footnotemark> Mr. Nixon immediately filed a suit, <em>Nixon v. Administrator</em><footnotemark><em>8</em></footnotemark><em> </em>to enjoin the operation of the Materials Act and asked that a three-judge court be convened to hear his constitutional challenges.</p>\n<p id=\"b1020-14\">Before Mr. Nixon\u2019s request was acted upon, the district court issued an opinion in the consolidated cases, <em>Nixon v. Sampson, </em>389 F.Supp. 107 (D.D.C.1975), but entry of the order implementing the opinion was <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"947\">*947</page-number>stayed by this court pending the convening of a three-judge court.<footnotemark>9</footnotemark> The three-judge court held that the Materials Act was facially constitutional,<footnotemark>10</footnotemark> and the Supreme Court affirmed.<footnotemark>11</footnotemark> <em>Nixon v. Administrator, </em>408 F.Supp. 321 (D.D.C.1976), <em>aff\u2019d, </em>433 U.S. 425, 97 S.Ct. 2777, 53 L.Ed.2d 867 (1977).</p>\n<p id=\"A3Rq\">After the Supreme Court\u2019s decision, attention turned again to the consolidated cases, <em>Nixon v. Sampson. </em>The government defendants moved to dismiss the actions as <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"948\">*948</page-number>moot in light of <em>Nixon v. Administrator. </em>Appendix at 67. The district court granted the motion, <em>Nixon v. Sampson, </em>437 F.Supp. at 656. The district court held that the Materials Act\u2019s access provisions mooted the requests for presidential materials under the FOIA and the Materials Act\u2019s provision guaranteeing the government\u2019s custody and control of the materials mooted the ownership issue. <em>Id. </em>at 655-56. Mr. Nixon, who supported the government defendants\u2019 motion to dismiss, <em>id. </em>at 655 n. 5, joins those defendants as an appellee in this challenge to the district court\u2019s decision.</p>\n<p id=\"b1022-4\">II</p>\n<p id=\"b1022-5\">Appellees argued in the district court that the Materials Act provides the exclusive means for obtaining access to the recordings and materials. Appellants point to the language of section 104(d) of the Materials Act to support their contention that their FOIA requests should proceed. Section 104(d), note following 44 U.S.C. \u00a7 2107 (Supp. V 1975), provides:</p>\n<blockquote id=\"b1022-6\">The provisions of this title shall not in any way affect the rights, limitations or exemptions applicable under the Freedom of Information Act, 5 U.S.C. \u00a7 552 et seq.</blockquote>\n<p id=\"AtJ\">In spite of the seemingly clear language of section 104(d), appellees contend that various principles of statutory construction mandate that the Materials Act be interpreted to block these FOIA requests.<footnotemark>12</footnotemark> However, \u201ceven the most basic general principles of statutory construction must yield to clear contrary evidence of legislative intent.\u201d <em>National Railroad Passenger Corp. v. National Association of Railroad Passengers, </em>414 U.S. 453, 458, 94 S.Ct. 690, 693, 38 L.Ed.2d 646 (1974). <em>See Neuberger v. Commissioner, </em>311 U.S. 83, 88, 61 S.Ct. 97, 85 L.Ed. 58 (1940). Accordingly, we have examined the legislative history of section 104(d) and we conclude that the Materials Act does not bar processing of FOIA requests for the presidential materials in question.</p>\n<p id=\"b1022-10\">Section 104(d) had its genesis in the report of the House Committee on House Administration,<footnotemark>13</footnotemark> which substituted a House version of the Materials Act for that passed by the Senate.<footnotemark>14</footnotemark> The report explicitly stated that none of the Materials Act\u2019s provisions regarding access to materials \u201care intended to limit access by the public, otherwise granted by the Freedom of Information Act.\u201d<footnotemark>15</footnotemark> When the bill was returned to the Senate, Senator Nelson offered a floor amendment to codify the expressed intent of the House Committee. The amendment became section 104(d). 120 Cong.Rec. 38532 (1974). In the subsequent House debate that preceded approval of the Senate <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"949\">*949</page-number>amendment, Representative Brademas explained that the amendment \u201cis intended to make clear that access to the material which may otherwise be authorized by the Freedom of Information Act shall not be limited by the provisions of this title.\u201d 120 Cong.Rec. 38646 (1974). With the purpose of congressional action so clear, our conclusion follows the \u201ccardinal principle\u201d of legislative interpretation: to give effect to the intent of Congress. <em>City of New York v. Train, </em>161 U.S.App.D.C. 114, 123, 494 F.2d 1033, 1042 (1974), <em>aff\u2019d, </em>420 U.S. 35, 95 S.Ct. 839, 43 L.Ed.2d 1 (1975).</p>\n<p id=\"b1023-4\">The appellees suggest, however, that the interpretation of section 104(d) we adopt may cause constitutional difficulties. The appellees argue that release of presidential materials without the specific statutory safeguards embodied in section 104(a)<footnotemark>16</footnotemark> might impair Mr. Nixon\u2019s constitutional rights. This contention is based on appellees\u2019 reading of <em>Nixon </em>v. <em>Administrator, </em>433 U.S. 425, 97 S.Ct. 2777, 53 L.Ed.2d 867 (1977). The Supreme Court, upholding the Materials Act in face of Mr. Nixon\u2019s claim that the archival screening process would impair his constitutional right to privacy, focused attention on the specific provisions of the Act that protect Mr. Nixon\u2019s privacy. The Court concluded:</p>\n<blockquote id=\"b1023-5\">[AJppellant has a legitimate expectation of privacy in his personal communications. But the constitutionality of the Act must be viewed in the context of the limited intrusion of the screening process, of appellant\u2019s status as a public figure, of his lack of any expectation of privacy in the overwhelming majority of the materials, of the important public interest in preservation of the materials, and of the virtual impossibility of segregating the small quantity of private materials without comprehensive screening. When this is combined with the Act\u2019s sensitivity to appellant\u2019s legitimate privacy interests, see \u00a7 104(a)(7), the unblemished record of the archivists for discretion, and the likelihood that the regulations to be promulgated by the Administrator will further moot appellant\u2019s fears that his materials will be reviewed by \u201ca host of persons,\u201d Brief for Appellant 150, we are compelled to agree with the District Court that appellant\u2019s privacy claim is without merit.</blockquote>\n<p id=\"b1023-9\">433 U.S. at 465, 97 S.Ct. at 2801 (footnote omitted). Even if, as Mr. Nixon asserts, the Materials Act\u2019s protection of his interests was the \u201ctouchstone\u201d for the decision in <em>Nixon v. Administrator, see </em>Brief for Appellee Nixon at 7, Mr. Nixon\u2019s asserted constitutionally based privacy interests in some of the materials now under government control<footnotemark>17</footnotemark> will not be infringed by our decision today, which merely allows FOIA requests to proceed unhindered by the Materials Act. After this case returns to district court, Mr. Nixon will be free to raise constitutional objections to screening or disclosure carried on pursuant to any specific FOIA request. In the event a district court finds that any request for particular papers will lead to impingement upon Mr. Nixon\u2019s constitutional rights, it has the equitable power to protect Mr. Nixon\u2019s constitutional interests. <em>See Bell v. Hood, </em>327 U.S. 678, 684, 66 S.Ct. 773, 90 L.Ed. 939 (1946); <em>Ex parte Young, </em>209 U.S. 123, 149, 167-68, 28 S.Ct. 441, 52 L.Ed. 714 (1908); Dellinger, <em>Of Rights and Remedies: The Constitution as a Sword, </em>85 Harv.L.Rev. 1532, 1540-43 (1972). <em>See also </em>5 U.S.C. \u00a7 552(b)(6) (1976).<footnotemark>18</footnotemark></p>\n<p id=\"AId\"><page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"950\">*950</page-number>Mr. Nixon also contends that screening of documents mandated by an FOIA request will disrupt the screening undertaken to carry out the Materials Act. Like the constitutional argument previously discussed, this objection does not address whether the FOIA requests can go forward, but merely raises concerns with the procedures by which processing of the requests may be carried out. We believe that fears of massive disruption by requests for huge, vaguely defined chunks of presidential material are largely unfounded. The FOIA specifically requires that requests such as the ones made here \u201creasonably describe[ ]\u201d the records sought. 5 U.S.C. \u00a7 552(a)(3)(A) (1976). <em>See Fonda v. CIA, </em>434 F.Supp. 498, 501 (D.D.C.1977), <em>remanded sub nom. Hayden v. CIA, </em>No. 77-1984 (D.C.Cir. Nov. 15, 1978) (per curiam). <em>See also </em>K. Davis, Administrative Law of the Seventies, \u00a7 3A.9-1 (1976); Note, <em>Developments Under the Freedom of Information Act 1974, </em>1975 Duke L.J. 416, 439-40 n. 105 (1975); Note, <em>The Freedom of Information Act Amendments of 1974: An Analysis, </em>26 Syracuse L.Rev. 951, 959-60 (1975). In any event, the possible duplication of effort arising from availability of records under both the FOIA and the Materials Act cannot negate the clear intent of Congress to preserve rights of access under the FOIA.</p>\n<p id=\"b1024-8\">III</p>\n<p id=\"b1024-9\">In conjunction with their FOIA action, appellants sought a declaration that Mr. Nixon\u2019s presidential materials are owned by the United States. The district court dismissed the declaratory judgment action as moot on the ground that the provisions of the Materials Act gave custody and control of these presidential materials to the government.<footnotemark>19</footnotemark> The Materials Act itself leaves open the specific issue whether the United States owns the materials. <em>See </em>H.Rep. No. 93-1507, 93d Cong., 2d Sess. 7 (1974); 120 Cong.Rec. 33850-51 (1974) (remarks of Sen. Nelson). Section 105(a) vests exclusive jurisdiction in the United States District Court for the District of Columbia to hear, <em>inter alia, </em>any action involving the question of ownership.</p>\n<p id=\"b1024-10\">As the district court recognized, an issue is moot if it has lost its character as a present, live controversy. <em>See Nixon </em>v. <em>Sampson, </em>437 F.Supp. at 655 (citing <em>Diffenderfer v. Central Baptist Church, </em>404 U.S. 412, 415, 92 S.Ct. 574, 30 L.Ed.2d 567 (1972)); <em>see generally Alton &amp; Southern Railway v. IAM, </em>150 U.S.App.D.C. 36, 40-41, 463 F.2d 872, 876-77 (1972). With respect to access under the FOIA, the ownership issue is not moot, because neither the Materials Act nor <em>Nixon v. Administrator,</em><footnotemark><em>20</em></footnotemark><em> </em><page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"951\">*951</page-number>resolved the issue or changed its character.

Sampson, </em>this court denied Mr. Nixon\u2019s petition for mandamus to require the district judge to act immediately on his request for a three-judge court pursuant to 28 U.S.C. \u00a7 2282 (1970) and to give the constitutional challenge priority over a decision in the consolidated cases. Although this court denied Mr. Nixon\u2019s petition, it ordered the district court to consider the three-judge question before taking further action on the consolidated cases. <em>Nixon v. Richey, </em>168 U.S.App.D.C. 169, 172, 513 F.2d 427, 430 (1975) (per curiam). The same day, the district court judge issued an opinion in the consolidated cases, <em>Nixon v.

GSA, </em>425 U.S. 820, 834, 96 S.Ct. 1961, 1968, 48 L.Ed.2d 402 (1976), which states that \u201ca precisely drawn, detailed statute pre-empts more general remedies,\u201d to reach its conclusion that the particular terms of the Act provide the exclusive access to these presidential materials. <em>Brown v. GSA </em>held that section 717 of the Civil Rights Act of 1964 provides the exclusive judicial remedy for claims of discrimination in federal employment. <em>Id. </em>at 835, 96 S.Ct. 1961. The Supreme Court was forced to resort to principles of statutory interpretation because \u201cCongress simply failed explicitly to describe \u00a7 717\u2019s position in the constellation of antidiscrimination law.\u201d <em>Id. </em>at 825, 96 S.Ct. at 1964. Here Congress has explicitly related the operation of the FOIA to the Materials Act.</p>\n<p id=\"b1022-8\">The government appellees also argue that allowing FOIA requests to proceed would lead to an absurd result incompatible with the structure of the Materials Act. However, we believe that the existence of an alternate method of access is completely compatible with Congress\u2019s intent to guarantee that materials from the Nixon presidency were available to the public; see 120 Cong.Rec. at 33971-72 (1974) (remarks of Sen. Nelson); <em>id. </em>at 33855 (remarks of Sen. Ervin); <em>id. </em>at 37900-01 (remarks of Rep. Brademas); <em>id. </em>at 37905 (remarks of Rep. McKinney); H.Rep. No. 93-1507, 93d Cong., 2d Sess. 2 (1974). After all, when the Materials Act was passed, Congress could well have believed that the FOIA would not cover all of Mr. Nixon\u2019s materials that related to Watergate or were of general historical interest. <em>See </em>5 U.S.C. \u00a7 552(e) (1976); S.Rep.

Although we hold that the ownership issue is not moot, the district court is free to examine whether this request for declaratory action fulfills other justiciability requirements. Specifically, the district court may wish to examine whether these plaintiffs have established their standing to litigate in a declaratory judgment action the question of whether the government or Mr. Nixon is the owner of all these materials, <em>see Duke Power Co. v. Carolina Environmental Study Group, Inc., </em>438 U.S. 59, 72-78, 98 S.Ct. 2620, 2630-2633, 57 L.Ed.2d 595 (1978); <em>Simon v. Eastern Ky.
