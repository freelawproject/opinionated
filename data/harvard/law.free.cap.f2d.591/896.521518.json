BACKGROUND</p>\n<p id=\"b971-24\">On 22 September 1975 the Interstate Commerce Commission had published in the Federal Register a Notice and Order<footnotemark>2</footnotemark> which provided, in pertinent part, as follows:</p>\n<blockquote id=\"b971-25\">ENTRY CONTROL OF BROKERS</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b971-26\">Notice of Proceeding</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b971-27\">Purpose: The Interstate Commerce Commission has always endeavored to review the current extent of its jurisdiction over the surface transportation industry <em>and to propose to the Congress appropriate legislation </em>which would alter that jurisdiction, pursuant to the provisions of the Interstate Commerce Act. The purpose of this document is to institute a <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"898\">*898</page-number>proceeding to invest\u00edgate the need for continued regulation of brokers of property and passengers, operating in interstate or foreign commerce, <em>and to consider what, if any, legislative amendments of Section 211 of the Act ought to be recommended </em>to the Congress.</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b972-4\">******</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b972-5\"><em>It is ordered, </em>That based on the reasons set forth in the attached notice, a proceeding be, and it is hereby, instituted (1) for the purposes of investigating the present licensing requirements for brokers of property and passengers, operating in interstate or foreign commerce, <em>and (2) for the possible formulation of legislation </em>which would amend Section 211 of the Interstate Commerce Act for subsequent recommendation to the Congress.</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b972-6\">******</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b972-7\">I. On July 7, 1975, the Interstate Commerce Commission announced the results of an internal staff study of the Agency\u2019s operations. The unprecedented \u201cBlue Ribbon Staff Study Panel\u201d made four reports to the Commission, including over 60 recommendations for internal, procedural, and substantive reform. <em>Among these was the recommendation that Section 211 of the Interstate Commerce Act be amended </em>so as to eliminate entry control requirements for broker licenses.</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b972-8\">******</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b972-9\">[I]n light of the study panel\u2019s recommendation and our continuing interest in scrutinizing the scope of this Commission\u2019s regulatory jurisdiction, we deem it in the public interest to institute this proceeding to consider (1) the need for and effectiveness of Section 211 of the Interstate Commerce Act in its present form, <em>and (2) any possible legislative amendments to that section which should be proposed to the Congress.</em></blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b972-13\">******</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b972-14\">This Commission, however, would appreciate the views, comments, and suggestions of any interested parties relating to the above inquiries <em>and to any possible, pertinent, and constructive legislation we may propose to the Congress </em>in this area.</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"AHD\">******</blockquote>\n<p id=\"b972-15\">A period of comment followed, during which written statements were received. The Commission then closed the record but, upon request from National Tour Brokers Association (NTBA), reopened the proceeding to hear oral argument on 9 August 1976.<footnotemark>3</footnotemark></p>\n<p id=\"b972-16\">In April of the following year, rather than proposing legislative changes to Congress, the Commission issued final rules involving both substantive and procedural changes with regard to the licensing of tour brokers.<footnotemark>4</footnotemark></p>\n<p id=\"b972-17\">On 8 July 1977 NTBA filed a \u201cPetition to Reconsider and Vacate Report and Order and for Further Relief\u201d (Petition for Reconsideration). This petition alleged six specifications of error, the first of which was:</p>\n<blockquote id=\"ASN\">(A) That the purported Notice initiating the proceeding, later characterized by the Commission as a notice of proposed rulemaking, failed to comply with the Administrative Procedure Act and the requirements of constitutional due process; <footnotemark>5</footnotemark></blockquote>\n<p id=\"b973-3\"><page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"899\">*899</page-number>By order served 26 August 1977, the Commission denied the Petition for Reconsideration, disagreeing with each specification of error.<footnotemark>6</footnotemark></p>\n<p id=\"b973-4\">NTBA is now before this court seeking review of the Commission\u2019s action.<footnotemark>7</footnotemark></p>\n<p id=\"b973-5\">II. ANALYSIS</p>\n<p id=\"b973-6\">We hold that in this case the ICC failed to comply with the notice requirements of the Administrative Procedure Act. Section 4(a) of the Act (5 U.S.C. \u00a7 553(b)) provides:</p>\n<blockquote id=\"Ah2\">General notice of proposed rule making shall be published in the Federal Register, unless persons subject thereto are named and either personally served or otherwise have actual notice thereof in accordance with law. The notice shall include\u2014</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b973-7\">(1) a statement of the time, place, and nature of public rule making proceedings;</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b973-8\">(2) reference to the legal authority under which the rule is proposed; and</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b973-9\">(3) either the terms or substance of the proposed rule or a description of the subjects and issues involved.</blockquote>\n<p id=\"b973-10\">A. <em>Constructive Notice</em></p>\n<p id=\"b973-11\">The first clause of \u00a7 553(b) provides for constructive notice: \u201cGeneral notice of proposed rule making shall be published in the Federal Register.\u201d We are unable to find that the Commission satisfied this requirement.<footnotemark>8</footnotemark> It is true that the Commission published a general notice in the Federal Register, but it was not a notice of proposed rulemaking. A fair reading of that item clearly indicates that it was one looking toward the formulation of possible legislative amendments which might be proposed to Congress, not administrative rulemaking. It seems that the Commission changed its mind halfway through this proceeding<footnotemark>9</footnotemark> and is now attempting to correct its procedural deficiencies by characterizing the proceeding <em>ex post facto </em>as informal rulemaking. If this court were to countenance such procedure in this case, it is difficult to see where the line would ultimately be drawn. The constructive notice requirement of \u00a7 553(b) would be gutted of virtually all its meaning. Agencies could in the future publish vague, ambiguous notices in the Federal Register, adverting obliquely to certain issues or proceedings, and then, months or years later, promulgate final rules and claim that constructive notice had been given. This cannot be the objective of the APA notice requirement.<footnotemark>10</footnotemark></p>\n<p id=\"b973-18\">The purpose of this requirement is clear \u2014 to put interested parties on notice that <em>administrative rulemaking </em>in certain areas is about to take place. We hold that the Commission failed to meet this requirement in this case.</p>\n<p id=\"b974-3\"><page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"900\">*900</page-number>This alleged \u201cnotice\u201d also did not provide, as required by \u00a7 553(b)(2), a \u201creference to the legal authority under which the rule is proposed.\u201d Such a reference would have included something along the lines of what the Commission <em>did </em>include when it promulgated its final rules, a year and a half later. Therein it stated, \u201cThe rule is issued under the authority of 49 U.S.C. 302, 303, 304, 305, 311, and 320, and 5 U.S.C. 553 and 559.\u201d<footnotemark>11</footnotemark> In the original notice which was published on 22 September 1975,<footnotemark>12</footnotemark> the only statutory section mentioned is \u00a7 211 of the Interstate Commerce Act.<footnotemark>13</footnotemark> Reference to this section alone is insufficient, and, in any event, this section was not referred to as \u201cthe legal authority under which the rule is proposed.\u201d It was referred to solely as a statute then in existence which might need to be altered or amended.</p>\n<p id=\"b974-4\">We also find that the Commission did not comply with \u00a7 553(b)(3), which requires that \u201c[t]he notice . . . include either the terms or substance of the proposed rule or a description of the subjects and issues involved.\u201d Certainly the Commission did not include \u201cthe terms or substance of the proposed rule.\u201d However, the Commission argues that certain references in the notice were an adequate \u201cdescription of the subjects and issues involved.\u201d<footnotemark>14</footnotemark> Our response is that, while this may<footnotemark>15</footnotemark> have been an adequate description of the subjects and issues involved for purposes of suggestions for legislative changes, it was not adequate for purposes of subsequently promulgated administrative rules. \u201cDescription[s] of subjects and issues\u201d are of very little use to interested parties unless such parties are accurately apprised of the <em>purpose </em>of the proceeding in which those subjects and issues are being aired. The attitude one takes towards issues may vary considerably depending on the context in which those issues are placed. The legislative change sought in this case was basically an expansion of the authority of the ICC,<footnotemark>16</footnotemark> while the administrative rules later issued addressed much more specific subjects such as territorial restrictions and bond amounts.<footnotemark>17</footnotemark></p>\n<p id=\"b974-14\">We cannot accept the effort of the ICC retroactively to characterize its \u201cNotice of Proceeding\u201d as suggesting the alternatives of recommending legislation <em>or </em>rulemaking. At the outset we quoted the Notice in some detail, emphasizing the repeated references to legislative amendments to Section 211 to be proposed, an objective beyond the scope of rulemaking. The ICC argues that the <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"901\">*901</page-number>reference to legislation was in each instance preceded by reference to the subject matter of the (no adjective) \u201cProceeding,\u201d and that this was \u201cNotice\u201d of Rulemaking. Whatever it was Notice of, it was not Notice of Rulemaking, for:</p>\n<blockquote id=\"b975-5\">(1) in all five quoted paragraphs (and throughout the Notice) the word \u201cRulemaking\u201d is not used; -</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b975-6\">(2) the connective between the first reference and the reference to proposed legislation is, in each instance, \u201cand\u201d, not \u201cor\u201d, hence there is no \u201calternative\u201d to legislation mentioned; and</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b975-7\">(3) all the other references, fairly considered, are only general descriptions of the subject to be discussed, with the ultimate procedural objective to be legislation.</blockquote>\n<p id=\"b975-8\">With specific attention to \u00a7 553(b)(3), naturally, the better course for the agency to follow is to publish in advance the \u201cterms or substance\u201d of the proposed rule. This allows the parties to direct their comments toward concrete proposals, not amorphous subject areas. Such an approach is designed to generate a focused inquiry by both the agency and the parties.<footnotemark>18</footnotemark> To the extent the agency descends to the particulars in its \u201cdescription of the subjects and issues involved,\u201d it more clearly complies with \u00a7 553(b)(3).</p>\n<p id=\"b975-9\">B. <em>Actual Notice</em></p>\n<p id=\"b975-10\">Section 553(b) allows the alternative of actual notice: . . unless persons subject thereto are named and either personally served or otherwise have actual notice thereof in accordance with law.\u201d</p>\n<p id=\"b975-15\">The Commission claims that actual notice was given to the parties at the oral hearing held 9 August 1976. The Commission\u2019s Chairman opened that hearing by outlining some of the questions the Commission hoped to resolve, among which was, \u201c[I]f the Commission does decide that entry controls are no longer necessary, should we seek legislation or is some other course of action available?\u201d<footnotemark>19</footnotemark> This is clearly not a statement that a rulemaking proceeding is taking place. Rather, it is an inquiry asking whether it would be advisable to undertake a rulemaking proceeding. The statement of NTBA\u2019s counsel later at that hearing, in response to the Chairman\u2019s introductory remarks, was in conformity with this meaning. Counsel stated:</p>\n<blockquote id=\"b975-16\">Now, our position is this. We urge [the Commission] not to submit to Congress legislative recommendation for change in Section 211. We also urge that you not attempt a change in Section 211 administratively.<footnotemark>20</footnotemark></blockquote>\n<p id=\"b975-17\">Counsel was simply stating that it did not think that an administrative rulemaking proceeding should be initiated. It was not an implicit concession that a rulemaking proceeding was then underway.</p>\n<p id=\"b975-18\">The Commission\u2019s final argument, a rather ingenious one, is that the promulgation of the final rules<footnotemark>21</footnotemark> constituted \u201cnotice,\u201d the period of reconsideration was the \u201ccomment\u201d period, and the order denying reconsideration amounted to promulgation of final rules.<footnotemark>22</footnotemark> However, this \u201crealignment\u201d argument must fall for several reasons, both statutory and policy.</p>\n<p id=\"b975-19\">First, \u00a7 553(b) speaks quite specifically about \u201cproposed\u201d rules, and a \u201cfinal\u201d rule <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"902\">*902</page-number>simply cannot be a \u201cproposed\u201d rule. For example, \u00a7 553(b)(2) requires that the notice include \u201creference to the legal authority under which the rule is <em>proposed \u201d </em>(emphasis added). Here, a year and a half later, we have reference to the legal authority under which the <em>final </em>rule was <em>promulgated. </em><footnotemark><em>23</em></footnotemark></p>\n<p id=\"b976-4\">Of even greater importance, though, is the purpose behind the requirement that the parties be able to comment on the rule while it is still in the formative or \u201cproposed\u201d stage. The purpose is both (1) to allow the agency to benefit from the expertise and input of the parties who file comments with regard to the proposed rule, and (2) to see to it that the agency maintains a flexible and open-minded attitude towards its own rules, which might be lost if the agency had already put its credibility on the line in the form of \u201cfinal\u201d rules. People naturally tend to be more close-minded and defensive once they have made a \u201cfinal\u201d determination.<footnotemark>24</footnotemark></p>\n<p id=\"b976-5\">This is supported by relevant precedent. With regard to the first point, it is stated that the purpose of \u00a7 553 is to \u201cenable[ ] the agency promulgating the rule to educate itself before establishing rules and procedures which have a substantial impact on those regulated.\u201d<footnotemark>25</footnotemark> With regard to the second point, \u201cWe doubt that persons would bother to submit their views or that the Secretary would seriously consider their suggestions after the regulations are a <em>fait </em>accompli.\u201d<footnotemark>26</footnotemark> With regard to the points generally, the Third Circuit, in the face of a claim that the opportunity to petition for the amendment or repeal of a final rule should cure defective notice, stated emphatically:</p>\n<blockquote id=\"b976-10\">Section 4(b) of the Administrative Procedure Act [5 U.S.C. \u00a7 553(b)] requires notice <em>before </em>rulemaking, not after. The right of interested persons to petition for the issuance, amendment or repeal of a rule, granted in Section 4(e) of that Act [5 U.S.C. \u00a7 553(e)], is neither a substitute for nor an alternative to compliance with the mandatory notice requirements of Section 4(b). (Emphasis original.)<footnotemark>27</footnotemark></blockquote>\n<p id=\"b976-11\">Perhaps the basic difficulty with the ICC\u2019s \u201crealignment\u201d argument is that in reality it is now defending a procedure conducted in inverse order from that contemplated by the APA. The order of procedure must be, first, to notice the proposed rule, <em>then </em>to receive the comments and evidence directed toward this proposed rule, and, finally, to promulgate the final rule. It simply will not do to redesignate the final rule as notice and claim the proceeding started from there, because it obviously did not. Nor can it be claimed that proposed legislation was the equivalent of a proposed rule, because no specific proposed legislation was ever formulated (nor was there any obligation on the ICC to do so, if legislation was what it had in mind, as it announced).</p>\n<p id=\"b976-12\">The deficiencies in an approach whereby the agency issues final rules before it receives (and benefits from) comments and input from the parties is graphically illustrated in the instant proceeding. In its initial decision promulgating the final rules here in issue, the Commission stated that</p>\n<blockquote id=\"b977-4\"><page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"903\">*903</page-number>[i]n all but a few eases, such bonds [j. e., tour broker surety bonds] will be written on a full collateral basis only, <em>i. </em>e., the broker must post with the surety company the coverage amount in cash or acceptable investment bonds.</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b977-5\">Surety companies, even before issuing bonds on a full collateral basis, thoroughly investigate a bond applicant as to reputation, integrity, business ability, and financial stability. The possibility of questionable fly-by-night brokers is thereby all but eliminated.<footnotemark>28</footnotemark></blockquote>\n<p id=\"b977-6\">As pointed out by petitioner<footnotemark>29</footnotemark> the Commission may be in serious error about how tour broker surety bonding actually works. An NTBA survey in May 1977 indicated that 85% of the members responding said that their insurance company <em>did not </em>require collateral backing for the bonds required by the Commission.<footnotemark>30</footnotemark> Secondly, little investigation is pursued before the bond is issued, since a $5,000 or $10,000 bond is such an insignificant amount of business to most insurance companies.<footnotemark>31</footnotemark> The average annual cost to the tour broker for a $5,000 bond is $56.78, which would not cover the cost of more than minimal investigation.<footnotemark>32</footnotemark></p>\n<p id=\"b977-7\">What may be rather serious errors on the part of the Commission with regard to substantive matters demonstrate to us that a reexamination of the whole area, properly focused from the start by a proposed rule, would not be a fruitless endeavor at all. It may be that the Commission in a new and properly focused inquiry will find, for example, that it needs to make more stringent requirements as to the fitness of newly licensed tour brokers, and that these stringent requirements will satisfy the questions (or fears) the present tour brokers have about the admission of an additional large number of brokers. We do not say the Commission should reach such a conclusion, only that we believe the Commission\u2019s ultimate conclusion may be different in several respects after a properly conducted new proceeding.</p>\n<p id=\"b977-12\">In conclusion, since we find that the Commission failed to comply with the relevant requirements of the APA, the order and rules at issue in this case are vacated and this case is remanded to the Commission for further proceedings not inconsistent with this opinion.</p>\n<p id=\"b977-13\">\n<em>So ordered.</em>\n</p>\n<footnote label=\"1\">\n<p id=\"b971-16\">. <em>Entry Control of Brokers, </em>126 M.C.C. 476 (1977), pet. for reconsideration denied, Ex parte No. MC-96 (26 Aug. 1977), J.A. at 43-161.

The Commission argues that the rules served on 26 April 1977 and published in the Federal Register on 29 April 1977 (42 Fed.Reg. 21782-84, J.A. at 130-32) were not \u201cfinal\u201d rules. However, they were labeled \u201cfinal rule[s]\u201d (see 42 Fed.Reg. 21782 (1975), J.A. at 130) and were treated in every respect like final rules. We see no merit in such a position.</p>\n</footnote>\n<footnote label=\"22\">\n<p id=\"b975-21\">.

The fact that the matter has been prejudged might very well discourage disclosure of pertinent points of view. For example, someone might be inclined to respond to an initial proposal because this could be done without the aid of professional advice. But he or she might not be similarly inclined to file a petition responding to the proposal\u2019s adoption because of a belief that to do so would require such advice.</blockquote>\n</footnote>\n<footnote label=\"25\">\n<p id=\"b976-14\">. <em>Texaco, Inc. v.
