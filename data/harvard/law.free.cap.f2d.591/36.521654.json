He was charged in a grand jury indictment along with David Glassman on the conspiracy charge only (18 U.S.C. \u00a7 371). Glass-man was also charged with wilfully and knowingly embezzling bank funds (18 U.S.C. \u00a7 656) and misapplying bank funds (18 U.S.C. \u00a7 371).</p>\n<p id=\"b112-5\">Before appellant\u2019s trial, Glassman pled guilty to violating 18 U.S.C. \u00a7 656 and to the conspiracy charge. Glassman became the chief prosecution witness against appellant. His testimony fully implicated appellant in the check kiting scheme.</p>\n<p id=\"b112-6\">According to Glassman\u2019s testimony, the check kite involved funds for a corporation called Pan American Tires, Inc., which Glassman and appellant had formed. At this time, Glassman was an operations officer for the Bank of California. Glassman would purchase cashier\u2019s checks from the Bank of California using insufficiently funded checks from the corporation\u2019s account at American Bank and Trust Co. The cashier\u2019s checks would then be deposited in the American Bank account to cover the cost of the cashier\u2019s checks. The scheme eventually cost the bank $675,000.</p>\n<p id=\"b112-7\">Since the checks from the American Bank used to purchase the cashier\u2019s checks were drawn on the corporate account, appellant had to sign them. But, as a defense, appellant claimed that Glassman handled all the financial dealings of the corporation while he only sold the tires.</p>\n<p id=\"b112-8\">Appellant testified in his own behalf and presented a corroborating witness in Richard Beserra, who served as the corporation\u2019s counsel. But, the jury apparently chose to believe Glassman\u2019s testimony and appellant was convicted.</p>\n<p id=\"b112-9\">Before this court, appellant argues that several evidentiary rulings made during the course of trial severely prejudiced his case, requiring that he be granted a new trial. He also alleges that the trial court judge improperly cross-examined Beserra.</p>\n<p id=\"b112-11\">i.e?f testify as to a statement made by appellant during a meeting. Attending this meeting were Glassman appellant, an atto \u00ae named Segura, and the corporation\u2019s att J ney, Beserra. Segura was at the to advise both Glassman and a about the pending check kiting investig\u00f3</p>\n<p id=\"b112-12\">The statement apWlant co , . about is: \u201cHe said that he \u00ed* tL t^ also be arrested and charge^ This was allowed despite streis^\u2019 \u2018 tion from appellant <em>who </em>asserted\\&gt;\u00b0^0S1-ney-client privilege. r\"</p>\n<p id=\"b112-14\">The Federal Rules of Evidence pi. that: 1e</p>\n<blockquote id=\"b112-17\">\u201c[T]he privilege of a witness, perso. government, State, or political subdivision thereof shall be governed by the principles of the common law as they may be interpreted by the courts of the United States in the light of reason and experience.\u201d Fed.R.Evid. 501.</blockquote>\n<p id=\"b112-18\">The attorney-client privilege has been recognized under this rule. Its scope is determined by federal law. <em>United States v. Hodge and Zweig, </em>548 F.2d 1347, 1353 (9th Cir. 1977). The burden of proving that the privilege applies is placed upon the party asserting the privilege. <em>United States v. Stern, </em>511 F.2d 1364, 1367 (2d Cir. 1975).</p>\n<p id=\"b112-19\">To have the privilege apply, the party must prove that:</p>\n<blockquote id=\"b112-20\">\u201c(1) Where legal advice of any kind is sought (2) from a professional legal advis- or in his capacity as such, (3) the communications relating to that purpose, (4) made in confidence (5) by the client, (6) are at his instance permanently protected (7) from disclosure by himself or by the legal advisor, (8) except the protection be waived . . .\u201d 8 <em>Wigmore, Evidence </em>\u00a7 2292 (McNaughton Rev. 1961).</blockquote>\n<p id=\"b112-22\"><em>See United States v. Stern, </em>511 F.2d at 1367-68; <em>United States </em>v. <em>Kovel, </em>296 F.2d 918, 921 (2d Cir. 1961).</p>\n<p id=\"b113-3\"><page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"39\">*39</page-number>The trial court here determined that appellant did not meet his burden because the communication was not made in confidence. The presence of Beserra as a third party was seen as destroying the privilege.</p>\n<p id=\"b113-4\">The mere presence of a third party at an attorney-client meeting does not necessarily destroy the privilege. <em>United States v. Kovel, supra; McCormick on Evidence, </em>\u00a7 91, 188-89 (2d ed. 1972); 8 <em>Wigmore, Evidence </em>\u00a7 2301 at 583. If, for example, Beserra was acting as an agent of appellant, the privilege would not necessarily be destroyed. Or, if Beserra was acting as an attorney, the privilege could be asserted.</p>\n<p id=\"b113-5\">But, appellant could not show to the trial court\u2019s satisfaction that Beserra was acting as an attorney or an agent at the meeting. There was sufficient evidence to support the trial court\u2019s conclusion. As a result, comments made at the meeting were not privileged and could be testified about.</p>\n<p id=\"b113-6\">Appellant\u2019s second evidentiary argument concerns the refreshing of Glassman\u2019s recollection from an FBI report prepared after an interview with Glassman. Appellant claims that use of the report was improper because it was not prepared by Glassman. But, the law is clear that recollection can be refreshed from documents made by persons other than the witness. <em>Nees v. SEC, </em>414 F.2d 211, 217-18 (9th Cir. 1969); 3 <em>Wigmore, Evidence </em>\u00a7\u00a7 758-59.</p>\n<p id=\"b113-7\">A third evidentiary ruling challenged by appellant involves the prosecution\u2019s use of evidence showing that he spent corporate funds for gambling. This was presented to rebut appellant\u2019s defense that he thought the extra transactions in the corporate account were special dealings of Glassman\u2019s using Glassman\u2019s own funds. Appellant claims that evidence of the use of proceeds of certain checks he wrote to the Reno Check Cashing Service was of little probative value and was highly prejudicial. But, the fact appellant wrote the checks on the corporate account to obtain money for personal purposes does rebut his defense. The evidence showed appellant\u2019s knowledge and was not improperly prejudicial.</p>\n<p id=\"b113-8\">Since none of the contested rulings has been found to be improper, no cumulative effect results in the finding of prejudice appellant urges.</p>\n<p id=\"b113-9\">Appellant alleges that the court\u2019s cross-examination of his key witness \u2014 Beserra\u2014 was prejudicially conducted. He argues that the judge singled out Beserra for this treatment, leaving the impression with the jury that the judge did not believe Beserra.</p>\n<p id=\"b113-10\">It is proper for the court to question witnesses in order to clarify questions and develop facts. As long as this is done in a nonprejudicial fashion, and the court does not become personally over-involved, it is proper. <em>See United States </em>v. <em>Sidman, </em>470 F.2d 1158 (9th Cir.), <em>cert. denied, </em>409 U.S. 1127, 93 S.Ct. 948, 35 L.Ed.2d 260 (1972); <em>McConney v. United States, </em>421 F.2d 248 (9th Cir.), <em>cert. denied, </em>400 U.S. 821, 91 S.Ct. 39, 27 L.Ed.2d 49 (1969).</p>\n<p id=\"b113-11\">A review of the court\u2019s examination of Beserra shows that the court was trying to clarify several matters including the number of meetings of the corporation that Beserra attended. (R.T. 692-901). Nothing the judge said suggested that he did not believe Beserra, or was becoming a partisan in the trial.</p>\n<p id=\"b113-12\">The conviction is AFFIRMED.</p>\n</opinion>\n</casebody>\n",
