We affirm.</p>\n<p id=\"b373-27\">Dubroc purchased a swivel chair from appellee W. T. Grant and Company (Grant). He used the chair, assembled by Grant, for several weeks, until it collapsed, causing him personal injuries. Dubroc filed suit against Grant and the chair\u2019s manufacturer. According to the evidence at trial, in assembling the chair Grant had not properly installed two bolts designed to hold together the chair\u2019s top and bottom parts. In response to the trial judge\u2019s interrogatories, the jury found that a defect in the chair <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"300\">*300</page-number>attributable to Grant was the proximate cause of Dubroc\u2019s accident and that $105,-000 would \u201cfairly and reasonably compensate\u201d him for the consequent damages. By agreement of the parties, the issue whether Dubroc, if successful, would also recover attorneys\u2019 fees was reserved to the court for decision at trial\u2019s end. After receiving memoranda from the parties and conducting a hearing, the district judge denied Dubroc\u2019s motion for attorneys\u2019 fees.</p>\n<p id=\"b374-4\">Under Louisiana law, \u201c[i]t is well recognized . . . that as a general rule attorney\u2019s fees are not allowed except where authorized by statute or contract.\u201d <em>Maloney v. Oak Builders, Inc., </em>1970, 256 La. 85, 235 So.2d 386, 390. Dubroc asserts that he is entitled to attorneys\u2019 fees under La.Civ. Code Ann. Art. 2545, which provides that</p>\n<blockquote id=\"Aqk\">[t]he seller, who knows the vice of the thing he sells and omits to declare it, besides the restitution of price and repayment of the expenses, <em>including reasonable attorneys' fees, </em>is answerable to the buyer in damages, (emphasis added)</blockquote>\n<p id=\"b374-6\">Art. 2545 is one of a series of statutes establishing the remedy of \u201credhibition,\u201d which is \u201cthe avoidance of a sale on account of some vice or defect in the thing sold, which renders it either absolutely useless, or its use so inconvenient and imperfect, that it must be supposed that the buyer would not have purchased it had he known of the vice.\u201d La.Civ.Code Ann. Art. 2520. Although Dubroc averred, in his third amended complaint, that the facts set forth in the original complaint \u201csound a cause of action in redhibition,\u201d his original complaint asserted negligence on the part of Grant and the chair\u2019s manufacturer and he recovered damages for personal injuries caused by a defect in the chair attributable to Grant. Reading Art. 2545, it is unclear whether that statute allows recovery of attorneys\u2019 fees, not only in redhibitory actions, but also to successful plaintiffs in personal injury suits. The parties have not cited, nor have we found, any decision by a Louisiana court resolving this issue. However, we conclude that the district court did not err in denying Dubroc\u2019s motion for attorneys\u2019 fees.</p>\n<p id=\"b374-7\">First, the inclusion of the attorneys\u2019 fees provision in the section of the Civil Code detailing the remedy of redhibition, though not dispositive, suggests that the legislature intended to limit the possible recovery of attorneys\u2019 fees to redhibitory actions. Second, the language of Art. 2545 also tends to support this view. The statute says that \u201cbesides the restitution of price and repayment of the expenses, including attorneys\u2019 fees,\u201d certain sellers are \u201canswerable to the buyer in damages.\u201d The phrase \u201cincluding attorneys\u2019 fees\u201d is thus linked to price restitution and repayment of expenses, both of which are peculiar to an action for redhibition, rather than to the recovery of damages, which might be available under a variety of remedies. Third and most important, we are mindful that in Louisiana the \u201cimposition of attorney\u2019s fees is penal in nature, is not favored and should not be imposed except in cases which are clear and free from any doubt.\u201d <em>Colonial Pipeline Co. v. Traigle, </em>La.App., 1977, 353 So.2d 728, 730; <em>Schwegmann Bros. Giant Super Mkts., Inc. v. Mouton, </em>La.App., 1975, 309 So.2d 686, 693; <em>Viator v. Haynesville Mercantile Company, Inc., </em>1956, 230 La. 132, 88 So.2d 1, 4. As the foregoing discussion illustrates, this is not such a case. Because we cannot say that the recovery of attorneys\u2019 fees here is \u201cclearly authorized\u201d by Art. 2545, <em>Fuchs v. LaBruyere, </em>La.App., 1971, 242 So.2d 349, 350, we affirm the district court\u2019s order denying Dubroc\u2019s motion.</p>\n<p id=\"b374-8\">AFFIRMED.</p>\n</opinion>\n</casebody>\n",
