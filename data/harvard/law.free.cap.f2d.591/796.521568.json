The district court disagreed, and issued a writ of mandamus directing the Register to enter the claim to copyright. <em>Esquire, Inc. v. Ringer, </em>414 F.Supp. 939 (D.D.C.1976). For the reasons expressed below, we reverse.</p>\n<p id=\"b872-20\">I.</p>\n<p id=\"b872-21\">Although the issues involved are fairly complex, the facts may be briefly stated. Appellee, Esquire, Inc. (Esquire) submitted three applications to the Copyright Office for registration of what it described as \u201cartistic design[s] for lighting fixture[s].\u201d<footnotemark>1</footnotemark> Photographs accompanying the applications showed stationary outdoor luminaries or floodlights, of contemporary design, with rounded or elliptically-shaped housings.<footnotemark>2</footnotemark> The applications asserted that the designs were eligible for copyright protection as \u201cworks of art.\u201d 17 U.S.C. \u00a7 5(g).</p>\n<p id=\"b872-22\">The Register of Copyrights (Register) refused to register Esquire\u2019s claims to copyright. The principal reason given was that Copyright Office regulations, specifically 37 C.F.R. \u00a7 202.10(c) (1976), preclude registration of the design of a utilitarian article, such as lighting fixtures, \u201cwhen all of the design elements . . . are directly related to the useful functions of the article. . \u201d<footnotemark>3</footnotemark> The fixtures, according to the Register\u2019s analysis, did not contain \u201celements, either alone or in combination, which are capable of independent existence as a copyrightable pictorial, graphic, or sculptur<page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"799\">*799</page-number>al work apart from the utilitarian aspect.\u201d<footnotemark>4</footnotemark> Esquire twice requested reconsideration of its copyright applications,<footnotemark>5</footnotemark> and was twice refused.<footnotemark>6</footnotemark></p>\n<p id=\"b873-5\">Esquire then filed suit in the district court, seeking a writ of mandamus directing the Register to issue a certificate of copyright for its lighting fixture designs. This time, Esquire met with success. The court, per Judge Gesell, concluded that registration was compelled by <em>Mazer v. Stein, </em>347 U.S. 201, 74 S.Ct. 460, 98 L.Ed. 630 (1954), where the Supreme Court upheld the copyright of statuettes intended to be mass-produced for use as table lamp bases. The district court reasoned that to uphold the issuance of the copyrights in <em>Mazer, </em>but deny Esquire\u2019s applications, would amount to affording certain copyright privileges to traditional works of art, but not to abstract, modern art forms. The court went on to find that \u201c[t]he forms of the articles here in dispute are clearly art\u201d and concluded that they were \u201centitled to the same recognition afforded more traditional sculpture.\u201d 414 F.Supp. at 941. The court also suggested that registration of Esquire\u2019s designs was compelled by prior \u201cinterpretative precedent.\u201d Id. This appeal followed.</p>\n<p id=\"b873-7\">The heart of the controversy in this ease involves, in the district court\u2019s words, an \u201celusive semantic dispute\u201d over the applicable regulation, 37 C.F.R. \u00a7 202.10(c). We have divided our analysis of this dispute into two parts: Part II considers whether the Register adopted a permissible interpretation of the regulation; Part III, whether the regulation, as interpreted, was properly applied to the facts presented by Esquire\u2019s applications.<footnotemark>7</footnotemark></p>\n<p id=\"b873-8\">II.</p>\n<p id=\"b873-9\">A.</p>\n<p id=\"b873-10\">Section 5(g) of the Copyright Act of 1909, 17 U.S.C. \u00a7 5(g), indicates that \u201c[w]orks of art; models or designs for works of art\u201d are eligible for copyright.<footnotemark>8</footnotemark> The terse language of the statute is more fully elaborated in regulations drafted by the Register pursuant to Congressional authorization.<footnotemark>9</footnotemark> The <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"800\">*800</page-number>provision at issue, 37 C.F.R. \u00a7 202.10(c), provides as follows:</p>\n<blockquote id=\"b874-4\">(c) If the sole intrinsic function of an article is its utility, the fact that the article is unique and attractively shaped will not qualify it as a work of art. However, if the shape of a utilitarian article incorporates features, such as artistic sculpture, carving, or pictorial representation, which can be identified separately and are capable of existing independently as a work of art, such features will be eligible for registration.</blockquote>\n<p id=\"b874-5\">The parties have advanced conflicting interpretations of \u00a7 202.10(c). The Register interprets \u00a7 202.10(c) to bar copyright registration of the overall shape or configuration of a utilitarian article, no matter how aesthetically pleasing that shape or configuration may be. As support for this interpretation, the Register notes that the regulation limits copyright protection to features of a utilitarian article that \u201ccan be identified separately and are capable of existing independently as a work of art.\u201d The Register argues that this reading is required to enforce the congressional policy against copyrighting industrial designs, and that it is supported by the continued practice of the Copyright Office and by legislative history.</p>\n<p id=\"b874-6\">Esquire on the other hand, interprets \u00a7 202.10(c) to allow copyright registration for the overall shape or design of utilitarian articles as long as the shape or design satisfies the requirements appurtenant to works of art \u2014 originality and creativity.<footnotemark>10</footnotemark> Esquire stresses that the first sentence of \u00a7 202.10(c) reads in its entirety, \u201cIf the <em>sole </em>intrinsic function of an article is its utility, the fact that the article is unique and attractively shaped will not qualify it as a work of art.\u201d Esquire maintains that it designed its lighting fixtures with the intent of creating \u201cworks of modernistic form sculpture,\u201d<footnotemark>11</footnotemark> and therefore that their <em>sole </em>intrinsic function is not utility. Esquire also contends that the language of \u00a7 202.-10(c) referring to \u201cfeatures which can be identified separately and are capable of existing independently as a work of art\u201d is not inconsistent with its interpretation. In effect, Esquire asserts that the <em>shape </em>of the lighting fixtures is the \u201cfeature\u201d that makes them eligible for copyright as a work of art. Esquire argues that its reading of \u00a7 202.10(c) is required by the decisions of the Supreme Court in <em>Mazer v. Stein, </em>347 U.S. 201, 74 S.Ct. 460, 98 L.Ed. 630 (1954) and <em>Bleistein v. Donaldson Lithographing Co., </em>188 U.S. 239, 23 S.Ct. 298, 47 L.Ed. 460 (1903).</p>\n<p id=\"b874-11\">B.</p>\n<p id=\"b874-12\">We conclude that the Register has adopted a reasonable and well-supported interpretation of \u00a7 202.10(c).</p>\n<p id=\"b874-13\">The Register\u2019s interpretation of \u00a7 202.10(c) derives from the principle that industrial designs are not eligible for copyright. Congress has repeatedly rejected proposed legislation that would make copyright protection available for consumer or industrial products.<footnotemark>12</footnotemark> Most recently, Congress deleted a proposed section from the Copyright Act of 1976 that would have \u201ccreate[d] a new limited form of copyright protection for \u2018original\u2019 designs which are <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"801\">*801</page-number>clearly a part of a useful article, regardless of whether such designs could stand by themselves, separate from the article itself.\u201d <footnotemark>13</footnotemark> In rejecting proposed Title II, Congress noted the administration\u2019s concern that to make such designs eligible for copyright would be to create a \u201cnew monopoly\u201d <footnotemark>14</footnotemark> having obvious and significant anti-competitive effects.<footnotemark>15</footnotemark> The issues raised by Title II were left for further consideration in \u201cmore complete hearings\u201d to follow the enactment of the 1976 Act.<footnotemark>16</footnotemark></p>\n<p id=\"b875-5\">In the Register\u2019s view, registration of the overall shape or configuration of utilitarian articles would lead to widespread copyright protection for industrial designs. The Register reasons that aesthetic considerations enter into the design of most useful objects. Thus, if overall shape or configuration can qualify as a \u201cwork of art,\u201d \u201cthe whole realm of consumer products \u2014 garments, toasters, refrigerators, furniture, bathtubs, automobiles, etc. \u2014 and industrial products designed to have aesthetic appeal \u2014 subway cars, computers, photocopying machines, typewriters, adding machines, etc. \u2014 must also qualify as works of art.\u201d <footnotemark>17</footnotemark></p>\n<p id=\"b875-12\">Considerable weight is to be given to an agency\u2019s interpretation of its regulations. \u201c[T]he ultimate criterion is the administrative interpretation, which becomes of controlling weight unless it is plainly erroneous or inconsistent with the regulation.\u201d <em>Bowles v. Seminole Rock &amp; Sand Co., </em>325 U.S. 410, 414, 65 S.Ct. 1215, 1217, 89 L.Ed. 1700 (1945); <em>accord, Udall v. Tallman, </em>380 U.S. 1, 16-18, 85 S.Ct. 792, 13 L.Ed.2d 616 (1965); <em>Stein </em>v. <em>Mazer, </em>204 F.2d 472, 477 (4th Cir. 1953), <em>aff'd., </em>347 U.S. 201, 74 S.Ct. 460, 98 L.Ed. 630 (1954). This is particularly so if an administrative interpretation relates to a matter within the field of administrative expertise and has been consistently followed for a significant period of time. <em>Southern Mutual Help Ass\u2019n v. Califano, </em>187 U.S.App.D.C. 307, 574 F.2d 518, 526 (1977). The Register\u2019s interpretation of \u00a7 202.10(c) reflects both administrative expertise and consistent application.</p>\n<p id=\"b875-13\">The regulation in question attempts to define the boundaries between copyrightable \u201cworks of art\u201d and noncopyrightable industrial designs. This is an issue of longstanding concern to the Copyright Office, and is clearly a matter in which the Register has considerable expertise.<footnotemark>18</footnotemark></p>\n<p id=\"b876-3\"><page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"802\">*802</page-number>Whether the Register\u2019s interpretation has been consistently followed for a significant period of time is somewhat less clear. Since the Copyright Office does not publish opinions explaining registration decisions, there is little evidence bearing directly on this point. What evidence exists, however, indicates that the Register\u2019s construction has been followed consistently.<footnotemark>19</footnotemark> The district court suggested, without elaboration, that prior registration decisions create an \u201cinterpretative precedent\u201d favoring Esquire\u2019s position. 414 F.Supp. at 941. But we think this confuses the <em>test </em>employed by the Copyright Office in evaluating the copyrightability of utilitarian articles with the <em>results </em>that obtained after the test was applied. The Register\u2019s test requires the application of subjective judgment, and given the large volume of copyright applications that must be processed there may be some results that are difficult to square with the denial of registration here.<footnotemark>20</footnotemark> But this does not mean that the Register has employed different standards in reaching these decisions. The available evidence points to a uniform and longstanding interpretation of \u00a7 202.10(c), and accordingly this interpretation is entitled to great weight.</p>\n<p id=\"b876-10\">The Register\u2019s interpretation of \u00a7 202.10(c) finds further support in the legislative history of the recently enacted 1976 <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"803\">*803</page-number>Copyright Act.<footnotemark>21</footnotemark> Although not applicable to the case before us,<footnotemark>22</footnotemark> the new Act was designed in part to codify and clarify many of the regulations promulgated under the 1909 Act, including those governing \u201cworks of art.\u201d<footnotemark>23</footnotemark> Thus, the 1976 Act and its legislative history can be taken as an expression of congressional understanding of the scope of protection for utilitarian articles under the old regulations. \u201cSubsequent legislation which declares the intent of an earlier law is not, of course, conclusive . But the later law is entitled to weight when it comes to the problem of construction.\u201d <em>Federal Housing Administration v. The Darlington, Inc., </em>358 U.S. 84, 90, 79 S.Ct. 141, 145, 3 L.Ed.2d 132 (1958).</p>\n<p id=\"b877-6\">The House Report indicates that the section of the 1976 Act governing \u201cpictorial, graphic and sculptural works\u201d was intended \u201cto draw as clear a line as possible between copyrightable works of applied art and uncopyrighted works of industrial design.\u201d<footnotemark>24</footnotemark> The Report illustrates the distinction in the following terms:</p>\n<blockquote id=\"b877-7\">. although the shape of an industrial product may be aesthetically satisfying and valuable, the Committee\u2019s intention is not to offer it copyright protection under the bill. Unless the shape of an automobile, airplane, ladies\u2019 dress, food processor, television set, or any other industrial product contains some element that, physically or conceptually, can be identified as separable from the utilitarian aspects of that article, the design would not be copyrighted under the bill. The test of separability and independence from \u201cthe utilitarian aspects of the article\u201d does not depend upon the nature of the design \u2014 that is, even if the appearance of an article is determined bv esthetic (as opposed to functional) considerations. only elements, if any, which can be identified separately from the useful article as such are copyrightable. And even if the three dimensional design contains some such element (for example, a carving on the back of a chair or a floral relief design on silver flatware), copyright protection would extend only to that element, and would not cover the over-all configuration of the utilitarian article as such.</blockquote>\n<p id=\"b877-14\">H.Rep. No. 1476, 94th Cong., 2d Sess. 55 (1976), U.S.Code Cong. &amp; Admin.News 1976, p. 5668 (emphasis added).</p>\n<p id=\"b877-15\">This excerpt is not entirely free from ambiguity. Esquire could arguably draw some support from the statement that a protectable element of a utilitarian article must be separable \u201cphysically <em>or conceptually\" </em>from the utilitarian aspects of the design. But any possible ambiguity raised <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"804\">*804</page-number>by this isolated reference disappears when the excerpt is considered in its entirety. The underscored passages indicate unequivocally that the overall design or configuration of a utilitarian object, even if it is determined by aesthetic as well as functional considerations, is not eligible for copyright. Thus the legislative history, taken as congressional understanding of existing law, reinforces the Register\u2019s position.</p>\n<p id=\"b878-4\">The legislative history of the 1976 Act also supports the Register\u2019s practice of ascribing little weight to the phrase \u201csole intrinsic function.\u201d As noted above, see TAN 11 <em>supra, </em>Esquire contends that as long as the overall shape of a utilitarian article embodies <em>dual </em>intrinsic functions\u2014 aesthetic and utilitarian \u2014 that shape may qualify for registration. But the new Act includes a definition of \u201cuseful article,\u201d referred to by the House Report as \u201can adaptation\u201d of the language of \u00a7 202.10(c), H.R. Rep. No. 1476, <em>supra </em>n.13, at 54, U.S.Code Cong. &amp; Admin.News 1976, p. 5668, which provides:</p>\n<blockquote id=\"b878-5\">A \u2018useful article\u2019 is an article having <em>an </em>intrinsic utilitarian function that is not merely to portray the appearance of the article or to convey information.</blockquote>\n<p id=\"b878-6\">17 U.S.C. \u00a7 101 (1976) (emphasis added). In deleting the modifier \u201csole\u201d from the language taken from \u00a7 202.10(c), the draftsmen of the 1976 Act must have concluded that the definition of \u201cuseful article\u201d would be more precise without this term. Moreover, Congress may have concluded that literal application of the phrase \u201csole intrinsic function\u201d would create an unworkable standard. For as one commentator has observed, \u201c[tjhere are no two-dimensional works and few three-dimensional objects whose design is absolutely dictated by utilitarian considerations.\u201d<footnotemark>25</footnotemark></p>\n<p id=\"b878-9\">C.</p>\n<p id=\"b878-10\">The district court basically ignored the foregoing considerations. Instead, it advanced two reasons for rejecting the Register\u2019s interpretation of \u00a7 202.10(c) as a matter of law. It concluded, first, that the Register\u2019s construction was inconsistent with the Supreme Court\u2019s decision in <em>Mazer v. Stein, </em>347 U.S. 201, 79 S.Ct. 141, 3 L.Ed.2d 132 (1954). Second, it found that the Register\u2019s interpretation amounted to impermissible discrimination against abstract modern art. We respectfully disagree on both counts.</p>\n<p id=\"b878-11\">We are unable to join in the district court\u2019s broad reading of <em>Mazer v. Stein, </em>supra<footnotemark>26</footnotemark> The principal issue in <em>Mazer </em>was whether objects that are concededly \u201cworks of art\u201d can be copyrighted if incorporated into mass-produced utilitarian articles. The Register had issued copyright certificates for the statuettes of Balinese dancing figures created with the intent to reproduce and sell them as bases for table lamps. The Court noted that the \u201clong-continued construction of the statutes\u201d by the Copyright Office permitted registration of the statuettes as \u201cworks of art.\u201d 347 U.S. at 213, 74 S.Ct. at 468. It then concluded that there was \u201cnothing in the copyright statute to support the argument that the intended use or use in industry of <em>an article eligible for copyright </em>bars or invalidates its registration.\u201d <em>Id. </em>at 218, 74 S.Ct. at 471 (emphasis added).</p>\n<p id=\"b878-12\">The issue here \u2014 whether the overall shape of a utilitarian object is \u201can article eligible for copyright\u201d \u2014 was not addressed in <em>Mazer. </em>In fact, under the Register\u2019s interpretation of \u00a7 202.10(c), the dancing figures considered in <em>Mazer </em>would clearly be copyrightable. The statuettes were undeniably capable of existing as a work of art independent of the utilitarian article into which they were incorporated. And <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"805\">*805</page-number>they were clearly a \u201cfeature\u201d segregable from the overall shape of the table lamps. There is thus no inconsistency between the copyright upheld in <em>Mazer </em>and the Register\u2019s interpretation of \u00a7 202.10(c) here.</p>\n<p id=\"b879-5\">The district court\u2019s second conclusion is somewhat more problematical. The court found, in effect, that that Register\u2019s interpretation of \u00a7 202.10(c) amounted to impermissible discrimination against designs that \u201cemphasize line and shape rather than the realistic or the ornate . . . 414 F.Supp. at 941.</p>\n<p id=\"b879-7\">We agree with the district court that the Copyright Act does not enshrine a particular conception of what constitutes \u201cart.\u201d <em>Id.</em><footnotemark><em>27</em></footnotemark><em> </em>As Justice Holmes noted in <em>Bleistein </em>v. <em>Donaldson Lithographing Co., </em>188 U.S. 239, 251, 23 S.Ct. 298, 300, 47 L.Ed. 460 (1903), \u201c[i]t would be a dangerous undertaking for persons trained only to the law to constitute themselves final judges of the worth of pictorial illustrations . . .\u201d Neither the Constitution nor the Copyright Act authorizes the Copyright Office or the federal judiciary to serve as arbiters of national taste. These officials have no particular competence to assess the merits of one genre of art relative to another. And to allow them to assume such authority would be to risk stultifying the creativity and originality the copyright laws were expressly designed to encourage. <em>Id. </em>at 251-52, 23 S.Ct. 298; <em>accord, Mazer v. Stein, supra </em>at 214, 79 S.Ct. 141.</p>\n<p id=\"b879-10\">But in our view the present case does not offend the nondiscrimination principle recognized in <em>Bleistein. Bleistein </em>was concerned only with conscious bias against one form of art \u2014 in that case the popular art reflected in circus posters. Esquire\u2019s complaint, in effect, is that the Register\u2019s interpretation of \u00a7 202.10(c) places an inadvertent burden on a particular form of art, .namely modern abstract sculpture. We may concede, for present purposes, that an interpretation of \u00a7 202.10(c) that bars copyright for the overall design or configuration of a utilitarian object will have a disproportionate impact on designs that exhibit the characteristics of abstract sculpture. But we can see no justification, at least in the circumstances of this case, for extending the nondiscrimination principle of <em>Bleistein </em>to include action having an unintentional, disproportionate impact on one style of artistic expression. Such an extension of the nondiscrimination principle would undermine other plainly legitimate goals of copyright law \u2014 in this case the congressional directive that copyright protection should not be afforded to industrial designs.</p>\n<p id=\"b879-16\">At oral argument, Esquire proposed for the first time a test which it claimed would respect the principle disfavoring the copyright of industrial designs, and yet would not impose a differential burden on modernistic art forms. Esquire suggested that the overall design or configuration of a utilitarian article should be copyrightable as a work of art if its shape is original and creative, and it exhibits \u201ca sufficient quantity of intellectual labor\u201d to distinguish it from everyday industrial designs. However, Esquire was unable to cite any authority in support of this proposed test. Moreover, such a test would pose obvious administrative difficulties, and would appear to thrust the Copyright Office and the courts into the very role Esquire argues so forcefully against \u2014 as overseers of the relative \u201cworth\u201d or value of different forms of art. Accordingly, we find no basis for requiring the Register to consider Esquire\u2019s belated suggestion.</p>\n<p id=\"b879-17\">III.</p>\n<p id=\"b879-18\">Given that the Register adopted an appropriate interpretation of \u00a7 202.10(c), the question remains whether the regulation was properly applied to the materials presented by Esquire\u2019s copyright claims. In general, the Copyright Act \u201cestablishes a <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"806\">*806</page-number>wide range of selection within which discretion must be exercised by the Register in determining what he has no power to accept.\u201d <em>Bouve v. Twentieth Century-Fox Film Corp., supra </em>74 U.S.App.D.C. at 273, 122 F.2d at 53; <em>accord, </em>Op. Att\u2019y Gen., 183 U.S.P.Q. 624, 628 (1974); 30 Op. Att\u2019y Gen. 422, 424 (1915). Here, the application of the regulation to the facts presented by Esquire\u2019s copyright applications unquestionably involved the exercise of administrative discretion.<footnotemark>28</footnotemark></p>\n<p id=\"b880-4\">When the question of the application of the regulation was raised at oral argument, Esquire took the position that its copyright applications should be read as requesting registration for only <em>part </em>of a utilitarian object. Specifically, Esquire maintained that it sought registration for the <em>housing </em>of each fixture, not for the design of the entire lighting assembly \u2014 including base, housing, electrical fixture, and light bulb. But Esquire\u2019s applications were not so limited. Each characterized the work for which registration was sought as an \u201cartistic design for lighting fixtures.\u201d<footnotemark>29</footnotemark> The photographs accompanying the applications portrayed both housings and bases for the lighting fixtures. No lesser feature was singled out as being that for which registration was sought. On the basis of these submissions, the Register could quite reasonably conclude that Esquire was claiming a copyright for the overall design of its outdoor lighting fixtures. The denial of registration in these circumstances did not amount to an abuse of discretion.</p>\n<p id=\"b880-7\">For the aforesaid reasons, the decision of the district court is</p>\n<p id=\"APW\">\n<em>Reversed.</em>\n</p>\n<footnote label=\"1\">\n<p id=\"b872-15\">. Joint Appendix (J.A.) at 4, 8, 12.</p>\n</footnote>\n<footnote label=\"2\">\n<p id=\"b872-16\">.

First, in the case of some utilitarian objects, like scissors or paper clips, shape is mandated by function. If one manufacturer were given the copyright to the design of such an article, it could completely prevent others from producing the same article. Second, consumer preference sometimes demands uniformity of shape for certain utilitarian articles, like stoves for instance. People simply expect and desire certain everyday useful articles to look the same particular way. Thus, to give one manufacturer the monopoly on such a shape would also be anticompetive [sic]. Third, insofar as geometric shapes are concerned, there are only a limited amount of basic shapes, such as circles, squares, rectangles and ellipses. These shapes are obviously in the public domain and accordingly it would be unfair to grant a monopoly on the use of any particular such shape, no matter how aesthetically well it was integrated into a utilitarian article.</blockquote>\n<p id=\"b875-15\">Brief for Appellant at 18-19. <em>See also </em>Note, <em>Protection for the Artistic Aspects of Articles of </em>Utility, 72 Harv.L.Rev. 1520, 1532 (1959).</p>\n</footnote>\n<footnote label=\"16\">\n<p id=\"b875-16\">.

Traditionally, of course, the writ of mandamus is not available to review nonministerial, discretionary decisions. <em>See, </em>e. <em>g., Panama Canal Co. v. Grace Line, Inc., </em>356 U.S. 309, 318, 78 S.Ct. 752, 2 L.Ed.2d 788 (1958). Recently, however, a number of courts have indicated that even discretionary decisions may be set aside under the mandamus statute, 28 U.S.C. \u00a7 1361, if they fall outside the bounds of \u201cany rational exercise of discretion.\u201d <em>United States v. Commanding Office, Armed Forces, </em>403 F.2d 371, 374 (2d Cir. 1968), <em>cert. denied, </em>394 U.S. 929, 89 S.Ct. 1195, 22 L.Ed.2d 460 (1969); accord, <em>Miller v. Ackerman, </em>488 F.2d 920, 922 (8th Cir. 1973); <em>Lovallo v. Froehlke, </em>468 F.2d 340, 346 (2d Cir. 1972). The interpretation of 28 U.S.C. \u00a7 1361 supported by the concurrence would extend mandamus jurisdiction one step further, and implies that mandamus is appropriate whenever, under \u00a7 10 of the Administrative Procedure Act, 5 U.S.C. \u00a7 706, a discretionary decision is \u201carbitrary, capricious, an abuse of discretion, or otherwise not in accordance with law.\u201d <em>See Peoples v. United States Dept. of Agriculture, </em>138 U.S.App.D.C. 291, 295, 427 F.2d 561, 565 (1970). The possible distinctions between these standards, and the considerations relevant to which should apply, were neither briefed nor argued. Nor is it necessary to resolve these questions here, for it is abundantly clear that under any standard the Register\u2019s application of \u00a7 202.10(c) did not constitute an abuse of discretion.</p>\n<p id=\"b880-10\">We do not question that in appropriate circumstances, the denial of registration may be reviewed in the district court in an action in the nature of mandamus. Indeed, as noted earlier, (see n.7 supra) mandamus would be an appropriate remedy where federal officials are acting contrary to their own regulations. Other copyright cases have presented situations where jurisdiction was found to lie under mandamus. <em>See, e. g., Bouve v. Twentieth Century-Fox Film Corp., </em>74 U.S.App.D.C. 271, 122 F.2d 51 (1941); <em>Hoffenberg v. Kaminstein, </em>130 U.S. App.D.C. 35, 396 F.2d 684, <em>cert. denied, </em>393 U.S. 913, 89 S.Ct. 235, 21 L.Ed.2d 199 (1968). <em>But cf. Public Affairs Associates, Inc. v.

Under the old Act, an infringement suit could not be brought until registration had been obtained. <em>Vacheron &amp; Constatin-Le Coultre Watches, Inc. v. Benrus Watch Co., </em>260 F.2d 637 (2d Cir. 1958). Under the 1976 Copyright Act, however, an infringement action may be brought after applying for registration, even if registration has been denied. 17 U.S.C. \u00a7 411 (1976). In such an infringement suit the court would then review the denial of registration. <em>Id. See </em>H.R. Rep.

I also concur in Judge Bazelon\u2019s opinion which I understand to hold that the provision of the Copyright Act limiting design copyright protection to \u201cworks of art,\u201d 17 U.S.C. \u00a7 5(g) (1976), authorizes the issuance <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"807\">*807</page-number>of the pertinent Copyright Office regulations, 37 C.F.R. \u00a7 202.10(c) (1977), and that both statute and regulations may be interpreted to preclude registration (a) of the design of a useful article, however aesthetically valuable, and (b) of any elements of the design unless they can be identified separately from the utilitarian aspects of the design. Esquire contends that the restrictive passage of section 202.10(c), which refers to situations where \u201cthe sole intrinsic function of an article is its utility,\u201d must be read narrowly, so as to make the prohibition on registration inapplicable where an article possesses from the outset not only utility but an aesthetically original and pleasing design form. I join in the rejection of that contention. Form follows function, in the credo of one school of art. Yet the overall legislative policy against monopoly for industrial design sustains the Copyright Office in its effort to distinguish between the instances where the aesthetic element is conceptually severable and the instances where the aesthetic element is inextricably interwoven with the utilitarian aspect of the article.</p>\n<p id=\"b881-5\">I add a word to note that Judge Bazelon\u2019s opinion reflects the court\u2019s premise that the district court had jurisdiction of this action even though Esquire requested issuance of a writ of mandamus to the Register of Copyrights.</p>\n<p id=\"b881-6\">The courts have issued mandatory instructions to federal officials notwithstanding the wording of Federal Rule of Civil Procedure 81(b), which by its terms abolishes the writ of mandamus in the federal district courts.<footnotemark>1</footnotemark> The rule permits equivalent relief, and the courts have issued orders that \u201cfor brevity, we may still speak of as . \u2018mandamus.\u2019 \u201d<footnotemark>2</footnotemark></p>\n<p id=\"b881-12\">The Mandamus and Venue Act of 1962, 28 U.S.C. \u00a7 1361 (1970), authorizes district courts generally to issue writs of mandamus to federal officials and \u201cto issue appropriate corrective orders where Federal officials are not acting within the zone of their permissible discretion but are abusing their discretion or otherwise acting contrary to law.\u201d<footnotemark>3</footnotemark> Although 28 U.S.C \u00a7 1361 applies only in case of a \u201cduty owed to plaintiff,\u201d it is not bounded by the hoary strictures of old mandamus law.</p>\n<p id=\"b881-13\">Apart from an action in mandamus, which may retain residual rigidity, there is jurisdiction to provide declaratory relief under the 1976 amendment to 28 U.S.C. \u00a7 1331. That eliminated the jurisdictional amount requirement for any federal question in an \u201caction brought against the United States, any agency thereof, or any officer or employee thereof in his official capacity.\u201d Now section 1331 broadly confers jurisdiction on federal courts to review agency action \u201csubject only to preclusion-of-review statutes created or retained by Congress.\u201d <em>Califano v. Sanders, </em>430 U.S. 99, 105, 97 S.Ct. 980, 984, 51 L.Ed.2d 192 (1977). Regulations implementing federal statutes have the \u201cforce and effect of law\u201d<footnotemark>4</footnotemark> <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"808\">*808</page-number>and cases arising under them are cases arising \u201cunder . laws ... of the United States.\u201d 28 U.S.C. \u00a7 1331(a) (1970).<footnotemark>5</footnotemark></p>\n<p id=\"b882-4\">As Judge Bazelon\u2019s opinion notes (fn. 28) the 1976 revision of the Copyright Act permits a copyright claimant to bring an infringement action even though the copyright has not been registered. 17 U.S.C. \u00a7 411 (1976). That statutory provision permits review of the Register\u2019s negative decision, and gives the Register an option to intervene. But the Copyright Act requires an infringement, and the claimant may wish to seek prior relief, <em>i. </em>e., to obtain the copyright registration, precisely in order to avoid the infringement and its disastrous business consequences.<footnotemark>6</footnotemark></p>\n<p id=\"b882-5\">As for litigation involving details of application of a regulation, the Register of Copyrights has broad discretion. In this case, as Judge Bazelon points out, the application of the regulation to the facts involved the exercise of administrative discretion, and the denial of registration in the circumstances did not amount to an abuse of discretion. The subject-matter of copyrights is such as to suggest that rarely if ever will a ruling denying an application for copyright on the basis of the application of a regulation be considered a contravention of a duty owed to the applicant. There is jurisdiction but no large likelihood of successful invocation.</p>\n<footnote label=\"1\">\n<p id=\"b881-7\">. <em>See </em>K.

Prior to 1962 the District Court of the District of Columbia was the only federal court that had authority, by virtue of its general equity jurisdiction, to issue a writ against a federal official.

United States, </em>371 U.S. 245, 83 S.Ct. 426, 9 L.Ed.2d 292 (1963), holding that Armed Services Procurement Regulation requiring competitive bidding has \u201cthe force of law\u201d and overrides California\u2019s minimum price regulation of milk insofar as it purported to regulate sales of milk to military installations. Thus regulations <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"808\">*808</page-number>were federal law for purposes of the Supremacy Clause. In 1963 the Court of Claims held that although the standard termination-for-convenience clause had been omitted from a contract, it would be deemed part of the procurement agreement since its inclusion was required by regulation, which had the \u201cforce of law.\u201d G.

That case involved an attempt by a Honduran corporation to enjoin a Regional Director of the NLRB from conducting a representation election on a Honduran registered vessel. In holding that the controversy was one \u201carising under\u201d federal law, Judge Friendly observed:</p>\n<blockquote id=\"AAx\">it would run counter both to the language and to the policy underlying [28 U.S.C. \u00a7 1337] to hold that the jurisdictional grant did not include an action whose sole purpose is to challenge an order of a Federal agency sought to be justified by a Federal statute.</blockquote>\n<p id=\"AAW\">300 F.2d at 226-27.</p>\n</footnote>\n<footnote label=\"6\">\n<p id=\"b882-21\">.
