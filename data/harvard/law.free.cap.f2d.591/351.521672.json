We take occasion to reiterate that, under <em>Lundy v. Osborn, </em>555 F.2d 534 (5th Cir. 1977), the proper disposition of such petitions as Wade\u2019s is dismissal for failure to exhaust the administrative remedies provided by Bureau of Prisons Policy Statement 2001.-6A. Since the court below erroneously reached the merits of Wade\u2019s claim, however, and since many of the considerations underlying the decision of the court en banc in <em>Galtieri v. Wainwright, </em>582 F.2d 348 (5th Cir. 1978), are presented here as well \u2014 notably those of judicial economy \u2014 we have surveyed the claim\u2019s merits and find them absent.</p>\n<p id=\"b425-14\">DENIED.</p>\n</opinion>\n</casebody>\n",
