Kelleher, United States District Judge for the Central District of California, sitting by designation.</p>\n</footnote>\n<opinion data-order=\"8\" data-type=\"opinion\" id=\"x999-2\" type=\"majority\">\n<author id=\"b131-9\">DUNIWAY, Circuit Judge:</author>\n<p id=\"b131-10\">The National Labor Relations Board seeks enforcement of its order requiring the California Inspection Rating Bureau to bargain with the Professional and Clerical Employees, Division of Teamsters Local 856, as the representative of certain of the Bureau\u2019s employees.</p>\n<p id=\"b131-11\">The Union won a Board conducted representation election, and the Bureau then refused to bargain with the Union in order to assert its defenses. These are (1) that the Bureau, which is now called Workers\u2019 Compensation Insurance Rating Bureau, is a \u201cpolitical subdivision\u201d of the state of California, within the meaning of \u00a7 2(2) of the National Labor Relations Act as amended, (29 U.S.C. \u00a7 152(2)), and so exempt from the provisions of the Act, and (2), alternatively, that the Bureau\u2019s operations are so intimately connected with the State as to require the Board to decline jurisdiction over the Bureau.</p>\n<p id=\"b131-12\">These defenses were first asserted by the Bureau in opposition to the Union\u2019s petition for an election, and were carefully considered by the Board and rejected in a Decision and Direction of Election reported at 215 NLRB 780 (1974). The same defenses were again considered in a Decision and Order in the refusal to bargain case reported at 225 NLRB 870 (1976) and in a Supplemental Decision and Order in that case reported at 231 NLRB No. 75, (1977).</p>\n<p id=\"b131-14\">We are satisfied that the Board\u2019s findings of fact are fully supported by substantial evidence upon the record considered as a whole. The Board correctly applied the principles stated by the Court in <em>NLRB v. Natural Gas Utility District of Hawkins County, Tennessee, </em>1971, 402 U.S. 600, 602-605, 91 S.Ct. 1746, 29 L.Ed.2d 206, in rejecting the Bureau\u2019s first defense. <em>See also, NLRB </em>v. <em>Natchez Trace Electric Power Ass\u2019n, 5 </em>Cir., 1973, 476 F.2d 1042; <em>NLRB v. Randolph Electric Membership Corporation, </em>4 Cir., 1965, 343 F.2d 60. The Board had jurisdiction over the Bureau for the reasons stated by the Board in its Decisions.</p>\n<p id=\"b131-15\">The Board has considerable discretion in deciding whether or not to exercise jurisdiction that it has. <em>NLRB v. W. B. Jones Lumber Co., </em>9 Cir., 1957, 245 F.2d 388, 390-91. For the reasons stated by the Board in its Decisions, we conclude that that discretion was not abused, and that the Board\u2019s decision to exercise its jurisdiction \u201chas a reasonable basis in the evidence and is not inconsistent with the law.\u201d <em>NLRB v. E. C. Atkins &amp; Co., </em>1947, 331 U.S. 398, 403, 67 S.Ct. 1265, 91 L.Ed. 1563.</p>\n<p id=\"b131-16\">The Board\u2019s order will be enforced.</p>\n</opinion>\n</casebody>\n",
