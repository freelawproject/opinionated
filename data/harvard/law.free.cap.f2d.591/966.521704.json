ROBINSON, III, Circuit Judge:</author>\n<p id=\"b1042-10\">Ronald T. Phillips is one of a number of paralegal staff assistants employed by the National Prison Project, an organization engaged in the provision of legal services to prisoners.<footnotemark>1</footnotemark> The duties assigned Project paralegals include interviewing prisoners who are witnesses in pending cases or present or prospective clients of attorneys associated with the Project. Envisioning this role for Phillips, himself a former federal prisoner, the Project sought permission from the Bureau of Prisons for Phillips to enter federal penal institutions for the purpose of conducting such interviews.<footnotemark>2</footnotemark> By letter, the Bureau promptly denied the Project\u2019s request.<footnotemark>3</footnotemark></p>\n<p id=\"b1042-19\">Shortly thereafter, this litigation was launched in the District Court by Phillips, the Project and its executive director, and three federal inmates who are clients of the Project.<footnotemark>4</footnotemark> Characterizing Phillips\u2019 exclusion as arbitrary, their complaint demanded declaratory and injunctive relief. The court, deeming the Bureau\u2019s action \u201ca reasonable exercise of . discretion,\u201d dismissed the suit for lack of a claim upon which relief could be granted,<footnotemark>5</footnotemark> whereupon this appeal was taken.<footnotemark>6</footnotemark></p>\n<p id=\"b1042-21\">We are mindful that \u201ca complaint should not be dismissed for failure to state a claim unless it appears beyond doubt that the plaintiff can prove no set of facts in support of his claim which would entitle him to relief.\u201d <footnotemark>7</footnotemark> We think, however, that stringent standard has been met here and, accordingly, we affirm the judgment of dismissal.</p>\n<p id=\"b1043-3\"><page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"969\">*969</page-number>I. THE FACTUAL BACKGROUND</p>\n<p id=\"b1043-4\">The posture of the case constrained the District Court \u2014 as it does us \u2014 to accept the truth of the well-pleaded factual allegations of the complaint.<footnotemark>8</footnotemark> We are mindful, too, that when passing on a motion attacking the legal efficacy of the plaintiff\u2019s statement of his claim, the court may properly look beyond the complaint only to items in the record of the case or to matters of general public record.<footnotemark>9</footnotemark> We accordingly confine ourselves largely to the contents of the complaint, including prominently the text of the Bureau\u2019s letter-decision incorporated therein,<footnotemark>10</footnotemark> in distilling the factual predicate for resolution of this appeal.</p>\n<p id=\"b1043-5\">In responding to the Project\u2019s request on Phillips\u2019 behalf, the Bureau emphasized that it had no general policy of automatically excluding ex-offenders from paralegal activity inside federal prisons.<footnotemark>11</footnotemark> On the contrary, the Bureau declared, each such application is considered on its own merits.<footnotemark>12</footnotemark> Phillips was refused permission, the Bureau said, principally because of his disciplinary record during his seven years of federal incarceration.<footnotemark>13</footnotemark> While confined, Phillips had taken part in several serious institutional disturbances, playing a leadership role in at least two of them.<footnotemark>14</footnotemark> These incidents included an attempt to incite a work stoppage, encouraging and engaging in other group demonstrations, endeavoring to introduce contraband into a segregation unit, threatening bodily harm, and \u201cfighting, refusing orders, and possession of a stolen radio.\u201d<footnotemark>15</footnotemark> In the Bureau\u2019s view, this history revealed Phillips as \u201cdisruptive and a poor influence on other inmates,\u201d<footnotemark>16</footnotemark> and por<page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"970\">*970</page-number>trayed a relevant \u201ccourse of conduct\u201d which the Bureau could not \u201cresponsibly ignore.\u201d <footnotemark>17</footnotemark></p>\n<p id=\"b1044-4\">The complaint recounted, without controverting in any manner, this recitation of Phillips\u2019 record as a federal inmate. This may be explained by appellants\u2019 consistent position that Phillips\u2019 past should be irrelevant to determination of whether he should be granted entry into federal prisons, and that only his post-release record should be considered.<footnotemark>18</footnotemark> The Bureau responds by noting that when the Project\u2019s request was acted on Phillips had been paroled only three months earlier<footnotemark>19</footnotemark> and therefore that his prison record was a necessary determinant in their predictive decision to deny him access in order to safeguard order and discipline in the institutions under their charge.</p>\n<p id=\"b1044-5\">Appellants complained to the District Court that the Bureau\u2019s decision trespassed on rights secured to them by the Constitution. We examine, in turn, each of their several claims and \u2014 as we are obliged to do<footnotemark>20</footnotemark> \u2014 such additional theories of recovery that the factual averments of their complaint might support. In the end, we conclude that none can prevail.</p>\n<p id=\"b1044-6\">II. PHILLIPS\u2019 CLAIMS</p>\n<p id=\"b1044-7\">Phillips maintains that the Bureau\u2019s decision deprived him of liberty and property without due process of law in violation of the Fifth Amendment. He asserts that the Bureau\u2019s action was taken without reference to any established standard. He insists, too, that it was arbitrary because unaccompanied by any showing that he actually presented a threat to prison security.<footnotemark>21</footnotemark></p>\n<p id=\"b1044-13\">A. <em>The Right Involved</em></p>\n<p id=\"A8b\">It cannot be gainsaid that Phillips enjoys an interest in the pursuit of his newly-found vocation commanding a measure of constitutional protection. His want is to function as a paralegal, and he has manifested an interest in working with prisoners, many of whom, of course, are kept in federal facilities. No one can deny that \u201cthe right to hold specific private employment and to follow a chosen profession free from unreasonable governmental interference comes within the \u2018liberty\u2019 and \u2018property\u2019 concepts of the Fifth Amendment ..\u201d<footnotemark>22</footnotemark> To be sure, the right to ply the paralegal\u2019s trade does not per se entail a concomitant right to freely enter federal prisons to do so; the Bureau need not afford opportunities to realize one\u2019s occupational aspirations.<footnotemark>23</footnotemark> But the Bureau may not capriciously foreclose to particular individuals opportunities that it has previously and independently created generally for others.<footnotemark>24</footnotemark></p>\n<p id=\"b1045-4\"><page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"971\">*971</page-number>A critical factor in our present analysis is that paralegals ordinarily may enter federal penal institutions for conferences with inmates related to legal business. The Bureau has a long-standing policy<footnotemark>25</footnotemark> of extending visitation privileges liberally to attorneys.<footnotemark>26</footnotemark> Paralegals, treated identically<footnotemark>27</footnotemark> save for required supervision by an attorney,<footnotemark>28</footnotemark> are \u201croutinely granted access to federal prisoners.\u201d <footnotemark>29</footnotemark> Indeed, visits of all sorts are encouraged except when their denial becomes \u201cnecessary to insure the security, good order, and discipline of the institution.\u201d <footnotemark>30</footnotemark> Hence, \u201cconsistent, positive action of government officials\u201d has created.\u201ca justifiable expectation that the only basis for the government\u2019s ref\u00fasal to grant\u201d<footnotemark>31</footnotemark> entrance is concern for internal security, order and discipline.<footnotemark>32</footnotemark> Put another way, \u201crules or mutually explicit understandings\u201d<footnotemark>33</footnotemark> have given rise to a \u201clegitimate claim of entitlement.\u201d <footnotemark>34</footnotemark> Phillips has alleged facts making out this much, and it is too early in the litigation to be certain that he is wrong.</p>\n<p id=\"b1045-12\">B. <em>The Balance of Interests</em></p>\n<p id=\"b1045-13\">Nonetheless, while we believe that paralegals enjoy the safeguard of due process for. their general entitlement to enter federal prisons to function as such, we are satisfied that the Bureau\u2019s decision to exclude Phillips was faithful to a constitutionally permissible standard and was reached by constitutionally acceptable means. And we reject the suggestion that the Bureau must demonstrate that Phillips, if admitted, <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"972\">*972</page-number>would actually upset institutional tranquility-</p>\n<p id=\"b1046-4\">The Bureau\u2019s decision made reasonably clear that Phillips was refused ingress because his prison record disclosed his disruptive proclivities and led Bureau officials to consider him a serious threat to the stability of conditions essential to prison security.<footnotemark>35</footnotemark> The Bureau\u2019s governing standard\u2014 that paralegals may be kept out when that is adjudged necessary to insure discipline and good order<footnotemark>36</footnotemark> \u2014 strikes us as definite as protection of the governmental interest, involving as it does a predictive determination, permits, and is sufficiently precise to satisfy constitutional demands.<footnotemark>37</footnotemark> As the Supreme Court has acknowledged, \u201c[bjecause the realities of running a penal institution are complex and difficult, we have . . . recognized the wide-ranging deference to be accorded the decisions of prison administrators.\u201d<footnotemark>38</footnotemark> And as the Court has underscored, \u201ccentral to all other corrections goals is the institutional consideration of internal security within the corrections facilities themselves.\u201d<footnotemark>39</footnotemark> In sum, the judiciary is duty bound to uphold the reasonable judgments of responsible officials on that score.<footnotemark>40</footnotemark></p>\n<p id=\"b1046-12\">Phillips argues, however, that the Bureau\u2019s failure to <em>demonstrate </em>that he would disrupt order and discipline in federal facilities to which he might be admitted as a paralegal renders his exclusion constitutionally infirm.<footnotemark>41</footnotemark> This position misallocates the burden of proof. Nothing in the Constitution compelled the Bureau, in order to sustain its decision to exclude Phillips, to prove to the satisfaction of a judge that he actually posed a threat to prison security. As the Supreme Court has declared, \u201c[t]he necessary and correct result of [judicial] deference to the informed discretion of prison administrators permits them, not the courts, to make the difficult judgments concerning institutional operations in situations <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"973\">*973</page-number>such as this.\u201d<footnotemark>42</footnotemark> Consequently, a \u201cfurther requirement of a demonstrable showing that [Phillips] was in fact harmful is inconsistent with the deference federal courts should pay to the informed discretion of prison officials.\u201d<footnotemark>43</footnotemark> Concededly, the Bureau\u2019s decision would be vulnerable were it arbitrary or patently unreasonable.<footnotemark>44</footnotemark> But at no time has Phillips pleaded or even suggested facts that might serve to indicate that such is the case.<footnotemark>45</footnotemark></p>\n<p id=\"b1047-5\">Phillips has not questioned the sufficiency of the procedures by which he was refused access to federal penal institutions. Nonetheless, our duty to accord his complaint a liberal reading and to consider all legal theories his factual allegations might conceivably support<footnotemark>46</footnotemark> leads us to inquire in that regard. We start with the proposition that \u201cnotice to the unsuccessful applicant of the factual bases for denial with an opportunity to rebut is a minimum prerequisite for ensuring that the denial\u201d <footnotemark>47</footnotemark> is in furtherance of the interest in preserving prison order rather than based on some arbitrary or unacceptable reason. The Bureau\u2019s letter-decision satisfied the first mandate, and we are persuaded that the second also has been met. The Bureau has made clear that it was open to further submissions, either by Phillips or the Project, that might rebut the factual predicates for the decision.<footnotemark>48</footnotemark> Neither ever sought a fuller hearing by the Bureau, nor has Phillips claimed that he was precluded from presenting to the Bureau any favorable information he might have.<footnotemark>49</footnotemark> Indeed, never \u2014 either to the Bureau, the District Court or this court \u2014 has Phillips even suggested that the Bureau\u2019s characterization of his prison record is inaccurate. We recognize that the Bureau is legally required to supply a statement of reasons explaining any denial of access after rebuttal material has been put forward.<footnotemark>50</footnotemark> Because, however, <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"974\">*974</page-number>neither Phillips nor, the Project sought to provide the Bureau with any such information, this requirement was never called into play.<footnotemark>51</footnotemark></p>\n<p id=\"b1048-4\">III. CLAIMS OF THE OTHER APPELLANTS</p>\n<p id=\"b1048-5\">A. <em>Resort to the Courts</em></p>\n<p id=\"b1048-6\">The appellant inmates assert that the ban on Phillips\u2019 paralegal services in federal correctional institutions deprives them of their constitutional right to resort to the courts.<footnotemark>52</footnotemark> To be sure, the Due Process Clauses insure to prisoners,<footnotemark>53</footnotemark> federal and state, \u201cmeaningful access\u201d<footnotemark>54</footnotemark> to the courts for the presentation of their legal grievances.<footnotemark>55</footnotemark> But this does not mean that paralegals must automatically be admitted into penal institutions, for governmental officials are free to adopt any of several methods to achieve the constitutional goal.<footnotemark>56</footnotemark> Beyond that, \u201c[t]he extent to which [the right of access of the courts] is burdened by a particular regulation or practice must be weighed against the legitimate interests of penal administration and the proper regard that judges should give to the expertise and discretionary authority of correctional officials.\u201d <footnotemark>57</footnotemark></p>\n<p id=\"b1048-15\">Plainly, we cannot rule that prisoners have a constitutional right to communicate face-to-face with a paralegal who officially and not unreasonably has been determined to be a danger to prison order. The claim of that right fails here for precisely the same reasons denuding the claim of a correlative right by Phillips himself.<footnotemark>58</footnotemark> The governmental interest in prison security is equally strong in both instances, as is the obligation of judicial deference.<footnotemark>59</footnotemark> Furthermore, the decision under attack, excluding as it does but a single paralegal from federal prisons, in no way suggests that federal inmates do not enjoy alternative means of access to the courts just as suitable.<footnotemark>60</footnotemark> Other paralegals, perhaps even some who are ex-offenders, as well as members of the bar, remain available to assist these appellants in pursuing their legal remedies. The balance of interests thus leans heavily and decisively on the side of the Bureau.</p>\n<p id=\"b1048-16\">B. <em>Freedom of Speech and Association</em></p>\n<p id=\"b1048-17\">The prisoner-appellants also suggest that the Bureau\u2019s action unconstitu<page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"975\">*975</page-number>tionally abridged their speech and associational liberties secured by the First Amendment.<footnotemark>61</footnotemark> The intended purpose of Phillips\u2019 proposed excursions into federal prisons is to interview witnesses and present or prospective clients of Project attorneys \u2014 contacts implicating speech and association for both Phillips and the inmates involved.<footnotemark>62</footnotemark> We cannot believe, however, that these ingredients of the interview serve to elevate the prior entry into the prison complex to the status of a First Amendment right inhering in either.</p>\n<p id=\"b1049-5\">An act does not necessarily take on characteristics invoking the First Amendment simply because if taken it may usher in another episode plainly possessing First Amendment elements. This is neatly illustrated by the Supreme Court\u2019s disposition in <em>Zemel v. </em>Rusk<footnotemark>63</footnotemark> of a claim that denial of a validated passport for travel to Cuba directly interfered with the would-be traveler\u2019s ability to learn first-hand the effects abroad of American policies and the conditions abroad that might affect those policies. The Court explained:</p>\n<blockquote id=\"b1049-6\">We must agree that the Secretary\u2019s refusal to validate passports for Cuba renders less than wholly free the flow of information concerning that country. While we further agree that this is a factor to be considered in determining whether appellant has been denied due process of law, we cannot accept the contention of appellant that it is a First Amendment right which is involved. For to the extent that the Secretary\u2019s refusal to validate passports for Cuba acts as an inhibition (and it would be unrealistic to assume that it does not), it is an inhibition of action. There are few restrictions on action which could not be clothed by ingenious argument in the garb of decreased data flow. For example, the prohibition of unauthorized entry into the White House diminishes the citizen\u2019s opportunities to gather information he might find relevant to his opinion of the way the country is being run, but that does not make entry into the White House a First Amendment right. The right to speak and publish does not carry with it the unrestrained right to gather information.<footnotemark>64</footnotemark></blockquote>\n<p id=\"b1049-12\">Withholding of permission to come into a federal prison, no less than refusal of a validated passport to Cuba or of admission to the White House, is \u201can inhibition of action.\u201d And no more than travel to Cuba <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"976\">*976</page-number>or entry into the White House to augment one\u2019s store of information does Phillips\u2019 anticipated face-to-face consultation with an inmate \u201cmake entry into\u201d a federal penal facility \u201ca First Amendment right.\u201d<footnotemark>65</footnotemark> Concisely put, there is no \u201cFirst Amendment easement\u201d<footnotemark>66</footnotemark> along which Phillips can wend his way inside the prison walls. To boot, \u201c[t]he fact of confinement and the needs of the penal institution impose limitations on constitutional rights, including those derived from the First Amendment, which are implicit in incarceration; \u201d<footnotemark>67</footnotemark> and \u201cchallenges to prison restrictions that are asserted to inhibit First Amendment interests must be analyzed in terms of the legitimate policies and goals of the corrections system, to whose custody and care the prisoner has been committed in accordance with due process of law.\u201d<footnotemark>68</footnotemark> Moreover, the availability of alternative means of communication is a relevant factor when a court is called upon to balance the First Amendment rights of prisoners against the legitimate governmental interests served by particular restrictions on those liberties.<footnotemark>69</footnotemark> The Bureau\u2019s standard excluding paralegals like Phillips is tailored to serve an important governmental interest,<footnotemark>70</footnotemark> and other avenues of communicating with Phillips \u2014 such as the mail \u2014 remain fully available.<footnotemark>71</footnotemark> We conclude that the inmates\u2019 First Amendment claim is insubstantial.</p>\n<p id=\"b1050-10\">C. <em>Practice of Law</em></p>\n<p id=\"b1050-11\">Lastly, the Project and its executive director, who is an attorney, charge that Phillips\u2019 exclusion from federal penal facilities unconstitutionally interferes with their right to practice law.<footnotemark>72</footnotemark> Charitably construed, this contention amounts to an assertion that the procedures by which Phillips was denied access were deficient and consequently that Project attorneys were deprived of a constitutionally protected liberty or property interest through loss of his services.<footnotemark>73</footnotemark> It is evident that the Bureau\u2019s action did not disable Project attorneys more than infinitesimally from engaging \u201cin any of the common occupations of life . .\u201d<footnotemark>74</footnotemark> And we have already held that the method by which the Bureau\u2019s decision was reached satisfied Fifth Amend<page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"977\">*977</page-number>ment requirements.<footnotemark>75</footnotemark> We think no more need be said on this aspect of the case.</p>\n<p id=\"b1051-5\">IV. CONCLUSION</p>\n<p id=\"b1051-6\">We hold today that appellants do not possess a constitutional right to compel the admittance into federal correctional facilities of a paralegal who in the considered judgment of prison officials constitutes a present, serious threat to institutional security. Insofar as appellants\u2019 claims rest on a challenge to the Bureau\u2019s characterization of Phillips as such a danger, they have failed because their complaint does not contain \u201ca ... statement showing that [they are] entitled to relief.\u201d<footnotemark>76</footnotemark> Because appellants have not sought leave to amend their complaint in either this court or the court below, this litigation draws to an end.<footnotemark>77</footnotemark> For the reasons elucidated above,<footnotemark>78</footnotemark> the judgment appealed from is</p>\n<p id=\"b1051-11\">\n<em>Affirmed.</em>\n</p>\n<footnote label=\"1\">\n<p id=\"b1042-11\">.

We are confronted at the threshold by the Bureau\u2019s argument that this controversy is nonjusticiable because the terms of Phillips\u2019 unexpired parole require him to obtain permission before leaving the area specified in his certificate of parole, a dispensation he has not procured. We need not reach the merits of the Bureau\u2019s legal thesis, however, for the record takes away its essential factual support.

However, this is not our primary concern. In your letter you indicate that Mr. Phillips\u2019 disciplinary record while he was a federal prisoner is \u201ctotally irrelevant.\u201d His disciplinary record while in custody is our major concern. It reveals a long history of disciplinary actions of a certain type. During the course of his imprisonment, he took part in three major institutional disturbances in three penitentiaries, and played a leadership role in two and maybe three of these. The first such disturbance occurred February 15, 1972, at Lewisburg Penitentiary. During this incident, Mr. Phillips led some 200 inmates in a work stoppage, and was subsequently found guilty by the discipline committee of attempting to incite a work stoppage. For his part in this disturbance he forfeited 30 days statutory good time, and the committee suspended the forfeiture of an additional 386 days. In May of 1972 Mr. Phillips and 10 other inmates went on a hunger strike and were removed from segregation to the hospital. On July 11, 1972, Mr. Phillips was transferred to the McNeil Island Penitentiary. Here on December 11, 1972, Mr. Phillips was charged with encouraging demonstrations and refusing to work. He admitted the latter. No good time was taken for this offense.</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b1043-15\">On February 12, 1973, Mr. Phillips received another incident report for attempting to introduce contraband into the segregation unit. He was transferred on February 15 to Leavenworth Penitentiary.</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b1043-16\">The third major misconduct report occurred at Leavenworth on October 11, 1973.

In part this policy is the product of various limitations on the scope of federal review of conditions in state penal institutions. More fundamentally, this attitude springs from complementary perceptions about the nature of the problems and the efficacy of judicial intervention. Prison administrators are responsible for maintaining internal order and discipline, for securing their institutions against unauthorized access or escape, and for rehabilitating, to the extent that human nature and inadequate resources allow, the inmates placed in their custody. The Herculean obstacles to effective discharge of these duties are too apparent to warrant explication. Suffice it to say that the problems of prisons in America are complex and intractable, and, more to the point, they are not readily susceptible of resolution by decree. Most require expertise, comprehensive planning, and the commitment of resources, all of which are peculiarly within the province of the legislative and executive branches of government. For all of those reasons, courts are ill equipped to deal with the increasingly urgent problems of prison administration and reform. Judicial recognition of that fact reflects no more than a healthy sense of realism.</blockquote>\n<p id=\"b1046-14\">(footnotes omitted).</p>\n</footnote>\n<footnote label=\"39\">\n<p id=\"b1046-15\">. <em>Pell v.
