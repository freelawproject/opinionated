The suit alleged intolerable living conditions in the Webb County jail in violation of the eighth amendment. After two years of litigation, the parties entered into a consent decree. This decree was approved and signed by the trial judge on July 29, 1976. The consent decree reserved the question of attorneys\u2019 fees, and on the same day, the trial court conducted a hearing to determine whether attorneys\u2019 fees were appropriate. Based upon existing law, the trial court entered a memorandum opinion on August 30, 1976, denying the plaintiffs\u2019 request for attorneys\u2019 fees.</p>\n<p id=\"b1161-15\">On October 19, 1976, the Civil Rights Attorneys\u2019 Fees Award Act of 1976 was signed into law. Pursuant to this legislation, the plaintiffs moved for reconsideration of their request for attorneys\u2019 fees. After a hearing the district court entered a memorandum opinion awarding attorneys\u2019 fees. The district court held:</p>\n<blockquote id=\"AMy\">the court\u2019s memorandum and order of August 30, 1976, was not a final judgment, since a judgment or order as to this issue was not set out on a separate document as required by F.R.Civ.P. Rule 58, and so it was not, and is not yet, a final appealable judgment. <em>Sassoon v. United States, </em>549 F.2d 983 (5 Cir. 1977).</blockquote>\n<p id=\"b1161-16\">After <em>Bankers Trust v. Mallis, </em>435 U.S. 381, 98 S.Ct. 1117, 55 L.Ed.2d 357 (1978), it is clear that a memorandum opinion will be considered a final judgment despite the district court\u2019s failure to follow the separate document requirement of Rule 58 F.R.Civ.P., if the district court intended the memorandum opinion to represent a final judgment and the parties treated it as such. 98 S.Ct. at 1121. Since the district court\u2019s memorandum opinion of August 30, 1976, disposed of all the issues raised by all of the parties and an order denying attor<page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"1088\">*1088</page-number>neys\u2019 fees was entered in the docket book, we conclude that the district court intended its memorandum opinion to be a final judgment. Certainly, there can be no doubt that the plaintiffs also considered the August 30, 1976, memorandum a final judgment, as their motion for reconsideration states that they did not appeal from the August 30, 1976, memorandum opinion because \u201csuch an appeal would have been frivolous and an abuse of the judicial process,\u201d in light of the extensive hearing and the \u201cwell-reasoned and legally correct conclusions entered by the Court.\u201d</p>\n<p id=\"b1162-4\">Given the Supreme Court\u2019s position in <em>Mallis, we </em>conclude that the district court erred in his conclusion that he retained jurisdiction to award attorneys\u2019 fees.</p>\n<p id=\"b1162-5\">Alternatively, the plaintiffs argue that even if the August 30, 1976, judgment was a final judgment, the district court was empowered under Rule 60(b) to reopen the attorneys\u2019 fees issue.</p>\n<p id=\"b1162-6\">We need not decide if Rule 60(b) F.R.Civ.P. empowers the district court to reopen the attorneys\u2019 fees issue because even if the court had power under this rule to reopen the issue, it erred in awarding attorneys\u2019 fees. Since plaintiffs were \u201cprevailing parties,\u201d they were entitled to attorneys\u2019 fees under the Act <em>if </em>their case was <em>pending </em>at the time the Act became law. <em>Hutto v. Finney, </em>437 U.S. 678, 98 S.Ct. 2565, 2576 n.23, 57 L.Ed.2d 522, 537 n.23 (1978); <em>Bradley v. Richmond School Board, </em>416 U.S. 696, 715-16, 94 S.Ct. 2006, 40 L.Ed.2d 476 (1973); <em>Morrow v. Dillard, </em>580 F.2d 1284, 1300-01 (5 Cir. 1978). At the time the Act became law there were no issues pending before the district court.<footnotemark>1</footnotemark> <em>See Henry v. Clarksdale Municipal School District, </em>579 F.2d 916, 918-19 (5 Cir. 1978); <em>Peacock v. Drew Municipal Separate School District, </em>433 F.Supp. 1072, 1075-76 (N.D.Miss.1977).</p>\n<p id=\"b1162-8\">We therefore conclude that the district court erred in awarding attorneys\u2019 fees.</p>\n<p id=\"b1162-9\">REVERSED.</p>\n<footnote label=\"1\">\n<p id=\"b1162-7\">. The plaintiffs\u2019 October 1, 1976, motion concerning the appellants\u2019 failure to comply with the consent decree is in the nature of a supplemental proceeding to effectuate the prior consent judgment and is insufficient to make a pending active issue. <em>See Peacock v. Drew Municipal Separate School District, supra.</em></p>\n</footnote>\n</opinion>\n</casebody>\n",
