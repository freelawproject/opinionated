ROBINSON, III, Circuit Judge,</author>\n<p id=\"AAbx\">was a member of this panel, but did not participate in the foregoing order.</p>\n<p id=\"b883-4\"><page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"809\">*809</page-number>MEMORANDUM</p>\n<p id=\"b883-5\">In the opinion of this Court, the District Court should have looked at the secret, <em>in camera </em>affidavit of Mr. Miller explaining why the disclosure of the two lines would cause extreme injury to his interest in personal privacy. While the District Court did have a document to examine (Mr. Miller\u2019s Standard Form 171), the two-line item on that form does not alone explain the reasons behind the claim of exemption under 5 U.S.C. \u00a7 552(b)(6). The only matter available to the court that would have enabled it to properly decide <em>de novo </em>the propriety of Miller\u2019s claim that the material was exempt from disclosure was the proffered <em>in camera </em>affidavit. Since the District Court has the duty to decide the case on the fullest offered record, it should not have refused to examine the affidavit. <em>See Phillippi v. Central Intelligence Agency, </em>178 U.S.App.D.C. 243, 246-247, 546 F.2d 1009, 1012-1013 (1976).</p>\n<p id=\"b883-6\">In addition, the language of 5 U.S.C. \u00a7 552(b)(6) . . would constitute a clearly unwarranted invasion of personal privacy\u201d has been interpreted by this Court as requiring a balancing of the interest in personal privacy against the public interest in disclosure. See <em>Rural Housing Alliance v. United States Dept. of Agr., </em>162 U.S.App.D.C. 122, 126-127, 498 F.2d 73, 77-78 (1974), and <em>Getman v. NLRB, </em>146 U.S.App.D.C. 209, 450 F.2d 670 (1971). Since this is a balancing test, any invasion of privacy can prevail, so long as the public interest balanced against it is sufficiently weaker. The threat to privacy thus need not be patent or obvious to be relevant. It need only outweigh the public interest.</p>\n</opinion>\n</casebody>\n",
