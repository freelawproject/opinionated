WRIGHT, Circuit Judge:</author>\n<p id=\"b1368-26\">Sanders was convicted under 18 U.S.C. \u00a7 495 (1976), for uttering a United States Treasury check, knowing that it was falsely endorsed. He appeals, contending: (1) that his second trial was barred by the double <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"1295\">*1295</page-number>jeopardy clause of the Fifth Amendment; (2) that he was denied due process because the district court would neither allow him to call a specific witness nor declare her unavailable so that her prior recorded testimony could be read into the record; and (3) that the court erred in admitting testimony of threats allegedly made by Sanders to a prosecution witness.</p>\n<p id=\"b1369-5\">Because we conclude that the conviction must be reversed on double jeopardy grounds, we do not reach the remaining issues.</p>\n<p id=\"b1369-6\">FACTS</p>\n<p id=\"b1369-7\">A jury was empaneled and sworn for Sanders\u2019 trial on May 1, 1978. Testimony was first taken on May 5. Three government witnesses testified that an unendorsed treasury check payable to Danny Hope disappeared from Hope\u2019s truck in Hardin, Montana; that Sanders was in Hardin at about that time; and that Sanders was photographed while cashing Hope\u2019s falsely endorsed check. The fourth prosecution witness, Rowena Standing Alone, testified that Sanders came to her home with the cheek and that after she, her former husband (Little Whiteman), and Kenneth Wolf-black refused to sign it, Sanders falsely endorsed the check.<footnotemark>1</footnotemark></p>\n<p id=\"b1369-8\">Defense counsel then asked Standing Alone to submit an example of her handwriting for expert comparison with the forged endorsement. She agreed, asserting that she had not endorsed the check. The court granted Sanders\u2019 motion for a continuance to May 12, 1978 to allow time for the handwriting analysis.</p>\n<p id=\"b1369-9\">When court reconvened, the judge announced to the jury that, because the results of the comparison suggested that Standing Alone probably had endorsed the cheek, she had been indicted for perjury and for forging the endorsement. He then declared a mistrial <em>sua sponte </em>over Sanders\u2019 objection</p>\n<blockquote id=\"b1369-11\">in the interest of justice ... so that at least in [the court\u2019s] mind there would be no prejudice as far as the defendant is concerned with a new jury, having testimony that [the court] think[s] was tainted because of the testimony that came in from the witness, Rowena Standing Alone.</blockquote>\n<p id=\"b1369-12\">The judge denied a defense motion for dismissal and set a new trial date of May 15.</p>\n<p id=\"b1369-13\">After a second jury was empaneled Sanders filed a motion to dismiss on double jeopardy grounds. The motion was denied. The judge then granted the government\u2019s motion to prevent Standing Alone from being called as a witness, on the ground that requiring her to testify would violate her privilege against self-incrimination. He denied Sanders\u2019 motion to declare Standing Alone to be an unavailable witness so that her prior recorded testimony could be read into the record pursuant to Fed.R.Evid. 804. He also denied Sanders\u2019 motion to prevent witness Wolfblack from testifying about threats allegedly made to Wolfblack by Sanders.</p>\n<p id=\"b1369-14\">At the second trial Sanders\u2019 defense consisted of attacking the credibility of the prosecution witnesses by demonstrating the relationships among them and by suggesting reasons why they might want to incriminate Sanders. The district court prohibited any cross-examination referring to Standing Alone or her involvement. The jury returned a guilty verdict.</p>\n<p id=\"b1369-15\">DOUBLE JEOPARDY</p>\n<p id=\"b1369-16\">Sanders contends that the district court abused its discretion in declaring a mistrial over his objection. He argues that there was no need for the mistrial because an integral portion of his defense was to cast doubt on the credibility of Standing Alone and the other witnesses related to her.</p>\n<p id=\"b1370-3\"><page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"1296\">*1296</page-number>In a jury trial, \u201cjeopardy attaches when the jury is empaneled and sworn.\u201d <em>Crist v. Bretz, </em>437 U.S. 28, 29, 98 S.Ct. 2156, 2157, 57 L.Ed.2d 24 (1978).<footnotemark>2</footnotemark> The defendant, at that point, has a \u201cvalued right to have his trial completed by a particular tribunal.\u201d Wade v. <em>Hunter, </em>336 U.S. 684, 689, 69 S.Ct. 834, 837, 93 L.Ed.2d 974 (1949), <em>quoted in Arizona v. Washington, </em>434 U.S. 497, 503, 98 S.Ct. 824, 54 L.Ed.2d 717 (1978); <em>Illinois v. Somerville, </em>410 U.S. 458, 466, 93 S.Ct. 1066, 35 L.Ed.2d 425 (1973); and <em>United States v. Jorn, </em>400 U.S. 470, 484, 91 S.Ct. 547, 27 L.Ed.2d 543 (1971).<footnotemark>3</footnotemark></p>\n<p id=\"b1370-4\">A defendant clearly may not be reprosecuted for the same crime after an acquittal. <em>Benton v. Maryland, </em>395 U.S. 784, 796, 89 S.Ct. 2056, 23 L.Ed.2d 707 (1969). In some instances, however, a court may have to discharge a jury before it makes a decision on guilt or innocence. Discharge in such cases will not necessarily operate to the defendant\u2019s disadvantage, and may even be at the defendant\u2019s behest.<footnotemark>4</footnotemark></p>\n<p id=\"b1370-5\">When the jury is discharged before a determination on the merits, a court must balance the defendant\u2019s right to have the trial completed by a specific tribunal against \u201cthe public interest in affording the prosecutor one full and fair opportunity to present his evidence to an impartial jury.\u201d <em>Arizona v. Washington, </em>434 U.S. at 505, 98 S.Ct. at 830, <em>citing United States v. Jorn, </em>400 U.S. at 479-80, 91 S.Ct. 547. However, because the defendant\u2019s right is of constitutional origin, the prosecutor has a heavy burden to meet in seeking reprosecution after a mistrial over the defendant\u2019s objection. The prosecutor must demonstrate that the mistrial resulted from \u201cmanifest necessity.\u201d <em>Id.</em><footnotemark><em>5</em></footnotemark></p>\n<p id=\"b1370-13\">The words \u201c \u2018manifest necessity\u2019 . do not describe a standard that can be applied mechanically or without attention to the particular problem confronting the trial judge.\u201d 434 U.S. at 505-06, 98 S.Ct. at 830-1. The Court has recognized that there are \u201cdegrees of necessity,\u201d 434 U.S. at 506, 98 S.Ct. 824, and that the deference to be given the trial judge\u2019s decision to declare a mistrial must vary according to the circumstances which require the mistrial.</p>\n<p id=\"b1370-15\">The judge\u2019s decision should be strictly scrutinized \u201cwhen there is reason to believe that the prosecutor is using the superi- or resources of the State to harass or to achieve a tactical advantage over the accused.\u201d 434 U.S. at 508, 98 S.Ct. at 832, <em>citing Bowman v. United States, </em>372 U.S. 734, 736 (1963). At the other extreme, great deference should be accorded a trial judge's decision to discharge a jury which appears to be deadlocked. 434 U.S. at 510.</p>\n<p id=\"b1371-4\"><page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"1297\">*1297</page-number>A trial judge\u2019s decision to declare a mistrial because of possible juror bias is also deserving of great deference.</p>\n<blockquote id=\"b1371-5\">[The judge] has seen and heard the jurors during their <em>voir dire </em>examination. He is the judge most familiar with the evidence and the background of the case on trial. He has listened to the tone of the argument as it was delivered and has observed the apparent reaction of the jurors. In short, he is far more \u201cconversant with the factors relevant to the determination\u201d than any reviewing court can possibly be.</blockquote>\n<p id=\"b1371-6\">434 U.S. at 513-14, 98 S.Ct. at 834, <em>quoting Wade v. Hunter, </em>336 U.S. 684, 689, 69 S.Ct. 834, 93 L.Ed. 974 (1949). Nevertheless, because the mistrial decision affects a constitutionally protected right, \u201creviewing courts have an obligation to satisfy themselves that, . . ., the trial judge exercised \u2018sound discretion\u2019 in declaring a mistrial.\u201d 434 U.S. at 514, 98 S.Ct. at 835, <em>quoting United States v. Perez, </em>22 U.S. (9 Wheat.) 579, 580, 6 L.Ed. 165 (1824).</p>\n<p id=\"b1371-8\">In <em>State of Arizona v. Washington, </em>546 F.2d 829 (9th Cir. 1976), <em>rev\u2019d sub nom. Arizona v. Washington, </em>434 U.S. 497, 98 S.Ct. 824, 54 L.Ed.2d 717 (1978), this court decided that a state court judge had improperly declared a mistrial after defense counsel, at voir dire and in his opening remarks to the jury, referred to the prosecutor\u2019s withholding of evidence in a previous trial.<footnotemark>6</footnotemark> Because the judge did not specify his reasons for granting the government\u2019s motion for mistrial, this court concluded that the motion should not have been granted and reprosecution of the defendant was barred by the double jeopardy clause.</p>\n<p id=\"b1371-12\">The Supreme Court reversed this decision in <em>Arizona v. Washington, </em>holding that the trial judge\u2019s ruling was not necessarily erroneous merely because he failed explicitly to set forth the \u201cmanifest necessity\u201d which justified the mistrial.<footnotemark>7</footnotemark> The Court then examined the record in detail, to determine whether it reflected the requisite degree of necessity.</p>\n<p id=\"b1371-13\">The Court pointed out that the trial judge had taken great pains to weigh carefully the respective interests of the parties. After defense counsel\u2019s first mention of the earlier trial at voir dire, the judge polled the jury to determine whether they were aware of the reason for the new trial. At that point, they were not. At opening argument, however, defense counsel told the jury that the new trial was necessary \u201cbecause the prosecutor deliberately withheld exculpatory evidence from the defense.\u201d 434 U.S. at 515 n.34, 98 S.Ct. at 835 n.34. The prosecutor then moved for a mistrial.</p>\n<p id=\"b1371-14\">The trial judge heard argument on the motion. When defense counsel insisted that there was legal support for admitting evidence of the earlier trial, the judge postponed ruling on the motion to allow counsel to provide the necessary support. The following day, the judge \u201cheard extensive argument from both sides regarding both the propriety of defense counsel\u2019s opening statement and the need for a mistrial.\u201d <em>Id. </em>He expressly considered the alternative of issuing a cautionary instruction and concluded that it would be \u201cinadequate to remove the risk of taint.\u201d <em>Id. </em>Only then did he grant the prosecutor\u2019s motion for mistrial.</p>\n<p id=\"b1371-15\">Based on its review of the record, the Court concluded that \u201cthe trial judge acted <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"1298\">*1298</page-number>responsibly and deliberately,\u201d exercising \u201c \u2018sound discretion\u2019 in handling the sensitive problem of possible juror bias.\u201d 434 U.S. at 516, 98 S.Ct. at 835. The mistrial ruling was based upon the requisite \u201cmanifest necessity.\u201d</p>\n<p id=\"b1372-4\">In this case, although the judge gave his reasons for the mistrial, the record does not reveal a similar concern on his part for the double jeopardy consequences of an erroneous ruling. The prosecutor had not requested a mistrial when the judge, sua <em>sponte, </em>informed the jury of Standing Alone\u2019s perjury. He discharged the jury over the defendant\u2019s objection.</p>\n<p id=\"b1372-5\">Although he carefully considered the motion for continuance, listening to argument out of the presence of the jury and personally reviewing the handwriting exemplars, he allowed no opportunity for argument from either side on the need for a mistrial. He listened to Sanders\u2019 objections only <em>after </em>the jury had been excused, but at that point, argument was patently too late.</p>\n<p id=\"b1372-6\">The judge\u2019s reason for declaring the mistrial was to avoid \u201cprejudice as far as the defendant is concerned\u201d from the \u201ctainted\u201d testimony of Standing Alone.<footnotemark>8</footnotemark> Yet, given that Sanders intended to attack the credibility of Standing Alone and other witnesses, it is more likely that he would have benefited rather than suffered from the \u201ctainted\u201d testimony. In any event, nothing in the record indicates that the judge considered alternatives to a mistrial which could have dispelled any perceived bias on the part of the jurors, such as allowing cross-examination of Standing Alone<footnotemark>9</footnotemark> or issuing a curative instruction.</p>\n<p id=\"b1372-12\">Unlike the record in <em>Arizona v. Washington, </em>the record here does not reveal the manifest necessity for a mistrial. Nor does it disclose the responsible and deliberate consideration on the part of the trial judge which constitutes the exercise of \u201csound discretion.\u201d We hold that Sanders\u2019 second prosecution violated the double jeopardy clause because the first one improperly ended in a mistrial. His conviction must be reversed.</p>\n<p id=\"b1372-13\">Our decision is in accord with those from other circuits decided after the Supreme Court ruled in <em>Arizona </em>v. <em>Washington. </em>In <em>United States v. Horn, </em>583 F.2d 1124 (10th Cir. 1978), the Tenth Circuit reversed a district judge\u2019s <em>sua sponte </em>declaration of a mistrial. The jury in <em>Horn </em>had had difficulty in its deliberations, and at one point sent a note that it was deadlocked. The judge gave an <em>Allen </em>charge, then allowed the jurors an overnight recess. \u25a0 On the following morning, after the jury had deliberated for an hour, the judge declared a mistrial.</p>\n<p id=\"b1372-14\">The Tenth Circuit concluded that, even if the judge believed, in good faith, that the jury was deadlocked, there was no evidence of deadlock at the time he declared the mistrial. The judge neglected to inquire whether there had been progress in the deliberations and the earlier note from the jury did not necessarily indicate its position after hearing the <em>Allen </em>charge and resuming deliberations.</p>\n<p id=\"b1372-15\">In <em>Hogan v. Dunkerley, </em>579 F.2d 141 (2d Cir. 1978), <em>cert. </em>denied, - U.S. --, 99 <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"1299\">*1299</page-number>S.Ct. 872, 59 L.Ed.2d 56 (1979), a state court judge declared a mistrial on his own motion after learning that the defendant would have to be hospitalized for a collapsed lung for seven to ten days. Defense counsel strenuously objected to the mistrial, expressly raised the double jeopardy consequences of the ruling, and requested a continuance as an alternative. The Second Circuit held that, because the trial judge did not explain why a continuance was not feasible, there was no manifest necessity for the mistrial and reprosecution of the defendant unconstitutionally placed him twice in jeopardy.<footnotemark>10</footnotemark></p>\n<p id=\"b1373-5\">The Fifth Circuit reversed a district judge who declared a mistrial upon learning that the defendant exchanged remarks with a juror. <em>United States v. Starling, </em>571 F.2d 934 (5th Cir. 1978). Although the judge determined that all jurors were aware of the communication, he apparently misunderstood the foreman\u2019s attempt to explain that the jurors were unaffected by what had transpired. The order granting the mistrial indicated the judge\u2019s belief that the communication prejudiced the jurors against the defendant. His conclusion was not supported by his on-the-record conversation with the foreman. Therefore there was no manifest necessity for the mistrial.</p>\n<p id=\"b1373-6\">In <em>United States v. Rich, </em>589 F.2d 1025 (10th Cir. 1978), the district judge <em>sua sponte </em>discharged the jury in a criminal case over a defense objection. The judge gave no reason for the discharge and none was apparent on the record. The Tenth Circuit concluded that the judge had abused his discretion, and reprosecution of the defendant was barred by the double jeopardy clause.</p>\n<p id=\"b1373-8\"><em>United States v. Klein, </em>582 F.2d 186 (2d Cir. 1978), <em>cert. denied sub nom. Klein v. United </em>States, - U.S. -, 99 S.Ct. 843, 59 L.Ed.2d 38 (1979), stands in contrast to the above cases. The trial judge there evidenced scrupulous care to avoid a premature declaration of mistrial due to jury deadlock. He carefully responded to all jury requests for information. He consulted with counsel for both sides before communicating with the jury. He requested counsel\u2019s suggestions regarding the wording of an <em>Allen </em>charge. He expressly considered the alternatives to mistrial. Thus, even though he did not set forth the basis for his mistrial ruling, the record amply demonstrated that he exercised sound discretion and that there was a \u201cmanifest necessity\u201d for the mistrial.</p>\n<p id=\"b1373-11\">These cases teach that, even when the judge explains his or her reasons for declaring a mistrial, the record must support the explicit or implicit finding of \u201cmanifest necessity.\u201d This is especially true when the judge makes a <em>sua sponte </em>ruling over the defendant\u2019s objection. When the record is barren of reasons for the mistrial <em>(Rich), </em>or discloses that the judge\u2019s assumptions regarding jury deadlock <em>(Horn) </em>or juror bias <em>(Starling) </em>were unfounded, or reveals that the judge failed adequately to consider feasible alternatives to a mistrial <em>(Dunkerley),</em><footnotemark><em>11</em></footnotemark><em> </em>then the decision to declare a mistrial may be reversed by a reviewing court, despite the high degree of deference to be accorded the conclusions of the trial judge in such cases.</p>\n<p id=\"b1373-12\">The conviction is reversed.</p>\n<footnote label=\"1\">\n<p id=\"b1369-10\">. Standing Alone\u2019s testimony was vivid. She stated that Sanders \u201ctook a blue, skinny pen and signed the check, Danny Hope.\u201d Reporter\u2019s Transcript at 33. When asked if she had doubts about her testimony, she said, \u201cNo doubt in my mind. I seen him with my own two eyes.\u201d <em>Id. </em>at 35.</p>\n</footnote>\n<footnote label=\"2\">\n<p id=\"b1370-6\">. In <em>Crist, </em>the Court made it clear that this is a constitutional rule. Therefore, a state may not arbitrarily declare that jeopardy attaches at some later point. The Court struck down a Montana statute which provided that jeopardy does not attach until the first witness is sworn.</p>\n</footnote>\n<footnote label=\"3\">\n<p id=\"b1370-7\">. In <em>Arizona v. Washington, </em>the Court enumerated the reasons why the defendant\u2019s \u201cvalued right\u201d warrants constitutional protection. A second prosecution</p>\n<blockquote id=\"b1370-8\">increases the financial and emotional burden on the accused, prolongs the period in which he is stigmatized by an unresolved accusation of wrongdoing, and may even enhance the risk that an innocent defendant may be convicted.</blockquote>\n<p id=\"b1370-9\">434 U.S. at 503-04, 98 S.Ct. at 829 (footnotes omitted).</p>\n</footnote>\n<footnote label=\"4\">\n<p id=\"b1370-10\">. A defendant who moves for a mistrial is usually held to have waived the double jeopardy bar to reprosecution. <em>United States v. Jorn, </em>400 U.S. 470, 485, 91 S.Ct. 547, 27 L.Ed.2d 543 (1971), <em>quoted in United States v. Scott, </em>437 U.S. 82, 93, 98 S.Ct. 2187, 2195, 57 L.Ed.2d 65 (1978). <em>See also United States v. Bobo, </em>586 F.2d 355, 362 (5th Cir. 1978). <em>Cf. Sedgwick v.

Nelson, </em>582 F.2d 1246, 1249 (10th Cir. 1978). <em>See also United States v. Rumpf, </em>576 F.2d 818, 822 (10th Cir. 1978).</p>\n</footnote>\n<footnote label=\"5\">\n<p id=\"b1370-20\">.

The Court believed that the absence of express findings by the trial court was critical to this court\u2019s decision. 434 U.S. at 502 n.9, 98 S.Ct. 824. However, in light of <em>Arizona v. Washington, </em>it also reversed a Second Circuit opinion which held that a mistrial was inappropriate where the defendant had not consented and the trial court had failed to consider alternatives to the mistrial ruling. <em>United States v. Grasso, </em>552 F.2d 46 (2d Cir. 1977), <em>vacated and remanded, </em>438 U.S. 901, 98 S.Ct. 3117, 57 L.Ed.2d 1144 (1978).</p>\n</footnote>\n<footnote label=\"8\">\n<p id=\"b1372-7\">. In discharging the jury, the judge explained: [I]n the eight years that I have been serving as a District Court Judge, this is the first time a Perry Mason element has entered into a case. . . . [I]n all fairness to the defendant, because of the very strong testimony that the witness gave saying that she saw him sign the check with a thin blue pen, those things are hard to put out of your mind once you have heard them, and I think in all fairness to everybody, I would just not feel right as a Judge letting this case go any farther at this time.</p>\n</footnote>\n<footnote label=\"9\">\n<p id=\"b1372-10\">. Because Standing Alone was not a defendant, she could have been called as a witness, even if she intended to assert her Fifth Amendment privilege against self-incrimination. <em>United States </em>v. Gay, 567 F.2d 916, 918 (9th Cir.), <em>cert. denied, </em>435 U.S. 999, 98 S.Ct. 1655, 56 L.Ed.2d 90 (1978); <em>United States v. Bautista, </em>509 F.2d 675 (9th Cir.), <em>cert. denied sub nom.

In <em>Mizell, </em>the state court judge denied a two day continuance to allow prosecution witnesses to testify because to do so would inconvenience the jury.
