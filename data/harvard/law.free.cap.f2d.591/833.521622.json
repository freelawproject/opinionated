Powe, was convicted by a jury of distributing one tablet of phenmetrazine in violation of 21 U.S.C. \u00a7 841(a). She contends that reversal is required because the trial judge permitted the government to impeach her credibility by introducing evidence of admissions of guilt she made in response to offers of leniency. Although appellant did not raise this issue at trial, it is firmly established that self-incriminating statements induced by promises or offers of leniency shall be regarded as involuntary and shall not be admitted into evidence for any purpose.<footnotemark>1</footnotemark> Therefore, in the circumstances of this case we remand the record to the district court for further proceedings to determine whether appellant\u2019s alleged admissions were obtained in a manner consistent with Fifth Amendment principles.</p>\n<p id=\"b910-22\">I</p>\n<p id=\"b910-23\">On May 18, 1976, Officer Gregory Green of the Metropolitan Police Department was operating as an undercover agent in Northwest Washington, D. C. At approximately 2:15 in the afternoon, on a corner at 4th and M Streets, Green was approached by Arthur Harris, a man he believed to be a \u201cknown narcotics dealer.\u201d Transcript (Tr.) 14-15. Harris offered to sell Green some <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"837\">*837</page-number>phenmetrazine, and when Green accepted the offer, Harris turned to a woman standing next to him and told her to hand Green a pill. <em>Id.</em></p>\n<p id=\"b911-5\">Although Officer Green did not recognize the woman with Harris at the time of the alleged transaction, he allegedly saw her later when Harris was booked for his role in the offense<footnotemark>2</footnotemark> and again in the courtroom at Harris\u2019 preliminary hearing.<footnotemark>3</footnotemark> After seeing appellant in the courtroom, Green arrested her with the assistance of Detective Rosewal Yates. At that time, the appellant was advised of her <em>Miranda </em>rights.<footnotemark>4</footnotemark></p>\n<p id=\"b911-6\">At trial, appellant testified in her own behalf. Although she acknowledged that Harris was her boyfriend and that she had seen him engage in narcotics transactions, appellant denied her own involvement in any transactions and specifically denied involvement in the offense charged. Tr. 58-59. On direct examination, defense counsel asked appellant whether, at the time of her arrest, she had made any statements to the police. Tr. 56. When she replied that she had, counsel asked to approach the bench. Tr. 57. The ensuing conference developed as follows:</p>\n<blockquote id=\"b911-7\">THE COURT: Are you surprised?</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b911-8\">[Counsel]: Very surprised.</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b911-9\">THE COURT: Do you want to withdraw the question?</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b911-10\">[Counsel]: I will withdraw the question.</blockquote>\n<p id=\"b911-11\"><em>Id. </em>The trial judge knew that counsel was taken aback by appellant\u2019s response because, only moments earlier, counsel had informed the judge at the bench that her \u201ctestimony will be she made no statement at all.\u201d Tr. 56.</p>\n<p id=\"b911-12\">Although defense counsel asked no further questions of appellant concerning her statements to the police, the prosecutor returned to the subject on cross-examination. First, he asked whether she had told Detective Yates that she felt sorry for Harris because she had gotten him involved with narcotics in the first place. Tr. 63. She replied, \u201cI don\u2019t remember making a statement like that.\u201d <em>Id. </em>Second, the prosecutor asked whether she had told Yates that her role in narcotics transactions was to hold the drugs for Harris while he negotiated with customers. She answered, \u201cNo.\u201d <em>Id.</em></p>\n<p id=\"b911-17\">Defense counsel attempted on redirect examination to determine just what statements appellant did make to the police:</p>\n<blockquote id=\"AHy\">Q. Miss Powe, what did you say to the police when you talked to Detective Yates?</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b911-18\">A. Well, they was asking me about, you know, what I had to do with narcotics and at the time I told them I was a drug user and Mr. Yates made propositions to me as far as turning over drug dealers up in that area over to him, to drop my case and Mr. Harris\u2019s case.</blockquote>\n<p id=\"b911-19\">Tr. 64. Evidently, appellant used the plural pronoun \u201cthey\u201d because Yates was accompanied during the interrogation by Officer Green. Tr. 79-80. It is not clear whether Green questioned appellant, or was simply present. In any event, defense counsel did not pursue the matter further during redirect.</p>\n<p id=\"b911-20\">In order to impeach appellant\u2019s testimony, the government then reopened its case and called Detective Yates, who had not testified initially. He indicated that at first appellant refused to talk at all, but began to do so after it was suggested that her cooperation might prove beneficial:</p>\n<blockquote id=\"b912-3\"><page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"838\">*838</page-number>Q. [by the prosecutor] Now, did Miss Powe at any time [after receiving <em>Miranda </em>warnings] indicate to you that she didn\u2019t want to talk to you?</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b912-4\">A. At that time, no, she did not want to talk.</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b912-5\">Q. Now, did there come a time subsequent to that that you did talk to her?</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b912-6\">A. Yes.</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b912-7\">Q. Could you describe the circumstances of that conversation, sir?</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b912-8\">A. During the conversation, asking her if she wanted to cooperate with the police on drug traffic at 4th and M Streets and during that conversation, I stated to her: You really don\u2019t want the other defendant Harris to fall for Harris [sic], get in trouble because of his activities and her statements were that: I am the one feeling sorry for him because I introduced him into drug trafficking.</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b912-9\">Q. And at the time you were engaging in this conversation, did she indicate a willingness to talk to you, sir?</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b912-10\">A. Yes, she did.</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b912-11\">Q. Did your conversation include anything else, sir?</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b912-12\">A. Well, she stated that she held the drugs while Harris did the selling.</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b912-13\">Q. And what was the context that that particular statement was given to you in?</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b912-14\">A. It was broken off back and forth during a conversation.</blockquote>\n<p id=\"b912-15\">Tr. 71-72.</p>\n<p id=\"b912-16\">At the conclusion of Yates\u2019 direct testimony, the trial judge responded <em>sua sponte </em>by instructing the jury that the government\u2019s evidence of appellant\u2019s admissions could be considered for purposes of impeachment only. Tr. 75-76. He indicated that the basis for this instruction was \u201cthe Harris case,\u201d Tr. 75, evidently referring to <em>Harris v. New York, </em>401 U.S. 222, 91 S.Ct. 643, 28 L.Ed.2d 1 (1971).</p>\n<p id=\"b912-17\">Finally, defense counsel sought to clarify the circumstances of the interrogation in his cross-examination of Detective Yates:</p>\n<blockquote id=\"b912-19\">Q. Detective, you testified that originally Miss Powe stated that she did not want to talk to you?</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b912-20\">A. That is correct.</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b912-21\">Q. What did she say to you?</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b912-22\">A. That was after giving her the rights. I asked her where she lived and stuff like that and mentioned where she wanted to go and what she wanted to do. At the beginning of the processing, she was quite hostile and she didn\u2019t want to speak to us about anything.</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b912-23\">Q. How much time elapsed before she finally talked or spoke to you?</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b912-24\">A. I would say about a half hour, hour or so, roughly a half an hour.</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b912-25\">Q. Did you, during that half hour, did you leave her by herself?</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b912-26\">A. No, this is during the processing.</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b912-27\">Q. After that half hour, did you ask her again if she wanted to speak to you?</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b912-28\">A. Yes, not just asked if she would, wanted to speak. I started talking to her about certain questions and everything else and during this time asked her if she wanted to cooperate and to assist herself in this case and help herself out.</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b912-29\">Q. What did you mean by that?</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b912-30\">A. Well, to cooperate with the police and help her to get other drug traffickers in the city, assist herself to work off the case if need be.</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b912-31\">Q. Was it at this time that she made these statements to you?</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b912-32\">A. Shortly after, yes. She started talking. I started talking and she started giving information, certain information of elements about the city and things like that.</blockquote>\n<p id=\"b912-33\">Tr. 76-77.</p>\n<p id=\"b912-34\">II</p>\n<p id=\"b912-35\">It is by now too well-established to require extensive discussion that a conviction based, in whole or in part, upon an involuntary confession deprives the defendant of due process.<footnotemark>5</footnotemark> In order to protect this <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"839\">*839</page-number>\u201cjealously guarded constitutional principle,\u201d<footnotemark>6</footnotemark> the Supreme Court in <em>Jackson v. Denno, </em>378 U.S. 368, 84 S.Ct. 1774, 12 L.Ed.2d 908 (1964), established a procedure to ensure that the defendant would have \u201ca fair hearing and a reliable determination on the issue of voluntariness.\u201d<footnotemark>7</footnotemark> Not only must the trial judge determine that a confession was freely and voluntarily given before allowing a jury to hear it, but the trial judge\u2019s \u201cconclusion that the confession is voluntary must appear from the record with unmistakable clarity.\u201d <em>Sims v. Georgia, </em>385 U.S. 538, 544, 87 S.Ct. 639, 643, 17 L.Ed.2d 593 (1967).</p>\n<p id=\"b913-4\">Ordinarily, the issue of voluntariness will be raised by the defense, either by pretrial motion to suppress<footnotemark>8</footnotemark> or by objection at trial.<footnotemark>9</footnotemark> When an objection is lodged, the hearing requirements mandated by <em>Jackson v. Denno </em>are triggered, and a hearing must be held out of the presence of the jury to determine whether the confession is admissible. The question presented by this unusual case is whether, and under what circumstances, the trial judge has a responsibility <em>sua sponte </em>to raise the issue of voluntariness and to hold the hearing prescribed by <em>Jackson v. Denno.</em></p>\n<p id=\"b913-12\">A</p>\n<p id=\"b913-13\">We start our analysis with the fundamental proposition that conviction of a defendant based upon a confession that is conceded to be involuntary would offend due process, whether or not the defendant strictly adhered to all of the procedural requirements of the trial court.<footnotemark>10</footnotemark> The Supreme Court has enumerated several of the \u201ccomplex of values\u201d underlying the stricture against the use of involuntary confessions.<footnotemark>11</footnotemark> Of primary concern is the interest <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"840\">*840</page-number>in ensuring the trustworthiness of evidence. As the Court has recognized, coerced statements are inherently suspect, and the methods of coercion are not limited to acts of physical brutality.<footnotemark>12</footnotemark> As long ago as 1897, the Supreme Court announced that a confession shall be deemed involuntary if it was \u201cextracted by any sort of threats or violence [o]r obtained by any direct or implied promises, however slight, [o]r by the exertion of any improper influence.\u201d<footnotemark>13</footnotemark></p>\n<p id=\"b914-4\">However, the Court has also made it clear that the reliability of evidence is not the only concern. Due process forbids the use of an involuntary confession without regard for its truth or falsity,<footnotemark>14</footnotemark> and even if there is ample evidence aside from the confession to support a verdict:<footnotemark>15</footnotemark></p>\n<blockquote id=\"b914-5\">As important as it is that persons who have committed crimes be convicted, there are considerations which transcend the question of guilt or innocence. Thus, in cases involving involuntary confessions, this Court enforces the strongly felt attitude of our society that important human values are sacrificed where an agency of the government, in the course of securing a conviction, wrings a confession out of an accused against his will.</blockquote>\n<p id=\"AJE\"><em>Blackburn v. Alabama, </em>361 U.S. 199, 206-207, 80 S.Ct. 274, 280, 4 L.Ed.2d 242 (1960).</p>\n<p id=\"b914-10\">One of the considerations consistently cited in decisions of the Supreme Court is the interest in preserving the individual\u2019s \u201cfreedom of will.\u201d<footnotemark>16</footnotemark> Although various formulations have been given to this concept,<footnotemark>17</footnotemark> this court has explained that the phrase embraces the principle that \u201c[t]he make-up of a free man includes his mechanisms for self-preservation, to refrain from speech that may endanger him. . . . But his statement does not reflect his own free will or intellect if his statement is attributable in critical measure to the fact that his self-<page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"841\">*841</page-number>protective mechanism is negated or overridden by external force or fraud, a condition of insanity, the compulsion of drugs.\u201d<footnotemark>18</footnotemark></p>\n<p id=\"b915-5\">Yet another interest served by the exclusion of involuntary confessions is the deterrence of questionable police conduct.<footnotemark>19</footnotemark> \u201cThe abhorrence of society to the use of involuntary confessions . . . also turns on the deep-rooted feeling that the police must obey the law while enforcing the law; that in the end life and liberty can be as much endangered from illegal methods used to convict those thought to be criminals as from the actual criminals themselves.\u201d<footnotemark>20</footnotemark> Finally, the proscription against the use of involuntary confessions reflects the basic societal conviction that the very integrity of the criminal justice system is compromised when it operates to take advantage of a person whose volitional capacity is seriously impaired.<footnotemark>21</footnotemark></p>\n<p id=\"b915-8\">Indeed, the right not to offer testimony against oneself except by \u201cfree and rational choice\u201d is so firmly rooted in our notion of fundamental fairness that the Constitution does not countenance the use of an involuntary confession or admission by the accused for any purpose in a criminal trial. \u201c[A]ny criminal trial use against a defendant of his <em>involuntary </em>statement is a denial of due process of law, \u2018even though there is ample evidence aside from the confession to support the conviction.\u2019 \u201d <em>Mincey v. Arizona, </em>437 U.S. 385, 398, 98 S.Ct. 2408, 2416, 57 L.Ed.2d 290 (1978).<footnotemark>22</footnotemark></p>\n<p id=\"b915-16\">It is true that the accused\u2019s right not to have an involuntary confession offered against him at trial may be waived. But the Supreme Court has always set high standards of proof for the waiver of constitutional rights. The requirement of \u201can intentional relinquishment or abandonment of a known right or privilege\u201d was first articulated in a case involving the validity of a defendant\u2019s decision to waive the right to counsel. <em>Johnson v. Zerbst, </em>304 U.S. 458, <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"842\">*842</page-number>464, 58 S.Ct. 1019, 1023, 82 L.Ed. 1461 (1938). Since then, the requirement of a knowing and intelligent waiver has been applied to other rights constitutionally guaranteed to a criminal defendant to protect a fair trial and the reliability of the truth-determining process.<footnotemark>23</footnotemark> Of particular relevance to this case, the <em>Johnson </em>criteria have been applied to test the effectiveness of a guilty plea<footnotemark>24</footnotemark> \u2014 which itself incorporates waivers of the privilege against compulsory self-incrimination <footnotemark>25</footnotemark> and the right to contest the admissibility of any evidence the State might have offered against the defendant<footnotemark>26</footnotemark> and waiver of the privilege against self-incrimination during custodial interrogation.<footnotemark>27</footnotemark> These safeguards demonstrate, in analogous contexts, the caution with which inculpatory pronouncements must be received and the scrutiny which the trial court must exercise before permitting a defendant in a criminal case to relinquish the basic rights indispensable to a fair trial.</p>\n<p id=\"b916-4\">B.</p>\n<p id=\"b916-5\">Of course, our adversary system places primary reliance on the defendant and defense counsel to raise the issue of the voluntariness of a confession. Ordinarily, it is the defendant who is most familiar with the circumstances surrounding any statements she may have given, and it is the defense counsel who, through investigation and familiarity with the relevant legal doctrines, is best prepared to realize whether the question of voluntariness is raised by the events that transpired.<footnotemark>28</footnotemark> Moreover, it is conceivable that defense counsel may for tactical reasons waive a valid objection to introduction of the defendant\u2019s statements.<footnotemark>29</footnotemark> The trial judge typically does not play an inquisitorial role in our legal system, and is limited to consideration of the testimony presented in open court in discovering how a confession was obtained. Thus, unless the voluntariness question is brought to the attention of the trial court, the trial judge generally is not required to raise the issue <em>su a sponte, </em>and a <em>Jackson v. Denno </em>hearing is not constitutionally mandated.<footnotemark>30</footnotemark></p>\n<p id=\"b916-14\">It has been recognized, however, that certain \u201calerting circumstances\u201d may impose a duty on the trial judge to take a <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"843\">*843</page-number>more active role in the trial process and to investigate the need for a hearing on the voluntariness of a confession.<footnotemark>31</footnotemark> As this court has previously emphasized, \u201c[t]he judge ... is not a passive by-stander in the arena of justice, a spectator at a \u2018sporting event;\u2019 \u201d<footnotemark>32</footnotemark> rather, when it appears clearly during the course of a trial that there is doubt as to the voluntariness of a confession, the trial judge may be required to conduct an inquiry on that issue despite failure of defense counsel to offer an objection.<footnotemark>33</footnotemark> This procedure safeguards the accused\u2019s due process right to be free of <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"844\">*844</page-number>a conviction based upon an involuntary confession and is consistent with the requirement in similar contexts of a knowing and intelligent waiver of fundamental rights. Indeed, at least one circuit has established a procedure that requires the trial judge to hold a hearing on the voluntariness issue <em>whenever </em>a confession is proffered by the Government, and even though there be no objection from defense counsel.<footnotemark>34</footnotemark> We need not go so far, however, for we hold only that in the circumstances of this case, a substantial question of voluntariness was raised and the trial judge should have conducted further inquiry on that issue.</p>\n<p id=\"b918-8\">Ill</p>\n<p id=\"b918-9\">Ironically, most of the evidence supporting appellant\u2019s contention that she was induced to incriminate herself against her will comes from the mouths of the government\u2019s own witnesses. Detective Yates, one of the officers who conducted the interrogation, testified that after being advised of her rights, appellant refused to talk to the police.<footnotemark>35</footnotemark> Approximately one-<page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"845\">*845</page-number>half hour to an hour later, while appellant, who had never previously been arrested, was still in custody and had yet to consult an attorney, Detective Yates asked Ms. Powe if she wanted to \u201ccooperate and assist herself in this case and help herself out.\u201d<footnotemark>36</footnotemark> It was only in response to these questions that appellant started talking to the officers and made the alleged admissions.<footnotemark>37</footnotemark> This undisputed account of the interrogation, offered by the government\u2019s own witness,<footnotemark>38</footnotemark> squarely raised the issue of voluntariness and should have alerted the trial judge to the possibility that appellant\u2019s alleged incriminations were induced by \u201cany direct or implied promises, however slight.\u201d<footnotemark>39</footnotemark></p>\n<p id=\"b919-10\">Moreover, the trial judge\u2019s vigilance should have been heightened by the odd turn-of-events that transpired and defense counsel\u2019s apparent unpreparedness and inability to deal effectively with the problems posed by appellant\u2019s alleged admissions.<footnotemark>40</footnotemark> First, counsel apparently was unaware that his client had even made any statements to the police. Immediately after defense counsel had assured the court that his client would say that \u201cshe made no statement at all,\u201d<footnotemark>41</footnotemark> appellant testified that she had in<page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"846\">*846</page-number>deed made a statement. Tr. 56-57. Despite expressing his \u201csurprise\u201d at this development, defense counsel did not confer with his client and barely paused before continuing to question the appellant. Furthermore, defense counsel failed to take even a brief recess in order to examine the legal principles governing the admissibility of appellant\u2019s incriminating statements and to consider what changes in trial preparation and strategy might be necessitated by the sudden developments. Consequently, although the testimony of Detective Yates raised serious questions about the means by which appellant\u2019s admissions were obtained, defense counsel lodged no objection to their introduction, and the trial judge sua <em>sponte </em>instructed the jury that the government\u2019s evidence of the alleged statements could be considered only on the issue of appellant\u2019s credibility.<footnotemark>42</footnotemark></p>\n<p id=\"b920-9\">IV</p>\n<p id=\"b920-10\">We cannot and do not mean to lay the entire responsibility for failure to inquire into the question of voluntariness at the feet of the trial judge<footnotemark>43</footnotemark> Defense counsel, by failing to adequately raise the issue in the first instance, certainly fell short in his responsibility to safeguard his client\u2019s interests.<footnotemark>44</footnotemark> Likewise, appellant herself cannot be held entirely blameless.<footnotemark>45</footnotemark> But even in an adversary system in which \u201cthe vast array of trial decisions . . . rests with the accused and his attorney,\u201d<footnotemark>46</footnotemark> the trial court can no more stand idly by while the fundamental rights of a criminal defendant are forfeited through the inaction of ill-pre<page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"847\">*847</page-number>pared counsel than a reviewing court can fail to notice plain errors or defects affecting these substantial rights.<footnotemark>47</footnotemark> When, as here, the trial court is plainly alerted to the potential danger that the defendant\u2019s statements were obtained in violation of the Constitution, the judge ought to bear the responsibility for conducting further inquiry on that issue. <em>Jackson v. Denno </em>itself holds that a fair hearing and a reliable determination on the issue of voluntariness are constitutionally mandated where the trial court has indicated its awareness that the voluntariness issue has been raised, but no specific objection has been lodged by defense counsel.<footnotemark>48</footnotemark> And it may be that a hearing and determination is also required <em>as a constitutional matter </em>in cases where, as here, the indicia of involuntariness in the record are sufficiently compelling to alert the trial court to the problem.<footnotemark>49</footnotemark> In any event, however, it is not necessary for us to decide this constitutional question, for we have often stressed that the trial judge bears a continuing and \u201cmost pressing affirmative responsibility to see that justice is done in every case.\u201d<footnotemark>50</footnotemark> And, in supervising the administration of justice in the federal courts, we, too, have an obligation to protect the rights of the accused and to preserve the orderly functioning of trial courts. It is now axiomatic that a defendant would be deprived of due process of law if his conviction were founded, in whole or in <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"848\">*848</page-number>part, upon an involuntary confession.<footnotemark>51</footnotemark> Thus, as an exercise of the federal courts\u2019 \u201cjudicial authority to use their remedial mechanisms to redress or obviate such constitutional injuries,\u201d<footnotemark>52</footnotemark> we remand to the district court for a hearing on the issue of the voluntariness of any of appellant\u2019s alleged statements.</p>\n<p id=\"b922-4\">By leaving this determination in the first instance to the trial court, we do not mean to avoid our responsibility to make an independent evaluation of the record.<footnotemark>53</footnotemark> The record in this case, however, is necessarily incomplete owing to the failure of the trial court to conduct inquiry outside the hearing of the jury on the issue of voluntariness. Although it would appear on this record that any statements appellant Powe made to Detective Yates were induced by offers of leniency, we are reluctant to reverse for a new trial until the government has an opportunity to prove the contrary. If, for example, the government were able to establish that Powe acknowledged her role in the drug transaction with Harris before Detective Yates suggested that her cooperation might prove beneficial, the claim of involuntariness might be overcome.

For similar reasons, the court felt that it could not approve of any procedure that would allow the accused to testify that his statements were involuntary \u201cout of the jury\u2019s hearing at 9:30\u201d and then claim that he made no statements \u201cat 11:00 a. m., when the jury is recalled.\u201d <em>Id. </em>126 U.S.App.D.C. at 355, 379 F.2d at 132.</p>\n<p id=\"b918-10\">However, as the dissent in <em>Woody </em>noted, the defendant need not always testify at the nonjury hearing on voluntariness. In fact, the present case presents the possibility that the defendant would not have to testify in order to make out a case of involuntariness, an occurrence which the majority in <em>Woody </em>found \u201calmost impossible to conceive of.\u201d <em>Id. </em>126 U.S.App.D.C. 354 n. 2, 379 F.2d at 131 n. 2. Moreover, any defendant could always testify at the hearing to the circumstances surrounding the making of an alleged statement while at the same time denying the specific content of any such statement. And in the present case, the defendant has acknowledged having a conversation with the police. On remand, she could be questioned about what statements she did make and the circumstances surrounding them. The trial judge, in any event, could find that any admissions she did make \u2014 or might have made \u2014 were induced by offers of leniency and thus improperly introduced into evidence. Finally, because the government always bears the burden of establishing that any statements it seeks to introduce were made voluntarily, the Supreme Court has held that a defendant is entitled as a matter of due process to claim that a confession was involuntary even while denying under oath that he made it. <em>Lee v. Mississippi, </em>332 U.S. 742, 745-46, 68 S.Ct. 300, 92 L.Ed. 330 (1948). <em>See also Boles v. Stevenson, </em>379 U.S. 43, 85 S.Ct. 174, 13 L.Ed. 109 (1964).</p>\n</footnote>\n<footnote label=\"31\">\n<p id=\"b917-6\">. \u201cCertain alerting circumstances, such as a defendant\u2019s apparent abnormal mental or physical condition, obvious ignorance, or lack of awareness \u2014 all of which may reveal a dereliction in defense counsel\u2019s failure to object to the introduction of a confession \u2014 may, under due process standards, require a trial judge to investigate the necessity of conducting a hearing notwithstanding the absence of an objection.\u201d <em>United States v. Taylor, </em>374 F.2d 753, 756 (7th Cir. 1967).</p>\n<p id=\"b917-7\">In several cases, courts have held that evidence of involuntariness adduced at trial should have \u201calerted\u201d the trial judge to the need for such an inquiry in the absence of defense objection. In <em>LaFrance v. Bohlinger, </em>499 F.2d 29 (1st Cir.), <em>cert. denied, </em>419 U.S. 1080, 95 S.Ct. 669, 42 L.Ed.2d 674 (1974), for example, a habeas case, evidence of \u201cpolice threats and other blatant forms of physical and mental duress\u201d was found sufficiently \u201cglaring\u201d to have imposed a duty to inquire on the state trial judge. 499 F.2d at 35-36. And in <em>United States ex rel. Gainer </em>v. <em>New Jersey, </em>278 F.Supp. 127 (D.N.J.1967), the court found that when the defendant testified in his own behalf that an incriminating statement allegedly made by him was not his voluntary statement, the trial judge should have conducted an inquiry into the voluntariness of the confession, even though defense counsel stated affirmatively that there was no objection to its introduction into evidence. <em>See also Grieco v. United States, </em>435 F.2d 677, 678 (7th Cir. 1970) (no \u201cindicia of involuntariness available to flag the issue\u201d) (dictum), <em>cert. denied, </em>401 U.S. 1009, 91 S.Ct. 1251, 28 L.Ed.2d 544 (1971); <em>Jacobsen </em>v. <em>California, </em>431 F.2d 1017, 1019 (9th Cir. 1970) (hearing required \u201cwhere there is present in the record evidence tending to show such involuntariness\u201d) (dictum).</p>\n<p id=\"b917-8\">In other situations, evidence of the defendant\u2019s mental or emotional condition raised the risk that the confession was involuntary and required a hearing to be held despite the failure to object to its admissibility. Such a risk was found too great to ignore in <em>Hizel v. Sigler, </em>430 F.2d 1398, 1401 (8th Cir. 1970), a habeas case, where \u201cthe evidence adduced at trial indicated that the petitioner (1) suffers from chronic brain damage brought on by alcoholism, (2) is unable to read and can write only his last name, (3) has a mental age of eight to twelve years, (4) has a hearing impairment, (5) was under the influence of alcohol when interrogated, and (6) was not warned of his right to counsel or of his right to remain silent before being interrogated.\u201d (Note that <em>Miranda </em>was inapplicable because the trial occurred before <em>Miranda </em>was decided. <em>See Johnson v.

To begin with, the government offers an exceedingly narrow concept of \u201cincrimination.\u201d The Fifth Amendment privilege operates where the information sought to be extracted presents \u201ca realistic threat of incrimination,\u201d <em>Fisher v. United States, </em>425 U.S. 391, 412, 96 S.Ct. 1569, 48 L.Ed. 39 (1976), as distinguished from \u201ca mere imaginary possibility,\u201d <em>Mason v.

United States, </em>227 U.S. 131, 144, 33 S.Ct. 226, 57 L.Ed. 450 (1913). The threat is sufficiently realistic where the information \u201cwould furnish a link in the chain of evidence needed to prosecute the claimant [of the privilege] for a . . . crime,\u201d <em>Hoffman v. United States, </em>341 U.S. 479, 486, 71 S.Ct. 814, 818, 95 L.Ed. 1118 (1951), or if the information would supply \u201can \u2018investigatory lead\u2019, [or produce] . . . evidence . . . by focusing investigation on a witness as a result of his compelled disclosures.\u201d <em>Kastigar v. United States, </em>406 U.S. 441, 460, 92 S.Ct. 1653, 1665, 32 L.Ed.2d 212 (1972). Thus, even assuming that Detective Yates explicitly asked appellant only for her knowledge about Harris\u2019 or others\u2019 drug dealings, the information which such a question would elicit could reasonably be foreseen to incriminate \u2014 and, according to Yates, did so incriminate \u2014 appellant of complicity in the very crime for which she was ultimately indicted. The government thus mistakes the formal cast of Yates\u2019 question for what it may in fact have been designed to elicit. <em>See Crawford v. United States, </em>219 F.2d 207 (5th Cir. 1955) (statements involuntary where induced by offer of \u201cbargain\u201d in which defendant would incriminate others).</p>\n<p id=\"b919-11\">Moreover, we cannot say from this record that the officers did not, in fact ask appellant about her own involvement with narcotics. In fact, somewhere in the conversation that was \u201cbroken off back and forth,\u201d tr. 71, appellant allegedly provided information about her own drug usage and involvement in narcotics transactions. We thus must reject the government\u2019s argument that the record unambiguously establishes that Yates did not ask appellant about her own involvement and that her statements resulted from something other than the inducements offered to her.</p>\n</footnote>\n<footnote label=\"37\">\n<p id=\"b919-12\">.

We note, in contrast, that the prosecutor was quite well prepared to handle appellant\u2019s alleged admissions. Although no mention was made of appellant\u2019s statements in the prosecution\u2019s case-in-chief, perhaps because of doubts as to whether they could withstand a <em>Miranda </em>challenge, see note 35, <em>supra, </em>the prosecutor had Detective Yates ready to testify in rebuttal to Ms. Powe\u2019s testimony.</p>\n</footnote>\n<footnote label=\"41\">\n<p id=\"b919-16\">. In what is yet another odd occurrence in this unusual case, counsel\u2019s affirmation to the court that appellant would claim to have said nothing to the police was provoked by the <em>prosecutor\u2019s </em>objection to defense counsel\u2019s asking the witness whether she made any statements.

The trial judge did not indicate the basis for his concern over the officer\u2019s testimony, but there are at least three explanations for his ruling. First, he may have found that the admissions were in fact involuntary, but erroneously thought them admissible for impeachment purposes under <em>Harris. See </em>note 22, <em>supra. </em>Alternatively, he may have found that the admissions were obtained through a violation of <em>Miranda </em>principles, see note 35 <em>supra, </em>and thought that no further inquiry into voluntariness was required. Finally, he may have found that <em>Miranda </em>was violated, but that the statements were voluntary. If so, however, he should have indicated the latter finding on the record with \u201cunmistakable clarity.\u201d <em>Sims v. Georgia, </em>385 U.S. 538, 544, 87 S.Ct. 639, 17 L.Ed.2d 593 (1967).</p>\n</footnote>\n<footnote label=\"43\">\n<p id=\"b920-5\">. Indeed, the trial judge, by <em>sua sponte </em>instructing the jurors on the limited consideration which they could give to Detective Yates\u2019 testimony, assumed a greater role than that of the \u201cpassive bystander.\u201d</p>\n</footnote>\n<footnote label=\"44\">\n<p id=\"b920-6\">. There is absolutely no indication in the record, nor has it been suggested by either party, that defense counsel\u2019s failure to object to the admissibility of appellant\u2019s statements was a deliberate tactical decision.</p>\n<p id=\"b920-7\">At oral argument, appellate counsel originally speculated that trial counsel\u2019s failure to object might have been due to counsel\u2019s unpreparedness on this point, appellant having told him that she had made no statements. After reviewing his notes subsequent to oral argument, appellate counsel \u201crecalled that he had been told by trial counsel that he [trial counsel] was aware the Government would introduce statements, but that his client told him there were no statements and that trial counsel\u2019s preparation was based on that assumption.\u201d Appellant\u2019s Motion to Amend Record of Oral Argument. If appellate counsel\u2019s recollections are indeed correct, then by relying solely on whatever appellant told him and failing to conduct any independent investigation of the circumstances of the interrogation by interviewing the officers who conducted it, trial counsel appears to have breached one of the basic duties owed to a client. <em>See United States v. Decoster (Decoster I), </em>159 U.S.App.D.C. 326, 333, 487 F.2d 1197, 1204 (1973) (\u201cCounsel must conduct appropriate investigations, both factual and legal, to determine what matters of defense can be developed.\u201d).</p>\n</footnote>\n<footnote label=\"45\">\n<p id=\"b920-13\">.

The time to explore the underlying matters, if such were needed, was at the trial, yet none of the participants therein felt that clarification was necessary. It is only on this appeal that possible ambiguities of constitutional dimension are perceived.</p>\n<p id=\"b922-12\">The Government\u2019s position on appeal is that appellant\u2019s statements were not involuntary because Officer Yates asked her to cooperate only by incriminating others, not by incriminating herself. In other words, the \u201cconfession,\u201d whose voluntariness is now to be determined on remand, was never asked for at all by the police; what they asked for and expected was information on other traffickers. The information as to her own guilt was volunteered by Powe, and unexpected by the officers. On the record, this is a reasonable interpretation now, as it was at the trial. If defense counsel thought otherwise, that these statements were involuntary, that they were coerced or extorted, or persuaded, and thus on the Supreme Court decisions relied on by my colleagues were \u201cinvoluntary,\u201d he should have apprised the trial judge of that and conducted an inquiry outside of the jury to make his case. This not having been done, we are now entitled to take this evidence, as all other evidence subject to varying interpretation <em>post hoc, </em>on the version which supports the judgment of the trial court.</p>\n<p id=\"b922-13\">I do not subscribe to the interpretation that this record \u201csquarely raised the issue of voluntariness and should have alerted the trial judge to the possibility that appellant\u2019s alleged incriminations were induced by \u2018any direct or implied promises, however slight.\u2019 \u201d Of course there were offers and inducements, but the question is for what? <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"849\">*849</page-number>The police wanted the accused\u2019s cooperation to land other and bigger traffickers; they had the goods on her, they needed no confession, she was only a one tablet case anyway. To put the matter most favorably for the accused, the record shows by hindsight that the evidence was susceptible to different interpretations. Being subject to different interpretations, the time to clarify the matter was right then at the trial, but apparently defense counsel did not take the interpretation now derived from the written record by my colleagues, nor did the trial judge.</p>\n<p id=\"b923-5\">While it is correct to impose upon the trial judge the duty to take <em>sua sponte </em>action where there is a plain violation of defendant\u2019s rights put before him, and the defense lawyer omits to take the proper action, it is a far different thing to impose upon the trial judge the duty <em>sua sponte </em>to conduct inquiries into other matters which the defense lawyer does not choose to go into. Here the testimony is now argued to be ambiguous, the interpretation urged by the Government was apparently also that of defense counsel, the defense counsel left it that.way, and now we are entitled to take the testimony on the interpretation supporting the judgment below.</p>\n<p id=\"b923-6\">If we were called upon to remand a case every time there was ambiguous matter in the record which, if given the interpretation after further inquiry as now urged upon us, might constitute a denial of constitutional rights, we would find something in almost every case justifying a remand on the theory that substantial violation of a constitutional right might be discovered by further inquiry. This is but one of many, many cases in which we could remand in an effort to produce \u201cthe perfect trial\u201d \u2014 which probably has never occurred. The majority have added a new red light to the kaleidoscope of warning signals previously sent down to the District Court and now prominently displayed in front of every trial judge. If the trial bench were a cockpit, and the trial judges pilots, the aircraft would already be unflyable. I therefore respectfully dissent.</p>\n</opinion>\n</casebody>\n",
